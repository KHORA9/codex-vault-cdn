That of\r\nOctober the 17th, came to hand only February the 23d. How it happened to\r\nbe four months on the way, I cannot tell, as I never knew by what hand\r\nit came. Looking over my letter of January the 12th, I remark an error\r\nof the word \"probable\" instead of \"improbable,\" which doubtless, however,\r\nyou had been able to correct.\r\n\r\nYour thoughts on the subject of the declaration of rights, in the letter\r\nof October the 17th, I have weighed with great satisfaction. Some of them\r\nhad not occurred to me before, but were acknowledged just in the moment\r\nthey were presented to my mind. In the arguments in favor of a declaration\r\nof rights, you omit one which has great weight with me; the legal check\r\nwhich it puts into the hands of the judiciary. This is a body, which, if\r\nrendered independent and kept strictly to their own department, merits\r\ngreat confidence for their learning and integrity. In fact, what degree\r\nof confidence would be too much, for a body composed of such men as\r\nWythe, Blair and Pendleton? On characters like these, the \"_civium ardor\r\nprava jubentium_\" would make no impression. I am happy to find that, on\r\nthe whole, you are a friend to this amendment. The declaration of rights\r\nis, like all other human blessings, alloyed with some inconveniences,\r\nand not accomplishing fully its object. But the good in this instance,\r\nvastly overweighs the evil. I cannot refrain from making short answers\r\nto the objections which your letter states to have been raised. 1. That\r\nthe rights in question are reserved, by the manner in which the federal\r\npowers are granted. Answer. A constitutive act may, certainly, be so\r\nformed, as to need no declaration of rights. The act itself has the\r\nforce of a declaration, as far as it goes; and if it goes to all material\r\npoints, nothing more is wanting. In the draught of a constitution which\r\nI had once a thought of proposing in Virginia, and printed afterwards, I\r\nendeavored to reach all the great objects of public liberty, and did not\r\nmean to add a declaration of rights. Probably the object was imperfectly\r\nexecuted; but the deficiencies would have been supplied by others, in the\r\ncourse of discussion. But in a constitutive act which leaves some precious\r\narticles unnoticed, and raises implications against others, a declaration\r\nof rights becomes necessary, by way of supplement. This is the case of\r\nour new federal Constitution. This instrument forms us into one State,\r\nas to certain objects, and gives us a legislative and executive body for\r\nthese objects. It should, therefore, guard us against their abuses of\r\npower, within the field submitted to them. 2. A positive declaration of\r\nsome essential rights could not be obtained in the requisite latitude.\r\nAnswer. Half a loaf is better than no bread. If we cannot secure all our\r\nrights, let us secure what we can. 3. The limited powers of the federal\r\ngovernment, and jealousy of the subordinate governments, afford a security\r\nwhich exists in no other instance. Answer. The first member of this seems\r\nresolvable into the first objection before stated. The jealousy of the\r\nsubordinate governments is a precious reliance. But observe that those\r\ngovernments are only agents. They must have principles furnished them,\r\nwhereon to found their opposition. The declaration of rights will be\r\nthe text, whereby they will try all the acts of the federal government.\r\nIn this view, it is necessary to the federal government also; as by the\r\nsame text, they may try the opposition of the subordinate governments.\r\n4. Experience proves the inefficacy of a bill of rights. True. But\r\nthough it is not absolutely efficacious under all circumstances, it is\r\nof great potency always, and rarely inefficacious. A brace the more will\r\noften keep up the building which would have fallen, with that brace the\r\nless. There is a remarkable difference between the characters of the\r\ninconveniences which attend a declaration of rights, and those which\r\nattend the want of it. The inconveniences of the declaration are, that\r\nit may cramp government in its useful exertions. But the evil of this\r\nis short-lived, moderate and reparable. The inconveniences of the want\r\nof a declaration are permanent, afflicting and irreparable. They are in\r\nconstant progression from bad to worse. The executive, in our governments,\r\nis not the sole, it is scarcely the principal object of my jealousy. The\r\ntyranny of the legislatures is the most formidable dread at present, and\r\nwill be for many years. That of the executive will come in its turn; but\r\nit will be at a remote period. I know there are some among us, who would\r\nnow establish a monarchy. But they are inconsiderable in number and weight\r\nof character. The rising race are all republicans. We were educated in\r\nroyalism; no wonder, if some of us retain that idolatry still. Our young\r\npeople are educated in republicanism; an apostasy from that to royalism,\r\nis unprecedented and impossible. I am much pleased with the prospect\r\nthat a declaration of rights will be added; and I hope it will be done in\r\nthat way, which will not endanger the whole frame of government, or any\r\nessential part of it.\r\n\r\nI have hitherto avoided public news in my letters to you, because your\r\nsituation insured you a communication of my letters to Mr. Jay. This\r\ncircumstance being changed, I shall, in future, indulge myself in these\r\ndetails to you. There had been some slight hopes, that an accommodation\r\nmight be effected between the Turks and two empires; but these hopes do\r\nnot strengthen, and the season is approaching which will put an end to\r\nthem, for another campaign, at least. The accident to the King of England\r\nhas had great influence on the affairs of Europe. His mediation, joined\r\nwith that of Prussia, would certainly have kept Denmark quiet, and so\r\nhave left the two empires in the hands of the Turks and Swedes. But the\r\ninactivity to which England is reduced, leaves Denmark more free, and\r\nshe will probably go on in opposition to Sweden. The King of Prussia,\r\ntoo, had advanced so far, that he can scarcely retire. This is rendered\r\nthe more difficult, by the troubles he has excited in Poland. He cannot\r\nwell abandon the party he had brought forward there; so that it is very\r\npossible he may be engaged in the ensuing campaign. France will be quiet\r\nthis year, because this year, at least, is necessary for settling her\r\nfuture constitution. The States will meet the 27th of April; and the\r\npublic mind will, I think, by that time, be ripe for a just decision of\r\nthe question, whether they shall vote by orders or persons. I think there\r\nis a majority of the Nobles already for the latter. If so, their affairs\r\ncannot but go on well. Besides settling for themselves a tolerably free\r\nconstitution, perhaps as free a one as the nation is as yet prepared\r\nto bear, they will fund their public debts. This will give them such a\r\ncredit, as will enable them to borrow any money they may want, and of\r\ncourse, to take the field again, when they think proper. And I believe\r\nthey mean to take the field, as soon as they can. The pride of every\r\nindividual in the nation, suffers under the ignominies they have lately\r\nbeen exposed to, and I think the States General will give money for a war,\r\nto wipe off the reproach. There have arisen new bickerings between this\r\ncourt and that of the Hague; and the papers which have passed, show the\r\nmost bitter acrimony rankling at the heart of this ministry. They have\r\nrecalled their ambassador from the Hague, without appointing a successor.\r\nThey have given a note to the Diet of Poland, which shows a disapprobation\r\nof their measures. The insanity of the King of England has been fortunate\r\nfor them, as it gives them time to put their house in order. The English\r\npapers tell you the King is well; and even the English ministry say so.\r\nThey will naturally set the best foot foremost; and they guard his person\r\nso well, that it is difficult for the public to contradict them. The King\r\nis probably better, but not well, by a great deal. 1. He has been bled,\r\nand judicious physicians say, that in his exhausted state, nothing could\r\nhave induced a recurrence to bleeding, but symptoms of relapse. 2. The\r\nPrince of Wales tells the Irish deputation, he will give them a definitive\r\nanswer in some days; but if the King had been well, he could have given\r\nit at once. 3. They talk of passing a standing law, for providing a\r\nregency in similar cases. They apprehend then, they are not yet clear of\r\nthe danger of wanting a regency. 4. They have carried the King to church;\r\nbut it was his private chapel. If he be well, why do not they show him\r\npublicly to the nation, and raise them from that consternation into which\r\nthey have been thrown, by the prospect of being delivered over to the\r\nprofligate hands of the Prince of Wales. In short, judging from little\r\nfacts, which are known in spite of their teeth, the King is better, but\r\nnot well. Possibly he is getting well, but still, time will be wanting\r\nto satisfy even the ministry, that it is not merely a lucid interval.\r\nConsequently, they cannot interrupt France this year in the settlement of\r\nher affairs, and after this year it will be too late.\r\n\r\nAs you will be in a situation to know when the leave of absence will be\r\ngranted me, which I have asked, will you be so good as to communicate it,\r\nby a line, to Mr. Lewis and Mr. Eppes? I hope to see you in the summer,\r\nand that if you are not otherwise engaged, you will encamp with me at\r\nMonticello for awhile.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere attachment, dear Sir, your affectionate\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS PAINE.\r\n\r\n                                                     Paris, March 17, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--My last letter to you extended from December the 23d to January\r\nthe 11th. A confidential opportunity now arising, I can acknowledge the\r\nreceipt of yours of January the 15th, at the date of which you could not\r\nhave received mine.\r\n\r\nYou knew, long ago, that the meeting of the States is to be at Versailles\r\non the 27th of April. This country is entirely occupied in its elections,\r\nwhich go on quietly and well. The Duke d'Orleans is elected for Villers\r\nCotterels. The Prince of Condé has lost the election he aimed at; nor is\r\nit certain he can be elected anywhere. We have no news from Auvergne,\r\nwhither the Marquis de La Fayette is gone. In general, all the men of\r\ninfluence in the country are gone into the several provinces to get their\r\nfriends elected, or be elected themselves. Since my letter to you, a\r\ntumult arose in Bretagne, in which four or five lives were lost. They are\r\nnow quieter, and this is the only instance of a life lost, as yet, in this\r\nrevolution. The public mind is now so far ripened by time and discussion,\r\nthat there seems to be but one opinion on the principal points. The\r\nquestion of voting by persons of orders is the most controverted; but even\r\nthat seems to have gained already a majority among the Nobles. I fear more\r\nfrom the number of the Assembly, than from any other cause. Twelve hundred\r\npersons are difficult to keep to order, and will be so, especially, till\r\nthey shall have had time to frame rules of order. Their funds continue\r\nstationary, and at the level they have stood at for some years past. We\r\nhear so little of the parliaments for some time past, that one is hardly\r\nsensible of their existence. This unimportance is probably the forerunner\r\nof their total re-modification by the nation. The article of legislation,\r\nis the only interesting one on which the court has not explicitly declared\r\nitself to the nation. The Duke d'Orleans has given instructions to his\r\nproxies in the baillages, which would be deemed bold in England, and are\r\nreasonable beyond the reach of an Englishman, who, slumbering under a kind\r\nof half reformation in politics and religion, is not excited by anything\r\nhe sees or feels, to question the remains of prejudice. The writers of\r\nthis country, now taking the field freely and unrestrained, or rather\r\ninvolved by prejudice, will rouse us all from the errors in which we have\r\nbeen hitherto rocked.\r\n\r\nWe had, at one time, some hope that an accommodation would have been\r\neffected between the Turks and two empires. Probably the taking Oczakow,\r\nwhile it has attached the Empress more to the Crimea, is not important\r\nenough to the Turks, to make them consent to peace. These hopes are\r\nvanishing. Nor does there seem any prospect of peace between Russia and\r\nSweden. The palsied condition of England leaves it probable that Denmark\r\nwill pursue its hostilities against Sweden. It does not seem certain\r\nwhether the King of Prussia has advanced so far in that mediation, and in\r\nthe troubles he has excited in Poland, as to be obliged to become a party.\r\nNor will his becoming a party draw in this country, the present year, if\r\nEngland remains quiet. Papers which lately passed between this court and\r\nthe government of Holland, prove that this nourishes its discontent, and\r\nonly waits to put its house in order, before it interposes. They have\r\nrecalled their ambassador from the Hague, without naming a successor. The\r\nKing of Sweden, not thinking that Russia and Denmark are enough for him,\r\nhas arrested a number of his Nobles, of principal rank and influence. It\r\nis a bold measure, at least, and he is too boyish a character to authorize\r\nus to presume it a wise one, merely because he has adopted it. His army\r\nwas before disgusted. He now puts the Nobles and all their dependents on\r\nthe same side, and they are sure of armed support, by Russia on the north,\r\nand Denmark on the south. He can have no salvation but in the King of\r\nPrussia.\r\n\r\nI have received two letters from Ledyard, the one dated Alexandria, August\r\nthe 15th, the other Grand Cairo, September the 10th; and one lately from\r\nAdmiral Paul Jones, dated St. Petersburg, January the 31st. He was just\r\narrived there, on the call of the Empress, and was uncertain where he\r\nshould be employed the next campaign. Mr. Littlepage has returned from the\r\nBlack Sea to Warsaw, where he has been perfectly received by the King. I\r\nsaw this from under the King's own hand, and was pleased with the parental\r\nexpressions towards him.\r\n\r\nWe have no news from America later than the middle of January. My letters\r\ninform me that even the friends of the new Constitution have come over\r\nto the expediency of adding a declaration of rights. There is reason to\r\nhope that this will be proposed by Congress to the several legislatures,\r\nand that the plan of New York for calling a new convention, will be\r\nrejected. Hitherto no State had acceded to it but Virginia, in which Henry\r\nand anti-federalism had got full possession of their legislature. But\r\nthe people are better disposed. My departure for America is likely to be\r\nretarded, by the want of a Congress to give me permission. I must obtain\r\nit from the new government. I am anxious to know how much we ought to\r\nbelieve of the recovery of the King of England. By putting little facts\r\ntogether, I see that he is not well. Mr. Rumsey (who came in while I was\r\nwriting the preceding page) tells me you have a long letter ready for me.\r\nI shall be happy to receive it.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere attachment, dear Sir, your affectionate\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\n                                                     Paris, March 18, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Your favor of November the 29th, 1788, came to hand the last\r\nmonth. How it happened that mine of August, 1787, was fourteen months on\r\nits way, is inconceivable. I do not recollect by what conveyance I sent\r\nit. I had concluded, however, either that it had miscarried, or that\r\nyou had become indolent, as most of our countrymen are, in matters of\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\nThe change in this country since you left it, is such as you can form\r\nno idea of. The frivolities of conversation have given way entirely to\r\npolitics. Men, women and children talk nothing else; and all, you know,\r\ntalk a great deal. The press groans with daily productions, which, in\r\npoint of boldness, makes an Englishman stare, who hitherto has thought\r\nhimself the boldest of men. A complete revolution in this government has,\r\nwithin the space of two years, (for it began with the Notables of 1787,)\r\nbeen effected merely by the force of public opinion, aided, indeed, by\r\nthe want of money, which the dissipations of the court had brought on.\r\nAnd this revolution has not cost a single life, unless we charge to it\r\na little riot lately in Bretagne, which began about the price of bread,\r\nbecame afterwards political, and ended in the loss of four or five\r\nlives. The assembly of the States General begins the 27th of April. The\r\nrepresentation of the people will be perfect. But they will be alloyed by\r\nan equal number of nobility and clergy. The first great question they will\r\nhave to decide will be, whether they shall vote by orders or persons. And\r\nI have hopes that the majority of the Nobles are already disposed to join\r\nthe Tiers Etat, in deciding that the vote shall be by persons. This is\r\nthe opinion _a la mode_ at present, and mode has acted a wonderful part in\r\nthe present instance. All the handsome young women, for example, are for\r\nthe Tiers Etat, and this is an army more powerful in France, than the two\r\nhundred thousand men of the King. Add to this, that the court itself is\r\nfor the Tiers Etat, as the only agent which can relieve their wants; not\r\nby giving money themselves, (they are squeezed to the last drop,) but by\r\npressing it from the non-contributing orders. The King stands engaged to\r\npretend no more to the power of laying, continuing or appropriating taxes;\r\nto call the States General periodically; to submit _lettres de cachet_\r\nto legal restrictions; to consent to freedom of the press; and that all\r\nthis shall be fixed by a fundamental constitution, which shall bind his\r\nsuccessors. He has not offered a participation in the legislature, but\r\nit will surely be insisted on. The public mind is so ripened on all these\r\nsubjects, that there seems to be now but one opinion. The clergy, indeed,\r\nthink separately, and the old men among the Nobles; but their voice is\r\nsuppressed by the general one of the nation. The writings published on\r\nthis occasion are, some of them, very valuable; because, unfettered by\r\nthe prejudices under which the English labor, they give a full scope to\r\nreason, and strike out truths, as yet unperceived and unacknowledged on\r\nthe other side the channel. An Englishman, dosing under a kind of half\r\nreformation, is not excited to think by such gross absurdities as stare a\r\nFrenchman in the face, wherever he looks, whether it be towards the throne\r\nor the altar. In fine, I believe this nation will, in the course of the\r\npresent year, have as full a portion of liberty dealt out to them, as the\r\nnation can bear at present, considering how uninformed the mass of their\r\npeople is. This circumstance will prevent the immediate establishment\r\nof the trial by jury. The palsied state of the executive in England is a\r\nfortunate circumstance for France, as it will give her time to arrange her\r\naffairs internally. The consolidation and funding their debts, will give\r\ngovernment a credit which will enable them to do what they please. For\r\nthe present year, the war will be confined to the two empires and Denmark,\r\nagainst Turkey and Sweden. It is not yet evident whether Prussia will be\r\nengaged. If the disturbances of Poland break out into overt acts, it will\r\nbe a power divided in itself, and so of no weight. Perhaps, by the next\r\nyear, England and France may be ready to take the field. It will depend on\r\nthe former principally; for the latter, though she may be then able, must\r\nwish a little time to see her new arrangements well under way. The English\r\npapers and English ministry say the King is well. He is better but not\r\nwell; no malady requires a longer time to insure against its return, than\r\ninsanity. Time alone can distinguish accidental insanity from habitual\r\nlunacy.\r\n\r\nThe operations which have taken place in America lately, fill me with\r\npleasure. In the first place, they realize the confidence I had, that\r\nwhenever our affairs go obviously wrong, the good sense of the people will\r\ninterpose, and set them to rights. The example of changing a constitution,\r\nby assembling the wise men of the State, instead of assembling armies,\r\nwill be worth as much to the world as the former examples we had given\r\nthem. The Constitution, too, which was the result of our deliberations,\r\nis unquestionably the wisest ever yet presented to men, and some of the\r\naccommodations of interest which it has adopted, are greatly pleasing\r\nto me, who have before had occasions of seeing how difficult those\r\ninterests were to accommodate. A general concurrence of opinion seems\r\nto authorize us to say, it has some defects. I am one of those who\r\nthink it a defect, that the important rights, not placed in security\r\nby the frame of the Constitution itself, were not explicitly secured\r\nby a supplementary declaration. There are rights which it is useless to\r\nsurrender to the government, and which governments have yet always been\r\nfound to invade. These are the rights of thinking, and publishing our\r\nthoughts by speaking or writing; the right of free commerce; the right of\r\npersonal freedom. There are instruments for administering the government,\r\nso peculiarly trust-worthy, that we should never leave the legislature\r\nat liberty to change them. The new Constitution has secured these in\r\nthe executive and legislative department; but not in the judiciary. It\r\nshould have established trials by the people themselves, that is to say,\r\nby jury. There are instruments so dangerous to the rights of the nation,\r\nand which place them so totally at the mercy of their governors, that\r\nthose governors, whether legislative or executive, should be restrained\r\nfrom keeping such instruments on foot, but in well-defined cases. Such\r\nan instrument is a standing army. We are now allowed to say, such a\r\ndeclaration of rights, as a supplement to the constitution where that is\r\nsilent, is wanting, to secure us in these points. The general voice has\r\nlegitimated this objection. It has not, however, authorized me to consider\r\nas a real defect, what I thought and still think one, the perpetual\r\nre-eligibility of the President. But three States out of eleven, having\r\ndeclared against this, we must suppose we are wrong, according to the\r\nfundamental law of every society, the _lex majoris partis_, to which we\r\nare bound to submit. And should the majority change their opinion, and\r\nbecome sensible that this trait in their Constitution is wrong, I would\r\nwish it to remain uncorrected, as long as we can avail ourselves of the\r\nservices of our great leader, whose talents and whose weight of character,\r\nI consider as peculiarly necessary to get the government so under way, as\r\nthat it may afterwards be carried on by subordinate characters.\r\n\r\nI must give you sincere thanks, for the details of small news contained in\r\nyour letter. You know how precious that kind of information is to a person\r\nabsent from his country, and how difficult it is to be procured. I hope,\r\nto receive soon permission to visit America this summer, and to possess\r\nmyself anew, by conversation with my countrymen, of their spirit and their\r\nideas. I know only the Americans of the year 1784. They tell me this is\r\nto be much a stranger to those of 1789. This renewal of acquaintance is no\r\nindifferent matter to one, acting at such a distance, as that instructions\r\ncannot be received hot and hot. One of my pleasures, too, will be that of\r\ntalking over the old and new with you. In the meantime, and at all times,\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR WILLARD.\r\n\r\n                                                     Paris, March 24, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have been lately honored with your letter of September the\r\n24th, 1788, accompanied by a diploma for a Doctorate of Laws, which the\r\nUniversity of Harvard has been pleased to confer on me. Conscious how\r\nlittle I merit it, I am the more sensible of their goodness and indulgence\r\nto a stranger, who has had no means of serving or making himself known to\r\nthem. I beg you to return them my grateful thanks, and to assure them that\r\nthis notice from so eminent a seat of science, is very precious to me.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable publications we have had in France, for a year or two\r\npast, are the following: \"Les Voyages d'Anacharsis par l'Abbé Barthelemi,\"\r\nseven volumes, octavo. This is a very elegant digest of whatever is known\r\nof the Greeks; useless, indeed, to him who has read the Original authors,\r\nbut very proper for one who reads modern languages only. The works of\r\nthe King of Prussia. The Berlin edition is in sixteen volumes, octavo.\r\nIt is said to have been gutted at Berlin; and here it has been still\r\nmore mangled. There are one or two other editions published abroad, which\r\npretend to have rectified the maltreatment both of Berlin and Paris. Some\r\ntime will be necessary to settle the public mind, as to the best edition.\r\n\r\nMontignot has given us the original Greek, and a French translation of\r\nthe seventh book of Ptolemy's great work, under the title of \"Etat des\r\nEtoiles fixes au second Siecle,\" in quarto. He has given the designation\r\nof the same stars by Flamstead and Beyer, and their position in the year\r\n1786. A very remarkable work is the \"Mechanique Analytique,\" of Le Grange,\r\nin quarto. He is allowed to be the greatest mathematician now living,\r\nand his personal worth is equal to his science. The object of his work\r\nis to reduce all the principles of mechanics to the single one of the\r\nequilibrium, and to give a simple formula applicable to them all. The\r\nsubject is treated in the algebraic method, without diagrams to assist\r\nthe conception. My present occupations not permitting me to read anything\r\nwhich requires a long and undisturbed attention, I am not able to give you\r\nthe character of this work from my own examination. It has been received\r\nwith great approbation in Europe. In Italy, the works of Spallanzani on\r\nDigestion and Generation, are valuable. Though, perhaps, too minute, and\r\ntherefore tedious, he has developed some useful truths, and his book is\r\nwell worth attention; it is in four volumes, octavo. Clavigaro, an Italian\r\nalso, who has resided thirty-six years in Mexico, has given us a history\r\nof that country, which certainly merits more respect than any other\r\nwork on the same subject. He corrects many errors of Dr. Robertson; and\r\nthough sound philosophy will disapprove many of his ideas, we may still\r\nconsider it as an useful work, and assuredly the best we possess on the\r\nsame subject. It is in four thin volumes, small quarto. De La Lande has\r\nnot yet published a fifth volume.\r\n\r\nThe chemical dispute about the conversion and reconversion of air and\r\nwater, continues still undecided. Arguments and authorities are so\r\nbalanced, that we may still safely believe, as our fathers did before us,\r\nthat these principles are distinct. A schism of another kind, has taken\r\nplace among the chemists. A particular set of them here, have undertaken\r\nto remodel all the terms of the science, and to give to every substance\r\na new name, the composition, and especially the termination of which,\r\nshall define the relation in which it stands to other substances of the\r\nsame family. But the science seems too much in its infancy as yet, for\r\nthis reformation; because, in fact, the reformation of this year must be\r\nreformed again the next year, and so on, changing the names of substances\r\nas often as new experiments develop properties in them undiscovered\r\nbefore. The new nomenclature has, accordingly, been already proved to\r\nneed numerous and important reformations. Probably it will not prevail.\r\nIt is espoused by the minority only here, and by very few, indeed, of the\r\nforeign chemists. It is particularly rejected in England.\r\n\r\nIn the arts, I think two of our countrymen have presented the most\r\nimportant inventions. Mr. Paine, the author of \"Common Sense,\" has\r\ninvented an iron bridge, which promises to be cheaper by a great deal\r\nthan stone, and to admit of a much greater arch. He supposes it may be\r\nventured for an arch of five hundred feet. He has obtained a patent for\r\nit in England, and is now executing the first experiment with an arch of\r\nbetween ninety and one hundred feet. Mr. Rumsey has also obtained a patent\r\nfor his navigation by the force of steam, in England, and is soliciting a\r\nsimilar one here. His principal merit is in the improvement of the boiler,\r\nand, instead of the complicated machinery of oars and paddles, proposed\r\nby others, the substitution of so simple a thing as the reaction of a\r\nstream of water on his vessel. He is building a sea vessel at this time in\r\nEngland, and she will be ready for an experiment in May. He has suggested\r\na great number of mechanical improvements in a variety of branches; and\r\nupon the whole, is the most original and the greatest mechanical genius\r\nI have ever seen. The return of La Peyrouse (whenever that shall happen)\r\nwill probably add to our knowledge in Geography, Botany, and Natural\r\nHistory. What a field have we at our doors to signalize ourselves in!\r\nThe Botany of America is far from being exhausted, its Mineralogy is\r\nuntouched, and its Natural History or Zoology, totally mistaken and\r\nmisrepresented. As far as I have seen, there is not one single species of\r\nterrestrial birds common to Europe and America, and I question if there\r\nbe a single species of quadrupeds. (Domestic animals are to be excepted.)\r\nIt is for such institutions as that over which you preside so worthily,\r\nSir, to do justice to our country, its productions and its genius. It is\r\nthe work to which the young men, whom you are forming, should lay their\r\nhands. We have spent the prime of our lives in procuring them the precious\r\nblessing of liberty. Let them spend theirs in showing that it is the great\r\nparent of _science_ and of virtue; and that a nation will be great in\r\nboth, always in proportion as it is free. Nobody wishes more warmly for\r\nthe success of your good exhortations on this subject, than he who has the\r\nhonor to be, with sentiments of great esteem and respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. SARSFIELD.\r\n\r\n                                                      Paris, April 3, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,--I could not name to you the day of my departure from Paris, because\r\nI do not know it. I have not yet received my congé, though I hope to\r\nreceive it soon, and to leave this some time in May, so that I may be back\r\nbefore the winter.\r\n\r\n_Impost_ is a duty paid on any imported article, in the _moment of its\r\nimportation_, and of course it is collected in the seaports only. _Excise_\r\nis a duty on any article, whether imported or raised at home, and paid\r\nin the _hands of the consumer or retailer_; consequently, it is collected\r\nthrough the whole country. These are the true definitions of these words\r\nas used in England, and in the greater part of the United States. But in\r\nMassachusetts, they have perverted the word excise to mean a tax on all\r\nliquors, whether paid in the moment of importation or at a later moment,\r\nand on nothing else. So that in reading the debates of the Massachusetts\r\nconvention, you must give this last meaning to the word excise.\r\n\r\n_Rotation_ is the change of officers required by the laws at certain\r\nepochs, and _in a certain order_: thus, in Virginia, our justices of the\r\npeace are made sheriffs one after the other, each remaining in office two\r\nyears, and then yielding it to his next brother in order of seniority.\r\nThis is the just and classical meaning of the word. But in America, we\r\nhave extended it (for want of a proper word) to all cases of officers who\r\nmust be necessarily changed at a fixed epoch, though the successor be not\r\npointed out in any particular order, but comes in by free election. By the\r\nterm _rotation in office_, then we mean _an obligation on the holder of\r\nthat office to go out at a certain period_. In our first Confederation,\r\nthe principle of rotation was established in the office of President of\r\nCongress, who could serve but one year in three, and in that of a member\r\nof Congress, who could serve but three years in six.\r\n\r\nI believe all the countries in Europe determine their standard of money\r\nin gold as well as silver. Thus, the laws of England direct that a pound\r\nTroy of gold, of twenty-two carats fine, shall be cut into forty-four\r\nand a half guineas, each of which shall be worth twenty-one and a half\r\nshillings, that is, into 956 3-4 shillings. This establishes the shilling\r\nat 5.518 grains of _pure_ gold. They direct that a pound of silver,\r\nconsisting of 11 1-10 ounces of pure silver and 9-10 of an ounce alloy,\r\nshall be cut into sixty-two shillings. This establishes the shilling at\r\n85.93 grains of pure silver, and, consequently, the proportion of gold to\r\nsilver as 85.93 to 5.518, or as 15.57 to 1. If this be the true proportion\r\nbetween the value of gold and silver at the general market of Europe,\r\nthen the value of the shilling, depending on two standards, is the same,\r\nwhether a payment be made in gold or in silver. But if the proportion of\r\nthe general market at Europe be as fifteen to one, then the Englishman who\r\nowes a pound weight of gold at Amsterdam, if he sends the pound of gold to\r\npay it, sends 1043.72 shillings; if he sends fifteen pounds of silver, he\r\nsends only 1030.5 shillings; if he pays half in gold and half in silver,\r\nhe pays only 1037.11 shillings. And this medium between the two standards\r\nof gold and silver, we must consider as furnishing the true medium value\r\nof the shilling. If the parliament should now order the pound of gold (of\r\none-twelfth alloy as before) to be put into a thousand shillings instead\r\nof nine hundred and fifty-six and three-fourths, leaving the silver as\r\nit is, the medium or true value of the shilling would suffer a change of\r\nhalf the difference; and in the case before stated, to pay a debt of a\r\npound weight of gold, at Amsterdam, if he sent the pound weight of gold,\r\nhe would send 1090.9 shillings; if he sent fifteen pounds of silver, he\r\nwould send 1030.5 shillings; if half in gold and half in silver, he would\r\nsend 1060.7 shillings; which shows that this parliamentary operation would\r\nreduce the value of the shilling in the proportion of 1060.7 to 1037.11.\r\n\r\nNow this is exactly the effect of the late change in the quantity of\r\ngold contained in your louis. Your _marc d'argent fin_ is cut into 53.45\r\nlivres (fifty-three livres and nine sous), the _marc de l'or fin_ was\r\ncut, heretofore, by law, into 784.6 livres (seven hundred and eighty-four\r\nlivres and twelve sous); gold was to silver then as 14.63 to 1. And if\r\nthis was different from the proportion at the markets of Europe, the\r\ntrue value of your livre stood half way between the two standards. By the\r\nordinance of October the 30th, 1785, the _marc_ of pure gold has been cut\r\ninto 828.6 livres. If your standard had been in gold alone, this would\r\nhave reduced the value of your livre in the proportion of 828.6 to 784.6.\r\nBut as you had a standard of silver as well as gold, the true standard is\r\nthe medium between the two; consequently the value of the livre is reduced\r\nonly one-half the difference, that is, as 806.6 to 784.6, which is very\r\nnearly three per cent. Commerce, however, has made a difference of four\r\nper cent., the average value of the pound sterling, formerly twenty-four\r\nlivres, being now twenty-five livres. Perhaps some other circumstance has\r\noccasioned an addition of one per cent. to the change of your standard.\r\n\r\nI fear I have tired you by these details. I did not mean to be so lengthy\r\nwhen I began. I beg you to consider them as an appeal to your judgment,\r\nwhich I value, and from which I will expect a correction, if they are\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very great esteem and attachment, dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE\r\n                                                        Paris, May 6, 1789.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Friend,--As it becomes more and more possible that the Noblesse\r\nwill go wrong, I become uneasy for you. Your principles are decidedly with\r\nthe Tiers Etat, and your instructions against them. A complaisance to the\r\nlatter on some occasions, and an adherence to the former on others, may\r\ngive an appearance of trimming between the two parties, which may lose\r\nyou both. You will, in the end, go over wholly to the Tiers Etat, because\r\nit will be impossible for you to live in a constant sacrifice of your own\r\nsentiments to the prejudices of the Noblesse. But you would be received\r\nby the Tiers Etat at any future day, coldly, and without confidence.\r\nThis appears to me the moment to take at once that honest and manly stand\r\nwith them which your own principles dictate. This will win their hearts\r\nforever, be approved by the world, which marks and honors you as the\r\nman of the people, and will be an eternal consolation to yourself. The\r\nNoblesse, and especially the Noblesse of Auvergne, will always prefer\r\nmen who will do their dirty work for them. You are not made for that.\r\nThey will therefore soon drop you, and the people, in that case, will\r\nperhaps not take you up. Suppose a scission should take place. The Priests\r\nand Nobles will secede, the nation will remain in place, and, with the\r\nKing, will do its own business. If violence should be attempted, where\r\nwill you be? You cannot then take side with the people in opposition\r\nto your own vote, that very vote which will have helped to produce the\r\nscission. Still less can you array yourself against the people. That\r\nis impossible. Your instructions are indeed a difficulty. But to state\r\nthis at its worst it is only a single difficulty, which a single effort\r\nsurmounts. Your instructions can never embarrass you a second time,\r\nwhereas an acquiescence under them will reproduce greater difficulties\r\nevery day, and without end. Besides, a thousand circumstances offer as\r\nmany justifications of your departure from your instructions. Will it\r\nbe impossible to persuade all parties that (as for good legislation two\r\nHouses are necessary) the placing the privileged classes together in one\r\nHouse, and the unprivileged in another, would be better for both than a\r\nscission? I own, I think it would. People can never agree without some\r\nsacrifices; and it appears but a moderate sacrifice in each party, to\r\nmeet on this middle ground. The attempt to bring this about might satisfy\r\nyour instructions, and a failure in it would justify your siding with the\r\npeople, even to those who think instructions are laws of conduct. Forgive\r\nme, my dear friend, if my anxiety for you makes me talk of things I know\r\nnothing about. You must not consider this as advice. I know you and myself\r\ntoo well to presume to offer advice. Receive it merely as the expression\r\nof my uneasiness, and the effusion of that sincere friendship with which\r\nI am, my dear Sir, yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\n                                                        Paris, May 8, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Your favor of January the 26th, to March the 27th, is duly\r\nreceived, and I thank you for the interesting papers it contained. The\r\nanswer of Don Ulloa, however, on the subject of the canal through the\r\nAmerican isthmus, was not among them, though mentioned to be so. If\r\nyou have omitted it through accident, I shall thank you for it at some\r\nfuture occasion, as I wish much to understand that subject thoroughly.\r\nOur American information comes down to the 16th of March. There had\r\nnot yet been members enough assembled of the new Congress to open the\r\ntickets. They expected to do it in a day or two. In the meantime, it was\r\nsaid from all the States, that their vote had been unanimous for General\r\nWashington, and a good majority in favor of Mr. Adams, who is certainly,\r\ntherefore, Vice President. The new government would be supported by very\r\ncordial and very general dispositions in its favor from the people. I\r\nhave not yet seen a list of the new Congress. This delay in the meeting\r\nof the new government, has delayed the determination on my petition for\r\nleave of absence. However, I expect to receive it every day, and am in\r\nreadiness to sail the instant I receive it, so that this is probably the\r\nlast letter I shall write you hence till my return. While there, I shall\r\navail government of the useful information I have received from you, and\r\nshall not fail to profit of any good occasion which may occur, to show the\r\ndifference between your real situation and what it ought to be. I consider\r\nParis and Madrid as the only two points at which Europe and America should\r\ntouch closely, and that a connection at these points should be fostered.\r\n\r\nWe have had, in this city, a very considerable riot, in which about one\r\nhundred people have been probably killed. It was the most unprovoked, and\r\nis, therefore, justly, the most unpitied catastrophe of that kind I ever\r\nknew. Nor did the wretches know what they wanted, except to do mischief.\r\nIt seems to have had no particular connection with the great national\r\nquestion now in agitation. The want of bread is very seriously dreaded\r\nthrough the whole kingdom. Between twenty and thirty ship loads of wheat\r\nand flour has already arrived from the United States, and there will\r\nbe about the same quantity of rice sent from Charleston to this country\r\ndirectly, of which about half has arrived. I presume that between wheat\r\nand rice, one hundred ship loads may be counted on in the whole from us.\r\nParis consumes about a ship load a day (say two hundred and fifty tons).\r\nThe total supply of the West Indies for this year, rests with us, and\r\nthere is almost a famine in Canada and Nova Scotia. The States General\r\nwere opened the day before yesterday. Viewing it as an opera, it was\r\nimposing; as a scene of business, the King's speech was exactly what it\r\nshould have been, and very well delivered; not a word of the Chancellor's\r\nwas heard by anybody, so that, as yet, I have never heard a single guess\r\nat what it was about. Mr. Neckar's was as good as such a number of details\r\nwould permit it to be. The picture of their resources was consoling, and\r\ngenerally plausible. I could have wished him to have dwelt more on those\r\ngreat constitutional reformations, which his \"Rapport au roy\" had prepared\r\nus to expect. But they observe, that these points were proper for the\r\nspeech of the Chancellor. We are in hopes, therefore, they were in that\r\nspeech, which, like the Revelations of St. John, were no revelations at\r\nall. The Noblesse, on coming together, show that they are not as much\r\nreformed in their principles as we had hoped they would be. In fact, there\r\nis real danger of their totally refusing to vote by persons. Some found\r\nhopes on the lower clergy, which constitute four-fifths of the deputies\r\nof that order. If they do not turn the balance in favor of the Tiers\r\nEtat, there is real danger of a scission. But I shall not consider even\r\nthat event as rendering things desperate. If the King will do business\r\nwith the Tiers Etat, which constitutes the nation, it may be well done\r\nwithout Priests or Nobles. From the best information I can obtain, the\r\nKing of England's madness has terminated in an imbecility, which may very\r\npossibly be of long continuance. He is going with his Queen to Germany.\r\nEngland chained to rest, the other parts of Europe may recover or retain\r\ntranquillity.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. LITTLEPAGE.\r\n\r\n                                                        Paris, May 8, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Your favor of February 12th has been duly received, and in\r\nexchange for its information, I shall give you that which you desire\r\nrelative to American affairs. Those of Europe you can learn from other\r\nsources. All our States acceded unconditionally to the new Constitution,\r\nexcept North Carolina and Rhode Island. The latter rejects it in toto.\r\nNorth Carolina neither rejected nor received it, but asked certain\r\namendments before it should receive it. Her amendments concur with those\r\nasked by Virginia, New York and Massachusetts, and consist chiefly in a\r\ndeclaration of rights. Even the warmest friends to the new form begin to\r\nbe sensible it wants the security, and it is pretty generally agreed that\r\na declaration of rights shall be added. New York and Virginia, though\r\nthey have acceded to this government, are less contented with it than the\r\nothers. In New York, it is the effect of the intrigues and influence of\r\nGovernor Clinton, who it is hoped will be exchanged for a Judge Yates.\r\nIn Virginia, it is perhaps the apprehension that the new government will\r\noblige them to pay their debts. Our letters are as late as the 16th of\r\nMarch. There were not yet members enough of the new Congress assembled to\r\nopen the tickets. It was expected there would be in two or three days.\r\nInformation, however, from all the States, gave reason to be satisfied\r\nthat General Washington was elected unanimously, and Mr. John Adams by a\r\nsufficient plurality to ensure his being the Vice President. The elections\r\nto Congress had been almost entirely in favor of persons well-disposed\r\nto the new government, which proves the mass of the people in its favor.\r\nIn general, there are the most favorable dispositions to support it,\r\nand those heretofore disheartened, now write in great confidence of our\r\naffairs. That spirit of luxury which sprung up at the peace, has given\r\nplace to a laudable economy. Home manufactures are encouraged, and the\r\nbalance last year was greatly on the side of exportation. The settlement\r\nof the Western country has gone on with astonishing rapidity. A late\r\nunaccountable event may slacken by scattering it. Spain has granted the\r\nexclusive navigation of the Mississippi, with a large tract of country\r\non the western side of the river, to Col. Morgan of New Jersey, to whom\r\ngreat numbers of settlers are flocking over from Kentucky. While this\r\nmeasure weakens somewhat the United States for the present, it begins\r\nour possession of that country considerably sooner than I had expected,\r\nand without a struggle till no struggle can be made. Great crops of corn\r\nlast year in the United States, and a great demand for it in British and\r\nFrench America, and in Europe. Remarkable deaths are, Gen. Nelson, and\r\nJohn Bannisters, father and son. I expect every day to receive a leave of\r\nabsence for six months, and shall sail within a week after receiving it.\r\nI hope to be back before winter sets in. I have the honor to be, with very\r\ngreat esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                        Paris, May 9, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,--Since my letter of March the 1st, by the way of Havre, and those of\r\nMarch the 12th and 15th, by the way of London, no opportunity of writing\r\nhas occurred, till the present to London.\r\n\r\nThere are no symptoms of accommodation between the Turks and two empires,\r\nnor between Russia and Sweden. The Emperor was, on the 16th of the last\r\nmonth, expected to die, certainly; he was, however, a little better when\r\nthe last news came away, so that hopes were entertained of him; but it\r\nis agreed that he cannot get the better of his complaints ultimately, so\r\nthat his life is not at all counted on. The Danes profess, as yet, to do\r\nno more against Sweden than furnish their stipulated aid. The agitation\r\nof Poland is still violent, though somewhat moderated by the late change\r\nin the demeanor of the King of Prussia. He is much less thrasonic than\r\nhe was. This is imputed to the turn which the English politics may be\r\nrationally expected to take. It is very difficult to get at the true state\r\nof the British King; but from the best information we can get, his madness\r\nhas gone off, but he is left in a state of imbecility and melancholy.\r\nThey are going to carry him to Hanover, to see whether such a journey\r\nmay relieve him. The Queen accompanies him. If England should, by this\r\naccident, be reduced to inactivity, the southern countries of Europe may\r\nescape the present war. Upon the whole, the prospect for the present year,\r\nif no unforeseen accident happens, is, certain peace for the powers not\r\nalready engaged, a probability that Denmark will not become a principal,\r\nand a mere possibility that Sweden and Russia may be accommodated. The\r\ninterior disputes of Sweden are so exactly detailed in the Leyden gazette,\r\nthat I have nothing to add on that subject.\r\n\r\nThe revolution of this country has advanced thus far, without encountering\r\nanything which deserves to be called a difficulty. There have been riots\r\nin a few instances, in three or four different places, in which there\r\nmay have been a dozen or twenty lives lost. The exact truth is not to\r\nbe got at. A few days ago, a much more serious riot took place in this\r\ncity, in which it became necessary for the troops to engage in regular\r\naction with the mob, and probably about one hundred of the latter were\r\nkilled. Accounts vary from twenty to two hundred. They were the most\r\nabandoned banditti of Paris, and never was a riot more unprovoked and\r\nunpitied. They began, under a pretence that a paper manufacturer had\r\nproposed in an assembly to reduce their wages to fifteen sous a day.\r\nThey rifled his house, destroyed everything in his magazines and shops,\r\nand were only stopped in their career of mischief by the carnage above\r\nmentioned. Neither this nor any other of the riots, have had a professed\r\nconnection with the great national reformation going on. They are such as\r\nhave happened every year since I have been here, and as will continue to\r\nbe produced by common incidents. The States General were opened on the\r\n4th instant, by a speech from the throne, one by the Garde des Sceaux,\r\nand one from Mr. Neckar. I hope they will be printed in time to send you\r\nherewith: lest they should not, I will observe, that that of Mr. Neckar\r\nstated the real and ordinary deficit to be fifty-six millions, and that\r\nhe showed that this could be made up without a new tax, by economies\r\nand bonifications which he specified. Several articles of the latter\r\nare liable to the objection, that they are proposed on branches of the\r\nrevenue, of which the nation has demanded a suppression. He tripped too\r\nlightly over the great articles of constitutional reformation, these being\r\nnot as clearly enounced in this discourse as they were in his \"Rapport\r\nau roy,\" which I sent you some time ago. On the whole, his discourse\r\nhas not satisfied the patriotic party. It is now, for the first time,\r\nthat their revolution is likely to receive a serious check, and begins\r\nto wear a fearful appearance. The progress of light and liberality in\r\nthe order of the Noblesse, has equalled expectation in Paris only and\r\nits vicinities. The great mass of deputies of that order, which come\r\nfrom the country, show that the habits of tyranny over the people are\r\ndeeply rooted in them. They will consent, indeed, to equal taxation;\r\nbut five-sixths of that chamber are thought to be, decidedly, for voting\r\nby orders; so that, had this great preliminary question rested on this\r\nbody, which formed heretofore the sole hope, that hope would have been\r\ncompletely disappointed. Some aid, however, comes in from a quarter whence\r\nnone was expected. It was imagined the ecclesiastical elections would\r\nhave been generally in favor of the higher clergy; on the contrary, the\r\nlower clergy have obtained five-sixths of these deputations. These are\r\nthe sons of peasants, who have done all the drudgery of the service for\r\nten, twenty and thirty guineas a year, and whose oppressions and penury,\r\ncontrasted with the pride and luxury of the higher clergy, have rendered\r\nthem perfectly disposed to humble the latter. They have done it, in many\r\ninstances, with a boldness they were thought insusceptible of. Great hopes\r\nhave been formed, that these would concur with the Tiers Etat in voting\r\nby persons. In fact, about half of them seem as yet so disposed; but the\r\nbishops are intriguing, and drawing them over with the address which has\r\never marked ecclesiastical intrigue. The deputies of the Tiers Etat seem,\r\nalmost to a man, inflexibly determined against the vote by orders. This\r\nis the state of parties, as well as can be judged from conversation only,\r\nduring the fortnight they have been now together. But as no business\r\nhas been yet begun, no votes as yet taken, this calculation cannot be\r\nconsidered as sure. A middle proposition is talked of, to form the two\r\nprivileged orders into one chamber. It is thought more possible to bring\r\nthem into it than the Tiers Etat. Another proposition is, to distinguish\r\nquestions, referring those of certain descriptions to a vote by persons,\r\nothers to a vote by orders. This seems to admit of endless altercation,\r\nand the Tiers Etat manifest no respect for that, or any other modification\r\nwhatever. Were this single question accommodated, I am of opinion, there\r\nwould not occur the least difficulty in the great and essential points of\r\nconstitutional reformation. But on this preliminary question the parties\r\nare so irreconcilable, that it is impossible to foresee what issue it\r\nwill have. The Tiers Etat, as constituting the nation, may propose to\r\ndo the business of the nation, either with or without the minorities in\r\nthe Houses of Clergy and Nobles which side with them. In that case, if\r\nthe King should agree to it, the majorities in those two Houses would\r\nsecede, and might resist the tax gatherers. This would bring on a civil\r\nwar. On the other hand, the privileged orders, offering to submit to equal\r\ntaxation, may propose to the King to continue the government in its former\r\ntrain, resuming to himself the power of taxation. Here, the tax gatherers\r\nmight be resisted by the people. In fine, it is but too possible, that\r\nbetween parties so animated, the King may incline the balance as he\r\npleases. Happy that he is an honest, unambitious man, who desires neither\r\nmoney or power for himself; and that his most operative minister, though\r\nhe has appeared to trim a little, is still, in the main, a friend to\r\npublic liberty.\r\n\r\nI mentioned to you in a former letter, the construction which our bankers\r\nat Amsterdam had put on the resolution of Congress, appropriating the last\r\nDutch loan, by which the money for our captives would not be furnished\r\ntill the end of the year 1790. Orders from the board of treasury have now\r\nsettled this question. The interest of the next month is to be first paid,\r\nand after that, the money for the captives and foreign officers is to be\r\nfurnished, before any other payment of interest. This insures it when the\r\nnext February interest becomes payable. My representations to them, on\r\naccount of the contracts I had entered into for making the medals, have\r\nproduced from them the money of that object, which is lodged in the hands\r\nof Mr. Grand.\r\n\r\nMr. Neckar, in his discourse, proposes among his bonifications of revenue,\r\nthe suppressions of our two free ports of Bayonne and L'Orient, which,\r\nhe says, occasion a loss of six hundred thousand livres annually, to the\r\ncrown, by contraband. (The speech being not yet printed, I state this only\r\nas it struck my ear when he delivered it. If I have mistaken it, I beg you\r\nto receive this as my apology, and to consider what follows as written\r\non that idea only.) I have never been able to see that these free ports\r\nwere worth one copper to us. To Bayonne our trade never went, and it is\r\nleaving L'Orient. Besides, the right of entrepôt is a perfect substitute\r\nfor the right of free port. The latter is a little less troublesome only,\r\nto the merchants and captains. I should think, therefore, that a thing\r\nso useless to us and prejudicial to them might be relinquished by us, on\r\nthe common principles of friendship. I know the merchants of these ports\r\nwill make a clamor, because the franchise covers their contraband with all\r\nthe world. Has Monsieur de Moustier said anything to you on this subject?\r\nIt has never been mentioned to me. If not mentioned in either way, it is\r\nrather an indecent proceeding, considering that this right of free port is\r\nfounded in treaty. I shall ask of M. de Montmorin, on the first occasion,\r\nwhether he has communicated this to you through his ministry; and if he\r\nhas not, I will endeavor to notice the infraction to him in such a manner,\r\nas neither to reclaim nor abandon the right of free port, but leave our\r\ngovernment free to do either.\r\n\r\nThe gazettes of France and Leyden, as usual, will accompany this. I am in\r\nhourly expectation of receiving from you my leave of absence, and keep\r\nmy affairs so arranged, that I can leave Paris within eight days after\r\nreceiving the permission. I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the\r\nmost perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                                       Paris, May 10, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,--I am now to acknowledge the honor of your two letters of Nov. the\r\n27th and Feb. the 13th, both of which have come to hand since my last to\r\nyou of Dec. the 4th and 5th. The details you are so good as to give me on\r\nthe subject of the navigation of the waters of the Potomac and Ohio, are\r\nvery pleasing to me, as I consider the union of these two rivers, as among\r\nthe strongest links of connection between the eastern and western sides of\r\nour confederacy. It will, moreover, add to the commerce of Virginia, in\r\nparticular, all the upper parts of the Ohio and its waters. Another vast\r\nobject, and of much less difficulty, is to add, also, all the country on\r\nthe lakes and their waters. This would enlarge our field immensely, and\r\nwould certainly be effected by an union of the upper waters of the Ohio\r\nand lake Erie. The Big Beaver and Cayahoga offer the most direct line,\r\nand according to information I received from General Hand, and which\r\nI had the honor of writing you in the year 1783, the streams in that\r\nneighborhood head in lagoons, and the country is flat. With respect to\r\nthe doubts which you say are entertained by some, whether the upper waters\r\nof Potomac can be rendered capable of navigation on account of the falls\r\nand rugged banks, they are answered, by observing, that it is reduced to\r\na maxim, that whenever there is water enough to float a batteau, there\r\nmay be navigation for a batteau. Canals and locks may be necessary, and\r\nthey are expensive; but I hardly know what expense would be too great, for\r\nthe object in question. Probably, negotiations with the Indians, perhaps\r\neven settlement, must precede the execution of the Cayahoga canal. The\r\nStates of Maryland and Virginia should make a common object of it. The\r\nnavigation, again, between Elizabeth River and the Sound, is of vast\r\nimportance, and in my opinion, it is much better that these should be done\r\nat public than private expense.\r\n\r\nThough we have not heard of the actual opening of the new Congress, and\r\nconsequently, have not official information of your election as President\r\nof the United States, yet, as there never could be a doubt entertained of\r\nit, permit me to express here my felicitations, not to yourself, but to\r\nmy country. Nobody who has tried both public and private life, can doubt\r\nbut that you were much happier on the banks of the Potomac than you will\r\nbe at New York. But there was nobody so well qualified as yourself, to put\r\nour new machine into a regular course of action; nobody, the authority\r\nof whose name could have so effectually crushed opposition at home, and\r\nproduced respect abroad. I am sensible of the immensity of the sacrifice\r\non your part. Your measure of fame was full to the brim; and, therefore,\r\nyou have nothing to gain. But there are cases wherein it is a duty to\r\nrisk all against nothing, and I believe this was exactly the case. We may\r\npresume, too, according to every rule of probability, that after doing\r\na great deal of good, you will be found to have lost nothing but private\r\nrepose.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Mr. Jay, of the 19th of Nov., I asked a leave of absence\r\nto carry my children back to their own country, and to settle various\r\nmatters of a private nature, which were left unsettled, because I had\r\nno idea of being absent so long. I expected that letter would have been\r\nreceived in time to be decided on by the Government then existing. I know\r\nnow that it would arrive when there was no Congress, and consequently,\r\nthat it must have awaited your arrival at New York. I hope you found\r\nthe request not an unreasonable one. I am excessively anxious to receive\r\nthe permission without delay, that I may be able to get back before the\r\nwinter sets in. Nothing can be so dreadful to me, as to be shivering\r\nat sea for two or three months in a winter passage. Besides, there has\r\nnever been a moment at which the presence of a minister here could be so\r\nwell dispensed with, from certainty of no war this summer, and that the\r\ngovernment will be so totally absorbed in domestic arrangements, as to\r\nattend to nothing exterior. Mr. Jay will, of course, communicate to you\r\nsome ciphered letters lately written, and one of this date. My public\r\nletter to him contains all the interesting public details. I enclose with\r\nthe present, some extracts of a letter from Mr. Paine, which he desired\r\nme to communicate; your knowledge of the writer will justify my giving\r\nyou the trouble of these communications, which their interesting nature\r\nand his respectability, will jointly recommend to notice. I am in great\r\npain for the Marquis de La Fayette. His principles, you know, are clearly\r\nwith the people; but having been elected for the Noblesse of Auvergne,\r\nthey have laid him under express instructions, to vote for the decision\r\nby orders and not persons. This would ruin him with the Tiers Etat, and\r\nit is not possible he could continue long to give satisfaction to the\r\nNoblesse. I have not hesitated to press on him to burn his instructions,\r\nand follow his conscience as the only sure clue, which will eternally\r\nguide a man clear of all doubts and inconsistencies. If he cannot effect\r\na conciliatory plan, he will surely take his stand manfully at once, with\r\nthe Tiers Etat. He will in that case be what he pleases with them, and\r\nI am in hopes that base is now too solid to render it dangerous to be\r\nmounted on it. In hopes of being able in the course of the summer, to pay\r\nmy respects to you personally, in New York, I have the honor to be, with\r\nsentiments of the most perfect respect and attachment, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Extract of the letter from Thomas Paine, referred to in the preceding,\r\nto General Washington._]\r\n\r\n\"London, March the 12th, 1789. I do not think it is worth while for\r\nCongress to appoint any minister at this court. The greater distance\r\nCongress observes on this point, the better. It will be all money thrown\r\naway, to go to any expense about it, at least during the present reign. I\r\nknow the nation well, and the line of acquaintance I am in, enables me to\r\njudge better on this matter than any other American can judge, especially\r\nat a distance. I believe I am not so much in the good graces of the\r\nMarquis of Lansdowne as I used to be. I do not answer his purpose. He was\r\nalways talking of a sort of re-connection of England and America, and my\r\ncoldness and reserve on this subject checked communication. I believe he\r\nwould be a good minister for England, with respect to a better agreement\r\nwith France.\"\r\n\r\n(Same letter continued) \"April 10. The acts for regulating the trade with\r\nAmerica are to be continued as last year. A paper from the Privy Council\r\nrespecting the American fly, is before parliament. I had some conversation\r\nwith Sir Joseph Banks upon this subject, as he was the person whom the\r\nPrivy Council referred to. I told him that the Hessian fly attacked only\r\nthe green plant, and did not exist in the dry grain. He said, that with\r\nrespect to the Hessian fly, they had no apprehension, but it was the\r\nweavil they alluded to. I told him the weavil had always, more or less,\r\nbeen in the wheat countries of America, and that if the prohibition was\r\non that account, it was as necessary fifty or sixty years as now; that I\r\nbelieved it was only a political manœuvre of the ministry to please the\r\nlanded interest, as a balance for prohibiting the exportation of wool,\r\nto please the manufacturing interest. He did not reply, and as we are on\r\nvery sociable terms, I went farther, by saying, the English ought not to\r\ncomplain of the non-payment of debts from America, while they prohibit the\r\nmeans of payment. I suggest to you a thought on this subject. The debts\r\ndue before the war ought to be distinguished from the debts contracted\r\nsince, and all and every mode of payment and remittance under which\r\nthey might have been discharged at the time they were contracted, ought\r\nto accompany those debts so long as any of them shall continue unpaid,\r\nbecause the circumstances of payment became united with the debt, and\r\ncannot be separated by subsequent acts of one side only. If this was taken\r\nup in America, and insisted on as a right coëval with and inseparable from\r\nthose debts, it would force some of the restrictions here to give way.\r\nWhile writing this, I am informed that the minister has had a conference\r\nwith some of the American creditors, and proposed to them to assume the\r\ndebts, and give them ten shillings in the pound. The conjecture is, that\r\nhe means, when the new Congress is established, to demand the payment.\r\nIf you are writing to General Washington, it may not be amiss to mention\r\nthis, and if I hear further on this matter, I will inform you. But as,\r\nbeing a money matter, it cannot come forward but through parliament, there\r\nwill be notice given of the business. This would be a proper time to show,\r\nthat the British acts since the peace militate against the payment, by\r\nnarrowing the means by which those debts might have been paid when they\r\nwere contracted, and which ought to be considered as constituent parts of\r\nthe contract.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                       Paris, May 11, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--My last to you was of the 15th of March. I am now in hourly\r\nexpectation of receiving my leave of absence. The delay of it a little\r\nlonger, will endanger the throwing my return into the winter, the very\r\nidea of which is horror itself to me. I am in hopes this is the last\r\nletter I shall have the pleasure of writing to you, before my departure.\r\n\r\nThe madness of the King of England has gone off, but left him in a state\r\nof imbecility and melancholy. They talk of carrying him to Hanover. If\r\nthey do, it will be a proof he does not mend, and that they take that\r\nmeasure, to authorize them to establish a regency. But if he grows better,\r\nthey will perhaps keep him at home, to avoid the question, who shall be\r\nregent? As that country cannot be relied on in the present state of its\r\nexecutive, the King of Prussia has become more moderate; he throws cold\r\nwater on the fermentation he had excited in Poland. The King of Sweden\r\nwill act as nobody, not even himself, can foresee; because he acts from\r\nthe caprice of the moment, and because the discontents of his army and\r\nnobles may throw him under internal difficulties, while struggling with\r\nexternal ones. Denmark will probably only furnish its stipulated aid to\r\nRussia. France is fully occupied with internal arrangement. So that, on\r\nthe whole, the prospect of this summer is, that the war will continue\r\nbetween the powers actually engaged in the close of the last campaign,\r\nand extend to no others; certainly, it will not extend, this year, to the\r\nsouthern States of Europe. The revolution of France has gone on with the\r\nmost unexampled success, hitherto. There have been some mobs, occasioned\r\nby the want of bread, in different parts of the kingdom, in which there\r\nmay have been some lives lost; perhaps a dozen or twenty. These had no\r\nprofessed connection, _generally_, with the constitutional revolution.\r\nA more serious riot happened lately in Paris, in which about one hundred\r\nof the mob were killed. This execution has been universally approved, as\r\nthey seemed to have no view but mischief and plunder. But the meeting of\r\nthe States General presents serious difficulties, which it had been hoped\r\nthe progress of reason would have enabled them to get over. The nobility\r\nof and about Paris, have come over, as was expected, to the side of the\r\npeople, in the great question of voting by persons or orders. This had\r\ninduced a presumption that those of the country were making the same\r\nprogress, and these form the great mass of the deputies of that order.\r\nBut they are found to be where they were centuries ago, as to their\r\ndisposition to keep distinct from the people, and even to tyrannize over\r\nthem. They agree, indeed, to abandon their pecuniary privileges. The\r\nclergy seem, at present, much divided. Five-sixths of that representation\r\nconsists of the lower clergy, who, being the sons of the peasantry, are\r\nvery well with the Tiers Etat. But the Bishops are intriguing, and drawing\r\nthem over daily. The Tiers Etat is so firm to vote by persons or to go\r\nhome, that it is impossible to conjecture what will be the result. This is\r\nthe state of parties, as well as we can conjecture from the conversation\r\nof the members; for, as yet, no vote has been given which will enable us\r\nto calculate, on certain ground.\r\n\r\nHaving formerly written to you on the subject of our finances, I enclose\r\nyou now an abstract of a paper on that subject, which Gouverneur Morris\r\ncommunicated to me. You will be a better judge of its merit than I am. It\r\nseems to me worthy good attention.\r\n\r\nI have a box of books packed for you, which I shall carry to Havre, and\r\nsend by any ship bound to New York or Philadelphia. I have been so inexact\r\nas to take no list of them before nailing up the box. Be so good as to do\r\nthis, and I will take with me my bookseller's account, which will enable\r\nus to make a statement of them. They are chiefly Encyclopedies, from the\r\ntwenty-third to the thirtieth livraison. Paul Jones has desired me to\r\nsend to yourself and Colonel Carrington each, his bust. They are packed\r\ntogether in the same box. There are three other boxes, with two in each,\r\nfor other gentlemen. I shall send them all together, and take the liberty\r\nof addressing them to you. I rejoice extremely to hear you are elected, in\r\nspite of all cabals. I fear your post will not permit me to see you but\r\nin New York, and consequently but a short time only. I shall much regret\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nI am, with sentiments of sincere attachment and respect, dear Sir, your\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE MR. JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                       Paris, May 12, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,--I am this moment returned from Versailles, and it is the last\r\nmoment allowed me to write by this occasion. The Tiers Etat remain\r\nunshaken in their resolution to do no business with the other orders, but\r\nvoting by persons. The Nobles are equally determined, and by a majority\r\nof four-fifths or five-sixths to vote only by orders. Committees of\r\naccommodation indeed are appointed, but with little prospect of effect.\r\nAlready the ministry of the Nobles began to talk of abandoning their\r\nbody, and going to take their places among the Tiers. Perhaps they may\r\nbe followed by the timid part of their orders, and it might be hoped, by\r\na majority of the Clergy, which still remain undebauched by the bishops.\r\nThis would form a States General of the whole Tiers, a majority of the\r\nClergy, and a fraction of the Nobles. This may be considered, then, as\r\none of the possible issues this matter may take, should reconciliation be\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\nI am able to speak now more surely of the situation of the Emperor. His\r\ncomplaint is pulmonary. The spitting of blood is from the lungs. The\r\nhemorrhage which came on was critical, and relieved him for the moment;\r\nbut the relief was momentary only. There is little expectation he can\r\nlast long. The King of England's voyage to Hanover is spoken of more\r\ndoubtfully. This would be an indication that his complaint is better, or,\r\nat least, not worse. I find, on receiving Mr. Neckar's discourse in print,\r\nthat he has not proposed in direct terms to put down our free ports. The\r\nexpression is, \"on se borne en ce moment a vous faire observer,\" &c.,\r\n&c. I spoke on the subject to M. de Montmorin to-day, and he says they\r\nmeant and mean to confer with me on it before my departure. I spoke to\r\nhim also to bring Schweighauser and De Bree's affair to a conclusion;\r\nand to Mr. Rayneval on the same subject. They told me they had just\r\nreceived a letter from the Count de La Luzerne, justifying the detention\r\nof our stores; that they were so much dissatisfied with the principles\r\nhe advanced, that they should take upon themselves to combat and protest\r\nagainst them, and to insist on a clear establishment of the rule that the\r\nproperty of one sovereign within the dominions of another, is not liable\r\nto the territorial jurisdiction. They have accordingly charged one of\r\ntheir ablest counsels with the preparation of a memoir to establish this\r\npoint. I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem\r\nand respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DE PONTIÈRE.\r\n\r\n                                                       Paris, May 17, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,--I am honored with your letter of the 6th instant, and am sincerely\r\nsorry that you should experience inconveniences for the want of arrearages\r\ndue to you from the United States. I have never ceased to take every\r\nmeasure which could promise to procure to the foreign officers the payment\r\nof these arrears. At present, the matter stands thus: Congress have\r\nagreed to borrow a sum of money in Holland, to enable them to pay the\r\nindividual demands in Europe. They have given orders that these arrearages\r\nshall be paid out of this money, when borrowed, and certain bankers in\r\nAmsterdam are charged to borrow the money. I am myself of opinion, they\r\nwill certainly procure the money in the course of the present year; but\r\nit is not for me to affirm this, nor to make any engagement. The moment\r\nthe money is ready, it shall be made known to Colonel Gourion, who, at\r\nthe desire of many of the officers, has undertaken to communicate with\r\nme on the subject, and to inform them, from time to time, of the progress\r\nof this business. He will readily answer your letters on this subject. I\r\ndepart in a few days for America, but shall leave such instructions here,\r\nas that this matter will suffer no delay on that account.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. VAUGHAN.\r\n\r\n                                                       Paris, May 17, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I am to acknowledge, all together, the receipt of your favors\r\nof March the 17th, 26th, and May the 7th, and to return you abundant\r\nthanks for your attention to the article of dry rice, and the parcel of\r\nseeds you sent me. This is interesting, because, even should it not take\r\nplace of the wet rice, in South Carolina, it will enable us to cultivate\r\nthis grain in Virginia, where we have not lands disposed for the wet rice.\r\nThe collection of the works of Monsieur de Poivre has not, as I believe,\r\nbeen ever published. It could hardly have escaped my knowledge if they\r\nhad been ever announced. The French translation of the book on trade,\r\nhas not yet come to my hands. Whenever I receive the copies they shall\r\nbe distributed, and principally among the members of the Etats Generaux.\r\nI doubt whether, at this session, they will take up the subject of\r\ncommerce. Whenever they do, they will find better principles nowhere than\r\nin that book. I spoke with Mr. Stewart yesterday on the subject of the\r\ndistribution, and if I should be gone before the books come to hand, he\r\nwill execute the commission. Your nation is very far from the liberality\r\nthat treatise inculcates. The proposed regulation on the subject of our\r\nwheat, is one proof. The prohibition of it in England would, of itself,\r\nbe of no great moment, because I do not know that it is much sent there.\r\nBut it is the publishing a libel on our wheat, sanctioned with the name of\r\nparliament, and which can have no object but to do us injury, by spreading\r\na groundless alarm in those countries of Europe where our wheat is\r\nconstantly and kindly received. It is a mere assassination. If the insect\r\nthey pretend to fear, be the Hessian fly, it never existed in the grain.\r\nIf it be the weavil, our grain always had that; and the experience of a\r\ncentury has proved that either the climate of England is not warm enough\r\nto hatch the egg and continue the race, or that some other unknown cause\r\nprevents any evil from it. How different from this spirit, my dear Sir,\r\nhas been your readiness to help us to the dry rice, to communicate to us\r\nthe bread tree, &c. Will any of our climates admit the cultivation of the\r\nlatter? I am too little acquainted with it, to judge. I learn that your\r\nnewspapers speak of the death of Ledyard, at Grand Cairo. I am anxious\r\nto know whether there be foundation for this. I have not yet had time to\r\ntry the execution of the wood hygrometer proposed by Dr. Franklin. Though\r\nI have most of the articles ready made, I doubt now whether I shall be\r\nable to do it before my departure for America, the permission for which,\r\nI expect every hour; and I shall go off the instant I receive it. While\r\nthere, I shall have the pleasure of seeing your father and friends. I\r\nexpect to return in the fall. In the meantime I have the honor to be,\r\nwith very great esteem and respect, dear Sir, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS PAINE.\r\n\r\n                                                       Paris, May 19, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Your favors of February the 16th to April the 13th, and of May\r\nthe 3d and 10th, are received; and the two last are sent to Mr. Leroy,\r\nwho will communicate them to the Academy.\r\n\r\nYou know that the States General have met, and probably have seen the\r\nspeeches at the opening of them. The three orders sit in distinct\r\nchambers. The great question, whether they shall vote by orders or\r\npersons can never be surmounted amicably. It has not yet been proposed\r\nin form; but the votes which have been taken on the outworks of that\r\nquestion show that the Tiers Etat are unanimous, a good majority of the\r\nClergy (consisting of the Curés) disposed to side with the Tiers Etat,\r\nand in the chamber of the Noblesse, there are only fifty-four in that\r\nsentiment, against one hundred and ninety, who are for voting by orders.\r\nCommittees to find means of conciliation are appointed by each chamber;\r\nbut conciliation is impossible. Some think the Nobles could be induced\r\nto unite themselves with the _higher Clergy_ into one House, the lower\r\nClergy and Tiers Etat forming another. But the Tiers Etat are immovable.\r\nThey are not only firm, but a little disdainful. The question is, what\r\nwill ensue? One idea is to separate, in order to consult again their\r\nconstituents, and to take new instructions. This would be doing nothing,\r\nfor the same instructions would be repeated; and what, in the meantime, is\r\nto become of a government, absolutely without money, and which cannot be\r\nkept in motion with less than a million of livres a day? The more probable\r\nexpectation is as follows. As soon as it shall become evident that no\r\namicable determination of the manner of voting can take place, the Tiers\r\nEtat will send an invitation to the two other orders to come and take\r\ntheir places in the common chamber. A majority of the Clergy will go, and\r\nthe minority of the Noblesse. The chamber thus composed will declare that\r\nthe States General are constituted, will notify it to the King, and that\r\nthey are ready to proceed to business. If the King refuses to do business\r\nwith them, and adheres to the Nobles, the common chamber will declare all\r\ntaxes at an end, will form a declaration of rights, and do such other acts\r\nas circumstances will permit, and go home. The tax-gatherers will then\r\nbe resisted, and it may well be doubted whether the soldiery and their\r\nofficers will not divide, as the Tiers Etat and Nobles. But it is more\r\nlikely that the King will agree to do business with the States General,\r\nso constituted, professing that the necessities of the moment force\r\nthis, and that he means to negotiate (as they go along) a reconciliation\r\nbetween the seceding members and those which remain. If the matter takes\r\nthis turn, there may be small troubles and ebullitions excited by the\r\nseceding Noblesse and higher Clergy; but no serious difficulty can arise.\r\nM. de Lamoignon, the Garde des Sceaux of the last year, has shot himself.\r\nThe Emperor's complaint is pulmonary and incurable. The Grand Seignior\r\nis dead; his successor, young and warlike. I congratulate you sincerely\r\non the success of your bridge. I was sure of it before from theory; yet\r\none likes to be assured from practice also. I am anxious to see how Mr.\r\nRumsey's experiment succeeds.\r\n\r\n_May_ the 21st. I have this moment received a letter from Ledyard, dated\r\nCairo, November the 15th. He therein says, \"I am doing up my baggage,\r\nand most curious baggage it is, and I leave Cairo in two or three days.\r\nI travel from hence southwest, about three hundred leagues, to a black\r\nKing; there my present conductors leave me to my fate. Beyond, I suppose,\r\nI go alone. I expect to hit the continent across, between the parallels of\r\ntwelve and twenty degrees north latitude. I shall, if possible, write you\r\nfrom the kingdom of this black gentleman.\" This seems to contradict the\r\nstory of his having died at Cairo in January, as he was then, probably,\r\nin the interior parts of Africa. If Sir Joseph Banks has no news from him\r\nlater than the letter of September, it may do him pleasure, if you will\r\ncommunicate the above. If he or any other person knows whether there is\r\nany foundation for the story of his death, I will thank you to inform me\r\nof it. My letter being to go off to-morrow, I shall only add assurances of\r\nthe esteem and respect with which I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR PRICE.\r\n\r\n                                                       Paris, May 19, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Your favor of the 4th instant is duly received. I am in hourly\r\nexpectation of receiving letters permitting me to go to America for a few\r\nmonths, and shall leave Paris within a very few days after I shall have\r\nreceived them. As this is probably the last letter I can have the honor\r\nof writing you before my return, I will do myself the pleasure of putting\r\nyou in possession of the state of things here at this moment, as it may\r\nenable you better to decide between truth and falsehood for some time to\r\ncome. You already know that the States General are met, and have seen the\r\nspeeches of the King, the Garde des Sceaux, and of Mr. Neckar. The three\r\norders as yet, set in different chambers. The great parliamentary question\r\nwhether they shall vote by orders or persons is undecided. It has not\r\nyet been formally proposed, but the votes already given in the separate\r\nchambers on the outworks of that question, show that the Tiers Etat are\r\nunanimous for voting by persons. A good majority of the Clergy of the same\r\ndisposition, and only fifty-four of the Noblesse against one hundred and\r\nninety of the same body, who are for voting by orders. The chambers have\r\nappointed committees to confer together on the means of conciliation,\r\nbut this is mere form, conciliation being impracticable. The Noblesse, as\r\nsome think, would be induced to unite themselves into one house, with the\r\nhigher Clergy, the lower Clergy and Tiers forming another. But the Tiers\r\nare firm, and will agree to no modification. They are disposed to reduce\r\nthe State to one order as much as possible. As we are always disposed\r\nto conjecture on the future, it is natural to form conjectures as to the\r\nissue from the present difficulty. One idea is, that they will separate\r\nto consult their constituents. I think they will not do this, because\r\nthey know their constituents will repeat the same instructions. And what\r\nin the meantime is to become of a government which cannot keep in motion\r\nwith less than a million of livres a day? A more probable conjecture is,\r\nthat when it shall be manifest that conciliation is impracticable, the\r\nTiers will invite the other orders to come and take their places in the\r\ncommon chamber. The majority of the Clergy, (to wit, the curés, and the\r\nminority of the Noblesse,) will accept the invitation. The chamber thus\r\ncomposed, will declare that the States General are now constituted, will\r\nnotify it to the King, and prepare to proceed to business. If he refuses\r\nto acknowledge them, and adheres to the principles of the Noblesse,\r\nthey will suspend all taxes, form a declaration of rights, and do such\r\nother acts as circumstances will admit, and go home. The tax-gatherers\r\nwill be resisted, and perhaps the soldiery take side with the Tiers, and\r\ntheir officers with the Noblesse. But I rather suppose the King will do\r\nbusiness with the States so constituted, negotiating at the same time as\r\nthey go along, a reconciliation with the seceding members. The latter\r\nmay in that case excite small and partial troubles, but cannot make a\r\nserious resistance. It is very important that the lower Clergy side with\r\nthe Tiers. They are the effective part of that order, while the bishops\r\nand archbishops are held in detestation. But you are to keep in mind that\r\nthese are conjectures, and you know how small a circumstance may give\r\na totally different turn from what has been plausibly conjectured. My\r\nhope is that the mass of the Bourgeoisie is too well in motion, and too\r\nwell-informed to be resisted or misled, and ultimately that this great\r\ncountry will obtain a good constitution, and show the rest of Europe\r\nthat reformation in government follows reformation in opinion. I am, with\r\nsentiments of the most perfect esteem and attachment, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DE CREVECOEUR.\r\n\r\n                                                       Paris, May 20, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I am now to acknowledge the receipt of your several letters\r\nof October 20th, November 20th, and January 2d, and to thank you for the\r\npamphlets you have been so kind as to send me. A conveyance by the way\r\nof London enables me to write the present, for I never think of writing\r\n_news_ by the circumnavigation of the Bordeaux packet. You know that\r\nyour States General are met, and you have seen the speeches of the King\r\nand his ministers at the opening of it, for I take for granted, M. de\r\nMontmorin has sent them to M. de Moustier, as I have done to Mr. Jay. I\r\nwas present at that august ceremony. Had it been enlightened with lamps\r\nand chandeliers, it would have been almost as brilliant as the opera.\r\nTill now your affairs have gone on with a smoothness and rapidity which\r\nhas been never before seen. At this moment, however, they are at a dead\r\nstand. The great preliminary question, whether they shall vote by orders\r\nor persons, seems to threaten a scission. They have not yet ventured to\r\npresent the question in form, but the votes which have been given by the\r\nseparate chambers on the outworks of that question, enables us to see\r\npretty clearly the strength of the two parties. For voting by persons are\r\n1, the Tiers Etat, unanimous; 2, a good majority of the Clergy, consisting\r\nof the curés; 3, fifty-four members of the Noblesse. For voting by orders\r\nare 1, the residue of the Nobles being about 190; 2, a minority in the\r\nClergy, consisting of the bishops and archbishops, &c. All the world\r\nis conjecturing how they are to get over the difficulty. Abundance are\r\naffrighted, and think all is lost, and the nation in despair at this\r\nunsuccessful effort, will consign itself to tenfold despotism. This is\r\nrank cowardice. Others propose that the members shall go back to ask new\r\ninstructions from their constituents. This would be useless, because they\r\nknow that the same instructions would be repeated, and who can say what\r\nnew event, internal or external, might shuffle this glorious game out of\r\ntheir hands? Another hypothesis, which I shall develop, because I like it,\r\nand wish it, and hope it, is, that as soon as it shall be manifest that\r\nthe committees of conciliation, now appointed by the three chambers, shall\r\nbe able to agree in nothing, the Tiers will invite the other two orders to\r\ncome and take their seats in the common chamber. A majority of the Clergy\r\nwill come, and the minority of the Nobles. The chamber thus composed, will\r\ndeclare that the States General are now constituted, will notify it to the\r\nKing, and propose to do business. It may be hoped he will accede to their\r\nproposition, justifying it by the necessity of the moment, and negotiating\r\nas they go along, the return of the other members of the Noblesse and\r\nClergy. If he should, on the contrary, refuse to receive them as the\r\nStates General, and adheres to the principles of the Noblesse, it may\r\npossibly happen that the Tiers will declare all taxes discontinued, form a\r\ndeclaration of rights, and do such other acts as circumstances will admit,\r\nand return every man to his tent. The tax-gatherers might be resisted, and\r\nthe body of the army found to be disposed differently from their officers.\r\nAll this will be avoided by admitting this composition of the chamber to\r\nbe the States General, and pursuing modes of conciliation. These indeed\r\nwill be difficult for the orders, as the Tiers seem determined to break\r\ndown all the barriers of the separation of the several orders, and to\r\nhave in future but one. I would have put off writing to you a few days\r\nlonger, in hopes of informing you of the unravelling of this knot, but\r\nI am in hourly expectation of receiving my leave of absence, and am so\r\nprepared for my departure, that a very few days will enable me to set\r\nout for America, where I shall have the pleasure of relating to you more\r\naccurately the state of things here, of delivering you letters from your\r\nsons, and of assuring you in person of those sentiments of esteem and\r\nrespect, with which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your most obedient\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. I have sent to M. le Comte de Moustier a list of the Deputies of\r\nthe States.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\n                                                       Paris, June 3, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Revolving further in my mind the idea started yesterday of\r\nthe King's coming forward in a _seance royale_, and offering a charter\r\ncontaining all the good in which all the parties agree, I like it more\r\nand more. I have ventured to sketch such a charter merely to convey my\r\nidea, which I now enclose to you, as I do also to M. de St. Etienne. I\r\nwrite him a letter of apology for my meddling in a business where I know\r\nso little and you and he so much. I have thought it better to possess him\r\nimmediately of the paper, because he may at the conference of to-day sound\r\nthe minds of the conferees. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DE ST. ETIENNE.\r\n\r\n                                                       Paris, June 3, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,--After you quitted us yesterday evening, we continued our\r\nconversation (Monsieur de La Fayette, Mr. Short and myself) on the subject\r\nof the difficulties which environ you. The desirable object being, to\r\nsecure the good which the King has offered, and to avoid the ill which\r\nseems to threaten, an idea was suggested, which appearing to make an\r\nimpression on Monsieur de La Fayette, I was encouraged to pursue it on\r\nmy return to Paris, to put it into form, and now to send it to you and\r\nhim. It is this; that the King, in a _seance royale_ should come forward\r\nwith a Charter of Rights in his hand, to be signed by himself and by\r\nevery member of the three orders. This charter to contain the five great\r\npoints which the Resultat of December offered, on the part of the King,\r\nthe abolition of pecuniary privileges offered by the privileged orders,\r\nand the adoption of the national debt, and a grant of the sum of money\r\nasked from the nation. This last will be a cheap price for the preceding\r\narticles; and let the same act declare your immediate separation till the\r\nnext anniversary meeting. You will carry back to your constituents more\r\ngood than ever was effected before without violence, and you will stop\r\nexactly at the point where violence would otherwise begin. Time will be\r\ngained, the public mind will continue to ripen and to be informed, a basis\r\nof support may be prepared with the people themselves, and expedients\r\noccur for gaining still something further at your next meeting, and\r\nfor stopping again at the point of force. I have ventured to send to\r\nyourself and Monsieur de La Fayette a sketch of my ideas of what this\r\nact might contain, without endangering any dispute. But it is offered\r\nmerely as a canvas for you to work on, if it be fit to work on at all. I\r\nknow too little of the subject, and you know too much of it, to justify\r\nme in offering anything but a hint. I have done it, too, in a hurry;\r\ninsomuch, that since committing it to writing, it occurs to me that the\r\nfifth article may give alarm; that it is in a good degree included in the\r\nfourth, and is, therefore, useless. But after all, what excuse can I make,\r\nSir, for this presumption. I have none but an unmeasurable love for your\r\nnation, and a painful anxiety lest despotism, after an unaccepted offer\r\nto bind its own hands, should seize you again with tenfold fury. Permit\r\nme to add to these, very sincere assurances of the sentiments of esteem\r\nand respect, with which I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient,\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n[The annexed is the Charter accompanying the two preceding letters.]\r\n\r\n_A Charter of Rights, solemnly established by the King and Nation_\r\n\r\n1. The States General shall assemble, uncalled, on the first day of\r\nNovember, annually, and shall remain together so long as they shall\r\nsee cause. They shall regulate their own elections and proceedings, and\r\nuntil they shall ordain otherwise, their elections shall be in the forms\r\nobserved in the present year, and shall be triennial.\r\n\r\n2. The States General alone shall levy money on the nation, and shall\r\nappropriate it.\r\n\r\n3. Laws shall be made by the States General only, with the consent of the\r\nKing.\r\n\r\n4. No person shall be restrained of his liberty, but by regular process\r\nfrom a court of justice, authorized by a general law. (Except that a Noble\r\nmay be imprisoned by order of a court of justice, on the prayer of twelve\r\nof his nearest relations.) On complaint of an unlawful imprisonment, to\r\nany judge whatever, he shall have the prisoner immediately brought before\r\nhim, and shall discharge him, if his imprisonment be unlawful. The officer\r\nin whose custody the prisoner is, shall obey the orders of the judge; and\r\nboth judge and officer shall be responsible, civilly and criminally, for\r\na failure of duty herein.\r\n\r\n5. The military shall be subordinate to the civil authority.\r\n\r\n6. Printers shall be liable to legal prosecution for printing and\r\npublishing false facts, injurious to the party prosecuting; but they shall\r\nbe under no other restraint.\r\n\r\n7. All pecuniary privileges and exemptions, enjoyed by any description of\r\npersons, are abolished.\r\n\r\n8. All debts already contracted by the King, are hereby made the debts\r\nof the nation; and the faith thereof is pledged for their payment in due\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n9. Eighty millions of livres are now granted to the King, to be raised by\r\nloan, and reimbursed by the nation; and the taxes heretofore paid, shall\r\ncontinue to be paid to the end of the present year, and no longer.\r\n\r\n10. The States General shall now separate, and meet again on the 1st day\r\nof November next.\r\n\r\nDone, on behalf of the whole nation, by the King and their representatives\r\nin the States General, at Versailles, this ---- day of June, 1789.\r\n\r\nSigned by the King, and by every member individually, and in his presence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\n                                                      Paris, June 12, 1789.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir,--As I may not be able to get at you, at Versailles, I write\r\nthis to deliver it myself at your door. With respect to the utility, or\r\ninutility of your minority's joining the Commons, I am unable to form an\r\nopinion for myself. I know too little of the subject to see what may be\r\nits consequences.\r\n\r\nI never knew an instance of the English parliament's undertaking to\r\nrelieve the poor, by a distribution of bread in time of scarcity. In fact,\r\nthe English commerce is so extensive and so active, that though bread may\r\nbe a little more or less plenty, there can never be an absolute failure.\r\nThis island is so narrow, that corn can be readily carried from the sea\r\nports to its interior parts. But were an absolute want to happen, and\r\nwere the parliament to undertake a distribution of corn, I think, that\r\naccording to the principles of their government, they would only vote a\r\nsum of money, and address the King to employ it for the best. The business\r\nis, in its nature, executive, and would require too great a variety of\r\ndetail to be managed by an act of parliament. However, I repeat it, that\r\nI never heard or read of an instance of the parliament's interfering to\r\ngive bread. If I see you at Versailles to-day, I can be more particular.\r\n\r\nI am with great sincerity, my dear Sir, your affectionate friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                      Paris, June 17, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,--I had the honor of addressing you on the 9th and 12th of May, by\r\nthe way of London. This goes through the same channel to the care of Mr.\r\nTrumbull. Having received no letter from you of later date than the 25th\r\nof November, I am apprehensive that there may have been miscarriages,\r\nand the more so, as I learn, through another channel, that you have\r\nparticularly answered mine of November the 19th.\r\n\r\nThe death of the Grand Seignior, which has happened, renders the\r\ncontinuance of the war more probable, as it has brought to the throne\r\na successor of a more active and ardent temper, and who means to put\r\nhimself at the head of his armies. He has declared the Captain Pacha\r\nhis Generalissimo. The prospects for Russia, on the other hand, are\r\nless encouraging. Her principal ally, the Emperor, is at death's door,\r\nblazing up a little indeed, from time to time, like an expiring taper, but\r\ncertainly to extinguish soon. Denmark too, is likely to be restrained by\r\nthe threats of England and Prussia, from contributing even her stipulated\r\nnaval succors. It is some time since I have been able to obtain any\r\naccount of the King of England, on which I can rely with confidence. His\r\nmelancholy continues, and to such a degree, as to render him absolutely\r\nindifferent to everything that passes, so that he seems willing to let his\r\nministers do everything they please, provided they will let him alone.\r\nWhen forced to speak, his comprehension seems better than it was in the\r\nfirst moments after his phrensy went off. His health is bad; he does not\r\ngo into public at all, and very few are admitted to see him. This is his\r\npresent state, according to the best accounts I have been able to get\r\nlately. His ministers dictate boldly in the north, because they know it\r\nis impossible they should be engaged in the war, while this country is so\r\ncompletely palsied.\r\n\r\nYou will have seen, by my former letters, that the question, whether the\r\nStates General should vote by persons or by orders, had stopped their\r\nproceedings in the very first instances in which it could occur, that\r\nis, as to the verification of their powers, and that they had appointed\r\ncommittees to try if there were any means of accommodation. These could\r\ndo nothing. The King then proposed that they should appoint others, to\r\nmeet persons whom he should name, on the same subject. These conferences\r\nalso proved ineffectual. He then proposed a specific mode of verifying.\r\nThe Clergy accepted it unconditionally. The Noblesse, with such conditions\r\nand modifications, as did away their acceptance altogether. The Commons,\r\nconsidering this as a refusal, came to the resolution of the 10th instant,\r\n(which I have the honor to send you,) inviting the two other orders\r\nto come and take their places in the common room, and notifying that\r\nthey should proceed to the verification of powers, and to the affairs\r\nof the nation, either with or without them. The Clergy have, as yet,\r\ngiven no answer. A few of their members have accepted the invitation\r\nof the Commons, and have presented themselves in their room, to have\r\ntheir powers verified; but how many it will detach, in the whole, from\r\nthat body, cannot be known till an answer be decided on. The Noblesse\r\nadhered to their former resolutions, and even the minority, well disposed\r\nto the Commons, thought they could do more good in their own chamber,\r\nby endeavoring to increase their numbers and fettering the measures of\r\nthe majority, than by joining the Commons. An intrigue was set on foot\r\nbetween the loaders of the majority in that House, the Queen and Princes.\r\nThey persuaded the King to go for some time to Marly; he went. On the\r\nsame day, the leaders moved in the chamber of Nobles, that they should\r\naddress the King, to declare his own sentiments on the great question\r\nbetween the orders. It was intended that this address should be delivered\r\nto him at Marly, where, separated from his ministers, and surrounded by\r\nthe Queen and Princes, he might be surprised into a declaration for the\r\nNobles. The motion was lost, however, by a very great majority, that\r\nchamber being not yet quite ripe for throwing themselves into the arms\r\nof despotism. Neckar and Montmorin who had discovered this intrigue, had\r\nwarned some of the minority to defeat it, or they could not answer for\r\nwhat would happen. These two and St. Priest, are the only members of the\r\nCouncil in favor of the Commons. Luzerne, Puy-Segur and the others, are\r\nhigh aristocrats. The Commons having verified their powers, a motion was\r\nmade the day before yesterday, to declare themselves constituted, and to\r\nproceed to business. I left them at two o'clock yesterday; the debates not\r\nthen finished. They differed only about forms of expression, but agreed\r\nin the substance, and probably decided yesterday, or will decide to-day.\r\nTheir next move, I fancy, will be to suppress all taxes, and instantly\r\nre-establish them till the end of their session, in order to prevent a\r\npremature dissolution; and then, they will go to work on a declaration\r\nof rights and a constitution. The Noblesse, I suppose, will be employed\r\naltogether in counter operations; the Clergy, that is to say, the higher\r\nClergy, and such of the Curés as they can bring over to their side, will\r\nbe waiting and watching, merely to keep themselves in their saddles. Their\r\ndeportment, hitherto, is that of meekness and cunning. The fate of the\r\nnation depends on the conduct of the King and his ministers. Were they to\r\nside openly with the Commons, the revolution would be completed without\r\na convulsion, by the establishment of a constitution, tolerably free,\r\nand in which the distinction of Noble and Commoner would be suppressed.\r\nBut this is scarcely possible. The King is honest, and wishes the good\r\nof his people; but the expediency of an hereditary aristocracy is too\r\ndifficult a question for him. On the contrary, his prejudices, his habits\r\nand his connections, decide him in his heart to support it. Should they\r\ndecide openly for the Noblesse, the Commons, after suppressing taxes,\r\nand finishing their declaration of rights, would probably go home;\r\na bankruptcy takes place in the instant. Mr. Neckar must go out, a\r\nresistance to the tax-gatherers follows, and probably a civil war. These\r\nconsequences are too evident and violent, to render this issue likely.\r\nThough the Queen and Princes are infatuated enough to hazard it, the party\r\nin the ministry would not. Something, therefore, like what I hinted in my\r\nletter of May the 12th, is still the most likely to take place. While the\r\nCommons, either with or without their friends of the other two Houses,\r\nshall be employed in framing a constitution, perhaps the government may\r\nset the other two Houses to work on the same subject; and when the three\r\nschemes shall be ready, joint committees may be negotiated, to compare\r\nthem together, to see in what parts they agree; and probably they will\r\nagree in all, except the organization of the future States General. As to\r\nthis, it may be endeavored, by the aid of wheedling and intimidation, to\r\ninduce the two privileged chambers to melt themselves into one, and the\r\nCommons, instead of one, to agree to two Houses of legislation. I see no\r\nother middle ground to which they can be brought.\r\n\r\nIt is a tremendous cloud, indeed, which hovers over this nation, and he\r\nat the helm has neither the courage nor the skill necessary to weather\r\nit. Eloquence in a high degree, knowledge in matters of account and order,\r\nare distinguishing traits in his character. Ambition is his first passion,\r\nvirtue his second. He has not discovered that sublime truth, that a bold,\r\nunequivocal virtue is the best handmaid even to ambition, and would carry\r\nhim further, in the end, than the temporising, wavering policy he pursues.\r\nHis judgment is not of the first order, scarcely even of the second; his\r\nresolution frail; and, upon the whole, it is rare to meet an instance of\r\na person so much below the reputation he has obtained. As this character,\r\nby the post and times in which providence has placed it, is important\r\nto be known, I send it to you as drawn by a person of my acquaintance,\r\nwho knows him well. He is not, indeed, his friend, and allowance must,\r\ntherefore, be made for the high coloring. But this being abated, the\r\nfacts and groundwork of the drawing are just. If the Tiers separate, he\r\ngoes at the same time; if they stay together, and succeed in establishing\r\na constitution to their mind, as soon as that is placed in safety, they\r\nwill abandon him to the mercy of the court, unless he can recover the\r\nconfidence which he has lost at present, and which, indeed, seems to be\r\nirrecoverable.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of St. Domingo, without the permission of the Government,\r\nhave chosen and sent deputies to the States General. The question of\r\ntheir admission is to be discussed by the States. In the meantime, the\r\nGovernment had promised them an Assembly in their own island, in the\r\ncourse of the present year. The death of the Dauphin, so long expected,\r\nhas at length happened. Montmorin told Ternant the other day, that de\r\nMoustier had now asked a congé, which would be sent him immediately. So\r\nthat unless a change of ministry should happen, he will, probably, be\r\notherwise disposed of. The gazettes of France and Leyden accompany this.\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. June 18. The motion under debate with the Commons, for constituting\r\ntheir Assembly, passed yesterday by a majority of four hundred and odd,\r\nagainst eighty odd. The latter were for it in substance, but wished some\r\nparticular amendment. They proceeded instantly to the subject of taxation.\r\nA member, who called on me this moment, gave me a state of the proceedings\r\nof yesterday, from memory, which I enclose you. He left the House a little\r\nbefore the question was put, because he saw there was no doubt of its\r\npassing, and his brother, who remained till the decision, informed him of\r\nit. So that we may expect, perhaps, in the course of to-morrow, to see\r\nwhether the government will interpose with a bold hand, or will begin a\r\nnegotiation. But in the meantime, this letter must go off. I will find\r\nsome other opportunity, however, of informing you of the issue.\r\n\r\n[_Character of Mr. Neckar, accompanying the preceding letter._]\r\n\r\nNature bestowed on Mr. Neckar an ardent passion for glory, without, at the\r\nsame time, granting him those qualities required for its pursuit by direct\r\nmeans. The union of a fruitful imagination, with a limited talent, with\r\nwhich she has endowed him, is always incompatible with those faculties of\r\nthe mind which qualify their possessor to penetrate, to combine, and to\r\ncomprehend all the relations of objects.\r\n\r\nHe had probably learned in Geneva, his native country, the influence which\r\nriches exercise on the success of ambition, without having recourse to\r\nthe school of Paris, where he arrived about the twenty-eighth year of\r\nhis age. A personal affair with his brother, in which the chiefs of the\r\nrepublic conducted themselves unjustly towards him, the circumstances of\r\nwhich, moreover, exposed him to ridicule, determined him to forsake his\r\ncountry. On taking his leave, he assured his mother that he would make\r\na great fortune at Paris. On his arrival, he engaged himself as clerk,\r\nat a salary of six hundred livres, with the banker Thelusson, a man of\r\nextreme harshness in his intercourse with his dependents. The same cause\r\nwhich obliged other clerks to abandon the service of Thelusson, determined\r\nNeckar to continue in it. By submitting to the brutality of his master\r\nwith a servile resignation, whilst, at the same time, he devoted the\r\nmost unremitting attention to his business, he recommended himself to his\r\nconfidence, and was taken into partnership. Ordinary abilities only, were\r\nrequisite to avail him of the multitude of favorable circumstances, which,\r\nbefore he entered into the administration, built up a fortune of six\r\nmillions of livres. He owed much of his good fortune to his connections\r\nwith the Abbé Terrai, of whose ignorance he did not scruple to profit.\r\nHis riches, his profession, his table, and a virtuous, reasonable and\r\nwell-informed wife, procured him the acquaintance of many persons of\r\ndistinction, among whom were many men of letters, who celebrated his\r\nknowledge and wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe wise and just principles by which Turgot aimed to correct the\r\nabuses of the administration, not having been received with favor, he\r\nseized the occasion to flatter ignorance and malignity, by publishing\r\nhis work against the freedom of the corn trade. He had published, two\r\nyears before, an eulogy on Colbert. Both these productions exhibited the\r\nlimited capacity of a banker, and, in no degree, the enlarged views of a\r\nstatesman. Not at all delicate in the choice of his means, he succeeded\r\nto his wish in his object, which was the establishing himself in public\r\nopinion. Elevated by a secret cabal, to the direction of the finances,\r\nhe began by refusing the salaries of his office. He affected a spirit\r\nof economy and austerity, which imposed even on foreign nations, and\r\nshowed the possibility of making war without laying new taxes. Such, at\r\nleast, was his boast; but, in reality, they have been increased under his\r\nadministration, about twenty millions, partly by a secret augmentation of\r\nthe _bailles_ and of the poll-tax, partly by some versifications of the\r\n_twentieths_, and partly by the natural progression, which is tested by\r\nthe amount of taxes on consumption, the necessary result of the successive\r\nincrease of population, of riches, and of expensive tastes.\r\n\r\nAll these circumstances reared for him an astonishing reputation, which\r\nhis fall has consecrated. People will not reflect, that, in the short\r\nperiod of his ministry, he had more than doubled his fortune. Not that he\r\nhad peculated on the public treasury; his good sense and pride forbade\r\na resort to this manœuvre of weak minds; but by resorting to loans and\r\nthe costly operations of the bank, to provide the funds of war, and being\r\nstill connected with the house to which he addressed himself for much the\r\ngreater part of his negotiations. They have not remarked that his great\r\nprinciples of economy have nothing more than a false show, and that the\r\nloans resorted to, in order to avoid the imposition of taxes, have been\r\nthe source of the mischief which has reduced the finances to their present\r\nalarming condition.\r\n\r\nAs to his _compte rendu_; he has been forgiven the nauseous panegyric\r\nwhich he has passed upon himself, and the affectation of introducing\r\nhis wife into it, for the purpose of praising her: and we are spared\r\nthe trouble of examining his false calculations. M. de Calonnes has\r\nundertaken this investigation. Without being able to vindicate himself,\r\nhe has already begun to unmask his antagonist, and he promises to do it\r\neffectually.\r\n\r\nNecessity has recalled this man to the ministry; and it must be confessed\r\nthat he is beyond comparison a less mischievous minister than his\r\npredecessors. I would compare him to a steward, who, by his management,\r\ndoes not entirely ruin his master, but who enriches himself at his\r\nexpense. The desire of glory should inspire him as much as possible with\r\nthe energy requisite for the public business. There is every likelihood\r\nthat his ministry will not endure long enough to cause it to feel the\r\neffects of his false principles of administration; and it is he alone\r\nwho is able, if any one can, to preserve order in the finances, until\r\nthe reform is effected which we hope from the assembling of the States\r\nGeneral. In the meantime the public estimation of his talents and virtue\r\nis not so high as it has been. There are persons who pretend that he is\r\nmore firmly established in public opinion than he ever was. They deceive\r\nthemselves. The ambitious desire he has always manifested of getting again\r\ninto the administration, his work on the importance of religious opinions,\r\nand the memoires of M. de Calonnes, have greatly impaired his reputation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                      Paris, June 18, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,--My last to you was of May the 11th. Yours of March the 29th, came to\r\nhand ten days ago; and about two days ago I received a cover of your hand\r\nwriting, under which were a New York paper of May the 4th, and a letter\r\nfrom Mr. Page to Mazzei. There being no letter from you, makes me hope\r\nthere is one on the way, which will inform me of my congé. I have never\r\nreceived Mr. Jay's answer to my public letter, of November the 19th, which\r\nyou mention him to have written, and which I fear has been intercepted.\r\nI know only from you, that my letter got safe to hand. My baggage has\r\nbeen made up more than a month, so that I shall leave Paris almost in the\r\ninstant of receiving the permission.\r\n\r\nThe campaign begins under unfavorable auspices for Russia. The death of\r\nthe Grand Seignior, who was personally disposed for peace, has brought\r\na young and ardent successor to the throne, determined to push the war\r\nto extremity. Her only ally, the Emperor, is in _articulo mortis_, and\r\nthe Grand Duke of Tuscany, should he succeed, loves peace and money.\r\nDenmark is forbidden by England and Prussia to furnish even its stipulated\r\nmaritime aid. There is no appearance of any other power's engaging in the\r\nwar. As far as I can discover, the King of England is somewhat better\r\nin his head, but under such a complete depression of spirits, that he\r\ndoes not care how the world goes, and leaves his ministers to do as they\r\nplease. It is impossible for you to conceive how difficult it is to know\r\nthe truth relative to him, he is environed in such an atmosphere of lies.\r\nMen who would not speak a falsehood on any other subject, lie on this,\r\nfrom a principle of duty; so that even eye witnesses cannot be believed\r\nwithout scanning their principles and connections; and few will stand\r\nthis, of the very few permitted to see him.\r\n\r\nCommittees of conciliation having failed in their endeavors to bring\r\ntogether the three chambers of the States General, the King proposed a\r\nspecific mode of verifying their powers; for that having been the first\r\nquestion which presented itself to them, was the one in which the question\r\nof voting by persons or orders was first brought on. The Clergy accepted\r\nunconditionally. The Noblesse accepted on conditions which reduced the\r\nacceptance to nothing at all. The Commons considered this as a refusal on\r\nthe part of the Nobles, and thereupon took their definitive resolution,\r\nto invite the other two orders to come and verify their powers in common,\r\nand to notify them they should proceed with or without them to verify,\r\nand to do the business of the nation. This was on the 10th. On the 15th,\r\nthey moved to declare themselves the National Assembly. The debates on\r\nthis were finished yesterday, when the proposition was agreed to, by four\r\nhundred and odd, against eighty odd. The minority agreed in substance,\r\nbut wished some particular amendment. They then immediately made the\r\nproposition relative to taxes, which I enclose you, as this moment stated\r\nto me, by memory, by a member who left the Assembly a little before the\r\nquestion, because there was no opposition to the matter, but only to the\r\nform. He assures me, on the information of another member who was present,\r\nthat Target's motion passed. We shall know, I think, within a day or two,\r\nwhether the government will risk a bankruptcy and civil war, rather than\r\nsee all distinction of orders done away, which is what the Commons will\r\npush for. If the fear of the former alternative prevails, they will spin\r\nthe matter into negotiation. The Commons have in their chamber almost all\r\nthe talents of the nation; they are firm and bold, yet moderate. There\r\nis, indeed, among them, a number of very hot-headed members; but those of\r\nmost influence are cool, temperate and sagacious. Every step of this House\r\nhas been marked with caution and wisdom. The Noblesse, on the contrary,\r\nare absolutely out of their senses. They are so furious, they can seldom\r\ndebate at all. They have few men of moderate talents, and not one of\r\ngreat, in the majority. Their proceedings have been very injudicious.\r\nThe Clergy are waiting to profit by every incident to secure themselves,\r\nand have no other object in view. Among the Commons there is an entire\r\nunanimity on the great question of voting by persons. Among the Noblesse\r\nthere are about sixty for the Commons, and about three times that number\r\nagainst them. Among the Clergy, about twenty have already come over and\r\njoined the Commons, and in the course of a few days they will be joined\r\nby many more, not indeed making the majority of that House, but very near\r\nit. The Bishops and Archbishops have been very successful by bribes and\r\nintrigues, in detaching the Curés from the Commons, to whom they were at\r\nfirst attached to a man. The Commons are about five hundred and fifty-four\r\nin number, of whom three hundred and forty-four are of the law. These\r\ndo not possess an influence founded in property; but in their habits of\r\nbusiness and acquaintance with the people, and in their means of exciting\r\nthem as they please. The Curés throughout the kingdom, form the mass of\r\nthe Clergy; they are the only part favorably known to the people, because\r\nsolely charged with the duties of baptism, burial, confession, visitation\r\nof the sick, instruction of the children, and aiding the poor; they are\r\nthemselves of the people, and united with them. The carriages and equipage\r\nonly of the higher Clergy, not their persons, are known to the people, and\r\nare in detestation with them. The soldiers will follow their officers,\r\nthat is to say, their captains, lieutenants and ensigns. These are of\r\nthe lower nobility, and therefore much divided. The colonels and higher\r\nofficers are of the higher nobility, are seldom with the soldiers, little\r\nknown to them, not possessing their attachment. These circumstances give\r\nthem little weight in the partition of the army.\r\n\r\nI give you these miscellaneous observations, that knowing somewhat the\r\ndispositions of the parties, you may be able to judge of the future for\r\nyourself, as I shall not be here to continue its communication to you.\r\n\r\nIn hopes to see you soon, I conclude with assurances of the perfect esteem\r\nand respect with which I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                      Paris, June 24, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,--My letter of the 17th and 18th instant, gave you the progress of the\r\nStates General to the 17th, when the Tiers had declared the illegality\r\nof all the existing taxes, and their discontinuance from the end of\r\ntheir present session. The next day being a jour de fête, could furnish\r\nno indication of the impression that vote was likely to make on the\r\ngovernment. On the 19th, a Council was held at Marly, in the afternoon.\r\nIt was there proposed, that the King should interpose by a declaration\r\nof his sentiments in a _seance royale_. The declaration prepared by\r\nMr. Neckar, while it censured in general the proceedings both of the\r\nNobles and Commons, announced the King's views, such as substantially to\r\ncoincide with the Commons. It was agreed to in Council, as also that the\r\n_seance royale_ should be held on the 22d, and the meetings till then be\r\nsuspended. While the Council was engaged in this deliberation at Marly,\r\nthe chamber of the Clergy was in debate, whether they should accept the\r\ninvitation of the Tiers to unite with them in the common chamber. On the\r\nfirst question, to unite simply and unconditionally, it was decided in\r\nthe negative by a very small majority. As it was known, however, that\r\nsome members who had voted in the negative, would be for the affirmative\r\nwith some modifications, the question was put with these modifications,\r\nand it was determined by a majority of eleven members, that their body\r\nshould join the Tiers. These proceedings of the clergy were unknown to\r\nthe Council at Marly, and those of the Council were kept secret from\r\neverybody. The next morning (the 20th), the members repaired to the\r\nHouse as usual, found the doors shut and guarded, and a proclamation\r\nposted up for holding a _seance royale_ on the 22d, and a suspension\r\nof their meetings till then. They presumed, in the first moment, that\r\ntheir dissolution was decided, and repaired to another place, where they\r\nproceeded to business. They there bound themselves to each other by an\r\noath, never to separate of their own accord, till they had settled a\r\nconstitution for the nation on a solid basis, and if separated by force,\r\nthat they would re-assemble in some other place. It was intimated to them,\r\nhowever, that day, privately, that the proceedings of the _seance royale_\r\nwould be favorable to them. The next day they met in a church, and were\r\njoined by a majority of the Clergy. The heads of the aristocracy saw that\r\nall was lost without some violent exertion. The King was still at Marly.\r\nNobody was permitted to approach him but their friends. He was assailed\r\nby lies in all shapes. He was made to believe that the Commons were going\r\nto absolve the army from their oath of fidelity to him, and to raise their\r\npay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey procured a committee to be held, consisting of the King and his\r\nministers, to which Monsieur and the Count d'Artois should be admitted. At\r\nthis committee, the latter attacked Mr. Neckar personally, arraigned his\r\nplans, and proposed one which some of his engines had put into his hands.\r\nMr. Neckar, whose characteristic is the want of firmness, was browbeaten\r\nand intimidated, and the King shaken. He determined that the two plans\r\nshould be deliberated on the next day, and the _seance royale_ put off a\r\nday longer. This encouraged a fiercer attack on Mr. Neckar the next day;\r\nhis plan was totally dislocated, and that of the Count d'Artois inserted\r\ninto it. Himself and Monsieur de Montmorin offered their resignation,\r\nwhich was refused; the Count d'Artois saying to Mr. Neckar, \"No, Sir,\r\nyou must be kept as the hostage; we hold you responsible for all the ill\r\nwhich shall happen.\" This change of plan was immediately whispered without\r\ndoors. The nobility were in triumph, the people in consternation. When\r\nthe King passed the next day through the lane they formed from the Chateau\r\nto the Hotel des Etats (about half a mile), there was a dead silence. He\r\nwas about an hour in the House, delivering his speech and declaration,\r\ncopies of which I enclose you. On his coming out, a feeble cry of \"_vive\r\nle roy_\" was raised by some children, but the people remained silent and\r\nsullen. When the Duke d'Orleans followed, however, their applauses were\r\nexcessive. This must have been sensible to the King. He had ordered, in\r\nthe close of his speech, that the members should follow him, and resume\r\ntheir deliberations the next day. The Noblesse followed him, and so did\r\nthe Clergy, except about thirty, who, with the Tiers, remained in the\r\nroom, and entered into deliberation. They protested against what the\r\nKing had done, adhered to all their former proceedings, and resolved\r\nthe inviolability of their own persons. An officer came twice to order\r\nthem out of the room, in the King's name, but they refused to obey. In\r\nthe afternoon, the people, uneasy, began to assemble in great numbers in\r\nthe courts and vicinities of the palace. The Queen was alarmed, and sent\r\nfor Mr. Neckar. He was conducted amidst the shouts and acclamations of\r\nthe multitude, who filled all the apartments of the palace. He was a few\r\nminutes only with the Queen, and about three-quarters of an hour with\r\nthe King. Not a word has transpired of what passed at these interviews.\r\nThe King was just going to ride out. He passed through the crowd to his\r\ncarriage, and into it, without being in the least noticed. As Mr. Neckar\r\nfollowed him, universal acclamations were raised of \"Vive Monsieur Neckar,\r\nvive la sauveur de la France opprimée.\" He was conducted back to his\r\nhouse with the same demonstrations of affection and anxiety. About two\r\nhundred deputies of the Tiers, catching the enthusiasm of the moment, went\r\nto his house, and extorted from him a promise that he would not resign.\r\nThese circumstances must wound the heart of the King, desirous as he is,\r\nto possess the affections of his subjects. As soon as the proceedings at\r\nVersailles were known at Paris, a run began on the _caisse d'escompte_,\r\nwhich is the first symptom always of the public diffidence and alarm. It\r\nis the less in condition to meet the run, as Mr. Neckar has been forced\r\nto make free with its funds, for the daily support of the government. This\r\nis the state of things, as late as I am able to give them with certainty,\r\nat this moment. My letter not being to go off till to-morrow evening, I\r\nshall go to Versailles to-morrow, and be able to add the transactions of\r\nthis day and to-morrow.\r\n\r\nJune 25. Just returned from Versailles, I am enabled to continue my\r\nnarration. On the 24th, nothing remarkable passed, except an attack by\r\nthe mob of Versailles on the Archbishop of Paris, who had been one of the\r\ninstigators of the court, to the proceedings of the _seance royale_. They\r\nthrew mud and stones at his carriage, broke the windows of it, and he in\r\na fright promised to join the Tiers.\r\n\r\nThis day (the 25th) forty-eight of the Nobles have joined the Tiers. Among\r\nthese, is the Duke d'Orleans. The Marquis de La Fayette could not be of\r\nthe number, being restrained by his instructions. He is writing to his\r\nconstituents, to change his instructions or to accept his resignation.\r\nThere are with the Tiers now, one hundred and sixty-four members of the\r\nClergy, so that the common chamber consists of upwards of eight hundred\r\nmembers. The minority of the Clergy, however, call themselves the chamber\r\nof the Clergy, and pretend to go on with business. I found the streets of\r\nVersailles much embarrassed with soldiers. There was a body of about one\r\nhundred horse drawn up in front of the Hotel of the States, and all the\r\navenues and doors guarded by soldiers. Nobody was permitted to enter but\r\nthe members, and this was by order of the King; for till now, the doors\r\nof the common room have been open, and at least two thousand spectators\r\nattending their debates constantly. They have named a deputation to\r\nwait on the King, and desire a removal of the soldiery from their doors,\r\nand seem determined, if this is not complied with, to remove themselves\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nInstead of being dismayed with what has passed, they seem to rise in\r\ntheir demands, and some of them to consider the erasing every vestige of a\r\ndifference of order as indispensable to the establishment and preservation\r\nof a good constitution. I apprehend there is more courage than calculation\r\nin this project. I did imagine, that seeing that Mr. Neckar and themselves\r\nwere involved as common enemies in the hatred of the aristocrats, they\r\nwould have been willing to make common cause with him, and to wish his\r\ncontinuance in office; and that Mr. Neckar, seeing that all the trimming\r\nhe has used towards the court, and Nobles, has availed him nothing, would\r\nengage himself heartily and solely on the popular side, and view his own\r\nsalvation in that alone. The confidence which the people place in him,\r\nseems to merit some attention. However, the mass of the common chamber\r\nare absolutely indifferent to his remaining in office. They consider his\r\nhead as unequal to the planning a good constitution, and his fortitude to\r\na co-operation in the effecting it. His dismission is more credited to-day\r\nthan it was yesterday. If it takes place, he will retain his popularity\r\nwith the nation, as the members of the States will not think it important\r\nto set themselves against it, but on the contrary, will be willing that he\r\nshould continue on their side, on his retirement. The run on the _caisse\r\nd'escompte_ continues. The members of the States admit, that Mr. Neckar's\r\ndeparture out of office will occasion a stoppage of public payments.\r\nBut they expect to prevent any very ill effect, by assuring the public\r\nagainst any loss, and by taking immediate measures for continuing payment.\r\nThey may, perhaps, connect these measures with their own existence, so\r\nas to interest the public in whatever catastrophe may be aimed at them.\r\nThe gazettes of France and Leyden accompany this. During the continuance\r\nof this crisis and my own stay, I shall avail myself of every private\r\nconveyance to keep you informed of what passes. I have the honor to be,\r\nwith the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                      Paris, June 29, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,--My letter of the 25th gave you the transactions of the States\r\nGeneral to the afternoon of that day. On the next, the Archbishop of\r\nParis joined the Tiers, as did some others of the Clergy and Noblesse. On\r\nthe 27th, the question of the St. Domingo deputation came on, and it was\r\ndecided that it should be received. I have before mentioned to you the\r\nferment into which the proceedings at the _seance royale_ of the 23d, had\r\nthrown the people. The soldiery also were affected by it. It began in the\r\nFrench guards, extended to those of every other denomination, (except the\r\nSwiss) and even to the body guards of the King. They began to quit their\r\nbarracks, to assemble in squads, to declare they would defend the life of\r\nthe King, but would not cut the throats of their fellow-citizens. They\r\nwere treated and caressed by the people, carried in triumph through the\r\nstreets, called themselves the soldiers of the nation, and left no doubt\r\non which side they would be, in case of a rupture. Similar accounts came\r\nin from the troops in other parts of the kingdom, as well those which\r\nhad not heard of the _seance royale_, as those which had, and gave good\r\nreason to apprehend that the soldiery, in general, would side with their\r\nfathers and brothers, rather than with their officers. The operation of\r\nthis medicine, at Versailles, was as sudden as it was powerful. The alarm\r\nthere was so complete, that in the afternoon of the 27th, the King wrote\r\na letter to the President of the Clergy, the Cardinal de La Rochefoucault,\r\nin these words:[1]\r\n\r\n\"My Cousin,--Wholly engaged in promoting the general good of my kingdom,\r\nand desirous, above all things, that the Assembly of the States General\r\nshould apply themselves to objects of general interest, after the\r\nvoluntary acceptance by your order of my declaration of the 23d of the\r\npresent month; I pass my word that my faithful Clergy will, without delay,\r\nunite themselves with the other two orders, to hasten the accomplishment\r\nof my paternal views. Those, whose powers are too limited, may decline\r\nvoting until new powers are procured. This will be a new mark of\r\nattachment which my Clergy will give me. I pray God, my Cousin, to have\r\nyou in his holy keeping.\r\n\r\n                                                                    Louis.\"\r\n\r\nA like letter was written to the Duke de Luxemburgh, President of the\r\nNoblesse. The two chambers entered into debate on the question, whether\r\nthey should obey the letter of the King. There was a considerable\r\nopposition; when notes written by the Count d'Artois to sundry members,\r\nand handed about among the rest, decided the matter, and they went in a\r\nbody and took their seats with the Tiers, and thus rendered the union\r\nof the orders in one chamber complete. As soon as this was known to\r\nthe people of Versailles, they assembled about the palace, demanded the\r\nKing and Queen, who came and showed themselves in a balcony. They rent\r\nthe skies with cries of \"_vive le roy_,\" \"_vive la reine_.\" They called\r\nfor the Dauphin, who was also produced, and was the subject of new\r\nacclamations. After feasting themselves and the royal family with this\r\ntumultuary reconciliation, they went to the house of Mr. Neckar and M. de\r\nMontmorin, with shouts of thankfulness and affection. Similar emotions of\r\njoy took place in Paris, and at this moment, the triumph of the Tiers is\r\nconsidered as complete. To-morrow they will recommence business, voting\r\nby persons on all questions; and whatever difficulties may be opposed in\r\ndebate by the malcontents of the Clergy and Nobility, everything must\r\nbe finally settled at the will of the Tiers. It remains to see whether\r\nthey will leave to the Nobility anything but their titulary appellations.\r\nI suppose they will not. Mr. Neckar will probably remain in office. It\r\nwould seem natural that he should endeavor to have the hostile part of\r\nthe Council removed, but I question if he finds himself firm enough for\r\nthat. A perfect co-operation with the Tiers will be his wisest game. This\r\ngreat crisis being now over, I shall not have matter interesting enough\r\nto trouble you with, as often as I have done lately. There has nothing\r\nremarkable taken place in any other part of Europe. I have the honor to\r\nbe, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient,\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n     [1] [A translation is here given.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\n                                                       Paris, July 6, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I never made an offer to anybody, to have corn or flour brought\r\nhere, from America; no such idea ever entered my head. Mr. Neckar desired\r\nme to give information in America, that there would be a want of flour.\r\nI did so in a letter to Mr. Jay, which he published with my name to\r\nit, for the encouragement of the merchants. Those here, who have named\r\nme on this subject, must have mistaken me for Mr. Parker. I have heard\r\nhim say, he offered Mr. Neckar to bring a large supply, yet I do not\r\nthink I ever repeated this; or if I did, it must have been in a company\r\nI relied on. I will thank you to satisfy Mr. Neckar of the truth. It\r\nwould be disagreeable, and perhaps mischievous, were he to have an idea\r\nthat I encouraged censures on him. I will bring you the paper you desire\r\nto-morrow; and shall dine at the Dutchess Danville's, where I shall be\r\nhappy to meet you. Adieu. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\n                                                       Paris, July 7, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Your letter of yesterday gave me the first information that\r\nMonsieur de Mirabeau had suggested to the honorable the Assembly of the\r\nNation, that I had made an offer to Mr. Neckar, to obtain from America a\r\nquantity of corn or flour, which had been refused. I know not how Monsieur\r\nde Mirabeau has been led into this error. I never in my life made any\r\nproposition to Mr. Neckar on the subject; I never said I had made such a\r\nproposition. Some time last autumn, Mr. Neckar did me the honor to desire\r\nI would have notified in the United States, that corn and flour would meet\r\nwith a good sale in France. I conveyed this notice, in a letter to Mr.\r\nJay, Secretary for Foreign Affairs, as you will see by the extract of my\r\nletter published by him in an American gazette, which I have the honor to\r\nsend you. I must beg leave to avail myself of your friendship and of your\r\nposition, to have a communication of these facts made to the honorable\r\nAssembly of the Nation, of which you are a member, and to repeat to you\r\nthose sentiments of respect and attachment, with which I have the honor\r\nto be, my dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. NECKAR.\r\n\r\n                                                       Paris, July 8, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have the honor to enclose you a copy of my letter to Monsieur\r\nde La Fayette. When I called on him yesterday, he had already spoken to\r\nMonsieur de Mirabeau, who acknowledged he had been in an error in what he\r\nhad advanced in the Assembly of the Nation, as to the proposition supposed\r\nto have been made by me to your Excellency, and undertook to declare his\r\nerror, when the subject should be resumed by the Assembly, to whom my\r\nletter to the Marquis de La Fayette will be also read.\r\n\r\nI have thought it a duty, Sir, thus to correct in the first moment,\r\nan error, by which your name had been compromitted by an unfounded use\r\nof mine, and shall be happy in every occasion of proving to you those\r\nsentiments of profound respect and attachment with which I have the honor\r\nto be, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\n                                                       Paris, July 8, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,--My hotel having been lately robbed for the third time, I take the\r\nliberty of uniting my wish with that of the inhabitants of this quarter,\r\nthat it might coincide with the arrangements of police, to extend to us\r\nthe protection of a guard. While the Douane remained here, no accident\r\nof that kind happened, but since their removal, other houses in the\r\nneighborhood have been robbed, as well as mine. Perhaps it may lessen the\r\ndifficulties of this request, that the house occupied by the people of\r\nthe Douane, will lodge abundantly a _corps de garde_. On the one side of\r\nthat house is Chaillot, on the other the Roule, on the third the Champs\r\nElysées, where accidents are said to happen very frequently, all of which\r\nare very distant from any _corps de garde_.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect respect and\r\nesteem, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\n                                                       Paris, July 9, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Having been curious to form some estimate of the quantity of\r\ncorn and flour, which have been supplied to France this year, I applied to\r\na person in the Farms, to know upon what quantities the premium had been\r\npaid. He could not give me information, but as to the _Atlantic_ ports,\r\ninto which there have been imported from the United States, from March\r\nto May inclusive, forty-four thousand one hundred and sixteen quintals\r\nof corn, twelve thousand two hundred and twenty-one quintals of flour,\r\nmaking fifty-six thousand three hundred and thirty-seven quintals, in\r\nthe whole. Add to this, what has been imported since May, suppose nearly\r\ntwenty thousand quintals a month, and what has been furnished to the\r\nFrench islands, which has prevented an equal quantity being exported from\r\nFrance, and you will have the proportion drawn from us. Observe, that we\r\nhave regular and constant markets for corn and flour, in Spain, Portugal,\r\nand all the West India islands, except the French. These take nearly our\r\nwhole quantity. This year, France, the French West Indies and Canada were\r\nadded. But a regular course of trade is not quitted in an instant, nor\r\nconstant customers deserted for accidental ones. This is the reason that\r\nso small a proportion has come here. I am, dear Sir, with great sincerity,\r\nyour affectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\n                                                      Paris, July 10, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--The acknowledgment by Monsieur de Mirabeau to the National\r\nAssembly, that he had been in an error as to the offer he supposed me\r\nto have made, and the reading to them my letter, seem to be all that was\r\nrequisite for any just purpose. As I was unwilling my name should be used\r\nto injure the minister, I am also unwilling it should be used to injure\r\nMonsieur de Mirabeau. I learn that his enemies in Paris are framing\r\nscandalous versions of my letter. I think, therefore, with you, it may be\r\nbetter to print it, and I send you a copy of it. I gave copies of it to\r\nMonsieur de Montmorin and Monsieur Neckar, as was my duty.\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere affection, my dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS PAINE.\r\n\r\n                                                      Paris, July 11, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Since my last, which was of May the 19th, I have received yours\r\nof June the 17th and 18th. I am struck with the idea of the geometrical\r\nwheelbarrow, and will beg of you a farther account, if it can be obtained.\r\nI have no news yet of my congé.\r\n\r\nThough you have doubtless heard most of the proceedings of the States\r\nGeneral since my last, I will take up the narration where that left it,\r\nthat you may be able to separate the true from the false accounts you have\r\nheard. A good part of what was conjecture in that letter, is now become\r\ntrue history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _National Assembly_ then (for that is the name they take), having\r\nshown through every stage of these transactions a coolness, wisdom, and\r\nresolution to set fire to the four corners of the kingdom and to perish\r\nwith it themselves, rather than to relinquish an iota from their plan of a\r\ntotal change of government, are now in complete and undisputed possession\r\nof the sovereignty. The executive and aristocracy are at their feet; the\r\nmass of the nation, the mass of the clergy, and the army are with them;\r\nthey have prostrated the old government, and are now beginning to build\r\none from the foundation. A committee, charged with the arrangement of\r\ntheir business, gave in, two days ago, the following order of proceedings.\r\n\r\n\"1. Every government should have for its only end, the preservation of the\r\nrights of man; whence it follows, that to recall constantly the government\r\nto the end proposed, the constitution should begin by a declaration of\r\nthe natural and imprescriptible rights of man.\r\n\r\n\"2. Monarchical government being proper to maintain those rights, it has\r\nbeen chosen by the French nation. It suits especially a great society;\r\nit is necessary for the happiness of France. The declaration of the\r\nprinciples of this government, then, should follow immediately the\r\ndeclaration of the rights of man.\r\n\r\n\"3. It results from the principles of monarchy, that the nation, to\r\nassure its own rights, has yielded particular rights to the monarch; the\r\nconstitution, then, should declare, in a precise manner, the rights of\r\nboth. It should begin by declaring the rights of the French nation, and\r\nthen it should declare the rights of the King.\r\n\r\n\"4. The rights of the King and nation not existing but for the happiness\r\nof the individuals who compose it, they lead to an examination of the\r\nrights of citizens.\r\n\r\n\"5. The French nation not being capable of assembling individually, to\r\nexercise all its rights, it ought to be represented. It is necessary,\r\nthen, to declare the form of its representation and the rights of its\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n\"6. From the union of the powers of the nation and King should result\r\nthe enacting and execution of the laws; thus, then it should first\r\nbe determined how the laws shall be established afterwards should be\r\nconsidered, how they shall be executed.\r\n\r\n\"7. Laws have for their object the general administration of the kingdom,\r\nthe property and the actions of the citizens. The execution of the laws\r\nwhich concern the general administration requires Provincial and Municipal\r\nAssemblies. It is necessary to examine, therefore, what should be the\r\norganization of the Provincial Assemblies, and what of the Municipal.\r\n\r\n\"8. The execution of the laws which concern the property and actions of\r\nthe citizens, call for the judiciary power. It should be determined how\r\nthat should be confided, and then its duties and limits.\r\n\r\n\"9. For the execution of the laws and the defence of the kingdom, there\r\nexists a public force. It is necessary, then, to determine the principles\r\nwhich should direct it, and how it should be employed.\r\n\r\n\"_Recapitulation._\r\n\r\n\"Declaration of the rights of man. Principles of the monarchy. Rights of\r\nthe nation. Rights of the King. Rights of the citizens.\r\n\r\n\"Organization and rights of the National Assembly. Forms necessary for\r\nthe enaction of laws. Organization and functions of the Provincial and\r\nMunicipal Assemblies. Duties and limits of the judiciary power. Functions\r\nand duties of the military power.\"\r\n\r\nYou see that these are the materials of a superb edifice, and the hands\r\nwhich have prepared them, are perfectly capable of putting them together,\r\nand of filling up the work of which these are only the outlines. While\r\nthere are some men among them of very superior abilities, the mass possess\r\nsuch a degree of good sense, as enables them to decide well. I have always\r\nbeen afraid their numbers might lead to confusion. Twelve hundred men\r\nin one room are too many. I have still that fear. Another apprehension\r\nis, that a majority cannot be induced to adopt the trial by jury; and\r\nI consider that as the only anchor ever yet imagined by man, by which a\r\ngovernment can be held to the principles of its constitution. Mr. Paradise\r\nis the bearer of this letter. He can supply those details which it would\r\nbe too tedious to write.\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MASON.\r\n\r\n                                                      Paris, July 16, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,--I am honored with your favor of the 11th, and sincerely thank you\r\nfor the offer of your ship, which I would certainly have embraced, had I\r\nbeen at liberty to go. But I have not yet received permission, and must\r\nawait that. I beg you to remember me in the most friendly terms to your\r\nfather. I have put off answering his letter because I expected constantly\r\nto make my voyage to America and to see him at his own house.\r\n\r\nGreat events have taken place here within these few days. The change of\r\nthe ministry and the tumult of Paris consequent on that, you will have\r\nheard of. Yesterday the King went without any cortege but his two brothers\r\nto the States General, and spoke to them in very honest and conciliatory\r\nterms; such as in my opinion amounts to a surrender at discretion. The\r\ntemper of the city is too much heated at present to view them in that\r\nlight, and therefore they keep on the watch, and go on in organizing their\r\narmed Bourgeoise. But I have not a single doubt of the sincerity of the\r\nKing, and there will not be another disagreeable act from him. He has\r\npromised to send away the troops.\r\n\r\nI am with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                      Paris, July 19, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I am become very uneasy, lest you should have adopted some\r\nchannel for the conveyance of your letters to me, which is unfaithful.\r\nI have none from you of later date than November the 25th, 1788, and\r\nof consequence, no acknowledgment of the receipt of any of mine, since\r\nthat of August the 11th, 1788. Since that period, I have written to you\r\nof the following dates. 1788. August the 20th, September the 3d, 5th,\r\n24th, November the 14th, 19th, 29th. 1789. January the 11th, 14th, 21st,\r\nFebruary the 4th, March the 1st, 12th, 14th, 15th, May the 9th, 11th,\r\n12th, June the 17th, 24th, 29th. I know, through another person, that\r\nyou have received mine of November the 29th, and that you have written\r\nan answer; but I have never received the answer, and it is this which\r\nsuggests to me the fear of some general source of miscarriage.\r\n\r\nThe capture of three French merchant ships by the Algerines, under\r\ndifferent pretexts, has produced great sensation in the seaports of this\r\ncountry, and some in its government. They have ordered some frigates\r\nto be armed at Toulon to punish them. There is a possibility that this\r\ncircumstance, if not too soon set to rights by the Algerines, may furnish\r\noccasion to the States General, when they shall have leisure to attend to\r\nmatters of this kind, to disavow any future tributary treaty with them.\r\nThese pirates respect still less their treaty with Spain, and treat the\r\nSpaniards with an insolence greater than was usual before the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of bread begins to lessen in the southern parts of France,\r\nwhere the harvest has commenced. Here it is still threatening, because\r\nwe have yet three weeks to the beginning of harvest, and I think there\r\nhas not been three days' provision beforehand in Paris, for two or three\r\nweeks past. Monsieur de Mirabeau, who is very hostile to Mr. Neckar,\r\nwished to find a ground for censuring him, in a proposition to have\r\na great quantity of flour furnished from the United States, which he\r\nsupposed me to have made to Mr. Neckar, and to have been refused by him;\r\nand he asked time of the States General to furnish proofs. The Marquis\r\nde La Fayette immediately gave me notice of this matter, and I wrote him\r\na letter to disavow having ever made any such proposition to Mr. Neckar,\r\nwhich I desired him to communicate to the States. I waited immediately on\r\nMr. Neckar and Monsieur de Montmorin, satisfied them that what had been\r\nsuggested was absolutely without foundation from me; and indeed they had\r\nnot needed this testimony. I gave them copies of my letter to the Marquis\r\nde La Fayette, which was afterwards printed. The Marquis, on the receipt\r\nof my letter, showed it to Mirabeau, who turned then to a paper from which\r\nhe had drawn his information, and found he had totally mistaken it. He\r\npromised immediately that he would himself declare his error to the States\r\nGeneral, and read to them my letter, which he did. I state this matter to\r\nyou, though of little consequence in itself, because it might go to you\r\nmisstated in the English papers.\r\n\r\nOur supplies to the Atlantic ports of France, during the months of March,\r\nApril and May, were only twelve thousand two hundred and twenty quintals,\r\nthirty-three pounds of flour, and forty-four thousand one hundred and\r\nfifteen quintals, forty pounds of wheat, in twenty-one vessels.\r\n\r\nMy letter of the 29th of June, brought down the proceedings of the\r\nStates and government to the re-union of the orders, which took place\r\non the 27th. Within the Assembly, matters went on well. But it was soon\r\nobserved, that troops, and particularly the foreign troops, were on their\r\nmarch towards Paris from various quarters, and that this was against\r\nthe opinion of Mr. Neckar. The King was probably advised to this, under\r\npretext of preserving peace in Paris and Versailles, and saw nothing else\r\nin the measure. That his advisers are supposed to have had in view, when\r\nhe should be secured and inspirited by the presence of the troops, to\r\ntake advantage of some favorable moment, and surprise him into an act of\r\nauthority for establishing the declaration of the 23d of June, and perhaps\r\ndispersing the States General, is probable. The Marshal de Broglio was\r\nappointed to command all the troops within the isle of France, a high\r\nflying aristocrat, cool and capable of everything. Some of the French\r\nguards were soon arrested under other pretexts, but in reality, on account\r\nof their dispositions in favor of the national cause. The people of Paris\r\nforced the prison, released them, and sent a deputation to the States\r\nGeneral, to solicit a pardon. The States, by a most moderate and prudent\r\nArreté, recommended these prisoners to the King, and peace to the people\r\nof Paris. Addresses came in to them from several of the great cities,\r\nexpressing sincere allegiance to the King, but a determined resolution\r\nto support the States General. On the 8th of July, they voted an address\r\nto the King to remove the troops. This[2] piece of masculine eloquence,\r\nwritten by Monsieur de Mirabeau, is worth attention on account of the bold\r\nmatter it expresses and discovers through the whole. The King refused to\r\nremove the troops, and said they might remove themselves, if they pleased,\r\nto Noyons or Soissons. They proceeded to fix the order in which they will\r\ntake up the several branches of their future constitution, from which it\r\nappears, they mean to build it from the bottom, confining themselves to\r\nnothing in their ancient form, but a King. A declaration of rights, which\r\nforms the first chapter of their work, was then proposed by the Marquis de\r\nLa Fayette. This was on the 11th. In the meantime, troops, to the number\r\nof about twenty-five or thirty thousand, had arrived, and were posted in\r\nand between Paris and Versailles. The bridges and passes were guarded. At\r\nthree o'clock in the afternoon, the Count de La Luzerne was sent to notify\r\nMr. Neckar of his dismission, and to enjoin him to retire instantly,\r\nwithout saying a word of it to anybody. He went home, dined, proposed\r\nto his wife a visit to a friend, but went in fact to his country-house\r\nat St. Ouen, and at midnight, set out from thence, as is supposed, for\r\nBrussels. This was not known till the next day, when the whole ministry\r\nwas changed, except Villedeuil, of the domestic department, and Barentin,\r\nGarde des Sceaux. These changes were as follows: the Baron de Breteuil,\r\nPresident of the Council of Finance; and de La Galaisiere, Comptroller\r\nGeneral in the room of Mr. Neckar; the Marshal de Broglio, minister\r\nof war, and Foulon under him, in the room of Puy-Segur; Monsieur de La\r\nVauguyon, minister of foreign affairs, instead of Monsieur de Montmorin;\r\nde La Porte, minister of marine, in place of the Count de La Luzerne;\r\nSt. Priest was also removed from the Council. It is to be observed, that\r\nLuzerne and Puy-Segur had been strongly of the aristocratical party in\r\nCouncil; but they were not considered as equal to bear their shares in\r\nthe work now to be done. For this change, however sudden it may have been\r\nin the mind of the King, was, in that of his advisers, only one chapter\r\nof a great plan, of which the bringing together the foreign troops had\r\nbeen the first. He was now completely in the hands of men, the principal\r\namong whom, had been noted through their lives, for the Turkish despotism\r\nof their characters, and who were associated about the King, as proper\r\ninstruments for what was to be executed. The news of this change began to\r\nbe known in Paris about one or two o'clock. In the afternoon, a body of\r\nabout one hundred German cavalry were advanced and drawn up in the Place\r\nLouis XV. and about two hundred Swiss posted at a little distance in their\r\nrear. This drew the people to that spot, who naturally formed themselves\r\nin front of the troops, at first merely to look at them. But as their\r\nnumbers increased, their indignation arose; they retired a few steps,\r\nposted themselves on and behind large piles of loose stone, collected\r\nin that place for a bridge adjacent to it, and attacked the horse with\r\nstones. The horse charged, but the advantageous position of the people,\r\nand the showers of stones, obliged them to retire, and even to quit the\r\nfield altogether, leaving one of their number on the ground. The Swiss in\r\ntheir rear were observed never to stir. This was the signal for universal\r\ninsurrection, and this body of cavalry, to avoid being massacred, retired\r\ntowards Versailles. The people now armed themselves with such weapons as\r\nthey could find in armorers' shops and private houses, and with bludgeons,\r\nand were roaming all night through all parts of the city, without any\r\ndecided practicable object. The next day, the States pressed on the King\r\nto send away the troops, to permit the Bourgeoise of Paris to arm for\r\nthe preservation of order in the city, and offered to send a deputation\r\nfrom their body to tranquillize them. He refused all their propositions.\r\nA committee of magistrates and electors of the city were appointed by\r\ntheir bodies, to take upon them its government. The mob, now openly joined\r\nby the French guards, forced the prison of St. Lazare, released all the\r\nprisoners, and took a great store of corn, which they carried to the corn\r\nmarket. Here they got some arms, and the French guards began to form\r\nand train them. The committee determined to raise forty-eight thousand\r\nBourgeoise, or rather to restrain their numbers to forty-eight thousand.\r\nOn the 14th, they sent one of their members (Monsieur de Corny, whom\r\nwe knew in America) to the Hotel des Invalides, to ask arms for their\r\nGarde Bourgeoise. He was followed by, or he found there, a great mob. The\r\nGovernor of the Invalides came out, and represented the impossibility of\r\nhis delivering arms, without the orders of those from whom he received\r\nthem. De Corny advised the people then to retire, and retired himself;\r\nand the people took possession of the arms. It was remarkable, that not\r\nonly the Invalides themselves made no opposition, but that a body of\r\nfive thousand foreign troops, encamped within four hundred yards, never\r\nstirred. Monsieur de Corny and five others were then sent to ask arms of\r\nMonsieur de Launai, Governor of the Bastile. They found a great collection\r\nof people already before the place, and they immediately planted a flag\r\nof truce, which was answered by a like flag hoisted on the parapet.\r\nThe deputation prevailed on the people to fall back a little, advanced\r\nthemselves to make their demand of the Governor, and in that instant a\r\ndischarge from the Bastile killed four people of those nearest to the\r\ndeputies. The deputies retired; the people rushed against the place, and\r\nalmost in an instant were in possession of a fortification, defended by\r\none hundred men, of infinite strength, which in other times had stood\r\nseveral regular sieges, and had never been taken. How they got in, has,\r\nas yet, been impossible to discover. Those who pretend to have been of\r\nthe party tell so many different stories, as to destroy the credit of\r\nthem all. They took all the arms, discharged the prisoners, and such\r\nof the garrison as were not killed in the first moment of fury, carried\r\nthe Governor and Lieutenant Governor to the Gréve, (the place of public\r\nexecution,) cut off their heads, and sent them through the city in triumph\r\nto the Palais Royal. About the same instant, a treacherous correspondence\r\nhaving been discovered in Monsieur de Flesselles, Prevost des Marchands,\r\nthey seized him in the Hotel de Ville, where he was in the exercise of\r\nhis office, and cut off his head. These events, carried imperfectly to\r\nVersailles, were the subject of two successive deputations from the States\r\nto the King, to both of which he gave dry and hard answers; for it has\r\ntranspired, that it had been proposed and agitated in Council, to seize\r\non the principal members of the States General, to march the whole army\r\ndown upon Paris, and to suppress its tumults by the sword. But at night,\r\nthe Duke de Liancourt forced his way into the King's bed chamber, and\r\nobliged him to hear a full and animated detail of the disasters of the day\r\nin Paris. He went to bed deeply impressed. The decapitation of de Launai\r\nworked powerfully through the night on the whole aristocratical party,\r\ninsomuch, that in the morning, those of the greatest influence on the\r\nCount d'Artois, represented to him the absolute necessity that the King\r\nshould give up everything to the States. This according well enough with\r\nthe dispositions of the King, he went about eleven o'clock, accompanied\r\nonly by his brothers, to the States General, and there read to them a\r\nspeech, in which he asked their interposition to re-establish order.\r\nThough this be couched in terms of some caution, yet the manner in which\r\nit was delivered, made it evident that it was meant as a surrender at\r\ndiscretion. He returned to the chateau a foot, accompanied by the States.\r\nThey sent off a deputation, the Marquis de La Fayette at their head, to\r\nquiet Paris. He had, the same morning, been named Commandant-in-Chief\r\nof the Milice Bourgeoise, and Monsieur Bailly, former President of the\r\nStates General, was called for as Prevost des Marchands. The demolition\r\nof the Bastile was now ordered, and begun. A body of the Swiss guards of\r\nthe regiment of Ventimille, and the city horse guards, joined the people.\r\nThe alarm at Versailles increased instead of abating. They believed that\r\nthe aristocrats of Paris were under pillage and carnage, that one hundred\r\nand fifty thousand men were in arms, coming to Versailles to massacre the\r\nroyal family, the court, the ministers, and all connected with them, their\r\npractices and principles. The aristocrats of the Nobles and Clergy in\r\nthe States General, vied with each other in declaring how sincerely they\r\nwere converted to the justice of voting by persons, and how determined to\r\ngo with the nation all its lengths. The foreign troops were ordered off\r\ninstantly. Every minister resigned. The King confirmed Bailly as Prevost\r\ndes Marchands, wrote to Mr. Neckar to recall him, sent his letter open\r\nto the States General, to be forwarded by them, and invited them to go\r\nwith him to Paris the next day, to satisfy the city of his dispositions;\r\nand that night and the next morning, the Count d'Artois and Monsieur\r\nde Montisson (a deputy connected with him) Madame de Polignac, Madame\r\nde Guiche, and the Count de Vaudreuil, favorites of the Queen, the Abbé\r\nde Vermont, her confessor, the Prince of Condé and Duke de Bourbon, all\r\nfled; we know not whither. The King came to Paris, leaving the Queen\r\nin consternation for his return. Omitting the less important figures\r\nof the procession, I will only observe, that the King's carriage was in\r\nthe centre, on each side of it the States General, in two ranks, a foot,\r\nand at their head the Marquis de La Fayette, as Commander-in-Chief, on\r\nhorseback, and Bourgeoise guards before and behind. About sixty thousand\r\ncitizens of all forms and colors, armed with the muskets of the Bastile\r\nand Invalides, as far as they would go, the rest with pistols, swords,\r\npikes, pruning hooks, scythes, &c., lined all the streets through which\r\nthe procession passed, and, with the crowds of people in the streets,\r\ndoors and windows, saluted them everywhere with cries of \"_vive la\r\nnation_;\" but not a single \"_vive le roy_\" was heard. The King stopped\r\nat the Hotel de Ville. There Monsieur Bailly presented and put into his\r\nhat the popular cockade, and addressed him. The King being unprepared\r\nand unable to answer, Bailly went to him, gathered from him some scraps\r\nof sentences, and made out an answer, which he delivered to the audience\r\nas from the King. On their return, the popular cries were \"_vive le roy\r\net la nation_.\" He was conducted by a Garde Bourgeoise to his palace at\r\nVersailles, and thus concluded such an _amende honorable_, as no sovereign\r\never made, and no people ever received. Letters written with his own\r\nhand to the Marquis de La Fayette, remove the scruples of his position.\r\nTranquillity is now restored to the capital: the shops are again opened;\r\nthe people resuming their labors, and if the want of bread does not\r\ndisturb our peace, we may hope a continuance of it. The demolition of the\r\nBastile is going on, and the Milice Bourgeoise organizing and training.\r\nThe ancient police of the city is abolished by the authority of the\r\npeople, the introduction of the King's troops will probably be proscribed,\r\nand a watch or city guards substituted, which shall depend on the city\r\nalone. But we cannot suppose this paroxysm confined to Paris alone. The\r\nwhole country must pass successively through it, and happy if they get\r\nthrough it as soon and as well as Paris has done.\r\n\r\nI went yesterday to Versailles, to satisfy myself what had passed\r\nthere; for nothing can be believed but what one sees, or has from an\r\neye witness. They believe there still, that three thousand people have\r\nfallen victims to the tumults of Paris. Mr. Short and myself have been\r\nevery day among them, in order to be sure what was passing. We cannot\r\nfind, with certainty, that anybody has been killed but the three before\r\nmentioned, and those who fell in the assault or defence of the Bastile.\r\nHow many of the garrison were killed, nobody pretends to have ever heard.\r\nOf the assailants, accounts vary from six to six hundred. The most general\r\nbelief is, that there fell about thirty. There have been many reports\r\nof instantaneous executions by the mob, on such of their body as they\r\ncaught in acts of theft or robbery. Some of these may perhaps be true.\r\nThere was a severity of honesty observed, of which no example has been\r\nknown. Bags of money offered on various occasions through fear or guilt,\r\nhave been uniformly refused by the mobs. The churches are now occupied in\r\nsinging \"_De profundis_\" and \"_Requiems_\" \"for the repose of the souls\r\nof the brave and valiant citizens who have sealed with their blood the\r\nliberty of the nation.\" Monsieur de Montmorin is this day replaced in the\r\ndepartment of foreign affairs, and Monsieur de St. Priest is named to the\r\nhome department. The gazettes of France and Leyden accompany this. I send,\r\nalso, a paper (called the Point du Jour), which will give you some idea of\r\nthe proceedings of the National Assembly. It is but an indifferent thing;\r\nhowever, it is the best.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem and respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. _July 21._ Mr. Neckar had left Brussels for Frankfort, before the\r\ncourier got there. We expect, however, to hear of him in a day or two.\r\nMonsieur le Comte de La Luzerne has resumed the department of the marine\r\nthis day. Either this is an office of friendship effected by Monsieur de\r\nMontmorin, (for though they had taken different sides, their friendship\r\ncontinued,) or he comes in as a stop-gap, till somebody else can be found.\r\nThough very unequal to his office, all agree that he is an honest man.\r\nThe Count d'Artois was at Valenciennes. The Prince of Condé and Duke de\r\nBourbon had passed that place.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n     [2] See it in the paper called Point du Jour, No. 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. L'ABBÉ ARNOLD.\r\n\r\n                                                      Paris, July 19, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--The annexed is a catalogue of all the books I recollect on the\r\nsubject of juries. With respect to the value of this institution, I must\r\nmake a general observation. We think, in America, that it is necessary to\r\nintroduce the people into every department of government, as far as they\r\nare capable of exercising it; and that this is the only way to insure a\r\nlong-continued and honest administration of its powers.\r\n\r\n1. They are not qualified to exercise themselves the executive department,\r\nbut they are qualified to name the person who shall exercise it. With\r\nus, therefore, they choose this officer every four years. 2. They are\r\nnot qualified to legislate. With us, therefore, they only choose the\r\nlegislators. 3. They are not qualified to _judge_ questions of _law_,\r\nbut they are very capable of judging questions of _fact_. In the form of\r\njuries, therefore, they determine all matters of fact, leaving to the\r\npermanent judges, to decide the law resulting from those facts. But we\r\nall know that permanent judges acquire an _Esprit de corps_; that being\r\nknown, they are liable to be tempted by bribery; that they are misled\r\nby favor, by relationship, by a spirit of party, by a devotion to the\r\nexecutive or legislative power; that it is better to leave a cause to the\r\ndecision of cross and pile, than to that of a judge biased to one side;\r\nand that the opinion of twelve honest jurymen gives still a better hope\r\nof right, than cross and pile does. It is in the power, therefore, of the\r\njuries, if they think permanent judges are under any bias whatever, in any\r\ncause, to take on themselves to judge the law as well as the fact. They\r\nnever exercise this power but when they suspect partiality in the judges;\r\nand by the exercise of this power, they have been the firmest bulwarks\r\nof English liberty. Were I called upon to decide, whether the people had\r\nbest be omitted in the legislative or judiciary department, I would say\r\nit is better to leave them out of the legislative. The execution of the\r\nlaws is more important than the making them. However, it is best to have\r\nthe people in all the three departments, where that is possible.\r\n\r\nI write in great haste, my dear Sir, and have, therefore, only time to add\r\nwishes for the happiness of your country, to which a new order of things\r\nis opening; and assurances of the sincere esteem with which I have the\r\nhonor to be, dear Sir, your most obedient and humble servant.\r\n\r\n_Books on the subject of Juries._\r\n\r\n  Complete Juryman, or a compendium of the laws relating to jurors.\r\n\r\n  Guide to English juries.\r\n\r\n  Hawles' Englishman's right.\r\n\r\n  Juror's judges both of law and fact, by Jones.\r\n\r\n  Security of Englishmen's lives, or the duty of grand juries.\r\n\r\n  Walwin's juries justified.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                      Paris, July 22, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--My last to you was of the 18th of June. Within a day or two\r\nafter, yours of May the 9th came to hand. In the rest of Europe nothing\r\nremarkable has happened; but in France such events as will be forever\r\nmemorable in history. To begin where my last left them, the King took\r\non himself to decide the great question of voting by persons or orders,\r\nby a declaration made at a _seance royale_ on the 23d of June. In the\r\nsame declaration he inserted many other things, some good, some bad. The\r\nTiers, undismayed, resolved the whole was a mere nullity, and proceeded\r\nas if nothing had happened. The majority of the clergy joined them,\r\nand a small part of the nobles. The uneasiness produced by the King's\r\ndeclaration occasioned the people to collect about the palace in the\r\nevening of the same day. The King and Queen were alarmed and sent for Mr.\r\nNeckar. He was conducted to and from the palace amidst the acclamations\r\nof the people. The French guards were observed to be mixed in great\r\nnumbers with the people and to participate of their passions. This made\r\nso decisive an impression, that the King on the 27th wrote to the clergy\r\nand nobles, who had not yet joined the Tiers, recommending to them to go\r\nand join them. They did so, and it was imagined all was now settled. It\r\nwas soon observed, however, that troops, and those the foreign troops,\r\nwere marching towards Paris from different quarters. The States addressed\r\nthe King to forbid their approach. He declared it was only to preserve\r\nthe tranquillity of Paris and Versailles, and I believe he thought so.\r\nThe command of those troops was given to the Marshal Broglio, and it was\r\nobserved that the Baron de Breteuil was going daily to Versailles. On\r\nthe 11th, there being now thirty thousand foreign troops in and between\r\nParis and Versailles, Mr. Neckar was dismissed and ordered to retire\r\nprivately. The next day the whole ministry was changed except Villedeuil\r\nand Barentin. Breteuil, Broglio and Vauguyon were the principal persons\r\nnamed in the new. A body of cavalry were advanced into Paris to awe\r\nthem. The people attacked and routed them, killing one of the cavalry\r\nand losing a French guard. The corps of French guards gathered stronger,\r\nfollowed the cavalry, attacked them in the street, (_the rue basse des\r\nramparts_,) and killed four. (I did not know this fact with certainty\r\nwhen I wrote to Mr. Jay, it is therefore not in my letter. I since have\r\nit from an eye-witness.) The insurrection became now universal. The next\r\nday (the 13th) the people forced a prison and took some arms. On the\r\n14th a committee was framed by the city, with powers corresponding to our\r\ncommittees of safety. They resolve to raise a city militia of forty-eight\r\nthousand men. The people attack the invalids and get a great store of\r\narms. They then attack and carry the Bastile, cut off the Governor's and\r\nLieutenant-Governor's heads, and that also of the Prevost des Marchand's,\r\ndiscovered in a treacherous correspondence. While these things were\r\ndoing here, the council is said to have been agitating at Versailles a\r\nproposition to arrest a number of the members of the States, to march all\r\nthe foreign troops against Paris, and suppress the tumult by the sword.\r\nBut the decapitations being once known there, and that there were fifty\r\nor sixty thousand men in arms, the King went to the States, referred\r\neverything to them, and ordered away the troops. The City Committee named\r\nthe Marquis de La Fayette commander-in-chief. They went on organizing\r\ntheir militia, the tumult continued, and a noise spread about Versailles\r\nthat they were coming to massacre the court, the ministry, &c. Every\r\nminister hereupon resigned and fled, the Count d'Artois, Prince of Condé,\r\nDuke de Bourbon, the family of Polignacs, the Count de Vaudreuil, Abbé\r\nVermont, confessor of the Queen, and key-stone of all the intrigues, all\r\nfled out of the kingdom. The King agreed to recall Mr. Neckar, reappointed\r\nMontmorin and St. Priest, friends of Neckar, and came with the States\r\nGeneral to Paris to satisfy the city of his dispositions. All the streets\r\nthrough which he passed were lined with Bourgeoise, armed with guns,\r\npistols, pikes, pruning-hooks, scythes, and whatever they could lay\r\nhold of, about sixty thousand. The States General on foot on each side\r\nof his coach, the Marquis de La Fayette at their head, on horseback.\r\nHe returned to Versailles in the same order, to the great joy of the\r\nremaining courtiers, who feared he would have been detained in Paris.\r\nThe tumults in the city had pretty well subsided, but to-day they have\r\nbeen revived by a new incident. Foulon, one of the fugitive ministers,\r\nwas taken in the country, (it is said by his own tenants,) and brought\r\nto Paris. Every possible effort of persuasion was exerted in vain to\r\nsave him. He was forced from the hands of the Gardes Bourgeoises by the\r\nmob, was hung, and after severing his head, the body was dragged by the\r\nenraged populace through the principal streets of Paris. The Intendant of\r\nParis (de Chauvigny), accused of having been in the plots with the late\r\nministry, and who had fled, was taken at Compiegne, and a party of two\r\nhundred militia horse are now gone for him. If they bring him to Paris it\r\nwill be impossible to save him. Monsieur de La Luzerne was reappointed\r\nminister of marine yesterday. Your last letter says nothing of my leave\r\nof absence. The season is so far advanced towards the Equinox, that if\r\nit comes to hand I shall not leave Europe till that be over. Indeed this\r\nscene is too interesting to be left at present. But if the permission does\r\nnot come in time for my passage in the fall, the necessity of my going is\r\nso imperious, that I shall be in a most distressing dilemma.\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere esteem and respect, dear Sir, your affectionate friend\r\nand servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. _July 23._ I just learn that Bertier de Chauvigny was brought to\r\ntown in the night and massacred immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                      Paris, July 23, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,--The bearer of my letters (a servant of Mr. Morris) not going off\r\ntill to-day, I am enabled to add to their contents. The spirit of tumult\r\nseemed to have subsided, when, yesterday, it was excited again, by a\r\nparticular incident. Monsieur Foulon, one of the obnoxious ministry,\r\nwho, as well as his brethren, had absconded, was taken in the country,\r\nand, as is said, by his own tenants, and brought to Paris. Great efforts\r\nwere exerted by popular characters, to save him. He was at length forced\r\nout of the hands of the Garde Bourgeoise, hung immediately, his head\r\ncut off, and his body drawn through the principal streets of the city.\r\nThe Intendant of Paris, Monsieur de Chauvigny, accused of having entered\r\ninto the designs of the said ministry, has been taken at Compiegne, and a\r\nbody of two hundred men on horseback have gone for him. If he be brought\r\nhere, it will be difficult to save him. Indeed, it is hard to say at what\r\ndistance of time the presence of one of those ministers, or of any of\r\nthe most obnoxious of the fugitive courtiers, will not rekindle the same\r\nblood-thirsty spirit. I hope it is extinguished as to everybody else,\r\nand yesterday's example will teach them to keep out of its way. I add two\r\nother sheets of the Point du Jour, and am, with the most perfect esteem\r\nand respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. I just now learn that Bertier de Chauvigny was brought to town last\r\nnight, and massacred immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                      Paris, July 29, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have written you lately, on the 24th of June, with a postscript\r\nof the 25th; on the 29th of the same month; the 19th of July, with a\r\npostscript of the 21st; and again on the 23d. Yesterday I received yours\r\nof the 9th of March, by the way of Holland.\r\n\r\nMr. Neckar has accepted his appointment, and will arrive to-day from\r\nSwitzerland, where he had taken refuge. No other ministers have been\r\nnamed since my last. It is thought that Mr. Neckar will choose his own\r\nassociates. The tranquillity of Paris has not been disturbed since the\r\ndeath of Foulon and Bertier mentioned in my last. Their militia is in a\r\ncourse of organization. It is impossible to know the exact state of the\r\nsupplies of bread. We suppose them low and precarious, because, some days,\r\nwe are allowed to buy but half or three-fourths of the daily allowance\r\nof our families. Yet as the wheat harvest must begin within ten days or\r\na fortnight, we are in hopes there will be subsistence found till that\r\ntime. This is the only source from which I should fear a renewal of the\r\nlate disorders; for I take for granted, the fugitives from the wrath of\r\ntheir country are all safe in foreign countries. Among these, are numbered\r\nseven Princes of the house of Bourbon, and six ministers; the seventh (the\r\nMarshal de Broglio), being shut up in the fortified town of Metz, strongly\r\ngarrisoned with foreign soldiers. I observed to you, in a preceding\r\nletter, that the storm which had begun in Paris, on the change of the\r\nministry, would have to pass over the whole country, and consequently\r\nwould, for a short time, occasion us terrible details from the different\r\nparts of it. Among these, you will find a horrid one retailed from Vesoul,\r\nin French Compté. The atrociousness of the fact would dispose us rather\r\nto doubt the truth of the evidence on which it rests, however regular\r\nthat appears. There is no question, that a number of people were blown\r\nup; but there are reasons for suspecting that it was by accident and not\r\ndesign. It is said the owner of the chateau sold powder by the pound,\r\nwhich was kept in the cellar of the house blown up; and it is possible,\r\nsome one of the guests may have taken this occasion to supply himself,\r\nand been too careless in approaching the mass. Many idle stories have\r\nalso been propagated and believed here, against the English, as that they\r\nhave instigated the late tumults with money, that they had taken or were\r\npreparing to take Cherbourg, Brest, &c.; and even reasonable men have\r\nbelieved, or pretended to believe, all these. The British ambassador has\r\nthought it necessary to disavow them in a public letter, which you will\r\nfind in one of the papers accompanying this.\r\n\r\nI have lately had an opportunity of knowing with certainty, the present\r\nstate of the King of England. His recovery was slow; he passed through\r\na stage of profound melancholy; but this has at length dissipated, and\r\nhe is at present perfectly re-established. He talks now as much as ever,\r\non the same trifling subjects, and has recovered even his habitual\r\ninquisitiveness into the small news of the families about him. His\r\nhealth is also good, though he is not as fleshy as he used to be. I have\r\nmultiplied my letters to you lately, because the scene has been truly\r\ninteresting; so much so, that had I received my permission to pay my\r\nprojected visit to my own country, I should have thought, and should still\r\nthink it my duty to defer it awhile. I presume it cannot now be long,\r\nbefore I receive your definitive answer to my request. I send herewith the\r\npublic papers, as usual; and have the honor to be, with the most perfect\r\nesteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\n                                                     Paris, August 9, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Since your last of March the 27th, I have only written that of\r\nMay the 8th. The cause of this long silence, on both parts, has been the\r\nexpectation I communicated to you of embarking for America. In fact, I\r\nhave expected permission for this, every hour since the month of March,\r\nand therefore always thought that by putting off writing to you a few\r\ndays, my letter, while it should communicate the occurrences of the day,\r\nmight be a letter of adieu. Should my permission now arrive, I should\r\nput off my departure till after the equinox. They write me that my not\r\nreceiving it, has proceeded from the ceasing of the old government in\r\nOctober last, and the organization of the higher departments in the new,\r\nwhich had not yet taken place when my last letters came away. Bills had\r\nbeen brought in for establishing departments of Foreign Affairs, Finance,\r\nand War. The last would certainly be given to General Knox. Mr. Jay would\r\nprobably have his choice of the first and second; and it is supposed\r\nHamilton would have that which Mr. Jay declined. Some thought Mr. Jay\r\nwould prefer and obtain the head of the law department, for which Wilson\r\nwould be a competitor. In such a case; some have supposed C. Thompson\r\nwould ask the Foreign Affairs. The Senate and Representatives differed\r\nabout the title of the President. The former wanted to style him \"His\r\nHighness, George Washington, President of the United States, and Protector\r\nof their liberties.\" The latter insisted and prevailed, to give no title\r\nbut that of office, to wit, \"George Washington, President of the United\r\nStates.\" I hope the terms of Excellency, Honor, Worship, Esquire, forever\r\ndisappear from among us, from that moment: I wish that of Mr. would follow\r\nthem. In the impost bill, the Representatives had, by almost an unanimous\r\nconcurrence, made a difference between nations in treaty with us, and\r\nthose not in treaty. The Senate had struck out this difference and lowered\r\nall the duties. Quære, whether the Representatives would yield? Congress\r\nwere to proceed about the 1st of June to propose amendments to the new\r\nConstitution. The principal would be, the annexing a declaration of rights\r\nto satisfy the mind of all, on the subject of their liberties. They waited\r\nthe arrival of Brown, delegate from Kentucky, to take up the receiving\r\nthat district as a fourteenth State. The only objections apprehended,\r\nwere from the partisans of Vermont, who might insist on both coming in\r\ntogether. This would produce a delay, though probably not a long one.\r\n\r\nTo detail to you the events of this country, would require a volume. It\r\nwould be useless too; because those given in the Leyden gazette, though\r\nnot universally true, have so few and such unimportant errors mixed with\r\nthem, that you may have a general faith in them. I will rather give you,\r\ntherefore, what that paper cannot give, the views of the prevailing power,\r\nas far as they can be collected from conversation and writings. They\r\nwill distribute the powers of government into three parts, legislative,\r\njudiciary, and executive. The legislative will certainly have no\r\nhereditary branch, and probably not even a select one (like our Senate).\r\nIf they divide it into two chambers at all, it will be by breaking the\r\nrepresentative body into two equal halves by lot. But very many are\r\nfor a single House, and particularly the Turgotists. The imperfection\r\nof their legislative body, I think, will be, that not a member of it\r\nwill be chosen by the people directly. Their representation will be an\r\nequal one, in which every man will elect and be elected as a citizen,\r\nnot as of a distinct order. Quære, whether they will elect placemen and\r\npensioners? Their legislature will meet periodically, and set at their\r\nown will, with a power in the executive to call them extraordinarily,\r\nin case of emergencies. There is a considerable division of sentiment\r\nwhether the executive shall have a negative on the laws. I think they will\r\ndetermine to give such a negative, either absolute or qualified. In the\r\njudiciary, the parliaments will be suppressed, less numerous judiciary\r\nbodies instituted, and trial by jury established in criminal, if not\r\nin civil cases. The executive power will be left entire in the hands of\r\nthe King. They will establish the responsibility of ministers, gifts and\r\nappropriations of money by the National Assembly alone; consequently,\r\na civil list, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, freedom of\r\ncommerce and industry, freedom of person against arbitrary arrests, and\r\nmodifications, if not a total prohibition of military agency in civil\r\ncases. I do not see how they can prohibit altogether the aid of the\r\nmilitary in cases of riot, and yet I doubt whether they can descend from\r\nthe sublimity of ancient military pride, to let a Marechal of France\r\nwith his troops, be commanded by a Magistrate. They cannot conceive, that\r\nGeneral Washington, at the head of his army, during the late war, could\r\nhave been commanded by a common Constable to go as his _posse comitatus_,\r\nto suppress a mob, and that Count Rochambeau, when he was arrested at the\r\nhead of his army by a sheriff, must have gone to jail if he had not given\r\nbail to appear in court. Though they have gone astonishing lengths, they\r\nare not yet thus far. It is probable, therefore, that not knowing how to\r\nuse the military as a civil weapon, they will do too much or too little\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nI have said that things will be so and so. Understand by this, that these\r\nare only my conjectures, the plan of the constitution not being proposed\r\nyet, much less agreed to. Tranquillity is pretty well established in\r\nthe capital; though the appearance of any of the refugees here would\r\nendanger it. The Baron de Besenval is kept away; so is M. de la Vauguyon.\r\nThe latter was so short a time a member of the obnoxious administration,\r\nthat probably he might not be touched were he here. Seven Princes of the\r\nhouse of Bourbon, and seven ministers, fled into foreign countries, is a\r\nwonderful event indeed.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect and attachment, dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                    Paris, August 27, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,--I am honored with your favor of June the 19th, informing me that\r\npermission is given me to make a short visit to my native country, for\r\nwhich indulgence I beg leave to return my thanks to the President, and\r\nto yourself, Sir, for the expedition with which you were so good as to\r\nforward it, after it was obtained. Being advised that October is the\r\nbest month of the autumn for a passage to America, I shall wish to sail\r\nabout the first of that month; and as I have a family with me, and their\r\nbaggage is considerable, I must endeavor to find a vessel bound directly\r\nfor Virginia, if possible.\r\n\r\nMy last letters to you have been of the 5th and 12th instant. Since these,\r\nI received information from our bankers in Holland, that they had money\r\nin hand sufficient to answer the demands for the foreign officers, and for\r\nthe captives; and that moreover, the residue of the bonds of the last loan\r\nwere engaged. I hereupon wrote to Mr. Grand for an exact estimate of the\r\nsum necessary for the officers. He had stated it to me as being forty-five\r\nthousand six hundred and fifty-two livres eleven sous six deniers, a\r\nyear, when I was going to Holland to propose the loan to Mr. Adams, and\r\nat that sum, you will see it was stated in the estimate we sent you from\r\nAmsterdam. He now informed me it was sixty thousand three hundred and\r\nninety-three livres seventeen sous ten deniers, a year. I called on him\r\nfor an explanation. He showed me that his first information agreed with\r\nthe only list of the officers and sums then in his possession, and his\r\nlast with a new list lately sent from the treasury board in which other\r\nofficers were set down, who had been omitted in the first. I wrote to\r\nour bankers an account of this error, and desired to know whether, after\r\nreserving the money necessary for the captives, they were in condition to\r\nfurnish two hundred and fifty-four thousand livres for the officers. They\r\nanswered me by sending the money, and the additional sum of twenty-six\r\nthousand livres, to complete the business of the medals. I delivered the\r\nbills to Messrs. Grand and company, to negotiate and pay away; and the\r\narrears to the officers to the first day of the present year, are now in\r\na course of payment. While on this subject, I will ask that an order may\r\nbe forwarded to the bankers in Holland to furnish, and to Mr. Grand to\r\npay, the arrearages which may be due on the first of January next. The\r\nmoney being in hand, it would be a pity that we should fail in payment\r\na single day, merely for want of an order. The bankers further give it\r\nas their opinion, that our credit is so much advanced on the exchange of\r\nAmsterdam, that we may probably execute any money arrangements we may have\r\noccasion for, on this side the water. I have the honor to send you a copy\r\nof their letter. They have communicated to me apprehensions, that another\r\nhouse was endeavoring to obtain the business of our government. Knowing\r\nof no such endeavors myself, I have assured them that I am a stranger to\r\nany applications on the subject. At the same time, I cannot but suspect\r\nthat this jealousy has been one of the spurs, at least, to the prompt\r\ncompletion of our loan. The spirited proceedings of the new Congress in\r\nthe business of revenue, has doubtless been the principal one.\r\n\r\nAn engagement has taken place between the Russian and Swedish fleets in\r\nthe Baltic, which has been not at all decisive, no ship having been lost\r\non either side. The Swedes claim a victory, because they remained in the\r\nfield till the Russians quitted it. The latter effected a junction soon\r\nafter with another part of their fleet, and being now about ten ships\r\nstrongest, the Swedes retired into port, and it is imagined they will\r\nnot appear again under so great disparity; so that the campaign by sea\r\nis supposed to be finished. Their commerce will be at the mercy of their\r\nenemies; but they have put it out of the power of the Russians to send\r\nany fleet to the Mediterranean this year.\r\n\r\nA revolution has been effected very suddenly in the bishopric of Liege.\r\nTheir constitution had been changed by force, by the reigning sovereign,\r\nabout one hundred years ago. This subject had been lately revived\r\nand discussed in print. The people were at length excited to assemble\r\ntumultuously. They sent for their Prince, who was at his country seat, and\r\nrequired him to come to the town house to hear their grievances. Though\r\nin the night, he came instantly and was obliged to sign a restitution of\r\ntheir ancient constitution, which took place on the spot, and all became\r\nquiet without a drop of blood spilt. This fact is worthy notice, only as\r\nit shows the progress of the spirit of revolution.\r\n\r\nNo act of violence has taken place in Paris since my last, except on\r\naccount of the difference between the French and Swiss guards, which gave\r\nrise to occasional single combats, in which five or six were killed.\r\nThe difference is made up. Some misunderstandings had arisen between\r\nthe committees of the different districts of Paris, as to the form of\r\nthe future municipal government. These gave uneasiness for awhile, but\r\nhave been also reconciled. Still there is such a leaven of fermentation\r\nremaining in the body of the people, that acts of violence are always\r\npossible, and are quite unpunishable; there being, as yet, no judicature\r\nwhich can venture to act in any case, however small or great. The country\r\nis becoming more calm. The embarrassments of the government, for want of\r\nmoney, are extreme. The loan of thirty millions proposed by Mr. Neckar,\r\nhas not succeeded at all. No taxes are paid. A total stoppage of all\r\npayment to the creditors of the State is possible every moment. These\r\nform a great mass in the city as well as country, and among the lower\r\nclass of people too, who have been used to carry their little savings of\r\ntheir service into the public funds upon life rents of five, ten, twenty\r\nguineas a year, and many of whom have no other dependence for daily\r\nsubsistence. A prodigious number of servants are now also thrown out of\r\nemploy by domestic reforms, rendered necessary by the late events. Add\r\nto this, the want of bread, which is extreme. For several days past, a\r\nconsiderable proportion of the people have been without bread altogether;\r\nfor though the new harvest is begun, there is neither water nor wind to\r\ngrind the grain. For some days past the people have besieged the doors\r\nof the bakers, scrambled with one another for bread, collected in squads\r\nall over the city, and need only some slight incident to lead them to\r\nexcesses which may end in, nobody can tell what. The danger from the want\r\nof bread, however, which is the most imminent, will certainly lessen in\r\na few days. What turn that may take which arises from the want of money,\r\nis difficult to be foreseen. Mr. Neckar is totally without influence in\r\nthe National Assembly, and is, I believe, not satisfied with this want\r\nof importance. That Assembly has just finished their bill of rights. The\r\nquestion will then be, whether to take up first the constitution or the\r\nbusiness of finance.\r\n\r\nNo plan of a constitution has been yet given in. But I can state to\r\nyou the outlines of what the leading members have in contemplation.\r\nThe executive power in a hereditary King, with power of dissolving the\r\nlegislature, and a negative on their laws; his authority in forming\r\ntreaties to be greatly restrained. The legislative to be a single House\r\nof representatives, chosen for two or three years. They propose a body\r\nwhom they call a Senate, to be chosen by the Provincial Assemblies, as our\r\nfederal Senate is, but with no power of negativing or amending laws; they\r\nmay only remonstrate on them to the representatives, who will decide by a\r\nsimple majority the ultimate event of the law. This body will therefore be\r\na mere council of revision. It is proposed that they shall be of a certain\r\nage and property, and be for life. They may make them also their court of\r\nimpeachment. They will suppress the parliaments, and establish a system of\r\njudicature somewhat like that of England, with trial by jury in criminal\r\ncases, perhaps also in civil. Each province will have a subordinate\r\nprovincial government, and the great cities, a municipal one on a free\r\nbasis. These are the ideas and views of the most distinguished members.\r\nBut they may suffer great modifications from the Assembly, and the longer\r\nthe delay, the greater will be the modifications. Considerable interval\r\nhaving taken place since any popular execution, the aristocratic party is\r\nraising its head. They are strengthened by a considerable defection from\r\nthe patriots, in consequence of the general suppression of the abuses of\r\nthe 4th of August, in which many were interested. Another faction too, of\r\nthe most desperate views, has acquired strength in the Assembly, as well\r\nas out of it. These wish to dethrone the reigning branch, and transfer\r\nthe crown to the Duke d'Orleans. The members of this faction are mostly\r\npersons of wicked and desperate fortunes, who have nothing at heart\r\nbut to pillage from the wreck of their country. The Duke himself is as\r\nunprincipled as his followers; sunk in debaucheries of the lowest kind,\r\nand incapable of quitting them for business; not a fool, yet not head\r\nenough to conduct anything. In fact, I suppose him used merely as a tool,\r\nbecause of his immense wealth, and that he acquired a certain degree of\r\npopularity by his first opposition to the government, then credited to\r\nhim as upon virtuous motives. He is certainly borrowing money on a large\r\nscale. He is in understanding with the court of London, where he had been\r\nlong in habits of intimacy. The ministry here are apprehensive, that that\r\nministry will support his designs by war. I have no idea of this, but no\r\ndoubt, at the same time, that they will furnish him money liberally to\r\naliment a civil war, and prevent the regeneration of this country.\r\n\r\nIt was suggested to me, some days ago, that the court of Versailles\r\nwere treating with that of London, for a surrender of their West India\r\npossessions, in consideration of a great sum of money to relieve their\r\npresent distress. Every principle of common sense was in opposition\r\nto this fact; yet it was so affirmed as to merit inquiry. I became\r\nsatisfied the government had never such an idea; but that the story\r\nwas not without foundation altogether; that something like this was in\r\ncontemplation between the faction of Orleans and the court of London,\r\nas a means of obtaining money from that court. In a conversation with\r\nthe Count de Montmorin, two days ago, he told me their colonies were\r\nspeaking a language which gave them uneasiness, and for which there\r\nwas no foundation. I asked him if he knew anything of what I have just\r\nmentioned. He appeared unapprized of it, but to see at once that it would\r\nbe a probable speculation between two parties circumstanced and principled\r\nas those two are. I apologized to him for the inquiries I had made into\r\nthis business, by observing that it would be much against our interest,\r\nthat any one power should monopolize all the West India islands. \"Parde,\r\nassurement,\" was his answer.\r\n\r\nThe _emancipation_ of their islands is an idea prevailing in the minds\r\nof several members of the National Assembly, particularly those most\r\nenlightened and most liberal in their views. Such a step by this country\r\nwould lead to other emancipations or revolutions in the same quarter. I\r\nenclose you some papers received from Mr. Carmichael, relative to the\r\ncapture of one of our vessels by a Morocco cruiser, and restitution\r\nby the Emperor. I shall immediately write to M. Chiappe, to express a\r\nproper sense of the Emperor's friendly dispositions to us. I forward\r\nalso the public papers to the present date; and have the honor to be,\r\nwith sentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                    Paris, August 28, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--My last to you was of July the 22d. Since that, I have received\r\nyours of May the 27th, June 13th and 30th. The tranquillity of the city\r\nhas not been disturbed since my last. Dissensions between the French and\r\nSwiss guards occasioned some private combats, in which five or six were\r\nkilled. These dissensions are made up. The want of bread for some days\r\npast, has greatly endangered the peace of the city. Some get a little,\r\nsome none at all. The poor are the best served, because they besiege\r\nperpetually the doors of the bakers. Notwithstanding this distress, and\r\nthe palpable importance of the city administration to furnish bread to\r\nthe city, it was not till yesterday, that general leave was given to the\r\nbakers to go into the country and buy flour for themselves as they can.\r\nThis will soon relieve us, because the wheat harvest is well advanced.\r\nNever was there a country where the practice of governing too much, had\r\ntaken deeper root and done more mischief. Their declaration of rights\r\nis finished. If printed in time, I will enclose a copy with this. It is\r\ndoubtful whether they will now take up the finance or the constitution\r\nfirst. The distress for money endangers everything. No taxes are paid, and\r\nno money can be borrowed. Mr. Neckar was yesterday to give in a memoir\r\nto the Assembly, on this subject. I think they will give him leave to\r\nput into execution any plan he pleases, so as to debarrass themselves\r\nof this, and take up that of the constitution. No plan is yet reported;\r\nbut the leading members (with some small difference of opinion) have in\r\ncontemplation the following: The executive power in a hereditary King,\r\nwith a negative on laws, and power to dissolve the legislature; to be\r\nconsiderably restrained in the making of treaties, and limited in his\r\nexpenses. The legislative is a House of representatives. They propose a\r\nSenate also, chosen on the plan of our federal Senate by the Provincial\r\nAssemblies, but to be for life, of a certain age (they talk of forty\r\nyears), and certain wealth (four or five hundred guineas a year), but\r\nto have no other power against the laws but to remonstrate against them\r\nto the representatives, who will then determine their fate by a simple\r\nmajority. This, you will readily perceive, is a mere council of revision,\r\nlike that of New York, which, in order to be something, must form an\r\nalliance with the King, to avail themselves of his veto. The alliance will\r\nbe useful to both, and to the nation. The representatives to be chosen\r\nevery two or three years. The judiciary system is less prepared than any\r\nother part of the plan; however, they will abolish the parliaments, and\r\nestablish an order of judges and justices, general and provincial, a good\r\ndeal like ours, with trial by jury in criminal cases certainly, perhaps\r\nalso in civil. The provinces will have Assemblies for their provincial\r\ngovernment, and the cities a municipal body for municipal government, all\r\nfounded on the basis of popular election. These subordinate governments,\r\nthough completely dependent on the general one, will be intrusted with\r\nalmost the whole of the details which our State governments exercise.\r\nThey will have their own judiciary, final in all but great cases, the\r\nexecutive business will principally pass through their hands, and a\r\ncertain local legislature will be allowed them. In short, ours has been\r\nprofessedly their model, in which such changes are made as a difference\r\nof circumstances rendered necessary, and some others neither necessary nor\r\nadvantageous, but into which men will ever run, when versed in theory and\r\nnew in the practice of government, when acquainted with man only as they\r\nsee him in their books and not in the world. This plan will undoubtedly\r\nundergo changes in the Assembly, and the longer it is delayed, the greater\r\nwill be the changes; for that Assembly, or rather the patriotic part of\r\nit, hooped together heretofore by a common enemy, are less compact since\r\ntheir victory. That enemy (the civil and ecclesiastical aristocracy)\r\nbegins to raise its head. The lees, too, of the patriotic party, of\r\nwicked principles and desperate fortunes, hoping to pillage something\r\nin the wreck of their country, are attaching themselves to the faction\r\nof the Duke of Orleans; that faction is caballing with the populace, and\r\nintriguing at London, the Hague, and Berlin, and have evidently in view\r\nthe transfer of the crown to the Duke of Orleans. He is a man of moderate\r\nunderstanding, of no principle, absorbed in low vice, and incapable of\r\nextracting himself from the filth of that, to direct anything else. His\r\nname and his money, therefore, are mere tools in the hands of those who\r\nare duping him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey may produce a temporary confusion, and even a temporary civil war,\r\nsupported, as they will be, by the money of England; but they cannot have\r\nsuccess ultimately. The King, the mass of the substantial people of the\r\nwhole country, the army, and the influential part of the clergy, form a\r\nfirm phalanx which must prevail. Should those delays which necessarily\r\nattend the deliberations of a body of one thousand two hundred men, give\r\ntime to this plot to ripen and burst, so as to break up the Assembly\r\nbefore anything definite is done, a constitution, the principles of which\r\nare pretty well settled in the minds of the Assembly, will be proposed by\r\nthe national militia (* * * * *), urged by the individual members of the\r\nAssembly, signed by the King, and supported by the nation, to prevail till\r\ncircumstances shall permit its revision and more regular sanction. This I\r\nsuppose the _pis aller_ of their affairs, while their probable event is\r\na peaceable settlement of them. They fear a war from England, Holland,\r\nand Prussia. I think England will give money, but not make war. Holland\r\nwould soon be a fire, internally, were she to be embroiled in external\r\ndifficulties. Prussia must know this, and act accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to desire better dispositions towards us than prevail\r\nin this Assembly. Our proceedings have been viewed as a model for them\r\non every occasion; and though in the heat of debate, men are generally\r\ndisposed to contradict every authority urged by their opponents, ours\r\nhas been treated like that of the Bible, open to explanation, but not to\r\nquestion. I am sorry that in the moment of such a disposition, anything\r\nshould come from us to check it. The placing them on a mere footing with\r\nthe English, will have this effect. When of two nations, the one has\r\nengaged herself in a ruinous war for us, has spent her blood and money to\r\nsave us, has opened her bosom to us in peace, and received us almost on\r\nthe footing of her own citizens, while the other has moved heaven, earth,\r\nand hell to exterminate us in war, has insulted us in all her councils in\r\npeace, shut her doors to us in every part where her interests would admit\r\nit, libelled us in foreign nations, endeavored to poison them against the\r\nreception of our most precious commodities; to place these two nations on\r\na footing, is to give a great deal more to one than to the other, if the\r\nmaxim be true, that to make unequal quantities equal, you must add more to\r\none than the other. To say, in excuse, that gratitude is never to enter\r\ninto the motives of national conduct, is to revive a principle which has\r\nbeen buried for centuries with its kindred principles of the lawfulness\r\nof assassination, poison, perjury, &c. All of these were legitimate\r\nprinciples in the dark ages which intervened between ancient and modern\r\ncivilization, but exploded and held in just horror in the eighteenth\r\ncentury. I know but one code of morality for men, whether acting singly\r\nor collectively. He who says I will be a rogue when I act in company with\r\na hundred others, but an honest man when I act alone, will be believed in\r\nthe former assertion, but not in the latter. I would say with the poet,\r\n\"_hic niger est, hunc tu Romane cavato_.\" If the morality of one man\r\nproduces a just line of conduct in him, acting individually, why should\r\nnot the morality of one hundred men produce a just line of conduct in\r\nthem, acting together? But I indulge myself in these reflections, because\r\nmy own feelings run me into them; with you they were always acknowledged.\r\nLet us hope that our new government will take some other occasions to\r\nshow, that they mean to proscribe no virtue from the canons of their\r\nconduct with other nations. In every other instance, the new government\r\nhas ushered itself to the world as honest, masculine, and dignified. It\r\nhas shown genuine dignity, in my opinion, in exploding adulatory titles;\r\nthey are the offerings of abject baseness, and nourish that degrading vice\r\nin the people.\r\n\r\nI must now say a word on the declaration of rights, you have been so good\r\nas to send me. I like it, as far as it goes; but I should have been for\r\ngoing further. For instance, the following alterations and additions would\r\nhave pleased me. Article 4. \"The people shall not be deprived of their\r\nright to speak, to write, or _otherwise_ to publish anything but false\r\nfacts affecting injuriously the life, liberty, property or reputation of\r\nothers, or affecting the peace of the confederacy with foreign nations.\r\nArticle 7. All facts put in issue before any judicature, shall be tried by\r\njury, except, 1, in cases of admiralty jurisdiction, wherein a foreigner\r\nshall be interested; 2, in cases cognizable before a court martial,\r\nconcerning only the regular officers and soldiers of the United States, or\r\nmembers of the militia in actual service in time of war or insurrection;\r\nand 3, in impeachments allowed by the constitution. Article 8. No person\r\nshall be held in confinement more than ---- days after he shall have\r\ndemanded and been refused a writ of habeas corpus by the judge appointed\r\nby law, nor more than ---- days after such a writ shall have been served\r\non the person holding him in confinement, and no order given on due\r\nexamination for his remandment or discharge, nor more than ---- hours in\r\nany place at a greater distance than ---- miles from the usual residence\r\nof some judge authorized to issue the writ of habeas corpus; nor shall\r\nthat writ be suspended for any term exceeding one year, nor in any place\r\nmore than ---- miles distant from the State or encampment of enemies or\r\nof insurgents. Article 9. Monopolies may be allowed to persons for their\r\nown productions in literature, and their own inventions in the arts, for\r\na term not exceeding ---- years, but for no longer term, and no other\r\npurpose. Article 10. All troops of the United States shall stand _ipso\r\nfacto_ disbanded, at the expiration of the term for which their pay and\r\nsubsistence shall have been last voted by Congress, and all officers and\r\nsoldiers, not natives of the United States, shall be incapable of serving\r\nin their armies by land, except during a foreign war.\" These restrictions\r\nI think are so guarded, as to hinder evil only. However, if we do not have\r\nthem now, I have so much confidence in my countrymen, as to be satisfied\r\nthat we shall have them as soon as the degeneracy of our government shall\r\nrender them necessary.\r\n\r\nI have no certain news of Paul Jones. I understand only, in a general\r\nway, that some persecution on the part of his officers occasioned his\r\nbeing called to St. Petersburg, and that though protected against them\r\nby the Empress, he is not yet restored to his station. Silas Deane\r\nis coming over to finish his days in America, not having one sous to\r\nsubsist on, elsewhere. He is a wretched monument of the consequences of\r\na departure from right. I will, before my departure, write Colonel Lee\r\nfully the measures I have pursued to procure success in his business,\r\nand which as yet offer little hope; and I shall leave it in the hands\r\nof Mr. Short to be pursued, if any prospect opens on him. I propose to\r\nsail from Havre as soon after the first of October as I can get a vessel;\r\nand shall consequently leave this place a week earlier than that. As my\r\ndaughters will be with me, and their baggage somewhat more than that of\r\nmere _voyageures_, I shall endeavor, if possible, to obtain a passage for\r\nVirginia directly. Probably I shall be there by the last of November. If\r\nmy immediate attendance at New York should be requisite for any purpose,\r\nI will leave them with a relation near Richmond, and proceed immediately\r\nto New York. But as I do not foresee any pressing purpose for that\r\njourney immediately on my arrival, and as it will be a great saving of\r\ntime, to finish at once in Virginia, so as to have no occasion to return\r\nthere after having once gone to the northward, I expect to proceed to\r\nmy own house directly. Staying there two months (which I believe will be\r\nnecessary), and allowing for the time I am on the road, I may expect to be\r\nat New York in February, and to embark from thence or some eastern port.\r\n\r\nYou ask me if I would accept any appointment on that side of the water?\r\nYou know the circumstances which led me from retirement, step by step, and\r\nfrom one nomination to another, up to the present. My object is a return\r\nto the same retirement; whenever, therefore, I quit the present, it will\r\nnot be to engage in any other office, and most especially any one which\r\nwould require a constant residence from home. The books I have collected\r\nfor you will go off for Havre in three or four days, with my baggage. From\r\nthat port, I shall try to send them by a direct occasion to New York. I\r\nam, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your affectionate friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\nP. S. I just now learn that Mr. Neckar proposed yesterday to the National\r\nAssembly a loan of eighty millions, on terms more tempting to the lender\r\nthan the former, and that they approved it, leaving him to arrange the\r\ndetails, in order that they might occupy themselves at once about to the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                  Paris, September 6, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I sit down to write to you without knowing by what occasion I\r\nshall send my letter. I do it, because a subject comes into my head, which\r\nI would wish to develop a little more than is practicable in the hurry of\r\nthe moment of making up general despatches.\r\n\r\nThe question, whether one generation of men has a right to bind another,\r\nseems never to have been started either on this or our side of the water.\r\nYet it is a question of such consequences as not only to merit decision,\r\nbut place also among the fundamental principles of every government. The\r\ncourse of reflection in which we are immersed here, on the elementary\r\nprinciples of society, has presented this question to my mind; and that no\r\nsuch obligation can be transmitted, I think very capable of proof. I set\r\nout on this ground, which I suppose to be self-evident, that the _earth\r\nbelongs in usufruct to the living_; that the dead have neither powers nor\r\nrights over it. The portion occupied by any individual ceases to be his\r\nwhen himself ceases to be, and reverts to the society. If the society\r\nhas formed no rules for the appropriation of its lands in severality,\r\nit will be taken by the first occupants, and these will generally be\r\nthe wife and children of the decedent. If they have formed rules of\r\nappropriation, those rules may give it to the wife and children, or to\r\nsome one of them, or to the legatee of the deceased. So they may give it\r\nto its creditor. But the child, the legatee or creditor, takes it, not by\r\nnatural right, but by a law of the society of which he is a member, and\r\nto which he is subject. Then, no man can, by _natural right_, oblige the\r\nlands he occupied, or the persons who succeed him in that occupation, to\r\nthe payment of debts contracted by him. For if he could, he might during\r\nhis own life, eat up the usufruct of the lands for several generations to\r\ncome; and then the lands would belong to the dead, and not to the living,\r\nwhich is the reverse of our principle.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of every member of the society, individually, is true of\r\nthem all collectively; since the rights of the whole can be no more than\r\nthe sum of the rights of the individuals. To keep our ideas clear when\r\napplying them to a multitude, let us suppose a whole generation of men\r\nto be born on the same day, to attain mature age on the same day, and to\r\ndie on the same day, leaving a succeeding generation in the moment of\r\nattaining their mature age, all together. Let the ripe age be supposed\r\nof twenty-one years, and their period of life thirty-four years more,\r\nthat being the average term given by the bills of mortality to persons of\r\ntwenty-one years of age. Each successive generation would, in this way,\r\ncome and go off the stage at a fixed moment, as individuals do now. Then\r\nI say, the earth belongs to each of these generations during its course,\r\nfully and in its own right. The second generation receives it clear of\r\nthe debts and incumbrances of the first, the third of the second, and so\r\non. For if the first could charge it with a debt, then the earth would\r\nbelong to the dead and not to the living generation. Then, no generation\r\ncan contract debts greater than maybe paid during the course of its own\r\nexistence. At twenty-one years of age, they may bind themselves and their\r\nlands for thirty-four years to come; at twenty-two, for thirty-three;\r\nat twenty-three, for thirty-two; and at fifty-four, for one year only;\r\nbecause these are the terms of life which remain to them at the respective\r\nepochs. But a material difference must be noted, between the succession of\r\nan individual and that of a whole generation. Individuals are parts only\r\nof a society, subject to the laws of a whole. These laws may appropriate\r\nthe portion of land occupied by a decedent, to his creditor, rather than\r\nto any other, or to his child, on condition he satisfies the creditor.\r\nBut when a whole generation, that is, the whole society, dies, as in the\r\ncase we have supposed, and another generation or society succeeds, this\r\nforms a whole, and there is no superior who can give their territory to\r\na third society, who may have lent money to their predecessors, beyond\r\ntheir faculties of paying.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of generations succeeding one another at fixed epochs,\r\nas has been supposed for clearer conception, is true for those renewed\r\ndaily, as in the actual course of nature. As a majority of the contracting\r\ngeneration will continue in being thirty-four years, and a new majority\r\nwill then come into possession, the former may extend their engagement\r\nto that term, and no longer. The conclusion then, is, that neither the\r\nrepresentatives of a nation, nor the whole nation itself assembled, can\r\nvalidly engage debts beyond what they may pay in their own time, that is\r\nto say, within thirty-four years of the date of the engagement.\r\n\r\nTo render this conclusion palpable, suppose that Louis the XIV. and XV.\r\nhad contracted debts in the name of the French nation, to the amount of\r\nten thousand milliards, and that the whole had been contracted in Holland.\r\nThe interest of this sum would be five hundred milliards, which is the\r\nwhole rent-roll or net proceeds of the territory of France. Must the\r\npresent generation of men have retired from the territory in which nature\r\nproduces them, and ceded it to the Dutch creditors? No; they have the\r\nsame rights over the soil on which they were produced, as the preceding\r\ngenerations had. They derive these rights not from them, but from nature.\r\nThey, then, and their soil are, by nature, clear of the debts of their\r\npredecessors. To present this in another point of view, suppose Louis XV.\r\nand his cotemporary generation, had said to the money lenders of Holland,\r\ngive us money, that we may eat, drink, and be merry in our day; and on\r\ncondition you will demand no interest till the end of thirty-four years,\r\nyou shall then, forever after, receive an annual interest of fifteen per\r\ncent. The money is lent on these conditions, is divided among the people,\r\neaten, drunk, and squandered. Would the present generation be obliged\r\nto apply the produce of the earth and of their labor, to replace their\r\ndissipations? Not at all.\r\n\r\nI suppose that the received opinion, that the public debts of one\r\ngeneration devolve on the next, has been suggested by our seeing,\r\nhabitually, in private life, that he who succeeds to lands is required\r\nto pay the debts of his predecessor; without considering that this\r\nrequisition is municipal only, not moral, flowing from the will of the\r\nsociety, which has found it convenient to appropriate the lands of a\r\ndecedent on the condition of a payment of his debts; but that between\r\nsociety and society, or generation and generation, there is no municipal\r\nobligation, no umpire but the law of nature.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the national debt of France being, in fact, but a two\r\nthousandth part of its rent-roll, the payment of it is practicable enough;\r\nand so becomes a question merely of honor or of expediency. But with\r\nrespect to future debts, would it not be wise and just for that nation to\r\ndeclare in the constitution they are forming, that neither the legislature\r\nnor the nation itself, can validly contract more debt than they may pay\r\nwithin their own age, or within the term of thirty-four years? And that\r\nall future contracts shall be deemed void, as to what shall remain unpaid\r\nat the end of thirty-four years from their date? This would put the\r\nlenders, and the borrowers also, on their guard. By reducing, too, the\r\nfaculty of borrowing within its natural limits, it would bridle the spirit\r\nof war, to which too free a course has been procured by the inattention\r\nof money lenders to this law of nature, that succeeding generations are\r\nnot responsible for the preceding.\r\n\r\nOn similar ground it may be proved, that no society can make a perpetual\r\nconstitution, or even a perpetual law. The earth belongs always to the\r\nliving generation: they may manage it, then, and what proceeds from it,\r\nas they please, during their usufruct. They are masters, too, of their own\r\npersons, and consequently may govern them as they please. But persons and\r\nproperty make the sum of the objects of government. The constitution and\r\nthe laws of their predecessors are extinguished then, in their natural\r\ncourse, with those whose will gave them being. This could preserve that\r\nbeing, till it ceased to be itself, and no longer. Every constitution,\r\nthen, and every law, naturally expires at the end of thirty-four years.\r\nIf it be enforced longer, it is an act of force, and not of right. It may\r\nbe said, that the succeeding generation exercising, in fact, the power\r\nof repeal, this leaves them as free as if the constitution or law had\r\nbeen expressly limited to thirty-four years only. In the first place,\r\nthis objection admits the right, in proposing an equivalent. But the\r\npower of repeal is not an equivalent. It might be, indeed, if every form\r\nof government were so perfectly contrived, that the will of the majority\r\ncould always be obtained, fairly and without impediment. But this is true\r\nof no form. The people cannot assemble themselves; their representation\r\nis unequal and vicious. Various checks are opposed to every legislative\r\nproposition. Factions get possession of the public councils, bribery\r\ncorrupts them, personal interests lead them astray from the general\r\ninterests of their constituents; and other impediments arise, so as to\r\nprove to every practical man, that a law of limited duration is much more\r\nmanageable than one which needs a repeal.\r\n\r\nThis principle, that the earth belongs to the living and not to the dead,\r\nis of very extensive application and consequences in every country, and\r\nmost especially in France. It enters into the resolution of the questions,\r\nwhether the nation may change the descent of lands holden in tail; whether\r\nthey may change the appropriation of lands given anciently to the church,\r\nto hospitals, colleges, orders of chivalry, and otherwise in perpetuity;\r\nwhether they may abolish the charges and privileges attached on lands,\r\nincluding the whole catalogue, ecclesiastical and feudal; it goes to\r\nhereditary offices, authorities and jurisdictions, to hereditary orders,\r\ndistinctions and appellations, to perpetual monopolies in commerce, the\r\narts or sciences, with a long train of _et ceteras_; and it renders the\r\nquestion of reimbursement, a question of generosity and not of right.\r\nIn all these cases, the legislature of the day could authorize such\r\nappropriations and establishments for their own time, but no longer; and\r\nthe present holders, even where they or their ancestors have purchased,\r\nare in the case of _bona fide_ purchasers of what the seller had no right\r\nconvey.\r\n\r\nTurn this subject in your mind, my dear Sir, and particularly as to the\r\npower of contracting debts, and develop it with that cogent logic which\r\nis so peculiarly yours. Your station in the councils of our country gives\r\nyou an opportunity of producing it to public consideration, of forcing it\r\ninto discussion. At first blush it may be laughed at, as the dream of a\r\ntheorist; but examination will prove it to be solid and salutary. It would\r\nfurnish matter for a fine preamble to our first law for appropriating\r\nthe public revenue; and it will exclude, at the threshold of our new\r\ngovernment, the ruinous and contagious errors of this quarter of the\r\nglobe, which have armed despots with means which nature does not sanction,\r\nfor binding in chains their fellow-men. We have already given, in example,\r\none effectual check to the dog of war, by transferring the power of\r\ndeclaring war from the executive to the legislative body, from those who\r\nare to spend, to those who are to pay. I should be pleased to see this\r\nsecond obstacle held out by us also, in the first instance. No nation\r\ncan make a declaration against the validity of long-contracted debts,\r\nso disinterestedly as we, since we do not owe a shilling which will not\r\nbe paid, principal and interest, by the measures you have taken, within\r\nthe time of our own lives. I write you no news, because when an occasion\r\noccurs, I shall write a separate letter for that.\r\n\r\nI am always, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your affectionate\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. GEM.\r\n\r\nThe hurry in which I wrote my letter to Mr. Madison, which is in your\r\nhands, occasioned an inattention to the difference between generations\r\nsucceeding each other at fixed epochs, and generations renewed daily\r\nand hourly. It is true that in the former case, the generation when\r\nat twenty-one years of age, may contract a debt for thirty-four years,\r\nbecause a majority of them will live so long. But a generation consisting\r\nof all ages, and which legislates by all its members above the age of\r\ntwenty-one years, cannot contract for so long a time, because their\r\nmajority will be dead much sooner. Buffon gives us a table of twenty-three\r\nthousand nine hundred and ninety-four deaths, stating the ages at which\r\nthey happened. To draw from these the result I have occasion for,\r\nI suppose a society in which twenty-three thousand nine hundred and\r\nninety-four persons are born every year, and live to the age stated\r\nin Buffon's table. Then, the following inferences may be drawn. Such a\r\nsociety will consist constantly of six hundred and seventeen thousand\r\nseven hundred and three persons, of all ages. Of those living at any one\r\ninstant of time, one half will be dead in twenty-four years and eight\r\nmonths. In such a society, ten thousand six hundred and seventy-five,\r\nwill arrive every year at the age of twenty-one years complete. It will\r\nconstantly have three hundred and forty-eight thousand four hundred and\r\nseventeen persons of all ages above twenty-one years, and the half of\r\nthose of twenty-one years and upwards living at any one instant of time,\r\nwill be dead in eighteen years and eight months, or say nineteen years.\r\n\r\nThen, the contracts, constitutions and laws of every such society become\r\nvoid in nineteen years from their date.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. RUTLEDGE.\r\n\r\n                                                 Paris, September 18, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I have duly received your favor by Mr. Cutting, enclosing the\r\npaper from Doctor Trumbull, for which I am very thankful. The conjecture\r\nthat inhabitants may have been carried from the coast of Africa to that of\r\nAmerica, by the trade winds, is possible enough; and its probability would\r\nbe greatly strengthened by ascertaining a similarity of language, which I\r\nconsider as the strongest of all proofs of consanguinity among nations.\r\nStill a question would remain between the red men of the eastern and\r\nwestern sides of the Atlantic, which is the stock, and which the shoot? If\r\na fact be true, which I suspect to be true, that there is a much greater\r\nnumber of radical languages among those of America than among those of\r\nthe other hemisphere, it would be a proof of superior antiquity, which I\r\ncan conceive no arguments strong enough to overrule.\r\n\r\nWhen I received your letter, the time of my departure was too near,\r\nto permit me to obtain information from Constantinople, relative to\r\nthe demand and price of rice there. I therefore wrote to a merchant at\r\nVersailles, concerned in the Levant trade, for the prices current of rice\r\nat Constantinople and at Marseilles for several years past. He has sent\r\nme only the present price at Marseilles, and that of a particular cargo\r\nat Constantinople. I send you a copy of his letter. The Algerines form\r\nan obstacle; but the object of our commerce in the Mediterranean is so\r\nimmense, that we ought to surmount that obstacle, and I believe it could\r\nbe done by means in our power, and which, instead of fouling us with the\r\ndishonorable and criminal baseness of France and England, will place us\r\nin the road to respect with all the world.\r\n\r\nI have obtained, and enclose to you, a state of all the rice imported into\r\nthis country in the course of one year, which shows its annual consumption\r\nto be between eighty-one and eighty-two thousand quintals. I think you may\r\nsupplant all the other furnishing States, except as to what is consumed\r\nat Marseilles and its neighborhood. In fact, Paris is the place of main\r\nconsumption. Havre, therefore, is the port of deposit, where you ought to\r\nhave one or two honest, intelligent and active consignees. The ill success\r\nof a first or second experiment should not damp the endeavors to open\r\nthis market fully, but the obstacles should be forced by perseverance. I\r\nhave obtained from different quarters seeds of the dry rice; but having\r\nhad time to try them, I find they will not vegetate, having been too long\r\nkept. I have still several other expectations from the East Indies. If\r\nthis rice be as good, the object of health will render it worth experiment\r\nwith you. Cotton is a precious resource, and which cannot fail with you.\r\nI wish the cargo of olive plants sent by the way of Baltimore, and that\r\nwhich you will perceive my correspondent is preparing now to send, may\r\narrive to you in good order. This is the object for the patriots of your\r\ncountry; for that tree once established there, will be the source of the\r\ngreatest wealth and happiness. But to insure success, perseverance may be\r\nnecessary. An essay or two may fail. I think, therefore, that an annual\r\nsum should be subscribed, and it need not be a great one. A common country\r\nlaborer should be engaged to make it his sole occupation, to prepare\r\nand pack plants and berries at Marseilles, and in the autumn to go with\r\nthem himself through the canal of Languedoc to Bordeaux, and there to\r\nstay with them till he can put them on board a vessel bound directly for\r\nCharleston; and this repeated annually, till you have a sufficient stock\r\ninsured, to propagate from without further importation. I should guess\r\nthat fifty guineas a year would do this, and if you think proper to set\r\nsuch a subscription afoot, write me down for ten guineas of the money,\r\nyearly, during my stay in France, and offer my superintendence of the\r\nbusiness on this side the water, if no better can be had.\r\n\r\nMr. Cutting does full justice to the honorable dispositions of the\r\nlegislature of South Carolina towards their foreign creditors. None have\r\nyet come into the propositions sent to me, except the Van Staphorsts.\r\n\r\nThe danger of famine here, has not ceased with a plentiful harvest. A\r\nnew and unskilful administration has not yet got into the way of bringing\r\nregular supplies to the Capital. We are in danger of hourly insurrection\r\nfor the want of bread; and an insurrection once begun for that cause,\r\nmay associate itself with those discontented for other causes, and\r\nproduce incalculable events. But if the want of bread does not produce a\r\ncommencement of disorder, I am of opinion the other discontents will be\r\nstifled, and a good and free constitution established without opposition.\r\nIn fact, the mass of the people, the clergy and army (excepting the higher\r\norders of the three bodies), are in as compact an union as can be. The\r\nNational Assembly have decided that their executive shall be hereditary,\r\nand shall have a suspensive negative on the laws; that the legislature\r\nshall be of one House, annual in its sessions and biennial in its\r\nelections. Their declaration of rights will give you their other general\r\nviews. I am just on my departure for Virginia, where the arrangement of my\r\naffairs will detain me the winter; after which (say in February) I shall\r\ngo on to New York, to embark from some northern port for France. In the\r\nmeanwhile and always, I am, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 Paris, September 19, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,--I had the honor of addressing you on the 30th of the last month.\r\nSince that, I have taken the liberty of consigning to you a box of\r\nofficer's muskets, containing half a dozen, made by the person and on the\r\nplan which I mentioned to you in a letter which I cannot turn to at this\r\nmoment, but I think it was of the year 1785. A more particular account of\r\nthem you will find in the enclosed copy of a letter which I have written\r\nto General Knox. The box is marked T. J. No. 36, is gone to Havre, and\r\nwill be forwarded to you by the first vessel bound to New York, by Mr.\r\nNathaniel Cutting, an American gentleman establishing himself there.\r\n\r\nRecalling to your mind the account I gave you of the number and size of\r\nships fitted out by the English last year, for the northern whale fishery,\r\nand comparing with it what they have fitted out this year, for the same\r\nfishery, the comparison will stand thus:\r\n\r\n      Years.       Vessels.     Tons.       Men.\r\n       1788.         255       75,436     10,710\r\n       1789.         178       51,473      7,476\r\n                   -----       ------     ------\r\n  Difference.         77       23,963      3,234\r\n\r\nBy which you will perceive, that they have lost a third of that fishery in\r\none year, which I think almost entirely, if not quite, ascribable to the\r\nshutting the French ports against their oil. I have no account of their\r\nsouthern fishery of the present year.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I was informed that our bankers had the money ready for the\r\nredemption of our captives, I went to the General of the order of the Holy\r\nTrinity, who retained all his dispositions to aid us in that business.\r\nHaving a very confidential agent at Marseilles, better acquainted than\r\nhimself with the details, he wrote to him for his opinion and information\r\non the subject. I enclose you a copy of his answer, the original of which\r\nwas communicated to me. I thereupon have authorized the General to go\r\nas far as three thousand livres a head, for our captives, and for this\r\npurpose, to adopt the plan proposed, of sending one of his own religion at\r\nour expense, (which will be small,) or any other plan he thinks best. The\r\nhonesty and goodness of his character places us in safety in his hands.\r\nTo leave him without any hesitation in engaging himself for such a sum\r\nof money, it was necessary to deposit it in a banker's hands here. Mr.\r\nGrand's were agreeable to him, and I have therefore desired our banker\r\nat Amsterdam, to remit it here. I do not apprehend, in the progress of\r\nthe present revolution, anything like a general bankruptcy which should\r\npervade the whole class of bankers. Were such an event to appear imminent,\r\nthe excessive caution of the house of Grand and Company, establishes it\r\nin the general opinion as the last that would give way, and consequently\r\nwould give time to withdraw this money from their hands. Mr. Short will\r\nattend to this, and will withdraw the money on the first well-founded\r\nappearance of danger. He has asked me what he shall do with it? Because\r\nit is evident, that when Grand cannot be trusted, no other individual\r\nat Paris can, and a general bankruptcy can only be the effect of such\r\ndisorders, as would render every private house an insecure deposit. I have\r\nnot hesitated to say to him, in such an event, \"pay it to the government.\"\r\nIn this case, it becomes only a change of destination and no loss at all.\r\nBut this has passed between us for greater caution only, and on the worst\r\ncase supposable; for though a suspension of payment by government might\r\naffect the bankers a little, I doubt if any of them have embarked so much\r\nin the hands of government as to endanger failure, and especially as they\r\nhave had such long warning.\r\n\r\nYou will have known, that the ordinance passed by M. de Chillon in St.\r\nDomingo, for opening ports to our importations in another part of the\r\nisland, was protested against by Marbois. He had always led the Count\r\nde La Luzerne by the nose, while Governor of that island. Marbois'\r\nrepresentations, and Luzerne's prepossessions against our trade with\r\ntheir colonies, occasioned him, as minister of that department, not only\r\nto reverse the ordinance, but to recall Chillon and send out a successor.\r\nChillon has arrived here, and having rendered himself very popular in the\r\nislands, their deputies in the National Assembly have brought the question\r\nbefore them. The Assembly has done nothing more, as yet, than to appoint\r\na committee of inquiry. So much of Chillon's ordinance as admitted the\r\nimportation of our provisions, is continued for a time. M. de Marbois,\r\ntoo, is recalled, I know not why or how. M. de La Luzerne's conduct will\r\nprobably come under view only incidentally to the general question urged\r\nby the colony deputies, whether they shall not be free in future, to\r\nprocure provisions where they can procure them cheapest? But the deputies\r\nare disposed to treat M. de La Luzerne roughly. This, with the disgrace\r\nof his brother, the bishop de Langres, turned out of the presidentship\r\nof the National Assembly, for partiality in office to the aristocratic\r\nprinciples, and the disfavor of the Assembly towards M. de La Luzerne\r\nhimself, as having been formerly of the _plot_ (as they call it) with\r\nBreteuil and Broglio, will probably occasion him to be out of office soon.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury board have no doubt attended to the necessity of giving\r\ntimely orders for the payment of the February interest at Amsterdam.\r\nI am well informed that our credit is now the first at that exchange,\r\n(England not borrowing at present.) Our five per cent. bonds have risen to\r\nninety-seven and ninety-nine. They have been heretofore at ninety-three.\r\nThere are, at this time, several companies and individuals here, in\r\nEngland and Holland, negotiating to sell large parcels of our _liquidated\r\ndebt_. A bargain was concluded by one of these the other day, for six\r\nhundred thousand dollars. In the present state of our credit, every dollar\r\nof this debt will probably be transferred to Europe within a short time.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 20th. The combination of bankers and other ministerial\r\ntools, had led me into the error (when I wrote my last letter) into which\r\nthey had led most people, that the loan lately opened here went on well.\r\nThe truth is, that very little has been borrowed, perhaps not more than\r\nsix or eight millions. The King and his ministers were yesterday to carry\r\ntheir plate to the mint. The ladies are giving up their jewels to the\r\nNational Assembly. A contribution of plate in the time of Louis XV. is\r\nsaid to have carried about eight millions to the treasury. Plate is much\r\nmore common now, and therefore, if the example prevail now in the same\r\ndegree it did then, it will produce more. The contribution of jewels will\r\nhardly be general, and will be unproductive. Mr. Neckar is, on the 25th,\r\nto go to the Assembly, to make some proposition. The hundredth penny is\r\ntalked of.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly proceeds slowly in the forming their constitution. The\r\noriginal vice of their numbers causes this, as well as a tumultuous manner\r\nof doing business. They have voted that the elections of the legislature\r\nshall be biennial; that it shall be of a single body; but they have not\r\nyet decided what shall be its number, or whether they shall be all in one\r\nroom, or in two, (which they call a division into sections). They have\r\ndetermined that the King shall have a _suspensive and iterative veto_;\r\nthat is, that after negativing a law, it cannot be presented again till\r\nafter a new election. If he negatives it then, it cannot be presented a\r\nthird time till after another new election. If it be then presented, he\r\nis obliged to pass it. This is perhaps justly considered as a more useful\r\nnegative than an absolute one, which a King would be afraid to use. Mr.\r\nNeckar's influence with the Assembly is nothing at all. Having written\r\nto them, by order of the King, on the subject of the veto, before it\r\nwas decided, they refused to let his letter be read. Again, lately, when\r\nthey desired the sanction of the King to their proceedings of the fourth\r\nof August, he wrote in the King's name a letter to them, remonstrating\r\nagainst an immediate sanction to the whole; but they persisted, and\r\nthe sanction was given. His disgust at this want of influence, together\r\nwith the great difficulties of his situation, make it believed that he\r\nis desirous of resigning. The public stocks were extremely low the day\r\nbefore yesterday. The _caisse d'escompte_ at three thousand six hundred\r\nand forty, and the loan of one hundred and twenty-five millions, of 1784,\r\nwas at fifteen per cent. loss. Yesterday they rose a little.\r\n\r\nThe sloth of the Assembly (unavoidable from their number) has done the\r\nmost sensible injury to the public cause. The patience of a people who\r\nhave less of that quality than any other nation in the world, is worn\r\nthread-bare. Time has been given to the aristocrats to recover from\r\ntheir panic, to cabal, to sow dissensions in the Assembly, and distrust\r\nout of it. It has been a misfortune, that the King and aristocracy\r\ntogether have not been able to make a sufficient resistance, to hoop the\r\npatriots in a compact body. Having no common enemy of such force as to\r\nrender their union necessary, they have suffered themselves to divide.\r\nThe assembly now consists of four distinct parties. 1. The aristocrats,\r\ncomprehending the higher members of the clergy, military, nobility, and\r\nthe parliaments of the whole kingdom. This forms a head without a body.\r\n2. The moderate royalists, who wish for a constitution nearly similar\r\nto that of England. 3. The republicans, who are willing to let their\r\nfirst magistracy be hereditary, but to make it very subordinate to the\r\nlegislature, and to have that legislature consist of a single chamber.\r\n4. The faction of Orleans. The second and third descriptions are composed\r\nof honest, well-meaning men, differing in opinion only, but both wishing\r\nthe establishment of as great a degree of liberty as can be preserved.\r\nThey are considered together as constituting the patriotic part of the\r\nAssembly, and they are supported by the soldiery of the army, the soldiery\r\nof the clergy, that is to say, the Curés and monks, the dissenters, and\r\npart of the nobility which is small, and the substantial Bourgeoise of\r\nthe whole nation. The part of these collected in the cities, have formed\r\nthemselves into municipal bodies, have chosen municipal representatives,\r\nand have organized an armed corps, considerably more numerous in the\r\nwhole than the regular army. They have also the ministry, such as it\r\nis, and as yet, the King. Were the second and third parties, or rather\r\nthese sections of the same party, to separate entirely, this great mass\r\nof power and wealth would be split, nobody knows how. But I do not think\r\nthey will separate; because they have the same honest views; because,\r\neach being confident of the rectitude of the other, there is no rancor\r\nbetween them; because they retain the desire of coalescing. In order to\r\neffect this, they not long ago proposed a conference, and desired it might\r\nbe at my house, which gave me an opportunity of judging of their views.\r\nThey discussed together their points of difference for six hours, and in\r\nthe course of discussion agreed on mutual sacrifices. The effect of this\r\nagreement has been considerably defeated by the subsequent proceedings of\r\nthe Assembly, but I do not know that it has been through any infidelity\r\nof the leaders to the compromise they had agreed on. Another powerful\r\nbond of union between these two parties, is our friend the Marquis de\r\nLa Fayette. He left the Assembly while they as yet formed but one party.\r\nHis attachment to both is equal, and he labors incessantly to keep them\r\ntogether. Should he be obliged to take part against either, it will be\r\nagainst that which shall first pass the Rubicon of reconciliation with the\r\nother. I should hope, in this event, that his weight would be sufficient\r\nto turn the scale decidedly in favor of the other. His command of the\r\narmed militia of Paris (thirty thousand in number, and comprehending the\r\nFrench guards who are five thousand regulars), and his influence with the\r\nmunicipality, would secure their city; and though the armed militia and\r\nmunicipalities of the other cities are in nowise subordinate to those of\r\nParis, yet they look up to them with respect, and look particularly to\r\nthe Marquis de La Fayette, as leading always to the rights of the people.\r\nThis turn of things is so probable, that I do not think either section\r\nof the patriots will venture on any act, which will place themselves in\r\nopposition to him.\r\n\r\nThis being the face of things, troubled as you will perceive, civil war is\r\nmuch talked of and expected; and this talk and expectation has a tendency\r\nto beget it. What are the events which may produce it? 1. The want of\r\nbread, were it to produce a commencement of disorder, might ally itself to\r\nmore permanent causes of discontent, and thus continue the effect beyond\r\nits first cause. The scarcity of bread, which continues very great amidst\r\na plenty of corn, is an enigma which can be solved only by observing, that\r\nthe furnishing the city is in the new municipality, not yet masters of\r\ntheir trade. 2. A public bankruptcy. Great numbers of the lower as well as\r\nhigher classes of the citizens, depend for subsistence on their property\r\nin the public funds. 3. The absconding of the King from Versailles. This\r\nhas for some time been apprehended as possible. In consequence of this\r\napprehension, a person whose information would have weight, wrote to the\r\nCount de Montmorin, adjuring him to prevent it by every possible means,\r\nand assuring him that the flight of the King would be the signal of a\r\nSt. Barthelemi against the aristocrats in Paris, and perhaps through the\r\nkingdom. M. de Montmorin showed the letter to the Queen, who assured him\r\nsolemnly that no such thing was in contemplation. His showing it to the\r\nQueen, proves he entertained the same mistrust with the public. It may\r\nbe asked, what is the Queen disposed to do in the present situation of\r\nthings? Whatever rage, pride and fear can dictate in a breast which never\r\nknew the presence of one moral restraint.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, I do not see it as yet probable that any actual commotion\r\nwill take place; and if it does take place, I have strong confidence that\r\nthe patriotic party will hold together, and their party in the nation be\r\nwhat I have described it. In this case, there would be against them the\r\naristocracy and the faction of Orleans. This consists, at this time, of\r\nonly the Catalines of the Assembly, and some of the lowest description\r\nof the mob. Its force, _within the kingdom_, must depend on how much of\r\nthis last kind of people it can debauch with money from its present bias\r\nto the right cause. This bias is as strong as any one can be, in a class\r\nwhich must accept its bread from him who will give it. Its resources _out\r\nof the kingdom_ are not known. Without doubt, England will give money to\r\nproduce and to feed the fire which should consume this country; but it\r\nis not probable she will engage in open war for that. If foreign troops\r\nshould be furnished, it would be most probably by the King of Prussia, who\r\nseems to offer himself as the bull-dog of tyranny to all his neighbors. He\r\nmight, too, be disturbed by the contagion of the same principles gaining\r\nhis own subjects, as they have done those of the Austrian Netherlands,\r\nLiege, Cologne, and Hesse Cassel. The army of the latter Prince, joining\r\nwith his subjects, are said to have possessed themselves of the treasures\r\nhe had amassed by hiring troops to conquer us, and by other iniquities.\r\nFifty-four millions of livres is the sum mentioned. But all these means,\r\nexternal and internal, must prove inadequate to their ultimate object, if\r\nthe nation be united as it is at present. Expecting within a few days to\r\nleave Paris, and that this is my last letter on public subjects, I have\r\nindulged myself in giving you a general view of things, as they appear\r\nto me at the time of my leaving them. Mr. Short will have the honor\r\nof continuing the narration, and of correcting it, where circumstances\r\nunknown or unforeseen may give a different turn to events.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. NECKAR.\r\n\r\n                                                 Paris, September 26, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,--I had the honor of waiting on you at Versailles the day before\r\nyesterday, in order to present my respects on my departure to America. I\r\nwas unlucky in the moment, as it was one in which you were gone out.\r\n\r\nI wished to have put into your hands, at the same time, the enclosed state\r\nof the British northern fishery for the years 1788 and 1789, by which you\r\nwill see that they have lost in one year one-third of that fishery, the\r\neffect, almost solely, of the _Arret_ which shut the ports of France to\r\ntheir oils.\r\n\r\nI wished also to know, whether, while in America, I could be useful\r\ntowards encouraging supplies of provision to be brought to this country\r\nthe ensuing year. I am persuaded a considerable relief to the city\r\nof Paris might be obtained, by permitting the importation of salted\r\nprovisions from the United States. Our salted beef particularly (which,\r\nsince the war, we have learned to prepare in the Irish manner, so as to be\r\nas good as the best of that country), could be sold out to the people of\r\nParis for the half of what they pay for fresh meat. It would seem then,\r\nthat the laborer paying but half the usual price for his meat, might pay\r\nthe full price of his bread, and so relieve government from its loss\r\non that article. The interest of the _gabelles_ has been an objection\r\nhitherto, to the importation of salted provisions. But that objection is\r\nlessened by the reduction of the price of salt, and done away entirely by\r\nthe desire of the present government to consider the ease and happiness\r\nof the people as the first object. In every country as fully peopled as\r\nFrance, it would seem good policy to encourage the employment of its lands\r\nin the cultivation of corn, rather than in pasturage, and consequently to\r\nencourage the use of all kinds of salted provisions, because they can be\r\nimported from other countries. It may be apprehended, that the Parisian,\r\nhabituated to fresh provision, would not use salted. Then he would not buy\r\nthem, and of course they would not be brought, so that no harm can be done\r\nby the permission. On the contrary, if the people of Paris should readily\r\nadopt the use of salted provisions, the good would result which is before\r\nmentioned. Salt meat is not as good as fresh for soups, but it gives a\r\nhigher flavor to the vegetables boiled with it. The experience of a great\r\npart of America, which is fed almost entirely on it, proves it to be as\r\nwholesome as fresh meat. The sea scurvy, ascribed by some to the use of\r\nsalt meat, is equally unknown in America as in Europe. It is the want of\r\nvegetables at sea which produces the scurvy. I have thus hastily mentioned\r\nreasons and objections, to save you the time and trouble of recollecting\r\nthem. To you, Sir, it suffices, barely to mention them. Mr. Short, Chargé\r\ndes Affaires for the United States, will have the honor of delivering you\r\nthis, and of giving you any further details which you may be pleased to\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nI shall hope, on my return in the spring, to find your health\r\nre-established, and your mind relieved, by a perfect settlement of the\r\naffairs of the nation; and with my felicitations on those accounts, to\r\nexpress to you those sentiments of profound respect and attachment with\r\nwhich I have the honor to be, your Excellency's most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 Havre, September 30, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--No convenient ship having offered from any port of France, I\r\nhave engaged one from London to take me up at Cowes, and am so far on my\r\nway thither. She will land me at Norfolk, and as I do not know any service\r\nthat would be rendered by my repairing immediately to New York, I propose,\r\nin order to economise time, to go directly to my own house, get through\r\nthe business which calls me there, and then repair to New York, where I\r\nshall be ready to re-embark for Europe. But should there be any occasion\r\nfor government to receive any information I can give, immediately on\r\nmy arrival, I will go to New York on receiving your orders at Richmond.\r\nThey may probably be there before me, as this goes by Mr. Trumbull, bound\r\ndirectly for New York.\r\n\r\nI enclose you herewith the proceedings of the National Assembly on\r\nSaturday last, wherein you will perceive that the committee had approved\r\nthe plan of Mr. Neckar. I can add from other sure information received\r\nhere, that the Assembly adopted it the same evening. This plan may\r\npossibly keep their payments alive till their new government gets into\r\nmotion; though I do not think it very certain. The public stocks lowered\r\nso exceedingly the last days of my stay at Paris, that I wrote to our\r\nbankers at Amsterdam, to desire they would retain till further orders the\r\nthirty thousand guilders, or so much of it as had not yet come on. And as\r\nto what might be already coming on, I recommended to Mr. Short to go and\r\ntake the acceptance himself, and keep the bill in his own hands till the\r\ntime of payment. He will by that time see what is best to be done with\r\nthe money.\r\n\r\nIn taking leave of Monsieur de Montmorin, I asked him whether their\r\nWest India ports would continue open to us awhile. He said they would be\r\nimmediately declared open till February, and we may be sure they will be\r\nso till the next harvest. He agreed with me, that there would be two or\r\nthree months' provision for the whole kingdom wanting for the ensuing\r\nyear. The consumption of bread for the whole kingdom, is two millions\r\nof livres tournois a day. The people pay the real price of their bread\r\neverywhere, except at Paris and Versailles. There the price is suffered\r\nto vary very little as to them, and government pays the difference. It\r\nhas been supposed that this difference for some time past, has cost a\r\nmillion a week. I thought the occasion favorable to propose to Monsieur de\r\nMontmorin the free admission of our salted provisions, observing to him\r\nparticularly that our salted beef from the Eastern States could be dealt\r\nout to the people of Paris for five or six sols the pound, which is but\r\nhalf the common price they pay for fresh beef; that the Parisian paying\r\nless for his meat, might pay more for his bread, and so relieve government\r\nfrom its enormous loss on that article. His idea of this resource seemed\r\nunfavorable. We talked over the objections of the supposed unhealthiness\r\nof that food, its tendency to produce scurvy, the chance of its taking\r\nwith a people habituated to fresh meat, their comparative qualities\r\nof rendering vegetables eatable, and the interests of the gabelles. He\r\nconcluded with saying the experiment might be tried, and with desiring me\r\nto speak with Mr. Neckar. I went to Mr. Neckar, but he had gone to the\r\nNational Assembly. On my return to Paris, therefore, I wrote to him on\r\nthe subject, going over the objections which Monsieur de Montmorin had\r\nstarted. Mr. Short was to carry the letter himself, and to pursue the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nHaving observed that our commerce to Havre is considerably on the\r\nincrease, and that most of our vessels coming there, and especially those\r\nfrom the eastward, are obliged to make a voyage round to the neighborhood\r\nof the Loire and Garonne for salt, a voyage attended with expense, delay,\r\nand more risk, I have obtained from the Farmers General, that they shall\r\nbe supplied from their magazines at Honfleur, opposite to Havre, at a\r\nmercantile price. They fix it at present at sixty livres the _muid_,\r\nwhich comes to about fifteen sous, or seven and a half pence sterling our\r\nbushel; but it will vary as the price varies at the place from which they\r\nbring it. As this will be a great relief to such of our vessels coming\r\nto Havre, as might wish to take back salt, it may perhaps be proper to\r\nnotify it to our merchants. I enclose herewith Mr. Neckar's discourse to\r\nthe Assembly, which was not printed till I left Paris; and have the honor\r\nto be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nLETTERS WRITTEN AFTER HIS RETURN TO THE U. S. DOWN TO THE TIME OF HIS\r\nDEATH.\r\n\r\n1789-1826.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n                                           Chesterfield, December 15, 1789.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have received at this place the honor of your letters of\r\nOctober the 13th and November the 30th, and am truly flattered by your\r\nnomination of me to the very dignified office of Secretary of State;\r\nfor which, permit me here to return you my humble thanks. Could any\r\ncircumstance seduce me to overlook the disproportion between its duties\r\nand my talents, it would be the encouragement of your choice. But when I\r\ncontemplate the extent of that office, embracing as it does the principal\r\nmass of domestic administration, together with the foreign, I cannot be\r\ninsensible of my inequality to it; and I should enter on it with gloomy\r\nforebodings from the criticisms and censures of a public, just indeed in\r\ntheir intentions, but sometimes misinformed and misled, and always too\r\nrespectable to be neglected. I cannot but foresee the possibility that\r\nthis may end disagreeably for me, who, having no motive to public service\r\nbut the public satisfaction, would certainly retire the moment that\r\nsatisfaction should appear to languish. On the other hand, I feel a degree\r\nof familiarity with the duties of my present office, as far at least as I\r\nam capable of understanding its duties. The ground I have already passed\r\nover, enables me to see my way into that which is before me. The change of\r\ngovernment too, taking place in a country where it is exercised, seems to\r\nopen a possibility of procuring from the new rulers, some new advantages\r\nin commerce, which may be agreeable to our countrymen. So that as far as\r\nmy fears, my hopes, or my inclinations might enter into this question, I\r\nconfess they would not lead me to prefer a change.\r\n\r\nBut it is not for an individual to choose his post. You are to marshal\r\nus as may best be for the public good; and it is only in the case of its\r\nbeing indifferent to you, that I would avail myself of the option you have\r\nso kindly offered in your letter. If you think it better to transfer me\r\nto another post, my inclination must be no obstacle; nor shall it be, if\r\nthere is any desire to suppress the office I now hold, or to reduce its\r\ngrade. In either of these cases, be so good only as to signify to me by\r\nanother line your ultimate wish, and I shall conform to it cordially. If\r\nit should be to remain at New York, my chief comfort will be to work under\r\nyour eye, my only shelter the authority of your name, and the wisdom of\r\nmeasures to be dictated by you and implicitly executed by me. Whatever you\r\nmay be pleased to decide, I do not see that the matters which have called\r\nme hither, will permit me to shorten the stay I originally asked; that\r\nis to say, to set out on my journey northward till the month of March.\r\nAs early as possible in that month, I shall have the honor of paying my\r\nrespects to you in New York. In the meantime, I have that of tendering\r\nyou the homage of those sentiments of respectful attachment with which I\r\nam, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE REV. CHARLES CLAY.\r\n\r\n                                              Monticello, January 27, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I had hoped that during my stay here I could have had the\r\npleasure of seeing you in Bedford, but I find it will be too short for\r\nthat. Besides views of business in that country, I had wished again to\r\nvisit that greatest of our curiosities, the Natural Bridge, and did not\r\nknow but you might have the same desire. I do not know yet how I am to\r\nbe disposed of, whether kept at New York, or sent back to Europe. If\r\nthe former, one of my happinesses would be the possibility of seeing you\r\nthere; for I understand you are a candidate for the representation of your\r\ndistrict in Congress. I cannot be with you to give you my vote, nor do\r\nI know who are to be the competitors, but I am sure I shall be contented\r\nwith such a representative as you will make; because I know you are too\r\nhonest a patriot not to wish to see our country prosper by any means,\r\nthough they be not exactly those you would have preferred; and that you\r\nare too well informed a politician, too good a judge of men, not to know,\r\nthat the ground of liberty is to be gained by inches, that we must be\r\ncontented to secure what we can get, from time to time, and eternally\r\npress forward for what is yet to get. It takes time to persuade men to do\r\neven what is for their own good. Wishing you every prosperity in this,\r\nand in all your other undertakings (for I am sure from my knowledge of\r\nyou they will always be just), I am, with sincere esteem and respect, dear\r\nSir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                             Monticello, February 14, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have duly received the letter of the 21st of January with which\r\nyou have honored me, and no longer hesitate to undertake the office to\r\nwhich you are pleased to call me. Your desire that I should come on as\r\nquickly as possible, is a sufficient reason for me to postpone every\r\nmatter of business, however pressing, which admits postponement. Still,\r\nit will be the close of the ensuing week before I can get away, and then\r\nI shall have to go by the way of Richmond, which will lengthen my road.\r\nI shall not fail, however, to go on with all the despatch possible, nor\r\nto satisfy you, I hope, when I shall have the honor of seeing you in New\r\nYork, that the circumstances which prevent my immediate departure, are not\r\nunder my control. I have now that of being, with sentiments of the most\r\nperfect respect and attachment, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY, CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                             Monticello, February 14, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I am honored with your favor of December 12, and thank you for\r\nyour friendly congratulations on my return to my native country, as well\r\nas for the interest you are pleased to express in the appointment with\r\nwhich I have been honored. I have thought it my duty to undertake it,\r\nthough with no prepossessions in favor of my talents for executing it to\r\nthe satisfaction of the public. With respect to the young gentlemen in\r\nthe office of foreign affairs, their possession and your recommendation\r\nare the strongest titles. But I suppose the ordinance establishing my\r\noffice, allows but one assistant; and I should be wanting in candor to you\r\nand them, were I not to tell you that another candidate has been proposed\r\nto me, on ground that cannot but command respect. I know neither him nor\r\nthem, and my hope is, that, as but one can be named, the object is too\r\nsmall to occasion either mortification or disappointment to either. I\r\nam sure I shall feel more pain at not being able to avail myself of the\r\nassistance but of one of the gentlemen, than they will at the betaking\r\nthemselves to some better pursuit. I ask it of your friendship, my\r\ndear Sir, to make them sensible of my situation, and to accept yourself\r\nassurances of the sincere esteem and respect with which I have the honor\r\nto be, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WM. HUNTER, ESQ., MAYOR OF ALEXANDRIA.\r\n\r\n                                                Alexandria, March 11, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,--Accept my sincere thanks for yourself and the worthy citizens of\r\nAlexandria, for their kind congratulations on my return to my native\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nI am happy they have felt benefits from the encouragement of our commerce,\r\nwhich have been given by an allied nation. But truth and candor oblige me,\r\nat the same time, to declare, you are indebted for these encouragements\r\nsolely to the friendly dispositions of that nation, which has shown itself\r\nready on every occasion to adopt all arrangements which might strengthen\r\nour ties of mutual interest and friendship.\r\n\r\nConvinced that the republican is the only form of government which is not\r\neternally at open or secret war with the rights of mankind, my prayers\r\nand efforts shall be cordially distributed to the support of that we have\r\nso happily established. It is indeed an animating thought, that while we\r\nare securing the rights of ourselves and our posterity, we are pointing\r\nout the way to struggling nations, who wish like us to emerge from their\r\ntyrannies also. Heaven help their struggles, and lead them, as it has done\r\nus, triumphantly through them.\r\n\r\nAccept, Sir, for yourself and the citizens of Alexandria, the homage of\r\nmy thanks for their civilities, and the assurance of those sentiments of\r\nrespect and attachment with which I have the honor to be, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n                                                  New York, March 28, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I arrived here on the 21st instant, after as laborious a\r\njourney of a fortnight from Richmond as I ever went through; resting only\r\none day at Alexandria, and another at Baltimore. I found my carriage and\r\nhorses at Alexandria, but a snow of eighteen inches deep falling the same\r\nnight, I saw the impossibility of getting on in my own carriage, so left\r\nit there, to be sent to me by water, and had my horses led on to this\r\nplace, taking my passage in the stage, though relieving myself a little\r\nsometimes by mounting my horse. The roads through the whole way were so\r\nbad that we could never go more than three miles an hour, sometimes not\r\nmore than two, and in the night but one. My first object was to look out\r\na house in the Broadway, if possible, as being the centre of my business.\r\nFinding none there vacant for the present, I have taken a small one in\r\nMaiden Lane, which may give me time to look about me. Much business had\r\nbeen put by for my arrival, so that I found myself all at once involved\r\nunder an accumulation of it. When this shall be got through, I will be\r\nable to judge whether the ordinary business of my department will leave\r\nme any leisure. I fear there will be little.\r\n\r\nLetters from Paris to the 25th of December, inform me that the revolution\r\nthere was still advancing with a steady pace. There had been two\r\nriots since my departure. The one on the 5th and 6th of October, which\r\noccasioned the royal family to remove to Paris, in which nine or ten\r\nof the Gardes de Corps fell, and among these a Chevalier de Daricourt,\r\nbrother of Madame de La Dillatte, and of Mademoiselle Daricourt ----\r\nfriend. The second was on the 21st of the same month, in which a baker\r\nhad been hung by the mob. On this occasion, the government (_i. e._ the\r\nNational Assembly) proclaimed Martial Law in Paris, and had two of the\r\nringleaders of the mob seized, tried, and hung, which was effected without\r\nany movement on the part of the people. Others were still to be tried.\r\nThe troubles in Brabant becomes serious. The insurgents have routed the\r\nregular troops in every rencounter.\r\n\r\nCongress is principally occupied by the treasury report. The assumption\r\nof the State debts has been voted affirmatively in the first instance,\r\nbut it is not certain it will hold its ground through all the changes\r\nof the bill when it shall be brought in. I have recommended Mr. D. R. to\r\nthe President for the office he desired, in case of a vacancy. It seemed,\r\nhowever, as if the President had had no intimation before, that a vacancy\r\nwas expected.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                      Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE JOY.\r\n\r\n                                                  New York, March 31, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have considered your application for sea letters for the ship\r\nEliza, and examined into the precedents which you supposed might influence\r\nthe determination. The resolution of Congress, which imposes this duty\r\non the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, provides expressly, \"that it be\r\nmade to appear to him by oath or affirmation, or _by such other evidence\r\nas shall by him be deemed satisfactory_, that the vessel is commanded\r\nby officers, citizens of the United States.\" Your affidavit satisfies me\r\nthat one of the officers is a citizen of the United States; but you are\r\nunacquainted with the others and without evidence as to them, and even\r\nwithout a presumption that they are citizens, except so far as arises\r\non the circumstances of the captain's being an American, and the ship\r\nsailing from an American port. Now, I cannot in my conscience say, that\r\nthis is _evidence of the fact, satisfactory to my mind_. The precedents\r\nof relaxation by Mr. Jay, were all between the date of the resolution\r\nof Congress (February the 12th, 1788) and his public advertisement,\r\nannouncing the evidence which must be produced. Since this last, the\r\nproceedings have been uniform and exact. Having perfect confidence in your\r\ngood faith, and therefore without a suspicion of any fraud intended in\r\nthe present case, I could have wished sincerely to grant the sea letter;\r\nbut besides the letter of the law which ties me down, the public security\r\nagainst a partial dispensation of justice, depends on its being dispensed\r\nby certain rules. The slightest deviation in one circumstance, becomes\r\na precedent for another, that for a third, and so on, without bounds. A\r\nrelaxation in a case where it is certain no fraud is intended, is laid\r\nhold of by others, afterwards, to cover fraud. I hope, therefore, you\r\nwill be sensible of the necessity of my adhering to the rules which have\r\nbeen published and practised by my predecessor; and that I am with great\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR WILLARD.\r\n\r\n                                                   New York, April 1, 1790.\r\n\r\nI have duly received the letter wherein you are so good as to notify\r\nto me the honor done me by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,\r\nin electing me one of their members, together with the diploma therein\r\nenclosed; and I beg leave through you, Sir, to return to the Academy the\r\nhomage of my thanks for their favor, and to express to them the grateful\r\nsense I have of it. I only regret the small prospect I have of being\r\nuseful to them, engaged as I continually am in occupations less pleasing\r\nto me, and which would be better performed by others. Unacquainted with\r\nthe duties which the election into your Academy imposes on me, I can only\r\nexpress my desire of fulfilling them on their being made to me.\r\n\r\nMr. Read has explained to me his drawings and models. They prove that he\r\nmerits the character you are pleased to give of him. He waits at present\r\nthe passage of a law for securing to inventors the benefit of their own\r\ningenuity. I have the honor to be, with the most respectful esteem, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\n                                                   New York, April 2, 1790.\r\n\r\nBehold me, my dear friend, elected Secretary of State, instead of\r\nreturning to the far more agreeable position which placed me in the\r\ndaily participation of your friendship. I found the appointment in the\r\nnewspapers the day of my arrival in Virginia. I had indeed been asked\r\nwhile in France, whether I would accept of any appointment at home, and\r\nI had answered that, not meaning to remain long where I was, I meant it\r\nto be the last office I should ever act in. Unfortunately this letter\r\nhad not arrived at the time of arranging the new Government. I expressed\r\nfreely to the President my desire to return. He left me free, but still\r\nshowing his own desire. This, and the concern of others, more general\r\nthan I had a right to expect, induced, after three months parleying, to\r\nsacrifice my own inclinations. I have been here, then, ten days harnessed\r\nin new gear. Wherever I am, or ever shall be, I shall be sincere in my\r\nfriendship to you and to your nation. I think with others, that nations\r\nare to be governed with regard to their own interests, but I am convinced\r\nthat it is their interest, in the long run, to be grateful, faithful\r\nto their engagements, even in the worst of circumstances, and honorable\r\nand generous always. If I had not known that the head of our government\r\nwas in these sentiments, and that his national and private ethics were\r\nthe same, I would never have been where I am. I am sorry to tell you his\r\nhealth is less firm than it used to be. However, there is nothing in it\r\nto give alarm. The opposition to our new Constitution has almost totally\r\ndisappeared. Some few indeed had gone such lengths in their declarations\r\nof hostility, that they feel it awkward perhaps to come over; but the\r\namendments proposed by Congress, have brought over almost all their\r\nfollowers. If the President can be preserved a few years till habits of\r\nauthority and obedience can be established generally, we have nothing to\r\nfear. The little vaut-rien, Rhode Island, will come over with a little\r\nmore time. Our last news from Paris is of the 8th of January. So far it\r\nseemed that your revolution had got along with a steady peace; meeting\r\nindeed occasional difficulties and dangers, but we are not to expect to\r\nbe translated from despotism to liberty in a feather-bed. I have never\r\nfeared for the ultimate result, though I have feared for you personally.\r\nIndeed, I hope you will never see such another 5th or 6th of October. Take\r\ncare of yourself, my dear friend, for though I think your nation would in\r\nany event work out her salvation, I am persuaded, were she to lose you, it\r\nwould cost her oceans of blood, and years of confusion and anarchy. Kiss\r\nand bless your dear children for me. Learn them to be as you are, a cement\r\nbetween our two nations. I write to Madame de La Fayette, so have only\r\nto add assurances of the respect of your affectionate friend and humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nMADAME DE CORNY.\r\n\r\n                                                   New York, April 2, 1790.\r\n\r\nI had the happiness, my dear friend, to arrive in Virginia, after a voyage\r\nof twenty-six days only, of the finest autumn weather it was possible to\r\nhave; the wind having never blown harder than we would have desired it.\r\nOn my arrival I found my name in the newspapers announced as Secretary\r\nof State. I made light of it, supposing I had only to say \"No,\" and there\r\nwould be an end of it. It turned out, however, otherwise. For though I was\r\nleft free to return to France, if I insisted on it, yet I found it better\r\nin the end to sacrifice my own inclinations to those of others. After\r\nholding off, therefore, near three months, I acquiesced. I did not write\r\nto you while this question was in suspense, because I was in constant\r\nhope of being able to say to you certainly that I should return. Instead\r\nof that, I am now to say certainly the contrary, and instead of greeting\r\nyou personally in Paris, I am to write you a letter of adieu. Accept,\r\nthen, my dear Madam, my cordial adieu, and my grateful thanks for all the\r\ncivilities and kindnesses I have received from you. They have been greatly\r\nmore than I had a right to expect, and they have excited in me a warmth of\r\nesteem which it was imprudent in me to have given way to for a person whom\r\nI was one day to be separated from. Since it is so, continue towards me\r\nthose friendly sentiments I have always flattered myself you entertained;\r\nlet me hear from you sometimes, assured that I shall always feel a warm\r\ninterest in your happiness. Your letter of November 25 afflicts me; but\r\nI hope that a revolution so pregnant with the general happiness of the\r\nnation, will not in the end injure the interests of persons who are so\r\nfriendly to the general good of mankind as yourself and M. de Corny.\r\nPresent to him my most affectionate esteem, and ask a place for me in his\r\nrecollection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYour affectionate friend and humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nMADAME LA COMTESSE D'HOUDETOT.\r\n\r\n                                                   New York, April 2, 1790.\r\n\r\nBeing called by our Government to assist in its domestic administration,\r\ninstead of paying my respects to you in person as I had hoped, I am\r\nto write you a letter of adieu. Accept, I pray you, Madam, my grateful\r\nacknowledgments for the manifold kindnesses by which you added so much\r\nto the happiness of my stay in Paris. I have found here a philosophic\r\nrevolution, philosophically effected. Yours, though a little more\r\nturbulent, has, I hope by this time, issued in success and peace.\r\nNobody prays for it more sincerely than I do, and nobody will do more to\r\ncherish a union with a nation, dear to us through many ties, and now more\r\napproximated by the change in its government.\r\n\r\nI found our friend Doctor Franklin in his bed--cheerful and free from\r\npain, but still in his bed. He took a lively interest in the details I\r\ngave him of your revolution. I observed his face often flushed in the\r\ncourse of it. He is much emaciated. Monsieur de Crevecoeur is well, but\r\na little apprehensive that the spirit of reforming and economizing may\r\nreach his office. A good man will suffer if it does. Permit me, Madame la\r\nComtesse, to place here my sincere respects to Monsieur le Comte Houdetot\r\nand to Monsieur de St. Lambert. The philosophy of the latter will have\r\nbeen greatly gratified to see a regeneration of the condition of man in\r\nEurope so happily begun in his own country. Repeating to you, Madam, my\r\nsense of your goodness to me, and my wishes to prove it on every occasion,\r\nadding my sincere prayers that Heaven may bless you with many years of\r\nlife and health, I pray you to accept here the homage of those sentiments\r\nof respect and attachment with which I have the honor to be, Madame la\r\nComtesse, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME LA DUCHESSE D'AUVILLE.\r\n\r\n                                                   New York, April 2, 1790.\r\n\r\nI had hoped, Madame la Duchesse, to have again had the pleasure of paying\r\nmy respects to you in Paris, but the wish of our Government that I should\r\ntake a share in its administration, has become a law to me. Could I have\r\npersuaded myself that public offices were made for private convenience,\r\nI should undoubtedly have preferred a continuance in that which placed me\r\nnearer to you; but believing, on the contrary, that a good citizen should\r\ntake his stand where the public authority marshals him, I have acquiesced.\r\nAmong the circumstances which will reconcile me to my new position, are\r\nthe opportunities it will give me of cementing the friendship between our\r\ntwo nations. Be assured, that to do this is the first wish of my heart.\r\nI have but one system of ethics for men and for nations--to be grateful,\r\nto be faithful to all engagements under all circumstances, to be open\r\nand generous, promoting in the long run even the interests of both; and I\r\nam sure it promotes their happiness. The change in your government will\r\napproximate us to one another. You have had some checks, some horrors\r\nsince I left you; but the way to Heaven, you know, has always been said\r\nto be strewed with thorns. Why your nation have had fewer than any other\r\non earth, I do not know, unless it be that it is the best on earth.\r\nI assure you, Madam, moreover, that I consider yourself personally as\r\nwith the foremost of your nation in every virtue. It is not flattery, my\r\nheart knows not that; it is a homage to sacred truth, it is a tribute I\r\npay with cordiality to a character in which I saw but one error; it was\r\nthat of treating me with a degree of favor I did not merit. Be assured\r\nI shall always retain a lively sense of your goodness to me, which was a\r\ncircumstance of principal happiness to me during my stay in Paris. I hope\r\nthat by this time you have seen that my prognostications of a successful\r\nissue to your revolution, have been verified. I feared for you during\r\na short interval; but after the declaration of the army, though there\r\nmight be episodes of distress, the denouements was out of doubt. Heaven\r\nsend that the glorious example of your country may be but the beginning\r\nof the history of European liberty, and that you may live many years in\r\nhealth and happiness to see at length that Heaven did not make man in its\r\nwrath. Accept the homage of those sentiments of sincere and respectful\r\nesteem with which I have the honor to be, Madame la Duchesse, your most\r\naffectionate and obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE DUKE DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT.\r\n\r\n                                                   New York, April 3, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--A call to take a part in the domestic administration of our\r\nGovernment, obliges me to abandon the expectation of paying my respects\r\nto you in person, in Paris. Though removed to a greater distance in\r\nfuture, and deprived of the pleasure and advantages of your conversation\r\nand society, which contributed so much to render my residence in Paris\r\nagreeable, I shall not be the less anxious for your health and happiness,\r\nand for the prosperous issue of the great revolution in which you have\r\ntaken so zealous and distinguished a part. By this time I hope it is\r\nhappily concluded, and that the new constitution, after receiving the\r\nfinishing hand from the National Assembly, is now putting into regular\r\nmotion by the convocation of a new legislature. I find my countrymen\r\nas anxious for your success as they ought to be; and thinking with\r\nthe National Assembly in all points except that of a single house of\r\nlegislation. They think their own experience has so decidedly proved the\r\nnecessity of two Houses to prevent the tyranny of one, that they fear\r\nthat this single error will shipwreck your new constitution. I am myself\r\npersuaded that theory and practice are not at variance in this instance,\r\nand that you will find it necessary hereafter to add another branch. But I\r\npresume you provide a facility of amending your constitution, and perhaps\r\nthe necessity may be altogether removed by a council of revision well\r\nconstituted.\r\n\r\nAccept, Sir, my sincere thanks for all your kindnesses, permit me to place\r\nhere those which I owe to Madame La Duchesse de La Rochefoucault, and\r\nwhich I render with the greatest cordiality. Were her system of ethics\r\nand of government the system of every one, we should have no occasion\r\nfor government at all. I hope you will both live long years of health and\r\nhappiness to see in full ripeness the fruit of your own revolution, and\r\nalso that which seems blossoming in other parts of Europe. Accept, both,\r\nthe homage of that affectionate and respectful attachment with which I\r\nhave the honor to be your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\n                                                   New York, April 6, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,--The President of the United States having thought proper to assign\r\nto me other functions than those of their Minister Plenipotentiary near\r\nthe King, I have the honor of addressing to your Excellency my letters of\r\nrecall, and of beseeching you to be so good as to present them, with the\r\nhomage of my respectful adieus, to his Majesty.\r\n\r\nIt is with great satisfaction that I find myself authorized to conclude,\r\nas I had begun my mission, with assurances of the attachment of our\r\ngovernment to the King and his people, and of its desire to preserve\r\nand strengthen the harmony and good understanding, which has hitherto so\r\nhappily subsisted between the two nations.\r\n\r\nGive me leave to place here, also, my acknowledgments to your Excellency,\r\npersonally, for the facilities you have been pleased always to give in the\r\nnegotiation of the several matters I have had occasion to treat with you,\r\nduring my residence at your court. They were ever such as to evince, that\r\nthe friendly dispositions towards our republic which you manifested even\r\nfrom its birth, were still found consistent with that patriotism of which\r\nyou have continued to give such constant and disinterested proofs. May\r\nthis union of interests forever be the patriot's creed in both countries.\r\nAccept my sincere prayers that the King, with life and health, may be long\r\nblessed with so faithful and able a servant, and you with a Prince, the\r\nmodel of royal excellence; and permit me to retain to my latest hours,\r\nthose sentiments of affectionate respect and attachment, with which I have\r\nthe honor to be, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\n                                                  New York, April 11, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,--A vessel being about to sail from this port for Cadiz, I avail\r\nmyself of it to inform you, that under the appointment of the President\r\nof the United States, I have entered on the duties of Secretary of State,\r\ncomprehending the department of Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nMr. Jay's letter of October the 2d, acknowledged the receipt of the last\r\nof yours which have come to hand. Since that date he wrote you on the 7th\r\nof December, enclosing a letter for Mr. Chiappe.\r\n\r\nThe receipt of his letter of September the 9th, 1788, having never been\r\nacknowledged, the contents of which were important and an answer wished\r\nfor, I send you herewith a duplicate, lest it should have miscarried.\r\n\r\nYou will also receive herewith, a letter of credence for yourself, to be\r\ndelivered to the Count de Florida Blanca, after putting thereon the proper\r\naddress, with which I am unacquainted. A copy of it is enclosed for your\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to recommend the case of Don Blas Gonzalez to your good\r\noffices with the court of Spain, enclosing you the documents necessary\r\nfor its illustration. You will perceive, that two vessels were sent\r\nfrom Boston in the year 1787, on a voyage of discovery and commercial\r\nexperiment in general, but more particularly to try a fur trade with the\r\nRussian settlements, on the northwest coast of our continent, of which\r\nsuch wonders had been published in Captain Cook's voyages, that it excited\r\nsimilar expeditions from other countries also; and that the American\r\nvessels were expressly forbidden to touch at any Spanish port, but in\r\ncases of extreme distress. Accordingly, through the whole of their voyage\r\nthrough the extensive latitudes held by that crown, they never put into\r\nany port but in a single instance. In passing near the island of Juan\r\nFernandez, one of them was damaged by a storm, her rudder broken, her\r\nmasts disabled, and herself separated from her companion. She put into\r\nthe island to refit, and at the same time, to wood and water, of which she\r\nbegan to be in want. Don Blas Gonzalez, after examining her, and finding\r\nshe had nothing on board but provisions and charts, and that her distress\r\nwas real, permitted her to stay a few days, to refit and take in fresh\r\nsupplies of wood and water. For this act of common hospitality, he was\r\nimmediately deprived of his government, unheard, by superior order, and\r\nremains still under disgrace. We pretend not to know the regulations of\r\nthe Spanish government, as to the admission of foreign vessels into the\r\nports of their colonies; but the generous character of the nation is a\r\nsecurity to us, that their regulations can, in no instance, run counter to\r\nthe laws of nature; and among the first of her laws, is that which bids\r\nus to succor those in distress. For an obedience to this law, Don Blas\r\nappears to have suffered; and we are satisfied, it is because his case\r\nhas not been able to penetrate to his Majesty's ministers, at least in its\r\ntrue colors. We would not choose to be committed by a formal solicitation,\r\nbut we would wish you to avail yourself of any good opportunity of\r\nintroducing the truth to the ear of the minister, and of satisfying him,\r\nthat a redress of this hardship on the Governor, would be received here\r\nwith pleasure, as a proof of respect to those laws of hospitality which\r\nwe would certainly observe in a like case, as a mark of attention towards\r\nus, and of justice to an individual for whose sufferings we cannot but\r\nfeel.\r\n\r\nWith the present letter, you will receive the public and other papers,\r\nas usual, and I shall thank you in return, for a regular communication of\r\nthe best gazettes published in Madrid.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GRAND.\r\n\r\n                                                  New York, April 23, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--You may remember that we were together at the Hotel de La\r\nMonnoye, to see Mr. Drost strike coins in his new manner, and that you\r\nwere so kind as to speak with him afterwards on the subject of his coming\r\nto America. We are now in a condition to establish a mint, and should\r\nbe desirous of engaging him in it. I suppose him to be at present in the\r\nservice of Watts and Bolton, the latter of whom you may remember to have\r\nbeen present with us at the Monnoye. I know no means of communicating our\r\ndispositions to Drost so effectually as through your friendly agency,\r\nand therefore take the liberty of asking you to write to him, to know\r\nwhat emoluments he receives from Watts and Bolton, and whether he would\r\nbe willing to come to us for the same? If he will, you may give him an\r\nexpectation, but without an absolute engagement, that we will call for\r\nhim immediately, and that with himself, we may probably take and pay him\r\nfor all the implements of coinage he may have, suited to our purpose. If\r\nhe asks higher terms, he will naturally tell you so, and what they are;\r\nand we must reserve a right to consider of them. In either case, I will\r\nask your answer as soon as possible. I need not observe to you, that this\r\nnegotiation should be known to nobody but yourself, Drost and Mr. Short.\r\nThe good old Dr. Franklin, so long the ornament of our country, and I may\r\nsay, of the world, has at length closed his eminent career. He died on the\r\n17th instant, of an imposthume of his lungs, which having suppurated and\r\nburst, he had not strength to throw off the matter, and was suffocated by\r\nit. His illness from this imposthume was of sixteen days. Congress wear\r\nmourning for him, by a resolve of their body.\r\n\r\nI beg you to present my friendly respects to Madame Grand, the elder and\r\nyounger, and to your son, and believe me to be, with sentiments of great\r\nesteem and attachment, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA LUZERNE.\r\n\r\n                                                  New York, April 30, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,--When in the course of your legation to the United States, your\r\naffairs rendered it necessary that you should absent yourself awhile from\r\nthat station, we flattered ourselves with the hope that that absence\r\nwas not final. It turned out, in event, that the interests of your\r\nsovereign called for your talents and the exercise of your functions, in\r\nanother quarter. You were pleased to announce this to the former Congress\r\nthrough their Secretary for Foreign Affairs, at a time when that body was\r\nclosing its administration, in order to hand it over to a government then\r\npreparing on a different model. This government is now formed, organized,\r\nand in action; and it considers among its earliest duties, and assuredly\r\namong its most cordial, to testify to you the regret which the people and\r\ngovernment of the United States felt at your removal from among them; a\r\nvery general and sincere regret, and tempered only by the consolation of\r\nyour personal advancement, which accompanied it. You will receive, Sir,\r\nby order of the President of the United States, as soon as they can be\r\nprepared, a medal and chain of gold, of which he desires your acceptance,\r\nin token of their esteem, and of the sensibility with which they will ever\r\nrecall your legation to their memory.\r\n\r\nBut as this compliment may hereafter be rendered to other missions, from\r\nwhich yours was distinguished by eminent circumstances, the President\r\nof the United States wishes to pay you the distinguished tribute of an\r\nexpress acknowledgment of your services, and our sense of them. You came\r\nto us, Sir, through all the perils which encompassed us on all sides.\r\nYou found us struggling and suffering under difficulties, as singular and\r\ntrying as our situation was new and unprecedented. Your magnanimous nation\r\nhad taken side with us in the conflict, and yourself became the centre\r\nof our common councils, the link which connected our common operations.\r\nIn that position you labored without ceasing, till all our labors were\r\ncrowned with glory to your nation, freedom to ours, and benefit to both.\r\nDuring the whole, we had constant evidence of your zeal, your abilities,\r\nand your good faith. We desire to convey this testimony of it home to your\r\nown breast, and to that of your sovereign, our best and greatest friend;\r\nand this I do, Sir, in the name, and by the express instruction of the\r\nPresident of the United States.\r\n\r\nI feel how flattering it is to me, Sir, to be the organ of the public\r\nsense on this occasion, and to be justified by that office, in adding to\r\ntheirs, the homage of those sentiments of respect and esteem with which\r\nI have the honor to be, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                                  New York, April 30, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--My last letter to you was of the 6th instant, acknowledging the\r\nreceipt of your favors of the 2d and 6th of January. Since that, Mr. Jay\r\nhas put into my hands yours of the 12th of January, and I have received\r\nyour note of February the 10th, accompanying some newspapers.\r\n\r\nMine of the 6th covered the President's letter to the King for my recall,\r\nand my letters of leave for myself and of credence to you, for the Count\r\nde Montmorin, with copies of them for your information. Duplicates of\r\nall these accompany the present; and an original commission for you as\r\nchargé des affaires, signed by the President. At the date of my former\r\nletters, I had not had time to examine with minuteness the proper form of\r\ncredentials under our new Constitution: I governed myself, therefore, by\r\nforeign precedents, according to which a chargé des affaires is furnished\r\nwith only a letter of credence from one minister of Foreign Affairs to the\r\nother. Further researches have shown me, that under our new Constitution,\r\nall commissions (or papers amounting to that) must be signed by the\r\nPresident. You will judge whether any explanation on this subject to M. de\r\nMontmorin be necessary. I enclose you also the copy of a letter written to\r\nthe Marquis de La Luzerne, to be communicated to the Count de Montmorin,\r\nand by him to the King, if he thinks proper.\r\n\r\nIt has become necessary to determine on a present proper to be given to\r\ndiplomatic characters on their taking leave of us; and it is concluded\r\nthat a medal and chain of gold will be the most convenient. I have,\r\ntherefore, to ask the favor of you to order the dies to be engraved with\r\nall the despatch practicable. The medal must be of thirty lines diameter,\r\nwith a loop on the edge to receive the chain. On one side, must be the\r\narms of the United States, of which I send you a written description,\r\nand several impressions in wax to render that more intelligible; round\r\nthem, as a legend, must be \"The United States of America.\" The device of\r\nthe other side we do not decide on. One suggestion has been a Columbia\r\n(a fine female figure) delivering the emblems of peace and commerce to a\r\nMercury, with a legend \"Peace and Commerce\" circumscribed, and the date\r\nof our republic, to wit, 4th July, MDCCLXXVI., subscribed as an exergum;\r\nbut having little confidence in our own ideas in an art not familiar here,\r\nthey are only suggested to you, to be altered, or altogether postponed\r\nto such better device as you may approve on consulting with those who are\r\nin the habit and study of medals. Duvivier and Dupré seem to be the best\r\nworkmen; perhaps the last is the best of the two.\r\n\r\nThe public papers which accompany this, will give you fully the news of\r\nthis quarter.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n                                                    New York, May 30, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I at length find myself, though not quite well, yet\r\nsufficiently so to resume business in a moderate degree. I have,\r\ntherefore, to answer your two favors of April 23 and May 3, and in the\r\nfirst place to thank you for your attention to the Paccan, Gloucester and\r\nEuropean walnuts, which will be great acquisitions at Monticello. I will\r\nstill ask your attention to Mr. Foster's boring machines, lest he should\r\ngo away suddenly, and the opportunity of getting it be lost. I enquired of\r\nMr. Hamilton the quantity of coal imported; but he tells me there are not\r\nreturns as yet sufficient to ascertain it; but as soon as there shall be I\r\nshall be informed. I am told there is a considerable prejudice against our\r\ncoal in these Northern States. I do not know whence it proceeds; perhaps\r\nfrom the want of attention to the different species, and an ignorant\r\napplication of them to cross purposes. I have not begun my meteorological\r\ndiary, because I have not yet removed to the house I have taken. I remove\r\nto-morrow; but as far as I can judge from its aspects, there will not be\r\none position to be had for the thermometer free from the influence of the\r\nsun both morning and evening. However, as I go into it only till I can get\r\na better, I shall hope ere long to find a less objectionable situation.\r\nYou know that during my short stay at Monticello I kept a diary of the\r\nweather. Mr. Madison has just received one comprehending the same period,\r\nkept at his father's at Orange. The hours of observation were the same,\r\nand he has the fullest confidence in the accuracy of the observer. All the\r\nmorning observations in Orange are lower than those of Monticello, from\r\none to, I believe, fifteen or sixteen degrees; the afternoon observations\r\nare near as much higher as those of Monticello. Nor will the variations\r\npermit us to ascribe them to any supposed irregularities in either tube;\r\nbecause, in that case, at the same point the variation would always be\r\nthe same, which it is not. You have often been sensible that in the\r\nafternoon, or rather evening, the air has become warmer in ascending\r\nthe mountain. The same is true in the morning. This might account for a\r\nhigher station of the mercury in the morning observations at Monticello.\r\nAgain, when the air is equally dry in the lower and higher situations,\r\nwhich may be supposed the case in the warmest part of the day, the\r\nmercury should be lower on the latter, because, all other circumstances\r\nthe same, the nearer the common surface the warmer the air. So that on a\r\nmountain it ought really to be warmer in the morning and cooler in the\r\nheat of the day than on the common plain, but not in so great a degree\r\nas these observations indicate. As soon as I am well enough I intend to\r\nexamine them more accurately. Your resolution to apply to the study of\r\nthe law, is wise in my opinion, and at the same time to mix with it a\r\ngood degree of attention to the farm. The one will relieve the other. The\r\nstudy of the law is useful in a variety of points of view. It qualifies a\r\nman to be useful to himself, to his neighbors, and to the public. It is\r\nthe most certain stepping-stone to preferment in the political line. In\r\npolitical economy, I think Smith's Wealth of Nations the best book extant;\r\nin the science of government, Montesquieu's Spirit of Laws is generally\r\nrecommended. It contains, indeed, a great number of political truths; but\r\nalso an equal number of heresies: so that the reader must be constantly\r\non his guard. There has been lately published a letter of Helvetius, who\r\nwas the intimate friend of Montesquieu, and whom he consulted before the\r\npublication of his book. Helvetius advised him not to publish it; and in\r\nthis letter to a friend he gives us a solution for the mixture of truth\r\nand error found in this book. He says Montesquieu was a man of immense\r\nreading; that he had commonplaced all his reading, and that his object\r\nwas to throw the whole contents of his commonplace book into systematical\r\norder, and to show his ingenuity by reconciling the contradictory facts\r\nit presents. Locke's little book on Government, is perfect as far as it\r\ngoes. Descending from theory to practice there is no better book than\r\nthe Federalist. Burgh's Political Disquisitions are good also, especially\r\nafter reading De Lome. Several of Hume's Political Essays are good. There\r\nare some excellent books of theory written by Turgot and the economists of\r\nFrance. For parliamentary knowledge, the Lex Parliamentaria is the best\r\nbook. On my return to Virginia in the fall, I cannot help hoping some\r\npracticable plan may be devised for your settling in Albemarle, should\r\nyour inclination lead you to it. Nothing could contribute so much to my\r\nhappiness were it at the same time consistent with yours. You might get\r\ninto the Assembly for that county as soon as you should please.\r\n\r\nA motion has been made in the Senate to remove the Federal Government to\r\nPhiladelphia. There was a trial of strength on a question for a week's\r\npostponement. On that it was found there would be eleven for the removal,\r\nand thirteen against it. The motion was therefore withdrawn and made in\r\nthe other house, where it is still depending, and of very uncertain event.\r\nThe question of the assumption is again brought on. The parties were so\r\nnearly equal on the former trial that it is very possible, that with some\r\nmodifications, it may yet prevail. The tonnage bill will probably pass,\r\nand must, I believe, produce salutary effects. It is a mark of energy\r\nin our government, in a case, I believe, where it cannot be parried. The\r\nFrench revolution still goes on well, though the danger of a suspension\r\nof payments is very imminent. Their appeal to the inhabitants of their\r\ncolonies to say on what footing they wish to be placed, will end, I hope,\r\nin our free admissions into their islands with our produce. This precedent\r\nmust have consequences. It is impossible the world should continue long\r\ninsensible to so evident a truth as that the right to have commerce and\r\nintercourse with our neighbors, is a natural right. To suppress this\r\nneighborly intercourse is an exercise of force, which we shall have a\r\njust right to remove when the superior force. Dear Sir, your affectionate\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                                    New York, June 6, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Having written to you so lately as the 27th of May, by M. de\r\nCrevecoeur, I have little new to communicate. My headache still continues\r\nin a slight degree, but I am able to do business. To-morrow I go on a\r\nsailing party of three or four days with the President. I am in hopes\r\nof being relieved entirely by the sickness I shall probably encounter.\r\nThe President is perfectly re-established, and looks better than before\r\nhis illness. The question of removal to Philadelphia was carried in the\r\nHouse of Representatives by 38, against 22. It is thought the Senate\r\nwill be equally divided, and consequently that the decision will rest on\r\nthe Vice-President, who will be himself divided between his own decided\r\ninclinations to stay here, and the unpopularity of being the sole obstacle\r\nto what appears the wish of so great a majority of the people expressed\r\nby proportional representation. Rhode Island has at length acceded to the\r\nUnion by a majority of two voices only, in their convention. Her Senators\r\nwill be here in about ten days or a fortnight. The opposers of removal\r\nin the Senate try to draw out time till their arrival. Therefore, they\r\nhave connected the resolution of the lower House with a bill originated\r\nwith them to fix a permanent residence, and have referred both to the\r\nsame committee. Deaths are, Colonel Bland at this place, and old Colonel\r\nCorbin in Virginia. The naming a minister for Paris, awaits the progress\r\nof a bill before the legislature. They will probably adjourn to the 1st of\r\nDecember, as soon as they have got through the money business. The funding\r\nbill is passed, by which the President is authorized to borrow money for\r\ntransferring our foreign debt. But the ways and means bill being not yet\r\npassed, the loan cannot be commenced till the appropriations of revenue\r\nare made, which is to give credit to the loan.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRemember me to all my friends, and be assured of the sincere esteem of,\r\ndear Sir, your affectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL GEORGE MASON.\r\n\r\n                                                   New York, June 13, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I have deferred acknowledging the receipt of your favor of\r\nMarch 16th, expecting daily that the business of the Consulships would\r\nhave been finished. But this was delayed by the President's illness, and a\r\nvery long one of my own, so that it is not till within these two or three\r\ndays that it has been settled. That of Bordeaux is given to Mr. Fenwick,\r\naccording to your desire. The commission is making out and will be signed\r\nto-morrow or next day.\r\n\r\nI intended fully to have had the pleasure of seeing you at Gunstan Hall\r\non my way here, but the roads being so bad that I was obliged to leave\r\nmy own carriage to get along as it could, and to take my passage in the\r\nstage. I could not deviate from the stage road. I should have been happy\r\nin a conversation with you on the subject of our new government, of which,\r\nthough I approve of the mass, I would wish to see some amendments, further\r\nthan those which have been proposed, and fixing it more surely on a\r\nrepublican basis. I have great hopes that pressing forward with constancy\r\nto these amendments, they will be obtained before the want of them will\r\ndo any harm. To secure the ground we gain, and gain what more we can,\r\nis, I think, the wisest course. I think much has been gained by the late\r\nconstitution; for the former was terminating in anarchy, as necessarily\r\nconsequent to inefficiency. The House of Representatives have voted to\r\nremove to Baltimore, by a majority of 53, against 6. This was not the\r\neffect of choice, but of confusion into which they had been brought by\r\nthe event of other questions, and their being hampered with the rules of\r\nthe House. It is not certain what will be the vote of the Senate. Some\r\nhope an opening will be given to convert it into a vote of the temporary\r\nseat at Philadelphia, and the permanent one at Georgetown. The question\r\nof assumption will be brought on again, and its event is doubtful. Perhaps\r\nits opponents would be wiser to be less confident in their success, and to\r\ncompromise by agreeing to assume the State debts still due to individuals,\r\non condition of assuming to the States at the same time what they have\r\npaid to individuals, so as to put the States in the shoes of those of\r\ntheir creditors whom they have paid off. Great objections lie to this,\r\nbut not so great as to an assumption of the unpaid debts only. My duties\r\npreventing me from mingling in these questions, I do not pretend to be\r\nvery competent to their decision. In general, I think it necessary to give\r\nas well as take in a government like ours. I have some hope of visiting\r\nVirginia in the fall, in which case I shall still flatter myself with the\r\npleasure of seeing you; in the meantime, I am, with unchanged esteem and\r\nrespect, my dear Sir, your most obedient friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DAVID RITTENHOUSE.\r\n\r\n                                                   New York, June 14, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I enclosed you the day before yesterday a rough draught of\r\nthe report I had prepared on the subject of weights and measures. I have\r\nthis morning received from Mr. Short a proposition made by the Bishop of\r\nAutun to the National Assembly of France, on the same subject, which I\r\nenclose you, and will beg the favor of you to return it by post after you\r\nshall have perused it. He mentions that the latitude of 45°, as being a\r\nmiddle term between the equator and pole, had been proposed as the general\r\nstandard for measures, and he makes the proposition anew, and desires\r\nit may be made to England. As this degree of latitude is our northern\r\nboundary, as it may form a link between us and Europe, and as the degree\r\nwhich shall otherwise give the standard is not otherwise very material,\r\nI have thought of proposing it in my report instead of the 38th degree. I\r\nhave in consequence gone over my calculations again upon the ground of a\r\npendulum of 36.-8.428. (Sir Isaac Newton's calculation for 45°) 39.14912\r\ninches giving a rod of 58.72368 inches, and reformed the tables (last page\r\nof the report), of which reformation I send you a copy. The alterations\r\nin the body of the work may be easily made from this. The Bishop says the\r\npendulum has been calculated for 45° to be 36.-8.52. this 1-10 of a line\r\nless than Sir Isaac Newton's, and the Bishop accordingly adds, that there\r\nmay be in this calculation an error of 1-10 of a line.\r\n\r\nI had taken no notice of the precaution of making the experiment of the\r\npendulum on the sea shore, because the highest mountain in the United\r\nStates would not add 1-5000 part to the length of the earth's radius, nor\r\n1-128 of an inch to the length of the pendulum; the highest part of the\r\nAndes indeed might add about 1-1000 to the earth's radius, and 1-25 of an\r\ninch to the pendulum; as it has been thought worth mention, I will insert\r\nit also.\r\n\r\nYour letter of April 20th, was duly attended to by me, but I fancy the\r\nsuccessor had been decided on before it was known to the public that there\r\nwould be a vacancy.\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem, my dear Sir, your sincere friend and humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DAVID RITTENHOUSE.\r\n\r\n                                                   New York, June 20, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I enclosed you on the 17th the alterations I had made in my\r\nreport in consequence of the Bishop of Autun's proposition, which had\r\ncome to my hands two days before. On the 18th, I received from Mr. Cutter\r\nin London a packet of newspapers, among which were the two enclosed,\r\ncontaining the speech in Parliament of Sir John Riggs Miller, on the\r\nsubject of weights and measures. I observe, he states the estimate of 39.2\r\nI. for the length of the pendulum as confessedly erroneous. I had adopted\r\nit from memory only, and before I had been able to get a single book of\r\nany kind, in the first part of the report, wherein I endeavor to ascertain\r\nand fix invariably the system of measures and weights now in use with us.\r\nBut before I proceeded to the second part, proposing a thorough reform,\r\nand reducing the whole to the decimal ratio, I had been able to procure\r\nhere a copy of the Principia, and so to recur to the fountain head for\r\nSir I. Newton's calculations, and then added the note, which you will find\r\npage 3 of the report, doubting what could have been the foundation of the\r\ncommon imputation of the estimate of 39.2 to Sir I. Newton, and stating\r\nthe grounds of that of 39.1682 for the latitude of 51° 31' of 39.1285 for\r\n38°, which I had at first adopted, and 39.14912 for 45°, which I took on\r\nreceiving the Bishop of Autun's proposition. I have now thought I might\r\nventure to take for granted, that the estimate of 39.2 is as erroneous as\r\nI had supposed it, and therefore to expunge it from the first branch of\r\nthe report, and substitute in its stead 39.1682; and to change a passage\r\nunder the head of \"Measures of length\" into the following form:\r\n\r\n\"They furnish no means to persons at a distance of knowing what this\r\nstandard is. This, however, is supplied by the evidence of the second\r\npendulum, which, according to the authority before quoted, being 39.1682\r\nI. for the latitude of London, and consequently the second rod for the\r\nsame latitude being 58.7523, we are first to find by actual trial the rod\r\nfor 45, and to add to that 287/10000 of an inch, or rather 3/10 of a line\r\n(which in practice will endanger less error than an attempt at so minute a\r\nfraction as 10,000th parts of an inch), this will give us the true measure\r\nof 58-3/4 English inches. Or, to shorten the operation, and yet obtain the\r\nresult we seek, let the standard rod of 45° be divided into 587-1/5 equal\r\nparts, and let each of these parts be declared a line, and ten lines an\r\ninch,\" &c.\r\n\r\nI propose also to strike out the note (page 3) before mentioned, and to\r\nsubstitute the following in its place:\r\n\r\n\"The length of the pendulum has been differently estimated by different\r\npersons. Knowing no reason to respect any of them more than Sir Isaac\r\nNewton for skill, care, or candor, I had adopted his estimate of\r\n39.149 I. for our northern limit of 45°, before I saw the different\r\npropositions of the Bishop of Autun, and Sir John Riggs Miller. The\r\nfirst of these gentlemen quotes Mairan's calculation for 48° 50', the\r\nlatitude of Paris, to wit, 504:257::72: to a 4th proportional, which\r\nwill be 36.71428=39.1923 inches. The difference between the pendulum for\r\n48° 50' and 45°, as calculated by Sir I. Newton, is .0112 I. so that the\r\npendulum for 45° would be estimated, according to the Bishop of Autun,\r\nat 39.1923-.0112=39.1811. Sir John Riggs Miller proposes 39.126, being\r\nGraham's determination for 51° 31', the latitude of London. The difference\r\nbetween the pendulum for 51° 31', and 45° by Sir I. Newton, is .019 I.,\r\nso that the pendulum for 45° should be estimated according to Sir J. R.\r\nMiller, at 39.126-.019=39.107 I. Now, dividing our respect between these\r\ntwo results, by taking their mean, to wit, (39.181 + 39.107)/2=39.144, we\r\nfind ourselves almost exactly with Sir I. Newton, whose estimate of 39.149\r\nwe had already adopted.\"\r\n\r\nI propose also to reform a passage under the head of Weights, in the first\r\nbranch of the report, to stand thus:\r\n\r\n\"Let it then be established, that an ounce is the weight of a cube of\r\nrain water of one-tenth of a foot, _or rather, that it is the thousandth\r\npart of the weight of a cubic foot of rain water_ weighed in the standard\r\ntemperature,\" &c.\r\n\r\nAll which I submit to your judgment, and I will ask you particularly\r\nto examine the numbers .0112 and .019, as I have no help here to find\r\nthem otherwise than by approximation. I have wished much, but in vain,\r\nEmerson's and Ferguson's books here. In short, I never was cut off from\r\nthe resources of my own books and papers at so unlucky a moment. There is\r\na Count Andriani, of Milan, here, who says there is a work on the subject\r\nof weights and measures published by Trisi of Milan. Perhaps you may\r\nhave it at Philadelphia, and be able to send it to me. Were it not for my\r\nconfidence in your assistance, I should not have ventured to take up this\r\nbusiness till I received my books.\r\n\r\nI am, my dear Sir, with great and sincere esteem, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                   New York, June 20, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--An attack of a periodical headache, which, though violent\r\nfor a few days only, yet kept me long in a lingering state, has hitherto\r\nprevented my sooner acknowledging the receipt of your favor of May 26. I\r\nhope the uneasiness of Mrs. Monroe and yourself has been removed by the\r\nre-establishment of your daughter. We have been in hopes of seeing her\r\nhere, and fear at length some change in her arrangements for that purpose.\r\n\r\nCongress has been long embarrassed by two of the most irritating questions\r\nthat ever can be raised among them: 1, the funding the public debt, and 2,\r\nthe fixing on a more central residence. After exhausting their arguments\r\nand patience on these subjects, they have for some time been resting on\r\ntheir oars, unable to get along as to these businesses, and indisposed to\r\nattend to anything else, till they are settled. And in fine, it has become\r\nprobable, that unless they can be reconciled by some plan of compromise,\r\nthere will be no funding bill agreed to. Our credit (raised by late\r\nprospects to be the first on the exchange at Amsterdam, where our paper\r\nis above par) will burst and vanish, and the States separate, to take care\r\nevery one of itself. This prospect appears probable to some well-informed\r\nand well-disposed minds. Endeavors are, therefore, using to bring about\r\na disposition to some mutual sacrifices. The assumption of State debts\r\nhas appeared as revolting to several States as their non-assumption to\r\nothers. It is proposed to strip the proposition of the injustice it would\r\nhave done by leaving the States who have redeemed much of their debts on\r\nno better footing than those who have redeemed none; on the contrary,\r\nit is recommended to assume a fixed sum, allotting a portion of it to\r\nevery State in proportion to its census. Consequently, every State will\r\nreceive exactly what they will have to pay, or they will be exonerated so\r\nfar by the general government's taking their creditors off their hands.\r\nThere will be no injustice then. But there will be the objection still,\r\nthat Congress must then lay taxes for those debts which would have been\r\nmuch better laid and collected by the State governments. And this is the\r\nobjection on which the accommodation now hangs with the non-assumptioners,\r\nmany of whom committed themselves in their advocation of the new\r\nConstitution, by arguments drawn from the improbability that Congress\r\nwould ever lay taxes where the States could do it separately. These\r\ngentlemen feel the reproaches which will be levelled at them personally.\r\nI have been, and still am of their opinion, that Congress should always\r\nprefer letting the States raise money in their own way, where it can be\r\ndone. But in the present instance, I see the necessity of yielding to\r\nthe cries of the creditors in certain parts of the Union; for the sake\r\nof union, and to save us from the greatest of all calamities, the total\r\nextinction of our credit in Europe. On the other hand, it is proposed\r\nto pass an act fixing the temporary residence of twelve or fifteen years\r\nat Philadelphia, and that at the end of that time, it shall stand _ipso\r\nfacto_, and without further declaration transferred to Georgetown. In\r\nthis way, there will be something to displease and something to soothe\r\nevery part of the Union but New York, which must be contented with what\r\nshe has had. If this plan of compromise does not take place, I fear one\r\ninfinitely worse, an unqualified assumption and the perpetual residence\r\non the Delaware. The Pennsylvania and Virginia delegates have conducted\r\nthemselves honorably and unexceptionably, on the question of residence.\r\nWithout descending to talk about bargains, they have seen that their true\r\ninterests lay in not listening to insidious propositions, made to divide\r\nand defect them, and we have seen them at times voting against their\r\nrespective wishes rather than separate.\r\n\r\nIn France, the revolution goes on surely but slowly. On the rest of the\r\ncontinent, a league is formed between Prussia, Poland, Sweden, and Turkey,\r\nand openly patronized by England and Holland, against the two empires, one\r\nof which is convulsed by internal divisions. But the last packet brings\r\nstill more interesting news. The day before the mail came away, a message\r\nwas sent to the two Houses by the King, complaining of the capture of\r\ntwo British ships at Nootka Sound by the Spaniards, under pretence of an\r\nexclusive right to that coast, that the King had demanded satisfaction,\r\nand in the meantime was arming, to enforce it. The Houses unanimously\r\npromised support, and it was evident they would accept nothing short of an\r\nextensive renunciation from Spain as to her American pretensions. Perhaps\r\nshe is determined to be satisfied with nothing but war, dismemberment\r\nof the Spanish empire, and annihilation of her fleet. Nor does her\r\ncountenance towards us clear up at all.\r\n\r\nI flatter myself with being in Virginia in the autumn. The particular\r\ntime depends upon too many contingencies to be now fixed. I shall hope\r\nthe pleasure of seeing yourself and Mrs. Monroe either in Albemarle or\r\nwherever our route may cross each other. Present me affectionately to\r\nher and to my good neighbors generally, and be assured of the great and\r\nsincere esteem of, dear Sir, your affectionate friend and humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JOHN COFFIN JONES.\r\n\r\n                                                   New York, June 23, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,--I duly received your favor of May 1st, and communicated to the\r\nPresident the part relative to Mr. Laneguy, who would have been disposed\r\nto pay all possible respect to your recommendation. The first rule on that\r\nsubject was to appoint a native Consul wherever a good one would accept\r\nof it; but where no native could be found, the person in possession was\r\nconfirmed. Dr. Franklin had appointed a Mr. Cathalan as agent, early in\r\nthe war, a very substantial merchant of Marseilles. He and his son have\r\npaid great attention to our concerns there, had much trouble, and no\r\nemolument from it. It was thought unjust to remove him without cause. The\r\ncommission is given to the son, as being otherwise well qualified, and\r\nparticularly as understanding well our language and usages, acquired by a\r\nresidence in England. A bill which may be called the true navigation act\r\nfor the United States, is before Congress, and will probably pass. I hope\r\nit will lay the foundation of a due share of navigation for us. I am, with\r\ngreat esteem, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\n                                                   New York, June 23, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I arrived at this place the latter end of March, and undertook\r\nthe office to which the President had been pleased to appoint me, of\r\nSecretary of State, which comprehends that of Foreign Affairs. Before I\r\nhad got through the most pressing matters which had been accumulating, a\r\nlong illness came upon me, and put it out of my power for many weeks to\r\nacknowledge the receipt of your letters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are much pleased to learn the credit of our paper at Amsterdam. We\r\nconsider it as of the first importance, to possess the first credit\r\nthere, and to use it little. Our distance from the wars of Europe, and\r\nour disposition to take no part in them, will, we hope, enable us to\r\nkeep clear of the debts which they occasion to other powers. It will be\r\nwell for yourself and our bankers to keep in mind always, that a great\r\ndistinction is made here, between our foreign and domestic paper. As to\r\nthe foreign, Congress is considered as the representative of one party\r\nonly, and I think I can say with truth, that there is not one single\r\nindividual in the United States, either in or out of office, who supposes\r\nthey can ever do anything which might impair their foreign contracts. But\r\nwith respect to domestic paper, it is thought that Congress, being the\r\nrepresentative of both parties, may shape their contracts so as to render\r\nthem practicable, only seeing that substantial justice be done. This\r\ndistinction will explain to you their proceedings on the subject of their\r\ndebts. The funding their foreign debts, according to express contract,\r\npassed without a debate and without a dissenting voice. The modelling and\r\nfunding the domestic debt, occasions great debates, and great difficulty.\r\nThe bill of ways and means was lately thrown out, because an excise was\r\ninterwoven into its texture; and another ordered to be brought in, which\r\nwill be clear of that. The assumption of the debts contracted by the\r\nStates to individuals, for services rendered the Union, is a measure\r\nwhich divides Congress greatly. Some think that the States could much\r\nmore conveniently levy taxes themselves to pay off these, and thus save\r\nCongress from the odium of imposing too heavy burthens in their name. This\r\nappears to have been the sentiment of the majority hitherto. But it is\r\npossible that modifications may be proposed, which may bring the measure\r\nyet into an acceptable form. We shall receive with gratitude the copy of\r\nRymer's Federa, which you are so good as to propose for the use of our\r\noffices here.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient,\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. LESLIE.\r\n\r\n                                                   New York, June 27, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,--I find among the letters to Mr. Jay, one on the subject of the\r\nvibrating rod thought of by you for a standard of measure; and I have\r\nreceived from Mr. Madison a manuscript pamphlet of yours on the same\r\nsubject. Congress having referred to me to propose a plan of invariable\r\nmeasures, I have considered maturely your proposition, and am abundantly\r\nsatisfied of its utility; so that if I can have your leave, I mean to\r\npropose in my report to adopt the rod in preference to the pendulum,\r\nmentioning expressly that we are indebted to you for the idea. Should\r\nthey concur with me in opinion, it is possible that in carrying it into\r\nexecution we may have occasion to engage your assistance in the proper\r\nadjustment of it, as well on account of your abilities in that line\r\ngenerally, as for the peculiar interest you would feel in the success of\r\nthe experiment. Mr. Cox's letter to Mr. Jay seems to imply that you had\r\ncommunicated your idea that I might avail myself of it in the subject\r\nreferred to me. But I think it justice to ask your express permission,\r\nand that you will be so good as to give me an answer by return of post.\r\nI am, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BENJ. VAUGHAN.\r\n\r\n                                                   New York, June 27, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Your favor of March 27th came duly to hand on the 12th\r\ninstant, as did your very valuable present, the dry rice, brought from the\r\nMoluccas, by Lieut. Blight. I immediately sent a few seeds to Virginia,\r\nwhere I am in hopes there would still be force of summer sufficient to\r\nmature it. I reserve a little for next spring, besides sowing some in\r\npots, from which I have now twenty-three young plants, just come up. I\r\nfear, however, there is not summer enough remaining here to ripen them,\r\nwithout the uncertain aid of a hot house. Upon your encouragement, I think\r\nI shall venture to write to Mr. Hinton Este, of Jamaica, on the subject.\r\nYou will have known that we had lost Dr. Franklin before your letter came\r\nto hand; consequently, the relation of Lieut. Blight's adventure, which\r\nyou were so kind as to send, rests with me.\r\n\r\nThough large countries within our Union are covered with the sugar maple,\r\nas heavily as can be conceived, and that this tree yields a sugar equal to\r\nthe best from the cane, yields it in great quantity, with no other labor\r\nthan what the women and girls can bestow, who attend to the drawing off\r\nand boiling the liquor, and the trees when skilfully tapped will last a\r\ngreat number of years, yet the ease with which we had formerly got cane\r\nsugar, had prevented our attending to this resource. Late difficulties in\r\nthe sugar trade have excited attention to our sugar trees, and it seems\r\nfully believed by judicious persons, that we cannot only supply our own\r\ndemand, but make for exportation. I will send you a sample of it, if I\r\ncan find a conveyance without passing it through the expensive one of the\r\npost. What a blessing to substitute a sugar which requires only the labor\r\nof children, for that which is said to render the slavery of the blacks\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nAn act of Congress authorizing the issuing of patents for new discoveries\r\nhas given a spring to invention beyond my conception. Being an instrument\r\nin granting the patents, I am acquainted with their discoveries. Many of\r\nthem indeed are trifling, but there are some of great consequence, which\r\nhave been proved by practice, and others which, if they stand the same\r\nproof, will produce great effect. Yesterday the man who built the famous\r\nbridge from Boston to Charlestown, was with me, asking a patent for a pile\r\nengine of his own construction. He communicated to me another fact, of\r\nwhich he makes no secret, and it is important. He was formerly concerned\r\nin ship building, but for thirty years past has been a bridge builder.\r\nHe had early in life observed, on examining worm-eaten ships, that the\r\nworms never eat within the seams where the corking chisel enters, and\r\nthe oil, &c. He had observed that the whaling vessels would be eaten to\r\na honey-comb, except a little above and below water, where the whale is\r\nbrought in contact with the vessel, and lies beating against it till it\r\nis cut up. A plank lying under water at a mill of his had been obliged to\r\nbe removed annually, because eaten up by the worms in the course of the\r\nyear. At length a plank was accidentally put down which for some purpose\r\nhad been thoroughly impregnated with oil. It remained seven years without\r\nbeing affected. Hence he took the idea of impregnating the timbers of his\r\nbridges thoroughly with oil, by heating the timber as deeply as possible,\r\nand doing it well in that state with the liver oil of the codfish. He\r\nhas practiced this for thirty years, and there is no instance of the worm\r\nattacking his timbers, while those in neighboring places are immediately\r\ndestroyed. He has used the liver oil of the cod, because very thick, and\r\ntherefore, as he supposes, more permanent in its effect. He supposes some\r\nother oils might do, but cannot speak of them experimentally. He says\r\nthere will be no difficulty in heating the planks of a ship after they are\r\nput on, as well as before; but I do not recollect his mentioning ever to\r\nhave tried it in the case of a ship.\r\n\r\nI am fixed here by the desire of my countrymen; consequently less in\r\nthe way of communications in letters and the arts than I used to be. The\r\ncontinuance of your communications in that way will now be received with\r\ndouble thankfulness.\r\n\r\nWe are told you are going to war. Peace and profit will, I hope, be our\r\nlot. A high price and sure market for our productions, and no want of\r\ncarrying business will, I hope, enable my countrymen to pay off both their\r\nprivate and public debts.\r\n\r\nI am, with sentiments of sincere esteem, dear Sir, your sincere friend\r\nand servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. GILMER.\r\n\r\n                                                   New York, June 27, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Doctor,--I have duly received your favor of May 21st, and thank\r\nyou for the details it contains. Congressional proceedings go on rather\r\nheavily. The question for assuming the State debts, has created greater\r\nanimosities than I ever yet saw take place on any occasion. There are\r\nthree ways in which it may yet terminate. 1. A rejection of the measure,\r\nwhich will prevent their funding any part of the public debt, and will\r\nbe something very like a dissolution of the government. 2. A bargain\r\nbetween the eastern members, who have it so much at heart, and the middle\r\nmembers, who are indifferent about it, to adopt those debts without\r\nany modification, on condition of removing the seat of government to\r\nPhiladelphia or Baltimore. 3. An adoption of them with this modification,\r\nthat the whole sum to be assumed shall be divided among the States in\r\nproportion to their census; so that each shall receive as much as they\r\nare to pay; and perhaps this might bring about so much good humor as to\r\ninduce them to give the temporary seat of government to Philadelphia, and\r\nthen to Georgetown permanently. It is evident that this last is the least\r\nbad of all the turns the thing can take. The only objection to it will\r\nbe, that Congress will then have to lay and collect taxes to pay these\r\ndebts, which could much better have been laid and collected by the State\r\ngovernments. This, though an evil, is a less one than any of the others\r\nin which it may issue, and will probably give us the seat of Government\r\nat a day not very distant, which will vivify our agriculture and commerce\r\nby circulating through our State an additional sum every year of half a\r\nmillion of dollars. When the last packet left England, there was great\r\nappearance of an immediate rupture with Spain. Should that take place,\r\nFrance will become a party. I hope peace and profit will be our share.\r\nPresent my best respects to Mrs. Gilmer, and my enquiring neighbors.\r\n\r\nI am, dear Doctor, your affectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. BOUDINOT.\r\n\r\n                                                   New York, June 29, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,--As it is desirable we should receive from our Consuls an exact\r\nreport of all our vessels with their cargoes which go to the countries\r\nof their residence, such fees appear necessary as may induce them to be\r\nwatchful that every such vessel is noted. At the same time, the fee should\r\nnot be so large as to induce them to connive at foreign vessels reporting\r\nthemselves as American, merely to give them the fee; five and ten dollars\r\nappear to me well proportioned.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in Europe I found there was a great want of some legal mode\r\nof taking and authenticating instruments and evidence in general, to be\r\nsent to this country; such as depositions, affidavits, copies of wills,\r\nrecords, deeds, powers of attorney, &c. I thought it would be proper, as\r\nsoon as we should have Consuls established, to make their authentications\r\nunder the seal of their office, good evidence in our courts. I take the\r\nliberty of submitting to you whether a clause for these purposes might\r\nnot be properly placed in this bill. I assure you the occasions for it\r\nare extremely frequent.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DAVID RITTENHOUSE.\r\n\r\n                                                   New York, June 30, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Your favor of the 25th came to hand last night, for which\r\nI give you many thanks. The conversion of 36.71428 pouces into 39.1923\r\ninches, was an error in division, and consequently the mean taken between\r\nthat and Graham's computation is wrong. It has rendered it necessary for\r\nme to suppress the note on that subject, and to put it into the form\r\nnow enclosed. In this I state the reason for adopting 11-3 pouces as\r\nthe equivalent of the English foot. It is so stated by D'Alembert in the\r\nEncyclopedie, and retained in the new Encyclopedie. To have changed it\r\nfor 11-3.11 Mashelynci's measure, would have obliged me to have formed\r\nall my calculations anew, which would have exposed me to new errors of\r\ncalculation; and added to the trouble and delay it would have occasioned,\r\ndid not seem worth while for so small a fraction as 11-100 of a line,\r\nor the 1227th of a foot. I suppose, too, that the operation concerting\r\nbetween the French and English will soon furnish us with a new and more\r\ncertain equation of their feet. I still like the rod rather than the\r\npendulum, because I do not know a single objection to it which does not\r\nlie to the pendulum, because it is clear of some objections to which that\r\nis liable, but most of all, because 1-5 of the second rod is much nearer\r\nthe present foot than 1-3 of the second pendulum. After all, should the\r\nFrench and English adopt the pendulum, we shall be free to do so also.\r\nI state on the enclosed paper a very loose answer to the 5th objection,\r\nwhich is the only one I can give. Can you suggest something more precise?\r\nAs there is an idea that Congress will rise about the middle of July, I\r\nshall only await the answer you will be so good as to make to this, and\r\nthen give in my report. This day, I fancy, will determine whether we are\r\nto be removed to Philadelphia or not; for though it will still be put to\r\nthe question several times before its ultimate passage, yet I think if\r\nthis day's vote of the Senate is favorable, it will pass safely through\r\nall the subsequent stages. It would have been a great comfort to me to\r\nhave been near you during the preparation of this business of weights and\r\nmeasures. It is much easier to avoid errors by having good information\r\nat first, than to unravel and correct them after they are committed. I\r\nrecommend to Congress the deferring to proceed on the report till the next\r\nsession, and reserve to myself an opening to add any new matter which may\r\noccur in the meantime.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your affectionate friend\r\nand servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                                    New York, July 1, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--A bill has passed two readings in the Senate for removing the\r\nseat of government to Philadelphia, there to remain ten years, and then\r\nto be established permanently in Georgetown. It is to receive its third\r\nreading to-day, and it depends on a single vote, yet I believe we may\r\ncount surely that it will pass that house. As it originated there, it will\r\nthen have to pass the lower house; where, however, I believe it is very\r\nsecure of a majority. I apprehend this news must reach you too late to\r\nsend my baggage to Philadelphia instead of this place; however, to take\r\nthe chance of any unexpected delay which may have attended its departure,\r\nI drop you this line by a vessel sailing this morning to Dunkirk, to\r\npray you (if my baggage is not already embarked, or so engaged for its\r\npassage as not to admit a change of destination), that you will have it\r\nsent to Philadelphia directly. The having to send it from one port to\r\nanother in the United States, costs as much nearly as the freight across\r\nthe Atlantic, besides the custom-house difficulties. I think it better to\r\nwait an opportunity from thence to Philadelphia, should there not be an\r\nimmediate one, than that it should make a double voyage. No time to add\r\nanything else, but that all is well. Adieu. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COL. M. LEWIS.\r\n\r\n                                                    New York, July 4, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I wrote you last on the 13th of June. The Senate have passed\r\nthe bill for fixing the residence of Congress at Philadelphia for ten\r\nyears, and then permanently at Georgetown; it has been read once or twice\r\nin the House of Representatives, and will be ultimately decided on the day\r\nafter to-morrow. I believe it will pass there by a considerable majority.\r\nI imagine we shall remove from hence early in September, which will\r\nconsequently be the time for my paying a short visit to Monticello. There\r\nis reason to expect a rupture has taken place between Spain and England.\r\nIf so, it will involve France, and so render the present war of Europe\r\nalmost universal there. I hope they will all see it their interest to let\r\nus make bread for them in peace, and to give us a good price for it. We\r\nhave every moral certainty that wheat will be high for years to come. I\r\ncannot, therefore, my dear Sir, omit to press, for myself, the going into\r\nthat culture as much as you think practicable. In Albemarle, I presume\r\nwe may lay aside tobacco entirely; and in Bedford, the more we can lay\r\nit aside the happier I shall be. I believe it cannot there be entirely\r\ndiscontinued, for want of open lands. I will also be obliged to you to\r\ngive such orders for preparing for the next year's crop in the plantation\r\ngiven to Mr. Randolph, as you would for me, were it to remain in my hands.\r\nI know he will be glad to have as much wheat sowed as possible. While good\r\ncrops of grain, and a good price for them, will prepare a good income,\r\nif we can avoid paying that away to the stores, all will be well. For\r\nthis purpose, it is vastly desirable to be getting under way with our\r\ndomestic cultivation and manufacture of hemp, flax, cotton and wool for\r\nthe negroes. If we may decide from past experience, we may safely say\r\nthat war and domestic manufacture are more gainful than peace and store\r\nsupplies. The present price of wheat here is a dollar a bushel.\r\n\r\nPresent my best esteem to Mrs. Lewis and your family. I am, dear Sir, your\r\naffectionate friend and humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. RUTLEDGE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                    New York, July 4, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Your favor of April 28 came to hand May 11, and found me under\r\na severe indisposition, which kept me from all business more than a month,\r\nand still permits me to apply but very sparingly. That of June 20 was\r\ndelivered me two days ago by young Mr. Middleton, whom I was very glad to\r\nsee, as I am everybody and everything which comes from you. It will give\r\nme great pleasure to be of any use to him, on his father's account as well\r\nas yours.\r\n\r\nIn yours of April 28 you mention Dr. Turnbull's opinion that force alone\r\ncan do our business with the Algerines. I am glad to have the concurrence\r\nof so good an authority on that point. I am clear myself that nothing\r\nbut a perpetual cruise against them, or at least for eight months of\r\nthe year, and for several years, can put an end to their piracies; and\r\nI believe that a confederacy of the nations not in treaty with them can\r\nbe effected, so as to make that perpetual cruise, or our share of it, a\r\nvery light thing, as soon as we shall have money to answer even a light\r\nthing; and I am in hopes this may shortly be the case. I participate\r\nfully of your indignation at the trammels imposed on our commerce with\r\nGreat Britain. Some attempts have been made in Congress, and others are\r\nstill making to meet their restrictions by effectual restriction on our\r\npart. It was proposed to double the foreign tonnage for a certain time,\r\nand after that to prohibit the exportation of our commodities in the\r\nvessels of nations not in treaty with us. This has been rejected. It is\r\nnow proposed to prohibit any nation from bringing or carrying in their\r\nvessels what may not be brought or carried in ours from or to the same\r\nports; also to prohibit those from bringing to us anything not of their\r\nown produce, who prohibit us from carrying to them anything but our own\r\nproduce. It is thought, however, that this cannot be carried. The fear\r\nis that it would irritate Great Britain were we to feel any irritation\r\nourselves. You will see by the debates of Congress that there are good men\r\nand bold men, and sensible men, who publicly avow these sentiments. Your\r\nobservations on the expediency of making short treaties, are most sound.\r\nOur situation is too changing and too improving to render an unchangeable\r\ntreaty expedient for us. But what are these enquiries on the part of the\r\nBritish minister which leads you to think he means to treat? May they\r\nnot look to some other object? I suspect they do; and can no otherwise\r\nreconcile all circumstances. I would thank you for a communication of any\r\nfacts on this subject.\r\n\r\nSome questions have lately agitated the minds of Congress more than the\r\nfriends of union on catholic principles would have wished. The general\r\nassumption of State debts has been as warmly demanded by some States,\r\nas warmly rejected by others. I hope still that this question maybe so\r\ndivested of the injustice imputed to it as to be compromised. The question\r\nof residence, you know, was always a heating one. A bill has passed the\r\nSenate for fixing this at Philadelphia ten years, and then at Georgetown;\r\nand it is rather probable it will pass the lower house. That question then\r\nwill be put to sleep for ten years; and this and the funding business\r\nbeing once out of the way, I hope nothing else may be able to call up\r\nlocal principles. If the war between Spain and England takes place, I\r\nthink France will inevitably be involved in it. In that case I hope the\r\nnew world will fatten on the follies of the old. If we can but establish\r\nthe armed neutrality for ourselves, we must become the carriers for all\r\nparties as far as we can raise vessels.\r\n\r\nThe President had a hair-breadth escape; but he is now perfectly\r\nre-established, and looks much better than before he was sick. I expect\r\ndaily to see your nephew, Mr. J. Rutledge, arrive here, as he wrote me by\r\nthe May packet that he would come in that of June. He is a very hopeful\r\nyoung man, sensible, well-informed, prudent and cool. Our southern sun\r\nhas been accused of sometimes sublimating the temper too highly. I wish\r\nall could think as coolly, but as soundly and firmly as you do. Adieu, my\r\ndear friend. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\n                                                   New York, July 13, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,--I wrote you last on the 23d of June, since which I have received\r\nyours of March the 24th to the 30th.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCongress are still engaged in their funding bills. The foreign debts did\r\nnot admit of any difference of opinion. They were settled by a single\r\nand unanimous vote; but the domestic debt, requiring modifications and\r\nsettlements, these produce great difference of opinion, and consequently\r\nretard the passage of the funding bill. The States had individually\r\ncontracted considerable debts for their particular defence, in addition to\r\nwhat was done by Congress. Some of the States have so exerted themselves\r\nsince the war, as to have paid off near the half of their individual\r\ndebts. Others have done nothing. The State creditors urge, that these\r\ndebts were as much for general purposes as those contracted by Congress,\r\nand insist that Congress shall assume and pay such of them as have not\r\nbeen yet paid by their own States. The States who have exerted themselves\r\nmost, find that, notwithstanding the great payments they have made, they\r\nshall by this assumption, still have nearly as much to pay as if they had\r\nnever paid anything. They are therefore opposed to it. I am in hopes a\r\ncompromise will be effected by a proportional assumption, which may reach\r\na great part of the debts, and leave still a part of them to be paid by\r\nthose States who have paid few or none of their creditors. This being once\r\nsettled, Congress will probably adjourn, and meet again in December, at\r\nPhiladelphia. The appearance of war between our two neighbors, Spain and\r\nEngland, would render a longer adjournment inexpedient.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient,\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. GILMER.\r\n\r\n                                                   New York, July 25, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Doctor,--I wrote you last on the 27th of June. Since that we have had\r\ngreat appearances of an explosion between Spain and England. Circumstances\r\nstill indicate war. The strongest fact against it is that a British\r\nambassador is actually gone to Madrid. If there be war, France will\r\nprobably embark in it. I do not think it can disturb her revolution, that\r\nis so far advanced as to be out of danger. Be these things as they may,\r\nthere will be war enough to ensure us great prices for wheat for years to\r\ncome, and if we are wise we shall become wealthy. McGillivray, and about\r\nthirty Creek chiefs, are here. We are in hopes this visit will ensure the\r\ncontinuance of peace with them. The assumption in a proportionate form\r\nis likely to pass. The sum to be assumed is twenty-one millions. Of this\r\nthree and a half millions are allotted to Virginia, being the exact sum\r\nit is supposed she will have to contribute of the whole assumption, and\r\nsufficient also to cover the whole of her remaining domestic debt. Being\r\ntherefore to receive exactly what she is to pay, she will neither lose nor\r\ngain by the measure. The principal objection now is, that all the debts,\r\ngeneral and State, will be to be raised by tax on imposts, which will\r\nthus be overburthened; whereas had the States been left to pay the debts\r\nthemselves, they could have done it by taxes on land and other property,\r\nwhich would thus have lightened the burthen on commerce. However, the\r\nmeasure was so vehemently called for by the State creditors in some parts\r\nof the Union, that it seems to be one of those cases where some sacrifice\r\nof opinion is necessary for the sake of peace. Congress will probably rise\r\nbetween the 6th and 13th of August. The President will soon after that go\r\nto Mount Vernon, and I shall take advantage of the interregnum to see my\r\nneighbors in Albemarle, and to meet my family there. I suppose it will be\r\nthe 1st of September before I can set out from this place, and shall take\r\nthat occasion of having my affairs removed hence to Philadelphia. Present\r\nme affectionately to Mrs. Gilmer and all my friends. Adieu, dear Doctor,\r\nyour sincere friend and humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                                   New York, July 26, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--My public letters to you have been of the 28th of March, the\r\n6th and 30th of April. Yours, which remain to be acknowledged, are of\r\nMarch the 9th, 17th, 29th, April the 4th, 12th, 23d, and May the 1st;\r\nbeing from No. 21 to 28 inclusive, except No. 23, which had come to hand\r\nbefore. I will state to you the dates of all your letters received by me,\r\nwith the times they have been received, and length of their passage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYou will perceive that they average eleven weeks and a half; that the\r\nquickest are of nine weeks, and the longest are of near eighteen weeks\r\ncoming. Our information through the English papers, is of about five\r\nor six weeks, and we generally remain as long afterwards in anxious\r\nsuspense, till the receipt of your letters may enable us to decide what\r\narticles of those papers have been true. As these come principally by the\r\nEnglish packet, I will take the liberty of asking you to write always by\r\nthat packet, giving a full detail of such events as may be communicated\r\nthrough that channel; and indeed most may. If your letters leave Paris\r\nnine or ten days before the sailing of the packet, we shall be able to\r\ndecide, on the moment, on the facts, true or false, with which she comes\r\ncharged. For communications of a secret nature, you will avail yourself\r\nof other conveyances, and you will be enabled to judge which are best,\r\nby the preceding statement. News from Europe is very interesting at this\r\nmoment, when it is so doubtful whether a war will take place between our\r\ntwo neighbors.\r\n\r\nCongress have passed an act for establishing the seat of government\r\nat Georgetown, from the year 1800, and in the meantime, to remove to\r\nPhiladelphia. It is to that place, therefore, that your future letters\r\nhad better be addressed. They have still before them the bill for funding\r\nthe public debts. That has been hitherto delayed by a question, whether\r\nthe debts contracted by the particular States for general purposes,\r\nshould, at once, be assumed by the General Government. A development of\r\ncircumstances, and more mature consideration, seem to have produced some\r\nchange of opinion on the subject. When it was first proposed, a majority\r\nwas against it. There is reason to believe, by the complexion of some\r\nlater votes, that the majority will now be for assuming these debts to\r\na fixed amount. Twenty-one millions of dollars are proposed. As soon\r\nas this point is settled, the funding bill will pass, and Congress will\r\nadjourn. That adjournment will probably be between the 6th and 13th of\r\nAugust. They expect it sooner. I shall then be enabled to inform you,\r\nultimately, on the subject of the French debt, the negotiations for\r\nthe payment of which will be referred to the executive, and will not be\r\nretarded by them an unnecessary moment. A bill has passed, authorizing the\r\nPresident to raise the salary of a chargé des affaires to four thousand\r\nfive hundred dollars, from the first day of July last. I am authorized\r\nby him to inform you, that yours will accordingly be at that rate, and\r\nthat you will be allowed for gazettes, translating or printing papers,\r\nwhere that shall be necessary, postage, couriers, and necessary aids to\r\npoor American _sailors_, in addition to the salary, and no charge of any\r\nother description, except where you may be directed to incur it expressly.\r\nI have thought it would be most agreeable to you to give you precise\r\ninformation, that you may be in no doubt in what manner to state your\r\naccounts. Be pleased to settle your account down to the 1st of July last,\r\nand state the balance then due, which will be to be paid out of the former\r\nfund. From that day downwards, a new account must be opened, because a new\r\nfund is appropriated to it, from that time. The expenses for the medals,\r\ndirected in my letter of April the 30th, must enter into the new account.\r\nAs I presume the die will be finished by the time you receive this, I\r\nhave to desire you will have a medal of gold struck for the Marquis de La\r\nLuzerne, and have put to it a chain of three hundred and sixty-five links,\r\neach link containing gold to the value of two dollars and a half, or\r\nthirteen livres and ten sous. The links to be of plain wire, so that their\r\nworkmanship may cost as it were nothing. The whole will make a present of\r\nlittle more than one thousand dollars, including the medal and chain. As\r\nsoon as done, be pleased to forward them by a safe hand to the Marquis de\r\nLa Luzerne, in the name of the President of the United States, informing\r\nhim that it is the one spoken of in my letter to him of April the 30th,\r\n1790. Say nothing to anybody of the value of the present, because that\r\nwill not always be the same, in all cases. Be so good as to have a second\r\nmedal of gold struck in the same die, and to send this second, together\r\nwith the dies, to Philadelphia, by the first safe person who shall be\r\npassing; no chain to be sent with this.\r\n\r\nWe are impatient to learn the progress and prospect of the Algerine\r\nbusiness. Do not let it languish a moment, nor leave us a moment\r\nuninformed of anything relative to it. It is in truth a tender business,\r\nand more felt as such in this, than in any other country. The suppression\r\nof the farms of tobacco, and the free importation of our salted\r\nprovisions, will merit all your attention. They are both of them objects\r\nof first-rate importance.\r\n\r\nThe following appointments of consuls have taken place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTheir jurisdictions, in general, extend to all places within the same\r\nallegiance, which are nearer to them than to the residence of any other\r\nconsul or vice-consul. As yet, only their commissions have been made\r\nout. General instructions await the passage of a bill now depending.\r\nMr. La Forest, at this place, remarked our appointment of consuls in\r\nthe French islands. In the first project of a convention proposed on\r\nthe part of France, the expressions reached expressly to the kingdom of\r\nFrance only. I objected to this in writing, as being narrower than the\r\ntwenty-ninth article of the treaty of amity, which was the basis of the\r\nconsular convention, and which had granted the appointment of consuls\r\nand vice-consuls, in their respective \"States and ports,\" generally, and\r\nwithout restriction. On this, the word \"France\" was struck out, and the\r\n\"dominions of the M. C. K.\" inserted everywhere. See the fifth, ninth,\r\ntwelfth, thirteenth and fifteenth articles particularly, of the copy of\r\nthe draughts of 1784 and 1788, as I had them printed side by side. The\r\nobject of this alteration was, the appointment of consuls in the free\r\nports allowed us in the French West Indies, where our commerce has greater\r\nneed of protection than anywhere. I mention these things that you may be\r\nprepared, should anything be said to you on the subject. I am persuaded\r\nthe appointment will contribute eminently to the preservation of harmony\r\nbetween us. These consuls will be able to prevent the misunderstandings\r\nwhich arise frequently now between the officers there and our traders,\r\nand which are doubtless much exaggerated and misrepresented to us by the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nI duly received the copy you were so kind as to send me of the Bishop of\r\nAutun's proposition, on the subject of weights and measures. It happened\r\nto arrive in the moment I was about giving in to Congress a report on the\r\nsame subject, which they had referred to me. In consequence of the Bishop\r\nof Autun's proposition, I made an alteration in my report, substituting\r\nforty-five degrees instead of thirty-eight degrees, which I had at\r\nfirst proposed as a standard latitude. I send you a copy of my report\r\nfor the Bishop, and another for M. Condorcet, Secretary of the Academy\r\nof Sciences. By taking the second pendulum or rod of the same latitude,\r\nfor the basis of our measures, it will at least furnish a common measure\r\nto which both our systems will refer, provided our experiments on the\r\npendulum or rod of forty-five degrees should yield exactly the same result\r\nwith theirs.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers, as usual, will accompany the present, which is to go by\r\nMr. Barrett.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem and attachment, dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\n                                                  New York, August 2, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--This letter will be delivered to you by Colonel Humphreys,\r\nwhose character is so well known to you as to need no recommendations\r\nfrom me. The present appearances of war between our two neighbors Spain\r\nand England, cannot but excite all our attention. The part we are to act\r\nis uncertain, and will be difficult. The unsettled state of our dispute\r\nwith Spain, may give a turn to it very different from what we would\r\nwish. As it is important that you should be fully apprized of our way of\r\nthinking on this subject, I have sketched, in the enclosed paper, general\r\nheads of consideration arising from present circumstances. These will\r\nbe readily developed by your own reflections, and in conversations with\r\nColonel Humphreys; who, possessing the sentiments of the executive on\r\nthis subject, being well acquainted with the circumstances of the Western\r\ncountry in particular, and of the state of our affairs in general, comes\r\nto Madrid expressly for the purpose of giving you a thorough communication\r\nof them. He will, therefore, remain there as many days or weeks as may\r\nbe necessary for this purpose. With this information, written and oral,\r\nyou will be enabled to meet the minister in conversations on the subject\r\nof the navigation of the Mississippi, to which we wish you to lead his\r\nattention immediately. Impress him thoroughly with the necessity of an\r\nearly, and even an immediate settlement of this matter, and of a return\r\nto the field of negotiation for this purpose; and though it must be\r\ndone delicately, yet he must be made to understand unequivocally, that a\r\nresumption of the negotiation is not desired on our part, unless he can\r\ndetermine, in the first opening of it, to yield the immediate and full\r\nenjoyment of that navigation. (I say nothing of the claims of Spain to our\r\nterritory north of the thirty-first degree, and east of the Mississippi.\r\nThey never merited the respect of an answer; and you know it has been\r\nadmitted at Madrid, that they were not to be maintained.) It may be\r\nasked, what need of negotiation, if the navigation is to be ceded at all\r\nevents? You know that the navigation cannot be practised without a port,\r\nwhere the sea and river vessels may meet and exchange loads, and where\r\nthose employed about them may be safe and unmolested. The right to use a\r\nthing, comprehends a right to the means necessary to its use, and without\r\nwhich it would be useless. The fixing on a proper port, and the degree of\r\nfreedom it is to enjoy in its operations, will require negotiation, and\r\nbe governed by events. There is danger, indeed, that even the unavoidable\r\ndelay of sending a negotiator here, may render the mission too late for\r\nthe preservation of peace. It is impossible to answer for the forbearance\r\nof our western citizens. We endeavor to quiet them with the expectation\r\nof an attainment of their rights by peaceable means. But should they, in\r\na moment of impatience, hazard others, there is no saying how far we may\r\nbe led; for neither themselves nor their rights will ever be abandoned by\r\nus.\r\n\r\nYou will be pleased to observe, that we press these matters warmly and\r\nfirmly, under this idea, that the war between Spain and Great Britain will\r\nbe begun before you receive this; and such a moment must not be lost. But\r\nshould an accommodation take place, we retain, indeed, the same object and\r\nthe same resolutions unalterably; but your discretion will suggest, that\r\nin that event, they must be pressed more softly, and that patience and\r\npersuasion must temper your conferences, till either these may prevail, or\r\nsome other circumstance turn up, which may enable us to use other means\r\nfor the attainment of an object which we are determined, in the end, to\r\nobtain at every risk.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient,\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE PINTO.\r\n\r\n                                                  New York, August 7, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,--Under cover of the acquaintance I had the honor of contracting\r\nwith you, during the negotiations we transacted together in London,\r\nI take the liberty of addressing you the present letter. The friendly\r\ndispositions you were then pleased to express towards this country, which\r\nwere sincerely and reciprocally felt on my part towards yours, flatter\r\nme with the hope you will assist in maturing a subject for their common\r\ngood. As yet, we have not the information necessary to present it to you\r\nformally, as the minister of her most faithful Majesty. I beg, therefore,\r\nthat this letter may be considered as between two individual friends of\r\ntheir respective countries, preliminary to a formal proposition, and meant\r\nto give an acceptable shape to that.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary, with your Excellency, to go through the history of\r\nour first experiment in government; the result of which was, a want of\r\nsuch tone in the governing powers, as might effect the good of those\r\ncommitted to their care. The nation become sensible of this, have changed\r\nits organization, made a better distribution of its powers, and given\r\nto them more energy and independence. The new government has now, for\r\nsome time, been under way; and so far, gives a confidence that it will\r\nanswer its purposes. Abuses under the old forms, have led us to lay the\r\nbasis of the new, in a rigorous economy of the public contributions.\r\nThis principle will show itself in our diplomatic establishments; and\r\nthe rather, as at such a distance from Europe, and with such an ocean\r\nbetween us, we hope to meddle little in its quarrels or combinations. Its\r\npeace and its commerce are what we shall court; and to cultivate these,\r\nwe propose to place at the courts of Europe most interesting to us,\r\ndiplomatic characters of economical grade, and shall be glad to receive\r\nlike ones in exchange. The important commerce carried on between your\r\ncountry and ours, and the proofs of friendly disposition towards us which\r\nher Majesty has manifested, induce us to wish for such an exchange with\r\nher, to express our sensibility at the intimations heretofore received\r\nof her readiness to meet our wish in this point, and our regret at the\r\ndelay which has proceeded from the circumstances before touched on. The\r\ngrade to be exchanged is the present question, and that on which I ask a\r\nfriendly and informal consultation with you. That of chargé des affaires,\r\nis the one we would prefer. It is that we employ at the court of Madrid.\r\nBut it has been said, that by the etiquette of your court, that grade\r\ncannot be received there under a favorable countenance. Something like\r\nthis existed at the court of Madrid. But his most Catholic Majesty, in\r\nconsideration of our peculiar circumstances, dispensed with a general\r\nrule in our favor and in our particular case; and our chargé des affaires\r\nthere, enjoys at court the privileges, the respect and favor due to a\r\nfriendly nation, to a nation whom distance and difference of circumstances\r\nliberate, in some degree, from an etiquette, to which it is a stranger\r\nat home as well as abroad. The representative of her Majesty here, under\r\nwhatever name mutual convenience may designate him, shall be received\r\nin the plentitude of friendship and favor. May we not ask a reciprocal\r\ntreatment of ours with you? The nations of Europe have already seen the\r\nnecessity of distinguishing America from Europe, even in their treaties;\r\nand a difference of commerce, of government, of condition and character,\r\nmust every day evince, more and more, the impracticability of involving\r\nthem under common regulations. Nor ought a difference of arrangement with\r\nrespect to us, to excite claims from others whose circumstances bear no\r\nsimilitude to ours.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to submit these considerations to your Excellency's wisdom and\r\ngoodness. You will see them to be such as could not be offered formally.\r\nThey must shield themselves under the protection of those sentiments\r\nof veneration and esteem with which your character heretofore inspired\r\nme, and which I flattered myself were not merely indifferent to you.\r\nBe so good as to honor with a conference hereon, the bearer, Colonel\r\nHumphreys (who was known to you in London), a gentleman who has long been\r\nof the President's family, and whose worth has acquired so much of our\r\nconfidence, that whatever shall be arranged with him, on this subject,\r\nmay be considered as settled. Presuming on a continuance of her Majesty's\r\ndispositions, accept this private assurance that a proper person shall\r\nbe appointed in due form to reside with you, as soon as we shall know the\r\nresult of your deliberations with Colonel Humphreys, whom I beg leave to\r\npresent to your notice; adding the homage of those sentiments of respect\r\nand attachment with which I have the honor to be, your Excellency's most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n                                                  New York, August 7, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,--The President of the United States, desirous of availing his country\r\nof the talents of its best citizens in their respective lines, has thought\r\nproper to nominate you consul for the United States, at the port of\r\nLondon. The extent of our commercial and political connections with that\r\ncountry, marks the importance of the trust he confides to you, and the\r\nmore, as we have no diplomatic character at that court. I shall say more\r\nto you in a future letter on the extent of the consular functions, which\r\nare, in general, to be confined to the superintendence and patronage of\r\ncommerce and navigation; but in your position, we must desire somewhat\r\nmore. Political intelligence from that country is interesting to us in\r\na high degree. We must, therefore, ask you to furnish us with this as\r\nfar as you shall be able; to send us moreover the gazette of the court,\r\nWoodfall's parliamentary paper, Debrett's parliamentary register; and\r\nto serve sometimes as a centre for our correspondences with other parts\r\nof Europe, by receiving and forwarding letters sent to your care. It\r\nis desirable that we be annually informed of the extent to which the\r\nBritish fisheries are carried on within each year, stating the number and\r\ntonnage of the vessels, and the number of men employed in the respective\r\nfisheries, to wit, the northern and southern whale fisheries, and the cod\r\nfishery. I have as yet no statement of them for the year 1789, with which,\r\ntherefore, I will thank you to begin. While the press of seamen continues,\r\nour seamen in ports nearer to you than to Liverpool, (where Mr. Maury\r\nis consul,) will need your protection. The liberation of those impressed\r\nshould be desired of the proper authority, with due firmness, yet always\r\nin temperate and respectful terms, in which way, indeed, all applications\r\nto government should be made.\r\n\r\nThe public papers herein desired may come regularly, once a month, by\r\nthe British packet, and intermediately, by any vessels bound directly\r\neither to Philadelphia or New York. All expenses incurred for papers and\r\npostages, shall be paid at such intervals as you choose, either here, on\r\nyour order, or by bill on London, whenever you transmit to me an account.\r\n\r\nThere was a bill brought into the legislature for the establishment of\r\nsome regulations in the consular offices; but it is postponed to the next\r\nsession. That bill proposed some particular fees for particular services.\r\nThey were, however, so small, as to be no object. As there will be little\r\nor no legal emolument annexed to the office of consul, it is, of course,\r\nnot expected that it shall render any expense incumbent on him.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                                 New York, August 10, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--This letter, with the very confidential papers it encloses,\r\nwill be delivered to you by Mr. Barrett with his own hands. If there be\r\nno war between Spain and England, they need be known to yourself alone.\r\nBut if that war be begun, or whenever it shall begin, we wish you to\r\ncommunicate them to the Marquis de La Fayette, on whose assistance we know\r\nwe can count in matters which interest both our countries. He and you\r\nwill consider how far the contents of these papers may be communicated\r\nto the Count de Montmorin, and his influence be asked with the court of\r\nMadrid. France will be called into the war, as an ally, and not on any\r\npretence of the quarrel being in any degree her own. She may reasonably\r\nrequire then, that Spain should do everything which depends on her, to\r\nlessen the number of her enemies. She cannot doubt that we shall be of\r\nthat number, if she does not yield our right to the common use of the\r\nMississippi, and the means of using and securing it. You will observe,\r\nwe state in general the necessity, not only of our having a port near the\r\nmouth of the river (without which we could make no use of the navigation\r\nat all) but of its being so well separated from the territories of Spain\r\nand her jurisdiction, as not to engender daily disputes and broils between\r\nus. It is certain, that if Spain were to retain any jurisdiction over our\r\nentrepôt, her officers would abuse that jurisdiction, and our people would\r\nabuse their privileges in it. Both parties must foresee this, and that it\r\nwill end in war. Hence the necessity of a well-defined separation. Nature\r\nhas decided what shall be the geography of that in the end, whatever it\r\nmight be in the beginning, by cutting off from the adjacent countries\r\nof Florida and Louisiana, and enclosing between two of its channels,\r\na long and narrow slip of land, called the Island of New Orleans. The\r\nidea of ceding this, could not be hazarded to Spain, in the first step;\r\nit would be too disagreeable at first view; because this island, with\r\nits town, constitutes, at present, their principal settlement in that\r\npart of their dominions, containing about ten thousand white inhabitants\r\nof every age and sex. Reason and events, however, may, by little and\r\nlittle, familiarize them to it. That we have a right to some spot as an\r\nentrepôt for our commerce, may be at once affirmed. The expediency, too,\r\nmay be expressed, of so locating it as to cut off the source of future\r\nquarrels and wars. A disinterested eye, looking on a map, will remark how\r\nconveniently this tongue of land is formed for the purpose; the Iberville\r\nand Amit channel offering a good boundary and convenient outlet, on the\r\none side, for Florida, and the main channel an equally good boundary and\r\noutlet, on the other side, for Louisiana; while the slip of land between,\r\nis almost entirely morass or sandbank; the whole of it lower than the\r\nwater of the river, in its highest floods, and only its western margin\r\n(which is the highest ground) secured by banks and inhabited. I suppose\r\nthis idea too much even for the Count de Montmorin at first, and that,\r\ntherefore, you will find it prudent to urge, and get him to recommend to\r\nthe Spanish court, only in general terms, \"a port near the mouth of the\r\nriver, with a circumjacent territory sufficient for its support, well\r\ndefined, and extra-territorial to Spain,\" leaving the idea to future\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nI enclose you the copy of a paper distributed by the Spanish commandant on\r\nthe west side of the Mississippi, which may justify us to M. de Montmorin,\r\nfor pushing this matter to an immediate conclusion. It cannot be expected\r\nwe shall give Spain time, to be used by her for dismembering us.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to apprize you of a circumstance, which may show the\r\nexpediency of being in some degree on your guard, even in your\r\ncommunications to the court of France. It is believed here, that the Count\r\nde Moustier, during his residence with us, conceived the project of again\r\nengaging France in a colony upon our continent, and that he directed\r\nhis views to some of the country on the Mississippi, and obtained and\r\ncommunicated a good deal of matter on the subject to his court. He saw\r\nthe immediate advantage of selling some yards of French cloths and silks\r\nto the inhabitants of New Orleans. But he did not take into account what\r\nit would cost France to nurse and protect a colony there, till it should\r\nbe able to join its neighbors, or to stand by itself; and then what it\r\nwould cost her to get rid of it. I hardly suspect that the court of France\r\ncould be seduced by so partial a view of the subject as was presented\r\nto them, and I suspect it the less, since the National Assembly has\r\nconstitutionally excluded conquest from the object of their government.\r\nIt may be added, too, that the place being ours, their yards of cloth and\r\nsilk would be as freely sold as if it were theirs.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive by this letter, and the papers it encloses, what part of\r\nthe ideas of Count d'Estaing correspond with our views. The answer to him\r\nmust be a compound of civility and reserve, expressing our thankfulness\r\nfor his attentions, that we consider them as proofs of the continuance of\r\nhis friendly dispositions, and that though it might be out of our system\r\nto implicate ourselves in trans-Atlantic guarantees, yet other parts\r\nof his plans are capable of being improved to the common benefit of the\r\nparties. Be so good as to say to him something of this kind verbally, and\r\nso as that the matter may be ended as between him and us.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, in the event of war, it is left to the judgment of the\r\nMarquis de La Fayette and yourself, how far you will develop the ideas now\r\ncommunicated to the Count de Montmorin, and how far you will suffer them\r\nto be developed to the Spanish court.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a pamphlet by Hutchins for your further information on the\r\nsubject of the Mississippi; and am, with sentiments of perfect esteem and\r\nattachment, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\n                                                 New York, August 11, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,--The President having thought proper to confide several special\r\nmatters in Europe to your care, it will be expedient that you take your\r\npassage in the first convenient vessel bound to the port of London.\r\n\r\nWhen there, you will be pleased to deliver to Mr. G. Morris and to Mr.\r\nJohnson, the letters and papers you will have in charge for them, to\r\ncommunicate to us from thence any interesting public intelligence you\r\nmay be able to obtain, and then to take as early a passage as possible to\r\nLisbon.\r\n\r\nAt Lisbon, you will deliver the letter with which you are charged for\r\nthe Chevalier Pinto, putting on it the address proper to his present\r\nsituation. You know the contents of this letter, and will make it the\r\nsubject of such conferences with him, as may be necessary to obtain our\r\npoint of establishing there the diplomatic grade which alone coincides\r\nwith our system, and of insuring its reception and treatment with the\r\nrequisite respect. Communicate to us the result of your conferences, and\r\nthen proceed to Madrid.\r\n\r\nThere you will deliver the letters and papers which you have in charge\r\nfor Mr. Carmichael, the contents of all which are known to you. Be so good\r\nas to multiply, as much as possible, your conferences with him, in order\r\nto possess him fully of the special matters sketched out in those papers,\r\nand of the state of our affairs in general.\r\n\r\nYour stay there will be as long as its object may require, only taking\r\ncare to return to Lisbon by the time you may reasonably expect that our\r\nanswers to your letters, to be written from Lisbon, may reach that place.\r\nThis cannot be earlier than the first or second week of January. These\r\nanswers will convey to you the President's further pleasure.\r\n\r\nThrough the whole of this business, it will be best that you avoid all\r\nsuspicion of being on any public business. This need be known only to\r\nthe Chevalier Pinto and Mr. Carmichael. The former need not know of your\r\njourney to Madrid, or if it be necessary, he may be made to understand\r\nthat it is a journey of curiosity, to fill up the interval between writing\r\nyour letters and receiving the answers. To every other person, it will be\r\nbest that you appear as a private traveller.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States allows you from this date, at the rate\r\nof two thousand two hundred and fifty dollars a year, for your services\r\nand expenses, and moreover, what you may incur for the postage of letters;\r\nuntil he shall otherwise order.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\n                                                 New York, August 12, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Your letter of May the 29th to the President of the United\r\nStates, has been duly received. You have placed their proposition of\r\nexchanging a minister on proper ground. It must certainly come from them,\r\nand come in unequivocal form. With those who respect their own dignity so\r\nmuch, ours must not be counted at naught. On their own proposal formally,\r\nto exchange a minister, we sent them one. They have taken no notice of\r\nthat, and talk of agreeing to exchange one now, as if the idea were new.\r\nBesides, what they are saying to you, they are talking to us through\r\nQuebec; but so informally, that they may disavow it when they please. It\r\nwould only oblige them to make the fortune of the poor Major, whom they\r\nwould pretend to sacrifice. Through him, they talk of a minister, a treaty\r\nof commerce _and alliance_. If the object of the latter be honorable, it\r\nis useless; if dishonorable, inadmissible. These tamperings prove, they\r\nview a war as very possible; and some symptoms indicate designs against\r\nthe Spanish possessions adjoining us. The consequences of their acquiring\r\nall the country on our frontier, from the St. Croix to the St. Mary's, are\r\ntoo obvious to you to need development. You will readily see the dangers\r\nwhich would then environ us. We wish you, therefore, to intimate to them\r\nthat we cannot be indifferent to enterprises of this kind. That we should\r\ncontemplate a change of neighbors with extreme uneasiness; and that a\r\ndue balance on our borders is not less desirable to us, than a balance of\r\npower in Europe has always appeared to them. We wish to be neutral, and\r\nwe will be so, _if they will execute the treaty fairly_, and _attempt no\r\nconquests adjoining us_. The first condition is just; the second imposes\r\nno hardship on them. They cannot complain that the other dominions of\r\nSpain would be so narrow as not to leave them room enough for conquest.\r\nIf the war takes place, we would really wish to be quieted on these two\r\npoints, offering in return an honorable neutrality. More than this, they\r\nare not to expect. It will be proper that these ideas be conveyed in\r\ndelicate and friendly terms; but that they be conveyed, if the war takes\r\nplace; for it is in that case alone, and not till it be begun, that we\r\nshould wish our dispositions to be known. But in no case, need they think\r\nof our accepting any equivalent for the posts.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem, dear Sir your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE ATTORNIES OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SEVERAL DISTRICTS, THOSE OF\r\nMAINE AND KENTUCKY EXCEPTED.\r\n\r\n                                                 New York, August 12, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,--It is desirable that government should be informed what proceedings\r\nhave taken place in the several States since the treaty with Great\r\nBritain, which may be considered by that nation as infractions of the\r\ntreaty, and consequently that we should be furnished with copies of\r\nall acts, orders, proclamations, and decisions, legislative, executive,\r\nor judiciary, which may have affected the debts or other property, or\r\nthe persons, of British subjects or American refugees. The proceedings\r\nsubsequent to the treaty, will sometimes call for those also which took\r\nplace during the war. No person is more able than yourself, Sir, to\r\nfurnish us with a list of the proceedings of this kind which have taken\r\nplace within your State, nor is there any one on whom we may with more\r\npropriety rely for it, as well as to take the trouble of furnishing us\r\nwith exact copies of them. Should you be so kind as to state any facts or\r\ncircumstances which may enter into the justification or explanation of any\r\nof these proceedings, they will be thankfully received; and it is wished\r\nthe whole may come to hand between this and the last of October.\r\n\r\nWhile I am troubling you with this commission, I am obliged to add a\r\nsecond, which being undertaken at this time, will abridge the labor of the\r\nfirst. It is found indispensable that we be possessed here of a complete\r\ncollection of all the printed laws and ordinances, ancient and modern, of\r\nevery State of the Union. I must ask the favor of you, Sir, to have such\r\na collection made for us, so far as relates to your State. The volumes\r\nof this collection which, being more modern, may be more readily found, I\r\nwill ask the favor of you to send immediately by whatever conveyance you\r\nthink safest and best; those more rarely to be had, you will be so good as\r\nto forward from time to time, as you can get them. For your reimbursement,\r\nbe pleased to draw on me, only expressing in your draught that it is for\r\n\"the laws of your State, purchased and forwarded for the United States:\"\r\nor, if it should be more convenient to you, I will at any time send you\r\nan order from the treasury for your reimbursement on the collection most\r\nconvenient to you. This shall be as you please.\r\n\r\nYour zeal for the general service needs not to be excited by information,\r\nthat it is with the special approbation of the President of the United\r\nStates that I address you on this occasion.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great regard, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n                                                 New York, August 14, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I am setting out on a trip to Rhode Island with the President\r\nto-morrow, by water. We shall be absent five or six days, and of course\r\nhis departure hence to the southward will be that much later than he\r\nintended; and my departure, which must be after his, a little delayed.\r\nStill I hope to reach Monticello by the 15th of September, or from that\r\nto the 20th. We have just concluded a treaty with the Creeks, which is\r\nimportant, as drawing a line between them and Georgia, and enabling the\r\ngovernment to do, as it will do, justice against either party offending.\r\nCongress separated the day before yesterday, having in the latter part\r\nof their session re-acquired the harmony which had always distinguished\r\ntheir proceedings, till the two disagreeable subjects of the assumption\r\nand residence were introduced. These really threatened, at one time,\r\na separation of the legislature _sine die_. They saw the necessity of\r\nsuspending almost all business for some time; and, when they resumed it,\r\nof some mutual sacrifices of opinion. It is not foreseen that anything\r\nso generative of dissension can arise again, and therefore the friends\r\nof the government hope that, this difficulty once surmounted in the\r\nStates, everything will work well. I am principally afraid that commerce\r\nwill be overloaded by the assumption, believing that it would be better\r\nthat property should be duly taxed. Present me affectionately to my dear\r\ndaughters, and believe me to be sincerely yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR HANCOCK.\r\n\r\n                                                 New York, August 24, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,--The representatives of the United States have been pleased to refer\r\nto me the representation from the general court of Massachusetts, on the\r\nsubject of the whale and cod fisheries, which had been transmitted by\r\nyour Excellency, with an instruction to examine the matter thereof, and\r\nreport my opinion thereupon to the next session of Congress. To prepare\r\nsuch a report as may convey to them the information necessary to lead\r\nto an adequate remedy, it is indispensable that I obtain a statement of\r\nthe fisheries, comprehending such a period before and since the war, as\r\nmay show the extent to which they were and are carried on. With such\r\na statement under their view, Congress may be able, by comparing the\r\ncircumstances which existed when the fisheries flourished, with those\r\nwhich exist at this moment of their decline, to discover the cause of\r\nthat decline, and provide either a remedy for it, or something which may\r\ncountervail its effect. This information can be obtained nowhere but in\r\nthe State over which your Excellency presides, and under no other auspices\r\nso likely to produce it. May I, therefore, take the liberty of soliciting\r\nyour Excellency to charge with the collecting and furnishing me this\r\ninformation, some person or persons who may be competent to the object.\r\nTaking a point of commencement at a proper interval before the year of\r\ngreatest prosperity, there should be stated in a table, year by year,\r\nunder different columns, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The number of vessels fitted out each year for the codfishery. 2.\r\nTheir tonnage. 3. The number of seamen employed. 4. The quantity of fish\r\ntaken; 1, of superior quality; 2, of inferior. 5. The quantity of each\r\nkind exported; 1, to Europe, and to what countries there; 2, to other, and\r\nwhat parts of America. 6. The average prices at the markets, 1, of Europe;\r\n2, of America. With respect to the whale fishery, after the three first\r\narticles, the following should be substituted. 4. Whether to the northern\r\nor southern fishery. 5. The quantity of oil taken; 1, of the spermaceti\r\nwhale; 2, of the other kinds. 6. To what market each kind was sent. 7.\r\nThe average prices of each. As the ports from which the equipments were\r\nmade, could not be stated in the same table conveniently, they might\r\nform a separate one. It would be very material that I should receive this\r\ninformation by the first of November, as I might be able to bestow a more\r\nundisturbed attention to the subject before than after the meeting of\r\nCongress, and it would be better to present it to them at the beginning,\r\nthan towards the close of a session.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar degree of interest with which this subject must affect\r\nthe State of Massachusetts, the impossibility of obtaining necessary\r\ninformation from any other quarter, and the slender means I should have\r\nof acquiring it from thence, without the aid of your Excellency, will,\r\nI hope, be a sufficient apology for the trouble I take the liberty of\r\ngiving you; and I am happy in every occasion of repeating assurances\r\nof the respect and attachment with which I have the honor to be, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Circular of the Consuls and Vice-Consuls of the United States._\r\n                                                 New York, August 26, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,--I expected ere this, to have been able to send you an act of\r\nCongress, prescribing some special duties and regulations for the exercise\r\nof the consular offices of the United States; but Congress not having been\r\nable to mature the act sufficiently, it lies over to their next session.\r\nIn the meanwhile, I beg leave to draw your attention to some matters of\r\ninformation, which it is interesting to receive.\r\n\r\nI must beg the favor of you to communicate to me every six months, a\r\nreport of the vessels of the United States which enter at the ports of\r\nyour district, specifying the name and burthen of each vessel, of what\r\ndescription she is, (to wit, ship, snow, brig, &c.,) the names of the\r\nmaster and owners, and number of seamen, the port of the United States\r\nfrom which she cleared, places touched at, her cargo outward and inward,\r\nand the owners thereof, the port to which she is bound, and times of\r\narrival and departure; the whole arranged in a table under different\r\ncolumns, and the reports closing on the last days of June and December.\r\n\r\nWe wish you to use your endeavors that no vessel enter as an American in\r\nthe ports of your district, which shall not be truly such, and that none\r\nbe sold under that name, which are not really of the United States.\r\n\r\nThat you give to me, from time to time, information of all military\r\npreparations, and other indications of war which may take place in your\r\nports; and when a war shall appear imminent, that you notify thereof the\r\nmerchants and vessels of the United States within your district, that they\r\nmay be duly on their guard; and in general, that you communicate to me\r\nsuch political and commercial intelligence, as you may think interesting\r\nto the United States.\r\n\r\nThe consuls and vice-consuls of the United States are free to wear the\r\nuniform of their navy, if they choose to do so. This is a deep blue coat\r\nwith red facings, lining and cuffs, the cuffs slashed and a standing\r\ncollar; a red waistcoat (laced or not at the election of the wearer) and\r\nblue breeches; yellow buttons with a foul anchor, and black cockades and\r\nsmall swords.\r\n\r\nBe pleased to observe, that the vice-consul of one district is not at all\r\nsubordinate to the consul of another. They are equally independent of each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe ground of distinction between these two officers is this. Our\r\ngovernment thinks, that to whatever there may be either of honor or profit\r\nresulting from the consular office, native citizens are first entitled,\r\nwhere such, of proper character, will undertake the duties; but where\r\nnone such offer, a vice-consul is appointed of any other nation. Should\r\na proper native come forward at any future time, he will be named consul;\r\nbut this nomination will not revoke the commission of vice-consul; it will\r\nonly suspend his functions during the continuance of the consul within\r\nthe limits of his jurisdiction, and on his departure therefrom, it is\r\nmeant that the vice-consular authority shall revive of course, without\r\nthe necessity of a re-appointment.\r\n\r\nIt is understood, that consuls and vice-consuls have authority of course,\r\nto appoint their own agents in the several ports of their district, and\r\nthat it is with themselves alone those agents are to correspond.\r\n\r\nIt will be best not fatigue the government in which you reside, or\r\nthose in authority under it, with applications in unimportant cases.\r\nHusband their good dispositions for occasions of some moment, and let all\r\nrepresentations to them be couched in the most temperate and friendly\r\nterms, never indulging in any case whatever, a single expression which\r\nmay irritate.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                                 New York, August 26, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--My last letters to you have been of the 26th of July, and 10th\r\ninstant. Yours of May the 16th, No. 31, has come to hand.\r\n\r\nI enclose you sundry papers, by which you will perceive, that the\r\nexpression in the eleventh article of our treaty of amity and commerce\r\nwith France, viz. \"that the subjects of the United States shall not be\r\nreputed Aubaines _in France_, and consequently shall be exempted from\r\nthe Droit d'Aubaine, or other similar duty, under what name soever,\" has\r\nbeen construed so rigorously to the letter, as to consider us as Aubaines\r\nin the _colonies_ of France. Our intercourse with those colonies is so\r\ngreat, that frequent and important losses will accrue to individuals, if\r\nthis construction be continued. The death of the master or supercargo\r\nof a vessel, rendered a more common event by the unhealthiness of the\r\nclimate, throws all the property which was either his, or under his\r\ncare, into contest. I presume that the enlightened Assembly now engaged\r\nin reforming the remains of feudal abuse among them, will not leave so\r\ninhospitable an one as the Droit d'Aubaine existing in France, or any of\r\nits dominions. If this may be hoped, it will be better that you should\r\nnot trouble the minister with any application for its abolition in the\r\ncolonies as to us. This would be erecting into a special favor to us,\r\nthe extinction of a general abuse, which will, I presume, extinguish of\r\nitself. Only be so good as to see, that in abolishing this odious law\r\nin France, its abolition in the colonies also, be not omitted by mere\r\noversight; but if, contrary to expectations, this fragment of barbarism\r\nbe suffered to remain, then it will become necessary that you bring\r\nforward the enclosed case, and press a liberal and just exposition of our\r\ntreaty, so as to relieve our citizens from this species of risk and ruin\r\nhereafter. Supposing the matter to rest on the eleventh article only, it\r\nis inconceivable, that he, who with respect to his personal goods is as a\r\nnative citizen in the mother country, should be deemed a foreigner in its\r\ncolonies. Accordingly, you will perceive by the opinions of Dr. Franklin\r\nand Dr. Lee, two of our ministers who negotiated and signed the treaty,\r\nthat they considered that rights stipulated for us _in France_, were meant\r\nto exist in all the _dominions of France_.\r\n\r\nConsidering this question under the second article of the treaty also,\r\nwe are exempted from the Droit d'Aubaine in all the dominions of France;\r\nfor by that article, no particular favor is to be granted to any other\r\nnation, which shall not immediately become common to the other party. Now,\r\nby the forty-fourth article of the treaty between France and England,\r\nwhich was subsequent to ours, it is stipulated, \"que dans tout ce qui\r\nconcerne--_les successions des biens mobiliers_--les sujets des deux\r\nhautes parties contractantes auront _dans les Etats respectifs_ les memes\r\nprivileges, libertés et droits, que la nation la plus favorisée.\" This\r\ngave to the English the general abolition of the Droit d'Aubaine, enjoyed\r\nby the Hollanders under the first article of their treaty with France, of\r\nJuly the 23d, 1773, which is in these words, \"Les sujets des E. G. des\r\nP. U. des pays-bas ne seront point assujettis au Droit d'Aubaine dans\r\nles Etats de S. M. T. C.\" This favor then, being granted to the English\r\nsubsequent to our treaty, we become entitled to it of course by the\r\narticle in question. I have it not in my power at this moment, to turn to\r\nthe treaty between France and Russia, which was also posterior to ours.\r\nIf by that, the Russians are exempted from the Droit d'Aubaine, \"_dans\r\nles Etats de_ S. M. T. C.\" it is a ground the more for our claiming the\r\nexemption. To these, you will be pleased to add such other considerations\r\nof reason, friendship, hospitality and reciprocity, as will readily occur\r\nto yourself.\r\n\r\nAbout two or three weeks ago, a Mr. Campbell called on me, and introduced\r\nhimself by observing that his situation was an awkward one, that he had\r\ncome from Denmark with an assurance of being employed here in a public\r\ncharacter, that he was actually in service, though un-announced. He\r\nrepeated conversations which had passed between Count Bernstorff and\r\nhim, and asked me when a minister would be appointed to that court, or a\r\ncharacter sent to negotiate a treaty of commerce; he had not the scrip\r\nof a pen to authenticate himself, however informally. I told him our\r\ngovernment had not yet had time to settle a plan of foreign arrangements;\r\nthat with respect to Denmark particularly, I might safely express to\r\nhim those sentiments of friendship which our government entertained for\r\nthat country, and assurances that the King's subjects would always meet\r\nwith favor and protection here; and in general, I said to him those\r\nthings which being true, might be said to anybody. You can perhaps learn\r\nsomething of him from the Baron de Blome. If he be an unauthorized man, it\r\nwould be well it should be known here, as the respect which our citizens\r\nmight entertain, and the credit they might give to any person supposed to\r\nbe honored by the King's appointment, might lead them into embarrassment.\r\n\r\nYou know the situation of the new loan of three millions of florins going\r\non at Amsterdam. About one half of this is destined for an immediate\r\npayment to France; but advantage may be gained by judiciously timing\r\nthe payment. The French colonies will doubtless claim in their new\r\nconstitution, a right to receive the necessaries of life from whomever\r\nwill deliver them cheapest; to wit, grain, flour, live stock, salted fish,\r\nand other salted provisions. It would be well that you should confer with\r\ntheir deputies, guardedly, and urge them to this demand, if they need\r\nurging. The justice of the National Assembly will probably dispose them to\r\ngrant it, and the clamors of the Bordeaux merchants may be silenced by the\r\nclamors and arms of the colonies. It may co-operate with the influence of\r\nthe colonies, if favorable dispositions towards us can be excited in the\r\nmoment of discussing this point. It will therefore be left to you to say\r\nwhen the payment shall be made, in confidence that you will so time it,\r\nas to forward this great object; and when you make this payment, you may\r\nincrease its effect, by adding assurances to the minister, that measures\r\nhave been taken which will enable us to pay up, within a very short time,\r\nall arrears of principal and interest now due; and further, that Congress\r\nhas fully authorized our government to go on and pay even the balance not\r\nyet due, which we mean to do, if that money can be borrowed on reasonable\r\nterms; and that favorable arrangements of commerce between us and their\r\ncolonies, might dispose us to effect that payment with less regard to\r\nterms. You will, of course, find excuses for not paying the money which is\r\nready and put under your orders, till you see that the moment has arrived\r\nwhen the emotions it may excite, may give a decisive cast to the demands\r\nof the colonies.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers, as usual, will accompany the present.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem and attachment, dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\n                                                 New York, August 26, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--On the hasty view which the shortness of time permits me to\r\ntake of the treaty of Hopewell, the act of cession of North Carolina and\r\nthe act of acceptance by Congress, I hazard the following sentiments:\r\n\r\nWere the treaty of Hopewell, and the act of acceptance of Congress to\r\nstand in any point in direct opposition to each other, I should consider\r\nthe act of acceptance as void in that point; because the treaty is a law\r\nmade by two parties, and not revocable by one of them either acting alone\r\nor in conjunction with a third party. If we consider the acceptance as\r\na legislative act of Congress, it is the act of one party only; if we\r\nconsider it as a treaty between Congress and North Carolina, it is but\r\na subsequent treaty with another power, and cannot make void a preceding\r\none with a different power.\r\n\r\nBut I see no such opposition between these two instruments. The Cherokees\r\nwere entitled to the sole occupation of the lands within the limits\r\nguaranteed to them. The State of North Carolina, according to the _jus\r\ngentium_ established for America by universal usage, had only a right of\r\npre-emption of these lands against all other nations. It could convey,\r\nthen, to its citizens only this right of pre-emption, and the right of\r\noccupation could not be united to it till obtained by the United States\r\nfrom the Cherokees. The act of cession of North Carolina only preserves\r\nthe rights of its citizens in the same state as they would have been, _had\r\nthat act never been passed_. It does not make imperfect titles perfect;\r\nbut only prevents their being made worse. Congress, by their act, accept\r\non these conditions. The claimants of North Carolina, then, and also the\r\nCherokees, are exactly where they would have been, had neither the act\r\nof cession, nor that of acceptance, been ever made; that is, the latter\r\npossess the right of occupation, and the former the right of pre-emption.\r\n\r\nThough these deductions seem clear enough, yet the question would be a\r\ndisagreeable one between the general government, a particular government,\r\nand individuals, and it would seem very desirable to draw all the claims\r\nof pre-emption within a certain limit, by commuting for those out of it,\r\nand then to purchase of the Cherokees the right of occupation.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, my dear Sir, yours respectfully and affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. LA FOREST, _Consul of France_.\r\n\r\n                                                 New York, August 30, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,--I asked the favor of the Secretary of the Treasury to consider the\r\nfourth article of the consular convention, and to let me know whether\r\nhe should conclude that consuls not exercising commerce, were exempt\r\nfrom paying duties on things imported for their own use. I furnished\r\nhim no explanation whatever, of what had passed on the subject at the\r\ntime of forming the convention, because I thought it should be decided\r\non the words of the convention, as they are offered to all the world,\r\nand that it would only be where these are equivocal, that explanations\r\nmight be adduced from other circumstances. He considered the naked words\r\nof the article, and delivered me as his opinion, that, according to\r\nthese, the first paragraph, \"The consuls, and vice-consuls, &c., as the\r\nnatives are,\" subjected all their property, in whatever form and under\r\nwhatever circumstances it existed, to the same duties and taxes to which\r\nthe property of other individuals is liable, and exempts them only from\r\n_taxes on their persons_, as poll taxes, head rates for the poor, for town\r\ncharges, &c.; and that the second paragraph, \"Those of the said consuls,\r\n&c., or other merchants,\" subjected such of them as exercised commerce,\r\neven to the same _personal taxes_ as other merchants are: that the second\r\nparagraph is an abridgment of the first, not an enlargement of it; and\r\nthat the exemption of those, not merchants, which seemed _implied_ in the\r\nwords of the second paragraph, could not be admitted against the contrary\r\nmeaning, directly and unequivocally expressed in the first.\r\n\r\nSuch, Sir, was his opinion, and it is exactly conformable to what the\r\nnegotiators had in view in forming this article. I have turned to the\r\npapers which passed on that occasion, and I find that the first paragraph\r\nwas proposed in the first project given in by myself, by which the\r\ndistinction between taxes on their property and taxes on their persons,\r\nis clearly enounced, and was agreed to; but as our merchants exercising\r\ncommerce in France, would have enjoyed a much greater benefit from the\r\npersonal exemption, than those of France do here, M. de Reyneval, in his\r\nfirst counter-project, inserted the second paragraph, to which I agreed.\r\nSo that the object was, in the first paragraph, to put consuls, not being\r\nmerchants, on the same footing with citizens, not being merchants; and in\r\nthe second, to put consuls, merchants, on the same footing with citizens,\r\nmerchants.\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, we suppose to be the sense of the convention, which has become\r\na part of the law of the land, and the law, you know, in this country, is\r\nnot under the control of the executive, either in its meaning or course.\r\nWe must reserve, therefore, for more favorable occasions, our dispositions\r\nto render the situation of the consuls of his Majesty as easy as possible,\r\nby indulgences depending more on us; and of proving the sentiments of\r\nesteem and attachment to yourself personally, with which I have the honor\r\nto be, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BONDFIELD.\r\n\r\n                                                 New York, August 31, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--You will have understood perhaps that in the appointment of\r\nconsuls, which has taken place, another than yourself has been named for\r\nBordeaux. I feel it a duty to explain this matter to you, lest it should\r\ngive you an uneasiness as to the cause. No nomination occasioned more\r\ndifficulty, nor hung longer suspended. But the senate refused in every\r\ninstance, where there was a _native citizen_ in any port, to consent to\r\nthe nomination of any other. While this explains the reason of your not\r\nhaving been appointed, I trust it will also excuse those with whom the\r\nappointment rested. With respect to myself particularly, I beg you to be\r\nassured that I shall be happy in every occasion of being useful to you,\r\nand of proving to you the sentiments of esteem and attachment with which\r\nI have the honor to be, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. VIAR.\r\n\r\n                                              Monticello, October 27, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,--I am honored here by the receipt of your favor of the 7th instant,\r\ncovering a letter to me from the governor of East Florida, wherein he\r\ninforms me that he has received the King's orders, not to permit, under\r\nany pretext, that persons held in slavery in the United States introduce\r\nthemselves as free, into the province of East Florida. I am happy that\r\nthis grievance, which had been a subject of great complaint from the\r\ncitizens of Georgia, is to be removed, and that we have therein a proof\r\nas well of the general principles of justice which form the basis of his\r\nMajesty's character and administration, as of his disposition to meet us\r\nin the cultivation of that mutual friendship and union of interests which\r\nwould be the happiness of both countries, and is the sincere wish of ours.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect respect and\r\nesteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                              Monticello, October 27, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,--I had intended to set out about this time for Philadelphia, but\r\nthe desire of having Mr. Madison's company, who cannot return for some\r\ndays yet, and believing that nothing important requires my presence at\r\nPhiladelphia as yet, induce me to postpone my departure to the 8th of\r\nthe ensuing month, so that it will be about the 12th before I can have\r\nthe honor of waiting on you at Mount Vernon, to take your commands. In\r\nthe meantime, the papers enclosed will communicate to you everything\r\nwhich has occurred to me since I saw you, and worthy notice. Our affair\r\nwith Algiers seems to call for some new decision; and something will be\r\nto be done with the new Emperor of Morocco. Mr. Madison and myself have\r\nendeavored to press on some members of the assembly the expediency of\r\ntheir undertaking to build two good private dwelling houses a year, for\r\nten years in the new city, to be rented or sold for the benefit of the\r\nState. Should they do this, and Maryland as much, it will be one means of\r\nensuring the removal of government thither. Candidates for the Senate are\r\nsaid to be the Speaker, Colonel Harrison, Colonel H. Lee, and Mr. Walker;\r\nbut it is the opinion of many that Colonel Monroe will be impressed into\r\nthe service. He has agreed, it seems, with a good deal of reluctance, to\r\nsay he will serve if chosen. I have the honor to be, with sentiments of\r\nthe most perfect respect and attachment, Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FREDERICK KINLOCH, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, November 26, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Your favor of April 26th, 1789, did not come to my hands\r\ntill the 4th of the last month, when it found me on my way to Virginia.\r\nIt should not otherwise have been so long unanswered. I am certainly\r\nflattered by the approbation you are so good as to express of the Notes\r\non Virginia. The passage relative to the English, which has excited\r\ndisagreeable sensations in your mind, is accounted for by observing that\r\nit was written during the war, while they were committing depredations\r\nin my own country and on my own property never practised by a civilized\r\nnation. Perhaps their conduct and dispositions since the war have not\r\nbeen as well calculated as they might have been to excite more favorable\r\ndispositions on our part. Still, as a political man, they shall never find\r\nany passion in me either for or against them. Whenever their avarice of\r\ncommerce will let them meet us fairly half way, I should meet them with\r\nsatisfaction, because it would be for our benefit; but I mistake their\r\ncharacter if they do this under present circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe rumors of war seem to pass away. Such an event might have produced to\r\nus some advantages; but it might also have exposed us to dangers; and on\r\nthe whole I think a general peace more desirable. Be so good as to present\r\nmy respects to Mrs. Kinloch, and to be assured of the esteem and respect\r\nwith which I am, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, November 26, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I have yet to acknowledge the receipt of your two favors of\r\nApril 10 and July 7. By the latter it would seem as if you had written\r\nan intermediate one, which has never come to hand; and the letter\r\nof July 7 itself, was not received till the 14th of October, while\r\nI was in Virginia, from which I am but just returned. The President\r\nis not yet returned, though expected to-morrow. The Declaration and\r\nCounter-Declaration established with us a full expectation that peace\r\nwould be continued; perhaps this is still the most rational opinion,\r\nthough the _English_ papers continue to talk of preparations for war. That\r\nsuch an event would have ensured good prices for our produce, and so far\r\nhave been advantageous, is probable; but it would have exposed us to risks\r\nalso, which are better deferred, for some years at least. It is not to be\r\nexpected that our system of finance has met your approbation in all its\r\nparts. It has excited even here great opposition; and more especially that\r\npart of it which transferred the State debts to the general government.\r\nThe States of Virginia and North Carolina are peculiarly dissatisfied\r\nwith this measure. I believe, however, that it is harped on by many to\r\nmask their disaffection to the government on other grounds. Its great foe\r\nin Virginia is an implacable one. He avows it himself, but does not avow\r\nall his motives for it. The measures and tone of the government threaten\r\nabortion to some of his speculations; most particularly to that of the\r\nYazoo territory. But it is too well nerved to be overawed by individual\r\nopposition. It is proposed to provide additional funds, to meet the\r\nadditional debt, by a tax on spirituous liquors, foreign and home-made,\r\nso that the whole interest will be paid by taxes on consumption. If a\r\nsufficiency can now be raised in this way to pay the interest at present,\r\nits increase by the increase of population (suppose five per cent. per\r\nannum), will alone sink the principle within a few years, operating, as\r\nit will, in the way of compound interest. Add to this what may be done\r\nby throwing in the aid of western lands and other articles as a sinking\r\nfund, and our prospect is really a bright one.\r\n\r\nA pretty important expedition has been undertaken against the Indians\r\nnorth of the Ohio. As yet we have no news of its success. The late\r\nelections of members of Congress have changed about a third or fourth of\r\nthem. It is imagined the session of Congress, which is to begin within ten\r\ndays, will end on the 3d of March, with the federal year; as a continuance\r\nover that day would oblige them to call forward the new members. The\r\nadmission of Vermont and Kentucky into Congress, will be decided on in\r\nthis session. I have the honor to be, with very great esteem, dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COUNT DE MOUSTIER.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, December 3, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I am afraid I have suffered in your opinion from the delay\r\nof acknowledging the receipt of your several letters, into which I have\r\nbeen led by unavoidable circumstances. The truth is that since my arrival\r\nin America (now exactly a twelve-month), I have been able to pass not\r\none-third of that time at the seat of government, one half of which was\r\nlost by an illness, during which I was incapable of doing anything, and\r\nthe residue so engaged by accumulated business as to oblige me to suspend\r\nmy private correspondences. I beg you to be assured that yours is valued\r\nby me too much to have been suspended under any other circumstances. I\r\nam just now returned from Virginia to this place, where the members of\r\ngovernment are now assembling to begin its administration here, and I\r\navail myself of the first moments to recall myself to your recollection.\r\nFortune seems to have arranged among her destinies that I should never\r\ncontinue for any time with a person whose manners and principles had\r\nexcited my warm attachment. While I resided in France, you resided in\r\nAmerica. While I was crossing over to America, you were crossing back\r\nto France; when I am come to reside with our government, your residence\r\nis transferred to Berlin. Of all this, Fortune is the mistress; but\r\nshe cannot change my affections, nor lessen the regrets I feel at their\r\nperpetual disappointment. I am sincerely sorry at the delays which the\r\nsettlement of your constitution has experienced. I suppose they have\r\nbeen rendered unavoidable by difficulties, and hope all will end well.\r\nThey have certainly prolonged the risk to which the new work was exposed\r\nfrom without as well as within. I think it would be better to wind it\r\nup as quickly as possible, to consider it as a mere experiment to be\r\namended hereafter, when time and trial shall show where it is imperfect.\r\nOur second experiment is going on happily; and so far we have no reason\r\nto wish for changes, except by adding those principles which several\r\nof the States thought were necessary as a further security for their\r\nliberties. All of these, as proposed by Congress, will certainly be\r\nadopted, except the second, which is doubtful, and the first, which is\r\nrejected. The powers of the government for the collection of taxes, are\r\nfound to be perfect, so far as they have been tried. This has been as\r\nyet only by duties on consumption. As these fall principally on the rich,\r\nit is a general desire to make them contribute the whole money we want,\r\nif possible. And we have a hope that they will furnish enough for the\r\nexpenses of government and the interest of our whole public debt, foreign\r\nand domestic. If they do this for the present, their increase, from the\r\nincrease of population and consumption, (which is at the rate of five per\r\ncentum per annum,) will sink the capital in thirteen or fourteen years,\r\nas it will operate in the way of compound interest. Independent of this\r\nprospect, which is itself a good one, we make the produce of our land\r\noffice, and some other articles, a sinking fund for the principal. We are\r\nnow going on with a census of our inhabitants. It will not be completed\r\ntill the next summer; but such progress is already made as to show our\r\nnumbers will very considerably exceed the former estimates. I shall be\r\nhappy to hear of your health and welfare everywhere, and that you will\r\ncontinue persuaded of the sentiments of respect and esteem with which\r\nI have the honor to be dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. NOAH WEBSTER, AT HARTFORD.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, December 4, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,--Your favor of October 4 came to my hands on the 20th of November.\r\nApplication was made a day or two after to Mr. Dobson for the copies of\r\nyour Essays, which were received, and one of them lodged in the office.\r\nFor that intended for myself, be pleased to accept my thanks. I return you\r\nthe order on Mr. Allen, that on Dobson having been made use of instead of\r\nit. I submit to your consideration whether it might not be advisable to\r\nrecord a second time your right to the Grammatical Institutes, in order to\r\nbring the lodging of the copy in my office within the six months, made a\r\ncondition in the law? I have not at this moment an opportunity of turning\r\nto the law to see if that may be done; but I suppose it possible that the\r\nfailure to fulfil the legal condition on the first record might excite\r\nobjections against the validity of that.\r\n\r\nIn mentioning me in your Essays, and canvassing my opinions, you have\r\ndone what every man has a right to do, and it is for the good of society\r\nthat that right should be freely exercised. No republic has more zeal\r\nthan that of letters, and I am the last in principles, as I am the least\r\nin pretensions, to any dictatorship in it. Had I other dispositions, the\r\nphilosophical and dispassionate spirit with which you have expressed\r\nyour own opinions in opposition to mine, would still have commanded\r\nmy approbation. A desire of being set right in your opinion, which I\r\nrespect too much not to entertain that desire, induces me to hazard to\r\nyou the following observations. It had become an universal and almost\r\nuncontroverted position in the several States, that the purposes of\r\nsociety do not require a surrender of all our rights to our ordinary\r\ngovernors; that there are certain portions of right not necessary to\r\nenable them to carry on an effective government, and which experience has\r\nnevertheless proved they will be constantly encroaching on, if submitted\r\nto them; that there are also certain fences which experience has proved\r\npeculiarly efficacious against wrong, and rarely obstructive of right,\r\nwhich yet the governing powers have ever shown a disposition to weaken\r\nand remove. Of the first kind, for instance, is freedom of religion; of\r\nthe second, trial by jury, habeas corpus laws, free presses. These were\r\nthe settled opinions of all the States,--of that of Virginia, of which I\r\nwas writing, as well as of the others. The others had, in consequence,\r\ndelineated these unceded portions of right, and these fences against\r\nwrong, which they meant to exempt from the power of their governors,\r\nin instruments called declarations of rights and constitutions; and\r\nas they did this by conventions, which they appointed for the express\r\npurpose of reserving these rights, and of delegating others to their\r\nordinary legislative, executive and judiciary bodies, none of the\r\nreserved rights can be touched without resorting to the people to appoint\r\nanother convention for the express purpose of permitting it. Where the\r\nconstitutions then have been so formed by conventions named for this\r\nexpress purpose, they are fixed and unalterable but by a convention or\r\nother body to be specially authorized; and they have been so formed by, I\r\nbelieve, all the States, except Virginia. That State concurs in all these\r\nopinions, but has run into the wonderful error that her constitution,\r\nthough made by the ordinary legislature, cannot yet be altered by the\r\nordinary legislature. I had, therefore, no occasion to prove to them\r\nthe expediency of a constitution alterable only by a special convention.\r\nAccordingly, I have not in my notes advocated that opinion, though it was\r\nand is mine, as it was and is theirs. I take that position as admitted\r\nby them, and only proceed to adduce arguments to prove that they were\r\nmistaken in supposing their constitution could not be altered by the\r\ncommon legislature. Among other arguments I urge that the convention which\r\nformed the constitution had been chosen merely for ordinary legislation;\r\nthat they had no higher power than every subsequent legislature was\r\nto have; that all their acts are consequently repealable by subsequent\r\nlegislatures; that their own practice at a subsequent session proved they\r\nwere of this opinion themselves; that the opinion and practice of several\r\nsubsequent legislatures had been the same, and so conclude \"that their\r\nconstitution is alterable by the common legislature.\" Yet these arguments\r\nurged to prove that their constitution _is_ alterable, you cite as if\r\nurged to prove that it _ought not to be_ alterable, and you combat them\r\non that ground. An argument which is good to prove one thing, may become\r\nridiculous when exhibited as intended to prove another thing. I will\r\nbeg the favor of you to look over again the passage in my notes, and am\r\npersuaded you will be sensible that you have misapprehended the object of\r\nmy arguments, and therefore have combated them on a ground for which they\r\nwere not intended. My only object in this is the rectification of your own\r\nopinion of me, which I repeat that I respect too much to neglect. I have\r\ncertainly no view of entering into the contest, whether it be expedient\r\nto delegate unlimited powers to our ordinary governors? my opinion is\r\nagainst that expediency; but my occupations do not permit me to undertake\r\nto vindicate all my opinions, nor have they importance enough to merit it.\r\nIt cannot, however, but weaken my confidence in them, when I find them\r\nopposed to yours, there being no one who respects the latter more than,\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, December 17, 1790.\r\n\r\nSince mine to you of August the 12th, yours of July the 3d, August the\r\n16th, and September the 18th, have come to hand. They suffice to remove\r\nall doubts which might have been entertained as to the real intentions of\r\nthe British cabinet, on the several matters confided to you. The view of\r\ngovernment in troubling you with this business was, either to remove from\r\nbetween the two nations all causes of difference, by a fair and friendly\r\nadjustment, if such was the intention of the other party, or to place it\r\nbeyond a doubt that such was not their intention. In result, it is clear\r\nenough that further applications would tend to delay, rather than advance\r\nour object. It is therefore the pleasure of the President, that no orders\r\nbe made; and that in whatever state this letter may find the business, in\r\nthat state it be left. I have it in charge, at the same time, to assure\r\nyou that your conduct in these communications with the British ministers,\r\nhas met the President's entire approbation, and to convey to you his\r\nacknowledgments for your services.\r\n\r\nAs an attendance on this business must, at times, have interfered with\r\nyour private pursuits, and subjected you also to additional expenses, I\r\nhave the honor to enclose you a draft on our bankers in Holland, for a\r\nthousand dollars, as an indemnification for those sacrifices.\r\n\r\nMy letter of August the 12th, desired a certain other communication to be\r\nmade to the same court, if a war should have actually commenced. If the\r\nevent has not already called for it, it is considered as inexpedient to\r\nbe made at all.\r\n\r\nYou will of course have the goodness to inform us of whatever may have\r\npassed further, since the date of your last.\r\n\r\nIn conveying to you this testimony of approbation from the President of\r\nthe United States, I am happy in an occasion of repeating assurances of\r\nthe sentiments of perfect esteem and respect with which I have the honor\r\nto be, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, December 17, 1790.\r\n\r\nSir,--Though not yet informed of the receipt of my letter, covering your\r\ncommission as consul for the United States, in the port of London, yet\r\nknowing that the ship has arrived by which it went, I take for granted\r\nthe letter and commission have gone safe to hand, and that you have been\r\ncalled into the frequent exercise of your office for the relief of our\r\nseamen, upon whom such multiplied acts of violence have been committed in\r\nEngland, by press-gangs, pretending to take them for British subjects, not\r\nonly without evidence, but against evidence. By what means may be procured\r\nfor our seamen, while in British ports, that security for their persons\r\nwhich the laws of hospitality require, and which the British nation will\r\nsurely not refuse, remains to be settled. In the meantime, there is one\r\nof these cases, wherein so wilful and so flagrant a violation has been\r\ncommitted by a British officer, on the person of one of our citizens,\r\nas requires that it be laid before his government, in friendly and firm\r\nreliance of satisfaction for the injury, and of assurance for the future,\r\nthat the citizens of the United States, entering the ports of Great\r\nBritain, in pursuit of a lawful commerce, shall be protected by the laws\r\nof hospitality in usage among nations.\r\n\r\nIt is represented to the President of the United States, that Hugh Purdie,\r\na native of Williamsburg, in Virginia, was, in the month of July last,\r\nseized in London by a party of men, calling themselves press-officers,\r\nand pretending authority from their government so to do, notwithstanding\r\nhis declarations and the evidence he offered of his being a native citizen\r\nof the United States; and that he was transferred on board the Crescent,\r\na British ship of war, commanded by a Captain Young. Passing over the\r\nintermediate violences exercised on him, because not peculiar to his case\r\n(so many other American citizens having suffered the same), I proceed\r\nto the particular one which distinguishes the present representation.\r\nSatisfactory evidence having been produced by Mr. John Brown Cutting, a\r\ncitizen of the United States, to the Lords of the Admiralty, that Hugh\r\nPurdie was a native citizen of the same States, they, in their justice,\r\nissued orders to the Lord Howe, their Admiral, for his discharge. In the\r\nmeantime, the Lord Howe had sailed with the fleet of which the Crescent\r\nwas. But, on the 27th of August, he wrote to the board of admiralty, that\r\nhe had received their orders for the discharge of Hugh Purdie, and had\r\ndirected it accordingly. Notwithstanding these orders, the receipt of\r\nwhich at sea Captain Young acknowledges, notwithstanding Captain Young's\r\nconfessed knowledge, that Hugh Purdie was a citizen of the United States,\r\nfrom whence it resulted that his being carried on board the Crescent\r\nand so long detained there, had been an act of wrong, which called\r\nfor expiatory conduct and attentions, rather than new injuries on his\r\npart towards the sufferer, instead of discharging him according to the\r\norders he had received, on his arrival in port, which was on the 14th\r\nof September, he, on the 15th, confined him in irons for several hours,\r\nthen had him bound and scourged in presence of the ship's crew, under a\r\nthreat to the executioner that if he did not do his duty well, he should\r\ntake the place of the sufferer. At length he discharged him on the 17th,\r\nwithout the means of subsistence for a single day. To establish these\r\nfacts, I enclose you copies of papers communicated to me by Mr. Cutting,\r\nwho laid the case of Purdie before the board of admiralty, and who can\r\ncorroborate them by his personal evidence. He can especially verify the\r\nletter of Captain Young, were it necessary to verify a paper, the original\r\nof which is under the command of his Majesty's ministers, and this paper\r\nis so material, as to supersede of itself all other testimony, confessing\r\nthe orders to discharge Purdie, that yet he had whipped him, and that\r\nit was impossible, without giving up all sense of discipline, to avoid\r\nwhipping a free American citizen. We have such confidence in the justice\r\nof the British government, in their friendly regard to these States, in\r\ntheir respect for the honor and good understanding of the two countries,\r\ncompromitted by this act of their officer, as not to doubt their due\r\nnotice of _him_, indemnification to the sufferer, and a friendly assurance\r\nto these States that effectual measures shall be adopted in future, to\r\nprotect the persons of their citizens while in British ports.\r\n\r\nBy the express command of the President of the United States, you are\r\nto lay this case, and our sense of it, before his Britannic Majesty's\r\nminister for Foreign Affairs, to urge it on his particular notice by all\r\nthe motives which it calls up, and to communicate to me the result.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, December 23, 1790.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--The vexations of our seamen and their sufferings under\r\nthe press-gangs of England, have become so serious, as to oblige\r\nour government to take serious notice of it. The particular case has\r\nbeen selected where the insult to the United States has been the most\r\nbarefaced, the most deliberately intentional, and the proof the most\r\ncomplete. The enclosed letter to you is on that subject, and has been\r\nwritten on the supposition that you would show the original to the Duke\r\nof Leeds, and give him a copy of it, but as of your own movement, and\r\nnot as if officially instructed so to do. You will be pleased to follow\r\nup this matter as closely as decency will permit, pressing it in firm\r\nbut respectful terms, on all occasions. We think it essential that\r\nCaptain Young's case may be an example to others. The enclosed letters\r\nare important. Be so good as to have them conveyed by the surest means\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n                                                         December 29, 1790.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson presents his respectful compliments to the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, and his condolences on the accident of the other evening,\r\nwhich he hopes has produced no serious loss.\r\n\r\nHe encloses to the Secretary of the Treasury a report of a committee of\r\nthe National Assembly of France, on the subject of Billon, containing more\r\nparticular information as to that species of coin than he had before met\r\nwith. If the metal be so mixed as to make it of 1-5 of the intrinsic value\r\nof the standard silver coin of the United States, the cent of billon will\r\nbe a little smaller than the present 16ths of dollars, and consequently be\r\nmore convenient than a copper cent. This he submits to the better judgment\r\nof the Secretary of the Treasury, and hopes he will consider the liberty\r\ntaken as an advance towards unreserved communications for reciprocal\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, January 23, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--The 3d and subsequent amendments to the constitution have\r\nbeen agreed to by New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The\r\nfirst by New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Maryland,\r\nNorth and South Carolina, and the second by only New Jersey, Delaware,\r\nMaryland, and the two Carolinas. The other States, viz. Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, Virginia and Georgia, have not decided on them. Vermont\r\nhas acceded to the new Constitution of the United States, and is coming\r\nforward to ask admission into Congress. Kentucky has asked the same,\r\nand a bill for the purpose has passed the Senate, and is now before the\r\nRepresentatives, where it will meet with no difficulty. But they have only\r\nasked admission for the year 1792.\r\n\r\nThe census had made considerable progress, but will not be completed till\r\nmidsummer. It is judged at present that our numbers will be between four\r\nand five millions. Virginia it is supposed will be between 7 and 800,000.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive by the papers that the object of our Indian expedition\r\nhas been so imperfectly obtained, as to call for another the ensuing\r\nyear. By the present conveyance you will probably receive a proclamation,\r\nlocating the federal territory so as to comprehend Georgetown. It will\r\nappear within a day or two. We must still pursue the redemption of our\r\ncaptives through the same channel, till some better means can be devised.\r\nThe money, however, which is in Mr. Grand's hands, will be the subject\r\nof a letter to you from the Secretary of the Treasury, as soon as he can\r\nhave an act of Congress authorizing the application of it to the debt of\r\nthe foreign officers.\r\n\r\nThe most important matters now before Congress are propositions to\r\nestablish a bank, to establish a land office and excise. The latter\r\nmeasure, though severely modified, is very unpopular in the middle and\r\nsouthern States.\r\n\r\nFenno's and Davies' papers will accompany this. These contain all the laws\r\nof the last session, and therefore it is thought better to defer sending\r\nthem to you in a body, till a third edition appears, which is proposed to\r\nbe printed, as this will be more conveniently conveyed as well as handled.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MASON.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, February 4, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I am to make you my acknowledgments for your favor of January\r\n10th, and the information from France which it contained. It confirmed\r\nwhat I had heard more loosely before, and accounts still more recent are\r\nto the same effect. I look with great anxiety for the firm establishment\r\nof the new government in France, being perfectly convinced that if it\r\ntakes place there, it will spread sooner or later all over Europe. On\r\nthe contrary, a check there would retard the revival of liberty in other\r\ncountries. I consider the establishment and success of their government\r\nas necessary to stay up our own, and to prevent it from falling back to\r\nthat kind of a half-way house, the English constitution. It cannot be\r\ndenied that we have among us a sect who believe that to contain whatever\r\nis perfect in human institutions; that the members of this sect have,\r\nmany of them, names and offices which stand high in the estimation of our\r\ncountrymen. I still rely that the great mass of our community is untainted\r\nwith these heresies, as is its head. On this I build my hope that we have\r\nnot labored in vain, and that our experiment will still prove that men\r\ncan be governed by reason. You have excited my curiosity in saying \"there\r\nis a particular circumstance, little attended to, which is continually\r\nsapping the republicanism of the United States.\" What is it? What is said\r\nin our country of the fiscal arrangements now going on? I really fear\r\ntheir effect when I consider the present temper of the southern States.\r\nWhether these measures be right or wrong abstractedly, more attention\r\nshould be paid to the general opinion. However, all will pass--the excise\r\nwill pass--the bank will pass. The only corrective of what is corrupt in\r\nour present form of government will be the augmentation of the numbers in\r\nthe lower House, so as to get a more agricultural representation, which\r\nmay put that interest above that of the stock-jobbers.\r\n\r\nI had no occasion to sound Mr. Madison on your fears expressed in your\r\nletter. I knew before, as possessing his sentiments fully on that subject,\r\nthat his value for you was undiminished. I have always heard him say that\r\nthough you and he appeared to differ in your systems, yet you were in\r\ntruth nearer together than most persons who were classed under the same\r\nappellation. You may quiet yourself in the assurance of possessing his\r\ncomplete esteem. I have been endeavoring to obtain some little distinction\r\nfor our useful customers, the French. But there is a particular interest\r\nopposed to it, which I fear will prove too strong. We shall soon see.\r\nI will send you a copy of a report I have given in, as soon as it is\r\nprinted. I know there is one part of it contrary to your sentiments; yet\r\nI am not sure you will not become sensible that a change should be slowly\r\npreparing. Certainly, whenever I pass your road, I shall do myself the\r\npleasure of turning into it. Our last year's experiment, however, is much\r\nin favor of that by Newgate.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect and esteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES HELLSTEDT, SWEDISH CONSUL.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, February 14, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I now return you the papers you were pleased to put into my hands,\r\nwhen you expressed to me your dissatisfaction that our court of admiralty\r\nhad taken cognizance of a complaint of some Swedish sailors against\r\ntheir captain for cruelty. If there was error in this proceeding, the law\r\nallows an appeal from that to the Supreme Court; but the appeal must be\r\nmade in the forms of the law, which have nothing difficult in them. You\r\nwere certainly free to conduct the appeal yourself, without employing an\r\nadvocate, but then you must do it in the usual form. Courts of justice,\r\nall over the world, are held by the laws to proceed according to certain\r\nforms, which the good of the suitors themselves requires they should not\r\nbe permitted to depart from.\r\n\r\nI have further to observe to you, Sir, that this question lies altogether\r\nwith the courts of justice; that the constitution of the United States\r\nhaving divided the powers of government into three branches, legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judiciary, and deposited each with a separate body of\r\nmagistracy, forbidding either to interfere in the department of the other,\r\nthe executive are not at liberty to intermeddle in the present question.\r\nIt must be ultimately decided by the Supreme Court. If you think proper to\r\ncarry it into that, you may be secure of the strictest justice from them.\r\nPartialities they are not at liberty to show. But, for whatever may come\r\nbefore the executive, relative to your nation, I can assure you of every\r\nfavor which may depend on their dispositions to cultivate harmony and a\r\ngood understanding with it.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAZARD.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, February 18, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I return you the two volumes of records, with thanks for the\r\nopportunity of looking into them. They are curious monuments of the\r\ninfancy of our country. I learn with great satisfaction that you are about\r\ncommitting to the press the valuable historical and State papers you have\r\nbeen so long collecting. Time and accident are committing daily havoc on\r\nthe originals deposited in our public offices. The late war has done the\r\nwork of centuries in this business. The last cannot be recovered, but\r\nlet us save what remains; not by vaults and locks which fence them from\r\nthe public eye and use in consigning them to the waste of time, but by\r\nsuch a multiplication of copies, as shall place them beyond the reach of\r\naccident. This being the tendency of your undertaking, be assured there is\r\nno one who wishes it more success than, Sir, your most obedient and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ----.[3]\r\n                                           Philadelphia, February 19, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I feel both the wish and the duty to communicate, in compliance\r\nwith your request, whatever, within my knowledge, might render justice\r\nto the memory of our great countrymen, Dr. Franklin, in which Philosophy\r\nhas to deplore one of its principal luminaries extinguished. But my\r\nopportunities of knowing the interesting facts of his life, have not been\r\nequal to my desire of making them known. I could indeed relate a number\r\nof those bon mots, with which he used to charm every society, as having\r\nheard many of them. But these are not your object. Particulars of greater\r\ndignity happened not to occur during his stay of nine months, after my\r\narrival in France.\r\n\r\nA little before that, Argand had invented his celebrated lamp, in which\r\nthe flame is spread into a hollow cylinder, and thus brought into contact\r\nwith the air within as well as without. Doctor Franklin had been on the\r\npoint of the same discovery. The idea had occurred to him; but he had\r\ntried a bull-rush as a wick, which did not succeed. His occupations did\r\nnot permit him to repeat and extend his trials to the introduction of a\r\nlarger column of air than could pass through the stem of a bull-rush.\r\n\r\nThe animal magnetism too of the maniac Mesmer, had just received its\r\ndeath wound from his hand in conjunction with his brethren of the learned\r\ncommittee appointed to unveil that compound of fraud and folly. But after\r\nthis, nothing very interesting was before the public, either in philosophy\r\nor politics, during his stay; and he was principally occupied in winding\r\nup his affairs there.\r\n\r\nI can only therefore testify in general, that there appeared to me more\r\nrespect and veneration attached to the character of Doctor Franklin in\r\nFrance, than to that of any other person in the same country, foreign\r\nor native. I had opportunities of knowing particularly how far these\r\nsentiments were felt by the foreign ambassadors and ministers at the court\r\nof Versailles. The fable of his capture by the Algerines, propagated by\r\nthe English newspapers, excited no uneasiness; as it was seen at once\r\nto be a dish cooked up to the palate of their readers. But nothing could\r\nexceed the anxiety of his diplomatic brethren, on a subsequent report of\r\nhis death, which, though premature, bore some marks of authenticity.\r\n\r\nI found the ministers of France equally impressed with the talents and\r\nintegrity of Dr. Franklin. The Count de Vergennes particularly gave me\r\nrepeated and unequivocal demonstrations of his entire confidence in him.\r\n\r\nWhen he left Passy, it seemed as if the village had lost its patriarch. On\r\ntaking leave of the court, which he did by letter, the King ordered him to\r\nbe handsomely complimented, and furnished him with a litter and mules of\r\nhis own, the only kind of conveyance the state of his health could bear.\r\n\r\nNo greater proof of his estimation in France can be given than the late\r\nletters of condolence on his death, from the National Assembly of that\r\ncountry, and the community of Paris, to the President of the United\r\nStates and to Congress, and their public mourning on that event. It is,\r\nI believe, the first instance of that homage having been paid by a public\r\nbody of one nation to a private citizen of another.\r\n\r\nHis death was an affliction which was to happen to us at some time or\r\nother. We have reason to be thankful he was so long spared; that the most\r\nuseful life should be the longest also; that it was protracted so far\r\nbeyond the ordinary span allotted to man, as to avail us of his wisdom in\r\nthe establishment of our own freedom, and to bless him with a view of its\r\ndawn in the east, where they seemed, till now, to have learned everything,\r\nbut how to be free.\r\n\r\nThe succession to Dr. Franklin, at the court of France, was an excellent\r\nschool of humility. On being presented to any one as the minister of\r\nAmerica, the commonplace question used in such cases was \"_c'est vous,\r\nMonsieur, qui remplace le Docteur Franklin?_\" \"it is you, Sir, who replace\r\nDoctor Franklin?\" I generally answered, \"no one can replace him, Sir: I\r\nam only his successor.\"\r\n\r\nThese small offerings to the memory of our great and dear friend, whom\r\ntime will be making greater while it is spunging us from its records, must\r\nbe accepted by you, Sir, in that spirit of love and veneration for him,\r\nin which they are made; and not according to their insignificance in the\r\neyes of a world, who did not want this mite to fill up the measure of his\r\nworth.\r\n\r\nI pray you to accept, in addition, assurances of the sincere esteem and\r\nrespect with which I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n     [3] [Address illegible.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR HANCOCK.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, February 20, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--With many thanks for the papers and information you were pleased\r\nto have procured for me on the important subject of the fisheries, I do\r\nmyself the honor of now enclosing you a copy of my report to the House of\r\nRepresentatives. From the disposition I see prevailing in the principal\r\nmass of the Southern members to take measures which may secure to us the\r\nprincipal markets for the produce of the fisheries, and for rescuing our\r\ncarrying trade from a nation not disposed to make just returns for it,\r\nI am in hopes something effectual will be done this session, if these\r\nprinciples are solidly supported by the members from your part of the\r\nUnion, of which I trust there is no cause to doubt. Should nothing be\r\ndone, I cannot say what consequences will follow, nor calculate their\r\nextent. May I take the liberty of presenting through you, Sir, another\r\ncopy of the report to the committee who were pleased to lend their\r\nassistance in the collection of materials; to show them that I have not\r\nfailed to present their testimony in that view which might tend to procure\r\na proper interference in this interesting branch of business.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect respect and\r\nattachment, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE PINTO.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, February 21, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have duly received the letter of November the 30th, which your\r\nExcellency did me the honor to write, informing me that her most faithful\r\nMajesty had appointed Mr. Freire her minister resident with us, and\r\nstating the difficulty of meeting us in the exchange of a chargé des\r\naffaires, the grade proposed on our part. It is foreseen, that a departure\r\nfrom our system in this instance, will materially affect our arrangements\r\nwith other nations; but the President of the United States has resolved\r\nto give her Majesty this proof of his desire to concur in whatever may\r\nbest tend to promote that harmony and perfect friendship so interesting\r\nto both countries. He has, therefore, appointed Colonel Humphreys to be\r\nminister resident for the United States, at the court of her Majesty.\r\nThis gentleman has long been of the President's own family, and enjoys\r\nhis particular confidence. I make no doubt he will so conduct himself as\r\nto give perfect satisfaction to her Majesty and yourself, and I therefore\r\nrecommend him to your friendly attention and respect. Mr. Freire will\r\nhave every title to the same from us, and will assuredly receive it. It\r\nis always with pleasure, that I repeat the homage of those sentiments of\r\nrespect and esteem with which I have the honor to be, your Excellency's\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PHILIP FRENEAU.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, February 28, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--The clerkship for foreign languages in my office is vacant. The\r\nsalary, indeed, is very low, being but two hundred and fifty dollars a\r\nyear; but also, it gives so little to do, as not to interfere with any\r\nother calling the person may choose, which would not absent him from the\r\nseat of government. I was told a few days ago, that it might perhaps be\r\nconvenient to you to accept it. If so, it is at your service. It requires\r\nno other qualification than a moderate knowledge of the French. Should\r\nanything better turn up within my department that might suit you, I should\r\nbe very happy to be able to bestow it so well. Should you conclude to\r\naccept the present, you may consider it as engaged to you, only be so good\r\nas to drop me a line informing me of your resolution. I am, with great\r\nesteem, Sir, your very humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE MOUSTIER.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, March 2, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have received your favor of November 6th, wherein you inform me\r\nthat the King has thought proper, by a new mission to the court of Berlin,\r\nto put an end to your functions as his minister plenipotentiary with the\r\nUnited States. The President, in a letter to the King, has expressed his\r\nsense of your merit, and his entire approbation of your conduct while\r\nhere, and has charged me to convey to yourself the same sentiments on his\r\npart.\r\n\r\nHad you returned to your station with us, you would have received new\r\nand continued marks of the esteem inspired by the general worth of your\r\ncharacter, as well by the particular dispositions you manifested towards\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nAmidst the regrets excited by so early a loss of you, it will be a\r\nconsolation, if your new situation shall contribute to advance your own\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nAs a testimony of these sentiments, we ask your acceptance of a medal and\r\nchain of gold, with which Mr. Short is instructed to present you on the\r\npart of the United States.\r\n\r\nTo this general tribute, permit me to add my own, with sincere wishes for\r\nyour constant happiness, and assurances of the respect and esteem with\r\nwhich I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. INNES.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, March 7, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Your favor of July 8, came to my hands November 30. The\r\ninfrequency of conveyances, is an apology for this late answer. I receive\r\nwith pleasure this recognition and renewal of your former acquaintance,\r\nand shall be happy to continue it by an exchange of epistolary\r\ncommunications. Yours to me will be always welcome. Your first gives\r\nme information in the line of Natural History, and the second (not yet\r\nreceived) promises political news. The first is my passion, the last my\r\nduty, and therefore both desirable. I believe entirely with you, that\r\nthe remains of fortifications found in the Western country, have been\r\nthe works of the natives. Nothing I have ever yet heard of, proved the\r\nexistence of a nation here who knew the use of iron. I have never heard\r\neven of _burnt_ bricks, though they might be made without iron. The statue\r\nyou have been so kind as to send me, and for which I beg you to accept my\r\nthanks, would, because of the hardness of the stone, be a better proof of\r\nthe use of iron, than I ever yet saw; but as it is a solitary fact, and\r\npossible to have been made with implements of stone, and great patience,\r\nfor which the Indians are remarkable, I consider it to have been so\r\nmade. It is certainly the best piece of workmanship I ever saw from their\r\nhands. If the artist did not intend it, he has very happily hit on the\r\nrepresentation of a woman in the first moments of parturition.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown, the bearer of this, will give you the Congressional news,\r\nsome good, some so so, like everything else in this world. Our endeavors\r\nthe last year to punish your enemies have had an unfortunate issue. The\r\nfederal council has yet to learn by experience, which experience has long\r\nago taught us in Virginia, that rank and file fighting will not do against\r\nIndians. I hope this year's experiment will be made in a more auspicious\r\nform. Will it not be possible for you to bring General Clark forward? I\r\nknow the greatness of his mind, and am the more mortified at the cause\r\nwhich obscures it. Had not this unhappily taken place, there was nothing\r\nhe might not have hoped: could it be surmounted, his lost ground might\r\nyet be recovered. No man alive rated him higher than I did, and would\r\nagain, were he to become again what I knew him. We are made to hope he\r\nis engaged in writing the account of his expeditions north of Ohio. They\r\nwill be valuable morsels of history, and will justify to the world those\r\nwho have told them how great he was.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown will tell you also that we are not inattentive to the interests\r\nof your navigation. Nothing short of actual rupture is omitted. What its\r\neffect will be, we cannot yet foretell; but we should not stop even here,\r\nwere a favorable conjuncture to arise. The move we have now made must\r\nbring the matter to issue. I can assure you of the most determined zeal\r\nof our chief magistrate in this business, and I trust mine will not be\r\ndoubted so far as it can be of any avail. The nail will be driven as far\r\nas it will go peaceably, and farther the moment that circumstances become\r\nfavorable. I am, with great esteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF FRANCE.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, March 8, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have it in charge from the President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, to communicate to the National Assembly of France, the peculiar\r\nsensibility of Congress to the tribute paid to the memory of Benjamin\r\nFranklin, by the enlightened and free representatives of a great nation,\r\nin their decree of the 11th of June, 1790.\r\n\r\nThat the loss of such a citizen should be lamented by us, among whom he\r\nlived, whom he so long and eminently served, and who feel their country\r\nadvanced and honored by his birth, life and labors, was to be expected.\r\nBut it remained for the National Assembly of France, to set the first\r\nexample of the representative of one nation, doing homage, by a public\r\nact, to the private citizen of another, and by withdrawing arbitrary\r\nlines of separation, to reduce into our fraternity the good and the great,\r\nwherever they have lived or died.\r\n\r\nThat these separations may disappear between us in all times and\r\ncircumstances, and that the union of sentiment which mingles our sorrows\r\non this occasion, may continue long to cement the friendship and the\r\ninterests of our two nations, is our constant prayer. With no one is\r\nit more sincere than with him, who, in being charged with the honor of\r\nconveying a public sentiment, is permitted that of expressing the homage\r\nof profound respect and veneration with which he is, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR QUESADA.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 10, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--We have received with great satisfaction, notification of the\r\norders of his Catholic Majesty, not to permit that persons, held in\r\nslavery within the United States, introduce themselves as free persons\r\ninto the Province of Florida. The known justice of his Majesty and his\r\nGovernment, was a certain dependence to us, that such would be his\r\nwill. The assurances your Excellency has been pleased to give us of\r\nyour friendly dispositions, leave us no doubt you will have faithfully\r\nexecuted a regulation so essential to harmony and good neighborhood. As\r\na consequence of the same principles of justice and friendship, we trust\r\nthat your Excellency will permit, and aid the recovery of persons of the\r\nsame description, who have heretofore taken refuge within your Government.\r\nThe bearer hereof is authorized to wait on your Excellency to confer on\r\nthis subject, and to concur in such arrangements as you shall approve for\r\nthe recovery of such fugitives.\r\n\r\nI beg you to be assured that no occasion shall be neglected of proving our\r\ndispositions to reciprocate these principles of justice and friendship,\r\nwith the subjects of his Catholic Majesty, and that you will be pleased\r\nto accept the homage of those sentiments of respect and esteem, with which\r\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 12, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--The President has thought proper to appoint Colonel David\r\nHumphreys, minister resident for the United States at the court of Lisbon,\r\nwith a salary of four thousand five hundred dollars a year, and an outfit\r\nequal to a year's salary. Besides this, by a standing regulation, he will\r\nbe allowed his disbursements for gazettes transmitted here, translating\r\nand printing paper, where that shall be necessary, postage, couriers, and\r\nnecessary aids to _poor_ American sailors. An opportunity occurring, by a\r\nvessel sailing for Lisbon within a few days, to send him his commission,\r\nI shall be obliged to you to enable me to convey to him at the same time\r\nthe means of receiving his outfit in the first instance, and his salary\r\nand disbursements above described, in quarterly payments afterwards.\r\n\r\nAn act of Congress having authorized the President to take measures for\r\nprocuring a recognition of our treaty from the new Emperor of Morocco,\r\narrangements for that purpose have been decided. The act allows twenty\r\nthousand dollars for this object, but not more than thirteen thousand\r\ndollars will be called for in the first instance, if at all, and these,\r\nor the means of drawing for them, not till six weeks hence. I thought it\r\nproper, however, to apprise you of the call at the earliest day possible,\r\nand while the President is here, and to ask your attention to it. I have\r\nthe honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect respect and esteem,\r\ndear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAJOR L'ENFANT.\r\n\r\n                                                            March --, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--You are desired to proceed to Georgetown, where you will find Mr.\r\nEllicott employed in making a survey and map of the Federal territory. The\r\nspecial object of asking your aid is to have drawings of the particular\r\ngrounds most likely to be approved for the site of the federal town and\r\nbuildings. You will therefore be pleased to begin on the eastern branch,\r\nand proceed from thence upwards, laying down the hills, valleys, morasses,\r\nand waters between that, the Potomac, the Tyber, and the road leading from\r\nGeorgetown to the eastern branch, and connecting the whole with certain\r\nfixed points of the map Mr. Ellicott is preparing. Some idea of the height\r\nof the hills above the base on which they stand, would be desirable. For\r\nnecessary assistance and expenses, be pleased to apply to the Mayor of\r\nGeorgetown, who is written to on this subject. I will beg the favor of\r\nyou to mark to me your progress about twice a week, by letter, say every\r\nWednesday and Saturday evening, that I may be able in proper time to draw\r\nyour attention to some other objects, which I have not at this moment\r\nsufficient information to define. I am, with great esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 12, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I enclose, you a statement of the case of Joseph St. Marie, a\r\ncitizen of the United States of America, whose clerk, Mr. Swimmer, was,\r\nin the latter part of the year 1787, seized on the eastern side of the\r\nMississippi, in latitude 34° 40', together with his goods, of the value of\r\nnineteen hundred and eighty dollars, by a party of Spanish soldiers. They\r\njustified themselves under the order of a Mr. Valliere, their officer,\r\nwho avowed authority from the Governor of New Orleans, requiring him to\r\nseize and confiscate all property _found on either side of the Mississippi\r\nbelow the mouth of the Ohio_. The matter being then carried by St. Marie\r\nbefore the Governor of New Orleans, instead of correcting the injury,\r\nhe avowed the act and its principle, and pretended orders from his court\r\nfor this and more. We have so much confidence, however, in the moderation\r\nand friendship of the court of Madrid, that we are more ready to ascribe\r\nthis outrage to officers acting at a distance, than to orders from a\r\njust sovereign. We have hitherto considered the delivery of the post of\r\nthe Natchez, on the part of Spain, as only awaiting the result of those\r\narrangements which have been under amicable discussion between us; but the\r\nremaining in possession of a post which is so near our limit of thirty-one\r\ndegrees, as to admit some color of doubt whether it be on our side or\r\ntheirs, is one thing; while it is a very different one, to launch two\r\nhundred and fifty miles further, and seize the persons and property of our\r\ncitizens; and that too, in the very moment that a friendly accommodation\r\nof all differences, is under discussion. Our respect for their candor and\r\ngood faith does not permit us to doubt, that proper notice will be taken\r\nof the presumption of their officer, who has thus put to hazard the peace\r\nof both nations, and we particularly expect that indemnification will be\r\nmade to the individual injured. On this you are desired to insist in the\r\nmost friendly terms, but with that earnestness and perseverance which the\r\ncomplexion of this wrong requires. The papers enclosed will explain the\r\nreasons of the delay which has intervened. It is but lately they have been\r\nput into the hands of our government.\r\n\r\nWe cannot omit this occasion of urging on the court of Madrid, the\r\nnecessity of hastening a final acknowledgment of our right to navigate\r\nthe Mississippi; a right which has been long suspended in exercise, with\r\nextreme inconvenience on our part, merely with a desire of reconciling\r\nSpain to what it is impossible for us to relinquish. An accident at\r\nthis day, like that now complained of, would put further parley beyond\r\nour power; yet to such accidents we are every day exposed by the\r\nirregularities of their officers, and the impatience of our citizens.\r\nShould any spark kindle these dispositions of our borderers into a flame,\r\nwe are involved beyond recall by the eternal principles of justice to\r\nour citizens, which we will never abandon. In such an event, Spain cannot\r\npossibly gain, and what may she not lose?\r\n\r\nThe boldness of this act of the Governor of New Orleans, and of his avowal\r\nof it, renders it essential to us to understand the court of Spain on this\r\nsubject. You will, therefore, avail yourself of the earliest occasion of\r\nobtaining their sentiments, and of communicating them to us.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 12, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--The enclosed papers will explain to you a case which imminently\r\nendangers the peace of the United States with Spain. It is not, indeed,\r\nof recent date, but it has been recently laid before government, and\r\nis of so bold a feature as to render dangerous to our rights a further\r\nacquiescence in their suspension. The middle ground held by France between\r\nus and Spain, both in friendship and interest, requires that we should\r\ncommunicate with her with the fullest confidence on this occasion. I\r\ntherefore enclose you a copy of my letter to Mr. Carmichael, and of the\r\npapers it refers to, to be communicated to Monsieur de Montmorin, whose\r\nefficacious interference with the court of Madrid you are desired to ask.\r\nWe rely with great confidence on his friendship, justice and influence.\r\n\r\nA cession of the navigation of the Mississippi, with such privileges\r\nas to make it useful, and free from future chicane, can be no longer\r\ndispensed with on our part; and perhaps while I am writing, something may\r\nhave already happened to cut off this appeal to friendly accommodation.\r\nTo what consequences such an event would lead, cannot be calculated. To\r\nsuch, very possibly, as we should lament, without being able to control.\r\nYour earnestness with Monsieur de Montmorin, and with the court of\r\nSpain, cannot be more pressing than the present situation and temper of\r\nthis country requires. The case of St. Marie happens to be the incident\r\npresenting itself in the moment, when the general question must otherwise\r\nhave been brought forward. We rely, on this occasion, on the good offices\r\nof the Marquis de La Fayette, whom you are desired to interest in it.\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere and great esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL INNES.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 13, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat is said with you of the most prominent proceedings of the last\r\nCongress? The disapprobation of the assumption with you leads us naturally\r\nto attend to your reception of laws for carrying it into effect, which\r\nhave been thought to present themselves in an unfavorable view. What\r\nwill be thought of measures taken to force Great Britain by a navigation\r\nact, to come forward in fair treaty, and let us substantially into her\r\nislands, as a price for the advantages of navigation and commerce which\r\nshe now derives from us? This is interesting to our agriculture, provided\r\nthe means adopted be sufficiently gradual. I wish you would come forward\r\nto the federal legislature and give your assistance on a larger scale\r\nthan that on which you are acting at present. I am satisfied you could\r\nrender essential service; and I have such confidence in the purity\r\nof your republicanism, that I know your efforts would go in a right\r\ndirection. Zeal and talents added to the republican scale will do no\r\nharm in Congress. It is fortunate that our first executive magistrate is\r\npurely and zealously republican. We cannot expect all his successors to\r\nbe so, and therefore should avail ourselves the present day to establish\r\nprinciples and examples which may fence us against future heresies\r\npreached now, to be practised hereafter. I repeat my wish that I could see\r\nyou come into the federal councils; no man living joining more confidence\r\nin your principles and talents to higher personal esteem than, dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 15, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--In mine of January the 23d, I acknowledged the receipt of your\r\nletters from No. 29 to 48 inclusive, except 31, 44, 45, 46. Since that I\r\nhave received Nos. 45 and 50; the former in three months and seven days,\r\nthe latter in two months and seventeen days, by the English packet, which\r\nhad an uncommonly long passage. Nos. 31, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, are still\r\nmissing. They have probably come through merchant vessels and merchants,\r\nwho will let them lie on their counters two or three months before they\r\nwill forward them. I wrote you on the 8th and 12th instant, by a private\r\nhand, on particular subjects. I am not certain whether this will be in\r\ntime to go by the same conveyance. In yours of December 23d, you suppose\r\nwe receive regularly the journals of the National Assembly from your\r\nsecretary at Paris, but we have never received anything from him. Nothing\r\nhas been addressed to him, his name being unknown to us.\r\n\r\nIt gives great satisfaction that the _Arret du Conseil_ of December,\r\n1787, stands a chance of being saved. It is, in truth, the sheet-anchor\r\nof our connection with France, which will be much loosened when that\r\nis lost. This _Arret_ saved, a free importation of salted meats into\r\nFrance, and of provisions of all kinds into her colonies, will bind our\r\ninterests to that country more than to all the world besides. It has\r\nbeen proposed in Congress to pass a navigation act, which will deeply\r\nstrike at that of Great Britain. I send you a copy of it. It is probable\r\nthe same proposition will be made at the next Congress, as a first step,\r\nand for one more extensive at a later period. It is thought the first\r\nwill be carried; the latter will be more doubtful. Would it not be worth\r\nwhile to have the bill now enclosed, translated, printed and circulated\r\namong the members of the National Assembly? If you think so, have it done\r\nat the public expense, with any little comment you may think necessary,\r\nconcealing the quarter from whence it is distributed; or take any other\r\nmethod you think better, to see whether that Assembly will not pass a\r\nsimilar act. I shall send copies of it to Mr. Carmichael, at Madrid, and\r\nto Colonel Humphreys, appointed resident at Lisbon, with a desire for them\r\nto suggest similar acts there. The measure is just, perfectly innocent as\r\nto all other nations, and will effectually defeat the navigation act of\r\nGreat Britain, and reduce her power on the ocean within safer limits.\r\n\r\nThe time of the late Congress having expired on the 3d instant, they then\r\nseparated of necessity. Much important matter was necessarily laid over;\r\nthis navigation act among others. The land law was put off, and nothing\r\nfarther done with the mint than to direct workmen to be engaged. The new\r\nCongress will meet on the 4th Monday in October. Their laws shall be sent\r\nyou by the first opportunity after they shall be printed. You will receive\r\nherewith those of their second session. We know that Massachusetts has\r\nagreed to the amendments to the Constitution, except (as is said) the\r\nfirst, second, and twelfth articles. The others, therefore, are now in\r\nforce. The articles excepted will depend on the other legislatures. The\r\nlate expedition against the northern Indians having been ineffectual, more\r\nserious operations against them will be undertaken as soon as the season\r\nadmits. The President is just now setting out on a tour to the southern\r\nStates, from whence he will not return till June. The British packet being\r\nthe quickest mode of conveyance, I shall avail myself of that, as well\r\nas of the French packet, to write to you. Are the letters which now pass\r\nthrough the French post offices opened, as they were under the former\r\ngovernment? This is important for me to know.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. I omitted to draw your attention to an additional duty of one cent\r\nper gallon on rum, by name. This was intended as some discrimination\r\nbetween England and France. It would have been higher, but for the fear\r\nof affecting the revenues in a contrary direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 19, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Your letter of November the 6th, No. 46, by Mr. Osmont, came\r\nto hand yesterday, and I have just time, before the departure of Mr.\r\nTerrasson, the bearer of my letter of the 15th instant, and despatches\r\naccompanying it, to acknowledge the receipt, and inform you that it has\r\nbeen laid before the President. On consideration of the circumstances\r\nstated in the second page of your letter, he is of opinion, that it is\r\nexpedient to press at this moment a settlement of our difference with\r\nSpain. You are therefore desired, instead of confining your application\r\nfor the interference of the court of France, to the simple case of St.\r\nMarie, mentioned in my letter of the 12th, to ask it on the broad bottom\r\nof general necessity, that our right of navigating the Mississippi be\r\nat length ceded by the court of Madrid, and be ceded in such form, as to\r\nrender the exercise of it efficacious and free from chicane. This cannot\r\nbe without an entrepôt in some convenient port of the river, where the\r\nriver and sea craft may meet and exchange loads, without any control from\r\nthe laws of the Spanish government. This subject was so fully developed\r\nto you in my letter of August the 10th, 1790, that I shall at present\r\nonly refer to that. We wish you to communicate this matter fully to the\r\nMarquis de La Fayette, to ask his influence and assistance, assuring\r\nhim that a settlement of this matter is become indispensable to us; any\r\nfurther delay exposing our peace, both at home and abroad, to accidents,\r\nthe result of which are incalculable, and must no longer be hazarded. His\r\nfriendly interposition on this occasion, as well as that of his nation,\r\nwill be most sensibly felt by us. To his discretion, therefore, and yours,\r\nwe confide this matter, trusting that you will so conduct it as to obtain\r\nour right in an efficacious form; and at the same time to preserve to us\r\nthe friendship of France and Spain, the latter of which we value much,\r\nand the former infinitely.\r\n\r\nMr. Carmichael is instructed to press this matter at Madrid: yet if the\r\nMarquis and yourself think it could be better effected at Paris, with the\r\nCount de Nunnez, it is left to you to endeavor to try it there. Indeed,\r\nwe believe it would be more likely to be settled there, than at Madrid\r\nor here. Observe always, that to accept the navigation of the river\r\nwithout an entrepôt would be perfectly useless, and that an entrepôt, if\r\ntramelled, would be a certain instrument for bringing on war instead of\r\npreventing it.\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. WISTAR.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 20, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I am thankful for the trouble which yourself and Dr. Hutchinson\r\nhave taken, and are still willing to take, on the subject of Mr. Isaacs'\r\ndiscovery. However his method may turn out, this advantage will certainly\r\nresult from it, that having drawn the public attention to the subject, it\r\nmay be made the occasion of disseminating among the masters of vessels a\r\nknowledge of the fact, that fresh water may be obtained from salt water\r\nby a common distillation, and in abundance. Though Lind's, Irvine's, and\r\nMcQueer's experiments should suffice to satisfy them of this, yet it may\r\nfix their faith more firmly, if we can say to them that we have tried\r\nthese experiments ourselves, and can vouch for their effect. If Mr. Isaacs\r\ncan increase that effect, so much the better; it will be a new flower in\r\nthe American wreath. He is poor, and complains that his delay here is very\r\ndistressing to him. Therefore, I propose to-morrow for the experiment,\r\nand will ask the favor of you to fix any hour that may best suit the\r\nconvenience of Dr. Hutchinson and yourself, from five in the morning to\r\ntwelve at night, all being equal to me. Only be good as to notify it in\r\ntime for me to give notice to Mr. Isaacs. Will it not save time, if the\r\ngreat still can be set agoing at the same time with the small ones? He\r\nprotests against any unfavorable conclusions from a small experiment,\r\nbecause never having tried his method in a small way, he does not know\r\nhow to proportion his mixture. I am, with great esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR MARTIN.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 26, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--Having in charge to lay before Congress a general statement of all\r\nthe lands subject to their disposal, it becomes necessary for me, so far\r\nas respects the proceedings of North Carolina, to draw on a map the line\r\nwhich forms the Eastern boundary of the cession of that State to Congress,\r\nand then to specify all the private claims within the cession, which form\r\nexceptions to their general right of granting the ceded territory. Three\r\nclasses of these exceptions have been stated to me. First, the returns\r\nfrom Armstrong's office. Second, the claims of the officers of the North\r\nCarolina line of the lands reserved for them on the Cumberland. Third,\r\na grant of twenty-five thousand acres to General Greene. I find myself\r\nunder the necessity of troubling your Excellency to enable me to lay down\r\nwith precision this dividing line, and then a precise specification and\r\nlocation of the three classes of exceptions before mentioned, and also,\r\nany other exceptions which you may know of. Besides that these things\r\ncan be known only from your offices, I am induced to ask you to take the\r\ntrouble from an assurance that you will be glad to assist in furnishing\r\nany information which may prevent the citizens of your State from being\r\ninvolved in litigations by a sale to others of lands to which they may\r\nhave a just claim, and which would not be so sold, if their claims could\r\nbe previously known. As I propose to set about this statement immediately,\r\nI shall consider it as a great personal obligation, if the measures\r\nwhich your Excellency may be pleased to take for my assistance, can be\r\nimmediately executed, and the result communicated to me. I have the honor\r\nto be, with great esteem and respect, your Excellency's most obedient,\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 27, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have been again to see Mr. Barclay on the subject of his mission,\r\nand to hasten him. I communicated to him the draught of his instructions,\r\nand he made an observation which may render a small change expedient.\r\nYou know it has been concluded that he should go without any defined\r\ncharacter, in order to save expense. He observed that if his character\r\nwas undefined they would consider him as an Ambassador, and expect\r\nproportional liberalities, and he thought it best to fix his character\r\nto that of consul, which was the lowest that could be employed. Thinking\r\nthat there is weight in his opinion, I have the honor to enclose you a\r\nblank commission for him as consul, and another letter to the Emperor,\r\nno otherwise different from that you signed, but as having a clause of\r\ncredence in it. If you approve of this change, you will be so good as to\r\nsign these papers and return them; otherwise, the letter before signed\r\nwill still suffice.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a Massachusetts paper, whereby you will see that some acts\r\nof force have taken place on our eastern boundary. Probably that State\r\nwill send us authentic information of them. The want of an accurate map\r\nof the Bay of Passamaquoddy renders it difficult to form a satisfactory\r\nopinion on the point in contest. I write to-day to Rufus Putnam to send me\r\nhis survey referred to in his letters. There is a report that some acts of\r\nforce have taken place on the northern boundary of New York, and are now\r\nunder the consideration of the government of that State. The impossibility\r\nof bringing the court of London to an adjustment of any difference\r\nwhatever, renders our situation perplexing. Should any applications from\r\nthe States or their citizens be so urgent as to require something to be\r\nsaid before your return, my opinion would be that they should be desired\r\nto make no new settlements on our part, nor suffer any to be made on the\r\npart of the British, within the disputed territory; and if any attempt\r\nshould be made to remove them from the settlements already made, that\r\nthey are to repel force by force, and ask aid of the neighboring militia\r\nto do this and no more. I see no other safe way of forcing the British\r\ngovernment to come forward themselves and demand an amicable settlement.\r\nIf this idea meets your approbation, it may prevent a misconstruction by\r\nthe British, of what may happen, should I have this idea suggested in a\r\nproper manner to Colonel Beckwith.\r\n\r\nThe experiments which have been tried of distilling sea-water with\r\nIsaacs' mixture, and also without it, have been rather in favor of the\r\ndistillation without any mixture.\r\n\r\nA bill was yesterday ordered to be brought into the House of\r\nRepresentatives here, for granting a sum of money for building a Federal\r\nHall, house for the President, &c.\r\n\r\nYou knew of Mr. R. Morris' purchase of Gorham and Phelps of 1,300,000\r\nacres of land of the State of Massachusetts, at 5_d._ an acre. It is said\r\nthat he has sold 1,200,000 acres of these in Europe, through the agency\r\nof V. Franklin, who it seems went on this business conjointly with that\r\nof printing his grandfather's works. Mr. Morris, under the name of Ogden,\r\nand perhaps in partnership with him, has bought the residue of the lands\r\nheld in the same country by Massachusetts, for £100,000. The Indian title\r\nof the former purchase has been extinguished by Gorham, but that of the\r\nlatter is not. Perhaps it cannot be. In that case a similarity of interest\r\nwill produce an alliance with the Yazoo companies. Perhaps a sale may be\r\nmade in Europe to purchasers ignorant of the Indian right.\r\n\r\nI shall be happy to hear that no accident has happened to you in the bad\r\nroads you have passed, and that you are better prepared for those to come\r\nby lowering the hang of your carriage, and exchanging the coachman for two\r\npostilions, circumstances which I confess to you appeared to me essential\r\nfor your safety, for which no one on earth more sincerely prays, both\r\nfrom public and private regard, than he who has the honor to be, with\r\nsentiments of the most profound respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. LEWIS.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 31, 1791.\r\n\r\nThe recess of Congress permits me now to resume the subject of my letter\r\nof August 12th, and to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of September\r\n14th, November 25th, and January 1st. With respect to British debts and\r\nproperty it was thought possible then that they might come forward and\r\ndiscuss the interests and questions existing between the two nations,\r\nand as we know they would assail us on the subject of the treaty, without\r\nour previously knowing the particular State or States whose proceedings\r\nthey would make the ground of complaint, we wished to be in a state of\r\npreparation on every point. I am therefore to thank you particularly for\r\nhaving furnished us the justifications of this Commonwealth in your letter\r\nof January 1st. With respect to the more general object of my letter, that\r\nof making a very complete collection of all the laws in force, or which\r\nwere ever in force in the several States, we are now as to this State\r\npossessed of those from 1776 to 1790. I must still avail myself of your\r\nkind undertaking in your letters of September 14th and November 25th, to\r\ncontinue your attention to this acquisition till we can have the whole.\r\nIndeed, if you would order any bookseller to procure them according to\r\nsuch list as you should give him, it might greatly lessen your trouble,\r\nand he could deliver them himself at my office and receive there his pay.\r\nWhenever you shall be so good as to notify me of the cost of those already\r\nfurnished, it shall be immediately reimbursed. I am sure you are sensible\r\nof the necessity of possessing at the seat of the General Government,\r\na complete collection of all the laws of all the States, and hope you\r\nwill perceive there were no persons so likely to make the collection\r\njudiciously as the Attorneys for the Districts, which must be the apology\r\nfor the trouble which has been given you on this subject by him who has\r\nthe honor to be, with great esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient,\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, April 2, 1791.\r\n\r\nI had the honor of addressing you on the 27th ult., since which letters\r\nare received of January 24th, from Mr. Carmichael, and of January 3d and\r\n15th, Madrid, and February 6th, and 12th, Lisbon, from Colonel Humphreys.\r\nAs these are interesting, and may tend to settle suspense of mind to a\r\ncertain degree, I shall trouble you with quotations from some parts and\r\nthe substance of others.\r\n\r\nColonel H. says, \"I learn from other good authority, as well as from\r\nMr. Carmichael, that all the representations of Gardoqui (when minister\r\nin America), tended to excite a belief that the most respectable and\r\ninfluential people throughout the United States did not wish to have\r\nthe navigation of the Mississippi opened for years to come, from an\r\napprehension such an event would weaken the government, and impoverish\r\nthe Atlantic States by emigrations. It was even pretended that none but\r\na handful of settlers on the Western waters, and a few inhabitants of the\r\nSouthern States would acquiesce in the measure.\" This is the state of mind\r\nto which they have reverted since the crisis with England is passed, for\r\nduring that, the Count de Florida Blanca threw out general assertions that\r\nwe should have no reason to complain of their conduct with respect to the\r\nMississippi, which gave rise to the report its navigation was opened. The\r\nfollowing passages will be astonishing to you who recollect that there\r\nwas not a syllable in your letters to Mr. G. M., which looked in the\r\nmost distant manner to Spain. Mr. Carmichael says, \"something, however,\r\nmight have been done in a moment of projects and apprehension, had not\r\na certain negotiation carried on, on our part, at London, transpired,\r\nand which I think was known here rather from British policy, than from\r\nthe vigilance of the Marquis del Campo. Entirely unacquainted with this\r\nmanœuvre, although in correspondence with the person employed, I was\r\nsuspected to be in the secret. This suspicion banished confidence, which\r\nreturns by slow degrees. This circumstance induced me to drop entirely\r\nmy correspondence with G. M. To continue it would have done harm, and\r\ncertainly could do no good. I have seen extracts of the President's letter\r\ncommunicated to the Duke of Leeds, perhaps mutilated or forged to serve\r\nhere the views of the British cabinet. I do not yet despair of obtaining\r\ncopies of those letters through the same channel that I procured the first\r\naccount of the demands of G. B. and the signature of the late convention.\"\r\nColonel Humphreys says, \"the minister had intimations from del Campo of\r\nthe conferences between Mr. Morris and the Duke of Leeds, which occasioned\r\nhim to say with warmth to Mr. Carmichael, 'now is your time to make a\r\ntreaty with England.' Fitzherbert availed himself of these conferences to\r\ncreate apprehensions that the Americans would aid his nation in case of\r\nwar.\" Your genuine letter could have made no impression. The British court\r\nthen must have forged one, to suit their purpose, and I think it will not\r\nbe amiss to send a genuine copy to Carmichael, to place our faith on its\r\njust ground. The principal hope of doing anything now, is founded either\r\non an expected removal of the Count de F. B. from the ministry, in which\r\ncase persons will be employed who are more friendly to America, or to the\r\nbursting out of that fire which both gentlemen think but superficially\r\ncovered. Mr. Carmichael justifies himself by the interception of his\r\nletters. He has shown the originals to Colonel H. He concludes his present\r\nletter with these words, \"relying on the good opinion of me, that you have\r\nbeen pleased to express on many occasions, I intreat you to engage the\r\nPresident to permit me to return to my native country.\" Colonel Humphreys,\r\non the subjects of his justification and return says, (after speaking of\r\nthe persons likely to come into power,) \"Mr. Carmichael being on terms\r\nof intimacy with the characters here, is certainly capable of effecting\r\nmore at this court than any other American. He is heartily desirous of\r\naccomplishing the object in view at all events, and fully determined\r\nto return to America in twelve or eighteen months at farthest. He has\r\nexpressed that intention repeatedly. To be invested with full powers,\r\nperhaps he would be able to do something before his departure from the\r\ncontinent.\" In his letter of January 15th, he says, \"Mr. Carmichael's\r\nideas are just: his exertions will be powerful and unremitting to\r\nobtain the accomplishment of our desires before his departure from this\r\ncountry. The task will now be difficult if not impracticable.\" In that\r\nof February 6th, he says, \"Mr. Carmichael is much mortified that so many\r\nof his despatches have miscarried. By the original documents, which I\r\nhave seen in his hands, I am convinced he has been extremely assiduous\r\nand successful in procuring early and authentic intelligence. It is\r\ndifficult for a person at a distance to form an adequate judgment of the\r\nembarrassments to which a public man, situated as he was, is subjected,\r\nin making written communications, from such an inland place, and under\r\nsuch a jealous government. He appears disgusted with the country and the\r\nmode of life he is compelled to lead. He desires ardently to return to\r\nhis native land; but he wishes to distinguish himself first by rendering\r\nsome essential service to it if possible.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Quesada, by order of his court, is inviting foreigners to go and\r\nsettle in Florida. This is meant for our people. Debtors take advantage\r\nof it, and go off with their property. Our citizens have a right to go\r\nwhere they please. It is the business of the States to take measures to\r\nstop them till their debts are paid. This done, I wish a hundred thousand\r\nof our inhabitants would accept the invitation. It will be the means\r\nof delivering to us peaceably what may otherwise cost us a war. In the\r\nmeantime, we may complain of this seduction of our inhabitants just enough\r\nto make them believe we think it very wise policy for them, and confirm\r\nthem in it. This is my idea of it. I have the honor to be, with sentiments\r\nof the most perfect respect and attachment, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAJOR L'ENFANT.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, April 10, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I am favored with your letter of the 4th instant, and in compliance\r\nwith your request, I have examined my papers, and found the plans of\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Mayne, Carlsruhe, Amsterdam, Strasburg, Paris, Orleans,\r\nBordeaux, Lyons, Montpelier, Marseilles, Turin, and Milan, which I send\r\nin a roll by the post. They are on large and accurate scales, having\r\nbeen procured by me while in those respective cities myself. As they are\r\nconnected with the notes I made in my travels, and often necessary to\r\nexplain them to myself, I will beg your care of them, and to return them\r\nwhen no longer useful to you, leaving you absolutely free to keep them\r\nas long as useful. I am happy that the President has left the planning\r\nof the town in such good hands, and have no doubt it will be done to\r\ngeneral satisfaction. Considering that the grounds to be reserved for the\r\npublic are to be paid for by the acre, I think very liberal reservations\r\nshould be made for them; and if this be about the Tyber and on the back\r\nof the town, it will be of no injury to the commerce of the place, which\r\nwill undoubtedly establish itself on the deep waters towards the eastern\r\nbranch and mouth of Rock Creek; the water about the mouth of the Tyber\r\nnot being of any depth. Those connected with the government will prefer\r\nfixing themselves near the public grounds in the centre, which will also\r\nbe convenient to be resorted to as walks from the lower and upper town.\r\nHaving communicated to the President, before he went away, such general\r\nideas on the subject of the town as occurred to me, I make no doubt that,\r\nin explaining himself to you on the subject, he has interwoven with his\r\nown ideas, such of mine as he approved. For fear of repeating therefore\r\nwhat he did not approve, and having more confidence in the unbiassed\r\nstate of his mind, than in my own, I avoided interfering with what he\r\nmay have expressed to you. Whenever it is proposed to prepare plans for\r\nthe Capitol, I should prefer the adoption of some one of the models of\r\nantiquity, which have had the approbation of thousands of years; and for\r\nthe President's house, I should prefer the celebrated fronts of modern\r\nbuildings, which have already received the approbation of all good judges.\r\nSuch are the Galerie du Louire, the Gardes meubles, and two fronts of\r\nthe Hotel de Salm. But of this it is yet time enough to consider. In the\r\nmeantime I am, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, April 10, 1791.\r\n\r\nI had the honor of addressing you on the 2d instant, which I presume would\r\novertake you at Richmond. The present, I imagine, will not overtake you\r\ntill you get to Wilmington. Since my last, I have been honored with your\r\ntwo letters of March 31st, and two others of April 4th, one of which was\r\ncircular. A copy of this, I sent to the Vice-President, and as Colonel\r\nHamilton has asked a consultation on a letter of Mr. Short's, we shall\r\nhave a meeting with the Vice-President to-morrow. I will then ask their\r\nadvice also on the communication to Colonel Beckwith, relative to the\r\nsupplies to the Indians. Finding, within a day or two after my letter\r\nto you of March 27th, that Putnam was gone to the westward, I detained\r\nmy letter to him, and applied to General Knox, from whom I obtained some\r\ninformation on the Eastern boundary. No official information of the affair\r\nof Moose Island is received here. Perhaps it is on the road to you. Nor\r\ndo we hear anything more of the disturbance said to have arisen on the\r\nborders of New York. I have asked the favor of my friend Mr. Madison to\r\nthink on the subject of the consular commission to Mr. Barclay, so far as\r\nwe have done so and conferred together as yet. We are both of opinion it\r\nmay be used; but we shall think and confer further. I presume your only\r\ndoubt arose on the constitutional powers to \"supply vacancies\" during\r\nthe recess of Congress. There was an omission also (which might strike\r\nyour mind), of the limitation of the commission \"till the end of the next\r\nsession of Congress.\" As the Constitution limits them, this clause is\r\nalways useless; however, as it does no harm, it has been usually inserted\r\nin the commissions. But in the case of Mr. Barclay, such a clause would\r\nrequire a very awkward explanation to the Emperor of Morocco; and as\r\nMr. Barclay is acquainted with the constitutional determination of his\r\ncommission, it was thought better to omit the useless expression of it.\r\nThe acquisition of ground at Georgetown is really noble. Considering that\r\nonly £25 an acre is to be paid for any grounds taken for the public,\r\nand the streets not to be counted, which will in fact reduce it to\r\nabout £19 an acre, I think very liberal reserves should be made for the\r\npublic. Your proclamation came to hand the night of the 5th. Dunlap's\r\nand Bache's papers for the morning of the 6th being already filled, I\r\ncould only get it into Brown's evening paper of the 6th. On the 7th, the\r\nbill for the federal buildings passed the Representatives here by 42 to\r\n10, but it was rejected yesterday by 9 to 6 in the Senate, or to speak\r\nmore exactly, it was postponed till the next session. In the meantime,\r\nspirited proceedings at Georgetown will probably, under the continuance\r\nof your patronage, prevent the revival of the bill. I received last night\r\nfrom Major L'Enfant a request to furnish him any plans of towns I could,\r\nfor his examination. I accordingly send him, by this post, plans of\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Mayne, Carlsruhe, Amsterdam, Strasburg, Paris, Orleans,\r\nBordeaux, Lyons, Montpelier, Marseilles, Turin, and Milan, on large and\r\naccurate scales, which I procured while in those towns respectively.\r\nThey are none of them, however, comparable to the old Babylon, revived\r\nin Philadelphia, and exemplified. While in Europe, I selected about a\r\ndozen or two of the handsomest fronts of private buildings, of which I\r\nhave the plates. Perhaps it might decide the taste of the new town, were\r\nthese to be engraved here, and distributed gratis among the inhabitants\r\nof Georgetown. The expense would be trifling.\r\n\r\nI enclose you extracts from a letter of Mr. Short's of January 24th.\r\nOne of January 28th has since come to hand, containing nothing but a\r\ntranslation of the letter, said to have been written by the Emperor to\r\nthe King of France, but which he suspects to be a forgery, a forged bull\r\nof the Pope having lately appeared in the same way. He says very serious\r\ndifferences have arisen between the Minister of Prussia, at Liege, and\r\nthe imperial commanding officer there.\r\n\r\nI also enclose the debates of the Pennsylvania assembly on the bill for\r\nthe federal buildings, and the bill itself; and have the honor to be,\r\nwith sentiments of the most perfect respect and attachment, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract of a letter from William Short to Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of\r\nState, dated Amsterdam, January 24, 1791._\r\n\r\n\"No loan is yet opened; as far as I can judge it will be found proper\r\nto postpone it two or three weeks longer, for reasons mentioned in my\r\nformer letters, which are of general application, and in this instance\r\nparticularly for the greater certainty of a success that may enhance the\r\ncredit of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The Reporter of the Committee of Domaines has at length presented the\r\nopinion of that committee respecting the Decree on the _Droit d'Aubaine_\r\nto the assembly. He had unfortunately connected it with the business of\r\nthe Successions, so that an adjournment was insisted on in order that the\r\nReport might be discussed. It was referred to four different committees.\r\nI had put the Marquis de La Fayette fully in possession of this subject,\r\nand wrote to him again respecting it, immediately on being informed of\r\nthe turn it had taken. The Secretary, whom I left in Paris, writes me\r\nthat they are now trying to get the Diplomatic Committee to ask for a\r\ndivision of this report, and to obtain a decree explanatory merely as to\r\nthe _Droit d'Aubaine_. In the present ill-humor and jealousy which prevail\r\nwith respect to colonies, it is difficult to say what they will do--but we\r\nmay be sure that M. de Montmorin will use his exertions to effect what we\r\ndesire. I apprehend delay, however, which no application can prevent, and\r\nI always had doubts myself with respect to the success of this business,\r\nnotwithstanding the opinion of the Reporter and Committee of Domaines. I\r\nmentioned formerly on what those doubts were founded.\r\n\r\n\"Since the Report of the Committee of Impositions, made in the month of\r\nDecember, of which you will have seen an extract in the Journals of the\r\nAssembly, and of which I enclosed you a copy in my last, nothing more has\r\nbeen said on tobacco, except by a member of the Committee of Finance. You\r\nwill have seen that the Committee of Imposition propose to abandon tobacco\r\nas an article of revenue. The member of the Committee of Finance, on the\r\ncontrary, insisted on it; another member of the same committee, however,\r\ninsisted on his informing the assembly that what he said was his private\r\nopinion, and not that of the Committee of Finance. Nobody, as I have\r\nfrequently repeated, can say with certainty, when the Assembly will take\r\nup any subject, nor what they will decide on it. Their sentiments with\r\nrespect to tobacco, have experienced a manifest alteration since the first\r\nreport of the Committee of Imposition respecting it. It is probable now\r\nthat it will be made an article of free commerce, with a duty on entering\r\nthe kingdom. But should the Farm be continued, still some modification\r\nmay be expected at present in favor of their commercial connections with\r\nthe United States. I forgot to mention above, that I had received through\r\nMr. Donald your letter of November 25 respecting this article.\r\n\r\n\"The Commercial Committee have formed a new tariff, which is now under\r\npress, as they write me, to be presented to the assembly. They not only\r\nadmit American oils in their plan, but put the duties lower than under the\r\n_Arrêt du Conseil_. It is yet for the assembly to decide on it. I have\r\nalready informed you of the stages through which this business has been\r\ncarried, and the manner in which it has been done. I hope the means will\r\nbe approved of; and the United States will have reason to be satisfied\r\nwith the result. The delay is inevitable from the nature and proceedings\r\nof the assembly. That is the cause, also, of the uncertainty and variation\r\nin the opinions which I have communicated to you from time to time on\r\nthese subjects.\r\n\r\n\"The resistance of a considerable part of the clergy to a decree of the\r\nassembly for their civil organization, and particularly for changing the\r\nlimits of the dioceses, and the violent measures adopted by the assembly\r\nrespecting this resistance, or rather non-compliance, has been matter of\r\nuneasiness for some time. By a decree of the assembly all those of the\r\nclergy who, by a given day, had not taken an oath to maintain the civil\r\norganization of that body, were to be deprived of their ecclesiastical\r\nfunctions, and their successors immediately appointed agreeably to the\r\nnew mode of election. That day rigorously has passed, and only two bishops\r\nof the assembly have taken the oath. Of the curates of Paris a majority,\r\nalso, had refused; but among those subscribed were some of the principal,\r\nand particularly the curate of St. Eustache, the King's confessor, who,\r\nit is said, was converted by the King himself, who takes every possible\r\nmeans of preventing what might occasion disorder, and who, from his\r\nuniform conduct, merits better treatment than he sometimes receives. By a\r\nconstruction of the decree some delay is obtained for its execution. In\r\nthe meantime two of the refusing bishops have entered into negotiation.\r\nThey desire to find some decent means of retracting their refusal;\r\nhitherto they have waited for the consent of the Pope, to obtain which\r\nthey had sent an express to Rome. His answer has not yet been received,\r\nbut it is known by private letters that he is disposed to accommodate\r\nat present, though he would not hear of it at first. I know not yet what\r\neffect this will produce on the people in the provinces. In the capital,\r\ntheir love of the Revolution so far surpasses every other passion, that\r\nall the exertions of the _Garde Nationale_ have been necessary to prevent\r\ntheir entering the churches and hanging the refusing curates. They will\r\nmanifest their dispositions less violently, perhaps, in the provinces, but\r\nin general the spirit of the Revolution will certainly predominate, even\r\nif the clergy succeed to convince them that it is contrary to the spirit\r\nof religion.\r\n\r\n\"The funds have risen to an uncommon height owing to the considerable\r\nreimbursements made by the emission of _assignats_. These do not\r\ndepreciate as might have been expected. On the whole, if there were any\r\nprobability of the assembly's confining themselves merely to the business\r\nof organizing the government, so as to put an end to their session and\r\ncall a new legislature, the Revolution might be considered as really in a\r\nsuccessful state; but the Report of the Central Committee, which you will\r\nhave received, prescribes such a superabundance of matter as necessary\r\nto be deliberated on and settled by the present assembly, that its end\r\nas well as the term of the completion of the constitution can be reduced\r\nto no calculation. All that seems to me certain is, that the Revolution\r\nwill in one way or another end by giving a free government to France. This\r\nevent might be hastened much by the assembly, if they would. My former\r\nletters will have informed you how little I think it is to be hoped from\r\nthem, and for what reasons.\r\n\r\n\"The Russians, as has been expected for some time, have taken Ismailow.\r\nThey stormed it, and put the whole garrison to the sword on the 22d of\r\nDecember. This was probably to strike terror into the Turks, in order\r\nto aid the separate negotiation which it is known Prince Potemkin is\r\nendeavoring to effect with the Grand Visier. The object is to engage\r\nthe Porte to accept peace without the mediation of other powers. On\r\nthe other hand, Prussia is active both in negotiation and military\r\ndemonstration to counteract this project. Preparations are making for\r\nsending a large army into Livonia in the spring, which has induced the\r\nEmpress to call off some of the heavy troops from those employed against\r\nthe Turks. England, also, keeps an augmented navy in commission. It\r\nseems not doubted that the design is to send a fleet into the Baltic\r\nas soon as the season will permit it. It is said, also, that the three\r\nmediating powers are negotiating with Denmark, to engage that country\r\nto be at least indifferent as to the entrance of this fleet; and that\r\nthere are grounds for hopes of success. Some think, also, that there\r\nare indications which render it probable that Spain will join in the\r\nmediation for obtaining peace for the Turks. I have no reason to suppose\r\nit other than that arising from the desire which Spain must naturally have\r\nto see peace restored to that power. It is supposed if she joins in the\r\nmediation it will be merely for that object, and not from any disposition\r\nto favor generally the system of the mediating powers. Where so many\r\nand such opposite principles enter into account, it would be temerity to\r\nconjecture the particular results, without being behind the curtain; and\r\neven there probably the schemes are not yet fully ascertained. Every day\r\nmust necessarily throw new lights on this complicated state of affairs,\r\nin proportion as the state of negotiation is more advanced.\r\n\r\n\"I think it probable myself, that peace will be effected one way or\r\nanother in the course of the year. The present favorable situation of the\r\nRussian army, the dispersed and disheartened situation of the Ottoman, the\r\nsuccor promised by Prussia, so long deferred, the little hope of immediate\r\nrelief from the geographical position of that power, the ardent desire\r\nof Russia to effect a peace without mediation, and the sacrifices she is\r\ndisposed to make to effect it; all induce me to believe that it will be\r\nbrought about in that way. If, however, the Porte, from a well-founded\r\nconfidence in the active interference of the mediating powers, should\r\ndecide still to hold out, then it seems that the Empress will be induced\r\nto come to terms rather than enter the lists with new and powerful\r\nenemies, from whom she would have much to fear, particularly by sea.\r\nStill I find several who think, from the character of the Empress, that\r\nshe will resist, and try the event of a campaign rather than sacrifice\r\nso much success and so much glory in having a peace dictated to her.\r\nHer resources at home are without end from her mode of calling them into\r\naction, and her credit, even here, stands high; certainly much higher than\r\nit should do. It is supposed, also, that in this extremity she would be\r\nseconded by the Emperor, notwithstanding his pacific turn. He would be\r\nauthorized by treaty to do this, and his present situation would enable\r\nhim; the disturbances in the various parts of his dominions having been\r\nall settled. In Brabant, particularly, his authority is more firmly\r\nsettled than if he had come to it by inheritance only, since he enjoys it\r\nalso by a kind of conquest.\r\n\r\n\"It is the system of the English Cabinet which is considered here as the\r\nmost unaccountable. The commerce of that country is at present in the\r\nmost prosperous situation, since the balance is in their favor with every\r\npart of Europe. They have more to gain by peace and more to apprehend\r\nfrom war, than any other power, and yet they seem determined to risk it.\r\nThe advantages of their commerce in the Baltic, are certain: those in the\r\nLevant, eventual; still they seem determined to sacrifice one, at least\r\nfor a time, in order to grasp at the other. On the whole, it is regarded\r\nas one of those sacrifices of commerce to politics, which France has so\r\noften given examples of. Time will show whether Mr. Pitt, or those who\r\ncondemn him, are in the right.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, April 11, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I wrote you on the 12th of March, and again on the 17th of the\r\nsame month; since which, I have received your favor of January the\r\n24th, wherein you refer to copies of two letters, also to a paper No. 1,\r\nsupposed to be enclosed in that letter; but there was nothing enclosed.\r\nYou speak particularly of several other letters formerly forwarded, but\r\nnot a single one was ever received of later date than May the 6th, 1789;\r\nand this of January 24th, is all we possess from you since that date.\r\nI enclose you a list of letters addressed to you on various subjects,\r\nand to which answers were and are naturally expected; and send you again\r\ncopies of the papers in the case of the Dover Cutter, which has been the\r\nsubject of so many of those letters, and is the subject of the constant\r\nsolicitation of the parties here. A final decision on that application,\r\ntherefore, is earnestly desired. When you consider the repeated references\r\nof matters to you from hence, and the total suppression of whatever you\r\nhave written in answer, you will not be surprised if it had excited a\r\ngreat degree of uneasiness. We had inquired whether private conveyances\r\ndid not occur, from time to time, from Madrid to Cadiz, where we have\r\nvessels almost constantly, and we were assured that such conveyances were\r\nfrequent. On the whole, Sir, you will be sensible, that under the jealous\r\ngovernment with which you reside, the conveyance of intelligence requires\r\nas much management as the obtaining it; and I am in hopes that in future,\r\nyou will be on your guard against those infidelities in that line, under\r\nwhich you and we have so much suffered.\r\n\r\nThe President is absent on a journey through the southern States, from\r\nwhich he will not return till the end of June; consequently, I could not\r\nsooner notify him of your desire to return; but even then, I will take\r\nthe liberty of saying nothing to him on the subject till I hear further\r\nfrom you. The suppression of your correspondence has, in a considerable\r\ndegree, withdrawn you from the public sight. I sincerely wish that before\r\nyour return, you could do something to attract their attention and favor,\r\nand render your return pleasing to yourself and profitable to them, by\r\nintroducing you to new proofs of their confidence. My two last letters\r\nto you furnish occasions; that of a co-operation against the British\r\nnavigation act and the arrangement of our affairs on the Mississippi.\r\nThe former, if it can be effected, will form a remarkable and memorable\r\nepoch in the history and freedom of the ocean. Mr. Short will press it\r\nat Paris, and Colonel Humphreys at Lisbon. The latter will show most at\r\nfirst; and as to it, be so good as to observe always, that the right of\r\nnavigating the Mississippi is considered as so palpable, that the recovery\r\nof it will produce no other sensation than that of a gross injustice\r\nremoved. The extent and freedom of the port for facilitating the use of\r\nit, is what will excite the attention and gratification of the public.\r\nColonel Humphreys writes me, that all Mr. Gardoqui's communications,\r\nwhile here, tended to impress the court of Madrid with the idea, that the\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi was only demanded on our part to quiet our\r\nwestern settlers, and that it was not sincerely desired by the maritime\r\nStates. This is a most fatal error, and must be completely eradicated and\r\nspeedily, or Mr. Gardoqui will prove to have been a bad peacemaker. It is\r\ntrue, there were characters whose stations entitled them to credit, and\r\nwho, from geographical prejudices, did not themselves wish the navigation\r\nof the Mississippi to be restored to us, and who believe, perhaps, as is\r\ncommon with mankind, that their opinion was the general opinion. But the\r\nsentiments of the great mass of the Union were decidedly otherwise then,\r\nand the very persons to whom Mr. Gardoqui alluded, have now come over to\r\nthe opinion heartily, that the navigation of the Mississippi, in full and\r\nunrestrained freedom, is indispensably necessary, and must be obtained\r\nby any means it may call for. It will be most unfortunate, indeed, if we\r\ncannot convince Spain that we make this demand in earnest, but by acts\r\nwhich will render that conviction too late to prevent evil.\r\n\r\nNot knowing how better to convey to you the laws and the gazettes, than by\r\ncommitting them to the patronage of Colonel Humphreys, I now send through\r\nthat channel the laws of the second and third sessions of Congress, and\r\nthe newspapers.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO C. CARROLL OF CARROLLTON.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, April 15, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I received last night your favor of the 10th, with Mr. Brown's\r\nreceipt, and thank you for the trouble you have been so kind as to take\r\nin this business.\r\n\r\nOur news from the westward is disagreeable. Constant murders committing\r\nby the Indians, and their combination threatens to be more and more\r\nextensive. I hope we shall give them a thorough drubbing this summer,\r\nand then change our tomahawk into a golden chain of friendship. The most\r\neconomical as well as most humane conduct towards them is to bribe them\r\ninto peace, and to retain them in peace by eternal bribes. The expedition\r\nthis year would have served for presents on the most liberal scale for\r\none hundred years; nor shall we otherwise ever get rid of an army, or of\r\nour debt. The least rag of Indian depredation will be an excuse to raise\r\ntroops for those who love to have troops, and for those who think that a\r\npublic debt is a good thing. Adieu, my dear Sir. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, April 17, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I had the honor of addressing you on the 2d, which I supposed\r\nwould find you at Richmond, and again on the 10th, which I thought\r\nwould overtake you at Wilmington. The present will probably find you at\r\nCharleston.\r\n\r\nAccording to what I mentioned in my letter of the 10th, the\r\nVice-President, Secretaries of the Treasury and War, and myself, met on\r\nthe 11th. Colonel Hamilton presented a letter from Mr. Short, in which\r\nhe mentioned that the month of February being one of the periodical\r\nmonths in Amsterdam, when, from the receipt of interest and refunding of\r\ncapitals, there is much money coming in there, and free to be disposed\r\nof, he had put off the opening his loan till then, that it might fill\r\nthe more rapidly, a circumstance which would excite the presumption\r\nof our credit;--that he had every reason to hope it would be filled\r\nbefore it would be possible for him, after his then communication of the\r\nconditions, to receive your approbation of them, and orders to open a\r\nsecond; which, however, should be awaited, according to his instructions;\r\nbut he pressed the expediting the order, that the stoppage of the current\r\nin our favor might be as short as possible. We saw that if, under present\r\ncircumstances, your orders should be awaited, it would add a month to\r\nthe delay, and we were satisfied, were you present, you would approve\r\nthe conditions, and order a second loan to be opened. We unanimously,\r\ntherefore, advised an immediate order, on condition the terms of the\r\nsecond loan should not be worse than those of the first.\r\n\r\nGeneral Knox expressed an apprehension that the Six Nations might be\r\ninduced to join our enemies, there being some suspicious circumstances;\r\nand he wished to send Colonel Pickering to confirm them in their\r\nneutrality. This, he observed, would occasion an expense of about two\r\nthousand dollars, as the Indians were never to be met empty handed. We\r\nthought the mission advisable. As to myself, I hope we shall give the\r\nIndians a thorough drubbing this summer, and I should think it better\r\nafterwards to take up the plan of liberal and repeated presents to them.\r\nThis would be much the cheapest in the end, and would save all the blood\r\nwhich is now spilt: in time, too, it would produce a spirit of peace and\r\nfriendship between us. The expense of a single expedition would last very\r\nlong for presents. I mentioned to the gentlemen, the idea of suggesting\r\nthrough Colonel Beckwith our knowledge of the conduct of the British\r\nofficers in furnishing the Indians with arms and ammunition, and our\r\ndissatisfaction. Colonel Hamilton said that Beckwith had been with him on\r\nthe subject, and had assured him they had given them nothing more than the\r\nannual presents, and at the annual period. It was thought proper, however,\r\nthat he should be made sensible that this had attracted the notice of\r\ngovernment. I thought it the more material, lest, having been himself the\r\nfirst to speak of it, he might suppose his excuses satisfactory, and that\r\ntherefore they might repeat the annual present this year. As Beckwith\r\nlodges in the same house with Mr. Madison, I have desired the latter to\r\nfind some occasion of representing to Beckwith that, though an annual\r\npresent of arms and ammunition be an innocent thing in time of peace, it\r\nis not so in time of war; that it is contrary to the laws of neutrality\r\nfor a neutral power to furnish military implements to either party at war,\r\nand that if their subjects should do it on private account, such furniture\r\nmight be seized as contraband: to reason with him on the subject, as from\r\nhimself, but so as to let him see that government thought as himself did.\r\n\r\nYou knew, I think, before you left us, that the British Parliament had a\r\nbill before them for allowing wheat, imported in _British_ bottoms, to\r\nbe warehoused rent free. In order further to circumscribe the carrying\r\nbusiness of the United States, they now refuse to consider as an American\r\nbottom any vessel not built here. By this construction, they take from\r\nus the right of defining, by our own laws, what vessels shall be deemed\r\nours and naturalized here; and in the event of a war, in which we should\r\nbe neutral, they put it out of our power to benefit ourselves of our\r\nneutrality, by increasing suddenly by purchase and naturalization our\r\nmeans of carriage. If we are permitted to do this by building only, the\r\nwar will be over before we can be prepared to take advantage of it. This\r\nhas been decided by the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, in the case\r\nof one Green, a merchant of New York; from whom I have received a regular\r\ncomplaint on the subject. I enclose you the copy of a note from Mr.\r\nKing to Colonel Hamilton, on the subject of the appointment of a British\r\nminister to come here. I suspect it, however, to be without foundation.\r\n\r\nColonel Eveleigh died yesterday. Supposing it possible you might desire to\r\nappoint his successor as soon as you could decide on one, I enclose you a\r\nblank commission; which, when you shall be pleased to fill it up and sign,\r\ncan be returned for the seal and counter-signature. I enclose you a letter\r\nfrom Mr. Coxe to yourself, on the subject of this appointment, and so much\r\nof one to me as related to the same, having torn off a leaf of compliment\r\nto lighten and lessen my enclosures to you. Should distributive justice\r\ngive preference to a successor of the same state with the deceased, I take\r\nthe liberty of suggesting to you Mr. Hayward, of South Carolina, whom I\r\nthink you told me you did not know, and of whom you are now on the spot of\r\ninquiry. I enclose you also a continuation of the Pennsylvania debates on\r\nthe bill for federal buildings. After the postponement by the Senate, it\r\nwas intended to bring on the reconsideration of that vote; but the hurry\r\nat winding up their session prevented it. They have not chosen a federal\r\nSenator.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most profound respect and sincere\r\nattachment, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, April 24, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I had the honor of addressing you on the 17th. Since which I have\r\nreceived yours of the 13th. I enclose you extracts from letters received\r\nfrom Mr. Short. In one of the 7th of February, Mr. Short informs me that\r\nhe has received a letter from M. de Montmorin, announcing to him that the\r\nKing has named Ternant his minister here. The questions on our tobacco and\r\noil have taken unfavorable turns. The former will pay fifty livres the\r\nthousand weight less, when carried in French than foreign bottoms. Oil\r\nis to pay twelve livres a kental, which amounts to a prohibition of the\r\ncommon oils, the only kind carried there. Tobacco will not feel the effect\r\nof these measures till time will be given to bring it to rights. They had\r\nonly twenty thousand hogsheads in the kingdom in November last, and they\r\nconsume two thousand hogsheads a month, so that they must immediately\r\ncome forward and make great purchases, and not having as yet vessels of\r\ntheir own to carry it, they must pay the extra duties on ours. I have been\r\npuzzled about the delays required by Mr. Barclay's affairs. He gives me\r\nreason to be tolerably assured, that he will go in the first vessel which\r\nshall sail after the last day of May. There is no vessel at present whose\r\ndestination would suit. Believing that even with this, we shall get the\r\nbusiness done sooner than through any other channel, I have thought it\r\nbest not to change the plan. The last Leyden gazettes give us what would\r\nhave been the first object of the British arms, had the rupture with Spain\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\nYou know that Admiral Cornish had sailed on an unknown destination before\r\nthe Convention was received in London. Immediately on its receipt, they\r\nsent an express after him to Madeira, in hopes of finding him there.\r\nHe was gone, and had so short a passage, that in twenty-three days he\r\nhad arrived in Barbadoes, the general rendezvous. All the troops of the\r\nislands were collecting there, and General Matthews was on his way from\r\nAntigua to take command of the land operations, when he met with the\r\npacket-boat which carried the counter-orders. Trinidad was the object of\r\nthe expedition. Matthews returned to Antigua, and Cornish is arrived in\r\nEngland. This island, at the mouth of the Oronoko, is admirably suited for\r\na lodgment from which all the country up that river, and all the northern\r\ncoast of South America, Spanish, French, Dutch and Portuguese, may be\r\nsuddenly assailed.\r\n\r\nColonel Pickering is now here, and will set out in two or three days to\r\nmeet the Indians, as mentioned in my last. The intimation to Colonel\r\nBeckwith has been given by Mr. Madison. He met it on very different\r\ngrounds from that on which he had placed it with Colonel Hamilton. He\r\npretended ignorance and even disbelief of the fact; when told that it was\r\nout of doubt, he said he was positively sure the distribution of arms had\r\nbeen without the knowledge and against the orders of Lord Dorchester,\r\nand of the government. He endeavored to induce a formal communication\r\nfrom me. When he found that could not be effected, he let Mr. Madison\r\nperceive that he thought, however informal his character, he had not\r\nbeen sufficiently noticed; said he was in New York before I came into\r\noffice, and that though he had not been regularly turned over to me, yet\r\nI knew his character. In fine, he promised to write to Lord Dorchester\r\nthe general information we had received, and our sense of it; and he saw\r\nthat his former apologies to Colonel Hamilton had not been satisfactory\r\nto the government. Nothing further from Moose Island, nor the posts on\r\nthe northern border of New York, nor anything of the last week from the\r\nwestern country.\r\n\r\nArthur Campbell has been here. He is the enemy of P. Henry. He says the\r\nYazoo bargain is like to drop with the consent of the purchasers. He\r\nexplains it thus: They expected to pay for the lands in public paper at\r\npar, which they had bought at half a crown a pound. Since the rise in\r\nthe value of the public paper, they have gained as much on that as they\r\nwould have done by investing it in the Yazoo lands; perhaps more, as it\r\nputs a large sum of specie at their command, which they can turn to better\r\naccount. They are, therefore, likely to acquiesce under the determination\r\nof the government of Georgia to consider the contract as forfeited by\r\nnon-payment.\r\n\r\nI direct this letter to be forwarded from Charleston to Cambden. The next\r\nwill be from Petersburg to Taylor's Ferry; and after that, I shall direct\r\nto you at Mount Vernon.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most affectionate respect\r\nand attachment, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, April 25, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--My late letters to you have been of the 8th, 12th, 15th, and\r\n19th of March, yours received and acknowledged are as follows.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI consider the consular convention as securing clearly our right to\r\nappoint consuls in the French colonies. The words \"Etats du roi,\"\r\nunquestionably extend to all his dominions. If they had been merely\r\nsynonymous with \"la France,\" why was the alteration made? When I proposed\r\nthat alteration, I explained my reasons, and it cannot be supposed I would\r\nsuffer a change of language but for some matter of substance. Again,\r\nin the translation, it is \"dominions of France.\" This translation was\r\nsubmitted to M. de Montmorin and M. de Reyneval, with a request that they\r\nwould note any deviation in it from the original, or otherwise it would\r\nbe considered as faithful. No part was objected to. M. de Reyneval says,\r\nwe must decide by the instrument itself, and not by the explanations\r\nwhich took place. It is a rule, where expressions are susceptible of two\r\nmeanings, to recur to other explanations. Good faith is in favor of this\r\nrecurrence. However, in the present case, the expression does not admit\r\nof two constructions; it is co-extensive with the dominions of the King.\r\nI insist on this, only as a reservation of our right, and not with a\r\nview to exercise it, if it shall be inconvenient and disagreeable to the\r\ngovernment of France. Only two appointments have as yet been made (Mr.\r\nSkipwith at Martinique and Guadaloupe, and Mr. Bourne in St. Dominique),\r\nand they shall be instructed not to ask a regular Exequatur. We certainly\r\nwish to press nothing on our friends which shall be inconvenient. I\r\nshall hope that M. de Montmorin will order such attentions to be shown to\r\nthose gentlemen as the patronage of commerce may call for, and may not\r\nbe inconvenient to the government. These gentlemen are most pointedly\r\ninstructed not to intermeddle, by word or deed, with political matters.\r\n\r\nMy letter of August, 1790, to Mr. Carmichael, was delivered to him by\r\nColonel Humphreys.\r\n\r\nThe report you mention of the prospect of our captives at Algiers\r\nbeing liberated, has not taken its rise from any authoritative source.\r\nUnfortunately for us, there have been so many persons, who (from friendly\r\nor charitable motives, or to recommend themselves) have busied themselves\r\nabout this redemption, as to excite great expectations in the captors, and\r\nrender our countrymen in fact irredeemable. We have not a single operation\r\non foot for that purpose, but what you know of, and the more all voluntary\r\ninterpositions are discouraged the better for our unhappy friends whom\r\nthey are meant to serve.\r\n\r\nYou know how strongly we desire to pay off our whole debt to France,\r\nand that for this purpose we will use our credit as far as it will hold\r\ngood. You know, also, what may be the probability of our being able to\r\nborrow the whole sum. Under these dispositions and prospects, it would\r\ngrieve us extremely to see our debt pass into the hands of speculators,\r\nand be subjected ourselves to the chicaneries and vexations of private\r\navarice. We desire you, therefore, to dissuade the government, as far as\r\nyou can prudently, from listening to any overtures of that kind, and as\r\nto the speculators themselves, whether native or foreign, to inform them,\r\nwithout reserve, that our government condemns their projects, and reserves\r\nto itself the right of paying no where but into the treasury of France,\r\naccording to their contract.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a copy of Mr. Grand's note to me, stating the conditions\r\non which Drost would come, and also a letter from the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, expressing his ideas as to those terms, with which I agree.\r\nWe leave to your agency the engaging and sending Mr. Drost as soon as\r\npossible, and to your discretion to fix the terms, rendering the allowance\r\nfor expenses certain, which his first proposition leaves uncertain.\r\nSubsistence here costs about one-third of what it does in Paris, to a\r\nhousekeeper. In a lodging house, the highest price for a room and board\r\nis a dollar a day, for the master, and half that for the servant. These\r\nfacts may enable you to settle the article of expenses reasonably. If Mr.\r\nDrost undertakes assaying, I should much rather confide it to him, than to\r\nany other person who can be sent. It is the most confidential operation\r\nin the whole business of coining. We should expect him to instruct a\r\nnative in it. I think, too, he should be obliged to continue longer than\r\na year, if it should be necessary for qualifying others to continue his\r\noperations. It is not important that he be here till November or December,\r\nbut extremely desirable then. He may come as much sooner as he pleases.\r\n\r\nWe address to M. la Motte a small box for you, containing a complete set\r\nof the journals of the ancient Congress, the acts of the last session of\r\nthe federal legislature, and a continuation of the newspapers. I am, with\r\ngreat and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your affectionate friend and humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                 Philadelphia, May 1, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I had the honor of addressing you on the 24th ult., which I presume\r\nyou will have received at Camden. The present is ordered to go from\r\nPetersburg to Taylor's ferry. I think it better my letters should be even\r\nsome days ahead of you, knowing that if they ever get into your rear they\r\nwill never overtake you. I write to-day, indeed, merely as the watchman\r\ncries, to prove himself awake, and that all is well, for the last week\r\nhas scarcely furnished anything foreign or domestic, worthy your notice.\r\nTruxton is arrived from the East Indies, and confirms the check by Tippoo\r\nSaib, on the detachment of Colonel Floyd, which consisted of between three\r\nand four thousand men. The latter lost most of his baggage and artillery,\r\nand retreated under the pursuit of the enemy. The loss of men is pretended\r\nby their own papers to have been two or three hundred only. But the loss\r\nand character of the officers killed, makes me suspect that the situation\r\nhas been such as to force the best officers to expose themselves the\r\nmost, and consequently that more men must have fallen. The main body\r\nwith General Meadows at their head are pretended to be going on boldly.\r\nYet, Lord Cornwallis is going to take the field in person. This shows\r\nthat affairs are in such a situation as to give anxiety. Upon the whole,\r\nthe account received through Paris papers proves true, notwithstanding\r\nthe minister had declared to the House of Commons, in his place, that\r\nthe public accounts were without foundation, and that nothing amiss had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nOur loan in Amsterdam for two and a half million of florins filled in two\r\nhours and a half after it was opened.\r\n\r\nThe Vice-President leaves us to-morrow. We are told that Mr. Morris gets\r\n£70,000 sterling for the lands he has sold.\r\n\r\nA Mr. Noble has been here, from the country where they are busied with the\r\nsugar-maple tree. He thinks Mr. Cooper will bring three thousand pounds\r\nworth to market this season, and gives the most flattering calculations of\r\nwhat may be done in that way. He informs me of another most satisfactory\r\nfact, that less profit is made by converting the juice into spirit than\r\ninto sugar. He gave me specimens of the spirit, which is exactly whiskey.\r\n\r\nI have arrived at Baltimore from Marseilles forty olive trees of the best\r\nkind from Marseilles, and a box of seed, the latter to raise stocks,\r\nand the former, cuttings to engraft on the stocks. I am ordering them\r\non instantly to Charleston, where, if they arrive in the course of this\r\nmonth, they will be in time. Another cargo is on its way from Bordeaux,\r\nso that I hope to secure the commencement of this culture, and from the\r\nbest species. Sugar and oil will be no mean addition to the articles of\r\nour culture. I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect and esteem,\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE ATTORNEY OF THE DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY.\r\n\r\n                                                 Philadelphia, May 7, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--A certain James O'Fallon is, as we are informed, undertaking\r\nto raise, organize and commission an army, of his own authority, and\r\nindependent of that of the government, the object of which is, to\r\ngo and possess themselves of lands which have never yet been granted\r\nby any authority, which the government admits to be legal, and with\r\nan avowed design to hold them by force against any power, foreign or\r\ndomestic. As this will inevitably commit our whole nation in war with\r\nthe Indian nations, and perhaps others, it cannot be permitted that all\r\nthe inhabitants of the United States shall be involved in the calamities\r\nof war, and the blood of thousands of them be poured out, merely that a\r\nfew adventurers may possess themselves of lands; nor can a well ordered\r\ngovernment tolerate such an assumption of its sovereignty by unauthorized\r\nindividuals. I send you herein the Attorney General's opinion of what\r\nmay legally be done, with a desire that you proceed against the said\r\nO'Fallon according to law. It is not the wish, to extend the prosecution\r\nto other individuals, who may have given thoughtlessly into his unlawful\r\nproceeding. I enclose you a proclamation to this effect. But they may be\r\nassured, that if this undertaking be prosecuted, the whole force of the\r\nUnited States will be displayed to punish the transgression. I enclose\r\nyou one of O'Fallon's commissions, signed, as is said, by himself.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                 Philadelphia, May 8, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--The last week does not furnish one single public event worthy\r\ncommunicating to you; so that I have only to say \"all is well.\" Paine's\r\nanswer to Burke's pamphlet begins to produce some squibs in our public\r\npapers. In Fenno's paper they are Burkites, in the others, Painites. One\r\nof Fenno's was evidently from the author of the discourses on Davila. I\r\nam afraid the indiscretion of a printer has committed me with my friend,\r\nMr. Adams, for whom, as one of the most honest and disinterested men\r\nalive, I have a cordial esteem, increased by long habits of concurrence in\r\nopinion in the days of his republicanism; and even since his apostacy to\r\nhereditary monarchy and nobility, though we differ, we differ as friends\r\nshould do. Beckley had the only copy of Paine's pamphlet, and lent it to\r\nme, desiring when I should have read it, that I would send it to a Mr. J.\r\nB. Smith, who had asked it for his brother to reprint it. Being an utter\r\nstranger to J. B. Smith, both by sight and character, I wrote a note to\r\nexplain to him why I (a stranger to him) sent him a pamphlet, to wit,\r\nthat Mr. Beckley had desired it; and to take off a little of the dryness\r\nof the note, I added that I was glad to find it was to be reprinted,\r\nthat something would, at length, be publicly said against the political\r\nheresies which had lately sprung up among us, and that I did not doubt\r\nour citizens would rally again round the standard of common sense. That\r\nI had in my view the discourses on Davila, which have filled Fenno's\r\npapers, for a twelvemonth, without contradiction, is certain, but nothing\r\nwas ever further from my thoughts than to become myself the contradictor\r\nbefore the public. To my great astonishment, however, when the pamphlet\r\ncame out, the printer had prefixed my note to it, without having given\r\nme the most distant hint of it. Mr. Adams will unquestionably take to\r\nhimself the charge of political heresy, as conscious of his own views of\r\ndrawing the present government to the form of the English constitution,\r\nand, I fear, will consider me as meaning to injure him in the public eye.\r\nI learn that some Anglo-men have censured it in another point of view,\r\nas a sanction of Paine's principles tends to give offence to the British\r\ngovernment. Their real fear, however, is that this popular and republican\r\npamphlet, taking wonderfully, is likely at a single stroke, to wipe out\r\nall the unconstitutional doctrines which their bell-weather Davila has\r\nbeen preaching for a twelvemonth. I certainly never made a secret of\r\nmy being anti-monarchical, and anti-aristocratical; but I am sincerely\r\nmortified to be thus brought forward on the public stage, where to remain,\r\nto advance or to retire, will be equally against my love of silence and\r\nquiet, and my abhorrence of dispute. I do not know whether you recollect\r\nthat the records of Virginia were destroyed by the British in the year\r\n1781. Particularly the transactions of the revolution before that time. I\r\nam collecting here all the letters I wrote to Congress while I was in the\r\nadministration there, and this being done, I shall then extend my views\r\nto my predecessors, in order to replace the whole in the public offices\r\nin Virginia. I think that during my administration, say between June 1,\r\n1779, and June 1, 1781, I had the honor of writing frequent letters to\r\nyou on public affairs, which perhaps, may be among your papers at Mount\r\nVernon. Would it be consistent with any general resolution you have formed\r\nas to your papers, to let my letters of the above period come here to be\r\ncopied, in order to make them a part of the records I am endeavoring to\r\nrestore for the State? or would their selection be too troublesome? if\r\nnot, I would beg the loan of them, under an assurance that they shall be\r\ntaken the utmost care of, and safely returned to their present deposit.\r\n\r\nThe quiet and regular movement of our political affairs leaves nothing to\r\nadd but constant prayers for your health and welfare, and assurances of\r\nthe sincere respect and attachment of, Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE JEREMIAH WADSWORTH.\r\n\r\n                                                Philadelphia, May 11, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have duly received your favor of April 20. The exemption from the\r\nDroit d'Aubaine in the French West Indies, has been for some time past\r\na subject of attention. As the National Assembly were abolishing it in\r\n_France_ for all nations, I desired our Chargé des Affaires there to see\r\nthat the decree should be extended to all the _dominions_ of France. His\r\nletters assure me that it will be done, so as to remove this grievance\r\nhereafter. With respect to the past, I believe it has been judiciously\r\ndetermined in France that the exemption given by our treaty did not\r\nextend to their foreign possessions. Should Mr. Johnston, however, be\r\ndisposed to try this matter, it will be requisite for him to obtain from\r\nPort-au-Prince an authenticated record of the proceedings in his case. It\r\nwould seem, also, that those in the case of the gentleman of Curraçoa,\r\nmight be useful. These should be transmitted to some person in Paris\r\nto solicit the government for him. Though it is not permitted that our\r\nChargé des Affaires there, or anywhere, should act as the private agent\r\nor solicitor for any individual, yet he will lend his aid and influence\r\nwherever it may be just and useful, by official applications. I have the\r\nhonor to be, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\n                                                Philadelphia, May 13, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--You will readily conceive that the union of domestic with the\r\nforeign affairs under the department of State, brings on the head of\r\nthis department such incessant calls, not admitting delay, as oblige\r\nhim to postpone whatever will bear postponing; hence, though it is\r\nimportant that I should continue to receive, from time to time, regular\r\ninformation from you of whatever occurs within your notice, interesting to\r\nthe United States, yet it is not in my power to acknowledge the receipt\r\nof your letters regularly as they come. I mention this circumstance\r\nthat you may ascribe the delay of acknowledgment to the real cause, and\r\nthat it may not produce any relaxation on your part in making all those\r\ncommunications which it is important should be received, and which govern\r\nour proceedings, though it is not in my power to note it to you specially.\r\n\r\nIn general, our affairs are proceeding in a train of unparalleled\r\nprosperity. This arises from the real improvements of our government,\r\nfrom the unbounded confidence reposed in it by the people, their zeal to\r\nsupport it, and their conviction that a solid Union is the best rock of\r\ntheir safety, from the favorable seasons which for some years past have\r\nco-operated with a fertile soil and a genial climate to increase the\r\nproductions of agriculture, and from the growth of industry, economy and\r\ndomestic manufactures; so that I believe I may say with truth, that there\r\nis not a nation under the sun enjoying more present prosperity, nor with\r\nmore in prospect. The Indians on our frontier, indeed, still continue\r\nto cut off straggling individuals or families falling in their way. An\r\nexpedition against them the last summer was less successful than there was\r\nreason to expect. We lost in it about one hundred men. The operations of\r\nthe present summer will more probably bring them to peace, which is all we\r\ndesire of them, it having been a leading object of our present Government\r\nto guaranty them in their present possessions, and to protect their\r\npersons with the same fidelity which is extended to its own citizens. We\r\nask nothing of them but that they will accept our peace, friendship and\r\nservices; and we hope soon to make them sensible of this, in spite of the\r\nincitements against us, which they have been so much the dupes of. This\r\nis the general state of our affairs at present, as faithfully as I am able\r\nto give it.\r\n\r\nI am to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of April 2, May 8, 17,\r\n26; July 10, 14; September 7, 30; October 19, November 23, December 6 and\r\n11. I now receive the Leyden Gazette with great regularity by the British\r\nPacket, and thank you for your attention to this, with a request that it\r\nmay be continued.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt it would be desirable for us to receive our intelligence\r\nfrom Europe through a channel of our own; but the expense of an\r\nestablishment of Packet-boats would be beyond the value of the object\r\nfor us, considering that our connection with Europe is less political\r\nthan commercial, and that information of the latter kind may come safely\r\nthrough any channel. In fact, if we attend to the whole amount of our\r\ncivil list, we shall find that the expense of Packet-boats would make a\r\nvery sensible addition to it. The idea, therefore, though good, must be\r\nsuspended yet awhile.\r\n\r\nAccept my thanks on the part of the Government for the copy of Rymer\r\nyou have been so good as to send us, and which is duly received, and be\r\nassured of the sincere esteem and attachment with which I have the honor\r\nto be, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS BARCLAY.\r\n\r\n                                                Philadelphia, May 13, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--You are appointed by the President of the United States, to go to\r\nthe court of Morocco, for the purpose of obtaining from the new Emperor, a\r\nrecognition of our treaty with his father. As it is thought best that you\r\nshould go in some definite character, that of consul has been adopted, and\r\nyou consequently receive a commission as consul for the United States, in\r\nthe dominions of the Emperor of Morocco, which, having been issued during\r\nthe recess of the Senate, will, of course, expire at the end of their next\r\nsession. It has been thought best, however, not to insert this limitation\r\nin the commission, as being unnecessary; and it might, perhaps, embarrass.\r\nBefore the end of the next session of the Senate, it is expected the\r\nobjects of your mission will be accomplished.\r\n\r\nLisbon being the most convenient port of correspondence between us and\r\nMorocco, sufficient authority will be given to Colonel Humphreys, resident\r\nof the United States at that place, over funds in Amsterdam, for the\r\nobjects of your mission. On him, therefore, you will draw for the sums\r\nherein allowed, or such parts of them as shall be necessary. To that\r\nport, too, you had better proceed in the first vessel which shall be\r\ngoing there, as it is expected you will get a ready passage from thence\r\nto Morocco.\r\n\r\nOn your arrival at Morocco, sound your ground, and know how things stand\r\nat present. Your former voyage there, having put you in possession of\r\nthe characters through whom this may be done, who may best be used for\r\napproaching the Emperor and effecting your purpose, you are left to use\r\nyour own knowledge to the best advantage.\r\n\r\nThe object being merely to obtain an acknowledgment of the treaty, we\r\nrely that you will be able to do this, giving very moderate presents.\r\nAs the amount of these will be drawn into precedent, on future similar\r\nrepetitions of them, it becomes important. Our distance, our seclusion\r\nfrom the ancient world, its politics and usages, our agricultural\r\noccupations and habits, our poverty, and lastly, our determination to\r\nprefer war in all cases, to tribute under any form, and to any people\r\nwhatever, will furnish you with topics for opposing and refusing high\r\nor dishonoring pretensions; to which may be added, the advantages their\r\npeople will derive from our commerce, and their sovereign, from the duties\r\nlaid on whatever we extract from that country.\r\n\r\nKeep us regularly informed of your proceedings and progress, by writing\r\nby every possible occasion, detailing to us particularly your conferences,\r\neither private or public, and the persons with whom they are held.\r\n\r\nWe think that Francisco Chiappe has merited well of the United States,\r\nby his care of their peace and interests. He has sent an account of\r\ndisbursements for us, amounting to three hundred and ninety-four dollars.\r\nDo not recognize the account, because we are unwilling, by doing that, to\r\ngive him a color for presenting larger ones hereafter, for expenses which\r\nit is impossible for us to scrutinize or control. Let him understand, that\r\nour laws oppose the application of public money so informally; but in your\r\npresents, treat _him_ handsomely, so as not only to cover this demand, but\r\ngo beyond it with a liberality which may fix him deeply in our interests.\r\nThe place he holds near the Emperor, renders his friendship peculiarly\r\nimportant. Let us have nothing further to do with his brothers, or any\r\nother person. The money which would make one good friend, divided among\r\nseveral, will produce no attachment.\r\n\r\nThe emperor has intimated that he expects an ambassador from us. Let him\r\nunderstand, that this may be a custom of the old world, but it is not\r\nours; that we never sent an ambassador to any nation.\r\n\r\nYou are to be allowed, from the day of your departure till your return,\r\none hundred and sixty-six dollars and sixty-six cents and two-thirds, a\r\nmonth, for your time and expenses, adding thereto your passage money and\r\nsea stores going and coming.\r\n\r\nRemain in your post till the 1st of April next, and as much longer as\r\nshall be necessary to accomplish the objects of your mission, unless you\r\nshould receive instructions from hence to the contrary.\r\n\r\nWith your commission, you will receive a letter to the Emperor of Morocco,\r\na cypher, and a letter to Colonel Humphreys.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n  _A private instruction which Mr. Barclay is to carry in his memory,\r\n  and not on paper, lest it should come into improper hands._\r\n\r\nWe rely that you will obtain the friendship of the new Emperor, and his\r\nassurances that the treaty shall be faithfully observed, with as little\r\nexpense as possible. But the sum of ten thousand dollars is fixed as\r\nthe limit which all your donations together are not to exceed.\r\n\r\nMay 13, 1791.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Letter from the President to the Emperor of Morocco, referred to in\r\nthe letter to Mr. Barclay._]\r\n\r\nGreat and Magnanimous Friend,--Separated by an immense ocean from the more\r\nancient nations of the earth, and little connected with their politics\r\nor proceedings, we are late in learning the events which take place among\r\nthem, and later in conveying to them our sentiments thereon.\r\n\r\nThe death of the late Emperor, your father and our friend, of glorious\r\nmemory, is one of those events which, though distant, attracts our\r\nnotice and concern. Receive, great and good friend, my sincere sympathy\r\nwith you on that loss; and permit me, at the same time, to express the\r\nsatisfaction with which I learn the accession of so worthy a successor to\r\nthe imperial throne of Morocco, and to offer you the homage of my sincere\r\ncongratulations. May the days of your Majesty's life be many and glorious,\r\nand may they ever mark the era during which a great people shall have been\r\nmost prosperous and happy, under the best and happiest of sovereigns!\r\n\r\nThe late Emperor, very soon after the establishment of our infant nation,\r\nmanifested his royal regard and amity to us by many friendly and generous\r\nacts, and, particularly, by the protection of our citizens in their\r\ncommerce with his subjects. And as a further instance of his desire to\r\npromote our prosperity and intercourse with his realms, he entered into a\r\ntreaty of amity and commerce with us, for himself and his successors, to\r\ncontinue fifty years. The justice and magnanimity of your Majesty, leave\r\nus full confidence that the treaty will meet your royal patronage also;\r\nand it will give me great satisfaction to be assured, that the citizens\r\nof the United States of America may expect from your imperial Majesty, the\r\nsame protection and kindness, which the example of your illustrious father\r\nhas taught them to expect from those who occupy the throne of Morocco,\r\nand to have your royal word, that they may count on a due observance of\r\nthe treaty which cements the two nations in friendship.\r\n\r\nThis will be delivered to your Majesty, by our faithful citizen, Thomas\r\nBarclay, whom I name consul for these United States in the dominions\r\nof your Majesty, and who, to the integrity and knowledge qualifying him\r\nfor that office, unites the peculiar advantage of having been the agent,\r\nthrough whom our treaty with the late Emperor was received. I pray your\r\nMajesty to protect him in the exercise of his functions for the patronage\r\nof the commerce between our two countries, and of those who carry it on.\r\n\r\nMay that God, whom we both adore, bless your imperial Majesty with long\r\nlife, health and success, and have you always, great and magnanimous\r\nfriend, under his holy keeping.\r\n\r\nWritten at Philadelphia, the thirty-first day of March, in the fifteenth\r\nyear of our sovereignty and independence, from your good and faithful\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ----.[4]\r\n                                      Bennington, in Vermont, June 5, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Mr. Madison and myself are so far on the tour we had projected.\r\nWe have visited, in the course of it, the principal scenes of General\r\nBurgoyne's misfortunes, to wit, the grounds at Stillwater, where the\r\naction of that name was fought, and particularly the breastworks, which\r\ncost so much blood to both parties, the encampments at Saratoga and\r\nground where the British piled their arms, and the field of the battle\r\nof Bennington, about nine miles from this place. We have also visited\r\nForts William, Henry and George, Ticonderoga, Crown Point, &c., which have\r\nbeen scenes of blood from a very early part of our history. We were more\r\npleased, however, with the botanical objects which continually presented\r\nthemselves. Those either unknown or rare in Virginia, were the sugar maple\r\nin vast abundance. The silver fir, white pine, pitch pine, spruce pine,\r\na shrub with decumbent stems, which they call juniper, an aralea, very\r\ndifferent from the nudiflora, with very large clusters of flowers, more\r\nthickly set on the branches, of a deeper red, and high pink-fragrance.\r\nIt is the richest shrub I have seen. The honey-suckle of the gardens\r\ngrowing wild on the banks of Lake George, the paper-birch, an aspen with\r\na velvet leaf, a shrub-willow with downy catkins, a wild gooseberry, the\r\nwild cherry with single fruit, (not the bunch cherry,) strawberries in\r\nabundance. From the highlands to the lakes it is a limestone country. It\r\nis in vast quantities on the eastern sides of the lakes, but none on the\r\nwestern sides. The Sandy Hill Falls and Wing's Falls, two very remarkable\r\ncataracts of the Hudson, of about thirty-five feet or forty feet each,\r\nbetween Fort Edward and Fort George, are of limestone, in horizontal\r\nstrata. Those of the Cohoes, on the west side of the Hudson, and of\r\nseventy feet height, we thought not of limestone. We have met with a small\r\nred squirrel, of the color of our fox-squirrel, with a black stripe on\r\neach side, weighing about six ounces generally, and in such abundance on\r\nLake Champlain particularly, as that twenty odd were killed at the house\r\nwe lodged in, opposite Crown Point, the morning we arrived there, without\r\ngoing ten yards from the door. We killed three crossing the lakes, one\r\nof them just as he was getting ashore, where it was three miles wide, and\r\nwhere, with the high wind then blowing, he must have made it five or six\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nI think I asked the favor of you to send for Anthony in the season for\r\ninoculation, as well as to do what is necessary in the orchard, as to\r\npursue the object of inoculating all the spontaneous cherry trees in the\r\nfields with good fruit.\r\n\r\nWe have now got over about four hundred miles of our tour, and have\r\nstill about four hundred and fifty more to go over. Arriving here on the\r\nSaturday evening, and the laws of the State not permitting us to travel on\r\nthe Sunday, has given me time to write to you from hence. I expect to be\r\nat Philadelphia by the 20th or 21st. I am, with great and sincere esteem,\r\ndear Sir, yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n     [4] [No address.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, July 10, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Your favor of June 17, has been duly received. I am endeavoring\r\nto get for you the lodgings Langdon had. But the landlord is doubtful\r\nwhether he will let them at all. If he will not, I will endeavor to do the\r\nbest I can. I can accommodate you myself with a stable and coach-house,\r\nwithout any expense, as I happen to have two on hand; and indeed, in my\r\nnew one, I have had stalls enough prepared for six horses, which are two\r\nmore than I keep. Of my success in procuring rooms, I shall bring you news\r\nmyself, though as yet the time of my visit to Albemarle is unfixed. Mr.\r\nMadison will both go and come with me. He is at present at New York. His\r\njourney with me to the lakes placed him in better health than I have seen\r\nhim; but the late heats have brought on some bilious dispositions.\r\n\r\nThe papers which I send Mr. Randolph weekly, and which I presume you see,\r\nwill have shown you what a dust Paine's pamphlet has kicked up here. My\r\nlast to Mr. Randolph will have given an explanation as to myself, which\r\nI had not time to give when I sent you the pamphlet. A writer, under the\r\nname of Publicola, in attacking all Paine's principles, is very desirous\r\nof involving me in the same censure with the author. I certainly merit\r\nthe same, for I profess the same principles; but it is equally certain I\r\nnever meant to have entered as a volunteer into the cause. My occupations\r\ndo not permit it. Some persons here are insinuating that I am Brutus, that\r\nI am Agricola, that I am Philodemus, &c., &c. I am none of them, being\r\ndecided not to write a word on the subject, unless any printed imputation\r\nshould call for a printed disavowal, to which I should put my name. A\r\nBoston paper has declared that Mr. Adams \"has no more concern in the\r\npublication of the writings of Publicola, than the author of the Rights\r\nof Man himself.\" If the equivoque here were not intended, the disavowal\r\nis not entirely credited, because not from Mr. Adams himself, and because\r\nthe style and sentiments raise so strong a presumption. Besides, to\r\nproduce any effect he must disavow Davila and the Defence of the American\r\nConstitutions. A host of writers have risen in favor of Paine, and prove\r\nthat in this quarter, at least, the spirit of republicanism is sound.\r\nThe contrary spirit of the high officers of government is more understood\r\nthan I expected. Colonel Hamilton avowing that he never made a secret of\r\nhis principles, yet taxes the imprudence of Mr. Adams in having stirred\r\nthe question, and agrees that \"his business is done.\" Jay, covering the\r\nsame principles under the veil of silence, is rising steadily on the\r\nruins of his friends. The bank filled and overflowed in the moment it\r\nwas opened. Instead of twenty thousand shares, twenty-four thousand were\r\noffered, and a great many unpresented, who had not suspected that so\r\nmuch haste was necessary. Thus it is that we shall be paying thirteen\r\nper cent. per annum for eight millions of paper money, instead of having\r\nthat circulation of gold and silver for nothing. Experience has proved to\r\nus that a dollar of silver disappears for every dollar of paper emitted;\r\nand, for the paper emitted from the bank, seven per cent. profits will\r\nbe received by the subscribers for it as bank paper, (according to the\r\nlast division of profits by the Philadelphia bank,) and six per cent.\r\non the public paper of which it is the representative. Nor is there any\r\nreason to believe, that either the six millions of paper, or the two\r\nmillions of specie deposited, will not be suffered to be withdrawn, and\r\nthe paper thrown into circulation. The cash deposited by strangers for\r\nsafe keeping will probably suffice for cash demands. Very few subscribers\r\nhave offered from Virginia or North Carolina, which gives uneasiness to\r\nH. It is impossible to say where the appetite for gambling will stop.\r\nThe land office, the federal town, certain schemes of manufacture, are\r\nall likely to be converted into aliment for that rage; but this subject\r\nis too copious for a letter, and must be reserved for conversation. The\r\nrespite from occupation which my journey procured, has entirely removed\r\nmy headaches. Kiss and bless Mrs. Monroe and Eliza, for, dear Sir, yours\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, July 13, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--Mr. Barclay having been detained longer than was expected, you will\r\nreceive this as well as my letter of May the 13th from him. Since the date\r\nof that, I have received your No. 15, March the 31st, No. 16, April the\r\n8th, No 17, April the 30th, No. 18, May the 3d, and No. 20, May the 21st.\r\n\r\nYou are not unacquainted with the situation of our captives at Algiers.\r\nMeasures were taken, and were long depending, for their redemption. During\r\nthe time of their dependence, we thought it would forward our success\r\nto take no notice of the captives. They were maintained by the Spanish\r\nconsul, from whom applications for reimbursement, through Mr. Carmichael,\r\noften came: no answer of any kind was ever given. A certainty now that our\r\nmeasures for their redemption will not succeed, renders it unnecessary\r\nfor us to be so reserved on the subject, and to continue to wear the\r\nappearance of neglecting them. Though the government might have agreed\r\nto ransom at the lowest price admitted with any nation (as, for instance,\r\nthat of the French order of Merci), they will not give anything like the\r\nprice which has been lately declared to be the lowest by the captors.\r\nIt remains, then, for us to see what other means are practicable for\r\ntheir recovery. In the meantime, it is our desire that the disbursements\r\nhitherto made for their subsistence, by the Spanish consul or others,\r\nbe paid off, and that their future comfortable subsistence be provided\r\nfor. As to past disbursements, I must beg the favor of you to write to\r\nMr. Carmichael, that you are authorized to pay them off, pray him to let\r\nyou know their amount, and to whom payments are due. With respect to\r\nfuture provision for the captives, I must put it into your hands. The\r\nimpossibility of getting letters to or from Mr. Carmichael, renders it\r\nimproper for us to use that channel. As to the footing on which they are\r\nto be subsisted, the ration and clothing of a soldier would have been\r\na good measure, were it possible to apply it to articles of food and\r\nclothing so extremely different as those used at Algiers. The allowance\r\nheretofore made them by the Spanish consul might perhaps furnish a better\r\nrule, as we have it from themselves, that they were then comfortably\r\nsubsisted. Should you be led to correspond with them at all, it had better\r\nbe with Captain O'Bryan, who is a sensible man, and whose conduct since\r\nhe has been there, has been particularly meritorious. It will be better\r\nfor you to avoid saying anything which may either increase or lessen their\r\nhopes of ransom. I write to our bankers, to answer your drafts for these\r\npurposes, and enclose you a duplicate to be forwarded with your first\r\ndraft. The prisoners are fourteen in number; their names and qualities as\r\nfollows: Richard O'Bryan and Isaac Stephens, captains; Andrew Montgomery\r\nand Alexander Forsyth, mates; Jacob Tessanier, a French passenger; William\r\nPatterson, Philip Sloan, Peleg Lorin, John Robertson, James Hall, James\r\nCathcart, George Smith, John Gregory, James Hermel, seamen. They have been\r\ntwenty-one or twenty-two.\r\n\r\nWe are in hourly expectation of hearing the event of General Scott's\r\nirruption into the Indian country, at the head of between seven and\r\neight hundred mounted infantry. Perhaps it may yet be known in time\r\nto communicate to you by this opportunity. Our bank was filled with\r\nsubscriptions the moment it was opened. Eight millions of dollars were the\r\nwhole permitted to be subscribed, of which two millions were deposited\r\nin cash, the residue to be public paper. Every other symptom is equally\r\nfavorable to our credit.\r\n\r\nThe President has returned from his southern tour in good health. You will\r\nreceive herewith the newspapers up to the present date. I have the honor\r\nto be, with great esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, July 17, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I have a dozen times taken up my pen to write to you, and as\r\noften laid it down again, suspended between opposing considerations. I\r\ndetermine, however, to write from a conviction that truth, between candid\r\nminds, can never do harm. The first of Paine's pamphlets on the rights of\r\nman, which came to hand here, belonged to Mr. Beckley. He lent it to Mr.\r\nMadison, who lent it to me; and while I was reading it, Mr. Beckley called\r\non me for it, and, as I had not finished it, he desired me, as soon as I\r\nshould have done so, to send it to Mr. Jonathan B. Smith, whose brother\r\nmeant to reprint it. I finished reading it, and, as I had no acquaintance\r\nwith Mr. Jonathan B. Smith, propriety required that I should explain\r\nto him why I, a stranger to him, sent him the pamphlet. I accordingly\r\nwrote a note of compliment, informing him that I did it at the desire\r\nof Mr. Beckley, and, to take off a little of the dryness of the note,\r\nI added that I was glad it was to be reprinted here, and that something\r\nwas to be publicly said against the political heresies which had sprung\r\nup among us, &c. I thought so little of this note, that I did not even\r\nkeep a copy of it; nor ever heard a tittle more of it, till, the week\r\nfollowing, I was thunderstruck with seeing it come out at the head of the\r\npamphlet. I hoped, however, it would not attract notice. But I found, on\r\nmy return from a journey of a month, that a writer came forward, under the\r\nsignature of Publicola, attacking not only the author and principles of\r\nthe pamphlet, but myself as its sponsor, by name. Soon after came hosts\r\nof other writers, defending the pamphlet, and attacking you, by name, as\r\nthe writer of Publicola. Thus were our names thrown on the public stage as\r\npublic antagonists. That you and I differ in our ideas of the best form\r\nof government, is well known to us both; but we have differed as friends\r\nshould do, respecting the purity of each other's motives, and confining\r\nour difference of opinion to private conversation. And I can declare with\r\ntruth, in the presence of the Almighty, that nothing was further from my\r\nintention or expectation than to have either my own or your name brought\r\nbefore the public on this occasion. The friendship and confidence which\r\nhas so long existed between us, required this explanation from me, and\r\nI know you too well to fear any misconstruction of the motives of it.\r\nSome people here, who would wish me to be, or to be thought, guilty of\r\nimproprieties, have suggested that I was Agricola, that I was Brutus,\r\n&c., &c. I never did in my life, either by myself or by any other, have\r\na sentence of mine inserted in a newspaper without putting my name to it;\r\nand I believe I never shall.\r\n\r\nWhile the Empress is refusing peace under a mediation, unless Ocrakow and\r\nits territory be ceded to her, she is offering peace on the perfect statu\r\nquo to the Porte, if they will conclude it without a mediation. France has\r\nstruck a severe blow at our navigation, by a difference of duty on tobacco\r\ncarried in our and their ships, and by taking from foreign-built ships\r\nthe capability of naturalization. She has placed our whale oil on rather\r\na better footing than ever, by consolidating the duties into a single one\r\nof six livres. They amounted before to some sous over that sum. I am told\r\n(I know not how truly), that England has prohibited our spermaceti oil\r\naltogether, and will prohibit our wheat till the price there is fifty-two\r\nshillings the quarter, which it almost never is. We expect hourly to hear\r\nthe true event of General Scott's expedition. Reports give favorable hopes\r\nof it. Be so good as to present my respectful compliments to Mrs. Adams,\r\nand to accept assurances of the sentiments of sincere esteem and respect\r\nwith which I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, July 26, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Your favors of February the 26th, and March the 16th, have\r\nbeen duly received. The conferences which you held last with the British\r\nminister needed no apology. At the time of writing my letter desiring that\r\ncommunications with them might cease, it was supposed possible that some\r\nmight take place before it would be received. They proved to be such as\r\nnot to vary the opinion formed, and, indeed, the result of the whole is\r\nwhat was to have been expected from known circumstances. Yet the essay\r\nwas perhaps necessary to justify, as well as induce, the measures proper\r\nfor the protection of our commerce. The first remittance of a thousand\r\ndollars to you, was made without the aid of any facts which could enable\r\nthe government to judge, what sum might be an indemnification for the\r\ninterference of the business referred to you, with your private pursuits.\r\nYour letter of February the 26th furnishing grounds for correcting the\r\nfirst judgment, I now enclose you a bill on our bankers in Holland for\r\nanother sum of a thousand dollars. In the original remittance, as in this\r\nsupplement to it, there has been no view but to do what is right between\r\nthe public and those who serve them.\r\n\r\nThough no authentic account is yet received, we learn through private\r\nchannels that General Scott has returned from a successful expedition\r\nagainst the Indians; having killed about thirty warriors, taken fifty odd\r\nwomen and children prisoners, and destroyed two or three villages, without\r\nthe loss of a man, except three, drowned by accident. A similar expedition\r\nwas to follow immediately after the first, while preparations are making\r\nfor measures of more permanent effect; so that we hope this summer to\r\nbring the Indians to accept of a just and general peace on which nothing\r\nwill be asked of them but their peace.\r\n\r\nThe crops of wheat in the United States are rather abundant, and the\r\nquality good. Those of tobacco are not promising as yet. I have heard\r\nnothing of the rice crops.\r\n\r\nI am, with very great esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, July 28, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Since my last I have received letters from you as follows:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMine to you, unacknowledged, were of March the 8th, 12th, 15th, 19th,\r\nApril the 25th, and May the 10th. Your two last letters mention the length\r\nof time you have been without intelligence, having then received mine of\r\nJanuary the 23d only. You will perceive by the above, that six letters\r\nof a later date were on their way to you. The receipt of these, with the\r\nnewspapers, journals, laws, and other printed papers accompanying them,\r\nwill have relieved your anxiety, by answering several articles of your\r\nformer letters, and opening to you some new and important matters. I\r\nscarcely ever miss the opportunity of a private vessel going from hence\r\nor New York to any port of France, without writing to you and sending you\r\nthe newspapers; &c. In the winter, occasions are very rare, this port,\r\nparticularly, being blocked up with ice. The reason of so long an interval\r\nbetween the last and present letter, has been the journey of a month,\r\nwhich that informed you I was about to take. This is the first vessel\r\nwhich has offered since my return; she is bound to Havre, and will carry\r\nthe newspapers as usual.\r\n\r\nThe difference of sixty-two livres ten sols the hogshead, established\r\nby the National Assembly on tobacco brought in their and our ships, is\r\nsuch an act of hostility against our navigation, as was not to have been\r\nexpected from the friendship of that nation. It is as new in its nature\r\nas extravagant in its degree; since it is unexampled, that any nation\r\nhas endeavored to wrest from another the carriage of its own produce,\r\nexcept in the case of their colonies. The British navigation act, so\r\nmuch and so justly complained of, leaves to all nations the carriage of\r\ntheir own commodities free. This measure, too, is calculated expressly to\r\ntake our own carriage from us and give the equivalent to other nations:\r\nfor it is well known, that the shipping of France is not equal to the\r\ncarriage of their whole commerce; but the freight in other branches of\r\nnavigation being on an equal footing with only forty livres the hogshead,\r\nin ours, and this new arrangement giving them sixty-two livres ten sols\r\nthe hogshead, in addition to their freight, that is to say, one hundred\r\nand two livres ten sols, instead of forty livres, their vessels will leave\r\nevery other branch of business to fill up this. They will consequently\r\nleave a void in those other branches, which will be occupied by English,\r\nDutch, and Swedes, on the spot. They complain of our tonnage duty; but it\r\nis because it is not understood. In the ports of France, we pay fees for\r\nanchorage, buoys and beacons, fees to measurers, weighers and gaugers, and\r\nin some countries, for light-houses. We have thought it better that the\r\npublic here should pay all these, and reimburse itself by a consolidation\r\nof them into one fee, proportioned to the tonnage of the vessel, and\r\ntherefore called by that name. They complain that the foreign tonnage is\r\nhigher than the domestic. If this complaint had come from the English,\r\nit would not have been wonderful, because the foreign tonnage operates\r\nreally as a tax on their commerce, which, under this name, is found to\r\npay sixteen dollars and fifty cents for every dollar paid by France. It\r\nwas not conceived, that the latter would have complained of a measure\r\ncalculated to operate so unequally on her rival, and I still suppose she\r\nwould not complain, if the thing were well understood. The refusing to\r\nour vessels the faculty of becoming national bottoms, on sale to their\r\ncitizens, was never before done by any nation but England. I cannot help\r\nhoping that these were wanderings of a moment, founded in misinformation,\r\nwhich reflection will have corrected before you receive this.\r\n\r\nWhenever jealousies are expressed as to any supposed views of ours, on\r\nthe dominion of the West Indies, you cannot go farther than the truth,\r\nin asserting we have none. If there be one principle more deeply rooted\r\nthan any other in the mind of every American, it is, that we should\r\nhave nothing to do with conquest. As to commerce, indeed, we have strong\r\nsensations. In casting our eyes over the earth, we see no instance of a\r\nnation forbidden, as we are, by foreign powers, to deal with neighbors,\r\nand obliged, with them, to carry into another hemisphere, the mutual\r\nsupplies necessary to relieve mutual wants. This is not merely a\r\nquestion between the foreign power and our neighbor. We are interested\r\nin it equally with the latter, and nothing but moderation, at least\r\nwith respect to us, can render us indifferent to its continuance. An\r\nexchange of surplusses and wants between neighbor nations, is both a\r\nright and a duty under the moral law, and measures against right should\r\nbe mollified in their exercise, if it be wished to lengthen them to the\r\ngreatest term possible. Circumstances sometimes require, that rights\r\nthe most unquestionable should be advanced with delicacy. It would seem\r\nthat the one now spoken of, would need only a mention, to be assented\r\nto by any unprejudiced mind: but with respect to America, Europeans\r\nin general, have been too long in the habit of confounding force with\r\nright. The Marquis de La Fayette stands in such a relation between the\r\ntwo countries, that I should think him perfectly capable of seeing what\r\nis just as to both. Perhaps on some occasion of free conversation, you\r\nmight find an opportunity of impressing these truths on his mind, and that\r\nfrom him, they might be let out at a proper moment as matters meriting\r\nconsideration and weight, when they shall be engaged in the work of\r\nforming a constitution for our neighbors. In policy, if not in justice,\r\nthey should be disposed to avoid oppression, which, falling on us, as well\r\nas on their colonies, might tempt us to act together.[5]\r\n\r\nThe element of measure adopted by the National Assembly excludes, _ipso\r\nfacto_, every nation on earth from a communion of measure with them; for\r\nthey acknowledge themselves, that a due portion for admeasurement of a\r\nmeridian crossing the forty-fifth degree of latitude, and terminating at\r\nboth ends in the same level, can be found in no other country on earth\r\nbut theirs. It would follow then, that other nations must trust to their\r\nadmeasurement, or send persons into their country to make it themselves,\r\nnot only in the first instance, but whenever afterwards they may wish to\r\nverify their measures. Instead of concurring, then, in a measure which,\r\nlike the pendulum, may be found in every point of the forty-fifth degree,\r\nand through both hemispheres, and consequently in all the countries of the\r\nearth lying under that parallel, either northern or southern, they adopt\r\none which can be found but in a single point of the northern parallel,\r\nand consequently only in one country, and that country is theirs.\r\n\r\nI left with you a statement of the case of Schweighauser and Dobrée,\r\nwith the original vouchers on which it depends. From these you will have\r\nknown, that being authorized by Congress to settle this matter, I began\r\nby offering to them an arbitration before honest and judicious men of a\r\nneutral nation. They declined this, and had the modesty to propose an\r\narbitration before _merchants of their own town_. I gave them warning\r\nthen, that as the offer on the part of a sovereign nation to submit to a\r\nprivate arbitration was an unusual condescendence, if they did not accept\r\nit then, it would not be repeated, and that the United States would judge\r\nthe case for themselves hereafter. They continued to decline it, and the\r\ncase now stands thus. The territorial judge of France has undertaken\r\nto call the United States to his jurisdiction, and has arrested their\r\nproperty, in order to enforce appearance, and possess himself of a matter\r\nwhereon to found a decree; but no court can have jurisdiction over a\r\nsovereign nation. This position was agreed to; but it was urged, that some\r\nact of Mr. Barclay's had admitted the jurisdiction. It was denied that\r\nthere had been any such act by Mr. Barclay, and disavowed, if there was\r\none, as without authority from the United States, the property on which\r\nthe arrest was made, having been purchased by Dr. Franklin, and remaining\r\nin his possession till taken out of it by the arrest. On this disavowal,\r\nit was agreed that there could be no further contest, and I received\r\nassurance that the property should be withdrawn from the possession of the\r\ncourt by an evocation of the cause before the King's Council, on which,\r\nwithout other proceedings, it should be delivered to the United States.\r\nApplications were repeated as often as dignity or even decency would\r\npermit; but it was never done. Thus the matter rests, and thus it is meant\r\nit should rest. No answer of any kind is to be given to Schweighauser and\r\nDobrée. If they think proper to apply to their sovereign, I presume there\r\nwill be a communication either through you or their representative here,\r\nand we shall have no difficulty to show the character of the treatment we\r\nhave experienced.\r\n\r\nI will observe for your information, that the sustenance of our captives\r\nat Algiers is committed to Colonel Humphreys.\r\n\r\nYou will be so kind as to remember, that your public account from the 1st\r\nday of July, 1790, to the last of June, 1791, inclusive, is desired before\r\nthe meeting of Congress, that I may be able to lay before them the general\r\naccount of the foreign fund for that year.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott has returned from a successful expedition against the\r\nnorthern Indians, having killed thirty-two warriors, taken fifty-eight\r\nwomen and children prisoners, and destroyed three towns and villages,\r\nwith a great deal of corn in grain and growth. A similar expedition was\r\nto follow immediately, while preparation is making for measures of more\r\npermanent effect; so that we may reasonably hope the Indians will be\r\ninduced to accept of peace which is all we desire.\r\n\r\nOur funds have risen nearly to par. The eight millions for the bank was\r\nsubscribed as fast as it could be written, and that stock is now above\r\npar. Our crops of wheat have been rather abundant, and of excellent\r\nquality. Those of tobacco are not very promising as yet. The census is not\r\nyet completed, but from what we hear, we may expect our whole numbers will\r\nbe nearer four than three millions. I inclose a sketch of the numbers as\r\nfar as we yet know them.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your sincere friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n     [5] [This paragraph was in cypher, but an explication of it preserved\r\n     with the copy.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PAINE.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, July 29, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Your favor of Sept. 28th, 1790, did not come to my hands till\r\nFeb. 11th, and I have not answered it sooner because it said you would\r\nbe here in the spring. That expectation being past, I now acknowledge the\r\nreceipt. Indeed I am glad you did not come away till you had written your\r\n\"Rights of Man.\" That has been much read here with avidity and pleasure.\r\nA writer under the signature of Publicola has attacked it. A host of\r\nchampions entered the arena immediately in your defence. The discussion\r\nexcited the public attention, recalled it to the \"Defence of the American\r\nconstitutions\" and the \"Discourses on Davila,\" which it had kindly passed\r\nover without censure in the moment, and very general expressions of their\r\nsense have been now drawn forth; and I thank God that they appear firm in\r\ntheir republicanism, notwithstanding the contrary hopes and assertions\r\nof a sect here, high in name but small in numbers. These had flattered\r\nthemselves that the silence of the people under the \"Defence\" and \"Davila\"\r\nwas a symptom of their conversion to the doctrine of king, lords, and\r\ncommons. They are checked at least by your pamphlet, and the people\r\nconfirmed in their good old faith.\r\n\r\nYour observations on the subject of a copper coinage has satisfied my mind\r\non that subject, which I confess had wavered before between difficulties.\r\nAs a different plan is under consideration of Congress, and will be taken\r\nup at their meeting, I think to watch the proper moment, and publish your\r\nobservations (except the notes which contain facts relative to particular\r\npersons, which I presume you would dislike to see published, and which are\r\nnot necessary to establish the main object), adding your name, because it\r\nwill attract attention and give weight to the publication. As this cannot\r\ntake place under four months, there is time for you to forbid me, if it\r\nshould be disagreeable to you to have the observations published, which,\r\nhowever, I hope it will not be.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott has just returned from a successful expedition against the\r\nIndians, having killed thirty-two warriors, and taken fifty-eight women\r\nand children, and burnt several towns. I hope they will now consent to\r\npeace, which is all we ask. Our funds are near par; the crops of wheat\r\nremarkably fine; and a great degree of general prosperity arising from\r\nfour years successive of plentiful crops, a great diffusion of domestic\r\nmanufacture, a return to economy, and a reasonable faith in the new\r\ngovernment. I shall be happy to hear from you, and still more to see you,\r\nbeing with great, and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, July 30, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have the honor to inclose for your perusal, a letter which I have\r\nprepared for Mr. Short.\r\n\r\nThe ill humor into which the French colonies are getting, and the little\r\ndependence on the troops sent thither, may produce a hesitation in\r\nthe National Assembly as to the conditions they will impose in their\r\nconstitution. In a moment of hesitation, small matters may influence their\r\ndecision. They may see the impolicy of insisting on particular conditions,\r\nwhich, operating as grievances on us, as well as on their colonists, might\r\nproduce a concert of action. I have thought it would not be amiss to trust\r\nto Mr. Short the sentiments in the cyphered part of the letter, leaving\r\nhim to govern himself by circumstances, whether to let them leak out at\r\nall or not, and whether so as that it may be known or remain unknown that\r\nthey come from us. A perfect knowledge of his judgment and discretion\r\nleaves me entirely satisfied, that they will be not used, or so used as\r\nevents shall render proper. But if you think that the possibility that\r\nharm may be done, overweighs the chance of good, I would expunge them,\r\nas, in cases of doubt, it is better to say too little than too much.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect respect and attachment, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL KNOX.\r\n\r\n                                             Philadelphia, August 10, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I have now the honor to return you the petition of Mr. Moultrie\r\non behalf of the South Carolina Yazoo company. Without noticing that some\r\nof the highest functions of sovereignty are assumed in the very papers\r\nwhich he annexes as his justification, I am of opinion that government\r\nshould firmly maintain this ground; that the Indians have a right to\r\nthe occupation of their lands, independent of the States within whose\r\nchartered lines they happen to be; that until they cede them by treaty\r\nor other transaction equivalent to a treaty, no act of a State can give\r\na right to such lands; that neither under the present constitution, nor\r\nthe antient confederation, had any State or person a right to treat with\r\nthe Indians, without the consent of the General Government; that that\r\nconsent has never been given to any treaty for the cession of the lands\r\nin question; that the government is determined to exert all its energy\r\nfor the patronage and protection of the rights of the Indians, and the\r\npreservation of peace between the United States and them; and that if any\r\nsettlements are made on lands not ceded by them, _without the previous\r\nconsent of the United States_, the government will think itself bound,\r\nnot only to declare to the Indians that such settlements are without the\r\nauthority or protection of the United States, but to remove them also by\r\nthe public force.\r\n\r\nIt is in compliance with your request, my dear Sir, that I submit these\r\nideas to you, to whom it belongs to give place to them, or such others as\r\nyour better judgment shall prefer, in answer to Mr. Moultrie.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most sincere and respectful\r\nesteem, dear Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HARVIE.\r\n\r\n                                             Philadelphia, August 14, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Being charged with the preparation of a statement to Congress\r\nof all their lands north of the Ohio, it becomes necessary for me to know\r\nwhat quantity of lands was assigned to the Virginia Continental line\r\non the south side of the Ohio, say on the Cumberland, in satisfaction\r\nof their claims of bounty lands against the Continent. If I can by any\r\nmeans come at this quantity, by deducting it from the sum total of bounty\r\nlands given to all the lines, which sum total I know, the residue will\r\nbe exactly what the army is entitled to on the north side of the Ohio.\r\nI am in hopes your office can furnish me with this information, and am\r\nto ask the favor of you to have it inquired into. All I wish is the _sum\r\ntotal_ in lots located by the Virginia _Continental line_ south of the\r\nOhio. I suppose your office cannot inform me what was located for the\r\nsame line north of the Ohio, and therefore I do not ask it. The fees\r\nof office for these researches, be so good as to inform me of, and they\r\nshall be remitted you. As your answer cannot be here before my departure\r\nfor Virginia, I shall be glad to receive it there. If your office cannot\r\nfurnish the information, and you know where it may be obtained, I shall\r\nconsider it as a singular favor, if you will be so good as to put it for\r\nme at once into its right channel. I am, with great esteem, dear Sir, your\r\nsincere friend and humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\n                                             Philadelphia, August 24, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--Your letter of January 24, is still the only one received from you\r\nwithin the period so often mentioned. Mine to you of the present year have\r\nbeen of March 12 and 17, April 11, May 16, and June 23. I have lately\r\npreferred sending my letters for you to Colonel Humphreys, in hopes he\r\nmight find means of conveying them to you. The subjects of those of the\r\n12th and 17th of March are still pressed on you, and especially the first,\r\nthe great object of which cannot be delayed without consequences which\r\nboth nations should deprecate.\r\n\r\nMr. Jaudenes arrived here some time ago, and has been received as joint\r\ncommissioner with Mr. Viar. The concurring interests of Spain and this\r\ncountry certainly require the presence of able and discreet ministers.\r\n\r\nThe crop of wheat of the present year has surpassed all expectation as\r\nto quantity, and is of fine quality. Other articles of agriculture will\r\ndiffer more by an extraordinary drought.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a copy of our census, which, so far as it is written\r\nin black ink, is founded on actual returns, what is in red ink being\r\nconjectured, but very near the truth. Making very small allowance for\r\nomissions, which we know to have been very great, we may safely say we\r\nare above four millions.\r\n\r\nOur first expedition against the Indians, under General Scott, has been\r\ncompletely successful; he having killed thirty odd, taken fifty odd, and\r\nburnt their towns. A second expedition against them has commenced, and we\r\nexpect daily the result.\r\n\r\nThe public credit continues firm. The domestic debt funded at six per\r\ncent., is twelve and a half per cent. above par. A spirit, however, of\r\ngambling in our public paper has seized on too many of our citizens, and\r\nwe fear it will check our commerce, arts, manufactures, and agriculture,\r\nunless stopped.\r\n\r\nNewspapers for you accompany this, addressed to the care of Colonel\r\nHumphreys.\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SIR JOHN SINCLAIR.\r\n\r\n                                             Philadelphia, August 24, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I am to acknowledge the receipt of your two favors of December\r\n25 and May 14, with the pamphlets which accompanied them, and to return\r\nyou my thanks for them. The Corn Law, I perceive, has not passed in the\r\nform you expected. My wishes on that subject were nearer yours than you\r\nimagined. We both in fact desired the same thing for different reasons,\r\nrespecting the interests of our respective countries, and therefore\r\njustifiable in both. You wished the bill so moulded as to encourage\r\nstrongly your national agriculture. The clause for warehousing foreign\r\ncorn tended to lessen the confidence of the farmer in the demand for\r\nhis corn. I wished the clause omitted, that our corn might pass directly\r\nto the country of the consumer, and save us the loss of an intermediate\r\ndeposit, which it can illy bear. That no commercial arrangements between\r\nGreat Britain and the United States have taken place, as you wish should\r\nbe done, cannot be imputed to us. The proposition has surely been often\r\nenough made, perhaps too often. It is a happy circumstance in human\r\naffairs, that evils which are not cured in one way will cure themselves\r\nin some other.\r\n\r\nWe are now under the first impression of the news of the King's flight\r\nfrom Paris, and his re-capture. It would be unfortunate were it in the\r\npower of any one man to defeat the issue of so beautiful a revolution.\r\nI hope and trust it is not, and that, for the good of suffering humanity\r\nall over the earth, that revolution will be established and spread through\r\nthe whole world.\r\n\r\nI shall always be happy, my dear Sir, to hear of your health and\r\nhappiness, being with sentiments of the most cordial esteem and respect,\r\ndear Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. RUTLEDGE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                             Philadelphia, August 25, 1791.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir,--I have received your favor of the 7th, by Mr. Harper, and\r\nthat also by Mr. Butler. I thank you for both, and shall duly respect\r\nboth. I find by the last that, not your letter on the subject of British\r\ncommerce, but mine in answer to it, has miscarried. Yours was dated June\r\n20, 1790, was received July 2, and answered July 4. I send you a copy of\r\nthe answer, which will read now like an old almanac; but it will show you\r\nI am incapable of neglecting anything which comes from you. The measures\r\ntherein spoken of as in contemplation, for the purpose of bringing Great\r\nBritain to reason, vanished in a reference of the subject to me to report\r\non our commerce and navigation generally, to the next session of Congress.\r\nI have little hope that the result will be anything more than to turn the\r\nleft cheek to him who has smitten the right. We have to encounter not\r\nonly the prejudices in favor of England, but those against the Eastern\r\nStates, whose ships, in the opinion of some, will overrun our land. I have\r\nbeen sorry to see that your State has been over-jealous of the measures\r\nproposed on this subject, and which really tend to relieve them from the\r\neffects of British broils. I wish you may be able to convert Mr. Barnwell,\r\nbecause you think him worth converting. Whether you do or not, your\r\nopinion of him will make me solicitous for his acquaintance, because I\r\nlove the good, and respect freedom of opinion. What do you think of this\r\nscrippomony? Ships are lying idle at the wharfs, buildings are stopped,\r\ncapitals withdrawn from commerce, manufactures, arts, and agriculture\r\nto be employed in gambling, and the tide of public prosperity almost\r\nunparalleled in any country is arrested in its course, and suppressed by\r\nthe rage of getting rich in a day. No mortal can tell where this will\r\nstop; for the spirit of gaming, when once it has seized a subject, is\r\nincurable. The tailor who has made thousands in one day, though he has\r\nlost them the next, can never again be content with the slow and moderate\r\nearnings of his needle. Nothing can exceed the public felicity, if our\r\npapers are to be believed, because our papers are under the orders of our\r\nscripmen. I imagine, however, we shall hear that all the cash has quitted\r\nthe extremities of the nation, and accumulated here. That produce and\r\nproperty fall to half price there, and the same things rise to double\r\nprice here. That the cash accumulated and stagnated here, as soon as\r\nthe bank paper gets out, will find its vent into foreign countries, and\r\ninstead of this solid medium, which we might have kept for nothing, we\r\nshall have a paper one, for the use of which we are to pay these gamesters\r\nfifteen per cent. per annum, as they say.\r\n\r\nWould to God yourself, General Pinckney and Major Pinckney, would come\r\nforward and aid us with your efforts. You are all known, respected, wished\r\nfor; but you refuse yourselves to everything. What is to become of us, my\r\ndear friend, if the vine and the fig tree withdraw, and leave us to the\r\nbramble and thorn?\r\n\r\nYou will have heard before this reaches you, of the peril into which the\r\nFrench revolution is brought by the flight of their King. Such are the\r\nfruits of that form of government, which heaps importance on idiots,\r\nand of which the Tories of the present day are trying to preach into\r\nour favor. I still hope the French revolution will issue happily. I feel\r\nthat the permanence of our own, leans in some degree on that; and that\r\na failure there would be a powerful argument to prove there must be a\r\nfailure here. We have been told that a British minister would be sent\r\nout to us this summer. I suspect this depends on the event of peace or\r\nwar. In the latter case, they will probably send one; but they have no\r\nserious view of treating or fulfilling treaties. Adieu, my dear Sir. Yours\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. JOHNSON, STUART, AND CARROL.\r\n\r\n                                             Philadelphia, August 28, 1791.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--Your joint letter of the 2d instant to the President, as\r\nalso Mr. Carrol's separate letters of the 5th and 15th, have been duly\r\nreceived. Major L'Enfant also having arrived here and laid his plan of the\r\nFederal City before the President, he was pleased to desire a conference\r\nof certain persons, in his presence, on these several subjects. It is\r\nthe opinion of the President, in consequence thereof, that an immediate\r\nmeeting of the Commissioners at Georgetown is requisite; that certain\r\nmeasures may be decided on, and put into a course of preparation for\r\na commencement of sale on the 17th of October, as advertised. As Mr.\r\nMadison and myself, who were present at the conference, propose to pass\r\nthrough Georgetown on our way to Virginia, the President supposes that\r\nour attendance at the meeting of the Commissioners might be of service\r\nto them, as we could communicate to them the sentiments developed at the\r\nconferences here and approved by the President, under whatever point of\r\nview they may have occasion to know them. The circumstances of time and\r\ndistance oblige me to take the liberty of proposing the day of meeting,\r\nand to say that we will be in Georgetown on the evening of the 7th or\r\nmorning of the 8th of the next month, in time to attend any meeting of the\r\nCommissioners on that day, and in hopes they may be able, in the course\r\nof it, to make all the use of us they may think proper, so that we may\r\npursue our journey the next day. To that meeting, therefore, the answers\r\nto the several letters before mentioned are referred.\r\n\r\nThis letter is addressed to Mr. Carrol only, with a requisition to the\r\nPostmaster at Georgetown to send it to him by express, under the hope that\r\nit will, by expresses to the other gentlemen, take timely measures for\r\nthe proposed meeting on the 8th.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect and esteem,\r\nGentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                             Philadelphia, August 29, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I am to acknowledge the receipt of your No. 67, June the 6th,\r\nNo. 68, June the 10th, No. 69, June the 22d, No. 70, June the 26th, No.\r\n71, June the 29th; the three last by the British packet. My last to you\r\nwas of July the 28th, by a vessel bound to Havre. This goes to the same\r\nport, because accompanied by newspapers. It will be the last I shall write\r\nyou these two months, as I am to set out for Virginia the next week. I\r\nnow enclose you a copy of my letter of March the 12th, to Mr. Carmichael,\r\nwhich you say was not in that of the same date to you. There was no paper\r\nto accompany it but St. Marie's, which you say you received. I enclose you\r\nalso a copy of our census, written in black ink, so far as we have actual\r\nreturns, and supplied by conjecture in red ink, where we have no returns;\r\nbut the conjectures are known to be very near the truth. Making very small\r\nallowance for omissions, which we know to have been very great, we are\r\ncertainly above four millions, probably about four millions one hundred\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nThere is a vessel now lying at Philadelphia, advertising to receive\r\nemigrants to Louisiana, gratis, on account of the Spanish government. Be\r\nso good as to mention this to M. de Montmorin, who will be a judge what\r\nwe must feel under so impudent a transaction.\r\n\r\nYou observe, that if Drost does not come, you have not been authorized to\r\nengage another coiner. If he does not come, there will probably be one\r\nengaged here. If he comes, I should think him a safe hand to send the\r\ndiplomatic dye by, as also all the dyes of our medal, which may be used\r\nhere for striking off what shall be wanting hereafter. But I would not\r\nhave them trusted at sea, but from April to October inclusive. Should you\r\nnot send them by Drost, Havre will be the best route. I have not spoken\r\nwith the Secretary of the Treasury yet, on the subject of the presses,\r\nbut believe you may safely consider two presses as sufficient for us, and\r\nagree for no more without a further request.\r\n\r\nThe decree of the National Assembly, relative to tobacco carried in\r\nFrench or American ships, is likely to have such an effect in our ports,\r\nas to render it impossible to conjecture what may or may not be done.\r\nIt is impossible to let it go on without a vigorous correction. If that\r\nshould be administered on our part, it will produce irritation on both\r\nsides, and lessen that disposition which we feel cordially to concur in\r\na treaty, which shall melt the two nations as to commercial matters into\r\none, as nearly as possible. It is extremely desirable, that the National\r\nAssembly should themselves correct the decree, by a repeal founded on the\r\nexpectation of an arrangement.\r\n\r\nWe have, as yet, no news of the event of our second expedition against\r\nthe Indians.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. LA MOTTE.\r\n\r\n                                             Philadelphia, August 30, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I am now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of February the\r\n9th, March the 25th, and April the 24th; as also of the several packages\r\nof wine, carriages, &c., which came safe to hand, and for your care of\r\nwhich be pleased to accept my thanks.\r\n\r\nI am sensible of the difficulties to which our consuls are exposed by\r\nthe applications of sailors, calling themselves Americans. Though the\r\ndifference of dialect between the Irish and Scotch, and the Americans, is\r\nsensible to the ear of a native, it is not to that of a foreigner, however\r\nwell he understands the language; and between the American and English\r\n(unless of particular provinces) there is no difference sensible even to a\r\nnative. Among hundreds of applications to me, at Paris, nine-tenths were\r\nIrish, whom I readily discovered. The residue, I think, were English;\r\nand I believe not a single instance of a Scotchman or American. The\r\nsobriety and order of the two last, preserve them from want. You will\r\nfind it necessary, therefore, to be extremely on your guard against\r\nthese applications. The bill of expenses for Huls is much beyond those\r\naids which I should think myself authorized to have advanced habitually,\r\nuntil the law shall make express provision for that purpose. I must,\r\ntherefore, recommend to you, to hazard only small sums in future, until\r\nour legislature shall lay down more precise rules for my government.\r\n\r\nThe difference of duty on tobacco carried to France in French and American\r\nbottoms, has excited great uneasiness. We presume the National Assembly\r\nmust have been hurried into the measure, without being allowed time to\r\nreflect on its consequences. A moment's consideration must convince\r\nanybody, that no nation upon earth ever submitted to so enormous an\r\nassault on the transportation of their own produce. Retaliation, to be\r\nequal, will have the air of extreme severity and hostility. Such would be\r\nan _additional tonnage_ of twelve livres ten sous the ton burthen, on all\r\n_French_ ships entering our ports. Yet this would but exactly balance an\r\n_additional duty_ of six livres five sous the hogshead of tobacco, brought\r\nin _American ships_ entering in the ports of France. I hope, either that\r\nthe National Assembly will repeal the measure, or the proposed treaty\r\nbe so hastened, as to get this matter out of the way before it shall be\r\nnecessary for the ensuing legislature to act on it. Their measure, and\r\nour retaliation on it, which is unavoidable, will very illy prepare the\r\nminds of both parties for a liberal treaty. My confidence in the friendly\r\ndispositions of the National Assembly, and in the sincerity of what\r\nthey have expressed on the subject, induce me to impute it to surprise\r\naltogether, and to hope it will be repealed before time shall be given to\r\ntake it up here.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\n                                             Philadelphia, August 30, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--My letter of July the 26th covered my first of exchange for\r\na thousand dollars, and though that went by so sure an opportunity as to\r\nleave little doubt of its receipt, yet, for greater security, I enclose\r\na second.\r\n\r\nThe tranquillity of our country leaves us nothing to relate, which may\r\ninterest a mind surrounded by such buoyant scenes as yours. No matter; I\r\nwill still tell you the charming though homespun news, that our crops of\r\nwheat have been abundant and of superior quality; that very great though\r\npartial drought has destroyed the crops of hay to the north, and corn to\r\nthe south; that the late rains may recover the tobacco to a middling crop,\r\nand that the fields of rice are promising.\r\n\r\nI informed you in my last, of the success of our first expedition against\r\nthe Indians. A second has gone against them, the result of which is not\r\nyet known. Our public credit is good, but the abundance of paper has\r\nproduced a spirit of gambling in the funds, which has laid up our ships\r\nat the wharves, as too slow instruments of profit, and has even disarmed\r\nthe hand of the tailor of his needle and thimble. They say the evil will\r\ncure itself. I wish it may; but I have rarely seen a gamester cured, even\r\nby the disasters of his vocation. Some new indications of the ideas with\r\nwhich the British cabinet are coming into treaty, confirm your opinions,\r\nwhich I know to be right, but the Anglomany of some would not permit them\r\nto accede to.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Sir. Your affectionate humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BENJ. BANNEKER.\r\n\r\n                                             Philadelphia, August 30, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I thank you sincerely for your letter of the 19th instant, and for\r\nthe Almanac it contained. Nobody wishes more than I do to see such proofs\r\nas you exhibit, that nature has given to our black brethren, talents equal\r\nto those of the others colors of men, and that the appearance of a want of\r\nthem is owing merely to the degraded condition of their existence, both\r\nin Africa and America. I can add with truth, that nobody wishes more\r\nardently to see a good system commenced for raising the condition both\r\nof their body and mind to what it ought to be, as fast as the imbecility\r\nof their present existence, and other circumstances which cannot be\r\nneglected, will admit. I have taken the liberty of sending your Almanac\r\nto Monsieur de Condorcet, Secretary of the Academy of Sciences at Paris,\r\nand member of the Philanthropic society, because I considered it as a\r\ndocument to which your color had a right for their justification against\r\nthe doubts which have been entertained of them. I am, with great esteem,\r\nSir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                             Philadelphia, August 30, 1791.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir,--I received some time ago your favor of July 29, and was\r\nhappy to find that you saw in its true point of view the way in which I\r\nhad been drawn into the scene, which must have been so disagreeable to\r\nyou. The importance which you still seem to allow to my note, and the\r\neffect you suppose it to have had, though unintentional in me, induces\r\nme to show you that it really had no effect. Paine's pamphlet, with my\r\nnote, was published here about the second week in May. Not a word ever\r\nappeared in the public papers here on the subject for more than a month;\r\nand I am certain not a word on the subject would ever have been said, had\r\nnot a writer, under the name of Publicola, at length undertaken to attack\r\nMr. Paine's principles, which were the principles of the citizens of the\r\nUnited States. Instantly a host of writers attacked Publicola in support\r\nof those principles. He had thought proper to misconstrue a figurative\r\nexpression in my note; and these writers so far noticed me as to place the\r\nexpression in its true light. But this was only an incidental skirmish\r\npreliminary to the general engagement, and they would not have thought\r\nme worth naming, had not he thought proper to bring me on the scene. His\r\nantagonists, very criminally, in my opinion, presumed you to be Publicola,\r\nand on that presumption hazarded a personal attack on you. No person saw\r\nwith more uneasiness than I did, this unjustifiable assault; and the more\r\nso, when I saw it continued after the printer had declared you were not\r\nthe author. But you will perceive from all this, my dear Sir, that my\r\nnote contributed nothing to the production of these disagreeable pieces.\r\nAs long as Paine's pamphlet stood on its own feet and on my note, it was\r\nunnoticed. As soon as Publicola attacked Paine, swarms appeared in his\r\ndefence. To Publicola, then, and not in the least degree to my note, this\r\nwhole contest is to be ascribed and all its consequences.\r\n\r\nYou speak of the execrable paragraph in the Connecticut papers. This,\r\nit is true, appeared before Publicola; but it had no more relation to\r\nPaine's pamphlet and my note, than to the Alcoran. I am satisfied the\r\nwriter of it had never seen either; for when I passed through Connecticut\r\nabout the middle of June, not a copy had ever been seen by anybody,\r\neither in Hartford or New Haven, nor probably in that whole State; and\r\nthat paragraph was so notoriously the reverse of the disinterestedness\r\nof character which you are known to possess by everybody who knows your\r\nname, that I never heard a person speak of the paragraph, but with an\r\nindignation in your behalf which did you entire justice. This paragraph,\r\nthen, certainly did not flow from my note, any more than the publications\r\nwhich Publicola produced. Indeed it was impossible that my note should\r\noccasion your name to be brought into question; for so far from naming\r\nyou, I had not even in view any writing which I might suppose to be\r\nyours, and the opinions I alluded to were principally those I had heard\r\nin common conversation from a sect aiming at the subversion of the present\r\ngovernment to bring in their favorite form of a king, lords and commons.\r\n\r\nThus I hope, my dear Sir, that you will see me to have been as ignorant\r\n_in effect_ as I was in intention. I was brought before the public without\r\nmy own consent, and from the first moment of seeing the effect of the real\r\naggression in this business to keep me before the public, I determined\r\nthat nothing should induce me to put pen to paper in the controversy.\r\nThe business is now over, and I hope its effects are over, and that our\r\nfriendship will never be suffered to be committed, whatever use others\r\nmay think proper to make of our names.\r\n\r\nThe event of the King's flight from Paris and his recapture, will have\r\nstruck you with its importance. It appears, I think, that the nation is\r\nfirm within, and it only remains to see whether there will be any movement\r\nfrom without. I confess I have not changed my confidence in the favorable\r\nissue of that revolution, because it has always rested on my own ocular\r\nevidence of the unanimity of the nation, and wisdom of the patriotic party\r\nin the National Assembly. The last advices render it probable that the\r\nEmperor will recommence hostilities against the Porte. It remains to see\r\nwhether England and Prussia will take a part. Present me to Mrs. Adams\r\nwith all the affections I feel for her, and be assured of those devoted\r\nto yourself by, my dear Sir, your sincere friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ADMIRAL PAUL JONES.\r\n\r\n                                             Philadelphia, August 31, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I am to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of March 20th,\r\nwith the several papers it enclosed, which were duly communicated to the\r\nPresident. No proof was necessary to satisfy us here of your good conduct\r\neverywhere. In answer to your request to obtain and transmit the proper\r\nauthority of the United States for your retaining the order of St. Anne,\r\nconferred on you by the Empress, I can only say that the Executive of our\r\nGovernment are not authorized either to grant or refuse the permission\r\nyou ask, and consequently cannot take on themselves to do it. Whether the\r\nLegislature would undertake to do it or not, I cannot say. In general,\r\nthere is an aversion to meddle with anything of that kind here. And the\r\nevent would be so doubtful that the Executive would not commit themselves\r\nby making the proposition to the Legislature.\r\n\r\nOur new Constitution works well, and gives general satisfaction Public\r\ncredit is high. We have made a successful expedition against the Indians\r\nthis summer, and another is gone against them, and we hope will induce\r\nthem to peace. A census of our numbers, taken this summer, gives us reason\r\nto believe we are about four millions of all ages and sexes. A state of\r\ntranquil prosperity furnishing no particular and interesting events to\r\ncommunicate to you, I have only to add assurances of the constant esteem\r\nand attachment of, dear Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DE TERNANT, _Minister Plenipotentiary of France_.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, September 1, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have communicated to the President what passed between us the\r\nother day, on the subject of the payments made to France by the United\r\nStates in the _assignats_ of that country, since they have lost their par\r\nwith gold and silver; and after conferences, by his instruction, with\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, I am authorized to assure you, that the\r\ngovernment of the United States have no idea of paying their debt in a\r\ndepreciated medium, and that in the final liquidation of the payments\r\nwhich shall have been made, due regard will be had to an equitable\r\nallowance for the circumstance of depreciation.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. NEWTON.\r\n\r\n                                             Georgetown, September 8, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I was in the moment of my departure from Philadelphia, for\r\nVirginia, when I received your favor, inquiring how far the law of nations\r\nis to govern in proceedings respecting foreign consuls.\r\n\r\nThe law of nations does not of itself extend to consuls at all. They are\r\nnot of the diplomatic class of characters, to which alone that law extends\r\nof right. Convention, indeed, may give it to them, and sometimes has done\r\nso; but in that case, the convention can be produced. In ours with France,\r\nit is expressly declared that consuls shall not have the privileges of\r\nthat law, and we have no convention with any other nation.\r\n\r\nCongress have had before them a bill on the subject of consuls, but have\r\nnot as yet passed it. Their code then furnishes no law to govern these\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nConsequently, _they are to be decided by the State laws alone_. Some of\r\nthese, I know, have given certain privileges to consuls; and I think those\r\nof Virginia did at one time. Of the extent and continuance of those laws,\r\nyou are a better judge than I am.\r\n\r\nIndependently of law, consuls are to be considered as distinguished\r\nforeigners, dignified by a commission from their sovereign, and specially\r\nrecommended by him to the respect of the nation with whom they reside.\r\nThey are subject to the laws of the land, indeed, precisely as other\r\nforeigners are, a convention, where there is one, making a part of the\r\nlaws of the land: but if at any time, their conduct should render it\r\nnecessary to assert the authority of the laws over them, the rigor of\r\nthose laws should be tempered by our respect for their sovereign, as far\r\nas the case will admit. This moderate and respectful treatment towards\r\nforeign consuls, it is my duty to recommend and press on our citizens,\r\nbecause I ask it for their good towards our own consuls, from the people\r\nwith whom they reside.\r\n\r\nIn what I have said, I beg leave to be understood as laying down general\r\nprinciples only, and not as applying them to the facts which may have\r\narisen. Before such application, those facts should be heard from all\r\nwhom they interest. You, who have so heard them, will be able to make the\r\napplication yourself, and that, not only in the present, but in future\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\n                                                          October 26, 1791.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson has the honor of presenting his compliments to Mr. Hammond,\r\nof expressing his regrets that he happened to be from home when Mr.\r\nHammond did him the honor of calling on him, and was equally unlucky in\r\nnot finding him at home when he waited on him on Monday. Being informed\r\nby Mr. Bond, that Mr. Hammond is charged with a public mission to\r\nthe government of the United States, relative to which some previous\r\nexplanations might be proper, Mr. Jefferson has the honor to assure\r\nMr. Hammond, he shall be ready to receive any communications and enter\r\ninto explanations, either formally or informally, as Mr. Hammond shall\r\nchoose, and at any time suitable to him. He recollects with pleasure\r\nhis acquaintance with Mr. Hammond in Paris, and shall be happy in every\r\nopportunity of rendering him such offices and attentions as may be\r\nacceptable to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                          November 1, 1791.\r\n\r\nIn my report on How's case, where I state that it should go to the\r\nPresident, it will become a question with the House whether they shall\r\nrefer it to the President themselves, or give it back to the petitioner,\r\nand let him so address it, as he ought to have done at first. I think\r\nthe latter proper, 1, because it is a case belonging purely to the\r\nExecutive; 2, the legislature should never show itself in a matter with\r\na foreign nation, but where the case is very serious and they mean to\r\ncommit the nation on its issue; 3, because if they indulge individuals in\r\nhanding through the legislature their applications to the Executive, all\r\napplicants will be glad to avail themselves of the weight of so powerful\r\na solicitor. Similar attempts have been repeatedly made by individuals to\r\nget the President to hand in their petitions to the legislature, which he\r\nhas constantly refused. It seems proper that every person should address\r\nhimself directly to the department to which the constitution has allotted\r\nhis case; and that the proper answer to such from any other department is,\r\n\"that it is not to us that the constitution has assigned the transaction\r\nof this business.\" I suggest these things to you, that they may appear to\r\nyou to be right this kind of business may in the first instance be turned\r\ninto its proper channel.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n                                                          November 6, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have the honor to enclose you the draught of a letter to Governor\r\nPinckney, and to observe, that I suppose it to be proper that there\r\nshould, on fit occasions, be a direct correspondence between the President\r\nof the United States and the Governors of the States; and that it will\r\nprobably be grateful to them to receive from the President, answers to\r\nthe letters they address to him. The correspondence with them on ordinary\r\nbusiness, may still be kept up by the Secretary of State, in his own name.\r\n\r\nI enclose also a letter to Major Pinckney, with a blank to be filled up,\r\nwhen you shall have made up your mind on it. I have conferred with Mr.\r\nM. on the idea of the commissioners of the federal town proceeding to\r\nmake private sales of the lots, and he thinks it advisable. I cannot but\r\nrepeat, that if the surveyors will begin on the river, laying off the lots\r\nfrom Rock Creek to the Eastern Branch, and go on abreast, in that way,\r\nfrom the river towards the back part of the town, they may pass the avenue\r\nfrom the President's house to the capitol, before the spring; and as\r\nsoon as they shall have passed it, a public sale may take place, without\r\ninjustice to either the Georgetown or Carrolsburg interest. Will not the\r\npresent afford you a proper occasion of assuring the commissioners, that\r\nyou leave everything respecting L'Enfant to them?\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most sincere respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAJOR THOMAS PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, November 6, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--The mission of a Minister Plenipotentiary to the court of London\r\nbeing now to take place, the President of the United States is desirous of\r\navailing the public of your services in that office. I have it in charge,\r\ntherefore, from him, to ask whether it will be agreeable that he should\r\nnominate you for that purpose to the Senate. We know that higher motives\r\nwill alone influence your mind in the acceptance of this charge. Yet it\r\nis proper, at the same time, to inform you, that as a provision for your\r\nexpenses in the exercise of it, an outfit of nine thousand dollars is\r\nallowed, and an annual salary to the same amount, payable quarterly. On\r\nreceiving your permission, the necessary orders for these sums, together\r\nwith your credentials, shall be forwarded to you, and it would be expected\r\nthat you should proceed on the mission as soon as you can have made those\r\narrangements for your private affairs, which such an absence may render\r\nindispensable. Let me only ask the favor of you to give me an immediate\r\nanswer, and by duplicate, by sea and post, that we may have the benefit of\r\nboth chances for receiving it as early as possible. Though I have not the\r\nhonor of a personal acquaintance with you, yet I beg you to be assured,\r\nthat I feel all that anxiety for your entrance on this important mission,\r\nwhich a thorough conviction of your fitness for it can inspire; and that\r\nin its relations with my office, I shall always endeavor to render it as\r\nagreeable to you as possible.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect and esteem,\r\nSir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, November 7, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have duly considered the letter you were pleased to refer to me,\r\nof the 18th of August, from his Excellency Governor Pinckney to yourself,\r\ntogether with the draught of one proposed to be written by him to the\r\nGovernor of Florida, claiming the re-delivery of certain fugitives from\r\njustice, who have been received in that country. The inconveniences of\r\nsuch a receptacle for debtors and malefactors in the neighborhood of the\r\nsouthern States, are obvious and great, and I wish the remedy were as\r\ncertain and short as the latter seems to suppose.\r\n\r\nThe delivery of fugitives from one country to another, as practised by\r\nseveral nations, is in consequence of conventions settled between them,\r\ndefining precisely the cases wherein such deliveries shall take place.\r\nI know that such conventions exist between France and Spain, France and\r\nSardinia, France and Germany, France and the United Netherlands; between\r\nthe several sovereigns constituting the Germanic body, and, I believe,\r\nvery generally between co-terminous States on the continent of Europe.\r\nEngland has no such convention with any nation, and their laws have given\r\nno power to their executive to surrender fugitives of any description;\r\nthey are, accordingly, constantly refused, and hence England has been the\r\nasylum of the Paolis, the La Mottes, the Calonnes, in short, of the most\r\natrocious offenders as well as the most innocent victims, who have been\r\nable to get there.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the United States, like those of England, receive every\r\nfugitive, and no authority has been given to our executives to deliver\r\nthem up. In the case of Longchamp, a subject of France, a formal demand\r\nwas made by the minister of France, and was refused. He had, indeed,\r\ncommitted an offence within the United States; but he was not demanded as\r\na criminal but as a subject.\r\n\r\nThe French government has shown great anxiety to have such a convention\r\nwith the United States, as might authorize them to command their subjects\r\ncoming here; they got a clause in the consular convention signed by Dr.\r\nFranklin and the Count de Vergennes, giving their consuls a right to take\r\nand send back captains of vessels, mariners and _passengers_. Congress saw\r\nthe extent of the word _passengers_, and refused to ratify the convention;\r\na new one was therefore formed, omitting that word. In fact, however\r\ndesirable it be that the perpetrators of crimes, acknowledged to be such\r\nby all mankind, should be delivered up to punishment, yet it is extremely\r\ndifficult to draw the line between those and acts rendered criminal\r\nby tyrannical laws only; hence the first step always, is a convention\r\ndefining the cases where a surrender shall take place.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the United States could not deliver up to Governor Quesada,\r\na fugitive from the laws of his country, we cannot claim as a right the\r\ndelivery of fugitives from us; and it is worthy consideration, whether\r\nthe demand proposed to be made in Governor Pinckney's letter, should it\r\nbe complied with by the other party, might not commit us disagreeably,\r\nperhaps dishonorably in event; for I do not think we can take for granted,\r\nthat the legislature of the United States will establish a convention for\r\nthe mutual delivery of fugitives; and without a reasonable certainty that\r\nthey will, I think we ought not to give Governor Quesada any grounds to\r\nexpect, that in a similar case, we would re-deliver fugitives from his\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most profound respect and attachment,\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. JOHNSON, STEWART AND CARROL.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, November 21, 1791.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--A Mr. Blodget has a scheme in contemplation for purchasing\r\nand _building_ a whole street in the new city, and any one of them which\r\nyou may think best. The magnitude of the proposition occasioned it to\r\nbe little attended to in the beginning. However, great as it is, it is\r\nbelieved by good judges to be practicable. It may not be amiss, therefore,\r\nto be ready for it. The street most desirable to be built up at once,\r\nwe suppose to be a broad one, (the avenue,) leading from the President's\r\nhouse to the Capitol. To prepare the squares adjoining to that, on both\r\nsides, in the first place, can do no harm; because, if Mr. Blodget's\r\nscheme does not take effect, still it is a part of a work done, which\r\nwas to be done; if his scheme takes effect, you will be in readiness for\r\nhim, which would be desirable. The President, therefore, desires me to\r\nsuggest to you the beginning at once on that avenue, and when all the\r\nsquares on that shall be laid off, they may go on laying off the rest of\r\nthe squares between that and the river, from Georgetown to the eastern\r\nbranch, according to an idea he has suggested to you in a letter not long\r\nsince. This, however, is but a suggestion for the good of the undertaking,\r\non which you will decide as you think proper. I have the honor to be,\r\ngentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. ELLICOTT.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, November 21, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--It is excessively desirable that an extensive sale of lots in\r\nWashington should take place as soon as possible. It has been recommitted\r\nto the commissioners to have all the squares adjacent to the avenue from\r\nthe President's house to the Capitol, on both sides, and from thence to\r\nthe river, through the whole breadth of the ground between Rock Creek and\r\nEastern Branch, first laid off; the object of the present is to ask your\r\n_private_ opinion of the earliest time at which this portion of the work\r\ncan be completed, which I will beg the favor of you to communicate to me\r\nby letter. In order that the sale may not be delayed by the engraving,\r\nit is hoped that by communicating what is executed from time to time, the\r\nengraver may nearly keep pace with you.\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, November 24, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--My last to you was of August the 29th, acknowledging the\r\nreceipt of your Nos. 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, and informing you I was about\r\nsetting out to Virginia, and should not again write to you till my return.\r\nOnly one vessel has sailed from hence to Havre since my return, and my\r\nnotice of her departure was so short, that I could not avail myself of\r\nit. Your Nos. 72, 73, 74, 75, 78, came here during my absence, and 79,\r\n80, were received October the 28th. The Nos. 76 and 77 seem to be missing.\r\n\r\nYou mention that Drost wishes the devices of our money to be sent to him,\r\nthat he may engrave them there. This cannot be done, because not yet\r\ndecided on. The devices will be fixed by the law which shall establish\r\nthe mint. M. de Ternant tells me he has no instructions to propose to us\r\nthe negotiation of a commercial treaty, and that he does not expect any.\r\nI wish it were possible to draw that negotiation to this place. In your\r\nletter of July the 24th, is the following paragraph. \"It is published\r\nin the English newspapers, that war is inevitable between the United\r\nStates and Spain, and that preparations are making for it on both sides.\r\nM. de Montmorin asked me how the business stood at present, and seemed\r\nsomewhat surprised at my telling him, that I knew nothing later than\r\nwhat I had formerly mentioned to him. I have, in more than one instance,\r\nexperienced the inconvenience of being without information. In this, it is\r\ndisagreeable, as it may have the appearance with M. de Montmorin, of my\r\nhaving something to conceal from him, which not being the case, it would\r\nbe wrong that he should be allowed to take up such an idea. I observed,\r\nthat I did not suppose there was any new circumstance, as you had not\r\ninformed me of it.\" Your observation was certainly just. It would be\r\nan Augean task for me to go through the London newspapers, and formally\r\ncontradict all their lies, even those relating to America. On our side,\r\nthere having been certainly no preparations for war against Spain; nor\r\nhave I heard of any on their part, but _in the London newspapers_. As to\r\nthe progress of the negotiation, I know nothing of it but from you; having\r\nnever had a letter from Mr. Carmichael on the subject. Our best newspapers\r\nare sent you from my office with scrupulous exactness, by every vessel\r\nsailing to Havre or any other convenient port of France. On these I rely\r\nfor giving you information of all the facts possessed by the public; and\r\nas to those not possessed by them, I think there has not been a single\r\ninstance of my leaving you uninformed of any of them which related to\r\nthe matters under your charge. In Freneau's paper of the 21st instant,\r\nyou will see a small essay on population and emigration, which I think it\r\nwould be well if the news writers of Paris would translate and insert in\r\ntheir papers. The sentiments are too just not to make impression.\r\n\r\nSome proceedings of the assembly of St. Domingo have lately taken place,\r\nwhich it is necessary for me to state to you exactly, that you may be able\r\nto do the same to M. de Montmorin. When the insurrection of their negroes\r\nassumed a very threatening appearance, the Assembly sent a deputy here to\r\nask assistance of military stores and provisions. He addressed himself to\r\nM. de Ternant, who (the President being then in Virginia, as I was also)\r\napplied to the Secretaries of the Treasury and War. They furnished one\r\nthousand stand of arms, other military stores, and placed forty thousand\r\ndollars in the treasury, subject to the order of M. de Ternant, to be\r\nlaid out in provisions, or otherwise, as he should think best. He sent\r\nthe arms and other military stores; but the want of provisions did not\r\nseem so instantaneous as to render it necessary, in his opinion, to send\r\nany at that time. Before the vessel arrived in St. Domingo, the Assembly,\r\nfurther urged by the appearance of danger, sent two deputies more, with\r\nlarger demands, viz., eight thousand fusils and bayonets, two thousand\r\nmousquators, three thousand pistols, three thousand sabres, twenty-four\r\nthousand barrels of flour, four hundred thousand livres worth of Indian\r\nmeal, rice, peas, and hay, and a large quantity of plank, &c. to repair\r\nthe buildings destroyed. They applied to M. de Ternant, and then with\r\nhis consent to me, he and I having previously had a conversation on the\r\nsubject. They proposed to me, first, that we should supply those wants\r\nfrom the money we owed France; or secondly, from the bills of exchange\r\nwhich they were authorized to draw on a particular fund in France; or\r\nthirdly, that we would guarantee their bills, in which case they could\r\ndispose of them to merchants, and buy the necessaries themselves. I\r\nconvinced them the two latter alternatives were beyond the powers of\r\nthe executive, and the first could only be done with the consent of the\r\nminister of France. In the course of our conversation, I expressed to\r\nthem our sincere attachment to France and all its dominions, and most\r\nespecially to them who were our neighbors, and whose interests had some\r\ncommon points of union with ours in matters of commerce; that we wished,\r\ntherefore, to render them every service they needed, but that we could\r\nnot do it in any way disagreeable to France; that they must be sensible,\r\nthat M. de Ternant might apprehend that jealousy would be excited by\r\ntheir addressing themselves directly to foreign powers, and therefore,\r\nthat a concert with him in their applications to us, was essential. The\r\nsubject of independence, and their views towards it having been stated in\r\nthe public papers, this led our conversation to it; and I must say, they\r\nappeared as far from these views as any persons on earth. I expressed\r\nto them freely my opinion, that such an object was neither desirable on\r\ntheir part, nor attainable; that, as to ourselves, there was one case\r\nwhich would be peculiarly alarming to us, to wit, were there a danger of\r\ntheir falling under any other power; that we conceived it to be strongly\r\nour interests, that they should retain their connection with the mother\r\ncountry; that we had a common interest with them, in furnishing them\r\nthe necessaries of life in exchange for sugar and coffee for our own\r\nconsumption, but that I thought we might rely on the justice of the\r\nmother country towards them, for their obtaining this privilege; and on\r\nthe whole, let them see that nothing was to be done, but with the consent\r\nof the minister of France. I am convinced myself that their views and\r\ntheir application to us are perfectly innocent; however, M. de Ternant,\r\nand still more, M. de La Forest, are jealous. The deputies, on the other\r\nhand, think that M. de Ternant is not sensible enough of their wants. They\r\ndelivered me sealed letters to the President and to Congress. That to the\r\nPresident contained only a picture of their distresses, and application\r\nfor relief. That to Congress, I know no otherwise than through the\r\npublic papers. The Senate read it, and sent it to the Representatives,\r\nwho read it, and have taken no other notice of it. The line of conduct I\r\npursue is, to persuade these gentlemen to be contented with such moderate\r\nsupplies, from time to time, as will keep them from real distress, and\r\nto wait with patience for what would be a surplus, till M. de Ternant can\r\nreceive instructions from France, which he has reason to expect within a\r\nfew weeks; and I encourage the latter gentleman even to go beyond their\r\nabsolute wants of the moment, so far as to keep them in good humor. He\r\nis accordingly proposing to lay out ten thousand dollars for them, for\r\nthe present. It would be ridiculous in the present case, to talk about\r\nforms. There are situations when form must be dispensed with. A man\r\nattacked by assassins will call for help to those nearest him, and will\r\nnot think himself bound to silence till a magistrate may come to his aid.\r\nIt would be unwise in the highest degree, that the colonists should be\r\ndisgusted with either France or us; for it might then be made to depend\r\non the moderation of another power, whether what appears a chimera might\r\nnot become a reality. I have thought it necessary to go thus fully into\r\nthis transaction, and particularly as to the sentiments I have expressed\r\nto them, that you may be enabled to place our proceedings in their true\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nOur Indian expeditions have proved successful. As yet, however, they\r\nhave not led to peace. Mr. Hammond has lately arrived here as Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary from the court of London, and we propose to name one\r\nto that court in return. Congress will probably establish the ratio of\r\nrepresentation by a bill now before them, at one representative for every\r\nthirty thousand inhabitants. Besides the newspapers, as usual, you will\r\nreceive herewith the census lately taken, by towns and counties as well\r\nas by States.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, November 29, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--My last to you was of August 23, acknowledging the receipt\r\nof your Nos. 19, 21, and 22. Since that, I have received from 23 to 33\r\ninclusive. In mine, I informed you I was about setting out for Virginia,\r\nand consequently should not write to you till my return. This opportunity,\r\nby Captain Wicks, is the first since my return.\r\n\r\nThe party which had gone, at the date of my last, against the Indians\r\nnorth of the Ohio, were commanded by General Wilkinson, and were as\r\nsuccessful as the first, having killed and taken about eighty persons,\r\nburnt some towns, and lost, I believe, not a man. As yet, however, it\r\nhas not produced peace. A very formidable insurrection of the negroes\r\nin French St. Domingo has taken place. From thirty to fifty thousand\r\nare said to be in arms. They have sent here for aids of military stores\r\nand provisions, which we furnish just as far as the French minister here\r\napproves. Mr. Hammond is arrived here as Minister Plenipotentiary from\r\nGreat Britain, and we are about sending one to that court from hence.\r\nThe census, particularly as to each part of every State, is now in the\r\npress; if done in time for this conveyance, it shall be forwarded. The\r\nLegislature have before them a bill for allowing one representative for\r\nevery thirty thousand persons, which has passed the Representatives, and\r\nis now with the Senate. Some late inquiries into the state of our domestic\r\nmanufactories give a very flattering result. Their extent is great and\r\ngrowing through all the States. Some manufactories on a large scale are\r\nunder contemplation. As to the article of Etrennes inquired after in one\r\nof your letters, it was under consideration in the first instance, when\r\nit was submitted to the President, to decide on the articles of account\r\nwhich should be allowed the foreign ministers in addition to their salary;\r\nand this article was excluded, as everything was meant to be which was\r\nnot in the particular enumeration I gave you. With respect to foreign\r\nnewspapers, I receive those of Amsterdam, France, and London so regularly,\r\nand so early, that I will not trouble you for any of them; but I will\r\nthank you for those of Lisbon and Madrid, and in your letters to give\r\nme all the information you can of Spanish affairs, as I have never yet\r\nreceived but one letter from Mr. Carmichael, which you I believe brought\r\nfrom Madrid. You will receive with this a pamphlet by Mr. Coxe in answer\r\nto Lord Sheffield, Freneau and Fenn's papers. I am, with great and sincere\r\nesteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DANIEL SMITH, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, November 29, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of September 1 and\r\nOctober 4, together with the report of the Executive proceedings in the\r\nSouth-Western government from March 1 to July 26.\r\n\r\nIn answer to that part of yours of September 1 on the subject of a seal\r\nfor the use of that government, I think it extremely proper and necessary,\r\nand that one should be provided at public expense.\r\n\r\nThe opposition made by Governor Blount and yourself to all attempts by\r\ncitizens of the United States to settle within the Indian lines without\r\nauthority from the General Government, is approved, and should be\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nThere being a prospect that Congress, who have now the Post office bill\r\nbefore them, will establish a post from Richmond to Stanton, and continue\r\nit thence towards the South-West government a good distance, if not nearly\r\nto it, our future correspondence will be more easy, quick, and certain.\r\nI am, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, December 5, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--The enclosed memorial from the British minister, on the case\r\nof Thomas Pagan, containing a complaint of injustice in the dispensations\r\nof law by the courts of Massachusetts, to a British subject, the President\r\napproves of my referring it to you, to report thereon your opinion of the\r\nproceedings, and whether anything, and what, can or ought to be done by\r\nthe government in consequence thereof.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Memorial of the British Minister._\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, his Britannic Majesty's Minister Plenipotentiary to the\r\nUnited States of America, has the honor of laying before the Secretary\r\nof State, the following brief abstract of the case of Thomas Pagan, a\r\nsubject of his Britannic Majesty, now confined in the prison of Boston,\r\nunder an execution issued against him out of the Supreme judicial court of\r\nMassachusetts Bay. To this abstract, the undersigned has taken the liberty\r\nof annexing some observations, which naturally arise out of the statement\r\nof the transaction, and which may perhaps tend to throw some small degree\r\nof light on the general merits of the case.\r\n\r\nIn the late war, Thomas Pagan was agent for, and part owner of a privateer\r\ncalled the Industry, which, on the 25th of March, 1783, off Cape Ann,\r\ncaptured a brigantine called the Thomas, belonging to Mr. Stephen Hooper,\r\nof Newport. The brigantine and cargo were libelled in the court of\r\nvice-admiralty in Nova Scotia, and that court ordered the prize to be\r\nrestored. An appeal was, however, moved for by the captors, and regularly\r\nprosecuted in England before the Lords of Appeals for prize causes, who,\r\nin February, 1790, reversed the decree of the vice-admiralty court of Nova\r\nScotia, and condemned the brigantine and cargo as good and lawful prize.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1788, a judgment was obtained by Stephen Hooper in the court\r\nof common pleas for the county of Essex, in Massachusetts, against Thomas\r\nPagan, for three thousand five hundred pounds lawful money, for money had\r\nand received to the plaintiff's use. An appeal was brought thereon in May,\r\n1789, to the Supreme judicial court of the commonwealth of Massachusetts,\r\nheld at Ipswich, for the county of Essex, and on the 16th of June, 1789,\r\na verdict was found for Mr. Hooper, and damages were assessed at three\r\nthousand and nine pounds two shillings and ten pence, which sum is \"for\r\nthe vessel called the brigantine Thomas, her cargo and every article\r\nfound on board.\" After this verdict, and before entering the judgment,\r\nMr. Pagan moved for a new trial, suggesting that the verdict was against\r\nlaw; because the merits of the case originated in a question, whether a\r\ncertain brigantine called the Thomas, with her cargo, taken on the high\r\nseas by a private ship of war called the Industry, was prize or no prize,\r\nand that the court had no authority to give judgment in a cause where the\r\npoint of a resulting or implied promise arose upon a question of this\r\nsort. The supreme judicial court refused this motion for a new trial,\r\nbecause it appeared to the court, that in order to a legal decision it is\r\nnot necessary to inquire whether this prize and her cargo were prize or no\r\nprize, and because the case did not, in their opinion, involve a question\r\nrelative to any matter or thing necessarily consequent upon the capture\r\nthereof: it was therefore considered by the court, that Hooper should\r\nreceive of Pagan three thousand and nine pounds two shillings and ten\r\npence lawful money, damages: and taxed costs, sixteen pounds two shillings\r\nand ten pence. From this judgment, Pagan claimed an appeal to the supreme\r\njudicial court of the United States of America, for these reasons: that\r\nthe judgment was given in an action brought by Hooper, who is, and at\r\nthe time of commencing the action was, a citizen of the commonwealth of\r\nMassachusetts, one of the United States, against Pagan, who, at the time\r\nwhen the action was commenced, was, and ever since has been, a subject\r\nof the King of Great Britain, residing in and inhabiting his province of\r\nNew Brunswick. This claim of an appeal was not allowed, because it was\r\nconsidered by the court, that this court was the supreme judicial court\r\nof the commonwealth of Massachusetts, from whose judgment there is no\r\nappeal; and further, because there does not exist any such court within\r\nthe United States of America as that to which Pagan has claimed an appeal\r\nfrom the judgment of this court. Thereupon, execution issued against Pagan\r\non the 9th of October, 1789, and he has been confined in Boston prison\r\never since.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, that in August, 1789, Mr. Pagan petitioned the\r\nsupreme judicial court of Massachusetts for a new trial, and after hearing\r\nthe arguments of counsel, a new trial was refused. On the 1st of January,\r\n1791, his Britannic Majesty's consul at Boston applied for redress on\r\nbehalf of Mr. Pagan, to the Governor of Massachusetts Bay, who, in his\r\nletter of the 28th of January, 1791, was pleased to recommend this matter\r\nto the serious attention of the Senate and House of Representatives of\r\nthat State. On the 14th of February, 1791, the British consul memorialized\r\nthe Senate and House of Representatives on this subject. On the 22d of\r\nFebruary, a committee of both Houses reported a resolution, that the\r\nmemorial of the consul and message from the Governor, with all the papers,\r\nbe referred to the consideration of the justices of the supreme judicial\r\ncourt, who were directed, as far as may be, to examine into and consider\r\nthe circumstances of the case, and if they found that by the force and\r\neffect allowed by the law of nations to foreign admiralty jurisdictions,\r\n&c., Hooper ought not to have recovered judgment against Pagan, the\r\ncourt was authorized to grant a review of the action. On the 13th of\r\nJune, 1791, the British consul again represented to the Senate and House\r\nof Representatives, that the justices of the supreme judicial court had\r\nnot been pleased to signify their decision on this subject, referred\r\nto them by the resolution of the 22d of February. This representation\r\nwas considered by a committee of the Senate and of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, who concluded that one of them should make inquiry of\r\nsome of the judges to know their determination, and upon being informed\r\nthat the judges intended to give their opinion, with their reasons, _in\r\nwriting_, the committee would not proceed any further in the business.\r\nOn the 27th of June, 1791, Mr. Pagan's counsel moved the justices of the\r\nsupreme judicial court for their opinion in the case of Hooper and Pagan,\r\nreferred to their consideration by the resolve of the General Court,\r\nfounded on the British consul's memorial. Chief Justice and Justice Dana\r\nbeing absent, Justice Paine delivered it as the unanimous opinion of the\r\njudges absent as well as present, that Pagan was not entitled to a new\r\ntrial for any of the causes mentioned in the said resolve, and added,\r\n\"that the court intended to put their opinions upon paper, and to file\r\nthem in the cause: that the sickness of two of the court had hitherto\r\nprevented it, but that it would soon be done.\"\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat remarkable, that the supreme judicial court of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, should allege that this case did not necessarily\r\ninvolve a question relative to prize or no prize, when the very jury to\r\nwhom the court referred the decision of the case established the fact;\r\ntheir verdict was for three thousand and nine pounds two shillings and ten\r\npence, damages, which sum is for the vessel called the brigantine Thomas,\r\nher cargo, and everything found on board. Hence it is evident, that the\r\ncase _did_ involve a question of prize or no prize, and having received\r\na formal decision by the only court competent to take cognizance thereof,\r\n(viz. the high court of appeals for prize causes in England,) everything\r\nthat at all related to the property in question, or to the legality of the\r\ncapture, was thereby finally determined. The legality of the capture being\r\nconfirmed by the high court of appeals in England, cannot consistently\r\nwith the principles of the law of nations be discussed in a foreign\r\ncourt of law, or at least, if a foreign court of common law is, by any\r\nlocal regulations, deemed competent to interfere in matters relating to\r\ncaptures, the decisions of admiralty courts or courts of appeal, should be\r\nreceived and taken as conclusive evidence of the legality or illegality of\r\ncaptures. By such decisions, property is either adjudged to the captors\r\nor restored to the owners; if adjudged to the captors, they obtain a\r\npermanent property in the captured goods acquired by the rights of war,\r\nand this principle originates in the wisdom of nations, and is calculated\r\nto prevent endless litigation.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts Bay, are\r\nin direct violation of the rules and usages that have been universally\r\npractised among nations in the determination of the validity of captures,\r\nand of all collateral questions that may have reference thereto. The\r\nGeneral Court of Massachusetts Bay, among other things, kept this point\r\nin view, when they referred the case of Mr. Pagan to the consideration of\r\nthe justices of the supreme judicial court, and authorized the court to\r\ngrant a review of the action, if it should be found that by the force and\r\neffect allowed by the law of nations to foreign admiralty jurisdictions,\r\nMr. Hooper ought not to have recovered judgment against Mr. Pagan. But the\r\nsupreme judicial court have not only evaded this material consideration,\r\nupon which the whole question incontestibly turns, but have assumed a fact\r\nin direct contradiction to the truth of the case, viz. that the case did\r\nnot involve a question of prize or no prize. Moreover, they have denied\r\nMr. Pagan the benefit of appeal to that court which is competent to decide\r\non the force of treaties, and which court, by the constitution of the\r\nUnited States, is declared to possess _appellate_ jurisdiction both as to\r\nlaw and fact, in all cases of controversy between citizens of the United\r\nStates and subjects of foreign countries, to which class this case is\r\npeculiarly and strictly to be referred.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing abstract of the case of Thomas Pagan, it appears that\r\nhe is now detained in prison, in Boston, in consequence of a judgment\r\ngiven by a court which is not competent to decide upon his case, or which,\r\nif competent, refused to admit the only evidence that ought to have given\r\njurisdiction, and that he is denied the means of appealing to the highest\r\ncourt of judicature known in these States, which exists in the very\r\norganization of the constitution of the United States, and is declared to\r\npossess appellate jurisdiction in all cases of a nature similar to this.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the undersigned begs leave respectfully to submit\r\nthe whole matter to the consideration of the Secretary of State, and to\r\nrequest him to take such measures as may appear to him the best adapted\r\nfor the purpose of obtaining for the said Thomas Pagan, such speedy and\r\neffectual redress as his case may seem to require.\r\n\r\n                                                            George Hammond.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, November 26, 1791.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MCALISTER.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, December 22, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--I am favored with yours of the 1st of November, and recollect with\r\npleasure our acquaintance in Virginia. With respect to the schools of\r\nEurope, my mind is perfectly made up, and on full enquiry. The best in the\r\nworld is Edinburgh. Latterly, too, the spirit of republicanism has become\r\nthat of the students in general, and of the younger professors; so on that\r\naccount also it is eligible for an American. On the continent of Europe,\r\nno place is comparable to Geneva. The sciences are there more modernized\r\nthan anywhere else. There, too, the spirit of republicanism is strong with\r\nthe body of the inhabitants: but that of aristocracy is strong also with\r\na particular class; so that it is of some consequence to attend to the\r\nclass of society in which a youth is made to move. It is a cheap place.\r\nOf all these particulars Mr. Kinloch and Mr. Huger, of South Carolina, can\r\ngive you the best account, as they were educated there, and the latter is\r\nlately from thence. I have the honor to be, with great esteem, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. STUART.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, December 23, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I received duly your favor of October 22, and should have\r\nanswered it by the gentleman who delivered it, but that he left town\r\nbefore I knew of it.\r\n\r\nThat it is really important to provide a constitution for our State cannot\r\nbe doubted: as little can it be doubted that the ordinance called by that\r\nname has important defects. But before we attempt it, we should endeavor\r\nto be as certain as is practicable that in the attempt we should not make\r\nbad worse. I have understood that Mr. Henry has always been opposed to\r\nthis undertaking; and I confess that I consider his talents and influence\r\nsuch as that, were it decided that we should call a convention for the\r\npurpose of amending, I should fear he might induce that convention either\r\nto fix the thing as at present, or change it for the worse. Would it not\r\ntherefore be well that means should be adopted for coming at his ideas of\r\nthe changes he would agree to, and for communicating to him those which\r\nwe should propose? Perhaps he might find ours not so distant from his,\r\nbut that some mutual sacrifices might bring them together.\r\n\r\nI shall hazard my own ideas to you as hastily as my business obliges me.\r\nI wish to preserve the line drawn by the federal constitution between the\r\ngeneral and particular governments as it stands at present, and to take\r\nevery prudent means of preventing either from stepping over it. Though\r\nthe experiment has not yet had a long enough course to show us from which\r\nquarter encroachments are most to be feared, yet it is easy to foresee,\r\nfrom the nature of things, that the encroachments of the State governments\r\nwill tend to an excess of liberty which will correct itself, (as in\r\nthe late instance,) while those of the general government will tend to\r\nmonarchy, which will fortify itself from day to day, instead of working\r\nits own cure, as all experience shows. I would rather be exposed to the\r\ninconveniences attending too much liberty, than those attending too small\r\na degree of it. Then it is important to strengthen the State governments;\r\nand as this cannot be done by any change in the federal constitution, (for\r\nthe preservation of that is all we need contend for,) it must be done by\r\nthe States themselves, erecting such barriers at the constitutional line\r\nas cannot be surmounted either by themselves or by the general government.\r\nThe only barrier in their power is a wise government. A weak one will\r\nlose ground in every contest. To obtain a wise and an able government,\r\nI consider the following changes as important. Render the legislature a\r\ndesirable station by lessening the number of representatives (say to 100)\r\nand lengthening somewhat their term, and proportion them equally among\r\nthe electors. Adopt also a better mode of appointing senators. Render\r\nthe Executive a more desirable post to men of abilities by making it\r\nmore independent of the legislature. To wit, let him be chosen by other\r\nelectors, for a longer time, and ineligible forever after. Responsibility\r\nis a tremendous engine in a free government. Let him feel the whole\r\nweight of it then, by taking away the shelter of his executive council.\r\nExperience both ways has already established the superiority of this\r\nmeasure. Render the judiciary respectable by every possible means, to wit,\r\nfirm tenure in office, competent salaries, and reduction of their numbers.\r\nMen of high learning and abilities are few in every country; and by taking\r\nin those who are not so, the able part of the body have their hands tied\r\nby the unable. This branch of the government will have the weight of the\r\nconflict on their hands, because they will be the last appeal of reason.\r\nThese are my general ideas of amendments; but, preserving the ends, I\r\nshould be flexible and conciliatory as to the means. You ask whether Mr.\r\nMadison and myself could attend on a convention which should be called?\r\nMr. Madison's engagements as a member of Congress will probably be from\r\nOctober to March or April in every year. Mine are constant while I hold\r\nmy office, and my attendance would be very unimportant. Were it otherwise,\r\nmy office should not stand in the way of it. I am, with great and sincere\r\nesteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, December 23, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,--As the conditions of our commerce with the French and British\r\ndominions are important, and a moment seems to be approaching when it\r\nmay be useful that both should be accurately understood, I have thrown\r\na representation of them into the form of a table, showing at one view\r\nhow the principal articles interesting to our agriculture and navigation,\r\nstand in the European and American dominions of these two powers. As to so\r\nmuch of it as respects France, I have cited under every article the law on\r\nwhich it depends; which laws, from 1784 downwards, are in my possession.\r\n\r\nPort charges are so different, according to the size of the vessel and the\r\ndexterity of the captain, that an examination of a greater number of port\r\nbills might, perhaps, produce a different result. I can only say, that\r\nthat expressed in the table is fairly drawn from such bills as I could\r\nreadily get access to, and that I have no reason to suppose it varies much\r\nfrom the truth, nor on which side the variation would lie. Still, I cannot\r\nmake myself responsible for this article. The authorities cited will vouch\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect respect and attachment, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n_Footing of the Commerce of the United States with France and England,\r\nand with the French and English American Colonies._\r\n\r\n  -------------+------------------------------+--------------------------\r\n               | France.                      |Great Britain and Ireland.\r\n  -------------+------------------------------+--------------------------\r\n  Wheat        | (_a_)                        | Prohibited till it is\r\n  flour, &c.   | Free.                        | 6s. 4d. the bushel.\r\n  -------------+------------------------------+--------------------------\r\n               | (_a_)                        | 7s. 4d. sterling\r\n  Rice.        | Free.                        | the kental.\r\n  -------------+------------------------------+--------------------------\r\n               | (_b_)                        |\r\n  Salted fish. | 8 livres the kental.         | Prohibited.\r\n  -------------+------------------------------+--------------------------\r\n               | (_c_)                        |\r\n  Salted beef. | 5 livres the kental.         | Prohibited.\r\n  -------------+------------------------------+--------------------------\r\n               | (_d_)                        |\r\n  Salted pork. | 5 livres the kental          |\r\n               | in some ports.               | 44s. 9d. the kental.\r\n               | Prohibited in others.        |\r\n  -------------+------------------------------+--------------------------\r\n               | (_a_)                        |\r\n  Furs.        | Free.                        | 15 to 20 per cent.\r\n  -------------+------------------------------+--------------------------\r\n               | (_c_)                        |\r\n  Indigo.      | 5 livres the kental.         | Free.\r\n  -------------+------------------------------+--------------------------\r\n               | (_a_)                        |\r\n  Whale oil.   | 7 livres and 10 sous         |\r\n               | the barrel of 520 lbs.       | £18 3s. the ton.\r\n  -------------+------------------------------+-------------------\r\n               | (_a_)                        |\r\n               | 2½ per cent.              |\r\n  Tar, pitch,  | 5 sous the kental,           | 11d. 11s. 2s. 3d.

August the 30th, 1784.\r\n\r\n(_d_) By _Arret_ of 1788.\r\n\r\n(_e_) By _Arret_ of 1760.\r\n\r\n(_f_) Taken from the Custom House returns of the United States.\r\n\r\n(_g_) There is a general law of France prohibiting foreign flour in\r\ntheir islands, with a suspending power to their Governors, in cases of\r\nnecessity. An _Arret_ of May the 9th, 1789, by their Governor, makes it\r\nfree till August, 1794; and in fact it is generally free there.\r\n\r\n(_h_) The _Arret_ of September the 18th, 1785, gave a premium of ten\r\nlivres the kental, on fish brought in their own bottoms, for five years,\r\nso that the law expired September the 18th, 1790. Another _Arret_, passed\r\na week after, laid a duty of five livres the kental, on fish brought in\r\nforeign vessels, to raise money for the premium before mentioned. The\r\nlast _Arret_ was not limited in time; yet seems to be understood as only\r\ncommensurate with the other. Accordingly, an _Arret_ of May the 9th, 1789,\r\nhas made fish in foreign bottoms liable to three livres the kental only\r\ntill August the 1st, 1794.\r\n\r\n(_i_) The port charges are estimated from bills collected from the\r\nmerchants of Philadelphia. They are different in different ports of the\r\nsame country, and different in the same ports on vessels of different\r\nsizes. Where I had several bills of the same port, I averaged them\r\ntogether. The dollar is rated at 4s. 4½d. sterling in England, at 6s.\r\n8d. in the British West Indies, and five livres twelve sous in France,\r\nand at eight livres five sous in the French West Indies.\r\n\r\nSeveral articles stated to be _free_ in France, do in fact pay one-eighth\r\nof a per cent., which was retained merely to oblige an entry to be made in\r\ntheir Custom House books. In like manner, several of the articles stated\r\nto be _free_ in England, do, in fact, pay a light duty. The English duties\r\nare taken from the book of rates.\r\n\r\n                                                                   Dollars.\r\n\r\n  (_k_) The exports to Great Britain and Ireland, are          6,888,978 50\r\n\r\n  How much they consume, I know not. They certainly re-export the\r\n  following:\r\n\r\n                                                        Dollars.\r\n\r\n  Grain, the whole since the law of the last parliament 1,093,885\r\n  Tobacco, five-sixths, according to Sheffield's tables 2,295,411\r\n  Rice, five-sevenths, according to same                  552,750\r\n  Indigo, one-third, according to same                    315,887\r\n  Furs, probably one-half                                  17,950\r\n  Ginseng, the whole                                       32,424\r\n  Mahogany,} not being of our productions should also be   16,724\r\n  Wine,    }   deducted                                     4,425\r\n                                                          ---- 4,329,456 00\r\n                                                               ------------\r\n  Remainder, including their consumption and the unknown       2,559,522 50\r\n     re-exportations\r\n  The exportations certainly known then, are five-eighths of the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n                                             Philadelphia, January 4, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--Having been in conversation to-day with Monsieur Payan, one of the\r\nSt. Domingo deputies, I took occasion to inquire of him the footing on\r\nwhich our commerce there stands at present, and particularly whether the\r\ncolonial _Arret_ of 1789, permitting a free importation of our flour till\r\n1793, was still in force. He answered, that that _Arret_ was revoked in\r\nFrance on the clamors of the merchants there; and with a like permission\r\nto carry flour to the three usual ports, and he thinks to bring away\r\ncoffee and sugar, was immediately renewed by the Governor. Whether\r\nthis has been regularly kept up by renewed _Arrets_, during the present\r\ntroubles, he cannot say, but is sure that in practice it has never been\r\ndiscontinued, and that not by contraband, but openly and legally, as is\r\nunderstood. The public application to us to send flour there, is a proof\r\nof it. Instead, therefore, of resting this permission on a colonial\r\n_Arret_ till 1793, it should be rested on temporary _Arrets_ renewed\r\nfrom time to time, as heretofore. This correction of the notes I took the\r\nliberty of laying before you, with the table containing a comparative view\r\nof our commerce with France and England, I thought it my duty to make.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect respect and attachment, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SHORT.\r\n                                           _Philadelphia_, January 5, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--My last to you was of November 24th, since which I have\r\nreceived yours, Nos. 76, 77, and 81 to 87 inclusive. Your letter of\r\nOctober 6th, with your account to June, 1791, is not yet arrived, nor\r\nthe box mentioned in your number 84. The memorial of the crew of the\r\n_Indian_ shall be sent to the Governor of South Carolina. In a former\r\nletter I informed you that two balanciers would suffice for us, which will\r\nhave served as an answer to that part of your late letters on the same\r\nsubject. With respect to the Assayer, it will be better to defer taking\r\nany measures till the bill establishing a mint, which is now before the\r\nlegislature, shall have passed.\r\n\r\nWe have been in expectation for some time that some overture would have\r\nbeen made to us from the Court of France, on the subject of the treaty of\r\ncommerce recommended by the National Assembly to be entered into between\r\nthe two nations. The executive of ours are perfectly disposed to meet\r\nsuch overtures, and to concur in giving them effect on the most liberal\r\nprinciples. This sentiment you may freely express to the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs.\r\n\r\nWe receive with deep regret daily information of the progress of\r\ninsurrection and devastation in St. Domingo. Nothing indicates as yet that\r\nthe evil is at its height, and the materials, as yet untouched, but open\r\nto conflagration, are immense. The newspapers heretofore sent you, and\r\nthose now sent, will have informed you of a very bloody action we have had\r\nwith the Northern Indians, in which our army was defeated. This imposes\r\nthe necessity of stronger preparations than were before thought requisite.\r\n\r\nSome communications from the Court of Madrid having been lately, for the\r\nfirst time, made to us, these shall be the subject of a separate letter.\r\n\r\nYou mention some failures in the receipt of the journals of Congress\r\nand other public papers. I trust always to Mr. Remson to make them up\r\nfrom time to time, and I can answer for his punctuality. I send you his\r\nstatement of those which have been sent, so that the failure has probably\r\narisen from the inexactitude of those to whom they have been confided.\r\nAt present we watch for vessels bound to Havre whereby to send them. You\r\nwill receive some by the _de Jeune Eole_, which sails from hence to that\r\nport next week. I am not certain whether this letter will go by the same\r\nconveyance, or by the English packet. I am, with the highest esteem and\r\nattachment, your affectionate humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, January 17, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--Your favors of November the 29th, 30th, and December the 1st, came\r\nduly to hand, and gave sincere pleasure, by announcing your disposition to\r\naccept the appointment to London. The nominations to Paris and the Hague\r\nhaving been detained till yours could be made, they were all immediately\r\nsent in to the Senate, to wit, yourself for London, Mr. G. Morris for\r\nParis, Mr. Short for the Hague. Some members of the Senate, apprehending\r\nthey had a right of determining on the _expediency_ of foreign missions,\r\nas well as on the _persons_ named, took that occasion of bringing forward\r\nthe discussion of that question, by which the nominations were delayed two\r\nor three weeks. I am happy to be able to assure you, that not a single\r\npersonal motive with respect to yourself entered into the objections to\r\nthese appointments. On the contrary, I believe that your nomination gave\r\ngeneral satisfaction. Your commission will be immediately made out, but\r\nas the opportunities of conveyance at this season are precarious, and you\r\npropose coming to this place, I think it better to retain it.\r\n\r\nAs to the delay proposed in your letter, it was to be expected: indeed,\r\na winter passage from Charleston to this place, or across the Atlantic,\r\nis so disagreeable, that if either that circumstance or the arrangement\r\nof your affairs should render it in the smallest degree eligible to you,\r\nto remain at home till the temperate season comes on, stay till after the\r\nvernal equinox; there will be no inconvenience to the public attending\r\nit. On the contrary, as we are just opening certain negotiations with\r\nthe British minister here, which have not yet assumed any determinate\r\ncomplexion, a delay till that time will enable us to form some judgment\r\nof the issue they make take, and to know exactly in what way your\r\nco-operation at the place of your destination, may aid us. On this and\r\nother accounts, it will be highly useful that you take this place in\r\nyour way, where, or at New York, you will always be sure of finding a\r\nconvenient passage to England.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, January 23, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I have the pleasure to inform you, that the President of the\r\nUnited States has appointed you minister resident for the United States\r\nat the Hague, which was approved by the Senate on the 16th instant.\r\nThis new mark of the President's confidence will be the more pleasing\r\nto you, as it imports an approbation of your former conduct, whereon be\r\npleased to accept my congratulations. You will receive herewith, a letter\r\nfrom myself to Monsieur de Montmorin, closing your former mission, your\r\nnew commission, letters of credence from the President for the States\r\nGeneral and Stadtholder, sealed, and copies of them open for your own\r\nsatisfaction. You will keep the cypher we have heretofore used.\r\n\r\nYour past experience in the same line, renders it unnecessary for me\r\nto particularize your duties on closing your present, or conducting\r\nyour future mission. Harmony with our friends being our object, you are\r\nsensible how much it will be promoted by attention to the manner as well\r\nas the matter of your communications with the government of the United\r\nNetherlands. I feel myself particularly bound to recommend, as the most\r\nimportant of your charges, the patronage of our commerce and the extension\r\nof its privileges, both in the United Netherlands and their colonies, but\r\nmost especially the latter.\r\n\r\nThe allowance to a minister resident of the United States, is four\r\nthousand five hundred dollars a year, _for all his personal services and\r\nother expenses_, a year's salary for his outfit, and a quarter's salary\r\nfor his return. It is understood that the _personal services and other\r\nexpenses_ here meant, do not extend to the cost of gazettes and pamphlet's\r\ntransmitted to the Secretary of State's office, to translating or printing\r\nnecessary papers, postage, couriers, and necessary aids to poor American\r\nsailors. These additional charges, therefore, may be inserted in your\r\naccounts; but no other of any description, unless where they are expressly\r\ndirected to be incurred. The salary of your new grade being the same as\r\nof your former one, and your services continued, though the scene of\r\nthem is changed, there will be no intermission of salary; the new one\r\nbeginning where the former ends, and ending when you shall receive notice\r\nof your permission to return. For the same reason there can be but one\r\nallowance of outfit and return, the former to take place now, the latter\r\nonly on your final return. The funds appropriated to the support of the\r\nforeign establishment, do not admit the allowance of a secretary to a\r\nminister resident. I have thought it best to state these things to you\r\nminutely, that you may be relieved from all doubt as to the matter of\r\nyour accounts. I will beg leave to add a most earnest request, that on\r\nthe 1st day of July next, and on the same day annually afterwards, you\r\nmake out your account to that day, and send it by the first vessel, and by\r\nduplicates. In this I must be very urgent and particular; because at the\r\nmeeting of the ensuing Congress always, it is expected that I prepare for\r\nthem a statement of the disbursements from this fund, from July to June\r\ninclusive. I shall give orders by the first opportunity, to our bankers\r\nin Amsterdam, to answer your drafts for the allowances herein before\r\nmentioned, recruiting them at the same time by an adequate remitment; as\r\nI expect that by the time you receive this, they will not have remaining\r\non hand of this fund, more than seven or eight thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nYou shall receive from me, from time to time, the laws and journals of\r\nCongress, gazettes and other interesting papers: for whatever information\r\nis in possession of the public, I shall leave you generally to the\r\ngazettes, and only undertake to communicate by letter, such, relative to\r\nthe business of your mission, as the gazetteers cannot give. From you I\r\nshall ask, once or twice a month regularly, a communication of interesting\r\noccurrences in Holland, of the general affairs of Europe, and the regular\r\ntransmission of the Leyden gazette by every British packet, in the way\r\nit now comes, which proves to be very regular. Send also such other\r\npublications as may be important enough to be read by one who can spare\r\nlittle time to read anything, or which may contain matter proper to be\r\nturned to, on interesting subjects and occasions. The English packet is\r\nthe most certain channel for such epistolatory communications as are not\r\nvery secret, and by those packets I would wish always to receive a letter\r\nfrom you, by way of corrective to the farrago of news they generally\r\nbring. Intermediate letters, secret communications, gazettes, and other\r\nprinted papers, had better come by private vessels from Amsterdam; which\r\nchannel I shall use generally for my letters, and always for gazettes and\r\nother printed papers.\r\n\r\nThe President has also joined you in a special and temporary commission\r\nwith Mr. Carmichael to repair to Madrid, and there negotiate certain\r\nmatters respecting the navigation of the Mississippi, and other points\r\nof common interest between Spain and us. As some time will be necessary\r\nto make out the instructions and transcripts necessary in this business,\r\nthey can only be forwarded by some future occasion; but they shall be\r\nsoon forwarded, as we wish not to lose a moment in advancing negotiations\r\nso essential to our peace. For this reason, I must urge you to repair\r\nto the Hague at the earliest day the settlement of your affairs at Paris\r\nwill admit, that your reception may be over, and the idea of your being\r\nestablished there strengthened, before you receive the new orders.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sincere respect and esteem, dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, January 23, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I have the pleasure to inform you, that the President of the\r\nUnited States has appointed you Minister Plenipotentiary for the United\r\nStates, at the court of France, which was approved by the Senate on the\r\n12th instant; on which be pleased to accept my congratulations. You will\r\nreceive herewith your commission, a letter of credence for the King,\r\nsealed, and a copy of it open for your own satisfaction, as also a cypher,\r\nto be used on proper occasions in the correspondence between us.\r\n\r\nTo you, it would be more than unnecessary for me to undertake a general\r\ndelineation of the functions of the office to which you are appointed. I\r\nshall therefore only express our desire, that they be constantly exercised\r\nin that spirit of sincere friendship and attachment which we bear to the\r\nFrench nation; and that in all transactions with the minister, his good\r\ndispositions be conciliated by whatever in language or attentions may tend\r\nto that effect. With respect to their government, we are under no call to\r\nexpress opinions which might please or offend any party, and therefore it\r\nwill be best to avoid them on all occasions, public or private. Could any\r\ncircumstances require unavoidably such expressions, they would naturally\r\nbe in conformity with the sentiments of the great mass of our countrymen,\r\nwho, having first, in modern times, taken the ground of government\r\nfounded on the will of the people, cannot but be delighted on seeing so\r\ndistinguished and so esteemed a nation arrive on the same ground, and\r\nplant their standard by our side.\r\n\r\nI feel myself particularly bound to recommend, as the most important of\r\nyour charges, the patronage of our commerce, and the extension of its\r\nprivileges, both in France and her colonies, but most especially the\r\nlatter. Our consuls in France are under general instructions to correspond\r\nwith the minister of the United States at Paris; from them you may often\r\nreceive interesting information. Joseph Fenwick is consul at Bordeaux,\r\nand Burwell Carnes at Nantz; Monsieur de la Motte vice consul at Havre,\r\nand Monsieur Cathalan at Marseilles.\r\n\r\nAn act of Congress, of July the 1st, 1790, has limited the allowance of\r\na Minister Plenipotentiary to nine thousand dollars a year _for all his\r\npersonal services and other expenses_, a year's salary for his outfit, and\r\na quarter's salary for his return. It is understood that _the personal\r\nservices and other expenses_ here meant, do not extend to the cost of\r\ngazettes and pamphlets transmitted to the Secretary of State's office, to\r\ntranslating or printing necessary papers, postage, couriers, and necessary\r\naids to poor American sailors. These additional charges, therefore, may\r\nbe inserted in your accounts; but no other of any description, unless\r\nwhere they are expressly directed to be incurred. By an ancient rule of\r\nCongress, your salary will commence from the day you receive this letter,\r\nif you be then at Paris, or from the day you set out for Paris from any\r\nother place at which it may find you; it ceases on receiving notice or\r\npermission to return, after which the additional quarter's allowance\r\ntakes place. You are free to name your own private secretary, who will\r\nreceive from the public a salary of thirteen hundred and fifty dollars\r\na year, without allowance for any _extras_. I have thought it best to\r\nstate these things to you minutely, that you may be relieved from all\r\ndoubt as to the matter of your accounts. I will beg leave to add a most\r\nearnest request, that on the 1st day of July next, and on the same day\r\nannually afterwards, you make out your account to that day, and send it\r\nby the first vessel, and by duplicates. In this I must be very urgent\r\nand particular, because at the meeting of the ensuing Congress always,\r\nit is expected that I prepare for them a statement of the disbursements\r\nfrom this fund, from July to June inclusive. I shall give orders by the\r\nfirst opportunity to our bankers in Amsterdam, to answer your drafts for\r\nthe allowances herein before mentioned, recruiting them at the same time\r\nby an adequate remitment, as I expect that by the time you receive this,\r\nthey will not have remaining on hand of this fund more than seven or eight\r\nthousand dollars.\r\n\r\nYou shall receive from me, from time to time, the laws and journals of\r\nCongress, gazettes and other interesting papers; for whatever information\r\nis in possession of the public, I shall leave you generally to the\r\ngazettes, and only undertake to communicate by letter, such, relative to\r\nthe business of your mission, as the gazettes cannot give.\r\n\r\nFrom you I shall ask, once or twice a month regularly, a communication of\r\ninteresting occurrences in France, of the general affairs of Europe, and\r\ntransmission of the Leyden gazette, the _journal logographe_, and the best\r\npaper of Paris for their colonial affairs, with such other publications\r\nas may be important enough to be read by one who can spare little time\r\nto read anything, or which may contain matter proper to be turned to, on\r\ninteresting subjects and occasions. The English packet is the most certain\r\nchannel for such epistolary communications as are not very secret, and\r\nby those packets I would wish always to receive a letter from you by way\r\nof corrective to the farrago of news they generally bring. Intermediate\r\nletters, secret communications, gazettes and other printed papers, had\r\nbetter come through the channel of Monsieur de La Motte at Havre, to whom\r\nI shall also generally address my letters to you, and always the gazettes\r\nand other printed papers.\r\n\r\nMr. Short will receive by the same conveyance, his appointment as minister\r\nresident at the Hague.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem and respect, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, January 23, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--The President of the United States having destined Mr. Short to\r\nanother employment, he is instructed to take leave of the court of France.\r\nThe perfect knowledge I have of his understanding and dispositions, gives\r\nme full confidence that he has so conducted himself during his residence\r\nnear them, as to merit their approbation; and that he will mark his\r\ndeparture with those respectful attentions and assurances which will give\r\nthem entire satisfaction. Above all things, I hope that every exercise of\r\nhis functions has been consistent with the sincerity of the friendship we\r\nbear to the King and nation, and that you will be persuaded, that no one\r\nis more cordial in that sentiment than he who has the honor to be, with\r\nthe most profound respect and attachment, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DON JOSEPH JAUDENES, AND DON JOSEPH VIAR.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, January 25, 1792.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--Don Joseph Jaudenes having communicated to me verbally that\r\nhis Catholic Majesty had been apprised of our solicitude to have some\r\narrangements made respecting our free navigation of the Mississippi,\r\nand a port thereon convenient for the deposit of merchandize of export\r\nand import for lading and unlading the sea and river vessels, and that\r\nhis Majesty would be ready to enter into treaty thereon directly with\r\nus, whensoever we should send to Madrid a proper and acceptable person\r\nauthorized to treat on our part, I laid the communication before the\r\nPresident of the United States. I am authorized by him to assure you\r\nthat our government has nothing more at heart than to meet the friendly\r\nadvances of his Catholic Majesty with cordiality, and to concur in such\r\narrangements on the subject proposed, as may tend best to secure peace and\r\nfriendship between the two nations on a permanent footing. The President\r\nhas, therefore, with the approbation of the Senate, appointed Mr. Short,\r\nour present minister resident at the Hague, to proceed to Madrid as a\r\njoint commissioner with Mr. Carmichael, with full powers to treat on the\r\nsubject before mentioned, and I have no doubt that these gentlemen will\r\nso conduct themselves as to give entire satisfaction. Mr. Short's business\r\nat the Hague will occasion a short delay of his departure from that place\r\nfor Madrid, but he will be duly urged to make it as short as possible.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Gentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, January 28, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--My last private letter to you was of November 25th, your\r\nlast received was of September 29th. Though the present will be very\r\nconfidential, and will go, I do not know how, I cannot take time to\r\ncypher it all. What has lately occurred here will convince you I have\r\nbeen right in not raising your expectations as to an appointment. The\r\nPresident proposed at first the nomination of Mr. T. Pinckney to the court\r\nof London, but would not name him till we could have an assurance from\r\nhim that he would accept, nor did he indicate what the other appointments\r\nwould be till Mr. Pinckney's answer came. Then he nominated to the Senate\r\nMr. Morris, M. P. for France, Pinckney, M. P. for London, and yourself M.\r\nR. for the Hague. The first of these appointments was extremely unpopular,\r\nand so little relished by several of the Senate, that every effort\r\nwas used to negative it. Those whose personal objections to Mr. Morris\r\noverruled their deference to the President, finding themselves a minority,\r\njoined with another small party who are against all foreign appointments,\r\nand endeavored with them to put down the whole system rather than let this\r\narticle pass. This plan was defeated, and Mr. Morris passed by a vote\r\nof 16 against 11. When your nomination came on, it was consented to, by\r\n15 against 11, every man of the latter, however, rising and declaring,\r\nthat as to yourself they had no personal objection, but only meant by\r\ntheir vote to declare their opinion against keeping any person at the\r\nHague. Those who voted in the negative were not exactly the same in both\r\ncases. When the biennial bill furnishing money for the support of the\r\nforeign establishment shall come up at the next session, to be continued,\r\nthe same contest will arise again, and I think it very possible that if\r\nthe opponents of Mr. Morris cannot remove him otherwise, they will join\r\nagain with those who are against the whole establishment, and try to\r\ndiscontinue the whole. If they fail in this, I still see no security in\r\ntheir continuing the mission to the Hague; because to do this they must\r\nenlarge the fund from forty to fifty thousand dollars. The President\r\nafterwards proceeded to join you to Carmichael on a special mission to\r\nSpain, to which there was no opposition, except from three gentlemen who\r\nwere against opening the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere attachment, dear Sir, your affectionate friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n                                                         February --, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I return you the report on the mint, which I have read over\r\nwith a great deal of satisfaction. I concur with you in thinking that\r\nthe unit must stand on both metals, that the alloy should be the same in\r\nboth, also in the proportion you establish between the value of the two\r\nmetals. As to the question on whom the expense of coinage is to fall, I\r\nhave been so little able to make up an opinion satisfactory to myself,\r\nas to be ready to concur in either decision. With respect to the dollar,\r\nit must be admitted by all the world, that there is great incertainty in\r\nthe meaning of the term, and therefore all the world will have justified\r\nCongress for their first act of removing the incertainty by declaring\r\nwhat they understand by the term, but the incertainty once removed,\r\nexists no longer, and I very much doubt a right now to change the value,\r\nand especially to lessen it. It would lead to so easy a mode of paying\r\noff their debts. Besides, the parties injured by this reduction of the\r\nvalue would have so much matter to urge in support of the first point of\r\nfixation. Should it be thought, however, that Congress may reduce the\r\nvalue of the dollar, I should be for adopting for our unit, instead of\r\nthe dollar, either one ounce of pure silver, or one ounce of standard\r\nsilver, so as to keep the unit of money a part of the system of measures,\r\nweights and coins. I hazard these thoughts to you extempore and am, dear\r\nSir, respectfully and affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, February 2, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--On the receipt of your letter of the 14th of December, I\r\ncommunicated it to the President of the United States, and under the\r\nsanction of his authority, the principal members of the executive\r\ndepartment made it their duty to make known in conversations generally,\r\nthe explicit disclaimer, in the name of your court, which you had been\r\npleased to give us, that the government of Canada had supported or\r\nencouraged the hostilities of our Indian neighbors in the western country.\r\nYour favor of January the 30th, to the same purpose, has been, in like\r\nmanner, communicated to the President, and I am authorized to assure you,\r\nthat he is duly sensible of this additional proof of the disposition of\r\nthe court of London, to confine the proceedings of their officers in our\r\nvicinage within the limits of friendship and good neighborhood, and that a\r\nconduct so friendly and just, will furnish us a motive the more for those\r\nduties and good offices which neighbor nations owe each other.\r\n\r\nYou have seen too much, Sir, of the conduct of the press in countries\r\nwhere it is free, to consider the gazettes as evidence of the sentiments\r\nof any part of the government; you have seen them bestow on the government\r\nitself, in all its parts, its full share of inculpation. Of the sentiments\r\nof our government on the subject of your letter, I cannot give you better\r\nevidence than the statement of the causes of the Indian war, made by the\r\nSecretary of War on the 26th of the last month, by order of the President,\r\nand inserted in the public papers. No interference on the part of your\r\nnation is therein stated among the causes of the war. I am happy, however,\r\nin the hope, that a due execution of the treaty will shortly silence those\r\nexpressions of public feeling by removing their cause. I have the honor\r\nto be, with great respect and esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, February 4, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--The late appointment of a Minister Resident to the Hague, has\r\nbrought under consideration the condition of Mr. Dumas, and the question,\r\nwhether he is, or is not, at present in the service of the United States?\r\n\r\nMr. Dumas, very early in the war, was employed first by Dr. Franklin,\r\nafterwards by Mr. Adams, to transact the affairs of the United States\r\nin Holland. Congress never passed any express vote of confirmation, but\r\nthey opened a direct correspondence with Mr. Dumas, sent him orders to\r\nbe executed, confirmed and augmented his salary, made that augmentation\r\nretrospective, directed him to take up his residence in their hotel at the\r\nHague, and passed such other votes from time to time as established him\r\n_de facto_ their agent at the Hague. On the change in the organization of\r\nour government in 1789, no commission nor new appointment took place with\r\nrespect to him, though it did in most other cases; yet the correspondence\r\nwith him from the office of Foreign Affairs has been continued, and he\r\nhas regularly received his salary. A doubt has been suggested, whether\r\nthis be legal. I have myself no doubt but what it is legal. I consider\r\nthe source of authority with us to be the Nation. Their will, declared\r\nthrough its proper organ, is valid, till revoked by their will declared\r\nthrough its proper organ again also. Between 1776 and 1789, the proper\r\norgan for pronouncing their will, whether legislative or executive, was a\r\nCongress formed in a particular manner. Since 1789 it is a Congress formed\r\nin a different manner, for laws, and a President, elected in a particular\r\nway, for making appointments and doing other executive acts. The laws\r\nand appointments of the ancient Congress were as valid and permanent in\r\ntheir nature, as the laws of the new Congress, or appointments of the new\r\nExecutive; these laws and appointments, in both cases deriving equally\r\ntheir source from the will of the nation; and when a question arises,\r\nwhether any particular law or appointment is still in force, we are to\r\nexamine, not whether it was pronounced by the ancient or present organ,\r\nbut whether it has been at any time revoked by the authority of the\r\nnation, expressed by the organ competent at the time. The nation, by the\r\nact of their federal convention, established some new principles and some\r\nnew organizations of the government. This was a valid declaration of their\r\nwill, and _ipso facto_ revoked some laws before passed, and discontinued\r\nsome officers and offices before appointed. Wherever, by this instrument,\r\nan old office was suspended by a new one, a new appointment became\r\nnecessary; but where the new Constitution did not demolish an office,\r\neither expressly or virtually, nor the President remove the officer, both\r\nthe office and officer remained. This was the case of several; in many\r\nof them, indeed, an excess of caution dictated the superaddition of a new\r\nappointment; but where there was no such superaddition, as in the instance\r\nof Mr. Dumas, both the office and officer still remained: for the will\r\nof the nation, validly pronounced by the proper organ of the day, had\r\nconstituted him their agent, and that will has not, through any of its\r\nsuccessive organs, revoked its appointment. I think, therefore, there is\r\nno room to doubt its continuance, and that the receipt of salary by him\r\nhas been lawful.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would not wish to take on myself alone the decision of a\r\nquestion so important, whether considered in a legal or constitutional\r\nview; and therefore submit it to you, Sir, whether it is not a proper\r\nquestion whereon to take the opinion of the Attorney General?\r\n\r\nAnother question then arises, Ought Mr. Dumas to be discontinued? I am of\r\nopinion he ought not.\r\n\r\n1. Not at this time; because Mr. Short's mission to Madrid will occasion\r\nan immediate vacancy at the Hague again; and because, by the time\r\nthat will be over, his appointment at the Hague must be discontinued\r\naltogether, unless Congress should enlarge the foreign fund.\r\n\r\n2. Not at any time; because, when, after the peace, Mr. Dumas' agency\r\nbecame of less importance, Congress, under various views of his\r\nsacrifices and services, manifested that their continuance of him was\r\nin consideration of these, and of his advanced years and infirm state,\r\nwhich render it impossible for him to launch into a new line of gaining\r\na livelihood; and they thought the continuance of moderate competence to\r\nhim for moderate services, was more honorable to the United States than\r\nto abandon him in the face of Europe, after and under such circumstances.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most profound respect and\r\nattachment. Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, February 7, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--An account presented to me by Mr. John B. Cutting, for expenditures\r\nincurred by him in liberating the seamen of the United States in British\r\nports, during the impressments, which took place under that government in\r\nthe year 1790, obliges me to recall some former transactions to your mind.\r\n\r\nYou will be pleased to recollect the numerous instances of complaint\r\nor information to us, about that time, of the violence committed on our\r\nseafaring citizens in British ports, by their press-gangs and officers,\r\nand that, not having even a consul there at that time, it was thought\r\nfortunate that a private citizen, who happened to be on the spot, stept\r\nforward for their protection; that it was obvious that these exertions\r\non his part must be attended with expense, and that a particular demand\r\nof fifty pounds sterling for this purpose coming incidentally to my\r\nknowledge, it was immediately remitted to Mr. Cutting, with a request\r\nto account for it in convenient time. He now presents an account of all\r\nhis expenditures in this business, which I have the honor to communicate\r\nherewith. According to this, the oppression extends to a much greater\r\nnumber of our citizens, and their relief is more costly, than had\r\nbeen contemplated. It will be necessary to lay the account before the\r\nLegislature; because, the expenses being of a description which had not\r\noccurred before, no appropriation heretofore made would authorize payment\r\nat the treasury; because, too, the nature of the transactions may in some\r\ninstances require, justly, that the ordinary rules of evidence, which the\r\nAuditor is bound to apply to ordinary cases, should suffer relaxations,\r\nwhich he probably will not think himself authorized to admit, without the\r\norders of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe practice in Great Britain of impressing seamen whenever war is\r\napprehended, will fall more heavily on ours than on those of any other\r\nforeign nation, on account of the sameness of language. Our minister at\r\nthat court, therefore, will, on these occasions, be under the necessity of\r\ninterfering for their protection, in a way which will call for expense.\r\nIt is desirable that these expenses should be reduced to certain rules,\r\nas far as the nature of the case will admit, and the sooner they are so\r\nreduced the better. This may be done, however, on surer grounds after\r\nthe government of Great Britain shall have entered with us into these\r\narrangements on this particular subject which the seriousness of the case\r\ncalls for on our part, and its difficulty may admit on theirs. This done,\r\nit will be desirable that legislative rules be framed which may equally\r\nguide and justify the proceedings of our minister, or other agent, at\r\nthat court, and at the same time extend to our seafaring citizens the\r\nprotection of which they have so much need.\r\n\r\nMr. Cutting, being on the spot, will himself furnish the explanations and\r\ndocuments of his case, either to the legislature or a committee of it, or\r\nto the Auditor, as he shall be required.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, February 25, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have now the honor to enclose you the answer of the Attorney\r\nGeneral to a letter I wrote him on the subject of yours of the 18th\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the judges of the Supreme Court of the United States are\r\nopen to the application of Mr. Pagan for a writ of error to revise his\r\ncase. This writ is to be granted, indeed, or refused, at the discretion\r\nof the judge; but the discretion of a judge is governed by the rules of\r\nlaw; if these be in favor of Mr. Pagan's application, his case will be\r\nreviewed in the Supreme Court, and the decision against him corrected, if\r\nwrong; if these be against his application, he will then be at the end of\r\nthe ordinary course of law, at which term alone it is usual for nations to\r\ntake up the clause of an individual, and to inquire whether their judges\r\nhave refused him justice. At present, therefore, I am not able to say\r\nmore, than that the judges of the Supreme Court of the United States will\r\nreceive Mr. Pagan's application for a writ of error to revise the judgment\r\ngiven against him by the inferior court, and that there can be no doubt\r\nthey will do on that application what shall be right.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest esteem, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. JOHNSON, CARROL, AND STEWART.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, March 6, 1792.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--It having been found impracticable to employ Major L'Enfant\r\nabout the federal city, in that degree of subordination which was lawful\r\nand proper, he has been notified that his services are at an end. It is\r\nnow proper that he should receive the reward of his past services; and\r\nthe wish that he should have no just cause of discontent, suggests that\r\nit should be liberal. The President thinks of two thousand five hundred,\r\nor three thousand dollars: but leaves the determination to you. Ellicott\r\nis to go on, the week after the next, to finish laying off the plan on\r\nthe ground, and surveying and platting the district. I have remonstrated\r\nwith him on the excess of five dollars a day and his expenses, and he\r\nhas proposed striking off the latter; but this also is left to you, and\r\nto make the allowance retrospective. He is fully apprised that he is\r\nentirely under your orders, and there will be no person employed but under\r\nyour orders. The enemies of this enterprise will take advantage of the\r\nretirement of L'Enfant, to trumpet an abortion of the whole. This will\r\nrequire double exertions, to be counteracted. I enclose you the project\r\nof a loan which is agreed on, if you approve it. Your answer will be\r\nimmediately expected, and is kept entirely secret, till the subscriptions\r\nare actually opened. With this money, in aid of your other funds, the\r\nworks may be pushed with such spirit as to evince to the world that they\r\nwill not be relaxed.\r\n\r\nThe immediate employment of a superintendent, of activity and intelligence\r\nequal to the nature of his functions and the public expectations, becomes\r\nimportant. You will, doubtless, also consider it as necessary to advertise\r\nimmediately for plans of the Capitol and President's house. The sketch\r\nof an advertisement for the plan of a Capitol, which Mr. Johnson had sent\r\nto the President, is now returned with some alterations, and one also for\r\na President's house. Both of them are subject to your pleasure, and when\r\naccommodated to that, if you will return them, they shall be advertised\r\nhere and elsewhere. The President thinks it of primary importance to press\r\nthe providing as great quantities of brick, stone, lime, plank, timber,\r\n&c., this year as possible. It will occur to you that the stone should be\r\ngot by a skilful hand. Knowing what will be your funds, you will be able\r\nto decide which of the following works had better be undertaken for the\r\npresent year.\r\n\r\n    The cellars of both houses.\r\n    The foundations of one, or both.\r\n    Bridge over Rock Creek, and the post road brought over it.\r\n    Canal.\r\n    Wharves.\r\n\r\nThe affair of Mr. Carrol, of Duddington's house, seems to call for\r\nsettlement. The President thinks the most just course would be, to rebuild\r\nthe house in the same degree, using the same materials as far as they will\r\ngo, and supplying what are destroyed or rendered unfit; so that the effect\r\nwill be in fact, only the removal of the house within his lot, and in a\r\nposition square with the streets. Do you not think it would be expedient\r\nto take measures for importing a number of Germans and Highlanders? This\r\nneed not be to such an extent as to prevent the employment of eastern\r\nlaborers, which is eligible for particular reasons. If you approve of the\r\nimportation of Germans and have a good channel for it, you will use it, of\r\ncourse. If you have no channel, I can help you to one. Though Roberdeau's\r\nconduct has been really blamable, yet we suppose the principal object of\r\nthe arrest was to remove him off the ground. As the prosecution of him\r\nto judgment might give room to misrepresentation of the motives, perhaps\r\nyou may think it not amiss to discontinue the proceedings. You will\r\nreceive herewith a packet of papers, among which are several projects and\r\nestimates which have been given in by different persons, and which are\r\nhanded on to you, not as by any means carrying with them any degree of\r\napprobation, but merely, that if you find anything good in them, you may\r\nconvert it to some account. Some of these contain the views of L'Enfant.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect,\r\ngentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 10, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--My letter of January the 23d, put under cover to Mr. Johnson\r\nin London, and sent by a passenger in the British packet of February,\r\nwill have conveyed to you your appointment as Minister Plenipotentiary of\r\nthe United States, at the court of France. By the Pennsylvania, Captain\r\nHarding, bound to Havre de Grace, and plying pretty regularly between\r\nthis place and that, you will receive the present letter, with the laws\r\nof the United States, journals of Congress, and gazettes to this day,\r\naddressed to the care of M. de la Motte. You will also receive a letter\r\nfrom the President to the King of France, in answer to his announcing\r\nthe acceptance of the Constitution, which came to hand only a week ago.\r\nA copy of this letter is sent for your own use. You will be pleased to\r\ndeliver the sealed one, (to the minister, I presume, according to the\r\nancient etiquette of the court,) accompanying it with the assurances\r\nof friendship, which the occasion may permit you to express, and which\r\nare cordially felt by the President and the great body of our nation.\r\nWe wish no occasion to be omitted of impressing the National Assembly\r\nwith this truth. We had expected, ere this, that in consequence of the\r\nrecommendation of their predecessors, some overtures would have been made\r\nto us on the subject of a treaty of commerce. An authentic copy of the\r\nrecommendation was delivered, but nothing said about carrying it into\r\neffect. Perhaps they expect that we should declare our readiness to meet\r\nthem on the ground of treaty. If they do, we have no hesitation to declare\r\nit. In the meantime, if the present communications produce any sensation,\r\nperhaps it may furnish a good occasion to endeavor to have matters\r\nre-placed _in statu quo_, by repealing the late innovations as to our\r\nships, tobacco and whale oil. It is right that things should be on their\r\nancient footing, at opening the treaty. M. Ternant has applied here for\r\nfour thousand dollars for the succor of the French colonies. The Secretary\r\nof the Treasury has reason to believe, that the late loan at Antwerp has\r\npaid up all our arrearages to France, both of principal and interest,\r\nand consequently, that there is no part of our debt exigible at this\r\ntime. However, the Legislature having authorized the President to proceed\r\nin borrowing to pay off the residue, provided it can be done to the\r\n_advantage_ of the United States, it is thought the law will be satisfied\r\nwith _avoiding loss_ to the United States. This has obliged the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury to require some conditions, which may remove from us that\r\nloss which we encountered, from an unfavorable exchange, to pay what was\r\n_exigible_, and transfer it to France as to payments not exigible. These\r\nshall be fully detailed to you when settled. In the meantime, the money\r\nwill be furnished as far as it can be done. Indeed, our wishes are cordial\r\nfor the re-establishment of peace and commerce in those colonies, and to\r\ngive such proofs of our good faith both to them and the mother country,\r\nas to suppress all that jealousy which might oppose itself to the free\r\nexchange of our _mutual productions_, so essential to the prosperity of\r\nthose colonies, and to the preservation of _our agricultural_ interest.\r\nThis is our true interest and our true object, and we have no reason to\r\nconceal views so justifiable, though the expression of them may require\r\nthat the occasions be proper and the terms chosen with delicacy. The\r\ngazettes will inform you of the proceedings of Congress, the laws passed\r\nand proposed, and generally speaking, of all public transactions. You\r\nwill perceive that the Indian war calls for sensible exertions. It would\r\nhave been a trifle had we only avowed enemies to contend with. The British\r\ncourt have disavowed all aid to the Indians. Whatever may have been their\r\norders in that direction, the Indians are fully and notoriously supplied\r\nby their agents with everything necessary to carry on the war. Time will\r\nshow how all this is to end. Besides the laws, journals and newspapers,\r\nbefore mentioned, you will receive herewith the State constitutions, the\r\ncensus and almanac, and an answer to Lord Sheffield on our commerce. A\r\ncypher is ready for you, but cannot be sent till we can find a trusty\r\npassenger going to Paris.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect and esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince writing the preceding, the two Houses have come to resolutions on\r\nthe King's letter, which are enclosed in the President's, and copies of\r\nthem accompany this for your use.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. CARMICHAEL AND SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 18, 1792.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--The President having thought proper to appoint you joint\r\ncommissioners plenipotentiary, on the part of the United States, to\r\ntreat with the court of Madrid on the subjects of the navigation of the\r\nMississippi, arrangements on our limits, and commerce, you will herewith\r\nreceive your commission; as also observations on these several subjects,\r\nreported to the President and approved by him, which will therefore\r\nserve as instructions for you. These expressing minutely the sense of our\r\ngovernment and what they wish to have done, it is unnecessary for me to\r\ndo more here than desire you to pursue these objects unremittingly, and\r\nendeavor to bring them to an issue in the course of the ensuing summer.\r\nIt is desirable that you should keep an exact journal of what shall pass\r\nbetween yourselves and the court or their negotiator, and communicate it\r\nfrom time to time to me, that your progress and prospects may be known.\r\nYou will be the best judges whether to send your letters by Lisbon, Cadiz,\r\nor what other route; but we shall be anxious to hear from you as often\r\nas possible. If no safe conveyance occurs from Madrid to Lisbon, and\r\nyour matter should be of importance sufficient to justify the expense, a\r\ncourier must be sent; but do not incur the expense unless it be to answer\r\nsome good end.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, Gentlemen, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 18, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--You will receive herewith a commission appointing Mr. Carmichael and\r\nyourself joint commissioners plenipotentiary for treating on the subject\r\ntherein expressed with the Court of Madrid; to which place it is necessary\r\nof course that you repair. The instructions and other papers accompanying\r\nthe commission, (and of which no duplicate is hazarded,) leave nothing\r\nto be added here but to express the desire that this object be pursued\r\nimmediately. It is hoped that in consequence of my former letter you\r\nwill have made the necessary arrangements for an immediate departure on\r\nyour receipt of this. You will of course apprise the Court at the Hague\r\nin the most respectful and friendly manner, that matters of high moment\r\ncommitted to you, oblige you to a temporary absence. You will then be\r\npleased to proceed by such route as you think best to Madrid, taking care\r\nto furnish yourself from the representative of Spain at the Hague, or\r\nParis, with such letters or passports as may ensure your papers from being\r\ntaken out of your possession, or searched. You will judge from existing\r\ncircumstances whether, when you approach the limits of Spain, it may not\r\nbe prudent for you to ascertain previously that you will be permitted to\r\npass unsearched. When arrived at Madrid, the other papers before mentioned\r\nmark out the line to be pursued. I am, with great and sincere esteem, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 18, 1792.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir,--I shall not repeat in this private dispatch anything said\r\nin the public ones sent herewith. I have avoided saying in them what\r\nyou are to do, when the business you go on shall be finished or become\r\ndesperate, because I hope to hear what you wish. It is decided that\r\nCarmichael will be permitted to come away at that precise epoch, so you\r\nneed have no delicacy on that subject, if you chose to remain there in\r\nyour present grade. I become more and more satisfied that the Legislature\r\nwill refuse the money for continuing any _diplomatic_ character at the\r\nHague. I hope you will consider success in the object you go on, as the\r\nmost important one of your life: that you will meditate the matter day\r\nand night, and make yourself thoroughly master of it, in every possible\r\nform they may force you to discuss it. A former letter has apprised you\r\nof my private intentions at the close of the present federal cycle. My\r\nsuccessor and his dispositions are equally unknown. The administration\r\nmay change then in other of its parts. It is essential that this business\r\nbe completed before any idea of these things get abroad. Otherwise Spain\r\nmay delay in hopes of a change of consuls here. It will be a great comfort\r\nto leave this business safely and amicably settled, which has so long and\r\nimmediately threatened our peace. Gardoqui will probably be the negotiator\r\non their part. No attentions should be spared towards him, or the Count\r\nFlorida Blanca. Let what will be said or done, preserve your _sang froid_\r\nimmovably, and to every obstacle, oppose patience, perseverance, and\r\nsoothing language. Pardon my sermonizing; it proceeds from the interest\r\nI feel in this business, and in your success. It will be well that you\r\nexamine with the most minute attention all the circumstances which may\r\nenable you to judge and communicate to us whether the situation of Spain\r\nadmits her to go to war.\r\n\r\nThe failure of some stock gamblers and some other circumstances, have\r\nbrought the public paper low. The 6 per cents have fallen from 26 to\r\n21 1-4, and bank stock from 115 or 120 to 73 or 74, within two or\r\nthree weeks. This nefarious business is becoming more and more the\r\npublic detestation, and cannot fail, when the knowledge of it shall be\r\nsufficiently extended, to tumble its authors headlong from their heights.\r\nMoney is leaving the remoter parts of the Union, and flowing to this place\r\nto purchase paper; and here, a paper medium supplying its place, it is\r\nshipped off in exchange for luxuries. The value of property is necessarily\r\nfalling in the places left bare of money. In Virginia, for instance,\r\nproperty has fallen 25 per cent. in the last twelve months. I wish to God\r\nyou had some person who could dispose of your paper at a judicious moment\r\nfor you, and invest it in good lands. I would do anything my duty would\r\npermit, but were I to advise your agent (who is himself a stock dealer)\r\nto sell out yours at this or that moment, it would be used as a signal to\r\nguide speculations. There can never be a fear but that the paper which\r\nrepresents the public debt will be ever sacredly good. The public faith\r\nis bound for this, and no change of system will ever be permitted to\r\ntouch this; but no other paper stands on ground equally sure. I am glad\r\ntherefore that yours is all of this kind.\r\n\r\nSome bishop of Spain, who was for some time in Mexico, found there copies\r\nof Cortez's correspondence, and on his return to Spain, published them.\r\nI have made many efforts to get this book, but in vain. I must beg of\r\nyou to procure it for me while there. It is not many years since it was\r\npublished. I am, with constant and sincere attachment, dear Sir, your\r\naffectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. DE VIAR AND DE JAUDENES.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 23, 1792.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--I have the honor to inform you that a commission has been\r\nissued to Mr. Carmichael and Mr. Short, as Commissioners Plenipotentiary\r\nfor the United States, to confer, treat, and negotiate with any person\r\nor persons duly authorized by his Catholic Majesty, of and concerning\r\nthe navigation of the river Mississippi, and such other matters relative\r\nto the confines of their territories, and the intercourse to be had\r\nthereon, as the mutual interests and general harmony of neighboring and\r\nfriendly nations require should be precisely adjusted and regulated, and\r\nof and concerning the general commerce between the United States and the\r\nkingdom and dominions of his Catholic Majesty; and to conclude and sign\r\na treaty or treaties, convention or conventions thereon, saving as usual\r\nthe right of ratification, which commission is already on its way to Mr.\r\nShort, whom it will find at the Hague, and who is desired immediately\r\nto proceed to Madrid. I expect his route will be by Bordeaux, and thence\r\nacross the Pyrenees by the usual road. Might I hope your application to\r\nyour Court to send a passport and proper orders to their officers, where\r\nhe must first enter the kingdom, to protect his passage into and through\r\nthe kingdom, in order to prevent loss of time, which would be incurred by\r\nhis waiting there till he could ask and receive a passport from Madrid?\r\nWith the sincerest wishes that the matters not yet settled between the\r\ntwo countries may be so adjusted as to give a free course to that conduct\r\non both sides which an unity of interest evidently prescribes, and with\r\nsentiments of perfect esteem and respect for yourselves, I have the honor\r\nto be, Gentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL PICKERING.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 28, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--The President has desired me to confer with you on the proposition\r\nI made the other day, of endeavoring to move the posts at the rate of one\r\nhundred miles a day. It is believed to be practicable here, because it is\r\npractised in every other country. The difference of expense alone appeared\r\nto produce doubts with you on the subject. If you have no engagement\r\nfor dinner to-day, and will do me the favor to come and dine with me, we\r\nwill be entirely alone, and it will give us time to go over the matter\r\nand weigh it thoroughly. I will, in that case, ask the favor of you to\r\nfurnish yourself with such notes as may ascertain the present expense of\r\nthe posts, for one day in the week, to Boston and Richmond, and enable us\r\nto calculate the savings which may be made by availing ourselves of the\r\nstages. Be pleased to observe that the stages travel all the day. There\r\nseems nothing necessary for us then, but to hand the mail along through\r\nthe night till it may fall in with another stage the next day, if motives\r\nof economy should oblige us to be thus attentive to small savings. If\r\na little latitude of expense can be allowed, I should be for only using\r\nthe stages the first day, and then have our riders. I am anxious that the\r\nthing should be begun by way of experiment, for a short distance, because\r\nI believe it will so increase the income of the post-office as to show we\r\nmay go through with it. I shall hope to see you at three o'clock.\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 31, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--I received yesterday your favor of the day before, and immediately\r\nlaid it before the President of the United States. I have it in charge\r\nfrom him to express to you the perfect satisfaction which these assurances\r\non the part of your court have given him, that Bowles, who is the\r\nsubject of them, is an unauthorized impostor. The promptitude of their\r\ndisavowal of what their candor had forbidden him to credit, is a new\r\nproof of their friendly dispositions, and a fresh incitement to us to\r\ncherish corresponding sentiments. To these we are led both by interest\r\nand inclination, and I am authorized to assure you that no occasion will\r\nbe omitted on our part, of manifesting their sincerity. I have the honor\r\nto be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, April 1, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--Your letter of January the 8th to the President of the United\r\nStates, having been referred to me, I have given the subject of it as\r\nmature consideration as I am able. Two neighboring and free governments,\r\nwith laws equally mild and just, would find no difficulty in forming\r\na convention for the interchange of fugitive criminals. Nor would two\r\nneighboring despotic governments, with laws of equal severity. The latter\r\nwish that no door should be opened to their subjects flying from the\r\noppression of their laws. The fact is, that most of the governments on the\r\ncontinent of Europe have such conventions; but England, the only free one\r\ntill lately, has never yet consented either to enter into a convention\r\nfor this purpose, or to give up a fugitive. The difficulty between a\r\nfree government and a despotic one, is indeed great. I have the honor to\r\nenclose to your Excellency a sketch of the considerations which occurred\r\nto me on the subject, and which I laid before the President. He has, in\r\nconsequence, instructed me to prepare a project of a convention, to be\r\nproposed to the court of Madrid, which I have accordingly done, and now\r\nenclose a copy of it. I wish it may appear to you satisfactory. Against\r\nproperty we may hope it would be effectual; whilst it leaves a door\r\nopen to life and liberty except in a single unquestionable case. Messrs.\r\nCarmichael and Short will be instructed to make this one of the subjects\r\nof their negotiation with the court of Spain.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, your Excellency's most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMISSIONERS OF WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, April 9, 1792.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--In a former letter I enclosed you an idea of Mr. Lee's for an\r\nimmediate appropriation of a number of lots to raise a sum of money for\r\nerecting a national monument in the city of Washington. It was scarcely\r\nto be doubted but that you would avoid appropriations for matters of\r\nornament till a sufficient sum should be secured out of the proceeds of\r\nyour sales to accomplish the public buildings, bridges and other such\r\nobjects as are essential. Mr. Caracchi, the artist, who had proposed to\r\nexecute the monument, has had hopes that a subscription set on foot for\r\nthat purpose, would have sufficed to effect it. That hope is now over,\r\nand he is about to return to Europe. He is unquestionably an artist of\r\nthe first class. He has had the advantage of taking the model of the\r\nPresident's person in plaster, equal to every wish in resemblance and\r\nspirit. It is pretty certain that the equestrian statue of the President\r\ncan never be executed by an equal workman, who has had equal advantages,\r\nand the question is whether a prudent caution will permit you to enter\r\ninto any engagement now, taking time enough before the term of payment to\r\nhave accomplished the more material objects of the public buildings, &c.\r\nHe says to execute the equestrian statue, with the cost of the materials,\r\nin marble, will be worth 20,000 guineas; that he would begin it on his\r\nreturn, if four or five years hence you can engage to pay him 20,000\r\ndollars, and the same sum annually afterwards, till the whole is paid,\r\nbefore which time the statue shall be ready. It is rather probable that\r\nwithin some time Congress would take it off your hands, in compliance\r\nwith an ancient vote of that body. The questions for your considerations\r\nare, whether, supposing no difficulty as to the means, you think such a\r\nwork might be undertaken by you? Whether you can have so much confidence\r\nin the productiveness of your funds as to engage for a residuum of this\r\namount, all more necessary objects being first secured, and that this may\r\nbe within the time before proposed? and, in fine, which will preponderate\r\nin your minds, the hazard of undertaking this now, or that of losing the\r\naid of this artist? The nature of this proposition will satisfy you that\r\nit has not been communicated to the President, and of course would not\r\nbe, unless a previous acceptance on your part, should render it necessary\r\nto obtain his sanction. Your answer is necessary for the satisfaction of\r\nMr. Caracchi, at whose instance I submit the proposal to you, and who, I\r\nbelieve, will only wait here the return of that answer. I have the honor\r\nto be, with the most perfect esteem, gentlemen, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL N. LEWIS.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, April 12, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Unremitting business must be my apology, as it is really\r\nthe true one, for my having been longer without writing to you than my\r\naffections dictated. I am never a day without wishing myself with you,\r\nand more and more as the fine sunshine comes on, which was made for all\r\nthe world but me. Congress will rise about the 21st. They have passed\r\nthe Representation bill at one for thirty-three thousand, which gives\r\nto Virginia nineteen members. They have voted an army of five thousand\r\nmen, and the President has given the command to General Wayne, with four\r\nbrigadiers, to wit, Morgan, Brooks, Willet and Wilkinson. Congress is\r\nnow engaged on the ways and means of raising money to pay this army. A\r\nfurther assumption of State debt has been proposed by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, which has been rejected by a small majority; but the chickens of\r\nthe treasury have so many contrivances, and are so indefatigable within\r\ndoors and without, that we all fear they will get it in yet some way or\r\nother. As the doctrine is that a public debt is a public blessing, so they\r\nthink a perpetual one is a perpetual blessing, and therefore wish to make\r\nit so large that we can never pay it off. Your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, April 13, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have the honor to lay before you a communication from Mr.\r\nHammond, Minister Plenipotentiary of his Britannic Majesty, covering a\r\nclause of a statute of that country relative to its commerce with us,\r\nand notifying a determination to carry it into execution henceforward.\r\nConceiving that the determination announced could not be really meant as\r\nextensively as the words import, I asked and received an explanation from\r\nthe minister, as expressed in the letter and answer herein enclosed; and\r\non consideration of all circumstances, I cannot but confide in the opinion\r\nexpressed by him, that its sole object is to exclude foreign vessels from\r\nthe Islands of Jersey and Guernsey. The want of proportion between the\r\nmotives expressed and the measure, its magnitude and consequences, total\r\nsilence as to the proclamation on which the intercourse between the two\r\ncountries has hitherto hung, and of which, in this broad sense, it would\r\nbe a revocation, and the recent manifestations of the disposition of\r\nthat government to concur with this in mutual offices of friendship and\r\ngood will, support his construction. The minister, moreover, assured me\r\nverbally, that he would immediately write to his court for an explanation,\r\nand in the meantime, is of opinion that the usual intercourse of commerce\r\nbetween the two countries (Jersey and Guernsey excepted) need not be\r\nsuspended.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most profound respect and\r\nattachment Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. CARMICHAEL AND SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, April 24, 1792.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--My letter of March the 18th, conveyed to you full powers for\r\ntreating with Spain on the subjects therein expressed. Since that, our\r\nattention has been drawn to the case of fugitive debtors and criminals,\r\nwhereon it is always well that coterminous States should understand one\r\nanother, as far as their ideas on the rightful powers of government can be\r\nmade to go together. Where they separate, the cases may be left unprovided\r\nfor. The enclosed paper, approved by the President, will explain to\r\nyou how far we can go, in an agreement with Spain _for her territories\r\nbordering on us_; and the plan of a convention is there stated. You are\r\ndesired to propose the matter to that court, and establish with them so\r\nmuch of it as they approve, filling up the blank for the manner of the\r\ndemand by us and compliance with them, in such a way, as their laws and\r\nthe organization of their government may require. But recollect that\r\nthey bound on us between two and three thousand miles, and consequently,\r\nthat they should authorize a delivery by some description of officers\r\nto be found on every inhabitable part of their border. We have thought\r\nit best to agree, specially, the manner of proceeding _in our country_,\r\non a demand of theirs, because the convention will in that way execute\r\nitself, without the necessity of a new law for the purpose. Your general\r\npowers being comprehensive enough to take in this subject, no new ones\r\nare issued.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Gentlemen, your most obedient,\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The annexed are the papers referred to in the preceding.]\r\n\r\n_Project of a convention with the Spanish provinces._\r\n\r\nAny person having committed murder or malice prepense, not of the nature\r\nof treason, within the United States or the Spanish provinces adjoining\r\nthereto, and fleeing from the justice of the country, shall be delivered\r\nup by the government where he shall be found, to that from which he fled,\r\nwhenever demanded by the same.\r\n\r\nThe manner of the demand by the Spanish government, and of the compliance\r\nby that of the United States, shall be as follows. The person authorized\r\nby the Spanish government where the murder was committed, to pursue the\r\nfugitive, may apply to any justice of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, or to the district judge of the place where the fugitive is,\r\nexhibiting proof on oath that a murder has been committed by the said\r\nfugitive within the said government, who shall thereon issue his warrant\r\nto the marshal or deputy marshal of the same place, to arrest the fugitive\r\nand have him before the said district judge, or the said pursuer may apply\r\nto such marshal or deputy marshal directly, who, on exhibition of proof\r\nas aforesaid, shall thereupon arrest the fugitive, and carry him before\r\nthe said district judge; and when before him in either way, he shall\r\nwithin not less than ---- days, nor more than ----, hold a special court\r\nof inquiry, causing a grand jury to be summoned thereto, and charging\r\nthem to inquire whether the fugitive hath committed a murder, not of\r\nthe nature of treason, within the province demanding him, and on their\r\nfinding a true bill, the judge shall order the officer in whose custody\r\nthe fugitive is, to deliver him over to the person authorized as aforesaid\r\nto receive him, and shall give such further authorities to aid the said\r\nperson in safe keeping and conveying the said fugitive to the limits of\r\nthe United States, as shall be necessary and within his powers; and his\r\npowers shall expressly extend to command the aid of _posse_ of every\r\ndistrict through which the said fugitive is to be carried. And the said\r\njustices, judges and other officers, shall use in the premises the same\r\nprocess and proceedings, _mutatis mutandis_, and govern themselves by the\r\nsame principles and rules of law, as in cases of murder committed on the\r\nhigh seas.\r\n\r\nAnd the manner of demand by the United States and of compliance by the\r\nSpanish government, shall be as follows. The person authorized by a\r\njustice of the Supreme Court of the United States, or by the district\r\njudge where the murder was committed, to pursue the fugitive, may apply\r\nto ----\r\n\r\nEvidence on oath, though written and _ex parte_, shall have the same\r\nweight with the judge and grand jury in the preceding cases, as if the\r\nsame had been given before them orally and in presence of the prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe courts of justice of the said States and provinces, shall be\r\nreciprocally open for the demand and recovery of debts due to any person\r\ninhabiting the one, from any person fled therefrom and found in the other,\r\nin like manner as they are open to their own citizens; likewise, for the\r\nrecovery of the property, or the value thereof, carried away from any\r\nperson inhabiting the one, by any person fled therefrom and found in the\r\nother, which carrying away shall give a right of civil action, whether\r\nthe fugitive came to the original possession lawfully or unlawfully,\r\neven feloniously; likewise, for the recovery of damages sustained by any\r\nforgery committed by such fugitive. And the same provision shall hold\r\nin favor of the representatives of the original creditor or sufferer,\r\nand against the representatives of the original debtor, carrier away or\r\nforger; also, in favor of either government or of corporations, as of\r\nnatural persons. But in no case, shall the person of the defendant be\r\nimprisoned for the debt, though the process, whether original, mesne,\r\nor final, be for the form sake directed against his person. If the time\r\nbetween the flight and the commencement of the action exceed not ----\r\nyears, it shall be counted but as one day under any act of limitations.\r\n\r\nThis convention shall continue in force ---- years from the exchange of\r\nratifications, and shall not extend to anything happening previous to such\r\nexchange.\r\n\r\n_Heads of consideration on the establishment of conventions between the\r\nUnited States and their neighbors, for the mutual delivery of fugitives\r\nfrom justice._\r\n\r\nHas a nation a right to punish a person who has not offended itself?\r\nWriters on the law of nature agree that it has not. That, on the contrary,\r\nexiles and fugitives are, to it, as other strangers, and have a right\r\nof residence, unless their presence would be noxious; e. g. infectious\r\npersons. One writer extends the exception to atrocious criminals, too\r\nimminently dangerous to society; namely, to pirates, murderers, and\r\nincendiaries. Vattel, L.1.5. 233.\r\n\r\nThe punishment of _piracy_ being provided for by our laws, need not be so\r\nby convention.\r\n\r\n_Murder._ Agreed that this is one of the extreme crimes justifying a\r\ndenial of habitation, arrest and re-delivery. It should be carefully\r\nrestrained by definition to homicide of _malice prepense, and not of the\r\nnature of treason_.\r\n\r\n_Incendiaries_, or those guilty of _arson_. This crime is so rare as not\r\nto call for extraordinary provision by a convention. The only _rightful_\r\nsubject then of arrest and delivery, for which we have _need_, is\r\n_murder_. Ought we to wish to strain the natural right of arresting and\r\nre-delivering fugitives to other cases?\r\n\r\nThe punishment of all real crimes is certainly desirable, as a security to\r\nsociety; the security is greater in proportion as the chances of avoiding\r\npunishment are less. But does the fugitive, from his country avoid\r\npunishment? He incurs exile, not voluntary, but under a moral necessity\r\nas strong as physical. Exile, in some countries, has been the highest\r\npunishment allowed by the laws. To most minds it is _next to death_;\r\nto many _beyond it_. The fugitive indeed is not of the latter; he must\r\nestimate it somewhat _less than death_. It may be said that to _some_, as\r\nforeigners, it is no punishment.\r\n\r\nAnswer. These cases are few. Laws are to be made for the mass of cases.\r\n\r\nThe object of a convention then, in other cases, would be, that the\r\nfugitive might not avoid the _difference between exile and the legal\r\npunishment of the case_. Now in what case would this _difference_ be so\r\nimportant, as to overweigh even the single inconvenience of multiplying\r\ncompacts?\r\n\r\n1. _Treason._ This, when real, merits the highest punishment. But most\r\ncodes extend their definitions of treason to acts not really against one's\r\ncountry. They do not distinguish between acts against the _government_ and\r\nacts against the _oppressions of the government_; the latter are virtues;\r\nyet they have furnished more victims to the executioner than the former;\r\nbecause real treasons are rare; oppressions frequent. The unsuccessful\r\nstrugglers against tyranny, have been the chief martyrs of treason laws\r\nin all countries.\r\n\r\nReformation of government with _our_ neighbors, being as much wanted\r\nnow as reformation of religion is, or ever was anywhere, we should not\r\nwish then, to give up to the executioner, the patriot who fails, and\r\nflees to us. Treasons then, taking the _simulated_ with the _real_, are\r\nsufficiently punished by exile.\r\n\r\n2. Crimes against _property_; the punishment in most countries, immensely\r\ndisproportionate to the crime.\r\n\r\nIn England and probably in Canada, to steal a horse is death, the first\r\noffence; to steal above the value of twelve pence is death, the second\r\noffence. All _excess_ of punishment is a crime. To remit a fugitive to\r\nexcessive punishment is to be accessary to the crime. Ought we to wish for\r\nthe obligation, or the right to do it? Better, on the whole, to consider\r\nthese crimes as sufficiently punished by the exile.\r\n\r\nThere is one crime, however, against property, pressed by its consequences\r\ninto more particular notice, to-wit:\r\n\r\n_Forgery_, whether of _coin_ or _paper_; and whether paper of _public_ or\r\n_private_ obligation. But the fugitive for forgery is punished by exile\r\nand confiscation of the property he leaves; to which add by convention,\r\na civil action against the property he carries or acquires, to the amount\r\nof the special damage done by his forgery.\r\n\r\nThe _carrying away_ of the property of another, may also be reasonably\r\nmade to found a _civil_ action. A convention then may include forgery and\r\nthe carrying away the property of others under the head of,\r\n\r\n3. _Flight from debts._\r\n\r\nTo remit the fugitive in this case, would be to remit him in every case.\r\nFor in the present state of things, it is next to impossible not to owe\r\nsomething. But I see neither injustice nor inconvenience in permitting the\r\nfugitive to be sued in our courts. The laws of some countries punishing\r\nthe unfortunate debtor by perpetual imprisonment, he is right to liberate\r\nhimself by flight, and it would be wrong to re-imprison him in the\r\ncountry to which he flies. Let all process, therefore, be confined to his\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n_Murder_, not amounting to treason, being the only case in which the\r\nfugitive is to be delivered:\r\n\r\nOn what _evidence_, and _by whom_, shall he be delivered?\r\n\r\nIn this country, let any justice of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, or other judge of the district where the fugitive is found, use\r\nthe same proceedings as for a murder committed on the high seas, until\r\nthe _finding_ of the \"_true bill_\" by the grand jury; but evidence on oath\r\nfrom the country demanding him, though in _writing_ and _ex parte_, should\r\nhave the same effect as if delivered _orally_ at the _examination_.\r\n\r\nA true bill being found by the grand jury, let the officer in whose\r\ncustody the fugitive is, deliver him to the person charged to demand and\r\nreceive him.\r\n\r\nIn the British provinces adjoining us the same proceedings will do.\r\n\r\nIn the Spanish provinces, a proceeding adapted to the course of their laws\r\nshould be agreed on.\r\n\r\nMarch 22, 1792.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, April 28, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--My last letter to you was of the 10th of March. The preceding\r\none of January the 23d, had conveyed to you your appointment as Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary to the court of France. The present will, I hope, find you\r\nthere. I now enclose you the correspondence between the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury and minister of France, on the subject of the moneys furnished\r\nto the distressed of their colonies. You will perceive that the minister\r\nchose to leave the adjustment of the terms to be settled at Paris, between\r\nyourself and the King's ministers. This you will therefore be pleased\r\nto do on this principle; that we wish to avoid any loss by the mode of\r\npayment, but would not choose to make a gain which should throw loss on\r\nthem. But the letters of the Secretary of the Treasury will sufficiently\r\nexplain the desire of the government, and be a sufficient guide to you.\r\n\r\nI now enclose you the act passed by Congress for facilitating the\r\nexecution of the consular convention with France. In a bill which has\r\npassed the House of Representatives for raising moneys for the support of\r\nthe Indian war, while the duties on every other species of wine are raised\r\nfrom one to three-fourths more than they were, the best wines of France\r\nwill pay little more than the worst of any other country, to wit, between\r\nsix and seven cents a bottle; and where this exceeds forty per cent. on\r\ntheir cost, they will pay but the forty per cent. I consider this latter\r\nprovision as likely to introduce in abundance the cheaper wines of France,\r\nand the more so, as the tax on ardent spirits is considerably raised.\r\nI hope that these manifestations of friendly dispositions towards that\r\ncountry, will induce them to repeal the very obnoxious laws respecting\r\nour commerce, which were passed by the preceding National Assembly. The\r\npresent session of Congress will pass over, without any other notice of\r\nthem than the friendly preferences before mentioned. But if these should\r\nnot produce a retaliation of good on their part, a retaliation of evil\r\nmust follow on ours. It will be impossible to defer longer than the\r\nnext session of Congress, some counter regulations for the protection\r\nof our navigation and commerce. I must entreat you therefore, to avail\r\nyourself of every occasion of friendly remonstrance on this subject.\r\nIf they wish an equal and cordial treaty with us, we are ready to enter\r\ninto it. We would wish that this could be the scene of negotiation, from\r\nconsiderations suggested by the nature of our government, which will\r\nreadily occur to you. Congress will rise on this day sen'night. I enclose\r\nyou a letter from Mrs. Greene, who asks your aid in getting her son\r\nforwarded by the Diligence to London, on his way to America. The letter\r\nwill explain to you the mode and the means, and the parentage and genius\r\nof the young gentleman will insure your aid to him. As this goes by the\r\nFrench packet, I send no newspapers, laws, or other articles of that kind,\r\nthe postage of which would be high.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                Philadelphia, May 16, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--The day after your departure, I received from a Mr. Green,\r\na merchant now at New York, through a third person, the following\r\ncommunication: \"that he had had very _late_ advices from Spain, _by\r\nway of the Spanish islands_, to this effect, that war with France was\r\ninevitable, that troops were marching from all quarters of the kingdom\r\nto the frontiers, and that fifty sail of the line had been commissioned.\"\r\nThis was permitted to be mentioned to me, but, for particular reasons, to\r\nno other persons. I suppose the particular reasons were some mercantile\r\nspeculation founded on the intelligence; perhaps it may be to buy up all\r\nour flour. We have London news from the 1st of April, and nothing of this\r\nis mentioned. I have a letter from Colonel Humphreys of March 18, which\r\nsays nothing of it. I am in hopes, therefore, the only effect will be\r\nto get us a good price for our flour or fish; this being our look out,\r\nwhile the success of the speculation is that of the adventurer. You will\r\nrecollect that we had learned the death of the Emperor of Morocco, after\r\na battle in which he was victorious. The brother opposed to him, it seems,\r\nwas killed in the same action, and the one--Muley Islema--who had been so\r\nlong in the sanctuary, is proclaimed Emperor. He was the best character of\r\nthe three, and is likely to be peaceable. This information is from Colonel\r\nHumphreys. The Queen of Portugal is still in the same state. Wyllys does\r\nnot pronounce her curable, though he says there is nothing which indicates\r\nthe contrary. He has removed from her all her former physicians. Mr.\r\nMadison has favored me with some corrections for my letter to Mr. H. It\r\nis now in the hands of the Attorney General, and shall then be submitted\r\nto Colonel Hamilton. I find that these examinations will retard the\r\ndelivery of it considerably. However, delay is preferable to error. Mr.\r\nPinckney is engaged in going over such papers of my office as may put him\r\nin possession of whatever has passed between us and the court he is going\r\nto. I have one hundred olive trees, and some caper plants, arrived here\r\nfrom Marseilles, which I am sending on to Charleston, where, Mr. Pinckney\r\ntells me, they have already that number living of those I had before sent\r\nthem. I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect respect\r\nand attachment, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. DE VIAR AND DE JAUDENES.\r\n\r\n                                                Philadelphia, May 17, 1792.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--We lately received from Mr. Leagrove, our Indian agent for\r\nthe Southern Department, a letter, of which the enclosed is an extract,\r\nwhereby it appeared that a party of the Creek Indians, under the influence\r\nof the adventurer Bowles, had meditated some depredations on the Spanish\r\nsettlements, from which they had been diverted by a friend of our\r\nagent, but that their disposition to do injury was, perhaps, not quite\r\nextinguished. Sensible how much it is in the power of neighbor nations\r\nto contribute to mutual happiness and prosperity, by faithfully using\r\ntheir good offices wherever they can procure the peace and advantage\r\nof each other, and feeling a union of interest with Spain in whatever\r\nregards the adjacent possessions, we have not hesitated to give general\r\ninstructions to our agent in that department to cultivate in the Indians\r\nthe same friendly dispositions towards the Spanish settlements as towards\r\nourselves, and to promote their peace and interest in every case with the\r\nsame zeal as our own.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to enclose you one of those orders, to congratulate you\r\non the intelligence that the leader, who gave occasion to this particular\r\ninterposition, is no longer in a situation to threaten further danger,\r\nand to assure you that, as far as shall depend on us, we will, on every\r\nfuture occasion, sincerely use what influence we may have with the Indians\r\nto discountenance and prevent every measure they may meditate against the\r\npeace or prosperity of your subjects.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Gentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                Philadelphia, May 18, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Since I wrote you the day before yesterday, I have received\r\na letter of March 25, from Colonel Humphreys, informing me that the\r\nQueen of Portugal was considerably better, as also mentioning the death\r\nof the Emperor of Germany. What effect this last event will have on the\r\naffairs of Europe, cannot be foreseen, the character of the successor\r\nbeing absolutely unknown. He is twenty-four years of age. One would\r\nconjecture that, if he has any dispositions to war, he would think a\r\nlittle time necessary to get his election passed in form, to see if the\r\ntroubles within his dominions quieted by his father, would be likely to\r\nbreak out or not, &c., and that this would hold him back one campaign.\r\nStill, this event renders peace less certain, as the character of his\r\nfather was so decidedly pacific, that one might count on that. There\r\nseems to have been a magnificent story current in London for the three or\r\nfour last days of March, of the capture of Seringapatam and Tippoo Saib,\r\ngreat slaughter, &c.; but, on the 1st of April, the date of the latest\r\npaper which the vessel brings (she is from Glasgow), it had died away to\r\na _hum_ raised by stock jobbers, who wanted to sell out. It did in fact\r\nraise East India stock two or three per cent. Still it was not fallen into\r\nentire discredit, as appears by some paragraphs, and consequently cannot\r\nbe decidedly pronounced untrue. Perhaps the contradiction of it was the\r\ncounter hum of those who wanted to buy in.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere respect and attachment,\r\ndear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                Philadelphia, May 23, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I have determined to make the subject of a letter what for some\r\ntime past has been a subject of inquietude to my mind, without having\r\nfound a good occasion of disburthening itself to you in conversation,\r\nduring the busy scenes which occupied you here. Perhaps, too, you may be\r\nable in your present situation, or on the road, to give it more time and\r\nreflection than you could do here at any moment.\r\n\r\nWhen you first mentioned to me your purpose of retiring from the\r\ngovernment, though I felt all the magnitude of the event, I was in\r\na considerable degree silent. I knew that, to such a mind as yours,\r\npersuasion was idle and impertinent; that before forming your decision you\r\nhad weighed all the reasons for and against the measure, had made up your\r\nmind on full view of them, and that there could be little hope of changing\r\nthe result. Pursuing my reflections, too, I knew we were some day to try\r\nto walk alone, and if the essay should be made while you should be alive\r\nand looking on, we should derive confidence from that circumstance, and\r\nresource, if it failed. The public mind, too, was calm and confident, and\r\ntherefore in a favorable state for making the experiment. Had no change of\r\ncircumstances intervened, I should not, with any hopes of success, have\r\nnow ventured to propose to you a change of purpose. But the public mind\r\nis no longer confident and serene; and that from causes in which you are\r\nno ways personally mixed. Though these causes have been hackneyed in the\r\npublic papers in detail, it may not be amiss, in order to calculate the\r\neffect they are capable of producing, to take a view of them in the mass,\r\ngiving to each the form, real or imaginary, under which they have been\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nIt has been urged, then, that a public debt, greater than we can possibly\r\npay, before other causes of adding new debt to it will occur, has been\r\nartificially created by adding together the whole amount of the debtor and\r\ncreditor sides of accounts, instead of only taking their balances, which\r\ncould have been paid off in a short time: that this accumulation of debt\r\nhas taken forever out of our power those easy sources of revenue which,\r\napplied to the ordinary necessities and exigencies of government, would\r\nhave answered them habitually, and covered us from habitual murmurings\r\nagainst taxes and tax-gatherers, reserving extraordinary calls for those\r\nextraordinary occasions which would animate the people to meet them:\r\nthat though the calls for money have been no greater than we must expect\r\ngenerally, for the same or equivalent exigencies, yet we are already\r\nobliged to strain the impost till it produces clamor, and will produce\r\nevasion and war on our own citizens to collect it, and even to resort\r\nto an _excise_ law of odious character with the people, partial in its\r\noperation, unproductive unless enforced by arbitrary and vexatious means,\r\nand committing the authority of the government in parts where resistance\r\nis most probable and coercion least practicable. They cite propositions\r\nin Congress, and suspect other projects on foot still to increase the\r\nmass of debt. They say, that by borrowing at two-thirds of the interest,\r\nwe might have paid off the principal in two-thirds of the time; but that\r\nfrom this we are precluded by its being made irredeemable but in small\r\nportions and long terms; that this irredeemable quality was given it for\r\nthe avowed purpose of inviting its transfer to foreign countries. They\r\npredict that this transfer of the principal, when completed, will occasion\r\nan exportation of three millions of dollars annually for the interest,\r\na drain of coin, of which, as there has been no examples, no calculation\r\ncan be made of its consequences: that the banishment of our coin will be\r\ncomplicated by the creation of ten millions of paper money, in the form of\r\nbank bills now issuing into circulation. They think the ten or twelve per\r\ncent. annual profit paid to the lenders of this paper medium taken out of\r\nthe pockets of the people, who would have had without interest the coin\r\nit is banishing: that all the capital employed in paper speculation is\r\nbarren and useless, producing, like that on a gaming table, no accession\r\nto itself, and is withdrawn from commerce and agriculture, where it\r\nwould have produced addition to the common mass: that it nourishes in our\r\ncitizens habits of vice and idleness, instead of industry and morality:\r\nthat it has furnished effectual means of corrupting such a portion of the\r\nlegislature as turns the balance between the honest voters, whichever\r\nway it is directed: that this corrupt squadron, deciding the voice of\r\nthe legislature, have manifested their dispositions to get rid of the\r\nlimitations imposed by the Constitution on the general legislature,\r\nlimitations, on the faith of which, the States acceded to that instrument:\r\nthat the ultimate object of all this is to prepare the way for a change\r\nfrom the present republican form of government to that of a monarchy,\r\nof which the English constitution is to be the model: that this was\r\ncontemplated by the convention is no secret, because its partisans have\r\nmade more of it. To effect it then was impracticable, but they are still\r\neager after their object, and are predisposing everything for its ultimate\r\nattainment. So many of them have got into the Legislature, that, aided\r\nby the corrupt squadron of paper dealers, who are at their devotion, they\r\nmake a majority in both houses. The republican party, who wish to preserve\r\nthe government in its present form, are fewer in number; they are fewer\r\neven when joined by the two, three, or half dozen anti-federalists, who,\r\nthough they dare not avow it, are still opposed to any general government;\r\nbut, being less so to a republican than a monarchical one, they naturally\r\njoin those whom they think pursuing the lesser evil.\r\n\r\nOf all the mischiefs objected to the system of measures before mentioned,\r\nnone is so afflicting and fatal to every honest hope, as the corruption\r\nof the Legislature. As it was the earliest of these measures, it became\r\nthe instrument for producing the risk, and will be the instrument for\r\nproducing in future a king, lords and commons, or whatever else those\r\nwho direct it may choose. Withdrawn such a distance from the eye of\r\ntheir constituents, and these so dispersed as to be inaccessible to\r\npublic information, and particularly to that of the conduct of their own\r\nrepresentatives, they will form the most corrupt government on earth,\r\nif the means of their corruption be not prevented. The only hope of\r\nsafety hangs now on the numerous representation which is to come forward\r\nthe ensuing year. Some of the new members will be, probably, either in\r\nprinciple or interest, with the present majority; but it is expected\r\nthat the great mass will form an accession to the republican party. They\r\nwill not be able to undo all which the two preceding Legislatures, and\r\nespecially the first, have done. Public faith and right will oppose this.\r\nBut some parts of the system may be rightfully reformed, a liberation from\r\nthe rest unremittingly pursued as fast as right will permit, and the door\r\nshut in future against similar commitments of the nation. Should the next\r\nLegislature take this course, it will draw upon them the whole monarchical\r\nand paper interest; but the latter, I think, will not go all lengths with\r\nthe former, because creditors will never, of their own accord, fly off\r\nentirely from their debtors; therefore, this is the alternative least\r\nlikely to produce convulsion. But should the majority of the new members\r\nbe still in the same principles with the present, and show that we have\r\nnothing to expect but a continuance of the same practices, it is not easy\r\nto conjecture what would be the result, nor what means would be resorted\r\nto for correction of the evil. True wisdom would direct that they should\r\nbe temperate and peaceable; but the division of sentiment and interest\r\nhappens unfortunately to be so geographical, that no mortal can say that\r\nwhat is most wise and temperate would prevail against what is most easy\r\nand obvious? I can scarcely contemplate a more incalculable evil than the\r\nbreaking of the Union into two or more parts. Yet when we consider the\r\nmass which opposed the original coalescence; when we consider that it\r\nlay chiefly in the Southern quarter; that the Legislature have availed\r\nthemselves of no occasion of allaying it, but on the contrary, whenever\r\nNorthern and Southern prejudices have come into conflict, the latter\r\nhave been sacrificed and the former soothed; that the owers of the debt\r\nare in the Southern, and the holders of it in the Northern division;\r\nthat the anti-federal champions are now strengthened in argument by the\r\nfulfillment of their predictions; that this has been brought about by\r\nthe monarchical federalists themselves, who, having been for the new\r\ngovernment merely as a stepping stone to monarchy, have themselves adopted\r\nthe very constructions of the Constitution, of which, when advocating\r\nits acceptance before the tribunal of the people, they declared it\r\nunsusceptible; that the republican federalists who espoused the same\r\ngovernment for its intrinsic merits, are disarmed of their weapons; that\r\nwhich they denied as prophecy, having now become true history, who can\r\nbe sure that these things may not proselyte the small number which was\r\nwanting to place the majority on the other side? And this is the event at\r\nwhich I tremble, and to prevent which I consider your continuing at the\r\nhead of affairs as of the last importance. The confidence of the whole\r\nUnion is centred in you. Your being at the helm will be more than an\r\nanswer to every argument which can be used to alarm and lead the people\r\nin any quarter, into violence and secession. North and South will hang\r\ntogether if they have you to hang on; and if the first correction of a\r\nnumerous representation should fail in its effect, your presence will give\r\ntime for trying others, not inconsistent with the union and peace of the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nI am perfectly aware of the oppression under which your present office\r\nlays your mind, and of the ardor with which you pant for domestic life.\r\nBut there is sometimes an eminence of character on which society have such\r\npeculiar claims as to control the predelictions of the individual for\r\na particular walk of happiness, and restrain him to that alone arising\r\nfrom the present and future benedictions of mankind. This seems to be\r\nyour condition, and the law imposed on you by providence in forming your\r\ncharacter, and fashioning the events on which it was to operate; and it\r\nis to motives like these, and not to personal anxieties of mine or others\r\nwho have no right to call on you for sacrifices, that I appeal, and urge\r\na revisal of it, on the ground of change in the aspect of things. Should\r\nan honest majority result from the new and enlarged representation; should\r\nthose acquiesce whose principles or interest they may control, your wishes\r\nfor retirement would be gratified with less danger, as soon as that shall\r\nbe manifest, without awaiting the completion of the second period of four\r\nyears. One or two sessions will determine the crisis; and I cannot but\r\nhope that you can resolve to add more to the many years you have already\r\nsacrificed to the good of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe fear of suspicion that any selfish motive of continuance in office\r\nmay enter into this solicitation on my part, obliges me to declare that\r\nno such motive exists. It is a thing of mere indifference to the public\r\nwhether I retain or relinquish my purpose of closing my tour with the\r\nfirst periodical renovation of the government. I know my own measure\r\ntoo well to suppose that my services contribute anything to the public\r\nconfidence, or the public utility. Multitudes can fill the office in\r\nwhich you have been pleased to place me, as much to their advantage\r\nand satisfaction. I have, therefore, no motive to consult but my own\r\ninclination, which is bent irresistibly on the tranquil enjoyment of my\r\nfamily, my farm and my books. I should repose among them, it is true, in\r\nfar greater security, if I were to know that you remained at the watch;\r\nand I hope it will be so. To the inducements urged from a view of our\r\ndomestic affairs, I will add a bare mention, of what indeed need only to\r\nbe mentioned, that weighty motives for your continuance are to be found\r\nin our foreign affairs. I think it probable that both the Spanish and\r\nEnglish negotiations, if not completed before your purpose is known, will\r\nbe suspended from the moment it is known, and that the latter nation will\r\nthen use double diligence in fomenting the Indian War. With my wishes for\r\nthe future, I shall at the same time express my gratitude for the past,\r\nat least my portion in it; and beg permission to follow you, whether in\r\npublic or private life, with those sentiments of sincere attachment and\r\nrespect, with which I am unalterably, dear Sir, your affectionate friend\r\nand humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. JEFFERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES, TO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\n                                                Philadelphia, May 29, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--Your favor of March 5th has been longer unanswered than consisted\r\nwith my wishes, to forward as much as possible explanations of the\r\nseveral matters it contained. But these matters were very various, and\r\nthe evidence of them not easily to be obtained, even were it could be\r\nobtained at all. It has been a work of time and trouble, to collect from\r\nthe different States all the acts themselves, of which you had cited the\r\ntitles, and to investigate the judiciary decisions which were classed with\r\nthose acts as infractions of the treaty of peace. To these causes of delay\r\nmay be added the daily duties of my office, necessarily multiplied during\r\nthe sessions of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nSection 1. I can assure you with truth, that we meet you on this\r\noccasion, with the sincerest dispositions to remove from between the\r\ntwo countries those obstacles to a cordial friendship, which have arisen\r\nfrom an inexecution of some articles of the treaty of peace. The desire\r\nentertained by this country, to be on the best terms with yours, has\r\nbeen constant, and has manifested itself through its different forms of\r\nadministration, by repeated overtures to enter into such explanations and\r\narrangements as should be right and necessary to bring about a complete\r\nexecution of the treaty. The same dispositions lead us to wish, that the\r\noccasion now presented should not be defeated by useless recapitulations\r\nof what had taken place anterior to that instrument. It was with concern,\r\ntherefore, I observed that you had thought it necessary to go back to\r\nthe very commencement of the war, and in several parts of your letter\r\nto enumerate and comment on all the acts of our different legislatures,\r\npassed during the whole course of it, in order to deduce from thence,\r\nimputations which your justice would have suppressed, had the whole truth\r\nbeen presented to your view, instead of particular traits, detached from\r\nthe ground on which they stood. However easy it would be to justify our\r\ncountry, by bringing into view the whole ground, on both sides, to show\r\nthat legislative warfare began with the British Parliament; that when they\r\nlevelled at persons or property, it was against entire towns or countries,\r\nwithout discrimination of cause or conduct, while we touched individuals\r\nonly; naming them man by man, after due consideration of each case, and\r\ncareful attention not to confound the innocent with the guilty; however\r\nadvantageously we might compare the distant and tranquil situation of\r\ntheir Legislature with the scenes in the midst of which ours were obliged\r\nto legislate; and might then ask, whether the difference of circumstance\r\nand situation would not have justified a contrary difference of conduct,\r\nand whether the wonder ought to be, that our legislatures had done so\r\nmuch, or so little? we will waive all this, because it would lead to\r\nrecollections, as unprofitable as unconciliating. The titles of some of\r\nyour acts, and a single clause of one of them only, shall be thrown among\r\nthe documents at the end of this letter, No. 1, 2, and with this we will\r\ndrop forever the curtain on this tragedy!\r\n\r\nSec. 2. We now come together to consider that instrument which was to heal\r\nour wounds, and begin a new chapter in our history. The state in which\r\nthat found things, is to be considered as rightful: so says the law of\r\nnations. [6]\"L'état où les choses se trouvent au moment du traité doit\r\npasser pour legitime; et si l'on veut y apporter du changement il faut que\r\nle traité en fasse une mention expresse. Par consequent toutes les choses\r\ndont le traité ne dit rien, doivent demeurer dans l'etat où elles se\r\ntrouvent lors de sa conclusion.\" Vattel, 1. 4, s. 21. [7]\"De quibus nihil\r\ndictum, ea manent quo sunt loco.\" Wolf, 1222. No alterations then are to\r\nbe claimed on either side, but those which the treaty has provided. The\r\nmoment, too, to which it refers, as a rule of conduct for this country at\r\nlarge, was the moment of its notification to the country at large. Vattel,\r\n1. 4, s. 24. [8]\"Le traité de paix oblige les _parties contractantes_ du\r\nmoment qu'il est conclu aussitôt qu'il a reçu toute sa forme; et elles\r\ndoivent procurer incessamment l'execution; mais ce traité n'oblige les\r\n_sujets_ que du moment qu'il leur est notifié.\" And s. 25. \"Le traité\r\ndevient _par la publication_, une loi pour les sujets, et ils sont obligés\r\nde se conformer désormais aux dispositions dont on y est convenu.\" And\r\nanother author as pointedly says, [9]\"Pactio pacis _paciscentes_ statim\r\nobligat quam primum _perfecta_, cum ex pacto veniat obligatio. Subditos\r\nvero et milites, quam primum iisdem fuerit _publicata_; cum de eâ _ante\r\npublicationem ipsis certo constare non possit_.\" Wolf, s. 1229. It was\r\nstipulated, indeed, by the ninth article, that \"if, before its arrival in\r\nAmerica,\" any place or territory, belonging to either party, should be\r\nconquered by the arms of the other, it should be restored. This was the\r\nonly case in which transactions, intervening between the signature and\r\npublication, were to be nullified.\r\n\r\nCongress, on the 24th of March, 1783, received informal intelligence\r\nfrom the Marquis de la Fayette, that provisional articles were concluded;\r\nand, on the same day, they received a copy of the articles, in a letter\r\nof March 19th, from General Carleton and Admiral Digby. They immediately\r\ngave orders for recalling all armed vessels, and communicated the orders\r\nto those officers, who answered, on the 26th and 27th, that they were not\r\nauthorized to concur in the recall of armed vessels, on their part. On the\r\n11th of April, Congress received an official copy of these articles from\r\nDr. Franklin, with notice that a preliminary treaty was now signed between\r\nFrance, Spain and England. The event having now taken place on which the\r\nprovisional articles were to come into effect, on the usual footing of\r\npreliminaries, Congress immediately proclaim them, and, on the 19th of\r\nApril, a cessation of hostilities is published by the commander-in-chief.\r\nThese particulars place all acts preceding the 11th of April out of\r\nthe present discussion, and confine it to the treaty itself, and the\r\ncircumstances attending its execution. I have therefore taken the liberty\r\nof extracting from your list of American acts all of those preceding\r\nthat epoch, and of throwing them together in the paper No. 6, as things\r\nout of question. The subsequent acts shall be distributed, according to\r\ntheir several subjects, of I. Exile and confiscation: II. Debts: and III.\r\nInterest on those debts:\r\n\r\nBeginning, I. with those of exile and confiscation, which will be\r\nconsidered together, because blended together in most of the acts, and\r\nblended also in the same article of the treaty.\r\n\r\nSec. 3. It cannot be denied that the state of war strictly permits\r\na nation to seize the property of its enemies found within its own\r\nlimits, or taken in war, and in whatever form it exists, whether in\r\naction or possession. This is so perspicuously laid down by one of the\r\nmost respectable writers on subjects of this kind, that I shall use his\r\nwords, [10]\"Cum ea sit belli conditio, ut hostes sint omni jure spoliati,\r\nrationis est, quascunque res hostium apud hostes inventas dominum mutare,\r\net fisco cedere. Solet præterea in singulis fere belli indictionibus\r\nconstitui, ut bona hostium, tam _apud nos reperta_, quam capta bello\r\npublicentur. Si merum jus belli sequamur, etiam _immobilia_ possent vendi,\r\net eorum pretium in fiscum redigi, ut in mobilibus obtinet. Sed in omni\r\nfere Europa sola fit annotatio, ut eorum fructus, durante bello, percipiat\r\nfiscus, finito autem bello, ipsa immobilia ex pactis restituuntur\r\npristinis dominis.\" Bynkersh. Quest. Jur. Pub. 1. 1, c. 7. Every nation,\r\nindeed, would wish to pursue the latter practice, if under circumstances\r\nleaving them their usual resources. But the circumstances of our war were\r\nwithout example; excluded from all commerce, even with neutral nations,\r\nwithout arms, money, or the means of getting them abroad, we were obliged\r\nto avail ourselves of such resources as we found at home. Great Britain,\r\ntoo, did not consider it as an ordinary war, but a rebellion; she did\r\nnot conduct it according to the rules of war, established by the law of\r\nnations, but according to her acts of parliament, made from time to time,\r\nto suit circumstances. She would not admit our title even to the _strict\r\nrights_ of ordinary war; she cannot then claim from us its _liberalities_;\r\nyet the confiscations of property were by no means universal, and that of\r\ndebts still less so. What effect was to be produced on them by the treaty,\r\nwill be seen by the words of the fifth article, which are as follows:\r\n\r\nSec. 4. \"Art. V. It is agreed, that the Congress shall earnestly\r\nrecommend it to the Legislatures of the respective States, to provide\r\nfor the restitution of all estates, rights, and properties, which have\r\nbeen confiscated, belonging to real British subjects, and also of the\r\nestates, rights, and properties, of persons resident in districts in the\r\npossession of his Majesty's arms, and who have not borne arms against the\r\nsaid United States; and that persons of any other description shall have\r\nfree liberty to go to any part or parts of the thirteen United States, and\r\ntherein to remain twelve months, unmolested in their endeavors to obtain\r\nthe restitution of such of their estates, rights, and properties, as may\r\nhave been confiscated; and that Congress shall also earnestly recommend\r\nto the several States a reconsideration and revision of all acts or laws\r\nregarding the premises, so as to render the said laws or acts perfectly\r\nconsistent, not only with justice and equity, but with that spirit of\r\nconciliation, which, on the return of the blessings of peace, should\r\nuniversally prevail; and that Congress shall also earnestly recommend\r\nto the several States, that the estates, rights, and properties, of such\r\nlast-mentioned persons, shall be restored to them, they refunding to any\r\npersons, who may be now in possession, the bona fide price (where any\r\nhas been given), which such persons may have paid on purchasing any of\r\nthe said lands, rights, or properties, since the confiscation. And it\r\nis agreed, that all persons who have any interest in confiscated lands,\r\neither by debts, marriage, settlements, or otherwise, shall meet with no\r\nlawful impediment in the prosecution of their just rights.\"\r\n\r\n\"Art. VI. That there shall be no future confiscations made.\"\r\n\r\nSec. 5. Observe, that in every other article, the parties agree expressly,\r\nthat such and such things _shall be done_; in this, they only agree to\r\n_recommend_ that they shall be done. You are pleased to say (page 7), \"It\r\ncannot be presumed, that the Commissioners, who negotiated the treaty of\r\npeace, would engage, in behalf of Congress, to make _recommendations_ to\r\nthe Legislatures of the respective States, which they did not expect to\r\nbe effectual, or enter into direct stipulations which they had not the\r\npower to enforce.\" On the contrary, we may fairly presume that, if they\r\nhad had the power to _enforce_, they would not merely have _recommended_.\r\nWhen, in every other article, they agree expressly _to do_, why in\r\nthis do they change the style suddenly, and agree only to _recommend_?\r\nBecause the things here proposed to be done were retrospective in their\r\nnature--would tear up the laws of the several States, and the contracts\r\nand transactions, private and public, which had taken place under them;\r\nand retrospective laws were forbidden by the constitutions of several of\r\nthe States. Between persons whose native language is that of his treaty,\r\nit is unnecessary to explain the difference between _enacting_ a thing to\r\nbe done, and _recommending_ it to be done; the words themselves being as\r\nwell understood as any by which they could be explained. But it may not\r\nbe unnecessary to observe, that _recommendations_ to the people, instead\r\nof _laws_, had been introduced among us, and were rendered familiar in\r\nthe interval between discontinuing the old, and establishing the new\r\ngovernments. The conventions and committees who then assembled, to guide\r\nthe conduct of the People, having no authority to oblige them by law,\r\ntook up the practice of simply recommending measures to them. These\r\nrecommendations they either complied with or not, at their pleasure. If\r\nthey refused, there was complaint, but no compulsion. So, after organizing\r\nthe Governments, if at any time it became expedient that a thing should\r\nbe done, which Congress, or any other of the organized bodies, were not\r\nauthorized to ordain, they simply recommended, and left to the People,\r\nor their Legislatures, to comply, or not, as they pleased. It was\r\nimpossible that the negotiators on either side should have been ignorant\r\nof the difference between agreeing _to do_ a thing, and agreeing only to\r\n_recommend_ it to be done. The import of the terms is so different, that\r\nno deception or surprise could be supposed, even if there were no evidence\r\nthat the difference was attended to, explained, and understood.\r\n\r\nSec. 6. But the evidence on this occasion removes all question. It is\r\nwell known that the British court had it extremely at heart, to procure\r\na restitution of the estates of the refugees who had gone over to their\r\nside; that they proposed it in the first inferences, and insisted on it to\r\nthe last; that our commissioners, on the other hand, refused it from first\r\nto last, urging, 1st. That it was unreasonable to restore the confiscated\r\nproperty of the refugees, unless they would reimburse the destruction of\r\nthe property of our citizens, committed on their part; and 2dly. That it\r\nwas beyond the powers of the commissions to stipulate, or of Congress to\r\nenforce. On this point, the treaty hung long. It was the subject of a\r\nspecial mission of a confidential agent of the British negotiator from\r\nParis to London. It was still insisted on, on his return, and still\r\nprotested against, by our commissioners; and when they were urged to\r\nagree only, that Congress should _recommend_ to the State Legislatures\r\nto restore the estates, &c., of the refugees, they were expressly told\r\nthat the Legislatures would not regard the recommendation. In proof of\r\nthis, I subjoin extracts from the letters and journals of Mr. Adams and\r\nDr. Franklin, two of our commissioners, the originals of which are among\r\nthe records of the Department of State, and shall be open to you for a\r\nverification of the copies. These prove, beyond all question, that the\r\ndifference between an express agreement to do a thing, and to recommend\r\nit to be done, was well understood by both parties, and that the British\r\nnegotiators were put on their guard by those on our part, not only that\r\nthe Legislature will be free to refuse, but that they probably would\r\nrefuse. And it is evident from all circumstances, that Mr. Oswald accepted\r\nthe _recommendation_ merely to have something to oppose to the clamors\r\nof the refugees--to keep alive a hope in them, that they might yet get\r\ntheir property from the State Legislatures; and that, if they should fail\r\nin this, they would have ground to demand indemnification from their own\r\nGovernment; and he might think it a circumstance of present relief at\r\nleast, that the question of indemnification by them should be kept out of\r\nsight, till time and events should open it upon the nation insensibly.\r\n\r\nSec. 7. The same was perfectly understood by the British ministry, and by\r\nthe members of both Houses in Parliament, as well those who advocated, as\r\nthose who oppose the treaty; the latter of whom, being out of the secrets\r\nof the negotiation, must have formed their judgments on the mere import\r\nof the terms. That all parties concurred in this exposition, will appear\r\nby the following extracts from the parliamentary register; a work, which,\r\nwithout pretending to give what is spoken with verbal accuracy, may yet\r\nbe relied on, we presume, for the general reasoning and opinions of the\r\nspeakers.\r\n\r\nHouse of Commons.--_The preliminary articles under consideration; 1783,\r\nFebruary 17th._\r\n\r\n_Mr. Thomas Pitt._--\"That the interests of the sincere loyalists were\r\nas dear to him, as to any man; but that he could never think it would\r\nhave been promoted by carrying on that unfortunate war, which Parliament\r\nhad in fact suspended before the beginning of the treaty; that it was\r\nimpossible, after the part Congress was pleased to take in it, to conceive\r\nthat their _recommendation_ would not have its proper influence on the\r\ndifferent Legislatures; that he did not himself see what more could have\r\nbeen done on their behalf, except by renewing the war for their sakes,\r\nand increasing our and their calamities.\"--_9 Debrett's Parliamentary\r\nRegister_, 233.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Wilberforce._--\"When he considered the case of the loyalists, he\r\nconfessed he felt himself there conquered; there he saw his country\r\nhumiliated; he saw her at the feet of America! Still he was induced to\r\nbelieve, that Congress would religiously comply with the article, and that\r\nthe loyalists would obtain redress from America. Should they not, this\r\ncountry was bound to afford it them. They must be compensated. Ministers,\r\nhe was persuaded, meant to keep the faith of the nation with them, and\r\nhe verily believed, had obtained the best terms they possibly could for\r\nthem.\"--_Ib._ 236.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Secretary Townsend._--\"He was ready to admit, that many of the\r\nloyalists had the strongest claims upon this country; and he trusted,\r\nshould the _recommendation_ of Congress to the American States prove\r\nunsuccessful, which he flattered himself would not be the case, this\r\ncountry would feel itself bound in honor to make them full compensation\r\nfor their losses.\"--_Ib._ 262.\r\n\r\nHouse of Lords.--_February 17, 1783._\r\n\r\n_Lord Shelburne._--\"A part must be wounded, that the whole of the empire\r\nmay not perish. If better terms could be had, think you, my lords,\r\nthat I would not have embraced them? You all know my creed. You all\r\nknow my steadiness. If it were possible to put aside the bitter cup the\r\nadversities of this country presented to me, you know I would have done\r\nit; but you called for peace. I had 'but the alternative, either to accept\r\nthe terms (said Congress) of our recommendation to the States in favor of\r\nthe colonists, or continue the war. It is in our power to do _no more than\r\nrecommend_.' Is there any man who hears me, who will clap his hand on his\r\nheart, and step forward and say, I ought to have broken off the treaty?\r\nIf there be, I am sure he neither knows the state of the country, nor\r\nyet has he paid any attention to the wishes of it. But say the worst, and\r\nthat, after all, this estimable set of men are not received and cherished\r\nin the bosom of their own country--is England so lost to gratitude, and\r\nall the feelings of humanity, as not to afford them an asylum? Who can\r\nbe so base as to think she will refuse it to them? Surely it cannot be\r\nthat noble-minded man, who would plunge his country again knee deep in\r\nblood, and saddle it with an expense of twenty millions, for the purpose\r\nof restoring them. Without one drop of blood spilt, and without one-fifth\r\nof the expense of one year's campaign, happiness and ease can be given\r\nthe loyalists in as ample a manner as these blessings were ever in their\r\nenjoyment; therefore, let the outcry cease on this head.\"--_Ib._ 70, 71.\r\n\r\n_Lord Hawke._--\"In America,\" said he, \"Congress had engaged to recommend\r\ntheir [the loyalists'] cause to the Legislatures of the country. What\r\nother term could they adopt? He had searched the journals of Congress on\r\nthis subject; what other term did they, or do they ever adopt in their\r\nrequisitions to the different provinces? It is an undertaking on the\r\npart of Congress; that body, like the King here, is the executive power\r\nin America. Can the crown undertake for the two Houses of Parliament?\r\nIt can only recommend. He flattered himself that recommendation would be\r\nattended with success; but, said he, state the case, that it will not, the\r\nliberality of Great Britain is still open to them. Ministers had pledged\r\nthemselves to indemnify them; not only in the address now moved for, but\r\neven in the last address, and in the speech from the throne.\"\r\n\r\n_Lord Walsingham._--\"We had only the _recommendation_ of Congress to\r\ntrust to, and how often had their recommendations been fruitless? There\r\nwere many cases in point in which provincial assemblies had peremptorily\r\nrefused the recommendations of Congress. It was but the other day the\r\nStates refused money on the recommendations of Congress. Rhode Island\r\nunanimously refused, when the Congress desired to be authorized to\r\nlay a duty of five per cent. because the funds had failed. Many other\r\ncircumstances might be produced of the failure of the recommendations of\r\nCongress, and therefore we ought not, in negotiating for the loyalists, to\r\nhave trusted to the recommendations of Congress. Nothing but the _repeal_\r\nof the acts existing against them ought to have sufficed, as nothing else\r\ncould give effect to the treaty; _repeal_ was not mentioned. They had only\r\nstipulated to revise and reconsider them.\"--_11 Debrett's Parliamentary\r\nReg. 44._\r\n\r\n_Lord Sackville._--\"The King's ministers had weakly imagined that\r\nthe _recommendation_ of Congress was a sufficient security for these\r\nunhappy men. For his own part, so far from believing that this would be\r\nsufficient, or anything like sufficient, for their protection, he was of a\r\ndirect contrary opinion; and if they entertained any notions of this sort,\r\nhe would put an end to their idle hopes at once, by reading from a paper\r\nin his pocket, a resolution, which the assembly of Virginia had come to,\r\nso late as on the 17th of December last. The resolution was as follows:\r\n'That all demands or requests of the British court for the restitution\r\nof property, confiscated by this State, being neither supported by law,\r\nequity, or policy, are wholly inadmissible; and that our delegates in\r\nCongress be instructed to move Congress, that they may direct their\r\ndeputies, who shall represent these States in the general Congress, for\r\nadjusting a peace or truce, neither to agree to any such restitution,\r\nor submit that the laws made by any independent State in this Union, be\r\nsubjected to the adjudication of any power or powers on earth.'\"--_Ib._\r\n_pages_ 62, 63.\r\n\r\nSome of the speakers seem to have had not very accurate ideas of our\r\ngovernment. All of them, however, have perfectly understood, that a\r\n_recommendation_ was a matter, not of obligation or coercion, but of\r\npersuasion and influence, merely. They appear to have entertained greater\r\nor less degrees of hope or doubt, as to its effect on the Legislatures,\r\nand though willing to see the result of this chance, yet, if it failed,\r\nthey were prepared to take the work of indemnification on themselves.\r\n\r\nSec. 8. The agreement then being only that Congress should _recommend_ to\r\nthe State Legislatures a restitution of estates, and liberty to remain\r\na twelvemonth for the purpose of soliciting the restitution, and to\r\nrecommend a revision of all acts regarding the premises, Congress did,\r\nimmediately on the receipt of the definitive articles, to wit, on the\r\n14th of January, 1784, come to the following resolution, viz: \"Resolved\r\nunanimously, nine States being present, that it be, and it is hereby,\r\nearnestly recommended to the Legislatures of the respective States, to\r\nprovide for the restitution of all estates, rights, and properties, which\r\nhave been confiscated, belonging to real British subjects; and also, of\r\nthe estates, rights, and properties, of persons resident in districts\r\nwhich were in the possession of his Britannic Majesty's arms, at any time\r\nbetween the 30th day of November, 1782, and the 14th day of January,\r\n1784, and who have not borne arms against the said United States; and\r\nthat persons of any other description shall have free liberty to go to any\r\npart or parts of any of the thirteen United States, and therein to remain\r\ntwelve months, unmolested in their endeavors to obtain the restitution\r\nof such of their estates, rights, and properties, as may have been\r\nconfiscated; and it is also hereby earnestly recommended to the several\r\nStates, to reconsider and revise all their acts or laws regarding the\r\npremises, so as to render the said laws or acts perfectly consistent, not\r\nonly with justice and equity, but with that spirit of conciliation which,\r\non the return of the blessings of peace, should universally prevail; and\r\nit is hereby also earnestly recommended to the several States, that the\r\nestates, rights, and properties, of such last-mentioned persons should\r\nbe restored to them, they refunding to any persons who may be now in\r\npossession, the _bona fide_ price (where any has been given) which such\r\npersons may have paid, on purchasing any of the said lands, rights or\r\nproperties, since the confiscation.\r\n\r\n\"Ordered, That a copy of the proclamation of this date, together with the\r\nrecommendation, be transmitted to the several States by the Secretary.\"\r\n\r\nSec. 9. The British negotiators had been told by ours, that all the States\r\nwould refuse to comply with this recommendation; one only, however,\r\nrefused altogether. The others complied in a greater or less degree,\r\naccording to the circumstances and dispositions in which the events of\r\nthe war had left them; but, had all of them refused, it would have been\r\nno violation of the 5th article, but an exercise of that freedom of will,\r\nwhich was reserved to them, and so understood by all parties.\r\n\r\nThe following are the acts of your catalogue which belong to this head,\r\nwith such short observations as are necessary to explain them; beginning\r\nat that end of the Union, where, the war having raged most, we shall meet\r\nwith the most repugnance to favor:\r\n\r\nSec. 10. _Georgia._--1783, July 29. An act releasing certain persons from\r\ntheir bargains. A law had been passed during the war, to wit, in 1782,\r\n[A. 30.] confiscating the estates of persons therein named, and directing\r\nthem to be sold; they were sold; but some misunderstanding happened to\r\nprevail among the purchasers, as to the mode of payment. This act of\r\n1783, therefore, permits such persons to relinquish their bargains, and\r\nauthorizes a new sale; the lands remaining confiscated under the law made\r\nprevious to the peace.\r\n\r\n1785, Feb. 22. An act to authorize the auditor to liquidate the demands\r\nof such persons as have claims against the confiscated estates. In the\r\nsame law of confiscations made during the war, it had been provided\r\nthat the estates confiscated should be subject to pay the debts of their\r\nformer owner. This law of 1785, gave authority to the auditor to settle\r\nwith, and pay the creditors, and to sell the remaining part of the estate\r\nconfiscated as before.\r\n\r\n1787, Feb. 10. An act to compel the settlement of public accounts, for\r\ninflicting penalties, and vesting the auditor with certain powers. This\r\nlaw also is founded on the same confiscation law of 1782, requiring the\r\nauditor to press the settlement with the creditors, &c.\r\n\r\n1785, Feb. 7. An act for ascertaining the rights of aliens, and pointing\r\nout the mode for the admission of citizens. It first describes what\r\npersons shall be free to become citizens, and then declares none shall\r\nbe capable of that character who had been named in any confiscation law,\r\nor banished, or had borne arms against them. This act does not prohibit\r\neither the refugees, or real British subjects, from coming into the State\r\nto pursue their lawful affairs. It only excludes the former from the right\r\nof citizenship, and it is to be observed, that this recommendatory article\r\ndoes not say a word about giving them a right to become citizens. If the\r\nconduct of Georgia should appear to have been peculiarly uncomplying,\r\nit must be remembered that that State had peculiarly suffered; that the\r\nBritish army had entirely overrun it; had held possession of it for some\r\nyears; and that all the inhabitants had been obliged either to abandon\r\ntheir estates and fly their country, or to remain in it under a military\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nSec. 11. _South Carolina._--1783, August 15th. An act to vest 180 acres of\r\nland, late the property of James Holmes, in certain persons, in trust for\r\nthe benefit of a public school. These lands had been confiscated and sold\r\nduring the war. The present law prescribes certain proceedings as to the\r\npurchasers, and provides for paying the debts of the former proprietors.\r\n\r\n1786, March 22. An act to amend the confiscation act, and for other\r\npurposes therein mentioned. This relates only to estates which had been\r\nconfiscated before the peace. It makes some provision towards a final\r\nsettlement, and relieves a number of persons from the amercements which\r\nhad been imposed on them during the war, for the part they had taken.\r\n\r\n1784, March 26. An act restoring to certain persons their estates, and\r\npermitting the said persons to return, and for other purposes. This act\r\nrecites, that certain estates had been confiscated, and the owners, 124 in\r\nnumber, banished by former laws; that Congress had earnestly recommended\r\nin the terms of the treaty--it therefore distributes them into three lists\r\nor classes, restoring to all of them the lands themselves, where they\r\nremained unsold, and the price, where sold, requiring from those in lists\r\nNo. 1, and 3, to pay 12 per cent. on the value of what was restored, and\r\nNo. 2, nothing; and it permits all of them to return, only disqualifying\r\nthose of No. 1 and 3, who had borne military commissions against them,\r\nfrom holding any office for seven years.\r\n\r\nGovernor Moultrie's letter of June 21, 1786, informs us, that most of the\r\nconfiscations had been restored; that the value of those not restored,\r\nwas far less than that of the property of their citizens carried off by\r\nthe British, and that fifteen, instead of twelve months, had been allowed\r\nto the persons for whom permission was recommended to come and solicit\r\nrestitution.\r\n\r\nSec. 12. _North Carolina._--1784, October. An act directing the sale of\r\nconfiscated property.\r\n\r\n1785, Dec. 29. An act to secure and quiet in their possessions, the\r\npurchasers of lands, goods, &c., sold, or to be sold by the commissioners\r\nof forfeited estates. These two acts relate expressly to property\r\n\"heretofore confiscated,\" and secure purchasers under those former\r\nconfiscations.\r\n\r\n1790. The case of Bayard _v._ Singleton, adjudged in a court of\r\njudicature in North Carolina. Bayard was a purchaser of part of an estate\r\nconfiscated during the war, and the court adjudged his title valid; and\r\nit is difficult to conceive on what principle that adjudication can be\r\ncomplained of, as an infraction of the treaty.\r\n\r\n1785, Nov. 19. An act was passed to restore a confiscated estate to the\r\nformer proprietor, Edward Bridgen.\r\n\r\n1784, Oct. An act to describe and ascertain such persons as owed\r\nallegiance to the State, and impose certain disqualifications on certain\r\npersons therein named.\r\n\r\n1785, Nov. An act to amend the preceding act.\r\n\r\n1788, April. An act of pardon and oblivion. The two first of these acts\r\nexercised the right of the State to describe who should be its citizens,\r\nand who should be disqualified from holding offices. The last, entitled An\r\nact of pardon and oblivion, I have not been able to see; but, so far as\r\nit pardons, it is a compliance with the recommendation of Congress under\r\nthe treaty, and so far as it excepts persons out of the pardon, it is a\r\nrefusal to comply with the recommendation, which it had a right to do.\r\nIt does not appear that there has been any obstruction to the return of\r\nthose persons who had claims to prosecute.\r\n\r\nSec. 13. _Virginia._--The catalogue under examination, presents no\r\nact of this State subsequent to the treaty of peace, on the subject of\r\nconfiscations. By one of October 18, 1784, they declared there should\r\nbe no future confiscations. But they did not choose to comply with the\r\nrecommendation of Congress, as to the restoration of property which had\r\nbeen already confiscated; with respect to persons, the first assembly\r\nwhich met after the peace, passed--\r\n\r\n1783, October, The act prohibiting the migration of certain persons to\r\nthis commonwealth, and for other purposes therein mentioned, which was\r\nafterwards amended by,\r\n\r\n1786, October, An act to explain and amend the preceding. These acts,\r\nafter declaring who shall not have a right to migrate to, or become\r\ncitizens of, the State, have each an express proviso, that _nothing\r\ncontained in them shall be so construed as to contravene the treaty of\r\npeace with Great Britain_; and a great number of the refugees having\r\ncome into the State, under the protection of the first law, and it being\r\nunderstood that a party was forming in the State to ill-treat them, the\r\nGovernor, July 26, 1784, published the proclamation, No. 14, enjoining\r\nall magistrates and other civil officers, to protect them, and secure to\r\nthem the rights derived from the treaty, and acts of assembly aforesaid,\r\nand to bring to punishment all who should offend herein, in consequence\r\nof which, those persons remained quietly in the State; and many of them\r\nhave remained to this day.\r\n\r\nSec. 14. _Maryland._--1785, Nov. An act to vest certain powers in the\r\nGovernor and council. Sec. 3;\r\n\r\n1788. Nov. An act to empower the Governor and council to compound with the\r\ndiscoveries of British property and for other purposes. These acts relate\r\npurely to property which had been confiscated during the war; and the\r\nState not choosing to restore it, as recommended by Congress, passed them\r\nfor bringing to a conclusion the settlement of all transactions relative\r\nto the confiscated property.\r\n\r\nI do not find any law of this State, which could prohibit the free return\r\nof their refugees, or the reception of the subjects of Great Britain, or\r\nof any other country. And I find that they passed, in\r\n\r\n1786, Nov. An act to repeal that part of the act for the security of their\r\ngovernment, which disqualified non-jurors from holding offices, and voting\r\nat elections.\r\n\r\n1790. The ease of Harrison's representatives in the court of chancery\r\nof Maryland, is in the list of infractions. These representatives being\r\nBritish subjects, and the laws of this country, like those of England,\r\nnot permitting aliens to hold lands, the question was, whether British\r\nsubjects were aliens. They decided that they were; consequently, that they\r\ncould not take lands; and consequently, also, that the lands in this case\r\nescheated to the State. Whereupon, the Legislature immediately interposed,\r\nand passed a special act, allowing the benefits of the succession to the\r\nrepresentatives. But had they not relieved them, the case would not have\r\ncome under the treaty; for there is no stipulation in that doing away the\r\nlaws of alienage, and enabling the members of each nation to inherit or\r\nhold lands in the other.\r\n\r\nSec. 15. _Delaware._--This State, in the year 1778, passed an act of\r\nconfiscation against forty-six citizens, by name, who had joined in arms\r\nagainst them, unless they should come in by a given day, and stand their\r\ntrial. The estates of those who did not, were sold, and the whole business\r\nsoon closed. They never passed any other act on the subject, either before\r\nor after the peace. There was no restitution, because there was nothing to\r\nrestore, their debts having more than exhausted the proceeds of the sales\r\nof their property, as appears by Mr. Read's letter, and that all persons\r\nwere permitted to return, and such as chose it, have remained there in\r\nquiet to this day.\r\n\r\nSec. 16. _Pennsylvania._--The catalogue furnishes no transaction of this\r\nState subsequent to the arrival of the treaty of peace, on the subject\r\nof confiscation, except 1790, August. An order of the executive council\r\nto sell part of Harry Gordon's real estate, under the act of January 31,\r\n1783. This person had been summoned by proclamation, by the name of Henry\r\nGordon, to appear before the first day of November, 1781, and failing,\r\nhis estate was seized by the commissioners of forfeitures, and most of\r\nit sold. The act of 1783, January 31, cured the misnomer, and directed\r\nwhat remained of his estate to be sold. The confiscation being complete,\r\nit was for them to say whether they would restore it, in compliance with\r\nthe recommendation of Congress. They did not, and the executive completed\r\nthe sale, as they were bound to do. All persons were permitted to return\r\nto this State, and you see many of them living here to this day in quiet\r\nand esteem.\r\n\r\nSec. 17. _New Jersey._--The only act alleged against this State, as to\r\nthe recommendatory article, is,\r\n\r\n1783, December 23, An act to appropriate certain forfeited estates. This\r\nwas the estate of John Zabriski, which had been forfeited during the war,\r\nand the act gives it to Major-General Baron Steuben, in reward for his\r\nservices. The confiscation being complete, the Legislature were free to\r\ndo this. Governor Livingston's letter is an additional testimony of the\r\nmoderation of this State, after the proclamation of peace, and from that\r\nwe have a right to conclude, that no persons were prevented from returning\r\nand remaining indefinitely.\r\n\r\nSec. 18. _New York._--This State had been among the first invaded; the\r\ngreatest part of it had been possessed by the enemy through the war; it\r\nwas the last evacuated; its inhabitants had in great numbers been driven\r\noff their farms; their property wasted, and themselves living in exile and\r\npenury, and reduced from affluence to want, it is not to be wondered at,\r\nif their sensations were among the most lively; accordingly, they, in the\r\nvery first moment, gave a flat refusal to the recommendation, as to the\r\nrestoration of property. See document No. 17, containing their reasons.\r\nThey passed, however, 1784, May 12, the act to preserve the freedom and\r\nindependence of this State, and for other purposes therein mentioned,\r\nin which, after disqualifying refugees from offices, they permit them to\r\ncome, and remain as long as may be absolutely necessary to defend their\r\nestates.\r\n\r\nSec. 19. _Connecticut._--A single act only on the same subject is alleged\r\nagainst this State, after the treaty of peace. This was\r\n\r\n1790, An act directing certain confiscated estates to be sold. The title\r\nshows they were old confiscations, not new ones, and Governor Huntington's\r\nletter informs us, that all confiscations and prosecutions were stopped on\r\nthe peace; that some restorations of property took place, and all persons\r\nwere free to return.\r\n\r\nSec. 20. _Rhode Island._--The titles of four acts of this State are cited\r\nin your Appendix, to wit:\r\n\r\n1783, May 27, An act to send out of the State N. Spink and I. Underwood,\r\nwho had formerly joined the enemy, and were returned to Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n1783, June 8, An act to send William Young, theretofore banished out of\r\nthe State, and forbidden to return at his peril.\r\n\r\n1783, June 12, An act allowing William Brenton, late an absentee, to visit\r\nhis family for one week, then sent away, not to return.\r\n\r\n1783, October, An act to banish S. Knowles (whose estate had been\r\nforfeited), on pain of death if he return. Mr. Channing, the attorney of\r\nthe United States for that district, says, in his letter, \"he had sent\r\nme all the acts of that Legislature, that affect either the debts, or the\r\npersons of British subjects, or American refugees.\" The acts above cited\r\nare not among them. In the answer of April 6, which you were pleased to\r\ngive to mine of March 30, desiring copies of these, among other papers,\r\nyou say the book is no longer in your possession. These circumstances\r\nwill, I hope, excuse my not answering or admitting these acts, and justify\r\nmy proceeding to observe, that nothing is produced against this State on\r\nthe subject, after the treaty; and the district attorney's letter, before\r\ncited, informs us, that their courts considered the treaty as paramount\r\nto the laws of the State, and decided accordingly, both as to persons\r\nand property, and that the estates of all British subjects, seized by\r\nthe State, had been restored, and the rents and profits accounted for.\r\nGovernor Collins' letter, No. 20, is a further evidence of the compliance\r\nof this State.\r\n\r\nSec. 21. _Massachusetts._--1784, March 24. This State passed an act for\r\nrepealing two laws of this State, and for asserting the right of this free\r\nand sovereign commonwealth to expel such aliens as may be dangerous to the\r\npeace and good order of government, the effect of which was to reject the\r\nrecommendation of Congress, as to the return of persons, but to restore to\r\nthem such of their lands as were not confiscated, unless they were pledged\r\nfor debt; and by--\r\n\r\n1784, November 10, An act in addition to an act for repealing two laws of\r\nthis State, they allowed them to redeem their lands pledged for debt, by\r\npaying the debt.\r\n\r\nSec. 22. _New Hampshire._--Against New Hampshire nothing is alleged; that\r\nState having not been invaded at all, was not induced to exercise any acts\r\nof right against the subjects or adherents of their enemies.\r\n\r\nThe acts, then, which have been complained of as violations of the 5th\r\narticle, were such as the States were free to pass, notwithstanding the\r\nrecommendation; such as it was well understood they would be free to pass\r\nwithout any imputation of infraction, and may therefore be put entirely\r\nout of question.\r\n\r\nSec. 23. And we may further observe, with respect to the same acts, that\r\nthey have been considered as infractions not only of the 5th article,\r\nwhich recommended the restoration of the confiscations which _had taken\r\nplace during the war_, but also of that part of the 6th article which\r\nforbade _future_ confiscations. But not one of them touched an estate\r\nwhich had not been before confiscated; for you will observe, that an act\r\nof the Legislature, confiscating lands, stands in place of _an office\r\nfound_ in ordinary cases; and that, _on the passage of the act_, as _on\r\nthe finding of the office_, the State stands, _ipso facto_, possessed\r\nof the lands, without a formal entry. The confiscation then is complete\r\nby the passage of the act. Both the title and possession being divested\r\nout of the former proprietor, and vested in the State, no subsequent\r\nproceedings relative to the lands are acts of confiscation, but are mere\r\nexercises of ownership, whether by levying profits, conveying for a time,\r\nby lease, or in perpetuo, by an absolute deed. I believe, therefore, it\r\nmay be said with truth, that there was not a single confiscation made\r\nin any one of the United States, after notification of the treaty; and,\r\nconsequently, it will not be necessary to notice again this part of the\r\n6th article.\r\n\r\nSec. 24. Before quitting the recommendatory article, two passages in the\r\nletter are to be noted, which, applying to all the States in general,\r\ncould not have been properly answered under any one of them in particular.\r\nIn page 16 is the following passage: \"The express provision in the treaty,\r\nfor the restitution of the estates and properties of persons of both these\r\ndescriptions [British subjects and Americans who had stayed within the\r\nBritish lines, but had not borne arms] certainly comprehended a virtual\r\nacquiescence in their right to reside where their property was situated,\r\nand to be restored to the privileges of citizenship.\" Here seems to be a\r\ndouble error, first in supposing an express provision, whereas the words\r\nof the article, and the collateral testimony adduced, have shown that\r\nthe provision was neither _express_, nor meant to be so. And secondly, in\r\ninferring, from a restitution of the estate, a virtual acquiescence in the\r\nright of the party to reside where the estate is. Nothing is more frequent\r\nthan for a sovereign to banish the person, and leave him possessed of his\r\nestate. The inference in the present case, too, is contradicted, as to\r\nthe _refugees_, by the recommendation to permit their residence twelve\r\nmonths; and as to British subjects, by the silence of the article, and the\r\nimprobability that the British plenipotentiary meant to stipulate a right\r\nfor British subjects to emigrate and become members of another community.\r\n\r\nSec. 25. Again, in page 34, it is said, \"The nation of Great Britain has\r\nbeen involved in the payment to them of no less a sum than four millions\r\nsterling, as a partial compensation for the losses they had sustained.\"\r\nIt has been before proved, that Mr. Oswald understood perfectly, that\r\nno indemnification was claimable from us; that, on the contrary, we had\r\na counter claim of indemnification to much larger amount. It has been\r\nsupposed, and not without grounds, that the glimmering of hope, provided\r\nby the recommendatory article, was to quiet, for the present, the clamors\r\nof the sufferers, and to keep their weight out of the scale of opposition\r\nto the peace, trusting to time and events for an oblivion of these claims,\r\nor a gradual ripening of the public mind to meet and satisfy them at a\r\nmoment of less embarrassment: the latter is the turn which the thing took.\r\nThe claimants continued their importunities, and the Government determined\r\nat length to indemnify them for their losses; and, open-handedly as they\r\nwent to work, it cost them less than to have settled with us the just\r\naccount of mutual indemnification urged by our commissioners. It may be\r\nwell doubted, whether there were not single States of our Union to which\r\nthe four millions you have paid would have been no indemnification for\r\nthe losses of property sustained contrary even to the laws of war; and\r\nwhat sum would have indemnified the whole thirteen, and, consequently,\r\nto what sum our whole losses of this description have amounted, would be\r\ndifficult to say. However, though in nowise interested in the sums you\r\nthought proper to give to the refugees, we could not be inattentive to\r\nthe measure in which they were dealt out. Those who were on the spot,\r\nand who knew intimately the state of affairs with the individuals of this\r\ndescription, who knew that their debts often exceeded their possessions,\r\ninsomuch that the most faithful administration made them pay but a few\r\nshillings in the pound, heard with wonder of the sums given, and could not\r\nbut conclude, that those largesses were meant for something more than loss\r\nof property--that services and other circumstances must have had great\r\ninfluence. The sum paid is therefore no imputation on us. We have borne\r\nour own losses. We have even lessened yours, by numerous restitutions,\r\nwhere circumstances admitted them; and we have much the worst of the\r\nbargain by the alternative you choose to accept, of indemnifying your own\r\nsufferers, rather than ours.\r\n\r\nSec. 26. II. The article of debts is next in order; but to place on their\r\ntrue grounds our proceedings relative to them, it will be necessary to\r\ntake a view of the British proceedings, which are the subject of complaint\r\nin my letter of December 15.\r\n\r\nIn the 7th article, it was stipulated, that his Britannic Majesty should\r\nwithdraw his armies, garrisons, and fleets, without carrying away any\r\nnegroes, or other property of the American inhabitants. This stipulation\r\nwas known to the British commanding officers, before the 19th of March,\r\n1783, as _provisionally_ agreed; and on the 5th of April they received\r\nofficial notice from their court of the conclusion and ratification of\r\nthe preliminary articles between France, Spain, and Great Britain, which\r\ngave activity to ours, as appears by the letter of Sir Guy Carleton to\r\nGeneral Washington, dated April 6, 1783. Document No. 21. From this time,\r\nthen, surely, no negroes could be carried away without a violation of the\r\ntreaty. Yet we find that, so early as May 6, a _large_ number of them\r\nhad already been embarked for Nova Scotia, of which, as contrary to an\r\nexpress stipulation in the treaty, General Washington declared to him his\r\nsense and surprise. In the letter of Sir Guy Carleton of May 12 (annexed\r\nto mine to you of the 15th of December), he admits the fact; palliates it\r\nby saying he had no right to deprive the negroes of that liberty he found\r\nthem _possessed_ of; that it was unfriendly to suppose that the King's\r\nminister could stipulate to be guilty of a notorious breach of the public\r\nfaith towards the negroes; and that, _if it was his intention, it must be\r\nadjusted by compensation_, restoration being utterly impracticable, where\r\ninseparable from a breach of public faith. But surely, sir, an officer\r\nof the King is not to question the validity of the King's engagements,\r\nnor violate his solemn treaties, on his own scruples about the public\r\nfaith. Under this pretext, however, General Carleton went on in daily\r\ninfractions, embarking, from time to time, between his notice of the\r\ntreaty and the 5th of April, and the evacuation of New York, November\r\n25, 3,000 negroes, of whom our commissioners had inspection, and a very\r\nlarge number more, in public and private vessels, of whom they were not\r\npermitted to have inspection. Here, then, was a direct, unequivocal and\r\navowed violation of this part of the 7th article, in the first moments\r\nof its being known; an article which had been of extreme solicitude on\r\nour part, on the fulfilment of which depended the means of paying debts,\r\nin proportion to the number of laborers withdrawn; and when, in the very\r\nact of violation, we warn, and put the commanding officer on his guard,\r\nhe says, directly, he will go through with the act, and leave it to his\r\ncourt to adjust it by compensation.\r\n\r\nSec. 27. By the same article, his Britannic Majesty stipulates, that he\r\nwill, _with all convenient speed_, withdraw his garrisons from _every_\r\npost within the United States. \"When no precise term,\" says a writer\r\non the Law of Nations [Vattel, 1. 4. c. 26.], \"has been marked for the\r\naccomplishment of a treaty, and for the execution of each of its articles,\r\ngood sense determines that every point should be executed _as soon as\r\npossible_. This is, without doubt, what was understood.\"[11] The term\r\nin the treaty, _with all convenient speed_, amounts to the same thing,\r\nand clearly excludes all unnecessary delay. The general pacification\r\nbeing signed on the 20th of January, some time would be requisite for the\r\norders for evacuation to come over to America, for the removal of stores,\r\nproperty, and persons, and finally for the act of evacuation. The larger\r\nthe post, the longer the time necessary to remove all its contents; the\r\nsmaller, the sooner done. Hence, though General Carleton received his\r\norders to evacuate New York in the month of April, the evacuation was\r\nnot completed till late in November. It had been the principal place of\r\narms and stores; the seat, as it were, of their general government, and\r\nthe asylum of those who had fled to them. A great quantity of shipping\r\nwas necessary, therefore, for the removal, and the General was obliged to\r\ncall for a part from foreign countries. These causes of delay were duly\r\nrespected on our part. But the posts of Michillimackinac,[12] Detroit,\r\nNiagara, Oswego, Oswegatchie, Point-au-Fer, Dutchman's Point, were not of\r\nthis magnitude. The orders for evacuation, which reached General Carleton,\r\nin New York, early in April, might have gone, in one month more, to the\r\nmost remote of these posts. Some of them might have been evacuated in a\r\nfew days after, and the largest in a few weeks. Certainly they might all\r\nhave been delivered, without any _inconvenient speed_ in the operations,\r\nby the end of May, from the known facility furnished by the lakes, and\r\nthe water connecting them; or by crossing immediately over into their\r\nown territory, and availing themselves of the season for making new\r\nestablishments there, if that was intended. Or whatever time might, in\r\nevent, have been necessary for their evacuation, certainly the order for\r\nit should have been given from England, and might have been given as early\r\nas that from New York. Was any order ever given? Would not an _unnecessary\r\ndelay_ of the order, producing an equal delay in the evacuation, be an\r\ninfraction of the treaty? Let us investigate this matter.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of August, 1783, Major-General Baron Steuben, by orders from\r\nGeneral Washington, having repaired to Canada for this purpose, wrote the\r\nletter No. 22 to General Haldimand, Governor of the province, and received\r\nfrom him the answer of August 13, No. 23. Wherein he says, \"The orders I\r\nhave received, direct a discontinuance of every hostile measure _only_,\"\r\n&c. And in his conference with Baron Steuben, he says expressly, \"That\r\nhe _had not received any orders_ for making the least arrangements for\r\nthe evacuation of a single post.\" The orders, then, which might have been\r\nwith him by the last of April, were unknown, if they existed, the middle\r\nof August. See Baron Steuben's letter, No. 24.\r\n\r\nAgain, on the 19th of March, 1784, Governor Clinton, of New York, within\r\nthe limits of which State some of these posts are, writes to General\r\nHaldimand, the letter No. 25; and that General, answering him, May 10,\r\nfrom Quebec, says, \"Not having had the honor _to receive orders_ and\r\ninstructions relative to withdrawing the garrisons,\" &c.; fourteen months\r\nwere now elapsed, and the _orders not yet received_, which might have been\r\nreceived in four.\r\n\r\nAgain, on the 12th of July, Colonel Hull, by order from General Knox,\r\nthe Secretary of War, writes to General Haldimand, the letter No. 27;\r\nand General Haldimand gives the answer of the 13th, No. 28, wherein\r\nhe says, \"Though I am now informed, by his Majesty's ministers, of the\r\nratification, &c., I remain, &c., _not having received any orders_ to\r\nevacuate the posts which are without the limits,\" &c. And this is eighteen\r\nmonths after the signature of the general pacification! Now, is it not\r\nfair to conclude, if the order was not arrived on the 13th of August,\r\n1783, if it was not arrived on the 10th of May, 1784, nor yet on the\r\n13th of July, in the same year, that, in truth, the order had never been\r\ngiven? and if it had never been given, may we not conclude that it never\r\nhad been intended to be given? From what moment is it we are to date\r\nthis infraction? From that, at which, with convenient speed, the order to\r\nevacuate the upper posts might have been given. No legitimate reason can\r\nbe assigned, why that order might not have been given as early, and at\r\nthe same time, as the order to evacuate New York; and _all delay, after\r\nthis, was in contravention of the treaty_.\r\n\r\nSec. 28. Was this delay merely innocent and unimportant to us, setting\r\naside all considerations but of interest and safety? 1. It cut us off from\r\nthe fur-trade, which before the war had been always of great importance\r\nas a branch of commerce, and as a source of remittance for the payment\r\nof our debts to Great Britain; for the injury of withholding our posts,\r\nthey added the obstruction of all passage along the lakes and their\r\ncommunications. 2. It secluded us from connection with the northwestern\r\nIndians, from all opportunity of keeping up with them friendly and\r\nneighborly intercourse, brought on us consequently, from their known\r\ndispositions, constant and expensive war, in which numbers of men,\r\nwomen, and children, have been, and still are, daily falling victims\r\nto the scalping knife, and to which there will be no period, but in our\r\npossession of the posts which command their country.\r\n\r\nIt may safely be said, then, that the treaty was violated in England,\r\nbefore it was known in America, and in America, as soon as it was known,\r\nand that too, in points so essential, as that, without them, it would\r\nnever have been concluded.\r\n\r\nSec. 29. And what was the effect of these infractions on the American\r\nmind? On the breach of any article of a treaty by the one party, the\r\nother has its election to declare it dissolved in all its articles, or to\r\ncompensate itself by withholding execution of equivalent articles; or to\r\nwaive notice of the breach altogether.\r\n\r\nCongress being informed that the British commanding officer was carrying\r\naway the negroes from New York, in avowed violation of the treaty, and\r\nagainst the repeated remonstrances of General Washington, they take up\r\nthe subject on the 26th of May, 1783; they declare that it is contrary\r\nto the treaty; direct that the proper papers be sent to their ministers\r\nplenipotentiary in Europe to remonstrate, and demand reparation, and\r\nthat, in the meantime, General Washington continue his remonstrances to\r\nthe British commanding officer, and insist on the discontinuance of the\r\nmeasure. See document No. 29.\r\n\r\nSec. 30. The State of Virginia, materially affected by this infraction,\r\nbecause the laborers thus carried away were chiefly from thence, while\r\nheavy debts were now to be paid to the very nation which was depriving\r\nthem of the means, took up the subject in December, 1783, that is to say,\r\nseven months after that particular infraction, and four months after the\r\nfirst refusal to deliver up the posts, and instead of arresting the debts\r\nabsolutely, in reprisal for their negroes carried away, they passed [D.\r\n5.] the act to revive and continue the several acts for suspending the\r\nissuing executions on certain judgments until December, 1783, that is to\r\nsay, they revived, till their next meeting, two acts passed during the\r\nwar, which suspended all _voluntary and fraudulent_ assignments of debt,\r\nand as to _others_, allowed real and personal estate to be tendered in\r\ndischarge of executions; the effect of which was to relieve the body\r\nof the debtor from prison, by authorizing him to deliver property in\r\ndischarge of the debt. In June following, thirteen months after the\r\nviolation last mentioned, and after a second refusal by the British\r\ncommanding officer to deliver up the posts, they came to the resolution\r\nNo. 30, reciting specially the infraction respecting their negroes,\r\ninstructing their delegates in Congress to press for reparation; and\r\nresolving, that the courts shall be opened to British suits, as soon as\r\n_reparation shall be made_, or otherwise, _as soon as Congress shall judge\r\nit indispensably necessary_. And in 1787, they passed [C. 7.] the act to\r\nrepeal so much of all and every act or acts of assembly, as prohibits the\r\nrecovery of British debts; and, at the same time [E. 6.] the act to repeal\r\npart of an act for the protection and encouragement of the commerce of\r\nnations acknowledging the independence of the United States of America.\r\nThe former was not to be in force till the evacuation of the posts, and\r\nreparation for the negroes carried away. The latter requires particular\r\nexplanation. The small supplies of European goods, which reached us during\r\nthe war, were frequently brought by captains of vessels and supercargoes,\r\nwho, as soon as they had sold their goods, were to return to Europe with\r\ntheir vessels. To persons under such circumstances, it was necessary to\r\ngive a summary remedy for the recovery of the proceeds of their sale.\r\nThis had been done by the law for the protection and encouragement of the\r\ncommerce of nations acknowledging the independence of the United States,\r\nwhich was meant but as a temporary thing, to continue while the same\r\ncircumstances continued. On the return of peace, the supplies of foreign\r\ngoods were made, as before the war, by merchants resident here. There was\r\nno longer reason to continue to them the summary remedy, which had been\r\nprovided for the transient vender of goods. And, indeed, it would have\r\nbeen unequal to have given the resident merchant instantaneous judgment\r\nagainst a farmer or tradesman, while the farmer or tradesman, could pursue\r\nthose who owed him money but in the ordinary way, and with the ordinary\r\ndelay. The British creditor had no such unequal privilege while we were\r\nunder British government, and had no title to it, in justice, or by the\r\ntreaty, after the war. When the Legislature proceeded, then, to repeal\r\nthe law, as to other nations, it would have been extraordinary to have\r\ncontinued it for Great Britain.\r\n\r\nSec. 31. South Carolina was the second State which moved in consequence\r\nof the British infractions, urged thereto by the desolated condition in\r\nwhich their armies had left that country, by the debts they owed, and the\r\nalmost entire destruction of the means of paying them. They passed [D.\r\n7. 20.] 1784, March 26th, an ordinance respecting the recovery of debts,\r\nsuspending the recovery of all actions, as well American as British, for\r\nnine months, and then allowing them to recover payment at four equal and\r\nannual instalments only, requiring the debtor in the meantime, to give\r\ngood security for his debt, or otherwise refusing him the benefit of the\r\nact, by--\r\n\r\n[D. 21.] 1787, March 28, An act to regulate the recovery and payment of\r\ndebts, and prohibiting the importation of negroes, they extended the\r\ninstalments, a year further in a very few cases. I have not been able\r\nto procure the two following acts [D. 14.] 1785, October 12th, An act\r\nfor regulating sales under executions, and for other purposes therein\r\nmentioned; and\r\n\r\n[D. 22.] 1788, Nov. 4, An act to regulate the payment and recovery of\r\ndebts, and to prohibit the importation of negroes for the time therein\r\nlimited; and I know nothing of their effect, or their existence, but\r\nfrom your letter, which says, their effect was to deliver property in\r\nexecution, in relief of the body of the debtor, and still further to\r\npostpone the instalments. If, during the existence of material infractions\r\non the part of Great Britain, it were necessary to apologize for these\r\nmodifications of the proceedings of the debtor, grounds might be found\r\nin the peculiar distresses of that State, and the liberality with which\r\nthey had complied with the recommendatory articles, notwithstanding\r\ntheir sufferings might have inspired other dispositions, having pardoned\r\neverybody, received everybody, restored all confiscated lands not sold,\r\nand the prices of those sold.\r\n\r\nSec. 32. Rhode Island next acted on the British infractions, and imposed\r\nmodifications in favor of such debtors as should be pursued by their\r\ncreditors, permitting them to relieve their bodies from execution by the\r\npayment of paper money, or delivery of property. This was the effect of\r\n[D. 12.] 1786, March, An act to enable any debtor in jail, on execution\r\nat the suit of any creditor, to tender real, or certain specified articles\r\nof personal estate; and\r\n\r\n[D. 16.] 1786, May, An act making paper money a legal tender. But observe,\r\nthat this was not till _three years_ after the infractions by Great\r\nBritain, and repeated and constant refusals of compliance on their part.\r\n\r\nSec. 33. New Jersey did the same thing, by--\r\n\r\n[D. 13.] 1786, March 23, An act to direct the modes of proceedings on\r\nwrits on _fieri facias_, and for transferring lands and chattels for\r\npayment of debts; and\r\n\r\n[D. 18.] 1786, May 26, An act for striking, and making current £100,000\r\nin bills of credit, to be let out on loan; and\r\n\r\n[D. 17.] 1786, June 1, An act for making bills, emitted by the act for\r\nraising a revenue of £31,259 5_s._ per annum, for twenty-five years, a\r\nlegal tender; and\r\n\r\nSec. 34. Georgia, by [D. 19.] 1786, August 14, An act for emitting the\r\nsum of £50,000 in bills of credit, and for establishing a fund for the\r\nredemption, and for other purposes therein mentioned, made paper money\r\nalso a legal tender.\r\n\r\nThese are the only States which appear, by the acts cited in your letter,\r\nto have modified the recovery of debts. But I believe that North Carolina\r\nalso emitted a sum of paper money and made it a tender in discharge of\r\nexecutions; though, not having seen the act, I cannot affirm it with\r\ncertainty. I have not mentioned, because I do not view the act of Maryland\r\n[D. 15.] 1786, Nov. c. 29, for the settlement of public accounts, &c., as\r\na modification of the recovery of debts. It obliged the British subject,\r\nbefore he could recover what was due to him within the State, to give\r\nbond for the payment of what he owed therein. It is reasonable that every\r\none, who asks justice, should do justice; and it is usual to consider the\r\nproperty of a foreigner, in any country, as a fund appropriated to the\r\npayment of what he owes in that country, exclusively. It is a care which\r\nmost nations take of their own citizens, not to let the property, which\r\nis to answer their demands, be withdrawn from its jurisdiction, and send\r\nthem to seek it in foreign countries, and before foreign tribunals.\r\n\r\nSec. 35. With respect to the obstacles thus opposed to the British\r\ncreditor, besides their general justification, as being produced by the\r\nprevious infractions on the part of Great Britain, each of them admits of\r\na special apology. They are, 1st. Delay of judgment; 2d. Liberating the\r\nbody from execution, on the delivery of property; 3d. Admitting executions\r\nto be discharged in paper money. As to the 1st, let it be considered,\r\nthat, from the nature of the commerce carried on between these States\r\nand Great Britain, they were generally kept in debt; that a great part\r\nof the country, and most particularly Georgia, South Carolina, North\r\nCarolina, Virginia, New York, and Rhode Island, had been ravaged by an\r\nenemy, movable property carried off, houses burnt, lands abandoned, the\r\nproprietors forced off into exile and poverty. When the peace permitted\r\nthem to return again to their lands, naked and desolate as they were,\r\nwas instant payment practicable? The contrary was so palpable, that the\r\nBritish creditors themselves were sensible that, were they to rush to\r\njudgment immediately against their debtors, it would involve the debtor\r\nin total ruin, without relieving the creditor. It is a fact, for which\r\nwe may appeal to the knowledge of one member at least of the British\r\nadministration of 1783, that the chairman of the North American merchants,\r\nconferring on behalf of those merchants with the American ministers\r\nthen in London, was so sensible that time was necessary as well to save\r\nthe creditor as debtor, that he declared there would not be a moment's\r\nhesitation, on the part of the creditors, to allow payment by instalments\r\nannually for seven years, and that this arrangement was not made, was\r\nneither his fault nor ours.\r\n\r\nTo the necessities for some delay in the payment of debts may be added\r\nthe British commercial regulations, lessening our means of payment, by\r\nprohibiting us from carrying in our own bottoms our own produce to their\r\ndominions in our neighborhood, and excluding valuable branches of it from\r\ntheir home markets by prohibitory duties. The means of payment constitute\r\none of the motives to purchase, at the moment of purchasing. If these\r\nmeans are taken away, by the creditor himself, he ought not in conscience\r\nto complain of a mere retardation of his debt, which is the effect of his\r\nown act, and the least injurious to those it is capable of producing. The\r\ninstalment acts before enumerated have been much less general, and for\r\na shorter term than what the chairman of the American merchants thought\r\nreasonable. Most of them required the debtor to give security, in the\r\nmeantime, to his creditor, and provided complete indemnification of the\r\ndelay by the payment of interest, which was enjoined in every case.\r\n\r\nSec. 36. The second species of obstacle was the admitting the debtor to\r\nrelieve his body from imprisonment, by the delivery of lands or goods to\r\nhis creditor. And is this idea original, and peculiar to us? or whence\r\nhave we taken it? From England, from Europe, from natural right and\r\nreason. For it may be safely affirmed, that neither natural right nor\r\nreason subjects the body of a man to restraint for debt. It is one of\r\nthe abuses introduced by commerce and credit, and which even the most\r\ncommercial nations have been obliged to relax, in certain cases. The\r\nRoman law, the principles of which are the nearest to natural reason of\r\nthose of any municipal code hitherto known, allowed imprisonment of the\r\nbody in criminal cases only, or those wherein the party had expressly\r\nsubmitted himself to it. The French laws allow it only in criminal or\r\ncommercial cases. The laws of England, in certain descriptions of cases\r\n(as bankruptcy) release the body. Many of the United States do the\r\nsame in all cases, on a cession of property by the debtor. The _levari\r\nfacias_, an execution affording only the _profits of lands_, is the\r\nonly one allowed in England, in certain cases. The _elegit_, another\r\nexecution of that and this country, attaches first on a man's chattels,\r\nwhich are not to be sold, but to be _delivered to the plaintiff_, on a\r\n_reasonable appraisement_, in part of satisfaction for his debt, and if\r\nnot sufficient, one half only of his lands are then to be delivered to the\r\nplaintiff, till the _profits_ shall have satisfied him. The tender laws of\r\nthese States were generally more favorable than the execution by _elegit_,\r\nbecause they not only gave, as that does, the whole property in chattels,\r\nbut also _the whole property_ in the lands, and not merely the _profits_\r\nof them. It is, therefore, an execution framed on the model of the English\r\n_elegit_, or rather an amendment of that writ, taking away, indeed, the\r\nelection of the party against the _body_ of his debtor, but giving him,\r\nin exchange for it, much more complete remedy against his _lands_. Let it\r\nbe observed, too, that this proceeding was allowed against citizens, as\r\nwell as foreigners; and it may be questioned, whether the treaty is not\r\nsatisfied, while the same measure is dealt out to British subjects, as to\r\nforeigners of all other nations, and to natives themselves. For it would\r\nseem, that all a friend can expect, is to be treated as a native citizen.\r\n\r\nSec. 37. The third obstacle was the allowing paper money to be paid for\r\ngoods sold under execution. The complaint on this head is only against\r\nGeorgia, South Carolina, Jersey, and Rhode Island; and this obstruction,\r\nlike the two others, sprung out of the peculiar nature of the war; for\r\nthose will form very false conclusions, who reason, as to this war, from\r\nthe circumstances which have attended other wars, and other nations. When\r\nany nation of Europe is attacked by another, it has neighbors, with whom\r\nits accustomary commerce goes on, without interruption; and its commerce\r\nwith more distant nations is carried on by sea, in foreign bottoms, at\r\nleast under protection of the laws of neutrality. The produce of its soil\r\ncan be exchanged for money, as usual, and the stock of that medium of\r\ncirculation is not at all diminished by war; so that property sells as\r\nreadily and as well, for real money, at the close, as at the commencement\r\nof the war. But how different was our case: on the north and south, were\r\nour enemies; on the west, deserts inhabited by savages in league with\r\nthem; on the east, an ocean of one thousand leagues, beyond which, indeed,\r\nwere nations, who might have purchased the produce of our soil, and have\r\ngiven us real money in exchange, and thus kept up our stock of money, but\r\nwho were deterred from coming to us by threats of war on the part of our\r\nenemies, if they should presume to consider us as a people, entitled to\r\npartake the benefit of that law of war, which allows commerce with neutral\r\nnations. What were the consequences? The stock of hard money, which we\r\npossessed in an ample degree, at the beginning of the war, soon flowed\r\ninto Europe for supplies of arms, ammunition, and other necessaries, which\r\nwe were not in the habit of manufacturing for ourselves. The produce of\r\nour soil, attempted to be carried in our own bottoms to Europe, fell,\r\ntwo-thirds of it, into the hands of our enemies, who were masters of the\r\nsea; the other third illy sufficed to procure the necessary implements\r\nof war; so that no returns of money supplied the place of that which had\r\ngone off. We were reduced, then, to the resource of a paper medium, and\r\nthat completed the exile of the hard money; so that, in the latter stages\r\nof the war, we were, for years together, without seeing a single coin of\r\nthe precious metals in circulation. It was closed with a stipulation that\r\nwe should pay a large mass of debt, in such coin. If the whole soil of\r\nthe United States had been offered for sale for ready coin, it would not\r\nhave raised as much as would have satisfied this stipulation. The thing,\r\nthen, was impossible, and reason and authority declare, \"Si l'empêchement\r\nest reel, il faut donner du tems; car nul n'est tenu a l'impossible.\"[13]\r\nVattel, l. 4, s. 51. We should, with confidence, have referred the\r\ncase to the arbiter proposed by another jurist, who lays it down that a\r\nparty, \"Non ultra obligari, quam in quantum facere potest; et an possit,\r\npermittendum alterius principis, quo boni viri arbitrio.\"[14] Bynk. Q.\r\nJ. P. l. 2, c. 10. That four of the States should resort, under such\r\ncircumstances, to very small emissions of paper money, is not wonderful;\r\nthat all did not, proves their firmness under sufferance, and that they\r\nwere disposed to bear whatever could be borne, rather than contravene,\r\neven by way of equivalent, stipulations which had been authoritatively\r\nentered into for them. And even in the four States, which emitted paper\r\nmoney, it was in such small sums, and so secured, as to suffer only a\r\nshort-lived, and not great depreciation of value; nor did they continue\r\nits quality as a tender, after the first paroxysms of distress were over.\r\nHere, too, it is to be observed, that natives were to receive this species\r\nof payment, equally with British subjects.\r\n\r\nSo that, when it is considered, that the other party had broken the\r\ntreaty, from the beginning, and that, too, in points which lessened\r\nour ability to pay their debts, it was a proof of the moderation of our\r\nnation, to make no other use of the opportunity of retaliation presented\r\nto them, than to indulge the debtors with that time for discharging their\r\ndebts, which their distresses called for, and the interests and the reason\r\nof their creditors approved.\r\n\r\nSec. 38. It is to be observed, that, during all this time, Congress,\r\nwho alone possessed the power of peace and war, of making treaties, and,\r\nconsequently, of declaring their infractions, had abstained from every\r\npublic declaration, and had confined itself to the resolution of May 26th,\r\n1783, and to repeated efforts, through their minister plenipotentiary at\r\nthe court of London, to lead that court into a compliance on their part,\r\nand reparation of the breach they had committed. But the other party now\r\nlaid hold of those very proceedings of our States, which their previous\r\ninfractions had produced, as a ground for further refusal; and inverting\r\nthe natural order of cause and effect, alleged that these proceedings\r\nof ours were the causes of the infractions, which they had committed\r\nmonths and years before. Thus the British minister for foreign affairs,\r\nin his answer of February 28th, 1786, to Mr. Adams' memorial, says, \"The\r\nengagements entered into by treaty ought to be mutual, and equally binding\r\non the respective contracting parties. It would, therefore, be the height\r\nof folly, as well as injustice, to suppose one party alone obliged to a\r\nstrict observance of the public faith, while the other might remain free\r\nto deviate from its own engagements, as often as convenience might render\r\nsuch deviation necessary, though at the expense of its own national credit\r\nand importance; I flatter myself, however, Sir, that justice will speedily\r\nbe done to British creditors; and I can assure you, Sir, that whenever\r\nAmerica shall manifest a real intention to fulfil her part of the treaty,\r\nGreat Britain will not hesitate to prove her sincerity to co-operate in\r\nwhatever points depend upon her, for carrying every article of it into\r\nreal and complete effect.\" Facts will furnish the best commentary on this\r\nletter. Let us pursue them.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the United States, by order of\r\nCongress, immediately wrote circular letters to the Governors of the\r\nseveral States, dated May 3, 1786, No. 31, to obtain information how far\r\nthey had complied with the proclamation of January 14th, 1784, and the\r\nrecommendation accompanying it; and April 13, 1787, Congress, desirous\r\nof removing every pretext which might continue to cloak the inexecution\r\nof the treaty, wrote a circular letter to the several States, in which,\r\nin order to produce more surely the effect desired, they demonstrate that\r\nCongress alone possess the right of interpreting, restraining, impeding,\r\nor counteracting the operation and execution of treaties, which, on\r\nbeing constitutionally made, become, by the confederation, a part of the\r\nlaw of the land, and, as such, independent of the will and power of the\r\nLegislatures; that, in this point of view, the State acts, establishing\r\nprovisions relative to the same objects, and incompatible with it, must be\r\nimproper; resolving that all such acts now existing ought to be forthwith\r\nrepealed, as well to prevent their continuing to be regarded as violations\r\nof the treaty, as to avoid the disagreeable necessity of discussing\r\ntheir validity; recommending, in order to obviate all future disputes and\r\nquestions, that every State, as well those which had passed no such acts\r\nas those which had, should pass an act, repealing, in general terms, all\r\nacts and parts of acts repugnant to the treaty; and encouraging them to\r\ndo this, by informing them that they had the strongest assurances that\r\nan exact compliance with the treaty on our part, would be followed by a\r\npunctual performance of it on the part of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nSec. 39. In consequence of these letters, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\nRhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and\r\nNorth Carolina, passed the acts Nos. 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39,\r\n40. New Jersey and Pennsylvania declared that no law existed with them\r\nrepugnant to the treaty--see documents Nos. 41, 42, 43. Georgia had no law\r\nexisting against the treaty. South Carolina, indeed, had a law existing,\r\nwhich subjected all persons, foreign or native, No. 44, to certain\r\nmodifications of recovery and payment. But the liberality of her conduct\r\non the other points is a proof she would have conformed in this also, had\r\nit appeared that the fullest conformity would have moved Great Britain to\r\ncompliance, and had an express repeal been really necessary.\r\n\r\nSec. 40. For indeed all this was supererogation. It resulted from the\r\ninstrument of confederation among the States, that treaties made by\r\nCongress, according to the confederation, were superior to the laws of the\r\nStates. The circular letter of Congress had declared and demonstrated it,\r\nand the several States, by their acts and explanations before mentioned,\r\nhad shown it to be their own sense, as we may safely affirm it to have\r\nbeen the general sense of those, at least, who were of the profession of\r\nthe law. Besides the proof of this, drawn from the act of confederation\r\nitself, the declaration of Congress, and the acts of the States before\r\nmentioned, the same principle will be found acknowledged in several of\r\nthe documents hereto annexed for other purposes. Thus, in Rhode Island,\r\nGovernor Collins, in his letter, No. 20, says, \"The treaty, in all _its\r\nabsolute parts_, has been fully complied with, and to those parts that are\r\nmerely _recommendatory_ and _depend upon the legislative discretion_, the\r\nmost candid attention hath been paid.\" Plainly implying that the _absolute\r\nparts_ did not _depend upon the legislative discretion_. Mr. Channing,\r\nthe attorney for the United States in that State, No. 19, speaking of\r\nan act passed before the treaty, says, \"This act was considered by\r\nour courts as _annulled by the treaty of peace_, and subsequent to\r\nthe ratification thereof no proceedings have been had thereon.\" The\r\nGovernor of Connecticut, in his letter, No 18, says, \"The sixth article\r\nof the treaty was immediately observed on receiving the same with the\r\nproclamation of Congress; the courts of justice adopted it _as a principle\r\nof law_. No further prosecutions were instituted against any person who\r\ncame within that article, and all such prosecutions as were then pending\r\nwere discontinued.\" Thus, prosecutions going on, under the law of the\r\nState, were discontinued, by the treaty operating as a repeal of the\r\nlaw. In Pennsylvania, Mr. Lewis, attorney for the United States, says, in\r\nhis letter, No. 60, \"The judges have, uniformly and without hesitation,\r\ndeclared in favor of the treaty, on the ground of its being the supreme\r\nlaw of the land. On this ground, they have not only discharged attainted\r\ntraitors from arrest, but have frequently declared that they were entitled\r\nby the treaty to protection.\" The case of the Commonwealth _vs._ Gordon,\r\nJanuary, 1788, Dallas' Reports, 233, is a proof of this. In Maryland, in\r\nthe case of Mildred _vs._ Dorsey, cited in your letter [E. 4.] a law of\r\nthe State, made during the war, had compelled those who owed debts to\r\nBritish subjects to pay them into the treasury of that State. This had\r\nbeen done by Dorsey, before the date of the treaty; yet the judges of\r\nthe _State_ general court decided that the treaty not only repealed the\r\nlaw for the future, but for the past also, and decreed that the defendant\r\nshould pay the money over again to the British creditor. In Virginia, Mr.\r\nMonroe, one of the Senators of that State in Congress, and a lawyer of\r\neminence, tells us, No. 52, that both court and counsel there avowed the\r\nopinion, that the treaty would control any law of the State opposed to it.\r\nAnd the Legislature itself, in an act of October, 1787, c. 36, concerning\r\nmoneys carried into the public loan office, in payment of British debts,\r\nuse these expressions: \"And whereas it belongs not to the Legislature to\r\ndecide particular questions, of which the judiciary have cognizance, and\r\nit is, therefore, unfit for them to determine whether the payments so made\r\ninto the loan office be good or void between the creditor and debtor.\" In\r\nNew York, Mr. Harrison, attorney for the United States in that district,\r\nassures us, No. 45, that the act of 1782, of that State, relative to the\r\ndebts due to persons within the enemy's line, was, immediately after the\r\ntreaty, restrained _by the superior courts of the State_ from operating\r\non British creditors, and that he did not know a single instance to the\r\ncontrary--a full proof that they considered the treaty as a law of the\r\nland, paramount to the law of their State.\r\n\r\nSec. 41. The very case of Rutgers, _vs._ Waddington, [E. 8.] which is a\r\nsubject of complaint in your letter, is a proof that the courts consider\r\nthe treaty as paramount to the laws of the States. Some parts of your\r\ninformation, as to that case, have been inexact. The State of New York\r\nhad, during the war, passed an act [C. 16.] declaring that, in any\r\naction by the proprietor of a house or tenement against the occupant,\r\nfor rent or damage, no military order should be a justification; and,\r\nMay 4, 1784, after the refusal of the British to deliver up the posts in\r\nthe State of New York, that Legislature revived the same act. [C. 19.]\r\nWaddington, a British subject, had occupied a brew-house in New York,\r\nbelonging to Rutgers, an American, while the British were in possession\r\nof New York. During a part of the time he had only permission from the\r\nquartermaster general; for another part he had an order of the commanding\r\nofficer to authorize his possession. After the evacuation of the city,\r\nRutgers, under the authority of this law of the State, brought an action\r\nagainst Waddington for rent and damages, in the Mayor's court of New\r\nYork. Waddington pleaded the treaty, and the court declared the treaty a\r\njustification, in opposition to the law of the State, for that portion\r\nof the time authorized by the commanding officer, his authority being\r\ncompetent, and gave judgment for that part in favor of the defendant;\r\nbut, for the time he held the house under permission of the quartermaster\r\ngeneral only, they gave judgment against the defendant, considering the\r\npermission of that officer incompetent, according to the regulations\r\nof the existing powers. From this part of the judgment the defendant\r\nappealed. The first part, however, was an unequivocal decision of the\r\nsuperior authority of the treaty over the law. The latter part could only\r\nhave been founded in an opinion of the sense of the treaty in that part\r\nof the 6th article which declares, \"There shall be no future prosecutions\r\nagainst any persons for the part he may have taken in the war, and that no\r\nperson should, on that account, suffer any future loss or damage in their\r\nproperty,\" &c. They must have understood this as only protecting actions\r\nwhich were conformable with the laws and authority existing at the time\r\nand place. The tenure of the defendant under the quartermaster general\r\nwas not so conformable. That under the commanding officer was. Some may\r\nthink that murders, and other crimes and offences, characterized as such\r\nby the authority of the time and place where committed, were meant to be\r\nprotected by this paragraph of the treaty; and, perhaps, for peace sake,\r\nthis construction may be the most convenient. The Mayor's court, however,\r\nseems to have revolted at it. The defendant appealed, and the question\r\nwould have been authoritatively decided by the superior court, had not an\r\namicable compromise taken place between the parties. See Mr. Hamilton's\r\nstatement of this case, No. 46.\r\n\r\nSec. 42. The same kind of doubt brought on the arrest of John Smith\r\nHatfield in New Jersey, whose case [E. 9.] is another ground of complaint\r\nin your letter. A refugee, sent out by the British as a spy, was taken\r\nwithin the American lines, regularly tried by a court martial, found\r\nguilty, and executed. There was one Ball, an inhabitant of the American\r\npart of Jersey, who, contrary to the laws of his country, was in the habit\r\nof secretly supplying the British camp in Staten Island with provisions.\r\nThe first time Ball went over, after the execution of the spy, of which\r\nit does not appear he had any knowledge, and certainly no agency in his\r\nprosecution, John Smith Hatfield, a refugee also from Jersey, and some\r\nothers of the same description, seized him, against the express orders\r\nof the British commanding officer, brought him out of the British lines,\r\nand Hatfield hung him with his own hands. The British officer sent a\r\nmessage to the Americans, disavowing this act, declaring that the British\r\nhad nothing to do with it, and that those who had perpetrated the crime\r\nought alone to suffer for it. The right to punish the guilty individual\r\nseems to have been yielded by the one party, and accepted by the other,\r\nin exchange for that of retaliation on an innocent person; an exchange\r\nwhich humanity would wish to see habitual. The criminal came afterwards\r\ninto the very neighborhood, a member of which he had murdered. Peace,\r\nindeed, had now been made; but the magistrate, thinking probably, that it\r\nwas for the honest soldier and citizen only, and not for the murderer, and\r\nsupposing, with the mayor's court of New York, that the paragraph of the\r\ntreaty against future persecutions meant to cover authorized acts only,\r\nand not murders and other atrocities, disavowed by the existing authority,\r\narrested Hatfield. At the court which met for his trial, the witnesses\r\nfailed to attend. The court released the criminal from confinement, on his\r\ngiving the security required by law for his appearance at another court.\r\nHe fled; and you say that, \"as his friends doubted the disposition of the\r\ncourt to determine according to the terms of the treaty, they thought it\r\nmore prudent to suffer the forfeiture of the recognizances, than to put\r\nhis life again into jeopardy.\" But your information in this, Sir, has not\r\nbeen exact. The recognizances are not forfeited. His friends, confident\r\nin the opinion of their counsel, and the integrity of the judges, have\r\ndetermined to plead the treaty, and not even give themselves the trouble\r\nof asking a release from the Legislature; and the case is now depending.\r\nSee the letter of Mr. Boudinot, member of Congress for Jersey, No. 47.\r\n\r\nSec. 43. In Georgia, Judge Walton, in a charge to a grand jury, says,\r\n\"The State of Rhode Island having acceded to the Federal Constitution, the\r\nUnion and Government have become complete. To comprehend the extent of the\r\nGeneral Government, and to discern the relation between that and those of\r\nthe States, will be equally our interest and duty. The Constitution, laws,\r\nand _treaties_ of the Union are _paramount_.\" And in the same State, in\r\ntheir last federal circuit court, we learn from the public papers, that,\r\nin a case wherein the plaintiffs were Brailsford and others, British\r\nsubjects, whose debts had been sequestered (not confiscated) by an act of\r\nthe State during the war, the judges declared the treaty of peace a repeal\r\nof the act of the State, and gave judgment for the plaintiffs.\r\n\r\nSec. 44. The integrity of those opinions and proceedings of the\r\nseveral courts should have shielded them from the insinuations hazarded\r\nagainst them. In pages 9 and 10, it is said, \"That during the war, the\r\nLegislatures passed laws to confiscate the estates of the loyalists,\r\nto enable debtors to pay into the State treasuries paper money, then\r\nexceedingly depreciated, in discharge of their debts.\" And page 24, \"The\r\ndispensations of law _by the State courts_ have been as unpropitious\r\nto the subjects of the crown, as the legislative acts of the different\r\nassemblies.\" Let us compare, if you please, Sir, these unpropitious\r\nopinions of our State courts with those of foreign lawyers' writing on\r\nthe same subject. [15]\"Quod dixi de actionibus recto publicandis ita\r\ndemum obtinet; si quod subditi nostri hostibus nostris debent, princeps\r\na subditis suis revera exegerit. Si exegerit, recte solutum est, si non\r\nexegerit, pace facta, reviviscit jus pristinum creditoris; secundum, hæc\r\ninter gentes fere convenit, ut nominibus bello publicatis, pace deinde\r\nfactâ, exacta censeantur periisse, et maneant extincta; non autem exacta\r\nreviviscant et restiuantur veris creditoribus.\" Bynk. Q. J. P. l. 1, c.\r\n7. But what said the judges of the State court of Maryland in the case\r\nof Mildred and Dorsey? That a debt forced from an American debtor into\r\nthe treasury of his sovereign, is not extinct, but shall be paid over\r\nagain to his British creditor. Which is most propitious, the unbiassed\r\nforeign jurist, or the American judge, charged with dispensing justice\r\nwith favor and partiality? But from this, you say, there is an appeal. Is\r\nthat the fault of the judge, or the fault of anybody? Is there a country\r\non earth, or ought there to be one, allowing no appeal from the first\r\nerrors of their courts? and if allowed from errors, how will those from\r\njust judgments be prevented? In England, as in other countries, an appeal\r\nis admitted to the party thinking himself injured; and here, had the\r\njudgment been against the British creditor, and an appeal denied, there\r\nwould have been better cause of complaint than for not having denied it\r\nto his adversary. If an _illegal_ judgment be ultimately rendered on the\r\nappeal, then will arise the right to question its propriety.\r\n\r\nSec. 45. Again it is said, page 34, \"In one State the _supreme federal\r\ncourt_ has thought proper to suspend for many months the final judgment\r\non an action of debt, brought by a British creditor.\" If by _the supreme\r\nfederal court_ be meant _the supreme court of the United States_, I\r\nhave had their records examined, in order to know what may be the case\r\nhere alluded to; and I am authorized to say, there neither does, nor\r\never did exist any cause before that court, between a British subject\r\nand a citizen of the United States. See the certificate of the clerk of\r\nthe court, No. 48. If by _the supreme federal court_ be meant _one of\r\nthe circuit courts of the United States_, then which circuit, in which\r\nState, and what case is meant? In the course of inquiries I have been\r\nobliged to make, to find whether there exists any case, in any district\r\nof any circuit court of the United States, which might have given rise to\r\nthis complaint, I have learnt, that an action was brought to issue, and\r\nargued in the circuit court of the United States, in Virginia, at their\r\nlast term, between Jones, a British subject, plaintiff, and Walker, an\r\nAmerican, defendant; wherein the question was the same as in the case of\r\nMildred and Dorsey, to wit; Whether a payment into the treasury, during\r\nthe war, under a law of the State, discharged the debtor? One of the\r\njudges retiring from court, in the midst of the argument, on the accident\r\nof the death of an only son, and the case being _primæ impressionis_ in\r\nthat court, it was adjourned, for consideration, till the ensuing term.\r\nHad the two remaining judges felt no motive but of predilection to one\r\nof the parties; had they considered only to which party their wishes were\r\npropitious or unpropitious; they possibly might have decided that question\r\non the spot. But, learned enough in their science to see difficulties\r\nwhich escape others, and having characters and consciences to satisfy,\r\nthey followed the example so habitually and so laudably set by the courts\r\nof your country, and of every country, where law, and not favor, is the\r\nrule of decision, of taking time to consider. Time and consideration are\r\nfavorable to the right cause, precipitation to the wrong one.\r\n\r\nSec. 46. You say again, p. 29, \"The few attempts to recover British debts,\r\nin the courts of Virginia, have _universally_ failed, and these are the\r\ncourts wherein, from the smallness of the sum, a considerable number of\r\ndebts can only be recovered.\" Again, p. 34, \"In the same State, county\r\ncourts (which alone can take cognizance of debts of limited amount) have\r\n_uniformly rejected_ all suits instituted for the recovery of sums due\r\nto the subjects of the crown of Great Britain.\" In the first place, the\r\ncounty courts, till of late, have had exclusive jurisdiction only of sums\r\nbelow 10_l._, and it is known, that a very inconsiderable proportion of\r\nthe British debt consists in demands below that sum. A late law, we are\r\ntold, requires, that actions below 30_l._ shall be commenced in those\r\ncourts; but allows, at the same time, an appeal to correct any errors into\r\nwhich they may fall. In the second place, the evidence of gentlemen who\r\nare in the way of knowing the fact, No. 52, 53, is, that though there have\r\nbeen accidental checks in some of the subordinate courts, arising from\r\nthe chicanery of the debtors, and sometimes, perhaps, a moment of error\r\nin the court itself, yet these particular instances have been immediately\r\nrectified, either in the same or the superior court, while the great mass\r\nof suits for the recovery of sums due to the subjects of the crown of\r\nGreat Britain, have been uniformly sustained to judgment and execution.\r\n\r\nSec. 47. A much broader assertion is hazarded, page 29. \"In some of the\r\nSouthern States, there does not exist a single instance of the recovery\r\nof British debt in their courts, though many years have expired since\r\nthe establishment of peace between the two countries.\" The particular\r\nStates are not specified. I have therefore thought it my duty to extend\r\nmy inquiries to all the States which could be designated under the\r\ndescription of Southern, to wit: Maryland, and those to the south of that.\r\n\r\nAs to Maryland, the joint certificate of the senators and delegates of\r\nthe State in Congress, the letter of Mr. Tilghman, a gentleman of the\r\nlaw in the same State, and that of Mr. Gwinn, clerk of their general\r\ncourt, prove that British suits have been maintained in the superior\r\nand inferior courts throughout the State without any obstruction; that\r\nBritish claimants have, in every instance, enjoyed every facility in the\r\ntribunals of justice equally with their own citizens; and have recovered\r\nin due course of law, and remitted large debts, as well under contracts\r\nprevious, as subsequent to the war.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia, the letters of Mr. Monroe and Mr. Giles, members of Congress\r\nfrom that State, and lawyers of eminence in it, prove that the courts of\r\nlaw in that State have been open and freely resorted to by the British\r\ncreditors, who have recovered and levied their moneys without obstruction;\r\nfor we have no right to consider as obstructions the dilatory pleas\r\nof here and there a debtor, distressed perhaps for time, or even an\r\naccidental error of opinion in a subordinate court, when such pleas have\r\nbeen overruled, and such errors corrected in a due course of proceeding\r\nmarked out by the laws in such cases. The general fact suffices to show\r\nthat the assertion under examination cannot be applied to this State.\r\n\r\nIn North Carolina, Mr. Johnston, one of the senators of that State, tells\r\nus he has heard indeed but of few suits brought by British creditors in\r\nthat State; but that he never heard that any one had failed of a recovery\r\nbecause he was a British subject; and he names a particular case, of\r\nElmesly _v._ Lee's executors, \"of the recovery of a British debt in the\r\nsuperior court at Edenton.\" See Mr. Johnston's letter, No. 54.\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, we learn, from No. 55, of particular judgments\r\nrendered, and prosecutions carried on, without obstacle, by British\r\ncreditors, and that the courts are open to them there as elsewhere. As to\r\nthe modifications of the execution heretofore made by the State law having\r\nbeen the same for foreigner and citizen, a court would decide whether the\r\ntreaty is satisfied by this equal measure; and if the British creditor is\r\nprivileged by that against even the same modifications to which citizens\r\nand foreigners of all other nations were equally subjected, then the law\r\nimposing them was a mere nullity.\r\n\r\nIn Georgia, the letter of the senators and representatives in Congress,\r\nNo. 56, assures us that, though they do not know of any recovery of\r\na British debt, in their State, neither do they know of a denial to\r\nrecover since the ratification of the treaty, the creditors having mostly\r\npreferred amicable settlement; and that the federal court is as open and\r\nunobstructed to British creditors there, as in any other of the United\r\nStates; and this is further proved by the late recovery of Brailsford and\r\nothers, before cited.\r\n\r\nSec. 48. You say more particularly of that State, page 25, \"It is to be\r\nlamented, that, in a more distant State, (Georgia) it was a received\r\nprinciple, inculcated by an opinion of the highest judicial authority\r\nthere, that as no Legislative act of the State ever existed, confirming\r\nthe treaty of peace with Great Britain, war still continued between\r\nthe two countries--_a principle which may perhaps still continue in\r\nthat State_.\" No judge, no case, no time, is named. Imputations on the\r\njudiciary of a country are too serious to be neglected. I have thought\r\nit my duty, therefore, to spare no endeavors to find on what fact this\r\ncensure was meant to be affixed. I have found that Judge Walton of\r\nGeorgia, in the summer of 1783, the definitive treaty not yet signed in\r\nEurope, much less known and ratified here, set aside a writ in the case\r\nof Thompson, (a British subject) _v._ Thompson, assigning for reasons,\r\n1st. \"That there was no law authorizing a subject of England to sue\r\na citizen of that State; 2d. That the war had not been _definitively_\r\nconcluded; or 3d. If concluded, the treaty not _known to, or ratified\r\nby_, the Legislature; nor 4th. Was it in any manner ascertained how those\r\ndebts were to be liquidated.\" With respect to the last reason, it was\r\ngenerally expected that some more specific arrangements, as to the manner\r\nof liquidating and times of paying British debts would have been settled\r\nin the definitive treaty. No. 58 shows, that such arrangements were under\r\ncontemplation. And the judge seems to have been of opinion that it was\r\nnecessary the treaty should be _definitively_ concluded, before it could\r\nbecome a law of the land, so as to change the legal character of an _alien\r\nenemy_, who cannot maintain an action, into that of an _alien friend_, who\r\nmay. Without entering into the question, whether, between the provisional\r\nand definitive treaties, a subject of either party could maintain\r\nan action in the courts of the other (a question of no consequence,\r\nconsidering how short the interval was, and this, probably the only action\r\nessayed), we must admit that, if the judge was right in his opinion, that\r\na _definitive_ conclusion was necessary, he was right in his consequence\r\nthat it should be _made known_ to the Legislature of the State, or, in\r\nother words, to the State; and that, till that _notification_, it was\r\nnot a law authorizing a subject of England to sue a citizen of that\r\nState. The subsequent doctrine of the same judge, Walton, with respect\r\nto the treaties, _when duly completed_, that they are paramount to the\r\nlaws of the several States, as has been seen in this charge to a grand\r\njury, before spoken of, (Sec. 43,) will relieve your doubts whether the\r\n\"principle still continues in that State, of the _continuance of war\r\nbetween the two countries_.\"\r\n\r\nSec. 49. The latter part of the quotation before made, merits notice also,\r\nto wit, where, after saying not a single instance exists of the recovery\r\nof a British debt, it is added, \"though many years have expired since the\r\nestablishment of peace between the two countries.\" It is evident from the\r\npreceding testimony, that many suits have been brought, and with effect;\r\nyet it has often been matter of surprise that more were not brought, and\r\nearlier, since it is most certain that the courts would have sustained\r\ntheir actions and given them judgments. This abstinence on the part of the\r\ncreditors has excited a suspicion that they wished rather to recur to the\r\ntreasury of their own country; and to have color for this, they would have\r\nit believed that there were obstructions here to bringing their suits.\r\nTheir testimony is in fact the sole, to which your court till now, has\r\ngiven access. Had the opportunity now presented been given us sooner, they\r\nshould sooner have known that the courts of the United States, whenever\r\nthe creditors would choose that recourse, and would press, if necessary,\r\nto the highest tribunals, would be found as open to their suits, and as\r\nimpartial to their subjects, as theirs to ours.\r\n\r\nSec. 50. There is an expression in your letter, page 7, that \"British\r\ncreditors have not been countenanced or supported, either by the\r\nrespective Legislatures, or by the State courts, in their endeavors to\r\nrecover the full value of debts contracted antecedently to the treaty\r\nof peace.\" And again, in p. 8, \"In many of the States, the subjects of\r\nthe crown in endeavoring to obtain the restitution of their forfeited\r\nestates and property, have been treated with indignity.\" From which an\r\ninference might be drawn, which I am sure you did not intend, to wit:\r\nthat the creditors have been deterred from resorting to the courts by\r\npopular tumults, and not protected by the laws of the country. I recollect\r\nto have heard of one or two attempts, by popular collections, to deter\r\nthe prosecution of British claims. One of these is mentioned in No. 49.\r\nBut these were immediately on the close of the war, while its passions\r\nhad not yet had time to subside, and while the ashes of our houses were\r\nstill smoking. Since that, say for many years past, nothing like popular\r\ninterposition, on this subject, has been heard of in any part of our\r\nland. There is no country, which is not sometimes subject to irregular\r\ninterpositions of the People. There is no country able, at all times, to\r\npunish them. There is no country which has less of this to reproach itself\r\nwith, than the United States, nor any, where the laws have more regular\r\ncourse, or are more habitually and cheerfully acquiesced in. Confident\r\nthat your own observation and information will have satisfied you of this\r\ntruth, I rely that the inference was not intended, which seems to result\r\nfrom these expressions.\r\n\r\nSec. 51. Some notice is to be taken, as to the great deficiencies in\r\ncollection urged on behalf of the British merchants. The course of our\r\ncommerce with Great Britain was ever for the merchant there to give his\r\ncorrespondent here a year's credit; so that we were regularly indebted\r\nfrom a year to a year and a half's amount of our exports. It is the\r\nopinion of judicious merchants, that it never exceeded the latter term,\r\nand that it did not exceed the former at the commencement of the war.\r\nLet the holders then of this debt be classed into, 1st. Those who were\r\ninsolvent at that time. 2d. Those solvent then, who became insolvent\r\nduring the operations of the war--a numerous class. 3d. Those solvent\r\nat the close of the war, but insolvent now. 4th. Those solvent at the\r\nclose of the war, who have since paid or settled satisfactorily with\r\ntheir creditors--a numerous class also. 5th. Those solvent then and now,\r\nwho have neither paid, nor made satisfactory arrangements with their\r\ncreditors. This last class, the only one now in question, is little\r\nnumerous, and the amount of their debts but a moderate proportion of the\r\naggregate which was due at the commencement of the war; insomuch, that it\r\nis the opinion, that we do not owe to Great Britain, at this moment, of\r\nseparate debts, old and new, more than a year, or a year and a quarter's\r\nexports, the ordinary amount of the debt resulting from the common course\r\nof dealings.\r\n\r\nSec. 52. In drawing a comparison between the proceedings of Great Britain\r\nand the United States, you say, page 35, \"The conduct of Great Britain,\r\nin all these respects, has been widely different from that which has\r\nbeen observed by the United States. In the courts of law of the former\r\ncountry, the citizens of the United States have experienced, _without\r\nexception_, the same protection and _impartial_ distribution of justice,\r\nas the subjects of the crown.\" No nation can answer for perfect exactitude\r\nof proceedings in all their inferior courts. It suffices to provide a\r\nsupreme judicature, where all error and partiality will be ultimately\r\ncorrected. With this qualification, we have heretofore been in the habit\r\nof considering the administration of justice in Great Britain as extremely\r\npure. With the same qualification, we have no fear to risk everything\r\nwhich a nation holds dear, on the assertion, that the administration of\r\njustice here will be found equally pure. When the citizens of either party\r\ncomplain of the judiciary proceedings of the other, they naturally present\r\nbut one side of the case to view, and are, therefore, to be listened to\r\nwith caution. Numerous condemnations have taken place in your courts of\r\nvessels taken from us after the expirations of the terms of one and two\r\nmonths stipulated in the armistice. The State of Maryland has been making\r\nineffectual efforts, for nine years, to recover a sum of £55,000 sterling,\r\nlodged in the bank of England previous to the war. A judge of the King's\r\nbench lately declared, in the case of Greene, an American citizen, _v._\r\nBuchanan and Charnock, British subjects, that a citizen of the United\r\nStates, who had delivered £43,000 sterling worth of East India goods to\r\na British subject at Ostend, receiving only £18,000 in part payment, is\r\nnot entitled to maintain an action for the balance in a court of Great\r\nBritain, though his debtor is found there, is in custody of the court,\r\nand acknowledges the fact. These cases appear strong to us. If your\r\njudges have done wrong in them, we expect redress. If right, we expect\r\nexplanations. Some of them have already been laid before your court. The\r\nothers will be so in due time. These, and such as these, are the smaller\r\nmatters between the two nations, which, in my letter of December 15th, I\r\nhad the honor to intimate, that it would be better to refer for settlement\r\nthrough the ordinary channel of our ministers, than embarrass the present\r\nimportant discussions with them. Such cases will be constantly produced\r\nby a collision of interests in the dealings of individuals, and will be\r\neasily adjusted by a readiness to do right on both sides, regardless of\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nSec. 53. III. It is made an objection to the proceedings of our\r\nlegislative and judiciary bodies, that they have refused to allow interest\r\nto run on debts during the course of the war. The decision of the right\r\nto this rests with the judiciary alone, neither the Legislative nor the\r\nExecutive having any authority to intermeddle.\r\n\r\nThe administration of justice is a branch of the sovereignty over a\r\ncountry, and belongs exclusively to the nation inhabiting it. No foreign\r\npower can pretend to participate in their jurisdiction, or that their\r\ncitizens received there are not subject to it. When a cause has been\r\nadjudged according to the rules and forms of the country, its justice\r\nought to be presumed. Even error in the highest court which has been\r\nprovided as the last means of correcting the errors of others, and whose\r\ndecrees are, therefore, subject to no further revisal, is one of those\r\ninconveniences flowing from the imperfection of our faculties, to which\r\nevery society must submit; because there must be somewhere a last resort,\r\nwherein contestations may end. Multiply bodies of revisal as you please,\r\ntheir number must still be finite, and they must finish in the hands\r\nof fallible men as judges. If the error be evident, palpable, [16]et\r\nin re minime dubiâ, it then, indeed, assumes another form; it excites\r\npresumption that it was not mere error, but premeditated wrong; and the\r\nforeigner, as well as native, suffering by the wrong, may reasonably\r\ncomplain, as for a wrong committed in any other way. In such case, there\r\nbeing no redress in the ordinary forms of the country, a foreign prince\r\nmay listen to complaint from his subjects injured by the adjudication, may\r\ninquire into its principles to prove their criminality, and, according to\r\nthe magnitude of the wrong, take his measures of redress by reprisal, or\r\nby a refusal of right on his part. If the denial of interest, in our case,\r\nbe justified by law, or even if it be against law, but not in that gross,\r\nevident, and palpable degree, which proves it to flow from the wickedness\r\nof the heart, and not error of the head in the judges, then is it no cause\r\nfor just complaint, much less for a refusal of right, or self-redress in\r\nany other way. The reasons on which the denial of interest is grounded\r\nshall be stated summarily, yet sufficiently to justify the integrity of\r\nthe judge, and even to produce a presumption that they might be extended\r\nto that of his science also, were that material to the present object.\r\n\r\nSec. 54. The treaty is the text of the law in the present case, and its\r\nwords are, that there shall be no lawful impediment to the recovery of\r\nbona fide _debts_. Nothing is said of _interest_ on these debts; and the\r\nsole question is, whether, where a _debt_ is given, _interest_ thereon\r\nflows from the general principles of the law? Interest is not a part\r\nof the debt, but something added to the debt by way of damage for the\r\ndetention of it. This is the definition of the English lawyers themselves,\r\nwho say, \"Interest is recovered by way of _damages_ ratione detentionis\r\ndebiti.\"[17] 2 Salk. 622, 623. Formerly, all interest was considered as\r\nunlawful, in every country of Europe; it is still so in Roman Catholic\r\ncountries, and countries little commercial. From this, as a general rule,\r\na few special cases are excepted. In France, particularly, the exceptions\r\nare those of minors, marriage portions, and money, the price of lands.\r\nSo thoroughly do their laws condemn the allowance of interest, that a\r\nparty who has paid it voluntarily, may recover it back again whenever he\r\npleases. Yet this has never been taken up as a gross and flagrant denial\r\nof justice, authorizing national complaint against those governments.\r\nIn England, also, all interest was against law, till the stat. 37 H.\r\n8, c. 9. The growing spirit of commerce, no longer restrained by the\r\nprinciples of the Roman church, then first began to tolerate it. The same\r\ncauses produced the same effect in Holland, and, perhaps, in some other\r\ncommercial and Catholic countries. But, even in England, the allowance\r\nof interest is not given by _express law_, but rests on the _discretion\r\nof judges and juries_, as the arbiters of damages. Sometimes the judge\r\nhas enlarged the interest to 20 per cent. per annum. [1 Chanc. Rep. 57.]\r\nIn other cases, he fixes it, habitually, one per cent. lower than the\r\nlegal rate, [2 T. Atk. 343,] and in a multitude of cases he refuses it\r\naltogether. As, for instance, no interest is allowed--\r\n\r\n1. On arrears of rents, profits, or annuities. 1 Chan. Rep. 184, 2 P. W.\r\n163.

Eq. 530, 7.\r\n\r\nAnd we may add, once for all, that there is no instrument or title to\r\ndebt, so formal and sacred, as to give a right to interest on it, under\r\nall possible circumstances--the words of Lord Mansfield, Dougl. 753, where\r\nhe says: \"That the question was, what was to be the rule for assessing\r\nthe _damage_, and that, in this case, the _interest_ ought to be the\r\n_measure of the damage_, the action being for a _debt_, but that, in a\r\ncase of another sort, _the rule might be different_:\" his words, Dougl.\r\n376, \"That interest might be payable in cases of delay, if a jury, _in\r\ntheir discretion_, shall think fit to allow it.\" And the doctrine in Giles\r\nv. Hart. 2 Salk. 622, that damages, or interest, are but an accessary to\r\nthe debt, which may be barred by circumstances, which do not touch the\r\ndebt itself, suffice to prove that interest is not a part of the debt,\r\nneither comprehended in the thing, nor in the term; that words, which pass\r\nthe debt, do not give interest necessarily; that the interest _depends\r\naltogether on the discretion of the judges and jurors_, who will govern\r\nthemselves by all existing circumstances, will take the legal interest\r\nfor the measure of their damages, or more or less, as they think right;\r\nwill give it from the date of the contract, or from a year after, or deny\r\nit altogether, according as the fault or the sufferings of the one or\r\nthe other party shall dictate. Our laws are, generally, an adoption of\r\nyours, and I do not know that any of the States have changed them in this\r\nparticular. But there is one rule of your and our law, which, while it\r\nproves that every title of debt is liable to a disallowance of interest\r\nunder special circumstances, is so applicable to our case, that I shall\r\ncite it as a text, and apply it to the circumstances of our case. It is\r\nlaid down in Vin. Abr. Interest. c. 7, and 2 Abr. Eq. 5293, and elsewhere,\r\nin these words: \"Where, by a _general and national calamity_, nothing is\r\nmade out of lands which are assigned for payment of interest, it ought not\r\nto run on _during the time of such calamity_.\" This is exactly the case in\r\nquestion. Can a more _general national calamity_ be conceived, than that\r\nuniversal devastation which took place in many of these States during war?\r\nWas it ever more exactly the case anywhere, _that nothing was made out of\r\nthe lands which were to pay the interest_? The produce of those lands, for\r\nwant of the opportunity of exporting it safely, was down to almost nothing\r\nin real money, e. g. tobacco was less than a dollar the hundred weight.\r\nImported articles of clothing for consumption were from four to eight\r\ntimes their usual price. A bushel of salt was usually sold for 100 lbs.\r\nof tobacco. At the same time, these lands, and other property, in which\r\nthe money of the British creditor was vested, were paying high taxes for\r\ntheir own protection, and the debtor, as nominal holder, stood ultimate\r\ninsurer of their value to the creditor, who was the real proprietor,\r\nbecause they were bought with his money. And who will estimate the value\r\nof this insurance, or say what would have been the forfeit, in a contrary\r\nevent of the war? Who will say that the risk of the property was not worth\r\nthe interest of its price? _General calamity_, then, prevented profit and,\r\nconsequently, stopped interest, which is in lieu of profit. The creditor\r\nsays, indeed, he has laid out of his money; he has therefore lost the\r\nuse of it. The debtor replies, that, if the creditor has lost, he has\r\nnot gained it; that this may be a question between two parties, both of\r\nwhom have lost. In that case, the courts will not double the loss of the\r\none, to save all loss from the other. That it is a rule of natural as\r\nwell as municipal law, that in questions \"de damno evitando melior est\r\nconditio possidentis.\" If this maxim be just, where each party is equally\r\ninnocent, how much more so, where the loss has been produced by the act\r\nof the creditor? For, a nation, as a society, forms a moral person, and\r\nevery member of it is personally responsible for his society. It was the\r\nact of the lender, or of his nation, which annihilated the profits of the\r\nmoney lent; he cannot then demand profits which he either prevented from\r\ncoming into existence, or burnt, or otherwise destroyed, after they were\r\nproduced. If, then, there be no instrument, or title of debt so formal\r\nand sacred as to give right to interest under all possible circumstances,\r\nand if circumstances of exemption, stronger than in the present case,\r\ncannot possibly be found, then no instrument or title of debt, however\r\nformal or sacred, can give right to interest under the circumstances\r\nof our case. Let us present the question in another point of view. Your\r\nown law forbade the payment of interest, when it forbade the receipt of\r\nAmerican produce into Great Britain, and made that produce fair prize on\r\nits way from the debtor to the creditor, or to any other, for his use of\r\nreimbursement. All personal access between creditor and debtor was made\r\nillegal; and the debtor, who endeavored to make a remitment of his debt,\r\nor interest, must have done it three times, to answer its getting once to\r\nhand; for two out of three vessels were generally taken by the creditor\r\nnation, and, sometimes, by the creditor himself, as many of them turned\r\ntheir trading vessels into privateers. Where no place has been agreed\r\non for the payment of a debt, the laws of England oblige the debtor to\r\nseek his creditor wheresoever he is to be found _within the realm_--Coke\r\nLit. 210, b. but do not bind him to go out of the realm in search of him.\r\nThis is our law too. The first act, generally, of the creditors and their\r\nagents here, was, to withdraw from the United States with their books and\r\npapers. The creditor thus withdrawing from his debtor, so as to render\r\npayment impossible, either of the principal or interest, makes it like\r\nthe common case of a tender and refusal of money, after which, interest\r\nstops, both by your laws and ours. We see, too, from the letter of Mr.\r\nAdams, June 16, 1786, No. 57, that the British Secretary for Foreign\r\nAffairs was sensible that a British statute, having rendered criminal\r\nall intercourse between the debtor and creditor, had placed the article\r\nof interest on a different footing from the principal. And the letter of\r\nour plenipotentiaries to Mr. Hartley, the British plenipotentiary, for\r\nforming the definitive treaty, No. 58, shows, that the omission to express\r\n_interest_ in the treaty, was not merely an oversight of the parties;\r\nthat its allowance was considered by our plenipotentiaries as a thing not\r\nto be intended in the treaty, was declared against by Congress, and that\r\ndeclaration communicated to Mr. Hartley. After such an explanation, the\r\nomission is a proof of acquiescence, and an intention not to claim it. It\r\nappears, then, that the _debt_ and _interest_ on that debt are separate\r\nthings in every country, and under separate rules. That, in every country,\r\na _debt_ is recoverable, while, in most countries, interest is refused\r\nin all cases; in others, given or refused, diminished or augmented, at\r\nthe discretion of the judge; nowhere given in all cases indiscriminately,\r\nand consequently nowhere so incorporated with the _debt_ as to pass with\r\nthat, _ex vi termini_, or otherwise to be considered as a determinate and\r\n_vestat_ thing.\r\n\r\nWhile the taking _interest on money_ has thus been considered, in some\r\ncountries, as morally wrong in all cases, in others made legally right\r\nbut in particular cases, the taking _profits from lands_, or rents in\r\nlieu of profits, has been allowed everywhere, and at all times, both in\r\nmorality and law. Hence it is laid down as a general rule, Wolf, s. 229,\r\n\"Si quis fundum alienum possidet, domini est quantum valet usas fundi,\r\net possessoris quantum valet ejus cultura et cura.\"[18] But even in the\r\ncase of lands restored by a treaty, the _arrears_ of profits or rents are\r\nnever restored, unless they be particularly stipulated. \"Si res vi pacis\r\nrestituendæ, restituendi quoque sunt fructus a die _concessionis_,\"[19]\r\nsay Wolf, s. 1224; and Grotius, \"cui pace res conceditur, ei et fructus\r\nconceduntur à _tempore concessionis_: NON RETRO.\"[20] l. 3. c. 20. s.\r\n22. To place the right to interest on money on a level with the right to\r\nprofits on land, is placing it more advantageously than has been hitherto\r\nauthorized; and if, as we have seen, a stipulation to restore lands does\r\nnot include a stipulation to restore the _back profits_, we may certainly\r\nconclude, _à fortiori_, that the restitution of debts does not include an\r\nallowance of _back interest_ on them.\r\n\r\nThese reasons, and others like these, have probably operated on the\r\ndifferent courts to produce decisions, that \"no interest should run\r\nduring the time this general and national calamity lasted;\" and they seem\r\nsufficient at least to rescue their decisions from that flagrant denial\r\nof right, which can alone authorize one nation to come forward with\r\ncomplaints against the judiciary proceedings of another.\r\n\r\nSec. 55. The States have been uniform in the allowance of interest before\r\nand since the war, but not of that claimed during the war. Thus we know by\r\n[E. 1.] the case of Neate's executors _v._ Sands, in New York, and Mildred\r\n_v._ Dorsey, in Maryland, that in those States interest during the war\r\nis disallowed by the courts. By [D. 8.] 1784, May, the act relating to\r\ndebts due to persons who have been, and remained within the enemy's power\r\nor lines during the late war. That Connecticut left it to their Court of\r\nChancery to determine the matter according to the rules of equity, or\r\nto leave it to referees; by [E. 2.] the case of Osborn _v._ Mifflin's\r\nexecutors, and [E. 3.] Hare _v._ Allen, explained in the letter of Mr.\r\nRawle, attorney of the United States, No. 59. And by the letter of Mr.\r\nLewis, judge of the district court of the United States, No. 60, that in\r\nPennsylvania the rule is, that where neither the creditor nor any agent\r\nwas within the State, no interest was allowed; where either remained, they\r\ngave interest. In all the other States, I believe it is left discretionary\r\nin the courts and juries. In Massachusetts the practice has varied. In\r\nNovember, 1784, they instruct their Delegates in Congress to ask the\r\ndetermination of Congress, whether they understood the word \"debts\" in\r\nthe treaty as including interest? and whether it is their opinion, that\r\ninterest during the war should be paid? and at the same time they pass\r\n[D. 9.] the act directing the courts to suspend rendering judgment for any\r\ninterest that might have accrued between April 19, 1775, and January 20,\r\n1783. But in 1787, when there was a general compliance enacted through\r\nall the United States, in order to see if that would produce a counter\r\ncompliance, their Legislature passed the act repealing all laws repugnant\r\nto the treaty, No. 33, and their courts, on their part, changed their rule\r\nrelative to interest during the war, which they have uniformly allowed\r\nsince that time. The Circuit Court of the United States, at their sessions\r\nat ----, in 1790, determined in like manner that interest should be\r\nallowed during the war. So that, on the whole, we see that, in one State\r\ninterest during the war is given in every case; in another it is given\r\nwherever the creditor, or any agent for him, remained in the country, so\r\nas to be accessible; in the others, it is left to the courts and juries\r\nto decide according to their discretion and the circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RECAPITULATE.\r\n\r\nSec. 56. I have, by way of preliminary, placed out of the present\r\ndiscussion all acts and proceedings prior to the treaty of peace,\r\nconsidering them as settled by that instrument, and that the then state\r\nof things was adopted by the parties, with such alterations only as that\r\ninstrument provided.\r\n\r\nI have then taken up the subsequent acts and proceedings, of which you\r\ncomplain as infractions, distributing them according to their subjects,\r\nto wit:\r\n\r\n  I. Exile and confiscations.\r\n  II. Debts.\r\n  III. Interest.\r\n\r\n  I. Exile and confiscations.\r\n\r\nAfter premising, that these are lawful acts of war, I have shown that\r\nthe 5th article was _recommendatory_ only, its stipulations being, not to\r\n_restore_ the confiscations and exiles, but to _recommend_ to the State\r\nLegislatures to restore them:\r\n\r\nThat this word, having but one meaning, establishes the intent of the\r\nparties; and moreover, that it was particularly explained by the American\r\nnegotiators, that the Legislatures would be free to comply with the\r\nrecommendation or not, and probably would not comply:\r\n\r\nThat the British _negotiators_ so understood it:\r\n\r\nThat the British _ministry_ so understood it:\r\n\r\nAnd the members of both Houses of _Parliament_, as well those who\r\napproved, as who disapproved the article.\r\n\r\nI have shown, that Congress did recommend, earnestly and _bona fide_:\r\n\r\nThat the States refused or complied, in a greater or less degree,\r\naccording to circumstances, but more of them, and in a greater degree than\r\nwas expected:\r\n\r\nAnd that compensation, by the British treasury, to British sufferers,\r\nwas the alternative of her own choice, our negotiators having offered to\r\ndo that, if she would compensate such losses as we had sustained by acts\r\nauthorized by the modern and moderate principles of war.\r\n\r\n  II. Before entering on the subject of debts, it was necessary--\r\n\r\n1st. To review the British infractions, and refer them to their exact\r\ndates.\r\n\r\nTo show that the carrying away of the negroes preceded the 6th of May,\r\n1783.\r\n\r\nThat instead of evacuating the _upper posts with all convenient speed_,\r\nno order had been received for the evacuation, August 13, 1783.\r\n\r\nNone had been received May 10, 1784.\r\n\r\nNone had been received July 13, 1784.\r\n\r\nFrom whence I conclude none had ever been _given_,\r\n\r\nAnd thence, that none had ever been _intended_.\r\n\r\nIn the latter case, this infraction would date from the signature of\r\nthe treaty. But founding it on the _not giving the order with convenient\r\nspeed_, it dates from April, 1783, when the order for evacuating New York\r\nwas given, as there can be no reason why it should have been inconvenient\r\nto give this order as early.\r\n\r\nThe infraction, then, respecting the upper posts, was before the treaty\r\nwas known in America.\r\n\r\nThat respecting the negroes, was as soon as it was known.\r\n\r\nI have observed that these infractions were highly injurious.\r\n\r\nThe first, by depriving us of our fur trade, profitable in itself, and\r\nvaluable as a means of remittance for paying the debts; by intercepting\r\nour friendly and neighborly intercourse with the Indian nations, and\r\nconsequently keeping us in constant, expensive, and barbarous war with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe second, by withdrawing the cultivators of the soil, the produce of\r\nwhich was to pay the debts.\r\n\r\n2d. After fixing the date of the British infractions, I have shown,\r\n\r\nThat, as they _preceded_, so they _produced_ the acts on our part\r\ncomplained of, as obstacles to the recovery of the debts.\r\n\r\nThat when one party breaks any stipulation of a treaty, the other is free\r\nto break it also, either in the whole, or in equivalent parts, at its\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nThat Congress having made no elections,\r\n\r\nFour of the States assumed, separately, to modify the recovery of debts--\r\n\r\n1. By indulging their citizens with longer and more practicable times of\r\npayment.\r\n\r\n2. By liberating their bodies from execution, on their delivering property\r\nto the creditor, to the full amount of his demand, on a fair appraisement,\r\nas practised always under the elegit.\r\n\r\n3. By admitting, during the first moments of the non-existence of coin\r\namong us, a discharge of executions by payment in paper money.\r\n\r\nThe first of these acts of retaliation, was in December, 1783, nine months\r\nafter the infractions committed by the other party.\r\n\r\nAnd all of them were so moderate, of so short duration, the result of\r\nsuch necessities, and so produced, that we might, with confidence, have\r\nreferred them, _alterius principis, quo boni viri, arbitrio_.\r\n\r\n3. That induced, at length, by assurances from the British court, that\r\nthey would concur in a fulfilment of the treaty,\r\n\r\nCongress, in 1787, declared to the States its will, that even the\r\nappearance of obstacle, raised by their acts, should no longer continue;\r\n\r\nAnd required a formal repeal of every act of that nature; and to avoid\r\nquestion, required it as well from those who had not, as from those who\r\nhad passed such acts; which was complied with so fully, that no such laws\r\nremained in any State of the Union, except one;\r\n\r\nAnd even that one could not have forborne, if any symptoms of compliance\r\nfrom the opposite party had rendered a reiterated requisition from\r\nCongress important.\r\n\r\n4. That, indeed, the requiring such a repeal, was only to take away\r\npretext:\r\n\r\nFor, that it was at all times perfectly understood, that treaties\r\ncontrolled the laws of the States--\r\n\r\nThe confederation having made them obligatory on the whole:\r\n\r\nCongress having so declared and demonstrated them:\r\n\r\nThe Legislatures and Executives of most of the States having admitted it:\r\n\r\nAnd the Judiciaries, both of the separate and General Governments, so\r\ndeciding.\r\n\r\nThat the courts are open everywhere upon this principle:\r\n\r\nThat the British creditors have, for some time, been in the habit and\r\ncourse of recovering their debts at law:\r\n\r\nThat the class of separate and unsettled debts contracted before the war,\r\nforms now but a small proportion of the original amount:\r\n\r\nThat the integrity and independence of the courts of justice in the United\r\nStates, are liable to no reproach:\r\n\r\nNor have popular tumults furnished any ground for suggesting, that either\r\ncourts or creditors are overawed by them in their proceedings.\r\n\r\n  III. Proceeding to the article of interest, I have observed:\r\n\r\nThat the decision, whether it shall or shall not be allowed _during the\r\nwar_, rests, by our constitution, with the courts altogether.\r\n\r\nThat if these have generally decided against the allowance, the reasons\r\nof their decisions appear so weighty, as to clear them from the charge of\r\nthat palpable degree of wrong, which may authorize national complaint, or\r\ngive a right of refusing execution of the treaty, by way of reprisal.\r\n\r\nTo vindicate them, I have stated shortly, some of the reasons which\r\nsupport their opinion.\r\n\r\nThat interest during the war, was not _expressly_ given by the treaty:\r\n\r\nThat the revival of debts did not, _ex vi termini_, give interest on them:\r\n\r\nThat interest is not a part of the debt, but damages for the detention of\r\nthe debt:\r\n\r\nThat it is disallowed habitually in most countries;\r\n\r\nYet has never been deemed a ground of national complaint against them:\r\n\r\nThat in England also, it was formerly unlawful in all cases:\r\n\r\nThat at this day it is denied there, in such a variety of instances, as\r\nto protect from it a great part of the transactions of life:\r\n\r\nThat, in fact, there is not a single _title_ to debt, so formal\r\nand sacred, as to give a right to _interest_, under all possible\r\ncircumstances, either there or here:\r\n\r\nThat of these circumstances, judges and jurors are to decide, _in their\r\ndiscretion_, and are accordingly in the habit of augmenting, diminishing,\r\nor refusing interest, in every case, according to their discretion:\r\n\r\nThat the circumstances against the allowance, are unquestionably of the\r\nstrongest in our case:\r\n\r\nThat a _great national calamity_ rendering the lands unproductive, which\r\nwere to pay the interest, has been adjudged a sufficient cause of itself,\r\nto suspend interest:\r\n\r\nThat, were both plaintiff and defendant equally innocent of that cause,\r\n\r\nThe question, who should avoid loss? would be in favor of the party in\r\npossession:\r\n\r\nAnd, _à fortiori_, in his favor, where the calamity was produced by the\r\nact of the demandant.\r\n\r\nThat, moreover, the laws of the party creditor had cut off the _personal_\r\naccess of his debtor,\r\n\r\nAnd the transportation of his _produce or money_ to the country of the\r\ncreditor, or to any other for him:\r\n\r\nAnd where the creditor prevents payment both of principal and interest,\r\nthe latter, at least, is justly extinguished.\r\n\r\nThat the _departure_ of the creditor, leaving no agent in the country of\r\nthe debtor, would have stopped interest of itself,\r\n\r\nThe debtor not being obliged to go out of the country to seek him.\r\n\r\nThat the British minister was heretofore sensible of the weight of the\r\nobjections to the claim of interest:\r\n\r\nThat the declarations of Congress and our plenipotentiaries, _previous to\r\nthe definitive treaty_, and the silence of that instrument, afford proof\r\nthat interest was not intended on our part, nor insisted on, on the other:\r\n\r\nThat, were we to admit interest on money, to equal favor with profits on\r\nland, arrears of profits would not be demandable in the present case, nor\r\nconsequently arrears of interest:\r\n\r\nAnd, on the whole, without undertaking to say what the law is, which is\r\nnot the province of the Executive,\r\n\r\nWe say, that the reasons of those judges, who deny interest during the\r\nwar, _appear sufficiently cogent_--\r\n\r\nTo account for their opinion on honest principles:\r\n\r\nTo exempt it from the charge of palpable and flagrant wrong, _in re minime\r\ndubiâ_:\r\n\r\nAnd to take away all pretence of withholding execution of the treaty, by\r\nway of reprisal for that cause.\r\n\r\nSec. 57. I have now, sir, gone through the several acts and proceedings\r\nenumerated in your appendix, as infractions of the treaty, omitting, I\r\nbelieve, not a single one, as may be seen by a table hereto subjoined,\r\nwherein every one of them, as marked and numbered in your appendix, is\r\nreferred to the section of this letter in which it is brought into view;\r\nand the result has been, as you have seen--\r\n\r\n1. That there was no absolute stipulation to restore _antecedent_\r\nconfiscations, and that none _subsequent_ took place:\r\n\r\n2. That the recovery of the debts was obstructed _validly_ in none of\r\nour States, _invalidly_ only in a few, and that not till long after the\r\ninfractions committed on the other side; and\r\n\r\n3. That the decisions of courts and juries against the claims of interest\r\nare too probably founded to give cause for questioning their integrity.\r\nThese things being evident, I cannot but flatter myself, after the\r\nassurances received from you of his Britannic Majesty's desire to remove\r\nevery occasion of misunderstanding from between us, that an end will now\r\nbe put to the disquieting situation of the two countries, by as complete\r\nexecution of the treaty as circumstances render practicable at this late\r\nday: that it is to be done so late has been the source of heavy losses,\r\nof blood and treasure, to the United States. Still our desire of friendly\r\naccommodation is, and has been, constant. No \"_lawful impediment_ has\r\nbeen opposed to the prosecution of the just rights of your citizens.\"\r\nAnd if any instances of _unlawful_ impediment have existed in any of\r\nthe inferior tribunals, they would, like other unlawful proceedings,\r\nhave been overruled on appeal to the higher courts. If not overruled\r\nthere, a complaint to the Government would have been regular, and their\r\ninterference probably effectual. If your citizens would not prosecute\r\ntheir rights, it was impossible they should recover them, or be denied\r\nrecovery; and till a denial of right through all the tribunals, there is\r\nno ground for complaint; much less for a refusal to comply with solemn\r\nstipulations, the execution of which is too important to us ever to\r\nbe dispensed with. These difficulties being removed from between the\r\ntwo nations, I am persuaded the interests of both will be found in the\r\nstrictest friendship. The considerations which lead to it are too numerous\r\nand forcible to fail of their effect; and that they may be permitted to\r\nhave their full effect, no one wishes more sincerely than he, who has the\r\nhonor to be, &c.[21]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n     [6] \"The state in which things are found at the moment of the treaty,\r\n     should be considered as lawful; and if it is meant to make any change\r\n     init, the treaty must expressly mention it.

One of\r\nthese, chapter twenty-four, will require your particular attention, as it\r\ncontains such regulations relative to the consular office, as it has been\r\nthought proper to establish legislatively.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the security required by the sixth section, I would prefer\r\npersons residing within the United States, where the party can procure\r\nsuch to be his security. In this case, his own bond duly executed may be\r\nsent to me, and his sureties here may enter into a separate bond. Where\r\nthe party cannot conveniently find sureties within the United States,\r\nmy distance and want of means of knowing their sufficiency, oblige\r\nme to refer him to the minister or chargé des affaires of the United\r\nStates, within the same government, if there be one, and if not, then\r\nto the minister of the United States, resident at Paris. The securities\r\nwhich they shall approve, will be admitted as good. In like manner, the\r\naccount for their disbursements, authorized by this law (and no other\r\ncan be allowed), are to be settled at stated periods with the minister\r\nor chargé within their residence, if there be one, if none, then with\r\nthe minister of the United States at Paris. The person who settles the\r\naccount is authorized to pay it. Our consuls in America are not meant to\r\nbe included in these directions as to securityship and the settlement\r\nof their accounts, as their situation gives them a more convenient\r\ncommunication with me. It is also recommended to the consuls to keep an\r\nordinary correspondence with the minister or chargé to whom they are thus\r\nreferred; but it would be also useful, if they could forward directly to\r\nme, from time to time, the prices current of their place, and any other\r\ncircumstance which it might be interesting to make known to our merchants\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\nThe prices of our funds have undergone some variations within the last\r\nthree months. The six per cents were pushed by gambling adventurers up to\r\ntwenty-six and a half, or twenty-seven and a half shillings the pound. A\r\nbankruptcy having taken place among these, and considerably affected the\r\nmore respectable part of the paper holders, a greater quantity of paper\r\nwas thrown suddenly on the market than there was demand or money to take\r\nup. The prices fell to nineteen shillings. This crisis has passed, and\r\nthey are getting up towards their value. Though the price of public paper\r\nis considered as the barometer of the public credit, it is truly so only\r\nas to the general average of prices. The real credit of the United States\r\ndepends on their ability, and the immutability of their will to pay their\r\ndebts. These were as evident when their paper fell to nineteen shillings,\r\nas when it was at twenty-seven shillings. The momentary variation was\r\nlike that in the price of corn, or any other commodity, the result of a\r\nmomentary disproportion between the demand and supply.\r\n\r\nThe unsuccessful issue of our expedition against the savages the last\r\nyear, is not unknown to you. More adequate preparations are making for\r\nthe present year, and in the meantime, some of the tribes have accepted\r\npeace, and others have expressed a readiness to do the same.\r\n\r\nAnother plentiful year has been added to those which had preceded it, and\r\nthe present bids fair to be equally so. A prosperity built on the basis of\r\nagriculture is that which is most desirable to us, because to the efforts\r\nof labor it adds the efforts of a greater proportion of soil. The checks,\r\nhowever, which the commercial regulations of Europe have given to the\r\nsale of our produce, have produced a very considerable degree of domestic\r\nmanufacture, which, so far as it is of the household kind, will doubtless\r\ncontinue, and so far as it is more public, will depend on the continuance\r\nor discontinuance of the European policy.\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN PAUL JONES.\r\n\r\n                                                Philadelphia, June 1, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--The President of the United States having thought proper to appoint\r\nyou commissioner for treating with the Dey and government of Algiers,\r\non the subjects of peace and ransom of our captives, I have the honor\r\nto enclose you the commission, of which Mr. Thomas Pinckney, now on his\r\nway to London as our Minister Plenipotentiary there, will be the bearer.\r\nSupposing that there exists a disposition to thwart our negotiations with\r\nthe Algerines, and that this would be very practicable, we have thought\r\nit advisable that the knowledge of this appointment should rest with the\r\nPresident, Mr. Pinckney and myself; for which reason you will perceive,\r\nthat the commissions are all in my own hand writing. For the same reason,\r\nentire secrecy is recommended to you, and that you so cover from the\r\npublic your departure and destination, as that they may not be conjectured\r\nor noticed; and at the same time, that you set out after as short delay\r\nas your affairs will possibly permit.\r\n\r\nIn order to enable you to enter on this business with full information,\r\nit will be necessary to give you a history of what has passed.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of July, 1785, the schooner Maria, Captain Stevens, belonging\r\nto a Mr. Foster, of Boston, was taken off Cape St. Vincents, by an\r\nAlgerine cruiser; and five days afterwards, the ship Dauphin, Captain\r\nO'Bryan, belonging to Messrs. Irwins, of Philadelphia, was taken by\r\nanother, about fifty leagues westward of Lisbon. These vessels, with\r\ntheir cargoes and crews, twenty-one persons in number, were carried into\r\nAlgiers. Mr. John Lambe, appointed agent for treating of peace between\r\nthe United States and the government of Algiers, was ready to set out\r\nfrom France on that business, when Mr. Adams and myself heard of these\r\ntwo captures. The ransom of prisoners being a case not existing when\r\nour powers were prepared, no provision had been made for it. We thought,\r\nhowever, we ought to endeavor to ransom our countrymen, without waiting\r\nfor orders; but at the same time, that acting without authority, we\r\nshould keep within the lowest price which had been given by any other\r\nnation. We therefore gave a supplementary instruction to Mr. Lambe to\r\nransom our captives, if it could be done for two hundred dollars a man,\r\nas we knew that three hundred French captives had been just ransomed by\r\nthe Mathurins, at a price very little above this sum. He proceeded to\r\nAlgiers; but his mission proved fruitless. He wrote us word from thence,\r\nthat the Dey asked fifty-nine thousand four hundred and ninety-six dollars\r\nfor the twenty-one captives, and that it was not probable he would abate\r\nmuch from that price. But he never intimated an idea of agreeing to\r\ngive it. As he has never settled the accounts of his mission, no further\r\ninformation has been received. It has been said that he entered into a\r\npositive stipulation with the Dey, to pay for the prisoners the price\r\nabove mentioned, or something near it; and that he came away with an\r\nassurance to return with the money. We cannot believe the fact true; and\r\nif it were, we disavow it totally, as far beyond his powers. We have never\r\ndisavowed it formally, because it has never come to our knowledge with\r\nany degree of certainty.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1787, I wrote to Congress to ask leave to employ the\r\nMathurins of France in ransoming our captives; and on the 19th of\r\nSeptember, I received their orders to do so, and to call for the money\r\nfrom our bankers at Amsterdam, as soon as it could be furnished. It was\r\nlong before they could furnish the money, and as soon as they notified\r\nthat they could, the business was put into train by the General of the\r\nMathurins, not with the appearance of acting for the United States,\r\nor with their knowledge, but merely on the usual ground of charity.\r\nThis expedient was rendered abortive by the revolution of France, the\r\nderangement of ecclesiastical orders there and the revocation of church\r\nproperty, before any proposition, perhaps, had been made in form by the\r\nMathurins to the Dey of Algiers. I have some reason to believe that Mr.\r\nEustace, while in Spain, endeavored to engage the court of Spain to employ\r\ntheir Mathurins in this business; but whether they actually moved in it\r\nor not, I have never learned.\r\n\r\nWe have also been told, that a Mr. Simpson of Gibraltar, by the direction\r\nof the Messrs. Bulkeleys of Lisbon, contracted for the ransom of our\r\nprisoners (then reduced by death and ransom to fourteen) at thirty-four\r\nthousand seven hundred and ninety-two dollars. By whose orders they did\r\nit, we could never learn. I have suspected it was some association in\r\nLondon, which, finding the prices far above their conception, did not go\r\nthrough with their purpose, which probably had been merely a philanthropic\r\none. Be this as it may, it was without our authority or knowledge.\r\n\r\nAgain, Mr. Cathalan, our consul at Marseilles, without any instruction\r\nfrom the government, and actuated merely, as we presume, by willingness\r\nto do something agreeable, set on foot another negotiation for their\r\nredemption; which ended in nothing.\r\n\r\nThese several volunteer interferences, though undertaken with good\r\nintentions, run directly counter to our plan; which was, to avoid the\r\nappearance of any purpose on our part ever to ransom our captives, and\r\nby that semblance of neglect, to reduce the demands of the Algerines to\r\nsuch a price, as might make it hereafter less their interest to pursue\r\nour citizens than any others. On the contrary, they have supposed all\r\nthese propositions directly or indirectly came from us; they inferred from\r\nthence the greatest anxiety on our part, where we had been endeavoring to\r\nmake them suppose there was none; kept up their demands for our captives\r\nat the highest prices ever paid by any nation; and thus these charitable,\r\nthough unauthorized interpositions, have had the double effect of\r\nstrengthening the chains they were meant to break, and making us at last\r\nset a much higher rate of ransom for our citizens, present and future,\r\nthan we probably should have obtained, if we had been left alone to do\r\nour own work in our own way. Thus stands this business then at present.\r\nA formal bargain, as I am informed, being registered in the books of the\r\nformer Dey, on the part of the Bulkeleys of Lisbon, which they suppose\r\nto be obligatory on us, but which is to be utterly disavowed, as having\r\nnever been authorized by us, nor its source even known to us.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, this subject was laid before Congress fully, and at the late\r\nsession, moneys have been provided, and authority given to proceed to the\r\nransom of our captive citizens at Algiers, provided it shall not exceed\r\na given sum, and provided also, a peace shall be previously negotiated\r\nwithin certain limits of expense. And in consequence of these proceedings,\r\nyour mission has been decided on by the President.\r\n\r\nSince, then, no _ransom_ is to take place without a _peace_, you will of\r\ncourse take up first the negotiation of peace; or, if you find it better\r\nthat peace and ransom should be treated of together, you will take care\r\nthat no agreement for the latter be concluded, unless the former be\r\nestablished before or in the same instant.\r\n\r\nAs to the conditions, it is understood that no peace can be made with\r\nthat government, but for a larger sum of money to be paid at once for the\r\nwhole time of its duration, or for a smaller one to be annually paid.\r\nThe former plan we entirely refuse, and adopt the latter. We have also\r\nunderstood that peace might be bought cheaper with naval stores than with\r\nmoney; but we will not furnish them with naval stores, because we think\r\nit not right to furnish them means which we know they will employ to do\r\nwrong, and because there might be no economy in it as to ourselves, in the\r\nend, as it would increase the expenses of that coercion which we may in\r\nfuture be obliged to practise towards them. The only question then, is,\r\nwhat sum of _money_ will we agree to pay them _annually_, for peace? By a\r\nletter from Captain O'Bryan, a copy of which you will receive herewith,\r\nwe have his opinion that a peace could be purchased with _money_, for\r\nsixty thousand pounds sterling, or with _naval stores_, for one hundred\r\nthousand dollars. An annual payment equivalent to the first, would be\r\nthree thousand pounds sterling, or thirteen thousand and five hundred\r\ndollars, the interest of the sum in gross. If we could obtain it for as\r\nsmall a sum as the second, in _money_, the annual payment equivalent to\r\nit would be five thousand dollars. In another part of the same letter,\r\nCaptain O'Bryan says, \"if maritime stores and two light cruisers be given,\r\nand a tribute paid in maritime stores every two years, amounting to twelve\r\nthousand dollars in America,\" a peace can be had. The gift of stores\r\nand cruisers here supposed, converted into an annual equivalent, may be\r\nstated at nine thousand dollars, and adding to it half the biennial sum,\r\nwould make fifteen thousand dollars, to be annually paid. You will, of\r\ncourse, use your best endeavors to get it at the lowest sum practicable;\r\nwhereupon I shall only say, that we should be pleased with ten thousand\r\ndollars, contented with fifteen thousand, think twenty thousand a very\r\nhard bargain, yet go as far as twenty-five thousand, if it be impossible\r\nto get it for less; but not a copper further, this being fixed by law as\r\nthe utmost limit. These are meant as annual sums. If you can put off the\r\nfirst annual payment to the end of the first year, you may employ any\r\nsum not exceeding that, in presents to be paid down; but if the first\r\npayment is to be made in hand, that and the presents cannot by law exceed\r\ntwenty-five thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nAnd here we meet a difficulty, arising from the small degree of\r\ninformation we have respecting the Barbary States. Tunis is said to\r\nbe tributary to Algiers. But whether the effect of this be, that peace\r\nbeing made with Algiers, is of course with the Tunisians without separate\r\ntreaty, or separate price, is what we know not. If it be possible to have\r\nit placed on this footing, so much the better. In any event, it will be\r\nnecessary to stipulate with Algiers, that her influence be interposed\r\nas strongly as possible with Tunis, whenever we shall proceed to treat\r\nwith the latter; which cannot be till information of the event of your\r\nnegotiation, and another session of Congress.\r\n\r\nAs to the articles and form of the treaty in general, our treaty with\r\nMorocco was so well digested that I enclose you a copy of that, to be the\r\nmodel with Algiers, as nearly as it can be obtained, only inserting the\r\nclause with respect to Tunis.\r\n\r\nThe ransom of the captives is next to be considered. They are now thirteen\r\nin number; to wit, Richard O'Bryan and Isaac Stevens, captains, Andrew\r\nMontgomery and Alexander Forsyth, mates, Jacob Tessanier, a French\r\npassenger, William Patterson, Philip Sloan, Peleg Lorin, James Hall,\r\nJames Cathcart, George Smith, John Gregory, James Hermit, seamen. It has\r\nbeen a fixed principle with Congress, to establish the rate of ransom of\r\nAmerican captives with the Barbary States at as low a point as possible,\r\nthat it may not be the interest of those States to go in quest of our\r\ncitizens in preference to those of other countries. Had it not been for\r\nthe danger it would have brought on the residue of our seamen, by exciting\r\nthe cupidity of those rovers against them, our citizens now in Algiers\r\nwould have been long ago redeemed, without regard to price. The mere money\r\nfor this particular redemption neither has been, nor is, an object with\r\nanybody here. It is from the same regard to the safety of our seamen at\r\nlarge, that they have now restrained us from any ransom unaccompanied\r\nwith peace. This being secured, we are led to consent to terms of ransom,\r\nto which, otherwise, our government never would have consented; that is\r\nto say, to the terms stated by Captain O'Bryan in the following passage\r\nof the same letter: \"By giving the minister of the marine (the present\r\nDey's favorite) the sum of one thousand sequins, I would stake my life\r\nthat we would be ransomed for thirteen thousand sequins, and all expenses\r\nincluded.\" Extravagant as this sum is, we will, under the security of\r\npeace in future, go so far; not doubting, at the same time, that you\r\nwill obtain it as much lower as possible, and not indeed without a hope\r\nthat a lower ransom will be practicable, from the assurances given us in\r\nother letters from Captain O'Bryan, that prices are likely to be abated\r\nby the present Dey, and particularly with us, towards whom he has been\r\nrepresented as well disposed. You will consider this sum, therefore, say\r\ntwenty-seven thousand dollars, as your ultimate limit, including ransom,\r\nduties, and gratifications of every kind.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ransom is completed, you will be pleased to have the\r\ncaptives well clothed and sent home at the expense of the United States,\r\nwith as much economy as will consist with their reasonable comfort. It\r\nis thought best, that Mr. Pinckney, our minister at London, should be the\r\nconfidential channel of communication between us. He is enabled to answer\r\nyour drafts for money within the limits before expressed; and as this will\r\nbe by re-drawing on Amsterdam, you must settle with him the number of days\r\n_after sight_, at which your bills shall be payable in London, so as to\r\ngive him time, in the meanwhile, to draw the money from Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nWe shall be anxious to know as soon and as often as possible, your\r\nprospects in these negotiations. You will receive herewith a cypher, which\r\nwill enable you to make them with safety. London and Lisbon (where Colonel\r\nHumphreys will forward my letters) will be the safest and best ports of\r\ncommunication. I also enclose two separate commissions, for the objects\r\nof peace and ransom. To these is added a commission to you as consul for\r\nthe United States, at Algiers, on the possibility that it might be useful\r\nfor you to remain there till the ratification of the treaties shall be\r\nreturned from hence; though you are not to delay till their return the\r\nsending the captives home, nor the necessary payments of money within the\r\nlimits before prescribed. Should you be willing to remain there, even\r\nafter the completion of the business, as consul for the United States,\r\nyou will be free to do so, giving me notice, that no other nomination\r\nmay be made. These commissions, being issued during the recess of the\r\nSenate, are in force, by the Constitution, only till the next session of\r\nthe Senate. But their renewal then is so much a matter of course and of\r\nnecessity, that you may consider that as certain, and proceed without any\r\ninterruption. I have not mentioned this in the commissions, because it is\r\nin all cases surplusage, and because it might be difficult of explanation\r\nto those to whom you are addressed.\r\n\r\nThe allowance for all your expenses and time (exclusive of the ransom,\r\nprice of peace, duties, presents, maintenance and transportation of the\r\ncaptives) is at the rate of two thousand dollars a year, to commence\r\nfrom the day on which you shall set out for Algiers, from whatever place\r\nyou may take your departure. The particular objects of peace and ransom\r\nonce out of the way, the two thousand dollars annually are to go in\r\nsatisfaction of time, services, and expenses of every kind, whether you\r\nact as consul or commissioner.\r\n\r\nAs the duration of this peace cannot be counted on with certainty, and we\r\nlook forward to the necessity of coercion by cruises on their coast, to\r\nbe kept up during the whole of their cruising season, you will be pleased\r\nto inform yourself, as minutely as possible, of every circumstance which\r\nmay influence or guide us in undertaking and conducting such an operation,\r\nmaking your communications by safe opportunities.\r\n\r\nI must recommend to your particular notice, Captain O'Bryan, one of the\r\ncaptives, from whom we have received a great deal of useful information.\r\nThe zeal which he has displayed under the trying circumstances of\r\nhis present situation, has been very distinguished. You will find him\r\nintimately acquainted with the manner in which, and characters with whom\r\nbusiness is to be done there, and perhaps he may be an useful instrument\r\nto you, especially in the outset of your undertaking, which will require\r\nthe utmost caution and the best information. He will be able to give you\r\nthe characters of the European consuls there, though you will, probably,\r\nnot think it prudent to repose confidence in any of them.\r\n\r\nShould you be able successfully to accomplish the objects of your mission\r\nin time to convey notice of it to us as early as possible during the next\r\nsession of Congress, which meets in the beginning of November and rises\r\nthe 4th of March, it would have a very pleasant effect.\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                Philadelphia, June 4, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I wrote you on the 1st inst., which I will call No. 1, and\r\nnumber my letters in future that you may know when any are missing. Mr.\r\nHammond has given me an answer in writing, saying, he must send my letter\r\nto his court and wait their instructions. On this I desired a personal\r\ninterview, that we might consider the matter together in a familiar way.\r\nHe came accordingly, yesterday, and took a solo dinner with me, during\r\nwhich our conversation was full, unreserved, and of a nature to inspire\r\nmutual confidence. The result was that he acknowledged explicitly that his\r\ncountry had hitherto heard one side of the question only, and that from\r\nprejudiced persons, that it was now for the first time discussed, that it\r\nwas placed on entirely new ground, his court having no idea of a charge of\r\nfirst infractions on them, and a justification on that ground of what had\r\nbeen done by our States, that this made it quite a new case to which no\r\ninstructions he had could apply. He found, from my expressions, that I had\r\nentertained an idea of his being able to give an order to the Governor of\r\nCanada to deliver up the posts, and smiled at the idea; and it was evident\r\nfrom his conversation that it had not at all entered into the expectations\r\nof his court that they were to deliver up the posts. He did not say so\r\nexpressly, but he said that they considered the retaining of the posts as\r\na very imperfect compensation for the losses their subjects had sustained;\r\nunder the cover of the clause of the treaty which admits them to the\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi, and the evident mistake of the negotiators\r\nin supposing that a line due west from the Lake of the Woods would strike\r\nthe Mississippi, he suppose an explanatory convention necessary, and\r\nshowed a desire that such a slice of our Northwestern Territory might be\r\ncut off for them as would admit them to the navigation and profit of the\r\nMississippi, &c., &c. He expects he can have his final instructions by\r\nthe meeting of Congress. I have not yet had the conversation mentioned in\r\nmy last. Do you remember that you were to leave me a list of names? Pray\r\nsend them to me. My only view is that, if the P. asks me for a list of\r\nparticulars, I may enumerate names to him, without naming my authority,\r\nand show him that I had not been speaking merely at random. If we do not\r\nhave our conversation before, I can make a comparative table of the debts\r\nand numbers of all modern nations. I will show him how high we stand\r\nindebted by the poll in that table. I omitted Hammond's admission that the\r\ndebt from the Potowmac North might be considered as liquidated, that that\r\nof Virginia was now the only great object, and cause of anxiety, amounting\r\nto two millions sterling. Adieu. Yours, affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS BARCLAY, ESQUIRE.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, June 11, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--Congress having furnished me with means for procuring peace, and\r\nransoming our captive citizens from the government of Algiers, I have\r\nthought it best, while you are engaged at Morocco, to appoint Admiral\r\nJones to proceed to Algiers, and therefore have sent him a commission for\r\nestablishing peace, another for the ransom of our captives, and a third\r\nto act there as consul for the United States, and full instructions are\r\ngiven in a letter from the Secretary of State to him, of all which papers,\r\nMr. Pinckney, now proceeding to London as our Minister Plenipotentiary\r\nthere, is the bearer, as he is also of this letter. It is some time,\r\nhowever, since we have heard of Admiral Jones, and as in the event of any\r\naccident to him, it might occasion an injurious delay, were the business\r\nto await new commissions from hence, I have thought it best in such an\r\nevent, that Mr. Pinckney should forward to you all the papers addressed to\r\nAdmiral Jones, with this letter, signed by myself, giving you authority on\r\nreceipt of those papers, to consider them addressed to you, and to proceed\r\nunder them in every respect as if your name stood in each of them in the\r\nplace of that of John Paul Jones. You will of course finish the business\r\nof your mission to Morocco with all the dispatch practicable, and then\r\nproceed to Algiers on that hereby confided to you, where this letter,\r\nwith the commissions addressed to Admiral Jones, and an explanation of\r\ncircumstances, will doubtless procure you credit as acting in the name\r\nand on the behalf of the United States, and more especially when you shall\r\nefficaciously prove your authority by the fact of making on the spot, the\r\npayments you shall stipulate. With full confidence in the prudence and\r\nintegrity with which you will fulfill the objects of the present mission,\r\nI give to this letter the effect of a commission and full powers, by\r\nhereunto subscribing my name, this eleventh day of June, one thousand\r\nseven hundred and ninety-two.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, June 11, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I have already had the honor of delivering to you your\r\ncommission as Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States at the court\r\nof London, and have now that of enclosing your letter of credence to the\r\nKing, sealed, and a copy of it open for your own information. Mr. Adams,\r\nyour predecessor, seemed to understand, on his being presented to that\r\ncourt, that a letter was expected for the Queen also. You will be pleased\r\nto inform yourself whether the custom of that court requires this from\r\nus: and to enable you to comply with it, if it should, I enclose a letter\r\nsealed for the Queen, and a copy of it open for your own information.\r\nShould its delivery not be requisite you will be so good as to return\r\nit, as we do not wish to set a precedent which may bind us hereafter\r\nto a single unnecessary ceremony. To you, Sir, it will be unnecessary\r\nto undertake a general delineation of the duties of the office to which\r\nyou are appointed. I shall therefore only express a desire that they be\r\nconstantly exercised in that spirit of sincere friendship which we bear to\r\nthe English nation, and that in all transactions with the minister, his\r\ngood dispositions be conciliated by whatever in language or attentions\r\nmay tend to that effect. With respect to their government, or policy, as\r\nconcerning themselves or other nations, we wish not to intermeddle in word\r\nor deed, and that it be not understood that our government permits itself\r\nto entertain either a will or opinion on the subject.\r\n\r\nI particularly recommend to you, as the most important of your charges,\r\nthe patronage of our commerce, and its liberation from embarrassments\r\nin all the British dominions; but most especially in the West Indies.\r\nOur consuls in Great Britain and Ireland are under general instructions\r\nto correspond with you, as you will perceive by a copy of a circular\r\nletter lately written to them, and now enclosed. From them you may often\r\nreceive interesting information. Mr. Joshua Johnson is consul for us at\r\nLondon, James Maury, at Liverpool, Elias Vanderhorst, at Bristol, Thomas\r\nAuldjo, vice-consul at Pool (resident at Cowes), and William Knox, consul\r\nat Dublin. The jurisdiction of each is exclusive and independent, and\r\nextends to all places within the same allegiance nearer to him than to\r\nthe residence of any other consul or vice-consul of the United States. The\r\nsettlement of their accounts from time to time, and the payment of them,\r\nare referred to you, and in this, the act respecting consuls and any other\r\nlaws made, or to be made, are to be your guide. Charges which these do\r\nnot authorize, you will be pleased not to allow. These accounts are to be\r\nsettled up to the first day of July in every year, and to be transmitted\r\nto the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar custom in England, of impressing seamen on every appearance\r\nof war, will occasionally expose our seamen to peculiar oppressions and\r\nvexations. These will require your most active exertions and protection,\r\nwhich we know cannot be effectual without incurring considerable expense;\r\nand as no law has as yet provided for this, we think it fairer to take\r\nthe risk of it on the executive than to leave it on your shoulders. You\r\nwill, therefore, with all due economy, and on the best vouchers the nature\r\nof the case will admit, meet those expenses, transmitting an account of\r\nthem to the Secretary of State, to be communicated to the Legislature.\r\nIt will be expedient that you take proper opportunities in the meantime,\r\nof conferring with the minister on this subject, in order to form some\r\narrangement for the protection of our seamen on those occasions. We\r\nentirely reject the mode which was the subject of a conversation between\r\nMr. Morris and him, which was, that our seamen should always carry about\r\nthem certificates of their citizenship. This is a condition never yet\r\nsubmitted to by any nation, one with which seamen would never have the\r\nprecaution to comply; the casualties of their calling would expose them\r\nto the constant destruction or loss of this paper evidence, and thus,\r\nthe British government would be armed with _legal authority_ to impress\r\nthe whole of our seamen. The simplest rule will be, that the vessel\r\nbeing American, shall be evidence that the seamen on board her are such.\r\nIf they apprehend that our vessels might thus become asylums for the\r\nfugitives of their own nation from impress-gangs, the number of men to\r\nbe protected by a vessel may be limited by her tonnage, and one or two\r\nofficers only be permitted to enter the vessel in order to examine the\r\nnumbers on board; but no press-gang should be allowed ever to go on board\r\nan American vessel, till after it shall be found that there are more than\r\ntheir stipulated number on board, nor till after the master shall have\r\nrefused to deliver the supernumeraries (to be named by himself) to the\r\npress-officer who has come on board for that purpose; and even then, the\r\nAmerican consul should be called in. In order to urge a settlement of this\r\npoint, before a new occasion may arise, it may not be amiss to draw their\r\nattention to the peculiar irritation excited on the last occasion, and\r\nthe difficulty of avoiding our making immediate reprisals on their seamen\r\nhere. You will be so good as to communicate to me what shall pass on this\r\nsubject, and it may be made an article of convention, to be entered into\r\neither there or here.\r\n\r\nYou will receive herewith a copy of the journals of the ancient Congress,\r\nand of the laws, journals and reports of the present. Those for the\r\nfuture, with gazettes and other interesting papers, shall be sent you\r\nfrom time to time; and I shall leave you generally to the gazettes, for\r\nwhatever information is in possession of the public, and shall especially\r\nundertake to communicate by letter, such only relative to the business\r\nof your mission as the gazetteers cannot give. From you I ask, once or\r\ntwice a month, a communication of interesting occurrences in England,\r\nof the general affairs of Europe, the court gazette, the best paper in\r\nthe interest of the ministry and the best of the opposition party, most\r\nparticularly, that one of each which shall give the best account of the\r\ndebates of parliament, the parliamentary register annually, and such\r\nother political publications as may be important enough to be read by one\r\nwho can spare little time to read anything, or which may contain matter\r\nproper to be kept and turned to, on interesting subjects and occasions.\r\nThe English packet is the most certain channel for such epistolary\r\ncommunications as are not very secret, and intermediate occasions by\r\nprivate vessels may be resorted to for secret communications, and for such\r\nas would come too expensively burthened with postage, by the packets. You\r\nare furnished with a cypher for greater secrecy of communication. To the\r\npapers before mentioned, I must desire you to add the Leyden gazette,\r\npaper by paper as it comes out, by the first vessel sailing after its\r\nreceipt.\r\n\r\nI enclose you the papers in the case of a Mr. Wilson, ruined by the\r\ncapture of his vessel, after the term limited by the armistice. They will\r\ninform you of the circumstances of his case, and where you may find him\r\npersonally, and I recommend his case to your particular representations\r\nto the British court. It is possible that other similar cases may be\r\ntransmitted to you. You have already received some letters of Mr. Adams'\r\nexplanations of the principles of the armistice, and of what had passed\r\nbetween him and the British minister on the subject.\r\n\r\nMr. Greene, of Rhode Island, will deliver you his papers, and I am to\r\ndesire that you may patronize his claims so far as shall be just and\r\nright, leaving to himself and his agent to follow up the minute details of\r\nsolicitation, and coming forward yourself only when there shall be proper\r\noccasion for you to do so in the name of your nation.\r\n\r\nMr. Cutting has a claim against the government, vouchers for which he is\r\nto procure from England. As you are acquainted with the circumstances of\r\nit, I have only to desire that you will satisfy yourself as to the facts\r\nrelative thereto, the evidence of which cannot be transmitted, and that\r\nyou will communicate the same to me, that justice may be done between the\r\npublic and the claimant.\r\n\r\nWe shall have occasion to ask your assistance in procuring a workman or\r\ntwo for our mint; but this shall be the subject of a separate letter,\r\nafter I shall have received more particular explanations from the director\r\nof the mint.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, June 11, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--The letter I have addressed to Admiral Jones, of which you have\r\nhad the perusal, has informed you of the mission with which the President\r\nhas thought proper to charge him at Algiers, and how far your agency is\r\ndesired for conveying to him the several papers, for receiving and paying\r\nhis drafts to the amount therein permitted, by re-drawing yourself on\r\nour bankers in Amsterdam who are instructed to honor your bills, and by\r\nacting as a channel of correspondence between us. It has been some time,\r\nhowever, since we have heard of Admiral Jones. Should any accident have\r\nhappened to his life, or should you be unable to learn where he is, or\r\nshould distance, refusal to act, or any other circumstance deprive us of\r\nhis services on this occasion, or be likely to produce too great a delay,\r\nof which you are to be the judge, you will then be pleased to send all\r\nthe papers confided to you for him, to Mr. Thomas Barclay, our consul at\r\nMorocco, with the letter addressed to him, which is delivered you open,\r\nand by which you will perceive that he is, in that event, substituted\r\nto every intent and purpose in the place of Admiral Jones. You will be\r\npleased not to pass any of the papers confided to you on this business,\r\nthrough any post office.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, June 14, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--The United States being now about to establish a mint, it becomes\r\nnecessary to ask your assistance in procuring persons to carry on some\r\nparts of it; and to enable you to give it, you must be apprised of some\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nCongress, some time ago, authorized the President to take measures for\r\nprocuring some artists from any place where they were to be had. It was\r\nknown that a Mr. Drost, a Swiss, had made an improvement in the method\r\nof coining, and some specimens of his coinage were exhibited here, which\r\nwere superior to anything we had ever seen. Mr. Short was, therefore,\r\nauthorized to engage Drost to come over, to erect the proper machinery,\r\nand instruct persons to go on with the coinage; and as he supposed this\r\nwould require about a year, we agreed to give him a thousand louis a year\r\nand his expenses. The agreement was made, two coining mills, or screws,\r\nwere ordered by him; but in the end, he declined coming. We have reason to\r\nbelieve he was drawn off by the English East India Company, and that he is\r\nnow at work for them in England. Mr. Bolton had also made a proposition\r\nto coin for us in England, which was declined. Since this, the act has\r\nbeen passed for establishing our mint, which authorizes, among other\r\nthings, the employment of an assayer at fifteen hundred dollars a year,\r\na chief coiner at the same, and an engraver at twelve hundred dollars.\r\nBut it admits of the employment of one person, both as engraver and chief\r\ncoiner; this we expect may be done, as we presume that any engraver who\r\nhas been used to work for a coinage, must be well enough acquainted with\r\nall the operations of coinage to direct them; and it is an economy worth\r\nattention, if we can have the services performed by one officer instead\r\nof two, in which case, it is proposed to give him the salary of the chief\r\ncoiner, that is to say, fifteen hundred dollars a year. I have, therefore,\r\nto request that you will endeavor, on your arrival in Europe, to engage\r\nand send us an assayer of approved skill and well-attested integrity,\r\nand a chief coiner and engraver, in one person, if possible, acquainted\r\nwith all the improvements in coining, and particularly those of Drost\r\nand Bolton. Their salaries may commence from the day of their sailing\r\nfor America. If Drost be in England, I think he will feel himself under\r\nsome obligation to aid you in procuring persons. How far Bolton will do\r\nit, seems uncertain. You will, doubtless, make what you can of the good\r\ndispositions of either of these or any other person. Should you find it\r\nimpracticable to procure an engraver capable of performing the functions\r\nof chief coiner also, we must be content that you engage separate\r\ncharacters. Let these persons bring with them all the implements necessary\r\nfor carrying on the business, except such as you shall think too bulky\r\nand easily made here. It would be proper, therefore, that they should\r\nconsult you as to the necessary implements and their prices, that they may\r\nact under your control. The method of your paying for these implements\r\nand making reasonable advances to the workmen, shall be the subject of\r\nanother letter, after the President shall have decided thereon. It should\r\nbe a part of the agreement of these people, that they will faithfully\r\ninstruct all persons in their art, whom we shall put under them for that\r\npurpose. Your contract with them, may be made for any term not exceeding\r\nfour years.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and much esteem, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. Should you not be able to procure persons of eminent qualifications\r\nfor their business, in England, it will be proper to open a correspondence\r\nwith Mr. Morris on the subject, and see whether he cannot get such\r\nfrom France. Next to the obtaining the ablest artists, a very important\r\ncircumstance is to send them to us as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, June 16, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--My last to you was of March the 28th. Yours of April the 6th\r\nand 10th came to hand three days ago.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the particular objects of commerce susceptible of being\r\nplaced on a better footing, on which you ask my ideas, they will show\r\nthemselves by the enclosed table of the situation of our commerce with\r\nFrance and England. That with France is stated as it stood at the time\r\nI left that country, when the only objects whereon change was still\r\ndesirable, were those of salted provisions, tobacco and tar, pitch and\r\nturpentine. The first was in negotiation when I came away, and was pursued\r\nby Mr. Short with prospects of success, till their general tariff so\r\nunexpectedly deranged our commerce with them as to other articles. Our\r\ncommerce with their West Indies had never admitted amelioration during\r\nmy stay in France. The temper of that period did not allow even the\r\nessay, and it was as much as we could do to hold the ground given us by\r\nthe Marshal de Castries' _Arret_, admitting us to their colonies with\r\nsalted provisions, &c. As to both these branches of commerce, to wit,\r\nwith France and her colonies, we have hoped they would pursue their own\r\nproposition of arranging them by treaty, and that we could draw that\r\ntreaty to this place. There is no other where the dependence of their\r\ncolonies on our States for their prosperity is so obvious as here, nor\r\nwhere their negotiator would feel it so much. But it would be imprudent\r\nto leave to the uncertain issue of such a treaty, the re-establishment\r\nof our commerce with _France_ on the footing on which it was in the\r\nbeginning of their revolution. That treaty may be long on the anvil; in\r\nthe meantime, we cannot consent to the late innovations, without taking\r\nmeasures to do justice to our own navigation. This object, therefore, is\r\nparticularly recommended to you, while you will also be availing yourself\r\nof every opportunity which may arise, of benefiting our commerce in any\r\nother part. I am in hopes you will have found the moment favorable on your\r\narrival in France, when Monsieur Claviere was in the ministry, and the\r\ndispositions of the National Assembly favorable to the ministers. Your\r\ncypher has not been sent hitherto, because it required a most confidential\r\nchannel of conveyance. It is now committed to Mr. Pinckney, who also\r\ncarries the gazettes, laws, and other public papers for you. We have been\r\nlong without any vessel going to Havre. Some of the Indian tribes have\r\nacceded to terms of peace. The greater part, however, still hold off,\r\nand oblige us to pursue more vigorous measures for war. I enclose you an\r\nextract from a circular letter to our consuls, by which you will perceive\r\nthat those in countries where we have no diplomatic representative, are\r\ndesired to settle their accounts annually with the minister of the United\r\nStates at Paris. This business, I must desire you to undertake. The act\r\nconcerning consuls will be your guide, and I shall be glad that the first\r\nof July be the day to which their accounts shall be annually settled and\r\npaid, and that they may be forwarded as soon after that as possible to\r\nthe office of the Secretary of State, to enter into the general account\r\nof his department, which it is necessary he should make up always before\r\nthe meeting of Congress.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. I have said nothing of our whale oil, because I believe it is on a\r\nbetter footing since the tariff than before.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, June 16, 1792.\r\n\r\nBehold you, then, my dear friend, at the head of a great army establishing\r\nthe liberties of your country against a foreign enemy. May heaven favor\r\nyour cause, and make you the channel through which it may pour its\r\nfavors. While you are estimating the monster Aristocracy, and pulling out\r\nthe teeth and fangs of its associate, Monarchy, a contrary tendency is\r\ndiscovered in some here. A sect has shown itself among us, who declare\r\nthey espoused our new Constitution not as a good and sufficient thing in\r\nitself, but only as a step to an English constitution, the only thing\r\ngood and sufficient in itself, in their eye. It is happy for us that\r\nthese are preachers without followers, and that our people are firm and\r\nconstant in their republican purity. You will wonder to be told that it\r\nis from the eastward chiefly that these champions for a king, lords, and\r\ncommons, come. They get some important associates from New York, and are\r\npuffed up by a tribe of Agioteurs which have been hatched in a bed of\r\ncorruption made up after the model of their beloved England. Too many\r\nof these stock-jobbers and king-jobbers have come into our Legislature,\r\nor rather too many of our Legislature have become stock-jobbers and\r\nking-jobbers. However, the voice of the people is beginning to make itself\r\nheard, and will probably cleanse their seats at the ensuing election.\r\nThe machinations of our old enemies are such as to keep us still at\r\nbay with our Indian neighbors. What are you doing for your colonies?\r\nThey will be lost, if not more effectually succored. Indeed, no future\r\nefforts you can make will ever be able to reduce the blacks. All that\r\ncan be done, in my opinion, will be to compound with them, as has been\r\ndone formerly in Jamaica. We have been less zealous in aiding them, lest\r\nyour government should feel any jealousy on our account. But, in truth,\r\nwe as sincerely wish their restoration and their connection with you, as\r\nyou do yourselves. We are satisfied that neither your justice nor their\r\ndistresses will ever again permit their being forced to seek at dear and\r\ndistant markets those first necessaries of life which they may have at\r\ncheaper markets, placed by nature at their door, and formed by her for\r\ntheir support. What is become of Madame de Tessy and Madame de Tott? I\r\nhave not heard of them since they went to Switzerland. I think they would\r\nhave done better to have come and reposed under the poplars of Virginia.\r\nPour into their bosoms the warmest effusions of my friendship, and tell\r\nthem they will be warm and constant unto death. Accept of them also for\r\nMadame de La Fayette, and your dear children; but I am forgetting that\r\nyou are in the field of war, and they I hope in those of peace. Adieu, my\r\ndear friend. God bless you all. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BARLOW.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, June 20, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Though I am in hopes you are now on the ocean home-bound, yet\r\nI cannot omit the chance of my thanks reaching you, for your \"Conspiracy\r\nof Kings\" and advice to the privileged orders, the second part of which I\r\nam in hopes is out by this time. Be assured that your endeavors to bring\r\nthe trans-Atlantic world into the road of reason, are not without their\r\neffect here. Some here are disposed to move retrograde, and to take their\r\nstand in the rear of Europe, now advancing to the high ground of natural\r\nright; but of all this your friend Mr. Baldwin gives you information, and\r\ndoubtless paints to you the indignation with which the heresies of some\r\npeople here fill us.\r\n\r\nThis will be conveyed by Mr. Pinckney, an honest, sensible man, and good\r\nrepublican. He goes our Minister Plenipotentiary to London. He will arrive\r\nat an interesting moment in Europe. God send that all the nations who join\r\nin attacking the liberties of France may end in the attainment of their\r\nown. I still hope this will not find you in Europe, and therefore add\r\nnothing more than assurances of affectionate esteem from, dear Sir, your\r\nsincere friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PETER CARR.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, June 22, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I received in due time your favor of May 28, with the notes\r\nit contained on the subject of Waste. Your view of the subject, as far\r\nas it goes, is perfectly proper. Perhaps, on such a question in this\r\ncountry, where the husbandry is so different, it might be necessary to go\r\nfurther, and inquire whether any difference of this kind should produce\r\na difference in the law. The main objects of the law of waste in England\r\nare, 1st, to prevent any disguise of the lands which might lessen the\r\nrevisioner's evidence of title, such as the change of pasture into arable;\r\n2d, to prevent any deterioration of it, as the cutting down forest, which\r\nin England is an injury. So careful is the law there against permitting\r\na deterioration of the land, that though it will permit such improvements\r\n_in the same line_, as manuring arable lands, leading water into pasture\r\nlands, &c., yet it will not permit improvements _in a different line_,\r\nsuch as erecting buildings, converting pasture into arable, &c., lest\r\nthis should lead to a deterioration. Hence we might argue in Virginia,\r\nthat though the cutting down of forest in Virginia is, in our husbandry,\r\nrather an improvement generally, yet it is not so always, and therefore it\r\nis safer never to admit it. Consequently, there is no reason for adopting\r\ndifferent rules of waste here from those established in England.\r\n\r\nYour objection to Lord Kaims, that he is too metaphysical, is just, and\r\nit is the chief objection to which his writings are liable. It is to\r\nbe observed also, that though he has given us what should be the system\r\nof equity, yet it is not the one actually established, at least not in\r\nall its parts. The English Chancellors have gone on from one thing to\r\nanother without any comprehensive or systematic view of the whole field\r\nof equity, and therefore they have sometimes run into inconsistencies and\r\ncontradictions.\r\n\r\nNever fear the want of business. A man who qualifies himself well for\r\nhis calling, never fails of employment in it. The foundation you will\r\nhave laid in legal reading, will enable you to take a higher ground than\r\nmost of your competitors, and even ignorant men can see who it is that\r\nis not one of themselves. Go on then with courage, and you will be sure\r\nof success; for which be assured no one wishes more ardently, nor has\r\nmore sincere sentiments of friendship towards you, than, dear Sir, your\r\naffectionate friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. VAN BERCKEL.\r\n\r\n                                                Philadelphia, July 2, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--It was with extreme concern that I learned from your letter of\r\nJune the 25th, that a violation of the protection due to you as the\r\nrepresentative of your nation had been committed, by an officer of this\r\nState entering your house and serving therein a process on one of your\r\nservants. There could be no question but that this was a breach of\r\nprivilege; the only one was, how it was to be punished. To ascertain\r\nthis, I referred your letter to the Attorney General, whose answer I\r\nhave the honor to enclose you. By this you will perceive, that from the\r\ncircumstance of your servant's not being registered in the Secretary\r\nof State's office, we cannot avail ourselves of the more certain and\r\neffectual proceeding which had been provided by an act of Congress for\r\npunishing infractions of the law of nations, that act having thought\r\nproper to confine the benefit of its provisions to such domestics only, as\r\nshould have been registered. We are to proceed, therefore, as if that act\r\nhad never been made, and the Attorney General's letter indicates two modes\r\nof proceeding. 1. By a warrant before a single magistrate, to recover the\r\nmoney paid by the servant under a process declared void by law. Herein\r\nthe servant must be the actor, and the government not intermeddle at all.\r\nThe smallness of the sum to be re-demanded will place this cause in the\r\nclass of those in which no appeal to the higher tribunal is permitted,\r\neven in the case of manifest error, so that if the magistrate should err,\r\nthe government has no means of correcting the error. 2. The second mode\r\nof proceeding would be, to indict the officer in the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States; with whom it would rest to punish him at their discretion,\r\nin proportion to the injury done and the malice from which it proceeded;\r\nand it would end in punishment alone, and not in a restitution of the\r\nmoney. In this mode of proceeding, the government of the United States is\r\nactor, taking the management of the cause into its own hands, and giving\r\nyou no other trouble than that of bearing witness to such material facts\r\nas may not be otherwise supported. You will be so good as to decide in\r\nwhich of these two ways you would choose the proceeding should be; if\r\nthe latter, I will immediately take measures for having the offender\r\nprosecuted according to law.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA.\r\n\r\n                                                Philadelphia, July 3, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have the honor to enclose to your Excellency, the copy of a\r\nletter I have received from his Catholic Majesty's representatives\r\nhere, in consequence of a complaint from the Governor of Florida, that\r\nthree inhabitants of the State of Georgia, to wit, Thomas Harrison,\r\nDavid Rees, and William Ewin, had entered the Spanish territory and\r\nbrought from thence five negro slaves, the property of John Blackwood, a\r\nSpanish subject, without his consent, in violation of the rights of that\r\nState and the peace of the two countries. I had formerly had the honor\r\nof sending you a copy of the convention entered into between the said\r\nGovernor and Mr. Leagrove, on the part of the United States for the mutual\r\nrestitution of fugitive slaves. I now take the liberty of requesting your\r\nExcellency to inform me what is done, or likely to be done with you for\r\nthe satisfaction of the Spanish government in this instance. Nobody knows\r\nbetter than your Excellency the importance of restraining individuals from\r\ncommitting the peace and honor of the two nations, and I am persuaded that\r\nnothing will be wanting on your part to satisfy the just expectations of\r\nthe government of Florida on the present occasion. I have the honor to\r\nbe, with great respect, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. DE VIAR AND JAUDENES.\r\n\r\n                                                Philadelphia, July 9, 1792.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--Information has been received that the government of West\r\nFlorida has established an agent within the territory of the United\r\nStates, belonging to the Creek Indians, and it is even pretended that\r\nthat agent has excited those Indians to oppose the making a boundary\r\nbetween their district and that of the citizens of the United States.\r\nThe latter is so inconsistent with the dispositions to friendship and\r\ngood neighborhood which Spain has always expressed towards us, with that\r\nconcert of interest which would be so advantageous to the two nations, and\r\nwhich we are disposed sincerely to promote, that we find no difficulty in\r\nsupposing it erroneous. The sending an agent within our limits we presume\r\nhas been done without the authority or knowledge of your Government.\r\nIt has certainly been the usage, where one nation has wished to employ\r\nagents of any kind within the limits of another, to obtain the permission\r\nof that other, and even to regulate by convention and on principles of\r\nreciprocity, the functions to be exercised by such agents. It is not\r\nto a nation whose dominions are circumstanced as those of Spain in our\r\nneighborhood, that we need develop the inconveniences of permitting\r\nreciprocally the unlicensed mission of agents into the territories of each\r\nother. I am persuaded nothing more is necessary than to bring the fact\r\nunder the notice of your Government in order to its being rectified, which\r\nis the object of my addressing you on this occasion; with every assurance\r\nthat you will make the proper communications on the subject to your court.\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of perfect esteem and respect,\r\nGentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, July 12, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--We have been very long indeed without any vessel going from\r\nthis port to Lisbon. This is the reason why I have been so long without\r\nacknowledging the receipt of your letters. Your Nos. from 45 to 53\r\ninclusive are received, except No. 52, not yet come to hand. The President\r\nset out yesterday for Virginia, and I shall follow him to-morrow. During\r\nmy absence the public papers will be forwarded to you by every opportunity\r\nby Mr. Taylor, with whom this letter is left, as we know of no present\r\nopportunity of forwarding it. The State of Vermont has lately taken some\r\ndecisive step to extend its jurisdiction nearer to the British ports than\r\nhas hitherto been done. This has produced a complaint from Mr. Hammond. We\r\nshall endeavor to keep things quiet, in hopes of voluntary justice from\r\nthem. We shall probably have no campaign this year against the Indians.\r\nThere are some hopes they will accept of peace and the rather as we have\r\nnever asked anything in return for it. We really wish not to hurt them. I\r\nneed not repeat occurrences which you will see in the gazettes. I am, with\r\ngreat and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR LEE.\r\n\r\n                                               Monticello, August 13, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--It was not till yesterday that I was honored with the receipt\r\nof yours of July 23d, or it should have been sooner answered. I am of\r\nopinion that all communications between nations should pass through the\r\nchannels of their Executives. However, in the instance of condolence on\r\nthe death of Dr. Franklin, the letter from our general government was\r\naddressed to the President of the National Assembly; so was a letter\r\nfrom the Legislature of Pennsylvania, containing congratulations on the\r\nachievement of liberty to the French nation. I have not heard that, in\r\neither instance, their Executive took it amiss that they were not made\r\nthe channel of communication. Perhaps, therefore, this method may at\r\npresent be the safest, as it is not quite certain that the sentiments of\r\ntheir executive and legislative are exactly the same on the subject on\r\nwhich you have to address them. I cannot better justify the honor of your\r\nconsultation than by thus giving you my ideas without reserve, and beg you\r\nto be assured of the sentiments of respect and esteem, with which I have\r\nthe honor to be, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PALESKE.\r\n\r\n                                               Monticello, August 19, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have received at this place your favor of the 9th instant, wherein\r\nyou request, that agreeably to the treaty of commerce between the United\r\nStates and his Prussian Majesty, his consul general be acknowledged as\r\nbelonging to a most favored nation; that the privileges and immunities\r\ndue to a consul general of the most favored nation be granted to his\r\nconsul general, and that commissioners be appointed to regulate, by\r\nparticular convention, the functions of the consuls and vice-consuls of\r\nthe respective nations.\r\n\r\nTreaties of the United States duly made and ratified, as is that with\r\nhis Prussian Majesty, constitute a part of the law of the land, and need\r\nonly promulgation to oblige all persons to obey them, and to entitle\r\nall to those privileges which such treaties confer. That promulgation\r\nhaving taken place, no other act is necessary or proper on the part of\r\nour government, according to our rules of proceeding, to give effect to\r\nthe treaty. This treaty, however, has not specified the privileges or\r\nfunctions of consuls; it has only provided that these \"shall be regulated\r\nby particular agreement.\" To the proposition to proceed as speedily as\r\npossible to regulate these functions by a convention, my absence from the\r\nseat of government does not allow me to give a definitive answer. I know,\r\nin general, that it would be agreeable to our government, on account of\r\nthe recent changes in its form, to suspend for awhile the contracting\r\nspecific engagements with foreign nations, until something more shall be\r\nseen of the direction it will take, and of its mode of operation, in order\r\nthat our engagements may be so moulded to that, as to insure the exact\r\nperformance of them which we are desirous ever to observe. Should this be\r\nthe sentiment of our government on the present occasion, the friendship of\r\nhis Prussian Majesty is a sufficient reliance to us for that delay which\r\nour affairs might require for the present; and the rather, as his vessels\r\nare not yet in the habit of seeking our ports, and for the few cases which\r\nmay occur for some time, our own laws, copied mostly in this respect\r\nfrom those of a very commercial nation, have made the most material of\r\nthose provisions which could be admitted into a special convention for\r\nthe protection of vessels, their crews and cargoes, coming hither. We\r\nshall on this, however, and every other occasion, do everything we can to\r\nmanifest our friendship to his Prussian Majesty and our desire to promote\r\ncommercial intercourse with his subjects; and of this, we hope, he will\r\nbe fully assured.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MINISTER PLENIPOTENTIARY OF FRANCE.\r\n\r\n                                                           August 27, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--Your letter of the 2d instant, informing me that the Legislative\r\nbody, on the proposition of the King of the French, had declared war\r\nagainst the King of Hungary and Bohemia, has been duly received, and is\r\nlaid before the President of the United States; and I am authorized to\r\nconvey to you the expression of the sincere concern we feel on learning\r\nthat the French nation, to whose friendship and interests we have the\r\nstrongest attachment, are now to encounter the evils of war. We offer our\r\nprayers to Heaven that its duration may be short, and its course marked\r\nwith as few as may be of those calamities which render the condition of\r\nwar so afflicting to humanity, and we add assurances that, during its\r\ncourse, we shall continue in the same friendly dispositions, and render\r\nall those good offices which shall be consistent with the duties of a\r\nneutral nation.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                             Monticello, September 9, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I received on the 2d instant the letter of August 23d,\r\nwhich you did me the honor to write me; but the immediate return of our\r\npost, contrary to his custom, prevented my answer by that occasion. The\r\nproceedings of Spain, mentioned in your letter, are really of a complexion\r\nto excite uneasiness, and a suspicion that their friendly overtures\r\nabout the Mississippi, have been merely to lull us while they should be\r\nstrengthening their holds on that river. Mr. Carmichael's silence has\r\nbeen long my astonishment; and however it might have justified something\r\nvery different from a new appointment, yet the public interest certainly\r\ncalled for his junction with Mr. Short, as it is impossible but that\r\nhis knowledge of the ground of negotiation, of persons and characters,\r\nmust be useful and even necessary to the success of the mission. That\r\nSpain and Great Britain may understand one another on our frontiers\r\nis very possible; for however opposite their interests or disposition\r\nmay be in the affairs of Europe, yet while these do not call them into\r\nopposite action, they may concur as against us. I consider their keeping\r\nan agent in the Indian country as a circumstance which requires serious\r\ninterference on our part; and I submit to your decision whether it does\r\nnot furnish a proper occasion to us to send an additional instruction to\r\nMessrs. Carmichael and Short to insist on a mutual and formal stipulation\r\nto forbear employing agents or pensioning any persons within each other's\r\nlimits; and if this be refused, to propose the contrary stipulation, to\r\nwit, that each party may freely keep agents within the Indian territories\r\nof the other, in which case we might soon sicken them of the license.\r\n\r\nI now take the liberty of proceeding to that part of your letter wherein\r\nyou notice the internal dissensions which have taken place within our\r\ngovernment, and their disagreeable effect on its movements. That such\r\ndissensions have taken place is certain, and even among those who are\r\nnearest to you in the administration. To no one have they given deeper\r\nconcern than myself; to no one equal mortification at being myself\r\na part of them. Though I take to myself no more than my share of the\r\ngeneral observations of your letter, yet I am so desirous ever that you\r\nshould know the whole truth, and believe no more than the truth, that\r\nI am glad to seize every occasion of developing to you whatever I do or\r\nthink relative to the government; and shall, therefore, ask permission\r\nto be more lengthy now than the occasion particularly calls for, or could\r\notherwise perhaps justify.\r\n\r\nWhen I embarked in the government, it was with a determination to\r\nintermeddle not at all with the Legislature, and as little as possible\r\nwith my co-departments. The first and only instance of variance from\r\nthe former part of my resolution, I was duped into by the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, and made a tool for forwarding his schemes, not then\r\nsufficiently understood by me; and of all the errors of my political life,\r\nthis has occasioned me the deepest regret. It has ever been my purpose to\r\nexplain this to you, when, from being actors on the scene, we shall have\r\nbecome uninterested spectators only. The second part of my resolution has\r\nbeen religiously observed with the War Department; and as to that of the\r\nTreasury, has never been further swerved from than by the mere enunciation\r\nof my sentiments in conversation, and chiefly among those who, expressing\r\nthe same sentiments, drew mine from me. If it has been supposed that I\r\nhave ever intrigued among the members of the Legislature to defeat the\r\nplans of the Secretary of the Treasury, it is contrary to all truth. As\r\nI never had the desire to influence the members, so neither had I any\r\nother means than my friendships, which I valued too highly to risk by\r\nusurpation on their freedom of judgment, and the conscientious pursuit of\r\ntheir own sense of duty. That I have utterly, in my private conversations,\r\ndisapproved of the system of the Secretary of the Treasury, I acknowledge\r\nand avow; and this was not merely a speculative difference. His system\r\nflowed from principles adverse to liberty, and was calculated to undermine\r\nand demolish the Republic, by creating an influence of his department over\r\nthe members of the Legislature. I saw this influence actually produced,\r\nand its first fruits to be the establishment of the great outlines of his\r\nproject by the votes of the very persons who, having swallowed his bait,\r\nwere laying themselves out to profit by his plans; and that had these\r\npersons withdrawn, as those interested in a question ever should, the\r\nvote of the disinterested majority was clearly the reverse of what they\r\nmade it. These were no longer the votes then of the representatives of\r\nthe people, but of deserters from the rights and interests of the people;\r\nand it was impossible to consider their decisions, which had nothing\r\nin view but to enrich themselves, as the measures of the fair majority,\r\nwhich ought always to be respected. If, what was actually doing, begat\r\nuneasiness in those who wished for virtuous government, what was further\r\nproposed was not less threatening to the friends of the Constitution.\r\nFor, in a report on the subject of manufactures, (still to be acted\r\non,) it was expressly assumed that the General Government has a right to\r\nexercise all powers which may be for the _general welfare_, that is to\r\nsay, all the legitimate powers of government; since no government has a\r\nlegitimate right to do what is not for the welfare of the governed. There\r\nwas, indeed, a sham limitation of the universality of this power _to cases\r\nwhere money is to be employed_. But about what is it that money cannot be\r\nemployed? Thus the object of these plans, taken together, is to draw all\r\nthe powers of government into the hands of the general Legislature, to\r\nestablish means for corrupting a sufficient corps in that Legislature to\r\ndivide the honest votes, and preponderate, by their own, the scale which\r\nsuited, and to have the corps under the command of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, for the purpose of subverting, step by step, the principles of\r\nthe Constitution which he has so often declared to be a thing of nothing,\r\nwhich must be changed. Such views might have justified something more than\r\nmere expressions of dissent, beyond which, nevertheless, I never went. Has\r\nabstinence from the department, committed to me, been equally observed by\r\nhim? To say nothing of other interferences equally known, in the case of\r\nthe two nations, with which we have the most intimate connections, France\r\nand England, my system was to give some satisfactory distinctions to the\r\nformer, of little cost to us, in return for the solid advantages yielded\r\nus by them; and to have met the English with some restrictions which might\r\ninduce them to abate their severities against our commerce. I have always\r\nsupposed this coincided with your sentiments. Yet the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, by his cabals with members of the Legislature, and by high-toned\r\ndeclamations on other occasions, has forced down his own system, which was\r\nexactly the reverse. He undertook, of his own authority, the conferences\r\nwith the ministers of those two nations, and was, on every consultation,\r\nprovided with some report of a conversation with the one or the other\r\nof them, adapted to his views. These views, thus made to prevail, their\r\nexecution fell, of course, to me; and I can safely appeal to you, who\r\nhave seen all my letters and proceedings, whether I have not carried\r\nthem into execution as sincerely as if they had been my own, though I\r\never considered them as inconsistent with the honor and interest of our\r\ncountry. That they have been inconsistent with our interest is but too\r\nfatally proved by the stab to our navigation given by the French. So that\r\nif the question be by whose fault is it that Colonel Hamilton and myself\r\nhave not drawn together? the answer will depend on that to two other\r\nquestions, whose principles of administration best justify, by their\r\npurity, conscientious adherence? and which of us has, notwithstanding,\r\nstepped farthest into the control of the department of the other?\r\n\r\nTo this justification of opinions, expressed in the way of conversation,\r\nagainst the views of Colonel Hamilton, I beg leave to add some notice of\r\nhis late charges against me in Fenno's Gazette; for neither the style,\r\nmatter, nor venom of the pieces alluded to, can leave a doubt of their\r\nauthor. Spelling my name and character at full length to the public,\r\nwhile he conceals his own under the signature of \"An American,\" he\r\ncharges me, 1st. With having written letters from Europe to my friends\r\nto oppose the present Constitution, while depending. 2d. With a desire\r\nof not paying the public debt. 3d. With setting up a paper to decry and\r\nslander the government. 1st. The first charge is most false. No man in the\r\nUnited States, I suppose, approved of every tittle in the Constitution:\r\nno one, I believe, approved more of it than I did, and more of it was\r\ncertainly disapproved by my accuser than by me, and of its parts most\r\nvitally republican. Of this the few letters I wrote on the subject (not\r\nhalf a dozen I believe) will be a proof; and for my own satisfaction and\r\njustification, I must tax you with the reading of them when I return to\r\nwhere they are. You will there see that my objection to the Constitution\r\nwas, that it wanted a bill of rights securing freedom of religion,\r\nfreedom of the press, freedom from standing armies, trial by jury, and\r\na constant habeas corpus act. Colonel Hamilton's was, that it wanted a\r\nking and house of lords. The sense of America has approved my objection\r\nand added the bill of rights, not the king and lords. I also thought\r\na longer term of service, insusceptible of renewal, would have made a\r\nPresident more independent. My country has thought otherwise, I have\r\nacquiesced implicitly. He wishes the General Government should have power\r\nto make laws binding the States in all cases whatsoever. Our country has\r\nthought otherwise: has he acquiesced? Notwithstanding my wish for a bill\r\nof rights, my letters strongly urged the adoption of the Constitution, by\r\nnine States at least, to secure the good it contained. I at first thought\r\nthat the best method of securing the bill of rights would be for four\r\nStates to hold off till such a bill should be agreed to. But the moment\r\nI saw Mr. Hancock's proposition to pass the Constitution as it stood,\r\nand give perpetual instructions to the representatives of every State to\r\ninsist on a bill of rights, I acknowledged the superiority of his plan,\r\nand advocated universal adoption. 2d. The second charge is equally untrue.\r\nMy whole correspondence while in France, and every word, letter and act\r\non the subject, since my return, prove that no man is more ardently intent\r\nto see the public debt soon and sacredly paid off than I am. This exactly\r\nmarks the difference between Colonel Hamilton's views and mine, that I\r\nwould wish the debt paid to-morrow; he wishes it never to be paid, but\r\nalways to be a thing wherewith to corrupt and manage the Legislature.\r\n3d. I have never enquired what number of sons, relatives and friends of\r\nSenators, Representatives, printers or other useful partisans Colonel\r\nHamilton has provided for among the hundred clerks of his department, the\r\nthousand excisemen, at his nod, and spread over the Union; nor could ever\r\nhave imagined that the man who has the shuffling of millions backwards\r\nand forwards from paper into money and money into paper, from Europe to\r\nAmerica, and America to Europe, the dealing out of treasury secrets among\r\nhis friends in what time and measure he pleases, and who never slips an\r\noccasion of making friends with his means, that such an one, I say, would\r\nhave brought forward a charge against me for having appointed the poet,\r\nFreneau, translating clerk to my office, with a salary of 250 dollars a\r\nyear. That fact stands thus. While the government was at New York I was\r\napplied to on behalf of Freneau to know if there was any place within my\r\ndepartment to which he could be appointed. I answered there were but four\r\nclerkships, all of which I found full, and continued without any change.\r\nWhen we removed to Philadelphia, Mr. Pintard, the translating clerk,\r\ndid not choose to remove with us. His office then became vacant. I was\r\nagain applied to there for Freneau, and had no hesitation to promise the\r\nclerkship for him. I cannot recollect whether it was at the same time,\r\nor afterwards, that I was told he had a thought of setting up a newspaper\r\nthere. But whether then, or afterwards, I considered it a circumstance of\r\nsome value, as it might enable me to do, what I had long wished to have\r\ndone, that is, to have the material parts of the Leyden Gazette brought\r\nunder your eye, and that of the public, in order to possess yourself and\r\nthem of a juster view of the affairs of Europe than could be obtained from\r\nany other public source. This I had ineffectually attempted through the\r\npress of Mr. Fenno, while in New York, selecting and translating passages\r\nmyself at first, then having it done by Mr. Pintard, the translating\r\nclerk, but they found their way too slowly into Mr. Fenno's papers. Mr.\r\nBache essayed it for me in Philadelphia, but his being a daily paper,\r\ndid not circulate sufficiently in the other States. He even tried, at\r\nmy request, the plan of a weekly paper of recapitulation from his daily\r\npaper, in hopes that that might go into the other States, but in this too\r\nwe failed. Freneau, as translating clerk, and the printer of a periodical\r\npaper likely to circulate through the States (uniting in one person\r\nthe parts of Pintard and Fenno), revived my hopes that the thing could\r\nat length be effected. On the establishment of his paper, therefore, I\r\nfurnished him with the Leyden Gazette, with an expression of my wish\r\nthat he could always translate and publish the material intelligence\r\nthey contained, and have continued to furnish them from time to time, as\r\nregularly as I received them. But as to any other direction or indication\r\nof my wish how his press should be conducted, what sort of intelligence\r\nhe should give, what essays encourage, I can protest, in the presence of\r\nheaven, that I never did by myself, or any other, or indirectly, say a\r\nsyllable, nor attempt any kind of influence. I can further protest, in the\r\nsame awful presence, that I never did, by myself, or any other, directly\r\nor indirectly, write, dictate or procure any one sentence or sentiment\r\nto be inserted _in his, or any other gazette_, to which my name was not\r\naffixed or that of my office. I surely need not except here a thing so\r\nforeign to the present subject as a little paragraph about our Algerine\r\ncaptives, which I put once into Fenno's paper. Freneau's proposition\r\nto publish a paper, having been about the time that the writings of\r\nPublicola, and the discourses on Davila, had a good deal excited the\r\npublic attention, I took for granted from Freneau's character, which\r\nhad been marked as that of a good whig, that he would give free place\r\nto pieces written against the aristocratical and monarchical principles\r\nthese papers had inculcated. This having been in my mind, it is likely\r\nenough I may have expressed it in conversation with others, though I do\r\nnot recollect that I did. To Freneau I think I could not, because I had\r\nstill seen him but once, and that was at a public table, at breakfast, at\r\nMrs. Elsworth's, as I passed through New York the last year. And I can\r\nsafely declare that my expectations looked only to the chastisement of\r\nthe aristocratical and monarchical writers, and not to any criticisms on\r\nthe proceedings of government. Colonel Hamilton can see no motive for any\r\nappointment, but that of making a convenient partizan. But you, Sir, who\r\nhave received from me recommendations of a Rittenhouse, Barlow, Paine,\r\nwill believe that talents and science are sufficient motives with me\r\nin appointments to which they are fitted; and that Freneau, as a man of\r\ngenius, might find a preference in my eye to be a translating clerk, and\r\nmake good title to the little aids I could give him as the editor of a\r\ngazette, by procuring subscriptions to his paper, as I did some before it\r\nappeared, and as I have with pleasure done for the labors of other men of\r\ngenius. I hold it to be one of the distinguishing excellences of elective\r\nover hereditary successions, that the talents which nature has provided\r\nin sufficient proportion, should be selected by the society for the\r\ngovernment of their affairs, rather than that this should be transmitted\r\nthrough the loins of knaves and fools, passing from the debauches of the\r\ntable to those of the bed. Colonel Hamilton, alias \"Plain Facts,\" says,\r\nthat Freneau's salary began before he resided in Philadelphia. I do not\r\nknow what quibble he may have in reserve on the word \"residence.\" He may\r\nmean to include under that idea the removal of his family; for I believe\r\nhe removed himself, before his family did, to Philadelphia. But no act of\r\nmine gave commencement to his salary before he so far took up his abode\r\nin Philadelphia, as to be sufficiently in readiness for the duties of\r\nthe office. As to the merits or demerits of his paper, they certainly\r\nconcern me not. He and Fenno are rivals for the public favor. The one\r\ncourts them by flattery, the other by censure, and I believe it will be\r\nadmitted that the one has been as servile, as the other severe. But is\r\nnot the dignity, and even decency of government committed, when one of its\r\nprincipal ministers enlists himself as an anonymous writer or paragraphist\r\nfor either the one or the other of them? No government ought to be without\r\ncensors; and where the press is free, no one ever will. If virtuous, it\r\nneed not fear the fair operation of attack and defence. Nature has given\r\nto man no other means of sifting out the truth, either in religion, law,\r\nor politics. I think it as honorable to the government neither to know,\r\nnor notice, its sycophants or censors, as it would be undignified and\r\ncriminal to pamper the former and persecute the latter. So much for the\r\npast, a word now of the future.\r\n\r\nWhen I came into this office, it was with a resolution to retire from it\r\nas soon as I could with decency. It pretty early appeared to me that the\r\nproper moment would be the first of those epochs at which the Constitution\r\nseems to have contemplated a periodical change or renewal of the public\r\nservants. In this I was confirmed by your resolution respecting the same\r\nperiod; from which, however, I am happy in hoping you have departed. I\r\nlook to that period with the longing of a wave-worn mariner, who has\r\nat length the land in view, and shall count the days and hours which\r\nstill lie between me and it. In the meanwhile, my main object will be\r\nto wind up the business of my office, avoiding as much as possible all\r\nnew enterprise. With the affairs of the Legislature, as I never did\r\nintermeddle, so I certainly shall not now begin. I am more desirous to\r\npredispose everything for the repose to which I am withdrawing, than\r\nexpose it to be disturbed by newspaper contests. If these however cannot\r\nbe avoided altogether, yet a regard for your quiet will be a sufficient\r\nmotive for my deferring it till I become merely a private citizen, when\r\nthe propriety or impropriety of what I may say or do, may fall on myself\r\nalone. I may then, too, avoid the charge of misapplying that time which\r\nnow, belonging to those who employ me, should be wholly devoted to their\r\nservice. If my own justification, or the interests of the republic shall\r\nrequire it, I reserve to myself the right of then appealing to my country,\r\nsubscribing my name to whatever I write, and using with freedom and truth\r\nthe facts and names necessary to place the cause in its just form before\r\nthat tribunal. To a thorough disregard of the honors and emoluments of\r\noffice, I join as great a value for the esteem of my countrymen, and\r\nconscious of having merited it by an integrity which cannot be reproached,\r\nand by an enthusiastic devotion to their rights and liberty, I will not\r\nsuffer my retirement to be clouded by the slanders of a man whose history,\r\nfrom the moment at which history can stoop to notice him, is a tissue\r\nof machinations against the liberty of the country which has not only\r\nreceived and given him bread, but heaped its honors on his head. Still,\r\nhowever, I repeat the hope that it will not be necessary to make such an\r\nappeal. Though little known to the people of America, I believe, that as\r\nfar as I am known, it is not as an enemy to the Republic, nor an intriguer\r\nagainst it, nor a waster of its revenue, nor prostitutor of it to the\r\npurposes of corruption, as the \"American\" represents me; and I confide\r\nthat yourself are satisfied that as to dissensions in the newspapers,\r\nnot a syllable of them has ever proceeded from me, and that no cabals or\r\nintrigues of mine have produced those in the Legislature, and I hope I\r\nmay promise both to you and myself, that none will receive aliment from me\r\nduring the short space I have to remain in office, which will find ample\r\nemployment in closing the present business of the department.\r\n\r\nObserving that letters written at Mount Vernon on the Monday, and arriving\r\nat Richmond on the Wednesday, reach me on Saturday, I have now the honor\r\nto mention that the 22d instant will be the last of our post days that I\r\nshall be here, and consequently that no letter from you after the 17th,\r\nwill find me here. Soon after that I shall have the honor of receiving at\r\nMount Vernon your orders for Philadelphia, and of there also delivering\r\nyou the little matter which occurs to me as proper for the opening of\r\nCongress, exclusive of what has been recommended in former speeches, and\r\nnot yet acted on. In the meantime and ever I am, with great and sincere\r\naffection and respect, dear Sir your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARCHIBALD STUART, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                             Monticello, September 9, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I wrote you a long letter from Philadelphia early in the\r\nsummer, which would not have been worth recurring to, but that I therein\r\nasked the favor of you to sound Mr. Henry on the subject you had written\r\nto me on, to wit, the amendment of our Constitution, and to find whether\r\nhe would not approve of the specific amendments therein mentioned, in\r\nwhich case the business would be easy. If you have had any conversation\r\nwith him on the subject, I will thank you for the result. As I propose\r\nto return from my present office at the close of the ensuing session of\r\nCongress, and to fix myself once more at home, I begin to feel a more\r\nimmediate interest in having the Constitution of our country fixed, and\r\nin such a form as will ensure a somewhat greater certainty to our laws,\r\nliberty and property, the first and last of which are now pretty much\r\nafloat, and the second not out of the reach of every enterprise. I set\r\nout for Philadelphia about the 20th, and would therefore be happy to hear\r\nfrom you before that. I am, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your\r\nconstant friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CLAY.\r\n\r\n                                            Monticello, September 11, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Your favor of August 8th, came duly to hand, and I should\r\nwith pleasure have done what you therein desired, as I ever should what\r\nwould serve or oblige you; but from a very early moment of my life I\r\ndetermined never to intermeddle with elections of the people, and have\r\ninvariably adhered to this determination. In my own county, where there\r\nhave been so many elections in which my inclinations were enlisted, I yet\r\nnever interfered. I could the less do it in the present instance, your\r\npeople so very distant from me, utterly unknown to me, and to whom I am\r\nalso unknown; and above all, I a stranger, to presume to recommend one\r\nwho is well known to them. The people could not but put this question\r\nto me, \"who are you, pray?\" In writing the letter to you on the former\r\noccasion, I went further than I had ever before done, but that was\r\naddressed to yourself to whom I had a right to write, and not to persons\r\neither unknown to me, or very capable of judging for themselves. I have\r\nso much reliance on your friendship and candor as not to doubt you will\r\napprove of my sentiments on this occasion, and be satisfied they flow from\r\nconsiderations respecting myself only, and not you to whom I am happy in\r\nevery occasion of testifying my esteem. I hope to see you in Bedford about\r\nMay next, and am with great attachment, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD RANDOLPH, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                            Monticello, September 17, 1792.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir,--The last post brought me your favor of the 26th of August;\r\nbut it brought me at the same time so much business to be answered by\r\nreturn of post, and which did not admit of delay, that I was obliged\r\nto postpone the acknowledgment of yours. I thank you sincerely for what\r\nrespects myself. Though I see the pen of the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nplainly in the attack on me, yet, since he has not chosen to put his name\r\nto it, I am not free to notice it as his. I have preserved through life\r\na resolution, set in a very early part of it, never to write in a public\r\npaper without subscribing my name, and to engage openly an adversary\r\nwho does not let himself be seen, is staking all against nothing. The\r\nindecency too, of newspaper squabbling between two public ministers,\r\nbesides my own sense of it, has drawn something like an injunction from\r\nanother quarter. Every fact alleged under the signature of \"an American\"\r\nas to myself, is false, and can be proved so; and perhaps will be one\r\nday. But for the present, lying and scribbling must be free to those mean\r\nenough to deal in them, and in the dark. I should have been setting out\r\nto Philadelphia within a day or two; but the addition of a grandson and\r\nindisposition of my daughter, will probably detain me here a week longer.\r\nMy best respects to Mrs. Randolph, and am, with great and sincere esteem,\r\ndear Sir, your affectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                            Monticello, September 18, 1792--2 o'clock, P.M.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Your express is this moment arrived with the Proclamation\r\non the proceedings against the laws for raising a revenue on distilled\r\nspirits, and I return it herein enclosed with my signature. I think\r\nif, instead of the words \"to render laws dictated by weighty reasons of\r\npublic exigency and policy as acceptable as possible,\" it stood \"to render\r\nthe laws as acceptable as possible,\" it would be better. I see no other\r\nparticular expressions which need alteration. I am sincerely sorry to\r\nlearn that such proceedings have taken place; and I hope the Proclamation\r\nwill lead the persons concerned into a regular line of application which\r\nmay end either in an amendment of the law, if it needs it, or in their\r\nconviction that it is right. Your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO C. C. PINCKNEY, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                             Philadelphia, October 8, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--I found on my return here three days ago, your favor of April\r\n6th, and am happy to learn from it that the Agricultural Society has\r\nadopted the plan of employing a person at Marseilles to raise and send\r\nolive trees to them annually. Their success in South Carolina cannot be\r\ndoubted, and their value is great. Olive grounds in France rent higher\r\nby the acre than those of any other growth in the kingdom, which proves\r\nthey yield the greatest nett produce. Marseilles is the proper place\r\nfor your nurseryman to be fixed, because it is the neighborhood of the\r\nbest olives; and Mr. Cathalan the properest person to whom we can commit\r\nthe whole superintendence, because he is our consul, is concerned in\r\nour commerce, eager to extend it, is a good man, a wealthy one, and has\r\noffered his services repeatedly in this business. He was brought up in\r\na counting-house in London, is connected there, and therefore I think\r\nthat the most convenient place on which to enable him to draw for the\r\nexpenditures. This may be either by an annual letter of credit to him on\r\nsome house there for any sum not exceeding fifty guineas, or a standing\r\nletter of credit for that annual sum till your further orders. I would\r\nadvise that he should never be suffered to be in advance for the society,\r\nthat there may be no motive for his being cool in the business. If you\r\nthink proper to write to Mr. Cathalan merely to open the correspondence\r\nwith him, enclosing him a letter of credit, and referring him to me for\r\nthe mode of conducting the enterprise, I will enclose it to him with\r\nproper instructions as to the mode. My reason for this caution is that\r\nfrom my knowledge of circumstances, and from what has already passed\r\nbetween him and me, I can fix him at once as to a moderate scale of\r\nexpense which I know to be sufficient, and which he might transcend under\r\nthe idea that this is a public enterprise, supported by powerful and\r\nwealthy gentlemen. A copy of my letter shall be sent to you, so that you\r\nmay make any alterations in the plan which may be agreeable to your ideas\r\nof the business, in the course of your future correspondence with Mr.\r\nCathalan; and I shall at all future times be ready to do anything further\r\nin my power to promote the object. I am happy that while I was in the\r\nolive country I enquired for and procured the best book on the subject\r\nof the olive tree, which I now deliver to Mr. Smith for the use of the\r\nsociety. I suspect that the excrescence on your olive trees, described in\r\nyour letter, is what they call the leprosy, which prevails among these\r\nplants I believe in every country. I have the honor to be, with great\r\nrespect and esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, October 12, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Your favor of August the 7th came to hand on the 6th instant,\r\nand gave me the first certain information of your safe arrival. Mr.\r\nOtto being about to sail for London, furnishes me with an opportunity\r\nof sending the newspapers for yourself and Mr. Barclay, and I avail\r\nmyself of it chiefly for this purpose, as my late return from Virginia\r\nand the vacation of Congress furnishes little new and important for your\r\ninformation. With respect to the Indian war, the summer has been chiefly\r\nemployed on our part in endeavoring to persuade them to peace, in an\r\nabstinence from all offensive operations, in order to give those endeavors\r\na fairer chance, and in preparation for activity the ensuing season,\r\nif they fail. I believe we may say these endeavors have all failed, or\r\nprobably will do so. The year has been rather a favorable one for our\r\nagriculture. The crops of small grain were generally good. Early frosts\r\nhave a good deal shortened those of tobacco and Indian corn, yet not so\r\nas to endanger distress. From the south my information is less certain,\r\nbut from that quarter you will be informed through other channels. I have\r\na pleasure in noting this circumstance to you, because the difference\r\nbetween a plentiful and a scanty crop more than counterpoises the expenses\r\nof any campaign. Five or six plentiful years successively, as we have had,\r\nhave most sensibly ameliorated the condition of our country, and uniform\r\nlaws of commerce, introduced by our new government, have enabled us to\r\ndraw the whole benefits of our agriculture.\r\n\r\nI enclose you the copy of a letter from Messrs. Blow and Milhaddo,\r\nmerchants of Virginia, complaining of the taking away of their sailors on\r\nthe coast of Africa, by the commander of a British armed vessel. So many\r\ninstances of this kind have happened, that it is quite necessary that\r\ntheir government should explain themselves on the subject, and be led to\r\ndisavow and punish such conduct. I leave to your discretion to endeavor\r\nto obtain this satisfaction by such friendly discussions as may be most\r\nlikely to produce the desired effect, and secure to our commerce that\r\nprotection against British violence which it has never experienced from\r\nany other nation. No law forbids the seamen of any country to engage in\r\ntime of peace on board a foreign vessel; no law authorizes such seamen\r\nto break his contract, nor the armed vessels of his nation to interpose\r\nforce for his rescue. I shall be happy to hear soon that Mr. B. has gone\r\non the service on which he was ordered.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. CARMICHAEL AND SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, October 14, 1792.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--Since my letters of March the 18th and April the 24th (which\r\nhave been retarded so unfortunately), another subject of conference and\r\nconvention with Spain has occurred. You know that the frontiers of her\r\nprovinces, as well as of our States, are inhabited by Indians holding\r\njustly the right of occupation, and leaving to Spain and to us only\r\nthe claim of excluding other nations from among them, and of becoming\r\nourselves the purchasers of such portions of land, from time to time, as\r\nthey may choose to sell. We have thought, that the dictates of _interest_\r\nas well as _humanity_, enjoined mutual endeavors with those Indians to\r\nlive in peace with both nations, and we have scrupulously observed that\r\nconduct. Our agent with the Indians bordering on the territories of Spain,\r\nhas a standing instruction to use his best endeavors to prevent them from\r\ncommitting acts of hostility against the Spanish settlements. But whatever\r\nmay have been the conduct or orders of the _government_ of Spain, that of\r\ntheir officers in our neighborhood has been indisputably unfriendly and\r\nhostile to us. The papers enclosed will demonstrate this to you. That the\r\nBaron de Carondelet, their chief Governor at New Orleans, has excited the\r\nIndians to war on us, that he has furnished them with abundance of arms\r\nand ammunition, and promised them whatever more shall be necessary, I\r\nhave from the mouth of him who had it from his own mouth. In short, that\r\nhe is the sole source of a great and serious war now burst out upon us,\r\nand from Indians who, we know, were in peaceable dispositions towards us\r\ntill prevailed on by him to commence the war, there remains scarcely room\r\nto doubt. It has become necessary that we understand the real policy of\r\nSpain in this point. You will therefore be pleased to extract from the\r\nenclosed papers such facts as you think proper to be communicated to that\r\ncourt, and enter into friendly but serious expostulations on the conduct\r\nof their officers; for we have equal evidence against the commandants of\r\nother posts in West Florida, though they being subordinate to Carondelet,\r\nwe name him as the source. If they disavow his conduct, we must naturally\r\nlook to their treatment of him as the sole evidence of their sincerity.\r\nBut we must look further. It is a general rule, that no nation has a\r\nright to keep an agent within the limits of another, without the consent\r\nof that other, and we are satisfied it would be best for both Spain\r\nand us, to abstain from having agents or other persons in our employ or\r\npay among the savages inhabiting our respective territories, whether as\r\nsubjects or independent. You are, therefore, desired to propose and press\r\na stipulation to that effect. Should they absolutely decline it, it may be\r\nproper to let them perceive that as the right of keeping agents exists on\r\nboth sides or on neither, it will rest with us to reciprocate their own\r\nmeasures. We confidently hope that these proceedings are unauthorized by\r\nthe government of Spain, and in this hope, we continue in the dispositions\r\nformerly expressed to you, of living on terms of the best friendship and\r\nharmony with that country, of making their interests in our neighborhood\r\nour own, and of giving them every proof of this, except the abandonment\r\nof those essential rights which you are instructed to insist on.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, Gentlemen, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO G. MORRIS, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, October 15, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have duly received your favor of July 10, No. 4, but no other\r\nnumber preceding or subsequent. I fear, therefore, that some miscarriage\r\nhas taken place. The present goes to Bordeaux, under cover to Mr.\r\nFenwick, who, I hope, will be able to give it a safe conveyance to\r\nyou. I observe that you say in your letter, that \"the marine department\r\nis to treat with you for supplies to St. Domingo.\" I presume you mean\r\n\"supplies of _money_,\" and not that our government is to furnish supplies\r\nof _provisions_, specifically, or employ others to do it; this being a\r\nbusiness into which they could not enter. The payment of money here, to\r\nbe employed by their own agents in purchasing the produce of our soil,\r\nis a desirable thing. We are informed by the public papers, that the\r\nlate constitution of France, formally notified to us, is suspended, and\r\na new convention called. During the time of this suspension, and while no\r\nlegitimate government exists, we apprehend we cannot continue the payments\r\nof our debt to France, because there is no person authorized to receive\r\nit and to give us an unobjectionable acquittal. You are, therefore,\r\ndesired to consider the payment as suspended, until further orders. Should\r\ncircumstances oblige you to mention this (which it is better to avoid if\r\nyou can), do it with such solid reasons as will occur to yourself, and\r\naccompany it with the most friendly declarations that the suspension does\r\nnot proceed from any wish in us to delay the payment, the contrary being\r\nour wish, nor from any desire to embarrass or oppose the settlement of\r\ntheir government in that way in which their nation shall desire it; but\r\nfrom our anxiety to pay this debt justly and honorably, and to the persons\r\nreally authorized by the nation (to whom we owe it) to receive it for\r\ntheir use. Nor shall this suspension be continued one moment after we can\r\nsee our way clear out of the difficulty into which their situation has\r\nthrown us. That they may speedily obtain liberty, peace, and tranquillity,\r\nis our sincere prayer.\r\n\r\nThe present summer is employed by us in endeavors to persuade the Indians\r\nto peace, and to prepare for the ensuing campaign, if our endeavors for\r\npeace should fail. That they will fail, we have reason to expect, and\r\nconsequently that the expenses of our armament are to continue for some\r\ntime. Another plentiful year added to the several others which we have\r\nsuccessively had, is some consolation under these expenses. Very early\r\nfrosts, indeed, have somewhat shortened the productions of the autumn.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE TERNANT.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, October 16, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--I am to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant,\r\nproposing a stipulation for the abolition of the practice of privateering\r\nin times of war. The benevolence of this proposition is worthy of the\r\nnation from which it comes, and our sentiments on it have been declared\r\nin the treaty to which you are pleased to refer, as well as in some\r\nothers which have been proposed. There are in those treaties some other\r\nprinciples which would probably meet the approbation of your government,\r\nas flowing from the same desire to lessen the occasions and the calamities\r\nof war. On all of these, as well as on those amendments to our treaty of\r\ncommerce which might better its conditions with both nations, and which\r\nthe National Assembly of France has likewise brought into view on a former\r\noccasion, we are ready to enter into negotiation with you, only proposing\r\nto take the whole into consideration at once. And while contemplating\r\nprovisions which look to the event of war, we are happy in feeling a\r\nconviction that it is yet at a great distance from us, and in believing\r\nthat the sentiments of sincere friendship which we bear to the nation of\r\nFrance are reciprocated on their part. Of these our dispositions, be so\r\ngood as to assure them on this and all other occasions; and to accept\r\nyourself those sentiments of esteem and respect with which I have the\r\nhonor to be, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. VIAR AND JAUDENES, _Commissioners of Spain_.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, November 1, 1792.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--I have now to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of October\r\nthe 29th, which I have duly laid before the President of the United\r\nStates; and in answer thereto, I cannot but observe that some parts of\r\nits contents were truly unexpected. On what foundation it can be supposed\r\nthat we have menaced the Creek nation with destruction during the present\r\nautumn, or at any other time, is entirely inconceivable. Our endeavors,\r\non the contrary, to keep them at peace, have been earnest, persevering\r\nand notorious, and no expense has been spared which might attain that\r\nobject. With the same views to peace, we have suspended, now more than a\r\ntwelvemonth, the marking a boundary between them and us, which had been\r\nfairly, freely and solemnly established with the chiefs whom they had\r\ndeputed to treat with us on that subject; we have suspended it, I say, in\r\nthe constant hope that taking time to consider it in the councils of their\r\nnation, and recognizing the justice and reciprocity of its conditions,\r\nthey would at length freely concur in carrying it into execution. We agree\r\nwith you, that the interests which either of us have in the proceedings of\r\nthe other with this nation of Indians, is a proper subject of discussion\r\nat the negotiations to be opened at Madrid, and shall accordingly give\r\nthe same in charge to our commissioners there. In the meantime, we shall\r\ncontinue sincerely to cultivate the peace and prosperity of all the\r\nparties, being constant in the opinion, that this conduct, reciprocally\r\nobserved, will most increase the happiness of all.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of great esteem and respect,\r\nGentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, November 2, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--The letter of October the 29th, from Messrs. Viar and Jaudenes,\r\nnot expressing the principle on which their government interests itself\r\nbetween the United States and the Creeks, I thought it of importance to\r\nhave it ascertained. I therefore called on those gentlemen, and entered\r\ninto explanations with them. They assured me, in our conversation, that\r\nsupposing all question of boundary to be out of the case, they did not\r\nimagine their government would think themselves authorized to take under\r\ntheir protection, any nations of Indians living within limits confessed to\r\nbe ours; and they presumed that any interference of theirs, with respect\r\nto the Creeks, could only arise out of the question of disputed territory,\r\nnow existing between us; that, on this account, some part of our treaty\r\nwith the Creeks had given dissatisfaction. They said, however, that they\r\nwere speaking from their own sentiments only, having no instructions\r\nwhich would authorize them to declare those of their court; but that\r\nthey expected an answer to their letters covering mine of July the 9th,\r\n(erroneously cited by them as of the 11th,) from which they would probably\r\nknow the sentiments of their court. They accorded entirely in the opinion,\r\nthat it would be better that the two nations should mutually endeavor\r\nto preserve each the peace of the other, as well as their own, with the\r\nneighboring tribes of Indians.\r\n\r\nI shall avail myself of the opportunity by a vessel which is to sail\r\nin a few days, of sending proper information and instructions to our\r\ncommissioners on the subject of the late, as well as of the future,\r\ninterferences of the Spanish officers to our prejudice with the Indians,\r\nand for the establishment of common rules of conduct for the two nations.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect respect and attachment, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. CARMICHAEL AND SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, November 3, 1792.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--I wrote you on the 14th of last month; since which some other\r\nincidents and documents have occurred, bearing relation to the subject of\r\nthat letter. I therefore now enclose you a duplicate of that letter.\r\n\r\nCopy of a letter from the Governor of Georgia, with the deposition it\r\ncovered of a Mr. Hull, and an original passport, signed by Olivier,\r\nwherein he styles himself commissary for his Catholic Majesty with the\r\nCreeks.\r\n\r\nCopy of a letter from Messrs. Viar and Jaudenes to myself, dated October\r\nthe 29th, with that of the extract of a letter of September the 24th, from\r\nthe Baron de Carondelet to them.\r\n\r\nCopy of my answer of No. 1, to them, and copy of a letter from myself to\r\nthe President, stating a conversation with those gentlemen.\r\n\r\nFrom those papers you will find that we have been constantly endeavoring,\r\nby every possible means, to keep peace with the Creeks; that in order\r\nto do this, we have even suspended and still suspend the running a fair\r\nboundary between them and us, as agreed on by themselves, and having for\r\nits object the precise definition of their and our lands, so as to prevent\r\nencroachment on either side, and that we have constantly endeavored to\r\nkeep them at peace with the Spanish settlements also; that Spain on the\r\ncontrary, or at least the officers of her governments, since the arrival\r\nof the Baron de Carondelet, have undertaken to keep an agent among the\r\nCreeks, have excited them and the other southern Indians to commence a war\r\nagainst us, have furnished them with arms and ammunition for the express\r\npurpose of carrying on that war, and prevented the Creeks from running the\r\nboundary which would have removed the cause of difference from between us.\r\nMessrs. Viar and Jaudenes explain the ground of interference on the fact\r\nof the Spanish claim to that territory, and on an article in our treaty\r\nwith the Creeks, putting themselves under our protection. But besides that\r\nyou already know the nullity of their pretended claim to the territory,\r\nthey had themselves set the example of endeavoring to strengthen that\r\nclaim by the treaty mentioned in the letter of the Baron de Carondelet,\r\nand by the employment of an agent among them. The establishment of our\r\nboundary, committed to you, will, of course, remove the grounds of all\r\nfuture pretence to interfere with the Indians _within our territory_, and\r\nit was to such only that the treaty of New York stipulated protection; for\r\nwe take for granted, that Spain will be ready to agree to the principle,\r\nthat neither party has a right to stipulate protection or interference\r\nwith the Indian nations inhabiting the territory of the other. But it is\r\nextremely material also, with sincerity and good faith, to patronize the\r\npeace of each other with the neighboring savages. We are quite disposed to\r\nbelieve that the late wicked excitements to war, have proceeded from the\r\nBaron de Carondelet himself, without any authority from his court. But if\r\nso, have we not reason to expect the removal of such an officer from our\r\nneighborhood, as an evidence of the disavowal of his proceedings? He has\r\nproduced against us a serious war. He says in his letter, indeed, that he\r\nhas suspended it. But this he has not done, nor possibly can he do it. The\r\nIndians are more easily engaged in a war than withdrawn from it. They have\r\nmade the attack in force on our frontiers, whether with or without his\r\nconsent, and will oblige us to a severe punishment of their aggression.\r\nWe trust that you will be able to settle principles of a friendly concert\r\nbetween us and Spain, with respect to the neighboring Indians; and if\r\nnot, that you will endeavor to apprize us of what we may expect, that\r\nwe may no longer be tied up by principles, which, in that case, would be\r\ninconsistent with duty and self-preservation.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of perfect esteem and respect,\r\nGentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, November 3, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--In order to enable you to lay before Congress the account required\r\nby law of the application of the moneys appropriated to foreign purposes\r\nthrough the agency of the Department of State, I have now the honor\r\nto transmit to you the two statements, Nos. 1 and 2, herein enclosed,\r\ncomprehending the period of two years preceding the 1st day of July last.\r\n\r\nThe first statement is of the sums paid from the Treasury under the\r\nact allowing the annual fund of $40,000 for the purpose of foreign\r\nintercourse, as also under the acts of March 3, 1791, c. 16, and May\r\n1792, c. 41, 5, 3, allowing other sums for special purposes. By this\r\nit will appear, that, except the sum of $500 paid to Colonel Humphreys\r\non his departure, the rest has all been received in bills of exchange,\r\nwhich identical bills have been immediately remitted to Europe, either to\r\nthose to whom they were due for services, or to the bankers of the United\r\nStates in Amsterdam, to be paid out by them to persons performing services\r\nabroad. This general view has been given in order to transfer the debt of\r\nthese sums from the Department of State to those to whom they have been\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\nBut in order to give to Congress a view of the specific application\r\nof these moneys, the particular accounts rendered by those who have\r\nreceived them, have been analyzed, and the payments made to them have\r\nbeen reduced under general heads, so as to show at one view the amount of\r\nthe sums which each has received for every distinct species of service or\r\ndisbursement, as well as their several totals. This is the statement No.\r\n2, and it respects the annual fund of $40,000 only, the special funds of\r\nthe acts of 1791 and 1792, having been not yet so far administered as to\r\nadmit of any statement.\r\n\r\nI had presented to the Auditor the statement No. 1, with the vouchers,\r\nand also the special accounts rendered by the several persons who have\r\nreceived these moneys, but, on consideration, he thought himself not\r\nauthorized, by any law, to proceed to their examination. I am, therefore,\r\nto hope, Sir, that authority may be given to the Auditor, or some other\r\nperson, to examine the general account and vouchers of the Department of\r\nState, as well as to raise special accounts against the persons into whose\r\nhands the moneys pass, and to settle the same from time to time on behalf\r\nof the public.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect respect and\r\nattachment, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n              THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE IN ACCOUNT WITH THE U.

you a statement of the administration of the funds appropriated\r\nto certain foreign purposes, together with a letter from the Secretary of\r\nState, explaining the same.\r\n\r\nNovember 5, 1792.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MAYOR, MUNICIPAL OFFICERS AND PROCUREUR OF THE COMMUNITY OF\r\nMARSEILLES.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, November 6, 1792.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--Your letter of the 24th of August, is just now received by\r\nthe President of the United States, and I have it in charge from him to\r\ncommunicate to you the particular satisfaction he feels at the expressions\r\nof fraternity towards our nation therein contained, to assure you that\r\nhe desires sincerely the most speedy relief to France from her general\r\ndifficulties, and will be happy to be instrumental in removing the special\r\nones of the city of Marseilles in particular, by encouraging supplies of\r\nwheat and flour to be sent thither. Our harvest having been plentiful, our\r\nmerchants would of course feel sufficient inducements, in the assurances\r\nyou give of a ready sale and good price, were it not for the apprehensions\r\nof the Barbary cruisers. Certain arrangements for a Convoy, and the time,\r\nplace, and manner of getting under its protection, would remove these\r\napprehensions; but it may be doubtful whether these can be notified to\r\nthem in time to prepare their adventures. They shall certainly, however,\r\nbe informed of the wants of your city, and the inducements to go to\r\nit, and on this, and all other occasions, I beg leave to recommend our\r\ncommerce to the patronage of your municipality, and to tender to you the\r\nhomage of those sentiments of respect and attachment, with which I have\r\nthe honor to be, Gentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, November 6, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--We have never known so long an interval during which there has\r\nnot been a single vessel going to Lisbon. Hence it is that I am so late in\r\nacknowledging the receipt of your letters from No. 54 to 58 inclusive, and\r\nthat I am obliged to do it by the way of London, and consequently cannot\r\nsend you the newspapers as usual.\r\n\r\nThe summer has been chiefly past in endeavoring to bring the north-western\r\nIndians to peace, and in preparing for a vigorous operation against them\r\nthe ensuing summer, if peace should not be made. As yet no symptoms of\r\nit appear on their part. In the meantime there is danger of a war being\r\nkindled up on our south-western frontiers by the Indians in that quarter,\r\nexcited, as we have reason to believe, by some Spanish officers. We trust\r\nthat it has not been with the authority of their government.\r\n\r\nTo counterbalance these evils, we have had the blessing of another\r\nplentiful harvest of the principal grains. Tobacco and Indian corn have\r\nsuffered from the early frosts. We have very earnest demands for supplies\r\nof grain from Marseilles; but the Algerine cruisers are an impediment.\r\nWould it be practicable for you, without awaiting a general treaty, to\r\nobtain permission for our _flour_ to be carried to Portugal? nothing\r\nis more demonstrable than that this restriction is highly injurious to\r\nPortugal as well as to us.\r\n\r\nCongress assembled yesterday, the President will meet them to-day, and\r\nI will enclose you a copy of his speech whereby you will see the chief\r\nobjects which will be under their consideration during the present\r\nsession. Your newspapers shall be sent by the very first vessel bound to\r\nLisbon directly. I am, with sentiments of great and sincere esteem, dear\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. November 7. After writing this letter, your No. 59 came to hand.\r\nIt seems then that, so far from giving new liberties to our corn trade,\r\nPortugal contemplates the prohibition of it, by giving that trade\r\nexclusively to Naples. What would she say should we give her wine-trade\r\nexclusive to France and Spain. It is well known that far the greatest\r\nportion of the wine we consume, is from Portugal and its dependancies,\r\nand it must be foreseen that from the natural increase of population in\r\nthese States, the demand will become equal to the uttermost abilities\r\nof Portugal to supply, even when her last foot of land shall be put into\r\nculture. Can a wise statesman seriously think of risking such a prospect\r\nas this? To me it seems incredible; and if the fact be so, I have no doubt\r\nyou will interpose your opposition with the minister, developing to him\r\nall the consequences which such a measure would have on the happiness of\r\nthe two nations. He should reflect that nothing but habit has produced\r\nin this country a preference of their wines over the superior wines\r\nof France, and that if once that habit is interrupted by an absolute\r\nprohibition it will never be recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, November 7, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--My last to you was of the 15th of October; since which I have\r\nreceived your Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7. Though mine went by a conveyance\r\ndirectly to Bordeaux, and may therefore probably get safe to you, yet I\r\nthink it proper, lest it should miscarry, to repeat to you the following\r\nparagraph from it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am perfectly sensible that your situation must, ere this reaches you,\r\nhave been delicate and difficult; and though the occasion is probably\r\nover, and your part taken of necessity, so that instructions now would be\r\ntoo late, yet I think it just to express our sentiments on the subject,\r\nas a sanction of what you have probably done. Whenever the scene became\r\npersonally dangerous to you, it was proper you should leave it, as well\r\nfrom personal as public motives. But what degree of danger should be\r\nawaited, to what distance or place you should retire, are circumstances\r\nwhich must rest with your own discretion, it being impossible to prescribe\r\nthem from hence. With what kind of government you may do business, is\r\nanother question. It accords with our principles to acknowledge any\r\ngovernment to be rightful, which is formed by the will of the nation\r\nsubstantially declared. The late government was of this kind, and was\r\naccordingly acknowledged by all the branches of ours. So, any alteration\r\nof it which shall be made by the will of the nation substantially\r\ndeclared, will doubtless be acknowledged in like manner. With such a\r\ngovernment _every kind_ of business may be done. But there are _some\r\nmatters_ which, I conceive, might be transacted with a government _de\r\nfacto_; such, for instance, as the reforming the unfriendly restrictions\r\non our commerce and navigation. Such cases you will readily distinguish\r\nas they occur. With respect to this particular reformation of their\r\nregulations, we cannot be too pressing for its attainment, as every day's\r\ncontinuance gives it additional firmness, and endangers its taking root in\r\ntheir habits and constitution; and, indeed, I think they should be told,\r\nas soon as they are in a condition to act, that if they do not revoke\r\nthe late innovations, we must lay additional and equivalent burthens on\r\n_French ships_, by name. Your conduct in the case of M. de Bonne Carrere,\r\nis approved entirely. We think it of great consequence to the friendship\r\nof the two nations, to have a minister here in whose dispositions we have\r\nconfidence. Congress assembled the day before yesterday. I enclose you a\r\npaper containing the President's speech, whereby you will see the chief\r\nobjects of the present session. Your difficulties as to the settlements\r\nof our accounts with France and as to the payment of the foreign officers,\r\nwill have been removed by the letter of the Secretary of the Treasury, of\r\nwhich, for fear it should have miscarried, I now enclose you a duplicate.\r\nShould a conveyance for the present letter offer to any port of France\r\ndirectly, your newspapers will accompany it. Otherwise, I shall send it\r\nthrough Mr. Pinckney, and retain the newspapers as usual, for a direct\r\nconveyance.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, November 8, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--You were not unapprised of the reluctance with which I came\r\ninto my present office, and I came into it with a determination to quit\r\nit as soon as decency would permit. Nor was it long before I fixed on the\r\ntermination of our first federal cycle of four years as the proper moment.\r\nThat moment is now approaching, and is to me as land was to Columbus in\r\nhis first American voyage. The object of this private letter is to desire\r\nthat your future public letters may be addressed to the Secretary of State\r\nby title and not by name, until you know who he will be, as otherwise your\r\nletters arriving here after the 3d of March, would incur the expense,\r\ndelay, and risk of travelling six hundred miles by post after their\r\narrival here. I may perhaps take the liberty of sometimes troubling you\r\nwith a line from my retirement, and shall be ever happy to hear from you,\r\nand to give you every proof of the sincere esteem and respect, with which\r\nI have the honor to be, dear Sir, your affectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. We yesterday received information of the conclusion of peace with\r\nthe Wabash and Illinois Indians. This forms a broad separation between\r\nthe northern and southern war-tribes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. M. RANDOLPH, JR.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, November 16, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Congress have not yet entered into any important business.\r\nAn attempt has been made to give further extent to the influence of the\r\nExecutive over the Legislature, by permitting the heads of departments\r\nto attend the House and explain their measures _vivâ voce_. But it was\r\nnegatived by a majority of 35 to 11, which gives us some hope of the\r\nincrease of the republican vote. However, no trying question enables us\r\nyet to judge, nor indeed is there reason to expect from this Congress many\r\ninstances of conversion, though some will probably have been effected by\r\nthe expression of the public sentiment in the late election. For, as far\r\nas we have heard, the event has been generally in favor of republican,\r\nand against the aristocratical candidates. In this State the election has\r\nbeen triumphantly carried by the republicans; their antagonists having\r\ngot but 2 out of 11 members, and the vote of this State can generally\r\nturn the balance. Freneau's paper is getting into Massachusetts, under\r\nthe patronage of Hancock; and Samuel Adams, and Mr. Ames, the colossus\r\nof the monocrats and paper men, will either be left out or hard run. The\r\npeople of that State are republican; but hitherto they have heard nothing\r\nbut the hymns and lauds chanted by Fenno. My love to my dear Martha, and\r\nam, dear Sir, yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE TERNANT.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, November 20, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--Your letter on the subject of further supplies to the colony of St.\r\nDomingo, has been duly received and considered. When the distresses of\r\nthat colony first broke forth, we thought we could not better evidence\r\nour friendship to that and to the mother country also, than to step in to\r\nits relief, on your application, without waiting a formal authorization\r\nfrom the National Assembly. As the case was unforeseen, so it was\r\nunprovided for on their part, and we did what we doubted not they would\r\nhave desired us to do, had there been time to make the application, and\r\nwhat we presumed they would sanction as soon as known to them. We have\r\nnow been going on more than a twelve-month, in making advances for the\r\nrelief of the colony, without having, as yet, received any such sanction;\r\nfor the decree of four millions of livres in aid of the colony, besides\r\nthe circuitous and informal manner by which we became acquainted with it,\r\ndescribes and applies to operations very different from those which have\r\nactually taken place. The wants of the colony appear likely to continue,\r\nand their reliance on our supplies to become habitual. We feel every\r\ndisposition to continue our efforts for administering to those wants;\r\nbut that cautious attention to forms which would have been unfriendly in\r\nthe first moment, becomes a duty to ourselves, when the business assumes\r\nthe appearance of long continuance, and respectful also to the National\r\nAssembly itself, who have a right to prescribe the line of an interference\r\nso materially interesting to the mother country and the colony.\r\n\r\nBy the estimate you were pleased to deliver me, we perceive that there\r\nwill be wanting, to carry the colony through the month of December,\r\nbetween thirty and forty thousand dollars, in addition to the sums\r\nbefore engaged to you. I am authorized to inform you, that the sum of\r\nforty thousand dollars shall be paid to your orders at the treasury of\r\nthe United States, and to assure you, that we feel no abatement in our\r\ndispositions to contribute these aids from time to time, as they shall\r\nbe wanting, for the necessary subsistence of the colony; but the want of\r\nexpress approbation from the national Legislature, must ere long produce\r\na presumption that they contemplate perhaps other modes of relieving the\r\ncolony, and dictate to us the propriety of doing only what they shall\r\nhave regularly and previously sanctioned. Their decree before mentioned,\r\ncontemplates purchases made _in the United States only_. In this they\r\nmight probably have in view, as well to keep the business of providing\r\nsupplies under a single direction, as that these supplies should be bought\r\nwhere they can be had cheapest, and where the same sum will consequently\r\neffect the greatest measure of relief to the colony. It is our wish\r\nas undoubtedly it must be yours, that the moneys we furnish be applied\r\nstrictly in the line they prescribe. We understand, however, that there\r\nare in the hands of our citizens, some bills drawn by the administration\r\nof the colony, for articles of subsistence _delivered there_. It seems\r\njust, that such of them should be paid as were received before _bona fide_\r\nnotice that that mode of supply was not bottomed on the funds furnished\r\nto you by the United States, and we recommend them to you accordingly.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect. Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, December 3, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI do not write you a public letter by the packet because there is really\r\nno subject for it. The elections for Congress have produced a decided\r\nmajority in favor of the republican interest. They complain, you know,\r\nthat the influence and patronage of the Executive is to become so great as\r\nto govern the Legislature. They endeavored a few days ago to take away one\r\nmeans of influence by condemning references to the heads of department.\r\nThey failed by a majority of five votes. They were more successful in\r\ntheir endeavor to prevent the introduction of a new means of influence,\r\nthat of admitting the heads of department to deliberate occasionally in\r\nthe House in explanation of their measures. The proposition for their\r\nadmission was rejected by a pretty general vote. I think we may consider\r\nthe tide of this government as now at the fullest, and that it will, from\r\nthe commencement of the next session of Congress, retire and subside into\r\nthe true principles of the Constitution. An alarm has been endeavored to\r\nbe sounded as if the republican interest was indisposed to the payment\r\nof the public debt. Besides the general object of the calumny, it was\r\nmeant to answer the special one of electioneering. Its falsehood was\r\nso notorious that it produced little effect. They endeavored with as\r\nlittle success to conjure up the ghost of anti-federalism, and to have\r\nit believed that this and republicanism were the same, and that both were\r\nJacobinism. But those who felt themselves republicans and federalists too,\r\nwere little moved by this artifice; so that the result of the election\r\nhas been promising. The occasion of electing a Vice-President has been\r\nseized as a proper one for expressing the public sense on the doctrines\r\nof the monocrats. There will be a strong vote against Mr. Adams, but the\r\nstrength of his personal worth and his services will, I think, prevail\r\nover the demerit of his political creed.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, my dear Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. GILMER.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, December 15, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Doctor,--I received only two days ago your favor of October 9, by Mr.\r\nEverett. He is now under the small-pox. I am rejoiced with the account\r\nhe gives me of the invigoration of your system, and am anxious for your\r\npersevering in any course of regimen which may long preserve you to us. We\r\nhave just received the glorious news of the Prussian army being obliged\r\nto retreat, and hope it will be followed by some proper catastrophe on\r\nthem. This news has given wry faces to our monocrats here, but sincere\r\njoy to the great body of the citizens. It arrived only in the afternoon\r\nof yesterday, and the bells were rung and some illuminations took place in\r\nthe evening. A proposition has been made to Congress to begin sinking the\r\npublic debt by a tax on pleasure horses; that is to say, on all horses not\r\nemployed for the draught or farm. It is said there is not a horse of that\r\ndescription eastward of New York. And as to call this a _direct tax_ would\r\noblige them to proportion it among the States according to the census,\r\nthey choose to class it among the _indirect taxes_. We have a glimmering\r\nhope of peace from the northern Indians, but from those of the south there\r\nis danger of war. Wheat is at a dollar and a fifth here. Do not sell yours\r\ntill the market begins to fall. You may lose a penny or two in the bushel\r\nthen, but might lose a shilling or two now. Present me affectionately to\r\nMrs. Gilmer. Yours, sincerely.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MERCER.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, December 19, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I received yesterday your favor of the 13th. I had been\r\nwaiting two or three days in expectation of vessels said to be in the\r\nriver, and by which we hope more particular accounts of the late affairs\r\nin France. It has turned out that there were no such vessels arriving as\r\nhad been pretended. However I think we may safely rely that the Duke of\r\nBrunswick has retreated, and it is certainly possible enough that between\r\nfamine, disease, and a country abounding with defiles, he may suffer some\r\nconsiderable catastrophe. The monocrats here still affect to disbelieve\r\nall this, while the republicans are rejoicing and taking to themselves the\r\nname of Jacobins, which two months ago was fixed on them by way of stigma.\r\nThe votes for Vice-President, as far as hitherto known, stands thus:\r\n\r\n                   Adams. Clinton.\r\n\r\n  New Hampshire      6\r\n  Massachusetts     16\r\n  Rhode Island       4\r\n  Connecticut        7\r\n  New York                  12\r\n  Pennsylvania      14       1\r\n  Delaware           3\r\n  Maryland           8\r\n  Virginia                  21\r\n\r\nBankrupt bill is brought on with some very threatening features to landed\r\nand farming men, who are in danger of being drawn into its vortex. It\r\nassumes the right of seizing and selling lands, and so cuts the knotty\r\nquestion of the Constitution whether the General Government may direct\r\nthe transmission of land by descent or otherwise. The post-office is not\r\nwithin my department, but that of the treasury. I note duly what you say\r\nof Mr. Skinner, but I don't believe any bill on weights and measures will\r\nbe passed. Adieu. Yours, affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. RUTHERFORD.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, December 25, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have considered, with all the attention which the shortness of\r\nthe time would permit, the two motions which you were pleased to put into\r\nmy hands yesterday afternoon, on the subject of weights and measures, now\r\nunder reference to a committee of the Senate, and will take the liberty\r\nof making a few observations thereon.\r\n\r\nThe first, I presume, is intended as a basis for the adoption of that\r\nalternative of the report on measures and weights, which proposed\r\nretaining the present system, and fixing its several parts by a reference\r\nto a rod vibrating seconds, under the circumstances therein explained;\r\nand to fulfil its object, I think the resolutions there proposed should be\r\nfollowed by this: \"that the standard by which the said measures of length,\r\nsurface, and capacity shall be fixed, shall be an uniform cylindrical rod\r\nof iron, of such length as in latitude forty-five degrees, in the level of\r\nthe ocean, and in a cellar or other place of uniform natural temperature,\r\nshall perform its vibrations in small and equal arcs, in one second of\r\nmean time; and that rain water be the substance, to some definite mass of\r\nwhich, the said weights shall be referred.\" Without this, the committee\r\nemployed to prepare a bill on those resolutions, would be uninstructed\r\nas to the principles by which the Senate mean to fix their measures of\r\nlength, and the substance by which they will fix their weights.\r\n\r\nThe second motion is a middle proposition between the first and the\r\nlast alternatives in the report. It agrees with the first in some of\r\nthe present measures and weights, and with the last, in compounding\r\nand dividing them decimally. If this should be thought best, I take the\r\nliberty of proposing the following alterations of these resolutions:\r\n\r\n2d. For \"metal\" substitute \"iron.\" The object is to have one determinate\r\nstandard. But the different metals having different degrees of\r\nexpansibility, there would be as many different standards as there\r\nare metals, were that generic term to be used. A specific one seems\r\npreferable, and \"iron\" the best, because the least variable by expansion.\r\n\r\n3d. I should think it better to omit the chain of 66 feet, because it\r\nintroduces a series which is not decimal, viz., 1. 66. 80. and because\r\nit is absolutely useless. As a measure of length, it is unknown to the\r\nmass of our citizens; and if retained for the purpose of superficial\r\nmeasure, the foot will supply its place, and fix the acre as in the fourth\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\n4th. For the same reason, I propose to omit the words \"or shall be ten\r\nchains in length and one in breadth.\"\r\n\r\n5th. This resolution would stand better, if it omitted the words \"shall\r\nbe one foot square, and one foot and twenty cents of a foot deep,\r\nand,\" because the second description is perfect, and too plain to need\r\nexplanation. Or if the first expression be preferred, the second may be\r\nomitted, as perfectly tautologous.\r\n\r\n6th. I propose to leave out the words \"shall be equal to the pound\r\navoirdupois now in use, and,\" for the reasons suggested in the second\r\nresolution, to wit, that our object is, to have one determinate standard.\r\nThe pound avoirdupois now in use is an indefinite thing. The committee\r\nof parliament reported variations among the standard weights of the\r\nexchequer. Different persons weighing the cubic foot of water, have\r\nmade it, some more, and some less than one thousand ounces avoirdupois;\r\naccording as their weights had been tested by the lighter or heavier\r\nstandard weights of the exchequer. If the pound now in use be declared a\r\nstandard, as well as the weight of sixteen thousand cubic cents of a foot\r\nin water, it may hereafter perhaps be insisted that these two definitions\r\nare different, and that, being of equal authority, either may be used,\r\nand so the standard pound be rendered as uncertain as at present.\r\n\r\n7th. For the same reason, I propose to omit the words \"equal to seven\r\ngrains troy.\" The true ratio between the avoirdupois and troy weights,\r\nis a very contested one. The equation of seven thousand grains troy to\r\nthe pound avoirdupois, is only one of several opinions, and is indebted\r\nperhaps to its integral form for its prevalence. The introduction either\r\nof the troy or avoirdupois weight into the definition of our unit, will\r\nthrow that unit under the uncertainties now enveloping the troy and\r\navoirdupois weights.\r\n\r\nWhen the House of Representatives were pleased to refer to me the subject\r\nof weights and measures, I was uninformed as to the hypothesis on which I\r\nwas to take it up; to wit, whether on that, that our citizens would not\r\napprove of any material change in the present system, or on the other,\r\nthat they were ripe for a complete reformation. I therefore proposed\r\nplans for each alternative. In contemplating these, I had occasion to\r\nexamine well all the middle ground between the two, and among others\r\nwhich presented themselves to my mind, was the plan of establishing one\r\nof the known weights and measures as the unit in each class; to wit, in\r\nthe measures of lines, of surfaces, and of solids, and in weights, and\r\nto compound and divide them decimally. In the measures of weights, I had\r\nthought of the ounce as the best unit, because, calling it the thousandth\r\npart of a cubic foot of water, it fell into the decimal series, formed a\r\nhappy link of connection with the system of measures on the one side, and\r\nof coins on the other, by admitting an equality with the dollar, without\r\nchanging the value of that or its alloy materially. But on the whole, I\r\nabandoned this middle proposition, on the supposition that if our fellow\r\ncitizens were ripe for advancing so great a length towards reformation,\r\nas to retain only four known points of the very numerous series to which\r\nthey were habituated, to wit, the foot, the acre, the bushel, and the\r\nounce, abandoning all the multiples and subdivisions of them, or recurring\r\nfor their value to the tables which would be formed, they would probably\r\nbe ripe for taking the whole step, giving up these four points also, and\r\nmaking the reformation complete; and the rather, as in the present series\r\nand the one to be proposed, there would be so many points of very near\r\napproximation, as aided in the same manner by tables, would not increase\r\ntheir difficulties perhaps, indeed, would lessen them by the greater\r\nsimplicity of the links by which the several members of the system are\r\nconnected together. Perhaps, however, I was wrong in this supposition. The\r\nrepresentatives of the people in Congress are alone competent to judge\r\nof the general disposition of the people, and to what precise point of\r\nreformation they are ready to go. On this, therefore, I do not presume to\r\ngive an opinion, nor to pronounce between the comparative expediency of\r\nthe three propositions; but shall be ready to give whatever aid I can to\r\nany of them which shall be adopted by the Legislature.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with perfect respect, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, December 30, 1792.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--My last letters to you have been of the 13th and 20th of\r\nNovember, since which I have received yours of September 19. We are\r\nanxious to hear that the person substituted in the place of the one\r\ndeceased is gone on that business. You do not mention your prospect of\r\nfinding for the mint the officers we were desirous of procuring. On this\r\nsubject, I will add to what was before mentioned to you, that if you can\r\nget artists _really eminent_, and on the _salaries fixed by the law_, we\r\nshall be glad of them; but that experience of the persons we have found\r\nhere, would induce us to be contented with them rather than to take those\r\nwho are _not eminent_, or who would expect _more than the legal salaries_.\r\nA greater difficulty has been experienced in procuring copper for the\r\nmint than we expected. Mr. Rittenhouse, the Director, having been advised\r\nthat it might be had on advantageous terms from Sweden, has written me a\r\nletter on that subject, a copy of which I enclose you, with the bill of\r\nexchange it covered. I should not have troubled you with them, had our\r\nresident in Holland been in place. But on account of his absence, I am\r\nobliged to ask the favor of you to take such measures as your situation\r\nwill admit, for procuring such a quantity of copper, to be brought us from\r\nSweden, as this bill will enable you. It is presumed that the commercial\r\nrelations of London with every part of Europe will furnish ready means\r\nof executing this commission. We as yet get no answer from Mr. Hammond\r\non the general subject of the execution of the treaty. He says he is\r\nwaiting for instructions. It would be well to urge, in your conversations\r\nwith the minister, the necessity of giving Mr. Hammond such instructions\r\nand latitude as will enable him to proceed of himself. If on every move\r\nwe are to await new instructions from the other side the Atlantic, it\r\nwill be a long business indeed. You express a wish in your letter to be\r\ngenerally advised as to the tenor of your conduct, in consequence of the\r\nlate revolution in France, the questions relative to which, you observe,\r\nincidentally present themselves to you. It is impossible to foresee\r\nthe particular circumstances which may require you to decide and act on\r\nthat question. But, principles being understood, their application will\r\nbe less embarrassing. We certainly cannot deny to other nations that\r\nprinciple whereon our government is founded, that every nation has a right\r\nto govern itself internally under what forms it pleases, and to change\r\nthese forms at its own will; and externally to transact business with\r\nother nations through whatever organ it chooses, whether that be a King,\r\nConvention, Assembly, Committee, President, or whatever it be. The only\r\nthing essential is, the will of the nation. Taking this as your polar\r\nstar, you can hardly err. I shall send you by the first vessel which sails\r\n(the packet excepted on account of postage) two dozen plans of the city of\r\nWashington in the Federal Government, which you are desired to display,\r\nnot for sale, but for public inspection, wherever they may be most seen\r\nby those descriptions of people worthy and likely to be attracted to it,\r\ndividing the plans among the cities of London and Edinburgh chiefly, but\r\nsending some also to Glasgow, Bristol, Dublin, &c. Mr. Taylor tells me he\r\nsends you the public papers by every vessel going from hence to London.\r\nThey will keep you informed of the proceedings of Congress, and other\r\noccurrences worthy your knowledge. I have the honor to be, with great and\r\nsincere esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. Though I have mentioned Sweden as the _most likely_ place to get\r\ncopper from, on the best terms, yet if you can be satisfied it may be\r\ngot on better terms elsewhere, it is left to your discretion to get it\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                             Philadelphia, January 3, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--My last private letter to you was of October 16, since which\r\nI have received your Nos. 103, 107, 108, 109, 110, 112, 113 and 114 and\r\nyesterday your private one of September 15, came to hand. The tone of\r\nyour letters had for some time given me pain, on account of the extreme\r\nwarmth with which they censured the proceedings of the Jacobins of France.\r\nI considered that sect as the same with the Republican patriots, and the\r\nFeuillants as the Monarchical patriots, well known in the early part\r\nof the Revolution, and but little distant in their views, both having\r\nin object the establishment of a free constitution, differing only on\r\nthe question whether their chief Executive should be hereditary or not.\r\nThe Jacobins (as since called) yielded to the Feuillants, and tried\r\nthe experiment of retaining their hereditary Executive. The experiment\r\nfailed completely, and would have brought on the re-establishment of\r\ndespotism had it been pursued. The Jacobins knew this, and that the\r\nexpunging that office was of absolute necessity. And the nation was\r\nwith them in opinion, for however they might have been formerly for\r\nthe constitution framed by the first assembly, they were come over from\r\ntheir hope in it, and were now generally Jacobins. In the struggle which\r\nwas necessary, many guilty persons fell without the forms of trial,\r\nand with them some innocent. These I deplore as much as any body, and\r\nshall deplore some of them to the day of my death. But I deplore them\r\nas I should have done had they fallen in battle. It was necessary to\r\nuse the arm of the people, a machine not quite so blind as balls and\r\nbombs, but blind to a certain degree. A few of their cordial friends\r\nmet at their hands the fate of enemies. But time and truth will rescue\r\nand embalm their memories, while their posterity will be enjoying that\r\nvery liberty for which they would never have hesitated to offer up their\r\nlives. The liberty of the whole earth was depending on the issue of the\r\ncontest, and was ever such a prize won with so little innocent blood? My\r\nown affections have been deeply wounded by some of the martyrs to this\r\ncause, but rather than it should have failed I would have seen half the\r\nearth desolated; were there but an Adam and an Eve left in every country,\r\nand left free, it would be better than as it now is. I have expressed\r\nto you my sentiments, because they are really those of ninety-nine in\r\nan hundred of our citizens. The universal feasts, and rejoicings which\r\nhave lately been had on account of the successes of the French, showed\r\nthe genuine effusions of their hearts. You have been wounded by the\r\nsufferings of your friends, and have by this circumstance been hurried\r\ninto a temper of mind which would be extremely disrelished if known to\r\nyour countrymen. The rescue of 224.68.1460.916.83. had never permitted me\r\nto discover the light in which he viewed it, and as I was more anxious\r\nthat you should satisfy him than me, I had still avoided explanations\r\nwith you on the subject. But your 113. induced him to break silence, and\r\nto notice the extreme acrimony of your expressions. He added that he had\r\nbeen informed the sentiments you expressed _in your conversations_ were\r\nequally offensive to our allies, and that you should consider yourself\r\nas the representative of your country, and that what you say might be\r\nimputed to your constituents. He desired me therefore to write to you\r\non this subject. He added that he considered 729.633.224.939.1243.\r\n1210.741.1683.1460.216.1407.890.1416.1212.674.125.633.1450. 1559.182.\r\nthere are in the United States some characters of opposite principles;\r\nsome of them are high in office, others possessing great wealth, and all\r\nof them hostile to France, and fondly looking to England as the staff of\r\ntheir hope. These I named to you on a former occasion. Their prospects\r\nhave certainly not brightened. Excepting them, this country is entirely\r\nrepublican, friends to the Constitution, anxious to preserve it, and\r\nto have it administered according to its own republican principles. The\r\nlittle party above mentioned have espoused it only as a stepping-stone\r\nto monarchy, and have endeavored to approximate it to that in its\r\nadministration in order to render its final transition more easy. The\r\nsuccesses of republicanism in France have given the coup de grace to\r\ntheir prospects, and I hope to their projects. I have developed to you\r\nfaithfully the sentiments of your country, that you may govern yourself\r\naccordingly. I know your republicanism to be pure, and that it is no\r\ndecay of that which has embittered you against its votaries in France,\r\nbut too great a sensibility at the partial evil which its object has\r\nbeen accomplished there. I have written to you in the style to which\r\nI have been always accustomed with you, and which perhaps it is time\r\nI should lay aside. But while old men are sensible enough of their own\r\nadvance in years, they do not sufficiently recollect it in those whom\r\nthey have seen young. In writing, too, the last private letter which\r\nwill probably be written under present circumstances, in contemplating\r\nthat your correspondence will shortly be turned over to I know not whom,\r\nbut certainly to some one not in the habit of considering your interests\r\nwith the same fostering anxieties I do, I have presented things without\r\nreserve, satisfied you will ascribe what I have said to its true motive,\r\nuse it for your own best interest, and in that fulfil completely what I\r\nhad in view. With respect to the subject of your letter of Sept. 15, you\r\nwill be sensible that many considerations would prevent my undertaking\r\nthe reformation of a system with which I am so soon to take leave. It\r\nis but common decency to leave to my successor the moulding of his own\r\nbusiness. Not knowing how otherwise to convey this letter to you with\r\ncertainty, I shall appeal to the friendship and honor of the Spanish\r\ncommissioners here, to give it the protection of their cover, as a letter\r\nof private nature altogether. We have no remarkable event here lately but\r\nthe death of Dr. Lee, nor have I anything new to communicate to you of\r\nyour friends or affairs. I am, with unalterable affection and wishes for\r\nyour prosperity, my dear Sir, your sincere friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n                                             Philadelphia, January 7, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Our news from France continues to be good, and to promise\r\na continuance; the event of the revolution there is now little doubted\r\nof, even by its enemies, the sensations it has produced here, and the\r\nindications of them in the public papers, have shown that the form our\r\nown government was to take depended much more on the events of France\r\nthan anybody had before imagined. The tide which after our former relaxed\r\ngovernment, took a violent course towards the opposite extreme, and seemed\r\nready to hang everything round with the tassels and baubles of monarchy,\r\nis now getting track as we hope to a just mean, a government of laws\r\naddressed to the reason of the people and not to their weaknesses. The\r\ndaily papers show it more than those you receive. An attempt in the House\r\nof Representatives to stop the recruiting service has been rejected.\r\nIndeed, the conferences for peace, agreed to by the Indians, do not\r\npromise much, as we have reason to believe they will insist on taking back\r\nlands purchased at former treaties. Maria is well; we hope all are so at\r\nMonticello. My best love to my dear Martha, and am, most affectionately,\r\ndear Sir, yours, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, January 25, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--Mr. Segaux called on me this morning to ask a statement of the\r\nexperiment which was made in Virginia by a Mr. Mazzie, for the raising\r\nvines and making wines, and desired I would address it to you. Mr.\r\nMazzie was an Italian, and brought over with him about a dozen laborers\r\nof his own country, bound to serve him four or five years. We made up a\r\nsubscription for him of £2,000 sterling, and he began his experiment on a\r\npiece of land adjoining to mine. His intention was, before the time of his\r\npeople should expire, to import more from Italy. He planted a considerable\r\nvineyard, and attended to it with great diligence for three years. The war\r\nthen came on, the time of his people soon expired, some of them enlisted,\r\nothers chose to settle on other lands and labor for themselves; some were\r\ntaken away by the gentlemen of the country for gardeners, so that there\r\ndid not remain a single one with him, and the interruption of navigation\r\nprevented his importing others. In this state of things he was himself\r\nemployed by the State of Virginia to go to Europe as their agent to do\r\nsome particular business. He rented his place to General Riedesel, whose\r\nhorses in one week destroyed the whole labor of three or four years; and\r\nthus ended an experiment which, from every appearance, would in a year\r\nor two more have established the practicability of that branch of culture\r\nin America. This is the sum of the experiment as exactly as I am able to\r\nstate it from memory, after such an interval of time, and I consign it to\r\nyou in whose hands I know it will be applied with candor, if it contains\r\nanything applicable to the case for which it has been asked.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem and respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, January 26, 1793.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Martha,--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have for some time past been under an agitation of mind which I\r\nscarcely ever experienced before, produced by a check on my purpose of\r\nreturning home at the close of this session of Congress. My operations\r\nat Monticello had been all made to bear upon that point of time, my mind\r\nwas fixed on it with a fondness which was extreme, the purpose firmly\r\ndeclared to the President, when I became assailed from all quarters with a\r\nvariety of objections. Among these it was urged that my return just when\r\nI had been attacked in the public papers, would injure me in the eyes\r\nof the public, who would suppose I either withdrew from investigation,\r\nor because I had not tone of mind sufficient to meet slander. The only\r\nreward I ever wished on my retirement was to carry with me nothing like a\r\ndisapprobation of the public. These representations have, for some weeks\r\npast, shaken a determination which I had thought the whole world could\r\nnot have shaken. I have not yet finally made up my mind on the subject,\r\nnor changed my declaration to the President. But having perfect reliance\r\nin the disinterested friendship of some of those who have counseled\r\nand urged it strongly; believing that they can see and judge better a\r\nquestion between the public and myself than I can, I feel a possibility\r\nthat I may be detained here into the summer. A few days will decide. In\r\nthe meantime I have permitted my house to be rented after the middle of\r\nMarch, have sold such of my furniture as would not suit Monticello, and\r\nam packing up the rest and storing it ready to be shipped off to Richmond\r\nas soon as the season of good sea weather comes on. A circumstance which\r\nweighs on me next to the weightiest is the trouble which, I foresee,\r\nI shall be constrained to ask Mr. Randolph to undertake. Having taken\r\nfrom other pursuits a number of hands to execute several purposes which\r\nI had in view this year, I cannot abandon those purposes and lose their\r\nlabor altogether. I must, therefore, select the most important and least\r\ntroublesome of them, the execution of my canal, and (without embarrassing\r\nhim with any details which Clarkson and George are equal to) get him\r\nto tell them always what is to be done and how, and to attend to the\r\nlevelling the bottom; but on this I shall write him particularly if I\r\ndefer my departure. I have not received the letter which Mr. Carr wrote to\r\nme from Richmond, nor any other from him since I left Monticello. My best\r\naffections to him, Mr. Randolph and your fireside, and am, with sincere\r\nlove, my dear Martha, yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. STEWART, OR TO ALL THE GENTLEMEN.\r\n\r\n                                                          January 31, 1793.\r\n\r\nI have had under consideration Mr. Hallet's plans for the capitol, which\r\nundoubtedly have a great deal of merit. Doctor Thornton has also given\r\nme a view of his. These last came forward under some very advantageous\r\ncircumstances. The grandeur, simplicity and beauty of the exterior, the\r\npropriety with which the apartments are distributed, and economy in the\r\nmass of the whole structure, will, I doubt not, give it a preference in\r\nyour eyes, as it has done in mine and those of several others whom I have\r\nconsulted. I have, therefore, thought it better to give the Doctor time\r\nto finish his plan, and for this purpose to delay until your next meeting\r\na final decision. Some difficulty arises with respect to Mr. Hallet, who\r\nyou know was in some degree led into his plan by ideas we all expressed to\r\nhim. This ought not to induce us to prefer it to a better; but while he\r\nis liberally rewarded for the time and labor he has expended on it, his\r\nfeelings should be saved and soothed as much as possible. I leave it to\r\nyourselves how best to prepare him for the possibility that the Doctor's\r\nplan may be preferred to his. Some ground for this will be furnished you\r\nby the occasion you will have for recourse to him as to the interior of\r\nthe apartments, and the taking of him into service at a fixed allowance;\r\nand I understand that his necessities render it material that he should\r\nknow what his allowance is to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CARROLL.\r\n\r\n                                            Philadelphia, February 1, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Doctor Thornton's plan of a capitol has been produced, and has\r\nso captivated the eyes and judgment of all as to leave no doubt you will\r\nprefer it when it shall be exhibited to you; as no doubt exists here of\r\nits preference over all which have been produced, and among its admirers\r\nno one is more decided than him whose decision is most important. It is\r\nsimple, noble, beautiful, excellently distributed, and moderate in size.\r\nThe purpose of this letter is to apprize you of this sentiment. A just\r\nrespect for the right of approbation in the commissioners will prevent\r\nany formal decision in the President till the plan shall be laid before\r\nyou and be approved by you. The Doctor will go with it to your meeting in\r\nthe beginning of March. In the meantime, the interval of _apparent_ doubt\r\nmay be improved for settling the mind of poor Hallet, whose merit and\r\ndistresses interest every one for his tranquillity and pecuniary relief.\r\nI have taken the liberty of making these private estimates, thinking you\r\nwould wish to know the true state of the sentiments here on this subject,\r\nand am with sincere respect and esteem for your colleagues and yourself,\r\ndear Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Circular to the ministers of France, the United Netherlands, Great\r\nBritain, &c._\r\n                                           Philadelphia, February 13, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--The House of Representatives having referred to me, to report to\r\nthem the nature and extent of the privileges and restrictions on the\r\ncommerce of the United States with foreign nations, I have accordingly\r\nprepared a report on that subject. Being particularly anxious that it\r\nmay be exact in matters of fact, I take the liberty of putting into\r\nyour hands, _privately and informally_, an extract of such as relate to\r\nour commerce with your nation, in hopes that if you can either enlarge\r\nor correct them, you will do me that favor. It is safer to suppress an\r\nerror in its first conception, than to trust to any after-correction; and\r\na confidence in your sincere desire to communicate or to re-establish\r\nany truths which may contribute to a perfect understanding between our\r\ntwo nations, has induced me to make the present request. I wish it had\r\nbeen in my power to have done this sooner, and thereby have obtained the\r\nbenefit of your having more time to contemplate it; but circumstances\r\nhave retarded the entire completion of the report till the Congress is\r\napproaching its end, which will oblige me to give it in within three or\r\nfour days.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. The report having been prepared before the late diminution of the\r\nduties on our tobacco, that circumstance will be noted in the letter which\r\nwill cover that report.\r\n\r\n_France_ receives favorably our bread stuff, rice, wood, pot and pearl\r\nashes.\r\n\r\nA duty of five sous the quintal, or nearly four and a half cents, is\r\npaid on our tar, pitch and turpentine. Our whale oils pay six livres the\r\nquintal, and are the only whale oils admitted. Our indigo pays five livres\r\nthe quintal, their own two and a half; but a difference of quality, still\r\nmore than a difference of duty, prevents its seeking that market.\r\n\r\nSalted beef is received freely for re-exportation; but if for home\r\nconsumption, it pays five livres the quintal. Other salted provisions\r\npay that duty in all cases, and salted fish is made lately to pay the\r\nprohibitory one, of twenty livres the quintal.\r\n\r\nOur ships are free to carry thither all foreign goods, which may be\r\ncarried in their own or any other vessels, except tobaccos not of our own\r\ngrowth; and they participate with theirs, the exclusive carriage of our\r\nwhale oils.\r\n\r\nDuring their former government, our tobacco was under a monopoly, but paid\r\nno duties; and our ships were freely sold in their ports and converted\r\ninto national bottoms. The first National Assembly took from our ships\r\nthis privilege. They emancipated tobacco from its monopoly, but subjected\r\nit to duties of eighteen livres fifteen sous the quintal, carried in their\r\nown vessels, and twenty five livres, carried in ours; a difference more\r\nthan equal to the freight of the article.\r\n\r\nThey and their colonies consume what they receive from us.\r\n\r\nFrance, by a standing law, permits her West India possessions to receive\r\ndirectly our vegetables, live provisions, horses, wood, tar, pitch,\r\nand turpentine, rice and maize, and prohibits our other bread stuff;\r\nbut a suspension of this prohibition having been left to the colonial\r\nlegislature, in times of scarcity, it was formerly suspended occasionally,\r\nbut latterly without interruption.\r\n\r\nOur fish and salted provisions (except pork) are received in their\r\nislands, under a duty of three colonial livres the quintal, and our\r\nvessels are as free as their own to carry our commodities thither, and to\r\nbring away rum and molasses.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _United Netherlands_ prohibit our pickled beef and pork, meals, and\r\nbread of all sorts, and lay a prohibitory duty on spirits distilled from\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nAll other of our productions are received on varied duties, which may be\r\nreckoned, on a medium, at about three per cent.\r\n\r\nThey consume but a small proportion of what they receive. The residue\r\nis partly forwarded for consumption in the inland parts of Europe, and\r\npartly re-shipped to other maritime countries. On the latter portion, they\r\nintercept between us and the consumer, so much of the real value as is\r\nabsorbed by the charges attending an intermediate deposit.\r\n\r\nForeign goods, except some East India articles, are received in the\r\nvessels of any nation.\r\n\r\nOur ships may be sold and naturalized there, with exceptions of one or\r\ntwo privileges, which scarcely lessen their value.\r\n\r\nIn the American possessions of the United Netherlands, and Sweden, our\r\nvessels and produce are received, subject to duties, not so heavy as to\r\nhave been complained of.\r\n\r\n_Great Britain_ receives our pot and pearl ashes free, while those of\r\nother nations pay a duty of two shillings and three pence the quintal.\r\nThere is an equal distinction in favor of our bar iron, of which article,\r\nhowever, we do not produce enough for our own use. Woods are free from us,\r\nwhilst they pay some small duty from other countries. Indigo and flaxseed\r\nare free from all countries. Our tar and pitch pay eleven pence sterling\r\nthe barrel. From other alien countries they pay about a penny and a third\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nOur tobacco, for their own consumption, pays one shilling three pence\r\nsterling the pound, custom and excise, besides heavy expenses of\r\ncollection; and rice, in the same case, pays seven shillings four pence\r\nsterling the hundred weight, which rendering it too dear as an article of\r\ncommon food, it is consequently used in very small quantity.\r\n\r\nOur salted fish, and other salted provisions, except bacon, are\r\nprohibited. Bacon and whale oils are under prohibitory duties: so are our\r\ngrains, meals and bread, as to internal consumption, unless in times of\r\nsuch scarcity as may raise the price of wheat to fifty shillings sterling\r\nthe quarter, and other grains and meals in proportion.\r\n\r\nOur ships, though purchased and navigated by their own subjects, are not\r\npermitted to be used, even in their trade with us.\r\n\r\nWhile the vessels of other nations are secured by standing laws, which\r\ncannot be altered but by the concurrent will of the three branches of\r\nthe British Legislature, in carrying thither any produce or manufacture\r\nof the country to which they belong, which may be lawfully carried\r\nin any vessels, ours, with the same prohibition of what is foreign,\r\nare further prohibited by a standing law (12. Car. 2. c. 18, s. 3,)\r\nfrom carrying thither all and any of our domestic productions and\r\nmanufactures. A subsequent act, indeed, has authorized their executive\r\nto permit the carriage of our own productions in our own bottoms, at\r\nits sole discretion; and the permission has been given from year to\r\nyear, by proclamation; but subject every moment to be withdrawn on that\r\nsingle will, in which event, our vessels having anything on board, stand\r\ninterdicted from the entry of all British ports. The disadvantage of\r\na tenure which may be so suddenly discontinued, was experienced by our\r\nmerchants on a late occasion, when an official notification that this law\r\nwould be strictly enforced, gave them just apprehensions for the fate of\r\ntheir vessels and cargoes despatched or destined to the ports of Great\r\nBritain. It was privately believed, indeed, that the order of that court\r\nwent further than their intention, and so we were, afterwards, officially\r\ninformed; but the embarrassments of the moment were real and great, and\r\nthe possibility of their renewal lays our commerce to that country under\r\nthe same species of discouragement, as to other countries where it is\r\nregulated by a single legislator; and the distinction is too remarkable\r\nnot to be noticed, that our navigation is excluded from the security of\r\nfixed laws, while that security is given to the navigation of others.\r\n\r\nOur vessels pay in their ports one shilling nine pence sterling per ton,\r\nlight and tritrity dues, more than is paid by British ships, except in\r\nthe port of London, where they pay the same as British.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of what they receive from us, is re-exported to other\r\ncountries, under the useless charges of an intermediate deposit and double\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nFrom tables published in England, and composed, as is said, from the books\r\nof their Custom Houses, it appears, that of the indigo imported there in\r\nthe years 1773-4-5, one third was re-exported; and from a document of\r\nauthority, we learn that of the rice and tobacco imported there before\r\nthe war, four-fifths were re-exported. We are assured, indeed, that the\r\nquantities sent thither for re-exportation since the war, are considerably\r\ndiminished; yet less so than reason and national interest would dictate.\r\nThe whole of our grain is re-exported, when wheat is below fifty shillings\r\nthe quarter, and other grains in proportion.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain admits in her islands our vegetables, live provisions,\r\nhorses, wood, tar, pitch and turpentine, rice and bread stuff, by a\r\nproclamation of her executive, limited always to the term of a year, but\r\nhitherto renewed from year to year. She prohibits our salted fish and\r\nother salted provisions. She does not permit our vessels to carry thither\r\nour own produce. Her vessels alone may take it from us, and bring in\r\nexchange, rum, molasses, sugar, coffee, cocoa nuts, ginger and pimento.\r\nThere are, indeed, some freedoms in the island of Dominica, but under\r\nsuch circumstances as to be little used by us. In the British continental\r\ncolonies, and in Newfoundland, all our productions are prohibited, and\r\nour vessels forbidden to enter their ports. Their Governors, however, in\r\ntimes of distress, have power to permit a temporary importation of certain\r\narticles in their own bottoms, but not in ours.\r\n\r\nOur citizens cannot reside as merchants or factors within any of the\r\nBritish plantations, this being expressly prohibited by the same statute\r\nof 12 Car. 2, c. 18, commonly called their navigation act.\r\n\r\nOf our commercial objects, _Spain_ receives favorably our bread stuff,\r\nsalted fish, wood, ships, tar, pitch, and turpentine. On our meals,\r\nhowever, when re-exported to their colonies, they have lately imposed\r\nduties of from half a dollar to two dollars the barrel, the duties being\r\nso proportioned to the current price of their own flour, as that both\r\ntogether are to make the constant sum of nine dollars per barrel.\r\n\r\nThey do not discourage our rice, pot and pearl ash, salted provisions, or\r\nwhale oil; but these articles being in small demand at their markets, are\r\ncarried thither but in a small degree. Their demand for rice, however, is\r\nincreasing. Neither tobacco nor indigo are received there.\r\n\r\nThemselves and their colonies are the actual consumers of what they\r\nreceive from us.\r\n\r\nOur navigation is free with the kingdom of Spain, foreign goods being\r\nreceived there in our ships on the same conditions as if carried in\r\ntheir own, or in the vessels of the country of which such goods are the\r\nmanufacture or produce.\r\n\r\n_Spain_ and _Portugal_ refuse to those parts of America which they govern,\r\nall direct intercourse with any people but themselves. The commodities\r\nin mutual demand between them and their neighbors, must be carried to be\r\nexchanged in some part of the dominant country, and the transportation\r\nbetween that and the subject State, must be in a domestic bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, February 16, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have duly received your letter of yesterday, with the statement\r\nof the duties payable on articles imported into Great Britain. The object\r\nof the report, from which I had communicated some extracts to you, not\r\nrequiring a minute detail of the several duties on every article, in\r\nevery country, I had presented both articles and duties in groups, and in\r\ngeneral terms, conveying information sufficiently accurate for the object.\r\nAnd I have the satisfaction to find, on re-examining the expression in\r\nthe report, that they correspond with your statement as nearly as generals\r\ncan with particulars. The differences which any nation makes between our\r\ncommodities and those of other countries, whether favorable or unfavorable\r\nto us, were proper to be noted. But they were subordinate to the more\r\nimportant questions, what countries _consume_ most of our produce, exact\r\nthe lightest duties, and leave to us the most favorable balance?\r\n\r\nYou seem to think that in the mention made of your _official_\r\ncommunication of April the 11th, 1792, that the clause in the navigation\r\nact (prohibiting our own produce to be carried in our own vessels into\r\nthe British European dominions) would be strictly enforced in future, and\r\nthe _private belief_ expressed at the same time, that the intention of\r\nthat court did not go so far, that the latter terms are not sufficiently\r\naccurate. About the fact it is impossible we should differ, because it\r\nis a written one. The only difference then, must be a merely verbal one.\r\nFor thus stands the fact: In your letter of April the 11th, you say, you\r\nhave received, by a circular despatch from your court, directions to\r\ninform this government that it had been determined in future strictly\r\nto enforce this clause of the navigation act. This I considered as an\r\n_official_ notification. In your answer of April the 12th to my request\r\nof explanation, you say, \"In answer to your letter of this day, I have the\r\nhonor of observing, that I have no other instructions upon the subject of\r\nmy communication, than such as are contained in the circular despatch, of\r\nwhich I stated the purport in my letter dated yesterday. I have, however,\r\nno difficulty in assuring you, that the result of my _personal conviction_\r\nis, that the determination of his Majesty's government to enforce\r\nthe clause of the act, &c., is not intended to militate against the\r\nproclamation,\" &c. This _personal conviction_ is expressed in the report\r\nas a _private belief_, in contradistinction to the _official_ declaration.\r\nIn your letter of yesterday, you choose to call it \"a formal assurance of\r\nyour conviction.\" As I am not scrupulous about words when they are once\r\nexplained, I feel no difficulty in substituting in your report your own\r\nwords, \"_personal conviction_,\" for those of \"_private belief_,\" which\r\nI had thought equivalent. I cannot indeed insert that it was a _formal_\r\nassurance, lest some readers might confound this with an _official_ one,\r\nwithout reflecting that you could not mean to give _official_ assurance\r\nthat the clause would be enforced, and _official_ assurance, at the same\r\ntime, of your personal conviction that it would not be enforced.\r\n\r\nI had the honor to acknowledge verbally the receipt of your letter of the\r\n3d of August, when you did me that of making the inquiry verbally about\r\nsix weeks ago; and I beg leave to assure you, that I am, with due respect,\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE TERNANT.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, February 17, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have duly received your letter of yesterday, and am sensible of\r\nyour favor in furnishing me with your observations on the statement of\r\nthe commerce between our two nations, of which I shall avail myself for\r\nthe good of both. The omission of our participation with your vessels, in\r\nthe exclusive transportation of our tobacco, was merely that of the copy,\r\nas it was expressed in the original draught where the same circumstance\r\nrespecting our whale oil was noted; and I am happy that your notice of it\r\nhas enabled me to reinstate it before the report goes out of my hand.\r\n\r\nI must candidly acknowledge to you, that I do not foresee the same effect\r\nin favor of our navigation, from the late reduction of duties on our\r\ntobaccos in France, which you seem to expect. The difference in favor of\r\nFrench vessels is still so great, as, in my opinion, to make it their\r\ninterest to quit all other branches of the carrying business, to take\r\nup this; and as your stock of shipping is not adequate to the carriage\r\nof all your exports, the branches which you abandon will be taken up\r\nby other nations; so that this difference thrusts us out of the tobacco\r\ncarriage, to let other nations in to the carriage of other branches of\r\nyour commerce. I must therefore avail myself of this occasion to express\r\nmy hope, that your nation will again revise this subject, and place it\r\non more equal grounds. I am happy in concurring with you more perfectly\r\nin another sentiment, that as the principles of our governments become\r\nmore congenial, the links of affection are multiplied between us. It is\r\nimpossible they should multiply beyond our wishes. Of the sincere interest\r\nwe take in the happiness and prosperity of your nation, you have had the\r\nmost unequivocal proofs.\r\n\r\nI pray you to accept assurances of sincere attachment to you personally,\r\nand of the sentiments of respect and esteem with which I am, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE TERNANT.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, February 20, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have laid before the President of the United States your\r\nnotification of the 17th instant, in the name of the Provisory Executive\r\nCouncil charged with the administration of your government, that the\r\nFrench nation has constituted itself into a Republic. The President\r\nreceives with great satisfaction this attention of the Executive Council,\r\nand the desire they have manifested of making known to us the resolution\r\nentered into by the National Convention, even before a definitive\r\nregulation of their new establishment could take place. Be assured, Sir,\r\nthat the government and the citizens of the United States, view with the\r\nmost sincere pleasure every advance of your nation towards its happiness,\r\nan object essentially connected with its liberty, and they consider the\r\nunion of principles and pursuits between our two countries, as a link\r\nwhich binds still closer their interests and affections. We earnestly wish\r\non our part that these our natural dispositions may be improved to mutual\r\ngood, by establishing our commercial intercourse on principles as friendly\r\nto natural right and freedom, as are those of our governments.\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, February 20, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--The House of Representatives, about the close of the session before\r\nthe last, referred to me the report of a committee on a message from\r\nthe President of the United States, of the 14th of February, 1791, with\r\ndirections to report to Congress the nature and extent of the privileges\r\nand restrictions of the commercial intercourse of the United States\r\nwith foreign nations, and measures for its improvement. The report was\r\naccordingly prepared during the ensuing recess, ready to be delivered at\r\nthe next session, that is to say, at the last. It was thought possible\r\nat that time, however, that some changes might take place in the existing\r\nstate of things, which might call for corresponding changes in measures.\r\nI took the liberty of mentioning this in a letter to the Speaker of\r\nthe House of Representatives, to express an opinion that a suspension\r\nof proceedings thereon, for a time, might be expedient, and to propose\r\nretaining the report till the present session, unless the House should\r\nbe pleased to signify their pleasure to the contrary. The changes then\r\ncontemplated have not taken place, nor, after waiting as long as the term\r\nof the session will admit, in order to learn something further on the\r\nsubject, can anything definite thereon be now said. If, therefore, the\r\nHouse wishes to proceed on the subject, the report shall be delivered at\r\na moment's warning. Should they not choose to take it up till their next\r\nsession, it will be an advantage to be permitted to keep it by me till\r\nthen, as some further particulars may perhaps be procured relative to\r\ncertain parts of our commerce, of which precise information is difficult\r\nto obtain. I make this suggestion, however, with the most perfect\r\ndeference to their will, the first intimation of which shall be obeyed on\r\nmy part, so as to occasion them no delay.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MINISTER OF FRANCE.\r\n\r\n                                           Philadelphia, February 23, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have laid before the President of the United States your\r\nnotification of the 17th instant, in the name of the Provisory Executive\r\nCouncil, charged with the administration of your Government, that the\r\nFrench nation has constituted itself into a Republic. The President\r\nreceives, with great satisfaction, this attention of the Executive\r\nCouncil and the desire they have manifested of making known to us\r\nthe resolution entered into by the National Convention, even before a\r\ndefinitive regulation of their new establishment could take place. Be\r\nassured, Sir, that the Government and the citizens of the United States\r\nview with the most sincere pleasure every advance of your nation towards\r\nits happiness, an object essentially connected with its liberty, and they\r\nconsider the union of principles and pursuits between our two countries\r\nas a link which binds still closer their interests and affections.\r\n[The genuine and general effusions of joy which you saw overspread our\r\ncountry on their seeing the liberties of yours rise superior to foreign\r\ninvasion and domestic trouble, have proved to you that our sympathies\r\nare great and sincere, and] we earnestly wish on our part that these, our\r\nmutual dispositions, may be improved to mutual good, by establishing our\r\ncommercial intercourse on principles as friendly to natural right and\r\nfreedom as are those of our Government. I am, with sincere esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                               March, 1793.\r\n\r\nThe idea seems to gain credit that the naval powers combining against\r\nFrance, will prohibit supplies, even of provisions, to that country.\r\nShould this be formally notified, I should suppose Congress would be\r\ncalled, because it is a justifiable cause of war, and as the Executive\r\ncannot decide the question of war on the affirmative side, neither ought\r\nit to do so on the negative side, by preventing the competent body from\r\ndeliberating on the question. But I should hope that war would not be\r\ntheir choice. I think it will furnish us a happy opportunity of setting\r\nanother precious example to the world, by showing that nations may be\r\nbrought to do justice by appeals to their interests as well as by appeals\r\nto arms. I should hope that Congress, instead of a denunciation of war,\r\nwould instantly exclude from our ports all the manufactures, produce,\r\nvessels and subjects of the nations committing this aggression, during the\r\ncontinuance of the aggression, and till full satisfaction made for it.\r\nThis would work well in many ways, safely in all, and introduce between\r\nnations another umpire than arms. It would relieve us, too, from the risks\r\nand the horrors of cutting throats. The death of the King of France has\r\nnot produced as open condemnations from the monocrats as I expected. I\r\ndined the other day in a company where the subject was discussed. I will\r\nname the company in the order in which they manifested their partialities;\r\nbeginning with the warmest Jacobinism, and proceeding by shades, to the\r\nmost heart felt aristocracy. Smith, (N. Y.,) Coxe, Stewart, T. Shippen,\r\nBingham, Peters, Breck, Meredith, Wolcott. It is certain that the ladies\r\nof this city, of the first circle, are open-mouthed against the murderers\r\nof a sovereign, and they generally speak those sentiments which the more\r\ncautious husband smothers. Ternant has at length openly hoisted the flag\r\nof monarchy by going into deep mourning for his prince. I suspect he\r\nthinks a cessation of his visits to me a necessary accompaniment to this\r\npious duty. A connection between him and Hamilton seems to be springing\r\nup. On observing that Duer was Secretary to the old Board of Treasury, I\r\nsuspect him to have been the person who suggested to Hamilton the letter\r\nof mine to that board, which he so tortured in his Catullus. Dunlop has\r\nrefused to print the piece which we had heard of before your departure,\r\nand it has been several days in Bache's hands, without any notice of it.\r\nThe President will leave this about the 27th instant, and return about\r\nthe 20th of April. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAJOR GENERAL GATES.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 12, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear General,--During the invasion of Virginia in 1780 and 178--,\r\nnearly the whole of the public records of that State were destroyed\r\nby the British. The least valuable part of these happens to be the\r\nmost interesting to me, I mean the letters I had occasion to write to\r\nthe characters with whom my office in the Executive brought me into\r\ncorrespondence. I am endeavoring to recover copies of my letters from the\r\nhands to whom they were addressed, and have been happy to find this more\r\npracticable than I had apprehended. While you commanded in the south, I\r\nhad occasion to write to you sometimes on the subject of our proceedings.\r\nIf you happen to have preserved these letters, you will particularly\r\noblige me by trusting me with them till I can have them copied, when the\r\noriginals shall be returned. If you could repose the same confidence in me\r\nas to the letters you addressed to me, it would increase the obligation.\r\nThe whole shall be sacredly returned. I have been the more disposed to\r\ntrouble you on this occasion as it furnishes me a pretext of recalling\r\nmyself to your recollection, and an opportunity of expressing to you\r\nassurances of the sincere esteem and respect with which I have the honor\r\nto be, dear General, your sincere friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 12, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Your Nos. 8 to 13, inclusive, have been duly received. I\r\nam sensible that your situation must have been difficult during the\r\ntransition from the late form of government to the re-establishment\r\nof some other legitimate authority, and that you may have been at a\r\nloss to determine with whom business might be done. Nevertheless, when\r\nprinciples are well understood, their application is less embarrassing.\r\nWe surely cannot deny to any nation that right whereon our own government\r\nis founded, that every one may govern itself according to whatever form\r\nit pleases, and change these forms at its own will; and that it may\r\ntransact its business with foreign nations through whatever organ it\r\nthinks proper, whether King, Convention, Assembly, Committee, President,\r\nor anything else it may choose. The will of the nation is the only thing\r\nessential to be regarded. On the dissolution of the late constitution in\r\nFrance, by removing so integral a part of it as the King, the National\r\nAssembly, to whom a part only of the public authority had been delegated,\r\nappear to have considered themselves as incompetent to transact the\r\naffairs of the nation legitimately. They invited their fellow-citizens,\r\ntherefore, to appoint a National Convention. In conformity with this\r\ntheir idea of the defective state of the national authority, you were\r\ndesired from hence to suspend further payments of our debt to France\r\ntill new orders, with an assurance, however, to the acting power, that\r\nthe suspension should not be continued a moment longer than should be\r\nnecessary for us to see the re-establishment of some person or body of\r\npersons authorized to receive payment and give us a good acquittal; (if\r\nyou should find it necessary to give any assurance or explanation at all.)\r\nIn the meantime, we went on paying up the four millions of livres which\r\nhad been destined by the last constituted authorities to the relief of\r\nSt. Domingo. Before this was completed, we received information that a\r\nNational Assembly had met, with full powers to transact the affairs of\r\nthe nation, and soon afterwards, the minister of France here presented an\r\napplication for three millions of livres, to be laid out in provisions to\r\nbe sent to France. Urged by the strongest attachment to that country, and\r\nthinking it even providential that moneys lent to us in distress could\r\nbe re-paid under like circumstances, we had no hesitation to comply with\r\nthe application, and arrangements are accordingly taken, for furnishing\r\nthis sum at epochs accommodated to the demand and our means of paying\r\nit. We suppose this will rather overpay the instalments and interest due\r\non the loans of eighteen, six, and ten millions, to the end of 1792; and\r\nwe shall certainly use our utmost endeavors to make punctual payments\r\nof the instalments and interest hereafter becoming exigible, and to omit\r\nno opportunity of convincing that nation how cordially we wish to serve\r\nthem. Mutual good offices, mutual affection, and similar principles\r\nof government, seem to destine the two nations for the most intimate\r\ncommunion; and I cannot too much press it on you, to improve every\r\nopportunity which may occur in the changeable scenes which are passing,\r\nand to seize them as they occur, for placing our commerce with that nation\r\nand its dependencies, on the freest and most encouraging footing possibly.\r\n\r\nBesides what we have furnished publicly for the relief of St. Domingo,\r\nindividual merchants of the United States have carried considerable\r\nsupplies thither, which have been sometimes purchased, sometimes taken by\r\nforce, and bills given by the administration of the colony on the minister\r\nhere, which have been protested for want of funds. We have no doubt that\r\njustice will be done to these our citizens, and that without a delay which\r\nwould be ruinous to them. We wish authority to be given to the minister\r\nof France here to pay the just demands of our citizens, out of the moneys\r\nhe may receive from us.\r\n\r\nDuring the fluctuating state of the _assignats_ of France, I must ask\r\nthe favor of you to inform me, in every letter, of the rate of exchange\r\nbetween them and coin, this being necessary for the regulation of our\r\nCustom Houses.\r\n\r\nCongress closed its session on the 2d instant. You will see their acts in\r\nthe newspapers forwarded to you, and the body of them shall be sent as\r\nsoon as the octavo edition is printed. We are to hold a treaty with the\r\nwestern Indians in the ensuing month of May, but not under very hopeful\r\nauspices.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive by the newspapers, a remarkable fall in the price of\r\nour public paper. This is owing chiefly to the extraordinary demand for\r\nthe produce of our country, and a temporary scarcity of cash to purchase\r\nit. The merchants holding public paper are obliged to part with it at any\r\nprice, to raise money.\r\n\r\nI sent you, by the way of London, a dozen plans of the city of Washington\r\nin the federal territory, hoping you would have them displayed to public\r\nview where they would be most seen by those descriptions of men worthy\r\nand likely to be attracted to it. Paris, Lyons, Rouen, and the sea port\r\ntowns of Havre, Nantes, Bordeaux and Marseilles, would be proper places\r\nto send some of them. I trust to Mr. Taylor to forward you the newspapers\r\nby every direct occasion to France. These are rare at all times, and\r\nespecially in the winter; and to send them through England would cost\r\ntoo much in postage. To these circumstances, as well, probably, as to\r\nsome miscarriages, you must ascribe the length of intervals sometimes\r\nexperienced in the receipt of your papers.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem and respect, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 15, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--The President has seen with satisfaction, that the ministers\r\nof the United States in Europe, while they have avoided an useless\r\ncommitment of their nation on the subject of the Marquis de La Fayette,\r\nhave nevertheless shown themselves attentive to his situation. The\r\ninterest which the President himself, and our citizens in general, take\r\nin the welfare of this gentleman, is great and sincere, and will entirely\r\njustify all prudent efforts to serve him. I am therefore to desire, that\r\nyou will avail yourself of every opportunity of sounding the way towards\r\nhis liberation, of finding out whether those in whose power he is are\r\nvery tenacious of him, of insinuating through such channels as you shall\r\nthink suitable, the attentions of the government and people of the United\r\nStates to this object, and the interest they take in it, and of procuring\r\nhis liberation by informal solicitations, if possible. But if formal ones\r\nbe necessary, and the moment should arrive when you shall find that they\r\nwill be effectual, you are authorized to signify, through such channel as\r\nyou shall find suitable, that our government and nation, faithful in their\r\nattachments to this gentleman for the services he has rendered them, feel\r\na lively interest in his welfare, and will view his liberation as a mark\r\nof consideration and friendship for the United States, and as a new motive\r\nfor esteem and a reciprocation of kind offices towards the power to whom\r\nthey shall be indebted for this act.\r\n\r\nA like letter being written to Mr. Pinckney, you will of course take care,\r\nthat however you may act through different channels, there be still a\r\nsufficient degree of concert in your proceedings.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 16, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I wrote you on the 30th of December, and again a short letter\r\non the 1st of January, since which I have received yours of October the 2d\r\nand 5th, November 6th and 9th, and December the 13th, 14th, 15th. I now\r\nenclose you the Treasurer's second of exchange for twenty-four thousand\r\nseven hundred and fifty guilders, to be employed in the purchase of copper\r\nfor the mint, from Sweden, or wherever else it can be got on the best\r\nterms; the first of exchange having been enclosed in my letter of December\r\nthe 30th.\r\n\r\nI am in hopes you will have been able to enter into proper arrangements\r\nwith the British minister for the protection of our seamen from\r\nimpressment, before the preparations for war shall have produced\r\ninconvenience to them. While he regards so minutely the inconveniences to\r\nthemselves which may result from a due regulation of this practice, it is\r\njust he should regard our inconveniences also, from the want of it. His\r\nobservations in your letter imply merely, that if they should abstain from\r\ninjuring us, it might be attended with inconvenience to themselves.\r\n\r\nYou ask, what should be your conduct, in case you should at any\r\ntime discover negotiations to be going on, which might eventually be\r\ninteresting to us? The nature of the particular case will point out what\r\nmeasures, on your part, would be the most for our interest, and to your\r\ndiscretion we must refer the taking such measures, without waiting for\r\ninstructions, where circumstances would not admit of such a delay. A\r\nlike necessity to act may arise on other occasions. In the changeable\r\nscenes, for instance, which are passing in Europe, were a moment to offer\r\nwhen you could obtain any advantage for our commerce, and especially in\r\nthe American colonies, you are desired to avail us of it to the best\r\nadvantage, and not to let the occasion slip by for want of previous\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nYou ask, what encouragements are given to emigrants by the several States?\r\nNo other than a permission to become citizens, and to participate of the\r\nrights of citizens, except as to eligibility to certain offices in the\r\ngovernment. The rules, as to these, are not uniform in the States. I have\r\nfound it absolutely impracticable to obtain, even for my office, a regular\r\ntransmission of the laws of the several States: consequently, it would be\r\nmore so to furnish them to our ministers abroad. You will receive by this\r\nor the first proper conveyance, those of Congress, passed at their last\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to give any authority for the advance of moneys\r\nto Mr. Wilson. Were we to do it in his case, we should, on the same\r\nprinciples, be obliged to do it in several others wherein foreign nations\r\ndecline or delay doing justice to our citizens. No law of the United\r\nStates would cover such an act of the executive; and all we can do\r\nlegally, is, to give him all the aid which our patronage of his claims\r\nwith the British court, can effect.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the payment of your allowances, as the laws authorize the\r\npayment of a given number of dollars to you, and as your duties place you\r\nin London, I suppose we are to pay you _the dollars_ there, or other money\r\nof equal value, estimated by the par of the metals. Such has, accordingly,\r\nbeen the practice ever since the close of the war. Your powers to draw on\r\nour bankers in Holland, will leave you the master of fixing your drafts\r\nby this standard.\r\n\r\nThe transactions of Europe are now so interesting, that I should be\r\nobliged to you, every week, to put the Leyden gazettes of the week under\r\ncover to me; and put them into such ship's bags as shall be first coming\r\nto any port north of North Carolina.\r\n\r\nMr. Barclay's death is just made known to us, and measures are taking in\r\nconsequence of it.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive by the newspapers, a remarkable fall in the price of\r\nour public paper. This is owing chiefly to the extraordinary demand for\r\nthe produce of our country, and a temporary scarcity of cash to purchase\r\nit. The merchants holding public paper are obliged to part with it at any\r\nprice, to raise money.\r\n\r\nI am, with much respect, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ----[22]\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 18, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I received your kind favor of the 26th ult., and thank you for\r\nits contents as sincerely as if I could engage in what they propose. When\r\nI first entered on the stage of public life (now twenty-four years ago),\r\nI came to a resolution never to engage while in public office in any kind\r\nof enterprise for the improvement of my fortune, nor to wear any other\r\ncharacter than that of a farmer. I have never departed from it in a single\r\ninstance; and I have in multiplied instances found myself happy in being\r\nable to decide and to act as a public servant, clear of all interest,\r\nin the multiform questions that have arisen, wherein I have seen others\r\nembarrassed and biased by having got themselves into a more interested\r\nsituation. Thus I have thought myself richer in contentment than I should\r\nhave been with any increase of fortune. Certainly I should have been much\r\nwealthier had I remained in that private condition which renders it lawful\r\nand even laudable to use proper efforts to better it. However, my public\r\ncareer is now closing, and I will go through on the principle on which\r\nI have hitherto acted. But I feel myself under obligations to repeat my\r\nthanks for this mark of your attention and friendship.\r\n\r\nWe have just received here the news of the decapitation of the King\r\nof France. Should the present foment in Europe not produce republics\r\neverywhere, it will at least soften the monarchical governments by\r\nrendering monarchs amenable to punishment like other criminals, and doing\r\naway that rages of insolence and oppression, the inviolability of the\r\nKing's person. We I hope shall adhere to our republican government, and\r\nkeep it to its original principles by narrowly watching it. I am, with\r\ngreat and sincere affection, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n     [22] [No address.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 21, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--The death of Admiral Paul Jones first, and afterwards of Mr.\r\nBarclay, to whom the mission to Algiers, explained in the enclosed\r\npapers, was successively confided, have led the President to desire you\r\nto undertake the execution of it in person. These papers, being copies of\r\nwhat had been delivered to them, will serve as your guide. But Mr. Barclay\r\nhaving been also charged with a mission to Morocco, it will be necessary\r\nto give you some trouble with respect to that also.\r\n\r\nMr. Nathaniel Cutting, the bearer hereof, is despatched specially, first\r\nto receive from Mr. Pinckney in London any papers or information, which\r\nhis agency in the Algerine business may have enabled him to communicate\r\nto you: he will then proceed to deliver the whole to you, and accompany\r\nand aid you in the character of secretary.\r\n\r\nIt is thought necessary that you should, in the first instance, settle Mr.\r\nBarclay's accounts respecting the Morocco mission, which will probably\r\nrender it necessary that you should go to Gibraltar. The communications\r\nyou have had with Mr. Barclay in this mission, will assist you in your\r\nendeavors at a settlement. You know the sum received by Mr. Barclay on\r\nthat account, and we wish as exact a statement as can be made of the\r\nmanner in which it has been laid out, and what part of its proceeds is\r\nnow on hand. You will be pleased to make an inventory of these proceeds\r\nnow existing. If they or any part of them can be used for the Algerine\r\nmission, we would have you by all means apply them to that use, debiting\r\nthe Algerine fund and crediting that of Morocco with the amount of such\r\napplication. If they cannot be so used, then dispose of the perishable\r\narticles to the best advantage, and if you can sell those not perishable\r\nfor what they cost, do so, and what you cannot so sell, deposit in any\r\nsafe place under your own power. In this last stage of the business,\r\nreturn us an exact account, 1. Of the specific articles remaining on hand\r\nfor that mission, and their value. 2. Of its cash on hand. 3. Of any money\r\nwhich may be due to or from Mr. Barclay or any other person on account of\r\nthis mission; and take measures for replacing the clear balance of cash\r\nin the hands of Messrs. W. and J. Willincks, and Nicholas and Jacob Van\r\nStaphorsts and Hubbard.\r\n\r\nThis matter being settled, you will be pleased to proceed on the mission\r\nto Algiers. This you will do by the way of Madrid, if you think any\r\ninformation you can get from Mr. Carmichael or any other, may be an\r\nequivalent for the trouble, expense and delay of the journey. If not,\r\nproceed in whatever other way you please to Algiers.\r\n\r\nProper powers and credentials for you, addressed to that government, are\r\nherewith enclosed. The instructions first given to Admiral Paul Jones are\r\nso full that no others need be added, except a qualification in one single\r\narticle, to wit: should that government finally reject peace on the terms\r\nin _money_, to which you are authorized to go, you may offer to make the\r\nfirst payments for peace and that for ransom in _naval stores_, reserving\r\nthe right to make the subsequent annual payments in money.\r\n\r\nYou are to be allowed your travelling expenses, your salary as minister\r\nresident in Portugal going on. Those expenses must be debited to the\r\nAlgerine mission, and not carried into your ordinary account as resident.\r\nMr. Cutting is allowed one hundred dollars a month, and his expenses,\r\nwhich, as soon as he joins you, will of course be consolidated with yours.\r\nWe have made choice of him as particularly qualified to aid, under your\r\ndirection, in the matters of account, with which he is well acquainted.\r\nHe receives here an advance of one thousand dollars, by a draft on our\r\nbankers in Holland, in whose hands the fund is deposited. This, and all\r\nother sums furnished him, to be debited to the Algerine fund. I enclose\r\nyou a letter to our bankers giving you complete authority over these\r\nfunds, which you had better send with your first draft, though I send a\r\ncopy of it from hence by another opportunity.\r\n\r\nThis business being done, you will be pleased to return to Lisbon, and\r\nto keep yourself and us, thereafter, well informed of the transactions\r\nin Morocco; and as soon as you shall find that the succession to\r\nthat government is settled and staple, so that we may know to whom a\r\ncommissioner may be addressed, be so good as to give us the information,\r\nthat we may take measures in consequence.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with much respect, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL SHAW, CONSUL AT CANTON, IN CHINA.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 21, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--Present appearances in Europe rendering a general war there\r\nprobable, I am to desire your particular attention to all the indications\r\nof it, and on the first imminent symptoms of rupture among the maritime\r\npowers, to put our vessels on their guard. In the same event the patronage\r\nof our Consuls will be particularly requisite to secure to our vessels\r\nthe right of neutrality, and protect them against all invasions of it.\r\nYou will be pleased, also, in the same case, to give no countenance to\r\nthe usurpation of our flag by foreign vessels, but rather, indeed, to aid\r\nin detecting it, as without bringing to us any advantage, the usurpation\r\nwill tend to commit us with the belligerent powers, and to subject\r\nthose vessels which are truly ours to harassing scrutinies in order to\r\ndistinguish them from the counterfeits.\r\n\r\nThe law requiring the Consuls of the United States to give bond with\r\ntwo or more good sureties for the faithful performance of their duties,\r\nI enclose you a blank bond for that purpose. According to a standing\r\nregulation which places our Consuls in Europe in relation with the\r\nMinister of the United States in the same country with them, if there be\r\none, and if none, then with their minister in Paris, and our Consuls in\r\nAmerica in immediate relation with the Secretary of State, you will be\r\npleased to have your sureties approved by the person to whom you stand\r\nthus referred, and to send the bond when executed, by a safe conveyance,\r\nto the Secretary of State, to be disposed of according to law; and this\r\nwith all the expedition the case will admit, provided this should not\r\nhave been done before. A set of the laws of the United States is likewise\r\nherewith enclosed, together with a copy of a former circular letter,\r\nintended as a standing instruction to our Consuls.\r\n\r\nI am, with esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL DAVID.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 22, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I thank you sincerely for your friendly letter of January 8.\r\nParticular circumstances have forced me to protract awhile my departure\r\nfrom office, which, however, will take place in the course of the year.\r\nContinue, therefore, if you please, the general address of your letters,\r\nto \"The Secretary of State,\" &c., as recommended. Be assured that I\r\nshall carry into retirement and retain the most affectionate sentiments\r\ntowards you. I am, in truth, worn down with drudgery, and while every\r\ncircumstance relative to my private affairs calls imperiously for my\r\nreturn to them, not a single one exists which could render tolerable\r\na continuation in public life. I do not wonder that Captain O'Bryan\r\nhas lost patience under his long-continued captivity, and that he may\r\nsuppose some of the public servants have neglected him and his brethren.\r\nHe may possibly have imputed neglect to me, because a forbearance to\r\ncorrespond with him would have that appearance, though it was dictated by\r\nthe single apprehension, that if he received letters from me as Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary of the United States at Paris, or as Secretary of State,\r\nit would increase the expectations of the captors, and raise the ransom\r\nbeyond what his countrymen would be disposed to give, and so end in their\r\nperpetual captivity. But, in truth, I have labored for them constantly\r\nand zealously in every situation in which I have been placed. In the\r\nfirst moment of their captivity, I first proposed to Mr. Adams to take\r\nupon ourselves their ransom, though unauthorized by Congress. I proposed\r\nto Congress and obtained their permission to employ the Order of Mercy in\r\nFrance for their ransom, but never could obtain orders for the money till\r\njust as I was leaving France, and was obliged to turn the matter over to\r\nMr. Short. As soon as I came here I laid the matter before the President\r\nand Congress in two long reports, but Congress could not decide till the\r\nbeginning of 1792, and then clogged their ransom by a previous requisition\r\nof peace. The unfortunate death of two successive commissioners have\r\nstill retarded their relief, and even should they be now relieved, will\r\nprobably deprive me of the gratification of seeing my endeavors for them\r\ncrowned at length with success by their arrival when I am here. It would,\r\nindeed, be grating to me if, after all, I should be supposed by them to\r\nhave been indifferent to their situation. I will ask of your friendship\r\nto do me justice in their eyes, that to the pain I have already felt\r\nfor them, may not be added that of their dissatisfaction. I explained my\r\nproceedings on their behalf to a Dr. Warner, whom I saw at Paris, on his\r\nway to Algiers, and particularly the reason why I did not answer O'Bryan's\r\nletter. I desired him to communicate it to Captain O'Bryan. But I did not\r\nknow whether he did it. I think it more probable that Mr. Carmichael will\r\nimpute to me also an event which must take place this year. In truth,\r\nit is so extraordinary a circumstance, that a public agent placed in a\r\nforeign court for the purpose of correspondence, should, in three years,\r\nhave found means to get but one letter to us, that he must himself be\r\nsensible that if he could have sent us letters, he ought to be recalled\r\nas negligent, and if he could not, he ought to be recalled as useless.\r\nI have, nevertheless, procured his continuance, in order to give him an\r\nopportunity which occurred of his rendering a sensible service to his\r\ncountry, and thereby drawing some degree of favor on his return.\r\n\r\nWishing you every circumstance of success and happiness, I am, with great\r\nesteem, dear Sir, your sincere friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 22, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters from No. 60\r\nto 67, inclusive. You cannot be too vigilant against any such treaty as\r\nthat mentioned in No. 60, which, by giving the exclusive supply of wheat\r\nto Naples, would altogether debar the United States from it. This would\r\nbear so hard on us, that not only an exclusion of their wines from the\r\nUnited States ought to be expected on their part, but every other measure\r\nwhich might open to us a market _in any other part of the world_, however\r\nPortugal might be affected by it. And I must forever repeat it, that,\r\ninstead of excluding our _wheat_, we must continue to hope that they will\r\nopen their ports to our _flour_, and that you will continue to use your\r\nefforts, on every good occasion, to obtain this without waiting for a\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nAs there appears at present a probability of a very general war in Europe,\r\nyou will be pleased to be particularly attentive to preserve for our\r\nvessels all the rights of neutrality, and to endeavor that our flag be not\r\nusurped by others to procure to themselves the benefits of our neutrality.\r\nThis usurpation tends to commit us with foreign nations, to subject those\r\nvessels truly ours to rigorous scrutinies and delays, to distinguish them\r\nfrom counterfeits, and to take the business of transportation out of our\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nContinue, if you please, your intelligence relative to the affairs of\r\nSpain, from whence we learn nothing but through you; to which it will be\r\nacceptable that you add leading events from other countries, as we have\r\nseveral times received important facts through you, even from London,\r\nsooner than they have come from London directly.\r\n\r\nThe letters enclosed for Mr. Carmichael and Mr. Short are of a very secret\r\nnature. If you go by Madrid, you will be the bearer of them yourself;\r\nif not, it would be better to retain them than to send them by any\r\nconveyance which does not command your entire confidence. I have never\r\nyet had a letter from Mr. Carmichael but the one you brought from Madrid.\r\nA particular circumstance will occasion forbearance yet a little longer.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cutting will bring you a copy of the laws of the last session of\r\nCongress, and of the gazettes to the time of his departure.\r\n\r\nNot yet knowing the actual arrival of Mr. Church at Lisbon, I believe\r\nit will be safer that I direct letters for you, during your absence, to\r\nMessrs. Bulkeley and Son, with whom you will leave what directions on the\r\nsubject you shall think proper.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem and respect, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. CARMICHAEL AND SHORT.[23]\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 23, 1793.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--It is intimated to us in such a way as to attract our\r\nattention, that France means to send a strong force early this spring\r\nto offer independence to the Spanish American colonies, beginning with\r\nthose on the Mississippi; and that she will not object to the receiving\r\nthose on the east side into our confederation. Interesting considerations\r\nrequire, that we should keep ourselves free to act in this case according\r\nto circumstances, and consequently, that you should not, by any clause of\r\ntreaty, bind us to guarantee any of the Spanish colonies against their own\r\nindependence, nor indeed against any other nation. For when we thought\r\nwe might guarantee Louisiana, on their ceding the Floridas to us, we\r\napprehended it would be seized by Great Britain, who would thus completely\r\nencircle us with her colonies and fleets. This danger is now removed\r\nby the concert between Great Britain and Spain; and the times will soon\r\nenough give independence, and consequently free commerce to our neighbors,\r\nwithout our risking the involving ourselves in a war for them.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect and esteem, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n[24]The above meets the approbation of\r\n                                                         George Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n     [23] [This letter was in cypher, but a literal copy of it preserved.]\r\n\r\n     [24] [This is in the handwriting of General Washington.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 24, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of September\r\n20, March 13, and Jan. 9. I shall hope your continuance to send us the\r\nLeyden Gazette as usual, but all the other gazettes which you have\r\nhitherto usually sent, may be discontinued. The scene in Europe is\r\nbecoming very interesting. Amidst the confusion of a general war which\r\nseems to be threatening that quarter of the globe, we hope to be permitted\r\nto preserve the line of neutrality. We wish not to meddle with the\r\ninternal affairs of any country, nor with the general affairs of Europe.\r\nPeace with all nations, and the right which that gives us with respect\r\nto all nations, are our object. It will be necessary for all our public\r\nagents to exert themselves with vigilance for securing to our vessels\r\nall the rights of neutrality, and from preventing the vessels of other\r\nnations from usurping our flag. This usurpation tends to commit us with\r\nthe belligerent power, to draw on those vessels truly ours, vigorous\r\nvisitations to distinguish them from the counterfeits, and to take\r\nbusiness from us. I recommend these objects to you. I have done the same\r\nto Mr. Greenleaf, lately appointed our Consul at Amsterdam. Be so good\r\nas to remember to send your account immediately after the 30th of June.\r\nI forward for you to Mr. Pinckney a copy of the laws of the late session\r\nof Congress; and am, with sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, March 27, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--In compliance with the desire you expressed, I shall endeavor to\r\ngive you the view I had of the destination of the loan of three millions\r\nof florins, obtained by our bankers in Amsterdam, previous to the acts\r\nof the 4th and 12th of August, 1790, when it was proposed to adopt it\r\nunder those acts. I am encouraged to do this by the degree of certainty\r\nwith which I can do it, happening to possess an official paper wherein\r\nI had committed to writing some thoughts on the subject, at the time,\r\nthat is to say, on the 26th of August, 1790. The general plan presented\r\nto view, according to my comprehension of it, in your report and draught\r\nof instructions, was, 1, to borrow, on proper terms, such a sum of money\r\nas might answer all demands for principal and interest of the foreign\r\ndebt due to the end of 1791; 2, to consider two of the three millions of\r\nflorins already borrowed as if borrowed under the act of August 4, and\r\nso far an execution of the operation before mentioned; 3, to consider\r\nthe third million of florins so borrowed as if borrowed under the act of\r\nthe 12th of August, and so far an execution of the powers given to the\r\nPresident to borrow two millions of dollars for the purchase of the public\r\ndebt. I remember that the million of dollars surplus of the domestic\r\nrevenues, appropriated to the purchase of the public debt, appeared to me\r\nsufficient for that purpose _here_, for probably a considerable time. I\r\nthought, therefore, if any part of the three millions of florins were to\r\nbe placed under the act of the 12th of August, that it should rather be\r\nemployed in purchasing our _foreign paper_ at the market of Amsterdam.\r\nI had myself observed the different degrees of estimation in which the\r\npaper of different countries was held at that market, and wishing that our\r\ncredit there might always be of the first order, I thought a moderate sum\r\nkept in readiness there to buy up any of our _foreign paper_, whenever\r\nit should be offered below par, would keep it constantly to that mark,\r\nand thereby establish for us a sound credit, where, of all places in the\r\nworld, it would be most important to have it.\r\n\r\nThe subject, however, not being with my department, and therefore having\r\nno occasion afterwards to pay attention to it, it went out of my mind\r\naltogether, till the late inquiries brought it forward again. On reading\r\nthe President's instructions of August 28, 1790 (two days later than the\r\npaper before mentioned), as printed in your report of February 13, 1793,\r\nin the form in which they were ultimately given to you, I observed that\r\nhe had therein neither confirmed _your_ sentiment of employing a part\r\nof the money _here_, nor _mine_ of doing it _there_, in purchases of the\r\npublic debt: but had directed the application of the whole to the _foreign\r\ndebt_; and I inferred that he had done this on full and just deliberation,\r\nwell knowing he would have time enough to weigh the merits of the two\r\nopinions, before the million of dollars would be examined _here_, or the\r\nloans for the foreign debt would overrun their legal measure _there_. In\r\nthis inference, however, I might be mistaken; but I cannot be in the fact\r\nthat these instructions gave a sanction to neither opinion.\r\n\r\nI have thus, Sir, stated to you the view I had of this subject in 1790,\r\nand I have done it because you desired it. I did not take it up then as a\r\nvolunteer, nor should now have taken the trouble of recurring to it, but\r\nat your request, as it is one in which I am not particularly concerned,\r\nwhich I never had either the time or inclination to investigate, and on\r\nwhich my opinion is of no importance.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with respect, Sir, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, April 7, 1793.\r\n\r\nWe may now, I believe, give full credit to the accounts that war is\r\ndeclared between France and England. The latter having ordered Chauvelen\r\nto retire within eight days, the former seemed to consider it as too\r\nunquestionable an evidence of an intention to go to war, to let the\r\nadvantage slip of her own readiness and the unreadiness of England. Hence,\r\nI presume, the first declaration from France. A British packet is arrived;\r\nbut as yet we have nothing more than that she confirms the accounts of\r\nwar being declared. Genett not yet arrived. An impeachment is ordered here\r\nagainst Nicholson, their Comptroller General, by a vote almost unanimous\r\nof the House of Representatives. There is little doubt, I am told, that\r\nmuch _mala fides_ will appear; but E. R. thinks he has barricaded himself\r\nwithin the fences of the law.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, April 18, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have now the honor to enclose you the answer of the Attorney\r\nGeneral to my letter covering yours of March the 12th, on the case of\r\nHooper and Pagan, wherein he has stated the proceedings of Pagan for\r\nobtaining a writ of error from the Supreme Court of the United States, for\r\nrevisal of the judgment of the inferior court pronounced against him; and\r\nalso, his opinion on the merits of the question, had the writ of error\r\nbeen procured, and the merits thereby been brought into question. From\r\nthis statement you will be able to judge whether Pagan has, _bona fide_,\r\ncomplied with the rule which requires that a foreigner, before he applies\r\nfor extraordinary interposition, should use his best endeavors to obtain\r\nthe justice he claims from the ordinary tribunals of the country. You\r\nwill perceive also, that had the writ been pressed for and obtained, and\r\nthe substantial justice of Pagan's claim thereby brought into discussion,\r\nsubstantial justice would have been against him, according to the opinion\r\nof the Attorney General, according to the uniform decisions of the courts\r\nof the United States, even in the cases of their own citizens, and\r\naccording to the decision of this very case in the British provincial\r\ncourt, where the evidence was taken and the trial first had. This does\r\nnot appear then to be one of those cases of gross and palpable wrong,\r\nascribable only to wickedness of the heart, and not to error of the head,\r\nin the judges who have decided on it, and founding a claim of national\r\nsatisfaction. At least, that it is so, remains yet to be demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThe readiness with which the government of the United States has entered\r\ninto inquiries concerning the case of Mr. Pagan, even before that case\r\nwas ripe for their interposition, according to ordinary rules, will, I\r\nhope, satisfy you that they would, with equal readiness, have done for\r\nthe redress of his case whatever the laws and Constitution would have\r\npermitted them to do, had it appeared in the result that their courts had\r\nbeen guilty of partiality or other gross wrong against Mr. Pagan. On the\r\ncontrary, it is hoped, that the marked attentions which have been shown to\r\nhim by the government of Massachusetts, as well as by that of the United\r\nStates, have evinced the most scrupulous dispositions to patronize and\r\neffectuate his right, had right been on his side. I have the honor to be,\r\nwith due respect, Sir, your most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_The letter of the Attorney General, referred to in the preceding._]\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, April 12, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--You will perceive from the two letters marked A. and B. of which I\r\nenclose copies, that the subject of Mr. Pagan has been for some time in my\r\nview. The former of those letters being intended for you, and containing\r\na summary of facts, I determined to show it to Mr. Tilghman, who was\r\nPagan's counsel, before it was sent to you, in order that he might correct\r\nany misstatement. This produced the latter letter from him to me; and I\r\nhave thought it more advisable to forward both of them to you, even in\r\nthe unfinished state of my own, than to reduce the case into a form which\r\nmight be supposed to be less accurate.\r\n\r\nAs I do not discover an essential difference between Mr. Tilghman and\r\nmyself, I shall not discuss any seeming variance, but proceed upon his\r\nideas.\r\n\r\nIt is too obvious to require a diffusive exposition, that the application\r\nfor a writ of error was not only prudent, but a duty in Pagan. To this Mr.\r\nTilghman explicitly assents, when he says that he was perfectly \"satisfied\r\nof the prudence of applying for the writ of error, as Pagan could not\r\ncomplain of a defect of justice, until he had tried the writ of error and\r\nfound that mode ineffectual.\" This remark becomes the more important,\r\nas it manifests that the process was not suggested as an expedient for\r\nshifting any burthen from the government. Indeed I may with truth add,\r\nthat the proceedings, taken collectively, appeared to me to present\r\na sufficient intimation of the main question, to serve as a ground of\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nHowever, take the case under either aspect; as excluding the consideration\r\nof the main question by an omission in the pleadings and record; or as\r\nexhibiting it fully to the cognizance of the court.\r\n\r\nIt never was pretended that a writ of error ought to have been granted,\r\nunless the matter was apparent on the record. Whose office was it to\r\nmake it thus apparent? Of the attorney who managed the pleadings. If,\r\ntherefore, he has failed to do so, we may presume that he considered\r\nthe ground untenable, or was guilty of inattention. Either presumption\r\nwould be fatal to a citizen of the United States; and the condition of a\r\nforeigner cannot create a new measure in the administration of justice. It\r\nis moreover certain, that those who have been consulted on Pagan's behalf,\r\nas well as others, have seriously doubted whether a cause, which has been\r\npursued to the extent which his had reached before the commencement of\r\nour new government, was susceptible of federal relief.\r\n\r\nThe last observation opens the inquiry, what remedy ought the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States to have administered, even if the question had\r\nbeen fairly before them? My opinion is, that the very merits are against\r\nMr. Pagan. In America, the construction of the armistice has been almost\r\nuniversally to compute the places, within which different times were to\r\nprevail, by latitude only. Am I misinformed, that such an interpretation\r\nhas been pressed by _our_ ministers, and not denied by those of London?\r\nA second mode has been adopted, by describing a circle, and thereby\r\ncomprehending longitude as well as latitude; now let either rule be\r\nadopted, and the position of the capture in this case will be adverse to\r\nPagan's pretensions.\r\n\r\nBut what can be exacted from our government, after repeated trials, before\r\nvarious jurisdictions, none of which can be charged with any symptom\r\nof impropriety, and upon a subject, which, to say no more, is at least\r\nequipoised? Nothing; and I appeal to the British reasoning on the Silesia\r\nloan, as supporting this sentiment, in the following passage: \"The law of\r\nnations, founded upon justice, equity, convenience and the reason of the\r\nthing, and confirmed by long usage, does not allow of reprisals, except\r\nin case of violent injuries directed and supported by the State, and\r\njustice absolutely denied, in _re minime dubia_, by all the tribunals,\r\nand afterwards by the prince.\" Where the judges are left free, and give\r\nsentence according to their consciences, \"though it should be erroneous,\r\nthat would be no ground for reprisals. Upon doubtful questions, different\r\nmen think and judge differently; and all a friend can desire is, that\r\njustice should be as impartially administered to him, as it is to the\r\nsubjects of that prince, in whose courts the matter is tried.\" Under such\r\ncircumstances, a citizen must acquiesce. So therefore must Pagan; against\r\nwhom even the court of Nova Scotia, within the dominions of his sovereign,\r\nhas once decided.\r\n\r\nThere are many smaller points, arising from the controversy, which might\r\nbe relied on. But I pass them over, from a hope that the observations\r\nalready made will induce you to think with me, that government is not\r\nbound to interpose farther in the behalf of Pagan. I have the honor, Sir,\r\nto be, with respect and esteem, your most obedient servant,\r\n                                                           Edmond Randolph.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, April 20, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--In a postscript to my letter of the 12th, I acknowledged the\r\nreceipt of yours of January the 3d; since which, those of January the 30th\r\nand February the 5th have been received by the William Penn.\r\n\r\nWith respect to our negotiation with Mr. Hammond, it is exactly in the\r\nstate in which it was when you left America, not one single word having\r\nbeen received in reply to my general answer, of which you had a copy. He\r\nsays, he waits for instructions, which he pretends to expect from packet\r\nto packet. But sometimes the ministers are all in the country, sometimes\r\nthey are absorbed in negotiations nearer home, sometimes it is the hurry\r\nof impending war, or attention to other objects, the stock of which is\r\ninexhaustible, and can therefore never fail those who desire nothing but\r\nthat things shall rest as they are. Perhaps, however, the present times\r\nmay hasten justice.\r\n\r\nWe shall be glad to receive the assayer you hope to procure, as soon as\r\npossible, for we cannot get one in this country equal to the business in\r\nall its parts. With respect to Mr. Drost, we retain the same desire to\r\nengage him, but we are forced to require an immediate decision, as the\r\nofficer employed in the interim, and who does tolerably well, will not\r\ncontinue much longer under an uncertainty of permanent employment. I must\r\ntherefore desire you to press Mr. Morris to bring Drost to an immediate\r\ndetermination; and we place the matter on this ground with him, that if he\r\nis not embarked by the first day of July next, we shall give a permanent\r\ncommission to the present officer, and be free to receive no other. We\r\nare likely to be in very great distress for copper for the mint, and must\r\ntherefore press your expediting what we desired you to order from Sweden.\r\n\r\nYou may, on every occasion, give assurances which cannot go beyond the\r\nreal desires of this country, to preserve a fair neutrality in the present\r\nwar, on condition that the rights of neutral nations are respected in\r\nus, as they have been settled in _modern_ times, either by the express\r\ndeclarations of the powers of Europe, or their adoption of them on\r\nparticular occasions. From our treaties with France and Holland, and\r\nthat of England and France, a very clear and simple line of conduct can\r\nbe marked out for us, and I think we are not unreasonable in expecting\r\nthat England shall recognize towards us the same principles which she has\r\nstipulated to recognize towards France, in a state of neutrality.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. VAN BERCKEL.\r\n\r\n                                             Philadelphia, April 23d, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--As far as the public gazettes are to be credited, we may presume\r\nthat war has taken place among several of the nations of Europe, in\r\nwhich France, England, Holland and Russia, are particularly engaged.\r\nDisposed, as the United States are, to pursue steadily the ways of peace,\r\nand to remain in friendship with all nations, the President has thought\r\nit expedient, by Proclamation, of which I enclose you a copy, to notify\r\nthis disposition to our citizens, in order to intimate to them the line\r\nof conduct for which they are to prepare; and this he has done without\r\nwaiting for a formal notification from the belligerent Powers. He hopes\r\nthat those Powers and your nation in particular, will consider this early\r\nprecaution as a proof, the more candid, as it has been unasked, for the\r\nsincere and impartial intentions of our country, and that what is meant\r\nmerely as a general intimation to our citizens, shall not be construed\r\nto their prejudice in any Courts of Admiralty, as if it were conclusive\r\nevidence of their knowledge of the existence of war, and of the Powers\r\nengaged in it. Of this we could not give them conclusive information,\r\nbecause we have it not ourselves; and till it is given us in form, and\r\nso communicated to them, we must consider all their acts as lawful, which\r\nwould have been lawful in a state of peace. I have the honor to be, with\r\ngreat respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR TO MESSRS. MORRIS, PINCKNEY AND SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, April 26, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--The public papers giving us reason to believe that the war is\r\nbecoming nearly general in Europe, and that it has already involved\r\nnations with which we are in daily habits of commerce and friendship,\r\nthe President has thought it proper to issue the proclamation of which\r\nI enclose you a copy, in order to mark out to our citizens the line of\r\nconduct they are to pursue. That this intimation, however, might not work\r\nto their prejudice, by being produced against them as conclusive evidence\r\nof their knowledge of the existence of war and of the nations engaged in\r\nit, in any case where they might be drawn into courts of justice for acts\r\ndone without that knowledge, it has been thought necessary to write to\r\nthe representatives of the belligerent powers here, the letter of which\r\na copy is also enclosed, reserving to our citizens those immunities to\r\nwhich they are entitled, till authentic information shall be given to\r\nour government by the parties at war, and be thus communicated, with\r\ndue certainty, to our citizens. You will be pleased to present to the\r\ngovernment where you reside, this proceeding of the President, as a\r\nproof of the earnest desire of the United States to preserve peace and\r\nfriendship with all the belligerent powers, and to express his expectation\r\nthat they will in return extend a scrupulous and effectual protection to\r\nall our citizens, wheresoever they may need it, in pursuing their lawful\r\nand peaceable concerns with their subjects, or within their jurisdiction.\r\nYou will, at the same time, assure them that the most exact reciprocation\r\nof this benefit shall be practised by us towards their subjects, in the\r\nlike cases.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem and respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE TERNANT.\r\n\r\n                                              Philadelphia, April 27, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--Your letter of the 13th instant, asking moneys to answer the\r\nexpenses and salaries of the consular offices of France, has been duly\r\nlaid before the President, and his directions thereon taken.\r\n\r\nI have in consequence to observe to you, that before the new government\r\nof France had time to attend to things on this side the Atlantic, and\r\nto provide a deposit of money for their purposes here, there appeared a\r\ndegree of necessity that we, as the friends and debtors of that nation,\r\nshould keep their affairs from suffering, by furnishing money for\r\nurgent purposes. This obliged us to take on ourselves to judge of the\r\npurpose, because, on the soundness of that, we were to depend for our\r\njustification. Hence we furnished moneys for their colonies and their\r\nagents here, without express authority, judging from the importance and\r\nnecessity of the case, that they would approve of our interference.\r\n\r\nBut this kind of necessity is now at an end; the government has\r\nestablished a deposit of money in the hands of their minister here, and\r\nwe have nothing now to do but to furnish the money, which we are in the\r\ncourse of doing, without looking into the purposes to which it is to be\r\napplied. Their minister is to be the judge of these, and to pay it to whom\r\nand for what he pleases.\r\n\r\nIf it be urged that they have appropriated all the money we are furnishing\r\nto other objects, that you are not authorized to divert any of it to\r\nany other purpose, and therefore that you _need a further sum_, it may\r\nbe answered that it will not lessen the stretch of authority to add\r\nan _unauthorized payment by us_ to an _unauthorized application_ by\r\nyou, and that it seems fitter that their minister should exercise a\r\ndiscretion over their appropriations, standing, as he does, in a place of\r\nconfidence, authority, and responsibility, than we who are strangers, and\r\nunamenable to them. It is a respect we owe to their authority to leave\r\nto those acting under that, the transactions of their affairs, without an\r\nintermeddling on our part which might justly appear officious.\r\n\r\nIn this point of light, I hope you will view our conduct, and that the\r\nconsular officers will be sensible that in referring them to your care,\r\nunder which the national authority has placed them, we do but conform\r\nourselves to that authority. I have the honor to be, with sentiments\r\nof great respect and esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                 Philadelphia, May 1, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--When you mentioned to me yesterday that M. de Ternant proposed to\r\napply for a sum of money, and founded himself on a letter of mine which\r\ngave him reason to expect it, I thought I could not have written such a\r\nletter, because I did not recollect it, and because it was out of the plan\r\nwhich you know had been adopted, that when we furnished one sum of money\r\nwe should avoid promising another. I have now most carefully examined all\r\nmy letters to M. de Ternant, as far back as March 7, 1792, the date of\r\nthe first on the subject of furnishing money, and can assure you there is\r\nnot a word in one of them which can be construed into a promise, expressed\r\nor implied, relative to the present subject, or which can have committed\r\nthe government in the smallest degree to a departure from the rules it\r\nhas laid down. I am equally confident that I have never said a word which\r\ncould do it. Upon the ground, therefore, of any such commitment by me,\r\nthe proposition will not be supported. With respect to these applications\r\nin general, they were of course to pass through me; but I have considered\r\nthem as depending too much on the arrangements of your department to\r\npermit myself to take and be tenacious of any particular ground other than\r\nthat, whatever rule we adopt, it be plain and persevered in uniformly in\r\nall cases where the material circumstances are the same, so that we never\r\nrefuse to one what has been done for another. It is and ever has been my\r\nopinion and wish that we should gratify the diplomatic gentlemen in every\r\nway in which we can do it without too great inconvenience or commitment of\r\nour own government. I think it our interest to do so; and am under this\r\nimpression in the present case so much, that I should readily concur, if\r\nit be the pleasure of the President, in reconsidering the rule adopted on\r\na late occasion, and substituting any other consistent with our public\r\nduties, more adapted to the gratification of the diplomatic gentlemen,\r\nand uniformly to be applied where the material circumstances shall be the\r\nsame; for it would reverse our aim were we to put ourselves in the case\r\nof disobliging one by refusing what we have done to gratify another. In\r\nthese sentiments, I will hand to the President any application which M.\r\nde Ternant shall think proper to communicate to me in writing. I have the\r\nhonor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE TERNANT.\r\n\r\n                                                 Philadelphia, May 3, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--The Minister Plenipotentiary of his Britannic Majesty has\r\nrepresented to the government of the United States, that on the 25th of\r\nApril last, the British ship Grange, while lying at anchor in the bay of\r\nDelaware, within the territory and jurisdiction of the United States, was\r\ntaken possession of by the Embuscade, a frigate of the French Republic,\r\nhas been brought to this port, where she is now detained as prize, and the\r\ncrew as prisoners, and has made a requisition in form, for a restoration\r\nof the vessel and liberation of the crew. I have the honor to furnish\r\nyou with copies of the evidence given in by the British minister, and\r\nto observe, that the United States being at peace with all parties,\r\ncannot see with indifference its territory or jurisdiction violated by\r\neither; that the government will therefore proceed to inquire into the\r\nfacts, and for that purpose will receive with pleasure, and consider with\r\nimpartiality, any evidence you will be pleased to have them furnished\r\nwith on the subject; and the President hopes that you will take effectual\r\nmeasures for detaining here the vessel taken, her crew and cargo, to\r\nabide the decision which will be made thereon, and which is desired to be\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                 Philadelphia, May 5, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--The expectation that you are always from home prevents my\r\nwriting to you with regularity; a matter of little consequence to you, as\r\nyou probably receive Freneau's paper regularly, and consequently all the\r\nnews of any importance.\r\n\r\nThe fiscal party having tricked the House of Representatives out of the\r\nnegative vote they obtained, seem determined not to lose the ground they\r\ngained by entering the lists again on matters of fact and reason; they\r\ntherefore preserve a triumphant silence, notwithstanding the attack\r\nof the pamphlet entitled \"An Examination Se-and-of-Timon.\" They show\r\ntheir wisdom in this, if not their honesty. The war between France and\r\nEngland seems to be producing an effect not contemplated. All the old\r\nspirit of 1776, rekindling the newspapers from Boston to Charleston,\r\nproves this; and even the monocrat papers are obliged to publish the\r\nmost furious philippics against England. A French frigate took a British\r\nprize off the capes of Delaware the other day, and sent her up here.\r\nUpon her coming into sight, thousands and thousands of the _yeomanry_ of\r\nthe city crowded and covered the wharves. Never before was such a crowd\r\nseen there; and when the British colors were seen _reversed_, and the\r\nFrench flying above them, they burst into peals of exultation. I wish\r\nwe may be able to repress the spirit of the people within the limits\r\nof a fair neutrality. In the meantime, H. is panic-struck, if we refuse\r\nour breach to every kick which Great Britain may choose to give it. He\r\nis for proclaiming at once the most abject principles, such as would\r\ninvite and merit habitual insults; and indeed every inch of ground must\r\nbe fought in our councils to desperation, in order to hold up the face\r\nof even a sneaking neutrality, for our votes are generally two and a\r\nhalf against one and a half. Some propositions have come from him which\r\nwould astonish Mr. Pitt himself with their boldness. If we preserve even\r\na sneaking neutrality, we shall be indebted for it to the President, and\r\nnot to his counsellors. Immense bankruptcies have taken place in England.\r\nThe last advices made them amount to eleven millions sterling, and still\r\ngoing on. Of the houses connected with America, they have fallen only\r\non those who had dealt in American paper. The beginning of the business\r\nwas from the alarm occasioned by the war, which induced cautious people\r\nto withdraw their money from the country banks. This induced the Bank of\r\nEngland to stop discounting, which brought on a general crush, which was\r\nstill going on. It is said that two millions of manufacturers would be\r\nput out of employ by these failures. This is probably exaggerated. The\r\nstocks are very low here now, and an immense mass of paper is expected\r\nto be returned immediately from England, so that they will be still\r\nlower. Notwithstanding this, the sinking fund is idle, not having had\r\na shilling to lay out (except the interest of the part sunk). You will\r\nsee in Freneau's next paper, a most advantageous decree of the French\r\nNational Assembly in our favor. They have lately sustained some severe\r\nchecks. The papers will confuse you on the subject. The truth is, that\r\nin a combination of three operations, Clairfayt killed and wounded 1,400,\r\ntook 600. Saxe Cobourg killed and wounded 4,000, and took 1,600. Brunswick\r\nkilled and wounded 1,300, and took 700. This is the sum. Their defects\r\nare as sensibly felt at Philadelphia as at Paris, and I foresee we are to\r\nhave a trying campaign of it. Great Britain has as yet not condescended to\r\nnotice us in any way. No wish expressed of her neutrality, no answer of\r\nany kind to a single complaint for the daily violations committed on our\r\nsailors and ships. Indeed, we promise beforehand so fast that she has not\r\ntime to ask anything. We expect Genet daily. When Ternant received certain\r\naccount of his appointment, thinking he had nothing further to hope from\r\nthe Jacobins, he that very day found out something to be offended at in\r\nme (in which I had been made _ex officio_ the ostensible agent in what\r\ncame from another quarter, and he has never been undeceived), attached\r\nhimself intimately to Hamilton, put on mourning for the King, and became\r\na perfect counter revolutioner. A few days ago, he received a letter\r\nfrom Genet, giving him a hope that they will employ him in the army. On\r\nthis, he tacked about again, became a Jacobin, and refused to present the\r\nViscount Noailles, and some French aristocrats arrived here. From what I\r\nlearn from Noailles, La Fayette has been more imprudent than I expected,\r\nbut certainly innocent.\r\n\r\nPresent my best affections to Mrs. Monroe, and accept them for yourself\r\nalso. Yours sincerely.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\n                                                 Philadelphia, May 7, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Since my letter of April the 16th, yours have been received of\r\nMarch the 12th, 12th, 13th, 13th, and 19th. Before the receipt of these,\r\none of which covered the form of your passports, it had been determined\r\nhere, that passports should be issued in _our own ports_ only, as well\r\nto secure us against those collusions which would be fraudulent towards\r\nour friends, and would introduce a competition injurious to our own\r\nvessels, as to induce these to remain in our own service, and thereby\r\ngive to the productions of our own soil the protection of its own flag\r\nin its passage to foreign markets. As our citizens are free to purchase\r\nand use _foreign-built_ vessels, and these, like all their other lawful\r\nproperty, are entitled to the protection of their government, passports\r\nwill be issued to them as freely as to _home-built_ vessels. This is\r\nstrictly within our treaties, the letter of which, as well as their\r\nspirit, authorizes passports to all vessels _belonging_ to citizens of\r\nthe United States. Our laws, indeed, indulge home-built vessels with\r\nthe payment of a lower tonnage, and to evidence their right to this,\r\npermit them alone to take out registers from our own offices; but they do\r\nnot exclude foreign-built vessels owned by our citizens from any other\r\nright. As our home built vessels are adequate to but a small proportion\r\nof our transportation, if we could not suddenly augment the stock of our\r\nshipping, our produce would be subject to war insurance in the vessels of\r\nthe belligerent powers, though we remain at peace ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn one of your letters of March the 13th, you express your apprehension\r\nthat some of the belligerent powers may stop our vessels going with grain\r\nto the ports of their enemies, and ask instructions which may meet the\r\nquestion in various points of view, intending, however, in the meantime,\r\nto contend for the amplest freedom of neutral nations. Your intention\r\nin this is perfectly proper, and coincides with the ideas of our own\r\ngovernment in the particular case you put, as in general cases. Such a\r\nstoppage to an unblockaded port would be so unequivocal an infringement\r\nof the neutral rights, that we cannot conceive it will be attempted.\r\nWith respect to our conduct as a neutral nation, it is marked out in our\r\ntreaties with France and Holland, two of the belligerent powers; and as\r\nthe duties of neutrality require an _equal_ conduct to both parties,\r\nwe should, on that ground, act on the same principles towards Great\r\nBritain. We presume that this would be satisfactory to her because of\r\nits equality, and because she too has sanctioned the same principles in\r\nher treaty with France. Even our seventeenth article with France, which\r\nmight be disagreeable, as from its nature it is unequal, is adopted\r\nexactly by Great Britain in her fortieth article with the same power, and\r\nwould have laid her, in a like case, under the same unequal obligations\r\nagainst us. We wish then, that it could be arranged with Great Britain,\r\nthat our treaties with France and Holland, and that of France and Great\r\nBritain (which agree in what respects neutral nations), should form the\r\nline of conduct for us all, in the present war, in the cases for which\r\nthey provide. Where they are silent, the general principles of the law\r\nof nations must give the rule, as the principles of that law have been\r\nliberalized in latter times by the refinement of manners and morals,\r\nand evidenced by the declarations, stipulations, and practice of every\r\ncivilized nation. In our treaty with Prussia, indeed, we have gone ahead\r\nof other nations, in doing away restraints on the commerce of peaceful\r\nnations, by declaring that nothing shall be contraband. For in truth, in\r\nthe present improved state of the arts, when every country has such ample\r\nmeans of procuring arms within and without itself, the regulations of\r\ncontraband answer no other end than to draw other nations into the war.\r\nHowever, as other nations have not given sanction to this improvement, we\r\nclaim it, at present, with Prussia alone.\r\n\r\nYou are desired to persevere till you obtain a regulation to guard our\r\nvessels from having their hands impressed, and to inhibit the British\r\nnavy officers from taking them under the pretext of their being British\r\nsubjects. There appears but one practical rule, that the vessel being\r\nAmerican, shall be conclusive evidence that the hands are so to a certain\r\nnumber, proportioned to her tonnage. Not more than one or two officers\r\nshall be permitted to visit a vessel. Mr. Albion Coxe has just arrived.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n                                                               May 8, 1793.\r\n\r\nI have been still reflecting on the draft of letter from the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury to the custom house officers, instructing them to be on\r\nthe watch as to all infractions or tendencies to infraction of the laws\r\nof neutrality by our citizens, and to communicate the same to him. When\r\nthis paper was first communicated to me, though the whole of it struck me\r\ndisagreeably, I did not in the first moment see clearly the improprieties\r\nbut of the last clause. The more I have reflected, the more objectionable\r\nthe whole appears. By this proposal the collectors of the customs are to\r\nbe made an established corps of spies or informers against their fellow\r\ncitizens, whose actions they are to watch in secret, inform against in\r\nsecret to the Secretary of the Treasury, who is to communicate it to the\r\nPresident. If the action and evidence appear to justify a prosecution,\r\na prosecution is to be set on foot on the _secret information of a\r\ncollector_. If it will not justify it, then the only consequence is that\r\nthe mind of government has been poisoned against a citizen, neither\r\nknown nor suspecting it, and perhaps too distant to bring forward his\r\njustification. This will at least furnish the collector with a convenient\r\nweapon to keep down a rival, draw a cloud over an inconvenient censor, or\r\nsatisfy mere malice and private enmity. The object of this new institution\r\nis to be to prevent infractions of the laws of neutrality, and preserve\r\nour peace with foreign nations. Acts involving war, or proceedings which\r\nrespect foreign nations, seem to belong either to the department of\r\nwar, or to that which is charged with the affairs of foreign nations;\r\nbut I cannot possibly conceive how the superintendence of the laws of\r\nneutrality, or the preservation of our peace with foreign nations, can be\r\nascribed to the department of the treasury, which I suppose to comprehend\r\nmerely matters of revenue. It would be to add a new and a large field to a\r\ndepartment already amply provided with business, patronage, and influence.\r\nIt was urged as a reason that the collectors of the customs are in\r\nconvenient positions for this espionage. They are in convenient positions\r\ntoo for building ships of war; but will that business be transplanted from\r\nits department, merely because it can be conveniently done in another?\r\nIt seemed the desire that if this means was disapproved, some other\r\nequivalent might be adopted. Though we consider the acts of a foreigner\r\nmaking a captive within our limits, as an act of public hostility, and\r\ntherefore to be turned over to the military, rather than the civil power;\r\nyet the acts of our own citizens infringing the laws of neutrality or\r\ncontemplating that, are offences against the ordinary laws and cognisable\r\nby them. Grand juries are the constitutional inquisitors and informers of\r\nthe country, they are scattered everywhere, see everything, see it while\r\nthey suppose themselves mere private persons, and not with the prejudiced\r\neye of a permanent and systematic spy. Their information is on _oath_,\r\nis public, it is in the vicinage of the party charged, and can be at once\r\nrefuted. These officers taken only occasionally from among the people, are\r\nfamiliar to them, the office respected, and the experience of centuries\r\nhas shown that it is safely entrusted with our character, property and\r\nliberty. A grand juror cannot carry on systematic persecution against\r\na neighbor whom he hates, because he is not permanent in the office.\r\nThe judges generally, by a charge, instruct the grand jurors in the\r\ninfractions of law which are to be noticed by them; and our judges are in\r\nthe habit of printing their charges in the newspapers. The judges, having\r\nnotice of the proclamation, will perceive that the occurrence of a foreign\r\nwar has brought into activity the laws of neutrality, as a part of the law\r\nof the land. This new branch of the law they will know needs explanation\r\nto the grand juries more than any other. They will study and define the\r\nsubjects to them and to the public. The public mind will by this be warned\r\nagainst the acts which may endanger our peace, foreign nations will see a\r\nmuch more respectable evidence of our _bona fide_ intentions to preserve\r\nneutrality, and society will be relieved from the inquietude which must\r\nforever be excited by the knowledge of the existence of such a poison\r\nin it as secret accusation. It will be easy to suggest this matter to\r\nthe attention of the judges, and that alone puts the whole machine into\r\nmotion. The one is a familiar, impartial and precious instrument, the\r\nother, not popular in its present functions, will be odious in the new\r\nones, and the odium will reach the Executive, who will be considered as\r\nhaving planted a germ of private inquisition absolutely unknown to our\r\nlaws. I am not quite certain what was considered as agreed upon yesterday;\r\nit cannot be too late, however, to suggest the substitution of the judges\r\nand grand jurors in place of the collectors of the customs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                 Philadelphia, May 8, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--I had wished to have kept back the issuing passports for sea\r\nvessels till the question should be decided whether the treaty with France\r\nshould be declared void, lest the issuing the passports presented by that\r\ntreaty might be considered as prejudging the question. The importunities,\r\nhowever, of the owners obliging me to give out a few, I had them printed\r\nin the Dutch form only. Not then having sufficiently considered on the\r\nbest mode of distributing them, I took the liberty, as an expedient of\r\nthe moment, of sending seven (the number of vessels then waiting in this\r\nport) to Mr. Delaney, asking the favor of him to fill them up and deliver\r\nthem for me. Application for another parcel coming, and the applicant\r\nnot being able to wait himself till I could send them to be signed by the\r\nPresident, he desired I would lodge them with Mr. Cox, on whom it would\r\nbe convenient for him to call for them. I did so; and afterwards sent a\r\nsecond parcel of a dozen, which were pressingly requested. The President\r\nhaving now decided that the French passport may also be used, it is at\r\nthis time in the press, and the whole instrument completed with the two\r\npassports. Letters and certificate in its final form, will be ready for\r\nsignature to-morrow. It has therefore now become necessary to determine\r\non the ultimate channel of distributing them. I am not the judge whether\r\nthe task of distribution might interfere too much with the other duties of\r\nthe collectors of the customs. If it would not, their position seems best\r\naccommodated to that distribution. I took the liberty, therefore, to-day,\r\nof proposing to the President that, if you should think there would be no\r\ninconvenience in charging them with the distribution, the blanks might\r\nbe lodged with them; of which he approved, and I have now the honor of\r\nsubmitting that question to you. If you find no inconvenience in it, I\r\nwill send 500 blanks, as soon as they shall be signed, either to your\r\noffice or to that of the commissioners of the revenue, whichever you shall\r\nprefer, to be forwarded to the collectors of the different ports; and from\r\ntime to time afterwards will keep up a supply. Should it, however, in your\r\nopinion, interfere too much with the other duties of those officers, I\r\nwill submit to the President the depositing them with the deputy marshals\r\nappointed, or to be appointed in every port.\r\n\r\nI will ask the favor of your answer, as the applications are numerous and\r\npressing, and I am unwilling to be further troublesome to the gentlemen\r\nwho have hitherto been so kind as to fill up and deliver them for me till\r\nsome arrangement would be made which might relieve me personally from\r\na business with the details of which I was not acquainted. I have the\r\nhonor to be, with great respect. Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                                    May 13.\r\n\r\nI wrote you on the 5th covering an open letter to Colonel Monroe, since\r\nthat I have received yours of April 29. We are going on here in the same\r\nspirit still. The Anglophobia has seized violently on three members of\r\nour council. This sets almost every day on questions of neutrality. H.\r\nproduced the other day the draft of a letter from himself to the collector\r\nof the customs, giving them in charge to watch over all proceedings in\r\ntheir district, contrary to the laws of neutrality or tending to impair\r\nour peace with the belligerent powers, and particularly to observe if\r\nvessels pierced for guns should be built, and to inform _him_ of it. This\r\nwas objected to, 1st. As setting up a system of espionage, destructive\r\nof the peace of society. 2d. Transferring to the treasury department the\r\nconservation of the laws of neutrality and peace with foreign nations.\r\n3d. It was rather proposed to intimate to the judges that the laws\r\nrespecting neutrality being now come into activity, they should charge\r\ngrand juries with the observance of them; these being constitutional and\r\npublic informers, and the person accused knowing of what they should do,\r\nand having an opportunity of justifying themselves. E. R. found out a hair\r\nto split, which, as always happens, became the decision. H. is to write\r\nto the collectors of the customs, who are to convey their information to\r\nthe attorney of the district, to whom E. R. is to write, to receive their\r\ninformation and proceed by indictment. The clause respecting the building\r\nvessels pierced for guns is to be omitted; for, though three against one,\r\nthought it would be a breach of neutrality; yet they thought we might\r\ndefer giving a public opinion on it as yet. Everything, my dear Sir,\r\nhangs upon the opinion of a single person, and that the most indecisive\r\none I ever had to do business with. He always contrives to agree in\r\nprinciple with one, but in conclusion with the other. Anglophobia,\r\nsecret anti-gallomany, a federalisme outree, and a present ease in his\r\ncircumstances not usual, have decided the complexion of our dispositions,\r\nand our proceedings towards the conspirators against human liberty, and\r\nthe asserters of it, which is unjustifiable in principle, in interest,\r\nand in respect to the wishes of our constituents. A manly neutrality,\r\nclaiming the liberal rights ascribed to that condition by the very persons\r\nat war, was the part we should have taken, and would I believe have given\r\nsatisfaction to our allies. If anything prevents its being a mere English\r\nneutrality, it will be that the penchant of the President is not that\r\nway, and above all, the ardent spirit of our constituents. The line is\r\nnow drawn so clearly as to show on one side, 1. The fashionable circles of\r\nPhiladelphia, New York, Boston and Charleston, (natural aristocrats.) 2.\r\nMerchants trading on British capital. 3. Paper men, (all the old tories\r\nare found in some one of the three descriptions.) On the other side\r\nare, 1. Merchants trading on their own capital. 2. Irish merchants. 3.\r\nTradesmen, mechanics, farmers, and every other possible description of our\r\ncitizens. Genett is not yet arrived though hourly expected. I have just\r\nheard that the workmen I had desired from Europe were engaged and about\r\nto embark. Another strong motive for making me uneasy here. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\n                                                Philadelphia, May 15, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--Your several memorials of the 8th instant have been laid before\r\nthe President, as had been that of the 2d, as soon as received. They have\r\nbeen considered with all the attention and the impartiality which a firm\r\ndetermination to do what is equal and right between all the belligerent\r\npowers, could inspire.\r\n\r\nIn one of these, you communicate, on the information of the British\r\nconsul at Charleston, that the consul of France at the same place had\r\ncondemned as legal prize, a British vessel, captured by a French frigate,\r\nand you justly add that this judicial act is not warranted by the usage\r\nof nations, nor by the stipulations existing between the United States\r\nand France. I observe further, that it is not warranted by any law of\r\nthe land. It is consequently a mere nullity; as such it can be respected\r\nin no court, can make no part in the title to the vessel, nor give to\r\nthe purchaser any other security than what he would have had without\r\nit. In short, it is so absolutely nothing as to give no foundation of\r\njust concern to any person interested in the fate of the vessel; and in\r\nthis point of view, Sir, I am in hopes you will see it. The proceeding,\r\nindeed, if the British consul has been rightly informed, and we have\r\nno other information of it, has been an act of disrespect towards the\r\nUnited States, to which its government cannot be inattentive; a just\r\nsense of our own rights and duties, and the obviousness of the principle,\r\nare a security that no inconveniences will be permitted to arise from\r\nrepetitions of it.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of arms and military accoutrements by an agent of the French\r\ngovernment, in this country, with an intent to export them to France,\r\nis the subject of another of the memorials. Of this fact we are equally\r\nuninformed as of the former. Our citizens have been always free to make,\r\nvend and export arms. It is the constant occupation and livelihood of\r\nsome of them. To suppress their callings, the only means perhaps of their\r\nsubsistence, because a war exists in foreign and distant countries, in\r\nwhich we have no concern, would scarcely be expected. It would be hard\r\nin principle, and impossible in practice. The law of nations, therefore,\r\nrespecting the rights of those at peace, does not require from them such\r\nan internal derangement in their occupations. It is satisfied with the\r\nexternal penalty pronounced in the President's proclamation, that of\r\nconfiscation of such portion of these arms as shall fall into the hands of\r\nany of the belligerent powers on their way to the ports of their enemies.\r\nTo this penalty our citizens are warned that they will be abandoned;\r\nand that even private contraventions may work no inequality between the\r\nparties at war, the benefits of them will be left equally free and open\r\nto all.\r\n\r\nThe capture of the British ship Grange by the French frigate l'Embuscade,\r\nhas on inquiry been found to have taken place within the bay of Delaware\r\nand jurisdiction of the United States, as stated in your memorial of\r\nthe 2d instant. The government is, therefore, taking measures for the\r\nliberation of the crew and restitution of the ship and cargo.\r\n\r\nIt condemns in the highest degree the conduct of any of our citizens who\r\nmay personally engage in committing hostilities at sea against any of the\r\nnations, parties to the present war, and will exert all the means with\r\nwhich the laws and Constitution have armed them to discover such as offend\r\nherein, and bring them to condign punishment. Of these dispositions I am\r\nauthorized to give assurances to all the parties, without reserve. Our\r\nreal friendship for them all, our desire to pursue ourselves the path\r\nof peace, as the only one leading surely to prosperity, and our wish to\r\npreserve the morals of our citizens from being vitiated by courses of\r\nlawless plunder and murder, may assure you that our proceedings in this\r\nrespect, will be with good faith, fervor and vigilance. Instructions\r\nare consequently given to the proper law officer, to institute such\r\nproceedings as the laws will justify, for apprehending and punishing\r\ncertain individuals of our citizens, suggested to have been concerned in\r\nenterprises of this kind, as mentioned in one of your memorials of the\r\n8th instant.\r\n\r\nThe practice of commissioning, equipping and manning vessels in our ports,\r\nto cruise on any of the belligerent parties, is equally and entirely\r\ndisapproved; and the government will take effectual measures to prevent\r\na repetition of it. The remaining point in the same memorial is reserved\r\nfor further consideration.\r\n\r\nI trust, Sir, that in the readiness with which the United States have\r\nattended to the redress of such wrongs as are committed by their citizens,\r\nor within their jurisdiction, you will see proofs of their justice and\r\nimpartiality to all parties; and that it will insure to their citizens\r\npursuing their lawful business by sea or by land, in all parts of the\r\nworld, a like efficacious interposition of governing powers to protect\r\nthem from injury, and redress it, where it has taken place. With such\r\ndispositions on both sides, vigilantly and faithfully carried into effect,\r\nwe may hope that the blessings of peace on the one part, will be as little\r\nimpaired, and the evils of war on the other, as little aggravated, as the\r\nnature of things will permit; and that this should be so, is, we trust,\r\nthe prayer of all.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE TERNANT.[25]\r\n                                                Philadelphia, May 15, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--Having received several memorials from the British minister on\r\nsubjects arising out of the present war, I take the liberty of enclosing\r\nthem to you, and shall add an explanation of the determinations of the\r\ngovernment thereon. These will serve to indicate the principles on which\r\nit is meant to proceed; and which are to be applied, with impartiality,\r\nto the proceedings of both parties. They will form, therefore, as far as\r\nthey go, a rule of action for them as for us.\r\n\r\nIn one of these memorials, it is stated, that arms and military\r\naccoutrements are now buying up by a French agent in this country, with\r\nan intent to export them to France. We have answered, &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother of these memorials complains that the consul of France at\r\nCharleston, has condemned as legal prize, a British vessel captured by\r\na French frigate, observing that this judicial act is not warranted by\r\nthe usage of nations nor by the stipulations existing between the United\r\nStates and France. It is true, &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur information is not perfect on the subject matter of another of these\r\nmemorials, which states that a vessel has been fitted out at Charleston,\r\nmanned there, and partly too with citizens of the United States, received\r\na commission there to cruise against nations at peace with us, and\r\nhas taken and sent a British vessel into this port. Without taking all\r\nthese facts for granted, we have not hesitated to express our highest\r\ndisapprobation of the conduct of any of our citizens who may personally\r\nengage in committing hostilities at sea against any of the nations,\r\nparties to the present war, and to declare, that if the case has happened,\r\nor that should it happen, we will exert all the measures with which the\r\nlaws and Constitution have armed us, to discover such offenders and bring\r\nthem to condign punishment. And that the like conduct shall be observed,\r\nshould the like enterprises be attempted against your nation, I am\r\nauthorized to give you the most unreserved assurances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe capture of the British ship Grange, by the French frigate l'Embuscade,\r\nwithin the Delaware, has been the subject of a former letter to you. On\r\nfull and mature consideration, the government deems the capture to have\r\nbeen unquestionably within its jurisdiction, and that according to the\r\nrules of neutrality and the protection it owes to all persons while within\r\nits limits, it is bound to see that the crew be liberated, and the vessel\r\nand cargo restored to their former owners. The Attorney General of the\r\nUnited States has made a statement of the grounds of this determination,\r\na copy of which I have the honor to enclose you. I am, in consequence,\r\ncharged by the President of the United States to express to you his\r\nexpectation, and at the same time his confidence, that you will be pleased\r\nto take immediate and effectual measures for having the ship Grange and\r\nher cargo restored to the British owners, and the persons taken on board\r\nher set at liberty.\r\n\r\nI am persuaded, Sir, you will be sensible, on mature consideration, that\r\nin forming these determinations, the government of the United States has\r\nlistened to nothing but the dictates of immutable justice; they consider\r\nthe rigorous exercise of that virtue as the surest means of preserving\r\nperfect harmony between the United States and the powers at war.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of great respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n     [25] [The parts of this letter which are mere repetitions of what is\r\n     contained in the preceding, to the British minister, are omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                Philadelphia, May 19, 1793.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI dare say you will have judged from the pusillanimity of the\r\nproclamation, from whose pen it came. A fear lest any affection should be\r\ndiscovered is distinguishable enough. This base fear will produce the very\r\nevil they wish to avoid. For our constituents seeing that the government\r\ndoes not express their mind, perhaps rather leans the other way, are\r\ncoming forward to express it themselves. It was suspected that there was\r\nnot a clear mind in the P's counsellors to receive Genet. The citizens,\r\nhowever, determined to receive him. Arrangements taken for meeting him at\r\nGray's Ferry in a great body. He escaped that by arriving in town with the\r\nletters which brought information that he was on the road. The merchants,\r\n_i. e._ Fitzsimmons & Co., were to present an address to _the P._ on the\r\nneutrality proclaimed. It contained much wisdom, but no affection. You\r\nwill see it in the papers enclosed. The citizens are determined to address\r\n_Genet_. Rittenhouse, Hutcheson, Dallas, Sargeant, &c., were at the head\r\nof it. Though a select body of only thirty was appointed to present it,\r\nyet a vast concourse of people attended him. I have not seen it; but it is\r\nunderstood to be the counter address. Ternant's hopes of employment in the\r\nFrench army turn out to be without grounds. He is told by the Minister of\r\nWar expressly that the places of Marechal de Camp are all full. He thinks\r\nit more prudent, therefore, to remain in America. He delivered yesterday\r\nhis letters of recall, and Mr. Genet presented his of credence. It is\r\nimpossible for anything to be more affectionate, more magnanimous than\r\nthe purport of his mission. We know that under present circumstances we\r\nhave a right to call upon you for the guarantee of our islands. But we do\r\nnot desire it. We wish you to do nothing but what is for your own good,\r\nand we will do all in our power to promote it. Cherish your own peace and\r\nprosperity. You have expressed a willingness to enter into a more liberal\r\ntreaty of commerce with us; I bring full powers (and he produced them) to\r\nform such a treaty, and a preliminary decree of the National Convention to\r\nlay open our country and its colonies to you for every purpose of utility,\r\nwithout your participating the burthens of maintaining and defending them.\r\nWe see in you the only person on earth who can love us sincerely, and\r\nmerit to be so loved. In short, he offers everything, and asks nothing.\r\nYet I know the offers will be opposed, and suspect they will not be\r\naccepted. In short, my dear Sir, it is impossible for you to conceive what\r\nis passing in our conclave; and it is evident that one or two, at least,\r\nunder pretence of avoiding war on the one side, have no great antipathy\r\nto run foul of it on the other, and to make a part in the confederacy of\r\nprinces against human liberty. The people in the western parts of this\r\nState have been to the excise officer, and threatened to burn his house,\r\n&c. They were blackened and otherwise disguised, so as to be unknown.\r\nHe has resigned, and H. says there is no possibility of getting the law\r\nexecuted there, and that probably the evil will spread. A proclamation is\r\nto be issued, and another instance of my being forced to appear to approve\r\nwhat I have condemned uniformly from its first conception.\r\n\r\nI expect every day to receive from Mr. Pinckney the model of the Scotch\r\nthreshing machine. It was to have come in a ship which arrived three weeks\r\nago, but the workman had not quite finished it. Mr. P. writes me word\r\nthat the machine from which my model is taken, threshes eight quarters\r\n(sixty-four bushels) of oats _an hour_, with four horses and four men. I\r\nhope to get it in time to have one erected at Monticello to clean out the\r\npresent crop. I enclose you the pamphlet you desired. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n                                                Philadelphia, May 21, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have been duly honored with your favor of May the 8th, covering\r\nthe letter of Mr. Newton, and that of May the 13th, with the letter of\r\nthe British Consul at Norfolk and the information of Henry Tucker, all of\r\nwhich have been laid before the President.\r\n\r\nThe putting the several harbors of the United States into a state of\r\ndefence, having never yet been the subject of deliberation and decision\r\nwith the Legislature, and consequently, the necessary moneys not having\r\nbeen appropriated or levied, the President does not find himself in a\r\nsituation competent to comply with the proposition on the subject of\r\nNorfolk.\r\n\r\nMr. Newton supposes, that by the treaties with France and Holland,\r\nthose powers are authorized to arm vessels within our ports. A careful\r\nexamination of the treaties will show, however, that no such permission\r\nhas been stipulated therein. Measures are accordingly taken to correct\r\nthis error as to the past, and others will be taken to prevent a\r\nrepetition of it. Proceedings are ordered against Mr. Hooper and other\r\nAmerican citizens who have participated in any hostilities against\r\nnations at peace with the United States, and circular instructions\r\nare given to the District Attorneys of the United States, to institute\r\nlike prosecutions in all future similar cases. The bringing vessels to,\r\nof whatever nation, while within the limits of the protection of the\r\nUnited States, will be pointedly forbidden; the government being firmly\r\ndetermined to enforce a peaceable demeanor among all the parties within\r\nthose limits, and to deal to all the same impartial measure.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect respect, your Excellency's\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. VAN BERCKEL.\r\n\r\n                                                Philadelphia, May 29, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--I am favored with your note of the 22d instant, stating that under\r\ncircumstances of invasion and urgent danger, their High Mightinesses,\r\nthe States General of the United Netherlands, had found it necessary to\r\nlay an embargo on all vessels in their ports; and that an American ship,\r\nthe Hope, being involved in this general order, the master had claimed\r\nan exemption under the eighth article of our treaty, which it had been\r\nnecessary to refuse him.\r\n\r\nI have laid this note before the President of the United States, and\r\nhave it in charge from him to assure you, that the United States having\r\nthe utmost confidence in the sincerity and good faith with which their\r\nHigh Mightinesses will observe the treaty between the two countries,\r\nfeel no dissatisfaction at the circumstance mentioned in your note. They\r\nare sensible that in human affairs, there are moments of difficulty and\r\nnecessity, to which it is the office of friendship to accommodate its\r\nstrict rights.\r\n\r\nThe President considers the explanation, which their High Mightinesses\r\nhave instructed you to give of this incident, as a proof of their desire\r\nto cultivate harmony and good understanding with these United States,\r\nand charges me to assure you that he has nothing more at heart than to\r\nconvince their High Mightinesses of the same amicable sentiments on the\r\npart of this country, and of the certainty with which they may count on\r\nits justice and friendship on every occasion.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. CARMICHAEL AND SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                                Philadelphia, May 31, 1793.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--In my letters of October the 14th and November the 3d, 1792,\r\nI communicated to you papers and observations on the conduct of the\r\nSpanish officers on our south-western frontier, and particularly of the\r\nBaron de Carondelet, the Governor of New Orleans. These made it evident\r\nthat he had industriously excited the southern Indians to war against us,\r\nand had furnished them with arms and ammunition in abundance, for that\r\nexpress purpose. We placed this under the view of the commissioners of\r\nSpain here, who undertook to communicate it to their court, and also to\r\nwrite on the subject to the Baron de Carondelet. They have lately made us\r\ncommunications from both these quarters; the aspect of which, however,\r\nis by no means such as to remove the causes of our dissatisfaction. I\r\nsend you these communications, consisting of treaties between Spain, the\r\nCreeks, Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Cherokees, handed us by express order\r\nfrom their court, a speech of Baron de Carondelet to the Cherokees, and\r\na letter from Messrs. de Viar and Jaudenes, covering that speech, and\r\ncontaining in itself very serious matter.\r\n\r\nI will first observe to you, that the question stated in that letter to\r\nhave been proposed to the Cherokees, what part they would take, in the\r\nevent of a war between the United States and Spain? was never proposed by\r\nauthority from this government. Its instructions to its agents have, on\r\nthe contrary, been explicitly to cultivate, with good faith, the peace\r\nbetween Spain and the Indians; and from the known prudence and good\r\nconduct of Governor Blount, to whom it is imputed, it is not believed to\r\nhave been proposed by him. This proposition then, you are authorized to\r\ndisavow to the court of Madrid, in the most unequivocal terms.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the treaties, the speech and the letter, you will see that\r\nthey undertake to espouse the concerns of Indians within our limits; to be\r\nmediators of boundary between them and us; to guarantee that boundary to\r\nthem; to support them with their whole power; and hazard to us intimations\r\nof acquiescence to avoid disagreeable results. They even propose to extend\r\ntheir intermeddlings to the northern Indians. These are pretensions so\r\ntotally inconsistent with the usages established among the white nations,\r\nwith respect to Indians living within their several limits, that it\r\nis believed no example of them can be produced, in times of peace; and\r\nthey are presented to us in a manner which we cannot deem friendly. The\r\nconsequence is, that the Indians, and particularly the Creeks, finding\r\nthemselves so encouraged, have passed, without the least provocation on\r\nour part, from a state of peace, which appeared to be well settled, to\r\nthat of serious hostility. Their murders and depredations, which, for\r\nsome months, we were willing to hope were only individual aggressions,\r\nnow assume the appearance of unequivocal war. Yet such is our desire\r\nof courting and cultivating the peace of all our Indian neighbors, that\r\ninstead of marching at once into their country and taking satisfaction\r\nourselves, we are peaceably requiring punishment of the individual\r\naggressors; and, in the meantime, are holding ourselves entirely on the\r\ndefensive. But this state of things cannot continue. Our citizens are\r\nentitled to effectual protection, and defensive measures are, at the same\r\ntime, the most expensive and least effectual. If we find then, that peace\r\ncannot be obtained by the temperate means we are still pursuing, we must\r\nproceed to those which are extreme, and meet all the consequences, of\r\nwhatever nature, or from whatever quarter they may be. We have certainly\r\nbeen always desirous to avoid whatever might disturb our harmony with\r\nSpain. We should be still more so, at a moment when we see that nation\r\nmaking part of so powerful a confederacy as is formed in Europe, and under\r\nparticular good understanding with England, our other neighbor. In so\r\ndelicate a position, therefore, instead of expressing our sense of these\r\nthings, by way of answer to Messrs. Viar and Jaudenes, the President has\r\nthought it better that it should be done to you, and to trust to your\r\ndiscretion the moment, the measure, and the form of communicating it\r\nto the court of Madrid. The actual state of Europe at the time you will\r\nreceive this, the solidity of the confederacy, and especially as between\r\nSpain and England, the temper and views of the former, or of both, towards\r\nus, the state of your negotiation, are circumstances which will enable you\r\nbetter to decide how far it may be necessary to soften, or even perhaps\r\nto suppress, the expressions of our sentiments on this subject. To your\r\ndiscretion, therefore, it is committed by the President, to let the court\r\nof Spain see how impossible it is for us to submit with folded arms to\r\nbe butchered by these savages, and to prepare them to view, with a just\r\neye, the more vigorous measures we must pursue to put an end to their\r\natrocities, if the moderate ones we are now taking should fail of that\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nOur situation on other accounts and in other quarters, is critical. The\r\nPresident is, therefore, constantly anxious to know the state of things\r\nwith you, and I entreat you to keep him constantly and well-informed.\r\nMr. Yznardi, the younger, lately appointed consul of the United States at\r\nCadiz, may be a convenient channel of forwarding your letters.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem and respect, Gentlemen, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                              June 2, 1793.\r\n\r\nI wrote you on the 27th ult. You have seen in the papers that some\r\nprivateers have been fitted out in Charleston by French citizens, with\r\ntheir own money, manned by themselves, and regularly commissioned by\r\ntheir nation. They have taken several prizes, and brought them into\r\nour ports. Some native citizens had joined them. These are arrested and\r\nunder prosecution, and orders are sent to all the ports to prevent the\r\nequipping privateers by any persons foreign or native. So far is right.\r\nBut the vessels so equipped at Charleston are ordered to leave the\r\nports of the United States. This I think was not right. Hammand demanded\r\nfurther surrender of the prizes they had taken. This is refused on the\r\nprinciple that by the laws of war the property is transferred to the\r\ncaptors. You will see in a paper I enclose, Dumourier's \"Address to his\r\nnation, and also Saxe Cobourg.\" I am glad to see a probability that the\r\nconstitution of 1791, would be the term at which the combined powers would\r\nstop. Consequently, that the re-establishment of that is the worst the\r\nFrench have to fear. I am also glad to see that the combiners adopt the\r\nslow process of nibbling at the strong posts on the frontiers. This will\r\ngive to France a great deal of time. The thing which gives me uneasiness\r\nis their internal combustion. This may by famine be rendered extreme.\r\nE. R. sets out the day after to-morrow for Virginia. I have no doubt\r\nhe is charged to bring back a faithful statement of the dispositions\r\nof that State. I wish therefore he may fall into hands which will not\r\ndeceive him. Have you time and the means of impressing Wilson Nicholas\r\n(who will be much with E. R.) with the necessity of giving him a strong\r\nand perfect understanding of the public mind? Considering that this\r\njourney may strengthen his nerves, and dispose him more favorably to the\r\npropositions of a treaty between the two republics, knowing that in this\r\nmoment the division on that question is 4 to 1, and that the last news has\r\nno tendency to proselyte any of the majority, I have myself proposed to\r\nrefer taking up the question till his return. There is too at this time\r\na lowering disposition perceivable both in England and Spain. The former\r\nkeeps herself aloof, and in a state of incommunication with us, except\r\nin the way of demand. The latter has not begun auspiciously with C. and\r\nS. at Madrid, and has lately sent 1,500 men to New Orleans, and greatly\r\nstrengthened her upper posts on the Mississippi. I think it more probable\r\nthan otherwise that Congress will be convened before the constitutional\r\nday. About the last of July this may be known. I should myself wish to\r\nkeep their meeting off to the beginning of October, if affairs will permit\r\nit. The invasion of the Creeks is what will most likely occasion its\r\nconvocation. You will see Mrs. House's death mentioned in the papers. She\r\nextinguished almost like a candle. I have not seen Mrs. Trist since, but\r\nI am told she means to give up the house immediately, and that she has\r\nsuffered great loss in her own fortune by exertions hitherto to support\r\nit. Browse is not returned, nor has been heard of for some time. Bartram\r\nis extremely anxious to get a large supply of seeds of the Kentucky\r\ncoffee tree. I told him I would use all my interest with you to obtain\r\nit, as I think I heard you say that some neighbors of yours had a large\r\nnumber of trees. Be so good as to take measures for bringing a good\r\nquantity, if possible, to Bartram when you come to Congress. Adieu. Yours\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n                                                Philadelphia, June 2, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of yours of May 16th, with\r\nthe information always pleasing of your being all well. In addition to\r\nthe news which you will see in the papers, we now have the certainty\r\nof Dumourier's operation. He had proposed an armistice to the Prince\r\nof Saxe Cobourg, which was agreed to on condition of his withdrawing\r\nhis troops from the Netherlands. He did so; it was then agreed that he\r\nshould march with his army (on whom he thought he could rely) to Paris,\r\nand re-establish the constitution of 1791. On which Cobourg stipulated\r\npeace on the part of the Emperor and K. of Prussia. Dumourier's army knew\r\nnothing of this. He made them believe the deputies sent from the National\r\nAssembly were to arrest and carry him to Paris to be tried for his defeat\r\nof the 18th to the 22d of March. They considered this as an injury to\r\nthemselves, and really loved and confided in him. They set out with him,\r\nbut very soon began to suspect his purpose was to overset the republic,\r\nand set up a king. They began to drop off in parties, and at length in a\r\nbody refused to go further. On this he fled with two regiments of horse,\r\nmostly foreigners, to the Austrians. His Saxe Cobourg's address to the\r\nFrench nation prove all this. Hostilities recommenced; and the combiners\r\nhave determined not to attempt to march to Paris, as the last year, but\r\nto take all the strong places on the frontier. This will at least give\r\ntime to the republic. The first thing to be feared for them is famine.\r\nThis will infallibly produce anarchy. Indeed, that joined to a draught of\r\nsoldiers, has already produced some serious insurrections. It is still\r\na comfort to see by the address of Dumourier and Saxe Cobourg that the\r\nconstitution of 1791 is the worst thing which is to be forced on the\r\nFrench. But even the falling back to that would give wonderful vigor to\r\nour monocrats, and unquestionably affect the tone of administering our\r\ngovernment. Indeed, I fear that if this summer should prove disastrous\r\nto the French, it will damp that energy of republicanism in our new\r\nCongress, from which I had hoped so much reformation. We have had here\r\nfor a considerable time past true winter weather, quite cold enough for\r\nwhite frost. Though that accident has not happened, fires are still kept\r\nup, having been intermitted only for short intervals of very hot weather.\r\nI have not yet received my model of the threshing mill. I wish it may come\r\nin time for the present crop; after so mild a winter as the last we must\r\nexpect weavil. My love to my dear Martha, and kiss the little ones for\r\nme. Adieu my dear Sir. Yours with constant affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. GENET, MINISTER PLENIPOTENTIARY OF FRANCE.\r\n\r\n                                                Philadelphia, June 5, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--In my letter of May the 15th, to M. de Ternant, your predecessor,\r\nafter stating the answer which had been given to the several memorials of\r\nthe British minister, of May the 8th, it was observed that a part still\r\nremained unanswered of that which respected the fitting out of armed\r\nvessels in Charleston, to cruise against nations with whom we were at\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nIn a conversation which I had afterwards the honor of holding with you,\r\nI observed that one of those armed vessels, the citizen Genet, had come\r\ninto this port with a prize; that the President had thereupon taken\r\nthe case into further consideration, and after mature consultation and\r\ndeliberation, was of opinion, that the arming and equipping vessels in\r\nthe ports of the United States to cruise against nations with whom they\r\nare at peace, was incompatible with the territorial sovereignty of the\r\nUnited States; that it made them instrumental to the annoyance of those\r\nnations, and thereby tended to compromit their peace; and that he thought\r\nit necessary as an evidence of good faith to them, as well as a proper\r\nreparation to the sovereignty of the country, that the armed vessels of\r\nthis description should depart from the ports of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe letter of the 27th instant, with which you have honored me, has\r\nbeen laid before the President, and that part of it which contains your\r\nobservations on this subject has been particularly attended to. The\r\nrespect due to whatever comes from you, friendship for the French nation,\r\nand justice to all, have induced him to re-examine the subject, and\r\nparticularly to give your representations thereon, the consideration they\r\ndeservedly claim. After fully weighing again, however, all the principles\r\nand circumstances of the case, the result appears still to be, that it is\r\nthe _right_ of every nation to prohibit acts of sovereignty from being\r\nexercised by any other within its limits; and the _duty_ of a neutral\r\nnation to prohibit such as would injure one of the warring powers; that\r\nthe granting military commissions within the United States by any other\r\nauthority than their own, it is an infringement on their sovereignty, and\r\nparticularly so when granted to their own citizens to lead them to acts\r\ncontrary to the duties they owe their own country; that the departure\r\nof vessels thus illegally equipped from the ports of the United States,\r\nwill be but an acknowledgment of respect analogous to the breach of it,\r\nwhile it is necessary on their part, as an evidence of their faithful\r\nneutrality. On these considerations, Sir, the President thinks that the\r\nUnited States owe it to themselves and to the nations in their friendship,\r\nto expect this act of reparation on the part of vessels, marked in their\r\nvery equipment with offence to the laws of the land, of which the laws of\r\nnations makes an integral part.\r\n\r\nThe expressions of friendly sentiments which we have already had the\r\nsatisfaction of receiving from you, leave no room to doubt that the\r\nconclusion of the President being thus made known to you, these vessels\r\nwill be permitted to give no further umbrage by their presence in the\r\nports of the United States.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of perfect esteem and respect,\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\n                                                Philadelphia, June 5, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--In the letter which I had the honor of writing you on the 15th\r\nof May, in answer to your several memorials of the 8th of that month, I\r\nmentioned that the President reserved for further consideration, a part\r\nof the one which related to the equipment of two privateers in the port\r\nof Charleston. The part alluded to, was that wherein you express your\r\nconfidence that the executive government of the United States would pursue\r\nmeasures for repressing such practices in future, and for restoring to\r\ntheir rightful owners any captures, which such privateers might bring into\r\nthe ports of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe President, after a full investigation of this subject and the most\r\nmature consideration, has charged me to communicate to you, that the first\r\npart of this application is found to be just, and that effectual measures\r\nare taken for preventing repetitions of the act therein complained of; but\r\nthat the latter part, desiring restitution of the prizes, is understood\r\nto be inconsistent with the rules which govern such cases, and would,\r\ntherefore, be unjustifiable towards the other party.\r\n\r\nThe principal agents in this transaction were French citizens. Being\r\nwithin the United States at the moment a war broke out between their own\r\nand another country, they determine to go into its defence; they purchase,\r\nthey arm and equip a vessel with their own money, man it themselves,\r\nreceive a regular commission from their nation, depart out of the\r\nUnited States, and then commence hostilities by capturing a vessel. If,\r\nunder these circumstances, the commission of the captors was valid, the\r\nproperty, according to the laws of war, was by the capture transferred to\r\nthem, and it would be an aggression on their nation, for the United States\r\nto rescue it from them, whether on the high seas or on coming into their\r\nports. If the commission was not valid, and, consequently, the property\r\nnot transferred by the laws of war to the captors, then the case would\r\nhave been cognizable in our courts of admiralty, and the owners might\r\nhave gone thither for redress. So that on neither supposition, would the\r\nexecutive be justifiable in interposing.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the United States, the transaction can be in nowise\r\nimputed to them. It was the first moment of the war, in one of their most\r\ndistant ports, before measures could be provided by the government to meet\r\nall the cases which such a state of things was to produce, impossible to\r\nhave been known, and therefore, impossible to have been prevented by that\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe moment it was known, the most energetic orders were sent to every\r\nState and port of the Union, to prevent a repetition of the accident.\r\nOn a suggestion that citizens of the United States had taken part in\r\nthe act, one, who was designated, was instantly committed to prison,\r\nfor prosecution; one or two others have been since named, and committed\r\nin like manner; and should it appear that there were still others, no\r\nmeasures will be spared to bring them to justice. The President has even\r\ngone further. He has required, as a reparation of their breach of respect\r\nto the United States, that the vessels so armed and equipped, shall depart\r\nfrom our ports.\r\n\r\nYou will see, Sir, in these proceedings of the President, unequivocal\r\nproofs of the line of strict right which he means to pursue. The measures\r\nnow mentioned, are taken in justice to the one party; the ulterior\r\nmeasure, of seizing and restoring the prizes, is declined in justice to\r\nthe other; and the evil, thus early arrested, will be of very limited\r\neffects; perhaps, indeed, soon disappear altogether.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                              June 6, 1793.\r\n\r\nI cannot but think that to decline the propositions of Mr. Genet on the\r\nsubject of our debt, without assigning any reason at all, would have a\r\nvery dry and unpleasant aspect indeed. We are then to examine what are our\r\ngood reasons for the refusal, which of them maybe spoken out, and which\r\nmay not. 1st. Want of confidence in the continuance of the present form of\r\ngovernment, and consequently that _advances_ to them might commit us with\r\ntheir successors. This cannot be spoken out. 2d. Since they propose to\r\ntake the debt in produce, it would be better for us that it should be done\r\nin moderate masses yearly, than all in one year. This cannot be professed.\r\n3d. When M. de Calonne was Minister of Finance, a Dutch company proposed\r\nto buy up the whole of our debt, by dividing it into actions or shares.\r\nI think Mr. Claviere, now Minister of Finance, was their agent. It was\r\nobserved to M. de Calonne, that to create such a mass of American paper,\r\ndivide it into shares, and let them deluge the market, would depreciate\r\nthe rest of our paper, and our credit in general; that the credit of a\r\nnation was a delicate and important thing, and should not be risked on\r\nsuch an operation. M. de Calonne, sensible of the injury of the operation\r\nto us, declined it. In May, 1791, there came, through Mr. Otto, a similar\r\nproposition from Schweizer, Jeanneret & Co. We had a communication on\r\nthe subject from Mr. Short, urging this same reason strongly. It was\r\nreferred to the Secretary of the Treasury, who, in a letter to yourself,\r\nassigned the reasons against it, and these were communicated to Mr. Otto,\r\nwho acquiesced in them. This objection, then, having been sufficient to\r\ndecline the proposition twice before, and having been urged to the two\r\npreceding forms of government (the ancient and that of 1791), will not\r\nbe considered as founded in objections to the present form. 4th. The law\r\nallows the whole debt to be paid only on condition it can be done on terms\r\n_advantageous_ to the United States. The minister foresees this objection,\r\nand thinks he answers it by observing the _advantage_ which the payment in\r\n_produce_ will occasion. It would be easy to show that this was not the\r\nsort of advantage the Legislature meant, but a _lower rate of interest_.\r\n5th. I cannot but suppose that the Secretary of the Treasury, being much\r\nmore familiar than I am with the money operations of the Treasury, would,\r\non examination, be able to derive practical objections from them. We\r\npay to France but five per cent. The people of this country would never\r\nsubscribe their money for less than six. If, to remedy this, obligations\r\nat less than five per cent. were offered, and accepted by Genet, he must\r\npart with them immediately, at a considerable discount, to indemnify the\r\nloss of the one per cent., and at still greater discount to bring them\r\ndown to par with our present six per cent., so that the operation would\r\nbe equally disgraceful to us and losing to them, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nI think it very material myself to keep alive the friendly sentiments\r\nof that country, as far as can be done without risking war or double\r\npayment. If the instalments falling due this year can be advanced,\r\nwithout incurring those dangers, I should be for doing it. We now see by\r\nthe declaration of the Prince of Saxe Cobourg, on the part of Austria\r\nand Prussia, that the ultimate point they desire is to restore the\r\nconstitution of 1791. Were this even to be done before the pay days of\r\nthis year, there is no doubt in my mind but that that government (as\r\nrepublican as the present, except in the form of its Executive) would\r\nconfirm an advance so moderate in sum and time. I am sure the _nation_\r\nof France would never suffer their government to go to war _with us_ for\r\nsuch a _bagatelle_, and the more surely if that bagatelle shall have been\r\ngranted by us so as to _please_ and not to _displease_ the nation; so as\r\nto keep their affections engaged on our side. So that I should have no\r\nfear in advancing the instalments of this year at epochs convenient to the\r\nTreasury. But at any rate should be for assigning reasons for not changing\r\nthe form of the debt. These thoughts are very hastily thrown on paper, as\r\nwill be but too evident.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of sincere attachment and respect,\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                              June 9, 1793.\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your two favors of May 27th and\r\n29th, since the date of my last which was of the 2d instant. In that of\r\nthe 27th you say you must not make your final exit from public life till\r\nit will be marked with justifying circumstances which all good citizens\r\nwill respect, and to which your friends can appeal. To my fellow-citizens\r\nthe debt of service has been fully and faithfully paid. I acknowledge\r\nthat such a debt exists, that a tour of duty, in whatever line he can\r\nbe most useful to his country, is due from every individual. It is not\r\neasy perhaps to say of what length exactly this tour should be, but we\r\nmay safely say of what length it should not be. Not of our whole life,\r\nfor instance, for that would be to be born a slave--not even of a very\r\nlarge portion of it. I have now been in the public service four and\r\ntwenty years; one half of which has been spent in total occupation with\r\ntheir affairs, and absence from my own. I have served my tour then. No\r\npositive engagement, by word or deed, binds me to their further service.\r\nNo commitment of their interests in any enterprise by me requires that\r\nI should see them through it. I am pledged by no act which gives any\r\ntribunal a call upon me before I withdraw. Even my enemies do not pretend\r\nthis. I stand clear then of public right on all points--my friends I have\r\nnot committed. No circumstances have attended my passage from office to\r\noffice, which could lead them, and others through them, into deception\r\nas to the time I might remain, and particularly they and all have known\r\nwith what reluctance I engaged and have continued in the present one, and\r\nof my uniform determination to return from it at an early day. If the\r\npublic then has no claim on me, and my friends nothing to justify, the\r\ndecision will rest on my own feelings alone. There has been a time when\r\nthese were very different from what they are now; when perhaps the esteem\r\nof the world was of higher value in my eye than everything in it. But age,\r\nexperience and reflection preserving to that only its due value, have set\r\na higher on tranquillity. The motion of my blood no longer keeps time\r\nwith the tumult of the world. It leads me to seek for happiness in the\r\nlap and love of my family, in the society of my neighbors and my books,\r\nin the wholesome occupations of my farm and my affairs, in an interest\r\nor affection in every bud that opens, in every breath that blows around\r\nme, in an entire freedom of rest, of motion, of thought, owing account\r\nto myself alone of my hours and actions. What must be the principle of\r\nthat calculation which should balance against these the circumstances of\r\nmy present existence--worn down with labors from morning to night, and\r\nday to day; knowing them as fruitless to others as they are vexatious to\r\nmyself, committed singly in desperate and eternal contest against a host\r\nwho are systematically undermining the public liberty and prosperity, even\r\nthe rare hours of relaxation sacrificed to the society of persons in the\r\nsame intentions, of whose hatred I am conscious even in those moments of\r\nconviviality when the heart wishes most to open itself to the effusions\r\nof friendship and confidence, cut off from my family and friends, my\r\naffairs abandoned to chaos and derangement, in short, giving everything\r\nI love in exchange for everything I hate, and all this without a single\r\ngratification in possession or prospect, in present enjoyment or future\r\nwish. Indeed, my dear friend, duty being out of the question, inclination\r\ncuts off all argument, and so never let there be more between you and me,\r\non this subject.\r\n\r\nI enclose you some papers which have passed on the subject of a new town.\r\nYou will see by them that the paper Coryphæus is either undaunted or\r\ndesperate. I believe that the statement enclosed has secured a decision\r\nagainst his proposition. I dined yesterday in a company where Morris\r\nand Bingham were, and happened to sit between them. In the course of\r\na conversation after dinner, Morris made one of his warm declarations\r\nthat after the expiration of his present senatorial term, nothing on\r\nearth should ever engage him to serve again in any public capacity.\r\nHe did this with such solemnity as renders it impossible he should not\r\nbe in earnest. The President is not well. Little lingering fevers have\r\nbeen hanging about him for a week or ten days, and affected his looks\r\nmost remarkably. He is also extremely affected by the attacks made and\r\nkept up on him in the public papers. I think he feels those things more\r\nthan any person I ever yet met with. I am sincerely sorry to see them.\r\nI remember an observation of yours, made when I first went to New York,\r\nthat the satellites and sycophants which surrounded him had wound up the\r\nceremonials of the government to a pitch of stateliness which nothing\r\nbut his personal character could have supported, and which no character\r\nafter him could ever maintain. It appears now that even his will be\r\ninsufficient to justify them in the appeal of the times to common sense\r\nas the arbiter of everything. Naked he would have been sanctimoniously\r\nreverenced; but enveloped in the rags of royalty, they can hardly be torn\r\noff without laceration. It is the more unfortunate that this attack is\r\nplanted on popular ground, on the love of the people to France and its\r\ncause, which is universal. Genet mentions freely enough in conversation\r\nthat France does not wish to involve us in the war by our guarantee. The\r\ninformation from St. Domingo and Martinique is, that those two islands\r\nare disposed and able to resist any attack which Great Britain can make\r\non them by land. A blockade would be dangerous, could it be maintained in\r\nthat climate for any length of time. I delivered to Genet your letter to\r\nRoland. As the latter is out of office, he will direct it to the minister\r\nof the Interior. I found every syllable of it strictly proper. Your\r\nploughs shall be duly attended to. Have you ever taken notice of Tull's\r\nhorse-houghing plough? I am persuaded that where you wish your work to\r\nbe very exact, and our great plough where a less degree will suffice,\r\nleave us nothing to wish for from other countries as to ploughs, under\r\nour circumstances. I have not yet received my threshing machine. I fear\r\nthe late, long, and heavy rains must have extended to us, and effected\r\nour wheat. Adieu. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, June 13, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--The insulated state in which France is placed with respect\r\nto almost all the world, by the present war, has cut off all means of\r\naddressing letters to you through other countries. I embrace the present\r\noccasion by a private individual going to France directly, to mention,\r\nthat since the date of my last public letter, which was April the 24th,\r\nand which covered the President's proclamation of April, I have received\r\nyour Nos. 17 to 24. M. de Ternant notified us of his recall on the 17th of\r\nMay, and delivered the letter of the Provisory Executive Council to that\r\neffect. I now enclose you the President's answer to the Council, which you\r\nwill be pleased to deliver; a copy of it is also enclosed, open, for your\r\ninformation. Mr. Genet delivered his credentials on the same day on which\r\nM. de Ternant took his leave, and was received by the President. He found\r\nhimself immediately immersed in business, the consequence of this war. The\r\nincidents to which that gives daily rise, and the questions respecting\r\nchiefly France and England, fills the executive with business, equally\r\ndelicate, difficult and disagreeable. The course intended to be pursued\r\nbeing that of a strict and impartial neutrality, decisions rendered by\r\nthe President rigorously on that principle, dissatisfy both parties, and\r\ndraw complaints from both. That you may have a proper idea of them, I\r\nenclose you copies of several memorials and letters, which have passed\r\nbetween the executive and the ministers of those two countries, which will\r\nat the same time develop the principles of the proceedings, and enable\r\nyou to satisfy them in your communications, should it be necessary. I\r\nenclose also the answer given to Mr. Genet, on a proposition from him\r\nto pay up the whole of the French debt at once. While it will enable you\r\nto explain the impracticability of the operation proposed, it may put it\r\nin your power to judge of the answer which would be given to any future\r\nproposition to that effect, and perhaps to prevent their being brought\r\nforward. The bill lately passed in England, prohibiting the business of\r\nthis country with France from passing through the medium of England, is a\r\ntemporary embarrassment to our commerce, from the unhappy predicament of\r\nits all hanging on the pivot of London. It will be happy for us, should it\r\nbe continued till our merchants may establish connections in the countries\r\nin which our produce is consumed, and to which it should go directly.\r\n\r\nOur commissioners have proceeded to the treaty with the northwestern\r\nIndians. They write, however, that the treaty will be a month later than\r\nwas expected. This delay, should it be extended, will endanger our losing\r\nthe benefit of our preparations for the campaign, and consequently bring\r\non a delicate question, whether these shall be relinquished for the\r\nresult of a treaty in which we never had any confidence? The Creeks have\r\nproceeded in their depredations till they assume the appearance of formal\r\nwar. It scarcely seems possible to avoid its becoming so. They are so\r\nstrong and so far from us, as to make very serious addition to our Indian\r\ndifficulties. It is very probable that some of the circumstances arising\r\nout of our affairs with the Indians, or with the belligerent powers of\r\nEurope, may occasion the convocation of Congress at an earlier day than\r\nthat to which its meeting stands at present.\r\n\r\nI send you the forms of the passports given here. The one in three\r\ncolumns is that now used; the other having been soon discontinued. It\r\nis determined that they shall be given in our own ports only, and to\r\nserve but for one voyage. It has also been determined, that they shall\r\nbe given to all vessels _bona fide_ owned by American citizens _wholly_,\r\nwhether built here or not. Our property, whether in the form of vessels,\r\ncargoes, or anything else, has a right to pass the seas untouched by\r\nany nation, by the law of nations; and no one has a right to ask where a\r\nvessel was built, but where is she owned? To the security which the law\r\nof nations gives to such vessels against all nations, are added particular\r\nstipulations with three of the belligerent powers. Had it not been in our\r\npower to enlarge our national stock of shipping suddenly in the present\r\nexigency, a great proportion of our produce must have remained on our\r\nhands for want of the means of transportation to market. At this time,\r\nindeed, a great proportion is in that predicament. The most rigorous\r\nmeasures will be taken to prevent any vessel, not wholly and _bona fide_\r\nowned by American citizens, from obtaining our passports. It is much our\r\ninterest to prevent the competition of other nations from taking from us\r\nthe benefits we have a right to expect from the neutrality of our flag;\r\nand I think we may be very sure that few, if any, will be fraudulently\r\nobtained within our ports.\r\n\r\nThough our spring has been cold and wet, yet the crops of small grain are\r\nas promising as they have ever been seen. The Hessian fly, however, to the\r\nnorth, and the weavil to the south of the Potomac, will probably abridge\r\nthe quantity. Still it seems very doubtful whether we shall not lose more\r\nfor want of the means of transportation, and I have no doubt that the\r\nships of Sweden and Denmark would find full employment here.\r\n\r\nWe shall endeavor to get your newspapers under the care of Major Reid,\r\nthe bearer of this letter.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, June 14, 1793.\r\n\r\nMy last letters to you have been of the 7th of May and 4th instant. Since\r\nthe last date, yours of April the 15th has come to hand.\r\n\r\nI enclose you several memorials and letters which have passed between\r\nthe Executive and the ministers of France and England. These will develop\r\nto you the principles on which we are proceeding between the belligerent\r\npowers. The decisions being founded in what is conceived to be rigorous\r\njustice, give dissatisfaction to both parties, and produce complaints\r\nfrom both. It is our duty, however, to persevere in them, and to meet\r\nthe consequences. You will observe that Mr. Hammond proposes to refer\r\nto his court the determination of the President, that the prizes taken\r\nby the Citoyen Genet, could not be given up. The reasons for this are\r\nexplained in the papers. Mr. Genet had stated that she was manned by\r\nFrench citizens. Mr. Hammond had not stated the contrary before the\r\ndecision. Neither produced any proofs. It was therefore supposed that\r\nshe was manned, principally, with French citizens. After the decision,\r\nMr. Hammond denies the fact, but without producing any proof. I am really\r\nunable to say how it was; but I believe it to be certain there were very\r\nfew Americans. He says, the issuing the commission, &c., by Mr. Genet,\r\nwithin our territory, was an infringement of our sovereignty; therefore,\r\nthe proceeds of it should be given up to Great Britain. The infringement\r\nwas a matter between France and us. Had we insisted on any penalty or\r\nforfeiture by way of satisfaction to our insulted rights, it would have\r\nbelonged to us, not to a third party. As between Great Britain and us,\r\nconsidering all the circumstances explained in the papers, we deemed\r\nwe did enough to satisfy her. We are, moreover, assured, that it is the\r\nstanding usage of France, perhaps too of other nations in all wars, to\r\nlodge blank commissions with all their foreign consuls, to be given to\r\nevery vessel of their nation, merchant or armed; without which a merchant\r\nvessel would be punished as a pirate, were she to take the smallest\r\nthing of the enemy that should fall in her way. Indeed, the place of the\r\ndelivery of a commission is immaterial. As it may be sent by letter to\r\nany one, so it may be delivered by hand to him anywhere. The place of\r\n_signature by the Sovereign_ is the material thing. Were that to be done\r\nin any other jurisdiction than his own, it might draw the validity of\r\nthe act into question. I mention these things, because I think it would\r\nbe proper, that after considering them and such other circumstances as\r\nappear in the papers, or may occur to yourself, you should make it the\r\nsubject of a conversation with the minister. Perhaps it may give you an\r\nopportunity of touching on another subject. Whenever Mr. Hammond applies\r\nto our government on any matter whatever, be it ever so new or difficult,\r\nif he does not receive his answer in two or three days or a week, we are\r\ngoaded with new letters on the subject. Sometimes it is the sailing of\r\nthe packet, which is made the pretext for forcing us into premature and\r\nundigested determinations. You know best how far your applications meet\r\nsuch early attentions, and whether you may with propriety claim a return\r\nof them; you can best judge, too, of the expediency of an intimation, that\r\nwhere despatch is not reciprocal, it may be expedient and justifiable that\r\ndelay should be so.\r\n\r\nOur Commissioners have set out for the place of treaty with the North\r\nWestern Indians. They have learned on their arrival at Niagara that\r\nthe treaty will be a month later than was expected. Should further\r\nprocrastination take place, it may wear the appearance of being intended\r\nto make us lose the present campaign, for which all our preparations are\r\nmade. We have had little expectations of any favorable result from the\r\ntreaty; and whether for such a prospect we should give up a campaign,\r\nwill be a disagreeable question. The Creeks have proceeded in their\r\ndepredations and murder till they assume the appearance of unequivocal\r\nwar. It scarcely seems possible to avoid its becoming so. It is very\r\npossible that our affairs with the Indians or with the belligerent powers\r\nof Europe, may occasion the convocation of Congress at an earlier day than\r\nthat to which its meeting stands at present.\r\n\r\nThough our spring has been cold and wet, yet the crops of small grain\r\nare as promising as could be desired. They will suffer, however, by the\r\nHessian fly to the north and the weavil to the south of the Patowmac.\r\n\r\nMy letter of the 4th instant was written to go by the Packet, but hearing\r\nbefore its departure that Major Jackson was to go in a few days by a\r\nprivate vessel, it was committed to him, as is also the present letter.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. GENET.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, June 17, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have received and laid before the President your letter of the\r\n14th instant, stating that certain judiciary officers of the United\r\nStates, contrary to the laws of nations, and the treaties subsisting\r\nbetween France and the United States, had arrested certain vessels and\r\ncargoes taken by a French armed vessel and brought into this port, and\r\ndesiring that the authority of the President might be interposed to\r\nrestore the prizes with the damages for their detention.\r\n\r\nBy the laws of this country every individual claiming a right to any\r\narticle of property, may demand process from a court of justice, and\r\ndecision on the validity of his claim. This is understood to be the case,\r\nwhich is the subject of your letter. Individuals claiming a right to the\r\nprizes, have attached them by process from the Court of Admiralty, which\r\nthat Court was not free to deny, because justice is to be denied to no\r\nman. If, at the hearing of the cause, it shall be found that it is not\r\ncognizable before that Court, you may so far rely on its learning and\r\nintegrity as to be assured it will so pronounce itself. In like manner,\r\nif having jurisdiction of the causes, it shall find the rights of the\r\nclaimants to be null, be assured it will pronounce that nullity, and in\r\neither case the property will be restored, but whether with damages or\r\nnot, the Court alone is to decide. It happens in this particular case that\r\nthe rule of decision will be not the municipal laws of the United States\r\nbut the law of nations, and the law maritime, as admitted and practised\r\nin all civilized countries, that the same sentence will be pronounced\r\nhere, that would be pronounced in the Republic of France, or in any other\r\ncountry of Europe; and that if it should be unfavorable to the captors,\r\nit will be for reasons understood and acknowledged in your own country,\r\nand for the justice of which we might safely appeal to the jurists of your\r\nown country. I will add, that if the seizure should be found contrary to\r\nthe treaties subsisting between France and the United States, the judges\r\nwill consider these treaties as constituting a conventional law for the\r\ntwo nations, controlling all other laws, and will decree accordingly. The\r\nfunctions of the Executive are not competent to the decision of questions\r\nof property between individuals. These are ascribed to the judiciary\r\nalone, and when either persons or property are taken into their custody,\r\nthere is no power in this country that can take them out. You will,\r\ntherefore, be sensible, Sir, that though the President is not the organ\r\nfor doing what is just in the present case, it will be effectually done\r\nby those to whom the Constitution has ascribed the duty, and be assured\r\nthat the interests, the rights and the dignity of the French nation will\r\nreceive within the bosom of the United States all the support which a\r\nfriendly nation could desire, and a natural one yield.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of great respect and esteem, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GENET.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, June 17, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--I shall now have the honor of answering your letter of the 1st\r\ninstant, and so much of that of the 14th (both of which have been laid\r\nbefore the President) as relates to a vessel armed in the port of New York\r\nand about to depart from thence, but stopped by order of the Government.\r\nAnd here I beg leave to premise, that the case supposed in your letter,\r\nof a vessel arming for her own defence, and to repel unjust aggressions,\r\nis not that in question, nor that on which I mean to answer, because not\r\nhaving yet happened, as far as is known to the Government, I have no\r\ninstructions on the subject. The case in question is that of a vessel\r\narmed, equipped, and manned in a port of the United States, for the\r\npurpose of committing hostilities on nations at peace with the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was perceived that such enterprises would be attempted,\r\norders to prevent them were despatched to all the States and ports of\r\nthe Union. In consequence of these, the Governor of New York, receiving\r\ninformation that a sloop heretofore called the Polly, now the Republican,\r\nwas fitting out, arming, and manning in the port of New York, for the\r\nexpress and sole purpose of cruising against certain nations with whom\r\nwe are at peace, that she had taken her guns and ammunition aboard, and\r\nwas on the point of departure, seized the vessel. That the Governor was\r\nnot mistaken in the previous indications of her object, appears by the\r\nsubsequent avowal of the citizen Hauterieve, consul of France at that\r\nport, who, in a letter to the Governor, reclaims her as \"Un vaisseau\r\narmé en guerre, et pret à mettre à la voile;\" and describes her object\r\nin these expressions: \"Cet usage etrange de la force publique contre les\r\ncitoyens d'une nation amie qui se reunissent ici _pour aller defendre\r\nleur freres_,\" &c.; and again: \"Je requiers, monsieur, l'autorité dont\r\nvous etes revetu, pour faire rendre à des Francois, à des alliés, &c.,\r\nla liberté _de voler au secours de leur patrie_.\" This transaction being\r\nreported to the President, orders were immediately sent to deliver over\r\nthe vessel, and the persons concerned in the enterprise, to the tribunals\r\nof the country, that if the act was of those forbidden by the law, it\r\nmight be punished; if it was not forbidden, it might be so declared, and\r\nall persons apprized of what they might or might not do.\r\n\r\nThis, we have reason to believe, is the true state of the case, and\r\nit is a repetition of that which was the subject of my letter of the\r\n5th instant, which animadverted, not merely on the single fact of the\r\ngranting commissions of war by one nation within the territory of another,\r\nbut on the aggregate of the facts; for it states the opinion of the\r\nPresident to be, \"that the arming and equipping vessels in the ports of\r\nthe United States, to cruise against nations with whom we are at peace,\r\nwas incompatible with the sovereignty of the United States; that it\r\nmade them instrumental to the annoyance of those nations, and thereby\r\ntended to commit their peace.\" And this opinion is still conceived to\r\nbe not contrary to the principles of natural law, the usage of nations,\r\nthe engagements which unite the two people, nor the proclamation of the\r\nPresident, as you seem to think.\r\n\r\nSurely, not a syllable can be found in the last-mentioned instrument,\r\npermitting the preparation of hostilities in the ports of the United\r\nStates. Its object was to enjoin on our citizens \"a friendly conduct\r\ntowards all the belligerent powers;\" but a preparation of hostilities is\r\nthe reverse of this.\r\n\r\nNone of the engagements in our treaties stipulate this permission. The\r\nXVIIth article of that of commerce, permits the armed vessels of either\r\nparty to enter the ports of the other, and to depart with their prizes\r\nfreely; but the entry of an armed vessel into a port, is one act; the\r\nequipping a vessel in that port, arming her, and manning her, is a\r\ndifferent one, and not engaged by any article of the treaty.\r\n\r\nYou think, Sir, that this opinion is also contrary to the law of nature\r\nand usage of nations. We are of opinion it is dictated by that law and\r\nusage; and this had been very maturely inquired into before it was adopted\r\nas a principle of conduct. But we will not assume the exclusive right\r\nof saying what that law and usage is. Let us appeal to enlightened and\r\ndisinterested judges. None is more so than Vattel. He says, L. 3. 8.\r\n104. \"Tant qu'un peuple neutre veut jouir surement de cet état, il doit\r\nmontrer en toutes choses une exacte impartialité entre ceux qui se font la\r\nguerre. Car s'il favorise l'un au préjudice de l'autre, il ne pourra pas\r\nse plaindre, quand celui ci le traitera comme adhérent et associé de son\r\nennemi. Sa neutralité seroit une neutralité frauduleuse, dont personne ne\r\nveut être la dupe. Voyons donc en quoi consiste cette impartialité qu'un\r\npeuple neutre doit garder.\r\n\r\n\"Elle se rapporte uniquement à la guerre, et comprend deux choses 1. Ne\r\npoint donner de secours quand on n'y est pas obligé; ne fournir librement\r\nne troupes, ni armes, ni munitions, ni rien de ce qui sert directement\r\nà la guerre. Je dis _ne point donner de secours_, et non pas _en donner\r\negalement_; car il seroit absurde qu'un etat secourut en même tems deux\r\nennemis. Et puis il seroit impossible de le faire avec egalité; les\r\nmêmes choses, le même nombre de troupes, la même quantitié d'armes, de\r\nmunitions, &c., fournies en des circonstances differentes, ne forment plus\r\ndes secours equivalents,\" &c. If the neutral power may not, consistent\r\nwith its neutrality, furnish men to either party, for their aid in war,\r\nas little can either enrol them in the neutral territory by the law of\r\nnations. Wolf, S. 1174, says, \"Puisque le droit de lever des soldats est\r\nun droit de majesté, qui ne peut être violé par une nation etrangere, il\r\nn'est pas permis de lever des soldats sur le territorie d'autrui, sans\r\nle consentement du mâitre du territorie.\" And Vattel, before cited, L.\r\n3. 8. 15. \"Le droit de lever des soldats appartenant uniquement à la\r\nnation, on au souverain, personne ne peut en envoler en pays etranger\r\nsans la permission du souveraine: Ceux qui entre prennant d'engager des\r\nsoldats en pays etranger sans la permission du souverain, et en general\r\nquiquonque debauche les sujets d'autrui, viole un des droits les plus\r\nsacrés du prince et de la nation. C'est le crime qu'on appelle _plagiat_,\r\nou vol d'homme. Il n'est aucun etat police qui ne le punisse très\r\nsévérement,\" &c. For I choose to refer you to the passage, rather than\r\nfollow it through all its developments. The testimony of these, and other\r\nwriters, on the law and usage of nations, with your own just reflections\r\non them, will satisfy you that the United States, in prohibiting all\r\nthe belligerent powers from equipping, arming, and manning vessels of\r\nwar in their ports, have exercised a right and a duty, with justice and\r\nwith great moderation. By our treaties with several of the belligerent\r\npowers, which are a part of the laws of our land, we have established a\r\nstate of peace with them. But, without appealing to treaties, we are at\r\npeace with them all by the law of nature. For by nature's law, man is at\r\npeace with man till some aggression is committed, which, by the same law,\r\nauthorizes one to destroy another as his enemy. For our citizens, then,\r\nto commit murders and depredations on the members of nations at peace\r\nwith us, or combine to do it, appeared to the Executive, and to those\r\nwith whom they consulted, as much against the laws of the land, as to\r\nmurder or rob, or combine to murder or rob its own citizens; and as much\r\nto require punishment, if done within their limits, where they have a\r\nterritorial jurisdiction, or on the high seas, where they have a personal\r\njurisdiction, that is to say, one which reaches their own citizens only,\r\nthis being an appropriate part of each nation on an element where all have\r\na common jurisdiction. So say our laws, as we understand them ourselves.\r\nTo them the appeal is made; and whether we have construed them well or\r\nill, the constitutional judges will decide. Till that decision shall be\r\nobtained, the government of the United States must pursue what they think\r\nright with firmness, as is their duty. On the first attempt that was made,\r\nthe President was desirous of involving in the censures of the law as few\r\nas might be. Such of the individuals only, therefore, as were citizens\r\nof the United States, were singled out for prosecution. But this second\r\nattempt being after full knowledge of what had been done on the first,\r\nand indicating a disposition to go on in opposition to the laws, they\r\nare to take their course against all persons concerned, whether citizens\r\nor aliens; the latter, while within our jurisdiction and enjoying the\r\nprotection of the laws, being bound to obedience to them, and to avoid\r\ndisturbances of our peace within, or acts which would commit it without,\r\nequally as citizens are. I have the honor to be, with sentiments of great\r\nrespect and esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\n                                               Philadelphia, June 19, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,--I had the honor to address you a letter on the 29th of May was\r\ntwelvemonth, on the articles still unexecuted of the treaty of peace\r\nbetween the two nations. The subject was extensive and important, and\r\ntherefore rendered a certain degree of delay in the reply to be expected.\r\nBut it has now become such as naturally to generate disquietude. The\r\ninterest we have in the western posts, the blood and treasure which their\r\ndetention costs us daily, cannot but produce a corresponding anxiety on\r\nour part. Permit me, therefore, to ask when I may expect the honor of a\r\nreply to my letter, and to assure you of the sentiments of respect with\r\nwhich I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                             June 23, 1793.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--My last was of the 17th, if I may reckon a single line\r\nanything. Yours of the 13th came to hand yesterday. The proclamation\r\nas first proposed was to have been a declaration of neutrality. It\r\nwas opposed on these grounds: 1. That a declaration of neutrality was\r\na declaration there should be no war, to which the Executive was not\r\ncompetent. 2. That it would be better to hold back the declaration of\r\nneutrality, as a thing worth something to the powers at war, that they\r\nwould bid for it, and we might reasonably ask a price, the _broadest\r\nprivileges_ of neutral nations. The first objection was so far respected\r\nas to avoid inserting the term _neutrality_, and the drawing the\r\ninstrument was left to E. R. That there should be a proclamation was\r\npassed unanimously with the approbation or the acquiescence of all\r\nparties. Indeed, it was not expedient to oppose it altogether, lest it\r\nshould prejudice what was the next question, the boldest and greatest\r\nthat ever was hazarded, and which would have called for extremities had it\r\nprevailed. Spain is unquestionably picking a quarrel with us. A series of\r\nletters from her commissioners here prove it. We are sending a courier to\r\nMadrid. The inevitableness of war with the Creeks, and the probability,\r\nI might say the certainty of it with Spain, (for there is not one of us\r\nwho doubts it,) will certainly occasion your convocation, at what time I\r\ncannot exactly say, but you should be prepared for this important change\r\nin the state of things. The President has got pretty well again; he\r\nsets off this day to Mount Vernon, and will be absent a fortnight. The\r\ndeath of his manager, hourly expected, of a consumption is the call; he\r\nwill consequently be absent on the 4th of July. He travels in a phaeton\r\nand pair. Doctor Logan sends you the enclosed pamphlet. Adieu. Yours\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX TO VOL.
