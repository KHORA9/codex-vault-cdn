He was not very often to be\r\nseen there nowadays; he bred and bought, but he no longer killed, and\r\nrarely sold, in person. These latter and lesser functions he left to his\r\ndeputy, Simpson, for he had gradually developed a bye-trade which took\r\nup much of his time, and was no less profitable than his ostensible\r\nbusiness. He bought horses, \"made\" them into hunters, and sold them\r\nagain. He was a rare judge and a fine rider, and his heart was in this\r\nline of work.\r\n\r\nHowever to-day he was in his shop because the Christmas beef was on\r\nshow. Here were splendid carcasses decked with blue rosettes, red\r\nrosettes, or cards of \"Honourable Mention;\" poor bodies sadly\r\nunconscious (as one may suppose all bodies are) of their posthumous\r\nglories. Jack Rock, a spruce spare little man with a thin red face and a\r\nget-up of the most \"horsy\" order, stood before them, expatiating to\r\nSimpson on their beauties. Simpson, who was as fat as his master was\r\nthin, and even redder in the face, chimed in; they were for all the\r\nworld like a couple of critics hymning the praise of poets who have paid\r\nthe debt of nature, but are decorated with the insignia of fame. Verily\r\nJack Rock's shop in the days before Christmas might well seem an Abbey\r\nor a Pantheon of beasts.\r\n\r\n\"Beef for me on Christmas Day,\" said Jack. \"None of your turkeys or\r\ngeese, or such-like truck. Beef!\" He pointed to a blue-rosetted carcass.\r\n\"Look at him; just look at him! I've known him since he was calved. Cuts\r\nup well, doesn't he? I'll have a joint off him for my own table,\r\nSimpson.\"\r\n\r\n\"You couldn't do better, sir,\" said Simpson, just touching, careful not\r\nto bruise, the object of eulogy with his professional knife. A train of\r\nthought started suddenly in his brain. \"Them vegetarians, sir!\" he\r\nexclaimed. Was it wonder, or contempt, or such sheer horror as the\r\ndevotee has for atheism? Or the depths of the first and the depths of\r\nthe second poured into the depths of the third to make immeasurable\r\nprofundity?\r\n\r\nA loud burst of laughter came from the door of the shop. Nothing\r\nstartled Jack Rock. He possessed in perfection a certain cheerful\r\nseriousness which often marks the amateurs of the horse. These men are\r\naccustomed to take chances, to encounter the unforeseen, to endure\r\ndisappointment, to withstand the temptations of high success. _Mens\r\nAequa!_ Life, though a pleasant thing, is not a laughing matter. So Jack\r\nturned slowly and gravely round to see whence the irreverent\r\ninterruption proceeded. But when he saw the intruder his face lit up,\r\nand he darted across the shop with outstretched hand. Simpson followed,\r\nhastily rubbing his right hand on the under side of his blue apron.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome, my lad, welcome home!\" cried Jack, as he greeted with a hard\r\nsqueeze a young man who stood in the doorway. \"First-rate you look too.\r\nHe's filled out, eh, Simpson?\" He tapped the young man's chest\r\nappreciatively, and surveyed his broad and massive shoulders with almost\r\nprofessional admiration. \"Canada's agreed with you, Andy. Have you just\r\ngot here?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I got here two hours ago. You were out, so I left my bag and went\r\nfor a walk round the old place. It seems funny to be in Meriton again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come into the office. We must drink your health. You too, Simpson. Come\r\nalong.\"\r\n\r\nHe led the way to a back room, where, amid more severe furniture and\r\nappliances, there stood a cask of beer. From this he filled three pint\r\nmugs, and Andy Hayes' health and safe return were duly honoured. Andy\r\nwinked his eye.\r\n\r\n\"Them teetotallers!\" he ejaculated, with a very fair imitation of\r\nSimpson, who acknowledged the effort with an answering wink as he\r\ndrained his mug and then left the other two to themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I've been poking about everywhere--first up to have a look at the\r\nold house. Not much changed there--well, except that everything's\r\nchanged by the dear old governor's not being there any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, it was a black Christmas that year--four years ago now. First, the\r\nold gentleman; then poor Nancy, a month later. She caught the fever\r\nnursin' him; she would do it, and I couldn't stop her. Did you go to the\r\nchurchyard, Andy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I went there.\" After a moment's grave pause his face brightened\r\nagain. \"And I went to the old school. Nobody there--it's holidays, of\r\ncourse--but how everything came back to me! There was my old seat,\r\nbetween Chinks and the Bird--you know? Wat Money, I mean, and young Tom\r\nDove.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they're both in the place still. Tom Dove's helpin' his father at\r\nthe Lion, and Wat Money's articled to old Mr. Foulkes the lawyer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I sat down at my old desk, and, by Jove, I absolutely seemed to hear\r\nthe old governor talking--talking about the Pentathlon. You've heard him\r\ntalk about the Pentathlon? He was awfully keen on the Pentathlon; wanted\r\nto have it at the sports. I believe he thought I should win it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't exactly remember what it was, but you'd have had a good go for\r\nit, Andy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leaping, running, wrestling, throwing the discus, hurling the spear--I\r\nthink that's right. He was talking about it the very last day I sat at\r\nthat desk--eight years ago! Yes, it's eight years since I went out to\r\nthe war, and nearly five since I went to Canada. And I've never been\r\nback! Well, except for not seeing him and Nancy again, I'm glad of it.\r\nI've done better out there. There wasn't any opening here. I wasn't\r\nclever, and if I had been, there was no money to send me to Oxford,\r\nthough the governor was always dreaming of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Naturally, seein' he was B.A. Oxon, and a gentleman himself,\" said\r\nJack.\r\n\r\nHe spoke in a tone of awe and admiration. Andy looked at him with a\r\nsmile. Among the townsfolk of Meriton Andy's father had always been\r\nlooked up to by reason of the letters after his name on the prospectus\r\nof the old grammar school, of which he had been for thirty years the\r\nhard-worked and very ill-paid headmaster. In Meriton eyes the letters\r\ncarried an academical distinction great if obscure, a social distinction\r\nequally great and far more definite. They ranked Mr. Hayes with the\r\ngentry, and their existence had made his second marriage--with Jack Rock\r\nthe butcher's sister--a _mesalliance_ of a pronounced order. Jack\r\nhimself was quite of this mind. He had always treated his brother-in-law\r\nwith profound respect; even his great affection for his sister had never\r\nquite persuaded him that she had not been guilty of gross presumption in\r\nwinning Mr. Hayes' heart. He could not, even as the second Mrs. Hayes'\r\nbrother, forget the first--Andy's mother; for she, though the gentlest\r\nof women, had always called Jack \"Butcher.\" True, that was in days\r\nbefore Jack had won his sporting celebrity and set up his private gig;\r\nbut none the less it would have seemed impossible to conceive of a\r\nfamily alliance--even a posthumous one--with a lady whose recognition of\r\nhim was so exclusively commercial.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm not a B.A.--Oxon. or otherwise,\" laughed Andy. \"I don't know\r\nwhether I'm a gentleman. If I am, so are you. Meriton Grammar School is\r\nresponsible for us both. And if you're in trade, so am I. What's the\r\ndifference between timber and meat?\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect there's a difference between Meriton and Canada, though,\" Jack\r\nRock opined shrewdly. \"Are you goin' to stay at home, or goin' back?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall stay here if I can develop the thing enough to make it pay to\r\nhave a man on this side. If not, pack up! But I shall be here for the\r\nnext six months anyway, I expect.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's it worth to you?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing much just now. Two hundred a year guaranteed, and a\r\ncommission--if it's earned. But it looks like improving. Only the orders\r\nmust come in before the commission does! However it's not so bad; I'm\r\nlucky to have found a berth at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, lucky thing you got pals with that Canadian fellow down in South\r\nAfrica.\"\r\n\r\n\"A real stroke of luck. It was a bit hard to make up my mind not to come\r\nhome with the boys, but I'm sure I did the right thing. Only I'm sorry\r\nabout the old governor and Nancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The old gentleman himself told me he thought you'd done right.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was an opening; and it had to be taken or left, then and there. So\r\nhere I am, and I'm going to start an office in London.\"\r\n\r\nJack Rock nodded thoughtfully; he seemed to be revolving something in\r\nhis mind. Andy's eyes rested affectionately on him. The two had been\r\ngreat friends all through Andy's boyhood. Jack had been \"Jack\" to him\r\nlong before he became a family connection, and \"Jack\" he had continued\r\nto be. As for the _mesalliance_--well, looking back, Andy could not with\r\ncandour deny that it had been a surprise, perhaps even a shock. It had\r\nto some degree robbed him of the exceptional position he held in the\r\ngrammar school, where, among the sons of tradesmen, he alone, or almost\r\nalone, enjoyed a vague yet real social prestige. The son shared the\r\nfather's fall. The feeling of caste is very persistent, even though it\r\nmay be shamed into silence by modern doctrines, or by an environment in\r\nwhich it is an alien plant. But he had got over his boyish feeling now,\r\nand was delighted to come back to Meriton as Jack Rock's visitor, and to\r\nstay with him at the comfortable little red-brick house adjoining the\r\nshop in High Street. In fact he flattered himself that his service in\r\nthe ranks and his Canadian experiences had taken the last of \"that sort\r\nof nonsense\" out of him. It was, perhaps, a little too soon to pronounce\r\nso confident a judgment.\r\n\r\nAndy was smitten with a sudden compunction. \"Why, I've never asked after\r\nHarry Belfield!\" he cried.\r\n\r\nHe was astonished at his own disloyalty. Harry Belfield had been the\r\nhero of his youth, his ideal, his touchstone of excellence in all\r\nthings, the standard by which he humbly measured his own sore\r\ndeficiencies, and contemptuously assessed the demerits of his\r\nschoolfellows. Of these Harry had not been one. No grammar school for\r\nhim! He was the son of Mr. Belfield of Halton Park--Harrow and Oxford\r\nwere the programme for him. The same favourable conditions gave him the\r\nopportunity--which, of course, he took--of excelling in all the\r\naccomplishments that Andy lacked and envied--riding, shooting, games of\r\nskill that cost money. The difference of position set a gulf between the\r\ntwo boys. Meetings had been rare events--to Andy always notable events,\r\noccasions of pleasure and of excitement, landmarks in memory. The\r\nacquaintance between the houses had been of the slightest. In Andy's\r\nearliest days Mr. and the first Mrs. Hayes had dined once a year with\r\nMr. and Mrs. Belfield; they were not expected to return the hospitality.\r\nAfter Andy's mother died and Nancy came on the scene, the annual dinner\r\nhad gone on, but it had become a men's dinner; and Mrs. Belfield, though\r\nshe bowed in the street, had not called on the second Mrs. Hayes--Nancy\r\nRock that had been. It was not to be expected. Yet Mr. Belfield had\r\nrecognized an equal in Andy's father; he also, perhaps, yielded some\r\nhomage to the B.A. Oxon. And Harry, though he undoubtedly drew a line\r\nbetween himself and Andy, drew another between Andy and Andy's\r\nschoolfellows, Chinks, the Bird, and the rest. He was rewarded--and to\r\nhis worship-loving nature it was a reward--by an adoration due as much,\r\nperhaps, to the first line as to the second. The more definite a line,\r\nthe more graciousness lies in stepping over it.\r\n\r\nThese boyish devotions are common, and commonly are short-lived. But\r\nAndy's habit of mind was stable and his affections tenacious. He still\r\nfelt that a meeting with Harry Belfield would be an event.\r\n\r\n\"He's all right,\" Jack Rock answered, his tone hardly responding to\r\nAndy's eagerness. \"He's a barrister now, you know; but I don't fancy he\r\ndoes much at it. Better at spendin' money than makin' it! If you want to\r\nsee him, you can do it to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I? How?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's talk of him bein' candidate for the Division next election, and\r\nhe's goin' to speak at a meeting in the Town Hall to-night, him and a\r\nchap in Parliament.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! Which side is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"You've been a good while away to ask that!\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I have. I say, Jack, let's go.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can go; I shan't,\" said Jack Rock. \"You'll get back in time for\r\nsupper--and need it too, I should say. I never listen to speeches except\r\nwhen they put me on a jury at assizes. Then I do like to hear a chap\r\nfight for his man. That's racin', that is; and I like specially, Andy,\r\nto see him bring it off when the odds are against him. But this\r\npolitics--in my opinion, if you put their names in a hat and drew 'em\r\nblindfolded, you'd get just as good a Gover'ment as you do now, or just\r\nas bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm not going for the politics. I'm going to hear Harry Belfield.\"\r\n\r\n\"The only question as particularly interests me,\" said Jack, with one of\r\nhis occasional lapses into doubtful grammar, \"is the matter of chilled\r\nmeat. But which of 'em does anything for me there? One says 'Free\r\nTrade--let it all come!' The other says, 'No chilled meat, certainly\r\nnot, unless it comes from British possessions'--which is where it does\r\ncome from mostly. And it's ruin to the meat, Andy, in my opinion. I hate\r\nto see it. Not that I lose much by it, havin' a high-class connection.\r\nWould you like to have another look in the shop?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we say to-morrow morning?\" laughed Andy.\r\n\r\nJack shook his head; he seemed disappointed at this lack of enthusiasm.\r\n\"I've got some beauties this Christmas,\" he said. \"All the same I shan't\r\nbe lookin' at 'em much to-morrow mornin'! I've got a young horse, and I\r\nwant just to show him what a foxhound's like. The meet's at Fyfold\r\nto-morrow, Andy. I wish I could mount you. I expect you ride fourteen,\r\neh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hard on it, I fancy--and I'm a fool on a horse anyhow. But I shall\r\ngo--on shanks' mare.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you now? Well, if you're as good on your legs as you used to be,\r\nit's odds you'll see a bit of the run. I recollect you in the old days,\r\nAndy; you were hard to shake off unless the goin' was uncommon good.\r\nKnew the country, you did, and where the fox was likely to make for. And\r\nI don't think you'll get the scent too good for you to-morrow. Come\r\nalong and have tea. Oh, but you're a late-dinner man, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dinner when, where, and how it comes! Tea sounds capital--with supper\r\nafter my meeting. I say, Jack, it's good to see you again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wish you'd stay here, lad. I'm much alone these days--with the old\r\ngentleman gone, and poor Nancy gone!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I shall. Anyhow I might stay here for the summer, and go up to\r\ntown to the office.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, you might do that, anyhow.\" Again Jack Rock seemed meditative, as\r\nthough he had an idea and were half-minded to disclose it. But he was a\r\nman of caution; he bided his time.\r\n\r\nAndy--nobody had ever called him Andrew since the parson who christened\r\nhim--seemed to himself to have got home again, very thoroughly home\r\nagain. Montreal with its swelling hill, its mighty river, its winter\r\nsnow, its Frenchness, its opposing self-defensive, therefore\r\nself-assertive, Britishness, was very remote. A talk with Jack Rock, a\r\nConservative meeting with a squire in the chair (that was safely to be\r\nassumed), a meet of the hounds next morning--these and a tide of\r\nintimate personal memories stamped him as at home again. The long years\r\nin the little house at the extreme end of Highcroft--Highcroft led out\r\nof High Street, tending to the west, Fyfold way--in the old grammar\r\nschool, in the peace of the sleepy town--had been a poignant memory in\r\nSouth Africa, a fading dream in the city by the great river. They sprang\r\nagain into actuality. If he felt a certain contraction in his horizon he\r\nfelt also a peace in his mind. Meriton might or might not admire\r\n\"hustlers;\" it did not hustle itself. It was a parasitic little town; it\r\nhad no manufactures, no special industry. It lived on the country\r\nsurrounding it--on the peasants, the farmers, the landowners. So it did\r\nnot grow; neither did it die. It remained much as it had been for\r\nhundreds of years, save that it was seriously considering the\r\nintroduction of electric light.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was rather of an impromptu order; Christmas holidays are\r\ngenerally held sacred from such functions. But Mr. Foot, M.P., a rising\r\nyoung member and a friend of Harry Belfield's, happened to be staying at\r\nHalton Park for shooting. Why waste him? He liked to speak, and he spoke\r\nvery well. The more Harry showed himself and got himself heard, the\r\nbetter. The young men would enjoy it. A real good dinner beforehand\r\nwould send them down in rare spirits. A bit of supper, with a\r\nwhisky-and-soda or two, and recollections of their own \"scores,\" would\r\nend the evening pleasantly. Meriton would not be excited--it was not\r\nelection time--but it would be amused, benevolent, and present in\r\nsufficiently large numbers to make the thing go with _eclat_.\r\n\r\nThere was, indeed, one topic which, from a platform at all events, one\r\ncould describe as \"burning.\" A Bill dealing with the sale of\r\nintoxicating liquor had, the session before, been introduced as the\r\nminimum a self-respecting nation could do, abused as the maximum\r\nfanatics could clamour for, carried through a second reading\r\nconsiderably amended, and squeezed out by other matters. It was to be\r\nre-introduced. The nation was recommended to consider the question in\r\nthe interval. Now the nation, though professing its entire desire to be\r\nsober--it could not well do anything else--was not sure that it desired\r\nto be made sober, was not quite clear as to the precise point at which\r\nit could or could not be held to be sober, and felt that the argument\r\nthat it would, by the gradual progress of general culture, become sober\r\nin the next generation or so--without feeling the change, so to say, and\r\nwith no violent break in the habits of this generation (certainly\r\neverybody must wish the next generation to be sober)--that this\r\nargument, which men of indisputable wisdom adduced, had great\r\nattractions. Also the nation was much afraid of the teetotallers,\r\nespecially of the subtle ones who said that true freedom lay in freedom\r\nfrom temptation. The nation thought that sort of freedom not much worth\r\nhaving, whether in the matter of drink or of any other pleasure. So\r\nthere were materials for a lively and congenial discussion, and Mr.\r\nFoot, M.P., was already in the thick of it when Andy Hayes, rather late\r\nby reason of having been lured into the stables to see the hunters after\r\ntea, reached the Town Hall and sidled his way to a place against the\r\nwall in good view of the platform and of the front benches where the\r\nbig-wigs sat. The Town Hall was quite two-thirds full--very good indeed\r\nfor the Christmas season!\r\n\r\nAndy Hayes was not much of a politician. Up to now he had been content\r\nwith the politics of his _metier_, the politics of a man trying to build\r\nup a business. But it was impossible not to enjoy Mr. Foot. He riddled\r\nthe enemy with epigram till he fell to the earth, then he jumped on to\r\nhis prostrate form and chopped it to pieces with logic. He set his\r\naudience wondering--this always happens at political meetings, whichever\r\nparty may be in power--by what odd freak of fate, by what inexplicable\r\nblunder, the twenty men chosen to rule the country should be not only\r\nthe twenty most unprincipled but also the twenty stupidest in it. Mr.\r\nFoot demonstrated the indisputable truth of this strange fact so\r\ncogently before he had been on his legs twenty minutes that gradually\r\nAndy felt absolved from listening any longer to so plain a matter; his\r\nattention began to wander to the company. It was a well-to-do\r\naudience--there were not many poor in Meriton. A few old folk might have\r\nto go to \"the house,\" but there were no distress or \"unemployment\"\r\ntroubles. The tradesfolk, their families, and employees formed the bulk.\r\nThey were presided over by Mr. Wellgood of Nutley, who might be\r\nconsidered to hold the place of second local magnate, after Mr. Belfield\r\nof Halton. He was a spare, strongly built man of two or three and forty;\r\nhis hair was clipped very close to his head; he wore a bristly moustache\r\njust touched with gray, but it too was kept so short that the lines of\r\nhis mouth, with its firm broad lips, were plain to see; his eyes were\r\nlight-blue, hard, and wary; they seemed to keep a constant watch over\r\nthe meeting, and once, when a scuffle arose among some children at the\r\nback of the hall, they gave out a fierce and formidable glance of\r\nrebuke. He had the reputation of being a strict master and a stern\r\nmagistrate; but he was a good sportsman, and Jack Rock's nearest rival\r\nafter the hounds.\r\n\r\nBeside him, waiting his turn to speak and seeming rather nervous--he was\r\nnot such an old hand at the game as Mr. Foot--sat Andy's hero, Harry\r\nBelfield. He was the pet of the town for his gay manner, good looks, and\r\ncheery accessibility to every man--and even more to every woman. His\r\nyouthful record was eminently promising, his career the subject of high\r\nhopes to his family and his fellow-citizens. Tall and slight, wearing\r\nhis clothes with an elegance free from affectation, he suggested \"class\"\r\nand \"blood\" in every inch of him. He was rather pale, with thick, soft,\r\ndark hair; his blue eyes were vivacious and full of humour, his mouth a\r\nlittle small, but delicate and sensitive, the fingers of his hands long\r\nand tapering. \"A thoroughbred\" was the only possible verdict--evidently\r\nalso a man full of sensibility, awake to the charms of life as well as\r\nto its labours; that was in keeping with all Andy's memories.\r\n\r\nThe moment he rose it was obvious with what favour he was regarded; the\r\naudience was predisposed towards all he said. He was not so epigrammatic\r\nnor so cruelly logical as Mr. Foot; he was easier, more colloquial, more\r\nconfidential; he had some chaff for his hearers as well as denunciation\r\nfor his enemies; his speech was seasoned now by a local allusion, now by\r\na sporting simile. A veteran might have found its strongest point of\r\npromise in its power of adaptation to the listeners, its gift of\r\ncreating sympathy between them and the speaker by the grace of a very\r\nattractive personality. It was a success, perhaps, more of charm than of\r\nstrength; but it may be doubted whether in the end the one does not\r\ncarry as far as the other.\r\n\r\nOn good terms as he was with them all, it soon became evident to so\r\ninterested an onlooker as Andy Hayes that he was on specially good\r\nterms, or at any rate anxious to be, in one particular quarter. After he\r\nhad made a point and was waiting for the applause to die down, not once\r\nbut three or four times he smiled directly towards the front row, and\r\ntowards that part of it where two young women sat side by side. They\r\nwere among his most enthusiastic auditors, and Andy presently found\r\nhimself, by a natural leaning towards any one who admired Harry\r\nBelfield, according to them a share of the attention which had hitherto\r\nbeen given exclusively to the hero himself.\r\n\r\nThe pair made a strong contrast. There was a difference of six or seven\r\nyears only in their ages, but while the one seemed scarcely more than a\r\nchild, it was hard to think of the other as even a girl--there was about\r\nher such an air of self-possession, of conscious strength, of a maturity\r\nof faculties. Even in applauding she seemed also to judge and assess.\r\nHer favour was discriminating; she let the more easy hits go by with a\r\nslight, rather tolerant smile, while her neighbour greeted them with\r\noutright merry laughter. She was not much beyond medium height, but of\r\nfull build, laid on ample lines; her features were rather large, and her\r\nface wore, in repose, a thoughtful tranquillity. The other, small,\r\nfrail, and delicate, with large eyes that seemed to wonder even as she\r\nlaughed, would turn to her friend with each laugh and appear to ask her\r\nsympathy--or even her permission to be pleased.\r\n\r\nAndy's scrutiny--somewhat prolonged since it yielded him all the above\r\nparticulars--was ended by his becoming aware that he in his turn was the\r\nobject of an attention not less thoroughgoing. Turning back to the\r\nplatform, he found the chairman's hard and alert eyes fixed on him in a\r\ngaze that plainly asked who he was and why he was so much interested in\r\nthe two girls. Andy blushed in confusion at being caught, but Mr.\r\nWellgood made no haste to relieve him from his rebuking glance. He held\r\nhim under it for full half a minute, turning away, indeed, only when\r\nHarry sat down among the cheers of the meeting. What business was it of\r\nWellgood's if Andy did forget his manners and stare too hard at the\r\ngirls? The next moment Andy laughed at himself for the question. In a\r\nsudden flash he remembered the younger girl. She was Wellgood's daughter\r\nVivien. He recalled her now as a little child; he remembered the\r\nwondering eyes and the timidly mirthful curl of her lips. Was it really\r\nas long ago as that since he had been in Meriton? However childlike she\r\nmight look, now she was grown-up!\r\n\r\nHis thoughts, which carried him through the few sentences with which the\r\nchairman dismissed the meeting, were scattered by the sudden grasp of\r\nHarry Belfield's hand. The moment he saw Andy he ran down from the\r\nplatform to him. His greeting was all his worshipper could ask.\r\n\r\n\"Well now, I am glad to see you back!\" he cried. \"Oh, we all heard how\r\nwell you'd done out at the front, and we thought it too bad of you not\r\nto come back and be lionized. But here you are at last, and it's all\r\nright. I must take Billy Foot home now--he's got to go to town at heaven\r\nknows what hour in the morning--but we must have a good jaw soon. Are\r\nyou at the Lion?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Andy, \"I'm staying a day or two with Jack Rock.\"\r\n\r\n\"With Jack Rock?\" Harry's voice sounded surprised. \"Oh yes, of course, I\r\nremember! He's a capital chap, old Jack! But if you're going to\r\nstay--and I hope you are, old fellow--you'll want some sort of a place\r\nof your own, won't you? Well, good-night. I'll hunt you up some time in\r\nthe next day or two, for certain. Did you like my speech?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I expected you to make a good one.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall hear me make better ones than that. Well, I really must--All\r\nright, Billy, I'm coming.\" With another clasp of the hand he rushed\r\nafter Mr. Foot, who was undisguisedly in a hurry, shouting as he went,\r\n\"Good-night, Wellgood! Good-night, Vivien! Good-night, Miss Vintry!\"\r\n\r\nMiss Vintry--that was the other girl, the one with Vivien Wellgood. Andy\r\nwas glad to know her name and docket her by it in her place among the\r\nimpressions of the evening.\r\n\r\nSo home to a splendid round of cold beef and another pint of that\r\nexcellent beer at Jack Rock's. What days life sometimes gives--or used\r\nto!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\n\r\nA VERY LITTLE HUNTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf more were needed to make a man feel at home--more than old Meriton\r\nitself, Jack Rock with his beef, and the clasp of Harry Belfield's\r\nhand--the meet of the hounds supplied it. There were hunts in other\r\nlands; Andy could not persuade himself that there were meets like this,\r\nso entirely English it seemed in the manner of it. Everybody was there,\r\nhigh and low, rich and poor, young and old. An incredible coincidence of\r\nunplausible accidents had caused an extraordinary number of people to\r\nhave occasion to pass by Fyfold Green that morning at that hour, let\r\nalone all the folk who chanced to have a \"morning off\" and proposed to\r\nsee some of the run, on horseback or on foot. The tradesmen's carts were\r\nthere in a cluster, among them two of Jack Rock's: his boys knew that a\r\nblind eye would be turned to half an hour's lateness in the delivery of\r\nthe customers' joints. For centre of the scene were the waving tails,\r\nthe glossy impatient horses, the red coats, the Master himself, Lord\r\nMeriton, in his glory and, it may be added, in the peremptory mood which\r\nis traditionally associated with his office.\r\n\r\nAndy Hayes moved about, meeting many old friends--more, indeed, than he\r\nrecognized, till a reminiscence of old days established for them again a\r\nplace in his memory. He saw Tom Dove--the Bird--mounted on a showy\r\nscrew. Wat Money--Chinks--was one of those who \"happened to be passing\"\r\non his way to a client's who lived in the opposite direction. He gave\r\nAndy a friendly greeting, and told him that if he thought of taking a\r\nhouse in Meriton, he should be careful about his lease: Foulkes,\r\nFoulkes, and Askew would look after it. Jack Rock was there, of course,\r\nkeeping himself to himself, on the outskirts of the throng: the young\r\nhorse was nervous. Harry Belfield, in perfect array, talked to Vivien\r\nWellgood, her father on a raking hunter close beside them. A great swell\r\nof home-feeling assailed Andy; suddenly he had a passionate hope that\r\nthe timber business would develop; he did not want to go back to Canada.\r\n\r\nIt was a good hunting morning, cloudy and cool, with the wind veering to\r\nthe north-east and dropping as it veered. No frost yet, but the\r\nweather-wise predicted one before long. The scent should be good--a bit\r\ntoo good, Andy reflected, for riders on shanks' mare. Their turn is best\r\nserved by a scent somewhat variable and elusive. A check here and there,\r\na fresh cast, the hounds feeling for the scent--these things, added to a\r\ncunning use of short cuts and a knowledge of the country shared by the\r\nfox, aid them to keep on terms and see something of the run--just as\r\nthey aid the heavy old gentlemen on big horses and the small boys on fat\r\nponies to get their humble share of the sport.\r\n\r\nBut in truth Andy cared little so that he could run--run hard, fast, and\r\nlong. His powerful body craved work, work, and work yet more abundantly.\r\nHis way of indulging it was to call on it for all its energies; he\r\nexulted in feeling its brave response. Fatigue he never knew--at least\r\nnot till he had changed and bathed; and then it was not real fatigue: it\r\nwas no more than satiety. Now when they had found--and they had the luck\r\nto find directly--he revelled in the heavy going of a big ploughed\r\nfield. He was at the game he loved.\r\n\r\nYes, but the pace was good--distinctly good. The spirit was willing, but\r\nhuman legs are but human, and only two in number. Craft was required.\r\nThe fox ran straight now--but had he never a thought in his mind? The\r\nfield streamed off to the right, lengthening out as it went. Andy bore\r\nto his left: he remembered Croxton's Dip. Did the fox? That was the\r\nquestion. If he did, the hunt would describe the two sides of a\r\ntriangle, while Andy cut across the base.\r\n\r\nHe was out of sight of the field now, but he could hear the hounds\r\ngiving tongue from time to time and the thud of the hoofs. The sounds\r\ngrew nearer! A thrill of triumph ran through him; his old-time knowledge\r\nhad not failed him. The fox had doubled back, making for Croxton's Dip.\r\nOver the edge of yonder hill it lay, half a mile off--a deep depression\r\nin the ground, covered with thick undergrowth. In the hope of catching\r\nup, Andy Hayes felt that he could run all day and grudge the falling of\r\nan over-hasty night.\r\n\r\n\"Blown,\" indeed, but no more than a rest of a minute would put right, he\r\nreached the ledge whence the ground sloped down sharply to the Dip. He\r\nwas in time to see the hunt race past him along the bottom--leaders, the\r\nruck, stragglers. Jack Rock and Wellgood were with the Master in the\r\nvan; he could not make out Harry Belfield; a forlorn figure looking like\r\nthe Bird laboured far in the rear.\r\n\r\nThey swept into the Dip as Andy started to race down the slope. But to\r\nhis chagrin they swept out of it again, straight up a long slope which\r\nrose on his left, the fox running game, a near kill promising, a fast\r\npoint-to-point secured. The going was too good for shanks' mare to-day.\r\nBefore he got to the bottom even the Bird had galloped by, walloping his\r\nshowy screw.\r\n\r\nTo the left, then, and up that long slope! There was nothing else for\r\nit, if he were so much as to see the kill from afar. This was exercise,\r\nif you like! His heart throbbed like the engines of a great ship; the\r\nsweat broke out on him. Oh, it was fine! That slope must be won--then\r\nHeaven should send the issue!\r\n\r\nSuddenly--even as he braced himself to face the long ascent, as the last\r\nsounds from the hunt died away over its summit--he saw a derelict, and,\r\namazed, came to a full stop.\r\n\r\nThe girl was not on her pony; she was standing beside it. The pony\r\nappeared distressed, and the girl looked no whit more cheerful. With a\r\npang to the very heart, Andy Hayes recognized a duty, and acknowledged\r\nit by a snatch at his cap.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon; anything wrong?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nHe had been interested in Vivien Wellgood the evening before, but he was\r\nmuch more than interested in the hunt. Still, she looked forlorn and\r\ndesolate.\r\n\r\n\"Would you mind looking at my pony's right front leg?\" she asked. \"I\r\nthink he's gone lame.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing about horses, but he does seem to stand rather gingerly\r\non his--er--right front leg. And he's certainly badly blown--worse than\r\nI am!\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall never catch them, shall we? It's not the least use going on,\r\nis it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know. I know the country; if you'd let me pilot you--\"\r\n\r\n\"Harry Belfield was going to pilot me, but--well, I told him not to wait\r\nfor me, and he didn't. You were at the meeting last night, weren't you?\r\nYou're Mr. Hayes, aren't you? What did you think of the speeches?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, you know, if we're to have a chance of seeing any more of\r\nthe--\" It was not the moment to discuss political speeches, however\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to see any more of it. I'll go home; I'll risk it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Risk what?\" he asked. There seemed no risk in going home; and there\r\nwas, by now, small profit in going on.\r\n\r\nShe did not answer his question. \"I think hunting's the most wretched\r\namusement I've ever tried!\" she broke out. \"The pony's lame--yes, he is;\r\nI've torn my habit\" (she exhibited a sore rent); \"I've scratched my\r\nface\" (her finger indicated the wound); \"and here I am! All I hope is\r\nthat they won't catch that poor fox. How far do you think it is to\r\nNutley?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, about three miles, I should think. You could strike the road half a\r\nmile from here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure the pony's lame. I shall go back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you like me to come with you?\"\r\n\r\nDuring their talk her eyes had wavered between indignation and\r\npiteousness--the one at the so-called sport of hunting, the other for\r\nher own woes. At Andy's question a gleam of welcome flashed into them,\r\nfollowed in an instant by a curious sort of veiling of all expression.\r\nShe made a pathetic little figure, with her habit sorely rent and a\r\nnasty red scratch across her forehead. The pony lame too--if he were\r\nlame! Andy hit on the idea that it was a question whether he were lame\r\nenough to swear by: that was what she was going to risk--in a case to be\r\ntried before some tribunal to which she was amenable.\r\n\r\n\"But don't you want to go on?\" she asked. \"You're enjoying it, aren't\r\nyou?\" The question carried no rebuke; it recognized as legitimate the\r\nwidest differences of taste.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't the least chance of catching up with them. I may as well come\r\nback with you.\"\r\n\r\nThe curious expression--or rather eclipse of expression--was still in\r\nher eyes, a purely negative defensiveness that seemed as though it could\r\nspring only from an instinctive resolve to show nothing of her feelings.\r\nThe eyes were a dark blue; but with Vivien's eyes colour never counted\r\nfor much, nor their shape, nor what one would roughly call their beauty,\r\nwere it more or less. Their meaning--that was what they set a man asking\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n\"It really would be very kind of you,\" she said.\r\n\r\nAndy mounted her on the suppositiously lame pony--her weight wouldn't\r\nhurt him much, anyhow--and they set out at a walk towards the highroad\r\nwhich led to Nutley and thence, half a mile farther on, to Meriton.\r\n\r\nShe was silent till they reached the road. Then she asked abruptly, \"Are\r\nyou ever afraid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see,\" said Andy, with a laugh, \"I never know whether I'm\r\nafraid or only excited--in fighting, I mean. Otherwise I don't fancy I'm\r\neither often.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you're big,\" she observed. \"I'm afraid of pretty nearly\r\neverything--horses, dogs, motor-cars--and I'm passionately afraid of\r\nhunting.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not big, you see,\" said Andy consolingly. Indeed her hand on the\r\nreins looked almost ridiculously small.\r\n\r\n\"I've got to learn not to be afraid of things. My father's teaching me.\r\nYou know who I am, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes; why, I remember you years ago! Is that why you're out hunting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why you think that the pony--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is lame enough to let me risk going home? Yes.\" There was a hint of\r\ndefiance in her voice. \"You must think what you like,\" she seemed to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nAndy considered the matter in his impartial, solid, rather slowly moving\r\nmind. It was foolish to be frightened at such things; it must be\r\nwholesome to be taught not to be. Still, hunting wasn't exactly a moral\r\nduty, and the girl looked very fragile. He had not arrived at any final\r\ndecision on the case--on the issue whether the girl were silly or the\r\nfather cruel (the alternatives might not be true alternatives, not\r\nstrictly exclusive of one another)--before she spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"And then I'm fastidious. Are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not!\" said Andy, with an amused chuckle. A great lump of a\r\nfellow like him fastidious!\r\n\r\n\"Father doesn't like that either, and I've got to get over it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does it--er--take you?\" Andy made bold to inquire.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, lots of ways. I hate dirt, and dust, and getting very hot, and\r\ngoing into butchers' shops, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Butchers' shops!\" exclaimed Andy, rather hit on the raw. \"You eat meat,\r\ndon't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Things don't look half as dead when they're cooked. I couldn't touch a\r\nbutcher!\" Horror rang in her tones.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but I say, Jack Rock's a butcher, and he's about the best fellow in\r\nMeriton. You know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've seen him,\" she admitted reluctantly, the subject being evidently\r\ndistasteful.\r\n\r\nFor the second time Andy Hayes was conscious of a duty: he must not\r\nbe--or seem--ashamed of Jack Rock, just because this girl was\r\nfastidious.\r\n\r\n\"I'm related to him, you know. My stepmother was his sister. And I'm\r\nstaying in his house.\"\r\n\r\nShe glanced at him, a slight flush rising to her cheeks; he saw that her\r\nlips trembled a little.\r\n\r\n\"It's no use trying to unsay things, is it?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit,\" laughed Andy. \"Don't think I'm hurt; but I should be a\r\nlow-down fellow if I didn't stand up for old Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should rather like to have you to stand up for me sometimes,\" she\r\nsaid, and broke into a smile as she added, \"You're so splendidly solid,\r\nyou see, Mr. Hayes. Here we are at home--you may as well make a complete\r\nthing of it and see me as far as the stables.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to come in--I'm not exactly a stranger here. I've often been a\r\ntrespasser. Don't tell Mr. Wellgood unless you think he'll forgive me,\r\nbut as a boy I used to come and bathe in the lake early in the\r\nmorning--before anybody was up. I used to undress in the bushes and slip\r\nin for my swim pretty nearly every morning in the summer. It's fine\r\nbathing, but you want to be able to swim; there's a strong undercurrent,\r\nwhere the stream runs through. Are you fond of bathing?\"\r\n\r\nAndy was hardly surprised when she gave a little shudder. \"No, I'm\r\nrather afraid of water.\" She added quickly, \"Don't tell my father, or I\r\nexpect I should have to try to learn to swim. He hasn't thought of that\r\nyet. No more has Isobel--Miss Vintry, my companion. You know? You saw\r\nher at the meeting. I have a companion now, instead of a governess.\r\nIsobel isn't afraid of anything, and she's here to teach me not to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mind my asking your father to let me come and swim, if I'm\r\nhere in the summer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't suppose I ought to mind that,\" she said doubtfully.\r\n\r\nThe house stood with its side turned to the drive by which they\r\napproached it from the Meriton road. Its long, low, irregular front--it\r\nwas a jumble of styles and periods--faced the lake, a stone terrace\r\nrunning between the facade and the water; it was backed by a thick wood;\r\nacross the lake the bushes grew close down to the water's edge. The\r\ndrive too ran close by the water, deep water as Andy was well aware, and\r\nwas fenced from it by a wooden paling, green from damp. The place had a\r\ncertain picturesqueness, but a sadness too. Water and trees--trees and\r\nwater--and between them the long squat house. To Andy it seemed to brood\r\nthere like a toad. But his healthy mind reverted to the fact that for a\r\nstrong swimmer the bathing was really splendid.\r\n\r\n\"Here comes Isobel! Now nothing about swimming, and say the pony's\r\nlame!\"\r\n\r\nThe injunction recalled Andy from his meditations and also served to\r\ndirect his attention to Miss Vintry, who stood, apparently waiting for\r\nthem, at the end of the drive, with the house on her right and the\r\nstables on her left. She was dressed in a business-like country frock,\r\nrather noticeably short, and carried a stick with a spike at the end of\r\nit. She looked very efficient and also very handsome.\r\n\r\nVivien told her story: Andy, not claiming expert knowledge, yet stoutly\r\nmaintained that the pony was--or anyhow had been--lame.\r\n\r\n\"He seems to be getting over it,\" said Miss Vintry, with a smile that\r\nwas not malicious but was, perhaps, rather annoyingly amused. \"I'm\r\nafraid your having had to turn back will vex your father, but I suppose\r\nthere was no help for it, and I'm sure he'll be much obliged to--\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hayes.\" Vivien supplied the name, and Andy made his bow.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I've heard Mr. Harry Belfield speak of you.\" Her tone was\r\ngracious, and she smiled at Andy good-humouredly. If she confirmed his\r\nimpression of capability, and perhaps added a new one of masterfulness,\r\nthere was at least nothing to hint that her power would not be well used\r\nor that her sway would be other than benevolent.\r\n\r\nVivien had dismounted, and a stable-boy was leading the pony away, after\r\nreceiving instructions to submit the suspected off fore-leg to his\r\nchief's inspection. There seemed nothing to keep Andy, and he was about\r\nto take his leave when Miss Vintry called to the retreating stable-boy,\r\n\"Oh, and let Curly out, will you? He hasn't had his run this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nVivien turned her head towards the stables with a quick apprehensive\r\njerk. A big black retriever, released in obedience to Isobel Vintry's\r\norder, ran out, bounding joyously. He leapt up at Isobel, pawing her and\r\nbarking in an ecstasy of delight. In passing Andy, the stranger, he gave\r\nhim another bark of greeting and a hasty pawing; then he clumsily\r\ngambolled on to where Vivien stood.\r\n\r\n\"He won't hurt you, Vivien. You know he won't hurt you, don't you?\" The\r\ndog certainly seemed to warrant Isobel's assertion; he appeared a most\r\ngood-natured animal, though his play was rough.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know he won't hurt me,\" said Vivien.\r\n\r\nThe dog leapt up at her, barking, frisking, pawing her, trying to reach\r\nher face to lick it. She made no effort to repel him; she had a little\r\nriding-whip in her hand, but she did not use it; her arms hung at her\r\nside; she was rather pale.\r\n\r\n\"There! It's not so terrible after all, is it?\" asked Isobel. \"Down,\r\nCurly, down! Come here!\"\r\n\r\nThe dog obeyed her at her second bidding, and sat down at her feet. Andy\r\nwas glad to see that the ordeal--for that was what it looked like--was\r\nover, and had been endured with tolerable fortitude; he had not enjoyed\r\nthe scene. Somewhat to his surprise Vivien's lips curved in a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Somehow I wasn't nearly so frightened to-day,\" she said. Apparently the\r\nordeal was a daily one--perhaps one of several daily ones, for she had\r\nalready been out hunting. \"I didn't run away as I did yesterday, when\r\nHarry Belfield was here.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are getting used to it,\" Isobel affirmed. \"Mr. Wellgood's quite\r\nright. We shall have you as brave as a lion in a few months.\" Her tone\r\nwas not unkind or hard, neither was it sympathetic. It was just\r\nextremely matter-of-fact. \"It's all nerves,\" she added to Andy. \"She\r\noverworked herself at school--she's very clever, aren't you,\r\nVivien?--and now she's got to lead an open-air life. She must get used\r\nto things, mustn't she?\"\r\n\r\nAndy had a shamefaced feeling that the ordeals or lessons, if they were\r\nnecessary at all, had better be conducted in privacy. That had not\r\napparently occurred to Mr. Wellgood or to Isobel Vintry. Indeed that\r\naspect of the case did not seem to trouble Vivien herself either; she\r\nshowed no signs of shame; she was smiling still, looking rather puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder why I was so much less frightened.\" She turned her eyes\r\nsuddenly to Andy. \"I know. It was because you were there!\"\r\n\r\n\"You ran away, in spite of Mr. Harry's being here yesterday,\" Isobel\r\nreminded her.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hayes is so splendidly big--so splendidly big and solid,\" said\r\nVivien, thoughtfully regarding Andy's proportions. \"When he's here, I\r\ndon't think I shall be half so much afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then Mr. Wellgood must ask him to come again,\" laughed Isobel. \"You\r\nsee how useful you'll be, Mr. Hayes!\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be delighted to come again, anyhow, if I'm asked--whether I'm\r\nuseful or not. And I think it was jolly plucky of you to stand still as\r\nyou did, Miss Wellgood. If I were in a funk, I should cut and run for\r\nit, I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you'd been a soldier,\" said Isobel.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, it's different when there are a lot of you together.\r\nBesides--\" He chuckled. \"You're not going to get me to let on that I was\r\nin a funk then. Those are our secrets, Miss Vintry. Well now, I must go,\r\nunless--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, there are no more tests of courage to-day, Mr. Hayes,\" laughed\r\nIsobel.\r\n\r\nVivien's eyes had relapsed into inexpressiveness; they told Andy nothing\r\nof her view of the trials, or of Miss Vintry, who had conducted the\r\nlatest one; they told him no more of her view of himself as she gave him\r\nher hand in farewell. He left her still standing on the spot where she\r\nhad endured Curly's violent though well-meant attentions--again rather a\r\npathetic figure, in her torn habit, with the long red scratch (by-the-by\r\nMiss Vintry had made no inquiry about it--that was part of the system\r\nperhaps) on her forehead, and with the background, as it were, of\r\nordeals, or tests, or whatever they were to be called. Andy wondered\r\nwhat they would try her with to-morrow, and found himself sorry that he\r\nwould not be there--to help her with his bigness and solidity.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to say that Mr. Wellgood's system was wrong. It was\r\nabsurd for a grown girl--a girl living in the country--to be frightened\r\nat horses, dogs, and motor-cars, to be disgusted by dirt and dust, by\r\ngetting very hot--and by butchers' shops. All these were things which\r\nshe would have to meet on her way through the world, as the world is at\r\npresent constituted. Still he was sorry for her; she was so slight and\r\nfrail. Andy would have liked to take on his broad shoulders all her\r\nworldly share of dogs and horses, of dust, of getting very hot (a thing\r\nhe positively liked), and of butchers; these things would not have\r\ntroubled him in the least; he would have borne them as easily as he\r\ncould have carried Vivien herself in his arms. As he walked home he had\r\na vision of her shuddering figure, with its pale face and reticent eyes,\r\nbeing led by Isobel Vintry's firm hand into Jack Rock's shop in High\r\nStreet, and there being compelled to inspect, to touch, to smell, the\r\nblue-rosetted, red-rosetted, and honourably mentioned carcasses which\r\nadorned that Valhalla of beasts--nay, being forced, in spite of all\r\nhorror, to touch Jack Rock the butcher himself! Isobel Vintry would, he\r\nthought, be capable of shutting her up alone with all those dead things,\r\nand with the man who, as she supposed, had butchered them.\r\n\r\n\"I should have to break in the door!\" thought Andy, his vanity flattered\r\nby remembering that she had seen in him a stand-by, and a security which\r\napparently even Harry Belfield had been unable to afford. True it was\r\nthat in order to win the rather humble compliment of being held a\r\nprotection against an absolutely harmless retriever dog he had lost his\r\nday's hunting. Andy's heart was lowly; he did not repine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\n\r\nTHE POTENT VOICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter anxious consultation at Halton it had been decided that Harry\r\nBelfield was justified in adopting a political career and treating the\r\nprofession of the Bar, to which he had been called, as nominal. The\r\nprospects of an opening--and an opening in his native Division--were\r\nrosy. His personal qualifications admitted of no dispute, his social\r\nstanding was all that could be desired. The money was the only\r\ndifficulty. Mr. Belfield's income, though still large, was not quite\r\nwhat it had been; he was barely rich enough to support his son in what\r\nis still, in spite of all that has been done in the cause of electoral\r\npurity, a costly career. However the old folk exercised economies, Harry\r\npromised them, and it was agreed that the thing could be managed. It\r\nwas, perhaps, at the back of the father's mind that for a young man of\r\nhis son's attractions there was one obvious way of increasing his\r\nincome--quite obvious and quite proper for the future owner of Halton\r\nPark.\r\n\r\nFor the moment political affairs were fairly quiet--next year it would\r\nbe different--and Harry, ostensibly engaged on a course of historical\r\nand sociological reading, spent his time pleasantly between Meriton and\r\nhis rooms in Jermyn Street. He had access to much society of one kind\r\nand another, and was universally popular; his frank delight in pleasing\r\npeople made him pleasant to them. With women especially he was a great\r\nfavourite, not for his looks only, though they were a passport to open\r\nthe door of any drawing-room, but more because they felt that he was a\r\nman who appreciated them, valued them, needed them, to whom they were a\r\nvery big and precious part of life. He had not a shred of that\r\nindifference--that independence of them--which is the worst offence in\r\nwomen's eyes. Knowing that they counted for so much to him, it was as\r\nfair as it was natural that they should let him count for a good deal\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nBut even universal favourites have their particular ties. For the last\r\nfew months Harry had been especially attached to Mrs. Freere, the wife\r\nof a member of Parliament of his own party who lived in Grosvenor\r\nStreet. Mr. Freere was an exceedingly laborious person; he sat on more\r\ncommittees than any man in London, and had little leisure for the joys\r\nof home life. Mrs. Freere could take very good care of herself, and, all\r\nquestion of principles apart, had no idea of risking the position and\r\nthe comforts she enjoyed. Subject to the limits thus clearly imposed on\r\nher, she had no objection at all to her friendship with Harry Belfield\r\nbeing as sentimental as Harry had been disposed to make it; indeed she\r\nhad a taste for that kind of thing herself. Once or twice he had tried\r\nto overstep the limits, elastic as they were--he was impulsive, Mrs.\r\nFreere was handsome--but he had accepted her rebuke with frank\r\npenitence, and the friendship had been switched back on to its appointed\r\nlines without an accident. The situation was pleasant to her; she was\r\nconvinced that it was good for Harry. Certainly he met at her house many\r\npeople whom it was proper and useful for him to meet; and her partiality\r\noffered him every opportunity of making favourable impressions. If her\r\nconscience needed any other salve--it probably did not feel the need\r\nacutely--she could truthfully aver that she was in the constant habit of\r\nurging him to lose no time in looking out for a suitable wife.\r\n\r\n\"A wife is such a help to a man in the House,\" she would say. \"She can\r\nkeep half the bores away from him. I don't do it because Wilson\r\npositively loves bores--being bored gives him a sense of serving his\r\ncountry--but I could if he'd let me.\"\r\n\r\nHarry had been accustomed to meet such prudent counsels with protests of\r\na romantic order; but Mrs. Freere, a shrewd woman, had for some weeks\r\npast noticed that the protests were becoming rather less vehement, and\r\ndecidedly more easy for her to control. When she repeated her advice one\r\nday, in the spring after Andy Hayes came back from Canada, Harry looked\r\nat her for a moment and said,\r\n\r\n\"Would you drop me altogether if I did, Lily?\" He called her Lily when\r\nthey were alone.\r\n\r\n\"I'm married; you haven't dropped me,\" said Mrs. Freere with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's different. I shouldn't marry a woman unless I was awfully in\r\nlove with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I ought to make that a reason for finally dropping you,\r\nbecause you'll probably be awfully in love with several. Put that\r\ndifficulty--if it is one--out of your mind. We shall be friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you wouldn't mind? You--you wouldn't think it--?\" He wanted to ask\r\nher whether she would think it what, on previous occasions, he had said\r\nthat he would think it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Freere laughed. \"Oh, of course your wife would be rather a\r\nbore--just at first, anyhow. But, you know, I can even contemplate my\r\nlife without you altogether, Harry.\" She was really fond of him, but she\r\nwas not a woman given to illusions either about her friends or about\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nHarry did not protest that he could not contemplate his life without\r\nMrs. Freere, though he had protested that on more than one of those\r\nprevious occasions. Mrs. Freere leant against the mantelpiece, smiling\r\ndown at him in the armchair.\r\n\r\n\"Seen somebody?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nHarry blushed hotly. \"You're an awfully good sort, Lily,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe laughed a little, then sighed a little. Well, it had been very\r\nagreeable to have this handsome boy at her beck and call, gracefully\r\nadoring, flattering her vanity, amusing her leisure, giving her the\r\nluxury of reflecting that she was behaving well in the face of\r\nconsiderable temptation--she really felt entitled to plume herself on\r\nthis exploit. But such things could not last--Mrs. Freere knew that. The\r\nbalance was too delicate; a topple over on one side or the other was\r\nbound to come; she had always meant that the toppling over, when it\r\ncame, should be on the safe side--on to the level ground, not over the\r\nprecipice. A bump is a bump, there's no denying it, but it's better than\r\na broken neck. Mrs. Freere took her bump smiling, though it certainly\r\nhurt a little.\r\n\r\n\"Is she very pretty?\"\r\n\r\nHe jumped up from the armchair. He was highly serious about the matter,\r\nand that, perhaps, may be counted a grace in him.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I shall do it--if I can. But I'm hanged if I can talk to you\r\nabout it!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's rather nice of you. Thank you, Harry.\"\r\n\r\nHe bowed his comely head, with its waving hair, over her hand and kissed\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Harry,\" she said.\r\n\r\nHe straightened himself and looked her in the face for an instant. He\r\nshrugged his shoulders; she understood and nodded. There was, in fact,\r\nno saying what one's emotions would be up to next--what would be the new\r\ncommands of the Restless and Savage Master. Poor Harry! She knew his\r\ncase. She herself had \"taken him\" from her dear friend Rosa Hinde.\r\n\r\nHe was gone. She stood still by the mantelpiece a moment longer,\r\nshrugged shoulders in her turn--really that Savage Master!--crossed the\r\nroom to a looking-glass--not much wrong there happily--and turned on the\r\nopening of the door. Mr. Freere came in--between committees. He had just\r\ntime for a cup of tea.\r\n\r\n\"Just time, Wilson?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've a committee at five, my dear.\"\r\n\r\nShe rang the bell. \"Talk of road-hogs! You're a committee-hog, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nHe rubbed his bald head perplexedly. \"They accumulate,\" he pleaded in a\r\npuzzled voice. \"I'm sorry to leave you so much alone, my dear.\" He came\r\nup to her and kissed her. \"I always want to be with you, Lily.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" she said. She did know--and the knowledge was one of the odd\r\nthings in life.\r\n\r\n\"Goodness, I forgot to telephone!\" He hurried out of the room again.\r\n\r\n\"Serves me right, I suppose!\" said Mrs. Freere; to which of recent\r\nincidents she referred must remain uncertain.\r\n\r\nMr. Freere came back for his hasty cup of tea.\r\n\r\nThe Park was gay in its spring bravery--a fine setting for the play of\r\nelegance and luxury which took place there on this as on every\r\nafternoon. Harry Belfield sought to occupy and to distract his mind by\r\nthe spectacle, familiar though it was. He did not want to congratulate\r\nhimself on the thing that had just happened, yet this was what he found\r\nhimself doing if he allowed his thoughts to possess him. \"That's over\r\nanyhow!\" was the spontaneous utterance of his feelings. Yet he felt very\r\nmean. He did not see why, having done the right thing, he should feel so\r\nmean. It seemed somehow unfair--as though there were no pleasing\r\nconscience, whatever one did. Conscience might have retorted that in\r\nsome situations there is no \"right thing;\" there is a bold but fatal\r\nthing, and there is a prudent but shabby thing; the right thing has\r\nvanished earlier in the proceedings. Still he had done the best thing\r\nopen to him, and, reflecting on that, he began to pluck up his spirits.\r\nHis sensuous nature turned to the pleasant side; his volatile emotions\r\nforsook the past for the future. As he walked along he began to hear\r\nmore plainly and to listen with less self-reproach to the voice which\r\nhad been calling him now for many days--ever since he had addressed that\r\nmeeting in the Town Hall at Meriton. Meriton was calling him back with\r\nthe voice of Vivien Wellgood, and with her eyes begging him to hearken.\r\nHe had \"seen somebody,\" in Mrs. Freere's sufficient phrase. Great and\r\ngay was London, full of lures and charms; many were they who were ready\r\nto pet, to spoil, and to idolize; many there were to play, to laugh, and\r\nto revel with. Potent must be the voice which could draw him from all\r\nthis! Yet he was listening to it as he walked along. He was free to\r\nlisten to it now--free since he had left Mrs. Freere's house in\r\nGrosvenor Street.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he found himself face to face with Andy Hayes--not a man he\r\nexpected to meet in Hyde Park at four o'clock in the afternoon. But Andy\r\nexplained that he had \"knocked off early at the shop\" and come west, to\r\nhave a last look at the idle end of the town--everybody there seemed\r\nidle, even if all were not.\r\n\r\n\"Because it's my last day in London. I'm going down to Meriton to-morrow\r\nfor the summer. I've taken lodgings there--going to be an\r\nup-and-downer,\" Andy explained. \"And I think I shall generally be able\r\nto get Friday to Monday down there.\"\r\n\r\nTo Meriton to-morrow! Harry suffered a sharp and totally unmistakable\r\npang of envy.\r\n\r\n\"Upon my soul, I believe you're right!\" he said. \"I'm half sick of the\r\nracket of town. What's the good of it all? And one gets through the\r\ndevil of a lot of money. And no time to do anything worth doing! I don't\r\nbelieve I've opened a book for a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, why don't you come down too? It would be awfully jolly if you\r\ndid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's not altogether easy to chuck everything and everybody,\" Harry\r\nreminded his friend, who did not seem to have reflected what a gap would\r\nbe caused by Mr. Harry Belfield's departure from the metropolis. \"Still\r\nI shall think about it. I could get through a lot of work at home.\" The\r\nhistorical and sociological reading obligingly supplied an excellent\r\nmotive for a flight from the too-engrossing gaieties of town. \"And, of\r\ncourse, there's no harm in keeping an eye on the Division.\" The potent\r\nvoice was gathering allies apace! Winning causes have that way. \"I might\r\ndo much worse,\" Harry concluded thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nAndy was delighted. Harry's presence would make Meriton a different\r\nplace to him. He too, for what he was worth (it is not possible to say\r\nthat he was worth very much in this matter), became another ally of the\r\npotent voice, urging the joys of country life and declaring that Harry\r\nalready looked \"fagged out\" by the arduous pleasures of London life.\r\n\r\n\"I shall think about it seriously,\" said Harry, knowing in himself that\r\nthe voice had won. \"Are you doing anything to-night? I happen for once\r\nto have an off evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; only I'd thought of dropping into the pit somewhere. I haven't seen\r\n'Hamlet' at the--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh lord!\" interrupted Harry. \"Let's do something a bit more cheerful\r\nthan that! Have you seen the girl at the Empire--the Nun? Not seen her?\r\nOh, you must! We'll dine at the club and go; and I'll get her and\r\nanother girl to come on to supper. I'll give you a little fling for your\r\nlast night in town. Will you come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will I come? I should rather think I would!\" cried Andy.\r\n\r\n\"All right; dinner at eight. We shall have lots of time--she doesn't\r\ncome on till nearly ten. Meet me at the Artemis at eight. Till then, old\r\nchap!\" Harry darted after a lady who had favoured him with a gracious\r\nbow as she passed by, a moment before.\r\n\r\nHere was an evening-out for Andy Hayes, whose conscience had suggested\r\n\"Hamlet\" and whose finances had dictated the pit. He went home to his\r\nlodgings off Russell Square all smiles, and spent a laborious hour\r\ntrying to get the creases out of his dress coat. \"Well, I shall enjoy an\r\nevening like that just for once,\" he said out loud as he laboured.\r\n\r\n\"I've got her and another girl,\" Harry announced when Andy turned up at\r\nthe Artemis. \"The nuisance is that Billy Foot here insists on coming\r\ntoo, so we shall be a man over. I've told him I don't want him, but the\r\nfellow will come.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm certainly coming,\" said the tall long-faced young man--for Billy\r\nFoot was still several years short of forty--to whom Andy had listened\r\nwith such admiration at Meriton. In private life he was not oppressively\r\nepigrammatic or logical, and not at all ruthless; and everybody called\r\nhim \"Billy,\" which in itself did much to deprive him of his terrors.\r\n\r\nThe Artemis was a small and luxurious club in King Street. Why it was\r\ncalled the \"Artemis\" nobody knew. Billy Foot said that the name had been\r\nchosen just because nobody would know why it had been chosen--it was a\r\nbad thing, he maintained, to label a club. Harry, however, conjectured\r\nthat the name indicated that the club was half-way between the Athenaeum\r\nand the Turf--which you might take in the geographical sense or in any\r\nother you pleased.\r\n\r\nAndy ate of several foods that he had never tasted before and drank\r\nbetter wine than he had ever drunk before. His physique and his steady\r\nbrain made any moderate quantity of wine no more than water to him.\r\nHarry Belfield, on the contrary, responded felicitously to even his\r\nfirst glass of champagne; his eyes grew bright and his spirit gay. Any\r\nshadow cast over him by his interview with Mrs. Freere was not long in\r\nvanishing.\r\n\r\nThey enjoyed themselves so well that a cab had only just time to land\r\nthem at their place of entertainment before the Nun, whose name was Miss\r\nDoris Flower, came on the stage. She was having a prodigious success\r\nbecause she did look like a nun and sang songs that a nun might really\r\nbe supposed to sing--and these things, being quite different from what\r\nthe public expected, delighted the public immensely. When Miss Flower,\r\nwhose performance was of high artistic merit, sang about the baby which\r\nshe might have had if she had not been a nun, and in the second song\r\n(she was on her death-bed in the second song, but this did not at all\r\nimpair her vocal powers) about the angel whom she saw hovering over her\r\nbed, and the angel's likeness to her baby sister who had died in\r\ninfancy, the public cried like a baby itself.\r\n\r\n\"Jolly good!\" said Billy Foot, taking his cigar out of his mouth and\r\nwiping away a furtive tear. \"But there, she is a ripper, bless her!\" His\r\ntone was distinctly affectionate.\r\n\r\nBut supper was the great event to Andy: that was all new to him, and he\r\ntook it in eagerly while they waited for the Nun and her friend. Such a\r\ndin, such a chatter, such a lot of diamonds, such a lot of smoke--and\r\nthe white walls, the gilding, the pink lampshades, the band ever and\r\nanon crashing into a new tune, and the people shouting to make\r\nthemselves heard through it--Andy would have sat on happily watching,\r\neven though he had got no supper at all. Indeed he was no more hungry\r\nthan most of the other people there. One does not go to supper there\r\nbecause one is hungry--that is a vulgar reason for eating.\r\n\r\nHowever supper he had, sitting between Billy Foot and the Nun's friend,\r\na young woman named Miss Dutton, who had a critical, or even sardonic,\r\nmanner, but was extremely pretty. The Nun herself contrived to be rather\r\nlike a nun even off the stage; she did not talk much herself, but\r\nlistened with an innocent smile to the sallies of Billy Foot and Harry\r\nBelfield.\r\n\r\n\"Been to hear her?\" Miss Dutton asked Andy.\r\n\r\nAndy said that they had, and uttered words of admiration.\r\n\r\n\"Sort of thing they like, isn't it?\" said Miss Dutton. \"You can't put in\r\ntoo much rot for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she sings it so--\" Andy began to plead.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she can sing. It's a wonder she's succeeded. How sick one gets of\r\nthis place!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you come often?\"\r\n\r\n\"Every night--with her generally.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've never been here before in my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I hope you like the look of us!\"\r\n\r\nHarry Belfield looked towards him. \"Don't mind what she says, Andy. We\r\ncall her Sulky Sally--don't we, Sally?--But she looks so nice that we\r\nhave to put up with her ways.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Dutton smiled reluctantly, but evidently could not help smiling at\r\nHarry. \"I know the value of your compliments,\" she remarked. \"There are\r\nplenty of them going about the place to judge by!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy, Sally, mercy! Don't show me up before my friends!\"\r\n\r\nMiss Dutton busied herself with her supper. The Nun ate little; most of\r\nthe time she sat with her pretty hands clasped on the table in front of\r\nher. Suddenly she began to tell what proved to be a rather long story\r\nabout a man named Tommy--everybody except Andy knew whom she meant. She\r\ntold this story in a low, pleasant, but somewhat monotonous voice. In\r\ntruth the Nun was a trifle prolix and prosy, but she also looked so nice\r\nthat they were quite content to listen and to look. It appeared that\r\nTommy had done what no man should do; he had made love to two girls at\r\nonce. For a long time all went well; but one day Tommy, being away from\r\nthe sources of supply of cash (as a rule he transacted all his business\r\nin notes), wrote two cheques--the Nun specified the amounts, one being\r\nconsiderably larger than the other--placed them in two envelopes, and\r\nproceeded to address them wrongly. Each lady got the other lady's\r\ncheque, and--\"Well, they wanted to know about it,\" said the Nun, with a\r\npensive smile. So, being acquaintances, they laid their heads together,\r\nand the next time Tommy (who had never discovered his mistake) asked\r\nlady number one to dinner, she asked lady number two, \"and when Tommy\r\narrived,\" said the Nun, \"they told him he'd find it cheaper that way,\r\nbecause there'd only be one tip for the waiter!\" The Nun, having reached\r\nher point, gave a curiously pretty little gurgle of laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Rather neat!\" said Billy Foot. \"And did they chuck him?\"\r\n\r\n\"They'd agreed to, but Maud weakened on it. Nellie did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor old Tommy!\" mused Harry Belfield.\r\n\r\nIt was not a story of surpassing merit whether it were regarded from the\r\nmoral or from the artistic point of view; but the Nun had grown\r\ndelighted with herself as she told it, and her delight made her look\r\neven more pretty. Andy could not keep his eyes off her; she perceived\r\nhis honest admiration and smiled serenely at him across the table.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it was Nellie who was to have the small cheque?\" Billy Foot\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n\"No; it was Maud.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I drink to Maud as a true woman and a forgiving creature!\"\r\n\r\nAndy broke into a hearty enjoying laugh. Nothing had passed which would\r\nstand a critical examination in humour, much less in wit; but Andy was\r\nvery happy. He had never had such a good time, never seen so many gay\r\nand pretty women, never been so in touch with the holiday side of life.\r\nThe Nun delighted him; Miss Dutton was a pleasantly acid pickle to\r\nstimulate the palate for all this rich food. Billy Foot and Harry looked\r\nat him, looked at one another, and laughed.\r\n\r\n\"They're laughing at you,\" said Miss Dutton in her most sardonic tone.\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind. Of course they are! I'm such an outsider.\"\r\n\r\n\"Worth a dozen of either of them,\" she remarked, with a calmly\r\nimpersonal air that reduced her compliment to a mere statement of fact.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I heard!\" cried Harry. \"You don't think much of us, do you, Sally?\"\r\n\r\n\"I come here every night,\" said Miss Dutton. \"Consequently I know.\"\r\n\r\nThe pronouncement was so confident, so conclusive, that there was\r\nnothing to do but laugh at it. They all laughed. If you came there every\r\nnight, \"consequently\" you would know many things!\r\n\r\n\"We must eat somewhere,\" observed the Nun with placid resignation.\r\n\r\n\"We must be as good as we can and hope for mercy,\" said Billy Foot.\r\n\r\n\"You'll need it,\" commented Miss Dutton.\r\n\r\n\"Let's hope the law of supply and demand will hold good!\" laughed Harry.\r\n\r\n\"How awfully jolly all this is!\" said Andy.\r\n\r\nHe had just time to observe Miss Dutton's witheringly patient smile\r\nbefore the lights went out. \"Hullo!\" cried Andy; and the rest laughed.\r\n\r\nUp again the lights went, but the Nun rose from her chair.\r\n\r\n\"Had enough of it?\" asked Harry.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Nun with her simple, candid, yet almost scornful\r\ndirectness. \"Oh, it's been all right. I like your friend, Harry--not\r\nBilly, of course--the new one, I mean.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they had got their cloaks and coats and were waiting for the Nun's\r\nelectric brougham, Harry made an announcement that filled Andy with joy\r\nand the rest of the company with amazement.\r\n\r\n\"This is good-bye for a bit, Doris,\" he said. \"I'm off to the country\r\nthe day after to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have we done to you?\" the Nun inquired with sedate anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"I've got to work, and I can't do it in London. I've got a career to\r\nlook after.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun gurgled again--for the second time only in the course of the\r\nevening. \"Oh yes,\" she murmured with obvious scepticism. \"Well, come and\r\nsee me when you get back.\" She turned her eyes to Andy, and, to his\r\ngreat astonishment, asked, \"Would you like to come too?\"\r\n\r\nAndy could hardly believe that he was himself, but he had no doubt about\r\nhis answer. The Nun interested him very much, and was so very pretty. \"I\r\nshould like to awfully,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Come alone--not with these men, or we shall only talk nonsense,\" said\r\nthe Nun, as she got into her brougham. \"Get in, Sally.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where's the hurry?\" asked Miss Dutton, getting in nevertheless. The Nun\r\nslapped her arm smartly; the two girls burst into a giggle, and so went\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\"Where to now?\" asked Harry.\r\n\r\nAndy wondered what other place there was.\r\n\r\n\"Bed for me,\" said Billy Foot. \"I've a consultation at half-past nine,\r\nand I haven't opened the papers yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bed is best,\" Harry agreed, though rather reluctantly. \"Going to take a\r\ncab, Billy?\"\r\n\r\n\"What else is there to take?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thought you might be walking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, walking be ----!\" He climbed into a hansom.\r\n\r\n\"I'll walk with you, Harry. I haven't had exercise enough.\"\r\n\r\nHarry suggested that they should go home by the Embankment. When they\r\nhad cut down a narrow street to it, he put his arm in Andy's and led him\r\nacross the road. They leant on the parapet, looking at the river. The\r\nnight was fine, but hazy and still--a typical London night.\r\n\r\n\"You've given me a splendid evening,\" said Andy. \"And what a good sort\r\nthose girls were!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Harry, rather absently, \"not a bad sort. Doris has got her\r\nhead on her shoulders, and she's quite straight. Poor Sally's come one\r\nawful cropper. She won't come another; she's had more than enough of it.\r\nSo one doesn't mind her being a bit snarly.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Sally! Andy had had no idea of anything of the sort, but he had an\r\ninstinct that people who come one cropper--and one only--feel that one\r\nbadly.\r\n\r\n\"I'm feeling happy to-night, old fellow,\" said Harry suddenly. \"You may\r\nnot happen to know it, but I've gone it a bit for the last two or three\r\nyears, made rather a fool of myself, and--well, one gets led on. Now\r\nI've made up my mind to chuck all that. Some of it's all right--at any\r\nrate it seems to happen; but I've had enough. I really do want to work\r\nat the politics, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all before you, if you do,\" said Andy in unquestioning loyalty.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to work, and to pull up a bit all round, and--\" Harry broke\r\noff, but a smile was on his lips. There on the bank of the Thames, fresh\r\nfrom his party in the gay restaurant, he heard the potent voice calling.\r\nIt seemed to him that the voice was potent enough not only to loose him\r\nfrom Mrs. Freere, to lure him from London delights, to carry him down to\r\nMeriton and peaceful country life; but potent enough, too, to transform\r\nhim, to make him other than he was, to change the nature that had till\r\nnow been his very self. He appealed from passion to passion; from the\r\nsoiled to the clean, from the turgid to the clear. A new desire of his\r\neyes was to make a new thing of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\n\r\nSETTLED PROGRAMMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMark Wellgood of Nutley had a bugbear, an evil thing to which he gave\r\nthe name of sentimentality. Wherever he saw it he hated it--and he saw\r\nit everywhere. No matter what was the sphere of life, there was the\r\nenemy ready to raise its head, and Mark Wellgood ready to hit that head.\r\nIn business and in public affairs he warred against it unceasingly; in\r\nother people's religion--he had very little of his own--he was keen to\r\ndenounce it; even from the most intimate family and personal\r\nrelationships he had always been resolved to banish it, or, failing\r\nthat, to suppress its manifestations. Himself a man of uncompromising\r\ntemper and strong passions, he saw in this hated thing the root of all\r\nthe vices with which he had least sympathy. It made people cowards who\r\nshrank from manfully taking their own parts; it made them hypocrites who\r\nwould not face the facts of human nature and human society, but sought\r\nto cover up truths that they would have called \"ugly\" by specious names,\r\nby veils, screens, and fine paraphrases. It made men soft, women\r\nchildish, and politicians flabby; it meant sheer ruin to a nation.\r\n\r\nSentimentality was, of course, at the bottom of what was the matter with\r\nhis daughter, of those things of which, with the aid of Isobel Vintry's\r\nexample, he hoped to cure her--her timidity and her fastidiousness. But\r\nit was at the bottom of much more serious things than these--since to\r\nmake too much fuss about a girl's nonsensical fancies would be\r\nsentimental in himself. Notably it was at the bottom of all shades of\r\nopinion from Liberalism to Socialism, both included. Harry Belfield,\r\nlunching at Nutley a week or so after his return to Meriton, had the\r\nbenefit of these views, with which, as a prospective Conservative\r\ncandidate, he was confidently expected to sympathise.\r\n\r\n\"I've only one answer to make to a Socialist,\" said Wellgood. \"I say to\r\nhim, 'You can have my property when you're strong enough to take it.\r\nUntil then, you can't.' Under democracy we count heads instead of\r\nbreaking them. It's a bad system, but it's tolerable as long as the\r\nmatter isn't worth fighting about. When you come to vital issues, it'll\r\nbreak down--it always has. We, the governing classes, shall keep our\r\nposition and our property just as long as we're able and willing to\r\ndefend them. If the Socialists mean business, they'd better stop talking\r\nand learn to shoot.\"\r\n\r\n\"That might be awkward for us,\" said Harry, with a smile at Vivien\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\n\"But if they think we're going to sit still and be voted out of\r\neverything, they're much mistaken. That's what I hope, at all events,\r\nthough it needs a big effort not to despair of the country sometimes.\r\nPeople won't look at the facts of nature. All nature's a fight from\r\nbeginning to end. All through, the strong hold down the weak; and the\r\nstrong grow stronger by doing it--never mind whether they're men or\r\nbeasts.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a lot of truth in that; but I don't know that it would be very\r\npopular on a platform--even on one of ours!\"\r\n\r\n\"You political fellows have to wrap it up, I suppose, but the cleverer\r\nheads among the working men know all about it--trust them! They're on\r\nthe make themselves; they want to get where we are; gammoning the common\r\nrun helps towards that. Oh, they're not sentimental! I do them the\r\njustice to believe that.\"\r\n\r\n\"But isn't there a terrible lot of misery, father?\" asked Vivien.\r\n\r\n\"You can't cure misery by quackery, my dear,\" he answered concisely.\r\n\"Half of it's their own fault, and for the rest--hasn't there always\r\nbeen? So long as some people are weaker than others, they'll fare worse.\r\nI don't see any particular attraction in the idea of making weaklings or\r\ncowards as comfortable as the strong and the brave.\" His glance at his\r\ndaughter was stern. Vivien flushed a little; the particular ordeal of\r\nthat morning, a cross-country ride with her father, had not been a\r\nbrilliant success.\r\n\r\n\"To him that hath shall be given, eh?\" Harry suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Matter of Scripture, Harry, and you can't get away from it!\" said\r\nWellgood with a laugh.\r\n\r\nPsychology is not the strong point of a mind like Wellgood's. To study\r\nhis fellow-creatures curiously seems to such a man rather unnecessary\r\nand rather twaddling work; in its own sphere it corresponds to the hated\r\nthing itself, to an over-scrupulous worrying about other people's\r\nfeelings or even about your own. It had not occurred to Wellgood to\r\nstudy Harry Belfield. He liked him, as everybody did, and he had no idea\r\nhow vastly Harry's temperament differed from his own. Harry had many\r\nmaterial guarantees against folly--his birth, the property that was to\r\nbe his, the career opening before him. If Wellgood saw any signs of what\r\nhe condemned, he set them down to youth and took up the task of a mentor\r\nwith alacrity. Moreover he was glad to have Harry coming to the house;\r\nmatters were still at an early stage, but if there were a purpose in his\r\ncoming, there was nothing to be said against the project. He would\r\nwelcome an alliance with Halton, and it would be an alliance on even\r\nterms; for Vivien had some money of her own, apart from what he could\r\nleave her. Whether she would have Nutley or not--well, that was\r\nuncertain. Wellgood was only forty-three and young for his years; he\r\nmight yet marry and have a son. A second marriage was more than an idea\r\nin his head; it was an intention fully formed. The woman he meant to ask\r\nto be his wife at the suitable moment lived in his house and sat at his\r\ntable with him--his daughter's companion, Isobel Vintry.\r\n\r\nIsobel had sat silent through Wellgood's talk, not keenly interested in\r\nthe directly political aspect of it, but appreciating the view of human\r\nnature and of the way of the world which underlay it. She also was on\r\nthe side of the efficient--of the people who knew what they wanted and\r\nat any rate made a good fight to get it. Yet while she listened to\r\nWellgood, her eyes had often been on Harry; she too was beginning to ask\r\nwhy Harry came so much to Nutley; the obvious answer filled her with a\r\nvague stirring of discontent. An ambitious self-confident nature does\r\nnot like to be \"counted out,\" to be reckoned out of the running before\r\nthe race is fairly begun. Why was the answer obvious? There was more\r\nthan one marriageable young woman at Nutley. Her feeling of protest was\r\nstill vague; but it was there, and when she looked at Harry's comely\r\nface, her eyes were thoughtful.\r\n\r\nThough Wellgood had business after lunch, Harry stayed on awhile,\r\nsitting out on the terrace by the lake, for the day was warm and fine.\r\nThe coming of spring had mitigated the grimness of Nutley; the water\r\nthat had looked dreary and dismal in the winter now sparkled in the sun.\r\nHarry was excellently well content with himself and his position. He\r\ntold the two girls that things were shaping very well. Old Sir George\r\nMillington had decided to retire. He was to be the candidate; he would\r\nstart his campaign through the villages of the Division in the late\r\nsummer, when harvest was over; he could hardly be beaten; and he was\r\n\"working like a horse\" at his subjects.\r\n\r\n\"The horse gets out of harness now and then!\" said Isobel.\r\n\r\n\"You don't want him to kill himself with work, Isobel?\" asked Vivien\r\nreproachfully.\r\n\r\n\"Visits to Nutley help the work; they inspire me,\" Harry declared,\r\nlooking first at Vivien, then at Isobel. They were both, in their\r\ndifferent ways, pleasant to look at. Their interest in him--in all he\r\nsaid and did, and in all he was going to do--was very pleasant also.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I'm working all right!\" he laughed. \"Really I have to, because\r\nof old Andy Hayes. He's getting quite keen on politics--reads all the\r\nevening after he gets back from town. Well, he's good enough to think\r\nI've read everything and know everything, and whenever we meet he pounds\r\nme with questions. I don't want Andy to catch me out, so I have to mug\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's your friend, Vivien,\" said Isobel, with a smile and a nod.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the solid man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know that story. Andy told me himself. He thought you behaved\r\nlike a brick.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did, anyhow. Why don't you bring him here, Harry?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's in town all day; I'll try and get him here some Saturday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he still stay with the--with Mr. Rock?\" asked Vivien.\r\n\r\n\"No; he's taken lodgings. He's very thick with old Jack still, though.\r\nOf course it wouldn't do to tell him so, but it's rather a bore that he\r\nshould be connected with Jack in that way. It doesn't make my mother any\r\nkeener to have him at Halton, and it's a little difficult for me to\r\npress it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does make his position seem--just rather betwixt and between,\r\ndoesn't it?\" asked Isobel.\r\n\r\n\"If only it wasn't a butcher!\" protested Vivien.\r\n\r\n\"O Vivien, the rules, the rules!\" \"Nothing against butchers,\" was one of\r\nthe rules.\r\n\r\n\"I know, but I would so much rather it had been a draper, or a\r\nstationer, or something--something clean of that sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad your father's not here. Be good, Vivien!\"\r\n\r\n\"However it's not so bad if he doesn't stay there any more,\" Harry\r\ncharitably concluded. \"Just going in for a drink with old\r\nJack--everybody does that; and after all he's no blood relation.\" He\r\nlaughed. \"Though I dare say that's exactly what you'd call him, Vivien.\"\r\n\r\nJust as he made his little joke Vivien had risen. It was her time for\r\n\"doing the flowers,\" one of the few congenial tasks allowed her. She\r\nsmiled and blushed at Harry's hit at her, looking very charming. Harry\r\nindulged himself in a glance of bold admiration. It made her cheeks\r\nredder still as she turned away, Harry looking after her till she\r\nrounded the corner of the house. In answering the call of the voice he\r\nhad found no disappointment. Closer and more intimate acquaintance\r\nrevealed her as no less charming than she had promised to be. Harry was\r\nsure now of what he wanted, and remained quite sure of all the wonderful\r\nthings that it was going to do for him and for his life.\r\n\r\nSuddenly on the top of all this legitimate and proper feeling--to which\r\nnot even Mark Wellgood himself could object, since it was straight in\r\nthe way of nature--there came on Harry Belfield a sensation rare, yet\r\nnot unknown, in his career--a career still so short, yet already so\r\nemotionally eventful.\r\n\r\nIsobel Vintry was not looking at him--she was gazing over the lake--nor\r\nhe at her; he was engaged in the process of lighting a cigarette. Yet he\r\nbecame intensely aware of her, not merely as one in his company, but as\r\na being who influenced him, affected him, in some sense stretched out a\r\nhand to him. He gave a quick glance at her; she was motionless, her eyes\r\nstill aloof from him. He stirred restlessly in his chair; the air seemed\r\nvery close and heavy. He wanted to make some ordinary, some light\r\nremark; for the moment it did not come. A remembrance of the first time\r\nthat Mrs. Freere and he had passed the bounds of ordinary friendship\r\nstruck across his mind, unpleasantly, and surely without relevance!\r\nIsobel had said nothing, had done nothing, nor had he. Yet it was as\r\nthough some mystic sign had passed from her to him--he could not tell\r\nwhether from him to her also--a sign telling that, whatever\r\ncircumstances might do, there was in essence a link between them, a\r\nreminder from her that she too was a woman, that she too had her power.\r\nHe did not doubt that she was utterly unconscious, but neither did he\r\nbelieve that he was solely responsible, that he had merely imagined.\r\nThere was an atmosphere suddenly formed--an atmosphere still and heavy\r\nas the afternoon air that brooded over the unruffled lake.\r\n\r\nHarry had no desire to abide in it. His mind was made up; his heart was\r\nsingle. He picked up a stone which had been swept from somewhere on to\r\nthe terrace and pitched it into the lake. A plop, and many ripples. The\r\nheavy stillness was broken.\r\n\r\nIsobel turned to him with a start.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were going to sleep, Miss Vintry. I couldn't think of\r\nanything to say, so I threw a stone into the water. I'm afraid you were\r\nfinding me awfully dull!\"\r\n\r\n\"You dull! You're a change from what sometimes does seem a little\r\ndull--life at Nutley. But perhaps you can't conceive life at Nutley\r\nbeing dull?\" Her eyes mocked him with the hint that she had discovered\r\nhis secret.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I think I should be rather hard to please if I found Nutley\r\ndull,\" he said gaily. \"But if you do, why do you stay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perpetual amusement isn't in a companion's contract, Mr. Harry.\r\nBesides, I'm fond of Vivien. I should be sorry to leave her before the\r\nnatural end of my stay comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The natural end?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I think you understand that.\" She smiled with a good-humoured scorn\r\nat his homage to pretence.\r\n\r\n\"Well, of course, girls do marry. It's been known to happen,\" said\r\nHarry, neither \"cornered\" nor embarrassed. \"But perhaps\"--he glanced at\r\nher, wondering whether to risk a snub. His charm, his gift of gay\r\nimpudence, had so often stood him in stead and won him a liberty that a\r\nheavy-handed man could not hope to be allowed; he was not much\r\nafraid--\"Perhaps you'd be asked to stay on--in another capacity, Miss\r\nVintry.\"\r\n\r\n\"It looks as if your thoughts were running on such things.\" She did not\r\naffect not to understand, but she was not easy to corner either.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid they always have been,\" Harry confessed, a confession\r\nwithout much trace of penitence.\r\n\r\n\"Mine don't often; and they're never supposed to--in my position.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nonsense! Really that doesn't go down, Miss Vintry. Why, a girl\r\nlike you, with such--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't attempt a catalogue, please, Mr. Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right, quite right. I'm conscious how limited my powers are.\"\r\n\r\nHarry Belfield could no more help this sort of thing than a bird can\r\nhelp flying. In childhood he had probably lisped in compliments, as the\r\npoet in numbers. In itself it was harmless, even graceful, and quite\r\ndevoid of serious meaning. Yet it was something new in his relations\r\nwith Isobel Vintry; though it had arisen out of a desire to dispel that\r\nmysterious atmosphere, yet it was a sequel to it. Hitherto she had been\r\nVivien's companion. In that brief session of theirs--alone together by\r\nthe lake--she had assumed an independent existence for him, a vivid,\r\ndistinctive, rather compelling one. The impressionable mind received a\r\nnew impression, the plastic feelings suffered the moulding of a fresh\r\nhand. Harry, who was alert to watch himself and always knew when he was\r\ninterested, was telling himself that she was such a notable foil to\r\nVivien; that was why he was interested. Vivien was still the centre of\r\ngravity. The explanation vindicated his interest, preserved his loyalty,\r\nand left his resolve unshaken. These satisfactory effects were all on\r\nhimself; the idea of effects on Isobel Vintry did not occur to him. He\r\nwas not vain, he was hardly a conscious or intentional \"lady-killer.\" He\r\nreally suffered love affairs rather than sought them; he was driven into\r\nthem by an overpowering instinct to prove his powers. He could not help\r\n\"playing the game\"--the rather hazardous game--to the full extent of his\r\nnatural ability. That extent was very considerable.\r\n\r\nHe said good-bye to her, laughingly declaring that after all he would\r\nprepare a catalogue, and send it to her by post. Then he went into the\r\nhouse, to find Vivien and pay another farewell. Left alone, Isobel rose\r\nfrom her chair with an abrupt and impatient movement. She was a woman of\r\nfeelings not only more mature but far stronger than Vivien's; she had\r\nambitious yearnings which never crossed Vivien's simple soul. But she\r\nwas stern with herself. Perhaps she had caught and unconsciously copied\r\nsome of Wellgood's anti-sentimental attitude. She often told herself\r\nthat the feelings were merely dangerous and the yearnings silly. Yet\r\nwhen others seemed tacitly to accept that view, made no account of her,\r\nand assumed to regard her place in life as settled, she glowed with a\r\ndeep resentment against them, crying that she would make herself felt.\r\nTo-day she knew that somehow, to some degree however small, she had made\r\nherself felt by Harry Belfield. The discovery could not be said to bring\r\npleasure, but it brought triumph--triumph and an oppressive\r\nrestlessness.\r\n\r\nWellgood strolled out of the house and joined her. \"Where's Harry?\" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"He went into the house to say good-bye to Vivien; or perhaps he's gone\r\naltogether by now.\"\r\n\r\nWellgood stood in thought, his hands in his pockets.\r\n\r\n\"He's a bit inclined to be soft, but I think we shall make a man of him.\r\nHe's got a great chance, anyhow. Vivien seems to like him, doesn't she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, everybody must!\" She smiled at him. \"Are you thinking of\r\nmatch-making, like a good father?\"\r\n\r\n\"She might do worse, and I'd like her to marry a man we know all about.\r\nThe poor child hasn't backbone to stand up for herself if she happened\r\non a rascal.\"\r\n\r\nIsobel had a notion that Wellgood was over-confident if he assumed that\r\nhe, or they, knew all about Harry Belfield. His parentage, his position,\r\nhis prospects--yes. Did these exhaust the subject? But Wellgood's\r\ndownright mind would have seen only \"fancies\" in such a suggestion.\r\n\r\n\"If that's the programme, I must begin to think of packing up my\r\ntrunks,\" she said with a laugh.\r\n\r\nHe did not join in her laugh, but his stern lips relaxed into a smile.\r\n\"Lots of time to think about that,\" he told her, his eyes seeming to\r\nmake a careful inspection of her. \"Nutley would hardly be itself without\r\nyou, Isobel.\"\r\n\r\nShe showed no sign of embarrassment under his scrutiny; she stood\r\nhandsome and apparently serene in her composure.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, poor Nutley would soon recover from the blow,\" she said. \"But I\r\nshall be sorry to go. You've been very kind to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've done your work very well. People who work well are well treated\r\nat Nutley; people who work badly--\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't exactly petted? No, they're not, Mr. Wellgood, I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd always do your work, whatever it might be, well, so you'd always\r\nbe well treated.\"\r\n\r\n\"At any rate you'll give me a good character?\" she asked mockingly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'll see that you get a good place,\" he answered her in the same\r\ntone, but with a hint of serious meaning in his eyes.\r\n\r\nHis plan was quite definite, his confidence in the issue of it absolute.\r\nBut \"one thing at a time\" was among his maxims. He would like to see\r\nVivien's affair settled before his own was undertaken. His idea was that\r\nhis declaration and acceptance should follow on his daughter's\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\nIsobel was not afraid of Mark Wellgood, as his daughter was, and as so\r\nmany women would have been. She had a self-confidence equal to his own;\r\nshe added to it a subtlety which would secure her a larger share of\r\nindependence than it would be politic to claim openly. She had not\r\nfeared him as a master, and would not fear him as a husband. Moreover\r\nshe understood him far better than he read her. Understanding gives\r\npower. And she liked him; there was much that was congenial to her in\r\nhis mind and modes of thought. He was a man, a strong man. But the\r\nprospect at which his words hinted--she was not blind to their meaning,\r\nand for some time back had felt little doubt of his design--did not\r\nenrapture her. At first sight it seemed that it ought. She had no money,\r\nher family were poor, marriage was her only chance of independence.\r\nNutley meant both a comfort and a status beyond her reasonable hopes.\r\nBut it meant also an end to the ambitious dreams. It was finality. Just\r\nthis life she led now for all her life--or at least all Wellgood's! He\r\nwas engrossed in the occupations of a country gentleman of moderate\r\nmeans, in his estate work and his public work. He hardly ever went to\r\nLondon; he never travelled farther afield; he visited little even among\r\nhis neighbours. Some of these habits a wife might modify; the essentials\r\nof the life she would hardly be able to change. Yet, if she got the\r\nchance, there was no question but that she ought to take it. Common\r\nsense told her that, just as it told Wellgood that it would be absurd to\r\ndoubt of her acceptance.\r\n\r\nCommon sense might say what it liked. Her feelings were in revolt, and\r\ntheir insurrection gathered fresh strength to-day. It was not so much\r\nthat Wellgood was nearly twenty years her senior. That counted, but not\r\nas heavily as perhaps might be expected, since his youthful vigour was\r\nstill all his. It was the certainty with which his thoughts disposed of\r\nher, his assumption that his suit would be free from difficulty and from\r\nrivalry, his matter-of-course conclusion that Harry could come to Nutley\r\nonly for Vivien's sake. If these things wounded her woman's pride, the\r\nsofter side of her nature lamented the absence of romance, of the thrill\r\nof love, of being wooed and won in some poetic fashion, of\r\neverything--she found her thoughts insensibly taking this\r\ndirection--that it would be for Harry Belfield's chosen mistress to\r\nenjoy. Nobody--least of all the man who was content to take her to wife\r\nhimself--seemed to think of her as a choice even possible to Harry. He\r\nwas, of course, for Vivien. All the joys of love, all the life of\r\npleasure, the participation in his career, the moving many-coloured\r\nexistence to be led by his side--all these were for Vivien. Her heart\r\ncried out in protest at the injustice; she might not even have her\r\nchance! It would be counted treachery if she strove for it, if she\r\nsought to attract Harry or allowed herself to be attracted by him. She\r\nhad to stand aside; she was to be otherwise disposed of, her assent to\r\nthe arrangement being asked so confidently that it could hardly be said\r\nto be asked at all. Suppose she did not assent? Suppose she fought for\r\nherself, treachery or no treachery? Suppose she followed the way of her\r\nfeelings, if so be that they led her towards Harry Belfield? Suppose she\r\nput forth what strength she had to upset Wellgood's plan, to fight for\r\nherself?\r\n\r\nShe played with these questions as she walked up and down the terrace by\r\nthe lake. She declared to herself that she was only playing with them,\r\nbut they would not leave her.\r\n\r\nCertainly the questions found no warrant in Harry Belfield's present\r\nmood. He had made up his mind, his eager blood was running apace. That\r\nvery evening, as his father and he sat alone together after dinner, in\r\nthe long room graced by the two Vandykes which were the boast of Halton,\r\nhe broached the matter in confidence. Mr. Belfield was a frail man of\r\nsixty. He had always been delicate in health, a sufferer from asthma and\r\nprone to chills; but he was no acknowledged invalid, and would not\r\nsubmit to the _role_. He did his share of county work; his judgment was\r\nhighly esteemed, his sense of honour strict and scrupulous. He had a\r\ndryly humorous strain in him, which found food for amusement in his\r\nson's exuberant feelings and dashing impulses, without blinding him to\r\ntheir dangers.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's not a great match, but it's quite satisfactory, Harry.\r\nYou'll find no opposition here. I like her very much, and your mother\r\ndoes too, I know. But\"--he smiled and lifted his brows--\"it's a trifle\r\nsudden, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sudden?\" cried Harry. \"Why, I've known her all my life!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but you haven't been in love with her all your life. And, if\r\nreport speaks true, you have been in love with some other women.\" Mr.\r\nBelfield was a man of the world; his tone was patient and not unduly\r\nsevere as he referred to Harry's adventures of the heart, which had\r\nreached his ears from friends in London.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Harry; \"but those were only--well, passing sort of\r\nthings, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this isn't a passing sort of thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it; I'm dead sure of it. Well, a fellow can't tell\r\nanother--not even his father--what he feels.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, don't try; keep all that for the lady. But if I were you I'd go\r\na bit slow, and I wouldn't tell your mother yet. There's no particular\r\nhurry, is there?\"\r\n\r\nHarry laughed. \"Well, I suppose that depends on how one feels. I happen\r\nto feel rather in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go as slow as you can. Passing things pass: a wife's a more permanent\r\naffair. And undoing a mistake is neither a very easy nor a very savoury\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm absolutely sure. Still I'll try to wait and see if I can manage to\r\nget a little bit surer still, just to please you, pater.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, old boy; I don't think you'll repent it. And, after all, it\r\nmay be as well to give the lady time to get quite sure too--eh?\" His\r\neyes twinkled. He was fully aware that Harry would not think a great\r\ndeal of time necessary for that. \"Oh, by-the-bye,\" he went on, \"I've a\r\nlittle bit of good news for you. I've interceded with your mother on\r\nAndy Hayes' behalf, and her heart is softened. She says she'll be very\r\nglad to see him here--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah! That's very good of the mater.\"\r\n\r\n\"--when we're alone, or have friends who we know won't object.\" He\r\nlaughed a little, and Harry joined in the laugh. \"A prudent woman's\r\nprudent provisoes, Harry! I wish both you and I were as wise as your\r\nmother is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear old Andy--he's getting quite the fashion! I'm to take him to\r\nNutley too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent! Because it looks as if Nutley would be coming here to a\r\ncertain extent in the immediate future, and he'll be able to come when\r\nNutley does.\" He rose from his chair. \"My throat's bothersome to-night;\r\nI'll leave you alone with your cigarette.\"\r\n\r\nHarry smoked a cigarette that seemed to emit clouds of rosy smoke. All\r\nthat lay in the past was forgotten; the future beckoned him to\r\nglittering joys.\r\n\r\n\"Marriage is his best chance, but even that's a considerable chance with\r\nMaster Harry!\" thought his father as he sat down to his book.\r\n\r\nThe one man who had serious fears--or at least doubts--about Harry\r\nBelfield's future was his own father.\r\n\r\n\"I probably shan't live to see the trouble, if any comes,\" he thought.\r\n\"And if his mother does--she won't believe it's his fault.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V.\r\n\r\nBROADENING LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Five all, and deuce!\" cried Wellgood, who had taken on himself the\r\nfunction of umpire. He turned to Isobel and Vivien, who sat by in wicker\r\narmchairs, watching the game. \"I never thought it would be so close.\r\nHayes has pulled up wonderfully!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think Mr. Hayes'll win now,\" said Vivien.\r\n\r\nAn \"exhibition single\" was being played, by request, before the audience\r\nabove indicated. Andy Hayes had protested that, though of course he\r\nwould play if they wished, he could not give Harry a game--he had not\r\nplayed for more than a year. At first it looked as if he were right:\r\nHarry romped away with the first four games, so securely superior that\r\nhe fired friendly chaff at Andy's futile rushes across the court in\r\npursuit of a ball skilfully placed where he least expected it. But in\r\nthe fifth game the rallies became very long; Andy was playing for\r\nsafety--playing deadly safe. He did not try to kill; Harry did, but\r\noften committed suicide. The fifth, the sixth, the seventh game went to\r\nAndy. A flash of brilliancy gave Harry the eighth--five, three! The\r\nninth was his service--he should have had it, and the set. Andy's\r\nreturns were steady, low, all good length, possible to return, almost\r\nimpossible to kill. But Harry tried to kill. Four, five. Andy served,\r\nand found a \"spot\"--at least Harry's malevolent glances at a particular\r\npiece of turf implied a theory that he had. Five all! And now \"Deuce\"!\r\n\r\n\"He's going to lick me, see if he isn't!\" cried Harry Belfield,\r\nperfectly good-natured, but not hiding his opinion that such a result\r\nwould be paradoxical.\r\n\r\nAndy felt terribly ashamed of himself--he wanted to win so much. To play\r\nHarry Belfield on equal terms and beat him, just for once! This spirit\r\nof emulation was new to his soul; it seemed rather alarming when it\r\nthreatened his old-time homage in all things to Harry. Where was\r\nambition going to stop? None the less, eye and hand had no idea of not\r\ndoing their best. A slashing return down the side line and a clever lob\r\ngave him the game--six, five!\r\n\r\nHarry Belfield was the least bit vexed--amusedly vexed. He remembered\r\nAndy's clumsy elephantine sprawlings (no other word for them) about the\r\ncourt when in their boyhood he had first undertaken to teach him the\r\ngame. Andy must have played a lot in Canada.\r\n\r\n\"Now I'll take three off you, Andy,\" he cried, and served a double\r\nfault. The \"gallery\" laughed. \"Oh, damn it!\" exclaimed Harry,\r\nindecorously loud, and served another. Andy could not help laughing--the\r\nfirst time he had ever laughed at Harry Belfield. Given a handicap of\r\nthirty, the game was, barring extraordinary accidents, his. So it\r\nproved. He won it at forty-fifteen, with a stroke that a child ought to\r\nhave returned; Harry put it into the net.\r\n\r\n\"Lost your nerve, Harry?\" said the umpire.\r\n\r\n\"The beggar's such a sticker!\" grumbled Harry, laughing. \"You think\r\nyou've got him licked--and you haven't!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad Mr. Hayes won.\" This from Vivien.\r\n\r\n\"Not only defeated, but forsaken!\" Harry cried. \"Andy, I'll have your\r\nblood!\"\r\n\r\nAndy Hayes laughed joyously. This victory came as an unlooked-for\r\nadornment to a day already notable. A Saturday half-holiday, down from\r\ntown in time to lunch at Nutley, tennis and tea, and the prospect (not\r\nfree from piquant alarm) of dinner at Halton--this was a day for Andy\r\nHayes! With an honest vanity--a vanity based on true affection--he\r\nthought how the account of it would tickle Jack Rock. His life seemed\r\nbroadening out before him, and he would like to tell dear old Jack all\r\nabout it. Playing lawn-tennis at Nutley, dining at Halton--here were\r\nthings just as delightful, just as enlightening, as supping at the great\r\nrestaurant in the company of the Nun and pretty sardonic Miss Dutton. He\r\nowed them all to Harry--he almost wished he had lost the set. At any\r\nrate he felt that he ought to wish it.\r\n\r\n\"It was an awful fluke!\" he protested apologetically.\r\n\r\n\"You'd beat him three times out of five,\" Wellgood asserted in that\r\nconfident tone of his.\r\n\r\nHarry looked a little vexed. He bore an occasional defeat with admirable\r\ngood-nature: to be judged consistently inferior was harder schooling to\r\nhis temper. Triumphing in whatever the contest might be had grown into\r\nsomething of a custom with him. It brooked occasional breaches:\r\nabrogation was another matter. But \"Oh no!\" cried both the girls\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nHarry was on his feet again in a moment. Women's praise was always sweet\r\nto him, and not the less sweet for being open to a suspicion of\r\npartiality--which is, after all, a testimony to achievement in other\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nSuch a partiality accounted for the conviction of Harry's superiority in\r\nVivien's case at least. She had grown up in the midst of the universal\r\nMeriton adoration of him as the most accomplished, the kindest, the\r\nmerriest son of that soil, the child of promise, the present pride and\r\nthe future glory of his native town. Any facts or reports not to the\r\ncredit of the idol or reflecting on his divinity had not reached her\r\ncloistered ears. Wellgood, like Harry's own father, had heard some, but\r\nWellgood held common-sense views even more fully than Mr. Belfield;\r\nfacts were facts, and all men had to be young for a time. Now, if signs\r\nwere to be trusted, if the idol's own words, eyes, and actions meant\r\nwhat she could not but deem they meant (or where stood the idol's\r\nhonesty?), he proposed to ask her to share his throne; he, the adored,\r\noffered adoration--an adoration on a basis of reciprocity, be it\r\nunderstood. She did not grumble at that. To give was so easy, so\r\ninevitable; to receive--to be asked to accept--so wonderful. It could\r\nnot enter her head or her heart to question the value of the gift or to\r\ndoubt the whole-heartedness with which it was bestowed. It was to her so\r\ngreat a thing that she held it must be as great to Harry. Really at the\r\npresent moment it was as great to Harry. His courtship of her seemed a\r\nvery great thing, his absolute exclusive devotion a rare flower of\r\nromance.\r\n\r\nBut she had been glad to see Andy win. Oh yes, she was compassionate.\r\nShe knew so well what it was not to do things as cleverly as other\r\npeople, and how oppressive it felt to be always inferior. Besides Andy\r\nhad a stock of gratitude to draw on; somehow he had, by his solidity,\r\ncaused Curly to appear far less terrible. With a genuine gladness she\r\nsaw him pluck one leaf from Harry's wreath. It must mean so much to Mr.\r\nHayes; it mattered nothing to Harry. Nay, rather, it was an added chance\r\nfor his graces of manner to shine forth.\r\n\r\nThey did shine forth. \"Very good of you, ladies, but I think he holds me\r\nsafe,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't if you'd only play steady,\" Andy observed in his reflective\r\nway. \"Taking chances--that's your fault, Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Taking chances--why, it's life!\" cried Harry, any shadow of vexation\r\nutterly gone and leaving not the smallest memory.\r\n\r\n\"Well, ordinary people can't look at it like that,\" Andy said, with no\r\ntouch of sarcasm, amply acknowledging that Harry and the ordinary were\r\nthings remote from one another.\r\n\r\nWas life taking chances? To one only of the party did that seem really\r\ntrue. Harry had said it, but he was not the one. He was possessed by a\r\nnew triumphant certainty; Wellgood by the thought of a mastery he deemed\r\nalready established, and waiting only for his word to be declared;\r\nVivien by a dream that glowed and glittered, refusing too close a touch\r\nwith earth; Andy by a stout conviction that he must not think about\r\nchances, but work away at his timber (he still called it lumber in his\r\ninner mind) and his books, pausing only to thank heaven for a wonderful\r\nSaturday holiday.\r\n\r\nBut life was taking chances! Supine in her chair, silent since her one\r\nexclamation in championship of Harry Belfield, Isobel Vintry echoed the\r\ncry. Life was taking chances? Yes, any life worth having perhaps was.\r\nBut what if the chances did not come one's way? Who can take what fate\r\nnever offers?\r\n\r\nAll the present party was to meet again at Halton in the evening. It\r\nseemed hardly a separation when Harry and Andy started off together\r\ntowards Meriton, Harry, as usual, chattering briskly, Andy listening,\r\nconsidering, absorbing. At a turn of the road they passed two old\r\nfriends of his, Wat Money, the lawyer's clerk, and Tom Dove, the budding\r\npublican--\"Chinks\" and \"The Bird\" of days of yore.\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon, Mr. Harry! Hullo, Andy!\" said Chinks and the Bird. When\r\nthey were past, the Bird nudged Chinks with his elbow and winked his\r\neye.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he's getting no end of a swell, isn't he?\" said Chinks.\r\n\"Hand-and-glove with Harry Belfield!\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you don't see much of those chaps now?\" Harry was asking Andy\r\nat the same moment. There was just a shadow of admonition in the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I don't. Well, we're all at work. And when I do get a day\r\noff--\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't need to spend it at the Lion!\" laughed Harry. \"As good drink\r\nand better company in other places!\"\r\n\r\nThere were certainly good things to drink and eat at Halton, and Andy\r\ncould not be blamed if he found the company at least as well to his\r\nliking. He had not been there since he was quite a small boy--in the\r\ndays before Nancy Rock migrated from the house next the butcher's shop\r\nin High Street to preside over his home--but he had never forgotten the\r\nhandsome dining-room with its two Vandykes, nor the glass of sherry\r\nwhich Mr. Belfield had once given him there. Mrs. Belfield received him\r\nwith graciousness, Mr. Belfield with cordiality. Of course he was the\r\nfirst to arrive, being very fearful of unpunctuality. Even Harry was not\r\ndown yet. Not being able, for obvious reasons, to ask after her guest's\r\nrelations--her invariable way, when it was possible, of opening a\r\nconversation--Mrs. Belfield expressed her pleasure at seeing him back in\r\nMeriton.\r\n\r\n\"My husband thinks you're such a good companion for Harry,\" she added,\r\nshowing that her pleasure was genuine, even if somewhat interested.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Hayes,\" said Mr. Belfield. \"See all you can of him; we shall be\r\ngrateful. He wants just what a steady-going sensible fellow, as\r\neverybody says you are, can give him--a bit of ballast, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everybody\" had been, in fact, Jack Rock, but--again for obvious\r\nreasons--the authority was not cited by name.\r\n\r\n\"You may be sure I shall give him as much of my company as he'll take,\r\nsir,\" said Andy, infinitely pleased, enormously complimented.\r\n\r\nPlacidity was Mrs. Belfield's dominant note--a soothing placidity. She\r\nwas rather short and rather plump--by no means an imposing figure; but\r\nthis quality gave her a certain dignity, and even a certain power in her\r\nlittle world. People let her have her own way because she was so\r\nplacidly sure that they would, and it seemed almost profane to disturb\r\nthe placidity. Even her husband's humour was careful to stop short of\r\nthat. Her physical movements were in harmony with her temper--leisurely,\r\nsmooth, noiseless; her voice was gentle, low, and even. She seemed to\r\nAndy to fit in well with the life she lived and always had lived, to be\r\na good expression or embodiment of its sheltered luxury and sequestered\r\ntranquillity. Storms and stress and struggles--these things had nothing\r\nto do with Mrs. Belfield, and really ought to have none; they would be\r\nquite out of keeping with her. She seemed to have a right to ask that\r\nthings about her should go straight and go quietly. There was perhaps a\r\nflavour of selfishness about this disposition; certainly an\r\ninaccessibility to strong feeling. For instance, while placidly assuming\r\nHarry's success and Harry's career, she was not excited nor what would\r\nbe called enthusiastic about them--not half so excited and enthusiastic\r\nas Andy Hayes.\r\n\r\nThe dinner in the fine old room, under the Vandykes, with Mrs. Belfield\r\nin her lavender silk and precious lace, the girls in their white frocks,\r\nthe old silver, the wealth of flowers, seemed rather wonderful to Andy\r\nHayes. His life in boyhood had been poor and meagre, in manhood hard and\r\nrough. Here was a side of existence he had not seen; as luxurious as the\r\nlife of which he had caught a glimpse at the great restaurant, but far\r\nmore serene, more dignified. His opening mind received another new\r\nimpression and a rarely attractive one.\r\n\r\nBut the centre of the scene for him was Vivien Wellgood. From his first\r\nsight of her in the drawing-room he could not deny that. He had never\r\nseen her in the evening before, and it was in the evening that her frail\r\nbeauty showed forth. She was like a thing of gossamer that a touch would\r\nspoil. She was so white in her low-cut frock; all so white save for a\r\nlittle glow on the cheeks that excitement and pleasure brought, save for\r\nthe brightness of her hair in the soft candle light, save for the dark\r\nblue eyes which seemed to keep watch and ward over her hidden thoughts.\r\nYes, she was--why, she was good enough for Harry--good enough for Harry\r\nBelfield himself! And he, Andy, Harry's faithful follower and\r\nworshipper, would worship her too, if she would let him (Harry, he knew,\r\nwould), if she would not be afraid of him, not dislike him or shrink\r\nfrom him. That was all he asked, having in his mind not only a bashful\r\nconsciousness of his rude strength and massive frame--they seemed almost\r\nthreatening beside her delicacy--but also a haunting recollection that\r\nshe could not endure such a number of things, including butchers' shops.\r\n\r\nNo thought for himself, no thought of trying to rival Harry, so much as\r\ncrossed his mind. If it had, it would have been banished as rank\r\ntreachery; but it could not, for the simple reason that his attitude\r\ntowards Harry made such an idea utterly foreign to his thoughts. He was\r\nnot asking, as Isobel Vintry had asked that afternoon, why he might not\r\nhave his chance. It was not the way of his nature to put forward claims\r\nfor himself--and, above all, claims that conflicted with Harry's claims.\r\nThe bare notion was to him impossible.\r\n\r\nHe sat by her, but for some time she gave herself wholly to listening to\r\nHarry, who had found, on getting home, a letter from Billy Foot, full of\r\nthe latest political gossip from town. But presently, the conversation\r\ndrifting into depths of politics where she could not follow, she turned\r\nto Andy and said, \"I'm getting on much better with Curly. I pat him\r\nnow!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right. It's only his fun.\"\r\n\r\n\"People's fun is sometimes the worst thing about them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well now, that's true,\" Andy acknowledged, rather surprised to hear the\r\nremark from her.\r\n\r\n\"But I am getting on much better. And--well, rather better at riding.\"\r\nShe smiled at him in confidence. \"And nobody's said anything about\r\nswimming. Do you know, when I feel myself inclined to get frightened, I\r\nthink about you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you find it helps?\" asked Andy, much amused and rather pleased.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's like thinking of a policeman in the middle of the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I do look rather like a policeman,\" said Andy reflectively.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you do! That's it, I think.\" The vague \"it\" seemed to signify the\r\nexplanation of the confidence Andy inspired.\r\n\r\n\"And how about dust and dirt, and getting very hot?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Isobel says I'm a bit better about courage, but not the least about\r\nfastidiousness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fastidiousness suits some people, Miss Wellgood.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't suit father, not in me,\" she murmured with a woeful smile.\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't thinking about me help you there? On the same principle it\r\nought to.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't,\" she murmured, with a trace of confusion, and suddenly her\r\neyes went blank. Something was in her thoughts that she did not want\r\nAndy to see. Was it the butcher's shop? Andy's wits were not quick\r\nenough to ask the question; but he saw that her confidential mood had\r\nsuffered a check.\r\n\r\nHer confidence had been very pleasant, but there were other things to\r\nlisten to at the table. Andy was heart-whole and intellectually\r\nvoracious.\r\n\r\nThey, the rest of the company, had begun on politics--imperial\r\npolitics--and had discussed them not without some friction. No Radical\r\nwas present--_Procul, O procul este, profani!_--but Wellgood had the\r\nperversities of his anti-sentimental attitude. A Tory at home, why was\r\nhe to be a democrat--or a Socialist--at the Antipodes? Competition and\r\nself-interest were the golden rule in England; was there to be another\r\nbetween England and her colonies? The tie of blood--one flag, one crown,\r\none destiny--Wellgood suspected his bugbear in every one of these cries.\r\nNothing for nothing--and for sixpence no more than the coin was\r\nworth--with a preference for five penn'orth if you could get out of it\r\nat that! He stood steady on his firmly-rooted narrow foundation.\r\n\r\nAll of Harry was on fire against him. Was blood nothing--race,\r\ncolour, memories, associations, the Flag, the Crown, and the Destiny?\r\nA destiny to rule, or at least to manage, the planet! Mother and\r\nDaughters--nothing in that?\r\n\r\nThings were getting hot, and the ladies, who always like to look on at\r\nthe men fighting, much interested. Mr. Belfield, himself no politician,\r\nrather a student of human nature and addicted to the Socratic attitude\r\n(so justly vexatious to practical men who have to do something, good,\r\nbad, or if not better, at least more plausible, than nothing) interposed\r\na suggestion.\r\n\r\n\"Mother and daughters? Hasn't husband and wives become a more\r\nappropriate parallel?\" He smiled across the table at his own wife. \"No\r\npersonal reference, my dear! But an attitude of independence, without\r\nany particular desire to pay the bills? Oh, I'm only asking questions!\"\r\n\r\nAndy was listening hard now. So was Vivien, for she saw Harry's eyes\r\nalight and his mouth eager to utter truths that should save the nation.\r\n\r\n\"If we could reach,\" said Harry, marvellously handsome, somewhat\r\nrhetorical for a small party, \"if only we could once reach a true\r\nunderstanding between ourselves and the self-governing--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but that's going beyond my parallel, my dear boy,\" his father\r\ninterrupted. \"If marriage demanded mutual understanding, what man or\r\nwoman could risk it with eyes open?\"\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't it?\" Isobel Vintry was the questioner.\r\n\r\n\"Heavens, no, my dear Miss Vintry! Something much less, something much\r\nless fundamentally impossible. A good temper and a bad memory, that's\r\nall!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well done, pater!\" cried Harry, readily switched off from his heated\r\nenthusiasm. \"Which for the husband, which for the wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Both for both, Harry. Toleration to-day, and an unlimited power of\r\noblivion to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"What nonsense you're talking, dear,\" placidly smiled Mrs. Belfield.\r\n\r\n\"I'm exactly defining your own characteristics,\" he replied. \"If you do\r\nthat to a woman, she always says you're talking nonsense.\"\r\n\r\n\"An unlimited supply of the water of Lethe, pater? That does it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's about it, Harry. If you mix it with a little sound Scotch whisky\r\nbefore you go to bed--\"\r\n\r\nAndy burst into a good guffaw; the kindly mocking humour pleased him.\r\nVivien was alert too; there was nothing to frighten, much to enjoy; the\r\nglow deepened on her cheeks.\r\n\r\nBut Wellgood was not content; he was baulked of his argument, of his\r\nfight.\r\n\r\n\"We've wandered from the point,\" he said dourly. (\"As if wanderings were\r\nnot the best things in the world!\" thought more than one of the party,\r\nmore or less explicitly.) \"We give, they take.\" He was back to the\r\nUnited Kingdom and the Colonies.\r\n\r\n\"Could anything be more nicely exact to my parallel?\" asked Belfield,\r\nsocratically smiling. \"Did you ever know a marriage where each partner\r\ndidn't say, 'I give, you take'? Some add that they're content with the\r\narrangement, others don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pater, you always mix up different things,\" Harry protested, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"I'm always trying to find out whether there are any different things,\r\nHarry.\" He smiled at his son. \"Wives, that's what they are! And several\r\nof them! Harry, we're in for all the difficulties of polygamy! A\r\npreference to one--oh no, I'm not spelling it with a big P! But--well,\r\nthe ladies ought to be able to help us here. Could you share a heart,\r\nMiss Vintry?\"\r\n\r\nIsobel's white was relieved with gold trimmings; she looked sumptuous.\r\n\"I shouldn't like it,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"What has all this got to do with the practical problem?\" Wellgood\r\ndemanded. \"Our trade with the Colonies is no more than thirty per\r\ncent--\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you, Mr. Wellgood. The gentlemen had much better have kept\r\nto their politics,\" Mrs. Belfield interposed with suave placidity. \"They\r\nunderstand them. When they begin to talk about women--\"\r\n\r\n\"Need of Lethe--whisky and Lethe-water!\" chuckled Harry. \"In a large\r\nglass, eh, Andy?\"\r\n\r\nWellgood turned suddenly on Andy. \"You've lived in Canada. What do you\r\nsay?\"\r\n\r\nAndy had been far too much occupied in listening. Besides, he was no\r\npolitician. He thought deeply for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"A lot depends on whether you want to buy or to sell.\" He delivered\r\nhimself of this truth quite solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"A very far-reaching observation,\" said Mr. Belfield. \"Goes to the root\r\nof human traffic, and, quite possibly, to that of both the institutions\r\nwhich we have been discussing. I wonder whether either will be\r\npermanent!\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, pater, we're at dessert! Aren't you starting rather big\r\nsubjects?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father likes to amuse himself with curious ideas,\" Mrs. Belfield\r\nremarked. \"So did my father; he once asked me what I thought would\r\nhappen if I didn't say my prayers. Men like to ask questions like that,\r\nbut I never pay much attention to them. Shall we go into the\r\ndrawing-room, Vivien? It may be warm enough for a turn in the garden,\r\nperhaps.\" She addressed the men. \"Bring your cigars and try.\"\r\n\r\nThe men were left alone. \"The garden would be jolly,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\nMr. Belfield coughed, and suddenly wheezed. \"Intimations of mortality!\"\r\nhe said apologetically. \"We've talked of a variety of subjects--to\r\nlittle purpose, I suppose. But it's entertaining to survey the field of\r\nhumanity. Your views were briefly expressed, Hayes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everybody else was talking such a lot, sir,\" said Andy.\r\n\r\nBelfield's humorous laugh was entangled in a cough. \"You'll never get\r\nthat obstacle out of the way of your oratory,\" he managed to stutter\r\nout. \"They always are! Talk rules the world--eh, Wellgood?\" He was\r\nmaliciously provocative.\r\n\r\n\"We wait till they've finished talking. Then we do what we want,\" said\r\nWellgood. \"Force rules in the end--the readiness to kill and be killed.\r\nThat's the _ultima ratio_, the final argument.\"\r\n\r\n\"The women say that's out of date.\"\r\n\r\n\"The women!\" exclaimed Wellgood contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\"They'll be in the garden,\" Harry opined. \"Shall we move, pater?\"\r\n\r\n\"We might as well,\" said Belfield. \"Are you ready, Wellgood?\"\r\n\r\nWellgood was ready--in spite of his contempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI.\r\n\r\nTHE WORLDS OF MERITON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe garden at Halton was a pleasant place on a fine evening, with a moon\r\nwaxing, yet not obtrusively full, with billowing shrubberies, clear-cut\r\nwalks, lawns spreading in a gentle drabness that would be bright green\r\nin to-morrow's sun--a place pleasant in its calm, its spaciousness and\r\nisolation. They all sat together in a ring for a while; smoke curled up;\r\na servant brought glasses that clinked as they were set down with a\r\ncheery, yet not urgent, suggestion.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you're right to go in for it,\" said Wellgood to Harry. \"It's\r\nyour obvious line.\" (He was referring to a public career.) \"But, after\r\nall, it's casting pearls before swine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Swine!\" The note of exclamation was large. \"Our masters, Mr. Wellgood!\"\r\n\r\n\"A decent allowance of bran, and a ring through their noses--that's the\r\nthing for them!\"\r\n\r\n\"Has anybody got a copy--well, another copy of 'Coriolanus'?\" Harry\r\ninquired in an affectation of eagerness.\r\n\r\n\"Casting pearls before swine is bad business, of course,\" said Belfield\r\nin his husky voice--he was really unwise to be out of doors at all; \"but\r\nthere are degrees of badness. If your pearls are indifferent as pearls,\r\nand your swine admirable as swine? And that's often the truth of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"My husband is sometimes perverse in his talk, my dear,\" said Mrs.\r\nBelfield, aside to Vivien, to whom she was being very kind. \"You needn't\r\nnotice what he says.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's rather amusing,\" Vivien ventured, not quite sure whether the\r\nadjective were respectful enough.\r\n\r\n\"Andy, pronounce!\" cried Harry Belfield; for his friend sat in his usual\r\nmeditative absorbing silence.\r\n\r\n\"If I had to, I'd like to say a word from the point of view of\r\nthe--swine.\" Had the moon been stronger, he might have been seen to\r\nblush. \"I don't want to be--oh, well, serious. That's rot, I know--after\r\ndinner. But--well, you're all in it--insiders--I'm an outsider. And I\r\nsay that what the swine want is--pearls!\"\r\n\r\n\"If we've got them?\" The question, or insinuation, was Belfield's. He\r\nwas looking at Andy with a real, if an only half-serious, interest.\r\n\r\n\"Swine are swine,\" remarked Wellgood. \"They mustn't forget it. Neither\r\nmust we.\"\r\n\r\n\"But pearls by no means always pearls?\" Belfield suggested. \"Though they\r\nmay look the real thing if a pretty woman hangs them round her neck.\"\r\n\r\nTheir talk went only for an embellishment of their general state--so\r\ncomfortable, so serene, so exceptionally fortunate. Were not they\r\npearls? Andy had seen something of the swine, had perhaps even been one\r\nof them. A vague protest stirred in him; were they not too serene, too\r\ncomfortable, too fortunate? Yet he loved it all; it was beautiful. How\r\nmany uglies go to make one beautiful? It is a bit of social arithmetic.\r\nWhen you have got the result, the deduction may well seem difficult.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't much matter whether they're real or not, if a really pretty\r\nwoman hangs them round her neck,\" Harry laughed. \"The neck carries the\r\npearls!\"\r\n\r\n\"But we'd all rather they were real,\" said Isobel Vintry suddenly, the\r\nfirst of the women to intervene. \"Other women guess, you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it hurt so much if they do?\" Belfield asked.\r\n\r\n\"The only thing that really does hurt,\" Isobel assured him, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear, how disproportionate!\" sighed Mrs. Belfield.\r\n\r\n\"I'd never have anything false about me--pearls, or lace, or hair,\r\nor--or anything about me,\" exclaimed Vivien. \"I should hate it!\" Feeling\r\ncarried her into sudden unexpected speech.\r\n\r\nVery gradually, very tentatively, Andy was finding himself able to speak\r\nin this sort of company, to speak as an equal to equals, not socially\r\nonly, but in an intellectual regard.\r\n\r\n\"Riches seem to me all wrong, but what they produce, leaving out the\r\nwasters, all right.\" He let it out, apprehensive of a censuring silence.\r\nBelfield relieved him in a minute.\r\n\r\n\"I'm with you. I always admire most the things to which I'm on principle\r\nopposed--a melancholy state of one's mental interior! Kings, lords, and\r\nbishops--crowns, coronets, and aprons--all very attractive and\r\npicturesque!\"\r\n\r\n\"We all know that the governor's a crypto-Radical,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\n\"I thought Carlyle, among others, had taught that we were all Radicals\r\nwhen in our pyjamas--or less,\" said Belfield. \"But that's not the point.\r\nThe excellence of things that are wrong, the narrowness of the moral\r\nview!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear! Oh, well, my dear!\" murmured Mrs. Belfield.\r\n\r\n\"I've got a touch of asthma--I must say what I like.\" Belfield\r\nhumorously traded on his infirmity. \"A dishonest fellow who won't pay\r\nhis tradesmen, a flirtatious minx who will make mischief, a spoilt\r\nurchin who insists on doing what he shouldn't--all rather attractive,\r\naren't they? If everybody behaved properly we should have no\r\n'situations.' What would become of literature and the drama?\"\r\n\r\n\"And if nobody had any spare cash, what would become of them, either?\"\r\nasked Harry.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we could do with a good deal less of them. I'll go so far as to\r\nadmit that,\" said Wellgood.\r\n\r\nBelfield laughed. \"Even from Wellgood we've extracted one plea for the\r\nredistribution of wealth. A dialectical triumph! Let's leave it at\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Belfield carried her husband off indoors; Wellgood went with them,\r\nchallenging his host to a game of bezique; Harry invited Vivien to a\r\nstroll; Isobel Vintry and Andy were left together. She asked him a\r\nsudden question:\r\n\r\n\"Do you think Harry Belfield a selfish man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Selfish! Harry? Heavens, no! He'd do anything for his friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean quite in that way. I daresay he would--and, of course,\r\nhe's too well-mannered to be selfish about trifles. But I suppose even\r\nto ask questions about him is treason to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, a little bit,\" laughed Andy. \"I'm an old follower, you see!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and he thinks it natural you should be,\" she suggested quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if it is natural, why shouldn't he think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems natural to him that he should always come first, and--and have\r\nthe pick of things.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean he's spoilt? According to his father, that makes him more\r\nattractive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm not saying it doesn't do that. Only--do you never mind it?\r\nNever mind playing second fiddle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Second fiddle seems rather a high position. I hardly reckon myself in\r\nthe orchestra at all,\" he laughed. \"You remember--I'm accustomed to\r\nfollowing the hunt on foot.\"\r\n\r\n\"While Harry Belfield rides! Yes! Vivien rides too--and doesn't like\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\nShe was bending forward in her chair, handsome, sumptuous in her white\r\nand gold (Wellgood had made her a present the quarter-day before), with\r\nher smile very bitter. The smile told that she spoke with a meaning more\r\nthan literal. Andy surveyed, at his leisure, possible metaphorical\r\nbearings.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I think I see,\" he announced, after an interval fully\r\nperceptible. \"You mean she doesn't really appreciate her advantages? By\r\nriding you mean--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, really, Mr. Hayes!\" She broke into vexed amused laughter. \"I\r\nmustn't try it any more with you,\" she declared.\r\n\r\n\"But I shall understand if you give me time to think it over,\" Andy\r\nprotested. \"Don't rush me, that's all, Miss Vintry.\"\r\n\r\n\"As if I could rush any one or anything!\" she said, handsome still, now\r\nhandsomely despairing.\r\n\r\nTo Andy she was a problem, needing time to think over; to Wellgood she\r\nwas a postulate, assumed not proved, yet assumed to be proved; to Harry\r\nshe was--save for that subtle momentary feeling on the terrace by the\r\nlake--Vivien's companion. She wanted to be something other than any of\r\nthese. Follow the hounds on foot? She would know what it was to ride!\r\nKnow and not like--in Vivien's fashion? Andy, slowly digesting, saw her\r\nlips curve in that bitter smile again.\r\n\r\nFrom a path near by, yet secluded behind a thick trim hedge of yew,\r\nthere sounded a girl's nervous flutter of a laugh, a young man's\r\nexultant merriment. Harry and Vivien, not far away, seemed the space of\r\na world apart--to Isobel; Andy was normally conscious that they were not\r\nmore than twenty yards off, and almost within hearing if they spoke. But\r\nhe had been getting at Isobel's meaning--slowly and surely.\r\n\r\n\"Being able to ride--having the opportunity--and not caring--that's\r\npearls before--?\"\r\n\r\n\"I congratulate you, Mr. Hayes. I can imagine you making a very good\r\nspeech--after the election is over!\"\r\n\r\nAndy laughed heartily, leaning back in his chair.\r\n\r\n\"That's jolly good, Miss Vintry!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Ten minutes after the poll closed you'd begin to persuade the\r\nelectors!\" She spoke rather lower. \"Ten minutes after a girl had taken\r\nanother man, you'd--\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me time! I've never thought about myself like that,\" cried Andy.\r\n\r\nNo more sounds from the path behind the yew hedge. She was impatient\r\nwith Andy--would Harry never come back from that path?\r\n\r\nHe came back the next moment--he and Vivien. Vivien's face was a\r\nconfession, Harry's air a self-congratulation.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you've been making yourself amusing, Andy?\" asked Harry. His\r\ntone conveyed a touch of amusement at the idea of Andy being amusing.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Vintry's been pitching into me like anything,\" said Andy, smiling\r\nbroadly. \"She says I'm always a day after the fair. I'm going to think\r\nit over--and try to get a move on.\"\r\n\r\nHis good-nature, his simplicity, his serious intention to attempt\r\nself-improvement, tickled Harry intensely. Why, probably Isobel had\r\nwanted to flirt, and Andy had failed to play up to her! He burst into a\r\nlaugh; Vivien's laugh followed as an applauding echo.\r\n\r\n\"A lecture, was it, Miss Vintry?\" Harry asked in banter.\r\n\r\n\"I could give you one too,\" said Isobel, colouring a little.\r\n\r\n\"She gives me plenty!\" Vivien remarked, with a solemnly comic shake of\r\nher head.\r\n\r\n\"It's my business in life,\" said Isobel.\r\n\r\nJust for a second Harry looked at her; an impish smile was on his lips.\r\nDid she think that, was she honest about it? Or was she provocative? It\r\ncrossed Harry's mind--past experiences facilitating the transit of the\r\nidea--that she might be saying to him, \"Is that all a young woman of my\r\nlooks is good for? To give lectures?\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall give me one at the earliest opportunity, if you'll be so\r\nkind,\" he laughed, his eyes boldly conveying that he would enjoy the\r\nlesson. Vivien laughed again; it was great fun to see Harry chaffing\r\nIsobel! She liked Isobel, but was in awe of her. Had not Isobel all the\r\ndifficult virtues which it was her own woeful task to learn? But Harry\r\ncould chaff her--Harry could do anything.\r\n\r\n\"If I do, I'll teach you something you don't know, Mr. Harry,\" Isobel\r\nsaid, letting her eyes meet his with a boldness equal to his own. Again\r\nthat subtle feeling touched him, as it had on the terrace by the lake.\r\n\r\n\"I'm ready to learn my lesson,\" he assured her, with a challenging gleam\r\nin his eye.\r\n\r\nShe nodded rather scornfully, but accepting his challenge. There was a\r\nlast bit of by-play between their eyes.\r\n\r\n\"It's really time to go, if Mr. Wellgood has finished his game,\" said\r\nIsobel, rising.\r\n\r\nThe insinuation of the words, the by-play of the eyes, had passed over\r\nVivien's head and outside the limits of Andy's perspicacity. To both of\r\nthem the bandying of words was but chaff; by both the exchange of\r\nglances went unmarked. Well, the whole thing was no more than chaff to\r\nHarry himself; such chaff as he was very good at, a practised hand--and\r\nnot ignorant of why the chaff was pleasant. And Isobel? Oh yes, she\r\nknew! Harry was amused to find this knowledge in Vivien's\r\ncompanion--this provocation, this freemasonry of flirtation. Poor old\r\nAndy had, of course, seen none of it! Well, perhaps it needed a bit of\r\nexperience--besides the temperament.\r\n\r\nIndoors, farewell was soon said--hours ruled early at Meriton. Soon\r\nsaid, yet not without some significance in the saying. Mrs. Belfield was\r\nopenly affectionate to Vivien, and Belfield paternal in a courtly way;\r\nHarry very devoted to the same young lady, yet with a challenging\r\n\"aside\" of his eyes for Isobel; Andy brimming over with a vain effort to\r\nexpress adequately but without gush his thanks for the evening.\r\nBelfield, being two pounds the better of Wellgood over their bezique,\r\nwas in more than his usual good-temper--it was spiced with malice, for\r\nthe defeat of Wellgood (a bad loser) counted for more than the forty\r\nshillings--and gave Andy his hand and a pat on the back.\r\n\r\n\"It's not often one has to tell a man not to undervalue himself,\" he\r\nremarked. \"But I fancy I might say that to you. Well, I'm no prophet;\r\nbut at any rate be sure you're always welcome at this house for your own\r\nsake, as well as for Harry's.\"\r\n\r\nGetting into the carriage with Isobel and her father, Vivien felt like\r\ngoing back to school. But in all likelihood she would see Harry's eyes\r\nagain to-morrow. She did not forget to give a kindly glance to solid\r\nAndy Hayes--not exciting, nor bewildering, nor inflaming (as another\r\nwas!), but somehow comforting and reassuring to think of. She sat down\r\non the narrow seat, fronting her father and Isobel. Yes--but school\r\nwouldn't last much longer! And after school? Ineffable heaven! Being\r\nwith Harry, loving Harry, being loved by--? That vaulting imagination\r\nseemed still almost--nay, it seemed quite--impossible. Yet if your own\r\neyes assure you of things impossible--well, there's a good case for\r\nbelieving your eyes, and the belief is pleasant. Wellgood sore over his\r\ntwo pounds, Isobel dissatisfied with fate but challenging it, sat\r\nsilent. The young girl's lips curved in sweet memories and triumphant\r\nanticipations. The best thing in the world--was it actually to be hers?\r\nAlmost she knew it, though she would not own to the knowledge yet.\r\n\r\nHappy was she in the handkerchief flung by her hero! Happy was Harry\r\nBelfield in the ready devotion, the innocent happy surrender, of one\r\ngirl, and the vexed challenge of another whom he had--whom he had at\r\nleast meant to ignore; he could never answer for it that he would quite\r\nignore a woman who displayed such a challenge in the lists of sex. But\r\nthere was a happier being still among those who left Halton that night.\r\nIt was Andy Hayes, before whom life had opened so, who had enjoyed such\r\na wonderful day-off, who had been told not to undervalue himself, had\r\nbeen reproached with being a day after the fair, had undergone (as it\r\nseemed) an initiation into a life of which he had hardly dreamt, yet of\r\nwhich he appeared, in that one summer's day, to have been accepted as a\r\npart.\r\n\r\nYes, Andy was on the whole the happiest--happier even than Harry, to\r\nwhom content, triumph, and challenge were all too habitual; happier even\r\nthan Vivien, who had still some schooling to endure, still some of\r\nlove's finicking doubts, some of hope's artificially prudent\r\nincredulity, to overcome; beyond doubt happier than Wellgood, who had\r\nlost two pounds, or Isobel Vintry, who had challenged and had been told\r\nthat her challenge should be taken up--some day! Mrs. Belfield was\r\nintent on sleeping well, as she always did; Mr. Belfield on not coughing\r\ntoo much--as he generally did. They were not competitors in happiness.\r\n\r\nAndy walked home. Halton lay half a mile outside the town; his lodgings\r\nwere at the far end of High Street. All through the long, broad,\r\nfamiliar street--in old days he had known who lived in well-nigh every\r\nhouse--his road lay. He walked home under the stars. The day had been\r\nwonderful; they who had figured in it peopled his brain--delicate dainty\r\nVivien first; with her, brilliant Harry; that puzzling Miss Vintry; Mr.\r\nBelfield, who talked so whimsically and had told him not to undervalue\r\nhimself; Wellgood, grim, hard, merciless, yet somehow with the stamp of\r\na man about him; Mrs. Belfield serenely matching with her house, her\r\nVandykes, her garden, and the situation to which it had pleased Heaven\r\nto call her. Soberly now--soberly now--had he ever expected to be a part\r\nof all this?\r\n\r\nHigh Street lay dark and quiet. It was eleven o'clock. He passed the old\r\ngrammar school with a thought of the dear old father--B.A. Oxon, which\r\nhad something to do with his wonderful day. He passed the Lion, where\r\n\"the Bird\" officiated, and Mr. Foulkes' office, where \"Chinks\" aspired\r\nto become \"gentleman, one etc.\"--so runs the formula that gives a\r\nsolicitor his status. All dark! Now if by chance Jack Rock were up, and\r\nwilling to listen to a little honest triumphing! It had been a day to\r\ntalk about.\r\n\r\nYes, Jack was up; his parlour lights glowed cosily behind red blinds.\r\nYet Andy was not to have a clear field for the recital of his\r\nadventures; it was no moment for an exhibition of his honest pride,\r\nbased on an unimpaired humility. Jack Rock had a party. The table was\r\nfurnished with beer, whisky, gin, tobacco, and clay pipes. Round it sat\r\nold friends--Chinks and the Bird; the Bird's father, Mr. Dove, landlord\r\nof the Lion; and Cox, the veterinary surgeon. After the labours of the\r\nweek they were having a little \"fling\" on Saturday night--convivially,\r\nyet in all reasonable temperance. The elder men--Jack, Mr. Dove, and\r\nCox--greeted Andy with intimate and affectionate cordiality; a certain\r\nconstraint marked the manner of Chinks and the Bird--they could not\r\nforget the afternoon's encounter. His evening coat too, and his\r\nshirt-front! Everybody marked them; but they had a notion that he might\r\nhave caught that habit in London.\r\n\r\nAndy's welcome over, Mr. Dove of the Lion took up his tale at the point\r\nat which he had left it. Mr. Dove had not Jack Rock's education--he had\r\nnever been at the grammar school but he was a shrewd sensible old\r\nfellow, who prided himself on the respectability of his \"house\" and felt\r\nhis responsibilities as a publican without being too fond of the folk\r\nwho were always dinning them into his ears.\r\n\r\n\"I says to the girl, 'We don't want no carryings-on at the Lion.' That's\r\nwhat I says, Jack. She says, 'That wasn't nothing, Mr. Dove--only a give\r\nand take o' nonsense. The bar between us too! W'ere's the 'arm?' 'I\r\ndon't like it, Miss Miles,' I says, 'I don't like it, that's all.' 'Oh,\r\nvery good, Mr. Dove! You're master 'ere, o' course; only, if you won't\r\n'ave that, you won't keep up your takings, that's all!' That's the way\r\nshe put it, Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bit of truth in it, perhaps,\" Jack opined.\r\n\r\n\"There's a lot of truth in it,\" said the Bird solemnly. \"Fellers like to\r\nshow off before a good-looking girl--whether she's behind a bar or\r\nwhether she ain't.\"\r\n\r\n\"If there never 'adn't been barmaids, I wouldn't be the one to begin\r\nit,\" said Mr. Dove. \"I knows its difficulties. But there they are--all\r\nthem nice girls bred to it! What are ye to do with 'em, Jack?\"\r\n\r\n\"A drink doesn't taste any worse for being 'anded--handed--to you by a\r\npretty girl,\" said Chinks with a knowing chuckle.\r\n\r\n\"Then you give 'er one--then you stand me one--then you 'ave another\r\nyourself--just to say 'Blow the expense!' Oh, the girl knew the way of\r\nit--I ain't saying she didn't!\" Mr. Dove smoked fast, evidently puzzled\r\nin his mind. \"And she's a good girl 'erself too, ain't she, Tom?\"\r\n\r\nTom blushed--blushed very visibly. Miss Miles was not a subject of\r\nindifference to the Bird.\r\n\r\n\"She's very civil-spoken,\" he mumbled shamefacedly.\r\n\r\n\"That she is--and a fine figure of a girl too,\" added Jack Rock. \"Know\r\nher, Andy?\"\r\n\r\nWell, no! Andy did not know her; he felt profoundly apologetic. Miss\r\nMiles was evidently a person whom one ought to know, if one would be in\r\nthe world of Meriton. The world of Meriton? It came home to him that\r\nthere was more than one.\r\n\r\nMr. Cox was a man who listened--in that respect rather like Andy\r\nhimself; but, when he did speak, he was in the habit of giving a\r\nverdict, therein deviating from Andy's humble way.\r\n\r\n\"Barmaids oughtn't to a' come into existence,\" he said. \"Being there,\r\nthey're best left--under supervision.\" He nodded at old Dove, as though\r\nto say, \"You won't get any further than that if you talk all night,\" and\r\nput his pipe back into his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"The doctor's right, I daresay,\" said old Dove in a tone of relief. It\r\nis always something of a comfort to be told that one's problems are\r\ninsoluble; the obligation of trying to solve them is thereby removed.\r\n\r\nJack accepted this ending to the discussion.\r\n\r\n\"And what have you been doing with yourself, Andy?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nAndy found a curious difficulty in answering. Tea and tennis at Nutley,\r\ndinner at Halton--it seemed impossible to speak the words without\r\nself-consciousness. He felt that Chinks and the Bird had their eyes on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Been at work all the week, Jack. Had a day-off to-day.\"\r\n\r\nLuckily Jack fastened on the first part of his answer. He turned a keen\r\nglance on Andy. \"Business doin' well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not particularly,\" Andy confessed. \"It's a bit hard for a new-comer to\r\nestablish a connection.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right there, Andy,\" commented old Mr. Dove, serenely happy in\r\nthe knowledge of an ancient and good connection attaching to the Lion.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, not particularly well?\" Jack nodded with an air of what looked like\r\nsatisfaction, though it would not be kind to Andy to be satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"Playing lawn-tennis at Nutley, weren't you?\" asked Chinks suddenly.\r\n\r\nAll faces turned to Andy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I was, Chinks,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Half expected you to supper, Andy,\" said Jack Rock.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, Jack. I would have come if I'd been free. But--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, where were you?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it.\r\n\r\n\"I was dining out, Jack.\"\r\n\r\nAndy's tone became as airy as he could make it, as careless, as natural.\r\nHis effort in this kind was not a great success.\r\n\r\n\"Harry Belfield asked me to Halton.\"\r\n\r\nA short silence followed. They were good fellows, one and all of them;\r\nnobody had a jibe for him; the envy, if envy there were, was even as his\r\nown for Harry Belfield. Cox looked round and raised his glass.\r\n\r\n\"'Ere's to you, Andy! You went to the war, you went to foreign parts. If\r\nyou've learned a bit and got on a bit, nobody in Meriton's goin' to\r\ngrudge it you--least of all them as knew your good father, who was a\r\ngentleman if ever there was one--and I've known some of the best,\r\nconsequent on my business layin' mainly with 'orses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dined at Halton, did you?\" Old Jack Rock beamed, then suddenly grew\r\nthoughtful.\r\n\r\n\"Well, of course, I've always known Harry Belfield, and--\" He was\r\napologizing.\r\n\r\n\"The old gentleman used to dine there--once a year reg'lar,\" Jack\r\nreminded him. \"Quite right of 'em to keep it up with you.\" But still\r\nJack looked thoughtful.\r\n\r\nEleven-thirty sounded from the squat tower of the long low church which\r\npresided over the west end--the Fyfold end--of High Street. Old Cox\r\nknocked out his pipe decisively. \"Bedtime!\" he pronounced.\r\n\r\nNobody contested the verdict. Only across Andy's mind flitted an\r\noutlandish memory that it was the hour at which one sat down to supper\r\nat the great restaurant--with Harry, the Nun, sardonic Miss Dutton,\r\nBilly Foot, and London at large--and at liberty.\r\n\r\n\"You stop a bit, my lad,\" said Jack with affection, also with a touch of\r\nold-time authority. \"I've something to say to you, Andy.\"\r\n\r\nAndy stayed willingly enough; he liked Jack, and he was loth to end that\r\nday.\r\n\r\nJack filled and pressed, lit, pressed, and lit again, a fresh clay pipe.\r\n\r\n\"You like all that sort of thing, Andy?\" he asked. \"Oh, you know what I\r\nmean--what you've been doin' to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I like it, Jack.\" Andy saw that his dear old friend--dear Nancy's\r\nbrother--had something of moment on his mind.\r\n\r\n\"But it don't count in the end. It's not business, Andy.\" Jack's tone\r\nhad become, suddenly and strangely, persuasive, reasonably\r\npersuasive--almost what one might call coaxing.\r\n\r\n\"I've never considered it in the light of business, Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't let it turn you from business, Andy. You said the timber was\r\nworth about two hundred a year to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"About that; it'll be more--or less--before I'm six months older. It's\r\nsink or swim, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've no call to sink,\" said Jack Rock with emphasis. \"Your father's\r\nson ain't goin' to sink while Jack Rock can throw a lifebelt to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, Jack. I'd ask you for half your last crust, and you'd soak it\r\nin milk for me as you used to--if you had to steal the milk! But--well,\r\nwhat's up?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm gettin' on in life, boy. I've enough to do with the horses. I do\r\nuncommon well with the horses. I've a mind to give myself to that. Not\r\nbut what I like the meat. Still I've a mind to give myself to the\r\nhorses. The meat's worth--Oh, I'll surprise you, Andy, and don't let it\r\ngo outside o' this room--the meat's worth nigh on five hundred a year!\r\nAye, nigh on that! The chilled meat don't touch me much, nor the London\r\nstores neither. Year in, year out, nigh on five hundred! Nancy loved\r\nyou; the old gentleman never said a word as showed he knew a difference\r\nbetween me and him. Though he must have known it. I'm all alone, Andy.\r\nWhile I can I'll keep the horses--Lord, I love the horses! You drop your\r\ntimber. Take over the meat, Andy. You're a learnin' chap; you'll soon\r\npick it up from me and Simpson. Take over the meat, Andy. It's a safe\r\nfive hundred a year!\"\r\n\r\nSo he pleaded to have his great benefaction accepted. He had meant to\r\ngive in a manner perhaps somewhat magnificent; what he gave was to him\r\ngreat. The news of tea and tennis at Nutley, of dinner at Halton,\r\ninduced a new note. Proud still, yet he pleaded. It was a fine\r\nbusiness--the meat! Nor chilled meat, nor stores mattered seriously; his\r\nconnection was so high-class. Five hundred a year! It was luxury,\r\nposition, importance; it was all these in Meriton. His eyes waited\r\nanxiously for Andy's answer.\r\n\r\nAndy caught his hand across the table. \"Dear old Jack, how splendid of\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, lad?\"\r\n\r\nFor the life of him Andy could say nothing more adequate, nothing less\r\ndisappointing, less ungrateful, than \"I'd like to think it over. And\r\nthanks, Jack!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII.\r\n\r\nENTERING FOR THE RACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAndy Hayes had never supposed that he would be the victim of a problem,\r\nor exposed to the necessity of a momentous choice. Life had hitherto\r\nbeen very simple to him--doing his work, taking his pay, spending the\r\nmoney frugally and to the best advantage, sparing a small percentage for\r\nthe Savings Bank, and reconciling with this programme the keen enjoyment\r\nof such leisure hours as fell to his lot. A reasonable, wholesome,\r\nmanageable scheme of life! Or, rather, not a scheme at all--Andy was no\r\nschemer. That was the way life came--the way an average man saw it and\r\naccepted it. From first to last he never lost the conception of himself\r\nas an average man, having his capabilities, yet strictly conditioned by\r\nthe limits of the practicable; free in his soul, by no means perfectly\r\nfree in his activities. Andy never thought in terms of \"environment\" or\r\nsuch big words, but he always had a strong sense of what a fellow like\r\nhimself could expect; the two phrases may, perhaps, come to much the\r\nsame thing.\r\n\r\nIn South Africa he had achieved his sergeant's stripes--not a\r\ncommission, nor the Victoria Cross, nor anything brilliant. In Canada he\r\nhad not become a millionaire, nor even a prosperous man or a dashing\r\nspeculator; he had been thought a capable young fellow, who would,\r\nperhaps, be equal to developing the English side of the business. Andy\r\nmight be justified in holding himself no fool: he had no ground for\r\nhigher claims, no warrant for anything like ambition.\r\n\r\nThus unaccustomed to problems, he had expected to toss uneasily (he had\r\nread of many heroes who \"tossed uneasily\") on his bed all night through.\r\nLawn-tennis and a good dinner saved him from that romantic but\r\nuncomfortable ordeal; he slept profoundly till eight-thirty. Just before\r\nhe was called--probably between his landlady's knock and her remark that\r\nit was eight-fifteen (she was late herself)--he had a brief vivid dream\r\nof selling a very red joint of beef to a very pallid Vivien Wellgood--a\r\nfantastic freak of the imagination which could have nothing to do with\r\nthe grave matter in hand.\r\n\r\nYet, on the top of this, as he lay abed awhile in the leisure of Sunday\r\nmorning, with no train to catch, he remembered his father's B.A. Oxon;\r\nhe recalled his mother's unvarying designation of old Jack as \"the\r\nbutcher;\" he recollected Nancy's pride in marrying \"out of her\r\nclass\"--it had been her own phrase, sometimes in boast, sometimes in\r\napology. Though Nancy had a dowry of a hundred pounds a year--charged on\r\nthe business, and now returned to Jack Rock since Nancy left no\r\nchildren--she never forgot that she had married out of her class. And\r\ninto his father's? And into his own? \"I'm a snob!\" groaned Andy.\r\n\r\nHe grew a little drowsy again, and in his drowsiness again played tennis\r\nat Nutley, again dined at Halton, again saw Vivien in the butcher's\r\nshop, and again was told by Mr. Belfield not to undervalue himself. But\r\nis to take nigh on five hundred pounds a year to undervalue\r\nyourself--you who are making a precarious two? And where lies the\r\ndifference between selling wood and selling meat--wood from Canada and\r\nmeat in Meriton? Andy's broad conception of the world told him that\r\nthere was none; his narrow observation of the same sphere convinced him\r\nthat the difference was, in its practical bearings, considerable. Nay,\r\nconfine yourself to meat alone: was there no difference between\r\nimporting cargoes of that questionable \"chilled\" article and disposing\r\nof joints of unquestionable \"home-bred\" over the counter? All the\r\nargument was for the home-bred. But to sell the home-bred joints one\r\nwore a blue apron and carried a knife and a steel--or, at all events,\r\nsmacked of doing these things; whereas the wholesale cargoes of\r\n\"chilled\" involved no such implements or associations. Once again,\r\nCanada was Canada, New Zealand New Zealand, Meriton Meriton. With these\r\nconsiderations mingled two pictures--dinner at Halton, and Jack Rock's\r\nconvivial party.\r\n\r\n\"I'll get up,\" said Andy, too sore beset by his problem to lie abed any\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nChurch! The bells rang almost as soon as Andy--he had dawdled and\r\nlounged over dressing and breakfast in Sunday's beneficent leisure--was\r\nequipped for the day. In Meriton everybody went to Church, except an\r\ninsignificant, tolerated, almost derided minority who frequented a very\r\nsmall, very ugly Methodist chapel in a by-street--for towns like Meriton\r\nare among the best preserves of the Establishment. Andy always went to\r\nchurch on a Sunday morning, answering the roll-call, attending parade,\r\naccepting the fruits of his fathers' wisdom, as his custom was. \"Church,\r\nand a slice of that cold beef, and then a jolly long walk!\" he said to\r\nhimself. He had a notion that this typical English Sunday--the relative\r\nvalue of whose constituents he did not, and we need not, exactly\r\nassess--might help him to settle his problem. The cold beef and the long\r\nwalk made part of the day's character--the \"Church\" completed it. This\r\nwas Andy's feeling; it is not, of course, put forward as what he ought\r\nto have felt.\r\n\r\nSo Andy went to church--in a cut-away coat and a tall hat, though it\r\ndrizzled, and he would sooner have been in a felt hat, impervious to the\r\nrain. He sat just half-way down the nave, and it must be confessed that\r\nhis attention wandered. He had such a very important thing to settle in\r\nthis world; it would not go out of his mind, though he strove to address\r\nhimself to the issues which the service suggested. He laboured under the\r\ndisadvantage of not being conscious of flagrant iniquity, though he duly\r\nconfessed himself a miserable offender. He looked round on the\r\nneighbours he knew so well; they were all confessing that they were\r\nmiserable offenders. Andy believed it--it was in the book--but he\r\nconsidered most of them to be good and honest people, and he was almost\r\nglad to see that they did not look hopelessly distressed over their\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe First Lesson caught and chained his wandering attention. It was\r\nabout David and Jonathan; it contained the beautiful lament of friend\r\nfor friend, the dirge of a brotherly love. The Rector's voice was rather\r\nsing-song, but it would have needed a worse delivery to spoil the words:\r\n\"How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou\r\nwast slain in thine high places! I am distressed for thee, my brother\r\nJonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me; thy love for me was\r\nwonderful, passing the love of women. How are the mighty fallen and the\r\nweapons of war perished!\" Thus ended the song, so rich in splendour, so\r\ncharged with sorrow.\r\n\r\n\"Clinking!\" was Andy's inward comment. Then in a flash came the thought,\r\n\"Why, of course, I must ask Harry Belfield; he'll tell me what to do all\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\nThe reference of his problem to Harry ought to have disposed of it for\r\ngood, and left Andy free to perform his devotions with a single mind.\r\nBut it only set him wondering what Harry would decide, wondering hard\r\nand--there was no escaping from it--jealously. His service in the ranks,\r\nhis residence in communities at least professedly democratic, had not\r\nmade him a thorough democrat, it seemed. He might have acquired the side\r\nof democracy the easier of the two to acquire; he might be ready to call\r\nany man his equal, whatever his station or his work. He stumbled at the\r\nharder task of seeing himself, whatever his work or station, as any\r\nman's equal--at claiming or assuming, not at according, equality. And in\r\nMeriton! To claim or assume equality with any and every man in Meriton\r\nwould, if he accepted Jack Rock's offer, be to court ridicule from\r\nequals and unequals all alike, and most of all from his admitted\r\ninferiors. Surely Harry would never send him to the butcher's shop? That\r\nwould mean that Harry thought of him (for all his kindness) as of Chinks\r\nor of the Bird. Could he risk discovering that, after all, Harry--and\r\nHarry's friends--thought of him like that? A sore pang struck him. Had\r\nhe been at Nutley--at Halton--only on sufferance? He had an idea that\r\nHarry would send him to the butcher's shop--would do the thing ever so\r\nkindly, ever so considerately, but all the same would do it. \"Well, it's\r\nthe safe thing, isn't it, old chap?\" he fancied Harry saying; and then\r\nreturning to his own high ambitions, and being thereafter very\r\nfriendly--whenever he chanced to pass the shop. Andy never deceived\r\nhimself as to the quality of Harry's friendship: it lay, at the most, in\r\nappreciative acceptance of unbounded affection. It was not like\r\nJonathan's for David. Andy was content. And must not acceptance, after\r\nall, breed some return? For whatever return came he was grateful. In\r\nthis sphere there was no room even for theories of equality, let alone\r\nfor its practice.\r\n\r\nFor some little time back Andy had been surprised to observe a certain\r\nattribute of his own--that of pretty often turning out right. He\r\naccounted for it by saying that an average man, judging of average men\r\nand things, would fairly often be right--on an average; men would do\r\nwhat he expected, things would go as he expected--on an average. Such\r\ndiscernment as was implied in this Andy felt as no endowment, no\r\nclairvoyance; rather it was that his limitations qualified him to\r\nappreciate other people's. He would have liked to feel able to except\r\nHarry Belfield who should have no limitations--only he felt terribly\r\nsure of what Harry Belfield would say: Safety, and the shop!\r\n\r\nBy this time the church service was ended, the cold beef eaten, most of\r\nthe long walk achieved. For while these things went straight on to an\r\nend, Andy's thoughts rolled round and round, like a squirrel in a cage.\r\n\r\n\"A man's only got one life,\" Andy was thinking to himself for the\r\nhundredth time as, having done his fifteen miles, he came opposite the\r\nentry to Nutley on his way home after his walk. What a lot of thoughts\r\nand memories there had been on that walk! Walking alone, a man is the\r\nvictim--or the beneficiary--of any number of stray recollections, ideas,\r\nor fancies. He had even thought of--and smiled over--sardonic Miss\r\nDutton's sardonic remark that he was worth ten of either Billy Foot\r\nor--Harry Belfield! Well, the poor girl had come one cropper; allowances\r\nmust be made.\r\n\r\nCool, serene, with what might appear to the eyes of less happy people an\r\nalmost insolently secure possession of fortune's favour, Harry Belfield\r\nstood at Nutley gate. Andy, hot and dusty, winced at being seen by him;\r\nHarry was so remote from any disarray. Andy's heart leapt at the sight\r\nof his friend--and seemed to stand still in the presence of his judge.\r\nBecause the thing--the problem--must come out directly. There was no\r\nmore possibility of shirking it.\r\n\r\nVivien was flitting--her touch of the ground seemed so light--down the\r\ndrive, past the deep dark water, to join Harry for a stroll. His\r\ninvitation to a stroll on that fine still Sunday afternoon had not been\r\ngiven without significance nor received without a thousand tremblings.\r\nSo it would appear that it was Andy's ill-fortune to interrupt.\r\n\r\nHarry was smoking. He took his cigar out of his mouth to greet Andy.\r\n\r\n\"Treadmill again, old boy? Getting the fat off?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're the one man I wanted to see.\" Then Andy's face fell; it was an\r\nawful moment. \"I want to ask your advice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look sharp!\" said Harry, smiling. \"I've an appointment. She'll be here\r\nany minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jack Rock's offered to turn the shop over to me, as soon as I learn the\r\nbusiness. I say, I--I suppose I ought to accept? He says it's worth hard\r\non five hundred a year. I say, keep that dark; he told me not to tell\r\nanybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gad, is it?\" said Harry, and whistled softly.\r\n\r\nVivien came in sight of him, and walked more slowly, dallying with\r\nanticipation.\r\n\r\n\"Splendid of him, isn't it? I say, I suppose I ought to--to think it\r\nover?\" He had been doing nothing else for what seemed eternity.\r\n\r\nHarry laughed--that merry irresponsible laugh of his. \"Blue suits your\r\ncomplexion, Andy. It seems damned funny--but five hundred a year! Worth\r\nthat, is it now, really? And he'd probably leave you anything else he\r\nhas.\"\r\n\r\nSilently-flitting Vivien was just behind Harry now. Andy saw her, Harry\r\nwas unaware of her presence. She laid her finger on her lips, making a\r\nconfidant of Andy, in her joy at a trick on her lover.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it--well, it sort of defines matters--ties you down, eh?\"\r\nHarry's laugh broke out again. \"Andy, old boy, you'll look infernally\r\nfunny, pricing joints to old Dove or Miss Pink! Oh, I say, I don't think\r\nyou can do it, Andy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you, Harry?\" Andy's tone was eager, beseeching, full of hope.\r\n\r\n\"But I suppose you ought.\" Harry tried to be grave, and chuckled again.\r\n\"You'd look it uncommon well, you know. You'd soon develop the figure.\r\nOld Jack never has--doesn't look as if his own steaks did him any good.\r\nBut you--we'd send you to Smithfield in no time!\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you two talking about?\" asked Vivien suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there you are at last! Why, the funniest thing! Old Andy here wants\r\nto be a butcher.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want--\" Andy began.\r\n\r\n\"A butcher! What nonsense you do talk sometimes, Harry!\" She stood by\r\nHarry's side, so happy in him, so friendly to Andy.\r\n\r\n\"Fact!\" said Harry, and acquainted her with the situation.\r\n\r\nVivien blushed red. \"I--I'm very sorry I said what--what I did to you.\r\nYou remember?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I remember,\" said Andy.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I--I never knew--I never thought--Of course, somebody\r\nmust--Oh, do forgive me, Mr. Hayes!\"\r\n\r\nHarry raised his brows in humorous astonishment. \"All this is a secret\r\nto me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I told Mr. Hayes I didn't like--well--places where they sold\r\nmeat--raw meat, Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think really, Harry?\" Andy asked.\r\n\r\nHarry shrugged his shoulders. \"Your choice, old man,\" he said. \"You've\r\nlooked at all sides of it, of course. It's getting latish, Vivien.\"\r\n\r\nAndy would almost rather have had the verdict which he feared. \"Your\r\nchoice, old man\"--and a shrug of the shoulders. Yet his loyalty\r\nintervened to tell him that Harry was right. It was his choice, and must\r\nbe. He found Vivien's eyes on him--those distant, considering eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you couldn't give me an opinion, Miss Wellgood?\" he asked,\r\nmustering a smile with some difficulty.\r\n\r\nVivien's lips drooped; her eyes grew rather sad and distinctly remote.\r\nShe gave no judgment; she merely uttered a regret--a regret in which\r\nsocial and personal prejudice (it could not be acquitted of that)\r\nstruggled with kindliness for Andy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I thought you were going to be a friend of ours,\" she murmured\r\nsadly. She gave Andy a mournful little nod of farewell--of final\r\nfarewell, as it seemed to his agitated mind--and walked off with Harry,\r\nwho was still looking decidedly amused.\r\n\r\nThat our great crises can have an amusing side even in the eyes of those\r\nwho wish us well is one of life's painful discoveries. Andy had expected\r\nto be told that he must accept Jack Rock's offer, but he had not thought\r\nthat Harry would chaff him about it. He tried, in justice to Harry and\r\nin anxiety not to feel sore with his hero, to see the humorous side for\r\nhimself. He admitted that he could not. A butcher was no more ridiculous\r\nthan any other tradesman. Well, the comic papers were rather fond of\r\nputting in butchers, for some inscrutable reason. Perhaps Harry happened\r\nto think of some funny picture. Could that idea give Andy a rag of\r\ncomfort to wrap about his wound? The comfort was of indifferent quality;\r\nthe dressing made the wound smart.\r\n\r\nHe was alone in the road again, gay Harry and dainty Vivien gone,\r\nthinking little of him by now, no doubt. Yes, the choice must be his\r\nown. On one side lay safety for him and joy for old Jack; on the other a\r\nsore blow to Jack, and for himself the risk of looking a sad fool if he\r\ncame to grief in London. So far the choice appeared easy.\r\n\r\nBut that statement of the case left out everything that really tugged at\r\nAndy's heart. For the first time in his existence he was, vaguely and\r\ndimly, trying to conceive and to consider his life as a whole, and\r\nasking what he meant to do with it. Acutest self-reproach assailed him;\r\nhe accused himself inwardly of many faults and follies--of ingratitude,\r\nof snobbishness, of a ridiculous self-conceit. Wasn't it enough for a\r\nchap like him to earn a good living honestly? Oughtn't he to be thankful\r\nfor the chance? What did he expect anyhow? He was very scornful with\r\nhimself, fiercely reproving all the new stirrings in him, yet at the\r\nsame time trying to see what they came to; trying to make out what they,\r\nin their turn, asked, what they meant, what would content them. He could\r\nnot satisfy himself what the stirrings meant nor whence they came. When\r\nhe asked what would content them he could get only a negative answer;\r\nkeeping the shop in Meriton would not. In regard neither to what it\r\nentailed nor to what it abandoned could the stirrings find contentment\r\nin that.\r\n\r\nHe had been walking along slowly and moodily. Suddenly he quickened his\r\npace; his steps became purposeful. He was going to Jack Rock's. Jack\r\nwould be just having his tea, or smoking the pipe that always followed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nJack sat in his armchair. Tea was finished, and his pipe already alight.\r\nWhen he saw Andy's face he chuckled.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that's how I like to see you look, lad!\" he exclaimed joyfully.\r\n\"Not as you did when you went away last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, how do I look?\" asked Andy, amazed at this greeting.\r\n\r\n\"As if you'd just picked up a thousand pound; and so you have, and\r\nbetter than that.\"\r\n\r\nAll unknown to himself, Andy's face had answered to his feelings--to the\r\nsense of escape from bondage, of liberty restored, of possibilities once\r\nmore within his reach. The renewed lightness of his heart had made his\r\nface happy and triumphant. But it fell with a vengeance now.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" asked Jack, to whom the change of expression was bewildering.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry--I've never been so sorry in my life--but I--I can't do it,\r\nJack.\"\r\n\r\nJack sat smoking silently for a while. \"That was what you were lookin'\r\nso happy about, was it?\" he asked at last, with a wry smile. \"I've never\r\nafore seen a man so happy over chuckin' away five hundred a year. Where\r\ndoes the fun come in, Andy?\"\r\n\r\n\"O lord, Jack, I can't--I can't tell you about it. I--\"\r\n\r\n\"But if it does do you all that good, I suppose you've got to do it.\"\r\n\r\nAndy came up to him, holding out his hand. Jack took it and gave it a\r\nsqueeze.\r\n\r\n\"I reckon I know more about it than you think. I've been goin' over\r\nthings since last night--and goin' back to old things too--about the old\r\ngentleman and Nancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems so awfully--Lord, it seems everything that's bad and rotten,\r\nJack.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it don't,\" said old Jack quietly. \"It's a bit of a facer for me--I\r\ntell you that straight--but it don't seem unnatural in you. Only I'm\r\nsorry like.\"\r\n\r\n\"If there was anything in the world I could do, Jack! But there it\r\nis--there isn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not so sure about that.\" He was smoking very slowly, and seemed to\r\nbe thinking hard. Andy lit a cigarette. His joy was quenched in sympathy\r\nwith Jack.\r\n\r\n\"You've given me a disappointment, Andy. I'm not denyin' it. But there,\r\nI can't expect you to feel about the business as I do. Comin' to me from\r\nmy father, and havin' been the work o' the best years of my life! And no\r\nbetter business in any town of the size o' Meriton all the country\r\nthrough--I'll wager that! No, you can't feel as I do. And you've a right\r\nto choose your own life. There's one thing you might do for me, Andy,\r\nthough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if there's anything else in the world--\"\r\n\r\n\"I loved Nancy better than anybody, and the old gentleman--well, as I've\r\ntold you, he never let me see a difference. I've got no kin--unless I\r\ncan call you kin, Andy. If you want to make up for givin' me this bit\r\nof--of a facer, as I say, I'll tell you what you can do. There's times\r\nin a young chap's life when bein' able to put up a bit o' the ready\r\nmakes all the difference, eh? If so be as you should find yourself\r\nplaced like that, I want you to promise to ask me for it. Will you,\r\nlad?\" Jack's voice faltered for a moment. \"No call for you to go back\r\nacross half the world for it. It's here, waitin' for you in Martin's\r\nbank in High Street. If you ever want to enter for an event, let me put\r\nup the stakes for you, Andy. Promise me that, and we'll say no more\r\nabout the shop.\"\r\n\r\nAndy was touched to the heart. \"I promise. There's my hand on it, Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll come to me first--you won't go to any one before me?\" old Jack\r\ninsisted jealously.\r\n\r\n\"I'll come to you first--and last,\" said Andy.\r\n\r\n\"Aye, lad.\" The old fellow's eyes gleamed again. \"Then it'll be our\r\nrace. We'll both be in it, won't we, Andy? And if you pass the post\r\nfirst, I shall have a right to throw up my hat. And why shouldn't you?\r\nThe favourite don't always win.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not expecting to do anything remarkable, Jack. I'm not such a fool\r\nas that.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're no fool, or you'd never have been put to the trouble of refusin'\r\nmy shop,\" observed Jack with emphasis. \"And in the end I'm not sure but\r\nwhat you're right. I've never tried to rise above where I was born; but\r\nI don't know as there's any call for you to step down. I don't know as I\r\ndid my duty by the old gentleman in temptin' you. I'm not sure he'd have\r\nliked it, though he'd have said nothing; he'd never have let me see--not\r\nhim!\" He sighed and smiled over his reverential memories of the old\r\ngentleman, yet his eyes twinkled rather maliciously as he said to Andy,\r\n\"Dinin' at Halton again to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" laughed Andy, \"I'm not. I'm coming to supper with you if you'll\r\nhave me. What have you got?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cold boiled aitch-bone, and apple-pie, and a Cheshire in good\r\ncondition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's prime! But I must go and change first. I've walked fifteen\r\nor sixteen miles, and I must get into a clean shirt.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't dress for supper--not o' Sundays,\" Jack informed him gravely.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, get out, Jack!\" called Andy from the door.\r\n\r\n\"Supper at nine precise, carriages at eleven,\" Jack called after him,\r\npursuing his joke to the end with keen relish.\r\n\r\nAndy walked back to his lodgings, in the old phrase \"happy as a king,\"\r\nand infinitely the happier because old Jack had taken it so well, had\r\nunderstood, and, though disappointed, had not been hurt or wounded.\r\nThere was no breach in their affection or in their mutual confidence.\r\nAnd now, he felt, he had to justify himself in Jack's eyes, to justify\r\nhis refusal of a safe five hundred pounds a year. The refusal became, as\r\nhe thought over it, a spur to effort, to action. \"I must put my back\r\ninto it,\" said Andy to himself, and made up his mind to most strenuous\r\nexertions to develop that rather shy and coy timber business of his in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nYet, after he had changed, as he sat listening to the church bells\r\nringing for evening service, a softer strain of meditation mingled with\r\nthese stern resolves. Memories of his \"Saturday-off\" glided across his\r\nmind, echoes of this evening's encounter with Harry and Vivien sounded\r\nin his ears. There was, as old Jack Rock himself had ended by\r\nsuggesting, no call for him to step down. He could take the place for\r\nwhich he was naturally fit. He need not renounce that side of life of\r\nwhich he had been allowed a glimpse so attractive and so full of\r\ninterest. The shop in Meriton would have opened the door to one very\r\ncomfortable little apartment. How many doors would it not have shut? All\r\ndoors were open now.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were going to be a friend of ours.\" Andy, sitting in the\r\ntwilight, listening to the bells, smiled at the echo of those regretful\r\nwords. He cherished their kindliness, and smiled at their prejudice. The\r\nshop and Vivien were always connected in his mind since the first day he\r\nhad met her. Her words came back to him now, summing up all that he\r\nwould have lost by acceptance, hinting pregnantly at all that his\r\nrefusal might save or bring.\r\n\r\nHe stretched his arms and yawned; mind and body both enjoyed a happy\r\nrelaxation after effort.\r\n\r\n\"What a week-end it's been!\" he thought. Indeed it had--a week-end that\r\nwas the beginning of many things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII.\r\n\r\nWONDERFUL WORDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFully aware of his son's disposition and partly acquainted with his\r\nexperiences, Mr. Belfield had urged Harry to \"go slow\" in his courting\r\nof Vivien Wellgood. An opinion that marriage was Harry's best chance was\r\nnot inconsistent with advising that any particular marriage should be\r\napproached with caution and due consideration, that a solid basis of\r\naffection should be raised, calculated to stand even though the winds of\r\ntime carried away the lighter and more fairy-like erections of Harry's\r\nromantic fancy. To do Harry justice, he did his best to obey the\r\npaternal counsel; but ideas of speed in such matters, and of cautious\r\nconsideration, differ. What to Harry was sage delay would have seemed to\r\nmany others lighthearted impetuosity. He waited a full fortnight after\r\nhe was absolutely sure of--well, of the wonderful thing he was so sure\r\nof--a fortnight after he was absolutely sure that Vivien was absolutely\r\nsure also. (The fortnights ran concurrently.) Then he began to feel\r\nrather foolish. What on earth was he waiting for? A man could not be\r\nmore than absolutely sure. Yet perhaps, in pure deference to his father,\r\nhe would have waited a week longer, and so achieved, or sunk to, an\r\nalmost cold-blooded deliberation. (He had known Mrs. Freere only a week\r\nbefore he declared--and abjured--a passion!) He was probably right; it\r\nwas no good waiting. No greater security could be achieved by that.\r\nWhether the pursuit were deliberate or impetuous, an end must come to\r\nit. It was afterwards--when the chase was over and the quarry won--that\r\nthe danger came for Harry and men like him. Sage delay and a solid basis\r\nof affection could not obviate that peril; the born hunter would still\r\nlisten to the horn that sounded a new chase. Somewhere in the world--so\r\nthe theory ran--there must live the woman who could deafen Harry's ears\r\nto a fresh blast of the horn. On that theory monogamy depends for its\r\npersonal--as distinguished from its social--justification. So Mr.\r\nBelfield reasoned, with a smile, and counselled delay. But there were no\r\nmeans of ransacking the world, and even the theory itself was doubtful.\r\nHarry was an eager advocate of the theory, but thought that there was no\r\nneed to search beyond little Meriton for the woman. At any rate, if\r\nMeriton did not hold her, she did not exist--the theory stood condemned.\r\nStill he would wait one week more--to please his father.\r\n\r\nA thing happened, a word was spoken, the like of which he had never\r\nanticipated. To defend himself laughingly against comparisons with the\r\nproverbial Lothario, to protest with burlesque earnestness against\r\ncharges of susceptibility, fickleness, and extreme boldness of\r\nassault--Harry played that part well, and was well-accustomed to play\r\nit. But to suffer a challenge, to endure a taunt, to be subjected to a\r\nsneer, as a slow-coach, a faint-heart, a boy afraid to tell a girl he\r\nloved her, afraid to snatch what he desired! This was a new experience\r\nfor Harry Belfield, new and unbearable. And when he had only been trying\r\nto please his father! Hang this pleasing of one's father, if it leads to\r\nthings like that!\r\n\r\nHe dashed up to Nutley one fine afternoon on his bicycle; he was\r\nteaching Vivien the exercise, and she was finding that even peril had\r\nits charms. But he was late for his appointment. Isobel Vintry sat alone\r\non the terrace by the water.\r\n\r\n\"How are you, Miss Vintry? I say, I'm afraid I'm late. Where's Vivien?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're nearly half an hour late.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I know. I couldn't help it. Where is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"She got tired of waiting for you, and went for a walk in the wood.\"\r\n\r\n\"She might have waited.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes. One would think she'd be accustomed to it by now,\" said\r\nIsobel. Her tone was lazily indolent, but her eyes were set on him in\r\nmockery.\r\n\r\nHarry looked at her with a sudden alertness. He looked at her hard.\r\n\"Accustomed to waiting for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" She was exasperating in her malicious tranquillity, meaning more\r\nthan she said, saying nothing that he could lay hold of, quite grave,\r\nand laughing at him.\r\n\r\n\"Any hidden meanings, Miss Vintry?\" For, as a fact, Harry had generally\r\nbeen punctual, and knew it.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but what's quite obvious,\" she retorted, dexterously fencing.\r\n\r\n\"Or ought to be, to a man not so slow as I am?\"\r\n\r\n\"You slow, Mr. Harry! You're Meriton's ideal of reckless dash!\"\r\n\r\n\"Meriton's?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the name of the town, isn't it? Or did you think I said\r\nLondon's?\"\r\n\r\nHarry laughed, but he was stung; she put him on his mettle. \"Oh no, I\r\nunderstood your emphasis.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't keep her waiting any longer--while you talk about nothing\r\nto me. You'll find her in the west wood--if you want to. She left you\r\nthat message.\"\r\n\r\nHarry had no doubt of what she meant, yet she had not spoken a word of\r\nit. The saying goes that words are given us to conceal our thoughts; has\r\nanybody ever ventured to say that lips and eyes are? Her meaning carried\r\nwithout speech; understanding it, Harry took fire.\r\n\r\n\"I won't be late again, Miss Vintry,\" he said. \"It would be a pity to\r\ndisappoint Meriton in its ideal!\"\r\n\r\nHe would have liked to speak to her for a moment sincerely, to ask her\r\nif she really thought--But no, it could not be risked. She would make\r\nhim feel and look ridiculous. Asking her opinion about the right moment\r\nto--to--to come up to the scratch (he could find no more dignified\r\nphrase)! Her eyes would never let him hear the end of that.\r\n\r\n\"Still lingering?\" she said, stifling a yawn. \"While poor Vivien waits!\"\r\n\r\nThere are unregenerate atavistic impulses; Harry would dearly have liked\r\nto box her ears. \"Meriton's ideal\" rankled horribly. What business was\r\nit of hers? It could not concern her in the least--a conclusion which\r\nmade matters worse, since disinterested criticism is much the more\r\nformidable.\r\n\r\n\"I can find her in a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, if you look! Shall you be back to tea?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we'll be back to tea, Miss Vintry. Both of us--together!\"\r\n\r\nIsobel smiled lazily again. \"Come, you are going to make an effort.\r\nNothing of the laggard now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's the word you've been thinking suits me?\"\r\n\r\n\"It really will if you don't get to the west wood soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll get there--and be back--in half an hour.\"\r\n\r\nThe one thing he could not endure was that any woman--above all, an\r\nattractive woman--should find in him, Harry Belfield, anything that was\r\nridiculous. She might chide, she might admire; laugh she must not, or\r\nher laugh should straightway be confounded. Isobel's hint that he had\r\nbeen a laggard in love banished, in a moment, the uncongenial prudence\r\nwhich he had been enforcing on himself.\r\n\r\nShe watched him with a contemptuous smile as he strode off on his quest.\r\nWhy had she mocked, why had she hinted? In part for pure mockery's sake.\r\nShe found a malicious pleasure in giving his complacency a dig, in\r\nshaking up his settled good opinion of himself. In part from sheer\r\nimpatience of the simple obvious love affair, to which she was called by\r\nher situation to play witness, chaperon, and practically accomplice. It\r\nwas quite clear how it was going to end--better have the end at once!\r\nHer smile of contempt had been not so much for Harry as for the business\r\non which he was engaged; yet Harry had his share of it, since her veiled\r\nbanter had such power to move him. But that same thing in him had its\r\nfascination; there was a great temptation to exercise her power when the\r\nman succumbed to it so easily. In this case she had used it only to send\r\nhim a little faster whither he was going already; but did that touch the\r\nlimits of it?\r\n\r\nSo she speculated within herself, yet not quite candidly. Her feeling\r\nfor Harry was far from being all contempt. She mocked him with her\r\n\"Meriton ideal,\" but she was not independent of the Meriton standard\r\nherself. To her as to the rest of his neighbours he was a bright star;\r\nto her as to them his looks, his charm, his accomplishments appealed. In\r\nher more than in most of them his emotions, so ready and quick to take\r\nfire, found a counterpart. To her more than to most of them indifference\r\nfrom him seemed in some sort a slight, a slur, a mark of failure.\r\nUnconsciously she had fallen into the Meriton way of thinking that\r\nnotice from Harry Belfield was a distinction, his favour a thing marking\r\noff the recipient from less happy mortals. She had received little\r\nnotice and little favour--a crumb or two of flirtation, flung from\r\nVivien's rich table!\r\n\r\nTo Vivien, after all the person most intimately concerned, Harry had\r\nseemed no laggard; she would have liked him none the worse if he had\r\nshown more of that quality. Nothing that he did could be wrong, but some\r\nthings could be--and were--alarming. Her fastidiousness was not hurt,\r\nbut her timidity was aroused. She feared crises, important moments, the\r\ncrossing of Rubicons, even when the prospect looked fair and delightful\r\non the other side of the stream.\r\n\r\nTo-day, in the west wood, the crossing had to be made. It by no means\r\nfollows that the man who falls in love lightly makes love lightly; he is\r\nas much possessed by the feeling he has come by so easily as though it\r\nwere the one passion of a lifetime. In his short walk from Isobel\r\nVintry's side to Vivien's, Harry's feelings had found full time to rise\r\nto boiling-point. Isobel was far out of his mind; already it seemed to\r\nhim inconceivable that he should not, all along, have meant to make his\r\nproposal--to declare his love--to-day. How could he have thought to hold\r\nit in for an hour longer?\r\n\r\n\"I know I was late, Vivien,\" he said. \"I'm so sorry. But--well, I half\r\nbelieve I was on purpose.\" He was hardly saying what was untrue; he was\r\ncoming to half-believe it--or very nearly.\r\n\r\n\"On purpose! O Harry! Didn't you want to give me my lesson to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in bicycling,\" he answered, his eyes set ardently on her face.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting on the trunk of a fallen tree, which had been stripped\r\nof its bark and shaped into a primitive bench. He sat down by her and\r\ntook her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Your hand shakes! What's the matter? You're not afraid of me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not of you--no, not of you, Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of something then? Is it of something I might do--or say?\" He raised\r\nher hand to his lips and kissed it.\r\n\r\nIt was no use trying to get answers out of her; she was past that; but\r\nshe did not turn away from him, she let her eyes meet his in a silent\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\n\"Vivien, I love you more than all my life!\"\r\n\r\n\"You--you can't,\" he could just hear her murmur, her lips scarcely\r\nparted.\r\n\r\n\"More than everything in the world besides!\"\r\n\r\nWhat wonderful words they were. \"More than everything in the world\r\nbesides!\" \"More than all my life!\" Could there be such words? Could she\r\nhave heard--and Harry uttered them? Her hands trembled violently in his;\r\nshe was sore afraid amidst bewildering joy. Anything she had\r\nforeshadowed in her dreams seemed now so faint, so poor, against\r\nmarvellous reality. Surely the echo of the wonderful words would be in\r\nher ears for all her life!\r\n\r\nShe had none wherewith to answer them; her hands were his already; for\r\nthe tears in her eyes she could hardly see his face, but she turned her\r\nlips up to his in mute consent.\r\n\r\n\"That makes you mine,\" said Harry, \"and me yours--yours only--for ever.\"\r\n\r\nShe released her hands from his, and put her arm under his arm. Still\r\nshe said nothing, but now she smiled beneath her dim eyes, and pressed\r\nhis arm.\r\n\r\n\"Not frightened now?\" he asked softly. \"You need never be frightened\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke at last just to say \"No\" very softly, yet with a wealth of\r\nconfident happiness.\r\n\r\n\"The things we'll do, the things we'll see, the times we'll have!\" cried\r\nHarry gaily. \"And to think that it's only a month or two ago that the\r\nidea occurred to me!\" He teased her. \"Occurred to us, Vivien?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, Harry. Well, then, yes.\" She laughed lightly, pressing his arm\r\nagain. \"But never that it could be like this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this--nice?\" he asked in banter.\r\n\r\n\"Is it--real?\" she whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's real and it's nice--real nice, in fact,\"\r\nlaughed Harry.\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk just for a little while,\" she begged, and he humoured her,\r\nwatching her delicate face during the silence she entreated. \"You must\r\ntell them,\" she said suddenly, with a return of her alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I'll do all the hard work,\" he promised her, smiling.\r\n\r\nShe fell into silence again, the wonderful words re-echoing in her\r\nears--\"More than everything in the world besides!\" \"More than all my\r\nlife!\"\r\n\r\n\"I promised Miss Vintry we'd be back to tea. Do you think you can face\r\nher?\" asked Harry.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, with you. But you've got to tell. You promised.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll have somebody to help you over all the stiles--now and\r\nhereafter.\"\r\n\r\nThe suggestion brought a radiant smile of happiness to her lips; it\r\nexpressed to her the transformation of her life. So many things had been\r\nstiles to her, and her father's gospel was that people must get over\r\ntheir own stiles for themselves; that was the lesson he inculcated, with\r\nIsobel Vintry to help him. But now--well, if stiles were still possible\r\nthings at all, with Harry to help her over they lost all their terrors.\r\n\r\n\"We'll remember this old tree-trunk. In fact I think that the proper\r\nthing is to carve our initials on it--two hearts and our initials.\r\nThat's real keeping company!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" she protested with a merry little laugh. \"Keeping company!\r\nHarry!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll let you off the hearts, but I must have the initials--very,\r\nvery small. Do let me have the initials!\"\r\n\r\n\"Somewhere where nobody will look, nobody be likely to see them!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes; I'll find a very secret place! And once a year--on the\r\nanniversary, if we're here--we'll come and freshen them up with a\r\npenknife.\"\r\n\r\nHe had his out now, and set about his pleasant silly task, choosing one\r\nend of the tree-trunk, near to the ground, where, in fact, nobody who\r\nwas not in the secret would find the record.\r\n\r\n\"There you are--a beautiful monogram; 'H' and 'V' intertwined. I'm proud\r\nof that!\"\r\n\r\n\"So am I--very proud, Harry!\" she said softly, taking his arm as they\r\nmoved away. Was she not blessed among the daughters of women? To say\r\nnothing of being the envy of all Meriton!\r\n\r\nAnd for Harry the past was all over, the dead had buried its dead. The\r\nnew life--and the life of the new man--had begun.\r\n\r\nWellgood was back from a ride round his farms--a weekly observance with\r\nhim. He had been grimly encouraging the good husbandmen, badly scaring\r\nthe inefficient, advising them all to keep their labourers in order, and\r\ntheir womankind as near to reason as could be hoped for. Now he had his\r\nhour of relaxation over tea. He was a great tea-drinker--four or five\r\ncups made his allowance. Tea is often the libertinism of people\r\notherwise severe. He leant back in his garden-chair, his gaitered legs\r\noutstretched, and drank his tea, Isobel Vintry replenishing the\r\nswiftly-emptied cup. She performed the office absent-mindedly--with an\r\nair of detachment which hinted that she would fulfil her duties, routine\r\nthough they might be, but must not be expected to think about them.\r\n\r\n\"Where's Vivien?\" he asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"In the west wood--with Mr. Harry. He said they'd be back for tea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" He finished his third cup and handed the vessel over to her to be\r\nrefilled. \"Things getting on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think so. Here's your tea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you think so? Give me another lump of sugar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sugar at that rate'll make you put on too much weight. Well, I gave him\r\na hint that the pear was ripe.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did? Well, I'm hanged!\"\r\n\r\n\"You think I'm very impudent?\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you say? But I daresay you said nothing. You've a trick with\r\nthose eyes of yours, Isobel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've devoted them solely to supervising your daughter's education, Mr.\r\nWellgood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes!\" he chuckled. He liked impudence from a woman; to primitive\r\nman--Wellgood had a good leaven of the primitive--it is an agreeable\r\nprovocation.\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet you,\" she said--with her challenging indolence that seemed to\r\nsay \"Disturb me if you can!\"--\"I'll bet you we hear of the engagement in\r\nten minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know a lot about it! What'll you bet me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything you like--from a quarter's salary downwards!\" said Isobel. She\r\nsat facing the path from the west wood. On it she saw two figures, arm\r\nin arm. Wellgood had his back turned that way. The situation was\r\nfavourable for Isobel's bet.\r\n\r\nA light hand in flirtation could not be expected from a man to whom the\r\nheavy hand--the strong decisive grip--was gospel in matters public and\r\nprivate. Besides, he had grown impatient; his affair waited on Harry's.\r\n\r\n\"From a quarter's salary downwards? Will you bet me a kiss?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she smiled, \"if losing means the kiss. Because I know I shall\r\nwin, Mr. Wellgood.\"\r\n\r\nHarry and Vivien came near, still exalted in dreams, the new man and the\r\ngirl transformed. Wellgood had not noticed them, perhaps would have\r\nforgotten them anyhow.\r\n\r\n\"If winning meant the kiss?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I don't bet as high as that, except on a certainty,\"\r\nsmiled Isobel. \"Another cup?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I tell you, Isobel--\" He leant over the table towards her.\r\n\r\n\"Don't tell me, and don't touch me! They're just behind you, Mr.\r\nWellgood.\"\r\n\r\nHe swore under his breath. A plaguy mean trick this of women's--defying\r\njust when they are safe! He had to play the father--and the\r\nfather-in-law to be; to seem calm, wise, benevolent, paternally\r\naffectionate, patronizing to young love from the sage eminence of years\r\nthat he was just, a second ago, forgetting.\r\n\r\nSince she had come into his house, to be Vivien's companion and\r\nexemplar, a year ago, they had had many of these rough defiant\r\nflirtations. He was not easily snubbed, she not readily frightened. They\r\nhad worked together over Vivien's rather severe training in a\r\nmatter-of-fact way; but there had been this diversion for hours of\r\nleisure. Why not? Flirtation of this order was not the conventional\r\nthing between the girl's father and the girl's companion. No matter!\r\nThey were both vigorously self-confident people; the flirtation suited\r\nthe taste of at least one of them, and served the ends of both.\r\n\r\nThe near approach of the lovers--the imminence of a declared\r\nengagement--made a change. Wellgood advanced more openly; Isobel\r\nchallenged and repelled more impudently. The moment for which he had\r\nwaited seemed near at hand; she suffered under an instinctive impulse to\r\nprove that she too had her woman's power and could use it. But, deep\r\ndown in her mind, the proof was more for Harry's enlightenment than for\r\nWellgood's subjugation. She had an overwhelming desire not to appear, in\r\nHarry's conquering eyes, a negligible neglected woman. She mocked the\r\nMeriton standard--but shared it.\r\n\r\n\"Look round!\"\r\n\r\nHe obeyed her.\r\n\r\n\"Arm in arm!\"\r\n\r\nHe started, and glowered at the approaching couple. Vivien hastily\r\ndropped Harry's arm.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's nothing--she's just afraid! It's settled all the same. And\r\nwithin my ten minutes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, you're a--!\" He smiled in grim fierce admiration.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I take three months' notice, Mr. Wellgood?\" She was lying back in\r\nher chair again, insolent and serenely defiant. \"I might have betted\r\nafter all, and been quite safe,\" she said.\r\n\r\nHarry victorious in conquest, Vivien with her more precious conquest in\r\nsurrender, were at Wellgood's elbow. He had to wrench himself away from\r\nhis own devices.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what have you got to say, Vivien?\" he asked his daughter rather\r\nsharply. She was looking more than usually timid. What was there to be\r\nfrightened at?\r\n\r\n\"She hasn't got anything to say,\" Harry interposed gaily. \"I'm going to\r\ndo the talking. Are you feeling romantic to-day, Mr. Wellgood?\"\r\n\r\nWellgood smiled sourly. \"You know better than to try that on me, Master\r\nHarry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! Well, I'll cut that, but I just want to mention--as a matter of\r\nbusiness, which may affect your arrangements--that Vivien has promised\r\nto marry me.\"\r\n\r\nVivien had stolen up to her father and now laid her hand lightly on his\r\nshoulder. He looked at her with a kindly sneer, then patted her hand.\r\n\"You like the fellow, do you, Vivien?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I daresay we can fix matters up. Shake hands, Harry.\"\r\n\r\nVivien kissed his forehead; the two men shook hands.\r\n\r\n\"I daresay you're not exactly taken by surprise,\" said Harry, laughing.\r\n\"I've been calling rather often!\"\r\n\r\n\"It had struck me that something was up.\"\r\n\r\nWellgood was almost genial; he was really highly pleased. The match was\r\nan excellent one for his daughter; he liked Harry, despite a lurking\r\nsuspicion that he was \"soft;\" and the way now lay open for his own plan.\r\n\r\n\"You haven't asked me for my congratulations, Vivien,\" said Isobel.\r\n\r\nVivien went over to her and kissed her, then sat down by the table, her\r\neyes fixed on Harry. She was very quiet in her happiness; she felt so\r\npeaceful, so secure. Such was the efficacy of those wonderful words!\r\n\r\n\"And I wish you all happiness too, Mr. Harry,\" Isobel went on with a\r\nsmile. \"Perhaps you'll forgive me if I say that I'm not altogether taken\r\nby surprise either?\"\r\n\r\nHarry did not quite like her smile; there seemed to be a touch of\r\nridicule about it. It covertly reminded him of their talk before tea,\r\nbefore he went to the west wood.\r\n\r\n\"I never had much hope of blinding your eyes, so I didn't even try, Miss\r\nVintry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking it must come to a head soon,\" she remarked.\r\n\r\nHarry flushed ever so slightly. She was hinting at the laggard in love\r\nagain; it almost seemed as if she were hinting that she had brought the\r\naffair to a head. In the west wood he had forgotten her subtle taunt; he\r\nhad thought of nothing but his passion, and how impatient it was. Now he\r\nremembered, and knew that he was being derided, even in his hour of\r\ntriumph. He felt another impulse of anger against her. This time it took\r\nthe form of a desire to show her that he was no fool, not a man a woman\r\ncould play with as she chose. He would like to show her what a dangerous\r\ngame that was. He was glad when, having shot her tiny sharp-pointed\r\ndart, she rose and went into the house. \"You'll want to talk it all over\r\nwith Mr. Wellgood!\" He did not want to think of her; only of Vivien.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Isobel!\" said Vivien. \"She's very nice about it, isn't she?\r\nBecause she can't really be pleased.\"\r\n\r\nBoth men looked rather surprised; each was roused from his train of\r\nthought. Both had been thinking about Isobel, but the thoughts of\r\nneither consorted well with Vivien's \"Poor Isobel!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Harry.\r\n\r\n\"It means the loss of her situation, Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course! I never thought of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you young people be in too great a hurry,\" said Wellgood, with\r\nthe satisfied smile of a man with a secret. \"You're not going to be\r\nmarried the day after to-morrow! There's lots of time for something to\r\nturn up for Isobel. She needn't be pitied. Perhaps she may be tired of\r\nyou and your ways, young woman, and glad to be rid of her job!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucky there's somebody ready to take her place, then, isn't it?\"\r\nlaughed Harry.\r\n\r\nWellgood laughed too as he rose. \"It seems very lucky all round,\" he\r\nsaid, smiling again as he left them. He was quite secure that they would\r\nspend no time in thinking about good luck other than their own.\r\n\r\nThe lovers sat on beside the water till twilight fell, talking of a\r\nthousand things, yet always of one thing--of one thing through which\r\nthey saw all the thousand other things, and saw them transfigured with\r\nthe radiance of the one. Even the bright hues of Harry's future grew a\r\nhundredfold brighter when beheld through this enchanted medium, while\r\nVivien's simple ideal of life seemed heaven realized. Visions were their\r\nonly facts, and dreams alone their truth. Neither from without nor from\r\nwithin could aught harm the airy fabric that they built--Vivien out of\r\nignorance, Harry by help of that fine oblivion of his.\r\n\r\nFor a long while Isobel Vintry--fled to her room lest Wellgood should\r\nseek her--watched them from her window with envious eyes. For them the\r\ndreams; for her, most uninspiring reality! At last she turned away with\r\na weary impatient shrug.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's a good thing to have it over and done with, anyhow!\" she\r\nexclaimed, and smiled once more to think how she had stung Harry\r\nBelfield with her insinuations and her \"Meriton ideal.\" If we cannot be\r\nhappy ourselves, it is a temptation to make happy people a little\r\nuncomfortable. In that lies an evidence of power consolatory to the\r\notherwise unfortunate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX.\r\n\r\n\"INTERJECTION.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSettling the question of the butcher's shop had seemed to Andy Hayes\r\nlike a final solution of life's problems. Therein he showed the quality\r\nof his mind. One thing at a time, settle that. As he had learnt to say\r\n'on the other side,' \"Don't look for trouble!\" He had yet to realize\r\nwhat the man of imagination knows instinctively--that the problems of\r\nlife end only with life itself.\r\n\r\nAn eight-ten train to town is not, however, favourable to such a large\r\nand leisurely survey as a consideration of life in its totality. It\r\ninvolved a half-hour's race for the station. And this morning the\r\nBird--standing at the door of his father's hostelry--delayed a\r\nhard-pressed man who had absolutely no time to stop.\r\n\r\n\"Heard the news about Mr. Harry?\" cried the Bird across the street.\r\n\r\nAndy slowed down. \"About Harry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Engaged to Miss Wellgood!\" shouted the Bird.\r\n\r\n\"No, is he?\" yelled Andy in reply. \"Hurrah!\"\r\n\r\nIt was but two days after the great event had happened. Recently Andy\r\nhad seen nothing of his Meriton friends. He had been working early and\r\nlate in town; down at seven-thirty, up to work again at eight-ten. He\r\nhad been a very draught-horse, straining at a load which would not\r\nmove--straining at it on a slippery slope. Business was so \"quiet.\"\r\nCould not work command success? At present he had to be content with the\r\nmeagre consolation proffered to Sempronius. He must be at the office not\r\na second later than nine. If the American letters came in, replies could\r\nget off by the same day's mail.\r\n\r\nYet the news of the engagement--he wished he could have had it from\r\nHarry's own lips--cut clean across his personal preoccupations. How\r\nright! How splendid! Dear old Harry! And how he would like to\r\ncongratulate Miss Vivien! All that on Saturday afternoon or Sunday. Andy\r\nwas one of the world's toilers; for them works of charity, friendship,\r\nand love have for the most part to wait for Saturday afternoon or\r\nSunday; the other five days and a half--it's the struggle for life,\r\ngrimly individual.\r\n\r\nHe loved Harry Belfield, and stored up untold enthusiasm for Saturday\r\nafternoon or Sunday--those altruistic hours when we have time to\r\nconsider our own souls and other people's fortunes. But to-day was only\r\nThursday; Thursday is well in the zone of the struggle. Andy's timber\r\nbusiness was--just turning the corner! So many businesses always are.\r\nShops expensively installed, hotels over-built, newspapers--above all,\r\nnewspapers--started with a mighty flourish of heavy dividends combined\r\nwith national regeneration--they are all so often just turning the\r\ncorner. The phrase signifies that you hope you are going to lose next\r\nyear rather less than you lost last year. If somebody will go on\r\nsupplying the deficit--in that sanguine spirit which is the strength of\r\na commercial nation--or can succeed in inducing others to supply it in a\r\nsimilar spirit, the corner may in the end be turned. If not, you stay\r\nthis side of the magical corner of success, and presently find yourself\r\nin another--to be described as \"tight.\" A life-long experience of\r\nquestions--of problems and riddles--was not, for Andy Hayes, to stop\r\nshort at the felicitous solution of the puzzle about Jack Rock's\r\nbutcher's shop in Meriton High Street.\r\n\r\nAndy had to postpone reflection on Harry Belfield's happiness and\r\nVivien's emancipation. Yet he had a passing appreciation of the end of\r\nordeals--of Curly, cross-country rides, and the like. Would the mail\r\nfrom Montreal bring a remittance for the rent of the London office? The\r\nother business men in the fast morning train were grumpy. Money was\r\ntight, the bank rate stiff, times bad. No moment to launch out! There\r\nwere sounded all the familiar jeremiads of the City train. What could\r\nyou expect with a Liberal Government in office? The stars in their\r\ncourses fought against business. Nobody would trust anybody. It was not\r\nthat nobody had the money--nobody ever has--but hardly anybody was\r\nbelieved to be able, in the last resort, to get it. That impression\r\nspells collapse. The men in the first-class carriage--Andy had decided\r\nthat it was on the whole \"good business\" to stand himself a first-class\r\n\"season\"--seemed well-fed, affluent, possessed of good cigars; yet they\r\nwere profoundly depressed, anticipative of little less than imminent\r\nstarvation. One of them explicitly declared his envy of a platelayer\r\nwhom the train passed on the line.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-two bob a week certain,\" he said. \"Better than losing a couple\r\nof hundred pounds, Jack. Not much longer hours either, and an open-air\r\nlife!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, take it on,\" Jack, who had a cynical turn of humour, advised. \"He\r\n(the platelayer he meant) couldn't very well lose more than you do; and\r\nyou'll never make more than he does. Swap!\"\r\n\r\nThe first speaker retired behind the _Telegraph_ in some disgust. It is\r\nhard to meet a rival wit as early as eight-thirty in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe American mail was not in when Andy\r\nreached Dowgate Hill, in which important locality\r\nhe occupied an insignificant attic. A fog off the\r\ncoast of Ireland accounted for the delay. But\r\non his table, as indicated by the small boy who\r\nconstituted his staff--the staff would, of course,\r\nbe larger when that corner was turned--lay a\r\ncable. There was no other correspondence. Things\r\nwere quiet. Andy could not suppress a reflection\r\nthat a rather later train would have done as well.\r\nStill there was a cable; no doubt it advised\r\nthe remittance. The remittance was a matter of\r\nperemptory necessity, unless Andy were to empty\r\nhis private pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Incontestable--Incubation--Ineffective.\" So ran the cable.\r\n\r\nAndy scratched his nose and reached for the code.\r\n\r\nIf ever a digression were allowable, if expatiation on human fortune and\r\nvicissitudes were still the fashion, what a text lies in the cable code!\r\nThis cold-blooded provision for all emergencies, this business-like\r\nabbreviation of tragedy! \"Asbestos\" means \"Cannot remit.\" \"Despairing\"\r\nsignifies \"If you think it best.\" (Could despair sound more despairing?)\r\n\"Patriotic--Who are the heaviest creditors?\" Passing to other fields of\r\nlife: \"Risible--Doctor gives up hope.\" \"Refreshing--Sinking steadily;\r\nprepare for the worst.\" \"Resurrection--There is no hope of recovery.\"\r\n\"Resurgam--Realization of estate proceeding satisfactorily.\"\r\n\r\nThe cable code is a masterly epitome of life.\r\n\r\nHowever Andy Hayes was not given to digression or to expatiation.\r\nPatiently he turned the leaves to find the interpretation of his own\r\nthree mystic words.\r\n\r\nThe result was not encouraging.\r\n\r\n\"Incontestable--Incubation--Ineffective.\"\r\n\r\nWhich being interpreted ran: \"Most essential to retrench all unnecessary\r\nexpense. Cannot see prospects of your branch becoming paying\r\nproposition. Advise you to close up and return as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a fourth word. The \"operator\"--Andy still chose in his mind\r\nthe transatlantic term--had squeezed it into a corner, so that it did\r\nnot at first catch the reader's notice. \"Infusoria.\" Andy turned up\r\n\"Infusoria.\" It was a hideously uncompromising word, as the code\r\nrendered it; the code makes a wonderful effort sometimes. \"Infusoria\"\r\nmeant: \"We expect you to act on this advice at once, and we cannot be\r\nresponsible for expenditure beyond what is strictly necessary to wind\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\nAndy did not often smoke in his office in business hours, but he had a\r\ncigarette now.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's pretty straight,\" he thought. The instructions were\r\ncertainly free from ambiguity. \"Made a failure of it!\" The cigarette\r\ntended to resignation. \"Needed a cleverer fellow than I am to make it\r\ngo.\" This was his usual sobriety of judgment. \"Rather glad to be out of\r\nit.\" That was the draught-horse's instinctive cry of joy at being\r\nreleased from a hopeless effort. They were right on the other side--it\r\nwas not a \"paying proposition.\" He was good at seeing facts; they did\r\nnot offend him. So many people are offended at facts--really a useless\r\ntouchiness.\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" said Andy, flinging the end of the cigarette into the\r\ngrate, and taking up that fateful code again.\r\n\r\n\"Passionately\" met his need: \"Will act on instructions received without\r\ndelay and with all possible saving of expense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Andy, his stylograph moving in mid-air. He turned over the\r\npages again, seeking another word, thinking very hard whether he should\r\nsend that other word when he found it.\r\n\r\nThe word was \"Interjection.\" It meant: \"My personal movements uncertain.\r\nWill advise you of them at the earliest moment possible.\"\r\n\r\nTo cable \"Interjection\" would mean an admission of considerable import,\r\nboth to his principals in Montreal and to himself. It would imply that\r\nhe was thinking of cutting adrift. Andy was thinking terribly hard about\r\nit. It might cause his principals to consider that he was taking too\r\nmuch on himself. Andy was not a partner; he was only on a salary, with a\r\nsmall contingent profit from commissions. It seemed complimentary--and\r\ndelusive--now to call the profit contingent; the salary was all he had\r\nin the world. Such an independently minded word as \"Interjection\"\r\nincurred a risk. Before he had done thinking about cutting adrift, he\r\nmight find himself cut adrift. The principals were peremptory men. In\r\nview of his failure to make the London branch a \"paying proposition,\"\r\nperhaps he was lucky in that he had not been cut adrift already. There\r\nwas a code word for that--\"Seltzer.\" It meant, \"We shall be able to\r\ndispense with your services on the ---- prox.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seltzer thirtieth\" would have thrown--and might still throw--Andy on\r\nthe mercy of the world. Turning up the code (if you are not thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with it) may be interesting work--\"as exciting as any novel,\"\r\nas reviewers kindly say of books of travel.\r\n\r\nAndy had suddenly, and with some surprise, become aware how very much he\r\nwished not to go back to Montreal, pleasant city as it is. When he was\r\npuzzling about the Meriton shop, Canada had stood for freedom, scope,\r\nand opportunity. Why should it not stand for them still, just as well\r\nas, or better than, London? Canada and London had ranked together then,\r\nin sharp opposition to the narrow limits of his native town. Nobody\r\ncould deny the scope and the opportunities of Canada. But Andy did not\r\nwant to go back. He was profoundly apologetic to himself about the\r\nfeeling; he would not have ventured to justify it; it was wrong. But,\r\nafter his long exile, his native land had laid hold on him--England with\r\nher ripe rich sweetness, London baited with a thousand lures. He had no\r\npluck, no grit, no go; so he said to himself. There were fortunes to be\r\nmade over there--a mighty nation to help in building up. That was all\r\ntrue, but he did not want to go. The stylograph hung longingly over the\r\ncable form; it wanted to write \"Interjection.\"\r\n\r\nThe fog had apparently been very persistent in the Irish Channel, for no\r\nmail came; the principals in Montreal seemed quite right about the\r\nLondon branch, for no business offered. At half-past twelve Andy\r\ndetermined to go out for lunch and a walk. By the time he got back the\r\nmail might have come--and he might have made up his mind whether or not\r\nto cable \"Interjection.\"\r\n\r\nA man who has it in mind to risk his livelihood often decides that he\r\nmay as well treat himself liberally at lunch or dinner. Monte Carlo is a\r\nterribly expensive place to stay at if you do not gamble; if you do, it\r\ncosts nothing--at least, what it costs does not matter, which comes to\r\nthe same thing. Andy decided that, having two hours off, he would go\r\nwest for lunch. His thoughts were on the great restaurant by the river.\r\nIf he were really leaving London in a week (obedient to \"Infusoria\"), it\r\nwould be interesting to go there once again.\r\n\r\nEntering the grill-room, on his left as he came in from the Strand (at\r\nthe last moment the main restaurant had struck him as absurd for his\r\nchop), he was impressed by the air of habituality worn by his\r\nfellow-guests. What was humdrum to them was a treat to him, their\r\nroutine his adventure. They knew the waiters, knew the maitre d'hotel,\r\nand inquired after the cook. They knew one another too, marking who was\r\nthere to-day, who was an absentee. Andy ate his chop, with his mouth\r\nhealthily hungry, with his eyes voracious of what passed about him.\r\n\r\nHe sat near a glass screen some six or seven feet high, dividing the\r\nroom in two. Suddenly from the other side of it came a voice:\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, is that you, Hayes? Come and have your coffee with us. Where\r\nhave you been all this time?\"\r\n\r\nThere they sat--and there they might have been sitting ever since Andy\r\nparted from them, so much at home they looked--Billy Foot, the Nun, and\r\nMiss Dutton. Another young man was with them, completing the party. He\r\nwas plump, while Billy was thin--placid, while Billy always suggested a\r\nreserve of excitement; but he had a likeness to Billy all the same.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I say, may I come?\" cried Andy, boyishly loud; but the luck of\r\nmeeting these friends again was too extraordinary. He trotted round the\r\nglass screen with his tumbler in his hand; he had not quite finished his\r\nlager beer.\r\n\r\n\"Chair and coffee for Mr. Hayes,\" said Billy Foot. \"You remember him,\r\ngirls? My brother, Hayes--Gilly, Mr. Hayes. How did you leave Harry?\"\r\n\r\n\"How awfully funny I should meet you!\" gasped Andy.\r\n\r\n\"It's not funny if you ever come here,\" observed Miss Dutton; \"because\r\nwe come here nearly every day--with somebody.\" She was more sardonic\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\nThe Nun--she was not, by the way, a Nun any longer, but a Quaker girl\r\n(\"All in the same line,\" her manager said, with a fine indifference to\r\nthe smaller theological distinctions), and now sang of how, owing to her\r\nhaving to wear sombre garments (expressed by a charming dove-tinted\r\ncostume that sent the stalls mad), she had lost her first and only\r\nlove--the Nun smiled at Andy in a most friendly fashion.\r\n\r\n\"I'd quite forgotten you,\" she remarked, \"but I'm glad to see you again.\r\nLet's see, you're--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Harry Belfield's friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you're Mr. Hayes. Oh, I remember you quite well. Been away since?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I've been here. I mean--at work, and so on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well!\" sighed the Nun (Andy ventured to call her the Nun in his\r\nthoughts, though she had changed her persuasion). She seemed to express\r\na gentle resignation to not being able to keep track of people; she met\r\nso many, coming every day to the restaurant.\r\n\r\n\"I ask five, I want four, but with just the right fellow I'd take\r\nthree,\" said Billy's brother Gilly, apparently continuing a conversation\r\nwhich seemed to interest nobody but himself; for the Nun was looking at\r\nneighbouring hats, Miss Dutton had relapsed into gloomy abstraction, and\r\nBilly was thoughtfully revolving a small quantity of old brandy round a\r\nvery large glass. Gilly had an old brandy too, but his attitude towards\r\nit was one of studied neglect. His favourite vintage had given out the\r\nyear before, so his life was rather desolate.\r\n\r\n\"Harry's engaged,\" Andy volunteered to the Nun, glad to possess a remark\r\nof such commanding interest.\r\n\r\n\"To a girl?\" asked the Nun, absently and without turning her face\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, of course!\" said Andy. What else could one be engaged to?\r\n\r\n\"Everybody comes to it,\" said Billy Foot. \"Take three, if you must,\r\nGilly.\"\r\n\r\n\"At a push,\" said his brother sadly.\r\n\r\n\"I hate that hat on that woman,\" said the Nun with a sudden vehemence,\r\nnodding her head at a fat woman in a large purple erection. Hats moved\r\nthe Nun perhaps more than anything else in the world.\r\n\r\n\"Rot, Doris,\" commented Miss Dutton. \"It's what they're wearing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they aren't all as fat as that,\" the Nun objected.\r\n\r\n\"Flourishing, Hayes?\" asked Billy Foot.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I rather think I've just lost my job,\" said Andy.\r\n\r\n\"If you're looking out for a really sound way of investing five thousand\r\npounds--\" Gilly began.\r\n\r\n\"Four to a gentleman,\" said Billy.\r\n\r\n\"Three to a friend,\" corrected the Nun.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what the devil's the good of trying to talk business here?\" cried\r\nGilly in vexation. \"Only a chance is a chance, you know.\"\r\n\r\nBilly Foot saw that Andy was puzzled. \"Gilly--my brother, you know--I\r\nsuppose I introduced you?--has unfortunately come here with a problem on\r\nhis mind. I didn't know he had one, or I wouldn't have asked him,\r\nbecause problems bore the girls.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they don't. It interests me to see you trying to think.\" This, of\r\ncourse, from Miss Dutton. The Nun, now imbibing an iced green fluid\r\nthrough a straw, was sublimely abstracted.\r\n\r\n\"My brother,\" Billy resumed, with a glance of protest towards his\r\ninterruptor, \"has, for some reason or another, become a publisher.\r\nThat's all right. Not being an author, I don't complain. Having done\r\npretty badly--\"\r\n\r\n\"The public's no good,\" said Gilly gloomily.\r\n\r\n\"He wants to drag in some unfortunate person to be his partner. I\r\nunderstand, Gilly, that, if really well recommended, your accepted\r\npartner can lose his time, and the rest of his money, for no more than\r\nthree thousand pounds--paid down on the nail without discount?\"\r\n\r\n\"You've a charming way of recommending the project to Mr. Hayes'\r\nconsideration,\" said Gilly, in reproachful resignation.\r\n\r\n\"To my consideration,\" Andy exclaimed, laughing. \"What's it got to do\r\nwith me?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a real chance,\" Gilly persisted. \"And if you're out of a job, and\r\nhappen to be able to lay your hands on five--\"\r\n\r\n\"Three!\" whispered Billy.\r\n\r\n\"--thousand pounds, you might do worse than look into it. Now, I must\r\ngo,\" and with no more than a nod to serve as farewell to all the party\r\nhe rose and sauntered slowly away. He had not touched his brandy; his\r\nbrother reached over thoughtfully and appropriated it. \"I may as well,\r\nas I'm going to pay for it,\" he remarked.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Andy found himself telling the Nun all about his cable and his\r\naffairs. The other two listened; all three were very friendly and\r\nsympathetic; even Miss Dutton forbore to sneer. Andy expanded in the\r\nkindly atmosphere of interest. \"I don't want to go back, you know,\" he\r\nsaid with a smile that appealed for understanding. \"But I must, unless\r\nsomething turns up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, why not talk to Gilly?\" the Nun suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you go round and talk to Gilly,\" agreed Billy. \"Rotting apart,\r\nhe's got a nice little business, and one or two very good schemes on,\r\nbut he wants a bit more capital, as well as somebody to help him. He\r\ndoesn't look clever, but in five years he's built up--yes, a tidy little\r\nbusiness. You wouldn't come to grief with Gilly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I haven't got the money, or anything like it. I've got nothing.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun and Billy exchanged glances. The Nun nodded to Billy, but he\r\nshook his head. Miss Dutton watched them for a moment, then she smiled\r\nscornfully.\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind saying it,\" she observed, and to Andy's astonishment she\r\nasked him, \"What about your old friend the butcher?\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you hear of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Harry Belfield was up one day last week lunching here, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"We were awfully amused,\" the Nun interrupted, with her pretty rare\r\ngurgle. \"If you'd done it, we were all coming down to buy chops and give\r\nyou a splendid send-off. I rather wish you had.\" The imagined scene\r\namused the Nun very much.\r\n\r\n\"Jack Rock? Oh, I couldn't possibly ask him, after refusing his offer!\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you say his name was?\" the Nun inquired.\r\n\r\nAndy repeated the name, and the Nun nodded, smiling still. Andy became\r\nportentously thoughtful.\r\n\r\n\"We have sown a seed!\" said Billy Foot. \"I'll drop a word to Gilly to\r\nkeep the offer open. Now you must go, girls, because I've got some work\r\nto do in the world, though you never seem to believe it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heavens, I must go too!\" cried Andy, with a horrified look at his\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\n\"All right, you go,\" said Miss Dutton. \"We promised to meet a man here\r\nat half-past three and go motoring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did we? I don't believe we did,\" objected the Nun. \"I don't think I\r\nwant to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then don't,\" said Miss Dutton. \"I shall go anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll wait and see the car,\" the Nun conceded. She did not appear\r\nto have any curiosity about its owner. \"You really must come and see\r\nme--and don't go back to Canada!\" she called after Andy. Then, when she\r\nwas alone with her friend, she said, \"No, I shan't come motoring, Sally,\r\nI shall go home and write a letter. So much trouble is caused in this\r\nworld by people being afraid to do the obvious thing. Now I'm never\r\nafraid to do the obvious thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what you said the night you found me--and took me home with\r\nyou,\" said Miss Dutton. She spoke very low, and her voice was strangely\r\nsoft.\r\n\r\n\"It was the obvious thing to do, and I did it,\" the Nun pursued, shaking\r\nher head at Sally in mild rebuke of an uncalled-for touch of sentiment.\r\n\"I shall do the obvious thing now. I shall write to Mr. Jack Rock.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll get yourself into a row, meddling with other people's business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, I shan't,\" said the Nun serenely. \"I shall insist on a personal\r\ninterview before my action is condemned. I generally come out of\r\npersonal interviews all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arts and tricks!\" said Sally scornfully.\r\n\r\n\"Just an innocent and appealing manner,\" smiled the Nun. \"At any rate,\r\nthis very afternoon I write to Mr. Rock. He'll produce three thousand\r\npounds, Gilly will get a good partner, Andy Hayes can stay in England, I\r\nshall feel I've done a sensible thing. All that just by a letter!\" A\r\nthought struck her. \"I may as well write it here.\" She called a waiter\r\nand asked for notepaper and the A B C railway guide. \"Don't wait for me,\r\nSally. This letter will take some time to write.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not going to take it down yourself, are you?\" asked Sally, pointing to\r\nthe A B C.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no. Messenger boy. With any luck, it'll get there before Andy Hayes\r\ndoes. Rather fun if Jack Rock plays up to me properly!\"--and she allowed\r\nherself the second gurgle of the afternoon.\r\n\r\nSally stood looking at her with an apparently unwilling smile. She loved\r\nher better than anybody in the world, and would have died for her at\r\nthat or any other moment; but nothing of that sort was ever said between\r\nthem. They were almost unsentimental enough to please Mark Wellgood\r\nhimself. Only the Nun did like her little plans to be appreciated. Sally\r\ngave her all she wanted--a sharp little bark of a laugh in answer to the\r\ngurgle--before she walked away. The Nun settled to her task in demure\r\nserenity, seeming (yet not being) entirely unconscious of the extreme\r\nslowness with which most of the young men passed her table as they went\r\nout.\r\n\r\nBilly Foot had walked with Andy as far as the Temple and had reasoned\r\nwith him. Yet Billy himself admitted that there was great difficulty in\r\nthe case. Asked whether he himself would do what he advised, he was\r\nforced to admit that he would hesitate. Still he would not give up the\r\nidea; he would see Gilly about it; perhaps the payment could be\r\n\"spread.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would have to be spread very thin before I could pay it,\" smiled\r\nAndy ruefully. He gave Billy Foot's hand a hearty squeeze when they\r\nparted. \"It's so awfully good of you to be so interested--and of those\r\nnice girls too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, old chap, if we can help a pal!\" said Billy with a laugh.\r\n\"Besides, it's good business for Gilly too.\"\r\n\r\nAndy went back to Dowgate Hill and climbed up to his attic. The staff\r\nreported no callers in his absence; the baleful cable lay still in\r\npossession of the table. But Andy refused to be depressed. His lunch had\r\ndone him good. Steady and sober as his mind was, yet he was a little\r\ninfected by the gay confidence that had reigned among his company. They\r\nseemed all so sure that something would turn up, that what they wanted\r\nwould get itself done somehow. Spoilt children of fate, the brothers\r\nFoot and the Nun! Things they wanted had come easily to them; they\r\nexpected them to come easily to their friends. The Nun in particular\r\nappeared to treat fortune absolutely as a slave; she was not even\r\ngrateful; it was all too much a matter of course that things should\r\nhappen in the way she wanted. He did not appreciate yet the way in which\r\nthe Nun assisted the course of events sometimes.\r\n\r\nWell, his reply to the cable must go. He took up the form and read\r\n\"Passionately.\" It was significant of his changed mood--of what the\r\natmosphere of the lunch-party had done for him--that he hesitated hardly\r\nmore than one minute before he added the possibly fateful\r\n\"Interjection,\" and sent off the despatch before he had time again to\r\nwaver.\r\n\r\n\"If they choose to take offence--well, I can make a living somehow, I\r\nsuppose.\"\r\n\r\nAndy's confidence in himself was slowly but steadily ripening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X.\r\n\r\nFRIENDS IN NEED.\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Jack Rock was, in his own phrase, \"fair tickled to death\" at the\r\nwhole thing. The messenger boy reached him soon after five, just as he\r\nwas having his tea. It was not long before the boy was having tea\r\ntoo--such a tea as seldom came his way. Butter and jam together--why,\r\njam on cake, if he liked--and cream in his tea! Something in that letter\r\npleased the old gentleman uncommon, thought the boy, as he watched Jack\r\nchuckling over it, his forgotten bread-and-butter half-way between plate\r\nand mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Doris Flower! Well now, that's a pretty name,\" murmured Jack. \"And I'll\r\nlay she's a pretty girl!\" He asked the boy whether she was a pretty\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n\"'Er? Why, they're all mad about 'er,\" the boy told him. \"She's out o'\r\nsight, she is!\"\r\n\r\n\"Writes a pretty letter too,\" said Jack, and started to read it all\r\nafresh. It was, indeed, a persuasive letter:--\r\n\r\n  \"DEAR MR. ROCK,--I have heard so much that is nice about you from our\r\n  friends Harry Belfield and your nephew (isn't he?) Mr. Hayes, that I\r\n  feel quite sure you will not mind my writing to you. I know it is\r\n  rather an unusual thing to do, but I don't mind doing unusual things\r\n  when they're sensible, do you? Mr. Hayes was lunching with us to-day,\r\n  and he told us that something had gone wrong with his business, and\r\n  that he would have to go back to Canada. I'm sure you don't want him\r\n  to go back to Canada any more than we do. We like him so much, and you\r\n  must be very fond of him, aren't you? Well, by the most wonderful\r\n  chance, Billy Foot's brother (you know Billy, don't you? He has been\r\n  down to Meriton, I know) was at lunch too--Gilly Foot. Gilly has got a\r\n  most tremendously good business as a publisher, and he wants a\r\n  partner. Wasn't it lucky? Just as Mr. Hayes wants a new business,\r\n  Gilly Foot wants a partner! It might have been arranged on purpose,\r\n  mightn't it? And they took to one another directly. I'm sure Gilly\r\n  will be delighted to take Mr. Hayes (That does sound stiff--I think I\r\n  shall say 'Andy'), and Andy (!) would be delighted to join Gilly.\r\n  There's only one thing--Gilly must have a partner with some money, and\r\n  Andy says he hasn't got any. We knew about you and all you had wanted\r\n  to do for him, so of course we said he must ask you to give it to him\r\n  or lend it to him; but he said he couldn't possibly, as he had refused\r\n  your previous offer. But I'm sure you don't feel like that about it,\r\n  do you? I'm sure you would like to help him. And then we could keep\r\n  him here instead of his going back to Canada; we should all be so\r\n  pleased with that, and so would you, wouldn't you? Do please do it,\r\n  dear Mr. Rock!\r\n\r\n  \"I wonder if you know who I am. Perhaps you've seen my picture in the\r\n  papers? I'm generally done as a Nun. Have you? I wonder if you would\r\n  ever care to hear me sing? If you would, _do_ let me know when you can\r\n  come, and I will send you a box. And you won't forget to come round\r\n  and see me in my dressing-room afterwards, will you? It is so pleasant\r\n  to see one's friends afterwards; and I'll sing, oh, ever so much\r\n  better than usual for you!\r\n\r\n  \"I told the boy to wait--just in case you wanted to send an answer.\r\n  I'm very excited and anxious! It's three thousand pounds Gilly wants.\r\n  It seems to me an awful lot, but I don't know much about publishing.\r\n  Do forgive me, dear Mr. Rock, but I was sure you would like to know,\r\n  and I don't believe Andy would have told you himself. Mind, when you\r\n  come to town--don't forget!--I am, dear Mr. Rock, yours very\r\n  sincerely,\r\n\r\n                                                   \"DORIS FLOWER.\r\n\r\n  _P.S._--Some day soon, when I'm out motoring, I may stop and see\r\n  you--if you've been nice!\"\r\n\r\nJack Rock's heart was very soft; his vanity was also tickled. \"Excited\r\nand anxious, is she? Bless her! There'll be a rare talk in Meriton if\r\nshe comes to see old Jack!\" He chuckled. \"Me go and sit in a box, and\r\nhear her sing! Asked to her dressing-room too!\"\r\n\r\nThe novel picture of himself was altogether too much for Jack.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as you've done your tea, my lad, you can take an answer.\"\r\n\r\nJack's epistolary style was of a highly polite but rather unpractised\r\norder. He struggled between his punctilious recognition of his own\r\nstation and the temptation of the Nun's friendliness--also (perhaps by\r\nconsequence) between the third, second, and first grammatical persons:--\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. John Rock presents his respectful compliments to Miss Doris\r\n  Flower. Mr. Rock has the matter of which Miss Flower is good enough to\r\n  write under his careful consideration. Mr. Rock begs to assure you\r\n  that he will do his best to meet Miss Flower's wishes. There is\r\n  nothing I would not do for Andy, and I am sure that the boy will prove\r\n  himself deserving of Miss Flower's kind interest. When next visiting\r\n  London, Mr. Rock will feel himself highly honoured by availing himself\r\n  of Miss Flower's much-esteemed invitation. If Miss Flower should visit\r\n  Meriton, he would be very proud to welcome you at his house, next door\r\n  to the shop in High Street--anybody in Meriton knows where that is;\r\n  and I beg to remain, dear madam, your most obedient servant to\r\n  command,\r\n\r\n                                                    JOHN ROCK.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can take it,\" said Jack to the messenger boy. \"And here's half a\r\ncrown for yourself.\"\r\n\r\nThe messenger boy was a London boy; his professional belt was tight with\r\ntea; and half a crown for himself! He put on his cap and stood on the\r\nthreshold. Escape was easy; he indulged his native humour.\r\n\r\n\"From this\"--he exhibited the half-crown--\"and your looks, gov'nor,\" he\r\nsaid, \"I gather that she's accepted ye! My best wishes for yer\r\n'appiness!\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn the boy!\" said Jack, charging for the door in an explosion of\r\nlaughter. The boy was already half-way down the street. \"Hope my letter\r\nwas all right,\" Jack reflected, as he came back, baulked of his prey.\r\n\"May stop and see me, may she! Bless her heart!\"\r\n\r\nJack Rock felt that he had the chance of his life. He also felt that he\r\nwould like to obliterate what, in his humility, he now declared to have\r\nbeen a sad blunder--the offer of his butcher's shop. A man like Andy, a\r\nlad with friends like that--Mr. Harry Belfield, Mr. Foot, M.P., Mr. and\r\nMiss Wellgood, above all this dazzling Miss Doris Flower--to be the\r\nMeriton butcher! Perish the thought! Publishing was a gentleman's\r\nbusiness. Aye, and his Andy should not go back to Canada. If he did, old\r\nJack felt that the best part of his own life would be carried far away\r\nacross the seas.\r\n\r\nThe thing should be done dramatically. \"I'd like Andy to have a story to\r\ntell her!\" It was not at all doubtful whom he meant by \"her.\"\r\n\r\nNearly six--the bank was shut long ago. But George Croton was a friend\r\nas well as a bank manager; he would just have had tea. Jack crossed the\r\nstreet and dropped in.\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course I can, Jack,\" said Mr. Croton, wiping his bald head with\r\na red handkerchief. \"You've securities lodged with us that more than\r\ncover it. Draw your cheque. We won't wrong you over the interest till\r\nyou adjust the account. Going to buy a Derby winner?\"\r\n\r\n\"I ain't so sure I'm not goin' to enter one,\" said Jack. He wrote his\r\ncheque. \"That'll be all right to-morrow morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless our shutters are up, it will, Jack,\" Mr. Croton jestingly\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God I've been a careful man,\" thought old Jack. \"One that knows a\r\nhorse too! Her talkin' about 'Andy'!\" The Nun continued to amuse and\r\ndelight him immensely. Why, he'd seen her picture on the hoardings last\r\ntime he went up to Tattersall's, to sell that bay filly! Lord, not to\r\nhave thought of that! That was her--the Nun! He thought much more about\r\nMiss Flower than about Andy as he took his way to Andy's lodgings.\r\n\r\nAndy was at home; he had been back from town nearly an hour. But his own\r\nconcerns were quite out of his head. Harry Belfield had been waiting for\r\nhim--actually waiting, Harry the Great!--and had hailed him with \"I had\r\nto come and tell you all about it myself, old fellow!\"\r\n\r\nIn Andy's great devotion to Harry there was mingled an element which\r\nseemed to himself absurd, but which held its place obstinately--dim and\r\ndenied, yet always there. It was a sense of something compassionate,\r\nsomething protective, not diminishing his admiration but qualifying it;\r\nmaking him not only believe that all would, but also urgently pray that\r\nall might, go well with Harry, that Harry might have everything that he\r\nwished, possibly that Harry might wish the things that he ought to have,\r\nthough Andy's conscious analysis of the feeling did not reach as far as\r\nthis. He would not only set his hero on a pedestal, he would have the\r\npedestal securely fenced round, barricaded against danger, ensured\r\nagainst bombs; even a screen against strong and sudden winds might be\r\nuseful to the statue.\r\n\r\nThe statue, it now appeared, had taken all these precautions for itself.\r\nVivien Wellgood was each and all of these things--fence, screen, and\r\nbarricade. And many other things besides, such as an ideal, an\r\nincentive, an inspiration. It was among Harry's attractions that he was\r\nnot in the least ashamed of his emotions or shy about them.\r\n\r\n\"With the girls one meets in town it's a bargain,\" said Harry. \"With\r\nher--oh, I can talk to you, old man!--it really does seem a sort of\r\nsacrament.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. I mean I can imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not things a fellow can talk about to everybody,\" Harry pursued.\r\n\"Too--well, sacred, you know. But when for absolutely the first time in\r\nyour life you feel the real thing, you know the difference. The pater\r\ntold me not to be in a hurry about it; but a thing like that's just the\r\nsame now or a thousand years hence. It's there--and that's all about\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\nAndy felt a little out of his depth. He had had one fancy himself, but\r\nit had been nothing like so wonderful as this.  It was Harry's privilege\r\nto be able to feel things in that marvellous way. Andy was not equal\r\neven to commenting on them.\r\n\r\n\"When are you going to be married?\" he asked, sticking to a\r\nmatter-of-fact line of sympathy.\r\n\r\n\"Going to wait till October--rather a bore! But here it's nearly July,\r\nand I've got my tour of the Division fixed for September. After all,\r\nthings aren't so bad as they might be. And when I'm through with the\r\ncampaign--a honeymoon in Italy! Pretty good, Andy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds all right,\" laughed Andy. \"I expect I shall have to send you my\r\nblessing from Montreal.\"\r\n\r\n\"From Montreal? What--you're not going back?\"\r\n\r\n\"The business is a frost in London, Harry; and I've nothing else to look\r\nto.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord, now, what a pity! Well, I'm sorry. We shall miss you, Andy.\r\nStill, it's a ripping fine country, isn't it? Mind you cable us\r\ncongratulations!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not quite certain about going yet,\" said Andy. He felt rather like\r\nbeing seen off by the train--very kindly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, I hope you won't have to, old chap, I really do. But it'll be\r\nbetter than the shop! I say--I told Billy and the girls about that. They\r\nroared.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know they did--I met them at lunch to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had they heard about me?\" Harry asked rather eagerly. \"Or did you tell\r\nthem? What did they say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh--er--awfully pleased,\" said Andy, rather confused. It seemed strange\r\nto remember how very little had been said on the wonderful topic.\r\nSomehow they had wandered off to other things.\r\n\r\n\"I must give them all one more dinner,\" said Harry, smiling, \"before I\r\nsettle down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Foot's brother was there--Gilly Foot--and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Did they ask what she was like?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I don't quite remember--everybody was talking. Gilly Foot--\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect they were a bit surprised, weren't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, they seemed surprised.\" Andy was really trying to remember.\r\n\"Yes, they did.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I've got the character of a marrying man,\" smiled Harry.\r\n\"I hope you told them I meant business?\" Harry rose to his feet with a\r\nlaugh. \"They used to rot a lot, you know.\"\r\n\r\nHarry was not to be got off the engrossing subject of himself, his past,\r\nand his future; evidently he could not imagine that the lunch-party had\r\nkept off these subjects either. With a smile Andy made up his mind not\r\nto trouble him with the matter of Gilly Foot.\r\n\r\n\"I'll walk back with you as far as Halton gates,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"No, you won't, old chap,\" laughed Harry. \"Vivien's been in the town and\r\nis going to call for me here, and I'm going to walk with her as far as\r\nNutley gates--at least.\"\r\n\r\nVoices came from outside. \"Wish you good evenin', miss!\"--and a very\r\ntimid \"Good evening, Mr. Rock.\" Vivien and Jack! How was Vivien bearing\r\nthe encounter?\r\n\r\n\"There she is!\" cried Harry, and ran out of the house, Andy following.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Jack, how are you? Why, you're looking like a two-year-old!\"\r\n\r\nJack indeed looked radiant as he made bold to offer his congratulations.\r\nHe gave Harry his hand and a hearty squeeze, then looked at Vivien\r\ntentatively. She blushed, pulled herself together, and offered Jack her\r\nhand. The feat accomplished, she glanced quickly at Andy, blushing yet\r\nmore deeply. He knew what was in her mind, and nodded his head at her in\r\napplause. In Harry's cause she had touched a butcher.\r\n\r\n\"I like to see young folks happy. I like to see 'em get what they want,\r\nMr. Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see before you one at least who has, Jack. I wonder if I may say\r\ntwo, Vivien? And I wish I could say three, Andy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe you wouldn't be so far wrong, Mr. Harry,\" chuckled Jack. \"But\r\nthat's neither here nor there, and I mustn't be keepin' you and your\r\nyoung lady.\"\r\n\r\nWith blithe salutations the lovers went off. Andy watched them; they\r\nwere good to see. He felt himself their friend--Vivien's as well as\r\nHarry's, for Vivien trusted him with her shy confidences. They were hard\r\nto leave--even as were the delights of London with its lunch-parties and\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\n\"Going for a walk, Jack?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I want a talk with you, Andy.\" He led the way in, and sat down at\r\nthe table. \"I've been thinkin' a bit about you, Andy; so have some\r\nothers, I reckon. Mr. Belfield--he speaks high of you--and there's\r\nothers. There's no reason you shouldn't take your part with the best of\r\n'em. Why, they feel that--they make you one of themselves. So you shall\r\nbe. I can't make you a rich man, not as they reckon money, but I can\r\nhelp a bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"O Jack, you're always at it,\" Andy groaned affectionately.\r\n\r\nThe old fellow's eyes twinkled as he drew out a cheque and pushed it\r\nacross the table.\r\n\r\n\"Put that in your pocket, and go and talk to Mr. Foot's brother,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nAndy's start was almost a jump; old Jack's pent-up mirth broke out\r\nexplosively.\r\n\r\n\"But this--this is supernatural!\" cried Andy.\r\n\r\n\"Looks like it, don't it? How did I find out about that? Well, it shows,\r\nAndy, that it's no use you thinkin' of tryin' not to keep a certain\r\npromise you made to me--because I find you out!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear old Jack!\" Andy was standing by him now, his hand on his shoulder.\r\n\"I don't believe I could have kept the promise in this case. I think I\r\nshould have gone back--since the thing's no go in London.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you'd have gone back--just like your obstinate ways. But I found\r\nout. I've my correspondents.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there's been no time! Well, you are one too many for me, Jack!\"\r\n\r\nJack's pride in his cunning was even greater than his delight in his\r\nbenevolence. \"Perhaps I've had a wireless telegram?\" he suggested,\r\nwagging his head. \"Or a carrier pigeon? Who knows?\"\r\n\r\n\"But who was it told you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got some friends I didn't know of, up there in London. Havin'\r\nyour fling, are you, Andy? That's right. And very good taste you seem to\r\nhave too.\" He nodded approvingly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I give it up,\" said Andy. \"You're a wizard, Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you talk about a witch, you'll be a bit nearer the point, I reckon.\r\nNot meanin' me, I need hardly say! Well, I must let you into the\r\nsecret.\" With enormous pride he produced Miss Doris Flower's letter.\r\n\"Read that, my lad.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Nun!\" cried Andy, as his eye fell on the signature. \"Who'd have\r\nthought of that?\"\r\n\r\nHe read the letter; he listened to Jack's enraptured story of how it had\r\narrived. \"And you're not goin' to shame her by refusin' the money now,\r\nare you?\" asked cunning Jack. \"If you do, you'll make her feel she's\r\nbeen meddlin'. Nice thing to make her feel that!\"\r\n\r\nAndy saw through this little device, but he only patted Jack's shoulder\r\nagain, saying quietly, \"I'll take the money, Jack.\" All the kindness\r\nmade his heart very full--whether it came from old-time friends or these\r\nnew friends from a new world who made his cause theirs with so ready a\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\n\"You're launched now, lad--fair launched! And I know you'll float,\" said\r\nold Jack, grave at last, as he took his leave, his precious letter most\r\ncarefully stowed away in his breast-pocket. It had been a great day for\r\nJack, great for what he had done, great for the way in which his doing\r\nit had come about.\r\n\r\nWithin less than twenty-four hours Montreal had been written to, Gilly\r\nFoot had been written to--and Andy was at the Nun's door.\r\n\r\nShe dwelt with Miss Dutton in a big block of flats near Sloane Street,\r\nvery high up. Her sitting-room was small and cosy, presenting, however,\r\none marked peculiarity. On two of the walls the paper was red, on the\r\nother two green. Seeing Andy's eyes attracted by this phenomenon, the\r\nNun explained: \"We quarrelled over the colour to such an extent that at\r\nlast I lost my temper, and, when Sally was away for a day, had it done\r\nlike this--to spite her. Now she won't let me alter it, because it's a\r\nperpetual warning to me not to lose my temper. But it does look a little\r\nqueer, doesn't it?\"\r\n\r\nShe had received him with her usual composure. \"I knew you'd come,\r\nbecause I knew Mr. Jack Rock would do as I wanted, and I was sure he\r\ncouldn't keep the letter to himself. Well, that's all right! It was only\r\nthat the obvious thing wanted doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't see--well, I don't see why you should care.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, a lurking laugh in her eye.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you needn't suppose that it was life and death to me! It was rather\r\nfun, just on its own account. You'll like Gilly; he's a good sort,\r\nthough he's rather greedy. Did you notice that? Billy's really my\r\nfriend. I'm very fond of Billy. Are you ambitious? Billy's very\r\nambitious.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't think I am.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun lay back on a long chair; she was certainly wonderfully pretty\r\nas she smiled lazily at Andy.\r\n\r\n\"You look a size too large for the room,\" she remarked. \"Yes, Billy's\r\nambitious. He'd like to marry me, only he's ambitious. It doesn't make\r\nany difference to me, because I'm not in love with him; but I'm afraid\r\nit's an awfully uncomfortable state of affairs for poor Billy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if he'd have no chance anyhow, couldn't you sort of let him know\r\nthat?\" Andy suggested, much amused at an innocent malice which marked\r\nher description of Billy's conflict of feeling.\r\n\r\n\"No use at all. I've tried. But he's quite sure he could persuade me. In\r\nfact I don't think he believes I should refuse if it came to the point.\r\nSo there he is, always just pulling up on the brink! He can't like it,\r\nbut he goes on. Oh, but tell me all about Harry Belfield. Now I've got\r\nyou off my mind, I'm awfully interested about that.\"\r\n\r\nAndy was not very ready at description. She assisted him by a detailed\r\nand skilful cross-examination, directed to eliciting full information\r\nabout Vivien Wellgood's appearance, habits, and character--how old she\r\nwas, where she had been, what she had seen. When the picture of Vivien\r\nhad thus emerged--of Vivien's youth and secluded life, how she had been\r\nnowhere and seen nothing, how she was timid and shy, innocent and\r\ntrustful, above all, how she idolized Harry--the Nun considered it for a\r\nmoment in silence.\r\n\r\n\"Poor girl!\" she said at last. Andy looked sharply at her. She smiled.\r\n\"Oh yes, you worship Harry, don't you? Well, he's a very charming man. I\r\nwas rather inclined to fall in love with him once myself. Luckily for me\r\nI didn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure he'd have responded,\" Andy laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's just it; he would have! When did you say they were going to\r\nbe married?\"\r\n\r\n\"October, I think Harry said.\"\r\n\r\n\"Four months! And he dotes on her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think so. You should just hear him!\"\r\n\r\n\"I daresay I shall. He always likes talking to one girl about how much\r\nhe's in love with another.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun's matter-of-fact way of speaking may have contributed to the\r\neffect, but in the end the effect of what she said was to give the\r\nimpression that she regarded Harry Belfield's present passion as one of\r\na series--far from the first, not at all likely to be the last. The\r\ninflection of tone with which she had exclaimed \"Four months!\" implied\r\nthat it was a very long while to wait.\r\n\r\n\"You'd understand it better if you saw them together,\" said Andy, eager,\r\nas always, to champion his friend.\r\n\r\n\"You're very enthusiastic about her, anyhow,\" smiled the Nun. \"It almost\r\nsounds as if you were a little in love with her yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such a thing never occurred to me.\" Then he laughed, for the Nun was\r\nlaughing at him. \"Well, she would make every man want to--well, sort of\r\nwant to take care of her, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's no harm in your doing that--in moderation; and she may\r\ncome to want it. Have you ever been in love yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, once,\" he confessed; \"a long while ago, just before I left South\r\nAfrica.\"\r\n\r\n\"Got over it?\" she inquired anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course I have, long ago. It wasn't very fatal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fickle creature!\"\r\n\r\nAndy gave one of his bursts of hearty laughter to hear himself thus\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\"I like you,\" she said; \"and I'm glad you're going in with Gilly,\r\nbecause we shall often see you at lunch-time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but I can't afford to lunch at that place every day!\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to--with Gilly; because lunch is the only time he ever gets\r\nideas--he always says so--and unless he can tell somebody else he\r\nforgets them again, and they're lost beyond recall. He used to tell them\r\nto me, but I always forgot them too. Now he'll tell you; so you'll have\r\nto be at lunch, and put it down as office expenses.\"\r\n\r\nAndy had risen to go. The Nun sat up. \"I can only tell you once again\r\nhow grateful I am for all your kindness,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe gave him a whimsically humorous look. \"It's really time somebody\r\ntold you,\" she said; \"and as I feel rather responsible for you, after my\r\nletter to Mr. Jack Rock, I expect I'm the proper person to do it. If\r\nyou're not told, you may go about doing a lot of mischief without\r\nknowing anything about it. Prepare for a surprise. You're attractive!\r\nYes, you are. You're attractive to women, moreover. People don't do\r\nthings for you out of mere kindness, as they might be kind to a little\r\nboy in the street or to a lost dog. They do them because you're\r\nattractive, because it gives them pleasure to please you. That sort of\r\nthing will go on happening to you; very likely it'll help you a good\r\ndeal.\" She nodded at him wisely, then broke suddenly into her gurgle.\r\n\"Oh, dear me, you do look so much astonished, and if you only knew how\r\nred you've got!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I feel the redness all right; I know that's there,\" muttered Andy,\r\nwhose confusion was indeed lamentable. \"But when a--a person like you\r\nsays that sort of thing to me--\"\r\n\r\n\"A person, like me?\" She lifted her brows. \"What am I? I'm the fashion\r\nfor three or four seasons--that's what I am. Nobody knows where I come\r\nfrom; nobody knows where I'm going to; and nobody cares. I don't know\r\nmyself, and I'm not sure I care. My small opinion doesn't count for\r\nmuch. Only, in this case, it happens to be true.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you come from?\" asked Andy, in a sudden impulse of great\r\nfriendliness.\r\n\r\nShe looked him straight in the face. \"Nobody knows. Nobody must ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got no people belonging to me either. Even Jack Rock's no\r\nrelation--or only a 'step.'\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes grew a little clouded. \"You mustn't make me silly. Only we're\r\nfriends now, aren't we? We don't do what we can for one another out of\r\nkindness, but for love?\" She daintily blew him a kiss, and smiled again.\r\n\"And because we're both very attractive--aren't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'll accept the word if I'm promoted to share it with you. But I\r\ncan't say I've got over the surprise yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've stopped blushing, anyhow. That's something. Good-bye. I shall\r\nsee you at lunch, I expect, to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nAndy was very glad that she liked him, but he was glad of it because he\r\nliked her. His head was not turned by her assurance that he was\r\nattractive in a general sense: in the first place, because he remained\r\ndistinctly sceptical as to the correctness of her opinion, sincere as it\r\nobviously was; in the second, because the matter did not appear to be\r\none of much moment. No doubt folks sometimes did one a good turn for\r\nlove's sake, but, taking the world broadly, a man had to make his way\r\nwithout relying on such help as that. That sort of help had given him a\r\nfair start now. He was not going to expect any more of it. It seemed to\r\nhim that Jack Rock--or Jack and the Nun between them?--had already given\r\nhim more than his share. It was curious to associate her with Jack Rock\r\nin the work; a queer freak of chance that she had come into it! But she\r\nhad come into it--by chance and her own wilful fancy. Odd her share in\r\nit certainly was, but it was not unpleasant to him. He felt that he had\r\ngained a friend, as well as an opening in Gilly Foot's publishing house.\r\n\r\n\"But I wish,\" he found himself reflecting as he travelled back in the\r\nUnderground, \"that she understood Harry better.\"\r\n\r\nHere he fell into an error unusual with him; he overrated his own\r\njudgment, led thereto by old love and admiration. The Nun had clear\r\neyes; she had seen much of Harry Belfield, and no small amount of life.\r\nShe had had to dodge many dangers. She knew what she was talking about.\r\nIn all the side of things she knew so well, Andy, with his one\r\nattachment before he left South Africa long ago, was an innocent.\r\nPerhaps it was some dim consciousness of this, some half-realized\r\nfeeling that he was on strange ground where she was on familiar, which\r\nmade him find it difficult to get what she had said or hinted out of his\r\nhead. It was apt to come back to him when he saw Vivien Wellgood; an\r\nunlooked-for association in his mind of people who seemed far remote\r\nfrom one another. Thus the Nun had come into the old circle of his\r\nthoughts; henceforward she too belonged, in a way, to the world of\r\nMeriton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI.\r\n\r\nTHE SHAWL BY THE WINDOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nVivien and Isobel were alone at Nutley. It had been Wellgood's custom to\r\ngo every summer to Norway by himself, leaving his daughter at school, to\r\nthe care of her governess, or, for the last year or two, of her\r\ncompanion. He saw no reason against following his practice this year;\r\nindeed he was glad to go. The interval before the wedding dragged for\r\nhim, as perhaps it did for others. He had carried matters with Isobel as\r\nfar as he well could, unless he meant to carry them to the end--and it\r\nwas not his intention to do that just yet. A last bachelor excursion--he\r\ntold himself confidently that it was to be his last--had its attraction.\r\nEarly in July he packed his portmanteau and went, leaving instructions\r\nwith Isobel that her chaperonage was to be vigilant and strict. \"Err on\r\nthe safe side,\" he said. \"No harm in that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall bore them very much,\" Isobel suggested.\r\n\r\n\"That's what you're here for.\" He added, with his hard confident smile,\r\n\"Later on we'll try to give you a change from it.\"\r\n\r\nShe knew well what he meant, and was glad to see the last of him for a\r\nwhile; nay, in her heart would have been glad to see the last of him for\r\never. She clung to what his words and acts promised, from no affection\r\nfor him, but because it saved her from the common fate which her pride\r\ndespised--being dismissed, turned off, now that she was to become\r\nsuperfluous. She had been in effect Vivien's governess, her\r\nschoolmistress, invested with power and authority. She hated to step\r\ndown; it was open to her to step up. (A case not unlike Andy's.) Here\r\nwas the secret which maintained her pride. In the strength of it she\r\nstill ruled her charge with no lessening of prestige. It was no more in\r\nVivien's nature than in her position to wonder at that; her eyes were\r\nset on a near sure liberty. Temporary restraint, though it might be\r\nirksome, seemed no more than a natural passing incident. Harry noticed\r\nand was amused. He thought that Wellgood must have said a word to\r\nIsobel; hinted perhaps that Vivien was wax in her lover's hands, and\r\nthat her lover was impetuous. That Wellgood, or Isobel herself, or\r\nanybody else, should harbour that idea did not displease Harry Belfield;\r\nnot to be able to resist him would be a venial sin, even in Vivien.\r\n\r\nIt was an empty season in the little circle of Meriton society. Harry's\r\nfather and mother were away, gone to Switzerland. Andy came down for\r\nweek-ends generally; all the working days his nose was close to the\r\ngrindstone in the office of Messrs. Gilbert Foot and Co. He was learning\r\nthe business, delighting in his new activity. Harry would not have been\r\nin Meriton either, had he not been in love in Meriton. As it was, he had\r\nhis early ride, then read his books, then went over to Nutley for lunch,\r\nand spent all the rest of the day there. Often the curate would come in\r\nand make a four at tennis, but he did not stay to dinner. Almost every\r\nevening the three were alone, in the house or on the terrace by the\r\nwater. One night in the week Harry might be in town, one night perhaps\r\nhe would bring Andy. Four or five nights those three would be together;\r\nand the question for Isobel was how often, for how long, how completely\r\nshe was to leave the engaged couple to themselves. To put it more\r\nbrutally--how much of a bore was she to make herself?\r\n\r\nTo be a spy, a hindrance, a clog, to know that joy waited on the closing\r\nof the door behind her back, to listen to allusions half-intelligible,\r\nto turn a blind ear to words too tender, not to notice a furtive caress,\r\nto play the dragon of convention, the old-maid duenna--that was her\r\nfunction in Vivien's eyes. And the same in Harry's? Oh yes! the same in\r\nHarry Belfield's handsome, mischievous, deriding eyes! He laughed at her\r\nfor what she did--for what she did in the discharge of her duty, earning\r\nher bread-and-butter. Earning more than he thought, though! Because of\r\nthe derision in Harry's eyes, again she would not let Wellgood go.\r\nVivien should awake to realize that she was more than a chaperon,\r\ntiresome for the moment, soon to be dismissed; Harry should understand\r\nthat to one man she was no old-maid duenna, but the woman he wanted for\r\nwife. While she played chaperon at Nutley she wrote letters to\r\nWellgood--letters keeping his passion alive, playing with his\r\nconfidence, transparently feigning to ignore, hardly pretending to deny.\r\nThey were letters a lover successful in the end would laugh at. If in\r\nthe issue the man found himself jockeyed, they would furnish matter for\r\nfury as a great deceit.\r\n\r\nHarry Belfield was still looking forward to his marriage with ardour; it\r\nwould not be fair even to say that he was getting tired of his\r\nengagement. But he would have been wise to imitate Wellgood--take a last\r\nbachelor holiday, and so come back again hungry for Vivien's society.\r\nMuch as he liked the fare, he could not be said to hunger for it now, it\r\ncame to him so easily and so constantly. The absence of his parents, the\r\nemptiness of the town, his own want of anything particular to do,\r\nprevented even the small hindrances and interruptions that might have\r\nwhetted appetite by thwarting or delaying its satisfaction. Love-making\r\nbecame the business of his days, when it ought to have been the\r\ndiversion. Harry must always have a diversion--by preference one with\r\nsomething of audacity, venture, or breaking of bounds in it. His\r\nrelations with Vivien, legitimate though romantic, secure yet\r\ndelightful, did not satisfy this requirement. His career might have\r\nserved, and would serve in the future (so it was to be hoped), but the\r\ncareer was at a temporary halt till the autumn campaign began. He took\r\nthe diversion which lay nearest to hand; that also was his way. Isobel\r\nVintry possessed attractions; she had a temper too, as he knew very\r\nwell. He found his amusement in teasing, chaffing, and challenging her,\r\nin forcing her to play duenna more and more conspicuously, and in\r\nlaughing at her when she did it; in letting his handsome eyes rest on\r\nher in admiration for a second before he hastily turned them back to a\r\nrenewed contemplation of their proper shrine; in seeming half-vexed when\r\nshe left him alone with Vivien, not altogether sorry when she came back.\r\nHe was up to a dozen such tricks; they were his diversion; they\r\nflavoured the sweetness of his love-making with the spice of mischief.\r\n\r\nHe saw that Isobel felt, that she understood. Vivien noticed nothing,\r\nunderstood nothing. There was a secret set up between Isobel and\r\nhimself; Vivien was a stranger to it. Harry enlarged his interests! His\r\nrelations with Vivien were delightful, with Isobel they had a piquant\r\nflavour. Well, was not this a more agreeable state of things than that\r\nIsobel should be simply a bore to him, and he simply a bore to Isobel?\r\nThe fact of being an engaged man did not reconcile Harry Belfield to\r\nbeing simply a bore to a handsome woman.\r\n\r\nAmong Wellgood's orders there was one that Vivien should go to bed at\r\nten o'clock sharp, and Harry depart at the same hour. Wherever they\r\nwere, in house or garden, the lovers had to be found and parted--Vivien\r\nordered upstairs, Harry sent about his business. Isobel's duty was to\r\nenforce this rule. Harry found a handle in it; his malice laid hold of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Here comes the strict governess!\" he cried. Or, \"Here's nurse! Bedtime!\r\nWon't you really let us have ten minutes more? I believe you sit with\r\nyour watch in your hand.\"\r\n\r\nVivien rebuked him. \"It's not poor Isobel's fault, Harry. She's got to.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, she likes doing it. She's a born martinet! She positively loves to\r\nseparate us. You've no sympathy with the soft emotions, Miss Vintry.\r\nYou're just a born dragon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please come, Vivien,\" Isobel said, flushing a little. \"It's not my\r\nfault, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you never break rules, Miss Vintry? It's what they're made for, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've not been taught to think that in this house, have we, Vivien?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" said Vivien with marked emphasis.\r\n\r\nHarry laughed. \"A pattern child and a pattern governess! Well, we must\r\nkiss good-night. You and I, I mean, of course, Vivien. And I'm sent home\r\ntoo, as usual?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't want to stay here alone, do you?\" asked Isobel.\r\n\r\n\"Well, no, that wouldn't be very lively.\" His eyes rested on her a\r\nmoment, possibly--just possibly--hinting that, though Vivien left him,\r\nyet he need not be alone.\r\n\r\nOne evening, a very fine one--when it seemed more absurd than usual to\r\nbe ordered to bed or to be sent home so early--Harry chaffed Isobel in\r\nthis fashion, yet with a touch of real contempt. He did feel a genuine\r\ncontempt for people who kept rules just because they were rules. Vivien\r\nagain interceded. \"Isobel can't help it, Harry. It's father's orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely some discretion is left to the trusty guardian?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no pleasure to me to be a nuisance, I assure you,\" said Isobel\r\nrather hotly. \"Please come in, Vivien; it's well past ten o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nVivien rose directly.\r\n\r\n\"You've hurt Isobel, I think,\" she whispered to Harry. \"Say something\r\nkind to her. Good-night, dear Harry!\"\r\n\r\nShe ran off, ahead of Isobel, who was about to follow, with no word to\r\nHarry.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, wait a minute, please, Miss Vintry! I say, you know, I was only\r\njoking. Of course I know it's not your fault. I'm awfully sorry if I\r\nsounded rude. I thought you wouldn't mind a bit of chaff.\"\r\n\r\nShe stood looking at him with a hostile air.\r\n\r\n\"Why does it amuse you?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nThe square question puzzled Harry, but he was apt at an encounter. He\r\nfound a good answer. \"I suppose because what you do--what you have to\r\ndo--seems somehow so incongruous, coming from you. I won't do it again,\r\nif you don't like it. Please forgive me--and walk with me to the gate to\r\nprove it. There's no rule against that!\"\r\n\r\nFor half a minute she stood, still looking at him. The moonlight was\r\namply bright enough to let them see one another's faces.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" she said. \"Come along.\"\r\n\r\nHarry followed her with a pleasant feeling of curiosity. It was some\r\nlittle while before she spoke again. They had already reached the drive.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you say that it's incongruous, coming from me?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I can't answer that without being impertinent again,\"\r\nlaughed Harry.\r\n\r\nShe turned to him with a slight smile. \"Risk that!\"\r\n\r\nIt was many days since he had been alone with her--so devoted had he\r\nbeen to Vivien. Now again he felt her power; again he did not know\r\nwhether she put it forth consciously.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, you playing sheep-dog when you ought to be--\" He broke off,\r\nleaving his eyes to finish for him.\r\n\r\n\"So your teasing is to be considered as a compliment?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go on with it, if you'll take it like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does Vivien take it like that, do you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe she thinks anything about it--one way or the other.\r\nShe's partial to my small efforts to be amusing, that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if it's a compliment, I don't want any more of it. I think you'd\r\nbetter, under the circumstances, keep all your compliments for\r\nVivien--till you're married, at all events!\"\r\n\r\nHarry lifted his brows.\r\n\r\n\"Rules! Oh, those rules!\" he said with mock ruefulness.\r\n\r\n\"Is there any good in breaking them--for nothing?\"\r\n\r\nHe turned quickly towards her. She was smiling at him. \"For nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Here we are at the gate. Good-night, Mr. Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by--?\"\r\n\r\n\"I really can't stay any longer.\" She was doing the mockery now; his\r\neagerness had given her the advantage. \"You can think over my\r\nmeaning--if you like. Good-night!\"\r\n\r\nHarry said good-night. When he had gone fifty yards he looked back. She\r\nwas still there, holding the gate half open with her hand, looking along\r\nthe road. After him? As he went on, his thoughts were not all of Vivien.\r\nIsobel Vintry was a puzzling girl!\r\n\r\nThe next evening he brought Vivien into the drawing-room punctually at\r\nten.\r\n\r\n\"We're good children to-night!\" he said gaily. \"We've even said\r\ngood-night to one another already, and Vivien's ready to run up to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, Isobel, aren't we good?\" cried Vivien, with her good-night kiss\r\nto Isobel.\r\n\r\n\"Any reward?\" asked Harry, as the door closed behind his _fiancee_.\r\n\r\n\"What do you ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"A walk to the gate. And--perhaps--an explanation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly no explanation. I don't mind five minutes' walk to the gate.\"\r\n\r\nThis time very little was said on the way to the gate. A constraint\r\nseemed to fall on both of them. The night felt very silent, very still;\r\nthe lake stretched silent and still too, mysteriously tranquil.\r\n\r\nAt last Harry spoke. \"You've forgiven me--quite?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes. Naturally you didn't think how--how it seemed to me. It isn't\r\nalways easy to--\" She paused for a moment, looking over the water. \"But\r\nit's my place in life--for the present, at all events.\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't be for long. It can't be.\" He laughed. \"But I must take\r\ncare--compliments barred!\"\r\n\r\n\"From you to me--yes.\"\r\n\r\nAgain her words--or the way she said them--stirred him to an eager\r\ncuriosity. She half said things, or said things with half-meanings. Was\r\nthat art or accident? She did not say \"from an engaged man to his\r\n_fiancee's_ companion,\" but \"from you to me.\" Was the concrete--the\r\npersonal--form significant?\r\n\r\nNo more passed, save only, at the gate, \"Good-night.\" But with the word\r\nshe gave him her hand and smiled at him--and ever so slightly shook her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThe next day, and the next, and the next, she left Vivien and him\r\nentirely to themselves, save when meals forced her to appear; and on\r\nnone of the three nights would she walk with him to the gate, though he\r\nasked twice in words and the third time with his eyes. Was that what the\r\nlittle shake of her head had meant? But the two walks had left their\r\nmark. Harry chaffed and teased no more.\r\n\r\nVivien praised his forbearance, adding, \"I really think you hurt her\r\nfeelings a little, Harry. But it was being rather absurdly touchy,\r\nwasn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"She seems to be sensitive about her position.\"\r\n\r\nVivien made a little grimace. She was thinking that Isobel's position in\r\nthe house had been at least as pleasant as her own--till Harry came to\r\nwoo.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, confound this political business!\" Harry suddenly broke out. \"But\r\nfor that we could get married in the middle of August--as soon as your\r\nfather and my people are back. I hate this waiting till October, don't\r\nyou? Now you know you do, Vivien!\"\r\n\r\nShe put her hand on his and pressed it gently. \"Yes, but it's pleasant\r\nas it is. I'm not so very impatient--so long as I see you every day.\"\r\n\r\nBut Harry was impatient now, and rather restless. The days had ceased to\r\nglide by so easily, almost imperceptibly, in the company of his lover.\r\nThere was a feeling in him which did not make for peace--a recrudescence\r\nof those impulses of old days which his engagement was utterly to have\r\nbanished. Marriage was invoked to banish them utterly now. The sooner\r\nmarriage came, the better! Harry was ardent in his love-making that\r\nafternoon, and Vivien in a heaven of delight. If there was no chaff,\r\nthere was no appeal to Isobel for a walk to the gate either.\r\n\r\n\"I wish she wasn't there,\" he said to himself as he walked down, alone,\r\nto the gate at a punctual ten o'clock. Somehow his delight in his love\r\nfor Vivien, and in hers for him, was being marred. Ever so little, ever\r\nso faintly, yet still a little, his romance was turning to duty. A\r\ndelightful duty, of course, one in which his whole heart was engaged,\r\nbut still no longer just the one thing--the spontaneous voluntary\r\nthing--which filled his life. It had now an opposite. Besides all else\r\nthat it was, it had also--even now, even before that marriage so slow in\r\ncoming--taken on the aspect of the right thing. In the remote corners of\r\nhis mind--banished to those--hovered the shadowy image of its opposite.\r\nQuite impossible that the image should put on bones and flesh--should\r\ntake life! Yes, Harry was sure of that. But even its phantom presence\r\nwas disturbing.\r\n\r\n\"I thought I'd got rid of all that!\" Some such protest, yet even vaguer\r\nand less formulated, stirred in his thoughts. He conceived that he had\r\nbecome superior to temptation. Had he? For he was objecting to being\r\ntempted. Who tempted him? Did she--or only he himself, the man he was?\r\nThe question hung doubtful, and thereby pressed him the closer. He\r\nflattered himself that he knew women. What else had he to show for a\r\ngood deal of time--to say nothing of wear and tear of the emotions? Here\r\nwas a woman whose meaning, whose feeling towards himself, he did not\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nAndy Hayes was free the next afternoon--his half-holiday. Harry picked\r\nhim up at his lodgings and carried him with him to Nutley. Harry was\r\nglad to have him, glad to hear all about Gilbert Foot and Co., even more\r\nglad to see his own position through Andy's eyes. Andy's vision was\r\nalways so normal, so sane, so simple; his assumptions were always so\r\nright. A man really had only to live up to Andy's assumptions to be\r\nperfectly right. He assumed that a man was honest, straight,\r\nsingle-minded--unreservedly and exclusively in love with the girl he was\r\ngoing to marry. Why, of course a man was! Or why marry her? Even\r\nfoolishly in love with her? Rather spoonily, as some might think? Andy,\r\nperhaps, went so far as to assume that. Well, it was a most healthy\r\nassumption--eminently right on the practical side; primitive perhaps,\r\nbut tremendously right.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take Miss Vintry off your hands. Don't be afraid about that!\"\r\nlaughed Andy.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that you'll be allowed to. You're no end of a favourite of\r\nVivien's. She often talks about you. In fact I think I'm a bit jealous,\r\nAndy!\"\r\n\r\nAndy's presence seemed to restore his balance, which had seemed\r\nshaken--even if very slightly. He found himself again dwelling on the\r\ncharms of Vivien, recalling her pretty ways and the shy touches of\r\nhumour that sometimes ornamented her timidity.\r\n\r\n\"I asked her the other day--I was playing the fool, you know--what she\r\nwould do if I forsook her. What do think she said?\"\r\n\r\nAndy was prepared for anything brilliant, but, naturally, unable to\r\nsuggest it.\r\n\r\n\"She said, 'Drown myself in the lake, Harry--or else send for Andy\r\nHayes.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she say that?\" cried Andy, hugely delighted, blushing as red as he\r\nhad when the Nun told him that he was attractive.\r\n\r\nIf Andy's simplicity and ready enthusiasm were congenial to some minds\r\nand some moods, to others they could be very exasperating. To have it\r\nassumed that you are feeling just what you ought to feel--or even rather\r\nmore than could in strictness be expected from you--may be a strain on\r\nyour patience. Harry had welcomed in Andy an assumption of this order;\r\nat the moment it helped him. Isobel gave a similar assumption about her\r\nfeelings a much less hearty welcome. While Harry and Vivien took a\r\nstroll by themselves after lunch, Andy sat by her and was enthusiastic\r\nabout them; he had forgotten the Nun's unjust hints.\r\n\r\nIsobel chafed. \"Oh, yes, it's all very ideal, I daresay, Mr. Hayes.\r\nLet's hope it'll last! But Mr. Harry's been in love before, hasn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most people have had a fancy or two.\" (Even he himself had indulged in\r\none.) \"This is quite different to him, I know. And how could anybody\r\nhelp being fond of her?\"\r\n\r\n\"At any rate she's pretty free from the dangers of competition down\r\nhere.\" She looked at Andy with a curious smile.\r\n\r\nHe laughed heartily. \"Yes, that's all right, anyhow! Not that it would\r\nmake any difference, I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it were only to show this simpleton--\" The angry thought was in her\r\nheart. But there was more. Harry's devotion was seeming very\r\nwhole-hearted that day. Had she lost her power to disturb it? Was Andy\r\nin the end right in leaving her utterly out of consideration? Every day\r\nnow and every hour it hurt her more to see Harry's handsome head ever\r\nbowed to Vivien, his eyes asking her love and receiving the loving\r\nanswer. A wave of jealousy and of defiance swept over her. Andy need not\r\nknow--she could afford to leave him in his folly. Vivien must not\r\nknow--that would be too inconvenient. But Harry himself--was he quite to\r\nforget those two walks to the gate? She burned to use her power. A\r\nletter from Wellgood had reached her that morning; it was not a proposal\r\nof marriage, but by his talk of future plans--of what was to happen\r\nafter Vivien left them--it assumed that she was still to be at Nutley.\r\nThe implication was definite; matters only awaited his return.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't had a single word with you--by ourselves--all day,\" said\r\nVivien to Andy after dinner. \"You'll walk with me, won't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"For my part I don't think I want to walk at all,\" said Harry. \"It's\r\nrather chilly. Will you keep me company indoors, and forgive my cigar,\r\nMiss Vintry?\"\r\n\r\nIsobel assented rather coldly, but her heart beat quicker. Now that the\r\nchance came--by no contrivance of hers and unexpectedly--she was\r\nsuddenly afraid of it, and afraid of what seemed a sudden revelation of\r\nthe strength of her feeling for Harry. She had meant to play with him,\r\nto show him that, if she was to be left out of the reckoning, it was by\r\nher own choice; to make him see her power fully for once before she hid\r\nit for ever. Could she carry out her dangerous programme? Harry had been\r\nat his gayest that night, just in the mood which had carried him to most\r\nof his conquests--gaily daring, skirting topics of gallantry with\r\ndefiant ease, provoking, yet never offending. If his eyes spoke true, he\r\nwas in the mood still.\r\n\r\n\"Only a week more!\" he said. \"Then papa-in-law comes back, and I go\r\nelectioneering. Well, I suppose we've had enough of what they call\r\ndalliance.\" He sank into an armchair by the fireplace, sighing in\r\npleasant indolence, lolling gracefully.\r\n\r\nThe long windows were open to the terrace; the evening air came in cool\r\nand sweet. She looked out on the terrace; Vivien and Andy had wandered\r\naway; they were not in sight. Vivien's wrap lay on a chair close to the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\"Vivien ought to have taken her wrap,\" said Isobel absently, as she came\r\nback and stood by the mantelpiece opposite Harry. Her cheeks were a\r\nlittle flushed and her eyes bright to-night; she responded to Harry's\r\ngaiety, his mood acted on hers.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do after we're--after the break-up here?\" he\r\nasked suddenly.\r\n\r\nShe smiled down at him, pausing a moment before she answered. \"You seem\r\nquite sure that there will be a complete break-up,\" she said.\r\n\r\nHe looked hard at her; she smiled steadily. \"Well, I know that Vivien\r\nwon't be here,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know that much too, Mr. Harry. But I suppose her father will.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that too. Which leaves only one of the party unaccounted\r\nfor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, only one of us unaccounted for.\"\r\n\r\n\"One that may be Miss Wellgood's companion, but could hardly be Mr.\r\nWellgood's. He can scarcely claim the privileges of old age yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think I ought to be looking out for another situation? But\r\nsupposing--merely supposing--Mr. Wellgood didn't agree?\"\r\n\r\nHarry flung his cigar into the grate. \"Do you mean--?\" he said slowly.\r\nShe gave a little laugh. He laughed too, rather uneasily. \"I say, you\r\ncan't mean--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't I? Well, I only said 'supposing.' And I think you chaffed me\r\nabout it yourself once. You forget what you say to women, Mr. Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Should you like it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Beggars mustn't be choosers. We can't all be as lucky as Vivien!\"\r\n\r\n\"Was I serious? No--I mean--are you? Wellgood!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why shouldn't I be? Or why shouldn't Mr. Wellgood? It seems absurd?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in Wellgood, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beggars mustn't be choosers.\"\r\n\r\n\"You a beggar! Why, you're--\"\r\n\r\n\"What am I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I break the rules?\"\r\n\r\nShe gave him a long look before answering. \"No, don't.\" Her voice shook\r\na little, her composure was less perfect.\r\n\r\nHarry was no novice; the break in the voice did not escape him. He\r\nmarked it with a thrill of triumph; it told him that she was not merely\r\nplaying with him; he was holding his own, he had his power. The fight\r\nwas equal. He rose to his feet and stood facing her, both of them by the\r\nmantelpiece.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want you to say anything about this to Vivien, because it's not\r\ndefinite yet. If the opportunity were offered to me, don't you think I\r\nshould be wise to accept?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you in love with him?\" He looked in her eyes. \"No, you can't be!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your standard of romance is so high. I like him--and perhaps I don't\r\nlike looking out for another situation.\" Her tone was lighter; she\r\nseemed mistress of herself again. But Harry had not forgotten the break\r\nin her voice.\r\n\r\n\"Have you considered that this arrangement--\"\r\n\r\n\"Which we have supposed--\"\r\n\r\n\"Would make you my mother-in-law?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, your stepmother-in-law. That doesn't sound quite so oppressive, I\r\nhope?\"\r\n\r\n\"They both sound to me considerably absurd.\"\r\n\r\n\"I really can't see why they should.\"\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met in confidence, mirthful and defiant. They fought their\r\nduel now, forgetful of everybody except themselves. His old spirit had\r\nseized on Harry; it carried him away. She gave herself up to the delight\r\nof her triumph and to the pleasure that his challenge gave her. Out of\r\nsight, out of mind, were Vivien and Andy.\r\n\r\n\"But relationship has its consolations, its privileges,\" said Harry,\r\nleaning towards her, his face alight with mischievous merriment. He\r\noffered her his hand. \"At all events, accept my congratulations.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave him her hand. \"You're premature, both with congratulations and\r\nwith relationship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm always in a hurry about things,\" laughed Harry, holding her\r\nhand. He leant closer yet; his face was very near hers now--his comely\r\nface with its laughing luring eyes. She did not retreat. Harry saw in\r\nher eyes, in her flushed cheeks and quickened breath, in her\r\nmotionlessness, the permission that he sought. Bending, he kissed her\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\nShe gave a little laugh, triumphant, yet deprecatory and nervous. Her\r\nface was all aflame. Harry's gaze was on her; slowly he released her\r\nhand. She stood an instant longer, then, with a shrug of her shoulders,\r\nwalked across the room towards the windows. Harry stood watching her,\r\nexultant and merry still.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she came to a stand. She spoke without looking round. \"Vivien's\r\nshawl was on that chair.\"\r\n\r\nThe words hardly reached his preoccupied brain. \"What? Whose shawl?\"\r\n\r\nShe turned round slowly. \"Vivien's shawl was on that chair, and it's\r\ngone,\" she said.\r\n\r\nHarry darted past her to the window, and looked out. He came back to her\r\non tiptoe and whispered, \"Andy! He's about two-thirds of the way across\r\nthe terrace with the thing now.\"\r\n\r\n\"He must have come in just a moment ago,\" she whispered in return.\r\n\r\nHarry nodded. \"Yes--just a moment ago. I wonder--!\" He pursed up his\r\nlips, but still there was a laughing devil in his eye. \"Lucky she didn't\r\ncome for it herself!\" he said. \"But--well, I wonder!\"\r\n\r\nShe laid her finger on her lips. They heard steps approaching, and\r\nVivien's merry voice. Harry made a queer, half-puzzled, half-amused\r\ngrimace. Isobel walked quickly on to the terrace. Inside the light fell\r\ntoo mercilessly on her cheeks; she would meet them beneath the friendly\r\ncover of the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII.\r\n\r\nCONCERNING A STOLEN KISS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA stolen kiss may mean very different things--almost nothing (not quite\r\nnothing, or why steal it?), something yet not too much, or well-nigh\r\neverything. The two parties need not give it the same value; a witness\r\nof it is not, of necessity, bound by the valuation of either of them. It\r\nmay be merely a jest, of such taste as charity can allow in the\r\ncircumstances; it may be the crown and end of a slight and passing\r\nflirtation; it may be the first visible mark of a passion destined to\r\ngrow to fierce intensity. Or it may seem utterly evasive in its\r\nsignificance at the moment, as it were indecipherable and imponderable,\r\nwaiting to receive from the future its meaning and its weight.\r\n\r\nThe last man to find his way through a maze of emotional analysis was\r\nAndy Hayes; his mind held no thread of experience whereby to track the\r\npath, his temperament no instinct to divine it. He could not assign a\r\nvalue--or values--to the incident of which chance had made him a\r\nwitness; what Harry's impulse, Isobel's obvious acceptance of it, the\r\nintensity and absorption that marked the bearing of the two in the brief\r\nmoment in which he saw them as he lifted Vivien's shawl, stood looking\r\nfor a flash of time, and quickly turned away--what these things meant or\r\namounted to he could not tell. But there was no uncertainty about his\r\nfeelings; he was filled with deep distaste. He was not a man of\r\nimpracticable ideals--his mind walked always in the mean--but he was\r\nnaturally averse from intrigue, from underhand doings, from the playing\r\nof double parts. They were traitors in this thing; let it mean the least\r\nit could, even to mere levity or unbecoming jocularity (their faces rose\r\nin his mind to contradict this view even as he put it), still they were\r\nso far traitors. The first brunt of his censure fell on Isobel, but his\r\nallegiance to Harry was also so sorely shaken that it seemed as though\r\nit could never be the same again. The engagement had been to Andy a\r\nsacrosanct thing; it was now sacrilegiously defaced by the hands of the\r\ntwo most bound to guard it. \"Very low-down!\" was Andy's humble phrase of\r\ncondemnation--at least very low-down; how much more he knew not but that\r\nin the best view of the case. At the moment his heart had gone out to\r\nVivien in a great pang of compassion; it seemed such a shame to tamper\r\nwith, even if not actually to betray, a trust like hers. His face, like\r\nIsobel's, had been red--but red with anger--under the cover of the\r\nnight. He was echoing the Nun's \"Poor girl!\" which in loyalty to his\r\nfriend he had before resented.\r\n\r\nHis first impulse had been to shield Vivien from any suspicion; it\r\ntaught him a new cunning, an hypocrisy not his own. If Isobel delayed\r\ntheir return to the brightly lighted room, he did not hurry it--let all\r\nthe faces have time to recover! But his voice was calm and unmoved; for\r\nhim he was even talkative and exuberant. When they went in, he met Harry\r\nwith an unembarrassed air. Relief rose in Isobel; yet Harry doubted. So\r\nfar as Harry could reason, he must have all but seen, probably had\r\nactually seen. And in one thing there was significance. He went on\r\ndevoting himself to Vivien; he did not efface himself in Harry's favour,\r\nas his wont was. He seemed to make his presence a fence round her,\r\nforbidding her lover's approach. Harry, now talking trifles to Isobel,\r\nwatched him keenly, hardly doubting, hardly venturing to hope.\r\n\r\n\"Till lunch to-morrow, Harry,\" said Vivien gaily, when the time for\r\ngood-night came. \"You'll come too, won't you, Mr. Hayes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks awfully, but I'm off for a big tramp.\"\r\n\r\n\"To dinner then?\" asked Isobel very graciously.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks awfully, but I--I really must sup with old Jack.\"\r\n\r\nThe quickest glance ran from Harry to Isobel.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done? Take the chance--the bare chance--that he had not\r\nseen anything, or not seen all? Or confess the indiscretion and plead\r\nits triviality--with a vow of penitence, serious if Andy must be serious\r\nover such a trifle, light if he proved man of the world enough to join\r\nin laughing it off? No, Harry would take the chance, poor as it was.\r\nEven if Andy had seen, how could he interfere? To confess, however\r\nlightly, would be to give him a standing in the case, a right to put his\r\noar in. It would be silly to do that; as matters stood now, his title\r\ncould be denied if he sought to meddle. He knew Andy well enough to be\r\nsure that he would do nothing against him without fair warning. If he\r\nmeant to tell tales to Vivien or to Wellgood, he would warn Harry first.\r\nTime enough to wrestle with him then! Meanwhile they--he was coupling\r\nIsobel with himself--would stand on the defensive; nothing should be\r\nadmitted, everything should be ignored.\r\n\r\nSo much for Andy! He was assessed--a possible danger, a certain cause\r\nfor vigilance, also, it must be confessed, rather an uncomfortable\r\npresence, an embarrassing witness of his friend's orthodox love-making,\r\nas he had been an unwilling one of his heterodox. Meanwhile Harry's tact\r\nwas equal to the walk back to Meriton, Andy proving inclined to silence\r\nbut not unfriendly or morose, still less actively aggressive or\r\nreproachful. And he would not be at Meriton to-morrow. The word could be\r\npassed to Isobel--be careful but say nothing! Very careful in Andy's\r\npresence--but no admissions to be made!\r\n\r\nAye, so much for Andy! But besides the witness there are the parties.\r\nBesides the person who catches you kissing, there is the person you\r\nkiss. There is also you, who kiss. All questions of value are not\r\ndecided by the impression you chance to make on the witness. The\r\nbystander may see most of the game; the players settle the stakes.\r\n\r\n\"Perverse!\" was Harry's verdict on the whole affair, given from his own\r\npoint of view; not only perverse that he should have been caught--if he\r\nhad been--but no less perverse that he should have done the thing, that\r\nhe should have wanted to do it, and that he should feel as he now did\r\nabout it. Perhaps the last element was really the most perverse of all,\r\nbecause it set up in his mind an opposition to what was plainly the only\r\ncourse open to him from Isobel's point of view. (Here the question of\r\nthe third value came in.) That was surely open and avowed penitence--a\r\nsincere apology, as serious or as light as was demanded or would be\r\naccepted. She could not pretend that she felt outraged. In truth they\r\nhad shared in the indiscretion and been partners in the peccadillo. An\r\napology not too abject, a hint at the temptation, gracefully put, to\r\nserve for excuse, a return to the safe ground of friendship--and a total\r\noblivion of the incident! Or, if they must think of it at all, it would\r\nbe without words--with a smile, maybe, in a few days' time; that is how\r\nwe feel about some not serious, by no means unpleasant, little scrape\r\nthat is well over. Harry had been in a good many such--perverse but not\r\nfatal, annoying at the time, not necessarily things on which the memory\r\ndwelt with pain in after days; far from it sometimes, in fact.\r\n\r\nThat was the right thing to do, and the right way to regard the episode.\r\nBut Harry was conscious of a complication--in the circumstances and in\r\nhis own feelings. Owing to his engagement with Vivien he must go on\r\nfrequenting Isobel's society; owing to the memory of his kiss the\r\nnecessity was not distasteful. Well, these little complications must be\r\nunravelled; the first difficulty faced, the second ignored or overcome.\r\nHe arrived at so clear, sound, and prudent a resolution thus to minimise\r\nthe effects of his indiscretion that he felt almost more virtuous than\r\nif he had been discreet.\r\n\r\nSo the parties, as well as the witness, were assessed. But who had put\r\ninto his hand the standard whereby to assess Isobel? She might measure\r\nby another rule.\r\n\r\nThe confession--and absolution--thus virtuously and comfortably planned\r\ndid not take place the next day, for the simple reason that Miss Vintry\r\nafforded no opportunity for them; she was ill and invisible. On the\r\nfollowing day she was on a sofa. Immediately on his appearance, Harry\r\nwas sent home again, Vivien declaring that she must be in unremitting\r\nattendance on her friend. The third day matters seemed back on their\r\nusual footing; but still he got no private word with Isobel. Once or\r\ntwice he caught her looking at him in what seemed a thoughtful way; when\r\nobserved, she averted her glance, but without embarrassment. Perhaps\r\nthis avoidance of all chance of private talk--of all possibility of\r\nreferring to the incident--was her way of treating it; perhaps she meant\r\nto dispense with apology and go straight to oblivion. If that were her\r\nintention, she misjudged Harry's feelings. He felt baulked of his scheme\r\nof confession and absolution--baulked and tantalized. He felt almost\r\ninsulted--did she not think him gentleman enough to apologise? He felt\r\ncurious--did she not feel the desire for an apology herself? He felt\r\namazed--had she no anxiety about Andy? The net result was that he could\r\nthink of little else than of her and of the incident. And under these\r\ncircumstances he had to carry on his orthodox love-making! The way of\r\ntrangressors is said to be hard; at moments Harry felt his worse than\r\nthat; it had a tendency to become ridiculous.\r\n\r\nAgainst this abhorred peril he struck back vigorously and instinctively\r\non effective lines. He could hold his own in a duel of the sexes. His\r\ncourt of Vivien not only seemed but became more ardent--in these matters\r\nthe distinction between being and seeming runs very thin, since the\r\nacting excites the reality. If one woman teased him, occupying his\r\nthoughts without satisfying his desire, he turned to the adoration of\r\nanother, and gave her of his own that hers might be more complete.\r\nAdoring Vivien found herself adored; Harry's worship would break out\r\neven in Isobel's presence! He who had been rather too content to accept\r\nnow asked; she could not do enough to witness her love.\r\nHalf-unconsciously fighting for a victory he less than consciously\r\ndesired, he struck at Isobel through Vivien--and made Vivien supremely\r\nhappy. Happiness gave her confidence; confidence gave her new charm, a\r\nnew vivacity, a daring to speak her gay and loving thoughts. Who should\r\nnot listen if Harry loved to hear? Her growth in power to allure made\r\nHarry wonder that he could not love single-heartedly, why his\r\nrecollection of the incident remained so fresh and so ever-present. If\r\nIsobel would give him a chance to wind it up! It was troublesome now\r\nonly because it hung in a mystery created by her silence, because the\r\nmemory of it was irritated by a curiosity which her evasion of him\r\nmaintained. Did she think it nothing? Or could she not bear to speak of\r\nit, because it was so much more? At any rate she should see how he loved\r\nVivien!\r\n\r\nThe three had this week to themselves--Andy engulfed in town and Gilbert\r\nFoot and Co., Wellgood not due back till the Saturday. So they passed\r\nit--Vivien in a new ecstasy; Harry ardent, troubled, wondering; Isobel\r\napart, thoughtful, impossible to read. Thus they came to the Friday.\r\nTo-morrow Wellgood would be back. Harry, thinking on this, thought\r\nsuddenly of what had led up to the incident--what had been the excuse,\r\nthe avenue, for his venture. It had been absorbed in the incident\r\nitself. Wellgood's coming gave it back to independent life. If what\r\nIsobel had said were true, another lover entered on the scene--Isobel's!\r\n\r\nThat night--when Harry had gone--Vivien came to Isobel and kissed her,\r\nsaying, \"It's wonderful, but to-night I'm sure!\"\r\n\r\nIsobel was looking at an illustrated paper. She let her hand rest in\r\nVivien's, but she did not raise her eyes from the pictures. \"Silly\r\nchild, you've been sure all along!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not as I am to-night. I've been sure I pleased him, that he liked me,\r\nthat he liked my love. I've never been sure that he really wanted it\r\ntill the last two or three days.\" She paused a moment, and added softly,\r\n\"Never sure he must have it, as much as I must have his!\"\r\n\r\nIsobel's paper slipped from her knees on to the floor, but still she did\r\nnot look at Vivien.\r\n\r\n\"It's a wonderful feeling that,\" the girl went on; \"to feel he must have\r\nit--that he must have my love as I must have his. Before he seemed to be\r\ndoing all the giving--and I could hardly believe! Now I'm giving\r\ntoo--we're sharing. Somehow it makes a woman of me.\" She playfully\r\ncaressed Isobel's hand, running fingers lightly over fingers. \"I don't\r\nbelieve I'm afraid even of you any more!\" Her tone was gay,\r\naffectionately bantering.\r\n\r\nNow Isobel looked up at her as she leant over her shoulder. \"It makes\r\nyou look very pretty.\"\r\n\r\n\"It makes me feel prettier still,\" laughed Vivien. She put her face\r\nclose to her friend's and whispered, blushing, \"He kisses me differently\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nIsobel Vintry sharply drew her hand away. Vivien's blush grew painfully\r\nbright.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I--I oughtn't to have said that. You're right, Isobel. It's--it's\r\ntoo sacred. But I was so happy in it. Do forgive me, dear. I've got no\r\nmother to talk to, Isobel. Not even a sister! I know what you felt, but\r\nyou must forgive me.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing to forgive, child. I meant nothing when I took my hand\r\naway. I was going to pick up the paper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then kiss me, Isobel.\"\r\n\r\nIsobel slowly turned her head and kissed the girl's cheek. \"I know what\r\nyou mean, Vivien,\" she said with a smile that to the girl seemed\r\nwistful, almost bitter.\r\n\r\n\"You dear!\" she whispered. \"Some day you must be very happy too.\" Her\r\nvoice carolled in song as she sped upstairs.\r\n\r\n\"The good which I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I\r\ndo.\" That--and possibly one other--reminiscence of the Scriptures came\r\nback to Isobel Vintry when, with a kiss, she had dismissed Vivien to her\r\nhappy rest. There was another law, warring against the law of her\r\nmind--the law of the Restless and Savage Master. He broke friendship's\r\npower and blurred the mirror of loyalty. He drove her whither she would\r\nnot go, commanded her to set her hand to what she would not touch,\r\nforced love to mate with loathing. \"The child is so beautifully happy,\"\r\nher spirit cried. \"Aye, in Harry Belfield's kisses,\" came the Master's\r\nanswer. \"Wouldn't she be? You've tasted them. You know.\" She knew. They\r\nwere different now! From those he had given Vivien before? Yes. From the\r\none he had given her? Or like that one? Her jealousy caught fresh flame\r\nfrom Vivien's shy revelation--fresh flame and new shame. Harry was\r\nrepenting--with smiles of memory. She was sinning still, with groans,\r\nwith all her cunning, and with all her might. Pass the theory that it is\r\neach man for himself in this fight, and each woman for her own hand. No\r\ndoubt; but should not the fight be fair? The girl did not so much as\r\nknow there was a fight, and should not and must not, unless and until it\r\nhad gone irrevocably against her. \"All's fair in love--and war.\" Yet\r\ntraitors suffer death from their own side and the enemy's contempt.\r\n\r\nHis kisses were different now--that set her aflame. Aye, and to mark how\r\nunder their new charm Vivien opened into new power and took hold on new\r\nweapons! The new kisses somehow made a woman of her! It might be\r\ntolerable to see him make his marriage of convenience, doing no more\r\nthan somewhat indolently allowing himself to be adored. But to see him\r\nadoring this other--that was to be worsted on the merits--not merely to\r\nbe impossible, but to be undesired. Was that coming about? Had it come\r\nabout--so soon after the stolen kiss? Then the kiss had been all\r\nfailure, all shame; he had mocked while he kissed. She was cheapened,\r\nyet not aided. The cunning of the last six days had been bent to prove\r\nthat she had been aided--her value not cheapened but enhanced.\r\n\r\nLooking again out of the window whence she had watched the pair at their\r\nlove-making, looking over the terrace, now empty, across the water\r\n(water seems ever to answer to the onlooker's mood), she exclaimed\r\nagainst the absence of safeguards. Were she a wife--or were Vivien! That\r\nwould be a fence, making for protection--a sturdy fence, which to break\r\ndown or to leap over would be plain trespassing, a profanation, open\r\noffence. Were she--or were Vivien--a mother! The Savage Master himself\r\nmust own a worthy foe in motherhood--one that gave him trouble, one that\r\nhe vanquished only after hard fighting, and then saw his victory\r\nbitterly grudged, piteously wept over, deplored in a heart-rending\r\nfashion; you could see that in the morning's paper. She chanced to have\r\nread such a case a day or two before. The letter of confession was\r\nsigned \"Mother the outcast.\" To have to sign like that--if you let the\r\nMaster beat you--was a deterrent, a safeguard, a shield. Such defences\r\nshe had not. Vivien was neither wife nor mother; no more was she. The\r\nengagement seemed but victory in the first bout; was it forbidden to try\r\nthe best of three? Nothing was irrevocable yet--on either side. \"At\r\nlovers' vows--!\" Or a stolen kiss! Or a stolen victory?\r\n\r\nSuddenly she remembered, and with the same quality of smile as Vivien\r\nhad marked, that she had been an exemplary child, ever extolled, never\r\npunished; a pattern schoolgirl, with the highest marks, Queen on May-day\r\n(a throne not to be achieved without the Principal's _conge d'elire!_),\r\na model student at Cambridge. Hence the unexceptionable credentials\r\nwhich had introduced her to Nutley, had made her Vivien's preceptress,\r\nVivien's bulwark against fear and weakness, Vivien's shield--and\r\ndestined to be a shield to successive young ladies after Vivien. Who\r\nfirst had undermined that accepted view of destiny, had disordered that\r\nwell-schooled, almost Sunday-schooled, scheme of her life? Vivien's\r\nfather, who came back to-morrow. At whose challenge was the shaken\r\nfortress like to fall? Vivien's lover, who came yesterday and the day\r\nbefore, to-morrow and the day after, every day till he went out of life\r\nwith Vivien.\r\n\r\nAs with minds greatly preoccupied, the ordinary traffic of the hours\r\npassed unnoticed; bed, sleep, breakfast, were a moment. She found\r\nherself greeting Wellgood, newly arrived, ruddy and robust, confident,\r\nself-satisfied--as she saw in a moment, eager. His kiss to his daughter\r\nwas carelessly kind, and with it he let her go, she not unwilling; Harry\r\nwas due at the gate. Wellgood's real greeting was for the woman whom to\r\nsee was his home-coming. He led her with him into his study; he laid his\r\nhand on her arm as he made her sit down near him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, have the lovers bored you to death with their spooning since I've\r\nbeen away?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's been a good deal of it, and not much relief. Only Andy Hayes\r\nnow and then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather tiresome to be the onlooker all the time. Wouldn't you like a\r\nlittle on your own account?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm in no hurry.\" She looked him straight in the face, rather\r\ndefiantly.\r\n\r\n\"I've made up my mind since I've been away. I'm not a good hand at\r\nspeeches or at spooning, but I'm fond of you, Isobel. I'll make you a\r\ngood husband--and it's for you to consider whether you'll ever get a\r\nbetter chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like more time to think it over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come, don't tell me you haven't been thinking it over for weeks\r\npast. What's the difficulty?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not in love with you--that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't expect to inspire a romantic passion, like young Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you leave Harry Belfield out of it?\" she asked irritably.\r\n\r\n\"I see he has bored you,\" chuckled Wellgood. \"But you like me? We get on\r\ntogether?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I like you, and we get on together. But I don't want to marry\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\n\"No more do I--just yet!\" He rose and went to the mantelpiece to choose\r\na pipe. \"Have you got any friends you could stay a month with?\"\r\n\r\nHis back was to her; he was busy filling the pipe. He saw neither the\r\nsudden stiffening of her figure nor the fear in her eyes. Was he going\r\nto send her away--now? But she answered coolly, \"Yes, I think I could\r\narrange it, if you wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Somehow a man feels rather a fool, being engaged himself while his\r\ngirl's getting married. We should have all the idiots in the\r\nneighbourhood buzzing about with their jokes and congratulations. I've\r\nmade a plan to avoid all that. We keep it quite dark till Vivien's\r\nwedding; then you go off, ostensibly for good. I stay here and give the\r\nplace an overhauling; then I'll join you in town, we'll be married\r\nthere, and go for a jaunt. By the time we come back they'll have cooled\r\ndown--and they'll be jolly glad to have shirked their wedding presents.\"\r\nBy now he had turned round; the strain and the fear had passed from\r\nIsobel; the month's visit to friends was not to come now. \"How do you\r\nlike the scheme?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I like the scheme very much, and I'm all for keeping it quiet till\r\nVivien is disposed of.\"\r\n\r\nHe stood before her, smoking his pipe, his hands in his pockets. \"Shall\r\nwe call it settled?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to call it settled yet.\"\r\n\r\nHe put down his pipe. \"Look here, Isobel, because I can't make pretty\r\nspeeches, don't you think I don't feel this thing. I want you, and I\r\nwant the thing settled. You ought to know your mind by now. If you want\r\nto say no, you can say it now, but I don't believe you do. Then why\r\ncan't you say yes? It's devilishly uncomfortable to go on living in the\r\nhouse with you while the thing's unsettled.\"\r\n\r\nWould the visit come into play after all, unless she consented? Isobel\r\nsat in thought.\r\n\r\n\"Just understood between ourselves--that's what I mean. I shan't bother\r\nyou with much love-making, as I daresay you can guess.\"\r\n\r\nShe had cried out for a fence, a protection. Did not one offer itself\r\nnow? It might prove of service. She saw that the man loved her in his\r\nrough way; his love might help her. For the time, at least, his honest\r\nsincerity of affection touched her heart. His \"I want you\" was grateful\r\nto her. That other thing--the thing to which the stolen kiss\r\nbelonged--was madness. Surely she had resolution to withstand it and to\r\ndo what was wise? Surely she could be honest? If only because, in all\r\nlikelihood, dishonesty led nowhere.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose I said yes--and changed my mind?\" She was trying to be\r\nhonest--or perhaps to put herself in a position to maintain that she had\r\nbeen honest, if need arose.\r\n\r\n\"I must take my chance of that, like other men,\" laughed Wellgood. \"But,\r\nlike other men too, I don't suppose I should be very pleasant about it.\r\nEspecially not if there was another fellow!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't suppose you would.\" She smiled at him for a moment; he\r\nshowed there a side of him that she liked--his courage, his\r\nself-confidence, his power to stand up for himself.\r\n\r\n\"You leave it to me to keep you when once I've got you,\" he went on,\r\nsmiling grimly. \"That's my affair; you'll find I shall look after it.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled back at him--defiance in return for his grimness. \"Very well,\r\nI'll leave it to you to keep me. After all, there's no reason to expect\r\ncompetition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in Meriton, perhaps! But what of London, Miss Isobel? I must keep\r\nan eye on you there!\" He took hold of her hands and pulled her to her\r\nfeet. \"It's a promise?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the way I've told you--yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's good enough for me!\" He drew her to him and kissed her. \"We\r\nshan't have many chances of kissing--or we should give the thing away.\r\nBut give me one now, Isobel!\"\r\n\r\nShe did as she was bid in a very friendly fashion. His kiss had been\r\nhearty but not passionate, and hers was an adequate response. It left\r\nWellgood entirely content.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right! Gad, I feel ten years younger! You shan't repent it.\r\nI'll look after you well--while I'm alive and after I'm gone too. Don't\r\nbe afraid about that. Perhaps there'll be somebody else to look after\r\nyou, by the time I get notice to quit. I'd like to leave a Wellgood of\r\nNutley behind me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, that's sentimental?\" said Isobel. \"Mere sentiment!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it, miss. It's a sound natural instinct, and I'm proud of\r\nit.\" He kissed her again. \"Now be off, there's a good girl. I've got a\r\nthousand things to do, and probably everything's been going to the devil\r\nwhile I've been away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I rather pity everybody now you've come back!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you worry. I know I shall find your department in good order. Be\r\noff!\" He took her by the shoulders in a rough playfulness and turned her\r\ntowards the door. She left him chuckling to himself. He was very content\r\nwith the issue of his suit.\r\n\r\nWas her department in good order? Her lips twisted in a wry smile.\r\n\r\nAs she approached the drawing-room door, Harry Belfield came out of it.\r\nHe started a little to see her--not that it was strange she should be\r\nthere, but because he had not seen her alone since the night of the\r\nstolen kiss. He closed the door behind him and came to her.\r\n\r\n\"Vivien\"--a jerk of his head told that Vivien was in the\r\ndrawing-room--\"has sent me to say 'How do you do?' to Mr. Wellgood.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's in his study, Mr. Harry. Don't stay long. He's very busy.\" She\r\ndrew aside, to let him pass, but Harry stood still.\r\n\r\n\"Are you never going to give me an opportunity?\" he asked in a low\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"An opportunity for what?\"\r\n\r\nHarry jumped at the chance of his confession and absolution. \"Why, of\r\nsaying how awfully sorry and--and ashamed I am that I yielded--\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the use of saying anything about it? It's best forgotten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now Wellgood's back?\" he whispered, with a flash of his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly best forgotten, now that Vivien's father is back.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head at her with a smile, owning her skilful parry. \"You\r\nwon't give me one chance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does the dashing Mr. Harry Belfield need to have chances given him? I\r\nthought he made them for himself.\"\r\n\r\nHarry's eyes gleamed. \"I'll take you at your word in that!\"\r\n\r\n\"You've been in no hurry about it up to now--and you seem in none to say\r\n'How do you do?' to Mr. Wellgood.\" She motioned him to go on, adding,\r\n\"It was very silly, but no harm's done. We'll forget.\"\r\n\r\nHarry gave her a long look. She met it with a steady smile. He held out\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. We'll forget. There's my hand on it.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave a little laugh, shook her head, and put her hands behind her\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"I seem to remember it began that way before,\" she said, and darted past\r\nhim swiftly.\r\n\r\nThat was how they set about forgetting the stolen kiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII.\r\n\r\nA LOVER LOOKS PALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt speedily appeared that Gilly Foot had other than pecuniary reasons\r\nfor wanting a partner; he wanted a pair of hands to work for him. He was\r\nlazy, at times even lethargic; nothing could make him hurry. He hated\r\ndetails, and, above all other details, figures. His work was to hatch\r\nideas; somebody else had to bring up the chickens. Andy could hardly\r\nhave allowed the cool shuffling-off of all the practical business work\r\non to his shoulders--which was what happened as soon as he had learnt\r\neven the rudiments of it--had it not been that the ideas were good. The\r\nindolent young man would sit all the morning--not that his morning began\r\nvery early--apparently doing nothing, then spend two hours at lunch at\r\nthe restaurant, come back smoking a large cigar, and after another\r\nhour's rumination be delivered of an idea. The budding business--Andy\r\nwondered how it had even budded under a gardener who no doubt planted\r\nbut never watered--lay mainly with educational works; and here Gilly's\r\ningenuity came in. He was marvellously good at guessing what would\r\nappeal to a schoolmaster; how or whence he got this instinct it was\r\nimpossible to say; it seemed just a freak of genius. The prospectus of a\r\nnew \"series,\" or the \"syllabus\" of a new course of study (contained in\r\nMessrs. Gilbert Foot and Co.'s primers) became in his hands a most\r\nskilful bait. And if he hooked one schoolmaster, as he pointed out to\r\nAndy, it was equivalent to hooking scores, perhaps hundreds, conceivably\r\nthousands, of boys. Girls too perhaps! Gilly was all for the higher\r\neducation of girls. Generations of the youth of both sexes rose before\r\nhis prophetically sanguine eye, all brought up on Gilbert Foot and Co.'s\r\nprimers.\r\n\r\n\"A single really good idea for a series may mean a small fortune, Andy,\"\r\nhe would say impressively. \"And now I think I may as well go to lunch.\"\r\n\r\nAndy accepted the situation and did the hard work. He also provided his\r\npartner with a note-book, urging him to put down (or, failing that, to\r\nget somebody else to put down) any brilliant idea which occurred to him\r\nat lunch. For himself he made a rule--lunch at the restaurant not more\r\nthan once a week. Only ideas justified lunch there every day. Lunch\r\nthere might be good for ideas; it was not good for figures.\r\n\r\nSo Andy was working hard, no less hard than when he was trying to drag\r\nhis poor timber business out of the mud, but with far more heart, hope,\r\nand zest. He buckled to the figures; he bargained with the gentlemen who\r\nwrote the primers, with the printers, and the binders, and the\r\nadvertisement canvassers; he tracked shy discounts to their lairs, and\r\nbagged them; his eye on office expenses was the eye of a lynx. The\r\nchickens hatched by Gilly found a loving and assiduous foster-mother.\r\nAnd in September, after the new primers had been packed off to meet the\r\nboys going back to school, Andy was to have a holiday; he was looking\r\nforward to it intensely. He meant to spend it in attending Harry\r\nBelfield on his autumn campaign in the Meriton Division--an odd idea of\r\na holiday to most men's thinking, but Harry was still Harry, and Andy's\r\nappetite for new experiences had lost none of its voracity. Meanwhile,\r\nfor recreation, there was Sunday with its old programme of church, a\r\ntramp, and supper with Jack Rock; there was lunch on Friday at the\r\nrestaurant with the Nun--she never missed Andy's day--and other friends;\r\nand on both the Saturdays which followed the Belfields' return home he\r\nwas bidden to dine at Halton.\r\n\r\nThat the Nun had taken a fancy to him he had been informed by that\r\ncandid young woman herself; her assurance that he was \"attractive\" held\r\ngood as regarded Belfield at least; even Andy's modesty could not deny\r\nthat. Belfield singled him out for especial attention, drew him out,\r\nlistened to him, advised him. It was at the first of the two evenings at\r\nHalton that he kept Andy with him after dinner, while the rest went into\r\nthe garden--Wellgood and Vivien were there, but not Isobel, who had\r\npleaded a cold--and insisted on hearing all about his business,\r\nlistening with evident interest to Andy's description of it and of his\r\npartner, Gilly Foot.\r\n\r\n\"And in your holiday you're going to help Harry, I hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Help him!\" laughed Andy. \"I'm going to listen to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I recommend you to try your own hand too. You couldn't have a better\r\nopportunity of learning the job than at these village meetings.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could never do it. It never entered my head. Why, I know nothing!\"\r\n\r\n\"More than your audience; that's enough. If you do break down at first,\r\nit doesn't matter. After a month of it you wouldn't mind Trafalgar\r\nSquare.\"\r\n\r\n\"The--the idea's absolutely new to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"So have a lot of things been lately, haven't they? And they're turning\r\nout well.\"\r\n\r\nA slow smile spread over Andy's face. \"I should look a fool,\" he\r\nreflected.\r\n\r\n\"Try it,\" said Belfield, quite content with the reception of his\r\nsuggestion. He saw that Andy would turn it over in his mind, would give\r\nit full, careful, impartial consideration. He was coming to have no\r\nsmall idea of Andy's mind. He passed to another topic.\r\n\r\n\"You were at Nutley two or three times when we were away, Harry tells\r\nme. Everything seems going on very pleasantly?\"\r\n\r\nAndy recalled himself with a start from his rumination over a possible\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes--er--it looks like it, Mr. Belfield.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Harry's not been to town more than once or twice!\" He smiled. \"He\r\nreally seems to have said farewell to the temptations of London. An\r\nexemplary swain!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it's going on all right, sir,\" said Andy.\r\n\r\nBelfield was a little puzzled at his lack of enthusiasm. Andy showed no\r\nactual signs of embarrassment, but his tone was cold, and his interest\r\nseemed perfunctory.\r\n\r\n\"I daresay you've been too busy to pay much attention to such frivolous\r\naffairs,\" he said; but to Andy's ears his voice sounded the least bit\r\nresentful.\r\n\r\n\"No; I--I assure you I take the keenest interest in it. I'd give\r\nanything to have it go all right.\"\r\n\r\nBelfield's eyes were on him with a shrewd kindness. \"No reason to\r\nsuppose it won't, is there?\"\r\n\r\n\"None that I know of.\" Now Andy was frowning a little and smoking rather\r\nfast.\r\n\r\nBelfield said no more. He could not cross-examine Andy; indeed he had no\r\nmaterials, even if he had the right. But Andy's manner left him with a\r\nfeeling of uneasiness.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, well, there's only six weeks to wait for the wedding!\"\r\n\r\nThe next Saturday found him again at Halton. One of the six weeks had\r\npassed; a week of happy work, yet somewhat shadowed by the recollection\r\nof Belfield's questions and his own poor answers. Had he halted midway\r\nbetween honest truth and useful lying? In fact he knew nothing of what\r\nhad been happening of late. He had not visited Nutley again--since that\r\nnight. Suddenly it struck him that he had not been invited. Then--did\r\nthey suspect? How could they have timed his entrance so exactly as to\r\nsuspect? He did not know that Harry had seen his retreating figure.\r\nStill it would seem to them possible that he might have seen--possible,\r\nif unlikely. That might be enough to make him a less desired guest.\r\n\r\nThe great campaign was to begin on the following Monday, though Andy\r\nwould not be at leisure to devote himself to it till a week later. The\r\ntalk ran on it. Wellgood, who seemed in excellent spirits, displayed\r\nkeen interest in the line Harry meant to take, and was ready to be\r\nchairman whenever desired. Even Mrs. Belfield herself showed some mild\r\nexcitement, and promised to attend one meeting. The girls were to go to\r\nas many as possible, Vivien being full of tremulous anticipation of\r\nHarry's triumph, Isobel almost as enthusiastic a partisan. She had met\r\nAndy with a perfection of composure which drove out of his head any idea\r\nthat she suspected him of secret knowledge.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid Harry's been overworking himself over it, poor boy,\" said\r\nMrs. Belfield. \"Don't you think he looks pale, Mr. Wellgood?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know where he's found the time to overwork,\" Wellgood answered,\r\nwith a gruff laugh. \"We can account for most of his time at Nutley.\"\r\n\r\nHarry burst into a laugh, and gulped down his wine. He was drinking a\r\ngood deal of champagne.\r\n\r\n\"I sigh as a lover, mother,\" he explained.\r\n\r\n\"That's what makes me pale--if I am pale.\" His tone turned to sudden\r\nirritation. \"Don't all look at me. There's nothing the matter.\" He\r\nlaughed again; he seemed full of changes of mood to-night. \"The speeches\r\nwon't give me much trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure you need have no other trouble, dear,\" said Mrs. Belfield,\r\nwith an affectionate glance at Vivien.\r\n\r\n\"He'll have much more trouble with me, won't he?\" Vivien laughed.\r\n\r\nAndy stole a look at Isobel. He was filled with admiration; a smile of\r\njust the right degree of sympathy ornamented her lips. A profane idea\r\nthat she must be in the habit of being kissed crossed his mind. It was\r\ndifficult to see how she could be, though--at Nutley. Kissing takes two.\r\nHe did not suspect Wellgood, and he was innocent himself.\r\n\r\nAnother eye was watching--shrewder and more experienced than\r\nAndy's--watching Harry, watching Isobel, watching while Andy stole his\r\nglance at Isobel. It was easy to keep bluff Wellgood in the dark; his\r\nown self-confidence hoodwinked him. Belfield was harder to blind; for\r\nthose who had anything to conceal, it was lucky that he did not live at\r\nNutley.\r\n\r\n\"Well, waiting for a wedding's tiresome work for all concerned, isn't\r\nit?\" he said to Isobel, who sat next him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, even waiting for other people's. It's such a provisional sort of\r\ntime, Mr. Belfield.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've forsworn one set of pleasures, and haven't got the other yet.\r\nYou've ceased to be a rover, and you haven't got a home.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't seem to consider being engaged a very joyful period?\" she\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n\"On the whole, I don't, Miss Vintry, though Vivien there looks pretty\r\nhappy. But it's telling on Harry, I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked across at Harry. \"Yes, I think it is a little,\" came\r\napparently as the result of a scrutiny suggested by Belfield's words. \"I\r\nhadn't noticed it, but I'm afraid you're right.\"\r\n\r\n\"If there's anything up, she's a cool hand,\" thought Belfield. \"You must\r\ntry to distract his thoughts,\" he told her.\r\n\r\n\"I try to let them see as little of me as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too complete a realization of matrimonial solitude _a deux_ before\r\nmarriage--Is that advisable?\"\r\n\r\n\"You put too difficult questions for a poor spinster to answer, Mr.\r\nBelfield.\"\r\n\r\nHe got nothing out of her, but from the corner of his eye he saw Harry\r\nwatching him as he talked to Isobel. Turning his head sharply, he met\r\nhis son's glance full and straight. Harry dropped his eyes suddenly, and\r\nagain drank off his champagne. Belfield looked sideways at the composed\r\nlady on his right, and pursed up his lips a little.\r\n\r\nWellgood stayed with him to-night after dinner, the young men joining\r\nthe ladies in the garden for coffee.\r\n\r\n\"Our friend Miss Vintry's in great good looks to-night, Wellgood.\r\nRemarkably handsome girl!\"\r\n\r\n\"That dress suits her very well. I thought so myself,\" Wellgood agreed,\r\nwell-pleased to have his secret choice thus endorsed.\r\n\r\nBelfield knew nothing of his secret, nothing of his plans. He was only\r\ntrying to find out whether Vivien's father were fully at his ease; of\r\nIsobel's lover and his ease he took no account.\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word,\" he laughed, \"if I were engaged, even to a girl as\r\ncharming as your Vivien, I should almost feel it an injury to have\r\nanother as attractive about all day. 'How happy could I be with\r\neither--!' you know. The unregenerate man in one would feel that good\r\nmaterial was being wasted; and my boy used to be rather unregenerate,\r\nI'm afraid.\"\r\n\r\nWellgood smiled in a satisfied fashion. \"Even if Master Harry was\r\ndisposed to play tricks, I don't think he'd get much encouragement\r\nfrom--\"\r\n\r\n\"'T'other dear charmer?' Of course you've perfect confidence in her, or\r\nshe wouldn't be where she is.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, nor where she's going to be,\" thought Wellgood, enjoying his\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\n\"My licentious fancy has wronged my son. I must have felt a touch of the\r\nold Adam myself, Wellgood. Don't tell my wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't tell me, if you knew a bit more,\" thought triumphant\r\nWellgood.\r\n\r\n\"I think Harry's constancy has stood a good trial. Oh, you'll think I\r\ndon't appreciate Vivien! I do; but I know Harry.\"\r\n\r\nWellgood answered him in kind, with a bludgeon-like wit. \"You'll think I\r\ndon't appreciate Harry. I do; but I know Miss Vintry, and she doesn't\r\ncare a button about him.\"\r\n\r\n\"We proud parents put one another in our places!\" laughed Belfield.\r\n\r\nWellgood saw no danger, and he had been home a fortnight! True, he had,\r\nbefore that, been away six weeks. But such mischief, if it existed,\r\nwould have grown. If it had been there during the six weeks, it would\r\nhave been there, in fuller growth, during the fortnight. Belfield felt\r\nreassured. He had found out what he wanted, and yet had given no hint to\r\nVivien's father. But one or two of his remarks abode in the mind of\r\nIsobel's lover, to whom he did not know that he was speaking. Wellgood's\r\nsecret position towards Isobel at once made Belfield's fears, if the\r\nfears were more than a humorous fancy, absurd, and made them, even\r\nthough no more than a fancy, stick. He recked nothing of them as a\r\nfather; he remembered them as a lover, yet remembered only to laugh in\r\nhis robust security. He thought it would be a good joke to tell to\r\nIsobel, not realizing that it is never a good joke to tell a woman that\r\nshe has been, without cause and ridiculously, considered a source of\r\ndanger to legitimate affections. She may feel this or that about the\r\ncharge; she will not feel its absurdity. She is generally right. Few\r\nwomen pass through the world without stirring in somebody once or twice\r\nan unruly impulse--a fact which should incline them all to\r\ncircumspection in themselves, and to charity towards one another, if\r\npossible, and at any rate towards us.\r\n\r\n\"And what,\" asked Belfield, with an air of turning to less important\r\nmatters, \"about the life of this Parliament?\"\r\n\r\nWellgood opined that it would prove much what a certain philosopher\r\ndeclared the life of man to be--nasty, short, and brutish.\r\n\r\nIn the garden Mrs. Belfield, carefully enfolded in rugs, dozed the doze\r\nof the placid. Isobel and Harry whispered across her unconscious form.\r\n\r\n\"You shouldn't drink so much champagne, Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hang it, I want it! I said nothing wrong, did I?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't keep control of your eyes. I think your father noticed. Why\r\nlook at me?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know I can't help it. And I can't stand it all much longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can end it as soon as you like. Am I preventing you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, Miss Vintry? I'm afraid I'm drowsy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was just saying I hoped I wasn't preventing Mr. Harry from strolling\r\nwith Vivien, Mrs. Belfield.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, my dear, of course!\" The placid lids fell over the placid eyes\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"End it? How?\"\r\n\r\n\"By behaving as Vivien's _fiance_ ought.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or by not being Vivien's _fiance_ any longer?\"\r\n\r\n\"What, Harry love? What's that about not being Vivien's _fiance_ any\r\nlonger?\" Mrs. Belfield was roused by words admitting of so startling an\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we shall be married soon, shan't we, mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"How stupid of me, Harry dear!\" Sleep again descended. Harry swore\r\nsoftly; Isobel laughed low.\r\n\r\n\"This is ridiculous!\" she remarked. \"Couldn't you take just one turn\r\nwith Vivien's companion? Your mother might hear straight just once.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be hanged if I chance it to-night,\" said Harry. \"I'll take\r\nWellgood on at billiards.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, go and do that; it's much better. It may bring back your colour,\r\nHarry.\"\r\n\r\nHarry looked at her in exasperation--and in longing. \"I wish there\r\nwasn't a woman in the world!\" he growled.\r\n\r\n\"It's men like you who say that,\" she retorted, smiling. \"Go and forget\r\nus for an hour.\"\r\n\r\nHe went without more words--with only such a shrug as he had given when\r\nhe said good-bye to Mrs. Freere. Isobel sat on, by dozing Mrs. Belfield,\r\nthe picture of a dutiful neglected companion, while Wellgood and Harry\r\nplayed billiards, and Belfield, wheezing over an unread evening paper,\r\nhonoured her with a tribute of distrustful curiosity. Left alone in the\r\nflesh, she could boast that she occupied several minds that evening.\r\nPerhaps she knew it, as she sat silent, thoughtfully gazing across to\r\nwhere Vivien and Andy sat together, their dim figures just visible in\r\nenshrouding darkness. \"He saw--but he won't speak!\" she was thinking.\r\n\r\n\"How funny of Harry to say he sighed as a lover!\" Vivien remarked to\r\nAndy.\r\n\r\nAndy had the pride and pleasure of informing her that her lover was\r\nindulging in a quotation from another lover, more famous and more\r\ntemperate.\r\n\r\n\"'I sighed as a lover. I obeyed as a son.' I see! How funny! Do you\r\nthink Gibbon was right, Mr. Hayes?\"\r\n\r\n\"The oldest question since men had sons and women had lovers, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't love come first--when once it has come?\"\r\n\r\n\"After honour, the poet tells us, Miss Wellgood.\"\r\n\r\nVivien knew that quotation, anyhow. \"It's beautiful, but isn't it--just\r\na little priggish?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we must admit that it's at least a very graceful apology,\"\r\nlaughed Andy.\r\n\r\nTheir pleasant banter bred intimacy; she was treating him as an old\r\nfriend. He felt himself hardly audacious in saying \"How you've grown!\"\r\n\r\nShe understood him--nay, thanked him with a smile and a flash, revealing\r\npleasure, from her eyes, often so reticent. \"Am I different from the\r\ndays of the lame pony and Curly? Not altogether, I'm afraid, but I hope\r\na little.\" She sat silent for a moment. \"I love Harry--well, so do you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I love Harry.\" But he had a sore grudge against Harry at that\r\nmoment. Who at Halton had once talked about pearls and swine? And in\r\nwhat connection?\r\n\r\n\"That's why I'm different.\" She laughed softly. \"If you'd so far\r\nhonoured me, Mr. Hayes, and I had--responded, I might never have become\r\ndifferent. I should just have relied on the--policeman.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Force is always ready to do its duty,\" said Andy.\r\n\r\n\"Take care; you're nearly flirting!\" she admonished him merrily; and\r\nAndy, rather proud of himself for a gallant remark, laughed and blushed\r\nin answer. She went on more seriously, yet still with her serene smile.\r\n\"First I've got to please him; then I've got to help him. He must have\r\nboth, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please him, oh, yes! Help him, how?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure you know. Poor boy! His ups and downs! Sometimes he comes to\r\nme almost in despair. It's so hard to help then. Isobel can't either.\r\nHe's not happy, you know, to-night.\"\r\n\r\nShe had grown. This penetration was new; should he wish that it might\r\nbecome less or greater? Less for the sake of her peace, or greater for\r\nher enlightenment's?\r\n\r\n\"It seems as if a darkness swept over him sometimes, and got between him\r\nand me.\" Her voice trembled a little. \"I want to keep that darkness away\r\nfrom him; so I mustn't be afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whether you're afraid or not, you won't run away. Remember Curly!\"\r\n\r\nShe turned to him with affectionate friendliness. \"But you'll be there\r\nin this too, so far as you can, won't you? Don't forsake me, will you?\r\nIt's sometimes--very difficult.\" Her face lit up in a smile again. \"I\r\nhope it'll make a man of me, as father used to say of that odious\r\nhunting.\"\r\n\r\nIt had, at least, made an end of the mere child in her. The discernment\r\nof her lover's trouble, the ignorance of whence it came, the need of\r\nfighting it--she faced these things as part of her work. Her engagement\r\nwas no more either amazement merely, or merely joy. She might still be\r\nafraid of dogs, or shrink from a butcher's shop. She knew a difficulty\r\nwhen she saw one, and for love's sake faced it. Andy thought it made the\r\nlove dearer to her; with an inward groan he saw that it did. For he was\r\nafraid. What she told of Harry told more than she could fathom for\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nAndy was a partisan. He cried whole-heartedly, \"The pity for Vivien!\" He\r\ncould say, \"The pity for Harry!\" for old Harry's sake, and more for\r\nVivien's. No, \"The pity for Isobel!\" was breathed in his heart. The case\r\nseemed to him a plain one there; and he was not of the party who would\r\nhave the Recording Angel as liberal with tears as with ink, sedulously\r\nobliterating everything that he punctiliously wrote--in the end, on that\r\nview, a somewhat ineffectual registrar, who might be spared both ink and\r\ntears, and provided with a retiring pension by triumphant believers in\r\nNecessity. It may come to that.\r\n\r\n\"I think Harry may be wanting me.\" She rose in her slim grace, and held\r\nout a hand to him--not in formal farewell, but in an impulse of\r\ngood-will. She had come into her heritage of womanhood, and bore it with\r\na shy stateliness. \"Thank you\"--a pause rather merry than timid--\"Thank\r\nyou, policeman Andy.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I thank you--and you seem to me rather like the queen of the\r\nfairies.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled, and sighed lightly. \"If I can make the king think so\r\nalways!\"\r\n\r\nThen she was gone, a white shadow gliding over the grass--a woman now,\r\nstill in a child's shape. She flitted past Isobel Vintry, kissing her\r\nhand, and so passed in to where \"Harry wanted her.\"\r\n\r\nPoliteness dictated that Andy, thus left to himself, should join his\r\nhostess; he did not know that she was asleep, quite sound asleep by now.\r\n\r\nHaving sat down before he discovered this state of affairs, he found\r\nhimself committed to a virtual _tete-a-tete_ with Isobel Vintry, quite\r\nthe last thing he desired. He did not find it easy to open the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we can talk! We shan't disturb her,\" Miss Vintry hastened to assure\r\nhim with a smile. \"You've been quite a stranger at Nutley. Did you find\r\nthe atmosphere too romantic? Too much love-making for your taste?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did feel rather in the way now and then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you were once or twice! When you attached yourself to Vivien\r\nafter dinner, and left Mr. Harry no resource but poor me!\"\r\n\r\nSurely if she spoke like that--actually recalling the critical\r\noccasion--she could have no suspicion? Either she must never have\r\nnoticed the shawl at all, or feel sure that it had been removed before\r\nher talk with Harry reached the point of danger.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure you entertained him very well. I don't think he'd complain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sometimes people like talking over their affairs with a third\r\nperson for a change--as I daresay Vivien has been doing with you just\r\nnow! And, after all, because you're engaged, everybody else in the world\r\nneedn't at once seem hopelessly stupid.\"\r\n\r\nCertainly Isobel Vintry could never seem hopelessly stupid, thought\r\nAndy. Rather she was superbly plausible.\r\n\r\n\"And perhaps even Mr. Harry may like a rest from devotion--or will you\r\nbe polite enough to suggest that a temporary change in its object is a\r\nbetter way of putting it?\"\r\n\r\nPrecisely what it had been in Andy's mind to suggest--but not exactly by\r\nway of politeness! It was disconcerting to have the sting drawn from his\r\nthoughts or his talk in this way.\r\n\r\n\"That might be polite to you--in one sense; it might sound rather unjust\r\nto Harry,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Am I the first person who has ever dared to make such an insinuation?\r\nHow shocking! But I've even dared to do it to Mr. Harry himself, and he\r\nhardly denied that he was an incorrigible flirt.\"\r\n\r\nAndy knew that he was no match for her. For any advantage he could ever\r\nwin from her, he must thank chance or surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be so terribly strict, Mr. Hayes. If you were engaged, would you\r\nlike every word--absolutely every word--you said to another girl to be\r\nrepeated to your _fiancee_?\"\r\n\r\nAndy, always honest, considered. \"Perhaps I shouldn't--and a few pretty\r\nspeeches hurt nobody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, really you're becoming quite human! You encourage me to confess\r\nthat Mr. Harry has made one or two to me--and I've not repeated them to\r\nVivien. I'm relieved to find you don't think me a terrible sinner.\"\r\n\r\nShe was skilfully pressing for an indication of what he knew, of how\r\nmuch he had seen--without letting him, if he did know too much, have a\r\nchance of confronting her openly with his knowledge. Must he be\r\nconsidered in the game she was playing, or could he safely be neglected?\r\n\r\nAndy's temper was rather tried. She talked of a few idle words, a few\r\npretty speeches--ordinary gallantries. His memory was of two figures\r\ntense with passion, and of a lover's kiss accepted as though by a\r\nwilling lover.\r\n\r\n\"How far would you carry the doctrine?\" he asked dryly.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause before she answered; she was shaping her reply so that\r\nit might produce the result she wanted--information, yet not\r\nconfrontation with his possible knowledge.\r\n\r\n\"As far as a respectful kiss?\" Peering through the darkness, she saw a\r\nquick movement of Andy's head. Instantly she added with a laugh, \"On the\r\nhand, I mean, of course!\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't ask me to go any further, if I admit that?\" asked Andy.\r\n\r\n\"No. I'll agree with you on that,\" she said.\r\n\r\nMrs. Belfield suddenly woke up. \"Yes, I'm sure Harry's looking pale,\"\r\nshe remarked.\r\n\r\nIsobel had got her information; she was sure now. The sudden movement of\r\nAndy's head had been too startled, too outraged, to have been elicited\r\nmerely by an audacious suggestion put forward in discussion; it spoke of\r\nmemories roused; it expressed wonder at shameless effrontery. Andy had\r\nrevealed his knowledge, but he did not know that he had. He had parted\r\nwith his secret; yet it had become no easier for him to meddle. If he\r\nhad thought himself bound to say nothing, not to interfere, before, he\r\nwould seem to himself so bound still. And if he tried to meddle, at\r\nleast she would be fighting now with her eyes open. There might be\r\ndanger--there could be no surprise.\r\n\r\nWhen Harry Belfield put on her cloak for her in the hall, she whispered\r\nto him: \"Take care of Andy Hayes! He did see us that first night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV.\r\n\r\nSAVING THE NATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a fine afternoon Jack Rock stood smoking his pipe on the pavement of\r\nHigh Street. His back was towards the road, his face turned to his own\r\nshop-window, where was displayed a poster of such handsome dimensions\r\nthat it covered nearly the whole of the plate glass, to the prejudice of\r\nJack's usual display of mutton and beef. He took no account of that; he\r\nwas surveying the intruding poster with enormous complacency. It\r\nannounced that there would be held, under the auspices of the Meriton\r\nConservative and Unionist Association, an open-air Public Meeting that\r\nevening on Fyfold Green. Chairman--The Rt. Hon. Lord Meriton (his\r\nlordship was rarely \"drawn;\" his name indicated a great occasion).\r\nSpeakers--William Foot, Esq., K. C., M. P. (very large letters); Henry\r\nBelfield, Esq., Prospective Candidate etc. (letters not quite so large);\r\nand Andrew Hayes, Esq. (letters decidedly smaller, but still easily\r\nlegible from across the street). Needless to say that it was the sight\r\nof the last name which caused Mr. Jack Rock's extreme complacency. He\r\nhad put up the stakes; now he was telling himself that the \"numbers\"\r\nwere up for the race. Andy was in good company--too good, of course, for\r\na colt like him on the present occasion; but in Jack's mind the race\r\ncomprised more than one meeting. There was plenty of time for the colt\r\nto train on! Meanwhile there he was, on a platform with Lord Meriton,\r\nwith Mr. Foot, King's Counsel, Member of Parliament (Jack's thoughts\r\nrehearsed these titles--the former of which Billy had recently\r\nachieved--at full length, for all the world like the toastmaster at a\r\npublic dinner), and Mr. Henry Belfield, Prospective Candidate etc. Mr.\r\nRock hurled at himself many contemptuous and opprobrious epithets when\r\nhe recollected the career which he had once offered for the grateful\r\nacceptance of Andrew Hayes, Esq. To him the poster was a first and\r\nsplendid dividend on the three thousand pounds which Miss Doris Flower\r\nhad so prettily extracted from his pocket. Here was his return; he\r\nwillingly left to Andy the mere pecuniary fruits of the investment.\r\n\r\nThus immensely gratified, Jack refused to own that he was surprised. The\r\nautumn campaign had now been in progress nearly three weeks, and,\r\nalthough Andy had not been heard before in Meriton, reports of his\r\ndoings had come in from outlying villages with which Jack had business\r\ndealings. Nay, Mr. Belfield of Halton himself, who had braved the\r\nevening air by going to one meeting to hear his son, found time to stop\r\nat the shop and tell Jack that he had been favourably impressed by Andy.\r\n\r\n\"No flowers of rhetoric, Jack,\" he said with twinkling eyes, \"such as my\r\nboy indulges in, but good sound sense--knows his facts. I shouldn't\r\nwonder if the labourers like that better. He knows what their bacon\r\ncosts 'em, and how many loaves a week go to a family of six, and so on.\r\nI heard one or two old fellows saying 'Aye, that's right!' half a dozen\r\ntimes while he was speaking. I wish our old friend at the grammar school\r\ncould have heard him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Belfield; the old gentleman would have been proud, wouldn't\r\nhe?\"\r\n\r\n\"And you've a right to be proud, Jack. I know what you've done for the\r\nlad.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a good lad, sir. He comes to supper with me every Sunday,\r\npunctual, when he's in Meriton.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've every reason to hope he'll do very well--a sensible steady\r\nfellow! It'd be a good thing if there were more like him.\"\r\n\r\nThen Chinks and the Bird had made an excursion on their bicycles to hear\r\nAndy, and brought back laudatory accounts--this though Chinks was\r\nsuspected of Radical leanings, which he was not allowed by his firm to\r\nobtrude. And old Cox had heard him and pronounced the verdict that,\r\nthough he might be no flyer like Mr. Harry, yet he had the makings of a\r\nhorse in him. \"Wants work, and can stand as much as you give him,\" said\r\nMr. Cox.\r\n\r\nImmersed in a contemplation of the placard and in the reflections it\r\nevoked, Mr. Rock stepped backwards into the road in order to get a new\r\nview of the relative size of the lettering. Thereby he nearly lost his\r\nlife, and made Andy present possessor of a tidy bit of money for which,\r\nin the natural course, he would have to wait many years. (This is\r\ntrenching on old Jack's darling secret.) The agitated hoot of a\r\nmotor-car sent him on a jump back to the pavement, just in time. The car\r\ncame to a standstill.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't come all this way on purpose to kill you, Mr. Rock!\"\r\n\r\nJack had turned round already, in order to swear at his all but\r\nmurderer, who might reasonably have pleaded contributory negligence.\r\nAngry words died away. A small figure, enveloped in a dust cloak,\r\nwrapped about the head with an infinite number of yards of soft fabric,\r\nsat alone in the back of the car. The driver yawned, surveying Meriton\r\nwith a scornful air, appearing neither disturbed by Mr. Rock's danger\r\nnor gratified by his escape.\r\n\r\n\"It's so convenient,\" the small figure proceeded to observe, \"when\r\npeople have their names written over their houses. Still I think I\r\nshould have known you without that. Andy has described you to me, you\r\nsee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's never--?\" The broadest smile spread on Jack Rock's face.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, it is! I always keep my word. I'm taking a holiday, and I\r\nthought I'd combine my visit to you with--\" She suddenly broke off her\r\nsentence, and gave a gurgle. Jack thought it a curiously pleasant sound.\r\n\"Why, there it is!\" the Nun gurgled, pointing a finger at the wonderful\r\nplacard in Jack's window.\r\n\r\n\"You're--you're Miss Flower?\" gasped Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes--but look at it! Those three boys! Billy, and Harry--and Andy!\r\nAndy! Well, of course, one knows they do do things, but somehow it's so\r\nhard to realise. I shall certainly stay for the meeting! Seymour, let me\r\nout!\"\r\n\r\nSeymour got down in a leisurely fashion, hiding a yawn with one hand and\r\na cigarette in the other. \"I suppose there isn't a hotel in this place,\r\nMiss Flower?\" he remarked. (Seymour always called the Nun \"Miss Flower,\"\r\nnever merely \"Miss.\")\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes; the Lion, Seymour. Excellent hotel, isn't it, Mr. Rock? Kept by\r\nMr. Dove, who's got a son named the Bird; and the Bird's got a friend\r\nnamed Chinks, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you do beat creation!\" cried Jack. \"How do you--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Secret sources of information!\" said the Nun gravely. \"Have I got to go\r\nto the Lion, Mr. Rock? Or--or what time do you have tea?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll have tea with me, miss?\" cried Jack.\r\n\r\n\"At what hour will you require the car, Miss Flower?\" asked Seymour.\r\n\r\n\"You're goin' to the meetin', miss? Tell the young chap to be round at\r\nsix, and mind he's punctual.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do as Mr. Rock says, Seymour,\" smiled the Nun. It was part of the day's\r\nfun to hear Seymour ordered about--and called a young chap!--by the\r\nbutcher of Meriton. But she could not get into the house without another\r\nlook at the poster. \"Billy, Harry--and Andy! I wonder if those boys\r\nreally imagine that what they say or think matters!\"\r\n\r\nMiss Flower was already a privileged person. Jack had no rebuke for her\r\nprofanity. She took his arm, saying,\r\n\r\n\"I want to see the shop. You wanted Andy to have the shop, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was an old fool. I--I meant it well, Miss Flower.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun squeezed his arm.\r\n\r\n\"Were these nice animals when they were alive, Mr. Rock?\"\r\n\r\n\"Prime uns, alive or dead!\" chuckled Jack. \"You come back to supper,\r\nafter the meetin', miss, and taste; but maybe you'll be goin' back to\r\nLondon, or takin' your supper at Halton?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I've promised to take Billy Foot back to town. Oh, but\r\ntea now, Mr. Rock!\"\r\n\r\nNot even the messenger boy whom she had sent enjoyed Jack Rock's tea\r\nmore than the Nun herself. For a girl of her inches, she ate immensely;\r\neven more heartily she praised. Jack could hardly eat at all, she was so\r\ndaintily wonderful, her being there at all so amazing. Seeking\r\nexplanation of the marvel, the simple affectionate old fellow could come\r\nonly on one. She must be very fond of Andy! She had written to plead for\r\nAndy; she came and had tea with the old butcher--because he had given\r\nAndy help. And now she was lauding Andy, telling him in her quiet way\r\nthat his lad was much thought of by her and her smart friends in London.\r\nJack had, of course, a very inadequate realisation of what \"smartness\"\r\nin London really meant--a view which some might have called both\r\ninadequate and charitable.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he's a fine lad, miss. I say, the girl as gets Andy'll be lucky!\"\r\n(That \"as\" always tripped Jack up in moments of thoughtlessness.)\r\n\r\nThe Nun deliberately disposed of a piece of plum cake and a sip of\r\ntea--the latter to wash the former down.\r\n\r\n\"I don't fall in love myself,\" she observed, in a tone decided yet\r\ntolerant--as though she had said, \"I don't take liqueurs myself--but if\r\nyou like to risk it!\"\r\n\r\n\"You miss the best thing in life, miss,\" Jack cried.\r\n\r\n\"And most of the worst too,\" added the Nun serenely.\r\n\r\n\"Don't say it, miss. It don't come well from your pretty lips.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I put you on your mettle? I meant to, of course, Mr. Rock.\"\r\n\r\nOld Jack slapped his thigh, laughing immensely. Now wasn't this\r\ngood--that she should be here, having tea, getting at him like that?\r\n\r\nIt was a happy conjuncture, for the Nun was hardly less well pleased.\r\nShe divided her life into two categories; one was \"the mill,\" the other\r\nwas \"fun.\" The mill included making a hundred and eighty pounds by\r\nsinging two silly songs eight times each every week, being much adored,\r\nand eating meals at that restaurant; \"fun\" meant anything rather\r\ndifferent. Having tea with Jack Rock, the Meriton butcher, was rather\r\ndifferent, and Miss Flower (as Seymour called her--almost the only\r\nperson who did) was enjoying herself.\r\n\r\n\"I should like to take a walk along the street before we go to the\r\nmeeting, Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jack,\" casually dropped, with no more than a distant twinkle, finished\r\nMr. Rock.\r\n\r\n\"Your letter was pretty good, but you, miss--!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm considered attractive on a postcard. It costs a penny,\" said the\r\nNun, rising, fully refreshed, from the table. \"Take me to the Lion,\r\nplease. I must see that Seymour isn't dissatisfied. He's a gentleman by\r\nbirth, you know, and a chauffeur by profession. So he rather alarms me,\r\nthough his manner is always carefully indifferent.\" This remark of hers\r\nsuddenly pleased the Nun. She gurgled; her own rare successes always\r\ngratified her--witness that somewhat stupid story about the two ladies\r\nand Tommy, told a long while ago.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by proud Jack Rock, she traversed Meriton High Street,\r\ngreatly admiring the church, the grammar school, and that ancient and\r\nrespectable hostelry, the Lion. Indeed she fell so much in love with the\r\nLion that she questioned Jack as to the accommodation it provided, and\r\nwas assured that it boasted a private sitting-room, with oak panelling\r\nand oak beams across the ceiling (always supposed to be irresistible\r\nattractions to London visitors), and bedrooms sufficient in case she and\r\nMiss Dutton should be minded to spend a part of their holiday there.\r\nRoom also for a maid--and for Seymour and the motor. \"It's rather a nice\r\nidea. I'll think it over,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThen it was time to think about the meeting; and Jack must come with her\r\nin the car, sit with her, and tell her all about it. \"Oh yes, you must!\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall never hear the last of it, long as I live!\" Jack protested,\r\nhalf in delight, half in a real shyness.\r\n\r\nBehold them, then, thus installed on the outskirts of the meeting, with\r\na good view of the platform where \"the boys\" were seated, together with\r\nWellgood, supporting the great Lord Meriton. Vivien and Isobel also had\r\nchairs at the back. The Nun produced a field-glass from a pocket in the\r\ncar, and favoured these ladies with a steady inspection. \"Which did you\r\nsay was Harry's?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"The fair one, miss--that's Miss Wellgood.\"\r\n\r\n\"The other's quite good-looking too,\" the Nun pronounced.\r\n\r\nThe salient features of Mr. Foot's oratory have been indicated on a\r\nprevious occasion. This evening he surpassed himself in epigram and\r\nlogic; no doubt he desired to overcome the Nun's obstinate scepticism as\r\nto his career, no less than to maintain his popularity in Meriton. For\r\nthe Nun he had a special treat--a surprise. He told them her story of\r\nTommy and the two ladies, slightly adapting it to the taste of a general\r\naudience; the cheques were softened down to invitations to _tete-a-tete_\r\ndinners, couched in highly affectionate language. In Billy's apologue\r\nthe Ministry was Tommy, one of the ladies was Liberalism, the other\r\nSocialism. The apologue took on very well; Billy made great play with\r\nTommy's double flirtation, and the Ministry's double flirtation, ending\r\nup, \"Yes, gentlemen, there will be only one tip to pay the waiter, but\r\nthat'll be a tip-over, if I'm not much mistaken!\" (Cheers and laughter.)\r\n\r\nThe Nun was smiling all over her face. \"That really was rather clever of\r\nBilly.\" She felt herself shining with reflected glory.\r\n\r\nBut Billy--astute electioneerer--meant to get more out of the Nun than\r\njust that Tommy story. When he had finished a wonderful peroration, in\r\nwhich he bade Meriton decide once and for all--it would probably never\r\nhave another chance before it was too late--between Imperial greatness\r\nand Imperial decay, he slipped from the platform, and made his way round\r\nthe skirts of the meeting to her motor-car. Lord Meriton's compliments,\r\nand would Miss Flower oblige him and delight the meeting by singing the\r\nNational Anthem at the close of the proceedings? The Nun was so agitated\r\nby this request that she lost most of Andy's speech; he was sandwiched\r\nin between the more famous orators. As Andy--from what she did\r\nhear--appeared to be talking about loaves, and sugar, and bacon, and\r\nthings of that sort, she was of opinion that she was not missing very\r\nmuch, and was surprised to see the men listening and the bareheaded\r\nwomen nodding approvingly and nudging one another in the ribs. \"He's\r\njolly good! Upon my word, he is,\" said Billy Foot suddenly, and old Jack\r\nchuckled delightedly. When Andy sat down, without any peroration, she\r\nsaid to Billy, \"Was he good? It sounded rather dull to me. Yours was\r\nfine, Billy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Awfully glad you liked it. But they'll forget my jokes; they'll talk\r\nabout old Andy's figures when they get home. Every woman in the place'll\r\nwant to prove 'em right or wrong. Gad, how he must have mugged all that\r\nup!\"\r\n\r\nThen came Harry; to him she listened, at him she looked. Whatever the\r\ndifficulties of his private life might be, they did not avail to spoil\r\nhis speaking; it is conceivable that they improved it, since nerves on\r\nthe strain sometimes result in brilliant flashes. And he looked so\r\nhandsome, with pale, eager, excited face. He could fall in love with a\r\nsubject almost as deeply, almost as quickly, as with a woman, and for\r\nthe moment be hardly less devoted to it, heart and soul. Perhaps he was\r\na little over the heads of most of his audience, but they knew that it\r\nwas a fine performance and were willing to take for granted some things\r\nwhich they did not understand.\r\n\r\n\"That's talking, that is!\" said a man near the car. \"Mr. Harry's the one\r\nto give ye that.\"\r\n\r\nOf course the Nun was persuaded in the matter of the National Anthem.\r\nBilly led her round to the platform, where Lord Meriton welcomed her,\r\nand introduced her to the meeting as Miss Doris Flower, the famous\r\nLondon singer, who had kindly consented to sing the National Anthem. For\r\nonce in her life the Nun was very nervous, but she sang. Her sweet voice\r\nand her remarkable prettiness stormed the meeting. They would have\r\nanother song. The applause brought back her confidence. Before she had\r\nbecome a nun or a Quaker she had once been, in early days, a Cameron\r\nHighlander. A couple of martial and patriotic ditties remained in her\r\nmemory; she gave them one, and excited enthusiasm. They cried for\r\nmore--more! An encore was insisted upon. In spite of the brilliant\r\nspeakers, the Nun was the heroine of the evening. She bowed, she smiled,\r\nshe fell altogether in love with Meriton. Thoughts of the Lion rose\r\nstrongly in her mind.\r\n\r\n\"A great success, and we owe a great deal of it to you, Miss Flower,\"\r\nsaid the noble chairman. \"You just put the crown on it all. I wish we\r\ncould have you here at election time!\"\r\n\r\nThe whole platform besought the Nun to come down at election time with\r\nmore patriotic songs. Most urgent was the pretty, slight, fair girl who\r\nwas Harry Belfield's _fiancee_. Her eyes were so friendly and gentle\r\nthat the Nun could refuse her nothing.\r\n\r\n\"At one bound, Doris, you've become a personage in Meriton,\" laughed\r\nBilly Foot.\r\n\r\n\"She's a personage wherever she goes,\" said Andy in frank and\r\naffectionate admiration.\r\n\r\nThe Nun gurgled happily. But where was her old friend Harry with his\r\ncongratulations? He had greeted her, but not with much enthusiasm; he\r\nwas now talking to the other girl--Miss Vintry--in a low voice, with a\r\nfrown on his face; he looked weary and spent. She moved over to him and\r\nlaid her hand on his arm; he started violently.\r\n\r\n\"I'll never laugh at you about your speeches again, Harry. But, poor old\r\nfellow, how done up you look!\"\r\n\r\n\"Doing this sort of thing every night's pretty tiring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides all the other things you have to do just now! I think I must\r\ncome and stay at the Lion and look after you.\"\r\n\r\nHarry looked at her with an expression that puzzled her; it almost\r\nseemed like resentment, though the idea was surely absurd. Miss Vintry\r\nsaid nothing; she stood by in silent composure.\r\n\r\n\"You're thinking of--of coming to Meriton?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had an idea of it, for a week or two. I'm doing nothing, you know.\r\nSally would come with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think you'd find it awfully dull,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\nThe Nun could not make him out. Was he ashamed of her? Did he not want\r\nher to know Miss Wellgood, his _fiancee_? It almost looked like that.\r\nThe Nun was a little hurt. She was aware that certain people held\r\ncertain views; but Harry was an old, old friend. \"Well, if I do come and\r\nfind it dull, you needn't feel responsible. You haven't pressed me, have\r\nyou?\" and with a little laugh she went back to more expansive friends.\r\n\r\n\"That'd make another of them, and she's infernally sharp!\" Harry said to\r\nIsobel Vintry, in that low careful voice to which he was nowadays so\r\nmuch addicted.\r\n\r\n\"Oh well, we can't keep it up this way long anyhow,\" she answered, and\r\nsauntered off to join Vivien.\r\n\r\nWith Billy, with Andy, as with old Jack, the Nun found enthusiasm enough\r\nand to spare.\r\n\r\n\"How perfectly ripping an idea!\" cried Billy. \"Because Harry's governor\r\nhad asked me to stay a fortnight at Halton, and do half a dozen more\r\nmeetings; and I'm going to. And Andy'll be down here too. Why, we shall\r\nall be together! You come, Doris!\"\r\n\r\nHer hurt feelings found expression. \"Harry didn't seem to want me when I\r\nspoke to him about it.\"\r\n\r\nBilly Foot looked at her curiously. \"Oh, didn't he?\" Andy had moved off\r\nwith Jack Rock. \"It's a funny thing, but I don't think he wants me at\r\nHalton. He was far from enthusiastic. If you ask me, Doris, there's\r\nsomething wrong with him. Overworked, I suppose. Oh, but he can't be;\r\nthese little meetings are no trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I want to come, I shall. Only one doesn't like the idea that one's\r\nfriends are ashamed--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, rot, it can't be that! That's not a bit like Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's engaged now, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I can't see why that should make any difference. He's got the\r\nblues over something or other; never mind him. You come, you and Sally.\"\r\n\r\nShe lowered her voice. \"Can it be because of poor old Sally?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't think so. He's always been awfully kind about that wretched\r\nold business.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's something,\" she persisted with a vexed frown.\r\n\r\nVivien Wellgood came up to them with Andy. \"Mr. Hayes tells me you may\r\npossibly come to Meriton for a stay, Miss Flower. I do hope you will.\r\nThe Lion's quite good, and we'll all do all we can to amuse you, if only\r\nyou'll sing to us just now and then. Do say you'll come; don't only\r\nthink about it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your being so kind makes me want to come more,\" said the Nun. \"Oh, and\r\nI do congratulate you, Miss Wellgood. I hope you'll be ever so happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. I hope so,\" said Vivien softly, her eyes assuming their\r\nveiled look.\r\n\r\nThe car was waiting; Seymour was yawning and looking at his watch. The\r\nNun said her farewells, but not one to Harry Belfield, who had already\r\nstrolled off along the road. Not very polite of Harry!\r\n\r\n\"Did you like the speeches, Seymour?\" she inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Foot, of course, is a good speaker. The other gentlemen did very\r\nwell for such a meeting as this, Miss Flower. Mr. Belfield is very\r\npromising.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was I in good voice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very fair. But you had better not use it much in the open air. Not good\r\nfor the chords, Miss Flower.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he had skilfully tucked her in with Billy Foot, and off they\r\nwent, Billy comforting himself after his labours with a pull at his\r\nflask and a very big cigar.\r\n\r\n\"I've made you do some work for the good cause to-night, Doris,\" he\r\nremarked. \"A song or two goes jolly well at a meeting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thinking of enlisting me in your own service?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"You'd be uncommon valuable. The man they're putting up against me has\r\ngot a pretty wife.\" Billy allowed himself a glance; it met with\r\ninadequate appreciation.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'll come and sing for you if you ask me, Billy.\" Her voice sounded\r\nabsent. She was enjoying the motion and the air, but her thoughts were\r\nwith Vivien Wellgood, the girl who had been so kind, and whose eyes had\r\ngone blank when the Nun wished her happiness.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Harry's off colour,\" said Billy, puffing away with much enjoyment.\r\n\"He can't take anything right; didn't even like your story!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you brought it in so cleverly, Billy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Harry asked me what I thought they'd make of that kind of rot. It\r\nseemed to me they took it all right. Rather liked it, didn't they?\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun turned to him suddenly. \"That girl isn't happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's something up!\" Billy concluded.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know that Miss Vintry well?\"\r\n\r\nBilly took his cigar out of his mouth and looked at her. \"You do jump to\r\nconclusions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know Harry better than any of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you?\" he asked, seeming just a little disturbed.\r\n\r\nThe Nun marked his disturbance with a side glance of amusement, but she\r\nwas not diverted from the main line of her thoughts. \"He doesn't want me\r\nto come to Meriton--\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Doris, did Harry Belfield ever try to--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tales out of school? I thought you knew me, Billy.\"\r\n\r\nThe reproach carried home to Billy. There had been one occasion when,\r\nover-night, his career had seemed not so imperative, and Doris had\r\nseemed very imperative indeed, demanding vows and protestations of high\r\nfervour, bearing only one legitimate interpretation. This happened long\r\nbefore Billy was K.C. or M.P., and when his income was still meagre. The\r\nmorning had brought back counsel, and thoughts of the career. Billy had\r\nwritten a letter. The next time they met, she had taken occasion to\r\nobserve that she always burnt letters, just as she never fell in love.\r\nThe episode was not among Billy's proudest recollections. In telling\r\nAndy that Billy had always pulled himself up on the brink, the Nun had\r\nbeen guilty of just this one suppression. No tales out of school was\r\nalways her motto.\r\n\r\n\"If he does come to grief, it'll be over a woman,\" said Billy. He took a\r\nbig puff. \"That's the only thing worth coming to grief over, either,\" he\r\nadded, looking into his companion's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"What about the great cause I sang for?\" she asked, serenely evasive.\r\nSentiment in a motor-car at night really does not count.\r\n\r\nBilly laughed. \"I do my best for my client.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you believe it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Honestly, I believe we've got, say, seven points out of ten. So we\r\nought to get the verdict.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that's honest enough. You leave the other side to put their\r\nthree points?\"\r\n\r\n\"That oughtn't to be over-straining them,\" Billy opined.\r\n\r\n\"Politics are rather curious. I might go to another meeting or two while\r\nI'm at Meriton; but I won't sing out of doors any more. Seymour doesn't\r\napprove of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're really going to take rooms there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if Sally consents.\" She turned round to him. \"Do you know what it\r\nis to see somebody asking for help?\"\r\n\r\n\"To me they always call it temporary assistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Well, I think I saw that to-night.\" She was silent a minute, then\r\nshe gurgled. \"And really they're all great fun, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I look forward to our stay at Meriton with the gravest apprehension,\"\r\nsaid Billy Foot.\r\n\r\nThe Nun looked at him, smiled, looked away, looked back once more.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I shall have nothing else to do--in the way of recreation,\" she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nA long silence followed. Billy threw away the stump of his cigar.\r\n\r\n\"Hang it, he's got the style, that fellow has!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's got what style?\" asked the Nun. Her voice sounded drowsy.\r\n\r\n\"What the House likes--Andy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What house?\" drawled the Nun, terribly and happily sleepy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you're a lively girl to drive home with in a motor at night!\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes were closed, her lips ever so little parted. Half asleep, still\r\nshe smiled. He made a trumpet of his hands and shouted into her ear.\r\n\"The House of Commons, stupid!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't tickle my ear,\" said the Nun. \"And try if you can't be quiet!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV.\r\n\r\nLOVE AND FEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell might Harry Belfield be subject to fits of temper and impatience!\r\nWell might he show signs of wear and tear not to be accounted for by the\r\nlabours of a mild political campaign, carried on under circumstances of\r\ngreat amenity! He had fallen into a state of feeling which forbade peace\r\nwithin, and made security from without impossible. He was terribly at\r\nwar in his soul. If he could have put the case so simply as that, being\r\npledged to one girl, he had fallen in love with another, he would have\r\nhad a plain solution open to him: he could break the engagement, facing\r\nthe pain that he gave and the discredit that he suffered. His feelings\r\nadmitted of no such straightforward remedy. The beliefs and the\r\naspirations with which he had wooed Vivien were not dead; they were\r\nstruggling for life against their old and mighty enemy. For him Vivien\r\nstill meant happiness, and more than happiness--a haven for anything\r\nthat was good in him, a refuge from all that was bad. With all his\r\ninstincts of pure affection, of loyalty and chivalry, still he loved her\r\nand clung to her. She it was still who had power to comfort and soothe\r\nhim, to send him forth able to do his work again. She was the best thing\r\nin his life; she seemed to him well-nigh his only chance against\r\nhimself. Was he to throw the last chance away?\r\n\r\nThen why not be true? Why deceive when he loved? Every day, nay, every\r\nhour, that question had to be asked in scorn and answered in bitterness.\r\nHis happiness lay with one; the present desire of his eyes was for\r\nanother. His mind towards Isobel was strange: often he hardly liked her;\r\nsometimes his hatred for what she was doing to his life made him almost\r\nhate her; always his passion for her was strong and compelling. Since\r\nthe stolen kiss had set it aflame, it had spread and spread through him,\r\nfed by their secret interviews, till it seemed now to consume all his\r\nbeing in one fierce blaze. How could affectionate and loyal instincts\r\nstand against it? Yet he hated it. All the good of his nature his\r\nkindliness, his amiability, his chivalry--hated it. He was become as it\r\nwere two men; and the one reviled the other. But when he reviled the\r\npassion in him as the murderer of all his happiness, it answered with a\r\nfell insinuation. Why these heroics and this despair? Why talk of\r\nhappiness being murdered? There was another way. \"Don't murder happiness\r\nfor me,\" passion urged slyly. \"I am violent, but I am a passing thing.\r\nYou know how often I have come to you, and raged, and passed by. There's\r\nanother way.\" That whisper was ever in his ears, and would not be\r\nsilenced. That it might gain its end, his passion subtly minimized\r\nitself; it sought to enter into an unnatural alliance with his better\r\npart; it prayed in aid his purer love, his tottering loyalty, his\r\nold-time chivalry. A permanent reconciliation with these it could not,\r\nand dared not, ask; but a _modus vivendi_ till it, transitory thing as\r\nit was, should pass away? So the tempter tempted with all his cunning.\r\n\r\nAvoiding plain words for what that way was, he was seduced into asking\r\nwhether it were open. He could not answer. Through all the stolen\r\ninterviews, through other stolen kisses, he had never come to the\r\nknowledge of Isobel's heart and mind. He could read no more than she\r\nchose to let him read. She allowed his flirtation and his kisses, but\r\nalmost scornfully. When he declared his state to be intolerable, she\r\ntold him it was easy to end it--easy to end either the engagement or the\r\nflirtation at his option. She had not owned to love. A certain sour\r\namusement seemed to lie for her in the affair. \"We're a pair of fools,\"\r\nher eyes seemed to say when he embraced her, \"but it doesn't much\r\nmatter; nothing can come of it, and it'll soon be all over.\" When he saw\r\nthat look, his old desire for conquest came over him; he was impelled at\r\nany cost to break down this indifference, to make his sway complete. Of\r\nher relations towards Wellgood she had flatly refused to say another\r\nword. \"The less we talk about that just now the better.\" In some such\r\nphrase she always forbade the topic. There again he was left in an\r\nuncertainty which stung his pride and bred a fierce jealousy. By what\r\nshe gave and what she withheld, by her silence no less than by her\r\nwords, she inflamed his passion. She yielded enough to fill him with\r\ndesire and hope of a full triumph; but even though she yielded, though\r\nher voice might falter and her eyes drop, she did not own love's mastery\r\nyet.\r\n\r\nThus torn and rent within, from without he seemed ringed round with\r\nenemies. Eyes that must needs be watchful were all about him. There was\r\nAndy Hayes with his chance knowledge of the first false step; Wellgood,\r\nwho must have a jealous vigilance for the woman whom he had at least\r\nthought of making his wife; his own father, with his shrewd estimate of\r\nhis son and acquaintance with past histories; Vivien herself, to whom he\r\nmust still play devoted lover, with whom most spare hours must still be\r\nspent. To add to all these, now there came this girl from London! She\r\nhad knowledge of past histories too; she had the sharpest of eyes; he\r\nfeared even the directness of her tongue. Andy had seen, but not spoken;\r\nhe did not trust Doris, if she saw, not to speak. He was terribly afraid\r\nof her. Small wonder that the suggestion of her stay at the Lion had\r\ncalled forth no enthusiasm from him! She took rank as an enemy the more.\r\nAnd Billy Foot was to be at Halton! She and Billy would lay their heads\r\ntogether and talk. Out of talk would come suspicion, out of suspicion\r\nmore watchfulness. It was no business of theirs, but they would watch.\r\n\r\nPolitical campaigning amidst all this! Well, in part it was a relief.\r\nThe speeches and their preparation perforce occupied his mind for the\r\ntime; on his platforms he forgot. Yet to go away--to leave Nutley for so\r\nmany hours--seemed to his overwrought fancy a sore danger. What might\r\nhappen while he was away? To what state of things might he any evening\r\ncome back? Vivien might have revealed suspicions to Wellgood, or\r\nWellgood might have challenged Isobel and compelled an answer. Once when\r\nAndy did not come to the meeting, he made sure that he had stayed behind\r\non purpose to reveal his knowledge to Vivien or her father, and the\r\nevening was a long torture which no speeches could deaden, no applause\r\nallay.\r\n\r\nIn this fever of conflict and of fear his days passed. At this cost he\r\nbought the joy of the stolen interviews--that joy so mixed with doubt,\r\nso tainted by pain, so assailed by remorse. Yet for him so tense, so\r\nkeen, so surcharged with the great primitive struggle. Ten minutes\r\nstolen once a day--it seldom came to more than that. Now and then, when\r\nhe had no political excursion, a second ten, late at night, after his\r\nostensible departure from Nutley. When he had \"gone home,\" when Vivien\r\nhad been sent to bed, and Wellgood had repaired to his pipe in the\r\nstudy, Isobel would chance to wander down the drive, looking into the\r\nwaters of the lake, and he, lingering by the gate, see her and come\r\nback. Whether she would saunter out or not he never knew. Waiting to see\r\nwhether she would seemed waiting for the fate of a lifetime.\r\n\r\nOne night--a week after the Fyfold Green meeting, a day after the Nun\r\nhad taken possession of her quarters at the Lion--Harry had dined at\r\nNutley and--gone home.\r\n\r\nIsobel stole stealthily out; she had a quarter of an hour before doors\r\nwould be locked. She strolled down the drive, a long dark cloak hiding\r\nthe white dress which would have shown too conspicuously. As she went\r\nshe dropped a letter; coming back she would pick it up. If any one asked\r\nwhy she had come out, the answer was--to find that letter, accidentally\r\ndropped. There had never been need of the excuse yet; it was still\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nHarry came swiftly, yet warily, back from the gate. For a fleeting\r\ninstant all his being seemed satisfied. But she stretched out her arms,\r\nholding him off.\r\n\r\n\"No, I want to say something, Harry. This--this has gone on long enough.\r\nTo-morrow I want you to know--only Miss Vintry!\" There was the break in\r\nher voice; it was too dark to see her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"That's impossible,\" he answered, very low.\r\n\r\n\"Everything else is impossible, you mean.\" Her voice faltered\r\nagain--into a tenderness new to him, filling him with rapture. \"You're\r\ndying of it, poor boy! End it, Harry! I watched you to-night. Oh, you're\r\ntired to death--do you ever sleep? End it, Harry--because I can't.\"\r\n\r\nSo she had broken at last, her long fencing ended, her strong composure\r\ngone. \"I can't bear it for you any longer. Have the strength. Go back\r\nto--\" She broke into tremulous laughter. \"Go back to duty, Harry--and\r\nforget this nonsense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come to me, Isobel!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I daren't. From to-morrow there is--nothing.\"\r\n\r\nHe caught the arms that would have defended her face. \"You love me?\"\r\n\r\nHer smile was piteous. \"Not after to-night!\"\r\n\r\nHis triumph rose on the crest of passion. \"Ah, you do!\" He kissed her.\r\n\r\n\"That's good-bye,\" she said. \"I shall go through it all right, Harry.\r\nYou'll see no signs. Or would you rather I went away?\"\r\n\r\n\"What made you tell me you loved me to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"So many things are tormenting you, poor boy! Must I go on doing it? Oh,\r\nI have done it, I know. It was my self-defence. Now my self-defence must\r\nbe forgetfulness.\" The clock over the stables struck a quarter past ten.\r\n\"I must go back. I've told you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you see Wellgood before you go to bed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, always.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happens?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't, don't, Harry! What does it matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to marry him?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're going to marry Vivien! I must go--or the door will be locked.\" A\r\nsmile wavered at him in the darkness. \"It's back to the house or into\r\nthe lake!\"\r\n\r\n\"Swear you'll manage to see me to-morrow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, anything. And--good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nHe let her go--without another kiss. His mind was all of a whirl. She\r\nsped swiftly up the avenue. He made for the gate with furtive haste.\r\n\r\nIsobel came to a stop. As the shawl had gone once, the letter had gone.\r\nWhither? Had the wind taken it? She had heard no tread, but what could\r\nshe have heard save the beating of her own heart? No use looking for it.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, miss,\" said the butler, who had just come to lock up, \"so you'd\r\nmissed it? I saw it blowing about, and went and picked it up. And you've\r\nbeen searching for it, miss?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Fellowes. Thanks. I must have dropped it this afternoon.\r\nGood-night.\"\r\n\r\nShe went in; the hall door was bolted behind her. The letter had served\r\nits purpose, but she was hardly awake to the fact that anything had\r\nhappened about the letter. She had told Harry! The great secret was out.\r\nOh, such bad tactics! Such a dangerous thing to do! But everybody had a\r\nbreaking-point. Hers had been reached that night--for herself as well as\r\nfor his sake. Nobody could live like this any longer.\r\n\r\nNow it was good-night to Wellgood; another ten minutes there--the one\r\nbrief space of time in which he played the lover, masterfully, roughly,\r\nsecure from interruption.\r\n\r\n\"I can't do it to-night!\" she groaned, leaning against the wall of the\r\npassage between drawing-room and study, as though stricken by a failure\r\nof the heart.\r\n\r\nThere she rested for minutes. The lights were left for Wellgood to find\r\nhis way by when he went to bed; Fellowes would not come to put them out.\r\nAnd there the truth came to her. She could not play that deep-laid game.\r\nShe could no more try for Harry, and yet keep Wellgood in reserve. It\r\nwas too hard, too hideous, too unnatural. She dared not try any more for\r\nHarry; she had lost confidence in herself. She could not keep\r\nWellgood--it was too odious. Then what to do? To tell Wellgood, too,\r\nthat from to-morrow there was only Miss Vintry? Yes! And to try to tell\r\nHarry so again to-morrow? Yes!\r\n\r\nShe had sought to make puppets and to pull the strings. Vivien,\r\nWellgood, Harry--all the puppets of her cool, clever, contriving brain.\r\nIt had been a fine scheme, bound to end well for her. Now she was\r\nrevealed as a puppet herself; she danced to the string. The great scheme\r\nbroke down--because Harry had looked tired and worried, because\r\nWellgood's rough fondness had grown so odious.\r\n\r\n\"I won't go to him to-night. He can't follow me if I go straight\r\nupstairs.\" The thought came as an inspiration; at least it offered a\r\nreprieve till to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThe study door opened, and Wellgood looked out. Isobel was behind her\r\ntime; he was waiting for his secret ten minutes, his stolen interview.\r\n\r\n\"Isobel! What the deuce are you doing there? Why didn't you come in?\"\r\n\r\nThe part she had been trying to play, and had backed herself to play,\r\nseemed to have become this evening, of a sudden on this evening, more\r\nthan hopeless. It had turned ridiculous; it must have been caught from\r\nsome melodrama. She had been playing the scheming dazzling villain of a\r\nwoman, heartless, with never a feeling, intent only on the title, or the\r\nmoney, or the diamonds, or whatever it might be, single in purpose,\r\ndesperate in action, glitteringly hard, glitteringly fearless. What\r\nnonsense! How away from human nature! She was now terribly afraid.\r\nPlaying that part, which seemed now so ridiculous because it assumed\r\nthat there was no real woman in her, she had brought herself into a\r\nperilous pass--between one man's love and another man's wrath. She knew\r\nwhich she feared the more; but she feared both. Somehow her confession\r\nto Harry had taken all the courage out of her. She felt as if she could\r\nnot stand any more by herself. She wanted Harry.\r\n\r\nShe could not tell Wellgood that henceforth there was to be only his\r\ndaughter's companion, only Miss Vintry; she could not tell him that\r\nto-night. Neither could she play the old part to-night--suffer his\r\nfondness, and defend herself with the shining weapons of her wit and her\r\nprovocative parries.\r\n\r\n\"I--I think I turned faint. I was coming in, but I turned faint. My\r\nheart, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never heard of anything being the matter with your heart.\" His voice\r\nsounded impatient rather than solicitous.\r\n\r\n\"Please let me go straight to bed to-night. I'm really not well.\"\r\n\r\nHe came along the passage to her. He took her by the shoulders and\r\nlooked hard in her face. Now she summoned her old courage to its last\r\nstand and met his gaze steadily.\r\n\r\n\"You look all right,\" he said with a sneer, yet smiling at her\r\nhandsomeness.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, of course, yes! At least I shall be to-morrow morning. Let me go\r\nnow.\" Really, at the moment, to be let go was her only desire.\r\n\r\n\"Be off with you, then,\" he said, smartly tapping--almost slapping--her\r\ncheek. \"But you'll have to give me twice as long to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned on his heel. With a smarting cheek she fled down the passage.\r\n\r\nThough disappointed of his ten minutes, Wellgood was on the whole not\r\nill-pleased. The calm composure, the suppression of emotion which he\r\nadmired so much in theory--and as exhibited in Vivien's companion--he\r\nhad begun to find a little overdone for his taste in his own lover.\r\nTo-night there was a softness about her, a gentleness--signs of fear.\r\nThe signs of fear were welcome to his nature. He felt that he had taken\r\na step towards asserting his proper position, and she one towards\r\nacknowledging it. He was also more than ever sure that he need pay no\r\nheed to Belfield's silly hints. The old fellow seemed to assume that his\r\nprecious son was irresistible! Wellgood chuckled over that. He chuckled\r\nagain over the thought that, if Isobel were going to be like this, they\r\nmight have a difficulty in keeping their secret till the proper time.\r\n\r\nIsobel's confession to Harry was a confession to herself also. If it\r\nleft her with one great excuse, it stripped her of all others. She could\r\nno longer say that she was making her woman's protest against being\r\nreckoned of no account, or that she was merely punishing Harry for\r\ndaring to think that he could play with her and come off scathless\r\nhimself. Even the great excuse found its force impaired, because she had\r\nbrought her state upon herself. Led by those impulses of pride or of\r\nspite, she had set herself to tamper with Vivien's happiness; in the\r\nattempt she had fatally involved her own.\r\n\r\nSome of her old courage--her old hardness--remained, not altogether\r\nswept away by the new current. \"I shall get over it in time,\" she told\r\nherself impatiently. \"These things don't last a lifetime.\" True,\r\nperhaps! But meanwhile--the time before the wedding? To-morrow, when she\r\nhad promised to meet Harry? Every day after that--when he must come to\r\nwoo Vivien? There had been protection for her in pretences. Pretences\r\nwere over with Harry; they had to go on with Vivien and with Wellgood.\r\nOn both sides of her position she felt herself now in a sore peril; it\r\nhad become so much harder to blind the others, so infinitely harder to\r\nhold Harry back, if it were his mind to advance. Tasks like these\r\nperhaps needed the zest of pride and spite to make them possible--to\r\nmake them tolerable anyhow. She loathed them now.\r\n\r\nNext day she kept her room. Courage failed. Wellgood grumbled about\r\nwomen's vapours, but in his caution asked no questions and showed no\r\nconcern. Harry, coming in the afternoon, in his caution risked no more\r\nthan a polite inquiry and a polite expression of regret. Yet he had come\r\nhot of heart, resolved--resolved on what? To break his engagement? No,\r\nhe was not resolved on that. To know in future only Vivien's companion,\r\nMiss Vintry? No. He had been resolved on nothing, save to see Isobel\r\nagain, and to hear once more her love. To what lay beyond he was blind;\r\nhis heart was obstinately set on the one desire, and had eyes for\r\nnothing else. But Isobel was not to be seen; he accused her of her old\r\ntactics--making advances, then drawing back. The whole thing had begun\r\nthat way; she was at it again! Was he never to feel quite sure of her?\r\nShe paid the price of past cunning, she who now lay in simple fear.\r\n\r\nVivien watched her lover's pale face and fretful gestures. Harry seemed\r\nalways on a strain now, and the means he adopted to relieve it would not\r\nbe permanently beneficial to his nerves; whisky-and-soda and cigarettes\r\nin quick succession were his prescription this afternoon. In vain she\r\ntried to soothe him, as she still sometimes could. He was now merry, now\r\nmoody, often amusing, gay, gallant. He was everything except the\r\ncontented man he had been in the early days.\r\n\r\n\"The dear old Rector's a little tiresome, Harry, isn't he? He won't fix\r\nthe date of his return within a week. And I couldn't be married by\r\nanybody else, he'd be so hurt. Naturally he doesn't think a few days one\r\nway or the other matter. He doesn't think of my frocks!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor of my feelings either,\" said Harry, gallantly kissing her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mind very much?\" she asked shyly.\r\n\r\n\"I'll do anything you like about it.\" He caressed her hand gently,\r\nkindly. He had at least the grace to feel shame for himself, pity for\r\nher--when he was with her.\r\n\r\n\"Harry, are you quite--quite happy?\"\r\n\r\nHe made his effort. \"I should be as happy as the day's long if it\r\nweren't for those wretched meetings that take up half my time.\" His\r\nvoice grew fretful. \"And they worry me to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll soon be over now, and then we can have all the time to\r\nourselves together.\" She looked at him with a smile. \"If only you won't\r\nget tired of that!\"\r\n\r\nHe made his protest. Suddenly a memory of other protests swept over\r\nhim--of how they had begun by being wholehearted and vehement, and had\r\nsunk first to weakness, then to insincerity, at last to silence. He\r\nhoped his present protest sounded all right.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you needn't be too vehement!\" she laughed, with a little shake of\r\nher head. \"I know myself, and I believe I know more about you than you\r\nthink. I'm quite aware that you'll sometimes be bored with me, Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's put that idea in your head?\" he asked rather sharply. His mind\r\nwas on those enemies, that ring of watching eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody except yourself--who else should?\" she asked in surprise. \"After\r\nall I've seen of you, I ought to know that you have your moods--I\r\nsuppose clever men have--and that I don't suit all the moods equally\r\nwell.\" She squeezed his hand for a second. \"But I'm going to be very\r\nwise--Isobel's taught me to be wise, among other things, you know--I'm\r\ngoing to be very wise, and not mind that!\"\r\n\r\nThe true affection rose in him. \"Poor little sweetheart!\" he murmured.\r\n\"I'm afraid you haven't taken on an easy job.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't think I have,\" she laughed. \"All the more credit if I bring\r\nit off! There'd be nothing to be proud of in making--oh, well, Andy\r\nHayes, for instance--happy. He just is happy as long as he can be\r\nworking at something or walking somewhere--it doesn't matter where--at\r\nfive miles an hour--in the dust by preference. A girl would have nothing\r\nto do but just smile at him and send him for a walk. But you're\r\ndifferent, aren't you, Harry?\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, I am! Andy's one of the best fellows in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I think--oh, it's only my view--that you're more interesting,\r\nHarry. Only, when you are bored, I want you--\"\r\n\r\n\"Now don't say you want me to tell you so! Do let us be decently polite,\r\neven if I am your husband.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed. \"I won't strain your manners so far as that; I'm proud of\r\ntheir being so good myself. No, I want you just to go away and amuse\r\nyourself somewhere else till the fit's over. You may even flirt just a\r\nlittle, if you feel it really necessary, Harry! You needn't be quite so\r\nreligiously strict all your life as you've been lately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Religiously strict? How do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, all this time I don't believe you've allowed yourself one good\r\nlook at Isobel, though she's very good-looking; and I know you haven't\r\ncalled at the Lion yet, though Miss Flower has been there two days, and\r\nshe such an old friend of yours in London.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you called there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I went yesterday. I like her so much, and I like that odd friend\r\nof hers too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Sally Dutton! I suppose she got her knife into me, didn't she?\"\r\n\r\n\"She got her knife, as you call it, into everybody who was mentioned. Oh\r\nyes, including you!\" Vivien laughed merrily.\r\n\r\n\"It's rather a bore--those girls coming down here. I hope we shan't see\r\ntoo much of them.\" He rose. \"I'm afraid I must go, Vivien. We're due at\r\nMedfold Crossways to-night, and it's a good long drive, even with the\r\nmotor. I've got to have some abominable hybrid of a meal at five.\"\r\n\r\nShe too rose and came to him, putting her hands in his. Her laughing\r\nface grew grave and tender.\r\n\r\n\"Dear, you really are happy?\" she asked softly, yet rather insistently.\r\n\r\nHe looked into her eyes; they were not veiled or remote for him.\r\n\"Honestly I believe you're the only chance of happiness I've got in the\r\nworld, Vivien. Is that enough?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it's really more than being happy, or than being sure you will\r\nbe happy.\" She smiled. \"It gives me more to do, at all events.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if I made you unhappy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be hurt, please don't be hurt, but just a little of that wouldn't\r\nsurprise me. Oh, my dear, you don't think I should change to you just\r\nbecause of a little unhappiness? When you've given me all the happiness\r\nI've ever had!\"\r\n\r\n\"All you've ever had? Poor child!\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't quite loyal to let that slip out. And it was my own fault, of\r\ncourse, mostly. But they--they were sometimes rather hard on me.\" She\r\nsmiled piteously. \"For my good? Perhaps it was. Without it, you mightn't\r\nhave cared for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it as much to you as that?\" he asked, a note of fear, almost of\r\ndistress, in his voice.\r\n\r\nShe marked it, and answered gaily, \"It wouldn't be worth having if it\r\nwasn't, Harry!\"\r\n\r\nHe kissed her fondly and tenderly, praying in his heart that he might\r\nnot turn all her happiness to grief.\r\n\r\nHer presence had wrought on him at last in its old way; if it had not\r\ngiven him peace, yet it had shown him where the chance of peace lay, if\r\nhe would take it. It had again made him hate the thing he had been\r\ndoing, and himself for doing it; again it had made him almost hate the\r\nwoman whom and whom only he had, in truth, that day come to see. It had\r\nmade the right thing seem again within his reach, made the idea of\r\ngiving up Vivien look both impossibly cruel to her and impossibly\r\nfoolish for himself. Yet he was, like Isobel, in great fear--in almost\r\nhopeless fear. These two, with their imperious desire for one another,\r\nbecame, each to the other, a terror--in themselves terrors, and the\r\nsource of every danger threatening from outside.\r\n\r\n\"She gave me the chance of ending it last night. If only I could take\r\nher at her word!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not after to-night!\" she had said. He remembered the words in a flash\r\nof hope. But he remembered also that his answer had been, \"Ah, you do!\"\r\nand a kiss. If she said again, \"Not after to-night!\"--aye, said it again\r\nand again--would not the answer always be, \"Ah, but to-night at least!\"\r\nSuch words ever promised salvation, but brought none; they were worse\r\nthan useless. Under a specious pledge of the future, they abandoned the\r\npresent hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI.\r\n\r\nA CHOICE OF EVILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best parlour--the private sitting-room--at the Lion was on the\r\nground floor, just opposite the private bar, and boasted a large bay\r\nwindow, commanding a full view of High Street. A low broad bench,\r\ncomfortably cushioned, ran round the window, and afforded to Miss Flower\r\na favourable station from which to observe what was doing in the town.\r\nOn fine days, such as ruled just now, when the window was thrown up, the\r\nposition also served as a rendezvous to which her growing band of\r\nfriends and admirers could resort to exchange compliments, to post her\r\nin the latest news, or just to get a sight of her. Jack Rock would\r\nstroll across from his shop three or four times a day; Andy would stop a\r\nfew minutes on his way to or from his lodgings; Billy would stretch his\r\nlong legs over the sill and effect an entry; Vivien ask if she might\r\ncome in for a few minutes; Chinks cast an eye as he hurried to his\r\noffice; the Bird find an incredible number of occasions for passing on\r\nhis daily duties. There the Nun sat, surveying the traffic of Meriton,\r\nand fully aware that Meriton, in its turn, honoured her with a\r\nflattering attention. Within the Lion itself she already reigned\r\nsupreme; old Mr. Dove was at her feet, so was old Cox and the other\r\n_habitues_ of the private bar; the Bird, as already hinted, was \"knocked\r\nsilly\"--this contemptuous phrase for a sudden passion was Miss Miles'.\r\nYet even Miss Miles was affable, and quite content to avenge herself for\r\nthe Bird's desertion (which she justly conceived to be temporary) by a\r\nmarked increase in those across-the-counter pleasantries which she had\r\nonce assured her employer were carried on wholly and solely for the\r\nbenefit of his business. The fact was that Miss Miles had once\r\nofficiated at the bar of a \"theatre of varieties,\" and this constituted\r\na professional tie between the Nun and herself, strong enough to defy\r\nany trifling awkwardness caused by a wavering in the Bird's affections.\r\n\r\nBut the Nun's most notable and complete conquest was over Mr. Belfield.\r\nBilly Foot had brought him--not his son Harry--and speedily thereafter\r\nhe called on his own account, full of courtly excuses because his wife,\r\nowing to a touch of cold, was not with him; he hoped that she would be\r\nable to come very soon. (Mr. Belfield was engaged on another small\r\ndomestic struggle, such as had preceded Andy Hayes' first dinner at\r\nHalton.) Serenely indifferent to the minutiae of etiquette, Miss Flower\r\nallowed it to appear that she would just as soon receive Mr. Belfield by\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHe interpreted her permission as applying to more than one visit;\r\nsomehow or other, most days found him by the bay window, and generally,\r\non being pressed, at leisure to come in and rest. They would chat over\r\nall manner of things together, each imparting to the other from a store\r\nof experiences strange to the listener; or together they would discuss\r\ntheir common friends in Meriton. She liked his shrewd and humorous\r\nwisdom; her directness and simplicity charmed him no less than the\r\nextreme prettiness of her face.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Miss Flower,\" he said one morning, \"the boys finish their\r\nspeechifying to-morrow, and then they'll be more at liberty to amuse\r\nyou, instead of leaving it so much to the old stagers.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then you'll all be getting busy about the wedding. In three weeks\r\nnow, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a few days over three weeks. Individually I shall be glad when\r\nit's over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have they done well with their speeches?\" she asked. \"After all my good\r\nintentions, I only went once.\"\r\n\r\n\"They think they've made the seat absolutely safe for Harry. Parliament\r\nand marriage--the boy's taking on responsibilities!\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems funny, when one's just played about with them! It's a funny\r\nthing to be just one of people's amusements--off the stage as well as on\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come!\" He smiled. \"Is that all you claim to be--to any of those\r\nboys?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the way they look at me--in their sober moments. Except Andy;\r\nhe's quite different. He's never been about town, you see. For him girls\r\nand women are all in the same class.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was once about town myself,\" Belfield remarked thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and you take your son's view--and Billy Foot's.\" He smiled again,\r\nand she smiled too, meeting his glance directly. \"Oh yes, Billy\r\ntoo--though he may have his temptations! Squarely now, Mr. Belfield,\r\nif--for the sake of argument--your son treated Miss Wellgood badly, or\r\neven Miss Vintry, it would seem a different thing from treating Sally or\r\nme badly, wouldn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You do put it pretty squarely,\" said Belfield, twisting his lips.\r\n\r\n\"A glass of beer gives you the right to flirt with poor Miss Miles. It's\r\nsupposed to be champagne with us. When you were about town--don't you\r\nremember?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it was. It's not a tradition to be proud of.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are compensations--which some of us like. If Sally or I behave\r\nbadly, who cares? But if Miss Wellgood or Miss Vintry--! Oh, dear me,\r\nthe heavens would fall in Meriton!\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way, I'm afraid I drive your friend away? Miss Dutton always\r\ndisappears when I call.\"\r\n\r\n\"She generally disappears when people come. Sally's shy of strangers.\r\nWell, you know, as I was saying, Andy Hayes hasn't got that tradition. I\r\nthink if I ever fell in love--I never do, Mr. Belfield--I should fall in\r\nlove with a man who hadn't that tradition. But they're very hard to\r\nfind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's suppose it's one of those thousand things that are going to\r\nchange,\" he suggested, with his sceptical smile.\r\n\r\n\"Do things between men and women change much, in spite of all the talk?\r\nYou've read history, I haven't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have to a certain extent. I don't know that I'm inclined to give\r\nyou the result of my researches. Not very cheerful! And, meanwhile,\r\nthere's Andy Hayes!\"\r\n\r\n\"I never do it,\" the Nun repeated firmly. \"Besides, in this case I've\r\nnot been asked. I'm not the sort of girl he would fall in love with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you forgive an old man's compliment, Miss Flower, if I say I don't\r\nknow the sort of man who wouldn't--I'll put it mildly, I'll say\r\nmightn't--fall in love with the sort of girl you are?\"\r\n\r\n\"I forgive it, but it's not as clever as you generally are. Andy always\r\nwants to help. Well, I don't want anybody to help me, you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"The delight of the eyes?\" he suggested. \"What? That doesn't count? Only\r\nsuch as you can afford to say so!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think it counts much with Andy. He appreciates, oh yes! He\r\nalmost stared me out of countenance the first time we met; and that's\r\nsupposed to be difficult--in London! But I don't think it really counts\r\nfor a great deal. Andy's not a love-making man; he's emphatically a\r\nmarrying man.\"\r\n\r\n\"You draw that distinction? But the love-making men marry?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the end perhaps--generally rather by accident. They haven't the\r\ninstinct.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've thought about these things a good deal, Miss Flower.\"\r\n\r\n\"I live almost entirely among men, you see,\" she answered simply. \"And\r\nthey show me more than they show girls of--of that other class. Shall I\r\ncall again on your reminiscences?\" She smiled suddenly and brightly.\r\n\"Miss Wellgood's being awfully nice to me. She's been here twice, and\r\nI'm going to tea at Nutley to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's one of the dearest girls in the world,\" said Belfield. \"Harry's a\r\nlucky fellow.\" He glanced at the Nun. \"I hope he appreciates it\r\nproperly. I believe he does.\"\r\n\r\nShe offered no comment, and a rather blank silence followed. If Belfield\r\nhad sought a reassurance, he had not received it. On the other hand she\r\ngave away no secrets. She, like the silence, was blank, looking away\r\nfrom him, down High Street.\r\n\r\nThe Bird passed the window; Jack Rock trotted by on a young horse; one\r\nof his business equipages clattered along not far behind him; the quiet\r\nold street basked and dozed in the sun.\r\n\r\n\"What a dear rest it is--this little town!\" said the Nun softly. \"Surely\r\nnothing but what's happy and peaceful and pleasant can ever happen\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\nSally Dutton came by, returning from a stroll to which she had betaken\r\nherself on Belfield's arrival.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Sally, been amusing yourself?\" the Nun called.\r\n\r\n\"The streets present their usual gay and animated aspect,\" observed Miss\r\nDutton, as she entered the Lion.\r\n\r\n\"There are the two sides of the question,\" laughed Belfield. \"The line\r\nbetween peace and dullness--each man draws it for himself--in\r\npencil--with india-rubber handy! I'm really afraid we're not amusing\r\nMiss Dutton?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, she's all right. That's only her way.\" She smiled reflectively;\r\nSally always amused her.\r\n\r\nBelfield rose to take leave. \"We can't let Nutley beat us,\" he said. \"We\r\nmust have you at Halton too!\" He was led into assuming that his little\r\ndomestic struggle would end in victory.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, still smiling. \"Wait and see how I behave at Nutley\r\nfirst. If Harry gives a good report of me--I suppose he'll be\r\nthere?--ask me to Halton!\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed, and so let the question go. After all, it would not do to be\r\ntoo sudden with his wife.\r\n\r\n\"You needn't be afraid of Harry. But Wellgood's rather a formidable\r\ncharacter.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Miss Vintry? Is she alarming?\"\r\n\r\nHe pursed up his lips. \"I think she might be called a little--alarming.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll have a good look at her--and perhaps I'll let you know what I\r\nthink of her,\" said the Nun, with no more than the slightest twinkle in\r\nher eyes. It was enough for Belfield's quickness; it was much more\r\ninforming than the blank silence--though even that had set him thinking.\r\n\r\nBut the Nun's account of her first visit to Nutley chanced--or perhaps\r\nit was not chance--to be rendered not to Belfield, but to Andy Hayes.\r\nAfter the last meeting of the campaign, he had gone round to smoke a\r\npipe with Jack Rock. Leaving him hard on midnight--there had been much\r\nto be wormed out of Andy concerning his speeches, their reception, the\r\napplause--he saw a light still burning in the window at the Lion. As he\r\ndrew near, he perceived that the window was open, and he heard a voice\r\ncrooning softly. He made bold to look in. The Nun was alone; she sat in\r\nthe window, doing nothing, singing to herself. \"Boo!\" said Andy, putting\r\nhis big head in at the window.\r\n\r\n\"Andy!\" she cried, her face lighting up. \"Jump in! You've come to scare\r\nthe devils! There are a hundred of them, and they won't go away for all\r\nmy singing. And Sally's gone to bed, prophesying a breaking of at least\r\nsix out of the Ten Commandments! And only yesterday I told Mr. Belfield\r\nthat nothing unpleasant could happen in Meriton! Where is one to go for\r\nquiet if things happen in Meriton?\"\r\n\r\nAn outburst like this was most unusual with the Nun. It produced on\r\nAndy's face such a look of mild wonder as may be seen on a St. Bernard's\r\nwhen a toy-terrier barks furiously.\r\n\r\n\"What's happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been at Nutley.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes! Harry came on from there in the car--got to the meeting rather\r\nlate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something's happened--or is happening--in that house.\" She looked at\r\nhim sharply. \"You've been here longer than I have--do you know anything?\r\nGo on with your pipe.\"\r\n\r\nAndy considered long, smoking his pipe.\r\n\r\n\"You do know something!\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"I've ground for some uneasiness,\" he admitted.\r\n\r\nShe nodded. \"It was all sort of underground,\" she said. \"Really most\r\nuncomfortable! They'd try to get away from it, and yet come back to\r\nit--those three--Mr. Wellgood, Harry, and that Miss Vintry. Poor Vivien\r\nseemed quite outside of it all, but somehow conscious of it--and\r\nunhappy. She saw there was--what shall I say?--antagonism, you know. And\r\nshe didn't know why. Have you seen anything that would make Mr. Wellgood\r\nsavage if he saw it?\"\r\n\r\n\"He didn't see what I saw.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not that time anyhow!\" she amended quickly.\r\n\r\nAndy frowned. \"That time, I mean, of course. If he's seen anything of\r\nthat sort, or suspected it, naturally, as Vivien Wellgood's father--\"\r\n\r\n\"Vivien's father!\" Her tone was full of impatience for his stupidity. \"I\r\nsuppose no woman has ever been to Nutley lately? Oh, Vivien's not one;\r\nshe's a saint--and that's neither male nor female. Vivien's father!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been there off and on,\" said Andy.\r\n\r\n\"You! Have you ever seen--not that I suppose you'd notice it--a woman\r\nkeeping two men from one another's throats, trying to make them think\r\nthere's nothing to quarrel about, trying to say things that one could\r\ntake in one way, and the other in the other--and third persons not take\r\nin any way at all? Oh, it's a pretty game, and I'm bound to say she\r\nplays it finely. But she's on thin ice, that woman, and she knows it.\r\nVivien's father!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you go on repeating 'Vivien's father'?\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't.\" She leant forward and laid her small hand on his arm. \"Isobel\r\nVintry's lover, then! The man's in love with her, Andy, as sure as we\r\nsit here. In love--and furious!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd never thought of that. Do you feel sure of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have thought of the other thing--and you're sure of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know Harry. I hoped it would all--all come to nothing. How much do\r\nyou think Wellgood knows, or suspects?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hard to say. I think he's groping in the dark. He's had a check, I\r\nexpect, or a set-back. Men always think that's due to another man--I\r\nsuppose it generally is. Well, it's not you, and it's not Billy. Who\r\nelse sees her--who else goes to Nutley?\"\r\n\r\n\"But he'd never suspect his own daughter's--\"\r\n\r\n\"You do!\"\r\n\r\n\"I had the evidence of my eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jealousy's quicker than the eyes, Andy.\" She leant forward again. \"What\r\ndid you see?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems disloyal to tell--disloyal to Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"My loyalty's for Vivien!\" she said. \"What about yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Take it that what I saw justifies your fears about Harry,\" said Andy\r\nslowly. \"I think--I'm not sure--I think he suspects I saw. I don't know\r\nwhether she does.\" He was not aware that Isobel had made herself quite\r\ncertain of his knowledge. \"But it's nearly a month ago. You know Harry.\r\nI hoped it was all over. Only he seemed a little--queer.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Come and spend a quiet afternoon in the garden'--that was her\r\ninvitation. Poor girl!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what you called her the first time I told you of their\r\nengagement.\"\r\n\r\n\"A nice quiet afternoon--sitting on the top of a volcano! With an\r\neruption overdue!\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't possible to feel quite comfortable about it, is it?\" said\r\nAndy.\r\n\r\nThe Nun laughed a little scornfully. \"Not quite. Going to do anything\r\nabout it?\"\r\n\r\nAndy raised his eyes to hers. \"I owe almost everything I value most in\r\nthe world to Harry, directly or indirectly; even what I owe to you and\r\nJack came in a way through him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he's never taken ten minutes' real trouble about you in his life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure that makes any difference--even if it's true. He stands\r\nfor all those things to me. As for Miss Vintry--\" He shrugged his\r\nponderous shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, by all means to blazes with Miss Vintry!\" the Nun agreed\r\npleasantly.\r\n\r\nMiss Dutton put her head in at the door--her hair about her shoulders.\r\n\"Ever coming to bed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet. I'm talking to Andy. Don't you see him, Sally?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not respectable.\"\r\n\r\n\"The window's open, there's a street lamp opposite, and a policeman\r\nstanding under it. Good-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't come into my room and wake me up jawing.\" Miss Dutton\r\nwithdrew.\r\n\r\nThe Nun looked at Andy. \"I wonder if it's quite fair to say 'To blazes\r\nwith Miss Vintry!'\"\r\n\r\n\"You said it with a good deal of conviction a moment ago. What makes\r\nyou--?\" His eyes met hers.\r\n\r\n\"Who told you about Sally? I never did,\" the Nun exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Harry, after our first supper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here was rather the same case--only, of course, she never knew the\r\nother girl. I think that makes a difference. And she never really had a\r\nchance. That makes no difference, I suppose. The policeman's gone. I\r\nexpect you'd better go too, Andy.\"\r\n\r\nAndy swung his legs over the window-sill. \"Are you going to try and put\r\nyour oar in?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Would you think me wrong if I did?\"\r\n\r\nAndy sat quite a long while on the window-sill, dangling his legs over\r\nthe pavement of High Street.\r\n\r\n\"I've thought about it a good deal,\" he answered. \"Especially lately.\"\r\n\r\nShe knelt on the broad low bench just behind him. \"Yes, and the\r\nresult--when you're ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think a row would be the best thing that could happen.\" He turned his\r\nface round to her as he spoke.\r\n\r\nThe Nun gasped. \"That's thorough,\" she remarked. \"So much for your\r\nopinion about Harry!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, so much for that,\" Andy admitted.\r\n\r\n\"If there is a row, I hope you'll be there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't!\" exclaimed Andy with a natural and human sincerity.\r\n\r\n\"To prevent bloodshed!\" She laid her hand on his arm. \"I'm not\r\naltogether joking. I didn't like Mr. Wellgood's eyes this afternoon.\"\r\nShe patted his arm gently before she withdrew her hand. \"Good-night,\r\ndear old Andy. You're terribly right as a rule. But about this--\" She\r\nbroke off, impatiently jerking her head.\r\n\r\nWith a clasp of her hand and a doleful smile, Andy let his legs drop on\r\nthe pavement and departed.\r\n\r\nSo that was his verdict, given with all his deliberation, with all the\r\nweight of his leisurely broad-viewing judgment. The real thing to avoid\r\nwas not the \"row;\" that was his conclusion. There was a thing, then,\r\nworse than the \"row\"--the thing for which Halton and Nutley--nay, all\r\nMeriton, would soon be making joyful preparation. His calm face had not\r\nmoved even at her word \"bloodshed.\" Oh yes, Andy was thorough! Not even\r\nthat word swayed his mind. Perhaps he did not believe in her fears. But\r\nhis look had not been scornful; it had been thoughtfully interrogative.\r\nHe had possessed that knowledge of his for a long while; he had never\r\nused it. At first from loyalty to Harry--even now that would, she\r\nthought, be enough to make him very loth to use it. But another reason\r\nwas predominant, born of his long silent brooding. He had come to a\r\nconclusion about his hero; the court had taken time for consideration;\r\nthe judgment was advised. There was no helping some people. They must be\r\nleft to their own ways, their own devices, their own doom. To help them\r\nwas to harm others; to fight for them was to serve under the banner of\r\nwrong and of injustice. Friendship and loyalty could not justify that.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion seemed a hard one. She stood long at the big window--a\r\ndainty little figure thrown up by the light behind her--painfully\r\nreaching forward to the understanding of how what seems hardness may be\r\na broader, a truer, a better-directed sympathy, how it may be a duty to\r\nleave a wastrel to waste, how not every drowning man is worth the labour\r\nthat it takes to get him out of the water--for that once. At all events,\r\nnot worth the risk of another, a more valuable life.\r\n\r\nAnd that was his conclusion about his hero, the man to whom he owed, as\r\nhe had said, almost everything he prized? Had he, then, any right to the\r\nconclusion, right in the abstract though it might be? It was a hard\r\nworld that drove men to such hard conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe case was hard--and the conclusion. But not, of necessity, the man\r\nwho painfully arrived at it. Yet the man might be biassed; sympathy for\r\nthe deceived might paint the deceiver's conduct in colours even blacker\r\nthan the truth demanded. Doris did not think of this, in part because\r\nthe judgment had seemed too calm and too reluctant to be the offspring\r\nof bias, more because, if there were any partiality in it, she herself\r\nhad become a no less strong, and a more impetuous, adherent of the same\r\ncause. Vivien had won all her fealty. The one pleasant feature of the\r\nafternoon had been when Vivien walked home with her and, wrought upon by\r\nthe troubled atmosphere of Nutley even though ignorant of its cause, had\r\nopened her heart to Harry's old friend, to a girl who, as she felt, must\r\nknow more of the world than she did, and perhaps, out of her experience,\r\ncould comfort and even guide. With sweet and simple gravity, with a\r\ndelicacy that made her confidence seem still reserved although it was\r\nwell-nigh complete, she showed to her companion her love and her\r\napprehension--a love so pure in quality, an apprehension based on so\r\nrare an understanding of the man she loved. She did not know the things\r\nhe had done, nor the thing he was now doing; but the man himself she\r\nknew, and envisaged dimly the perils by which he was beset. Her loving\r\nsympathy tried to leap across the wide chasm that separated her life and\r\nher nature from his, and came wonderfully little short of its mark.\r\n\r\n\"I really knew hardly anything about him when I accepted him; he was\r\njust a girl's hero to me. But I have watched and watched, and now I know\r\na good deal.\"\r\n\r\nAn excellent mood for a wife, no doubt--or for a husband--excellent,\r\nand, it may be, inevitable. But for a lover yet unmated, a bride still\r\nto be, a girl in her first love? Should she not leave reverend seniors\r\nto prate to her--quite vainly--of difficulties and dangers, while her\r\nfancy is roaming far afield in dreamy lands of golden joy? To endeavour,\r\nby an affectionate study of and consideration for your partner, to avoid\r\nunhappiness and to give comfort--such is wont to be the text of the\r\nofficiating minister's little homily at a wedding. Is it to be supposed\r\nthat bride and bridegroom are putting the matter quite that way in their\r\nhearts? If they were, a progressive diminution in the marriage-rate\r\nmight be expected.\r\n\r\nSo ran the Nun's criticism, full of sympathy with the girl, not perhaps\r\nquite so full of sympathy for what seemed to her an over-saintly\r\nabnegation of her sex's right. The bitterest anti-feminist will agree\r\nthat a girl should be worshipped while she is betrothed; he will allow\r\nher that respite of dominion in a life which, according to his\r\nopponents, his theories reduce, for all its remaining years, to\r\nservitude. Vivien was already serving--serving and watching\r\nanxiously--amid all her love. At this Doris rebelled--she who never fell\r\nin love. But she was quicker to grow fond of people than to criticize\r\ntheir points of view. Vivien's over-saintliness did sinful Harry's cause\r\nno service. If this were Vivien's mood in the light of her study of what\r\nher lover was, how would she stand towards the knowledge of what he did?\r\n\r\nYet Andy Hayes thought that the best thing now possible was that she\r\nshould come to the knowledge of it--that was what he meant by there\r\nbeing a \"row.\" That opinion of his was a mightily strong endorsement of\r\nVivien's anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you now and then feel like backing out of it?\" the Nun had asked\r\nwith her usual directness.\r\n\r\nVivien's answer came with a laugh, suddenly scornful, suddenly merry,\r\n\"Why, it's all my life!\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun shook her sage little head; these things were not all people's\r\nlives--oh dear, no! She knew better than that, did Doris! But then the\r\nfoolish obstinate folk would go on believing that they were, and\r\nthereby, for the time, made the trouble just as great as though their\r\ndelusion were gospel truth.\r\n\r\nThen Vivien had turned penitent about her fears, and remorseful for the\r\nexpression of them. By an easy process penitence led to triumph, and she\r\nfell to singing Harry's praises, to painting again that brightly\r\ncoloured future--the marvellous things to be seen and done by Harry's\r\nside. She smiled gently, rather mysteriously; the sound of the wonderful\r\nwords was echoing in her ears. Doris saw her face, and pressed her hand\r\nin a holy silence.\r\n\r\nThe result of her various conversations, of her own reflections, and of\r\nher personal inspection of the situation at Nutley was to throw Miss\r\nDoris Flower into perhaps the gravest perplexity under which she had\r\never suffered. When you are accustomed to rule your life--and other\r\npeople's, on occasion--by the simple rule of doing the obvious thing, it\r\nis disconcerting to be confronted with a case in which there appears to\r\nbe no obvious thing to do, where there is only a choice of evils, and\r\nthe choice seems balanced with a perverse and malicious equality. From\r\nVivien's side of the matter--Doris troubled herself no more with her old\r\nfriend Harry's--the marriage was risky far beyond the average of\r\nmatrimonial risks; but the \"row\" was terribly risky too, with the girl\r\nin that mood about \"all her life.\" If she had that mood badly upon her,\r\nshe might do--well, girls did do all sorts of things sometimes, holding\r\nthat life had nothing left in it.\r\n\r\nThough there was nothing obvious, there must be something sensible; at\r\nleast one thing must be more sensible than the other. Was it more\r\nsensible to do nothing--which was to favour the \"row\"--or to attempt\r\nsomething--which was to work for the marriage? Her temperament asserted\r\nitself, and led her to a conclusion in conflict with Andy's. She was by\r\nnature inclined always to do something. In the end the \"row\" was a\r\ncertain evil; the marriage only a risk. Men do settle down--sometimes!\r\n(She wrinkled her nose as she propounded, and qualified, this\r\nproposition.) The risk was preferable to the certainty. After all, her\r\npractical sense whispered, in these days even marriage is not wholly\r\nirrevocable. Yes, she would be for the marriage and against the\r\n\"row\"--and she would tell Andy that.\r\n\r\nSomething was to be done then. But what? That seemed to the Nun a much\r\neasier question--a welcome reappearance of the obvious thing.\r\n\r\n\"I must find out what the woman really wants. Until we know that, it's\r\nsimply working in the dark.\"\r\n\r\nSo she concluded, and at last turned on her side and went to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII.\r\n\r\nREFORMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn very truth the atmosphere at Nutley was heavy with threatening\r\nclouds; unless a fair wind came to scatter them, the storm must soon\r\nbreak. Isobel had fled within her feminine barricades--the barricades\r\nwhich women are so clever at constructing and at persuading the\r\nconventions of life to help them to defend. A woman's solitudes may not\r\nbe stormed; with address she can escape private encounters. In sore fear\r\nof Harry because sore afraid of herself, she gave him no opportunity. In\r\nsore fear of Wellgood, she shrank from facing him with a rupture of\r\ntheir secret arrangement. Both men were tricked out of their stolen\r\ninterviews--Wellgood out of his legitimate privilege, Harry out of his\r\ntrespassing. Each asked why; in each jealousy harked back to its one\r\ndefinite starting-point--Harry's to her suggestions about her relations\r\nwith Vivien's father, Wellgood's to Belfield's hints that, as a\r\ncompanion, Isobel was needlessly good looking. To each of them matter of\r\namusement at the time when they were made, they took on now a new\r\nsignificance; so irony loves to confront our past and present moods. But\r\nWellgood held a card that was not in Harry's hand--a card which could\r\nnot win the game, but could at least secure an opening. He was employer\r\nas well as lover. Vivien's father could command the presence of Vivien's\r\ncompanion--not indeed late at night, for that would be a scarcely\r\njudicious straining of his powers, but at any reputable\r\nbusiness-transacting hour of the day. For two nights--and that day of\r\nwhich the Nun had been a witness--he suffered the evasion of his rights;\r\nthen, with a suavity dangerous in a man so rough, he prayed Miss\r\nVintry's presence in the study for ten minutes (the established period!)\r\nbefore dinner; there were ways and means to be discussed, he said,\r\nmatters touching the _trousseau_ and the wedding entertainment. Vivien\r\nwas bidden to run away and dress. \"We're preparing one or two surprises\r\nfor you, my dear,\" he said to her, with a grim smile which carried for\r\nIsobel a hidden reference.\r\n\r\nThus commanded in Vivien's presence, Isobel was cleverly caught between\r\nthe duty of obedience and the abandonment of her ostensible position in\r\nthe house. Her barricade was being outflanked; she was forced into the\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nShe was in fear of him, almost actual physical fear; whether more of his\r\nfondness or of his roughness she could not tell; she felt that she could\r\nhardly bear either. Since her avowal to Harry, her courage had never\r\nreturned, her weapons seemed blunted, she was no more mistress of all\r\nher resources. Yet in the end she feared the fondness more, and would at\r\nall costs avoid that. She summoned the remnants of her once brilliant\r\narray of bravery.\r\n\r\nAlone with her, he wasted no time on the artifice which had secured him\r\nprivacy.\r\n\r\n\"What's this new fad, Isobel? You're wilfully avoiding me. One evening\r\nyou turn faint; another you dodge me, and are off to bed! Though I don't\r\nthink I've ever made exacting claims on your time, considering!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been afraid--you'd better hear the truth--to speak to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like the truth, certainly, if I can get it. What have you been\r\nafraid to speak to me about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Our engagement.\" She made the plunge, her eyes fixed apprehensively on\r\nhis face. \"I--I can't go on with it, Mr. Wellgood.\"\r\n\r\nHe had schooled himself for this answer; he made no outburst. His tone\r\nwas mild; the cunning of jealousy gave him an alien smoothness.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, my dear, and tell me why.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat facing him, his writing-table between them.\r\n\r\n\"My feelings haven't--haven't developed as I hoped they would.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, your feelings haven't developed?\" he repeated slowly. \"Towards me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I reserved the right to change my mind--you remember?\"\r\n\r\n\"And I the right to be unpleasant about it.\" He smiled under intent\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"I'll leave the house to-morrow, if you like,\" she cried, eager now to\r\naccept a banishment she had once dreaded.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no! I'm not going to be unpleasant. We needn't do things like\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I think I should prefer it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry you should feel that. There's no need; you shan't be\r\nannoyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's good of you. I thought you'd be very, very hard to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would that be the best way to win you back? I don't know--at any rate I\r\ndon't feel like following it. But really you can't go off at a moment's\r\nnotice--and just now! What would Vivien think? What are we to say to\r\nher? What would everybody think? And how are Vivien and I to get through\r\nall this business of the wedding?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it would be awkward, and look odd, but it might be better. Your\r\nfeelings--\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind my feelings; you know they're not my weak spot. Come,\r\nIsobel, you see now you've no cause to be afraid of me, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're behaving very kindly--more kindly than perhaps I could expect.\"\r\nDown in her mind there was latent distrust of this unwonted\r\nuncharacteristic kindness. Yet it looked genuine enough. There was no\r\nreference to the name she dreaded; no hint, no sneer, about Harry\r\nBelfield. She rose to a hope that her tricks and her fencing had been\r\nsuccessful, that he was quite in the dark, that the issue was to his\r\nmind between their two selves alone, with no intruder.\r\n\r\nWellgood's jealousy bade him be proud of his effort, and encouraged him\r\nto persevere. The natural temper of the man might be raging, almost to\r\nthe laying of hands on her; it must be kept down; the time for it was\r\nnot yet. Rudeness or roughness would give her an excuse for flight; he\r\nwould not have her fly. A plausible kindness, a considerate\r\nsmoothness--that was the card jealousy selected for him to play.\r\n\r\n\"You shan't be troubled, you shan't be annoyed. I'll give up my evening\r\ntreat. We'll go back to our old footing--before I spoke to you about\r\nthis. I'll ask nothing of you as a lover--well, except not to decide\r\nfinally against me till the wedding. Only three weeks! But as my friend,\r\nand Vivien's, I do ask you not to leave us in the lurch now--at this\r\nparticular moment--and not to risk setting everybody talking. If you\r\ninsist on leaving me, go after the wedding. That means no change in our\r\nplan, except that you won't come back. That'll seem quite natural; it's\r\nwhat they all expect.\"\r\n\r\nStill never a word of Harry, no hint of resentment, nothing that could\r\nalarm her or give her a handle for offence! Whether from friend or\r\nlover, his request sounded most moderate and reasonable. Not to leave\r\nthe friend in the lurch, not to decide with harsh haste against a\r\npatient lover who had been given cause for confident hope, almost for\r\ncertainty! He left her no plausible answer, for she could adduce no\r\ngrievance against him. He had but taken what for her own purposes she\r\nhad been content to allow--first in his bluff flirtation, then in his\r\nill-restrained endearments. There was no plausibility in turning round\r\nand pretending to resent these things now. She dared not take false\r\npoints in an encounter so perilous; that would be to expose herself to a\r\ncrushing reply.\r\n\r\n\"If you go now--all of a sudden, at this moment--I can't help thinking\r\nyou'll put yourself under a slur, or else put me under one. People know\r\nthe position you've been in here--practically mistress of the house,\r\nwith Vivien in your entire charge. Very queer to leave three weeks\r\nbefore her wedding! You may invent excuses, or we may. An aunt\r\ndying--something of that sort! Nobody ever believes in those dying\r\naunts!\"\r\n\r\nIt was all true; people did not believe in those dying aunts, not when\r\nsudden departures of handsome young women were in question. People would\r\ntalk; the thing would look odd. His plausible cunning left her no\r\nloophole.\r\n\r\n\"If you wish it, I'll stay till the wedding, on our old footing--as we\r\nwere before all this, I mean. But you mustn't think there's any chance\r\nof my--my changing again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you.\" He put out his hand across the table. She could not but\r\ntake it. Though he seemed so cool and quiet, the hand was very hot. He\r\nheld hers for a long while, his eyes intently fixed on her in a regard\r\nwhich she could not fathom, but which filled her anew with fear. She\r\nfell into a tremble; her lips quivered.\r\n\r\n\"Let me go now, please,\" she entreated, her eyes unable to meet his any\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nHe released her hand, and leant back in his chair. He smiled at her\r\nagain, as he said, \"Yes, go now. I'm afraid this interview has been\r\nrather trying to you--perhaps to us both.\"\r\n\r\nOf all the passions, the sufferings, the undergoings of mankind, none\r\nhas so relentlessly been put to run the gauntlet of ridicule as\r\njealousy. It is the sport of the composer of light verses, the born\r\nmaterial of the writer of farce--especially when it is well founded. It\r\nis perhaps strange to remark--could any strangeness outlast\r\nfamiliarity--that the supreme study of it treats of it as utterly\r\nunfounded, and finds its highest tragedy in its baselessness. Ridiculous\r\nwhen justifiable, tragic when all a delusion! Is that nature's view,\r\neven as it is so often art's? Certainly the race is obstinate in holding\r\nreal failure in the conflict of sex as small recommendation in a hero,\r\nimagined as the opportunity for his highest effect. King Arthur hardly\r\nbears the burden of being deceived; on the baseless suspicion of it the\r\nMoor rides through murder to a triumphant death--and a general\r\nsympathy--unless nowadays women have anything to say on the latter\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nYet this poor passion--commonly so ridiculous,\r\neven more commonly, among the polite, held ill-bred--must be allowed its\r\nfeatures of interest. It is remarkably alert, acute, ingenious, even\r\nlaborious, in its sweeping of details into its net. It works up its\r\nbrief very industriously, be the instructions never so meagre--somehow\r\nit invites legal metaphor, being always plaintiff in the court of sex,\r\nalways with its grievance to prove, generally faced with singularly hard\r\nswearing in the witness box. It has its successes, as witnessed by\r\nnotable phrases; there is the \"unwritten law,\" and there are\r\n\"extenuating circumstances.\" The phrases throw back a rather startling\r\nillumination on the sport of versifiers and the material of farce. But\r\nthe exceptional cases have a trick of stamping themselves on\r\nphraseology. Most of us are jealous with no very momentous results. We\r\ngrumble a little, watch a little, sulk a little, and decide that there\r\nis nothing in it. Often there is not. Likewise we are ambitious without\r\nconvulsing the world--or even our own family circle. So with our lives,\r\nour loves, our deaths--history, poetry, elegy find no place for them.\r\nOnly nature has and keeps a mother's love for the ordinary man, and\r\nholds his doings legitimate matter for her interest, nay, essential to\r\nher eternal unresting plan. She may be figured as investing the bulk of\r\nher fortune in him, as in three per cents.--genius being her occasional\r\n\"flutter.\"\r\n\r\nMark Wellgood was an ordinary man, and he was proud of the fact; that\r\nmust, perhaps, be considered a circumstance of aggravation. He refused\r\nthe suggestions of civilization to modify, and of sentiment to soften,\r\nhis primitive instincts; he was proud of them just as they were. If any\r\nman had come between him and his woman--primitive also were the terms\r\nhis thoughts used--that man should pay for it. If there were any man at\r\nall, who could it be but Harry Belfield? If it were Harry Belfield,\r\nWellgood refused to hold him innocent of an inkling of how matters stood\r\nbetween Isobel and Vivien's father--he must have pretty nearly guessed,\r\neven if she had not told him. At least there were relations between\r\nVivien herself and the suspected trespasser. Did they not give cause\r\nenough for a father's anger, deep and righteous, demanding vengeance?\r\nThey gave cause--and they gave cover. The jealous suitor could use the\r\nindignant father's plea, the indignant father's weapons. The lover's\r\nrevenge would make the father's duty sweet. He was not indifferent to\r\nthe wrong done to Vivien; yet he almost prized it for the advantage it\r\ngave him in his own quarrel. It was not often that jealousy could plume\r\nitself on so honourable and so useful an ally!\r\n\r\nSingle-hearted concern for Vivien would have let Isobel go, as she\r\nprayed, and given Harry either his dismissal or the chance to mend his\r\nways in the absence of temptation. Jealousy imperiously vetoed such\r\nsuggestions. Isobel should not go. Harry should neither be dismissed nor\r\ngiven a fair chance and a fresh start. If he could, Wellgood would still\r\nkeep Isobel; at least he would punish Harry, if he caught him. For the\r\nsake of these things he compromised his daughter's cause, and made her\r\nan instrument for his own purposes. And he did this with no sense of\r\nwrong-doing. So masterful was his self-regarding passion that his\r\ndaughter's claim fell to the status of his pretext.\r\n\r\nSo he smoothed his face and watched.\r\n\r\nBut Isobel too was now on the alert. She was no longer merely resolved\r\nthat she would behave herself because she ought; she saw that perforce\r\nshe must. At least, no more secret dealings! Harry must be told that.\r\nThe hidden hope that his answer would be, \"Open dealings, then, at any\r\ncost,\" beat still in her heart, faintly, yet without ceasing. But if\r\nthat answer came not, then all must be over. Word must go to him of that\r\nbefore he next came to Nutley. Such consolation as lay in knowing that\r\nshe would not marry Wellgood should be his also. Then, perhaps, things\r\nwould go a little easier, and these terrible three weeks slip past\r\nwithout disaster. Terrible--yes; but, alas, the end of them seemed more\r\nterrible yet.\r\n\r\nEven had the post seemed safe, there was none which could reach Harry\r\nbefore he was due at Nutley again. She had to find a messenger. She\r\ndecided on Andy Hayes. He was a safe man; he would not forget to fulfil\r\nhis charge. The very fact of that bit of knowledge he possessed made him\r\nin her eyes the safest messenger; if he had not talked about that other\r\nthing, he was not likely to talk about the letter; unlikely to mention\r\nit in malice, certain not to refer to it in innocence or inadvertence.\r\nAnd she knew where to find him. Andy had, with Wellgood's permission,\r\nresumed his practice of bathing before breakfast in Nutley lake. The\r\nstripes of his bathing-suit were a familiar object to her as he emerged\r\nfrom the bushes or plunged into the water; from her window she could\r\nwatch his powerful strokes. His hour was half-past seven; before eight\r\nnobody but servants would be about.\r\n\r\nAndy, then, emerging from the shrubbery dressed after his dip, found\r\nMiss Vintry strolling up and down.\r\n\r\n\"You're surprised to see me out so early, Mr. Hayes? But I know your\r\nhabits. My window looks out this way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm awfully careful to keep well hidden in the bushes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes!\" she laughed. \"I've not come to warn you off. Are you likely to\r\nsee Mr. Harry this morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"I easily can; I shall be passing Halton.\"\r\n\r\n\"I specially want this note to reach him early in the morning. It's\r\nrather important. I should be so much obliged if you'd take it; and will\r\nyou give it to him yourself?\"\r\n\r\nAndy stood silent for a moment, not offering to take the letter from her\r\nhand. She had foreseen that he might hesitate, knowing what he did; she\r\nhad even thought that his hesitation might give her an opportunity.\r\nFeigning to notice nothing in his manner, she went on, \"I must add that\r\nI shall be glad if you'll give it to him when he's alone, and if you\r\nwon't mention it. It relates to a private matter.\"\r\n\r\nAndy spoke slowly. \"I'm not sure you'd choose me to carry it if you\r\nknew--\"\r\n\r\n\"I do know; at least I never had much doubt, and I've had none since a\r\ntalk we had together at Halton. Do you remember?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't say anything about it then, did I?\" asked Andy.\r\n\r\nShe smiled. \"Not in so many words. You saw a great piece of\r\nfoolishness--the first and last, I need hardly tell you. I'm very much\r\nashamed of it. In that letter I ask Mr. Harry to forget all about it,\r\nand to remember only that I am, and want to go on being, Vivien's\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\nIt sounded well, but Andy was not quite convinced.\r\n\r\n\"It's some time ago now. Mightn't you just ignore it?\"\r\n\r\n\"As far as he's concerned, no doubt I might; but I rather want to get it\r\noff my own conscience, Mr. Hayes. It'll make me happier in meeting him.\r\nI shall be happier in meeting you too, after this little talk. Somehow\r\nthat wretched bit of silliness seems to have made an awkwardness between\r\nus, and I want to leave Nutley good friends with every one.\"\r\n\r\nShe sounded very sincere; nay, in a sense she was sincere. She was\r\nashamed; she did want to end the whole matter--unless that unexpected\r\nanswer came. At any rate she was--or sounded--sincere enough to make\r\nAndy hold out his hand for the letter.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take it and give it to him as you wish, Miss Vintry. I'm bound to\r\nsay, though, that, if apologies are being made, I think Harry's the one\r\nto make them.\"\r\n\r\n\"We women are taught to think such things worse in ourselves than in\r\nmen. Men get carried away; they're allowed to, now and then. We\r\nmustn't.\"\r\n\r\nThe appeal to his chivalry--another wrong to woman!--touched Andy.\r\n\"That's infernally unfair!\"\r\n\r\n\"It sometimes seems so, just a little. I'm sincerely grateful to you,\r\nMr. Hayes.\" She held out her hand to him. \"You won't think it necessary\r\nto mention to Mr. Harry all I've told you? I don't think he was so sure\r\nas I was about--about your presence. And somehow it makes it seem worse\r\nif he knew that you--\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall say nothing whatever, if he doesn't,\" said Andy, as he shook\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you again. I don't think I dare risk asking you to be\r\nfriends--real friends--yet; but I may, perhaps, on the wedding day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've never been your enemy, Miss Vintry.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; you've been kind, considerate\"--her voice dropped--\"merciful. Thank\r\nyou. Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nShe left Andy with her letter in his hands, and her humble thanks\r\nechoing in his ears--words that, in thanking him for his silence, bound\r\nhim to a continuance of it. Andy felt most of the guilt suddenly\r\ntransferred to his shoulders, because he had told the Nun--well, very\r\nnearly all about it! That could not be helped now. After all, it was\r\nMiss Vintry's own fault; she should have done sooner what she had done\r\nnow. \"All the same,\" thought chivalrous Andy, \"I might give Doris a hint\r\nthat things look a good bit better.\"\r\n\r\nCertainly Isobel Vintry had cause to congratulate herself on a useful\r\nmorning's work--Harry safely warned, Andy in great measure conciliated.\r\nShe felt more able to face Wellgood over the teapot.\r\n\r\nThe first round had gone in her favour; the zone of danger was\r\nappreciably contracted. Her courage rose; her conscience, too, was\r\nquieter. She felt comparatively honest. With Wellgood she had gone as\r\nnear to absolute honesty as the circumstances permitted. She had broken\r\nthe engagement; she had even prayed to be allowed to go away, with all\r\nthat meant to her. Wellgood made her stay. Then, so far as he was\r\nconcerned, the issue must be on his own head. If that unexpected answer\r\nshould come in the course of the weeks still left for it, it would be\r\nWellgood's own lookout. As for Vivien--well, she was perceptibly more\r\nhonest even in regard to Vivien. If she fought still, in desperate hope,\r\nfor Vivien's lover, she fought now in fairer fashion, by refusing, not\r\nby accepting, his society, his attentions, his kisses. She would be\r\nnothing to him unless he found himself forced to cry, \"Be everything!\"\r\nShe would abide no longer on that half-way ground; there were to be no\r\nmore sly tricks and secret meetings. The kisses, if kisses came, would\r\nnot be stolen, but ravished in conquest from a rival's lips. If sin,\r\nthat was sin in the grand manner.\r\n\r\nAt lunch-time a note came for Vivien, brought by a groom on a bicycle.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, from Harry!\" she exclaimed, tearing it open.\r\n\r\nIsobel, sitting opposite Wellgood, set her face. She had expected a note\r\nto come for Vivien from Harry. She was on her mettle, fighting warily,\r\nrisking no points. No note should come to her from Harry, to be opened\r\nperhaps under Wellgood's eyes; he had been known to ask to see letters,\r\nin his matter-of-course way assuming that there could be nothing private\r\nin them. Harry's answer to the note Andy delivered was to come to Isobel\r\nthrough Vivien, and to come in terms dictated by Isobel, terms that she\r\nalone would understand. She could always contrive to see Vivien's\r\nletters; generally they were left about.\r\n\r\n\"He's so sorry he can't bring Mr. Foot to tennis with him this\r\nafternoon; they're going to play golf,\" Vivien announced, rather\r\ndisappointed. But she cheered up. \"Oh well, it's rather hot for tennis;\r\nand I shall see him to-night, at dinner at Halton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he say anything else?\" asked Isobel carelessly.\r\n\r\n\"Only that he's bored to death with politics.\" She laughed. \"What's\r\nworrying him, I wonder?\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment Isobel sat with eyes lowered; then she raised them and\r\nlooked across to Wellgood. He was not looking at her; he was carving\r\nbeef. Then it did not matter if her face had changed a little when she\r\nheard that Harry was bored with politics. Neither Wellgood nor Vivien\r\nhad seen any change there might possibly have been in her face.\r\n\r\nThat trivial observation about politics was the answer--the expected\r\nanswer, not that unexpected one. It meant, \"I accept your decision.\"\r\n\r\nOddly enough her first feeling, the one that rose instinctively in her\r\nmind, was of triumph over Wellgood. Had she expressed it with the\r\nprimitive simplicity on which he prided himself, she would have cried,\r\n\"Sold again!\" She had got out of her great peril; she had settled the\r\nwhole thing. He had not scored a single point against her. She had\r\nregained her independence of him, and without cost. There was no longer\r\nanything for him to discover. He had no more rights over her; he had to\r\nrenew his wooing, again to court, to conciliate. He had no way of\r\nfinding out the past; Andy Hayes was safe. The future was again in her\r\nhands. Her smile at Wellgood was serene and confident. She was\r\nretreating in perfect order, after fighting a brilliantly successful\r\nrearguard action.\r\n\r\nEven of the retreat itself she was, for the moment at least, half glad.\r\nFear and longing had so mingled in her dreams of that unexpected answer.\r\nTo be free from that crisis and that revelation! They would have meant\r\nflight for her, pursued by a chorus of condemning voices. They would\r\nhave meant at least days, perhaps weeks, of straining vigilance, of\r\nharrowing suspense--never sure of her ground, never sure of herself;\r\nabove all, never sure of Harry. Who, if not she, should know that you\r\nnever could be sure of Harry? Who, if not she, should know that neither\r\nhis plighted word nor his hottest impulse could be relied upon to last?\r\nYes, she was--half glad; almost more than half glad, when she looked at\r\nVivien. In the back of her mind, save maybe when passion ran at full\r\nflood for those rare minutes, the stolen ten that had come for so few\r\ndays, had been the feeling that it would be a terrible thing to be--to\r\nbe \"shown up\" to Vivien. The sage adviser, the firm preceptress, the\r\nmodel of the virtues of self-control--how would she have looked in the\r\neyes of Vivien, even had the open, the triumphant victory come to pass?\r\nReally that hardly bore thinking of, if she had still any self-respect\r\nto lose.\r\n\r\nShe walked alone in the drive after lunch--where she had been wont to\r\nmeet him. Let it all go! At least it had done one thing for her--it had\r\nsaved her from Wellgood. It had taught her love, and made the pretence\r\nof love impossible--the suffering of unwelcome caresses a thing unholy.\r\nThen it was not all to the bad? It left her with a dream, a vision, a\r\nthing unrealized yet real; something to take with her into that new,\r\ncold, unknown world of strange people into which, for a livelihood's\r\nsake, she must soon plunge--must plunge as soon as she had seen Harry\r\nmarried to Vivien!\r\n\r\nThe sun was on the lake that afternoon; the water looked peaceful,\r\nfriendly, consoling. She sat down by the margin of it, and gave herself\r\nto memories. They came thick and fast, repeating themselves endlessly\r\nout of scant material--full of shame, full of woe; but also full of\r\ntriumph, for she had been loved--at least for the time desired--by the\r\nman of her love and desire. Bought at a great cost? Yes. And never ought\r\nto have been bought? No. But now by no means to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nShe was alone; everything was still, in the calm of a September\r\nafternoon. She bowed her head to her hands and wept.\r\n\r\nThe Nun walked up the drive and saw the figure of a woman weeping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII.\r\n\r\nPENITENCE AND PROBLEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nun stopped, walked on a few paces, came to a stand again. She was\r\nvisiting Nutley in pursuance of her plan of doing, if not that\r\nundiscoverable obvious, yet the more sensible thing--of preventing the\r\n\"row\" and, incidentally thereto, of finding out \"what the woman really\r\nwanted.\"\r\n\r\nHere was the woman. Whatever she might really want, apparently she was\r\nvery far from having got it yet. She also looked very different from the\r\nadversary with whom Miss Flower had pictured herself as conducting a\r\ncontest of wits--quite unlike the cool, wary, dexterous woman who had\r\nplayed her difficult game between the two men so finely, and who might\r\nbe trusted to treat her opponent to a very pretty display of fencing.\r\nThe position seemed so changed that the Nun had thoughts of going back.\r\nTo discover a new, and what one has considered rather a hostile,\r\nacquaintance in tears is embarrassing; and the acquaintance may well\r\nshare the embarrassment.\r\n\r\nFortunately Isobel stopped crying. She dried her eyes and tucked away\r\nher handkerchief. The Nun advanced again. Isobel sat looking drearily\r\nover the lake.\r\n\r\n\"Dropped your sixpence in the pond, Miss Vintry?\" the Nun asked.\r\n\r\nIsobel turned round sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Because--I mean--you're not looking very cheerful.\"\r\n\r\nIsobel's eyes hardened a little.\r\n\r\n\"Have you been there long?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw you were crying, if that's what you mean. I'm sorry. I couldn't\r\nhelp it. People should cry in their own rooms if they want to keep it\r\nquiet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, never mind; it doesn't matter whether you saw or not. Every woman\r\nis entitled to cry sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't cry myself,\" observed the Nun, \"but of course a great many\r\ngirls do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I daresay I shouldn't cry if I were the great Miss Doris Flower.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun gurgled. That ebullition could usually be brought about by any\r\nreference to the greatness of her position, not precisely because the\r\nposition was not great--rather because it was funny that it should be.\r\nShe sat down beside Isobel.\r\n\r\n\"Please don't tell Vivien what you saw. I don't want her to know I've\r\nbeen crying. She's remorseful enough as it is about her marriage costing\r\nme my 'place.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Was that what you were crying about?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems silly, doesn't it? But I've been happy here, and--and they've\r\ngot fond of me. And finding a new one--well, it seems like plunging into\r\nthis lake on a cold day. So quite suddenly I got terribly dreary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you've had it out, haven't you?\" suggested the Nun consolingly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and much good it's done to the situation!\" laughed Isobel\r\nruefully. \"Oh, well, I suppose my feelings are the situation--at any\r\nrate there's no other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then if you feel better, things are better too.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun did not feel that she was getting on much with the secret object\r\nof her visit; she even felt the impulse to get on with it weakened. She\r\nwas more inclined just to have a friendly, a consoling chat. However\r\nbusiness was business. To get on she must take a little risk. She dug\r\nthe earth on the edge of the pond with the point of her sunshade and\r\nobserved carelessly, \"If you very particularly wanted to stay at Nutley,\r\nI should have thought you might have the chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, are people gossiping about that? Poor Mr. Wellgood!\"\r\n\r\n\"It was the observation of my own eyes,\" said the Nun sedately. \"Oh, of\r\ncourse you can deny it if you like, though I don't see why you\r\nshould--and I shan't believe you.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you've such confidence in your own eyes as that, Miss Flower, it\r\nwould be wasting my breath to try to convince you. Have it your own way.\r\nBut even that would be--a new place. And I've told you that I'm afraid\r\nof new places.\"\r\n\r\n\"All plunges aren't into cold water,\" the Nun observed reflectively.\r\n\r\n\"That one would be colder, I think, than a quite strange plunge--away\r\nfrom Nutley.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a great pity we're not built so as to fall in love conveniently.\r\nIt would have been so nice for you to stay--in the new place.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm only letting you have it your own way, Miss Flower. I've admitted\r\nnothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"All that appears at present is that you needn't go if you don't\r\nlike--and yet you cry about going!\"\r\n\r\nIsobel smiled.\r\n\r\n\"I might cry at leaving all my friends, especially at leaving Vivien,\r\nwithout wanting to stop--with Mr. Wellgood, as you insist on having it.\r\nIs that comprehensible?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I expect I've asked enough questions,\" said the cunning Nun,\r\nwondering hard how she could contrive to ask another--and get an answer\r\nto it. \"But in Meriton there's nothing to do but gossip to and about\r\none's friends. That's what makes it so jolly. Why, this wedding is\r\nsimply occupation for all of us! What shall we do when it's over? Oh,\r\nwell, I shall be gone, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so shall I--so we needn't trouble about that.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun was baffled. A strange impassivity seemed to fall on her\r\ncompanion the moment that the talk was of Harry's wedding. She tried\r\nonce again.\r\n\r\n\"I do hope it'll turn out well.\"\r\n\r\nIsobel offered no comment whatever. In truth she was not sure of\r\nherself; her agitation was too recent and had been too violent--it might\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n\"I've known Harry for so long--and I like Miss Wellgood so much.\" She\r\ngave as interrogative a note as she could to her remarks--without asking\r\ndirect questions. \"I think he really is in love at last!\" Surely, that\r\nought to draw some question or remark--that \"at last\"? It drew nothing.\r\n\"But--well, we used to say one never knew with poor Harry!\" (\"Further\r\nthan that,\" thought the Nun, \"without telling tales, I cannot go.\")\r\n\r\nIsobel sat silent.\r\n\r\nThe result was meagre. Isobel would talk about Wellgood, evasively but\r\nwithout embarrassment; references to Harry Belfield reduced her to\r\nsilence. It was a little new light on the past; its bearing on the\r\nfuture, if any, was negative. She would not, it seemed, stay at Nutley\r\nwith Wellgood. She would not talk of Harry. She had been crying. The\r\ncrying was the satisfactory feature in the case.\r\n\r\nThe Nun rose.\r\n\r\n\"I must go in and see Miss Wellgood.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's gone out with her father, I'm afraid. That's how I happen to be\r\noff duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"And able to cry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I hope you'll forget that nonsense. I'm quite resigned to\r\neverything, really.\" She too rose, smiling at her companion. \"Only I\r\nrather wish it was all over--and the plunge made!\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun reported the fact of her interview--and the results, such as\r\nthey were--to Miss Dutton when she returned home.\r\n\r\n\"Her crying shows that she doesn't think she's got much chance,\" said\r\nthe Nun hopefully.\r\n\r\n\"It shows she'd take a chance, if she got one,\" Miss Dutton opined\r\nacutely.\r\n\r\n\"You mean it all depends on Harry, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"In my opinion it always has.\"\r\n\r\nThat indeed seemed the net result. It all depended on Harry--not at\r\nfirst sight a very satisfactory conclusion for those who knew Harry.\r\nHowever, Andy, who came into the Lion later in the afternoon, was\r\nhopeful--nay, confident. He had mysterious reasons for this frame of\r\nmind--information which he declared himself unable to disclose; he could\r\nnot even indicate the source from which it proceeded, but he might say\r\nthat there were two sources. He really could not say more--which annoyed\r\nthe Nun extremely.\r\n\r\n\"But I think we may consider all the trouble over,\" he ended.\r\n\r\nFor had not Harry, when he got his note, dealt quite frankly with\r\nAndy--well, with very considerable frankness as to the past, with\r\ncomplete as to the future? He admitted that he had \"more or less made a\r\nfool of himself,\" but declared that it had been mere nonsense, and was\r\naltogether over. Absolutely done with! He gave Andy his hand on that,\r\nbegged his pardon for having been sulky with him, and told him that\r\nhenceforward all his thoughts would be where his heart had been all\r\nthrough--with Vivien. If Isobel had convinced Andy, Harry convinced him\r\nten times more. Andy had such a habit of believing people. He was not,\r\nindeed, easily or stupidly deceived by a wilful liar; but he fell a\r\nvictim to people who believed in themselves, who thought they were\r\ntelling the truth. It was so hard for him to understand that people\r\nwould not go on feeling and meaning what they were sincerely feeling and\r\nmeaning at the moment. They could convince him, if only they were\r\nconvinced themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Let's think no more about it, and then we can all be happy,\" he said to\r\nthe Nun. It really made a great difference to his happiness how Harry\r\nwas behaving.\r\n\r\nAfter all, it was rather hard--and rather hard-hearted--not to believe\r\nin Harry, when Harry believed so thoroughly in himself. The strongest\r\nproof of his regained self-confidence was the visit he paid to the\r\nNun--a visit long overdue in friendship and even in courtesy. Harry\r\nasked for no forgiveness; he seemed to assume that she would understand\r\nhow, having been troubled in his mind of late, he had not been in the\r\nmood for visits. He was quite his old self when he came, so much his old\r\nself that he scarcely cared to disguise the fact that he had given some\r\ncause for anxiety--any more than he expected to be met with doubt when\r\nhe implied that all cause for anxiety was past. He had quite got over\r\nthat attack, and his constitution was really the stronger for it.\r\nIllnesses are nature's curative processes, so the doctors tell us. Harry\r\nwas always more virtuous after a moral seizure. The seizure being the\r\neffective cause of his improvement, he could not be expected to regard\r\nit with unmixed regret. If, incidentally, it witnessed to his conquering\r\ncharms, he could not help that. Of course he would not talk about the\r\nthing; he did not so much mind other people implying, assuming, or\r\nhinting at it.\r\n\r\nIf the Nun obliged him at all in this way, she chose the difficult\r\nmethod of irony--in which not her greatest admirer could claim that she\r\nwas very subtle.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Harry, I quite understand your not calling. How could you think\r\nof me when you were quite wrapped up in Vivien Wellgood? I was really\r\nglad!\"\r\n\r\nNow that Harry had come, he found himself delighted with his visit.\r\n\r\n\"Country air's agreeing with you, Doris. You look splendid.\" His eyes\r\nspoke undisguised admiration.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Harry. I know you thought me good-looking once.\" The Nun was\r\nmeek and grateful.\r\n\r\nHarry laughed, by no means resenting the allusion. That had been an\r\nillness, a curative process, also--though her curative measures had been\r\nrather too summary for his taste.\r\n\r\n\"Whose peace of mind are you destroying down here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've a right to destroy peace of mind if I want to. It's not as if I\r\nwere engaged to be married--as you are. I think Jack Rock's in most\r\ndanger--or perhaps your father.\"\r\n\r\n\"The pater inherits some of my weaknesses,\" said Harry. \"Or shares my\r\ntastes, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know he's devoted to Vivien.\"\r\n\r\n\"You never look prettier than when you're trying to say nasty things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll stop, or in another moment you'll be offering to kiss me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Should you object?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly worth while. It would mean nothing at all to either of us.\r\nStill--I'm not a poacher.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't seem to me to be able to take a joke either.\" Harry's voice\r\nsounded annoyed. \"But we won't quarrel. I've been through one of my fits\r\nof the blues, Doris. Don't be hard on a fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be so much better for you if people could be hard on you,\r\nHarry. Still you'll have to pay for it somehow. We all have to pay for\r\nbeing what we are--somehow. Perhaps you won't know you're paying--you'll\r\ncall it by some other name; perhaps you won't care. But you'll have to\r\npay somehow.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun made a queer figure of a moralist; she was really far too\r\npretty. But her words got home to Harry--the new, the recovered, Harry.\r\n\r\n\"I have paid,\" he said. \"Oh yes, you don't believe it, but I have! The\r\nbill's paid, and receipted. I'm starting fair now. But you never did do\r\nme justice.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've always done justice to what you care most about--Harry the\r\nIrresistible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, stop that rot!\" he implored. \"I'm serious, you know, Doris.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know all the symptoms of your seriousness. The first is wanting to\r\nflirt with somebody fresh.\"\r\n\r\nHarry's laugh was vexed--but not of bitter vexation. \"Give a fellow a\r\nchance!\"\r\n\r\n\"The whole world's in league to do it--again and again!\"\r\n\r\n\"This time the world is going to find me appreciative. You don't know\r\nwhat a splendid girl Vivien is! If you did, you'd understand\r\nhow--how--well, how things look different.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun relented. \"I really think it may last you over the wedding--and\r\nperhaps the honeymoon,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary thing to her--indeed to all his friends who did not\r\nshare his most mercurial temperament--was that this change of mood was\r\nentirely sincere in Harry, and his satisfaction with it not less\r\ngenuine. For two painful hours--from his receipt of Isobel's note to his\r\ndispatching of that sentence about being bored with politics--he had\r\nstruggled, keeping Andy in an adjoining room solaced by newspapers and\r\ntobacco, in case counsel should be needed. Then the right had won--and\r\nall was over! When all was over, it was with Harry exactly as if nothing\r\nhad ever begun; his belief in the virtue of penitence beggared theology\r\nitself. What he had been doing presented itself as not merely finished,\r\nnot merely repented of, but as hardly real; at the most as an\r\naberration, at the least as a delusion. Certainly he felt hardly\r\nresponsible for it. An excellent comfortable doctrine--for Harry. It\r\nrather left out of account the other party to the transaction.\r\n\r\nWhat a right he had to be proud of his return to loyalty! Because Isobel\r\nVintry was really a most attractive girl; it would be unjust and\r\nungrateful to deny that, since she had--well, it was better not to go\r\nback to that! With which reflection he went back to it, recovering some\r\nof the emotions of that culminating evening in the drive; recovering\r\nthem not to any dangerous extent--Isobel was not there, the thrill of\r\nher voice not in his ears, nor the light of her eyes visible through the\r\ndarkness--but enough to make him pat his virtue on the back again, and\r\nagain excuse the aberration. Oh, they had all made too much of it! A\r\nmere flirtation! Oh, very wrong! Yes, yes; or where lay the marvel of\r\nthis repentance? But not so bad as all that! They had been prejudiced to\r\nthink it so serious--prejudiced by Vivien's charms, her trust, her\r\nsimplicity, her appeal. Yes, he certainly had been a villain even to\r\nflirt when engaged to a girl like that. However he thoroughly\r\nappreciated that aspect of the case now; it had needed this\r\nlittle--adventure--to make him appreciate it. Perhaps it had all been\r\nfor the best. Well, that was going too far, because Isobel felt it\r\ndeeply, as her words in the drive had shown. Yet perhaps--Harry achieved\r\nhis climax in the thought that even for her it might have been for the\r\nbest if it stopped her from marrying Wellgood. By how different a path,\r\nin how different a mood, had poor Isobel attained to laying the same\r\nunction to her smarting soul!\r\n\r\nWellgood did not know at all how quickly matters had moved. He was still\r\nasking about the sin--the aberration; he was not up to date with\r\nIsobel's renunciation or Harry's comfortable penitence. Nor was he of\r\nthe school that accepts such things without sound proof. \"Lead us not\r\ninto temptation\" was all very well in church; in secular life, if you\r\nsuspected a servant of dishonesty, you marked a florin and left it on\r\nthe mantelpiece. Had Isobel been already his wife, he would have locked\r\nher up in the nearest approach to a tower of brass that modern\r\nconditions permit; if Vivien had been already Harry's wife, he would no\r\ndoubt have been in favour of Harry's being kept out of the way of\r\ndangerous seductions. But now, whether as father or as lover--and the\r\nfather continued to afford the lover most valuable aid, most specious\r\ncover--he had first to know, to test, and to try. He had to leave his\r\nmarked florin on the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be supposed that Meriton lacked problems because\r\nHarry Belfield seemed, for the moment at all events, to cease to present\r\none. For days past Billy Foot had been grappling with a most momentous\r\none, and Mrs. Belfield's mind was occupied, and almost disturbed, by\r\nanother of equal gravity. Curiously enough, the two related to the same\r\nperson, and were to some degree of a kindred nature. Both involved the\r\nserious question of the social status--or perhaps the social\r\ndesirability would be a better term--of Miss Doris Flower.\r\n\r\nIn the leisure hours and the autumn sunshine of Meriton--an atmosphere\r\nremote from courts, whether of law or of royalty, and inimical to\r\nambition--Billy was in danger of forgetting the paramount claims of his\r\ncareer and of remembering only the remarkable prettiness of Miss Flower.\r\nHe was once more \"on the brink\"; the metaphor of a plunge found a place\r\nin his thoughts as well as in Isobel Vintry's; some metaphors are very\r\nmaids-of-all-work. He was deplorably perturbed. Now that the great\r\ncampaign was over he abandoned himself to the great question. He even\r\nwent up to London to talk it over with Gilly, entertaining his brother\r\nto lunch--by no means a casual or haphazard hospitality, for Gilly's\r\nmeals were serious business--in order to obtain his most inspired\r\ncounsel. But Gilly had been abominably, nay, cruelly disappointing.\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't waste any more time thinking about that, old chap,\" said\r\nGilly, delicately dissecting a young partridge.\r\n\r\n\"You're not going out of your way to be flattering. It appears to me at\r\nleast to be a matter of some importance whom I marry. I thought perhaps\r\nmy brother might take that view too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I do, old chap. I know it's devilish important to you. All I mean\r\nis that in this particular case you needn't go about weighing the\r\nquestion. Ask the Nun right off.\"\r\n\r\n\"You really advise it?\" Billy demanded, wrinkling his brow in judicial\r\ngravity, but inwardly rather delighted.\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" Gilly rejoined. \"Ask her right off--get it off your mind! It\r\ndoesn't matter a hang, because she's sure to refuse you.\" He smiled at\r\nhis brother across the table--a table spread by that brother's\r\nbounty--in a fat and comfortable fashion.\r\n\r\nBilly preserved his temper with some difficulty. \"Purely for the sake of\r\nargument, assume that I am a person whom she might possibly accept.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't. There are limits to hypothesis, beyond which discussion is\r\nunprofitable. I merely ask you to note how much time and worry you'll be\r\nsaved if you adopt my suggestion.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll look a particular fool if I do--and she says yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you quite sure they brought the claret you ordered, Billy?--What's\r\nthat you said?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure it's the claret, and I'm sure you're an idiot!\" Billy crossly\r\nretorted.\r\n\r\nHis journey to London, to say nothing of a decidedly expensive lunch,\r\nbrought poor Billy no comfort and no enlightenment, since he refused his\r\nbrother's plan without hesitation. His problem became no less harassing\r\nwhen brought into contact with Mrs. Belfield's problem at Halton. She\r\nalso discussed it at lunch, Harry being an absentee, and Andy Hayes the\r\nonly other guest. She had forgotten by now that a similar question had\r\nonce arisen about Andy himself; his present position would have made the\r\nmemory seem ridiculous; it had become indisputably equal to dinner at\r\nHalton, even in Mrs. Belfield's most conservative eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I have written the note you wished me to, my dear,\" she remarked to her\r\nhusband. \"To Miss Flower, you know, for Wednesday night. And I\r\napologized for my informality in not having called, and said that I\r\nhoped Miss--Miss--well, the friend, you know, would come too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, my dear, thank you.\" Belfield sounded really grateful; the\r\nstruggle had, in fact, been rather more severe than he had anticipated.\r\n\r\n\"It's not that I'm a snob,\" the lady went on, now addressing herself to\r\nBilly Foot, \"or prejudiced, or in any way illiberal. Nobody could say\r\nthat of me. But it's just that I doubt how far it's wise to attempt to\r\nmix different sections of society. I mean whether there's not a certain\r\ndanger in it. You see what I mean, Mr. Foot?\"\r\n\r\nBelfield winked covertly at Andy; both had some suspicion of Billy's\r\nfeelings, and were maliciously enjoying the situation.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, Mrs. Belfield, I--er--see what you mean, of course. In ordinary\r\ncases there might be--yes--a sort of--well, a sort of danger\r\nto--to--well, to something we all value, Mrs. Belfield. But in this case\r\nI don't think--\"\r\n\r\n\"So Mr. Belfield says. But then he's always so adventurous.\"\r\n\r\nBelfield could not repress a snigger; Andy made an unusually prolonged\r\nuse of his napkin; Billy was rather red in the face. Mrs. Belfield gazed\r\nat Billy, not at all understanding his feelings, but thinking that he\r\nwas looking very warm.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Harry's engaged!\" she added with a sigh of thanksgiving. Billy\r\ngrew redder still; the other two welcomed an opportunity for open\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\"They may laugh, Mr. Foot, but I'm sure your mother would feel as I do.\"\r\n\r\nA bereavement several years old saved Billy from the suggested\r\ncomplication, but he glared fiercely across the table at Andy, who\r\nassumed, with difficulty, an apologetic gravity.\r\n\r\n\"All my wife's fears will vanish as soon as she knows the lady,\" said\r\nBelfield, also anxious to make his peace with Billy.\r\n\r\n\"I always yield to Mr. Belfield, but you can't deny that it's an\r\nexperiment, Mr. Foot.\" She rose from the table, having defined the\r\nposition with her usual serene and gentle self-satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBilly rose too, announcing that he would finish his cigar in the garden.\r\nHis face was still red, and he was not well pleased with his host and\r\nAndy. Why will people make our own most reasonable thoughts ridiculous\r\nby their silly way of putting them? And why will other stupid people\r\nlaugh at them when so presented? These reflections accompanied poor\r\nBilly as he walked and smoked.\r\n\r\nBelfield smiled. \"More sentimental complications! I hope Billy Foot\r\nkeeps his face better than that when he's in court. Do you think he'll\r\nrush on his fate? And what will it be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know, sir,\" Andy answered. \"I really haven't thought about\r\nit. I don't think she cares for him in that sort of way, though they're\r\nawfully good friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to manage to keep heart-whole, Andy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I've no time to do anything else,\" he laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Take care; Cupid resents defiance. I've a notion you stand very well\r\nwith the lady in question yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I? Oh, the idea's never entered my head.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't say it's entered hers. The pretty rogue told me she never fell\r\nin love, and made me wish I was thirty years younger, and free to test\r\nher. But she's very fond of you, Andy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think what she told you about herself is true. She said something\r\nlike it to me too. But I'm glad you think she likes me. I like her\r\nimmensely. Outside this house, she's my best friend, I think, not\r\ncounting old Jack Rock, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe Vivien would dispute the title with her. She thinks the world\r\nof you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Mr. Belfield, you'll turn my head. Seriously, I should be\r\nawfully happy to think that true. There's nobody--well, nobody in the\r\nworld I'd rather be liked by.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think I know that,\" said Belfield. \"And I'm glad to think she's\r\ngot such a friend, if she ever needs one.\"\r\n\r\nA silence followed. Belfield was thinking of Vivien, thinking that she\r\nwould have been in safer hands with Andy than with his son Harry; glad,\r\nas he had said, to know that she would have such a friend left to her\r\nafter his own precarious lease of life was done. Andy was thinking too,\r\nbut not of Vivien, not of sentimental complications--not even of\r\nHarry's. Yet the thought which he was pursuing in his mind was not\r\naltogether out of relation to Harry, though the relation was one that he\r\ndid not consciously trace.\r\n\r\n\"Back to work next week, sir!\" he said. \"Gilly's clamouring for me. I've\r\nhad a splendid holiday.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've put in some very good work in your holiday. Your speeches are\r\nthought good.\"\r\n\r\n\"I somehow feel that I'm on my own legs now,\" said Andy slowly. \"I hope\r\nI've not grown bumptious, but I'm not afraid now to think for myself and\r\nto say what I think. I often find people agree with me more or less.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you persuade them,\" Belfield suggested; he was listening with\r\ninterest, for he had watched from outside the growth of Andy's mind, and\r\nliked to hear Andy's own account of it.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I never set out to do that. I just give them the facts, and what\r\nthe facts seem to me to point to. If they've got facts pointing the\r\nother way, I like to listen. Of course lots of questions are very\r\ndifficult, but by going at it like that, and taking time, and not being\r\nafraid to chuck up your first opinion, you can get forward--or so it\r\nseems to me at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chucking up first opinions is hard work, both about things and about\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but it's the way a man's mind grows, isn't it?\" He spoke slowly\r\nand thoughtfully. \"Unless you can do that, you're not really your own\r\nmental master, any more than you're your own physical master if you\r\ncan't break off a bad habit.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got to be a bit ruthless with yourself in both cases, and with\r\nthe opinions, and--with the people.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got to see,\" said Andy. \"You must see--that's it. You mustn't\r\nshut your eyes, or turn your head away, or let anybody else look for\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've come into your kingdom,\" said Belfield with a nod.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I may claim to have got my eyes open, to be grown up.\"\r\n\r\nHe was grown up; he stood on his own legs; he sat no more at Harry's\r\nfeet and leant no more on Harry's arm. Harry came into his life there,\r\nas he had in so many ways. Harry's weakness had thrown him back on his\r\nown strength, and forced him to rely on it. Relying on it in life, he\r\nhad found it trustworthy, and now did not fear to rely on it in thought\r\nalso. His chosen master and leader had forfeited his allegiance, though\r\nnever his love. He would choose no other; he would think for himself.\r\nLooking at his capacious head, at his calm broad brow, and hearing him\r\nslowly hammer out his mental creed, Belfield fancied that his thinking\r\nmight carry him far. The kingdom he had come into might prove a spacious\r\nrealm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX.\r\n\r\nMARKED MONEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as she could and dared, Isobel Vintry withdrew herself from the\r\ncompany of Harry Belfield. She relaxed her supervision of the lovers\r\nwhen they were together; she tried to avoid any risk of being alone with\r\nHarry. She knew that Wellgood was watching her, and was determined to\r\ngive no new handle to his suspicion. Her own feelings agreed in\r\ndictating her line of action. In ordinary intercourse she was sure of\r\nherself; she was not anxious to seek extraordinary temptation. She had\r\nmore resolution than Harry, but not the same power of self-delusion, not\r\nthe same faculty of imagining that an enemy was finally conquered\r\nbecause he had been once defeated or defied. She was careful not to\r\nexpose herself to danger, either from herself or from Wellgood. Harry\r\nhad decided that all chance of danger was over; he laughed at it now,\r\nalmost literally laughed. Yet while he derided the notion of peril, he\r\nliked the flavour of memory. He kept turning the thing over in a mood\r\nnicely compounded of remorse and self-esteem; of penitence for the\r\nfolly, and self-congratulation over the end that had been put to it; of\r\nwonder at his aberration, and excuse of it in view of Isobel's\r\nattractions. Gone as it all was in fact, it was not banished from\r\nretrospect.\r\n\r\nWellgood grew easier in his mind. He had marked some\r\nflorins--opportunities for private meetings rather clumsily offered;\r\nthey had not been taken. His suspicions of the past remained, but he\r\nthought that he had effectually frightened Isobel. He had good hopes for\r\nhis own scheme again. If she did not come round before the wedding--now\r\nonly a fortnight off--he believed that she would afterwards. Harry\r\nfinally out of reach, his turn would come. He continued his smoothness,\r\nand did not relax his vigilance; but, as the days passed by, his hopes\r\nrose to confidence again.\r\n\r\nThe dinner-party at Halton in the Nun's honour went off with great\r\nsuccess; she comported herself with such decorum and ease that Mrs.\r\nBelfield felt her problem solved, while Billy Foot found his even more\r\npressing. Vivien was the only representative of Nutley. Wellgood had\r\ngone to the county town to attend a meeting of the County Council; the\r\ntrains ran awkwardly, and, unless the business proved very brief, he\r\nwould have to dine at the hotel, and would not reach home till late at\r\nnight. Isobel had excused herself, pursuant to her policy of seeing as\r\nlittle as possible of Harry. But the party was reinforced by Gilly Foot,\r\nwho had come down for a couple of days' rest, and was staying at the\r\nLion--the great publishing house being left to take care of itself for\r\nthis short space.\r\n\r\nThe party was pleasant--Belfield flirting with the Nun, Gilly\r\ndiscoursing in company with Mrs. Belfield, who thought him a most\r\nintelligent young man (as he was), Harry and Billy both in high spirits\r\nand full of sallies, for which Vivien and Andy, both ever choosing the\r\nmodest _role_, made an applauding audience. Yet for most of the company\r\ndinner was but a prelude to the real business of the evening. The Nun\r\nhad no opinion of evenings which ended at ten-thirty. For this reason,\r\nand in order to welcome Gilly and, if possible, please his palate, she\r\nhad organized a supper at the Lion, and exhorted Mr. Dove, and Chinks,\r\nand the cook--in a word, everybody concerned--to a great effort. One\r\nthing only marred the anticipations of this feast; Vivien had failed to\r\nwin leave to attend it.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want with supper after a good dinner?\" asked Wellgood\r\nbrusquely. \"Come home and go to bed, like a sensible girl.\"\r\n\r\nSo Harry was to take Vivien home, and come back to supper with all\r\nreasonable speed. The Nun pressed Mr. Belfield to join her party after\r\nhis own was over, but gained nothing thereby, save a disquisition on the\r\npleasures appropriate to youth and age respectively. \"Among the latter I\r\nrank going early to bed very high.\"\r\n\r\n\"Going to bed early is a low calculating sort of thing to do,\" said\r\nHarry. \"It always means that you intend to try to take advantage of\r\nsomebody else the next morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the hope that he'll have been up late,\" said Billy.\r\n\r\n\"And eaten too much,\" added Gilly sadly.\r\n\r\n\"Or even drunk too much?\" suggested Belfield.\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow, being sent to bed is horrid,\" lamented unhappy Vivien.\r\n\r\n\"You've a life of suppers before you, if you choose,\" Billy assured her\r\nconsolingly.\r\n\r\n\"When I was a girl, we always had supper,\" said Mrs. Belfield.\r\n\r\n\"Quite right, Mrs. Belfield,\" said Gilly, in high approval.\r\n\r\n\"Instead of late dinner, I mean, Mr. Foot.\"\r\n\r\nGilly could do no more than look at her, finding no adequate comment.\r\n\r\n\"Supper should be a mere flirtation with one's food,\" said Billy.\r\n\r\n\"A post-matrimonial flirtation?\" asked Belfield. \"Because dinner must be\r\nwedlock! We come back to its demoralizing character.\"\r\n\r\n\"Having established that it's wrong, we've given it the final charm, and\r\nwe'll go and do it,\" laughed Billy. Mrs. Belfield had already looked\r\nonce at the clock.\r\n\r\nAmid much merriment Vivien and Harry were put into the Nutley brougham,\r\nand the rest started to walk to the Lion, no more than half a mile from\r\nthe gates of Halton. Belfield turned back into the house, smiling and\r\nshaking his head. The old, old moralizing was upon him again, in its\r\nhoary antiquity, its eternal power of striking the mind afresh. How good\r\nit all is--and how short! Elderly he said good-night to his elderly\r\nwife, and in elderly fashion packed himself off to bed. He was \"sent\"\r\nthere under a sanction stronger, more ruthless, less to be evaded, than\r\nthat which poor Vivien reluctantly obeyed. He chid himself; nobody but a\r\npoet has a right to abandon his mind to universal inevitable regrets,\r\nsince only a poet's hand can fashion a fresh garland for the tomb of\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nHalf Harry's charm lay in--perhaps half his dangers sprang from--an\r\ninstinctive adaptability; he was seldom out of tune with his company.\r\nWith the bold he was bold; towards the timid he displayed a chivalrous\r\nreserve. This latter had always been his bearing towards Vivien, even in\r\nthe early days of impulsive single-hearted devotion. It did not desert\r\nhim even to-night, although there was a stirring in his blood, roused\r\nperhaps by the mimic reproduction of old-time gaieties with which the\r\nNun proposed to enliven Meriton--a spirit of riot and revolt, of risk\r\nand adventure in the realm of feeling. He had little prospect of\r\nsatisfying that impulse, but he might find some solace in merry revelry\r\nwith his friends. Somehow, when more closely considered, the revelry did\r\nnot satisfy. Good-fellowship was not what his mood was asking; for him\r\nat least the entertainment at the Lion offered no more, whatever tinge\r\nof romance might adorn it for Billy Foot.\r\n\r\nBut he talked gaily to Vivien as they drove to Nutley--of the trip they\r\nwere to make, of the house they were to hire for the winter and the\r\nensuing season (he would in all likelihood be in Parliament by then), of\r\ntheir future life together. There was no woman save Vivien in his mind,\r\nneither Isobel nor another. He had no doubts of his recovered loyalty;\r\nbut he was in some danger of recognizing it ruefully, as obligation and\r\nnecessity, rather than as satisfaction or even as achievement.\r\n\r\nVivien had grown knowing about him. She knew when she, or something, or\r\nthings in general, did not satisfy his mood. \"I'm glad you're going to\r\nhave a merry evening to-night,\" she said. \"And I'm almost glad I'm sent\r\nto bed! It'll do you good to forget all about me for a few hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think I shall?\" he protested gallantly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes!\" she answered, laughing. \"But I shall expect you to be all the\r\nmore glad to see me again to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed rather absently. \"I expect those fellows will rather wake up\r\nthe old Lion.\"\r\n\r\nThey had passed through Nutley gates and were in the drive. Harry was\r\nnext to the water, and turned his head to look at it. Suddenly he gave\r\nthe slightest start, then looked quickly round at his companion. She was\r\nleaning back, she had not looked out of the window. Harry frowned and\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\nWhen they stopped at the door, the coachman said, \"Beg pardon, sir, but\r\nI've only just time to take you back, and then go on to the station to\r\nmeet Mr. Wellgood. He didn't come by the eight-o'clock, so I must meet\r\nthe eleven-thirty.\"\r\n\r\nFor one moment Harry considered. \"All right. I'll walk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir. I'll start directly and take the mare down quietly.\"\r\nThe station lay on the other side of Meriton, two miles and a half from\r\nNutley. The man drove off.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Harry, you might as well have driven, because I daren't ask you in!\r\nFather's not back, and Isobel is sure to have gone to bed.\" The rules\r\nwere still strict at Nutley.\r\n\r\nFor a moment again Harry seemed to consider. \"I thought a walk would do\r\nme good. I may even be able to eat some supper!\" he said with a laugh.\r\n\"I shall get you into trouble if I come in, shall I? Then I won't.\r\nGood-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father won't be here for an hour, nearly--but he might ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you're incorrigibly truthful!\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I? Anyhow I rather think you want to go back to supper.\"\r\n\r\nShe would have yielded him admission--risking her father's questions and\r\nperhaps her own answer to them--if he had pressed. Harry did not press;\r\nin his refraining she saw renewed evidence of his chivalry. She gave him\r\nher cheek to kiss; he kissed it lightly, saying, \"Till to-morrow--what\r\nthere's left of me after a night of dissipation!\"\r\n\r\nShe opened the door with her key, waved a last good-night to him, and\r\ndisappeared into the dimly lighted hall.\r\n\r\nShe was gone; the carriage was gone; Wellgood would not come for nearly\r\nan hour. Harry had not told what he had seen in the drive, nor disputed\r\nVivien's assurance that Isobel Vintry would have gone to bed. Chance had\r\nput a marked florin on the mantelpiece for Wellgood; what were the\r\nchances of its being stolen, and of the theft being traced?\r\n\r\nTo have moods is to be exposed to chances. Many moods come and go\r\nharmlessly--free, at least, from external consequences. Sometimes\r\nopportunity comes pat on the mood, and the mood is swift to lay all the\r\nblame on opportunity.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's not my fault this time,\" thought Harry. \"And if I meet her,\r\nI can hardly walk by without saying good-night.\"\r\n\r\nThe little adventure, with its sentimental background, had just the\r\nflavour that his spirit had been asking, just what the evening lacked. A\r\nbrief scene of reserved feeling, more hinted than said, a becoming word\r\nof sorrow, and so farewell! No harm in that, and, under the\r\ncircumstances, less from Harry would be hardly decent.\r\n\r\nIsobel did not seem minded even for so much. She came up to him with a\r\nquick resolute step. She wore a low-cut black gown, and a black lace\r\nscarf twisted round her neck. She bent her head slightly, saying,\r\n\"Good-night, Mr. Harry.\"\r\n\r\nHe stepped up to her, holding out his hand, but she made no motion to\r\ntake it.\r\n\r\n\"I've no key--I'll go in by the back door. It's sure to be open, because\r\nFellowes is up, waiting for Mr. Wellgood.\"\r\n\r\n\"He won't be here for ever so long. Won't you give me just three\r\nminutes?\"\r\n\r\nThe lamp over the hall door showed him her face; it was pale and tense,\r\nher lips were parted.\r\n\r\n\"I think I'd sooner go in at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to know that I didn't send that answer lightly. It--it\r\nwasn't easy to obey you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please don't let us say a single word more about it. If you have any\r\nfeeling, any consideration for me, you'll let me go at once.\"\r\n\r\nThe moment was a bad one for her too. She had spent an evening alone\r\nwith bitter thoughts; she had strolled out in a miserable restlessness.\r\nSeeing the carriage pass, feeling sure that Harry was in it, she had\r\nfirst thought that she would hide herself till he had gone, then decided\r\nto try to reach the house before he had parted from Vivien. Her wavering\r\nlanded her there at the one wrong minute.\r\n\r\nHarry glanced up at the house; every window was dark. Vivien's room\r\nlooked over the lake, the servants' quarters to the back. There was\r\ndanger, of course; somebody might come; but nobody was there to see now.\r\nThe danger was enough to incite, not enough to deter. And what he had to\r\nsay was very short.\r\n\r\n\"I only want to tell you how deeply sorry I am, and to ask you to\r\nforgive me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's soon said--and soon answered. I forgive you, if I have anything\r\nto forgive.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice was very low, it broke and trembled on the last words of the\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n\"I had lost the right to love you, and I hadn't the courage to regain my\r\nfreedom, with all that meant to--to poor Vivien and--others. But at\r\nleast I was sincere. I didn't pretend--\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, please!\" Her tones sank to a whisper; he strained forward to\r\ncatch it. \"Have some mercy on me, Harry!\"\r\n\r\nThe old exultation and the old recklessness seized on him. He suffered a\r\nvery intoxication of the senses. Her strength made weakness, her\r\nstateliness turned to trembling for his sake--the spectacle swept away\r\nhis good resolves as the wind blows the loose petals from a fading rose.\r\nSpringing forward, he tried to grasp her hands. She put them behind her\r\nback, and stood thus, her face upturned to his, her eyes set on him\r\nintently. He spoke in a low hoarse voice.\r\n\r\n\"I can't stand any more of it. I've tried and tried. I love Vivien in a\r\nway, and I hate to hurt her. And I hate all the fuss too. But I can't do\r\nit any more. You're the girl for me, Isobel! It comes home to me--right\r\nhome--every time I see you. Let's face it--it'll soon be over! A minute\r\nwith you is worth an hour with her. I tell you I love you, Isobel.\" He\r\nstooped suddenly and kissed the upturned lips.\r\n\r\n\"You think that to-night. You won't to-morrow. The--the other side of it\r\nwill come back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Face the other side with me, and I can stand it. You love me--you know\r\nyou do!\"\r\n\r\nThe trees swayed, murmured, and creaked under the wind; the water lapped\r\non the edge of the lake. The footsteps of a man walking up the drive\r\npassed unheard by the engrossed lovers. The man came to where he could\r\nsee their figures. A sudden stop; then he glided into the cover of the\r\nbushes which fringed the lake, and began to crawl cautiously and\r\nnoiselessly towards the house. To save Wellgood from kicking his heels\r\nfor an idle hour after dinner in the hotel, and again for an idle\r\nhalf-hour at the station where he had to change, Lord Meriton had\r\nperformed, at the cost of a _detour_ of seven or eight miles, the\r\nfriendly office of bringing his colleague home in his motor-car. It is\r\nto little accidents like this that impetuous lovers are exposed. So\r\nnatural when they have happened--this thing had even happened once\r\nbefore--so unlikely to be thought of beforehand, they are indeed florins\r\nmarked by the cunning hand of chance.\r\n\r\nIsobel made no effort to deny Harry's challenge.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I love you, and you know it. If I didn't, I should be the most\r\ntreacherous creature on earth, and the worst! Even as it is, I've\r\nnothing to boast about. But I love you, and if there were no to-morrow\r\nI'd do anything you wish or ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no to-morrow now; it will always be like to-night.\" He bent\r\nagain and softly kissed her.\r\n\r\n\"I daren't think so, Harry! I daren't believe it.\" Unconsciously she\r\nraised her voice in a little wail. The words reached Wellgood, where he\r\nwas now crouching behind a bush. He dared come no nearer, lest they\r\nshould hear his movements.\r\n\r\nHarry had lost all hold on himself now. The pale image of Vivien was\r\nobliterated from his mind. He had no doubt about to-morrow--how had he\r\never doubted?--and he pleaded his cause with a passion eloquent and\r\ninfectious. It was hard to meet passion like that with denial and doubt;\r\nsorely hard when belief would bring such joy and triumph!\r\n\r\n\"If you do think so to-morrow--\" She slowly put her hands out to him, a\r\nhappy tremulous smile on her face.\r\n\r\nBut before he could take her to his arms, a rapid change came into her\r\neyes. She held up a hand in warning. The handle of the door had turned.\r\nBoth faced round, the door opened, and Vivien looked out.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there you are, Isobel!\" she exclaimed in a tone of relief. \"I\r\ncouldn't think what had become of you. I went into your room to tell you\r\nabout the dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw the carriage pass as I was strolling in the drive, but when I got\r\nto the door you'd gone in.\" Her voice shook a little, but her face was\r\nnow composed.\r\n\r\n\"It's my fault. I kept Miss Vintry talking on the doorstep.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must go in now,\" said Isobel. \"Good-night, Mr. Harry.\"\r\n\r\nVivien looked at them in some curiosity, but without any suspicion. A\r\nthought struck her. \"I believe I caught you talking about me,\" she said\r\nwith a laugh. \"And not much good about me either--because you both look\r\na little flustered.\"\r\n\r\nWellgood stepped out from behind his bush.\r\n\r\n\"I think I can tell you what they've been talking about, Vivien, and I\r\nwill. I've had the pleasure of listening to the last part of it.\"\r\n\r\nHe stood there stern and threatening, struggling to keep within bounds\r\nthe rage that nearly mastered him--the rage of the deceived lover trying\r\nstill to masquerade as a father's indignation. The father should have\r\nsent his daughter away; the lover was minded at all costs to heap shame\r\nand humiliation on his favoured rival and on the woman who had deceived\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Not before Vivien!\" Harry cried impulsively.\r\n\r\nVivien turned eyes of wonder on him for a moment, then the old look of\r\nremoteness settled on her face. She stood holding on to the door, for\r\nsupport perhaps, looking now at none of them, looking out into the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\"This man, your lover, was making love to this woman, whom I employed to\r\nlook after you.\" He laughed scornfully. \"Oh yes, a rare fool I look! But\r\ndon't they look fools too? They're nicely caught at last. I daresay\r\nthey've had a good run, a lot of 'I love you's,' a lot of kisses like\r\nthe one I saw to-night. But they're caught at last.\"\r\n\r\nVivien spoke in a low voice. \"Is it true, Isobel?\" For Harry she had\r\nneither words nor eyes.\r\n\r\n\"It's true,\" said Isobel; now her voice was calm. \"There's no use saying\r\nanything about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you let him do it!\" cried Wellgood, his voice rising in passion.\r\n\"You her friend, you her guardian, you who--\" His words seemed nearly to\r\nchoke him. He turned his fury on to Harry. \"You scoundrel, you shall pay\r\nfor this! I'll make Meriton too hot to hold you! You try to swagger\r\nabout this place as you've been doing, you try to open your mouth in\r\npublic, and I'll be there with this pretty story! I'll make an end of\r\nyour chances in Meriton! You shall find out what it is to make a fool of\r\nMark Wellgood! Yes, you shall pay for it!\"\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning Harry had found nothing to say; what was there? His\r\nface was sunk in a dull despair, his eyes set on the ground. He shrugged\r\nhis shoulders now, murmuring hoarsely, \"You must do as you like.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly Isobel spoke out. \"This is your doing. If you had let me go, as\r\nI wanted to, this wouldn't have happened. You suspected it, and yet you\r\nkept me here. I begged you to let me go. You wouldn't. I tried to do the\r\nhonest thing--to end it all and go. You wouldn't let me--you know why.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wanted to go, Isobel?\" asked Vivien gently. \"And father wouldn't\r\nlet you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. If he likes to tell you the reason, he can. But I say this is his\r\ndoing--his! He's been waiting and watching for it. Well, he's got it\r\nnow, and he must deal with it.\"\r\n\r\nHer taunts broke down the last of Wellgood's self-control. \"Yes, I'll\r\ndeal with it!\" The lover forgot the father, the father forgot his\r\ndaughter. \"And I'll deal with him--the blackguard who's interfered\r\nbetween me and you!\"\r\n\r\nVivien turned her head towards her father with a quick motion. His eyes\r\nwere set on Isobel in a furious jealousy. Vivien gave a sharp indrawing\r\nof her breath. Now she understood.\r\n\r\n\"He shall pay for it!\" cried Wellgood, and made a dart towards Harry,\r\nraising the stick which he had in his hand.\r\n\r\nIn an instant Vivien was across his path, and caught his uplifted arm in\r\nboth of hers. \"Not that way, father!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go into the house, Vivien.\"\r\n\r\n\"For my sake, father!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go into the house, I say. Let me alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not till you promise me you won't do that.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked down into her pleading face. His own softened a little. \"Very\r\nwell, my girl, I promise you I won't do that.\"\r\n\r\nNeither Isobel nor Harry had moved; they made no sign now. Vivien slowly\r\nloosed her grasp of her father's arm and turned back towards the door.\r\nSuddenly Harry spoke in a hoarse whisper.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, Vivien, awfully sorry.\"\r\n\r\nThen she looked at him for a moment; a smile of sad wistfulness came on\r\nher lips.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm sure you're awfully sorry, Harry.\"\r\n\r\nShe passed into the house, leaving the door open behind her. Harry heard\r\nher slow steps crossing the hall.\r\n\r\n\"There's no more to be said to-night,\" said Isobel, and moved towards\r\nthe door. Wellgood was beforehand with her; he barred the way, standing\r\nin the entrance.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there's one more thing to be said.\" He was calmer now, but not a\r\nwhit less angry or less vicious. \"From to-night I've done with both of\r\nyou--I and my house. If you want her, take her. If you can get him, take\r\nhim--and keep him if you can. Let him remember what I've said. I keep my\r\nword. Let him remember! If he doesn't want this story told, let him make\r\nhimself scarce in Meriton. If he doesn't, as God's above us, he shall\r\nhear it wherever he goes. It shall never leave him while I live.\" He\r\nturned back to Isobel. \"And I've done with you--I and my house. Do what\r\nyou like, go where you like. You've set your foot for the last time\r\nwithin my threshold.\"\r\n\r\nHarry looked up with a quick jerk of his head. \"You don't mean\r\nto-night?\"\r\n\r\nA grim smile of triumph came on Wellgood's face. \"Ah, but I do mean\r\nto-night. You're in love with her--you can look after her. I'll leave\r\nyou the privilege of lodging her to-night. Rather late to get quarters\r\nfor a lady, but that's your lookout.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't do that, Mr. Wellgood?\" said Isobel, the first touch of\r\nentreaty in her voice.\r\n\r\nWith an oath he answered, \"I will, and this very minute.\"\r\n\r\nHe stood there, with his back to the door, a moment longer, his angry\r\neyes travelling from one to the other, showing his teeth in his vicious\r\nsmile. He had thought of a good revenge; humiliation, ignominy, ridicule\r\nshould be the portion of the woman who had cheated him and of the man\r\nwho took her from him. There was little thought of his daughter in his\r\nheart, or he might have shown mercy to this other girl.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you both a pleasant night,\" he said with a sneering laugh, then\r\nturned, went in, and banged the door behind him. They heard the bolt run\r\ninto its socket.\r\n\r\nIsobel came up to Harry. Stretching out her arms, she laid her hands on\r\nhis shoulders. Her composure, so long maintained, gave way at last. She\r\nbroke into hysterical sobbing as she stammered out, \"O Harry, my dear,\r\nmy dear, I'm so sorry! Do forgive!\"\r\n\r\nHarry Belfield took her face between his two hands and kissed it; but\r\nunder her embracing hands she felt his shoulders give a little shrug. It\r\nwas his old protest against those emotions. They had played him another\r\nscurvy trick!\r\n\r\nThe bolt was shot back again, the door opened. Fellowes, the butler,\r\nstood there. He held a hat and a long cloak in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Vivien told me to give you these, miss, and to say that she wasn't\r\nallowed to bring them herself, and that she has done her best.\"\r\n\r\nHarry took the things from him, handed the hat to Isobel, and wrapped\r\nher in the cloak.\r\n\r\nFellowes was an old family servant, who had known Harry from a boy.\r\n\r\n\"I dare do nothing, sir,\" he said, and went in, and shut the door again.\r\n\r\n\"It was good of Vivien,\" said Isobel, with a choking sob.\r\n\r\nHarry shrugged his shoulders again. \"Well, we must go--somewhere,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX.\r\n\r\nNO GOOD?\r\n\r\n\r\nAt supper the fun waxed fast and harmlessly furious. The party had\r\nreceived an unexpected accession in the person of Jack Rock. He had been\r\ncaught surveying the \"spread\" in company with Miss Dutton (she had\r\ndeclined the alarming hospitality of Halton), old Mr. Dove, and the\r\nBird--a trio who had been working for its perfection most of the day and\r\nall the evening. Having caught Jack, the Nun would by no means let him\r\ngo. She made him sit down by her in Harry's vacant place, declaring that\r\nroom could be found for Harry somewhere when he turned up, and in this\r\nhonourable position Jack was enjoying himself--honestly, simply, knowing\r\nthat they were \"up to their fun,\" neither spoilt nor embarrassed. Old\r\nMr. Dove, the Bird, and Miss Miles (when the bar closed she condescended\r\nto help at table, because she too had been in the profession) humoured\r\nthe joke, and served Jack with a slyly exaggerated deference. Billy Foot\r\nreferred to him as \"the eminent sportsman,\" and affected to believe that\r\nhe belonged to the Jockey Club. Gilly, who knew not Jack, perceiving the\r\nsportsman but missing the butcher, had a success the origin of which he\r\ndid not understand when he proceeded to explain to Jack what points were\r\nof really vital importance in a sweetbread.\r\n\r\n\"You gentlemen from London seem to study everything!\" exclaimed Jack\r\nadmiringly.\r\n\r\n\"This one does credit to the local butcher,\" said Gilly solemnly, and\r\nlooked round amazed when all glasses were lifted in honour of Jack Rock.\r\n\r\n\"Food is the only thing Gilly studies,\" remarked Miss Dutton. The supper\r\nproving satisfactory, she felt at liberty to indulge her one social gift\r\nof a sardonic humour.\r\n\r\n\"Quite right, Sally,\" Billy agreed. \"Food for his own body and for the\r\nminds of children. What he makes out of the latter he spends on the\r\nformer. That both are good you may see at a glance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I find myself with something like an appetite,\" Gilly announced.\r\n\r\n\"That's how I likes to see folks at the Lion,\" said old Mr. Dove, easily\r\ninterposing from behind his chair. \"A trifle more, sir?--Miss Miles,\r\nyour eye seems to have missed Mr. Gilbert Foot's glass.\"\r\n\r\n\"La, now, I was looking at Miss Flower's frock!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you helped to put it on me! You ought to know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It sets that sweet on you, Miss Flower.\"\r\n\r\nAll was merry and gay and easy--a pleasant ending to a pleasant holiday.\r\nThey all hoped to come back for the wedding, to run down for that\r\neventful day, but work claimed them on the morrow. London clamoured for\r\nthe Nun--new songs to be rehearsed now and sung in ten days. Billy Foot\r\nhad a heavy appeal at Quarter Sessions; Gilbert Foot and Co. demanded\r\nthe attention of its constituent members.\r\n\r\n\"Harry's a long time getting back,\" Andy remarked, looking at his watch.\r\n\r\n\"He's dallying,\" said Billy. \"I should dally myself if I had the\r\nchance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he found Wellgood back; I know he wanted to speak to\r\nhim--something about the settlements.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what might you be going to sing in London next, miss?\" asked Jack,\r\ngratefully accepting a tankard of beer which Mr. Dove, in silent\r\nunderstanding of his secret wishes, had placed beside him.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to be Joan of Arc,\" said the Nun. \"Know much about her, Mr.\r\nRock?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely, miss! Heard of her at school. The old gentleman used to talk\r\nabout her too, Andy. Burnt to death for a witch, poor girl, wasn't she?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems a most appropriate part for our hostess,\" remarked Billy Foot.\r\n\r\n\"Silly!\" Miss Dutton shot out contemptously.\r\n\r\n\"It's rather daring, but the Management put perfect reliance in my good\r\ntaste,\" the Nun pursued serenely. \"In the first song I'm just the\r\npeasant girl at--at--well, I forget the name of the village, somewhere\r\nin France--it'll be on the programme. In the second I'm in\r\narmour--silver armour--exhorting the King of France. They wanted me to\r\nbe on a horse, but I wouldn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"The horse might be heard neighing?\" Billy suggested. \"Off, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the horse would be where I was afraid of being,\" said the Nun, and\r\nsuddenly gurgled.\r\n\r\n\"Silver armour! My! Don't you want to take me up to see her?\" This came,\r\nin a perfectly audible aside, from Miss Miles to the Bird. Old Mr. Dove\r\ncoughed, yet benevolently.\r\n\r\n\"Much armour?\" asked Gilly, suddenly emerging from a deep attention to\r\nhis plate. His hopes obviously running towards what may be styled a\r\nclassical entertainment, the question was received with merriment.\r\n\r\n\"Completely encased, Gilly. I shall look like a lobster. Still, Mr. Rock\r\nwill come and see me, if the rest of you don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are possibilities about Joan of Arc,\" Gilly pursued. \"Not at all\r\nbad to lead off with Joan of Arc. Andy, you might make a note of Joan.\"\r\n\r\n\"If a frontispiece is of any use to you, Gilly--?\" the Nun suggested\r\npolitely.\r\n\r\n\"What can have become of Harry?\" Again it was Andy Hayes who asked.\r\n\r\nThe Nun turned to him and, under cover of Billy's imaginative\r\ndescription of the frontispiece, said softly, \"Can't you be happy unless\r\nyou know Harry Belfield's all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a very long time,\" said Andy. \"And they're early at Nutley, you\r\nknow. Perhaps he's decided to go straight home to bed.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him for a moment, but said nothing. The tide of merry\r\nempty talk--gone in the speaking, like the wine in the drinking, yet not\r\nless pleasant--flowed on; only now Miss Flower to some degree shared\r\nAndy's taciturnity. She was not apprehensive or gloomy; it seemed merely\r\nthat some sense of the real, the ordinary, course of life had come back\r\nto her; the hour of careless gaiety was no longer, like Joan of Arc,\r\n\"completely encased\" in silver armour.\r\n\r\nJack Rock turned to her, bashful, humble, yet sure of her kindness. \"I\r\nmust be goin', miss; I've to be up and about by seven. But--would you\r\nsing to us, miss, same as you did at that meetin'?\"\r\n\r\nIt was against etiquette to ask the Nun to sing on private occasions; if\r\nshe chose, she volunteered. But Jack was, naturally, innocent of the\r\netiquette.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I'll sing for you. Any favourite song, Jack?\"\r\n\r\n\"What pleases you'll please me, miss,\" said old Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I'll sing you an old Scotch one I happen to know.\"\r\n\r\nSilence obtained--from Billy Foot with some difficulty, since he had got\r\ninto an argument with Sally Dutton--the Nun began to sing:--\r\n\r\n  \"My Jeany and I have toiled\r\n    The livelong Summer's Day:\r\n  Till we were almost spoil'd\r\n    At making of the Hay.\r\n  Her Kerchy was of holland clear,\r\n    Tied to her bonny brow,\r\n  I whispered something in her ear;\r\n    But what is that to you?\"\r\n\r\nThe Bird, who had been dispatched to get Gilly Foot a whisky-and-soda,\r\ncame in, set it down, and moved towards Andy. \"Be still with you, Tom!\"\r\nsaid Jack Rock imperiously.\r\n\r\n  \"Her stockings were of Kersey green,\r\n    And tight as ony silk;\r\n  O, sic a leg was never seen!\r\n    Her skin was white as milk.\r\n  Her hair was black as ane could wish,\r\n    And sweet, sweet was her mou'!\r\n  Ah! Jeany daintily can kiss;\r\n    But what is that to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"She has a way of giving those two wretched last lines which is simply\r\nan outrage,\" Billy Foot complained to the now silent Sally Dutton.\r\n\r\nAgain the Bird tried to edge towards Andy. Jack Rock forbade.\r\n\r\n\"But I've a message,\" the Bird whispered protestingly.\r\n\r\n\"Damn your message! She's singin' to us!\"\r\n\r\n  \"The Rose and Lily baith combine\r\n    To make my Jeany fair;\r\n  There is no Benison like mine,\r\n    I have a'maist no care,\r\n  But when another swain, my fair,\r\n    Shall say 'You're fair to view,'\r\n  Let Jeany whisper in his ear,\r\n    'Pray, what is that to you?'\"\r\n\r\nThere was loud applause.\r\n\r\n\"I only sang it for Mr. Rock,\" said the Nun, relapsing into a demureness\r\nwhich had not consistently marked her rendering of the song.\r\n\r\nReleased from Jack's imprisoning eye, the Bird darted to Andy and\r\ndelivered his delayed message. \"Mr. Harry--Andy, if you'd step into the\r\nstreet, sir--Andy, I mean--(the Bird was confused as to social\r\ndistinctions)--he's waiting--and looking infernally put out!\"\r\n\r\n\"He wants me--outside? Why doesn't he come in? Well, I'll go.\" Andy rose\r\nto his feet.\r\n\r\n\"You've fired his imagination!\" remarked Gilly to the Nun. \"He goes to\r\nseek adventures. Yet your song was that of a moralist.\"\r\n\r\n\"A moralist somewhat too curious about a stocking,\" Billy opined.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, I never think anything of a girl who lets her stockings get\r\ninto wrinkles,\" the Nun observed, as she resumed her seat. \"Do you,\r\nJack?\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes had followed Andy as he went out. To tell the truth, they had\r\nchanced to fall on him once or twice as she sang her song. But Andy had\r\nlooked a little preoccupied; that fact had not made her sing worse--and\r\nat last Andy had gently drummed three fingers on the table.\r\n\r\n\"You've a wonderful way of puttin' it, miss,\" said old Jack Rock.\r\n\r\nShe laid her hand on his arm, saucily affectionate. \"Pray what is that\r\nto you?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'm off, miss. Thank you kindly. It's been an evenin' for me!\"\r\n\r\nShe let him go, with the kindest of farewells. A salvo of applause from\r\nthe company honoured his exit. She rested her chin in her hands, her\r\nelbows on the table. Jack Rock was to be heard saying his\r\ngood-nights--merry chaff with old Dove, with the Bird, with Miss Miles.\r\nWhy had Andy gone out--and Harry Belfield not come in?\r\n\r\nBilly Foot rose, moved round the table, and sat by her. \"Where did you\r\nfind it?\"\r\n\r\n\"In an old book a friend gave me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like it.\" Billy sounded quite convinced of the song's merit.\r\n\r\n\"It has got a little bit of--of the feeling, hasn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The feeling which I've always understood you never felt?\"\r\n\r\nShe was securely evasive. \"It's supposed to be a man who sings it,\r\nBilly.\"\r\n\r\n\"That accounts for the foolishness of the sentiments?\"\r\n\r\n\"Makes them sound familiar, anyhow,\" said the Nun, preferring experience\r\nto theory.\r\n\r\nAndy came in. He went quickly to the Nun and bent down over her chair.\r\n\r\n\"Harry's outside--with Miss Vintry. He wants to know if he may bring her\r\nin,\" he said, speaking very low.\r\n\r\nSurprise got the better of the Nun's discretion. Her voice was audible\r\nto them all, as she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Miss Vintry with him! At this time of night!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think perhaps--as we've finished supper--we'd better break up,\" said\r\nAndy, apologetically addressing the company.\r\n\r\n\"Why? Has anything happened?\" asked Billy Foot.\r\n\r\n\"I think so.\" He bent down to the Nun again. \"Miss Vintry has got to\r\nsleep here to-night.\" His voice was low, but they were all very still,\r\nand the voice carried.\r\n\r\n\"There's no room for her--with Gilly here as well as us,\" the Nun\r\nprotested rather fretfully.\r\n\r\n\"You must make room somehow,\" he returned firmly. \"I'm going to bring\r\nthem in now.\" He looked significantly at Billy Foot. \"We're rather a\r\nlarge party.\"\r\n\r\nBilly turned to his brother. \"I'm off home. Will you stroll with me as\r\nfar as Halton?\"\r\n\r\nGilly nodded in a bewildered fashion--he was not up in Meriton\r\naffairs--and slowly rose.\r\n\r\n\"And when I come back I'll go straight to bed,\" he said, looking at Andy\r\nto see whether what he suggested met with acceptance.\r\n\r\nAndy nodded approval; Gilly would be best in bed.\r\n\r\nWith the briefest farewell the brothers passed out. As they went, they\r\nsaw Harry Belfield, with a woman on his arm, walking slowly up and down\r\non the other side of the street.\r\n\r\nSally Dutton rose. \"I'll go to bed too.\" As she reached the door she\r\nturned round and said, \"At least I'll wait in my room. She--she can come\r\nin with me, if she likes, Andy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Andy gravely.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Andy?\" the Nun asked.\r\n\r\n\"A general break-up,\" he answered briefly, as he followed Sally Dutton\r\nout of the room.\r\n\r\nThe Nun sat on amidst the relics of her feast--the fruit, the flowers,\r\nthe empty bottles. Somehow they all looked rather ghastly. She gave a\r\nlittle shiver of disgust.\r\n\r\nAndy came in with Isobel Vintry clinging to his arm, Harry following and\r\ncarefully closing the door.\r\n\r\nAndy made Isobel sit down at the table and offered her some wine from a\r\nhalf-emptied bottle. She refused with a gesture and laid her head\r\nbetween her hands on the table. Harry threw his hat on a chair and stood\r\nhelplessly in the middle of the room. The Nun sat in a hostile silence.\r\n\r\n\"She'd better go straight to bed,\" said Andy.\r\n\r\n\"She can have my room. I'll go in with Sally.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her. \"She'd better have somebody with her, I think. Will\r\nyou call Sally?\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun obeyed, and Sally came. As she passed Harry, she smiled in her\r\nqueer derisive fashion, but her voice was kind as she took hold of\r\nIsobel's arm and raised her, saying, \"Come, you're upset to-night. It\r\nwon't look half so bad in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nHarry met Isobel and clasped her hands. Then she and Sally Dutton went\r\nout together.\r\n\r\nHarry sat down heavily in a chair by the table and poured out a glass of\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n\"Do you two men want to be alone together?\" the Nun asked.\r\n\r\nHarry shook his head. \"I'm just off home.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all arranged,\" said Andy. \"Harry goes to London by the early train\r\nto-morrow. I shall get her things from Nutley directly after breakfast\r\nand bring them here. You and Sally will look after her till twelve\r\no'clock. Then I'll take her to the station. Harry will meet her at the\r\nother end, and--well, they've made their plans.\"\r\n\r\nHarry lit a cigarette and smoked it very quickly, between gulps of wine.\r\nAndy had begun to smoke too. His air was calm, though grave; he seemed\r\nto have taken charge of the whole affair.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to marry her?\" the Nun suddenly inquired, with her usual\r\ndirectness.\r\n\r\n\"You might have gathered that much from what Andy said,\" Harry grumbled\r\nin an injured tone.\r\n\r\n\"Does Vivien know yet?\"\r\n\r\nHe dropped his cigarette-end into his emptied glass.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he answered, frowning. \"For God's sake, don't put me through a\r\ncatechism, Doris!\" He rose from his chair, looking round for his hat.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I walk back with you?\" Andy asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, thanks. I'd rather be alone.\" His tone was still very injured, as\r\nthough the two were in league with one another, and with all the world,\r\nto persecute him. He came up to the Nun. \"I shan't see you again for a\r\nbit, I expect. Good-bye, Doris.\" He held out his hand to her. The Nun\r\ninterlaced her hands on the table in front of her.\r\n\r\n\"I won't!\" she said. \"I won't shake hands with you to-night, Harry\r\nBelfield. You've broken the heart of the sweetest girl I ever met.\r\nYou've brought shame and misery on her--you who aren't fit to black her\r\nshoes! You've brought shame on your people. I suppose you've pretty well\r\ndone for yourself in Meriton. And all for what? Because you must\r\nphilander, must have your conquests, must always be proving to yourself\r\nthat nobody can resist you!\"\r\n\r\nHarry looked morosely resentful at the indictment. \"Oh, you can't\r\nunderstand. Nobody can understand who--who isn't made that way. You talk\r\nas if I'd meant to do it!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I'd rather you had meant to do it. That'd be rather less\r\ncontemptible, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gently, gently, Doris!\" Andy interposed.\r\n\r\nShe turned on him. \"Oh yes, it's always 'Gently, gently!' with Harry\r\nBelfield. He's to be indulged, and excused, and forgiven, and all the\r\nrest of it. Let him hear the truth for once, Andy. Even if it doesn't do\r\nhim any good to hear it, it does me good to say it--lots of good!\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better go, Harry. You won't find her good company to-night. I'll\r\nbe at the station to see you off to-morrow--before I see about the\r\nthings at Nutley.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going; and I'm much obliged to Doris for her abuse. She's always\r\nbeen the same about me--sneering and snarling!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've never made a fool of myself about you. That's what you can't\r\nforgive, Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, my dear fellow, go,\" said Andy. \"What's the use of this?\"\r\n\r\nHarry moved off towards the door. As he went out, he said over his\r\nshoulder, \"At any rate you can't say I'm not doing the square thing\r\nnow!\"\r\n\r\nThey heard the \"Boots\" open the door of the inn for him; a moment later\r\nhis step passed the window. Andy came and sat down by the Nun; she\r\ncaught his big hand in hers.\r\n\r\n\"I'm trying hard not to cry. I don't want to break my record. How did it\r\nall happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wellgood came back before they expected him. Harry met her--by chance,\r\nhe says--after he'd left Vivien, and he was carried away, he says.\r\nSomehow or other--I don't quite understand how--Vivien came on the scene\r\nagain. Then Wellgood was on to them, and had the whole thing out, before\r\nhis daughter. It seems that he's in love with Miss Vintry himself--so I\r\nunderstood Harry. That, of course, didn't make him any kinder.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's cruel, cruel, cruel!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but do you remember a talk we had about it once?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. You thought this--this sort of thing would really be the best.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking of Miss Wellgood. Of course, for poor Harry--Wellgood's\r\na dangerous enemy!\" He paused a moment. \"And the thing's so bad. He\r\nwasn't square with either of them, and they're both in love with him, I\r\nsuppose!\"\r\n\r\n\"This woman here in love with him? Really? Not only for the match?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry for her then. She'd much better not be! Oh, I daresay he'll\r\nmarry her. How much will that mean with Harry Belfield?\"\r\n\r\nFeeling in less danger of breaking her record, she loosed her hold of\r\nAndy's hand. He rose.\r\n\r\n\"I must be off. I've a lot to do to-morrow. Gilly'll have to look after\r\nthe office. I've got to see Mr. Belfield among other things; and Harry\r\nwants me to see Vivien Wellgood--and, well, try to say something for\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just like him! He breaks the pitcher and leaves you to sweep up the\r\npieces!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he can't see her himself, can he?\"\r\n\r\n\"He'd make love to her again if he did. You may be sure of that!\"\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and Sally Dutton came in in her dressing-gown, with her\r\npretty hair all about her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"She's asleep--sound asleep. So I--may I stay a few minutes with you,\r\nDoris? I--I've got the blues awfully badly.\" She came to the Nun and\r\nknelt down beside her. Suddenly she broke into a torrent of sobs. Andy\r\nheard her say through them, \"Oh, it reminds me--!\"\r\n\r\nDoris looked at him and nodded. \"I shall see you soon in London, Andy?\"\r\n\r\nHe pressed her hand and left the two girls together.\r\n\r\nGilly Foot was smoking a reflective pipe outside the door; he had\r\npossessed himself of the key and sent the sleepy \"Boots\" to bed. Andy\r\nobtained leave of absence for the morrow.\r\n\r\n\"Rather a disturbed evening, eh, Andy?\" said Gilly, smoking\r\nthoughtfully. \"Lucky it didn't happen till we'd done supper! Fact is one\r\ndoesn't like to say it of an old friend--but Harry Belfield's no good.\"\r\n\r\nAndy had a whimsical idea that at such a sentiment the stones of Meriton\r\nHigh Street would cry out. The pet and the pride of the town, the man of\r\nall accomplishments, the man who was to have that wonderful career--here\r\nhe was being cavalierly and curtly dismissed as \"no good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, we must give him another chance,\" Andy urged.\r\n\r\nGilly knocked out his pipe with an air of decision.\r\n\r\n\"Rotten--rotten at the core, old boy, that's it,\" he said, as with a nod\r\nof good-night he entered the precincts of the Lion.\r\n\r\nAndy Hayes was sore to the heart. He had thought that a catastrophe such\r\nas this, a \"row,\" would be the best thing--the best for Vivien Wellgood.\r\nHe was even surer of it now--even now, when to think of the pain she\r\nsuffered sent a pang through his heart. But what a light that increased\r\ncertainty of his threw on Harry Belfield! And, as he said to himself,\r\ntrudging home from the Lion, Harry had always been a part of his\r\nlife--in early days a very big part--and one of the most cherished.\r\nHarry's hand had been the source whence benefits flowed; Harry's example\r\nhad been an inspiration. Whatever Harry had done now, or might do in the\r\nfuture--that future now suddenly become so much less assured, so much\r\nharder to foresee--the great debt remained. Andy did not grudge\r\n\"sweeping up the pieces.\" Alas, that he could not mend the broken\r\npitcher! Sore as his heart was for the blow that had fallen on\r\nVivien--on her so frail that the lightest touch of adversity seemed\r\ncruel--yet his sorest pain was that the blow came from Harry Belfield's\r\nhand. That filled him with a shame almost personal. He had so identified\r\nhimself with his friend and hero, he had so shared in and profited by\r\nthe good in him--his kindness, his generosity, his championship--that he\r\ncould not rid himself of a feeling of sharing also in the evil. In the\r\nsullying of Harry's honour he saw his own stained--even as by Harry's\r\nhigh achievements he would have felt his own friendship glorified.\r\n\r\n\"Without Harry I should never have been where or what I am.\" That was\r\nthe thought in his mind, and it was a sure verity. Harry had opened the\r\ndoors, he had walked through. Whatever Harry had done or would do with\r\nhis own life, he had done much for his friend's, and done it gaily and\r\ngladly. Doris Flower might chide and despair; Gilly Foot's contemptuous\r\nverdict might dismiss Harry to his fate. That could not be Andy's mood\r\nnor Andy's attitude. Gratitude forbade despair; it must be his part\r\nstill to work, to aid, to shelter; always, above all, to forgive, and to\r\ntry--at least to try--to comprehend.\r\n\r\nLove or friendship can set no higher or harder task than in demanding\r\nthe comprehension of a temperament utterly diverse, alien, and\r\nincompatible. That was the task Andy's heart laid on his brain. \"You\r\nmust not give up,\" was its command. Others might take their pleasure in\r\nHarry's gifts, might enjoy his brilliance, or reap benefit from his\r\nready kindness--and then, when trouble came, pass by on the other side.\r\nThere was every excuse for them; in the common traffic of life no more\r\nis asked or expected; men, even brilliant men, must behave themselves at\r\ntheir peril. Andy did not stand so. It was his to try to assess Harry's\r\nweakness, and to see if anywhere there could be found a remedy, a\r\nbuttress for the weak wall in that charming edifice. Such a pity if it\r\nfell down, with all its beauties, just because of that one weak wall!\r\nBut, alas, poor Andy was ill-fitted for this exacting task of love's. He\r\nmight tell himself where his duty lay; he might argue that he could and\r\ndid understand how a man might have a weak spot, and yet be a good\r\nman--one capable of useful and high things. But his instinct, the native\r\ncolour of his mind, was all against these arguments. The shame that such\r\na man should do such things was stronger. The weak spot seemed to spread\r\nin ever-widening circles; the evil seemed more and more to invade and\r\ninfect the system; the weak wall doomed the whole edifice. Reason,\r\nargue, and pray for his friend as he might, in his inmost mind a voice\r\ndeclared that this day had witnessed the beginning of the end of the\r\nHarry Belfield whom he had loved.\r\n\r\n\"Harry Belfield's no good!\" \"How are the mighty fallen and the weapons\r\nof war perished!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE EMPTY PLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelfield rubbed his hands against one another with a rueful smile. \"Yes,\r\nyes, he's a hard fellow. He's hard on us; hard in taking a course that\r\nmakes scandal inevitable. Meriton High Street will be breast-high in\r\ngossip about the midnight expulsion in a few hours. And hard in this--I\r\nsuppose I'm not entitled to call it persecution--this punishment with\r\nwhich he threatens Harry. Still, if a man had treated my daughter in\r\nthat way, and that daughter Vivien--\" He spread out his hands, and\r\nadded, \"But then he's always been as hard as nails to the poor girl\r\nherself. You think there's that other motive? If you're right there, I\r\nput my foot in it once.\" He was thinking of certain hints he had given\r\nWellgood at dinner one evening.\r\n\r\n\"There's no doubt about it, I think, sir, but it doesn't help us much.\r\nIt may show that Wellgood's motives aren't purely paternal, but it\r\ndoesn't make matters better for Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's terribly awkward--with us at one end of the town and Nutley at the\r\nother. Most things blow over, but\"--he screwed up his face\r\nwryly--\"meeting's awkward! And there's the politics! Wellgood's chairman\r\nof his Association. Oh, Harry, Harry, you have made a mess of it! I\r\nthink I'll go and talk it over with Meriton--make a clean breast of it\r\nand see what he says. He might be able to keep Wellgood quiet. You don't\r\nlook as if you thought there was much chance of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know whether Harry would come back and face it, even if\r\nWellgood were managed. A tough morsel for his pride to swallow! And if\r\nhe did, could he bring her--at all events so long as Miss Wellgood's at\r\nNutley? Yet if they marry--and I suppose they will--\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we may take it that he'll marry her. The boy's ungoverned and\r\nuntrustworthy, but he's not shabby, Andy.\" A note of pleading for his\r\nson crept into his voice.\r\n\r\n\"It's the right thing for him to do, but it'll make it still more\r\ndifficult to go on as if nothing had happened. However I hope you will\r\nsee Lord Meriton and get his opinion.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like you to talk to Wellgood and find out what his terms\r\nreally are. I can't ask favours of him, but I want to know exactly where\r\nwe stand. And Vivien--no, I must write to her myself, poor dear girl.\r\nNot a pleasant letter to write.\" He paused a moment and asked, with an\r\nair of being rather ashamed of the question, \"Is the sinner himself very\r\ndesperate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Last night he was, I think; at any rate terribly angry with himself,\r\nand--I'm afraid I must add--with his bad luck. When I saw him off this\r\nmorning he was in one of his defiant moods, saying he could get on\r\nwithout Meriton's approval, and wishing the whole place at the devil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, that's Harry! Because he's made a fool--and worse--of\r\nhimself, you and I and Meriton are to go to the devil! Well, I suppose\r\nit's not peculiar to poor Harry. And you saw him off? I can't thank you\r\nfor all your kindness, Andy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, if a man can feel that way, I'd almost rather have done the\r\nthing myself! I've got to ask her to see me on his behalf.\"\r\n\r\nBelfield shook his head. \"Not much to be said there. And I've got to\r\ntell my wife. Not much there either.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid Mrs. Belfield will be terribly distressed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes; but mothers wear special spectacles, you know. She'll think\r\nit very deplorable, but it's quite likely that she'll find out it's\r\nsomebody else's fault. Wellgood's, probably, because she never much\r\nliked him. If it helps her, let her think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was partly his fault. Why didn't he own up about Miss Vintry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much excuse, even if you'd been the trespasser. With Harry engaged\r\nto Vivien, no excuse at all. How could it be in any legitimate way\r\nHarry's business what Wellgood wanted of Isobel Vintry? Still it may be\r\nthat the argument'll be good enough for his mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, I'll see Wellgood to-day, and let you know the result. And\r\nMiss Wellgood too, if she'll see me. I positively must go to London\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes. You go back to work, Andy. You've your own life. And that\r\npretty girl, Miss Flower--does she go back too?\"\r\n\r\n\"She goes this afternoon. And Billy Foot with them, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, so he does. I forgot. Give her my love. I'd come and give her a\r\nnosegay at the station, only I don't feel like facing people to-day.\" He\r\nsighed wearily. \"A man's pride is easily hit through his children. And I\r\nsuppose we've cracked Harry up to the skies! Nemesis, Andy, Nemesis!\r\nThere, good-bye. You're a thorough good fellow.\"\r\n\r\nBilly Foot waylaid Andy as he left Halton. Billy's view of the matter\r\nwas not ideal or exalted, but it went to a practical point.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever know such a fool?\" cried Billy. \"What does he want to do\r\nit down here for? He's got all London to play the fool in, if he must\r\nplay the fool! Nobody knows there, or if they do they don't care. Or if\r\nA cares B doesn't, and B's just as amusing to dine with--probably more\r\nso. But in this little hen-roost of a place! All the fowls'll cackle,\r\nand all to the same tune. I'll lay you six to four he's dished himself\r\nfor good in Meriton. Where are you off to?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got to see Miss Vintry off, then I'm going to Nutley. By-the-bye,\r\nhow did you hear about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't hard to guess, last night, was it? However, to inform my mind\r\nbetter, Andy, I took occasion to call at the Lion. I didn't see Miss\r\nVintry, but I did see Miss Flower. Also I saw old Dove, and young Dove,\r\nand Miss Miles, all with faces as long as your arm--and enjoying\r\nthemselves immensely! You can no more keep it dark in a place like this\r\nthan you can hide the parish church under your pocket-handkerchief.\r\nThey'll all know there was a row at Nutley; they'll all know Miss Vintry\r\nwas turned out and slept at the Lion; they'll all know that Harry and\r\nshe have gone to London, and, of course, they'll know the engagement's\r\nbroken. They're not clever, I admit--I've made speeches to them--but I\r\nsuppose they're not born idiots! They must have a rudimentary inductive\r\nfaculty.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth of these words was clearly shown to Andy's mind when he called\r\nat the Lion to pick up Isobel. She was alone in the Nun's sitting-room;\r\nthe two girls had already said good-bye to her and gone out for a last\r\nwalk in Meriton. When she came into the hall to meet him she was\r\nconfronted by a phalanx of hostile eyes--Miss Miles', old Dove's, the\r\nBird's, two chambermaids', the very \"Boots\" who had officiated at the\r\ndoor on the previous night. Nobody spoke to her. Her luggage, sent down\r\nfrom Nutley in answer to Andy's messenger, was already on the cab. Andy\r\nwas left himself to open the door. Nobody even wanted a tip from her.\r\nCould unpopularity go further or take any form more glaring?\r\n\r\nBefore the hostile eyes (she included Andy's among them) Isobel was\r\nherself again--calm, haughty, unabashed, her feelings under full\r\ncontrol. There were no signs of the tempest she had passed through; she\r\nwas again the Miss Vintry who had given lessons in courage and the other\r\nmanly virtues. Andy was unfeignedly glad that this was her condition;\r\nhis practical equipment included small aptitude for dealing with\r\nhysterics.\r\n\r\nFor the better part of the way to the station she said nothing. At last\r\nshe looked across at Andy, who sat opposite to her, and remarked, \"Well,\r\nMr. Hayes, you saw the beginning; now you see the end.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since it has happened, I can only hope the end will be happy--for you\r\nand for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm getting what I wanted. If you want a thing and get it, you can\r\nhardly complain, whatever happens.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds very reasonable, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"The best thing to hope about reason is to hope you won't need it? Yes!\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed that the news had not yet spread so far afield as to reach the\r\nstation. The old stationmaster was friendly and loquacious.\r\n\r\n\"Quite a break-up of you all to-day, sir,\" he said. \"Mr. 'Arry gone by\r\nthe first train, the stout gentleman by the next, now Miss Vintry, and a\r\ncarriage engaged for Miss Flower's party and Mr. Foot this afternoon! A\r\nreal break-up, I call it!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's about what it comes to, Mr. Parsons,\" said Andy, as he handed\r\nIsobel into the train.\r\n\r\n\"Well, 'olidays must 'ave an end. A pleasant journey and a safe return,\r\nmiss.\"\r\n\r\nIsobel smiled at Andy. \"You'd stop at the first part of the wish, Mr.\r\nHayes?\"\r\n\r\nAndy put out his hand to her. With the slightest air of surprise she\r\ntook it. \"We must make the best of it. Do what you can for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do all he'll let me.\" Her eyes met his; she smiled. \"I know all\r\nthat as well as you do. Surely I, if anybody, ought to know it?\" It\r\nseemed to Andy as if that were what her eyes and her smile said. \"I want\r\nyou to deliver one message for me,\" she went on. \"Don't be alarmed, I'm\r\nnot daring to send a message to anybody who belongs to Meriton. But when\r\nyou next see Miss Dutton, will you tell her I shan't forget her\r\nkindness? I've already thanked Miss Flower for the use of her\r\nsitting-room. Ah, we're moving! Good-bye!\"\r\n\r\nShe was smiling as she went. Andy was smiling too; the degree of her\r\ngratitude to Sally Dutton and to the Nun respectively had been admirably\r\ndefined.\r\n\r\nThe fire of Wellgood's wrath was still smouldering hotly, ready to break\r\nout at any moment if the slightest breath of passion fanned it. He\r\nreceived Andy civilly enough, but at the first hint that he came in some\r\nsort as an ambassador from Harry's father, his back stiffened.  His\r\nposition was perfectly clear, and seemed unalterable. So far as it lay\r\nin his power he would banish Harry Belfield from Meriton and put an end\r\nto any career he might have there.  He repeated to Andy more calmly, but\r\nnot less forcibly, what he had shouted in his fury the evening before.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I want it kept as quiet as possible; but I don't want it kept\r\nquiet at the cost of that fellow's going unpunished--getting off\r\nscot-free! We've nothing to be ashamed of.  Publicity won't hurt us,\r\nlittle as we may like it. But it'll hurt him, and he shall have it in\r\nfull measure--straight in the face. Is it a possible state of things\r\nthat he should be here, living in the place, taking part in our public\r\naffairs, being our Member, while my daughter is at Nutley?  I say no,\r\nand I think Belfield--his father, I mean--ought to be able to see it for\r\nhimself.  What then?  Are we to be driven out of our home?\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be absurd, of course,\" Andy had to admit.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me the only alternative.\" He rose from his chair, and\r\nwalked up and down like an angry tiger. He faced round on Andy. \"For a\r\nbeginning, the first step he takes in regard to the seat, I shall resign\r\nfrom the committee of the Association, and state my reasons for my\r\naction in plain language--and I think you know I can speak plainly. I\r\nshall do the same about any other public work which involves meeting\r\nhim.  I shall do the same about the hunt, the same about everything. And\r\nI'll ask my friends--I'll ask decent people--to choose between Harry\r\nBelfield and me. To please my daughter, I didn't break his head, as I\r\nshould have liked to, but, by heaven, I'll spoil his game in Meriton!\r\nI'm afraid that's the only message I can give you to take to Halton.\"\r\n\r\n\"In fact you'll do your best to get him boycotted?\" Andy liked\r\ncompendious statements.\r\n\r\n\"That's exactly what I mean to do, Hayes.  A man going to be married to\r\nmy daughter in a fortnight--parted from her the moment before on the\r\nfooting of her lover--found making violent love to another inmate of my\r\nhouse, her companion, almost within my very house itself--sounds well,\r\ndoesn't it?  Calculated to recommend him to his friends, and to the\r\nconstituency?\"\r\n\r\nAndy tried a last shot. \"Is this action of yours really best for Miss\r\nWellgood, or what she would wish?\"\r\n\r\nWellgood flushed in anger, conscious of his secret motives, by no means\r\nsure that he was not suspected of them. \"I judge for my daughter. And\r\nit's not what she may wish, but what is proper in regard to her that I\r\nconsider.  On the other hand, if he lets Meriton alone, he may do what\r\nhe likes. That's not my affair. I'm not going to hunt him over the whole\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's something,\" said Andy with a patient smile. \"I'll\r\ncommunicate your terms to Mr. Belfield.\" He paused, glancing doubtfully\r\nat his most unconciliatory companion. \"Do you think it would be painful\r\nto Miss Wellgood to see me?\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped suddenly in his prowling up and down the room. \"That's funny!\r\nShe was just saying she would like to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad to hear that. I want to be quite frank. Harry has asked me to\r\nexpress to her his bitter regret.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more than that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more, on my honour.\"\r\n\r\n\"She wants to say something to you.\" He frowned in hesitation. \"If I\r\nthought there was the smallest chance of her being induced to enter into\r\ndirect communication with him, I'd say no at once. But there's no chance\r\nof that. And she wants to see you. Yes, you can see her, if you like.\r\nShe's in the garden, by the lake, I think. She's taken this well, Hayes;\r\nshe's showing a thousand times more pluck than I ever thought she had.\"\r\nHis voice grew gentle. \"Poor little girl! Yes, go! She wants to see\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nAndy had taken nothing by his first mission; he felt quite hopelessly\r\nunfit for his second. To offer the apologies of a faithless swain was no\r\nmore in his line than to be a faithless swain himself; the fleeting\r\nrelics of Harry's authority had imposed a last uncongenial task. Perhaps\r\nhis very mum-chanceness was his saving. Glib protestations would have\r\nsmacked too strongly of the principal to commend the agent. Vivien heard\r\nhis stammering words in silence, seeming wrapped in an aloofness that\r\nshe took for her sole remaining protection. She bowed her head gravely\r\nat the \"bitter regret,\" at the \"unguarded moment,\" at the \"fatal\r\nirresolution\"--Andy's memory held fast to the phrases, but refused to\r\nweld them into one of Harry's shapely periods. On \"fatal irresolution\"\r\nhe came to a full stop. He dared not look at her--it would seem an\r\nintrusion, a brutality; he stared steadily over the lake.\r\n\r\n\"I knew he had moods like that,\" she said after a long silence. \"I never\r\nrealized what they could do to a man. I daresay it would be hard for me\r\nto realize. I'm glad he wanted to--to say a word of regret. There's one\r\nthing I should like you to tell him; that's why I wanted to see you.\"\r\n\r\nNow Andy turned to her, for her voice commanded his attention.\r\n\r\n\"How fagged-out you look, Miss Wellgood!\" he exclaimed impulsively.\r\n\r\n\"Things aren't easy,\" she said in a low steady voice. \"If I could have\r\nsilence! But I have to listen to denunciation. You'll understand. Did he\r\ntell you what--what passed?\"\r\n\r\n\"The gist of it, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you'll understand that I mayn't have the power to stop the\r\ndenunciations, or--or the other steps that may be threatened or taken. I\r\nshould like him to know that they're not my doing. And I should like him\r\nto know too that I would a thousand times sooner this had happened than\r\nthat other thing which I believe he meant to happen--honestly meant to\r\nhappen--but for--this accident.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm with you in that, Miss Wellgood. It's far better.\"\r\n\r\n\"I accept what he says--an unguarded moment. But I--I thought he had a\r\nguard.\" She sat silent again for a minute. \"There's one other thing I\r\nshould like to say to him, through you. But you'll know best whether to\r\nsay it or not, I think. I should like to tell him that he can't make me\r\nforget--almost that he can't make me ungrateful. He gave me, in our\r\nearly days together, the first real joy I'd ever had--I expect the only\r\nperfect joy I ever shall have. What he gave then, he can't wholly take\r\naway.\" She looked at Andy with a faint melancholy smile. \"Shall you tell\r\nhim that?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you leave it to me, I shan't tell him that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"You want it all over, don't you?\" he asked bluntly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then don't tell Harry Belfield that. Think it, if you like. Don't tell\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nA look of sheer wonder came into her eyes. \"He's like that?\" she\r\nmurmured.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, like that. That's the trouble. He'd better think\r\nyou're--hopelessly disgusted.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm hopelessly at sea, anyhow,\" she said, turning her eyes to the lake\r\nagain. But she turned back to him quickly, still with her faint smile.\r\n\"Disgusted? Oh, you're thinking of the fastidiousness? Ah, that seems a\r\nlong time ago! You were very kind then; you're very kind now.\" She laid\r\nher hand lightly on his arm; for the first time her voice shook. \"You\r\nand I can sometimes talk about him as he used to be--just we two\r\ntogether!\"\r\n\r\n\"Or as we thought he was?\" Andy's tones were blunt still, and now rather\r\nbitter.\r\n\r\n\"Or as we thought he was--and, by thinking it, were so happy! Yes, we'd\r\nbetter not talk about him at all. I don't think I really could. You'll\r\nbe seeing Mr. Belfield soon? Give him my dear love, and say I'll come\r\nand see him and Mrs. Belfield as soon as they want me. He sent me a note\r\nthis morning. I can't answer it just yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell him.\" Andy rose to go.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but must you go just yet? I don't want you to.\" She glanced up at\r\nhim, with a sad humour. \"Curly's out, you know, and terribly big and\r\nrampageous!\"\r\n\r\n\"But you're not running away now, any more than you did then.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm trying to stand still, and--and look at it--at what it means about\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't think all life's like that--or all men either.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the temptation--to think that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Men are tempted to think it about women too, sometimes.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. \"Yes, of course, that's true. I'm glad you said that. You\r\nare good against Curly!\"\r\n\r\nThey had Wellgood in their minds. It was grievance against grievance at\r\nNutley; the charge of inconstancy is eternally bandied to and fro\r\nbetween the sexes--_Varium et mutabile semper Femina_ against \"Men were\r\ndeceivers ever\"--_Souvent femme varie_ against the sorrowfully\r\nridiculous chronicles of breach of promise of marriage cases. Plenty of\r\nmatter for both sides! Probably both sides would be wise to say as\r\nlittle as possible about it. If misogyny is bad, is misandry any better?\r\nAt all events the knowledge of Wellgood's grievance might help to\r\nprevent Vivien's from warping her mind. Hers was the greater, but his\r\nwas of the same order.\r\n\r\nThe world incarnated itself to her in the image of the big retriever\r\ndog, being so alarming, meaning no harm consciously, meaning indeed\r\naffection--with its likelihood of paws soiling white raiment. Andy again\r\nstood dressed as the guardian, the policeman. He was to be \"good against\r\nCurly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Isobel?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I saw her off all right by the twelve-fifteen, Miss Wellgood--to\r\nLondon, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, to London.\" To both of them London might have been spelt \"Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was never really unkind to me,\" said Vivien thoughtfully. \"I expect\r\nit did me good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never a favourite of mine--even before this,\" Andy pronounced, rather\r\nponderously.\r\n\r\nShe shot a side glance at him. \"I believe you thought she beat me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I thought that sometimes you'd sooner she had done that than\r\nstand there smiling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you're prejudiced! She wasn't unkind; and in this thing, you see, I\r\nknow her temptation. Surely that ought to bring sympathy? Tell me--you\r\nsaw her off--well--how?\" She spoke in jerks, now seeming agitated.\r\n\r\n\"Very calm--quite her own mistress--seeming to know what her job was.\r\nConfound it, Miss Wellgood, I'd sooner not talk about her any more!\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall you see Harry?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to till--till things have settled down a bit. I shall\r\nwrite about what you've said.\"\r\n\r\n\"About part of what I've said,\" she reminded him. \"You've convinced me\r\nabout that.\"\r\n\r\nAndy rose again, and this time she did not seek to hinder him.\r\n\r\n\"I'm off to town to-morrow; back to work.\" He paused a moment, then\r\nadded, \"If I get down for a week-end, may I come and see you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do--always, if you can. And remember me to Miss Flower and to Billy\r\nFoot; and tell them that I am\"--she seemed to seek a word, but ended\r\nlamely--\"very well, please.\"\r\n\r\nAndy nodded. She wanted them to know that her courage was not broken.\r\n\r\nOn his way out he met Wellgood again, moodily sauntering in the drive by\r\nthe lake.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you think of her?\" Wellgood asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"She's feels it terribly, but she's taking it splendidly.\"\r\n\r\nWellgood nodded emphatically, saying again, \"I never thought she had\r\nsuch pluck.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think, you know,\" said Andy, in his candid way, \"that you\r\ncould help her a bit, Mr. Wellgood. It does her no good to be taken over\r\nit again and again. Least said, soonest mended.\"\r\n\r\nWellgood looked at him suspiciously. \"I'm not going back on my terms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait and see if they are accepted. Let him alone till then. She'd thank\r\nyou for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to help her,\" said Wellgood. His tone was rather surly, rather\r\nashamed, but it seemed to carry a confession that he had not helped his\r\ndaughter much in the past. \"You're right, Hayes. Let's be done with the\r\nfellow for good, if we can!\"\r\n\r\nFrom all sides came the same sentiment: from Wellgood as a hope, from\r\nVivien as a sorrowful but steadfast resolution, from Billy Foot as a\r\nconsidered verdict on the facts of the case. Andy's own reflections had\r\neven anticipated these other voices. An end of Harry Belfield, so far as\r\nregarded the circle of which he had been the centre and the ornament!\r\nWould Harry accept the conclusion? He might tell Meriton to \"go to the\r\ndevil\" in a moment of irritated defiance; but to abandon Meriton would\r\nbe a great rooting-up, a sore break with all his life past, and with his\r\nlife in the future as he had planned it and his friends had pictured it\r\nfor him. Must he accept it whether he would or not? Wellgood's pistol\r\nwas at his head. Would he brave the shot, or what hand would turn away\r\nthe threatening barrel?\r\n\r\nNot Lord Meriton's. When Belfield, possessed of Wellgood's terms, laid\r\nthem before him, together with an adequate statement of the facts, the\r\ngreat man disclaimed the power. Though he softened his opinion for\r\nHarry's father, it was very doubtful if he had the wish.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, Belfield, uncommon sorry--well, you know that--both for you\r\nand for Mrs. Belfield. I hope she's not too much cut up?\"\r\n\r\n\"She's distressed; but she blames Wellgood and the other woman most. I'm\r\nglad she does.\"\r\n\r\nMeriton nodded. \"But it's most infernally awkward; there's no disguising\r\nit. You may say that any man--at any rate, many a man--is liable to come\r\na mucker like this. But happening just now--and with Wellgood's\r\ndaughter! Wellgood's our right hand man, in this part of the Division at\r\nall events. And he's as stubborn a dog as lives! Said he'd resign from\r\nthe hunt if your boy showed up, did he? By Jove, he'd do it, you know!\r\nThat's the deuce of it! I suppose the question is how much opinion he'd\r\ncarry with him. He's not popular--that's something; but a father\r\nfighting in his daughter's cause! They won't know the other side of it\r\nyou've told me about; and if Harry marries the woman, he can't very well\r\ntell them. Then is she to come with him? Awkward again if Wellgood, or\r\nsomebody put up by him, interrupts! If she doesn't come, that's at once\r\nadmitting something fishy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The woman's certainly a serious added difficulty. Meriton, we're old\r\nfriends. Tell me your own opinion.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't give an opinion for all time. The affair will die down, as all\r\naffairs do. The girl'll marry somebody else in time, I suppose. Wellgood\r\nwill get over his feelings. I'm not saying your son can't succeed you at\r\nHalton in due course. That would be making altogether too much of it.\r\nBut now, if the moment comes anywhere, say, in the next twelve\r\nmonths--well, I question if a change of air--and another\r\nconstituency--wouldn't be wiser.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so too--in his own interest. And I rather think that I, at\r\nleast, owe it to Vivien to throw my weight on the side that will save\r\nher from annoyance.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was in my mind too, Belfield; but I knew you'd think of it without\r\nmy saying it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe--I do really believe--that he will look at it in that light\r\nhimself. Any gentleman would; and he's that, outside his plaguy love\r\naffairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know he is; I know it. They bring such a lot of good fellows to\r\ngrief--and pretty women too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I must write to him; and you must look out for another\r\ncandidate.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, we must, and in quick time too! Apart from a General Election,\r\nI hear old Millington's sadly shaky. Well, good-bye, Belfield. My\r\nregards to your wife.\" He shook hands warmly. \"This is hard luck on you;\r\nbut he's got lots of time to pick up again. He'll end in the first\r\nflight yet. Cheer up. Better have a Prodigal than no son at all, like\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\n\"I imagine a good deal might be said on both sides in that debate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, stuff and nonsense! You wouldn't dare to say that to his mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"No; and I don't suppose I really think it myself. But this sort of\r\nthing does make a man a bit nervous, Meriton.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the lady's attractions have led him astray, perhaps they'll be able\r\nnow to keep him straight.\"\r\n\r\n\"They won't be so great in one particular. They won't be forbidden\r\nfruit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, the best fox is always in the covert you mayn't draw. Human\r\nnature!\"\r\n\r\n\"At all events, my boy Harry's.\"\r\n\r\nAnd for that nature Harry had to pay. The present price was an end of\r\nhis career in Meriton. One more voice joined the chorus, a powerful\r\nvoice. Belfield bowed his head to the decision. It was final for the\r\nmoment; in his depression of spirit he felt as though it were final for\r\nall time, as though his native town would know Harry no more. At any\r\nrate, now his place was vacant--the place from which he by transgression\r\nfell. It must be given to another. Only in Vivien's memory had he still\r\nhis niche.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXII.\r\n\r\nGRUBBING AWAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nGilly Foot's mind was so inventive, and his demand for ministerial\r\nassistance in carrying out his inventions so urgent, during the next\r\nthree weeks that Andy had little leisure for his own or anybody else's\r\nprivate affairs. The week-ends at Meriton had to be temporarily\r\nsuspended, and Meriton news reached him now by a word from Billy, who\r\nseemed to be in touch with Belfield, now through Jack Rock. Thus he\r\nheard from Billy that Harry Belfield was married and had gone abroad;\r\nwhile Jack sent him a copy of the local paper, with a paragraph (heavily\r\nmarked in blue pencil) to the effect that Mr. Harry Belfield, being\r\nadvised by his doctor to take a prolonged rest, had resigned his\r\nposition as prospective candidate for the Meriton Division. Decorous\r\nexpressions of regret followed, and it was added that probably Mr. Mark\r\nWellgood, Chairman of the Conservative Association, would be approached\r\nin the matter. Jack had emphasized his pencil-mark with a large note of\r\nexclamation, in which Andy felt himself at liberty to see crystallized\r\nthe opinion of Harry's fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nStill, though Meriton had for the time to be relegated mainly to memory,\r\nthere it had a specially precious pigeon-hole. It had regained for him\r\nall its old status of home. When he thought of holidays, it was of\r\nholidays at Meriton. When his thoughts grew ambitious--the progress of\r\nGilbert Foot and Co. began to justify modest ambitions--they pictured a\r\nsmall house for himself in or near Meriton, and a leisure devoted to\r\nthat ancient town's local affairs. To himself he was a citizen of\r\nMeriton more than of London; for to Andy London was, foremost of all, a\r\nplace of work. Its gaieties were for him occasional delights, rather\r\nthan a habitual part of the life it offered. Talks with Jack Rock and\r\nother old friends, visits to Halton and Nutley, completed the picture of\r\nhis future life at home. He was not a man much given to analysing his\r\nthoughts or feelings, and perhaps did not realize how very essential the\r\nsetting was to the attractiveness of the picture, nor that one part of\r\nthe setting gave the picture more charm than all the rest. Yet when\r\nAndy's fancy painted him as enjoying well-earned hours of repose at\r\nMeriton, the terrace by the lake at Nutley was usually to be seen in the\r\nforeground.\r\n\r\nLet Gilly clamour never so wildly for figures to be ready for him by the\r\nnext morning, in order that he might know whether the latest child of\r\nhis genius could be reared in this hard world or must be considered\r\nmerely as an ideal laid up in the heavens, an evening had to be found to\r\ngo and see the Nun as Joan of Arc--first as the rustic maid in that\r\nvillage in France (its name was on the programme), and then, in silver\r\narmour, exhorting the King of France (who was supposed to be on\r\nhorseback in the wings). The question of the Nun's horse was solved by\r\nan elderly white animal being discovered on the stage when the curtain\r\nrose--the Nun was assumed to have just dismounted (voluntarily)--and\r\nbeing led off to the blare of trumpets. This was for the second song, of\r\ncourse, and it was the second song which brought Miss Doris Flower the\r\ngreatest triumph that she had ever yet achieved. Its passing references\r\nto the favour of Heaven were unexceptionable in taste--so all the papers\r\ndeclared; its martial spirit stirred the house; its tune caught on\r\nimmensely; and, by a happy inspiration, Joan of Arc had (as she was\r\nhistorically quite entitled to have) a prophetic vision of a time when\r\nthe relations between her own country and England would be infinitely\r\nhappier than they were in the days of Charles VII. and Henry VI. This\r\nvision having fortunately been verified, the public applauded Joan of\r\nArc's sentiments to the echo, while the author and the management were\r\nvery proud of their skill in imparting this touch of \"actuality\" to the\r\nproceedings. Finally, the Nun was in excellent voice, and the silver\r\narmour suited her figure prodigiously well.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's a great go,\" said Miss Flower contentedly, when Andy went\r\nround to her room to see her. She draped a Japanese dressing-gown over\r\nthe silver armour, laid her helmet on the table, and lit a cigarette.\r\n\"It knocks the Quaker into a cocked hat, and makes even the Nun look\r\nsilly. The booking's enormous; and it's something to draw them here,\r\nwith that Venus-rising-from-the-foam girl across the Square. I'm told,\r\ntoo, that she appears to have chosen a beach where there are no by-laws\r\nin force, Andy.\"\r\n\r\nAndy explained that he had not much leisure for even the most attractive\r\nentertainments.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" she proceeded, \"that something very funny--I shan't want\r\nyou for ten minutes, Mrs. Milsom\" (this to her dresser, who discreetly\r\nwithdrew)--\"has happened about Billy Foot? I don't mind telling you, in\r\nconfidence, that at Meriton I thought he was going to break out. With\r\nhalf an opportunity he would have. Since we came back I've only seen him\r\ntwice, and then he tried to avoid me. His usual haunts, Andy, know him\r\nonly occasionally, and then in company which, to my mind, undoubtedly\r\nhas its home in Kensington.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with him, I wonder? Now you remind me, I've hardly\r\nseen him either.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was here the other night, in a box, with Kensington; but he didn't\r\ncome round. Took Kensington on to supper, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you against Kensington?\" Andy inquired curiously.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing at all. Only I've observed, Andy, that taking Kensington out is\r\na prelude to matrimony. I could tell you a dozen cases in my own\r\nknowledge. You hadn't thought of that? In certain fields my experience\r\nis still superior to yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very much so! Do you suspect any particular Kensingtonian?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was a tall dark girl, rather pretty; but I couldn't look much.\r\nWell, we shall miss Billy if it comes off, but I imagine we can rely\r\nimplicitly on Gilly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've heard that Harry's married to Miss Vintry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Serve her right!\" said the Nun severely. \"I never had any pity for that\r\nwoman.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he's chucked the candidature. So our great campaign was all for\r\nnothing!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Billy must always be talking somewhere, anyhow. And I should\r\nthink it did you good?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, it did. I was thinking of Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"In my opinion it's about time you got out of that habit. Now you must\r\ngo, or you'll make me too late to get anything to eat. As you may guess,\r\nwearing this shell involves a fundamental reconstruction before I can\r\npresent myself at supper.\"\r\n\r\nAndy took her hand and pressed it. \"I'm so jolly glad you've got such a\r\nsuccess, Doris. And the armour's ripping!\"\r\n\r\nThere followed three weeks of what Gilly Foot, over his lunch at the\r\nrestaurant and his dinner at the Artemis, used to describe as\r\n\"incredible grind for both of us.\" Then a day of triumph! The outcome of\r\nthe latest brilliant idea, the new scientific primer, was accepted as\r\nthe text-book in the County Council secondary schools. Gilly wore a\r\n_Nunc Dimittis_ air.\r\n\r\n\"Eton and Harrow! Pooh!\" said he. \"A couple of hundred copies a year\r\napiece, perhaps. Give me the County Council schools! The young masses\r\nbeing bred on Gilbert Foot and Co.--that's what I want. The proletariat\r\nis our game! If this spreads over the country, and I believe it will, we\r\nshall be rich men in no time, Andy.\"\r\n\r\nAndy was smiling broadly--not that he had any particular wish to be\r\nrich, but because successful labour is marvellously sweet.\r\n\r\n\"Do you happen to remember that it was you who gave me the germ of that\r\nidea?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, surely I didn't? I don't remember. I can't have, Gilly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, you did. That arrangement of the tables of comparison?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ah! Yes--well, I do remember something about that. But that's only\r\na trifle. You did all the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what's fetched them, though; I know it is.\" He gave a sigh.\r\n\"Andy, I shall grudge you that all the rest of my life.\" He put his head\r\non one side, and regarded his partner with a peaceful smile. \"You're a\r\nremarkable chap, you know. Some day or other I believe you'll end by\r\nmaking me work! Sometimes I kind of feel the infection creeping over me.\r\nI distinctly hurried lunch to-day to come back and talk about this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe we have got our foot in this time,\" said Andy.\r\n\r\n\"I shan't, however, do anything more to-day,\" Gilly announced, rising\r\nand putting on his hat. \"My nerves are somewhat over-stimulated. A walk\r\nin the park, a game of bridge, and a quiet little dinner are indicated.\r\nYou'll attend to anything that turns up, won't you, old chap?\"\r\n\r\nSlowly and gradually Andy Hayes was growing not only into his strength\r\nbut also into the consciousness of it. He was measuring his\r\npowers--slowly, suspiciously, distrustfully. His common sense refused to\r\nignore what he had done and was doing, but his modesty ever declined to\r\ngo a step beyond the facts. All through his life this characteristic\r\nabode with him--a sort of surprise that the simple qualities he\r\nrecognised in himself should stand him in such good stead, combined with\r\nan unwillingness rashly to pledge their efficacy in the greater labours\r\nof the future. Thus it came about that he was, so to say, a day behind\r\nthe world's estimate in his estimate of himself. When the people about\r\nhim were already sure, he was gradually reaching confidence--never the\r\nimperious self-confidence of commanding genius, which makes no question\r\nbut that the future will be as obedient to its sway as the past, but a\r\nvery sober trust in a proved ability, a trust based on no inner instinct\r\nof power, but solely on the plain experience that hitherto he had shown\r\nhimself equal to the business which came his way--equal to it if he\r\nworked very hard at it, took it seriously, and gave all he had to give\r\nto it. The degree of self-confidence thus achieved was never sufficient\r\nto make him seek adventures; by slow growth it became enough to prevent\r\nhim from turning his back on any task, however heavy, which the course\r\nof his life and the judgment of his fellows laid upon him. So step by\r\nstep he moved on in his development and in his knowledge of it. He\r\nrecognised now that it would have been a pity to pass his life as a\r\nbutcher in Meriton--that it would have been waste of material. But he\r\nwas still quite content to regard as a sufficient occupation, and\r\ntriumph, of that life the building-up of Gilbert Foot and Co.'s\r\neducational publishing connection; and he was still surprised to be\r\nreminded that he had contributed anything more than hard work to that\r\ntask, that it owed to him even the smallest scintilla of original\r\nsuggestion. Still there it was. Perhaps he would never do a thing like\r\nthat again. Very likely not. Still he had done it once. It passed from\r\nthe impossibles to the possibles--a possible under strict and\r\ndistrustful observation, but a possible that should be put to the proof.\r\n\r\nNothing in the business line turned up after Gilly had departed to\r\nrecruit his nerves. Having made one bold and successful leap, the\r\neducational publishing concern of Gilbert Foot and Co. seemed disposed\r\nto sit awhile on its haunches. Andy was the last man to quarrel with it\r\nfor that; he had all the primitive man's fear of things looking too\r\nrosy. Things had looked too rosy with Harry. And \"Nemesis! Nemesis!\" old\r\nBelfield had cried. By all means let the educational publishing concern\r\nrest on its haunches for awhile; the new scientific primer, with the\r\nquite original arrangement of its comparative tables, supplied a\r\ncomfortable cushion. It was five o'clock; Andy made bold to light his\r\npipe.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Belfield!\" announced the office-boy, twisting his head between the\r\ndoor and the jamb with a questioning air.\r\n\r\nWhat brought Belfield to town? \"Oh, show him in!\" said Andy, laying down\r\nhis pipe.\r\n\r\nNot Harry's father, as Andy had concluded, but Harry himself was the\r\nvisitor--Harry radiantly handsome, in a homespun suit of delicate gray\r\nwith a blue stripe in it, a white felt hat, a light blue tie--a look of\r\nperfect health and happiness about him.\r\n\r\n\"I was passing by--been in the City--and thought I must look you up, old\r\nchap,\" said Harry, clasping Andy's hand in unmistakably genuine\r\naffection. \"Seems years since we met! Well, a lot's happened to me, you\r\nsee. You didn't know I was in town, did you? Only passing through;\r\nIsobel and I have been in Paris--went there after the event, you\r\nknow--and we're off to Scotland to-morrow for some golf. She's got all\r\nthe makings of a player, Andy. And how are you? Grubbing away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Grubbing away\" most decidedly failed to express Gilbert Foot and Co.'s\r\nidea of what had happened in their office that day, but Andy found no\r\nleisure to dwell on any wound to his firm's corporate vanity. Here was\r\nthe old Harry! Harry as he had been in the early days of his engagement!\r\nThe Harry of that brief spell of good resolution, after Andy had\r\ndelivered to him a certain note! There was no trace at all--by way\r\neither of woe or of shame--of the Harry who had come to the Lion,\r\nseeking a place where Isobel Vintry might lay her head, craving for her\r\nthe charity of a night's lodging, and no questions asked!\r\n\r\nAndy's intelligence was brought to a full stop--sheer up against the\r\ndifficult question of whether it is worth while to worry about people\r\nwho are not worrying about themselves. Theologically, socially,\r\npolitically, it is correct to say yes; faced with an individual case,\r\nthe affirmative answer seems sometimes almost ridiculous; rather like\r\npressing an overcoat--or half your cloak, after the example of St.\r\nMartin of Tours--on a vagabond of exceptionally caloric temperament. He\r\nis naked, and neither ashamed nor cold. Must you shiver, or blush, for\r\nhim?\r\n\r\n\"I--er--ought to congratulate you, Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, old chap! Yes, it's very much all right. Things one's sorry\r\nfor, of course--oh, don't think I'm not sorry!--but the right road found\r\nat last, Andy! I suppose a fellow has to go through things like that.\r\nI'm not justifying myself, of course; I know I'm apt to--well, to put\r\noff doing the necessary thing if it's likely to cause pain to anybody.\r\nThat's a mistake, though an amiable one perhaps. But all that's over--no\r\nuse talking about it. When we get back to town, you must come and see\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nAndy remembered an old-time conversation about Lethe water. Harry seemed\r\ndisposed to stand treat for a bottle.\r\n\r\n\"I'm awfully sorry about--about the seat, Harry,\" he said.\r\n\r\nA faint frown of vexation marred Harry's comely contentment. \"Yes, but I\r\ndon't know that one isn't best out of it. A lot of grind, making\r\nyourself pleasant to a lot of fools! Oh, perhaps it's a duty; but it'll\r\nwait a bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not looking out elsewhere?\" Andy asked.\r\n\r\n\"Give a fellow time!\" Harry expostulated. \"I've only been married a\r\nfortnight! You must let me have a bit of a holiday. Oh, you needn't be\r\nafraid I shan't tackle it again soon--Isobel's awfully keen! And I hope\r\nto find a rather less dead-alive hole than Meriton.\" The faint frown\r\npersisted on his face; it seemed to hint that his mind harboured a\r\ngrudge against Meriton--something unpleasant had happened there. A\r\nperceptible, though slight, movement of his shoulders dismissed the\r\nungrateful subject. In a moment he had found a more pleasant one--a\r\ntheme for his kindliness to play on, secure from perturbing\r\nrecollections. His old friendly smile of encouragement and patronage\r\nbeamed on Andy.\r\n\r\n\"So you and Gilly are making it go? That's right! He's a lazy devil,\r\nGilly, but not a fool. And you're a good plodder. You remember I always\r\nsaid you'd make your way? I thought you would, even if you'd taken on\r\nold Jack's shop. But I expect you've got a better game here. Gilly\r\npleased with you?\" He laughed in his pleasantly conscious impudence.\r\n\r\n\"He hasn't given me the sack yet,\" said Andy.\r\n\r\n\"You did a lot of work for me, old fellow,\" Harry pursued. \"Sorry that,\r\nowing to circumstances, it's all wasted! Still it taught you a thing or\r\ntwo, I daresay?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what the Nun was saying the other night, when I went to see\r\nher show.\"\r\n\r\nHarry's faint frown showed again. His recollection of Miss Flower's\r\nbehaviour at Meriton accused her of a want of real sympathy.\r\n\r\n\"Ah yes! I don't know who they'll get; but I must have made the seat\r\nsafe. Just the way one works for another fellow sometimes! It doesn't do\r\nto complain.\"\r\n\r\nThe office-boy put his head in again--and his hand in front of his head.\r\n\"Wire just come, sir,\" he said to Andy, delivered the yellow envelope,\r\nand disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Open it, old fellow,\" said Harry, putting an exquisitely shod foot on\r\nthe table. \"Yes, another fellow will take my place; I've done the work,\r\nhe'll reap the reward. And he'll probably think he's done it all\r\nhimself!\"\r\n\r\nAndy fingered his telegram absently, not in impatience; nothing very\r\nurgent was to be expected, the great _coup_ had already been made. He\r\nlaid it down and listened again to Harry Belfield.\r\n\r\n\"Upon my soul,\" Harry went on, \"I rather envy you your life. A good\r\nsteady straight job--and only got to stick to it. Now I'm no sooner out\r\nof one thing--well out of it--than they begin to kick at me to start\r\nanother. The pater and Isobel are in the same story about it.\"\r\n\r\nHarry's face was now seriously clouded and his voice peevish. He had\r\nbeen through a great deal of trouble lately; he seemed to himself to be\r\nentitled to a rest, to a reasonable interval of undisturbed enjoyment.\r\nAnd he was being bothered about that career of his!\r\n\r\n\"Well, I suppose you oughtn't to miss the next election. The sooner you\r\ngo in the better, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not so easy to find a safe seat.\" Harry assumed that the\r\nconstituency which he honoured should be one certain properly to\r\nappreciate the compliment. \"I sometimes think I'd like to chuck the\r\nwhole thing, and enjoy my life in my own way. Oh, I'm only joking, of\r\ncourse; but when they nag, I jib, you know.\"\r\n\r\nAndy nodded, relit his pipe, and opened his telegram.\r\n\r\n\"That's why I think you're rather lucky to have it all cut and dried for\r\nyou. Saves a lot of thinking!\"\r\n\r\nAndy had been reading his telegram, not listening to Harry for the\r\nmoment. \"I beg pardon, Harry?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, read it. I'm only gassing,\" said Harry good-humouredly.\r\n\r\nAndy read again; he always liked to read important documents twice. He\r\nlaid it down on the office table, looking very thoughtful. \"That's\r\nfunny!\" he observed. \"It's from your father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't see why the pater shouldn't send you a telegram, if he\r\nwants to,\" smiled Harry.\r\n\r\n\"Asking me to go down to Meriton on Saturday and meet Lord Meriton,\r\nWigram, and himself.\" He took up the telegram and read the rest of the\r\nmessage--\"to discuss important suggestion of public nature affecting\r\nyourself. Personal discussion necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"To meet Meriton and Wigram?\" Wigram was the Conservative agent in the\r\nDivision. \"What the devil can they want?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Andy, \"unless--unless it's about the candidature.\"\r\n\r\n\"About what?\" Harry sharply withdrew the shapely foot from the table and\r\nsat upright in his chair.\r\n\r\n\"Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Still I don't see what else it can be\r\nabout. What else can there be of a public nature affecting me?\r\n'Affecting yourself' doesn't sound as if they only wanted my advice.\r\nBesides, why should they want my advice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's see the thing.\" Harry took it, read it, and flung it down\r\npeevishly. \"Why the deuce can't he say what he means?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, a wire's not always absolute secrecy in small towns, is it? And I\r\ndaresay they'd want the matter kept quiet till it was settled.\"\r\n\r\nHarry's mood of gay contentment, clouded once or twice before, seemed\r\nnow eclipsed. He sat tapping his boot impatiently with his stick. His\r\nfather's telegram--or Andy's interpretation of it--clearly did not\r\nplease him. In the abstract, of course, he had known that he would have\r\na successor in the place which he had given up, or from which he had\r\nfallen. It had never entered his head that anybody would suggest Andy\r\nHayes, his old-time worshipper and humble follower. He was not an\r\nungenerous man, but this idea demanded a radical readjustment of his\r\nestimate of the relative positions of Andy and himself. If Andy were to\r\nsucceed to what he had lost, it brought what he had lost very sharply\r\nbefore his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if that is the meaning of it, it certainly seems rather--rather a\r\nrum start, eh, Andy? New sort of game for you!\" He tried to make his\r\nvoice pleasant.\r\n\r\n\"It is--it would be--awfully kind of them to think of it,\" said Andy,\r\nnow smiling in candid gratification. \"And Wigram, as well as your\r\nfather, was highly complimentary about some of my speeches. But it would\r\nbe quite out of the question. I've neither the time nor the money.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a deuced expensive game,\" Harry remarked. \"And, of course, no end\r\nof work, especially in the next few months. And when you're in, it's not\r\nmuch good in these days, unless you can give all your time to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said Andy, nodding grave appreciation of all these\r\ndifficulties. \"It seems to me quite out of the question. Still, if that\r\nis what they mean, I can hardly refuse to discuss it. You see, it's a\r\nconsiderable compliment, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nHe was thinking the idea over in his steady way, and had not paid heed\r\nto Harry's altered mood. The objections Harry put forward were so in\r\ntune with his own mind that it did not strike him as at all odd that his\r\nfriend should urge them even zealously. \"In any event,\" he added, \"I\r\nshould have to be guided entirely by what Gilly Foot thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"What Gilly thought?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean whether he thought it would be compatible with the claims of the\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, you'd really think of it?\"\r\n\r\nThere was such unmistakable vexation, even scorn, in his voice now that\r\nAndy could not altogether miss the significance of the tone. He looked\r\nacross at Harry with an air of surprise. \"There's no harm in thinking a\r\nthing over. I always like to do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, of all the men I thought of as likely to step into my shoes, I\r\nnever thought of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the last thing I should ever have thought of either. You've\r\nsomething in your mind, haven't you? I hope you'll say anything you\r\nthink quite candidly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh well, since you ask me, old fellow, from the party point of view I\r\nthink there are--er--certain objections. I mean, in a place like Meriton\r\nfamily connections and so on still count for a good deal--on our side,\r\nanyhow.\"\r\n\r\nAndy nodded, again comprehending and admitting. \"Yes, I'm nobody; and my\r\nfather was nobody, from that point of view.\" He smiled. \"And then\r\nthere's Jack Rock!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be hurt with me, but I call myself a Tory, and I am one. Such\r\nthings do count, and I'm not ashamed to say I think they ought to. I've\r\nnever let them count in personal relations.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that, Harry. You may be sure I recognise that. And you're right\r\nto mention them now. I suppose they must have reckoned with them,\r\nthough, before they determined--if they have determined--to make me this\r\noffer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, thank heaven I'm out of it, and I wish you joy of it,\" said\r\nHarry, rising and clapping on his hat.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's not at all likely it'll come to anything. Must you go, Harry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm off.\" He paused for a moment. \"If it is what you think, you'd\r\nbetter look at it carefully. Don't let them persuade you against your\r\nown judgment. I consider Wigram an ass, and old Meriton is quite out of\r\ntouch with the Division.\" He forbore to comment on his own father, and\r\nwith a curt \"Good-bye\" departed, shutting the door rather loudly behind\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThis great day--the day which had both witnessed the triumph of the new\r\ntext-book and brought the telegram from Meriton--was a Thursday. Andy\r\nsent his answer that he would be at Halton on Saturday afternoon. He\r\ncould find no other possible interpretation of the summons, surprising\r\nas his first interpretation was. He was honestly pleased; it could not\r\nbe said that he was much puzzled. His answer seemed pretty plain--the\r\nthing was impossible. What did surprise him rather was the instinctive\r\nregret with which he greeted this conclusion. Such an idea had never\r\noccurred to his mind; when it was presented to him, he could not turn\r\naway without regret--nay, not without a certain vague feeling of\r\nself-reproach. If he seemed to them a possible leader, ought he to turn\r\nhis back on the battle? But of course they did not know his private\r\ncircumstances or the business claims upon him. Harry had been quite\r\nright about those, just as he had been about the desirability of family\r\nconnections--but not of family connections with Jack Rock.\r\n\r\nIt was quite out of the question; but, Andy being human and no more\r\nbusiness offering itself, he indulged in half an hour's reverie over it.\r\nHe shook his head at himself with a reproving smile for this vanity. But\r\nit would be pleasant to have the offer, and pleasant if they let him\r\nmention it to one or two friends. Jack Rock would be proud of it, and he\r\ncould not help thinking that perhaps Vivien Wellgood would be pleased.\r\nHis brow knit when he remembered that Harry Belfield had not seemed\r\npleased. Well, could he be expected to be pleased? \"To step into my\r\nshoes\" had been his phrase. Well, if men choose to take off fine new\r\nshoes and leave them lying about? Somebody will step into them. Why not\r\na friend? So he argued. A friend in regard to whom Harry had never\r\nallowed anything to interfere with his personal relations. That was just\r\nit. If a friend, he had also been a _protege_, the recipient of a kindly\r\ngenerous patronage, an equal by grace and not by right. Credit Harry\r\nBelfield with a generosity above the average, and yet he might feel a\r\npang at the idea of his former humble friend stepping into his shoes,\r\ntaking his place, becoming successor to what his folly had left vacant.\r\nAndy understood; and from that point of view he felt it was rather a\r\nrelief that the thing was in itself an impossibility. There was a triple\r\nimpossibility--the money, the time--and Gilly Foot!\r\n\r\nStill the text-book and the telegram had given him an interesting day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIII.\r\n\r\nA STOP-GAP.\r\n\r\n\r\nAndy felt that he ought not to go to Meriton without having possessed\r\nhimself of his partner's views. Any reluctance--even a reluctant\r\nassent--from Gilly would put an immediate end to the project. He was\r\nrather nervous about bringing the matter forward, fearing lest the mere\r\nidea of it, entertained by the junior partner, might seem treason in the\r\neyes of his senior in the growing business of Gilbert Foot and Co.\r\n\r\nThe interview held one or two surprises for him. In this affair Andy was\r\nto learn the worth of a band of resolute friends, and to begin to\r\nunderstand how much men will do for a man who has convinced them that he\r\ncan do things for himself also. For such a man the way is cleared of all\r\nbut inevitable difficulties. There is a conspiracy, partly\r\nself-interested, partly based on appreciation, to set him free to do the\r\nwork for which he is fitted; the conspirators both want the work done\r\nand are glad to help a fine worker.\r\n\r\nThe first surprise was that Gilly Foot was not at all surprised when\r\nAndy put before him a contingent case--in terms carefully hypothetical.\r\nIndeed his first words went far to abolish any contingent or\r\nhypothetical character in the discussion.\r\n\r\n\"So they've done it, have they?\" he drawled out. \"I thought they would,\r\nfrom something Billy said.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does Billy know about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, Billy knows. I expect they consulted him, in fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to be able to tell them that you agree with me; that's why I've\r\nspoken to you about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"By all means tell them I agree with you,\" yawned Gilly; he seemed more\r\nthan ordinarily lazy that morning--the reaction from the triumph of the\r\ntext-book still on him, no doubt. Yet there was a lurking gleam of\r\namusement in his eye.\r\n\r\n\"Apart from the money--and I haven't got it--it would take far too much\r\ntime. I'm pretty hard worked as it is, with the business opening up in\r\nthis way. I'm quite clear that it wouldn't be fair to the business--and\r\nnot fair to you either. I've slept on it, and I'm quite clear about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, are you? Then by no means tell them I agree with you.\"\r\n\r\nSurprise the second! \"You don't?\" Andy ejaculated; there was a note of\r\npleasure in his voice.\r\n\r\n\"I'm a lazy hound, I know,\" Gilly pursued. \"If there is another fellow\r\nto do the work, I let him do it. Perhaps some day, if we go on booming,\r\nwe can take in another fellow. If so, I shall certainly incite him to do\r\nthe work. Meanwhile I'm not such a lazy beast as to let you miss this\r\nchance on my account. My word, I should get it hot from Billy--and\r\nDoris!\" He stretched himself luxuriously. \"There's a perfectly plain way\r\nout of this; I must work.\" He looked up at his partner humorously.\r\n\"Though you mayn't believe it, I can work, when I want a thing very\r\nmuch.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is there for you to want here?\" asked Andy.\r\n\r\n\"Well, in the first place, we believe in you--perhaps we're wrong, but\r\nwe do. In the second--and there's no mistake about this--we think you're\r\na good chap, and we want you to have your chance. I shouldn't forgive\r\nmyself if I stood in your way here, Andy--and the others wouldn't\r\nforgive me either.\"\r\n\r\nAndy was standing by him; he laid his hand on his shoulder. \"You're a\r\ngood chap yourself, Gilly.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, as far as Gilbert Foot and Co. are concerned, you may consider the\r\nmatter settled. It's for you to tackle the other end of it--the Meriton\r\nend. And since you are here to-day, at all events, perhaps you won't\r\ntake it ill if I linger a little longer than usual over lunch--for which\r\nmeal it seems to me to be nearly time? I feel to-day a barely\r\nperceptible stirring of the brain which, properly treated, encouraged by\r\nadequate nourishment, might produce an idea. You wouldn't like to come\r\ntoo?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no. I've really got more than enough to do here.\"\r\n\r\nGilly strolled off, smiling serenely. He was ready to do himself\r\nviolence in the way of work when the time came, but there was really no\r\nneed to anticipate matters.\r\n\r\nGilly's knowledge and assent--it was more than assent; it was\r\nadvocacy--made the project real and present. Only the question of ways\r\nand means and of his own inclination remained. As to the latter Andy was\r\nno longer able to doubt. His pleasure at Gilly's attitude was indeed due\r\nin part to the affection for himself which it displayed, but it had been\r\ntoo eager to be accounted for wholly by that. His heart rejoiced because\r\nGilly set him free, so far as the business was concerned, to follow his\r\ndesire. Only that little book from the bank still held up its finger in\r\nits wonted gesture of cautious admonition. When it reckoned the figures\r\ninvolved, the little white book might be imagined to turn paler still.\r\n\r\nAt Meriton--where Andy arranged to spend the Saturday night with Jack\r\nRock--the conspiracy ruled, even as in London. Lord Meriton, Belfield,\r\nand Wigram met him with the air of men who had already considered and\r\novercome all difficulties.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, Mr. Hayes,\" said his lordship, \"we were fools over this\r\nbusiness, till Foot put us right. We tried the three or four possible\r\nmen in the Division, and for one reason or another none of them could\r\naccept. So, much against my will--indeed against my vote; I hate a\r\ncarpet-bagger--it was decided to approach headquarters and ask for a\r\nman. Luckily Belfield wrote first to Foot--\"\r\n\r\n\"And Billy Foot wrote back, asking what the dickens we wanted a man from\r\nLondon for, when we had the very man for the job under our noses down\r\nhere!\" He smiled rather sadly. \"Meriton has more than one string to its\r\nbow, Andy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've taken every pains to sound opinion, Mr. Hayes,\" said Wigram. \"It's\r\nmost favourable. Your speeches made an excellent impression. There will\r\nbe no difficulty in obtaining adoption by the Association, if you come\r\nforward under the proper auspices.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we'll look after the auspices,\" said Meriton. \"That'll be all\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I've no influence, no connections, no standing--\"\r\n\r\n\"We haven't flattered you, Mr. Hayes,\" Meriton interrupted, smiling.\r\n\"We've told you that we made efforts in other quarters.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it pleases you, Andy, you shall regard yourself as Hobson's choice,\"\r\nsaid Belfield, with a chuckle.\r\n\r\n\"Better than an outsider, anyhow!\" Mr. Wigram chimed in.\r\n\r\nAndy's modesty was again defeated. The Jack Rock difficulty, which had\r\nseemed so serious to Harry Belfield, was acknowledged--but acknowledged\r\nonly to be brushed on one side by a determined zeal.\r\n\r\n\"But I--I can't possibly afford it!\" Andy was in his last ditch, but\r\nthen it was a wide and formidable one. The conspirators, however,\r\nattacked it without the least dismay.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, now we can get down to business!\" said Belfield in a tone of\r\nrelief. \"This conversation is, of course, entirely confidential. We've\r\nlooked at matters from that point of view, and--er--taken some advice.\r\nWigram here says it can be done comfortably for twelve hundred--that's\r\ntwo hundred within the maximum. You needn't shake your head before I've\r\nfinished! We think you ought to put up some of it, and to guarantee a\r\ncertain sum annually towards Wigram's expenses. I'll tell you what we've\r\ndecided to ask you for--two-fifty for the contest, and a hundred a\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now just think it over, Mr. Hayes, and tell us if you see your way to\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the rest?\" asked Andy, half-bewildered; for the last great ditch\r\nlooked as if it were being stormed and crossed. Because--yes, he might\r\nbe able to--yes, with care, and prosperity at Gilbert Foot and Co.'s, he\r\ncould manage that!\r\n\r\nBelfield wrote on a bit of paper: \"Meriton, L250; Rock, L250; Belfield,\r\nL500.\" He pushed it across the table. \"That leaves a little margin. We\r\ncan easily raise the balance of the annual expenses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but I couldn't possibly--!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Andy, it's constantly being done,\" Belfield expostulated.\r\n\r\n\"Our friend Belfield, for reasons that you'll appreciate, feels that he\r\nwould like to bear a share of the expenses of this fight, which\r\nunder--well, other circumstances--would naturally have fallen entirely\r\non him. My contribution is given for public reasons, Mr. Hayes, though\r\nI'm very glad that it should be of service to you personally.\" Meriton\r\nbroke into a smile. \"I expect I needn't tell you why old Jack Rock's\r\nname is there. We should have got into pretty hot water if we hadn't let\r\nhim into it!\"\r\n\r\nBelfield leant over to Andy, and said in a lowered voice, \"Atonement's\r\ntoo strong a word, Andy, but I don't want the party to suffer through\r\nanything that's occurred. I don't want it left in the lurch. I think\r\nyou'd like to help me there, wouldn't you?\"\r\n\r\nHarry's father was against Harry. Harry's father urged him to step into\r\nHarry's shoes.\r\n\r\n\"I think we've made you a practical proposition; it tides us over the\r\nnext election anyhow, Mr. Hayes. By the time another Parliament has run\r\nits course, I hope you'll be in a position where ways and means will\r\npresent no difficulty. Soon enough to think about that when the time\r\ncomes, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I can guarantee you success, Mr. Hayes,\" said Wigram.\r\n\r\nAll the difficulties seemed to have vanished--if only he could take the\r\noffered help.\r\n\r\n\"I feel rather overwhelmed,\" he said slowly.\r\n\r\nMeriton shrugged his shoulders. \"We must hold the seat. If you don't let\r\nus do this for you we shall probably have to do it for some fellow we\r\nnever saw, or else put up with some bounder who's got nothing to\r\nrecommend him except his money. I don't want to press you unduly, Mr.\r\nHayes, but in my opinion, if your private affairs don't make it\r\nimpossible, it's your duty to accept. Would you like time to consider?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just five minutes, if you don't mind, Lord Meriton.\"\r\n\r\nBelfield winked at Meriton. If he had asked for a week! Five minutes\r\nmeant a favourable answer.\r\n\r\nAll the factors were before him; they could be judged in five minutes.\r\nIt was a venture, but Meriton said it was his duty. Nobody could tell\r\nwhere it would lead, but it was honourable work, for which responsible\r\nmen thought him fitted. It was Harry's shoes, but they were empty. That\r\nlast thought made him speak.\r\n\r\n\"If I accept, and win, I hold the seat at the disposal of those who've\r\nchosen me for it.\" Half-consciously he addressed himself especially to\r\nBelfield. \"If at any time--\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew you'd feel that way about it; but at present, at all events,\r\nit's not a practical question, Andy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm grateful for your confidence,\" Andy said, now turning to Meriton.\r\n\"Since you think me fit for it, I'll take it and do my best with it,\r\nLord Meriton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Capital!\" his lordship exclaimed. Wigram's face was wreathed in smiles.\r\nBelfield patted Andy on the shoulder affectionately.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe either party to the bargain will regret it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know Mr. Hayes will have an honourable, and I believe he will have a\r\ndistinguished, career,\" Meriton said, and, rising from his chair, broke\r\nup the council.\r\n\r\nAndy lingered for a little while alone with Belfield, to thank him\r\nagain, to make some arrangements for the future, to tell him that he had\r\nseen Harry, and that Harry was well and in good spirits.\r\n\r\n\"You saw him on Thursday? After you got my wire? Did you say anything\r\nabout it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It came while he was there, and I showed it to him. He was surprised.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean he wasn't pleased?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can understand how he must feel. I feel just the same thing\r\nmyself--terribly strongly sometimes.\"\r\n\r\nBelfield pressed his arm. \"You mustn't give way to that feeling. It's\r\nloyal, but it's not reasonable. Never let that weigh with you in\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\nThe feeling might not be reasonable; it seemed to Andy inevitable. It\r\nmust weigh with him. Yet it could not outweigh his natural and\r\nlegitimate satisfaction that day. His mind reached forth to the new\r\nwork, fortified by the confidence that his friends gave him. The thought\r\nof Harry seemed now rather a sobering reminder that this thing had come\r\nto him, in part at least, by accident. He was the more bound to do well\r\nwith it, that the evil effects of the accident might be minimized.\r\n\r\nHe made for Jack Rock's house in High Street, where he was to lodge.\r\nJack had just got off his horse at the door, and was standing facing his\r\nshop, apparently regarding his sign. Andy came up and clapped him on the\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"I know what you've been doing,\" he said. \"At it again, Jack!\"\r\n\r\n\"You've not refused?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I've accepted.\"\r\n\r\nJack wrung his hand hard. \"That takes a weight off my mind,\" he said\r\nwith a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"But it seems a low-down thing to take all that money--more of yours\r\ntoo!\"\r\n\r\nJack smiled triumphantly. \"Well, I happen to be a bit flush o' cash just\r\nnow--that's the truth, Andy--so you needn't mind. D'ye see that sign?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I do, Jack. What's the matter with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, in a month that sign'll come down.\" He cocked his head on one\r\nside as he regarded it. \"Yes, down in a month! Seems strange, don't it?\r\nBeen there sixty year.\" His sigh was evenly compounded of sorrow and\r\npride.\r\n\r\n\"What, are you going to retire, Jack?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not pressin' it on you again! Don't be afraid. To think of my\r\nhavin' done that! You as are goin' to Parliament! Lord, it's a great\r\nday, Andy! Come in and have a glass o' beer.\" He led the way to his back\r\nroom, and the cask was called upon to do its duty. \"I've sold out,\r\nAndy,\" Jack announced. \"Sold out to a concern that calls itself the\r\nNational, Colonial, and International Purveyors, Limited. That'll look\r\nwell on the sign, won't it? Four thousand pound they're payin' me, down\r\non the nail, besides pensionin' off old Simpson. Well, it's worth the\r\nmoney, if they can do as well with it as I've done. The house here is\r\nthrown in--they mean to enlarge the shop.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where are you going to set up house, Jack?\"\r\n\r\nJack winked in great enjoyment. \"Know of a certain house where a certain\r\nold gentleman used to live--him as kept the grammar school--Mr. Hayes,\r\nB.A. Oxon? The old house in Highcroft, Andy! It's on the market, and I'm\r\ngoin' to buy it--to say nothin' of a nice range of stablin' opposite.\r\nAnd there, if you'll accept of 'em, Andy, you'll have your own pair o'\r\nrooms always ready for you, when you're down at Meriton over your\r\npolitics. Parlour and bedroom, there they'll be, and I shan't disturb\r\nyou. And when I'm gone, there's the old house for you. There's nobody\r\npoor Nancy would have been so glad to see in it.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a lump in Andy's throat, and he was not ashamed of it. The\r\nregard and love of his friends seemed to have been very much with him in\r\nthe last few days, and to have done great things for him. Old Jack\r\nRock's affectionate cunning touched him closely.\r\n\r\n\"I really think I'm the luckiest beggar alive!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Folks mostly make their luck,\" said Jack. \"You've made yours. There was\r\nno call on any of us to fret ourselves about you. You could have gone\r\nback to Canada and made your way for yourself--if it hadn't been that we\r\ngot to want to keep you, Andy.\" He paused, drank his beer, and added,\r\n\"Aye, but I shall feel a bit strange the day that sign comes down, and\r\nI've no more to say to the meat--only the horses! I've lived with the\r\nmeat, man and boy, nigh on sixty year.\"\r\n\r\nWith a promise to return in good time for supper--for no risks must be\r\nrun with what might be one of the last of Mr. Rock's own joints of beef\r\nthat he would ever be privileged to eat--Andy left him and took the road\r\nto Nutley. He remembered Vivien's invitation; he looked forward to\r\ntelling her his news, the great things that had been happening to him in\r\nthe last three days. But he wanted yet more to meet her again; he had\r\nnot seen her since the day after the catastrophe. Harry he had seen, and\r\nHarry had been happy, in high spirits, quite self-contented, until that\r\nuntoward telegram eclipsed his gaiety. Would the interval of a few brief\r\nweeks have wrought a like change in her? It could not be looked for.\r\nHarry effected such transformations with a celerity peculiar to himself.\r\nStill there was room to hope for some lightening of her sorrow. Andy\r\nhoped to find it, and would approve of it. His mind was for the mean,\r\nfor moderation, in all emotions. If he resented Harry's gaiety, unending\r\nunlifting woe was hardly more congenial to his temper, and certainly\r\nmuch more troublesome to deal with tactfully. Harry's implicit negation\r\nof responsibility had at least the merit of inviting other people not to\r\nmake too much of his mischances.\r\n\r\nWhat his changing moods--his faculty of emotional oblivion--did in truth\r\nfor Harry, pride effected in outward seeming for Vivien. Some credit,\r\ntoo, must be given to Wellgood's training and Isobel's able\r\nco-operation. The discipline of the stiff upper lip redeemed some of its\r\nharshness by coming to her rescue now. Never had she held her head so\r\nhigh in Meriton as in the days that followed the announcement of Harry\r\nBelfield's marriage with Isobel Vintry. A poor, maimed, stunted\r\nannouncement, compared with the column and a half of description,\r\nguests, presents, and felicitations which would have chronicled her\r\nwedding! Five lines in the corner of the local paper--an item of news\r\nfor such of the population as did not see the London papers--it was\r\nenough to make Vivien fence herself about against any show of pity. To\r\ndo Meriton justice, it understood which of the pair had suffered the\r\ngreater loss. That Miss Wellgood was \"well out of it,\" but that Mr.\r\nHarry had \"done for himself,\" was the prevailing verdict; somewhat\r\naffected, it is to be feared, by the adventitious circumstance that\r\nIsobel was \"the companion\"--a drop to obscurity for brilliant Mr. Harry!\r\n\r\nBut the marriage dug deeper than to affect mere seeming. Besides\r\nerecting the useful barrier of impossibility, it raised the fence of an\r\ninward pride--or, rather, of that fastidiousness which Wellgood and\r\nIsobel had striven to eradicate. In that matter it was good for Vivien\r\nthat they had failed. To allow herself to remember, to muse, to\r\nlong--for whom? No more simply for Harry Belfield. In that name there\r\nwere allurements for musing and for longing. But the bearer of it had\r\ncontracted for himself now a new designation. It did him and his memory\r\nno good. Isobel Vintry's husband! The new character did much to strip\r\nhim of his romantic habiliments. He was brought down to earth; he could\r\nno more float before the eyes, a dazzling though unprofitable figure,\r\nproceeding in a brilliant callousness to the wrecking of other hearts.\r\nThere is always a touch of the ridiculous about Don Juan married, or Sir\r\nGawain Light-of-Love bound in chains in whose forging the Church has\r\nlent a hand to Cupid. And married to Isobel Vintry, who had stolen\r\nkisses behind the door! In a moral regard perhaps it is sad to say, but\r\nwe easier forgive our own romantic wrongs when they may be supposed to\r\nform but a link in a series. She would have found it harder to despise\r\nHarry, if he had served Isobel after the same fashion as he had served\r\nherself. She knew it not, but perhaps Harry was entitled to ask her to\r\nwait for just a little while! As the case stood--to weep for Isobel's\r\nhusband! The stiff upper lip which had been inculcated joined forces\r\nwith the fastidiousness that had never been uprooted. She chid herself\r\nfor every memory of Harry; every pang of envy for Isobel demanded from\r\nherself a discipline more stern than Isobel's own had ever supplied to\r\nmeet Wellgood's theories of a manly training.\r\n\r\nWellgood was proud of his daughter and of his theories, readily claiming\r\nfor his system of education the joint result of its success and of its\r\nfailure--of the courage and of the fastidiousness alike. But the plague\r\nof it was that the thought of the training brought with it the memory of\r\nthe preceptress who had so ably carried out his orders. Wellgood admired\r\nhis daughter--and envied her. He burned still with a fierce jealousy;\r\nfor him no appeasement lay in the marriage.\r\n\r\nYet between Vivien and Andy Hayes silence about the past could be no\r\nmore than silence--merely a refraining from words, no real\r\nforgetfulness, no true putting aside. For with that past would go their\r\nold relationship to one another; its roots had grown from that soil, and\r\nit flourished still by the strength of it. At the start their common\r\nmemories could envisage no picture without Isobel's face finding a place\r\non the canvas; later, Harry was inevitably the central figure of the\r\ncomposition. If Andy had pitied and sought to comfort, if Vivien had\r\ngiven confidence and accepted sympathy, it had always, in some sort or\r\nanother, been in regard to one of these two figures--in the later days,\r\nto both of them. Still they met, as it were, encumbered by these\r\nmemories, she to him Isobel's pupil, Harry's lover, he to her Harry's\r\nfollower, even though her own partisan against Isobel. It was hard to\r\nget their relations on to an independent footing; to be interested in\r\none another for one another's sake, without that outside reference,\r\nwhich had now become mere matter of memory--and best not remembered; to\r\nfind in one another and not elsewhere the motive of their intercourse\r\nand the source of a new friendship. The old kindliness must be\r\ntransplanted to a fresh soil if it were to blossom into a life\r\nself-sufficient and underived.\r\n\r\nThe line of thought was hers rather than his, at least more explicit and\r\nrealized for her than for him. When he thought of Harry--or of Isobel\r\nand Harry--it was with intent to avoid giving pain by an incautious\r\nreference; her mind demanded a direct assertion that the pair of them\r\nwere done with, and that she and he met on the ground of a new and\r\nstrictly mutual interest.\r\n\r\nShe had no thought, no dream, of more than friendship. The past was too\r\nrecent, her heart still too sore. Yet the sore heart instinctively seeks\r\nbalm; the wounded flower of pride will raise its head in grateful answer\r\nto a gleam of sunshine or a drop of rain. Andy's shy surety that she\r\nwould rejoice in his luck, because aforetime he had grieved for her\r\ntribulation, struck home to a heart hungry for comradeship.\r\n\r\nThus by her pride, and by her will answering the call of her pride, she\r\nwas different. She no longer merely suffered, was no longer passive to,\r\nkindness or cruelty. He knew the change as soon as she came to him, in\r\nthat very room which had witnessed the first stolen kiss, and, holding\r\nher hand out to him, cried, \"Mr. Andy, you've not refused? There's no\r\nwelcome for you in this house if you've refused. Father and I are quite\r\nagreed about it!\"\r\n\r\nAndy pressed her hand--Harry would have kissed it. \"You know? I couldn't\r\nrefuse their kindness. If I had, yours would have made me sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's good of you to spare time to come and tell us.\"\r\n\r\nAndy's answer had the compelling power of unconscious sincerity. \"That\r\nseemed about the first thing to do,\" he said, with a simple\r\nunembarrassed laugh.\r\n\r\nThe girl blushed, a faint yet vivid colour came on her cheeks. She drew\r\nback a little. Andy's words were, in their simplicity, bolder far than\r\nhis thoughts. Yet in drawing back she smiled. But Andy had seen the\r\nblush. Successful man as he had now become--big with promise as he was,\r\nat all events--in this field he was a novice. His blush answered\r\nhers--and was of a deeper tint. \"I'm afraid that's awfully\r\npresumptuous?\" he stammered.\r\n\r\n\"Why, we've all been waiting to hear the news! Father had the offer--you\r\nknow that? But he couldn't stand London. Then they asked Mr. Foot's\r\nadvice. He said it ought to be you. You do your best to prevent people\r\nthinking of you, but as soon as you're suggested--why, it's obvious.\"\r\n\r\n\"You really think I shan't make a fool of myself?\" asked Andy.\r\n\r\nThe delicate flush was still on her cheeks. \"You'll make me very much\r\nashamed of myself if you do,\" she answered. \"Is my opinion to be as\r\nwrong as all that? Haven't I always trusted you?\"\r\n\r\nHis surroundings suddenly laid hold on him. It was the very room--she\r\nstood on the very spot--where he had witnessed Harry's first defection,\r\nher earliest betrayal.\r\n\r\n\"It seems--it seems\"--he stammered--\"it seems treason.\"\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a minute. The colour glowed brighter on her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care to hear you say that,\" she told him, daintily haughty. \"I\r\nwas waiting here to congratulate you--yes, I hoped you'd come. I've\r\nnothing to do with anybody except the best candidate! They say you're\r\nthat. I had my good wishes ready for you. Will you take them--without\r\nreserve?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I say things wrong,\" pleaded poor Andy. \"I'll take anything you'll\r\ngive.\"\r\n\r\nHer face flashed into a smile. \"Your wrong things are--well, one can\r\nforgive them. It's all settled then--and you're to be the M.P.?\"\r\n\r\nAndy was still apologetic. \"They know what to do, I suppose. It seems\r\ncurious. Wigram says it's a certainty too. They've all joined in to\r\nhelp--Lord Meriton, Mr. Belfield, and old Jack. I'm much too poor by\r\nmyself, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"The man who makes friends makes riches.\" She gave a light laugh. \"May I\r\nbe a little bit of your riches?\"\r\n\r\nAndy's answer was his own. \"Well, I always remember that morning--the\r\nhunt and Curly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm still that to you?\" she asked quickly, her colour rising yet.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her. \"No, of course not, but I had a sort of idea that then\r\nyou liked me a bit.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked across the room at him--Andy was a man who kept his distance.\r\n\"You've been a refuge in time of trouble,\" she said. Her voice was soft,\r\nher eyes bright. \"We won't talk of the old things any more, will we?\"\r\n\r\nWellgood stood in the window. \"Well, is it all right?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"He's said yes, father!\" she cried with a glad merriment.\r\n\r\n\"I thought he would. It's a change for the better!\"\r\n\r\nHis blunt words--in truth they were brutal according to his\r\nbrutality--brought silence. Andy flushed into a painful red--not for his\r\nown sake only.\r\n\r\n\"I've got to try to be as good a stop-gap as I can,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Something better than that!\" Vivien murmured softly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIV.\r\n\r\nPRETTY MUCH THE SAME!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the following year Miss Doris Flower returned from an\r\nextensive professional tour in America. She had enjoyed great success.\r\nThe Nun and the Quaker proved thoroughly to the taste of transatlantic\r\naudiences; Joan of Arc did not at first create the same enthusiasm in\r\nthe United States as she had in London, the allusion to the happier\r\nrelations between France and England naturally not exciting quite equal\r\ninterest. However an ingenious gentleman supplied the Maid with a vision\r\nof General Lafayette instead; though not quite so up-to-date, it more\r\nthan answered expectations. Across the Canadian border-line the original\r\nvision was, of course, restored, and went immensely. It was all one to\r\nMiss Flower what visions she had, so that they were to the liking of the\r\npublic. She came back much pleased with herself, distinctly affluent,\r\nand minded to enjoy for awhile a well-earned leisure. Miss Sally Dutton\r\nreturned with her, charged with a wealth of comment on American ways and\r\ninstitutions, the great bulk of which sensible people could attribute\r\nonly to the blackest prejudice.\r\n\r\nThe lapse of six months is potent to smooth small causes of awkwardness\r\nand to make little changes of feeling or of attitude seem quite natural.\r\nBilly Foot had undoubtedly avoided the Nun for the last few weeks before\r\nher departure; he saw no reason now why he should not be among the\r\nearliest to call and welcome his old friend. It was rather with a\r\nhumorous twinkle than with any embarrassment that, when they settled\r\ndown to talk, he asked her if she happened to know the Macquart-Smiths.\r\n\r\n\"Of Kensington?\" asked the Nun in a tone of polite interest.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Kensington Palace Gardens,\" Billy replied, tranquilly unconscious\r\nof any other than the obvious bearing of the question. \"I thought you\r\nmust have heard of them.\" (The Nun never had, though she had seen at\r\nleast one of them.) \"The old man made a pile out in Mexico. They're very\r\ngood sort of people.\"\r\n\r\n\"You brought one of the girls to hear me one night, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Well, she's the only girl, in fact--Amaranth's her name. Rather\r\nsilly, but that's not her fault, is it?\" He seemed anxious to forestall\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\n\"You can call her Amy--or even Aimee,\" suggested the Nun consolingly.\r\n\r\nBilly laughed. \"Have you heard it, or did you guess, Doris?\"\r\n\r\n\"Guessed it. I can guess any conundrum, however baffling. I'm awfully\r\nglad, Billy. I'm sure you'll be tremendously happy. When did it\r\nhappen--and when is it going to happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"About a month ago--and in about three months' time. Didn't you think\r\nher pretty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very pretty,\" said the Nun, presuming on a somewhat cursory inspection\r\nof Miss Amaranth. \"And I suppose that since the old man made his\r\npile--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, there are two sons. Still--yes, that's all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"It all sounds splendid. I don't fall in love myself, as I've told\r\nyou--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know that very well,\" said Billy. \"Nobody knows it better.\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes danced as she shook her head at him demurely. \"But I like to\r\nsee young people settling down happily.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are rather a queer girl in that way, Doris. Never feel that way?\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun considered. \"I might go so far as to admit that I've an ideal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather a silly thing to have in this world, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Happiness makes you unsympathetic, Billy. There's no harm in an ideal\r\nif you're careful to keep it as an ideal. Of course if you try to make\r\nit practical there are awful risks.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what, or who, is your ideal?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Pray what is that to you?'\" the Nun quoted, under the circumstances\r\nrather maliciously. \"I find having an ideal a most comfortable\r\narrangement. It doesn't worry either him or me--and Sally can't possibly\r\nobject to it. How are things at Meriton? Andy wrote me his great news,\r\nand of course I never answered. But isn't it splendid?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't had time to go down lately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, of course not--now!\"\r\n\r\n\"But I hear he's doing magnificently. Sure to get in. But Gilly's the\r\nbest fun. When Andy is off electioneering, Gilly works like a horse.\r\nSandwiches in the office for lunch, with a glass of sherry from the pub\r\nround the corner! I caught him at it once; he was awfully disgusted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gilly lunching on sandwiches and a glass of sherry from the pub!\" Her\r\nvoice was full of wondering amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he won't hear the last of that in a hurry! When he did come to\r\nlunch the other day, we all went early and had a nice little pile of ham\r\nsandwiches and a liqueur glass of Marsala ready for him when he came in.\r\nYou should have seen his face--and not heard his language!\" The\r\nunnatural brother laughed. \"You see, Andy didn't want to stand because\r\nof neglecting the business, and Gilly backed himself to take on the work\r\nso as not to stand in Andy's way. And he's doing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that's awfully fine of Gilly, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is, of course. That's why he gets so riled when anybody says\r\nanything about it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun nodded in understanding. \"And Harry?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"They were abroad or in Scotland all the winter; came back to town about\r\na month ago. They've taken a flat in Clarges Street for the season, I\r\nbelieve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you been to call on Mrs. Harry Belfield?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, no, I haven't. I don't know what he wants. I think I'll leave him\r\nto begin. It seems to be the same old game with him. One sees him\r\neverywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"With her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes with her. I don't think he's doing anything about another\r\nconstituency; seems to have chucked it for the present. But he does\r\nappear to be having a very good time in London.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he friendly when you meet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he's friendly and jolly enough.\" Billy smiled. \"It's true that\r\nhe's generally in a hurry. When I met him with her once, he was in too\r\nmuch of a hurry to stop!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's very sad, but I'm afraid his memories of us are not those of\r\nunmixed pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid not. Andy says he never goes down to Meriton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, really I don't very well see how he could--with her!\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose he and his people have some understanding about it. One's\r\nsorry for them, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I shall go down to Meriton again this autumn. Any chance of\r\nyour being there--as a family man?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've promised to speak for Andy, so we may put in a few days there.\r\nMost of the time I shall have to be preaching to my own flock. I say,\r\nwill you come and meet Amaranth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I will. But really I think I should make it 'Amy'!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's worth considering; but I don't know how she'll feel about it,\"\r\nsaid Billy cautiously.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, said in the way you'll say it, it'll sound sweet,\" remarked the Nun\r\nflippantly.\r\n\r\nBilly still looked doubtful; perhaps \"Amaranth\" already sounded sweet.\r\n\r\nWhen left alone, Miss Flower indulged herself for awhile in a reverie of\r\na pensive, hardly melancholy, character--not unpleasant, rather\r\nphilosophical. Billy Foot's new state was the peg from which it hung,\r\nits theme the balance of advantage between the single and the married\r\nstate. It was in some degree a drawback to the former that other people\r\nwould embrace the latter. Old coteries were thus broken up; old\r\nfriendships, if not severed, yet rendered less intimate. New comrades\r\nhad to be found, not always an easy task. There was a danger of\r\nloneliness. On the other hand, there were worse things than loneliness;\r\nenforced companionship, where companionship had become distasteful,\r\nseemed to her distinctly one of them. Being so very much in another\r\nperson's hands also was a formidable thing; it involved such a liability\r\nto be hurt. The balance thus inclined in favour of the single life, in\r\nspite of its liability to loneliness. The Nun gave her adhesion to it,\r\nwith a mental reservation as to the case of an ideal. And even then--the\r\nattempt to make it practical? She shook her head with a little sigh,\r\nthen smiled. \"I wonder if Billy had any idea whom I had in my head!\" she\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nSally Dutton came in and found her friend in this ruminative mood. Doris\r\nroused herself to communicate the news of Billy Foot's engagement. It\r\nwas received in Sally's usual caustic manner. \"Came to tell you about\r\nit, did he? I wonder how much he's told her about you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't complain if my want of responsiveness hasn't been emphasised,\r\nSally. You couldn't expect him to.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been having a talk with Mrs. Harry Belfield,\" said Sally, taking\r\noff her hat.\r\n\r\nThis announcement came rather pat on the Nun's reflections. She was\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\n\"Well, how is she? What happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"In my opinion it's just another of them,\" Sally pronounced.\r\n\r\nBeing engaged in shopping at certain \"stores\" which she frequented, she\r\nhad gone into the tea-room to refresh her jaded energies, and had found\r\nherself at the next table to Isobel. Friendly greetings had passed; the\r\ntwo had drunk their tea together--with other company, as presently\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n\"What made you think that?\" There was no need to inquire what it was\r\nthat Sally thought when she spoke of \"another of them;\" she did not\r\nrefer to ideally successful unions.\r\n\r\nSally wrinkled her brow. \"She said they'd had a delightful winter,\r\ntravelling and so on, and that she was having a very gay time in London,\r\ngoing everywhere and making a heap of friends. She said they liked their\r\nflat, but were looking out for a house. She said Harry was very well and\r\njolly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that sounds all right. What's the matter, Sally? Not that I\r\npretend to be particularly anxious for her unruffled happiness. I don't\r\nwant anything really bad, of course, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Set your mind at ease; she won't be too happy to please you--and she\r\nknows it.\" Miss Dutton considered. \"At least she's a fool if she doesn't\r\nknow it. Who do you think came in while we were at tea?\"\r\n\r\n\"Harry?\" suggested the Nun, in an obviously insincere shot at the\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\"Harry at Harrod's! Mrs. Freere! You remember Mrs. Freere?--Mrs. Freere,\r\nand a woman Mrs. Freere called 'Dear Lady Lucy.'\" Sally's sarcastic\r\nemphasis on the latter lady's title--surely a harmless social\r\ndistinction?--was absolutely savage.\r\n\r\n\"Did they join you?\" asked the Nun, by now much interested.\r\n\r\n\"Join us? They swallowed us! Of course they didn't take much notice of\r\nme. They'd never heard of 'Miss Dutton,' and I didn't suppose I should\r\nmake a much better impression if I told them that I lived with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, of course not, Sally,\" said the Nun, and drew up on the edge of an\r\nill-timed gurgle. \"Mrs. Freere's an old story. Who's Lady Lucy? One of\r\nthe heap of friends Mrs. Harry is making?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lady Lucy's young--younger than Isobel. Mrs. Freere isn't young--not so\r\nyoung as Isobel. Mrs. Freere's the old friend, Lady Lucy's the new one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you gather whether Lady Lucy was a married woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes. She referred to 'our money troubles,' and 'my motor-car.' She's\r\nmarried all right! But nobody bothered to tell me her name. Well, as I\r\nsay, Mrs. Freere's the old friend, and she's the new friend. They're\r\nfighting which of them shall run the Belfields--I don't know what else\r\nthey may be fighting about! But they unite in sitting on Isobel. Harry's\r\ngiven her away, I gathered--told them what she was before he married\r\nher. So, of course, she hasn't got a chance! The only good thing is that\r\nthey obviously hate one another like poison. In fact I don't think I\r\never sat at a table with three women who hated one another more--though\r\nI've had some experience in that line.\"\r\n\r\n\"She hates them both, you think? Well, I shouldn't have thought she was\r\nthe kind of woman to like being sat upon by anybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she's fighting; she's putting up a good fight for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we know she can do that!\" observed the Nun with a rather acid\r\ndemureness.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not asking you to sympathise. I'm just telling you how it is.\r\n'Harry likes this,' says Mrs. Freere. 'He always did.' 'Did he, dear? He\r\ntells me he likes the other now,' says Lady Lucy. 'I don't think he's\r\nreally fond of either of them,' says Isobel. 'Oh yes, my dear. Besides,\r\nyou must, if you want to do the right thing,' say both of them. I\r\nsuppose that, when they once get her out of the way, they'll fight it\r\nout between themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will they get her out of the way? It's rather soon to talk about that.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll probably both of them be bowled over by some newcomer in a few\r\nmonths, and Isobel go with them--if she hasn't gone already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your views are always uncompromising, Sally.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only wish you'd heard those two women this afternoon. And, in the\r\nend, off they all three went together in the motor-car. Going to pick up\r\nHarry somewhere!\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather too much of a good thing for most men. And it might have been\r\nVivien!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a woman, and one of God's creatures, anyhow,\" said Sally with some\r\ntemper.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" the Nun agreed serenely. \"And Mrs. Freere's a woman--and so, I\r\npresume from your description, is Lady Lucy. And I gather that they have\r\nhusbands? God's creatures too, we may suppose!\"\r\n\r\nSally declined the implied challenge to weigh, in the scales of an\r\nimpartial judgment, the iniquities of the two sexes. Her sympathies,\r\nborn on the night when she had given shelter to Isobel at the Lion, were\r\nwith the woman who was fighting for her husband, who had a plain right\r\nto him now, though she had used questionable means to get him. If Doris\r\nasked her to discern a Nemesis in Isobel's plight--as Belfield had in\r\nthe fall of his too well admired son--to see Vivien avenged by Mrs.\r\nFreere and Lady Lucy, Sally retorted on the philosophic counsel by\r\ndeclaring that Doris, a partisan of Vivien's, lacked human pity for\r\nVivien's successful rival, whose real success seemed now so dubious.\r\n\r\nWhatever the relative merit of these views, and whatever the truth as to\r\nthe wider question of the iniquities of the sexes, Sally's encounter at\r\nleast provided for her friend's contemplation an excellent little\r\npicture of the man whose name had been so bandied about among the three\r\nwomen at the tea-table. Her dislike of Isobel enabled the Nun to\r\ncontemplate it rather with a scornful amusement than with the hot\r\nindignation with which she had lashed Vivien's treacherous lover. Her\r\nfeelings not being engaged in this case, she was able to regain her\r\nfavourite attitude of a tolerant, yet open-eyed, onlooker, and to ask\r\nwhat, after all, was the use of expecting anything else from Harry\r\nBelfield. What Mrs. Freere--nay, what prehistoric Rosa Hinde--had found\r\nout, what Vivien had found out, what Isobel was finding out, that, in\r\ndue time, Lady Lucy would find out also. Perhaps some women did not much\r\nmind finding out. Vivien had renounced him utterly, but here was Mrs.\r\nFreere back again! And no doubt Lady Lucy had her own ideas about Mrs.\r\nFreere--besides the knowledge, shared by the world in general, of the\r\nbrief engagement to Vivien and the hurried marriage with Isobel. Some of\r\nthem did not mind, or at least thought that the game was worth the\r\ncandle. That was the only possible conclusion. In some cases, perhaps,\r\nthey were the same sort of people themselves; in others, Harry's appeal\r\nwas too potent to be resisted, even though they knew that sorrow would\r\nbe the ultimate issue.\r\n\r\nThat was intelligible enough. For the moment, to the woman of the\r\nmoment, his charm was well-nigh irresistible. His power to conquer lay\r\nin the completeness with which he was conquered. He had the name of\r\nbeing a great flirt; in the exact sense of words, he did not flirt save\r\nas a mere introduction of the subject; he always made love--to the woman\r\nof the moment. He did not pay attentions; he was swept into a\r\npassion--for the woman of the moment. It was afterwards, when that\r\nparticular moment and that particular woman had gone by, that Harry's\r\nfeelings passed a retrospective Act by which the love-making and passion\r\nbecame, and were to be deemed always to have been, flirtation and\r\nattention. Amply accepting this legislation for himself, and quite\r\nconvinced of its justice, he seemed to have power to impose it--for the\r\nmoment--on others also. And he would go on like that indefinitely? There\r\nseemed no particular reason why he should stop. He would go on loving\r\nfor a while, being loved for a while; deserting and being despaired of;\r\nsometimes, perhaps, coming back and beginning the process over again;\r\nliving the life of the emotions so long as it would last, making it\r\nlast, perhaps, longer than it ought or really could, because he had no\r\nother life adequate to fill its place. The Nun's remorseless fancy\r\nskipped the years, and pictured him, Harry the Irresistible, Harry the\r\nIncorrigible, still pursuing the old round, still on his way from the\r\nwoman of the last moment to the woman of the next; getting perhaps\r\nrather gray, rather fat, a trifle inclined to coarseness, but preserving\r\nall his ardour and all his art in wooing, like a great singer grown old,\r\nwhose voice is feeble and spent, but whose skill is still triumphant\r\nover his audiences--still convinced that each affair was \"bigger\" than\r\nany of the others, still persuading his partner of the same thing, still\r\nsuffering pangs of pity for himself when he fell away, still responding\r\nto the stimulus of a new pursuit.\r\n\r\nA few days later chance threw him in her way; in truth it could scarcely\r\nbe called chance, since both, returned from their wanderings, had\r\nresumed their habit of frequenting that famous restaurant, and had been\r\nreceived with enthusiasm by the presiding officials. Waiting for her\r\nparty in the outer room, suddenly she found him standing beside her,\r\nlooking very handsome and gay, with a mischievous sparkle in his eye.\r\n\r\n\"May I speak to you--or am I no better than one of the wicked?\" he said,\r\nsitting down beside her.\r\n\r\n\"You're looking very well, Harry. I hope Mrs. Belfield is all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, Isobel's first-rate, thank you. So am I. How London agrees with\r\na man! I was out of sorts half the time down at Meriton. A country life\r\ndoesn't agree with me. I shall chuck it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seemed very well down there--physically,\" the Nun observed.\r\n\r\n\"Sleepy, wasn't it? Sleepy beyond anything. Now here a man feels alive,\r\nand awake!\"\r\n\r\nIt was not in the least what he had thought about Meriton, it was what\r\nhe was feeling about Meriton now. He had passed a retrospective Act\r\nabout Meriton; it was to be deemed to have been always sleepy and dull.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he pursued, \"when I come into Halton--I hope it won't be for a\r\nlong while--I think I shall sell it. I can't settle down as a country\r\nsquire. It's not my line. Too stodgy!\"\r\n\r\n\"What about Parliament? Going to find another place?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I do, it'll be a town constituency. When I think of those beastly\r\nvillages! Really couldn't go through with it again! The fact is, I'm\r\nrather doubtful about the whole of that game, Doris. No end of a\r\ngrind--and what do you get out of it? More kicks than ha'pence, as a\r\nrule. Your own side doesn't thank you, and the other abuses you like a\r\npickpocket.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. \"I think you're quite right. Let it alone.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to her quite eagerly. \"Do you really think so? Well, I'm more\r\nthan half inclined to believe you're right. Isobel's always worrying me\r\nabout it--talks about letting chances slip away, and time slip away, and\r\nI don't know what the devil else slip away--till, hang it, my only\r\ndesire is to imitate time and chances, and slip away myself!\" He laughed\r\nmerrily.\r\n\r\nThe old charm was still there, the power to make his companion take his\r\npoint of view and sympathise with him, even when the merits were all\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n\"You see now what it is to give a woman the right to lecture you,\r\nHarry!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's kind of her to be ambitious for me,\" said Harry\r\ngood-naturedly. \"I quite appreciate that. But--\" His eyes twinkled\r\nagain, and his voice fell to a confidential whisper. \"Well, you've been\r\nbehind the scenes, haven't you? My last shot in that direction has put\r\nme a bit off.\"\r\n\r\nIt was his first reference to the catastrophe; she was curious to see\r\nwhether he would develop it. This Harry proceeded to do.\r\n\r\n\"You were precious hard on me about that business, Doris,\" he said in a\r\ngentle reproach. \"Of course I don't justify what happened. But my dear\r\nold pater and Wellgood pressed matters a bit too quick--oh, not Vivien,\r\nI don't mean that for a moment. There's such a thing as making the game\r\ntoo easy for a fellow. I didn't see it at the time, but I see it now.\r\nThey had their plan. Well, I fell in with it too readily. It looked\r\npleasant enough. The result was that I mistook the strength of my\r\nfeelings. That was the beginning of all the trouble.\"\r\n\r\nVastly amused, the Nun nodded gravely. \"I ought to have thought of that\r\nbefore I was so down on you.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her in a merry suspicion. \"I'm not sure you're not pulling\r\nmy leg, Doris; but all the same that's the truth about it. And at any\r\nrate I suppose you'll admit I did the right thing when--when the trouble\r\ncame?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you did the right thing then.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you admit that much! I say--I suppose you--you haven't heard\r\nanything of Vivien Wellgood?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hear she's in excellent health and spirits.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've never been so cut up about anything. Still, of course, she was a\r\nmere girl, and--well, things pass!\"\r\n\r\n\"Luckily things pass. I've no doubt she'll soon console herself.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll be a very lucky fellow,\" said Harry handsomely. After all, he\r\nhimself had admired Vivien, and his taste was good.\r\n\r\n\"He will. In fact I think I know only one man good enough for her--and\r\nthat's Andy Hayes.\"\r\n\r\nHarry's face was suddenly transformed to a peevish amazement.\r\n\r\n\"My dear girl, are you out of your mind? Don't say such silly things!\r\nOld Andy's a good chap, but the idea that Vivien would look at him! He's\r\nnot her class; and she's the most fastidious little creature alive--as\r\ndainty and fastidious as can be!\" He smiled again--probably at some\r\nreminiscence.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why her being fastidious should prevent her liking Andy.\"\r\n\r\nHarry broke into open impatience. \"I like old Andy--well, I think I've\r\ndone something to prove that--but, upon my soul, you all seem to have\r\ngone mad about him. You all ram him down a man's throat. It's possible\r\nto have too much of him, good fellow as he is. He and Vivien Wellgood!\r\nWell, it's simply damned ridiculous!\" He took out his watch and, as he\r\nlooked at it, exclaimed with great irritation, \"Why the devil doesn't\r\nthis woman come?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought Mrs. Belfield was always so punctual?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not Mrs. Belfield,\" Harry snapped out.\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't be disagreeable to the poor woman simply because I said\r\nsomething you didn't like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something I didn't like? That's an absurd way of putting it. It's only\r\nthat to be for ever hearing of nobody but--\"\r\n\r\n\"That tall young woman over there seems to be staring rather hard at you\r\nand me, Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"By gad, it is her! I must run.\" His smiles broke out again. \"I say,\r\nDoris, I shall get into trouble over this! You're looking your best, my\r\ndear, and she's as jealous as--I must run! Au revoir!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not Mrs. Freere--so I suppose it's Lady Lucy,\" thought the Nun.\r\nShe was in high good temper at the result of her casual allusion to Andy\r\nHayes. The shoe pinched there, did it? She was not vicious towards\r\nHarry; she wished him no harm--indeed she wished him more good than he\r\nwould be likely to welcome--but the extreme complacency of his manner in\r\nthe earlier part of their talk stirred her resentment. Her suggestion\r\nabout Andy Hayes put a quick end to that.\r\n\r\nLady Lucy had an impudent little face, with an impudent little turned-up\r\nnose. She settled herself cosily into her chair on the balcony and\r\npeeled off her gloves.\r\n\r\n\"I'm so glad we're just by ourselves--I mean, since poor Mrs. Belfield\r\nwasn't well enough to come. I was afraid of finding Lily Freere!\"\r\n\r\n\"What made you afraid of that?\" asked Harry, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Well, she is about with you a good deal, isn't she? Does your wife like\r\nbeing managed so much? Or is it your choice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Freere's an old friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I've always understood!\"\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't listen to ill-natured gossip. Just an old friend! But it's\r\nnot very likely I should have asked her to come to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun and her party entered, and sat down at the other end of the\r\nbalcony.\r\n\r\n\"There's that girl you were talking to. Look round; she's sitting facing\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, Doris Flower!\"\r\n\r\n\"An old friend too? You seemed to be having a very confidential\r\nconversation at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the most strictly unsentimental footing. Really there you may\r\nbelieve me!\" Harry's voice fell to an artistic whisper. \"Did you come\r\nonly to tease me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think you care much whether I tease you or not,\" said Lady\r\nLucy.\r\n\r\nHe was helping her to wine; he held the bottle, she held the glass.\r\nSomehow it chanced that their hands touched. Lady Lucy blushed a little\r\nand glanced at Harry. \"How shall I persuade you that I care?\" asked\r\nHarry.\r\n\r\nThe Nun's host--at the other end of the balcony--turned to her. \"You're\r\nnot very talkative to-day, Miss Doris!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry: There's always so much to look at at the other tables,\r\nisn't there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty much the same old lot!\" remarked the host--an experienced youth.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty much!\" agreed the Nun serenely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST FIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a fine Sunday evening in the following autumn Belfield and Andy Hayes\r\nsat over their wine, the ladies having, as usual, adjourned to the\r\ngarden. Among their number were included the Nun and Sally Dutton; a\r\nsecond stay at Meriton had broken down Sally's shyness. Belfield and his\r\nwife were just back from London, whither they had gone to see their\r\ngrandchild, Harry's first-born son. All had gone well, and Belfield was\r\nfull of impressions of his visit. His natural pleasure in the birth of\r\nthe child was damped by Harry's refusal to promise to take up his\r\nresidence at Halton when his turn came.\r\n\r\n\"But I did get him to promise not to sell--only to let; so his son may\r\nlive here, though mine won't.\" He looked older and more frail; his mind\r\nmoved in a near future which, near as it was, he would not see.\r\n\r\n\"I sometimes think,\" he went on, \"that the professional moralists, all\r\nor most of our preachers of one sort and another--and who doesn't preach\r\nnowadays?--take too narrow a view. Their table of virtues isn't\r\ncomprehensive enough. Now my boy Harry, with all his faults, is never\r\ndisagreeable. What an enormous virtue! Negative, if you like, but\r\nenormous! What a lot of pain and discomfort he doesn't give! All through\r\nthis domestic business his behaviour has been admirable--so kind, so\r\nattentive, so genuinely concerned, so properly gratified. Upon my word,\r\nseeing him in his own home, you'd think he was a model! That's a good\r\ndeal. His weakness comes in to save him there; he must be popular--even\r\nin his own house!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, this event'll do them no end of good, sir,\" said Andy, ever ready\r\nto clutch again at the elusive skirts of optimism.\r\n\r\n\"Some, no doubt,\" Belfield cautiously agreed. \"And she's a brave\r\nwoman--I'll say that for her. She understands him, and she loves him.\r\nWhen I saw her, we had a reconciliation on that basis. We let the past\r\nalone--I wasn't anxious to meet her on that ground--and made up our\r\nminds to the future. Her work is to keep things going, to prevent a\r\nsmash. She must shut her eyes sometimes--pretty often, I'm afraid. He'll\r\nalways be very pleasant to her, if she'll do that. In fact, the worse\r\nhe's behaving the pleasanter the rogue will be. I know him of old in\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has he any plans?\" asked Andy.\r\n\r\nBelfield smiled. \"Oh yes. He's got a plan for wintering in Algeria;\r\nthey'll go as soon as she's well enough, stopping in Paris _en route_.\r\nYes, he's really full of plans--for enjoying himself and meeting friends\r\nhe likes. There's a Lady Lucy Somebody who's got the finest motor-car on\r\nearth. She's going to be in Paris. Oh, well, there it is! Plans of any\r\nother sort are dropped. He's dropped them; she's had to drop them--after\r\na good deal of fighting, so she told me. He makes no definite refusals;\r\nhe puts her off, laughs it off, shunts it, you know, and goes on his own\r\nway. One didn't understand how strong that had grown in him--the dislike\r\nof any responsibilities or limits. Being answerable to anybody seems to\r\nvex him. I think he even resents our great expectations, though we go\r\nout of our way to let him see that we've honestly abandoned them! A\r\npleasant drifting over summer seas, with agreeable company, and plenty\r\nof variety in it! That's the programme. We shall probably be wise to add\r\na few storms and a good many minor squalls to get a true idea of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't seem to lead to much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the mistake's ours! For many men I say nothing against the life.\r\nI'm not one of the preachers, and there's something to be said for it\r\nfor some people. We made our own idol, Andy; it's our fault. We saw the\r\ncapacities, we didn't appreciate the weakness. I can't be hard on poor\r\nold Harry, can you? We parted capital friends, I'm glad to say--though\r\nhe was distinctly in a hurry to keep an appointment at a tea-shop.\r\nSomebody passing through London, he said--and through his fancy too, I\r\nimagine.\" He looked across at Andy. \"I suppose it all seems uncommon\r\nqueer to you, Andy?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a bit of a waste, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"So we think, we at Meriton. That's our old idea, and we shan't get over\r\nit. Yes, a bit of a waste! But it's nature's way, I suppose. A fine\r\nfabric with one unsound patch! It does seem a waste, but she's lavish;\r\nand the fabric may be very pleasing to the eye all the same, and serve\r\nall right--so long as you don't strain it!\"\r\n\r\nIn the garden Mrs. Belfield discoursed placidly to Miss Doris Flower; it\r\nwas perhaps fortunate that the veil of night rendered that young lady's\r\nface hard to read.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear, we must let bygones be bygones. I took a very strong\r\nview, a stronger view than I generally take, of her conduct down\r\nhere--though I can't acquit Mr. Wellgood of a large part of the blame.\r\nBut now she's trying to be a good wife to him, I'm sure she is. So I\r\nmade up my mind to forgive her; it's a very fine boy, and like my\r\nfamily, I think. As for the politics and all that, I'm sure Harry is\r\nright, and his father is wrong to regret his withdrawal. Harry is not\r\nfit for that rough work; both his mind and his feelings are too fine and\r\nsensitive. I hope he will be firm and keep out of it all. Mr. Hayes is\r\nmuch more fit for it, much coarser in fibre, you know, dear Miss Flower;\r\nand though, of course, we can't expect from him what we did from\r\nHarry--if only his health had stood it--Mr. Wigram tells me he is doing\r\nreally very well. The common people like him, I understand. Oh, not in\r\nthe way they thought of Harry! That was admiration, almost worship, my\r\ndear. But they think he understands them, and naturally they feel on\r\neasy terms with him. His stepmother was an excellent woman, and I'm sure\r\nwe all respect Mr. Rock. Of course in my young days he'd never have done\r\nfor a county member; but we must move with the times, and I'm really\r\nglad that he's got this chance.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun listened to the kindly patronizing old dame in respectful\r\nsilence. It was really a good thing that she could look at the matter\r\nlike that--evidently aided by the fine boy and the fine boy's likeness\r\nto her family. It was hard to grudge Harry his last worshipper; yet Miss\r\nFlower's smile had not been very sympathetic under the veil of night.\r\n\r\n\"Of course there's poor Vivien--such a sweet girl, and so nice to us!\r\nShe's never let it make any difference as far as we're concerned. I am\r\nsorry for her, and her father's very wrong in keeping her all alone\r\nthere at Nutley to brood over it. He ought to have given her a season in\r\nLondon or taken her abroad--somewhere where she could forget about it,\r\nand have her chance. What chance has she of forgetting Harry here at\r\nMeriton?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can never tell about that, can you, Mrs. Belfield? These things\r\nhappen so oddly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but, my dear, the poor child never sees anybody! Now you see quite\r\na number of young men, I daresay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, quite a number, Mrs. Belfield,\" the Nun admitted demurely.\r\n\r\n\"She sees absolutely nobody, except Mr. Hayes and Mr. Gilly Foot. I\r\ndon't think she's very likely to be taken with Mr. Gilly Foot! Oh no, my\r\ndear, it's a sad case.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought to talk to Mr. Wellgood about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never talk to Mr. Wellgood at all now, my dear, if I can help it. I\r\ndon't like him, and I think his attitude has been very hard--quite\r\nunlike dear Vivien's own! Well, Harry did no more than hint at it, and\r\nIsobel, of course, said nothing; but we may have our own opinions as to\r\nwhether it's all for Vivien's sake!\" Mrs. Belfield almost achieved\r\nviciousness in this remark. \"And--it may seem selfish of me to say\r\nit--if she married and went away, Harry might be more inclined to come\r\ndown here. As it is, he feels it would be awkward. He's so sensitive!\"\r\n\r\nBelfield and Andy came out--the old man muffled in shawls and, even so,\r\nfearing his wife's rebuke, Andy drawing the fresh air eagerly into his\r\nlungs. He had dined for the first time since the Sunday before; the\r\nmiles he had covered, the speeches he had made, defied calculation. He\r\nhad hardly any voice left. His work was nearly done; the polling was on\r\nthe morrow. But he was due in a neighbouring constituency the day after\r\nthat--for one more week. Then back to Gilbert Foot and Co., to make up\r\narrears. Surveying the work he had done and was about to do, he rejoiced\r\nin his strength, as formerly he had rejoiced to follow Lord Meriton's\r\nhounds on his legs and to anticipate the fox's wiles.\r\n\r\nHe sat down by Mrs. Belfield. Vivien and Sally, who had been strolling,\r\njoined the group, of which he made the centre.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it looks all right,\" he said, continuing his talk with Belfield.\r\n\"Wigram promises me a thousand. A strong candidate would get that. I\r\nhope for about six hundred.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think it's safe, though, anyhow?\" asked Vivien.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think it's safe.\" He broke into a laugh. \"If anybody had told me\r\nthis!\"\r\n\r\nThey discussed the fight in all its aspects, especially the last great\r\nmeeting in the Town Hall the night before. The Nun mimicked Andy's\r\ncroaking notes with much success, and Miss Dutton commented on popular\r\ninstitutions with some severity. They were full of excitement as to the\r\nmorrow, when the three girls meant to follow Andy's progress through the\r\nDivision. Mrs. Belfield gave tokens of an inclination to doze. Belfield\r\nsat listening to the girls' voices, to their eager excited talk, and\r\ntheir constant appeals to the hero of the day.\r\n\r\nThe hero of the day! It was Andy Hayes, son of old Mr. Hayes of the\r\nGrammar School, _protege_, for his stepmother's sake, of Jack Rock the\r\nbutcher. He had nearly gone back abroad in failure; he had nearly taken\r\non the shop. He stood now the winner in the fight, triumphant in a\r\ncontest which he had never sought, from the idea of which he would have\r\nshrunk as from rank folly and rank treason. Into that fight he had been\r\ndrawn unconsciously, insensibly, irresistibly, by another man's doings\r\nand by his own, by another man's character and by the character that was\r\nhis. His conscious part had always been to help his adversary; his\r\nadversary unconsciously worked all the while for him. What his adversary\r\nhad bestowed in ready kindness stood as nothing beside what he had given\r\nunwittingly, by accident, never thinking that the results of what he did\r\nwould transcend the limits of his own fortunes, and powerfully mould and\r\nshape another's life. Whom Andy loved he had conquered; whom he followed\r\nhe had supplanted. The cheers and applause which had rung out for him\r\nlast night had, a short year ago, been the property of another. His\r\nplace was his by conquest.\r\n\r\nSo mused Belfield, father of the vanquished, as he sat silent while the\r\nmerry voices sounded in his ears. A notable example of how each man\r\nfinds his place, in spite of all the starts, or weights, or handicaps\r\nwith which he enters on the race! These things tell, but not enough to\r\nland an unsound horse at the post before a sound one. The unsound\r\nfalters; slowly and surely the sound lessens the gap between them. At\r\nlast he takes the lead. Then the cry of the crowd is changed, and he\r\ngallops on to victory amidst its plaudits. Jack Rock had made no mistake\r\nwhen he entered his horse and put up the stakes.\r\n\r\nThe hero of that day, the victor in that fight, yes! Against his wishes,\r\nwithout premeditation, so he stood. There was another day of strife,\r\nanother fight to be waged, one that could not be unmeant or unconscious.\r\nHere the antagonism must come into the open, must be revealed to the\r\nmind and heart of the fighter. Here he must not only follow, he must\r\nhimself drive out; he must not only supplant, he must strive to banish,\r\nnay, to annihilate. There was a last citadel which, faithful to\r\nfaithlessness and true against desertion, still flew the flag of that\r\nloved antagonist. Would the flag dip and the gates open at his summons?\r\nOr would the response to his parley be that, though the faithless might\r\nbe faithless, yet the faithful must be faithful still? Before that\r\nanswer his arm would be paralyzed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm sure you'll deserve your success, Mr. Hayes,\" said Mrs.\r\nBelfield, rising and preparing to retreat indoors. \"I hear you've worked\r\nvery hard and made an extremely good impression.\"\r\n\r\nA quiet smile ran round the circle. The speech, with its delicate, yet\r\nserenely sure, patronage would have sounded so natural a year before. In\r\nthe darkness Andy found himself smiling too. A sense of strength stirred\r\nin him. The day for encouragement was past; he did not need it. Save for\r\nthat last citadel! There still he feared and shrank. With his plain\r\nmind, in his strenuous days, he had done little idealising. Only two\r\npeople had he ever treated in that flattering exacting fashion. His\r\nidealising stood in his path now. The weak spot of his sturdy\r\ncommon-sense had always been about Harry; it was so still, and he had an\r\nobstinate sense of trying to kick his old idol, now that it was\r\noverthrown. And for her--how if his approach seemed a rude intrusion,\r\nthe invasion of a desolate yet still holy spot, sacrilege committed on a\r\nruined shrine? On the one side was Harry, or the memory of Harry,\r\nstronger perhaps than Harry himself. On the other he himself stood,\r\nacutely conscious of his associations for her, remembering ever the\r\nbutcher's shop, recollecting that what favour he had won had been in the\r\ncapacity of a buffer against the attack of others. How if the buffer,\r\nforsaking its protective function, encroached on its own account?\r\n\r\nYet in the course of the months past they had grown into so close a\r\nfriendship, so firm an alliance. On his part there had been no wooing,\r\non hers neither coquetry nor sentiment displayed. To Harry Belfield\r\ntheir relations to each other would have appeared extremely dull,\r\nunpermissibly stagnant, reflecting no credit on the dash of the man or\r\nthe sensibility of the lady. Sally Dutton, suspecting Andy's hopes, had\r\na caustic word of praise for his patience--the sort of remark which,\r\nrepeated to Harry about himself, would have sent him straight off to a\r\ndeclaration (the like had happened once by the lake at Nutley). But\r\nthrough these long days, as Andy came and went on his twofold work, from\r\nDivision to business, from business to Division, they had become\r\nwonderfully necessary to one another. For her not to expect him, for him\r\nnot to find her, would have taken as it were half the heart out of life.\r\nWho else was there? Vivien had drawn a little nearer to that dour father\r\nof hers, but nearness to him carried the command for self-repression,\r\nfor reticence. Andy seemed to have no other with whom to talk of himself\r\nand his life, as even the strongest feel a craving to talk sometimes.\r\nPerhaps there was one other ready to serve. He did not know it; she\r\nranked for him among the cherished friends of his lighter hours. He\r\ncraved an intimate companionship for the deeper moments, and seemed to\r\nfind it only in one place.\r\n\r\nAt his own game, his speciality, Harry Belfield could give away all the\r\nodds, and still be a formidable opponent. The incomparable love-maker\r\ncould almost overcome his own treasons; he left such a memory, such a\r\npattern. Isobel loved still; Mrs. Freere was ready to come back; Lady\r\nLucy owned to herself that she was in danger of being very silly. Even\r\nthe Nun was in the habit of congratulating herself on a certain escape,\r\nwith the implication that the escape was an achievement. To resist him\r\nan achievement! To forget him--what could that be? To Andy it seemed\r\nthat for any woman it must be an impossibility. In the veiled distance\r\nof Vivien's eyes, when the talk veered towards her unfaithful lover, he\r\ncould find no dissent. Was oblivion a necessity? Here he was--in Harry's\r\nplace. Did he forget?\r\n\r\nThey let him rest--with his thoughts; they saw that the big fellow was\r\nweary. The old Belfields conducted one another into the house; Vivien\r\ntook Sally off again with her. Only Doris Flower sat on by him, silent\r\ntoo, revolving in her mind the chronicles of Meriton, the little town\r\nwith which her whim had brought her into such close touch, from which\r\nshe was not now minded wholly to separate herself. It seemed like an\r\nanchorage in the wandering sea of her life. It offered some things very\r\ngood--a few firm friends, a sense of home, a place where she was Doris\r\nFlower, not merely the Nun, the Quaker, or Joan of Arc. Did she wish\r\nthat it offered yet more? Ah, there she paused! She was a worker born,\r\nas Andy himself was. No work for her lay in Meriton. Perhaps she desired\r\nincompatibles, like many of us; being clear-eyed, she saw the\r\nincompatibility. And she was not subjected to temptation. She was taken\r\nat the valuation which she so carefully put on herself--the good comrade\r\nof the lighter hours. No cause of complaint then? None! She did not cry,\r\nshe did not fall in love. She did not break her records. There is small\r\nmerit in records unless they are hard to make, and sometimes hard to\r\nkeep.\r\n\r\nShe stretched out her hand and laid it on his arm. He turned to her with\r\na start, roused from his weariness and his reverie.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Andy, have you learnt what we have, I wonder? Not yet, I expect!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Doris?\"\r\n\r\n\"Trust in you. A certainty that you'll bring it off!\" She laughed--a\r\nlittle nervously. \"I've a professional eye for a situation. Try for a\r\ndouble victory to-morrow! Make a really fine day for yourself--one to\r\nremember always!\" She drew her hand away with another nervous laugh; her\r\nclear soft voice had trembled.\r\n\r\nAndy's inward feelings leapt to utterance. \"Have you any notion of what\r\nI feel? I--I'm up against him in everything! It's almost uncanny. And I\r\nthink he'll beat me in this. At least I suppose you mean--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I mean that.\" Her voice was calm again, a little mocking. \"But I\r\nshall say no more about it.\"\r\n\r\nAndy pressed her hand. \"I like to have your good wishes more than\r\nanybody's in the world,\" he said, \"unless, perhaps, it were his, Doris.\r\nDon't say I told you, but he grudges me the seat. He'd grudge me the\r\nother thing worse, much worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but that's quite morbid. It's all his own fault.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I suppose so. But he's never been to you what he has to me.\" He\r\nsmiled. \"We at Meriton still have to please Harry, and to have him\r\npleased with us. The old habit's very strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heavens, Andy, you wouldn't think of sacrificing yourself--and perhaps\r\nher--to an idea like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, that would be foolish, and wrong--as you say, morbid. But it can't\r\nbe--whatever she says to me--it can't be as if he had never existed--as\r\nif it all hadn't happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some people feel things too little, some feel them too much,\" the Nun\r\nobserved. \"Both bad habits!\"\r\n\r\n\"I daresay the thing's a bit more than usual on my mind\r\nto-night--because of to-morrow, you know.\" He was silent for a moment;\r\nthen he broke into one of his simple hearty laughs. \"And I am such an\r\nawful duffer at making love!\"\r\n\r\n\"You certainly have no great natural talent for it and, as you've told\r\nme, very little practice. Oh, I wonder how big your majority will be,\r\nAndy!\"\r\n\r\nAndy readily turned back to the election. Yet even here the attitude she\r\nhad reproved in him seemed to persist. \"I expect, as I said, about six\r\nhundred. Harry would have got a thousand easily.\"\r\n\r\nAndy escorted Vivien back to Nutley. He had it in mind to speak his\r\nheart--at least to sound her feeling for him; but she forestalled his\r\nopening.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Belfield's been talking to me about Harry to-night, for the first\r\ntime. He wrote me a letter once, but he has never spoken of him before.\r\nHe was rather pathetic. Oh, Andy, why can't people think what they are\r\ndoing to other people? And poor Isobel--I'm afraid she won't be happy. I\r\nused to feel very hard about her. I can't any more, now that the little\r\nchild has come. That seems to make it all right somehow, whatever has\r\nhappened before. At any rate she's got the best right now, hasn't she?\"\r\nShe was silent a moment. \"It was like this that I came home with him\r\nthat last evening. He was so gay and so kind. Then--in a flash--it\r\nhappened!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been thinking about him too to-night. It seemed natural to do\r\nit--over this election.\"\r\n\r\nThey had reached Nutley, but Andy pleaded for a walk on the terrace by\r\nthe lake before she bade him good-night.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"I know what you must feel, because you loved him. I\r\nloved him, and I feel it too. But we must neither of us think about it\r\ntoo much. Because it's no use. What Mr. Belfield told me makes it quite\r\nclear that it's no use.\" She spoke very sadly. They had not to do with\r\nan accident or an episode; they had to recognise and reckon with the\r\nnature of a man. \"When once we see that it's no use, it seems to me that\r\nthere's something--well, almost something unworthy in giving way to it.\"\r\nShe turned round to Andy. \"At least I don't want you to go on doing it.\r\nYou've made your own success. Take it whole-heartedly, Andy; don't have\r\nany regrets, any searchings of heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"There may be other things besides the seat at Meriton that I should\r\nlike to take. When I search my heart, Vivien, I find you there.\"\r\n\r\nThrough the darkness he saw her eyes steadily fixed on his.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder, Andy, I wonder! Or is it only pity, only chivalry? Is it the\r\npoliceman again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why shouldn't it be the policeman?\" he asked. \"Is it nothing if you\r\nthink you could feel safe with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"So much, so much!\" she murmured. \"Andy, I'm still angry when I\r\nremember--still sore--and angry again with myself for being sore. I\r\noughtn't still to feel that.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd guessed my feelings, Vivien? You're not surprised or--or\r\nshocked?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I've known everything that has been in your heart--both about\r\nhim and about me. No, I'm not surprised or shocked. But--I wonder!\" She\r\nlaughed sadly. \"How perverse our hearts are--poor Harry's, and poor\r\nmine! And how unlucky we two should have hit on one another! That for\r\nhim it should be so easy, and for me so sadly difficult!\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't ask you my question to-night,\" said Andy.\r\n\r\n\"No, don't to-night.\" She laid her hand on his arm. \"But you won't go\r\naway altogether, will you, Andy? You won't be sensible and firm, and\r\ntell me that you can't be at my beck and call, and that you won't be\r\nkept dangling about, and that if I'm a silly girl who doesn't know her\r\nown luck I must take the consequences? You'll go on being the old Andy\r\nwe all know, who never makes any claims, who puts up with everybody's\r\nwhims, who always expects to come last?\" Her voice trembled as she\r\nlaughed. \"You won't upset all my notions of you, because you've become a\r\ngreat man now, will you, Andy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't quite recognise myself in the picture,\" said Andy with a laugh.\r\n\"I thought I generally stood up for myself pretty well. But, anyhow,\r\nI've no intention of going away. I shall be there when--I mean if--you\r\nwant me.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave him her hand; he gripped it warmly. \"You're--you're not very\r\ndisappointed, Andy? Oh, I hate to cloud your day of triumph to-morrow!\"\r\nHer voice rose a little, a note almost of despair in it. \"But I can't\r\nhelp it! The old thing isn't gone yet, and, till it is, I can do\r\nnothing.\"\r\n\r\nAndy raised the hand he held to his lips and kissed it lightly. \"I see\r\nthat I'm asking for an even bigger thing than I thought,\" he said\r\ngently. \"Don't worry, and don't hurry, my dear. I can wait. Perhaps it's\r\ntoo big for me to get at all. You'll tell me about that at your own\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nThey began to walk back towards the house, and presently came under the\r\nlight of the lamp over the hall door. Her face now wore a troubled\r\nsmile, amused yet sad. How obstinate that memory was! It was here that\r\nHarry had given her his last kiss--here that, only a few minutes later,\r\nshe had seen him for the last time, and Isobel Vintry with him! Their\r\nphantoms rose before her eyes--and the angry shape of her father was\r\nthere too, denouncing their crime, pronouncing by the same words\r\nsentence of death on the young happiness of her heart.\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, Andy,\" she said softly. \"And a great triumph to-morrow.\r\nOver a thousand!\"\r\n\r\nA great triumph to-morrow, maybe. There was no great triumph to-night,\r\nonly a long hard-fought battle--the last fight in that strangely-fated\r\nantagonism. Verily the enemy was on his own ground here. With everything\r\nagainst him, he was still dangerous, he was not yet put to the rout. The\r\nflag of the citadel was not yet dipped, the gates not opened, allegiance\r\nnot transferred.\r\n\r\nAndy Hayes squared his shoulders for this last fight--with good courage\r\nand with a single mind. The revelation she had made of her heart moved\r\nhim to the battle. It was a great love which Harry had so lightly taken\r\nand so lightly flung away. It was worth a long and a great struggle. And\r\nhe could now enter on it with no searchings of his own heart. As he\r\nmused over her words, the appeal of memory--of old loyalty and\r\nfriendship grew fainter. Harry had won all that, and thrown all that\r\naway--had been so insensible to what it really was, to what it meant,\r\nand what it offered. New and cogent proof indeed that he was \"no good.\"\r\nThe depths of Vivien's love made mean the shallows of his nature. He\r\nmust go his ways; Andy would go his--from to-morrow. With sorrow, but\r\nnow with clear conviction, he turned away from his broken idol. From the\r\nlips of the girl who could not forget his love had come Harry's final\r\ncondemnation. The spell was broken for Andy Hayes; he was resolute that\r\nhe would break it from the heart of Vivien. Loyalty should no more be\r\nfor the disloyal, or faith for the faithless. There too Andy would come\r\nby his own--and now with no remorse. At last the spell was broken.\r\n\r\nBut no double victory to-morrow! The loved antagonist retreated slowly,\r\nshowing fight. The next day gave Andy a victory indeed, but did not\r\nyield the situation which the Nun's professional eye had craved for its\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVI.\r\n\r\nTALES OUT OF SCHOOL FOR ONCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inner circle of Andy Hayes' friends, who were gradually accustoming\r\nthemselves to see him described as Mr. Andrew Hayes, M.P., included some\r\nof a sportive, or even malicious, turn of wit. It cannot be denied that\r\nto these the spectacle of Andy's wooing--it never occurred to him to\r\nconceal his suit--presented some material for amusement. All through his\r\ncareer, even after he had mounted to eminences great and imposing, it\r\nwas his fate to bring smiles to the lips even of those who admired,\r\nsupported, and followed him. To the comic papers, in those later days\r\nwhen the Press took account of him, he was always a slow man, almost a\r\nstupid man, inclined to charge a brick wall when he might walk round it,\r\nyet, when he charged, knocking a hole big enough to get through. For the\r\ncartoonists--when greatness bred cartoons, as by one of the world's\r\nkindly counterbalances it does--he was always stouter in body and more\r\nstolid in countenance than a faithful photograph would have recorded\r\nhim. The idea of him thus presented did him no harm in the public mind.\r\nThat a career is open to talent is a fact consolatory only to a\r\nminority; flatter mere common-sense with the same prospect, and every\r\nman feels himself fit for the Bench--of Judges, Bishops, or Ministers.\r\n\r\nBut as a lover--a wooer? Passion, impetuosity, a total absorption, great\r\neloquence in few words, the eyes beating the words in persuasion--such\r\nseemed, roughly, the requisites, as learnt by those who had sat at Harry\r\nBelfield's feet and marked his practical expositions of the subject.\r\nAndy was neither passionate nor eloquent, not even in glances. Nor was\r\nhe absorbed. Gilbert Foot and Co. from nine-thirty to two-thirty: the\r\nHouse from two-thirty to eleven, with what Gilly contemptuously termed\r\n\"stoking\" slipped in anywhere: there was hardly time for real\r\nabsorption. He was as hard-worked as Mr. Freere himself, and, had he\r\nmarried Mrs. Freere, would probably have made little better success of\r\nit. He was not trying to marry Mrs. Freere; but he was trying to win a\r\ngirl who had listened to wonderful words from Harry Belfield's lips and\r\nsuffered the persuasion of Harry Belfield's eyes.\r\n\r\nIn varying fashion his friends made their jesting comments, with\r\naffection always at the back of the joke; nay more, with a confidence\r\nthat the efforts they derided would succeed in face of their\r\nderision--like the comic papers of future days.\r\n\r\n\"He wants to marry, so he must make love; but I believe he hates it all\r\nthe time,\" said the Nun compassionately.\r\n\r\n\"That shows his sense,\" remarked Sally Dutton.\r\n\r\n\"He's a natural monogamist,\" opined Billy Foot, \"and no natural\r\nmonogamist knows anything about making love.\"\r\n\r\n\"He ought to have been born married,\" Gilly yawned, \"just as I ought to\r\nhave been born retired from business.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Billy (_nee_ Amaranth Macquart-Smith) was also of the party. Among\r\nthese sallies she spread the new-fledged wings of her wit rather\r\ntimidly. To say the truth, she was not witty, but felt bound to try--a\r\ncase somewhat parallel to his at whom her shaft was aimed. She was liked\r\nwell enough in the circle, yet would hardly have entered it without\r\nBilly's passport.\r\n\r\n\"He waits to be accepted,\" she complained, \"as a girl waits to be\r\nasked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Used to!\" briefly corrected Miss Dutton.\r\n\r\nBilly Foot cut deeper into the case. \"He's never imagined before that he\r\ncould have a chance against Harry. He's got the idea now, but it takes\r\ntime to sink in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Harry's out of it anyhow,\" drawled Gilly.\r\n\r\n\"Out of what?\" asked the Nun.\r\n\r\nBilly's nod acknowledged the import of the question. Out of reason, out\r\nof possibility, out of bounds! Not out of memory, of echo, of the mirror\r\nof things not to be forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"He still thinks he can't compete with Harry,\" she went on, \"and he's\r\nright as far as this game is concerned. But he'll win just by not\r\ncompeting. To be utterly different is his chance.\" With a glance round\r\nthe table, she appealed to their experience. \"Nobody ever begins by\r\nchoosing Andy--well, except Jack Rock perhaps, and that was to be a\r\nbutcher! But he ends by being indispensable.\"\r\n\r\n\"You all like him,\" said Amaranth. \"And yet you all give the impression\r\nthat he's terribly dull!\" Her voice complained of an enigma.\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't you know, what would a fellow do without him?\" asked Gilly,\r\nlooking up from his _pate_.\r\n\r\n\"Gilly has an enormous respect for him. He's shamed him into working,\"\r\nBilly explained to his wife.\r\n\r\n\"That's it, by Jove!\" Gilly acknowledged sadly. \"And the worst of it is,\r\nwork pays! Pays horribly well! We're getting rich. I've got to go on\r\nwith it.\" He winked a leisurely moving eyelid at the Nun. \"I wish the\r\ndeuce I'd never met the fellow!\"\r\n\r\n\"I must admit he points the moral a bit too well,\" Billy confessed. \"But\r\nI'm glad to say we have Harry to fall back upon. I met Harry in the\r\nstreet the other day, and he was absolutely radiant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is she?\" asked Sally Dutton.\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit, Sally! He's just given up Lady Lucy. Going straight again,\r\ndon't you know? Off to the seaside with his wife and kid.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long has Lady Lucy lasted?\" asked Gilly.\r\n\r\nThe Nun gurgled. \"I should like to have that set to music,\" she\r\nexplained. \"The alliteration is effective, Gilly, and I would give it a\r\npleasing lilt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't wish to hear you sing it,\" said Billy, in a voice none too\r\nloud. Amaranth was looking about the room, and an implied reference to\r\nbygones was harmlessly agreeable.\r\n\r\n\"With his wife and his kid, to the Bedford at Brighton,\" Billy\r\ncontinued, after his aside. \"From something he let fall, I gathered that\r\nthe Freeres were going to be at the Norfolk.\"\r\n\r\nAmaranth did not see the point. \"I don't know the Freeres,\" she\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n\"We do,\" said Gilly. \"In fact we're in the habit of turning them to the\r\nuses of allegory, Amaranth. I may say that we are coming to regard Mrs.\r\nFreere as a comparative reformation--as the irreducible minimum. If only\r\nHarry wouldn't wander from Freere's wife!\"\r\n\r\n\"But the man's got a wife of his own!\" cried Amaranth.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but we're dealing with practical possibilities,\" Gilly insisted.\r\n\"And, from that point of view, his own wife really doesn't count.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet Vivien Wellgood--!\" The Nun relapsed into a silence which was\r\nmeant to express bewilderment, though she was not bewildered, having too\r\nkeen a memory of her own achievement.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you really understand it better than that, Doris,\" said Billy.\r\n\"Harry can make it seem a tremendous thing--while it lasts. Andy's fault\r\nis that he never makes things seem tremendous. He just makes them seem\r\nnatural. His way is safer; it takes longer, but it lasts longer too.\r\nNeither of them is the ideal man, you know. Andy wants an occasional\r\nhour of Harry--\"\r\n\r\n\"Dangerously long!\" the Nun opined.\r\n\r\n\"And Harry ought to have seven years' penal servitude of Andy. Then you\r\nmight achieve the perfectly balanced individual.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you're perfectly balanced, dear,\" said Amaranth, and thereby\r\nthrew her husband into sorest confusion, and the rest of the company\r\ninto uncontrolled mirth. Moreover the Nun must needs add, with her most\r\ninnocent expression, \"Just what I've always found him, Amaranth!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hang it--when I was trying to talk sense!\" poor Billy expostulated.\r\n\r\nHis bride's remark--admirably bridal in character--choked Billy's\r\nphilosophising in its hour of birth. The trend of the conversation was\r\ndiverted, the picture of the perfectly balanced man never painted. Else\r\nthere might have emerged the interesting and agreeable paradox that the\r\nperfectly balanced man was he who knew when to lose his balance, when to\r\nkick the scales away for an hour, when to stop thinking of anybody\r\nexcept himself, when to sink consideration in urgency, pity in desire,\r\naffection in love. All this, of course, only for an hour--and in the\r\nright company. It must be allowed that the perfect balance is a rare\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nIsobel Vintry had not sought it; it is to her credit that she refrained\r\nfrom accusing fate because she had not found what she did not seek.\r\nForgiving Harry over the Lady Lucy episode--his penitence was\r\nirresistibly sincere--and accepting Mrs. Freere as an orderly and\r\nordinary background to married life, almost a friend, certainly an ally\r\n(for Mrs. Freere was now, as ever, a prudent woman), she recalled the\r\ncourage that had made her a fit preceptress for Vivien, and Wellgood's\r\nideal woman. She saw the trick her heart had played her, and knew--with\r\nHarry himself--that hearts would always be playing tricks. The poacher\r\nwas made keeper, but the poaching did not stop. The thief was robbed,\r\nthe raider raided. All a very pretty piece of poetical justice--with the\r\nunusual characteristic of being quite commonplace, an everyday affair,\r\nno matter of melodrama, but just what constantly happens.\r\n\r\nShe and Wellgood had so often agreed that Vivien must be trained to face\r\nthe rubs of life, its ups and downs, its rough and smooth; timidity and\r\nfastidiousness were out of place in a world like this. The two had\r\ntaught the lesson to an unwilling pupil; they themselves had now to\r\naspire to a greater aptitude in learning it. Wellgood conned his lesson\r\nill. The gospel of anti-sentimentality fits other people's woes better\r\nthan a man's own; his seem so real as to defeat the application of the\r\ndoctrine. The first and loudest to proclaim that no man or woman is to\r\nbe trusted, that he who does not suspect invites deception and has\r\nhimself to thank if he is duped--that is the man who nurses bitterest\r\nwrath over the proving of his own theories. Aghast at having yourself\r\nthe honour of proving your own theories! The world does funny things\r\nwith us. To be taken at your word like that; really to find people about\r\nyou as bad as you have declared humanity at large to be; to stumble and\r\nbreak your knees over a justification of your cynicism--it would seem a\r\nthing that should meet with acquiescence, perhaps even with a sombre\r\nsatisfaction. Yet it does not happen so. The optimist fares better; he\r\nfalls from a higher chair but on to a thicker carpet; and he himself is\r\nfar more elastic. \"With what measure you mete, it shall be measured to\r\nyou again.\" Hard measure for hard people seems to fulfil the saying, and\r\nis not a just occasion for grumbling--even for internal grumbling, which\r\nis the hard man's only resource, since he has accustomed sympathy and\r\nconfidence to hide their faces from his ridicule, and their tender hands\r\nto shrink from the grip of his contempt.\r\n\r\nIsobel Belfield possessed just what Isobel Vintry had stolen. Neither\r\nChurch nor State, no, nor the more primitive sanction of the birth of a\r\nson, availed to give a higher validity to her title. In rebuking\r\ninconstancy she was out of court; she was estopped, as the lawyers call\r\nit. How could she refuse to forgive the thing which alone gave her the\r\nright to be aggrieved? Her possession was tainted in its origin. Or was\r\nshe to arrogate to herself the privilege of being the only thief? Harry\r\nBelfield confessed new crimes to an old accomplice; severity would have\r\nmerited a smile. Stolen kisses acknowledged recalled stolen kisses that\r\nhad been a secret. Condemned by the tribunal of the present, Harry's\r\noffences appealed to the past. \"See yourself as Vivien--see her (Lady\r\nLucy, Mrs. Freere, or another) as yourself!\" Harry's deprecatory smile\r\nseemed to threaten some such disarming suggestion. Church and State and\r\nthe little boy might say, \"There's all the difference!\" Neither State\r\nnor Church nor little boy could deafen the echo of Wellgood's\r\ndenunciation or blur the image of Vivien's stricken face. They were a\r\npair of thieves; the court of conscience would not listen to her plea if\r\nshe complained of an unfair division of the plunder. Hands held up in\r\npetition for justice must be clean--an old doctrine of equity; an\r\naccount will not be taken between two highwaymen on Hounslow Heath.\r\n\r\nOrigins are obstinate, leaving marks whatever variations time may bring.\r\nShe had begun as one of two--and not the legitimate one. She was to be\r\none of two always, so it appeared, through all the years until the Nun's\r\npitiless vision worked itself out, and even Harry Belfield ceased to\r\nsuffer new passions--or, at least, to inspire them; perhaps the latter\r\nending of the matter was the more likely.\r\n\r\nHe did nothing else than suffer passions and inspire them; that was the\r\nhardest rub. Where was the brilliant career? Where the great success of\r\nwhich Vivien had been wont to talk shyly? Isobel was a woman of hard\r\nmettle, of high ambition. She could have endured to be official queen,\r\nthough queens unofficial came and went. But there was to be no kingdom!\r\nThere was abdication of all realms save Harry's own. He grew more and\r\nmore contented to specialise there. Irregularity in private conduct is\r\npartially condoned in useful men; as a discreetly hidden diversion, it\r\nis left to another jurisdiction--_deorum injuriae dis curae_--but as the\r\noccupation of a life? The widest stretch of philosophic contemplation of\r\nthe whole is demanded to excuse or to justify.\r\n\r\nHe made a strange thing of her life--a restless, unpeaceful,\r\ninteresting, and unhappy thing. The old idea of reigning at Nutley, of\r\nskilfully managing stubborn Wellgood, of the seeming submission that was\r\nreally rule (perhaps woman's commonest conception of triumph), did not\r\nserve the turn of this life. It was stranger work--living with Harry!\r\nBeing so well treated--and so well deceived! So courted and so flouted!\r\nThe change was violent from the days when Vivien's companion stole\r\nkisses that belonged to her unsuspecting charge. A pretty irony to find\r\nherself on the defensive! A prettier, perhaps, to see her best resource\r\nin an alliance with Mrs. Freere! But it came to that. Never in words, of\r\ncourse--tacitly, in lifted brows and shoulders shrugged. So long as\r\nthere was nobody except Mrs. Freere--so long as there was nobody besides\r\nhis wife--things were not very wrong for the allies. A sense of security\r\nregained, precariously regained--a current of silent but mutual\r\ncongratulations--ran between the Bedford and the Norfolk hotels at\r\nBrighton when Lady Lucy had received her _conge_. Harry's degrees of\r\npenitence and of confession at the two houses of entertainment must\r\nremain uncertain; at both he was no doubt possessed by the determination\r\nto lead a new life; he had been possessed by that when first he heard\r\nthe potent voice calling him to Meriton.\r\n\r\nHarry Belfield--the admired Harry of so many hopes--was in process of\r\nbecoming a joke! It was the worst fate of all; yet what other refuge had\r\nthe despair of his friends? Even to condemn with gravity was difficult;\r\ngravity seemed to accuse its wearer of making too much of the\r\nridiculous--which was to be ridiculous himself. In old days they had\r\nlaughed at Harry's love affairs as at his foible; he seemed all foible\r\nnow--there was nothing else. His life and its possibilities had narrowed\r\nand dwindled down to that. Billy Foot had tried to be serious on the\r\nsubject. What was the use, when there was only one question to be asked\r\nabout him--who was the latest woman? An atmosphere of ridicule, kindly,\r\ntender, infinitely regretful, yet still ridicule, enveloped the figure\r\nof him who once had been a hero. This was a different quality of jest\r\nfrom that which found its occasion in Andy Hayes' patient wooing. Andy\r\ncould afford to be patient; once again his opponent was doing his work\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\nSpring saw the Nun installed in a hired house of her own at Meriton,\r\nSeymour being kept busy conveying her to and fro between her new home\r\nand London, as and when the claims of her profession called her. But\r\nSunday was always marked by a gathering of friends--the Foots if they\r\nwere at Halton, Andy, Vivien Wellgood from Nutley; often Belfield would\r\ndrop in to see the younger folk. Jack Rock had his audiences to himself,\r\nfor he sturdily refused to intrude on his \"betters\"--aye, even though\r\nhis sign was down, though the National, Colonial, and International\r\nPurveyors reigned in his stead, though the Member for the Division\r\noccupied rooms in his house. To Jack life seemed to have done two\r\nwonderful things for him--one was the rise and triumph of Andy; the\r\nother was his friendship with Miss Doris Flower. He was, in fact,\r\nhopelessly in love with that young lady; the Nun was quite aware of it\r\nand returned his affection heartily. Jack delighted to sit with her, to\r\nlook and listen, and sometimes to talk of Andy--of all that he had done,\r\nof all that he was going to do. Jack's hard-working, honest, and, it may\r\nbe added, astute life was crowned by a very gracious evening.\r\n\r\nThe Nun's new home stood in High Street, with a pretty little front\r\ngarden, where she loved to sit and survey the doings of the town, even\r\nas had been her wont from her window at the Lion. Here she was one\r\nmorning, and Jack Rock with her. She lay stretched on a long chair, with\r\nher tiny feet protruding from her white frock, her hair gleaming in the\r\nsun, her eyes looking at Jack with a merry affection.\r\n\r\n\"You do make a picture, miss; you fair do make a picture!\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Don't flirt, Jack,\" said the Nun in grave rebuke. \"You ought to know by\r\nnow that I don't go in for flirtation, and I can't let even you break\r\nthe rules. Though I confess at once that you tempt me very much, because\r\nyou do it so nicely. It's funny, Jack, that both you and I should have\r\nchosen the single life, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\nJack shook his head reproachfully. \"Ah, miss, that's where you're wrong!\r\nI'm not sayin' anythin' against Miss Vivien--she's a sweet young lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"What has Vivien got to do with single lives?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, miss, no offence, I hope? But if it had been so as you'd laid\r\nyourself out--so to speak--for Andy.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun blushed just a little, and laughed just a little also. \"Oh,\r\nthat's your idea, Jack? You are a schemer!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got nothin' to say against Miss Vivien. But I wish it had been\r\nyou, miss,\" Jack persisted.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jack, wouldn't you have been jealous? Do say you'd have been\r\njealous!\"\r\n\r\n\"Keepin' him waitin' too the way she does!\" Jack's voice grew rather\r\nindignant. \"It don't look to me as if she put a proper value on him,\r\nmiss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you're just a little bit partial to Andy?\" the Nun suggested.\r\n\r\n\"And not a proper value on herself either, if she's still hankerin'\r\nafter Mr. Harry. Him as is after half the women in London, if you can\r\ntrust all you hear.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun's face was towards the street, Jack's back towards it. The\r\ngarden gate was open.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" said the Nun softly. \"Here comes Vivien!\"\r\n\r\nPoor old Jack was no diplomatist. He sprang to his feet, red as a turkey\r\ncock, and turned round to find Vivien at his elbow.\r\n\r\n\"I--I beg your pardon, miss,\" he stammered, rushing at the conclusion\r\nthat she had overheard.\r\n\r\nVivien looked at him in amused surprise. \"But what's the matter, Mr.\r\nRock? Why, I believe you must have been talking about me!\" She looked at\r\nthe Nun. \"Was he?\" she asked merrily.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that it's much good trying to deny it, is it, Jack?\"\r\n\r\nJack was terribly ashamed of himself. \"It wasn't my place to do it. I\r\nbeg your pardon, miss.\" He stooped and picked up his hat, which he had\r\ntaken off and laid on the ground by him. \"Miss Flower's too kind to me,\r\nmiss. She makes me forget my place--and my manners.\"\r\n\r\nVivien held out her hand to him; she was grave now. \"But we're all so\r\nfond of you, Mr. Rock. And I'm sure you weren't saying anything unkind\r\nabout me. Was he, Doris?\"\r\n\r\nJack took her hand. \"It wasn't my place to do it. I ask your pardon.\"\r\nThen he turned to the Nun. \"You'll excuse me, miss?\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun smiled radiantly at him. \"I hate your going, Jack. Perhaps you'd\r\nbetter, though. Only don't be unhappy. There's no harm done, you know.\"\r\n\r\nJack shook his head again sadly, then put his hat on it with a rueful\r\nair. He regarded Vivien for a moment with a ponderous sorrow, lifted his\r\nhat again, shook his head again, and walked out of the garden. The Nun\r\ngave a short gurgle, and then regained a serene and silent composure. It\r\nwas most certainly a case for allowing the other side to take first\r\ninnings! Vivien sat down in the seat that Jack had vacated in such sad\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n\"It was about--Harry?\" she asked slowly. \"You all hear and know! I hear\r\nnothing, I know nothing. Nobody mentions him to me. Not Andy, not my\r\nfather any more. Mr. Belfield said a word or two once--not happy words.\r\nExcept for that--well, he might be dead! I don't see the use of treating\r\nme like that. I think I've a right to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"What Jack said was more about you really. There's no fresh news about\r\nHarry.\"\r\n\r\nWhile saying these words, the Nun allowed her look at Vivien to be very\r\ndirect. \"You must accept that as final,\" the look seemed to say.\r\n\r\n\"Lots of men, good men, make a mistake, one mistake, about things like\r\nthat. He'll be all right now--with his boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's had a love affair, repented of it--and probably started another\r\nsince that event. The child, if I remember, is about five months old.\"\r\nStill with her gaze direct, the Nun laughed. Vivien flushed. \"There's no\r\nother way to take it,\" the Nun assured her.\r\n\r\nVivien spoke low; her cheeks red, her eyes dim. \"I gave him all my\r\nheart, oh, so readily--and such trust! Doris, did he ever make love to\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"As a general rule I don't tell tales. In this case I feel free to say\r\nthat he did.\"\r\n\r\nVivien's smile was woeful. \"What, he wanted to marry you too once?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, he never wanted to marry me, Vivien.\"\r\n\r\nIt was drastic treatment--and the doctor paid for it as well as the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\n\"But you went on being friends with him!\"\r\n\r\n\"I became friends with him again--presently,\" the Nun corrected. \"I\r\nsuppose I don't come well out of it, according to your views. I know the\r\ndifference there is between us in that way. Look at your life and mine!\r\nThat's bound to make a difference. Besides, it would have been taking\r\nhim much too seriously.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you're rather hard, Doris.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God, I am, my dear! I need it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a terrible thing to make the mistake I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's worse to go on with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have liked to go on with it. I feel as people must who've lost\r\ntheir religion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that so sad, if the religion is proved not to be true?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, terribly sad.\" Vivien's back was to the street. She wept silently;\r\nnone saw her tears save Doris. \"I thought I had lost everything. It's\r\nworse to find that you never had anything, and have lost nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's good to find that out, when it's true,\" Doris persisted stoutly.\r\n\"But I hope he won't happen on any more girls like you. With the proper\r\npeople--his Mrs. Freeres and Lady Lucies--the thing's a farce. That's\r\nall right!\"\r\n\r\nHer bitter ridicule pierced the armour of Vivien's recollection. With\r\nthe proper people it was all a farce. She had taken it as a tragedy. Her\r\ntears ceased to flow, but her colour came hot again.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know anything about those women--I never heard their names--but\r\nhe seems to have insulted me almost as much as he insulted you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun was relentless. \"In both cases he considered, and still\r\nconsiders, that he paid a very high compliment. And he'll find lots of\r\nwomen to agree with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doris, be kind to me. I've nobody else!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Lord forgive you for saying so! You've the luck of one girl in ten\r\nthousand.\" Now the Nun's colour grew a little hot; she raised herself on\r\nher elbow. \"Here are your two men. One's going to lead a big life, while\r\nthe other's chasing petticoats!\"\r\n\r\n\"You think the world of Andy, don't you, Doris?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd think the universe of him if he'd give you a shaking.\"\r\n\r\nVivien smiled, rose, came to the Nun, and kissed her. The Nun's lips\r\nquivered. \"He's coming down at the end of the week,\" said Vivien. Her\r\nvoice fell to a whisper. \"He's not quite so patient as you think.\" With\r\nanother kiss she was swiftly gone.\r\n\r\nThe Nun sat on, gazing at Meriton High Street. Sally Dutton came out of\r\nthe house and regarded the same prospect with an air of criticism or\r\neven of disfavour.\r\n\r\n\"I think it's all coming right about Vivien and Andy,\" the Nun remarked.\r\n\r\nSally turned her critical eyes on her friend. \"Have you been helping?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a little bit perhaps, Sally.\" She paused a moment. \"I shall be\r\nrather glad to have it settled.\"\r\n\r\nThe motor-car drew up at the door.\r\n\r\n\"You'll not have more than enough time for lunch before your matinee,\r\nMiss Flower,\" Seymour observed, with his usual indifferent air. Not his\r\nbusiness whether she were in time, but he might as well mention the\r\nmatter!\r\n\r\n\"My hat and cloak!\" cried the Nun, springing up. She took Sally's arm\r\nand ran her into the house with her. \"Hurrah for work, Sally!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly Sally threw her arms round her friend's neck and exclaimed,\r\nwith something very like a sob, \"Oh, my darling, if only you could have\r\neverything you want!\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun's lips quivered again; her bright eyes were a little dim. \"But,\r\nSally dear, I never fall in love!\"\r\n\r\nMiss Dutton relapsed, with equal abruptness, into her habitual\r\ndemeanour.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he's a man--and a fool like all the rest of them!\" she remarked.\r\n\r\nThe Nun gurgled. A record was saved--at the last moment. Because she did\r\nnot cry--any more than she fell in love.\r\n\r\nThe Nun came out, equipped for the journey. She was smiling still. \"Do I\r\nlook all right, Seymour?\"\r\n\r\n\"At the best of your looks, if I may say so, Miss Flower.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you very much, Seymour. Get in with you, Sally! You are a slow\r\ngirl, always!\"\r\n\r\nShe pressed Sally's hand as the car started. \"Much better like this,\r\nreally. I have always Seymour's admiration.\"\r\n\r\nHis name caught Seymour's ear. \"I beg your pardon, Miss Flower?\"\r\n\r\n\"I only said you were an admirable driver, Seymour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Naturally I drive carefully when you're in the car, Miss Flower.\"\r\n\r\n\"There!\" said the Nun triumphantly. \"I told you so, Sally!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVII.\r\n\r\nNOT OF HIS SEEKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAndy Hayes' _debut_ in the House of Commons was not, of course,\r\nsensational; very few members witnessed it, and nobody outside took the\r\nsmallest heed of it. Moreover, like other beginnings of his, it was\r\nunpremeditated, in a manner forced upon him. He had not intended to\r\nspeak that afternoon, or indeed at all in his first session, but in\r\nCommittee one day an honourable gentleman opposite went so glaringly\r\nastray as to the prices ruling for bacon in Wiltshire in the year\r\nnineteen hundred and something--which Andy considered a salient epoch in\r\nthe chequered history of his pet commodity--that he was on his feet\r\nbefore he knew what he was doing, and set the matter right, adding\r\nillustrative figures for the year before and the year after, with a\r\nmodestly worded forecast of the run of prices for the current year.\r\nEngrossed in the subject, he remembered that the House was a formidable\r\nplace only after he had sat down; then he hurried home to his books,\r\nfound that his figures were correct, and heaved a sigh of satisfaction.\r\nIt was no small thing to get his maiden speech made without meaning to\r\nmake it--and to find the figures correct! He attempted nothing more that\r\nsession. He only listened. But how he listened! A man might talk the\r\ngreatest nonsense, yet Andy's steady eyes would be on him, and Andy's\r\nbig head untiringly poised at attention. What was the use of listening\r\nto so much nonsense? Well, first you had to be sure it was nonsense;\r\nthen to see why it was nonsense; thirdly, to see how, being nonsense, it\r\nwas received; fourthly, to revolve how it should be exposed. There were\r\neven other things that Andy found to ponder over in all the nonsense to\r\nwhich he listened--and many more, of course, in the sense.\r\n\r\nBut even Andy took a holiday from public affairs sometimes, nay more,\r\nsometimes from the fortunes of Gilbert Foot and Co. He was in the office\r\nthis morning--the Saturday before Whitsunday--finishing up some odd jobs\r\nwhich his partner had left to him (Gilly had still a trick of doing\r\nthat), but his thoughts were on Meriton, whither he was to repair in the\r\nafternoon. As he mused on Meriton, he slowly shook the big head, thereby\r\nindicating not despair or even despondency, but a recognition that he\r\nwas engaged on rather a difficult job, perhaps on a game that he was not\r\nvery good at, but which had to be won all the same. This particular game\r\ncertainly had to be won; his whole heart was in it. Yet now he was\r\naccusing himself of a mistake; he had been impatient--impatient that\r\nVivien should still be less than happy, that she should still dwell in\r\ngloom with gloomy Wellgood, that she would not yet come into the\r\nsunshine. Well, he would put the mistake right that very day, for Vivien\r\nwas to lunch with him, attended by the Nun, with whom she had been\r\nspending a night or two in town; and then the three of them were to go\r\nto Meriton in the motor-car together. The Nun was not singing at this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"I must go slow,\" concluded Andy, whose friends were already smiling at\r\nthe deliberate gait with which he trod the path of love. \"Hullo, there's\r\nan hour before lunch! I may as well finish some of these accounts for\r\nGilly.\"\r\n\r\nThis satisfaction he was not destined to enjoy. He was interrupted by a\r\nvisitor.\r\n\r\nHarry Belfield came in, really a vision to gladden an artist's eyes, in\r\na summer suit of palest homespun--he affected that material--with his\r\nusual blue tie unusually bright--shirt and socks to match; a dazzlingly\r\nwhite panama hat crowned his wavy dark locks. He looked immensely\r\nhandsome, and he was gay, happy, and affectionate.\r\n\r\n\"Thought I might just find you, old chap, because you're always mugging\r\nwhen everybody else is having a holiday. Look here, I want you to do\r\nsomething for me, or rather for Isobel. I'm off yachting for three or\r\nfour months--rather a jolly party--and Isobel's going to take a house in\r\nthe country for herself and the boy. She doesn't know much about that\r\nsort of business, and I wanted to ask you to let her consult you about\r\nthe terms, and so on, to see she's not done, you know. That'll be all\r\nright, won't it? Because I really haven't time to look after it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. Anything I can do--please tell her. She's not going with\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Harry, putting his foot on the table and regarding it fondly,\r\nas he had at a previous interview in Andy's office. \"No, not this trip,\r\nAndy. She doesn't care much for the sea.\" The slightest smile flickered\r\non his lips. \"Besides, it's 'Men only' on board.\" The smile broadened a\r\nlittle. \"At least we're going to start that way, and they're taking\r\nme--a respectable married man--along with them to help them to keep\r\ntheir good resolutions. Well, old boy, how do you like it in the House?\r\nI haven't observed many orations put down to you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've only spoken once--hardly a speech. But I'm working pretty well at\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet you are! And at it here too, I suppose? Lazy beggar, Gilly\r\nFoot!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gilly's woken up wonderfully. You'd hardly know him.\"\r\n\r\nHarry yawned. \"Well, I'm wanting a rest,\" he said. \"I've had one or two\r\nworries lately. Oh, it's all over now, but I shall be glad to get away\r\nfor a bit. By Jove, Andy, the great thing in life is to be able to go\r\nwhere you like, and when you like\"--his smile flashed out again--\"and\r\nwith whom you like, isn't it? Are you off anywhere for Whitsuntide?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only down to Meriton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quiet!\" But Harry had not always found it so; it was the quieter for\r\nhis absence.\r\n\r\n\"I like being there better than anywhere else,\" was Andy's simple\r\nexplanation of his movements.\r\n\r\nA clerk came in and handed him a card. \"I told the lady you had somebody\r\nwith you, and asked her to take a seat in the outer room for a moment.\"\r\n\r\nAndy read the card. \"I'll ring,\" he said absently, and looked across at\r\nHarry.\r\n\r\n\"Lady? Eminent authoress? Or is this not business? Have her in--don't\r\nhide her, Andy!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's Vivien Wellgood.\"\r\n\r\nHarry turned his head sharply. \"What brings her here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I was to meet her and Doris Flower for lunch, and go down\r\nwith them to Meriton afterwards. Perhaps something's happened to stop\r\nit, and she's come to tell me.\"\r\n\r\nA curious smile adorned Harry's handsome features. He looked doubtful,\r\nyet decidedly interested.\r\n\r\n\"I'd better go out and see her,\" said Andy. \"I mustn't keep her\r\nwaiting.\"\r\n\r\nHarry broke into a laugh, half of amusement, half of impatience. \"You\r\nneedn't look so infernally solemn over it! It won't kill her to bow to\r\nme--or even to shake hands.\"\r\n\r\nAndy came to a sudden resolution. Since chance willed it this way, this\r\nway it should be.\r\n\r\n\"As you please!\" he said, and rang the bell.\r\n\r\nHarry rose to his feet, and took off the panama hat, which he had kept\r\non during his talk with Andy. His eyes were bright; the smile flickered\r\nagain on his lips. He had not seen Vivien since that night--and that\r\nnight seemed a very long way off to Harry Belfield.\r\n\r\nIn the brief space before the door reopened, a vision danced before\r\nAndy's eyes--a vision of Curly the retriever, and of a girl standing\r\nmotionless in fear, and yet, because he was there, not so much afraid.\r\nIn his mind was the idea which had suddenly taken shape under the\r\nimpulsion of chance--that she had better face the present than dream of\r\nthe past, better see the man who was nothing to her, than pore over the\r\nmemory of him who had been everything. She might--nay, probably\r\nwould--resent an encounter thus sprung upon her. Andy knew it; in this\r\nmoment, with the choice suddenly presented, he chose to act for himself.\r\nPerhaps, for once in his life, he yielded to a sort of superstition, a\r\nfeeling that the chance was not for nothing, that they three would not\r\nmeet together again without result. Mingled with this was anger that\r\nHarry should take the encounter with his airy lightness, that his eyes\r\nshould be bright and his lips bent in a smile. Andy was ready for the\r\nlast round of the fight--and ready to take his chance. Suddenly under\r\nthe pressure of his thoughts--perforce, as it were--he spoke out to\r\nHarry.\r\n\r\n\"None of this has been of my seeking,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"None of what? What do you mean, old fellow?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no time for answer. Vivien was in the room, and the clerk\r\nclosed the door after she had entered.\r\n\r\nShe stood for a moment on the threshold and then moved quickly to Andy's\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\"I knew,\" she said. \"I heard your voices.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm just going,\" said Harry. \"I won't interrupt you. I had a hope that\r\nyou wouldn't mind just shaking hands with an old friend. I should like\r\nit--awfully!\" His smile now was pleading, propitiatory, yet with the\r\nlurking hint that there was sentimental interest in the situation;\r\npossibly, though he could not be convicted of this idea--it was too\r\nelusively suggested--that there was, after all, a dash of the amusing.\r\n\r\nShe paused long on her answer. At last she spoke quietly, in a friendly\r\nvoice. \"Yes, I'll shake hands with you, Harry. Because it's all over.\"\r\nShe smiled faintly. \"I'll shake hands with you if Andy will let me.\"\r\n\r\n\"If Andy--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; because my hand belongs to him now. I came here to tell him so\r\nthis morning.\" She passed her left arm through Andy's and held out her\r\nright hand towards Harry. Her lips quivered as she looked up for a\r\nmoment at Andy's face. He patted her hand gently, but his eyes were set\r\non Harry Belfield.\r\n\r\nThe hand she offered Harry did not take. He stretched out his for his\r\nhat, and picked it up from the table in a shaking grip. The smile had\r\ngone from his lips; his eyes were heavy and resentful; he found no more\r\neloquent, appropriate words.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, so that's it?\" he said with a sullen sneer.\r\n\r\n\"It's none of it been of my seeking,\" Andy protested again. In this last\r\nmoment of the fight the old feeling came strong upon him. He pleaded\r\nthat he had been loyal to Harry, that he was no usurper; it had never\r\nbeen in his mind.\r\n\r\nHarry stood in silence, fingering his hat. He cast a glance across at\r\nthem--where they stood opposite to him, side by side, her arm in Andy's.\r\nVery fresh across his memory struck the look on her face--the trustful\r\nhappiness which had followed on the tremulous joy evoked by his\r\nwonderful words. It was not his nor for him any more, that look. He\r\nhated that it should be Andy's. He gave the old impatient protesting\r\nshrug of his shoulders. What other comment was there to make? He was\r\nwhat he was--and these things happened! The Restless Master plays these\r\ndisconcerting tricks on his devoted servants.\r\n\r\n\"Well, good-bye,\" he mumbled.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Harry,\" said both, she in her clear soft voice, Andy in his\r\nweightier note, both with a grave pity which recognised, even as did his\r\nshrug of the shoulders, that there was no more to be said. It was just\r\ngood-bye, just a parting of the ways, a severing of lives. Even good\r\nwishes would have seemed a mockery; from neither side were they offered.\r\n\r\nWith one more look, another slightest shrug, Harry Belfield turned his\r\nback on them. They stood without moving till the door closed behind him.\r\n\r\nHe was gone. Andy gave a deep sigh and dropped into the arm-chair by his\r\noffice desk. Vivien bent over him, her hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you let me meet him, Andy?\"\r\n\r\nAndy was long in answering. He was revolving the processes of his own\r\nmind, the impulse under which he had acted, why he had exposed her to\r\nsuch an ordeal as had once been in the day's work at Nutley.\r\n\r\n\"It was a chance, your coming while he was here, we three being here\r\ntogether. But since it happened like that\"--he raised his eyes to\r\nhers--\"well, I just thought that neither of us ought to funk him.\" The\r\nutterance seemed a simple result of so much cogitation.\r\n\r\nBut Vivien laughed softly as she daintily and daringly laid her hand on\r\nAndy's big head.\r\n\r\n\"If I 'funked him' still, I shouldn't have come at all,\" she said. \"I\r\nthink I'm just getting to know something about you, Andy. You're like\r\nsome big thing in a dim light; one only sees you very gradually. I used\r\nto think of you as fetching and carrying, you know.\"\r\n\r\nAndy chuckled contentedly. \"You thought about right,\" he said. \"That's\r\nwhat I'm always doing, just what I'm fit for. I shall go on doing it all\r\nmy life, fetching and carrying for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not only for me, I think. For everybody; perhaps even for the\r\nnation--for the world, Andy!\"\r\n\r\nHe caught the little hand that was playing over his broad brow. \"For you\r\nfirst. As for the rest of it--!\" He broke into a laugh. \"I say, Vivien,\r\nthe first time I saw you I was following the hounds on foot! That's all\r\nI can do. The hunt gets out of sight, but sometimes you can tell where\r\nit's going. That's about my form. Now if I was a clever chap like\r\nHarry!\"\r\n\r\nWith a laugh that was half a sob she kissed his upturned face. \"Keep me\r\nsafe, keep me safe, Andy!\" she whispered.\r\n\r\nAndy slowly rose to his feet, and, turning, faced her. He took her hands\r\nin his. \"By Jove, you kissed me! You kissed me, Vivien!\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed merrily. \"Well, of course I did! Isn't it--usual?\"\r\n\r\nAndy smiled. \"If things like that are going to be usual--well, life's\r\nlooking a bit different!\" he said.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there were wild sounds in the outer office--a door slammed, a\r\nfurious sweet voice, a swish of skirts. The door of the inner office\r\nflew open.\r\n\r\n\"What about lunch?\" demanded the Nun accusingly.\r\n\r\n\"I'd forgotten it!\" Vivien exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"So had I, but I'm awfully hungry, now I come to think of it,\" said\r\nAndy. \"The usual place?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the Nun. \"Somewhere else. Harry's there--lunching alone! The\r\nfirst time I ever saw him do that!\" She looked at the pair of them. Her\r\nremark seemed not to make the least impression. It did not matter where\r\nor how Harry Belfield lunched. She looked again from Vivien to Andy,\r\nfrom Andy to Vivien.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Doris,\" said Vivien meekly.\r\n\r\nThe Nun addressed Andy severely. \"Mrs. Belfield will consider that\r\nyou're marrying above your station, Andy.\"\r\n\r\nAndy scratched his big head. \"Yes, Doris, and she'll be quite right,\" he\r\nsaid apologetically. \"Of course she will! But a fellow can only--well,\r\ntake things as they come.\" He broke into his hearty laugh. \"What'll old\r\nJack say?\"\r\n\r\nThe Nun knew what old Jack would say--very privately. \"I wish it had\r\nbeen you, miss!\" But she had no envy in her heart.\r\n\r\n\"For people who do fall in love, it must be rather pleasant,\" she\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n\"The worst of it is, I've got so little time,\" said Andy.\r\n\r\nThe two girls laughed. \"I only want you to have time to be in love with\r\none girl,\" Vivien explained reassuringly.\r\n\r\n\"And, perhaps, just friends with another,\" the Nun added.\r\n\r\nAndy joined in the laughter. \"I shall fit those two things in all\r\nright!\" he declared.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon saw them back at Meriton; it was there that Andy Hayes\r\ntruly tasted the flavour of his good fortune. There the winning of\r\nVivien seemed no isolated achievement, not a bit of luck standing by\r\nitself, but the master-knot among the many ties that now bound him to\r\nhis home. The old bonds held; the new came. In the greetings of friends\r\nof every degree--from Chinks, the Bird, and Miss Miles, up to the great\r\nLord Meriton himself--in Wellgood's hard and curt, yet ready and in\r\ntruth triumphant, endorsement of an arrangement that banned the very\r\nthought of the man he hated, in old Jack's satisfaction in the vision of\r\nAndy in due time reigning at Nutley itself (his bit of sentiment about\r\nthe Nun was almost swallowed up in this)--most of all perhaps in\r\nBelfield's cordial yet sad acceptance of his son's supplanter--he found\r\nthe completion of the first stage of his life's journey and the\r\ndefinition of its future course and of its goal. His face was set\r\ntowards his destination; the love and confidence of the friends of a\r\nlifetime accompanied, cheered, and aided his steady progress. No high\r\nthoughts were in his mind. To find time for the work of the day, his own\r\nand what other people were always so ready to leave to him, and to move\r\non a little--that was his task, that bounded his ambition. Anything else\r\nthat came was, as he had said to Harry Belfield, not of his seeking--and\r\nnever ceased rather to surprise him, to be received by him with the\r\ntouch of simple wonder, which made men smile at him even while they\r\nadmired and followed, which made women laugh, and in a sense pity, while\r\nthey trusted and loved. He saw the smiles and laughter, and thought them\r\nnatural. Slowly he came to rely on the love and trust, and in the\r\nstrength of them found his own strength growing, his confidence\r\ngradually maturing.\r\n\r\n\"With you beside me, and all the dear old set round me, and Meriton\r\nbehind me, I ought to be able to get through,\" he said to Vivien as they\r\nwalked together in the wood at Nutley before dinner.\r\n\r\nShe stopped by a bench, rudely fashioned out of a tree trunk. \"Lend me\r\nyour knife, Andy, please.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave it to her, and stood watching while she stooped and scratched\r\nwith the knife on the side of the bench. Certain initials were scratched\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" he asked, pointing to the spot where they had been.\r\n\r\n\"Only a memorandum of something I don't want to remember any more,\" she\r\nanswered. She came back to him, blushing a little, smiling, yet with\r\ntears in her eyes. \"Yes, Meriton, and the old friends, and I--we're all\r\nwith you now--all of us with all our hearts now, dear Andy!\"\r\n\r\nAndy made his last protest. \"I'd have been loyal to him all my life, if\r\nhe'd have let me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it. And so would I. But he wouldn't let us.\" She took his arm as\r\nthey turned away from the bench. \"The sorrow must be in our hearts\r\nalways, I think. But now it's sorrow for him, not for ourselves, Andy.\"\r\n\r\nIn the hour of his own triumph, because of the greatness of his own joy,\r\ntenderness for his friend revived.\r\n\r\n\"Dear old chap! How handsome he looked to-day!\"\r\n\r\nVivien pressed his arm. \"You can say that as often as you like! There's\r\nno danger from him now!\"\r\n\r\nThe shadow passed from Andy Hayes' face as he turned to his own great\r\njoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Notes on\r\n                         Nelson's New Novels.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _No work of unwholesome character or\r\n                    of second-rate quality will be\r\n                       included in this Series._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe novel is to-day _the_ popular form of literary art. This is proved\r\nby the number of novels published, and by the enormous sales of fiction\r\nat popular prices.\r\n\r\nWhile _Reprints_ of fiction may be purchased for a few pence, _New\r\nFiction_ is still a luxury.\r\n\r\nThe author of a New Novel loses his larger audience, the public are\r\ndenied the privilege of enjoying his latest work, because of the\r\nprohibitive price of 4s. 6d. demanded for the ordinary \"six shilling\"\r\nnovel.\r\n\r\nIn another way both author and public are badly served under the present\r\npublishing system. At certain seasons a flood of new novels pours from\r\nthe press. Selection becomes almost impossible. The good novels are lost\r\namong the indifferent and the bad. Good service can be done to\r\nliterature not only by reducing the price of fiction, but by sifting its\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nThe number of publishers issuing new fiction is so great, that the\r\nentrance of another firm into the field demands almost an apology--at\r\nleast, a word of explanation.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Nelson have been pioneers in the issue of reprints of fiction in\r\nLibrary Edition at Sevenpence. The success of _Nelson's Library_ has\r\nbeen due to the careful selection of books, regular publication\r\nthroughout the whole year, and excellence of manufacture at a low cost,\r\ndue to perfection of machinery.\r\n\r\nNelson's Sevenpenny Library represents the best that can be given to the\r\npublic in the way of _Reprints_ under present manufacturing conditions.\r\n\r\nNelson's New Novels (of which this book is one of the first volumes)\r\nrepresents the same standard of careful selection, excellence of\r\nproduction, and lowest possible price applied to _New Fiction_.\r\n\r\nThe list of authors of Nelson's New Novels for 1910 includes Anthony\r\nHope, E. F. Benson, H. A. Vachell, H. G. Wells, \"Q,\" G. A. Birmingham,\r\nJohn Masefield, Mrs. W. K. Clifford, J. C. Snaith, John Buchan, and\r\nAgnes and Egerton Castle. Arrangements for subsequent volumes have been\r\nmade with other authors of equally high standing.\r\n\r\nNelson's New Novels are of the ordinary \"six shilling\" size, but are\r\nproduced with greater care than most of their competitors. They are\r\nprinted in large, clear type, on a fine white paper. They are strongly\r\nbound in green cloth with a white and gold design. They are decorated\r\nwith a pretty end-paper and a coloured frontispiece. All the volumes are\r\nissued in bright wrappers. The books are a happy combination of\r\nsubstantial and artistic qualities.\r\n\r\nA new volume is issued regularly every month.\r\n\r\nThe price is the very lowest at which a large New Novel with good\r\nmaterial and workmanship, and with an adequate return to author,\r\nbookseller, and publisher, can be offered to the public at the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Descriptive Notes\r\n                      on the Volumes for 1910_:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  FORTUNE.                                       _J. C. Snaith._\r\n\r\nMr. J. C. Snaith is already known to fame by his historical novels, his\r\nadmirable cricketing story, his essay in Meredithan subtlety \"Brooke of\r\nCovenden,\" and his most successful Victorian comedy \"Araminta.\" In his\r\nnew novel he breaks ground which has never before been touched by an\r\nEnglish novelist. He follows no less a leader than Cervantes. His\r\nhero, Sir Richard Pendragon, is Sir John Falstaff grown athletic and\r\ncourageous, with his imagination fired by much adventure in far\r\ncountries and some converse with the knight of La Mancha. The doings\r\nof this monstrous Englishman are narrated by a young and scandalized\r\nSpanish squire, full of all the pedantry of chivalry. Sir Richard is a\r\nnew type in literature--the Rabelaisian Paladin, whose foes flee not\r\nonly from his sword but from his Gargantuan laughter. In Mr. Snaith's\r\nromance there are many delightful characters--a Spanish lady who\r\ndictates to armies, a French prince of the blood who has forsaken his\r\nbirthright for the highroad. But all are dominated by the immense Sir\r\nRichard, who rights wrongs like an unruly Providence, and then rides\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE HISTORY OF MR. POLLY.                       _H. G. Wells._\r\n\r\nIf the true aim of romance is to find beauty and laughter and heroism in\r\nodd places, then Mr. Wells is a great romantic. His heroes are not\r\nknights and adventurers, not even members of the quasi-romantic\r\nprofessions, but the ordinary small tradesmen, whom the world has\r\nhitherto neglected. The hero of the new book, Mr. Alfred Polly, is of\r\nthe same school, but he is nearer Hoopdriver than Kipps. He is in the\r\nlast resort the master of his fate, and squares himself defiantly\r\nagainst the Destinies. Unlike the others, he has a literary sense, and\r\nhas a strange fantastic culture of his own. Mr. Wells has never written\r\nanything more human or more truly humorous than the adventures of Mr.\r\nPolly as haberdasher's apprentice, haberdasher, incendiary, and tramp.\r\nMr. Polly discovers the great truth that, however black things may be,\r\nthere is always a way out for a man if he is bold enough to take it,\r\neven though that way leads through fire and revolution. The last part of\r\nthe book, where the hero discovers his courage, is a kind of saga. We\r\nleave him in the end at peace with his own soul, wondering dimly about\r\nthe hereafter, having proved his manhood, and found his niche in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DAISY'S AUNT.                                  _E. F. Benson._\r\n\r\nIt is Mr. Benson's chief merit that, without losing the lightness of\r\ntouch which makes good comedy, he keeps a firm hold upon the graver\r\nmatters which make good fiction. The present book is a tale of\r\nconspiracy--the plot of a beautiful woman to save her young niece from a\r\nman whom she regards as a blackguard. None of Mr. Benson's women are\r\nmore attractive than these two, who fight for long at cross-purposes,\r\nand end, as all honest natures must, with a truer understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE OTHER SIDE.                               _H. A. Vachell._\r\n\r\nIn this remarkable book Mr. Vachell leaves the beaten highway of\r\nromance, and grapples with the deepest problems of human personality and\r\nthe unseen. It is a story of a musical genius, in whose soul worldliness\r\nconquers spirituality. When he is at the height of his apparent success,\r\nthere comes an accident, and for a little soul and body seem to\r\nseparate. On his return to ordinary life he sees the world with other\r\neyes, but his clearness of vision has come too late to save his art. He\r\npays for his earlier folly in artistic impotence. The book is a profound\r\nmoral allegory, and none the less a brilliant romance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SIR GEORGE'S OBJECTION.                 _Mrs. W. K. Clifford._\r\n\r\nMrs. Clifford raises the old problem of heredity, and gives it a very\r\nmodern and scientific answer. It is the story of a woman who, after her\r\nhusband's disgrace and death, settles with her only daughter upon the\r\nshore of one of the Italian lakes. The girl grows up in ignorance of her\r\nfamily history, but when the inevitable young man appears complications\r\nbegin. As it happens, Sir George, the father of the lover, holds the\r\nold-fashioned cast-iron doctrine of heredity, and the story shows the\r\nconflict between his pedantry and the compulsion of fact. It is a book\r\nfull of serious interest for all readers, and gives us in addition a\r\ncharming love story. Mrs. Clifford has drawn many delightful women, but\r\nKitty and her mother must stand first in her gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PRESTER JOHN.                                   _John Buchan._\r\n\r\nThis is a story which, in opposition to all accepted canons of romance,\r\npossesses no kind of heroine. There is no woman from beginning to end in\r\nthe book, unless we include a little Kaffir serving-girl. The hero is a\r\nScottish lad, who goes as assistant to a store in the far north of the\r\nTransvaal. By a series of accidents he discovers a plot for a great\r\nKaffir rising, and by a combination of luck and courage manages to\r\nfrustrate it. From the beginning to end it is a book of stark adventure.\r\nThe leader of the rising is a black missionary, who believes himself the\r\nincarnation of the mediaeval Abyssinian emperor Prester John. By means of\r\na perverted Christianity, and the possession of the ruby collar which\r\nfor centuries has been the Kaffir fetish, he organizes the natives of\r\nSouthern Africa into a great army. But a revolution depends upon small\r\nthings, and by frustrating the leader in these small things, the young\r\nstorekeeper wins his way to fame and fortune. It is a book for all who\r\nare young enough in heart to enjoy a record of straightforward\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LADY GOOD-FOR-NOTHING.                                  \"_Q._\"\r\n\r\nSir Oliver Vyell, a descendant of Oliver Cromwell, is the British\r\nCollector of Customs at the port of Boston in the days before the\r\nAmerican Revolution. While there he runs his head against New England\r\nPuritanism, rescues a poor girl who has been put in the stocks for\r\nSabbath-breaking, carries her off, and has her educated. The story deals\r\nwith the development of Ruth Josselin from a half-starved castaway to a\r\nbeautiful and subtle woman. Sir Oliver falls in love with his ward, and\r\nshe becomes my Lady and the mistress of a great house; but to the New\r\nEnglanders she remains a Sabbath-breaker and \"Lady-Good-for-Nothing.\"\r\nThe scene moves to Lisbon, whither Sir Oliver goes on Government\r\nservice, and there is a wonderful picture of the famous earthquake. The\r\nbook is a story of an act of folly, and its heavy penalties, and also\r\nthe record of the growth of two characters--one from atheism to\r\nreverence, and the other from a bitter revolt against the world to a\r\nwiser philosophy. The tale is original in scheme and setting, and the\r\natmosphere and thought of another age are brilliantly reproduced. No\r\nbetter historical romance has been written in our times.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PANTHER'S CUB.                     _Agnes and Egerton Castle._\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a world-famed prima donna, whose only daughter has\r\nbeen brought up in a very different world from that in which her mother\r\nlives. When the child grows to womanhood she joins her mother, and the\r\nproblem of the book is the conflict of the two temperaments--the one\r\nsophisticated and undisciplined, and the other simple and sincere. The\r\nscenes are laid in Vienna and London, amid all types of society--smart,\r\nartistic, and diplomatic. Against the Bohemian background the authors\r\nhave worked out a very beautiful love story of a young diplomatist and\r\nthe singer's daughter. The book is full of brilliant character-sketches\r\nand dramatic moments.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TREPANNED.                                   _John Masefield._\r\n\r\nMr. Masefield has already won high reputation as poet and dramatist, and\r\nhis novel \"Captain Margaret\" showed him to be a romancer of a higher\r\norder. \"Trepanned\" is a story of adventure in Virginia and the Spanish\r\nMain. A Kentish boy is trepanned and carried off to sea, and finds his\r\nfill of adventure among Indians and buccaneers. The central episode of\r\nthe book is a quest for the sacred Aztec temple. The swift drama of the\r\nnarrative, and the poetry and imagination of the style, make the book in\r\nthe highest sense literature. It should appeal not only to all lovers of\r\ngood writing, but to all who care for the record of stirring deeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE SIMPKINS PLOT.                     _George A. Birmingham._\r\n\r\n\"Spanish Gold\" has been the most mirth-provoking of Irish novels\r\npublished in the last few years, and Mr. Birmingham's new book is a\r\nworthy successor. Once more the admirable red-haired curate, \"J. J.,\"\r\nappears, and his wild energy turns a peaceful neighbourhood into a\r\nhotbed of intrigue and suspicion. The story tells how he discovers in a\r\nharmless lady novelist, seeking quiet for her work, a murderess whose\r\ntrial had been a _cause celebre_. He forms a scheme of marrying the lady\r\nto the local bore, in the hope that she may end his career. Once started\r\non the wrong tack, he works out his evidence with convincing logic, and\r\nties up the whole neighbourhood in the toils of his misconception. The\r\nbook is full of the wittiest dialogue and the most farcical situations.\r\nIt will be as certain to please all lovers of Irish humour as the\r\nimmortal \"Experiences of an Irish R. M.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THOMAS NELSON AND SONS,\r\n             London, Edinburgh, Dublin, and New York.",
