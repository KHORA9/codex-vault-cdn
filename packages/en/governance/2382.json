A., DELEGATE ELECT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON: HENRY POLKINHORN, PRINTER. 1857.\r\n\r\n\"The NEW TERRITORY of ARIZONA, better known as the GADSDEN PURCHASE,\r\nlies between the thirty-first and thirty-third parallels of latitude,\r\nand is bounded on the north by the Gila River, which separates it from\r\nthe territory of New Mexico; on the east by the Rio Bravo del Norte,\r\n(Rio Grande), which separates it from Texas; on the south by Chihuahua\r\nand Sonora, Mexican provinces; and on the west by the Colorado River of\r\nthe West, which separates it from Upper and Lower California. This\r\ngreat region is six hundred miles long by about fifty miles wide, and\r\nembraces an area of about thirty thousand square miles. It was acquired\r\nby purchase from Mexico, during the mission of General Gadsden, at a\r\ncost of ten millions of dollars. In the original treaty, as negotiated\r\nby General Gadsden, a more southern boundary than the one adopted by\r\nthe Senate of the United States in confirming the treaty, was conceded\r\nby Santa Anna. The line at present is irregular in its course, and cuts\r\noff from our Territory the head of the Santa Cruz river and valley, the\r\nSonoita valley, the San Bernardino valley, the whole course of the\r\nColorado river from a point twenty miles below the mouth of the Gila\r\nriver, and, worse than all, the control of the head of the Gulf of\r\nCalifornia, and the rich and extensive valley of Lake Guzman, besides a\r\nlarge and extremely valuable silver region, well known both to Mexicans\r\nand Americans--the planchas de la Platte. General Gadsden's line\r\nincluded nearly all the territory south of the Gila river to the\r\nthirty-first parallel of latitude--all the advantages above\r\nmentioned--gave us the mouth of the Colorado river, and probably a port\r\nnear the head of the gulf at Adair's Bay. We have no accurate survey of\r\nthe west coast of the Gulf of California, but I am strongly of opinion\r\nthat the original line conceded by Mexico would have thrown a portion\r\nof the gulf into American hands, by cutting off an arm of it extending\r\neast and north from the main body of water. A port on the gulf is of\r\ngreat and immediate necessity to our Pacific possessions. Of this\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nThe proposed boundaries, of the Territory of Arizona, are the 34th\r\nparallel of latitude, with New Mexico on the north, from the 103d\r\nmeridian west to the Colorado; Texas on the east; Texas, and the\r\nMexican provinces of New Mexico and Sonora on the south; and California\r\non the west. The new Territory would thus contain within its borders\r\nthe three largest rivers on the Continent, west of the Mississippi--the\r\nRio Grande, Gila, and Colorado of the west, and embrace 90,000 square\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe Gadsden purchase is attached by act of Congress to the Territory of\r\nNew Mexico. At the time of its acquisition there was scarcely any\r\npopulation except a few scattering Mexicans in the Mesilla valley, and\r\nat the old town of Tucson, in the centre of the territory. The Apache\r\nIndian, superior in strength to the Mexican, had gradually extirpated\r\nevery trace of civilization, and roamed uninterrupted and unmolested,\r\nsole possessor of what was once a thriving and populous Spanish\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nExcept the report of Col. A. B. Gray, there is scarcely anything in\r\nprint with reference to the early history of Arizona, beyond the scanty\r\nbut valuable notes of Major Emory and Hon. John R. Bartlett, in their\r\nreports, and in the appendix to Wilson's late book, \"Mexico and its\r\nReligion.\" To this last I beg to refer any reader who desires accurate\r\ninformation respecting the Northern Mexican provinces, presented in a\r\nstraightforward common-sense style.\r\n\r\nIn the possession of the writer of these notes is a map drawn in 1757,\r\njust one hundred years ago, presented by the Society of Jesuits to the\r\nKing of Spain. The original of this map is now in the archives of the\r\nMexican Government. It was copied, with the notes relating to the\r\nTerritory, and to Sonora, Chihuahua, and Sinaloa, by Capt. C. P. Stone,\r\nlate of the United States Army. The map bears the inscription, \"Carte\r\nlevee par la Societe des Jesuites, dediee au Roi d'Espagne en 1757.\"\r\n\r\nThe copy of the map and the accompanying notes are certified as\r\naccurate by the officer of the Mexican Government in charge of the\r\narchives.\r\n\r\nMy information, therefore, upon the early history of this comparatively\r\nunknown domain, is accurate and reliable. As early as 1687, a Jesuit\r\nmissionary from the province of Sonora, which, in its southern portion,\r\nbore already the impress of Spanish civilization, descended the valley\r\nof Santa Cruz river to the Gila. Passing down the Gila to its mouth,\r\nafter exploring the country, he retraced his steps, penetrated the\r\ncountry north of the Gila river for some distance, and ascended the\r\nSalinas or Salt river, and other northern branches of the Gila. The\r\nexplorations of this energetic priest did not stop here. Proceeding\r\neast, he explored the valley of the San Pedro and its branches, thence\r\nalong the Gila to the Mimbres, and probably to the Rio Grande and the\r\nMesilla valley. Filled with the enthusiasm of his sect, he procured\r\nauthority from the head of the order in Mexico, and established\r\nmissions and settlements at every available point. In a report to the\r\ngovernment of the viceroy of Spain, made during the early settlement of\r\nthe province, I find the following language: \"A scientific exploration\r\nof Sonora, with reference to mineralogy, along with the introduction of\r\nfamilies, will lead to a discovery of gold and silver so marvellous\r\nthat the result will be such as has never yet been seen in the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe reports of the immense mineral wealth of the new country, made by\r\nthe Jesuits, induced a rapid settlement. There are laid down on the map\r\nbefore me more than forty towns and villages. Many of these were of\r\nconsiderable size. There were a few north of the Gila, and several on\r\nthe lower Gila, near the Colorado. The Santa Cruz and its tributary\r\nvalleys teemed with an agricultural and mining population. Thousands of\r\nenterprising Spaniards cultivated the rich valley of the San Pedro, and\r\nscattered settlements flourished at every suitable stream and spring at\r\nthe foot of the mountains towards the Rio Grande. The notes before me\r\nsay: \"All these settlements and missions were founded in fertile\r\nvalleys, and by streams and springs, which produced luxuriant crops of\r\nwheat, corn, and beans, and in many parts grapes and other foreign\r\nfruits were cultivated.\"\r\n\r\nIn the western part of the Territory were the missions of St. Pierre,\r\nSt. Paul, St. Matthias, St. Simond, St. Francisco, Merci, the ranches\r\nof Eau Cheri, Eau de la Lune, and others; on the Santa Cruz the\r\nmissions of San Xavier del Bac, Santiago, San Cayetano, and San\r\nPhilipe, the towns of Tueson, Tubac, Reges, San Augusta, and many\r\nothers. San Xavier del Bac is still in existence. It is a mission\r\nchurch of great size and beauty, magnificently ornamented within; forty\r\nthousand dollars in solid silver served to adorn the altar. Upon the\r\nSan Pedro river were the missions of St. Mark, San Salvadore, San\r\nPantaleon, Santa Cruz, and the towns of Quiduria, Rosario, Eugenia,\r\nVictoria, and San Fernando--the latter at the mouth--with many more. To\r\nthe east some small settlements were found on the Valle del Sauz, on\r\nthe Mimbres, at the copper mines north of the Mimbres, and to the south\r\nthe immense grazing and stock-raising establishment of San Bernardino,\r\nwhere since have been raised hundreds of thousands of cattle and\r\nhorses. The Indians in the vicinity of the missions were reduced first\r\nto obedience by the Jesuits, and then to slavery by the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nThe notes referred to above contain the names and localities of more\r\nthan a hundred silver and gold mines which were worked with great\r\nsuccess by the Spaniards. The survey of the Jesuit priest about 1687\r\nwas repeated in 1710 with renewed discoveries, and consequent accession\r\nof population. From this time up to 1757 the conquest and settlement of\r\nthe country was prosecuted with vigor, both by the Jesuits' Society and\r\nSpanish government.\r\n\r\nThe missions and settlements were repeatedly destroyed by the Apaches,\r\nand the priests and settlers massacred or driven off. As often were\r\nthey re-established. The Indians at length, thoroughly aroused by the\r\ncruelties of the Spaniards, by whom they were deprived of their\r\nliberty, forced to labor in the silver mines with inadequate food, and\r\nbarbarously treated, finally rose, joined with tribes who had never\r\nbeen subdued, and gradually drove out or massacred their oppressors. A\r\nsuperior civilization disappeared before their devastating career, and\r\nto day there is scarcely a trace of it left, except scarcely visible\r\nruins, evidence everywhere, of extensive and hastily-deserted mining\r\noperations, and the tradition of the country. The mission of San Xavier\r\ndel Bac, and the old towns of Tueson and Tubac, are the most prominent\r\nof these remains. The labors of the Jesuits to civilize the Indians are\r\nstill evident in the mission Indians, the Papagos and Pimas, who live\r\nin villages, cultivate crops of corn and wheat, and who, in the\r\nChristian and human elements of good faith and charity, are, to say the\r\nleast, in no way inferior to the Mexicans. After the massacre of four\r\nof Crabbe's unfortunate party near Sonoita by the Mexicans, the Papago\r\nIndians buried carefully the bodies to which Mexican inhumanity had\r\ndenied this last charitable office. It is a curious and suggestive fact\r\nthat the latitude of places upon Gila, Santa Cruz, and San Pedro,\r\ndetermined by the Jesuits about 1750, has lately been verified by the\r\nobservations of Park Michler, and Emory. The instruments used by the\r\nJesuits were constructed by them, the lenses being made from pebbles.\r\n\r\nFrom 1757 down to 1820, the Spaniards and Mexicans continued to work\r\nmany valuable mines near Barbacora, and the notes in my possession\r\nspeak of many silver mines, most of which contained a percentage of\r\ngold. \"The San Pedro gold mine in 1748 was worked with extraordinary\r\nsuccess.\" Among the mines anciently worked, as laid down in the\r\nauthorities heretofore referred to, were the Dolores, San Antonio, Casa\r\nGordo, Cabrisa, San Juan Batista, Santa Anna, (which was worked to the\r\ndepth of one hundred and twenty yards,) Rosario, Cata de Agua,\r\nGuadaloupe, Connilla, Prieta, Santa Catarina, Guzopa, Huratano, Arpa,\r\nDescuhidara, Nacosare, Arguage, Churinababi, Huacal, Pinal, and a great\r\nnumber of others which it would only be tedious to mention.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated modern localities are Arivaca, (also anciently\r\nfamous as Aribac,) Sopori, the Arizona mountains, the Santa Rita range,\r\nthe Cerro Colorado, the entire vicinity of Tubac, the Del Ajo, or\r\nArizona copper mine, the Gadsonia copper mine, and the Gila river\r\ncopper mines. These last are situated directly upon the Gila, only\r\ntwenty-five miles from its mouth. The writer assures the public that\r\nthere is no room for doubt as to the authenticity of these statements,\r\nor the immense resources of the new Territory in silver, copper, and\r\nprobably gold. As late as 1820, the Mina Cobre de la Plata, (silver\r\ncopper mines,) near Fort Webster, north of the Gila, were worked to\r\ngreat advantage; and so rich was the ore that it paid for\r\ntransportation on muleback more than a thousand miles to the city of\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nEvery exploration within the past few years has confirmed the\r\nstatements of the ancient records. The testimony of living Mexicans,\r\nand the tradition of the country, all tend to the same end. Col. A. B.\r\nGray, Col. Emory, Lt. Michler, Lt. Parke, the Hon. John R. Bartlett,\r\nlate of the United States Boundary Commission, all agree in the\r\nstatement that the Territory has immense resources in silver and\r\ncopper. Col. Emory says in his report:\r\n\r\n\"On account of the Gold Mania in California I kept the search for gold\r\nand other precious metals as much out of view as possible, scarcely\r\nallowing it to be a matter of conversation, much less of actual search.\r\nYet, enough was ascertained to convince us that the whole region was\r\nteeming with the precious metals. We everywhere saw the remains of\r\nmining operations, conducted by the Spaniards, and more recently by the\r\nMexicans.\"\r\n\r\nThe report enumerates at considerable length the various localities\r\nexamined by Col. Emory's party, and others, of which there could be no\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nIn view of these authorities, it is hoped that those who will not\r\nbelieve upon any evidence, will be content in their own incredulity.\r\nThe most authentic reports of these immense mineral resources have been\r\nused as authorities against their existence. The authors of these\r\ndenials either have never read what they pretend to quote, or think no\r\none else has. The Hon. T. Butler King, who was the first to reveal to\r\nan incredulous public the wonders of the California gold mines, has had\r\nthe singular good fortune to be also among the first to publish correct\r\nand authentic information relating to the silver treasures of Arizona.\r\nHis report upon the resources of the new Territory has all the charm to\r\nthe reader that his California report had, and its brilliant\r\npredictions will be as fully realized. To Gray and Emory is the country\r\nmost indebted for the earliest and most important discoveries.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural resources of Arizona, are sufficient to sustain a\r\nlarge mining population, and afford abundant supplies for the great\r\nimmigration which will follow the development of its mineral resources.\r\nThe whole valley of the Gila, more than four hundred miles in length,\r\ncan be made with proper exertion to yield plentiful crops. The Pimos\r\nIndians, who live in villages on the Gila, one hundred and seventy\r\nmiles from its mouth, raise large crops of cotton, wheat, and corn, and\r\nhave for years supplied the thousands of emigrants who traverse the\r\nTerritory en route to California. These Indians manufacture their\r\ncotton into blankets of fine texture and beautiful pattern, which\r\ncommand a high price. They also grind their corn and wheat, and make\r\nbread. In fact, the Pimos realize in their everyday life something of\r\nour ideas of Aztec civilization. A town will probably grow up just\r\nabove the Pimos villages, as there is a rich back country, and the\r\nstreams afford a valuable water power for running mills.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Santa Cruz traverses the territory from South to\r\nNorth, sinking near the town of Tueson, and probably finding its way to\r\nthe Gila, as a subterranean stream. This valley, of the richest land,\r\nis about one hundred miles long, in many places of great width, and has\r\non each side of it many rich valleys of limited extent, watered by\r\nstreams from the mountains, which flow into the Santa Cruz. The valleys\r\nand Ranches of Arivaca, Sopori, Calabazas, and Tueson, are those at\r\npresent most thickly settled. These produce all the fruits known to a\r\nSouthern clime--grapes, wheat, corn, and cotton in great abundance. The\r\nSan Pedro river and valley is also one of great richness, and is\r\nreported by Lieut. Parke as capable of sustaining a large population.\r\nThe Valle de Sauz, still farther East, more limited than the San Pedro\r\nor Santa Cruz, can be made available for a considerable population. The\r\nMimbres River also can, by a small outlay, be made to irrigate a large\r\nsurface and supply a moderate settlement. The various springs laid down\r\nby Gray, Emory, Parke, and Bartlett, will all afford water for small\r\nsettlements, and their supply can be much increased by a judicious\r\noutlay of money. The Rio Grande valley is very rich, and in places of\r\ngreat width. The Mesilla valley already contains a population of about\r\nfive thousand souls, and there is ample room for many more.\r\n\r\nIf, as proposed, the Northern boundary of the Arizona Territory should\r\nenclose the Northern branches of the Gila, an agricultural region will\r\nbe opened to settlement sufficient in itself to sustain the population\r\nof an immense agricultural State. Col. Bonneville, who is now at the\r\nhead of a large force exploring this region, writes to the Secretary of\r\nWar that it is the finest country he has ever seen, \"valleys capable of\r\nsustaining a population of twenty thousand each, teeming at every step\r\nwith evidences of an immense population long ago-and an ancient and\r\nsuperior civilization.\" The Hon. John R. Bartlett says of the\r\n\"Salinas,\" one of the Northern branches of the Gila, that it alone will\r\nsupply food for a great State. It must be recollected, in this\r\nconnection, that the great mineral wealth of Arizona will call for and\r\namply repay for the redemption and expensive cultivation of all the\r\navailable lands, and that irrigation produces immensely greater crops\r\nthan the other method of planting. Throughout the whole of Utah,\r\nirrigation has been resorted to with the greatest success. The soil in\r\nUtah, in no place that the writer saw it, could in any way be compared\r\nto that of the bottom lands of Arizona.\r\n\r\nCaptain Whipple in his valuable report of exploration for the Pacific\r\nRailroad, published by order of Congress, crossed the upper part of the\r\nregion alluded to, and which is watered by the Rio Verde and Salinas.\r\nHe fully sustains me in my remarks on those rich valleys.\r\n\r\n\"We are in the pleasantest region we have seen since leaving the\r\nChoctaw country. Here are clear rivulets, with fertile valleys and\r\nforest trees. The wide belt of country that borders the Black Forest,\r\nand probably extends along the Rio Verde to the Salinas and Gila, bears\r\nevery indication of being able to support a large agricultural and\r\npastoral population. The valley of the Rio Verde is magnificently\r\nwooded with furs and oaks, affording excellent timber. Ancient ruins\r\nare said by trappers to be scattered over its whole length to the\r\nconfluence with the Salinas. We, therefore, seem to have skirted the\r\nboundary of a country once populous, and worthy of becoming so again.\r\nBesides the advantages already enumerated, the mountains in this\r\nvicinity bear indications of mineral wealth. Vol. 3, p. 93.\"\r\n\r\nThe notes before referred to, in the possession of the writer, speak of\r\ngreat farming and grazing establishments scattered over the whole face\r\nof the Territory, between 1610 and 1800, which produced abundant crops\r\nof cereals, fruits, and grapes. These statements are confirmed by the\r\ntestimony of Major Emory and his report, where he enumerates several of\r\nthe most extensive--by Gray, Bartlett, Parke, and Col. Bonneville. Many\r\nof the Ranches, deserted by the Mexicans on account of the Apache\r\nIndians, have upon them large, well-built adobe houses which must have\r\ncost the builders thousands of dollars. Many of these have been\r\noccupied under squatter titles by emigrants within the last few years.\r\nOf others, only the ruins remain, having been destroyed by the\r\ndepredations of the Indians, or by the heavy rains of the succeeding\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of these lands on the Santa Cruz and San Pedro are\r\ncovered by Mexican titles--and many of these again by squatter claims.\r\nIt is absolutely necessary that Congress should by some wise and speedy\r\nlegislation settle, upon some definite basis, the land titles of\r\nArizona. Until this is done, disorder and anarchy will reign supreme\r\nover the country. The present condition of California is in a great\r\ndegree to be attributed to the want of any title to the most valuable\r\nreal property in the State, and the millions which have been spent in\r\nfruitless litigation should teach a lesson of great practical value.\r\nLet those Spanish grants and Mexican titles which have been occupied in\r\ngood faith be affirmed in the most expeditious and economical manner to\r\nthe claimants, and they will immediately pass into American hands, and\r\nbecome productive. The remainder of the country should then be thrown\r\nopen to settlers. No better code of mining law exists than the Spanish,\r\nadopted in the Senate bill introduced by the late General Rusk, and\r\npassed at the last session of Congress. A judicious and liberal\r\ndonation law, giving to the actual settler a homestead, and to the\r\nenterprising miner and \"prospector\" a fair security for the fruit of\r\nhis labors, will at once make of Arizona a popular, thriving and\r\nwealthy State, affording new markets for the productions of our\r\nAtlantic States, and yielding annually millions in silver and copper.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the produce of Arizona, the immediate vicinity of the\r\nagricultural region of Sonora affords an abundant market for all\r\nnecessary supplies, including sugar, which is manufactured by the\r\nMexicans in great quantities from the cane. Guyamas, which one day will\r\nbe ours, is one of the largest ports for the export of flour on the\r\nPacific coast north of Chili. She also exports several millions in\r\nsilver annually, which finds its way direct to the English market.\r\nUnder an intelligent system, the Sonora mines would yield a hundred\r\nmillions a year, and the supply is inexhaustible. If any reader doubts\r\nthis statement, refer him to the statistics of Humboldt, Ward, and\r\nWilson, most unquestioned and valuable authorities. Both Humboldt and\r\nWard note the fact that the silver deposites grow richer as they are\r\ntraced farther North. There can be no doubt that the most extensive and\r\nvaluable mines, both of pure silver and silver mixed with copper and\r\nlead, are within the limits of Arizona.\r\n\r\nThe yield of the silver mines of Mexico, as computed by Ward and\r\nHumboldt from the actual official returns to the Government, from the\r\nconquest to 1803, amounts to the enormous sum of $2,027,955,000, or\r\nmore than two BILLIONS Of dollars. Again, Ward says: \"I am aware that\r\nmany of the statements in this and the preceding books respecting the\r\nmineral riches of the North of New Spain, (Sonora, including the\r\n'Gadsden Purchase,' Chihuahua, and Durango,) will be thought\r\nexaggerated. THEY ARE NOT SO; they will be confirmed by every future\r\nreport, and in after years, the public, FAMILIARIZED WITH facts which\r\nare only questioned because they are new, will wonder at its present\r\nincredulity, and regret the loss of advantages which may not always be\r\nwithin its reach.\"\r\n\r\nOf the present mining operations in the Territory of Arizona, the most\r\nconsiderable, in point of labor performed and results, is \"The Arizona\r\nCopper Mining Co.\" This company is incorporated by the California\r\nLegislature, with a capital of one million of dollars. The President is\r\nMajor Robert Allen, U. S. A. The mines are old, and very celebrated in\r\nMexico under the name of El-Ajo. This company, at an expense of\r\n$100,000, have supplied their mines with an abundance of water,\r\nextracted several hundred tons of ore, and erected buildings, smelting\r\nfurnaces, and other appliances to facilitate their operations. They\r\nemploy about one hundred men, mostly Mexican miners. Their supplies of\r\nbreadstuffs and beef are obtained by contract from Sonora. These mines\r\nare situated one hundred and thirty miles from the mouth of the Gila\r\nRiver, and about sixty miles south of it. The ore varies in richness\r\nfrom thirty to sixty per cent, and the proceeds of some sales in London\r\nwere quoted as being the highest prices ever paid for ore in that\r\nmarket. A portion of this mine is owned by English capitalists, and it\r\nis without doubt one of the most valuable in the world. The profits may\r\nbe easily calculated, when it is known that the ore costs delivered in\r\nSwansea, England, not exceeding $125 per ton, and is worth from $200 to\r\n$375 per ton. Of course these profits will be greatly increased when\r\nthe company is in a position to smelt its ores at the mine. The Sonora\r\nExploring and Mining Company was organized in 1856, with a capital of\r\ntwo million dollars ($2,000,000). Its principal office is in\r\nCincinnati, Ohio, and its seat of operations at Tubac, in the Santa\r\nCruz valley. This company is managed in its mining operations by Chas.\r\nD. Poston, Esq., a gentleman of much experience on the Pacific coast,\r\nand of great energy of character.\r\n\r\nThe Rancho of Arivaca, containing several valuable silver mines, and\r\nseventeen thousand acres of valuable land, has been purchased by this\r\ncompany. It has also acquired the titles to a number of other valuable\r\nmines of galena ore, and copper containing silver and gold. Hitherto,\r\nthe exertions of the company have been directed principally to\r\nexplorations and cleaning out the old mines, but they have at present\r\nabove ground, ready for smelting, several thousand dollars worth of\r\ntheir ores. Prof. Booth, U. S. Assayer, as well as other distinguished\r\nauthorities, have, after thorough experiment, given to the company\r\ncertificates of the great richness of the ores already shipped to the\r\neast. The annual report of the Sonora Mining Co. is full of interest to\r\nthe general reader. The Sopori mine is another very valuable property.\r\nIt is owned by Messrs. Douglass, Aldrich, and another. Want of capital\r\nhas prevented the extensive development of this mine. It affords its\r\nproprietors a handsome profit, worked in the smallest and cheapest\r\nmanner. The vein is of great size, has been traced several rods in\r\nlength, and pays about one dollar to the pound of ore. The writer has\r\nexamined specimens from the \"Sopori,\" taken at random, and so rich is\r\nthe ore that the native silver can be cut out of it with a penknife, as\r\nout of a Mexican dollar. Undoubtedly the Sopori mine is destined to\r\nyield hundreds of millions. It is a peculiarity of the ores in this\r\ndistrict that they run near the surface, making mining of comparative\r\nsmall cost. The Sopori mine is surrounded by a fine country, well\r\nwatered and wooded. The \"Gadsonia Copper Mining Co.,\" after taking out\r\na few tons of exceedingly rich ore--averaging over eighty per\r\ncent.--was obliged to suspend operations on account of the cost of\r\ntransportation. When the Territory shall be organized and capital\r\nprotected by law, these mines will be worked to advantage. \"The Gila\r\nRiver Copper Mines\" are more favorably situated than any other yet\r\nopened, being directly on the Gila River, only twenty-five miles from\r\nits mouth. The ores can be taken from the mine, immediately shipped\r\nupon flat boats or a light draft steamer, and transported down the\r\nColorado River to the head of the Gulf of California, when they can be\r\ntranshipped to England at small cost. Upwards of twenty veins of copper\r\nore have been opened, and the assays give results varying from 30 to 70\r\nper cent. These mines are owned by Messrs. Hooper, Hinton, Halstead,\r\nand another. Several thousand dollars have been already expended in\r\nprospecting and opening veins, and it was anticipated by the\r\nproprietors that the first cargo would be shipped to Swansea, England,\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\nSmelting works will eventually be built at the mines, or at Colorado\r\nCity, opposite Fort Yuma, and the profits of this company must be very\r\ngreat. The vicinity of the Colorado, and the abundance of wood and\r\nwater, give the proprietors facilities for conducting their operations\r\nat small cost.\r\n\r\nSilver mining is also carried on in the vicinity of Mesilla Valley, and\r\nnear the Rio Grande. Many other mining operations are constantly being\r\ncommenced; but the depredations of the Apache Indians have almost\r\nentirely snatched success from the hard-working miner, who, besides\r\nlosing his all, is often massacred in some ferocious manner.\r\n\r\nNo protection, either civil or military, is extended over the greater\r\nportion of Arizona. This checks the development of all her\r\nresources--not only to her own injury, but that of California and the\r\nAtlantic States--by withholding a market for their productions, and the\r\nbullion which she is fully able to supply to an extent corresponding to\r\nthe labor employed in obtaining it.\r\n\r\nA. B. Gray, Esq., late U. S. Surveyor under the treaty of Guadalupe\r\nHidalgo, for running the Mexican Boundary, and subsequently Exploring\r\nEngineer and Surveyor of the Southern Pacific Railroad, has probably\r\nseen more of the proposed Territory of Arizona than any other person,\r\nhis statements in reference to that region, embodied in a report to the\r\nHon., the Secretary of the Interior, from actual field reconnoissances\r\nsix years ago, will be read with much interest, particularly as since\r\nthen, repeated developments in that country have proved the correctness\r\nof his judgment; his opinions are, therefore, of much importance, as\r\nexpressed in his able report. It will be recollected that this was then\r\nMexican Territory. Colonel Gray says:\r\n\r\n\"The public, I think have been misled by misrepresentations made in\r\nregard to the resources of the region of country lying along the Gila\r\nand upon the line proposed for a railroad at or near the parallel of 32\r\ndegrees north latitude. That portion of country east of the Rio Grande\r\nI can say but little of from personal observation, having been over but\r\napart of the ground near the eastern division in Texas, and that in the\r\nvicinity of El Paso. At both these points, however, a fine country\r\nexists. Upon the Gila river grows cotton of the most superior kind. Its\r\nnature is not unlike that of the celebrated Sea Island cotton,\r\npossessing an equally fine texture, and, if anything, more of a silky\r\nfibre. The samples I procured at the Indian villages, from the rudely\r\ncultivated fields of the Pimas and Maricopas, have been spoken of as an\r\nextraordinary quality. Wheat, corn, and tobacco, together with beans,\r\nmelons, etc., grow likewise upon the banks and in the valleys bordering\r\nthe Gila and its tributaries. The sugar cane, too, I believe, will be\r\nfound to thrive in this section of the country west of the Rio San\r\nPedro. A sort of candied preserve and molasses, expressed from the\r\nfruit of the cereus giganteus and agave Americana was found by our\r\nparty in 1851, as we passed through the Pinal Llano camps and among the\r\nGila tribes, to be most acceptable. The candied preserve was a most\r\nexcellent substitute for sugar. It is true that there are extensive\r\nwastes to be encountered west of the Rio Grande, yet they are not\r\ndeserts of sand, but plains covered at certain seasons of the year with\r\nluxuriant grass, exhibiting green spots and springs not very remote\r\nfrom each other at all times. There is sufficient water in the Gila and\r\nits branches for all the purposes of irrigation when it is wanted, the\r\nstreams being high during the season most needed. The Rio Salado, a\r\ntributary of the Gila, is a bold and far more beautiful river than the\r\nGila itself, and, from the old ruins now seen there, must have had\r\nformerly a large settlement upon its banks. \"To many persons merely\r\ntravelling or emigrating across the country, with but one object in\r\nview, and that the reaching their destination on the Pacific, the\r\ncountry would generally present a barren aspect. But it will be\r\nrecollected that the most productive fields in California, before\r\nAmerican enterprise introduced the plough, and a different mode of\r\ncultivation from that of the natives of the country, presented somewhat\r\nsimilar appearance. Many believed, at first, from the cold and sterile\r\nlook of the hills, and the parched appearance of the fields and\r\nvalleys, over which the starving coyote is often seen prowling in\r\nsearch of something to subsist on, that California could never become\r\nan agricultural district, but must depend upon her other  resources for\r\ngreatness, and trust to distant regions for the necessaries of life\r\nrequired for her increased population. It was natural enough, too, that\r\nthis impression should be created in those accustomed to a different\r\nState of things, and particularly when it is considered that the very\r\nseason of blossom and bloom of our Atlantic States was the winter of\r\nCalifornia; but these same fields and hills have a very different\r\nappearance in January, February, and March, clothed as they are in the\r\nbrightest verdure and no one now will pretend to say that California\r\ndoes not possess within herself great agricultural as well as mineral\r\nwealth. This, I believe, will some day be the case with the country\r\nfrom the Rio Grande to the Gulf of California, adjacent to the Gila.\r\nSenate Ex. Doc. No. 55, 33rd Congress, 2nd Session.\"\r\n\r\n * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the resources of this region for a railroad, in the same\r\nreport, Gray says:\r\n\r\n\"The valley of Mesilla, extending from about twelve miles above the\r\ntrue boundary of the treaty to the parallel of 32 degrees 22 minutes\r\nnorth latitude, lies wholly within the disputed district, and is, for\r\nits extent, one of the most beautiful and fertile along the whole\r\ncourse of the Rio Grande. The town of Mesilla, only a few years old,\r\ncontains several thousand people, and is a prosperous little place. It\r\nwas not settled until after the cession of this territory to us by the\r\ntreaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Portions of the valley are highly\r\ncultivated, and produce the grains and fruits of our most thriving\r\nStates. In connexion with the land on the east side of the river, the\r\nvalley of the Messilla is capable of sustaining a considerable\r\npopulation. It is situated centrally with regard to a large district of\r\ncountry of lesser agricultural capacity. The section of the Rio Grande\r\nin the vicinity of El Paso and the valley of Mesilla, is proverbial for\r\nthe production of fine vegetables and fruits. Indeed, about El Paso, it\r\nis a complete garden with flourishing vineyards, equalling in\r\nexcellence those of the most celebrated grape growing countries.\r\n\r\n\"By a judicious disposition of military stations along this line, only\r\na few troops would be required to protect the great northern frontier\r\nof Sonora and Chihuahua, and enable us to carry out the 11th article of\r\nour late treaty with Mexico more effectually, and at the same time\r\nprevent any depredations which the Indians might be disposed to commit\r\non the road. Soon after, the settlement of the country would make the\r\npresence of the military unnecessary, either for the safety of a\r\nrailway of the security of the frontier. The strong holds of the\r\nApaches, and their pathway to Mexico, would be cut off.\r\n\r\n\"A wagon road established from the Gulf of California would enable\r\nsupplies to be transported along this line at one-half of the present\r\ncost. The saving of one-third or more distance, through a comparatively\r\nunsettled country, in transportation is an important consideration in\r\nthe construction of a railway, more especially when men and materials,\r\nto a great extent, must be brought from very remote points. The\r\nnavigation of the Gulf of California is said to be very good. The\r\ntrade-winds from the northwest, encountering the highlands of the\r\npeninsula of Lower California, and forming a counter current under its\r\nlee, enable sailing vessels to proceed advantageously along that coast.\r\nReturning, by keeping on the eastern aide, or along the shore of\r\nSonora, they could avail themselves of the prevailing winds, which\r\nregain their usual direction after sweeping across the wide expanse of\r\nwater. The trade of the Gulf, with its pearl fisheries and other\r\nresources, would be speedily developed.\r\n\r\n * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n\"The advantages of such a thoroughfare are obvious. Five years would\r\nhardly elapse before inestimable benefits would be realized; and,\r\nshould war threaten our Pacific possessions, a few days would suffice\r\nto send from the Mississippi valley an army that would defy any force\r\nthat the most formidable power could array against us. The fine cotton\r\nregion of the Gila, the rich copper, silver, and gold mines of New\r\nMexico and Sonora would be at once developed, bringing a vast district\r\nof country into cultivation which now presents a fruitless waste, owing\r\nto Indian depredations and the absence of means of communication and\r\nprotection. Mexico has tried for a century past to insure safety to her\r\ninhabitants in this region, but notwithstanding the expense she has\r\nincurred in keeping up her garrisons, she has failed to afford them\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n\"The deserted appearance of the country from El Paso to the Colorado is\r\nno criterion by which to judge of its value. The beautiful valley of\r\nSan Xavier, or Santa Cruz, some two years ago when I passed through it,\r\nwas entirely deserted. The once thriving towns of Tumacacori and Tubac\r\nhad not the sign of a living soul about them except the recent moccasin\r\ntrack of the Apaches. The orchards and vineyards of the once highly\r\ncultivated fields and gardens bore the marks of gradual decay and\r\ndestruction. The ranchos of Calabazas, of San Bernardino, and numerous\r\nother places on this frontier, presented the same melancholy aspect,\r\nthe result of the inability of Mexico to protect this portion of\r\nterritory from the inroads of the savages. There are now but a few\r\nsettlements throughout this district of country, but were it protected\r\nby a power that could and would defend it, what is now a waste in the\r\nhands of the savages might become a thriving country, with safety\r\ninsured to its inhabitants.\" Senate Ex. Doc. No. 55, 33rd Congress, 2nd\r\nSess.\r\n\r\nI quote the following language of Gray, from subsequent explorations\r\nmade by him, three years after his first expedition, and contained in\r\nhis report to the Southern Pacific Railroad Company. It was chiefly\r\nfrom the discoveries made by Gray, in this adventurous expedition,\r\nthrough regions unknown for many years past, between the Rio Grande and\r\nGulf of California, together with the Gadsden Treaty, that induced\r\nparties at great expense to emigrate there, and commence working the\r\nvast mineral deposites, such as the Arabac silver mines, the Ajo copper\r\nmountain, and others, but which, through lack of proper protection and\r\nmeans of communication, have been greatly retarded in their development.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the dividing ridge of the continent west of the Rio\r\nGrande, Gray thus alludes to the country:\r\n\r\n\"There were large haciendas and fine cattle ranches in this\r\nneighborhood, until a war of extermination was declared by the Apaches\r\nagainst the Mexicans. Remains of the old San Pedro ranch are seen at\r\nthis day; also the \"Tres Alamos;\" and the ruins of the hacienda of\r\nBabacomeri, whose walls and towers are still standing. These were among\r\nthe wealthiest of Sonora in horses, cattle, sheep, etc., but it has\r\nbeen many years since. It is a fine grazing region, with wild cattle\r\nand mustangs constantly seen roaming over the plains. The district from\r\nSan Pedro to Santa Cruz valley, nearly due west from our present\r\ncrossing (latitude 31 degrees 34 minutes), will be to the Pacific slope\r\nwhat the region of Fort Chadbourne, in Texas, will be to the Atlantic.\r\nThe mountains and hills are covered with splendid timber of the largest\r\nsize, and for all purposes; and the valleys are full of springs, and\r\nthe finest grass. To Tubac, a town in the valley of Santa Cruz, it is\r\n69 miles. This is by following the San Pedro about a league, passing\r\nover a few insignificant spurs, and ascending the Rio Babacomeri;\r\nthence continuing westward by a gradual rise over delightful plains to\r\nthe divide between that and the Sonoita or Clover creek, and along the\r\nlatter, until it loses itself in the porous earth, a mile from the\r\nSanta Cruz river, and by the broad valley of that stream to Tubac.\"\r\n\r\n * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nOf the line of Gray's exploration from the Rio San Pedro, he says:\r\n\r\n\"It passes through the most desirable region, with the hills and\r\nmountains for forty miles, containing inexhaustible quantities of\r\ntimber. We noticed tall cedar and oaks of every description; one kind\r\nmore interesting than the others, being a white oak from twenty to\r\nforty feet in the body. Pine and spruce, with superior white ash and\r\nwalnut, were found, and the most gigantic cotton-woods, particularly on\r\nthe Sonoita. * * * * \"The mountains in the neighborhood are filled with\r\nminerals, and the precious metals are said to abound. The famous\r\nPlanchas de Plata and Arizona silver mines, which the Count Raouset de\r\nBoulbon attempted to take possession of, are in this section of\r\ncountry, not many miles below the present limits, and at several of the\r\nold ranchos and deserted mining villages which we visited, were found\r\nthe argentiferous galena ore and gold. The Sierra Santa Rita runs along\r\nto the east of the Santa Cruz valley, and forms a part of this\r\ninteresting region. It is very high and bold, filled with fertile\r\nvalleys and flowing rivulets, and covered with a dense growth of\r\ntimber. I saw much of this district, when here in 1851, on the survey\r\nof the boundary.\"\r\n\r\n * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe country bordering immediately the head of the Gulf of California,\r\nthrough which Gray was probably the first to penetrate, lies adjacent\r\nto the proposed Arizona Territory, but not a part of the same, being a\r\nportion of the State of Sonora. He thus describes that section:\r\n\r\n\"The Indians represent rich Placers existing throughout this region,\r\nand large numbers of them had lately come in with considerable\r\nquantities of the dust. They were trading it for trifles to the\r\nMexicans. I got some specimens of it which was the same as the\r\nCalifornia Gold. This was not the time of year (June) for them to work\r\nthe mines, but in the fall, after the rain has commenced. The greatest\r\ndrawback to the profitable working of the Placers of this district, is\r\nthe scarcity of water. If artesian wells succeed, there is little doubt\r\nthat it will create an important change. West from Tuseon and Tubac,\r\ntowards the Gulf of California, the country presents more the\r\nappearance of a barren waste or desert than any district I have seen.\r\nIt nevertheless has occasional oases, with fine grazing lands about\r\nthem, and the mountains, which are more broken and detached, have\r\ndistinct marks of volcanic origin. The ranges though short, have\r\ngenerally the same parallel direction as those further east. It is the\r\ncountry of the Papago Indians, a peaceful and friendly tribe, extending\r\ndown to the Gulf coast, where they are mixed up somewhat with the\r\nCocopas of the Colorado. From Sonoita I explored to the Gulf shore,\r\nnear the mouth of Adair Bay. It was 62 miles, following a dry arroya\r\nmost of the way, and the point at which I struck the Gulf was in\r\nlatitude 31 degrees 36 minutes 34 minutes. The \"Bay\" is about 15 miles\r\nacross, and from all I could learn, 15 miles long, and represented as\r\nhaving four fathoms of water. It is completely encircled by a range of\r\nsand hills, reaching north-west to the Colorado river and south-east as\r\nfar as the eye could discover. These \"sables\" are probably eighty or\r\nninety miles in extent, by five to ten broad.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding it appears to be the most desolate and forlorn-looking\r\nspot for eighty miles around the head of the Gulf, the sand hills\r\nlooking like a terrible desert, nature seems even here, where no rain\r\nhad fallen for eight months, to have provided for the sustenance of\r\nman, one of the most nutritious and palatable vegetables.\r\n\r\n\"East of the Tinaja Alta or high tank range, lie the famous Sierras del\r\nAjo, now United States territory. These mountains derive their name\r\nfrom the vast deposits of red oxide and green carbonate of copper found\r\nabout them, and which the Indians have made use of to paint (ajo)\r\nthemselves with. The mines are unquestionably of great value, and must\r\nbecome important, more particularly from their being situated in the\r\nneighborhood of the contemplated railway. The tall Cereus Giganteus and\r\nAgave Americana are found in abundance. From the latter plant the\r\nnatives make the pulque, mezcal and agua-diente; and the petahaya or\r\ncereus, produces a fruit from which is made a very pleasant preserve.\r\nAt the Pimo and Maricopa villages are found wheat, corn, tobaco, and\r\ncotton, besides melons, pumpkins, beans, etc. The nature of the soil\r\nfor great distances in the Gila valley is of a reddish loam; some parts\r\ncoated with a beautiful crystallization of salt, a quarter to half an\r\ninch thick. This seems to be more particularly the case below the\r\nMaricopa villages and toward the Rio Salado. The cotton, of which I\r\nprocured specimens, though cultivated by the Indians in the most\r\nprimitive manner, exhibited a texture not unlike the celebrated Sea\r\nIsland cotton. Its fibre is exceedingly soft and silky, but not of the\r\nlongest staple. Large tracts of land on the Gila and in other portions\r\nof this district, appear to possess the same properties of soil; and\r\nwhere, I have no doubt, the finest cotton will soon be extensively\r\nraised and brought to its highest state of perfection by proper\r\ncultivation.\"\r\n\r\nThe climate is thus referred to by Gray:\r\n\r\n\"One of the most favorable features upon the route in the vicinity of\r\nthe 32nd degree proposed for the Pacific railway is, its accessibility\r\nat all times, admitting of labor being performed in the open air at\r\neach season. The nature of the climate through Texas to the Rio Grande\r\nhas already been referred to, and from thence to the Santa Cruz valley\r\nhalf way to the Colorado, over the elevated plateau of the Sierra\r\nMadra, it is equally salubrious and temperate. The rainy season falls\r\nin the summer months, and but seldom is snow seen even upon the\r\nmountain tops. Towards the Colorado river it is much drier and more\r\ntorrid, but by no means unhealthy; nor does it prevent out door work\r\nthe whole of the day during the heated term of summer.\r\n\r\n\"The great riches of the country, however, are a total waste at the\r\npresent time, but which the Pacific railroad will at once develop, and\r\nmake to itself the foundation of a vast revenue. I refer to its\r\nmetallic wealth, the silver, gold, and copper mines that abound in\r\nalmost every mountain and valley, between the Rio Grande and the Gulf\r\nof California.\r\n\r\n\"The ores of Chihuahua and Sonora [now Arizona. S. M.] are chiefly\r\nsulphuret (lead or iron), or native silver in porphyritic or stratified\r\nlimestone rocks passing at greater depths into igneous rocks. From\r\nloose piles lying upon the surface and evidently picked over, I\r\nprocured specimens of silver and copper. Three samples representing\r\npoints on the line of our exploration about equi-distant from each\r\nother, viz.: the Rio Grande, the neighborhood of Tubac, and within 90\r\nmiles of the junction of the Gila and Colorado rivers, were submitted\r\nto Dr. I. K. Chilton, of New York, for analysis. He found in one sample\r\nof lead ore (argentiferous galena), by fire assay 71 per cent. of lead,\r\nand the \"LEAD YIELDED SILVER EQUIVALENT to 128 ounces, 1 dwt. to the\r\nton\" (of 2000 pounds).\r\n\r\n\"In another, he found the lead obtained from it to yield silver in the\r\nproportion of 72 ounces 5 dwts. to the ton or 2000 pounds.\r\n\r\n\"The copper specimen was the red oxide, and yielded as follows:\r\n\r\n  Copper,............  71.80\r\n  Iron,..............   7.84\r\n  Oxygen,............  12.34\r\n  Silicia, Alumina,..   8.02\r\n                      ------\r\n                      100 parts.\r\n\r\n\"The Papagos and Pimas Indians, by proper management, might be made\r\nvery useful, in working upon the road where there is not much rock\r\nexcavation. They are unlike the Indians of Texas, or the Apaches,\r\nliving in villages and cultivating the soil, besides manufacturing\r\nblankets, baskets, pottery, etc. Quiet and peaceable, they have no\r\nfears except from their enemies, the Apaches, and are very industrious,\r\nmuch more so than the lower order of Mexicans, and live far more\r\ncomfortably. It is astonishing with what precision they construct their\r\nacequias--irrigating canals--some of them, the acequias madre, of very\r\nlarge size, and without the use of levelling apparatus, but simply by\r\nthe eye. Their gardens and farms too are regularly ditched and fenced\r\noff into rectangles and circles, with hedges and trees planted as if\r\ndone by more enlightened people.\"\r\n\r\nThe population of the new Territory of Arizona is at present not far\r\nfrom eight thousand, and is rapidly increasing. The Mesilla Valley and\r\nthe Rio Grande are probably the most thickly populated, containing\r\nabout five thousand people. A majority of the Mesilla inhabitants are\r\nMexicans, but they will be controlled by the American residents, whose\r\nnumber and influence is constantly on the increase. The Santa Cruz\r\nValley, in which are situated the towns of Tueson, Tubac, Tumacacari,\r\nand the mining settlement of Sopori and others, is, next to Mesilla,\r\nthe most thickly settled. Tueson was formerly a town of three thousand\r\ninhabitants; but the majority have been driven off by the Apache\r\nIndians. It is fast becoming a thriving American town, and will before\r\nlong be a place of more importance than ever before. Real estate is\r\nalready held at high rates, and the erection of buildings shows that\r\nAmerican energy is about to change the face of the last half century.\r\nTubac had been completely deserted by the Mexicans. It has been\r\nreoccupied by the Sonora Exploring and Mining Company, and now boasts a\r\npopulation of several hundred. The Calabazas valley is also fast\r\nfilling up with an American population, and another year will see the\r\nwhole centre of the Territory dotted with settlements. Many of the fine\r\nclaims on the San Pedro River have already been located by emigrants\r\nunder the general pre-emption law, but until protection is afforded to\r\nthe settlers, but little progress will be made in agricultural\r\npursuits. The Apache Indian regards the soil as his own, and having\r\nexpelled the Spanish and Mexican invader, he feels little inclination\r\nto submit to the American. A small settlement of Americans is growing\r\nup at Colorado city, opposite Fort Yuma, at the junction of the Gila\r\nand Colorado rivers. This point is destined to be one of great\r\ncommercial and pecuniary importance. Situated at the present head of\r\nnavigation, at the point where the overland mail route crosses the\r\nColorado, and where the Southern Pacific Railroad must bridge the\r\nstream, it is a necessary stopping place for all travel across the\r\ncountry. Here are transhipped all the ores coming from the Territory,\r\nwhich find their way to market down the Colorado to the Gulf of\r\nCalifornia, thence by steamer or sailing vessel to their destination.\r\nHere all supplies of merchandise for the Territory are landed, and from\r\nthis point forwarded to their various owners. A thriving commerce has\r\nalready sprung up between Arizona and San Francisco. In almost any\r\ndaily paper in San Francisco may be seen vessels advertised for the\r\nmouth of the Colorado. Two steamers find active employment in\r\ntransporting government stores from the head of the Gulf of California\r\nto Fort Yuma, and goods to Colorado city for the merchants of Tueson,\r\nTubac, Calabazas, and for the mining companies. Should the exploration\r\nof the Upper Colorado by Lieutenant Ives, United States Army, now in\r\nprogress, prove successful, Colorado city will become still more\r\nimportant, as the surplus products of the rich valleys of New Mexico,\r\nUtah, and California to the north, will all find a market down the\r\nColorado. Property in this new city is held at high rates, and by the\r\nlast San Francisco News Letter is quoted at an advance. The population\r\nof Arizona Territory has much increased within a few months by\r\nemigration from California. The massacre of Henry A. Crabbe and his\r\nparty by the Mexicans at Cavorca created a desire for revenge\r\nthroughout all California. Companies have been formed, and large\r\nparties are settling in Arizona, near the Mexican line, with the\r\nulterior object of overrunning Sonora, and revenging the tragedy in\r\nwhich was shed some of the best blood of the State. The appropriation\r\nby the last Congress of two hundred thousand dollars for the\r\nconstruction of a wagon road from El Paso to Fort Yuma, and the two\r\nmail contracts, semi-monthly and semi-weekly, which involve an\r\nexpenditure of nine hundred thousand dollars per annum, will afford\r\nemployment to a host of people, and draw at once to the neighborhood of\r\nthe route an active and energetic population. The new wagon and mail\r\nroute traverses the Territory of Arizona throughout its entire length.\r\nAlong the mail route, at intervals, military posts will be established.\r\nThese and the necessary grazing stations will create points around\r\nwhich settlements will at once grow up, and the country, now bare, will\r\nshow everywhere thriving villages. The Southern Pacific Railroad, which\r\nwill be built because it is necessary to the country, will find its way\r\neasily through Arizona.\r\n\r\nIt is no exaggeration to say that the mining companies, in their own\r\ninterest, will be forced to subscribe enough to the stock of the\r\ncompany to insure its success. The Arizona Copper Mining Company is now\r\npaying $100 per ton for the transportation of its ores from the mines\r\nto Colorado city. One year's freight money at this rate would build\r\nmany miles of the road. The silver mining companies will be only too\r\nglad to get their ores to market at so cheap a rate, as their\r\nproportion of the subscription to the railroad. Iron and coal are both\r\nfound in the Territory,--the former especially in great abundance.\r\nTexas has guaranteed the road to El Paso, by her generous legislation;\r\nArizona will build it, with her mineral wealth, to Fort Yuma, the\r\neastern boundary of California, and California will do the rest. The\r\nfirst terminus of the Southern Pacific Railroad will doubt less be on\r\nthe Gulf of California, at the Island of Tiburon, or more probably\r\nGuyamas. A steam ferry across the Gulf, a short railroad across the\r\npeninsula of Lower California to a secure harbor on the Pacific, (where\r\na steamer will take passengers and freight in four days to San\r\nFrancisco,) is the most natural course of this route. In view of this\r\nprobability, all the available points for such a terminus on the Gulf\r\nhave been, or are in progress of being, secured by capitalists, either\r\nby obtaining grants from the Mexican Government, or by purchase from\r\nprivate individuals. Already Guyamas is owned in great part by English\r\nand American capitalists. A port on the Gulf of California is necessary\r\nto our Pacific possessions, and must be ours sooner or later. The\r\nlonger it is delayed, the worse for American progress on the Pacific.\r\nArizona needs it at once, as a depot for the export of her ores, and\r\nfor the import of goods for the supply of her population.\r\n\r\nThe Mormon war has closed for years the great emigrant road to\r\nCalifornia and Oregon, over the South Pass and Salt Lake valley,\r\nleaving open only the route along the 32d parallel of latitude, through\r\nArizona. This route is by far the most practicable at all seasons of\r\nthe year, and the closing of the South Pass route by the Mormon\r\ndifficulty is an additional and urgent argument in favor of the early\r\norganization of this Territory. Fifty thousand souls will move towards\r\nthe Pacific early in the spring, if the route is opened to a secure\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of Arizona Territory is deplorable in the\r\nextreme. Throughout the whole country there is no redress for crimes or\r\ncivil injuries--no courts, no law, no magistrates. The Territory of New\r\nMexico, to which it is attached by an act of Congress, affords it\r\nneither protection nor sustenance. The following extracts from letters\r\nreceived by the writer tell the story of the necessity for early action\r\non the part of Congress, in urgent terms.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUBAC, GADSDEN PURCHASE, August 15, 1857.\r\n\r\nAffairs in the Territory have not improved. A party of Americans (our\r\ncountrymen) had made an \"excursion\" into Sonora, captured a train of\r\nmules, and killed several Mexicans. Upon their return to the Territory\r\nwith their ill-gotten booty, the citizens formed a company and took the\r\nproperty away from them, and returned it to the owners in Magdalena, [a\r\ntown of Sonora--Ed.] and delivered the robbers up to Major Steen,\r\ncommanding first dragoons, to be held in custody until Courts should be\r\norganized. They have again been turned loose upon the community. In\r\njustice to Major Fitzgerald I must say he was in favor of retaining\r\nthem in custody, and has generally maintained favoring law and order in\r\nthe Territory, but as he is only second in command he has no absolute\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nWe have no remedy but to follow the example so wide spread in the\r\nUnion, and form a \"Vigilance Committee\"--contrary to all good morals,\r\nlaw, order, and society. Can you do nothing to induce the government to\r\nestablish authority and law in this country, and avert this unhappy\r\nalternative?\r\n\r\nIt is not desired by any good citizens, and tends to anarchy and\r\nmobocracy, causing disloyalty in our own citizens and bringing the\r\nreproach of foreigners upon our republican institutions. It is\r\nimpossible to progress in developing the resources of the country under\r\nthis state of affairs. The greatest objection the capitalists of San\r\nFrancisco have to aiding me in the development of silver mines, is the\r\ninsecurity of property, want of protection from government, and general\r\ndistrust of fair and honest legislation.\r\n\r\nThey have no confidence that the guarantees of the GADSDEN TREATY will\r\nbe respected by the United States, in regard to land titles under the\r\nMexican government.\r\n\r\nThe silver ore brought to San Francisco from our mines, has been tested\r\nby a dozen different officers, in as many different ways, and no result\r\nfalls BELOW FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER TON OF ORE.\r\n\r\nSenator Gwin goes on to Washington soon, and will corroborate my\r\nstatements. He has a piece of the silver, the first smelted in San\r\nFrancisco, showing $8,735 20--EIGHT THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND\r\nTHIRTY-FIVE 20-100 DOLLARS PER TON OF ORE. Mr. Dunbar is getting the\r\npetition to Congress signed--and moving in the affairs of the Territory\r\nin connection with Mr. Ehrenberg and our friends--but the government\r\ncame near \"crushing us out\" by sending a Custom House Collector to\r\nconsume and destroy what little we had saved from the Apaches. Can\r\nnothing be done to rid us of a Custom House? It is no protection. The\r\nTerritory (as yet) produces nothing but minerals--and we have to pay\r\nduty upon every article of consumption. This is a very onerous tax upon\r\nour first feeble efforts to develop the resources of this remote and\r\nunprotected country.\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n  C. D. Poston.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Lieut. Mowry, U. S. A., Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n\"We are living without the protection of law or the ameliorations of\r\nsociety. New Mexico affords us no protection. We have not even received\r\nan order for election. Every one goes armed to the teeth, and a\r\ndifficulty is sure to prove fatal. In this state of affairs it is\r\nimpossible to hold a convention.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTueson, Oct. 1, 1857.\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to hear that the prospect for Arizona is so bright. If\r\nyou should succeed in getting a separate organization for Arizona, you\r\nwill lay the people under many obligations to you. You have no doubt\r\nreceived many petitions for Congress, and also your certificate of\r\nelection as delegate for this purchase. You received the entire vote;\r\nthere was no difference of opinion among the voters.\r\n\r\nYour ob't serv't,\r\n  J. A. Douglas.\r\n\r\n\r\nLt. Mowry, U. S. A.\r\n  Tucson, Oct. 25, 1857.\r\n\r\nI send you the last petition from the Territory. The work is now in\r\nyour hands, and we say, God speed it.\r\n\r\nG. H. Oury.\r\n\r\n\r\nTueson, Arizona Territory, Oct. 17, 1857.\r\n\r\nEvery thing begins to look up in the Territory notwithstanding the\r\ndifficulties we labor under. The Indians the other day came within\r\neight hundred yards of Fort Buchanan and remained some time, and when\r\nthey left carried off with them all the horses and mules in the valley\r\nfor six or eight miles below. Try your hand in this matter of our\r\nTerritory, and see if some change cannot be wrought to some benefit--we\r\nneed it greatly.\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n  G. H. Oury.\r\n\r\n\r\nTueson, Oct. 2, 1857.\r\n\r\nWe have heard from Mesilla and they fully concur with us in all we have\r\ndone, showing that you are the person chosen to act for them and to\r\nrepresent their interest in this matter. The people here are very much\r\nelated at the turn things are taking, and every one seems to be highly\r\npleased with the course you have pursued. An election was held on the\r\nfirst Monday in September, at which you received all the votes given,\r\nand a certificate of your election, signed by the judges and clerks,\r\nhas been forwarded to you. The country is being settled very fast, and\r\nthere is somewhat of a stir to obtain cultivated lands. The lands\r\nalready under cultivation are now fifty per cent. higher than a short\r\ntime back. The great misfortune we labor under is want of protection.\r\nThousands and thousands of acres of land, as rich and fertile as any on\r\nthe face of the globe, lie idle and useless because they are not\r\nprotected from the Apaches. We want only one thing besides the\r\nTerritorial organization, and that is PROTECTION.\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n  S. Warner.\r\n\r\n\r\nOct. 8, 1857.\r\n\r\nThe guerilla warfare on the Sonora frontier continues with increased\r\naggravation. We look for the happiest result from the exploration of\r\nthis interesting region of the Colorado, about to be explored by Lieut.\r\nIves, U. S. A. The ores from the Heintzelman mine took the premium at\r\nthe mechanics' fair in San Francisco, just closed, where the ores from\r\nCalifornia and the western coast were on exhibition. So, Arizona leads\r\nCalifornia, the great mineral State.\r\n\r\nAll we need is good government and honest, liberal legislation to make\r\nArizona equal in production of precious metals, if not exceed,\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n  C. D. Poston.\r\n\r\n\r\nLt. Mowry, U. S. A.\r\n  Fort Yuma, June 2, 1857.\r\n\r\nNews has just come in from the Arizona which represent an awful state\r\nof affairs. During the time Mr. Belknap was below at Sonora it was\r\nunsafe for him to go out unless accompanied by his friend, Don\r\nGaudaloupe Orosco, and even then it was very dangerous. No news from\r\nSonora nor even an arrival for the last twenty days. God knows what is\r\ngoing on; though of one thing we are certain--no American, never mind\r\nwhatsoever he may be, can go into Sonora, with or without a passport.\r\n\r\nVery sincerely yours,\r\n  P. R. Brady.\r\n\r\n\r\nAug. 5, 1850.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the purchase has been extremely bad since the\r\nunfortunate and injudicious expedition of Crabbe into Sonora, and at\r\nthe present time is but little better than a field of guerilla warfare,\r\nrobbery and plunder.\r\n\r\nThe exasperated state of feeling between the Mexicans and Americans\r\nprevents intercourse and commerce, upon which the Territory is\r\ndependent. Americans are afraid to venture into Sonora for supplies,\r\nand Mexicans afraid to venture over the line. Americans who had nothing\r\nto do with the fillibustering invasion have been treated badly in\r\nSonora and driven out of the country, and Mexicans coming into the\r\npurchase with supplies and animals have been robbed and plundered by\r\nthe returned fillibusters.\r\n\r\nThe Americans in the Territory are by no means harmonious on these\r\nsubjects--some in favor of filibustering and others opposed to it; some\r\nin favor of murdering and robbing Mexicans wherever found, and others\r\nopposed to it.\r\n\r\nIt results that we are in a state of anarchy, and there is no\r\ngovernment, no protection to life, property, or business; no law and no\r\nself-respect or morality among the people. We are living in a perfect\r\nstate of nature, without the restraining influence of civil or military\r\nlaw, or the amelioration of society.\r\n\r\nThere have not been many conflicts and murders, because every man goes\r\narmed to the teeth, and a difficulty is always fatal on one side or the\r\nother. In the midst of all this, the Government has blessed us with a\r\ncustom house at Calabazos to collect duties upon the necessaries of\r\nlife which, by chance and \"running the gauntlet,\" we may get from\r\nSonora.\r\n\r\nGod send that we had been left alone with the Apaches. We should have\r\nbeen a thousand times better off in every respect.\r\n\r\nIn this state of affairs it is scarcely to be expected that the people\r\nwill meet together in a convention; there was no arrangement for that\r\npurpose up to the time of my leaving, and none could be made.\r\n\r\nWe have never had any orders of election from Santa Fe, nor heard of\r\nany convention.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n  C. D. Poston.\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor Fitzgerald, U. S. A., whose long experience on the Pacific coast\r\nmakes his opinion very valuable, in a letter dated Fort Buchanan,\r\nArizona, Sept. 17th, 1854, says:\r\n\r\n\"The citizens of this country are very desirous of a territorial\r\norganization, with its courts, &c. Murders are committed and stock is\r\nstolen by white men with impunity. There is no court nearer than the\r\nRio Grande (300 miles) to take cognizance of crime. Some few of the\r\nemigrants of this year have remained in the Santa Cruz valley. More\r\nwould have done so, no doubt, if they had not started from the States\r\noriginally with stock for the California market.\r\n\r\nThe country around us is now beautiful. It has been raining almost\r\ndaily since the 1st of July, and the vegetation is most luxuriant. Many\r\nof the Mexican citizens come over the line for purposes of trade,\r\nbringing flour, fruit, and leather. If there was no custom house at\r\nCalabazas, these articles could be had very cheaply.\r\n\r\nWe have very excellent gardens, and plenty of vegetables. There is said\r\nto be a good deal of cultivable land on the upper Gila, and if a\r\nterritory is created, it should embrace this. This would also include a\r\nlarge part of the Colorado valley above the junction of the Gila. That\r\nyou may succeed in your wishes with regard to Arizona, is the sincere\r\ndesire of\r\n\r\nYour friend and obliged serv't,\r\n  E. H. Fitzgerald.\"\r\n\r\nLt. Mowry, U. S. A.\r\n\r\n\r\nA subsequent letter from Major Fitzgerald dated Oct. 1st, says Tueson\r\ncontains rising five hundred inhabitants, the remainder of the Santa\r\nCruz altogether enough to make considerable over a thousand,\r\nindependent of the population towards and upon the Gila and Colorado,\r\nof which he remarks,\r\n\r\n\"You know more than I.\" \"There is not a doubt but that upon the\r\nlocation of the mail route, there will be a considerable emigration to\r\nthis country, and if a portion of Sonora be organized, large numbers\r\nwill come both from the East and West. The country is an excellent one\r\nfor stock of all kinds, of which there were great numbers where the\r\nApaches were gathered under the wing of the Catholic church. The\r\nvalleys of Santa Cruz, San Pedro, and Upper Gila, and also that of\r\nMessilla, contain large bodies of productive lands, and all the cereals\r\ngrow luxuriantly therein. THAT THERE IS MUCH SILVER IN THE TERRITORY\r\nTHERE IS NO DOUBT, but it requires capital to develop it. As yet but\r\nlittle progress has been made in mining. Evidences of old works are\r\nseen on many of the water courses, but operations have not yet been\r\nrecommenced, except at Arizona, Sopori, and Ariaola, principally\r\nbecause the country is very partially settled, and it is not safe to be\r\nat any distance from the mass of the population, and the troops. Copper\r\nore is found in many localities, but little gold is yet discovered. If\r\nthe road from El Paso to Fort Yuma be located by Parke's route, as many\r\nsuppose, A FINE COUNTRY WILL BE OPENED on the Gila and Lower San Pedro,\r\nwhich will produce ample supplies. The Territory presents no\r\ndifficulties of importance to the successful establishment of the road.\r\nFrequent stations and PROPER PROTECTION ARE ONLY REQUISITE TO ENSURE\r\nSUCCESS AS COMPLETELY AS THE MOST SANGUINE ANTICIPATE. Should Sonora,\r\nor even a portion of it be organized, this will be one of the most\r\npleasant localities of our country. A delightful climate, plenty of\r\nfine fruit, facility of supply by a port on the Pacific, semi-weekly\r\nmails from the east and west,--are only some of the attractions which\r\nit would possess.\r\n\r\nSonora is quiet. Many of the wealthy men there are in favor of\r\nannexation, it is said, but they have to keep silent on the subject for\r\nfear of noisy patriots, who would proclaim them traitors at once, if\r\nthey made a parade of their inclinations. The San Antonio and San Deigo\r\nmail passes through Tueson once a fortnight, and seems to have met with\r\nno important obstacle yet. A drove of mules accompanies it, which are\r\nharnessed in turn. When regular stations are established its speed will\r\nbe much increased. My last letter was not written with a view of the\r\nuse being made of it you mentioned, yet if it answers a good purpose, I\r\nhave no objection. It was but a careless note, but its contents were\r\ntruths, nevertheless.\" (This note demonstrated the facility of supply\r\nfor the Territory from the Pacific.)\r\n\r\n\"Most truly your friend,\r\n  (Signed,) E. H. Fitzgerald.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTubac, Gadsden's Purchase, 22d Oct., 1857.\r\n\r\n\"We have of late been seriously annoyed by the Apaches. Nearly all the\r\nanimals belonging to the citizens residing around Fort Buchanan have\r\nbeen driven off by the Apaches. They are very impudent, and commit\r\ntheir depredations in broad day-light, talk to the people while they\r\nare driving off the animals, and always escape without being molested.\r\n\r\nThe other day they came within 800 yards of the Fort and looked down\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nIn order to bring them to terms the Government ought to enlist 1000\r\nPinos and Papagos to accompany the military. Indians are the only\r\npersons who can successfully traverse these mountains and hunt up their\r\nhiding places. If this is not done, they will surely break up our\r\nsettlements here. Forts ought to be established in the very heart of\r\nthe Apache country, in the places fit, and used by them for\r\ncultivation. If this is done we will soon bring them to terms.\r\n\r\nUntil now, our mining establishments have not been molested by them,\r\nand we are going on in high glee. This is undoubtedly the richest\r\nsilver mining country in the world. If the United States will make just\r\nand liberal laws for us; give us protection; remove those trifling and\r\nunprofitable custom houses on the frontier, at least for 5 or 6 years;\r\nprocure us a transit through Sonora to Guaymas, and hasten along the\r\nrail-road to California, this will indeed be a prosperous country, and\r\nwill astonish the world with its production of silver and copper. But\r\nwith such terrible obstacles as those mentioned above and the great\r\nlength of transit to transport goods over the roads which we have to\r\ntake at present, progress only is possible for such as find mines of\r\nthe extraordinary and incredible richness of the Heintzelman vein. If\r\nthe present promises of few of these mines are realized, by working\r\nthem on a scale commensurate with their extent and richness, I have no\r\ndoubt but that they will equal in production the whole silver exports\r\nof Mexico.\r\n\r\nI think an appropriation ought to be made to sink artesian wells\r\nthrough the Papagos country, between San Xavier and the lower Gila.\r\nThis route cuts off about 100 miles from the best route via the Pinos\r\nvillages. It is laid down on my map, as a rail-road route, now at the\r\noffice of the Sonora Exploring and Mining Company, at Cincinnati, Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe country consists of a succession of plains and isolated mountain\r\nridges, none of which need to be crossed. In fact it is a dead level to\r\nFort Yuma, and, in consequence, no grading is necessary. There is\r\nscarcity of water, but the soil in general is excellent and grass\r\nabounds all along the line, while the mountains teem with minerals of\r\nthe richest description. The oxides and the sulphurets of copper are\r\nthe most beautiful and richest in the world. Silver undoubtedly exists\r\nof equal richness.\r\n\r\nAll the foothills contain gold, but I hardly think it will be extracted\r\nby the whites, as the localities are devoid of water, and they are not\r\nprobably rich enough to pay without sluicing on an extensive scale.\"\r\n\r\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,\r\n  Herman Ehrenberg.\r\n\r\nTo Lieut. S. Mowry, U. S. A.,\r\n  Delegate elect from Arizona,\r\n    Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only comment the writer has to make upon these statements is, that\r\ntwo years' residence among and acquaintance with the people of Arizona,\r\nhas convinced him of their absolute truth. At the last session of\r\nCongress a petition was presented, praying for a separate Territorial\r\norganization. The necessity for some legislation was admitted by both\r\nSenate and House; and bills creating a separate judicial district and\r\nland offices, passed both Houses, but owing to some minor differences\r\nand the lateness of the session, the bills failed to become a law.\r\n\r\nWith an increased population and prolonged grievances, the people of\r\nArizona are again about to present themselves as supplicants for that\r\nright inherent in the American heart--the right of self-government--and\r\nof protection under the law. Their petition sets forth in brief, plain\r\nterms, their situation and necessities, and prays simply for a\r\nseparation from New Mexico and a Territorial organization under the\r\nname of Arizona. As a matter of necessity for the successful carriage\r\nof the mail across the country, this Territorial organization is\r\nimperative. No contract for labor or supplies can be enforced in the\r\npresent condition of the country. Courts of law must be established,\r\nwith officers to enforce their mandates, or the contractors will be\r\nutterly unable to carry out their contract.\r\n\r\nThe great necessity of a safe and speedy overland communication with\r\nthe Pacific, has directed public attention to the organization of\r\nArizona as a separate Territory, and the desired legislation has\r\nreceived the unanimous endorsement of the press of the whole country.\r\nPetitions with thousands of signatures from leading citizens of the\r\nmajority of the states of the Union, will be presented to Congress\r\nasking for the immediate organization of the new Territory as the best\r\nmeans to at once open a highway to the Pacific; and so important has\r\nthis view of the question been deemed as to call from the President of\r\nthe United States a recommendation in his message to Congress. No\r\nopposition has been made to the most just prayer of the people of\r\nArizona, and it is believed that none will be made, unless it comes\r\nfrom New Mexico. It must be born in mind that the Gadsden Purchase was\r\nnot originally an integral part of New Mexico; that it was acquired\r\nyears after the treaty of Gaudaloupe Hidalgo, and was only attached to\r\nthe territory of New Mexico as a temporary expedient. It must also be\r\nremembered that the Gadsden Purchase, with the portion of New Mexico\r\nwhich it is proposed to include within the limits of the territory of\r\nArizona, is separated from New Mexico proper by natural boundaries;\r\nthat it derives no benefit from the present connection, and that any\r\nopposition to the desired legislation arises from the Mexican\r\npopulation, which fears the influence of a large American emigration.\r\nMoreover, that New Mexico contains upwards of 200,000 square miles, and\r\nthat its organic act provides for its partition; showing clearly that\r\nCongress anticipated, at no remote day, the settlement of the country\r\nby an American population, and its erection into several territories\r\nand states. The only effect of the present connection of Arizona with\r\nNew Mexico is to crush out the voice and sentiment of the American\r\npeople in the territory; and years of emigration, under present\r\nauspices, would not serve to counterbalance or equal the influence of\r\nthe 60,000 Mexican residents of New Mexico. New Mexico has never\r\nencouraged American population. She is thoroughly Mexican in sentiment,\r\nand desires to remain so.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of State policy, the organization of Arizona is of the\r\nfirst importance. Situated between New Mexico and Sonora, it is\r\npossible now to make it a thoroughly American State, which will\r\nconstantly exert its influence in both directions, to nationalize the\r\nother two. New Mexico is at present thoroughly Mexican in its character\r\nand vote. Sonora, if we acquire it at once, will be the same. By\r\nseparating Arizona from it, and encouraging an American emigration, it\r\nwill become \"the leaven which shall leaven the whole lump.\" By allowing\r\nit to remain attached to New Mexico, or by attaching it to Sonora when\r\nacquired, the American influence will be swallowed up in the great\r\npreponderance of the Mexican vote. The Apache Indian is preparing\r\nSonora for the rule of a higher civilization than the Mexican. In the\r\npast half century, the Mexican element has disappeared from what is now\r\ncalled Arizona, before the devastating career of the Apache. It is\r\nevery day retreating further South, leaving to us, when it is ripe for\r\nour possession, the territory without the population.\r\n\r\nThe incentives to emigration to Arizona, in addition to the charm which\r\nthe discovery of mineral wealth carries to every mind, are very great.\r\nThe writer, in an extended tour through the Southern States, found many\r\npeople, mostly young men of moderate means, ready and anxious to\r\nemigrate. The movement is still stronger in Southwestern States, and\r\nalready many a train of wagons is on its way. It will have no end for\r\nyears, for so mild and healthy is the climate that emigration is\r\npracticable at all seasons. Snow never lies on the soil, and frost is\r\nalmost unknown. The contracts already authorized by Congress involve\r\nthe expenditure of six millions of dollars in the next six years; the\r\ntroops in the Territory will cost as much more. Here is enough money in\r\nhard sub-treasury coin, to draw a large population, independent of\r\nother considerations. All ready in many places the enterprising\r\nmerchant exposes his stock of goods only two months from San Francisco,\r\nbut he does it with the prayer that the Apache may pass him by, and too\r\noften he sees his hard-earned profits disappear before the Indian's\r\nsuccessful foray.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a firm government in Arizona will extend the\r\nprotection of the United States over American citizens resident in the\r\nadjoining Mexican provinces. This protection is most urgently demanded.\r\nEnglishmen in Sonora enjoy not only perfect immunity in the pursuit of\r\nbusiness, but also encouragement. Americans are robbed openly by\r\nMexican officials, insulted, thrown into prison, and sometimes put to\r\ndeath. No redress is ever demanded or received. This state of things\r\nhas so long existed that the name of American has become a byword and a\r\nreproach in northern Mexico, and the people of that frontier believe\r\nthat we have neither the power nor the inclination to protect our own\r\ncitizens. The influence of a Territorial government, with the tide of\r\nAmerican emigration which will surely follow it, must entirely change\r\nthe tone and temper of these Mexican States.\r\n\r\nThe population of Arizona to-day, exceeds that of Washington Territory,\r\nand is far greater than was that of Minnesota, Kansas or Nebraska, at\r\nthe time of their organization. An election for a Delegate has been\r\nheld, at which several hundred votes were polled, and the writer\r\nreturned without opposition. The unsettled and dangerous condition of\r\nthe country prevented a convention being held, but letters have been\r\nreceived from all parts of the Territory, expressing a hearty\r\nconcurrence in the election on the part of those unable to vote, and an\r\nearnest desire for the Territorial organization.\r\n\r\nA number of gentlemen at present in Washington, can testify from actual\r\nobservation, to the truth of the statements here made in reference to\r\nArizona--among them I am permitted to name General Anderson, late U. S.\r\nSenator from Tennessee, who almost alone, with rare perseverance and\r\ncourage, explored, in 1850, the whole length of the Territory, Major\r\nHeintzelman, U. S. A., whose long station at Fort Yuma made him\r\nacquainted with the resources of the country, and who has shown at once\r\nhis intelligence and foresight and his faith in the prospective wealth\r\nof the silver region, by large investments of capital, Col. A. B. Gray,\r\nlate U. S. Surveyor of the Mexican Boundary line, I. Smith McMicken,\r\nEsq., whose residence for many years on the Mexican frontier has\r\nentitled his opinion to some weight, and A. H. Campbell, Esq.,\r\nSuperintendent of Wagon Roads, whose information is full and reliable.\r\nTo these names it may not be improper to add that of the writer, who\r\nhas for two years past, while residing at the junction of the Gila and\r\nColorado Rivers, made the new Territory and its resources, an object of\r\nconstant observation and study, and whose experience on the Pacific\r\ncoast, and in the frontier Territories, and on the route across the\r\ncontinent, during the past five years, has enabled him to speak\r\nunderstandingly of the capabilities and necessities of a new country,\r\nand of a frontier people.\r\n\r\nIn five years a great State may be built upon this remote frontier, and\r\na population gathered, such as will, when we make further acquisition\r\nof territory, spread at once over it, diffusing national sentiment and\r\nextending the area of American principles.\r\n\r\nAside from these considerations, justice and humanity, imperatively\r\ndemand that Congress shall bear and at once answer the prayer of the\r\npeople of Arizona for protection. If these considerations fail, then\r\nthey offer INTEREST; for the organization of the Territory is the\r\nguarantee of a supply of silver, which will create as great a\r\nrevolution in the commercial world as has the gold of California.\r\nArizona will be known as the silver State, and the prediction of\r\nHumboldt, that the balance between gold and silver, destroyed by the\r\nCalifornia discoveries, would one day be restored, will be made good,\r\nfrom the resources of the Gadsden purchase.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, your humble petitioners, citizens of the United\r\nStates, and residents of the Territory known as the Gadsden Purchase,\r\nrespectfully represent:\r\n\r\nThat since the annexation of their Territory to the United States, they\r\nhave been totally unprotected from Indian depredations and civil crimes.\r\n\r\nThat the protection of the Mexican Government has been with drawn, and\r\nthat it has not been replaced by any visible protection from the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThat the annexation of the Purchase to New Mexico, carried with it no\r\nprotection for life or property.\r\n\r\nThat the present force of United States troops, four companies of\r\ndragoons, reduced by desertion and death to about one half, is entirely\r\ninadequate to protect us against the depredations of the Apaches.\r\n\r\nThat many of your petitioners have expended their time and means in\r\nopening and prospecting rich mines of Copper and Silver, and have been\r\ndriven from them by the Indians--losing their all, and also many\r\nvaluable lives.\r\n\r\nThat the Territory is immensely rich in minerals, especially Silver and\r\nCopper; and, as your petitioners most firmly believe, the development\r\nof these mines will make a change in the currency of the world, only\r\nequalled by that caused by the gold mines of California.\r\n\r\nThat a great part of the Territory, between the Rio Grande and Tueson,\r\nis susceptible of cultivation and will support a large agricultural\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThat this portion of the Territory is in the hands of the Apaches, and\r\nuseless, unless redeemed from their grasp and protected to the farmer.\r\n\r\nThat the highways of the Territory are stained with the blood of\r\ncitizens of the United States, shed by Indians and by public marauders,\r\nwho commit their crimes in open day, knowing there is no law to\r\nrestrain and no magistrate to arrest them.\r\n\r\nThat this Territory, under a separate organization, would attract a\r\nlarge population and become immediately developed: and, that its\r\nisolation--its large Indian population--its proximity to a\r\nsemi-civilized Mexican province, and its peculiar and wonderful\r\nresources, demand protection from the Government more emphatically than\r\nany other territory yet recognised.\r\n\r\nThat our soil has been stained with the blood of American citizens,\r\nshed by Mexican hands, in an armed invasion of our Territory near\r\nSonoita, and that there is no civil magistrate or officer here to even\r\nprotest against such an outrage.\r\n\r\nThat throughout their whole Territory, from the Rio Grande to the Rio\r\nColorado, six hundred miles, there is no Court of Record, and no\r\nredress except that inefficiently administered in a Justice's Court,\r\nfor civil injuries or crimes.\r\n\r\nThat the population of the Territory is much greater than was that of\r\nKansas or Nebraska or Washington Territory, at the time of their\r\norganization, and that it is steadily increasing, and will, under the\r\ninfluence of the Road and Mail Bills of the last Congress, be greatly\r\naugmented.\r\n\r\nThat there are no post routes or mail facilities throughout the\r\nTerritory, and that finally, we are cut off from all the comforts of\r\ncivilization--and that we claim, as a right, that protection which the\r\nUnited States should everywhere extend to her humblest citizen.\r\nWherefore your petitioners humbly pray that the Gadsden Purchase may be\r\nseparated from New Mexico and erected into a separate Territory under\r\nthe name of Arizona, with such boundaries as may seem proper to your\r\nhonorable bodies, and that such other legislation may be made as shall\r\nbe best calculated to place us on the same footing as our more\r\nfortunate brethren of Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota, Oregon and\r\nWashington, that we may be enabled to build up a prosperous and\r\nthriving State, and to nourish on this extreme frontier a healthy\r\nnational sentiment. And we, as in duty bound, will ever pray.\r\n\r\n[Signed by more than five hundred resident voters.]",
