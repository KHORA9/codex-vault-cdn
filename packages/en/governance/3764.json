It was\r\nknown as the tannery house. His reasons for this step, when at length\r\ndiscovered, were generally commended: they were, in fact, a\r\ndisinclination to leave a girl of Cynthia's tender age alone on Thousand\r\nAcre Hill while he journeyed on his affairs about the country. The Rev.\r\nMr. Satterlee, gaunt, red-faced, but the six feet of him a man and a\r\nChristian, from his square-toed boots to the bleaching yellow hair around\r\nhis temples, offered to become her teacher. For by this time Cynthia had\r\nexhausted the resources of the little school among the birches.\r\n\r\nThe four years of her life in the tannery house which are now briefly to\r\nbe chronicled were, for her, full of happiness and peace. Though the\r\nyoung may sorrow, they do not often mourn. Cynthia missed her father; at\r\ntimes, when the winds kept her wakeful at night, she wept for him. But\r\nshe loved Jethro Bass and served him with a devotion that filled his\r\nheart with strange ecstasies--yes, and forebodings. In all his existence\r\nhe had never known a love like this. He may have imagined it once, back\r\nin the bright days of his youth; but the dreams of its fulfilment had\r\nfallen far short of the exquisite touch of the reality in which he now\r\nspent his days at home. In summer, when she sat, in the face of all the\r\nconventions of the village, reading under the butternut tree before the\r\nhouse, she would feel his eyes upon her, and the mysterious yearning in\r\nthem would startle her. Often during her lessons with Mr. Satterlee in\r\nthe parlor of the parsonage she would hear a noise outside and perceive\r\nJethro leaning against the pillar. Both Cynthia and Mr. Satterlee knew\r\nthat he was there, and both, by a kind of tacit agreement, ignored the\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nCynthia, in this period, undertook Jethro's education, too. She could\r\nhave induced him to study the making of Latin verse by the mere asking.\r\nDuring those days which he spent at home, and which he had grown to value\r\nbeyond price, he might have been seen seated on the ground with his back\r\nto the butternut tree while Cynthia read aloud from the well-worn books\r\nwhich had been her father's treasures, books that took on marvels of\r\nmeaning from her lips. Cynthia's powers of selection were not remarkable\r\nat this period, and perhaps it was as well that she never knew the effect\r\nof the various works upon the hitherto untamed soul of her listener.\r\nMilton and Tennyson and Longfellow awoke in him by their very music\r\ntroubled and half-formed regrets; Carlyle's \"Frederick the Great\" set up\r\ntumultuous imaginings; but the \"Life of Jackson\" (as did the story of\r\nNapoleon long ago) stirred all that was masterful in his blood.\r\nUnlettered as he was, Jethro had a power which often marks the American\r\nof action--a singular grasp of the application of any sentence or\r\nparagraph to his own life; and often, about this time, he took away the\r\nbreath of a judge or a senator by flinging at them a chunk of Carlyle or\r\nParton.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps as well that Cynthia was not a woman at this time, and\r\nthat she had grown up with him, as it were. His love, indeed, was that of\r\na father for a daughter; but it held within it as a core the revived love\r\nof his youth for Cynthia, her mother. Tender as were the manifestations\r\nof this love, Cynthia never guessed the fires within, for there was in\r\ntruth something primeval in the fierceness of his passion. She was his\r\nnow--his alone, to cherish and sweeten the declining years of his life,\r\nand when by a chance Jethro looked upon her and thought of the suitor who\r\nwas to come in the fulness of her years, he burned with a hatred which it\r\nis given few men to feel. It was well for Jethro that these thoughts came\r\nnot often.\r\n\r\nSometimes, in the summer afternoons, they took long drives through the\r\ntown behind Jethro's white horse on business. \"Jethro's gal,\" as Cynthia\r\ncame to be affectionately called, held the reins while Jethro went in to\r\ntalk to the men folk. One August evening found Cynthia thus beside a\r\npoplar in front of Amos Cuthbert's farmhouse, a poplar that shimmered\r\ngreen-gold in the late afternoon, and from the buggy-seat Cynthia looked\r\ndown upon a thousand purple hilltops and mountain peaks of another state.\r\nThe view aroused in the girl visions of the many wonders which life was\r\nto hold, and she did not hear the sharp voice beside her until the woman\r\nhad spoken twice. Jethro came out in the middle of the conversation,\r\nnodded to Mrs. Cuthbert, and drove off.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro,\" asked Cynthia, presently, \"what is a mortgage?\"\r\n\r\nJethro struck the horse with the whip, an uncommon action with him, and\r\nthe buggy was jerked forward sharply over the boulders.\r\n\r\n\"Er--who's b'en talkin' about mortgages, Cynthy?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Cuthbert said that when folks had mortgage held over them they had\r\nto take orders whether they liked them or not. She said that Amos had to\r\ndo what you told him because there was a mortgage. That isn't so is it?\"\r\n\r\nJethro did not speak. Presently Cynthia laid her hand over his.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Cuthbert is a spiteful woman,\" she said. \"I know the reason why\r\npeople obey you--it's because you're so great. And Daddy used to tell me\r\nso.\"\r\n\r\nA tremor shook Jethro's frame and the hand on which hers rested, and all\r\nthe way down the mountain valleys to Coniston village he did not speak\r\nagain. But Cynthia was used to his silences, and respected them.\r\n\r\nTo Ephraim Prescott, who, as the days went on, found it more and more\r\ndifficult to sew harness on account of his rheumatism, Jethro was not\r\nonly a great man but a hero. For Cynthia was vaguely troubled at having\r\nfound one discontent. She was wont to entertain Ephraim on the days when\r\nhis hands failed him, when he sat sunning himself before his door; and\r\nshe knew that he was honest.\r\n\r\n\"Who's b'en talkin' to you, Cynthia?\" he cried. \"Why, Jethro's the\r\nbiggest man I know, and the best. I don't like to think where some of us\r\nwould have b'en if he hadn't given us a lift.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he has enemies, Cousin Eph,\" said Cynthia, still troubled. \"What\r\ngreat man hain't?\" exclaimed the soldier. \"Jethro's enemies hain't worth\r\nthinkin' about.\"\r\n\r\nThe thought that Jethro had enemies was very painful to Cynthia, and she\r\nwanted to know who they were that she might show them a proper contempt\r\nif she met them. Lem Hallowell brushed aside the subject with his usual\r\nbluff humor, and pinched her cheek and told her not to trouble her head;\r\nAmanda Hatch dwelt upon the inherent weakness in the human race, and the\r\nRev. Mr. Satterlee faced the question once, during a history lesson. The\r\nnation's heroes came into inevitable comparison with Jethro Bass. Was\r\nWashington so good a man? and would not Jethro have been as great as the\r\nFather of his Country if he had had the opportunities?\r\n\r\nThe answers sorely tried Mr. Satterlee's conscience, albeit he was not a\r\nman of the world. It set him thinking. He liked Jethro, this man of\r\nrugged power whose word had become law in the state. He knew best that\r\nside of him which Cynthia saw; and--if the truth be told--as a native of\r\nConiston Mr. Satterlee felt in the bottom of his heart a certain pride in\r\nJethro. The minister's opinions well represented the attitude of his\r\ntime. He had not given thought to the subject--for such matters had came\r\nto be taken for granted. A politician now was a politician, his ways and\r\nstandards set apart from those of other citizens, and not to be judged by\r\nmen without the pale of public life. Mr. Satterlee in his limited vision\r\ndid not then trace the matter to its source, did not reflect that Jethro\r\nBass himself was almost wholly responsible in that state for the\r\ncondition of politics and politicians. Coniston was proud of Jethro,\r\nprouder of him than ever since his last great victory in the Legislature,\r\nwhich brought the Truro Railroad through to Harwich and settled their\r\ntownsman more firmly than ever before in the seat of power. Every\r\nstatesman who drove into their little mountain village and stopped at the\r\ntannery house made their blood beat faster. Senators came, and\r\nrepresentatives, and judges, and governors, \"to git their orders,\" as\r\nRias Richardson briefly put it, and Jethro could make or unmake them at a\r\nword. Each was scanned from the store where Rias now reigned supreme, and\r\nfrom the harness shop across the road. Some drove away striving to bite\r\nfrom their lips the tell-tale smile which arose in spite of them; others\r\ntried to look happy, despite the sentence of doom to which they had\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\nJethro Bass was indeed a great man to make such as these tremble or\r\nrejoice. When he went abroad with Cynthia awheel or afoot, some took off\r\ntheir hats--an unheard-of thing in Coniston. If he stopped at the store,\r\nthey scanned his face for the mood he was in before venturing their\r\nremarks; if he lingered for a moment in front of the house of Amanda\r\nHatch, the whole village was advised of the circumstance before\r\nnightfall.\r\n\r\nTwo personages worthy of mention here visited the tannery house during\r\nthe years that Cynthia lived with Jethro. The Honorable Heth Sutton drove\r\nover from Clovelly attended by his prime minister, Mr. Bijah Bixby. The\r\nHonorable Heth did not attempt to conceal the smile with which he went\r\naway, and he stopped at the store long enough to enable Rias to produce\r\ncertain refreshments from depths unknown to the United States Internal\r\nRevenue authorities. Mr. Sutton shook hands with everybody, including\r\nJake Wheeler. Well he might. He came to Coniston a private citizen, and\r\ndrove away to all intents and purposes a congressman: the darling wish of\r\nhis life realized after heaven knows how many caucuses and conventions of\r\ndisappointment, when Jethro had judged it expedient for one reason or\r\nanother that a north countryman should go. By the time the pair reached\r\nBrampton, Chamberlain Bixby was introducing his chief as Congressman\r\nSutton, and by this title he was known for many years to come.\r\n\r\nAnother day, when the snow lay in great billows on the ground and filled\r\nthe mountain valleys, when the pines were rusty from the long winter, two\r\nother visitors drove to Coniston in a two-horse sleigh. The sun was\r\nshining brightly, the wind held its breath, and the noon-day warmth was\r\nalmost like that of spring. Those who know the mountain country will\r\nremember the joy of many such days. Cynthia, standing in the sun on the\r\nporch, breathing deep of the pure air, recognized, as the sleigh drew\r\nnear, the somewhat portly gentleman driving, and the young woman beside\r\nhim regally clad in furs who looked patronizingly at the tannery house as\r\nshe took the reins. The young woman was Miss Cassandra Hopkins, and the\r\nportly gentleman, the Honorable Alva himself, patron of the drama, who\r\nhad entered upon his governorship and now wished to be senator.\r\n\r\n\"Jethro Bass home?\" he called out.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bass is home,\" answered Cynthia. The girl in the sleigh murmured\r\nsomething, laughing a little, and Cynthia flushed. Mr. Hopkins gave a\r\nsomewhat peremptory knock at the door and was admitted by Millicent\r\nSkinner, but Cynthia stood staring at Cassandra in the sleigh, some\r\ninstinct warning her of a coming skirmish.\r\n\r\n\"Do you live here all the year round?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\nMiss Cassandra shrugged as though that were beyond her comprehension.\r\n\r\n\"I'd die in a place like this,\" she said. \"No balls, or theatres. Doesn't\r\nyour father take you around the state?\"\r\n\r\n\"My father's dead,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Your name's Cynthia Wetherell, isn't it? You know Bob Worthington,\r\ndon't you? He's gone to Harvard now, but he was a great friend of mine at\r\nAndover.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia didn't answer. It would not be fair to say that she felt a pang,\r\nthough it might add to the romance of this narrative. But her dislike for\r\nthe girl in the sleigh decidedly increased. How was she, in her\r\ninexperience, to know that the radiant beauty in furs was what the boys\r\nat Phillips Andover called an \"old stager.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you live with Jethro Bass,\" was Miss Cassandra's next remark. \"He's\r\nrich enough to take you round the state and give you everything you\r\nwant.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have everything I want,\" replied Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't call living here having everything I wanted,\" declared Miss\r\nHopkins, with a contemptuous glance at the tannery house.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you wouldn't,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\nMiss Hopkins was nettled. She was out of humor that day, besides she\r\nshared some of her father's political ambition. If he went to Washington,\r\nshe went too.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you know Jethro Bass was rich?\" she demanded, imprudently. \"Why,\r\nmy father gave twenty thousand dollars to be governor, and Jethro Bass\r\nmust have got half of it.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia's eyes were of that peculiar gray which, lighted by love or\r\nanger, once seen, are never forgotten. One hand was on the dashboard of\r\nthe cutter, the other had seized the seat. Her voice was steady, and the\r\nthree words she spoke struck Miss Hopkins with startling effect.\r\n\r\nMiss Hopkins's breath was literally taken away, and for once she found no\r\nretort. Let it be said for her that this was a new experience with a new\r\ncreature. A demure country girl turn into a wildcat before her very eyes!\r\nPerhaps it was as well for both that the door of the house opened and the\r\nHonorable Alva interrupted their talk, and without so much as a glance at\r\nCynthia he got hurriedly into the sleigh and drove off. When Cynthia\r\nturned, the points of color still high in her cheeks and the light still\r\nablaze in her eyes, she surprised Jethro gazing at her from the porch,\r\nand some sorrow she felt rather than beheld stopped the confession on her\r\nlips. It would be unworthy of her even to repeat such slander, and the\r\ncolor surged again into her face for very shame of her anger. Cassandra\r\nHopkins had not been worthy of it.\r\n\r\nJethro did not speak, but slipped his hand into hers, and thus they stood\r\nfor a long time gazing at the snow fields between the pines on the\r\nheights of Coniston.\r\n\r\nThe next summer, was the first which the painter--pioneer of summer\r\nvisitors there--spent at Coniston. He was an unsuccessful painter, who\r\nbecame, by a process which he himself does not to-day completely\r\nunderstand, a successful writer of novels. As a character, however, he\r\nhimself confesses his inadequacy, and the chief interest in him for the\r\nreaders of this narrative is that he fell deeply in love with Cynthia\r\nWetherell at nineteen. It is fair to mention in passing that other young\r\nmen were in love with Cynthia at this time, notably Eben Hatch--history\r\nrepeating itself. Once, in a moment of madness, Eben confessed his love,\r\nthe painter never did: and he has to this day a delicious memory which\r\nhas made Cynthia the heroine of many of his stories. He boarded with\r\nChester Perkins, and he was humored by the village as a harmless but\r\namiable lunatic.\r\n\r\nThe painter had never conceived that a New England conscience and a\r\ntemper of no mean proportions could dwell together in the body of a wood\r\nnymph. When he had first seen Cynthia among the willows by Coniston\r\nWater, he had thought her a wood nymph. But she scolded him for his\r\nimpropriety with so unerring a choice of words that he fell in love with\r\nher intellect, too. He spent much of his time to the neglect of his\r\ncanvases under the butternut tree in front of Jethro's house trying to\r\npersuade Cynthia to sit for her portrait; and if Jethro himself had not\r\noverheard one of these arguments, the portrait never would have been\r\npainted. Jethro focussed a look upon the painter.\r\n\r\n\"Er--painter-man, be you? Paint Cynthy's picture?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't want to be painted, Uncle Jethro. I won't be painted!\"\r\n\r\n\"H-how much for a good picture? Er--only want the best--only want the\r\nbest.\"\r\n\r\nThe painter said a few things, with pardonable heat, to the effect--well,\r\nnever mind the effect. His remarks made no impression whatever upon\r\nJethro.\r\n\r\n\"Er---paint the picture--paint the picture, and then we'll talk about the\r\nprice. Er--wait a minute.\"\r\n\r\nHe went into the house, and they heard him lumbering up the stairs.\r\nCynthia sat with her back to the artist, pretending to read, but\r\npresently she turned to him.\r\n\r\n\"I'll never forgive you--never, as long as I live,\" she cried, \"and I\r\nwon't be painted!\"\r\n\r\n\"N-not to please me, Cynthy?\" It was Jethro's voice.\r\n\r\nHer look softened. She laid down the book and went up to him on the porch\r\nand put her hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Do you really want it so much as all that, Uncle Jethro?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Callate I do, Cynthy,\" he answered. He held a bundle covered with\r\nnewspaper in his hand, he looked down at Cynthia.\r\n\r\nHe seated himself on the edge of the porch and for the moment seemed lost\r\nin revery. Then he began slowly to unwrap the newspaper from the bundle:\r\nthere were five layers of it, but at length he disclosed a bolt of\r\ncardinal cloth.\r\n\r\n\"Call this to mind, Cynthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she answered with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"H-how's this for the dress, Mr. Painter-man?\" said Jethro, with a pride\r\nthat was ill-concealed.\r\n\r\nThe painter started up from his seat and took the material in his hands\r\nand looked at Cynthia. He belonged to a city club where he was popular\r\nfor his knack of devising costumes, and a vision of Cynthia as the\r\ndaughter of a Doge of Venice arose before his eyes. Wonder of wonders,\r\nthe daughter of a Doge discovered in a New England hill village! The\r\npainter seized his pad and pencil and with a few strokes, guided by\r\ninspiration, sketched the costume then and there and held it up to\r\nJethro, who blinked at it in astonishment. But Jethro was suspicious of\r\nhis own sensations.\r\n\r\n\"Er--well--Godfrey--g-guess that'll do.\" Then came the involuntary:\r\n\"W-wouldn't a-thought you had it in you. How about it, Cynthy?\" and he\r\nheld it up for her inspection.\r\n\r\n\"If you are pleased, it's all I care about, Uncle Jethro,\" she answered,\r\nand then, her face suddenly flushing, \"You must promise me on your honor\r\nthat nobody in Coniston shall know about it, 'Mr. Painter-man'.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this she always called him \"Mr. Painter-man,\"--when she was pleased\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nSo the cardinal cloth was come to its usefulness at last. It was\r\ninevitable that Sukey Kittredge, the village seamstress, should be taken\r\ninto confidence. It was no small thing to take Sukey into confidence, for\r\nshe was the legitimate successor in more ways than one of Speedy Bates,\r\nand much of Cynthia and the artist's ingenuity was spent upon devising a\r\nform of oath which would hold Sukey silent. Sukey, however, got no small\r\nconsolation from the sense of the greatness of the trust confided in her,\r\nand of the uproar she could make in Coniston if she chose. The painter,\r\nto do him justice, was the real dressmaker, and did everything except cut\r\nthe cloth and sew it together. He sent to friends of his in the city for\r\ncertain paste jewels and ornaments, and one day Cynthia stood in the old\r\ntannery shed--hastily transformed into a studio--before a variously moved\r\naudience. Sukey, having adjusted the last pin, became hysterical over her\r\nhandiwork, Millicent Skinner stared openmouthed, words having failed her\r\nfor once, and Jethro thrust his hands in his pockets in a quiet ecstasy\r\nof approbation.\r\n\r\n\"A-always had a notion that cloth'd set you off, Cynthy,\" said he,\r\n\"er--next time I go to the state capital you come along--g-guess it'll\r\nsurprise 'em some.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess it would, Uncle Jethro,\" said Cynthia, laughing.\r\n\r\nJethro postponed two political trips of no small importance to be present\r\nat the painting of that picture, and he would sit silently by the hour in\r\na corner of the shed watching every stroke of the brush. Never stood\r\nDoge's daughter in her jewels and seed pearls amidst stranger\r\nsurroundings,--the beam, and the centre post around which the old white\r\nhorse had toiled in times gone by, and all the piled-up, disused\r\nmachinery of forgotten days. And never was Venetian lady more unconscious\r\nof her environment than Cynthia.\r\n\r\nThe portrait was of the head and shoulders alone, and when he had given\r\nit the last touch, the painter knew that, for once in his life, he had\r\ndone a good thing. Never before; perhaps, had the fire of such\r\ninspiration been given him. Jethro, who expressed himself in terms (for\r\nhim) of great enthusiasm, was for going to Boston immediately to purchase\r\na frame commensurate with the importance of such a work of art, but the\r\nartist had his own views on that subject and sent to New York for this\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nThe day after the completion of the picture a rugged figure in rawhide\r\nboots and coonskin cap approached Chester Perkins's house, knocked at the\r\ndoor, and inquired for the \"Painter-man.\" It was Jethro. The\r\n\"Painter-man\" forthwith went out into the rain behind the shed, where a\r\nsomewhat curious colloquy took place.\r\n\r\n\"G-guess I'm willin' to pay you full as much as it's worth,\" said Jethro,\r\nproducing a cowhide wallet. \"Er--what figure do you allow it comes to\r\nwith the frame?\"\r\n\r\nThe artist was past taking offence, since Jethro had long ago become for\r\nhim an engrossing study.\r\n\r\n\"I will send you the bill for the frame, Mr. Bass,\" he said, \"the picture\r\nbelongs to Cynthia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Earn your livin' by paintin', don't you--earn your livin'?\"\r\n\r\nThe painter smiled a little bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said, \"if I did, I shouldn't be--alive. Mr. Bass, have you ever\r\ndone anything the pleasure of doing which was pay enough, and to spare?\"\r\n\r\nJethro looked at him, and something very like admiration came into the\r\nface that was normally expressionless.\r\n\r\nHe put up his wallet a little awkwardly, and held out his hand more\r\nawkwardly.\r\n\r\n\"You be more of a feller than I thought for,\" he said, and strode off\r\nthrough the drizzle toward Coniston. The painter walked slowly to the\r\nkitchen, where Chester Perkins and his wife were sitting down to supper.\r\n\r\n\"Jethro got a mortgage on you, too?\" asked Chester.\r\n\r\nThe artist had his reward, for when the picture was hung at length in the\r\nlittle parlor of the tannery house it became a source of pride to\r\nConiston second only to Jethro himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTime passes, and the engines of the Truro Railroad are now puffing in and\r\nout of the yards of Worthington's mills in Brampton, and a fine layer of\r\ndust covers the old green stage which has worn the road for so many years\r\nover Truro Gap. If you are ever in Brampton, you can still see the stage,\r\nif you care to go into the back of what was once Jim Sanborn's livery\r\nstable, now owned by Mr. Sherman of the Brampton House.\r\n\r\nConventions and elections had come and gone, and the Honorable Heth\r\nSutton had departed triumphantly to Washington, cheered by his neighbors\r\nin Clovelly. Chamberlain Bixby was left in charge there, supreme. Who\r\ncould be more desirable as a member of Congress than Mr. Sutton, who had\r\nso ably served his party (and Jethro) by holding the House against the\r\ninsurgents in the matter of the Truro Bill? Mr. Sutton was, moreover, a\r\ngentleman, an owner of cattle and land, a man of substance whom lesser\r\nmen were proud to mention as a friend--a very hill-Rajah with stock in\r\nrailroads and other enterprises, who owed allegiance and paid tribute\r\nalone to the Great Man of Coniston.\r\n\r\nMr. Sutton was one who would make himself felt even in the capital of the\r\nUnited States--felt and heard. And he had not been long in the Halls of\r\nCongress before he made a speech which rang under the very dome of the\r\nCapitol. So said the Brampton and Harwich papers, at least, though rivals\r\nand detractors of Mr. Sutton declared that they could find no matter in\r\nit which related to the subject of a bill, but that is neither here nor\r\nthere. The oration began with a lengthy tribute to the resources and\r\nhistory of his state, and ended by a declaration that the speaker was in\r\nCongress at no man's bidding, but as the servant of the common people of\r\nhis district.\r\n\r\nUnder the lamp of the little parlor in the tannery house, Cynthia (who\r\nhas now arrived at the very serious age of nineteen) was reading the\r\npapers to Jethro and came upon Mr. Sutton's speech. There were four\r\ncolumns of it, but Jethro seemed to take delight in every word; and\r\nportions of the noblest parts of it, indeed, he had Cynthia read over\r\nagain. Sometimes, in the privacy of his home, Jethro was known to\r\nchuckle, and to Cynthia's surprise he chuckled more than usual that\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro,\" she said at length, when she had laid the paper down, \"I\r\nthought that you sent Mr. Sutton to Congress.\"\r\n\r\nJethro leaned forward.\r\n\r\n\"What put that into your head, Cynthy?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" answered the girl, \"everybody says so,--Moses Hatch, Rias, and\r\nCousin Eph. Didn't you?\"\r\n\r\nJethro looked at her, as she thought, strangely.\r\n\r\n\"You're too young to know anything about such things, Cynthy,\" he said,\r\n\"too young.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you make all the judges and senators and congressmen in the state, I\r\nknow you do. Why,\" exclaimed Cynthia, indignantly, \"why does Mr. Sutton\r\nsay the people elected him when he owes everything to you?\"\r\n\r\nJethro, arose abruptly and flung a piece of wood into the stove, and then\r\nhe stood with his back to her. Her instinct told her that he was\r\nsuffering, though she could not fathom the cause, and she rose swiftly\r\nand drew him down into the chair beside her.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" she said anxiously. \"Have you got rheumatism, too, like\r\nCousin Eph? All old men seem to have rheumatism.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Cynthy, it hain't rheumatism,\" he managed to answer; \"wimmen folks\r\nhadn't ought to mix up in politics. They--they don't understand 'em,\r\nCynthy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I shall understand them some day, because I am your daughter--now\r\nthat--now that I have only you, I am your daughter, am I not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" he answered huskily, with his hand on her hair.\r\n\r\n\"And I know more than most women now,\" continued Cynthia, triumphantly.\r\n\"I'm going to be such a help to you soon--very soon. I've read a lot of\r\nhistory, and I know some of the Constitution by heart. I know why old\r\nTimothy Prescott fought in the Revolution--it was to get rid of kings,\r\nwasn't it, and to let the people have a chance? The people can always be\r\ntrusted to do what is right, can't they, Uncle Jethro?\"\r\n\r\nJethro was silent, but Cynthia did not seem to notice that. After a space\r\nshe spoke again:--\"I've been thinking it all out about you, Uncle\r\nJethro.\"\r\n\r\n\"A-about me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know why you are able to send men to Congress and make judges of\r\nthem. It's because the people have chosen you to do all that for\r\nthem--you are so great and good.\"\r\n\r\nJethro did not answer.\r\n\r\nAlthough the month was March, it was one of those wonderful still nights\r\nthat sometimes come in the mountain-country when the wind is silent in\r\nthe notches and the stars seem to burn nearer to the earth. Cynthia awoke\r\nand lay staring for an instant at the red planet which hung over the\r\nblack and ragged ridge, and then she arose quickly and knocked at the\r\ndoor across the passage.\r\n\r\n\"Are you ill, Uncle Jethro?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he answered, \"no, Cynthy. Go to bed. Er--I was just\r\nthinkin'--thinkin', that's all, Cynthy.\"\r\n\r\nThough all his life he had eaten sparingly, Cynthia noticed that he\r\nscarcely touched his breakfast the next morning, and two hours later he\r\nwent unexpectedly to the state capital. That day, too, Coniston was\r\nclothed in clouds, and by afternoon a wild March snowstorm was sweeping\r\ndown the face of the mountain, piling against doorways and blocking the\r\nroads. Through the storm Cynthia fought her way to the harness shop, for\r\nEphraim Prescott had taken to his bed, bound hand and foot by rheumatism.\r\n\r\nMuch of that spring Ephraim was all but helpless, and Cynthia spent many\r\ndays nursing him and reading to him. Meanwhile the harness industry\r\nlanguished. Cynthia and Ephraim knew, and Coniston guessed, that Jethro\r\nwas taking care of Ephraim, and strong as was his affection for Jethro\r\nthe old soldier found dependence hard to bear. He never spoke of it to\r\nCynthia, but he used to lie and dream through the spring days of what he\r\nmight have done if the war had not crippled him. For Ephraim Prescott,\r\nlike his grandfather, was a man of action--a keen, intelligent American\r\nwhose energy, under other circumstances, might have gone toward the\r\nmaking of the West. Ephraim, furthermore, had certain principles which\r\nsome in Coniston called cranks; for instance, he would never apply for a\r\npension, though he could easily have obtained one. Through all his\r\ntroubles, he held grimly to the ideal which meant more to him than ease\r\nand comfort,--that he had served his country for the love of it.\r\n\r\nWith the warm weather he was able to be about again, and occasionally to\r\nmend a harness, but Doctor Rowell shook his head when Jethro stopped his\r\nbuggy in the road one day to inquire about Ephraim. Whereupon Jethro went\r\non to the harness shop. The inspiration, by the way, had come from\r\nCynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Er--Ephraim, how'd you like to, be postmaster? H-haven't any objections\r\nto that kind of a job, hev you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why no,\" said Ephraim. \"We hain't agoin' to hev a post-office at\r\nConiston--air we?\"\r\n\r\n\"H-how'd you like to be postmaster at Brampton?\" demanded Jethro,\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\nEphraim dropped the trace he was shaving.\r\n\r\n\"Postmaster at Brampton!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"H-how'd you like it?\" said Jethro again.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Ephraim, \"I hain't got any objections.\"\r\n\r\nJethro started out of the shop, but paused again at the door.\r\n\r\n\"W-won't say nothin' about it, will you, Eph?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Not till I git it,\" answered Ephraim. The sorrows of three years were\r\nsuddenly lifted from his shoulders, and for an instant Ephraim wanted to\r\ndance until he remembered the rheumatism and the Wilderness leg. Suddenly\r\na thought struck him, and he hobbled to the door and called out after\r\nJethro's retreating figure. Jethro returned.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" he said, \"well?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the pay?\" said Ephraim, in a whisper.\r\n\r\nJethro named the sum instantly, also in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"You don't tell me!\" said Ephraim, and sank stupefied into the chair in\r\nfront of the shop, where lately he had spent so much of his time.\r\n\r\nJethro chuckled twice on his way home: he chuckled twice again to\r\nCynthia's delight at supper, and after supper he sent Millicent Skinner\r\nto find Jake Wheeler. Jake as usual, was kicking his heels in front of\r\nthe store, talking to Rias and others about the coming Fourth of July\r\ncelebration at Brampton. Brampton, as we know, was famous for its Fourth\r\nof July celebrations. Not neglecting to let it be known that Jethro had\r\nsent for him, Jake hurried off through the summer twilight to the tannery\r\nhouse, bowed ceremoniously to Cynthia under the butternut tree, and\r\ndiscovered Jethro behind the shed. It was usually Jethro's custom to\r\nallow the other man to begin the conversation, no matter how trivial the\r\nsubject--a method which had commended itself to Mr. Bixby and other minor\r\npoliticians who copied him. And usually the other man played directly\r\ninto Jethro's hands. Jake Wheeler always did, and now, to cover the\r\nawkwardness of the silence, he began on the Brampton celebration.\r\n\r\n\"They tell me Heth Sutton's a-goin' to make the address--seems prouder\r\nthan ever sence he went to Congress. I guess you'll tell him what to say\r\nwhen the time comes, Jethro.\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--goin' to Clovelly after wool this week, Jake?\"\r\n\r\n\"I kin go to-morrow,\" said Jake, scenting an affair.\r\n\r\n\"Er--goin' to Clovelly after wool this week, Jake?\"\r\n\r\nJake reflected. He saw it was expedient that this errand should not smell\r\nof haste.\r\n\r\n\"I was goin' to see Cutter on Friday,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Er--if you should happen to meet Heth--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" interrupted Jake.\r\n\r\n\"If by chance you should happen to meet Heth, or Bije\" (Jethro knew that\r\nJake never went to Clovelly without a conference with one or the other of\r\nthese personages, if only to be able to talk about it afterward at the\r\nstore), \"er--what would you say to 'em?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said Jake, scratching his head for the answer, \"I'd tell him you\r\nwas at Coniston.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think we'll have rain, Jake?\" inquired Jethro, blandly.\r\n\r\nJake wended his way back to the store, filled with renewed admiration for\r\nthe great man. Jethro had given him no instructions whatever, could deny\r\nbefore a jury if need be that he had sent him (Jake) to Clovelly to tell\r\nHeth Sutton to come to Coniston for instructions on the occasion of his\r\nBrampton speech. And Jake was filled with a mysterious importance when he\r\ntook his seat once more in the conclave.\r\n\r\nJake Wheeler, although in many respects a fool, was one of the most\r\nefficient pack of political hounds that the state has ever known. By six\r\no'clock on Friday morning he was descending a brook valley on the\r\nClovelly side of the mountain, and by seven was driving between the\r\nforest and river meadows of the Rajah's domain, and had come in sight of\r\nthe big white house with its somewhat pretentious bay-windows and Gothic\r\ndoorway; it might be dubbed the palace of these parts. The wide river\r\nflowed below it, and the pastures so wondrously green in the morning sun\r\nwere dotted with fat cattle and sheep. Jake was content to borrow a cut\r\nof tobacco from the superintendent and wonder aimlessly around the farm\r\nuntil Mr. Sutton's family prayers and breakfast were accomplished. We\r\nshall not concern ourselves with the message or the somewhat lengthy\r\nmanner in which it was delivered. Jake had merely dropped in by accident,\r\nbut the Rajah listened coldly while he picked his teeth, said he didn't\r\nknow whether he was going to Brampton or not--hadn't decided; didn't know\r\nwhether he could get to Coniston or not--his affairs were multitudinous\r\nnow. In short, he set Jake to thinking deeply as his horse walked up the\r\nwestern heights of Coniston on the return journey. He had, let it be\r\nrepeated, a sure instinct once his nose was fairly on the scent, and he\r\nwas convinced that a war of great magnitude was in the air, and he; Jake\r\nWheeler, was probably the first in all the elate to discover it! His\r\nblood leaped at the thought.\r\n\r\nThe hill-Rajah's defiance, boiled down, could only mean one thing,--that\r\nsomebody with sufficient power and money was about to lock horns with\r\nJethro Bass. Not for a moment did Jake believe that, for all his pomp and\r\ncircumstance, the Honorable Heth Sutton was a big enough man to do this.\r\nJake paid to the Honorable Heth all the outward respect that his high\r\nposition demanded, but he knew the man through and through. He thought of\r\nthe Honorable Heth's reform speech in Congress, and laughed loudly in the\r\nechoing woods. No, Mr. Sutton was not the man to lead a fight. But to\r\nwhom had he promised his allegiance? This question puzzled Mr. Wheeler\r\nall the way home, and may it be said finally for many days thereafter. He\r\nslid into Coniston in the dusk, big with impending events, which he could\r\nnot fathom. As to giving Jethro the careless answer of the hill-Rajah,\r\nthat was another matter.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth of July came at last, nor was any contradiction made in the\r\nBrampton papers that the speech of the Honorable Heth Sutton had been\r\ncancelled. Instead, advertisements appeared in the 'Brampton Clarion'\r\nannouncing the fact in large letters. When Cynthia read this\r\nadvertisement to Jethro, he chuckled again. They were under the butternut\r\ntree, for the evenings were long now.\r\n\r\n\"Will you take me to Brampton, Uncle Jethro?\" said she, letting fall the\r\npaper on her lap.\r\n\r\n\"W-who's to get in the hay?\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Hay on the Fourth of July!\" exclaimed Cynthia, \"why, that's--sacrilege!\r\nYou'd much better come and hear Mr. Sutton's speech--it will do you\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia could see that Jethro was intensely amused, for his eyes had a\r\nway of snapping on such occasions when he was alone with her. She was\r\npuzzled and slightly offended, because, to tell the truth, Jethro had\r\nspoiled her.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then,\" she said, \"I'll go with the Painter-man.\"\r\n\r\nJethro came and stood over her, his expression the least bit wistful.\r\n\r\n\"Er--Cynthy,\" he said presently, \"hain't fond of that Painter-man, be\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes,\" said Cynthia, \"aren't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's fond of you,\" said Jethro, \"sh-shouldn't be surprised if he was in\r\nlove with you.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia looked up at him, the corners of her mouth twitching, and then\r\nshe laughed. The Rev. Mr. Satterlee, writing his Sunday sermon in his\r\nstudy, heard her and laid down his pen to listen.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro,\" said Cynthia, \"sometimes I forget that you're a great,\r\nwise man, and I think that you are just a silly old goose.\"\r\n\r\nJethro wiped his face with his blue cotton handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\"Then you hain't a-goin' to marry the Painter-man?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to marry anybody,\" cried Cynthia, contritely; \"I'm going\r\nto live with you and take care of you all my life.\"\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the Fourth, Cynthia drove to Brampton with the\r\nPainter-man, and when he perceived that she was dreaming, he ceased to\r\nworry her with his talk. He liked her dreaming, and stole many glances at\r\nher face of which she knew nothing at all. Through the cool and fragrant\r\nwoods, past the mill-pond stained blue and white by the sky, and scented\r\nclover fields and wayside flowers nodding in the morning air--Cynthia saw\r\nthese things in the memory of another journey to Brampton. On that Fourth\r\nher father had been with her, and Jethro and Ephraim and Moses and Amanda\r\nHatch and the children. And how well she recalled, too, standing amidst\r\nthe curious crowd before the great house which Mr. Worthington had just\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\nThere are weeks and months, perhaps, when we do not think of people, when\r\nour lives are full and vigorous, and then perchance a memory will bring\r\nthem vividly before us--so vividly that we yearn for them. There rose\r\nbefore Cynthia now the vision of a boy as he stood on the Gothic porch of\r\nthe house, and how he had come down to the wondering country people with\r\nhis smile and his merry greeting, and how he had cajoled her into\r\nlingering in front of the meeting-house. Had he forgotten her? With just\r\na suspicion of a twinge, Cynthia remembered that Janet Duncan she had\r\nseen at the capital, whom she had been told was the heiress of the state.\r\nWhen he had graduated from Harvard, Bob would, of course, marry her. That\r\nwas in the nature of things.\r\n\r\nTo some the great event of that day in Brampton was to be the speech of\r\nthe Honorable Heth Sutton in the meeting-house at eleven; others (and\r\nthis party was quite as numerous) had looked forward to the base-ball\r\ngame between Brampton and Harwich in the afternoon. The painter would\r\nhave preferred to walk up meeting-house hill with Cynthia, and from the\r\ncool heights look down upon the amphitheatre in which the town was built.\r\nBut Cynthia was interested in history, and they went to the meeting-house\r\naccordingly, where she listened for an hour and a half to the patriotic\r\neloquence of the representative. The painter was glad to see and hear so\r\ngreat a man in the hour of his glory, though so much as a fragment of the\r\noration does not now remain in his memory. In size, in figure, in\r\nexpression, in the sonorous tones of his voice, Mr. Sutton was everything\r\nthat a congressman should be. \"The people,\" said Isaac D. Worthington in\r\npresenting him, \"should indeed be proud of such an able and high-minded\r\nrepresentative.\" We shall have cause to recall that word high-minded.\r\n\r\nMany persons greeted Cynthia outside the meetinghouse, for the girl\r\nseemed genuinely loved by all who knew her--too much loved, her companion\r\nthought, by certain spick-and-span young men of Brampton. But they ate\r\nthe lunch Cynthia had brought, far from the crowd, under the trees by\r\nConiston Water. It was she who proposed going to the base-ball game, and\r\nthe painter stifled a sigh and acquiesced. Their way brought them down\r\nBrampton Street, past a house with great iron dogs on the lawn, so\r\nimposing and cityfied that he hung back and asked who lived there.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Worthington,\" answered Cynthia, making to move on impatiently.\r\n\r\nHer escort did not think much of the house, but it interested him as the\r\ntype which Mr. Worthington had built. On that same Gothic porch,\r\nsublimely unconscious of the covert stares and subdued comments of the\r\npassers-by, the first citizen himself and the Honorable Heth Sutton might\r\nbe seen. Mr. Worthington, whose hawklike look had become more pronounced,\r\nsat upright, while the Honorable Heth, his legs crossed, filled every\r\nnook and cranny of an arm-chair, and an occasional fragrant whiff from\r\nhis cigar floated out to those on the tar sidewalk. Although the\r\npedestrians were but twenty feet away, what Mr. Worthington said never\r\nreached them; but the Honorable Heth on public days carried his voice of\r\nthe Forum around with him.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" said Cynthia, in one of those startling little tempers she was\r\nsubject to; \"don't stand there like an idiot.\"\r\n\r\nThen the voice of Mr. Sutton boomed toward them.\r\n\r\n\"As I understand, Worthington,\" they heard him say, \"you want me to\r\nappoint young Wheelock for the Brampton post-office.\" He stuck his thumb\r\ninto his vest pocket and recrossed his legs \"I guess it can be arranged.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the painter at last overtook Cynthia the jewel paints he had so\r\noften longed to catch upon a canvas were in her eyes. He fell back,\r\nwondering how he could so greatly have offended, when she put her hand on\r\nhis sleeve.\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear what he said about the Brampton postoffice?\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"The Brampton post-office?\" he repeated; dazed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Cynthia; \"Uncle Jethro has promised it to Cousin Ephraim, who\r\nwill starve without it. Did you hear this man say he would give it to Mr.\r\nWheelock?\"\r\n\r\nHere was a new Cynthia, aflame with emotions on a question of politics of\r\nwhich he knew nothing. He did, understand, however, her concern for\r\nEphraim Prescott, for he knew that she loved the soldier. She turned from\r\nthe painter now with a gesture which he took to mean that his profession\r\ndebarred him from such vital subjects, and she led the way to the\r\nfair-grounds. There he meekly bought tickets, and they found themselves\r\nhurried along in the eager crowd toward the stand.\r\n\r\nThe girl was still unaccountably angry over that mysterious affair of the\r\npost-office, and sat with flushed cheeks staring out on the green field,\r\npast the line of buggies and carryalls on the farther side to the\r\nsouthern shoulder of Coniston towering, above them all. The painter,\r\nalready, beginning to love his New England folk, listened to the homely\r\nchatter about him, until suddenly a cheer starting in one corner ran like\r\na flash of gunpowder around the field, and eighteen young men trotted\r\nacross the turf. Although he was not a devotee of sport, he noticed that\r\nnine of these, as they took their places on the bench, wore blue,--the\r\nHarwich Champions. Seven only of those scattering over the field wore\r\nwhite; two young gentlemen, one at second base and the other behind the\r\nbatter, wore gray uniforms with crimson stockings, and crimson piping on\r\nthe caps, and a crimson H embroidered on the breast--a sight that made\r\nthe painter's heart beat a little faster, the honored livery of his own\r\ncollege.\r\n\r\n\"What are those two Harvard men doing here?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nCynthia, who was leaning forward, started, and turned to him a face which\r\nshowed him that his question had been meaningless. He repeated it.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said she, \"the tall one, burned brick-red like an Indian, is Bob\r\nWorthington.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a good type,\" the artist remarked.\r\n\r\n\"You're right, Mister, there hain't a finer young feller anywhere,\"\r\nchimed in Mr. Dodd, a portly person with a tuft of yellow beard on his\r\nchin. Mr. Dodd kept the hardware store in Brampton.\r\n\r\n\"And who,\" asked the painter, \"is the bullet-headed little fellow, with\r\nfreckles and short red hair, behind the bat?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Cynthia, indifferently.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" exclaimed Mr. Dodd, with just a trace of awe in his voice, \"that's\r\nSomers Duncan, son of Millionaire Duncan down to the capital. I guess,\"\r\nhe added, \"I guess them two will be the richest men in the state some\r\nday. Duncan come up from Harvard with Bob.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the game was in full swing, Brampton against Harwich,\r\nthe old rivalry in another form. Every advantage on either side awoke\r\nthundering cheers from the partisans; beribboned young women sprang to\r\ntheir feet and waved the Harwich blue at a home run, and were on the\r\nverge of tears when the Brampton pitcher struck out their best batsman.\r\nBut beyond the facts that the tide was turning in Brampton's favor; that\r\nyoung Mr. Worthington stopped a ball flying at a phenomenal speed and\r\nbatted another at a still more phenomenal speed which was not stopped;\r\nthat his name and Duncan's were mingled generously in the cheering, the\r\npainter remembered little of the game. The exhibition of human passions\r\nwhich the sight of it drew from an undemonstrative race: the shouting,\r\nthe comments wrung from hardy spirits off their guard, the joy and the\r\nsorrow,--such things interested him more. High above the turmoil\r\nConiston, as through the ages, looked down upon the scene impassive.\r\n\r\nHe was aroused from these reflections by an incident. Some one had leaped\r\nover the railing which separated the stand from the field and stood\r\nbefore Cynthia,--a tanned and smiling young man in gray and crimson. His\r\nhonest eyes were alight with an admiration that was unmistakable to the\r\npainter--perhaps to Cynthia also, for a glow that might have been of\r\nannoyance or anger, and yet was like the color of the mountain sunrise,\r\nanswered in her cheek. Mr. Worthington reached out a large brown hand and\r\nseized the girl's as it lay on her lap.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Cynthia,\" he cried, \"I've been looking for you all day. I thought\r\nyou might be here. Where were you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you look?\" answered Cynthia, composedly, withdrawing her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Everywhere,\" said Bob, \"up and down the street, all through the hotel. I\r\nasked Lem Hallowell, and he didn't know where you were. I only got here\r\nlast night myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was in the meeting-house,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"The meeting-house!\" he echoed. \"You don't mean to tell me that you\r\nlistened to that silly speech of Sutton's?\"\r\n\r\nThis remark, delivered in all earnestness, was the signal for uproarious\r\nlaughter from Mr. Dodd and others sitting near by, attending earnestly to\r\nthe conversation.\r\n\r\nCynthia bit her lip.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did,\" she said; \"but I'm sorry now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think you would be,\" said Bob; \"Sutton's a silly, pompous old\r\nfool. I had to sit through dinner with him. I believe I could represent\r\nthe district better myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"By gosh!\" exploded Mr. Dodd, \"I believe you could!\"\r\n\r\nBut Bob paid no attention to him. He was looking at Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia, you've grown up since I saw you,\" he said. \"How's Uncle Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"He's well--thanks,\" said Cynthia, and now she was striving to put down a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"Still running the state?\" said Bob. \"You tell him I think he ought to\r\nmuzzle Sutton. What did he send him down to Washington for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do after the game?\" Bob demanded.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going home of course,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\nHis face fell.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you come to the house for supper and stay for the fireworks?\" he\r\nbegged pleadingly. \"We'd be mighty glad to have your friend, too.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia introduced her escort.\r\n\r\n\"It's very good of you, Bob,\" she said, with that New England demureness\r\nwhich at times became her so well, \"but we couldn't possibly do it. And\r\nthen I don't like Mr. Sutton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hang him!\" exclaimed Bob. He took a step nearer to her. \"Won't you\r\nstay this once? I have to go West in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you are very lucky,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\nBob scanned her face searchingly, and his own fell.\r\n\r\n\"Lucky!\" he cried, \"I think it's the worst thing that ever happened to\r\nme. My father's so hard-headed when he gets his mind set--he's making me\r\ndo it. He wants me to see the railroads and the country, so I've got to\r\ngo with the Duncans. I wanted to stay--\" He checked himself, \"I think\r\nit's a blamed nuisance.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I,\" said a voice behind him.\r\n\r\nIt was not the first time that Mr. Somers Duncan had spoken, but Bob\r\neither had not heard him or pretended not to. Mr. Duncan's freckled face\r\nsmiled at them from the top of the railing, his eyes were on Cynthia's\r\nface, and he had been listening eagerly. Mr. Duncan's chief\r\ncharacteristic, beyond his freckles, was his eagerness--a quality\r\nprobably amounting to keenness.\r\n\r\n\"Hello,\" said Bob, turning impatiently, \"I might have known you couldn't\r\nkeep away. You're the cause of all my troubles--you and your father's\r\nprivate car.\"\r\n\r\nSomers became apologetic.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't my fault,\" he said; \"I'm sure I hate going as much as you do.\r\nIt's spoiled my summer, too.\"\r\n\r\nThen he coughed and looked at Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Bob, \"I suppose I'll have to introduce you. This,\" he added,\r\ndragging his friend over the railing, \"is Mr. Somers Duncan.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm awfully glad to meet you, Miss. Wetherell,\" said Somers, fervently;\r\n\"to tell you the truth, I thought he was just making up yarns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yarns?\" repeated Cynthia, with a look that set Mr. Duncan floundering.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes,\" he stammered. \"Worthy said that you were up here, but I\r\nthought he was crazy the way he talked--I didn't think--\"\r\n\r\n\"Think what?\" inquired Cynthia, but she flushed a little.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, rot, Somers!\" said Bob, blushing furiously under his tan; \"you ought\r\nnever to go near a woman--you're the darndest fool with 'em I ever saw.\"\r\n\r\nThis time even the painter laughed outright, and yet he was a little\r\nsorrowful, too, because he could not be even as these youths. But Cynthia\r\nsat serene, the eternal feminine of all the ages, and it is no wonder\r\nthat Bob Worthington was baffled as he looked at her. He lapsed into an\r\nawkwardness quite as bad as that of his friend.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you enjoyed the game,\" he said at last, with a formality that was\r\nnot at all characteristic.\r\n\r\nCynthia did not seem to think it worth while to answer this, so the\r\npainter tried to help him out.\r\n\r\n\"That was a fine stop you made, Mr. Worthington,\" he said; \"wasn't it,\r\nCynthia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everybody seemed to think so,\" answered Cynthia, cruelly; \"but if I were\r\na man and had hands like that\" (Bob thrust them in his pockets), \"I\r\nbelieve I could stop a ball, too.\"\r\n\r\nSomers laughed uproariously.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by,\" said Bob, with uneasy abruptness, \"I've got to go into the\r\nfield now. When can I see you?\"\r\n\r\n\"When you get back from the West--perhaps,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" cried Bob (they were calling him), \"I must see you to-night!\" He\r\nvaulted over the railing and turned. \"I'll come back here right after the\r\ngame,\" he said; \"there's only one more inning.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll come back right after the game,\" repeated Mr. Duncan.\r\n\r\nBob shot one look at him,--of which Mr. Duncan seemed blissfully\r\nunconscious,--and stalked off abruptly to second base.\r\n\r\nThe artist sat pensive for a few moments, wondering at the ways of women,\r\nhis sympathies unaccountably enlisted in behalf of Mr. Worthington.\r\n\r\n\"Weren't you a little hard on him?\" he said.\r\n\r\nFor answer Cynthia got to her feet.\r\n\r\n\"I think we ought to be going home,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Going home!\" he ejaculated in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"I promised Uncle Jethro I'd be there for supper,\" and she led the way\r\nout of the grand stand.\r\n\r\nSo they drove back to Coniston through the level evening light, and when\r\nthey came to Ephraim Prescott's harness shop the old soldier waved at\r\nthem cheerily from under the big flag which he had hung out in honor of\r\nthe day. The flag was silk, and incidentally Ephraim's most valued\r\npossession. Then they drew up before the tannery house, and Cynthia\r\nleaped out of the buggy and held out her hand to the painter with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"It was very good of you to take me,\" she said.\r\n\r\nJethro Bass, rugged, uncouth, in rawhide boots and swallowtail and\r\ncoonskin cap, came down from the porch to welcome her, and she ran toward\r\nhim with an eagerness that started the painter to wondering afresh over\r\nthe contrasts of life. What, he asked himself, had Fate in store for\r\nCynthia Wetherell?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\"H-have a good time, Cynthy?\" said Jethro, looking down into her face.\r\nLove had wrought changes in Jethro; mightier changes than he suspected,\r\nand the girl did not know how zealous were the sentries of that love, how\r\nwatchful they were, and how they told him often and again whether her\r\nheart, too, was smiling.\r\n\r\n\"It was very gay,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"P-painter-man gay?\" inquired Jethro.\r\n\r\nCynthia's eyes were on the orange line of the sunset over Coniston, but\r\nshe laughed a little, indulgently.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--that Painter-man hain't such a bad fellow--w-why didn't you ask him\r\nin to supper?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you three guesses,\" said Cynthia, but she did not wait for\r\nthem. \"It was because I wanted to be alone with you. Milly's gone out,\r\nhasn't she?\"\r\n\r\n\"G-gone a-courtin',\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\nShe smiled, and went into the house to see whether Milly had done her\r\nduty before she left. It was characteristic of Cynthia not to have\r\nmentioned the subject which was agitating her mind until they were seated\r\non opposite sides of the basswood table.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro,\" she said, \"I thought you told Mr. Sutton to give Cousin\r\nEph the Brampton post-office? Do you trust Mr. Sutton?\" she demanded\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n\"Er--why?\" said Jethro. \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I don't,\" she answered with conviction; \"I think he's a big\r\nfraud. He must have deceived you, Uncle Jethro. I can't see why you ever\r\nsent him to Congress.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Jethro was in no mood for mirth, he laughed in spite of himself,\r\nfor he was an American. His lifelong habit would have made him defend\r\nHeth to any one but Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"'D you see Heth, Cynthy?\" he asked.\r\n \"Yes,\" replied the girl, disgustedly, \"I should say I did, but not to\r\nspeak to him. He was sitting on Mr. Worthington's porch, and I heard him\r\ntell Mr. Worthington he would give the Brampton post-office to Dave\r\nWheelock. I don't want you to think that I was eavesdropping,\" she added\r\nquickly; \"I couldn't help hearing it.\"\r\n\r\nJethro did not answer.\r\n\r\n\"You'll make him give the post-office to Cousin Eph, won't you, Uncle\r\nJethro?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes;\" said Jethro, very simply, \"I will.\" He meditated awhile, and then\r\nsaid suddenly, \"W-won't speak about it--will you, Cynthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know I won't,\" she answered.\r\n\r\nLet it not be thought by any chance that Coniston was given over to\r\nrevelry and late hours, even on the Fourth of July. By ten o'clock the\r\nlights were out in the tannery house, but Cynthia was not asleep. She sat\r\nat her window watching the shy moon peeping over Coniston ridge, and she\r\nwas thinking, to be exact, of how much could happen in one short day and\r\nhow little in a long month. She was aroused by the sound of wheels and\r\nthe soft beat of a horse's hoofs on the dirt road: then came stifled\r\nlaughter, and suddenly she sprang up alert and tingling. Her own name\r\ncame floating to her through the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe next thing that happened will be long remembered in Coniston. A\r\ntentative chord or two from a guitar, and then the startled village was\r\nlistening with all its might to the voices of two young men singing \"When\r\nI first went up to Harvard\"--probably meant to disclose the identity of\r\nthe serenaders, as if that were necessary! Coniston, never having\r\nlistened to grand opera, was entertained and thrilled, and thought the\r\nrendering of the song better on the whole than the church choir could\r\nhave done it, or even the quartette that sung at the Brampton\r\ncelebrations behind the flowers. Cynthia had her own views on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThere were five other songs--Cynthia remembers all of them, although she\r\nwould not confess such a thing. \"Naughty, naughty Clara,\" was another\r\none; the other three were almost wholly about love, some treating it\r\nflippantly, others seriously--this applied to the last one, which had\r\nmany farewells in it. Then they went away, and the crickets and frogs on\r\nConiston Water took up the refrain.\r\n\r\nAlthough the occurrence was unusual,--it might almost be said\r\nepoch-making,--Jethro did not speak of it until they had reached the\r\nsparkling heights of Thousand Acre Hill the next morning. Even then he\r\ndid not look at Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Know who that was last night, Cynthy?\" he inquired, as though the matter\r\nwere a casual one.\r\n\r\n\"I believe,\" said Cynthia heroically, \"I believe it was a boy named\r\nSomers Duncan-and Bob Worthington.\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--Bob Worthington,\" repeated Jethro, but said nothing more.\r\n\r\nOf course Coniston, and presently Brampton, knew that Bob Worthington had\r\nserenaded Cynthia--and Coniston and Brampton talked. It is noteworthy\r\nthat (with the jocular exceptions of Ephraim and Lem Hallowell) they did\r\nnot talk to the girl herself. The painter had long ago discovered that\r\nCynthia was an individual. She had good blood in her: as a mere child she\r\nhad shouldered the responsibility of her father; she had a natural\r\naptitude for books--a quality reverenced in the community; she visited,\r\nas a matter of habit; the sick and the unfortunate; and lastly (perhaps\r\nthe crowning achievement) she had bound Jethro Bass, of all men, with the\r\nfetters of love. Of course I have ended up by making her a paragon,\r\nalthough I am merely stating what people thought of her. Coniston decided\r\nat once that she was to marry the heir to the Brampton Mills.\r\n\r\nBut the heir had gone West, and as the summer wore on, the gossip died\r\ndown. Other and more absorbing gossip took its place: never distinctly\r\nformulated, but whispered; always wishing for more definite news that\r\nnever came. The statesmen drove out from Brampton to the door of the\r\ntannery house, as usual, only it was remarked by astute observers and\r\nJake Wheeler that certain statesmen did not come who had been in the\r\nhabit of coming formerly. In short, those who made it a custom to observe\r\nsuch matters felt vaguely a disturbance of some kind. The organs of the\r\npeople felt it, and became more guarded in their statements. What no one\r\nknew, except Jake and a few in high places, was that a war of no mean\r\nmagnitude was impending.\r\n\r\nThere were three men in the State--and perhaps only three--who realized\r\nfrom the first that all former political combats would pale in comparison\r\nto this one to come. Similar wars had already started in other states,\r\nand when at length they were fought out another twist had been given to\r\nthe tail of a long-suffering Constitution; political history in the\r\nUnited States had to be written from an entirely new and unforeseen\r\nstandpoint, and the unsuspecting people had changed masters.\r\n\r\nThis was to be a war of extermination of one side or the other. No\r\nquarter would be given or asked, and every weapon hitherto known to\r\npolitics would be used. Of the three men who realized this, and all that\r\nwould happen if one side or the other were victorious, one was Alexander\r\nDuncan, another Isaac D. Worthington, and the third was Jethro Bass.\r\n\r\nJethro would never have been capable of being master of the state had he\r\nnot foreseen the time when the railroads, tired of paying tribute, would\r\nturn and try to exterminate the boss. The really astonishing thing about\r\nJethro's foresight (known to few only) was that he perceived clearly that\r\nthe time would come when the railroads and other aggregations of capital\r\nwould exterminate the boss, or at least subserviate him. This alone, the\r\nwriter thinks, gives him some right to greatness. And Jethro Bass made up\r\nhis mind that the victory of the railroads, in his state at least, should\r\nnot come in his day. He would hold and keep what he had fought all his\r\nlife to gain.\r\n\r\nJethro knew, when Jake Wheeler failed to bring him a message back from\r\nClovelly, that the war had begun, and that Isaac D. Worthington,\r\ncommander of the railroad forces in the field, had captured his pawn, the\r\nhill-Rajah. By getting through to Harwich, the Truro had made a sad\r\nmuddle in railroad affairs. It was now a connecting link; and its\r\npresident, the first citizen of Brampton, a man of no small importance in\r\nthe state. This fact was not lost upon Jethro, who perceived clearly\r\nenough the fight for consolidation that was coming in the next\r\nLegislature.\r\n\r\nSeated on an old haystack on Thousand Acre Hill, that sits in turn on the\r\nlap of Coniston, Jethro smiled as he reflected that the first trial of\r\nstrength in this mighty struggle was to be over (what the unsuspecting\r\nworld would deem a trivial matter) the postmastership of Brampton. And\r\nWorthington's first move in the game would be to attempt to capture for\r\nhis faction the support of the Administration itself.\r\n\r\nJethro thought the view from Thousand Acre Hill, especially in September,\r\nto be one of the sublimest efforts of the Creator. It was September,\r\nfirst of the purple months in Coniston, not the red-purple of the Maine\r\ncoast, but the blue-purple of the mountain, the color of the bloom on the\r\nConcord grape. His eyes, sweeping the mountain from the notch to the\r\ngranite ramp of the northern buttress, fell on the weather-beaten little\r\nfarmhouse in which he had lived for many years, and rested lovingly on\r\nthe orchard, where the golden early apples shone among the leaves. But\r\nJethro was not looking at the apples.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthy,\" he called out abruptly, \"h-how'd you like to go to Washington?\"\r\n\r\n\"Washington!\" exclaimed Cynthia. \"When?\"\r\n\r\n\"N-now--to-morrow.\" Then he added uneasily, \"C-can't you get ready?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I'll go to-night, Uncle Jethro,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said admiringly, \"you hain't one of them clutterin' females.\r\nWe can get some finery for you in New York, Cynthy. D-don't want any of\r\nthem town ladies to put you to shame. Er--not that they would,\" he added\r\nhastily--\"not that they would.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia climbed up beside him on the haystack.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro,\" she said solemnly, \"when you make a senator or a judge, I\r\ndon't interfere, do I?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her uneasily, for there were moments when he could not for\r\nthe life of him make out her drift.\r\n\r\n\"N-no,\" he assented, \"of course not, Cynthy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why is it that I don't interfere?\"\r\n\r\n\"I callate,\" answered Jethro, still more uneasily, \"I callate it's\r\nbecause you're a woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"And don't you think,\" asked Cynthia, \"that a woman ought to know what\r\nbecomes her best?\"\r\n\r\nJethro reflected, and then his glance fell on her approvingly.\r\n\r\n\"G-guess you're right, Cynthy,\" he said. \"I always had some success in\r\ndressin' up Listy, and that kind of set me up.\"\r\n\r\nOn such occasions he spoke of his wife quite simply. He had been\r\ngenuinely fond of her, although she was no more than an episode in his\r\nlife. Cynthia smiled to herself as they walked through the orchard to the\r\nplace where the horse was tied, but she was a little remorseful. This\r\nfeeling, on the drive homeward, was swept away by sheer elation at the\r\nprospect of the trip before her. She had often dreamed of the great world\r\nbeyond Coniston, and no one, not even Jethro, had guessed the longings to\r\nsee it which had at times beset her. Often she had dropped her book to\r\nsummon up a picture of what a great city was like, to reconstruct the\r\nBoston of her early childhood. She remembered the Mall, where she used to\r\nwalk with her father, and the row of houses where the rich dwelt, which\r\nhad seemed like palaces. Indeed, when she read of palaces, these houses\r\nalways came to her mind. And now she was to behold a palace even greater\r\nthan these,--and the house where the President himself dwelt. But why was\r\nJethro going to Washington?\r\n\r\nAs if in answer to the question, he drove directly to the harness shop\r\ninstead of to the tannery house. Ephraim greeted them from within with a\r\ncheery hail, and hobbled out and stood between the wheels of the buggy.\r\n\r\n\"That bridle bust again?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Er--Ephraim,\" said Jethro, \"how long since you b'en away from\r\nConiston--how long?\"\r\n\r\nEphraim reflected.\r\n\r\n\"I went to Harwich with Moses before that bad spell I had in March,\" he\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nCynthia smiled from pure happiness, for she began to see the drift of\r\nthings now.\r\n\r\n\"H-how long since you've b'en in foreign parts?\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"'Sixty-five,\" answered Ephraim, with astonishing promptness.\r\n\r\n\"Er--like to go to Washington with us to-morrow like to go to\r\nWashington?\"\r\n\r\nEphraim gasped, even as Cynthia had.\r\n\r\n\"Washin'ton!\" he ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthy and I was thinkin' of takin' a little trip,\" said Jethro, almost\r\napologetically, \"and we kind of thought we'd like to have you with us.\r\nDidn't we, Cynthy? Er--we might see General Grant,\" he added meaningly.\r\n\r\nEphraim was a New Englander, and not an adept in expressing his emotions.\r\nBoth Cynthia and Jethro felt that he would have liked to have said\r\nsomething appropriate if he had known how. What he actually said\r\nwas:--\"What time to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"C-callate to take the nine o'clock from Brampton,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"I'll report for duty at seven,\" said Ephraim, and it was then he\r\nsqueezed the hand that he found in his. He watched them calmly enough\r\nuntil they had disappeared in the barn behind the tannery house, and\r\nthen his thoughts became riotous. Rumors had been rife that summer,\r\nprophecies of changes to come, and the resignation of the old man who had\r\nso long been postmaster at Brampton was freely discussed--or rather the\r\nmatter of his successor. As the months passed, Ephraim had heard David\r\nWheelock mentioned with more and more assurance for the place. He had had\r\nmany nights when sleep failed him, but it was characteristic of the old\r\nsoldier that he had never once broached the subject since Jethro had\r\nspoken to him two months before. Ephraim had even looked up the law to\r\nsee if he was eligible, and found that he was, since Coniston had no\r\npost-office, and was within the limits of delivery of the Brampton\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Coniston was treated to a genuine surprise. After\r\nloading up at the store, Lem Hallowell, instead of heading for Brampton,\r\ndrove to the tannery house, left his horses standing as he ran in, and\r\npresently emerged with a little cowhide trunk that bore the letter W.\r\nFollowing the trunk came a radiant Cynthia, following Cynthia, Jethro\r\nBass in a stove-pipe hat, with a carpetbag, and hobbling after Jethro,\r\nEphraim Prescott, with another carpet-bag. It was remarked in the buzz of\r\nquery that followed the stage's departure that Ephraim wore the blue suit\r\nand the army hat with a cord around it which he kept for occasions.\r\nConiston longed to follow them, in spirit at least, but even Milly\r\nSkinner did not know their destination.\r\n\r\nFortunately we can follow them. At Brampton station they got into the\r\nlittle train that had just come over Truro Pass, and steamed, with many\r\nstops, down the valley of Coniston Water until it stretched out into a\r\nwide range of shimmering green meadows guarded by blue hills veiled in\r\nthe morning haze. Then, bustling Harwich, and a wait of half an hour\r\nuntil the express from the north country came thundering through the Gap;\r\nthen a five-hours' journey down the broad river that runs southward\r\nbetween the hills, dinner in a huge station amidst a pleasant buzz of\r\nexcitement and the ringing of many bells. Then into another train,\r\nthrough valleys and factory towns and cities until they came, at\r\nnightfall, to the metropolis itself.\r\n\r\nCynthia will always remember the awe with which that first view of New\r\nYork inspired her, and Ephraim confessed that he, too, had felt it, when\r\nhe had first seen the myriad lights of the city after the long, dusty\r\nride from the hills with his regiment. For all the flags and bunting it\r\nhad held in '61, Ephraim thought that city crueller than war itself. And\r\nCynthia thought so too, as she clung to Jethro's arm between the\r\ncarriages and the clanging street-cars, and looked upon the riches and\r\npoverty around her. There entered her soul that night a sense of that\r\nwhich is the worst cruelty of all--the cruelty of selfishness. Every man\r\ngoing his own pace, seeking to gratify his own aims and desires,\r\nunconscious and heedless of the want with which he rubs elbows. Her\r\nnatural imagination enhanced by her life among the hills, the girl\r\npeopled the place in the street lights with all kinds of strange\r\nevil-doers of whose sins she knew nothing, adventurers, charlatans, alert\r\ncormorants, who preyed upon the unwary. She shrank closer to Ephraim from\r\na perfumed lady who sat next to her in the car, and was thankful when at\r\nlast they found themselves in the corridor of the Astor House standing\r\nbefore the desk.\r\n\r\nHotel clerks, especially city ones, are supernatural persons. This one\r\nknew Jethro, greeted him deferentially as Judge Bass, and dipped the pen\r\nin the ink and handed it to him that he might register. By half-past nine\r\nCynthia was dreaming of Lem Hallowell and Coniston, and Lem was driving a\r\nyellow street-car full of queer people down the road to Brampton.\r\n\r\nThere were few guests in the great dining room when they breakfasted at\r\nseven the next morning. New York, in the sunlight, had taken on a more\r\nkindly expression, and those who were near by smiled at them and seemed\r\nfull of good-will. Persons smiled at them that day as they walked the\r\nstreets or stood spellbound before the shop windows, and some who saw\r\nthem felt a lump rise in their throats at the memories they aroused of\r\nforgotten days: the three seemed to bring the very air of the hills with\r\nthem into that teeming place, and many who, had come to the city with\r\nhigh hopes, now in the shackles of drudgery; looked after them. They were\r\na curious party, indeed: the straight, dark girl with the light in her\r\neyes and the color in her cheeks; the quaint, rugged figure of the\r\nelderly man in his swallow-tail and brass buttons and square-toed,\r\ncountry boots; and the old soldier hobbling along with the aid of his\r\ngreen umbrella, clad in the blue he had loved and suffered for. Had they\r\nremained until Sunday, they might have read an amusing account of their\r\nvisit,--of Jethro's suppers of crackers and milk at the Astor House, of\r\ntheir progress along Broadway. The story was not lacking in pathos,\r\neither, and in real human feeling, for the young reporter who wrote it\r\nhad come, not many years before, from the hills himself. But by that time\r\nthey had accomplished another marvellous span in their journey, and were\r\ncome to Washington itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCynthia was deprived, too, of that thrilling first view of the capital\r\nfrom the train which she had pictured, for night had fallen when they\r\nreached Washington likewise. As the train slowed down, she leaned a\r\nlittle out of the window and looked at the shabby houses and shabby\r\nstreets revealed by the flickering lights in the lamp-posts. Finally they\r\ncame to a shabby station, were seized upon by a grinning darky hackman,\r\nwho would not take no for an answer, and were rattled away to the hotel.\r\nAlthough he had been to Washington but once in his life before, as a\r\nLincoln elector, Jethro was greeted as an old acquaintance by this clerk\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n\"Glad to see you, Judge,\" said he, genially. \"Train late? You've come\r\npurty nigh, missin' supper.\"\r\n\r\nA familiar of great men, the clerk was not offended when he got no\r\nresponse to his welcome. Cynthia and Ephraim, intent on getting rid\r\nof some of the dust of their journey, followed the colored hallboy\r\nup the stairs. Jethro stood poring over the register, when a\r\ndistinguished-looking elderly gentleman with a heavy gray beard and eyes\r\nfull of shrewdness and humor paused at the desk to ask a question.\r\n\r\n\"Er--Senator?\"\r\n\r\nThe senator (for such he was, although he did not represent Jethro's\r\nstate) turned and stared, and then held out his hand with unmistakable\r\nwarmth.\r\n\r\n\"Jethro Bass,\" he exclaimed, \"upon my word! What are you doing in\r\nWashington?\"\r\n\r\nJethro took the hand, but he did not answer the question.\r\n\r\n\"Er--Senator--when can I see the President?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" answered the senator, somewhat taken aback, \"why, to-night, if you\r\nlike. I'm going to the White House in a few minutes and I think I can\r\narrange it.\"\r\n\r\n\"T-to-morrow afternoon--t-to-morrow afternoon?\"\r\n\r\nThe senator cast his eye over the swallow-tail coat and stove-pipe hat\r\ntilted back, and laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Thunder!\" he exclaimed, \"you haven't changed a bit. I'm beginning to\r\nlook like an old man; but that milk-and-crackers diet seems to keep you\r\nyoung, Jethro. I'll fix it for to-morrow afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"W-what time--two?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll fix it for two to-morrow afternoon. I never could understand\r\nyou, Jethro; you don't do things like other men. Do I smell gunpowder?\r\nWhat's up now--what do you want to see Grant about?\"\r\n\r\nJethro cast his eye around the corridor, where a few men were taking\r\ntheir ease after supper, and looked at the senator mysteriously.\r\n\r\n\"Any place where we can talk?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"We can go into the writing room and shut the door,\" answered the\r\nsenator, more amused than ever.\r\n\r\nWhen Cynthia came downstairs, Jethro was standing with the gentleman in\r\nthe corridor leading to the dining room, and she heard the gentleman say\r\nas he took his departure:--\"I haven't forgotten what you did for us in\r\n'70, Jethro. I'll go right along and see to it now.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia liked the gentleman's looks, and rightly surmised that he was one\r\nof the big men of the nation. She was about to ask Jethro his name when\r\nEphraim came limping along and put the matter out of her mind, and the\r\nthree went into the almost empty dining room. There they were served with\r\nelaborate attention by a darky waiter who had, in some mysterious way,\r\nlearned Jethro's name and title. Cynthia reflected with pride that\r\nJethro, too, was one of the nation's great men, who could get anything he\r\nwanted simply by coming to the capital and asking for it.\r\n\r\nEphraim was very much excited on finding himself in Washington, the sight\r\nof the place reviving in his mind a score of forgotten incidents of the\r\nwar. After supper they found seats in a corner of the corridor, where a\r\nnumber of people were scattered about, smoking and talking. It did not\r\noccur to Jethro or Cynthia, or even to Ephraim, that these people were\r\nall of the male sex, and on the other hand the guests of the hotel were\r\napparently used once in a while to see a lady from the country seated\r\nthere. At any rate, Cynthia was but a young girl, and her two companions,\r\nhowever unusual their appearance, were clearly most respectable. Jethro,\r\nhis hands in his pockets and his hat tilted, sat on the small of his back\r\nrapt in meditation; Cynthia, her head awhirl, looked around her with\r\nsparkling eyes; while Ephraim was smoking a cigar he had saved for just\r\nsuch a festal occasion. He did not see the stout man with the button and\r\ncorded hat until he was almost on top of him.\r\n\r\n\"Eph Prescott, I believe!\" exclaimed the stout one. \"How be you,\r\nComrade?\"\r\n\r\nHeedless of his rheumatism, Ephraim sprang to his feet and dropped the\r\ncigar, which the stout one picked up with much difficulty.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Ephraim, in a voice that shook with unwonted emotion, \"you\r\nkin skin me if it ain't Amasy Beard!\" His eye travelled around Amasa's\r\nfigure. \"Wouldn't a-knowed you, I swan, I wouldn't. Why, when I seen you\r\nlast, Amasy, your stomach was havin' all it could do to git hold of your\r\nbackbone.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia laughed outright, and even Jethro sat up and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"When was it?\" said Amasa, still clinging on to Ephraim's hand and\r\nincidentally to the cigar, which Ephraim had forgotten; \"Beaver Creek,\r\nwahn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"July 10, 1863,\" said Ephraim, instantly.\r\n\r\nGradually they reached a sitting position, the cigar was restored to its\r\nrightful owner, and Mr. Beard was introduced, with some ceremony, to\r\nCynthia and Jethro. From Beaver Creek they began to fight the war over\r\nagain, backward and forward, much to Cynthia's edification, when her\r\nattention was distracted by the entrance of a street band of wind\r\ninstruments. As the musicians made their way to another corner and began\r\ntuning up, she glanced mischievously at Jethro, for she knew his\r\npeculiarities by heart. One of these was a most violent detestation of\r\nany but the best music. He had often given her this excuse, laughingly,\r\nfor not going to meeting in Coniston. How he had come by his love for\r\ngood music, Cynthia never knew--he certainly had not heard much of it.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a great volume of sound filled the corridor, and the band burst\r\nforth into what many supposed to be \"The Watch on the Rhine.\" Some people\r\nwere plainly delighted; the veterans, once recovered from their surprise,\r\nshouted their reminiscences above the music, undismayed; Jethro held on\r\nto himself until the refrain, when he began to squirm, and as soon as the\r\ntune was done and the scattering applause had died down, he reached over\r\nand grabbed Mr. Amasa Beard by the knee. Mr. Beard did not immediately\r\nrespond, being at that moment behind logworks facing a rebel charge; he\r\nfelt vaguely that some one was trying to distract his attention, and in\r\nsome lobe of his brain was registered the fact that that particular knee\r\nhad gout in it. Jethro increased the pressure, and then Mr. Beard\r\nabandoned his logworks and swung around with a snort of pain.\r\n\r\n\"H-how much do they git for that noise--h-how much do they git?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Beard tenderly lifted the hand from his knee and stared at Jethro\r\nwith his mouth open, like a man aroused from a bad dream.\r\n\r\n\"Who? What noise?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"The Dutchmen,\" said Jethro. \"H-how much do they git for that noise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" Mr. Beard glanced at the band and began to laugh. He thought Jethro\r\na queer customer, no doubt, but he was a friend of Comrade Prescott's.\r\n\"By gum!\" said Mr. Beard, \"I thought for a minute a rebel chain-shot had\r\ntook my leg off. Well, sir, I guess that band gets about two dollars.\r\nThey've come in here every evening since I've been at the hotel.\"\r\n\r\n\"T-two dollars? Is that the price? Er--you say two dollars is their\r\nprice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thereabouts,\" answered Mr. Beard, uneasily. Veteran as he was, Jethro's\r\nappearance and earnestness were a little alarming.\r\n\r\n\"You say two dollars is their price?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thereabouts,\" shouted Mr. Beard, seating himself on the edge of his\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nBut Jethro paid no attention to him. He rose, unfolding by degrees his\r\nsix feet two, and strode diagonally across the corridor toward the band\r\nleader. Conversation was hushed at the sight of his figure, a titter ran\r\naround the walls, but Jethro was oblivious to these things. He drew a\r\ngreat calfskin wallet from an inside pocket of his coat, and the band\r\nleader, a florid German, laid down his instrument and made an elaborate\r\nbow. Jethro waited until the man had become upright and then held out a\r\ntwo-dollar bill.\r\n\r\n\"Is that about right for the performance?\" he said \"is that about right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ja, mein Herr,\" said the man, nodding vociferously.\r\n\r\n\"I want to pay what's right--I want to pay what's right,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you very much, sir,\" said the leader, finding his English, \"you\r\nhaf pay for all.\"\r\n\r\n\"P-paid for everything--everything to-night?\" demanded Jethro.\r\n\r\nThe leader spread out his hands.\r\n\r\n\"You haf pay for one whole evening,\" said he, and bowed again.\r\n\r\n\"Then take it, take it,\" said Jethro, pushing the bill into the man's\r\npalm; \"but don't you come back to-night--don't you come back to-night.\"\r\n\r\nThe amazed leader stared at Jethro--and words failed him. There was\r\nsomething about this man that compelled him to obey, and he gathered up\r\nhis followers and led the way silently out of the hotel. Roars of\r\nlaughter and applause arose on all sides; but Jethro was as one who heard\r\nthem not as he made his way back to his seat again.\r\n\r\n\"You did a good job, my friend,\" said Mr. Beard, approvingly. \"I'm going\r\nto take Eph Prescott down the street to see some of the boys. Won't you\r\ncome, too?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Beard doubtless accepted it as one of the man's eccentricities that\r\nJethro did not respond to him, for without more ado he departed arm in\r\narm with Ephraim. Jethro was looking at Cynthia, who was staring toward\r\nthe desk at the other end of the corridor, her face flushed, and her\r\nfingers closed over the arms of her chair. It never occurred to Jethro\r\nthat she might have been embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\"W-what's the matter, Cynthy?\" he asked, sinking into the chair beside\r\nher.\r\n\r\nHer breath caught sharply, but she tried to smile at him. He did not\r\ndiscover what was the matter until long afterward, when he recalled that\r\nevening to mind. Jethro was a man used to hotel corridors, used to\r\nsitting in an attitude that led the unsuspecting to believe he was half\r\nasleep; but no person of note could come or go whom he did not remember.\r\nHe had seen the distinguished party arrive at the desk, preceded by a\r\nhost of bell-boys with shawls and luggage. On the other hand, some of the\r\ndistinguished party had watched the proceeding of paying off the band\r\nwith no little amusement. Miss Janet Duncan had giggled audibly, her\r\nmother had smiled, while her father and Mr. Worthington had pretended to\r\nbe deeply occupied with the hotel register. Somers was not there. Bob\r\nWorthington laughed heartily with the rest until his eye, travelling down\r\nthe line of Jethro's progress, fell on Cynthia, and now he was striding\r\nacross the floor toward them. And even in the horrible confusion of that\r\nmoment Cynthia had a vagrant thought that his clothes had an enviable cut\r\nand became him remarkably.\r\n\r\n\"Well, of all things, to find you here!\" he cried; \"this is the best luck\r\nthat ever happened. I am glad to see you. I was going to steal away to\r\nBrampton for a couple of days before the term opened, and I meant to look\r\nyou up there. And Mr. Bass,\" said Bob, turning to Jethro, \"I'm glad to\r\nsee you too.\"\r\n\r\nJethro looked at the young man and smiled and held out his hand. It was\r\nevident that Bob was blissfully unaware that hostilities between powers\r\nof no mean magnitude were about to begin; that the generals themselves\r\nwere on the ground, and that he was holding treasonable parley with the\r\nenemy. The situation appealed to Jethro, especially as he glanced at the\r\nbacks of the two gentlemen facing the desk. These backs seemed to him\r\nfull of expression. \"Th-thank you, Bob, th-thank you,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"I like the way you fixed that band,\" said Bob; \"I haven't laughed as\r\nmuch for a year. You hate music, don't you? I hope you'll forgive that\r\nawful noise we made outside of your house last July, Mr. Bass.\"\r\n\r\n\"You--you make that noise, Bob, you--you make that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Bob, \"I'm afraid I did most of it. There was another fellow\r\nthat helped some and played the guitar. It was pretty bad,\" he added,\r\nwith a side glance at Cynthia, \"but it was meant for a compliment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said she, \"it was meant for a compliment, was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" he answered, glad of the opportunity to turn his attention\r\nentirely to her. \"I was for slipping away right after supper, but my\r\nfather headed us off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Slipping away?\" repeated Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"You see, he had a kind of a reception and fireworks afterward. We didn't\r\nget away till after nine, and then I thought I'd have a lecture when I\r\ngot home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you?\" asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Bob, \"he didn't know where I'd been.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia felt the blood rush to her temples, but by habit and instinct she\r\nknew when to restrain herself.\r\n\r\n\"Would it have made any difference to him where you had been?\" she asked\r\ncalmly enough.\r\n\r\nBob had a presentiment that he was on dangerous ground. This new and\r\nself-possessed Cynthia was an enigma to him--certainly a fascinating\r\nenigma.\r\n\r\n\"My father world have thought I was a fool to go off serenading,\" he\r\nanswered, flushing. Bob did not like a lie; he knew that his father would\r\nhave been angry if he had heard he had gone to Coniston; he felt, in the\r\nsmall of his back, that his father was angry mow, and guessed the reason.\r\n\r\nShe regarded him gravely as he spoke, and then her eyes left his face and\r\nbecame fixed upon an object at the far end of the corridor. Bob turned in\r\ntime to see Janet Duncan swing on her heel and follow her mother up the\r\nstairs. He struggled to find words to tide over what he felt was an\r\nawkward moment.\r\n\r\n\"We've had a fine trip;\" he said, \"though I should much rather have\r\nstayed at home. The West is a wonderful country, with its canons and\r\nmountains and great stretches of plain. My father met us in Chicago, and\r\nwe came here. I don't know why, because Washington's dead at this time of\r\nthe year. I suppose it must be on account of politics.\" Looking at Jethro\r\nwith a sudden inspiration, \"I hadn't thought of that.\"\r\n\r\nJethro had betrayed no interest in the conversation. He was seated, as\r\nusual, on the small of his back. But he saw a young man of short stature,\r\nwith a freckled face and close-cropped, curly red hair, come into the\r\ncorridor by another entrance; he saw Isaac D. Worthington draw him aside\r\nand speak to him, and he saw the young man coming towards them.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Miss Wetherell?\" cried the young man joyously, while\r\nstill ten feet away, \"I'm awfully glad to see you, upon my word; I am.\r\nHow long are you going to be in Washington?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, Mr. Duncan,\" answered Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Did Worthy know you were here?\" demanded Mr. Duncan, suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"He did when he saw me,\" said Cynthia, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Not till then?\" asked Mr. Duncan. \"Say, Worthy; your father wants to see\r\nyou right away. I'm going to be in Washington a day or two--will you go\r\nwalking with me to-morrow morning, Miss Wetherell?\"\r\n\r\n\"She's going walking with me,\" said Bob, not in the best of tempers.\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll go along,\" said Mr. Duncan, promptly.\r\n\r\nBy this time Cynthia got up and was holding out her hand to Bob\r\nWorthington. \"I'm not going walking with either of you,\" she said \"I have\r\nanother engagement. And I think I'll have to say good night, because I'm\r\nvery tired.\"\r\n\r\n\"When can I see you?\" Both the young men asked the question at once.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you'll have plenty of chances,\" she answered, and was gone.\r\n\r\nThe young men looked at each other somewhat blankly; and then down at\r\nJethro, who did not seem to know that they were there, and then they made\r\ntheir way toward the desk. But Isaac D. Worthington and his friends had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the distinguished-looking senator with whom Jethro\r\nhad been in conversation before supper entered the hotel. He seemed\r\npreoccupied, and heedless of the salutations he received; but when he\r\ncaught sight of Jethro he crossed the corridor rapidly and sat down\r\nbeside him. Jethro did not move. The corridor was deserted now, save for\r\nthe two.\r\n\r\n\"Bass,\" began the senator, \"what's the row up in your state?\"\r\n\r\n\"H-haven't heard of any row,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"What did you come to Washington for?\" demanded the senator, somewhat\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\n\"Er--vacation,\" said Jethro, \"vacation--to show my gal, Cynthy, the\r\ncapital.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now see here, Bass,\" said the senator, \"I don't forget what happened in\r\n'70. I don't object to wading through a swarm of bees to get a little\r\nhoney for a friend, but I think I'm entitled to know why he wants it.\"\r\n\r\n\"G-got the honey?\" asked Jethro.\r\n\r\nThe senator took off his hat and wiped his brow, and then he stole a look\r\nat Jethro, with apparently barren results.\r\n\r\n\"Jethro,\" he said, \"people say you run that state of yours right up to\r\nthe handle. What's all this trouble about a two-for-a-cent\r\npostmastership?\"\r\n\r\n\"H-haven't heard of any trouble,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there is trouble,\" said the senator, losing patience at last. \"When\r\nI told Grant you were here and mentioned that little Brampton matter to\r\nhim,--it didn't seem much to me,--the bees began to fly pretty thick, I\r\ncan tell you. I saw right away that somebody had been stirring 'em up. It\r\nlooks to me, Jethro,\" said the senator gravely, \"it looks to me as if you\r\nhad something of a rebellion on your hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"W-what'd Grant say?\" Jethro inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he didn't say a great deal--he isn't much of a talker, you know,\r\nbut what he did say was to the point. It seems that your man, Prescott,\r\ndoesn't come from Brampton, in the first place, and Grant says that while\r\nhe likes soldiers, he hasn't any use for the kind that want to lie down\r\nand make the government support 'em. I'll tell you what I found out.\r\nWorthington and Duncan wired the President this morning, and they've gone\r\nup to the White House now. They've got a lot of railroad interests back\r\nof them, and they've taken your friend Sutton into camp; but I managed to\r\nget the President to promise not to do anything until he saw you tomorrow\r\nafternoon at two.\"\r\n\r\nJethro sat silent so long that the senator began to think he wasn't going\r\nto answer him at all. In his opinion, he had told Jethro some very grave\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\n\"W-when are you going to see the President again?\" said Jethro, at last.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow morning,\" answered the senator; \"he wants me to walk over with\r\nhim to see the postmaster-general, who is sick in bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"What time do you leave the White House?--\"\r\n\r\n\"At eleven,\" said the senator, very much puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"Er--Grant ever pay any attention to an old soldier on the street?\"\r\n\r\nThe senator glanced at Jethro, and a twinkle came into his eye.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes he has been known to,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"You--you ever pay any attention to an old soldier on the street?\"\r\n\r\nThen the senator's eyes began to snap.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes I have been known to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--suppose an old soldier was in front of the White House at eleven\r\no'clock--an old soldier with a gal suppose?\"\r\n\r\nThe senator saw the point, and took no pains to restrain his admiration.\r\n\r\n\"Jethro,\" he said, slapping him on the shoulder, \"I'm willing to bet a\r\nfew thousand dollars you'll run your state for a while yet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\"Heard you say you was goin' for a walk this morning, Cynthy,\" Jethro\r\nremarked, as they sat at breakfast the next morning.\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course,\" answered Cynthia, \"Cousin Eph and I are going out to\r\nsee Washington, and he is to show me the places that he remembers.\" She\r\nlooked at Jethro appealingly. \"Aren't you coming with us?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"M-meet you at eleven, Cynthy,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Eleven!\" exclaimed Cynthia in dismay, \"that's almost dinner-time.\"\r\n\r\n\"M-meet you in front of the White House at eleven,\" said Jethro, \"plumb\r\nin front of it, under a tree.\"\r\n\r\nBy half-past seven, Cynthia and Ephraim with his green umbrella were in\r\nthe street, but it would be useless to burden these pages with a\r\ndescription of all the sights they saw, and with the things that Ephraim\r\nsaid about them, and incidentally about the war. After New York, much of\r\nWashington would then have seemed small and ragged to any one who lacked\r\nideals and a national sense, but Washington was to Cynthia as Athens to a\r\nGreek. To her the marble Capitol shining on its hill was a sacred temple,\r\nand the great shaft that struck upward through the sunlight, though yet\r\nunfinished, a fitting memorial to him who had led the barefoot soldiers\r\nof the colonies through ridicule to victory. They looked up many\r\ninstitutions and monument, they even had time to go to the Navy Yard, and\r\nthey saved the contemplation of the White House till the last. The White\r\nHouse, which Cynthia thought the finest and most graceful mansion in all\r\nthe world, in its simplicity and dignity, a fitting dwelling for the\r\nchosen of the nation. Under the little tree which Jethro had mentioned,\r\nEphraim stood bareheaded before the walls which had sheltered Lincoln,\r\nwhich were now the home of the greatest of his captains, Grant: and\r\nwondrous emotions played upon the girl's spirit, too, as she gazed. They\r\nforgot the present in the past and the future, and they did not see the\r\ntwo gentlemen who had left the portico some minutes before and were now\r\ncoming toward them along the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen, however, slowed their steps involuntarily at a sight\r\nwhich was uncommon, even in Washington. The girl's arm was in the\r\nsoldier's, and her face, which even in repose had a true nobility, now\r\nwas alight with an inspiration that is seen but seldom in a lifetime. In\r\nmarble, could it have been wrought by a great sculptor, men would have\r\ndreamed before it of high things.\r\n\r\nThe two, indeed, might have stood for a group, the girl as the spirit,\r\nthe man as the body which had risked and suffered all for it, and still\r\nheld it fast. For the honest face of the soldier reflected that spirit as\r\ntruly as a mirror.\r\n\r\nEphraim was aroused from his thoughts by Cynthia nudging his arm. He\r\nstarted, put on his hat, and stared very hard at a man smoking a cigar\r\nwho was standing before him. Then he stiffened and raised his hand in an\r\ninvoluntary salute. The man smiled. He was not very tall, he had a\r\nclosely trimmed light beard that was growing a little gray, he wore a\r\nsoft hat something like Ephraim's, a black tie on a white pleated shirt,\r\nand his eyeglasses were pinned to his vest. His eyes were all kindness.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Comrade?\" he said, holding out his hand.\r\n\r\n\"General,\" said Ephraim, \"Mr. President,\" he added, correcting himself,\r\n\"how be you?\" He shifted the green umbrella, and shook the hand timidly\r\nbut warmly.\r\n\r\n\"General will do,\" said the President, with a smiling glance at the tall\r\nsenator beside him, \"I like to be called General.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've growed some older, General,\" said Ephraim, scanning his face with\r\na simple reverence and affection, \"but you hain't changed so much as I'd\r\na thought since I saw you whittlin' under a tree beside the Lacy house in\r\nthe Wilderness.\"\r\n\r\n\"My duty has changed some,\" answered the President, quite as simply. He\r\nadded with a touch of sadness, \"I liked those days best, Comrade.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess!\" exclaimed Ephraim, \"you're general over everything now,\r\nbut you're not a mite bigger man to me than you was.\"\r\n\r\nThe President took the compliment as it was meant.\r\n\r\n\"I found it easier to run an army than I do to run a country,\" he said.\r\n\r\nEphraim's blue eyes flamed with indignation.\r\n\r\n\"I don't take no stock in the bull-dogs and the gold harness at Long\r\nBranch and--and all them lies the dratted newspapers print about\r\nyou,\"--Ephraim hammered his umbrella on the pavement as an expression of\r\nhis feelings,--\"and what's more, the people don't.\"\r\n\r\nThe President glanced at the senator again, and laughed a little,\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you; Comrade,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You're a plain, common man,\" continued Ephraim, paying the highest\r\ncompliment known to rural New England; \"the people think a sight of you,\r\nor they wouldn't hev chose you twice, General.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you were in the Wilderness?\" said the President, adroitly changing\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, General. I was pressed into orderly duty the first day--that's when\r\nI saw you whittlin' under the tree, and you didn't seem to have no more\r\nconsarn than if it had been a company drill. Had a cigar then, too. But\r\nthe second day; May the 6th, I was with the regiment. I'll never forget\r\nthat day,\" said Ephraim, warming to the subject, \"when we was fightin'\r\nEwell up and down the Orange Plank Road, playin' hide-and-seek with the\r\nJohnnies in the woods. You remember them woods, General?\"\r\n\r\nThe President nodded, his cigar between his teeth. He looked as though\r\nthe scene were coming back to him.\r\n\r\n\"Never seen such woods,\" said Ephraim, \"scrub oak and pine and cedars and\r\nyoung stuff springin' up until you couldn't see the length of a company,\r\nand the Rebs jumpin' and hollerin' around and shoutin' every which way.\r\nAfter a while a lot of them saplings was mowed off clean by the bullets,\r\nand then the woods caught afire, and that was hell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you wounded?\" asked the President, quickly.\r\n\r\n\"I was hurt some, in the hip,\" answered Ephraim.\r\n\r\n\"Some!\" exclaimed Cynthia, \"why, you have walked lame ever since.\" She\r\nknew the story by heart, but the recital of it never failed to stir her\r\nblood! They carried him out just as he was going to be burned up, in a\r\nblanket hung from rifles, and he was in the hospital nine months, and had\r\nto come home for a while.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cynthy,\" said Ephraim in gentle reproof, \"I callate the General don't\r\nwant to hear that.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia flushed, but the President looked at her with an added interest.\r\n\r\n\"My dear young lady,\" he said, \"that seems to me the vital part of the\r\nstory. If I remember rightly,\" he added, turning again to Ephraim, the\r\nFifth Corps was on the Orange turnpike. What brigade were you in?\"\r\n\r\n\"The third brigade of the First Division,\" answered Ephraim.\r\n\r\n\"Griffin's,\" said the President. \"There were several splendid New England\r\nregiments in that brigade. I sent them with Griffin to help Sheridan at\r\nFive Forks.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thar too,\" cried Ephraim.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said the President, \"with the lame hip?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, General, I went back, I couldn't help it. I couldn't stay away\r\nfrom the boys--just couldn't. I didn't limp as bad then as I do now. I\r\nwahn't much use anywhere else, and I had l'arned to fight. Five Forks!\"\r\nexclaimed Ephraim. \"I call that day to mind as if it was yesterday. I\r\nremember how the boys yelled when they told us we was goin' to Sheridan.\r\nWe got started about daylight, and it took us till four o'clock in the\r\nafternoon to git into position. The woods was just comin' a little green,\r\nand the white dogwoods was bloomin' around. Sheridan, he galloped up to\r\nthe line with that black horse of his'n and hollered out, 'Come on, boys,\r\ngo in at a clean, jump or You won't ketch one of 'em.' You know how men,\r\neven veterans like that Fifth Corps, sometimes hev to be pushed into a\r\nfight. There was a man from a Maine regiment got shot in the head fust\r\nthing. 'I'm killed,' said he. 'Oh, no, you're not,' says Sheridan,\r\n'pickup your gun and go for 'em.' But he was killed. Well, we went for\r\n'em through all the swamps and briers and everything, and Sheridan, thar\r\nin front, had got the battle-flag and was rushin' round with it swearin'\r\nand prayin' and shoutin', and the first thing we knowed he'd jumped his\r\nhorse clean over their logworks and landed right on top of the\r\nJohnnie's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the President, \"that was Sheridan, sure enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President,\" said the senator, who stood by wonderingly while General\r\nGrant had lost himself in this conversation, \"do you realize what time it\r\nis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the President, \"we must go on. What was your rank,\r\nComrade?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sergeant, General.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you have got a good pension for that hip,\" said the President,\r\nkindly. It may be well to add that he was not always so incautious, but\r\nthis soldier bore the unmistakable stamp of simplicity and sincerity on\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\nEphraim hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"He never would ask for a pension, General,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed the President in real astonishment, \"are you so rich as\r\nall that?\" and he glanced at the green umbrella.\r\n\r\n\"Well, General,\" said Ephraim, uncomfortably, \"I never liked the notion\r\nof gittin' paid for it. You see, I was what they call a war-Democrat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" said the President, but more to himself. \"What do you do\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I callate to make harness,\" answered Ephraim.\r\n\r\n\"Only he can't make it any more on account of his rheumatism, Mr.\r\nPresident,\" Cynthia put in.\r\n\r\n\"I think you might call me General, too,\" he said, with the grace that\r\nmany simple people found inherent in him. \"And may I ask your name, young\r\nlady?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia Wetherell--General,\" she said smiling.\r\n\r\n\"That sounds more natural,\" said the President, and then to Ephraim,\r\n\"Your daughter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't think more of her if she was,\" answered Ephraim; \"Cynthy's\r\npulled me through some tight spells. Her mother was my cousin, General.\r\nMy name's Prescott--Ephraim Prescott.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ephraim Prescott!\" ejaculated the President, sharply, taking his cigar\r\nfrom his mouth, \"Ephraim Prescott!\"\r\n\r\n\"Prescott--that's right--Prescott, General,\" repeated Ephraim, sorely\r\npuzzled by these manifestations of amazement.\r\n\r\n\"What did you come to Washington for?\" asked the President.\r\n\r\n\"Well, General, I kind of hate to tell you--I didn't intend to mention\r\nthat. I guess I won't say nothin' about it,\" he added, \"we've had such a\r\nsociable time. I've always b'en a little mite ashamed of it, General,\r\never since 'twas first mentioned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" said the President again, and then he looked at Cynthia.\r\n\"What is it, Miss Cynthia?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nIt was now Cynthia's turn to be a little confused.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro--that is, Mr. Bass\" (the President nodded), \"went to Cousin\r\nEph when he couldn't make harness any more and said he'd give him the\r\nBrampton post-office.\"\r\n\r\nThe President's eyes met the senator's, and both gentlemen laughed.\r\nCynthia bit her lip, not seeing any cause for mirth in her remark, while\r\nEphraim looked uncomfortable and mopped the perspiration from his brow.\r\n\r\n\"He said he'd give it to him, did he?\" said the President. \"Is Mr. Bass\r\nyour uncle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, General,\" replied Cynthia, \"he's really no relation. He's done\r\neverything for me, and I live with him since my father died. He was going\r\nto meet us here,\" she continued, looking around hurriedly, \"I'm sure I\r\ncan't think what's kept him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, we are half an hour late already,\" said the senator,\r\nhurriedly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" said the President, \"I suppose I must go. Good-by, Miss\r\nCynthia,\" said he, taking the girl's hand warmly. \"Good-by, Comrade. If\r\never you want to see General Grant, just send in your name. Good-by.\"\r\n\r\nThe President lifted his hat politely to Cynthia and passed. He said\r\nsomething to the senator which they did not hear, and the senator laughed\r\nheartily. Ephraim and Cynthia watched them until they were out of sight.\r\n\r\n\"Godfrey!\" exclaimed Ephraim, \"they told me he was hard to talk to. Why,\r\nCynthy, he's as simple as a child.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've always thought that all great men must be simple,\" said Cynthia;\r\n\"Uncle Jethro is.\"\r\n\r\n\"To think that the President of the United States stood talkin' to us on\r\nthe sidewalk for half an hour,\" said Ephraim, clutching Cynthia's arm.\r\n\"Cynthy, I'm glad we didn't press that post-office matter it was worth\r\nmore to me than all the post-offices in the Union to have that talk with\r\nGeneral Grant.\"\r\n\r\nThey waited some time longer under the tree, happy in the afterglow of\r\nthis wonderful experience. Presently a clock struck twelve.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's dinner-time, Cynthy,\" said Ephraim. \"I guess Jethro haint'\r\na-comin'--must hev b'en delayed by some of them politicians.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the first time I ever knew him to miss an appointment,\" said\r\nCynthia, as they walked back to the hotel.\r\n\r\nJethro was not in the corridor, so they passed on to the dining room and\r\nlooked eagerly from group to group. Jethro was not there, either, but\r\nCynthia heard some one laughing above the chatter of the guests, and drew\r\nback into the corridor. She had spied the Duncans and the Worthingtons\r\nmaking merry by themselves at a corner table, and it was Somers's laugh\r\nthat she heard. Bob, too, sitting next to Miss Duncan, was much amused\r\nabout something. Suddenly Cynthia's exaltation over the incident of the\r\nmorning seemed to leave her, and Bob Worthington's words which she had\r\npondered over in the night came back to her with renewed force. He did\r\nnot find it necessary to steal away to see Miss Duncan. Why should he\r\nhave \"stolen away\" to see her? Was it because she was a country girl, and\r\npoor? That was true; but on the other hand, did she not live in the\r\nsunlight, as it were, of Uncle Jethro's greatness, and was it not an\r\nhonor to come to his house and see any one? And why had Mr. Worthington\r\nturned hid back on Jethro, and sent for Bob when he was talking to them?\r\nCynthia could not understand these things, and her pride was sorely\r\nwounded by them.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps Jethro's in his room,\" suggested Ephraim.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed they found him there seated on the bed, poring over some\r\nnewspapers, and both in a breath demanded where he had been. Ephraim did\r\nnot wait for an answer.\r\n\r\n\"We seen General Grant, Jethro,\" he cried; \"while we was waitin' for you\r\nunder the tree he come up and stood talkin' to us half an hour. Full half\r\nan hour, wahn't it, Cynthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" answered Cynthia, forgetting her own grievance at the\r\nrecollection; \"only it didn't seem nearly that long.\"\r\n\r\n\"W-want to know!\" exclaimed Jethro, in astonishment, putting down his\r\npaper. \"H-how did it happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come right up and spoke to us,\" said Ephraim, in a tone he might have\r\nused to describe a miracle, \"jest as if he was common folk. Never had a\r\nmore sociable talk with anybody. Why, there was times when I clean forgot\r\nhe was President of the United States. The boys won't believe it when we\r\ngit back at Coniston.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Ephraim, full of his subject, began to recount from the beginning the\r\nmarvellous affair, occasionally appealing to Cynthia for confirmation.\r\nHow he had lived over again the Wilderness and Five Forks; how the\r\nGeneral had changed since he had seen him whittling under a tree; how the\r\nGeneral had asked about his pension.\r\n\r\n\"D-didn't mention the post-office, did you, Ephraim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, no,\" replied Ephraim, \"I didn't like to exactly. You see, we was\r\nhavin' such a good time I didn't want to spoil it, but Cynthy--\"\r\n\r\n\"I told the President about it, Uncle Jethro; I told him how sick Cousin\r\nEph had been, and that you were going to give him the postmastership\r\nbecause he couldn't work any more with his hands.\"\r\n\r\nThe training of a lifetime had schooled Jethro not to betray surprise.\r\n\r\n\"K-kind of mixin' up in politics, hain't you, Cynthy? P-President say\r\nhe'd give you the postmastership, Eph?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"He didn't say nothin' about it, Jethro,\" answered Ephraim slowly; \"I\r\ncallate he has other views for the place, and he was too kind to come\r\nright out with 'em and spoil our mornin'. You see, Jethro, I wahn't only\r\na sergeant, and Brampton's gittin' to be a big town.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, surely,\" cried Cynthia, who could scarcely wait for him to finish,\r\n\"surely you're going to give Cousin Eph the post-office, aren't you,\r\nUncle Jethro? All you have to do is to tell the President that you want\r\nit for him. Why, I had an idea that we came down for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Cynthy,\" Ephraim put in, deprecatingly.\r\n\r\n\"Who else would get the post-office?\" asked Cynthia. \"Surely you're not\r\ngoing to let Mr. Sutton have it for Dave Wheelock!\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--Cynthy,\" said Jethro, slyly, \"w-what'd you say to me once about\r\ninterferin' with women's fixin's?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia saw the point. She perceived also that the mazes of politics were\r\nnot to be understood by a young woman, of even by an old soldier. She\r\nlaughed and seized Jethro's hands and pulled him from the bed.\r\n\r\n\"We won't get any dinner unless we hurry,\" she said.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the dining room she was relieved to discover that the\r\nparty in the corner had gone.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon there were many more sights to be viewed, but they were\r\nback in the hotel again by half-past four, because Ephraim's Wilderness\r\nleg had its limits of endurance. Jethro (though he had not mentioned the\r\nfact to them) had gone to the White House.\r\n\r\nIt was during the slack hours that our friend the senator, whose interest\r\nin the matter of the Brampton post office out-weighed for the present\r\ncertain grave problems of the Administration in which he was involved,\r\nhurried into the Willard Hotel, looking for Jethro Bass. He found him\r\nwithout much trouble in his usual attitude, occupying one of the chairs\r\nin the corridor.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" exclaimed the senator, with a touch of eagerness he did not often\r\nbetray, \"did you see Grant? How about your old soldier? He's one of the\r\nmost delightful characters I ever met--simple as a child,\" and he laughed\r\nat the recollection. \"That was a masterstroke of yours, Bass, putting him\r\nunder that tree with that pretty girl. I doubt if you ever did anything\r\nbetter in your life. Did they tell you about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jethro, \"they told me about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how about Grant? What did he say to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"W-well, I went up there and sent in my card. D-didn't have to wait a\r\ngreat while, as I was pretty early, and soon he came in, smokin' a black\r\ncigar, head bent forward a little. D-didn't ask me to sit down, and what\r\ntalkin' we did we did standin'. D-didn't ask me what he could do for me,\r\nwhat I wanted, or anything else, but just stood there, and I stood there.\r\nF-fust time in my life I didn't know how to commerce or what to say;\r\nlooked--looked at me--didn't take his eye off me. After a while I got\r\nstarted, somehow; told him I was there to ask him to appoint Ephraim\r\nPrescott to the Brampton postoffice--t-told him all about Ephraim from\r\nthe time he was locked in the cradle--never was so hard put that I could\r\nremember. T-told him how Ephraim shook butternuts off my fathers\r\ntree--for all I know. T-told him all about Ephraim's war\r\nrecord--leastways all I could call to mind--and, by Godfrey! before I got\r\nthrough, I wished I'd listened to more of it. T-told him about Ephraim's\r\nWilderness bullets--t-told him about Ephraim's rheumatism,--how it\r\nbothered him when he went to bed and when he got up again.\"\r\n\r\nIf Jethro had glanced at his companion, he would have seen the senator\r\nwas shaking with silent and convulsive laughter.\r\n\r\n\"All the time I talked to him I didn't see a muscle move in his face,\"\r\nJethro continued, \"so I started in again, and he looked--looked--looked\r\nright at me. W-wouldn't wink--don't think he winked once while I was in\r\nthat room. I watched him as close as I could, and I watched to see if a\r\nmuscle moved or if I was makin' any impression. All he would do was to\r\nstand there and look--look--look. K-kept me there ten minutes and never\r\nopened his mouth at all. Hardest man to talk to I ever met--never see a\r\nman before but what I could get him to say somethin', if it was only a\r\ncuss word. I got tired of it after a while, made up my mind that I had\r\nfound one man I couldn't move. Then what bothered me was to get out of\r\nthat room. If I'd a had a Bible I believe I'd a read it to him. I didn't\r\nknow what to say, but I did say this after a while:--\"'W-well, Mr.\r\nPresident, I guess I've kept you long enough--g-guess you're a pretty\r\nbusy man. H-hope you'll give Mr. Prescott that postmastership. Er--er\r\ngood-by.'\r\n\r\n\"'Wait, sir,' he said.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' I said, 'I-I'll wait.'\r\n\r\n\"Thought you was goin' to give him that postmastership, Mr. Bass,' he\r\nsaid.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point the senator could not control his mirth, and the empty\r\ncorridor echoed his laughter.\r\n\r\n\"By thunder! what did you say to that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--I said, 'Mr. President, I thought I was until a while ago.'\r\n\r\n\"'And when did you change your mind?' says he.\"\r\n\r\nThen he laughed a little--not much--but he laughed a little.\r\n\r\n\"'I understand that your old soldier lives within the limits of the\r\ndelivery of the Brampton office,' said he.\"\r\n\r\n\"'That's correct, Mr. President,' said I.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' said he, 'I will app'int him postmaster at Brampton, Mr. Bass.'\"\r\n\r\n\"'When?' said I.\"\r\n\r\nThen he laughed a little more.\r\n\r\n\"I'll have the app'intment sent to your hotel this afternoon,' said he.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Then I said to him, 'This has come out full better than I expected, Mr.\r\nPresident. I'm much obliged to you.' He didn't say nothin' more, so I\r\ncome out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Grant didn't say anything about Worthington or Duncan, did he?\" asked\r\nthe senator, curiously, as he rose to go.\r\n\r\n\"G-guess I've told you all he said,\" answered Jethro; \"'twahn't a great\r\ndeal.\"\r\n\r\nThe senator held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Bass,\" he said, laughing, \"I believe you came pretty near meeting your\r\nmatch. But if Grant's the hardest man in the Union to get anything out\r\nof, I've a notion who's the second.\" And with this parting shot the\r\nsenator took his departure, chuckling to himself as he went.\r\n\r\nAs has been said, there were but few visitors in Washington at this time,\r\nand the hotel corridor was all but empty. Presently a substantial-looking\r\ngentleman came briskly in from the street, nodding affably to the colored\r\nporters and bell-boys, who greeted him by name. He wore a flowing Prince\r\nAlbert coat, which served to dignify a growing portliness, and his\r\ncoal-black whiskers glistened in the light. A voice, which appeared to\r\ncome from nowhere in particular, brought the gentleman up standing.\r\n\r\n\"How be you, Heth?\"\r\n\r\nIt may not be that Mr. Sutton's hand trembled, but the ashes of his cigar\r\nfell to the floor. He was not used to visitations, and for the instant,\r\nif the truth be told, he was not equal to looking around.\r\n\r\n\"Like Washington, Heth--like Washington?\"\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Sutton turned. His presence of mind, and that other presence of\r\nwhich he was so proud, seemed for the moment to have deserted him.\r\n\r\n\"S-stick pretty close to business, Heth, comin' down here out of session\r\ntime. S-stick pretty close to business, don't you, since the people sent\r\nyou to Congress?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sutton might have offered another man a cigar or a drink, but (as is\r\nwell known) Jethro was proof against tobacco or stimulants.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the Honorable Heth, catching his breath and making a dive,\r\n\"I am surprised to see you, Jethro,\" which was probably true.\r\n\r\n\"Th-thought you might be,\" said Jethro. \"Er--glad to see me, Heth--glad\r\nto see me?\"\r\n\r\nAs has been recorded, it is peculiarly difficult to lie to people who are\r\nnot to be deceived.\r\n\r\n\"Why, certainly I am,\" answered the Honorable Heth, swallowing hard,\r\n\"certainly I am, Jethro. I meant to have got to Coniston this summer, but\r\nI was so busy--\"\r\n\r\n\"Peoples' business, I understand. Er--hear you've gone in for high-minded\r\npolitics, Heth--r-read a highminded speech of yours--two high-minded\r\nspeeches. Always thought you was a high-minded man, Heth.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you like those speeches, Jethro?\" asked Mr. Sutton, striving as\r\nbest he might to make some show of dignity.\r\n\r\n\"Th-thought they was high-minded,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\nThen there was a silence, for Mr. Sutton could think of nothing more to\r\nsay. And he yearned to depart with a great yearning, but something held\r\nhim there.\r\n\r\n\"Heth,\" said Jethro after a while, \"you was always very friendly and\r\nobliging. You've done a great many favors for me in your life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've always tried to be neighborly, Jethro,\" said Mr. Sutton, but his\r\nvoice sounded a little husky even to himself.\r\n\r\n\"And I may have done one or two little things for you, Heth,\" Jethro\r\ncontinued, \"but I can't remember exactly. Er--can you remember, Heth.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sutton was trying with becoming nonchalance to light the stump of his\r\ncigar. He did not succeed this time. He pulled himself together with a\r\nsupreme effort.\r\n\r\n\"I think we've both been mutually helpful, Jethro,\" he said, \"mutually\r\nhelpful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Jethro, reflectively, \"I don't know as I could have put it\r\nas well as that--there's somethin' in being an orator.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another silence, a much longer one. The Honorable Heth threw\r\nhis butt away, and lighted another cigar. Suddenly, as if by magic, his\r\naplomb returned, and in a flash of understanding he perceived the\r\nsituation. He saw himself once more as the successful congressman, the\r\ntrusted friend of the railroad interests, and he saw Jethro as a\r\ndiscredited boss. He did not stop to reflect that Jethro did not act like\r\na discredited boss, as a keener man might have done. But if the Honorable\r\nHeth had been a keener man, he would not have been at that time a\r\ncongressman. Mr. Sutton accused himself of having been stupid in not\r\ngrasping at once that the tables were turned, and that now he was the one\r\nto dispense the gifts.\r\n\r\n\"K-kind of fortunate you stopped to speak to me, Heth. N-now I come to\r\nthink of it, I hev a little favor to ask of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Mr. Sutton, blowing out the smoke; \"of course anything I\r\ncan do, Jethro--anything in reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"W-wouldn't ask a high-minded man to do anything he hadn't ought to,\"\r\nsaid Jethro; \"the fact is, I'd like to git Eph Prescott appointed at the\r\nBrampton post-office. You can fix that, Heth--can't you--you can fix\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sutton stuck his thumb into his vest pocket and cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n\"I can't tell you how sorry I am not to oblige you, Jethro, but I've\r\narranged to give that post-office to Dave Wheelock.\"\r\n\r\n\"A-arranged it, hev You--a-arranged it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes,\" said Mr. Sutton, scarcely believing his own ears. Could it be\r\npossible that he was using this patronizingly kind tone to Jethro Bass?\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's too bad,\" said Jethro; \"g-got it all fixed, hev you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Practically,\" answered Mr. Sutton, grandly; \"indeed, I may go as far as\r\nto say that it is as certain as if I had the appointment here in my\r\npocket. I'm sorry not to oblige you, Jethro; but these are matters which\r\na member of Congress must look after pretty closely.\" He held out his\r\nhand, but Jethro did not appear to see it,--he had his in his pockets.\r\n\"I've an important engagement,\" said the Honorable Heth, consulting a\r\nlarge gold watch. \"Are you going to be in Washington long?\"\r\n\r\n\"G-guess I've about got through, Heth--g-guess I've about got through,\"\r\nsaid Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you have time and there's any other little thing, I'm in Room\r\n29,\" said Mr. Sutton, as he put his foot on the stairway.\r\n\r\n\"T-told Worthington you got that app'intment for Wheelock--t-told\r\nWorthington?\" Jethro called out after him.\r\n\r\nMr. Sutton turned and waved his cigar and smiled in acknowledgment of\r\nthis parting bit of satire. He felt that he could afford to smile. A few\r\nminutes later he was ensconced on the sofa of a private sitting room\r\nreviewing the incident, with much gusto, for the benefit of Mr. Isaac D.\r\nWorthington and Mr. Alexander Duncan. Both of these gentlemen laughed\r\nheartily, for the Honorable Heth Sutton knew the art of telling a story\r\nwell, at least, and was often to be seen with a group around him in the\r\nlobbies of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nAbout five o'clock that afternoon Ephraim was sitting in his\r\nshirt-sleeves by the window of his room, and Cynthia was reading aloud to\r\nhim an article (about the war, of course) from a Washington paper, which\r\nhis friend, Mr. Beard, had sent him. There was a knock at the door, and\r\nCynthia opened it to discover a colored hall-boy with a roll in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Mistah Ephum Prescott?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Ephraim, \"that's me.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia shut the door and gave him the roll, but Ephraim took it as\r\nthough he were afraid of its contents.\r\n\r\n\"Guess it's some of them war records from Amasy,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Cousin Eph,\" exclaimed Cynthia, excitedly, \"why don't you open it?\r\nIf you don't I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess you'd better, Cynthy,\" and he held it out to her with a trembling\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nCynthia did open it, and drew out a large document with seals and\r\nprinting and signatures.\r\n\r\n\"Cousin Eph,\" she cried, holding it under his nose, \"Cousin Eph, you're\r\npostmaster of Brampton!\"\r\n\r\nEphraim looked at the paper, but his eyes swam, and he could only make\r\nout a dancing, bronze seal.\r\n\r\n\"I want to know!\" he exclaimed. \"Fetch Jethro.\"\r\n\r\nBut Cynthia had already flown on that errand. Curiously enough, she ran\r\ninto Jethro in the hall immediately outside of Ephraim's door. Ephraim\r\ngot to his feet; it was very difficult for him to realize that his\r\ntroubles were ended, that he was to earn his living at last. He looked at\r\nJethro, and his eyes filled with tears. \"I guess I can't thank you as I'd\r\nought to, Jethro,\" he said, \"leastways, not now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll thank him for you, Cousin Eph,\" said Cynthia. And she did.\r\n\r\n\"D-don't thank me,\" said Jethro, \"I didn't have much to do with it, Eph.\r\nThank the President.\"\r\n\r\nEphraim did thank the President, in one of the most remarkable letters,\r\nfrom a literary point of view, ever received at the White House. For the\r\nart of literature largely consists in belief in what one is writing, and\r\nEphraim's letter had this quality of sincerity, and no lack of vividness\r\nas well. He spent most of the evening in composing it.\r\n\r\nCynthia, too, had received a letter that day--a letter which she had read\r\nseveral times, now with a smile, and again with a pucker of the forehead\r\nwhich was meant for a frown. \"Dear Cynthia,\" it said. \"Where do you keep\r\nyourself? I am sure you would not be so cruel if you knew that I was\r\naching to see you.\" Aching! Cynthia repeated the word, and remembered the\r\nglimpse she had had of him in the dining room with Miss Janet Duncan.\r\n\"Whenever I have been free\" (Cynthia repeated this also, somewhat\r\nironically, although she conceded it the merit of frankness), \"Whenever I\r\nhave been free, I have haunted the corridors for a sight of you. Think of\r\nme as haunting the hotel desk for an answer to this, telling me when I\r\ncan see you--and where. P.S. I shall be around all evening.\" And it was\r\nsigned, \"Your friend and playmate, R. Worthington.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a fact--not generally known--that Cynthia did answer the\r\nletter--twice. But she sent neither answer. Even at that age she was\r\ngiven to reflection, and much as she may have approved of the spirit of\r\nthe letter, she liked the tone of it less. Cynthia did not know a great\r\ndeal of the world, it is true, but the felt instinctively that something\r\nwas wrong when Bob resorted to such means of communication. And she was\r\npositively relieved, or thought that she was, when she went down to\r\nsupper and discovered that the table in the corner was empty.\r\n\r\nAfter supper Ephraim had his letter to write, and Jethro wished to sit in\r\nthe corridor. But Cynthia had learned that the corridor was not the place\r\nfor a girl, so she explained--to Jethro that he would find her in the\r\nparlor if he wanted her, and that she was going there to read. That\r\nparlor Cynthia thought a handsome room, with its high windows and lace\r\ncurtains, its long mirrors and marble-topped tables. She established\r\nherself under a light, on a sofa in one corner, and sat, with the book on\r\nher lap watching the people who came and went. She had that delicious\r\nsensation which comes to the young when they first travel--the sensation\r\nof being a part of the great world; and she wished that she knew these\r\npeople, and which were the great, and which the little ones. Some of them\r\nlooked at her intently, she thought too intently, and at such times she\r\npretended to read. She was aroused by hearing some one saying:--\"Isn't\r\nthis Miss Wetherell?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia looked up and caught her breath, for the young lady who had\r\nspoken was none other than Miss Janet Duncan herself. Seen thus\r\nstartlingly at close range, Miss Duncan was not at all like what Cynthia\r\nhad expected--but then most people are not. Janet Duncan was, in fact,\r\none of those strange persons who do not realize the picture which their\r\nnames summon up. She was undoubtedly good-looking; her hair, of a more\r\ngolden red than her brother's, was really wonderful; her neck was\r\nslender; and she had a strange, dreamy face that fascinated Cynthia, who\r\nhad never seen anything like it.\r\n\r\nShe put down her book on the sofa and got up, not without a little tremor\r\nat this unexpected encounter.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm Cynthia Wetherell,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nTo add to her embarrassment, Miss Duncan seized both her hands\r\nimpulsively and gazed into her face.\r\n\r\n\"You're really very beautiful,\" she said. \"Do you know it?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia's only answer to this was a blush. She wondered if all city girls\r\nwere like Miss Duncan.\r\n\r\n\"I was determined to come up and speak to you the first chance I had,\"\r\nJanet continued. \"I've been making up stories about you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stories!\" exclaimed Cynthia, drawing away her hands.\r\n\r\n\"Romances,\" said Miss Duncan--\"real romances. Sometimes I think I'm going\r\nto be a novelist, because I'm always weaving stories about people that I\r\nsee people who interest me, I mean. And you look as if you might be the\r\nheroine of a wonderful romance.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia's breath was now quite taken away.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"I--had never thought that I looked like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you do,\" said Miss Duncan; \"you've got all sorts of possibilities in\r\nyour face--you look as if you might have lived for ages.\"\r\n\r\n\"As old as that?\" exclaimed Cynthia, really startled.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I don't express myself very well\" said the other, hastily; \"I\r\nwish you could see what I've written about you already. I can do it so\r\nmuch better with pen and ink. I've started quite a romance already.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Cynthia, not without interest.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down on the sofa and I'll tell you,\" said Miss Duncan; \"I've done it\r\nall from your face, too. I've made you a very poor girl brought up by\r\npeasants, only you are really of a great family, although nobody knows\r\nit. A rich duke sees you one day when he is hunting and falls in love\r\nwith you, and you have to stand a lot of suffering and persecution\r\nbecause of it, and say nothing. I believe you could do that,\" added\r\nJanet, looking critically at Cynthia's face.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I could if I had to,\" said Cynthia, \"but I shouldn't like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it would do you good,\" said Janet; \"it would ennoble your character.\r\nNot that it needs it,\" she added hastily. \"And I could write another\r\nstory about that quaint old man who paid the musicians to go away, and\r\nwho made us all laugh so much.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia's eye kindled.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bass isn't a quaint old man,\" she said; \"he's the greatest man in\r\nthe state.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Duncan's patronage had been of an unconscious kind. She knew that\r\nshe had offended, but did not quite realize how.\r\n\r\n\"I'm so sorry,\" she cried, \"I didn't mean to hurt you. You live with him,\r\ndon't you--Coniston?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Cynthia, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard about Coniston. It must be quite a romance in itself to live\r\nall the year round in such a beautiful place and to make your own\r\nclothes. Yours become you very well,\" said Miss Duncan, \"although I don't\r\nknow why. They're not at all in style, and yet they give you quite an air\r\nof distinction. I wish I could live in Coniston for a year, anyway, and\r\nwrite a book about you. My brother and Bob Worthington went out there one\r\nnight and serenaded you, didn't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Cynthia, that peculiar flash coming into her eyes again, \"and\r\nI think it was very foolish of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you?\" exclaimed Miss Duncan, in surprise; \"I wish somebody would\r\nserenade me. I think it was the most romantic thing Bob ever did. He's\r\nwild about you, and so is Somers they have both told me so in\r\nconfidence.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia's face was naturally burning now.\r\n\r\n\"If it were true,\" she said, \"they wouldn't have told you about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that's so,\" said Miss Duncan, thoughtfully, \"only you're very\r\nclever to have seen it. Now that I know you, I think you a more\r\nremarkable person than ever. You don't seem at all like a country girl,\r\nand you don't talk like one.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia laughed outright. She could not help liking Janet Duncan, mere\r\nflesh and blood not being proof against such compliments.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it's because my father was an educated man,\" she said; \"he\r\ntaught me to read and speak when I was young.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you are just like a person out of a novel! Who was your father?\"\r\n\r\n\"He kept the store at Coniston,\" answered Cynthia, smiling a little\r\nsadly. She would have liked to have added that William Wetherell would\r\nhave been a great man if he had had health, but she found it difficult to\r\ngive out confidences, especially when they were in the nature of\r\nsurmises.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Janet, stoutly, \"I think that is more like a story than\r\never. Do you know,\" she continued, \"I saw you once at the state capital\r\noutside of our grounds the day Bob ran after you. That was when I was in\r\nlove with him. We had just come back from Europe then, and I thought he\r\nwas the most wonderful person I had ever seen.\"\r\n\r\nIf Cynthia had felt any emotion from this disclosure, she did not betray\r\nit. Janet, moreover, was not looking for it.\r\n\r\n\"What made you change your mind?\" asked Cynthia, biting her lip.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Bob hasn't the temperament,\" said Janet, making use of a word that\r\nshe had just discovered; \"he's too practical--he never does or says the\r\nthings you want him to. He's just been out West with us on a trip, and he\r\nwas always looking at locomotives and brakes and grades and bridges and\r\nall such tiresome things. I should like to marry a poet,\" said Miss\r\nDuncan, dreamily; \"I know they want me to marry Bob, and Mr. Worthington\r\nwants it. I'm sure, of that. But he wouldn't at all suit me.\"\r\n\r\nIf Cynthia had been able to exercise an equal freedom of speech, she\r\nmight have been impelled to inquire what young Mr. Worthington's views\r\nwere in the matter. As it was, she could think of nothing appropriate to\r\nsay, and just then four people entered the room and came towards them.\r\nTwo of these were Janet's mother and father, and the other two were Mr.\r\nWorthington, the elder, and the Honorable Heth Sutton. Mrs. Duncan, whom\r\nJanet did not at all resemble was a person who naturally commanded\r\nattention. She had strong features, and a very decided, though not\r\ndisagreeable, manner.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't imagine what had become of you, Janet,\" she said, coming\r\nforward and throwing off her lace shawl. \"Whom have you found--a school\r\nfriend?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Mamma,\" said Janet, \"this is Cynthia Wetherell.\" \"Oh,\" said Mrs.\r\nDuncan, looking very hard at Cynthia in a near-sighted way, and, not\r\nknowing in the least who she was; \"you haven't seen Senator and Mrs.\r\nMeade, have you, Janet? They were to be here at eight o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Janet, turning again to Cynthia and scarcely hearing the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\"Janet hasn't seen them, Dudley,\" said Mrs. Duncan, going up to Mr.\r\nWorthington, who was pulling his chop whiskers by the door. \"Janet has\r\ndiscovered such a beautiful creature,\" she went on, in a voice which she\r\ndid not take the trouble to lower. \"Do look at her, Alexander. And you,\r\nMr. Sutton--who are such a bureau of useful information, do tell me who\r\nshe is. Perhaps she comes from your part of the country--her name's\r\nWetherell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wetherell? Why, of course I know her,\" said Mr. Sutton, who was greatly\r\npleased because Mrs. Duncan had likened him to an almanac: greatly\r\npleased this evening in every respect, and even the diamond in his bosom\r\nseemed to glow with a brighter fire. He could afford to be generous\r\nto-night, and he turned to Mr. Worthington and laughed knowingly. \"She's\r\nthe ward of our friend Jethro,\" he explained.\r\n\r\n\"What is she?\" demanded Mrs. Duncan, who knew and cared nothing about\r\npolitics, a country girl, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Mr. Sutton, \"a country girl from a little village not far\r\nfrom Clovelly. A good girl, I believe, in spite of the atmosphere in\r\nwhich she has been raised.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's really wonderful, Mr. Sutton, how you seem to know every one in\r\nyour district, including the women and children,\" said the lady; \"but I\r\nsuppose you wouldn't be where you are if you didn't.\"\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Heth cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n\"Wetherell,\" Mr. Duncan was saying, staring at Cynthia through his\r\nspectacles, \"where have I heard that name?\"\r\n\r\nHe must suddenly have remembered, and recalled also that he and his ally\r\nWorthington had been on opposite sides in the Woodchuck Session, for he\r\nsat down abruptly beside the door, and remained there for a while. For\r\nMr. Duncan had never believed Mr. Merrill's explanation concerning poor\r\nWilliam Wetherell' s conduct.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty, ain't she?\" said Mr. Sutton to Mr. Worthington. \"Guess she's\r\nmore dangerous than Jethro, now that we've clipped his wings a little.\"\r\nThe congressman had heard of Bob's infatuation.\r\n\r\nIsaac D. Worthington, however, was in a good humor this evening and was\r\nmoved by a certain curiosity to inspect the girl. Though what he had seen\r\nand heard of his son's conduct with her had annoyed him, he did not\r\nregard it seriously.\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you going to speak to your constituent, Mr. Sutton?\" said Mrs.\r\nDuncan, who was bored because her friends had not arrived; \"a congressman\r\nought to keep on the right side of the pretty girls, you know.\"\r\n\r\nIt hadn't occurred to the Honorable Heth to speak to his constituent. The\r\nways of Mrs. Duncan sometimes puzzled him, and he could not see why that\r\nlady and her daughter seemed to take more than a passing interest in the\r\ngirl. But if they could afford to notice her, certainly he could; so he\r\nwent forward graciously and held out his hand to Cynthia; interrupting\r\nMiss Duncan in the middle of a discourse upon her diary.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Cynthia?\" said Mr. Sutton. Had he been in Coniston, he\r\nwould have said, \"How be you?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia took the hand, but did not rise, somewhat to Mr. Sutton's\r\nannoyance. A certain respect was due to a member of Congress and the\r\nRajah of Clovelly.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Mr. Sutton?\" said Cynthia, very coolly.\r\n\r\n\"I like her,\" remarked Mrs. Duncan to Mr. Worthington.\r\n\r\n\"This is a splendid trip for you, eh, Cynthia?\" Mr. Sutton persisted,\r\nwith a praiseworthy determination to be pleasant.\r\n\r\n\"It has turned out to be so, Mr. Sutton,\" replied Cynthia. This was not\r\nprecisely the answer Mr. Sutton expected, and to tell the truth, he\r\ndidn't know quite what to make of it.\r\n\r\n\"A great treat to see Washington and New York, isn't it?\" said Mr.\r\nSutton, kindly, \"a great treat for a Coniston girl. I suppose you came\r\nthrough New York and saw the sights?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there another way to get to Washington?\" asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\nMrs. Duncan nudged Mr. Worthington and drew a little nearer, while Mr.\r\nSutton began to wish he had not been lured into the conversation. Cynthia\r\nhad been very polite, but there was something in the quiet manner in\r\nwhich the girl's eyes were fixed upon him that made him vaguely uneasy.\r\nHe could not back out with dignity, and he felt himself on the verge of\r\nbecoming voluble. Mr. Sutton prided himself on never being voluble.\r\n\r\n\"Why, no,\" he answered, \"we have to go to New York to get anywhere in\r\nthese days.\" There was a slight pause. \"Uncle Jethro taking you and Mr.\r\nPrescott on a little pleasure trip?\" He had not meant to mention Jethro's\r\nname, but he found himself, to his surprise, a little at a loss for a\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\"Well, partly a pleasure trip. It's always a pleasure for Uncle Jethro to\r\ndo things for others,\" said Cynthia, quietly, \"although people do not\r\nalways appreciate what he does for them.\"\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Heth coughed. He was now very uncomfortable, indeed. How\r\nmuch did this astounding young person know, whom he had thought so\r\ninnocent?\r\n\r\n\"I didn't discover he was in town until I ran across him in the corridor\r\nthis evening. Should have liked to have introduced him to some of the\r\nWashington folks--some of the big men, although not many of 'em are\r\nhere,\" Mr. Sutton ran on, not caring to notice the little points of light\r\nin Cynthia's eyes. (The idea of Mr. Sutton introducing Uncle Jethro to\r\nanybody!) \"I haven't seen Ephraim Prescott. It must be a great treat for\r\nhim, too, to get away on a little trip and see his army friends. How is\r\nhe?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's very happy,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Happy!\" exclaimed Mr. Sutton. \"Oh, yes, of course, Ephraim's always\r\nhappy, in spite of his troubles and his rheumatism. I always liked\r\nEphraim Prescott.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia did not answer this remark at all, and Mr. Sutton suspected\r\nstrongly that she did not believe it, therefore he repeated it.\r\n\r\n\"I always liked Ephraim. I want you to tell Jethro that I'm downright\r\nsorry I couldn't get him that Brampton postmastership.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell him that you are sorry, Mr. Sutton,\" replied Cynthia, gravely,\r\n\"but I don't think it'll do any good.\"\r\n\r\nNot do any good!--What did the girl mean? Mr. Sutton came to the\r\nconclusion that he had been condescending enough, that somehow he was\r\ngaining no merit in Mrs. Duncan's eyes by this kindness to a constituent.\r\nHe buttoned up his coat rather grandly.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you won't misunderstand me, Cynthia,\" he said. \"I regret\r\nextremely that my sense of justice demanded that I should make David\r\nWheelock postmaster at Brampton, and I have made him so.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now Cynthia's turn to be amazed.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" she exclaimed, \"but Cousin Ephraim is postmaster of Brampton.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sutton started violently, and that part of his face not hidden by his\r\nwhiskers seemed to pale, and Mr: Worthington, usually self-possessed,\r\ntook a step forward and seized him by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"What does this mean, Sutton?\" he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Sutton pulled himself together, and glared at Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"I think you are mistaken,\" said he, \"the congressman of the district\r\nusually arranges these matters, and the appointment will be sent to Mr.\r\nWheelock to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Cousin Ephraim already has the appointment,\" said Cynthia; \"it was\r\nsent to him this afternoon, and he is up in his room now writing to thank\r\nthe President for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What in the world's the matter?\" cried Mrs. Duncan, in astonishment.\r\n\r\nCynthia's simple announcement had indeed caused something of a panic\r\namong the gentlemen present. Mr. Duncan had jumped up from his seat\r\nbeside the door, and Mr. Worthington, his face anything but impassive,\r\ntightened his hold on the congressman's arm.\r\n\r\n\"Good God, Sutton!\" he exclaimed, \"can this be true?\"\r\n\r\nAs for Cynthia, she was no less astonished than Mrs. Duncan. by the fact\r\nthat these rich and powerful gentlemen were so excited over a little\r\nthing like the postmastership of Brampton. But Mr. Sutton laughed; it was\r\nnot hearty, but still it might have passed muster for a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" he exclaimed, making a fair attempt to regain his composure,\r\n\"the girl's got it mixed up with something else--she doesn't know what\r\nshe's talking about.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Duncan thought the girl did look uncommonly as if she knew what she\r\nwas talking about, and Mr. Duncan and Mr. Worthington had some such\r\nimpression, too, as they stared at her. Cynthia's eyes flashed, but her\r\nvoice was no louder than before.\r\n\r\n\"I am used to being believed, Mr. Sutton,\" she said, \"but here's Uncle\r\nJethro himself. You might ask him.\"\r\n\r\nThey all turned in amazement, and one, at least, in trepidation, to\r\nperceive Jethro Bass standing behind them with his hands in his pockets,\r\nas unconcerned as though he were under the butternut tree in Coniston.\r\n\r\n\"How be you, Heth?\" he said. \"Er--still got that appointment\r\np-practically in your pocket?\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro,\" said Cynthia, \"Mr. Sutton does not believe me when I tell\r\nhim that Cousin Ephraim has been made postmaster of Brampton. He would\r\nlike to have you tell him whether it is so or not.\"\r\n\r\nBut this, as it happened, was exactly what the Honorable Heth did not\r\nwant to have Jethro tell him. How he got out of the parlor of the Willard\r\nHouse he has not to this day a very clear idea. As a matter of fact, he\r\nfollowed Mr. Worthington and Mr. Duncan, and they made their exit by the\r\nfarther door. Jethro did not appear to take any notice of their\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\n\"Janet,\" said Mrs. Duncan, \"I think Senator and Mrs. Meade must have gone\r\nto our sitting room.\" Then, to Cynthia's surprise, the lady took her by\r\nthe hand. \"I can't imagine what you've done, my dear,\" she said\r\npleasantly, \"but I believe that you are capable of taking care of\r\nyourself, and I like you.\"\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that Mrs. Duncan was an independent person.\r\nSometimes heiresses are apt to be.\r\n\r\n\"And I like you, too,\" said Janet, taking both of Cynthia's hands, \"and I\r\nhope to see you very, very often.\"\r\n\r\nJethro looked after them.\r\n\r\n\"Er--the women folks seem to have some sense,\" he said. Then he turned to\r\nCynthia. \"B-be'n havin' some fun with Heth, Cynthy?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't any respect for Mr. Sutton,\" said Cynthia, indignantly; \"it\r\nserves him right for presuming to think that he could give a post-office\r\nto any one.\"\r\n\r\nJethro made no remark concerning this presumption on the part of the\r\ncongressman of the district. Cynthia's indignation against Mr. Sutton was\r\nvery real, and it was some time before she could compose herself\r\nsufficiently to tell Jethro what had happened. His enjoyment as he\r\nlistened may be imagined but presently he forgot this, and became aware\r\nthat something really troubled her.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro,\" she asked suddenly, \"why do they treat me as they do?\"\r\n\r\nHe did not answer at once. This was because of a pain around his\r\nheart--had she known it. He had felt that pain before.\r\n\r\n\"H-how do they treat you, Cynthy?\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. She had not yet learned to use the word patronize in the\r\nsocial sense, and she was at a loss to describe the attitude of Mrs.\r\nDuncan and her daughter, though her instinct had registered it. She was\r\nat a loss to account for Mr. Worthington's attitude, too. Mr. Sutton's\r\nshe bitterly resented.\r\n\r\n\"Are they your enemies?\" she demanded.\r\n\r\nJethro was in real distress.\r\n\r\n\"If they are,\" she continued, \"I won't speak to them again. If they can't\r\ntreat me as--as your daughter ought to be treated, I'll turn my back on\r\nthem. I am--I am just like your daughter--am I not, Uncle Jethro?\"\r\n\r\nHe put out his hand and seized hers roughly, and his voice was thick with\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Cynthy,\" he said, \"you--you're all I've got in the world.\"\r\n\r\nShe squeezed his hand in return.\r\n\r\n\"I know it, Uncle Jethro,\" she cried contritely, \"I oughtn't to have\r\ntroubled you by asking. You--you have done everything for me, much more\r\nthan I deserve. And I shan't be hurt after this when people are too small\r\nto appreciate how good you are, and how great.\"\r\n\r\nThe pain tightened about Jethro's heart--tightened so sharply that he\r\ncould not speak, and scarcely breathe because of it. Cynthia picked up\r\nher novel, and set the bookmark.\r\n\r\n\"Now that Cousin Eph is provided for, let's go back to Coniston, Uncle\r\nJethro.\" A sudden longing was upon her for the peaceful life in the\r\nshelter of the great ridge, and she thought of the village maples all red\r\nand gold with the magic touch of the frosts. \"Not that I haven't enjoyed\r\nmy trip,\" she added; \"but we are so happy there.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not look at her, because he was afraid to.\r\n\r\n\"C-Cynthy,\" he said, after a little pause, \"th-thought we'd go to\r\nBoston.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boston, Uncle Jethro!\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--to-morrow--at one--to-morrow--like to go to Boston?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said thoughtfully, \"I remember parts of it. The Common, where\r\nI used to walk with Daddy, and the funny old streets that went uphill. It\r\nwill be nice to go back to Coniston that way--over Truro Pass in the\r\ntrain.\"\r\n\r\nThat night a piece of news flashed over the wires to New England, and the\r\nnext morning a small item appeared in the Newcastle Guardian to the\r\neffect that one Ephraim Prescott had bean appointed postmaster at\r\nBrampton. Copied in the local papers of the state, it caused some\r\nsurprise in Brampton, to be sure, and excitement in Coniston. Perhaps\r\nthere were but a dozen men, however, who saw its real significance, who\r\nknew through this item that Jethro Bass was still supreme--that the\r\nrailroads had failed to carry this first position in their war against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt was with a light heart the next morning that Cynthia, packed the\r\nlittle leather trunk which had been her father's. Ephraim was in the\r\ncorridor regaling his friend, Mr. Beard, with that wonderful encounter\r\nwith General Grant which sounded so much like a Fifth Reader anecdote of\r\na chance meeting with royalty. Jethro's room was full of visiting\r\npoliticians. So Cynthia, when she had finished her packing, went out to\r\nwalk about the streets alone, scanning the people who passed her, looking\r\nat the big houses, and wondering who lived in them. Presently she found\r\nherself, in the middle of the morning, seated on a bench in a little\r\npark, surrounded by colored mammies and children playing in the paths. It\r\nseemed a long time since she had left the hills, and this glimpse of\r\ncities had given her many things to think and dream about. Would she\r\nalways live in Coniston? Or was her future to be cast among those who\r\nmoved in the world and helped to sway it? Cynthia felt that she was to be\r\nof these, though she could not reason why, and she told herself that the\r\nfeeling was foolish. Perhaps it was that she knew in the bottom of her\r\nheart that she had been given a spirit and intelligence to cope with a\r\nlarger life than that of Coniston. With a sense that such imaginings were\r\nvain, she tried to think what the would do if she were to become a great\r\nlady like Mrs. Duncan.\r\n\r\nShe was aroused from these reflections by a distant glimpse, through the\r\ntrees, of Mr. Robert Worthington. He was standing quite alone on the edge\r\nof the park, his hands in his pockets, staring at the White House.\r\nCynthia half rose, and then sat down and looked at him again. He wore a\r\nlight gray, loose-fitting suit and a straw hat, and she could not but\r\nacknowledge that there was something stalwart and clean and altogether\r\nappealing in him. She wondered, indeed, why he now failed to appeal to\r\nMiss Duncan, and she began to doubt the sincerity of that young lady's\r\nstatements. Bob certainly was not romantic, but he was a man--or would be\r\nvery soon.\r\n\r\nCynthia sat still, although her impulse was to go away. She scarcely\r\nanalyzed her feeling of wishing to avoid him. It may not be well, indeed,\r\nto analyze them on paper too closely. She had an instinct that only pain\r\ncould come from frequent meetings, and she knew now what but a week ago\r\nwas a surmise, that he belonged to the world of which she had been\r\ndreaming--Mrs. Duncan's world. Again, there was that mysterious barrier\r\nbetween them of which she had seen so many evidences. And yet she sat\r\nstill on her bench and looked at him.\r\n\r\nPresently he turned, slowly, as if her eyes had compelled his. She sat\r\nstill--it was too late, then. In less than a minute he was standing\r\nbeside her, looking down at her with a smile that had in it a touch of\r\nreproach.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Mr. Worthington?\" said Cynthia, quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Worthington!\" he cried, \"you haven't called me that before. We are\r\nnot children any more,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"What difference does that make?\"\r\n\r\n\"A great deal,\" said Cynthia, not caring to define it.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia,\" said Mr. Worthington, sitting down on the beach and facing\r\nher, \"do you think you've treated me just right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I do,\" she said, \"or I should have treated you differently.\"\r\n\r\nBob ignored such quibbling.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you run away from that baseball game in Brampton? And why\r\ncouldn't you have answered my letter yesterday, if it were only a line?\r\nAnd why have you avoided me here in Washington?\"\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to answer for another questions which one cannot\r\nanswer for one's self.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't avoided you,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"I've been looking for you all over town this morning,\" said Bob, with\r\npardonable exaggeration, \"and I believe that idiot Somers has, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why should you call him an idiot?\" Cynthia flashed.\r\n\r\nBob laughed.\r\n\r\n\"How you do catch a fellow up!\" said he; admiringly. \"We both found out\r\nyou'd gone out for a walk alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you find it out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Bob, hesitating, \"we asked the colored doorkeeper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Worthington,\" said Cynthia, with an indignation that made him quail,\r\n\"do you think it right to ask a doorkeeper to spy on my movements?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, Cynthia,\" he gasped, \"I--I didn't think of it that way--and\r\nhe won't tell. Desperate cases require desperate remedies, you know.\"\r\n\r\nBut Cynthia was not appeased.\r\n\r\n\"If you wanted to see me,\" she said, \"why didn't you send your card to my\r\nroom, and I would have come to the parlor.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I did send a note, and waited around all day.\"\r\n\r\nHow was she to tell him that it was to the tone of the note she\r\nobjected--to the hint of a clandestine meeting? She turned the light of\r\nher eyes full upon him.\r\n\r\n\"Would you have been content to see me in the parlor?\" she asked. \"Did\r\nyou mean to see me there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes,\" said he; \"I would have given my head to see you anywhere,\r\nonly--\"\r\n\r\n\"Only what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Duncan might have came in and spoiled it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spoiled what?\"\r\n\r\nBob fidgeted.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Cynthia,\" he said, \"you're not stupid--far from it. Of course\r\nyou know a fellow would rather talk to you alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have been very glad to have seen Mr. Duncan, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would, would you!\" he exclaimed. \"I shouldn't have thought that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't he your friend?\" asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Bob, \"and one of the best in the world. Only--I shouldn't\r\nhave thought you'd care to talk to him.\" And he looked around for fear\r\nthe vigilant Mr. Duncan was already in the park and had discovered them.\r\nCynthia smiled, and immediately became grave again.\r\n\r\n\"So it was only on Mr. Duncan's account that you didn't ask me to come\r\ndown to the parlor?\" she said.\r\n\r\nBob was in a quandary. He was a truthful person, and he had learned\r\nsomething of the world through his three years at Cambridge. He had seen\r\nmany young women, and many kinds of them. But the girl beside him was\r\nsuch a mixture of innocence and astuteness that he was wholly at a loss\r\nhow to deal with her--how to parry her searching questions.\r\n\r\n\"Naturally--I wanted to have you all to myself,\" he said; \"you ought to\r\nknow that.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia did not commit herself on this point. She wished to go\r\nmercilessly to the root of the matter, but the notion of what this would\r\nimply prevented her. Bob took advantage of her silence.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody who sees you falls a victim, Cynthia,\" he went on; \"Mrs.\r\nDuncan and Janet lost their hearts. You ought to have heard them praising\r\nyou at breakfast.\" He paused abruptly, thinking of the rest of that\r\nconversation, and laughed. Bob seemed fated to commit himself that day.\r\n\"I heard the way you handled Heth Sutton,\" he said, plunging in. \"I'll\r\nbet he felt as if he'd been dropped out of the third-story window,\" and\r\nBob laughed again. \"I'd have given a thousand dollars to have been there.\r\nSomers and I went out to supper with a classmate who lives in Washington,\r\nin that house over there,\" and he pointed casually to one of the imposing\r\nmansions fronting on the park. \"Mrs. Duncan said she'd never heard\r\nanybody lay it on the way you did. I don't believe you half know what\r\nhappened, Cynthia. You made a ten-strike.\"\r\n\r\n\"A ten-strike?\" she repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, \"you not only laid out Heth, but my father and Mr.\r\nDuncan, too. Mrs. Duncan laughed at 'em--she isn't afraid of anything.\r\nBut they didn't say a word all through breakfast. I've never seen my\r\nfather so mad. He ought to have known better than to run up against Uncle\r\nJethro.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did they run up against Uncle Jethro?\" asked Cynthia, now keenly\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know?\" exclaimed Bob, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Cynthia, \"or I shouldn't have asked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't Uncle Jethro tell you about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"He never tells me anything about his affairs,\" she answered.\r\n\r\nBob's astonishment did not wear off at once. Here was a new phase, and he\r\nwas very hard put. He had heard, casually, a good deal of abuse of Jethro\r\nand his methods in the last two days.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I don't know anything about politics. I don't know\r\nmyself why father and Mr. Duncan were so eager for this post-mastership.\r\nBut they were. And I heard them say something about the President going\r\nback on them when they had telegraphed from Chicago and come to see him\r\nhere. And maybe they didn't let Heth in for it. It seems Uncle Jethro\r\nonly had to walk up to the White House. They ought to have sense enough\r\nto know that he runs the state. But what's the use of wasting time over\r\nthis business?\" said Bob. \"I told you I was going to Brampton before the\r\nterm begins just to see you, didn't I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I didn't believe you,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Because it's my nature, I suppose,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for Bob, exasperated though he was, and he burst into\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\"You're the queerest girl I've ever known,\" he said.\r\n\r\nNot a very original remark.\r\n\r\n\"That must be saying a great deal,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must have known many.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have,\" he admitted, \"and none of 'em, no matter how much they'd\r\nknocked about, were able to look out for themselves any better than you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not even Cassandra Hopkins?\" Cynthia could not resist saying. She saw\r\nthat she had scored; his expressions registered his sensations so\r\naccurately.\r\n\r\n\"What do you know about her?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said Cynthia, mysteriously, \"I heard that you were very fond of her\r\nat Andover.\"\r\n\r\nBob could not help pluming himself a little. He thought the fact that she\r\nhad mentioned the matter a flaw in Cynthia's armor, as indeed it was. And\r\nyet he was not proud of the Cassandra Hopkins episode in his career.\r\n\r\n\"Cassandra is one of the institutions at Andover,\" said he; \"most fellows\r\nhave to take a course in Cassandra to complete their education.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yours seems to be very complete,\" Cynthia retorted.\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott!\" he exclaimed, looking at her, \"no wonder you made\r\nmince-meat of the Honorable Heth. Where did you learn it all, Cynthia?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia did not know. She merely wondered where she would be if she\r\nhadn't learned it. Something told her that if it were not for this anchor\r\nshe would be drifting out to sea: might, indeed, soon be drifting out to\r\nsea in spite of it. It was one thing for Mr. Robert Worthington, with his\r\nnumerous resources, to amuse himself with a girl in her position; it\r\nwould be quite another thing for the girl. She got to her feet and held\r\nout her hand to him.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are leaving Washington at one o'clock, and Uncle Jethro will be\r\nworried if I am not in time for dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leaving at one! That's the worst luck I've had yet. But I'm going back\r\nto the hotel myself.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia didn't see how she was to prevent him walking with her. She would\r\nnot have admitted to herself that she had enjoyed this encounter, since\r\nshe was trying so hard not to enjoy it. So they started together out of\r\nthe park. Bob, for a wonder, was silent awhile, glancing now and then at\r\nher profile. He knew that he had a great deal to say, but he couldn't\r\ndecide exactly what it was to be. This is often the case with young men\r\nin his state of mind: in fact, to be paradoxical again, he might hardly\r\nbe said at this time to have had a state of mind. He lacked both an\r\nattitude and a policy.\r\n\r\n\"If you see Duncan before I do, let me know,\" he remarked finally.\r\n\r\nCynthia bit her lip. \"Why should I?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Because we've only got five minutes more alone together, at best. If we\r\nsee him in time, we can go down a side street.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it would be hard to get away from Mr. Duncan if we met him--even\r\nif we wanted to,\" she said, laughing outright.\r\n\r\n\"You don't know how true that is,\" he replied, with feeling.\r\n\r\n\"That sounds as though you'd tried it before.\"\r\n\r\nHe paid no attention to this thrust.\r\n\r\n\"I shan't see you again till I get to Brampton,\" he said; \"that will be a\r\nwhole week. And then,\" he ventured to look at her, \"I shan't see you\r\nuntil the Christmas holidays. You might be a little kind, Cynthia. You\r\nknow I've--I've always thought the world of you. I don't know how I'm\r\ngoing to get through the three months without seeing you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You managed to get through a good many years,\" said Cynthia, looking at\r\nthe pavement.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" he said; \"I was sent away to school and college, and our lives\r\nseparated.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, our lives separated,\" she assented.\r\n\r\n\"And I didn't know you were going to be like--like this,\" he went on,\r\nvaguely enough, but with feeling.\r\n\r\n\"Like what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like--well, I'd rather be with you and talk to you than any girl I ever\r\nsaw. I don't care who she is,\" Bob declared, \"or how much she may have\r\ntraveled.\" He was running into deep water. \"Why are you so cold,\r\nCynthia?\" \"Why can't you be as you used to be? You used to like me well\r\nenough.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I like you now,\" answered Cynthia. They were very near the hotel by\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\n\"You talk as if you were ten years older than I,\" he said, smiling\r\nplaintively.\r\n\r\nShe stopped and turned to him, smiling. They had reached the steps.\r\n\r\n\"I believe I am, Bob,\" she replied. \"I haven't seen much of the world,\r\nbut I've seen something of its troubles. Don't be foolish. If you're\r\ncoming to Brampton just to see me, don't come. Good-by.\" And she gave him\r\nher hand frankly.\r\n\r\n\"But I will come to Brampton,\" he cried, taking her hand and squeezing\r\nit. \"I'd like to know why I shouldn't come.\"\r\n\r\nAs Cynthia drew her hand away a gentleman came out of the hotel, paused\r\nfor a brief moment by the door and stared at them, and then passed on\r\nwithout a word or a nod of recognition. It was Mr. Worthington. Bob\r\nlooked after his father, and then glanced at Cynthia. There was a trifle\r\nmore color in her cheeks, and her head was raised a little, and her eyes\r\nwere fixed upon him gravely.\r\n\r\n\"You should know why not,\" she said, and before he could answer her she\r\nwas gone into the hotel. He did not attempt to follow her, but stood\r\nwhere she had left him in the sunlight.\r\n\r\nHe was aroused by the voice of the genial colored doorkeeper.\r\n\r\n\"Wal, suh, you found the lady, Mistah Wo'thington. Thought you would,\r\nsuh. T'other young gentleman come in while ago--looked as if he was\r\nfeelin' powerful bad, Mistah Wo'thington.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nWhen they reached Boston, Cynthia felt almost as if she were home again,\r\nand Ephraim declared that he had had the same feeling when he returned\r\nfrom the war. Though it be the prosperous capital of New England, it is a\r\ncity of homes, and the dwellers of it have held stanchly to the belief of\r\ntheir forefathers that the home is the very foundation-rock of the\r\nnation. Held stanchly to other beliefs, too: that wealth carries with it\r\nsome little measure of responsibility. The stranger within the gates of\r\nthat city feels that if he falls, a heedless world will not go charging\r\nover his body: that a helping hand will be stretched out,--a helping and\r\na wise hand that will inquire into the circumstances of his fall--but\r\nstill a human hand.\r\n\r\nThey were sitting in the parlor of the Tremont House that morning with\r\nthe sun streaming in the windows, waiting for Ephraim.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro,\" Cynthia asked, abruptly, \"did you ever know my mother?\"\r\n\r\nJethro started, and looked at her quickly.\r\n\r\n\"W-why, Cynthy?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Because she grew up in Coniston,\" answered Cynthia. \"I never thought of\r\nit before, but of course you must have known her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I knew her,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Did you know her well?\" she persisted.\r\n\r\nJethro got up and went over to the window, where he stood with his back\r\ntoward her.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Cynthy,\" he answered at length.\r\n\r\n\"Why haven't you ever told me about her?\" asked Cynthia. How was she to\r\nknow that her innocent questions tortured him cruelly; that the spirit of\r\nthe Cynthia who had come to him in the tannery house had haunted him all\r\nhis life, and that she herself, a new Cynthia, was still that spirit? The\r\nbygone Cynthia had been much in his thoughts since they came to Boston.\r\n\r\n\"What was she like?\"\r\n\r\n\"She--she was like you, Cynthy,\" he said, but he did not turn round. \"She\r\nwas a clever woman, and a good woman, and--a lady, Cynthy.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl said nothing for a while, but she tingled with pleasure because\r\nJethro had compared her to her mother. She determined to try to be like\r\nthat, if he thought her so.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro,\" she said presently, \"I'd like to go to see the house\r\nwhere she lived.\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--Ephraim knows it,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\nSo when Ephraim came the three went over the hill; past the State House\r\nwhich Bulfinch set as a crown on the crest of it looking over the sweep\r\nof the Common, and on into the maze of quaint, old-world streets on the\r\nslope beyond: streets with white porticos, and violet panes in the\r\nwindows. They came to an old square hidden away on a terrace of the hill,\r\nand after that the streets grew narrower and dingier. Ephraim, whose\r\nmemory never betrayed him, hobbled up to a shabby house in the middle of\r\none of these blocks and rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\"Here's where I found Will when I come back from the war,\" he said, and\r\nexplained the matter in full to the slatternly landlady who came to the\r\ndoor. She was a good-natured woman, who thought her boarder would not\r\nmind, and led the way up the steep stairs to the chamber over the roofs\r\nwhere Wetherell and Cynthia had lived and hoped and worked together;\r\nwhere he had written those pages by which, with the aid of her loving\r\ncriticism, he had thought to become famous. The room was as bare now as\r\nit had been then, and Ephraim, poking his stick through a hole in the\r\ncarpet, ventured the assertion that even that had not been changed.\r\nJethro, staring out over the chimney tops, passed his hand across his\r\neyes. Cynthia Ware had come to this!\r\n\r\n\"I found him right here in that bed,\" Ephraim was saying, and he poked\r\nthe bottom boards, too. \"The same bed. Had a shack when I saw him.\r\nCallate he wouldn't have lived two months if the war hadn't bust up and I\r\nhadn't come along.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Cousin Eph!\" exclaimed Cynthia.\r\n\r\nThe old soldier turned and saw that there were tears in her eyes. But,\r\nstranger than that, Cynthia saw that there were tears in his own. He took\r\nher gently by the arm and led her down the stairs again, she supporting\r\nhim, and Jethro following.\r\n\r\nThat same morning, Jethro, whose memory was quite as good as Ephraim's,\r\nfound a little shop tucked away in Cornhill which had been miraculously\r\nspared in the advance of prosperity. Mr. Judson's name, however, was no\r\nlonger in quaint lettering over the door. Standing before it, Jethro told\r\nthe story in his droll way, of a city clerk and a country bumpkin, and\r\nCynthia and Ephraim both laughed so heartily that the people who were\r\npassing turned round to look at them and laughed too. For the three were\r\nan unusual group, even in Boston. It was not until they were seated at\r\ndinner in the hotel, Ephraim with his napkin tucked under his chin, that\r\nJethro gave them the key to the characters in this story.\r\n\r\n\"And who was the locket for, Uncle Jethro?\" demanded Cynthia.\r\n\r\nJethro, however, shook his head, and would not be induced to tell.\r\n\r\nThey were still so seated when Cynthia perceived coming toward them\r\nthrough the crowded dining roam a merry, middle-aged gentleman with a\r\nbald head. He seemed to know everybody in the room, for he was kept busy\r\nnodding right and left at the tables until he came to theirs. He was Mr.\r\nMerrill who had come to see her father in Coniston, and who had spoken so\r\nkindly to her on that occasion.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, well,\" he said; \"Jethro, you'll be the death of me yet.\r\n'Don't write-send,' eh? Well, as long as you sent word you were here, I\r\ndon't complain. So you licked 'em again, eh--down in Washington? Never\r\nhad a doubt but what you would. Is this the new postmaster? How are you,\r\nMr. Prescott--and Cynthia--a young lady! Bless my soul,\" said Mr.\r\nMerrill, looking her over as he shook her hand. \"What have you done to\r\nher, Jethro? What kind of beauty powder do they use in Coniston?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill took the seat next to her and continued to talk, scattering\r\nhis pleasantries equally among the three, patting her arm when her own\r\nturn came. She liked Mr. Merrill very much; he seemed to her (as, indeed,\r\nhe was) honest and kind-hearted. Cynthia was not lacking in a proper\r\nappreciation of herself--that may have been discovered. But she was\r\npuzzled to know why this gentleman should make it a point to pay such\r\nparticular attention to a young country girl. Other railroad presidents\r\nwhom she could name had not done so. She was thinking of these things,\r\nrather than listening to Mr. Merrill's conversation, when the sound of\r\nMr. Worthington's name startled her.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Jethro,\" Mr. Merrill was saying, \"you certainly nipped this little\r\ngame of Worthington's in the bud. Thought he'd take you in the rear by\r\ngoing to Washington, did he? Ha, ha! I'd like to know how you did it.\r\nI'll get you to tell me to-night--see if I don't. You're all coming in to\r\nsupper to-night, you know, at seven o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nEphraim laid down his knife and fork for the first time. Were the wonders\r\nof this journey never to cease? And Jethro, once in his life, looked\r\nnervous.\r\n\r\n\"Er--er--Cyn'thy'll go, Steve--Cynthy'll go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Cynthy'll go,\" laughed Mr. Merrill, \"and you'll go, and Ephraim'll\r\ngo.\" Although he by no means liked everybody, as would appear at first\r\nglance, Mr. Merrill had a way of calling people by their first names when\r\nhe did fancy them.\r\n\r\n\"Er--Steve,\" said Jethro, \"what would your wife say if I was to drink\r\ncoffee out of my saucer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's see,\" said Mr. Merrill grave for once. \"What's the punishment for\r\nthat in my house? I know what she'd do if you didn't drink it. What do\r\nyou think she'd do, Cynthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask him what was the matter with it,\" said Cynthia, promptly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Cynthy,\" said he, \"I know why these old fellows take you round\r\nwith 'em. To take care of 'em, eh? They're not fit to travel alone.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it was settled, after much further argument, that they were all to\r\nsup at Mr. Merrill's house, Cynthia stoutly maintaining that she would\r\nnot desert them. And then Mr. Merrill, having several times repeated the\r\nstreet and number, went, back to his office. There was much mysterious\r\nwhispering between Ephraim and Jethro in the hotel parlor after dinner,\r\nwhile Cynthia was turning over the leaves of a magazine, and then Ephraim\r\nproposed going out to see the sights.\r\n\r\n\"Where's Uncle Jethro going?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"He'll meet us,\" said Ephraim, promptly, but his voice was not quite\r\nsteady.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Uncle Jethro!\" cried Cynthia, \"you're trying to get out of it. You\r\nremember you promised to meet us in Washington.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess he'll keep this app'intment,\" said Ephraim, who seemed to be full\r\nof a strange mirth that bubbled over, for he actually winked at Jethro.\r\n Cynthia's mind flew to Bunker Bill and the old North Church, but they\r\nwent first to Faneuil Hall. Presently they found themselves among the\r\ncrowd in Washington Street, where Ephraim confessed the trepidation which\r\nhe felt over the coming supper party: a trepidation greater, so he\r\ndeclared many times, than he had ever experienced before any of his\r\nbattles in the war. He stopped once or twice in the eddy of the crowd to\r\nglance up at the numbers; and finally came to a halt before the windows\r\nof a large dry-goods store.\r\n\r\n\"I guess I ought to buy a new shirt for this occasion, Cynthy,\" he said,\r\nstaring hard at the articles of apparel displayed there: \"Let's go in.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia laughed outright, since Ephraim could not by any chance have worn\r\nany of the articles in question.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Cousin Ephraim,\" she exclaimed, \"you can't buy gentlemen's things\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I guess you can,\" said Ephraim, and hobbled confidently in at the\r\ndoorway. There we will leave him for a while conversing in an undertone\r\nwith a floor-walker, and follow Jethro. He, curiously enough, had some\r\nfifteen minutes before gone in at the same doorway, questioned the same\r\nfloor-walker, and he found himself in due time walking amongst a\r\nbewildering lot of models on the third floor, followed by a giggling\r\nsaleswoman.\r\n\r\n\"What kind of a dress do you want, sir?\" asked the saleslady,--for we are\r\nimpelled to call her so.\r\n\r\n\"S-silk cloth,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"What shades of silk would you like, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shades? shades? What do you mean by shades?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, colors,\" said the saleslady, giggling openly.\r\n\r\n\"Green,\" said Jethro, with considerable emphasis.\r\n\r\nThe saleslady clapped her hand over her mouth and led the way to another\r\nmodel.\r\n\r\n\"You don't call that green--do you? That's not green enough.\"\r\n\r\nThey inspected another dress, and then another and another,--not all of\r\nthem were green,--Jethro expressing very decided if not expert views on\r\neach of them. At last he paused before two models at the far end of the\r\nroom, passing his hand repeatedly over each as he had done so often with\r\nthe cattle of Coniston.\r\n\r\n\"These two pieces same kind of goods?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Er-this one is a little shinier than that one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the finish is a little higher,\" ventured the saleslady.\r\n\r\n\"Sh-shinier,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, shinier, if you please to call it so.\"\r\n\r\n\"W-what would you call it?\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the saleslady had become quite hysterical, and altogether\r\nincapable of performing her duties. Jethro looked at her for a moment in\r\ndisgust, and in his predicament cast around for another to wait on him.\r\nThere was no lack of these, at a safe distance, but they all seemed to be\r\naffected by the same mania. Jethro's eye alighted upon the back of\r\nanother customer. She was, apparently, a respectable-looking lady of\r\nuncertain age, and her own attention was so firmly fixed in the\r\ncontemplation of a model that she had not remarked the merriment about\r\nher, nor its cause. She did not see Jethro, either, as he strode across\r\nto her. Indeed, her first intimation of his presence was a dig in her\r\narm. The lady turned, gave a gasp of amazement at the figure confronting\r\nher, and proceeded to annihilate it with an eye that few women possess.\r\n\r\n\"H-how do, Ma'am,\" he said. Had he known anything about the appearance of\r\nwomen in general, he might have realized that he had struck a tartar.\r\nThis lady was at least sixty-five, and probably unmarried. Her face,\r\nthough not at all unpleasant, was a study in character-development: she\r\nwore ringlets, a peculiar bonnet of a bygone age, and her clothes had\r\ncertain eccentricities which, for, lack of knowledge, must be omitted. In\r\nshort, the lady was no fool, and not being one she glanced at the\r\ngiggling group of saleswomen and--wonderful to relate--they stopped\r\ngiggling. Then she looked again at Jethro and gave him a smile. One of\r\nsuperiority, no doubt, but still a smile.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"T-trying to buy a silk cloth gown for a woman. There's two over here I\r\nfancied a little. Er--thought perhaps you'd help me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are the dresses?\" she demanded abruptly.\r\n\r\nJethro led the way in silence until they came to the models. She planted\r\nherself in front of them and looked them over swiftly but critically.\r\n\r\n\"What is the age of the lady?\"\r\n\r\n\"W-what difference does that make?\" said Jethro, whose instinct was\r\nagainst committing himself to strangers.\r\n\r\n\"Difference!\" she exclaimed sharply, \"it makes a considerable difference.\r\nPerhaps not to you, but to the lady. What coloring is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"C-coloring? She's white.\"\r\n\r\nHis companion turned her back on him.\r\n\r\n\"What size is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"A-about that size,\" said Jethro, pointing to a model.\r\n\r\n\"About! about!\" she ejaculated, and then she faced him. \"Now look here,\r\nmy friend,\" she said vigorously, \"there's something very mysterious about\r\nall this. You look like a good man, but you may be a very wicked one for\r\nall I know. I've lived long enough to discover that appearances,\r\nespecially where your sex is concerned, are deceitful. Unless you are\r\nwilling to tell me who this lady is for whom you are buying silk dresses,\r\nand what your relationship is to her, I shall leave you. And mind, no\r\nevasions. I can detect the truth pretty well when I hear it.\"\r\n\r\nUnexpected as it was, Jethro gave back a step or two before this\r\nonslaught of feminine virtue, and the movement did not tend to raise him\r\nin the lady's esteem. He felt that he would rather face General Grant a\r\nthousand times than this person. She was, indeed, preparing to sweep away\r\nwhen there came a familiar tap-tap behind them on the bare floor, and he\r\nturned to behold Ephraim hobbling toward them with the aid of his green\r\numbrella, Cynthia by his side.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's Uncle Jethro,\" cried Cynthia, looking at him and the lady in\r\nastonishment, and then with equal astonishment at the models. \"What in\r\nthe world are you doing here?\" Then a light seemed to dawn on her.\r\n\r\n\"You frauds! So this is what you were whispering about! This is the way\r\nCousin Ephraim buys his shirts!\"\r\n\r\n\"C-Cynthy,\" said Jethro, apologetically, \"d-don't you think you ought to\r\nhave a nice city dress for that supper party?\"\r\n\r\n\"So you're ashamed of my country clothes, are you?\" she asked gayly.\r\n\r\n\"W-want you to have the best, Cynthy,\" he replied. \"I-I-meant to have it\r\nall chose and bought when you come, but I got into a kind of argument\r\nwith this lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Argument!\" exclaimed the lady. But she did not seem displeased. She had\r\nbeen staring very fixedly at Cynthia. \"My dear,\" she continued kindly,\r\n\"you look like some one I used to know a long, long time ago, and I'll be\r\nglad to help you. Your uncle may be sensible enough in other matters, but\r\nI tell him frankly he is out of place here. Let him go away and sit down\r\nsomewhere with the other gentleman, and we'll get the dress between us,\r\nif he'll tell us how much to pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"P-pay anything, so's you get it,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro, do you really want it so much?\"\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought that Cynthia did not wish for a dress, too. But\r\nthe sense of dependence on Jethro and the fear of straining his purse\r\nnever quite wore off. So Jethro and Ephraim took to a bench at some\r\ndistance, and at last a dress was chosen--not one of the gorgeous models\r\nJethro had picked out, but a pretty, simple, girlish gown which Cynthia\r\nherself had liked and of which the lady highly approved. Not content with\r\nhelping to choose it, the lady must satisfy herself that it fit, which it\r\ndid perfectly. And so Cynthia was transformed into a city person, though\r\nher skin glowed with a health with which few city people are blessed.\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" said the lady, still staring at her, \"you look very well. I\r\nshould scarcely have supposed it.\" Cynthia took the remark in good part,\r\nfor she thought the lady a character, which she was. \"I hope you will\r\nremember that we women were created for a higher purpose than mere\r\nbeauty. The Lord gave us brains, and meant that we should use them. If\r\nyou have a good mind, as I believe you have, learn to employ it for the\r\nbetterment of your sex, for the time of our emancipation is at hand.\"\r\nHaving delivered this little lecture, the lady continued to stare at her\r\nwith keen eyes. \"You look very much like someone I used to love when I\r\nwas younger. What is your name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia Wetherell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia Wetherell? Was your mother Cynthia Ware, from Coniston?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Cynthia, amazed.\r\n\r\nIn an instant the strange lady had risen and had taken Cynthia in her\r\nembrace, new dress and all.\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" she said, \"I thought your face had a familiar look. It was\r\nyour mother I knew and loved. I'm Miss Lucretia Penniman.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia Penniman! Could this be, indeed, the authoress of the \"Hymn\r\nto Coniston,\" of whom Brampton was so proud? The Miss Lucretia Penniman\r\nwho sounded the first clarion note for the independence of American\r\nwomen, the friend of Bryant and Hawthorne and Longfellow? Cynthia had\r\nindeed heard of her. Did not all Brampton point to the house which had\r\nheld the Social Library as to a shrine?\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia,\" said Miss Lucretia, \"I have a meeting now of a girls' charity\r\nto which I must go, but you will come to me at the offices of the Woman's\r\nHour to-morrow morning at ten. I wish to talk to you about your mother\r\nand yourself.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia promised, provided they did not leave for Coniston earlier, and\r\nin that event agreed to write. Whereupon Miss Lucretia kissed her again\r\nand hurried off to her meeting. On the way back to the Tremont House\r\nCynthia related excitedly the whole circumstance to Jethro and Ephraim.\r\nEphraim had heard of Miss Lucretia, of course. Who had not? But he did\r\nnot read the Woman's Hour. Jethro was silent. Perhaps he was thinking of\r\nthat fresh summer morning, so long ago, when a girl in a gig had\r\novertaken him in the canon made by the Brampton road through the woods.\r\nThe girl had worn a poke bonnet, and was returning a book to this same\r\nMiss Lucretia Penniman's Social Library. And the book was the \"Life of\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro, shall we still be in Boston to-morrow morning?\" Cynthia\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nHe roused himself. \"Yes,\" he said, \"yes.\" \"When are you going home?\"\r\n\r\nHe did not answer this simple question, but countered. \"Hain't you\r\nenjoyin' yourself, Cynthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I am,\" she declared. But she thought it strange that he would\r\nnot tell her when they would be in Coniston.\r\n\r\nEphraim did buy a new shirt, and also (in view of the postmastership in\r\nhis packet) a new necktie, his old one being slightly frayed.\r\n\r\nThe grandeur of the approaching supper party and the fear of Mrs. Merrill\r\nhung very heavy over him; nor was Jethro's mind completely at rest.\r\nEphraim even went so far as to discuss the question as to whether Mr.\r\nMerrill had not surpassed his authority in inviting him, and full\r\nexpected to be met at the door by that gentleman uttering profuse\r\napologies, which Ephraim was quite prepared and willing to take in good\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nNothing of the kind happened, however. Mr. Merrill's railroad being a\r\nmodest one, his house was modest likewise. But Ephraim thought it grand\r\nenough, and yet acknowledged a homelike quality in its grandeur. He began\r\nby sitting on the edge of the sofa and staring at the cut-glass\r\nchandelier, but in five minutes he discovered with a shock of surprise\r\nthat he was actually leaning back, describing in detail how his regiment\r\nhad been cheered as they marched through Boston. And incredible as it may\r\nseem, the person whom he was entertaining in this manner was Mrs. Stephen\r\nMerrill herself. Mrs. Merrill was as tall as Mr. Merrill was short. She\r\nwore a black satin dress with a big cameo brooch pinned at her throat,\r\nher hair was gray, and her face almost masculine until it lighted up with\r\na wonderfully sweet smile. That smile made Ephraim and Jethro feel at\r\nhome; and Cynthia, too, who liked Mrs. Merrill the moment she laid eyes\r\non her.\r\n\r\nThen there were the daughters, Jane and Susan, who welcomed her with a\r\nhospitality truly amazing for city people. Jane was big-boned like her\r\nmother, but Susan was short and plump and merry like her father. Susan\r\ntalked and laughed, and Jane sat and listened and smiled, and Cynthia\r\ncould not decide which she liked the best. And presently they all went\r\ninto the dining room to supper, where there was another chandelier over\r\nthe table. There was also real silver, which shone brilliantly on the\r\nwhite cloth--but there was nothing to eat.\r\n\r\n\"Do tell us another story, Mr. Prescott,\" said Susan, who had listened to\r\nhis last one.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the table, however, had for the moment upset Ephraim, \"Get\r\nJethro to tell you how he took dinner with Jedge Binney,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion, under the circumstances, might not have been a happy\r\none, but its lack of appropriateness did not strike Jethro either. He\r\nyielded to the demand.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I supposed I was goin' to set down same as I would at\r\nhome, where we put the vittles on the table. W-wondered what I was goin'\r\nto eat--wahn't nothin' but a piece of bread on the table. S-sat there and\r\nwatched 'em--nobody ate anything. Presently I found out that Binney's\r\nwife ran her house same as they run hotels. Pretty soon a couple of girls\r\ncome in and put down some food and took it away again before you had a\r\nchance. A-after a while we had coffee, and when I set my cup on the\r\ntable, I noticed Mis' Binney looked kind of cross and began whisperin' to\r\nthe girls. One of 'em fetched a small plate and took my cup and set it on\r\nthe plate. That was all right. I used the plate.\r\n\r\n\"Well, along about next summer Binney had to come to Coniston to see me\r\non a little matter and fetched his wife. Listy, my wife, was alive then.\r\nI'd made up my mind that if I could ever get Mis' Binney to eat at my\r\nplace I would, so I asked 'em to stay to dinner. When we set down, I\r\nsaid: 'Now, Mis' Binney, you and the Judge take right hold, and anything\r\nyou can't reach, speak out and we'll wait on you.' And Mis' Binney?'\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said. She was a little mite scared, I guess. B-begun to\r\nsuspect somethin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mis' Binney,\" said I, \"y-you can set your cup and sarcer where you've a\r\nmind to.' O-ought to have heard the Judge laugh. Says he to his wife:\r\n'Fanny, I told you Jethro'd get even with you some time for that sarcer\r\nbusiness.'\"\r\n\r\nThis story, strange as it may seem, had a great success at Mr. Merrill's\r\ntable. Mr. Merrill and his daughter Susan shrieked with laughter when it\r\nwas finished, while Mrs. Merrill and Jane enjoyed themselves quite as\r\nmuch in their quiet way. Even the two neat Irish maids, who were serving\r\nthe supper very much as poor Mis' Binney's had been served, were fain to\r\nleave the dining room abruptly, and one of them disgraced herself at\r\nsight of Jethro when she came in again, and had to go out once mare. Mrs.\r\nMerrill insisted that Jethro should pour out his coffee in what she was\r\npleased to call the old-fashioned way. All of which goes to prove that\r\ntable-silver and cut glass chandeliers do not invariably make their\r\nowners heartless and inhospitable. And Ephraim, whose plan of campaign\r\nhad been to eat nothing to speak of and have a meal when he got back to\r\nthe hotel, found that he wasn't hungry when he arose from the table.\r\n\r\nThere was much bantering of Jethro by Mr. Merrill, which the ladies did\r\nnot understand--talk of a mighty coalition of the big railroads which was\r\nto swallow up the little railroads. Fortunately, said Mr. Merrill,\r\nhumorously, fortunately they did not want his railroad. Or unfortunately,\r\nwhich was it? Jethro didn't know. He never laughed at anybody's jokes.\r\nBut Cynthia, who was listening with one ear while Susan talked into the\r\nother, gathered that Jethro had been struggling with the railroads, and\r\nwas sooner or later to engage in a mightier struggle with them. How, she\r\nasked herself in her innocence, was any one, even Uncle Jethro, to\r\nstruggle with a railroad? Many other people in these latter days have\r\nasked themselves that very question.\r\n\r\nAll together the evening at Mr. Merrill's passed off so quickly and so\r\nhappily that Ephraim was dismayed when he discovered that it was ten\r\no'clock, and he began to make elaborate apologies to the ladies. But\r\nJethro and Mr. Merrill were still closeted together in the dining room:\r\nonce Mrs. Merrill had been called to that conference, and had returned\r\nafter a while to take her place quietly again among the circle of\r\nEphraim's listeners. Now Mr. Merrill came out of the dining room alone.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia,\" he said, and his tone was a little more grave than usual,\r\n\"your Uncle Jethro wants to speak to you.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia rose, with a sense of something in the air which concerned her,\r\nand went into the dining room. Was it the light falling from above that\r\nbrought out the lines of his face so strongly? Cynthia did not know, but\r\nshe crossed the room swiftly and sat down beside him.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Uncle Jethro?\"\r\n\r\n\"C-Cynthy,\" he said, putting his hand over hers on the table, \"I want you\r\nto do something for me er--for me,\" he repeated, emphasizing the last\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\"I'll do anything in the world for you, Uncle Jethro,\" she answered; \"you\r\nknow that. What--what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"L-like Mr. Merrill, don't you?\" \"Yes, indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"L-like Mrs. Merrill--like the gals--don't you?\" \"Very much,\" said\r\nCynthia, perplexedly.\r\n\r\n\"Like 'em enough to--to live with 'em a winter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Live with them a winter!\"\r\n\r\n\"C-Cynthy, I want you should stay in Boston this winter and go to a young\r\nladies' school.\"\r\n\r\nIt was out. He had said it, though he never quite knew where he had found\r\nthe courage.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro!\" she cried. She could only look at him in dismay, but the\r\ntears came into her eyes and sparkled.\r\n\r\n\"You--you'll be happy here, Cynthy. It'll be a change for you. And I\r\nshan't be so lonesome as you'd think. I'll--I'll be busy this winter,\r\nCynthy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know that I wouldn't leave you, Uncle Jethro,\" she said\r\nreproachfully. \"I should be lonesome, if you wouldn't. You would be\r\nlonesome--you know you would be.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll do this for me, Cynthy. S-said you would, didn't you--said you\r\nwould?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you want me to do this?\"\r\n\r\n\"W-want you to go to school for a winter, Cynthy. Shouldn't think I'd\r\ndone right by you if I didn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have been to school. Daddy taught me a lot, and Mr. Satterlee has\r\ntaught me a great deal more. I know as much as most girls of my age, and\r\nI will study so hard in Coniston this winter, if that is what you want.\r\nI've never neglected my lessons, Uncle Jethro.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tain't book-larnin'--'tain't what you'd get in book larnin' in Boston,\r\nCynthy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Jethro, \"they'd teach you to be a lady, Cynthy.\"\r\n\r\n\"A lady!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father come of good people, and--and your mother was a lady. I'm\r\nonly a rough old man, Cynthy, and I don't know much about the ways of\r\nfine folks. But you've got it in ye, and I want you should be equal to\r\nthe best of 'em: You can. And I shouldn't die content unless I'd felt\r\nthat you'd had the chance. Er--Cynthy--will you do it for me?\"\r\n\r\nShe was silent a long while before she turned to him, and then the tears\r\nwere running very swiftly down her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I will do it for you,\" she answered. \"Uncle Jethro, I believe you\r\nare the best man, in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"D-don't say that, Cynthy--d-don't say that,\" he exclaimed, and a sharp\r\nagony was in his voice. He got to his feet and went to the folding doors\r\nand opened them. \"Steve!\" he called, \"Steve!\"\r\n\r\n\"S-says she'll stay, Steve.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill had come in, followed by his wife. Cynthia saw them but dimly\r\nthrough her tears. And while she tried to wipe the tears away she felt\r\nMrs. Merrill's arm about her, and heard that lady say:--\"We'll try to\r\nmake you very happy, my dear, and send you back safely in the spring.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nAn attempt will be made in these pages to set down such incidents which\r\nalone may be vital to this chronicle, now so swiftly running on. The\r\nreasons why Mr. Merrill was willing to take Cynthia into his house must\r\ncertainly be clear to the reader. In the first place, he was under very\r\nheavy obligations to Jethro Bass for many favors; in the second place,\r\nMr. Merrill had a real affection for Jethro, which, strange as it may\r\nseem to some, was quite possible; and in the third place, Mr. Merrill had\r\ntaken a fancy to Cynthia, and he had never forgotten the unintentional\r\nwrong he had done William Wetherell. Mr. Merrill was a man of impulses,\r\nand generally of good impulses. Had he not himself urged upon Jethro the\r\narrangement, it would never have come about. Lastly, he had invited\r\nCynthia to his house that his wife might inspect her, and Mrs. Merrill's\r\nverdict had been instant and favorable--a verdict not given in words. A\r\nsingle glance was sufficient, for these good people so understood each\r\nother that Mrs. Merrill had only to raise her eyes to her husband's, and\r\nthis she did shortly after the supper party began; while she was pouring\r\nthe coffee, to be exact. Thus the compact that Cynthia was to spend the\r\nwinter in their house was ratified.\r\n\r\nThere was, first of all, the parting with Jethro and the messages with\r\nwhich he and Ephraim were laden for the whole village and town of\r\nConiston. It was very hard, that parting, and need not be dwelt upon.\r\nEphraim waved his blue handkerchief as the train pulled out, but Jethro\r\nstood on the platform, silent and motionless: more eloquent in his\r\nsorrow--so Mr. Merrill thought--than any human being he had ever known.\r\nMr. Merrill wondered if Jethro's sorrow were caused by this parting\r\nalone; he believed it was not, and suddenly guessed at the true note of\r\nit. Having come by chance upon the answer to the riddle, Mr. Merrill\r\nstood still with his hand on the carriage door and marvelled that he had\r\nnot seen it all sooner. He was a man to take to heart the troubles of his\r\nfriends. A subtle change had indeed come over Jethro, and he was not the\r\nsame man Mr. Merrill had known for many years. Would others, the men with\r\nwhom Jethro contended and the men he commanded, mark this change? And\r\nwhat effect would it have on the conflict for the mastery of a state\r\nwhich was to be waged from now on?\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" said his daughter Susan, \"if you don't get in and close the\r\ndoor, we'll drive off and leave you standing on the sidewalk.\"\r\n\r\nThus Cynthia went to her new friends in their own carriage. Mrs. Merrill\r\nwas goodness itself, and loved the girl for what she was. How, indeed,\r\nwas she to help loving her? Cynthia was scrupulous in her efforts to give\r\nno trouble, and yet she never had the air of a dependent or a\r\nbeneficiary; but held her head high, and when called upon gave an opinion\r\nas though she had a right to it. The very first morning Susan, who was\r\nprone to be late to breakfast, came down in a great state of excitement\r\nand laughter.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think Cynthia's done, Mother?\" she cried. \"I went into her\r\nroom a while ago, and it was all swept and aired, and she was making up\r\nthe bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's an excellent plan,\" said Mrs. Merrill, \"tomorrow morning you\r\nthree girls will have a race to see who makes up her room first.\"\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that the race at bed-making never came off, Susan\r\nand Jane having pushed Cynthia into a corner as soon as breakfast was\r\nover, and made certain forcible representations which she felt bound to\r\nrespect, and a treaty was drawn up and faithfully carried out, between\r\nthe three, that she was to do her own room if necessary to her happiness.\r\nThe chief gainer by the arrangement was the chambermaid.\r\n\r\nOdd as it may seem, the Misses Merrill lived amicably enough with\r\nCynthia. It is a difficult matter to force an account of the relationship\r\nof five people living in one house into a few pages, but the fact that\r\nthe Merrills had large hearts makes this simpler. There are few families\r\nwho can accept with ease the introduction of a stranger into their midst,\r\neven for a time, and there are fewer strangers who can with impunity be\r\nintroduced. The sisters quarrelled among themselves as all sisters will,\r\nand sometimes quarrelled with Cynthia. But oftener they made her the\r\narbiter of their disputes, and asked her advice on certain matters.\r\nEspecially was this true of Susan, whom certain young gentlemen from\r\nHarvard College called upon more or less frequently, and Cynthia had all\r\nof Susan's love affairs--including the current one--by heart in a very\r\nshort time.\r\n\r\nAs for Cynthia, there were many subjects on which she had to take the\r\nadvice of the sisters. They did not criticise the joint creations of\r\nherself and Miss Sukey Kittredge as frankly as Janet Duncan had done; but\r\nJethro had left in Mrs. Merrill's hands a certain sufficient sum for new\r\ndresses for Cynthia, and in due time the dresses were got and worn. To do\r\nthem justice, the sisters were really sincere in their rejoicings over\r\nthe very wonderful transformation which they had been chiefly\r\ninstrumental in effecting.\r\n\r\nIt is not a difficult task to praise a heroine, and one that should be\r\nindulged in but charily. But let some little indulgence be accorded this\r\nparticular heroine by reason of the life she had led, and the situation\r\nin which she now found herself: a poor Coniston girl, dependent on one\r\nwho was not her father, though she loved him as a father; beholden to\r\nthese good people who dwelt in a world into which she had no reasonable\r\nexpectations of entering, and which, to tell the truth, she now feared.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that Cynthia should be brought into contact with many\r\nfriends and relations of the family. Some of these noticed and admired\r\nher; others did neither; others gossiped about Mrs. Merrill behind her\r\nback at her own dinners and sewing circles and wondered what folly could\r\nhave induced her to bring the girl into her house. But Mrs. Merrill, like\r\nmany generous people who do not stop to calculate a kindness, was always\r\nseverely criticised.\r\n\r\nAnd then there were Jane's and Susan's friends, in and out of Miss\r\nSadler's school. For Mrs. Merrill's influence had been sufficient to\r\ninduce Miss Sadler to take Cynthia as a day scholar with her own\r\ndaughters. This, be it known, was a great concession on the part of Miss\r\nSadler, who regarded Cynthia's credentials as dubious enough; and her\r\nyoung ladies were inclined to regard them so, likewise. Some of these\r\nyoung ladies came from other cities,--New York and Philadelphia and\r\nelsewhere,--and their fathers and mothers were usually people to be\r\nmentioned as a matter of course--were, indeed, frequently so mentioned by\r\nMiss Sadler, especially when a visitor called at the school.\r\n\r\n\"Isabel, I saw that your mother sailed for Europe yesterday,\" or, \"Sally,\r\nyour father tells me he is building a gallery for his collection.\" Then\r\nto the visitor, \"You know the Broke house in Washington Square, of\r\ncourse.\"\r\n\r\nOf course the visitor did. But Sally or Isabel would often imitate Miss\r\nSadler behind her back, showing how well they understood her\r\nsnobbishness.\r\n\r\nMiss Sadler was by no means the type which we have come to recognize in\r\nthe cartoons as the Boston school ma'am. She was a little, round person\r\nwith thin lips and a sharp nose all out of character with her roundness,\r\nand bright eyes like a bird's. To do her justice, so far as instruction\r\nwent, her scholars were equally well cared for, whether they hailed from\r\nWashington Square or Washington Court House. There were, indeed, none\r\nfrom such rural sorts of places--except Cynthia. But Miss Sadler did not\r\ntake her hand on the opening day--or afterward--and ask her about Uncle\r\nJethro. Oh, no. Miss Sadler had no interest for great men who did not\r\nsail for Europe or add picture galleries on to their houses. Cynthia\r\nlaughed, a little bitterly, perhaps, at the thought of a picture gallery\r\nbeing added to the tannery house. And she told herself stoutly that Uncle\r\nJethro was a greater man than any of the others, even if Miss Sadler did\r\nnot see fit to mention him. So she had her first taste of a kind of\r\nwormwood that is very common in the world though it did not grow in\r\nConiston.\r\n\r\nFor a while after Cynthia's introduction to the school she was calmly\r\nignored by many of the young ladies there, and once openly--snubbed, to\r\nuse the word in its most disagreeable sense. Not that she gave any of\r\nthem any real cause to snub her. She did not intrude her own affairs upon\r\nthem, but she was used to conversing kindly with the people about her as\r\nequals, and for this offence; on the third day, Miss Sally Broke snubbed\r\nher. It is hard not to make a heroine of Cynthia, not to be able to\r\nrelate that she instantly put Miss Sally's nose out of joint. Susan\r\nMerrill tried to do that, and failed signally, for Miss Sally's nose was\r\nnot easily dislodged. Susan fought more than one of Cynthia's battles. As\r\na matter of fact, Cynthia did not know that she had been affronted until\r\nthat evening. She did not tell her friends how she spent the night\r\nyearning fiercely for Coniston and Uncle Jethro, at times weeping for\r\nthem, if the truth be told; how she had risen before the dawn to write a\r\nletter, and to lay some things in the rawhide trunk. The letter was never\r\nsent, and the packing never finished. Uncle Jethro wished her to stay and\r\nto learn to be a lady, and stay she would, in spite of Miss Broke and the\r\nrest of them. She went to school the next day, and for many days and\r\nweeks thereafter, and held communion with the few alone who chose to\r\ntreat her pleasantly. Unquestionably this is making a heroine of Cynthia.\r\n\r\nIf young men are cruel in their schools, what shall be written of young\r\nwomen? It would be better to say that both are thoughtless. Miss Sally\r\nBroke, strange as it may seem, had a heart, and many of the other young\r\nladies whose fathers sailed for Europe and owned picture galleries; but\r\nthese young ladies were absorbed, especially after vacation, in affairs\r\nof which a girl from Coniston had no part. Their friends were not her\r\nfriends, their amusements not her amusements, and their talk not her\r\ntalk. But Cynthia watched them, as was her duty, and gradually absorbed\r\nmany things which are useful if not essential--outward observances of\r\nwhich the world takes cognizance, and which she had been sent there by\r\nUncle Jethro to learn. Young people of Cynthia's type and nationality are\r\nthe most adaptable in the world.\r\n\r\nBefore the December snows set in Cynthia had made one firm friend, at\r\nleast, in Boston; outside of the Merrill family. That friend was Miss\r\nLucretia Penniman, editress of the Woman's Hour. Miss Lucretia lived in\r\nthe queerest and quaintest of the little houses tucked away under the\r\nhill, with the back door a story higher than the fronts an arrangement\r\nwhich in summer enabled the mistress to walk out of her sitting-room\r\nwindows into a little walled garden. In winter that sitting room was the\r\nsunniest, cosiest room in the city, and Cynthia spent many hours there,\r\nreading or listening to the wisdom that fell from the lips of Miss\r\nLucretia or her guests. The sitting room had uneven, yellow-white\r\npanelling that fairly shone with enamel, mahogany bookcases filled with\r\nauthors who had chosen to comply with Miss Lucretia's somewhat rigorous\r\ncensorship; there was a table laden with such magazines as had to do with\r\nthe uplifting of a sex, a delightful wavy floor covered with a rose\r\ncarpet; and, needless to add, not a pin or a pair of scissors out of\r\nplace in the whole apartment.\r\n\r\nThere is no intention of enriching these pages with Miss Lucretia's\r\nhomilies. Their subject-matter may be found in the files of the Woman's\r\nHour. She did not always preach, although many people will not believe\r\nthis statement. Miss Lucretia, too, had a heart, though she kept it\r\nhidden away, only to be brought out on occasions when she was sure of its\r\nappreciation, and she grew strangely interested in this self-contained\r\ngirl from Coniston whose mother she had known. Miss Lucretia understood\r\nCynthia, who also was the kind who kept her heart hidden, the kind who\r\nconceal their troubles and sufferings because they find it difficult to\r\ngive them out. So Miss Lucretia had Cynthia to take supper with her at\r\nleast once in the week, and watched her quietly, and let her speak of as\r\nmuch of her life as she chose--which was not much, at first. But Miss\r\nLucretia was content to wait, and guessed at many things which Cynthia\r\ndid not tell her, and made some personal effort, unknown to Cynthia, to\r\nfind out other things. It will be said that she had designs on the girl.\r\nIf so, they were generous designs; and perhaps it was inevitable that\r\nMiss Lucretia should recognize in every young woman of spirit and brains\r\na possible recruit for the cause.\r\n\r\nIt has now been shown in some manner and as briefly as possible how\r\nCynthia's life had changed, and what it had become. We have got her\r\npartly through the winter, and find her still dreaming of the sparkling\r\nsnow on Coniston and of the wind whirling it on clear, cold days like\r\nsmoke among the spruces; of Uncle Jethro sitting by his stove through the\r\nlong evenings all alone; of Rias in his store and Moses Hatch and Lem\r\nHallowell, and Cousin Ephraim in his new post-office. Uncle Jethro wrote\r\nfor the first time in his life--letters: short letters, but in his own\r\nhandwriting, and deserving of being read for curiosity's sake if there\r\nwere time. The wording was queer enough and guarded enough, but they were\r\ncharged with a great affection which clung to them like lavender.\r\n\r\nAnd Cynthia kept them every one, and read them over on such occasions\r\nwhen she felt that she could not live another minute out of sight of her\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of affairs one gray afternoon in December when\r\nCynthia, who was sitting in Mrs. Merrill's parlor, suddenly looked up\r\nfrom her book to discover that two young men were in the room. The young\r\nmen were apparently quite as much surprised as she, and the parlor maid\r\nstood grinning behind them.\r\n\r\n\"Tell Miss Susan and Miss Jane, Ellen,\" said Cynthia, preparing to\r\ndepart. One of the young men she recognized from a photograph on Susan's\r\nbureau. He was, for the time being, Susan's. His name, although it does\r\nnot matter much, was Morton Browne, and he would have been considerably\r\nastonished if he had guessed how much of his history Cynthia knew. It was\r\nMr. Browne's habit to take Susan for a walk as often as propriety\r\npermitted, and on such occasions he generally brought along a\r\ngood-natured classmate to take care of Jane. This, apparently, was one of\r\nthe occasions. Mr. Browne was tall and dark and generally good-looking,\r\nwhile his friends were usually distinguished for their good nature.\r\n\r\nMr. Browne stood between her and the door and looked at her rather\r\nfixedly. Then he said:--\"Excuse me.\"\r\n\r\nA great many friendships, and even love affairs, have been inaugurated by\r\njust such an opening.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Cynthia, and tried to pass out. But Mr. Browne had no\r\nintention of allowing her to do so if he could help it.\r\n\r\n\"I hope I am not intruding,\" he said politely.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" answered Cynthia, wondering how she could get by him.\r\n\r\n\"Were you waiting for Miss Merrill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" said Cynthia again.\r\n\r\nThe other young man turned his back and became absorbed in the picture of\r\na lion getting ready to tear a lady to pieces. But Mr. Browne was of that\r\nmettle which is not easily baffled in such matters. He introduced\r\nhimself, and desired to know whom he had the honor of addressing. Cynthia\r\ncould not but enlighten him. Mr. Browne was greatly astonished, and\r\nshowed it.\r\n\r\n\"So you are the mysterious young lady who has been staying here in the\r\nhouse this winter,\" he exclaimed, as though it were a marvellous thing.\r\n\"I have heard Miss Merrill speak of you. She admires you very much. Is it\r\ntrue that you come from--Coniston?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Let me see--where is Coniston?\" inquired Mr. Browne.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know where Brampton is?\" asked Cynthia. \"Coniston is near\r\nBrampton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brampton!\" exclaimed Mr. Browne, \"I have a classmate who comes from\r\nBrampton--Bob Worthington--You must know Bob, then.\"\r\n\r\nYes, Cynthia knew Mr. Worthington.\r\n\r\n\"His father's got a mint of money, they say. I've been told that old\r\nWorthington was the whole show up in those parts. Is that true?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\nNot quite! Mr. Morton Browne eyed her in surprise, and from that moment\r\nshe began to have decided possibilities. Just then Jane and Susan entered\r\narrayed for the walk, but Mr. Browne showed himself in no hurry to\r\ndepart: began to speak, indeed, in a deprecating way about the weather,\r\nappealed to his friend, Mr. King, if it didn't look remarkably like rain,\r\nor hail, or snow. Susan sat down, Jane sat down, Mr. Browne and his\r\nfriend prepared to sit down when Cynthia moved toward the door.\r\n\r\n\"You're not going, Cynthia!\" cried Susan, in a voice that may have had a\r\nlittle too much eagerness in it. \"You must stay and help us entertain Mr.\r\nBrowne.\" (Mr. King, apparently, was not to be entertained.) \"We've tried\r\nso hard to make her come down when people called, Mr. Browne, but she\r\nnever would.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia was not skilled in the art of making excuses. She hesitated for\r\none, and was lost. So she sat down, as far from Mr. Browne as possible,\r\nnext to Jane. In a few minutes Mr. Browne was seated beside her, and how\r\nhe accomplished this manoeuvre Cynthia could not have said, so skilfully\r\nand gradually was it done. For lack of a better subject he chose Mr.\r\nRobert Worthington. Related, for Cynthia's delectation, several of Bob's\r\nescapades in his freshman year: silly escapades enough, but very bold and\r\ndaring and original they sounded to Cynthia, who listened (if Mr. Browne\r\ncould have known it) with almost breathless interest, and forgot all\r\nabout poor Susan talking to Mr. King. Did Mr. Worthington still while\r\naway his evenings stealing barber poles and being chased around Cambridge\r\nby irate policemen? Mr. Browne laughed at the notion. O dear, no! seniors\r\nnever descended to that. Had not Miss Wetherell heard the song wherein\r\nseniors were designated as grave and reverend? Yes, Miss Wetherell had\r\nheard the song. She did not say where, or how. Mr. Worthington, said his\r\nclassmate, had become very serious-minded this year. Was captain of the\r\nbase-ball team and already looking toward the study of law.\r\n\r\n\"Study law!\" exclaimed Cynthia, \"I thought he would go into his father's\r\nmills.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know Bob very well?\" asked Mr. Browne.\r\n\r\nShe admitted that she did not.\r\n\r\n\"He's been away from Brampton a good deal, of course,\" said Mr. Browne,\r\nwho seemed pleased by her admission. To do him justice, he would not\r\nundermine a classmate, although he had other rules of conduct which might\r\neventually require a little straightening out. \"Worthy's a first-rate\r\nfellow, a little quick-tempered, perhaps, and inclined to go his own way.\r\nHe's got a good mind, and he's taken to using it lately. He has come\r\npretty near being suspended once or twice.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia wanted to ask what \"suspended\" was. It sounded rather painful.\r\nBut at this instant there was the rattle of a latch key at the door, and\r\nMr. Merrill walked in.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" he said, spying Cynthia, \"so you have got Cynthia to come\r\ndown and entertain the young men at last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Susan, \"we have got Cynthia to come down at last.\"\r\n\r\nSusan did not go to Cynthia's room that night to chat, as usual, and Mr.\r\nMorton Browne's photograph was mysteriously removed from the prominent\r\nposition it had occupied. If Susan had carried out a plan which she\r\nconceived in a moment of folly of placing that photograph on Cynthia's\r\nbureau, there would undoubtedly have been a quarrel. Cynthia's own\r\nfeelings--seeing that Mr. Browne had not dazzled her--were not--enviable.\r\n\r\nBut she held her peace, which indeed was all she could do, and the next\r\ntime Mr. Browne called, though he took care to mention her name\r\nparticularly at the door, she would not go down to entertain him: though\r\nSusan implored and Jane appealed, she would not go down. Mr. Browne\r\ncalled several times again, with the same result. Cynthia was\r\ninexorable--she would have none of him. Then Susan forgave her. There was\r\nno quarrel, indeed, but there was a reconciliation, which is the best\r\npart of a quarrel. There were tears, of Susan's shedding; there was a\r\ncharacter-sketch of Mr. Browne, of Susan's drawing, and that gentleman\r\nflitted lightly out of Susan's life.\r\n\r\nSome ten days subsequent to this reconciliation Ellen, the parlor maid,\r\nbrought up a card to Cynthia's room. The card bore the name of Mr. Robert\r\nWorthington. Cynthia stared at it, and bent it in her fingers, while\r\nEllen explained how the gentleman had begged that she might see him. To\r\ntell the truth, Cynthia had wondered more than once why he had not come\r\nbefore, and smiled when she thought of all the assurances of undying\r\ndevotion she had heard in Washington. After all, she reflected, why\r\nshould she not see him--once? He might give her news of Brampton and\r\nConiston. Thus willingly deceiving herself, she told Ellen that she would\r\ngo down: much to the girl's delight, for Cynthia was a favorite in the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nAs she entered the parlor Mr. Worthington was standing in the window.\r\nWhen he turned and saw her he started to come forward in his old\r\nimpetuous way, and stopped and looked at her in surprise. She herself did\r\nnot grasp the reason for this.\r\n\r\n\"Can it be possible,\" he said, \"can it be possible that this is my friend\r\nfrom the country?\" And he took her hand with the greatest formality,\r\npressed it the least little bit, and released it. \"How do you do, Miss\r\nWetherell? Do you remember me?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you do--Bob,\" she answered, laughing in spite of herself at his\r\nbanter. \"You haven't changed, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was Mr. Worthington in Washington,\" said he. \"Now it is 'Bob' and\r\n'Miss Wetherell.' Rank patronage! How did you do it, Cynthia?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are like all men,\" said Cynthia, \"you look at the clothes, and not\r\nthe woman. They are not very fine clothes; but if they were much finer,\r\nthey wouldn't change me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it must be Miss Sadler.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Sadler would willingly change me--if she could,\" said Cynthia, a\r\nlittle bitterly. \"How did you find out I was at Miss Sadler's?\"\r\n\r\n\"Morton Browne told me yesterday,\" said Bob. \"I felt like punching his\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he tell you?\" she asked with some concern.\r\n\r\n\"He said that you were here, visiting the Merrills, among other things,\r\nand said that you knew me.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"other things\" Mr. Browne had said were interesting, but flippant. He\r\nhad seen Bob at a college club and declared that he had met a witch of a\r\ncountry girl at the Merrills. He couldn't make her out, because she had\r\nrefused to see him every time he called again. He had also repeated\r\nCynthia's remark about Bob's father not being quite the biggest man in\r\nhis part of the country, and ventured the surmise that she was the\r\ndaughter of a rival mill owner.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you let me know you were in Boston?\" said Bob, reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\"Why should I?\" asked Cynthia, and she could not resist adding, \"Didn't\r\nyou find it out when you went to Brampton--to see me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, getting fiery red, \"the fact is--I didn't go to\r\nBrampton.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you were sensible enough to take my advice, though I suppose\r\nthat didn't make any difference. But--from the way you spoke, I should\r\nhave thought nothing could have kept you away.\"\r\n\r\n\"To tell you the truth,\" said Bob, \"I'd promised to visit a fellow named\r\nBroke in my class, who lives in New York. And I couldn't get out of it.\r\nHis sister, by the way, is in Miss Sadler's. I suppose you know her. But\r\nif I'd thought you'd see me, I should have gone to Brampton, anyway. You\r\nwere so down on me in Washington.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was very good of you to take the trouble to come to see me here.\r\nThere must be a great many girls in Boston you have to visit.\"\r\n\r\nHe caught the little note of coolness in her voice. Cynthia was asking\r\nherself whether, if Mr. Browne had not seen fit to give a good report of\r\nher, he would have come at all. He would have come, certainly. It is to\r\nbe hoped that Bob Worthington's attitude up to this time toward Cynthia\r\nhas been sufficiently defined by his conversation and actions. There had\r\nbeen nothing serious about it. But there can be no question that Mr.\r\nBrowne's openly expressed admiration had enhanced her value in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"There's no girl in Boston that I care a rap for,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I'm relieved to hear it,\" said Cynthia, with feeling.\r\n\r\n\"Are you really?\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you expect me to be, when you said it?\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n\"You've learned more than one thing since you've been in the city,\" he\r\nremarked, \"I suppose there are a good many fellows who come here all the\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there are,\" she said demurely.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he remarked, \"you've changed a lot in three months. I always\r\nthought that, if you had a chance, there'd be no telling where you'd end\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't sound very complimentary,\" said Cynthia. She had, indeed,\r\nchanged. \"In what terrible place do you think I'll end up?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you'll marry one of these Boston men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she laughed, \"that wouldn't be so terrible, would it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe you're engaged to one of 'em now,\" he remarked, looking very\r\nhard at her.\r\n\r\n\"If you believed that, I don't think you would say it,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"I can't make you out. You used to be so frank with me, and now you're\r\nnot at all so. Are you going to Coniston for the holidays?\"\r\n\r\nHer face fell at the question.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Bob,\" she cried, surprising him utterly by a glimpse of the real\r\nCynthia, \"I wish I were--I wish I were! But I don't dare to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't dare to?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I went, I should' never come back--never. I should stay with Uncle\r\nJethro. He's so lonesome up there, and I'm so lonesome down here, without\r\nhim. And I promised him faithfully I'd stay a whole winter at school in\r\nBoston.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia,\" said Bob, in a strange voice as he leaned toward her, \"do\r\nyou--do you care for him as much as all that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Care for him?\" she repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Care for--for Uncle Jethro?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I care for him,\" she cried, her eyes flashing at the thought.\r\n\"I love him better than anybody in the world. Certainly no one ever had\r\nbetter reason to care for a person. My father failed when he came to\r\nConiston--he was not meant for business, and Uncle Jethro took care of\r\nhim all his life, and paid his debts. And he has taken care of me and\r\ngiven me everything that a girl could wish. Very few people know what a\r\nfine character Uncle Jethro has,\" continued Cynthia, carried away as she\r\nwas by the pent-up flood of feeling within her. \"I know what he has done\r\nfor others, and I should love him for that even if he never had done\r\nanything for me.\"\r\n\r\nBob was silent. He was, in the first place, utterly amazed at this\r\noutburst, revealing as it did a depth of passionate feeling in the girl\r\nwhich he had never suspected, and which thrilled him. It was unlike her,\r\nfor she was usually so self-repressed; and, being unlike her, accentuated\r\nboth sides of her character the more.\r\n\r\nBut what was he to say of the defence of Jethro Bass? Bob was not a young\r\nman who had pondered much over the problems of life, because these\r\nproblems had hitherto never touched him. But now he began to perceive,\r\ndimly, things that might become the elements of a tragedy, even as Mr.\r\nMerrill had perceived them some months before. Could a union endure\r\nbetween so delicate a creature as the girl before him and Jethro Bass?\r\nCould Cynthia ever go back to him again, and live with him happily,\r\nwithout seeing many things which before were hidden by reason of her\r\nyouth and innocence?\r\n\r\nBob had not been nearly four years at college without learning something\r\nof the world; and it had not needed the lecture from his father, which he\r\ngot upon leaving Washington, to inform him of Jethro's political\r\npractices. He had argued soundly with his father on that occasion, having\r\nthe courage to ask Mr. Worthington in effect whether he did not sanction\r\nhis underlings to use the same tools as Jethro used. Mr. Worthington was\r\nrighteously angry, and declared that Jethro had inaugurated those\r\npractices in the state, and had to be fought with his own weapons. But\r\nMr. Worthington had had the sense at that time not to mention Cynthia's\r\nname. He hoped and believed that that affair was not serious, and merely\r\na boyish fancy--as indeed it was.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be said, however, that the lecture had not been without its\r\neffect upon Bob. Jethro Bass, after all, was--Jethro Bass. All his life\r\nBob had heard him familiarly and jokingly spoken of as the boss of the\r\nstate, and had listened to the tales, current in all the country towns,\r\nof how Jethro had outwitted this man or that. Some of them were not\r\nrefined tales. Jethro Bass as the boss of the state--with the tolerance\r\nwith which the public in general regard politics--was one thing. Bob was\r\nwilling to call him \"Uncle Jethro,\" admire his great strength and\r\nshrewdness, and declare that the men he had outwitted had richly deserved\r\nit. But Jethro Bass as the ward of Cynthia Wetherell was quite another\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nIt was not only that Cynthia had suddenly and inevitably become a lady.\r\nThat would not have mattered, for such as she would have borne Coniston\r\nand the life of Coniston cheerfully. But Bob reflected, as he walked back\r\nto his rooms in the dark through the snow-laden streets, that Cynthia,\r\nyoung though she might be, possessed principles from which no love would\r\nsway her a hair's breadth. How, indeed, was she to live with Jethro once\r\nher eyes were opened?\r\n\r\nThe thought made him angry, but returned to him persistently during the\r\ndays that followed,--in the lecture room, in the gymnasium, in his own\r\nstudy, where he spent more time than formerly. By these tokens it will be\r\nperceived that Bob, too, had changed a little. And the sight of Cynthia\r\nin Mrs. Merrill's parlor had set him to thinking in a very different\r\nmanner than the sight of her in Washington had affected him. Bob had\r\nmanaged to shift the subject from Jethro, not without an effort, though\r\nhe had done it in that merry, careless manner which was so characteristic\r\nof him. He had talked of many things,--his college life, his\r\nfriends,--and laughed at her questions about his freshman escapades. But\r\nwhen at length, at twilight, he had risen to go, he had taken both her\r\nhands and looked down into her face with a very different expression than\r\nshe had seen him wear before--a much more serious expression, which\r\npuzzled her. It was not the look of a lover, nor yet that of a man who\r\nimagines himself in love. With either of these her instinct would have\r\ntold her how to deal. It was more the look of a friend, with much of the\r\nmasculine spirit of protection in it.\r\n\r\n\"May I come to see you again?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nGently she released her hands, and she did not answer at once. She went\r\nto the window, and stared across the sloping street at the grilled\r\nrailing before the big house opposite, thinking. Her reason told her that\r\nhe should not come, but her spirit rebelled against that reason. It was a\r\npleasure to see him, so she freely admitted to herself. Why should she\r\nnot have that pleasure? If the truth be told, she had argued it all out\r\nbefore, when she had wondered whether he would come. Mrs. Merrill, she\r\nthought, would not object to his coming. But--there was the question she\r\nhad meant to ask him.\r\n\r\n\"Bob,\" she said, turning to him, \"Bob, would your father want you to\r\ncome?\"\r\n\r\nIt was growing dark, and she could scarcely see his face. He hesitated,\r\nbut he did not attempt to evade the question.\r\n\r\n\"No, he would not,\" he answered. And added, with a good deal of force and\r\ndignity: \"I am of age, and can choose my own friends. I am my own master.\r\nIf he knew you as I knew you, he would look at the matter in a different\r\nlight.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia felt that this was not quite true. She smiled a little sadly.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid you don't know me very well, Bob.\" He was about to protest,\r\nbut she went on, bravely, \"Is it because he has quarrelled with Uncle\r\nJethro?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Bob. She was making it terribly hard for him, sparing indeed\r\nneither herself nor him.\r\n\r\n\"If you come here to see me, it will cause a quarrel between you and your\r\nfather. I--I cannot do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing wrong in my seeing you,\" said Bob, stoutly; \"if he\r\ncares to quarrel with me for that, I cannot help it. If the people I\r\nchoose for my friends are good people, he has no right to an objection,\r\neven though he is my father.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia had never come so near real admiration for him as at that moment.\r\n\r\n\"No, Bob, you must not come,\" she said. \"I will not have you quarrel with\r\nhim on my account.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will quarrel with him on my own account,\" he had answered.\r\n\"Good-by. You may expect me this day week.\"\r\n\r\nHe went into the hall to put on his overcoat. Cynthia stood still on the\r\nspot of the carpet where he had left her. He put his head in at the door.\r\n\r\n\"This day week,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Bob, you must not come,\" she answered. But the street door closed after\r\nhim as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\"You must not come.\" Had Cynthia made the prohibition strong enough?\r\nOught she not to have said, \"If you do come, I will not see you?\" Her\r\nknowledge of the motives of the men and women in the greater world was\r\nlargely confined to that which she had gathered from novels--not trashy\r\nnovels, but those by standard authors of English life. And many another\r\ngirl of nineteen has taken a novel for a guide when she has been suddenly\r\nconfronted with the first great problem outside of her experience.\r\nSomebody has declared that there are only seven plots in the world. There\r\nare many parallels in English literature to Cynthia's position,--so far\r\nas she was able to define that position,--the wealthy young peer, the\r\nparson's or physician's daughter, and the worldly, inexorable parents who\r\nhad other plans.\r\n\r\nCynthia was, of course, foolish. She would not look ahead, yet there was\r\nthe mirage in the sky when she allowed herself to dream. It can\r\ntruthfully be said that she was not in love with Bob Worthington. She\r\nfelt, rather than knew, that if love came to her the feeling she had for\r\nJethro Bass--strong though that was--would be as nothing to it. The girl\r\nfelt the intensity of her nature, and shrank from it when her thoughts\r\nran that way, for it frightened her.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Merrill\" she said, a few days later, when she found herself alone\r\nwith that lady, \"you once told me you would have no objection if a friend\r\ncame to see me here.\"\r\n\r\n\"None whatever, my dear,\" answered Mrs. Merrill. \"I have asked you to\r\nhave your friends here.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Merrill knew that a young man had called on Cynthia. The girls had\r\ndiscussed the event excitedly, had teased Cynthia about it; they had\r\ndiscovered, moreover, that the young man had not been a tiller of the\r\nsoil or a clerk in a country store. Ellen, with the enthusiasm of her\r\nrace, had painted him in glowing colors--but she had neglected to read\r\nthe name on his card.\r\n\r\n\"Bob Worthington came to see me last week, and he wants to come again. He\r\nlives in Brampton,\" Cynthia explained, \"and is at Harvard College.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Merrill was decidedly surprised. She went on with her sewing,\r\nhowever, and did not betray the fact. She knew of Dudley Worthington as\r\none of the richest and most important men in his state; she had heard her\r\nhusband speak of him often; but she had never meddled with politics and\r\nrailroad affairs.\r\n\r\n\"By all means let him come, Cynthia,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Merrill got home that evening she spoke of the matter to him.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia is a strange character,\" she said. \"Sometimes I can't understand\r\nher--she seems so much older than our girls, Stephen. Think of her\r\nkeeping this to herself for four days!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill laughed, but he went off to a little writing room he had and\r\nsat for a long time looking into the glowing coals. Then he laughed\r\nagain. Mr. Merrill was a philosopher. After all, he could not forbid\r\nDudley Worthington's son coming to his house, nor did he wish to.\r\n\r\nThat same evening Cynthia wrote a letter and posted it. She found it a\r\nvery difficult letter to write, and almost as difficult to drop into the\r\nmail-box. She reflected that the holidays were close at hand, and then he\r\nwould go to Brampton and forget, even as he had forgotten before. And she\r\ndetermined when Wednesday afternoon came around that she would take a\r\nlong walk in the direction of Brookline. Cynthia loved these walks, for\r\nshe sadly missed the country air,--and they had kept the color in her\r\ncheeks and the courage in her heart that winter. She had amazed the\r\nMerrill girls by the distances she covered, and on more than one occasion\r\nshe had trudged many miles to a spot from which there was a view of Blue\r\nHills. They reminded her faintly of Coniston.\r\n\r\nWho can speak or write with any certainty of the feminine character, or\r\ndeclare what unexpected twists perversity and curiosity may give to it?\r\nWednesday afternoon came, and Cynthia did not go to Brookline. She put on\r\nher coat, and took it off again. Would he dare to come in the face of the\r\nmandate he had received? If he did come, she wouldn't see him. Ellen had\r\nreceived her orders.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock the doorbell rang, and shortly thereafter Ellen appeared,\r\nsimpering and apologetic enough, with a card. She had taken the trouble\r\nto read it this time. Cynthia was angry, or thought she was, and her\r\ncheeks were very red.\r\n\r\n\"I told you to excuse me, Ellen. Why did you let him in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Cynthia, darlin',\" said Ellen, \"if it was made of flint I was,\r\nwouldn't he bring the tears out of me with his wheedlin' an' coaxin'? An'\r\nhim such a fine young gintleman! And whin he took to commandin' like,\r\nsure I couldn't say no to him at all at all. 'Take the card to her,\r\nEllen,' he says--didn't he know me name!--'an' if she says she won't see\r\nme, thin I won't trouble her more.' Thim were his words, Miss.\"\r\n\r\nThere he was before the fire, his feet slightly apart and his hands in\r\nhis pockets, waiting for her. She got a glimpse of him standing thus, as\r\nshe came down the stairs. It was not the attitude of a culprit. Nor did\r\nhe bear the faintest resemblance to a culprit as he came up to her in the\r\ndoorway. The chief recollection she carried away of that moment was that\r\nhis teeth were very white and even when he smiled. He had the impudence\r\nto smile. He had the impudence to seize one of her hands in his, and to\r\nhold aloft a sheet of paper in the other.\r\n\r\n\"What does this mean?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"What do you thick it means?\" retorted Cynthia, with dignity.\r\n\r\n\"A summons to stay away,\" said Bob, thereby more or less accurately\r\ndescribing it. \"What would you have thought of me if I had not come?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia was not prepared for any such question as this. She had meant to\r\nask the questions herself. But she never lacked for words to protect\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what I think of you for coming, Bob, for insisting upon\r\nseeing me as you did,\" she said, remembering with shame Ellen's account\r\nof that proceeding. \"It was very unkind and very thoughtless of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unkind?\" Thus she succeeded in putting him on the defensive.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, unkind, because I know it is best for you not to come to see me,\r\nand you know it, and yet you will not help me when I try to do what is\r\nright. I shall be blamed for these visits,\" she said. The young ladies in\r\nthe novels always were. But it was a serious matter for poor Cynthia, and\r\nher voice trembled a little. Her troubles seemed very real.\r\n\r\n\"Who will blame you?\" asked Bob, though he knew well enough. Then he\r\nadded, seeing that she did not answer: \"I don't at all agree with you\r\nthat it is best for me not to see you. I know of nobody in the world it\r\ndoes me more good to see than yourself. Let's sit down and talk it all\r\nover,\" he said, for she still remained standing uncompromisingly by the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThe suspicion of a smile came over Cynthia's face. She remembered how\r\nEllen had been wheedled. Her instinct told her that now was the time to\r\nmake a stand or never.\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't do any good, Bob,\" she replied, shaking her head; \"we talked\r\nit all over last week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said he, \"we only touched upon a few points last week. We\r\nought to thrash it out. Various aspects of the matter have occurred to me\r\nwhich I ought to call to your attention.\"\r\n\r\nHe could not avoid this bantering tone, but she saw that he was very much\r\nin earnest too. He realized the necessity of winning; likewise, and he\r\nhad got in and meant to stay.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to argue,\" said Cynthia. \"I've thought it all out.\"\r\n\r\n\"So have I,\" said Bob. \"I haven't thought of anything else, to speak of.\r\nAnd by the way,\" he declared, shaking the envelope, \"I never got a colder\r\nand more formal letter in my life. You must have taken it from one of\r\nMiss Sadler's copy books.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry I haven't been able to equal the warmth of your other\r\ncorrespondents,\" said Cynthia, smiling at the mention of Miss Sadler.\r\n\r\n\"You've got a good many degrees yet to go,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"I have no idea of doing so,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\nIf Cynthia had lured him there, and had carefully thought out a plan of\r\nfanning his admiration into a flame, she could not have done better than\r\nto stand obstinately by the door. Nothing appeals to a man like\r\nresistance--resistance for a principle appealed to Bob, although he did\r\nnot care a fig about that particular principle. In his former dealings\r\nwith young women--and they had not been few--the son of Dudley\r\nWorthington had encountered no resistance worth the mentioning. He looked\r\nat the girl before him, and his blood leaped at the thought of a conquest\r\nover her. She was often demure, but behind that demureness was firmness:\r\nshe was mistress of herself, and yet possessed a marvellous vitality.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Cynthia, \"don't you think you had better go?\"\r\n\r\nGo! He laughed outright. Never! He would sit down under that fortress,\r\nand some day he meant to scale the walls. Like John Paul Jones, he had\r\nnot yet begun to fight. But he did not sit down just yet, because Cynthia\r\nremained standing.\r\n\r\n\"I'm here now,\" he said, \"what's the good of going away? I might as well\r\nstay the rest of the afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will find a photograph album on the table,\" said Cynthia, \"with\r\npictures of all the Merrill family and their friends and relations.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the threat this remark conveyed, he could not help laughing\r\nat it. Mrs. Merrill in her sitting room heard the laugh, and felt that\r\nshe would like Bob Worthington.\r\n\r\n\"It's a heavy album, Cynthia,\" he said; \"perhaps you would hold up one\r\nside of it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Cynthia's turn to laugh. She could not decide whether he were a\r\nman or a boy. Sometimes, she had to admit, he was very much of a man.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"Upstairs, of course,\" she answered.\r\n\r\nThis was really alarming. But fate thrust a final weapon into his hands.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said he, \"I'll look at the album. What time does Mr. Merrill\r\nget home?\"\r\n\r\n\"About six,\" answered Cynthia. \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"When he comes,\" said Bob, \"I shall put on my most disconsolate\r\nexpression. He'll ask me what I'm doing, and I'll tell him you went\r\nupstairs at half-past four and haven't come down. He'll sympathize, I'll\r\nbet anything.\"\r\n\r\nWhether Bob were really capable of doing this, Cynthia could not tell.\r\nShe believed he was. Perhaps she really did not intend to go upstairs\r\njust then. To his intense relief she seated herself on a straight-backed\r\nchair near the door, although she had the air of being about to get up\r\nagain at any minute. It was not a surrender, not at all--but a parley, at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\n\"I really want to talk to you seriously, Bob,\" she said, and her voice\r\nwas serious. \"I like you very much--I always have--and I want you to\r\nlisten seriously. All of us have friends. Some people--you, for\r\ninstance--have a great many. We have but one father.\" Her voice failed a\r\nlittle at the word. \"No friend can ever be the same to you as your\r\nfather, and no friendship can make up what his displeasure will cost you.\r\nI do not mean to say that I shan't always be your friend, for I shall\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\nYoung men seldom arrive at maturity by gradual steps--something sets them\r\nthinking, a week passes, and suddenly the world has a different aspect.\r\nBob had thought much of his father during that week, and had considered\r\ntheir relationship very carefully. He had a few precious memories of his\r\nmother before she had been laid to rest under that hideous and\r\npretentious monument in the Brampton hill cemetery. How unlike her was\r\nthat monument! Even as a young boy, when on occasions he had wandered\r\ninto the cemetery, he used to stand before it with a lump in his throat\r\nand bitter resentment in his heart, and once he had shaken his fist at\r\nit. He had grown up out of sympathy with his father, but he had never\r\nuntil now began to analyze the reasons for it. His father had given him\r\neverything except that communion of which Cynthia spoke so feelingly. Mr.\r\nWorthington had acted according to his lights: of all the people in the\r\nworld he thought first of his son. But his thoughts and care had been\r\nalone of what the son would be to the world: how that son would carry on\r\nthe wealth and greatness of Isaac D. Worthington.\r\n\r\nBob had known this before, but it had had no such significance for him\r\nthen as now. He was by no means lacking in shrewdness, and as he had\r\ngrown older he had perceived clearly enough Mr. Worthington's reasons for\r\nthrowing him socially with the Duncans. Mr. Worthington had never been a\r\nplain-spoken man, but he had as much as told his son that it was decreed\r\nthat he should marry the heiress of the state. There were other plans\r\nconnected with this. Mr. Worthington meant that his son should eventually\r\nown the state itself, for he saw that the man who controlled the highways\r\nof a state could snap his fingers at governor and council and legislature\r\nand judiciary: could, indeed, do more--could own them even more\r\ncompletely than Jethro Bass now owned them, and without effort. The\r\ndividends would do the work: would canvass the counties and persuade this\r\nman and that with sufficient eloquence. By such tokens it will be seen\r\nthat Isaac D. Worthington is destined to become great, though the\r\ngreatness will be akin to that possessed by those gentlemen who in past\r\nages had built castles across the highway between Venice and the North\r\nSea. All this was in store for Bob Worthington, if he could only be\r\nbrought to see it. These things would be given him, if he would but\r\nconfine his worship to the god of wealth.\r\n\r\nWe are running ahead, however, of Bob's reflections in Mr. Merrill's\r\nparlor in Mount Vernon Street, and the ceremony of showing him the cities\r\nof his world from Brampton hill was yet to be gone through. Bob knew his\r\nfather's plans only in a general way, but in the past week he had come to\r\nknow his father with a fair amount of thoroughness. If Isaac D.\r\nWorthington had but chosen a worldly wife, he might have had a more\r\nworldly son. As it was, Bob's thoughts were a little bitter when Cynthia\r\nspoke of his father, and he tried to think instead what his mother would\r\nhave him do. He could not, indeed, speak of Mr. Worthington's\r\nshortcomings as he understood them, but he answered Cynthia vigorously\r\nenough--even if his words were not as serious as she desired.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you I am old enough to judge for myself, Cynthia,\" said he, \"and\r\nI intend to judge for myself. I don't pretend to be a paragon of virtue,\r\nbut I have a kind of a conscience which tells me when I am doing wrong,\r\nif I listen to it. I have not always listened to it. It tells me I'm\r\ndoing right now, and I mean to listen to it.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia could not but think there was very little self-denial attached to\r\nthis. Men are not given largely to self-denial.\r\n\r\n\"It is easy enough to listen to your conscience when you think it impels\r\nyou to do that which you want to do, Bob,\" she answered, laughing at his\r\nargument in spite of herself.\r\n\r\n\"Are you wicked?\" he demanded abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, no, I don't think I am,\" said Cynthia, taken aback. But she\r\ncorrected herself swiftly, perceiving his bent. \"I should be doing wrong\r\nto let you come here.\"\r\n\r\nHe ignored the qualification.\r\n\r\n\"Are you vain and frivolous?\"\r\n\r\nShe remembered that she had looked in the glass before she had come down\r\nto him, and bit her lip.\r\n\r\n\"Are you given over to idle pursuits, to leading young men from their\r\noccupations and duties?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you've come here to recite the Blue Laws,\" said she, laughing again,\r\n\"I have something better to do than to listen to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia,\" he cried, \"I'll tell you what you are. I'll draw your\r\ncharacter for you, and then, if you can give me one good reason why I\r\nshould not associate with you, I'll go away and never come back.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all very well,\" said Cynthia, \"but suppose I don't admit your\r\nqualifications for drawing my character. And I don't admit them, not for\r\na minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will draw it,\" said he, standing up in front of her. \"Oh, confound\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\nThis exclamation, astonishing and out of place as it was, was caused by a\r\nring at the doorbell. The ring was followed by a whispering and giggling\r\nin the hall, and then by the entrance of the Misses Merrill into the\r\nparlor. Curiosity had been too strong for them. Susan was human, and here\r\nwas the opportunity for a little revenge. In justice to her, she meant\r\nthe revenge to be very slight.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Cynthia, you should have come to the concert,\" she said; \"it was\r\nfine, wasn't it, Jane? Is this Mr. Worthington? How do you do. I'm Miss\r\nSusan Merrill, and this is Miss Jane Merrill.\" Susan only intended to\r\nstay a minute, but how was Bob to know that? She was tempted into staying\r\nlonger. Bob lighted the gas, and she inspected him and approved. Her\r\napproval increased when he began to talk to her in his bantering way, as\r\nif he had known her always. Then, when she was fully intending to go, he\r\nrose to take his leave.\r\n\r\n\"I'm awfully glad to have met you at last,\" he said to Susan, \"I've heard\r\nso much about you.\" His leave-taking of Jane was less effusive, and then\r\nhe turned to Cynthia and took her hand. \"I'm going to Brampton on\r\nFriday,\" he said, \"for the holidays. I wish you were going.\"\r\n\r\n\"We couldn't think of letting her go, Mr. Worthington,\" cried Susan, for\r\nthe thought of the hills had made Cynthia incapable of answering. \"We're\r\nonly to have her for one short winter, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Mr. Worthington, gravely. \"I'll see old Ephraim, and\r\ntell him you're well, and what a marvel of learning, you've become.\r\nAnd--and I'll go to Coniston if that will please you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, Bob, you mustn't do anything of the kind,\" answered Cynthia,\r\ntrying to keep back the tears. \"I--I write to Uncle Jethro very often.\r\nGood-by. I hope you will enjoy your holidays.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm coming to see you the minute I get back and tell you all about\r\neverybody,\" said he.\r\n\r\nHow was she to forbid him to come before Susan and Jane! She could only\r\nbe silent.\r\n\r\n\"Do come, Mr. Worthington,\" said Susan, warmly, wondering at Cynthia's\r\ncoldness and, indeed, misinterpreting it. \"I am sure she will be glad to\r\nsee you. And we shall always make you welcome, at any rate.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was out of the door, Susan became very repentant, and\r\nslipped her hand about Cynthia's waist.\r\n\r\n\"We shouldn't have come in at all if we had known he would go so soon,\r\nindeed we shouldn't, Cynthia.\" And seeing that Cynthia was still silent,\r\nshe added: \"I wouldn't do such a mean thing, Cynthia, I really wouldn't.\r\nWon't you believe me and forgive me?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia scarcely heard her at first. She was thinking of Coniston\r\nmountain, and how the sun had just set behind it. The mountain would be\r\nultramarine against the white fields, and the snow on the hill pastures\r\nto the east stained red as with wine. What would she not have given to be\r\ngoing back to-morrow--yes, with Bob. She confessed--though startled by\r\nthe very boldness of the thought--that she would like to be going there\r\nwith Bob. Susan's appeal brought her back to Boston and the gas-lit\r\nparlor.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive you, Susan! There's nothing to forgive. I wanted him to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wanted him to go?\" repeated Susan, amazed. She may be pardoned if\r\nshe did not believe this, but a glance at Cynthia's face scarcely left a\r\nroom for doubt. \"Cynthia Wetherell, you're the strangest girl I've ever\r\nknown in all my life. If I had a--a friend\" (Susan had another word on\r\nher tongue) \"if I had such a friend as Mr. Worthington, I shouldn't be in\r\na hurry to let him leave me. Of course,\" she added, \"I shouldn't let him\r\nknow it.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia's heart was very heavy during the next few days, heavier by far\r\nthan her friends in Mount Vernon Street imagined. They had grown to love\r\nher almost as one of themselves, and because of the sympathy which comes\r\nof such love they guessed that her thoughts would be turning homeward at\r\nChristmastide. At school she had listened, perforce, to the festival\r\nplans of thirty girls of her own age; to accounts of the probable\r\npresents they were to receive, the cost of some of which would support a\r\nfamily in Coniston for several months; to arrangements for visits, during\r\nwhich there were to be theatre-parties and dances and other gaieties.\r\nCynthia could not help wondering, as she listened in silence to this\r\ntalk, whether Uncle Jethro had done wisely in sending her to Miss\r\nSadler's; whether she would not have been far happier if she had never\r\nknown about such things.\r\n\r\nThen came the last day of school, which began with leave-takings and\r\nembraces. There were not many who embraced Cynthia, though, had she known\r\nit, this was largely her own fault. Poor Cynthia! how was she to know it?\r\nMany more of them than she imagined would have liked to embrace her had\r\nthey believed that the embrace would be returned. Secretly they had grown\r\nto admire this strange, dark girl, who was too proud to bend for the good\r\nopinion of any one--even of Miss Sally Broke. Once during the term\r\nCynthia had held some of them--in the hollow of her hand, and had\r\nincurred the severe displeasure of Miss Sadler by refusing to tell what\r\nshe knew of certain mischief-makers.\r\n\r\nNow, Miss Sadler was going about among them in the school parlor saying\r\ngood-by, sending particular remembrance to such of the fathers and\r\nmothers as she thought worthy of that honor; kissing some, shaking, hands\r\nwith all. It was then that a dramatic incident occurred--dramatic for a\r\ngirls' school, at least. Cynthia deliberately turned her back on Miss\r\nSadler and looked out of the window. The chatter in the room was hushed,\r\nand for a moment a dangerous wrath flamed in Miss Sadler's eyes. Then she\r\npassed on with a smile, to send most particular messages to the mother of\r\nMiss Isabel Burrage.\r\n\r\nSome few moments afterward Cynthia felt a touch on her arm, and turned to\r\nfind herself confronted by Miss Sally Broke. Unfortunately there is not\r\nmuch room for Miss Broke in this story, although she may appear in\r\nanother one yet to be written. She was extremely good-looking, with real\r\ngolden hair and mischievous blue eyes. She was, in brief, the leader of\r\nMiss Sadler's school.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia,\" she said, \"I was rude to you when you first came here, and I'm\r\nsorry for it. I want to beg your pardon.\" And she held out her hand.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment's suspense for those watching to see if Cynthia would\r\ntake it. She did take it.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, too,\" said Cynthia, simply, \"I couldn't see what I'd done to\r\noffend you. Perhaps you'll explain now.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Broke blushed violently, and for an instant looked decidedly\r\nuncomfortable. Then she burst into laughter,--merry, irresistible\r\nlaughter that carried all before it.\r\n\r\n\"I was a snob, that's all,\" said she, \"just a plain, low down snob. You\r\ndon't understand what that means, because you're not one.\" (Cynthia did\r\nunderstand, ) \"But I like you, and I want you to be my friend. Perhaps\r\nwhen I get to know you better, you will come home with me sometime for a\r\nvisit.\"\r\n\r\nGo home with her for a visit to that house in Washington Square with the\r\npicture gallery!\r\n\r\n\"I want to say that I'd give my head to have been able to turn my back on\r\nMiss Sadler as you did,\" continued Miss Broke; \"if you ever want a\r\nfriend, remember Sally Broke.\"\r\n\r\nSome of Cynthia's trouble, at least, was mitigated by this episode; and\r\nMiss Broke having led the way, Miss Broke's followers came shyly, one by\r\none, with proffers of friendship. To the good-hearted Merrill girls the\r\nwalk home that day was a kind of a triumphal march, a victory over Miss\r\nSadler and a vindication of their friend. Mrs. Merrill, when she heard of\r\nit, could not find it in her heart to reprove Cynthia. Miss Sadler had\r\ngot her just deserts. But Miss Sadler was not a person who was likely to\r\nforget such an incident. Indeed, Mrs. Merrill half expected to receive a\r\nnote before the holidays ended that Cynthia's presence was no longer\r\ndesired at the school. No such note came, however.\r\n\r\nIf one had to be away from home on Christmas, there could surely be no\r\nbetter place to spend that day than in the Merrill household. Cynthia\r\nremembers still, when that blessed season comes around, how each member\r\nof the family vied with the others to make her happy; how they showered\r\npresents on her, and how they strove to include her in the laughter and\r\njokes at the big family dinner. Mr. Merrill's brother was there with his\r\nwife, and Mrs. Merrill's aunt and her husband, and two broods of cousins.\r\nIt may be well to mention that the Merrill relations, like Sally Broke,\r\nhad overcome their dislike for Cynthia.\r\n\r\nThere were eatables from Coniston on that board. A turkey sent by Jethro\r\nfor which, Mr. Merrill declared, the table would have to be strengthened;\r\na saddle of venison--Lem Hallowell having shot a deer on the mountain two\r\nSundays before; and mince-meat made by Amanda Hatch herself. Other\r\npresents had come to Cynthia from the hills: a gorgeous copy of Mr.\r\nLongfellow's poems from Cousin Ephraim, and a gold locket from Uncle\r\nJethro. This locket was the precise counterpart (had she but known it) of\r\na silver one bought at Mr. Judson's shop many years before, though the\r\ninscription \"Cynthy, from Uncle Jethro,\" was within. Into the other side\r\nexactly fitted that daguerreotype of her mother which her father had\r\ngiven her when he died. The locket had a gold chain with a clasp, and\r\nCynthia wore it hidden beneath her gown-too intimate a possession to be\r\nshown.\r\n\r\nThere was still another and very mysterious present, this being a huge\r\nbox of roses, addressed to Miss Cynthia Wetherell, which was delivered on\r\nChristmas morning. If there had been a card, Susan Merrill would\r\ncertainly have found it. There was no card. There was much pretended\r\nspeculation on the part of the Merrill girls as to the sender, sly\r\nreference to Cynthia's heightened color, and several attempts to pin on\r\nher dress a bunch of the flowers, and Susan declared that one of them\r\nwould look stunning in her hair. They were put on the dining-room table\r\nin the centre of the wreath of holly, and under the mistletoe which hung\r\nfrom the chandelier. Whether Cynthia surreptitiously stole one has never\r\nbeen discovered.\r\n\r\nSo Christmas came and went: not altogether unhappily, deferring for a day\r\nat least the knotty problems of life. Although Cynthia accepted the\r\npresent of the roses with such magnificent unconcern, and would not make\r\nso much as a guess as to who sent them, Mr. Robert Worthington was\r\nfrequently in her thoughts. He had declared his intention of coming to\r\nMount Vernon Street as soon as the holidays ended, and had been cordially\r\ninvited by Susan to do so. Cynthia took the trouble to procure a Harvard\r\ncatalogue from the library, and discovered that he had many holidays yet\r\nto spend. She determined to write another letter, which he would find in\r\nhis rooms when he returned. Just what terrible prohibitory terms she was\r\nto employ in that letter Cynthia could not decide in a moment, nor yet in\r\na day, or a week. She went so far as to make several drafts, some of\r\nwhich she destroyed for the fault of leniency, and others for that of\r\nseverity. What was she to say to him? She had expended her arguments to\r\nno avail. She could wound him, indeed, and at length made up her mind\r\nthat this was the only resource left her, although she would thereby\r\nwound herself more deeply. When she had arrived at this decision, there\r\nremained still more than a week in which to compose the letter.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after New Year's, when the family were assembled around\r\nthe breakfast table, Mrs. Merrill remarked that her husband was\r\nneglecting a custom which had been his for many years.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't the newspaper come, Stephen?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill had read it.\r\n\r\n\"Read it!\" repeated his wife, in surprise, \"you haven't been down long\r\nenough to read a column.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was full of trash,\" said Mr. Merrill, lightly, and began on his usual\r\njokes with the girls. But Mrs. Merrill was troubled. She thought his\r\njokes not as hearty as they were wont to be, and disquieting surmises of\r\nbusiness worries filled her mind. The fact that he beckoned her into his\r\nwriting room as soon as breakfast was over did not tend to allay her\r\nsuspicions. He closed and locked the door after her, and taking the paper\r\nfrom a drawer in his desk bade her read a certain article in it.\r\n\r\nThe article was an arraignment of Jethro Bass--and a terrible arraignment\r\nindeed. Step by step it traced his career from the beginning, showing\r\nfirst of all how he had debauched his own town of Coniston; how,\r\nenlarging on the same methods, he had gradually extended his grip over\r\nthe county and finally over the state; how he had bought and sold men for\r\nhis own power and profit, deceived those who had trusted in him,\r\ncorrupted governors and legislators, congressmen and senators, and even\r\njustices of the courts: how he had trafficked ruthlessly in the\r\nenterprises of the people. Instance upon instance was given, and men of\r\nhigh prominence from whom he had received bribes were named, not the\r\nleast important of these being the Honorable Alva Hopkins of Gosport.\r\n\r\nMrs. Merrill looked up from the paper in dismay.\r\n\r\n\"It's copied from the Newcastle Guardian,\" she said, for lack of\r\nimmediate power to comment. \"Isn't the Guardian the chief paper in that\r\nstate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Worthington's bought it, and he instigated the article, of course.\r\nI've been afraid of this for a long time, Carry,\" said Mr. Merrill,\r\npacing up and down. \"There's a bigger fight than they've ever had coming\r\non up there, and this is the first gun. Worthington, with Duncan behind\r\nhim, is trying to get possession of and consolidate all the railroads in\r\nthe western part of that state. If he succeeds, it will mean the end of\r\nJethro's power. But he won't succeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stephen,\" said his wife, \"do you mean to say that Jethro Bass will try\r\nto defeat this consolidation simply to keep his power?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my dear,\" answered Mr. Merrill, still pacing, \"two wrongs don't\r\nmake a right, I admit. I've known these things a long time, and I've\r\nthought about them a good deal. But I've had to run along with the tide,\r\nor give place to another man who would; and--and starve.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Merrill's eyes slowly filled with tears.\r\n\r\n\"Stephen,\" she began, \"do you mean to say--?\" There she stopped, utterly\r\nunable to speak. He ceased his pacing and sat down beside her and took\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear, I mean to say I've submitted to these things. God knows\r\nwhether I've been right or wrong, but I have. I've often thought I'd be\r\nhappier if I resigned my office as president of my road and became a\r\nclerk in a store. I don't attempt to excuse myself, Carry, but my sin has\r\nbeen in holding on to my post. As long as I remain president I have to\r\ncope with things as I find them.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill spoke thickly, for the sight of his wife's tears wrung his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\"Stephen,\" she said, \"when we were first married and you were a district\r\nsuperintendent, you used to tell me everything.\"\r\n\r\nStephen Merrill was a man, and a good man, as men go. How was he to tell\r\nher the degrees by which he had been led into his present situation? How\r\nwas he to explain that these degrees had been so gradual that his\r\nconscience had had but a passing wrench here and there? Politics being\r\nwhat they were, progress and protection had to be obtained in accordance\r\nwith them, and there was a duty to the holders of bonds and stocks.\r\n\r\nHis wife had a question on her lips, a question for which she had to\r\nsummon all her courage. She chose that form for it which would hurt him\r\nleast.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Worthington is going to try to change these things?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill roused himself at the words, and his eyes flashed. He became\r\na different man.\r\n\r\n\"Change them!\" he cried bitterly, \"change them for the worse, if he can.\r\nHe will try to wrest the power from Jethro Bass. I don't defend him. I\r\ndon't defend myself. But I like Jethro Bass. I won't deny it. He's human,\r\nand I like him, and whatever they say about him I know that he's been a\r\ntrue friend to me. And I tell you as I hope for happiness here and\r\nhereafter, that if Worthington succeeds in what he is trying to do, if\r\nthe railroads win in this fight, there will be no mercy for the people of\r\nthat state. I'm a railroad man myself, though I have no interest in this\r\naffair. My turn may come later. Will come later, I suppose. Isaac D.\r\nWorthington has a very little heart or soul or mercy himself; but the\r\ncorporation which he means to set up will have none at all. It will grind\r\nthe people and debase them and clog their progress a hundred times more\r\nthan Jethro Bass has done. Mark my words, Carry. I'm running ahead of the\r\ntimes a little, but I can see it all as clearly as if it existed now.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Merrill went about her duties that morning with a heavy heart, and\r\nmore than once she paused to wipe away a tear that would have fallen on\r\nthe linen she was sorting. At eleven o'clock the doorbell rang, and Ellen\r\nappeared at the entrance to the linen closet with a card in her hand.\r\nMrs. Merrill looked at it with a, flurry of surprise. It read:--\r\n\r\n           MISS LUCRETIA PENNIMAN\r\n\r\n            The Woman's Hour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nIt was certainly affinity that led Miss Lucretia to choose the rosewood\r\nsofa of a bygone age, which was covered with horsehair. Miss Lucretia's\r\nfeatures seemed to be constructed on a larger and more generous principle\r\nthan those of women are nowadays. Her face was longer. With her curls and\r\nher bonnet and her bombazine,--which she wore in all seasons,--she was in\r\ncomplete harmony with the sofa. She had thrown aside the storm cloak\r\nwhich had become so familiar to pedestrians in certain parts of Boston.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Miss Penniman,\" said Mrs. Merrill, \"I am delighted and honored.\r\nI scarcely hoped for such a pleasure. I have so long admired you and your\r\nwork, and I have heard Cynthia speak of you so kindly.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very good of you to say so, Mrs. Merrill\" answered Miss Lucretia,\r\nin her full, deep voice. It was by no means an unpleasant voice. She\r\nsettled herself, though she sat quite upright, in the geometrical centre\r\nof the horsehair sofa, and cleared her throat. \"To be quite honest with\r\nyou, Mrs. Merrill,\" she continued, \"I came upon particular errand, though\r\nI believe it would not be a perversion of the truth if I were to add that\r\nI have had for a month past every intention of paying you a friendly\r\ncall.\"\r\n\r\nGood Mrs. Merrill's breath was a little taken away by this extremely\r\nscrupulous speech. She also began to feel a misgiving about the cause of\r\nthe visit, but she managed to say something polite in reply.\r\n\r\n\"I have come about Cynthia,\" announced Miss Lucretia, without further\r\npreliminaries.\r\n\r\n\"About Cynthia?\" faltered Mrs. Merrill.\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia opened a reticule at her waist and drew forth a newspaper\r\nclipping, which she unfolded and handed to Mrs. Merrill.\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen this?\" she demanded.\r\n\r\nMrs. Merrill took it, although she guessed very well what it was, glanced\r\nat it with a shudder, and handed it back.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have read it,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I have come to ask you, Mrs. Merrill\" said Miss Lucretia, \"if it is\r\ntrue.\"\r\n\r\nHere was a question, indeed, for the poor lady to answer! But Mrs.\r\nMerrill was no coward.\r\n\r\n\"It is partly true, I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Partly?\" said Miss Lucretia, sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, partly,\" said Mrs. Merrill, rousing herself for the trial; \"I have\r\nnever yet seen a newspaper article which was wholly true.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is because newspapers are not edited by women,\" observed Miss\r\nLucretia. \"What I wish you to tell me, Mrs. Merrill, is this: how much of\r\nthat article is true, and how much of it is false?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, Miss Penniman,\" replied Mrs. Merrill, with spirit, \"I don't see\r\nwhy you should expect me to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"A woman should take an intelligent interest in her husband's affairs,\r\nMrs. Merrill. I have long advocated it as an entering wedge.\"\r\n\r\n\"An entering wedge!\" exclaimed Mrs. Merrill, who had never read a page of\r\nthe Woman's Hour.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Your husband is the president of a railroad, I believe, which is\r\nlargely in that state. I should like to ask him whether these statements\r\nare true in the main. Whether this Jethro Bass is the kind of man they\r\ndeclare him to be.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Merrill was in a worse quandary than ever. Her own spirits were none\r\ntoo good, and Miss Lucretia's eye, in its search for truth, seemed to\r\npierce into her very soul. There was no evading that eye. But Mrs.\r\nMerrill did what few people would have had the courage or good sense to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\"That is a political article, Miss Penniman,\" she said, \"inspired by a\r\nbitter enemy of Jethro Bass, Mr, Worthington, who has bought the\r\nnewspaper from which it was copied. For that reason, I was right in\r\nsaying that it is partly true. You nor I, Miss Penniman, must not be the\r\njudges of any man or woman, for we know nothing of their problems or\r\ntemptations. God will judge them. We can only say that they have acted\r\nrightly or wrongly according to the light that is in us. You will find it\r\ndifficult to get a judgment of Jethro Bass that is not a partisan\r\njudgment, and yet I believe that that article is in the main a history of\r\nthe life of Jethro Bass. A partisan history, but still a history. He has\r\nunquestionably committed many of the acts of which he is accused.\"\r\n\r\nHere was talk to make the author of the \"Hymn to Coniston\" sit up, if she\r\nhadn't been sitting up already.\r\n\r\n\"And don't you condemn him for those acts?\" she gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Mrs. Merrill, thinking of her own husband. Yesterday she would\r\ncertainly have condemned. Jethro Bass. But now! \"I do not condemn\r\nanybody, Miss Penniman.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia thought this extraordinary, to say the least.\r\n\r\n\"I will put the question in another way, Mrs. Merrill,\" said she. \"Do you\r\nthink this Jethro Bass a proper guardian for Cynthia Wetherell?\"\r\n\r\nTo her amazement Mrs. Merrill did not give her an instantaneous answer to\r\nthis question. Mrs. Merrill was thinking of Jethro's love for the girl,\r\nmanifold evidences of which she had seen, and her heart was filled with a\r\nmelting pity. It was such a love, Mrs. Merrill knew, as is not given to\r\nmany here below. And there was Cynthia's love for him. Mrs. Merrill had\r\nsuffered that morning thinking of this tragedy also.\r\n\r\n\"I do not think he is a proper guardian for her, Miss Penniman.\"\r\n\r\nIt was then that the tears came to Mrs. Merrill's eyes for there is a\r\nlimit to all human endurance. The sight of these caused a remarkable\r\nchange in Miss Lucretia, and she leaned forward and seized Mrs. Merrill's\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" she cried, \"my dear, what are we to do? Cynthia can't go back\r\nto that man. She loves him, I know, she loves him as few girls are\r\ncapable of loving. But when she, finds out what he is! When she finds out\r\nhow he got the money to support her father!\" Miss Lucretia fumbled in her\r\nreticule and drew forth a handkerchief and brushed her own eyes--eyes\r\nwhich a moment ago were so piercing. \"I have seen many young women,\" she\r\ncontinued; \"but I have known very few who were made of as fine a fibre\r\nand who have such principles as Cynthia Wetherell.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very true,\" assented Mrs. Merrill too much cast down to be\r\namazed by this revelation of Miss Lucretia's weakness.\r\n\r\n\"But what are we to do?\" insisted that lady; \"who is to tell her what he\r\nis? How is it to be kept from her, indeed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Merrill, \"there will be more, articles. Mr. Merrill says\r\nso. It seems there is to be a great political struggle in that state.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely,\" said Miss Lucretia, sadly. \"And whoever tells the girl will\r\nforfeit her friendship. I--I am very fond of her,\" and here she applied\r\nagain to the reticule.\r\n\r\n\"Whom would she believe?\" asked Mrs. Merrill, whose estimation of Miss\r\nLucretia was increasing by leaps and bounds.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely,\" agreed Miss Lucretia. \"But she must hear about it sometime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't it be better to let her hear?\" suggested Mrs. Merrill; \"we\r\ncannot very well soften that shock: I talked the matter over a little\r\nwith Mr. Merrill, and he thinks that we must take time over it, Miss\r\nPenniman. Whatever we do, we must not act hastily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Miss Lucretia, \"as I said, I am very fond of the girl, and I\r\nam willing to do my duty, whatever it may be. And I also wished to say,\r\nMrs. Merrill, that I have thought about another matter very carefully. I\r\nam willing to provide for the girl. I am getting too old to live alone. I\r\nam getting too old, indeed, to do my work properly, as I used to do it. I\r\nshould like to have her to live with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"She has become as one of my own daughters,\" said Mrs. Merrill. Yet she\r\nknew that this offer of Miss Lucretia's was not one to be lightly set\r\naside, and that it might eventually be the best solution of the problem.\r\nAfter some further earnest discussion it was agreed between them that the\r\nmatter was, if possible, to be kept from Cynthia for the present, and\r\nwhen Miss Lucretia departed Mrs. Merrill promised her an early return of\r\nher call.\r\n\r\nMrs. Merrill had another talk with her husband, which lasted far into the\r\nnight. This talk was about Cynthia alone, and the sorrow which threatened\r\nher. These good people knew that it would be no light thing to break the\r\nfaith of such as she, and they made her troubles their own.\r\n\r\nCynthia little guessed as she exchanged raillery with Mr. Merrill the\r\nnext morning that he had risen fifteen minutes earlier than usual to\r\nsearch his newspaper through. He would read no more at breakfast, so he\r\ndeclared in answer to his daughters' comments; it was a bad habit which\r\ndid not agree with his digestion. It was something new for Mr. Merrill to\r\nhave trouble with his digestion.\r\n\r\nThere was another and scarcely less serious phase of the situation which\r\nMr. and Mrs. Merrill had yet to discuss between them--a phase of which\r\nMiss Lucretia Penniman knew nothing.\r\n\r\nThe day before Miss Sadler's school was to reopen nearly a week before\r\nthe Harvard term was to commence--a raging, wet snowstorm came charging\r\nin from the Atlantic. Snow had no terrors for a Coniston person, and\r\nCynthia had been for her walk. Returning about five o'clock, she was\r\nsurprised to have the door opened for her by Susan herself.\r\n\r\n\"What a picture you are in those furs!\" she cried, with an intention\r\nwhich for the moment was lost upon Cynthia. \"I thought you would never\r\ncome. You must have walked to Dedham this time. Who do you think is here?\r\nMr. Worthington.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Worthington!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been trying to entertain him, but I am afraid I have been a very\r\npoor substitute. However, I have persuaded him to stay for supper.\"\r\n\r\n\"It needed but little persuasion,\" said Bob, appearing in the doorway.\r\nAll the snowstorms of the wide Atlantic could not have brought such color\r\nto her cheeks. Cynthia, for all her confusion at the meeting, had not\r\nlost her faculty of observation. He seemed to have changed again, even\r\nduring the brief time he had been absent. His tone was grave.\r\n\r\n\"He needs to be cheered up, Cynthia,\" Susan went on, as though reading\r\nher thoughts. \"I have done my best, without success. He won't confess to\r\nme that he has come back to make up some of his courses. I don't mind\r\nowning that I've got to finish a theme to be handed in tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words Susan departed, and left them standing in the hall\r\ntogether. Bob took hold of Cynthia's jacket and helped her off with it.\r\nHe could read neither pleasure nor displeasure in her face, though he\r\nsearched it anxiously enough. It was she who led the way into the parlor\r\nand seated herself, as before, on one of the uncompromising,\r\nstraight-backed chairs. Whatever inward tremors the surprise of this\r\nvisit had given her, she looked at him clearly and steadily, completely\r\nmistress of herself, as ever.\r\n\r\n\"I thought your holidays did not end until next week,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"They do not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why are you here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I could not stay away, Cynthia,\" he answered. It was not the\r\nmanner in which he would have said it a month ago. There was a note of\r\nintense earnestness in his voice--now, and to it she could make no light\r\nreply. Confronted again with an unexpected situation, she could not\r\ndecide at once upon a line of action.\r\n\r\n\"When did you leave Brampton?\" she asked, to gain time. But with the\r\nwords her thoughts flew to the hill country.\r\n\r\n\"This morning,\" he said, \"on the early train. They have three feet of\r\nsnow up there.\" He, too, seemed glad of a respite from something.\r\n\"They're having a great fuss in Brampton about a new teacher for the\r\nvillage school. Miss Goddard has got married. Did you know Miss Goddard,\r\nthe lanky one with the glasses?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Cynthia, beginning to be amused at the turn the conversation\r\nwas taking.\r\n\r\n\"Well, they can't find anybody smart enough to replace Miss Goddard. Old\r\nEzra Graves, who's on the prudential committee, told Ephraim they ought\r\nto get you. I was in the post-office when they were talking about it.\r\nJust see what a reputation for learning you have in Brampton!\"\r\n\r\nCynthia was plainly pleased by the compliment.\r\n\r\n\"How is Cousin Eph?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Happy as a lark,\" said Bob, \"the greatest living authority in New\r\nEngland on the Civil War. He's made the post-office the most popular\r\nsocial club I ever saw. If anybody's missing in Brampton, you can nearly\r\nalways find them in the post-office. But I smiled at the notion of your\r\nbeing a school ma'am.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see anything so funny about it,\" replied Cynthia, smiling too.\r\n\"Why shouldn't I be? I should like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were made for something different,\" he answered quietly.\r\n\r\nIt was a subject she did not choose to discuss with him, and dropped her\r\nlashes before the plainly spoken admiration in his eyes. So a silence\r\nfell between them, broken only by the ticking of the agate clock on the\r\nmantel and the music of sleigh-bells in a distant street. Presently the\r\nsleigh-bells died away, and it seemed to Cynthia that the sound of her\r\nown heartbeats must be louder than the ticking of the clock. Her tact had\r\nsuddenly deserted her; without reason, and she did not dare to glance\r\nagain at Bob as he sat under the lamp. That minute--for it was a full\r\nminute--was charged with a presage which she could not grasp. Cynthia's\r\ninstincts were very keen. She understood, of course, that he had cut\r\nshort his holiday to come to see her, and she might have dealt with him\r\nhad that been all. But--through that sixth sense with which some women\r\nare endowed--she knew that something troubled him. He, too, had never yet\r\nbeen at a loss for words.\r\n\r\nThe silence forced him to speak first, and he tried to restore the light\r\ntone to the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Cousin Ephraim gave me a piece of news,\" he said. \"Ezra Graves got it,\r\ntoo. He told us you were down in Boston at a fashionable school. Cousin\r\nEphraim knows a thing or two. He says he always callated you were cut out\r\nfor a fine lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bob,\" said Cynthia, nerving herself for the ordeal, \"did you tell Cousin\r\nEphraim you had seen me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I told him and Ezra that I had been a constant and welcome visitor at\r\nthis house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did, you tell your father that you had seen me?\"\r\n\r\nThis was too serious a question to avoid.\r\n\r\n\"No, I did not. There was no reason why I should have.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was every reason,\" said Cynthia, \"and you know it. Did you tell\r\nhim why you came to Boston to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why does he think you came?\"\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't think anything about it,\" said Bob. \"He went off to Chicago\r\nyesterday to attend a meeting of the board of directors of a western\r\nrailroad.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so,\" she said reproachfully, \"you slipped off as soon as his back\r\nwas turned. I would not have believed that of you, Bob. Do you think that\r\nwas fair to him or me?\"\r\n\r\nBob Worthington sprang to his feet and stood over her. She had spoken to\r\na boy, but she had aroused a man, and she felt an amazing thrill at the\r\nresult. The muscles in his face tightened, and deepened the lines about\r\nhis mouth, and a fire was lighted about his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia,\" he said slowly, \"even you shall not speak to me like that. If\r\nI had believed it were right, if I had believed that it would have done\r\nany good to you or me, I should have told my father the moment I got to\r\nBrampton. In affairs of this kind--in a matter of so much importance in\r\nmy life,\" he continued, choosing his words carefully, \"I am likely to\r\nknow whether I am doing right or wrong. If my mother were alive, I am\r\nsure that she would approve of this--this friendship.\"\r\n\r\nHaving got so far, he paused. Cynthia felt that she was trembling, as\r\nthough the force and feeling that was in him had charged her also.\r\n\r\n\"I did not intend to come so soon,\" he went on, \"but--I had a reason for\r\ncoming. I knew that you did not want me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know that that is not true, Bob,\" she faltered. His next words\r\nbrought her to her feet.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia,\" he said, in a voice shaken by the intensity of his passion, \"I\r\ncame because I love you better than all the world--because I always will\r\nlove you so. I came to protect you, and care for you whatever happens. I\r\ndid not mean to tell you so, now. But it cannot matter, Cynthia!\"\r\n\r\nHe seized her, roughly indeed, in his arms, but his very roughness was a\r\nproof of the intensity of his love. For an instant she lay palpitating\r\nagainst him, and as long as he lives he will remember the first exquisite\r\ntouch of her firm but supple figure and the marvellous communion of her\r\nlips. A current from the great store that was in her, pent up and all\r\nunknown, ran through him, and then she had struggled out of his arms and\r\nfled, leaving him standing alone in the parlor.\r\n\r\nIt is true that such things happen, and no man or woman may foretell the\r\nday or the hour thereof. Cynthia fled up the stairs, miraculously\r\narriving unnoticed at her own room, and locked the door and flung herself\r\non the bed.\r\n\r\nTears came--tears of shame, of joy, of sorrow, of rejoicing, of regret;\r\ntears that burned, and yet relieved her, tears that pained while they\r\ncomforted. Had she sinned beyond the pardon of heaven, or had she\r\ncommitted a supreme act of right? One moment she gloried in it, and the\r\nnext upbraided herself bitterly. Her heart beat with tumult, and again\r\nseemed to stop. Such, though the words but faintly describe them, were\r\nher feelings, for thoughts were still to emerge out of chaos. Love comes\r\nlike a flame to few women, but so it came to Cynthia Wetherell, and\r\nburned out for a while all reason.\r\n\r\nOnly for a while. Generations which had practised self-restraint were\r\nstrong in her--generations accustomed, too, to thinking out, so far as in\r\nthem lay, the logical consequences of their acts; generations ashamed of\r\nthese very instants when nature has chosen to take command. After a time\r\nhad passed, during which the world might have shuffled from its course,\r\nCynthia sat up in the darkness. How was she ever to face the light again?\r\nReason had returned.\r\n\r\nSo she sat for another space, and thought of what she had done--thought\r\nwith a surprising calmness now which astonished her. Then she thought of\r\nwhat she would do, for there was an ordeal still to be gone through.\r\nAlthough she shrank from it, she no longer lacked the courage to endure\r\nit. Certain facts began to stand out clearly from the confusion. The\r\nleast important and most immediate of these was that she would have to\r\nface him, and incidentally face the world in the shape of the Merrill\r\nfamily, at supper. She rose mechanically and lighted the gas and bathed\r\nher face and changed her gown. Then she heard Susan's voice at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia, what in the world are you doing?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia opened the door and the sisters entered. Was it possible that\r\nthey did not read her terrible secret in her face? Apparently not. Susan\r\nwas busy commenting on the qualities and peculiarities of Mr. Robert\r\nWorthington, and showering upon Cynthia a hundred questions which she\r\nanswered she knew not how; but neither Susan nor Jane, wonderful as it\r\nmay seem, betrayed any suspicion. Did he send the flowers? Cynthia had\r\nnot asked him. Did he want to know whether she read the newspapers? He\r\nhad asked Susan that, before Cynthia came. Susan was ready to repeat the\r\nwhole of her conversation with him. Why did he seem so particular about\r\nnewspapers? Had he notions that girls ought not to read them?\r\n\r\nThe significance of Bob's remarks about newspapers was lost upon Cynthia\r\nthen. Not till afterward did she think of them, or connect them with his\r\nunexpected visit. Then the supper bell rang, and they went downstairs.\r\n\r\nThe reader will be spared Mr. Worthington's feelings after Cynthia left\r\nhim, although they were intense enough, and absorbing and far-reaching\r\nenough. He sat down on a chair and buried his head in his hands. His\r\nimpulse had been to leave the house and return again on the morrow, but\r\nhe remembered that he had been asked to stay for supper, and that such a\r\nproceeding would cause comment. At length he got up and stood before the\r\nfire, his thoughts still above the clouds, and it was thus that Mr.\r\nMerrill found him when he entered.\r\n\r\n\"Good evening,\" said that gentleman, genially, not knowing in the least\r\nwho Bob was, but prepossessed in his favor by the way he came forward and\r\nshook his hand and looked him clearly in the eye.\r\n\r\n\"I'm Robert Worthington, Mr. Merrill\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Eh!\" Mr. Merrill gasped, \"eh! Oh, certainly, how do you do, Mr.\r\nWorthington?\" Mr. Merrill would have been polite to a tax collector or a\r\nsheriff. He separated the office from the man, which ought not always to\r\nbe done. \"I'm glad to see you, Mr. Worthington. Well, well, bad storm,\r\nisn't it? I had an idea the college didn't open until next week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Worthington's going to stay for supper, Papa,\" said Susan, entering.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" cried Mr. Merrill. \"Capital! You won't miss the old folks after\r\nsupper, will you, girls? Your mother wants me to go to a whist party.\"\r\n\r\n\"It can't be helped, Carry,\" said Mr. Merrill to his wife, as they walked\r\nup the hill to a neighbor's that evening.\r\n\r\n\"He's in love with Cynthia,\" said Mrs. Merrill, somewhat sadly; \"it's as\r\nplain as the nose on your face, Stephen.\"\r\n\r\n\"That isn't very plain. Suppose he is! You can dam a mountain stream, but\r\nyou can't prevent it reaching the sea, as we used to say when I was a boy\r\nin Edmundton. I like Bob,\" said Mr. Merrill, with his usual weakness for\r\nChristian names, \"and he isn't any more like Dudley Worthington than I\r\nam. If you were to ask me, I'd say he couldn't do a better thing than\r\nmarry Cynthia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stephen!\" exclaimed Mrs. Merrill. But in her heart she thought so, too.\r\n\"What will Mr. Worthington say when he hears the young man has been\r\ncoming to our house to see her?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill had been thinking of that very thing, but with more amusement\r\nthan concern.\r\n\r\nTo return to Mr. Merrill's house, the three girls and the one young man\r\nwere seated around the fire, and their talk, Merrill as it had begun, was\r\nbecoming minute by minute more stilted. This was largely the fault of\r\nSusan, who would not be happy until she had taken Jane upstairs and left\r\nMr. Worthington and Cynthia together. This matter had been arranged\r\nbetween the sisters before supper. Susan found her opening at last, and\r\nupbraided Jane for her unfinished theme; Jane, having learned her lesson\r\nwell, accused Susan. But Cynthia, who saw through the ruse, declared that\r\nboth themes were finished. Susan, naturally indignant at such\r\ningratitude, denied this. The manoeuvre, in short, was executed very\r\nclumsily and very obviously, but executed nevertheless--the sisters\r\nmarching out of the room under a fire of protests. The reader, too, will\r\nno doubt think it a very obvious manoeuvre, but some things are managed\r\nbadly in life as well as in books.\r\n\r\nCynthia and Bob were left alone: left, moreover, in mortal terror of each\r\nother. It is comparatively easy to open the door of a room and rush into\r\na lady's arms if the lady be willing and alone. But to be abandoned, as\r\nSusan had abandoned them, and with such obvious intent, creates quite a\r\ndifferent atmosphere. Bob had dared to hope for such an opportunity: had\r\nmade up his mind during supper, while striving to be agreeable, just what\r\nhe would do if the opportunity came. Instead, all he could do was to sit\r\nfoolishly in his chair and look at the coals, not so much as venturing to\r\nturn his head until the sound of footsteps had died away on the upper\r\nfloors. It was Cynthia who broke the silence and took command--a very\r\ndifferent Cynthia from the girl who had thrown herself on the bed not\r\nthree hours before. She did not look at him, but stared with\r\ndetermination into the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Bob, you must go,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Go!\" he cried. Her voice loosed the fetters of his passion, and he dared\r\nto seize the band that lay on the arm of her chair. She did not resist\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you must go. You should not have stayed for supper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia,\" he said, \"how can I leave you? I will not leave you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you can and must,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" he asked, looking at her in dismay.\r\n\r\n\"You know the reason,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"Know it?\" he cried. \"I know why I should stay. I know that I love you\r\nwith my whole heart and soul. I know that I love you as few men have ever\r\nloved--and that you are the one woman among millions who can inspire such\r\na love.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Bob, no,\" she said, striving hard to keep her head, withdrawing her\r\nhand that it might not betray the treason of her lips. Aware, strange as\r\nit may seem, of the absurdity of the source of what she was to say, for a\r\ntrace of a smile was about her mouth as she gazed at the coals. \"You will\r\nget over this. You are not yet out of college, and many such fancies\r\nhappen there.\"\r\n\r\nFor the moment he was incapable of speaking, incapable of finding an\r\nanswer sufficiently emphatic. How was he to tell her of the rocks upon\r\nwhich his love was built?\r\n\r\nHow was he to declare that the very perils which threatened her had made\r\na man of him, with all of a man's yearning to share these perils and\r\nshield her from them? How was he to speak at all of those perils? He did\r\nnot declaim, yet when he spoke, an enduring sincerity which she could not\r\ndeny was in his voice.\r\n\r\n\"You know in your heart that what you say is not true, Cynthia. Whatever\r\nhappens, I shall always love you.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever happens: She shuddered at the words, reminding her as they did\r\nof all her vague misgivings and fears.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever happens!\" she found herself repeating them involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, whatever happens I will love you truly and faithfully. I will never\r\ndesert you, never deny you, as long as I live. And you love me, Cynthia,\"\r\nhe cried, \"you love me, I know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" she answered, her breath coming fast. He was on his feet now,\r\ndangerously near her, and she rose swiftly to avoid him.\r\n\r\nShe turned her head, that he might not read the denial in her eyes; and\r\nyet had to look at him again, for he was coming toward her quickly.\r\n\"Don't touch me,\" she said, \"don't touch me.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and looked at her so pitifully that she could scarce keep\r\nback her tears.\r\n\r\n\"You do love me,\" he repeated.\r\n\r\nSo they stood for a moment, while Cynthia made a supreme effort to speak\r\ncalmly.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Bob,\" she said at last, \"if you ever wish to see me again, you\r\nmust do as I say. You must write to your father, and tell him what you\r\nhave done and--and what you wish to do. You may come to me and tell me\r\nhis answer, but you must not come to me before.\" She would have said\r\nmore, but her strength was almost gone. Yes, and more would have implied\r\na promise or a concession. She would not bind herself even by a hint. But\r\nof this she was sure: that she would not be the means of wrecking his\r\nopportunities. \"And now--you must go.\"\r\n\r\nHe stayed where he was, though his blood leaped within him, his\r\nadmiration and respect for the girl outran his passion. Robert\r\nWorthington was a gentleman.\r\n\r\n\"I will do as you say, Cynthia,\" he answered, \"but I am doing it for you.\r\nWhatever my father's reply may be will not change my love or my\r\nintentions. For I am determined that you shall be my wife.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, and one long, lingering look, he turned and left her.\r\nHe had lacked the courage to speak of his father's bitterness and\r\nanimosity. Who will blame him? Cynthia thought none the less of him for\r\nnot telling her. There was, indeed, no need now to describe Dudley\r\nWorthington's feelings.\r\n\r\nWhen the door had closed she stoke to the window, and listened to his\r\nfootfalls in the snow until she heard them no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Coniston, Book III., by Winston Churchill",
