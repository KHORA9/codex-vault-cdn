Moreover, the\r\ncircumstances of this, the third assassination of an American\r\nPresident, have a peculiarly sinister significance. Both President\r\nLincoln and President Garfield were killed by assassins of types\r\nunfortunately not uncommon in history; President Lincoln falling a\r\nvictim to the terrible passions aroused by four years of civil war, and\r\nPresident Garfield to the revengeful vanity of a disappointed\r\noffice-seeker. President McKinley was killed by an utterly depraved\r\ncriminal belonging to that body of criminals who object to all\r\ngovernments, good and bad alike, who are against any form of popular\r\nliberty if it is guaranteed by even the most just and liberal laws, and\r\nwho are as hostile to the upright exponent of a free people's sober\r\nwill as to the tyrannical and irresponsible despot.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that at the time of President McKinley's\r\ndeath he was the most widely loved man in all the United States; while\r\nwe have never had any public man of his position who has been so wholly\r\nfree from the bitter animosities incident to public life. His political\r\nopponents were the first to bear the heartiest and most generous\r\ntribute to the broad kindliness of nature, the sweetness and gentleness\r\nof character which so endeared him to his close associates. To a\r\nstandard of lofty integrity in public life he united the tender\r\naffections and home virtues which are all-important in the make-up of\r\nnational character. A gallant soldier in the great war for the Union,\r\nhe also shone as an example to all our people because of his conduct in\r\nthe most sacred and intimate of home relations. There could be no\r\npersonal hatred of him, for he never acted with aught but consideration\r\nfor the welfare of others. No one could fail to respect him who knew\r\nhim in public or private life. The defenders of those murderous\r\ncriminals who seek to excuse their criminality by asserting that it is\r\nexercised for political ends, inveigh against wealth and irresponsible\r\npower. But for this assassination even this base apology cannot be\r\nurged.\r\n\r\nPresident McKinley was a man of moderate means, a man whose stock\r\nsprang from the sturdy tillers of the soil, who had himself belonged\r\namong the wage-workers, who had entered the Army as a private soldier.\r\nWealth was not struck at when the President was assassinated, but the\r\nhonest toil which is content with moderate gains after a lifetime of\r\nunremitting labor, largely in the service of the public. Still less was\r\npower struck at in the sense that power is irresponsible or centered in\r\nthe hands of any one individual. The blow was not aimed at tyranny or\r\nwealth. It was aimed at one of the strongest champions the wage-worker\r\nhas ever had; at one of the most faithful representatives of the system\r\nof public rights and representative government who has ever risen to\r\npublic office. President McKinley filled that political office for\r\nwhich the entire people vote, and no President not even Lincoln\r\nhimself--was ever more earnestly anxious to represent the well\r\nthought-out wishes of the people; his one anxiety in every crisis was\r\nto keep in closest touch with the people--to find out what they thought\r\nand to endeavor to give expression to their thought, after having\r\nendeavored to guide that thought aright. He had just been reelected to\r\nthe Presidency because the majority of our citizens, the majority of\r\nour farmers and wage-workers, believed that he had faithfully upheld\r\ntheir interests for four years. They felt themselves in close and\r\nintimate touch with him. They felt that he represented so well and so\r\nhonorably all their ideals and aspirations that they wished him to\r\ncontinue for another four years to represent them.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the man at whom the assassin struck That there might be\r\nnothing lacking to complete the Judas-like infamy of his act, he took\r\nadvantage of an occasion when the President was meeting the people\r\ngenerally; and advancing as if to take the hand out-stretched to him in\r\nkindly and brotherly fellowship, he turned the noble and generous\r\nconfidence of the victim into an opportunity to strike the fatal blow.\r\nThere is no baser deed in all the annals of crime.\r\n\r\nThe shock, the grief of the country, are bitter in the minds of all who\r\nsaw the dark days, while the President yet hovered between life and\r\ndeath. At last the light was stilled in the kindly eyes and the breath\r\nwent from the lips that even in mortal agony uttered no words save of\r\nforgiveness to his murderer, of love for his friends, and of faltering\r\ntrust in the will of the Most High. Such a death, crowning the glory of\r\nsuch a life, leaves us with infinite sorrow, but with such pride in\r\nwhat he had accomplished and in his own personal character, that we\r\nfeel the blow not as struck at him, but as struck at the Nation We\r\nmourn a good and great President who is dead; but while we mourn we are\r\nlifted up by the splendid achievements of his life and the grand\r\nheroism with which he met his death.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn from the man to the Nation, the harm done is so great as\r\nto excite our gravest apprehensions and to demand our wisest and most\r\nresolute action. This criminal was a professed anarchist, inflamed by\r\nthe teachings of professed anarchists, and probably also by the\r\nreckless utterances of those who, on the stump and in the public press,\r\nappeal to the dark and evil spirits of malice and greed, envy and\r\nsullen hatred. The wind is sowed by the men who preach such doctrines,\r\nand they cannot escape their share of responsibility for the whirlwind\r\nthat is reaped. This applies alike to the deliberate demagogue, to the\r\nexploiter of sensationalism, and to the crude and foolish visionary\r\nwho, for whatever reason, apologizes for crime or excites aimless\r\ndiscontent.\r\n\r\nThe blow was aimed not at this President, but at all Presidents; at\r\nevery symbol of government. President McKinley was as emphatically the\r\nembodiment of the popular will of the Nation expressed through the\r\nforms of law as a New England town meeting is in similar fashion the\r\nembodiment of the law-abiding purpose and practice of the people of the\r\ntown. On no conceivable theory could the murder of the President be\r\naccepted as due to protest against \"inequalities in the social order,\"\r\nsave as the murder of all the freemen engaged in a town meeting could\r\nbe accepted as a protest against that social inequality which puts a\r\nmalefactor in jail. Anarchy is no more an expression of \"social\r\ndiscontent\" than picking pockets or wife-beating.\r\n\r\nThe anarchist, and especially the anarchist in the United States, is\r\nmerely one type of criminal, more dangerous than any other because he\r\nrepresents the same depravity in a greater degree. The man who\r\nadvocates anarchy directly or indirectly, in any shape or fashion, or\r\nthe man who apologizes for anarchists and their deeds, makes himself\r\nmorally accessory to murder before the fact. The anarchist is a\r\ncriminal whose perverted instincts lead him to prefer confusion and\r\nchaos to the most beneficent form of social order. His protest of\r\nconcern for workingmen is outrageous in its impudent falsity; for if\r\nthe political institutions of this country do not afford opportunity to\r\nevery honest and intelligent son of toil, then the door of hope is\r\nforever closed against him. The anarchist is everywhere not merely the\r\nenemy of system and of progress, but the deadly foe of liberty. If ever\r\nanarchy is triumphant, its triumph will last for but one red moment, to\r\nbe succeeded, for ages by the gloomy night of despotism.\r\n\r\nFor the anarchist himself, whether he preaches or practices his\r\ndoctrines, we need not have one particle more concern than for any\r\nordinary murderer. He is not the victim of social or political\r\ninjustice. There are no wrongs to remedy in his case. The cause of his\r\ncriminality is to be found in his own evil passions and in the evil\r\nconduct of those who urge him on, not in any failure by others or by\r\nthe State to do justice to him or his. He is a malefactor and nothing\r\nelse. He is in no sense, in no shape or way, a \"product of social\r\nconditions,\" save as a highwayman is \"produced\" by the fact than an\r\nunarmed man happens to have a purse. It is a travesty upon the great\r\nand holy names of liberty and freedom to permit them to be invoked in\r\nsuch a cause. No man or body of men preaching anarchistic doctrines\r\nshould be allowed at large any more than if preaching the murder of\r\nsome specified private individual. Anarchistic speeches, writings, and\r\nmeetings are essentially seditious and treasonable.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend to the Congress that in the exercise of its wise\r\ndiscretion it should take into consideration the coming to this country\r\nof anarchists or persons professing principles hostile to all\r\ngovernment and justifying the murder of those placed in authority. Such\r\nindividuals as those who not long ago gathered in open meeting to\r\nglorify the murder of King Humbert of Italy perpetrate a crime, and the\r\nlaw should ensure their rigorous punishment. They and those like them\r\nshould be kept out of this country; and if found here they should be\r\npromptly deported to the country whence they came; and far-reaching\r\nprovision should be made for the punishment of those who stay. No\r\nmatter calls more urgently for the wisest thought of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Federal courts should be given jurisdiction over any man who kills\r\nor attempts to kill the President or any man who by the Constitution or\r\nby law is in line of succession for the Presidency, while the\r\npunishment for an unsuccessful attempt should be proportioned to the\r\nenormity of the offense against our institutions.\r\n\r\nAnarchy is a crime against the whole human race; and all mankind should\r\nband against the anarchist. His crime should be made an offense against\r\nthe law of nations, like piracy and that form of man-stealing known as\r\nthe slave trade; for it is of far blacker infamy than either. It should\r\nbe so declared by treaties among all civilized powers. Such treaties\r\nwould give to the Federal Government the power of dealing with the\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nA grim commentary upon the folly of the anarchist position was afforded\r\nby the attitude of the law toward this very criminal who had just taken\r\nthe life of the President. The people would have torn him limb from\r\nlimb if it had not been that the law he defied was at once invoked in\r\nhis behalf. So far from his deed being committed on behalf of the\r\npeople against the Government, the Government was obliged at once to\r\nexert its full police power to save him from instant death at the hands\r\nof the people. Moreover, his deed worked not the slightest dislocation\r\nin our governmental system, and the danger of a recurrence of such\r\ndeeds, no matter how great it might grow, would work only in the\r\ndirection of strengthening and giving harshness to the forces of order.\r\nNo man will ever be restrained from becoming President by any fear as\r\nto his personal safety. If the risk to the President's life became\r\ngreat, it would mean that the office would more and more come to be\r\nfilled by men of a spirit which would make them resolute and merciless\r\nin dealing with every friend of disorder. This great country will not\r\nfall into anarchy, and if anarchists should ever become a serious\r\nmenace to its institutions, they would not merely be stamped out, but\r\nwould involve in their own ruin every active or passive sympathizer\r\nwith their doctrines. The American people are slow to wrath, but when\r\ntheir wrath is once kindled it burns like a consuming flame.\r\n\r\nDuring the last five years business confidence has been restored, and\r\nthe nation is to be congratulated because of its present abounding\r\nprosperity. Such prosperity can never be created by law alone, although\r\nit is easy enough to destroy it by mischievous laws. If the hand of the\r\nLord is heavy upon any country, if flood or drought comes, human wisdom\r\nis powerless to avert the calamity. Moreover, no law can guard us\r\nagainst the consequences of our own folly. The men who are idle or\r\ncredulous, the men who seek gains not by genuine work with head or hand\r\nbut by gambling in any form, are always a source of menace not only to\r\nthemselves but to others. If the business world loses its head, it\r\nloses what legislation cannot supply. Fundamentally the welfare of each\r\ncitizen, and therefore the welfare of the aggregate of citizens which\r\nmakes the nation, must rest upon individual thrift and energy,\r\nresolution, and intelligence. Nothing can take the place of this\r\nindividual capacity; but wise legislation and honest and intelligent\r\nadministration can give it the fullest scope, the largest opportunity\r\nto work to good effect.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous and highly complex industrial development which went on\r\nwith ever accelerated rapidity during the latter half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury brings us face to face, at the beginning of the twentieth, with\r\nvery serious social problems. The old laws, and the old customs which\r\nhad almost the binding force of law, were once quite sufficient to\r\nregulate the accumulation and distribution of wealth. Since the\r\nindustrial changes which have so enormously increased the productive\r\npower of mankind, they are no longer sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe growth of cities has gone on beyond comparison faster than the\r\ngrowth of the country, and the upbuilding of the great industrial\r\ncenters has meant a startling increase, not merely in the aggregate of\r\nwealth, but in the number of very large individual, and especially of\r\nvery large corporate, fortunes. The creation of these great corporate\r\nfortunes has not been due to the tariff nor to any other governmental\r\naction, but to natural causes in the business world, operating in other\r\ncountries as they operate in our own.\r\n\r\nThe process has aroused much antagonism, a great part of which is\r\nwholly without warrant. It is not true that as the rich have grown\r\nricher the poor have grown poorer. On the contrary, never before has\r\nthe average man, the wage-worker, the farmer, the small trader, been so\r\nwell off as in this country and at the present time. There have been\r\nabuses connected with the accumulation of wealth; yet it remains true\r\nthat a fortune accumulated in legitimate business can be accumulated by\r\nthe person specially benefited only on condition of conferring immense\r\nincidental benefits upon others. Successful enterprise, of the type\r\nwhich benefits all mankind, can only exist if the conditions are such\r\nas to offer great prizes as the rewards of success.\r\n\r\nThe captains of industry who have driven the railway systems across\r\nthis continent, who have built up our commerce, who have developed our\r\nmanufactures, have on the whole done great good to our people. Without\r\nthem the material development of which we are so justly proud could\r\nnever have taken place. Moreover, we should recognize the immense\r\nimportance of this material development of leaving as unhampered as is\r\ncompatible with the public good the strong and forceful men upon whom\r\nthe success of business operations inevitably rests. The slightest\r\nstudy of business conditions will satisfy anyone capable of forming a\r\njudgment that the personal equation is the most important factor in a\r\nbusiness operation; that the business ability of the man at the head of\r\nany business concern, big or little, is usually the factor which fixes\r\nthe gulf between striking success and hopeless failure.\r\n\r\nAn additional reason for caution in dealing with corporations is to be\r\nfound in the international commercial conditions of to-day. The same\r\nbusiness conditions which have produced the great aggregations of\r\ncorporate and individual wealth have made them very potent factors in\r\ninternational Commercial competition. Business concerns which have the\r\nlargest means at their disposal and are managed by the ablest men are\r\nnaturally those which take the lead in the strife for commercial\r\nsupremacy among the nations of the world. America has only just begun\r\nto assume that commanding position in the international business world\r\nwhich we believe will more and more be hers. It is of the utmost\r\nimportance that this position be not jeoparded, especially at a time\r\nwhen the overflowing abundance of our own natural resources and the\r\nskill, business energy, and mechanical aptitude of our people make\r\nforeign markets essential. Under such conditions it would be most\r\nunwise to cramp or to fetter the youthful strength of our Nation.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it cannot too often be pointed out that to strike with\r\nignorant violence at the interests of one set of men almost inevitably\r\nendangers the interests of all. The fundamental rule in our national\r\nlife--the rule which underlies all others--is that, on the whole, and\r\nin the long run, we shall go up or down together. There are exceptions;\r\nand in times of prosperity some will prosper far more, and in times of\r\nadversity, some will suffer far more, than others; but speaking\r\ngenerally, a period of good times means that all share more or less in\r\nthem, and in a period of hard times all feel the stress to a greater or\r\nless degree. It surely ought not to be necessary to enter into any\r\nproof of this statement; the memory of the lean years which began in\r\n1893 is still vivid, and we can contrast them with the conditions in\r\nthis very year which is now closing. Disaster to great business\r\nenterprises can never have its effects limited to the men at the top.\r\nIt spreads throughout, and while it is bad for everybody, it is worst\r\nfor those farthest down. The capitalist may be shorn of his luxuries;\r\nbut the wage-worker may be deprived of even bare necessities.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of modern business is so delicate that extreme care must\r\nbe taken not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or ignorance.\r\nMany of those who have made it their vocation to denounce the great\r\nindustrial combinations which are popularly, although with technical\r\ninaccuracy, known as \"trusts,\" appeal especially to hatred and fear.\r\nThese are precisely the two emotions, particularly when combined with\r\nignorance, which unfit men for the exercise of cool and steady\r\njudgment. In facing new industrial conditions, the whole history of the\r\nworld shows that legislation will generally be both unwise and\r\nineffective unless undertaken after calm inquiry and with sober\r\nself-restraint. Much of the legislation directed at the trusts would\r\nhave been exceedingly mischievous had it not also been entirely\r\nineffective. In accordance with a well-known sociological law, the\r\nignorant or reckless agitator has been the really effective friend of\r\nthe evils which he has been nominally opposing. In dealing with\r\nbusiness interests, for the Government to undertake by crude and\r\nill-considered legislation to do what may turn out to be bad, would be\r\nto incur the risk of such far-reaching national disaster that it would\r\nbe preferable to undertake nothing at all. The men who demand the\r\nimpossible or the undesirable serve as the allies of the forces with\r\nwhich they are nominally at war, for they hamper those who would\r\nendeavor to find out in rational fashion what the wrongs really are and\r\nto what extent and in what manner it is practicable to apply remedies.\r\n\r\nAll this is true; and yet it is also true that there are real and grave\r\nevils, one of the chief being over-capitalization because of its many\r\nbaleful consequences; and a resolute and practical effort must be made\r\nto correct these evils.\r\n\r\nThere is a widespread conviction in the minds of the American people\r\nthat the great corporations known as trusts are in certain of their\r\nfeatures and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare. This springs\r\nfrom no spirit of envy or uncharitableness, nor lack of pride in the\r\ngreat industrial achievements that have placed this country at the head\r\nof the nations struggling for commercial supremacy. It does not rest\r\nupon a lack of intelligent appreciation of the necessity of meeting\r\nchanging and changed conditions of trade with new methods, nor upon\r\nignorance of the fact that combination of capital in the effort to\r\naccomplish great things is necessary when the world's progress demands\r\nthat great things be done. It is based upon sincere conviction that\r\ncombination and concentration should be, not prohibited, but supervised\r\nand within reasonable limits controlled; and in my judgment this\r\nconviction is right.\r\n\r\nIt is no limitation upon property rights or freedom of contract to\r\nrequire that when men receive from Government the privilege of doing\r\nbusiness under corporate form, which frees them from individual\r\nresponsibility, and enables them to call into their enterprises the\r\ncapital of the public, they shall do so upon absolutely truthful\r\nrepresentations as to the value of the property in which the capital is\r\nto be invested. Corporations engaged in interstate commerce should be\r\nregulated if they are found to exercise a license working to the public\r\ninjury. It should be as much the aim of those who seek for social\r\nbetterment to rid the business world of crimes of cunning as to rid the\r\nentire body politic of crimes of violence. Great corporations exist\r\nonly because they are created and safeguarded by our institutions; and\r\nit is therefore our right and our duty to see that they work in harmony\r\nwith these institutions.\r\n\r\nThe first essential in determining how to deal with the great\r\nindustrial combinations is knowledge of the facts--publicity. In the\r\ninterest of the public, the Government should have the right to inspect\r\nand examine the workings of the great corporations engaged in\r\ninterstate business. Publicity is the only sure remedy which we can now\r\ninvoke. What further remedies are needed in the way of governmental\r\nregulation, or taxation, can only be determined after publicity has\r\nbeen obtained, by process of law, and in the course of administration.\r\nThe first requisite is knowledge, full and complete--knowledge which\r\nmay be made public to the world.\r\n\r\nArtificial bodies, such as corporations and joint stock or other\r\nassociations, depending upon any statutory law for their existence or\r\nprivileges, should be subject to proper governmental supervision, and\r\nfull and accurate information as to their operations should be made\r\npublic regularly at reasonable intervals.\r\n\r\nThe large corporations, commonly called trusts, though organized in one\r\nState, always do business in many States, often doing very little\r\nbusiness in the State where they are incorporated. There is utter lack\r\nof uniformity in the State laws about them; and as no State has any\r\nexclusive interest in or power over their acts, it has in practice\r\nproved impossible to get adequate regulation through State action.\r\nTherefore, in the interest of the whole people, the Nation should,\r\nwithout interfering with the power of the States in the matter itself,\r\nalso assume power of supervision and regulation over all corporations\r\ndoing an interstate business. This is especially true where the\r\ncorporation derives a portion of its wealth from the existence of some\r\nmonopolistic element or tendency in its business. There would be no\r\nhardship in such supervision; banks are subject to it, and in their\r\ncase it is now accepted as a simple matter of course. Indeed, it is\r\nprobable that supervision of corporations by the National Government\r\nneed not go so far as is now the case with the supervision exercised\r\nover them by so conservative a State as Massachusetts, in order to\r\nproduce excellent results.\r\n\r\nWhen the Constitution was adopted, at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, no human wisdom could foretell the sweeping changes, alike in\r\nindustrial and political conditions, which were to take place by the\r\nbeginning of the twentieth century. At that time it was accepted as a\r\nmatter of course that the several States were the proper authorities to\r\nregulate, so far as was then necessary, the comparatively insignificant\r\nand strictly localized corporate bodies of the day. The conditions are\r\nnow wholly different and wholly different action is called for. I\r\nbelieve that a law can be framed which will enable the National\r\nGovernment to exercise control along the lines above indicated;\r\nprofiting by the experience gained through the passage and\r\nadministration of the Interstate-Commerce Act. If, however, the\r\njudgment of the Congress is that it lacks the constitutional power to\r\npass such an act, then a constitutional amendment should be submitted\r\nto confer the power.\r\n\r\nThere should be created a Cabinet officer, to be known as Secretary of\r\nCommerce and Industries, as provided in the bill introduced at the last\r\nsession of the Congress. It should be his province to deal with\r\ncommerce in its broadest sense; including among many other things\r\nwhatever concerns labor and all matters affecting the great business\r\ncorporations and our merchant marine.\r\n\r\nThe course proposed is one phase of what should be a comprehensive and\r\nfar-reaching scheme of constructive statesmanship for the purpose of\r\nbroadening our markets, securing our business interests on a safe\r\nbasis, and making firm our new position in the international industrial\r\nworld; while scrupulously safeguarding the rights of wage-worker and\r\ncapitalist, of investor and private citizen, so as to secure equity as\r\nbetween man and man in this Republic.\r\n\r\nWith the sole exception of the farming interest, no one matter is of\r\nsuch vital moment to our whole people as the welfare of the\r\nwage-workers. If the farmer and the wage-worker are well off, it is\r\nabsolutely certain that all others will be well off too. It is\r\ntherefore a matter for hearty congratulation that on the whole wages\r\nare higher to-day in the United States than ever before in our history,\r\nand far higher than in any other country. The standard of living is\r\nalso higher than ever before. Every effort of legislator and\r\nadministrator should be bent to secure the permanency of this condition\r\nof things and its improvement wherever possible. Not only must our\r\nlabor be protected by the tariff, but it should also be protected so\r\nfar as it is possible from the presence in this country of any laborers\r\nbrought over by contract, or of those who, coming freely, yet represent\r\na standard of living so depressed that they can undersell our men in\r\nthe labor market and drag them to a lower level. I regard it as\r\nnecessary, with this end in view, to re-enact immediately the law\r\nexcluding Chinese laborers and to strengthen it wherever necessary in\r\norder to make its enforcement entirely effective.\r\n\r\nThe National Government should demand the highest quality of service\r\nfrom its employees; and in return it should be a good employer. If\r\npossible legislation should be passed, in connection with the\r\nInterstate Commerce Law, which will render effective the efforts of\r\ndifferent States to do away with the competition of convict contract\r\nlabor in the open labor market. So far as practicable under the\r\nconditions of Government work, provision should be made to render the\r\nenforcement of the eight-hour law easy and certain. In all industries\r\ncarried on directly or indirectly for the United States Government\r\nwomen and children should be protected from excessive hours of labor,\r\nfrom night work, and from work under unsanitary conditions. The\r\nGovernment should provide in its contracts that all work should be done\r\nunder \"fair\" conditions, and in addition to setting a high standard\r\nshould uphold it by proper inspection, extending if necessary to the\r\nsubcontractors. The Government should forbid all night work for women\r\nand children, as well as excessive overtime. For the District of\r\nColumbia a good factory law should be passed; and, as a powerful\r\nindirect aid to such laws, provision should be made to turn the\r\ninhabited alleys, the existence of which is a reproach to our Capital\r\ncity, into minor streets, where the inhabitants can live under\r\nconditions favorable to health and morals.\r\n\r\nAmerican wage-workers work with their heads as well as their hands.\r\nMoreover, they take a keen pride in what they are doing; so that,\r\nindependent of the reward, they wish to turn out a perfect job. This is\r\nthe great secret of our success in competition with the labor of\r\nforeign countries.\r\n\r\nThe most vital problem with which this country, and for that matter the\r\nwhole civilized world, has to deal, is the problem which has for one\r\nside the betterment of social conditions, moral and physical, in large\r\ncities, and for another side the effort to deal with that tangle of\r\nfar-reaching questions which we group together when we speak of\r\n\"labor.\" The chief factor in the success of each man--wage-worker,\r\nfarmer, and capitalist alike--must ever be the sum total of his own\r\nindividual qualities and abilities. Second only to this comes the power\r\nof acting in combination or association with others. Very great good\r\nhas been and will be accomplished by associations or unions of\r\nwage-workers, when managed with forethought, and when they combine\r\ninsistence upon their own rights with law-abiding respect for the\r\nrights of others. The display of these qualities in such bodies is a\r\nduty to the nation no less than to the associations themselves.\r\nFinally, there must also in many cases be action by the Government in\r\norder to safeguard the rights and interests of all. Under our\r\nConstitution there is much more scope for such action by the State and\r\nthe municipality than by the nation. But on points such as those\r\ntouched on above the National Government can act.\r\n\r\nWhen all is said and done, the rule of brotherhood remains as the\r\nindispensable prerequisite to success in the kind of national life for\r\nwhich we strive. Each man must work for himself, and unless he so works\r\nno outside help can avail him; but each man must remember also that he\r\nis indeed his brother's keeper, and that while no man who refuses to\r\nwalk can be carried with advantage to himself or anyone else, yet that\r\neach at times stumbles or halts, that each at times needs to have the\r\nhelping hand outstretched to him. To be permanently effective, aid must\r\nalways take the form of helping a man to help himself; and we can all\r\nbest help ourselves by joining together in the work that is of common\r\ninterest to all.\r\n\r\nOur present immigration laws are unsatisfactory. We need every honest\r\nand efficient immigrant fitted to become an American citizen, every\r\nimmigrant who comes here to stay, who brings here a strong body, a\r\nstout heart, a good head, and a resolute purpose to do his duty well in\r\nevery way and to bring up his children as law-abiding and God-fearing\r\nmembers of the community. But there should be a comprehensive law\r\nenacted with the object of working a threefold improvement over our\r\npresent system. First, we should aim to exclude absolutely not only all\r\npersons who are known to be believers in anarchistic principles or\r\nmembers of anarchistic societies, but also all persons who are of a low\r\nmoral tendency or of unsavory reputation. This means that we should\r\nrequire a more thorough system of inspection abroad and a more rigid\r\nsystem of examination at our immigration ports, the former being\r\nespecially necessary.\r\n\r\nThe second object of a proper immigration law ought to be to secure by\r\na careful and not merely perfunctory educational test some intelligent\r\ncapacity to appreciate American institutions and act sanely as American\r\ncitizens. This would not keep out all anarchists, for many of them\r\nbelong to the intelligent criminal class. But it would do what is also\r\nin point, that is, tend to decrease the sum of ignorance, so potent in\r\nproducing the envy, suspicion, malignant passion, and hatred of order,\r\nout of which anarchistic sentiment inevitably springs. Finally, all\r\npersons should be excluded who are below a certain standard of economic\r\nfitness to enter our industrial field as competitors with American\r\nlabor. There should be proper proof of personal capacity to earn an\r\nAmerican living and enough money to insure a decent start under\r\nAmerican conditions. This would stop the influx of cheap labor, and the\r\nresulting competition which gives rise to so much of bitterness in\r\nAmerican industrial life; and it would dry up the springs of the\r\npestilential social conditions in our great cities, where anarchistic\r\norganizations have their greatest possibility of growth.\r\n\r\nBoth the educational and economic tests in a wise immigration law\r\nshould be designed to protect and elevate the general body politic and\r\nsocial. A very close supervision should be exercised over the steamship\r\ncompanies which mainly bring over the immigrants, and they should be\r\nheld to a strict accountability for any infraction of the law.\r\n\r\nThere is general acquiescence in our present tariff system as a\r\nnational policy. The first requisite to our prosperity is the\r\ncontinuity and stability of this economic policy. Nothing could be more\r\nunwise than to disturb the business interests of the country by any\r\ngeneral tariff change at this time. Doubt, apprehension, uncertainty\r\nare exactly what we most wish to avoid in the interest of our\r\ncommercial and material well-being. Our experience in the past has\r\nshown that sweeping revisions of the tariff are apt to produce\r\nconditions closely approaching panic in the business world. Yet it is\r\nnot only possible, but eminently desirable, to combine with the\r\nstability of our economic system a supplementary system of reciprocal\r\nbenefit and obligation with other nations. Such reciprocity is an\r\nincident and result of the firm establishment and preservation of our\r\npresent economic policy. It was specially provided for in the present\r\ntariff law.\r\n\r\nReciprocity must be treated as the handmaiden of protection. Our first\r\nduty is to see that the protection granted by the tariff in every case\r\nwhere it is needed is maintained, and that reciprocity be sought for so\r\nfar as it can safely be done without injury to our home industries.\r\nJust how far this is must be determined according to the individual\r\ncase, remembering always that every application of our tariff policy to\r\nmeet our shifting national needs must be conditioned upon the cardinal\r\nfact that the duties must never be reduced below the point that will\r\ncover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad. The\r\nwell-being of the wage-worker is a prime consideration of our entire\r\npolicy of economic legislation.\r\n\r\nSubject to this proviso of the proper protection necessary to our\r\nindustrial well-being at home, the principle of reciprocity must\r\ncommand our hearty support. The phenomenal growth of our export trade\r\nemphasizes the urgency of the need for wider markets and for a liberal\r\npolicy in dealing with foreign nations. Whatever is merely petty and\r\nvexatious in the way of trade restrictions should be avoided. The\r\ncustomers to whom we dispose of our surplus products in the long run,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, purchase those surplus products by giving us\r\nsomething in return. Their ability to purchase our products should as\r\nfar as possible be secured by so arranging our tariff as to enable us\r\nto take from them those products which we can use without harm to our\r\nown industries and labor, or the use of which will be of marked benefit\r\nto us.\r\n\r\nIt is most important that we should maintain the high level of our\r\npresent prosperity. We have now reached the point in the development of\r\nour interests where we are not only able to supply our own markets but\r\nto produce a constantly growing surplus for which we must find markets\r\nabroad. To secure these markets we can utilize existing duties in any\r\ncase where they are no longer needed for the purpose of protection, or\r\nin any case where the article is not produced here and the duty is no\r\nlonger necessary for revenue, as giving us something to offer in\r\nexchange for what we ask. The cordial relations with other nations\r\nwhich are so desirable will naturally be promoted by the course thus\r\nrequired by our own interests.\r\n\r\nThe natural line of development for a policy of reciprocity will be in\r\nconnection with those of our productions which no longer require all of\r\nthe support once needed to establish them upon a sound basis, and with\r\nthose others where either because of natural or of economic causes we\r\nare beyond the reach of successful competition.\r\n\r\nI ask the attention of the Senate to the reciprocity treaties laid\r\nbefore it by my predecessor.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the American merchant marine is such as to call for\r\nimmediate remedial action by the Congress. It is discreditable to us as\r\na Nation that our merchant marine should be utterly insignificant in\r\ncomparison to that of other nations which we overtop in other forms of\r\nbusiness. We should not longer submit to conditions under which only a\r\ntrifling portion of our great commerce is carried in our own ships. To\r\nremedy this state of things would not .merely serve to build up our\r\nshipping interests, but it would also result in benefit to all who are\r\ninterested in the permanent establishment of a wider market for\r\nAmerican products, and would provide an auxiliary force for the Navy.\r\nShips work for their own countries just as railroads work for their\r\nterminal points. Shipping lines, if established to the principal\r\ncountries with which we have dealings, would be of political as well as\r\ncommercial benefit. From every standpoint it is unwise for the United\r\nStates to continue to rely upon the ships of competing nations for the\r\ndistribution of our goods. It should be made advantageous to carry\r\nAmerican goods in American-built ships.\r\n\r\nAt present American shipping is under certain great disadvantages when\r\nput in competition with the shipping of foreign countries. Many of the\r\nfast foreign steamships, at a speed of fourteen knots or above, are\r\nsubsidized; and all our ships, sailing vessels and steamers alike,\r\ncargo carriers of slow speed and mail carriers of high speed, have to\r\nmeet the fact that the original cost of building American ships is\r\ngreater than is the case abroad; that the wages paid American officers\r\nand seamen are very much higher than those paid the officers and seamen\r\nof foreign competing countries; and that the standard of living on our\r\nships is far superior to the standard of living on the ships of our\r\ncommercial rivals.\r\n\r\nOur Government should take such action as will remedy these\r\ninequalities. The American merchant marine should be restored to the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nThe Act of March 14, 1900, intended unequivocally to establish gold as\r\nthe standard money and to maintain at a parity therewith all forms of\r\nmoney medium in use with us, has been shown to be timely and judicious.\r\nThe price of our Government bonds in the world's market, when compared\r\nwith the price of similar obligations issued by other nations, is a\r\nflattering tribute to our public credit. This condition it is evidently\r\ndesirable to maintain.\r\n\r\nIn many respects the National Banking Law furnishes sufficient liberty\r\nfor the proper exercise of the banking function; but there seems to be\r\nneed of better safeguards against the deranging influence of commercial\r\ncrises and financial panics. Moreover, the currency of the country\r\nshould be made responsive to the demands of our domestic trade and\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nThe collections from duties on imports and internal taxes continue to\r\nexceed the ordinary expenditures of the Government, thanks mainly to\r\nthe reduced army expenditures. The utmost care should be taken not to\r\nreduce the revenues so that there will be any possibility of a deficit;\r\nbut, after providing against any such contingency, means should be\r\nadopted which will bring the revenues more nearly within the limit of\r\nour actual needs. In his report to the Congress the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury considers all these questions at length, and I ask your\r\nattention to the report and recommendations.\r\n\r\nI call special attention to the need of strict economy in expenditures.\r\nThe fact that our national needs forbid us to be niggardly in providing\r\nwhatever is actually necessary to our well-being, should make us doubly\r\ncareful to husband our national resources, as each of us husbands his\r\nprivate resources, by scrupulous avoidance of anything like wasteful or\r\nreckless expenditure. Only by avoidance of spending money on what is\r\nneedless or unjustifiable can we legitimately keep our income to the\r\npoint required to meet our needs that are genuine.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 a measure was enacted for the regulation of interstate\r\nrailways, commonly known as the Interstate Commerce Act. The cardinal\r\nprovisions of that act were that railway rates should be just and\r\nreasonable and that all shippers, localities, and commodities should be\r\naccorded equal treatment. A commission was created and endowed with\r\nwhat were supposed to be the necessary powers to execute the provisions\r\nof this act. That law was largely an experiment. Experience has shown\r\nthe wisdom of its purposes, but has also shown, possibly that some of\r\nits requirements are wrong, certainly that the means devised for the\r\nenforcement of its provisions are defective. Those who complain of the\r\nmanagement of the railways allege that established rates are not\r\nmaintained; that rebates and similar devices are habitually resorted\r\nto; that these preferences are usually in favor of the large shipper;\r\nthat they drive out of business the smaller competitor; that while many\r\nrates are too low, many others are excessive; and that gross\r\npreferences are made, affecting both localities and commodities. Upon\r\nthe other hand, the railways assert that the law by its very terms\r\ntends to produce many of these illegal practices by depriving carriers\r\nof that right of concerted action which they claim is necessary to\r\nestablish and maintain non-discriminating rates.\r\n\r\nThe act should be amended. The railway is a public servant. Its rates\r\nshould be just to and open to all shippers alike. The Government should\r\nsee to it that within its jurisdiction this is so and should provide a\r\nspeedy, inexpensive, and effective remedy to that end. At the same time\r\nit must not be forgotten that our railways are the arteries through\r\nwhich the commercial lifeblood of this Nation flows. Nothing could be\r\nmore foolish than the enactment of legislation which would\r\nunnecessarily interfere with the development and operation of these\r\ncommercial agencies. The subject is one of great importance and calls\r\nfor the earnest attention of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture during the past fifteen years has\r\nsteadily broadened its work on economic lines, and has accomplished\r\nresults of real value in upbuilding domestic and foreign trade. It has\r\ngone into new fields until it is now in touch with all sections of our\r\ncountry and with two of the island groups that have lately come under\r\nour jurisdiction, whose people must look to agriculture as a\r\nlivelihood. It is searching the world for grains, grasses, fruits, and\r\nvegetables specially fitted for introduction into localities in the\r\nseveral States and Territories where they may add materially to our\r\nresources. By scientific attention to soil survey and possible new\r\ncrops, to breeding of new varieties of plants, to experimental\r\nshipments, to animal industry and applied chemistry, very practical aid\r\nhas been given our farming and stock-growing interests. The products of\r\nthe farm have taken an unprecedented place in our export trade during\r\nthe year that has just closed.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion throughout the United States has moved steadily toward a\r\njust appreciation of the value of forests, whether planted or of\r\nnatural growth. The great part played by them in the creation and\r\nmaintenance of the national wealth is now more fully realized than ever\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nWise forest protection does not mean the withdrawal of forest\r\nresources, whether of wood, water, or grass, from contributing their\r\nfull share to the welfare of the people, but, on the contrary, gives\r\nthe assurance of larger and more certain supplies. The fundamental idea\r\nof forestry is the perpetuation of forests by use. Forest protection is\r\nnot an end of itself; it is a means to increase and sustain the\r\nresources of our country and the industries which depend upon them. The\r\npreservation of our forests is an imperative business necessity. We\r\nhave come to see clearly that whatever destroys the forest, except to\r\nmake way for agriculture, threatens our well being.\r\n\r\nThe practical usefulness of the national forest reserves to the mining,\r\ngrazing, irrigation, and other interests of the regions in which the\r\nreserves lie has led to a widespread demand by the people of the West\r\nfor their protection and extension. The forest reserves will inevitably\r\nbe of still greater use in the future than in the past. Additions\r\nshould be made to them whenever practicable, and their usefulness\r\nshould be increased by a thoroughly business-like management.\r\n\r\nAt present the protection of the forest reserves rests with the General\r\nLand Office, the mapping and description of their timber with the\r\nUnited States Geological Survey, and the preparation of plans for their\r\nconservative use with the Bureau of Forestry, which is also charged\r\nwith the general advancement of practical forestry in the United\r\nStates. These various functions should be united in the Bureau of\r\nForestry, to which they properly belong. The present diffusion of\r\nresponsibility is bad from every standpoint. It prevents that effective\r\nco-operation between the Government and the men who utilize the\r\nresources of the reserves, without which the interests of both must\r\nsuffer. The scientific bureaus generally should be put under the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture. The President should have by law the power\r\nof transferring lands for use as forest reserves to the Department of\r\nAgriculture. He already has such power in the case of lands needed by\r\nthe Departments of War and the Navy.\r\n\r\nThe wise administration of the forest reserves will be not less helpful\r\nto the interests which depend on water than to those which depend on\r\nwood and grass. The water supply itself depends upon the forest. In the\r\narid region it is water, not land, which measures production. The\r\nwestern half of the United States would sustain a population greater\r\nthan that of our whole country to-day if the waters that now run to\r\nwaste were saved and used for irrigation. The forest and water problems\r\nare perhaps the most vital internal questions of the United States.\r\n\r\nCertain of the forest reserves should also be made preserves for the\r\nwild forest creatures. All of the reserves should be better protected\r\nfrom fires. Many of them need special protection because of the great\r\ninjury done by live stock, above all by sheep. The increase in deer,\r\nelk, and other animals in the Yellowstone Park shows what may be\r\nexpected when other mountain forests are properly protected by law and\r\nproperly guarded. Some of these areas have been so denuded of surface\r\nvegetation by overgrazing that the ground breeding birds, including\r\ngrouse and quail, and many mammals, including deer, have been\r\nexterminated or driven away. At the same time the water-storing\r\ncapacity of the surface has been decreased or destroyed, thus promoting\r\nfloods in times of rain and diminishing the flow of streams between\r\nrains.\r\n\r\nIn cases where natural conditions have been restored for a few years,\r\nvegetation has again carpeted the ground, birds and deer are coming\r\nback, and hundreds of persons, especially from the immediate\r\nneighborhood, come each summer to enjoy the privilege of camping. Some\r\nat least of the forest reserves should afford perpetual protection to\r\nthe native fauna and flora, safe havens of refuge to our rapidly\r\ndiminishing wild animals of the larger kinds, and free camping grounds\r\nfor the ever-increasing numbers of men and women who have learned to\r\nfind rest, health, and recreation in the splendid forests and\r\nflower-clad meadows of our mountains. The forest reserves should be set\r\napart forever for the use and benefit of our people as a whole and not\r\nsacrificed to the shortsighted greed of a few.\r\n\r\nThe forests are natural reservoirs. By restraining the streams in flood\r\nand replenishing them in drought they make possible the use of waters\r\notherwise wasted. They prevent the soil from washing, and so protect\r\nthe storage reservoirs from filling up with silt. Forest conservation\r\nis therefore an essential condition of water conservation.\r\n\r\nThe forests alone cannot, however, fully regulate and conserve the\r\nwaters of the arid region. Great storage works are necessary to\r\nequalize the flow of streams and to save the flood waters. Their\r\nconstruction has been conclusively shown to be an undertaking too vast\r\nfor private effort. Nor can it be best accomplished by the individual\r\nStates acting alone. Far-reaching interstate problems are involved; and\r\nthe resources of single States would often be inadequate. It is\r\nproperly a national function, at least in some of its features. It is\r\nas right for the National Government to make the streams and rivers of\r\nthe arid region useful by engineering works for water storage as to\r\nmake useful the rivers and harbors of the humid region by engineering\r\nworks of another kind. The storing of the floods in reservoirs at the\r\nheadwaters of our rivers is but an enlargement of our present policy of\r\nriver control, under which levees are built on the lower reaches of the\r\nsame streams.\r\n\r\nThe Government should construct and maintain these reservoirs as it\r\ndoes other public works. Where their purpose is to regulate the flow of\r\nstreams, the water should be turned freely into the channels in the dry\r\nseason to take the same course under the same laws as the natural flow.\r\n\r\nThe reclamation of the unsettled arid public lands presents a different\r\nproblem. Here it is not enough to regulate the flow of streams. The\r\nobject of the Government is to dispose of the land to settlers who will\r\nbuild homes upon it. To accomplish this object water must be brought\r\nwithin their reach.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer settlers on the arid public domain chose their homes along\r\nstreams from which they could themselves divert the water to reclaim\r\ntheir holdings. Such opportunities are practically gone. There remain,\r\nhowever, vast areas of public land which can be made available for\r\nhomestead settlement, but only by reservoirs and main-line canals\r\nimpracticable for private enterprise. These irrigation works should be\r\nbuilt by the National Government. The lands reclaimed by them should be\r\nreserved by the Government for actual settlers, and the cost of\r\nconstruction should so far as possible be repaid by the land reclaimed.\r\nThe distribution of the water, the division of the streams among\r\nirrigators, should be left to the settlers themselves in conformity\r\nwith State laws and without interference with those laws or with vested\r\nfights. The policy of the National Government should be to aid\r\nirrigation in the several States and Territories in such manner as will\r\nenable the people in the local communities to help themselves, and as\r\nwill stimulate needed reforms in the State laws and regulations\r\ngoverning irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe reclamation and settlement of the arid lands will enrich every\r\nportion of our country, just as the settlement of the Ohio and\r\nMississippi valleys brought prosperity to the Atlantic States. The\r\nincreased demand for manufactured articles will stimulate industrial\r\nproduction, while wider home markets and the trade of Asia will consume\r\nthe larger food supplies and effectually prevent Western competition\r\nwith Eastern agriculture. Indeed, the products of irrigation will be\r\nconsumed chiefly in upbuilding local centers of mining and other\r\nindustries, which would otherwise not come into existence at all. Our\r\npeople as a whole will profit, for successful home-making is but\r\nanother name for the upbuilding of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe necessary foundation has already been laid for the inauguration of\r\nthe policy just described. It would be unwise to begin by doing too\r\nmuch, for a great deal will doubtless be learned, both as to what can\r\nand what cannot be safely attempted, by the early efforts, which must\r\nof necessity be partly experimental in character. At the very beginning\r\nthe Government should make clear, beyond shadow of doubt, its intention\r\nto pursue this policy on lines of the broadest public interest. No\r\nreservoir or canal should ever be built to satisfy selfish personal or\r\nlocal interests; but only in accordance with the advice of trained\r\nexperts, after long investigation has shown the locality where all the\r\nconditions combine to make the work most needed and fraught with the\r\ngreatest usefulness to the community as a whole. There should be no\r\nextravagance, and the believers in the need of irrigation will most\r\nbenefit their cause by seeing to it that it is free from the least\r\ntaint of excessive or reckless expenditure of the public moneys.\r\n\r\nWhatever the nation does for the extension of irrigation should\r\nharmonize with, and tend to improve, the condition of those now living\r\non irrigated land. We are not at the starting point of this\r\ndevelopment. Over two hundred millions of private capital has already\r\nbeen expended in the construction of irrigation works, and many million\r\nacres of arid land reclaimed. A high degree of enterprise and ability\r\nhas been shown in the work itself; but as much cannot be said in\r\nreference to the laws relating thereto. The security and value of the\r\nhomes created depend largely on the stability of titles to water; but\r\nthe majority of these rest on the uncertain foundation of court\r\ndecisions rendered in ordinary suits at law. With a few creditable\r\nexceptions, the arid States have failed to provide for the certain and\r\njust division of streams in times of scarcity. Lax and uncertain laws\r\nhave made it possible to establish rights to water in excess of actual\r\nuses or necessities, and many streams have already passed into private\r\nownership, or a control equivalent to ownership.\r\n\r\nWhoever controls a stream practically controls the land it renders\r\nproductive, and the doctrine of private ownership of water apart from\r\nland cannot prevail without causing enduring wrong. The recognition of\r\nsuch ownership, which has been permitted to grow up in the arid\r\nregions, should give way to a more enlightened and larger recognition\r\nof the rights of the public in the control and disposal of the public\r\nwater supplies. Laws founded upon conditions obtaining in humid\r\nregions, where water is too abundant to justify hoarding it, have no\r\nproper application in a dry country.\r\n\r\nIn the arid States the only right to water which should be recognized\r\nis that of use. In irrigation this right should attach to the land\r\nreclaimed and be inseparable therefrom. Granting perpetual water rights\r\nto others than users, without compensation to the public, is open to\r\nall the objections which apply to giving away perpetual franchises to\r\nthe public utilities of cities. A few of the Western States have\r\nalready recognized this, and have incorporated in their constitutions\r\nthe doctrine of perpetual State ownership of water.\r\n\r\nThe benefits which have followed the unaided development of the past\r\njustify the nation's aid and co-operation in the more difficult and\r\nimportant work yet to be accomplished. Laws so vitally affecting homes\r\nas those which control the water supply will only be effective when\r\nthey have the sanction of the irrigators; reforms can only be final and\r\nsatisfactory when they come through the enlightenment of the people\r\nmost concerned. The larger development which national aid insures\r\nshould, however, awaken in every arid State the determination to make\r\nits irrigation system equal in justice and effectiveness that of any\r\ncountry in the civilized world. Nothing could be more unwise than for\r\nisolated communities to continue to learn everything experimentally,\r\ninstead of profiting by what is already known elsewhere. We are dealing\r\nwith a new and momentous question, in the pregnant years while\r\ninstitutions are forming, and what we do will affect not only the\r\npresent but future generations.\r\n\r\nOur aim should be not simply to reclaim the largest area of land and\r\nprovide homes for the largest number of people, but to create for this\r\nnew industry the best possible social and industrial conditions; and\r\nthis requires that we not only understand the existing situation, but\r\navail ourselves of the best experience of the time in the solution of\r\nits problems. A careful study should be made, both by the Nation and\r\nthe States, of the irrigation laws and conditions here and abroad.\r\nUltimately it will probably be necessary for the Nation to co-operate\r\nwith the several arid States in proportion as these States by their\r\nlegislation and administration show themselves fit to receive it.\r\n\r\nIn Hawaii our aim must be to develop the Territory on the traditional\r\nAmerican lines. We do not wish a region of large estates tilled by\r\ncheap labor; we wish a healthy American community of men who themselves\r\ntill the farms they own. All our legislation for the islands should be\r\nshaped with this end in view; the well-being of the average home-maker\r\nmust afford the true test of the healthy development of the islands.\r\nThe land policy should as nearly as possible be modeled on our\r\nhomestead system.\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure to say that it is hardly more necessary to report as\r\nto Puerto Rico than as to any State or Territory within our continental\r\nlimits. The island is thriving as never before, and it is being\r\nadministered efficiently and honestly. Its people are now enjoying\r\nliberty and order under the protection of the United States, and upon\r\nthis fact we congratulate them and ourselves. Their material welfare\r\nmust be as carefully and jealously considered as the welfare of any\r\nother portion of our country. We have given them the great gift of free\r\naccess for their products to the markets of the United States. I ask\r\nthe attention of the Congress to the need of legislation concerning the\r\npublic lands of Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nIn Cuba such progress has been made toward putting the independent\r\ngovernment of the island upon a firm footing that before the present\r\nsession of the Congress closes this will be an accomplished fact. Cuba\r\nwill then start as her own mistress; and to the beautiful Queen of the\r\nAntilles, as she unfolds this new page of her destiny, we extend our\r\nheartiest greetings and good wishes. Elsewhere I have discussed the\r\nquestion of reciprocity. In the case of Cuba, however, there are\r\nweighty reasons of morality and of national interest why the policy\r\nshould be held to have a peculiar application, and I most earnestly ask\r\nyour attention to the wisdom, indeed to the vital need, of providing\r\nfor a substantial reduction in the tariff duties on Cuban imports into\r\nthe United States. Cuba has in her constitution affirmed what we\r\ndesired: that she should stand, in international matters, in closer and\r\nmore friendly relations with us than with any other power; and we are\r\nbound by every consideration of honor and expediency to pass commercial\r\nmeasures in the interest of her material well-being.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines our problem is larger. They are very rich tropical\r\nislands, inhabited by many varying tribes, representing widely\r\ndifferent stages of progress toward civilization. Our earnest effort is\r\nto help these people upward along the stony and difficult path that\r\nleads to self-government. We hope to make our administration of the\r\nislands honorable to our Nation by making it of the highest benefit to\r\nthe Filipinos themselves; and as an earnest of what we intend to do, we\r\npoint to what we have done. Already a greater measure of material\r\nprosperity and of governmental honesty and efficiency has been attained\r\nin the Philippines than ever before in their history.\r\n\r\nIt is no light task for a nation to achieve the temperamental qualities\r\nwithout which the institutions of free government are but an empty\r\nmockery. Our people are now successfully governing themselves, because\r\nfor more than a thousand years they have been slowly fitting\r\nthemselves, sometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously, toward this\r\nend. What has taken us thirty generations to achieve, we cannot expect\r\nto have another race accomplish out of hand, especially when large\r\nportions of that race start very far behind the point which our\r\nancestors had reached even thirty generations ago. In dealing with the\r\nPhilippine people we must show both patience and strength, forbearance\r\nand steadfast resolution. Our aim is high. We do not desire to do for\r\nthe islanders merely what has elsewhere been done for tropic peoples by\r\neven the best foreign governments. We hope to do for them what has\r\nnever before been done for any people of the tropics--to make them fit\r\nfor self-government after the fashion of the really free nations.\r\n\r\nHistory may safely be challenged to show a single instance in which a\r\nmasterful race such as ours, having been forced by the exigencies of\r\nwar to take possession of an alien land, has behaved to its inhabitants\r\nwith the disinterested zeal for their progress that our people have\r\nshown in the Philippines. To leave the islands at this time would mean\r\nthat they would fall into a welter of murderous anarchy. Such desertion\r\nof duty on our part would be a crime against humanity. The character of\r\nGovernor Taft and of his associates and subordinates is a proof, if\r\nsuch be needed, of the sincerity of our effort to give the islanders a\r\nconstantly increasing measure of self-government, exactly as fast as\r\nthey show themselves fit to exercise it. Since the civil government was\r\nestablished not an appointment has been made in the islands with any\r\nreference to considerations of political influence, or to aught else\r\nSave the fitness of the man and the needs of the service.\r\n\r\nIn our anxiety for the welfare and progress of the Philippines, may be\r\nthat here and there we have gone too rapidly in giving them local\r\nself-government. It is on this side that our error, if any, has been\r\ncommitted. No competent observer, sincerely desirous of finding out the\r\nfacts and influenced only by a desire for the welfare of the natives,\r\ncan assert that we have not gone far enough. We have gone to the very\r\nverge of safety in hastening the process. To have taken a single step\r\nfarther or faster in advance would have been folly and weakness, and\r\nmight well have been crime. We are extremely anxious that the natives\r\nshall show the power of governing themselves. We are anxious, first for\r\ntheir sakes, and next, because it relieves us of a great burden. There\r\nneed not be the slightest fear of our not continuing to give them all\r\nthe liberty for which they are fit.\r\n\r\nThe only fear is test in our overanxiety we give them a degree of\r\nindependence for which they are unfit, thereby inviting reaction and\r\ndisaster. As fast as there is any reasonable hope that in a given\r\ndistrict the people can govern themselves, self-government has been\r\ngiven in that district. There is not a locality fitted for\r\nself-government which has not received it. But it may well be that in\r\ncertain cases it will have to be withdrawn because the inhabitants show\r\nthemselves unfit to exercise it; such instances have already occurred.\r\nIn other words, there is not the slightest chance of our failing to\r\nshow a sufficiently humanitarian spirit. The danger comes in the\r\nopposite direction.\r\n\r\nThere are still troubles ahead in the islands. The insurrection has\r\nbecome an affair of local banditti and marauders, who deserve no higher\r\nregard than the brigands of portions of the Old World. Encouragement,\r\ndirect or indirect, to these insurrectors stands on the same footing as\r\nencouragement to hostile Indians in the days when we still had Indian\r\nwars. Exactly as our aim is to give to the Indian who remains peaceful\r\nthe fullest and amplest consideration, but to have it understood that\r\nwe will show no weakness if he goes on the warpath, so we must make it\r\nevident, unless we are false to our own traditions and to the demands\r\nof civilization and humanity, that while we will do everything in our\r\npower for the Filipino who is peaceful, we will take the sternest\r\nmeasures with the Filipino who follows the path of the insurrecto and\r\nthe ladrone.\r\n\r\nThe heartiest praise is due to large numbers of the natives of the\r\nislands for their steadfast loyalty. The Macabebes have been\r\nconspicuous for their courage and devotion to the flag. I recommend\r\nthat the Secretary of War be empowered to take some systematic action\r\nin the way of aiding those of these men who are crippled in the service\r\nand the families of those who are killed.\r\n\r\nThe time has come when there should be additional legislation for the\r\nPhilippines. Nothing better can be done for the islands than to\r\nintroduce industrial enterprises. Nothing would benefit them so much as\r\nthrowing them open to industrial development. The connection between\r\nidleness and mischief is proverbial, and the opportunity to do\r\nremunerative work is one of the surest preventatives of war. Of course\r\nno business man will go into the Philippines unless it is to his\r\ninterest to do so; and it is immensely to the interest of the islands\r\nthat he should go in. It is therefore necessary that the Congress\r\nshould pass laws by which the resources of the islands can be\r\ndeveloped; so that franchises (for limited terms of years) can be\r\ngranted to companies doing business in them, and every encouragement be\r\ngiven to the incoming of business men of every kind.\r\n\r\nNot to permit this is to do a wrong to the Philippines. The franchises\r\nmust be granted and the business permitted only under regulations which\r\nwill guarantee the islands against any kind of improper exploitation.\r\nBut the vast natural wealth of the islands must be developed, and the\r\ncapital willing to develop it must be given the opportunity. The field\r\nmust be thrown open to individual enterprise, which has been the real\r\nfactor in the development of every region over which our flag has\r\nflown. It is urgently necessary to enact suitable laws dealing with\r\ngeneral transportation, mining, banking, currency, homesteads, and the\r\nuse and ownership of the lands and timber. These laws will give free\r\nplay to industrial enterprise; and the commercial development which\r\nwill surely follow will accord to the people of the islands the best\r\nproofs of the sincerity of our desire to aid them.\r\n\r\nI call your attention most earnestly to the crying need of a cable to\r\nHawaii and the Philippines, to be continued from the Philippines to\r\npoints in Asia. We should not defer a day longer than necessary the\r\nconstruction of such a cable. It is demanded not merely for commercial\r\nbut for political and military considerations.\r\n\r\nEither the Congress should immediately provide for the construction of\r\na Government cable, or else an arrangement should be made by which like\r\nadvantages to those accruing from a Government cable may be secured to\r\nthe Government by contract with a private cable company.\r\n\r\nNo single great material work which remains to be undertaken on this\r\ncontinent is of such consequence to the American people as the building\r\nof a canal across the Isthmus connecting North and South America. Its\r\nimportance to the Nation is by no means limited merely to its material\r\neffects upon our business prosperity; and yet with view to these\r\neffects alone it would be to the last degree important for us\r\nimmediately to begin it. While its beneficial effects would perhaps be\r\nmost marked upon the Pacific Coast and the Gulf and South Atlantic\r\nStates, it would also greatly benefit other sections. It is\r\nemphatically a work which it is for the interest of the entire country\r\nto begin and complete as soon as possible; it is one of those great\r\nworks which only a great nation can undertake with prospects of\r\nsuccess, and which when done are not only permanent assets in the\r\nnation's material interests, but standing monuments to its constructive\r\nability.\r\n\r\nI am glad to be able to announce to you that our negotiations on this\r\nsubject with Great Britain, conducted on both sides in a spirit of\r\nfriendliness and mutual good will and respect, have resulted in my\r\nbeing able to lay before the Senate a treaty which if ratified will\r\nenable us to begin preparations for an Isthmian canal at any time, and\r\nwhich guarantees to this Nation every right that it has ever asked in\r\nconnection with the canal. In this treaty, the old Clayton-Bulwer\r\ntreaty, so long recognized as inadequate to supply the base for the\r\nconstruction and maintenance of a necessarily American ship canal, is\r\nabrogated. It specifically provides that the United States alone shall\r\ndo the work of building and assume the responsibility of safeguarding\r\nthe canal and shall regulate its neutral use by all nations on terms of\r\nequality without the guaranty or interference of any outside nation\r\nfrom any quarter. The signed treaty will at once be laid before the\r\nSenate, and if approved the Congress can then proceed to give effect to\r\nthe advantages it secures us by providing for the building of the\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\nThe true end of every great and free people should be self-respecting\r\npeace; and this Nation most earnestly desires sincere and cordial\r\nfriendship with all others. Over the entire world, of recent years,\r\nwars between the great civilized powers have become less and less\r\nfrequent. Wars with barbarous or semi-barbarous peoples come in an\r\nentirely different category, being merely a most regrettable but\r\nnecessary international police duty which must be performed for the\r\nsake of the welfare of mankind. Peace can only be kept with certainty\r\nwhere both sides wish to keep it; but more and more the civilized\r\npeoples are realizing the wicked folly of war and are attaining that\r\ncondition of just and intelligent regard for the rights of others which\r\nwill in the end, as we hope and believe, make world-wide peace\r\npossible. The peace conference at The Hague gave definite expression to\r\nthis hope and belief and marked a stride toward their attainment.\r\n\r\nThis same peace conference acquiesced in our statement of the Monroe\r\nDoctrine as compatible with the purposes and aims of the conference.\r\n\r\nThe Monroe Doctrine should be the cardinal feature of the foreign\r\npolicy of all the nations of the two Americas, as it is of the United\r\nStates. Just seventy-eight years have passed since President Monroe in\r\nhis Annual Message announced that \"The American continents are\r\nhenceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by\r\nany European power.\" In other words, the Monroe Doctrine is a\r\ndeclaration that there must be no territorial aggrandizement by any\r\nnon-American power at the expense of any American power on American\r\nsoil. It is in no wise intended as hostile to any nation in the Old\r\nWorld. Still less is it intended to give cover to any aggression by one\r\nNew World power at the expense of any other. It is simply a step, and a\r\nlong step, toward assuring the universal peace of the world by securing\r\nthe possibility of permanent peace on this hemisphere.\r\n\r\nDuring the past century other influences have established the\r\npermanence and independence of the smaller states of Europe. Through\r\nthe Monroe Doctrine we hope to be able to safeguard like independence\r\nand secure like permanence for the lesser among the New World nations.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine has nothing to do with the commercial relations of any\r\nAmerican power, save that it in truth allows each of them to form such\r\nas it desires. In other words, it is really a guaranty of the\r\ncommercial independence of the Americas. We do not ask under this\r\ndoctrine for any exclusive commercial dealings with any other American\r\nstate. We do not guarantee any state against punishment if it\r\nmisconducts itself, provided that punishment does not take the form of\r\nthe acquisition of territory by any non-American power.\r\n\r\nOur attitude in Cuba is a sufficient guaranty of our own good faith. We\r\nhave not the slightest desire to secure any territory at the expense of\r\nany of our neighbors. We wish to work with them hand in hand, so that\r\nall of us may be uplifted together, and we rejoice over the good\r\nfortune of any of them, we gladly hail their material prosperity and\r\npolitical stability, and are concerned and alarmed if any of them fall\r\ninto industrial or political chaos. We do not wish to see any Old World\r\nmilitary power grow up on this continent, or to be compelled to become\r\na military power ourselves. The peoples of the Americas can prosper\r\nbest if left to work out their own salvation in their own way.\r\n\r\nThe work of upbuilding the Navy must be steadily continued. No one\r\npoint of our policy, foreign or domestic, is more important than this\r\nto the honor and material welfare, and above all to the peace, of our\r\nnation in the future. Whether we desire it or not, we must henceforth\r\nrecognize that we have international duties no less than international\r\nrights. Even if our flag were hauled down in the Philippines and Puerto\r\nRico, even if we decided not to build the Isthmian Canal, we should\r\nneed a thoroughly trained Navy of adequate size, or else be prepared\r\ndefinitely and for all time to abandon the idea that our nation is\r\namong those whose sons go down to the sea in ships. Unless our commerce\r\nis always to be carried in foreign bottoms, we must have war craft to\r\nprotect it.\r\n\r\nInasmuch, however, as the American people have no thought of abandoning\r\nthe path upon which they have entered, and especially in view of the\r\nfact that the building of the Isthmian Canal is fast becoming one of\r\nthe matters which the whole people are united in demanding, it is\r\nimperative that our Navy should be put and kept in the highest state of\r\nefficiency, and should be made to answer to our growing needs. So far\r\nfrom being in any way a provocation to war, an adequate and highly\r\ntrained navy is the best guaranty against war, the cheapest and most\r\neffective peace insurance. The cost of building and maintaining such a\r\nnavy represents the very lightest premium for insuring peace which this\r\nnation can possibly pay.\r\n\r\nProbably no other great nation in the world is so anxious for peace as\r\nwe are. There is not a single civilized power which has anything\r\nwhatever to fear from aggressiveness on our part. All we want is peace;\r\nand toward this end we wish to be able to secure the same respect for\r\nour rights from others which we are eager and anxious to extend to\r\ntheir rights in return, to insure fair treatment to us commercially,\r\nand to guarantee the safety of the American people.\r\n\r\nOur people intend to abide by the Monroe Doctrine and to insist upon it\r\nas the one sure means of securing the peace of the Western Hemisphere.\r\nThe Navy offers us the only means of making our insistence upon the\r\nMonroe Doctrine anything but a subject of derision to whatever nation\r\nchooses to disregard it. We desire the peace which comes as of right to\r\nthe just man armed; not the peace granted on terms of ignominy to the\r\ncraven and the weakling.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to improvise a navy after war breaks out. The ships\r\nmust be built and the men trained long in advance. Some auxiliary\r\nvessels can be turned into makeshifts which will do in default of any\r\nbetter for the minor work, and a proportion of raw men can be mixed\r\nwith the highly trained, their shortcomings being made good by the\r\nskill of their fellows; but the efficient fighting force of the Navy\r\nwhen pitted against an equal opponent will be found almost exclusively\r\nin the war ships that have been regularly built and in the officers and\r\nmen who through years of faithful performance of sea duty have been\r\ntrained to handle their formidable but complex and delicate weapons\r\nwith the highest efficiency. In the late war with Spain the ships that\r\ndealt the decisive blows at Manila and Santiago had been launched from\r\ntwo to fourteen years, and they were able to do as they did because the\r\nmen in the conning towers, the gun turrets, and the engine-rooms had\r\nthrough long years of practice at sea learned how to do their duty.\r\n\r\nOur present Navy was begun in 1882. At that period our Navy consisted\r\nof a collection of antiquated wooden ships, already almost as out of\r\nplace against modern war vessels as the galleys of Alcibiades and\r\nHamilcar--certainly as the ships of Tromp and Blake. Nor at that time\r\ndid we have men fit to handle a modern man-of-war. Under the wise\r\nlegislation of the Congress and the successful administration of a\r\nsuccession of patriotic Secretaries of the Navy, belonging to both\r\npolitical parties, the work of upbuilding the Navy went on, and ships\r\nequal to any in the world of their kind were continually added; and\r\nwhat was even more important, these ships were exercised at sea singly\r\nand in squadrons until the men aboard them were able to get the best\r\npossible service out of them. The result was seen in the short war with\r\nSpain, which was decided with such rapidity because of the infinitely\r\ngreater preparedness of our Navy than of the Spanish Navy.\r\n\r\nWhile awarding the fullest honor to the men who actually commanded and\r\nmanned the ships which destroyed the Spanish sea forces in the\r\nPhilippines and in Cuba, we must not forget that an equal meed of\r\npraise belongs to those without whom neither blow could have been\r\nstruck. The Congressmen who voted years in advance the money to lay\r\ndown the ships, to build the guns, to buy the armor-plate; the\r\nDepartment officials and the business men and wage-workers who\r\nfurnished what the Congress had authorized; the Secretaries of the Navy\r\nwho asked for and expended the appropriations; and finally the officers\r\nwho, in fair weather and foul, on actual sea service, trained and\r\ndisciplined the crews of the ships when there was no war in sight--all\r\nare entitled to a full share in the glory of Manila and Santiago, and\r\nthe respect accorded by every true American to those who wrought such\r\nsignal triumph for our country. It was forethought and preparation\r\nwhich secured us the overwhelming triumph of 1898. If we fail to show\r\nforethought and preparation now, there may come a time when disaster\r\nwill befall us instead of triumph; and should this time come, the fault\r\nwill rest primarily, not upon those whom the accident of events puts in\r\nsupreme command at the moment, but upon those who have failed to\r\nprepare in advance.\r\n\r\nThere should be no cessation in the work of completing our Navy. So far\r\ningenuity has been wholly unable to devise a substitute for the great\r\nwar craft whose hammering guns beat out the mastery of the high seas.\r\nIt is unsafe and unwise not to provide this year for several additional\r\nBattle ships and heavy armored cruisers, with auxiliary and lighter\r\ncraft in proportion; for the exact numbers and character I refer you to\r\nthe report of the Secretary of the Navy. But there is something we need\r\neven more than additional ships, and this is additional officers and\r\nmen. To provide battle ships and cruisers and then lay them up, with\r\nthe expectation of leaving them unmanned until they are needed in\r\nactual war, would be worse than folly; it would be a crime against the\r\nNation.\r\n\r\nTo send any war ship against a competent enemy unless those aboard it\r\nhave been trained by years of actual sea service, including incessant\r\ngunnery practice, would be to invite not merely disaster, but the\r\nbitterest shame and humiliation. Four thousand additional seamen and\r\none thousand additional marines should be provided; and an increase in\r\nthe officers should be provided by making a large addition to the\r\nclasses at Annapolis. There is one small matter which should be\r\nmentioned in connection with Annapolis. The pretentious and unmeaning\r\ntitle of \"naval cadet\" should be abolished; the title of \"midshipman,\"\r\nfull of historic association, should be restored.\r\n\r\nEven in time of peace a war ship should be used until it wears out, for\r\nonly so can it be kept fit to respond to any emergency. The officers\r\nand men alike should be kept as much as possible on blue water, for it\r\nis there only they can learn their duties as they should be learned.\r\nThe big vessels should be manoeuvred in squadrons containing not merely\r\nbattle ships, but the necessary proportion of cruisers and scouts. The\r\ntorpedo boats should be handled by the younger officers in such manner\r\nas will best fit the latter to take responsibility and meet the\r\nemergencies of actual warfare.\r\n\r\nEvery detail ashore which can be performed by a civilian should be so\r\nperformed, the officer being kept for his special duty in the sea\r\nservice. Above all, gunnery practice should be unceasing. It is\r\nimportant to have our Navy of adequate size, but it is even more\r\nimportant that ship for ship it should equal in efficiency any navy in\r\nthe world. This is possible only with highly drilled crews and\r\nofficers, and this in turn imperatively demands continuous and\r\nprogressive instruction in target practice, ship handling, squadron\r\ntactics, and general discipline. Our ships must be assembled in\r\nsquadrons actively cruising away from harbors and never long at anchor.\r\nThe resulting wear upon engines and hulls must be endured; a battle\r\nship worn out in long training of officers and men is well paid for by\r\nthe results, while, on the other hand, no matter in how excellent\r\ncondition, it is useless if the crew be not expert.\r\n\r\nWe now have seventeen battle ships appropriated for, of which nine are\r\ncompleted and have been commissioned for actual service. The remaining\r\neight will be ready in from two to four years, but it will take at\r\nleast that time to recruit and train the men to fight them. It is of\r\nvast concern that we have trained crews ready for the vessels by the\r\ntime they are commissioned. Good ships and good guns are simply good\r\nweapons, and the best weapons are useless save in the hands of men who\r\nknow how to fight with them. The men must be trained and drilled under\r\na thorough and well-planned system of progressive instruction, while\r\nthe recruiting must be carried on with still greater vigor. Every\r\neffort must be made to exalt the main function of the officer--the\r\ncommand of men. The leading graduates of the Naval Academy should be\r\nassigned to the combatant branches, the line and marines.\r\n\r\nMany of the essentials of success are already recognized by the General\r\nBoard, which, as the central office of a growing staff, is moving\r\nsteadily toward a proper war efficiency and a proper efficiency of the\r\nwhole Navy, under the Secretary. This General Board, by fostering the\r\ncreation of a general staff, is providing for the official and then the\r\ngeneral recognition of our altered conditions as a Nation and of the\r\ntrue meaning of a great war fleet, which meaning is, first, the best\r\nmen, and, second, the best ships.\r\n\r\nMessages and Papers of the Presidents, Theodore Roosevelt, vol. 9,\r\np.6667\r\n\r\nThe Naval Militia forces are State organizations, and are trained for\r\ncoast service, and in event of war they will constitute the inner line\r\nof defense. They should receive hearty encouragement from the General\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nBut in addition we should at once provide for a National Naval Reserve,\r\norganized and trained under the direction of the Navy Department, and\r\nsubject to the call of the Chief Executive whenever war becomes\r\nimminent. It should be a real auxiliary to the naval seagoing peace\r\nestablishment, and offer material to be drawn on at once for manning\r\nour ships in time of war. It should be composed of graduates of the\r\nNaval Academy, graduates of the Naval Militia, officers and crews of\r\ncoast-line steamers, longshore schooners, fishing vessels, and steam\r\nyachts, together with the coast population about such centers as\r\nlifesaving stations and light-houses.\r\n\r\nThe American people must either build and maintain an adequate navy or\r\nelse make up their minds definitely to accept a secondary position in\r\ninternational affairs, not merely in political, but in commercial,\r\nmatters. It has been well said that there is no surer way of courting\r\nnational disaster than to be \"opulent, aggressive, and unarmed.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to increase our Army beyond its present size at\r\nthis time. But it is necessary to keep it at the highest point of\r\nefficiency. The individual units who as officers and enlisted men\r\ncompose this Army, are, we have good reason to believe, at least as\r\nefficient as those of any other army in the entire world. It is our\r\nduty to see that their training is of a kind to insure the highest\r\npossible expression of power to these units when acting in combination.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of modern war are such as to make an infinitely heavier\r\ndemand than ever before upon the individual character and capacity of\r\nthe officer and the enlisted man, and to make it far more difficult for\r\nmen to act together with effect. At present the fighting must be done\r\nin extended order, which means that each man must act for himself and\r\nat the same time act in combination with others with whom he is no\r\nlonger in the old-fashioned elbow-to-elbow touch. Under such conditions\r\na few men of the highest excellence are worth more than many men\r\nwithout the special skill which is only found as the result of special\r\ntraining applied to men of exceptional physique and morale. But\r\nnowadays the most valuable fighting man and the most difficult to\r\nperfect is the rifleman who is also a skillful and daring rider.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of our cavalry regiments has wisely been increased. The\r\nAmerican cavalryman, trained to manoeuvre and fight with equal facility\r\non foot and on horseback, is the best type of soldier for general\r\npurposes now to be found in the world. The ideal cavalryman of the\r\npresent day is a man who can fight on foot as effectively as the best\r\ninfantryman, and who is in addition unsurpassed in the care and\r\nmanagement of his horse and in his ability to fight on horseback.\r\n\r\nA general staff should be created. As for the present staff and supply\r\ndepartments, they should be filled by details from the line, the men so\r\ndetailed returning after a while to their line duties. It is very\r\nundesirable to have the senior grades of the Army composed of men who\r\nhave come to fill the positions by the mere fact of seniority. A system\r\nshould be adopted by which there shall be an elimination grade by grade\r\nof those who seem unfit to render the best service in the next grade.\r\nJustice to the veterans of the Civil War who are still in the Army\r\nwould seem to require that in the matter of retirements they be given\r\nby law the same privileges accorded to their comrades in the Navy.\r\n\r\nThe process of elimination of the least fit should be conducted in a\r\nmanner that would render it practically impossible to apply political\r\nor social pressure on behalf of any candidate, so that each man may be\r\njudged purely on his own merits. Pressure for the promotion of civil\r\nofficials for political reasons is bad enough, but it is tenfold worse\r\nwhere applied on behalf of officers of the Army or Navy. Every\r\npromotion and every detail under the War Department must be made solely\r\nwith regard to the good of the service and to the capacity and merit of\r\nthe man himself. No pressure, political, social, or personal, of any\r\nkind, will be permitted to exercise the least effect in any question of\r\npromotion or detail; and if there is reason to believe that such\r\npressure is exercised at the instigation of the officer concerned, it\r\nwill be held to militate against him. In our Army we cannot afford to\r\nhave rewards or duties distributed save on the simple ground that those\r\nwho by their own merits are entitled to the rewards get them, and that\r\nthose who are peculiarly fit to do the duties are chosen to perform\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nEvery effort should be made to bring the Army to a constantly\r\nincreasing state of efficiency. When on actual service no work save\r\nthat directly in the line of such service should be required. The paper\r\nwork in the Army, as in the Navy, should be greatly reduced. What is\r\nneeded is proved power of command and capacity to work well in the\r\nfield. Constant care is necessary to prevent dry rot in the\r\ntransportation and commissary departments.\r\n\r\nOur Army is so small and so much scattered that it is very difficult to\r\ngive the higher officers (as well as the lower officers and the\r\nenlisted men) a chance to practice manoeuvres in mass and on a\r\ncomparatively large scale. In time of need no amount of individual\r\nexcellence would avail against the paralysis which would follow\r\ninability to work as a coherent whole, under skillful and daring\r\nleadership. The Congress should provide means whereby it will be\r\npossible to have field exercises by at least a division of regulars,\r\nand if possible also a division of national guardsmen, once a year.\r\nThese exercises might take the form of field manoeuvres; or, if on the\r\nGulf Coast or the Pacific or Atlantic Seaboard, or in the region of the\r\nGreat Lakes, the army corps when assembled could be marched from some\r\ninland point to some point on the water, there embarked, disembarked\r\nafter a couple of days' journey at some other point, and again marched\r\ninland. Only by actual handling and providing for men in masses while\r\nthey are marching, camping, embarking, and disembarking, will it be\r\npossible to train the higher officers to perform their duties well and\r\nsmoothly.\r\n\r\nA great debt is owing from the public to the men of the Army and Navy.\r\nThey should be so treated as to enable them to reach the highest point\r\nof efficiency, so that they may be able to respond instantly to any\r\ndemand made upon them to sustain the interests of the Nation and the\r\nhonor of the flag. The individual American enlisted man is probably on\r\nthe whole a more formidable fighting man than the regular of any other\r\narmy. Every consideration should be shown him, and in return the\r\nhighest standard of usefulness should be exacted from him. It is well\r\nworth while for the Congress to consider whether the pay of enlisted\r\nmen upon second and subsequent enlistments should not be increased to\r\ncorrespond with the increased value of the veteran soldier.\r\n\r\nMuch good has already come from the act reorganizing the Army, passed\r\nearly in the present year. The three prime reforms, all of them of\r\nliterally inestimable value, are, first, the substitution of four-year\r\ndetails from the line for permanent appointments in the so-called staff\r\ndivisions; second, the establishment of a corps of artillery with a\r\nchief at the head; third, the establishment of a maximum and minimum\r\nlimit for the Army. It would be difficult to overestimate the\r\nimprovement in the efficiency of our Army which these three reforms are\r\nmaking, and have in part already effected.\r\n\r\nThe reorganization provided for by the act has been substantially\r\naccomplished. The improved conditions in the Philippines have enabled\r\nthe War Department materially to reduce the military charge upon our\r\nrevenue and to arrange the number of soldiers so as to bring this\r\nnumber much nearer to the minimum than to the maximum limit established\r\nby law. There is, however, need of supplementary legislation. Thorough\r\nmilitary education must be provided, and in addition to the regulars\r\nthe advantages of this education should be given to the officers of the\r\nNational Guard and others in civil life who desire intelligently to fit\r\nthemselves for possible military duty. The officers should be given the\r\nchance to perfect themselves by study in the higher branches of this\r\nart. At West Point the education should be of the kind most apt to turn\r\nout men who are good in actual field service; too much stress should\r\nnot be laid on mathematics, nor should proficiency therein be held to\r\nestablish the right of entry to a corps d'elite. The typical American\r\nofficer of the best kind need not be a good mathematician; but he must\r\nbe able to master himself, to control others, and to show boldness and\r\nfertility of resource in every emergency.\r\n\r\nAction should be taken in reference to the militia and to the raising\r\nof volunteer forces. Our militia law is obsolete and worthless. The\r\norganization and armament of the National Guard of the several States,\r\nwhich are treated as militia in the appropriations by the Congress,\r\nshould be made identical with those provided for the regular forces.\r\nThe obligations and duties of the Guard in time of war should be\r\ncarefully defined, and a system established by law under which the\r\nmethod of procedure of raising volunteer forces should be prescribed in\r\nadvance. It is utterly impossible in the excitement and haste of\r\nimpending war to do this satisfactorily if the arrangements have not\r\nbeen made long beforehand. Provision should be made for utilizing in\r\nthe first volunteer organizations called out the training of those\r\ncitizens who have already had experience under arms, and especially for\r\nthe selection in advance of the officers of any force which may be\r\nraised; for careful selection of the kind necessary is impossible after\r\nthe outbreak of war.\r\n\r\nThat the Army is not at all a mere instrument of destruction has been\r\nshown during the last three years. In the Philippines, Cuba, and Puerto\r\nRico it has proved itself a great constructive force, a most potent\r\nimplement for the upbuilding of a peaceful civilization.\r\n\r\nNo other citizens deserve so well of the Republic as the veterans, the\r\nsurvivors of those who saved the Union. They did the one deed which if\r\nleft undone would have meant that all else in our history went for\r\nnothing. But for their steadfast prowess in the greatest crisis of our\r\nhistory, all our annals would be meaningless, and our great experiment\r\nin popular freedom and self-government a gloomy failure. Moreover, they\r\nnot only left us a united Nation, but they left us also as a heritage\r\nthe memory of the mighty deeds by which the Nation was kept united. We\r\nare now indeed one Nation, one in fact as well as in name; we are\r\nunited in our devotion to the flag which is the symbol of national\r\ngreatness and unity; and the very completeness of our union enables us\r\nall, in every part of the country, to glory in the valor shown alike by\r\nthe sons of the North and the sons of the South in the times that tried\r\nmen's souls.\r\n\r\nThe men who in the last three years have done so well in the East and\r\nthe West Indies and on the mainland of Asia have shown that this\r\nremembrance is not lost. In any serious crisis the United States must\r\nrely for the great mass of its fighting men upon the volunteer soldiery\r\nwho do not make a permanent profession of the military career; and\r\nwhenever such a crisis arises the deathless memories of the Civil War\r\nwill give to Americans the lift of lofty purpose which comes to those\r\nwhose fathers have stood valiantly in the forefront of the battle.\r\n\r\nThe merit system of making appointments is in its essence as democratic\r\nand American as the common school system itself. It simply means that\r\nin clerical and other positions where the duties are entirely\r\nnon-political, all applicants should have a fair field and no favor,\r\neach standing on his merits as he is able to show them by practical\r\ntest. Written competitive examinations offer the only available means\r\nin many cases for applying this system. In other cases, as where\r\nlaborers are employed, a system of registration undoubtedly can be\r\nwidely extended. There are, of course, places where the written\r\ncompetitive examination cannot be applied, and others where it offers\r\nby no means an ideal solution, but where under existing political\r\nconditions it is, though an imperfect means, yet the best present means\r\nof getting satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nWherever the conditions have permitted the application of the merit\r\nsystem in its fullest and widest sense, the gain to the Government has\r\nbeen immense. The navy-yards and postal service illustrate, probably\r\nbetter than any other branches of the Government, the great gain in\r\neconomy, efficiency, and honesty due to the enforcement of this\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nI recommend the passage of a law which will extend the classified\r\nservice to the District of Columbia, or will at least enable the\r\nPresident thus to extend it. In my judgment all laws providing for the\r\ntemporary employment of clerks should hereafter contain a provision\r\nthat they be selected under the Civil Service Law.\r\n\r\nIt is important to have this system obtain at home, but it is even more\r\nimportant to have it applied rigidly in our insular possessions. Not an\r\noffice should be filled in the Philippines or Puerto Rico with any\r\nregard to the man's partisan affiliations or services, with any regard\r\nto the political, social, or personal influence which he may have at\r\nhis command; in short, heed should be paid to absolutely nothing save\r\nthe man's own character and capacity and the needs of the service.\r\n\r\nThe administration of these islands should be as wholly free from the\r\nsuspicion of partisan politics as the administration of the Army and\r\nNavy. All that we ask from the public servant in the Philippines or\r\nPuerto Rico is that he reflect honor on his country by the way in which\r\nhe makes that country's rule a benefit to the peoples who have come\r\nunder it. This is all that we should ask, and we cannot afford to be\r\ncontent with less.\r\n\r\nThe merit system is simply one method of securing honest and efficient\r\nadministration of the Government; and in the long run the sole\r\njustification of any type of government lies in its proving itself both\r\nhonest and efficient.\r\n\r\nThe consular service is now organized under the provisions of a law\r\npassed in 1856, which is entirely inadequate to existing conditions.\r\nThe interest shown by so many commercial bodies throughout the country\r\nin the reorganization of the service is heartily commended to your\r\nattention. Several bills providing for a new consular service have in\r\nrecent years been submitted to the Congress. They are based upon the\r\njust principle that appointments to the service should be made only\r\nafter a practical test of the applicant's fitness, that promotions\r\nshould be governed by trustworthiness, adaptability, and zeal in the\r\nperformance of duty, and that the tenure of office should be unaffected\r\nby partisan considerations.\r\n\r\nThe guardianship and fostering of our rapidly expanding foreign\r\ncommerce, the protection of American citizens resorting to foreign\r\ncountries in lawful pursuit of their affairs, and the maintenance of\r\nthe dignity of the nation abroad, combine to make it essential that our\r\nconsuls should be men of character, knowledge and enterprise. It is\r\ntrue that the service is now, in the main, efficient, but a standard of\r\nexcellence cannot be permanently maintained until the principles set\r\nforth in the bills heretofore submitted to the Congress on this subject\r\nare enacted into law.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment the time has arrived when we should definitely make up\r\nour minds to recognize the Indian as an individual and not as a member\r\nof a tribe. The General Allotment Act is a mighty pulverizing engine to\r\nbreak up the tribal mass. It acts directly upon the family and the\r\nindividual. Under its provisions some sixty thousand Indians have\r\nalready become citizens of the United States. We should now break up\r\nthe tribal funds, doing for them what allotment does for the tribal\r\nlands; that is, they should be divided into individual holdings. There\r\nwill be a transition period during which the funds will in many cases\r\nhave to be held in trust. This is the case also with the lands. A stop\r\nshould be put upon the indiscriminate permission to Indians to lease\r\ntheir allotments. The effort should be steadily to make the Indian work\r\nlike any other man on his own ground. The marriage laws of the Indians\r\nshould be made the same as those of the whites.\r\n\r\nIn the schools the education should be elementary and largely\r\nindustrial. The need of higher education among the Indians is very,\r\nvery limited. On the reservations care should be taken to try to suit\r\nthe teaching to the needs of the particular Indian. There is no use in\r\nattempting to induce agriculture in a country suited only for cattle\r\nraising, where the Indian should be made a stock grower. The ration\r\nsystem, which is merely the corral and the reservation system, is\r\nhighly detrimental to the Indians. It promotes beggary, perpetuates\r\npauperism, and stifles industry. It is an effectual barrier to\r\nprogress. It must continue to a greater or less degree as long as\r\ntribes are herded on reservations and have everything in common. The\r\nIndian should be treated as an individual--like the white man. During\r\nthe change of treatment inevitable hardships will occur; every effort\r\nshould be made to minimize these hardships; but we should not because\r\nof them hesitate to make the change. There should be a continuous\r\nreduction in the number of agencies.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the aboriginal races few things are more important than\r\nto preserve them from the terrible physical and moral degradation\r\nresulting from the liquor traffic. We are doing all we can to save our\r\nown Indian tribes from this evil. Wherever by international agreement\r\nthis same end can be attained as regards races where we do not possess\r\nexclusive control, every effort should be made to bring it about.\r\n\r\nI bespeak the most cordial support from the Congress and the people for\r\nthe St. Louis Exposition to commemorate the One Hundredth Anniversary\r\nof the Louisiana Purchase. This purchase was the greatest instance of\r\nexpansion in our history. It definitely decided that we were to become\r\na great continental republic, by far the foremost power in the Western\r\nHemisphere. It is one of three or four great landmarks in our\r\nhistory--the great turning points in our development. It is eminently\r\nfitting that all our people should join with heartiest good will in\r\ncommemorating it, and the citizens of St. Louis, of Missouri, of all\r\nthe adjacent region, are entitled to every aid in making the\r\ncelebration a noteworthy event in our annals. We earnestly hope that\r\nforeign nations will appreciate the deep interest our country takes in\r\nthis Exposition, and our view of its importance from every standpoint,\r\nand that they will participate in securing its success. The National\r\nGovernment should be represented by a full and complete set of\r\nexhibits.\r\n\r\nThe people of Charleston, with great energy and civic spirit, are\r\ncarrying on an Exposition which will continue throughout most of the\r\npresent session of the Congress. I heartily commend this Exposition to\r\nthe good will of the people. It deserves all the encouragement that can\r\nbe given it. The managers of the Charleston Exposition have requested\r\nthe Cabinet officers to place thereat the Government exhibits which\r\nhave been at Buffalo, promising to pay the necessary expenses. I have\r\ntaken the responsibility of directing that this be done, for I feel\r\nthat it is due to Charleston to help her in her praiseworthy effort. In\r\nmy opinion the management should not be required to pay all these\r\nexpenses. I earnestly recommend that the Congress appropriate at once\r\nthe small sum necessary for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo has just closed. Both from the\r\nindustrial and the artistic standpoint this Exposition has been in a\r\nhigh degree creditable and useful, not merely to Buffalo but to the\r\nUnited States. The terrible tragedy of the President's assassination\r\ninterfered materially with its being a financial success. The\r\nExposition was peculiarly in harmony with the trend of our public\r\npolicy, because it represented an effort to bring into closer touch all\r\nthe peoples of the Western Hemisphere, and give them an increasing\r\nsense of unity. Such an effort was a genuine service to the entire\r\nAmerican public.\r\n\r\nThe advancement of the highest interests of national science and\r\nlearning and the custody of objects of art and of the valuable results\r\nof scientific expeditions conducted by the United States have been\r\ncommitted to the Smithsonian Institution. In furtherance of its\r\ndeclared purpose--for the \"increase and diffusion of knowledge among\r\nmen\"--the Congress has from time to time given it other important\r\nfunctions. Such trusts have been executed by the Institution with\r\nnotable fidelity. There should be no halt in the work of the\r\nInstitution, in accordance with the plans which its Secretary has\r\npresented, for the preservation of the vanishing races of great North\r\nAmerican animals in the National Zoological Park. The urgent needs of\r\nthe National Museum are recommended to the favorable consideration of\r\nthe Congress.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most characteristic educational movement of the past fifty\r\nyears is that which has created the modern public library and developed\r\nit into broad and active service. There are now over five thousand\r\npublic libraries in the United States, the product of this period. In\r\naddition to accumulating material, they are also striving by\r\norganization, by improvement in method, and by co-operation, to give\r\ngreater efficiency to the material they hold, to make it more widely\r\nuseful, and by avoidance of unnecessary duplication in process to\r\nreduce the cost of its administration.\r\n\r\nIn these efforts they naturally look for assistance to the Federal\r\nlibrary, which, though still the Library of Congress, and so entitled,\r\nis the one national library of the United States. Already the largest\r\nsingle collection of books on the Western Hemisphere, and certain to\r\nincrease more rapidly than any other through purchase, exchange, and\r\nthe operation of the copyright law, this library has a unique\r\nopportunity to render to the libraries of this country--to American\r\nscholarship--service of the highest importance. It is housed in a\r\nbuilding which is the largest and most magnificent yet erected for\r\nlibrary uses. Resources are now being provided which will develop the\r\ncollection properly, equip it with the apparatus and service necessary\r\nto its effective use, render its bibliographic work widely available,\r\nand enable it to become, not merely a center of research, but the chief\r\nfactor in great co-operative efforts for the diffusion of knowledge and\r\nthe advancement of learning.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of good administration, sound economy, and the advancement\r\nof science, the Census Office as now constituted should be made a\r\npermanent Government bureau. This would insure better, cheaper, and\r\nmore satisfactory work, in the interest not only of our business but of\r\nstatistic, economic, and social science.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable growth of the postal service is shown in the fact that\r\nits revenues have doubled and its expenditures have nearly doubled\r\nwithin twelve years. Its progressive development compels constantly\r\nincreasing outlay, but in this period of business energy and prosperity\r\nits receipts grow so much faster than its expenses that the annual\r\ndeficit has been steadily reduced from $11,411,779 in 1897 to\r\n$3,923,727 in 1901. Among recent postal advances the success of rural\r\nfree delivery wherever established has been so marked, and actual\r\nexperience has made its benefits so plain, that the demand for its\r\nextension is general and urgent.\r\n\r\nIt is just that the great agricultural population should share in the\r\nimprovement of the service. The number of rural routes now in operation\r\nis 6,009, practically all established within three years, and there are\r\n6,000 applications awaiting action. It is expected that the number in\r\noperation at the close of the current fiscal year will reach 8,600. The\r\nmail will then be daily carried to the doors of 5,700,000 of our people\r\nwho have heretofore been dependent upon distant offices, and one-third\r\nof all that portion of the country which is adapted to it will be\r\ncovered by this kind of service.\r\n\r\nThe full measure of postal progress which might be realized has long\r\nbeen hampered and obstructed by the heavy burden imposed on the\r\nGovernment through the intrenched and well-understood abuses which have\r\ngrown up in connection with second-class mail matter. The extent of\r\nthis burden appears when it is stated that while the second-class\r\nmatter makes nearly three-fifths of the weight of all the mail, it paid\r\nfor the last fiscal year only $4,294,445 of the aggregate postal\r\nrevenue of $111,631,193. If the pound rate of postage, which produces\r\nthe large loss thus entailed, and which was fixed by the Congress with\r\nthe purpose of encouraging the dissemination of public information,\r\nwere limited to the legitimate newspapers and periodicals actually\r\ncontemplated by the law, no just exception could be taken. That expense\r\nwould be the recognized and accepted cost of a liberal public policy\r\ndeliberately adopted for a justifiable end. But much of the matter\r\nwhich enjoys the privileged rate is wholly outside of the intent of the\r\nlaw, and has secured admission only through an evasion of its\r\nrequirements or through lax construction. The proportion of such\r\nwrongly included matter is estimated by postal experts to be one-half\r\nof the whole volume of second-class mail. If it be only one-third or\r\none-quarter, the magnitude of the burden is apparent. The Post-Office\r\nDepartment has now undertaken to remove the abuses so far as is\r\npossible by a stricter application of the law; and it should be\r\nsustained in its effort.\r\n\r\nOwing to the rapid growth of our power and our interests on the\r\nPacific, whatever happens in China must be of the keenest national\r\nconcern to us.\r\n\r\nThe general terms of the settlement of the questions growing out of the\r\nantiforeign uprisings in China of 1900, having been formulated in a\r\njoint note addressed to China by the representatives of the injured\r\npowers in December last, were promptly accepted by the Chinese\r\nGovernment. After protracted conferences the plenipotentiaries of the\r\nseveral powers were able to sign a final protocol with the Chinese\r\nplenipotentiaries on the 7th of last September, setting forth the\r\nmeasures taken by China in compliance with the demands of the joint\r\nnote, and expressing their satisfaction therewith. It will be laid\r\nbefore the Congress, with a report of the plenipotentiary on behalf of\r\nthe United States, Mr. William Woodville Rockhill, to whom high praise\r\nis due for the tact, good judgment, and energy he has displayed in\r\nperforming an exceptionally difficult and delicate task.\r\n\r\nThe agreement reached disposes in a manner satisfactory to the powers\r\nof the various grounds of complaint, and will contribute materially to\r\nbetter future relations between China and the powers. Reparation has\r\nbeen made by China for the murder of foreigners during the uprising and\r\npunishment has been inflicted on the officials, however high in rank,\r\nrecognized as responsible for or having participated in the outbreak.\r\nOfficial examinations have been forbidden for a period of five years in\r\nall cities in which foreigners have been murdered or cruelly treated,\r\nand edicts have been issued making all officials directly responsible\r\nfor the future safety of foreigners and for the suppression of violence\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nProvisions have been made for insuring the future safety of the foreign\r\nrepresentatives in Peking by setting aside for their exclusive use a\r\nquarter of the city which the powers can make defensible and in which\r\nthey can if necessary maintain permanent military guards; by\r\ndismantling the military works between the capital and the sea; and by\r\nallowing the temporary maintenance of foreign military posts along this\r\nline. An edict has been issued by the Emperor of China prohibiting for\r\ntwo years the importation of arms and ammunition into China. China has\r\nagreed to pay adequate indemnities to the states, societies, and\r\nindividuals for the losses sustained by them and for the expenses of\r\nthe military expeditions sent by the various powers to protect life and\r\nrestore order.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the joint note of December, 1900, China has\r\nagreed to revise the treaties of commerce and navigation and to take\r\nsuch other steps for the purpose of facilitating foreign trade as the\r\nforeign powers may decide to be needed.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government has agreed to participate financially in the\r\nwork of bettering the water approaches to Shanghai and to Tientsin, the\r\ncenters of foreign trade in central and northern China, and an\r\ninternational conservancy board, in which the Chinese Government is\r\nlargely represented, has been provided for the improvement of the\r\nShanghai River and the control of its navigation. In the same line of\r\ncommercial advantages a revision of the present tariff on imports has\r\nbeen assented to for the purpose of substituting specific for ad\r\nvalorem duties, and an expert has been sent abroad on the part of the\r\nUnited States to assist in this work. A list of articles to remain free\r\nof duty, including flour, cereals, and rice, gold and silver coin and\r\nbullion, has also been agreed upon in the settlement.\r\n\r\nDuring these troubles our Government has unswervingly advocated\r\nmoderation, and has materially aided in bringing about an adjustment\r\nwhich tends to enhance the welfare of China and to lead to a more\r\nbeneficial intercourse between the Empire and the modern world; while\r\nin the critical period of revolt and massacre we did our full share in\r\nsafe-guarding life and property, restoring order, and vindicating the\r\nnational interest and honor. It behooves us to continue in these paths,\r\ndoing what lies in our power to foster feelings of good will, and\r\nleaving no effort untried to work out the great policy of full and fair\r\nintercourse between China and the nations, on a footing of equal rights\r\nand advantages to all. We advocate the \"open door\" with all that it\r\nimplies; not merely the procurement of enlarged commercial\r\nopportunities on the coasts, but access to the interior by the\r\nwaterways with which China has been so extraordinarily favored. Only by\r\nbringing the people of China into peaceful and friendly community of\r\ntrade with all the peoples of the earth can the work now auspiciously\r\nbegun be carried to fruition. In the attainment of this purpose we\r\nnecessarily claim parity of treatment, under the conventions,\r\nthroughout the Empire for our trade and our citizens with those of all\r\nother powers.\r\n\r\nWe view with lively interest and keen hopes of beneficial results the\r\nproceedings of the Pan-American Congress, convoked at the invitation of\r\nMexico, and now sitting at the Mexican capital. The delegates of the\r\nUnited States are under the most liberal instructions to cooperate with\r\ntheir colleagues in all matters promising advantage to the great family\r\nof American commonwealths, as well in their relations among themselves\r\nas in their domestic advancement and in their intercourse with the\r\nworld at large.\r\n\r\nMy predecessor communicated to the Congress the fact that the Weil and\r\nLa Abra awards against Mexico have been adjudged by the highest courts\r\nof our country to have been obtained through fraud and perjury on the\r\npart of the claimants, and that in accordance with the acts of the\r\nCongress the money remaining in the hands of the Secretary of State on\r\nthese awards has been returned to Mexico. A considerable portion of the\r\nmoney received from Mexico on these awards had been paid by this\r\nGovernment to the claimants before the decision of the courts was\r\nrendered. My judgment is that the Congress should return to Mexico an\r\namount equal to the sums thus already paid to the claimants.\r\n\r\nThe death of Queen Victoria caused the people of the United States deep\r\nand heartfelt sorrow, to which the Government gave full expression.\r\nWhen President McKinley died, our Nation in turn received from every\r\nquarter of the British Empire expressions of grief and sympathy no less\r\nsincere. The death of the Empress Dowager Frederick of Germany also\r\naroused the genuine sympathy of the American people; and this sympathy\r\nwas cordially reciprocated by Germany when the President was\r\nassassinated. Indeed, from every quarter of the civilized world we\r\nreceived, at the time of the President's death, assurances of such\r\ngrief and regard as to touch the hearts of our people. In the midst of\r\nour affliction we reverently thank the Almighty that we are at peace\r\nwith the nations of mankind; and we firmly intend that our policy shall\r\nbe such as to continue unbroken these international relations of mutual\r\nrespect and good will.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nTheodore Roosevelt\r\nDecember 2, 1902\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nWe still continue in a period of unbounded prosperity. This prosperity\r\nis not the creature of law, but undoubtedly the laws under which we\r\nwork have been instrumental in creating the conditions which made it\r\npossible, and by unwise legislation it would be easy enough to destroy\r\nit. There will undoubtedly be periods of depression. The wave will\r\nrecede; but the tide will advance. This Nation is seated on a continent\r\nflanked by two great oceans. It is composed of men the descendants of\r\npioneers, or, in a sense, pioneers themselves; of men winnowed out from\r\namong the nations of the Old World by the energy, boldness, and love of\r\nadventure found in their own eager hearts. Such a Nation, so placed,\r\nwill surely wrest success from fortune.\r\n\r\nAs a people we have played a large part in the world, and we are bent\r\nupon making our future even larger than the past. In particular, the\r\nevents of the last four years have definitely decided that, for woe or\r\nfor weal, our place must be great among the nations. We may either fall\r\ngreatly or succeed greatly; but we can not avoid the endeavor from\r\nwhich either great failure or great success must come. Even if we\r\nwould, we can not play a small part. If we should try, all that would\r\nfollow would be that we should play a large part ignobly and\r\nshamefully.\r\n\r\nBut our people, the sons of the men of the Civil War, the sons of the\r\nmen who had iron in their blood, rejoice in the present and face the\r\nfuture high of heart and resolute of will. Ours is not the creed of the\r\nweakling and the coward; ours is the gospel of hope and of triumphant\r\nendeavor. We do not shrink from the struggle before us. There are many\r\nproblems for us to face at the outset of the twentieth century--grave\r\nproblems abroad and still graver at home; but we know that we can solve\r\nthem and solve them well, provided only that we bring to the solution\r\nthe qualities of head and heart which were shown by the men who, in the\r\ndays of Washington, rounded this Government, and, in the days of\r\nLincoln, preserved it.\r\n\r\nNo country has ever occupied a higher plane of material well-being than\r\nours at the present moment. This well-being is due to no sudden or\r\naccidental causes, but to the play of the economic forces in this\r\ncountry for over a century; to our laws, our sustained and continuous\r\npolicies; above all, to the high individual average of our citizenship.\r\nGreat fortunes have been won by those who have taken the lead in this\r\nphenomenal industrial development, and most of these fortunes have been\r\nwon not by doing evil, but as an incident to action which has benefited\r\nthe community as a whole. Never before has material well-being been so\r\nwidely diffused among our people. Great fortunes have been accumulated,\r\nand yet in the aggregate these fortunes are small Indeed when compared\r\nto the wealth of the people as a whole. The plain people are better off\r\nthan they have ever been before. The insurance companies, which are\r\npractically mutual benefit societies--especially helpful to men of\r\nmoderate means--represent accumulations of capital which are among the\r\nlargest in this country. There are more deposits in the savings banks,\r\nmore owners of farms, more well-paid wage-workers in this country now\r\nthan ever before in our history. Of course, when the conditions have\r\nfavored the growth of so much that was good, they have also favored\r\nsomewhat the growth of what was evil. It is eminently necessary that we\r\nshould endeavor to cut out this evil, but let us keep a due sense of\r\nproportion; let us not in fixing our gaze upon the lesser evil forget\r\nthe greater good. The evils are real and some of them are menacing, but\r\nthey are the outgrowth, not of misery or decadence, but of\r\nprosperity--of the progress of our gigantic industrial development.\r\nThis industrial development must not be checked, but side by side with\r\nit should go such progressive regulation as will diminish the evils. We\r\nshould fail in our duty if we did not try to remedy the evils, but we\r\nshall succeed only if we proceed patiently, with practical common sense\r\nas well as resolution, separating the good from the bad and holding on\r\nto the former while endeavoring to get rid of the latter.\r\n\r\nIn my Message to the present Congress at its first session I discussed\r\nat length the question of the regulation of those big corporations\r\ncommonly doing an interstate business, often with some tendency to\r\nmonopoly, which are popularly known as trusts. The experience of the\r\npast year has emphasized, in my opinion, the desirability of the steps\r\nI then proposed. A fundamental requisite of social efficiency is a high\r\nstandard of individual energy and excellence; but this is in no wise\r\ninconsistent with power to act in combination for aims which can not so\r\nwell be achieved by the individual acting alone. A fundamental base of\r\ncivilization is the inviolability of property; but this is in no wise\r\ninconsistent with the right of society to regulate the exercise of the\r\nartificial powers which it confers upon the owners of property, under\r\nthe name of corporate franchises, in such a way as to prevent the\r\nmisuse of these powers. Corporations, and especially combinations of\r\ncorporations, should be managed under public regulation. Experience has\r\nshown that under our system of government the necessary supervision can\r\nnot be obtained by State action. It must therefore be achieved by\r\nnational action. Our aim is not to do away with corporations; on the\r\ncontrary, these big aggregations are an inevitable development of\r\nmodern industrialism, and the effort to destroy them would be futile\r\nunless accomplished in ways that would work the utmost mischief to the\r\nentire body politic. We can do nothing of good in the way of regulating\r\nand supervising these corporations until we fix clearly in our minds\r\nthat we are not attacking the corporations, but endeavoring to do away\r\nwith any evil in them. We are not hostile to them; we are merely\r\ndetermined that they shall be so handled as to subserve the public\r\ngood. We draw the line against misconduct, not against wealth. The\r\ncapitalist who, alone or in conjunction with his fellows, performs some\r\ngreat industrial feat by which he wins money is a welldoer, not a\r\nwrongdoer, provided only he works in proper and legitimate lines. We\r\nwish to favor such a man when he does well. We wish to supervise and\r\ncontrol his actions only to prevent him from doing ill. Publicity can\r\ndo no harm to the honest corporation; and we need not be over tender\r\nabout sparing the dishonest corporation.  In curbing and regulating the\r\ncombinations of capital which are, or may become, injurious to the\r\npublic we must be careful not to stop the great enterprises which have\r\nlegitimately reduced the cost of production, not to abandon the place\r\nwhich our country has won in the leadership of the international\r\nindustrial world, not to strike down wealth with the result of closing\r\nfactories and mines, of turning the wage-worker idle in the streets and\r\nleaving the farmer without a market for what he grows. Insistence upon\r\nthe impossible means delay in achieving the possible, exactly as, on\r\nthe other hand, the stubborn defense alike of what is good and what is\r\nbad in the existing system, the resolute effort to obstruct any attempt\r\nat betterment, betrays blindness to the historic truth that wise\r\nevolution is the sure safeguard against revolution.\r\n\r\nNo more important subject can come before the Congress than this of the\r\nregulation of interstate business. This country can not afford to sit\r\nsupine on the plea that under our peculiar system of government we are\r\nhelpless in the presence of the new conditions, and unable to grapple\r\nwith them or to cut out whatever of evil has arisen in connection with\r\nthem. The power of the Congress to regulate interstate commerce is an\r\nabsolute and unqualified grant, and without limitations other than\r\nthose prescribed by the Constitution. The Congress has constitutional\r\nauthority to make all laws necessary and proper for executing this\r\npower, and I am satisfied that this power has not been exhausted by any\r\nlegislation now on the statute books. It is evident, therefore, that\r\nevils restrictive of commercial freedom and entailing restraint upon\r\nnational commerce fall within the regulative power of the Congress, and\r\nthat a wise and reasonable law would be a necessary and proper exercise\r\nof Congressional authority to the end that such evils should be\r\neradicated.\r\n\r\nI believe that monopolies, unjust discriminations, which prevent or\r\ncripple competition, fraudulent overcapitalization, and other evils in\r\ntrust organizations and practices which injuriously affect interstate\r\ntrade can be prevented under the power of the Congress to \"regulate\r\ncommerce with foreign nations and among the several States\" through\r\nregulations and requirements operating directly upon such commerce, the\r\ninstrumentalities thereof, and those engaged therein.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend this subject to the consideration of the Congress\r\nwith a view to the passage of a law reasonable in its provisions and\r\neffective in its operations, upon which the questions can be finally\r\nadjudicated that now raise doubts as to the necessity of constitutional\r\namendment. If it prove impossible to accomplish the purposes above set\r\nforth by such a law, then, assuredly, we should not shrink from\r\namending the Constitution so as to secure beyond peradventure the power\r\nsought.\r\n\r\nThe Congress has not heretofore made any appropriation for the better\r\nenforcement of the antitrust law as it now stands. Very much has been\r\ndone by the Department of Justice in securing the enforcement of this\r\nlaw, but much more could be done if the Congress would make a special\r\nappropriation for this purpose, to be expended under the direction of\r\nthe Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nOne proposition advocated has been the reduction of the tariff as a\r\nmeans of reaching the evils of the trusts which fall within the\r\ncategory I have described. Not merely would this be wholly ineffective,\r\nbut the diversion of our efforts in such a direction would mean the\r\nabandonment of all intelligent attempt to do away with these evils.\r\nMany of the largest corporations, many of those which should certainly\r\nbe included in any proper scheme of regulation, would not be affected\r\nin the slightest degree by a change in the tariff, save as such change\r\ninterfered with the general prosperity of the country. The only\r\nrelation of the tariff to big corporations as a whole is that the\r\ntariff makes manufactures profitable, and the tariff remedy proposed\r\nwould be in effect simply to make manufactures unprofitable. To remove\r\nthe tariff as a punitive measure directed against trusts would\r\ninevitably result in ruin to the weaker competitors who are struggling\r\nagainst them. Our aim should be not by unwise tariff changes to give\r\nforeign products the advantage over domestic products, but by proper\r\nregulation to give domestic competition a fair chance; and this end can\r\nnot be reached by any tariff changes which would affect unfavorably all\r\ndomestic competitors, good and bad alike. The question of regulation of\r\nthe trusts stands apart from the question of tariff revision.\r\n\r\nStability of economic policy must always be the prime economic need of\r\nthis country. This stability should not be fossilization. The country\r\nhas acquiesced in the wisdom of the protective-tariff principle. It is\r\nexceedingly undesirable that this system should be destroyed or that\r\nthere should be violent and radical changes therein. Our past\r\nexperience shows that great prosperity in this country has always come\r\nunder a protective tariff; and that the country can not prosper under\r\nfitful tariff changes at short intervals. Moreover, if the tariff laws\r\nas a whole work well, and if business has prospered under them and is\r\nprospering, it is better to endure for a time slight inconveniences and\r\ninequalities in some schedules than to upset business by too quick and\r\ntoo radical changes. It is most earnestly to be wished that we could\r\ntreat the tariff from the standpoint solely of our business needs. It\r\nis, perhaps, too much to hope that partisanship may be entirely\r\nexcluded from consideration of the subject, but at least it can be made\r\nsecondary to the business interests of the country--that is, to the\r\ninterests of our people as a whole. Unquestionably these business\r\ninterests will best be served if together with fixity of principle as\r\nregards the tariff we combine a system which will permit us from time\r\nto time to make the necessary reapplication of the principle to the\r\nshifting national needs. We must take scrupulous care that the\r\nreapplication shall be made in such a way that it will not amount to a\r\ndislocation of our system, the mere threat of which (not to speak of\r\nthe performance) would produce paralysis in the business energies of\r\nthe community. The first consideration in making these changes would,\r\nof course, be to preserve the principle which underlies our whole\r\ntariff system--that is, the principle of putting American business\r\ninterests at least on a full equality with interests abroad, and of\r\nalways allowing a sufficient rate of duty to more than cover the\r\ndifference between the labor cost here and abroad. The well-being of\r\nthe wage-worker, like the well-being of the tiller of the soil, should\r\nbe treated as an essential in shaping our whole economic policy. There\r\nmust never be any change which will jeopardize the standard of comfort,\r\nthe standard of wages of the American wage-worker.\r\n\r\nOne way in which the readjustment sought can be reached is by\r\nreciprocity treaties. It is greatly to be desired that such treaties\r\nmay be adopted. They can be used to widen our markets and to give a\r\ngreater field for the activities of our producers on the one hand, and\r\non the other hand to secure in practical shape the lowering of duties\r\nwhen they are no longer needed for protection among our own people, or\r\nwhen the minimum of damage done may be disregarded for the sake of the\r\nmaximum of good accomplished. If it prove impossible to ratify the\r\npending treaties, and if there seem to be no warrant for the endeavor\r\nto execute others, or to amend the pending treaties so that they can be\r\nratified, then the same end--to secure reciprocity--should be met by\r\ndirect legislation.\r\n\r\nWherever the tariff conditions are such that a needed change can not\r\nwith advantage be made by the application of the reciprocity idea, then\r\nit can be made outright by a lowering of duties on a given product. If\r\npossible, such change should be made only after the fullest\r\nconsideration by practical experts, who should approach the subject\r\nfrom a business standpoint, having in view both the particular\r\ninterests affected and the commercial well-being of the people as a\r\nwhole. The machinery for providing such careful investigation can\r\nreadily be supplied. The executive department has already at its\r\ndisposal methods of collecting facts and figures; and if the Congress\r\ndesires additional consideration to that which will be given the\r\nsubject by its own committees, then a commission of business experts\r\ncan be appointed whose duty it should be to recommend action by the\r\nCongress after a deliberate and scientific examination of the various\r\nschedules as they are affected by the changed and changing conditions.\r\nThe unhurried and unbiased report of this commission would show what\r\nchanges should be made in the various schedules, and how far these\r\nchanges could go without also changing the great prosperity which this\r\ncountry is now enjoying, or upsetting its fixed economic policy.\r\n\r\nThe cases in which the tariff can produce a monopoly are so few as to\r\nconstitute an inconsiderable factor in the question; but of course if\r\nin any case it be found that a given rate of duty does promote a\r\nmonopoly which works ill, no protectionist would object to such\r\nreduction of the duty as would equalize competition.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment, the tariff on anthracite coal should be removed, and\r\nanthracite put actually, where it now is nominally, on the free list.\r\nThis would have no effect at all save in crises; but in crises it might\r\nbe of service to the people.\r\n\r\nInterest rates are a potent factor in business activity, and in order\r\nthat these rates may be equalized to meet the varying needs of the\r\nseasons and of widely separated communities, and to prevent the\r\nrecurrence of financial stringencies which injuriously affect\r\nlegitimate business, it is necessary that there should be an element of\r\nelasticity in our monetary system. Banks are the natural servants of\r\ncommerce, and upon them should be placed, as far as practicable, the\r\nburden of furnishing and maintaining a circulation adequate to supply\r\nthe needs of our diversified industries and of our domestic and foreign\r\ncommerce; and the issue of this should be so regulated that a\r\nsufficient supply should be always available for the business interests\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nIt would be both unwise and unnecessary at this time to attempt to\r\nreconstruct our financial system, which has been the growth of a\r\ncentury; but some additional legislation is, I think, desirable. The\r\nmere outline of any plan sufficiently comprehensive to meet these\r\nrequirements would transgress the appropriate limits of this\r\ncommunication. It is suggested, however, that all future legislation on\r\nthe subject should be with the view of encouraging the use of such\r\ninstrumentalities as will automatically supply every legitimate demand\r\nof productive industries and of commerce, not only in the amount, but\r\nin the character of circulation; and of making all kinds of money\r\ninterchangeable, and, at the will of the holder, convertible into the\r\nestablished gold standard.\r\n\r\nI again call your attention to the need of passing a proper immigration\r\nlaw, covering the points outlined in my Message to you at the first\r\nsession of the present Congress; substantially such a bill has already\r\npassed the House.\r\n\r\nHow to secure fair treatment alike for labor and for capital, how to\r\nhold in check the unscrupulous man, whether employer or employee,\r\nwithout weakening individual initiative, without hampering and cramping\r\nthe industrial development of the country, is a problem fraught with\r\ngreat difficulties and one which it is of the highest importance to\r\nsolve on lines of sanity and far-sighted common sense as well as of\r\ndevotion to the right. This is an era of federation and combination.\r\nExactly as business men find they must often work through corporations,\r\nand as it is a constant tendency of these corporations to grow larger,\r\nso it is often necessary for laboring men to work in federations, and\r\nthese have become important factors of modern industrial life. Both\r\nkinds of federation, capitalistic and labor, can do much good, and as a\r\nnecessary corollary they can both do evil. Opposition to each kind of\r\norganization should take the form of opposition to whatever is bad in\r\nthe conduct of any given corporation or union--not of attacks upon\r\ncorporations as such nor upon unions as such; for some of the most\r\nfar-reaching beneficent work for our people has been accomplished\r\nthrough both corporations and unions. Each must refrain from arbitrary\r\nor tyrannous interference with the rights of others. Organized capital\r\nand organized labor alike should remember that in the long run the\r\ninterest of each must be brought into harmony with the interest of the\r\ngeneral public; and the conduct of each must conform to the fundamental\r\nrules of obedience to the law, of individual freedom, and of justice\r\nand fair dealing toward all. Each should remember that in addition to\r\npower it must strive after the realization of healthy, lofty, and\r\ngenerous ideals. Every employer, every wage-worker, must be guaranteed\r\nhis liberty and his right to do as he likes with his property or his\r\nlabor so long as he does not infringe upon the rights of others. It is\r\nof the highest importance that employer and employee alike should\r\nendeavor to appreciate each the viewpoint of the other and the sure\r\ndisaster that will come upon both in the long run if either grows to\r\ntake as habitual an attitude of sour hostility and distrust toward the\r\nother. Few people deserve better of the country than those\r\nrepresentatives both of capital and labor--and there are many such--who\r\nwork continually to bring about a good understanding of this kind,\r\nbased upon wisdom and upon broad and kindly sympathy between employers\r\nand employed. Above all, we need to remember that any kind of class\r\nanimosity in the political world is, if possible, even more wicked,\r\neven more destructive to national welfare, than sectional, race, or\r\nreligious animosity. We can get good government only upon condition\r\nthat we keep true to the principles upon which this Nation was founded,\r\nand judge each man not as a part of a class, but upon his individual\r\nmerits. All that we have a right to ask of any man, rich or poor,\r\nwhatever his creed, his occupation, his birthplace, or his residence,\r\nis that he shall act well and honorably by his neighbor and by, his\r\ncountry. We are neither for the rich man as such nor for the poor man\r\nas such; we are for the upright man, rich or poor. So far as the\r\nconstitutional powers of the National Government touch these matters of\r\ngeneral and vital moment to the Nation, they should be exercised in\r\nconformity with the principles above set forth.\r\n\r\nIt is earnestly hoped that a secretary of commerce may be created, with\r\na seat in the Cabinet. The rapid multiplication of questions affecting\r\nlabor and capital, the growth and complexity of the organizations\r\nthrough which both labor and capital now find expression, the steady\r\ntendency toward the employment of capital in huge corporations, and the\r\nwonderful strides of this country toward leadership in the\r\ninternational business world justify an urgent demand for the creation\r\nof such a position. Substantially all the leading commercial bodies in\r\nthis country have united in requesting its creation. It is desirable\r\nthat some such measure as that which has already passed the Senate be\r\nenacted into law. The creation of such a department would in itself be\r\nan advance toward dealing with and exercising supervision over the\r\nwhole subject of the great corporations doing an interstate business;\r\nand with this end in view, the Congress should endow the department\r\nwith large powers, which could be increased as experience might show\r\nthe need.\r\n\r\nI hope soon to submit to the Senate a reciprocity treaty with Cuba. On\r\nMay 20 last the United States kept its promise to the island by\r\nformally vacating Cuban soil and turning Cuba over to those whom her\r\nown people had chosen as the first officials of the new Republic.\r\n\r\nCuba lies at our doors, and whatever affects her for good or for ill\r\naffects us also. So much have our people felt this that in the Platt\r\namendment we definitely took the ground that Cuba must hereafter have\r\ncloser political relations with us than with any other power. Thus in a\r\nsense Cuba has become a part of our international political system.\r\nThis makes it necessary that in return she should be given some of the\r\nbenefits of becoming part of our economic system. It is, from our own\r\nstandpoint, a short-sighted and mischievous policy to fail to recognize\r\nthis need. Moreover, it is unworthy of a mighty and generous nation,\r\nitself the greatest and most successful republic in history, to refuse\r\nto stretch out a helping hand to a young and weak sister republic just\r\nentering upon its career of independence. We should always fearlessly\r\ninsist upon our rights in the face of the strong, and we should with\r\nungrudging hand do our generous duty by the weak. I urge the adoption\r\nof reciprocity with Cuba not only because it is eminently for our own\r\ninterests to control the Cuban market and by every means to foster our\r\nsupremacy in the tropical lands and waters south of us, but also\r\nbecause we, of the giant republic of the north, should make all our\r\nsister nations of the American Continent feel that whenever they will\r\npermit it we desire to show ourselves disinterestedly and effectively\r\ntheir friend.\r\n\r\nA convention with Great Britain has been concluded, which will be at\r\nonce laid before the Senate for ratification, providing for reciprocal\r\ntrade arrangements between the United States and Newfoundland on\r\nsubstantially the lines of the convention formerly negotiated by the\r\nSecretary of State, Mr. Blaine. I believe reciprocal trade relations\r\nwill be greatly to the advantage of both countries.\r\n\r\nAs civilization grows warfare becomes less and less the normal\r\ncondition of foreign relations. The last century has seen a marked\r\ndiminution of wars between civilized powers; wars with uncivilized\r\npowers are largely mere matters of international police duty, essential\r\nfor the welfare of the world. Wherever possible, arbitration or some\r\nsimilar method should be employed in lieu of war to settle difficulties\r\nbetween civilized nations, although as yet the world has not progressed\r\nsufficiently to render it possible, or necessarily desirable, to invoke\r\narbitration in every case. The formation of the international tribunal\r\nwhich sits at The Hague is an event of good omen from which great\r\nconsequences for the welfare of all mankind may flow. It is far better,\r\nwhere possible, to invoke such a permanent tribunal than to create\r\nspecial arbitrators for a given purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of sincere congratulation to our country that the United\r\nStates and Mexico should have been the first to use the good offices of\r\nThe Hague Court. This was done last summer with most satisfactory\r\nresults in the case of a claim at issue between us and our sister\r\nRepublic. It is earnestly to be hoped that this first case will serve\r\nas a precedent for others, in which not only the United States but\r\nforeign nations may take advantage of the machinery already in\r\nexistence at The Hague.\r\n\r\nI commend to the favorable consideration of the Congress the Hawaiian\r\nfire claims, which were the subject of careful investigation during the\r\nlast session.\r\n\r\nThe Congress has wisely provided that we shall build at once an\r\nisthmian canal, if possible at Panama. The Attorney-General reports\r\nthat we can undoubtedly acquire good title from the French Panama Canal\r\nCompany. Negotiations are now pending with Colombia to secure her\r\nassent to our building the canal. This canal will be one of the\r\ngreatest engineering feats of the twentieth century; a greater\r\nengineering feat than has yet been accomplished during the history of\r\nmankind. The work should be carried out as a continuing policy without\r\nregard to change of Administration; and it should be begun under\r\ncircumstances which will make it a matter of pride for all\r\nAdministrations to continue the policy.\r\n\r\nThe canal will be of great benefit to America, and of importance to all\r\nthe world. It will be of advantage to us industrially and also as\r\nimproving our military position. It will be of advantage to the\r\ncountries of tropical America. It is earnestly to be hoped that all of\r\nthese countries will do as some of them have already done with signal\r\nsuccess, and will invite to their shores commerce and improve their\r\nmaterial conditions by recognizing that stability and order are the\r\nprerequisites of successful development. No independent nation in\r\nAmerica need have the slightest fear of aggression from the United\r\nStates. It behoves each one to maintain order within its own borders\r\nand to discharge its just obligations to foreigners. When this is done,\r\nthey can rest assured that, be they strong or weak, they have nothing\r\nto dread from outside interference. More and more the increasing\r\ninterdependence and complexity of international political and economic\r\nrelations render it incumbent on all civilized and orderly powers to\r\ninsist on the proper policing of the world.\r\n\r\nDuring the fall of 1901 a communication was addressed to the Secretary\r\nof State, asking whether permission would be granted by the President\r\nto a corporation to lay a cable from a point on the California coast to\r\nthe Philippine Islands by way of Hawaii. A statement of conditions or\r\nterms upon which such corporation would undertake to lay and operate a\r\ncable was volunteered.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the Congress was shortly to convene, and Pacific-cable\r\nlegislation had been the subject of consideration by the Congress for\r\nseveral years, it seemed to me wise to defer action upon the\r\napplication until the Congress had first an opportunity to act. The\r\nCongress adjourned without taking any action, leaving the matter in\r\nexactly the same condition in which it stood when the Congress\r\nconvened.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it appears that the Commercial Pacific Cable Company had\r\npromptly proceeded with preparations for laying its cable. It also made\r\napplication to the President for access to and use of soundings taken\r\nby the U. S. S. Nero, for the purpose of discovering a practicable\r\nroute for a trans-Pacific cable, the company urging that with access to\r\nthese soundings it could complete its cable much sooner than if it were\r\nrequired to take soundings upon its own account. Pending consideration\r\nof this subject, it appeared important and desirable to attach certain\r\nconditions to the permission to examine and use the soundings, if it\r\nshould be granted.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this solicitation of the cable company, certain\r\nconditions were formulated, upon which the President was willing to\r\nallow access to these soundings and to consent to the landing and\r\nlaying of the cable, subject to any alterations or additions thereto\r\nimposed by the Congress. This was deemed proper, especially as it was\r\nclear that a cable connection of some kind with China, a foreign\r\ncountry, was a part of the company's plan. This course was, moreover,\r\nin accordance with a line of precedents, including President Grant's\r\naction in the case of the first French cable, explained to the Congress\r\nin his Annual Message of December, 1875, and the instance occurring in\r\n1879 of the second French cable from Brest to St. Pierre, with a branch\r\nto Cape Cod.\r\n\r\nThese conditions prescribed, among other things, a maximum rate for\r\ncommercial messages and that the company should construct a line from\r\nthe Philippine Islands to China, there being at present, as is well\r\nknown, a British line from Manila to Hongkong.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the cable company kept these conditions long\r\nunder consideration, continuing, in the meantime, to prepare for laying\r\nthe cable. They have, however, at length acceded to them, and an\r\nall-American line between our Pacific coast and the Chinese Empire, by\r\nway of Honolulu and the Philippine Islands, is thus provided for, and\r\nis expected within a few months to be ready for business.\r\n\r\nAmong the conditions is one reserving the power of the Congress to\r\nmodify or repeal any or all of them. A copy of the conditions is\r\nherewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nOf Porto Rico it is only necessary to say that the prosperity of the\r\nisland and the wisdom with which it has been governed have been such as\r\nto make it serve as an example of all that is best in insular\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nOn July 4 last, on the one hundred and twenty-sixth anniversary of the\r\ndeclaration of our independence, peace and amnesty were promulgated in\r\nthe Philippine Islands. Some trouble has since from time to time\r\nthreatened with the Mohammedan Moros, but with the late insurrectionary\r\nFilipinos the war has entirely ceased. Civil government has now been\r\nintroduced. Not only does each Filipino enjoy such rights to life,\r\nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness as he has never before known\r\nduring the recorded history of the islands, but the people taken as a\r\nwhole now enjoy a measure of self-government greater than that granted\r\nto any other Orientals by any foreign power and greater than that\r\nenjoyed by any other Orientals under their own governments, save the\r\nJapanese alone. We have not gone too far in granting these rights of\r\nliberty and self-government; but we have certainly gone to the limit\r\nthat in the interests of the Philippine people themselves it was wise\r\nor just to go. To hurry matters, to go faster than we are now going,\r\nwould entail calamity on the people of the islands. No policy ever\r\nentered into by the American people has vindicated itself in more\r\nsignal manner than the policy of holding the Philippines. The triumph\r\nof our arms, above all the triumph of our laws and principles, has come\r\nsooner than we had any right to expect. Too much praise can not be\r\ngiven to the Army for what it has done in the Philippines both in\r\nwarfare and from an administrative standpoint in preparing the way for\r\ncivil government; and similar credit belongs to the civil authorities\r\nfor the way in which they have planted the seeds of self-government in\r\nthe ground thus made ready for them. The courage, the unflinching\r\nendurance, the high soldierly efficiency; and the general\r\nkind-heartedness and humanity of our troops have been strikingly\r\nmanifested. There now remain only some fifteen thousand troops in the\r\nislands. All told, over one hundred thousand have been sent there. Of\r\ncourse, there have been individual instances of wrongdoing among them.\r\nThey warred under fearful difficulties of climate and surroundings; and\r\nunder the strain of the terrible provocations which they continually\r\nreceived from their foes, occasional instances of cruel retaliation\r\noccurred. Every effort has been made to prevent such cruelties, and\r\nfinally these efforts have been completely successful. Every effort has\r\nalso been made to detect and punish the wrongdoers. After making all\r\nallowance for these misdeeds, it remains true that few indeed have been\r\nthe instances in which war has been waged by a civilized power against\r\nsemicivilized or barbarous forces where there has been so little\r\nwrongdoing by the victors as in the Philippine Islands. On the other\r\nhand, the amount of difficult, important, and beneficent work which has\r\nbeen done is well-nigh incalculable.\r\n\r\nTaking the work of the Army and the civil authorities together, it may\r\nbe questioned whether anywhere else in modern times the world has seen\r\na better example of real constructive statesmanship than our people\r\nhave given in the Philippine Islands. High praise should also be given\r\nthose Filipinos, in the aggregate very numerous, who have accepted the\r\nnew conditions and joined with our representatives to work with hearty\r\ngood will for the welfare of the islands.\r\n\r\nThe Army has been reduced to the minimum allowed by law. It is very\r\nsmall for the size of the Nation, and most certainly should be kept at\r\nthe highest point of efficiency. The senior officers are given scant\r\nchance under ordinary conditions to exercise commands commensurate with\r\ntheir rank, under circumstances which would fit them to do their duty\r\nin time of actual war. A system of maneuvering our Army in bodies of\r\nsome little size has been begun and should be steadily continued.\r\nWithout such maneuvers it is folly to expect that in the event of\r\nhostilities with any serious foe even a small army corps could be\r\nhandled to advantage. Both our officers and enlisted men are such that\r\nwe can take hearty pride in them. No better material can be found. But\r\nthey must be thoroughly trained, both as individuals and in the mass.\r\nThe marksmanship of the men must receive special attention. In the\r\ncircumstances of modern warfare the man must act far more on his own\r\nindividual responsibility than ever before, and the high individual\r\nefficiency of the unit is of the utmost importance. Formerly this unit\r\nwas the regiment; it is now not the regiment, not even the troop or\r\ncompany; it is the individual soldier. Every effort must be made to\r\ndevelop every workmanlike and soldierly quality in both the officer and\r\nthe enlisted man.\r\n\r\nI urgently call your attention to the need of passing a bill providing\r\nfor a general staff and for the reorganization of the supply\r\ndepartments on the lines of the bill proposed by the Secretary of War\r\nlast year. When the young officers enter the Army from West Point they\r\nprobably stand above their compeers in any other military service.\r\nEvery effort should be made, by training, by reward of merit, by\r\nscrutiny into their careers and capacity, to keep them of the same high\r\nrelative excellence throughout their careers.\r\n\r\nThe measure providing for the reorganization of the militia system and\r\nfor securing the highest efficiency in the National Guard, which has\r\nalready passed the House, should receive prompt attention and action.\r\nIt is of great importance that the relation of the National Guard to\r\nthe militia and volunteer forces of the United States should be\r\ndefined, and that in place of our present obsolete laws a practical and\r\nefficient system should be adopted.\r\n\r\nProvision should be made to enable the Secretary of War to keep cavalry\r\nand artillery horses, worn-out in long performance of duty. Such horses\r\nfetch but a trifle when sold; and rather than turn them out to the\r\nmisery awaiting them when thus disposed of, it would be better to\r\nemploy them at light work around the posts, and when necessary to put\r\nthem painlessly to death.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in our history naval maneuvers on a large scale are\r\nbeing held under the immediate command of the Admiral of the Navy.\r\nConstantly increasing attention is being paid to the gunnery of the\r\nNavy, but it is yet far from what it should be. I earnestly urge that\r\nthe increase asked for by the Secretary of the Navy in the\r\nappropriation for improving the markmanship be granted. In battle the\r\nonly shots that count are the shots that hit. It is necessary to\r\nprovide ample funds for practice with the great guns in time of peace.\r\nThese funds must provide not only for the purchase of projectiles, but\r\nfor allowances for prizes to encourage the gun crews, and especially\r\nthe gun pointers, and for perfecting an intelligent system under which\r\nalone it is possible to get good practice.\r\n\r\nThere should be no halt in the work of building up the Navy, providing\r\nevery year additional fighting craft. We are a very rich country, vast\r\nin extent of territory and great in population; a country, moreover,\r\nwhich has an Army diminutive indeed when compared with that of any\r\nother first-class power. We have deliberately made our own certain\r\nforeign policies which demand the possession of a first-class navy. The\r\nisthmian canal will greatly increase the efficiency of our Navy if the\r\nNavy is of sufficient size; but if we have an inadequate navy, then the\r\nbuilding of the canal would be merely giving a hostage to any power of\r\nsuperior strength. The Monroe Doctrine should be treated as the\r\ncardinal feature of American foreign policy; but it would be worse than\r\nidle to assert it unless we intended to back it up, and it can be\r\nbacked up only by a thoroughly good navy. A good navy is not a\r\nprovocative of war. It is the surest guaranty of peace.\r\n\r\nEach individual unit of our Navy should be the most efficient of its\r\nkind as regards both material and personnel that is to be found in the\r\nworld. I call your special attention to the need of providing for the\r\nmanning of the ships. Serious trouble threatens us if we can not do\r\nbetter than we are now doing as regards securing the services of a\r\nsufficient number of the highest type of sailormen, of sea mechanics.\r\nThe veteran seamen of our war ships are of as high a type as can be\r\nfound in any navy which rides the waters of the world; they are\r\nunsurpassed in daring, in resolution, in readiness, in thorough\r\nknowledge of their profession. They deserve every consideration that\r\ncan be shown them. But there are not enough of them. It is no more\r\npossible to improvise a crew than it is possible to improvise a war\r\nship. To build the finest ship, with the deadliest battery, and to send\r\nit afloat with a raw crew, no matter how brave they were individually,\r\nwould be to insure disaster if a foe of average capacity were\r\nencountered. Neither ships nor men can be improvised when war has\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nWe need a thousand additional officers in order to properly man the\r\nships now provided for and under construction. The classes at the Naval\r\nSchool at Annapolis should be greatly enlarged. At the same time that\r\nwe thus add the officers where we need them, we should facilitate the\r\nretirement of those at the head of the list whose usefulness has become\r\nimpaired. Promotion must be fostered if the service is to be kept\r\nefficient.\r\n\r\nThe lamentable scarcity of officers, and the large number of recruits\r\nand of unskilled men necessarily put aboard the new vessels as they\r\nhave been commissioned, has thrown upon our officers, and especially on\r\nthe lieutenants and junior grades, unusual labor and fatigue and has\r\ngravely strained their powers of endurance. Nor is there sign of any\r\nimmediate let-up in this strain. It must continue for some time longer,\r\nuntil more officers are graduated from Annapolis, and until the\r\nrecruits become trained and skillful in their duties. In these\r\ndifficulties incident upon the development of our war fleet the conduct\r\nof all our officers has been creditable to the service, and the\r\nlieutenants and junior grades in particular have displayed an ability\r\nand a steadfast cheerfulness which entitles them to the ungrudging\r\nthanks of all who realize the disheartening trials and fatigues to\r\nwhich they are of necessity subjected.\r\n\r\nThere is not a cloud on the horizon at present. There seems not the\r\nslightest chance of trouble with a foreign power. We most earnestly\r\nhope that this state of things may continue; and the way to insure its\r\ncontinuance is to provide for a thoroughly efficient navy. The refusal\r\nto maintain such a navy would invite trouble, and if trouble came would\r\ninsure disaster. Fatuous self-complacency or vanity, or\r\nshort-sightedness in refusing to prepare for danger, is both foolish\r\nand wicked in such a nation as ours; and past experience has shown that\r\nsuch fatuity in refusing to recognize or prepare for any crisis in\r\nadvance is usually succeeded by a mad panic of hysterical fear once the\r\ncrisis has actually arrived.\r\n\r\nThe striking increase in the revenues of the Post-Office Department\r\nshows clearly the prosperity of our people and the increasing activity\r\nof the business of the country.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of the Post-Office Department for the fiscal year ending\r\nJune 30 last amounted to $121,848,047.26, an increase of $10,216,853.87\r\nover the preceding year, the largest increase known in the history of\r\nthe postal service. The magnitude of this increase will best appear\r\nfrom the fact that the entire postal receipts for the year 1860\r\namounted to but $8,518,067.\r\n\r\nRural free-delivery service is no longer in the experimental stage; it\r\nhas become a fixed policy. The results following its introduction have\r\nfully justified the Congress in the large appropriations made for its\r\nestablishment and extension. The average yearly increase in post-office\r\nreceipts in the rural districts of the country is about two per cent.\r\nWe are now able, by actual results, to show that where rural\r\nfree-delivery service has been established to such an extent as to\r\nenable us to make comparisons the yearly increase has been upward of\r\nten per cent.\r\n\r\nOn November 1, 1902, 11,650 rural free-delivery routes had been\r\nestablished and were in operation, covering about one-third of the\r\nterritory of the United States available for rural free-delivery\r\nservice. There are now awaiting the action of the Department petitions\r\nand applications for the establishment of 10,748 additional routes.\r\nThis shows conclusively the want which the establishment of the service\r\nhas met and the need of further extending it as rapidly as possible. It\r\nis justified both by the financial results and by the practical\r\nbenefits to our rural population; it brings the men who live on the\r\nsoil into close relations with the active business world; it keeps the\r\nfarmer in daily touch with the markets; it is a potential educational\r\nforce; it enhances the value of farm property, makes farm life far\r\npleasanter and less isolated, and will do much to check the undesirable\r\ncurrent from country to city.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that the Congress will make liberal appropriations\r\nfor the continuance of the service already established and for its\r\nfurther extension.\r\n\r\nFew subjects of more importance have been taken up by the Congress in\r\nrecent years than the inauguration of the system of nationally-aided\r\nirrigation for the arid regions of the far West. A good beginning\r\ntherein has been made. Now that this policy of national irrigation has\r\nbeen adopted, the need of thorough and scientific forest protection\r\nwill grow more rapidly than ever throughout the public-land States.\r\n\r\nLegislation should be provided for the protection of the game, and the\r\nwild creatures generally, on the forest reserves. The senseless\r\nslaughter of game, which can by judicious protection be permanently\r\npreserved on our national reserves for the people as a whole, should be\r\nstopped at once. It is, for instance, a serious count against our\r\nnational good sense to permit the present practice of butchering off\r\nsuch a stately and beautiful creature as the elk for its antlers or\r\ntusks.\r\n\r\nSo far as they are available for agriculture, and to whatever extent\r\nthey may be reclaimed under the national irrigation law, the remaining\r\npublic lands should be held rigidly for the home builder, the settler\r\nwho lives on his land, and for no one else. In their actual use the\r\ndesert-land law, the timber and stone law, and the commutation clause\r\nof the homestead law have been so perverted from the intention with\r\nwhich they were enacted as to permit the acquisition of large areas of\r\nthe public domain for other than actual settlers and the consequent\r\nprevention of settlement. Moreover, the approaching exhaustion of the\r\npublic ranges has of late led to much discussion as to the best manner\r\nof using these public lands in the West which are suitable chiefly or\r\nonly for grazing. The sound and steady development of the West depends\r\nupon the building up of homes therein. Much of our prosperity as a\r\nnation has been due to the operation of the homestead law. On the other\r\nhand, we should recognize the fact that in the grazing region the man\r\nwho corresponds to the homesteader may be unable to settle permanently\r\nif only allowed to use the same amount of pasture land that his\r\nbrother, the homesteader, is allowed to use of arable land. One hundred\r\nand sixty acres of fairly rich and well-watered soil, or a much smaller\r\namount of irrigated land, may keep a family in plenty, whereas no one\r\ncould get a living from one hundred and sixty acres of dry pasture land\r\ncapable of supporting at the outside only one head of cattle to every\r\nten acres. In the past great tracts of the public domain have been\r\nfenced in by persons having no title thereto, in direct defiance of the\r\nlaw forbidding the maintenance or construction of any such unlawful\r\ninclosure of public land. For various reasons there has been little\r\ninterference with such inclosures in the past, but ample notice has now\r\nbeen given the trespassers, and all the resources at the command of the\r\nGovernment will hereafter be used to put a stop to such trespassing.\r\n\r\nIn view of the capital importance of these matters, I commend them to\r\nthe earnest consideration of the Congress, and if the Congress finds\r\ndifficulty in dealing with them from lack of thorough knowledge of the\r\nsubject, I recommend that provision be made for a commission of experts\r\nspecially to investigate and report upon the complicated questions\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nI especially urge upon the Congress the need of wise legislation for\r\nAlaska. It is not to our credit as a nation that Alaska, which has been\r\nours for thirty-five years, should still have as poor a system Of laws\r\nas is the case. No country has a more valuable possession--in mineral\r\nwealth, in fisheries, furs, forests, and also in land available for\r\ncertain kinds of farming and stockgrowing. It is a territory of great\r\nsize and varied resources, well fitted to support a large permanent\r\npopulation. Alaska needs a good land law and such provisions for\r\nhomesteads and pre-emptions as will encourage permanent settlement. We\r\nshould shape legislation with a view not to the exploiting and\r\nabandoning of the territory, but to the building up of homes therein.\r\nThe land laws should be liberal in type, so as to hold out inducements\r\nto the actual settler whom we most desire to see take possession of the\r\ncountry. The forests of Alaska should be protected, and, as a secondary\r\nbut still important matter, the game also, and at the same time it is\r\nimperative that the settlers should be allowed to cut timber, under\r\nproper regulations, for their own use. Laws should be enacted to\r\nprotect the Alaskan salmon fisheries against the greed which would\r\ndestroy them. They should be preserved as a permanent industry and food\r\nsupply. Their management and control should be turned over to the\r\nCommission of Fish and Fisheries. Alaska should have a Delegate in the\r\nCongress. It would be well if a Congressional committee could visit\r\nAlaska and investigate its needs on the ground.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the Indians our aim should be their ultimate absorption\r\ninto the body of our people. But in many cases this absorption must and\r\nshould be very slow. In portions of the Indian Territory the mixture of\r\nblood has gone on at the same time with progress in wealth and\r\neducation, so that there are plenty of men with varying degrees of\r\npurity of Indian blood who are absolutely indistinguishable in point of\r\nsocial, political, and economic ability from their white associates.\r\nThere are other tribes which have as yet made no perceptible advance\r\ntoward such equality. To try to force such tribes too fast is to\r\nprevent their going forward at all. Moreover, the tribes live under\r\nwidely different conditions. Where a tribe has made considerable\r\nadvance and lives on fertile farming soil it is possible to allot the\r\nmembers lands in severalty much as is the case with white settlers.\r\nThere are other tribes where such a course is not desirable. On the\r\narid prairie lands the effort should be to induce the Indians to lead\r\npastoral rather than agricultural lives, and to permit them to settle\r\nin villages rather than to force them into isolation.\r\n\r\nThe large Indian schools situated remote from any Indian reservation do\r\na special and peculiar work of great importance. But, excellent though\r\nthese are, an immense amount of additional work must be done on the\r\nreservations themselves among the old, and above all among the young,\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nThe first and most important step toward the absorption of the Indian\r\nis to teach him to earn his living; yet it is not necessarily to be\r\nassumed that in each community all Indians must become either tillers\r\nof the soil or stock raisers. Their industries may properly be\r\ndiversified, and those who show special desire or adaptability for\r\nindustrial or even commercial pursuits should be encouraged so far as\r\npracticable to follow out each his own bent.\r\n\r\nEvery effort should be made to develop the Indian along the lines of\r\nnatural aptitude, and to encourage the existing native industries\r\npeculiar to certain tribes, such as the various kinds of basket\r\nweaving, canoe building, smith work, and blanket work. Above all, the\r\nIndian boys and girls should be given confident command of colloquial\r\nEnglish, and should ordinarily be prepared for a vigorous struggle with\r\nthe conditions under which their people live, rather than for immediate\r\nabsorption into some more highly developed community.\r\n\r\nThe officials who represent the Government in dealing with the Indians\r\nwork under hard conditions, and also under conditions which render it\r\neasy to do wrong and very difficult to detect wrong. Consequently they\r\nshould be amply paid on the one hand, and on the other hand a\r\nparticularly high standard of conduct should be demanded from them, and\r\nwhere misconduct can be proved the punishment should be exemplary.\r\n\r\nIn no department of governmental work in recent years has there been\r\ngreater success than in that of giving scientific aid to the farming\r\npopulation, thereby showing them how most efficiently to help\r\nthemselves. There is no need of insisting upon its importance, for the\r\nwelfare of the farmer is fundamentally necessary to the welfare of the\r\nRepublic as a whole. In addition to such work as quarantine against\r\nanimal and vegetable plagues, and warring against them when here\r\nintroduced, much efficient help has been rendered to the farmer by the\r\nintroduction of new plants specially fitted for cultivation under the\r\npeculiar conditions existing in different portions of the country. New\r\ncereals have been established in the semi-arid West. For instance, the\r\npracticability of producing the best types of macaroni wheats in\r\nregions of an annual rainfall of only ten inches or thereabouts has\r\nbeen conclusively demonstrated. Through the introduction of new rices\r\nin Louisiana and Texas the production of rice in this country has been\r\nmade to about equal the home demand. In the South-west the possibility\r\nof regrassing overstocked range lands has been demonstrated; in the\r\nNorth many new forage crops have been introduced, while in the East it\r\nhas been shown that some of our choicest fruits can be stored and\r\nshipped in such a way as to find a profitable market abroad.\r\n\r\nI again recommend to the favorable consideration of the Congress the\r\nplans of the Smithsonian Institution for making the Museum under its\r\ncharge worthy of the Nation, and for preserving at the National Capital\r\nnot only records of the vanishing races of men but of the animals of\r\nthis continent which, like the buffalo, will soon become extinct unless\r\nspecimens from which their representatives may be renewed are sought in\r\ntheir native regions and maintained there in safety.\r\n\r\nThe District of Columbia is the only part of our territory in which the\r\nNational Government exercises local or municipal functions, and where\r\nin consequence the Government has a free hand in reference to certain\r\ntypes of social and economic legislation which must be essentially\r\nlocal or municipal in their character. The Government should see to it,\r\nfor instance, that the hygienic and sanitary legislation affecting\r\nWashington is of a high character. The evils of slum dwellings, whether\r\nin the shape of crowded and congested tenement-house districts or of\r\nthe back-alley type, should never be permitted to grow up in\r\nWashington. The city should be a model in every respect for all the\r\ncities of the country. The charitable and correctional systems of the\r\nDistrict should receive consideration at the hands of the Congress to\r\nthe end that they may embody the results of the most advanced thought\r\nin these fields. Moreover, while Washington is not a great industrial\r\ncity, there is some industrialism here, and our labor legislation,\r\nwhile it would not be important in itself, might be made a model for\r\nthe rest of the Nation. We should pass, for instance, a wise\r\nemployer's-liability act for the District of Columbia, and we need such\r\nan act in our navy-yards. Railroad companies in the District ought to\r\nbe required by law to block their frogs.\r\n\r\nThe safety-appliance law, for the better protection of the lives and\r\nlimbs of railway employees, which was passed in 1893, went into full\r\neffect on August 1, 1901. It has resulted in averting thousands of\r\ncasualties. Experience shows, however, the necessity of additional\r\nlegislation to perfect this law. A bill to provide for this passed the\r\nSenate at the last session. It is to be hoped that some such measure\r\nmay now be enacted into law.\r\n\r\nThere is a growing tendency to provide for the publication of masses of\r\ndocuments for which there is no public demand and for the printing of\r\nwhich there is no real necessity. Large numbers of volumes are turned\r\nout by the Government printing presses for which there is no\r\njustification. Nothing should be printed by any of the Departments\r\nunless it contains something of permanent value, and the Congress could\r\nwith advantage cut down very materially on all the printing which it\r\nhas now become customary to provide. The excessive cost of Government\r\nprinting is a strong argument against the position of those who are\r\ninclined on abstract grounds to advocate the Government's doing any\r\nwork which can with propriety be left in private hands.\r\n\r\nGratifying progress has been made during the year in the extension of\r\nthe merit system of making appointments in the Government service. It\r\nshould be extended by law to the District of Columbia. It is much to be\r\ndesired that our consular system be established by law on a basis\r\nproviding for appointment and promotion only in consequence of proved\r\nfitness.\r\n\r\nThrough a wise provision of the Congress at its last session the White\r\nHouse, which had become disfigured by incongruous additions and\r\nchanges, has now been restored to what it was planned to be by\r\nWashington. In making the restorations the utmost care has been\r\nexercised to come as near as possible to the early plans and to\r\nsupplement these plans by a careful study of such buildings as that of\r\nthe University of Virginia, which was built by Jefferson. The White\r\nHouse is the property of the Nation, and so far as is compatible with\r\nliving therein it should be kept as it originally was, for the same\r\nreasons that we keep Mount Vernon as it originally was. The stately\r\nsimplicity of its architecture is an expression of the character of the\r\nperiod in which it was built, and is in accord with the purposes it was\r\ndesigned to serve. It is a good thing to preserve such buildings as\r\nhistoric monuments which keep alive our sense of continuity with the\r\nNation's past.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the several Executive Departments are submitted to the\r\nCongress with this communication.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nTheodore Roosevelt\r\nDecember 7, 1903\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe country is to be congratulated on the amount of substantial\r\nachievement which has marked the past year both as regards our foreign\r\nand as regards our domestic policy.\r\n\r\nWith a nation as with a man the most important things are those of the\r\nhousehold, and therefore the country is especially to be congratulated\r\non what has been accomplished in the direction of providing for the\r\nexercise of supervision over the great corporations and combinations of\r\ncorporations engaged in interstate commerce. The Congress has created\r\nthe Department of Commerce and Labor, including the Bureau of\r\nCorporations, with for the first time authority to secure proper\r\npublicity of such proceedings of these great corporations as the public\r\nhas the right to know. It has provided for the expediting of suits for\r\nthe enforcement of the Federal anti-trust law; and by another law it\r\nhas secured equal treatment to all producers in the transportation of\r\ntheir goods, thus taking a long stride forward in making effective the\r\nwork of the Interstate Commerce Commission.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the Department of Commerce and Labor, with the\r\nBureau of Corporations thereunder, marks a real advance in the\r\ndirection of doing all that is possible for the solution of the\r\nquestions vitally affecting capitalists and wage-workers. The act\r\ncreating Department was approved on February 14, 1903, and two days\r\nlater the head of the Department was nominated and confirmed by the\r\nSenate. Since then the work of organization has been pushed as rapidly\r\nas the initial appropriations permitted, and with due regard to\r\nthoroughness and the broad purposes which the Department is designed to\r\nserve. After the transfer of the various bureaus and branches to the\r\nDepartment at the beginning of the current fiscal year, as provided for\r\nin the act, the personnel comprised 1,289 employees in Washington and\r\n8,836 in the country at large. The scope of the Department's duty and\r\nauthority embraces the commercial and industrial interests of the\r\nNation. It is not designed to restrict or control the fullest liberty\r\nof legitimate business action, but to secure exact and authentic\r\ninformation which will aid the Executive in enforcing existing laws,\r\nand which will enable the Congress to enact additional legislation, if\r\nany should be found necessary, in order to prevent the few from\r\nobtaining privileges at the expense of diminished opportunities for the\r\nmany.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary work of the Bureau of Corporations in the Department\r\nhas shown the wisdom of its creation. Publicity in corporate affairs\r\nwill tend to do away with ignorance, and will afford facts upon which\r\nintelligent action may be taken. Systematic, intelligent investigation\r\nis already developing facts the knowledge of which is essential to a\r\nright understanding of the needs and duties of the business world. The\r\ncorporation which is honestly and fairly organized, whose managers in\r\nthe conduct of its business recognize their obligation to deal squarely\r\nwith their stockholders, their competitors, and the public, has nothing\r\nto fear from such supervision. The purpose of this Bureau is not to\r\nembarrass or assail legitimate business, but to aid in bringing about a\r\nbetter industrial condition--a condition under which there shall be\r\nobedience to law and recognition of public obligation by all\r\ncorporations, great or small. The Department of Commerce and Labor will\r\nbe not only the clearing house for information regarding the business\r\ntransactions of the Nation, but the executive arm of the Government to\r\naid in strengthening our domestic and foreign markets, in perfecting\r\nour transportation facilities, in building up our merchant marine, in\r\npreventing the entrance of undesirable immigrants, in improving\r\ncommercial and industrial conditions, and in bringing together on\r\ncommon ground those necessary partners in industrial progress--capital\r\nand labor. Commerce between the nations is steadily growing in volume,\r\nand the tendency of the times is toward closer trade relations.\r\nConstant watchfulness is needed to secure to Americans the chance to\r\nparticipate to the best advantage in foreign trade; and we may\r\nconfidently expect that the new Department will justify the expectation\r\nof its creators by the exercise of this watchfulness, as well as by the\r\nbusinesslike administration of such laws relating to our internal\r\naffairs as are intrusted to its care.\r\n\r\nIn enacting the laws above enumerated the Congress proceeded on sane\r\nand conservative lines. Nothing revolutionary was attempted; but a\r\ncommon-sense and successful effort was made in the direction of seeing\r\nthat corporations are so handled as to subserve the public good. The\r\nlegislation was moderate. It was characterized throughout by the idea\r\nthat we were not attacking corporations, but endeavoring to provide for\r\ndoing away with any evil in them; that we drew the line against\r\nmisconduct, not against wealth; gladly recognizing the great good done\r\nby the capitalist who alone, or in conjunction with his fellows, does\r\nhis work along proper and legitimate lines. The purpose of the\r\nlegislation, which purpose will undoubtedly be fulfilled, was to favor\r\nsuch a man when he does well, and to supervise his action only to\r\nprevent him from doing ill. Publicity can do no harm to the honest\r\ncorporation. The only corporation that has cause to dread it is the\r\ncorporation which shrinks from the light, and about the welfare of such\r\ncorporations we need not be oversensitive. The work of the Department\r\nof Commerce and Labor has been conditioned upon this theory, of\r\nsecuring fair treatment alike for labor and for capital.\r\n\r\nThe consistent policy of the National Government, so far as it has the\r\npower, is to hold in check the unscrupulous man, whether employer or\r\nemployee; but to refuse to weaken individual initiative or to hamper or\r\ncramp the industrial development of the country. We recognize that this\r\nis an era of federation and combination, in which great capitalistic\r\ncorporations and labor unions have become factors of tremendous\r\nimportance in all industrial centers. Hearty recognition is given the\r\nfar-reaching, beneficent work which has been accomplished through both\r\ncorporations and unions, and the line as between different\r\ncorporations, as between different unions, is drawn as it is between\r\ndifferent individuals; that is, it is drawn on conduct, the effort\r\nbeing to treat both organized capital and organized labor alike; asking\r\nnothing save that the interest of each shall be brought into harmony\r\nwith the interest of the general public, and that the conduct of each\r\nshall conform to the fundamental rules of obedience to law, of\r\nindividual freedom, and of justice and fair dealing towards all.\r\nWhenever either corporation, labor union, or individual disregards the\r\nlaw or acts in a spirit of arbitrary and tyrannous interference with\r\nthe rights of others, whether corporations or individuals, then where\r\nthe Federal Government has jurisdiction, it will see to it that the\r\nmisconduct is stopped, paying not the slightest heed to the position or\r\npower of the corporation, the union or the individual, but only to one\r\nvital fact--that is, the question whether or not the conduct of the\r\nindividual or aggregate of individuals is in accordance with the law of\r\nthe land. Every man must be guaranteed his liberty and his right to do\r\nas he likes with his property or his labor, so long as he does not\r\ninfringe the rights of others. No man is above the law and no man is\r\nbelow it; nor do we ask any man's permission when we require him to\r\nobey it. Obedience to the law is demanded as a right; not asked as a\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\nWe have cause as a nation to be thankful for the steps that have been\r\nso successfully taken to put these principles into effect. The progress\r\nhas been by evolution, not by revolution. Nothing radical has been\r\ndone; the action has been both moderate and resolute. Therefore the\r\nwork will stand. There shall be no backward step. If in the working of\r\nthe laws it proves desirable that they shall at any point be expanded\r\nor amplified, the amendment can be made as its desirability is shown.\r\nMeanwhile they are being administered with judgment, but with\r\ninsistence upon obedience to them, and their need has been emphasized\r\nin signal fashion by the events of the past year.\r\n\r\nFrom all sources, exclusive of the postal service, the receipts of the\r\nGovernment for the last fiscal year aggregated $560,396,674. The\r\nexpenditures for the same period were $506,099,007, the surplus for the\r\nfiscal year being $54,297,667. The indications are that the surplus for\r\nthe present fiscal year will be very small, if indeed there be any\r\nsurplus. From July to November the receipts from customs were,\r\napproximately, nine million dollars less than the receipts from the\r\nsame source for a corresponding portion of last year. Should this\r\ndecrease continue at the same ratio throughout the fiscal year, the\r\nsurplus would be reduced by, approximately, thirty million dollars.\r\nShould the revenue from customs suffer much further decrease during the\r\nfiscal year, the surplus would vanish. A large surplus is certainly\r\nundesirable. Two years ago the war taxes were taken off with the\r\nexpress intention of equalizing the governmental receipts and\r\nexpenditures, and though the first year thereafter still showed a\r\nsurplus, it now seems likely that a substantial equality of revenue and\r\nexpenditure will be attained. Such being the case it is of great moment\r\nboth to exercise care and economy in appropriations, and to scan\r\nsharply any change in our fiscal revenue system which may reduce our\r\nincome. The need of strict economy in our expenditures is emphasized by\r\nthe fact that we can not afford to be parsimonious in providing for\r\nwhat is essential to our national well-being. Careful economy wherever\r\npossible will alone prevent our income from falling below the point\r\nrequired in order to meet our genuine needs.\r\n\r\nThe integrity of our currency is beyond question, and under present\r\nconditions it would be unwise and unnecessary to attempt a\r\nreconstruction of our entire monetary system. The same liberty should\r\nbe granted the Secretary of the Treasury to deposit customs receipts as\r\nis granted him in the deposit of receipts from other sources. In my\r\nMessage of December 2, 1902, I called attention to certain needs of the\r\nfinancial situation, and I again ask the consideration of the Congress\r\nfor these questions.\r\n\r\nDuring the last session of the Congress at the suggestion of a joint\r\nnote from the Republic of Mexico and the Imperial Government of China,\r\nand in harmony with an act of the Congress appropriating $25,000 to pay\r\nthe expenses thereof, a commission was appointed to confer with the\r\nprincipal European countries in the hope that some plan might be\r\ndevised whereby a fixed rate of exchange could be assured between the\r\ngold-standard countries and the silver-standard countries. This\r\ncommission has filed its preliminary report, which has been made\r\npublic. I deem it important that the commission be continued, and that\r\na sum of money be appropriated sufficient to pay the expenses of its\r\nfurther labors.\r\n\r\nA majority of our people desire that steps be taken in the interests of\r\nAmerican shipping, so that we may once more resume our former position\r\nin the ocean carrying trade. But hitherto the differences of opinion as\r\nto the proper method of reaching this end have been so wide that it has\r\nproved impossible to secure the adoption of any particular scheme.\r\nHaving in view these facts, I recommend that the Congress direct the\r\nSecretary of the Navy, the Postmaster-General, and the Secretary of\r\nCommerce and Labor, associated with such a representation from the\r\nSenate and House of Representatives as the Congress in its wisdom may\r\ndesignate, to serve as a commission for the purpose of investigating\r\nand reporting to the Congress at its next session what legislation is\r\ndesirable or necessary for the development of the American merchant\r\nmarine and American commerce, and incidentally of a national ocean mail\r\nservice of adequate auxiliary naval crusiers and naval reserves. While\r\nsuch a measure is desirable in any event, it is especially desirable at\r\nthis time, in view of the fact that our present governmental contract\r\nfor ocean mail with the American Line will expire in 1905. Our ocean\r\nmail act was passed in 1891. In 1895 our 20-knot transatlantic mail\r\nline was equal to any foreign line. Since then the Germans have put on\r\n23-knot, steamers, and the British have contracted for 24-knot\r\nsteamers. Our service should equal the best. If it does not, the\r\ncommercial public will abandon it. If we are to stay in the business it\r\nought to be with a full understanding of the advantages to the country\r\non one hand, and on the other with exact knowledge of the cost and\r\nproper methods of carrying it on. Moreover, lines of cargo ships are of\r\neven more importance than fast mail lines; save so far as the latter\r\ncan be depended upon to furnish swift auxiliary cruisers in time of\r\nwar. The establishment of new lines of cargo ships to South America, to\r\nAsia, and elsewhere would be much in the interest of our commercial\r\nexpansion.\r\n\r\nWe can not have too much immigration of the right kind, and we should\r\nhave none at all of the wrong kind. The need is to devise some system\r\nby which undesirable immigrants shall be kept out entirely, while\r\ndesirable immigrants are properly distributed throughout the country.\r\nAt present some districts which need immigrants have none; and in\r\nothers, where the population is already congested, immigrants come in\r\nsuch numbers as to depress the conditions of life for those already\r\nthere. During the last two years the immigration service at New York\r\nhas been greatly improved, and the corruption and inefficiency which\r\nformerly obtained there have been eradicated. This service has just\r\nbeen investigated by a committee of New York citizens of high standing,\r\nMessrs. Arthur V. Briesen, Lee K. Frankel, Eugene A. Philbin, Thomas W.\r\nHynes, and Ralph Trautman. Their report deals with the whole situation\r\nat length, and concludes with certain recommendations for\r\nadministrative and legislative action. It is now receiving the\r\nattention of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor.\r\n\r\nThe special investigation of the subject of naturalization under the\r\ndirection of the Attorney-General, and the consequent prosecutions\r\nreveal a condition of affairs calling for the immediate attention of\r\nthe Congress. Forgeries and perjuries of shameless and flagrant\r\ncharacter have been perpetrated, not only in the dense centers of\r\npopulation, but throughout the country; and it is established beyond\r\ndoubt that very many so-called citizens of the United States have no\r\ntitle whatever to that right, and are asserting and enjoying the\r\nbenefits of the same through the grossest frauds. It is never to be\r\nforgotten that citizenship is, to quote the words recently used by the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, an \"inestimable heritage,\" whether\r\nit proceeds from birth within the country or is obtained by\r\nnaturalization; and we poison the sources of our national character and\r\nstrength at the fountain, if the privilege is claimed and exercised\r\nwithout right, and by means of fraud and corruption. The body politic\r\ncan not be sound and healthy if many of its constituent members claim\r\ntheir standing through the prostitution of the high right and calling\r\nof citizenship. It should mean something to become a citizen of the\r\nUnited States; and in the process no loophole whatever should be left\r\nopen to fraud.\r\n\r\nThe methods by which these frauds--now under full investigation with a\r\nview to meting out punishment and providing adequate remedies--are\r\nperpetrated, include many variations of procedure by which false\r\ncertificates of citizenship are forged in their entirety; or genuine\r\ncertificates fraudulently or collusively obtained in blank are filled\r\nin by the criminal conspirators; or certificates are obtained on\r\nfraudulent statements as to the time of arrival and residence in this\r\ncountry; or imposition and substitution of another party for the real\r\npetitioner occur in court; or certificates are made the subject of\r\nbarter and sale and transferred from the rightful holder to those not\r\nentitled to them; or certificates are forged by erasure of the original\r\nnames and the insertion of the names of other persons not entitled to\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary for me to refer here at large to the causes leading\r\nto this state of affairs. The desire for naturalization is heartily to\r\nbe commended where it springs from a sincere and permanent intention to\r\nbecome citizens, and a real appreciation of the privilege. But it is a\r\nsource of untold evil and trouble where it is traceable to selfish and\r\ndishonest motives, such as the effort by artificial and improper means,\r\nin wholesale fashion to create voters who are ready-made tools of\r\ncorrupt politicians, or the desire to evade certain labor laws creating\r\ndiscriminations against alien labor. All good citizens, whether\r\nnaturalized or native born, are equally interested in protecting our\r\ncitizenship against fraud in any form, and, on the other hand, in\r\naffording every facility for naturalization to those who in good faith\r\ndesire to share alike our privileges and our responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThe Federal grand jury lately in session in New York City dealt with\r\nthis subject and made a presentment which states the situation briefly\r\nand forcibly and contains important suggestions for the consideration\r\nof the Congress. This presentment is included as an appendix to the\r\nreport of the Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual Message, in connection with the subject of the due\r\nregulation of combinations of capital which are or may become injurious\r\nto the public, I recommend a special appropriation for the better\r\nenforcement of the antitrust law as it now stands, to be extended under\r\nthe direction of the Attorney-General. Accordingly (by the legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judicial appropriation act of February 25, 1903, 32\r\nStat., 854, 904), the Congress appropriated, for the purpose of\r\nenforcing the various Federal trust and interstate-commerce laws, the\r\nsum of five hundred thousand dollars, to be expended under the\r\ndirection of the Attorney-General in the employment of special counsel\r\nand agents in the Department of Justice to conduct proceedings and\r\nprosecutions under said laws in the courts of the United States. I now\r\nrecommend, as a matter of the utmost importance and urgency, the\r\nextension of the purposes of this appropriation, so that it may be\r\navailable, under the direction of the Attorney-General, and until used,\r\nfor the due enforcement of the laws of the United States in general and\r\nespecially of the civil and criminal laws relating to public lands and\r\nthe laws relating to postal crimes and offenses and the subject of\r\nnaturalization. Recent investigations have shown a deplorable state of\r\naffairs in these three matters of vital concern. By various frauds and\r\nby forgeries and perjuries, thousands of acres of the public domain,\r\nembracing lands of different character and extending through various\r\nsections of the country, have been dishonestly acquired. It is hardly\r\nnecessary to urge the importance of recovering these dishonest\r\nacquisitions, stolen from the people, and of promptly and duly\r\npunishing the offenders. I speak in another part of this Message of the\r\nwidespread crimes by which the sacred right of citizenship is falsely\r\nasserted and that \"inestimable heritage\" perverted to base ends. By\r\nsimilar means--that is, through frauds, forgeries, and perjuries, and\r\nby shameless briberies--the laws relating to the proper conduct of the\r\npublic service in general and to the due administration of the\r\nPost-Office Department have been notoriously violated, and many\r\nindictments have been found, and the consequent prosecutions are in\r\ncourse of hearing or on the eve thereof. For the reasons thus\r\nindicated, and so that the Government may be prepared to enforce\r\npromptly and with the greatest effect the due penalties for such\r\nviolations of law, and to this end may be furnished with sufficient\r\ninstrumentalities and competent legal assistance for the investigations\r\nand trials which will be necessary at many different points of the\r\ncountry, I urge upon the Congress the necessity of making the said\r\nappropriation available for immediate use for all such purposes, to be\r\nexpended under the direction of the Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nSteps have been taken by the State Department looking to the making of\r\nbribery an extraditable offense with foreign powers. The need of more\r\neffective treaties covering this crime is manifest. The exposures and\r\nprosecutions of official corruption in St. Louis, Mo., and other cities\r\nand States have resulted in a number of givers and takers of bribes\r\nbecoming fugitives in foreign lands. Bribery has not been included in\r\nextradition treaties heretofore, as the necessity for it has not\r\narisen. While there may have been as much official corruption in former\r\nyears, there has been more developed and brought to light in the\r\nimmediate past than in the preceding century of our country's history.\r\nIt should be the policy of the United States to leave no place on earth\r\nwhere a corrupt man fleeing from this country can rest in peace. There\r\nis no reason why bribery should not be included in all treaties as\r\nextraditable. The recent amended treaty with Mexico, whereby this crime\r\nwas put in the list of extraditable offenses, has established a\r\nsalutary precedent in this regard. Under this treaty the State\r\nDepartment has asked, and Mexico has granted, the extradition of one of\r\nthe St. Louis bribe givers.\r\n\r\nThere can be no crime more serious than bribery. Other offenses violate\r\none law while corruption strikes at the foundation of all law. Under\r\nour form of Government all authority is vested in the people and by\r\nthem delegated to those who represent them in official capacity. There\r\ncan be no offense heavier than that of him in whom such a sacred trust\r\nhas been reposed, who sells it for his own gain and enrichment; and no\r\nless heavy is the offense of the bribe giver. He is worse than the\r\nthief, for the thief robs the individual, while the corrupt official\r\nplunders an entire city or State. He is as wicked as the murderer, for\r\nthe murderer may only take one life against the law, while the corrupt\r\nofficial and the man who corrupts the official alike aim at the\r\nassassination of the commonwealth itself. Government of the people, by\r\nthe people, for the people will perish from the face of the earth if\r\nbribery is tolerated. The givers and takers of bribes stand on an evil\r\npre-eminence of infamy. The exposure and punishment of public\r\ncorruption is an honor to a nation, not a disgrace. The shame lies in\r\ntoleration, not in correction. No city or State, still less the Nation,\r\ncan be injured by the enforcement of law. As long as public plunderers\r\nwhen detected can find a haven of refuge in any foreign land and avoid\r\npunishment, just so long encouragement is given them to continue their\r\npractices. If we fail to do all that in us lies to stamp out corruption\r\nwe can not escape our share of responsibility for the guilt. The first\r\nrequisite of successful self-government is unflinching enforcement of\r\nthe law and the cutting out of corruption.\r\n\r\nFor several years past the rapid development of Alaska and the\r\nestablishment of growing American interests in regions theretofore\r\nunsurveyed and imperfectly known brought into prominence the urgent\r\nnecessity of a practical demarcation of the boundaries between the\r\njurisdictions of the United States and Great Britain. Although the\r\ntreaty of 1825 between Great Britain and Russia, the provisions of\r\nwhich were copied in the treaty of 1867, whereby Russia conveyed Alaska\r\nto the United States, was positive as to the control, first by Russia\r\nand later by the United States, of a strip of territory along the\r\ncontinental mainland from the western shore of Portland Canal to Mount\r\nSt. Elias, following and surrounding the indentations of the coast and\r\nincluding the islands to the westward, its description of the landward\r\nmargin of the strip was indefinite, resting on the supposed existence\r\nof a continuous ridge or range of mountains skirting the coast, as\r\nfigured in the charts of the early navigators. It had at no time been\r\npossible for either party in interest to lay down, under the authority\r\nof the treaty, a line so obviously exact according to its provisions as\r\nto command the assent of the other. For nearly three-fourths of a\r\ncentury the absence of tangible local interests demanding the exercise\r\nof positive jurisdiction on either side of the border left the question\r\ndormant. In 1878 questions of revenue administration on the Stikine\r\nRiver led to the establishment of a provisional demarcation, crossing\r\nthe channel between two high peaks on either side about twenty-four\r\nmiles above the river mouth. In 1899 similar questions growing out of\r\nthe extraordinary development of mining interests in the region about\r\nthe head of Lynn Canal brought about a temporary modus vivendi, by\r\nwhich a convenient separation was made at the watershed divides of the\r\nWhite and Chilkoot passes and to the north of Klukwan, on the Klehini\r\nRiver. These partial and tentative adjustments could not, in the very\r\nnature of things, be satisfactory or lasting. A permanent disposition\r\nof the matter became imperative.\r\n\r\nAfter unavailing attempts to reach an understanding through a Joint\r\nHigh Commission, followed by prolonged negotiations, conducted in an\r\namicable spirit, a convention between the United States and Great\r\nBritain was signed, January 24, 1903, providing for an examination of\r\nthe subject by a mixed tribunal of six members, three on a side, with a\r\nview to its final disposition. Ratifications were exchanged on March 3\r\nlast, whereupon the two Governments appointed their respective members.\r\nThose on behalf of the United States were Elihu Root, Secretary of War,\r\nHenry Cabot Lodge, a Senator of the United States, and George Turner,\r\nan ex-Senator of the United States, while Great Britain named the Right\r\nHonourable Lord Alverstone, Lord Chief Justice of England, Sir Louis\r\nAmable Jette, K. C. M. G., retired judge of the Supreme Court of\r\nQuebec, and A. B. Aylesworth, K. C., of Toronto. This Tribunal met in\r\nLondon on September 3, under the Presidency of Lord Alverstone. The\r\nproceedings were expeditious, and marked by a friendly and\r\nconscientious spirit. The respective cases, counter cases, and\r\narguments presented the issues clearly and fully. On the 20th of\r\nOctober a majority of the Tribunal reached and signed an agreement on\r\nall the questions submitted by the terms of the Convention. By this\r\naward the right of the United States to the control of a continuous\r\nstrip or border of the mainland shore, skirting all the tide-water\r\ninlets and sinuosities of the coast, is confirmed; the entrance to\r\nPortland Canal (concerning which legitimate doubt appeared) is defined\r\nas passing by Tongass Inlet and to the northwestward of Wales and\r\nPearse islands; a line is drawn from the head of Portland Canal to the\r\nfifty-sixth degree of north latitude; and the interior border line of\r\nthe strip is fixed by lines connecting certain mountain summits lying\r\nbetween Portland Canal and Mount St. Elias, and running along the crest\r\nof the divide separating the coast slope from the inland watershed at\r\nthe only part of the frontier where the drainage ridge approaches the\r\ncoast within the distance of ten marine leagues stipulated by the\r\ntreaty as the extreme width of the strip around the heads of Lynn Canal\r\nand its branches.\r\n\r\nWhile the line so traced follows the provisional demarcation of 1878 at\r\nthe crossing of the Stikine River, and that of 1899 at the summits of\r\nthe White and Chilkoot passes, it runs much farther inland from the\r\nKlehini than the temporary line of the later modus vivendi, and leaves\r\nthe entire mining district of the Porcupine River and Glacier Creek\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe result is satisfactory in every way. It is of great material\r\nadvantage to our people in the Far Northwest. It has removed from the\r\nfield of discussion and possible danger a question liable to become\r\nmore acutely accentuated with each passing year. Finally, it has\r\nfurnished a signal proof of the fairness and good will with which two\r\nfriendly nations can approach and determine issues involving national\r\nsovereignty and by their nature incapable of submission to a third\r\npower for adjudication.\r\n\r\nThe award is self-executing on the vital points. To make it effective\r\nas regards the others it only remains for the two Governments to\r\nappoint, each on its own behalf, one or more scientific experts, who\r\nshall, with all convenient speed, proceed together to lay down the\r\nboundary line in accordance with the decision of the majority of the\r\nTribunal. I recommend that the Congress make adequate provision for the\r\nappointment, compensation, and expenses of the members to serve on this\r\njoint boundary commission on the part of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that during the second session of the last\r\nCongress Great Britain, Germany, and Italy formed an alliance for the\r\npurpose of blockading the ports of Venezuela and using such other means\r\nof pressure as would secure a settlement of claims due, as they\r\nalleged, to certain of their subjects. Their employment of force for\r\nthe collection of these claims was terminated by an agreement brought\r\nabout through the offices of the diplomatic representatives of the\r\nUnited States at Caracas and the Government at Washington, thereby\r\nending a situation which was bound to cause increasing friction, and\r\nwhich jeoparded the peace of the continent. Under this agreement\r\nVenezuela agreed to set apart a certain percentage of the customs\r\nreceipts of two of her ports to be applied to the payment of whatever\r\nobligations might be ascertained by mixed commissions appointed for\r\nthat purpose to be due from her, not only to the three powers already\r\nmentioned, whose proceedings against her had resulted in a state of\r\nwar, but also to the United States, France, Spain, Belgium, the\r\nNetherland Sweden and Norway, and Mexico, who had not employed force\r\nfor the collection of the claims alleged to be due to certain of their\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nA demand was then made by the so-called blockading powers that the sums\r\nascertained to be due to their citizens by such mixed commissions\r\nshould be accorded payment in full before anything was paid upon the\r\nclaims of any of the so-called peace powers. Venezuela, on the other\r\nhand, insisted that all her creditors should be paid upon a basis of\r\nexact equality. During the efforts to adjust this dispute it was\r\nsuggested by the powers in interest that it should be referred to me\r\nfor decision, but I was clearly of the opinion that a far wiser course\r\nwould be to submit the question to the Permanent Court of Arbitration\r\nat The Hague. It seemed to me to offer an admirable opportunity to\r\nadvance the practice of the peaceful settlement of disputes between\r\nnations and to secure for the Hague Tribunal a memorable increase of\r\nits practical importance. The nations interested in the controversy\r\nwere so numerous and in many instances so powerful as to make it\r\nevident that beneficent results would follow from their appearance at\r\nthe same time before the bar of that august tribunal of peace.\r\n\r\nOur hopes in that regard have been realized. Russia and Austria are\r\nrepresented in the persons of the learned and distinguished jurists who\r\ncompose the Tribunal, while Great Britain, Germany, France, Spain,\r\nItaly, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway, Mexico, the United\r\nStates, and Venezuela are represented by their respective agents and\r\ncounsel. Such an imposing concourse of nations presenting their\r\narguments to and invoking the decision of that high court of\r\ninternational justice and international peace can hardly fail to secure\r\na like submission of many future controversies. The nations now\r\nappearing there will find it far easier to appear there a second time,\r\nwhile no nation can imagine its just pride will be lessened by\r\nfollowing the example now presented. This triumph of the principle of\r\ninternational arbitration is a subject of warm congratulation and\r\noffers a happy augury for the peace of the world.\r\n\r\nThere seems good ground for the belief that there has been a real\r\ngrowth among the civilized nations of a sentiment which will permit a\r\ngradual substitution of other methods than the method of war in the\r\nsettlement of disputes. It is not pretended that as yet we are near a\r\nposition in which it will be possible wholly to prevent war, or that a\r\njust regard for national interest and honor will in all cases permit of\r\nthe settlement of international disputes by arbitration; but by a\r\nmixture of prudence and firmness with wisdom we think it is possible to\r\ndo away with much of the provocation and excuse for war, and at least\r\nin many cases to substitute some other and more rational method for the\r\nsettlement of disputes. The Hague Court offers so good an example of\r\nwhat can be done in the direction of such settlement that it should be\r\nencouraged in every way.\r\n\r\nFurther steps should be taken. In President McKinley's annual Message\r\nof December 5, 1898, he made the following recommendation:\r\n\r\n\"The experiences of the last year bring forcibly home to us a sense of\r\nthe burdens and the waste of war. We desire in common with most\r\ncivilized nations, to reduce to the lowest possible point the damage\r\nsustained in time of war by peaceable trade and commerce. It is true we\r\nmay suffer in such cases less than other communities, but all nations\r\nare damaged more or less by the state of uneasiness and apprehension\r\ninto which an outbreak of hostilities throws the entire commercial\r\nworld. It should be our object, therefore, to minimize, so far as\r\npracticable, this inevitable loss and disturbance. This purpose can\r\nprobably best be accomplished by an international agreement to regard\r\nall private property at sea as exempt from capture or destruction by\r\nthe forces of belligerent powers. The United States Government has for\r\nmany years advocated this humane and beneficent principle, and is now\r\nin a position to recommend it to other powers without the imputation of\r\nselfish motives. I therefore suggest for your consideration that the\r\nExecutive be authorized to correspond with the governments of the\r\nprincipal maritime powers with a view of incorporating into the\r\npermanent law of civilized nations the principle of the exemption of\r\nall private property at sea, not contraband of war, from capture or\r\ndestruction by belligerent powers.\"\r\n\r\nI cordially renew this recommendation.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court, speaking on December 11. 1899, through Peckham, J.,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"It is, we think, historically accurate to say that this Government has\r\nalways been, in its views, among the most advanced of the governments\r\nof the world in favor of mitigating, as to all non-combatants, the\r\nhardships and horrors of war. To accomplish that object it has always\r\nadvocated those rules which would in most cases do away with the right\r\nto capture the private property of an enemy on the high seas.\"\r\n\r\nI advocate this as a matter of humanity and morals. It is anachronistic\r\nwhen private property is respected on land that it should not be\r\nrespected at sea. Moreover, it should be borne in mind that shipping\r\nrepresents, internationally speaking, a much more generalized species\r\nof private property than is the case with ordinary property on\r\nland--that is, property found at sea is much less apt than is the case\r\nwith property found on land really to belong to any one nation. Under\r\nthe modern system of corporate ownership the flag of a vessel often\r\ndiffers from the flag which would mark the nationality of the real\r\nownership and money control of the vessel; and the cargo may belong to\r\nindividuals of yet a different nationality. Much American capital is\r\nnow invested in foreign ships; and among foreign nations it often\r\nhappens that the capital of one is largely invested in the shipping of\r\nanother. Furthermore, as a practical matter, it may be mentioned that\r\nwhile commerce destroying may cause serious loss and great annoyance,\r\nit can never be more than a subsidiary factor in bringing to terms a\r\nresolute foe. This is now well recognized by all of our naval experts.\r\nThe fighting ship, not the commerce destroyer, is the vessel whose\r\nfeats add renown to a nation's history, and establish her place among\r\nthe great powers of the world.\r\n\r\nLast year the Interparliamentary Union for International Arbitration\r\nmet at Vienna, six hundred members of the different legislatures of\r\ncivilized countries attending. It was provided that the next meeting\r\nshould be in 1904 at St. Louis, subject to our Congress extending an\r\ninvitation. Like the Hague Tribunal, this Interparliamentary Union is\r\none of the forces tending towards peace among the nations of the earth,\r\nand it is entitled to our support. I trust the invitation can be\r\nextended.\r\n\r\nEarly in July, having received intelligence, which happily turned out\r\nto be erroneous, of the assassination of our vice-consul at Beirut, I\r\ndispatched a small squadron to that port for such service as might be\r\nfound necessary on arrival. Although the attempt on the life of our\r\nvice-consul had not been successful, yet the outrage was symptomatic of\r\na state of excitement and disorder which demanded immediate attention.\r\nThe arrival of the vessels had the happiest result. A feeling of\r\nsecurity at once took the place of the former alarm and disquiet; our\r\nofficers were cordially welcomed by the consular body and the leading\r\nmerchants, and ordinary business resumed its activity. The Government\r\nof the Sultan gave a considerate hearing to the representations of our\r\nminister; the official who was regarded as responsible for the\r\ndisturbed condition of affairs was removed. Our relations with the\r\nTurkish Government remain friendly; our claims rounded on inequitable\r\ntreatment of some of our schools and missions appear to be in process\r\nof amicable adjustment.\r\n\r\nThe signing of a new commercial treaty with China, which took place at\r\nShanghai on the 8th of October, is a cause for satisfaction. This act,\r\nthe result of long discussion and negotiation, places our commercial\r\nrelations with the great Oriental Empire on a more satisfactory footing\r\nthan they have ever heretofore enjoyed. It provides not only for the\r\nordinary rights and privileges of diplomatic and consular officers, but\r\nalso for an important extension of our commerce by increased facility\r\nof access to Chinese ports, and for the relief of trade by the removal\r\nof some of the obstacles which have embarrassed it in the past. The\r\nChinese Government engages, on fair and equitable conditions, which\r\nwill probably be accepted by the principal commercial nations, to\r\nabandon the levy of \"liken\" and other transit dues throughout the\r\nEmpire, and to introduce other desirable administrative reforms. Larger\r\nfacilities are to be given to our citizens who desire to carry on\r\nmining enterprises in China. We have secured for our missionaries a\r\nvaluable privilege, the recognition of their right to rent and lease in\r\nperpetuity such property as their religious societies may need in all\r\nparts of the Empire. And, what was an indispensable condition for the\r\nadvance and development of our commerce in Manchuria, China, by treaty\r\nwith us, has opened to foreign commerce the cities of Mukden, the\r\ncapital of the province of Manchuria, and An-tung, an important port on\r\nthe Yalu River, on the road to Korea. The full measure of development\r\nwhich our commerce may rightfully expect can hardly be looked for until\r\nthe settlement of the present abnormal state of things in the Empire;\r\nbut the foundation for such development has at last been laid.\r\n\r\nI call your attention to the reduced cost in maintaining the consular\r\nservice for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1903, as shown in the\r\nannual report of the Auditor for the State and other Departments, as\r\ncompared with the year previous. For the year under consideration the\r\nexcess of expenditures over receipts on account of the consular service\r\namounted to $26,125.12, as against $96,972.50 for the year ending June\r\n30, 1902, and $147,040.16 for the year ending June 30, 1901. This is\r\nthe best showing in this respect for the consular service for the past\r\nfourteen years, and the reduction in the cost of the service to the\r\nGovernment has been made in spite of the fact that the expenditures for\r\nthe year in question were more than $20,000 greater than for the\r\nprevious year.\r\n\r\nThe rural free-delivery service has been steadily extended. The\r\nattention of the Congress is asked to the question of the compensation\r\nof the letter carriers and clerks engaged in the postal service,\r\nespecially on the new rural free-delivery routes. More routes have been\r\ninstalled since the first of July last than in any like period in the\r\nDepartment's history. While a due regard to economy must be kept in\r\nmind in the establishment of new routes, yet the extension of the rural\r\nfree-delivery system must be continued, for reasons of sound public\r\npolicy. No governmental movement of recent years has resulted in\r\ngreater immediate benefit to the people of the country districts. Rural\r\nfree delivery, taken in connection with the telephone, the bicycle, and\r\nthe trolley, accomplishes much toward lessening the isolation of farm\r\nlife and making it brighter and more attractive. In the immediate past\r\nthe lack of just such facilities as these has driven many of the more\r\nactive and restless young men and women from the farms to the cities;\r\nfor they rebelled at loneliness and lack of mental companionship. It is\r\nunhealthy and undesirable for the cities to grow at the expense of the\r\ncountry; and rural free delivery is not only a good thing in itself,\r\nbut is good because it is one of the causes which check this\r\nunwholesome tendency towards the urban concentration of our population\r\nat the expense of the country districts. It is for the same reason that\r\nwe sympathize with and approve of the policy of building good roads.\r\nThe movement for good roads is one fraught with the greatest benefit to\r\nthe country districts.\r\n\r\nI trust that the Congress will continue to favor in all proper ways the\r\nLouisiana Purchase Exposition. This Exposition commemorates the\r\nLouisiana purchase, which was the first great step in the expansion\r\nwhich made us a continental nation. The expedition of Lewis and Clark\r\nacross the continent followed thereon, and marked the beginning of the\r\nprocess of exploration and colonization which thrust our national\r\nboundaries to the Pacific. The acquisition of the Oregon country,\r\nincluding the present States of Oregon and Washington, was a fact of\r\nimmense importance in our history; first giving us our place on the\r\nPacific seaboard, and making ready the way for our ascendency in the\r\ncommerce of the greatest of the oceans. The centennial of our\r\nestablishment upon the western coast by the expedition of Lewis and\r\nClark is to be celebrated at Portland, Oregon, by an exposition in the\r\nsummer of 1905, and this event should receive recognition and support\r\nfrom the National Government.\r\n\r\nI call your special attention to the Territory of Alaska. The country\r\nis developing rapidly, and it has an assured future. The mineral wealth\r\nis great and has as yet hardly been tapped. The fisheries, if wisely\r\nhandled and kept under national control, will be a business as\r\npermanent as any other, and of the utmost importance to the people. The\r\nforests if properly guarded will form another great source of wealth.\r\nPortions of Alaska are fitted for farming and stock raising, although\r\nthe methods must be adapted to the peculiar conditions of the country.\r\nAlaska is situated in the far north; but so are Norway and Sweden and\r\nFinland; and Alaska can prosper and play its part in the New World just\r\nas those nations have prospered and played their parts in the Old\r\nWorld. Proper land laws should be enacted; and the survey of the public\r\nlands immediately begun. Coal-land laws should be provided whereby the\r\ncoal-land entryman may make his location and secure patent under\r\nmethods kindred to those now prescribed for homestead and mineral\r\nentrymen. Salmon hatcheries, exclusively under Government control,\r\nshould be established. The cable should be extended from Sitka\r\nwestward. Wagon roads and trails should be built, and the building of\r\nrailroads promoted in all legitimate ways. Light-houses should be built\r\nalong the coast. Attention should be paid to the needs of the Alaska\r\nIndians; provision should be made for an officer, with deputies, to\r\nstudy their needs, relieve their immediate wants, and help them adapt\r\nthemselves to the new conditions.\r\n\r\nThe commission appointed to investigate, during the season of 1903, the\r\ncondition and needs of the Alaskan salmon fisheries, has finished its\r\nwork in the field, and is preparing a detailed report thereon. A\r\npreliminary report reciting the measures immediately required for the\r\nprotection and preservation of the salmon industry has already been\r\nsubmitted to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor for his attention and\r\nfor the needed action.\r\n\r\nI recommend that an appropriation be made for building light-houses in\r\nHawaii, and taking possession of those already built. The Territory\r\nshould be reimbursed for whatever amounts it has already expended for\r\nlight-houses. The governor should be empowered to suspend or remove any\r\nofficial appointed by him, without submitting the matter to the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nOf our insular possessions the Philippines and Porto Rico it is\r\ngratifying to say that their steady progress has been such as to make\r\nit unnecessary to spend much time in discussing them. Yet the Congress\r\nshould ever keep in mind that a peculiar obligation rests upon us to\r\nfurther in every way the welfare of these communities. The Philippines\r\nshould be knit closer to us by tariff arrangements. It would, of\r\ncourse, be impossible suddenly to raise the people of the islands to\r\nthe high pitch of industrial prosperity and of governmental efficiency\r\nto which they will in the end by degrees attain; and the caution and\r\nmoderation shown in developing them have been among the main reasons\r\nwhy this development has hitherto gone on so smoothly. Scrupulous care\r\nhas been taken in the choice of governmental agents, and the entire\r\nelimination of partisan politics from the public service. The condition\r\nof the islanders is in material things far better than ever before,\r\nwhile their governmental, intellectual, and moral advance has kept pace\r\nwith their material advance. No one people ever benefited another\r\npeople more than we have benefited the Filipinos by taking possession\r\nof the islands.\r\n\r\nThe cash receipts of the General Land Office for the last fiscal year\r\nwere $11,024,743.65, an increase of $4,762,816.47 over the preceding\r\nyear. Of this sum, approximately, $8,461,493 will go to the credit of\r\nthe fund for the reclamation of arid land, making the total of this\r\nfund, up to the 30th of June, 1903, approximately, $16,191,836.\r\n\r\nA gratifying disposition has been evinced by those having unlawful\r\ninclosures of public land to remove their fences. Nearly two million\r\nacres so inclosed have been thrown open on demand. In but comparatively\r\nfew cases has it been necessary to go into court to accomplish this\r\npurpose. This work will be vigorously prosecuted until all unlawful\r\ninclosures have been removed.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that in the western States themselves, as well as\r\nin the rest of the country, there is widespread conviction that certain\r\nof the public-land laws and the resulting administrative practice no\r\nlonger meet the present needs. The character and uses of the remaining\r\npublic lands differ widely from those of the public lands which\r\nCongress had especially in view when these laws were passed. The\r\nrapidly increasing rate of disposal of the public lands is not followed\r\nby a corresponding increase in home building. There is a tendency to\r\nmass in large holdings public lands, especially timber and grazing\r\nlands, and thereby to retard settlement. I renew and emphasize my\r\nrecommendation of last year that so far as they are available for\r\nagriculture in its broadest sense, and to whatever extent they may be\r\nreclaimed under the national irrigation law, the remaining public lands\r\nshould be held rigidly for the home builder. The attention of the\r\nCongress is especially directed to the timber and stone law, the\r\ndesert-land law, and the commutation clause of the homestead law, which\r\nin their operation have in many respects conflicted with wise\r\npublic-land policy. The discussions in the Congress and elsewhere have\r\nmade it evident that there is a wide divergence of opinions between\r\nthose holding opposite views on these subjects; and that the opposing\r\nsides have strong and convinced representatives of weight both within\r\nand without the Congress; the differences being not only as to matters\r\nof opinion but as to matters of fact. In order that definite\r\ninformation may be available for the use of the Congress, I have\r\nappointed a commission composed of W. A. Richards, Commissioner of the\r\nGeneral Land Office; Gifford Pinchot, Chief of the Bureau of Forestry\r\nof the Department of Agriculture, and F. H. Newell, Chief Hydrographer\r\nof the Geological Survey, to report at the earliest practicable moment\r\nupon the condition, operation, and effect of the present land laws and\r\non the use, condition, disposal, and settlement of the public lands.\r\nThe commission will report especially what changes in organization,\r\nlaws, regulations, and practice affecting the public lands are needed\r\nto effect the largest practicable disposition of the public lands to\r\nactual settlers who will build permanent homes upon them, and to secure\r\nin permanence the fullest and most effective use of the resources of\r\nthe public lands; and it will make such other reports and\r\nrecommendations as its study of these questions may suggest. The\r\ncommission is to report immediately upon those points concerning which\r\nits judgment is clear; on any point upon which it has doubt it will\r\ntake the time necessary to make investigation and reach a final\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nThe work of reclamation of the arid lands of the West is progressing\r\nsteadily and satisfactorily under the terms of the law setting aside\r\nthe proceeds from the disposal of public lands. The corps of engineers\r\nknown as the Reclamation Service, which is conducting the surveys and\r\nexaminations, has been thoroughly organized, especial pains being taken\r\nto secure under the civil-service rules a body of skilled, experienced,\r\nand efficient men. Surveys and examinations are progressing throughout\r\nthe arid States and Territories, plans for reclaiming works being\r\nprepared and passed upon by boards of engineers before approval by the\r\nSecretary of the Interior. In Arizona and Nevada, in localities where\r\nsuch work is pre-eminently needed, construction has already been begun.\r\nIn other parts of the arid West various projects are well advanced\r\ntowards the drawing up of contracts, these being delayed in part by\r\nnecessities of reaching agreements or understanding as regards rights\r\nof way or acquisition of real estate. Most of the works contemplated\r\nfor construction are of national importance, involving interstate\r\nquestions or the securing of stable, self-supporting communities in the\r\nmidst of vast tracts of vacant land. The Nation as a whole is of course\r\nthe gainer by the creation of these homes, adding as they do to the\r\nwealth and stability of the country, and furnishing a home market for\r\nthe products of the East and South. The reclamation law, while perhaps\r\nnot ideal, appears at present to answer the larger needs for which it\r\nis designed. Further legislation is not recommended until the\r\nnecessities of change are more apparent.\r\n\r\nThe study of the opportunities of reclamation of the vast extent of\r\narid land shows that whether this reclamation is done by individuals,\r\ncorporations, or the State, the sources of water supply must be\r\neffectively protected and the reservoirs guarded by the preservation of\r\nthe forests at the headwaters of the streams. The engineers making the\r\npreliminary examinations continually emphasize this need and urge that\r\nthe remaining public lands at the headwaters of the important streams\r\nof the West be reserved to insure permanency of water supply for\r\nirrigation. Much progress in forestry has been made during the past\r\nyear. The necessity for perpetuating our forest resources, whether in\r\npublic or private hands, is recognized now as never before. The demand\r\nfor forest reserves has become insistent in the West, because the West\r\nmust use the water, wood, and summer range which only such reserves can\r\nsupply. Progressive lumbermen are striving, through forestry, to give\r\ntheir business permanence. Other great business interests are awakening\r\nto the need of forest preservation as a business matter. The\r\nGovernment's forest work should receive from the Congress hearty\r\nsupport, and especially support adequate for the protection of the\r\nforest reserves against fire. The forest-reserve policy of the\r\nGovernment has passed beyond the experimental stage and has reached a\r\ncondition where scientific methods are essential to its successful\r\nprosecution. The administrative features of forest reserves are at\r\npresent unsatisfactory, being divided between three Bureaus of two\r\nDepartments. It is therefore recommended that all matters pertaining to\r\nforest reserves, except those involving or pertaining to land titles,\r\nbe consolidated in the Bureau of Forestry of the Department of\r\nAgriculture.\r\n\r\nThe cotton-growing States have recently been invaded by a weevil that\r\nhas done much damage and threatens the entire cotton industry. I\r\nsuggest to the Congress the prompt enactment of such remedial\r\nlegislation as its judgment may approve.\r\n\r\nIn granting patents to foreigners the proper course for this country to\r\nfollow is to give the same advantages to foreigners here that the\r\ncountries in which these foreigners dwell extend in return to our\r\ncitizens; that is, to extend the benefits of our patent laws on\r\ninventions and the like where in return the articles would be\r\npatentable in the foreign countries concerned--where an American could\r\nget a corresponding patent in such countries.\r\n\r\nThe Indian agents should not be dependent for their appointment or\r\ntenure of office upon considerations of partisan politics; the practice\r\nof appointing, when possible, ex-army officers or bonded\r\nsuperintendents to the vacancies that occur is working well. Attention\r\nis invited to the widespread illiteracy due to lack of public schools\r\nin the Indian Territory. Prompt heed should be paid to the need of\r\neducation for the children in this Territory.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual Message the attention of the Congress was called to\r\nthe necessity of enlarging the safety-appliance law, and it is\r\ngratifying to note that this law was amended in important respects.\r\nWith the increasing railway mileage of the country, the greater number\r\nof men employed, and the use of larger and heavier equipment, the\r\nurgency for renewed effort to prevent the loss of life and limb upon\r\nthe railroads of the country, particularly to employees, is apparent.\r\nFor the inspection of water craft and the Life-Saving Service upon the\r\nwater the Congress has built up an elaborate body of protective\r\nlegislation and a thorough method of inspection and is annually\r\nspending large sums of money. It is encouraging to observe that the\r\nCongress is alive to the interests of those who are employed upon our\r\nwonderful arteries of commerce--the railroads--who so safely transport\r\nmillions of passengers and billions of tons of freight. The Federal\r\ninspection, of safety appliances, for which the Congress is now making\r\nappropriations, is a service analogous to that which the Government has\r\nupheld for generations in regard to vessels, and it is believed will\r\nprove of great practical benefit, both to railroad employees and the\r\ntraveling public. As the greater part of commerce is interstate and\r\nexclusively under the control of the Congress the needed safety and\r\nuniformity must be secured by national legislation.\r\n\r\nNo other class of our citizens deserves so well of the Nation as those\r\nto whom the Nation owes its very being, the veterans of the civil war.\r\nSpecial attention is asked to the excellent work of the Pension Bureau\r\nin expediting and disposing of pension claims. During the fiscal year\r\nending July 1, 1903, the Bureau settled 251,982 claims, an average of\r\n825 claims for each working day of the year. The number of settlements\r\nsince July 1, 1903, has been in excess of last year's average,\r\napproaching 1,000 claims for each working day, and it is believed that\r\nthe work of the Bureau will be current at the close of the present\r\nfiscal year.\r\n\r\nDuring the year ended June 30 last 25,566 persons were appointed\r\nthrough competitive examinations under the civil-service rules. This\r\nwas 12,672 more than during the preceding year, and 40 per cent of\r\nthose who passed the examinations. This abnormal growth was largely\r\noccasioned by the extension of classification to the rural\r\nfree-delivery service and the appointment last year of over 9,000 rural\r\ncarriers. A revision of the civil-service rules took effect on April 15\r\nlast, which has greatly improved their operation. The completion of the\r\nreform of the civil service is recognized by good citizens everywhere\r\nas a matter of the highest public importance, and the success of the\r\nmerit system largely depends upon the effectiveness of the rules and\r\nthe machinery provided for their enforcement. A very gratifying spirit\r\nof friendly co-operation exists in all the Departments of the\r\nGovernment in the enforcement and uniform observance of both the letter\r\nand spirit of the civil-service act. Executive orders of July 3, 1902;\r\nMarch 26, 1903, and July 8, 1903, require that appointments of all\r\nunclassified laborers, both in the Departments at Washington and in the\r\nfield service, shall be made with the assistance of the United States\r\nCivil Service Commission, under a system of registration to test the\r\nrelative fitness of applicants for appointment or employment. This\r\nsystem is competitive, and is open to all citizens of the United States\r\nqualified in respect to age, physical ability, moral character,\r\nindustry, and adaptability for manual labor; except that in case of\r\nveterans of the Civil War the element of age is omitted. This system of\r\nappointment is distinct from the classified service and does not\r\nclassify positions of mere laborer under the civil-service act and\r\nrules. Regulations in aid thereof have been put in operation in several\r\nof the Departments and are being gradually extended in other parts of\r\nthe service. The results have been very satisfactory, as extravagance\r\nhas been checked by decreasing the number of unnecessary positions and\r\nby increasing the efficiency of the employees remaining.\r\n\r\nThe Congress, as the result of a thorough investigation of the\r\ncharities and reformatory institutions in the District of Columbia, by\r\na joint select committee of the two Houses which made its report in\r\nMarch, 1898, created in the act approved June 6, 1900, a board of\r\ncharities for the District of Columbia, to consist of five residents of\r\nthe District, appointed by the President of the United States, by and\r\nwith the advice and consent of the Senate, each for a term of three\r\nyears, to serve without compensation. President McKinley appointed five\r\nmen who had been active and prominent in the public charities in\r\nWashington, all of whom upon taking office July 1, 1900, resigned from\r\nthe different charities with which they had been connected. The members\r\nof the board have been reappointed in successive years. The board\r\nserves under the Commissioners of the District of Columbia. The board\r\ngave its first year to a careful and impartial study of the special\r\nproblems before it, and has continued that study every year in the\r\nlight of the best practice in public charities elsewhere. Its\r\nrecommendations in its annual reports to the Congress through the\r\nCommissioners of the District of Columbia \"for the economical and\r\nefficient administration of the charities and reformatories of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia,\" as required by the act creating it, have been\r\nbased upon the principles commended by the joint select committee of\r\nthe Congress in its report of March, 1898, and approved by the best\r\nadministrators of public charities, and make for the desired\r\nsystematization and improvement of the affairs under its supervision.\r\nThey are worthy of favorable consideration by the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the laws providing a General Staff for the Army and for\r\nthe more effective use of the National Guard has been excellent. Great\r\nimprovement has been made in the efficiency of our Army in recent\r\nyears. Such schools as those erected at Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley\r\nand the institution of fall maneuver work accomplish satisfactory\r\nresults. The good effect of these maneuvers upon the National Guard is\r\nmarked, and ample appropriation should be made to enable the guardsmen\r\nof the several States to share in the benefit. The Government should as\r\nsoon as possible secure suitable permanent camp sites for military\r\nmaneuvers in the various sections of the country. The service thereby\r\nrendered not only to the Regular Army, but to the National Guard of the\r\nseveral States, will be so great as to repay many times over the\r\nrelatively small expense. We should not rest satisfied with what has\r\nbeen done, however. The only people who are contented with a system of\r\npromotion by mere seniority are those who are contented with the\r\ntriumph of mediocrity over excellence. On the other hand, a system\r\nwhich encouraged the exercise of social or political favoritism in\r\npromotions would be even worse. But it would surely be easy to devise a\r\nmethod of promotion from grade to grade in which the opinion of the\r\nhigher officers of the service upon the candidates should be decisive\r\nupon the standing and promotion of the latter. Just such a system now\r\nobtains at West Point. The quality of each year's work determines the\r\nstanding of that year's class, the man being dropped or graduated into\r\nthe next class in the relative position which his military superiors\r\ndecide to be warranted by his merit. In other words, ability, energy,\r\nfidelity, and all other similar qualities determine the rank of a man\r\nyear after year in West Point, and his standing in the Army when he\r\ngraduates from West Point; but from that time on, all effort to find\r\nwhich man is best or worst, and reward or punish him accordingly, is\r\nabandoned; no brilliancy, no amount of hard work, no eagerness in the\r\nperformance of duty, can advance him, and no slackness or indifference\r\nthat falls short of a court-martial offense can retard him. Until this\r\nsystem is changed we can not hope that our officers will be of as high\r\ngrade as we have a right to expect, considering the material upon which\r\nwe draw. Moreover, when a man renders such service as Captain Pershing\r\nrendered last spring in the Moro campaign, it ought to be possible\r\nto reward him without at once jumping him to the grade of\r\nbrigadier-general.\r\n\r\nShortly after the enunciation of that famous principle of American\r\nforeign policy now known as the \"Monroe Doctrine,\" President Monroe, in\r\na special Message to Congress on January 30, 1824, spoke as follows:\r\n\"The Navy is the arm from which our Government will always derive most\r\naid in support of our rights. Every power engaged in war will know the\r\nstrength of our naval power, the number of our ships of each class,\r\ntheir condition, and the promptitude with which we may bring them into\r\nservice, and will pay due consideration to that argument.\"\r\n\r\nI heartily congratulate the Congress upon the steady progress in\r\nbuilding up the American Navy. We can not afford a let-up in this great\r\nwork. To stand still means to go back. There should be no cessation in\r\nadding to the effective units of the fighting strength of the fleet.\r\nMeanwhile the Navy Department and the officers of the Navy are doing\r\nwell their part by providing constant service at sea under conditions\r\nakin to those of actual warfare. Our officers and enlisted men are\r\nlearning to handle the battleships, cruisers, and torpedo boats with\r\nhigh efficiency in fleet and squadron formations, and the standard of\r\nmarksmanship is being steadily raised. The best work ashore is\r\nindispensable, but the highest duty of a naval officer is to exercise\r\ncommand at sea.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a naval base in the Philippines ought not to be\r\nlonger postponed. Such a base is desirable in time of peace; in time of\r\nwar it would be indispensable, and its lack would be ruinous. Without\r\nit our fleet would be helpless. Our naval experts are agreed that Subig\r\nBay is the proper place for the purpose. The national interests require\r\nthat the work of fortification and development of a naval station at\r\nSubig Bay be begun at an early date; for under the best conditions it\r\nis a work which will consume much time.\r\n\r\nIt is eminently desirable, however, that there should be provided a\r\nnaval general staff on lines similar to those of the General Staff\r\nlately created for the Army. Within the Navy Department itself the\r\nneeds of the service have brought about a system under which the duties\r\nof a general staff are partially performed; for the Bureau of\r\nNavigation has under its direction the War College, the Office of Naval\r\nIntelligence, and the Board of Inspection, and has been in close touch\r\nwith the General Board of the Navy. But though under the excellent\r\nofficers at their head, these boards and bureaus do good work, they\r\nhave not the authority of a general staff, and have not sufficient\r\nscope to insure a proper readiness for emergencies. We need the\r\nestablishment by law of a body of trained officers, who shall exercise\r\na systematic control of the military affairs of the Navy, and be\r\nauthorized advisers of the Secretary concerning it.\r\n\r\nBy the act of June 28, 1902, the Congress authorized the President to\r\nenter into treaty with Colombia for the building of the canal across\r\nthe Isthmus of Panama; it being provided that in the event of failure\r\nto secure such treaty after the lapse of a reasonable time, recourse\r\nshould be had to building a canal through Nicaragua. It has not been\r\nnecessary to consider this alternative, as I am enabled to lay before\r\nthe Senate a treaty providing for the building of the canal across the\r\nIsthmus of Panama. This was the route which commended itself to the\r\ndeliberate judgment of the Congress, and we can now acquire by treaty\r\nthe right to construct the canal over this route. The question now,\r\ntherefore, is not by which route the isthmian canal shall be built, for\r\nthat question has been definitely and irrevocably decided. The question\r\nis simply whether or not we shall have an isthmian canal.\r\n\r\nWhen the Congress directed that we should take the Panama route under\r\ntreaty with Colombia, the essence of the condition, of course, referred\r\nnot to the Government which controlled that route, but to the route\r\nitself; to the territory across which the route lay, not to the name\r\nwhich for the moment the territory bore on the map. The purpose of the\r\nlaw was to authorize the President to make a treaty with the power in\r\nactual control of the Isthmus of Panama. This purpose has been\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1846 this Government entered into a treaty with New\r\nGranada, the predecessor upon the Isthmus of the Republic of Colombia\r\nand of the present Republic of Panama, by which treaty it was provided\r\nthat the Government and citizens of the United States should always\r\nhave free and open right of way or transit across the Isthmus of Panama\r\nby any modes of communication that might be constructed, while in turn\r\nour Government guaranteed the perfect neutrality of the above-mentioned\r\nIsthmus with the view that the free transit from the one to the other\r\nsea might not be interrupted or embarrassed. The treaty vested in the\r\nUnited States a substantial property right carved out of the rights of\r\nsovereignty and property which New Granada then had and possessed over\r\nthe said territory. The name of New Granada has passed away and its\r\nterritory has been divided. Its successor, the Government of Colombia,\r\nhas ceased to own any property in the Isthmus. A new Republic, that of\r\nPanama, which was at one time a sovereign state, and at another time a\r\nmere department of the successive confederations known as New Granada\r\nand Columbia, has now succeeded to the rights which first one and then\r\nthe other formerly exercised over the Isthmus. But as long as the\r\nIsthmus endures, the mere geographical fact of its existence, and the\r\npeculiar interest therein which is required by our position, perpetuate\r\nthe solemn contract which binds the holders of the territory to respect\r\nour right to freedom of transit across it, and binds us in return to\r\nsafeguard for the Isthmus and the world the exercise of that\r\ninestimable privilege. The true interpretation of the obligations upon\r\nwhich the United States entered in this treaty of 1846 has been given\r\nrepeatedly in the utterances of Presidents and Secretaries of State.\r\nSecretary Cuss in 1858 officially stated the position of this\r\nGovernment as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The progress of events has rendered the interoceanic route across the\r\nnarrow portion of Central America vastly important to the commercial\r\nworld, and especially to the United States, whose possessions extend\r\nalong the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and demand the speediest and\r\neasiest modes of communication. While the rights of sovereignty of the\r\nstates occupying this region should always be respected, we shall\r\nexpect that these rights be exercised in a spirit befitting the\r\noccasion and the wants and circumstances that have arisen. Sovereignty\r\nhas its duties as well as its rights, and none of these local\r\ngovernments, even if administered with more regard to the just demands\r\nof other nations than they have been, would be permitted, in a spirit\r\nof Eastern isolation, to close the gates of intercourse on the great\r\nhighways of the world, and justify the act by the pretension that these\r\navenues of trade and travel belong to them and that they choose to shut\r\nthem, or, what is almost equivalent, to encumber them with such unjust\r\nrelations as would prevent their general use.\"\r\n\r\nSeven years later, in 1865, Mr. Seward in different communications took\r\nthe following position:\r\n\r\n\"The United States have taken and will take no interest in any question\r\nof internal revolution in the State of Panama, or any State of the\r\nUnited States of Colombia, but will maintain a perfect neutrality in\r\nconnection with such domestic altercations. The United States will,\r\nnevertheless, hold themselves ready to protect the transit trade across\r\nthe Isthmus against invasion of either domestic or foreign disturbers\r\nof the peace of the State of Panama. Neither the text nor the spirit of\r\nthe stipulation in that article by which the United States engages to\r\npreserve the neutrality of the Isthmus of Panama, imposes an obligation\r\non this Government to comply with the requisition of the President of\r\nthe United States of Colombia for a force to protect the Isthmus of\r\nPanama from a body of insurgents of that country. The purpose of the\r\nstipulation was to guarantee the Isthmus against seizure or invasion by\r\na foreign power only.\"\r\n\r\nAttorney-General Speed, under date of November 7, 1865, advised\r\nSecretary Seward as follows:\r\n\r\n\"From this treaty it can not be supposed that New Granada invited the\r\nUnited States to become a party to the intestine troubles of that\r\nGovernment, nor did the United States become bound to take sides in the\r\ndomestic broils of New Granada. The United States did guarantee New\r\nGranada in the sovereignty and property over the territory. This was as\r\nagainst other and foreign governments.\"\r\n\r\nFor four hundred years, ever since shortly after the discovery of this\r\nhemisphere, the canal across the Isthmus has been planned. For two\r\nscore years it has been worked at. When made it is to last for the\r\nages. It is to alter the geography of a continent and the trade routes\r\nof the world. We have shown by every treaty we have negotiated or\r\nattempted to negotiate with the peoples in control of the Isthmus and\r\nwith foreign nations in reference thereto our consistent good faith in\r\nobserving our obligations; on the one hand to the peoples of the\r\nIsthmus, and on the other hand to the civilized world whose commercial\r\nrights we are safeguarding and guaranteeing by our action. We have done\r\nour duty to others in letter and in spirit, and we have shown the\r\nutmost forbearance in exacting our own rights.\r\n\r\nLast spring, under the act above referred to, a treaty concluded\r\nbetween the representatives of the Republic of Colombia and of our\r\nGovernment was ratified by the Senate. This treaty was entered into at\r\nthe urgent solicitation of the people of Colombia and after a body of\r\nexperts appointed by our Government especially to go into the matter of\r\nthe routes across the Isthmus had pronounced unanimously in favor of\r\nthe Panama route. In drawing up this treaty every concession was made\r\nto the people and to the Government of Colombia. We were more than just\r\nin dealing with them. Our generosity was such as to make it a serious\r\nquestion whether we had not gone too far in their interest at the\r\nexpense of our own; for in our scrupulous desire to pay all possible\r\nheed, not merely to the real but even to the fancied rights of our\r\nweaker neighbor, who already owed so much to our protection and\r\nforbearance, we yielded in all possible ways to her desires in drawing\r\nup the treaty. Nevertheless the Government of Colombia not merely\r\nrepudiated the treaty, but repudiated it in such manner as to make it\r\nevident by the time the Colombian Congress adjourned that not the\r\nscantiest hope remained of ever getting a satisfactory treaty from\r\nthem. The Government of Colombia made the treaty, and yet when the\r\nColombian Congress was called to ratify it the vote against\r\nratification was unanimous. It does not appear that the Government made\r\nany real effort to secure ratification.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the adjournment of the Congress a revolution broke\r\nout in Panama. The people of Panama had long been discontented with the\r\nRepublic of Colombia, and they had been kept quiet only by the prospect\r\nof the conclusion of the treaty, which was to them a matter of vital\r\nconcern. When it became evident that the treaty was hopelessly lost,\r\nthe people of Panama rose literally as one man. Not a shot was fired by\r\na single man on the Isthmus in the interest of the Colombian\r\nGovernment. Not a life was lost in the accomplishment of the\r\nrevolution. The Colombian troops stationed on the Isthmus, who had long\r\nbeen unpaid, made common cause with the people of Panama, and with\r\nastonishing unanimity the new Republic was started. The duty of the\r\nUnited States in the premises was clear. In strict accordance with the\r\nprinciples laid down by Secretaries Cass and Seward in the official\r\ndocuments above quoted, the United States gave notice that it would\r\npermit the landing of no expeditionary force, the arrival of which\r\nwould mean chaos and destruction along the line of the railroad and of\r\nthe proposed Canal, and an interruption of transit as an inevitable\r\nconsequence. The de facto Government of Panama was recognized in the\r\nfollowing telegram to Mr. Ehrman:\r\n\r\n\"The people of Panama have, by apparently unanimous movement, dissolved\r\ntheir political connection with the Republic of Colombia and resumed\r\ntheir independence. When you are satisfied that a de facto government,\r\nrepublican in form and without substantial opposition from its own\r\npeople, has been established in the State of Panama, you will enter\r\ninto relations with it as the responsible government of the territory\r\nand look to it for all due action to protect the persons and property\r\nof citizens of the United States and to keep open the isthmian transit,\r\nin accordance with the obligations of existing treaties governing the\r\nrelations of the United States to that Territory.\"\r\n\r\nThe Government of Colombia was notified of our action by the following\r\ntelegram to Mr. Beaupre:\r\n\r\n\"The people of Panama having, by an apparently unanimous movement,\r\ndissolved their political connection with the Republic of Colombia and\r\nresumed their independence, and having adopted a Government of their\r\nown, republican in form, with which the Government of the United States\r\nof America has entered into relations, the President of the United\r\nStates, in accordance with the ties of friendship which have so long\r\nand so happily existed between the respective nations, most earnestly\r\ncommends to the Governments of Colombia and of Panama the peaceful and\r\nequitable settlement of all questions at issue between them. He holds\r\nthat he is bound not merely by treaty obligations, but by the interests\r\nof civilization, to see that the peaceful traffic of the world across\r\nthe Isthmus of Panama shall not longer be disturbed by a constant\r\nsuccession of unnecessary and wasteful civil wars.\"\r\n\r\nWhen these events happened, fifty-seven years had elapsed since the\r\nUnited States had entered into its treaty with New Granada. During that\r\ntime the Governments of New Granada and of its successor, Colombia,\r\nhave been in a constant state of flux. The following is a partial list\r\nof the disturbances on the Isthmus of Panama during the period in\r\nquestion as reported to us by our consuls. It is not possible to give a\r\ncomplete list, and some of the reports that speak of \"revolutions\" must\r\nmean unsuccessful revolutions. May 22, 1850.--Outbreak; two Americans\r\nkilled. War vessel demanded to quell outbreak. October,\r\n1850.--Revolutionary plot to bring about independence of the Isthmus.\r\nJuly 22, 1851.--Revolution in four southern provinces. November 14,\r\n1851.--Outbreak at Chagres. Man-of-war requested for Chagres. June 27,\r\n1853.--Insurrection at Bogota, and consequent disturbance on Isthmus.\r\nWar vessel demanded. May 23, 1854--Political disturbances; war vessel\r\nrequested. June 28, 1854.--Attempted revolution.

April, 1867.--Attempt to overthrow\r\nGovernment. August, 1867.--Attempt at revolution. July 5,\r\n1868.--Revolution; provisional government inaugurated. August 29,\r\n1868.--Revolution; provisional government overthrown. April,\r\n1871.--Revolution; followed apparently by counter revolution. April,\r\n1873.--Revolution and civil war which lasted to October, 1875. August,\r\n1876.--Civil war which lasted until April, 1877. July,\r\n1878.--Rebellion. December, 1878.--Revolt. April, 1879.--Revolution.\r\nJune, 1879.--Revolution. March, 1883.--Riot. May, 1883.--Riot. June,\r\n1884.--Revolutionary attempt.

November,\r\n1887.--Disturbance on line of canal. January, 1889.--Riot. January,\r\n1895.--Revolution which lasted until April. March, 1895.--Incendiary\r\nattempt. October, 1899.--Revolution. February, 1900, to July,\r\n1900.--Revolution. January, 1901--Revolution. July,\r\n1901.--Revolutionary disturbances. September, 1901.--City of Colon\r\ntaken by rebels. March, 1902.--Revolutionary disturbances. July,\r\n1902.--Revolution. The above is only a partial list of the revolutions,\r\nrebellions, insurrections, riots, and other outbreaks that have\r\noccurred during the period in question; yet they number 53 for the 57\r\nyears. It will be noted that one of them lasted for nearly three years\r\nbefore it was quelled; another for nearly a year. In short, the\r\nexperience of over half a century has shown Colombia to be utterly\r\nincapable of keeping order on the Isthmus. Only the active interference\r\nof the United States has enabled her to preserve so much as a semblance\r\nof sovereignty. Had it not been for the exercise by the United States\r\nof the police power in her interest, her connection with the Isthmus\r\nwould have been sundered long ago. In 1856, in 1860, in 1873, in 1885,\r\nin 1901, and again in 1902, sailors and marines from United States war\r\nships were forced to land in order to patrol the Isthmus, to protect\r\nlife and property, and to see that the transit across the Isthmus was\r\nkept open. In 1861, in 1862, in 1885, and in 1900, the Colombian\r\nGovernment asked that the United States Government would land troops to\r\nprotect its interests and maintain order on the Isthmus. Perhaps the\r\nmost extraordinary request is that which has just been received and\r\nwhich runs as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Knowing that revolution has already commenced in Panama [an eminent\r\nColombian] says that if the Government of the United States will land\r\ntroops to preserve Colombian sovereignty, and the transit, if requested\r\nby Colombian charge d'affaires, this Government will declare martial\r\nlaw; and, by virtue of vested constitutional authority, when public\r\norder is disturbed, will approve by decree ratification of the canal\r\ntreaty as signed; or, if the Government of the United States prefers,\r\nwill call extra session of the Congress--with new and friendly\r\nmembers--next May to approve the treaty. [An eminent Colombian] has the\r\nperfect confidence of vice-president, he says, and if it became\r\nnecessary will go to the Isthmus or send representatives there to\r\nadjust matters along above lines to the satisfaction of the people\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nThis dispatch is noteworthy from two standpoints. Its offer of\r\nimmediately guaranteeing the treaty to us is in sharp contrast with the\r\npositive and contemptuous refusal of the Congress which has just closed\r\nits sessions to consider favorably such a treaty; it shows that the\r\nGovernment which made the treaty really had absolute control over the\r\nsituation, but did not choose to exercise this control. The dispatch\r\nfurther calls on us to restore order and secure Colombian supremacy in\r\nthe Isthmus from which the Colombian Government has just by its action\r\ndecided to bar us by preventing the construction of the canal.\r\n\r\nThe control, in the interest of the commerce and traffic of the whole\r\ncivilized world, of the means of undisturbed transit across the Isthmus\r\nof Panama has become of transcendent importance to the United States.\r\nWe have repeatedly exercised this control by intervening in the course\r\nof domestic dissension, and by protecting the territory from foreign\r\ninvasion. In 1853 Mr. Everett assured the Peruvian minister that we\r\nshould not hesitate to maintain the neutrality of the Isthmus in the\r\ncase of war between Peru and Colombia. In 1864 Colombia, which has\r\nalways been vigilant to avail itself of its privileges conferred by the\r\ntreaty, expressed its expectation that in the event of war between Peru\r\nand Spain the United States would carry into effect the guaranty of\r\nneutrality. There have been few administrations of the State Department\r\nin which this treaty has not, either by the one side or the other, been\r\nused as a basis of more or less important demands. It was said by Mr.\r\nFish in 1871 that the Department of State had reason to believe that an\r\nattack upon Colombian sovereignty on the Isthmus had, on several\r\noccasions, been averted by warning from this Government. In 1886, when\r\nColombia was under the menace of hostilities from Italy in the Cerruti\r\ncase, Mr. Bayard expressed the serious concern that the United States\r\ncould not but feel, that a European power should resort to force\r\nagainst a sister republic of this hemisphere, as to the sovereign and\r\nuninterrupted use of a part of whose territory we are guarantors under\r\nthe solemn faith of a treaty.\r\n\r\nThe above recital of facts establishes beyond question: First, that the\r\nUnited States has for over half a century patiently and in good faith\r\ncarried out its obligations under the treaty of 1846; second, that when\r\nfor the first time it became possible for Colombia to do anything in\r\nrequital of the services thus repeatedly rendered to it for fifty-seven\r\nyears by the United States, the Colombian Government peremptorily and\r\noffensively refused thus to do its part, even though to do so would\r\nhave been to its advantage and immeasurably to the advantage of the\r\nState of Panama, at that time under its jurisdiction; third, that\r\nthroughout this period revolutions, riots, and factional disturbances\r\nof every kind have occurred one after the other in almost uninterrupted\r\nsuccession, some of them lasting for months and even for years, while\r\nthe central government was unable to put them down or to make peace\r\nwith the rebels; fourth, that these disturbances instead of showing any\r\nsign of abating have tended to grow more numerous and more serious in\r\nthe immediate past; fifth, that the control of Colombia over the\r\nIsthmus of Panama could not be maintained without the armed\r\nintervention and assistance of the United States. In other words, the\r\nGovernment of Colombia, though wholly unable to maintain order on the\r\nIsthmus, has nevertheless declined to ratify a treaty the conclusion of\r\nwhich opened the only chance to secure its own stability and to\r\nguarantee permanent peace on, and the construction of a canal across,\r\nthe Isthmus.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances the Government of the United States would have\r\nbeen guilty of folly and weakness, amounting in their sum to a crime\r\nagainst the Nation, had it acted otherwise than it did when the\r\nrevolution of November 3 last took place in Panama. This great\r\nenterprise of building the interoceanic canal can not be held up to\r\ngratify the whims, or out of respect to the governmental impotence, or\r\nto the even more sinister and evil political peculiarities, of people\r\nwho, though they dwell afar off, yet, against the wish of the actual\r\ndwellers on the Isthmus, assert an unreal supremacy over the territory.\r\nThe possession of a territory fraught with such peculiar capacities as\r\nthe Isthmus in question carries with it obligations to mankind. The\r\ncourse of events has shown that this canal can not be built by private\r\nenterprise, or by any other nation than our own; therefore it must be\r\nbuilt by the United States.\r\n\r\nEvery effort has been made by the Government of the United States to\r\npersuade Colombia to follow a course which was essentially not only to\r\nour interests and to the interests of the world, but to the interests\r\nof Colombia itself. These efforts have failed; and Colombia, by her\r\npersistence in repulsing the advances that have been made, has forced\r\nus, for the sake of our own honor, and of the interest and well-being,\r\nnot merely of our own people, but of the people of the Isthmus of\r\nPanama and the people of the civilized countries of the world, to take\r\ndecisive steps to bring to an end a condition of affairs which had\r\nbecome intolerable. The new Republic of Panama immediately offered to\r\nnegotiate a treaty with us. This treaty I herewith submit. By it our\r\ninterests are better safeguarded than in the treaty with Colombia which\r\nwas ratified by the Senate at its last session. It is better in its\r\nterms than the treaties offered to us by the Republics of Nicaragua and\r\nCosta Rica. At last the right to begin this great undertaking is made\r\navailable. Panama has done her part. All that remains is for the\r\nAmerican Congress to do its part, and forthwith this Republic will\r\nenter upon the execution of a project colossal in its size and of\r\nwell-nigh incalculable possibilities for the good of this country and\r\nthe nations of mankind.\r\n\r\nBy the provisions of the treaty the United States guarantees and will\r\nmaintain the independence of the Republic of Panama. There is granted\r\nto the United States in perpetuity the use, occupation, and control of\r\na strip ten miles wide and extending three nautical miles into the sea\r\nat either terminal, with all lands lying outside of the zone necessary\r\nfor the construction of the canal or for its auxiliary works, and with\r\nthe islands in the Bay of Panama. The cities of Panama and Colon are\r\nnot embraced in the canal zone, but the United States assumes their\r\nsanitation and, in case of need, the maintenance of order therein; the\r\nUnited States enjoys within the granted limits all the rights, power,\r\nand authority which it would possess were it the sovereign of the\r\nterritory to the exclusion of the exercise of sovereign rights by the\r\nRepublic. All railway and canal property rights belonging to Panama and\r\nneeded for the canal pass to the United States, including any property\r\nof the respective companies in the cities of Panama and Colon; the\r\nworks, property, and personnel of the canal and railways are exempted\r\nfrom taxation as well in the cities of Panama and Colon as in the canal\r\nzone and its dependencies. Free immigration of the personnel and\r\nimportation of supplies for the construction and operation of the canal\r\nare granted. Provision is made for the use of military force and the\r\nbuilding of fortifications by the United States for the protection of\r\nthe transit. In other details, particularly as to the acquisition of\r\nthe interests of the New Panama Canal Company and the Panama Railway by\r\nthe United States and the condemnation of private property for the uses\r\nof the canal, the stipulations of the Hay-Herran treaty are closely\r\nfollowed, while the compensation to be given for these enlarged grants\r\nremains the same, being ten millions of dollars payable on exchange of\r\nratifications; and, beginning nine years from that date, an annual\r\npayment of $250,000 during the life of the convention.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nTheodore Roosevelt\r\nDecember 6, 1904\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe Nation continues to enjoy noteworthy prosperity. Such prosperity is\r\nof course primarily due to the high individual average of our\r\ncitizenship, taken together with our great natural resources; but an\r\nimportant factor therein is the working of our long-continued\r\ngovernmental policies. The people have emphatically expressed their\r\napproval of the principles underlying these policies, and their desire\r\nthat these principles be kept substantially unchanged, although of\r\ncourse applied in a progressive spirit to meet changing conditions.\r\n\r\nThe enlargement of scope of the functions of the National Government\r\nrequired by our development as a nation involves, of course, increase\r\nof expense; and the period of prosperity through which the country is\r\npassing justifies expenditures for permanent improvements far greater\r\nthan would be wise in hard times. Battle ships and forts, public\r\nbuildings, and improved waterways are investments which should be made\r\nwhen we have the money; but abundant revenues and a large surplus\r\nalways invite extravagance, and constant care should be taken to guard\r\nagainst unnecessary increase of the ordinary expenses of government.\r\nThe cost of doing Government business should be regulated with the same\r\nrigid scrutiny as the cost of doing a private business.\r\n\r\nIn the vast and complicated mechanism of our modern civilized life the\r\ndominant note is the note of industrialism; and the relations of\r\ncapital and labor, and especially of organized capital and organized\r\nlabor, to each other and to the public at large come second in\r\nimportance only to the intimate questions of family life. Our peculiar\r\nform of government, with its sharp division of authority between the\r\nNation and the several States, has been on the whole far more\r\nadvantageous to our development than a more strongly centralized\r\ngovernment. But it is undoubtedly responsible for much of the\r\ndifficulty of meeting with adequate legislation the new problems\r\npresented by the total change in industrial conditions on this\r\ncontinent during the last half century. In actual practice it has\r\nproved exceedingly difficult, and in many cases impossible, to get\r\nunanimity of wise action among the various States on these subjects.\r\nFrom the very nature of the case this is especially true of the laws\r\naffecting the employment of capital in huge masses.\r\n\r\nWith regard to labor the problem is no less important, but it is\r\nsimpler. As long as the States retain the primary control of the police\r\npower the circumstances must be altogether extreme which require\r\ninterference by the Federal authorities, whether in the way of\r\nsafeguarding the rights of labor or in the way of seeing that wrong is\r\nnot done by unruly persons who shield themselves behind the name of\r\nlabor. If there is resistance to the Federal courts, interference with\r\nthe mails, or interstate commerce, or molestation of Federal property,\r\nor if the State authorities in some crisis which they are unable to\r\nface call for help, then the Federal Government may interfere; but\r\nthough such interference may be caused by a condition of things arising\r\nout of trouble connected with some question of labor, the interference\r\nitself simply takes the form of restoring order without regard to the\r\nquestions which have caused the breach of order--for to keep order is a\r\nprimary duty and in a time of disorder and violence all other questions\r\nsink into abeyance until order has been restored. In the District of\r\nColumbia and in the Territories the Federal law covers the entire field\r\nof government; but the labor question is only acute in populous centers\r\nof commerce, manufactures, or mining. Nevertheless, both in the\r\nenactment and in the enforcement of law the Federal Government within\r\nits restricted sphere should set an example to the State governments,\r\nespecially in a matter so vital as this affecting labor. I believe that\r\nunder modern industrial conditions it is often necessary, and even\r\nwhere not necessary it is yet often wise, that there should be\r\norganization of labor in order better to secure the rights of the\r\nindividual wage-worker. All encouragement should be given to any such\r\norganization so long as it is conducted with a due and decent regard\r\nfor the rights of others. There are in this country some labor unions\r\nwhich have habitually, and other labor unions which have often, been\r\namong the most effective agents in working for good citizenship and for\r\nuplifting the condition of those whose welfare should be closest to our\r\nhearts. But when any labor union seeks improper ends, or seeks to\r\nachieve proper ends by improper means, all good citizens and more\r\nespecially all honorable public servants must oppose the wrongdoing as\r\nresolutely as they would oppose the wrongdoing of any great\r\ncorporation. Of course any violence, brutality, or corruption, should\r\nnot for one moment be tolerated. Wage-workers have an entire right to\r\norganize and by all peaceful and honorable means to endeavor to\r\npersuade their fellows to join with them in organizations. They have a\r\nlegal right, which, according to circumstances, may or may not be a\r\nmoral right, to refuse to work in company with men who decline to join\r\ntheir organizations. They have under no circumstances the right to\r\ncommit violence upon these, whether capitalists or wage-workers, who\r\nrefuse to support their organizations, or who side with those with whom\r\nthey are at odds; for mob rule is intolerable in any form.\r\n\r\nThe wage-workers are peculiarly entitled to the protection and the\r\nencouragement of the law. From the very nature of their occupation\r\nrailroad men, for instance, are liable to be maimed in doing the\r\nlegitimate work of their profession, unless the railroad companies are\r\nrequired by law to make ample provision for their safety. The\r\nAdministration has been zealous in enforcing the existing law for this\r\npurpose. That law should be amended and strengthened. Wherever the\r\nNational Government has power there should be a stringent employer's\r\nliability law, which should apply to the Government itself where the\r\nGovernment is an employer of labor.\r\n\r\nIn my Message to the Fifty-seventh Congress, at its second session, I\r\nurged the passage of an employer's liability law for the District of\r\nColumbia. I now renew that recommendation, and further recommend that\r\nthe Congress appoint a commission to make a comprehensive study of\r\nemployer's liability with the view of extending the provisions of a\r\ngreat and constitutional law to all employments within the scope of\r\nFederal power.\r\n\r\nThe Government has recognized heroism upon the water, and bestows\r\nmedals of honor upon those persons who by extreme and heroic daring\r\nhave endangered their lives in saving, or endeavoring to save, lives\r\nfrom the perils of the sea in the waters over which the United States\r\nhas jurisdiction, or upon an American vessel. This recognition should\r\nbe extended to cover cases of conspicuous bravery and self-sacrifice in\r\nthe saving of life in private employments under the jurisdiction of the\r\nUnited States, and particularly in the land commerce of the Nation.\r\n\r\nThe ever-increasing casualty list upon our railroads is a matter of\r\ngrave public concern, and urgently calls for action by the Congress. In\r\nthe matter of speed and comfort of railway travel our railroads give at\r\nleast as good service as those of any other nation, and there is no\r\nreason why this service should not also be as safe as human ingenuity\r\ncan make it. Many of our leading roads have been foremost in the\r\nadoption of the most approved safeguards for the protection of\r\ntravelers and employees, yet the list of clearly avoidable accidents\r\ncontinues unduly large. The passage of a law requiring the adoption of\r\na block-signal system has been proposed to the Congress. I earnestly\r\nconcur in that recommendation, and would also point out to the Congress\r\nthe urgent need of legislation in the interest of the public safety\r\nlimiting the hours of labor for railroad employees in train service\r\nupon railroads engaged in interstate commerce, and providing that only\r\ntrained and experienced persons be employed in positions of\r\nresponsibility connected with the operation of trains. Of course\r\nnothing can ever prevent accidents caused by human weakness or\r\nmisconduct; and there should be drastic punishment for any railroad\r\nemployee, whether officer or man, who by issuance of wrong orders or by\r\ndisobedience of orders causes disaster. The law of 1901, requiring\r\ninterstate railroads to make monthly reports of all accidents to\r\npassengers and employees on duty, should also be amended so as to\r\nempower the Government to make a personal investigation, through proper\r\nofficers, of all accidents involving loss of life which seem to require\r\ninvestigation, with a requirement that the results of such\r\ninvestigation be made public.\r\n\r\nThe safety-appliance law, as amended by the act of March 2, 1903, has\r\nproved beneficial to railway employees, and in order that its\r\nprovisions may be properly carried out, the force of inspectors\r\nprovided for by appropriation should be largely increased. This service\r\nis analogous to the Steamboat-Inspection Service, and deals with even\r\nmore important interests. It has passed the experimental stage and\r\ndemonstrated its utility, and should receive generous recognition by\r\nthe Congress.\r\n\r\nThere is no objection to employees of the Government forming or\r\nbelonging to unions; but the Government can neither discriminate for\r\nnor discriminate against nonunion men who are in its employment, or who\r\nseek to be employed under it. Moreover, it is a very grave impropriety\r\nfor Government employees to band themselves together for the purpose of\r\nextorting improperly high salaries from the Government. Especially is\r\nthis true of those within the classified service. The letter carriers,\r\nboth municipal and rural, are as a whole an excellent body of public\r\nservants. They should be amply paid. But their payment must be obtained\r\nby arguing their claims fairly and honorably before the Congress, and\r\nnot by banding together for the defeat of those Congressmen who refuse\r\nto give promises which they can not in conscience give. The\r\nAdministration has already taken steps to prevent and punish abuses of\r\nthis nature; but it will be wise for the Congress to supplement this\r\naction by legislation.\r\n\r\nMuch can be done by the Government in labor matters merely by giving\r\npublicity to certain conditions. The Bureau of Labor has done excellent\r\nwork of this kind in many different directions. I shall shortly lay\r\nbefore you in a special message the full report of the investigation of\r\nthe Bureau of Labor into the Colorado mining strike, as this was a\r\nstrike in which certain very evil forces, which are more or less at\r\nwork everywhere under the conditions of modern industrialism, became\r\nstartlingly prominent. It is greatly to be wished that the Department\r\nof Commerce and Labor, through the Labor Bureau, should compile and\r\narrange for the Congress a list of the labor laws of the various\r\nStates, and should be given the means to investigate and report to the\r\nCongress upon the labor conditions in the manufacturing and mining\r\nregions throughout the country, both as to wages, as to hours of labor,\r\nas to the labor of women and children, and as to the effect in the\r\nvarious labor centers of immigration from abroad. In this investigation\r\nespecial attention should be paid to the conditions of child labor and\r\nchild-labor legislation in the several States. Such an investigation\r\nmust necessarily take into account many of the problems with which this\r\nquestion of child labor is connected. These problems can be actually\r\nmet, in most cases, only by the States themselves; but the lack of\r\nproper legislation in one State in such a matter as child labor often\r\nrenders it excessively difficult to establish protective restriction\r\nupon the work in another State having the same industries, so that the\r\nworst tends to drag down the better. For this reason, it would be well\r\nfor the Nation at least to endeavor to secure comprehensive information\r\nas to the conditions of labor of children in the different States. Such\r\ninvestigation and publication by the National Government would tend\r\ntoward the securing of approximately uniform legislation of the proper\r\ncharacter among the several States.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to deal with great corporations the need for the\r\nGovernment to act directly is far greater than in the case of labor,\r\nbecause great corporations can become such only by engaging in\r\ninterstate commerce, and interstate commerce is peculiarly the field of\r\nthe General Government. It is an absurdity to expect to eliminate the\r\nabuses in great corporations by State action. It is difficult to be\r\npatient with an argument that such matters should be left to the States\r\nbecause more than one State pursues the policy of creating on easy\r\nterms corporations which are never operated within that State at all,\r\nbut in other States whose laws they ignore. The National Government\r\nalone can deal adequately with these great corporations. To try to deal\r\nwith them in an intemperate, destructive, or demagogic spirit would, in\r\nall probability, mean that nothing whatever would be accomplished, and,\r\nwith absolute certainty, that if anything were accomplished it would be\r\nof a harmful nature. The American people need to continue to show the\r\nvery qualities that they have shown--that is, moderation, good sense,\r\nthe earnest desire to avoid doing any damage, and yet the quiet\r\ndetermination to proceed, step by step, without halt and without hurry,\r\nin eliminating or at least in minimizing whatever of mischief or evil\r\nthere is to interstate commerce in the conduct of great corporations.\r\nThey are acting in no spirit of hostility to wealth, either individual\r\nor corporate. They are not against the rich man any more than against\r\nthe poor man. On the contrary, they are friendly alike toward rich man\r\nand toward poor man, provided only that each acts in a spirit of\r\njustice and decency toward his fellows. Great corporations are\r\nnecessary, and only men of great and singular mental power can manage\r\nsuch corporations successfully, and such men must have great rewards.\r\nBut these corporations should be managed with due regard to the\r\ninterest of the public as a whole. Where this can be done under the\r\npresent laws it must be done. Where these laws come short others should\r\nbe enacted to supplement them.\r\n\r\nYet we must never forget the determining factor in every kind of work,\r\nof head or hand, must be the man's own good sense, courage, and\r\nkindliness. More important than any legislation is the gradual growth\r\nof a feeling of responsibility and forbearance among capitalists, and\r\nwage-workers alike; a feeling of respect on the part of each man for\r\nthe rights of others; a feeling of broad community of interest, not\r\nmerely of capitalists among themselves, and of wage-workers among\r\nthemselves, but of capitalists and wage-workers in their relations to\r\neach other, and of both in their relations to their fellows who with\r\nthem make up the body politic. There are many captains of industry,\r\nmany labor leaders, who realize this. A recent speech by the president\r\nof one of our great railroad systems to the employees of that system\r\ncontains sound common sense. It rims in part as follows:\r\n\r\n\"It is my belief we can better serve each other, better understand the\r\nman as well as his business, when meeting face to face, exchanging\r\nviews, and realizing from personal contact we serve but one interest,\r\nthat of our mutual prosperity.\r\n\r\n\"Serious misunderstandings can not occur where personal good will\r\nexists and opportunity for personal explanation is present.\r\n\r\n\"In my early business life I had experience with men of affairs of a\r\ncharacter to make me desire to avoid creating a like feeling of\r\nresentment to myself and the interests in my charge, should fortune\r\never place me in authority, and I am solicitous of a measure of\r\nconfidence on the part of the public and our employees that I shall\r\nhope may be warranted by the fairness and good fellowship I intend\r\nshall prevail in our relationship.\r\n\r\n\"But do not feel I am disposed to grant unreasonable requests, spend\r\nthe money of our company unnecessarily or without value received, nor\r\nexpect the days of mistakes are disappearing, or that cause for\r\ncomplaint will not continually occur; simply to correct such abuses as\r\nmay be discovered, to better conditions as fast as reasonably may be\r\nexpected, constantly striving, with varying success, for that\r\nimprovement we all desire, to convince you there is a force at work in\r\nthe right direction, all the time making progress--is the disposition\r\nwith which I have come among you, asking your good will and\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\n\"The day has gone by when a corporation can be handled successfully in\r\ndefiance of the public will, even though that will be unreasonable and\r\nwrong. A public may be led, but not driven, and I prefer to go with it\r\nand shape or modify, in a measure, its opinion, rather than be swept\r\nfrom my bearings, with loss to myself and the interests in my charge.\r\n\r\n\"Violent prejudice exists towards corporate activity and capital today,\r\nmuch of it founded in reason, more in apprehension, and a large measure\r\nis due to the personal traits of arbitrary, unreasonable, incompetent,\r\nand offensive men in positions of authority. The accomplishment of\r\nresults by indirection, the endeavor to thwart the intention, if not\r\nthe expressed letter of the law (the will of the people), a disregard\r\nof the rights of others, a disposition to withhold what is due, to\r\nforce by main strength or inactivity a result not justified, depending\r\nupon the weakness of the claimant and his indisposition to become\r\ninvolved in litigation, has created a sentiment harmful in the extreme\r\nand a disposition to consider anything fair that gives gain to the\r\nindividual at the expense of the company.\r\n\r\n\"If corporations are to continue to do the world's work, as they are\r\nbest fitted to, these qualities in their representatives that have\r\nresulted in the present prejudice against them must be relegated to the\r\nbackground. The corporations must come out into the open and see and be\r\nseen. They must take the public into their confidence and ask for what\r\nthey want, and no more, and be prepared to explain satisfactorily what\r\nadvantage will accrue to the public if they are given their desires;\r\nfor they are permitted to exist not that they may make money solely,\r\nbut that they may effectively serve those from whom they derive their\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\"Publicity, and not secrecy, will win hereafter, and laws be construed\r\nby their intent and not by their letter, otherwise public utilities\r\nwill be owned and operated by the public which created them, even\r\nthough the service be less efficient and the result less satisfactory\r\nfrom a financial standpoint.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Corporations has made careful preliminary investigation\r\nof many important corporations. It will make a special report on the\r\nbeef industry.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Bureau is to accomplish the purposes of its creation\r\nby co-operation, not antagonism; by making constructive legislation,\r\nnot destructive prosecution, the immediate object of its inquiries; by\r\nconservative investigation of law and fact, and by refusal to issue\r\nincomplete and hence necessarily inaccurate reports. Its policy being\r\nthus one of open inquiry into, and not attack upon, business, the\r\nBureau has been able to gain not only the confidence, but, better\r\nstill, the cooperation of men engaged in legitimate business.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau offers to the Congress the means of getting at the cost of\r\nproduction of our various great staples of commerce.\r\n\r\nOf necessity the careful investigation of special corporations will\r\nafford the Commissioner knowledge of certain business facts, the\r\npublication of which might be an improper infringement of private\r\nrights. The method of making public the results of these investigations\r\naffords, under the law, a means for the protection of private rights.\r\nThe Congress will have all facts except such as would give to another\r\ncorporation information which would injure the legitimate business of a\r\ncompetitor and destroy the incentive for individual superiority and\r\nthrift.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau has also made exhaustive examinations into the legal\r\ncondition under which corporate business is carried on in the various\r\nStates; into all judicial decisions on the subject; and into the\r\nvarious systems of corporate taxation in use. I call special attention\r\nto the report of the chief of the Bureau; and I earnestly ask that the\r\nCongress carefully consider the report and recommendations of the\r\nCommissioner on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe business of insurance vitally affects the great mass of the people\r\nof the United States and is national and not local in its application.\r\nIt involves a multitude of transactions among the people of the\r\ndifferent States and between American companies and foreign\r\ngovernments. I urge that the Congress carefully consider whether the\r\npower of the Bureau of Corporations can not constitutionally be\r\nextended to cover interstate transactions in insurance.\r\n\r\nAbove all else, we must strive to keep the highways of commerce open to\r\nall on equal terms; and to do this it is necessary to put a complete\r\nstop to all rebates. Whether the shipper or the railroad is to blame\r\nmakes no difference; the rebate must be stopped, the abuses of the\r\nprivate car and private terminal-track and side-track systems must be\r\nstopped, and the legislation of the Fifty-eighth Congress which\r\ndeclares it to be unlawful for any person or corporation to offer,\r\ngrant, give, solicit, accept, or receive any rebate, concession, or\r\ndiscrimination in respect of the transportation of any property in\r\ninterstate or foreign commerce whereby such property shall by any\r\ndevice whatever be transported at a less rate than that named in the\r\ntariffs published by the carrier must be enforced. For some time after\r\nthe enactment of the Act to Regulate Commerce it remained a mooted\r\nquestion whether that act conferred upon the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission the power, after it had found a challenged rate to be\r\nunreasonable, to declare what thereafter should, prima facie, be the\r\nreasonable maximum rate for the transportation in dispute. The Supreme\r\nCourt finally resolved that question in the negative, so that as the\r\nlaw now stands the Commission simply possess the bare power to denounce\r\na particular rate as unreasonable. While I am of the opinion that at\r\npresent it would be undesirable, if it were not impracticable, finally\r\nto clothe the Commission with general authority to fix railroad rates,\r\nI do believe that, as a fair security to shippers, the Commission\r\nshould be vested with the power, where a given rate has been challenged\r\nand after full hearing found to be unreasonable, to decide, subject to\r\njudicial review, what shall be a reasonable rate to take its place; the\r\nruling of the Commission to take effect immediately, and to obtain\r\nunless and until it is reversed by the court of review. The Government\r\nmust in increasing degree supervise and regulate the workings of the\r\nrailways engaged in interstate commerce; and such increased supervision\r\nis the only alternative to an increase of the present evils on the one\r\nhand or a still more radical policy on the other. In my judgment the\r\nmost important legislative act now needed as regards the regulation of\r\ncorporations is this act to confer on the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission the power to revise rates and regulations, the revised rate\r\nto at once go into effect, and stay in effect unless and until the\r\ncourt of review reverses it.\r\n\r\nSteamship companies engaged in interstate commerce and protected in our\r\ncoastwise trade should be held to a strict observance of the interstate\r\ncommerce act.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing the set plan to make the city of Washington an example to\r\nother American municipalities several points should be kept in mind by\r\nthe legislators. In the first place, the people of this country should\r\nclearly understand that no amount of industrial prosperity, and above\r\nall no leadership in international industrial competition, can in any\r\nway atone for the sapping of the vitality of those who are usually\r\nspoken of as the working classes. The farmers, the mechanics, the\r\nskilled and unskilled laborers, the small shop keepers, make up the\r\nbulk of the population of any country; and upon their well-being,\r\ngeneration after generation, the well-being of the country and the race\r\ndepends. Rapid development in wealth and industrial leadership is a\r\ngood thing, but only if it goes hand in hand with improvement, and not\r\ndeterioration, physical and moral. The over-crowding of cities and the\r\ndraining of country districts are unhealthy and even dangerous symptoms\r\nin our modern life. We should not permit overcrowding in cities. In\r\ncertain European cities it is provided by law that the population of\r\ntowns shall not be allowed to exceed a very limited density for a given\r\narea, so that the increase in density must be continually pushed back\r\ninto a broad zone around the center of the town, this zone having great\r\navenues or parks within it. The death-rate statistics show a terrible\r\nincrease in mortality, and especially in infant mortality, in\r\novercrowded tenements. The poorest families in tenement houses live in\r\none room, and it appears that in these one-room tenements the average\r\ndeath rate for a number of given cities at home and abroad is about\r\ntwice what it is in a two-room tenement, four times what it is in a\r\nthree-room tenement, and eight times what it is in a tenement\r\nconsisting of four rooms or over. These figures vary somewhat for\r\ndifferent cities, but they approximate in each city those given above;\r\nand in all cases the increase of mortality, and especially of infant\r\nmortality, with the decrease in the number of rooms used by the family\r\nand with the consequent overcrowding is startling. The slum exacts a\r\nheavy total of death from those who dwell therein; and this is the case\r\nnot merely in the great crowded slums of high buildings in New York and\r\nChicago, but in the alley slums of Washington. In Washington people can\r\nnot afford to ignore the harm that this causes. No Christian and\r\ncivilized community can afford to show a happy-go-lucky lack of concern\r\nfor the youth of to-day; for, if so, the community will have to pay a\r\nterrible penalty of financial burden and social degradation in the\r\nto-morrow. There should be severe child-labor and factory-inspection\r\nlaws. It is very desirable that married women should not work in\r\nfactories. The prime duty of the man is to work, to be the breadwinner;\r\nthe prime duty of the woman is to be the mother, the housewife. All\r\nquestions of tariff and finance sink into utter insignificance when\r\ncompared with the tremendous, the vital importance of trying to shape\r\nconditions so that these two duties of the man and of the woman can be\r\nfulfilled under reasonably favorable circumstances. If a race does not\r\nhave plenty of children, or if the children do not grow up, or if when\r\nthey grow up they are unhealthy in body and stunted or vicious in mind,\r\nthen that race is decadent, and no heaping up of wealth, no splendor of\r\nmomentary material prosperity, can avail in any degree as offsets.  The\r\nCongress has the same power of legislation for the District of Columbia\r\nwhich the State legislatures have for the various States. The problems\r\nincident to our highly complex modern industrial civilization, with its\r\nmanifold and perplexing tendencies both for good and for evil, are far\r\nless sharply accentuated in the city of Washington than in most other\r\ncities. For this very reason it is easier to deal with the various\r\nphases of these problems in Washington, and the District of Columbia\r\ngovernment should be a model for the other municipal governments of the\r\nNation, in all such matters as supervision of the housing of the poor,\r\nthe creation of small parks in the districts inhabited by the poor, in\r\nlaws affecting labor, in laws providing for the taking care of the\r\nchildren, in truant laws, and in providing schools.\r\n\r\nIn the vital matter of taking care of children, much advantage could be\r\ngained by a careful study of what has been accomplished in such States\r\nas Illinois and Colorado by the juvenile courts. The work of the\r\njuvenile court is really a work of character building. It is now\r\ngenerally recognized that young boys and young girls who go wrong\r\nshould not be treated as criminals, not even necessarily as needing\r\nreformation, but rather as needing to have their characters formed, and\r\nfor this end to have them tested and developed by a system of\r\nprobation. Much admirable work has been done in many of our\r\nCommonwealths by earnest men and women who have made a special study of\r\nthe needs of those classes of children which furnish the greatest\r\nnumber of juvenile offenders, and therefore the greatest number of\r\nadult offenders; and by their aid, and by profiting by the experiences\r\nof the different States and cities in these matters, it would be easy\r\nto provide a good code for the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nSeveral considerations suggest the need for a systematic investigation\r\ninto and improvement of housing conditions in Washington. The hidden\r\nresidential alleys are breeding grounds of vice and disease, and should\r\nbe opened into minor streets. For a number of years influential\r\ncitizens have joined with the District Commissioners in the vain\r\nendeavor to secure laws permitting the condemnation of insanitary\r\ndwellings. The local death rates, especially from preventable diseases,\r\nare so unduly high as to suggest that the exceptional wholesomeness of\r\nWashington's better sections is offset by bad conditions in her poorer\r\nneighborhoods. A special \"Commission on Housing and Health Conditions\r\nin the National Capital\" would not only bring about the reformation of\r\nexisting evils, but would also formulate an appropriate building code\r\nto protect the city from mammoth brick tenements and other evils which\r\nthreaten to develop here as they have in other cities. That the\r\nNation's Capital should be made a model for other municipalities is an\r\nideal which appeals to all patriotic citizens everywhere, and such a\r\nspecial Commission might map out and organize the city's future\r\ndevelopment in lines of civic social service, just as Major L'Enfant\r\nand the recent Park Commission planned the arrangement of her streets\r\nand parks.\r\n\r\nIt is mortifying to remember that Washington has no compulsory school\r\nattendance law and that careful inquiries indicate the habitual absence\r\nfrom school of some twenty per cent of all children between the ages of\r\neight and fourteen. It must be evident to all who consider the problems\r\nof neglected child life or the benefits of compulsory education in\r\nother cities that one of the most urgent needs of the National Capital\r\nis a law requiring the school attendance of all children, this law to\r\nbe enforced by attendance agents directed by the board of education.\r\n\r\nPublic play grounds are necessary means for the development of\r\nwholesome citizenship in modern cities. It is important that the work\r\ninaugurated here through voluntary efforts should be taken up and\r\nextended through Congressional appropriation of funds sufficient to\r\nequip and maintain numerous convenient small play grounds upon land\r\nwhich can be secured without purchase or rental. It is also desirable\r\nthat small vacant places be purchased and reserved as small-park play\r\ngrounds in densely settled sections of the city which now have no\r\npublic open spaces and are destined soon to be built up solidly. All\r\nthese needs should be met immediately. To meet them would entail\r\nexpenses; but a corresponding saving could be made by stopping the\r\nbuilding of streets and levelling of ground for purposes largely\r\nspeculative in outlying parts of the city.\r\n\r\nThere are certain offenders, whose criminality takes the shape of\r\nbrutality and cruelty towards the weak, who need a special type of\r\npunishment. The wife-beater, for example, is inadequately punished by\r\nimprisonment; for imprisonment may often mean nothing to him, while it\r\nmay cause hunger and want to the wife and children who have been the\r\nvictims of his brutality. Probably some form of corporal punishment\r\nwould be the most adequate way of meeting this kind of crime.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture has grown into an educational institution\r\nwith a faculty of two thousand specialists making research into all the\r\nsciences of production. The Congress appropriates, directly and\r\nindirectly, six millions of dollars annually to carry on this work. It\r\nreaches every State and Territory in the Union and the islands of the\r\nsea lately come under our flag. Co-operation is had with the State\r\nexperiment stations, and with many other institutions and individuals.\r\nThe world is carefully searched for new varieties of grains, fruits,\r\ngrasses, vegetables, trees, and shrubs, suitable to various localities\r\nin our country; and marked benefit to our producers has resulted.\r\n\r\nThe activities of our age in lines of research have reached the tillers\r\nof the soil and inspired them with ambition to know more of the\r\nprinciples that govern the forces of nature with which they have to\r\ndeal. Nearly half of the people of this country devote their energies\r\nto growing things from the soil. Until a recent date little has been\r\ndone to prepare these millions for their life work. In most lines of\r\nhuman activity college-trained men are the leaders. The farmer had no\r\nopportunity for special training until the Congress made provision for\r\nit forty years ago. During these years progress has been made and\r\nteachers have been prepared. Over five thousand students are in\r\nattendance at our State agricultural colleges. The Federal Government\r\nexpends ten millions of dollars annually toward this education and for\r\nresearch in Washington and in the several States and Territories. The\r\nDepartment of Agriculture has given facilities for post-graduate work\r\nto five hundred young men during the last seven years, preparing them\r\nfor advance lines of work in the Department and in the State\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe facts concerning meteorology and its relations to plant and animal\r\nlife are being systematically inquired into. Temperature and moisture\r\nare controlling factors in all agricultural operations. The seasons of\r\nthe cyclones of the Caribbean Sea and their paths are being forecasted\r\nwith increasing accuracy. The cold winds that come from the north are\r\nanticipated and their times and intensity told to farmers, gardeners,\r\nand fruiterers in all southern localities.\r\n\r\nWe sell two hundred and fifty million dollars' worth of animals and\r\nanimal products to foreign countries every year, in addition to\r\nsupplying our own people more cheaply and abundantly than any other\r\nnation is able to provide for its people. Successful manufacturing\r\ndepends primarily on cheap food, which accounts to a considerable\r\nextent for our growth in this direction. The Department of Agriculture,\r\nby careful inspection of meats, guards the health of our people and\r\ngives clean bills of health to deserving exports; it is prepared to\r\ndeal promptly with imported diseases of animals, and maintain the\r\nexcellence of our flocks and herds in this respect. There should be an\r\nannual census of the live stock of the Nation.\r\n\r\nWe sell abroad about six hundred million dollars' worth of plants and\r\ntheir products every year. Strenuous efforts are being made to import\r\nfrom foreign countries such grains as are suitable to our varying\r\nlocalities. Seven years ago we bought three-fourths of our rice; by\r\nhelping the rice growers on the Gulf coast to secure seeds from the\r\nOrient suited to their conditions, and by giving them adequate\r\nprotection, they now supply home demand and export to the islands of\r\nthe Caribbean Sea and to other rice-growing countries. Wheat and other\r\ngrains have been imported from light-rainfall countries to our lands in\r\nthe West and Southwest that have not grown crops because of light\r\nprecipitation, resulting in an extensive addition to our cropping area\r\nand our home-making territory that can not be irrigated. Ten million\r\nbushels of first-class macaroni wheat were grown from these\r\nexperimental importations last year. Fruits suitable to our soils and\r\nclimates are being imported from all the countries of the Old\r\nWorld--the fig from Turkey, the almond from Spain, the date from\r\nAlgeria, the mango from India. We are helping our fruit growers to get\r\ntheir crops into European markets by studying methods of preservation\r\nthrough refrigeration, packing, and handling, which have been quite\r\nsuccessful. We are helping our hop growers by importing varieties that\r\nripen earlier and later than the kinds they have been raising, thereby\r\nlengthening the harvesting season. The cotton crop of the country is\r\nthreatened with root rot, the bollworm, and the boll weevil. Our\r\npathologists will find immune varieties that will resist the root\r\ndisease, and the bollworm can be dealt with, but the boll weevil is a\r\nserious menace to the cotton crop. It is a Central American insect that\r\nhas become acclimated in Texas and has done great damage. A scientist\r\nof the Department of Agriculture has found the weevil at home in\r\nGuatemala being kept in check by an ant, which has been brought to our\r\ncotton fields for observation. It is hoped that it may serve a good\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe soils of the country are getting attention from the farmer's\r\nstandpoint, and interesting results are following. We have duplicates\r\nof the soils that grow the wrapper tobacco in Sumatra and the filler\r\ntobacco in Cuba. It will be only a question of time when the large\r\namounts paid to these countries will be paid to our own people. The\r\nreclamation of alkali lands is progressing, to give object lessons to\r\nour people in methods by which worthless lands may be made productive.\r\n\r\nThe insect friends and enemies of the farmer are getting attention. The\r\nenemy of the San Jose scale was found near the Great Wall of China, and\r\nis now cleaning up all our orchards. The fig-fertilizing insect\r\nimported from Turkey has helped to establish an industry in California\r\nthat amounts to from fifty to one hundred tons of dried figs annually,\r\nand is extending over the Pacific coast. A parasitic fly from South\r\nAfrica is keeping in subjection the black scale, the worst pest of the\r\norange and lemon industry in California.\r\n\r\nCareful preliminary work is being done towards producing our own silk.\r\nThe mulberry is being distributed in large numbers, eggs are being\r\nimported and distributed, improved reels were imported from Europe last\r\nyear, and two expert reelers were brought to Washington to reel the\r\ncrop of cocoons and teach the art to our own people.\r\n\r\nThe crop-reporting system of the Department of Agriculture is being\r\nbrought closer to accuracy every year. It has two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand reporters selected from people in eight vocations in life. It\r\nhas arrangements with most European countries for interchange of\r\nestimates, so that our people may know as nearly as possible with what\r\nthey must compete.\r\n\r\nDuring the two and a half years that have elapsed since the passage of\r\nthe reclamation act rapid progress has been made in the surveys and\r\nexaminations of the opportunities for reclamation in the thirteen\r\nStates and three Territories of the arid West. Construction has already\r\nbeen begun on the largest and most important of the irrigation works,\r\nand plans are being completed for works which will utilize the funds\r\nnow available. The operations are being carried on by the Reclamation\r\nService, a corps of engineers selected through competitive\r\ncivil-service examinations. This corps includes experienced consulting\r\nand constructing engineers as well as various experts in mechanical and\r\nlegal matters, and is composed largely of men who have spent most of\r\ntheir lives in practical affairs connected with irrigation. The larger\r\nproblems have been solved and it now remains to execute with care,\r\neconomy, and thoroughness the work which has been laid out. All\r\nimportant details are being carefully considered by boards of\r\nconsulting engineers, selected for their thorough knowledge and\r\npractical experience. Each project is taken up on the ground by\r\ncompetent men and viewed from the standpoint of the creation of\r\nprosperous homes, and of promptly refunding to the Treasury the cost of\r\nconstruction. The reclamation act has been found to be remarkably\r\ncomplete and effective, and so broad in its provisions that a wide\r\nrange of undertakings has been possible under it. At the same time,\r\neconomy is guaranteed by the fact that the funds must ultimately be\r\nreturned to be used over again.\r\n\r\nIt is the cardinal principle of the forest-reserve policy of this\r\nAdministration that the reserves are for use. Whatever interferes with\r\nthe use of their resources is to be avoided by every possible means.\r\nBut these resources must be used in such a way as to make them\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\nThe forest policy of the Government is just now a subject of vivid\r\npublic interest throughout the West and to the people of the United\r\nStates in general. The forest reserves themselves are of extreme value\r\nto the present as well as to the future welfare of all the western\r\npublic-land States. They powerfully affect the use and disposal of the\r\npublic lands. They are of special importance because they preserve the\r\nwater supply and the supply of timber for domestic purposes, and so\r\npromote settlement under the reclamation act. Indeed, they are\r\nessential to the welfare of every one of the great interests of the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nForest reserves are created for two principal purposes. The first is to\r\npreserve the water supply. This is their most important use. The\r\nprincipal users of the water thus preserved are irrigation ranchers and\r\nsettlers, cities and towns to whom their municipal water supplies are\r\nof the very first importance, users and furnishers of water power, and\r\nthe users of water for domestic, manufacturing, mining, and other\r\npurposes. All these are directly dependent upon the forest reserves.\r\n\r\nThe second reason for which forest reserves are created is to preserve\r\nthe timber supply for various classes of wood users. Among the more\r\nimportant of these are settlers under the reclamation act and other\r\nacts, for whom a cheap and accessible supply of timber for domestic\r\nuses is absolutely necessary; miners and prospectors, who are in\r\nserious danger of losing their timber supply by fire or through export\r\nby lumber companies when timber lands adjacent to their mines pass into\r\nprivate ownership; lumbermen, transportation companies, builders, and\r\ncommercial interests in general.\r\n\r\nAlthough the wisdom of creating forest reserves is nearly everywhere\r\nheartily recognized, yet in a few localities there has been\r\nmisunderstanding and complaint. The following statement is therefore\r\ndesirable:\r\n\r\nThe forest reserve policy can be successful only when it has the full\r\nsupport of the people of the West. It can not safely, and should not in\r\nany case, be imposed upon them against their will. But neither can we\r\naccept the views of those whose only interest in the forest is\r\ntemporary; who are anxious to reap what they have not sown and then\r\nmove away, leaving desolation behind them. On the contrary, it is\r\neverywhere and always the interest of the permanent settler and the\r\npermanent business man, the man with a stake in the country, which must\r\nbe considered and which must decide.\r\n\r\nThe making of forest reserves within railroad and wagon-road land-grant\r\nlimits will hereafter, as for the past three years, be so managed as to\r\nprevent the issue, under the act of June 4, 1897, of base for exchange\r\nor lieu selection (usually called scrip). In all cases where forest\r\nreserves within areas covered by land grants appear to be essential to\r\nthe prosperity of settlers, miners, or others, the Government lands\r\nwithin such proposed forest reserves will, as in the recent past, be\r\nwithdrawn from sale or entry pending the completion of such\r\nnegotiations with the owners of the land grants as will prevent the\r\ncreation of so-called scrip.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly the custom to make forest reserves without first\r\ngetting definite and detailed information as to the character of land\r\nand timber within their boundaries. This method of action often\r\nresulted in badly chosen boundaries and consequent injustice to\r\nsettlers and others. Therefore this Administration adopted the present\r\nmethod of first withdrawing the land from disposal, followed by careful\r\nexamination on the ground and the preparation of detailed maps and\r\ndescriptions, before any forest reserve is created.\r\n\r\nI have repeatedly called attention to the confusion which exists in\r\nGovernment forest matters because the work is scattered among three\r\nindependent organizations. The United States is the only one of the\r\ngreat nations in which the forest work of the Government is not\r\nconcentrated under one department, in consonance with the plainest\r\ndictates of good administration and common sense. The present\r\narrangement is bad from every point of view. Merely to mention it is to\r\nprove that it should be terminated at once. As I have repeatedly\r\nrecommended, all the forest work of the Government should be\r\nconcentrated in the Department of Agriculture, where the larger part of\r\nthat work is already done, where practically all of the trained\r\nforesters of the Government are employed, where chiefly in Washington\r\nthere is comprehensive first-class knowledge of the problems of the\r\nreserves acquired on the ground, where all problems relating to growth\r\nfrom the soil are already gathered, and where all the sciences\r\nauxiliary to forestry are at hand for prompt and effective\r\nco-operation. These reasons are decisive in themselves, but it should\r\nbe added that the great organizations of citizens whose interests are\r\naffected by the forest-reserves, such as the National Live Stock\r\nAssociation, the National Wool Growers' Association, the American\r\nMining Congress, the national Irrigation Congress, and the National\r\nBoard of Trade, have uniformly, emphatically, and most of them\r\nrepeatedly, expressed themselves in favor of placing all Government\r\nforest work in the Department of Agriculture because of the peculiar\r\nadaptation of that Department for it. It is true, also, that the forest\r\nservices of nearly all the great nations of the world are under the\r\nrespective departments of agriculture, while in but two of the smaller\r\nnations and in one colony are they under the department of the\r\ninterior. This is the result of long and varied experience and it\r\nagrees fully with the requirements of good administration in our own\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThe creation of a forest service in the Department of Agriculture will\r\nhave for its important results:\r\n\r\nFirst. A better handling of all forest work; because it will be under a\r\nsingle head, and because the vast and indispensable experience of the\r\nDepartment in all matters pertaining to the forest reserves, to\r\nforestry in general, and to other forms of production from the soil,\r\nwill be easily and rapidly accessible.\r\n\r\nSecond. The reserves themselves, being handled from the point of view\r\nof the man in the field, instead of the man in the office, will be more\r\neasily and more widely useful to the people of the West than has been\r\nthe case hitherto.\r\n\r\nThird. Within a comparatively short time the reserves will become\r\nself-supporting. This is important, because continually and rapidly\r\nincreasing appropriations will be necessary for the proper care of this\r\nexceedingly important interest of the Nation, and they can and should\r\nhe offset by returns from the National forests. Under similar\r\ncircumstances the forest possessions of other great nations form an\r\nimportant source of revenue to their governments.\r\n\r\nEvery administrative officer concerned is convinced of the necessity\r\nfor the proposed consolidation of forest work in the Department of\r\nAgriculture, and I myself have urged it more than once in former\r\nmessages. Again I commend it to the early and favorable consideration\r\nof the Congress. The interests of the Nation at large and of the West\r\nin particular have suffered greatly because of the delay.\r\n\r\nI call the attention of the Congress again to the report and\r\nrecommendation of the Commission on the Public Lands forwarded by me to\r\nthe second session of the present Congress. The Commission has\r\nprosecuted its investigations actively during the past season, and a\r\nsecond report is now in an advanced stage of preparation.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the work of the forest reserves I desire again to\r\nurge upon the Congress the importance of authorizing the President to\r\nset aside certain portions of these reserves or other public lands as\r\ngame refuges for the preservation of the bison, the wapiti, and other\r\nlarge beasts once so abundant in our woods and mountains and on our\r\ngreat plains, and now tending toward extinction. Every support should\r\nbe given to the authorities of the Yellowstone Park in their successful\r\nefforts at preserving the large creatures therein; and at very little\r\nexpense portions of the public domain in other regions which are wholly\r\nunsuited to agricultural settlement could be similarly utilized. We owe\r\nit to future generations to keep alive the noble and beautiful\r\ncreatures which by their presence add such distinctive character to the\r\nAmerican wilderness. The limits of the Yellowstone Park should be\r\nextended southwards. The Canyon of the Colorado should be made a\r\nnational park; and the national-park system should include the Yosemite\r\nand as many as possible of the groves of giant trees in California.\r\n\r\nThe veterans of the Civil War have a claim upon the Nation such as no\r\nother body of our citizens possess. The Pension Bureau has never in its\r\nhistory been managed in a more satisfactory manner than is now the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the Indians toward civilization, though not rapid, is\r\nperhaps all that could be hoped for in view of the circumstances.\r\nWithin the past year many tribes have shown, in a degree greater than\r\never before, an appreciation of the necessity of work. This changed\r\nattitude is in part due to the policy recently pursued of reducing the\r\namount of subsistence to the Indians, and thus forcing them, through\r\nsheer necessity, to work for a livelihood. The policy, though severe,\r\nis a useful one, but it is to be exercised only with judgment and with\r\na full understanding of the conditions which exist in each community\r\nfor which it is intended. On or near the Indian reservations there is\r\nusually very little demand for labor, and if the Indians are to earn\r\ntheir living and when work can not be furnished from outside (which is\r\nalways preferable), then it must be furnished by the Government.\r\nPractical instruction of this kind would in a few years result in the\r\nforming of habits of regular industry, which would render the Indian a\r\nproducer and would effect a great reduction in the cost of his\r\nmaintenance.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly declared that the slow advance of the Indians is due to\r\nthe unsatisfactory character of the men appointed to take immediate\r\ncharge of them, and to some extent this is true. While the standard of\r\nthe employees in the Indian Service shows great improvement over that\r\nof bygone years, and while actual corruption or flagrant dishonesty is\r\nnow the rare exception, it is nevertheless the fact that the salaries\r\npaid Indian agents are not large enough to attract the best men to that\r\nfield of work. To achieve satisfactory results the official in charge\r\nof an Indian tribe should possess the high qualifications which are\r\nrequired in the manager of a large business, but only in exceptional\r\ncases is it possible to secure men of such a type for these positions.\r\nMuch better service, however, might be obtained from those now holding\r\nthe places were it practicable to get out of them the best that is in\r\nthem, and this should be done by bringing them constantly into closer\r\ntouch with their superior officers. An agent who has been content to\r\ndraw his salary, giving in return the least possible equivalent in\r\neffort and service, may, by proper treatment, by suggestion and\r\nencouragement, or persistent urging, be stimulated to greater effort\r\nand induced to take a more active personal interest in his work.\r\n\r\nUnder existing conditions an Indian agent in the distant West may be\r\nwholly out of touch with the office of the Indian Bureau. He may very\r\nwell feel that no one takes a personal interest in him or his efforts.\r\nCertain routine duties in the way of reports and accounts are required\r\nof him, but there is no one with whom he may intelligently consult on\r\nmatters vital to his work, except after long delay. Such a man would be\r\ngreatly encouraged and aided by personal contact with some one whose\r\ninterest in Indian affairs and whose authority in the Indian Bureau\r\nwere greater than his own, and such contact would be certain to arouse\r\nand constantly increase the interest he takes in his work.\r\n\r\nThe distance which separates the agents--the workers in the field--from\r\nthe Indian Office in Washington is a chief obstacle to Indian progress.\r\nWhatever shall more closely unite these two branches of the Indian\r\nService, and shall enable them to co-operate more heartily and more\r\neffectively, will be for the increased efficiency of the work and the\r\nbetterment of the race for whose improvement the Indian Bureau was\r\nestablished. The appointment of a field assistant to the Commissioner\r\nof Indian Affairs would be certain to insure this good end. Such an\r\nofficial, if possessed of the requisite energy and deep interest in the\r\nwork, would be a most efficient factor in bringing into closer\r\nrelationship and a more direct union of effort the Bureau in Washington\r\nand its agents in the field; and with the co-operation of its branches\r\nthus secured the Indian Bureau would, in measure fuller than ever\r\nbefore, lift up the savage toward that self-help and self-reliance\r\nwhich constitute the man.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 there will be held at Hampton Roads the tricentennial\r\ncelebration of the settlement at Jamestown, Virginia, with which the\r\nhistory of what has now become the United States really begins. I\r\ncommend this to your favorable consideration. It is an event of prime\r\nhistoric significance, in which all the people of the United States\r\nshould feel, and should show, great and general interest.\r\n\r\nIn the Post-Office Department the service has increased in efficiency,\r\nand conditions as to revenue and expenditure continue satisfactory. The\r\nincrease of revenue during the year was $9,358,181.10, or 6.9 per cent,\r\nthe total receipts amounting to $143,382,624.34. The expenditures were\r\n$152,362,116.70, an increase of about 9 per cent over the previous\r\nyear, being thus $8,979,492.36 in excess of the current revenue.\r\nIncluded in these expenditures was a total appropriation of\r\n$152,956,637.35 for the continuation and extension of the rural\r\nfree-delivery service, which was an increase of $4,902,237.35 over the\r\namount expended for this purpose in the preceding fiscal year. Large as\r\nthis expenditure has been the beneficent results attained in extending\r\nthe free distribution of mails to the residents of rural districts have\r\njustified the wisdom of the outlay. Statistics brought down to the 1st\r\nof October, 1904, show that on that date there were 27,138 rural routes\r\nestablished, serving approximately 12,000,000 of people in rural\r\ndistricts remote from post-offices, and that there were pending at that\r\ntime 3,859 petitions for the establishment of new rural routes.\r\nUnquestionably some part of the general increase in receipts is due to\r\nthe increased postal facilities which the rural service has afforded.\r\nThe revenues have also been aided greatly by amendments in the\r\nclassification of mail matter, and the curtailment of abuses of the\r\nsecond-class mailing privilege. The average increase in the volume of\r\nmail matter for the period beginning with 1902 and ending June, 1905\r\n(that portion for 1905 being estimated), is 40.47 per cent, as compared\r\nwith 25.46 per cent for the period immediately preceding, and 15.92 for\r\nthe four-year period immediately preceding that.\r\n\r\nOur consular system needs improvement. Salaries should be substituted\r\nfor fees, and the proper classification, grading, and transfer of\r\nconsular officers should be provided. I am not prepared to say that a\r\ncompetitive system of examinations for appointment would work well; but\r\nby law it should be provided that consuls should be familiar, according\r\nto places for which they apply, with the French, German, or Spanish\r\nlanguages, and should possess acquaintance with the resources of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe collection of objects of art contemplated in section 5586 of the\r\nRevised Statutes should be designated and established as a National\r\nGallery of Art; and the Smithsonian Institution should be authorized to\r\naccept any additions to said collection that may be received by gift,\r\nbequest, or devise.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to enact a proper National quarantine law. It is most\r\nundesirable that a State should on its own initiative enforce\r\nquarantine regulations which are in effect a restriction upon\r\ninterstate and international commerce. The question should properly be\r\nassumed by the Government alone. The Surgeon-General of the National\r\nPublic Health and Marine-Hospital Service has repeatedly and\r\nconvincingly set forth the need for such legislation.\r\n\r\nI call your attention to the great extravagance in printing and binding\r\nGovernment publications, and especially to the fact that altogether too\r\nmany of these publications are printed. There is a constant tendency to\r\nincrease their number and their volume. It is an understatement to say\r\nthat no appreciable harm would be caused by, and substantial benefit\r\nwould accrue from, decreasing the amount of printing now done by at\r\nleast one-half. Probably the great majority of the Government reports\r\nand the like now printed are never read at all, and furthermore the\r\nprinting of much of the material contained in many of the remaining\r\nones serves no useful purpose whatever.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Congress should be especially given to the\r\ncurrency question, and that the standing committees on the matter in\r\nthe two Houses charged with the duty, take up the matter of our\r\ncurrency and see whether it is not possible to secure an agreement in\r\nthe business world for bettering the system; the committees should\r\nconsider the question of the retirement of the greenbacks and the\r\nproblem of securing in our currency such elasticity as is consistent\r\nwith safety. Every silver dollar should be made by law redeemable in\r\ngold at the option of the holder.\r\n\r\nI especially commend to your immediate attention the encouragement of\r\nour merchant marine by appropriate legislation.\r\n\r\nThe growing importance of the Orient as a field for American exports\r\ndrew from my predecessor, President McKinley, an urgent request for its\r\nspecial consideration by the Congress. In his message of 1898 he\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n\"In this relation, as showing the peculiar volume and value of our\r\ntrade with China and the peculiarly favorable conditions which exist\r\nfor their expansion in the normal course of trade, I refer to the\r\ncommunication addressed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives\r\nby the Secretary of the Treasury on the 14th of last June, with its\r\naccompanying letter of the Secretary of State, recommending an\r\nappropriation for a commission to study the industrial and commercial\r\nconditions in the Chinese Empire and to report as to the opportunities\r\nfor and the obstacles to the enlargement of markets in China for the\r\nraw products and manufactures of the United States. Action was not\r\ntaken thereon during the last session. I cordially urge that the\r\nrecommendation receive at your hands the consideration which its\r\nimportance and timeliness merit.\"\r\n\r\nIn his annual message of 1889 he again called attention to this\r\nrecommendation, quoting it, and stated further:\r\n\r\n\"I now renew this recommendation, as the importance of the subject has\r\nsteadily grown since it was first submitted to you, and no time should\r\nbe lost in studying for ourselves the resources of this great field for\r\nAmerican trade and enterprise.\"\r\n\r\nThe importance of securing proper information and data with a view to\r\nthe enlargement of our trade with Asia is undiminished. Our consular\r\nrepresentatives in China have strongly urged a place for permanent\r\ndisplay of American products in some prominent trade center of that\r\nEmpire, under Government control and management, as an effective means\r\nof advancing our export trade therein. I call the attention of the\r\nCongress to the desirability of carrying out these suggestions.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the questions of immigration and naturalization it is\r\nindispensable to keep certain facts ever before the minds of those who\r\nshare in enacting the laws. First and foremost, let us remember that\r\nthe question of being a good American has nothing whatever to do with a\r\nman's birthplace any more than it has to do with his creed. In every\r\ngeneration from the time this Government was founded men of foreign\r\nbirth have stood in the very foremost rank of good citizenship, and\r\nthat not merely in one but in every field of American activity; while\r\nto try to draw a distinction between the man whose parents came to this\r\ncountry and the man whose ancestors came to it several generations back\r\nis a mere absurdity. Good Americanism is a matter of heart, of\r\nconscience, of lofty aspiration, of sound common sense, but not of\r\nbirthplace or of creed. The medal of honor, the highest prize to be won\r\nby those who serve in the Army and the Navy of the United States\r\ndecorates men born here, and it also decorates men born in Great\r\nBritain and Ireland, in Germany, in Scandinavia, in France, and\r\ndoubtless in other countries also. In the field of statesmanship, in\r\nthe field of business, in the field of philanthropic endeavor, it is\r\nequally true that among the men of whom we are most proud as Americans\r\nno distinction whatever can be drawn between those who themselves or\r\nwhose parents came over in sailing ship or steamer from across the\r\nwater and those whose ancestors stepped ashore into the wooded\r\nwilderness at Plymouth or at the mouth of the Hudson, the Delaware, or\r\nthe James nearly three centuries ago. No fellow-citizen of ours is\r\nentitled to any peculiar regard because of the way in which he worships\r\nhis Maker, or because of the birthplace of himself or his parents, nor\r\nshould he be in any way discriminated against therefor. Each must stand\r\non his worth as a man and each is entitled to be judged solely thereby.\r\n\r\nThere is no danger of having too many immigrants of the right kind. It\r\nmakes no difference from what country they come. If they are sound in\r\nbody and in mind, and, above all, if they are of good character, so\r\nthat we can rest assured that their children and grandchildren will be\r\nworthy fellow-citizens of our children and grandchildren, then we\r\nshould welcome them with cordial hospitality.\r\n\r\nBut the citizenship of this country should not be debased. It is vital\r\nthat we should keep high the standard of well-being among our\r\nwage-workers, and therefore we should not admit masses of men whose\r\nstandards of living and whose personal customs and habits are such that\r\nthey tend to lower the level of the American wage-worker; and above all\r\nwe should not admit any man of an unworthy type, any man concerning\r\nwhom we can say that he will himself be a bad citizen, or that his\r\nchildren and grandchildren will detract from instead of adding to the\r\nsum of the good citizenship of the country. Similarly we should take\r\nthe greatest care about naturalization. Fraudulent naturalization, the\r\nnaturalization of improper persons, is a curse to our Government; and\r\nit is the affair of every honest voter, wherever born, to see that no\r\nfraudulent voting is allowed, that no fraud in connection with\r\nnaturalization is permitted.\r\n\r\nIn the past year the cases of false, fraudulent, and improper\r\nnaturalization of aliens coming to the attention of the executive\r\nbranches of the Government have increased to an alarming degree.\r\nExtensive sales of forged certificates of naturalization have been\r\ndiscovered, as well as many cases of naturalization secured by perjury\r\nand fraud; and in addition, instances have accumulated showing that\r\nmany courts issue certificates of naturalization carelessly and upon\r\ninsufficient evidence.\r\n\r\nUnder the Constitution it is in the power of the Congress \"to establish\r\na uniform rule of naturalization,\" and numerous laws have from time to\r\ntime been enacted for that purpose, which have been supplemented in a\r\nfew States by State laws having special application. The Federal\r\nstatutes permit naturalization by any court of record in the United\r\nStates having common-law jurisdiction and a seal and clerk, except the\r\npolice court of the District of Columbia, and nearly all these courts\r\nexercise this important function. It results that where so many courts\r\nof such varying grades have jurisdiction, there is lack of uniformity\r\nin the rules applied in conferring naturalization. Some courts are\r\nstrict and others lax. An alien who may secure naturalization in one\r\nplace might be denied it in another, and the intent of the\r\nconstitutional provision is in fact defeated. Furthermore, the\r\ncertificates of naturalization issued by the courts differ widely in\r\nwording and appearance, and when they are brought into use in foreign\r\ncountries, are frequently subject to suspicion.\r\n\r\nThere should be a comprehensive revision of the naturalization laws.\r\nThe courts having power to naturalize should be definitely named by\r\nnational authority; the testimony upon which naturalization may be\r\nconferred should be definitely prescribed; publication of impending\r\nnaturalization applications should be required in advance of their\r\nhearing in court; the form and wording of all certificates issued\r\nshould be uniform throughout the country, and the courts should be\r\nrequired to make returns to the Secretary of State at stated periods of\r\nall naturalizations conferred.\r\n\r\nNot only are the laws relating to naturalization now defective, but\r\nthose relating to citizenship of the United States ought also to be\r\nmade the subject of scientific inquiry with a view to probable further\r\nlegislation. By what acts expatriation may be assumed to have been\r\naccomplished, how long an American citizen may reside abroad and\r\nreceive the protection of our passport, whether any degree of\r\nprotection should be extended to one who has made the declaration of\r\nintention to become a citizen of the United States but has not secured\r\nnaturalization, are questions of serious import, involving personal\r\nrights and often producing friction between this Government and foreign\r\ngovernments. Yet upon these question our laws are silent. I recommend\r\nthat an examination be made into the subjects of citizenship,\r\nexpatriation, and protection of Americans abroad, with a view to\r\nappropriate legislation.\r\n\r\nThe power of the Government to protect the integrity of the elections\r\nof its own officials is inherent and has been recognized and affirmed\r\nby repeated declarations of the Supreme Court. There is no enemy of\r\nfree government more dangerous and none so insidious as the corruption\r\nof the electorate. No one defends or excuses corruption, and it would\r\nseem to follow that none would oppose vigorous measures to eradicate\r\nit. I recommend the enactment of a law directed against bribery and\r\ncorruption in Federal elections. The details of such a law may be\r\nsafely left to the wise discretion of the Congress, but it should go as\r\nfar as under the Constitution it is possible to go, and should include\r\nsevere penalties against him who gives or receives a bribe intended to\r\ninfluence his act or opinion as an elector; and provisions for the\r\npublication not only of the expenditures for nominations and elections\r\nof all candidates but also of all contributions received and\r\nexpenditures made by political committees.\r\n\r\nNo subject is better worthy the attention of the Congress than that\r\nportion of the report of the Attorney-General dealing with the long\r\ndelays and the great obstruction to justice experienced in the cases of\r\nBeavers, Green and Gaynor, and Benson. Were these isolated and special\r\ncases, I should not call your attention to them; but the difficulties\r\nencountered as regards these men who have been indicted for criminal\r\npractices are not exceptional; they are precisely similar in kind to\r\nwhat occurs again and again in the case of criminals who have\r\nsufficient means to enable them to take advantage of a system of\r\nprocedure which has grown up in the Federal courts and which amounts in\r\neffect to making the law easy of enforcement against the man who has no\r\nmoney, and difficult of enforcement, even to the point of sometimes\r\nsecuring immunity, as regards the man who has money. In criminal cases\r\nthe writ of the United States should run throughout its borders. The\r\nwheels of justice should not be clogged, as they have been clogged in\r\nthe cases above mentioned, where it has proved absolutely impossible to\r\nbring the accused to the place appointed by the Constitution for his\r\ntrial. Of recent years there has been grave and increasing complaint of\r\nthe difficulty of bringing to justice those criminals whose\r\ncriminality, instead of being against one person in the Republic, is\r\nagainst all persons in the Republic, because it is against the Republic\r\nitself. Under any circumstance and from the very nature of the case it\r\nis often exceedingly difficult to secure proper punishment of those who\r\nhave been guilty of wrongdoing against the Government. By the time the\r\noffender can be brought into court the popular wrath against him has\r\ngenerally subsided; and there is in most instances very slight danger\r\nindeed of any prejudice existing in the minds of the jury against him.\r\nAt present the interests of the innocent man are amply safeguarded; but\r\nthe interests of the Government, that is, the interests of honest\r\nadministration, that is the interests of the people, are not recognized\r\nas they should be. No subject better warrants the attention of the\r\nCongress. Indeed, no subject better warrants the attention of the bench\r\nand the bar throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nAlaska, like all our Territorial acquisitions, has proved resourceful\r\nbeyond the expectations of those who made the purchase. It has become\r\nthe home of many hardy, industrious, and thrifty American citizens.\r\nTowns of a permanent character have been built. The extent of its\r\nwealth in minerals, timber, fisheries, and agriculture, while great, is\r\nprobably not comprehended yet in any just measure by our people. We do\r\nknow, however, that from a very small beginning its products have grown\r\nuntil they are a steady and material contribution to the wealth of the\r\nnation. Owing to the immensity of Alaska and its location in the far\r\nnorth, it is a difficult matter to provide many things essential to its\r\ngrowth and to the happiness and comfort of its people by private\r\nenterprise alone. It should, therefore, receive reasonable aid from the\r\nGovernment. The Government has already done excellent work for Alaska\r\nin laying cables and building telegraph lines. This work has been done\r\nin the most economical and efficient way by the Signal Corps of the\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\nIn some respects it has outgrown its present laws, while in others\r\nthose laws have been found to be inadequate. In order to obtain\r\ninformation upon which I could rely I caused an official of the\r\nDepartment of Justice, in whose judgment I have confidence, to visit\r\nAlaska during the past summer for the purpose of ascertaining how\r\ngovernment is administered there and what legislation is actually\r\nneeded at present. A statement of the conditions found to exist,\r\ntogether with some recommendations and the reasons therefor, in which I\r\nstrongly concur, will be found in the annual report of the\r\nAttorney-General. In some instances I feel that the legislation\r\nsuggested is so imperatively needed that I am moved briefly to\r\nemphasize the Attorney-General's proposals.\r\n\r\nUnder the Code of Alaska as it now stands many purely administrative\r\npowers and duties, including by far the most important, devolve upon\r\nthe district judges or upon the clerks of the district court acting\r\nunder the direction of the judges, while the governor, upon whom these\r\npowers and duties should logically fall, has nothing specific to do\r\nexcept to make annual reports, issue Thanksgiving Day proclamations,\r\nand appoint Indian policemen and notaries public. I believe it\r\nessential to good government in Alaska, and therefore recommend, that\r\nthe Congress divest the district judges and the clerks of their courts\r\nof the administrative or executive functions that they now exercise and\r\ncast them upon the governor. This would not be an innovation; it would\r\nsimply conform the government of Alaska to fundamental principles,\r\nmaking the governorship a real instead of a merely nominal office, and\r\nleaving the judges free to give their entire attention to their\r\njudicial duties and at the same time removing them from a great deal of\r\nthe strife that now embarrasses the judicial office in Alaska.\r\n\r\nI also recommend that the salaries of the district judges and district\r\nattorneys in Alaska be increased so as to make them equal to those\r\nreceived by corresponding officers in the United States after deducting\r\nthe difference in the cost of living; that the district attorneys\r\nshould be prohibited from engaging in private practice; that United\r\nStates commissioners be appointed by the governor of the Territory\r\ninstead of by the district judges, and that a fixed salary be provided\r\nfor them to take the place of the discredited \"fee system,\" which\r\nshould be abolished in all offices; that a mounted constabulary be\r\ncreated to police the territory outside the limits of incorporated\r\ntowns--a vast section now wholly without police protection; and that\r\nsome provision be made to at least lessen the oppressive delays and\r\ncosts that now attend the prosecution of appeals from the district\r\ncourt of Alaska. There should be a division of the existing judicial\r\ndistricts, and an increase in the number of judges.\r\n\r\nAlaska should have a Delegate in the Congress. Where possible, the\r\nCongress should aid in the construction of needed wagon roads.\r\nAdditional light-houses should be provided. In my judgment, it is\r\nespecially important to aid in such manner as seems just and feasible\r\nin the construction of a trunk line of railway to connect the Gulf of\r\nAlaska with the Yukon River through American territory. This would be\r\nmost beneficial to the development of the resources of the Territory,\r\nand to the comfort and welfare of its people.\r\n\r\nSalmon hatcheries should be established in many different streams, so\r\nas to secure the preservation of this valuable food fish. Salmon\r\nfisheries and canneries should be prohibited on certain of the rivers\r\nwhere the mass of those Indians dwell who live almost exclusively on\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nThe Alaskan natives are kindly, intelligent, anxious to learn, and\r\nwilling to work. Those who have come under the influence of\r\ncivilization, even for a limited period, have proved their capability\r\nof becoming self-supporting, self-respecting citizens, and ask only for\r\nthe just enforcement of law and intelligent instruction and\r\nsupervision. Others, living in more remote regions, primitive, simple\r\nhunters and fisher folk, who know only the life of the woods and the\r\nwaters, are daily being confronted with twentieth-century civilization\r\nwith all of its complexities. Their country is being overrun by\r\nstrangers, the game slaughtered and driven away, the streams depleted\r\nof fish, and hitherto unknown and fatal diseases brought to them, all\r\nof which combine to produce a state of abject poverty and want which\r\nmust result in their extinction. Action in their interest is demanded\r\nby every consideration of justice and humanity.\r\n\r\nThe needs of these people are:\r\n\r\nThe abolition of the present fee system, whereby the native is\r\ndegraded, imposed upon, and taught the injustice of law.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of hospitals at central points, so that contagious\r\ndiseases that are brought to them continually by incoming whites may be\r\nlocalized and not allowed to become epidemic, to spread death and\r\ndestitution over great areas.\r\n\r\nThe development of the educational system in the form of practical\r\ntraining in such industries as will assure the Indians self-support\r\nunder the changed conditions in which they will have to live.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the office of the governor should be extended to include\r\nthe supervision of Indian affairs, with necessary assistants in\r\ndifferent districts. He should be provided with the means and the power\r\nto protect and advise the native people, to furnish medical treatment\r\nin time of epidemics, and to extend material relief in periods of\r\nfamine and extreme destitution.\r\n\r\nThe Alaskan natives should be given the right to acquire, hold, and\r\ndispose of property upon the same conditions as given other\r\ninhabitants; and the privilege of citizenship should be given to such\r\nas may be able to meet certain definite requirements. In Hawaii\r\nCongress should give the governor power to remove all the officials\r\nappointed under him. The harbor of Honolulu should be dredged. The\r\nMarine-Hospital Service should be empowered to study leprosy in the\r\nislands. I ask special consideration for the report and recommendation\r\nof the governor of Porto Rico.\r\n\r\nIn treating of our foreign policy and of the attitude that this great\r\nNation should assume in the world at large, it is absolutely necessary\r\nto consider the Army and the Navy, and the Congress, through which the\r\nthought of the Nation finds its expression, should keep ever vividly in\r\nmind the fundamental fact that it is impossible to treat our foreign\r\npolicy, whether this policy takes shape in the effort to secure justice\r\nfor others or justice for ourselves, save as conditioned upon the\r\nattitude we are willing to take toward our Army, and especially toward\r\nour Navy. It is not merely unwise, it is contemptible, for a nation, as\r\nfor an individual, to use high-sounding language to proclaim its\r\npurposes, or to take positions which are ridiculous if unsupported by\r\npotential force, and then to refuse to provide this force. If there is\r\nno intention of providing and of keeping the force necessary to back up\r\na strong attitude, then it is far better not to assume such an\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\nThe steady aim of this Nation, as of all enlightened nations, should be\r\nto strive to bring ever nearer the day when there shall prevail\r\nthroughout the world the peace of justice. There are kinds of peace\r\nwhich are highly undesirable, which are in the long run as destructive\r\nas any war. Tyrants and oppressors have many times made a wilderness\r\nand called it peace. Many times peoples who were slothful or timid or\r\nshortsighted, who had been enervated by ease or by luxury, or misled by\r\nfalse teachings, have shrunk in unmanly fashion from doing duty that\r\nwas stern and that needed self-sacrifice, and have sought to hide from\r\ntheir own minds their shortcomings, their ignoble motives, by calling\r\nthem love of peace. The peace of tyrannous terror, the peace of craven\r\nweakness, the peace of injustice, all these should be shunned as we\r\nshun unrighteous war. The goal to set before us as a nation, the goal\r\nwhich should be set before all mankind, is the attainment of the peace\r\nof justice, of the peace which comes when each nation is not merely\r\nsafe-guarded in its own rights, but scrupulously recognizes and\r\nperforms its duty toward others. Generally peace tells for\r\nrighteousness; but if there is conflict between the two, then our\r\nfealty is due-first to the cause of righteousness. Unrighteous wars are\r\ncommon, and unrighteous peace is rare; but both should be shunned. The\r\nright of freedom and the responsibility for the exercise of that right\r\ncan not be divorced. One of our great poets has well and finely said\r\nthat freedom is not a gift that tarries long in the hands of cowards.\r\nNeither does it tarry long in the hands of those too slothful, too\r\ndishonest, or too unintelligent to exercise it. The eternal vigilance\r\nwhich is the price of liberty must be exercised, sometimes to guard\r\nagainst outside foes; although of course far more often to guard\r\nagainst our own selfish or thoughtless shortcomings.\r\n\r\nIf these self-evident truths are kept before us, and only if they are\r\nso kept before us, we shall have a clear idea of what our foreign\r\npolicy in its larger aspects should be. It is our duty to remember that\r\na nation has no more right to do injustice to another nation, strong or\r\nweak, than an individual has to do injustice to another individual;\r\nthat the same moral law applies in one case as in the other. But we\r\nmust also remember that it is as much the duty of the Nation to guard\r\nits own rights and its own interests as it is the duty of the\r\nindividual so to do. Within the Nation the individual has now delegated\r\nthis right to the State, that is, to the representative of all the\r\nindividuals, and it is a maxim of the law that for every wrong there is\r\na remedy. But in international law we have not advanced by any means as\r\nfar as we have advanced in municipal law. There is as yet no judicial\r\nway of enforcing a right in international law. When one nation wrongs\r\nanother or wrongs many others, there is no tribunal before which the\r\nwrongdoer can be brought. Either it is necessary supinely to acquiesce\r\nin the wrong, and thus put a premium upon brutality and aggression, or\r\nelse it is necessary for the aggrieved nation valiantly to stand up for\r\nits rights. Until some method is devised by which there shall be a\r\ndegree of international control over offending nations, it would be a\r\nwicked thing for the most civilized powers, for those with most sense\r\nof international obligations and with keenest and most generous\r\nappreciation of the difference between right and wrong, to disarm. If\r\nthe great civilized nations of the present day should completely\r\ndisarm, the result would mean an immediate recrudescence of barbarism\r\nin one form or another. Under any circumstances a sufficient armament\r\nwould have to be kept up to serve the purposes of international police;\r\nand until international cohesion and the sense of international duties\r\nand rights are far more advanced than at present, a nation desirous\r\nboth of securing respect for itself and of doing good to others must\r\nhave a force adequate for the work which it feels is allotted to it as\r\nits part of the general world duty. Therefore it follows that a\r\nself-respecting, just, and far-seeing nation should on the one hand\r\nendeavor by every means to aid in the development of the various\r\nmovements which tend to provide substitutes for war, which tend to\r\nrender nations in their actions toward one another, and indeed toward\r\ntheir own peoples, more responsive to the general sentiment of humane\r\nand civilized mankind; and on the other hand that it should keep\r\nprepared, while scrupulously avoiding wrongdoing itself, to repel any\r\nwrong, and in exceptional cases to take action which in a more advanced\r\nstage of international relations would come under the head of the\r\nexercise of the international police. A great free people owes it to\r\nitself and to all mankind not to sink into helplessness before the\r\npowers of evil.\r\n\r\nWe are in every way endeavoring to help on, with cordial good will,\r\nevery movement which will tend to bring us into more friendly relations\r\nwith the rest of mankind. In pursuance of this policy I shall shortly\r\nlay before the Senate treaties of arbitration with all powers which are\r\nwilling to enter into these treaties with us. It is not possible at\r\nthis period of the world's development to agree to arbitrate all\r\nmatters, but there are many matters of possible difference between us\r\nand other nations which can be thus arbitrated. Furthermore, at the\r\nrequest of the Interparliamentary Union, an eminent body composed of\r\npractical statesmen from all countries, I have asked the Powers to join\r\nwith this Government in a second Hague conference, at which it is hoped\r\nthat the work already so happily begun at The Hague may be carried some\r\nsteps further toward completion. This carries out the desire expressed\r\nby the first Hague conference itself.\r\n\r\nIt is not true that the United States feels any land hunger or\r\nentertains any projects as regards the other nations of the Western\r\nHemisphere save such as are for their welfare. All that this country\r\ndesires is to see the neighboring countries stable, orderly, and\r\nprosperous. Any country whose people conduct themselves well can count\r\nupon our hearty friendship. If a nation shows that it knows how to act\r\nwith reasonable efficiency and decency in social and political matters,\r\nif it keeps order and pays its obligations, it need fear no\r\ninterference from the United States. Chronic wrongdoing, or an\r\nimpotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized\r\nsociety, may in America, as elsewhere, ultimately require intervention\r\nby some civilized nation, and in the Western Hemisphere the adherence\r\nof the United States to the Monroe Doctrine may force the United\r\nStates, however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or\r\nimpotence, to the exercise of an international police power. If every\r\ncountry washed by the Caribbean Sea would show the progress in stable\r\nand just civilization which with the aid of the Platt amendment Cuba\r\nhas shown since our troops left the island, and which so many of the\r\nrepublics in both Americas are constantly and brilliantly showing, all\r\nquestion of interference by this Nation with their affairs would be at\r\nan end. Our interests and those of our southern neighbors are in\r\nreality identical. They have great natural riches, and if within their\r\nborders the reign of law and justice obtains, prosperity is sure to\r\ncome to them. While they thus obey the primary laws of civilized\r\nsociety they may rest assured that they will be treated by us in a\r\nspirit of cordial and helpful sympathy. We would interfere with them\r\nonly in the last resort, and then only if it became evident that their\r\ninability or unwillingness to do justice at home and abroad had\r\nviolated the rights of the United States or had invited foreign\r\naggression to the detriment of the entire body of American nations. It\r\nis a mere truism to say that every nation, whether in America or\r\nanywhere else, which desires to maintain its freedom, its independence,\r\nmust ultimately realize that the right of such independence can not be\r\nseparated from the responsibility of making good use of it.\r\n\r\nIn asserting the Monroe Doctrine, in taking such steps as we have taken\r\nin regard to Cuba, Venezuela, and Panama, and in endeavoring to\r\ncircumscribe the theater of war in the Far East, and to secure the open\r\ndoor in China, we have acted in our own interest as well as in the\r\ninterest of humanity at large. There are, however, cases in which,\r\nwhile our own interests are not greatly involved, strong appeal is made\r\nto our sympathies. Ordinarily it is very much wiser and more useful for\r\nus to concern ourselves with striving for our own moral and material\r\nbetterment here at home than to concern ourselves with trying to better\r\nthe condition of things in other nations. We have plenty of sins of our\r\nown to war against, and under ordinary circumstances we can do more for\r\nthe general uplifting of humanity by striving with heart and soul to\r\nput a stop to civic corruption, to brutal lawlessness and violent race\r\nprejudices here at home than by passing resolutions about wrongdoing\r\nelsewhere. Nevertheless there are occasional crimes committed on so\r\nvast a scale and of such peculiar horror as to make us doubt whether it\r\nis not our manifest duty to endeavor at least to show our disapproval\r\nof the deed and our sympathy with those who have suffered by it. The\r\ncases must be extreme in which such a course is justifiable. There must\r\nbe no effort made to remove the mote from our brother's eye if we\r\nrefuse to remove the beam from our own. But in extreme cases action may\r\nbe justifiable and proper. What form the action shall take must depend\r\nupon the circumstances of the case; that is, upon the degree of the\r\natrocity and upon our power to remedy it. The cases in which we could\r\ninterfere by force of arms as we interfered to put a stop to\r\nintolerable conditions in Cuba are necessarily very few. Yet it is not\r\nto be expected that a people like ours, which in spite of certain very\r\nobvious shortcomings, nevertheless as a whole shows by its consistent\r\npractice its belief in the principles of civil and religious liberty\r\nand of orderly freedom, a people among whom even the worst crime, like\r\nthe crime of lynching, is never more than sporadic, so that individuals\r\nand not classes are molested in their fundamental rights--it is\r\ninevitable that such a nation should desire eagerly to give expression\r\nto its horror on an occasion like that of the massacre of the Jews in\r\nKishenef, or when it witnesses such systematic and long-extended\r\ncruelty and oppression as the cruelty and oppression of which the\r\nArmenians have been the victims, and which have won for them the\r\nindignant pity of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nEven where it is not possible to secure in other nations the observance\r\nof the principles which we accept as axiomatic, it is necessary for us\r\nfirmly to insist upon the rights of our own citizens without regard to\r\ntheir creed or race; without regard to whether they were born here or\r\nborn abroad. It has proved very difficult to secure from Russia the\r\nright for our Jewish fellow-citizens to receive passports and travel\r\nthrough Russian territory. Such conduct is not only unjust and\r\nirritating toward us, but it is difficult to see its wisdom from\r\nRussia's standpoint. No conceivable good is accomplished by it. If an\r\nAmerican Jew or an American Christian misbehaves himself in Russia he\r\ncan at once be driven out; but the ordinary American Jew, like the\r\nordinary American Christian, would behave just about as he behaves\r\nhere, that is, behave as any good citizen ought to behave; and where\r\nthis is the case it is a wrong against which we are entitled to protest\r\nto refuse him his passport without regard to his conduct and character,\r\nmerely on racial and religious grounds. In Turkey our difficulties\r\narise less from the way in which our citizens are sometimes treated\r\nthan from the indignation inevitably excited in seeing such fearful\r\nmisrule as has been witnessed both in Armenia and Macedonia.\r\n\r\nThe strong arm of the Government in enforcing respect for its just\r\nrights in international matters is the Navy of the United States. I\r\nmost earnestly recommend that there be no halt in the work of\r\nupbuilding the American Navy. There is no more patriotic duty before us\r\na people than to keep the Navy adequate to the needs of this country's\r\nposition. We have undertaken to build the Isthmian Canal. We have\r\nundertaken to secure for ourselves our just share in the trade of the\r\nOrient. We have undertaken to protect our citizens from proper\r\ntreatment in foreign lands. We continue steadily to insist on the\r\napplication of the Monroe Doctrine to the Western Hemisphere. Unless\r\nour attitude in these and all similar matters is to be a mere boastful\r\nsham we can not afford to abandon our naval programme. Our voice is now\r\npotent for peace, and is so potent because we are not afraid of war.\r\nBut our protestations upon behalf of peace would neither receive nor\r\ndeserve the slightest attention if we were impotent to make them good.\r\n\r\nThe war which now unfortunately rages in the far East has emphasized in\r\nstriking fashion the new possibilities of naval warfare. The lessons\r\ntaught are both strategic and tactical, and are political as well as\r\nmilitary. The experiences of the war have shown in conclusive fashion\r\nthat while sea-going and sea-keeping torpedo destroyers are\r\nindispensable, and fast lightly armed and armored cruisers very useful,\r\nyet that the main reliance, the main standby, in any navy worthy the\r\nname must be the great battle ships, heavily armored and heavily\r\ngunned. Not a Russian or Japanese battle ship has been sunk by a\r\ntorpedo boat, or by gunfire, while among the less protected ships,\r\ncruiser after cruiser has been destroyed whenever the hostile squadrons\r\nhave gotten within range of one another's weapons. There will always be\r\na large field of usefulness for cruisers, especially of the more\r\nformidable type. We need to increase the number of torpedo-boat\r\ndestroyers, paying less heed to their having a knot or two extra speed\r\nthan to their capacity to keep the seas for weeks, and, if necessary,\r\nfor months at a time. It is wise to build submarine torpedo boats, as\r\nunder certain circumstances they might be very useful. But most of all\r\nwe need to continue building our fleet of battle ships, or ships so\r\npowerfully armed that they can inflict the maximum of damage upon our\r\nopponents, and so well protected that they can suffer a severe\r\nhammering in return without fatal impairment of their ability to fight\r\nand maneuver. Of course ample means must be provided for enabling the\r\npersonnel of the Navy to be brought to the highest point of efficiency.\r\nOur great fighting ships and torpedo boats must be ceaselessly trained\r\nand maneuvered in squadrons. The officers and men can only learn their\r\ntrade thoroughly by ceaseless practice on the high seas. In the event\r\nof war it would be far better to have no ships at all than to have\r\nships of a poor and ineffective type, or ships which, however good,\r\nwere yet manned by untrained and unskillful crews. The best officers\r\nand men in a poor ship could do nothing against fairly good opponents;\r\nand on the other hand a modern war ship is useless unless the officers\r\nand men aboard her have become adepts in their duties. The marksmanship\r\nin our Navy has improved in an extraordinary degree during the last\r\nthree years, and on the whole the types of our battleships are\r\nimproving; but much remains to be done. Sooner or later we shall have\r\nto provide for some method by which there will be promotions for merit\r\nas well as for seniority, or else retirement all those who after a\r\ncertain age have not advanced beyond a certain grade; while no effort\r\nmust be spared to make the service attractive to the enlisted men in\r\norder that they may be kept as long as possible in it. Reservation\r\npublic schools should be provided wherever there are navy-yards.\r\n\r\nWithin the last three years the United States has set an example in\r\ndisarmament where disarmament was proper. By law our Army is fixed at a\r\nmaximum of one hundred thousand and a minimum of sixty thousand men.\r\nWhen there was insurrection in the Philippines we kept the Army at the\r\nmaximum. Peace came in the Philippines, and now our Army has been\r\nreduced to the minimum at which it is possible to keep it with due\r\nregard to its efficiency. The guns now mounted require twenty-eight\r\nthousand men, if the coast fortifications are to be adequately manned.\r\nRelatively to the Nation, it is not now so large as the police force of\r\nNew York or Chicago relatively to the population of either city. We\r\nneed more officers; there are not enough to perform the regular army\r\nwork. It is very important that the officers of the Army should be\r\naccustomed to handle their men in masses, as it is also important that\r\nthe National Guard of the several States should be accustomed to actual\r\nfield maneuvering, especially in connection with the regulars. For this\r\nreason we are to be congratulated upon the success of the field\r\nmaneuvers at Manassas last fall, maneuvers in which a larger number of\r\nRegulars and National Guard took part than was ever before assembled\r\ntogether in time of peace. No other civilized nation has, relatively to\r\nits population, such a diminutive Army as ours; and while the Army is\r\nso small we are not to be excused if we fail to keep it at a very high\r\ngrade of proficiency. It must be incessantly practiced; the standard\r\nfor the enlisted men should be kept very high, while at the same time\r\nthe service should be made as attractive as possible; and the standard\r\nfor the officers should be kept even higher--which, as regards the\r\nupper ranks, can best be done by introducing some system of selection\r\nand rejection into the promotions. We should be able, in the event of\r\nsome sudden emergency, to put into the field one first-class army\r\ncorps, which should be, as a whole, at least the equal of any body of\r\ntroops of like number belonging to any other nation.\r\n\r\nGreat progress has been made in protecting our coasts by adequate\r\nfortifications with sufficient guns. We should, however, pay much more\r\nheed than at present to the development of an extensive system of\r\nfloating mines for use in all our more important harbors. These mines\r\nhave been proved to be a most formidable safeguard against hostile\r\nfleets.\r\n\r\nI earnestly call the attention of the Congress to the need of amending\r\nthe existing law relating to the award of Congressional medals of honor\r\nin the Navy so as to provide that they may be awarded to commissioned\r\nofficers and warrant officers as well as to enlisted men. These justly\r\nprized medals are given in the Army alike to the officers and the\r\nenlisted men, and it is most unjust that the commissioned officers and\r\nwarrant officers of the Navy should not in this respect have the same\r\nrights as their brethren in the Army and as the enlisted men of the\r\nNavy.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippine Islands there has been during the past year a\r\ncontinuation of the steady progress which has obtained ever since our\r\ntroops definitely got the upper hand of the insurgents. The Philippine\r\npeople, or, to speak more accurately, the many tribes, and even races,\r\nsundered from one another more or less sharply, who go to make up the\r\npeople of the Philippine Islands, contain many elements of good, and\r\nsome elements which we have a right to hope stand for progress. At\r\npresent they are utterly incapable of existing in independence at all\r\nor of building up a civilization of their own. I firmly believe that we\r\ncan help them to rise higher and higher in the scale of civilization\r\nand of capacity for self-government, and I most earnestly hope that in\r\nthe end they will be able to stand, if not entirely alone, yet in some\r\nsuch relation to the United States as Cuba now stands. This end is not\r\nyet in sight, and it may be indefinitely postponed if our people are\r\nfoolish enough to turn the attention of the Filipinos away from the\r\nproblems of achieving moral and material prosperity, of working for a\r\nstable, orderly, and just government, and toward foolish and dangerous\r\nintrigues for a complete independence for which they are as yet totally\r\nunfit.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand our people must keep steadily before their minds the\r\nfact that the justification for our stay in the Philippines must\r\nultimately rest chiefly upon the good we are able to do in the islands.\r\nI do not overlook the fact that in the development of our interests in\r\nthe Pacific Ocean and along its coasts, the Philippines have played and\r\nwill play an important part; and that our interests have been served in\r\nmore than one way by the possession of the islands. But our chief\r\nreason for continuing to hold them must be that we ought in good faith\r\nto try to do our share of the world's work, and this particular piece\r\nof work has been imposed upon us by the results of the war with Spain.\r\nThe problem presented to us in the Philippine Islands is akin to, but\r\nnot exactly like, the problems presented to the other great civilized\r\npowers which have possessions in the Orient. There are points of\r\nresemblance in our work to the work which is being done by the British\r\nin India and Egypt, by the French in Algiers, by the Dutch in Java, by\r\nthe Russians in Turkestan, by the Japanese in Formosa; but more\r\ndistinctly than any of these powers we are endeavoring to develop the\r\nnatives themselves so that they shall take an ever-increasing share in\r\ntheir own government, and as far as is prudent we are already admitting\r\ntheir representatives to a governmental equality with our own. There\r\nare commissioners, judges, and governors in the islands who are\r\nFilipinos and who have exactly the same share in the government of the\r\nislands as have their colleagues who are Americans, while in the lower\r\nranks, of course, the great majority of the public servants are\r\nFilipinos. Within two years we shall be trying the experiment of an\r\nelective lower house in the Philippine legislature. It may be that the\r\nFilipinos will misuse this legislature, and they certainly will misuse\r\nit if they are misled by foolish persons here at home into starting an\r\nagitation for their own independence or into any factious or improper\r\naction. In such case they will do themselves no good and will stop for\r\nthe time being all further effort to advance them and give them a\r\ngreater share in their own government. But if they act with wisdom and\r\nself-restraint, if they show that they are capable of electing a\r\nlegislature which in its turn is capable of taking a sane and efficient\r\npart in the actual work of government, they can rest assured that a\r\nfull and increasing measure of recognition will be given them. Above\r\nall they should remember that their prime needs are moral and\r\nindustrial, not political. It is a good thing to try the experiment of\r\ngiving them a legislature; but it is a far better thing to give them\r\nschools, good roads, railroads which will enable them to get their\r\nproducts to market, honest courts, an honest and efficient\r\nconstabulary, and all that tends to produce order, peace, fair dealing\r\nas between man and man, and habits of intelligent industry and thrift.\r\nIf they are safeguarded against oppression, and if their real wants,\r\nmaterial and spiritual, are studied intelligently and in a spirit of\r\nfriendly sympathy, much more good will be done them than by any effort\r\nto give them political power, though this effort may in its own proper\r\ntime and place be proper enough.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile our own people should remember that there is need for the\r\nhighest standard of conduct among the Americans sent to the Philippine\r\nIslands, not only among the public servants but among the private\r\nindividuals who go to them. It is because I feel this so deeply that in\r\nthe administration of these islands I have positively refused to permit\r\nany discrimination whatsoever for political reasons and have insisted\r\nthat in choosing the public servants consideration should be paid\r\nsolely to the worth of the men chosen and to the needs of the islands.\r\nThere is no higher body of men in our public service than we have in\r\nthe Philippine Islands under Governor Wright and his associates. So far\r\nas possible these men should be given a free hand, and their\r\nsuggestions should receive the hearty backing both of the Executive and\r\nof the Congress. There is need of a vigilant and disinterested support\r\nof our public servants in the Philippines by good citizens here in the\r\nUnited States. Unfortunately hitherto those of our people here at home\r\nwho have specially claimed to be the champions of the Filipinos have in\r\nreality been their worst enemies. This will continue to be the case as\r\nlong as they strive to make the Filipinos independent, and stop all\r\nindustrial development of the islands by crying out against the laws\r\nwhich would bring it on the ground that capitalists must not \"exploit\"\r\nthe islands. Such proceedings are not only unwise, but are most harmful\r\nto the Filipinos, who do not need independence at all, but who do need\r\ngood laws, good public servants, and the industrial development that\r\ncan only come if the investment, of American and foreign capital in the\r\nislands is favored in all legitimate ways.\r\n\r\nEvery measure taken concerning the islands should be taken primarily\r\nwith a view to their advantage. We should certainly give them lower\r\ntariff rates on their exports to the United States; if this is not done\r\nit will be a wrong to extend our shipping laws to them. I earnestly\r\nhope for the immediate enactment into law of the legislation now\r\npending to encourage American capital to seek investment in the islands\r\nin railroads, in factories, in plantations, and in lumbering and\r\nmining.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nTheodore Roosevelt\r\nDecember 5, 1905\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe people of this country continue to enjoy great prosperity.\r\nUndoubtedly there will be ebb and flow in such prosperity, and this ebb\r\nand flow will be felt more or less by all members of the community,\r\nboth by the deserving and the undeserving. Against the wrath of the\r\nLord the wisdom of man cannot avail; in time of flood or drought human\r\ningenuity can but partially repair the disaster. A general failure of\r\ncrops would hurt all of us. Again, if the folly of man mars the general\r\nwell-being, then those who are innocent of the folly will have to pay\r\npart of the penalty incurred by those who are guilty of the folly. A\r\npanic brought on by the speculative folly of part of the business\r\ncommunity would hurt the whole business community. But such stoppage of\r\nwelfare, though it might be severe, would not be lasting. In the long\r\nrun the one vital factor in the permanent prosperity of the country is\r\nthe high individual character of the average American worker, the\r\naverage American citizen, no matter whether his work be mental or\r\nmanual, whether he be farmer or wage-worker, business man or\r\nprofessional man.\r\n\r\nIn our industrial and social system the interests of all men are so\r\nclosely intertwined that in the immense majority of cases a\r\nstraight-dealing man who by his efficiency, by his ingenuity and\r\nindustry, benefits himself must also benefit others. Normally the man\r\nof great productive capacity who becomes rich by guiding the labor of\r\nmany other men does so by enabling them to produce more than they could\r\nproduce without his guidance; and both he and they share in the\r\nbenefit, which comes also to the public at large. The superficial fact\r\nthat the sharing may be unequal must never blind us to the underlying\r\nfact that there is this sharing, and that the benefit comes in some\r\ndegree to each man concerned. Normally the wage-worker, the man of\r\nsmall means, and the average consumer, as well as the average producer,\r\nare all alike helped by making conditions such that the man of\r\nexceptional business ability receives an exceptional reward for his\r\nability. Something can be done by legislation to help the general\r\nprosperity; but no such help of a permanently beneficial character can\r\nbe given to the less able and less fortunate, save as the results of a\r\npolicy which shall inure to the advantage of all industrious and\r\nefficient people who act decently; and this is only another way of\r\nsaying that any benefit which comes to the less able and less fortunate\r\nmust of necessity come even more to the more able and more fortunate.\r\nIf, therefore, the less fortunate man is moved by envy of his more\r\nfortunate brother to strike at the conditions under which they have\r\nboth, though unequally, prospered, the result will assuredly be that\r\nwhile danger may come to the one struck at, it will visit with an even\r\nheavier load the one who strikes the blow. Taken as a whole we must all\r\ngo up or down together.\r\n\r\nYet, while not merely admitting, but insisting upon this, it is also\r\ntrue that where there is no governmental restraint or supervision some\r\nof the exceptional men use their energies not in ways that are for the\r\ncommon good, but in ways which tell against this common good. The\r\nfortunes amassed through corporate organization are now so large, and\r\nvest such power in those that wield them, as to make it a matter of\r\nnecessity to give to the sovereign--that is, to the Government, which\r\nrepresents the people as a whole--some effective power of supervision\r\nover their corporate use. In order to insure a healthy social and\r\nindustrial life, every big corporation should be held responsible by,\r\nand be accountable to, some sovereign strong enough to control its\r\nconduct. I am in no sense hostile to corporations. This is an age of\r\ncombination, and any effort to prevent all combination will be not only\r\nuseless, but in the end vicious, because of the contempt for law which\r\nthe failure to enforce law inevitably produces. We should, moreover,\r\nrecognize in cordial and ample fashion the immense good effected by\r\ncorporate agencies in a country such as ours, and the wealth of\r\nintellect, energy, and fidelity devoted to their service, and therefore\r\nnormally to the service of the public, by their officers and directors.\r\nThe corporation has come to stay, just as the trade union has come to\r\nstay. Each can do and has done great good. Each should be favored so\r\nlong as it does good. But each should be sharply checked where it acts\r\nagainst law and justice.\r\n\r\nSo long as the finances of the Nation are kept upon an honest basis no\r\nother question of internal economy with which the Congress has the\r\npower to deal begins to approach in importance the matter of\r\nendeavoring to secure proper industrial conditions under which the\r\nindividuals--and especially the great corporations--doing an interstate\r\nbusiness are to act. The makers of our National Constitution provided\r\nespecially that the regulation of interstate commerce should come\r\nwithin the sphere of the General Government. The arguments in favor of\r\ntheir taking this stand were even then overwhelming. But they are far\r\nstronger today, in view of the enormous development of great business\r\nagencies, usually corporate in form. Experience has shown conclusively\r\nthat it is useless to try to get any adequate regulation and\r\nsupervision of these great corporations by State action. Such\r\nregulation and supervision can only be effectively exercised by a\r\nsovereign whose jurisdiction is coextensive with the field of work of\r\nthe corporations--that is, by the National Government. I believe that\r\nthis regulation and supervision can be obtained by the enactment of law\r\nby the Congress. If this proves impossible, it will certainly be\r\nnecessary ultimately to confer in fullest form such power upon the\r\nNational Government by a proper amendment of the Constitution. It would\r\nobviously be unwise to endeavor to secure such an amendment until it is\r\ncertain that the result cannot be obtained under the Constitution as it\r\nnow is. The laws of the Congress and of the several States hitherto, as\r\npassed upon by the courts, have resulted more often in showing that the\r\nStates have no power in the matter than that the National Government\r\nhas power; so that there at present exists a very unfortunate condition\r\nof things, under which these great corporations doing an interstate\r\nbusiness occupy the position of subjects without a sovereign, neither\r\nany State Government nor the National Government having effective\r\ncontrol over them. Our steady aim should be by legislation, cautiously\r\nand carefully undertaken, but resolutely persevered in, to assert the\r\nsovereignty of the National Government by affirmative action.\r\n\r\nThis is only in form an innovation. In substance it is merely a\r\nrestoration; for from the earliest time such regulation of industrial\r\nactivities has been recognized in the action of the lawmaking bodies;\r\nand all that I propose is to meet the changed conditions in such manner\r\nas will prevent the Commonwealth abdicating the power it has always\r\npossessed not only in this country, but also in England before and\r\nsince this country became a separate Nation.\r\n\r\nIt has been a misfortune that the National laws on this subject have\r\nhitherto been of a negative or prohibitive rather than an affirmative\r\nkind, and still more that they have in part sought to prohibit what\r\ncould not be effectively prohibited, and have in part in their\r\nprohibitions confounded what should be allowed and what should not be\r\nallowed. It is generally useless to try to prohibit all restraint on\r\ncompetition, whether this restraint be reasonable or unreasonable; and\r\nwhere it is not useless it is generally hurtful. Events have shown that\r\nit is not possible adequately to secure the enforcement of any law of\r\nthis kind by incessant appeal to the courts. The Department of Justice\r\nhas for the last four years devoted more attention to the enforcement\r\nof the anti-trust legislation than to anything else. Much has been\r\naccomplished, particularly marked has been the moral effect of the\r\nprosecutions; but it is increasingly evident that there will be a very\r\ninsufficient beneficial result in the way of economic change. The\r\nsuccessful prosecution of one device to evade the law immediately\r\ndevelops another device to accomplish the same purpose. What is needed\r\nis not sweeping prohibition of every arrangement, good or bad, which\r\nmay tend to restrict competition, but such adequate supervision and\r\nregulation as will prevent any restriction of competition from being to\r\nthe detriment of the public--as well as such supervision and regulation\r\nas will prevent other abuses in no way connected with restriction of\r\ncompetition. Of these abuses, perhaps the chief, although by no means\r\nthe only one, is overcapitalization--generally itself the result of\r\ndishonest promotion--because of the myriad evils it brings in its\r\ntrain; for such overcapitalization often means an inflation that\r\ninvites business panic; it always conceals the true relation of the\r\nprofit earned to the capital actually invested, and it creates a burden\r\nof interest payments which is a fertile cause of improper reduction in\r\nor limitation of wages; it damages the small investor, discourages\r\nthrift, and encourages gambling and speculation; while perhaps worst of\r\nall is the trickiness and dishonesty which it implies--for harm to\r\nmorals is worse than any possible harm to material interests, and the\r\ndebauchery of politics and business by great dishonest corporations is\r\nfar worse than any actual material evil they do the public. Until the\r\nNational Government obtains, in some manner which the wisdom of the\r\nCongress may suggest, proper control over the big corporations engaged\r\nin interstate commerce--that is, over the great majority of the big\r\ncorporations--it will be impossible to deal adequately with these\r\nevils.\r\n\r\nI am well aware of the difficulties of the legislation that I am\r\nsuggesting, and of the need of temperate and cautious action in\r\nsecuring it. I should emphatically protest against improperly radical\r\nor hasty action. The first thing to do is to deal with the great\r\ncorporations engaged in the business of interstate transportation. As I\r\nsaid in my message of December 6 last, the immediate and most pressing\r\nneed, so far as legislation is concerned, is the enactment into law of\r\nsome scheme to secure to the agents of the Government such supervision\r\nand regulation of the rates charged by the railroads of the country\r\nengaged in interstate traffic as shall summarily and effectively\r\nprevent the imposition of unjust or unreasonable rates. It must include\r\nputting a complete stop to rebates in every shape and form. This power\r\nto regulate rates, like all similar powers over the business world,\r\nshould be exercised with moderation, caution, and self-restraint; but\r\nit should exist, so that it can be effectively exercised when the need\r\narises.\r\n\r\nThe first consideration to be kept in mind is that the power should be\r\naffirmative and should be given to some administrative body created by\r\nthe Congress. If given to the present Interstate Commerce Commission,\r\nor to a reorganized Interstate Commerce Commission, such commission\r\nshould be made unequivocally administrative. I do not believe in the\r\nGovernment interfering with private business more than is necessary. I\r\ndo not believe in the Government undertaking any work which can with\r\npropriety be left in private hands. But neither do I believe in the\r\nGovernment flinching from overseeing any work when it becomes evident\r\nthat abuses are sure to obtain therein unless there is governmental\r\nsupervision. It is not my province to indicate the exact terms of the\r\nlaw which should be enacted; but I call the attention of the Congress\r\nto certain existing conditions with which it is desirable to deal, In\r\nmy judgment the most important provision which such law should contain\r\nis that conferring upon some competent administrative body the power to\r\ndecide, upon the case being brought before it, whether a given rate\r\nprescribed by a railroad is reasonable and just, and if it is found to\r\nbe unreasonable and unjust, then, after full investigation of the\r\ncomplaint, to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which it shall not be\r\nlawful to go--the maximum reasonable rate, as it is commonly\r\ncalled--this decision to go into effect within a reasonable time and to\r\nobtain from thence onward, subject to review by the courts. It\r\nsometimes happens at present not that a rate is too high but that a\r\nfavored shipper is given too low a rate. In such case the commission\r\nwould have the right to fix this already established minimum rate as\r\nthe maximum; and it would need only one or two such decisions by the\r\ncommission to cure railroad companies of the practice of giving\r\nimproper minimum rates. I call your attention to the fact that my\r\nproposal is not to give the commission power to initiate or originate\r\nrates generally, but to regulate a rate already fixed or originated by\r\nthe roads, upon complaint and after investigation. A heavy penalty\r\nshould be exacted from any corporation which fails to respect an order\r\nof the commission. I regard this power to establish a maximum rate as\r\nbeing essential to any scheme of real reform in the matter of railway\r\nregulation. The first necessity is to secure it; and unless it is\r\ngranted to the commission there is little use in touching the subject\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nIllegal transactions often occur under the forms of law. It has often\r\noccurred that a shipper has been told by a traffic officer to buy a\r\nlarge quantity of some commodity and then after it has been bought an\r\nopen reduction is made in the rate to take effect immediately, the\r\narrangement resulting to the profit of one shipper and the one railroad\r\nand to the damage of all their competitors; for it must not be\r\nforgotten that the big shippers are at least as much to blame as any\r\nrailroad in the matter of rebates. The law should make it clear so that\r\nnobody can fail to understand that any kind of commission paid on\r\nfreight shipments, whether in this form or in the form of fictitious\r\ndamages, or of a concession, a free pass, reduced passenger rate, or\r\npayment of brokerage, is illegal. It is worth while considering whether\r\nit would not be wise to confer on the Government the right of civil\r\naction against the beneficiary of a rebate for at least twice the value\r\nof the rebate; this would help stop what is really blackmail. Elevator\r\nallowances should be stopped, for they have now grown to such an extent\r\nthat they are demoralizing and are used as rebates.\r\n\r\nThe best possible regulation of rates would, of course, be that\r\nregulation secured by an honest agreement among the railroads\r\nthemselves to carry out the law. Such a general agreement would, for\r\ninstance, at once put a stop to the efforts of any one big shipper or\r\nbig railroad to discriminate against or secure advantages over some\r\nrival; and such agreement would make the railroads themselves agents\r\nfor enforcing the law. The power vested in the Government to put a stop\r\nto agreements to the detriment of the public should, in my judgment, be\r\naccompanied by power to permit, under specified conditions and careful\r\nsupervision, agreements clearly in the interest of the public. But, in\r\nmy judgment, the necessity for giving this further power is by no means\r\nas great as the necessity for giving the commission or administrative\r\nbody the other powers I have enumerated above; and it may well be\r\ninadvisable to attempt to vest this particular power in the commission\r\nor other administrative body until it already possesses and is\r\nexercising what I regard as by far the most important of all the powers\r\nI recommend--as indeed the vitally important power--that to fix a given\r\nmaximum rate, which rate, after the lapse of a reasonable time, goes\r\ninto full effect, subject to review by the courts.\r\n\r\nAll private-car lines, industrial roads, refrigerator charges, and the\r\nlike should be expressly put under the supervision of the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission or some similar body so far as rates, and\r\nagreements practically affecting rates, are concerned. The private car\r\nowners and the owners of industrial railroads are entitled to a fair\r\nand reasonable compensation on their investment, but neither private\r\ncars nor industrial railroads nor spur tracks should be utilized as\r\ndevices for securing preferential rates. A rebate in icing charges, or\r\nin mileage, or in a division of the rate for refrigerating charges is\r\njust as pernicious as a rebate in any other way. No lower rate should\r\napply on goods imported than actually obtains on domestic goods from\r\nthe American seaboard to destination except in cases where water\r\ncompetition is the controlling influence. There should be publicity of\r\nthe accounts of common carriers; no common carrier engaged in\r\ninterstate business should keep any books or memoranda other than those\r\nreported pursuant to law or regulation, and these books or memoranda\r\nshould be open to the inspection of the Government. Only in this way\r\ncan violations or evasions of the law be surely detected. A system of\r\nexamination of railroad accounts should be provided similar to that now\r\nconducted into the National banks by the bank examiners; a few\r\nfirst-class railroad accountants, if they had proper direction and\r\nproper authority to inspect books and papers, could accomplish much in\r\npreventing willful violations of the law. It would not be necessary for\r\nthem to examine into the accounts of any railroad unless for good\r\nreasons they were directed to do so by the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission. It is greatly to be desired that some way might be found by\r\nwhich an agreement as to transportation within a State intended to\r\noperate as a fraud upon the Federal interstate commerce laws could be\r\nbrought under the jurisdiction of the Federal authorities. At present\r\nit occurs that large shipments of interstate traffic are controlled by\r\nconcessions on purely State business, which of course amounts to an\r\nevasion of the law. The commission should have power to enforce fair\r\ntreatment by the great trunk lines of lateral and branch lines.\r\n\r\nI urge upon the Congress the need of providing for expeditious action\r\nby the Interstate Commerce Commission in all these matters, whether in\r\nregulating rates for transportation or for storing or for handling\r\nproperty or commodities in transit. The history of the cases litigated\r\nunder the present commerce act shows that its efficacy has been to a\r\ngreat degree destroyed by the weapon of delay, almost the most\r\nformidable weapon in the hands of those whose purpose it is to violate\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\nLet me most earnestly say that these recommendations are not made in\r\nany spirit of hostility to the railroads. On ethical grounds, on\r\ngrounds of right, such hostility would be intolerable; and on grounds\r\nof mere National self-interest we must remember that such hostility\r\nwould tell against the welfare not merely of some few rich men, but of\r\na multitude of small investors, a multitude of railway employes, wage\r\nworkers, and most severely against the interest of the public as a\r\nwhole. I believe that on the whole our railroads have done well and not\r\nill; but the railroad men who wish to do well should not be exposed to\r\ncompetition with those who have no such desire, and the only way to\r\nsecure this end is to give to some Government tribunal the power to see\r\nthat justice is done by the unwilling exactly as it is gladly done by\r\nthe willing. Moreover, if some Government body is given increased power\r\nthe effect will be to furnish authoritative answer on behalf of the\r\nrailroad whenever irrational clamor against it is raised, or whenever\r\ncharges made against it are disproved. I ask this legislation not only\r\nin the interest of the public but in the interest of the honest\r\nrailroad man and the honest shipper alike, for it is they who are\r\nchiefly jeoparded by the practices of their dishonest competitors. This\r\nlegislation should be enacted in a spirit as remote as possible from\r\nhysteria and rancor. If we of the American body politic are true to the\r\ntraditions we have inherited we shall always scorn any effort to make\r\nus hate any man because he is rich, just as much as we should scorn any\r\neffort to make us look down upon or treat contemptuously any man\r\nbecause he is poor. We judge a man by his conduct--that is, by his\r\ncharacter--and not by his wealth or intellect. If he makes his fortune\r\nhonestly, there is no just cause of quarrel with him. Indeed, we have\r\nnothing but the kindliest feelings of admiration for the successful\r\nbusiness man who behaves decently, whether he has made his success by\r\nbuilding or managing a railroad or by shipping goods over that\r\nrailroad. The big railroad men and big shippers are simply Americans of\r\nthe ordinary type who have developed to an extraordinary degree certain\r\ngreat business qualities. They are neither better nor worse than their\r\nfellow-citizens of smaller means. They are merely more able in certain\r\nlines and therefore exposed to certain peculiarly strong temptations.\r\nThese temptations have not sprung newly into being; the exceptionally\r\nsuccessful among mankind have always been exposed to them; but they\r\nhave grown amazingly in power as a result of the extraordinary\r\ndevelopment of industrialism along new lines, and under these new\r\nconditions, which the law-makers of old could not foresee and therefore\r\ncould not provide against, they have become so serious and menacing as\r\nto demand entirely new remedies. It is in the interest of the best type\r\nof railroad man and the best type of shipper no less than of the public\r\nthat there should be Governmental supervision and regulation of these\r\ngreat business operations, for the same reason that it is in the\r\ninterest of the corporation which wishes to treat its employes aright\r\nthat there should be an effective Employers' Liability act, or an\r\neffective system of factory laws to prevent the abuse of women and\r\nchildren. All such legislation frees the corporation that wishes to do\r\nwell from being driven into doing ill, in order to compete with its\r\nrival, which prefers to do ill. We desire to set up a moral standard.\r\nThere can be no delusion more fatal to the Nation than the delusion\r\nthat the standard of profits, of business prosperity, is sufficient in\r\njudging any business or political question--from rate legislation to\r\nmunicipal government. Business success, whether for the individual or\r\nfor the Nation, is a good thing only so far as it is accompanied by and\r\ndevelops a high standard of conduct--honor, integrity, civic courage.\r\nThe kind of business prosperity that blunts the standard of honor, that\r\nputs an inordinate value on mere wealth, that makes a man ruthless and\r\nconscienceless in trade, and weak and cowardly in citizenship, is not a\r\ngood thing at all, but a very bad thing for the Nation. This Government\r\nstands for manhood first and for business only as an adjunct of\r\nmanhood.\r\n\r\nThe question of transportation lies at the root of all industrial\r\nsuccess, and the revolution in transportation which has taken place\r\nduring the last half century has been the most important factor in the\r\ngrowth of the new industrial conditions. Most emphatically we do not\r\nwish to see the man of great talents refused the reward for his\r\ntalents. Still less do we wish to see him penalized but we do desire to\r\nsee the system of railroad transportation so handled that the strong\r\nman shall be given no advantage over the weak man. We wish to insure as\r\nfair treatment for the small town as for the big city; for the small\r\nshipper as for the big shipper. In the old days the highway of\r\ncommerce, whether by water or by a road on land, was open to all; it\r\nbelonged to the public and the traffic along it was free. At present\r\nthe railway is this highway, and we must do our best to see that it is\r\nkept open to all on equal terms. Unlike the old highway it is a very\r\ndifficult and complex thing to manage, and it is far better that it\r\nshould be managed by private individuals than by the Government. But it\r\ncan only be so managed on condition that justice is done the public. It\r\nis because, in my judgment, public ownership of railroads is highly\r\nundesirable and would probably in this country entail far-reaching\r\ndisaster, but I wish to see such supervision and regulation of them in\r\nthe interest of the public as will make it evident that there is no\r\nneed for public ownership. The opponents of Government regulation dwell\r\nupon the difficulties to be encountered and the intricate and involved\r\nnature of the problem. Their contention is true. It is a complicated\r\nand delicate problem, and all kinds of difficulties are sure to arise\r\nin connection with any plan of solution, while no plan will bring all\r\nthe benefits hoped for by its more optimistic adherents. Moreover,\r\nunder any healthy plan, the benefits will develop gradually and not\r\nrapidly. Finally, we must clearly understand that the public servants\r\nwho are to do this peculiarly responsible and delicate work must\r\nthemselves be of the highest type both as regards integrity and\r\nefficiency. They must be well paid, for otherwise able men cannot in\r\nthe long run be secured; and they must possess a lofty probity which\r\nwill revolt as quickly at the thought of pandering to any gust of\r\npopular prejudice against rich men as at the thought of anything even\r\nremotely resembling subserviency to rich men. But while I fully admit\r\nthe difficulties in the way, I do not for a moment admit that these\r\ndifficulties warrant us in stopping in our effort to secure a wise and\r\njust system. They should have no other effect than to spur us on to the\r\nexercise of the resolution, the even-handed justice, and the fertility\r\nof resource, which we like to think of as typically American, and which\r\nwill in the end achieve good results in this as in other fields of\r\nactivity. The task is a great one and underlies the task of dealing\r\nwith the whole industrial problem. But the fact that it is a great\r\nproblem does not warrant us in shrinking from the attempt to solve it.\r\nAt present we face such utter lack of supervision, such freedom from\r\nthe restraints of law, that excellent men have often been literally\r\nforced into doing what they deplored because otherwise they were left\r\nat the mercy of unscrupulous competitors. To rail at and assail the men\r\nwho have done as they best could under such conditions accomplishes\r\nlittle. What we need to do is to develop an orderly system, and such a\r\nsystem can only come through the gradually increased exercise of the\r\nright of efficient Government control.\r\n\r\nIn my annual message to the Fifty-eighth Congress, at its third\r\nsession, I called attention to the necessity for legislation requiring\r\nthe use of block signals upon railroads engaged in interstate commerce.\r\nThe number of serious collisions upon unblocked roads that have\r\noccurred within the past year adds force to the recommendation then\r\nmade. The Congress should provide, by appropriate legislation, for the\r\nintroduction of block signals upon all railroads engaged in interstate\r\ncommerce at the earliest practicable date, as a measure of increased\r\nsafety to the traveling public.\r\n\r\nThrough decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States and the\r\nlower Federal courts in cases brought before them for adjudication the\r\nsafety appliance law has been materially strengthened, and the\r\nGovernment has been enabled to secure its effective enforcement in\r\nalmost all cases, with the result that the condition of railroad\r\nequipment throughout the country is much improved and railroad employes\r\nperform their duties under safer conditions than heretofore. The\r\nGovernment's most effective aid in arriving at this result has been its\r\ninspection service, and that these improved conditions are not more\r\ngeneral is due to the insufficient number of inspectors employed. The\r\ninspection service has fully demonstrated its usefulness, and in\r\nappropriating for its maintenance the Congress should make provision\r\nfor an increase in the number of inspectors.\r\n\r\nThe excessive hours of labor to which railroad employes in train\r\nservice are in many cases subjected is also a matter which may well\r\nengage the serious attention of the Congress. The strain, both mental\r\nand physical, upon those who are engaged in the movement and operation\r\nof railroad trains under modern conditions is perhaps greater than that\r\nwhich exists in any other industry, and if there are any reasons for\r\nlimiting by law the hours of labor in any employment, they certainly\r\napply with peculiar force to the employment of those upon whose\r\nvigilance and alertness in the performance of their duties the safety\r\nof all who travel by rail depends.\r\n\r\nIn my annual message to the Fifty-seventh Congress, at its second\r\nsession, I recommended the passage of an employers' liability law for\r\nthe District of Columbia and in our navy yards. I renewed that\r\nrecommendation in my message to the Fifty-eighth Congress, at its\r\nsecond session, and further suggested the appointment of a commission\r\nto make a comprehensive study of employers' liability, with a view to\r\nthe enactment of a wise and Constitutional law covering the subject,\r\napplicable to all industries within the scope of the Federal power. I\r\nhope that such a law will be prepared and enacted as speedily as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe National Government has, as a rule, but little occasion to deal\r\nwith the formidable group of problems connected more or less directly\r\nwith what is known as the labor question, for in the great majority of\r\ncases these problems must be dealt with by the State and municipal\r\nauthorities, and not by the National Government. The National\r\nGovernment has control of the District of Columbia, however, and it\r\nshould see to it that the City of Washington is made a model city in\r\nall respects, both as regards parks, public playgrounds, proper\r\nregulation of the system of housing, so as to do away with the evils of\r\nalley tenements, a proper system of education, a proper system of\r\ndealing with truancy and juvenile offenders, a proper handling of the\r\ncharitable work of the District. Moreover, there should be proper\r\nfactory laws to prevent all abuses in the employment of women and\r\nchildren in the District. These will be useful chiefly as object\r\nlessons, but even this limited amount of usefulness would be of real\r\nNational value.\r\n\r\nThere has been demand for depriving courts of the power to issue\r\ninjunctions in labor disputes. Such special limitation of the equity\r\npowers of our courts would be most unwise. It is true that some judges\r\nhave misused this power; but this does not justify a denial of the\r\npower any more than an improper exercise of the power to call a strike\r\nby a labor leader would justify the denial of the right to strike. The\r\nremedy is to regulate the procedure by requiring the judge to give due\r\nnotice to the adverse parties before granting the writ, the hearing to\r\nbe ex parte if the adverse party does not appear at the time and place\r\nordered. What is due notice must depend upon the facts of the case; it\r\nshould not be used as a pretext to permit violation of law or the\r\njeopardizing of life or property. Of course, this would not authorize\r\nthe issuing of a restraining order or injunction in any case in which\r\nit is not already authorized by existing law.\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation I made in my last annual message for an\r\ninvestigation by the Department of Commerce and Labor of general labor\r\nconditions, especial attention to be paid to the conditions of child\r\nlabor and child-labor legislation in the several States. Such an\r\ninvestigation should take into account the various problems with which\r\nthe question of child labor is connected. It is true that these\r\nproblems can be actually met in most cases only by the States\r\nthemselves, but it would be well for the Nation to endeavor to secure\r\nand publish comprehensive information as to the conditions of the labor\r\nof children in the different States, so as to spur up those that are\r\nbehindhand and to secure approximately uniform legislation of a high\r\ncharacter among the several States. In such a Republic as ours the one\r\nthing that we cannot afford to neglect is the problem of turning out\r\ndecent citizens. The future of the Nation depends upon the citizenship\r\nof the generations to come; the children of today are those who\r\ntomorrow will shape the destiny of our land, and we cannot afford to\r\nneglect them. The Legislature of Colorado has recommended that the\r\nNational Government provide some general measure for the protection\r\nfrom abuse of children and dumb animals throughout the United States. I\r\nlay the matter before you for what I trust will be your favorable\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Commerce and Labor should also make a thorough\r\ninvestigation of the conditions of women in industry. Over five million\r\nAmerican women are now engaged in gainful occupations; yet there is an\r\nalmost complete dearth of data upon which to base any trustworthy\r\nconclusions as regards a subject as important as it is vast and\r\ncomplicated. There is need of full knowledge on which to base action\r\nlooking toward State and municipal legislation for the protection of\r\nworking women. The introduction of women into industry is working\r\nchange and disturbance in the domestic and social life of the Nation.\r\nThe decrease in marriage, and especially in the birth rate, has been\r\ncoincident with it. We must face accomplished facts, and the adjustment\r\nof factory conditions must be made, but surely it can be made with less\r\nfriction and less harmful effects on family life than is now the case.\r\nThis whole matter in reality forms one of the greatest sociological\r\nphenomena of our time; it is a social question of the first importance,\r\nof far greater importance than any merely political or economic\r\nquestion can be, and to solve it we need ample data, gathered in a sane\r\nand scientific spirit in the course of an exhaustive investigation.\r\n\r\nIn any great labor disturbance not only are employer and employe\r\ninterested, but a third party--the general public. Every considerable\r\nlabor difficulty in which interstate commerce is involved should be\r\ninvestigated by the Government and the facts officially reported to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nThe question of securing a healthy, self-respecting, and mutually\r\nsympathetic attitude as between employer and employe, capitalist and\r\nwage-worker, is a difficult one. All phases of the labor problem prove\r\ndifficult when approached. But the underlying principles, the root\r\nprinciples, in accordance with which the problem must be solved are\r\nentirely simple. We can get justice and right dealing only if we put as\r\nof paramount importance the principle of treating a man on his worth as\r\na man rather than with reference to his social position, his occupation\r\nor the class to which he belongs. There are selfish and brutal men in\r\nall ranks of life. If they are capitalists their selfishness and\r\nbrutality may take the form of hard indifference to suffering, greedy\r\ndisregard of every moral restraint which interferes with the\r\naccumulation of wealth, and cold-blooded exploitation of the weak; or,\r\nif they are laborers, the form of laziness, of sullen envy of the more\r\nfortunate, and of willingness to perform deeds of murderous violence.\r\nSuch conduct is just as reprehensible in one case as in the other, and\r\nall honest and farseeing men should join in warring against it wherever\r\nit becomes manifest. Individual capitalist and individual wage-worker,\r\ncorporation and union, are alike entitled to the protection of the law,\r\nand must alike obey the law. Moreover, in addition to mere obedience to\r\nthe law, each man, if he be really a good citizen, must show broad\r\nsympathy for his neighbor and genuine desire to look at any question\r\narising between them from the standpoint of that neighbor no less than\r\nfrom his own, and to this end it is essential that capitalist and\r\nwage-worker should consult freely one with the other, should each\r\nstrive to bring closer the day when both shall realize that they are\r\nproperly partners and not enemies. To approach the questions which\r\ninevitably arise between them solely from the standpoint which treats\r\neach side in the mass as the enemy of the other side in the mass is\r\nboth wicked and foolish. In the past the most direful among the\r\ninfluences which have brought about the downfall of republics has ever\r\nbeen the growth of the class spirit, the growth of the spirit which\r\ntends to make a man subordinate the welfare of the public as a whole to\r\nthe welfare of the particular class to which he belongs, the\r\nsubstitution of loyalty to a class for loyalty to the Nation. This\r\ninevitably brings about a tendency to treat each man not on his merits\r\nas an individual, but on his position as belonging to a certain class\r\nin the community. If such a spirit grows up in this Republic it will\r\nultimately prove fatal to us, as in the past it has proved fatal to\r\nevery community in which it has become dominant. Unless we continue to\r\nkeep a quick and lively sense of the great fundamental truth that our\r\nconcern is with the individual worth of the individual man, this\r\nGovernment cannot permanently hold the place which it has achieved\r\namong the nations. The vital lines of cleavage among our people do not\r\ncorrespond, and indeed run at right angles to, the lines of cleavage\r\nwhich divide occupation from occupation, which divide wage-workers from\r\ncapitalists, farmers from bankers, men of small means from men of large\r\nmeans, men who live in the towns from men who live in the country; for\r\nthe vital line of cleavage is the line which divides the honest man who\r\ntries to do well by his neighbor from the dishonest man who does ill by\r\nhis neighbor. In other words, the standard we should establish is the\r\nstandard of conduct, not the standard of occupation, of means, or of\r\nsocial position. It is the man's moral quality, his attitude toward the\r\ngreat questions which concern all humanity, his cleanliness of life,\r\nhis power to do his duty toward himself and toward others, which really\r\ncount; and if we substitute for the standard of personal judgment which\r\ntreats each man according to his merits, another standard in accordance\r\nwith which all men of one class are favored and all men of another\r\nclass discriminated against, we shall do irreparable damage to the body\r\npolitic. I believe that our people are too sane, too self-respecting,\r\ntoo fit for self-government, ever to adopt such an attitude. This\r\nGovernment is not and never shall be government by a plutocracy. This\r\nGovernment is not and never shall be government by a mob. It shall\r\ncontinue to be in the future what it has been in the past, a Government\r\nbased on the theory that each man, rich or poor, is to be treated\r\nsimply and solely on his worth as a man, that all his personal and\r\nproperty rights are to be safeguarded, and that he is neither to wrong\r\nothers nor to suffer wrong from others.\r\n\r\nThe noblest of all forms of government is self-government; but it is\r\nalso the most difficult. We who possess this priceless boon, and who\r\ndesire to hand it on to our children and our children's children,\r\nshould ever bear in mind the thought so finely expressed by Burke: \"Men\r\nare qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their\r\ndisposition to put moral chains upon their own appetites; in proportion\r\nas they are disposed to listen to the counsels of the wise and good in\r\npreference to the flattery of knaves. Society cannot exist unless a\r\ncontrolling power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere, and the\r\nless of it there be within the more there must be without. It is\r\nordained in the eternal constitution of things that men of intemperate\r\nminds cannot be free. Their passions forge their fetters.\"\r\n\r\nThe great insurance companies afford striking examples of corporations\r\nwhose business has extended so far beyond the jurisdiction of the\r\nStates which created them as to preclude strict enforcement of\r\nsupervision and regulation by the parent States. In my last annual\r\nmessage I recommended \"that the Congress carefully consider whether the\r\npower of the Bureau of Corporations cannot constitutionally be extended\r\nto cover interstate transactions in insurance.\"\r\n\r\nRecent events have emphasized the importance of an early and exhaustive\r\nconsideration of this question, to see whether it is not possible to\r\nfurnish better safeguards than the several States have been able to\r\nfurnish against corruption of the flagrant kind which has been exposed.\r\nIt has been only too clearly shown that certain of the men at the head\r\nof these large corporations take but small note of the ethical\r\ndistinction between honesty and dishonesty; they draw the line only\r\nthis side of what may be called law-honesty, the kind of honesty\r\nnecessary in order to avoid falling into the clutches of the law. Of\r\ncourse the only complete remedy for this condition must be found in an\r\naroused public conscience, a higher sense of ethical conduct in the\r\ncommunity at large, and especially among business men and in the great\r\nprofession of the law, and in the growth of a spirit which condemns all\r\ndishonesty, whether in rich man or in poor man, whether it takes the\r\nshape of bribery or of blackmail. But much can be done by legislation\r\nwhich is not only drastic but practical. There is need of a far\r\nstricter and more uniform regulation of the vast insurance interests of\r\nthis country. The United States should in this respect follow the\r\npolicy of other nations by providing adequate national supervision of\r\ncommercial interests which are clearly national in character. My\r\npredecessors have repeatedly recognized that the foreign business of\r\nthese companies is an important part of our foreign commercial\r\nrelations. During the administrations of Presidents Cleveland,\r\nHarrison, and McKinley the State Department exercised its influence,\r\nthrough diplomatic channels, to prevent unjust discrimination by\r\nforeign countries against American insurance companies. These\r\nnegotiations illustrated the propriety of the Congress recognizing the\r\nNational character of insurance, for in the absence of Federal\r\nlegislation the State Department could only give expression to the\r\nwishes of the authorities of the several States, whose policy was\r\nineffective through want of uniformity.\r\n\r\nI repeat my previous recommendation that the Congress should also\r\nconsider whether the Federal Government has any power or owes any duty\r\nwith respect to domestic transactions in insurance of an interstate\r\ncharacter. That State supervision has proved inadequate is generally\r\nconceded. The burden upon insurance companies, and therefore their\r\npolicy holders, of conflicting regulations of many States, is\r\nunquestioned, while but little effective check is imposed upon any able\r\nand unscrupulous man who desires to exploit the company in his own\r\ninterest at the expense of the policy holders and of the public. The\r\ninability of a State to regulate effectively insurance corporations\r\ncreated under the laws of other States and transacting the larger part\r\nof their business elsewhere is also clear. As a remedy for this evil of\r\nconflicting, ineffective, and yet burdensome regulations there has been\r\nfor many years a widespread demand for Federal supervision. The\r\nCongress has already recognized that interstate insurance may be a\r\nproper subject for Federal legislation, for in creating the Bureau of\r\nCorporations it authorized it to publish and supply useful information\r\nconcerning interstate corporations, \"including corporations engaged in\r\ninsurance.\" It is obvious that if the compilation of statistics be the\r\nlimit of the Federal power it is wholly ineffective to regulate this\r\nform of commercial intercourse between the States, and as the insurance\r\nbusiness has outgrown in magnitude the possibility of adequate State\r\nsupervision, the Congress should carefully consider whether further\r\nlegislation can be bad. What is said above applies with equal force to\r\nfraternal and benevolent organizations which contract for life\r\ninsurance.\r\n\r\nThere is more need of stability than of the attempt to attain an ideal\r\nperfection in the methods of raising revenue; and the shock and strain\r\nto the business world certain to attend any serious change in these\r\nmethods render such change inadvisable unless for grave reason. It is\r\nnot possible to lay down any general rule by which to determine the\r\nmoment when the reasons for will outweigh the reasons against such a\r\nchange. Much must depend, not merely on the needs, but on the desires,\r\nof the people as a whole; for needs and desires are not necessarily\r\nidentical. Of course, no change can be made on lines beneficial to, or\r\ndesired by, one section or one State only. There must be something like\r\na general agreement among the citizens of the several States, as\r\nrepresented in the Congress, that the change is needed and desired in\r\nthe interest of the people, as a whole; and there should then be a\r\nsincere, intelligent, and disinterested effort to make it in such shape\r\nas will combine, so far as possible, the maximum of good to the people\r\nat large with the minimum of necessary disregard for the special\r\ninterests of localities or classes. But in time of peace the revenue\r\nmust on the average, taking a series of years together, equal the\r\nexpenditures or else the revenues must be increased. Last year there\r\nwas a deficit. Unless our expenditures can be kept within the revenues\r\nthen our revenue laws must be readjusted. It is as yet too early to\r\nattempt to outline what shape such a readjustment should take, for it\r\nis as yet too early to say whether there will be need for it. It should\r\nbe considered whether it is not desirable that the tariff laws should\r\nprovide for applying as against or in favor of any other nation maximum\r\nand minimum tariff rates established by the Congress, so as to secure a\r\ncertain reciprocity of treatment between other nations and ourselves.\r\nHaving in view even larger considerations of policy than those of a\r\npurely economic nature, it would, in my judgment, be well to endeavor\r\nto bring about closer commercial connections with the other peoples of\r\nthis continent. I am happy to be able to announce to you that Russia\r\nnow treats us on the most-favored-nation basis.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend to Congress the need of economy and to this end\r\nof a rigid scrutiny of appropriations. As examples merely, I call your\r\nattention to one or two specific matters. All unnecessary offices\r\nshould be abolished. The Commissioner of the General Land Office\r\nrecommends the abolishment of the office of Receiver of Public Moneys\r\nfor the United States Land Office. This will effect a saving of about a\r\nquarter of a million dollars a year. As the business of the Nation\r\ngrows, it is inevitable that there should be from time to time a\r\nlegitimate increase in the number of officials, and this fact renders\r\nit all the more important that when offices become unnecessary they\r\nshould be abolished. In the public printing also a large saving of\r\npublic money can be made. There is a constantly growing tendency to\r\npublish masses of unimportant information. It is probably not unfair to\r\nsay that many tens of thousands of volumes are published at which no\r\nhuman being ever looks and for which there is no real demand whatever.\r\n\r\nYet, in speaking of economy, I must in no wise be understood as\r\nadvocating the false economy which is in the end the worst\r\nextravagance. To cut down on the navy, for instance, would be a crime\r\nagainst the Nation. To fail to push forward all work on the Panama\r\nCanal would be as great a folly.\r\n\r\nIn my message of December 2, 1902, to the Congress I said:\r\n\r\n\"Interest rates are a potent factor in business activity, and in order\r\nthat these rates may be equalized to meet the varying needs of the\r\nseasons and of widely separated communities, and to prevent the\r\nrecurrence of financial stringencies, which injuriously affect\r\nlegitimate business, it is necessary that there should be an element of\r\nelasticity in our monetary system. Banks are the natural servants of\r\ncommerce, and, upon them should be placed, as far as practicable, the\r\nburden of furnishing and maintaining a circulation adequate to supply\r\nthe needs of our diversified industries and of our domestic and foreign\r\ncommerce; and the issue of this should be so regulated that a\r\nsufficient supply should be always available for the business interests\r\nof the country.\"\r\n\r\nEvery consideration of prudence demands the addition of the element of\r\nelasticity to our currency system. The evil does not consist in an\r\ninadequate volume of money, but in the rigidity of this volume, which\r\ndoes not respond as it should to the varying needs of communities and\r\nof seasons. Inflation must be avoided; but some provision should be\r\nmade that will insure a larger volume of money during the Fall and\r\nWinter months than in the less active seasons of the year; so that the\r\ncurrency will contract against speculation, and will expand for the\r\nneeds of legitimate business. At present the Treasury Department is at\r\nirregularly recurring intervals obliged, in the interest of the\r\nbusiness world--that is, in the interests of the American public--to\r\ntry to avert financial crises by providing a remedy which should be\r\nprovided by Congressional action.\r\n\r\nAt various times I have instituted investigations into the organization\r\nand conduct of the business of the executive departments. While none of\r\nthese inquiries have yet progressed far enough to warrant final\r\nconclusions, they have already confirmed and emphasized the general\r\nimpression that the organization of the departments is often faulty in\r\nprinciple and wasteful in results, while many of their business methods\r\nare antiquated and inefficient. There is every reason why our executive\r\ngovernmental machinery should be at least as well planned, economical,\r\nand efficient as the best machinery of the great business\r\norganizations, which at present is not the case. To make it so is a\r\ntask of complex detail and essentially executive in its nature;\r\nprobably no legislative body, no matter how wise and able, could\r\nundertake it with reasonable prospect of success. I recommend that the\r\nCongress consider this subject with a view to provide by legislation\r\nfor the transfer, distribution, consolidation, and assignment of duties\r\nand executive organizations or parts of organizations, and for the\r\nchanges in business methods, within or between the several departments,\r\nthat will best promote the economy, efficiency, and high character of\r\nthe Government work.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I said:\r\n\r\n\"The power of the Government to protect the integrity of the elections\r\nof its own officials is inherent and has been recognized and affirmed\r\nby repeated declarations of the Supreme Court. There is no enemy of\r\nfree government more dangerous and none so insidious as the corruption\r\nof the electorate. No one defends or excuses corruption, and it would\r\nseem to follow that none would oppose vigorous measures to eradicate\r\nit. I recommend the enactment of a law directed against bribery and\r\ncorruption in Federal elections. The details of such a law may be\r\nsafely left to the wise discretion of the Congress, but it should go as\r\nfar as under the Constitution it is possible to go, and should include\r\nsevere penalties against him who gives or receives a bribe intended to\r\ninfluence his act or opinion as an elector; and provisions for the\r\npublication not only of the expenditures for nominations and elections\r\nof all candidates, but also of all contributions received and\r\nexpenditures made by political committees.\"\r\n\r\nI desire to repeat this recommendation. In political campaigns in a\r\ncountry as large and populous as ours it is inevitable that there\r\nshould be much expense of an entirely legitimate kind. This, of course,\r\nmeans that many contributions, and some of them of large size, must be\r\nmade, and, as a matter of fact, in any big political contest such\r\ncontributions are always made to both sides. It is entirely proper both\r\nto give and receive them, unless there is an improper motive connected\r\nwith either gift or reception. If they are extorted by any kind of\r\npressure or promise, express or implied, direct or indirect, in the way\r\nof favor or immunity, then the giving or receiving becomes not only\r\nimproper but criminal. It will undoubtedly be difficult, as a matter of\r\npractical detail, to shape an act which shall guard with reasonable\r\ncertainty against such misconduct; but if it is possible to secure by\r\nlaw the full and verified publication in detail of all the sums\r\ncontributed to and expended by the candidates or committees of any\r\npolitical parties, the result cannot but be wholesome. All\r\ncontributions by corporations to any political committee or for any\r\npolitical purpose should be forbidden by law; directors should not be\r\npermitted to use stockholders' money for such purposes; and, moreover,\r\na prohibition of this kind would be, as far as it went, an effective\r\nmethod of stopping the evils aimed at in corrupt practices acts. Not\r\nonly should both the National and the several State Legislatures forbid\r\nany officer of a corporation from using the money of the corporation in\r\nor about any election, but they should also forbid such use of money in\r\nconnection with any legislation save by the employment of counsel in\r\npublic manner for distinctly legal services.\r\n\r\nThe first conference of nations held at The Hague in 1899, being unable\r\nto dispose of all the business before it, recommended the consideration\r\nand settlement of a number of important questions by another conference\r\nto be called subsequently and at an early date. These questions were\r\nthe following: (1) The rights and duties of neutrals; (2) the\r\nlimitation of the armed forces on land and sea, and of military\r\nbudgets; (3) the use of new types and calibres of military and naval\r\nguns; (4) the inviolability of private property at sea in times of war;\r\n(5) the bombardment of ports, cities, and villages by naval forces. In\r\nOctober, 1904, at the instance of the Interparliamentary Union, which,\r\nat a conference held in the United States, and attended by the\r\nlawmakers of fifteen different nations, had reiterated the demand for a\r\nsecond conference of nations, I issued invitations to all the powers\r\nsignatory to The Hague Convention to send delegates to such a\r\nconference, and suggested that it be again held at The Hague. In its\r\nnote of December 16, 1904, the United States Government communicated to\r\nthe representatives of foreign governments its belief that the\r\nconference could be best arranged under the provisions of the present\r\nHague treaty.\r\n\r\nFrom all the powers acceptance was received, coupled in some cases with\r\nthe condition that we should wait until the end of the war then waging\r\nbetween Russia and Japan. The Emperor of Russia, immediately after the\r\ntreaty of peace which so happily terminated this war, in a note\r\npresented to the President on September 13, through Ambassador Rosen,\r\ntook the initiative in recommending that the conference be now called.\r\nThe United States Government in response expressed its cordial\r\nacquiescence, and stated that it would, as a matter of course, take\r\npart in the new conference and endeavor to further its aims. We assume\r\nthat all civilized governments will support the movement, and that the\r\nconference is now an assured fact. This Government will do everything\r\nin its power to secure the success of the conference, to the end that\r\nsubstantial progress may be made in the cause of international peace,\r\njustice, and good will.\r\n\r\nThis renders it proper at this time to say something as to the general\r\nattitude of this Government toward peace. More and more war is coming\r\nto be looked upon as in itself a lamentable and evil thing. A wanton or\r\nuseless war, or a war of mere aggression--in short, any war begun or\r\ncarried on in a conscienceless spirit, is to be condemned as a\r\npeculiarly atrocious crime against all humanity. We can, however, do\r\nnothing of permanent value for peace unless we keep ever clearly in\r\nmind the ethical element which lies at the root of the problem. Our aim\r\nis righteousness. Peace is normally the hand-maiden of rightousness;\r\nbut when peace and righteousness conflict then a great and upright\r\npeople can never for a moment hesitate to follow the path which leads\r\ntoward righteousness, even though that path also leads to war. There\r\nare persons who advocate peace at any price; there are others who,\r\nfollowing a false analogy, think that because it is no longer necessary\r\nin civilized countries for individuals to protect their rights with a\r\nstrong hand, it is therefore unnecessary for nations to be ready to\r\ndefend their rights. These persons would do irreparable harm to any\r\nnation that adopted their principles, and even as it is they seriously\r\nhamper the cause which they advocate by tending to render it absurd in\r\nthe eyes of sensible and patriotic men. There can be no worse foe of\r\nmankind in general, and of his own country in particular, than the\r\ndemagogue of war, the man who in mere folly or to serve his own selfish\r\nends continually rails at and abuses other nations, who seeks to excite\r\nhis countrymen against foreigners on insufficient pretexts, who excites\r\nand inflames a perverse and aggressive national vanity, and who may on\r\noccasions wantonly bring on conflict between his nation and some other\r\nnation. But there are demagogues of peace just as there are demagogues\r\nof war, and in any such movement as this for The Hague conference it is\r\nessential not to be misled by one set of extremists any more than by\r\nthe other. Whenever it is possible for a nation or an individual to\r\nwork for real peace, assuredly it is failure of duty not so to strive,\r\nbut if war is necessary and righteous then either the man or the nation\r\nshrinking from it forfeits all title to self-respect. We have scant\r\nsympathy with the sentimentalist who dreads oppression less than\r\nphysical suffering, who would prefer a shameful peace to the pain and\r\ntoil sometimes lamentably necessary in order to secure a righteous\r\npeace. As yet there is only a partial and imperfect analogy between\r\ninternational law and internal or municipal law, because there is no\r\nsanction of force for executing the former while there is in the case\r\nof the latter. The private citizen is protected in his rights by the\r\nlaw, because the law rests in the last resort upon force exercised\r\nthrough the forms of law. A man does not have to defend his rights with\r\nhis own hand, because he can call upon the police, upon the sheriff's\r\nposse, upon the militia, or in certain extreme cases upon the army, to\r\ndefend him. But there is no such sanction of force for international\r\nlaw. At present there could be no greater calamity than for the free\r\npeoples, the enlightened, independent, and peace-loving peoples, to\r\ndisarm while yet leaving it open to any barbarism or despotism to\r\nremain armed. So long as the world is as unorganized as now the armies\r\nand navies of those peoples who on the whole stand for justice, offer\r\nnot only the best, but the only possible, security for a just peace.\r\nFor instance, if the United States alone, or in company only with the\r\nother nations that on the whole tend to act justly, disarmed, we might\r\nsometimes avoid bloodshed, but we would cease to be of weight in\r\nsecuring the peace of justice--the real peace for which the most\r\nlaw-abiding and high-minded men must at times be willing to fight. As\r\nthe world is now, only that nation is equipped for peace that knows how\r\nto fight, and that will not shrink from fighting if ever the conditions\r\nbecome such that war is demanded in the name of the highest morality.\r\n\r\nSo much it is emphatically necessary to say in order both that the\r\nposition of the United States may not be misunderstood, and that a\r\ngenuine effort to bring nearer the day of the peace of justice among\r\nthe nations may not be hampered by a folly which, in striving to\r\nachieve the impossible, would render it hopeless to attempt the\r\nachievement of the practical. But, while recognizing most clearly all\r\nabove set forth, it remains our clear duty to strive in every\r\npracticable way to bring nearer the time when the sword shall not be\r\nthe arbiter among nations. At present the practical thing to do is to\r\ntry to minimize the number of cases in which it must be the arbiter,\r\nand to offer, at least to all civilized powers, some substitute for war\r\nwhich will be available in at least a considerable number of instances.\r\nVery much can be done through another Hague conference in this\r\ndirection, and I most earnestly urge that this Nation do all in its\r\npower to try to further the movement and to make the result of the\r\ndecisions of The Hague conference effective. I earnestly hope that the\r\nconference may be able to devise some way to make arbitration between\r\nnations the customary way of settling international disputes in all\r\nsave a few classes of cases, which should themselves be as sharply\r\ndefined and rigidly limited as the present governmental and social\r\ndevelopment of the world will permit. If possible, there should be a\r\ngeneral arbitration treaty negotiated among all the nations represented\r\nat the conference. Neutral rights and property should be protected at\r\nsea as they are protected on land. There should be an international\r\nagreement to this purpose and a similar agreement defining contraband\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nDuring the last century there has been a distinct diminution in the\r\nnumber of wars between the most civilized nations. International\r\nrelations have become closer and the development of The Hague tribunal\r\nis not only a symptom of this growing closeness of relationship, but is\r\na means by which the growth can be furthered. Our aim should be from\r\ntime to time to take such steps as may be possible toward creating\r\nsomething like an organization of the civilized nations, because as the\r\nworld becomes more highly organized the need for navies and armies will\r\ndiminish. It is not possible to secure anything like an immediate\r\ndisarmament, because it would first be necessary to settle what peoples\r\nare on the whole a menace to the rest of mankind, and to provide\r\nagainst the disarmament of the rest being turned into a movement which\r\nwould really chiefly benefit these obnoxious peoples; but it may be\r\npossible to exercise some check upon the tendency to swell indefinitely\r\nthe budgets for military expenditure. Of course such an effort could\r\nsucceed only if it did not attempt to do too much; and if it were\r\nundertaken in a spirit of sanity as far removed as possible from a\r\nmerely hysterical pseudo-philanthropy. It is worth while pointing out\r\nthat since the end of the insurrection in the Philippines this Nation\r\nhas shown its practical faith in the policy of disarmament by reducing\r\nits little army one-third. But disarmament can never be of prime\r\nimportance; there is more need to get rid of the causes of war than of\r\nthe implements of war.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt much on the dangers to be avoided by steering clear of any\r\nmere foolish sentimentality because my wish for peace is so genuine and\r\nearnest; because I have a real and great desire that this second Hague\r\nconference may mark a long stride forward in the direction of securing\r\nthe peace of justice throughout the world. No object is better worthy\r\nthe attention of enlightened statesmanship than the establishment of a\r\nsurer method than now exists of securing justice as between nations,\r\nboth for the protection of the little nations and for the prevention of\r\nwar between the big nations. To this aim we should endeavor not only to\r\navert bloodshed, but, above all, effectively to strengthen the forces\r\nof right. The Golden Rule should be, and as the world grows in morality\r\nit will be, the guiding rule of conduct among nations as among\r\nindividuals; though the Golden Rule must not be construed, in fantastic\r\nmanner, as forbidding the exercise of the police power. This mighty and\r\nfree Republic should ever deal with all other States, great or small,\r\non a basis of high honor, respecting their rights as jealously as it\r\nsafeguards its own.\r\n\r\nOne of the most effective instruments for peace is the Monroe Doctrine\r\nas it has been and is being gradually developed by this Nation and\r\naccepted by other nations. No other policy could have been as efficient\r\nin promoting peace in the Western Hemisphere and in giving to each\r\nnation thereon the chance to develop along its own lines. If we had\r\nrefused to apply the doctrine to changing conditions it would now be\r\ncompletely outworn, would not meet any of the needs of the present day,\r\nand, indeed, would probably by this time have sunk into complete\r\noblivion. It is useful at home, and is meeting with recognition abroad\r\nbecause we have adapted our application of it to meet the growing and\r\nchanging needs of the hemisphere. When we announce a policy such as the\r\nMonroe Doctrine we thereby commit ourselves to the consequences of the\r\npolicy, and those consequences from time to time alter. It is out of\r\nthe question to claim a right and yet shirk the responsibility for its\r\nexercise. Not only we, but all American republics who are benefited by\r\nthe existence of the doctrine, must recognize the obligations each\r\nnation is under as regards foreign peoples no less than its duty to\r\ninsist upon its own rights.\r\n\r\nThat our rights and interests are deeply concerned in the maintenance\r\nof the doctrine is so clear as hardly to need argument. This is\r\nespecially true in view of the construction of the Panama Canal. As a\r\nmere matter of self-defense we must exercise a close watch over the\r\napproaches to this canal; and this means that we must be thoroughly\r\nalive to our interests in the Caribbean Sea.\r\n\r\nThere are certain essential points which must never be forgotten as\r\nregards the Monroe Doctrine. In the first place we must as a Nation\r\nmake it evident that we do not intend to treat it in any shape or way\r\nas an excuse for aggrandizement on our part at the expense of the\r\nrepublics to the south. We must recognize the fact that in some South\r\nAmerican countries there has been much suspicion lest we should\r\ninterpret the Monroe Doctrine as in some way inimical to their\r\ninterests, and we must try to convince all the other nations of this\r\ncontinent once and for all that no just and orderly Government has\r\nanything to fear from us. There are certain republics to the south of\r\nus which have already reached such a point of stability, order, and\r\nprosperity that they themselves, though as yet hardly consciously, are\r\namong the guarantors of this doctrine. These republics we now meet not\r\nonly on a basis of entire equality, but in a spirit of frank and\r\nrespectful friendship, which we hope is mutual. If all of the republics\r\nto the south of us will only grow as those to which I allude have\r\nalready grown, all need for us to be the especial champions of the\r\ndoctrine will disappear, for no stable and growing American Republic\r\nwishes to see some great non-American military power acquire territory\r\nin its neighborhood. All that this country desires is that the other\r\nrepublics on this continent shall be happy and prosperous; and they\r\ncannot be happy and prosperous unless they maintain order within their\r\nboundaries and behave with a just regard for their obligations toward\r\noutsiders. It must be understood that under no circumstances will the\r\nUnited States use the Monroe Doctrine as a cloak for territorial\r\naggression. We desire peace with all the world, but perhaps most of all\r\nwith the other peoples of the American Continent. There are, of course,\r\nlimits to the wrongs which any self-respecting nation can endure. It is\r\nalways possible that wrong actions toward this Nation, or toward\r\ncitizens of this Nation, in some State unable to keep order among its\r\nown people, unable to secure justice from outsiders, and unwilling to\r\ndo justice to those outsiders who treat it well, may result in our\r\nhaving to take action to protect our rights; but such action will not\r\nbe taken with a view to territorial aggression, and it will be taken at\r\nall only with extreme reluctance and when it has become evident that\r\nevery other resource has been exhausted.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we must make it evident that we do not intend to permit the\r\nMonroe Doctrine to be used by any nation on this Continent as a shield\r\nto protect it from the consequences of its own misdeeds against foreign\r\nnations. If a republic to the south of us commits a tort against a\r\nforeign nation, such as an outrage against a citizen of that nation,\r\nthen the Monroe Doctrine does not force us to interfere to prevent\r\npunishment of the tort, save to see that the punishment does not assume\r\nthe form of territorial occupation in any shape. The case is more\r\ndifficult when it refers to a contractual obligation. Our own\r\nGovernment has always refused to enforce such contractual obligations\r\non behalf, of its citizens by an appeal to arms. It is much to be\r\nwished that all foreign governments would take the same view. But they\r\ndo not; and in consequence we are liable at any time to be brought face\r\nto face with disagreeable alternatives. On the one hand, this country\r\nwould certainly decline to go to war to prevent a foreign government\r\nfrom collecting a just debt; on the other hand, it is very inadvisable\r\nto permit any foreign power to take possession, even temporarily, of\r\nthe custom houses of an American Republic in order to enforce the\r\npayment of its obligations; for such temporary occupation might turn\r\ninto a permanent occupation. The only escape from these alternatives\r\nmay at any time be that we must ourselves undertake to bring about some\r\narrangement by which so much as possible of a just obligation shall be\r\npaid. It is far better that this country should put through such an\r\narrangement, rather than allow any foreign country to undertake it. To\r\ndo so insures the defaulting republic from having to pay debt of an\r\nimproper character under duress, while it also insures honest creditors\r\nof the republic from being passed by in the interest of dishonest or\r\ngrasping creditors. Moreover, for the United States to take such a\r\nposition offers the only possible way of insuring us against a clash\r\nwith some foreign power. The position is, therefore, in the interest of\r\npeace as well as in the interest of justice. It is of benefit to our\r\npeople; it is of benefit to foreign peoples; and most of all it is\r\nreally of benefit to the people of the country concerned.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to what should be one of the fundamental objects of the\r\nMonroe Doctrine. We must ourselves in good faith try to help upward\r\ntoward peace and order those of our sister republics which need such\r\nhelp. Just as there has been a gradual growth of the ethical element in\r\nthe relations of one individual to another, so we are, even though\r\nslowly, more and more coming to recognize the duty of bearing one\r\nanother's burdens, not only as among individuals, but also as among\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nSanto Domingo, in her turn, has now made an appeal to us to help her,\r\nand not only every principle of wisdom but every generous instinct\r\nwithin us bids us respond to the appeal. It is not of the slightest\r\nconsequence whether we grant the aid needed by Santo Domingo as an\r\nincident to the wise development of the Monroe Doctrine or because we\r\nregard the case of Santo Domingo as standing wholly by itself, and to\r\nbe treated as such, and not on general principles or with any reference\r\nto the Monroe Doctrine. The important point is to give the needed aid,\r\nand the case is certainly sufficiently peculiar to deserve to be judged\r\npurely on its own merits. The conditions in Santo Domingo have for a\r\nnumber of years grown from bad to worse until a year ago all society\r\nwas on the verge of dissolution. Fortunately, just at this time a ruler\r\nsprang up in Santo Domingo, who, with his colleagues, saw the dangers\r\nthreatening their country and appealed to the friendship of the only\r\ngreat and powerful neighbor who possessed the power, and as they hoped\r\nalso the will to help them. There was imminent danger of foreign\r\nintervention. The previous rulers of Santo Domingo had recklessly\r\nincurred debts, and owing to her internal disorders she had ceased to\r\nbe able to provide means of paying the debts. The patience of her\r\nforeign creditors had become exhausted, and at least two foreign\r\nnations were on the point of intervention, and were only prevented from\r\nintervening by the unofficial assurance of this Government that it\r\nwould itself strive to help Santo Domingo in her hour of need. In the\r\ncase of one of these nations, only the actual opening of negotiations\r\nto this end by our Government prevented the seizure of territory in\r\nSanto Domingo by a European power. Of the debts incurred some were\r\njust, while some were not of a character which really renders it\r\nobligatory on or proper for Santo Domingo to pay them in full. But she\r\ncould not pay any of them unless some stability was assured her\r\nGovernment and people.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Executive Department of our Government negotiated a\r\ntreaty under which we are to try to help the Dominican people to\r\nstraighten out their finances. This treaty is pending before the\r\nSenate. In the meantime a temporary arrangement has been made which\r\nwill last until the Senate has had time to take action upon the treaty.\r\nUnder this arrangement the Dominican Government has appointed Americans\r\nto all the important positions in the customs service and they are\r\nseeing to the honest collection of the revenues, turning over 45 per\r\ncent. to the Government for running expenses and putting the other 55\r\nper cent. into a safe depository for equitable division in case the\r\ntreaty shall be ratified, among the various creditors, whether European\r\nor American.\r\n\r\nThe Custom Houses offer well-nigh the only sources of revenue in Santo\r\nDomingo, and the different revolutions usually have as their real aim\r\nthe obtaining of these Custom Houses. The mere fact that the Collectors\r\nof Customs are Americans, that they are performing their duties with\r\nefficiency and honesty, and that the treaty is pending in the Senate\r\ngives a certain moral power to the Government of Santo Domingo which it\r\nhas not had before. This has completely discouraged all revolutionary\r\nmovement, while it has already produced such an increase in the\r\nrevenues that the Government is actually getting more from the 45 per\r\ncent. that the American Collectors turn over to it than it got formerly\r\nwhen it took the entire revenue. It is enabling the poor, harassed\r\npeople of Santo Domingo once more to turn their attention to industry\r\nand to be free from the cure of interminable revolutionary disturbance.\r\nIt offers to all bona-fide creditors, American and European, the only\r\nreally good chance to obtain that to which they are justly entitled,\r\nwhile it in return gives to Santo Domingo the only opportunity of\r\ndefense against claims which it ought not to pay, for now if it meets\r\nthe views of the Senate we shall ourselves thoroughly examine all these\r\nclaims, whether American or foreign, and see that none that are\r\nimproper are paid. There is, of course, opposition to the treaty from\r\ndishonest creditors, foreign and American, and from the professional\r\nrevolutionists of the island itself. We have already reason to believe\r\nthat some of the creditors who do not dare expose their claims to\r\nhonest scrutiny are endeavoring to stir up sedition in the island and\r\nopposition to the treaty. In the meantime, I have exercised the\r\nauthority vested in me by the joint resolution of the Congress to\r\nprevent the introduction of arms into the island for revolutionary\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nUnder the course taken, stability and order and all the benefits of\r\npeace are at last coming to Santo Domingo, danger of foreign\r\nintervention has been suspended, and there is at last a prospect that\r\nall creditors will get justice, no more and no less. If the arrangement\r\nis terminated by the failure of the treaty chaos will follow; and if\r\nchaos follows, sooner or later this Government may be involved in\r\nserious difficulties with foreign Governments over the island, or else\r\nmay be forced itself to intervene in the island in some unpleasant\r\nfashion. Under the proposed treaty the independence of the island is\r\nscrupulously respected, the danger of violation of the Monroe Doctrine\r\nby the intervention of foreign powers vanishes, and the interference of\r\nour Government is minimized, so that we shall only act in conjunction\r\nwith the Santo Domingo authorities to secure the proper administration\r\nof the customs, and therefore to secure the payment of just debts and\r\nto secure the Dominican Government against demands for unjust debts.\r\nThe proposed method will give the people of Santo Domingo the same\r\nchance to move onward and upward which we have already given to the\r\npeople of Cuba. It will be doubly to our discredit as a Nation if we\r\nfail to take advantage of this chance; for it will be of damage to\r\nourselves, and it will be of incalculable damage to Santo Domingo.\r\nEvery consideration of wise policy, and, above all, every consideration\r\nof large generosity, bids us meet the request of Santo Domingo as we\r\nare now trying to meet it.\r\n\r\nWe cannot consider the question of our foreign policy without at the\r\nsame time treating of the Army and the Navy. We now have a very small\r\narmy indeed, one well-nigh infinitesimal when compared With the army of\r\nany other large nation. Of course the army we do have should be as\r\nnearly perfect of its kind and for its size as is possible. I do not\r\nbelieve that any army in the world has a better average of enlisted men\r\nor a better type of junior officer; but the army should be trained to\r\nact effectively in a mass. Provision should be made by sufficient\r\nappropriations for manoeuvers of a practical kind, so that the troops\r\nmay learn how to take care of themselves under actual service\r\nconditions; every march, for instance, being made with the soldier\r\nloaded exactly as he would be in active campaign. The Generals and\r\nColonels would thereby have opportunity of handling regiments,\r\nbrigades, and divisions, and the commissary and medical departments\r\nwould be tested in the field. Provision should be made for the exercise\r\nat least of a brigade and by preference of a division in marching and\r\nembarking at some point on our coast and disembarking at some other\r\npoint and continuing its march. The number of posts in which the army\r\nis kept in time of peace should be materially diminished and the posts\r\nthat are left made correspondingly larger. No local interests should be\r\nallowed to stand in the way of assembling the greater part of the\r\ntroops which would at need form our field armies in stations of such\r\nsize as will permit the best training to be given to the personnel of\r\nall grades, including the high officers and staff officers. To\r\naccomplish this end we must have not company or regimental garrisons,\r\nbut brigade and division garrisons. Promotion by mere seniority can\r\nnever result in a thoroughly efficient corps of officers in the higher\r\nranks unless there accompanies it a vigorous weeding-out process. Such\r\na weeding-out process--that is, such a process of selection--is a chief\r\nfeature of the four years' course of the young officer at West Point.\r\nThere is no good reason why it should stop immediately upon his\r\ngraduation. While at West Point he is dropped unless he comes up to a\r\ncertain standard of excellence, and when he graduates he takes rank in\r\nthe army according to his rank of graduation. The results are good at\r\nWest Point; and there should be in the army itself something that will\r\nachieve the same end. After a certain age has been reached the average\r\nofficer is unfit to do good work below a certain grade. Provision\r\nshould be made for the promotion of exceptionally meritorious men over\r\nthe heads of their comrades and for the retirement of all men who have\r\nreached a given age without getting beyond a given rank; this age of\r\nretirement of course changing from rank to rank. In both the army and\r\nthe navy there should be some principle of selection, that is, of\r\npromotion for merit, and there should be a resolute effort to eliminate\r\nthe aged officers of reputable character who possess no special\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nThere should be an increase in the coast artillery force, so that our\r\ncoast fortifications can be in some degree adequately manned. There is\r\nspecial need for an increase and reorganization of the Medical\r\nDepartment of the army. In both the army and navy there must be the\r\nsame thorough training for duty in the staff corps as in the fighting\r\nline. Only by such training in advance can we be sure that in actual\r\nwar field operations and those at sea will be carried on successfully.\r\nThe importance of this was shown conclusively in the Spanish-American\r\nand the Russo-Japanese wars. The work of the medical departments in the\r\nJapanese army and navy is especially worthy of study. I renew my\r\nrecommendation of January 9, 1905, as to the Medical Department of the\r\narmy and call attention to the equal importance of the needs of the\r\nstaff corps of the navy. In the Medical Department of the navy the\r\nfirst in importance is the reorganization of the Hospital Corps, on the\r\nlines of the Gallinger bill, (S. 3,984, February 1, 1904), and the\r\nreapportionment of the different grades of the medical officers to meet\r\nservice requirements. It seems advisable also that medical officers of\r\nthe army and navy should have similar rank and pay in their respective\r\ngrades, so that their duties can be carried on without friction when\r\nthey are brought together. The base hospitals of the navy should be put\r\nin condition to meet modern requirements and hospital ships be\r\nprovided. Unless we now provide with ample forethought for the medical\r\nneeds of the army and navy appalling suffering of a preventable kind is\r\nsure to occur if ever the country goes to war. It is not reasonable to\r\nexpect successful administration in time of war of a department which\r\nlacks a third of the number of officers necessary to perform the\r\nmedical service in time of peace. We need men who are not merely\r\ndoctors; they must be trained in the administration of military medical\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nOur navy must, relatively to the navies of other nations, always be of\r\ngreater size than our army. We have most wisely continued for a number\r\nof years to build up our navy, and it has now reached a fairly high\r\nstandard of efficiency. This standard of efficiency must not only be\r\nmaintained, but increased. It does not seem to be necessary, however,\r\nthat the navy should--at least in the immediate future--be increased\r\nbeyond the present number of units. What is now clearly necessary is to\r\nsubstitute efficient for inefficient units as the latter become worn\r\nout or as it becomes apparent that they are useless. Probably the\r\nresult would be attained by adding a single battleship to our navy each\r\nyear, the superseded or outworn vessels being laid up or broken up as\r\nthey are thus replaced. The four single-turret monitors built\r\nimmediately after the close of the Spanish war, for instance, are\r\nvessels which would be of but little use in the event of war. The money\r\nspent upon them could have been more usefully spent in other ways. Thus\r\nit would have been far better never to have built a single one of these\r\nmonitors and to have put the money into an ample supply of reserve\r\nguns. Most of the smaller cruisers and gunboats, though they serve a\r\nuseful purpose so far as they are needed for international police work,\r\nwould not add to the strength of our navy in a conflict with a serious\r\nfoe. There is urgent need of providing a large increase in the number\r\nof officers, and especially in the number of enlisted men.\r\n\r\nRecent naval history has emphasized certain lessons which ought not to,\r\nbut which do, need emphasis. Seagoing torpedo boats or destroyers are\r\nindispensable, not only for making night attacks by surprise upon an\r\nenemy, but even in battle for finishing already crippled ships. Under\r\nexceptional circumstances submarine boats would doubtless be of use.\r\nFast scouts are needed. The main strength of the navy, however, lies,\r\nand can only lie, in the great battleships, the heavily armored,\r\nheavily gunned vessels which decide the mastery of the seas.\r\nHeavy-armed cruisers also play a most useful part, and unarmed\r\ncruisers, if swift enough, are very useful as scouts. Between\r\nantagonists of approximately equal prowess the comparative perfection\r\nof the instruments of war will ordinarily determine the fight. But it\r\nis, of course, true that the man behind the gun, the man in the engine\r\nroom, and the man in the conning tower, considered not only\r\nindividually, but especially with regard to the way in which they work\r\ntogether, are even more important than the weapons with which they\r\nwork. The most formidable battleship is, of course, helpless against\r\neven a light cruiser if the men aboard it are unable to hit anything\r\nwith their guns, and thoroughly well-handled cruisers may count\r\nseriously in an engagement with much superior vessels, if the men\r\naboard the latter are ineffective, whether from lack of training or\r\nfrom any other cause. Modern warships are most formidable mechanisms\r\nwhen well handled, but they are utterly useless when not well handled,\r\nand they cannot be handled at all without long and careful training.\r\nThis training can under no circumstance be given when once war has\r\nbroken out. No fighting ship of the first class should ever be laid up\r\nsave for necessary repairs, and her crew should be kept constantly\r\nexercised on the high seas, so that she may stand at the highest point\r\nof perfection. To put a new and untrained crew upon the most powerful\r\nbattleship and send it out to meet a formidable enemy is not only to\r\ninvite, but to insure, disaster and disgrace. To improvise crews at the\r\noutbreak of a war, so far as the serious fighting craft are concerned,\r\nis absolutely hopeless. If the officers and men are not thoroughly\r\nskilled in, and have not been thoroughly trained to, their duties, it\r\nwould be far better to keep the ships in port during hostilities than\r\nto send them against a formidable opponent, for the result could only\r\nbe that they would be either sunk or captured. The marksmanship of our\r\nnavy is now on the whole in a gratifying condition, and there has been\r\na great improvement in fleet practice. We need additional seamen; we\r\nneed a large store of reserve guns; we need sufficient money for ample\r\ntarget practice, ample practice of every kind at sea. We should\r\nsubstitute for comparatively inefficient types--the old third-class\r\nbattleship Texas, the single-turreted monitors above mentioned, and,\r\nindeed, all the monitors and some of the old cruisers--efficient,\r\nmodern seagoing vessels. Seagoing torpedo-boat destroyers should be\r\nsubstituted for some of the smaller torpedo boats. During the present\r\nCongress there need be no additions to the aggregate number of units of\r\nthe navy. Our navy, though very small relatively to the navies of other\r\nnations, is for the present sufficient in point of numbers for our\r\nneeds, and while we must constantly strive to make its efficiency\r\nhigher, there need be no additions to the total of ships now built and\r\nbuilding, save in the way of substitution as above outlined. I\r\nrecommend the report of the Secretary of the Navy to the careful\r\nconsideration of the Congress, especially with a view to the\r\nlegislation therein advocated.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year evidence has accumulated to confirm the\r\nexpressions contained in my last two annual messages as to the\r\nimportance of revising by appropriate legislation our system of\r\nnaturalizing aliens. I appointed last March a commission to make a\r\ncareful examination of our naturalization laws, and to suggest\r\nappropriate measures to avoid the notorious abuses resulting from the\r\nimprovident of unlawful granting of citizenship. This commission,\r\ncomposed of an officer of the Department of State, of the Department of\r\nJustice, and of the Department of Commerce and Labor, has discharged\r\nthe duty imposed upon it, and has submitted a report, which will be\r\ntransmitted to the Congress for its consideration, and, I hope, for its\r\nfavor, able action.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing recommendations of the commission are:\r\n\r\nFirst--A Federal Bureau of Naturalization, to be established in the\r\nDepartment of Commerce and Labor, to supervise the administration of\r\nthe naturalization laws and to receive returns of naturalizations\r\npending and accomplished.\r\n\r\nSecond--Uniformity of naturalization certificates, fees to be charged,\r\nand procedure.\r\n\r\nThird--More exacting qualifications for citizenship.\r\n\r\nFourth--The preliminary declaration of intention to be abolished and no\r\nalien to be naturalized until at least ninety days after the filing of\r\nhis petition.\r\n\r\nFifth--Jurisdiction to naturalize aliens to be confined to United\r\nStates district courts and to such State courts as have jurisdiction in\r\ncivil actions in which the amount in controversy is unlimited; in\r\ncities of over 100,000 inhabitants the United States district courts to\r\nhave exclusive jurisdiction in the naturalization of the alien\r\nresidents of such cities.\r\n\r\nIn my last message I asked the attention of the Congress to the urgent\r\nneed of action to make our criminal law more effective; and I most\r\nearnestly request that you pay heed to the report of the Attorney\r\nGeneral on this subject. Centuries ago it was especially needful to\r\nthrow every safeguard round the accused. The danger then was lest he\r\nshould be wronged by the State. The danger is now exactly the reverse.\r\nOur laws and customs tell immensely in favor of the criminal and\r\nagainst the interests of the public he has wronged. Some antiquated and\r\noutworn rules which once safeguarded the threatened rights of private\r\ncitizens, now merely work harm to the general body politic. The\r\ncriminal law of the United States stands in urgent need of revision.\r\nThe criminal process of any court of the United States should run\r\nthroughout the entire territorial extent of our country. The delays of\r\nthe criminal law, no less than of the civil, now amount to a very great\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no statute of the United States which provides for\r\nthe punishment of a United States Attorney or other officer of the\r\nGovernment who corruptly agrees to wrongfully do or wrongfully refrain\r\nfrom doing any act when the consideration for such corrupt agreement is\r\nother than one possessing money value. This ought to be remedied by\r\nappropriate legislation. Legislation should also be enacted to cover\r\nexplicitly, unequivocally, and beyond question breach of trust in the\r\nshape of prematurely divulging official secrets by an officer or\r\nemploye of the United States, and to provide a suitable penalty\r\ntherefor. Such officer or employe owes the duty to the United States to\r\nguard carefully and not to divulge or in any manner use, prematurely,\r\ninformation which is accessible to the officer or employe by reason of\r\nhis official position. Most breaches of public trust are already\r\ncovered by the law, and this one should be. It is impossible, no matter\r\nhow much care is used, to prevent the occasional appointment to the\r\npublic service of a man who when tempted proves unfaithful; but every\r\nmeans should be provided to detect and every effort made to punish the\r\nwrongdoer. So far as in my power see each and every such wrongdoer\r\nshall be relentlessly hunted down; in no instance in the past has he\r\nbeen spared; in no instance in the future shall he be spared. His crime\r\nis a crime against every honest man in the Nation, for it is a crime\r\nagainst the whole body politic. Yet in dwelling on such misdeeds it is\r\nunjust not to add that they are altogether exceptional, and that on the\r\nwhole the employes of the Government render upright and faithful\r\nservice to the people. There are exceptions, notably in one or two\r\nbranches of the service, but at no time in the Nation's history has the\r\npublic service of the Nation taken as a whole stood on a higher plane\r\nthan now, alike as regards honesty and as regards efficiency.\r\n\r\nOnce again I call your attention to the condition of the public land\r\nlaws. Recent developments have given new urgency to the need for such\r\nchanges as will fit these laws to actual present conditions. The honest\r\ndisposal and right use of the remaining public lands is of fundamental\r\nimportance. The iniquitous methods by which the monopolizing of the\r\npublic lands is being brought about under the present laws are becoming\r\nmore generally known, but the existing laws do not furnish effective\r\nremedies. The recommendations of the Public Lands Commission upon this\r\nsubject are wise and should be given effect.\r\n\r\nThe creation of small irrigated farms under the Reclamation act is a\r\npowerful offset to the tendency of certain other laws to foster or\r\npermit monopoly of the land. Under that act the construction of great\r\nirrigation works has been proceeding rapidly and successfully, the\r\nlands reclaimed are eagerly taken up, and the prospect that the policy\r\nof National irrigation will accomplish all that was expected of it is\r\nbright. The act should be extended to include the State of Texas.\r\n\r\nThe Reclamation act derives much of its value from the fact that it\r\ntends to secure the greatest possible number of homes on the land, and\r\nto create communities of freeholders, in part by settlement on public\r\nlands, in part by forcing the subdivision of large private holdings\r\nbefore they can get water from Government irrigation works. The law\r\nrequires that no right to the use of water for land in private\r\nownership shall be sold for a tract exceeding 160 acres to any one land\r\nowner. This provision has excited active and powerful hostility, but\r\nthe success of the law itself depends on the wise and firm enforcement\r\nof it. We cannot afford to substitute tenants for freeholders on the\r\npublic domain.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the remaining public lands can not be irrigated.\r\nThey are at present and will probably always be of greater value for\r\ngrazing than for any other purpose. This fact has led to the grazing\r\nhomestead of 640 acres in Nebraska and to the proposed extension of it\r\nto other States. It is argued that a family can not be supported on 160\r\nacres of arid grazing land. This is obviously true, but neither can a\r\nfamily be supported on 640 acres of much of the land to which it is\r\nproposed to apply the grazing homestead. To establish universally any\r\nsuch arbitrary limit would be unwise at the present time. It would\r\nprobably result on the one hand in enlarging the holdings of some of\r\nthe great land owners, and on the other in needless suffering and\r\nfailure on the part of a very considerable proportion of the bona fide\r\nsettlers who give faith to the implied assurance of the Government that\r\nsuch an area is sufficient. The best use of the public grazing lands\r\nrequires the careful examination and classification of these lands in\r\norder to give each settler land enough to support his family and no\r\nmore. While this work is being done, and until the lands are settled,\r\nthe Government should take control of the open range, under reasonable\r\nregulations suited to local needs, following the general policy already\r\nin successful operation on the forest reserves. It is probable that the\r\npresent grazing value of the open public range is scarcely more than\r\nhalf what it once was or what it might easily be again under careful\r\nregulation.\r\n\r\nThe forest policy of the Administration appears to enjoy the unbroken\r\nsupport of the people. The great users of timber are themselves\r\nforwarding the movement for forest preservation. All organized\r\nopposition to the forest preserves in the West has disappeared. Since\r\nthe consolidation of all Government forest work in the National Forest\r\nService there has been a rapid and notable gain in the usefulness of\r\nthe forest reserves to the people and in public appreciation of their\r\nvalue. The National parks within or adjacent to forest reserves should\r\nbe transferred to the charge of the Forest Service also.\r\n\r\nThe National Government already does something in connection with the\r\nconstruction and maintenance of the great system of levees along the\r\nlower course of the Mississippi; in my judgment it should do much more.\r\n\r\nTo the spread of our trade in peace and the defense of our flag in war\r\na great and prosperous merchant marine is indispensable. We should have\r\nships of our own and seamen of our own to convey our goods to neutral\r\nmarkets, and in case of need to reinforce our battle line. It cannot\r\nbut be a source of regret and uneasiness to us that the lines of\r\ncommunication with our sister republics of South America should be\r\nchiefly under foreign control. It is not a good thing that American\r\nmerchants and manufacturers should have to send their goods and letters\r\nto South America via Europe if they wish security and dispatch. Even on\r\nthe Pacific, where our ships have held their own better than on the\r\nAtlantic, our merchant flag is now threatened through the liberal aid\r\nbestowed by other Governments on their own steam lines. I ask your\r\nearnest consideration of the report with which the Merchant Marine\r\nCommission has followed its long and careful inquiry.\r\n\r\nI again heartily commend to your favorable consideration the\r\ntercentennial celebration at Jamestown, Va. Appreciating the\r\ndesirability of this commemoration, the Congress passed an act, March\r\n3, 1905, authorizing in the year 1907, on and near the waters of\r\nHampton Roads, in the State of Virginia, an international naval,\r\nmarine, and military celebration in honor of this event. By the\r\nauthority vested in me by this act, I have made proclamation of said\r\ncelebration, and have issued, in conformity with its instructions,\r\ninvitations to all the nations of the earth to participate, by sending\r\ntheir naval vessels and such military organizations as may be\r\npracticable. This celebration would fail of its full purpose unless it\r\nwere enduring in its results and commensurate with the importance of\r\nthe event to be celebrated, the event from which our Nation dates its\r\nbirth. I earnestly hope that this celebration, already indorsed by the\r\nCongress of the United States, and by the Legislatures of sixteen\r\nStates since the action of the Congress, will receive such additional\r\naid at your hands as will make it worthy of the great event it is\r\nintended to celebrate, and thereby enable the Government of the United\r\nStates to make provision for the exhibition of its own resources, and\r\nlikewise enable our people who have undertaken the work of such a\r\ncelebration to provide suitable and proper entertainment and\r\ninstruction in the historic events of our country for all who may visit\r\nthe exposition and to whom we have tendered our hospitality.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of unmixed satisfaction once more to call attention to\r\nthe excellent work of the Pension Bureau; for the veterans of the civil\r\nwar have a greater claim upon us than any other class of our citizens.\r\nTo them, first of all among our people, honor is due.\r\n\r\nSeven years ago my lamented predecessor, President McKinley, stated\r\nthat the time had come for the Nation to care for the graves of the\r\nConfederate dead. I recommend that the Congress take action toward this\r\nend. The first need is to take charge of the graves of the Confederate\r\ndead who died in Northern prisons.\r\n\r\nThe question of immigration is of vital interest to this country. In\r\nthe year ending June 30, 1905, there came to the United States\r\n1,026,000 alien immigrants. In other words, in the single year that has\r\njust elapsed there came to this country a greater number of people than\r\ncame here during the one hundred and sixty-nine years of our Colonial\r\nlife which intervened between the first landing at Jamestown and the\r\nDeclaration of Independence. It is clearly shown in the report of the\r\nCommissioner General of Immigration that while much of this enormous\r\nimmigration is undoubtedly healthy and natural, a considerable\r\nproportion is undesirable from one reason or another; moreover, a\r\nconsiderable proportion of it, probably a very large proportion,\r\nincluding most of the undesirable class, does not come here of its own\r\ninitiative, but because of the activity of the agents of the great\r\ntransportation companies. These agents are distributed throughout\r\nEurope, and by the offer of all kinds of inducements they wheedle and\r\ncajole many immigrants, often against their best interest, to come\r\nhere. The most serious obstacle we have to encounter in the effort to\r\nsecure a proper regulation of the immigration to these shores arises\r\nfrom the determined opposition of the foreign steamship lines who have\r\nno interest whatever in the matter save to increase the returns on\r\ntheir capital by carrying masses of immigrants hither in the steerage\r\nquarters of their ships.\r\n\r\nAs I said in my last message to the Congress, we cannot have too much\r\nimmigration of the right sort and we should have none whatever of the\r\nwrong sort. Of course, it is desirable that even the right kind of\r\nimmigration should be properly distributed in this country. We need\r\nmore of such immigration for the South; and special effort should be\r\nmade to secure it. Perhaps it would be possible to limit the number of\r\nimmigrants allowed to come in any one year to New York and other\r\nNorthern cities, while leaving unlimited the number allowed to come to\r\nthe South; always provided, however, that a stricter effort is made to\r\nsee that only immigrants of the right kind come to our country\r\nanywhere. In actual practice it has proved so difficult to enforce the\r\nmigration laws where long stretches of frontier marked by an imaginary\r\nline alone intervene between us and our neighbors that I recommend that\r\nno immigrants be allowed to come in from Canada and Mexico save natives\r\nof the two countries themselves. As much as possible should be done to\r\ndistribute the immigrants upon the land and keep them away from the\r\ncontested tenement-house districts of the great cities. But\r\ndistribution is a palliative, not a cure. The prime need is to keep out\r\nall immigrants who will not make good American citizens. The laws now\r\nexisting for the exclusion of undesirable immigrants should be\r\nstrengthened. Adequate means should be adopted, enforced by sufficient\r\npenalties, to compel steamship companies engaged in the passenger\r\nbusiness to observe in good faith the law which forbids them to\r\nencourage or solicit immigration to the United States. Moreover, there\r\nshould be a sharp limitation imposed upon all vessels coming to our\r\nports as to the number of immigrants in ratio to the tonnage which each\r\nvessel can carry. This ratio should be high enough to insure the coming\r\nhither of as good a class of aliens as possible. Provision should be\r\nmade for the surer punishment of those who induce aliens to come to\r\nthis country under promise or assurance of employment. It should be\r\nmade possible to inflict a sufficiently heavy penalty on any employer\r\nviolating this law to deter him from taking the risk. It seems to me\r\nwise that there should be an international conference held to deal with\r\nthis question of immigration, which has more than a merely National\r\nsignificance; such a conference could, among other things, enter at\r\nlength into the method for securing a thorough inspection of would-be\r\nimmigrants at the ports from which they desire to embark before\r\npermitting them to embark.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with this question it is unwise to depart from the old\r\nAmerican tradition and to discriminate for or against any man who\r\ndesires to come here and become a citizen, save on the ground of that\r\nman's fitness for citizenship. It is our right and duty to consider his\r\nmoral and social quality. His standard of living should be such that he\r\nwill not, by pressure of competition, lower the standard of living of\r\nour own wage-workers; for it must ever be a prime object of our\r\nlegislation to keep high their standard of living. If the man who seeks\r\nto come here is from the moral and social standpoint of such a\r\ncharacter as to bid fair to add value to the community he should be\r\nheartily welcomed. We cannot afford to pay heed to whether he is of one\r\ncreed or another, of one nation, or another. We cannot afford to\r\nconsider whether he is Catholic or Protestant, Jew or Gentile; whether\r\nhe is Englishman or Irishman, Frenchman or German, Japanese, Italian,\r\nScandinavian, Slav, or Magyar. What we should desire to find out is the\r\nindividual quality of the individual man. In my judgment, with this end\r\nin view, we shall have to prepare through our own agents a far more\r\nrigid inspection in the countries from which the immigrants come. It\r\nwill be a great deal better to have fewer immigrants, but all of the\r\nright kind, than a great number of immigrants, many of whom are\r\nnecessarily of the wrong kind. As far as possible we wish to limit the\r\nimmigration to this country to persons who propose to become citizens\r\nof this country, and we can well afford to insist upon adequate\r\nscrutiny of the character of those who are thus proposed for future\r\ncitizenship. There should be an increase in the stringency of the laws\r\nto keep out insane, idiotic, epileptic, and pauper immigrants. But this\r\nis by no means enough. Not merely the Anarchist, but every man of\r\nAnarchistic tendencies, all violent and disorderly people, all people\r\nof bad character, the incompetent, the lazy, the vicious, the\r\nphysically unfit, defective, or degenerate should be kept out. The\r\nstocks out of which American citizenship is to be built should be\r\nstrong and healthy, sound in body, mind, and character. If it be\r\nobjected that the Government agents would not always select well, the\r\nanswer is that they would certainly select better than do the agents\r\nand brokers of foreign steamship companies, the people who now do\r\nwhatever selection is done.\r\n\r\nThe questions arising in connection with Chinese immigration stand by\r\nthemselves. The conditions in China are such that the entire Chinese\r\ncoolie class, that is, the class of Chinese laborers, skilled and\r\nunskilled, legitimately come under the head of undesirable immigrants\r\nto this country, because of their numbers, the low wages for which they\r\nwork, and their low standard of living. Not only is it to the interest\r\nof this country to keep them out, but the Chinese authorities do not\r\ndesire that they should be admitted. At present their entrance is\r\nprohibited by laws amply adequate to accomplish this purpose. These\r\nlaws have been, are being, and will be, thoroughly enforced. The\r\nviolations of them are so few in number as to be infinitesimal and can\r\nbe entirely disregarded. This is no serious proposal to alter the\r\nimmigration law as regards the Chinese laborer, skilled or unskilled,\r\nand there is no excuse for any man feeling or affecting to feel the\r\nslightest alarm on the subject.\r\n\r\nBut in the effort to carry out the policy of excluding Chinese\r\nlaborers, Chinese coolies, grave injustice and wrong have been done by\r\nthis Nation to the people of China, and therefore ultimately to this\r\nNation itself. Chinese students, business and professional men of all\r\nkinds--not only merchants, but bankers, doctors, manufacturers,\r\nprofessors, travelers, and the like--should be encouraged to come here,\r\nand treated on precisely the same footing that we treat students,\r\nbusiness men, travelers, and the like of other nations. Our laws and\r\ntreaties should be framed, not so as to put these people in the\r\nexcepted classes, but to state that we will admit all Chinese, except\r\nChinese of the coolie class, Chinese skilled or unskilled laborers.\r\nThere would not be the least danger that any such provision would\r\nresult in any relaxation of the law about laborers. These will, under\r\nall conditions, be kept out absolutely. But it will be more easy to see\r\nthat both justice and courtesy are shown, as they ought to be shown, to\r\nother Chinese, if the law or treaty is framed as above suggested.\r\nExaminations should be completed at the port of departure from China.\r\nFor this purpose there should be provided a more adequate Consular\r\nService in China than we now have. The appropriations both for the\r\noffices of the Consuls and for the office forces in the consulates\r\nshould be increased.\r\n\r\nAs a people we have talked much of the open door in China, and we\r\nexpect, and quite rightly intend to insist upon, justice being shown us\r\nby the Chinese. But we cannot expect to receive equity unless we do\r\nequity. We cannot ask the Chinese to do to us what we are unwilling to\r\ndo to them. They would have a perfect right to exclude our laboring men\r\nif our laboring men threatened to come into their country in such\r\nnumbers as to jeopardize the well-being of the Chinese population; and\r\nas, mutatis mutandis, these were the conditions with which Chinese\r\nimmigration actually brought this people face to face, we had and have\r\na perfect right, which the Chinese Government in no way contests, to\r\nact as we have acted in the matter of restricting coolie immigration.\r\nThat this right exists for each country was explicitly acknowledged in\r\nthe last treaty between the two countries. But we must treat the\r\nChinese student, traveler, and business man in a spirit of the broadest\r\njustice and courtesy if we expect similar treatment to be accorded to\r\nour own people of similar rank who go to China. Much trouble has come\r\nduring the past Summer from the organized boycott against American\r\ngoods which has been started in China. The main factor in producing\r\nthis boycott has been the resentment felt by the students and business\r\npeople of China, by all the Chinese leaders, against the harshness of\r\nour law toward educated Chinamen of the professional and business\r\nclasses.  This Government has the friendliest feeling for China and\r\ndesires China's well-being. We cordially sympathize with the announced\r\npurpose of Japan to stand for the integrity of China. Such an attitude\r\ntends to the peace of the world.\r\n\r\nThe civil service law has been on the statute books for twenty-two\r\nyears. Every President and a vast majority of heads of departments who\r\nhave been in office during that period have favored a gradual extension\r\nof the merit system. The more thoroughly its principles have been\r\nunderstood, the greater has been the favor with which the law has been\r\nregarded by administration officers. Any attempt to carry on the great\r\nexecutive departments of the Government without this law would\r\ninevitably result in chaos. The Civil Service Commissioners are doing\r\nexcellent work, and their compensation is inadequate considering the\r\nservice they perform.\r\n\r\nThe statement that the examinations are not practical in character is\r\nbased on a misapprehension of the practice of the Commission. The\r\ndepartments are invariably consulted as to the requirements desired and\r\nas to the character of questions that shall be asked. General\r\ninvitations are frequently sent out to all heads of departments asking\r\nwhether any changes in the scope or character of examinations are\r\nrequired. In other words, the departments prescribe the requirements\r\nand qualifications desired, and the Civil Service Commission\r\nco-operates with them in securing persons with these qualifications and\r\ninsuring open and impartial competition. In a large number of\r\nexaminations (as, for example, those for trades positions), there are\r\nno educational requirements whatever, and a person who can neither read\r\nnor write may pass with a high average. Vacancies in the service are\r\nfilled with reasonable expedition, and the machinery of the Commission,\r\nwhich reaches every part of the country, is the best agency that has\r\nyet been devised for finding people with the most suitable\r\nqualifications for the various offices to be filled. Written\r\ncompetitive examinations do not make an ideal method for filling\r\npositions, but they do represent an immeasurable advance upon the\r\n\"spoils\" method, under which outside politicians really make the\r\nappointments nominally made by the executive officers, the appointees\r\nbeing chosen by the politicians in question, in the great majority of\r\ncases, for reasons totally unconnected with the needs of the service or\r\nof the public.\r\n\r\nStatistics gathered by the Census Bureau show that the tenure of office\r\nin the Government service does not differ materially from that enjoyed\r\nby employes of large business corporations. Heads of executive\r\ndepartments and members of the Commission have called my attention to\r\nthe fact that the rule requiring a filing of charges and three days'\r\nnotice before an employe could be separated from the service for\r\ninefficiency has served no good purpose whatever, because that is not a\r\nmatter upon which a hearing of the employe found to be inefficient can\r\nbe of any value, and in practice the rule providing for such notice and\r\nhearing has merely resulted in keeping in a certain number of\r\nincompetents, because of the reluctance of the heads of departments and\r\nbureau chiefs to go through the required procedure. Experience has\r\nshown that this rule is wholly ineffective to save any man, if a\r\nsuperior for improper reasons wishes to remove him, and is mischievous\r\nbecause it sometimes serves to keep in the service incompetent men not\r\nguilty of specific wrongdoing. Having these facts in view the rule has\r\nbeen amended by providing that where the inefficiency or incapacity\r\ncomes within the personal knowledge of the head of a department the\r\nremoval may be made without notice, the reasons therefor being filed\r\nand made a record of the department. The absolute right of the removal\r\nrests where it always has rested, with the head of a department; any\r\nlimitation of this absolute right results in grave injury to the public\r\nservice. The change is merely one of procedure; it was much needed, and\r\nit is producing good results.\r\n\r\nThe civil service law is being energetically and impartially enforced,\r\nand in the large majority of cases complaints of violations of either\r\nthe law or rules are discovered to be unfounded. In this respect this\r\nlaw compares very favorably with any other Federal statute. The\r\nquestion of politics in the appointment and retention of the men\r\nengaged in merely ministerial work has been practically eliminated in\r\nalmost the entire field of Government employment covered by the civil\r\nservice law. The action of the Congress in providing the commission\r\nwith its own force instead of requiring it to rely on detailed clerks\r\nhas been justified by the increased work done at a smaller cost to the\r\nGovernment. I urge upon the Congress a careful consideration of the\r\nrecommendations contained in the annual report of the commission.\r\n\r\nOur copyright laws urgently need revision. They are imperfect in\r\ndefinition, confused and inconsistent in expression; they omit\r\nprovision for many articles which, under modern reproductive processes\r\nare entitled to protection; they impose hardships upon the copyright\r\nproprietor which are not essential to the fair protection of the\r\npublic; they are difficult for the courts to interpret and impossible\r\nfor the Copyright Office to administer with satisfaction to the public.\r\nAttempts to improve them by amendment have been frequent, no less than\r\ntwelve acts for the purpose having been passed since the Revised\r\nStatutes. To perfect them by further amendment seems impracticable. A\r\ncomplete revision of them is essential. Such a revision, to meet modern\r\nconditions, has been found necessary in Germany, Austria, Sweden, and\r\nother foreign countries, and bills embodying it are pending in England\r\nand the Australian colonies. It has been urged here, and proposals for\r\na commission to undertake it have, from time to time, been pressed upon\r\nthe Congress. The inconveniences of the present conditions being so\r\ngreat, an attempt to frame appropriate legislation has been made by the\r\nCopyright Office, which has called conferences of the various interests\r\nespecially and practically concerned with the operation of the\r\ncopyright laws. It has secured from them suggestions as to the changes\r\nnecessary; it has added from its own experience and investigations, and\r\nit has drafted a bill which embodies such of these changes and\r\nadditions as, after full discussion and expert criticism, appeared to\r\nbe sound and safe. In form this bill would replace the existing\r\ninsufficient and inconsistent laws by one general copyright statute. It\r\nwill be presented to the Congress at the coming session. It deserves\r\nprompt consideration.\r\n\r\nI recommend that a law be enacted to regulate inter-State commerce in\r\nmisbranded and adulterated foods, drinks, and drugs. Such law would\r\nprotect legitimate manufacture and commerce, and would tend to secure\r\nthe health and welfare of the consuming public. Traffic in food-stuffs\r\nwhich have been debased or adulterated so as to injure health or to\r\ndeceive purchasers should be forbidden.\r\n\r\nThe law forbidding the emission of dense black or gray smoke in the\r\ncity of Washington has been sustained by the courts. Something has been\r\naccomplished under it, but much remains to be done if we would preserve\r\nthe capital city from defacement by the smoke nuisance. Repeated\r\nprosecutions under the law have not had the desired effect. I recommend\r\nthat it be made more stringent by increasing both the minimum and\r\nmaximum fine; by providing for imprisonment in cases of repeated\r\nviolation, and by affording the remedy of injunction against the\r\ncontinuation of the operation of plants which are persistent offenders.\r\nI recommend, also, an increase in the number of inspectors, whose duty\r\nit shall be to detect violations of the act.\r\n\r\nI call your attention to the generous act of the State of California in\r\nconferring upon the United States Government the ownership of the\r\nYosemite Valley and the Mariposa Big Tree Grove. There should be no\r\ndelay in accepting the gift, and appropriations should be made for the\r\nincluding thereof in the Yosemite National Park, and for the care and\r\npolicing of the park. California has acted most wisely, as well as with\r\ngreat magnanimity, in the matter. There are certain mighty natural\r\nfeatures of our land which should be preserved in perpetuity for our\r\nchildren and our children's children. In my judgment, the Grand Canyon\r\nof the Colorado should be made into a National park. It is greatly to\r\nbe wished that the State of New York should copy as regards Niagara\r\nwhat the State of California has done as regards the Yosemite. Nothing\r\nshould be allowed to interfere with the preservation of Niagara Falls\r\nin all their beauty and majesty. If the State cannot see to this, then\r\nit is earnestly to be wished that she should be willing to turn it over\r\nto the National Government, which should in such case (if possible, in\r\nconjunction with the Canadian Government) assume the burden and\r\nresponsibility of preserving unharmed Niagara Falls; just as it should\r\ngladly assume a similar burden and responsibility for the Yosemite\r\nNational Park, and as it has already assumed them for the Yellowstone\r\nNational Park. Adequate provision should be made by the Congress for\r\nthe proper care and supervision of all these National parks. The\r\nboundaries of the Yellowstone National Park should be extended to the\r\nsouth and east, to take in such portions of the abutting forest\r\nreservations as will enable the Government to protect the elk on their\r\nWinter range.\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic animal of the Western plains was the great,\r\nshaggy-maned wild ox, the bison, commonly known as buffalo. Small\r\nfragments of herds exist in a domesticated state here and there, a few\r\nof them in the Yellowstone Park. Such a herd as that on the Flat-head\r\nReservation should not be allowed to go out of existence. Either on\r\nsome reservation or on some forest reserve like the Wichita reserve and\r\ngame refuge provision should be made for the preservation of such a\r\nherd. I believe that the scheme would be of economic advantage, for the\r\nrobe of the buffalo is of high market value, and the same is true of\r\nthe robe of the crossbred animals.\r\n\r\nI call your especial attention to the desirability of giving to the\r\nmembers of the Life Saving Service pensions such as are given to\r\nfiremen and policemen in all our great cities. The men in the Life\r\nSaving Service continually and in the most matter of fact way do deeds\r\nsuch as make Americans proud of their country. They have no political\r\ninfluence, and they live in such remote places that the really heroic\r\nservices they continually render receive the scantiest recognition from\r\nthe public. It is unjust for a great nation like this to permit these\r\nmen to become totally disabled or to meet death in the performance of\r\ntheir hazardous duty and yet to give them no sort of reward. If one of\r\nthem serves thirty years of his life in such a position he should\r\nsurely be entitled to retire on half pay, as a fireman or policeman\r\ndoes, and if he becomes totally incapacitated through accident or\r\nsickness, or loses his health in the discharge of his duty, he or his\r\nfamily should receive a pension just as any soldier should. I call your\r\nattention with especial earnestness to this matter because it appeals\r\nnot only to our judgment but to our sympathy; for the people on whose\r\nbehalf I ask it are comparatively few in number, render incalculable\r\nservice of a particularly dangerous kind, and have no one to speak for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nDuring the year just past, the phase of the Indian question which has\r\nbeen most sharply brought to public attention is the larger legal\r\nsignificance of the Indian's induction into citizenship. This has made\r\nitself manifest not only in a great access of litigation in which the\r\ncitizen Indian figures as a party defendant and in a more widespread\r\ndisposition to levy local taxation upon his personalty, but in a\r\ndecision of the United States Supreme Court which struck away the main\r\nprop on which has hitherto rested the Government's benevolent effort to\r\nprotect him against the evils of intemperance. The court holds, in\r\neffect, that when an Indian becomes, by virtue of an allotment of land\r\nto him, a citizen of the State in which his land is situated, he passes\r\nfrom under Federal control in such matters as this, and the acts of the\r\nCongress prohibiting the sale or gift to him of intoxicants become\r\nsubstantially inoperative. It is gratifying to note that the States and\r\nmunicipalities of the West which have most at stake in the welfare of\r\nthe Indians are taking up this subject and are trying to supply, in a\r\nmeasure at least, the abdication of its trusteeship forced upon the\r\nFederal Government. Nevertheless, I would urgently press upon the\r\nattention of the Congress the question whether some amendment of the\r\ninternal revenue laws might not be of aid in prosecuting those\r\nmalefactors, known in the Indian country as \"bootleggers,\" who are\r\nengaged at once in defrauding the United States Treasury of taxes and,\r\nwhat is far more important, in debauching the Indians by carrying\r\nliquors illicitly into territory still completely under Federal\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\nAmong the crying present needs of the Indians are more day schools\r\nsituated in the midst of their settlements, more effective instruction\r\nin the industries pursued on their own farms, and a more liberal\r\ntension of the field-matron service, which means the education of the\r\nIndian women in the arts of home making. Until the mothers are well\r\nstarted in the right direction we cannot reasonably expect much from\r\nthe children who are soon to form an integral part of our American\r\ncitizenship. Moreover the excuse continually advanced by male adult\r\nIndians for refusing offers of remunerative employment at a distance\r\nfrom their homes is that they dare not leave their families too long\r\nout of their sight. One effectual remedy for this state of things is to\r\nemploy the minds and strengthen the moral fibre of the Indian\r\nwomen--the end to which the work of the field matron is especially\r\ndirected. I trust that the Congress will make its appropriations for\r\nIndian day schools and field matrons as generous as may consist with\r\nthe other pressing demands upon its providence.\r\n\r\nDuring the last year the Philippine Islands have been slowly recovering\r\nfrom the series of disasters which, since American occupation, have\r\ngreatly reduced the amount of agricultural products below what was\r\nproduced in Spanish times. The war, the rinderpest, the locusts, the\r\ndrought, and the cholera have been united as causes to prevent a return\r\nof the prosperity much needed in the islands. The most serious is the\r\ndestruction by the rinderpest of more than 75 per cent of the draught\r\ncattle, because it will take several years of breeding to restore the\r\nnecessary number of these indispensable aids to agriculture. The\r\ncommission attempted to supply by purchase from adjoining countries the\r\nneeded cattle, but the experiments made were unsuccessful. Most of the\r\ncattle imported were unable to withstand the change of climate and the\r\nrigors of the voyage and died from other diseases than rinderpest.\r\n\r\nThe income of the Philippine Government has necessarily been reduced by\r\nreason of the business and agricultural depression in the islands, and\r\nthe Government has been obliged to exercise great economy to cut down\r\nits expenses, to reduce salaries, and in every way to avoid a deficit.\r\nIt has adopted an internal revenue law, imposing taxes on cigars,\r\ncigarettes, and distilled liquors, and abolishing the old Spanish\r\nindustrial taxes. The law has not operated as smoothly as was hoped,\r\nand although its principle is undoubtedly correct, it may need\r\namendments for the purpose of reconciling the people to its provisions.\r\nThe income derived from it has partly made up for the reduction in\r\ncustoms revenue.\r\n\r\nThere has been a marked increase in the number of Filipinos employed in\r\nthe civil service, and a corresponding decrease in the number of\r\nAmericans. The Government in every one of its departments has been\r\nrendered more efficient by elimination of undesirable material and the\r\npromotion of deserving public servants.\r\n\r\nImprovements of harbors, roads, and bridges continue, although the\r\ncutting down of the revenue forbids the expenditure of any great amount\r\nfrom current income for these purposes. Steps are being taken, by\r\nadvertisement for competitive bids, to secure the construction and\r\nmaintenance of 1,000 miles of railway by private corporations under the\r\nrecent enabling legislation of the Congress. The transfer of the friar\r\nlands, in accordance with the contract made some two years ago, has\r\nbeen completely effected, and the purchase money paid. Provision has\r\njust been made by statute for the speedy settlement in a special\r\nproceeding in the Supreme Court of controversies over the possession\r\nand title of church buildings and rectories arising between the Roman\r\nCatholic Church and schismatics claiming under ancient municipalities.\r\nNegotiations and hearings for the settlement of the amount due to the\r\nRoman Catholic Church for rent and occupation of churches and rectories\r\nby the army of the United States are in progress, and it is hoped a\r\nsatisfactory conclusion may be submitted to the Congress before the end\r\nof the session.\r\n\r\nTranquillity has existed during the past year throughout the\r\nArchipelago, except in the Province of Cavite, the Province of Batangas\r\nand the Province of Samar, and in the Island of Jolo among the Moros.\r\nThe Jolo disturbance was put an end to by several sharp and short\r\nengagements, and now peace prevails in the Moro Province, Cavite, the\r\nmother of ladrones in the Spanish times, is so permeated with the\r\ntraditional sympathy of the people for ladronism as to make it\r\ndifficult to stamp out the disease. Batangas was only disturbed by\r\nreason of the fugitive ladrones from Cavite, Samar was thrown into\r\ndisturbance by the uneducated and partly savage peoples living in the\r\nmountains, who, having been given by the municipal code more power than\r\nthey were able to exercise discreetly, elected municipal officers who\r\nabused their trusts, compelled the people raising hemp to sell it at a\r\nmuch less price than it was worth, and by their abuses drove their\r\npeople into resistance to constituted authority. Cavite and Samar are\r\ninstances of reposing too much confidence in the self-governing power\r\nof a people. The disturbances have all now been suppressed, and it is\r\nhoped that with these lessons local governments can be formed which\r\nwill secure quiet and peace to the deserving inhabitants. The incident\r\nis another proof of the fact that if there has been any error as\r\nregards giving self-government in the Philippines it has been in the\r\ndirection of giving it too quickly, not too slowly. A year from next\r\nApril the first legislative assembly for the islands will be held. On\r\nthe sanity and self-restraint of this body much will depend so far as\r\nthe future self-government of the islands is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe most encouraging feature of the whole situation has been the very\r\ngreat interest taken by the common people in education and the great\r\nincrease in the number of enrolled students in the public schools. The\r\nincrease was from 300,000 to half a million pupils. The average\r\nattendance is about 70 per cent. The only limit upon the number of\r\npupils seems to be the capacity of the government to furnish teachers\r\nand school houses.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural conditions of the islands enforce more strongly than\r\never the argument in favor of reducing the tariff on the products of\r\nthe Philippine Islands entering the United States. I earnestly\r\nrecommend that the tariff now imposed by the Dingley bill upon the\r\nproducts of the Philippine Islands be entirely removed, except the\r\ntariff on sugar and tobacco, and that that tariff be reduced to 25 per\r\ncent of the present rates under the Dingley act; that after July 1,\r\n1909, the tariff upon tobacco and sugar produced in the Philippine\r\nIslands be entirely removed, and that free trade between the islands\r\nand the United States in the products of each country then be provided\r\nfor by law.\r\n\r\nA statute in force, enacted April 15, 1904, suspends the operation of\r\nthe coastwise laws of the United States upon the trade between the\r\nPhilippine Islands and the United States until July 1, 1906. I\r\nearnestly recommend that this suspension be postponed until July 1,\r\n1909. I think it of doubtful utility to apply the coastwise laws to the\r\ntrade between the United States and the Philippines under any\r\ncircumstances, because I am convinced that it will do no good whatever\r\nto American bottoms, and will only interfere and be an obstacle to the\r\ntrade between the Philippines and the United States, but if the\r\ncoastwise law must be thus applied, certainly it ought not to have\r\neffect until free trade is enjoyed between the people of the United\r\nStates and the people of the Philippine Islands in their respective\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nI do not anticipate that free trade between the islands and the United\r\nStates will produce a revolution in the sugar and tobacco production of\r\nthe Philippine Islands. So primitive are the methods of agriculture in\r\nthe Philippine Islands, so slow is capital in going to the islands, so\r\nmany difficulties surround a large agricultural enterprise in the\r\nislands, that it will be many, many years before the products of those\r\nislands will have any effect whatever upon the markets of the United\r\nStates. The problem of labor is also a formidable one with the sugar\r\nand tobacco producers in the islands. The best friends of the Filipino\r\npeople and the people themselves are utterly opposed to the admission\r\nof Chinese coolie labor. Hence the only solution is the training of\r\nFilipino labor, and this will take a long time. The enactment of a law\r\nby the Congress of the United States making provision for free trade\r\nbetween the islands and the United States, however, will be of great\r\nimportance from a political and sentimental standpoint; and, while its\r\nactual benefit has doubtless been exaggerated by the people of the\r\nislands, they will accept this measure of justice as an indication that\r\nthe people of the United States are anxious to aid the people of the\r\nPhilippine Islands in every way, and especially in the agricultural\r\ndevelopment of their archipelago. It will aid the Filipinos without\r\ninjuring interests in America.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment immediate steps should be taken for the fortification of\r\nHawaii. This is the most important point in the Pacific to fortify in\r\norder to conserve the interests of this country. It would be hard to\r\noverstate the importance of this need. Hawaii is too heavily taxed.\r\nLaws should be enacted setting aside for a period of, say, twenty years\r\n75 per cent of the internal revenue and customs receipts from Hawaii as\r\na special fund to be expended in the islands for educational and public\r\nbuildings, and for harbor improvements and military and naval defenses.\r\nIt cannot be too often repeated that our aim must be to develop the\r\nterritory of Hawaii on traditional American lines. That territory has\r\nserious commercial and industrial problems to reckon with; but no\r\nmeasure of relief can be considered which looks to legislation\r\nadmitting Chinese and restricting them by statute to field labor and\r\ndomestic service. The status of servility can never again be tolerated\r\non American soil. We cannot concede that the proper solution of its\r\nproblems is special legislation admitting to Hawaii a class of laborers\r\ndenied admission to the other States and Territories. There are\r\nobstacles, and great obstacles, in the way of building up a\r\nrepresentative American community in the Hawaiian Islands; but it is\r\nnot in the American character to give up in the face of difficulty.\r\nMany an American Commonwealth has been built up against odds equal to\r\nthose that now confront Hawaii.\r\n\r\nNo merely half-hearted effort to meet its problems as other American\r\ncommunities have met theirs can be accepted as final. Hawaii shall\r\nnever become a territory in which a governing class of rich planters\r\nexists by means of coolie labor. Even if the rate of growth of the\r\nTerritory is thereby rendered slower, the growth must only take place\r\nby the admission of immigrants fit in the end to assume the duties and\r\nburdens of full American citizenship. Our aim must be to develop the\r\nTerritory on the same basis of stable citizenship as exists on this\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nI earnestly advocate the adoption of legislation which will explicitly\r\nconfer American citizenship on all citizens of Porto Rico. There is, in\r\nmy judgment, no excuse for failure to do this. The harbor of San Juan\r\nshould be dredged and improved. The expenses of the Federal Court of\r\nPorto Rico should be met from the Federal Treasury and not from the\r\nPorto Rican treasury. The elections in Porto Rico should take place\r\nevery four years, and the Legislature should meet in session every two\r\nyears. The present form of government in Porto Rico, which provides for\r\nthe appointment by the President of the members of the Executive\r\nCouncil or upper house of the Legislature, has proved satisfactory and\r\nhas inspired confidence in property owners and investors. I do not deem\r\nit advisable at the present time to change this form in any material\r\nfeature. The problems and needs of the island are industrial and\r\ncommercial rather than political.\r\n\r\nI wish to call the attention of the Congress to one question which\r\naffects our insular possessions generally; namely, the need of an\r\nincreased liberality in the treatment of the whole franchise question\r\nin these islands. In the proper desire to prevent the islands being\r\nexploited by speculators and to have them develop in the interests of\r\ntheir own people an error has been made in refusing to grant\r\nsufficiently liberal terms to induce the investment of American capital\r\nin the Philippines and in Porto Rico. Elsewhere in this message I have\r\nspoken strongly against the jealousy of mere wealth, and especially of\r\ncorporate wealth as such. But it is particularly regrettable to allow\r\nany such jealousy to be developed when we are dealing either with our\r\ninsular or with foreign affairs. The big corporation has achieved its\r\npresent position in the business world simply because it is the most\r\neffective instrument in business competition. In foreign affairs we\r\ncannot afford to put our people at a disadvantage with their\r\ncompetitors by in any way discriminating against the efficiency of our\r\nbusiness organizations. In the same way we cannot afford to allow our\r\ninsular possessions to lag behind in industrial development from any\r\ntwisted jealousy of business success. It is, of course, a mere truism\r\nto say that the business interests of the islands will only be\r\ndeveloped if it becomes the financial interest of somebody to develop\r\nthem. Yet this development is one of the things most earnestly to be\r\nwished for in the interest of the islands themselves. We have been\r\npaying all possible heed to the political and educational interests of\r\nthe islands, but, important though these objects are, it is not less\r\nimportant that we should favor their industrial development. The\r\nGovernment can in certain ways help this directly, as by building good\r\nroads; but the fundamental and vital help must be given through the\r\ndevelopment of the industries of the islands, and a most efficient\r\nmeans to this end is to encourage big American corporations to start\r\nindustries in them, and this means to make it advantageous for them to\r\ndo so. To limit the ownership of mining claims, as has been done in the\r\nPhilippines, is absurd. In both the Philippines and Porto Rico the\r\nlimit of holdings of land should be largely raised.\r\n\r\nI earnestly ask that Alaska be given an elective delegate. Some person\r\nshould be chosen who can speak with authority of the needs of the\r\nTerritory. The Government should aid in the construction of a railroad\r\nfrom the Gulf of Alaska to the Yukon River, in American territory. In\r\nmy last two messages I advocated certain additional action on behalf of\r\nAlaska. I shall not now repeat those recommendations, but I shall lay\r\nall my stress upon the one recommendation of giving to Alaska some one\r\nauthorized to speak for it. I should prefer that the delegate was made\r\nelective, but if this is not deemed wise, then make him appointive. At\r\nany rate, give Alaska some person whose business it shall be to speak\r\nwith authority on her behalf to the Congress. The natural resources of\r\nAlaska are great. Some of the chief needs of the peculiarly energetic,\r\nself-reliant, and typically American white population of Alaska were\r\nset forth in my last message. I also earnestly ask your attention to\r\nthe needs of the Alaskan Indians. All Indians who are competent should\r\nreceive the full rights of American citizenship. It is, for instance, a\r\ngross and indefensible wrong to deny to such hard-working,\r\ndecent-living Indians as the Metlakahtlas the right to obtain licenses\r\nas captains, pilots, and engineers; the right to enter mining claims,\r\nand to profit by the homestead law. These particular Indians are\r\ncivilized and are competent and entitled to be put on the same basis\r\nwith the white men round about them.\r\n\r\nI recommend that Indian Territory and Oklahoma be admitted as one State\r\nand that New Mexico and Arizona be admitted as one State. There is no\r\nobligation upon us to treat territorial subdivisions, which are matters\r\nof convenience only, as binding us on the question of admission to\r\nStatehood. Nothing has taken up more time in the Congress during the\r\npast few years than the question as to the Statehood to be granted to\r\nthe four Territories above mentioned, and after careful consideration\r\nof all that has been developed in the discussions of the question, I\r\nrecommend that they be immediately admitted as two States. There is no\r\njustification for further delay; and the advisability of making the\r\nfour Territories into two States has been clearly established.\r\n\r\nIn some of the Territories the legislative assemblies issue licenses\r\nfor gambling. The Congress should by law forbid this practice, the\r\nharmful results of which are obvious at a glance.\r\n\r\nThe treaty between the United States and the Republic of Panama, under\r\nwhich the construction of the Panama Canal was made possible, went into\r\neffect with its ratification by the United States Senate on February\r\n23, 1904. The canal properties of the French Canal Company were\r\ntransferred to the United States on April 23, 1904, on payment of\r\n$40,000,000 to that company. On April 1, 1905, the Commission was\r\nreorganized, and it now consists of Theodore P. Shonts, Chairman;\r\nCharles E. Magoon, Benjamin M. Harrod, Rear Admiral Mordecai T.\r\nEndicott, Brig. Gen. Peter C. Hains, and Col. Oswald H. Ernst. John F.\r\nStevens was appointed Chief Engineer on July 1 last. Active work in\r\ncanal construction, mainly preparatory, has been in progress for less\r\nthan a year and a half. During that period two points about the canal\r\nhave ceased to be open to debate: First, the question of route; the\r\ncanal will be built on the Isthmus of Panama. Second, the question of\r\nfeasibility; there are no physical obstacles on this route that\r\nAmerican engineering skill will not be able to overcome without serious\r\ndifficulty, or that will prevent the completion of the canal within a\r\nreasonable time and at a reasonable cost. This is virtually the\r\nunanimous testimony of the engineers who have investigated the matter\r\nfor the Government.\r\n\r\nThe point which remains unsettled is the question of type, whether the\r\ncanal shall be one of several locks above sea level, or at sea level\r\nwith a single tide lock. On this point I hope to lay before the\r\nCongress at an early day the findings of the Advisory Board of American\r\nand European Engineers, that at my invitation have been considering the\r\nsubject, together with the report of the Commission thereon, and such\r\ncomments thereon or recommendations in reference thereto as may seem\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe American people is pledged to the speediest possible construction\r\nof a canal adequate to meet the demands which the commerce of the world\r\nwill make upon it, and I appeal most earnestly to the Congress to aid\r\nin the fulfillment of the pledge. Gratifying progress has been made\r\nduring the past year, and especially during the past four months. The\r\ngreater part of the necessary preliminary work has been done. Actual\r\nwork of excavation could be begun only on a limited scale till the\r\nCanal Zone was made a healthful place to live in and to work in. The\r\nIsthmus had to be sanitated first. This task has been so thoroughly\r\naccomplished that yellow fever has been virtually extirpated from the\r\nIsthmus and general health conditions vastly improved. The same methods\r\nwhich converted the island of Cuba from a pest hole, which menaced the\r\nhealth of the world, into a healthful place of abode, have been applied\r\non the Isthmus with satisfactory results. There is no reason to doubt\r\nthat when the plans for water supply, paving, and sewerage of Panama\r\nand Colon and the large labor camps have been fully carried out, the\r\nIsthmus will be, for the tropics, an unusually healthy place of abode.\r\nThe work is so far advanced now that the health of all those employed\r\nin canal work is as well guarded as it is on similar work in this\r\ncountry and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn addition to sanitating the Isthmus, satisfactory quarters are being\r\nprovided for employes and an adequate system of supplying them with\r\nwholesome food at reasonable prices has been created. Hospitals have\r\nbeen established and equipped that are without their superiors of their\r\nkind anywhere. The country has thus been made fit to work in, and\r\nprovision has been made for the welfare and comfort of those who are to\r\ndo the work. During the past year a large portion of the plant with\r\nwhich the work is to be done has been ordered. It is confidently\r\nbelieved that by the middle of the approaching year a sufficient\r\nproportion of this plant will have been installed to enable us to\r\nresume the work of excavation on a large scale.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed now and without delay is an appropriation by the\r\nCongress to meet the current and accruing expenses of the commission.\r\nThe first appropriation of $10,000,000, out of the $135,000,000\r\nauthorized by the Spooner act, was made three years ago. It is nearly\r\nexhausted. There is barely enough of it remaining to carry the\r\ncommission to the end of the year. Unless the Congress shall\r\nappropriate before that time all work must cease. To arrest progress\r\nfor any length of time now, when matters are advancing so\r\nsatisfactorily, would be deplorable. There will be no money with which\r\nto meet pay roll obligations and none with which to meet bills coming\r\ndue for materials and supplies; and there will be demoralization of the\r\nforces, here and on the Isthmus, now working so harmoniously and\r\neffectively, if there is delay in granting an emergency appropriation.\r\nEstimates of the amount necessary will be found in the accompanying\r\nreports of the Secretary of War and the commission.\r\n\r\nI recommend more adequate provision than has been made heretofore for\r\nthe work of the Department of State. Within a few years there has been\r\na very great increase in the amount and importance of the work to be\r\ndone by that department, both in Washington and abroad. This has been\r\ncaused by the great increase of our foreign trade, the increase of\r\nwealth among our people, which enables them to travel more generally\r\nthan heretofore, the increase of American capital which is seeking\r\ninvestment in foreign countries, and the growth of our power and weight\r\nin the councils of the civilized world. There has been no corresponding\r\nincrease of facilities for doing the work afforded to the department\r\nhaving charge of our foreign relations.\r\n\r\nNeither at home nor abroad is there a sufficient working force to do\r\nthe business properly. In many respects the system which was adequate\r\nto the work of twenty-five years or even ten years ago, is inadequate\r\nnow, and should be changed. Our Consular force should be classified,\r\nand appointments should be made to the several classes, with authority\r\nto the Executive to assign the members of each class to duty at such\r\nposts as the interests of the service require, instead of the\r\nappointments being made as at present to specified posts. There should\r\nbe an adequate inspection service, so that the department may be able\r\nto inform itself how the business of each Consulate is being done,\r\ninstead of depending upon casual private information or rumor. The fee\r\nsystem should be entirely abolished, and a due equivalent made in\r\nsalary to the officers who now eke out their subsistence by means of\r\nfees. Sufficient provision should be made for a clerical force in every\r\nConsulate composed entirely of Americans, instead of the insufficient\r\nprovision now made, which compels the employment of great numbers of\r\ncitizens of foreign countries whose services can be obtained for less\r\nmoney. At a large part of our Consulates the office quarters and the\r\nclerical force are inadequate to the performance of the onerous duties\r\nimposed by the recent provisions of our immigration laws as well as by\r\nour increasing trade. In many parts of the world the lack of suitable\r\nquarters for our embassies, legations, and Consulates detracts from the\r\nrespect in which our officers ought to be held, and seriously impairs\r\ntheir weight and influence.\r\n\r\nSuitable provision should be made for the expense of keeping our\r\ndiplomatic officers more fully informed of what is being done from day\r\nto day in the progress of our diplomatic affairs with other countries.\r\nThe lack of such information, caused by insufficient appropriations\r\navailable for cable tolls and for clerical and messenger service,\r\nfrequently puts our officers at a great disadvantage and detracts from\r\ntheir usefulness. The salary list should be readjusted. It does not now\r\ncorrespond either to the importance of the service to be rendered and\r\nthe degrees of ability and experience required in the different\r\npositions, or to the differences in the cost of living. In many cases\r\nthe salaries are quite inadequate.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nTheodore Roosevelt\r\nDecember 3, 1906\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nAs a nation we still continue to enjoy a literally unprecedented\r\nprosperity; and it is probable that only reckless speculation and\r\ndisregard of legitimate business methods on the part of the business\r\nworld can materially mar this prosperity.\r\n\r\nNo Congress in our time has done more good work of importance than the\r\npresent Congress. There were several matters left unfinished at your\r\nlast session, however, which I most earnestly hope you will complete\r\nbefore your adjournment.\r\n\r\nI again recommend a law prohibiting all corporations from contributing\r\nto the campaign expenses of any party. Such a bill has already past one\r\nHouse of Congress. Let individuals contribute as they desire; but let\r\nus prohibit in effective fashion all corporations from making\r\ncontributions for any political purpose, directly or indirectly.\r\n\r\nAnother bill which has just past one House of the Congress and which it\r\nis urgently necessary should be enacted into law is that conferring\r\nupon the Government the right of appeal in criminal cases on questions\r\nof law. This right exists in many of the States; it exists in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia by act of the Congress. It is of course not\r\nproposed that in any case a verdict for the defendant on the merits\r\nshould be set aside. Recently in one district where the Government had\r\nindicted certain persons for conspiracy in connection with rebates, the\r\ncourt sustained the defendant's demurrer; while in another jurisdiction\r\nan indictment for conspiracy to obtain rebates has been sustained by\r\nthe court, convictions obtained under it, and two defendants sentenced\r\nto imprisonment. The two cases referred to may not be in real conflict\r\nwith each other, but it is unfortunate that there should even be an\r\napparent conflict. At present there is no way by which the Government\r\ncan cause such a conflict, when it occurs, to be solved by an appeal to\r\na higher court; and the wheels of justice are blocked without any real\r\ndecision of the question. I can not too strongly urge the passage of\r\nthe bill in question. A failure to pass it will result in seriously\r\nhampering the Government in its effort to obtain justice, especially\r\nagainst wealthy individuals or corporations who do wrong; and may also\r\nprevent the Government from obtaining justice for wage-workers who are\r\nnot themselves able effectively to contest a case where the judgment of\r\nan inferior court has been against them. I have specifically in view a\r\nrecent decision by a district judge leaving railway employees without\r\nremedy for violation of a certain so-called labor statute. It seems an\r\nabsurdity to permit a single district judge, against what may be the\r\njudgment of the immense majority of his colleagues on the bench,\r\nto declare a law solemnly enacted by the Congress to be\r\n\"unconstitutional,\" and then to deny to the Government the right to\r\nhave the Supreme Court definitely decide the question.\r\n\r\nIt is well to recollect that the real efficiency of the law often\r\ndepends not upon the passage of acts as to which there is great public\r\nexcitement, but upon the passage of acts of this nature as to which\r\nthere is not much public excitement, because there is little public\r\nunderstanding of their importance, while the interested parties are\r\nkeenly alive to the desirability of defeating them. The importance of\r\nenacting into law the particular bill in question is further increased\r\nby the fact that the Government has now definitely begun a policy of\r\nresorting to the criminal law in those trust and interstate commerce\r\ncases where such a course offers a reasonable chance of success. At\r\nfirst, as was proper, every effort was made to enforce these laws by\r\ncivil proceedings; but it has become increasingly evident that the\r\naction of the Government in finally deciding, in certain cases, to\r\nundertake criminal proceedings was justifiable; and though there have\r\nbeen some conspicuous failures in these cases, we have had many\r\nsuccesses, which have undoubtedly had a deterrent effect upon\r\nevil-doers, whether the penalty inflicted was in the shape of fine or\r\nimprisonment--and penalties of both kinds have already been inflicted\r\nby the courts. Of course, where the judge can see his way to inflict\r\nthe penalty of imprisonment the deterrent effect of the punishment on\r\nother offenders is increased; but sufficiently heavy fines accomplish\r\nmuch. Judge Holt, of the New York district court, in a recent decision\r\nadmirably stated the need for treating with just severity offenders of\r\nthis kind. His opinion runs in part as follows:\r\n\r\n'The Government's evidence to establish the defendant's guilt was\r\nclear, conclusive, and undisputed. The case was a flagrant one. The\r\ntransactions which took place under this illegal contract were very\r\nlarge; the amounts of rebates returned were considerable; and the\r\namount of the rebate itself was large, amounting to more than one-fifth\r\nof the entire tariff charge for the transportation of merchandise from\r\nthis city to Detroit. It is not too much to say, in my opinion, that if\r\nthis business was carried on for a considerable time on that\r\nbasis--that is, if this discrimination in favor of this particular\r\nshipper was made with an 18 instead of a 23 cent rate and the tariff\r\nrate was maintained as against their competitors--the result might be\r\nand not improbably would be that their competitors would be driven out\r\nof business. This crime is one which in its nature is deliberate and\r\npremeditated. I think over a fortnight elapsed between the date of\r\nPalmer's letter requesting the reduced rate and the answer of the\r\nrailroad company deciding to grant it, and then for months afterwards\r\nthis business was carried on and these claims for rebates submitted\r\nmonth after month and checks in payment of them drawn month after\r\nmonth. Such a violation of the law, in my opinion, in its essential\r\nnature, is a very much more heinous act than the ordinary common,\r\nvulgar crimes which come before criminal courts constantly for\r\npunishment and which arise from sudden passion or temptation. This\r\ncrime in this case was committed by men of education and of large\r\nbusiness experience, whose standing in the community was such that they\r\nmight have been expected to set an example of obedience to law upon the\r\nmaintenance of which alone in this country the security of their\r\nproperty depends. It was committed on behalf of a great railroad\r\ncorporation, which, like other railroad corporations, has received\r\ngratuitously from the State large and valuable privileges for the\r\npublic's convenience and its own, which performs quasi public functions\r\nand which is charged with the highest obligation in the transaction of\r\nits business to treat the citizens of this country alike, and not to\r\ncarry on its business with unjust discriminations between different\r\ncitizens or different classes of citizens. This crime in its nature is\r\none usually done with secrecy, and proof of which it is very difficult\r\nto obtain. The interstate commerce act was past in 1887, nearly twenty\r\nyears ago. Ever since that time complaints of the granting of rebates\r\nby railroads have been common, urgent, and insistent, and although the\r\nCongress has repeatedly past legislation endeavoring to put a stop to\r\nthis evil, the difficulty of obtaining proof upon which to bring\r\nprosecution in these cases is so great that this is the first case that\r\nhas ever been brought in this court, and, as I am formed, this case and\r\none recently brought in Philadelphia are the only cases that have ever\r\nbeen brought in the eastern part of this country. In fact, but few\r\ncases of this kind have ever been brought in this country, East or\r\nWest. Now, under these circumstances, I am forced to the conclusion, in\r\na case in which the proof is so clear and the facts are so flagrant, it\r\nis the duty of the court to fix a penalty which shall in some degree be\r\ncommensurate with the gravity of the offense. As between the two\r\ndefendants, in my opinion, the principal penalty should be imposed on\r\nthe corporation. The traffic manager in this case, presumably, acted\r\nwithout any advantage to himself and without any interest in the\r\ntransaction, either by the direct authority or in accordance with what\r\nhe understood to be the policy or the wishes of his employer.\r\n\r\n\"The sentence of this court in this case is, that the defendant\r\nPomeroy, for each of the six offenses upon which he has been convicted,\r\nbe fined the sum of $1,000, making six fines, amounting in all to the\r\nsum of $6,000; and the defendant, The New York Central and Hudson River\r\nRailroad Company, for each of the six crimes of which it has been\r\nconvicted, be fined the sum of $18,000, making six fines amounting in\r\nthe aggregate to the sum of $108,000, and judgment to that effect will\r\nbe entered in this case.\"\r\n\r\nIn connection with this matter, I would like to call attention to the\r\nvery unsatisfactory state of our criminal law, resulting in large part\r\nfrom the habit of setting aside the judgments of inferior courts on\r\ntechnicalities absolutely unconnected with the merits of the case, and\r\nwhere there is no attempt to show that there has been any failure of\r\nsubstantial justice. It would be well to enact a law providing\r\nsomething to the effect that:\r\n\r\nNo judgment shall be set aside or new trial granted in any cause, civil\r\nor criminal, on the ground of misdirection of the jury or the improper\r\nadmission or rejection of evidence, or for error as to any matter of\r\npleading or procedure unless, in the opinion of the court to which the\r\napplication is made, after an examination of the entire cause, it shall\r\naffirmatively appear that the error complained of has resulted in a\r\nmiscarriage of justice.\r\n\r\nIn my last message I suggested the enactment of a law in connection\r\nwith the issuance of injunctions, attention having been sharply drawn\r\nto the matter by the demand that the right of applying injunctions in\r\nlabor cases should be wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful whether\r\na law abolishing altogether the use of injunctions in such cases would\r\nstand the test of the courts; in which case of course the legislation\r\nwould be ineffective. Moreover, I believe it would be wrong altogether\r\nto prohibit the use of injunctions. It is criminal to permit sympathy\r\nfor criminals to weaken our hands in upholding the law; and if men seek\r\nto destroy life or property by mob violence there should be no\r\nimpairment of the power of the courts to deal with them in the most\r\nsummary and effective way possible. But so far as possible the abuse of\r\nthe power should be provided against by some such law as I advocated\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\nIn this matter of injunctions there is lodged in the hands of the\r\njudiciary a necessary power which is nevertheless subject to the\r\npossibility of grave abuse. It is a power that should be exercised with\r\nextreme care and should be subject to the jealous scrutiny of all men,\r\nand condemnation should be meted out as much to the judge who fails to\r\nuse it boldly when necessary as to the judge who uses it wantonly or\r\noppressively. Of course a judge strong enough to be fit for his office\r\nwill enjoin any resort to violence or intimidation, especially by\r\nconspiracy, no matter what his opinion may be of the rights of the\r\noriginal quarrel. There must be no hesitation in dealing with disorder.\r\nBut there must likewise be no such abuse of the injunctive power as is\r\nimplied in forbidding laboring men to strive for their own betterment\r\nin peaceful and lawful ways; nor must the injunction be used merely to\r\naid some big corporation in carrying out schemes for its own\r\naggrandizement. It must be remembered that a preliminary injunction in\r\na labor case, if granted without adequate proof (even when authority\r\ncan be found to support the conclusions of law on which it is founded),\r\nmay often settle the dispute between the parties; and therefore if\r\nimproperly granted may do irreparable wrong. Yet there are many judges\r\nwho assume a matter-of-course granting of a preliminary injunction to\r\nbe the ordinary and proper judicial disposition of such cases; and\r\nthere have undoubtedly been flagrant wrongs committed by judges in\r\nconnection with labor disputes even within the last few years, although\r\nI think much less often than in former years. Such judges by their\r\nunwise action immensely strengthen the hands of those who are striving\r\nentirely to do away with the power of injunction; and therefore such\r\ncareless use of the injunctive process tends to threaten its very\r\nexistence, for if the American people ever become convinced that this\r\nprocess is habitually abused, whether in matters affecting labor or in\r\nmatters affecting corporations, it will be well-nigh impossible to\r\nprevent its abolition.\r\n\r\nIt may be the highest duty of a judge at any given moment to disregard,\r\nnot merely the wishes of individuals of great political or financial\r\npower, but the overwhelming tide of public sentiment; and the judge who\r\ndoes thus disregard public sentiment when it is wrong, who brushes\r\naside the plea of any special interest when the pleading is not rounded\r\non righteousness, performs the highest service to the country. Such a\r\njudge is deserving of all honor; and all honor can not be paid to this\r\nwise and fearless judge if we permit the growth of an absurd convention\r\nwhich would forbid any criticism of the judge of another type, who\r\nshows himself timid in the presence of arrogant disorder, or who on\r\ninsufficient grounds grants an injunction that does grave injustice, or\r\nwho in his capacity as a construer, and therefore in part a maker, of\r\nthe law, in flagrant fashion thwarts the cause of decent government.\r\nThe judge has a power over which no review can be exercised; he himself\r\nsits in review upon the acts of both the executive and legislative\r\nbranches of the Government; save in the most extraordinary cases he is\r\namenable only at the bar of public opinion; and it is unwise to\r\nmaintain that public opinion in reference to a man with such power\r\nshall neither be exprest nor led.\r\n\r\nThe best judges have ever been foremost to disclaim any immunity from\r\ncriticism. This has been true since the days of the great English Lord\r\nChancellor Parker, who said: \"Let all people be at liberty to know what\r\nI found my judgment upon; that, so when I have given it in any cause,\r\nothers may be at liberty to judge of me.\" The proprieties of the case\r\nwere set forth with singular clearness and good temper by Judge W. H.\r\nTaft, when a United States circuit judge, eleven years ago, in 1895:\r\n\r\n\"The opportunity freely and publicly to criticize judicial action is of\r\nvastly more importance to the body politic than the immunity of courts\r\nand judges from unjust aspersions and attack. Nothing tends more to\r\nrender judges careful in their decisions and anxiously solicitous to do\r\nexact justice than the consciousness that every act of theirs is to be\r\nsubjected to the intelligent scrutiny and candid criticism of their\r\nfellow-men. Such criticism is beneficial in proportion as it is fair,\r\ndispassionate, discriminating, and based on a knowledge of sound legal\r\nprinciples. The comments made by learned text writers and by the acute\r\neditors of the various law reviews upon judicial decisions are\r\ntherefore highly useful. Such critics constitute more or less impartial\r\ntribunals of professional opinion before which each judgment is made to\r\nstand or fall on its merits, and thus exert a strong influence to\r\nsecure uniformity of decision. But non-professional criticism also is\r\nby no means without its uses, even if accompanied, as it often is, by a\r\ndirect attack upon the judicial fairness and motives of the occupants\r\nof the bench; for if the law is but the essence of common sense, the\r\nprotest of many average men may evidence a defect in a judicial\r\nconclusion, though based on the nicest legal reasoning and profoundest\r\nlearning. The two important elements of moral character in a judge are\r\nan earnest desire to reach a just conclusion and courage to enforce it.\r\nIn so far as fear of public comment does not affect the courage of a\r\njudge, but only spurs him on to search his conscience and to reach the\r\nresult which approves itself to his inmost heart such comment serves a\r\nuseful purpose. There are few men, whether they are judges for life or\r\nfor a shorter term, who do not prefer to earn and hold the respect of\r\nall, and who can not be reached and made to pause and deliberate by\r\nhostile public criticism. In the case of judges having a life tenure,\r\nindeed their very independence makes the right freely to comment on\r\ntheir decisions of greater importance, because it is the only practical\r\nand available instrument in the hands of a free people to keep such\r\njudges alive to the reasonable demands of those they serve.\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, the danger of destroying the proper influence of\r\njudicial decisions by creating unfounded prejudices against the courts\r\njustifies and requires that unjust attacks shall be met and answered.\r\nCourts must ultimately rest their defense upon the inherent strength of\r\nthe opinions they deliver as the ground for their conclusions and must\r\ntrust to the calm and deliberate judgment of all the people as their\r\nbest vindication.\"\r\n\r\nThere is one consideration which should be taken into account by the\r\ngood people who carry a sound proposition to an excess in objecting to\r\nany criticism of a judge's decision. The instinct of the American\r\npeople as a whole is sound in this matter. They will not subscribe to\r\nthe doctrine that any public servant is to be above all criticism. If\r\nthe best citizens, those most competent to express their judgment in\r\nsuch matters, and above all those belonging to the great and honorable\r\nprofession of the bar, so profoundly influential in American life, take\r\nthe position that there shall be no criticism of a judge under any\r\ncircumstances, their view will not be accepted by the American people\r\nas a whole. In such event the people will turn to, and tend to accept\r\nas justifiable, the intemperate and improper criticism uttered by\r\nunworthy agitators. Surely it is a misfortune to leave to such critics\r\na function, right, in itself, which they are certain to abuse. Just and\r\ntemperate criticism, when necessary, is a safeguard against the\r\nacceptance by the people as a whole of that intemperate antagonism\r\ntowards the judiciary which must be combated by every right-thinking\r\nman, and which, if it became widespread among the people at large,\r\nwould constitute a dire menace to the Republic.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the delays of the law, I call your attention and the\r\nattention of the Nation to the prevalence of crime among us, and above\r\nall to the epidemic of lynching and mob violence that springs up, now\r\nin one part of our country, now in another. Each section, North, South,\r\nEast, or West, has its own faults; no section can with wisdom spend its\r\ntime jeering at the faults of another section; it should be busy trying\r\nto amend its own shortcomings. To deal with the crime of corruption It\r\nis necessary to have an awakened public conscience, and to supplement\r\nthis by whatever legislation will add speed and certainty in the\r\nexecution of the law. When we deal with lynching even mote is\r\nnecessary. A great many white men are lynched, but the crime is\r\npeculiarly frequent in respect to black men. The greatest existing\r\ncause of lynching is the perpetration, especially by black men, of the\r\nhideous crime of rape--the most abominable in all the category of\r\ncrimes, even worse than murder. Mobs frequently avenge the commission\r\nof this crime by themselves torturing to death the man committing it;\r\nthus avenging in bestial fashion a bestial deed, and reducing\r\nthemselves to a level with the criminal.\r\n\r\nLawlessness grows by what it feeds upon; and when mobs begin to lynch\r\nfor rape they speedily extend the sphere of their operations and lynch\r\nfor many other kinds of crimes, so that two-thirds of the lynchings are\r\nnot for rape at all; while a considerable proportion of the individuals\r\nlynched are innocent of all crime. Governor Candler, of Georgia, stated\r\non one occasion some years ago: \"I can say of a verity that I have,\r\nwithin the last month, saved the lives of half a dozen innocent Negroes\r\nwho were pursued by the mob, and brought them to trial in a court of\r\nlaw in which they were acquitted.\" As Bishop Galloway, of Mississippi,\r\nhas finely said: \"When the rule of a mob obtains, that which\r\ndistinguishes a high civilization is surrendered. The mob which lynches\r\na negro charged with rape will in a little while lynch a white man\r\nsuspected of crime. Every Christian patriot in America needs to lift up\r\nhis voice in loud and eternal protest against the mob spirit that is\r\nthreatening the integrity of this Republic.\" Governor Jelks, of\r\nAlabama, has recently spoken as follows: \"The lynching of any person\r\nfor whatever crime is inexcusable anywhere--it is a defiance of orderly\r\ngovernment; but the killing of innocent people under any provocation is\r\ninfinitely more horrible; and yet innocent people are likely to die\r\nwhen a mob's terrible lust is once aroused. The lesson is this: No good\r\ncitizen can afford to countenance a defiance of the statutes, no matter\r\nwhat the provocation. The innocent frequently suffer, and, it is my\r\nobservation, more usually suffer than the guilty. The white people of\r\nthe South indict the whole colored race on the ground that even the\r\nbetter elements lend no assistance whatever in ferreting out criminals\r\nof their own color. The respectable colored people must learn not to\r\nharbor their criminals, but to assist the officers in bringing them to\r\njustice. This is the larger crime, and it provokes such atrocious\r\noffenses as the one at Atlanta. The two races can never get on until\r\nthere is an understanding on the part of both to make common cause with\r\nthe law-abiding against criminals of any color.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, where any crime committed by a member of one race against a\r\nmember of another race is avenged in such fashion that it seems as if\r\nnot the individual criminal, but the whole race, is attacked, the\r\nresult is to exasperate to the highest degree race feeling. There is\r\nbut one safe rule in dealing with black men as with white men; it is\r\nthe same rule that must be applied in dealing with rich men and poor\r\nmen; that is, to treat each man, whatever his color, his creed, or his\r\nsocial position, with even-handed justice on his real worth as a man.\r\nWhite people owe it quite as much to themselves as to the colored race\r\nto treat well the colored man who shows by his life that he deserves\r\nsuch treatment; for it is surely the highest wisdom to encourage in the\r\ncolored race all those individuals who are honest, industrious,\r\nlaw-abiding, and who therefore make good and safe neighbors and\r\ncitizens. Reward or punish the individual on his merits as an\r\nindividual. Evil will surely come in the end to both races if we\r\nsubstitute for this just rule the habit of treating all the members of\r\nthe race, good and bad, alike. There is no question of \"social\r\nequality\" or \"negro domination\" involved; only the question of\r\nrelentlessly punishing bad men, and of securing to the good man the\r\nright to his life, his liberty, and the pursuit of his happiness as his\r\nown qualities of heart, head, and hand enable him to achieve it.\r\n\r\nEvery colored man should realize that the worst enemy of his race is\r\nthe negro criminal, and above all the negro criminal who commits the\r\ndreadful crime of rape; and it should be felt as in the highest degree\r\nan offense against the whole country, and against the colored race in\r\nparticular, for a colored man to fail to help the officers of the law\r\nin hunting down with all possible earnestness and zeal every such\r\ninfamous offender. Moreover, in my judgment, the crime of rape should\r\nalways be punished with death, as is the case with murder; assault with\r\nintent to commit rape should be made a capital crime, at least in the\r\ndiscretion of the court; and provision should be made by which the\r\npunishment may follow immediately upon the heels of the offense; while\r\nthe trial should be so conducted that the victim need not be wantonly\r\nshamed while giving testimony, and that the least possible publicity\r\nshall be given to the details.\r\n\r\nThe members of the white race on the other hand should understand that\r\nevery lynching represents by just so much a loosening of the bands of\r\ncivilization; that the spirit of lynching inevitably throws into\r\nprominence in the community all the foul and evil creatures who dwell\r\ntherein. No man can take part in the torture of a human being without\r\nhaving his own moral nature permanently lowered. Every lynching means\r\njust so much moral deterioration in all the children who have any\r\nknowledge of it, and therefore just so much additional trouble for the\r\nnext generation of Americans.\r\n\r\nLet justice be both sure and swift; but let it be justice under the\r\nlaw, and not the wild and crooked savagery of a mob.\r\n\r\nThere is another matter which has a direct bearing upon this matter of\r\nlynching and of the brutal crime which sometimes calls it forth and at\r\nother times merely furnishes the excuse for its existence. It is out of\r\nthe question for our people as a whole permanently to rise by treading\r\ndown any of their own number. Even those who themselves for the moment\r\nprofit by such maltreatment of their fellows will in the long run also\r\nsuffer. No more shortsighted policy can be imagined than, in the\r\nfancied interest of one class, to prevent the education of another\r\nclass. The free public school, the chance for each boy or girl to get a\r\ngood elementary education, lies at the foundation of our whole\r\npolitical situation. In every community the poorest citizens, those who\r\nneed the schools most, would be deprived of them if they only received\r\nschool facilities proportioned to the taxes they paid. This is as true\r\nof one portion of our country as of another. It is as true for the\r\nnegro as for the white man. The white man, if he is wise, will decline\r\nto allow the Negroes in a mass to grow to manhood and womanhood without\r\neducation. Unquestionably education such as is obtained in our public\r\nschools does not do everything towards making a man a good citizen; but\r\nit does much. The lowest and most brutal criminals, those for instance\r\nwho commit the crime of rape, are in the great majority men who have\r\nhad either no education or very little; just as they are almost\r\ninvariably men who own no property; for the man who puts money by out\r\nof his earnings, like the man who acquires education, is usually lifted\r\nabove mere brutal criminality. Of course the best type of education for\r\nthe colored man, taken as a whole, is such education as is conferred in\r\nschools like Hampton and Tuskegee; where the boys and girls, the young\r\nmen and young women, are trained industrially as well as in the\r\nordinary public school branches. The graduates of these schools turn\r\nout well in the great majority of cases, and hardly any of them become\r\ncriminals, while what little criminality there is never takes the form\r\nof that brutal violence which invites lynch law. Every graduate of\r\nthese schools--and for the matter of that every other colored man or\r\nwoman--who leads a life so useful and honorable as to win the good will\r\nand respect of those whites whose neighbor he or she is, thereby helps\r\nthe whole colored race as it can be helped in no other way; for next to\r\nthe negro himself, the man who can do most to help the negro is his\r\nwhite neighbor who lives near him; and our steady effort should be to\r\nbetter the relations between the two. Great though the benefit of these\r\nschools has been to their colored pupils and to the colored people, it\r\nmay well be questioned whether the benefit, has not been at least as\r\ngreat to the white people among whom these colored pupils live after\r\nthey graduate.\r\n\r\nBe it remembered, furthermore, that the individuals who, whether from\r\nfolly, from evil temper, from greed for office, or in a spirit of mere\r\nbase demagogy, indulge in the inflammatory and incendiary speeches and\r\nwritings which tend to arouse mobs and to bring about lynching, not\r\nonly thus excite the mob, but also tend by what criminologists call\r\n\"suggestion,\" greatly to increase the likelihood of a repetition of the\r\nvery crime against which they are inveighing. When the mob is composed\r\nof the people of one race and the man lynched is of another race, the\r\nmen who in their speeches and writings either excite or justify the\r\naction tend, of course, to excite a bitter race feeling and to cause\r\nthe people of the opposite race to lose sight of the abominable act of\r\nthe criminal himself; and in addition, by the prominence they give to\r\nthe hideous deed they undoubtedly tend to excite in other brutal and\r\ndepraved natures thoughts of committing it. Swift, relentless, and\r\norderly punishment under the law is the only way by which criminality\r\nof this type can permanently be supprest.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with both labor and capital, with the questions affecting\r\nboth corporations and trades unions, there is one matter more important\r\nto remember than aught else, and that is the infinite harm done by\r\npreachers of mere discontent. These are the men who seek to excite a\r\nviolent class hatred against all men of wealth. They seek to turn wise\r\nand proper movements for the better control of corporations and for\r\ndoing away with the abuses connected with wealth, into a campaign of\r\nhysterical excitement and falsehood in which the aim is to inflame to\r\nmadness the brutal passions of mankind. The sinister demagogs and\r\nfoolish visionaries who are always eager to undertake such a campaign\r\nof destruction sometimes seek to associate themselves with those\r\nworking for a genuine reform in governmental and social methods, and\r\nsometimes masquerade as such reformers. In reality they are the worst\r\nenemies of the cause they profess to advocate, just as the purveyors of\r\nsensational slander in newspaper or magazine are the worst enemies of\r\nall men who are engaged in an honest effort to better what is bad in\r\nour social and governmental conditions. To preach hatred of the rich\r\nman as such, to carry on a campaign of slander and invective against\r\nhim, to seek to mislead and inflame to madness honest men whose lives\r\nare hard and who have not the kind of mental training which will permit\r\nthem to appreciate the danger in the doctrines preached--all this is to\r\ncommit a crime against the body politic and to be false to every worthy\r\nprinciple and tradition of American national life. Moreover, while such\r\npreaching and such agitation may give a livelihood and a certain\r\nnotoriety to some of those who take part in it, and may result in the\r\ntemporary political success of others, in the long run every such\r\nmovement will either fail or else will provoke a violent reaction,\r\nwhich will itself result not merely in undoing the mischief wrought by\r\nthe demagog and the agitator, but also in undoing the good that the\r\nhonest reformer, the true upholder of popular rights, has painfully and\r\nlaboriously achieved. Corruption is never so rife as in communities\r\nwhere the demagog and the agitator bear full sway, because in such\r\ncommunities all moral bands become loosened, and hysteria and\r\nsensationalism replace the spirit of sound judgment and fair dealing as\r\nbetween man and man. In sheer revolt against the squalid anarchy thus\r\nproduced men are sure in the end to turn toward any leader who can\r\nrestore order, and then their relief at being free from the intolerable\r\nburdens of class hatred, violence, and demagogy is such that they can\r\nnot for some time be aroused to indignation against misdeeds by men of\r\nwealth; so that they permit a new growth of the very abuses which were\r\nin part responsible for the original outbreak. The one hope for success\r\nfor our people lies in a resolute and fearless, but sane and\r\ncool-headed, advance along the path marked out last year by this very\r\nCongress. There must be a stern refusal to be misled into following\r\neither that base creature who appeals and panders to the lowest\r\ninstincts and passions in order to arouse one set of Americans against\r\ntheir fellows, or that other creature, equally base but no baser, who\r\nin a spirit of greed, or to accumulate or add to an already huge\r\nfortune, seeks to exploit his fellow Americans with callous disregard\r\nto their welfare of soul and body. The man who debauches others in\r\norder to obtain a high office stands on an evil equality of corruption\r\nwith the man who debauches others for financial profit; and when hatred\r\nis sown the crop which springs up can only be evil.\r\n\r\nThe plain people who think--the mechanics, farmers, merchants, workers\r\nwith head or hand, the men to whom American traditions are dear, who\r\nlove their country and try to act decently by their neighbors, owe it\r\nto themselves to remember that the most damaging blow that can be given\r\npopular government is to elect an unworthy and sinister agitator on a\r\nplatform of violence and hypocrisy. Whenever such an issue is raised in\r\nthis country nothing can be gained by flinching from it, for in such\r\ncase democracy is itself on trial, popular self-government under\r\nrepublican forms is itself on trial. The triumph of the mob is just as\r\nevil a thing as the triumph of the plutocracy, and to have escaped one\r\ndanger avails nothing whatever if we succumb to the other. In the end\r\nthe honest man, whether rich or poor, who earns his own living and\r\ntries to deal justly by his fellows, has as much to fear from the\r\ninsincere and unworthy demagog, promising much and performing nothing,\r\nor else performing nothing but evil, who would set on the mob to\r\nplunder the rich, as from the crafty corruptionist, who, for his own\r\nends, would permit the common people to be exploited by the very\r\nwealthy. If we ever let this Government fall into the hands of men of\r\neither of these two classes, we shall show ourselves false to America's\r\npast. Moreover, the demagog and the corruptionist often work hand in\r\nhand. There are at this moment wealthy reactionaries of such obtuse\r\nmorality that they regard the public servant who prosecutes them when\r\nthey violate the law, or who seeks to make them bear their proper share\r\nof the public burdens, as being even more objectionable than the\r\nviolent agitator who hounds on the mob to plunder the rich. There is\r\nnothing to choose between such a reactionary and such an agitator;\r\nfundamentally they are alike in their selfish disregard of the rights\r\nof others; and it is natural that they should join in opposition to any\r\nmovement of which the aim is fearlessly to do exact and even justice to\r\nall.\r\n\r\nI call your attention to the need of passing the bill limiting the\r\nnumber of hours of employment of railroad employees. The measure is a\r\nvery moderate one and I can conceive of no serious objection to it.\r\nIndeed, so far as it is in our power, it should be our aim steadily to\r\nreduce the number of hours of labor, with as a goal the general\r\nintroduction of an eight-hour day. There are industries in which it is\r\nnot possible that the hours of labor should be reduced; just as there\r\nare communities not far enough advanced for such a movement to be for\r\ntheir good, or, if in the Tropics, so situated that there is no analogy\r\nbetween their needs and ours in this matter. On the Isthmus of Panama,\r\nfor instance, the conditions are in every way so different from what\r\nthey are here that an eight-hour day would be absurd; just as it is\r\nabsurd, so far as the Isthmus is concerned, where white labor can not\r\nbe employed, to bother as to whether the necessary work is done by\r\nalien black men or by alien yellow men. But the wageworkers of the\r\nUnited States are of so high a grade that alike from the merely\r\nindustrial standpoint and from the civic standpoint it should be our\r\nobject to do what we can in the direction of securing the general\r\nobservance of an eight-hour day. Until recently the eight-hour law on\r\nour Federal statute books has been very scantily observed. Now,\r\nhowever, largely through the instrumentality of the Bureau of Labor, it\r\nis being rigidly enforced, and I shall speedily be able to say whether\r\nor not there is need of further legislation in reference thereto; .for\r\nour purpose is to see it obeyed in spirit no less than in letter. Half\r\nholidays during summer should be established for Government employees;\r\nit is as desirable for wageworkers who toil with their hands as for\r\nsalaried officials whose labor is mental that there should be a\r\nreasonable amount of holiday.\r\n\r\nThe Congress at its last session wisely provided for a truant court for\r\nthe District of Columbia; a marked step in advance on the path of\r\nproperly caring for the children. Let me again urge that the Congress\r\nprovide for a thorough investigation of the conditions of child labor\r\nand of the labor of women in the United States. More and more our\r\npeople are growing to recognize the fact that the questions which are\r\nnot merely of industrial but of social importance outweigh all others;\r\nand these two questions most emphatically come in the category of those\r\nwhich affect in the most far-reaching way the home life of the Nation.\r\nThe horrors incident to the employment of young children in factories\r\nor at work anywhere are a blot on our civilization. It is true that\r\neach. State must ultimately settle the question in its own way; but a\r\nthorough official investigation of the matter, with the results\r\npublished broadcast, would greatly help toward arousing the public\r\nconscience and securing unity of State action in the matter. There is,\r\nhowever, one law on the subject which should be enacted immediately,\r\nbecause there is no need for an investigation in reference thereto, and\r\nthe failure to enact it is discreditable to the National Government. A\r\ndrastic and thoroughgoing child-labor law should be enacted for the\r\nDistrict of Columbia and the Territories.\r\n\r\nAmong the excellent laws which the Congress past at the last session\r\nwas an employers' liability law. It was a marked step in advance to get\r\nthe recognition of employers' liability on the statute books; but the\r\nlaw did not go far enough. In spite of all precautions exercised by\r\nemployers there are unavoidable accidents and even deaths involved in\r\nnearly every line of business connected with the mechanic arts. This\r\ninevitable sacrifice of life may be reduced to a minimum, but it can\r\nnot be completely eliminated. It is a great social injustice to compel\r\nthe employee, or rather the family of the killed or disabled victim, to\r\nbear the entire burden of such an inevitable sacrifice. In other words,\r\nsociety shirks its duty by laying the whole cost on the victim, whereas\r\nthe injury comes from what may be called the legitimate risks of the\r\ntrade. Compensation for accidents or deaths due in any line of industry\r\nto the actual conditions under which that industry is carried on,\r\nshould be paid by that portion of the community for the benefit of\r\nwhich the industry is carried on--that is, by those who profit by the\r\nindustry. If the entire trade risk is placed upon the employer he will\r\npromptly and properly add it to the legitimate cost of production and\r\nassess it proportionately upon the consumers of his commodity. It is\r\ntherefore clear to my mind that the law should place this entire \"risk\r\nof a trade\" upon the employer. Neither the Federal law, nor, as far as\r\nI am informed, the State laws dealing with the question of employers'\r\nliability are sufficiently thoroughgoing. The Federal law should of\r\ncourse include employees in navy-yards, arsenals, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe commission appointed by the President October 16, 1902, at the\r\nrequest of both the anthracite coal operators and miners, to inquire\r\ninto, consider, and pass upon the questions in controversy in\r\nconnection with the strike in the anthracite regions of Pennsylvania\r\nand the causes out of which the controversy arose, in their report,\r\nfindings, and award exprest the belief \"that the State and Federal\r\ngovernments should provide the machinery for what may be called the\r\ncompulsory investigation of controversies between employers and\r\nemployees when they arise.\" This expression of belief is deserving of\r\nthe favorable consideration of the Congress and the enactment of its\r\nprovisions into law. A bill has already been introduced to this end.\r\n\r\nRecords show that during the twenty years from January 1, 1881, to,\r\nDecember 31, 1900, there were strikes affecting 117,509 establishments,\r\nand 6,105,694 employees were thrown out of employment. During the same\r\nperiod there were 1,005 lockouts, involving nearly 10,000\r\nestablishments, throwing over one million people out of employment.\r\nThese strikes and lockouts involved an estimated loss to employees of\r\n$307,000,000 and to employers of $143,000,000, a total of $450,000,000.\r\nThe public suffered directly and indirectly probably as great\r\nadditional loss. But the money loss, great as it was, did not measure\r\nthe anguish and suffering endured by the wives and children of\r\nemployees whose pay stopt when their work stopt, or the disastrous\r\neffect of the strike or lockout upon the business of employers, or the\r\nincrease in the cost of products and the inconvenience and loss to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nMany of these strikes and lockouts would not have occurred had the\r\nparties to the dispute been required to appear before an unprejudiced\r\nbody representing the nation and, face to face, state the reasons for\r\ntheir contention. In most instances the dispute would doubtless be\r\nfound to be due to a misunderstanding by each of the other's rights,\r\naggravated by an unwillingness of either party to accept as true the\r\nstatements of the other as to the justice or injustice of the matters\r\nin dispute. The exercise of a judicial spirit by a disinterested body\r\nrepresenting the Federal Government, such as would be provided by a\r\ncommission on conciliation and arbitration, would tend to create an\r\natmosphere of friendliness and conciliation between contending parties;\r\nand the giving each side an equal opportunity to present fully its case\r\nin the presence of the other would prevent many disputes from\r\ndeveloping into serious strikes or lockouts, and, in other cases, would\r\nenable the commission to persuade the opposing parties to come to\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nIn this age of great corporate and labor combinations, neither\r\nemployers nor employees should be left completely at the mercy of the\r\nstronger party to a dispute, regardless of the righteousness of their\r\nrespective claims. The proposed measure would be in the line of\r\nsecuring recognition of the fact that in many strikes the public has\r\nitself an interest which can not wisely be disregarded; an interest not\r\nmerely of general convenience, for the question of a just and proper\r\npublic policy must also be considered. In all legislation of this kind\r\nit is well to advance cautiously, testing each step by the actual\r\nresults; the step proposed can surely be safely taken, for the\r\ndecisions of the commission would not bind the parties in legal\r\nfashion, and yet would give a chance for public opinion to crystallize\r\nand thus to exert its full force for the right.\r\n\r\nIt is not wise that the Nation should alienate its remaining coal\r\nlands. I have temporarily withdrawn from settlement all the lands which\r\nthe Geological Survey has indicated as containing, or in all\r\nprobability containing, coal. The question, however, can be properly\r\nsettled only by legislation, which in my judgment should provide for\r\nthe withdrawal of these lands from sale or from entry, save in certain\r\nespecial circumstances. The ownership would then remain in the United\r\nStates, which should not, however, attempt to work them, but permit\r\nthem to be worked by private individuals under a royalty system, the\r\nGovernment keeping such control as to permit it to see that no\r\nexcessive price was charged consumers. It would, of course, be as\r\nnecessary to supervise the rates charged by the common carriers to\r\ntransport the product as the rates charged by those who mine it; and\r\nthe supervision must extend to the conduct of the common carriers, so\r\nthat they shall in no way favor one competitor at the expense of\r\nanother. The withdrawal of these coal lands would constitute a policy\r\nanalogous to that which has been followed in withdrawing the forest\r\nlands from ordinary settlement. The coal, like the forests, should be\r\ntreated as the property of the public and its disposal should be under\r\nconditions which would inure to the benefit of the public as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe present Congress has taken long strides in the direction of\r\nsecuring proper supervision and control by the National Government over\r\ncorporations engaged in interstate business and the enormous majority\r\nof corporations of any size are engaged in interstate business. The\r\npassage of the railway rate bill, and only to a less degree the passage\r\nof the pure food bill, and the provision for increasing and rendering\r\nmore effective national control over the beef-packing industry, mark an\r\nimportant advance in the proper direction. In the short session it will\r\nperhaps be difficult to do much further along this line; and it may be\r\nbest to wait until the laws have been in operation for a number of\r\nmonths before endeavoring to increase their scope, because only\r\noperation will show with exactness their merits and their shortcomings\r\nand thus give opportunity to define what further remedial legislation\r\nis needed. Yet in my judgment it will in the end be advisable in\r\nconnection with the packing house inspection law to provide for putting\r\na date on the label and for charging the cost of inspection to the\r\npackers. All these laws have already justified their enactment. The\r\ninterstate commerce law, for instance, has rather amusingly falsified\r\nthe predictions, both of those who asserted that it would ruin the\r\nrailroads and of those who asserted that it did not go far enough and\r\nwould accomplish nothing. During the last five months the railroads\r\nhave shown increased earnings and some of them unusual dividends; while\r\nduring the same period the mere taking effect of the law has produced\r\nan unprecedented, a hitherto unheard of, number of voluntary reductions\r\nin freights and fares by the railroads. Since the founding of the\r\nCommission there has never been a time of equal length in which\r\nanything like so many reduced tariffs have been put into effect. On\r\nAugust 27, for instance, two days before the new law went into effect,\r\nthe Commission received notices of over five thousand separate tariffs\r\nwhich represented reductions from previous rates.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that with the passage of these laws\r\nit will be possible to stop progress along the line of increasing the\r\npower of the National Government over the use of capital interstate\r\ncommerce. For example, there will ultimately be need of enlarging the\r\npowers of the Interstate Commerce Commission along several different\r\nlines, so as to give it a larger and more efficient control over the\r\nrailroads.\r\n\r\nIt can not too often be repeated that experience has conclusively shown\r\nthe impossibility of securing by the actions of nearly half a hundred\r\ndifferent State legislatures anything but ineffective chaos in the way\r\nof dealing with the great corporations which do not operate exclusively\r\nwithin the limits of any one State. In some method, whether by a\r\nnational license law or in other fashion, we must exercise, and that at\r\nan early date, a far more complete control than at present over these\r\ngreat corporations--a control that will among other things prevent the\r\nevils of excessive overcapitalization, and that will compel the\r\ndisclosure by each big corporation of its stockholders and of its\r\nproperties and business, whether owned directly or through subsidiary\r\nor affiliated corporations. This will tend to put a stop to the\r\nsecuring of inordinate profits by favored individuals at the expense\r\nwhether of the general public, the stockholders, or the wageworkers.\r\nOur effort should be not so much to prevent consolidation as such, but\r\nso to supervise and control it as to see that it results in no harm to\r\nthe people. The reactionary or ultraconservative apologists for the\r\nmisuse of wealth assail the effort to secure such control as a step\r\ntoward socialism. As a matter of fact it is these reactionaries and\r\nultraconservatives who are themselves most potent in increasing\r\nsocialistic feeling. One of the most efficient methods of averting the\r\nconsequences of a dangerous agitation, which is 80 per cent wrong, is\r\nto remedy the 20 per cent of evil as to which the agitation is well\r\nrounded. The best way to avert the very undesirable move for the\r\ngovernment ownership of railways is to secure by the Government on\r\nbehalf of the people as a whole such adequate control and regulation of\r\nthe great interstate common carriers as will do away with the evils\r\nwhich give rise to the agitation against them. So the proper antidote\r\nto the dangerous and wicked agitation against the men of wealth as such\r\nis to secure by proper legislation and executive action the abolition\r\nof the grave abuses which actually do obtain in connection with the\r\nbusiness use of wealth under our present system--or rather no\r\nsystem--of failure to exercise any adequate control at all. Some\r\npersons speak as if the exercise of such governmental control would do\r\naway with the freedom of individual initiative and dwarf individual\r\neffort. This is not a fact. It would be a veritable calamity to fail to\r\nput a premium upon individual initiative, individual capacity and\r\neffort; upon the energy, character, and foresight which it is so\r\nimportant to encourage in the individual. But as a matter of fact the\r\ndeadening and degrading effect of pure socialism, and especially of its\r\nextreme form communism, and the destruction of individual character\r\nwhich they would bring about, are in part achieved by the wholly\r\nunregulated competition which results in a single individual or\r\ncorporation rising at the expense of all others until his or its rise\r\neffectually checks all competition and reduces former competitors to a\r\nposition of utter inferiority and subordination.\r\n\r\nIn enacting and enforcing such legislation as this Congress already has\r\nto its credit, we are working on a coherent plan, with the steady\r\nendeavor to secure the needed reform by the joint action of the\r\nmoderate men, the plain men who do not wish anything hysterical or\r\ndangerous, but who do intend to deal in resolute common-sense fashion\r\nwith the real and great evils of the present system. The reactionaries\r\nand the violent extremists show symptoms of joining hands against us.\r\nBoth assert, for instance, that, if logical, we should go to government\r\nownership of railroads and the like; the reactionaries, because on such\r\nan issue they think the people would stand with them, while the\r\nextremists care rather to preach discontent and agitation than to\r\nachieve solid results. As a matter of fact, our position is as remote\r\nfrom that of the Bourbon reactionary as from that of the impracticable\r\nor sinister visionary. We hold that the Government should not conduct\r\nthe business of the nation, but that it should exercise such\r\nsupervision as will insure its being conducted in the interest of the\r\nnation. Our aim is, so far as may be, to secure, for all decent, hard\r\nworking men, equality of opportunity and equality of burden.\r\n\r\nThe actual working of our laws has shown that the effort to prohibit\r\nall combination, good or bad, is noxious where it is not ineffective.\r\nCombination of capital like combination of labor is a necessary element\r\nof our present industrial system. It is not possible completely to\r\nprevent it; and if it were possible, such complete prevention would do\r\ndamage to the body politic. What we need is not vainly to try to\r\nprevent all combination, but to secure such rigorous and adequate\r\ncontrol and supervision of the combinations as to prevent their\r\ninjuring the public, or existing in such form as inevitably to threaten\r\ninjury--for the mere fact that a combination has secured practically\r\ncomplete control of a necessary of life would under any circumstances\r\nshow that such combination was to be presumed to be adverse to the\r\npublic interest. It is unfortunate that our present laws should forbid\r\nall combinations, instead of sharply discriminating between those\r\ncombinations which do good and those combinations which do evil.\r\nRebates, for instance, are as often due to the pressure of big shippers\r\n(as was shown in the investigation of the Standard Oil Company and as\r\nhas been shown since by the investigation of the tobacco and sugar\r\ntrusts) as to the initiative of big railroads. Often railroads would\r\nlike to combine for the purpose of preventing a big shipper from\r\nmaintaining improper advantages at the expense of small shippers and of\r\nthe general public. Such a combination, instead of being forbidden by\r\nlaw, should be favored. In other words, it should be permitted to\r\nrailroads to make agreements, provided these agreements were sanctioned\r\nby the Interstate Commerce Commission and were published. With these\r\ntwo conditions complied with it is impossible to see what harm such a\r\ncombination could do to the public at large. It is a public evil to\r\nhave on the statute books a law incapable of full enforcement because\r\nboth judges and juries realize that its full enforcement would destroy\r\nthe business of the country; for the result is to make decent railroad\r\nmen violators of the law against their will, and to put a premium on\r\nthe behavior of the wilful wrongdoers. Such a result in turn tends to\r\nthrow the decent man and the wilful wrongdoer into close association,\r\nand in the end to drag down the former to the latter's level; for the\r\nman who becomes a lawbreaker in one way unhappily tends to lose all\r\nrespect for law and to be willing to break it in many ways. No more\r\nscathing condemnation could be visited upon a law than is contained in\r\nthe words of the Interstate Commerce Commission when, in commenting\r\nupon the fact that the numerous joint traffic associations do\r\ntechnically violate the law, they say: \"The decision of the United\r\nStates Supreme Court in the Trans-Missouri case and the Joint Traffic\r\nAssociation case has produced no practical effect upon the railway\r\noperations of the country. Such associations, in fact, exist now as\r\nthey did before these decisions, and with the same general effect. In\r\njustice to all parties, we ought probably to add that it is difficult\r\nto see how our interstate railways could be operated with due regard to\r\nthe interest of the shipper and the railway without concerted action of\r\nthe kind afforded through these associations.\"\r\n\r\nThis means that the law as construed by the Supreme Court is such that\r\nthe business of the country can not be conducted without breaking it. I\r\nrecommend that you give careful and early consideration to this\r\nsubject, and if you find the opinion of the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission justified, that you amend the law so as to obviate the evil\r\ndisclosed.\r\n\r\nThe question of taxation is difficult in any country, but it is\r\nespecially difficult in ours with its Federal system of government.\r\nSome taxes should on every ground be levied in a small district for use\r\nin that district. Thus the taxation of real estate is peculiarly one\r\nfor the immediate locality in which the real estate is found. Again,\r\nthere is no more legitimate tax for any State than a tax on the\r\nfranchises conferred by that State upon street railroads and similar\r\ncorporations which operate wholly within the State boundaries,\r\nsometimes in one and sometimes in several municipalities or other minor\r\ndivisions of the State. But there are many kinds of taxes which can\r\nonly be levied by the General Government so as to produce the best\r\nresults, because, among other reasons, the attempt to impose them in\r\none particular State too often results merely in driving the\r\ncorporation or individual affected to some other locality or other\r\nState. The National Government has long derived its chief revenue from\r\na tariff on imports and from an internal or excise tax. In addition to\r\nthese there is every reason why, when next our system of taxation is\r\nrevised, the National Government should impose a graduated inheritance\r\ntax, and, if possible, a graduated income tax. The man of great wealth\r\nowes a peculiar obligation to the State, because he derives special\r\nadvantages from the mere existence of government. Not only should he\r\nrecognize this obligation in the way he leads his daily life and in the\r\nway he earns and spends his money, but it should also be recognized by\r\nthe way in which he pays for the protection the State gives him. On the\r\none hand, it is desirable that he should assume his full and proper\r\nshare of the burden of taxation; on the other hand, it is quite as\r\nnecessary that in this kind of taxation, where the men who vote the tax\r\npay but little of it, there should be clear recognition of the danger\r\nof inaugurating any such system save in a spirit of entire justice and\r\nmoderation. Whenever we, as a people, undertake to remodel our taxation\r\nsystem along the lines suggested, we must make it clear beyond\r\nperadventure that our aim is to distribute the burden of supporting the\r\nGovernment more equitably than at present; that we intend to treat rich\r\nman and poor man on a basis of absolute equality, and that we regard it\r\nas equally fatal to true democracy to do or permit injustice to the one\r\nas to do or permit injustice to the other.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that such a subject as this needs long and careful\r\nstudy in order that the people may become familiar with what is\r\nproposed to be done, may clearly see the necessity of proceeding with\r\nwisdom and self-restraint, and may make up their minds just how far\r\nthey are willing to go in the matter; while only trained legislators\r\ncan work out the project in necessary detail. But I feel that in the\r\nnear future our national legislators should enact a law providing for a\r\ngraduated inheritance tax by which a steadily increasing rate of duty\r\nshould be put upon all moneys or other valuables coming by gift,\r\nbequest, or devise to any individual or corporation. It may be well to\r\nmake the tax heavy in proportion as the individual benefited is remote\r\nof kin. In any event, in my judgment the pro rata of the tax should\r\nincrease very heavily with the increase of the amount left to any one\r\nindividual after a certain point has been reached. It is most desirable\r\nto encourage thrift and ambition, and a potent source of thrift and\r\nambition is the desire on the part of the breadwinner to leave his\r\nchildren well off. This object can be attained by making the tax very\r\nsmall on moderate amounts of property left; because the prime object\r\nshould be to put a constantly increasing burden on the inheritance of\r\nthose swollen fortunes which it is certainly of no benefit to this\r\ncountry to perpetuate.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question of the ethical propriety of the Government\r\nthus determining the conditions upon which any gift or inheritance\r\nshould be received. Exactly how far the inheritance tax would, as an\r\nincident, have the effect of limiting the transmission by devise or\r\ngift of the enormous fortunes in question it is not necessary at\r\npresent to discuss. It is wise that progress in this direction should\r\nbe gradual. At first a permanent national inheritance tax, while it\r\nmight be more substantial than any such tax has hitherto been, need not\r\napproximate, either in amount or in the extent of the increase by\r\ngraduation, to what such a tax should ultimately be.\r\n\r\nThis species of tax has again and again been imposed, although only\r\ntemporarily, by the National Government. It was first imposed by the\r\nact of July 6, 1797, when the makers of the Constitution were alive and\r\nat the head of affairs. It was a graduated tax; though small in amount,\r\nthe rate was increased with the amount left to any individual,\r\nexceptions being made in the case of certain close kin. A similar tax\r\nwas again imposed by the act of July 1, 1862; a minimum sum of one\r\nthousand dollars in personal property being excepted from taxation, the\r\ntax then becoming progressive according to the remoteness of kin. The\r\nwar-revenue act of June 13, 1898, provided for an inheritance tax on\r\nany sum exceeding the value of ten thousand dollars, the rate of the\r\ntax increasing both in accordance with the amounts left and in\r\naccordance with the legatee's remoteness of kin. The Supreme Court has\r\nheld that the succession tax imposed at the time of the Civil War was\r\nnot a direct tax but an impost or excise which was both constitutional\r\nand valid. More recently the Court, in an opinion delivered by Mr.\r\nJustice White, which contained an exceedingly able and elaborate\r\ndiscussion of the powers of the Congress to impose death duties,\r\nsustained the constitutionality of the inheritance-tax feature of the\r\nwar-revenue act of 1898.\r\n\r\nIn its incidents, and apart from the main purpose of raising revenue,\r\nan income tax stands on an entirely different footing from an\r\ninheritance tax; because it involves no question of the perpetuation of\r\nfortunes swollen to an unhealthy size. The question is in its essence a\r\nquestion of the proper adjustment of burdens to benefits. As the law\r\nnow stands it is undoubtedly difficult to devise a national income tax\r\nwhich shall be constitutional. But whether it is absolutely impossible\r\nis another question; and if possible it is most certainly desirable.\r\nThe first purely income-tax law was past by the Congress in 1861, but\r\nthe most important law dealing with the subject was that of 1894. This\r\nthe court held to be unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nThe question is undoubtedly very intricate, delicate, and troublesome.\r\nThe decision of the court was only reached by one majority. It is the\r\nlaw of the land, and of course is accepted as such and loyally obeyed\r\nby all good citizens. Nevertheless, the hesitation evidently felt by\r\nthe court as a whole in coming to a conclusion, when considered\r\ntogether with the previous decisions on the subject, may perhaps\r\nindicate the possibility of devising a constitutional income-tax law\r\nwhich shall substantially accomplish the results aimed at. The\r\ndifficulty of amending the Constitution is so great that only real\r\nnecessity can justify a resort thereto. Every effort should be made in\r\ndealing with this subject, as with the subject of the proper control by\r\nthe National Government over the use of corporate wealth in interstate\r\nbusiness, to devise legislation which without such action shall attain\r\nthe desired end; but if this fails, there will ultimately be no\r\nalternative to a constitutional amendment.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to overstate (though it is of course difficult\r\nquantitatively to measure) the effect upon a nation's growth to\r\ngreatness of what may be called organized patriotism, which necessarily\r\nincludes the substitution of a national feeling for mere local pride;\r\nwith as a resultant a high ambition for the whole country. No country\r\ncan develop its full strength so long as the parts which make up the\r\nwhole each put a feeling of loyalty to the part above the feeling of\r\nloyalty to the whole. This is true of sections and it is just as true\r\nof classes. The industrial and agricultural classes must work together,\r\ncapitalists and wageworkers must work together, if the best work of\r\nwhich the country is capable is to be done. It is probable that a\r\nthoroughly efficient system of education comes next to the influence of\r\npatriotism in bringing about national success of this kind. Our federal\r\nform of government, so fruitful of advantage to our people in certain\r\nways, in other ways undoubtedly limits our national effectiveness. It\r\nis not possible, for instance, for the National Government to take the\r\nlead in technical industrial education, to see that the public school\r\nsystem of this country develops on all its technical, industrial,\r\nscientific, and commercial sides. This must be left primarily to the\r\nseveral States. Nevertheless, the National Government has control of\r\nthe schools of the District of Columbia, and it should see that these\r\nschools promote and encourage the fullest development of the scholars\r\nin both commercial and industrial training. The commercial training\r\nshould in one of its branches deal with foreign trade. The industrial\r\ntraining is even more important. It should be one of our prime objects\r\nas a Nation, so far as feasible, constantly to work toward putting the\r\nmechanic, the wageworker who works with his hands, on a higher plane of\r\nefficiency and reward, so as to increase his effectiveness in the\r\neconomic world, and the dignity, the remuneration, and the power of his\r\nposition in the social world. Unfortunately, at present the effect of\r\nsome of the work in the public schools is in the exactly opposite\r\ndirection. If boys and girls are trained merely in literary\r\naccomplishments, to the total exclusion of industrial, manual, and\r\ntechnical training, the tendency is to unfit them for industrial work\r\nand to make them reluctant to go into it, or unfitted to do well if\r\nthey do go into it. This is a tendency which should be strenuously\r\ncombated. Our industrial development depends largely upon technical\r\neducation, including in this term all industrial education, from that\r\nwhich fits a man to be a good mechanic, a good carpenter, or\r\nblacksmith, to that which fits a man to do the greatest engineering\r\nfeat. The skilled mechanic, the skilled workman, can best become such\r\nby technical industrial education. The far-reaching usefulness of\r\ninstitutes of technology and schools of mines or of engineering is now\r\nuniversally acknowledged, and no less far--reaching is the effect of a\r\ngood building or mechanical trades school, a textile, or watch-making,\r\nor engraving school. All such training must develop not only manual\r\ndexterity but industrial intelligence. In international rivalry this\r\ncountry does not have to fear the competition of pauper labor as much\r\nas it has to fear the educated labor of specially trained competitors;\r\nand we should have the education of the hand, eye, and brain which will\r\nfit us to meet such competition.\r\n\r\nIn every possible way we should help the wageworker who toils with his\r\nhands and who must (we hope in a constantly increasing measure) also\r\ntoil with his brain. Under the Constitution the National Legislature\r\ncan do but little of direct importance for his welfare save where he is\r\nengaged in work which permits it to act under the interstate commerce\r\nclause of the Constitution; and this is one reason why I so earnestly\r\nhope that both the legislative and judicial branches of the Government\r\nwill construe this clause of the Constitution in the broadest possible\r\nmanner. We can, however, in such a matter as industrial training, in\r\nsuch a matter as child labor and factory laws, set an example to the\r\nStates by enacting the most advanced legislation that can wisely be\r\nenacted for the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe only other persons whose welfare is as vital to the welfare of the\r\nwhole country as is the welfare of the wageworkers are the tillers of\r\nthe soil, the farmers. It is a mere truism to say that no growth of\r\ncities, no growth of wealth, no industrial development can atone for\r\nany falling off in the character and standing of the farming\r\npopulation. During the last few decades this fact has been recognized\r\nwith ever-increasing clearness. There is no longer any failure to\r\nrealize that farming, at least in certain branches, must become a\r\ntechnical and scientific profession. This means that there must be open\r\nto farmers the chance for technical and scientific training, not\r\ntheoretical merely but of the most severely practical type. The farmer\r\nrepresents a peculiarly high type of American citizenship, and he must\r\nhave the same chance to rise and develop as other American citizens\r\nhave. Moreover, it is exactly as true of the farmer, as it is of the\r\nbusiness man and the wageworker, that the ultimate success of the\r\nNation of which he forms a part must be founded not alone on material\r\nprosperity but upon high moral, mental, and physical development. This\r\neducation of the farmer--self-education by preference but also\r\neducation from the outside, as with all other men--is peculiarly\r\nnecessary here in the United States, where the frontier conditions even\r\nin the newest States have now nearly vanished, where there must be a\r\nsubstitution of a more intensive system of cultivation for the old\r\nwasteful farm management, and where there must be a better business\r\norganization among the farmers themselves.\r\n\r\nSeveral factors must cooperate in the improvement of the farmer's\r\ncondition. He must have the chance to be educated in the widest\r\npossible sense--in the sense which keeps ever in view the intimate\r\nrelationship between the theory of education and the facts of life. In\r\nall education we should widen our aims. It is a good thing to produce a\r\ncertain number of trained scholars and students; but the education\r\nsuperintended by the State must seek rather to produce a hundred good\r\ncitizens than merely one scholar, and it must be turned now and then\r\nfrom the class book to the study of the great book of nature itself.\r\nThis is especially true of the farmer, as has been pointed out again\r\nand again by all observers most competent to pass practical judgment on\r\nthe problems of our country life. All students now realize that\r\neducation must seek to train the executive powers of young people and\r\nto confer more real significance upon the phrase \"dignity of labor,\"\r\nand to prepare the pupils so that, in addition to each developing in\r\nthe highest degree his individual capacity for work, they may together\r\nhelp create a right public opinion, and show in many ways social and\r\ncooperative spirit. Organization has become necessary in the business\r\nworld; and it has accomplished much for good in the world of labor. It\r\nis no less necessary for farmers. Such a movement as the grange\r\nmovement is good in itself and is capable of a well-nigh infinite\r\nfurther extension for good so long as it is kept to its own legitimate\r\nbusiness. The benefits to be derived by the association of farmers for\r\nmutual advantage are partly economic and partly sociological.\r\n\r\nMoreover, while in the long run voluntary efforts will prove more\r\nefficacious than government assistance, while the farmers must\r\nprimarily do most for themselves, yet the Government can also do much.\r\nThe Department of Agriculture has broken new ground in many directions,\r\nand year by year it finds how it can improve its methods and develop\r\nfresh usefulness. Its constant effort is to give the governmental\r\nassistance in the most effective way; that is, through associations of\r\nfarmers rather than to or through individual farmers. It is also\r\nstriving to coordinate its work with the agricultural departments of\r\nthe several States, and so far as its own work is educational to\r\ncoordinate it with the work of other educational authorities.\r\nAgricultural education is necessarily based upon general education, but\r\nour agricultural educational institutions are wisely specializing\r\nthemselves, making their courses relate to the actual teaching of the\r\nagricultural and kindred sciences to young country people or young city\r\npeople who wish to live in the country.\r\n\r\nGreat progress has already been made among farmers by the creation of\r\nfarmers' institutes, of dairy associations, of breeders' associations,\r\nhorticultural associations, and the like. A striking example of how the\r\nGovernment and the farmers can cooperate is shown in connection with\r\nthe menace offered to the cotton growers of the Southern States by the\r\nadvance of the boll weevil. The Department is doing all it can to\r\norganize the farmers in the threatened districts, just as it has been\r\ndoing all it can to organize them in aid of its work to eradicate the\r\ncattle fever tick in the South. The Department can and will cooperate\r\nwith all such associations, and it must have their help if its own work\r\nis to be done in the most efficient style.\r\n\r\nMuch is now being done for the States of the Rocky Mountains and Great\r\nPlains through the development of the national policy of irrigation and\r\nforest preservation; no Government policy for the betterment of our\r\ninternal conditions has been more fruitful of good than this. The\r\nforests of the White Mountains and Southern Appalachian regions should\r\nalso be preserved; and they can not be unless the people of the States\r\nin which they lie, through their representatives in the Congress,\r\nsecure vigorous action by the National Government.\r\n\r\nI invite the attention of the Congress to the estimate of the Secretary\r\nof War for an appropriation to enable him to begin the preliminary work\r\nfor the construction of a memorial amphitheater at Arlington. The Grand\r\nArmy of the Republic in its national encampment has urged the erection\r\nof such an amphitheater as necessary for the proper observance Of\r\nMemorial Day and as a fitting monument to the soldier and sailor dead\r\nburied there. In this I heartily concur and commend the matter to the\r\nfavorable consideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nI am well aware of how difficult it is to pass a constitutional\r\namendment. Nevertheless in my judgment the whole question of marriage\r\nand divorce should be relegated to the authority of the National\r\nCongress. At present the wide differences in the laws of the different\r\nStates on this subject result in scandals and abuses; and surely there\r\nis nothing so vitally essential to the welfare of the nation, nothing\r\naround which the nation should so bend itself to throw every safeguard,\r\nas the home life of the average citizen. The change would be good from\r\nevery standpoint. In particular it would be good because it would\r\nconfer on the Congress the power at once to deal radically and\r\nefficiently with polygamy; and this should be done whether or not\r\nmarriage and divorce are dealt with. It is neither safe nor proper to\r\nleave the question of polygamy to be dealt with by the several States.\r\nPower to deal with it should be conferred on the National Government.\r\n\r\nWhen home ties are loosened; when men and women cease to regard a\r\nworthy family life, with all its duties fully performed, and all its\r\nresponsibilities lived up to, as the life best worth living; then evil\r\ndays for the commonwealth are at hand. There are regions in our land,\r\nand classes of our population, where the birth rate has sunk below the\r\ndeath rate. Surely it should need no demonstration to show that wilful\r\nsterility is, from the standpoint of the nation, from the standpoint of\r\nthe human race, the one sin for which the penalty is national death,\r\nrace death; a sin for which there is no atonement; a sin which is the\r\nmore dreadful exactly in proportion as the men and women guilty thereof\r\nare in other respects, in character, and bodily and mental powers,\r\nthose whom for the sake of the state it would be well to see the\r\nfathers and mothers of many healthy children, well brought up in homes\r\nmade happy by their presence. No man, no woman, can shirk the primary\r\nduties of life, whether for love of ease and pleasure, or for any other\r\ncause, and retain his or her self-respect.\r\n\r\nLet me once again call the attention of the Congress to two subjects\r\nconcerning which I have frequently before communicated with them. One\r\nis the question of developing American shipping. I trust that a law\r\nembodying in substance the views, or a major part of the views, exprest\r\nin the report on this subject laid before the House at its last session\r\nwill be past. I am well aware that in former years objectionable\r\nmeasures have been proposed in reference to the encouragement of\r\nAmerican shipping; but it seems to me that the proposed measure is as\r\nnearly unobjectionable as any can be. It will of course benefit\r\nprimarily our seaboard States, such as Maine, Louisiana, and\r\nWashington; but what benefits part of our people in the end benefits\r\nall; just as Government aid to irrigation and forestry in the West is\r\nreally of benefit, not only to the Rocky Mountain States, but to all\r\nour country. If it prove impracticable to enact a law for the\r\nencouragement of shipping generally, then at least provision should be\r\nmade for better communication with South America, notably for fast mail\r\nlines to the chief South American ports. It is discreditable to us that\r\nour business people, for lack of direct communication in the shape of\r\nlines of steamers with South America, should in that great sister\r\ncontinent be at a disadvantage compared to the business people of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nI especially call your attention to the second subject, the condition\r\nof our currency laws. The national bank act has ably served a great\r\npurpose in aiding the enormous business development of the country; and\r\nwithin ten years there has been an increase in circulation per capita\r\nfrom $21.41 to $33.08. For several years evidence has been accumulating\r\nthat additional legislation is needed. The recurrence of each crop\r\nseason emphasizes the defects of the present laws. There must soon be a\r\nrevision of them, because to leave them as they are means to incur\r\nliability of business disaster. Since your body adjourned there has\r\nbeen a fluctuation in the interest on call money from 2 per cent to 30\r\nper cent; and the fluctuation was even greater during the preceding six\r\nmonths. The Secretary of the Treasury had to step in and by wise action\r\nput a stop to the most violent period of oscillation. Even worse than\r\nsuch fluctuation is the advance in commercial rates and the uncertainty\r\nfelt in the sufficiency of credit even at high rates. All commercial\r\ninterests suffer during each crop period. Excessive rates for call\r\nmoney in New York attract money from the interior banks into the\r\nspeculative field; this depletes the fund that would otherwise be\r\navailable for commercial uses, and commercial borrowers are forced to\r\npay abnormal rates; so that each fall a tax, in the shape of increased\r\ninterest charges, is placed on the whole commerce of the country.\r\n\r\nThe mere statement of these has shows that our present system is\r\nseriously defective. There is need of a change. Unfortunately, however,\r\nmany of the proposed changes must be ruled from consideration because\r\nthey are complicated, are not easy of comprehension, and tend to,\r\ndisturb existing rights and interests. We must also rule out any plan\r\nwhich would materially impair the value of the United States 2 per cent\r\nbonds now pledged to secure circulations, the issue of which was made\r\nunder conditions peculiarly creditable to the Treasury. I do not press\r\nany especial plan. Various plans have recently been proposed by expert\r\ncommittees of bankers. Among the plans which are possibly feasible and\r\nwhich certainly should receive your consideration is that repeatedly\r\nbrought to your attention by the present Secretary of the Treasury, the\r\nessential features of which have been approved by many prominent\r\nbankers and business men. According to this plan national banks should\r\nbe permitted to issue a specified proportion of their capital in notes\r\nof a given kind, the issue to be taxed at so high a rate as to drive\r\nthe notes back when not wanted in legitimate trade. This plan would not\r\npermit the issue of currency to give banks additional profits, but to\r\nmeet the emergency presented by times of stringency.\r\n\r\nI do not say that this is the right system. I only advance it to\r\nemphasize my belief that there is need for the adoption of some system\r\nwhich shall be automatic and open to all sound banks, so as to avoid\r\nall possibility of discrimination and favoritism. Such a plan would\r\ntend to prevent the spasms of high money and speculation which now\r\nobtain in the New York market; for at present there is too much\r\ncurrency at certain seasons of the year, and its accumulation at New\r\nYork tempts bankers to lend it at low rates for speculative purposes;\r\nwhereas at other times when the crops are being moved there is urgent\r\nneed for a large but temporary increase in the currency supply. It must\r\nnever be forgotten that this question concerns business men generally\r\nquite as much as bankers; especially is this true of stockmen, farmers,\r\nand business men in the West; for at present at certain seasons of the\r\nyear the difference in interest rates between the East and the West is\r\nfrom 6 to 10 per cent, whereas in Canada the corresponding difference\r\nis but 2 per cent. Any plan must, of course, guard the interests of\r\nwestern and southern bankers as carefully as it guards the interests of\r\nNew York or Chicago bankers; and must be drawn from the standpoints of\r\nthe farmer and the merchant no less than from the standpoints of the\r\ncity banker and the country banker.\r\n\r\nThe law should be amended so as specifically to provide that the funds\r\nderived from customs duties may be treated by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury as he treats funds obtained under the internal-revenue laws.\r\nThere should be a considerable increase in bills of small\r\ndenominations. Permission should be given banks, if necessary under\r\nsettled restrictions, to retire their circulation to a larger amount\r\nthan three millions a month.\r\n\r\nI most earnestly hope that the bill to provide a lower tariff for or\r\nelse absolute free trade in Philippine products will become a law. No\r\nharm will come to any American industry; and while there will be some\r\nsmall but real material benefit to the Filipinos, the main benefit will\r\ncome by the showing made as to our purpose to do all in our power for\r\ntheir welfare. So far our action in the Philippines has been abundantly\r\njustified, not mainly and indeed not primarily because of the added\r\ndignity it has given us as a nation by proving that we are capable\r\nhonorably and efficiently to bear the international burdens which a\r\nmighty people should bear, but even more because of the immense benefit\r\nthat has come to the people of the Philippine Islands. In these islands\r\nwe are steadily introducing both liberty and order, to a greater degree\r\nthan their people have ever before known. We have secured justice. We\r\nhave provided an efficient police force, and have put down ladronism.\r\nOnly in the islands of Leyte and Samar is the authority of our\r\nGovernment resisted and this by wild mountain tribes under the\r\nsuperstitious inspiration of fakirs and pseudo-religions leaders. We\r\nare constantly increasing the measure of liberty accorded the\r\nislanders, and next spring, if conditions warrant, we shall take a\r\ngreat stride forward in testing their capacity for self-government by\r\nsummoning the first Filipino legislative assembly; and the way in which\r\nthey stand this test will largely determine whether the self-government\r\nthus granted will be increased or decreased; for if we have erred at\r\nall in the Philippines it has been in proceeding too rapidly in the\r\ndirection of granting a large measure of self-government. We are\r\nbuilding roads. We have, for the immeasurable good of the people,\r\narranged for the building of railroads. Let us also see to it that they\r\nare given free access to our markets. This nation owes no more\r\nimperative duty to itself and mankind than the duty of managing the\r\naffairs of all the islands under the American flag--the Philippines,\r\nPorto Rico, and Hawaii--so as to make it evident that it is in every\r\nway to their advantage that the flag should fly over them.\r\n\r\nAmerican citizenship should be conferred on the citizens of Porto Rico.\r\nThe harbor of San Juan in Porto Rico should be dredged and improved.\r\nThe expenses of the federal court of Porto Rico should be met from the\r\nFederal Treasury. The administration of the affairs of Porto Rico,\r\ntogether with those of the Philippines, Hawaii, and our other insular\r\npossessions, should all be directed under one executive department; by\r\npreference the Department of State or the Department of War.\r\n\r\nThe needs of Hawaii are peculiar; every aid should be given the\r\nislands; and our efforts should be unceasing to develop them along the\r\nlines of a community of small freeholders, not of great planters with\r\ncoolie-tilled estates. Situated as this Territory is, in the middle of\r\nthe Pacific, there are duties imposed upon this small community which\r\ndo not fall in like degree or manner upon any other American community.\r\nThis warrants our treating it differently from the way in which we\r\ntreat Territories contiguous to or surrounded by sister Territories or\r\nother States, and justifies the setting aside of a portion of our\r\nrevenues to be expended for educational and internal improvements\r\ntherein. Hawaii is now making an effort to secure immigration fit in\r\nthe end to assume the duties and burdens of full American citizenship,\r\nand whenever the leaders in the various industries of those islands\r\nfinally adopt our ideals and heartily join our administration in\r\nendeavoring to develop a middle class of substantial citizens, a way\r\nwill then be found to deal with the commercial and industrial problems\r\nwhich now appear to them so serious. The best Americanism is that which\r\naims for stability and permanency of prosperous citizenship, rather\r\nthan immediate returns on large masses of capital.\r\n\r\nAlaska's needs have been partially met, but there must be a complete\r\nreorganization of the governmental system, as I have before indicated\r\nto you. I ask your especial attention to this. Our fellow-citizens who\r\ndwell on the shores of Puget Sound with characteristic energy are\r\narranging to hold in Seattle the Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition. Its\r\nspecial aims include the upbuilding of Alaska and the development of\r\nAmerican commerce on the Pacific Ocean. This exposition, in its\r\npurposes and scope, should appeal not only to the people of the Pacific\r\nslope, but to the people of the United States at large. Alaska since it\r\nwas bought has yielded to the Government eleven millions of dollars of\r\nrevenue, and has produced nearly three hundred millions of dollars in\r\ngold, furs, and fish. When properly developed it will become in large\r\ndegree a land of homes. The countries bordering the Pacific Ocean have\r\na population more numerous than that of all the countries of Europe;\r\ntheir annual foreign commerce amounts to over three billions of\r\ndollars, of which the share of the United States is some seven hundred\r\nmillions of dollars. If this trade were thoroughly understood and\r\npushed by our manufacturers and producers, the industries not only of\r\nthe Pacific slope, but of all our country, and particularly of our\r\ncotton-growing States, would be greatly benefited. Of course, in order\r\nto get these benefits, we must treat fairly the countries with which we\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake, and it betrays a spirit of foolish cynicism, to\r\nmaintain that all international governmental action is, and must ever\r\nbe, based upon mere selfishness, and that to advance ethical reasons\r\nfor such action is always a sign of hypocrisy. This is no more\r\nnecessarily true of the action of governments than of the action of\r\nindividuals. It is a sure sign of a base nature always to ascribe base\r\nmotives for the actions of others. Unquestionably no nation can afford\r\nto disregard proper considerations of self-interest, any more than a\r\nprivate individual can so do. But it is equally true that the average\r\nprivate individual in any really decent community does many actions\r\nwith reference to other men in which he is guided, not by\r\nself-interest, but by public spirit, by regard for the rights of\r\nothers, by a disinterested purpose to do good to others, and to raise\r\nthe tone of the community as a whole. Similarly, a really great nation\r\nmust often act, and as a matter of fact often does act, toward other\r\nnations in a spirit not in the least of mere self-interest, but paying\r\nheed chiefly to ethical reasons; and as the centuries go by this\r\ndisinterestedness in international action, this tendency of the\r\nindividuals comprising a nation to require that nation to act with\r\njustice toward its neighbors, steadily grows and strengthens. It is\r\nneither wise nor right for a nation to disregard its own needs, and it\r\nis foolish--and may be wicked--to think that other nations will\r\ndisregard theirs. But it is wicked for a nation only to regard its own\r\ninterest, and foolish to believe that such is the sole motive that\r\nactuates any other nation. It should be our steady aim to raise the\r\nethical standard of national action just as we strive to raise the\r\nethical standard of individual action.\r\n\r\nNot only must we treat all nations fairly, but we must treat with\r\njustice and good will all immigrants who come here under the law.\r\nWhether they are Catholic or Protestant, Jew or Gentile; whether they\r\ncome from England or Germany, Russia, Japan, or Italy, matters nothing.\r\nAll we have a right to question is the man's conduct. If he is honest\r\nand upright in his dealings with his neighbor and with the State, then\r\nhe is entitled to respect and good treatment. Especially do we need to\r\nremember our duty to the stranger within our gates. It is the sure mark\r\nof a low civilization, a low morality, to abuse or discriminate against\r\nor in any way humiliate such stranger who has come here lawfully and\r\nwho is conducting himself properly. To remember this is incumbent on\r\nevery American citizen, and it is of course peculiarly incumbent on\r\nevery Government official, whether of the nation or of the several\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nI am prompted to say this by the attitude of hostility here and there\r\nassumed toward the Japanese in this country. This hostility is sporadic\r\nand is limited to a very few places. Nevertheless, it is most\r\ndiscreditable to us as a people, and it may be fraught with the gravest\r\nconsequences to the nation. The friendship between the United States\r\nand Japan has been continuous since the time, over half a century ago,\r\nwhen Commodore Perry, by his expedition to Japan, first opened the\r\nislands to western civilization. Since then the growth of Japan has\r\nbeen literally astounding. There is not only nothing to parallel it,\r\nbut nothing to approach it in the history of civilized mankind. Japan\r\nhas a glorious and ancient past. Her civilization is older than that of\r\nthe nations of northern Europe--the nations from whom the people of the\r\nUnited States have chiefly sprung. But fifty years ago Japan's\r\ndevelopment was still that of the Middle Ages. During that fifty years\r\nthe progress of the country in every walk in life has been a marvel to\r\nmankind, and she now stands as one of the greatest of civilized\r\nnations; great in the arts of war and in the arts of peace; great in\r\nmilitary, in industrial, in artistic development and achievement.\r\nJapanese soldiers and sailors have shown themselves equal in combat to\r\nany of whom history makes note. She has produced great generals and\r\nmighty admirals; her fighting men, afloat and ashore, show all the\r\nheroic courage, the unquestioning, unfaltering loyalty, the splendid\r\nindifference to hardship and death, which marked the Loyal Ronins; and\r\nthey show also that they possess the highest ideal of patriotism.\r\nJapanese artists of every kind see their products eagerly sought for in\r\nall lands. The industrial and commercial development of Japan has been\r\nphenomenal; greater than that of any other country during the same\r\nperiod. At the same time the advance in science and philosophy is no\r\nless marked. The admirable management of the Japanese Red Cross during\r\nthe late war, the efficiency and humanity of the Japanese officials,\r\nnurses, and doctors, won the respectful admiration of all acquainted\r\nwith the facts. Through the Red Cross the Japanese people sent over\r\n$100,000 to the sufferers of San Francisco, and the gift was accepted\r\nwith gratitude by our people. The courtesy of the Japanese, nationally\r\nand individually, has become proverbial. To no other country has there\r\nbeen such an increasing number of visitors from this land as to Japan.\r\nIn return, Japanese have come here in great numbers. They are welcome,\r\nsocially and intellectually, in all our colleges and institutions of\r\nhigher learning, in all our professional and social bodies. The\r\nJapanese have won in a single generation the right to stand abreast of\r\nthe foremost and most enlightened peoples of Europe and America; they\r\nhave won on their own merits and by their own exertions the right to\r\ntreatment on a basis of full and frank equality. The overwhelming mass\r\nof our people cherish a lively regard and respect for the people of\r\nJapan, and in almost every quarter of the Union the stranger from Japan\r\nis treated as he deserves; that is, he is treated as the stranger from\r\nany part of civilized Europe is and deserves to be treated. But here\r\nand there a most unworthy feeling has manifested itself toward the\r\nJapanese--the feeling that has been shown in shutting them out from the\r\ncommon schools in San Francisco, and in mutterings against them in one\r\nor two other places, because of their efficiency as workers. To shut\r\nthem out from the public schools is a wicked absurdity, when there are\r\nno first-class colleges in the land, including the universities and\r\ncolleges of California, which do not gladly welcome Japanese students\r\nand on which Japanese students do not reflect credit. We have as much\r\nto learn from Japan as Japan has to learn from us; and no nation is fit\r\nto teach unless it is also willing to learn. Throughout Japan Americans\r\nare well treated, and any failure on the part of Americans at home to\r\ntreat the Japanese with a like courtesy and consideration is by just so\r\nmuch a confession of inferiority in our civilization.\r\n\r\nOur nation fronts on the Pacific, just as it fronts on the Atlantic. We\r\nhope to play a constantly growing part in the great ocean of the\r\nOrient. We wish, as we ought to wish, for a great commercial\r\ndevelopment in our dealings with Asia; and it is out of the question\r\nthat we should permanently have such development unless we freely and\r\ngladly extend to other nations the same measure of justice and good\r\ntreatment which we expect to receive in return. It is only a very small\r\nbody of our citizens that act badly. Where the Federal Government has\r\npower it will deal summarily with any such. Where the several States\r\nhave power I earnestly ask that they also deal wisely and promptly with\r\nsuch conduct, or else this small body of wrongdoers may bring shame\r\nupon the great mass of their innocent and right-thinking fellows--that\r\nis, upon our nation as a whole. Good manners should be an international\r\nno less than an individual attribute. I ask fair treatment for the\r\nJapanese as I would ask fair treatment for Germans or Englishmen,\r\nFrenchmen, Russians, or Italians. I ask it as due to humanity and\r\ncivilization. I ask it as due to ourselves because we must act\r\nuprightly toward all men.\r\n\r\nI recommend to the Congress that an act be past specifically providing\r\nfor the naturalization of Japanese who come here intending to become\r\nAmerican citizens. One of the great embarrassments attending the\r\nperformance of our international obligations is the fact that the\r\nStatutes of the United States are entirely inadequate. They fail to\r\ngive to the National Government sufficiently ample power, through\r\nUnited States courts and by the use of the Army and Navy, to protect\r\naliens in the rights secured to them under solemn treaties which are\r\nthe law of the land. I therefore earnestly recommend that the criminal\r\nand civil statutes of the United States be so amended and added to as\r\nto enable the President, acting for the United States Government, which\r\nis responsible in our international relations, to enforce the rights of\r\naliens under treaties. Even as the law now is something can be done by\r\nthe Federal Government toward this end, and in the matter now before me\r\naffecting the Japanese everything that it is in my power to do will be\r\ndone, and all of the forces, military and civil, of the United States\r\nwhich I may lawfully employ will be so employed. There should, however,\r\nbe no particle of doubt as to the power of the National Government\r\ncompletely to perform and enforce its own obligations to other nations.\r\nThe mob of a single city may at any time perform acts of lawless\r\nviolence against some class of foreigners which would plunge us into\r\nwar. That city by itself would be powerless to make defense against the\r\nforeign power thus assaulted, and if independent of this Government it\r\nwould never venture to perform or permit the performance of the acts\r\ncomplained of. The entire power and the whole duty to protect the\r\noffending city or the offending community lies in the hands of the\r\nUnited States Government. It is unthinkable that we should continue a\r\npolicy under which a given locality may be allowed to commit a crime\r\nagainst a friendly nation, and the United States Government limited,\r\nnot to preventing the commission of the crime, but, in the last resort,\r\nto defending the people who have committed it against the consequences\r\nof their own wrongdoing.\r\n\r\nLast August an insurrection broke out in Cuba which it speedily grew\r\nevident that the existing Cuban Government was powerless to quell. This\r\nGovernment was repeatedly asked by the then Cuban Government to\r\nintervene, and finally was notified by the President of Cuba that he\r\nintended to resign; that his decision was irrevocable; that none of the\r\nother constitutional officers would consent to carry on the Government,\r\nand that he was powerless to maintain order. It was evident that chaos\r\nwas impending, and there was every probability that if steps were not\r\nimmediately taken by this Government to try to restore order the\r\nrepresentatives of various European nations in the island would apply\r\nto their respective governments for armed intervention in order to\r\nprotect the lives and property of their citizens. Thanks to the\r\npreparedness of our Navy, I was able immediately to send enough ships\r\nto Cuba to prevent the situation from becoming hopeless; and I\r\nfurthermore dispatched to Cuba the Secretary of War and the Assistant\r\nSecretary of State, in order that they might grapple with the situation\r\non the ground. All efforts to secure an agreement between the\r\ncontending factions, by which they should themselves come to an\r\namicable understanding and settle upon some modus vivendi--some\r\nprovisional government of their own--failed. Finally the President of\r\nthe Republic resigned. The quorum of Congress assembled failed by\r\ndeliberate purpose of its members, so that there was no power to act on\r\nhis resignation, and the Government came to a halt. In accordance with\r\nthe so-called Platt amendment, which was embodied in the constitution\r\nof Cuba, I thereupon proclaimed a provisional government for the\r\nisland, the Secretary of War acting as provisional governor until he\r\ncould be replaced by Mr. Magoon, the late minister to Panama and\r\ngovernor of the Canal Zone on the Isthmus; troops were sent to support\r\nthem and to relieve the Navy, the expedition being handled with most\r\nsatisfactory speed and efficiency. The insurgent chiefs immediately\r\nagreed that their troops should lay down their arms and disband; and\r\nthe agreement was carried out. The provisional government has left the\r\npersonnel of the old government and the old laws, so far as might be,\r\nunchanged, and will thus administer the island for a few months until\r\ntranquillity can be restored, a new election properly held, and a new\r\ngovernment inaugurated. Peace has come in the island; and the\r\nharvesting of the sugar-cane crop, the great crop of the island, is\r\nabout to proceed.\r\n\r\nWhen the election has been held and the new government inaugurated in\r\npeaceful and orderly fashion the provisional government will come to an\r\nend. I take this opportunity of expressing upon behalf of the American\r\npeople, with all possible solemnity, our most earnest hope that the\r\npeople of Cuba will realize the imperative need of preserving justice\r\nand keeping order in the Island. The United States wishes nothing of\r\nCuba except that it shall prosper morally and materially, and wishes\r\nnothing of the Cubans save that they shall be able to preserve order\r\namong themselves and therefore to preserve their independence. If the\r\nelections become a farce, and if the insurrectionary habit becomes\r\nconfirmed in the Island, it is absolutely out of the question that the\r\nIsland should continue independent; and the United States, which has\r\nassumed the sponsorship before the civilized world for Cuba's career as\r\na nation, would again have to intervene and to see that the government\r\nwas managed in such orderly fashion as to secure the safety of life and\r\nproperty. The path to be trodden by those who exercise self-government\r\nis always hard, and we should have every charity and patience with the\r\nCubans as they tread this difficult path. I have the utmost sympathy\r\nwith, and regard for, them; but I most earnestly adjure them solemnly\r\nto weigh their responsibilities and to see that when their new\r\ngovernment is started it shall run smoothly, and with freedom from\r\nflagrant denial of right on the one hand, and from insurrectionary\r\ndisturbances on the other.\r\n\r\nThe Second International Conference of American Republics, held in\r\nMexico in the years 1901-2, provided for the holding of the third\r\nconference within five years, and committed the fixing of the time and\r\nplace and the arrangements for the conference to the governing board of\r\nthe Bureau of American Republics, composed of the representatives of\r\nall the American nations in Washington. That board discharged the duty\r\nimposed upon it with marked fidelity and painstaking care, and upon the\r\ncourteous invitation of the United States of Brazil the conference was\r\nheld at Rio de Janeiro, continuing from the 23d of July to the 29th of\r\nAugust last. Many subjects of common interest to all the American\r\nnations were discust by the conference, and the conclusions reached,\r\nembodied in a series of resolutions and proposed conventions, will be\r\nlaid before you upon the coming in of the final report of the American\r\ndelegates. They contain many matters of importance relating to the\r\nextension of trade, the increase of communication, the smoothing away\r\nof barriers to free intercourse, and the promotion of a better\r\nknowledge and good understanding between the different countries\r\nrepresented. The meetings of the conference were harmonious and the\r\nconclusions were reached with substantial unanimity. It is interesting\r\nto observe that in the successive conferences which have been held the\r\nrepresentatives of the different American nations have been learning to\r\nwork together effectively, for, while the First Conference in\r\nWashington in 1889, and the Second Conference in Mexico in 1901-2,\r\noccupied many months, with much time wasted in an unregulated and\r\nfruitless discussion, the Third Conference at Rio exhibited much of the\r\nfacility in the practical dispatch of business which characterizes\r\npermanent deliberative bodies, and completed its labors within the\r\nperiod of six weeks originally allotted for its sessions.\r\n\r\nQuite apart from the specific value of the conclusions reached by the\r\nconference, the example of the representatives of all the American\r\nnations engaging in harmonious and kindly consideration and discussion\r\nof subjects of common interest is itself of great and substantial value\r\nfor the promotion of reasonable and considerate treatment of all\r\ninternational questions. The thanks of this country are due to the\r\nGovernment of Brazil and to the people of Rio de Janeiro for the\r\ngenerous hospitality with which our delegates, in common with the\r\nothers, were received, entertained, and facilitated in their work.\r\n\r\nIncidentally to the meeting of the conference, the Secretary of State\r\nvisited the city of Rio de Janeiro and was cordially received by the\r\nconference, of which he was made an honorary president. The\r\nannouncement of his intention to make this visit was followed by most\r\ncourteous and urgent invitations from nearly all the countries of South\r\nAmerica to visit them as the guest of their Governments. It was deemed\r\nthat by the acceptance of these invitations we might appropriately\r\nexpress the real respect and friendship in which we hold our sister\r\nRepublics of the southern continent, and the Secretary, accordingly,\r\nvisited Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Panama, and Colombia.\r\nHe refrained from visiting Paraguay, Bolivia, and Ecuador only because\r\nthe distance of their capitals from the seaboard made it impracticable\r\nwith the time at his disposal. He carried with him a message of peace\r\nand friendship, and of strong desire for good understanding and mutual\r\nhelpfulness; and he was everywhere received in the spirit of his\r\nmessage. The members of government, the press, the learned professions,\r\nthe men of business, and the great masses of the people united\r\neverywhere in emphatic response to his friendly expressions and in\r\ndoing honor to the country and cause which he represented.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of South America there has been much misunderstanding of\r\nthe attitude and purposes of the United States towards the other\r\nAmerican Republics. An idea had become prevalent that our assertion of\r\nthe Monroe Doctrine implied, or carried with it, an assumption of\r\nsuperiority, and of a right to exercise some kind of protectorate over\r\nthe countries to whose territory that doctrine applies. Nothing could\r\nbe farther from the truth. Yet that impression continued to be a\r\nserious barrier to good understanding, to friendly intercourse, to the\r\nintroduction of American capital and the extension of American trade.\r\nThe impression was so widespread that apparently it could not be\r\nreached by any ordinary means.\r\n\r\nIt was part of Secretary Root's mission to dispel this unfounded\r\nimpression, and there is just cause to believe that he has succeeded.\r\nIn an address to the Third Conference at Rio on the 31st of July--an\r\naddress of such note that I send it in, together with this message--he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"We wish for no victories but those of peace; for no territory except\r\nour own; for no sovereignty except the sovereignty over ourselves. We\r\ndeem the independence and equal rights of the smallest and weakest\r\nmember of the family of nations entitled to as much respect as those of\r\nthe greatest empire, and we deem the observance of that respect the\r\nchief guaranty of the weak against the oppression of the strong. We\r\nneither claim nor desire any rights or privileges or powers that we do\r\nnot freely concede to every American Republic. We wish to increase our\r\nprosperity, to extend our trade, to grow in wealth, in wisdom, and in\r\nspirit, but our conception of the true way to accomplish this is not to\r\npull down others and profit by their ruin, but to help all friends to a\r\ncommon prosperity and a common growth, that we may all become greater\r\nand stronger together. Within a few months for the first time the\r\nrecognized possessors of every foot of soil upon the American\r\ncontinents can be and I hope will be represented with the acknowledged\r\nrights of equal sovereign states in the great World Congress at The\r\nHague. This will be the world's formal and final acceptance of the\r\ndeclaration that no part of the American continents is to be deemed\r\nsubject to colonization. Let us pledge ourselves to aid each other in\r\nthe full performance of the duty to humanity which that accepted\r\ndeclaration implies, so that in time the weakest and most unfortunate\r\nof our Republics may come to march with equal step by the side of the\r\nstronger and more fortunate. Let us help each other to show that for\r\nall the races of men the liberty for which we have fought and labored\r\nis the twin sister of justice and peace. Let us unite in creating and\r\nmaintaining and making effective an all-American public opinion, whose\r\npower shall influence international conduct and prevent international\r\nwrong, and narrow the causes of war, and forever preserve our free\r\nlands from the burden of such armaments as are massed behind the\r\nfrontiers of Europe, and bring us ever nearer to the perfection of\r\nordered liberty. So shall come security and prosperity, production and\r\ntrade, wealth, learning, the arts, and happiness for us all.\"\r\n\r\nThese words appear to have been received with acclaim in every part of\r\nSouth America. They have my hearty approval, as I am sure they will\r\nhave yours, and I can not be wrong in the conviction that they\r\ncorrectly represent the sentiments of the whole American people. I can\r\nnot better characterize the true attitude of the United States in its\r\nassertion of the Monroe Doctrine than in the words of the distinguished\r\nformer minister of foreign affairs of Argentina, Doctor Drago, in his\r\nspeech welcoming Mr. Root at Buenos Ayres. He spoke of--\r\n\r\n\"The traditional policy of the United States (which) without\r\naccentuating superiority or seeking preponderance, condemned the\r\noppression of the nations of this part of the world and the control of\r\ntheir destinies by the great Powers of Europe.\"\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to know that in the great city of Buenos Ayres, upon\r\nthe arches which spanned the streets, entwined with Argentine and\r\nAmerican flags for the reception of our representative, there were\r\nemblazoned not' only the names of Washington and Jefferson and\r\nMarshall, but also, in appreciative recognition of their services to\r\nthe cause of South American independence, the names of James Monroe,\r\nJohn Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, and Richard Rush. We take especial\r\npleasure in the graceful courtesy of the Government of Brazil, which\r\nhas given to the beautiful and stately building first used for the\r\nmeeting of the conference the name of \"Palacio Monroe.\" Our grateful\r\nacknowledgments are due to the Governments and the people of all the\r\ncountries visited by the Secretary of State for the courtesy, the\r\nfriendship, and the honor shown to our country in their generous\r\nhospitality to him.\r\n\r\nIn my message to you on the 5th of December, 1905, I called your\r\nattention to the embarrassment that might be caused to this Government\r\nby the assertion by foreign nations of the right to collect by force of\r\narms contract debts due by American republics to citizens of the\r\ncollecting nation, and to the danger that the process of compulsory\r\ncollection might result in the occupation of territory tending to\r\nbecome permanent. I then said:\r\n\r\n\"Our own Government has always refused to enforce such contractual\r\nobligations on behalf of its citizens by an appeal to arms. It is much\r\nto be wisht that all foreign governments would take the same view.\"\r\n\r\nThis subject was one of the topics of consideration at the conference\r\nat Rio and a resolution was adopted by that conference recommending to\r\nthe respective governments represented \"to consider the advisability of\r\nasking the Second Peace Conference at The Hague to examine the question\r\nof the compulsory collection of public debts, and, in general, means\r\ntending to diminish among nations conflicts of purely pecuniary\r\norigin.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution was supported by the representatives of the United\r\nStates in accordance with the following instructions:\r\n\r\n\"It has long been the established policy of the United States not to\r\nuse its armed forces for the collection of ordinary contract debts due\r\nto its citizens by other governments. We have not considered the use of\r\nforce for such a purpose consistent with that respect for the\r\nindependent sovereignty of other members of the family of nations which\r\nis the most important principle of international law and the chief\r\nprotection of weak nations against the oppression of the strong. It\r\nseems to us that the practise is injurious in its general effect upon\r\nthe relations of nations and upon the welfare of weak and disordered\r\nstates, whose development ought to be encouraged in the interests of\r\ncivilization; that it offers frequent temptation to bullying and\r\noppression and to unnecessary and unjustifiable warfare. We regret that\r\nother powers, whose opinions and sense of justice we esteem highly,\r\nhave at times taken a different view and have permitted themselves,\r\nthough we believe with reluctance, to collect such debts by force. It\r\nis doubtless true that the non-payment of public debts may be\r\naccompanied by such circumstances of fraud and wrongdoing or violation\r\nof treaties as to justify the use of force. This Government would be\r\nglad to see an international consideration of the subject which shall\r\ndiscriminate between such cases and the simple nonperformance of a\r\ncontract with a private person, and a resolution in favor of reliance\r\nupon peaceful means in cases of the latter class.\r\n\r\n\"It is not felt, however, that the conference at Rio should undertake\r\nto make such a discrimination or to resolve upon such a rule. Most of\r\nthe American countries are still debtor nations, while the countries of\r\nEurope are the creditors. If the Rio conference, therefore, were to\r\ntake such action it would have the appearance of a meeting of debtors\r\nresolving how their creditors should act, and this would not inspire\r\nrespect. The true course is indicated by the terms of the program,\r\nwhich proposes to request the Second Hague Conference, where both\r\ncreditors and debtors will be assembled, to consider the subject.\"\r\n\r\nLast June trouble which had existed for some time between the Republics\r\nof Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras culminated in war--a war which\r\nthreatened to be ruinous to the countries involved and very destructive\r\nto the commercial interests of Americans, Mexicans, and other\r\nforeigners who are taking an important part in the development of these\r\ncountries. The thoroughly good understanding which exists between the\r\nUnited States and Mexico enabled this Government and that of Mexico to\r\nunite in effective mediation between the warring Republics; which\r\nmediation resulted, not without long-continued and patient effort, in\r\nbringing about a meeting of the representatives of the hostile powers\r\non board a United States warship as neutral territory, and peace was\r\nthere concluded; a peace which resulted in the saving of thousands of\r\nlives and in the prevention of an incalculable amount of misery and the\r\ndestruction of property and of the means of livelihood. The Rio\r\nConference past the following resolution in reference to this action:\r\n\r\n\"That the Third International American Conference shall address to the\r\nPresidents of the United States of America and of the United States of\r\nMexico a note in which the conference which is being held at Rio\r\nexpresses its satisfaction at the happy results of their mediation for\r\nthe celebration of peace between the Republics of Guatemala, Honduras,\r\nand Salvador.\"\r\n\r\nThis affords an excellent example of one way in which the influence of\r\nthe United States can properly be exercised for the benefit of the\r\npeoples of the Western Hemisphere; that is, by action taken in concert\r\nwith other American republics and therefore free from those suspicions\r\nand prejudices which might attach if the action were taken by one\r\nalone. In this way it is possible to exercise a powerful influence\r\ntoward the substitution of considerate action in the spirit of justice\r\nfor the insurrectionary or international violence which has hitherto\r\nbeen so great a hindrance to the development of many of our neighbors.\r\nRepeated examples of united action by several or many American\r\nrepublics in favor of peace, by urging cool and reasonable, instead of\r\nexcited and belligerent, treatment of international controversies, can\r\nnot fail to promote the growth of a general public opinion among the\r\nAmerican nations which will elevate the standards of international\r\naction, strengthen the sense of international duty among governments,\r\nand tell in favor of the peace of mankind.\r\n\r\nI have just returned from a trip to Panama and shall report to you at\r\nlength later on the whole subject of the Panama Canal.\r\n\r\nThe Algeciras Convention, which was signed by the United States as well\r\nas by most of the powers of Europe, supersedes the previous convention\r\nof 1880, which was also signed both by the United States and a majority\r\nof the European powers. This treaty confers upon us equal commercial\r\nrights with all European countries and does not entail a single\r\nobligation of any kind upon us, and I earnestly hope it may be speedily\r\nratified. To refuse to ratify it would merely mean that we forfeited\r\nour commercial rights in Morocco and would not achieve another object\r\nof any kind. In the event of such refusal we would be left for the\r\nfirst time in a hundred and twenty years without any commercial treaty\r\nwith Morocco; and this at a time when we are everywhere seeking new\r\nmarkets and outlets for trade.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the Pribilof Islands fur seals by pelagic sealing\r\nstill continues. The herd which, according to the surveys made in 1874\r\nby direction of the Congress, numbered 4,700,000, and which, according\r\nto the survey of both American and Canadian commissioners in 1891,\r\namounted to 1,000,000, has now been reduced to about 180,000. This\r\nresult has been brought about by Canadian and some other sealing\r\nvessels killing the female seals while in the water during their annual\r\npilgrimage to and from the south, or in search of food. As a rule the\r\nfemale seal when killed is pregnant, and also has an unweaned pup on\r\nland, so that, for each skin taken by pelagic sealing, as a rule, three\r\nlives are destroyed--the mother, the unborn offspring, and the nursing\r\npup, which is left to starve to death. No damage whatever is done to\r\nthe herd by the carefully regulated killing on land; the custom of\r\npelagic sealing is solely responsible for all of the present evil, and\r\nis alike indefensible from the economic standpoint and from the\r\nstandpoint of humanity.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 over 16,000 young seals were found dead from starvation on the\r\nPribilof Islands. In 1897 it was estimated that since pelagic sealing\r\nbegan upward of 400,000 adult female seals had been killed at sea, and\r\nover 300,000 young seals had died of starvation as the result. The\r\nrevolting barbarity of such a practise, as well as the wasteful\r\ndestruction which it involves, needs no demonstration and is its own\r\ncondemnation. The Bering Sea Tribunal, which sat in Paris in 1893, and\r\nwhich decided against the claims of the United States to exclusive\r\njurisdiction in the waters of Bering Sea and to a property right in the\r\nfur seals when outside of the three-mile limit, determined also upon\r\ncertain regulations which the Tribunal considered sufficient for the\r\nproper protection and preservation of the fur seal in, or habitually\r\nresorting to, the Bering Sea. The Tribunal by its regulations\r\nestablished a close season, from the 1st of May to the 31st of July,\r\nand excluded all killing in the waters within 60 miles around the\r\nPribilof Islands. They also provided that the regulations which they\r\nhad determined upon, with a view to the protection and preservation of\r\nthe seals, should be submitted every five years to new examination, so\r\nas to enable both interested Governments to consider whether, in the\r\nlight of past experience, there was occasion for any modification\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nThe regulations have proved plainly inadequate to accomplish the object\r\nof protection and preservation of the fur seals, and for a long time\r\nthis Government has been trying in vain to secure from Great Britain\r\nsuch revision and modification of the regulations as were contemplated\r\nand provided for by the award of the Tribunal of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe process of destruction has been accelerated during recent years by\r\nthe appearance of a number of Japanese vessels engaged in pelagic\r\nsealing. As these vessels have not been bound even by the inadequate\r\nlimitations prescribed by the Tribunal of Paris, they have paid no\r\nattention either to the close season or to the sixty-mile limit imposed\r\nupon the Canadians, and have prosecuted their work up to the very\r\nislands themselves. On July 16 and 17 the crews from several Japanese\r\nvessels made raids upon the island of St. Paul, and before they were\r\nbeaten off by the very meager and insufficiently armed guard, they\r\nsucceeded in killing several hundred seals and carrying off the skins\r\nof most of them. Nearly all the seals killed were females and the work\r\nwas done with frightful barbarity. Many of the seals appear to have\r\nbeen skinned alive and many were found half skinned and still alive.\r\nThe raids were repelled only by the use of firearms, and five of the\r\nraiders were killed, two were wounded, and twelve captured, including\r\nthe two wounded. Those captured have since been tried and sentenced to\r\nimprisonment. An attack of this kind had been wholly unlookt for, but\r\nsuch provision of vessels, arms, and ammunition will now be made that\r\nits repetition will not be found profitable.\r\n\r\nSuitable representations regarding the incident have been made to the\r\nGovernment of Japan, and we are assured that all practicable measures\r\nwill be taken by that country to prevent any recurrence of the outrage.\r\nOn our part, the guard on the island will be increased and better\r\nequipped and organized, and a better revenue-cutter patrol service\r\nabout the islands will be established; next season a United States war\r\nvessel will also be sent there.\r\n\r\nWe have not relaxed our efforts to secure an agreement with Great\r\nBritain for adequate protection of the seal herd, and negotiations with\r\nJapan for the same purpose are in progress.\r\n\r\nThe laws for the protection of the seals within the jurisdiction of the\r\nUnited States need revision and amendment. Only the islands of St. Paul\r\nand St. George are now, in terms, included in the Government\r\nreservation, and the other islands are also to be included. The landing\r\nof aliens as well as citizens upon the islands, without a permit from\r\nthe Department of Commerce and Labor, for any purpose except in case of\r\nstress of weather or for water, should be prohibited under adequate\r\npenalties. The approach of vessels for the excepted purposes should be\r\nregulated. The authority of the Government agents on the islands should\r\nbe enlarged, and the chief agent should have the powers of a committing\r\nmagistrate. The entrance of a vessel into the territorial waters\r\nsurrounding the islands with intent to take seals should be made a\r\ncriminal offense and cause of forfeiture. Authority for seizures in\r\nsuch cases should be given and the presence on any such vessel of seals\r\nor sealskins, or the paraphernalia for taking them, should be made\r\nprima facie evidence of such intent. I recommend what legislation is\r\nneeded to accomplish these ends; and I commend to your attention the\r\nreport of Mr. Sims, of the Department of Commerce and Labor, on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIn case we are compelled to abandon the hope of making arrangements\r\nwith other governments to put an end to the hideous cruelty now\r\nincident to pelagic sealing, it will be a question for your serious\r\nconsideration how far we should continue to protect and maintain the\r\nseal herd on land with the result of continuing such a practise, and\r\nwhether it is not better to end the practice by exterminating the herd\r\nourselves in the most humane way possible.\r\n\r\nIn my last message I advised you that the Emperor of Russia had taken\r\nthe initiative in bringing about a second peace conference at The\r\nHague. Under the guidance of Russia the arrangement of the\r\npreliminaries for such a conference has been progressing during the\r\npast year. Progress has necessarily been slow, owing to the great\r\nnumber of countries to be consulted upon every question that has\r\narisen. It is a matter of satisfaction that all of the American\r\nRepublics have now, for the first time, been invited to join in the\r\nproposed conference.\r\n\r\nThe close connection between the subjects to be taken up by the Red\r\nCross Conference held at Geneva last summer and the subjects which\r\nnaturally would come before The Hague Conference made it apparent that\r\nit was desirable to have the work of the Red Cross Conference completed\r\nand considered by the different powers before the meeting at The Hague.\r\nThe Red Cross Conference ended its labors on the 6th day of July, and\r\nthe revised and amended convention, which was signed by the American\r\ndelegates, will be promptly laid before the Senate.\r\n\r\nBy the special and highly appreciated courtesy of the Governments of\r\nRussia and the Netherlands, a proposal to call The Hague Conference\r\ntogether at a time which would conflict with the Conference of the\r\nAmerican Republics at Rio de Janeiro in August was laid aside. No other\r\ndate has yet been suggested. A tentative program for the conference has\r\nbeen proposed by the Government of Russia, and the subjects which it\r\nenumerates are undergoing careful examination and consideration in\r\npreparation for the conference.\r\n\r\nIt must ever be kept in mind that war is not merely justifiable, but\r\nimperative, upon honorable men, upon an honorable nation, where peace\r\ncan only be obtained by the sacrifice of conscientious conviction or of\r\nnational welfare. Peace is normally a great good, and normally it\r\ncoincides with righteousness; but it is righteousness and not peace\r\nwhich should bind the conscience of a nation as it should bind the\r\nconscience of an individual; and neither a nation nor an individual can\r\nsurrender conscience to another's keeping. Neither can a nation, which\r\nis an entity, and which does not die as individuals die, refrain from\r\ntaking thought for the interest of the generations that are to come, no\r\nless than for the interest of the generation of to-day; and no public\r\nmen have a right, whether from shortsightedness, from selfish\r\nindifference, or from sentimentality, to sacrifice national interests\r\nwhich are vital in character. A just war is in the long run far better\r\nfor a nation's soul than the most prosperous peace obtained by\r\nacquiescence in wrong or injustice. Moreover, though it is criminal for\r\na nation not to prepare for war, so that it may escape the dreadful\r\nconsequences of being defeated in war, yet it must always be remembered\r\nthat even to be defeated in war may be far better than not to have\r\nfought at all. As has been well and finely said, a beaten nation is not\r\nnecessarily a disgraced nation; but the nation or man is disgraced if\r\nthe obligation to defend right is shirked.\r\n\r\nWe should as a nation do everything in our power for the cause of\r\nhonorable peace. It is morally as indefensible for a nation to commit a\r\nwrong upon another nation, strong or weak, as for an individual thus to\r\nwrong his fellows. We should do all in our power to hasten the day when\r\nthere shall be peace among the nations--a peace based upon justice and\r\nnot upon cowardly submission to wrong. We can accomplish a good deal in\r\nthis direction, but we can not accomplish everything, and the penalty\r\nof attempting to do too much would almost inevitably be to do worse\r\nthan nothing; for it must be remembered that fantastic extremists are\r\nnot in reality leaders of the causes which they espouse, but are\r\nordinarily those who do most to hamper the real leaders of the cause\r\nand to damage the cause itself. As yet there is no likelihood of\r\nestablishing any kind of international power, of whatever sort, which\r\ncan effectively check wrongdoing, and in these circumstances it would\r\nbe both a foolish and an evil thing for a great and free nation to\r\ndeprive itself of the power to protect its own rights and even in\r\nexceptional cases to stand up for the rights of others. Nothing would\r\nmore promote iniquity, nothing would further defer the reign upon earth\r\nof peace and righteousness, than for the free and enlightened peoples\r\nwhich, though with much stumbling and many shortcomings, nevertheless\r\nstrive toward justice, deliberately to render themselves powerless\r\nwhile leaving every despotism and barbarism armed and able to work\r\ntheir wicked will. The chance for the settlement of disputes\r\npeacefully, by arbitration, now depends mainly upon the possession by\r\nthe nations that mean to do right of sufficient armed strength to make\r\ntheir purpose effective.\r\n\r\nThe United States Navy is the surest guarantor of peace which this\r\ncountry possesses. It is earnestly to be wisht that we would profit by\r\nthe teachings of history in this matter. A strong and wise people will\r\nstudy its own failures no less than its triumphs, for there is wisdom\r\nto be learned from the study of both, of the mistake as well as of the\r\nsuccess. For this purpose nothing could be more instructive than a\r\nrational study of the war of 1812, as it is told, for instance, by\r\nCaptain Mahan. There was only one way in which that war could have been\r\navoided. If during the preceding twelve years a navy relatively as\r\nstrong as that which this country now has had been built up, and an\r\narmy provided relatively as good as that which the country now has,\r\nthere never would have been the slightest necessity of fighting the\r\nwar; and if the necessity had arisen the war would under such\r\ncircumstances have ended with our speedy and overwhelming triumph. But\r\nour people during those twelve years refused to make any preparations\r\nwhatever, regarding either the Army or the Navy. They saved a million\r\nor two of dollars by so doing; and in mere money paid a hundredfold for\r\neach million they thus saved during the three years of war which\r\nfollowed--a war which brought untold suffering upon our people, which\r\nat one time threatened the gravest national disaster, and which, in\r\nspite of the necessity of waging it, resulted merely in what was in\r\neffect a drawn battle, while the balance of defeat and triumph was\r\nalmost even.\r\n\r\nI do not ask that we continue to increase our Navy. I ask merely that\r\nit be maintained at its present strength; and this can be done only if\r\nwe replace the obsolete and outworn ships by new and good ones, the\r\nequals of any afloat in any navy. To stop building ships for one year\r\nmeans that for that year the Navy goes back instead of forward. The old\r\nbattle ship Texas, for instance, would now be of little service in a\r\nstand-up fight with a powerful adversary. The old double-turret\r\nmonitors have outworn their usefulness, while it was a waste of money\r\nto build the modern single-turret monitors. All these ships should be\r\nreplaced by others; and this can be done by a well-settled program of\r\nproviding for the building each year of at least one first-class battle\r\nship equal in size and speed to any that any nation is at the same time\r\nbuilding; the armament presumably to consist of as large a number as\r\npossible of very heavy guns of one caliber, together with smaller guns\r\nto repel torpedo attack; while there should be heavy armor, turbine\r\nengines, and in short, every modern device. Of course, from time to\r\ntime, cruisers, colliers, torpedo-boat destroyers or torpedo boats,\r\nWill have to be built also. All this, be it remembered, would not\r\nincrease our Navy, but would merely keep it at its present strength.\r\nEqually of course, the ships will be absolutely useless if the men\r\naboard them are not so trained that they can get the best possible\r\nservice out of the formidable but delicate and complicated mechanisms\r\nintrusted to their care. The marksmanship of our men has so improved\r\nduring the last five years that I deem it within bounds to say that the\r\nNavy is more than twice as efficient, ship for ship, as half a decade\r\nago. The Navy can only attain proper efficiency if enough officers and\r\nmen are provided, and if these officers and men are given the chance\r\n(and required to take advantage of it) to stay continually at sea and\r\nto exercise the fleets singly and above all in squadron, the exercise\r\nto be of every kind and to include unceasing practise at the guns,\r\nconducted under conditions that will test marksmanship in time of war.\r\n\r\nIn both the Army and the Navy there is urgent need that everything\r\npossible should be done to maintain the highest standard for the\r\npersonnel, alike as regards the officers and the enlisted men. I do not\r\nbelieve that in any service there is a finer body of enlisted men and\r\nof junior officer than we have in both the Army and the Navy, including\r\nthe Marine Corps. All possible encouragement to the enlisted men should\r\nbe given, in pay and otherwise, and everything practicable done to\r\nrender the service attractive to men of the right type. They should be\r\nheld to the strictest discharge of their duty, and in them a spirit\r\nshould be encouraged which demands not the mere performance of duty,\r\nbut the performance of far more than duty, if it conduces to the honor\r\nand the interest of the American nation; and in return the amplest\r\nconsideration should be theirs.\r\n\r\nWest Point and Annapolis already turn out excellent officers. We do not\r\nneed to have these schools made more scholastic. On the contrary we\r\nshould never lose sight of the fact that the aim of each school is to\r\nturn out a man who shall be above everything else a fighting man. In\r\nthe Army in particular it is not necessary that either the cavalry or\r\ninfantry officer should have special mathematical ability. Probably in\r\nboth schools the best part of the education is the high standard of\r\ncharacter and of professional morale which it confers.\r\n\r\nBut in both services there is urgent need for the establishment of a\r\nprinciple of selection which will eliminate men after a certain age if\r\nthey can not be promoted from the subordinate ranks, and which will\r\nbring into the higher ranks fewer men, and these at an earlier age.\r\nThis principle of selection will be objected to by good men of mediocre\r\ncapacity, who are fitted to do well while young in the lower positions,\r\nbut who are not fitted to do well when at an advanced age they come\r\ninto positions of command and of great responsibility. But the desire\r\nof these men to be promoted to positions which they are not competent\r\nto fill should not weigh against the interest of the Navy and the\r\ncountry. At present our men, especially in the Navy, are kept far too\r\nlong in the junior grades, and then, at much too advanced an age, are\r\nput quickly through the senior grades, often not attaining to these\r\nsenior grades until they are too old to be of real use in them; and if\r\nthey are of real use, being put through them so quickly that little\r\nbenefit to the Navy comes from their having been in them at all.\r\n\r\nThe Navy has one great advantage over the Army in the fact that the\r\nofficers of high rank are actually trained in the continual performance\r\nof their duties; that is, in the management of the battle ships and\r\narmored cruisers gathered into fleets. This is not true of the army\r\nofficers, who rarely have corresponding chances to exercise command\r\nover troops under service conditions. The conduct of the Spanish war\r\nshowed the lamentable loss of life, the useless extravagance, and the\r\ninefficiency certain to result, if during peace the high officials of\r\nthe War and Navy Departments are praised and rewarded only if they save\r\nmoney at no matter what cost to the efficiency of the service, and if\r\nthe higher officers are given no chance whatever to exercise and\r\npractise command. For years prior to the Spanish war the Secretaries of\r\nWar were praised chiefly if they practised economy; which economy,\r\nespecially in connection with the quartermaster, commissary, and\r\nmedical departments, was directly responsible for most of the\r\nmismanagement that occurred in the war itself--and parenthetically be\r\nit observed that the very people who clamored for the misdirected\r\neconomy in the first place were foremost to denounce the mismanagement,\r\nloss, and suffering which were primarily due to this same misdirected\r\neconomy and to the lack of preparation it involved. There should soon\r\nbe an increase in the number of men for our coast defenses; these men\r\nshould be of the right type and properly trained; and there should\r\ntherefore be an increase of pay for certain skilled grades, especially\r\nin the coast artillery. Money should be appropriated to permit troops\r\nto be massed in body and exercised in maneuvers, particularly in\r\nmarching. Such exercise during the summer just past has been of\r\nincalculable benefit to the Army and should under no circumstances be\r\ndiscontinued. If on these practise marches and in these maneuvers\r\nelderly officers prove unable to bear the strain, they should be\r\nretired at once, for the fact is conclusive as to their unfitness for\r\nwar; that is, for the only purpose because of which they should be\r\nallowed to stay in the service. It is a real misfortune to have scores\r\nof small company or regimental posts scattered throughout the country;\r\nthe Army should be gathered in a few brigade or division posts; and the\r\ngenerals should be practised in handling the men in masses. Neglect to\r\nprovide for all of this means to incur the risk of future disaster and\r\ndisgrace.\r\n\r\nThe readiness and efficiency of both the Army and Navy in dealing with\r\nthe recent sudden crisis in Cuba illustrate afresh their value to the\r\nNation. This readiness and efficiency would have been very much less\r\nhad it not been for the existence of the General Staff in the Army and\r\nthe General Board in the Navy; both are essential to the proper\r\ndevelopment and use of our military forces afloat and ashore. The\r\ntroops that were sent to Cuba were handled flawlessly. It was the\r\nswiftest mobilization and dispatch of troops over sea ever accomplished\r\nby our Government. The expedition landed completely equipped and ready\r\nfor immediate service, several of its organizations hardly remaining in\r\nHavana over night before splitting up into detachments and going to\r\ntheir several posts, It was a fine demonstration of the value and\r\nefficiency of the General Staff. Similarly, it was owing in large part\r\nto the General Board that the Navy was able at the outset to meet the\r\nCuban crisis with such instant efficiency; ship after ship appearing on\r\nthe shortest notice at any threatened point, while the Marine Corps in\r\nparticular performed indispensable service. The Army and Navy War\r\nColleges are of incalculable value to the two services, and they\r\ncooperate with constantly increasing efficiency and importance.\r\n\r\nThe Congress has most wisely provided for a National Board for the\r\npromotion of rifle practise. Excellent results have already come from\r\nthis law, but it does not go far enough. Our Regular Army is so small\r\nthat in any great war we should have to trust mainly to volunteers; and\r\nin such event these volunteers should already know how to shoot; for if\r\na soldier has the fighting edge, and ability to take care of himself in\r\nthe open, his efficiency on the line of battle is almost directly\r\nProportionate to excellence in marksmanship. We should establish\r\nshooting galleries in all the large public and military schools, should\r\nmaintain national target ranges in different parts of the country, and\r\nshould in every way encourage the formation of rifle clubs throughout\r\nall parts of the land. The little Republic of Switzerland offers us an\r\nexcellent example in all matters connected with building up an\r\nefficient citizen soldiery.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nTheodore Roosevelt\r\nDecember 3, 1907\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nNo nation has greater resources than ours, and I think it can be\r\ntruthfully said that the citizens of no nation possess greater energy\r\nand industrial ability. In no nation are the fundamental business\r\nconditions sounder than in ours at this very moment; and it is foolish,\r\nwhen such is the case, for people to hoard money instead of keeping it\r\nin sound banks; for it is such hoarding that is the immediate occasion\r\nof money stringency. Moreover, as a rule, the business of our people is\r\nconducted with honesty and probity, and this applies alike to farms and\r\nfactories, to railroads and banks, to all our legitimate commercial\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\nIn any large body of men, however, there are certain to be some who are\r\ndishonest, and if the conditions are such that these men prosper or\r\ncommit their misdeeds with impunity, their example is a very evil thing\r\nfor the community. Where these men are business men of great sagacity\r\nand of temperament both unscrupulous and reckless, and where the\r\nconditions are such that they act without supervision or control and at\r\nfirst without effective check from public opinion, they delude many\r\ninnocent people into making investments or embarking in kinds of\r\nbusiness that are really unsound. When the misdeeds of these\r\nsuccessfully dishonest men are discovered, suffering comes not only\r\nupon them, but upon the innocent men whom they have misled. It is a\r\npainful awakening, whenever it occurs; and, naturally, when it does\r\noccur those who suffer are apt to forget that the longer it was\r\ndeferred the more painful it would be. In the effort to punish the\r\nguilty it is both wise and proper to endeavor so far as possible to\r\nminimize the distress of those who have been misled by the guilty. Yet\r\nit is not possible to refrain because of such distress from striving to\r\nput an end to the misdeeds that are the ultimate causes of the\r\nsuffering, and, as a means to this end, where possible to punish those\r\nresponsible for them. There may be honest differences of opinion as to\r\nmany governmental policies; but surely there can be no such differences\r\nas to the need of unflinching perseverance in the war against\r\nsuccessful dishonesty.\r\n\r\nIn my Message to the Congress on December 5, 1905, I said:\r\n\r\n\"If the folly of man mars the general well-being, then those who are\r\ninnocent of the folly will have to pay part of the penalty incurred by\r\nthose who are guilty of the folly. A panic brought on by the\r\nspeculative folly of part of the business community would hurt the\r\nwhole business community; but such stoppage of welfare, though it might\r\nbe severe, would not be lasting. In the long run, the one vital factor\r\nin the permanent prosperity of the country is the high individual\r\ncharacter of the average American worker, the average American citizen,\r\nno matter whether his work be mental or manual, whether he be farmer or\r\nwage-worker, business man or professional man.\r\n\r\n\"In our industrial and social system the interests of all men are so\r\nclosely intertwined that in the immense majority of cases a\r\nstraight-dealing man, who by his efficiency, by his ingenuity and\r\nindustry, benefits himself, must also benefit others. Normally, the man\r\nof great productive capacity who becomes rich by guiding the labor of\r\nmany other men does so by enabling them to produce more than they could\r\nproduce without his guidance; and both he and they share in the\r\nbenefit, which comes also to the public at large. The superficial fact\r\nthat the sharing may be unequal must never blind us to the underlying\r\nfact that there is this sharing, and that the benefit comes in some\r\ndegree to each man concerned.. Normally, the wageworker, the man of\r\nsmall means, and the average consumer, as well as the average producer,\r\nare all alike helped by making conditions such that the man of\r\nexceptional business ability receives an exceptional reward for his\r\nability Something can be done by legislation to help the general\r\nprosperity; but no such help of a permanently beneficial character can\r\nbe given to the less able and less fortunate save as the results of a\r\npolicy which shall inure to the advantage of all industrious and\r\nefficient people who act decently; and this is only another way of\r\nsaying that any benefit which comes to the less able and less fortunate\r\nmust of necessity come even more to the more able and more fortunate.\r\nIf, therefore, the less fortunate man is moved by envy of his more\r\nfortunate brother to strike at the conditions under which they have\r\nboth, though unequally, prospered, the result will assuredly be that\r\nwhile damage may come to the one struck at, it will visit with an even\r\nheavier load the one who strikes the blow. Taken as a whole, we must\r\nall go up or go down together.\r\n\r\n\"Yet, while not merely admitting, but insisting upon this, it is also\r\ntrue that where there is no governmental restraint or supervision some\r\nof the exceptional men use their energies, not in ways that are for the\r\ncommon good, but in ways which tell against this common good. The\r\nfortunes amassed through corporate organization are now so large, and\r\nvest such power in those that wield them, as to make it a matter of\r\nnecessity to give to the sovereign--that is, to the Government, which\r\nrepresents the people as a whole--some effective power of supervision\r\nover their corporate use. In order to insure a healthy social and\r\nindustrial life, every big corporation should be held responsible by,\r\nand be accountable to, some sovereign strong enough to control its\r\nconduct. I am in no sense hostile to corporations. This is an age of\r\ncombination, and any effort to prevent all combination will be not only\r\nuseless, but in the end vicious, because of the contempt for law which\r\nthe failure to enforce law inevitably produces. We should, moreover,\r\nrecognize in cordial and ample fashion the immense good effected by\r\ncorporate agencies in a country such as ours, and the wealth of\r\nintellect, energy, and fidelity devoted to their service, and therefore\r\nnormally to the service of the public, by their officers and directors.\r\nThe corporation has come to stay, just as the trade union has come to\r\nstay. Each can do and has done great good. Each should be favored so\r\nlong as it does good. But each should be sharply checked where it acts\r\nagainst law and justice.\r\n\r\n\"The makers of our National Constitution provided especially that the\r\nregulation of interstate commerce should come within the sphere of the\r\nGeneral Government. The arguments in favor of their taking this stand\r\nwere even then overwhelming. But they are far stronger to-day, in view\r\nof the enormous development of great business agencies, usually\r\ncorporate in form. Experience has shown conclusively that it is useless\r\nto try to get any adequate regulation and supervision of these great\r\ncorporations by State action. Such regulation and supervision can only\r\nbe effectively exercised by a sovereign whose jurisdiction is\r\ncoextensive with the field of work of the corporations--that is, by the\r\nNational Government. I believe that this regulation and supervision can\r\nbe obtained by the enactment of law by the Congress. Our steady aim\r\nshould be by legislation, cautiously and carefully undertaken, but\r\nresolutely persevered in, to assert the sovereignty of the National\r\nGovernment by affirmative action.\r\n\r\n\"This is only in form an innovation. In substance it is merely a\r\nrestoration; for from the earliest time such regulation of industrial\r\nactivities has been recognized in the action of the lawmaking bodies;\r\nand all that I propose is to meet the changed conditions in such manner\r\nas will prevent the Commonwealth abdicating the power it has always\r\npossessed, not only in this country, but also in England before and\r\nsince this country became a separate nation.\r\n\r\n\"It has been a misfortune that the National laws on this subject have\r\nhitherto been of a negative or prohibitive rather than an affirmative\r\nkind, and still more that they have in part sought to prohibit what\r\ncould not be effectively prohibited, and have in part in their\r\nprohibitions confounded what should be allowed and what should not be\r\nallowed. It is generally useless to try to prohibit all restraint on\r\ncompetition, whether this restraint be reasonable or unreasonable; and\r\nwhere it is not useless it is generally hurtful. The successful\r\nprosecution of one device to evade the law immediately develops another\r\ndevice to accomplish the same purpose. What is needed is not sweeping\r\nprohibition of every arrangement, good or bad, which may tend to\r\nrestrict competition, but such adequate supervision and regulation as\r\nwill prevent any restriction of competition from being to the detriment\r\nof the public, as well as such supervision and regulation as will\r\nprevent other abuses in no way connected with restriction of\r\ncompetition.\"\r\n\r\nI have called your attention in these quotations to what I have already\r\nsaid because I am satisfied that it is the duty of the National\r\nGovernment to embody in action the principles thus expressed.\r\n\r\nNo small part of the trouble that we have comes from carrying to an\r\nextreme the national virtue of self-reliance, of independence in\r\ninitiative and action. It is wise to conserve this virtue and to\r\nprovide for its fullest exercise, compatible with seeing that liberty\r\ndoes not become a liberty to wrong others. Unfortunately, this is the\r\nkind of liberty that the lack of all effective regulation inevitably\r\nbreeds. The founders of the Constitution provided that the National\r\nGovernment should have complete and sole control of interstate\r\ncommerce. There was then practically no interstate business save such\r\nas was conducted by water, and this the National Government at once\r\nproceeded to regulate in thoroughgoing and effective fashion.\r\nConditions have now so wholly changed that the interstate commerce by\r\nwater is insignificant compared with the amount that goes by land, and\r\nalmost all big business concerns are now engaged in interstate\r\ncommerce. As a result, it can be but partially and imperfectly\r\ncontrolled or regulated by the action of any one of the several States;\r\nsuch action inevitably tending to be either too drastic or else too\r\nlax, and in either case ineffective for purposes of justice. Only the\r\nNational Government can in thoroughgoing fashion exercise the needed\r\ncontrol. This does not mean that there should be any extension of\r\nFederal authority, for such authority already exists under the\r\nConstitution in amplest and most far-reaching form; but it does mean\r\nthat there should be an extension of Federal activity. This is not\r\nadvocating centralization. It is merely looking facts in the face, and\r\nrealizing that centralization in business has already come and can not\r\nbe avoided or undone, and that the public at large can only protect\r\nitself from certain evil effects of this business centralization by\r\nproviding better methods for the exercise of control through the\r\nauthority already centralized in the National Government by the\r\nConstitution itself. There must be no ball in the healthy constructive\r\ncourse of action which this Nation has elected to pursue, and has\r\nsteadily pursued, during the last six years, as shown both in the\r\nlegislation of the Congress and the administration of the law by the\r\nDepartment of Justice. The most vital need is in connection with the\r\nrailroads. As to these, in my judgment there should now be either a\r\nnational incorporation act or a law licensing railway companies to\r\nengage in interstate commerce upon certain conditions. The law should\r\nbe so framed as to give to the Interstate Commerce Commission power to\r\npass upon the future issue of securities, while ample means should be\r\nprovided to enable the Commission, whenever in its judgment it is\r\nnecessary, to make a physical valuation of any railroad. As I stated in\r\nmy Message to the Congress a year ago, railroads should be given power\r\nto enter into agreements, subject to these agreements being made public\r\nin minute detail and to the consent of the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission being first obtained. Until the National Government assumes\r\nproper control of interstate commerce, in the exercise of the authority\r\nit already possesses, it will be impossible either to give to or to get\r\nfrom the railroads full justice. The railroads and all other great\r\ncorporations will do well to recognize that this control must come; the\r\nonly question is as to what governmental body can most wisely exercise\r\nit. The courts will determine the limits within which the Federal\r\nauthority can exercise it, and there will still remain ample work\r\nwithin each State for the railway commission of that State; and the\r\nNational Interstate Commerce Commission will work in harmony with the\r\nseveral State commissions, each within its own province, to achieve the\r\ndesired end.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in my judgment there should be additional legislation looking\r\nto the proper control of the great business concerns engaged in\r\ninterstate business, this control to be exercised for their own benefit\r\nand prosperity no less than for the protection of investors and of the\r\ngeneral public. As I have repeatedly said in Messages to the Congress\r\nand elsewhere, experience has definitely shown not merely the unwisdom\r\nbut the futility of endeavoring to put a stop to all business\r\ncombinations. Modern industrial conditions are such that combination is\r\nnot only necessary but inevitable. It is so in the world of business\r\njust as it is so in the world of labor, and it is as idle to desire to\r\nput an end to all corporations, to all big combinations of capital, as\r\nto desire to put an end to combinations of labor. Corporation and labor\r\nunion alike have come to stay. Each if properly managed is a source of\r\ngood and not evil. Whenever in either there is evil, it should be\r\npromptly held to account; but it should receive hearty encouragement so\r\nlong as it is properly managed. It is profoundly immoral to put or keep\r\non the statute books a law, nominally in the interest of public\r\nmorality that really puts a premium upon public immorality, by\r\nundertaking to forbid honest men from doing what must be done under\r\nmodern business conditions, so that the law itself provides that its\r\nown infraction must be the condition precedent upon business success.\r\nTo aim at the accomplishment of too much usually means the\r\naccomplishment of too little, and often the doing of positive damage.\r\nIn my Message to the Congress a year ago, in speaking of the antitrust\r\nlaws, I said:\r\n\r\n\"The actual working of our laws has shown that the effort to prohibit\r\nall combination, good or bad, is noxious where it is not ineffective.\r\nCombination of capital, like combination of labor, is a necessary\r\nelement in our present industrial system. It is not possible completely\r\nto prevent it; and if it were possible, such complete prevention would\r\ndo damage to the body politic. What we need is not vainly to try to\r\nprevent all combination, but to secure such rigorous and adequate\r\ncontrol and supervision of the combinations as to prevent their\r\ninjuring the public, or existing in such forms as inevitably to\r\nthreaten injury. It is unfortunate that our present laws should forbid\r\nall combinations instead of sharply discriminating between those\r\ncombinations which do evil. Often railroads would like to combine for\r\nthe purpose of preventing a big shipper from maintaining improper\r\nadvantages at the expense of small shippers and of the general public.\r\nSuch a combination, instead of being forbidden by law, should be\r\nfavored. It is a public evil to have on the statute books a law\r\nincapable of full enforcement, because both judges and juries realize\r\nthat its full enforcement would destroy the business of the country;\r\nfor the result is to make decent men violators of the law against their\r\nwill, and to put a premium on the behavior of the willful wrongdoers.\r\nSuch a result in turn tends to throw the decent man and the willful\r\nwrongdoer into close association, and in the end to drag down the\r\nformer to the latter's level; for the man who becomes a lawbreaker in\r\none way unhappily tends to lose all respect for law and to be willing\r\nto break it in many ways. No more scathing condemnation could be\r\nvisited upon a law than is contained in the words of the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission when, in commenting upon the fact that the numerous\r\njoint traffic associations do technically violate the law, they say:\r\nThe decision of the United States Supreme Court in the Trans-Missouri\r\ncase and the Joint Traffic Association case has produced no practical\r\neffect upon the railway operations of the country. Such associations,\r\nin fact, exist now as they did before these decisions, and with the\r\nsame general effect. In justice to all parties, we ought probably to\r\nadd that it is difficult to see how our interstate railways could be\r\noperated with due regard to the interest of the shipper and the railway\r\nwithout concerted action of the kind afforded through these\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\n\"This means that the law as construed by the Supreme Court is such that\r\nthe business of the country can not be conducted without breaking it.\"\r\n\r\nAs I have elsewhere said:\r\n\r\n\"All this is substantially what I have said over and over again. Surely\r\nit ought not to be necessary to say that it in no shape or way\r\nrepresents any hostility to corporations as such. On the contrary, it\r\nmeans a frank recognition of the fact that combinations of capital,\r\nlike combinations of labor, are a natural result of modern conditions\r\nand of our National development. As far as in my ability lies my\r\nendeavor is and will be to prevent abuse of power by either and to\r\nfavor both so long as they do well. The aim of the National Government\r\nis quite as much to favor and protect honest corporations, honest\r\nbusiness men of wealth, as to bring to justice those individuals and\r\ncorporations representing dishonest methods. Most certainly there will\r\nbe no relaxation by the Government authorities in the effort to get at\r\nany great railroad wrecker--any man who by clever swindling devices\r\nrobs investors, oppresses wage-workers, and does injustice to the\r\ngeneral public. But any such move as this is in the interest of honest\r\nrailway operators, of honest corporations, and of those who, when they\r\ninvest their small savings in stocks and bonds, wish to be assured that\r\nthese will represent money honestly expended for legitimate business\r\npurposes. To confer upon the National Government the power for which I\r\nask would be a check upon overcapitalization and upon the clever\r\ngamblers who benefit by overcapitalization. But it alone would mean an\r\nincrease in the value, an increase in the safety of the stocks and\r\nbonds of law-abiding, honestly managed railroads, and would render it\r\nfar easier to market their securities. I believe in proper publicity.\r\nThere has been complaint of some of the investigations recently carried\r\non, but those who complain should put the blame where it belongs--upon\r\nthe misdeeds which are done in darkness and not upon the investigations\r\nwhich brought them to light. The Administration is responsible for\r\nturning on the light, but it is not responsible for what the light\r\nshowed. I ask for full power to be given the Federal Government,\r\nbecause no single State can by legislation effectually cope with these\r\npowerful corporations engaged in interstate commerce, and, while doing\r\nthem full justice, exact from them in return full justice to others.\r\nThe conditions of railroad activity, the conditions of our immense\r\ninterstate commerce, are such as to make the Central Government alone\r\ncompetent to exercise full supervision and control.\r\n\r\n\"The grave abuses in individual cases of railroad management in the\r\npast represent wrongs not merely to the general public, but, above all,\r\nwrongs to fair-dealing and honest corporations and men of wealth,\r\nbecause they excite a popular anger and distrust which from the very\r\nnature of the case tends to include in the sweep of its resentment good\r\nand bad alike. From the standpoint of the public I can not too\r\nearnestly say that as soon as the natural and proper resentment aroused\r\nby these abuses becomes indiscriminate and unthinking, it also becomes\r\nnot merely unwise and unfair, but calculated to defeat the very ends\r\nwhich those feeling it have in view. There has been plenty of dishonest\r\nwork by corporations in the past. There will not be the slightest\r\nlet-up in the effort to hunt down and punish every dishonest man. But\r\nthe bulk of our business is honestly done. In the natural indignation\r\nthe people feel over the dishonesty, it is essential that they should\r\nnot lose their heads and get drawn into an indiscriminate raid upon all\r\ncorporations, all people of wealth, whether they do well or ill. Out of\r\nany such wild movement good will not come, can not come, and never has\r\ncome. On the contrary, the surest way to invite reaction is to follow\r\nthe lead of either demagogue or visionary in a sweeping assault upon\r\nproperty values and upon public confidence, which would work\r\nincalculable damage in the business world and would produce such\r\ndistrust of the agitators that in the revulsion the distrust would\r\nextend to honest men who, in sincere and same fashion, are trying to\r\nremedy the evils.\"\r\n\r\nThe antitrust law should not be repealed; but it should be made both\r\nmore efficient and more in harmony with actual conditions. It should be\r\nso amended as to forbid only the kind of combination which does harm to\r\nthe general public, such amendment to be accompanied by, or to be an\r\nincident of, a grant of supervisory power to the Government over these\r\nbig concerns engaged in interstate business. This should be accompanied\r\nby provision for the compulsory publication of accounts and the\r\nsubjection of books and papers to the inspection of the Government\r\nofficials. A beginning has already been made for such supervision by\r\nthe establishment of the Bureau of Corporations.\r\n\r\nThe antitrust law should not prohibit combinations that do no injustice\r\nto the public, still less those the existence of which is on the whole\r\nof benefit to the public. But even if this feature of the law were\r\nabolished, there would remain as an equally objectionable feature the\r\ndifficulty and delay now incident to its enforcement. The Government\r\nmust now submit to irksome and repeated delay before obtaining a final\r\ndecision of the courts upon proceedings instituted, and even a\r\nfavorable decree may mean an empty victory. Moreover, to attempt to\r\ncontrol these corporations by lawsuits means to impose upon both the\r\nDepartment of Justice and the courts an impossible burden; it is not\r\nfeasible to carry on more than a limited number of such suits. Such a\r\nlaw to be really effective must of course be administered by an\r\nexecutive body, and not merely by means of lawsuits. The design should\r\nbe to prevent the abuses incident to the creation of unhealthy and\r\nimproper combinations, instead of waiting until they are in existence\r\nand then attempting to destroy them by civil or criminal proceedings.\r\n\r\nA combination should not be tolerated if it abuse the power acquired by\r\ncombination to the public detriment. No corporation or association of\r\nany kind should be permitted to engage in foreign or interstate\r\ncommerce that is formed for the purpose of, or whose operations create,\r\na monopoly or general control of the production, sale, or distribution\r\nof any one or more of the prime necessities of life or articles of\r\ngeneral use and necessity. Such combinations are against public policy;\r\nthey violate the common law; the doors of the courts are closed to\r\nthose who are parties to them, and I believe the Congress can close the\r\nchannels of interstate commerce against them for its protection. The\r\nlaw should make its prohibitions and permissions as clear and definite\r\nas possible, leaving the least possible room for arbitrary action, or\r\nallegation of such action, on the part of the Executive, or of\r\ndivergent interpretations by the courts. Among the points to be aimed\r\nat should be the prohibition of unhealthy competition, such as by\r\nrendering service at an actual loss for the purpose of crushing out\r\ncompetition, the prevention of inflation of capital, and the\r\nprohibition of a corporation's making exclusive trade with itself a\r\ncondition of having any trade with itself. Reasonable agreements\r\nbetween, or combinations of, corporations should be permitted, provided\r\nthey are submitted to and approved by some appropriate Government body.\r\n\r\nThe Congress has the power to charter corporations to engage in\r\ninterstate and foreign commerce, and a general law can be enacted under\r\nthe provisions of which existing corporations could take out Federal\r\ncharters and new Federal corporations could be created. An essential\r\nprovision of such a law should be a method of predetermining by some\r\nFederal board or commission whether the applicant for a Federal charter\r\nwas an association or combination within the restrictions of the\r\nFederal law. Provision should also be made for complete publicity in\r\nall matters affecting the public and complete protection to the\r\ninvesting public and the shareholders in the matter of issuing\r\ncorporate securities. If an incorporation law is not deemed advisable,\r\na license act for big interstate corporations might be enacted; or a\r\ncombination of the two might be tried. The supervision established\r\nmight be analogous to that now exercised over national banks. At least,\r\nthe antitrust act should be supplemented by specific prohibitions of\r\nthe methods which experience has shown have been of most service in\r\nenabling monopolistic combinations to crush out competition. The real\r\nowners of a corporation should be compelled to do business in their own\r\nname. The right to hold stock in other corporations should hereafter be\r\ndenied to interstate corporations, unless on approval by the Government\r\nofficials, and a prerequisite to such approval should be the listing\r\nwith the Government of all owners and stockholders, both by the\r\ncorporation owning such stock and by the corporation in which such\r\nstock is owned.\r\n\r\nTo confer upon the National Government, in connection with the\r\namendment I advocate in the antitrust law, power of supervision over\r\nbig business concerns engaged in interstate commerce, would benefit\r\nthem as it has benefited the national banks. In the recent business\r\ncrisis it is noteworthy that the institutions which failed were\r\ninstitutions which were not under the supervision and control of the\r\nNational Government. Those which were under National control stood the\r\ntest.\r\n\r\nNational control of the kind above advocated would be to the benefit of\r\nevery well-managed railway. From the standpoint of the public there is\r\nneed for additional tracks, additional terminals, and improvements in\r\nthe actual handling of the railroads, and all this as rapidly as\r\npossible. Ample, safe, and speedy transportation facilities are even\r\nmore necessary than cheap transportation. Therefore, there is need for\r\nthe investment of money which will provide for all these things while\r\nat the same time securing as far as is possible better wages and\r\nshorter hours for their employees. Therefore, while there must be just\r\nand reasonable regulation of rates, we should be the first to protest\r\nagainst any arbitrary and unthinking movement to cut them down without\r\nthe fullest and most careful consideration of all interests concerned\r\nand of the actual needs of the situation. Only a special body of men\r\nacting for the National Government under authority conferred upon it by\r\nthe Congress is competent to pass judgment on such a matter.\r\n\r\nThose who fear, from any reason, the extension of Federal activity will\r\ndo well to study the history not only of the national banking act but\r\nof the pure-food law, and notably the meat inspection law recently\r\nenacted. The pure-food law was opposed so violently that its passage\r\nwas delayed for a decade; yet it has worked unmixed and immediate good.\r\nThe meat inspection law was even more violently assailed; and the same\r\nmen who now denounce the attitude of the National Government in seeking\r\nto oversee and control the workings of interstate common carriers and\r\nbusiness concerns, then asserted that we were \"discrediting and ruining\r\na great American industry.\" Two years have not elapsed, and already it\r\nhas become evident that the great benefit the law confers upon the\r\npublic is accompanied by an equal benefit to the reputable packing\r\nestablishments. The latter are better off under the law than they were\r\nwithout it. The benefit to interstate common carriers and business\r\nconcerns from the legislation I advocate would be equally marked.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, in the passage of the pure-food law the action of the\r\nvarious State food and dairy commissioners showed in striking fashion\r\nhow much good for the whole people results from the hearty cooperation\r\nof the Federal and State officials in securing a given reform. It is\r\nprimarily to the action of these State commissioners that we owe the\r\nenactment of this law; for they aroused the people, first to demand the\r\nenactment and enforcement of State laws on the subject, and then the\r\nenactment of the Federal law, without which the State laws were largely\r\nineffective. There must be the closest cooperation between the National\r\nand State governments in administering these laws.\r\n\r\nIn my Message to the Congress a year ago I spoke as follows of the\r\ncurrency:\r\n\r\n\"I especially call your attention to the condition of our currency\r\nlaws. The national-bank act has ably served a great purpose in aiding\r\nthe enormous business development of the country, and within ten years\r\nthere has been an increase in circulation per capita from $21.41 to\r\n$33.08. For several years evidence has been accumulating that\r\nadditional legislation is needed. The recurrence of each crop season\r\nemphasizes the defects of the present laws. There must soon be a\r\nrevision of them, because to leave them as they are means to incur\r\nliability of business disaster. Since your body adjourned there has\r\nbeen a fluctuation in the interest on call money from 2 per cent to 30\r\npercent, and the fluctuation was even greater during the preceding six\r\nmonths. The Secretary of the Treasury had to step in and by wise action\r\nput a stop to the most violent period of oscillation. Even worse than\r\nsuch fluctuation is the advance in commercial rates and the uncertainty\r\nfelt in the sufficiency of credit even at high rates. All commercial\r\ninterests suffer during each crop period. Excessive rates for call\r\nmoney in New York attract money from the interior banks into the\r\nspeculative field. This depletes the fund that would otherwise be\r\navailable for commercial uses, and commercial borrowers are forced to\r\npay abnormal rates, so that each fall a tax, in the shape of increased\r\ninterest charges, is placed on the whole commerce of the country.\r\n\r\n\"The mere statement of these facts shows that our present system is\r\nseriously defective. There is need of a change. Unfortunately, however,\r\nmany of the proposed changes must be ruled from consideration because\r\nthey are complicated, are not easy of comprehension, and tend to\r\ndisturb existing rights and interests. We must also rule out any plan\r\nwhich would materially impair the value of the United States 2 per cent\r\nbonds now pledged to secure circulation, the issue of which was made\r\nunder conditions peculiarly creditable to the Treasury. I do not press\r\nany especial plan. Various plans have recently been proposed by expert\r\ncommittees of bankers. Among the plans which are possibly feasible and\r\nwhich certainly should receive your consideration is that repeatedly\r\nbrought to your attention by the present Secretary of the Treasury, the\r\nessential features of which have been approved by many prominent\r\nbankers and business men. According to this plan national banks should\r\nbe permitted to issue a specified proportion of their capital in notes\r\nof a given kind, the issue to be taxed at so high a rate as to drive\r\nthe notes back when not wanted in legitimate trade. This plan would not\r\npermit the issue of currency to give banks additional profits, but to\r\nmeet the emergency presented by times of stringency.\r\n\r\n\"I do not say that this is the right system. I only advance it to\r\nemphasize my belief that there is need for the adoption of some system\r\nwhich shall be automatic and open to all sound banks, so as to avoid\r\nall possibility of discrimination and favoritism. Such a plan would\r\ntend to prevent the spasms of high money and speculation which now\r\nobtain in the New York market; for at present there is too much\r\ncurrency at certain seasons of the year, and its accumulation at New\r\nYork tempts bankers to lend it at low rates for speculative purposes;\r\nwhereas at other times when the crops are being moved there is urgent\r\nneed for a large but temporary increase in the currency supply. It must\r\nnever be forgotten that this question concerns business men generally\r\nquite as much as bankers; especially is this true of stockmen, farmers,\r\nand business men in the West; for at present at certain seasons of the\r\nyear the difference in interest rates between the East and the West is\r\nfrom 6 to 10 per cent, whereas in Canada the corresponding difference\r\nis but 2 per cent. Any plan must, of course, guard the interests of\r\nwestern and southern bankers as carefully as it guards the interests of\r\nNew York or Chicago bankers, and must be drawn from the standpoints of\r\nthe farmer and the merchant no less than from the standpoints of the\r\ncity banker and the country banker.\"\r\n\r\nI again urge on the Congress the need of immediate attention to this\r\nmatter. We need a greater elasticity in our currency; provided, of\r\ncourse, that we recognize the even greater need of a safe and secure\r\ncurrency. There must always be the most rigid examination by the\r\nNational authorities. Provision should be made for an emergency\r\ncurrency. The emergency issue should, of course, be made with an\r\neffective guaranty, and upon conditions carefully prescribed by the\r\nGovernment. Such emergency issue must be based on adequate securities\r\napproved by the Government, and must be issued under a heavy tax. This\r\nwould permit currency being issued when the demand for it was urgent,\r\nwhile securing its requirement as the demand fell off. It is worth\r\ninvestigating to determine whether officers and directors of national\r\nbanks should ever be allowed to loan to themselves. Trust companies\r\nshould be subject to the same supervision as banks; legislation to this\r\neffect should be enacted for the District of Columbia and the\r\nTerritories.\r\n\r\nYet we must also remember that even the wisest legislation on the\r\nsubject can only accomplish a certain amount. No legislation can by any\r\npossibility guarantee the business community against the results of\r\nspeculative folly any more than it can guarantee an individual against\r\nthe results of his extravagance. When an individual mortgages his house\r\nto buy an automobile he invites disaster; and when wealthy men, or men\r\nwho pose as such, or are unscrupulously or foolishly eager to become\r\nsuch, indulge in reckless speculation--especially if it is accompanied\r\nby dishonesty--they jeopardize not only their own future but the future\r\nof all their innocent fellow-citizens, for the expose the whole\r\nbusiness community to panic and distress.\r\n\r\nThe income account of the Nation is in a most satisfactory condition.\r\nFor the six fiscal years ending with the 1st of July last, the total\r\nexpenditures and revenues of the National Government, exclusive of the\r\npostal revenues and expenditures, were, in round numbers, revenues,\r\n$3,465,000,0000, and expenditures, $3,275,000,000. The net excess of\r\nincome over expenditures, including in the latter the fifty millions\r\nexpended for the Panama Canal, was one hundred and ninety million\r\ndollars for the six years, an average of about thirty-one millions a\r\nyear. This represents an approximation between income and outgo which\r\nit would be hard to improve. The satisfactory working of the present\r\ntariff law has been chiefly responsible for this excellent showing.\r\nNevertheless, there is an evident and constantly growing feeling among\r\nour people that the time is rapidly approaching when our system of\r\nrevenue legislation must be revised.\r\n\r\nThis country is definitely committed to the protective system and any\r\neffort to uproot it could not but cause widespread industrial disaster.\r\nIn other words, the principle of the present tariff law could not with\r\nwisdom be changed. But in a country of such phenomenal growth as ours\r\nit is probably well that every dozen years or so the tariff laws should\r\nbe carefully scrutinized so as to see that no excessive or improper\r\nbenefits are conferred thereby, that proper revenue is provided, and\r\nthat our foreign trade is encouraged. There must always be as a minimum\r\na tariff which will not only allow for the collection of an ample\r\nrevenue but which will at least make good the difference in cost of\r\nproduction here and abroad; that is, the difference in the labor cost\r\nhere and abroad, for the well-being of the wage-worker must ever be a\r\ncardinal point of American policy. The question should be approached\r\npurely from a business standpoint; both the time and the manner of the\r\nchange being such as to arouse the minimum of agitation and disturbance\r\nin the business world, and to give the least play for selfish and\r\nfactional motives. The sole consideration should be to see that the sum\r\ntotal of changes represents the public good. This means that the\r\nsubject can not with wisdom be dealt with in the year preceding a\r\nPresidential election, because as a matter of fact experience has\r\nconclusively shown that at such a time it is impossible to get men to\r\ntreat it from the standpoint of the public good. In my judgment the\r\nwise time to deal with the matter is immediately after such election.\r\n\r\nWhen our tax laws are revised the question of an income tax and an\r\ninheritance tax should receive the careful attention of our\r\nlegislators. In my judgment both of these taxes should be part of our\r\nsystem of Federal taxation. I speak diffidently about the income tax\r\nbecause one scheme for an income tax was declared unconstitutional by\r\nthe Supreme Court; while in addition it is a difficult tax to\r\nadminister in its practical working, and great care would have to be\r\nexercised to see that it was not evaded by the very men whom it was\r\nmost desirable to have taxed, for if so evaded it would, of course, be\r\nworse than no tax at all; as the least desirable of all taxes is the\r\ntax which bears heavily upon the honest as compared with the dishonest\r\nman. Nevertheless, a graduated income tax of the proper type would be a\r\ndesirable feature of Federal taxation, and it is to be hoped that one\r\nmay be devised which the Supreme Court will declare constitutional. The\r\ninheritance tax, however, is both a far better method of taxation, and\r\nfar more important for the purpose of having the fortunes of the\r\ncountry bear in proportion to their increase in size a corresponding\r\nincrease and burden of taxation. The Government has the absolute right\r\nto decide as to the terms upon which a man shall receive a bequest or\r\ndevise from another, and this point in the devolution of property is\r\nespecially appropriate for the imposition of a tax. Laws imposing such\r\ntaxes have repeatedly been placed upon the National statute books and\r\nas repeatedly declared constitutional by the courts; and these laws\r\ncontained the progressive principle, that is, after a certain amount is\r\nreached the bequest or gift, in life or death, is increasingly burdened\r\nand the rate of taxation is increased in proportion to the remoteness\r\nof blood of the man receiving the bequest. These principles are\r\nrecognized already in the leading civilized nations of the world. In\r\nGreat Britain all the estates worth $5,000 or less are practically\r\nexempt from death duties, while the increase is such that when an\r\nestate exceeds five millions of dollars in value and passes to a\r\ndistant kinsman or stranger in blood the Government receives all told\r\nan amount equivalent to nearly a fifth of the whole estate. In France\r\nso much of an inheritance as exceeds $10,000,000 pays over a fifth to\r\nthe State if it passes to a distant relative. The German law is\r\nespecially interesting to us because it makes the inheritance tax an\r\nimperial measure while allotting to the individual States of the Empire\r\na portion of the proceeds and permitting them to impose taxes in\r\naddition to those imposed by the Imperial Government. Small\r\ninheritances are exempt, but the tax is so sharply progressive that\r\nwhen the inheritance is still not very large, provided it is not an\r\nagricultural or a forest land, it is taxed at the rate of 25 per cent\r\nif it goes to distant relatives. There is no reason why in the United\r\nStates the National Government should not impose inheritance taxes in\r\naddition to those imposed by the States, and when we last had an\r\ninheritance tax about one-half of the States levied such taxes\r\nconcurrently with the National Government, making a combined maximum\r\nrate, in some cases as high as 25 per cent. The French law has one\r\nfeature which is to be heartily commended. The progressive principle is\r\nso applied that each higher rate is imposed only on the excess above\r\nthe amount subject to the next lower rate; so that each increase of\r\nrate will apply only to a certain amount above a certain maximum. The\r\ntax should if possible be made to bear more heavily upon those residing\r\nwithout the country than within it. A heavy progressive tax upon a very\r\nlarge fortune is in no way such a tax upon thrift or industry as a like\r\nwould be on a small fortune. No advantage comes either to the country\r\nas a whole or to the individuals inheriting the money by permitting the\r\ntransmission in their entirety of the enormous fortunes which would be\r\naffected by such a tax; and as an incident to its function of revenue\r\nraising, such a tax would help to preserve a measurable equality of\r\nopportunity for the people of the generations growing to manhood. We\r\nhave not the slightest sympathy with that socialistic idea which would\r\ntry to put laziness, thriftlessness and inefficiency on a par with\r\nindustry, thrift and efficiency; which would strive to break up not\r\nmerely private property, but what is far more important, the home, the\r\nchief prop upon which our whole civilization stands. Such a theory, if\r\never adopted, would mean the ruin of the entire country--a ruin which\r\nwould bear heaviest upon the weakest, upon those least able to shift\r\nfor themselves. But proposals for legislation such as this herein\r\nadvocated are directly opposed to this class of socialistic theories.\r\nOur aim is to recognize what Lincoln pointed out: The fact that there\r\nare some respects in which men are obviously not equal; but also to\r\ninsist that there should be an equality of self-respect and of mutual\r\nrespect, an equality of rights before the law, and at least an\r\napproximate equality in the conditions under which each man obtains the\r\nchance to show the stuff that is in him when compared to his fellows.\r\n\r\nA few years ago there was loud complaint that the law could not be\r\ninvoked against wealthy offenders. There is no such complaint now. The\r\ncourse of the Department of Justice during the last few years has been\r\nsuch as to make it evident that no man stands above the law, that no\r\ncorporation is so wealthy that it can not be held to account. The\r\nDepartment of Justice has been as prompt to proceed against the\r\nwealthiest malefactor whose crime was one of greed and cunning as to\r\nproceed against the agitator who incites to brutal violence. Everything\r\nthat can be done under the existing law, and with the existing state of\r\npublic opinion, which so profoundly influences both the courts and\r\njuries, has been done. But the laws themselves need strengthening in\r\nmore than one important point; they should be made more definite, so\r\nthat no honest man can be led unwittingly to break them, and so that\r\nthe real wrongdoer can be readily punished.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there must be the public opinion back of the laws or the laws\r\nthemselves will be of no avail. At present, while the average juryman\r\nundoubtedly wishes to see trusts broken up, and is quite ready to fine\r\nthe corporation itself, he is very reluctant to find the facts proven\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt when it comes to sending to jail a member of\r\nthe business community for indulging in practices which are profoundly\r\nunhealthy, but which, unfortunately, the business community has grown\r\nto recognize as well-nigh normal. Both the present condition of the law\r\nand the present temper of juries render it a task of extreme difficulty\r\nto get at the real wrongdoer in any such case, especially by\r\nimprisonment. Yet it is from every standpoint far preferable to punish\r\nthe prime offender by imprisonment rather than to fine the corporation,\r\nwith the attendant damage to stockholders.\r\n\r\nThe two great evils in the execution of our criminal laws to-day are\r\nsentimentality and technicality. For the latter the remedy must come\r\nfrom the hands of the legislatures, the courts, and the lawyers. The\r\nother must depend for its cure upon the gradual growth of a sound\r\npublic opinion which shall insist that regard for the law and the\r\ndemands of reason shall control all other influences and emotions in\r\nthe jury box. Both of these evils must be removed or public discontent\r\nwith the criminal law will continue.\r\n\r\nInstances of abuse in the granting of injunctions in labor disputes\r\ncontinue to occur, and the resentment in the minds of those who feel\r\nthat their rights are being invaded and their liberty of action and of\r\nspeech unwarrantably restrained continues likewise to grow. Much of the\r\nattack on the use of the process of injunction is wholly without\r\nwarrant; but I am constrained to express the belief that for some of it\r\nthere is warrant. This question is becoming more and more one of prime\r\nimportance, and unless the courts will themselves deal with it in\r\neffective manner, it is certain ultimately to demand some form of\r\nlegislative action. It would be most unfortunate for our social welfare\r\nif we should permit many honest and law-abiding citizens to feel that\r\nthey had just cause for regarding our courts with hostility. I\r\nearnestly commend to the attention of the Congress this matter, so that\r\nsome way may be devised which will limit the abuse of injunctions and\r\nprotect those rights which from time to time it unwarrantably invades.\r\nMoreover, discontent is often expressed with the use of the process of\r\ninjunction by the courts, not only in labor disputes, but where State\r\nlaws are concerned. I refrain from discussion of this question as I am\r\ninformed that it will soon receive the consideration of the Supreme\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nThe Federal courts must of course decide ultimately what are the\r\nrespective spheres of State and Nation in connection with any law,\r\nState or National, and they must decide definitely and finally in\r\nmatters affecting individual citizens, not only as to the rights and\r\nwrongs of labor but as to the rights and wrongs of capital; and the\r\nNational Government must always see that the decision of the court is\r\nput into effect. The process of injunction is an essential adjunct of\r\nthe court's doing its work well; and as preventive measures are always\r\nbetter than remedial, the wise use of this process is from every\r\nstandpoint commendable. But where it is recklessly or unnecessarily\r\nused, the abuse should he censured, above all by the very men who are\r\nproperly anxious to prevent any effort to shear the courts of this\r\nnecessary power. The court's decision must be final; the protest is\r\nonly against the conduct of individual judges in needlessly\r\nanticipating such final decision, or in the tyrannical use of what is\r\nnominally a temporary injunction to accomplish what is in fact a\r\npermanent decision.\r\n\r\nThe loss of life and limb from railroad accidents in this country has\r\nbecome appalling. It is a subject of which the National Government\r\nshould take supervision. It might be well to begin by providing for a\r\nFederal inspection of interstate railroads somewhat along the lines of\r\nFederal inspection of steamboats, although not going so far; perhaps at\r\nfirst all that it would be necessary to have would be some officer\r\nwhose duty would be to investigate all accidents on interstate\r\nrailroads and report in detail the causes thereof. Such an officer\r\nshould make it his business to get into close touch with railroad\r\noperating men so as to become thoroughly familiar with every side of\r\nthe question, the idea being to work along the lines of the present\r\nsteamboat inspection law.\r\n\r\nThe National Government should be a model employer. It should demand\r\nthe highest quality of service from each of its employees and it should\r\ncare for all of them properly in return. Congress should adopt\r\nlegislation providing limited but definite compensation for accidents\r\nto all workmen within the scope of the Federal power, including\r\nemployees of navy yards and arsenals. In other words, a model\r\nemployers' liability act, far-reaching and thoroughgoing, should be\r\nenacted which should apply to all positions, public and private, over\r\nwhich the National Government has jurisdiction. The number of accidents\r\nto wage-workers, including those that are preventable and those that\r\nare not, has become appalling in the mechanical, manufacturing, and\r\ntransportation operations of the day. It works grim hardship to the\r\nordinary wage-worker and his family to have the effect of such an\r\naccident fall solely upon him; and, on the other hand, there are whole\r\nclasses of attorneys who exist only by inciting men who may or may not\r\nhave been wronged to undertake suits for negligence. As a matter of\r\nfact a suit for negligence is generally an inadequate remedy for the\r\nperson injured, while it often causes altogether disproportionate\r\nannoyance to the employer. The law should be made such that the payment\r\nfor accidents by the employer would be automatic instead of being a\r\nmatter for lawsuits. Workmen should receive certain and definite\r\ncompensation for all accidents in industry irrespective of negligence.\r\nThe employer is the agent of the public and on his own responsibility\r\nand for his own profit he serves the public. When he starts in motion\r\nagencies which create risks for others, he should take all the ordinary\r\nand extraordinary risks involved; and the risk he thus at the moment\r\nassumes will ultimately be assumed, as it ought to be, by the general\r\npublic. Only in this way can the shock of the accident be diffused,\r\ninstead of falling upon the man or woman least able to bear it, as is\r\nnow the case. The community at large should share the burdens as well\r\nas the benefits of industry. By the proposed law, employers would gain\r\na desirable certainty of obligation and get rid of litigation to\r\ndetermine it, while the workman and his family would be relieved from a\r\ncrushing load. With such a policy would come increased care, and\r\naccidents would be reduced in number. The National laws providing for\r\nemployers' liability on railroads engaged in interstate commerce and\r\nfor safety appliances, as well as for diminishing the hours any\r\nemployee of a railroad should be permitted to work, should all be\r\nstrengthened wherever in actual practice they have shown weakness; they\r\nshould be kept on the statute books in thoroughgoing form.\r\n\r\nThe constitutionality of the employers' liability act passed by the\r\npreceding Congress has been carried before the courts. In two\r\njurisdictions the law has been declared unconstitutional, and in three\r\njurisdictions its constitutionality has been affirmed. The question has\r\nbeen carried to the Supreme Court, the case has been heard by that\r\ntribunal, and a decision is expected at an early date. In the event\r\nthat the court should affirm the constitutionality of the act, I urge\r\nfurther legislation along the lines advocated in my Message to the\r\npreceding Congress. The practice of putting the entire burden of loss\r\nto life or limb upon the victim or the victim's family is a form of\r\nsocial injustice in which the United States stands in unenviable\r\nprominence. In both our Federal and State legislation we have, with few\r\nexceptions, scarcely gone farther than the repeal of the fellow-servant\r\nprinciple of the old law of liability, and in some of our States even\r\nthis slight modification of a completely outgrown principle has not yet\r\nbeen secured. The legislation of the rest of the industrial world\r\nstands out in striking contrast to our backwardness in this respect.\r\nSince 1895 practically every country of Europe, together with Great\r\nBritain, New Zealand, Australia, British Columbia, and the Cape of Good\r\nHope has enacted legislation embodying in one form or another the\r\ncomplete recognition of the principle which places upon the employer\r\nthe entire trade risk in the various lines of industry. I urge upon the\r\nCongress the enactment of a law which will at the same time bring\r\nFederal legislation up to the standard already established by all the\r\nEuropean countries, and which will serve as a stimulus to the various\r\nStates to perfect their legislation in this regard.\r\n\r\nThe Congress should consider the extension of the eight-hour law. The\r\nconstitutionality of the present law has recently been called into\r\nquestion, and the Supreme Court has decided that the existing\r\nlegislation is unquestionably within the powers of the Congress. The\r\nprinciple of the eight-hour day should as rapidly and as far as\r\npracticable be extended to the entire work carried on by the\r\nGovernment; and the present law should be amended to embrace contracts\r\non those public works which the present wording of the act has been\r\nconstrued to exclude. The general introduction of the eight-hour day\r\nshould be the goal toward which we should steadily tend, and the\r\nGovernment should set the example in this respect.\r\n\r\nStrikes and lockouts, with their attendant loss and suffering, continue\r\nto increase. For the five years ending December 31, 1905, the number of\r\nstrikes was greater than those in any previous ten years and was double\r\nthe number in the preceding five years. These figures indicate the\r\nincreasing need of providing some machinery to deal with this class of\r\ndisturbance in the interest alike of the employer, the employee, and\r\nthe general public. I renew my previous recommendation that the\r\nCongress favorably consider the matter of creating the machinery for\r\ncompulsory investigation of such industrial controversies as are of\r\nsufficient magnitude and of sufficient concern to the people of the\r\ncountry as a whole to warrant the Federal Government in taking action.\r\n\r\nThe need for some provision for such investigation was forcibly\r\nillustrated during the past summer. A strike of telegraph operators\r\nseriously interfered with telegraphic communication, causing great\r\ndamage to business interests and serious inconvenience to the general\r\npublic. Appeals were made to me from many parts of the country, from\r\ncity councils, from boards of trade, from chambers of commerce, and\r\nfrom labor organizations, urging that steps be taken to terminate the\r\nstrike. Everything that could with any propriety be done by a\r\nrepresentative of the Government was done, without avail, and for weeks\r\nthe public stood by and suffered without recourse of any kind. Had the\r\nmachinery existed and had there been authority for compulsory\r\ninvestigation of the dispute, the public would have been placed in\r\npossession of the merits of the controversy, and public opinion would\r\nprobably have brought about a prompt adjustment.\r\n\r\nEach successive step creating machinery for the adjustment of labor\r\ndifficulties must be taken with caution, but we should endeavor to make\r\nprogress in this direction.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the act of 1898 creating the chairman of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission and the Commissioner of Labor a board of\r\nmediation in controversies between interstate railroads and their\r\nemployees has, for the first time, been subjected to serious tests\r\nwithin the past year, and the wisdom of the experiment has been fully\r\ndemonstrated. The creation of a board for compulsory investigation in\r\ncases where mediation fails and arbitration is rejected is the next\r\nlogical step in a progressive program.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that for some time to come there will be a constant\r\nincrease absolutely, and perhaps relatively, of those among our\r\ncitizens who dwell in cities or towns of some size and who work for\r\nwages. This means that there will be an ever-increasing need to\r\nconsider the problems inseparable from a great industrial civilization.\r\nWhere an immense and complex business, especially in those branches\r\nrelating to manufacture and transportation, is transacted by a large\r\nnumber of capitalists who employ a very much larger number of\r\nwage-earners, the former tend more and more to combine into\r\ncorporations and the latter into unions. The relations of the\r\ncapitalist and wage-worker to one another, and of each to the general\r\npublic, are not always easy to adjust; and to put them and keep them on\r\na satisfactory basis is one of the most important and one of the most\r\ndelicate tasks before our whole civilization. Much of the work for the\r\naccomplishment of this end must be done by the individuals concerned\r\nthemselves, whether singly or in combination; and the one fundamental\r\nfact that must never be lost track of is that the character of the\r\naverage man, whether he be a man of means or a man who works with his\r\nhands, is the most important factor in solving the problem aright. But\r\nit is almost equally important to remember that without good laws it is\r\nalso impossible to reach the proper solution. It is idle to hold that\r\nwithout good laws evils such as child labor, as the over-working of\r\nwomen, as the failure to protect employees from loss of life or limb,\r\ncan be effectively reached, any more than the evils of rebates and\r\nstock-watering can be reached without good laws. To fail to stop these\r\npractices by legislation means to force honest men into them, because\r\notherwise the dishonest who surely will take advantage of them will\r\nhave everything their own way. If the States will correct these evils,\r\nwell and good; but the Nation must stand ready to aid them.\r\n\r\nNo question growing out of our rapid and complex industrial development\r\nis more important than that of the employment of women and children.\r\nThe presence of women in industry reacts with extreme directness upon\r\nthe character of the home and upon family life, and the conditions\r\nsurrounding the employment of children bear a vital relation to our\r\nfuture citizenship. Our legislation in those areas under the control of\r\nthe Congress is very much behind the legislation of our more\r\nprogressive States. A thorough and comprehensive measure should be\r\nadopted at this session of the Congress relating to the employment of\r\nwomen and children in the District of Columbia and the Territories. The\r\ninvestigation into the condition of women and children wage-earners\r\nrecently authorized and directed by the Congress is now being carried\r\non in the various States, and I recommend that the appropriation made\r\nlast year for beginning this work be renewed, in order that we may have\r\nthe thorough and comprehensive investigation which the subject demands.\r\nThe National Government has as an ultimate resort for control of child\r\nlabor the use of the interstate commerce clause to prevent the products\r\nof child labor from entering into interstate commerce. But before using\r\nthis it ought certainly to enact model laws on the subject for the\r\nTerritories under its own immediate control.\r\n\r\nThere is one fundamental proposition which can be laid down as regards\r\nall these matters, namely: While honesty by itself will not solve the\r\nproblem, yet the insistence upon honesty--not merely technical honesty,\r\nbut honesty in purpose and spirit--is an essential element in arriving\r\nat a right conclusion. Vice in its cruder and more archaic forms shocks\r\neverybody; but there is very urgent need that public opinion should be\r\njust as severe in condemnation of the vice which hides itself behind\r\nclass or professional loyalty, or which denies that it is vice if it\r\ncan escape conviction in the courts. The public and the representatives\r\nof the public, the high officials, whether on the bench or in executive\r\nor legislative positions, need to remember that often the most\r\ndangerous criminals, so far as the life of the Nation is concerned, are\r\nnot those who commit the crimes known to and condemned by the popular\r\nconscience for centuries, but those who commit crimes only rendered\r\npossible by the complex conditions of our modern industrial life. It\r\nmakes not a particle of difference whether these crimes are committed\r\nby a capitalist or by a laborer, by a leading banker or manufacturer or\r\nrailroad man, or by a leading representative of a labor union.\r\nSwindling in stocks, corrupting legislatures, making fortunes by the\r\ninflation of securities, by wrecking railroads, by destroying\r\ncompetitors through rebates--these forms of wrongdoing in the\r\ncapitalist, are far more infamous than any ordinary form of\r\nembezzlement or forgery; yet it is a matter of extreme difficulty to\r\nsecure the punishment of the man most guilty of them, most responsible\r\nfor them. The business man who condones such conduct stands on a level\r\nwith the labor man who deliberately supports a corrupt demagogue and\r\nagitator, whether head of a union or head of some municipality, because\r\nhe is said to have \"stood by the union.\" The members of the business\r\ncommunity, the educators, or clergymen, who condone and encourage the\r\nfirst kind of wrongdoing, are no more dangerous to the community, but\r\nare morally even worse, than the labor men who are guilty of the second\r\ntype of wrongdoing, because less is to be pardoned those who have no\r\nsuch excuse as is furnished either by ignorance or by dire need.  When\r\nthe Department of Agriculture was founded there was much sneering as to\r\nits usefulness. No Department of the Government, however, has more\r\nemphatically vindicated its usefulness, and none save the Post-Office\r\nDepartment comes so continually and intimately into touch with the\r\npeople. The two citizens whose welfare is in the aggregate most vital\r\nto the welfare of the Nation, and therefore to the welfare of all other\r\ncitizens, are the wage-worker who does manual labor and the tiller of\r\nthe soil, the farmer. There are, of course, kinds of labor where the\r\nwork must be purely mental, and there are other kinds of labor where,\r\nunder existing conditions, very little demand indeed is made upon the\r\nmind, though I am glad to say that the proportion of men engaged in\r\nthis kind of work is diminishing. But in any community with the solid,\r\nhealthy qualities which make up a really great nation the bulk of the\r\npeople should do work which calls for the exercise of both body and\r\nmind. Progress can not permanently exist in the abandonment of physical\r\nlabor, but in the development of physical labor, so that it shall\r\nrepresent more and more the work of the trained mind in the trained\r\nbody. Our school system is gravely defective in so far as it puts a\r\npremium upon mere literary training and tends therefore to train the\r\nboy away from the farm and the workshop. Nothing is more needed than\r\nthe best type of industrial school, the school for mechanical\r\nindustries in the city, the school for practically teaching agriculture\r\nin the country. The calling of the skilled tiller of the soil, the\r\ncalling of the skilled mechanic, should alike be recognized as\r\nprofessions, just as emphatically as the callings of lawyer, doctor,\r\nmerchant, or clerk. The schools recognize this fact and it should\r\nequally be recognized in popular opinion. The young man who has the\r\nfarsightedness and courage to recognize it and to get over the idea\r\nthat it makes a difference whether what he earns is called salary or\r\nwages, and who refuses to enter the crowded field of the so-called\r\nprofessions, and takes to constructive industry instead, is reasonably\r\nsure of an ample reward in earnings, in health, in opportunity to marry\r\nearly, and to establish a home with a fair amount of freedom from\r\nworry. It should be one of our prime objects to put both the farmer and\r\nthe mechanic on a higher plane of efficiency and reward, so as to\r\nincrease their effectiveness in the economic world, and therefore the\r\ndignity, the remuneration, and the power of their positions in the\r\nsocial world.\r\n\r\nNo growth of cities, no growth of wealth, can make up for any loss in\r\neither the number or the character of the farming population. We of the\r\nUnited States should realize this above almost all other peoples. We\r\nbegan our existence as a nation of farmers, and in every great crisis\r\nof the past a peculiar dependence has had to be placed upon the farming\r\npopulation; and this dependence has hitherto been justified. But it can\r\nnot be justified in the future if agriculture is permitted to sink in\r\nthe scale as compared with other employments. We can not afford to lose\r\nthat preeminently typical American, the farmer who owns his own\r\nmedium-sized farm. To have his place taken by either a class of small\r\npeasant proprietors, or by a class of great landlords with\r\ntenant-farmed estates would be a veritable calamity. The growth of our\r\ncities is a good thing but only in so far as it does not mean a growth\r\nat the expense of the country farmer. We must welcome the rise of\r\nphysical sciences in their application to agricultural practices, and\r\nwe must do all we can to render country conditions more easy and\r\npleasant. There are forces which now tend to bring about both these\r\nresults, but they are, as yet, in their infancy. The National\r\nGovernment through the Department of Agriculture should do all it can\r\nby joining with the State governments and with independent associations\r\nof farmers to encourage the growth in the open farming country of such\r\ninstitutional and social movements as will meet the demand of the best\r\ntype of farmers, both for the improvement of their farms and for the\r\nbetterment of the life itself. The Department of Agriculture has in\r\nmany places, perhaps especially in certain districts of the South,\r\naccomplished an extraordinary amount by cooperating with and teaching\r\nthe farmers through their associations, on their own soil, how to\r\nincrease their income by managing their farms better than they were\r\nhitherto managed. The farmer must not lose his independence, his\r\ninitiative, his rugged self-reliance, yet he must learn to work in the\r\nheartiest cooperation with his fellows, exactly as the business man has\r\nlearned to work; and he must prepare to use to constantly better\r\nadvantage the knowledge that can be obtained from agricultural\r\ncolleges, while he must insist upon a practical curriculum in the\r\nschools in which his children are taught. The Department of Agriculture\r\nand the Department of Commerce and Labor both deal with the fundamental\r\nneeds of our people in the production of raw material and its\r\nmanufacture and distribution, and, therefore, with the welfare of those\r\nwho produce it in the raw state, and of those who manufacture and\r\ndistribute it. The Department of Commerce and Labor has but recently\r\nbeen founded but has already justified its existence; while the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture yields to no other in the Government in the\r\npractical benefits which it produces in proportion to the public money\r\nexpended. It must continue in the future to deal with growing crops as\r\nit has dealt in the past, but it must still further extend its field of\r\nusefulness hereafter by dealing with live men, through a far-reaching\r\nstudy and treatment of the problems of farm life alike from the\r\nindustrial and economic and social standpoint. Farmers must cooperate\r\nwith one another and with the Government, and the Government can best\r\ngive its aid through associations of farmers, so as to deliver to the\r\nfarmer the large body of agricultural knowledge which has been\r\naccumulated by the National and State governments and by the\r\nagricultural colleges and schools.\r\n\r\nThe grain producing industry of the country, one of the most important\r\nin the United States, deserves special consideration at the hands of\r\nthe Congress. Our grain is sold almost exclusively by grades. To secure\r\nsatisfactory results in our home markets and to facilitate our trade\r\nabroad, these grades should approximate the highest degree of\r\nuniformity and certainty. The present diverse methods of inspection and\r\ngrading throughout the country under different laws and boards, result\r\nin confusion and lack of uniformity, destroying that confidence which\r\nis necessary for healthful trade. Complaints against the present\r\nmethods have continued for years and they are growing in volume and\r\nintensity, not only in this country but abroad. I therefore suggest to\r\nthe Congress the advisability of a National system of inspection and\r\ngrading of grain entering into interstate and foreign commerce as a\r\nremedy for the present evils.\r\n\r\nThe conservation of our natural resources and their proper use\r\nconstitute the fundamental problem which underlies almost every other\r\nproblem of our National life. We must maintain for our civilization the\r\nadequate material basis without which that civilization can not exist.\r\nWe must show foresight, we must look ahead. As a nation we not only\r\nenjoy a wonderful measure of present prosperity but if this prosperity\r\nis used aright it is an earnest of future success such as no other\r\nnation will have. The reward of foresight for this Nation is great and\r\neasily foretold. But there must be the look ahead, there must be a\r\nrealization of the fact that to waste, to destroy, our natural\r\nresources, to skin and exhaust the land instead of using it so as to\r\nincrease its usefulness, will result in undermining in the days of our\r\nchildren the very prosperity which we ought by right to hand down to\r\nthem amplified and developed. For the last few years, through several\r\nagencies, the Government has been endeavoring to get our people to look\r\nahead and to substitute a planned and orderly development of our\r\nresources in place of a haphazard striving for immediate profit. Our\r\ngreat river systems should be developed as National water highways, the\r\nMississippi, with its tributaries, standing first in importance, and\r\nthe Columbia second, although there are many others of importance on\r\nthe Pacific, the Atlantic and the Gulf slopes. The National Government\r\nshould undertake this work, and I hope a beginning will be made in the\r\npresent Congress; and the greatest of all our rivers, the Mississippi,\r\nshould receive especial attention. From the Great Lakes to the mouth of\r\nthe Mississippi there should be a deep waterway, with deep waterways\r\nleading from it to the East and the West. Such a waterway would\r\npractically mean the extension of our coast line into the very heart of\r\nour country. It would be of incalculable benefit to our people. If\r\nbegun at once it can be carried through in time appreciably to relieve\r\nthe congestion of our great freight-carrying lines of railroads. The\r\nwork should be systematically and continuously carried forward in\r\naccordance with some well-conceived plan. The main streams should be\r\nimproved to the highest point of efficiency before the improvement of\r\nthe branches is attempted; and the work should be kept free from every\r\nfaint of recklessness or jobbery. The inland waterways which lie just\r\nback of the whole eastern and southern coasts should likewise be\r\ndeveloped. Moreover, the development of our waterways involves many\r\nother important water problems, all of which should be considered as\r\npart of the same general scheme. The Government dams should be used to\r\nproduce hundreds of thousands of horsepower as an incident to improving\r\nnavigation; for the annual value of the unused water-power of the\r\nUnited States perhaps exceeds the annual value of the products of all\r\nour mines. As an incident to creating the deep waterways down the\r\nMississippi, the Government should build along its whole lower length\r\nlevees which taken together with the control of the headwaters, will at\r\nonce and forever put a complete stop to all threat of floods in the\r\nimmensely fertile Delta region. The territory lying adjacent to the\r\nMississippi along its lower course will thereby become one of the most\r\nprosperous and populous, as it already is one of the most fertile,\r\nfarming regions in all the world. I have appointed an Inland Waterways\r\nCommission to study and outline a comprehensive scheme of development\r\nalong all the lines indicated. Later I shall lay its report before the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIrrigation should be far more extensively developed than at present,\r\nnot only in the States of the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains, but\r\nin many others, as, for instance, in large portions of the South\r\nAtlantic and Gulf States, where it should go hand in hand with the\r\nreclamation of swamp land. The Federal Government should seriously\r\ndevote itself to this task, realizing that utilization of waterways and\r\nwater-power, forestry, irrigation, and the reclamation of lands\r\nthreatened with overflow, are all interdependent parts of the same\r\nproblem. The work of the Reclamation Service in developing the larger\r\nopportunities of the western half of our country for irrigation is more\r\nimportant than almost any other movement. The constant purpose of the\r\nGovernment in connection with the Reclamation Service has been to use\r\nthe water resources of the public lands for the ultimate greatest good\r\nof the greatest number; in other words, to put upon the land permanent\r\nhome-makers, to use and develop it for themselves and for their\r\nchildren and children's children. There has been, of course, opposition\r\nto this work; opposition from some interested men who desire to exhaust\r\nthe land for their own immediate profit without regard to the welfare\r\nof the next generation, and opposition from honest and well-meaning men\r\nwho did not fully understand the subject or who did not look far enough\r\nahead. This opposition is, I think, dying away, and our people are\r\nunderstanding that it would be utterly wrong to allow a few individuals\r\nto exhaust for their own temporary personal profit the resources which\r\nought to be developed through use so as to be conserved for the\r\npermanent common advantage of the people as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe effort of the Government to deal with the public land has been\r\nbased upon the same principle as that of the Reclamation Service. The\r\nland law system which was designed to meet the needs of the fertile and\r\nwell-watered regions of the Middle West has largely broken down when\r\napplied to the dryer regions of the Great Plains, the mountains, and\r\nmuch of the Pacific slope, where a farm of 160 acres is inadequate for\r\nself-support. In these regions the system lent itself to fraud, and\r\nmuch land passed out of the hands of the Government without passing\r\ninto the hands of the home-maker. The Department of the Interior and\r\nthe Department of Justice joined in prosecuting the offenders against\r\nthe law; and they have accomplished much, while where the\r\nadministration of the law has been defective it has been changed. But\r\nthe laws themselves are defective. Three years ago a public lands\r\ncommission was appointed to scrutinize the law, and defects, and\r\nrecommend a remedy. Their examination specifically showed the existence\r\nof great fraud upon the public domain, and their recommendations for\r\nchanges in the law were made with the design of conserving the natural\r\nresources of every part of the public lands by putting it to its best\r\nuse. Especial attention was called to the prevention of settlement by\r\nthe passage of great areas of public land into the hands of a few men,\r\nand to the enormous waste caused by unrestricted grazing upon the open\r\nrange. The recommendations of the Public Lands Commission are sound,\r\nfor they are especially in the interest of the actual homemaker; and\r\nwhere the small home-maker can not at present utilize the land they\r\nprovide that the Government shall keep control of it so that it may not\r\nbe monopolized by a few men. The Congress has not yet acted upon these\r\nrecommendations; but they are so just and proper, so essential to our\r\nNational welfare, that I feel confident, if the Congress will take time\r\nto consider them, that they will ultimately be adopted.\r\n\r\nSome such legislation as that proposed is essential in order to\r\npreserve the great stretches of public grazing land which are unfit for\r\ncultivation under present methods and are valuable only for the forage\r\nwhich they supply. These stretches amount in all to some 300,000,000\r\nacres, and are open to the free grazing of cattle, sheep, horses and\r\ngoats, without restriction. Such a system, or lack of system, means\r\nthat the range is not so much used as wasted by abuse. As the West\r\nsettles the range becomes more and more over-grazed. Much of it can not\r\nbe used to advantage unless it is fenced, for fencing is the only way\r\nby which to keep in check the owners of nomad flocks which roam hither\r\nand thither, utterly destroying the pastures and leaving a waste behind\r\nso that their presence is incompatible with the presence of\r\nhome-makers. The existing fences are all illegal. Some of them\r\nrepresent the improper exclusion of actual settlers, actual\r\nhome-makers, from territory which is usurped by great cattle companies.\r\nSome of them represent what is in itself a proper effort to use the\r\nrange for those upon the land, and to prevent its use by nomadic\r\noutsiders. All these fences, those that are hurtful and those that are\r\nbeneficial, are alike illegal and must come down. But it is an outrage\r\nthat the law should necessitate such action on the part of the\r\nAdministration. The unlawful fencing of public lands for private\r\ngrazing must be stopped, but the necessity which occasioned it must be\r\nprovided for. The Federal Government should have control of the range,\r\nwhether by permit or lease, as local necessities may determine. Such\r\ncontrol could secure the great benefit of legitimate fencing, while at\r\nthe same time securing and promoting the settlement of the country. In\r\nsome places it may be that the tracts of range adjacent to the\r\nhomesteads of actual settlers should be allotted to them severally or\r\nin common for the summer grazing of their stock. Elsewhere it may be\r\nthat a lease system would serve the purpose; the leases to be temporary\r\nand subject to the rights of settlement, and the amount charged being\r\nlarge enough merely to permit of the efficient and beneficial control\r\nof the range by the Government, and of the payment to the county of the\r\nequivalent of what it would otherwise receive in taxes. The destruction\r\nof the public range will continue until some such laws as these are\r\nenacted. Fully to prevent the fraud in the public lands which, through\r\nthe joint action of the Interior Department and the Department of\r\nJustice, we have been endeavoring to prevent, there must be further\r\nlegislation, and especially a sufficient appropriation to permit the\r\nDepartment of the Interior to examine certain classes of entries on the\r\nground before they pass into private ownership. The Government should\r\npart with its title only to the actual home-maker, not to the\r\nprofit-maker who does not care to make a home. Our prime object is to\r\nsecure the rights and guard the interests of the small ranchman, the\r\nman who plows and pitches hay for himself. It is this small ranchman,\r\nthis actual settler and homemaker, who in the long run is most hurt by\r\npermitting thefts of the public land in whatever form.\r\n\r\nOptimism is a good characteristic, but if carried to an excess it\r\nbecomes foolishness. We are prone to speak of the resources of this\r\ncountry as inexhaustible; this is not so. The mineral wealth of the\r\ncountry, the coal, iron, oil, gas, and the like, does not reproduce\r\nitself, and therefore is certain to be exhausted ultimately; and\r\nwastefulness in dealing with it to-day means that our descendants will\r\nfeel the exhaustion a generation or two before they otherwise would.\r\nBut there are certain other forms of waste which could be entirely\r\nstopped--the waste of soil by washing, for instance, which is among the\r\nmost dangerous of all wastes now in progress in the United States, is\r\neasily preventable, so that this present enormous loss of fertility is\r\nentirely unnecessary. The preservation or replacement of the forests is\r\none of the most important means of preventing this loss. We have made a\r\nbeginning in forest preservation, but it is only a beginning. At\r\npresent lumbering is the fourth greatest industry in the United States;\r\nand yet, so rapid has been the rate of exhaustion of timber in the\r\nUnited States in the past, and so rapidly is the remainder being\r\nexhausted, that the country is unquestionably on the verge of a timber\r\nfamine which will be felt in every household in the land. There has\r\nalready been a rise in the price of lumber, but there is certain to be\r\na more rapid and heavier rise in the future. The present annual\r\nconsumption of lumber is certainly three times as great as the annual\r\ngrowth; and if the consumption and growth continue unchanged,\r\npractically all our lumber will be exhausted in another generation,\r\nwhile long before the limit to complete exhaustion is reached the\r\ngrowing scarcity will make itself felt in many blighting ways upon our\r\nNational welfare. About 20 per cent of our forested territory is now\r\nreserved in National forests; but these do not include the most\r\nvaluable timber lauds, and in any event the proportion is too small to\r\nexpect that the reserves can accomplish more than a mitigation of the\r\ntrouble which is ahead for the nation. Far more drastic action is\r\nneeded. Forests can be lumbered so as to give to the public the full\r\nuse of their mercantile timber without the slightest detriment to the\r\nforest, any more than it is a detriment to a farm to furnish a harvest;\r\nso that there is no parallel between forests and mines, which can only\r\nbe completely used by exhaustion. But forests, if used as all our\r\nforests have been used in the past and as most of them are still used,\r\nwill be either wholly destroyed, or so damaged that many decades have\r\nto pass before effective use can be made of them again. All these facts\r\nare so obvious that it is extraordinary that it should be necessary to\r\nrepeat them. Every business man in the land, every writer in the\r\nnewspapers, every man or woman of an ordinary school education, ought\r\nto be able to see that immense quantities of timber are used in the\r\ncountry, that the forests which supply this timber are rapidly being\r\nexhausted, and that, if no change takes place, exhaustion will come\r\ncomparatively soon, and that the effects of it will be felt severely in\r\nthe every-day life of our people. Surely, when these facts are so\r\nobvious, there should be no delay in taking preventive measures. Yet we\r\nseem as a nation to be willing to proceed in this matter with\r\nhappy-go-lucky indifference even to the immediate future. It is this\r\nattitude which permits the self-interest of a very few persons to weigh\r\nfor more than the ultimate interest of all our people. There are\r\npersons who find it to their immense pecuniary benefit to destroy the\r\nforests by lumbering. They are to be blamed for thus sacrificing the\r\nfuture of the Nation as a whole to their own self-interest of the\r\nmoment; but heavier blame attaches to the people at large for\r\npermitting such action, whether in the White Mountains, in the southern\r\nAlleghenies, or in the Rockies and Sierras. A big lumbering company,\r\nimpatient for immediate returns and not caring to look far enough\r\nahead, will often deliberately destroy all the good timber in a region,\r\nhoping afterwards to move on to some new country. The shiftless man of\r\nsmall means, who does not care to become an actual home-maker but would\r\nlike immediate profit, will find it to his advantage to take up timber\r\nland simply to turn it over to such a big company, and leave it\r\nvalueless for future settlers. A big mine owner, anxious only to\r\ndevelop his mine at the moment, will care only to cut all the timber\r\nthat he wishes without regard to the future--probably net looking ahead\r\nto the condition of the country when the forests are exhausted, any\r\nmore than he does to the condition when the mine is worked out. I do\r\nnot blame these men nearly as much as I blame the supine public\r\nopinion, the indifferent public opinion, which permits their action to\r\ngo unchecked. Of course to check the waste of timber means that there\r\nmust be on the part of the public the acceptance of a temporary\r\nrestriction in the lavish use of the timber, in order to prevent the\r\ntotal loss of this use in the future. There are plenty of men in public\r\nand private life who actually advocate the continuance of the present\r\nsystem of unchecked and wasteful extravagance, using as an argument the\r\nfact that to check it will of course mean interference with the ease\r\nand comfort of certain people who now get lumber at less cost than they\r\nought to pay, at the expense of the future generations. Some of these\r\npersons actually demand that the present forest reserves be thrown open\r\nto destruction, because, forsooth, they think that thereby the price of\r\nlumber could be put down again for two or three or more years. Their\r\nattitude is precisely like that of an agitator protesting against the\r\noutlay of money by farmers on manure and in taking care of their farms\r\ngenerally. Undoubtedly, if the average farmer were content absolutely\r\nto ruin his farm, he could for two or three years avoid spending any\r\nmoney on it, and yet make a good deal of money out of it. But only a\r\nsavage would, in his private affairs, show such reckless disregard of\r\nthe future; yet it is precisely this reckless disregard of the future\r\nwhich the opponents of the forestry system are now endeavoring to get\r\nthe people of the United States to show. The only trouble with the\r\nmovement for the preservation of our forests is that it has not gone\r\nnearly far enough, and was not begun soon enough. It is a most\r\nfortunate thing, however, that we began it when we did. We should\r\nacquire in the Appalachian and White Mountain regions all the forest\r\nlands that it is possible to acquire for the use of the Nation. These\r\nlands, because they form a National asset, are as emphatically national\r\nas the rivers which they feed, and which flow through so many States\r\nbefore they reach the ocean.\r\n\r\nThere should be no tariff on any forest product grown in this country;\r\nand, in especial, there should be no tariff on wood pulp; due notice of\r\nthe change being of course given to those engaged in the business so as\r\nto enable them to adjust themselves to the new conditions. The repeal\r\nof the duty on wood pulp should if possible be accompanied by an\r\nagreement with Canada that there shall be no export duty on Canadian\r\npulp wood.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern United States the mineral fuels have already passed into\r\nthe hands of large private owners, and those of the West are rapidly\r\nfollowing. It is obvious that these fuels should be conserved and not\r\nwasted, and it would be well to protect the people against unjust and\r\nextortionate prices, so far as that can still be done. What has been\r\naccomplished in the great oil fields of the Indian Territory by the\r\naction of the Administration, offers a striking example of the good\r\nresults of such a policy. In my judgment the Government should have the\r\nright to keep the fee of the coal, oil, and gas fields in its own\r\npossession and to lease the rights to develop them under proper\r\nregulations; or else, if the Congress will not adopt this method, the\r\ncoal deposits should be sold under limitations, to conserve them as\r\npublic utilities, the right to mine coal being separated from the title\r\nto the soil. The regulations should permit coal lands to be worked in\r\nsufficient quantity by the several corporations. The present\r\nlimitations have been absurd, excessive, and serve no useful purpose,\r\nand often render it necessary that there should be either fraud or\r\nclose abandonment of the work of getting out the coal.\r\n\r\nWork on the Panama Canal is proceeding in a highly satisfactory manner.\r\nIn March last, John F. Stevens, chairman of the Commission and chief\r\nengineer, resigned, and the Commission was reorganized and constituted\r\nas follows: Lieut. Col. George W. Goethals, Corps. of Engineers, U. S.\r\nArmy, chairman and chief engineer; Maj. D. D. Gall-lard, Corps of\r\nEngineers, U. S. Army; Maj. William L. Sibert, Corps of Engineers, U.\r\nS. Army; Civil Engineer H. H. Rousseau, U. S. Navy; Mr. J. C. S.\r\nBlackburn; Col. W. C. Gorgas, U. S. Army, and Mr. Jackson Smith,\r\nCommissioners. This change of authority and direction went into effect\r\non April 1, without causing a perceptible check to the progress of the\r\nwork. In March the total excavation in the Culebra Cut, where effort\r\nwas chiefly concentrated, was 815,270 cubic yards. In April this was\r\nincreased to 879,527 cubic yards. There was a considerable decrease in\r\nthe output for May and June owing partly to the advent of the rainy\r\nseason and partly to temporary trouble with the steam shovel men over\r\nthe question of wages. This trouble was settled satisfactorily to all\r\nparties and in July the total excavation advanced materially and in\r\nAugust the grand total from all points in the canal prism by steam\r\nshovels and dredges exceeded all previous United States records,\r\nreaching 1,274,404 cubic yards. In September this record was eclipsed\r\nand a total of 1,517,412 cubic yards was removed. Of this amount\r\n1,481,307 cubic yards were from the canal prism and 36,105 cubic yards\r\nwere from accessory works. These results were achieved in the rainy\r\nseason with a rainfall in August of 11.89 inches and in September of\r\n11.65 inches. Finally, in October, the record was again eclipsed, the\r\ntotal excavation being 1,868,729 cubic yards; a truly extraordinary\r\nrecord, especially in view of the heavy rainfall, which was 17.1\r\ninches. In fact, experience during the last two rainy seasons\r\ndemonstrates that the rains are a less serious obstacle to progress\r\nthan has hitherto been supposed.\r\n\r\nWork on the locks and dams at Gatun, which began actively in March\r\nlast, has advanced so far that it is thought that masonry work on the\r\nlocks can be begun within fifteen months. In order to remove all doubt\r\nas to the satisfactory character of the foundations for the locks of\r\nthe Canal, the Secretary of War requested three eminent civil\r\nengineers, of special experience in such construction, Alfred Noble,\r\nFrederic P. Stearns and John R. Freeman, to visit the Isthmus and make\r\nthorough personal investigations of the sites. These gentlemen went to\r\nthe Isthmus in April and by means of test pits which had been dug for\r\nthe purpose, they inspected the proposed foundations, and also examined\r\nthe borings that had been made. In their report to the Secretary of\r\nWar, under date of May 2, 1907, they said: \"We found that all of the\r\nlocks, of the dimensions now proposed, will rest upon rock of such\r\ncharacter that it will furnish a safe and stable foundation.\"\r\nSubsequent new borings, conducted by the present Commission, have fully\r\nconfirmed this verdict. They show that the locks will rest on rock for\r\ntheir entire length. The cross section of the dam and method of\r\nconstruction will be such as to insure against any slip or sloughing\r\noff. Similar examination of the foundations of the locks and dams on\r\nthe Pacific side are in progress. I believe that the locks should be\r\nmade of a width of 120 feet.\r\n\r\nLast winter bids were requested and received for doing the work of\r\ncanal construction by contract. None of them was found to be\r\nsatisfactory and all were rejected. It is the unanimous opinion of the\r\npresent Commission that the work can be done better, more cheaply, and\r\nmore quickly by the Government than by private contractors. Fully 80\r\nper cent of the entire plant needed for construction has been purchased\r\nor contracted for; machine shops have been erected and equipped for\r\nmaking all needed repairs to the plant; many thousands of employees\r\nhave been secured; an effective organization has been perfected; a\r\nrecruiting system is in operation which is capable of furnishing more\r\nlabor than can be used advantageously; employees are well sheltered and\r\nwell fed; salaries paid are satisfactory, and the work is not only\r\ngoing forward smoothly, but it is producing results far in advance of\r\nthe most sanguine anticipations. Under these favorable conditions, a\r\nchange in the method of prosecuting the work would be unwise and\r\nunjustifiable, for it would inevitably disorganize existing conditions,\r\ncheck progress, and increase the cost and lengthen the time of\r\ncompleting the Canal.\r\n\r\nThe chief engineer and all his professional associates are firmly\r\nconvinced that the 85 feet level lock canal which they are constructing\r\nis the best that could be desired. Some of them had doubts on this\r\npoint when they went to the Isthmus. As the plans have developed under\r\ntheir direction their doubts have been dispelled. While they may decide\r\nupon changes in detail as construction advances they are in hearty\r\naccord in approving the general plan. They believe that it provides a\r\ncanal not only adequate to all demands that will be made upon it but\r\nsuperior in every way to a sea level canal. I concur in this belief.\r\n\r\nI commend to the favorable consideration of the Congress a postal\r\nsavings bank system, as recommended by the Postmaster-General. The\r\nprimary object is to encourage among our people economy and thrift and\r\nby the use of postal savings banks to give them an opportunity to\r\nhusband their resources, particularly those who have not the facilities\r\nat hand for depositing their money in savings banks. Viewed, however,\r\nfrom the experience of the past few weeks, it is evident that the\r\nadvantages of such an institution are till more far-reaching. Timid\r\ndepositors have withdrawn their savings for the time being from\r\nnational banks, trust companies, and savings banks; individuals have\r\nhoarded their cash and the workingmen their earnings; all of which\r\nmoney has been withheld and kept in hiding or in safe deposit box to\r\nthe detriment of prosperity. Through the agency of the postal savings\r\nbanks such money would be restored to the channels of trade, to the\r\nmutual benefit of capital and labor.\r\n\r\nI further commend to the Congress the consideration of the\r\nPostmaster-General's recommendation for an extension of the parcel\r\npost, especially on the rural routes. There are now 38,215 rural\r\nroutes, serving nearly 15,000,000 people who do not have the advantages\r\nof the inhabitants of cities in obtaining their supplies. These\r\nrecommendations have been drawn up to benefit the farmer and the\r\ncountry storekeeper; otherwise, I should not favor them, for I believe\r\nthat it is good policy for our Government to do everything possible to\r\naid the small town and the country district. It is desirable that the\r\ncountry merchant should not be crushed out.\r\n\r\nThe fourth-class postmasters' convention has passed a very strong\r\nresolution in favor of placing the fourth-class postmasters under the\r\ncivil-service law. The Administration has already put into effect the\r\npolicy of refusing to remove any fourth-class postmasters save for\r\nreasons connected with the good of the service; and it is endeavoring\r\nso far as possible to remove them from the domain of partisan politics.\r\nIt would be a most desirable thing to put the fourth-class postmasters\r\nin the classified service. It is possible that this might be done\r\nwithout Congressional action, but, as the matter is debatable, I\r\nearnestly recommend that the Congress enact a law providing that they\r\nbe included under the civil-service law and put in the classified\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nOklahoma has become a State, standing on a full equality with her elder\r\nsisters, and her future is assured by her great natural resources. The\r\nduty of the National Government to guard the personal and property\r\nrights of the Indians within her borders remains of course unchanged.\r\n\r\nI reiterate my recommendations of last year as regards Alaska. Some\r\nform of local self-government should be provided, as simple and\r\ninexpensive as possible; it is impossible for the Congress to devote\r\nthe necessary time to all the little details of necessary Alaskan\r\nlegislation. Road building and railway building should be encouraged.\r\nThe Governor of Alaska should be given an ample appropriation wherewith\r\nto organize a force to preserve the public peace. Whisky selling to the\r\nnatives should be made a felony. The coal land laws should be changed\r\nso as to meet the peculiar needs of the Territory. This should be\r\nattended to at once; for the present laws permit individuals to locate\r\nlarge areas of the public domain for speculative purposes; and cause an\r\nimmense amount of trouble, fraud, and litigation. There should be\r\nanother judicial division established. As early as possible lighthouses\r\nand buoys should be established as aids to navigation, especially in\r\nand about Prince William Sound, and the survey of the coast completed.\r\nThere is need of liberal appropriations for lighting and buoying the\r\nsouthern coast and improving the aids to navigation in southeastern\r\nAlaska. One of the great industries of Alaska, as of Puget Sound and\r\nthe Columbia, is salmon fishing. Gradually, by reason of lack of proper\r\nlaws, this industry is being ruined; it should now be taken in charge,\r\nand effectively protected, by the United States Government.\r\n\r\nThe courage and enterprise of the citizens of the far north-west in\r\ntheir projected Alaskan-Yukon-Pacific Exposition, to be held in 1909,\r\nshould receive liberal encouragement. This exposition is not\r\nsentimental in its conception, but seeks to exploit the natural\r\nresources of Alaska and to promote the commerce, trade, and industry of\r\nthe Pacific States with their neighboring States and with our insular\r\npossessions and the neighboring countries of the Pacific. The\r\nexposition asks no loan from the Congress but seeks appropriations for\r\nNational exhibits and exhibits of the western dependencies of the\r\nGeneral Government. The State of Washington and the city of Seattle\r\nhave shown the characteristic western enterprise in large donations for\r\nthe conduct of this exposition in which other States are lending\r\ngenerous assistance.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate failure of the shipping bill at the last session of the\r\nlast Congress was followed by the taking off of certain Pacific\r\nsteamships, which has greatly hampered the movement of passengers\r\nbetween Hawaii and the mainland. Unless the Congress is prepared by\r\npositive encouragement to secure proper facilities in the way of\r\nshipping between Hawaii and the mainland, then the coastwise shipping\r\nlaws should be so far relaxed as to prevent Hawaii suffering as it is\r\nnow suffering. I again call your attention to the capital importance\r\nfrom every standpoint of making Pearl Harbor available for the largest\r\ndeep water vessels, and of suitably fortifying the island.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War has gone to the Philippines. On his return I shall\r\nsubmit to you his report on the islands.\r\n\r\nI again recommend that the rights of citizenship be conferred upon the\r\npeople of Porto Rico.\r\n\r\nA bureau of mines should be created under the control and direction of\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior; the bureau to have power to collect\r\nstatistics and make investigations in all matters pertaining to mining\r\nand particularly to the accidents and dangers of the industry. If this\r\ncan not now be done, at least additional appropriations should be given\r\nthe Interior Department to be used for the study of mining conditions,\r\nfor the prevention of fraudulent mining schemes, for carrying on the\r\nwork of mapping the mining districts, for studying methods for\r\nminimizing the accidents and dangers in the industry; in short, to aid\r\nin all proper ways the development of the mining industry.\r\n\r\nI strongly recommend to the Congress to provide funds for keeping up\r\nthe Hermitage, the home of Andrew Jackson; these funds to be used\r\nthrough the existing Hermitage Association for the preservation of a\r\nhistoric building which should ever be dear to Americans.\r\n\r\nI further recommend that a naval monument be established in the\r\nVicksburg National Park. This national park gives a unique opportunity\r\nfor commemorating the deeds of those gallant men who fought on water,\r\nno less than of those who fought on land, in the great civil War.\r\n\r\nLegislation should be enacted at the present session of the Congress\r\nfor the Thirteenth Census. The establishment of the permanent Census\r\nBureau affords the opportunity for a better census than we have ever\r\nhad, but in order to realize the full advantage of the permanent\r\norganization, ample time must be given for preparation.\r\n\r\nThere is a constantly growing interest in this country in the question\r\nof the public health. At last the public mind is awake to the fact that\r\nmany diseases, notably tuberculosis, are National scourges. The work of\r\nthe State and city boards of health should be supplemented by a\r\nconstantly increasing interest on the part of the National Government.\r\nThe Congress has already provided a bureau of public health and has\r\nprovided for a hygienic laboratory. There are other valuable laws\r\nrelating to the public health connected with the various departments.\r\nThis whole branch of the Government should be strengthened and aided in\r\nevery way.\r\n\r\nI call attention to two Government commissions which I have appointed\r\nand which have already done excellent work. The first of these has to\r\ndo with the organization of the scientific work of the Government,\r\nwhich has grown up wholly without plan and is in consequence so\r\nunwisely distributed among the Executive Departments that much of its\r\neffect is lost for the lack of proper coordination. This commission's\r\nchief object is to introduce a planned and orderly development and\r\noperation in the place of the ill-assorted and often ineffective\r\ngrouping and methods of work which have prevailed. This can not be done\r\nwithout legislation, nor would it be feasible to deal in detail with so\r\ncomplex an administrative problem by specific provisions of law. I\r\nrecommend that the President be given authority to concentrate related\r\nlines of work and reduce duplication by Executive order through\r\ntransfer and consolidation of lines of work.\r\n\r\nThe second committee, that on Department methods, was instructed to\r\ninvestigate and report upon the changes needed to place the conduct of\r\nthe executive force of the Government on the most economical and\r\neffective basis in the light of the best modern business practice. The\r\ncommittee has made very satisfactory progress. Antiquated practices and\r\nbureaucratic ways have been abolished, and a general renovation of\r\ndepartmental methods has been inaugurated. All that can be done by\r\nExecutive order has already been accomplished or will be put into\r\neffect in the near future. The work of the main committee and its\r\nseveral assistant committees has produced a wholesome awakening on the\r\npart of the great body of officers and employees engaged in Government\r\nwork. In nearly every Department and office there has been a careful\r\nself-inspection for the purpose of remedying any defects before they\r\ncould be made the subject of adverse criticism. This has led\r\nindividuals to a wider study of the work on which they were engaged,\r\nand this study has resulted in increasing their efficiency in their\r\nrespective lines of work. There are recommendations of special\r\nimportance from the committee on the subject of personnel and the\r\nclassification of salaries which will require legislative action before\r\nthey can be put into effect. It is my intention to submit to the\r\nCongress in the near future a special message on those subjects.\r\n\r\nUnder our form of government voting is not merely a right but a duty,\r\nand, moreover, a fundamental and necessary duty if a man is to be a\r\ngood citizen. It is well to provide that corporations shall not\r\ncontribute to Presidential or National campaigns, and furthermore to\r\nprovide for the publication of both contributions and expenditures.\r\nThere is, however, always danger in laws of this kind, which from their\r\nvery nature are difficult of enforcement; the danger being lest they be\r\nobeyed only by the honest, and disobeyed by the unscrupulous, so as to\r\nact only as a penalty upon honest men. Moreover, no such law would\r\nhamper an unscrupulous man of unlimited means from buying his own way\r\ninto office. There is a very radical measure which would, I believe,\r\nwork a substantial improvement in our system of conducting a campaign,\r\nalthough I am well aware that it will take some time for people so to\r\nfamiliarize themselves with such a proposal as to be willing to\r\nconsider its adoption. The need for collecting large campaign funds\r\nwould vanish if Congress provided an appropriation for the proper and\r\nlegitimate expenses of each of the great national parties, an\r\nappropriation ample enough to meet the necessity for thorough\r\norganization and machinery, which requires a large expenditure of\r\nmoney. Then the stipulation should be made that no party receiving\r\ncampaign funds from the Treasury should accept more than a fixed amount\r\nfrom any individual subscriber or donor; and the necessary publicity\r\nfor receipts and expenditures could without difficulty be provided.\r\n\r\nThere should be a National gallery of art established in the capital\r\ncity of this country. This is important not merely to the artistic but\r\nto the material welfare of the country; and the people are to be\r\ncongratulated on the fact that the movement to establish such a gallery\r\nis taking definite form under the guidance of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution. So far from there being a tariff on works of art brought\r\ninto the country, their importation should be encouraged in every way.\r\nThere have been no sufficient collections of objects of art by the\r\nGovernment, and what collections have been acquired are scattered and\r\nare generally placed in unsuitable and imperfectly lighted galleries.\r\n\r\nThe Biological Survey is quietly working for the good of our\r\nagricultural interests, and is an excellent example of a Government\r\nbureau which conducts original scientific research the findings of\r\nwhich are of much practical utility. For more than twenty years it has\r\nstudied the food habits of birds and mammals that are injurious or\r\nbeneficial to agriculture, horticulture, and forestry; has distributed\r\nillustrated bulletins on the subject, and has labored to secure\r\nlegislative protection for the beneficial species. The cotton\r\nboll-weevil, which has recently overspread the cotton belt of Texas and\r\nis steadily extending its range, is said to cause an annual loss of\r\nabout $3,000,000. The Biological Survey has ascertained and gives wide\r\npublicity to the fact that at least 43 kinds of birds prey upon this\r\ndestructive insect. It has discovered that 57 species of birds feed\r\nupon scale-insects--dreaded enemies of the fruit grower. It has shown\r\nthat woodpeckers as a class, by destroying the larvae of wood-boring\r\ninsects, are so essential to tree life that it is doubtful if our\r\nforests could exist without them. It has shown that cuckoos and orioles\r\nare the natural enemies of the leaf-eating caterpillars that destroy\r\nour shade and fruit trees; that our quails and sparrows consume\r\nannually hundreds of tons of seeds of noxious weeds; that hawks and\r\nowls as a class (excepting the few that kill poultry and game birds)\r\nare markedly beneficial, spending their lives in catching grasshoppers,\r\nmice, and other pests that prey upon the products of husbandry. It has\r\nconducted field experiments for the purpose of devising and perfecting\r\nsimple methods for holding in check the hordes of destructive\r\nrodents--rats, mice, rabbits, gophers, prairie dogs, and ground\r\nsquirrels--which annually destroy crops worth many millions of dollars;\r\nand it has published practical directions for the destruction of wolves\r\nand coyotes on the stock ranges of the West, resulting during the past\r\nyear in an estimated saving of cattle and sheep valued at upwards of a\r\nmillion dollars.\r\n\r\nIt has inaugurated a system of inspection at the principal ports of\r\nentry on both Atlantic and Pacific coasts by means of which the\r\nintroduction of noxious mammals and birds is prevented, thus keeping\r\nout the mongoose and certain birds which are as much to be dreaded as\r\nthe previously introduced English sparrow and the house rats and mice.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of game protection it has cooperated with local\r\nofficials in every State in the Union, has striven to promote uniform\r\nlegislation in the several States, has rendered important service in\r\nenforcing the Federal law regulating interstate traffic in game, and\r\nhas shown how game protection may be made to yield a large revenue to\r\nthe State--a revenue amounting in the case of Illinois to $128,000 in a\r\nsingle year.\r\n\r\nThe Biological Survey has explored the faunas and floras of America\r\nwith reference to the distribution of animals and plants; it has\r\ndefined and mapped the natural life areas--areas in which, by reason of\r\nprevailing climatic conditions, certain kinds of animals and plants\r\noccur--and has pointed out the adaptability of these areas to the\r\ncultivation of particular crops. The results of these investigations\r\nare not only of high educational value but are worth each year to the\r\nprogressive farmers of the country many times the cost of maintaining\r\nthe Survey, which, it may be added, is exceedingly small. I recommend\r\nto Congress that this bureau, whose usefulness is seriously handicapped\r\nby lack of funds, be granted an appropriation in some degree\r\ncommensurate with the importance of the work it is doing.\r\n\r\nI call your especial attention to the unsatisfactory condition of our\r\nforeign mail service, which, because of the lack of American steamship\r\nlines is now largely done through foreign lines, and which,\r\nparticularly so far as South and Central America are concerned, is done\r\nin a manner which constitutes a serious barrier to the extension of our\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nThe time has come, in my judgment, to set to work seriously to make our\r\nocean mail service correspond more closely with our recent commercial\r\nand political development. A beginning was made by the ocean mail act\r\nof March 3, 1891, but even at that time the act was known to be\r\ninadequate in various particulars. Since that time events have moved\r\nrapidly in our history. We have acquired Hawaii, the Philippines, and\r\nlesser islands in the Pacific. We are steadily prosecuting the great\r\nwork of uniting at the Isthmus the waters of the Atlantic and the\r\nPacific. To a greater extent than seemed probable even a dozen years\r\nago, we may look to an American future on the sea worthy of the\r\ntraditions of our past. As the first step in that direction, and the\r\nstep most feasible at the present time, I recommend the extension of\r\nthe ocean mail act of 1891. This act has stood for some years free from\r\nsuccessful criticism of its principle and purpose. It was based on\r\ntheories of the obligations of a great maritime nation, undisputed in\r\nour own land and followed by other nations since the beginning of steam\r\nnavigation. Briefly those theories are, that it is the duty of a\r\nfirst-class Power so far as practicable to carry its ocean mails under\r\nits own flag; that the fast ocean steamships and their crews, required\r\nfor such mail service, are valuable auxiliaries to the sea power of a\r\nnation. Furthermore, the construction of such steamships insures the\r\nmaintenance in an efficient condition of the shipyards in which our\r\nbattleships must be built.\r\n\r\nThe expenditure of public money for the Performance of such necessary\r\nfunctions of government is certainly warranted, nor is it necessary to\r\ndwell upon the incidental benefits to our foreign commerce, to the\r\nshipbuilding industry, and to ship owning and navigation which will\r\naccompany the discharge of these urgent public duties, though they,\r\ntoo, should have weight.\r\n\r\nThe only serious question is whether at this time we can afford to\r\nimprove our ocean mail service as it should be improved. All doubt on\r\nthis subject is removed by the reports of the Post-Office Department.\r\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 1907, that Department estimates that\r\nthe postage collected on the articles exchanged with foreign countries\r\nother than Canada and Mexico amounted to $6,579,043.48, or\r\n$3,637,226.81 more than the net cost of the service exclusive of the\r\ncost of transporting the articles between the United States exchange\r\npost-offices and the United States post-offices at which they were\r\nmailed or delivered. In other words, the Government of the United\r\nStates, having assumed a monopoly of carrying the mails for the people,\r\nmaking a profit of over $3,600,000 by rendering a cheap and inefficient\r\nservice. That profit I believe should be devoted to strengthening\r\nmaritime power in those directions where it will best promote our\r\nprestige. The country is familiar with the facts of our maritime\r\nimpotence in the harbors of the great and friendly Republics of South\r\nAmerica. Following the failure of the shipbuilding bill we lost our\r\nonly American line of steamers to Australasia, and that loss on the\r\nPacific has become a serious embarrassment to the people of Hawaii, and\r\nhas wholly cut off the Samoan islands from regular communication with\r\nthe Pacific coast. Puget Sound, in the year, has lost over half (four\r\nout of seven) of its American steamers trading with the Orient.\r\n\r\nWe now pay under the act of 1891 $4 a statute mile outward to 20-knot\r\nAmerican mail steamships, built according to naval plans, available as\r\ncruisers, and manned by Americans. Steamships of that speed are\r\nconfined exclusively to trans-Atlantic trade with New York. To\r\nsteamships of 16 knots or over only $2 a mile can be paid, and it is\r\nsteamships of this speed and type which are needed to meet the\r\nrequirements of mail service to South America, Asia (including the\r\nPhilippines), and Australia. I strongly recommend, therefore, a simple\r\namendment to the ocean mail act of 1891 which shall authorize the\r\nPostmaster-General in his discretion to enter into contracts for the\r\ntransportation of mails to the Republics of South America, to Asia, the\r\nPhilippines, and Australia at a rate not to exceed $4 a mile for\r\nsteamships of 16 knots speed or upwards, subject to the restrictions\r\nand obligations of the act of 1891. The profit of $3,600,000 which has\r\nbeen mentioned will fully cover the maximum annual expenditure involved\r\nin this recommendation, and it is believed will in time establish the\r\nlines so urgently needed. The proposition involves no new principle,\r\nbut permits the efficient discharge of public functions now\r\ninadequately performed or not performed at all.\r\n\r\nNot only there is not now, but there never has been, any other nation\r\nin the world so wholly free from the evils of militarism as is ours.\r\nThere never has been any other large nation, not even China, which for\r\nso long a period has had relatively to its numbers so small a regular\r\narmy as has ours. Never at any time in our history has this Nation\r\nsuffered from militarism or been in the remotest danger of suffering\r\nfrom militarism. Never at any time of our history has the Regular Army\r\nbeen of a size which caused the slightest appreciable tax upon the\r\ntax-paying citizens of the Nation. Almost always it has been too small\r\nin size and underpaid. Never in our entire history has the Nation\r\nsuffered in the least particular because too much care has been given\r\nto the Army, too much prominence given it, too much money spent upon\r\nit, or because it has been too large. But again and again we have\r\nsuffered because enough care has not been given to it, because it has\r\nbeen too small, because there has not been sufficient preparation in\r\nadvance for possible war. Every foreign war in which we have engaged\r\nhas cost us many times the amount which, if wisely expended during the\r\npreceding years of peace on the Regular Army, would have insured the\r\nwar ending in but a fraction of the time and but for a fraction of the\r\ncost that was actually the case. As a Nation we have always been\r\nshortsighted in providing for the efficiency of the Army in time of\r\npeace. It is nobody's especial interest to make such provision and no\r\none looks ahead to war at any period, no matter how remote, as being a\r\nserious possibility; while an improper economy, or rather\r\nniggardliness, can be practiced at the expense of the Army with the\r\ncertainty that those practicing it will not be called to account\r\ntherefor, but that the price will be paid by the unfortunate persons\r\nwho happen to be in office when a war does actually come.\r\n\r\nI think it is only lack of foresight that troubles us, not any\r\nhostility to the Army. There are, of course, foolish people who\r\ndenounce any care of the Army or Navy as \"militarism,\" but I do not\r\nthink that these people are numerous. This country has to contend now,\r\nand has had to contend in the past, with many evils, and there is ample\r\nscope for all who would work for reform. But there is not one evil that\r\nnow exists, or that ever has existed in this country, which is, or ever\r\nhas been, owing in the smallest part to militarism. Declamation against\r\nmilitarism has no more serious place in an earnest and intelligent\r\nmovement for righteousness in this country than declamation against the\r\nworship of Baal or Astaroth. It is declamation against a non-existent\r\nevil, one which never has existed in this country, and which has not\r\nthe slightest chance of appearing here. We are glad to help in any\r\nmovement for international peace, but this is because we sincerely\r\nbelieve that it is our duty to help all such movements provided they\r\nare sane and rational, and not because there is any tendency toward\r\nmilitarism on our part which needs to be cured. The evils we have to\r\nfight are those in connection with industrialism, not militarism.\r\nIndustry is always necessary, just as war is sometimes necessary. Each\r\nhas its price, and industry in the United States now exacts, and has\r\nalways exacted, a far heavier toll of death than all our wars put\r\ntogether. The statistics of the railroads of this country for the year\r\nended June 30, 1906, the last contained in the annual statistical\r\nreport of the Interstate Commerce Commission, show in that one year a\r\ntotal of 108,324 casualties to persons, of which 10,618 represent the\r\nnumber of persons killed. In that wonderful hive of human activity,\r\nPittsburg, the deaths due to industrial accidents in 1906 were 919, all\r\nthe result of accidents in mills, mines or on railroads. For the entire\r\ncountry, therefore, it is safe to say that the deaths due to industrial\r\naccidents aggregate in the neighborhood of twenty thousand a year. Such\r\na record makes the death rate in all our foreign wars utterly trivial\r\nby comparison. The number of deaths in battle in all the foreign wars\r\nput together, for the last century and a quarter, aggregate\r\nconsiderably less than one year's death record for our industries. A\r\nmere glance at these figures is sufficient to show the absurdity of the\r\noutcry against militarism.\r\n\r\nBut again and again in the past our little Regular Army has rendered\r\nservice literally vital to the country, and it may at any time have to\r\ndo so in the future. Its standard of efficiency and instruction is\r\nhigher now than ever in the past. But it is too small. There are not\r\nenough officers; and it is impossible to secure enough enlisted men. We\r\nshould maintain in peace a fairly complete skeleton of a large army. A\r\ngreat and long-continued war would have to be fought by volunteers. But\r\nmonths would pass before any large body of efficient volunteers could\r\nbe put in the field, and our Regular Army should be large enough to\r\nmeet any immediate need. In particular it is essential that we should\r\npossess a number of extra officers trained in peace to perform\r\nefficiently the duties urgently required upon the breaking out of war.\r\n\r\nThe Medical Corps should be much larger than the needs of our Regular\r\nArmy in war. Yet at present it is smaller than the needs of the service\r\ndemand even in peace. The Spanish war occurred less than ten years ago.\r\nThe chief loss we suffered in it was by disease among the regiments\r\nwhich never left the country. At the moment the Nation seemed deeply\r\nimpressed by this fact; yet seemingly it has already been forgotten,\r\nfor not the slightest effort has been made to prepare a medical corps\r\nof sufficient size to prevent the repetition of the same disaster on a\r\nmuch larger scale if we should ever be engaged in a serious conflict.\r\nThe trouble in the Spanish war was not with the then existing officials\r\nof the War Department; it was with the representatives of the people as\r\na whole who, for the preceding thirty years, had declined to make the\r\nnecessary provision for the Army. Unless ample provision is now made by\r\nCongress to put the Medical Corps where it should be put disaster in\r\nthe next war is inevitable, and the responsibility will not lie with\r\nthose then in charge of the War Department, but with those who now\r\ndecline to make the necessary provision. A well organized medical\r\ncorps, thoroughly trained before the advent of war in all the important\r\nadministrative duties of a military sanitary corps, is essential to the\r\nefficiency of any large army, and especially of a large volunteer army.\r\nSuch knowledge of medicine and surgery as is possessed by the medical\r\nprofession generally will not alone suffice to make an efficient\r\nmilitary surgeon. He must have, in addition, knowledge of the\r\nadministration and sanitation of large field hospitals and camps, in\r\norder to safeguard the health and lives of men intrusted in great\r\nnumbers to his care. A bill has long been pending before the Congress\r\nfor the reorganization of the Medical Corps; its passage is urgently\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nBut the Medical Department is not the only department for which\r\nincreased provision should be made. The rate of pay for the officers\r\nshould be greatly increased; there is no higher type of citizen than\r\nthe American regular officer, and he should have a fair reward for his\r\nadmirable work. There should be a relatively even greater increase in\r\nthe pay for the enlisted men. In especial provision should be made for\r\nestablishing grades equivalent to those of warrant officers in the Navy\r\nwhich should be open to the enlisted men who serve sufficiently long\r\nand who do their work well. Inducements should be offered sufficient to\r\nencourage really good men to make the Army a life occupation. The prime\r\nneeds of our present Army is to secure and retain competent\r\nnoncommissioned officers. This difficulty rests fundamentally on the\r\nquestion of pay. The noncommissioned officer does not correspond with\r\nan unskilled laborer; he corresponds to the best type of skilled\r\nworkman or to the subordinate official in civil institutions. Wages\r\nhave greatly increased in outside occupations in the last forty years\r\nand the pay of the soldier, like the pay of the officers, should be\r\nproportionately increased. The first sergeant of a company, if a good\r\nman, must be one of such executive and administrative ability, and such\r\nknowledge of his trade, as to be worth far more than we at present pay\r\nhim. The same is true of the regimental sergeant major. These men\r\nshould be men who had fully resolved to make the Army a life occupation\r\nand they should be able to look forward to ample reward; while only men\r\nproperly qualified should be given a chance to secure these final\r\nrewards. The increase over the present pay need not be great in the\r\nlower grades for the first one or two enlistments, but the increase\r\nshould be marked for the noncommissioned officers of the upper grades\r\nwho serve long enough to make it evident that they intend to stay\r\npermanently in the Army, while additional pay should be given for high\r\nqualifications in target practice. The position of warrant officer\r\nshould be established and there should be not only an increase of pay,\r\nbut an increase of privileges and allowances and dignity, so as to make\r\nthe grade open to noncommissioned officers capable of filling them\r\ndesirably from every standpoint. The rate of desertion in our Army now\r\nin time of peace is alarming. The deserter should be treated by public\r\nopinion as a man guilty of the greatest crime; while on the other hand\r\nthe man who serves steadily in the Army should be treated as what he\r\nis, that is, as preeminently one of the best citizens of this Republic.\r\nAfter twelve years' service in the Army, my own belief is that the man\r\nshould be given a preference according to his ability for certain types\r\nof office over all civilian applicants without examination. This should\r\nalso apply, of course, to the men who have served twelve years in the\r\nNavy. A special corps should be provided to do the manual labor now\r\nnecessarily demanded of the privates themselves.\r\n\r\nAmong the officers there should be severe examinations to weed out the\r\nunfit up to the grade of major. From that position on appointments\r\nshould be solely by selection and it should be understood that a man of\r\nmerely average capacity could never get beyond the position of major,\r\nwhile every man who serves in any grade a certain length of time prior\r\nto promotion to the next grade without getting the promotion to the\r\nnext grade should be forthwith retired. The practice marches and field\r\nmaneuvers of the last two or three years have been invaluable to the\r\nArmy. They should be continued and extended. A rigid and not a\r\nperfunctory examination of physical capacity has been provided for the\r\nhigher grade officers. This will work well. Unless an officer has a\r\ngood physique, unless he can stand hardship, ride well, and walk\r\nfairly, he is not fit for any position, even after he has become a\r\ncolonel. Before he has become a colonel the need for physical fitness\r\nin the officers is almost as great as in the enlisted man. I hope\r\nspeedily to see introduced into the Army a far more rigid and\r\nthoroughgoing test of horsemanship for all field officers than at\r\npresent. There should be a Chief of Cavalry just as there is a Chief of\r\nArtillery.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important of all legislation needed for the benefit of\r\nthe Army is a law to equalize and increase the pay of officers and\r\nenlisted men of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Revenue-Cutter\r\nService. Such a bill has been prepared, which it is hoped will meet\r\nwith your favorable consideration. The next most essential measure is\r\nto authorize a number of extra officers as mentioned above. To make the\r\nArmy more attractive to enlisted men, it is absolutely essential to\r\ncreate a service corps, such as exists in nearly every modern army in\r\nthe world, to do the skilled and unskilled labor, inseparably connected\r\nwith military administration, which is now exacted, without just\r\ncompensation, of enlisted men who voluntarily entered the Army to do\r\nservice of an altogether different kind. There are a number of other\r\nlaws necessary to so organize the Army as to promote its efficiency and\r\nfacilitate its rapid expansion in time of war; but the above are the\r\nmost important.\r\n\r\nIt was hoped The Hague Conference might deal with the question of the\r\nlimitation of armaments. But even before it had assembled informal\r\ninquiries had developed that as regards naval armaments, the only ones\r\nin which this country had any interest, it was hopeless to try to\r\ndevise any plan for which there was the slightest possibility of\r\nsecuring the assent of the nations gathered at The Hague. No plan was\r\neven proposed which would have had the assent of more than one first\r\nclass Power outside of the United States. The only plan that seemed at\r\nall feasible, that of limiting the size of battleships, met with no\r\nfavor at all. It is evident, therefore, that it is folly for this\r\nNation to base any hope of securing peace on any international\r\nagreement as to the limitations of armaments. Such being the fact it\r\nwould be most unwise for us to stop the upbuilding of our Navy. To\r\nbuild one battleship of the best and most advanced type a year would\r\nbarely keep our fleet up to its present force. This is not enough. In\r\nmy judgment, we should this year provide for four battleships. But it\r\nis idle to build battleships unless in addition to providing the men,\r\nand the means for thorough training, we provide the auxiliaries for\r\nthem, unless we provide docks, the coaling stations, the colliers and\r\nsupply ships that they need. We are extremely deficient in coaling\r\nstations and docks on the Pacific, and this deficiency should not\r\nlonger be permitted to exist. Plenty of torpedo boats and destroyers\r\nshould be built. Both on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts,\r\nfortifications of the best type should be provided for all our greatest\r\nharbors.\r\n\r\nWe need always to remember that in time of war the Navy is not to be\r\nused to defend harbors and sea-coast cities; we should perfect our\r\nsystem of coast fortifications. The only efficient use for the Navy is\r\nfor offense. The only way in which it can efficiently protect our own\r\ncoast against the possible action of a foreign navy is by destroying\r\nthat foreign navy. For defense against a hostile fleet which actually\r\nattacks them, the coast cities must depend upon their forts, mines,\r\ntorpedoes, submarines, and torpedo boats and destroyers. All of these\r\ntogether are efficient for defensive purposes, but they in no way\r\nsupply the place of a thoroughly efficient navy capable of acting on\r\nthe offensive; for parrying never yet won a fight. It can only be won\r\nby hard hitting, and an aggressive sea-going navy alone can do this\r\nhard hitting of the offensive type. But the forts and the like are\r\nnecessary so that the Navy may be footloose. In time of war there is\r\nsure to be demand, under pressure, of fright, for the ships to be\r\nscattered so as to defend all kind of ports. Under penalty of terrible\r\ndisaster, this demand must be refused. The ships must be kept together,\r\nand their objective made the enemies' fleet. If fortifications are\r\nsufficiently strong, no modern navy will venture to attack them, so\r\nlong as the foe has in existence a hostile navy of anything like the\r\nsame size or efficiency. But unless there exists such a navy then the\r\nfortifications are powerless by themselves to secure the victory. For\r\nof course the mere deficiency means that any resolute enemy can at his\r\nleisure combine all his forces upon one point with the certainty that\r\nhe can take it.\r\n\r\nUntil our battle fleet is much larger than at present it should never\r\nbe split into detachments so far apart that they could not in event of\r\nemergency be speedily united. Our coast line is on the Pacific just as\r\nmuch as on the Atlantic. The interests of California, Oregon, and\r\nWashington are as emphatically the interests of the whole Union as\r\nthose of Maine and New York, of Louisiana and Texas. The battle fleet\r\nshould now and then be moved to the Pacific, just as at other times it\r\nshould be kept in the Atlantic. When the Isthmian Canal is built the\r\ntransit of the battle fleet from one ocean to the other will be\r\ncomparatively easy. Until it is built I earnestly hope that the battle\r\nfleet will be thus shifted between the two oceans every year or two.\r\nThe marksmanship on all our ships has improved phenomenally during the\r\nlast five years. Until within the last two or three years it was not\r\npossible to train a battle fleet in squadron maneuvers under service\r\nconditions, and it is only during these last two or three years that\r\nthe training under these conditions has become really effective.\r\nAnother and most necessary stride in advance is now being taken. The\r\nbattle fleet is about starting by the Straits of Magellan to visit the\r\nPacific coast.. Sixteen battleships are going under the command of\r\nRear-Admiral Evans, while eight armored cruisers and two other\r\nbattleships will meet him at San Francisco, whither certain torpedo\r\ndestroyers are also going. No fleet of such size has ever made such a\r\nvoyage, and it will be of very great educational use to all engaged in\r\nit. The only way by which to teach officers and men how to handle the\r\nfleet so as to meet every possible strain and emergency in time of war\r\nis to have them practice under similar conditions in time of peace.\r\nMoreover, the only way to find out our actual needs is to perform in\r\ntime of peace whatever maneuvers might be necessary in time of war.\r\nAfter war is declared it is too late to find out the needs; that means\r\nto invite disaster. This trip to the Pacific will show what some of our\r\nneeds are and will enable us to provide for them. The proper place for\r\nan officer to learn his duty is at sea, and the only way in which a\r\nnavy can ever be made efficient is by practice at sea, under all the\r\nconditions which would have to be met if war existed.\r\n\r\nI bespeak the most liberal treatment for the officers and enlisted men\r\nof the Navy. It is true of them, as likewise of the officers and\r\nenlisted men of the Army, that they form a body whose interests should\r\nbe close to the heart of every good American. In return the most rigid\r\nperformance of duty should be exacted from them. The reward should be\r\nample when they do their best; and nothing less than their best should\r\nbe tolerated. It is idle to hope for the best results when the men in\r\nthe senior grades come to those grades late in life and serve too short\r\na time in them. Up to the rank of lieutenant-commander promotion in the\r\nNavy should be as now, by seniority, subject, however, to such\r\nrigid tests as would eliminate the unfit. After the grade of\r\nlieutenant-commander, that is, when we come to the grade of command\r\nrank, the unfit should be eliminated in such manner that only the\r\nconspicuously fit would remain, and sea service should be a principal\r\ntest of fitness. Those who are passed by should, after a certain length\r\nof service in their respective grades, be retired. Of a given number of\r\nmen it may well be that almost all would make good lieutenants and most\r\nof them good lieutenant-commanders, while only a minority be fit to be\r\ncaptains, and but three or four to be admirals. Those who object to\r\npromotion otherwise than by mere seniority should reflect upon the\r\nelementary fact that no business in private life could be successfully\r\nmanaged if those who enter at the lowest rungs of the ladder should\r\neach in turn, if he lived, become the head of the firm, its active\r\ndirector, and retire after he had held the position a few months. On\r\nits face such a scheme is an absurdity. Chances for improper favoritism\r\ncan be minimized by a properly formed board; such as the board of last\r\nJune, which did such conscientious and excellent work in elimination.\r\n\r\nIf all that ought to be done can not now be done, at least let a\r\nbeginning be made. In my last three annual Messages, and in a special\r\nMessage to the last Congress, the necessity for legislation that will\r\ncause officers of the line of the Navy to reach the grades of captain\r\nand rear-admiral at less advanced ages and which will cause them to\r\nhave more sea training and experience in the highly responsible duties\r\nof those grades, so that they may become thoroughly skillful in\r\nhandling battleships, divisions, squadrons, and fleets in action, has\r\nbeen fully explained and urgently recommended. Upon this subject the\r\nSecretary of the Navy has submitted detailed and definite\r\nrecommendations which have received my approval, and which, if enacted\r\ninto law, will accomplish what is immediately necessary, and will, as\r\ncompared with existing law, make a saving of more than five millions of\r\ndollars during the next seven years. The navy personnel act of 1899 has\r\naccomplished all that was expected of it in providing satisfactory\r\nperiods of service in the several subordinate grades, from the grade of\r\nensign to the grade of lieutenant-commander, but the law is inadequate\r\nin the upper grades and will continue to be inadequate on account of\r\nthe expansion of the personnel since its enactment. Your attention is\r\ninvited to the following quotations from the report of the personnel\r\nboard of 1906, of which the Assistant Secretary of the Navy was\r\npresident:\r\n\r\n\"Congress has authorized a considerable increase in the number of\r\nmidshipmen at the Naval Academy, and these midshipmen upon graduation\r\nare promoted to ensign and lieutenant (junior-grade). But no provision\r\nhas been made for a corresponding increase in the upper grades, the\r\nresult being that the lower grades will become so congested that a\r\nmidshipman now in one of the lowest classes at Annapolis may possibly\r\nnot be promoted to lieutenant until he is between 45 and 50 years of\r\nage. So it will continue under the present law, congesting at the top\r\nand congesting at the bottom. The country fails to get from the\r\nofficers of the service the best that is in them by not providing\r\nopportunity for their normal development and training. The board\r\nbelieves that this works a serious detriment to the efficiency of the\r\nNavy and is a real menace to the public safety.\"\r\n\r\nAs stated in my special Message to the last Congress: \"I am firmly of\r\nthe opinion that unless the present conditions of the higher\r\ncommissioned personnel is rectified by judicious legislation the future\r\nof our Navy will be gravely compromised.\" It is also urgently necessary\r\nto increase the efficiency of the Medical Corps of the Navy. Special\r\nlegislation to this end has already been proposed; and I trust it may\r\nbe enacted without delay.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that everything done in the Navy to fit it to do\r\nwell in time of war must be done in time of peace. Modern wars are\r\nshort; they do not last the length of time requisite to build a\r\nbattleship; and it takes longer to train the officers and men to do\r\nwell on a battleship than it takes to build it. Nothing effective can\r\nbe done for the Navy once war has begun, and the result of the war, if\r\nthe combatants are otherwise equally matched, will depend upon which\r\npower has prepared best in time of peace. The United States Navy is the\r\nbest guaranty the Nation has that its honor and interest will not be\r\nneglected; and in addition it offers by far the best insurance for\r\npeace that can by human ingenuity be devised.\r\n\r\nI call attention to the report of the official Board of Visitors to the\r\nNaval Academy at Annapolis which has been forwarded to the Congress.\r\nThe report contains this paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"Such revision should be made of the courses of study and methods of\r\nconducting and marking examinations as will develop and bring out the\r\naverage all-round ability of the midshipman rather than to give him\r\nprominence in any one particular study. The fact should be kept in mind\r\nthat the Naval Academy is not a university but a school, the primary\r\nobject of which is to educate boys to be efficient naval officers.\r\nChanges in curriculum, therefore, should be in the direction of making\r\nthe course of instruction less theoretical and more practical. No\r\nportion of any future class should be graduated in advance of the full\r\nfour years' course, and under no circumstances should the standard of\r\ninstruction be lowered. The Academy in almost all of its departments is\r\nnow magnificently equipped, and it would be very unwise to make the\r\ncourse of instruction less exacting than it is to-day.\"\r\n\r\nActing upon this suggestion I designated three seagoing officers, Capt.\r\nRichard Wainwright, Commander Robert S. Griffin, and Lieut. Commander\r\nAlbert L. Key, all graduates of the Academy, to investigate conditions\r\nand to recommend to me the best method of carrying into effect this\r\ngeneral recommendation. These officers performed the duty promptly and\r\nintelligently, and, under the personal direction of Capt. Charles J.\r\nBadger, Superintendent of the Academy, such of the proposed changes as\r\nwere deemed to be at present advisable were put into effect at the\r\nbeginning of the academic year, October 1, last. The results, I am\r\nconfident, will be most beneficial to the Academy, to the midshipmen,\r\nand to the Navy.\r\n\r\nIn foreign affairs this country's steady policy is to behave toward\r\nother nations as a strong and self-respecting man should behave toward\r\nthe other men with whom he is brought into contact. In other words, our\r\naim is disinterestedly to help other nations where such help can be\r\nwisely given without the appearance of meddling with what does not\r\nconcern us; to be careful to act as a good neighbor; and at the same\r\ntime, in good-natured fashion, to make it evident that we do not intend\r\nto be imposed upon.\r\n\r\nThe Second International Peace Conference was convened at The Hague on\r\nthe 15th of June last and remained in session until the 18th of\r\nOctober. For the first time the representatives of practically all the\r\ncivilized countries of the world united in a temperate and kindly\r\ndiscussion of the methods by which the causes of war might be narrowed\r\nand its injurious effects reduced.\r\n\r\nAlthough the agreements reached in the Conference did not in any\r\ndirection go to the length hoped for by the more sanguine, yet in many\r\ndirections important steps were taken, and upon every subject on the\r\nprogramme there was such full and considerate discussion as to justify\r\nthe belief that substantial progress has been made toward further\r\nagreements in the future. Thirteen conventions were agreed upon\r\nembodying the definite conclusions which had been reached, and\r\nresolutions were adopted marking the progress made in matters upon\r\nwhich agreement was not yet sufficiently complete to make conventions\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\nThe delegates of the United States were instructed to favor an\r\nagreement for obligatory arbitration, the establishment of a permanent\r\ncourt of arbitration to proceed judicially in the hearing and decision\r\nof international causes, the prohibition of force for the collection of\r\ncontract debts alleged to be due from governments to citizens of other\r\ncountries until after arbitration as to the justice and amount of the\r\ndebt and the time and manner of payment, the immunity of private\r\nproperty at sea, the better definition of the rights of neutrals, and,\r\nin case any measure to that end should be introduced, the limitation of\r\narmaments.\r\n\r\nIn the field of peaceful disposal of international differences several\r\nimportant advances were made. First, as to obligatory arbitration.\r\nAlthough the Conference failed to secure a unanimous agreement upon the\r\ndetails of a convention for obligatory arbitration, it did resolve as\r\nfollows;\r\n\r\n\"It is unanimous: (1) In accepting the principle for obligatory\r\narbitration; (2) In declaring that certain differences, and notably\r\nthose relating to the interpretation and application of international\r\nconventional stipulations are susceptible of being submitted to\r\nobligatory arbitration without any restriction.\"\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that as a result of the discussion the vote upon\r\nthe definite treaty of obligatory arbitration, which was proposed,\r\nstood 32 in favor to 9 against the adoption of the treaty, there can be\r\nlittle doubt that the great majority of the countries of the world have\r\nreached a point where they are now ready to apply practically the\r\nprinciples thus unanimously agreed upon by the Conference.\r\n\r\nThe second advance, and a very great one, is the agreement which\r\nrelates to the use of force for the collection of contract debts. Your\r\nattention is invited to the paragraphs upon this subject in my Message\r\nof December, 1906, and to the resolution of the Third American\r\nConference at Rio in the summer of 1906. The convention upon this\r\nsubject adopted by the Conference substantially as proposed by the\r\nAmerican delegates is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In order to avoid between nations armed conflicts of a purely\r\npecuniary origin arising from contractual debts claimed of the\r\ngovernment of one country by the government of another country to be\r\ndue to its nationals, the signatory Powers agree not to have recourse\r\nto armed force for the collection of such contractual debts.\r\n\r\n\"However, this stipulation shall not be applicable when the debtor\r\nState refuses or leaves unanswered an offer to arbitrate, or, in case\r\nof acceptance, makes it impossible to formulate the terms of\r\nsubmission, or, after arbitration, fails to comply with the award\r\nrendered.\r\n\r\n\"It is further agreed that arbitration here contemplated shall be in\r\nconformity, as to procedure, with Chapter III of the Convention for the\r\nPacific Settlement of International Disputes adopted at The Hague, and\r\nthat it shall determine, in so far as there shall be no agreement\r\nbetween the parties, the justice and the amount of the debt, the time\r\nand mode of payment thereof.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a provision would have prevented much injustice and extortion in\r\nthe past, and I cannot doubt that its effect in the future will be most\r\nsalutary.\r\n\r\nA third advance has been made in amending and perfecting the convention\r\nof 1899 for the voluntary settlement of international disputes, and\r\nparticularly the extension of those parts of that convention which\r\nrelate to commissions of inquiry. The existence of those provisions\r\nenabled the Governments of Great Britain and Russia to avoid war,\r\nnotwithstanding great public excitement, at the time of the Dogger Bank\r\nincident, and the new convention agreed upon by the Conference gives\r\npractical effect to the experience gained in that inquiry.\r\n\r\nSubstantial progress was also made towards the creation of a permanent\r\njudicial tribunal for the determination of international causes. There\r\nwas very full discussion of the proposal for such a court and a general\r\nagreement was finally reached in favor of its creation. The Conference\r\nrecommended to the signatory Powers the adoption of a draft upon which\r\nit agreed for the organization of the court, leaving to be determined\r\nonly the method by which the judges should be selected. This remaining\r\nunsettled question is plainly one which time and good temper will\r\nsolve.\r\n\r\nA further agreement of the first importance was that for the creation\r\nof an international prize court. The constitution, organization and\r\nprocedure of such a tribunal were provided for in detail. Anyone who\r\nrecalls the injustices under which this country suffered as a neutral\r\npower during the early part of the last century can not fail to see in\r\nthis provision for an international prize court the great advance which\r\nthe world is making towards the substitution of the rule of reason and\r\njustice in place of simple force. Not only will the international prize\r\ncourt be the means of protecting the interests of neutrals, but it is\r\nin itself a step towards the creation of the more general court for the\r\nhearing of international controversies to which reference has just been\r\nmade. The organization and action of such a prize court can not fail to\r\naccustom the different countries to the submission of international\r\nquestions to the decision of an international tribunal, and we may\r\nconfidently expect the results of such submission to bring about a\r\ngeneral agreement upon the enlargement of the practice.\r\n\r\nNumerous provisions were adopted for reducing the evil effects of war\r\nand for defining the rights and duties of neutrals.\r\n\r\nThe Conference also provided for the holding of a third Conference\r\nwithin a period similar to that which elapsed between the First and\r\nSecond Conferences.\r\n\r\nThe delegates of the United States worthily represented the spirit of\r\nthe American people and maintained with fidelity and ability the policy\r\nof our Government upon all the great questions discussed in the\r\nConference.\r\n\r\nThe report of the delegation, together with authenticated copies of the\r\nconventions signed, when received, will be laid before the Senate for\r\nits consideration.\r\n\r\nWhen we remember how difficult it is for one of our own legislative\r\nbodies, composed of citizens of the same country, speaking the same\r\nlanguage, living under the same laws, and having the same customs, to\r\nreach an agreement, or even to secure a majority upon any difficult and\r\nimportant subject which is proposed for legislation, it becomes plain\r\nthat the representatives of forty-five different countries, speaking\r\nmany different languages, accustomed to different methods of procedure,\r\nwith widely diverse interests, who discussed so many different subjects\r\nand reached agreements upon so many, are entitled to grateful\r\nappreciation for the wisdom, patience, and moderation with which they\r\nhave discharged their duty. The example of this temperate discussion,\r\nand the agreements and the efforts to agree, among representatives of\r\nall the nations of the earth, acting with universal recognition of the\r\nsupreme obligation to promote peace, can not fail to be a powerful\r\ninfluence for good in future international relations.\r\n\r\nA year ago in consequence of a revolutionary movement in Cuba which\r\nthreatened the immediate return to chaos of the island, the United\r\nStates intervened, sending down an army and establishing a provisional\r\ngovernment under Governor Magoon. Absolute quiet and prosperity have\r\nreturned to the island because of this action. We are now taking steps\r\nto provide for elections in the island and our expectation is within\r\nthe coming year to be able to turn the island over again to government\r\nchosen by the people thereof. Cuba is at our doors. It is not possible\r\nthat this Nation should permit Cuba again to sink into the condition\r\nfrom which we rescued it. All that we ask of the Cuban people is that\r\nthey be prosperous, that they govern themselves so as to bring content,\r\norder and progress to their island, the Queen of the Antilles; and our\r\nonly interference has been and will be to help them achieve these\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nAn invitation has been extended by Japan to the Government and people\r\nof the United States to participate in a great national exposition to\r\nbe held at Tokyo from April 1 to October 31, 1912, and in which the\r\nprincipal countries of the world are to be invited to take part. This\r\nis an occasion of special interest to all the nations of the world, and\r\npeculiarly so to us; for it is the first instance in which such a great\r\nnational exposition has been held by a great power dwelling on the\r\nPacific; and all the nations of Europe and America will, I trust, join\r\nin helping to success this first great exposition ever held by a great\r\nnation of Asia. The geographical relations of Japan and the United\r\nStates as the possessors of such large portions of the coasts of the\r\nPacific, the intimate trade relations already existing between the two\r\ncountries, the warm friendship which has been maintained between them\r\nwithout break since the opening of Japan to intercourse with the\r\nwestern nations, and her increasing wealth and production, which we\r\nregard with hearty goodwill and wish to make the occasion of mutually\r\nbeneficial commerce, all unite in making it eminently desirable that\r\nthis invitation should be accepted. I heartily recommend such\r\nlegislation as will provide in generous fashion for the representation\r\nof this Government and its people in the proposed exposition. Action\r\nshould be taken now. We are apt to underestimate the time necessary for\r\npreparation in such cases. The invitation to the French Exposition of\r\n1900 was brought to the attention of the Congress by President\r\nCleveland in December, 1895; and so many are the delays necessary to\r\nsuch proceedings that the period of font years and a half which then\r\nintervened before the exposition proved none too long for the proper\r\npreparation of the exhibits.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of a new tariff by Germany, accompanied by conventions for\r\nreciprocal tariff concessions between that country and most of the\r\nother countries of continental Europe, led the German Government to\r\ngive the notice necessary to terminate the reciprocal commercial\r\nagreement with this country proclaimed July 13, 1900. The notice was to\r\ntake effect on the 1st of March, 1906, and in default of some other\r\narrangements this would have left the exports from the United States to\r\nGermany subject to the general German tariff duties, from 25 to 50 per\r\ncent higher than the conventional duties imposed upon the goods of most\r\nof our competitors for German trade.\r\n\r\nUnder a special agreement made between the two Governments in February,\r\n1906, the German Government postponed the operation of their notice\r\nuntil the 30th of June, 1907. In the meantime, deeming it to be my duty\r\nto make every possible effort to prevent a tariff war between the\r\nUnited States and Germany arising from misunderstanding by either\r\ncountry of the conditions existing in the other, and acting upon the\r\ninvitation of the German Government, I sent to Berlin a commission\r\ncomposed of competent experts in the operation and administration of\r\nthe customs tariff, from the Departments of the Treasury and Commerce\r\nand Labor. This commission was engaged for several mouths in conference\r\nwith a similar commission appointed by the German Government, under\r\ninstructions, so far as practicable, to reach a common understanding as\r\nto all the facts regarding the tariffs of the United States and Germany\r\nmaterial and relevant to the trade relations between the two countries.\r\nThe commission reported, and upon the basis of the report, a further\r\ntemporary commercial agreement was entered into by the two countries,\r\npursuant to which, in the exercise of the authority conferred upon the\r\nPresident by the third section of the tariff act of July 24, 1897, I\r\nextended the reduced tariff rates provided for in that section to\r\nchampagne and all other sparkling wines, and pursuant to which the\r\nGerman conventional or minimum tariff rates were extended to about 96\r\n1/2 per cent of all the exports from the United States to Germany. This\r\nagreement is to remain in force until the 30th of June, 1908, and until\r\nsix months after notice by either party to terminate it.\r\n\r\nThe agreement and the report of the commission on which it is based\r\nwill be laid before the Congress for its information.\r\n\r\nThis careful examination into the tariff relations between the United\r\nStates and Germany involved an inquiry into certain of our methods of\r\nadministration which had been the cause of much complaint on the part\r\nof German exporters. In this inquiry I became satisfied that certain\r\nvicious and unjustifiable practices had grown up in our customs\r\nadministration, notably the practice of determining values of imports\r\nupon detective reports never disclosed to the persons whose interests\r\nwere affected. The use of detectives, though often necessary, tends\r\ntowards abuse, and should be carefully guarded. Under our practice as I\r\nfound it to exist in this case, the abuse had become gross and\r\ndiscreditable. Under it, instead of seeking information as to the\r\nmarket value of merchandise from the well-known and respected members\r\nof the commercial community in the country of its production, secret\r\nstatements were obtained from informers and discharged employees and\r\nbusiness rivals, and upon this kind of secret evidence the values of\r\nimported goods were frequently raised and heavy penalties were\r\nfrequently imposed upon importers who were never permitted to know what\r\nthe evidence was and who never had an opportunity to meet it. It is\r\nquite probable that this system tended towards an increase of the\r\nduties collected upon imported goods, but I conceive it to be a\r\nviolation of law to exact more duties than the law provides, just as it\r\nis a violation to admit goods upon the payment of less than the legal\r\nrate of duty. This practice was repugnant to the spirit of American law\r\nand to American sense of justice. In the judgment of the most competent\r\nexperts of the Treasury Department and the Department of Commerce and\r\nLabor it was wholly unnecessary for the due collection of the customs\r\nrevenues, and the attempt to defend it merely illustrates the\r\ndemoralization which naturally follows from a long continued course of\r\nreliance upon such methods. I accordingly caused the regulations\r\ngoverning this branch of the customs service to be modified so that\r\nvalues are determined upon a hearing in which all the parties\r\ninterested have an opportunity to be heard and to know the evidence\r\nagainst them. Moreover our Treasury agents are accredited to the\r\ngovernment of the country in which they seek information, and in\r\nGermany receive the assistance of the quasi-official chambers of\r\ncommerce in determining the actual market value of goods, in accordance\r\nwith what I am advised to be the true construction of the law.\r\n\r\nThese changes of regulations were adapted to the removal of such\r\nmanifest abuses that I have not felt that they ought to be confined to\r\nour relations with Germany; and I have extended their operation to all\r\nother countries which have expressed a desire to enter into similar\r\nadministrative relations.\r\n\r\nI ask for authority to reform the agreement with China under which the\r\nindemnity of 1900 was fixed, by remitting and cancelling the obligation\r\nof China for the payment of all that part of the stipulated indemnity\r\nwhich is in excess of the sum of eleven million, six hundred and\r\nfifty-five thousand, four hundred and ninety-two dollars and sixty-nine\r\ncents, and interest at four per cent. After the rescue of the foreign\r\nlegations in Peking during the Boxer troubles in 1900 the Powers\r\nrequired from China the payment of equitable indemnities to the several\r\nnations, and the final protocol under which the troops were withdrawn,\r\nsigned at Peking, September 7, 1901, fixed the amount of this indemnity\r\nallotted to the United States at over $20,000,000, and China paid, up\r\nto and including the 1st day of June last, a little over $6,000,000. It\r\nwas the first intention of this Government at the proper time, when all\r\nclaims had been presented and all expenses ascertained as fully as\r\npossible, to revise the estimates and account, and as a proof of\r\nsincere friendship for China voluntarily to release that country from\r\nits legal liability for all payments in excess of the sum which should\r\nprove to be necessary for actual indemnity to the United States and its\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nThis Nation should help in every practicable way in the education of\r\nthe Chinese people, so that the vast and populous Empire of China may\r\ngradually adapt itself to modern conditions. One way of doing this is\r\nby promoting the coming of Chinese students to this country and making\r\nit attractive to them to take courses at our universities and higher\r\neducational institutions. Our educators should, so far as possible,\r\ntake concerted action toward this end.\r\n\r\nOn the courteous invitation of the President of Mexico, the Secretary\r\nof State visited that country in September and October and was received\r\neverywhere with the greatest kindness and hospitality.\r\n\r\nHe carried from the Government of the United States to our southern\r\nneighbor a message of respect and good will and of desire for better\r\nacquaintance and increasing friendship. The response from the\r\nGovernment and the people of Mexico was hearty and sincere. No pains\r\nwere spared to manifest the most friendly attitude and feeling toward\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nIn view of the close neighborhood of the two countries the relations\r\nwhich exist between Mexico and the United States are just cause for\r\ngratification. We have a common boundary of over 1,500 miles from the\r\nGulf of Mexico to the Pacific. Much of it is marked only by the\r\nshifting waters of the Rio Grande. Many thousands of Mexicans are\r\nresiding upon our side of the line and it is estimated that over 40,000\r\nAmericans are resident in Mexican territory and that American\r\ninvestments in Mexico amount to over seven hundred million dollars. The\r\nextraordinary industrial and commercial prosperity of Mexico has been\r\ngreatly promoted by American enterprise, and Americans are sharing\r\nlargely in its results. The foreign trade of the Republic already\r\nexceeds $240,000,000 per annum, and of this two-thirds both of exports\r\nand imports are exchanged with the United States. Under these\r\ncircumstances numerous questions necessarily arise between the two\r\ncountries. These questions are always approached and disposed of in a\r\nspirit of mutual courtesy and fair dealing. Americans carrying on\r\nbusiness in Mexico testify uniformly to the kindness and consideration\r\nwith which they are treated and their sense of the security of their\r\nproperty and enterprises under the wise administration of the great\r\nstatesman who has so long held the office of Chief Magistrate of that\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nThe two Governments have been uniting their efforts for a considerable\r\ntime past to aid Central America in attaining the degree of peace and\r\norder which have made possible the prosperity of the northern ports of\r\nthe Continent. After the peace between Guatemala, Honduras, and\r\nSalvador, celebrated under the circumstances described in my last\r\nMessage, a new war broke out between the Republics of Nicaragua,\r\nHonduras, and Salvador. The effort to compose this new difficulty has\r\nresulted in the acceptance of the joint suggestion of the Presidents of\r\nMexico and of the United States for a general peace conference between\r\nall the countries of Central America. On the 17th day of September last\r\na protocol was signed between the representatives of the five Central\r\nAmerican countries accredited to this Government agreeing upon a\r\nconference to be held in the City of Washington \"in order to devise the\r\nmeans of preserving the good relations among said Republics and\r\nbringing about permanent peace in those countries.\" The protocol\r\nincludes the expression of a wish that the Presidents of the United\r\nStates and Mexico should appoint \"representatives to lend their good\r\nand impartial offices in a purely friendly way toward the realization\r\nof the objects of the conference.\" The conference is now in session and\r\nwill have our best wishes and, where it is practicable, our friendly\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nOne of the results of the Pan American Conference at Rio Janeiro in the\r\nsummer of 1906 has been a great increase in the activity and usefulness\r\nof the International Bureau of American Republics. That institution,\r\nwhich includes all the American Republics in its membership and brings\r\nall their representatives together, is doing a really valuable work in\r\ninforming the people of the United States about the other Republics and\r\nin making the United States known to them. Its action is now limited by\r\nappropriations determined when it was doing a work on a much smaller\r\nscale and rendering much less valuable service. I recommend that the\r\ncontribution of this Government to the expenses of the Bureau be made\r\ncommensurate with its increased work.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nTheodore Roosevelt\r\nDecember 8, 1908\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nFINANCES.\r\n\r\nThe financial standing of the Nation at the present time is excellent,\r\nand the financial management of the Nation's interests by the\r\nGovernment during the last seven years has shown the most satisfactory\r\nresults. But our currency system is imperfect, and it is earnestly to\r\nbe hoped that the Currency Commission will be able to propose a\r\nthoroughly good system which will do away with the existing defects.\r\n\r\nDuring the period from July 1, 1901, to September 30, 1908, there was\r\nan increase in the amount of money in circulation of $902,991,399. The\r\nincrease in the per capita during this period was $7.06. Within this\r\ntime there were several occasions when it was necessary for the\r\nTreasury Department to come to the relief of the money market by\r\npurchases or redemptions of United States bonds; by increasing deposits\r\nin national banks; by stimulating additional issues of national bank\r\nnotes, and by facilitating importations from abroad of gold. Our\r\nimperfect currency system has made these proceedings necessary, and\r\nthey were effective until the monetary disturbance in the fall of 1907\r\nimmensely increased the difficulty of ordinary methods of relief. By\r\nthe middle of November the available working balance in the Treasury\r\nhad been reduced to approximately $5,000,000. Clearing house\r\nassociations throughout the country had been obliged to resort to the\r\nexpedient of issuing clearing house certificates, to be used as money.\r\nIn this emergency it was determined to invite subscriptions for\r\n$50,000,000 Panama Canal bonds, and $100,000,000 three per cent\r\ncertificates of indebtedness authorized by the act of June 13, 1898. It\r\nwas proposed to re-deposit in the national banks the proceeds of these\r\nissues, and to permit their use as a basis for additional circulating\r\nnotes of national banks. The moral effect of this procedure was so\r\ngreat that it was necessary to issue only $24,631,980 of the Panama\r\nCanal bonds and $15,436,500 of the certificates of indebtedness.\r\n\r\nDuring the period from July 1, 1901, to September 30, 1908, the balance\r\nbetween the net ordinary receipts and the net ordinary expenses of the\r\nGovernment showed a surplus in the four years 1902, 1903, 1906 and\r\n1907, and a deficit in the years 1904, 1905, 1908 and a fractional part\r\nof the fiscal year 1909. The net result was a surplus of\r\n$99,283,413.54. The financial operations of the Government during this\r\nperiod, based upon these differences between receipts and expenditures,\r\nresulted in a net reduction of the interest-bearing debt of the United\r\nStates from $987,141,040 to $897,253,990, notwithstanding that there\r\nhad been two sales of Panama Canal bonds amounting in the aggregate to\r\n$54,631,980, and an issue of three per cent certificates of\r\nindebtedness under the act of June 13, 1998, amounting to $15,436,500.\r\nRefunding operations of the Treasury Department under the act of March\r\n14, 1900, resulted in the conversion into two per cent consols of 1930\r\nof $200,309,400 bonds bearing higher rates of interest. A decrease of\r\n$8,687,956 in the annual interest charge resulted from these\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nIn short, during the seven years and three months there has been a net\r\nsurplus of nearly one hundred millions of receipts over expenditures, a\r\nreduction of the interest-bearing debt by ninety millions, in spite of\r\nthe extraordinary expense of the Panama Canal, and a saving of nearly\r\nnine millions on the annual interest charge. This is an exceedingly\r\nsatisfactory showing, especially in view of the fact that during this\r\nperiod the Nation has never hesitated to undertake any expenditure that\r\nit regarded as necessary. There have been no new taxes and no increase\r\nof taxes; on the contrary, some taxes have been taken off; there has\r\nbeen a reduction of taxation.\r\n\r\nCORPORATIONS.\r\n\r\nAs regards the great corporations engaged in interstate business, and\r\nespecially the railroad, I can only repeat what I have already again\r\nand again said in my messages to the Congress, I believe that under the\r\ninterstate clause of the Constitution the United States has complete\r\nand paramount right to control all agencies of interstate commerce, and\r\nI believe that the National Government alone can exercise this right\r\nwith wisdom and effectiveness so as both to secure justice from, and to\r\ndo justice to, the great corporations which are the most important\r\nfactors in modern business. I believe that it is worse than folly to\r\nattempt to prohibit all combinations as is done by the Sherman\r\nanti-trust law, because such a law can be enforced only imperfectly and\r\nunequally, and its enforcement works almost as much hardship as good. I\r\nstrongly advocate that instead of an unwise effort to prohibit all\r\ncombinations there shall be substituted a law which shall expressly\r\npermit combinations which are in the interest of the public, but shall\r\nat the same time give to some agency of the National Government full\r\npower of control and supervision over them. One of the chief features\r\nof this control should be securing entire publicity in all matters\r\nwhich the public has a right to know, and furthermore, the power, not\r\nby judicial but by executive action, to prevent or put a stop to every\r\nform of improper favoritism or other wrongdoing.\r\n\r\nThe railways of the country should be put completely under the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission and removed from the domain of the\r\nanti-trust law. The power of the Commission should be made\r\nthoroughgoing, so that it could exercise complete supervision and\r\ncontrol over the issue of securities as well as over the raising and\r\nlowering of rates. As regards rates, at least, this power should be\r\nsummary. The power to investigate the financial operations and accounts\r\nof the railways has been one of the most valuable features in recent\r\nlegislation. Power to make combinations and traffic agreements should\r\nbe explicitly conferred upon the railroads, the permission of the\r\nCommission being first gained and the combination or agreement being\r\npublished in all its details. In the interest of the public the\r\nrepresentatives of the public should have complete power to see that\r\nthe railroads do their duty by the public, and as a matter of course\r\nthis power should also be exercised so as to see that no injustice is\r\ndone to the railroads. The shareholders, the employees and the shippers\r\nall have interests that must be guarded. It is to the interest of all\r\nof them that no swindling stock speculation should be allowed, and that\r\nthere should be no improper issuance of securities. The guiding\r\nintelligences necessary for the successful building and successful\r\nmanagement of railroads should receive ample remuneration; but no man\r\nshould be allowed to make money in connection with railroads out of\r\nfraudulent over-capitalization and kindred stock-gambling performances;\r\nthere must be no defrauding of investors, oppression of the farmers and\r\nbusiness men who ship freight, or callous disregard of the rights and\r\nneeds of the employees. In addition to this the interests of the\r\nshareholders, of the employees, and of the shippers should all be\r\nguarded as against one another. To give any one of them undue and\r\nimproper consideration is to do injustice to the others. Rates must be\r\nmade as low as is compatible with giving proper returns to all the\r\nemployees of the railroad, from the highest to the lowest, and proper\r\nreturns to the shareholders; but they must not, for instance, be\r\nreduced in such fashion as to necessitate a cut in the wages of the\r\nemployees or the abolition of the proper and legitimate profits of\r\nhonest shareholders.\r\n\r\nTelegraph and telephone companies engaged in interstate business should\r\nbe put under the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission.\r\n\r\nIt is very earnestly to be wished that our people, through their\r\nrepresentatives, should act in this matter. It is hard to say whether\r\nmost damage to the country at large would come from entire failure on\r\nthe part of the public to supervise and control the actions of the\r\ngreat corporations, or from the exercise of the necessary governmental\r\npower in a way which would do injustice and wrong to the corporations.\r\nBoth the preachers of an unrestricted individualism, and the preachers\r\nof an oppression which would deny to able men of business the just\r\nreward of their initiative and business sagacity, are advocating\r\npolicies that would be fraught with the gravest harm to the whole\r\ncountry. To permit every lawless capitalist, every law-defying\r\ncorporation, to take any action, no matter how iniquitous, in the\r\neffort to secure an improper profit and to build up privilege, would be\r\nruinous to the Republic and would mark the abandonment of the effort to\r\nsecure in the industrial world the spirit of democratic fair dealing.\r\nOn the other hand, to attack these wrongs in that spirit of demagogy\r\nwhich can see wrong only when committed by the man of wealth, and is\r\ndumb and blind in the presence of wrong committed against men of\r\nproperty or by men of no property, is exactly as evil as corruptly to\r\ndefend the wrongdoing of men of wealth. The war we wage must be waged\r\nagainst misconduct, against wrongdoing wherever it is found; and we\r\nmust stand heartily for the rights of every decent man, whether he be a\r\nman of great wealth or a man who earns his livelihood as a wage-worker\r\nor a tiller of the soil.\r\n\r\nIt is to the interest of all of us that there should be a premium put\r\nupon individual initiative and individual capacity, and an ample reward\r\nfor the great directing intelligences alone competent to manage the\r\ngreat business operations of to-day. It is well to keep in mind that\r\nexactly as the anarchist is the worst enemy of liberty and the\r\nreactionary the worst enemy of order, so the men who defend the rights\r\nof property have most to fear from the wrongdoers of great wealth, and\r\nthe men who are championing popular rights have most to fear from the\r\ndemagogues who in the name of popular rights would do wrong to and\r\noppress honest business men, honest men of wealth; for the success of\r\neither type of wrongdoer necessarily invites a violent reaction against\r\nthe cause the wrongdoer nominally upholds. In point of danger to the\r\nNation there is nothing to choose between on the one hand the\r\ncorruptionist, the bribe-giver, the bribe-taker, the man who employs\r\nhis great talent to swindle his fellow-citizens on a large scale, and,\r\non the other hand, the preacher of class hatred, the man who, whether\r\nfrom ignorance or from willingness to sacrifice his country to his\r\nambition, persuades well-meaning but wrong-headed men to try to destroy\r\nthe instruments upon which our prosperity mainly rests. Let each group\r\nof men beware of and guard against the shortcomings to which that group\r\nis itself most liable. Too often we see the business community in a\r\nspirit of unhealthy class consciousness deplore the effort to hold to\r\naccount under the law the wealthy men who in their management of great\r\ncorporations, whether railroads, street railways, or other industrial\r\nenterprises, have behaved in a way that revolts the conscience of the\r\nplain, decent people. Such an attitude can not be condemned too\r\nseverely, for men of property should recognize that they jeopardize the\r\nrights of property when they fail heartily to join in the effort to do\r\naway with the abuses of wealth. On the other hand, those who advocate\r\nproper control on behalf of the public, through the State, of these\r\ngreat corporations, and of the wealth engaged on a giant scale in\r\nbusiness operations, must ever keep in mind that unless they do\r\nscrupulous justice to the corporation, unless they permit ample profit,\r\nand cordially encourage capable men of business so long as they act\r\nwith honesty, they are striking at the root of our national well-being;\r\nfor in the long run, under the mere pressure of material distress, the\r\npeople as a whole would probably go back to the reign of an\r\nunrestricted individualism rather than submit to a control by the State\r\nso drastic and so foolish, conceived in a spirit of such unreasonable\r\nand narrow hostility to wealth, as to prevent business operations from\r\nbeing profitable, and therefore to bring ruin upon the entire business\r\ncommunity, and ultimately upon the entire body of citizens.\r\n\r\nThe opposition to Government control of these great corporations makes\r\nits most effective effort in the shape of an appeal to the old doctrine\r\nof State's rights. Of course there are many sincere men who now believe\r\nin unrestricted individualism in business, just as there were formerly\r\nmany sincere men who believed in slavery--that is, in the unrestricted\r\nright of an individual to own another individual. These men do not by\r\nthemselves have great weight, however. The effective fight against\r\nadequate Government control and supervision of individual, and\r\nespecially of corporate, wealth engaged in interstate business is\r\nchiefly done under cover; and especially under cover of an appeal to\r\nState's rights. It is not at all infrequent to read in the same speech\r\na denunciation of predatory wealth fostered by special privilege and\r\ndefiant of both the public welfare and law of the land, and a\r\ndenunciation of centralization in the Central Government of the power\r\nto deal with this centralized and organized wealth. Of course the\r\npolicy set forth in such twin denunciations amounts to absolutely\r\nnothing, for the first half is nullified by the second half. The chief\r\nreason, among the many sound and compelling reasons, that led to the\r\nformation of the National Government was the absolute need that the\r\nUnion, and not the several States, should deal with interstate and\r\nforeign commerce; and the power to deal with interstate commerce was\r\ngranted absolutely and plenarily to the Central Government and was\r\nexercised completely as regards the only instruments of interstate\r\ncommerce known in those days--the waterways, the highroads, as well as\r\nthe partnerships of individuals who then conducted all of what business\r\nthere was. Interstate commerce is now chiefly conducted by railroads;\r\nand the great corporation has supplanted the mass of small partnerships\r\nor individuals. The proposal to make the National Government supreme\r\nover, and therefore to give it complete control over, the railroads and\r\nother instruments of interstate commerce is merely a proposal to carry\r\nout to the letter one of the prime purposes, if not the prime purpose,\r\nfor which the Constitution was rounded. It does not represent\r\ncentralization. It represents merely the acknowledgment of the patent\r\nfact that centralization has already come in business. If this\r\nirresponsible outside business power is to be controlled in the\r\ninterest of the general public it can only be controlled in one way--by\r\ngiving adequate power of control to the one sovereignty capable of\r\nexercising such power--the National Government. Forty or fifty separate\r\nstate governments can not exercise that power over corporations doing\r\nbusiness in most or all of them; first, because they absolutely lack\r\nthe authority to deal with interstate business in any form; and second,\r\nbecause of the inevitable conflict of authority sure to arise in the\r\neffort to enforce different kinds of state regulation, often\r\ninconsistent with one another and sometimes oppressive in themselves.\r\nSuch divided authority can not regulate commerce with wisdom and\r\neffect. The Central Government is the only power which, without\r\noppression, can nevertheless thoroughly and adequately control and\r\nsupervise the large corporations. To abandon the effort for National\r\ncontrol means to abandon the effort for all adequate control and yet to\r\nrender likely continual bursts of action by State legislatures, which\r\ncan not achieve the purpose sought for, but which can do a great deal\r\nof damage to the corporation without conferring any real benefit on the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nI believe that the more farsighted corporations are themselves coming\r\nto recognize the unwisdom of the violent hostility they have displayed\r\nduring the last few years to regulation and control by the National\r\nGovernment of combinations engaged in interstate business. The truth is\r\nthat we who believe in this movement of asserting and exercising a\r\ngenuine control, in the public interest, over these great corporations\r\nhave to contend against two sets of enemies, who, though nominally\r\nopposed to one another, are really allies in preventing a proper\r\nsolution of the problem. There are, first, the big corporation men, and\r\nthe extreme individualists among business men, who genuinely believe in\r\nutterly unregulated business that is, in the reign of plutocracy; and,\r\nsecond, the men who, being blind to the economic movements of the day,\r\nbelieve in a movement of repression rather than of regulation of\r\ncorporations, and who denounce both the power of the railroads and the\r\nexercise of the Federal power which alone can really control the\r\nrailroads. Those who believe in efficient national control, on the\r\nother hand, do not in the least object to combinations; do not in the\r\nleast object to concentration in business administration. On the\r\ncontrary, they favor both, with the all important proviso that there\r\nshall be such publicity about their workings, and such thoroughgoing\r\ncontrol over them, as to insure their being in the interest, and not\r\nagainst the interest, of the general public. We do not object to the\r\nconcentration of wealth and administration; but we do believe in the\r\ndistribution of the wealth in profits to the real owners, and in\r\nsecuring to the public the full benefit of the concentrated\r\nadministration. We believe that with concentration in administration\r\nthere can come both be advantage of a larger ownership and of a more\r\nequitable distribution of profits, and at the same time a better\r\nservice to the commonwealth. We believe that the administration should\r\nbe for the benefit of the many; and that greed and rascality, practiced\r\non a large scale, should be punished as relentlessly as if practiced on\r\na small scale.\r\n\r\nWe do not for a moment believe that the problem will be solved by any\r\nshort and easy method. The solution will come only by pressing various\r\nconcurrent remedies. Some of these remedies must lie outside the domain\r\nof all government. Some must lie outside the domain of the Federal\r\nGovernment. But there is legislation which the Federal Government alone\r\ncan enact and which is absolutely vital in order to secure the\r\nattainment of our purpose. Many laws are needed. There should be\r\nregulation by the National Government of the great interstate\r\ncorporations, including a simple method of account keeping, publicity,\r\nsupervision of the issue securities, abolition of rebates, and of\r\nspecial privileges. There should be short time franchises for all\r\ncorporations engaged in public business; including the corporations\r\nwhich get power from water rights. There should be National as well as\r\nState guardianship of mines and forests. The labor legislation\r\nhereinafter referred to should concurrently be enacted into law.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, means of course a certain increase in the use\r\nof--not the creation of--power, by the Central Government. The power\r\nalready exists; it does not have to be created; the only question is\r\nwhether it shall be used or left idle--and meanwhile the corporations\r\nover which the power ought to be exercised will not remain idle. Let\r\nthose who object to this increase in the use of the only power\r\navailable, the national power, be frank, and admit openly that they\r\npropose to abandon any effort to control the great business\r\ncorporations and to exercise supervision over the accumulation and\r\ndistribution of wealth; for such supervision and control can only come\r\nthrough this particular kind of increase of power. We no more believe\r\nin that empiricism which demand, absolutely unrestrained individualism\r\nthan we do in that empiricism which clamors for a deadening socialism\r\nwhich would destroy all individual initiative and would ruin the\r\ncountry with a completeness that not even an unrestrained individualism\r\nitself could achieve. The danger to American democracy lies not in the\r\nleast in the concentration of administrative power in responsible and\r\naccountable hands. It lies in having the power insufficiently\r\nconcentrated, so that no one can be held responsible to the people for\r\nits use. Concentrated power is palpable, visible, responsible, easily\r\nreached, quickly held to account. Power scattered through many\r\nadministrators, many legislators, many men who work behind and through\r\nlegislators and administrators, is impalpable, is unseen, is\r\nirresponsible, can not be reached, can not be held to account.\r\nDemocracy is in peril wherever the administration of political power is\r\nscattered among a variety of men who work in secret, whose very names\r\nare unknown to the common people. It is not in peril from any man who\r\nderives authority from the people, who exercises it in sight of the\r\npeople, and who is from time to time compelled to give an account of\r\nits exercise to the people.\r\n\r\nLABOR.\r\n\r\nThere are many matters affecting labor and the status of the\r\nwage-worker to which I should like to draw your attention, but an\r\nexhaustive discussion of the problem in all its aspects is not now\r\nnecessary. This administration is nearing its end; and, moreover, under\r\nour form of government the solution of the problem depends upon the\r\naction of the States as much as upon the action of the Nation.\r\nNevertheless, there are certain considerations which I wish to set\r\nbefore you, because I hope that our people will more and more keep them\r\nin mind. A blind and ignorant resistance to every effort for the reform\r\nof abuses and for the readjustment of society to modern industrial\r\nconditions represents not true conservatism, but an incitement to the\r\nwildest radicalism; for wise radicalism and wise conservatism go hand\r\nin hand, one bent on progress, the other bent on seeing that no change\r\nis made unless in the right direction. I believe in a steady effort, or\r\nperhaps it would be more accurate to say in steady efforts in many\r\ndifferent directions, to bring about a condition of affairs under which\r\nthe men who work with hand or with brain, the laborers, the\r\nsuperintendents, the men who produce for the market and the men who\r\nfind a market for the articles produced, shall own a far greater share\r\nthan at present of the wealth they produce, and be enabled to invest it\r\nin the tools and instruments by which all work is carried on. As far as\r\npossible I hope to see a frank recognition of the advantages conferred\r\nby machinery, organization, and division of labor, accompanied by an\r\neffort to bring about a larger share in the ownership by wage-worker of\r\nrailway, mill and factory. In farming, this simply means that we wish\r\nto see the farmer own his own land; we do not wish to see the farms so\r\nlarge that they become the property of absentee landlords who farm them\r\nby tenants, nor yet so small that the farmer becomes like a European\r\npeasant. Again, the depositors in our savings banks now number over\r\none-tenth of our entire population. These are all capitalists, who\r\nthrough the savings banks loan their money to the workers--that is, in\r\nmany cases to themselves--to carry on their various industries. The\r\nmore we increase their number, the more we introduce the principles of\r\ncooperation into our industry. Every increase in the number of small\r\nstockholders in corporations is a good thing, for the same reasons; and\r\nwhere the employees are the stockholders the result is particularly\r\ngood. Very much of this movement must be outside of anything that can\r\nbe accomplished by legislation; but legislation can do a good deal.\r\nPostal savings banks will make it easy for the poorest to keep their\r\nsavings in absolute safety. The regulation of the national highways\r\nmust be such that they shall serve all people with equal justice.\r\nCorporate finances must be supervised so as to make it far safer than\r\nat present for the man of small means to invest his money in stocks.\r\nThere must be prohibition of child labor, diminution of woman labor,\r\nshortening of hours of all mechanical labor; stock watering should be\r\nprohibited, and stock gambling so far as is possible discouraged. There\r\nshould be a progressive inheritance tax on large fortunes. Industrial\r\neducation should be encouraged. As far as possible we should lighten\r\nthe burden of taxation on the small man. We should put a premium upon\r\nthrift, hard work, and business energy; but these qualities cease to be\r\nthe main factors in accumulating a fortune long before that fortune\r\nreaches a point where it would be seriously affected by any inheritance\r\ntax such as I propose. It is eminently right that the Nation should fix\r\nthe terms upon which the great fortunes are inherited. They rarely do\r\ngood and they often do harm to those who inherit them in their\r\nentirety.\r\n\r\nPROTECTION FOR WAGEWORKERS.\r\n\r\nThe above is the merest sketch, hardly even a sketch in outline, of the\r\nreforms for which we should work. But there is one matter with which\r\nthe Congress should deal at this session. There should no longer be any\r\npaltering with the question of taking care of the wage-workers who,\r\nunder our present industrial system, become killed, crippled, or worn\r\nout as part of the regular incidents of a given business. The majority\r\nof wageworkers must have their rights secured for them by State action;\r\nbut the National Government should legislate in thoroughgoing and\r\nfar-reaching fashion not only for all employees of the National\r\nGovernment, but for all persons engaged in interstate commerce. The\r\nobject sought for could be achieved to a measurable degree, as far as\r\nthose killed or crippled are concerned, by proper employers' liability\r\nlaws. As far as concerns those who have been worn out, I call your\r\nattention to the fact that definite steps toward providing old-age\r\npensions have been taken in many of our private industries. These may\r\nbe indefinitely extended through voluntary association and contributory\r\nschemes, or through the agency of savings banks, as under the recent\r\nMassachusetts plan. To strengthen these practical measures should be\r\nour immediate duty; it is not at present necessary to consider the\r\nlarger and more general governmental schemes that most European\r\ngovernments have found themselves obliged to adopt.\r\n\r\nOur present system, or rather no system, works dreadful wrong, and is\r\nof benefit to only one class of people--the lawyers. When a workman is\r\ninjured what he needs is not an expensive and doubtful lawsuit, but the\r\ncertainty of relief through immediate administrative action. The number\r\nof accidents which result in the death or crippling of wageworkers, in\r\nthe Union at large, is simply appalling; in a very few years it runs up\r\na total far in excess of the aggregate of the dead and wounded in any\r\nmodern war. No academic theory about \"freedom of contract\" or\r\n\"constitutional liberty to contract\" should be permitted to interfere\r\nwith this and similar movements. Progress in civilization has\r\neverywhere meant a limitation and regulation of contract. I call your\r\nespecial attention to the bulletin of the Bureau of Labor which gives a\r\nstatement of the methods of treating the unemployed in European\r\ncountries, as this is a subject which in Germany, for instance, is\r\ntreated in connection with making provision for worn-out and crippled\r\nworkmen.\r\n\r\nPending a thoroughgoing investigation and action there is certain\r\nlegislation which should be enacted at once. The law, passed at the\r\nlast session of the Congress, granting compensation to certain classes\r\nof employees of the Government, should be extended to include all\r\nemployees of the Government and should be made more liberal in its\r\nterms. There is no good ground for the distinction made in the law\r\nbetween those engaged in hazardous occupations and those not so\r\nengaged. If a man is injured or killed in any line of work, it was\r\nhazardous in his case. Whether 1 per cent or 10 per cent of those\r\nfollowing a given occupation actually suffer injury or death ought not\r\nto have any bearing on the question of their receiving compensation. It\r\nis a grim logic which says to an injured employee or to the dependents\r\nof one killed that he or they are entitled to no compensation because\r\nvery few people other than he have been injured or killed in that\r\noccupation. Perhaps one of the most striking omissions in the law is\r\nthat it does not embrace peace officers and others whose lives may be\r\nsacrificed in enforcing the laws of the United States. The terms of the\r\nact providing compensation should be made more liberal than in the\r\npresent act. A year's compensation is not adequate for a wage-earner's\r\nfamily in the event of his death by accident in the course of his\r\nemployment. And in the event of death occurring, say, ten or eleven\r\nmonths after the accident, the family would only receive as\r\ncompensation the equivalent of one or two months' earnings. In this\r\nrespect the generosity of the United States towards its employees\r\ncompares most unfavorably with that of every country in Europe--even\r\nthe poorest.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the act are also a hardship in prohibiting payment in\r\ncases where the accident is in any way due to the negligence of the\r\nemployee. It is inevitable that daily familiarity with danger will lead\r\nmen to take chances that can be construed into negligence. So well is\r\nthis recognized that in practically all countries in the civilized\r\nworld, except the United States, only a great degree of negligence acts\r\nas a bar to securing compensation. Probably in no other respect is our\r\nlegislation, both State and National, so far behind practically the\r\nentire civilized world as in the matter of liability and compensation\r\nfor accidents in industry. It is humiliating that at European\r\ninternational congresses on accidents the United States should be\r\nsingled out as the most belated among the nations in respect to\r\nemployers' liability legislation. This Government is itself a large\r\nemployer of labor, and in its dealings with its employees it should set\r\na standard in this country which would place it on a par with the most\r\nprogressive countries in Europe. The laws of the United States in this\r\nrespect and the laws of European countries have been summarized in a\r\nrecent Bulletin of the Bureau of Labor, and no American who reads this\r\nsummary can fail to be struck by the great contrast between our\r\npractices and theirs--a contrast not in any sense to our credit.\r\n\r\nThe Congress should without further delay pass a model employers'\r\nliability law for the District of Columbia. The employers' liability\r\nact recently declared unconstitutional, on account of apparently\r\nincluding in its provisions employees engaged in intrastate commerce as\r\nwell as those engaged in interstate commerce, has been held by the\r\nlocal courts to be still in effect so far as its provisions apply to\r\nDistrict of Columbia. There should be no ambiguity on this point. If\r\nthere is any doubt on the subject, the law should be reenacted with\r\nspecial reference to the District of Columbia. This act, however,\r\napplies only to employees of common carriers. In all other occupations\r\nthe liability law of the District is the old common law. The severity\r\nand injustice of the common law in this matter has been in some degree\r\nor another modified in the majority of our States, and the only\r\njurisdiction under the exclusive control of the Congress should be\r\nahead and not behind the States of the Union in this respect. A\r\ncomprehensive employers' liability law should be passed for the\r\nDistrict of Columbia.\r\n\r\nI renew my recommendation made in a previous message that half-holidays\r\nbe granted during summer to all wageworkers in Government employ.\r\n\r\nI also renew my recommendation that the principle of the eight-hour day\r\nshould as rapidly and as far as practicable be extended to the entire\r\nwork being carried on by the Government; the present law should be\r\namended to embrace contracts on those public works which the present\r\nwording of the act seems to exclude.\r\n\r\nTHE COURTS.\r\n\r\nI most earnestly urge upon the Congress the duty of increasing the\r\ntotally inadequate salaries now given to our Judges. On the whole there\r\nis no body of public servants who do as valuable work, nor whose\r\nmoneyed reward is so inadequate compared to their work. Beginning with\r\nthe Supreme Court, the Judges should have their salaries doubled. It is\r\nnot befitting the dignity of the Nation that its most honored public\r\nservants should be paid sums so small compared to what they would earn\r\nin private life that the performance of public service by them implies\r\nan exceedingly heavy pecuniary sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIt is earnestly to be desired that some method should be devised for\r\ndoing away with the long delays which now obtain in the administration\r\nof justice, and which operate with peculiar severity against persons of\r\nsmall means, and favor only the very criminals whom it is most\r\ndesirable to punish. These long delays in the final decisions of cases\r\nmake in the aggregate a crying evil; and a remedy should be devised.\r\nMuch of this intolerable delay is due to improper regard paid to\r\ntechnicalities which are a mere hindrance to justice. In some noted\r\nrecent cases this over-regard for technicalities has resulted in a\r\nstriking denial of justice, and flagrant wrong to the body politic.\r\n\r\nAt the last election certain leaders of organized labor made a violent\r\nand sweeping attack upon the entire judiciary of the country, an attack\r\ncouched in such terms as to include the most upright, honest and\r\nbroad-minded judges, no less than those of narrower mind and more\r\nrestricted outlook. It was the kind of attack admirably fitted to\r\nprevent any successful attempt to reform abuses of the judiciary,\r\nbecause it gave the champions of the unjust judge their eagerly desired\r\nopportunity to shift their ground into a championship of just judges\r\nwho were unjustly assailed. Last year, before the House Committee on\r\nthe Judiciary, these same labor leaders formulated their demands,\r\nspecifying the bill that contained them, refusing all compromise,\r\nstating they wished the principle of that bill or nothing. They\r\ninsisted on a provision that in a labor dispute no injunction should\r\nissue except to protect a property right, and specifically provided\r\nthat the right to carry on business should not be construed as a\r\nproperty right; and in a second provision their bill made legal in a\r\nlabor dispute any act or agreement by or between two or more persons\r\nthat would not have been unlawful if done by a single person. In other\r\nwords, this bill legalized blacklisting and boycotting in every form,\r\nlegalizing, for instance, those forms of the secondary boycott which\r\nthe anthracite coal strike commission so unreservedly condemned; while\r\nthe right to carry on a business was explicitly taken out from under\r\nthat protection which the law throws over property. The demand was made\r\nthat there should be trial by jury in contempt cases, thereby most\r\nseriously impairing the authority of the courts. All this represented a\r\ncourse of policy which, if carried out, would mean the enthronement of\r\nclass privilege in its crudest and most brutal form, and the\r\ndestruction of one of the most essential functions of the judiciary in\r\nall civilized lands.\r\n\r\nThe violence of the crusade for this legislation, and its complete\r\nfailure, illustrate two truths which it is essential our people should\r\nlearn. In the first place, they ought to teach the workingman, the\r\nlaborer, the wageworker, that by demanding what is improper and\r\nimpossible he plays into the hands of his foes. Such a crude and\r\nvicious attack upon the courts, even if it were temporarily successful,\r\nwould inevitably in the end cause a violent reaction and would band the\r\ngreat mass of citizens together, forcing them to stand by all the\r\njudges, competent and incompetent alike, rather than to see the wheels\r\nof justice stopped. A movement of this kind can ultimately result in\r\nnothing but damage to those in whose behalf it is nominally undertaken.\r\nThis is a most healthy truth, which it is wise for all our people to\r\nlearn. Any movement based on that class hatred which at times assumes\r\nthe name of \"class consciousness\" is certain ultimately to fail, and if\r\nit temporarily succeeds, to do far-reaching damage. \"Class\r\nconsciousness,\" where it is merely another name for the odious vice of\r\nclass selfishness, is equally noxious whether in an employer's\r\nassociation or in a workingman's association. The movement in question\r\nwas one in which the appeal was made to all workingmen to vote\r\nprimarily, not as American citizens, but as individuals of a certain\r\nclass in society. Such an appeal in the first place revolts the more\r\nhigh-minded and far-sighted among the persons to whom it is addressed,\r\nand in the second place tends to arouse a strong antagonism among all\r\nother classes of citizens, whom it therefore tends to unite against the\r\nvery organization on whose behalf it is issued. The result is therefore\r\nunfortunate from every standpoint. This healthy truth, by the way, will\r\nbe learned by the socialists if they ever succeed in establishing in\r\nthis country an important national party based on such class\r\nconsciousness and selfish class interest.\r\n\r\nThe wageworkers, the workingmen, the laboring men of the country, by\r\nthe way in which they repudiated the effort to get them to cast their\r\nvotes in response to an appeal to class hatred, have emphasized their\r\nsound patriotism and Americanism. The whole country has cause to fell\r\npride in this attitude of sturdy independence, in this uncompromising\r\ninsistence upon acting simply as good citizens, as good Americans,\r\nwithout regard to fancied--and improper--class interests. Such an\r\nattitude is an object-lesson in good citizenship to the entire nation.\r\n\r\nBut the extreme reactionaries, the persons who blind themselves to the\r\nwrongs now and then committed by the courts on laboring men, should\r\nalso think seriously as to what such a movement as this portends. The\r\njudges who have shown themselves able and willing effectively to check\r\nthe dishonest activity of the very rich man who works iniquity by the\r\nmismanagement of corporations, who have shown themselves alert to do\r\njustice to the wageworker, and sympathetic with the needs of the mass\r\nof our people, so that the dweller in the tenement houses, the man who\r\npractices a dangerous trade, the man who is crushed by excessive hours\r\nof labor, feel that their needs are understood by the courts--these\r\njudges are the real bulwark of the courts; these judges, the judges of\r\nthe stamp of the president-elect, who have been fearless in opposing\r\nlabor when it has gone wrong, but fearless also in holding to strict\r\naccount corporations that work iniquity, and far-sighted in seeing that\r\nthe workingman gets his rights, are the men of all others to whom we\r\nowe it that the appeal for such violent and mistaken legislation has\r\nfallen on deaf ears, that the agitation for its passage proved to be\r\nwithout substantial basis. The courts are jeopardized primarily by the\r\naction of those Federal and State judges who show inability or\r\nunwillingness to put a stop to the wrongdoing of very rich men under\r\nmodern industrial conditions, and inability or unwillingness to give\r\nrelief to men of small means or wageworkers who are crushed down by\r\nthese modern industrial conditions; who, in other words, fail to\r\nunderstand and apply the needed remedies for the new wrongs produced by\r\nthe new and highly complex social and industrial civilization which has\r\ngrown up in the last half century.\r\n\r\nThe rapid changes in our social and industrial life which have attended\r\nthis rapid growth have made it necessary that, in applying to concrete\r\ncases the great rule of right laid down in our Constitution, there\r\nshould be a full understanding and appreciation of the new conditions\r\nto which the rules are to be applied. What would have been an\r\ninfringement upon liberty half a century ago may be the necessary\r\nsafeguard of liberty to-day. What would have been an injury to property\r\nthen may be necessary to the enjoyment of property now. Every judicial\r\ndecision involves two terms--one, as interpretation of the law; the\r\nother, the understanding of the facts to which it is to be applied. The\r\ngreat mass of our judicial officers are, I believe, alive to those\r\nchanges of conditions which so materially affect the performance of\r\ntheir judicial duties. Our judicial system is sound and effective at\r\ncore, and it remains, and must ever be maintained, as the safeguard of\r\nthose principles of liberty and justice which stand at the foundation\r\nof American institutions; for, as Burke finely said, when liberty and\r\njustice are separated, neither is safe. There are, however, some\r\nmembers of the judicial body who have lagged behind in their\r\nunderstanding of these great and vital changes in the body politic,\r\nwhose minds have never been opened to the new applications of the old\r\nprinciples made necessary by the new conditions. Judges of this stamp\r\ndo lasting harm by their decisions, because they convince poor men in\r\nneed of protection that the courts of the land are profoundly ignorant\r\nof and out of sympathy with their needs, and profoundly indifferent or\r\nhostile to any proposed remedy. To such men it seems a cruel mockery to\r\nhave any court decide against them on the ground that it desires to\r\npreserve \"liberty\" in a purely technical form, by withholding liberty\r\nin any real and constructive sense. It is desirable that the\r\nlegislative body should possess, and wherever necessary exercise, the\r\npower to determine whether in a given case employers and employees are\r\nnot on an equal footing, so that the necessities of the latter compel\r\nthem to submit to such exactions as to hours and conditions of labor as\r\nunduly to tax their strength; and only mischief can result when such\r\ndetermination is upset on the ground that there must be no\r\n\"interference with the liberty to contract\"--often a merely academic\r\n\"liberty,\" the exercise of which is the negation of real liberty.\r\n\r\nThere are certain decisions by various courts which have been\r\nexceedingly detrimental to the rights of wageworkers. This is true of\r\nall the decisions that decide that men and women are, by the\r\nConstitution, \"guaranteed their liberty\" to contract to enter a\r\ndangerous occupation, or to work an undesirable or improper number of\r\nhours, or to work in unhealthy surroundings; and therefore can not\r\nrecover damages when maimed in that occupation and can not be forbidden\r\nto work what the legislature decides is an excessive number of hours,\r\nor to carry on the work under conditions which the legislature decides\r\nto be unhealthy. The most dangerous occupations are often the poorest\r\npaid and those where the hours of work are longest; and in many cases\r\nthose who go into them are driven by necessity so great that they have\r\npractically no alternative. Decisions such as those alluded to above\r\nnullify the legislative effort to protect the wage-workers who most\r\nneed protection from those employers who take advantage of their\r\ngrinding need. They halt or hamper the movement for securing better and\r\nmore equitable conditions of labor. The talk about preserving to the\r\nmisery-hunted beings who make contracts for such service their\r\n\"liberty\" to make them, is either to speak in a spirit of heartless\r\nirony or else to show an utter lack of knowledge of the conditions of\r\nlife among the great masses of our fellow-countrymen, a lack which\r\nunfits a judge to do good service just as it would unfit any executive\r\nor legislative officer.\r\n\r\nThere is also, I think, ground for the belief that substantial\r\ninjustice is often suffered by employees in consequence of the custom\r\nof courts issuing temporary injunctions without notice to them, and\r\npunishing them for contempt of court in instances where, as a matter of\r\nfact, they have no knowledge of any proceedings. Outside of organized\r\nlabor there is a widespread feeling that this system often works great\r\ninjustice to wageworkers when their efforts to better their working\r\ncondition result in industrial disputes. A temporary injunction\r\nprocured ex parte may as a matter of fact have all the effect of a\r\npermanent injunction in causing disaster to the wageworkers' side in\r\nsuch a dispute. Organized labor is chafing under the unjust restraint\r\nwhich comes from repeated resort to this plan of procedure. Its\r\ndiscontent has been unwisely expressed, and often improperly expressed,\r\nbut there is a sound basis for it, and the orderly and law-abiding\r\npeople of a community would be in a far stronger position for upholding\r\nthe courts if the undoubtedly existing abuses could be provided\r\nagainst.\r\n\r\nSuch proposals as those mentioned above as advocated by the extreme\r\nlabor leaders contain the vital error of being class legislation of the\r\nmost offensive kind, and even if enacted into law I believe that the\r\nlaw would rightly be held unconstitutional. Moreover, the labor people\r\nare themselves now beginning to invoke the use of the power of\r\ninjunction. During the last ten years, and within my own knowledge, at\r\nleast fifty injunctions have been obtained by labor unions in New York\r\nCity alone, most of them being to protect the union label (a \"property\r\nright\"), but some being obtained for other reasons against employers.\r\nThe power of injunction is a great equitable remedy, which should on no\r\naccount be destroyed. But safeguards should be erected against its\r\nabuse. I believe that some such provisions as those I advocated a year\r\nago for checking the abuse of the issuance of temporary injunctions\r\nshould be adopted. In substance, provision should be made that no\r\ninjunction or temporary restraining order issue otherwise than on\r\nnotice, except where irreparable injury would otherwise result; and in\r\nsuch case a hearing on the merits of the order should be had within a\r\nshort fixed period, and, if not then continued after hearing, it should\r\nforthwith lapse. Decisions should be rendered immediately, and the\r\nchance of delay minimized in every way. Moreover, I believe that the\r\nprocedure should be sharply defined, and the judge required minutely to\r\nstate the particulars both of his action and of his reasons therefor,\r\nso that the Congress can, if it desires, examine and investigate the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nThe chief lawmakers in our country may be, and often are, the judges,\r\nbecause they are the final seat of authority. Every time they interpret\r\ncontract, property, vested rights, due process of law, liberty, they\r\nnecessarily enact into law parts of a system of social philosophy, and\r\nas such interpretation is fundamental, they give direction to all\r\nlaw-making. The decisions of the courts on economic and social\r\nquestions depend upon their economic and social philosophy; and for the\r\npeaceful progress of our people during the twentieth century we shall\r\nowe most to those judges who hold to a twentieth century economic and\r\nsocial philosophy and not to a long outgrown philosophy, which was\r\nitself the product of primitive economic conditions. Of course a\r\njudge's views on progressive social philosophy are entirely second in\r\nimportance to his possession of a high and fine character; which means\r\nthe possession of such elementary virtues as honesty, courage, and\r\nfair-mindedness. The judge who owes his election to pandering to\r\ndemagogic sentiments or class hatreds and prejudices, and the judge who\r\nowes either his election or his appointment to the money or the favor\r\nof a great corporation, are alike unworthy to sit on the bench, are\r\nalike traitors to the people; and no profundity of legal learning, or\r\ncorrectness of abstract conviction on questions of public policy, can\r\nserve as an offset to such shortcomings. But it is also true that\r\njudges, like executives and legislators, should hold sound views on the\r\nquestions of public policy which are of vital interest to the people.\r\n\r\nThe legislators and executives are chosen to represent the people in\r\nenacting and administering the laws. The judges are not chosen to\r\nrepresent the people in this sense. Their function is to interpret the\r\nlaws. The legislators are responsible for the laws; the judges for the\r\nspirit in which they interpret and enforce the laws. We stand aloof\r\nfrom the reckless agitators who would make the judges mere pliant tools\r\nof popular prejudice and passion; and we stand aloof from those equally\r\nunwise partisans of reaction and privilege who deny the proposition\r\nthat, inasmuch as judges are chosen to serve the interests of the whole\r\npeople, they should strive to find out what those interests are, and,\r\nso far as they conscientiously can, should strive to give effect to\r\npopular conviction when deliberately and duly expressed by the\r\nlawmaking body. The courts are to be highly commended and staunchly\r\nupheld when they set their faces against wrongdoing or tyranny by a\r\nmajority; but they are to be blamed when they fail to recognize under a\r\ngovernment like ours the deliberate judgment of the majority as to a\r\nmatter of legitimate policy, when duly expressed by the legislature.\r\nSuch lawfully expressed and deliberate judgment should be given effect\r\nby the courts, save in the extreme and exceptional cases where there\r\nhas been a clear violation of a constitutional provision. Anything like\r\nfrivolity or wantonness in upsetting such clearly taken governmental\r\naction is a grave offense against the Republic. To protest against\r\ntyranny, to protect minorities from oppression, to nullify an act\r\ncommitted in a spasm of popular fury, is to render a service to the\r\nRepublic. But for the courts to arrogate to themselves functions which\r\nproperly belong to the legislative bodies is all wrong, and in the end\r\nworks mischief. The people should not be permitted to pardon evil and\r\nslipshod legislation on the theory that the court will set it right;\r\nthey should be taught that the right way to get rid of a bad law is to\r\nhave the legislature repeal it, and not to have the courts by ingenious\r\nhair-splitting nullify it. A law may be unwise and improper; but it\r\nshould not for these reasons be declared unconstitutional by a strained\r\ninterpretation, for the result of such action is to take away from the\r\npeople at large their sense of responsibility and ultimately to destroy\r\ntheir capacity for orderly self restraint and self government. Under\r\nsuch a popular government as ours, rounded on the theory that in the\r\nlong run the will of the people is supreme, the ultimate safety of the\r\nNation can only rest in training and guiding the people so that what\r\nthey will shall be right, and not in devising means to defeat their\r\nwill by the technicalities of strained construction.\r\n\r\nFor many of the shortcomings of justice in our country our people as a\r\nwhole are themselves to blame, and the judges and juries merely bear\r\ntheir share together with the public as a whole. It is discreditable to\r\nus as a people that there should be difficulty in convicting murderers,\r\nor in bringing to justice men who as public servants have been guilty\r\nof corruption, or who have profited by the corruption of public\r\nservants. The result is equally unfortunate, whether due to\r\nhairsplitting technicalities in the interpretation of law by judges, to\r\nsentimentality and class consciousness on the part of juries, or to\r\nhysteria and sensationalism in the daily press. For much of this\r\nfailure of justice no responsibility whatever lies on rich men as such.\r\nWe who make up the mass of the people can not shift the responsibility\r\nfrom our own shoulders. But there is an important part of the failure\r\nwhich has specially to do with inability to hold to proper account men\r\nof wealth who behave badly.\r\n\r\nThe chief breakdown is in dealing with the new relations that arise\r\nfrom the mutualism, the interdependence of our time. Every new social\r\nrelation begets a new type of wrongdoing--of sin, to use an\r\nold-fashioned word--and many years always elapse before society is able\r\nto turn this sin into crime which can be effectively punished at law.\r\nDuring the lifetime of the older men now alive the social relations\r\nhave changed far more rapidly than in the preceding two centuries. The\r\nimmense growth of corporations, of business done by associations, and\r\nthe extreme strain and pressure of modern life, have produced\r\nconditions which render the public confused as to who its really\r\ndangerous foes are; and among the public servants who have not only\r\nshared this confusion, but by some of their acts have increased it, are\r\ncertain judges. Marked inefficiency has been shown in dealing with\r\ncorporations and in re-settling the proper attitude to be taken by the\r\npublic not only towards corporations, but towards labor and towards the\r\nsocial questions arising out of the factory system and the enormous\r\ngrowth of our great cities.\r\n\r\nThe huge wealth that has been accumulated by a few individuals of\r\nrecent years, in what has amounted to a social and industrial\r\nrevolution, has been as regards some of these individuals made possible\r\nonly by the improper use of the modern corporation. A certain type of\r\nmodern corporation, with its officers and agents, its many issues of\r\nsecurities, and its constant consolidation with allied undertakings,\r\nfinally becomes an instrument so complex as to contain a greater number\r\nof elements that, under various judicial decisions, lend themselves to\r\nfraud and oppression than any device yet evolved in the human brain.\r\nCorporations are necessary instruments of modern business. They have\r\nbeen permitted to become a menace largely because the governmental\r\nrepresentatives of the people have worked slowly in providing for\r\nadequate control over them.\r\n\r\nThe chief offender in any given case may be an executive, a\r\nlegislature, or a judge. Every executive head who advises violent,\r\ninstead of gradual, action, or who advocates ill-considered and\r\nsweeping measures of reform (especially if they are tainted with\r\nvindictiveness and disregard for the rights of the minority) is\r\nparticularly blameworthy. The several legislatures are responsible for\r\nthe fact that our laws are often prepared with slovenly haste and lack\r\nof consideration. Moreover, they are often prepared, and still more\r\nfrequently amended during passage, at the suggestion of the very\r\nparties against whom they are afterwards enforced. Our great clusters\r\nof corporations, huge trusts and fabulously wealthy multi-millionaires,\r\nemploy the very best lawyers they can obtain to pick flaws in these\r\nstatutes after their passage; but they also employ a class of secret\r\nagents who seek, under the advice of experts, to render hostile\r\nlegislation innocuous by making it unconstitutional, often through the\r\ninsertion of what appear on their face to be drastic and sweeping\r\nprovisions against the interests of the parties inspiring them; while\r\nthe demagogues, the corrupt creatures who introduce blackmailing\r\nschemes to \"strike\" corporations, and all who demand extreme, and\r\nundesirably radical, measures, show themselves to be the worst enemies\r\nof the very public whose loud-mouthed champions they profess to be. A\r\nvery striking illustration of the consequences of carelessness in the\r\npreparation of a statute was the employers' liability law of 1906. In\r\nthe cases arising under that law, four out of six courts of first\r\ninstance held it unconstitutional; six out of nine justices of the\r\nSupreme Court held that its subject-matter was within the province of\r\ncongressional action; and four of the nine justices held it valid. It\r\nwas, however, adjudged unconstitutional by a bare majority of the\r\ncourt--five to four. It was surely a very slovenly piece of work to\r\nframe the legislation in such shape as to leave the question open at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nReal damage has been done by the manifold and conflicting\r\ninterpretations of the interstate commerce law. Control over the great\r\ncorporations doing interstate business can be effective only if it is\r\nvested with full power in an administrative department, a branch of the\r\nFederal executive, carrying out a Federal law; it can never be\r\neffective if a divided responsibility is left in both the States and\r\nthe Nation; it can never be effective if left in the hands of the\r\ncourts to be decided by lawsuits.\r\n\r\nThe courts hold a place of peculiar and deserved sanctity under our\r\nform of government. Respect for the law is essential to the permanence\r\nof our institutions; and respect for the law is largely conditioned\r\nupon respect for the courts. It is an offense against the Republic to\r\nsay anything which can weaken this respect, save for the gravest reason\r\nand in the most carefully guarded manner. Our judges should be held in\r\npeculiar honor; and the duty of respectful and truthful comment and\r\ncriticism, which should be binding when we speak of anybody, should be\r\nespecially binding when we speak of them. On an average they stand\r\nabove any other servants of the community, and the greatest judges have\r\nreached the high level held by those few greatest patriots whom the\r\nwhole country delights to honor. But we must face the fact that there\r\nare wise and unwise judges, just as there are wise and unwise\r\nexecutives and legislators. When a president or a governor behaves\r\nimproperly or unwisely, the remedy is easy, for his term is short; the\r\nsame is true with the legislator, although not to the same degree, for\r\nhe is one of many who belong to some given legislative body, and it is\r\ntherefore less easy to fix his personal responsibility and hold him\r\naccountable therefor. With a judge, who, being human, is also likely to\r\nerr, but whose tenure is for life, there is no similar way of holding\r\nhim to responsibility. Under ordinary conditions the only forms of\r\npressure to which he is in any way amenable are public opinion and the\r\naction of his fellow judges. It is the last which is most immediately\r\neffective, and to which we should look for the reform of abuses. Any\r\nremedy applied from without is fraught with risk. It is far better,\r\nfrom every standpoint, that the remedy should come from within. In no\r\nother nation in the world do the courts wield such vast and\r\nfar-reaching power as in the United States. All that is necessary is\r\nthat the courts as a whole should exercise this power with the\r\nfarsighted wisdom already shown by those judges who scan the future\r\nwhile they act in the present. Let them exercise this great power not\r\nonly honestly and bravely, but with wise insight into the needs and\r\nfixed purposes of the people, so that they may do justice and work\r\nequity, so that they may protect all persons in their rights, and yet\r\nbreak down the barriers of privilege, which is the foe of right.\r\n\r\nFORESTS.\r\n\r\nIf there is any one duty which more than another we owe it to our\r\nchildren and our children's children to perform at once, it is to save\r\nthe forests of this country, for they constitute the first and most\r\nimportant element in the conservation of the natural resources of the\r\ncountry. There are of course two kinds of natural resources, One is the\r\nkind which can only be used as part of a process of exhaustion; this is\r\ntrue of mines, natural oil and gas wells, and the like. The other, and\r\nof course ultimately by far the most important, includes the resources\r\nwhich can be improved in the process of wise use; the soil, the rivers,\r\nand the forests come under this head. Any really civilized nation will\r\nso use all of these three great national assets that the nation will\r\nhave their benefit in the future. Just as a farmer, after all his life\r\nmaking his living from his farm, will, if he is an expert farmer, leave\r\nit as an asset of increased value to his son, so we should leave our\r\nnational domain to our children, increased in value and not worn out.\r\nThere are small sections of our own country, in the East and the West,\r\nin the Adriondacks, the White Mountains, and the Appalachians, and in\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, where we can already see for ourselves the damage\r\nin the shape of permanent injury to the soil and the river systems\r\nwhich comes from reckless deforestation. It matters not whether this\r\ndeforestation is due to the actual reckless cutting of timber, to the\r\nfires that inevitably follow such reckless cutting of timber, or to\r\nreckless and uncontrolled grazing, especially by the great migratory\r\nbands of sheep, the unchecked wandering of which over the country means\r\ndestruction to forests and disaster to the small home makers, the\r\nsettlers of limited means.\r\n\r\nShortsighted persons, or persons blinded to the future by desire to\r\nmake money in every way out of the present, sometimes speak as if no\r\ngreat damage would be done by the reckless destruction of our forests.\r\nIt is difficult to have patience with the arguments of these persons.\r\nThanks to our own recklessness in the use of our splendid forests, we\r\nhave already crossed the verge of a timber famine in this country, and\r\nno measures that we now take can, at least for many years, undo the\r\nmischief that has already been done. But we can prevent further\r\nmischief being done; and it would be in the highest degree\r\nreprehensible to let any consideration of temporary convenience or\r\ntemporary cost interfere with such action, especially as regards the\r\nNational Forests which the nation can now, at this very moment,\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nAll serious students of the question are aware of the great damage that\r\nhas been done in the Mediterranean countries of Europe, Asia, and\r\nAfrica by deforestation. The similar damage that has been done in\r\nEastern Asia is less well known. A recent investigation into conditions\r\nin North China by Mr. Frank N. Meyer, of the Bureau of Plant Industry\r\nof the United States Department of Agriculture, has incidentally\r\nfurnished in very striking fashion proof of the ruin that comes from\r\nreckless deforestation of mountains, and of the further fact that the\r\ndamage once done may prove practically irreparable. So important are\r\nthese investigations that I herewith attach as an appendix to my\r\nmessage certain photographs showing present conditions in China. They\r\nshow in vivid fashion the appalling desolation, taking the shape of\r\nbarren mountains and gravel and sand-covered plains, which immediately\r\nfollows and depends upon the deforestation of the mountains. Not many\r\ncenturies ago the country of northern China was one of the most fertile\r\nand beautiful spots in the entire world, and was heavily forested. We\r\nknow this not only from the old Chinese records, but from the accounts\r\ngiven by the traveler, Marco Polo. He, for instance, mentions that in\r\nvisiting the provinces of Shansi and Shensi he observed many\r\nplantations of mulberry trees. Now there is hardly a single mulberry\r\ntree in either of these provinces, and the culture of the silkworm has\r\nmoved farther south, to regions of atmospheric moisture. As an\r\nillustration of the complete change in the rivers, we may take Polo's\r\nstatement that a certain river, the Hun Ho, was so large and deep that\r\nmerchants ascended it from the sea with heavily laden boats; today this\r\nriver is simply a broad sandy bed, with shallow, rapid currents\r\nwandering hither and thither across it, absolutely unnavigable. But we\r\ndo not have to depend upon written records. The dry wells, and the\r\nwells with water far below the former watermark, bear testimony to the\r\ngood days of the past and the evil days of the present. Wherever the\r\nnative vegetation has been allowed to remain, as, for instance, here\r\nand there around a sacred temple or imperial burying ground, there are\r\nstill huge trees and tangled jungle, fragments of the glorious ancient\r\nforests. The thick, matted forest growth formerly covered the mountains\r\nto their summits. All natural factors favored this dense forest growth,\r\nand as long as it was permitted to exist the plains at the foot of the\r\nmountains were among the most fertile on the globe, and the whole\r\ncountry was a garden. Not the slightest effort was made, however, to\r\nprevent the unchecked cutting of the trees, or to secure reforestation.\r\nDoubtless for many centuries the tree-cutting by the inhabitants of the\r\nmountains worked but slowly in bringing about the changes that have now\r\ncome to pass; doubtless for generations the inroads were scarcely\r\nnoticeable. But there came a time when the forest had shrunk\r\nsufficiently to make each year's cutting a serious matter, and from\r\nthat time on the destruction proceeded with appalling rapidity; for of\r\ncourse each year of destruction rendered the forest less able to\r\nrecuperate, less able to resist next year's inroad. Mr. Meyer describes\r\nthe ceaseless progress of the destruction even now, when there is so\r\nlittle left to destroy. Every morning men and boys go out armed with\r\nmattox or axe, scale the steepest mountain sides, and cut down and grub\r\nout, root and branch, the small trees and shrubs still to be found. The\r\nbig trees disappeared centuries ago, so that now one of these is never\r\nseen save in the neighborhood of temples, where they are artificially\r\nprotected; and even here it takes all the watch and care of the\r\ntree-loving priests to prevent their destruction. Each family, each\r\ncommunity, where there is no common care exercised in the interest of\r\nall of them to prevent deforestation, finds its profit in the immediate\r\nuse of the fuel which would otherwise be used by some other family or\r\nsome other community. In the total absence of regulation of the matter\r\nin the interest of the whole people, each small group is inevitably\r\npushed into a policy of destruction which can not afford to take\r\nthought for the morrow. This is just one of those matters which it is\r\nfatal to leave to unsupervised individual control. The forest can only\r\nbe protected by the State, by the Nation; and the liberty of action of\r\nindividuals must be conditioned upon what the State or Nation\r\ndetermines to be necessary for the common safety.\r\n\r\nThe lesson of deforestation in China is a lesson which mankind should\r\nhave learned many times already from what has occurred in other places.\r\nDenudation leaves naked soil; then gullying cuts down to the bare rock;\r\nand meanwhile the rock-waste buries the bottomlands. When the soil is\r\ngone, men must go; and the process does not take long.\r\n\r\nThis ruthless destruction of the forests in northern China has brought\r\nabout, or has aided in bringing about, desolation, just as the\r\ndestruction of the forests in central Asia aid in bringing ruin to the\r\nonce rich central Asian cities; just as the destruction of the forest\r\nin northern Africa helped towards the ruin of a region that was a\r\nfertile granary in Roman days. Shortsighted man, whether barbaric,\r\nsemi-civilized, or what he mistakenly regards as fully civilized, when\r\nhe has destroyed the forests, has rendered certain the ultimate\r\ndestruction of the land itself. In northern China the mountains are now\r\nsuch as are shown by the accompanying photographs, absolutely barren\r\npeaks. Not only have the forests been destroyed, but because of their\r\ndestruction the soil has been washed off the naked rock. The terrible\r\nconsequence is that it is impossible now to undo the damage that has\r\nbeen done. Many centuries would have to pass before soil would again\r\ncollect, or could be made to collect, in sufficient quantity once more\r\nto support the old-time forest growth. In consequence the Mongol Desert\r\nis practically extending eastward over northern China. The climate has\r\nchanged and is still changing. It has changed even within the last half\r\ncentury, as the work of tree destruction has been consummated. The\r\ngreat masses of arboreal vegetation on the mountains formerly absorbed\r\nthe heat of the sun and sent up currents of cool air which brought the\r\nmoisture-laden clouds lower and forced them to precipitate in rain a\r\npart of their burden of water. Now that there is no vegetation, the\r\nbarren mountains, scorched by the sun, send up currents of heated air\r\nwhich drive away instead of attracting the rain clouds, and cause their\r\nmoisture to be disseminated. In consequence, instead of the regular and\r\nplentiful rains which existed in these regions of China when the\r\nforests were still in evidence, the unfortunate inhabitants of the\r\ndeforested lands now see their crops wither for lack of rainfall, while\r\nthe seasons grow more and more irregular; and as the air becomes dryer\r\ncertain crops refuse longer to grow at all. That everything dries out\r\nfaster than formerly is shown by the fact that the level of the wells\r\nall over the land has sunk perceptibly, many of them having become\r\ntotally dry. In addition to the resulting agricultural distress, the\r\nwatercourses have changed. Formerly they were narrow and deep, with an\r\nabundance of clear water the year around; for the roots and humus of\r\nthe forests caught the rainwater and let it escape by slow, regular\r\nseepage. They have now become broad, shallow stream beds, in which\r\nmuddy water trickles in slender currents during the dry seasons, while\r\nwhen it rains there are freshets, and roaring muddy torrents come\r\ntearing down, bringing disaster and destruction everywhere. Moreover,\r\nthese floods and freshets, which diversify the general dryness, wash\r\naway from the mountain sides, and either wash away or cover in the\r\nvalleys, the rich fertile soil which it took tens of thousands of years\r\nfor Nature to form; and it is lost forever, and until the forests grow\r\nagain it can not be replaced. The sand and stones from the mountain\r\nsides are washed loose and come rolling down to cover the arable lands,\r\nand in consequence, throughout this part of China, many formerly rich\r\ndistricts are now sandy wastes, useless for human cultivation and even\r\nfor pasture. The cities have been of course seriously affected, for the\r\nstreams have gradually ceased to be navigable. There is testimony that\r\neven within the memory of men now living there has been a serious\r\ndiminution of the rainfall of northeastern China. The level of the\r\nSungari River in northern Manchuria has been sensibly lowered during\r\nthe last fifty years, at least partly as the result of the\r\nindiscriminate rutting of the forests forming its watershed. Almost all\r\nthe rivers of northern China have become uncontrollable, and very\r\ndangerous to the dwellers along their banks, as a direct result of the\r\ndestruction of the forests. The journey from Pekin to Jehol shows in\r\nmelancholy fashion how the soil has been washed away from whole\r\nvalleys, so that they have been converted into deserts.\r\n\r\nIn northern China this disastrous process has gone on so long and has\r\nproceeded so far that no complete remedy could be applied. There are\r\ncertain mountains in China from which the soil is gone so utterly that\r\nonly the slow action of the ages could again restore it; although of\r\ncourse much could be done to prevent the still further eastward\r\nextension of the Mongolian Desert if the Chinese Government would act\r\nat once. The accompanying cuts from photographs show the inconceivable\r\ndesolation of the barren mountains in which certain of these rivers\r\nrise--mountains, be it remembered, which formerly supported dense\r\nforests of larches and firs, now unable to produce any wood, and\r\nbecause of their condition a source of danger to the whole country. The\r\nphotographs also show the same rivers after they have passed through\r\nthe mountains, the beds having become broad and sandy because of the\r\ndeforestation of the mountains. One of the photographs shows a caravan\r\npassing through a valley. Formerly, when the mountains were forested,\r\nit was thickly peopled by prosperous peasants. Now the floods have\r\ncarried destruction all over the land and the valley is a stony desert.\r\nAnother photograph shows a mountain road covered with the stones and\r\nrocks that are brought down in the rainy season from the mountains\r\nwhich have already been deforested by human hands. Another shows a\r\npebbly river-bed in southern Manchuria where what was once a great\r\nstream has dried up owing to the deforestation in the mountains. Only\r\nsome scrub wood is left, which will disappear within a half century.\r\nYet another shows the effect of one of the washouts, destroying an\r\narable mountain side, these washouts being due to the removal of all\r\nvegetation; yet in this photograph the foreground shows that\r\nreforestation is still a possibility in places.\r\n\r\nWhat has thus happened in northern China, what has happened in Central\r\nAsia, in Palestine, in North Africa, in parts of the Mediterranean\r\ncountries of Europe, will surely happen in our country if we do not\r\nexercise that wise forethought which should be one of the chief marks\r\nof any people calling itself civilized. Nothing should be permitted to\r\nstand in the way of the preservation of the forests, and it is criminal\r\nto permit individuals to purchase a little gain for themselves through\r\nthe destruction of forests when this destruction is fatal to the\r\nwell-being of the whole country in the future.\r\n\r\nINLAND WATERWAYS.\r\n\r\nAction should be begun forthwith, during the present session of the\r\nCongress, for the improvement of our inland waterways--action which\r\nwill result in giving us not only navigable but navigated rivers. We\r\nhave spent hundreds of millions of dollars upon these waterways, yet\r\nthe traffic on nearly all of them is steadily declining. This condition\r\nis the direct result of the absence of any comprehensive and far-seeing\r\nplan of waterway improvement, Obviously we can not continue thus to\r\nexpend the revenues of the Government without return. It is poor\r\nbusiness to spend money for inland navigation unless we get it.\r\n\r\nInquiry into the condition of the Mississippi and its principal\r\ntributaries reveals very many instances of the utter waste caused by\r\nthe methods which have hitherto obtained for the so-called\r\n\"improvement\" of navigation. A striking instance is supplied by the\r\n\"improvement\" of the Ohio, which, begun in 1824, was continued under a\r\nsingle plan for half a century. In 1875 a new plan was adopted and\r\nfollowed for a quarter of a century. In 1902 still a different plan was\r\nadopted and has since been pursued at a rate which only promises a\r\nnavigable river in from twenty to one hundred years longer.\r\n\r\nSuch shortsighted, vacillating, and futile methods are accompanied by\r\ndecreasing water-borne commerce and increasing traffic congestion on\r\nland, by increasing floods, and by the waste of public money. The\r\nremedy lies in abandoning the methods which have so signally failed and\r\nadopting new ones in keeping with the needs and demands of our people.\r\n\r\nIn a report on a measure introduced at the first session of the present\r\nCongress, the Secretary of War said: \"The chief defect in the methods\r\nhitherto pursued lies in the absence of executive authority for\r\noriginating comprehensive plans covering the country or natural\r\ndivisions thereof.\" In this opinion I heartily concur. The present\r\nmethods not only fail to give us inland navigation, but they are\r\ninjurious to the army as well. What is virtually a permanent detail of\r\nthe corps of engineers to civilian duty necessarily impairs the\r\nefficiency of our military establishment. The military engineers have\r\nundoubtedly done efficient work in actual construction, but they are\r\nnecessarily unsuited by their training and traditions to take the broad\r\nview, and to gather and transmit to the Congress the commercial and\r\nindustrial information and forecasts, upon which waterway improvement\r\nmust always so largely rest. Furthermore, they have failed to grasp the\r\ngreat underlying fact that every stream is a unit from its source to\r\nits mouth, and that all its uses are interdependent. Prominent officers\r\nof the Engineer Corps have recently even gone so far as to assert in\r\nprint that waterways are not dependent upon the conservation of the\r\nforests about their headwaters. This position is opposed to all the\r\nrecent work of the scientific bureaus of the Government and to the\r\ngeneral experience of mankind. A physician who disbelieved in\r\nvaccination would not be the right man to handle an epidemic of\r\nsmallpox, nor should we leave a doctor skeptical about the transmission\r\nof yellow fever by the Stegomyia mosquito in charge of sanitation at\r\nHavana or Panama. So with the improvement of our rivers; it is no\r\nlonger wise or safe to leave this great work in the hands of men who\r\nfail to grasp the essential relations between navigation and general\r\ndevelopment and to assimilate and use the central facts about our\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nUntil the work of river improvement is undertaken in a modern way it\r\ncan not have results that will meet the needs of this modern nation.\r\nThese needs should be met without further dilly-dallying or delay. The\r\nplan which promises the best and quickest results is that of a\r\npermanent commission authorized to coordinate the work of all the\r\nGovernment departments relating to waterways, and to frame and\r\nsupervise the execution of a comprehensive plan. Under such a\r\ncommission the actual work of construction might be entrusted to the\r\nreclamation service; or to the military engineers acting with a\r\nsufficient number of civilians to continue the work in time of war; or\r\nit might be divided between the reclamation service and the corps of\r\nengineers. Funds should be provided from current revenues if it is\r\ndeemed wise--otherwise from the sale of bonds. The essential thing is\r\nthat the work should go forward under the best possible plan, and with\r\nthe least possible delay. We should have a new type of work and a new\r\norganization for planning and directing it. The time for playing with\r\nour waterways is past. The country demands results.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL PARKS.\r\n\r\nI urge that all our National parks adjacent to National forests be\r\nplaced completely under the control of the forest service of the\r\nAgricultural Department, instead of leaving them as they now are, under\r\nthe Interior Department and policed by the army. The Congress should\r\nprovide for superintendents with adequate corps of first-class civilian\r\nscouts, or rangers, and, further, place the road construction under the\r\nsuperintendent instead of leaving it with the War Department. Such a\r\nchange in park management would result in economy and avoid the\r\ndifficulties of administration which now arise from having the\r\nresponsibility of care and protection divided between different\r\ndepartments. The need for this course is peculiarly great in the\r\nYellowstone Park. This, like the Yosemite, is a great wonderland, and\r\nshould be kept as a national playground. In both, all wild things\r\nshould be protected and the scenery kept wholly unmarred.\r\n\r\nI am happy to say that I have been able to set aside in various parts\r\nof the country small, well-chosen tracts of ground to serve as\r\nsanctuaries and nurseries for wild creatures.\r\n\r\nDENATURED ALCOHOL.\r\n\r\nI had occasion in my message of May 4, 1906, to urge the passage of\r\nsome law putting alcohol, used in the arts, industries, and\r\nmanufactures, upon the free list--that is, to provide for the\r\nwithdrawal free of tax of alcohol which is to be denatured for those\r\npurposes. The law of June 7, 1906, and its amendment of March 2, 1907,\r\naccomplished what was desired in that respect, and the use of denatured\r\nalcohol, as intended, is making a fair degree of progress and is\r\nentitled to further encouragement and support from the Congress.\r\n\r\nPURE FOOD.\r\n\r\nThe pure food legislation has already worked a benefit difficult to\r\noverestimate.\r\n\r\nINDIAN SERVICE.\r\n\r\nIt has been my purpose from the beginning of my administration to take\r\nthe Indian Service completely out of the atmosphere of political\r\nactivity, and there has been steady progress toward that end. The last\r\nremaining stronghold of politics in that service was the agency system,\r\nwhich had seen its best days and was gradually falling to pieces from\r\nnatural or purely evolutionary causes, but, like all such survivals,\r\nwas decaying slowly in its later stages. It seems clear that its\r\nextinction had better be made final now, so that the ground can be\r\ncleared for larger constructive work on behalf of the Indians,\r\npreparatory to their induction into the full measure of responsible\r\ncitizenship. On November 1 only eighteen agencies were left on the\r\nroster; with two exceptions, where some legal questions seemed to stand\r\ntemporarily in the way, these have been changed to superintendencies,\r\nand their heads brought into the classified civil service.\r\n\r\nSECRET SERVICE.\r\n\r\nLast year an amendment was incorporated in the measure providing for\r\nthe Secret Service, which provided that there should be no detail from\r\nthe Secret Service and no transfer therefrom. It is not too much to say\r\nthat this amendment has been of benefit only, and could be of benefit\r\nonly, to the criminal classes. If deliberately introduced for the\r\npurpose of diminishing the effectiveness of war against crime it could\r\nnot have been better devised to this end. It forbade the practices that\r\nhad been followed to a greater or less extent by the executive heads of\r\nvarious departments for twenty years. To these practices we owe the\r\nsecuring of the evidence which enabled us to drive great lotteries out\r\nof business and secure a quarter of a million of dollars in fines from\r\ntheir promoters. These practices have enabled us to get some of the\r\nevidence indispensable in order in connection with the theft of\r\ngovernment land and government timber by great corporations and by\r\nindividuals. These practices have enabled us to get some of the\r\nevidence indispensable in order to secure the conviction of the\r\nwealthiest and most formidable criminals with whom the Government has\r\nto deal, both those operating in violation of the anti-trust law and\r\nothers. The amendment in question was of benefit to no one excepting to\r\nthese criminals, and it seriously hampers the Government in the\r\ndetection of crime and the securing of justice. Moreover, it not only\r\naffects departments outside of the Treasury, but it tends to hamper the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury himself in the effort to utilize the\r\nemployees of his department so as to best meet the requirements of the\r\npublic service. It forbids him from preventing frauds upon the customs\r\nservice, from investigating irregularities in branch mints and assay\r\noffices, and has seriously crippled him. It prevents the promotion of\r\nemployees in the Secret Service, and this further discourages good\r\neffort. In its present form the restriction operates only to the\r\nadvantage of the criminal, of the wrongdoer. The chief argument in\r\nfavor of the provision was that the Congressmen did not themselves wish\r\nto be investigated by Secret Service men. Very little of such\r\ninvestigation has been done in the past; but it is true that the work\r\nof the Secret Service agents was partly responsible for the indictment\r\nand conviction of a Senator and a Congressman for land frauds in\r\nOregon. I do not believe that it is in the public interest to protect\r\ncriminally in any branch of the public service, and exactly as we have\r\nagain and again during the past seven years prosecuted and convicted\r\nsuch criminals who were in the executive branch of the Government, so\r\nin my belief we should be given ample means to prosecute them if found\r\nin the legislative branch. But if this is not considered desirable a\r\nspecial exception could be made in the law prohibiting the use of the\r\nSecret Service force in investigating members of the Congress. It would\r\nbe far better to do this than to do what actually was done, and strive\r\nto prevent or at least to hamper effective action against criminals by\r\nthe executive branch of the Government.\r\n\r\nPOSTAL SAVINGS BANKS.\r\n\r\nI again renew my recommendation for postal savings hanks, for\r\ndepositing savings with the security of the Government behind them. The\r\nobject is to encourage thrift and economy in the wage-earner and person\r\nof moderate means. In 14 States the deposits in savings banks as\r\nreported to the Comptroller of the Currency amount to $3,590,245,402,\r\nor 98.4 per cent of the entire deposits, while in the remaining 32\r\nStates there are only $70,308,543, or 1.6 per cent, showing\r\nconclusively that there are many localities in the United States where\r\nsufficient opportunity is not given to the people to deposit their\r\nsavings. The result is that money is kept in hiding and unemployed. It\r\nis believed that in the aggregate vast sums of money would be brought\r\ninto circulation through the instrumentality of the postal savings\r\nbanks. While there are only 1,453 savings banks reporting to the\r\nComptroller there are more than 61,000 post-offices, 40,000 of which\r\nare money order offices. Postal savings banks are now in operation in\r\npractically all of the great civilized countries with the exception of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nPARCEL POST.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I commended the Postmaster-General's\r\nrecommendation for an extension of the parcel post on the rural routes.\r\nThe establishment of a local parcel post on rural routes would be to\r\nthe mutual benefit of the farmer and the country storekeeper, and it is\r\ndesirable that the routes, serving more than 15,000,000 people, should\r\nbe utilized to the fullest practicable extent. An amendment was\r\nproposed in the Senate at the last session, at the suggestion of the\r\nPostmaster-General, providing that, for the purpose of ascertaining the\r\npracticability of establishing a special local parcel post system on\r\nthe rural routes throughout the United States, the Postmaster-General\r\nbe authorized and directed to experiment and report to the Congress the\r\nresult of such experiment by establishing a special local parcel post\r\nsystem on rural delivery routes in not to exceed four counties in the\r\nUnited States for packages of fourth-class matter originating on a\r\nrural route or at the distributing post office for delivery by rural\r\ncarriers. It would seem only proper that such an experiment should be\r\ntried in order to demonstrate the practicability of the proposition,\r\nespecially as the Postmaster-General estimates that the revenue derived\r\nfrom the operation of such a system on all the rural routes would\r\namount to many million dollars.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION.\r\n\r\nThe share that the National Government should take in the broad work of\r\neducation has not received the attention and the care it rightly\r\ndeserves. The immediate responsibility for the support and improvement\r\nof our educational systems and institutions rests and should always\r\nrest with the people of the several States acting through their state\r\nand local governments, but the Nation has an opportunity in educational\r\nwork which must not be lost and a duty which should no longer be\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nThe National Bureau of Education was established more than forty years\r\nago. Its purpose is to collect and diffuse such information \"as shall\r\naid the people of the United States in the establishment and\r\nmaintenance of efficient school systems and otherwise promote the cause\r\nof education throughout the country.\" This purpose in no way conflicts\r\nwith the educational work of the States, but may be made of great\r\nadvantage to the States by giving them the fullest, most accurate, and\r\nhence the most helpful information and suggestion regarding the best\r\neducational systems. The Nation, through its broader field of\r\nactivities, its wider opportunity for obtaining information from all\r\nthe States and from foreign countries, is able to do that which not\r\neven the richest States can do, and with the distinct additional\r\nadvantage that the information thus obtained is used for the immediate\r\nbenefit of all our people.\r\n\r\nWith the limited means hitherto provided, the Bureau of Education has\r\nrendered efficient service, but the Congress has neglected to\r\nadequately supply the bureau with means to meet the educational growth\r\nof the country. The appropriations for the general work of the bureau,\r\noutside education in Alaska, for the year 1909 are but $87,500--an\r\namount less than they were ten years ago, and some of the important\r\nitems in these appropriations are less than they were thirty years ago.\r\nIt is an inexcusable waste of public money to appropriate an amount\r\nwhich is so inadequate as to make it impossible properly to do the work\r\nauthorized, and it is unfair to the great educational interests of the\r\ncountry to deprive them of the value of the results which can be\r\nobtained by proper appropriations.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend that this unfortunate state of affairs as regards\r\nthe national educational office be remedied by adequate appropriations.\r\nThis recommendation is urged by the representatives of our common\r\nschools and great state universities and the leading educators, who all\r\nunite in requesting favorable consideration and action by the Congress\r\nupon this subject.\r\n\r\nCENSUS.\r\n\r\nI strongly urge that the request of the Director of the Census in\r\nconnection with the decennial work so soon to be begun be complied with\r\nand that the appointments to the census force be placed under the civil\r\nservice law, waiving the geographical requirements as requested by the\r\nDirector of the Census. The supervisors and enumerators should not be\r\nappointed under the civil service law, for the reasons given by the\r\nDirector. I commend to the Congress the careful consideration of the\r\nadmirable report of the Director of the Census, and I trust that his\r\nrecommendations will be adopted and immediate action thereon taken.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC HEALTH.\r\n\r\nIt is highly advisable that there should be intelligent action on the\r\npart of the Nation on the question of preserving the health of the\r\ncountry. Through the practical extermination in San Francisco of\r\ndisease-bearing rodents our country has thus far escaped the bubonic\r\nplague. This is but one of the many achievements of American health\r\nofficers; and it shows what can be accomplished with a better\r\norganization than at present exists. The dangers to public health from\r\nfood adulteration and from many other sources, such as the menace to\r\nthe physical, mental and moral development of children from child\r\nlabor, should be met and overcome. There are numerous diseases, which\r\nare now known to be preventable, which are, nevertheless, not\r\nprevented. The recent International Congress on Tuberculosis has made\r\nus painfully aware of the inadequacy of American public health\r\nlegislation. This Nation can not afford to lag behind in the world-wide\r\nbattle now being waged by all civilized people with the microscopic\r\nfoes of mankind, nor ought we longer to ignore the reproach that this\r\nGovernment takes more pains to protect the lives of hogs and of cattle\r\nthan of human beings.\r\n\r\nREDISTRIBUTION OF BUREAUS.\r\n\r\nThe first legislative step to be taken is that for the concentration of\r\nthe proper bureaus into one of the existing departments. I therefore\r\nurgently recommend the passage of a bill which shall authorize a\r\nredistribution of the bureaus which shall best accomplish this end.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE.\r\n\r\nI recommend that legislation be enacted placing under the jurisdiction\r\nof the Department of Commerce and Labor the Government Printing Office.\r\nAt present this office is under the combined control, supervision, and\r\nadministrative direction of the President and of the Joint Committee on\r\nPrinting of the two Houses of the Congress. The advantage of having the\r\n4,069 employees in this office and the expenditure of the $5,761,377.57\r\nappropriated therefor supervised by an executive department is obvious,\r\ninstead of the present combined supervision.\r\n\r\nSOLDIERS' HOMES.\r\n\r\nAll Soldiers' Homes should be placed under the complete jurisdiction\r\nand control of the War Department.\r\n\r\nINDEPENDENT BUREAUS AND COMMISSIONS.\r\n\r\nEconomy and sound business policy require that all existing independent\r\nbureaus and commissions should be placed under the jurisdiction of\r\nappropriate executive departments. It is unwise from every standpoint,\r\nand results only in mischief, to have any executive work done save by\r\nthe purely executive bodies, under the control of the President; and\r\neach such executive body should be under the immediate supervision of a\r\nCabinet Minister.\r\n\r\nSTATEHOOD.\r\n\r\nI advocate the immediate admission of New Mexico and Arizona as States.\r\nThis should be done at the present session of the Congress. The people\r\nof the two Territories have made it evident by their votes that they\r\nwill not come in as one State. The only alternative is to admit them as\r\ntwo, and I trust that this will be done without delay.\r\n\r\nINTERSTATE FISHERIES.\r\n\r\nI call the attention of the Congress to the importance of the problem\r\nof the fisheries in the interstate waters. On the Great Lakes we are\r\nnow, under the very wise treaty of April 11th of this year, endeavoring\r\nto come to an international agreement for the preservation and\r\nsatisfactory use of the fisheries of these waters which can not\r\notherwise be achieved. Lake Erie, for example, has the richest fresh\r\nwater fisheries in the world; but it is now controlled by the statutes\r\nof two Nations, four States, and one Province, and in this Province by\r\ndifferent ordinances in different counties. All these political\r\ndivisions work at cross purposes, and in no case can they achieve\r\nprotection to the fisheries, on the one hand, and justice to the\r\nlocalities and individuals on the other. The case is similar in Puget\r\nSound.\r\n\r\nBut the problem is quite as pressing in the interstate waters of the\r\nUnited States. The salmon fisheries of the Columbia River are now but a\r\nfraction of what they were twenty-five years ago, and what they would\r\nbe now if the United States Government had taken complete charge of\r\nthem by intervening between Oregon and Washington. During these\r\ntwenty-five years the fishermen of each State have naturally tried to\r\ntake all they could get, and the two legislatures have never been able\r\nto agree on joint action of any kind adequate in degree for the\r\nprotection of the fisheries. At the moment the fishing on the Oregon\r\nside is practically closed, while there is no limit on the Washington\r\nside of any kind, and no one can tell what the courts will decide as to\r\nthe very statutes under which this action and non-action result.\r\nMeanwhile very few salmon reach the spawning grounds, and probably four\r\nyears hence the fisheries will amount to nothing; and this comes from a\r\nstruggle between the associated, or gill-net, fishermen on the one\r\nhand, and the owners of the fishing wheels up the river. The fisheries\r\nof the Mississippi, the Ohio, and the Potomac are also in a bad way.\r\nFor this there is no remedy except for the United States to control and\r\nlegislate for the interstate fisheries as part of the business of\r\ninterstate commerce. In this case the machinery for scientific\r\ninvestigation and for control already exists in the United States\r\nBureau of Fisheries. In this as in similar problems the obvious and\r\nsimple rule should be followed of having those matters which no\r\nparticular State can manage taken in hand by the United States;\r\nproblems which in the seesaw of conflicting State legislatures are\r\nabsolutely unsolvable are easy enough for Congress to control.\r\n\r\nFISHERIES AND FUR SEALS.\r\n\r\nThe federal statute regulating interstate traffic in game should be\r\nextended to include fish. New federal fish hatcheries should be\r\nestablished. The administration of the Alaskan fur-seal service should\r\nbe vested in the Bureau of Fisheries.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS.\r\n\r\nThis Nation's foreign policy is based on the theory that right must be\r\ndone between nations precisely as between individuals, and in our\r\nactions for the last ten years we have in this matter proven our faith\r\nby our deeds. We have behaved, and are behaving, towards other nations\r\nas in private life an honorable man would behave towards his fellows.\r\n\r\nLATIN-AMERICAN REPUBLICS.\r\n\r\nThe commercial and material progress of the twenty Latin-American\r\nRepublics is worthy of the careful attention of the Congress. No other\r\nsection of the world has shown a greater proportionate development of\r\nits foreign trade during the last ten years and none other has more\r\nspecial claims on the interest of the United States. It offers to-day\r\nprobably larger opportunities for the legitimate expansion of our\r\ncommerce than any other group of countries. These countries will want\r\nour products in greatly increased quantities, and we shall\r\ncorrespondingly need theirs. The International Bureau of the American\r\nRepublics is doing a useful work in making these nations and their\r\nresources better known to us, and in acquainting them not only with us\r\nas a people and with our purposes towards them, but with what we have\r\nto exchange for their goods. It is an international institution\r\nsupported by all the governments of the two Americas.\r\n\r\nPANAMA CANAL.\r\n\r\nThe work on the Panama Canal is being done with a speed, efficiency and\r\nentire devotion to duty which make it a model for all work of the kind.\r\nNo task of such magnitude has ever before been undertaken by any\r\nnation; and no task of the kind has ever been better performed. The men\r\non the isthmus, from Colonel Goethals and his fellow commissioners\r\nthrough the entire list of employees who are faithfully doing their\r\nduty, have won their right to the ungrudging respect and gratitude of\r\nthe American people.\r\n\r\nOCEAN MAIL LINERS.\r\n\r\nI again recommend the extension of the ocean mail act of 1891 so that\r\nsatisfactory American ocean mail lines to South America, Asia, the\r\nPhilippines, and Australasia may be established. The creation of such\r\nsteamship lines should be the natural corollary of the voyage of the\r\nbattle fleet. It should precede the opening of the Panama Canal. Even\r\nunder favorable conditions several years must elapse before such lines\r\ncan be put into operation. Accordingly I urge that the Congress act\r\npromptly where foresight already shows that action sooner or later will\r\nbe inevitable.\r\n\r\nHAWAII.\r\n\r\nI call particular attention to the Territory of Hawaii. The importance\r\nof those islands is apparent, and the need of improving their condition\r\nand developing their resources is urgent. In recent years industrial\r\nconditions upon the islands have radically changed, The importation of\r\ncoolie labor has practically ceased, and there is now developing such a\r\ndiversity in agricultural products as to make possible a change in the\r\nland conditions of the Territory, so that an opportunity may be given\r\nto the small land owner similar to that on the mainland. To aid these\r\nchanges, the National Government must provide the necessary harbor\r\nimprovements on each island, so that the agricultural products can be\r\ncarried to the markets of the world. The coastwise shipping laws should\r\nbe amended to meet the special needs of the islands, and the alien\r\ncontract labor law should be so modified in its application to Hawaii\r\nas to enable American and European labor to be brought thither.\r\n\r\nWe have begun to improve Pearl Harbor for a naval base and to provide\r\nthe necessary military fortifications for the protection of the\r\nislands, but I can not too strongly emphasize the need of\r\nappropriations for these purposes of such an amount as will within the\r\nshortest possible time make those islands practically impregnable. It\r\nis useless to develop the industrial conditions of the islands and\r\nestablish there bases of supply for our naval and merchant fleets\r\nunless we insure, as far as human ingenuity can, their safety from\r\nforeign seizure.\r\n\r\nOne thing to be remembered with all our fortifications is that it is\r\nalmost useless to make them impregnable from the sea if they are left\r\nopen to land attack. This is true even of our own coast, but it is\r\ndoubly true of our insular possessions. In Hawaii, for instance, it is\r\nworse than useless to establish a naval station unless we establish it\r\nbehind fortifications so strong that no landing force can take them\r\nsave by regular and long-continued siege operations.\r\n\r\nTHE PHILIPPINES.\r\n\r\nReal progress toward self-government is being made in the Philippine\r\nIslands. The gathering of a Philippine legislative body and Philippine\r\nassembly marks a process absolutely new in Asia, not only as regards\r\nAsiatic colonies of European powers but as regards Asiatic possessions\r\nof other Asiatic powers; and, indeed, always excepting the striking and\r\nwonderful example afforded by the great Empire of Japan, it opens an\r\nentirely new departure when compared with anything which has happened\r\namong Asiatic powers which are their own masters. Hitherto this\r\nPhilippine legislature has acted with moderation and self-restraint,\r\nand has seemed in practical fashion to realize the eternal truth that\r\nthere must always be government, and that the only way in which any\r\nbody of individuals can escape the necessity of being governed by\r\noutsiders is to show that they are able to restrain themselves, to keep\r\ndown wrongdoing and disorder. The Filipino people, through their\r\nofficials, are therefore making real steps in the direction of\r\nself-government. I hope and believe that these steps mark the beginning\r\nof a course which will continue till the Filipinos become fit to decide\r\nfor themselves whether they desire to be an independent nation. But it\r\nis well for them (and well also for those Americans who during the past\r\ndecade have done so much damage to the Filipinos by agitation for an\r\nimmediate independence for which they were totally unfit) to remember\r\nthat self-government depends, and must depend, upon the Filipinos\r\nthemselves. All we can do is to give them the opportunity to develop\r\nthe capacity for self-government. If we had followed the advice of the\r\nfoolish doctrinaires who wished us at any time during the last ten\r\nyears to turn the Filipino people adrift, we should have shirked the\r\nplainest possible duty and have inflicted a lasting wrong upon the\r\nFilipino people. We have acted in exactly the opposite spirit. We have\r\ngiven the Filipinos constitutional government--a government based upon\r\njustice--and we have shown that we have governed them for their good\r\nand not for our aggrandizement. At the present time, as during the past\r\nten years, the inexorable logic of facts shows that this government\r\nmust be supplied by us and not by them. We must be wise and generous;\r\nwe must help the Filipinos to master the difficult art of self-control,\r\nwhich is simply another name for self-government. But we can not give\r\nthem self-government save in the sense of governing them so that\r\ngradually they may, if they are able, learn to govern themselves. Under\r\nthe present system of just laws and sympathetic administration, we have\r\nevery reason to believe that they are gradually acquiring the character\r\nwhich lies at the basis of self-government, and for which, if it be\r\nlacking, no system of laws, no paper constitution, will in any wise\r\nserve as a substitute. Our people in the Philippines have achieved what\r\nmay legitimately be called a marvelous success in giving to them a\r\ngovernment which marks on the part of those in authority both the\r\nnecessary understanding of the people and the necessary purpose to\r\nserve them disinterestedly and in good faith. I trust that within a\r\ngeneration the time will arrive when the Philippines can decide for\r\nthemselves whether it is well for them to become independent, or to\r\ncontinue under the protection of a strong and disinterested power, able\r\nto guarantee to the islands order at home and protection from foreign\r\ninvasion. But no one can prophesy the exact date when it will be wise\r\nto consider independence as a fixed and definite policy. It would be\r\nworse than folly to try to set down such a date in advance, for it must\r\ndepend upon the way in which the Philippine people themselves develop\r\nthe power of self-mastery.\r\n\r\nPORTO RICO.\r\n\r\nI again recommend that American citizenship be conferred upon the\r\npeople of Porto Rico.\r\n\r\nCUBA.\r\n\r\nIn Cuba our occupancy will cease in about two months' time, the Cubans\r\nhave in orderly manner elected their own governmental authorities, and\r\nthe island will be turned over to them. Our occupation on this occasion\r\nhas lasted a little over two years, and Cuba has thriven and prospered\r\nunder it. Our earnest hope and one desire is that the people of the\r\nisland shall now govern themselves with justice, so that peace and\r\norder may be secure. We will gladly help them to this end; but I would\r\nsolemnly warn them to remember the great truth that the only way a\r\npeople can permanently avoid being governed from without is to show\r\nthat they both can and will govern themselves from within.\r\n\r\nJAPANESE EXPOSITION.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Government has postponed until 1917 the date of the great\r\ninternational exposition, the action being taken so as to insure ample\r\ntime in which to prepare to make the exposition all that it should be\r\nmade. The American commissioners have visited Japan and the\r\npostponement will merely give ampler opportunity for America to be\r\nrepresented at the exposition. Not since the first international\r\nexposition has there been one of greater importance than this will be,\r\nmarking as it does the fiftieth anniversary of the ascension to the\r\nthrone of the Emperor of Japan. The extraordinary leap to a foremost\r\nplace among the nations of the world made by Japan during this half\r\ncentury is something unparalleled in all previous history. This\r\nexposition will fitly commemorate and signalize the giant progress that\r\nhas been achieved. It is the first exposition of its kind that has ever\r\nbeen held in Asia. The United States, because of the ancient friendship\r\nbetween the two peoples, because each of us fronts on the Pacific, and\r\nbecause of the growing commercial relations between this country and\r\nAsia, takes a peculiar interest in seeing the exposition made a success\r\nin every way.\r\n\r\nI take this opportunity publicly to state my appreciation of the way in\r\nwhich in Japan, in Australia, in New Zealand, and in all the States of\r\nSouth America, the battle fleet has been received on its practice\r\nvoyage around the world. The American Government can not too strongly\r\nexpress its appreciation of the abounding and generous hospitality\r\nshown our ships in every port they visited.\r\n\r\nTHE ARMY.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Army I call attention to the fact that while our junior\r\nofficers and enlisted men stand very high, the present system of\r\npromotion by seniority results in bringing into the higher grades many\r\nmen of mediocre capacity who have but a short time to serve. No man\r\nshould regard it as his vested right to rise to the highest rank in the\r\nArmy any more than in any other profession. It is a curious and by no\r\nmeans creditable fact that there should be so often a failure on the\r\npart of the public and its representatives to understand the great\r\nneed, from the standpoint of the service and the Nation, of refusing to\r\npromote respectable, elderly incompetents. The higher places should be\r\ngiven to the most deserving men without regard to seniority; at least\r\nseniority should be treated as only one consideration. In the stress of\r\nmodern industrial competition no business firm could succeed if those\r\nresponsible for its management were chosen simply on the ground that\r\nthey were the oldest people in its employment; yet this is the course\r\nadvocated as regards the Army, and required by law for all grades\r\nexcept those of general officer. As a matter of fact, all of the best\r\nofficers in the highest ranks of the Army are those who have attained\r\ntheir present position wholly or in part by a process of selection.\r\n\r\nThe scope of retiring boards should be extended so that they could\r\nconsider general unfitness to command for any cause, in order to secure\r\na far more rigid enforcement than at present in the elimination of\r\nofficers for mental, physical or temperamental disabilities. But this\r\nplan is recommended only if the Congress does not see fit to provide\r\nwhat in my judgment is far better; that is, for selection in promotion,\r\nand for elimination for age. Officers who fail to attain a certain rank\r\nby a certain age should be retired--for instance, if a man should not\r\nattain field rank by the time he is 45 he should of course be placed on\r\nthe retired list. General officers should be selected as at present,\r\nand one-third of the other promotions should be made by selection, the\r\nselection to be made by the President or the Secretary of War from a\r\nlist of at least two candidates proposed for each vacancy by a board of\r\nofficers from the arm of the service from which the promotion is to be\r\nmade. A bill is now before the Congress having for its object to secure\r\nthe promotion of officers to various grades at reasonable ages through\r\na process of selection, by boards of officers, of the least efficient\r\nfor retirement with a percentage of their pay depending upon length of\r\nservice. The bill, although not accomplishing all that should be done,\r\nis a long step in the right direction; and I earnestly recommend its\r\npassage, or that of a more completely effective measure.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry arm should be reorganized upon modern lines. This is an arm\r\nin which it is peculiarly necessary that the field officers should not\r\nbe old. The cavalry is much more difficult to form than infantry, and\r\nit should be kept up to the maximum both in efficiency and in strength,\r\nfor it can not be made in a hurry. At present both infantry and\r\nartillery are too few in number for our needs. Especial attention\r\nshould be paid to development of the machine gun. A general service\r\ncorps should be established. As things are now the average soldier has\r\nfar too much labor of a nonmilitary character to perform.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL GUARD.\r\n\r\nNow that the organized militia, the National Guard, has been\r\nincorporated with the Army as a part of the national forces, it\r\nbehooves the Government to do every reasonable thing in its power to\r\nperfect its efficiency. It should be assisted in its instruction and\r\notherwise aided more liberally than heretofore. The continuous services\r\nof many well-trained regular officers will be essential in this\r\nconnection. Such officers must be specially trained at service schools\r\nbest to qualify them as instructors of the National Guard. But the\r\ndetailing of officers for training at the service schools and for duty\r\nwith the National Guard entails detaching them from their regiments\r\nwhich are already greatly depleted by detachment of officers for\r\nassignment to duties prescribed by acts of the Congress.\r\n\r\nA bill is now pending before the Congress creating a number of extra\r\nofficers in the Army, which if passed, as it ought to be, will enable\r\nmore officers to be trained as instructors of the National Guard and\r\nassigned to that duty. In case of war it will be of the utmost\r\nimportance to have a large number of trained officers to use for\r\nturning raw levies into good troops.\r\n\r\nThere should be legislation to provide a complete plan for organizing\r\nthe great body of volunteers behind the Regular Army and National Guard\r\nwhen war has come. Congressional assistance should be given those who\r\nare endeavoring to promote rifle practice so that our men, in the\r\nservices or out of them, may know how to use the rifle. While teams\r\nrepresenting the United States won the rifle and revolver championships\r\nof the world against all comers in England this year, it is\r\nunfortunately true that the great body of our citizens shoot less and\r\nless as time goes on. To meet this we should encourage rifle practice\r\namong schoolboys, and indeed among all classes, as well as in the\r\nmilitary services, by every means in our power. Thus, and not\r\notherwise, may we be able to assist in preserving the peace of the\r\nworld. Fit to hold our own against the strong nations of the earth, our\r\nvoice for peace will carry to the ends of the earth. Unprepared, and\r\ntherefore unfit, we must sit dumb and helpless to defend ourselves,\r\nprotect others, or preserve peace. The first step--in the direction of\r\npreparation to avert war if possible, and to be fit for war if it\r\nshould come--is to teach our men to shoot.\r\n\r\nTHE NAVY.\r\n\r\nI approve the recommendations of the General Board for the increase of\r\nthe Navy, calling especial attention to the need of additional\r\ndestroyers and colliers, and above all, of the four battleships. It is\r\ndesirable to complete as soon as possible a squadron of eight\r\nbattleships of the best existing type. The North Dakota, Delaware,\r\nFlorida, and Utah will form the first division of this squadron. The\r\nfour vessels proposed will form the second division. It will be an\r\nimprovement on the first, the ships being of the heavy, single caliber,\r\nall big gun type. All the vessels should have the same tactical\r\nqualities--that is, speed and turning circle--and as near as possible\r\nthese tactical qualities should be the same as in the four vessels\r\nbefore named now being built.\r\n\r\nI most earnestly recommend that the General Board be by law turned into\r\na General Staff. There is literally no excuse whatever for continuing\r\nthe present bureau organization of the Navy. The Navy should be treated\r\nas a purely military organization, and everything should be\r\nsubordinated to the one object of securing military efficiency. Such\r\nmilitary efficiency can only be guaranteed in time of war if there is\r\nthe most thorough previous preparation in time of peace--a preparation,\r\nI may add, which will in all probability prevent any need of war. The\r\nSecretary must be supreme, and he should have as his official advisers\r\na body of line officers who should themselves have the power to pass\r\nupon and coordinate all the work and all the proposals of the several\r\nbureaus. A system of promotion by merit, either by selection or by\r\nexclusion, or by both processes, should be introduced. It is out of the\r\nquestion, if the present principle of promotion by mere seniority is\r\nkept, to expect to get the best results from the higher officers. Our\r\nmen come too old, and stay for too short a time, in the high command\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nTwo hospital ships should be provided. The actual experience of the\r\nhospital ship with the fleet in the Pacific has shown the invaluable\r\nwork which such a ship does, and has also proved that it is well to\r\nhave it kept under the command of a medical officer. As was to be\r\nexpected, all of the anticipations of trouble from such a command have\r\nproved completely baseless. It is as absurd to put a hospital ship\r\nunder a line officer as it would be to put a hospital on shore under\r\nsuch a command. This ought to have been realized before, and there is\r\nno excuse for failure to realize it now.\r\n\r\nNothing better for the Navy from every standpoint has ever occurred\r\nthan the cruise of the battle fleet around the world. The improvement\r\nof the ships in every way has been extraordinary, and they have gained\r\nfar more experience in battle tactics than they would have gained if\r\nthey had stayed in the Atlantic waters. The American people have cause\r\nfor profound gratification, both in view of the excellent condition of\r\nthe fleet as shown by this cruise, and in view of the improvement the\r\ncruise has worked in this already high condition. I do not believe that\r\nthere is any other service in the world in which the average of\r\ncharacter and efficiency in the enlisted men is as high as is now the\r\ncase in our own. I believe that the same statement can be made as to\r\nour officers, taken as a whole; but there must be a reservation made in\r\nregard to those in the highest ranks--as to which I have already\r\nspoken--and in regard to those who have just entered the service;\r\nbecause we do not now get full benefit from our excellent naval school\r\nat Annapolis. It is absurd not to graduate the midshipmen as ensigns;\r\nto keep them for two years in such an anomalous position as at present\r\nthe law requires is detrimental to them and to the service. In the\r\nacademy itself, every first classman should be required in turn to\r\nserve as petty officer and officer; his ability to discharge his duties\r\nas such should be a prerequisite to his going into the line, and his\r\nsuccess in commanding should largely determine his standing at\r\ngraduation. The Board of Visitors should be appointed in January, and\r\neach member should be required to give at least six days' service, only\r\nfrom one to three days' to be performed during June week, which is the\r\nleast desirable time for the board to be at Annapolis so far as\r\nbenefiting the Navy by their observations is concerned.\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\r\n\r\nTuesday, December 8, 1908.",
