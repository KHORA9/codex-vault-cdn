[Price 2 Cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Bennett, Barnum, and Gerard.\r\n\r\n_Three precocious villains stripped to the skin.—Precious, and\r\n  startling, and thrilling under-current revelations for the\r\n  people.—Read! Read! Read!_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bennett’s_ daily urgence of the immediate creation of a Tax Payer’s\r\nParty is one of his old tricks, and is the detected burglar’s hoarse cry\r\nof stop thief. Bennett got me to introduce Alfred Carson as a Candidate\r\nfor Mayor, just after his exciting Fire Report of 1850. I wrote several\r\narticles in favor of Carson for the Mayoralty, and Bennett published\r\nthem, when lo! one rainy morning, I awoke, and opened the _Herald_, and\r\nthe hypocritical old villain had another Candidate. I asked him if he\r\nintended to drop my old friend Carson, and he said no, but he thought he\r\nwould try to bring another candidate into the field, just for a little\r\nfun, and that I could write about three editorials a week for Carson,\r\nand flatter him as much as I chose, and he would publish them. This was\r\non Monday. On Wednesday, I caught him closeted with a formidable\r\ncandidate for the Mayoralty, and on Saturday, he very cautiously\r\nintroduced a third Candidate for the Mayor’s honors. As these were all\r\nwealthy men, and as Carson was very poor, and perceiving that Bennett\r\nunquestionably intended to sell Carson, and perhaps had already done so,\r\nI went to him in a towering rage, and charged him with treachery to\r\nmyself and Carson. He smiled like Richard and Iago, and assured me that\r\nhe should support Carson down to the last hour of the election. But I\r\ncould not believe him; so I went to Carson, on Sunday morning, and wrote\r\nhis famous declination of the Mayoralty, which rocked the parties of\r\nthat day to their foundations with infinite delight, as every traffic\r\npolitician had trembled to his toes, since the introduction of Carson’s\r\npotent and honest name for the Mayoralty. When I carried Carson’s Card\r\nto the _Herald_ office, on Sunday evening, Mr. Bennett was absent,\r\nhaving gone to the country with Judge Russell and his lady. But Frederic\r\nHudson was there—(his Aminadab Sleek Secretary,) who expostulated, and\r\nstrove by every artifice in his prolific resources, to induce me not to\r\npublish Carson’s Card until I had seen Mr. Bennett. But I demanded him\r\nto let the Card appear on the following morning, and told him that\r\nhimself and Bennett should be ashamed of themselves for striving to sell\r\nCarson through me, and that I believed Bennett had already received\r\nthousands of dollars for his contemplated sell of Carson, in favor of\r\none of the wealthy candidates. My withdrawal of Carson led to the\r\nelection of Ambrose C. Kingsland, a very illiterate man, and one of the\r\nmeanest of the human species, and the oiliest and biggest conspirator\r\nand public thief since the days of the Roman Cataline. In 1853, Bennett\r\nasked me to introduce the name of Alderman A. A. Denman, of the\r\nSixteenth Ward, as a candidate for Mayor, to whom I was imparting the\r\nrudiments of the English language, at his house in Nineteenth street.\r\nDenman was Chairman of the Committee that reported favorably at my\r\nrequest, on awarding the Corporation Printing to the _Herald_ at $3,000\r\nper annum, and the other journals at $1,000. Bennett seemed grateful to\r\nDenman for his favorable Printing Report, and I really thought he was\r\nsincere in his contemplated advocation of Denman for the Mayoralty; and\r\nI saw Denman, and he permitted me to use his name in connection with the\r\nMayoralty, and I began to write articles, and published them in the\r\n_Herald_, strongly recommending Denman to the Mayoralty. At this time,\r\nDenman was one of the most popular men in the democratic party, and his\r\nannunciation for Mayor, confused the leaders and aspirants of all\r\nparties. Presto! Bennett announces another candidate, in a sort of a\r\nhalf-and-half black mail way, and I instantly withdrew Denman, who was\r\nsadly disappointed at the loss of the Mayoralty honors, and joined the\r\nmost bloated thieves of all parties, in the odious Common Counsel of\r\n1852 and 1853, and he was soon forever lost as an honorable public man.\r\nAnd now this Scotch reprobate comes forward, without a blush on his\r\nvicious cheeks, and prates of a Tax Payer’s Party, in order to effect\r\nsome hellish thievish purpose. Perhaps his object is to nominate Judge\r\nRussell, or Fire Marshal Baker, or Galbraith, or some of his roguish\r\ngo-betweens and thimble-riggers for Mayor, so that he can occupy the\r\npleasant relations of Peter Cooper to Mayor Tiemann, his amiable\r\nson-in-law. But how the intelligent tax payers of the Metropolis can be\r\nso easily and so often bamboozled by this superficial Scotch Juggler, is\r\na mystery to me, when they all know that he has always favored vice, and\r\nstabbed virtue. And if there ever was a candidate for office, during\r\nBennett’s long editorial career, whom he did not sell, or if there ever\r\nwas a truly virtuous aspirant for public honors, whose election Bennett\r\never sincerely advocated before the people, without a cash\r\nconsideration, I should like to see the most extraordinary anomaly.\r\nBennett very ingeniously plasters his victims with disgusting panegyric,\r\nfor a brief period, when he lets loose the dogs of Tartarus, and while\r\nthey devour them, he fills his coffers with gold from every candidate in\r\nthe field, to whom he has pledged his support. But he is very old, and\r\nthe devil will soon have him, and millions will rejoice when old Nick\r\ndrags him to his fervent realms, and begins his merited tortures. And it\r\nwill require wasteless years to burn the sins from his infamous and\r\nloathsome and nauseous carcase. The creation of James Gordon Bennett’s\r\nTax Payer’s Party, after his cash advocation of all the abandoned scamps\r\nof America to office for thirty years, is the most amusing proposition\r\nof the age. And yet the omnipotent ballot stuffers may come to his\r\nrescue, and adopt his plans. And why should they not? Is not Barnum\r\nagain abroad, and about to shake the world with another humbug. Barnum\r\nhas grown prodigiously affluent since the Hard times began, and since\r\nmoney became scarce, and since people began to starve, and since the\r\nelements of Pluto leveled his Oriental Palace to the ground, (which was\r\nhighly insured!) and above all, since he took as partner, that cunning\r\nold rat, James W. Gerard, who, like Dick Connolly and Simeon Draper, is\r\never found in all political camps. Gerard was the real originator of the\r\nJoice Heath imposture, and all of Barnum’s humbugs, and has borne him\r\nthrough all his financial clock troubles, for which he has got enough\r\nfrom Barnum to enable him to sustain his chariots and postilions and\r\nmagnificent establishment in Gramercy Park until he dies. It was Gerard\r\nwho introduced Kingsland for Mayor, and other successful candidates,\r\nand, in the dark, advocated Fernando Wood’s course down to his\r\ndisastrous exodus from public life. And it was Gerard who sustained\r\nMatsell through all his infamous career, down to the famous meeting in\r\nthe Tabernacle, and in the Legislative lobby, even going into the seats\r\nof members, and coaxing them in various ways to spare Matsell. And it\r\nwas Gerard who, after Wood had fallen, went into the camp of Tiemann,\r\nwhere he is now, in order to cut the throats of Tiemann and the Coopers\r\nthe first opportunity, and is at this moment, in collusion with Bennett\r\nin the formation of a Tax Payer’s Party. “All things to all men” is the\r\nmotto of Gerard, and he has played his card adroitly for nearly half a\r\ncentury. But he has now probably got his last set of false teeth, and\r\nhis last wig, and will probably soon die of old age like his old friend\r\nBennett, who have operated together in ambuscade, for thirty unbroken\r\nyears, in all the political villainy that has been concocted during this\r\nlong and eventful period. No matter who succeeds in the elections,\r\nGerard and Bennett are in the triumphant camps, as now: Bennett in\r\nBuchanan’s White House, and Gerard in Mayor Tiemann’s confidence, and\r\nboth playing into each others hands, like Draper and Connolly.\r\nPicolomini is the last card that these jugglers will play. Gerard is a\r\nsnob and a dandy, and an Opera exquisite, and it was he, (through\r\nBarnum,) who introduced Jenny Lind to the Americans, and got Bennett,\r\nfor a large sum, to abuse Barnum and Jenny Lind, as an advertisement.\r\nBennett did not get less than $20,000 from _Gerard_ and Barnum for his\r\ndaily abuse of Jenny Lind and Barnum. I was daily in the _Herald_ office\r\nin those days, and I often saw Barnum closeted with Frederic Hudson, and\r\nJames Gordon Bennett. And Gerard and Barnum have already arranged with\r\nBennett, and paid him the cash down, to abuse Picolomini, while the\r\n_Times_ and _Tribune_ and many other journals are to be paid to praise\r\nher. And such a yell as we shall have on her arrival, will frighten the\r\nrats and cats. For, in this funny world, blarney is regarded as sincere\r\npraise and evidence of merit, while detraction is persecution, which\r\nverdant people won’t tolerate, and especially when hurled at such\r\nfascinating creatures as Fanny Elssler, or Jenny Lind, or Picolomini.\r\nThis is certainly a very curious world, and, like Dr. Franklin, I am\r\ncurious to know if our spiritual existence is to be as curious as our\r\nmaterial; and I am extremely anxious to learn if Bennett, Barnum, and\r\nGerard are to have an eternal abode in Heaven?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Stephen H. Branch’s Alligator.\r\n\r\n         ------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                   NEW YORK, SATURDAY, JULY 10, 1858.\r\n\r\n         ------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN H. BRANCH’S “ALLIGATOR” CAN BE obtained at all hours, (day or\r\nnight,) at wholesale and retail, at No. 128 Nassau Street, Near Beekman\r\nStreet, and opposite Ross & Tousey’s News Depot, New York.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The Fourth of July—General Washington in Tears—The Decline of American\r\n                       Integrity and Patriotism.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a formidable mutiny in the Army of the Revolution, arising\r\nfrom the inability of the Government to pay the officers and soldiers,\r\nwho assure Washington that, in order to provide food and raiment for\r\ntheir wives and children, they should return to their homes, and\r\ncultivate their neglected fields, and pursue their various peaceful\r\navocations, if their salaries were not paid on a stated day. Washington\r\ninvites the prominent leaders to meet him, and they accept his cordial\r\ninvitation. The Hall is filled at an early hour with the bravest\r\nofficers of the American camp, whom the village bell summons to hear an\r\nAddress from their great Commander, and as its doleful reverberations\r\nexpire on the evening air, Washington enters with unwonted dignity and\r\ngloom, and ascends the rostrum, and seats himself, and unfolds his\r\nAddress to his noble and impoverished comrades. He sits, with one hand\r\non his heart, and the other over his temples and unearthly eyes, and is\r\napparently absorbed in grief and prayer. The silence of the tomb\r\npervades the martial audience, and all seem to regard the hour as the\r\nmost momentous in human history, as the return of the officers and\r\nsoldiers to their homes, at this solemn crisis of the Revolution, might\r\nprove to be the funeral of liberty, and of patriots throughout the\r\nWorld. Washington approaches the desk, and stands like a statue, when\r\nneither whisper nor respiration can be heard, throughout the mournful\r\nthrong. With haggard cheeks, and without repose for three successive\r\nnights, he wipes the copious tears from his blood-shot eyes, and\r\nmoistens his parched mouth with water, and strives hard to articulate,\r\nbut his big heart is so full, and his lips quiver so rapidly, and his\r\ntears fall so fast, that his speech is paralysed, and his vision\r\nblinded. The officers regret their rashness, and breathe heavy sighs,\r\nand recline their heads in silent grief, and some weep aloud, which\r\nkindles their feelings into a general lamentation, and the patriotic\r\nladies thrill the entire assemblage with their piercing ejaculations.\r\nWashington strives to summon his wonderful self-possession, (which never\r\ndeserted him till now,) and he rallies his resources like the dead of\r\nthe resurrection, when he breathes these figurative truths, in the voice\r\nof a celestial being: “My beloved Companions: You know that I have grown\r\ngray in your service, and now you perceive that I am growing blind.” And\r\nwhile he utters these touching words, his iron nerve again succumbs, and\r\nhe moistens his manuscript with the waters of his supernatural heart. He\r\nseats himself, and buries his face, and weeps as in his spotless\r\nchildhood. The valiant officers, (who had never faltered amid the\r\ncarnage and thunders of battle,) are utterly overwhelmed by Washington’s\r\ntears, and they depart for their respective quarters, and relate what\r\nhas transpired, which infuses new fortitude and patriotism and\r\nunconquerable valor in the breasts of the desponding and mutinous\r\nsoldiers, who rush to arms with the wild and irresistible impetuosity of\r\nGreene and Putnam, and the liberties of America are soon achieved. What\r\na withering rebuke is this to the public thieves and traitors of the\r\npresent generation. The only hope of our country is in the early\r\nappearance of a race of men like Washington, Jefferson, Franklin,\r\nMadison, Adams, Hamilton, Jackson, Calhoun, Clay, and Webster. With such\r\ncorrupt and brainless wretches at the head of the American Press as\r\nBennett, Greeley, and Raymond, with their gangs of mercenary scribblers\r\nin collusion with official robbers in the Municipal, State, and National\r\nCapitols, may the Good Being who heard the prayers of Washington (amid\r\nthe snow, and blood, and hunger, and nakedness of the Revolution) have\r\nmercy on the great body of our people, who are threatened with general\r\npillage and despotism by the vampires whom editors—in collusion with\r\nbands of thieves and assassins—fraudulently elect to the highest posts\r\nof emolument and honor. The official robbers of a nation’s treasury are\r\nthe uncompromising foes of the toiling millions, and of human freedom. O\r\nthen let the virtuous and industrious classes rally, and drive back the\r\npernicious burglars of their firesides. And on the coming National\r\nSabbath, let the pure and patriotic youth and meritorious age go up to\r\nthe Altars of our Fathers and our common God, and swear a ceaseless\r\ncrusade against the plunderers of our country, and the dastard monsters\r\nwho would distract, and divide, and alienate the affections of our\r\ncountrymen, on whose fidelity to Washington and the Union impend the\r\nhopes and happiness and liberty of the human race for eternal years.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n_Let the Supervisors_ watch the operations of Richard B. Connolly, who\r\nhas prowled around the Aldermen and Councilmen and Supervisors for\r\nseveral years, from whom he has had not a farthing less than $1,000,000\r\nsince he has been County Clerk. The Supervisors alone voted him $316,000\r\nfor the printing of his musty and worthless Records, which no paper\r\nmanufacturer would have purchased, nor even carted to their factories as\r\na donation. And they are of less value to the public in their printed\r\nform, than to the paper makers. It is a study, and a sad one for the tax\r\npayers, to see Dick Connolly and George H. Purser sitting in the Boards\r\nof Aldermen and Councilmen and Supervisors at almost every session, for\r\nmany years past, watching and nudging and coaxing the members to vote\r\nfor their plundering enactments. These two scamps have never been\r\nnaturalised, and have perjured themselves, since they cast their first\r\nballots. But they don’t perjure themselves any more in that way, as they\r\ndon’t dare vote, and have not voted since I exposed their alienage,\r\nthree years since. They have packed more Grand and Petit Juries, and\r\ncondemned and imprisoned and hung more innocent men, and robbed the City\r\nand Albany Treasuries to a greater extent than any other two public\r\nthieves and precocious monsters who walk the streets of New York. And\r\nboth of these precious rascals now announce themselves as candidates for\r\nComptroller! And they intend to buy their nomination and election with\r\nthe very money they have stolen and are stealing daily from the people.\r\nO that there was a Brutus or Cincinnatus to rebuke these villains, and\r\nto stab them down, and to thus shame and scourge the people for\r\npermitting such villains to go unpunished.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n_I will soon show_ some of the mysterious currents of the Metropolis,\r\nand establish the friendly relations of Horace Greeley and Dana with\r\nDick Connolly and Simeon Draper, in reference to the Alms House Spoils,\r\nand other extensive pickings and stealings. It is amusing to me to often\r\nsee _Greeley’s Tribune_ whitewash the rakish and thievish Ten Governors.\r\nI will also show how Connolly and Draper hold their influence with the\r\n_Courier and Enquirer_, _Evening Post_, and _Commercial Advertiser_. And\r\nhow Dick and Sim silence the mercenary growls of the _Herald_. Fred\r\nHudson and Galbraith and Bennett and Fire Marshal Baker could disclose\r\nthese little matters, but as they could not do it without implicating\r\nthemselves in stupendous villainy, I shall have to show how the black\r\nmail growls of the _Herald_ are quickly silenced. The Institution of\r\nDeath is a clincher to these devils. O, if such scoundrels as Connolly\r\nand Draper and Hudson and Bennett could only live always, they would\r\nhave a nice time, but when they see a funeral, or have a deadly gripe in\r\nthe direction of their wicked livers, they shudder with horror, and pray\r\nharder and louder than a stout noisy Methodist darkey minister, until\r\nthe gripe has passed away, and they have a fresh hold on dear life\r\nagain, when their nerve returns, and they steal more, and oppress the\r\ntax payers and poor consumers with less remorse than before they had\r\nalmost a fatal gripe. But the worms and the devil will soon grab their\r\nthievish flesh and bones, and then, O Moses! what a precious feast they\r\nwill have.\r\n\r\n                       O the grave! the grave!\r\n                       Mourns for the poor slave;\r\n                       But for public thieves,\r\n                       The grave never grieves.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lives of PETER COOPER and JAMES GORDON BENNETT are omitted this\r\nweek. My Journal is so small, and my advertisements increase so rapidly,\r\nthat I shall not be able to continue the lives of these distinguished\r\nmen in every issue. But in my next number, the Lives of Cooper and\r\nBennett will appear. These men have silenced those who have threatened\r\nto publish their wicked antecedents, but they will never silence me,\r\nonly through imprisonment, or poison, or assassination, which I have\r\nreason to believe they contemplate. All the wholesale dealers stopped\r\nselling the ALLIGATOR three weeks since, lest Bennett would not let them\r\nhave the _Heralds_ for their country agents. I strove to fasten the fact\r\nupon him, that he directed the wholesale dealers to stop selling the\r\nALLIGATOR, and if I had nailed upon his forehead his Napoleonic edicts\r\nto suppress the liberty and circulation of the American Press, I would\r\nhave deliberately gone into his office, and shot him dead. No foreign\r\nunnaturalised scab like Bennett, shall trample with impunity the\r\nprecious rights, and the glorious liberty that George Washington and my\r\nGrandfather bequeathed to me. So, Mr. Bennett, and Fred. Hudson, just\r\nhave a care, and I implore you in your persecution, to keep your keen\r\neyes strongly riveted on the last feather that broke the poor camel’s\r\nback.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n_It is very strange_ what has become of the stereotype plates containing\r\nJames Gordon Bennett’s curious relations with Fanny Elssler, during her\r\nfamous sojourn in America. Can you inform me, Ross & Tousey, where they\r\nare? If you will tell me, I will not tell Bennett that you told me,\r\nwhich will not give him a pretext to stop your supply of _Heralds_\r\nagain, by which you told me you lost several thousand dollars. Besides,\r\nif he does, you can get rich fast enough by selling the _Ledger_ and\r\nALLIGATOR. So tell us where these mysterious plates can be found.\r\nPerhaps they are on storage in Philadelphia. “Who knows?” as the amiable\r\nDr. Wallace very often says at the close of his abrupt and hurried\r\n_Herald_ editorials, when he is thirsty or hungry, or wants to go to the\r\nTheatre or Opera.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Erben_, the Trinity Church Organ Grinder, will please inform me if\r\nhe owns a house in Baxter street, and if the character of the inmates\r\nare as respectable as himself, and especially the females. James Gordon\r\nBennett will also please go into Baxter street, and ascertain and inform\r\nme if Mr. Erben’s house is as reputable as Helen Jewett’s old residence,\r\nat No. 41 Thomas street. Speak out, Satans Numbers One and Two.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nI had to omit the continuation of my LIFE this week, which will appear\r\nin the next number of the “ALLIGATOR.”\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   Mayor Daniel F. Tiemann’s Forced Seduction of a Lady on Randall’s\r\nIsland—Simeon Draper’s Lascivious Propensities—Most Damning Revelations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years since, there was a lovely domestic circle in our city,\r\nconsisting of a husband, wife, and three children. The father died, and\r\nthe widow was cast upon the world, without means to feed and clothe and\r\neducate her precious offspring. She had been the favorite daughter of\r\naffluent parents, and was educated by the ablest teachers. In\r\nconversation, she was eloquent and impassioned, and her fluent and\r\nmelodious words, as they flowed from her red and pouting lips, and her\r\neven and pearly teeth, fascinated all who had the envied fortune to\r\nlinger on her luxuriant language, and pretty smiles, and dimples, and\r\nmost extraordinary purity of expression. Governor Simeon Draper fastens\r\nhis voluptuous eyes upon her, and her fate is sealed. Three years since,\r\nGov. Draper proposes that she become a matron on Randall’s Island, and\r\nshe accepts his proposition, and he procures her a situation. After she\r\nbegan to discharge her matron duties, Governors Draper and Bell (now\r\nSupervisor), entered her domestic apartment on Randall’s Island, and\r\nasked her what she had in the next room, pointing their fingers to her\r\nbed room. She said they might look for themselves. They replied: “What\r\nare you afraid of?” She said: “I am not afraid, but I do not desire to\r\ngo into a bedroom with two gentlemen.” They then seized her, and strove\r\nto drag her into her bed room, when she resisted and finally screamed,\r\nwhich alarmed them, and they withdrew their hands, and said: “You need\r\nnot be afraid to go with us into the bed room, singly, as we know that\r\nyou have let a _friend_ go with you into your bed room ever since your\r\nhusband died, and enjoy your fascinations to his heart’s content.” She\r\nsaid: “If my _friend_ has done the thing of which you speak, neither of\r\nyou shall.” Governors Draper and Bell then retired, but Draper soon\r\nreturned, and proposed to buy two cloaks for two handsome girls who were\r\nabout to leave the Institution, and said that she should go to the city\r\nand buy them, and at the same time purchase one for herself, regardless\r\nof price, and send the bill to his office, and he would pay it. She\r\nobjected on the ground that if she accepted the proposition, he would\r\nexpect licentious favors in return. Draper said that he was so anxious\r\nto stay with her, that he wouldn’t mind giving her $50 in cash. She said\r\nthat she feared her _friend_ would hear of it, and withdraw his\r\naffections, and might kill him, and perhaps her, as he truly loved her,\r\nand was of a very jealous and impulsive nature. Draper said she needn’t\r\nbe afraid, as he could never hear of it. She then accepted his\r\nproposition to go to the city and purchase the cloaks, and directed the\r\nbill to be sent to his office, which was done, and he paid it. At this\r\ntime, a fervent friendship was budding into bloom and blossom, between\r\nherself and Governor Daniel F. Tiemann, to whom she immediately\r\ndisclosed all that had transpired between herself and Governors Bell and\r\nDraper. Tiemann affected great exasperation, and wrote her statement,\r\n(which terribly excoriated Draper,) with the design of presenting it to\r\nthe Ten Governors in open session. This alarmed her, and she told her\r\n_friend_ what had occurred, and that Governor Tiemann was about to\r\nexpose Governors Bell and Draper to the Board of Ten Governors, and to\r\nthe whole world, to which he strongly objected, as it might involve them\r\nin a common ruin, and he urged her to request Governor Tiemann not to\r\npresent the document. And he assured her, if she permitted Governor\r\nTiemann to do this favor for her, that he might soon want her smiles and\r\nbeauty and caresses and embraces, (like Bell and Draper), as a requital\r\nfor his apparently disinterested and meritorious services in her behalf.\r\nShe saw Tiemann, and the document was suppressed. Draper heard of her\r\nmovements, and became jealous of her partiality for Tiemann, and he had\r\nher suspended. But Tiemann had her reinstated. When Bell and Draper’s\r\ntime expired as Alms House Governors, Gov. Tiemann immediately resolved\r\nthat her _friend_ should not visit the Island, as the first movement to\r\nhis contemplated seduction of the beautiful matron. And he was so\r\ndetermined, that he resorted to the daring effort to exclude him, even\r\nafter he obtained a permit. For Gov. Tiemann clearly saw that while her\r\n_friend_ visited her, he (Tiemann) would have a poor chance to gratify\r\nhis own lust. Tiemann finally succeeded in ejecting her _friend_ from\r\nthe Island, and on a dark and rainy afternoon, slyly meandered into her\r\napartment, and after some loving smiles, and dulcet words, and melting\r\nsighs, and tender glances, he drew his chair towards her, and began to\r\nfeel of her. She long resisted his extraordinary amorous movements, and\r\nstruck him twice, and scratched and bit him, and terribly exhausted him\r\nand herself in their mutual struggles, and thought she had conquered\r\nhim. But in his last desperate rally, he overpowered and vanquished her,\r\nand she had to let him go his whole length, and he accomplished his most\r\nhellish purpose. Her boy was living in the West, and wrote to her, that\r\nhe was not only displeased with his relatives, but with the western\r\ncountry, and desired to return to New York. She showed the letter to\r\nGov. Tiemann, and told him that she had not the money to spare to defray\r\nhis expenses home. He asked her how much it would cost. She said $15,\r\nwhen he gave her $40, assuring her that he would not have it known for\r\nthe world, that he let her have money to pay her son’s expenses home.\r\nShe quieted his fears, by assuring him that she would never disclose it.\r\nShe sent the money to her boy, and he came home. Gov. Tiemann then got\r\nhim a situation, but the boy had seen Tiemann take improper liberties\r\nwith his mother, and as he strongly suspected he had allured her from\r\nthe paths of virtue, he very indignantly refused to accept the situation\r\ntendered by Gov. Tiemann. But in eight months afterwards, Gov. Tiemann\r\nobtained another place for the boy, and after unceasing importunity, he\r\nfinally persuaded the boy to accept a situation in Broadway, where he\r\nnow is. Last Autumn she had an interview with her _friend_ in this city,\r\nwhen he charged her with sexual intercourse with Governor Tiemann. She\r\nburst into a tremendous flood of tears, and cast herself into his arms,\r\nand craved his forgiveness in rending accents. He asked her why she had\r\nlong permitted Governor Tiemann to use her beautiful person. She said\r\nthat as he was poor, and Governor Tiemann rich, and had foiled Draper in\r\nher suspension, and had elegantly furnished her apartments on the\r\nIsland, and had paid the expenses of her boy from the West to the city,\r\nand had got him a good situation in Broadway, and had made her\r\nmagnificent donations in jewelry and apparel, and had let her have money\r\nwhen she asked him,—and fearing that if she refused to gratify his lust,\r\nhe would instantly have her dismissed as Matron, to endure again the\r\ntortures of penury,—that in view of all this, she had let him have\r\nsexual intercourse with her whenever he desired. But that she despised\r\nhim for his wickedness, as he was a Church Member, in good standing, and\r\nas he professed to be one of the leading Reformers of the age. Her\r\n_friend_ asked her how much money he had given her, and she said: “Quite\r\na large sum, some of which I have deposited in a Bank,” and she told him\r\nthe name of the Bank. She also told him where the chairs, sofas,\r\nmirrors, stoves, &c., were purchased, and showed him the receipted\r\nbills, which she placed in his hands, and he has them now. She then\r\nbesought his pardon, and assured him that she would leave the Island,\r\nand come and live and die in his affectionate embraces. He forgave her,\r\nand she returned to the Island, and told Governor Tiemann that she\r\ndesired to leave and return to her _friend’s_ humble abode, which\r\nalarmed Tiemann, who implored her in tears to remain, and he would\r\nprotect her as long as he lived, and when on the eve of death, he would\r\nmake ample provision for her support during her life. They were together\r\nin her apartment, for ten successive hours, in a most exciting and\r\nharrowing scene, when he promised to give her $500 on the following day,\r\nand she finally yielded, and remained, and is at the Island now, both as\r\na Matron and as Mayor Tiemann’s Mistress. Her _friend_ was so\r\nexasperated with her double treachery, that he went to one of the Ten\r\nGovernors, (who is now in the Board,) and disclosed in writing under his\r\nsignature the entire villainy of Tiemann. The Governor in question sent\r\nfor Tiemann, and asked him if the statement was true, when he colored\r\ninto a ball of fire, and left in shame and silence. The Governor did not\r\nexpose Tiemann, in consequence of his innocent and interesting family,\r\nand his aged father, and his numerous relatives, including the versatile\r\nPeter Cooper, whose adopted daughter Mayor Tiemann married. These\r\nrevelations will cause the worthy citizens of New York to bend their\r\nheads in sorrow, to behold a man of Mayor Tiemann’s exalted professions\r\nof purity and piety, guilty of crimes that should consign him to the\r\nrack, and to an eternal hell.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Advertisements—25 Cents a line.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit—From two to four seconds, or as long as the Advertiser can hold\r\nhis breath!
