C.\r\n  Published by the Academy,\r\n  1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Disfranchisement of the Negro.\r\n\r\n     \"A Constitution formed so as to enable a party to overrule its very\r\n     government, and to overpower the people too, answers the purpose\r\n     neither of government nor of freedom\"--Edmund Burke.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe assault, under the forms of law, which is being made upon the\r\npolitical rights of the Negro is the symptom of an animus which has its\r\nroots imbedded in the past. It does not mark a revival, but rather the\r\nsupreme desperate effort of the spirit of tyranny to compass the\r\npolitical subjection and consequent social degradation of the black man.\r\nIts provocation does not consist in any abnormal or perilous condition\r\nin southern communities arising from a numerical preponderance of\r\nNegroes. It is not made to meet a merely temporary emergency with the\r\nintent to return to the principles of republican government upon the\r\nadvent of intelligence and wealth to the Negro. Indeed, the very intent\r\nand purpose of the assault is to prevent such an advent, in so far as\r\nhuman ingenuity and tyrannical violence can do so.\r\n\r\nIt can not find its justification in a necessity of averting by radical\r\nmeasures any imagined perils to social order which might arise from the\r\npolitical domination of ignorance; for the spirit which prompts the\r\nassault has ever fostered ignorance and endeavored to perpetuate it. In\r\nfact, the assault is so iniquitous in its conception and is being\r\nexecuted with such wicked and violent disregard of political morals and\r\nhuman rights, as by comparison to render almost beneficent the\r\nrealization of the perils which the imagination of the assailants\r\npretends to fancy.\r\n\r\nThere may be those who see in this assault nothing more than a supreme\r\neffort of a benign civilization to save itself from utter ruin. It is,\r\nhowever, to be borne in mind that the apostles of this civilization\r\nwhich is of a peculiarly local type, have ever asserted that its\r\nmaintenance and future glory are inseparably connected with the\r\nsubjection of the Negro. Always they have spoken the language of\r\ntyranny, which, in spite of its embellishments and jugglings, amounts to\r\nthis: the social well-being and political privileges of the Negro are\r\ninconsistent with the economic interests and political ambitions of a\r\nfew southern white men. Into this language all of the feigned social\r\nperils and political nightmares of southern planters and politicians\r\neasily resolve themselves.\r\n\r\nThere may be those who indulge the hope that the final triumph of this\r\nassault will have a salutary effect upon the social status of the Negro.\r\nTheir hope is due in no small measure to their ignorance of the history\r\nof the character, spirit, and dominant purpose of the assailants. That\r\nhistory furnishes the best key to an understanding of the present\r\nassault upon the political rights of the Negro.\r\n\r\nForty years ago the slave power plunged this nation into war for the\r\navowed purpose of perpetuating Negro slavery. Alexander Stevens, on his\r\nreturn from the convention which had erected the Southern Confederacy,\r\naddressing a large assembly at Savannah, uttered the following\r\nsignificant words:\r\n\r\n     \"The new Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating\r\n     questions relating to our peculiar institution--African slavery as\r\n     it exists among us--_the proper_ status of the Negro in our form of\r\n     civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and\r\n     the present revolution.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to the ideas of Thomas Jefferson and the leading statesmen at\r\nthe time of the formation of the Federal Constitution, that Negro\r\nSlavery was in violation of the laws of Nature, wrong in \"principle,\r\nsocially, morally and politically,\" he continued thus:\r\n\r\n\"Those ideas were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption\r\nof the equality of races. Our constitution (the Confederate\r\nConstitution,) is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas. Its\r\nfoundations are laid, its corner stone rests upon the great truth that\r\nthe Negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to\r\nthe superior race, is his natural and normal condition.\"[1]\r\n\r\nIt has become the rule to frown upon any and all references to the\r\ncircumstances and causes that produced the Civil War. This is true\r\nespecially of the men and women who upheld the cause of the Union as\r\nagainst Secession. Naturally magnanimous, they have been at great pains\r\nto avoid in their public utterances any references to the \"late\r\nunpleasantness\" which might in any way wound the sensibilities of the\r\nexcessively sensitive South. Certainly, nothing can be more sincerely\r\ndesired than the utter eradication of the passions and animosities that\r\nwere evoked by armed conflict. But to ignore the fundamental cause and\r\nmotive which led the South to precipitate the war, with a view to\r\nseeming not to be influenced by sectional prejudices is pushing\r\nmagnanimity to the verge of vapid sentimentality--a folly in which the\r\nSouth, in so far as its attitude toward the Negro is concerned, has in\r\nno sense shared.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of \"the proper status of the Negro,\" is as consistently\r\nmaintained by the South in eighteen hundred and ninety-nine as in\r\neighteen hundred and sixty, when it was made the shibboleth of the\r\nSlavery Party and the tocsin of war; and there can be no proper\r\nconsideration of our present Negro Problem without regard to this\r\nhistorical doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe Southern Confederacy is now a political myth. In its attempt to make\r\nNegro Slavery its corner stone, it carved the gravestones of more than a\r\nmillion men. Upon the proclamation of peace and universal freedom, the\r\nnation's joy was without bounds. In the intense enthusiasm of the moment\r\nover the \"new birth of freedom,\" and the overthrow of the slave power,\r\nthe doctrine of the \"proper status of the Negro\" seemed to be eternally\r\nrepudiated and the agitations relating to it seemed indeed \"forever\r\nsettled.\" But in the throes of its joy, there suddenly dawned upon the\r\nnation the fact that the problems pertaining to the Negro had, because\r\nof freedom, become more stupendous than even the question of slavery had\r\nbeen. Henceforth the Negro Problem was to test severely the integrity of\r\nrepublican principles.\r\n\r\nThis was the critical period of the history of the Negro in America.\r\nWithin almost the twinkling of an eye, by an exigency of one of the\r\nworld's greatest wars, his status had been suddenly changed. The slave\r\nbecame a free man by the dispensation of Providence and against the will\r\nof his master.\r\n\r\nA free man, yet penniless and homeless. A man of toil, but one whose own\r\nand whose ancestral toil had created a material and social grandeur\r\nwhich now mocked at his poverty and arrogantly denied him a share in its\r\nblessings. A free man, but ignorant, the greatest curse imposed by his\r\nformer status which had contributed to the enlightenment of others. A\r\nfreeman, but helpless in the face of an impending persecution. He, whose\r\nlabor had contributed to the comfort and social happiness of\r\nothers,--who, while they were testing on scores of battle fields their\r\npower to rob him of his freedom, was caring for and protecting their\r\nwives and daughters and furnishing the sinews of the unholy war--was now\r\nat the mercy of those who had gone forth to battle with the cry that,\r\n\"slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal\r\ncondition.\"\r\n\r\nThe Thirteenth Amendment became the law of the land through the travail\r\nof war. But the war had sapped the Nation's strength, had cost nearly a\r\nmillion lives and created a debt of three billions. Weary of strife and\r\nvexation, the nation was fain to leave the settlement of the problems,\r\nto which the new status of the Negro had given rise, to those among whom\r\nhe was to live, i.e., to his former masters.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed a critical period in the history of the Negro race in\r\nthe United States and the lessons of this period are exceedingly\r\nimportant in the light of the present attack upon the political rights\r\nof the black man.\r\n\r\nIn recent discussions of the merits and wisdom of Negro suffrage, this\r\nperiod is as a rule strangely overlooked. The assertion so commonly\r\nmade, that the conferring of the right to vote upon the Negro was a\r\ncolossal blunder, evinces the extent to which this period has been\r\nignored by those who make it, or else their remarkable ignorance of the\r\nhistory of Negro suffrage. Political prejudices and the blind zeal and\r\nopportunism of those who have discovered some \"sure cure,\" for the\r\nNegro's ills have aided much in the work of discrediting Negro suffrage.\r\nSome have ignored the facts to such an extent as to assert that Negro\r\nsuffrage was the result of vindictiveness on the part of the\r\nNortherners, who wished both to humiliate the South and to perpetuate\r\nthe power of the Republican Party. The trouble with this assertion is\r\nthat it imputes too much to Northern sagacity. What the nation, through\r\nthe agency of the Republican party, did was to enact the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment and thus to make President Lincoln's conditional proclamation\r\nof freedom an unconditioned part of the organic law. The extent of its\r\nrevenge was to insist upon the incorporation of this principle of\r\nfreedom into the old Slave Constitutions of the South. This was the\r\nterms of surrender and having accepted this, the South was left alone\r\n(the boon it has always craved) with full power to deal with the Negro\r\nas tenderly as it saw fit. The Negro was left a \"sojourner on\r\nsufferance\" in the great republic which he had assisted in saving, and\r\nto the sweet charity of those who had sought to destroy it for the\r\npurpose of binding him with unbreakable chains.\r\n\r\nBy the acceptance of the terms imposed, the rebellious states placed\r\nthemselves in a position of great responsibility and great opportunity.\r\nThe responsibility of the old South, the South of slavery and rebellion,\r\nwas to properly adjust itself to the new conditions of freedom and\r\ninseparable union, its opportunity was to prove to the nation the claim\r\nit so often and so boastfully makes that it is the Negro's best friend\r\nand is disposed to treat him fairly.\r\n\r\nDid the South rise to its opportunity? Did it treat liberally and kindly\r\nthose freedmen who as slaves had created its material wealth and many of\r\nwhom as soldiers had with the irony of fate helped to keep it from\r\nseparating from the Union of which it is now proud of being an integral\r\npart? Did it hold out to them the promise of gradual citizenship, and,\r\nin order that this citizenship should be intelligent, establish schools\r\nfor their education? Was it jealous or in any way solicitous about the\r\neconomic and industrial freedom of these people? In its bearing upon the\r\npresent disfranchising enactments of the South, the answer to these\r\nquestions is important.\r\n\r\nUnaccustomed to free schools, trained to despise and punish the\r\nintellectual aspirations of the slave, these recently rebellious states\r\nnot only refused to educate the freedmen, but actually burned many\r\nschools that were built by men and women of the North, who in obedience\r\nto genuine Christian charity followed in the wake of the armies of\r\nfreedom. Then as now, it proceeded to fix the Negro's status by hostile\r\nlegislation in the shape of Black codes. These laws reveal the\r\ndeliberate purpose of the South to reduce the freedmen to a state of\r\nserfdom more bitter and degrading than slavery had been, and violated\r\nthe most sacred of the inherent rights of human nature.\r\n\r\nThe civilized state of Alabama, which is now preparing to disfranchise\r\nthe Negro, declared that \"stubborn and refractory servants, and servants\r\nwho loiter away their time,\" were to be treated as vagrants, fined fifty\r\ndollars and \"in default of payment might be hired out at public auction\r\nfor a period of six months.\"[2] Thus the Thirteenth Amendment did not\r\ndestroy the auction block.\r\n\r\nFlorida declared that \"it shall not be lawful for any Negro or person of\r\ncolor to own, use, or keep any bowie knife, dirk, sword or fire arms or\r\nammunition of any kind\" without license, to be granted only upon the\r\nrecommendation of two \"respectable\" white men. For violating this law\r\nthe Negro was to stand in the pillory for one hour and then be whipped\r\nwith thirty-nine lashes on the bare back.[3] South Carolina, always bold\r\nto reveal its purpose, declared that \"no person of color shall pursue\r\nthe practice, art, trade or business of an artisan, mechanic, shopkeeper\r\nor any other employment besides that of husbandry or that of a servant\r\nunder contract for labor\"[4] without a license, which was good for one\r\nyear only; and she supplemented this with the following:\r\n\r\n     \"That a person of color, who is in the employment of a master\r\n     engaged in husbandry, shall not have the license to sell any corn,\r\n     rice, peas, wheat or other grain, any flour, cotton, fodder, hay,\r\n     bacon, fresh meat of any kind or any other product of a farm,\r\n     without written permission of such master.\"[5]\r\n\r\nLouisiana, which has recently outlawed the Negro by Constitutional\r\nenactment, declared:\r\n\r\n     \"Every adult freedman or woman shall furnish themselves with a\r\n     comfortable home and visible means of support _within twenty days_\r\n     after the passage of this act!\"[6]\r\n\r\nFailing to do so, such persons were to be hired out at public auction\r\nfor the rest of the year.\r\n\r\nLet it be borne in mind that these laws were not enactments of a distant\r\nand forgotten past. They were the deliberate enactments of that period\r\nfor the purpose of nullifying the Thirteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\nOf this period Mr. Justice Miller in rendering the decision in the\r\nSlaughter House Cases said:\r\n\r\n     \"The process of restoring to their proper relations with the\r\n     Federal Government and with the other states those which had sided\r\n     with the rebellion, undertaken under the proclamation of President\r\n     Johnson in 1865, and before the assembling of Congress, developed\r\n     the fact that, notwithstanding the formal recognition by those\r\n     states of the abolition of slavery, the condition of the slave race\r\n     would, without further protection of the Federal Government, be\r\n     almost as bad as it was before. Among the first acts of legislation\r\n     adopted by several of the states in the legislative bodies which\r\n     claimed to be in their normal relations with the Federal\r\n     Government, were laws which imposed upon the colored race onerous\r\n     disabilities and burdens, and curtailed their rights in the pursuit\r\n     of life, liberty, and property to such an extent that their freedom\r\n     was of little value, while they had lost their protection which\r\n     they had received from their former owners from motives both of\r\n     interest and humanity.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThis is what happened to the Negro when the South was left alone to deal\r\nwith him and when he was voteless.\r\n\r\nJames G. Blaine truly said that:\r\n\r\n     \"Without the right of citizenship his freedom could be maintained\r\n     only in name, and without the elective franchise his citizenship\r\n     would have no legitimate and no authoritative protection.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately for the Negro and for the continuance of free institutions\r\nin the South, the nation slowly perceived this truth, but not until a\r\nlong and bitter struggle had been carried on by the friends of freedom\r\nfor manhood suffrage and human rights. These infamous, repressive and\r\nenslaving laws finally aroused the nation's sense of justice and brought\r\nit to the realization of the undeniable truth that in a free government\r\n\"the strong keen sword by which a freeman can protect all other rights\r\nand give value to all other privileges is the elective franchise.\"\r\n\r\nYet in the full consciousness of this truth, attested beyond cavil by\r\nthe inhuman subjection of the Negro to the arrogant and oppressive will\r\nof those who held peculiar notions about his \"proper status,\" the\r\nFederal Government hesitated to go the full length of its duty. It\r\nstopped midway. The war seemed not to have convinced it of the futility\r\nand fatality of compromising with the South. The Fourteenth Amendment\r\nwas adopted. The Negro was thereby given the right which his Southern\r\nguardians proudly refused him--the right of citizenship--but not the\r\nright which is alone the guarantee of the privileges of citizenship--the\r\nright to a voice in the government of which he was declared a citizen.\r\nThe power of conferring suffrage limited or universal, was left as the\r\nspecial privilege of the South. But the South proceeded to nullify the\r\nFourteenth Amendment as it had nullified the Thirteenth and sent her\r\ncaptains of rebellion to make the nation's laws.\r\n\r\nImpelled by the motive of self preservation, by the sheer necessity of\r\nsaving itself from those who would have destroyed it, and of saving to\r\nthe freedmen the simple inherent right of self-ownership, the nation was\r\nforced to confer upon the Negro the right to vote by the adoption of the\r\nFifteenth Amendment. This step it is now popular to characterize as a\r\nblunder or as an act of revenge designed to humiliate the South. If it\r\nwas, then the preservation of the Union and the abolition of slavery are\r\nnameless crimes.\r\n\r\nThe period of Reconstruction has served as the text for discrediting\r\nNegro Suffrage and is always the apt illustration that gives point to\r\nthe argument of those who attempt to prove the incapacity of the Negro\r\nto exercise the right of suffrage. There is no doubt that the effort to\r\nmould public sentiment away from Negro Suffrage has been generally\r\nsuccessful and this success has been achieved very largely through\r\nmisrepresentation in regard to the facts of Reconstruction. The great\r\nbody of active citizens have grown into full citizenship since the\r\nReconstruction epoch, are consequently ignorant of its true history and\r\nquite satisfied to receive the information concerning it from those\r\nwhose interest and delight it is to resort to misrepresentation.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to enter into a defense of Reconstruction, but\r\nmerely to call attention to the following facts:\r\n\r\n(1) The attempt to reconstruct the rebellious states along lines of\r\nRepublican principles failed until the Negro was given the right to\r\nvote. Those who had participated in the War of the Rebellion and to whom\r\nthe opportunity had been given to return to normal relations with the\r\nFederal Government without the interference of the Negro, failed signally\r\nand deliberately to do so in an acceptable manner. Negro Suffrage was\r\ntherefore an essential and beneficent factor in the work of\r\nreconstruction.[8]\r\n\r\n(2) The accepted history of that period has been written by those who\r\nrode into power by murder and intimidation and to whose interest it is\r\nto paint the history of reconstruction so dark as to hide their own\r\nflagrant crimes. Their method of history writing has been that of\r\nsuppression and distortion of facts.\r\n\r\n(3) The true history of that period reveals some things that place Negro\r\nSuffrage in a remarkably creditable light.\r\n\r\nThe statement has recently been made that \"the reconstruction regime in\r\nthe South worked lasting injury to the colored race.\"[9] Place this\r\nstatement in juxtaposition with a few of the things that were really\r\ndone by these newly enfranchised people who were practicing their first\r\nlessons in the science of government.\r\n\r\nJudge Albion W. Tourgee has stated it thus:\r\n\r\n     \"They obeyed the Constitution of the United States, and annulled\r\n     the bonds of states, counties, and cities which had been issued to\r\n     carry on the war of rebellion and maintain armies in the field\r\n     against the Union. They instituted a public school system in a\r\n     realm where public schools had been unknown. They opened the ballot\r\n     box and jury box to thousands of white men who had been debarred\r\n     from them by a lack of earthly possessions. They introduced home\r\n     rule into the South. They abolished the whipping post, the branding\r\n     iron, the stocks and other barbarous forms of punishment which had\r\n     up to that time prevailed. They reduced capital felonies from about\r\n     twenty to two or three. In an age of extravagance they were\r\n     extravagant in the sums appropriated for public works. In all of\r\n     that time no man's rights of person were invaded under the forms of\r\n     law. Every Democrat's life, home, fireside and business were safe.\r\n     No man obstructed any white man's way to the ballot box, interfered\r\n     with his freedom of speech or boycotted him on account of his\r\n     political faith.\"[10]\r\n\r\nThis is the record which it is said \"has worked lasting injury to the\r\ncolored race.\" If the true history of this period proves anything it is\r\nthis, namely, that the only republican government in fact as well as in\r\nform that has ever existed in the South was when the Negro, though a\r\nmere tyro in the art of government, was a controlling factor in southern\r\npolitics. His \"lasting injury\" consists in the fact that he planted \"the\r\nseeds of all the New South's prosperity.\"\r\n\r\nThe Southern politicians, who in their desperation to perpetuate Negro\r\nSlavery created a national debt of more than three billions and stained\r\nevery vale and hillside with the blood of freemen, point with ineffable\r\nhorror at the extravagant financial legislation of the Reconstruction\r\nperiod. It may be that this much paraded extravagance amounts to more\r\nthan the fiction of distorted facts; but, in view of the audacious\r\ncorruption of the era which preceded it, and the gigantic peculations of\r\nthat which has followed, the financial profligacy of Reconstruction may\r\nnot have been so bad after all.\r\n\r\nReplying to a characteristic speech of Senator Tillman delivered in the\r\nrecent South Carolina Constitutional Convention, in which he arraigned\r\nthe financial legislation of Reconstruction in that State Mr. Thomas E.\r\nMiller, one of the six Negro members of the convention, said:\r\n\r\n     \"The gentleman from Edgefield (Mr. Tillman) speaks of the piling up\r\n     of the State debt; of jobbery and peculation during the period\r\n     between 1869 and 1873 in South Carolina, but he has not found voice\r\n     eloquent enough, nor pen exact enough to mention those imperishable\r\n     gifts bestowed upon South Carolina between 1873 and 1876 by Negro\r\n     legislators--the laws relative to finance, the building of penal\r\n     and charitable institutions, and, greatest of all, the\r\n     establishment of the public school system. Starting as infants in\r\n     legislation in 1869, many wise measures were not thought of, many\r\n     injudicious acts were passed. But in the administration of affairs\r\n     for the next four years, having learned by experience the result of\r\n     bad acts, we immediately passed reformatory laws touching every\r\n     department of state, county, municipal and town governments. These\r\n     enactments are today upon the statute books of South Carolina. They\r\n     stand as living witnesses of the Negro's fitness to vote and\r\n     legislate upon the rights of mankind.\r\n\r\n     \"When we came into power town governments could lend the credit of\r\n     their respective towns to secure funds at any rate of interest that\r\n     the council saw fit to pay. Some of the towns paid as high as 20\r\n     per cent. We passed an act prohibiting town governments from\r\n     pledging the credit of their hamlets for money bearing a greater\r\n     rate of interest than 5 per cent.\r\n\r\n     \"Up to 1874, inclusive, the State Treasurer had the power to pay\r\n     out State funds as he pleased. He could elect whether he would pay\r\n     out the funds on appropriations that would place the money in the\r\n     hands of the peculators, or would apply them to appropriations that\r\n     were honest and necessary. We saw the evil of this and passed an\r\n     act making specific levies and collections of taxes for specific\r\n     appropriations.\r\n\r\n     \"Another source of profligacy in the expenditure of funds was the\r\n     law that provided for and empowered the levying and collecting of\r\n     special taxes by school districts, in the name of the schools. We\r\n     saw its evil and by a constitutional amendment provided that there\r\n     should only be levied and collected annually a tax of two mills for\r\n     school purposes, and took away from the school districts the power\r\n     to levy and to collect taxes of any kind. By this act we cured the\r\n     evils that had been inflicted upon us in the name of the schools,\r\n     settled the public school question for all time to come, and\r\n     established the system upon an honest, financial basis.\r\n\r\n     \"Next, we learned during the period from 1869 to 1874, inclusive,\r\n     that what was denominated the floating indebtedness, covering the\r\n     printing schemes and other indefinite expenditures, amounted to\r\n     nearly $2,000,000. A conference was called of the leading Negro\r\n     representatives in the two houses together with the State\r\n     Treasurer, also a Negro. After this conference we passed an act for\r\n     the purpose of ascertaining the bona fide floating debt and found\r\n     that it did not amount to more than $250,000 for the four years; we\r\n     created a commission to sift that indebtedness and to scale it.\r\n     Hence when the Democratic party came into power they found the\r\n     floating debt covering the legislative and all other expenditures,\r\n     fixed at the certain sum of $250,000. This same class of Negro\r\n     legislators led by the State Treasurer, Mr. F. L. Cardoza, knowing\r\n     that there were millions of fraudulent bonds charged against the\r\n     credit of the state, passed another act to ascertain the true\r\n     bonded indebtedness, and to provide for its settlement. Under this\r\n     law, at one sweep, those entrusted with the power to do so, through\r\n     Negro legislators, stamped six millions of bonds, denominated as\r\n     conversion bonds, \"fraudulent.\" The commission did not finish its\r\n     work before 1876. In that year, when the Hampton government came\r\n     into power, there were still to be examined into and settled under\r\n     the terms of the act passed by us providing for the legitimate\r\n     bonded indebtedness of the state, a little over two and a half\r\n     million dollars worth of bonds and coupons which had not been\r\n     passed upon.\r\n\r\n     \"Governor Hampton, General Hagood, Judge Simonton, Judge Wallace\r\n     and in fact, all of the conservative thinking Democrats aligned\r\n     themselves under the provision enacted by us for the certain and\r\n     final settlement of the bonded indebtedness and appealed to their\r\n     Democratic legislators to stand by the Republican legislation on\r\n     the subject and to confirm it. A faction in the Democratic party\r\n     obtained a majority of the Democrats in the legislature against\r\n     settling the question and they endeavored to open up anew the whole\r\n     subject of the state debt. We had a little over thirty members in\r\n     the house and enough Republican senators to sustain the Hampton\r\n     conservative faction and to stand up for honest finance, or by our\r\n     votes place the debt question of the old state into the hands of\r\n     the plunderers and peculators. We were appealed to by General\r\n     Hagood, through me, and my answer to him was in these words:\r\n     'General, our people have learned the difference between profligate\r\n     and honest legislation. We have passed acts of financial reform,\r\n     and with the assistance of God when the vote shall have been taken,\r\n     you will be able to record for the thirty odd Negroes, slandered\r\n     though they have been through the press, that they voted solidly\r\n     with you all for honest legislation and the preservation of the\r\n     credit of the state.' The thirty odd Negroes in the legislature and\r\n     their senators, by their votes did settle the debt question and\r\n     saved the state $13,000,000. We were eight years in power. We had\r\n     built school houses, established charitable institutions, built and\r\n     maintained the penitentiary system, provided for the education of\r\n     the deaf and dumb, rebuilt the jails and court houses, rebuilt the\r\n     bridges and re-established the ferries. In short, we had\r\n     reconstructed the state and placed it upon the road to prosperity\r\n     and, at the same time, by our acts of financial reform transmitted\r\n     to the Hampton Government an indebtedness not greater by more than\r\n     $2,500,000 than was the bonded debt of the State in 1868, before\r\n     the Republican Negroes and their white allies came into power.\"\r\n\r\nWith the disgraceful dicker of 1877, this era closed, and with it passed\r\naway for a time, whose limit has not yet been fixed, whatever there has\r\nbeen, of republican government in the South. How the overthrow of\r\nReconstruction government was accomplished is well-known. The\r\nsignificance of its overthrow is that it marked the arrogant reassertion\r\nof the malignant and desperate purpose of the southern oligarchy,\r\ntrained in the absolutism of slave mastery, to despoil the Negro of the\r\nrights of citizenship, and to reduce him to a state of serfdom.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation for the execution of this infamous purpose, they\r\nattempted and succeeded in accomplishing what does great credit to the\r\nsheer audacity of southern political leadership. By sublime\r\ndissimulation they hoodwinked the other sections of the country in\r\nregard to the South's attitude to the Negro. Their first maneuver was\r\nto give the Negro a bad reputation and denounce as mischievous meddlers\r\nthose who insisted that he be dealt with justly. The Southern oligarchy\r\nput forward its youngest and best men. Its first point of attack was\r\nMassachusetts; and thither went Grady and Gordon and Watterson who with\r\npersuasive accent plead the cause of the \"New South.\" With charming\r\nrecklessness of statement, they proclaimed the era of sectional\r\nfraternity and with consummate cunning set forth in the next breath to\r\neastern capitalists the industrial possibilities of the South. Gradually\r\nthey reached the climax of their mission, to wit: Leave the Negro to us:\r\nwe are his friends, his natural guardians: we know him better than you\r\ndo, and can more wisely fix his status in our social scheme. Then the\r\nold, old story was repeated with endless refrain, of the Negro's\r\nignorance, criminal tendencies (fully attested by timely news dispatches\r\nfrom the South), of his inferiority, and of the menace he is to\r\nAnglo-Saxon domination.\r\n\r\nThus while the sons of slave masters were poisoning the minds of the\r\nnorth and west, the slave drivers were at home perfecting the conspiracy\r\nagainst Negro citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe year 1890 witnessed the beginning of the execution of this\r\nconspiracy which promises to continue until the Negro is divested of\r\nevery right which is worth the having. In 1890 a minority of the people\r\nof the state of Mississippi arrogated to themselves the right to despoil\r\nthe majority of the citizens of that state of the rights of free men by\r\nnullifying the Fifteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nBefore considering the new constitutions of the States of Mississippi,\r\nSouth Carolina and Louisiana, and the decisions of courts respecting\r\nthem, I have deemed it proper to review the history of Negro Suffrage\r\nand to indicate the unvarying attitude of the ruling classes of the\r\nSouth towards it. In the light of this history, let us now briefly\r\nexamine these recent enactments in their relation to the political\r\nrights of the Negro.\r\n\r\nIt is no secret that the avowed purpose of the framers of these\r\ninstruments was to deprive the Negro of the right to vote. Their purpose\r\nis not more startling than is the defiance with which they have hurled\r\nit from the housetops. This purpose they claim to have accomplished by\r\ntaking advantage of the ignorance and poverty of the Negro; but the most\r\ncursory glance at these enactments will convince any one that neither\r\nintelligence nor wealth constitutes the basis of electoral qualification\r\nunder them, while the confessions of the framers of them as well as\r\ntheir operation proves that neither ignorance nor poverty serves to\r\ndisqualify.\r\n\r\nIn Mississippi a Negro may be as rich as Dives and as wise as Solomon\r\nand yet he may not be able to satisfy an ignorant and partisan\r\nregistration officer that he is qualified to be an elector; while a\r\nwhite man may be as poor as Lazarus and may not possess the intellectual\r\noutfit of a Hottentot and yet he will experience no difficulty in\r\nconvincing the same individual that he is qualified to exercise all the\r\nrights and privileges of that class whose \"destiny it is to dominate.\"\r\nThis is the sort of educational qualifications these great\r\nconstitutional documents prescribe!\r\n\r\nHow to disfranchise the Negro by an educational test without at the same\r\ntime disfranchising a very large number of white men, was at first a\r\nproblem that presented many difficulties to the framers of the\r\nMississippi document. Such a problem, however, cannot long remain a\r\ndifficult one to men who are masters of the art of legalizing fraud.\r\n\r\nThat the illiterate white vote might not, by the play of accident,\r\nbecome eliminated by an educational test, it was provided that that part\r\nof the constitution which prescribes it, was not to go into operation\r\nuntil one year after the adoption of the constitution. Before the\r\nexpiration of that time another standard of qualification was provided\r\nand all who qualified under it were not to be affected by the subsequent\r\noperation of the educational test.\r\n\r\nThis latter provision is as follows, being section 241 of Article 12 of\r\nthe constitution of Mississippi, defining who are electors:\r\n\r\n     \"Every male inhabitant of the state, except idiots, insane persons,\r\n     and Indians not taxed, who is a citizen of the United States,\r\n     twenty-one years of age and upwards, who has resided in the state\r\n     two years, and one year in the election district * * * in which he\r\n     offers to vote and who is duly registered as provided in this\r\n     article, and who has never been convicted of bribery, burglary,\r\n     theft, arson, obtaining money or goods under false pretense,\r\n     perjury, embezzlement, or bigamy, and who has paid on or before the\r\n     first day of February of the year in which he offers to vote, all\r\n     taxes which may have been legally required of him and who shall\r\n     produce to the officer holding the election satisfactory evidence\r\n     that he has paid his taxes.\"\r\n\r\nUnder this section of the Mississippi constitution, the white population\r\nof that state qualified as electors. But to prevent the Negroes from\r\nqualifying, section 242 of Article 12, further provides that persons\r\noffering to register shall take the following oath:\r\n\r\n     \"I do solemnly swear that I am twenty one years old and that I will\r\n     have resided in the state two years and (this) election district\r\n     for one year preceding the ensuing election, and am now in good\r\n     faith a resident of the same, and that I am not disqualified from\r\n     voting by reason of having been convicted of any of the crimes\r\n     mentioned in the constitution of this state as a disqualification\r\n     to be an elector, that I will truly answer _all questions\r\n     propounded to me concerning my antecedents so far as they relate to\r\n     my right to vote_ and also as to _my residence before my citizenship\r\n     in this district_, that I will support the constitution of the\r\n     United States and of the state of Mississippi and will bear true\r\n     faith and allegiance to the same--so help me God.\r\n\r\n     Any willful and corrupt false statement in said affidavit or in\r\n     answer to any material question propounded as herein authorized\r\n     shall be perjury.\"\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing provisions attention is called to the following:\r\n\r\n(1) The crimes mentioned as disqualifying from voting are such as it is\r\nalways easy, when desirable, to convict the Negro of committing. Under\r\nthe present method of administering justice in the states where these\r\ndisfranchising constitutions operate, the Negro has neither any\r\nguarantee of a fair and impartial trial nor any protection against\r\nmalicious prosecution or false accusations when it is convenient to\r\nconvict him.\r\n\r\n(2) The penalty for not paying taxes almost a year before election day\r\nis a disqualification from voting. But this of course is not the sole\r\npenalty. Whether he is a qualified elector or not, every man must in the\r\ncase of real property pay his taxes, or suffer the loss of his property,\r\nand certainly no man, not even the poorest of the Negroes and poor\r\nwhites, can escape the obligation of the poll tax by a mere forfeiture\r\nof his right to vote.[11] Thus the penalty for not paying taxes is\r\ntwofold in so far as the Negro is concerned. The poor white man may or\r\nmay not experience any difficulty about producing \"to the officer\r\nholding the election satisfactory evidence that he has paid his taxes.\"\r\n\r\n(3) The Negro who may desire to vote must answer under oath not certain\r\nspecific interrogatories concerning his antecedents and former places of\r\nresidence, but to \"truly answer all questions propounded\" to him, with\r\nthe understanding that the slightest mistake will be construed as a\r\ncorrupt and willful false statement exposing him to prosecution for\r\nperjury, thus rendering him everlastingly disqualified to vote.\r\n\r\nWhen, under the foregoing provision the white male inhabitants of the\r\nstate became qualified electors, the following provision, being section\r\n244 of article 12 of the constitution of Mississippi, went into\r\noperation:\r\n\r\n     \"On and after the first day of January, 1892, every elector in\r\n     addition to the foregoing qualifications, shall be able to read any\r\n     section of the constitution of this state; or shall be able to\r\n     understand the same when read to him, or give a reasonable\r\n     interpretation thereof.\"\r\n\r\nThis section contains the so-called educational test, and the elector's\r\nqualifications under it are determined by a registration officer whose\r\ndiscretion is as limitless as his prejudices. The registration officers\r\nof South Carolina acting under a similar provision of the constitution\r\nof that state required the Negroes who offered themselves for\r\nregistration to understand and explain section 4 of article 5 of the\r\nconstitution of South Carolina, which is as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The supreme courts shall have power to issue writs or orders of\r\n     injunctions, mandamus, quo warranto, prohibition, certiorari,\r\n     habeas corpus, and other original and remedial writs, etc.\"\r\n\r\nFearing apparently that these provisions of the constitution might not\r\nprove a sufficient barrier to the Negro's intellect and cunning, the\r\nlegislature of Mississippi has gone the full length of the power granted\r\nit, in its efforts to keep the Negro from voting. Section 3643 of the\r\ncode of 1892 of that state, which regulates the appointment of managers\r\nof elections, contains this remarkably clever provision:\r\n\r\n     \"The Commissions shall appoint three persons to be managers of\r\n     election, who shall not be of the same political party, _if\r\n     suitable persons of different political parties can be had in the\r\n     district_.\"\r\n\r\nImagine commissioners of election of the Mississippi type regarding a\r\nNegro, or a white man known to be favorable to Negro suffrage, as a\r\n\"suitable person!\"\r\n\r\nOne would suppose that the elector having successfully passed the ordeal\r\nof the registration officer would be allowed smooth sailing during the\r\nremainder of the voyage to the polls. But no; having passed Scylla, he\r\nmust encounter Charybdis at the very brink of the ballot box; for\r\nsection 3644 of the above mentioned Code provides that any of the\r\nmanagers of election\r\n\r\n     \"May examine on oath any person duly registered and offering to\r\n     vote touching his qualifications as an elector.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of the constitution of Mississippi is to set up a standard of\r\nqualification of a much higher intellectual scale than that of any of\r\nthe most enlightened states in the Union and to deprive a hundred and\r\neighty thousand citizens of the elective franchise previously enjoyed by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe attempt is often made by southern politicians of the dominant class\r\nto justify the Mississippi plan of disfranchisement by pointing to the\r\nfact that Massachusetts, a northern state, has provided for a qualified\r\nsuffrage by the adoption of an educational test. But compared with the\r\nMississippi provision that of Massachusetts is as modest and simple as\r\nthe average Mississippi school house.\r\n\r\nAmendment XX to the Massachusetts Constitution is as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"No person shall have the right to vote, or be eligible to office\r\n     under the constitution of this commonwealth, who shall not be able\r\n     to read the constitution in the English language, and write his\r\n     name. _Provided however_, that the provisions of this amendment\r\n     shall not apply to any person prevented by physical disability from\r\n     complying with its requisition, _Nor to any person, who now has the\r\n     right to vote_, nor to any person who shall be sixty years of age\r\n     or upwards at the time this amendment shall take effect.\"\r\n\r\nThus Massachusetts requires that those wishing to exercise the elective\r\nfranchise in the future must be able merely to read the English\r\nlanguage; and expends annually more than four dollars per capita to\r\neducate them; while Mississippi requires, not only future electors, but\r\nthose who have previously exercised the right to vote to give \"_a\r\nreasonable interpretation_\" to the satisfaction of a registration\r\nofficer, and expends annually less than one dollar per capita for\r\neducation!\r\n\r\nHere it may be well to state that, although the idea of a qualified\r\nsuffrage grew out of the desire and the necessity to prepare the foreign\r\nborn element of our population, aliens to our institutions and language,\r\nfor an intelligent exercise of the ballot, the Negro does not make\r\nobjection or complaint to a just and fair educational test of his\r\nfitness to exercise the right of suffrage. Absolutely loyal to\r\nrepublical institutions, he is willing to go as far as any in the matter\r\nof fairly and justly protecting the ballot from abuses that grow out of\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of Mississippi has served as the pattern for the\r\ndisfranchising enactments of South Carolina and Louisiana. The main\r\nprovision in the South Carolina Constitution regulating suffrage is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"Up to January 1, 1898, all male persons of voting age applying for\r\n     registration, who can read any section of this constitution\r\n     submitted to them, _or understand and explain it_ when read to them\r\n     by the registration officer, shall be entitled to registration and\r\n     become electors.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the understanding and interpreting clause of\r\nthe foregoing operates the reverse of that of the Constitution of\r\nMississippi. The South Carolina provision was limited to cease after\r\nJanuary 1, 1898, while that of Mississippi was limited to begin January\r\n1, 1892 and to continue thereafter without ceasing.\r\n\r\nSubdivision (d) of the above mentioned section of the South Carolina\r\nConstitution provides as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Any person who shall apply for registration after January 1, 1898,\r\n     if otherwise qualified, shall be registered: _Provided_ that he can\r\n     both read and write any section of the constitution submitted to\r\n     him by the registration officer or can show that he owns and has\r\n     paid taxes collectible during the previous year on property in this\r\n     state assessed at three hundred dollars ($300) or more.\"\r\n\r\nSubdivision (c) of the South Carolina law effected the disfranchisement\r\nof more than one hundred thousand electors who had passed the legal age\r\nof attending school. But for this fact, the provision of subdivision (d)\r\nif fairly applied could meet with no objection. However, it cannot be\r\nabsolutely fair as long as South Carolina expends less money per capita\r\nin the education of its Negro population than in the education of its\r\nwhite population. The report of the Superintendent of Education of South\r\nCarolina shows that it has cost $4.23 per capita to educate the white\r\nchildren of the state and only $1.35 per capita to educate the colored\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nWhen the present Constitution of South Carolina was in process of\r\nconstruction, the Supreme Court of the United States had not passed upon\r\nthe legality of the so-called educational provision of the Mississippi\r\nConstitution, and the possibility that it might in the near future\r\ndeclare all such enactments repugnant to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates deterred the members of the South Carolina constitutional\r\nconvention from going the full length of the Mississippi plan. Although\r\nthey had assembled for no other purpose than to disfranchise the Negro,\r\nyet out of fear of the Fifteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution,\r\nthey failed to do all they purposed.\r\n\r\nGeorge L. Tillman, the brother of the present United States Senator from\r\nthat state, spoke in the convention the following significant and\r\npathetic words:\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. President, we can all hope a great deal from the constitution\r\n     we have adopted. It is not such an instrument as we would have made\r\n     had we been a free people. We are not a free people; we have not\r\n     been since the war. I fear it will be some time before we can call\r\n     ourselves free. I have had that fact very painfully impressed upon\r\n     me for several years. _If we were free, instead of having Negro\r\n     suffrage we would have Negro slavery; instead of having the United\r\n     States Government we would have the Confederate States Government;\r\n     instead of paying $300,000 pension tribute we would be receiving\r\n     it._\"[12]\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of Louisiana, in its attempt to disfranchise the Negro\r\nand enfranchise, so to speak, every other class of men, the ignorant\r\nscum of Europe, as well as the intelligent and illiterate native born\r\nwhites, outdoes both Mississippi and South Carolina. It adopts\r\npractically the same educational and property qualifications as are\r\ncontained in the Mississippi and South Carolina instruments. The fifth\r\nsection of it furnishes a true index to the spirit which is behind all\r\nof these disfranchising enactments. With vindictive memory, the framers\r\nof the Louisiana Constitution qualified as electors all who were\r\nentitled to vote on January 1, 1867 or at any date prior thereto as well\r\nas the sons and grandsons of such persons, whether or not they possess\r\nintelligence or property. Herein they display the same spirit which\r\nrefused to accord to the Negro the right to vote previous to 1867.\r\n\r\nWhat has been the attitude of the Courts towards these enactments which\r\nin the interest of oligarchy have set aside republican governments in\r\nthe South and nullified the Constitution of the United States?\r\n\r\nNaturally, the state courts have upheld them. The most remarkable\r\njudicial utterance since the famous Dred Scott decision is that of the\r\nsupreme court of Mississippi in the case of Ratliff vs. Beale,\r\npredicated upon the constitution of Mississippi respecting the elective\r\nfranchise. The Court said:\r\n\r\n     \"Within the field of permissible action, under the limitations\r\n     imposed by the Federal Constitution, the convention swept the\r\n     circle of expedients to obstruct the exercise of the franchise by\r\n     the Negro race. By reason of its previous condition of servitude\r\n     and dependence, this race had acquired or accentuated certain\r\n     peculiarities of habit, of temperament, and character, which\r\n     clearly distinguished it as a race from that of the whites--a\r\n     patient, docile people, careless, landless, and migratory within\r\n     narrow limits, without forethought, and its criminal members given\r\n     rather to furtive offenses than to the robust crimes of the whites.\r\n     _Restrained by the Federal Constitution from discriminating against\r\n     the Negro race, the convention discriminated against its\r\n     characteristics and the offenses to which its weaker members were\r\n     prone._\"[13]\r\n\r\nThus a court created by this new constitution of Mississippi declares\r\nthat it, in spite of the Fifteenth Amendment, discriminates against the\r\nNegro race \"by reason of its previous condition of servitude and\r\ndependence,\" and at the same time upholds that instrument.\r\n\r\nThe constitutionality of these disfranchising enactments has not been\r\nmade a direct issue in the Supreme Court of the United States. The case\r\nof Williams vs. State of Mississippi[14], the decision of which is\r\ncommonly supposed to have sustained their constitutionality, only\r\nbrought the question up collaterally without proper allegations or\r\nsufficient proof. From an intimation made by the Court in this case, it\r\nis not improbable that when a direct issue upon their constitutionality\r\nis properly presented, it may render a decision consonant with that\r\nwhich it rendered in the case of Yick Wo vs. Hopkins, wherein the Court\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     \"Though the law in itself be fair on its face and impartial in\r\n     appearance, yet, if it be applied and administered by public\r\n     authority with an evil eye and an unequal hand, so as to\r\n     practically make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons\r\n     in similar circumstances, material to their rights, the denial of\r\n     equal justice is still within the prohibition of the\r\n     Constitution.\"[15]\r\n\r\nThere are other grounds for the belief that the Federal Supreme Court\r\nwill refuse to sustain these instruments of disfranchisement, even\r\nthough it has not of recent years acted in a manner to inspire faith.\r\n\r\nThese enactments have never received the approval of the people of the\r\nstates. Of a total of 235,604 male citizens of voting age in South\r\nCarolina in 1890, more than 102,000 of whom were white men, only 60,925\r\nparticipated in the election of November 6, 1894, at which the members\r\nof the constitutional convention were elected. Of the number thus voting\r\nonly 31,402 were counted in favor of holding the convention. Thus\r\none-seventh of the citizens called a convention and enacted a\r\nconstitution which disfranchised more than one hundred thousand\r\nelectors. The constitutions of Mississippi and Louisiana were adopted in\r\nthe same way.\r\n\r\nThese so called constitutions, besides being repugnant to the spirit and\r\npurpose of the Fifteenth Amendment are also violative of the acts of\r\nCongress restoring the rebellious states to the Union, which acts the\r\nFederal Supreme Court has on several occasions declared\r\nconstitutional.[16]\r\n\r\nPursuant to the reconstruction legislation, these states adopted\r\nconstitutions admitting the Negro to the ballot and then asked to be\r\nreadmitted to representation in Congress. Congress, having approved of\r\ntheir constitutions, enacted that they be entitled to representation in\r\nCongress, \"upon the following _fundamental_ conditions: That the\r\nconstitutions of neither of said states shall ever be so amended or\r\nchanged as to deprive any citizen or class of citizens of the United\r\nStates of the right to vote in said states, who are entitled to vote by\r\nthe constitution thereof herein recognized.\"[17]\r\n\r\nThese states accepted these fundamental conditions and are consequently\r\nbound by them.[18]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWhat effect have these disfranchising enactments had upon the status of\r\nthe Negro? Has he lost nothing more than the bare right to vote? Has he\r\nbeen deprived of nothing but an abstract right to a voice in the affairs\r\nof government and of no other privilege than the possibility of a share\r\nof political power?\r\n\r\nSurely the loss of any one of the foregoing is not unimportant in a\r\ndemocratic form of government. But he has lost much more, and the\r\nprobabilities are that, if these obvious discriminations are allowed to\r\ncontinue, he will be brought to his deepest humiliation. The law which\r\ndeprives him of the badge of citizenship, changes at once his legal\r\nstatus and cuts him off from respect. His disqualification as an elector\r\nshuts him out of the jury box in courts where what few rights he has\r\nleft are adjudicated and his grievances redressed. His disqualification\r\nas an elector and as a juror discredits him as a witness. In the states\r\nwhich have adopted these disfranchising constitutions, more than three\r\nhundred thousand citizens have been thereby disqualified as jurors. This\r\nis all the more outrageous, because in the same states advantage has\r\nbeen taken in criminal legislation of what the Supreme Court of\r\nMississippi has termed \"certain peculiarities of habit and character of\r\nthe Negro\" whereby \"furtive offenses,\" which in other communities are\r\ntreated as mere misdemeanors, are made felonies and are usually visited\r\nwith greater punishment than are the \"robust crimes\" of the whites. In\r\nSouth Carolina, for instance, the breach of a labor contract has been\r\nmade a crime, the object being to reduce the Negro to a state of\r\nserfdom.\r\n\r\nNot only has the legal status of the Negro been gravely affected by\r\nthese disfranchising enactments; his economic status has also been\r\nlowered. A Mississippian states the following as the reason for\r\ndisfranchising the Negro in his state:\r\n\r\n     \"It is a question of political economy which the people of the\r\n     North can not realize nor understand _and which they have no right\r\n     to discuss as they have no power to determine_. If the Negro is\r\n     permitted to engage in politics his usefulness as a laborer is at\r\n     an end. _He can no longer be controlled or utilized._ The South has\r\n     to deal with him as an industrial and economic factor and _is\r\n     forced to assert its control over him in sheer self-defense_.\"[19]\r\n\r\nThus Negro labor must be managed, and control must be asserted over him.\r\nHis possession of the ballot would make him a free laborer and would\r\nenable him to demand the wages of free labor. It is truly an \"economic\r\nproblem,\" in which not only the Negro of the South is concerned, but\r\nalso the interests of free labor in every section of this country.\r\n\r\nThese disfranchising enactments in that they lower the legal and\r\neconomic status of the black man, also tend to lower his educational and\r\nsocial status. The political and economic supremacy of the southern\r\noligarchy is dependent upon the ignorance and the social degradation of\r\nthe Negro. It is, therefore, not surprising that the politicians now\r\ndominant in the South assert that education disqualifies him as a field\r\nhand,--as a manageable factor,--and that consequently there must be a\r\ndecrease in the amount of money expended for his education or that his\r\neducation must be directed along lines which will make him more\r\nadaptable to management as an economic factor for their sole benefit.\r\nThe educated Negro is not more desirable now than he was fifty years\r\nago. It is a marvel how the great body of southern white people, a great\r\nmany of whom are favorable to the advancement of the Negro, will permit\r\nmen of the type of the average politicians who now exercise control\r\namong them to stand thus in the way of the true progress of the South.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is asserted that the right to vote destroys his usefulness as\r\na laborer; then, that education turns his head and makes him\r\ndiscontented with the plantation where wages reach the high water mark\r\nof six dollars a month, which may or may not be paid according to the\r\nwhim of his employer; and finally that the privilege of respectable\r\naccommodations furnished by common carriers which enjoy unusual public\r\nfranchises makes him impudent, noisy and self-respecting, the proper\r\nremedy for which is a system of \"Jim Crow Cars.\" Thus with the passing\r\naway of the Negro's right to vote, begins the reappearance of the odious\r\nsystem of Black Laws which are designed to degrade the womanhood and\r\nmanhood of the Negro race. The whole trend of southern legislation is to\r\nfix what has been termed the \"proper status of the Negro--subordination\r\nto the superior race.\" Not a single line has been written upon the\r\nstatute books of a single southern state within the last decade in\r\nrecognition of the Negro as a man entitled to respect, or fair and just\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, Mr. Lincoln uttered the following words in reference to\r\nslavery, which are not wanting in significance in their bearing upon the\r\npresent assault upon the Negro:\r\n\r\n     \"To aid in making the bondage of the Negro universal and eternal,\r\n     it (the Declaration of Independence) is assailed and sneered at,\r\n     construed and hawked at and torn, till, if the framers could rise\r\n     from their graves, they would hardly recognize it. All the powers\r\n     of earth seem combined against him. Ambition follows, philosophy\r\n     follows, and the theology of the day is fast joining in the cry.\r\n     They have him in his prison house; they have searched his person\r\n     and left no prying instrument with him; and now they have him as it\r\n     were bolted with a lock of a hundred keys which can never be\r\n     unlocked, except by the concurrence of every key in the hands of a\r\n     hundred different men and they scattered to a hundred different\r\n     places. And now they stand musing as to what invention in all the\r\n     domain of mind and matter can be produced to make the impossibility\r\n     of his escape more complete than it is.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe nation can not put up with many more of these instruments of\r\ndisfranchisement. It can not endure the present ones very much longer.\r\nThe question is ceasing to be one of interest merely to the Negro; it is\r\nrapidly becoming one of national moment. It is becoming a contest\r\nbetween democracy and oligarchy in which the stability and integrity of\r\nrepublican institutions are involved. Already a few thousand minions of\r\noligarchy are exerting a larger influence in the national government\r\nthan do millions of freemen who are obeying the Federal Constitution by\r\nmaintaining a republican form of government. The election returns from\r\nthe three states of Louisiana, South Carolina and Mississippi show how\r\nstartling is the power which they exercise in Congress by reason of\r\nthese disfranchising instruments. The following shows the number of\r\nvotes polled in these states for members of Congress in 1898 and in the\r\ncase of Louisiana the votes polled may be compared with the returns of\r\n1896 when the old constitution was in force:\r\n\r\n  LOUISIANA\r\n\r\n  District.

The total vote cast in the twenty congressional districts of\r\nSouth Carolina, Louisiana, and Mississippi in the election of 1898 was\r\n91,184; while that polled in the ten congressional districts of\r\nWisconsin was 332,204. Thus, although these states cast nearly two\r\nhundred and fifty thousand votes less than the state of Wisconsin, they\r\ncontrol twice as much power as that state in the national legislature.\r\n\r\nThe southern people themselves can not permit these violent\r\ninfringements of the principles of republican government to continue\r\nwithout irrevocable detriment to their best and highest interests. In\r\nthe degree that they stand by in silence and see the Negro stripped of\r\nhis civil and political rights by a band of unscrupulous men who seek\r\nno higher end than their personal aggrandizement, they compromise their\r\nown civil and political freedom, and put in jeopardy the industrial\r\nprogress of the south. The bane of the South today is her selfish and\r\nmisguided political leadership, the men who will not scruple to\r\nsacrifice upon the altars of their insatiable ambition for power every\r\ninterest linked with her economic prosperity and all consideration for\r\ncivic virtue by which alone the greatness of a people is measured.\r\n\r\nHer misfortune lies not in any danger from Negro domination, for of all\r\nthe classes of her population the Negro is the least capable of working\r\nher injury and the least disposed to do so. Her real danger lies in the\r\npernicious activity of her dominant political leaders who perpetuate\r\ntheir control by overriding local and national authority to the\r\ndiminution of both public and private security. Law has been dethroned\r\nand the respectable and industrious portion of the people must witness\r\nthe spectacle and endure the humiliation of riot, bloodshed, and\r\nassassination with impunity of innocent and unoffending citizens by the\r\nbeneficiaries under these disfranchising constitutions.\r\n\r\nThe leading paper of the state of Louisiana, which threw the weight of\r\nits influence in favor of the constitutional convention which was held\r\nfor the sole and avowed purpose of disfranchising the Negro, has\r\nrecently made the following important confession:\r\n\r\n     \"Assassination is still the order of the day and night in\r\n     Tangipahoa Parish. William McGee, a white man, employed at a saw\r\n     mill was the victim. He was waylaid yesterday morning and fired\r\n     upon, with the result that he was badly hurt. A posse turned out\r\n     with dogs to find the murderers, but to no purpose, although the\r\n     posse was fired on several times out of ambush. The authorities in\r\n     that parish seem incapable of making arrests of the perpetrators of\r\n     these numerous assassinations that occur among them, but when by\r\n     some chance an arrest is made, no jury is found that will convict.\r\n     The result is that outlaws have everything their own way, while the\r\n     peaceable people have no assurance that at any moment they will not\r\n     be murdered by cowardly assassins.\"[20]\r\n\r\nThus it is that the southern white people, by permitting a few desperate\r\npoliticians to outlaw the Negro, find themselves at the mercy of an\r\noligarchy which has everything its own way.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census of 1890, there are 102,657 white male citizens\r\nof voting age in South Carolina and 132,947 colored male citizens of\r\nvoting age, making a total of 253,604 male citizens who were entitled to\r\nvote in that year. The election returns from that state for November\r\n1898 show that the highest total vote polled for any office was only\r\n28,258, averaging less than eight hundred votes to each county, thus\r\nshowing that less than one eighth of the male citizens have it in their\r\npower to control the administration and policies of the state.\r\n\r\nIf by a mere technicality one class of citizens can be deprived of the\r\nrights and immunities guaranteed by the organic law of the nation, what\r\nis to prevent any other class from sharing the same fate? If less than\r\none fourth of the male citizens of Mississippi can usurp the right to\r\nexclusively manage the local government, what is to prevent a smaller\r\nproportion from doing the same? If it is possible for a minority of the\r\npeople of Alabama to disfranchise one class of citizens on account of\r\nrace without the consent of the majority, what is to prevent the\r\ndisfranchisement of any other class on account of _political_ views?\r\nSouthern white men who view with apprehension these untoward political\r\ntendencies, who are alarmed at the passing away of the last vestiges of\r\na republican form of government from that section of our Union, and who\r\nsilently condemn and deplore the outrageous and inexcusable manner in\r\nwhich the black man is being divested of his political and civil rights\r\nfor mere party advantage, must seriously and actively face the\r\nsituation, if they would save the south from the shame and the\r\nhumiliation with which she is threatened, and which she has already too\r\nkeenly experienced at the hands of a profligate leadership.\r\n\r\nThere is a dormant statesmanship in the south that must and will exert\r\nitself mightily, \"a moral and intellectual intelligence which is not\r\ngoing to be much longer beguiled out of its moral right of way by\r\nquestions of political punctilio, but will seek that plane of universal\r\njustice and equity which it is every people's duty before God to seek.\"\r\n\r\nBut the question is not a sectional one. The whole American people are\r\ndeeply concerned in it. Nullification in South Carolina is as great a\r\nnational menace today as it proved to be half a century ago. Republican\r\ninstitutions and the national welfare can have no guarantee or\r\nprotection against the evil consequences threatened by defiant trampling\r\nupon constitutional authority. Not in its most palmy days did the slave\r\nsystem possess such power as is aimed at by these latter day nullifiers.\r\nHaving shorn the Negro of his political rights and brought him into\r\nindustrial subjection, thereby usurping power both in state and national\r\ngovernment, they now threaten to dominate the economic and industrial\r\npolicies of the nation.\r\n\r\nThis government can not long continue half republican in form and half\r\noligarchic.\r\n\r\nJOHN L.
