It embodies a menace of national\r\n    disintegration and destruction.\r\n\r\n                                                   GARRET A. HOBART.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was a terrible night for the great City of New York—the night of\r\nTuesday, November 3rd, 1896. The city staggered under the blow like a\r\nhuge ocean liner which plunges, full speed, with terrific crash into a\r\nmighty iceberg, and recoils shattered and trembling like an aspen.\r\n\r\nThe people were gathered, light-hearted and confident, at the evening\r\nmeal, when the news burst upon them. It was like a thunder bolt out of\r\nan azure sky: “Altgeld holds Illinois hard and fast in the Democratic\r\nline. This elects Bryan President of the United States!”\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the people in the upper portion of the city made no\r\nmovement to rush out of their houses and collect in the public squares,\r\nalthough the night was clear and beautiful. They sat as if paralyzed\r\nwith a nameless dread, and when they conversed it was with bated breath\r\nand throbbing hearts.\r\n\r\nIn less than half an hour, mounted policemen dashed through the streets\r\ncalling out: “Keep within your houses; close your doors and barricade\r\nthem. The entire East side is in a state of uproar. Mobs of vast size\r\nare organizing under the lead of Anarchists and Socialists, and threaten\r\nto plunder and despoil the houses of the rich who have wronged and\r\noppressed them for so many years. Keep within doors. Extinguish all\r\nlights.”\r\n\r\nHappily, Governor Morton was in town, and although a deeper pallor\r\novercame the ashen hue of age as he spoke, yet there was no tremor in\r\nhis voice: “Let the Seventh, Twenty-second and Seventy-first regiments\r\nbe ordered under arms.” In a few moments hundreds of messengers could be\r\nheard racing through the silent streets, summoning the members of these\r\nregiments to their Armories.\r\n\r\nSlowly, but with astonishing nerve and steadiness, the mobs pushed the\r\npolice northward, and although the force stood the onslaught with\r\nmagnificent courage, yet beaten back, the dark masses of infuriated\r\nbeings surged up again with renewed fury and strength. Will the troops\r\nbe in time to save the city? was the whispered inquiry among the knots\r\nof police officials who were directing the movements of their men.\r\n\r\nAbout nine o’clock, with deafening outcries, the mob, like a four-headed\r\nmonster breathing fire and flame, raced, tore, burst, raged into Union\r\nSquare.\r\n\r\nThe police force was exhausted, but their front was still like a wall of\r\nstone, save that it was movable. The mob crowded it steadily to the\r\nnorth, while the air quivered and was rent with mad vociferations of the\r\nvictors: “Bryan is elected! Bryan is elected! Our day has come at last.\r\nDown with our oppressors! Death to the rich man! Death to the gold bugs!\r\nDeath to the capitalists! Give us back the money you have ground out of\r\nus. Give us back the marrow of our bones which you have used to grease\r\nthe wheels of your chariots.”\r\n\r\nThe police force was now almost helpless. The men still used their\r\nsticks, but the blows were ineffectual, and only served to increase the\r\nrage of the vast hordes now advancing upon Madison Square.\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Avenue Hotel will be the first to feel the fury of the mob.\r\nWould the troops be in time to save it?\r\n\r\nA half cheer, a half cry of joy goes up. It is inarticulate. Men draw a\r\nlong breath; women drop upon their knees and strain their eyes; they can\r\nhear something, but they cannot see as yet, for the gas houses and\r\nelectric plants had been destroyed by the mob early in the evening. They\r\npreferred to fight in the dark, or by the flames of rich men’s abodes.\r\n\r\nAgain a cheer goes up, louder and clearer this time, followed by cries\r\nof “They’re coming, they’re coming.”\r\n\r\nYes, they were coming—the Twenty-second down Broadway, the Seventh down\r\nMadison avenue, both on the double quick.\r\n\r\nIn a moment or so there were a few bugle calls, and a few spoken\r\ncommands rang out clear and sharp; and then the two regiments stretched\r\nacross the entire square, literally from wall to wall, in line of\r\nbattle. The mob was upon them. Would this slender line of troops, could\r\nit hold such a mighty mass of men in check?\r\n\r\nThe answer was a deafening discharge of firearms, a terrific crack, such\r\nas some thunder bolts make when they explode. A wall of fire blazed\r\nacross the Square. Again and again it blazed forth. The mob halted,\r\nstood fast, wavered, fell back, advanced again. At that moment there\r\ncame a rattle as of huge knives in the distance. It was the gallant\r\nSeventy-first charging up Twenty-third street, and taking the mob on the\r\nflank. They came on like a wall of iron, bristling with blades of steel.\r\n\r\nThere were no outcries, no cheers from the regiment. It dealt out death\r\nin silence, save when two bayonets crossed and clashed in bearing down\r\nsome doubly-vigorous foe.\r\n\r\nAs the bells rang out midnight, the last remnants of the mob were driven\r\nto cover, but the wheels of the dead wagons rattled till daybreak.\r\n\r\nAnd then the aged Governor, in response to the Mayor’s “Thank God, we’ve\r\nsaved the city!” made answer:\r\n\r\n“Aye, but the Republic——.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat as has been the world’s wonder at the uprising of Mr. Bryan’s\r\n“struggling masses” in the city by the sea, and the narrow escape of its\r\nmagnificent homes from fire and brand, yet greater still was the\r\nwonderment when the news was flashed across the land that Chicago did\r\nnot stand in need of a single Federal soldier.\r\n\r\n“Chicago is mad, but it is the madness of joy. Chicago is in the hands\r\nof a mob, but it is a mob made up of her own people—noisy, rude and\r\nboisterous, the natural exultation of a suddenly enfranchised class; but\r\nbent on no other mischief than glorying over the villainous and\r\nself-seeking souls who have ground the faces of the poor and turned the\r\npitiless screw of social and political power into the hearts of the\r\n‘common people’ until its last thread had been reached, and despair\r\npressed its lupine visage hard against the door of the laboring man.”\r\n\r\nAnd yet, at this moment when the night air quivered with the mad\r\nvociferations of the “common people,” that the Lord had been good to\r\nthem; that the wicked money-changers had been driven from the temple,\r\nthat the stony-hearted usurers were beaten at last, that the “People’s\r\nWilliam” was at the helm now, that peace and plenty would in a few moons\r\ncome back to the poor man’s cottage, that Silver was King, aye, King at\r\nlast, the world still went wondering why red-eyed anarchy, as she stood\r\nin Haymarket Square, with thin arms aloft, with wild mien and wilder\r\ngesticulation, drew no bomb of dynamite from her bosom, to hurl at the\r\nhated minions of the law who were silent spectators of this delirium of\r\npopular joy.\r\n\r\nWhy was it thus? Look and you shall know why white robed peace kept step\r\nwith this turbulent band and turned its thought from red handed pillage.\r\nHe was there. The master spirit to hold them in leash. He, and he alone,\r\nhad lifted Bryan to his great eminence. Without these twenty-four\r\nelectoral votes, Bryan had been doomed, hopelessly doomed. He, and he\r\nalone, held the great Commonwealth of the West hard and fast in the\r\nDemocratic line; hence he came as conqueror, as King-maker, and the very\r\nwalls of the sky-touching edifices trembled as he was dragged through\r\nthe crowded streets by this orderly mob, and ten times ten thousand of\r\nhis creatures bellowed his name and shook their hats aloft in mad\r\nexultation:\r\n\r\n“You’re our Saviour, you’ve cleaned the Temple of Liberty of its foul\r\nhorde of usurers. We salute you. We call you King-maker. Bryan shall\r\ncall you Master too. You shall have your reward. You shall stand behind\r\nthe throne. Your wisdom shall make us whole. You shall purge the land of\r\nthis unlawful crowd of money-lenders. You shall save the Republic. You\r\nare greater than Washington. You’re a better friend of ours than\r\nLincoln. You’ll do more for us than Grant. We’re your slaves. We salute\r\nyou. We thank you. We bless you. Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!”\r\n\r\nBut yet this vast throng of tamed monsters, this mighty mob of\r\nmomentarily good-natured haters of established order, broke away from\r\nthe master’s control for a few brief moments, and dipped their hands in\r\nthe enemy’s blood. The deed was swift as it was terrible. There were but\r\nfour of them, unarmed, on pleasure bent. At sight of these men, a\r\nthousand throats belched out a deep and awful growl of hatred. They were\r\nbrave men, and backed against the wall to die like brave men, stricken\r\ndown, beaten, torn, trampled, dragged, it was quick work. They had faced\r\nhowling savages in the far West, painted monsters in human form, but\r\nnever had they heard such yells leave the throats of men; and so they\r\ndied, four brave men, clad in the blue livery of the Republic, whose\r\nonly crime was that some months back, against the solemn protest of the\r\nMaster, their comrades had set foot on the soil of the commonwealth, and\r\nsaved the Metropolis of the West from the hands of this same mob.\r\n\r\nAnd so Chicago celebrated the election of the new President who was to\r\nfree the land from the grasp of the money-lenders, and undo the bad\r\nbusiness of years of unholy union between barterers and sellers of human\r\ntoil and the law makers of the land.\r\n\r\nThroughout the length and breadth of the South, and beyond the Great\r\nDivide, the news struck hamlet and village like the glad tidings of a\r\nnew evangel, almost as potent for human happiness as the heavenly\r\nmessage of two thousand years ago. Bells rang out in joyful acclaim, and\r\nthe very stars trembled at the telling, and the telling over and over of\r\nwhat had been done for the poor man by his brethren of the North, and\r\naround the blazing pine knots of the Southern cabin and in front of the\r\nmining camp fires of the Far West, the cry went up: “Silver is King!\r\nSilver is King!” Black palms and white were clasped in this strange\r\nlove-feast, and the dark skinned grand child no longer felt the sting of\r\nthe lash on his sire’s shoulder. All was peace and good will, for the\r\npeople were at last victorious over their enemies who had taxed and\r\ntithed them into a very living death. Now the laborer would not only be\r\nworthy of his hire, but it would be paid to him in a people’s dollar,\r\nfor the people’s good, and now the rich man’s coffers would be made to\r\nyield up their ill-gotten gain, and the sun would look upon this broad\r\nand fair land, and find no man without a market for the product of his\r\nlabors. Henceforth, the rich man should, as was right and proper, pay a\r\nroyal sum for the privilege of his happiness, and take the nation’s\r\ntaxes on his broad shoulders, where they belong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pens of many writers would not suffice to describe with anything\r\nlike historical fullness and precision, the wild scenes of excitement\r\nwhich, on the morning after election day, burst forth on the floors of\r\nthe various exchanges throughout the Union. The larger and more\r\nimportant the money centre, the deeper, blacker and heavier the despair\r\nwhich sank upon them after the violent ebullitions of protest, defiance\r\nand execration had subsided. With some, it seemed that visions of their\r\nswift but sure impoverishment only served to transform the dark and\r\ndismal drama of revolution and disintegration into a side-splitting\r\nfarce, and they greeted the prospective loss of their millions with loud\r\nguffaws and indescribable antics of horseplay and unseemly mirth.\r\n\r\nAs the day wore on, the news became worse and worse. It was only too\r\napparent that the House of Representatives of the Fifty-fifth Congress\r\nwould be controlled by the combined vote of the Populists and Free\r\nSilver men, while the wild joy with which the entire South welcomed the\r\nelection of Bryan and Sewall left little doubt in the minds of the\r\nNorthern people that the Southern Senators would, to a man, range\r\nthemselves on the Administration side of the great conflict into which\r\nthe Republic was soon to be precipitated. Add to these the twenty\r\nSenators of the Free Silver States of the North, and the new President\r\nwould have the Congress of the Republic at his back. There would be\r\nnothing to stand between him and the realization of those schemes which\r\nan exuberant fancy, untamed by the hand of experience, and scornful of\r\nthe leading-strings of wisdom, can conjure up.\r\n\r\nDid we say nothing? Nay, not so; for the Supreme Court was still there.\r\nAnd yet Justice Field had come fully up to the eightieth milestone in\r\nthe journey of life and Justice Gray was nearly seventy, while one or\r\ntwo other members of this High Court of Judicature held to their lives\r\nwith feeble grasp. Even in due and orderly course of events, why might\r\nthere not come vacancies and then?...\r\n\r\nIn spite of the nameless dread that rested upon so many of our people,\r\nand chilled the very blood of the country’s industries, the new year ’97\r\ncame hopefully, serenely, almost defiantly in. There was an\r\nindescribable something in the air, a spirit of political devil-me-care,\r\na feeling that the old order had passed away and that the Republic had\r\nentered into the womb of Time and been born again. This sentiment began\r\nto give outward and visible signs of its existence and growth in the\r\nremote agricultural districts of the South and Far West. They threw\r\naside their working implements, loitered about, gathered in groups and\r\nthe words Washington, White House, Silver, Bryan, Offices, Two for One,\r\nthe South’s Day, Reign of the Common People, Taxes, Incomes, Year of\r\nJubilee, Free Coinage, Wall Street, Altgeld, Tillman, Peffer, Coxey,\r\nwere whispered in a mysterious way with head noddings and pursing up of\r\nmouths.\r\n\r\nAs January wore away and February, slipping by, brought Bryan’s\r\nInauguration nearer and nearer, the groups melted into groups, and it\r\nwas only too apparent that from a dozen different points in the South\r\nand North West “Coxey Armies” were forming for an advance on Washington.\r\nIn some instances they were well clad and well provisioned; in others,\r\nthey were little better than great bands of hungry and restless men,\r\ndemoralized by idleness and wrought up to a strange degree of mental\r\nexcitement by the extravagant harangues of their leaders, who were\r\nanimated with but one thought, namely, to make use of these vast crowds\r\nof Silver Pilgrims, as they called themselves, to back up their claims\r\nfor public office.\r\n\r\nThese crowds of deluded people were well named “Silver Pilgrims,” for\r\nhundreds of them carried in hempen bags, pieces of silverware, in\r\nninety-nine cases of a hundred, plated stuff of little value, which\r\nunscrupulous dealers and peddlers had palmed off upon them as sterling,\r\nwith the promises that once in Washington, the United States Mint would\r\ncoin their metal into “Bryan Dollars” giving “two for one” in payment\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nWhile these motley “armies” marched upon the capitol of the Republic,\r\nthe railway trains night and day brought vast crowds of “new men,”\r\npoliticians of low degree, men out of employment, drunken and\r\ndisgruntled mechanics, farmer’s sons, to seek their fortunes under the\r\nReign of the People, heelers and hangers-on of ward bosses, old men who\r\nhad not tasted office for thirty years and more, all inspired by Mr.\r\nBryan’s declaration that “The American people are not in favor of life\r\ntenure in the Civil Service, that a permanent office holding class is\r\nnot in harmony with our institutions, that a fixed term in appointive\r\noffices would open the public service to a larger number of citizens,\r\nwithout impairing its efficiency,” all bearing new besoms in their hands\r\nor across their shoulders, each and every one of them supremely\r\nconfident that in the distribution of the spoils something would surely\r\nfall to his share, since they were the “Common People” who were so dear\r\nto Mr. Bryan, and who had made him President in the very face of the\r\nprodigious opposition of the rich men, whose coffers had been thrown\r\nwide open all to no purpose, and in spite too of the satanic and truly\r\ndevilish power of that hell upon earth known as Wall Street, which had\r\nsweated gold in vain in its desperate efforts to fasten the chains of\r\ntrusts and the claws of soulless monsters known as corporations upon\r\nthese very “Common People,” soon to march in triumph before the silver\r\nchariot of the young Conqueror from the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere had been a strange prophecy put forth by some one, and it had made\r\nits way into the daily journals, and had been laughingly or seriously\r\ncommented upon, according to the political tone of the paper, or the\r\npassing humor of the writer, that the 4th of March, 1897, would never\r\ndawn upon the American people. There was something very curious and\r\nuncanny about the prediction, and what actually happened was not\r\nqualified to loosen the fearful tension of public anxiety, for the day\r\nliterally and truly never dawned upon the City of Washington, and well\r\ndeserves its historical name, the “Dawnless Day.” At six o’clock, the\r\nhour of daybreak, such an impenetrable pall of clouds overhung the city\r\nthat there came no signs of day. The gathering crowds could plainly hear\r\nthe plaintive cries and lamentations put up in the negro quarters of the\r\ncity. Not until nearly nine o’clock did the light cease to “shine in\r\ndarkness” and the darkness begin to comprehend it.\r\n\r\nBut although it was a cheerless gray day, even at high noon, its\r\nheaviness set no weight upon the spirits of the jubilant tens of\r\nthousands which completely filled the city and its public parks, and ran\r\nover into camps and hastily improvised shelters outside the city limits.\r\n\r\nNot until the day previous had the President announced the names of\r\nthose selected for his Cabinet. The South and Far West were fairly\r\nbeside themselves with joy, for there had been from their standpoint\r\nugly rumors abroad for several days. It had even been hinted that Bryan\r\nhad surrendered to the “money-changers,” and that the selection of his\r\nconstitutional advisers would prove him recreant to the glorious cause\r\nof popular government, and that the Reign of the Common People would\r\nremain but a dream of the “struggling masses.”\r\n\r\nBut these apprehensions were short lived. The young President stood firm\r\nand fast on the platform of the parties which had raised him to his\r\nproud eminence. And what better proof of his thorough belief in himself\r\nand in his mission could he have given than the following:\r\n\r\nSecretary of State—William M. Stewart, of Nevada.\r\n\r\nSecretary of Treasury—Richard P. Bland, of Missouri.\r\n\r\nSecretary of War—John P. Altgeld, of Illinois.\r\n\r\nAttorney General—Roger Q. Mills, of Texas.\r\n\r\nPostmaster General—Henry George, of New York.\r\n\r\nSecretary Navy—John Gary Evans, of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nSecretary Interior—William A. Peffer, of Kansas.\r\n\r\nSecretary Agriculture—Lafe Pence, of Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that flashed across the minds of many upon glancing over\r\nthis list of names was the omission therefrom of Tillman’s. What did it\r\nmean? Could the young President have quarreled with his best friend, his\r\nmost powerful coadjutor? But the wiser ones only shook their heads and\r\nmade answer that it was Tillman’s hand that filled the blank for\r\nSecretary of the Navy, left there by the new ruler after the people’s\r\nown heart. Evans was but a creation of this great Commoner of the South,\r\nan image graven with his hands.\r\n\r\nThe inaugural address was not a disappointment to those who had come to\r\nhear it. It was like the man who delivered it—bold, outspoken,\r\nunmistakable in its terms, promising much, impatient of precedent,\r\nreckless of result; a double confirmation that this was to be the Reign\r\nof the Common People, that much should be unmade and much made over, and\r\nno matter how the rich man might cry out in anger or amazement, the\r\nnation must march on to the fulfillment of a higher and nobler mission\r\nthan the impoverishment and degradation of the millions for the\r\nenrichment and elevation of the few.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the young President—his large eyes filled with a strange\r\nlight, and his smooth, hairless visage radiant as a cloudless sky, his\r\nwife’s arm twined around his, and their hands linked in those of their\r\nchildren—passed within the lofty portal of the White House, than he\r\nthrew himself into a chair, and seizing a sheet of official paper penned\r\nthe following order, and directed its immediate promulgation:\r\n\r\n\r\n         EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., March 4th, 1897.\r\n\r\n Executive Order No. 1.\r\n\r\nIn order that there may be immediate relief in the terrible financial\r\ndepression now weighing upon our beloved country, consequent upon and\r\nresulting from the unlawful combination of capitalists and money-lenders\r\nboth in this Republic and in England, and that the ruinous and\r\ninevitable progress toward a universal gold standard may be stayed, the\r\nPresident orders and directs the immediate abandonment of the so-called\r\n“gold reserve,” and that on and after the promulgation of this order,\r\nthe gold and silver standard of the Constitution be resumed and strictly\r\nmaintained in all the business transactions of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was two o’clock in the afternoon when news of this now world-famous\r\nExecutive Order was flashed into the great banking centres of the\r\ncountry. Its effect in Wall street beggars description. On the floor of\r\nthe Stock Exchange men yelled and shrieked like painted savages, and, in\r\ntheir mad struggles, tore and trampled each other. Many dropped in\r\nfainting fits, or fell exhausted from their wild and senseless efforts\r\nto say what none would listen to. Ashen pallor crept over the faces of\r\nsome, while the blood threatened to burst the swollen arteries that\r\nspread in purple network over the brows of others. When silence came at\r\nlast, it was a silence broken by sobs and groans. Some wept, while\r\nothers stood dumb-stricken as if it was all a bad dream, and they were\r\nawaiting the return of their poor distraught senses to set them right\r\nagain. Ambulances were hastily summoned and fainting and exhausted forms\r\nwere borne through hushed and whispering masses wedged into Wall street,\r\nto be whirled away uptown to their residences, there to come into full\r\npossession of their senses only to cry out in their anguish that ruin,\r\nblack ruin, stared them in the face if this news from Washington should\r\nprove true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy proclamation bearing date the 5th day of March 1897, the President\r\nsummoned both houses of Congress to convene in extraordinary session\r\n“for the consideration of the general welfare of the United States, and\r\nto take such action as might seem necessary and expedient to them on\r\ncertain measures which he should recommend to their consideration,\r\nmeasures of vital import to the welfare and happiness of the people, if\r\nnot to the very existence of the Union and the continuance of their\r\nenjoyment of the liberties achieved by the fathers of the Republic.”\r\n\r\nWhile awaiting the day set for the coming together of the Congress, the\r\n“Great Friend of the Common People” came suddenly face to face with the\r\nfirst serious business of his Administration. Fifty thousand people\r\ntramped the streets of Washington without bread or shelter. Many had\r\ncome in quest of office, lured on by the solemn pronouncement of their\r\ncandidate that there should be at once a clean sweep of these barnacles\r\nof the ship of State and so complete had been their confidence in their\r\nglorious young captain, that they had literally failed to provide\r\nthemselves with either “purse or script or shoes,” and now stood hungry\r\nand footsore at his gate, begging for a crust of bread. But most of\r\nthose making up this vast multitude were “the unarmed warriors of\r\npeaceful armies” like the one once led by the redoubtable Coxey, decoyed\r\nfrom farm and hamlet and plantation by some nameless longing to “go\r\nforth” to stand in the presence of this new Savior of Society, whose\r\nadvent to power was to bring them “double pay” for all their toil. While\r\non the march all had gone well, for their brethren had opened their\r\nhearts and their houses as these “unarmed warriors” had marched with\r\nflying banners and loud huzzas through the various towns on the route.\r\n\r\nBut now the holiday was over, they were far from their homes, they were\r\nin danger of perishing from hunger. What was to be done? “They are our\r\npeople,” said the President, “their love of country has undone them; the\r\nnation must not let them suffer, for they are its hope and its shield in\r\nthe hour of war, and its glory and its refuge in times of peace. They\r\nare the common people for whose benefit this Republic was established.\r\nThe Kings of the earth may desert them; I never shall.” The Secretary of\r\nWar was directed to establish camps in the parks and suburbs of the city\r\nand to issue rations and blankets to these luckless wanderers until the\r\nGovernment could provide for their transportation back to their homes.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, March 15th, the President received the usual notification\r\nfrom both houses of Congress, that they had organized and were ready for\r\nthe consideration of such measures as he might choose to recommend for\r\ntheir action.\r\n\r\nThe first act to pass both houses and receive the signature of the\r\nPresident, was an Act repealing the Act of 1873, and opening the mints\r\nof the United States to the free coinage of silver at the ratio of\r\nsixteen to one, with gold, and establishing branch mints in the cities\r\nof Denver, Omaha, Chicago, Kansas City, Spokane, Los Angeles, Charleston\r\nand Mobile.\r\n\r\nThe announcement that reparation had thus been made to the people for\r\nthe “Crime of 1873” was received with loud cheering on the floors and in\r\nthe galleries of both houses.\r\n\r\nAnd the Great North heard these cheers and trembled.\r\n\r\nThe next measure of great public import brought before the House was an\r\nact to provide additional revenue by levying a tax upon the incomes,\r\nsubstantially on the lines laid down by the legislation of 1894. The\r\nRepublican Senators strove to make some show of resistance to this\r\nmeasure, but so solid were the administration ranks, that they only\r\nsucceeded in delaying it for a few weeks. This first skirmish with the\r\nenemy, however, brought the President and his followers to a realizing\r\nsense that not only must the Senate be shorn of its power to block the\r\n“new movement of regeneration and reform” by the adoption of rules\r\ncutting off prolonged debate, but that the “new dispensation” must at\r\nonce proceed to increase its senatorial representation, for who could\r\ntell what moment some one of the Northern Silver States might not slip\r\naway from its allegiance to the “Friend of the Common People.”\r\n\r\nThe introduction of a bill repealing the various Civil Service acts\r\npassed for the alleged purpose of “regulating and improving the Civil\r\nService of the United States,” and of another repealing the various acts\r\nestablishing National Banks, and substituting United States notes for\r\nall national bank notes based upon interest bearing bonds, opened the\r\neyes of the Republican opposition to the fact that the President and his\r\nparty were possessed of the courage of their convictions, and were\r\ndetermined, come good report or evil report, to wipe all conflicting\r\nlegislation from the statute books. The battle in the Senate now took on\r\na spirit of extreme acrimony; scenes not witnessed since the days of\r\nSlavery, were of daily occurrence on the floors of both the House and\r\nthe Senate. Threats of secession came openly from the North only to be\r\nmet with the jeers and laughter of the silver and populist members.\r\n“We’re in the saddle at last,” exclaimed a Southern member, “and we\r\nintend to ride on to victory!”\r\n\r\nThe introduction of bills for the admission of New Mexico and Arizona,\r\nand for the division of Texas into two States to be called East Texas\r\nand West Texas, although each of these measures was strictly within the\r\nletter of the Constitution, fell among the members of the Republican\r\nopposition like a torch in a house of tinder. There was fire at once,\r\nand the blaze of party spirit leapt to such dangerous heights that the\r\nwhole nation looked on in consternation. Was the Union about to go up in\r\na great conflagration and leave behind it but the ashes and charred\r\npedestals of its greatness?\r\n\r\n“We are the people” wrote the President in lines of dignity and\r\ncalmness. “We are the people and what we do, we do under the holy\r\nsanction of law, and there is no one so powerful or so bold as to dare\r\nto say we do not do well in lifting off the nation’s shoulders the\r\ngrievous and unlawful burdens which preceding Congresses have placed\r\nupon them.”\r\n\r\nAnd so the “Long Session” of the fifty-fifth Congress was entered upon,\r\nfated to last through summer heat and autumn chill, and until winter\r\ncame again and the Constitution itself set limits to its lasting. And\r\nwhen that day came, and its speaker, amid a wild tumult of cheers, arose\r\nto declare it ended not by their will, but by the law of the land, he\r\nsaid: “The glorious revolution is in its brightest bud. Since the\r\nPresident called upon us to convene in last March, we have with the\r\nstrong blade of public indignation, and with a full sense of our\r\nresponsibility, erased from the statute books the marks of our country’s\r\nshame and our people’s subjugation. Liberty can not die. There remains\r\nmuch to be done in the way of building up. Let us take heart and push\r\non. On Monday, the regular session of this Congress will begin. We must\r\ngreet our loved ones from the distance. We have no time to go home and\r\nembrace them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a Republican member of the House arose to move the usual\r\nadjournment for the holidays, there was a storm of hisses and cries of\r\n“No, no!”\r\n\r\nSaid the leader of the House, amid deafening plaudits: “We are the\r\nservants of the people. Our work is not yet complete. There must be no\r\nplay for us while coal barons stand with their feet on the ashes of the\r\npoor man’s hearthstone, and weeds and thorns cumber the fields of the\r\nfarmer for lack of money to buy seed and implements. There must be no\r\nplay for us while railway magnates press from the pockets of the\r\nlaboring man six and eight per cent. return on thrice watered stocks,\r\nand rapacious landlords, enriched by inheritance, grind the faces of the\r\npoor. There must be no play for us while enemies of the human kind are,\r\nby means of trust and combination and ‘corners,’ engaged in drawing\r\ntheir unholy millions from the very life-blood of the nation, paralyzing\r\nits best efforts and setting the blight of intemperance and indifference\r\nupon it, by making life but one long struggle for existence, without a\r\ngleam of rest and comfort in old age. No, Mr. Speaker, we must not\r\nadjourn, but by our efforts in these halls of legislation let the nation\r\nknow that we are at work for its emancipation, and by these means let\r\nthe monopolists and money-changers be brought to a realizing sense that\r\nthe Reign of the Common People has really been entered upon, and then\r\nthe bells will ring out a happier, gladder New Year than has ever dawned\r\nupon this Republic.”\r\n\r\nThe opposition fairly quailed before the vigor and earnestness of the\r\n“new dispensation.” There were soon before the House and pressed well on\r\ntoward final passage a number of important measures calculated to awaken\r\nan intense feeling of enthusiasm among the working classes. Among these\r\nwas an Act establishing a Loan Commission for the loaning of certain\r\nmoneys of the United States to Farmers and Planters without interest; an\r\nAct for the establishment of a permanent Department of Public Works, its\r\nhead to be styled Secretary of Public Works, rank as a cabinet officer,\r\nand supervise the expenditure of all public moneys for the construction\r\nof public buildings and the improvement of rivers and harbors; an Act\r\nmaking it a felony, punishable with imprisonment for life, for any\r\ncitizen or combination of citizens to enter into any trust or agreement\r\nto stifle, suppress or in any way interfere with full, open and fair\r\ncompetition in trade and manufacture among the States, or to make use of\r\nany inter-State railroads, waterways or canals for the transportation of\r\nany food products or goods, wares or merchandise which may have been\r\n“cornered,” stored or withheld with a view to enhance the value thereof;\r\nand, most important of all, a preliminary Act having for its object the\r\nappointment of Commissioners for the purchase by the Federal Government\r\nof all inter-State railway and telegraph lines, and in the meantime the\r\nstrict regulation of all fares and charges by a Government Commission,\r\nfrom whose established schedules there shall be no appeal.\r\n\r\nOn Washington’s Birthday the President issued an Address of\r\nCongratulation to the People of the United States, from which the\r\nfollowing is extracted:\r\n\r\n“The malicious prognostications of our political opponents have proven\r\nthemselves to be but empty sound and fury. Although not quite one year\r\nhas elapsed since I, agreeable to your mandate, restored to you the\r\nmoney of the Constitution, yet from every section of our Union comes the\r\nglad tidings of renewed activity and prosperity. The workingman no\r\nlonger sits cold and hungry beside a cheerless hearthstone; the farmer\r\nhas taken heart and resumed work; the wheels of the factory are in\r\nmotion again; the shops and stores of the legitimate dealer and trader\r\nare full of bustle and action. There is content everywhere, save in the\r\ncounting-room of the money-changer, for which thank God and the common\r\npeople of this Republic. The free coinage of that metal which the\r\nCreator, in His wisdom, stored with so lavish a hand in the subterranean\r\nvaults of our glorious mountain ranges, has proven a rich and manifold\r\nblessing for our people. It is in every sense of the word the ‘people’s\r\nmoney,’ and already the envious world looks on in amazement that we have\r\nshown our ability to do without ‘foreign cooperation.’ The Congress of\r\nour Republic has been in almost continuous session since I took my oath\r\nof office, and the administration members deserve your deepest and most\r\nheartfelt gratitude. They are rearing for themselves a monument more\r\nlasting than chiseled bronze or polished monolith. They knew no rest,\r\nthey asked for no respite from their labors until, at my earnest\r\nrequest, they adjourned over to join their fellow citizens in the\r\nobservance of this sacred anniversary.\r\n\r\n“Fellow citizens, remember the bonds which a wicked and selfish class of\r\nusurers and speculators fastened upon you, and on this anniversary of\r\nthe birth of the Father of our Country, let us renew our pledges to undo\r\ncompletely and absolutely their infamous work, and in public assembly\r\nand family circle, let us by new vows confirm our love of right and\r\njustice, so that the great gain may not slip away from us, but go on\r\nincreasing so long as the statute books contain a single trace of the\r\nrecord of our enslavement. As for me, I have but one ambition, and that\r\nis to deserve so well of you that when you come to write my epitaph, you\r\nset beneath my name the single line:\r\n\r\n               “Here lies a Friend of the Common People.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis first year of the Silver Administration was scarcely rounded up,\r\nere there began to be ugly rumors that the Government was no longer able\r\nto hold the white metal at a parity with gold. “It is the work of Wall\r\nStreet,” cried the friends of the President, but wiser heads were shaken\r\nin contradiction, for they had watched the sowing of the wind of\r\nunreason, and knew only too well that the whirlwind of folly must be\r\nreaped in due season.\r\n\r\nThe country had been literally submerged by a silver flood which had\r\npoured its argent waves into every nook and cranny of the Republic,\r\nstimulating human endeavor to most unnatural and harmful vigor. Mad\r\nspeculation stalked over the land. People sold what they should have\r\nclung to, and bought what they did not need. Manufacturers heaped up\r\ngoods for which there was no demand, and farmers ploughed where they had\r\nnot drained and drained, where they were never fated to plough. The\r\nsmall dealer enlarged his business with more haste than judgment, and\r\nthe widow drew her mite from the bank of savings to buy land on which\r\nshe was destined never to set foot. The spirit of greed and gain lodged\r\nin every mind, and the “Common People” with a mad eagerness loosened the\r\nstrings of their leather purses to cast their hard-earned savings into\r\nwild schemes of profit. Every scrap and bit of the white metal that they\r\ncould lay their hands upon, spoons hallowed by the touch of lips long\r\nsince closed in death, and cups and tankards from which grand sires had\r\ndrunken were bundled away to the mints to be coined into “people’s\r\ndollars.”\r\n\r\nAt the very first rumor of the slipping away of this trusted coin from\r\nits parity with gold, there was a fearful awakening, like the start and\r\nthe gasp of the miser who sees his horded treasure melting away from\r\nbefore his eyes, and he not able to reach out and stay its going.\r\n\r\nProtest and expostulation first, then came groans and prayers, from\r\nwhich there was an easy road to curses. The working man threw off his\r\ncap and apron to rush upon the public square, and demand his rights.\r\nMobs ran together, processions formed, deputations hurried off to\r\nWashington, not on foot like the Coxey Army, but on the swift wings of\r\nthe Limited Express.\r\n\r\nThe “common people” were admitted to the bar of the house, their plaints\r\npatiently listened to, and reparation promised. Bills for increased\r\nrevenue were hurriedly introduced, and new taxes were loaded upon the\r\nbroad shoulders of the millionaires of the nation;—taxes on checks,\r\ntaxes on certificates of incorporation, taxes on deeds and mortgages,\r\ntaxes on pleasure yachts, taxes on private parks and plaisances, taxes\r\non wills of all property above $5,000 in value, taxes on all gifts of\r\nrealty for and in consideration of natural love and affection, taxes on\r\nall passage tickets to foreign lands, and double taxes on the estates of\r\nall absentees on and after the lapse of six months.\r\n\r\nThere was a doubling up too of the tariff on all important luxuries, for\r\nas was said on the floor of Congress, “if the silks and satins of\r\nAmerican looms and the wines and tobacco of native growth, are not good\r\nenough for ‘my Lord of Wall Street,’ let him pay the difference and\r\nthank heaven that he can get them at that price.”\r\n\r\nTo quiet the murmurs of the good people of the land, additional millions\r\nwere placed to the credit of the Department of Public Works, and harbors\r\nwere dredged out in one month only to fill up in the next, and new\r\nsystems of improvement of interstate waterways were entered upon on a\r\nscale of magnitude hitherto undreamt of. The Commissioners for the\r\ndistribution of public moneys to farmers so impoverished as to be unable\r\nto work their lands, were kept busy in placing “Peffer Loans” where the\r\nneed of them seemed to be the greatest, and to put a stop to the\r\n“nefarious doings of money-changers and traders in the misfortunes of\r\nthe people,” a statute was enacted making it a felony punishable with\r\nimprisonment for life, for any person or corporate body to buy and sell\r\ngovernment bonds or public funds, or deal in them with a view to draw\r\ngain or profit from their rise and fall in value.\r\n\r\nBut try never so hard, the Government found itself powerless to check\r\nthe slow but steady decline in value of the people’s dollar. By\r\nmidsummer, it had fallen to forty-three cents, and ere the fair\r\nNorthland had wrapped itself, like a scornful beauty, in its Autumn\r\nmantle of gold, the fondly trusted coin had sunk to exactly one-third of\r\nthe value of a standard gold dollar. People carried baskets in their\r\narms, filled with the now discredited coin, when they went abroad to pay\r\na debt or make purchase of the necessaries of life. Huge sacks of the\r\nwhite metal were flung at the door of the mortgagee when discharge was\r\nsought for a few thousand dollars. Men servants accompanied their\r\nmistresses upon shopping tours to carry the necessary funds, and leather\r\npockets took the place of the old time muslin ones in male habiliments,\r\nleast the weight of the fifteen coins required to make up a five dollar\r\ngold piece should tear the thin stuff and spill a dollar at every step.\r\n\r\nAll day long in the large cities, huge trucks loaded with sacks of the\r\ncoin rolled and rumbled over the pavement in the adjustment of the\r\nbusiness balances of the day. The tradesman who called for his bill was\r\nmet at the door with a coal scuttle or a nail keg filled with the\r\nneedful amount, and on pay day, the working man took his eldest boy with\r\nhim to “tote the stuff home” while he carried the usual bundle of\r\nfirewood. And strange to say, this dollar, once so beloved by the\r\n“common people,” parted with its very nature of riches and lay in heaps\r\nunnoticed and unheeded on shelf or table, until occasion arose to pay it\r\nout which was done with a careless and contemptuous toss as if it were\r\nthe iron money of the ancient Spartans, and Holy Writ for once at least,\r\nwas disproven and discredited for the thief showed not the slightest\r\ninclination to “break in and steal” where these treasures had been laid\r\nup on earth, although the discs of white metal might lie in full view on\r\nthe table, like so many pewter platters or pieces of tinware. Men let\r\ndebts run, rather than call for them, and barter and exchange came into\r\nvogue again, the good housewife calling on her neighbor for a loan of\r\nflour or meal, promising to return the same in sugar or dried fruit\r\nwhenever the need might arise.\r\n\r\nAnd still the once magic discs of silver slipped slowly and silently\r\ndownward, and ever downward in value and good name, until it almost\r\nseemed as if the people hated the very name of silver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Fateful year of ’99” upon its coming in, found the Republic of\r\nWashington in dire and dangerous straits. The commercial and industrial\r\nboom had spent its force, and now the frightful evils of a debased\r\ncurrency, coupled with demoralizing effects of rampant paternalism, were\r\ngradually strangling the land to death. Capital, ever timid and\r\ndistrustful in such times, hid itself in safe deposit vaults, or fled to\r\nEurope. Labor, although really hard pressed and lacking the very\r\nnecessities of life, was loudmouthed and defiant. Socialism and\r\nAnarchism found willing ears into which to pour their burning words of\r\nhatred and malevolence, and the consequence was that serious rioting\r\nbroke out in the larger cities of the North, often taxing the capacities\r\nof the local authorities to the utmost.\r\n\r\nIt was bruited abroad that violent dissensions had arisen in the\r\nCabinet, the young President giving signs of a marked change of mind,\r\nand like many a man who has appealed to the darker passions of the human\r\nheart, he seemed almost ready to exclaim: “I stand alone. The spirits I\r\nhave called up are no longer obedient to me. My country, oh, my country,\r\nhow willingly would I give my life for thee, if by such a sacrifice I\r\ncould restore thee to thy old time prosperity.”\r\n\r\nFor the first he began to realize what an intense spirit of sectionalism\r\nhad entered into this “revolutionary propaganda.” He spoke of his fears\r\nto none save to his wise and prudent helpmate.\r\n\r\n“I trust you, beloved,” she whispered, as she pressed the broad, strong\r\nhands that held her enclasped.\r\n\r\n“Ay, dear one, but does my country?” came in almost a groan from the\r\nlips of the youthful ruler.\r\n\r\nMost evident was it, that thus far the South had been the great gainer\r\nin this struggle for power. She had increased her strength in the Senate\r\nby six votes; she had regained her old time prestige in the House; one\r\nof her most trusted sons was in the Speaker’s chair, while another\r\nbrilliant Southron led the administration forces on the floor. Born as\r\nshe was for the brilliant exercise of intellectual vigor, the South was\r\nof that strain of blood which knows how to wear the kingly graces of\r\npower so as best to impress the “common people.” Many of the men of the\r\nNorth had been charmed and fascinated by this natural pomp and inborn\r\ndemeanor of greatness and had yielded to it.\r\n\r\nNot a month had gone by that this now dominant section had not made some\r\nnew demand upon the country at large. Early in the session, at its\r\nrequest, the internal revenue tax which had rested so long upon the\r\ntobacco crop of the South, and poured so many millions of revenue into\r\nthe national treasury, was wiped from the statute books with but a\r\nfeeble protest from the North.\r\n\r\nBut now the country was thrown into a state bordering upon frenzy by a\r\nnew demand, which, although couched in calm and decorous terms, nay,\r\nalmost in the guise of a petition for long-delayed justice to\r\nhard-pressed and suffering brethren, had about it a suppressed, yet\r\nunmistakable tone of conscious power and imperiousness which well became\r\nthe leader who spoke for “that glorious Southland to which this Union\r\nowes so much of its greatness and its prestige.”\r\n\r\nSaid he: “Mr. Speaker, for nearly thirty years our people, although left\r\nimpoverished by the conflict of the states, have given of their\r\nsubstance to salve the wounds and make green the old age of the men who\r\nconquered us. We have paid this heavy tax, this fearful blood money\r\nunmurmuringly. You have forgiven us for our bold strike for liberty that\r\nGod willed should not succeed. You have given us back our rights, opened\r\nthe doors of these sacred halls to us, called us your brothers, but\r\nunlike noble Germany who was content to exact a lump sum from “la belle\r\nFrance,” and then bid her go in peace and freedom from all further\r\nexactions, you have for nearly thirty years laid this humiliating war\r\ntax upon us, and thus forced us year in and year out to kiss the very\r\nhand that smote us. Are we human that we now cry out against it? Are we\r\nmen that we feel no tingle in our veins after these long years of\r\npunishment for no greater crime than that we loved liberty better than\r\nthe bonds of a confederation laid upon us by our fathers? We appeal to\r\nyou as our brothers and our countrymen. Lift this infamous tax from our\r\nland, than which your great North is ten thousand times richer. Do one\r\nof two things: Either take our aged and decrepit soldiers by the hand\r\nand bless their last days with pensions from the treasury of our common\r\ncountry, for they were only wrong in that their cause failed, or remove\r\nthis hated tax and make such restitution of this blood money as shall\r\nseem just and equitable to your soberer and better judgment.”\r\n\r\nTo say that this speech, of which the foregoing is but a brief extract,\r\nthrew both Houses of Congress into most violent disorder, but faintly\r\ndescribes its effect. Cries of treason! treason! went up; blows were\r\nexchanged and hand to hand struggles took place in the galleries,\r\nfollowed by the flash of the dread bowie and the crack of the ready\r\npistol. The Republic was shaken to its very foundations. Throughout the\r\nNorth there was but a repetition of the scenes that followed the firing\r\nupon Sumter. Public meetings were held, and resolutions passed calling\r\nupon the Government to concentrate troops in and about Washington, and\r\nprepare for the suppression of a second Rebellion.\r\n\r\nBut gradually this outbreak of popular indignation lost some of its\r\nstrength and virulence, for it was easy to comprehend that nothing would\r\nbe gained at this stage of the matter by meeting a violent and unlawful\r\ndemand with violence and unwise counsels. Besides, what was it any way\r\nbut the idle threat of a certain clique of unscrupulous politicians?\r\n\r\nThe Republic stood upon too firm a foundation to be shaken by mere\r\nappeals to the passions of the hour. To commit treason against our\r\ncountry called for an overt act. What had it to dread from the mere\r\noratorical flash of a passing storm of feeling?\r\n\r\nIt is hard to say what the young President thought of these scenes in\r\nCongress. So pale had he grown of late that a little more of pallor\r\nwould pass unnoted, but those who were wont to look upon his face in\r\nthese troublous times report that in the short space of a few days the\r\nlines in his countenance deepened perceptibly, and that a firmer and\r\nstronger expression of will-power lurked in the corners of his wide\r\nmouth, overhung his square and massive chin, and accentuated the\r\nvibrations of his wide-opened nostrils. He was under a terrible strain.\r\nWhen he had caught up the sceptre of power, it seemed a mere bauble in\r\nhis strong grasp, but now it had grown strangely heavy, and there was a\r\nmysterious pricking at his brow, as if that crown of thorns which he had\r\nnot willed should be set upon the heads of others, were being pressed\r\ndown with cruel hands upon his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the last embers of the great conflagration of the Rebellion had\r\nbeen smothered out with tears for the Lost Cause, a prophecy had gone up\r\nthat the mighty North, rich with a hundred great cities, and strong in\r\nthe conscious power of its wide empire, would be the next to raise the\r\nstandard of rebellion against the Federal Government. But that prophet\r\nwas without honor in his own land, and none had paid heed to his\r\nseemingly wild words.\r\n\r\nYet now, this same mighty North sat there in her grief and anxiety, with\r\nher face turned Southward, and her ear strained to catch the whispers\r\nthat were in the air. Had not the sceptre of power passed from her hand\r\nforever? Was not the Revolution complete? Were not the Populists and\r\ntheir allies firmly seated in the Halls of Congress? Had not the Supreme\r\nCourt been rendered powerless for good by packing it with the most\r\nuncompromising adherents of the new political faith? Had not the very\r\nnature of the Federal Government undergone a change: Was not Paternalism\r\nrampant? Was not Socialism on the increase? Were there not everywhere\r\nevidences of an intense hatred of the North and a firm determination to\r\nthrow the whole burden of taxation upon the shoulders of the rich man,\r\nin order that the surplus revenues of the Government might be\r\ndistributed among those who constitute the “common people?” How could\r\nthis section of the Union ever hope to make head against the South,\r\nunited, as it now was, with the rapidly growing States of the Northwest?\r\nCould the magnificent cities of the North content themselves to march at\r\nthe tail of Tillman’s and Peffer’s chariots? Had not the South a firm\r\nhold of the Senate? Where was there a ray of hope that the North could\r\never again regain its lost power, and could it for a single moment think\r\nof entrusting its vast interests to the hands of a people differing with\r\nthem on every important question of statecraft, pledged to a policy that\r\ncould not be otherwise than ruinous to the welfare of the grand\r\ncommonwealths of the Middle and Eastern sections of the Union and their\r\nsister States this side of the Mississippi? It were madness to think of\r\nit. The plunge must be taken, the declaration must be made. There was no\r\nother alternative, save abject submission to the chieftains of the new\r\ndispensation, and the complete transformation of that vast social and\r\npolitical system vaguely called the North.\r\n\r\nBut this revolution within a revolution would be a bloodless one, for\r\nthere could be no thought of coercion, no serious notion of checking\r\nsuch a mighty movement. It would be in reality the true Republic purging\r\nitself of a dangerous malady, sloughing off a diseased and gangrened\r\nmember; no more, no less.\r\n\r\nAlready this mighty movement of withdrawals from the Witenagemote of the\r\nUnion was in the air. People spoke of it in a whisper, or with bated\r\nbreath; but as they turned it over and over in their minds, it took on\r\nshape and form and force, till at last it burst into life and action\r\nlike Minerva from Jupiter’s brain—full-fledged, full-armed, full-voiced\r\nand full-hearted.\r\n\r\nReally, why would it not be all for the best that this mighty empire,\r\nrapidly growing so vast and unwieldy as to be only with the greatest\r\ndifficulty governable from a single centre, should be split into three\r\nparts, Eastern, Southern and Western, now that it may be done without\r\ndangerous jar or friction? The three republics could be federated for\r\npurposes offensive and defensive, and until these great and radical\r\nchanges could be brought about there would be no great difficulty in\r\ndevising “living terms,” for immediately upon the Declaration of\r\nDissolution, each State would become repossessed of the sovereign powers\r\nwhich it had delegated to the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the “Fateful year ’99” went onward toward its close. The whole\r\nland seemed stricken with paralysis, so far as the various industries\r\nwere concerned, but, as it is wont to be in such times, men’s minds were\r\nsupernaturally active. The days were passed in the reading of public\r\nprints, or in passing in review the weighty events of the hour. The\r\nNorth was only waiting for an opportunity to act.\r\n\r\nBut the question that perplexed the wisest heads was: How and when shall\r\nthe Declaration of Dissolution be made, and how soon thereafter shall\r\nthe North and the States in sympathy with her withdraw from the Union,\r\nand declare to the world their intention to set up a republic of their\r\nown, with the mighty metropolis of New York as its social, political and\r\ncommercial centre and capital?\r\n\r\nAs it came to pass, the North had not long to wait. The Fifty-sixth\r\nCongress soon to convene in regular session in the city of Washington,\r\nwas even more Populistic and Socialistic than its famous predecessor,\r\nwhich had wrought such wonderful changes in the law of the land, showing\r\nno respect for precedent, no reverence for the old order of things.\r\nHence all eyes were fixed upon the capital of the nation, all roads were\r\nuntrodden, save those which led to Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain Congress had refused to adjourn over for the holidays. The leaders\r\nof the Administration forces were unwilling to close their eyes, even\r\nfor needful sleep, and went about pale and haggard, startled at every\r\nword and gesture of the opposition, like true conspirators, as they\r\nwere, for the Federal troops had been almost to a man quietly removed\r\nfrom the Capital and its vicinage, lest the President in a moment of\r\nweakness, might do or suffer to be done some act unfriendly to the Reign\r\nof the Common People.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, there had been very little note taken by the\r\ncountry at large of the introduction at the opening of the session of an\r\nAct to extend the Pension System of the United States to the Soldiers of\r\nthe Confederate Armies, and for covering back into the various\r\ntreasuries of certain States of the Union, such portions of internal\r\nrevenue taxes collected since the readmission of said states to the\r\nFederal Congress, as may be determined by Commissioners duly appointed\r\nunder said Act.\r\n\r\nWas it the calm of despair, the stolidity of desperation, or the cool\r\nand restrained energy of a noble and refined courage?\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the Act, however, had one effect; it set in motion\r\ntoward the National capital, mighty streams of humanity—not of wild-eyed\r\nfanatics or unshaven and unkempt politicasters and bezonians—but of\r\nsoberly-clad citizens with a business-like air about them, evidently men\r\nwho knew how to earn more than enough for a living, men who paid their\r\ntaxes and had a right to take a look at the public servants, if desire\r\nso moved them. But very plain was it that the mightier stream flowed in\r\nfrom the South, and those who remembered the Capital in antebellum days,\r\nsmiled at the old familiar sight, the clean-shaven faces, the long hair\r\nthrown carelessly back under the broad brim felts, the half unbuttoned\r\nwaistcoats and turn down collars, the small feet and neatly fitting\r\nboots, the springy loping pace, the soft negroese intonation, the long\r\nfragrant cheroot.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to pick out the man from the Northland, well clad and\r\nwell-groomed, as careful of his linen as a woman, prim and trim,\r\ndisdainful of the picturesque felts, ever crowned with the ceremonious\r\nderby, the man of affairs, taking a business-like view of life, but\r\nwearing for the nonce a worried look and drawing ever and anon a deep\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nThe black man, ever at the heels of his white brother, set to rule over\r\nhim by an inscrutable decree of nature, came forth too in thousands,\r\nchatting and laughing gayly, careless of the why or wherefore of his\r\nwhite brother’s deep concern, and powerless to comprehend it had he so\r\ndesired. Every hour now added to the throng. The broad avenues were none\r\ntoo broad. The excitement increased. Men talked louder and louder, women\r\nand children disappeared almost completely from the streets. The\r\n“Southern element” drew more and more apart in knots and groups by\r\nitself. Men threw themselves upon their beds to catch a few hours sleep,\r\nbut without undressing, as if they were expecting the happening of some\r\nportentous event at any moment, the event of their lives, and dreaded\r\nthe thought of being a moment late.\r\n\r\nIf all went well, the bill would come up for final passage on Saturday,\r\nthe 30th day of the month, but so fierce was the battle raged against\r\nit, and so frequent the interruptions by the contumacy both of members\r\nand of the various cliques crowding the galleries to suffocation, that\r\nlittle or no progress could be made.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the administration forces saw midnight drawing near with\r\nno prospect of attaining their object before the coming in of Sunday on\r\nwhich the House had never been known to sit. An adjournment over to\r\nMonday of the New Year might be fatal, for who could tell what\r\nunforeseen force might not break up their solid ranks and throw them\r\ninto confusion. They must rise equal to the occasion. A motion was made\r\nto suspend the rules, and to remain in continuous session until the\r\nbusiness before the House was completed. Cries of “Unprecedented!”\r\n“Revolutionary!” “Monstrous!” came from the opposition, but all to no\r\npurpose; the House settled down to its work with such a grim\r\ndetermination to conquer that the Republican minority fairly quailed\r\nbefore it. Food and drink were brought to the members in their seats;\r\nthey ate, drank and slept at their posts, like soldiers determined not\r\nto be ambushed or stampeded.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange sight, and yet an impressive one withal—a great party\r\nstruggling for long deferred rights—freemen jealous of their liberties,\r\nbound together with the steel hooks of determination that only death\r\nmight break asunder.\r\n\r\nSunday came in at last, and still the struggle went on. “The people know\r\nno days when their liberties are at stake,” cried the leader of the\r\nHouse. “The Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath.”\r\n\r\nMany of the speeches delivered on that famous Sunday sounded more like\r\nthe lamentations of a Jeremiah, the earnest and burning utterances of a\r\nPaul, or the scholarly and well-rounded periods of an Apollos. The weary\r\nhours were lightened by the singing of hymns by the Southern members,\r\nmost of them good methodists, in which their friends and sympathizers in\r\nthe galleries joined full throated and fuller hearted; while at times,\r\nclear, resonant and in perfect unison, the voices of the staunch men of\r\nthe North broke in and drowned out the religious song with the majestic\r\nand soul-stirring measures of “John Brown’s Body,” the “Glory, Glory\r\nHalleluiah” of which seemed to hush the tumult of the Chamber like a\r\nweird chant of some invisible chorus breaking in upon the fierce rioting\r\nof a Belshazzar’s feast.\r\n\r\nSomewhat after eleven o’clock, an ominous silence sank upon the opposing\r\ncamps, the Republican leaders could be seen conferring together\r\nnervously. It was a sacred hour of night, thrice sacred for the great\r\nRepublic. Not only a New Year, but a New Century was about to break upon\r\nthe world. A strange hush crept over the turbulent House, and its still\r\nmore turbulent galleries.\r\n\r\nThe Republican leader rose to his feet. His voice sounded cold and\r\nhollow. Strong men shivered as they listened. “Mr. Speaker: We have done\r\nour duty to our country; we have nothing more to say, no more blows to\r\nstrike. We cannot stand here within the sacred precincts of this\r\nChamber, and see our rights as freemen trampled beneath the feet of the\r\nmajority. We have striven to prevent the downfall of the Republic, like\r\nmen sworn to battle against wrong and tyranny, but there comes a time\r\nwhen blank despair seizes upon the hearts of those who struggle against\r\noverwhelming odds. That hour has sounded for us. We believe our people,\r\nthe great and generous people of the North, will cry unto us: Well done,\r\ngood and faithful servants. If we do wrong, let them condemn us. We,\r\nevery man of us, Mr. Speaker, have but this moment sworn not to stand\r\nwithin this Chamber and witness the passage of this act. Therefore we\r\ngo——”\r\n\r\n“Not so, my countrymen,” cried a clear metallic far-reaching voice that\r\nsounded through the Chamber with an almost supernatural ring in it. In\r\nan instant, every head was turned and a thousand voices burst out with\r\nsuppressed force:\r\n\r\n“The President! The President!”\r\n\r\nIn truth, it was he, standing at the bar of the House, wearing the\r\nvisage of death rather than of life. The next instant the House and\r\ngalleries burst into a deafening clamor which rolled up and back in\r\nmighty waves that shook the very walls. There was no stilling it. Again\r\nand again it burst forth, the mingling of ten thousand words, howling,\r\nrumbling and groaning like the warring elements of nature. Several times\r\nthe President stretched forth his great white hands appealing for\r\nsilence, while the dew of mingled dread and anguish beaded on his brow\r\nand trickled down his cheeks in liquid supplication that his people\r\nmight either slay him or listen to him. The tumult stilled its fury for\r\na moment, and he could be heard saying brokenly:\r\n\r\n“My countrymen, oh, my countrymen——”\r\n\r\nBut the quick sharp sound of the gavel cut him short.\r\n\r\n“The President must withdraw,” said the Speaker, calmly and coldly, “his\r\npresence here is a menace to our free deliberation.”\r\n\r\nAgain the tumult set up its deafening roar, while a look of almost\r\nhorror overspread the countenance of the Chief Magistrate.\r\n\r\nOnce more his great white hands went heavenward, pleading for silence\r\nwith such a mute majesty of supplication, that silence fell upon the\r\nimmense assemblage, and his lips moved not in vain.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen of the House of Representatives, I stand here upon my just\r\nand lawful right as President of the Republic, to give you ‘information\r\nof the state of the Union.’ I have summoned the Honorable the Senate, to\r\nmeet me in this Chamber. I call upon you to calm your passions, and give\r\near to me as your oath of office sets the sacred obligation upon you.”\r\n\r\nThere was a tone of godlike authority in these few words, almost divine\r\nenough to make the winds obey and still the tempestuous sea. In deepest\r\nsilence, and with a certain show of rude and native grandeur of bearing,\r\nthe Senators made their entrance into the Chamber, the members of the\r\nHouse rising, and the Speaker advancing to meet the Vice-President.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle was grand and moving. Tears gathered in eyes long unused\r\nto them, and at an almost imperceptible nod of the President’s head, the\r\nChaplain raised his voice in prayer. He prayed in accents that were so\r\ngentle and so persuasive, they must have turned the hardest heart to\r\nblessed thoughts of peace and love and fraternity and union. And then\r\nagain all eyes were fixed with intensest strain upon the face of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen of the House of Representatives, this measure upon which you\r\nare now deliberating”——\r\n\r\nWith a sudden blow that startled every living soul within its hearing,\r\nthe Speaker’s gavel fell. “The President,” said he with a superb dignity\r\nthat called down from the galleries a burst of deafening applause, “must\r\nnot make reference to pending legislation. The Constitution guarantees\r\nhim the right ‘from time to time to give to the Congress information of\r\nthe Union.’ He must keep himself strictly within the lines of this\r\nConstitutional limit, or withdraw from the bar of the House.”\r\n\r\nA deadly pallor overspread the face of the Chief Magistrate till it\r\nseemed he must sink then and there into that sleep which knows no\r\nawakening, but he gasped, he leaned forward, he raised his hand again\r\nimploringly, and as he did so, the bells of the city began to toll the\r\nhour of midnight.\r\n\r\nThe New Year, the New Century was born, but with the last stroke, a\r\nfearful and thunderous discharge as of a thousand monster pieces of\r\nartillery, shook the Capitol to its very foundations, making the\r\nstoutest hearts stand still, and blanching cheeks that had never known\r\nthe coward color. The dome of the Capitol had been destroyed by\r\ndynamite.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments, when it was seen that the Chamber had suffered no\r\nharm, the leader of the House moved the final passage of the Act. The\r\nPresident was led away, and the Republican Senators and Representatives\r\npassed slowly out of the disfigured Capitol, while the tellers prepared\r\nto take the vote of the House. The bells were ringing a glad welcome to\r\nthe New Century, but a solemn tolling would have been a fitter thing,\r\nfor the Republic of Washington was no more. It had died so peacefully,\r\nthat the world could not believe the tidings of its passing away. As the\r\ndawn broke cold and gray, and its first dim light fell upon that\r\nshattered dome, glorious even in its ruins, a single human eye, filled\r\nwith a gleam of devilish joy, looked up at it long and steadily, and\r\nthen its owner was caught up and lost in the surging mass of humanity\r\nthat held the Capitol girt round and round.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.
