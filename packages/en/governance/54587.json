Arthur's _The Pope, the Kings, and the People_, it is right to say\r\nthat, by a restriction of my own choosing--for the publishers were\r\ngood enough to leave me a considerable discretion,--my editorial care\r\nhas been limited to the work of abridgment.[1] It was clear from the\r\nfirst that in the short time at my disposal no attempt could be made to\r\nverify the multitude of Mr. Arthur's references and quotations, drawn\r\nas they were with a lavish hand from the contemporary literature of\r\nhalf Europe. Happily, all his readers must recognise how intelligent,\r\nlaborious and scrupulous he has been. On the other hand, I had hoped to\r\nadd a certain number of footnotes explanatory of allusions to events\r\nand circumstances that are much less fresh in the public memory to-day\r\nthan they were twenty-six years ago. I should also greatly have liked\r\nto point out the extent, sometimes remarkable, to which Mr. Arthur's\r\nforecasts have been already verified. But I soon found that if I were\r\nto introduce fresh matter it must be at the expense of portions of\r\nthe original edition that were not to be lightly discarded. I have\r\ntherefore directed my efforts to adapting the book as far as possible\r\nto the requirements of the present time by the process of simple\r\nretrenchment.\r\n\r\nThis process I have carried out most scrupulously. Every word in the\r\nabridgment is Mr. Arthur's own, and in Mr. Arthur's order. I have not\r\neven allowed myself to supply insignificant connecting words, however\r\nconvenient they might have been, or however plainly they might be\r\nimplied in the original work. This rule has entailed extra labour, but\r\nthe gain seems to me immense. Every reader of this abridgment may know\r\nthat he is reading Mr. Arthur's _ipsissima verba_, and that he may\r\nsafely quote them as such. Not one word is mine.\r\n\r\nAnd here I may perhaps be allowed to express my opinion that Mr.\r\nArthur's words deserve to be very widely read and quoted. It would be\r\nhard to find a book that would shed more light on many of the most\r\nurgent questions of to-day. As an _annus mirabilis_ of history, 1870\r\nmay yet take its place with 1453 or 1789. It was the year in which the\r\nJesuits signalized the triumphant consummation of a struggle, waged\r\nduring more than three centuries, for the capture of the Papacy. It\r\nwas the year in which the new Vaticanism was formally constituted,\r\nand in which it gave the world notice, plainly and ostentatiously, of\r\nthe policy to which it held itself committed. It was also the year of\r\nthe Franco-Prussian war, a mighty convulsion which was after all but\r\nan incident in the great drama of Vaticanism, as Mr. Arthur, amongst\r\nothers, has clearly shown.\r\n\r\nI have said elsewhere that \"the Jesuits, who brought France to the\r\nverge of ruin in 1870, seemed on the very point of completing their\r\nwork of destruction a year or two since; and [that] he would be a very\r\nbold man who would dare to say that the peril had passed even yet.\"[2]\r\nThe writer who makes such a statement assumes a grave responsibility;\r\nbut if any one wishes to know how abundantly the statement can be\r\njustified he has only to turn to Mr. Arthur's pages. Mr. Arthur\r\ndemands from us no confiding trustfulness. Even at some expense to\r\nthe flow of his narrative, he wisely made his work a repertory of\r\ncontemporary documents, either transcribed entire or quoted with great\r\nfulness. Without resort to _ex parte_ representations of adversaries,\r\nwe may thus learn from the Vatican's own organs that clerical\r\neducation, which has so signally proved itself the bane of modern\r\nFrance, is the very groundwork of Vaticanism. And from the impressive\r\npicture of the remorse that embittered Montalembert's last hours as\r\nhe looked back on the share he had taken long before in shaping the\r\neducational policy of his country, we may perhaps learn the great\r\nlesson of distinguishing between a false liberalism and the true.\r\n\r\nNever more than in this instance is the history of the past the key to\r\nthe present; and no man, unless his acquaintance with Vaticanism is\r\nof quite exceptional extent, can rise from the perusal of this book\r\nwithout feeling that he has obtained a momentous and far-reaching\r\naddition to his stock of religious and, perhaps even more, of political\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n W. BLAIR NEATBY.\r\n\r\n _November, 1903._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sources of the information contained in this work are, 1. Official\r\ndocuments; 2. Histories having the sanction of the Pope or of bishops;\r\n3. Scholastic works of the present pontificate, and of recognized\r\nauthority; 4. Periodicals and journals, avowed organs of the Vatican\r\nor of its policy, with books and pamphlets by bishops and other\r\nUltramontane writers; 5. The writings of Liberal Catholics.\r\n\r\nOf the official documents the greater part have been officially\r\npublished. The list of authorities, and the references in each\r\nparticular case, will sufficiently indicate where these are to be\r\nfound. Besides these, the _Documenta ad Illustrandum_ of Professor\r\nFriedrich are a store of documents of special value, both in themselves\r\nand as throwing light upon those officially published. They came into\r\nhis hands as an official theologian at the Vatican Council, and he\r\npublished them on his own responsibility. The _Sammlung_ of Friedberg\r\nis a vast store, combining the documents of the Vatican with those of\r\nCourts, public bodies, and important individuals.\r\n\r\nThe official history of Cecconi, now Archbishop of Florence, though\r\nprofessedly that of the Vatican Council, is really occupied with the\r\nsecret history of the five years preceding the Council. That very\r\ncurious narrative throws a light back on the foregoing years, and a\r\nlight forward upon the Council, by aid of which many things otherwise\r\nindistinct become well defined. I have waited in hope that a second\r\nvolume would appear, but in vain. The eight superb folios of Victor\r\nFrond come out with an assurance, under the Pope's own hand, of being\r\npreserved by due oversight from error, and with a guarantee of divine\r\npatronage. They contain a life of the Pope, biographical notices of\r\nthe Cardinals and prelates, a full account of ceremonies, authentic\r\nportraits of men and vestments, with pictures of \"functions,\" and so\r\ncontribute to enable one to set events in their frames, and to invest\r\nthem with their colours. Except military annals, perhaps, no history\r\never had more colour than this portion of Papal history, and perhaps\r\nin no history whatever has the action been more deeply affected by\r\nthe scenery. The _Civiltá Cattolica_ fulfils the invaluable office\r\nof a serial history, in the pages of which official documents and\r\nthe chronicle of events illustrate one another, and at the same time\r\ndiscussions often prepare the way both for documents and for events,\r\nand always follow and elucidate any that are of consequence. The same\r\noffice is in a less degree also fulfilled by the _Stimmen aus Maria\r\nLaach_.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the height of authority on which the _Civiltá_ stands,\r\nthe reader should bear in mind the fact that in 1866,[3] after it had\r\nalready for sixteen years been recognized as the organ, at one and the\r\nsame time, of the Pope himself and of the Company of Jesus to which its\r\neditors belonged, his Holiness in a brief and by a declared exercise\r\nof apostolic authority, formally erected _in perpetuity_ the Jesuit\r\nFathers who composed the editorial staff into a _College of Writers_,\r\nwhich college should be under the General of the Society of Jesus,\r\nbut, it is added, so \"as to Us and to Our successors shall seem most\r\nexpedient.\" In this brief the Pontiff recorded, as to the past, the\r\n\"exceeding gladness of soul\" he had felt in witnessing the labour,\r\nerudition, zeal, and talent with which the _Civiltá_ had \"manfully\r\nprotected and defended the supreme dignity, authority, power and\r\nrights\" of the Apostolic See, and had \"set forth and propagated the\r\n_true doctrine_.\" He also recorded the fact that all this had day by\r\nday more and more merited the \"goodwill, esteem and praise,\" not only\r\nof the hierarchy, but of men of the greatest eminence, and of all the\r\ngood. This, coming at a time when the expositions of the Encyclical and\r\nSyllabus given by the _Civiltá_ had awakened among Liberal Catholics\r\nserious opposition and even alarm, was decisive as to what was, at\r\nRome, held to be the _true doctrine_, and as to who were held to be its\r\nreal teachers. As to the future, the Pontiff, adopting the well known\r\nmotto of the Company of Jesus, decreed that, _for the greater glory of\r\nGod_, the writers should, as we have said, constitute _in perpetuity a\r\ncollege_ possessing peculiar rights and privileges. As if formally to\r\nclaim some share of this glory, the Jesuit editors of the _Stimmen aus\r\nMaria Laach_, when in 1869 commencing a new series, notified on their\r\ntitle-page the fact that they availed themselves of the labours of\r\nthe _Civiltá_--a liberty which no Jesuit durst have taken without the\r\nhighest sanction.\r\n\r\nAll the numbers of the _Civiltá_ and of the _Stimmen_ being under\r\nmy hand, they have yielded a steady light by which to examine\r\nopinions relating to the movement of \"reconstruction,\" whether\r\nthose opinions were hostile or sympathetic. The Italian journal,\r\nthe _Unitá Cattolica_, and the French one, the _Univers_, written\r\nwith a consciousness of the highest favour on the one hand and of an\r\noverwhelming influence among the clergy on the other, comment upon\r\nthe operative clauses of official documents--generally intelligible\r\nonly to the initiated--in forms more popular than those of the two\r\ngreat magazines. But it is only by the still clearer comment of daily\r\nnarratives and polemics that the elucidation becomes complete.\r\n\r\nThe Roman work of the Marchese Francesco Vitelleschi (Pomponio Leto)\r\nhas now appeared in English--_Eight Months at Rome_ (Murray). This is\r\nwelcome, as enabling one to refer the English reader to his pages, of\r\nwhich even Ultramontanes in Rome do not impugn the accuracy. _Quirinus_\r\nis also happily in English. Professor Friedrich's _Tagebuch_ ought to\r\nbe, but is not. Those and smaller works by Liberal Catholics, compared\r\nwith the sparkling volumes of M. Louis Veuillot and the Ultramontane\r\nserials and pamphlets, and with the Old Catholic writers in the\r\n_Rheinischer Merkur_, the _Literaturblatt_ of Bonn, the _Stimmen aus\r\nder Katholischen Kirche_, and so forth, slowly bring home to our\r\nEnglish understanding the strange principles and wonderful projects\r\nwhich at first we either fail to apprehend, or else imagine that they\r\ncannot be seriously entertained.\r\n\r\nOn those principles and projects four distinct controversies have shed\r\na steadily increasing light--the controversy on, 1. The Syllabus; 2.\r\nThe Vatican Council; 3. The Old Catholic Movement; 4. The Falk Laws.\r\nThe last two do not come within the scope of this work, but very much\r\nof the light by which we gradually come to understand the preceding\r\nstages of the movement, is due to the keen discussions to which these\r\ntwo controversies have given rise.\r\n\r\nHaving subscribed for the _Civiltá Cattolica_ for years before the\r\nSyllabus appeared, I was not wholly unprepared for the controversy\r\nwhich followed. The _Civiltá_ also enabled me to see how Liberal\r\nCatholics connected the Vatican Council with a movement in the past,\r\ndating from the Pope's restoration, and with a plan of vast changes\r\nfor the future. While the hopes of the Ultramontanes seemed visionary,\r\nand the fears of the Liberal Catholics seemed exaggerated, it did\r\nnevertheless appear possible that great events might come out of a\r\ndeliberate attempt, made by a large and organized force, to reconstruct\r\nthe world. Soon after the close of the Franco-German war, a visit to\r\nParis, Munich, Vienna, Berlin, Brussels, and other centres, supplied\r\nme with much material, casting light on the enterprise in which the\r\nVatican Council was the legislative episode, and from which the Old\r\nCatholic movement was the recoil.\r\n\r\nIt was while engaged in studying such material that I threw off the\r\ntranslation of the discussion held in Rome on the question whether St.\r\nPeter had ever visited that city. Soon after broke out the controversy\r\non the Falk Laws. Six weeks spent in a German country town, reading\r\njournals and pamphlets, and also in collecting, added to my light,\r\nand to the means of getting further light. In the course of the time\r\nemployed upon the study of growing material was thrown off the review\r\nof the Pope's Speeches, under the title of _The Modern Jove_.\r\n\r\nThough conscious that I had not yet the groundwork for a well connected\r\naccount of the whole movement, I began to write, not with any intention\r\nof publishing for a long time, should I live, but under the feeling\r\nthat, should I be called away, it would be right to leave behind me\r\ninformation which had not been gained without cost and labour. After\r\na while appeared the official history of Cecconi. His authentic if\r\nincomplete disclosure of the secret proceedings of five years was a\r\nstem for many hitherto perplexing branches. A plan now began to shape\r\nitself, and I commenced to recast all I had done. Shortly afterwards\r\ncame out the great work of Theiner, the _Acta Genuina_ of the Council\r\nof Trent. This settled many points keenly debated between Catholic and\r\nLiberal Catholic, affecting the rights of kings, of bishops, of the\r\ndivinity schools, of the lower clergy, of the laity, and affecting the\r\nrelations of all these to the Pontiff.\r\n\r\nWhile I was working with these additional helps appeared Mr.\r\nGladstone's _Expostulation_. The great amount of knowledge it betrayed\r\ncontrasted with one's previous idea of the state of information on the\r\nsubject among our public men. The controversy which followed might have\r\nbrought some temptation to haste, had it not also brought proof that it\r\nwas even more necessary than I had supposed to beware of assuming that\r\nphrases, modes of conception, and projects, well understood in Italy or\r\nGermany, were at all understood here. Some of those who reviewed Mr.\r\nGladstone took for strange what in all countries in the south or centre\r\nof Europe would have been taken as familiar, and for doubtful what in\r\nRome or Munich was as clear as day. Accredited terms and phrases were\r\ntreated as inventions; by some as inventions of genius, by others of\r\nanimosity. It was often more than hinted that principles and designs\r\nhabitually proclaimed at the Vatican were ascribed to priests only by\r\nopponents. Not unfrequently a gentleman would seem to think it more\r\ngenerous to attribute his Protestant ideas to Ultramontanes, than to\r\ntake it for granted that they preferred their own. It was incredible\r\nhow political questions pregnant with future controversies, perhaps\r\nwith future wars, were evaded as theology!\r\n\r\nThe replies to Mr. Gladstone placed the ignorance of the English public\r\non the subject in a different but a very impressive light. It is\r\noften said abroad, by those who know us, that no nation in Europe is\r\nso liable as we are to treat gravely statements from priests or their\r\nadvocates which any reasonable amount of information would render\r\nentertaining. The reviews of these replies showed a growing sense of\r\nthe interests involved, but intensified one's feeling that the elements\r\nof clear understanding were wanting. Men did not know the terms, the\r\nfacts, the publications, or the political doctrines of the movements\r\nunder discussion. Had what has been written in our best journals during\r\nthe last twenty years from Italy, or even during the last five from\r\nRome and Berlin, been well read, it would have led to study, and in\r\nthat case Dr. Newman and others would not have had so cheap a laugh\r\nat our ignorance of what is meant because of our false interpretation\r\nof what is said. While this controversy proceeded, a stay of nearly\r\nthree months in Rome, employed in seeking material and information,\r\nadded considerably to my stores, which were further increased by two\r\nsubsequent visits to Munich and one to Bonn.\r\n\r\nI have often been reminded of an incident which occurred in Rome. One\r\nof our celebrated scholars, hearing what I was engaged in, exclaimed\r\n\"Oh, Theology!\" Of course, he was fresh from home. Not many minutes\r\nbefore, a resident diplomatist, in whose house this took place,\r\nhaving heard me say \"I began the study of this subject as a religious\r\nquestion, _but_--\" smiled and said, \"Yes, _but_--you find it is all\r\npolitics, and the further you get into it the more purely political\r\nwill you find it.\"\r\n\r\nThe controversy which had sprung up at home showed that a book written\r\nas this one had been begun would be frequently misunderstood. In that\r\ncontroversy it was often taken for granted that when an Ultramontane\r\ndisclaims Temporal Power, he disclaims power over temporal things;\r\nand that when he writes Spiritual Power, he means only power over\r\nspiritual things; that when he writes Religious Liberty, he means\r\nfreedom for every one to worship God according to his conscience; that\r\nwhen he writes the Divine Law, he means only the Ten Commandments\r\nand the precepts of the Gospel; that when he writes the Kingdom of\r\nGod, he means righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost; and\r\nthat when he writes the Word of God, he simply means the Bible. One\r\nreasoning with false interpretations like these in his mind must reason\r\nin such a fog as Dr. Newman, in his letter to the Duke of Norfolk,\r\ncleverly depicts. Ambiguity similar to that now indicated prevails\r\nover the whole field of phraseology--theological, political, and\r\neducational. English Ultramontanes are doubtless in part responsible\r\nfor these misapprehensions, but only in part. If their writings are\r\n_studied_, they will be seen to use such terms differently from their\r\nfellow-countrymen. But certainly the Papal Press of Rome, and even that\r\nof France, is not in any degree responsible for our illusions, but has,\r\non the contrary, left us without excuse.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of all this is that in this book, where a mere allusion\r\nwould have been made, a fact is now often related; where the sense of\r\nsome particular utterance would have been condensed, that utterance is\r\nverbally recited; and where one sentence would have been culled out,\r\nmore are given. Very often, where a statement of the principles of the\r\nPapal movement would have been accompanied only by a reference to a\r\ncontemporary authority, that authority is made to speak for himself,\r\nand occasionally at some length. Terms and phrases, which might have\r\nbeen left to the chance of being understood, are either coupled with\r\nnarratives or discussions, to bring out their sense, or else they\r\nare explained. When I do give explanations, let me not be trusted,\r\nbut watched. Much will be found of the language both of Catholics\r\nand of Liberal Catholics, and with it the reader can confront my\r\nstrange-looking explanations. In the end he will be able to do what,\r\nthank God, every Englishman is inclined to do--form an opinion for\r\nhimself as to the real sense in which the speakers employed their own\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nIt need not be said that this change of method rendered necessary a\r\nlarger book than was at first planned. It was also unfavourable to\r\nthe flow and unity of the narrative. Perhaps it compensated for that\r\ndisadvantage by more fully showing the grounds on which statements\r\nare made, and by bringing the reader frequently, almost continuously,\r\ninto communication with Italian, Frenchman or German, each expressing\r\nhis own views, whether those of statesman or priest, of journalist or\r\nmagistrate, of Catholic or of Liberal Catholic.\r\n\r\nMy thanks are due to many who have forwarded my researches. The\r\nkindness of Count Cadorna, then Italian Minister at our Court, procured\r\nfor me valuable facilities in Rome. My true gratitude was deserved by\r\nthe distinguished Minister of Education, Signor Bonghi, especially for\r\nhis personal introduction of me to the great library of the Collegio\r\nRomano, not then open to the public. Our own Ambassador, Sir Augustus\r\nPaget, and the German Ambassador, Baron Keudell, both rendered me\r\nreal service, with all possible courtesy. The Marchese Francesco\r\nNobili-Vitelleschi, himself author of a history on which I must often\r\ndraw, took pains to procure for me valuable material. Among many\r\nbenefits received from our own countrymen, I must specify that derived\r\nfrom the vast information on all Italian matters possessed by Mr.\r\nMontgomery Stuart, and also that arising from the constant kindness of\r\nthe Rev. H.J. Piggott. Those two gentlemen have kindly read on the spot\r\ncertain sheets containing local observations. Two German scholars were\r\nconstant and practical friends, Dr. Benrath and Dr. Richter.\r\n\r\nIn Munich the National Library, with its clear catalogue and good\r\ncollection, contrasted with the great libraries of Rome. The kindness\r\nof Dr. Döllinger was great and eminently practical. He had kept all\r\npamphlets, bearing on the subject, which had come into his hands.\r\nHe not only gave me free access to this collection, but, where he\r\nhad duplicates, presented me with them. Dr. Reusch, Professor of the\r\nUniversity of Bonn, with a collection at least equal, though without\r\nduplicates, gave me similar facilities. The lists thus procured,\r\nand the energy of the German booksellers, enabled me to get almost\r\neverything contained in either collection, including Italian and Latin\r\npublications which I had in vain sought in Italy, and even French ones\r\nwhich I could not find in Paris.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of my own eyesight has increased the obligation which, in\r\nany case, I should have felt to my two valued friends. Dr. Moulton and\r\nDr. H.W. Williams, who have kindly read the proofs. Dr. Moulton also\r\ncompared the translation of the speech of Darboy with the original, and\r\nsuggested improvements. Dr. Karl Benrath, of Bonn, whose long residence\r\nin Rome and whose study of the subject lent to his judgment a special\r\nvalue, has laid me under great obligation by examining every sheet as\r\nit passed through the press.\r\n\r\nThe very frequent translations rendered necessary by the plan of\r\nletting men speak for themselves are as close as I knew how to make\r\nthem. Even where marks of quotation are not used, and yet I profess to\r\ngive the sense of some utterance, those who can go to the originals\r\nwill find that the language, though condensed, is preserved, and, in\r\nany important matter, closely rendered.\r\n\r\nReversing the ordinary practice as to quotations, where the italics\r\nwere in the original, I generally mention that it was so. It would have\r\nbeen tedious to say that they were my own in every case where they\r\nseemed necessary to direct attention to a phrase or a term having a\r\nmeaning different from ours, or to one the full significance of which\r\nmight easily escape notice.\r\n\r\nNothing but a conviction that the movement here traced is of an\r\nimportance for which ordinary terms are not an adequate expression\r\nwould have justified me, in my own view, in giving to the study of\r\nit years of a life now far advanced. If the authors of the movement\r\nare not deceived, the generations that will come up after I am no\r\nmore will witness a struggle on the widest scale, and of very long\r\nduration, during which will disappear all that to us is known as modern\r\nliberties, all that to Rome is known as the Modern State, and at the\r\nclose of which the ecclesiastical power will stand alone, presiding\r\nover the destinies of a reconstituted world. Not at all believing in\r\nthe possibility of this issue, I do not disbelieve in the possibility\r\nof the struggle. To avert any such repetition of past horrors, to turn\r\nthe war into a war of thought, a war with the sword of the writer and\r\nof the orator, instead of that of the zouave and the dragoon, is an\r\nobject in attempting to serve which, however humbly, a good man might\r\nbe content to die. Had I at any time during my preparations seen the\r\nsame work undertaken by some one whose position or whose name would\r\nhave commanded a degree of attention to which I have no claim, gladly\r\nshould I have buried the fruit of my labour. Such as that fruit is,\r\nI now submit it to the public, in humble hope that the very absence\r\nof titles to consideration by which a work on the subject should have\r\nbeen recommended, will turn to a plea for more indulgence in weighing\r\nthe only claims I have to put forth, those of hard work and honest\r\nintention.\r\n\r\nMay He who has given to our nation the blessings of free prayer, free\r\npreaching, free writing, free speech, and free assembly, with their\r\nwholesome fruit of equal laws, tempered power, and moderated liberty,\r\ngrant that this humble labour may in some measure contribute to make\r\nthose inestimable boons dearer than ever to the hearts of our people,\r\nand that it may contribute also to place them in a position more\r\nreadily to foil every endeavour to snatch those boons or to steal them\r\naway from us and from mankind!\r\n\r\nCLAPHAM COMMON, 1877.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Considerably more than a fifth of the original matter has\r\nbeen omitted. Whenever a quotation has been abridged, the usual marks\r\nhave been employed to indicate the hiatus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _The Programme of the Jesuits_, Preface, p. v.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See _Civiltá_, Serie VI. vol vi. pp. 5-15.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT TO THE PREFACE\r\n\r\n_June 6, 1877_\r\n\r\nON CARDINAL MANNING'S \"TRUE STORY OF THE VATICAN COUNCIL\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHad not the time occupied in bringing out this work far exceeded my\r\nexpectations, it would have appeared as early as the first portion of\r\nCardinal Manning's \"True Story of the Vatican Council,\" in the pages of\r\nthe _Nineteenth Century_. As it is, I have been able to read the fourth\r\npaper, in which the Cardinal concludes his narrative of the Council\r\nitself, though he intimates an intention of hereafter adding comments\r\non extraneous matters. I cannot but feel that, in more respects than\r\none, the appearance of the _True Story_ immediately before that of this\r\nbook is an advantage. The general reader is thus supplied with means\r\nof checking many of my statements, and of estimating the value of my\r\nauthorities. Although this advantage is limited to such ground as is\r\ncommon to the _True Story_ and to my history, that ground is a portion\r\nof sufficient importance to afford some criterion for judging of the\r\nwhole. One of my fears, arising from the way in which, both in recent\r\ncontroversies and in former ones, authorities have been dealt with\r\nbefore the English public, was that we might find it soberly intimated\r\nthat Cecconi was not a writer of high credit, that the _Civiltá\r\nCattolica_ was a private magazine, that the _Acta Genuina_ of Theiner\r\nwas a publication brought out in an obscure place, and so on through\r\nthe list. Now, however, the reliance placed by Cardinal Manning on\r\nauthorities which supply essential features of my narrative, and the\r\nimportance unwillingly assigned by him to others frequently cited by\r\nme, will act as a restraint on those who might have made light of them.\r\n\r\nAnother considerable advantage is this. It almost seemed as if it\r\nwould prejudice Englishmen against a writer to state what from time to\r\ntime it was needful to intimate--how histories issued from official or\r\nsemi-official sources systematically withheld information on the points\r\nof chief importance. Such points, so far as the Council was concerned,\r\nwere the actual differences of opinion between prelate and prelate, the\r\ntenor of the debates, the arguments employed on one side or the other,\r\nthe written memoranda of bishops on the questions disputed, their\r\nprinted pamphlets, their speeches, their truly important petitions,\r\nrecording complaints against the Rules of Procedure imposed upon them,\r\nand against the disabilities under which the Pope had placed them.\r\nThose petitions recorded, further, their personal disbelief in the new\r\ndogma, with the fact that they had always taught in opposition to it,\r\nand that they anticipated from its adoption grave perils of collision\r\nbetween Church and State. Other matters kept out of view comprised\r\ninteresting facts credibly alleged and circumstantially detailed\r\nrelating to personal acts of the Pope, to proceedings of the Curia and\r\nof the Presidents of the Council. Still more interesting, and of graver\r\nimport, were the reasons assigned by Ministers of State and others, for\r\nregarding with more than ordinary jealousy the projected changes in\r\nthe Papal system. It seemed even more invidious to note the practice\r\nof adopting, in order to cover all these suppressions of facts, and of\r\nalleged facts, an air of giving information by entering into details\r\nof ceremonies, enlarging on unimportant matters, telling, as if it was\r\nof great moment, how many meetings of this sort were held, how many of\r\nthat, how many spoke, at what time this Decree was proposed, and how\r\nmany votes were taken on another, without in all this allowing a word\r\nto transpire of what was said or thought. I am now relieved of all fear\r\nabout those features of my narrative. Any one who has a relish for the\r\ncuriosities of literature may match, and perhaps overmatch, what I\r\nhave told of French priests and Italian Jesuits, by what an Englishman\r\nhas done.\r\n\r\nI had never, however, to accuse the Italian Jesuits of keeping out of\r\nsight the political, or, as they generally say, the social aspects of\r\nthe movement, and of covering them up in theological disquisitions.\r\nThey did, indeed, use wondrous theological phrases with political\r\nmeanings, but any one who studied their writings soon penetrated\r\nthat veil. They also invariably used theology as the motive power\r\nof all their politics. But from 1850, when the movement which has\r\ncharacterized the present pontificate began, to 1870, when it reached\r\nits legislative climax, they set forth prominently as their object\r\nthe reconstruction of society, on the model of what, in their own\r\ndialect, they call the Christian civilization. They loudly proclaimed,\r\nas the elements of that Christian civilization, the revocation of\r\nconstitutions, the abolition of modern liberties, especially those of\r\nthe Press and of worship, with the subjection to canon law of civil\r\nlaw, and, above all, the subjection to the jurisdiction of the Pope\r\nof all nations and their rulers, whatever the title of those rulers\r\nmight be. They justly conceived the ills they had to repair, as, having\r\nbegun with the bad teaching of John Wyclif, in which his doctrine of\r\n\"dominion\" was the head and front of all his offending, and of that of\r\nevery succeeding age. As he had striven for the emancipation of kings\r\nfrom the Pope, of legislatures from the ecclesiastical powers, and of\r\nthe individual from the priest, so did they set themselves to bring\r\nback again the dominion of the priest over the individual, the dominion\r\nof the ecclesiastical authorities over lawgivers, and above all, the\r\ndominion of the Pope over kings. Of this the reader will meet with\r\nevidence from their own lips, at almost every stage of our narrative.\r\nThose Italian Jesuits did not expound the Syllabus, according to the\r\nnew and _naive_ notion of Cardinal Manning, as a code containing very\r\nlittle to which \"any sincere believer in Christian revelation would,\r\nif he understood the Syllabus, object.\" The Italian Jesuits, ay, and\r\neven the German ones, on the contrary, made a boast of its diametrical\r\nopposition to every form of Liberalism, and in particular to Liberal\r\nCatholicism, of its efficacy as an instrument for overturning the\r\nModern State, and of its solidity as the foundation-stone on which was\r\nto be reared the fabric of reconstructed society. In all their writings\r\nsociety was taken as meaning, not families, nor Churches, but nations,\r\nand each one of the nations was to form a province within a Church\r\nruling over it and over all other nations in every one of their laws\r\nand public institutions.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the idea that all believers in revelation would accept\r\nnearly all of the Syllabus, I have assumed that Cardinal Manning,\r\nwriting for an English audience, uses the term \"Christian revelation\"\r\nin the English and not in the Papal sense. To a sincere believer in\r\nChristian revelation in the Papal sense, the Syllabus, if not in\r\nform, yet in substance, is an infallible and \"irreformable\" portion\r\nof that revelation. And so it would very simply come to pass that a\r\nsincere believer in Christian revelation would admit, not merely most\r\nof it, but all of it so far as it contains any teaching. And to such\r\na believer the kingdoms of the world will never become the kingdom of\r\nGod, and of His Christ, but by ceasing to be kingdoms at all in any\r\nindependent and proper sense, and by merging into provinces under the\r\nPriest and King, or, as in phrases still more mystic they style him,\r\nthe Shepherd-King of the Vatican.\r\n\r\nNow a _True Story_ of the Vatican Council, in which, to the\r\napprehension of an ordinary reader, all these topics are kept out of\r\nview, though to an adept they are not wholly kept out, seems to me\r\nlike a _True Story_ of the civil war in the United States which should\r\nlargely dwell upon State rights, forgetting all about slavery, or\r\nspeaking of it only in an esoteric dialect.\r\n\r\nThe _True Story_ affords us some foretaste of what history is to be\r\nafter dogma has completed the conquest over it which has been promised.\r\nHad my narrative been written after its appearance, the topics totally\r\nignored, and those virtually ignored, in the _True Story_, might\r\neasily have been thrown into stronger relief. As it is, however, the\r\nsuccession of events necessarily brings them again and again into view,\r\nand perhaps the effect of the outline may be rendered more distinct to\r\nthe English reader through the contrast with the _True Story_.\r\n\r\nOf the prelates on this side of the Alps, Cardinal Manning was not the\r\none from whom we should have expected that in an account of the five\r\nyears preceding the Vatican Council, with a brief retrospect of the\r\nwhole of the present pontificate, and a history of the Council itself,\r\nscarcely one clear utterance should be made as to the bearing of the\r\nmovement on those governments, liberties and institutions which to the\r\nVatican are very evil and to us are very dear. It was not so in 1867\r\nand 1869. In both of those years the Cardinal indicated the political\r\nrelations of the movement in words of warning which, if only echoes\r\nof those of the Jesuits in Rome, were perhaps more intelligible and\r\nvehement than those of any other prelate on this side of the Alps.\r\n\r\nStatements of mine will frequently be found to conflict with statements\r\nmade in the _True Story_. In most of those cases--I hope in all--the\r\nmaterials from known sources furnished to the general reader will\r\nsuffice for a not unsatisfactory comparison, while the authorities\r\nindicated will enable the scholar to form a judgment. In very many of\r\nthese cases statements of Cardinal Manning, made in previous works and\r\nvirtually amounting to the same as the most material of those made in\r\nthe _True Story_, will be found side by side with the statements of\r\nother authorities, with official documents, or with facts no longer\r\ndisputable. Of these statements, one to which the Cardinal seems to\r\nattach much importance is his assertion that none of the prelates, or\r\nat most a number under five, disbelieved or denied the dogma of Papal\r\ninfallibility, and that all their objections turned on questions of\r\nprudence. This is not a slip, nor a hasty assertion, and it is very\r\nfar from being peculiar to Cardinal Manning. It is now the harmonious\r\nrefrain of all that hierarchy of strange witnesses of which he has made\r\nhimself a part. The point is one on which illustrations will occur\r\nagain and again, in events, in words, and in those documents which, in\r\nspite of all precautions, have been gained to publicity.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the method adopted in the _True Story_, the fact\r\ncrops out at every turn that the modern strife of the Papacy is not\r\nto make men and women, as such, godly and peaceable, but to bring\r\nkings as kings, and legislatures as legislatures, and nations as\r\nnations, into subjection to the Pope. It crops out sufficiently, at\r\nleast, to be obvious to all who know the difference, in the Cardinal's\r\nphraseology, between the two sets of terms employed to indicate those\r\ntwo distinct objects. For instance, what an excellent description\r\nof that _Catholic Civilization_ which, in the great contest of the\r\nVatican, is ever signalized as the goal, does the Cardinal give\r\nwhen, picturing the \"public life and laws and living organization of\r\nChristendom\" in the times when all these, according to his ideas,\r\nwere \"Christian,\" he says, \"_Princes and legislatures and society_\r\nprofessed the Catholic faith, and were _subject to the head_ of the\r\nCatholic Church.\" Cardinal Manning does not here use the word \"society\"\r\nin the domestic but in the political sense. He means, not families\r\nor social parties, but nations--as the Jesuit writers almost always\r\ndo. Any one may, therefore, possess himself of a key to the true\r\nmeaning of many pious phrases which occur in the following pages, if\r\nhe will first of all clearly realize in his own thoughts just what\r\nit would involve for England; and for us were the conditions stated\r\nby the Cardinal fulfilled by our princes, our legislature, and our\r\n\"society.\" One seeking to do this must realize the fact that the prince\r\nand the legislature not as individuals, and the \"society\" not in its\r\nseparate members, but the prince as a prince, the legislature as a\r\nlegislature, and the nation as a society, shall _profess the Catholic\r\nfaith_. Ordinary Englishmen do not realize all that is meant by that\r\nformula. But beyond that, the prince as a prince, the legislature as\r\na legislature, the nation as a society, are not only to believe in\r\nthe Pope, but to be _subject to him_. What fulness of meaning that\r\nformula possesses will gradually open up to the reader as the narrative\r\nunfolds. He will often hear ecclesiastical politicians of the school to\r\nwhich Cardinal Manning belongs, talking in their native dialect, not\r\nmodulating their voice to win the are of Protestants. This national\r\n_profession of the faith_, and this subjection of kings, lawgivers, and\r\nnations to the Pope, constitute in one word the _Civiltá Cattolica_\r\n(the Catholic civilization); or, in plain English, the Catholic civil\r\nsystem; or, in other terms, the true Catholic constitution, the reign\r\nof Christ over the world, to establish which in all nations the Vatican\r\nis to move heaven and earth.\r\n\r\nIn his first paper Cardinal Manning seeks to impress us with the belief\r\nthat the raising of Papal infallibility to the rank of a dogma was not\r\na chief object of the Pontiff, much less his only one, in convoking the\r\nVatican Council. On that point the narrative will often incidentally\r\npresent the expressions of prelates, official writers, and others,\r\nso that the reader will be able to form an opinion of his own. In\r\nhis second paper the Cardinal shows that throughout the whole of the\r\npresent pontificate the dogma has been kept in view as an essential\r\nobject. Of that position illustrations will frequently occur. In the\r\nsecond paper, also, the Cardinal repeats his old allegation that it was\r\nJanus who invented \"the fable of an acclamation.\" The course of the\r\ntale will tell whether it was or was not Janus who originated the talk\r\nof a design to get up an acclamation, and whether that talk was or was\r\nnot a fable.\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal, while attempting to justify, though for the most part\r\nkeeping out of sight, the disabilities imposed upon the bishops by\r\nthe Pope, disabilities of which they loudly complained, glances at\r\none out of many of the real ones. He says that the Commission which\r\nwas empowered to say whether any proposal emanating from a bishop\r\nwas worthy to be recommended to the Pope for consideration, without\r\nwhich recommendation it could not come before the Council, was \"a\r\nrepresentative commission.\" The fact is that it was a selection of\r\nprelates made by the Pope, who excluded from it all who had avowed\r\nthemselves opponents of his infallibility, and included in it creatures\r\nof his own, who had nothing of the bishop but the orders and the pay\r\nwhich the favour of the Court had given to them.\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal, after ample time for correction, repeats his old\r\ndeclaration that in the Vatican Council \"the liberty of speech was as\r\nperfectly secured as in our Parliament.\" That assertion has the merit\r\nof being free from all ambiguity, and moreover is one on which plain\r\nmen can judge. As I have told the story, the readers will over and over\r\nagain meet with facts, equally free from ambiguity and equally patent\r\nto plain men, which will show whether the assertion is true or not.\r\n\r\nOn the great question of secrecy the Cardinal risks a statement which\r\nexceeds what Italian Jesuits, if writing for a periodical of the rank\r\nof the _Nineteenth Century_, would be likely to hazard. He says: \"At\r\nthe beginning of the Council of Trent this precaution (of secrecy) was\r\nomitted; wherefore, on February 17, 1562, the legates were compelled to\r\nimpose the secret upon the bishops.\" The Cardinal would seem to imagine\r\nthat there was at least a substantial agreement, if not an actual\r\nidentity, between the acts by which silence was enjoined, and also\r\nbetween the extent of the silence demanded in Trent and at the Vatican;\r\nand that indeed from February 17, 1562, forwards, the Council of Trent\r\nwas laid under a bond something like that by which the Vatican Council\r\nwas from the beginning fettered. Was it so? Was there a substantial\r\nagreement in the two acts by which silence was enjoined? Was there a\r\nsubstantial agreement in the extent of silence imposed? Was there at\r\nTrent a formal decree? Was there an oath imposed on the officers? Was\r\nthere an exclusion of the theologians from debates, and of the public\r\nfrom the debates of the theologians? Was there any vow required, any\r\nthreat held out? And does even Cardinal Manning fancy that there was at\r\nTrent a new mortal sin made on purpose for the benefit of the bishops?\r\nOf all this there was nothing. The act of the legates was simply what\r\nit is described as having been by Massarellus, the Secretary of the\r\nCouncil, who says: \"The Fathers were admonished not to divulge things\r\nproposed for examination, and in particular Decrees, before they were\r\npublished in open session.\"[4]\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal is apparently also under an impression that the extent\r\nof silence imposed in the two cases was at least substantially the\r\nsame. Was that so? Did the legates censure the admission of laymen\r\nto hear the theologians argue? Did they censure the permission given\r\nto theologians who were not bishops even by the fiction of a see _in\r\npartibus_, to dispute in presence of the Council? Did they censure\r\nany remarks made out of doors on speeches, opinions or projects? Did\r\nthey censure anything but the one indiscretion of circulating proposed\r\nDecrees, or other things proposed, while yet the formulae were, \"so\r\nto speak, unshaped,\" but were in their inchoate condition made public\r\nas if they had been passed? Did the legates suggest that the duty of\r\nsecrecy extended further than that of not publishing such tentative\r\nformulae, of not sending them out of the city, and of forbidding\r\npersons attached to the households of bishops to commit those\r\nindiscretions? At Trent there were faults and causes of complaint in no\r\nsmall number. But what Cardinal Manning calls \"the secret\" which would\r\nshut up every mouth as to all subjects proposed, as to all opinions\r\nexpressed, as to all speeches made, as to all designs mooted--\"the\r\nsecret\" which forbade men to print their own speeches, to read the\r\nofficial reports taken of them, to read those of their brother bishops,\r\nand other extravagances besides, of which the _True Story_ has not one\r\nsyllable to tell--that \"secret,\" or any such, is not hinted at in the\r\na monition of the legates at Trent. The extent of silence imposed at\r\nthe Vatican would seem to have been as original as the mortal sin there\r\ninvented.\r\n\r\nStill further, the Cardinal would appear to be under an impression that\r\nthe reason why at Trent certain inconvenient publications occurred was\r\nbecause that, at the outset, the strict precautions had been there\r\nomitted which at the Vatican were not only taken in time, but, with\r\nmanifold forethought, were, before the time, as our story will tell,\r\ntied and bound by edict and by oath. As to disclosures, however, that\r\noccurred at the Vatican, which most Romans would tell any Englishman,\r\nexcept a priest or a convert, would be certain to occur, namely, that\r\nthe \"pontifical secret\" would be dealt in as a thing to be sold. Did\r\nthe precautions omitted at Trent, but adopted at the Vatican, prevent\r\nso much from transpiring as compelled the Pope to loose from the bond\r\nfour selected prelates, including the eminent author of the _True\r\nStory_, in order that they might disabuse the outside world? Did it\r\nprevent the famous canons which opened the eyes of Austrian and French\r\nstatesmen from making a quick passage to Augsburg and to Printing House\r\nSquare?--of which canons, by the way, as of most essential matters, the\r\n_True Story_ tells not a word.\r\n\r\nIt would be very tempting to select for remark other assertions of\r\nthe Cardinal, but this may suffice to do all that I here wish to do;\r\nthat is, to set the reader upon intelligently watching and sifting\r\nstatements of my own; for what is to be desired on this subject is that\r\nthe public shall cease to be easily contented with what is said on one\r\nside or the other. My statements, like those of others, are sure to\r\ncontain a fair proportion of mistakes, but when all these are winnowed\r\naway, there will remain a considerable peck of corn.\r\n\r\nNot content with formally vouching, in his title, for his own\r\ntruthfulness, the Cardinal formally impeaches that of others. Both\r\nof these proceedings would be perfectly natural in a priest in Rome,\r\nand especially in one attached to the Jesuit school. Had I foreseen\r\nthe cautious beginning of such habits that was so soon to be made by\r\nhigh authority, certainly I should not have so far yielded to the\r\nrepugnance one feels to put specimens of priestly imputations into our\r\nlanguage--a language which had for ages, up to the date of the _Tracts\r\nfor the Times_, been steadily acquiring an antipathy to all the arts\r\nof untruthfulness, and consequently to all the forms in which other\r\nlanguages habitually insinuate or openly allege it. But I cannot regret\r\nthat my story purposely excludes full specimens, and only by force of\r\nfrequent necessity admits morsels, of the style in which in Rome every\r\nshade of untruthfulness, from suppression and equivocation to the worst\r\nkinds of perjury and forgery, is on the one hand charged upon heretics,\r\non Liberal Catholics, on statesmen, and is on the other hand in return,\r\nand with extreme good will, charged upon bishops, cardinals and popes.\r\n\r\nThe veracity of Pomponio Leto--that is, as all Italy knows, of\r\nthe Marchese Francesco Vitelleschi, brother of the late Cardinal\r\nVitelleschi--is openly impugned by Cardinal Manning. We already know,\r\non more points than one, the opinion of Vitelleschi as to the eminent\r\nauthor of the _True Story_; and retaliation would have been natural\r\nhad it only been fair. If Vitelleschi wrote English, and if he cared\r\nto compare his truthfulness with that of such a competitor, it would\r\nbe interesting to hear him fairly fight out the question, Which of\r\nus two has, to the best of his power, tried just to tell what he\r\nknew, inventing nothing and concealing nothing? It does not seem at\r\nall certain that the Englishman would bear away from the Italian the\r\npalm of straightforwardness. The Cardinal is evidently not aware that\r\ncertain alleged particulars of the famous Strossmayer scene, which he\r\nascribes to Pomponio Leto, are not in his description of it either in\r\nthe Italian or in the English version. From where the Cardinal gets\r\nthem I do not know. But his picture of Schwarzenberg \"carried fainting\r\nfrom the _ambo_ to his seat,\" his idea that Pomponio professes on\r\nthat day to have been outside the Council door and to have seen \"the\r\nservants rushing,\" and his other idea that at the fourth session\r\nPomponio professes to have been inside and consequently forgot that\r\nmany of those who were outside could see through the great door which\r\nwas wide open, are all alike. He certainly did not get any of them from\r\nVitelleschi. As it is after stating these errors, that his Eminence\r\ncries, \"Such melodramatic and mendacious stuff!\" we must imagine how\r\nVitelleschi will smile at this new display of certain qualities which\r\ndid not escape his keen eye.\r\n\r\nProfessor Friedrich is slightingly spoken of by the Cardinal. Here\r\nagain retaliation, if fair, would have been natural; for Cardinal\r\nManning has already felt the steel of Friedrich. Judging from my own\r\nimpression that under the slashes of Friedrich what the Cardinal had\r\nemployed as if he took it for argument appeared perfectly helpless, I\r\nshould expect that it the learned professor should think it worth while\r\nto try his strength on the sort of history, theology, and logic which\r\nthe Cardinal thinks may pass in England, they would in his hands, at\r\nalmost every debatable point, fly to pieces. As to veracity, however,\r\nFriedrich has already, on that score, as our story will show, crossed\r\nswords with more bishops than one; and whether on that or other\r\nmatters, certainly he is not the man to turn his back on Cardinal\r\nManning, whose measure he has long ago taken, as, even under the eyes\r\nof the Papal police, he did not fear to show.\r\n\r\nCardinal Manning occupies pages with imputations, and with quotations\r\nwhich he apparently thinks warrant the imputations. Does he, or do the\r\nwitnesses he calls, disprove any of the specific facts alleged? Yes,\r\nhe does disprove one. Vitelleschi, in describing the great session of\r\nthe Council, said that Cardinal Corsi and other discontented Cardinals\r\npulled down their red hats over their eyes. Now, Cardinal Manning\r\nproperly says that on that occasion they had no hats of any colour,\r\nmeaning that they wore the mitre. Therefore a real blot is hit. And it\r\nis curious how exactly this is the same kind of blot as the Jesuits\r\nof the _Civiltá_ were able to hit in the early part of Vitelleschi's\r\nbook, when, like the _True Story_, it first appeared in a periodical.\r\nThey clearly convicted the author, then unknown even to them, of saying\r\nthat in certain solemnities the robes were red, whereas in fact they\r\nwere white. We must, however, do the Roman Jesuits the justice to say\r\nthat from this tremendous error they did not attempt to prove that the\r\nwriter was given to \"mendacious stuff,\" though they did argue that he\r\nwas wanting in reflection.\r\n\r\nBut it is a well-known fact that grave matters--very grave\r\nmatters--were with sufficient particularity alleged against the Pope,\r\nagainst the Presidents, against the Rules of Procedure, against\r\nthe authorized Press, against the favourites of the Court among\r\nthe bishops, against the secret way in which \"the Council was made\r\nbeforehand,\" and above all against the political designs which were\r\nentertained; and, one must ask, with what single fact of all these is\r\nany manly attempt made to grapple by the Cardinal, or by the bishops\r\nwhom he cites in his support? Besides these facts, of which some were\r\namusing, some absurd, some discreditable, there were others which\r\nfor all good men except Papists, in the proper sense, were seriously\r\nalarming, and these were alleged by Catholic and Liberal Catholic,\r\nby men in opposition and by men in all places of authority up to the\r\nhighest--by Vitelleschi, by Friedrich, by Veuillot, by Guérin, by Frond\r\nand his contributors, by _Ce Qui se Passe au Concile_, by Hefele, by\r\nKenrick, by Darboy, by Rauscher, by Place, by Dupanloup, by the hundred\r\nand thirty bishops who signed the protest against even discussing\r\ninfallibility, by the groups of bishops who signed that against the\r\nRules of Procedure, by those who signed the solemn one against the new\r\nRules, by those who petitioned for the A B C of deliberative freedom,\r\nby the scores who signed the historical petition of April 10, 1870, by\r\nthose who protested against the unfair and arbitrary attempt of July 5,\r\nand by those fifty-five who, the day before the final session, placed\r\nin the hands of the Pope their protest, saying that if they voted in\r\nthe public session they could only repeat, and that with stronger\r\nreasons, their previous vote--that is, of _Non placet_; a protest of\r\nwhich Cardinal Manning has taken a strangely inaccurate and misleading\r\nview. Such facts were alleged by _La Liberté du Concile_, by _La\r\nDernière Heure du Concile_, by Mamiani, by Bonghi, by Beust, by Daru,\r\nby Arnim, by Acton, by Montalembert, by Döllinger; and still more by\r\nthe _Civiltá Cattolica_, the _Stimmen aus Maria Laach_, the _Univers_,\r\nthe _Monde_, and the _Unitá Cattolica_; and most of all were they\r\nembodied in the words and official manifestoes of Pope Pius IX. What\r\none of these alarming or discreditable or equivocal facts is disposed\r\nof by the passages which Cardinal Manning in his need has cited? He\r\ncites Hefele to prove that people who were outside of the Council told\r\nfalsehoods as to what passed inside. But with the wonted sequence of\r\nhis logic, what he proves out of the mouth of Hefele is that people\r\nwho were inside of the Council sold the secret, though in doing so\r\nthey incurred the pains of mortal sin. The proof is quite as apposite\r\nas many of those relied upon by Cardinal Manning, and it is no wonder\r\nthat such a habit of reasoning should have landed him where he is. He\r\ncites of all men Ketteler. Now supposing that Ketteler was the person\r\nto invalidate serious testimony, what particular fact is disproved by\r\nthe passage cited? The only one it affects to touch is the question as\r\nto whether, in substance, the anti-infallibilist doctrine of Döllinger\r\nwas not also that of the majority of the German bishops. That question\r\nis not faced in front. Ketteler only raises a side issue. He denies\r\nthat on some certain occasion, certain bishops had in a certain way\r\nmade a statement to that effect. Cardinal Manning has not lived so long\r\nin Rome, and learned so much there, without knowing something of the\r\nvalue of such contradictions. But if he means--as, however reluctantly,\r\none must take him to mean--to use Ketteler to prove to Englishmen that\r\nthe majority of the German bishops were not, before July 1870, opposed\r\nto that as a doctrine which is now a dogma of their creed, then let\r\nKetteler by all means stand on one side, but pamphlets, memoranda,\r\nspeeches, petitions, votes, protests stand on the other. Ketteler\r\nis cited against Döllinger, and agreeably to the all but infallible\r\nfelicity of the Cardinal's logic, about the most definite thing\r\nKetteler says against the Provost is that _Janus_, for falsification\r\nof history, can hardly be compared to anything but the Provincial\r\nLetters of Pascal. Had the Cardinal cited the whole body of the German\r\nbishops, he might, indeed, with English Catholics have gained some show\r\nof authority; but how would it have been with the fellow-countrymen of\r\nthose prelates? or with any who, like their fellow-countrymen, had,\r\nin the two Fulda manifestoes of 1869 and 1870, and in other words\r\nand deeds of those mitred diplomatists--words and deeds which cannot\r\nbe erased--learned at what rate to prize statements signed by their\r\nepiscopal crosses? There are in Europe few bodies of functionaries\r\nwho stood in sorer need than did these German bishops of something\r\nto rehabilitate the credit of their Yea and Nay; not that even yet\r\nit seems to have fallen quite so low as that of their superiors of\r\nthe Curia; at least, not quite so low in matters of purely personal\r\nreputation, when no official obligation exists to make a public\r\nimpression which is contrary to the facts, and when dissimulation,\r\nif practised, arises from a habit partly professional, partly\r\npersonal, and one sometimes indulged in as an exercise of cleverness.\r\nCardinals hardly do prudently to raise on English soil questions about\r\ntruthfulness; for the English public will not much longer be content\r\nto take information at haphazard or at second-hand, but will go to the\r\nfountains, and learn about things in Rome as things in Rome in reality\r\nhave been.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Theiner, _Acta Genuina_, i. 686.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF WORKS QUOTED OR REFERRED TO AS AUTHORITIES\r\n\r\n\r\n_The titles and editions being here given, the references in each\r\nparticular instance will be no longer than is sufficient to identify\r\nthe work._\r\n\r\nSome works cited only once are not here entered, their titles being\r\ngiven at full in the body of the book.

That body consists of some\r\neighteen or twenty cardinals, with a few prelates and a number of\r\nconsulters. It holds a prominent place among the congregations, or\r\nboards as they would be called at our Court, which, taken collectively,\r\nmay be said to constitute the Roman Curia. It determines not only\r\nquestions touching the canonization of saints, and the patron saints\r\nof towns and countries, but also questions touching relics, rubrics,\r\nand the title of sacred images to worship. The all-important matters of\r\nrobes, adornments, and precedence, are said by different authorities to\r\nbe regulated by it, and by the smaller Congregation of Ceremonies. The\r\npontifical masters of the ceremonies have a seat at both boards.\r\n\r\nThe day in question fell within three months after the signing of\r\nthe convention of September, by which the new kingdom of Italy had\r\nsucceeded in binding Napoleon III to withdraw his troops from the\r\nPapal States, at the close of 1866. It was, therefore, at a moment\r\nwhen thoughts were forcibly directed to the contingencies which might\r\narise to the Papacy should it be left alone with Italians. It was,\r\nmoreover, only two days before the occurrence of an incident which has\r\nalready grown into an event, and was designed to mark a new era in\r\nsociety at large. To that era the proceedings of the six years which we\r\nare about to trace were to form the introductory stage, up to a grand\r\ninauguration both legislative and ceremonial.\r\n\r\nWe have no information as to the business for which the meeting we\r\nspeak of had been convened. It was, however, opened as usual by the\r\nreading of a prayer. After the prayer, the Pontiff commanded all who\r\nwere not members of the Sacred College to withdraw, and leave him alone\r\nwith the Cardinals. The excluded dignitaries interchanged conjectures\r\nas to what might be the cause of this unusual proceeding, and hoped\r\nthat on their readmission they should be informed. But the Pope did not\r\ncondescend to their curiosity; they found that the Congregation only\r\nwent on with the regular business, and when events cleared up the doubt\r\nit proved that not one of them had guessed the truth.\r\n\r\nIn the short but eventful interval, Pius IX had formally communicated\r\nto the Cardinals his own persuasion, long cherished, and now quickened\r\nto the point of irrepressible action, that the remedy for the evils of\r\nthe time would be found only in a General Council. He commanded them to\r\nstudy the expediency of convoking one, and to send to him in writing\r\ntheir opinions upon that question.\r\n\r\nThe above incident is the first related in the sumptuous volume of\r\nCecconi, written by command of the Pope, who, after it appeared,\r\nconferred on the author the archbishopric of Florence. That volume\r\nexclusively narrates the secret proceedings of the five years which\r\nintervened between this meeting and the opening of the Vatican\r\nCouncil. But, while telling us what took place on December 6, the\r\nCourt historian passes in dead silence over the eighth. On that day,\r\nhowever, the Vatican launched manifestoes which had been for years\r\nin preparation, and which have been mentioned every day since. These\r\nsummed up all the past policy of Pius IX, and formed a basis for the\r\nfuture government of the world. They furnished to the Vatican Council,\r\nstill five years distant, the kernel of its decrees, both those passed\r\nand those only presented. They are, in fact, printed with the Freiburg\r\nedition of its _Acta_ as preparatory documents.\r\n\r\nDecember is to Pius IX, as it is to the Bonapartes, a month of solemn\r\nanniversaries. On the eighth of that month, ten years previously to the\r\ntime of which we are writing, surrounded by two hundred bishops, he\r\nproclaimed the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary as a doctrine\r\nof the Church. In his own imagination, this act formed an epoch of\r\nglory, to the lustre of which three distinct triumphs contributed.\r\nIn the first place, a darling bye-belief was lifted from the humble\r\nposture of pious opinion, to that of a dogma binding on all, who must\r\nadmit changes into their creed with every change of Rome. In the\r\nsecond place, a new and mighty advance in the power of the Papacy was\r\nachieved, for a formal addition to the creed was made without the\r\nsanction of a General Council. Those bishops who attended manifestly\r\nacted, not as members of a co-ordinate branch of a legislature, but as\r\ncouncillors of an autocrat. The absent were placed under the necessity\r\nof accepting the _fait accompli_, or of attempting to undo it in the\r\nface of the Pontiff, the Curia, and the majority of the prelates.\r\n\"Gallicanism,\" said the _Civiltá Cattolica_, \"was, in fact, bruised\r\nunder the heel of the Immaculate, when Pius IX., by his own authority,\r\nlaid down the definition.\"[5] Thirdly, an impression of the personal\r\ninspiration of Pius IX was conveyed, with embellishments, so as to\r\nprepare the way for the recognition of his infallibility.\r\n\r\nWhen he was in the act of proclaiming the new dogma, the beams of\r\nthe sun streamed gloriously upon him; the fact being that his throne\r\nwas so fixed that this must take place if the sun shone at the time.\r\nNevertheless, the visible rays were hailed as evidence of the light\r\nwhich makes manifest things not seen. The Pope sought, in the great\r\nfresco of Podesti, to popularize and perpetuate his own conception\r\nof this event, which is called, in French guide-books to the Vatican,\r\nthe _coup de soleil historique_. That picture, filling an entire side\r\nof a chamber, near to the renowned frescoes of Raffaele, represents\r\nthe Virgin looking down from celestial glory upon Pius IX, and, by the\r\nhand of an angel, who holds a cross, pouring a stream of supernal light\r\non his enraptured eye. Hence may the faithful gather that this is the\r\nlight by which he reveals the truth to men.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Serie VII, viii. p. 668.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe Encyclical _Quanta Cura_, December 8, 1864--Causes of Ruin of\r\nModern Society: rejection of the \"force\" of the Church--Religious\r\nEquality--Pretensions of Civil Law and of Parents to Control\r\nEducation--Laws of Mortmain--Remedies--Restoration of the\r\nAuthority of the Church--Connecting Links between Encyclical and\r\nSyllabus--Retrospect of Evidences that all Society was in Ruins--The\r\nMovement for Reconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tenth anniversary of the auspicious day of \"The Immaculate\"\r\nbeing now at hand, Pius IX had, as we have seen, chosen its fore-eve\r\nfor setting in motion the preparations for his General Council. He\r\nreserved for the day itself the great deed of publishing the Encyclical\r\n_Quanta Cura_ and its accompanying Syllabus of Errors. It is said\r\nthat the inception of those documents dates back to a point not very\r\nlong subsequent to the proclamation of the Immaculate Conception, and\r\nthat the first Special Congregation named to prepare them spent more\r\nthan five years without agreeing, after which it was dissolved by his\r\nHoliness, and a second named, which completed the task.\r\n\r\nThe keynote of the Encyclical is that of an alarm, in the martial\r\nsense; not a panic cry, accompanied by a throwing away of arms, but a\r\nnote of danger, with a call to take them up.\r\n\r\nThe cause assigned for alarm is the ruinous condition of society--that\r\nword being used in its political, not its domestic sense. The very\r\nbases of society were shaken by evil principles, which had spread on\r\nall sides and raised a \"horrible tempest.\" Before proceeding to the\r\nerrors to be now condemned, the Pontiff is careful to connect with them\r\nthose other \"principal errors of our sad times\" which he had already\r\ncondemned in previous encyclicals, allocutions, and letters apostolic.\r\nHe thus lays the logical foundation for the collection of them in the\r\nSyllabus. He first reminds the bishops how he had stirred them up to\r\nwar against these errors, and how he had also commanded the children\r\nof the Church to abhor and shun them. Secondly, he enumerates certain\r\nadditional errors, condemns them in turn, and commands his sons to\r\nshun them likewise. Condemnations pronounced in this formal manner are\r\njudicial and sovereign. The Pontiff does not speak as a mere teacher,\r\nbut as the supreme tribunal of the Church. The judgments pronounced are\r\nnot for the guidance of individuals merely, but are a rule for every\r\nofficer of the Church. Every such sentence fixes the state of the law.\r\n\r\nAfter many generalities, the first token of ruin in modern society\r\nparticularized is the design manifested to check and set aside the\r\nsalutary _force_[6] which ought always to be exercised by the Church,\r\nnot only over individuals, but also over nations, both \"peoples\"\r\nand sovereigns. The second token of ruin is the prevalence of the\r\nerror that the State may treat various religions on a footing of\r\nequality--the error that liberty of worship is in fact a personal\r\nright of every man, and that the citizen is entitled to make a free\r\nprofession of his belief, orally or by the press, without fear of\r\neither civil or ecclesiastical power. This is condemned as being the\r\n\"liberty of damnation.\" The next token of ruin is hostility to the\r\nreligious orders, which were established by their founders only by\r\nthe inspiration of God. Another token of ruin is the belief that all\r\nthe rights of parents over their children arise out of civil law,\r\nespecially the claim to control their education. The Pope would seem to\r\nthink that this notion is the ground for denying the right of priests\r\nto take the control of education out of the hand of parents, or the\r\nground for claiming the protection of civil law for the natural and\r\nScriptural right of the parent against the alleged right of the priest.\r\nSuch denial of the right of the priest is dilated upon as a further\r\ntoken of ruin. The existence of laws of mortmain is an additional\r\ntoken. After these civil and ecclesiastical matters, one theological\r\npoint is adduced, with formal yet fervent language, as if it were some\r\nnew plague, broken out in our own times--the denial of the divinity of\r\nour blessed Lord. This seems to be the only question in theology proper\r\ndirectly raised in the document. The errors now signalized are all\r\ncondemned, and formally added to those previously condemned.\r\n\r\nJust as the Emperor Nicholas of Russia, before undertaking the campaign\r\nthat led to the Crimean war, found his sick man and pointed out his\r\nsymptoms, so had Pius IX done. In the former case, the sick man was\r\nonly one wide-spread but despotic empire. In the latter, it included\r\neverything that could be called, in the dialect of the Vatican, the\r\nModern State.\r\n\r\nProceeding from his enumeration of the evils which mark the ruin of\r\ncontemporary society to the remedies by which it is to be repaired, his\r\nHoliness once more wraps up much of what he may mean in generalities.\r\nWhen he does come to particulars, the hierarchy are directed to teach\r\nthat kingdoms rest on the foundations of the faith; that kingly power\r\nis bestowed, not only for the government of the world, but still more\r\nfor the protection of the Church; that nothing can be more glorious\r\nfor rulers than to permit the Catholic Church to govern according to\r\nher own laws (i.e. canon law), not allowing any one to impede her free\r\naction, and not setting the regal will above that of the priests of\r\nChrist. Here is touched the great question in government. The Modern\r\nState had not only emancipated the throne from the supreme tribunal\r\nof the Church, that is, the Pope, but it had also emancipated the\r\ncivil courts from the external tribunal of the Church, that is, the\r\necclesiastical court. The latter as well as the former evil must be\r\nredressed. To such prescriptions for the healing of society is added a\r\nproclamation of indulgences, and then follows an exhortation to pray\r\nboth to God and to the Blessed Virgin, \"who has destroyed all heresies\r\nthroughout the world\"--whatever that may mean in history, theology, or\r\nrhetoric. \"She is gentle and full of mercy; ... and standing at the\r\nright hand of her only Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, as queen, in gilded\r\nclothing, surrounded with variety, there is nothing which she cannot\r\nobtain from Him.\"\r\n\r\nThis curious document was a necessary introduction to the Syllabus.\r\nThe external connecting link between the two was formed by a covering\r\nletter of Cardinal Antonelli conveying the Syllabus to the hierarchy by\r\ndirect command of the Pope, \"that they might have all the errors and\r\nthe pernicious doctrines which have been condemned by him under their\r\neyes.\"[7] The internal link lay in the title of the Syllabus, which\r\nrecited the language of the Encyclical referring to the antecedent\r\njudgments of the Pontiff. It is not a syllabus of errors _in general_,\r\nnor of errors merely disapproved and abhorred by Pius IX in particular,\r\nnor of errors rebuked and denounced by him only in sermons, speeches,\r\nor briefs; but a syllabus of _The Principal Errors of our Times, set\r\nforth by him in Consistorial Allocutions, Encyclicals, and other\r\nLetters Apostolic_.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to consider the Syllabus as the new foundation laid\r\nfor the reconstruction of society after its ruin, we may for a moment\r\nglance at the facts which might seem to prove to observers, looking\r\nfrom the Vatican, that it had been reduced to a ruinous condition.\r\n\r\nComing to the throne in 1846, Pius IX inherited the sovereignty of\r\nStates which had long been in a condition of chronic disaffection.\r\nThe state of things is described as follows by Monsignor Liverani, a\r\nlearned but seemingly disappointed prelate, who wrote hoping to redeem\r\nthe glory of the Papacy by the re-establishment of a Holy Roman Empire\r\nwith an Italian head, after the example of that interval between\r\nthe line of Charlemagne and that of Otho, when Guido of Spoleto,\r\nhis brilliant son Lambert, and Berengarius wore the imperial title.\r\n\"The people,\" says Liverani, \"have spoken for forty years, groaning,\r\nagitating, shaking off the yoke by frequent revolutions, accompanied by\r\ncrimes and continuous misfortunes, by slaughters, wars, bombardments,\r\nbanishments, and desolations.\"[8]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, prelates from the north, coming to pay their homage to\r\nthe new Pontiff, on reaching the last spurs of the Alps, might embrace\r\nin the glance of their mind all thence to Ætna, and say, Happy land!\r\nthe throne of his Holiness in the centre, the faithful Bourbon on the\r\nsouth, the Hapsburg on the north, with Tuscany under a branch of the\r\nHapsburgs, and Piedmont under the House of Savoy--what a spectacle of\r\nCatholic power! Holy land! not a heretic temple; not one teacher but in\r\ncommunion with Peter: blessed scene of Catholic unity!\r\n\r\nA poor representative of the oft-extirpated Waldenses might say in\r\nsilence--for such words durst not then disturb the Catholic unity of\r\nItalian air--You forget a few teachers in the valleys behind you, who\r\nnever left the word of God to turn lords either of the earth or of the\r\nfaith. Before you there is not a pulpit with the Bible, nor a man who\r\never drinks the cup of Christ, excepting priests alone; not a temple\r\nwith God's commandments on its walls, but many a decalogue altered by\r\nthe authority of a man who, making the law of God reformable, claims\r\nthat his own shall be irreformable!\r\n\r\nBeyond the limits of the Pope's temporal dominions soon arose\r\ncommotions which spread over the principal seats of his spiritual\r\npower. In Switzerland the Jesuits provoked the war of the Sonderbund,\r\nand were foiled. Beyond the Atlantic a considerable portion of Mexico\r\npassed into the hands of the Protestant United States. Portugal was\r\nplagued with revolt. A famine thinned and dispersed the Roman Catholic\r\npopulation of Ireland. France drove away her good king. The Emperor of\r\nAustria was compelled to abdicate, and the empire was not saved from\r\ndismemberment without aid from Russia. The King of Bavaria also had to\r\nlay down his crown. The sovereigns of Tuscany and Naples were compelled\r\nto fly; as was, alas! the Pontiff himself. Spain and her Queen were\r\nseldom heard of, except for an insurrection or a scandal. Only two\r\nRoman Catholic countries were thriving--Belgium, with a Protestant\r\nking, and a constitution which the Church had solemnly and vehemently\r\ncondemned; and Piedmont, which, worse than Hannibal, had opened the\r\npasses of the Alps to religious liberty.\r\n\r\nThis was the first sweep of the hurricane. During its prevalence, those\r\nportions of the world which lay without the Papal circle enjoyed as\r\nmuch rest as was to be looked for beside such troubled waters. Both\r\nschismatical Russia and heretical England were stable and expanding.\r\nPrussia was for a time seriously disturbed, but, nevertheless, was\r\nmanifestly advancing to the first place in Germany. Holland, Denmark,\r\nand Sweden held on their way; and the United States were growing apace.\r\n\r\nFrom his exile the Pope called on the Catholic powers for armed aid.\r\nAustria crushed and held the Emilia. Spain took Fuimicino and the\r\ncities on the Tyrrhenian shore. Naples conquered Frosinone and the\r\nsouth up to Palestrina, but was driven back at Velletri by Garibaldi.\r\nFinally, France declared herself ready to terminate the war; and, after\r\nfailing for weeks before the slight defences of Rome, ultimately took\r\nthe city.[9]\r\n\r\nIndebted for a welcome restoration to the unwelcome hand of a\r\nBonaparte, Pius IX, on re-entering his States, found himself\r\npermanently dependent for possession of the capital on the sword of\r\nFrance, and for that of the provinces on the sword of Austria. Under\r\ntheir protection he enjoyed some years of struggling sovereignty. This\r\ncould hardly be called a restoration of the temporal power, for a power\r\nis not really restored till it can again stand alone. Instead of being\r\nan opponent of the Jesuits, a Liberal, and a Reformer, as he had been,\r\nthe Pope was now transformed into a violent reactionary, and had fallen\r\nentirely under the influence of the Jesuits. His admirers proudly point\r\nto his acts from that time forward as evidence that they have been\r\nuniformly aimed at one end. That end, viewed on its negative side,\r\nthey call combating the Revolution, and, viewed on its positive side,\r\nthe reconstruction of society. In the introduction to his Speeches,\r\nhis peculiar mission is said to be that of reconstruction. This\r\nreconstruction was to begin with the restoration of ideas, and was to\r\nproceed to the restoration of facts.\r\n\r\nIt is this movement that we are about to trace. First, we shall take\r\na brief retrospect from the time of its inception at Gaeta up to the\r\nappearance of the Syllabus, which, as the ostensible ground-plan of\r\na cosmopolitan code, was meant to be the charter of reconstruction.\r\nWe shall then, from that stage onward, as far as our materials enable\r\nus, detail the progressive steps of the movement up to the end of\r\nthe Vatican Council, which was meant to complete the constituent\r\narrangements of the new theocratic monarchy. We shall see unfolding a\r\nmovement for dominion as distinctive as was that of Leo III when he\r\nlinked the fortunes of the Papacy to those of a new Western Empire;\r\nas distinctive as was the movement of Hildebrand when from political\r\ndependence he lifted up the Papacy to unheard-of domination; as\r\ndistinctive as was the movement of the Popes after the Reformation,\r\nwhen through war and the Inquisition they restored in several countries\r\nof Europe their spiritual ascendancy. We shall witness the rise of a\r\ncurious and powerful literature--scholastic, serial, and popular--which\r\nhas steadily swollen in volume, and now acts with ever accelerating\r\nforce on the religious antipathies of many nations, pointing to future\r\nwars on a scale unheard of, fixing the aim of those wars, and hinting\r\nat the disappearance of all existing institutions but the Church.\r\nWe shall see a well-sustained endeavour, in the name of freedom of\r\ninstruction, to take all schools and universities out of the hands of\r\nparents and of States, and to put them into the hands of priests. We\r\nshall see such rights in matters ecclesiastical as in the Church of\r\nRome had still survived to the laity, the priests, and the bishops,\r\ngradually suppressed in action till the way was prepared for their\r\nabolition in law. We shall see the subordination of the civil law\r\nto the canon law, and the subjection of the civil magistrate to the\r\n\"ecclesiastical magistrate\" insisted upon as the essence of social\r\norder. We shall see all the inherited rights of kings and rulers,\r\nwithin their own dominions, to put limits upon the action of the Pope\r\nof Rome, first impugned, then contested, then defied, and finally,\r\nas far as the Church could do it, legislated out of existence. We\r\nshall see all kings and rulers challenged to accept the Pontiff as\r\ntheir head, and even as their judge in all matters involving moral\r\nresponsibility. We shall find it taught and taught again that all\r\nCatholic countries have two rulers--the universal and the national one,\r\nthe universal one superior, the national one subordinate; and that\r\nevery citizen of those countries is more the subject of the Pope than\r\nof his prince. We shall see the relation between the civil and the\r\necclesiastical authorities as existing within the Papal States solemnly\r\nand repeatedly declared to be the normal relation of those two orders\r\nof authority, and to be the only example of their proper relative\r\nposition extant in all the earth. We shall see the Papal States\r\nearnestly held up as the model for the new theocracy in the entire\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nFurther, we shall see, for five successive years, secret proceedings\r\nof the Court of Rome sufficiently laid open by official divulgence\r\nto enable us to note the slow, sure steps devised for depriving\r\nkings of all their rights in self-defence against the Pope; for\r\ndepriving bishops of all their powers of checking or restraining the\r\nPope; for depriving theologians of any voice in the councils of the\r\nChurch; and for depriving the parochial clergy of their individual\r\nand collective franchises. We shall at almost every turn hear modern\r\nlaws and constitutions--liberty of worship, liberty of the press,\r\nliberty of meeting, with representative legislatures and responsible\r\ngovernments--denounced as the curse of mankind in all the varying\r\naccents of a strange dialect, or a dialect happily strange to us. We\r\nshall witness the preaching of a new crusade, on a cosmopolitan scale,\r\nwith considerable art, making the bearing of arms for St. Peter to\r\nappear, pre-eminently, the life of the Cross, and dying in arms for\r\nSt. Peter to appear as the martyr's end, the fairest of deaths, and\r\nthe most enviable. We shall see how the most jealous and obstinate\r\noligarchy in the world were led on from step to step of subjugation\r\ntill they were made the instruments of reducing their collective body,\r\nwhen in Council assembled, from a co-ordinate branch of a legislature\r\nto a mere privy council to the Bishop of Rome, and of reducing the\r\nmembers of their body, when dispersed, from the position of real\r\ndiocesan bishops to that of prefects of the Bishop of Rome.\r\n\r\nStill further, we shall see evolved under our eyes the process\r\nby which opinions are elevated into doctrines, and doctrines are\r\nerected into irreformable dogma. We shall see how the bishops, while\r\ndispersed, were induced, in order to facilitate the making of a new\r\ndogma, to discredit their acknowledged standard of belief, tradition,\r\nsubstituting for it the general consent of the Church; and how, when\r\nthe passing of the dogma was secured, the assembled bishops were\r\ninduced to disavow the consent of the Church as unnecessary. We shall\r\nsee ecclesiastical magnates prostrate and petitioning the Bishop of\r\nRome for the elementary liberties of a legislature, and petitioning in\r\nvain. We shall see how such magnates in secret petitions represented\r\nthe principles about to be erected into dogma as contrary to their\r\ntraditional belief and constant teaching, as fraught with peril to the\r\nState, and as certain to bring discredit on the loyalty of any sincere\r\nbeliever in such dogma; and how the same magnates afterwards in public\r\ndocuments affirmed the opposite in all these respects. We shall see how\r\nrenowned champions of the Papacy complained late in life that they had\r\nbeen used for its glory and deceived as to its principles. Finally, we\r\nshall see set in motion an immense apparatus of means for effecting, in\r\na course of ages, the complete social, political, and ecclesiastical\r\nreconstruction of all society, which reconstruction will culminate only\r\nwhen the spiritual and the temporal powers meeting as in an apex in\r\nthe Vicar of Christ, he shall be by all men regarded as not only High\r\nPriest, but as King of kings and Lord of lords; when, all authority and\r\ndominion, all principality and power, being put under him, there shall\r\nin the whole earth exist only, as we should express it, one master and\r\nall men slaves, or, as he would express it, one fold and one shepherd.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The word is _vis_, which both the _Civiltá Cattolica_\r\nand the French _Recueil_ translate by \"force.\" But not so the German\r\n_Stimmen aus Maria Laach_, which makes it \"influence\"--_einfluss_ (Heft\r\ni. p. 10).

His\r\ndescription of himself at the same time was \"being counted worthy to\r\nsuffer shame for the name of Jesus, and being made in some measure\r\nconformable to His passion\" (Id. p. 234).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nFoundation of a Literature of Reconstruction, Serial and\r\nScholastic--The _Civiltá Cattolica_: its Views on Education and\r\non Church and State--Tarquini's Political Principles of Pope and\r\nKing--Measures Preparatory to the Syllabus.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the year 1850 was commenced a magazine, at the instance of\r\nthe Jesuits, and under their direction, bearing the title Catholic\r\nCivilization (_Civiltá Cattolica_), in opposition to modern\r\ncivilization. We may here say that the daily organ of the same\r\ncomplexion bears the title of Catholic Unity (_Unitá Cattolica_), in\r\nopposition to Italian unity. Above one hundred volumes of the _Civiltá_\r\nhave been published; and it must ever be named in connexion with\r\nPius IX as the intimate organ of his policy, and the most complete\r\nstore of his published records. Perhaps its place in the history of\r\nliterature is unique. Considering the number of books, serials, and\r\njournals, in different languages, of which it is the inspiring force,\r\nand considering the modifications it has already succeeded in bringing\r\nabout in the ideas and even in the organization of the whole Catholic\r\nsociety, they can scarcely be charged with vain boasting who call it\r\nthe most influential organ in the world. The Jesuit Fathers forming its\r\neditorial staff reside close to the Pope's palace, and work under his\r\nimmediate direction. Dr. Friedrich, during the Vatican Council, told\r\nsome bishops that if they would understand the Council, they must study\r\nit with the _Civiltá_ in their hands. For our part, before reading that\r\nremark we had applied the same principle to the entire movement.\r\n\r\nThe leading idea of the _Civiltá_ is expressed, says the article\r\non the programme, in its title. _Catholic Civilization_ is flag,\r\ndevice, and profession of faith.[10] The substance is civilization,\r\nthe quality Catholic. Civilization is not polish, but organization\r\nin community, under rule. Civilization, after the Catholic ideal,\r\nhad continued steadily to grow up to the fifteenth century, but was\r\nbroken in the sixteenth by Lutheranism; was again enfeebled in the\r\nseventeenth by Jansenism; yet again was it undermined in the eighteenth\r\nby Voltairianism, and now in the nineteenth it is lacerated by\r\nSocialism. The evil has actually entered Italy, and even heterodoxy\r\nitself threatens to invade the Peninsula. Heresy is, in fact, likely\r\nto become connected with that aspiration after national unity by which\r\nthe people are misled. _Almost everything having been overhauled in\r\nheterodox spirit, almost everything must be reconstituted from the\r\nfoundation._[11] These words express the mission of the new periodical,\r\nand of the restored Papacy. They are the original announcement of a\r\npolicy ever since pursued without flagging.\r\n\r\nTo reconstitute society according to the Catholic ideal is the single\r\nobject set forth. \"On the brink of social dissolution,\" the one\r\nnecessity felt, pressed, reiterated, is that of re-establishing on the\r\nCatholic ideal the notion of civilization--that is of the civil system;\r\nand of leading back the movement of civilization to that Catholic ideal\r\nfrom which it had been departing for three centuries.[12]\r\n\r\nThe essential point in this fabric is \"the idea of authority.\" But\r\nthe idea of authority cannot be restored except by quickening it, and\r\nreinforcing it by the Catholic conception. When the divine authority\r\nwas shaken, men would no longer hear of the human (i.e. when the Papacy\r\nwas rejected, civil government fell into contempt). The Catholic\r\nideal is idly reproached with absolutism. But, among Catholics,\r\npure monarchy, if not limited by certain conventional checks, is\r\ntempered by a higher law, not abstract, but practical, active, and\r\noperative. Absolutism in the sense of despotism is the creation of\r\nProtestantism and Voltairianism, and if it may sit on the throne of\r\na king, it is more frequently found in constitutional chambers or\r\ndemocratic assemblies.[13] Therefore the one sufficing remedy is the\r\nrestoration in ruler and subject of the notion of authority according\r\nto the Catholic ideal. For this the new organ calls for _a salutary\r\nconspiracy, a holy crusade_;[14] two phrases that mean all that has\r\nsince taken place, and all that has yet to come.\r\n\r\nThe very first article of the _Civiltá_, after that upon the programme,\r\nis on education: \"the question which holds all the future destinies of\r\nthe European nations struggling within its ballot-boxes.\" With this\r\nappreciation of its theme, it takes ground which has since become\r\nfamiliar to Europe, and enunciates principles which have now frequently\r\nbeen reproduced in our own discussions; so that a slight sketch of its\r\nreasoning will not be without interest to English readers. The interest\r\nis increased by the fact that its aims have steadily gained ground in\r\nFrance. In England, some of them, if not recognized as principles, have\r\nbeen, to a considerable extent, practically embodied, as undetected\r\nprinciples are apt to be.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the theme of Freedom of Instruction, it denounces\r\nthe tyranny and monopoly of the University of France. Had not the\r\nspirit of Catholicism, it says, broken the chain, it would soon have\r\nbecome unlawful for one man to tell another the right road, unless\r\nhe had a bachelor's degree, for doing so was a sort of instruction.\r\nThe line properly limiting freedom of instruction it finds in the\r\nline which divides the truth from falsehood. They who demand liberty\r\nof instruction do so in order to teach the truth. But in excluding\r\nthe teaching of lies, it may be even \"necessary to protect children\r\nbetrayed by the barbarous apathy of their parents.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer then asks, But who is to determine what is the lie?\r\nGovernments? \"Until a government can show itself infallible, it must\r\nrenounce all pretensions to regulate instruction and opinion.\" The\r\npretension on its part to do so is tyrannical, because interference\r\nhere is trespassing on the sanctuary, where the truth alone bears rule.\r\n\r\nThe position that it belongs to a government to fix the limits\r\nof freedom of opinion is denounced as having originated in the\r\nReformation, as being Protestant, and, further, as being destitute\r\nof foundation. The Church is the moderator of instruction, precisely\r\nbecause she is the infallible moderator of opinions in all that relates\r\nto the moral order. Consequently there is in existence a competent,\r\neffectual, and revered tribunal. Then follow taunts at journals which\r\ncomplain of communal authorities for giving up their educational rights\r\nto the clergy. These are succeeded by jeers at such statesmen as doubt\r\nif the liberty of communal authorities extends so far as to give them\r\nthe right of surrendering their liberty.\r\n\r\nThe objection is then faced, that liberty may be as justly claimed by\r\nthe non-Catholic as by the Catholic. Of course, replies the _Civiltá_,\r\nthe only case in which that question can become a practical one for\r\nCatholics is where they form the majority. Is it to be supposed that\r\na majority shall be bound, for the sake of a minority \"to pass a law\r\nopening all the pits of hell for its fellow-citizens?... With Catholics\r\nthe liberty of dissidents cannot be a natural right.\"\r\n\r\nThe position taken by statesmen, that the Church is not infallible in\r\npolitics and economy, and that therefore these subjects must be under\r\nthe control of the State, is first laughed at. It reminds the writer of\r\na musketeer who should say to his general, \"I see that your artillery\r\nis of no avail against these Alps; let us open upon them with our\r\nrifles.\" After this comes the principle. The assertion that politics\r\nand economy ought to be under the control of the State rests on one or\r\nother of three errors: (1) Politics and economy do not belong to the\r\nmoral sciences; or, (2) The moral sciences are not subject to moral\r\nlaws; or, (3) The Church is not the authentic exponent of moral law.\r\nThe first of these errors is refuted by every university in Europe, in\r\nall of which politics and economy are classed among the moral sciences.\r\nThe second is a contradiction in terms. The third is a heresy in every\r\nCatholic ear.\r\n\r\nIt will help to a clear understanding of many expressions which must\r\noccur hereafter, if the reader, at this stage, will set before his\r\nmind's eye the scope of the three principles here asserted. Phillips,\r\na modern lay doctor, quoted by the humblest polemic and the mighty\r\n_Civiltá_, in his seven volumes on ecclesiastical law (_Kirchenrecht_),\r\ndiscusses the relations of Church and State at great length. He shows\r\nthat the Church is supreme and the State subordinate, in all things\r\nthat come under the _divine laws_. Holtgreven, a Catholic judge, and an\r\nopponent of the Falk laws, explains this clearly: \"To the divine laws,\r\nin this sense, belong, not only the ten commandments, but also the\r\ncanons of the Church, as the Council of Trent shows. The things subject\r\nto the divine laws include all such worldly things as are _connected_\r\nwith morality.\"[15]\r\n\r\nThis much is conceded by the _Civiltá_, that, if danger to the public\r\ninterests should arise from false teaching of any _material_ science,\r\nthe government may interfere, as it would in a case of adulteration of\r\nfood. The Church is not infallible in material instruction.\r\n\r\nThe article, it will be seen, claims the right to take the teaching of\r\nthe child out of the hand of the parent, and that of the subject out of\r\nthe hand of the State.[16] The latter may mix itself up in the matter\r\nas to material things, not as to moral. Royal supremacy, in university,\r\ncollege, seminary, or primary school, must not be allowed. It has\r\nthe twofold evil of setting the authority and responsibility of the\r\nparent for his child above that of the priest, and of setting the local\r\nauthority of the national ruler above the all-embracing authority of\r\nthe universal one. The State is not only welcome to appear in school,\r\nbut ought to appear in its subordinate capacity, finding money, secular\r\nstatus, and instruction in _material_ things. But in all that part\r\nof schooling which may be called education in the higher sense, of a\r\nfather, a Christian, or a king, the State is not to have a word to say.\r\n\r\nIt would seem difficult to ask a community to do an action involving\r\na more serious disregard of moral considerations than to find money\r\nand power for schools and colleges, and not have a word to say as\r\nto the principles taught in them. We are far from ascribing such a\r\ndisregard of moral considerations to a devout Ultramontane. On the\r\ncontrary, he is persuaded that the State, in committing its money and\r\nauthority to the Church, takes not only the highest human guarantee,\r\nbut a truly divine one, for the protection of every moral interest. The\r\nmotto of the article is a sentence intimating that, all over Europe,\r\nthe question of the future must be the establishment of universities\r\ncanonically instituted.[17]\r\n\r\nIn order to the _restoration of ideas_ now undertaken, as preparing\r\nthe way for the _restoration of facts_, it was a practical necessity\r\nto establish an invariable association between the two ideas of the\r\nonly Judge of true and false, the only Arbiter of right and wrong, and\r\nthe one holy Roman Church. This association could not be established\r\nso well by any arrangement as by making each school an arena on which\r\nevery day the authority of both the parent and the State should be--not\r\npranced upon, not even trampled upon, but serenely and devoutly walked\r\nover, by what M. Veuillot calls the crushing sandals of the monk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother article in the first volume of the _Civiltá_ gives such\r\nexpression to the principles which underlie the whole struggle ever\r\nsince conducted, that some account of it will do more to put the reader\r\nin possession of certain of those principles than formal explanations.\r\nIt is on the central question of the relations of Church and State;\r\nor, as the _Civiltá_ puts it, of the separation of Church and State--a\r\nphrase which, like almost every other, has a different meaning in its\r\npages from what it has with us. The following headings give an idea of\r\nthe drift of the article: \"6. The nation is a part of the Church.\" \"7.\r\nThe part ought to be subordinate to the whole.\" \"8. Because the Church\r\nhas authority.\" \"9. The authority of jurisdiction.\"[18]\r\n\r\n_I believe in the holy Catholic Church_, in the Apostles' Creed, is\r\nthus interpreted: \"I believe that every Catholic individual and nation\r\nforms a part of the Catholic society, and that only by virtue of its\r\nbeing a part does it partake of the benefit of the whole, through being\r\nsubordinated to the laws of the whole.\"\r\n\r\nOn the point of jurisdiction, the writer first unearths \"the\r\nserpent,\" which is the notion that the Church may judge about sins,\r\nvirtues, doctrines, rites, and such-like, but must not touch temporal\r\njurisdiction. This serpent he proceeds to kill. First, he solemnly\r\nappeals to the faith of the reader. \"Do you believe that the Church\r\nis infallible in dogmatic Bulls, at least, unless they are formally\r\nrejected by the episcopate?\" After this, he resorts to pleasantry:\r\n\"Come close to me, and I will tell it in your ear. The Bull of John\r\nXXII condemned John Gianduno and Marsilius of Padua as heretics,\r\nbecause they denied to the Church the right of punishing by corporal\r\npains, and it declared that she could inflict pains even unto\r\ndeath.[19] But I tell you this in secret, solely that you may know what\r\nis the doctrine of the Catholic Church, which you profess--doctrine\r\nput in practice through very many centuries, down to the last Council\r\n(Trent), which fulminated I know not how many penalties, and material\r\nones, even against counts, marquises, princes, and emperors. Woe to\r\nus if they should hear us!\" Thus jauntily did those who had only just\r\nbeen reinstated by foreign arms treat the neo-Catholic doctrine, or,\r\nas it has since been called, the Liberal Catholic one. \"I tell you\r\nplainly,\" adds the writer, \"that if the Church cannot rule her sons,\r\neven in material things, the Church is lost; at least, the Catholic\r\nChurch. She might survive as that invisible Church which was discovered\r\nby Luther among the ruins of the middle ages, and, reconstructed as the\r\n_amphitherium_ and _palæotherium_, were discovered in the geological\r\nstrata, and reconstructed by Cuvier.\"\r\n\r\nAddressing kings, the writer solemnly counsels them to bring forth\r\nall their codes, and pass them under a careful examination. But the\r\nlight by which such examination is to be conducted must be that \"of\r\npure Catholicism, to which all other legislation must be subordinated.\r\nRestore every article of your code, according to the articles of your\r\ncreed, not only in what relates to the duties of subjects, but also in\r\nwhat would seem to diminish the rights of rulers. And that the Catholic\r\ninfluence, which modifies codes, may shine in all its fulness, _let it\r\nnot be ministers or legists, but bishops and the Pontiff, who shall\r\nminutely search into your legislation for every anti-Catholic element_.\"\r\n\r\nThe theocratic Papal polity might have been almost intentionally\r\nframed to contrast with the first principles of the Mosaic theocratic\r\npolity. The latter, put in one word, seems to be this: God as the\r\ngeneral Father is the great right-holder, and He identifies the\r\nrights of every creature with His own, identifying at the same time\r\ntheir welfare with His own glory. Therefore He leaves no creature to\r\nthe care of a Vicar, no province to any departmental divinity. Every\r\nact done for the benefit of our fellow-creatures He reckons as a\r\ntribute to Himself. Every infringement of their rights He treats as an\r\noffence against Himself. Every man was taught to see, not an abstract\r\nprinciple, but a great Father standing beside the gleaning widow, the\r\nsupperless hireling, the pauper forced to pawn, and having no second\r\ncoat--was taught to hear this common Father saying for these to happier\r\nneighbours, \"I am the Lord.\" Every man tempted to lie, cheat, steal,\r\noppress, seduce, or strike, saw the same great Father rising up against\r\nhim, and saying, \"I am the Lord.\"\r\n\r\nIt was of the essence of this theocracy that all who held authority\r\ndid so by and under a written law in the vulgar tongue. Of this law\r\nevery father in his own house was made the guardian, and in it he was\r\nthe responsible instructor of his children. Every prophet professing\r\nthat he bore a fresh message was to be brought to the test of this\r\nwritten law. Those who were to apply the test were the men of the\r\nwhole community. Every one who claimed to bear a special commission\r\nwas bound first to conform to the law, and secondly, to show signs of\r\nspecial divine power. It was a theocracy of direct divine government,\r\nnot of government by a Vicar; a theocracy of written law, not of\r\narbitrary will styling itself authority; a theocracy of private\r\njudgment, not of a veda shut up from the low caste, to be read and\r\ninterpreted only by the twice-born Brahman. Finally, it was a theocracy\r\nin which whatever came from God became its own witness by benefits to\r\nGod's children not to be mistaken, and obvious to all.\r\n\r\nThe statement made in the _Civiltá_ as to the guidance under which\r\nthe reactionary policy in Austria was devised, gives light upon the\r\nduties then engrossing nuncios and confessors at the various Courts\r\nwhere Papal influence was powerful. All that appeared to the world\r\nwas, that at every one of those Courts a cold current of reaction set\r\nin and ran strong. The Jesuits took it for a tide, and the bark of\r\nSt. Peter was to sail cheerily over all the shoals. But the Liberal\r\nCatholics were proportionably disquieted as to the prospects of the\r\nChurch. The first days of Pius IX had fired them with hope that Rome\r\nmight yet be fit to face three things of which she was shy--the Bible,\r\nHistory, and Freedom. But the advent of the Jesuits to power caused\r\nserious forebodings, which soon began to be realized. To quote the\r\nmemorable words of Montalembert, \"Who could have thought that the\r\nclergy, after crying out for liberty in Belgium, would turn round as\r\nthey did in 1852, till we found them beating down all our liberties and\r\nprivileges--in fact, all our ideas--as held in times preceding Napoleon\r\nIII?\"[20]\r\n\r\nWe now find that at the time when the Pontiff was using his clergy to\r\nhelp kings in taking away constitutional rights from their subjects, he\r\nwas himself preparing to take from the kings what they indeed looked\r\nupon as rights, but what he regarded in the light of constitutional\r\nconcessions, infringing the higher rights of their divinely appointed\r\nsuzerain. When the Italian government took possession of the _Collegio\r\nRomano_, it was found that the Jesuits had left in the great library\r\nof the establishment little belonging to the present pontificate. One\r\npamphlet is of some significance. A manuscript note on the title-page\r\nproudly tells how his Holiness wished to have it circulated as widely\r\nas possible. It also adds that on February 1, 1853, when the fathers\r\nof the _Collegio Romano_ stood before his Holiness, he singled out the\r\nauthor, Father Camillo Tarquini, in presence of the other Jesuits and\r\nof the Court, and addressed him thus: \"Father Tarquini, I am delighted;\r\nbravo! well done! I confirm it, and confirm it with all my heart.\"[21]\r\nThis was an early foretoken of the purple in which Tarquini died. He is\r\nthe writer to whom Cardinal Manning appeals, as softening the doctrine\r\nof Bellarmine and Suarez to a temper fitter for our times. The pamphlet\r\nsignalized by this display of favour aims at proving the wickedness\r\nof kings in subjecting the bulls, briefs, or any acts whatever of the\r\nPope, to a _placet_, _exequatur_, or other form of royal assent, before\r\nrecognizing them as having the force of law in their States. This is\r\none form of the error of regalism.\r\n\r\nThe power of the Pontiff, argues Father Tarquini, is this--What he\r\nbinds on earth is bound in heaven. But if the king, stepping in, says,\r\nTo bind implies the force of law, and your acts shall not acquire\r\nthe force of law without my _placet_, how then? Why, the Pontiff\r\nbecomes the one really bound. The king refuses to allow the pontifical\r\njudgments to take effect of themselves. It is not with him \"said on\r\nearth and done in heaven.\" His _placet_ must intervene.\r\n\r\nIt is competent, indeed, he admits to the Pontiff, to _grant_ a right\r\nof _placet_; but such a right, founded on the grace of a Pope, cannot\r\nbe confounded with one inherent in the crown. We quote the following\r\nin full:--\"You say that the _placet_ is a real right, demanded by\r\njustice, and essential to political government. The Church condemns\r\nit by a series of judgments, perhaps without parallel in her history,\r\nextending from her foundation down to Pius IX. She expressly defines\r\nit, with Leo X, Clement VII, Clement XI, and Benedict XIV, as opposed\r\nto all justice, as indecent, absurd, rash, scandalous, as insufferable\r\ndepravity, and worthy of eternal pain. Therefore she punishes it with\r\nthe greatest of penalties, the anathema.\r\n\r\n\"In this matter there is no middle course. You must either lay aside\r\nthe mask of Catholicism, which no longer becomes you, and boldly avow\r\nthat the Church has defined good as evil, justice as injustice, an\r\ninherent right of the crown as an absurdity and a wrong, and done so\r\nin a judgment perpetuated from her foundation to our own day; or you\r\nmust, on the other hand, confess that you are in an error not to be\r\ntolerated.\"\r\n\r\nThus it seems that what with a Christian minister would only be a\r\nclaim to announce the belief and the moral precepts which he found in\r\nthe Holy Scriptures, becomes with the Roman Pontiff a claim to put\r\nhis decree on any matter which he deems conducive to the good of \"the\r\nChurch\" into the form of law, and to set it up without, or in spite\r\nof, but anyhow above, the national law, be it republican, royal, or\r\nimperial. This boundless pretension--for boundless it is--will often be\r\nfound gently expressed as the right of the Pontiff _to communicate with\r\nthe faithful_.\r\n\r\nThe writer then asks what, from his point of view, would seem to be a\r\nnatural question. Would kings like the Pope to demand that his _placet_\r\nshould be required before their laws came into force?[22] He replies\r\nthat some of them have so far unlearned \"Christian doctrine as to say\r\nthat, in case the Pope did so, he would usurp sovereign rights in their\r\nStates.\" But such a proposition is heretical, pronounced to be so by\r\nthe Holy Office in 1654, with the approbation of Innocent X.[23] By\r\nvirtue of this, even our children know that the Church presided over\r\nand governed by the Vicar of Christ is a kingdom which has the ends of\r\nthe earth for its bounds. Therefore it belongs to the Vicar of Christ\r\nto make laws in all parts of the world for her welfare and for her\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nLiberal Catholics trembled for the consequences to Church and State\r\nof Jesuit Court confessors and far-aiming but short-seeing plans.\r\nThey knew that the devout Jesuit calls upon all to regard the Papal\r\ngovernment as the model for the whole world; and that if statesmen\r\nand jurists could be replaced by Jesuits at the various Courts, a\r\ncombination of plan and an unity of action might be secured everywhere\r\nfor a great movement to establish the dominion of Christ in a higher\r\ndegree than the Thirty Years' War did in Austria and Bohemia.\r\n\r\nThere is a point illustrated in this pamphlet which seems to enter into\r\nthe English head more slowly than any other. We mean the conscientious\r\nview of a true Ultramontane as to what constitutes religious liberty,\r\nor violates it. Englishmen sometimes not only transfer their own views\r\non this subject to Ultramontanes, but betray the feeling that they are\r\ngenerous in doing so. It is never generous, or even just, to ascribe\r\nviews to a man which he religiously condemns. If the Englishman will\r\nclearly set before his mind the first postulate of the Ultramontane,\r\nthat God has appointed a vicar upon earth, to whom He has committed\r\nall power, surely he will see that religious liberty must principally\r\nconsist in the freedom of that vicar to do all which he conceives it to\r\nbe in his province to do, and in the freedom of those who receive his\r\ncommands to carry them out, exactly according to his intentions. If any\r\nking or nation limits his freedom to act and command, \"the Pope becomes\r\nthe one really bound.\" The Englishman may say that, on this principle,\r\nno guarantee is left for any liberty but that of the Pontiff, or of\r\nthose who represent authority derived from him. But that is precisely\r\nwhat the Ultramontane does not believe.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, he holds that the highest guarantee for all legitimate\r\nliberty lies in the complete freedom of the Pontiff. No liberty can\r\nbe legitimate that consists in exemption, or assumed exemption, from\r\ndivine authority. And further, the authority of the Vicar of God, being\r\nexercised under unfailing guidance, is not liable to commit violations\r\nof any right.\r\n\r\nWe thus see begun the movement for the restoration of ideas, as\r\npreparatory to the restoration of facts. Ranke has traced the course of\r\nthe \"ecclesiastical restoration,\" which was rendered necessary by the\r\ndamage inflicted on Rome by the Reformation, without being careful to\r\nmark the principles or to track the processes by which \"restoration\"\r\nwas effected in Bohemia, Austria, Spain, Italy, and France. That\r\nrestoration, however, had been real and momentous. A second restoration\r\nhad taken place after the wreck of the French Revolution, when the\r\nPapacy had been smitten by its own sons. It was the pride of the clergy\r\nto cite the fact that the rulers of England and Prussia had co-operated\r\nin that restoration, as proof that the Papal throne was even in\r\nProtestant eyes the central point of order. Now a third restoration was\r\nto be effected--one which would do all that had been left undone by\r\nthe other two. The Pope's throne was not only to be reared up again in\r\nRome, but was to be gradually elevated to a spiritual supremacy equal\r\nto the highest claimed in former Bulls, and to a temporal supremacy as\r\ncomplete as when Hildebrand triumphed at Canossa.\r\n\r\nThe first of these restorations had been fought out with the weapons\r\nof the Inquisition and the war-plots of the Jesuits. The second had\r\nbeen fought out with the weapons of the Liberal Catholics, borrowed\r\nfrom the Reformation and the Modern State. When the Jesuits had pushed,\r\nnot too far, but untimely far, they were for the day disowned; not,\r\nhowever, as inimical to the Church, but as hateful to the nations,\r\nand as, therefore, lowering the credit of the Church with the outside\r\nworld. Now had come the moment when the Liberal Catholics, having done\r\ntheir work, were in turn to be disowned; but on other grounds. They\r\nwere to be cast out as children of the world, infected with principles\r\nsubversive of the \"kingdom of God,\" of that polity in which the priest\r\nof God is the king of men, and the affairs of an erring race are\r\nunerringly guided by consecrated hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _Civiltá_, vol. 1. p. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Ibid. p. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Ibid. p. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Ibid. pp. 20, 21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Ibid. p. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: _Holtgreven_, p. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _Civiltá_, vol. i. pp. 25-51.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Vol. i. p. 647.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Cardinal Tarquini (_Institutiones_, p. 35, ed. 4th),\r\nwhom Cardinal Manning, in his reply to Mr. Gladstone (p. 94), names\r\nas teaching differently on such points from the earlier Jesuits,\r\nBellarmine and Suarez, quotes this case, saying that the Bull in\r\nquestion \"more particularly attributes to the Church that which is the\r\nspecial property of a perfect society, the power of coercion, even to\r\nthe use of material force; but Marsilius, who denied this, was on that\r\naccount condemned as a heretic.\" His words are, \"_Quod maxime proprium\r\nest societatis perfectæ, jus potestatis coactivæ etiam quoad inferendam\r\nvim materialem; Marsilius autem, qui hæc ipsa negabat damnatur eam ob\r\nrem ut hæreticus_.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Letter quoted in _Unitá Cattolica_, March 10, 1870.\r\n_Friedbergh_, p. 120.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: _Del Regio Placet_: Dissertazione del P.

When the reactionary\r\nmovement in politics had attained its full momentum, he called an\r\nassembly of bishops, whose splendour, surrounding his throne, might\r\nrestore to it some of the departed _prestige_. At the same time,\r\nsummoning the bishops for consultation and for ceremonial purposes, but\r\nnot at all for parliamentary ones, would be a secure step of progress\r\nin the absorption of the power of the collective episcopate into the\r\nPapacy. In the midst of two hundred prelates, as we have already seen,\r\nhe proclaimed the Immaculate Conception, in 1854. As a display of\r\nabsolute authority in the highest realm, that of dogma, this act did\r\nmore to advance the proper ideas than an immensity of writing. We have\r\nalready quoted the assertion that it crushed Gallicanism. But ideas\r\nwere only stepping-stones to facts. Professor Michelis asserts that\r\neven during the gathering of 1854 an attempt was made in some large\r\nassembly of bishops to induce them to proclaim Papal infallibility as a\r\nCatholic dogma.[24]\r\n\r\nThe prelates, who, on their way to Rome in 1846, had looked with joy on\r\nthe spectacle of unity, now found that spectacle slightly blemished.\r\nOne heretic temple stood in Turin--a proof that after all the\r\nextirpations of the Waldenses, a root had still lurked in the ground.\r\nThis temple had no images, and had the Bible in mother-tongue. It bore\r\noutside, in words that any cowherd might read, if he could read at all,\r\na verse of Jeremiah: \"Stand ye in the ways and see, and ask for the old\r\npaths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest\r\nfor your souls.\" And this was not only suffered, but done by the House\r\nof Savoy!\r\n\r\nAs the prelates went south, whispers might reach some of them that\r\nin Tuscany the police, now and then, discovered secret bands of\r\nBible-readers, somewhat as in old times the Lollards were unearthed\r\nin England. The historical name of Guicciardini was implicated in the\r\noffence, and a number of vulgar people. Even at Rome, Luigi Desanctis,\r\nparish priest of St. Maria Maddalena, had abandoned as fair prospects\r\nas erudition, character, and favour could well give to an ecclesiastic.\r\nHe had quietly withstood flattering and influential efforts to bring\r\nhim back. First he had sheltered under the British flag; but, finding\r\nthat the flag of Savoy really shed upon Italian soil the all but\r\ninconceivable right of freedom to worship God, he had taken refuge\r\nunder it. He was now devoting his clear, keen, learned pen to teaching\r\nItaly the religion of Christ as he found it in the New Testament. Even\r\nin writing for Italians he found it needful to say that it was only\r\nby living in Rome, and by knowing Pope, Cardinals, and Curia, that\r\nthey could come to a clear understanding of the religion of the city.\r\nThe great cause of this difficulty he found in the three separate\r\ncircles of doctrine in which that religion was wont to be taught, which\r\nhe called (1) the official, (2) the theological, (3) the real.[25]\r\nThe official doctrine was that for use with heretics, the doctrine\r\npresented by Bossuet and Wiseman; the theological doctrine was for use\r\nwith men of culture; the real doctrine was for practical use among the\r\npeople. The eloquent Barnabite, Gavazzi was now thundering against the\r\nPapacy. Nay, even the threshold of the Inquisition had been crossed by\r\nthe force of Protestant unity. A priest, avowing heresy, who once had\r\nheld good preferment, had been seized after the French took the city.\r\nAt the urgent instance of the Evangelical Alliance, General Baraguay\r\nd'Hilliers put on such hard pressure that even in sacred Rome a\r\nrenegade priest walked out of the palace of the Holy Office a ransomed\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe confidence that the Virgin would reward her new exaltation by\r\ncorresponding exaltation of him who had procured it, was often\r\nexpressed in language picturesque and ardent. But scarcely had the\r\nincense of the fresh offering cleared away when premonitory symptoms\r\nappeared of the storm rising again. Meantime, many Catholics became\r\nanxious when they found the Pope's favourite organ treating even such\r\nwriters as Bellarmine, Suarez, and St. Thomas Aquinas, as too much\r\ninclined to Liberalism. Liverani, in referring to articles of this\r\nkind, says that Bellarmine had been \"the author of the Night of St.\r\nBartholomew,\" and he thinks that Italian Catholics in the nineteenth\r\ncentury might be allowed to be Liberals up to the standard of\r\nBellarmine and Suarez.\r\n\r\nIn 1855, Piedmont, sending a force to the Crimea, took her place beside\r\nFrance and England. The next year, at the Congress of Paris, Cavour\r\nlifted up his voice among the representatives of Europe, and protested\r\nagainst foreign occupation in Italy. Mexico abolished the external\r\ntribunal of the Church, the ecclesiastical court; abolished tithes,\r\noffered protection to all of either sex who might choose to forsake\r\ntheir convents, and declared its resolution not to submit its acts to\r\nthe supreme authority of the Apostolic See. Other nations of South\r\nAmerica met the aggressive ecclesiastical movement by asserting the\r\nsupremacy of civil law, even in matters directly ecclesiastical.[26]\r\nThree years later, the same hand which upheld the Pope in Rome took\r\nLombardy from Austria, and gave it to Piedmont, in exchange for\r\nSavoy and Nice. Tuscany, Parma, and Modena banished their dukes; the\r\nRomagna cast off the Papal yoke; and all these, uniting themselves to\r\nPiedmont, formed the kingdom of Italy.\r\n\r\nThese events were met, on the part of the Vatican, by more stringent\r\ndenunciations of modern liberties. In the _Civiltá_ these were\r\ninveighed against under the name of the principles of 1789. Liverani\r\nsays (p. 160) that the _Civiltá_, in a Catechism of Liberty, hardly\r\nleft a man the use of air and water. The article so alluded to gives\r\nwhat the writer of it calls a Litany, which ought to be repeated with\r\nthe refrain, Good Lord, deliver us.[27]\r\n\r\n    \"Liberty of conscience is a perverse opinion diffused by fraudulent\r\n    endeavours of infidels.\r\n\r\n    \"It is a corrupt fountain, a folly, a poisonous error.\r\n\r\n    \"It is an injury to the Church and the State, vaunted with\r\n    shameless impudence as becoming to religion.\r\n\r\n    \"It is the liberty of error and the death of the soul.\r\n\r\n    \"It is the abyss, the smoke whereof darkens the sun, and the\r\n    locusts out of which lay waste the earth.\r\n\r\n    \"The liberty of the press is an evil liberty, never sufficiently\r\n    execrated or abhorred.\r\n\r\n    \"It is an extravagance of doctrines, and a portentous monstrosity\r\n    of errors, at which we are horrified.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be incorrect to suppose that these principles exclude all\r\npossibility of toleration in fact, though not by right. Toleration may\r\nbe allowed, but never on principle; never but as the means of avoiding\r\na greater evil. If more harm to the cause of _religion_ would result,\r\nin any given country, from intolerance, than from toleration, the\r\nlatter becomes lawful to the prince of the country. Otherwise it cannot\r\nbe so. Even this qualified admission of a mere _de facto_ toleration of\r\nheretics was not left uncontested. Priests of the Appolonare in Rome\r\nabout this time, publicly maintained the thesis that \"it will never be\r\npossible to imagine reasons which should induce a Catholic prince to\r\ngrant liberty of worship to heretics.\" They maintained other theses, to\r\nthe effect that unlimited freedom of worship, and civil rights, granted\r\nto heretics, laid the prince open to suspicion of heresy, apostasy, or\r\natheism.[28] This doctrine, cries Liverani, would require the Catholic\r\nking of Saxony, with two millions of Protestant subjects, and fifty\r\nthousand Catholics, to exterminate the former by means of the latter.\r\nIt is, he says, putting this alternative--the creed or the stake. Yet\r\nthis debate was held in presence of the Pope's vicar, Cardinal Patrizi,\r\nand was noticed with commendation by the _Civiltá_.\r\n\r\nMontalembert proposed that the voting in the Romagna on the question of\r\nannexation to Italy should take place under the eye of French troops.\r\nLiverani, a native of the Romagna, prelate as he was, replied, \"If the\r\nFrench army left, without being replaced by a strong force to guard the\r\nlives of the clergy, at the end of a week all the priests and friars\r\nwould be exterminated, so wild and savage is the public indignation\r\nagainst the government of these last years\" (p. 46).\r\n\r\nOn March 26, 1860, in the famous and terrible Letters Apostolic _Cum\r\nCatholica_, all the actors and abettors of the territorial changes\r\nwere placed under the greater excommunication. The Pope[29] expressly\r\ndecreed that no hand but his own, or that of his successors, should\r\nhave the power of releasing any one of the countless offenders from\r\nthe ban, except in the article of death. He proceeds on what seems\r\nthe fair principle that the dominion of the Pontiff, though in its\r\nown nature temporal, takes on a spiritual character because of its\r\nspiritual design, as giving to the Head of the whole Church a position\r\nindependent of any one nation. Therefore, robbing him of it becomes a\r\nspiritual offence. If he is the representative of God upon earth, it\r\nis hard to see how rebellion against him can fail of being a spiritual\r\noffence. If he is not the representative of God upon earth, he has\r\naltogether misconceived his own position, and, like any other ruler,\r\nmay be judged by his merits, not by his pretensions.\r\n\r\nBefore the publication of the Pope's speeches we were exposed to\r\nmanifold interpretations of the spiritual import of this anathema.\r\nIt was even possible that we might find letters in the _Times_\r\nassuring us that the Church never curses. But on June 23, 1871, Pius\r\nIX uttered language which put his view of the spiritual import of his\r\nown action beyond cavil. He had the words afterwards reprinted, with\r\nthe explanation that the allusion to Peter referred to the death of\r\nAnanias and Sapphira. \"True,\" said the Pontiff, \"I cannot, like St.\r\nPeter, hurl certain thunders which turn bodies to ashes; nevertheless,\r\nI can hurl thunders which turn souls to ashes. And I have done it by\r\nexcommunicating all those who perpetrated the sacrilegious spoliation,\r\nor had a hand in it.\"[30]\r\n\r\nBut if to the spiritual eye of Pio Nono his curse had strewn Italy with\r\nthe ashes of millions of blasted souls, his Bulls were, in a temporal\r\npoint of view, as powerless as his dogmas. In the autumn of 1860, the\r\nPontiff saw Umbria and the Marches wrested from him by the new kingdom,\r\nto which also the whole of the Neapolitan territory was added by\r\nGaribaldi. After this, Europe grew impatient of the French occupation\r\nof Italy, and that last stay of his temporal power became painfully\r\ninsecure.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament in Turin proclaimed that Rome was the capital of Italy;\r\nand now we have to note the birth of one of those phrases which,\r\nbecoming watchwards, grow into appreciable forces in history. Cavour,\r\nin a speech, alluding to Montalembert, said great authorities had shown\r\nthat liberty might turn to the profit even of the Church. Montalembert\r\naddressed to him a reply, in October, 1860, in which he made use of\r\nthe words, \"A free Church in a free State.\" Five months later, when\r\nthe Turin Parliament set up the claim to Rome, Cavour used the same\r\nphrase. Montalembert, with literary jealousy, publicly claimed it: \"You\r\nhave done me the unexpected honour of using the formula I employed in\r\nwriting to you a few months ago.\" And, doubly to secure his patent\r\nright, as late as August, 1863, in a Catholic Congress at Malines, he\r\ndeclared that it was by the example of Belgium that he had been taught\r\na formula that had now become famous, \"which has been stolen from us\r\nby a great offender.\" He printed his address under the title, \"A Free\r\nChurch in a Free State.\"[31]\r\n\r\nThe French father of the phrase lived to write what showed that he had\r\nemployed it without having defined its terms in his own mind. Had its\r\nItalian foster-father, who repeated it in death, lived to govern with\r\nit, he would have learned, in the school of action, to select some one\r\nof the many interpretations which it invites, or else to discard it as\r\na formula, applicable, indeed, to a Church proper, and a State proper,\r\nbut incapable of application to a mixed institution like Romanism,\r\nwhich, however much of a Church, is still more of a State.\r\n\r\nThe loss of Rome, to which political symptoms now pointed as impending,\r\nwas a calamity to be warded off by all the weapons of the Papacy,\r\nsacred and profane. A great assembly of prelates was projected, to\r\nsurpass in splendour even that of 1854. It was to be equally well\r\nguarded against any parliamentary character. In June, 1862, three\r\nhundred bishops from all parts of the world were actually collected\r\naround their chief. The ceremonies during this assembly displayed\r\na gorgeous pomp, which even Rome, accustomed since the days of the\r\nEmperors to government by spectacle, was fain to recognize as an\r\neffort, and a success in its kind, worthy of the historical stake in\r\ndispute. The ostensible object was the canonization of certain Japanese\r\nmartyrs; but the real anxiety of the moment was so absorbing that the\r\nnew constellation in the heavens seemed to rise only to rule and decide\r\nquestions pending as to boundary lines on the earth.\r\n\r\nIn these turbulent and pitiless times, said the Pope, when the Church\r\nis pierced with so many wounds; when her rights, liberties, and\r\ndoctrines are so miserably violated, especially in Italy, \"we urgently\r\ndesire to have new patrons in the presence of God,\" by whose prevailing\r\nprayers the Church, buffeted with such a horrible tempest, as well as\r\ncivil society, may obtain the much-longed-for repose.[32] The aid of\r\nthe new patrons was that to which faith and hope pathetically turned,\r\nin the concluding prayer put up on Whit-Sunday by the Pontiff: \"Regard\r\nThy Church, now afflicted with such calamities: take not away Thy\r\nmercy from us; but for the sake of these Thy saints, and through their\r\nmerits, cause Thy Church,\" etc., etc.[33]\r\n\r\nBesides the influence to be exerted by the exalted Japanese on behalf\r\nof the temporal sovereignty, valuable results might attend a solemn\r\ndeclaration from the episcopate of the whole world. This would at all\r\nevents silence priests who had dared to think amiss, and would affect\r\nnot only the calculations of statesmen, but also the complexion of\r\npublic opinion. The faith of Romanists in a display is, to all who\r\nhave been trained not to take an impression for a reason, absolutely\r\nincomprehensible. Lamartine, in relating the perplexities of Mirabeau\r\nwhen the gusts of the Revolution had begun to appal even him, exactly\r\npictures what is the outcome of their sensuous training. \"He would save\r\nthe monarchy by a royal proclamation and a ceremony to make the king\r\npopular.\"\r\n\r\nA declaration was made by the assembled bishops with all possible\r\ngravity and force. The language chosen by Pope and prelates was the\r\nstrongest to be found. They were not content with pledging themselves\r\nto the temporal dominion as a good, useful, helpful, or urgently\r\ndesirable thing. Staking the future for the present, as well as the\r\nspiritual for the temporal, they declared that it was \"necessary\" in\r\norder to the exercise of the full pontifical authority over the whole\r\nChurch. If this is so, there has been no proper exercise of authority\r\nover the whole Church since 1870, nor can there be any till the Pope\r\nagain finds some few hundred thousand of Italians calling him king.\r\nIf it is not so, the collective hierarchy, and the Pope with them,\r\nerred in setting forth a doctrine, touching the Head of the Church, for\r\nthe guidance of all mankind. The Pope himself not only said that the\r\ntemporal power was necessary, but that it had been given by a matchless\r\ncounsel of Providence. The reason he gives for its necessity is the\r\nstock one, that the Pope may not be a dependent of any prince, as if\r\nhe had not been the helpless dependent of Napoleon III. The bishops,\r\nforgetting both this dependence and the sanguinary measures by which\r\nthe temporal power was upheld, actually used such words as \"noble,\r\ntranquil, and genial liberty.\"[34]\r\n\r\nBesides their testimony to the necessity of the temporal power, the\r\nbishops put on record words well adapted to prepare the way for the\r\ndogma of Papal infallibility--words often afterwards recalled to those\r\nof them who opposed that dogma in 1870. \"Thou art to us the teacher of\r\nsound doctrine, thou the centre of unity, thou the quenchless light\r\nof the nations, set up by divine wisdom. Thou art the rock, and the\r\nfoundation of the Church herself, against which the gates of hell shall\r\nnot prevail. When thou speakest, we hear Peter; when thou dost decree,\r\nwe yield obedience to Christ.\"[35]\r\n\r\nBut the new saints of 1862 did not turn the tide any more than the\r\n\"Immaculate\" of 1854 had done. Italy held together, though Cavour\r\nwas gone. The effort of the two Catholic emperors to secure Mexico\r\nfor the Church, by placing a monarch of approved principles on the\r\nthrone, ended in a tragic failure. The grief felt everywhere at the\r\nfate of Maximilian of Hapsburg was intensified for Pius IX, because,\r\nas it is expressed by Professor Massi, the promises made to the\r\nPope by Maximilian, when he came to Rome before taking the reins of\r\nempire, \"were to remain void.\"[36] Finally, in 1864, the Convention of\r\nSeptember brought home to the Pope the fact that, unless the Virgin\r\nshould work a miracle for him, he was to be abandoned by the foreign\r\nauxiliaries whose presence he hated, but the terror of whom was the\r\nonly shade in which he could rest. Perhaps he remembered how soon after\r\nthe foreign Emperor had held the Pope's bridle, the Italian Lambert\r\ncalled him \"My Lord,\" as he would have done to any other baron, and\r\ndrove him to hard straits.\r\n\r\nIt was in this position of affairs that the seers of the Vatican beheld\r\nall human institutions as if reduced by a cataclysm to a dark and\r\nroaring chaos. And on their principles chaos it was. Not only had kings\r\nand lawgivers withdrawn themselves from under the authority of the\r\nsupreme tribunal, not only had civil courts been withdrawn from under\r\nthe authority of the external tribunal, but almost all governments\r\nhad ceased to enforce by law the attendance of their subjects on\r\nthe internal tribunal of the Church which they thus degraded to the\r\nlevel of a voluntary confessional. In each of the three circles of\r\nall-embracing authority, therefore, order was now disrupted, and chaos\r\nhad broken in. The seer could see but one remedy. Society must be\r\nRECONSTRUCTED, and that upon the basis of one world-wide monarchy.\r\n\r\nIt is but slowly that minds accustomed to judge by ordinary standards\r\nlearn to attach a precise meaning to such expressions as the above, in\r\nthe language of the Vatican. Even after having learned how definite\r\nis the meaning, we do not soon begin to associate ideas of deliberate\r\nplan and serious expectation, with what would seem to be only dreams\r\nof the cloister. We therefore give a few clear sentences from _Il\r\nGenio Cattolico_, a publication praised by the authoritative _Unitá\r\nCattolica_.[37] It describes the true ideal of the Papacy as being\r\n\"an immense variety of languages, traditions, legislations, letters,\r\ncommerce, institutions, and alliances, under the moral and pacific\r\nempire of a single Father, who, with the sceptre of the word, upholds\r\nthe equilibrium of the world. The Papacy is not, as German jurists call\r\nit, a State within the State, but is a cosmopolitan authority, the\r\nmoderator of all States, the supreme and universal standard of law and\r\njustice. It is a world-wide monarchy, from which all other monarchies\r\nthat would call themselves Christian derive _life_, _order_, and\r\n_equilibrium_.\"\r\n\r\nCoupling this distinct conception of the appointed place of the Papacy\r\nin the human commonwealth with the equally distinct conviction that\r\nmodern society is in ruins, the writer proceeds: \"What is the remedy?\r\nThe recognition of a common father, who shall teach subjects to obey\r\nas sons, and sovereigns to rule as fathers; a _supreme judge, to\r\ndeclare and give sanctions to the rights_ of the one and the other.\r\nWithout this, how can the want of balance in the conflicting forces be\r\nredressed?\"\r\n\r\nWith views thus radical and all-comprehending did the Court of Pius IX\r\nproceed to build up, after a very ancient ideal, an empire over all\r\npeoples, nations, and languages, the test of which should be acceptance\r\nof the religious symbol set up by the autocrat. In the projected\r\nreconstruction the _ultimate end_, the restoration of facts, would\r\nalways include these cardinal points. Every man and every woman in\r\nChristendom, and, by a due extension of \"the kingdom of God,\" every man\r\nand every woman living, must be bound by law to appear, at the least\r\nannually, in the internal tribunal of the Church, the confessional. In\r\norder to this, every civil magistrate must be set in obvious and in\r\npractical subordination to the ecclesiastical magistrate or bishop,\r\nby the subjection of the civil court to the external tribunal of the\r\nChurch, the ecclesiastical court. In order to this, every king or\r\nlawgiver must be set also in obvious and in practical subordination\r\nto the supreme tribunal of the church, the Pope, by a restored state\r\nof international law, giving to the Pontiff, or, to speak accurately,\r\nrecognizing in the Pontiff what God had given to him, full power to\r\ndeliver sentence as supreme judge upon the rights of all kings, and\r\nupon the merits of every law.\r\n\r\nWe for the sake of clearness, say three tribunals, though technically\r\nthey are only two, the Pope being in both supreme. Whether the\r\nsubject enters by the _foro externo_ or by the _foro interno_, by the\r\necclesiastical court or by the confessional, both in the ultimate\r\ninstance conduct him to the one bar, that of the Judge of judges.\r\nThe supreme tribunal is he, in all causes not purely material, in\r\nall causes whereinto enters any moral or religious consideration.\r\nProtestants would seem generally to imagine that the ecclesiastical\r\ncourt is a higher tribunal than the confessional. Not so. When a\r\nconflict arises between the sentence of the external tribunal and that\r\nof the internal, the suitor at the bar of God's kingdom is bound by the\r\njudgment of the internal tribunal![38]\r\n\r\nIn Carleton's _Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry_, where the\r\nonly symbol of any tribunal is a rickety chair standing on an earthen\r\nfloor full of holes, the priest of God has no sooner put on robe and\r\nstole than \"the tribunal\" is as truly constituted as when in the palace\r\nof Charles V sat Domenico Soto with the imperial penitent kneeling\r\nbefore him, and said, \"So far you have confessed the sins of Charles,\r\nnow confess those of the Emperor.\" In that tribunal has the peasant\r\nbride to learn, and has the Queen to learn, that not the husband is\r\nthe head of the woman, but the priest of God. In that tribunal has the\r\nshoeless Connaught child and has the imperial prince to learn that not\r\nthe parents are the head of the children, but the priest of God. In\r\nthat tribunal has the debtor and has the creditor, the executor and the\r\nlegatee to learn that not the law of the civil bench obliges, but the\r\nlaw pronounced by the priest of God. In that tribunal have all these to\r\nlearn that not even the law which falls from the ecclesiastical judge\r\nin the external tribunal is to be taken, but that which in the internal\r\ntribunal, in holy secrecy, between the conscience alone and the judge\r\nalone, falls with full force of binding and of loosing from the lips of\r\nthe priest of God. So in the other, the external tribunal, has every\r\ncitizen to learn, and every public servant, that not the magistrate\r\nis the head of the town, and not the chief magistrate is the head of\r\nthe city, but that the bishop is head of both one and the other, for\r\nhe is the head of the priests of God. Finally, at the supreme bar have\r\nthe princes, the governors and captains, the judges, the treasurers,\r\nthe counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to\r\nlearn that not the president, not the grand duke, not the king, not\r\nthe emperor, is the head of the nation, but the thrice-crowned King of\r\nkings, the Great High Priest of God.\r\n\r\nThis kingdom, it is held, with some stretching of the facts, did in the\r\nAges of Faith prevail, and it is to be restored.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of facts could not be effected without a foregoing\r\nrestoration of the idea of Hildebrand. Constantine had founded a\r\nState Church. Leo III, with Charlemagne, had founded what Mr. Bryce\r\naccurately describes as a Catholic State, with the Pope as spiritual\r\nand the Emperor as temporal head. Cardinal Manning points out that in\r\nthis Mr. Bryce makes the holy Roman Empire a two-headed monster.[39]\r\nNevertheless Mr. Bryce gives the true human history, though doubtless\r\nCardinal Manning, following Boniface VIII, gives the correct Papal\r\ndoctrine. According to that doctrine, the dualism of a double-headed\r\nState amounted to a sort of Manicheism. History, which is guilty of\r\ntainting many with one heresy or another, must bear the fault of Mr.\r\nBryce's Manicheism. But Hildebrand would abolish all dualism. The whole\r\nworld must have one head. Constantine's idea of a State Church had its\r\nmerit of unity, but it was unity by perversion of rights. The true idea\r\nwas that of a Church State, embracing the whole world, and placing\r\nall mankind as one fold under one shepherd. This true idea was to be\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nWe shall in its place, be taught how we err in calling power over\r\ntemporal affairs temporal power. More accurately, does Cardinal\r\nManning speak of \"the supreme judicial power of the Church in temporal\r\nthings.\"[40] He speaks of \"the indirect spiritual power of the Church\r\nover the temporal State,\"[41] thus showing the error of the notion that\r\nspiritual power means only power over spiritual affairs. He speaks of\r\n\"the Christian jurisprudence in which the Roman Pontiff was recognized\r\nas the Supreme Judge of Princes and People, with a twofold coercion,\r\nspiritual by his own authority, and temporal by the secular arm.\"[42]\r\n\r\nThe turn of phraseology in the last sentence is probably not\r\nundesigned. Had it been employed by a Protestant, Ultramontanes, _if\r\nwriting in Italy_, would have cried out, Ignorance and inaccuracy!\r\nDoes the Cardinal mean that the authority whereby the Pope through the\r\nsecular arm applies temporal coercion is not his own authority? No,\r\nassuredly. Yet he leaves us in a position to slip into some such idea.\r\nIn such coercion as that of which he speaks it is not that the secular\r\npower acts of its own authority, but that it acts with its own arm,\r\nbut with the Pope's authority. The interesting doctrine of the Brahman\r\nas sprung from the Creator's head, and the King-caste as sprung from\r\nhis arm, reappears in the Papal system, in which the priest anointed\r\non the head and the prince anointed on the arm symbolize respectively\r\nthe authority that gives law and the force that carries it out.[43]\r\nBut Cardinal Manning's definition of _Christian_ jurisprudence as that\r\nwherein the Pope is recognized as supreme Judge of Prince and People is\r\nnot only strict, but it also explains a whole set of terms--_Christian_\r\ngovernment, _Christian_ law, _Christian_ order, _Christian_\r\ncivilization, and so forth.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious that to effect in Europe such a restoration as these\r\nclaims implied, a lengthened preparation of ideas must go before the\r\nrestoration of facts; and that restoration of ideas it was which we now\r\nsee undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: _Kurze Geschichte des Vaticanischen Concils_, p. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: _Roma Papale_, p. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: _Allocution of Dec. 15, 1856._ _Receuil_, p. 382.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: _Civiltá_, Serie IV. vol. iv. p. 430.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: _Liverani_, p. 163.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: _Receuil_, p. 400.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: _Discorsi_, vol. i. p. 158.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: See the whole narrative in _Unitá Cattolica_, March 17,\r\n1870.

There is, however,\r\na distinction between the anointing of the bishop and of the prince,\r\nbecause the head of the bishop is anointed with the ointment, but the\r\narm of the prince is rubbed with oil, that it may be shown what a\r\ndifference exists between the authority of the bishop and the power of\r\nthe prince.\"--_Phillips_, ii. 621--quoting Bennetti's _Priv. S. Petri\r\nVindiciæ_.\r\n\r\n\"Now, here are two things to be noted.

Its authorized\r\nexpounders, however, with remarkable unanimity, treat it as the\r\nfoundation for the enduring fabric of reconstructed society. Its form\r\naccounts for the first impression on the part of the outside world.\r\nIt is a series of _condemned_ propositions, drawn from official and\r\nauthoritative utterances of Pius IX--a syllabus or collection of\r\nerrors, condemned in judgments pronounced by him as supreme judge of\r\nChristendom. These, taken collectively, form a politico-ecclesiastical\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe eighty propositions range over most subjects. As all stand under\r\nthe head of _condemned errors_, each proposition is, logically,\r\nto be read with the prefix, \"We reprove and condemn the following\r\nproposition.\" Some of these sentences express the beliefs of infidels,\r\nand some those of all Christians but Romanists; some the crudest\r\nnotions of socialists, and some the fundamental principles of free\r\nStates, or the maxims of all thriving communities; some the crotchets\r\nof obscure theorists in philosophy and ethics, and some the postulates\r\nof all free science. These heterogeneous beliefs and disbeliefs are\r\nstrung together and delivered over, before the universe, to eternal\r\nanathema.\r\n\r\nPassing from abstract to concrete, embodiments of evil are condemned,\r\nwhether the body is a Church, a Bible Society, a Freemasons' lodge, a\r\npack of communists, or even such clandestine gangs as were known in\r\nChristendom only to the territory of the Pope and his favourite Italian\r\nprinces.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the eventual importance of this manifesto was, at the time,\r\nexaggerated at the Vatican, and is exaggerated even yet. \"In this\r\ncentury,\" says the _Genio Cattolico_, already quoted, \"rises up the\r\nsublime and gigantic figure of Pius IX, another Hildebrand. He is\r\ncharged by divine Providence with the erection in our day of a new\r\nedifice upon the débris of the religious and political revolution, as\r\nin former times Gregory VII was commissioned to reconstruct a similar\r\nedifice upon the scattered remains of tyranny. Gregory had his Dicta;\r\nPius IX has his Syllabus.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Civiltá Cattolica_ has never ceased to glorify the Syllabus. A\r\nperiodical, expressly devoted to expounding and commending it to the\r\nGermans, and making it the basis of a new social condition in that\r\ncountry, was commenced at a Jesuit monastery near Bonn, under the\r\ntitle of _Stimmen aus Maria Laach_. Catholic journals spoke of the\r\nuniversal scope and pregnant consequences of the Syllabus in terms\r\nat which men of the world were more inclined to smile than to take\r\nwarning. The views taken of the document by learned Catholics not of\r\nthe Ultramontane school are briefly put by Michelis: \"Constitutional\r\nfreedom, equality before the law, liberty of the Press, all the\r\nfoundations of modern civilization, were all at once pronounced to be\r\nhostile to the Catholic faith.\"[44] Hints were not wanting that it\r\nmight introduce a conflict which would rage through centuries, and\r\nperhaps leave nothing standing but the Church. Still, for the time,\r\npoliticians were rather annoyed than alarmed, and perhaps no Protestant\r\nstatesman thought the matter serious enough to feel even annoyance.\r\n\r\nProtestant statesmen were still somewhat in the state of mind expressed\r\nby Ranke: \"What is there that can now make the history of the Papacy\r\ninteresting and important to us? Not its peculiar relation to us,\r\nwhich can no longer affect us in any material point; nor the anxiety\r\nor dread which it can inspire. The times in which we had anything to\r\nfear are over; we are conscious of our perfect security. The papacy\r\ncan inspire us with no other interest than what arises from its\r\nhistorical development and its former influence.\" This prognostic,\r\nthe shortsightedness of which the Germans have been painfully taught,\r\nobviously sprang out of a confusion of ideas, expressed immediately\r\nafterwards, where Ranke identifies changing professions and claims\r\ndiplomatically presented with fixed maxims, with objects and claims\r\nfounded on cherished dogma, and felt to be inalienable. As to the\r\nPapacy, Ranke says, \"Complete metamorphoses have taken place in its\r\nmaxims, objects, and claims.\"[45]\r\n\r\nIn contrast with the indifference founded on this supposed change was\r\nthe view of the _Civiltá_ in surveying the events of 1864. The year had\r\nbeen, according to it, one marked by that silent preparation of ideas\r\nwhich brings around great events. To the unobserving this preparation\r\nwas unseen; but the process was going on and the issue certain. Casting\r\na glance around the world, the _Civiltá_ showed that everywhere what\r\nit calls the revolution, what we call representative government, was\r\nbecoming ruinous, and the old Catholic ideal of government regaining\r\nits place in the mind of the thoughtful. In Belgium, it had come to\r\nthat pass that an important paper declared that the tyranny of a\r\nmajority was worse than that of an autocrat. By a manifest Providence,\r\nthat immense Babylon the United States, founded on the principles of\r\nthe revolution, was broken up and undone. The new Mexican empire had\r\nall the more promise of stability, as it would retain, at least in\r\npart, Catholic principles.\r\n\r\nThis historical article proceeded to say that the greatest merit of the\r\npast year lay--\r\n\r\n    In the highly important pontifical documents with which it had\r\n    been so solemnly closed. The Encyclical of his Holiness Pius IX of\r\n    December 8, and the Syllabus accompanying it, speak clearly enough\r\n    of themselves, and need not our comments. Those exceedingly grave\r\n    utterances of pontifical wisdom and fortitude are already perused\r\n    in every tongue spoken by Catholics, that is, by the civilized\r\n    world. Nor do Catholics alone read them; even Liberals do so\r\n    too. And already we begin to hear a distant echo of the fear and\r\n    wrath felt by the Liberals. They, who themselves change moment by\r\n    moment, cannot understand that the Church should never change,\r\n    in her principles or in her doctrine. They, who would conciliate\r\n    everything--and, when they can do no more, conciliate fact with\r\n    law--by the stupid word _fait accompli_, cannot be at peace,\r\n    because the Church will not be reconciled to impiety and absurdity.\r\n    They do not believe with divine faith in the potency of the\r\n    pontifical word; but they do believe by an instinct of terror, as\r\n    the devils also believe and tremble. Hence the stream of filth now\r\n    vainly flowing against those documents from the Italian and foreign\r\n    journals. The Liberals tremble at this warning, and cannot restrain\r\n    their vexation, because so many hypocritical efforts to mask their\r\n    Liberalism under Catholicism are at last brought to nought. They\r\n    are now compelled to lay aside the mask more and more. No longer\r\n    can they deceive the simple. They must now declare themselves open\r\n    enemies of the Church and of her definitions.[46]\r\n\r\nThough the Syllabus is not even in profession a proclamation of the\r\nglory of Christ, or of the Christian verities, or of the mission of\r\nthe Church to turn sinners from their sins to God, but is formally\r\na charter of ecclesiastical dominion over civil society, the first\r\nfourteen of its eighty propositions are named as if drawn from the\r\ndomain of philosophy and theology. They, however, lay the doctrinal\r\nbasis for the political claims that follow.\r\n\r\nThe fifth proposition illustrates the difficulty of judging of the\r\npractice of the Church of Rome by her theory, or vice versa. She\r\ncondemns the following: \"That divine revelation is imperfect, and\r\ntherefore subject to a continuous and indefinite progress, which\r\ncorresponds to the progress of human reason.\" Persons not of her own\r\ncommunion would say that, except for the last clause, this might\r\nexpress the ground on which the fabric of Roman doctrine, properly\r\nso called, is built. Believing too much almost always springs from\r\nbelieving too little. He who believes enough about one God does not\r\nwant assistant divinities. He who believes enough about one Mediator\r\ndoes not want to multiply the number. He who believes enough about one\r\nrevelation does not want new revelations. Both the Councils of Trent\r\nand of the Vatican keep up the theory of only developing revelation.\r\nPractically their proceedings are pervaded with this principle, \"That\r\ndivine revelation is subject to continuous and indefinite progress.\"\r\nThe popular effect of this is that new _quasi_-revelations are of\r\nfrequent occurrence.[47]\r\n\r\nIt is, however, at the fifteenth proposition that the framers of\r\nthe Syllabus emerge into their natural element. In it the opinion\r\ncondemned is that every man is free to embrace and profess that\r\nreligion which he may esteem true, following the light of reason. This,\r\nwith the few other propositions under the head of Indifferentism and\r\nLatitudinarianism, prepare the way for a section, in which communism,\r\nclandestine societies, and Bible societies are bound into one bundle.\r\nThis again introduces the two great sections, that on the Church, and\r\nthat on the State. These together comprise thirty-seven propositions. A\r\nsection on ethics and one on marriage follow. Marriage is treated not\r\nat all in respect to the morals of wedded life, or to the sanctities of\r\nthe connubial and parental relation, but in respect to those questions\r\nwhich affect ecclesiastical authority and its relation to the civil.\r\nThe concluding sections treat of the temporal sovereignty, and of\r\nmodern Liberalism.\r\n\r\nWho would look for Liberalism under the improbable heading of\r\n_Naturalism_? yet both the _Civiltá_ and the _Stimmen_, proceeding on\r\nlines laid down by Bishop Pie of Poictiers, elaborately showed how the\r\n_fundamental heresy_ of all those condemned was Naturalism, because,\r\nviewed in the light of the Encyclical, all those errors converged in\r\nthe \"denial of the supernatural character of the Church.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the section treating of the Church, the first proposition affirms\r\nthe important principle as to the Church being a perfect society. Yet\r\nthis is put into a sentence containing explicitly or implicitly a\r\nnumber of propositions, some negative, some affirmative, and nearly all\r\nof great ambiguity. The error condemned is, \"The Church is not a true\r\nand perfect society completely free, nor is she invested with rights\r\nproper to herself and permanent, conferred by her divine Founder; but\r\nit belongs to the civil power to define the rights of the Church, and\r\nthe limits within which those rights are to be exercised\" (prop. 19).\r\nThis, be it remembered, is the proposition condemned. Keeping in view\r\nthe ambiguity of the several predicates, the following points are to be\r\nnoted--1. The Church is a perfect society. 2. The Church is completely\r\nfree. 3. The Church has the direct authority of Christ for her rights.\r\n4. The State cannot define the rights of the Church. 5. The State\r\ncannot even limit the exercise of those rights.\r\n\r\nThe broad denial of the right of the State to define or limit the\r\nrights of the Church, without distinction, is meant to cover, and, to\r\nVaticanists, does cover, the right of the Church to define the limits\r\nof her own authority as to its domain and as to its exercise, and\r\nconsequently the right to define the limits of the authority of the\r\nState, both as to its sphere and its exercise.\r\n\r\nYet, what is, at first sight, simpler to superficial readers than\r\ndenying the right of the State to define the rights of a Church? It is\r\na right of a Church to believe, to pray, to worship, and to preach. Is\r\nthe State to define such rights? It is a right claimed by one Church\r\nto pray any day to \"new patrons,\" whom, as Moses said, \"Thou hast not\r\nknown, thou, nor thy fathers\"; yet is the State to assume the function\r\nof defining such rights? But one Church also claims the right of\r\nemploying mercenaries and foreign auxiliaries to force a few millions\r\nof men of a fine race, in a fine country, to submit to her chief pastor\r\nas their king. She also claims the right to set her priests, in any\r\ncountry, before the princes of the nation; and the right, not merely\r\nto ask for an alteration of the law of the land, but to declare it\r\nvoid--the right even to tell subjects when and where they may lawfully\r\nbreak law.[48] Now, both classes of claims are covered by the one word\r\n\"rights,\" and the State is confidently warned off from a fort, or\r\nfrom the pamphlet of a seditious bishop, as if that ground was lawful\r\nChurch ground; indeed, as if it was holy, like the shrines of faith and\r\nworship sanctified by our Lord and His apostles.\r\n\r\nFather Bucceroni may be taken as fairly conveying the whole effect of\r\nthe Syllabus on the relations of the State to the Church, when he says\r\nthat \"Catholic civil society is bound to yield to the Church, even in\r\ntemporal affairs, if the advancement of a spiritual end calls for it\";\r\nand \"religion should be so positively protected that the _judgments of\r\nthe Church should never be obstructed_.\"\r\n\r\nIn resenting the prohibition of Napoleon III to promulgate the\r\nSyllabus in France, the _Civiltá_ spoke thus of the error which misled\r\npoliticians--\r\n\r\n    It proceeds from the belief that it is the civil authority\r\n    which permits the Church to exercise within its territory her\r\n    jurisdiction over the faithful. Nothing is more false. The\r\n    faithful, wherever found, are subject to the Church by the will of\r\n    Christ, and not by the will of the State. They must necessarily be\r\n    governed by two authorities, by the civil and the ecclesiastical,\r\n    each freely acting within its proper circle; yet the first in\r\n    subordination to the second, as the interests of the body are\r\n    subordinate to those of the soul. The Christian people, to whatever\r\n    nation they belong, be they Italians, Germans, or French, if\r\n    subjects of the Emperor as to things temporal, are also subjects of\r\n    the Pope as to things spiritual, and more of the Pope than of the\r\n    Emperor.\r\n\r\nLaughing at M. Langlais, who in the French Courts argued that the Pope\r\nin treating of the very foundations of political institutions had gone\r\nbeyond his proper sphere, that of faith and morals, the _Civiltá_ said--\r\n\r\n    According to our weak way of thinking, the legitimate argument\r\n    would have run thus: The Pope has a right to give a decision only\r\n    within the moral order: the Pope has given a decision as to such\r\n    and such propositions; therefore those propositions belong to the\r\n    moral order.[49]\r\n\r\nIn reading the following abstract it is to be remembered that we aim\r\nnot at giving a complete but a summary view of the effect of the\r\nSyllabus on the relations of Church and State, and that we do not\r\nnecessarily disapprove of each separate claim specified. Of course\r\nneither the disabilities of the State nor the powers of the Church here\r\nindicated are embodied in the existing institutions of any country.\r\nThey are only the disabilities on the one part, and the powers on the\r\nother, which would be embodied in the institutions of every country\r\ndid the tribunal of the Pope acquire the supremacy which it claims.\r\nWe need hardly remind careful readers that denying a proposition\r\ndoes not necessarily mean asserting its _contrary_. But it does at\r\nleast imply asserting its _contradictory_. Schrader indeed says that\r\nit is the contradictory of the condemned proposition that is to be\r\nmaintained. But his own counter-propositions do not adhere to that\r\nrule. What they assert is sometimes the _contrary_ of the condemned\r\nproposition. To explain these technical terms--One asserts that all\r\nEnglishmen are shopkeepers. You deny it. That denial does not pledge\r\nyou to assert that no Englishman is a shopkeeper; which proposition\r\nis the _contrary_ of the other. But it does pledge you at least to\r\nassert that some Englishmen are not shopkeepers; which proposition\r\nis the _contradictory_. Two contraries may be both false; of two\r\ncontradictories one must be false and the other true.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _SUMMARY OF POINTS ASSUMED IN THE SYLLABUS AS TO THE DISABILITIES\r\n    OF THE STATE, AND THE RIGHTS AND POWERS OF THE CHURCH_\r\n\r\n    DISABILITIES OF THE STATE\r\n\r\n    (N.B.--The numbers attached to the respective propositions indicate\r\n    the Articles of the Syllabus in which they are contained.)\r\n\r\n    The State has not the right to leave every man free to profess and\r\n    embrace whatever religion he shall deem true.

(37.)\r\n\r\n    It has not the right of asserting itself to be the fountain of all\r\n    rights; or of asserting a jurisdiction not limited by any other\r\n    jurisdiction, say that of the Pope. (39.) N.B.--_The absence of any\r\n    distinction between legal rights, of which the State alone is the\r\n    fountain, and natural rights, of which the laws that create legal\r\n    rights are but the recognition, is characteristic and pervasive._\r\n\r\n    It has not the right even of an indirect or negative power over\r\n    \"religious affairs.\" (41.)\r\n\r\n    It has not the right of _exequatur_, nor yet that of allowing an\r\n    appeal from an ecclesiastical court to a civil one.

(52.)\r\n\r\n    It has not the right to assist subjects who wish to abandon\r\n    monasteries or convents. (53.)\r\n\r\n    It has not the right to abolish monasteries or convents.

(67.)\r\n\r\n    It has not the right to prevent the Church from setting up\r\n    impediments which invalidate marriage. It has no right to set\r\n    up such impediments itself. It has no right to abolish such\r\n    impediments already existing. (67.)\r\n\r\n    It has not the right to uphold any marriage solemnized otherwise\r\n    than according to the form prescribed by the Council of Trent, even\r\n    if solemnized according to a form sanctioned by the civil law. (71.)\r\n\r\n    It has not the right to recognize any marriage between Christians\r\n    as valid, unless the Sacrament is included.

(74.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    RIGHTS AND POWERS OF THE CHURCH\r\n\r\n    N.B.--_In many cases, the propositions under this head show the\r\n    powers of the Church directly corresponding to the disabilities of\r\n    the State expressed under the previous head._\r\n\r\n    She has the right to interfere with the study of philosophy, and it\r\n    is not her duty to tolerate errors in it, or to leave it to correct\r\n    itself. (11.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to require the State not to leave every man free\r\n    to profess his own religion. (15.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to be perfectly free. She has the right to define\r\n    her own rights, and to define the limits within which they are to\r\n    be exercised. (19.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to exercise her power without the permission or\r\n    consent of the State. (20.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to bind Catholic teachers and authors, even in\r\n    matters additional to those which may have been decreed as articles\r\n    of belief binding on all. (22.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right of requiring it to be believed by all that\r\n    no Pope ever exceeded the bounds of his power; also that no\r\n    OEcumenical Council ever did so, and further, that neither the one\r\n    nor the other ever usurped the rights of princes. (23.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to employ force. (24.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to maintain that whatever temporal power is\r\n    found in the hands of a bishop, is not beyond what is inherent in\r\n    his office, and has not come from the State, and therefore is not\r\n    liable to be resumed by it. (25.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to claim dominion in temporal things for the\r\n    clergy and the Pope. (27.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to make bishops promulge the Pope's decrees\r\n    without consent of their rulers. (28.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to require it to be believed of all, that the\r\n    immunity of the Church, and of ecclesiastical persons, did not\r\n    arise out of civil law. (30.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to require that temporal causes, whether civil\r\n    or criminal, to which clergymen are parties, should be tried by\r\n    ecclesiastical tribunals. (31.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to alter the conclusions of a National Church\r\n    Council, and to reject the claim of the Government of the country\r\n    to have the matter decided in the terms adopted by such National\r\n    Council. (36.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to prevent the foundation of any National Church,\r\n    not subject to the authority of the Roman Pontiff. (37.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to reject any claim on the part of the State to\r\n    either a direct and positive or an indirect and negative power in\r\n    religious affairs, and more especially when the State is ruled by\r\n    an unbelieving prince. (41.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to reject the claim of the State to exercise a\r\n    power of _exequatur_, or to allow appeals from ecclesiastical to\r\n    civil tribunals. (41.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to exclude the civil power from all interference\r\n    in \"matters which appertain to\" religion, morals, and spiritual\r\n    government. Hence she has the right of excluding it from\r\n    pronouncing any judgment on instructions which may be issued by any\r\n    pastor of the Church for the guidance of conscience. (44.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to deprive the civil authority of the entire\r\n    government of public schools. (45.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to refuse to show the plan of study in clerical\r\n    seminaries to civil authorities. (46.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to fix the age for taking monastic vows both for\r\n    men and women, irrespective of the civil authority. (52.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to uphold the laws of religious orders against\r\n    the civil authority; the right to deprive the latter of power to\r\n    aid any who, after having taken vows, should seek to escape from\r\n    monasteries or nunneries; and the right to prevent it from taking\r\n    the houses, churches, or funds of religious orders under secular\r\n    management. (53.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right of holding kings and princes in subjection to her\r\n    jurisdiction, and of denying that their authority is superior to\r\n    her own in determining questions of jurisdiction. (54.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right of perpetuating the union of Church and State.\r\n    (55.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right of subjecting the study of philosophy, moral\r\n    science, and civil law, to ecclesiastical authority. (56.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right of enjoining a policy of intervention. (62.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to require the sacrament of marriage as essential\r\n    to every contract of marriage. (62.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to deprive the civil authority of power to\r\n    sanction divorce in any case. (67.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to enact impediments which invalidate marriage,\r\n    the right to prevent the State from doing so, also the right to\r\n    prevent it from annulling such impediments when existing. (68.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to require all to receive the Canons of Trent as\r\n    of dogmatical authority, namely, those Canons which anathematize\r\n    such as deny her the power of setting up impediments which\r\n    invalidate marriage. (70.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right of treating all marriages which are not\r\n    solemnized according to the form of the Council of Trent as\r\n    invalid, even those solemnized according to a form prescribed by\r\n    the civil law. (71.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right of annulling all marriages among Christians\r\n    solemnized only by civil contract. (73.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right of judging all matrimonial causes, and those\r\n    arising out of betrothals, in ecclesiastical courts. (74.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to require that the Catholic religion shall be\r\n    the only religion of the State, to the exclusion of all others.\r\n    (77.)\r\n\r\n    She has the right to prevent the State from granting the public\r\n    exercise of their own worship to persons immigrating into it. (78.)\r\n\r\n    She has the power of requiring the State not to permit free\r\n    expression of opinion. (79.)\r\n\r\nThe importance of questions affecting marriage and betrothal is\r\nthreefold. (1) Immense revenues accrue to the Court and bureaucracy\r\nof Rome from the system of dispensations for marrying within the\r\ndegrees forbidden in any one of the three separate scales of\r\nconsanguinity, affinity, or spiritual affinity, i.e., affinity\r\ncontracted by sponsorship at baptism or confirmation. (2) The grant,\r\nevery five years, of a QUINQUENNIAL FACULTY to the bishop to issue\r\nsuch dispensations as affect those distant degrees within which\r\ndispensations do not pay a tax, or to the poor who cannot pay, holds\r\nthe bishop in perpetual dependence on the Curia. (3) The whole system\r\nof impediments and dispensations subserves the end of extending the\r\ncontrol of the priesthood over domestic life through the reluctance\r\nfelt in families at the time of a marriage, as at that of a death, to\r\ncause scandal by a difference with \"the clergy.\"\r\n\r\nPhillips says (ii. 639) that in modern times the union of Church and\r\nState is frequently compared to wedlock--not an inapt figure, but one\r\ncalling for care lest it be taken in a wrong sense. \"That would be the\r\ncase if in this union the female partner was taken for the Church, and\r\nthe male partner for the State. If we employ this simile, we must think\r\nof the relative positions as just reversed.\" This seems reasonable. The\r\nlegal position of a married woman, a _feme covert_, would appear not\r\nill to correspond with that of a State bound to the husband, who calls\r\nhimself a mother.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: _Kurze Geschichte_, p. 10.

Their Eminences discussed the subject under four heads: 1.\r\nThe present condition of the world; 2. The desirableness or otherwise\r\nof resorting to the ultimate remedy of a General Council; 3. The\r\ndifficulties in the way of holding one, and the means of overcoming\r\nthem; 4. The subjects of which a Council might treat.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent consulters, or, as our historian loves to call them,\r\nthe purpled (_i porporati_), showed how the present age was remarkable\r\nfor progress in invention. This formed its favourable side. But then\r\nsuch progress served only temporal ends. The \"Christian government of\r\nthe world,\" as it existed in former ages, had given place to a system\r\nbased on the principle that society, as such, had nothing to do with\r\nGod. The points in the sad spectacle of this \"social apostasy,\" which\r\nmost distressed the Cardinals, were as follows--Education was withdrawn\r\nfrom the supreme vigilance of the Catholic Church, and consequently ran\r\ninto manifold errors; the doctrines of naturalism, rationalism, and\r\nvarious forms of pantheism prevailed, from which sprang socialism and\r\ncommunism.\r\n\r\nComing to political affairs, some of the writers mourned over the\r\nprevalence of revolutionary principles in general, some over freedom of\r\nworship and of the Press in particular, and some over the tyranny of\r\nthe State, which controlled education and charitable institutions--thus\r\nappropriating to itself all the social forces. Some, again, lamented\r\nthe violation of the rights of the Church in regard to laws affecting\r\nmarriage, to those on the holding of land, to the temporal sovereignty\r\nof the Pope, to the religious orders, and similar topics.\r\n\r\nThe practice of magnetism, clairvoyance, and spiritualism is\r\ndeplored by their Eminences as one great plague and shame of our\r\nepoch. Freemasonry, viewed \"in its true aspect,\" not as a benevolent\r\nassociation, but as an institution having for its ultimate aim the\r\nerection of a pretended church universal of humanity on the ruins of\r\nall religion, is said by several of the consulters to be the arm which\r\ncarries the modern theories into practice, and therefore is viewed as\r\none of the most potent enemies of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe next point noted is the influence exerted even upon Catholic\r\nteaching by the Reformation and by rationalism. It is shown that in\r\nphilosophy, as taught in some countries, the ancient system of the\r\nschools had been set aside, and, as all sciences are affected by\r\nphilosophy, it not unfrequently occurred that authors and professors\r\nattacked the pure doctrines of the faith. Some of them even evinced\r\na disposition to regard Rome as being ignorant of the relations of\r\nCatholic science to heretical and rationalistic science, or, at least,\r\nas not appreciating the necessities arising out of such relations. Nay,\r\nthey even displayed some unreadiness in submitting to her authority.\r\n\r\nOn the second point, that of the desirableness of holding a Council,\r\nnearly all the Cardinals were agreed. \"In the present confusion\r\nof principles and systems, the whole episcopate assembled in\r\nCouncil, pointing out the way of eternal salvation to nations and\r\nsovereigns, and also the true relation between the natural order\r\nand the supernatural order, with the rights and duties of governors\r\nand governed, would be a luminous beacon scattering the darkness\r\nthat covers the world. Perhaps in the presence of such a spectacle,\r\nheretical and schismatical societies would lay aside old prejudices,\r\nand would be drawn to a reunion.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the unanimity of the Cardinals was not complete. One advised\r\nthat the calling of a General Council should be reserved for times when\r\nsome great difference within the Church demanded a settlement. A second\r\nthought that the delicacy of some of the points to be handled, and the\r\nwant of that external support which the Church formerly possessed,\r\noutweighed any prospect of advantage. A third could not pronounce\r\nbetween advantages and disadvantages, but gladly left the decision with\r\nthe Sovereign Pontiff, whom God always assisted with special light.\r\n\r\nCecconi's statement as to the general agreement of the Cardinals\r\nappears to clash with that made by persons in Rome, who ought to be\r\nwell informed, and who affirm that, at first nearly all the Cardinals\r\nwere opposed to the Pope's desire, and only yielded to his ungovernable\r\nlonging to have his own infallibility proclaimed. Lord Acton says\r\nthe Cardinals gave their counsel against the project, and that the\r\nPope proceeded heedless of their opposition.[51] Both statements may\r\nbe correct; for even if the Cardinals had opposed the project when\r\ninformally talked about, they might yield when the official initiative\r\ntaken by their wilful sovereign convinced them that it was to be. One\r\nof the counsellors of Ali, the fourth caliph, when rebuked by Abdullah\r\nAbbas for giving bad advice in contradiction to good, previously\r\ngiven and rejected, replied, \"When a person, either through folly or\r\nobstinacy, is found to reject counsels which are obviously salutary, he\r\nmust expect to receive counsels of a complexion precisely the reverse.\"\r\n\r\nOn the third point, namely, that of the difficulties in the way of\r\nholding a Council, the Cardinals held that great prudence would\r\nbe required. The decrees of the Council would be received with\r\nindifference by the ungodly and the worldly, or would be made the\r\npretext for new trespasses against the Church. Then, as to governments,\r\nwould they permit the bishops to attend? Would they not prohibit\r\nthe execution in their territories of decrees not conformed to the\r\ninterests of those who held the power of the sword? Again, what would\r\nbe the use of new canons if the civil power would not further the\r\nexecution of them, or would even thwart it? And besides all this, the\r\npolitical horizon was clouded, and the Council might be interrupted. So\r\nfar for external difficulties.\r\n\r\nAs to internal ones, points noted were, the long absence of the bishops\r\nfrom their flocks, the risk of dissensions in the Council, and of\r\nconsequent scandal--a risk which appeared the greater as the thorny\r\ncharacter of some of the questions to be treated was considered. The\r\nCardinals also felt that there was some danger that a desire might\r\narise on the part of the bishops to extend their own privileges,\r\nalready too great, so much so as even to be hurtful to the practical\r\nuniformity of ecclesiastical government, as well as to the firmness of\r\necclesiastical discipline, and to the union of the bishops with the\r\nhead of the Church.\r\n\r\nOn the most important point of all, the subjects with which the Council\r\nshould deal, the summary of the notes given by Cecconi is so meagre as\r\nto suggest the idea either that the views of their Eminences must have\r\nbeen crude, or that they did not care to put on paper such views as\r\nwere matured; always supposing that the summary really represents the\r\nwhole of the contents. After a few generalities, the first particular\r\nsubject named for condemnation is the liberty of the Press, after which\r\nare named civil marriages, impediments to marriage, mixed marriages,\r\nand such like, with questions of ecclesiastical property, and the\r\nobservance of fasts and feasts.\r\n\r\nOnly two of the Cardinals mentioned the subject of Papal infallibility.\r\nA third named Gallicanism and the necessity of the temporal\r\nsovereignty. Only one mentioned the Syllabus.\r\n\r\nThe omission to name the Syllabus in this instance is one of a series\r\nof acts of reticence in respect of that document which are at least\r\ncurious. It is not mentioned in the Encyclical which accompanied it. It\r\nis not mentioned by the official historian at the time of its issue;\r\nand when, as we shall hereafter see, the Pope solemnly confirmed it\r\nin the presence of five hundred bishops, the act was not mentioned by\r\nthe Court organs. Further, the Syllabus was not mentioned even in the\r\nvery document by which the collective hierarchy expressed their solemn\r\nadhesion to it. Nor was the adhesion to it by letter of the prelates\r\nthen absent mentioned till, as our tale will show, all this was brought\r\nout by the friction of events.\r\n\r\nPoints in these notes to be borne in mind, as throwing light on the\r\nfuture of our history, are, that those who desired a Council hoped it\r\nwould be a short one, and were of opinion that the powers of bishops\r\nwere too great; and that the relations of the supernatural order and\r\nthe natural order must be regulated, i.e. reduced to rule. These two\r\ncommonwealths, commonly called the Church and State, had hitherto\r\nadjusted their relations, at least wherever Rome represented the\r\nsupernatural order, by the rough method of trials of strength and\r\nskill. The object of reducing their relations to rule would be to\r\nrestore that harmony of action which, according to the Curia, formerly\r\nexisted in happy ages, but had been lost in the changes of time.\r\nNaturally, this desired harmony could only be restored by each abiding,\r\naccording to rule, in its own place--the lower under the higher, and\r\nthe higher above the lower.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: _Zur Geschichte_, etc., p. 3.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nA Secret Commission to prepare for the Council, March 1865--First\r\nSummons--Points determined--Reasons why Princes are not consulted--Plan\r\nfor the Future Council.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn March, 1865, Cardinals Patrizi, Reisach, Panebianco, Bizzari, and\r\nCaterini were appointed a secret commission to make preparations for\r\nthe proposed Council. It was in the deepening grey of an evening in\r\nLent that the red coaches drove down the Via della Scrofa carrying\r\nthose Cardinals to their first meeting, in the palace of the Vicariate.\r\nRome did not know that this represented the first move in the\r\npreparation of one of those world-representing displays which had some\r\npart in bringing on her ancient decay, and a greater one in gilding\r\nit over: displays which, while changing in the accidents of form,\r\nhave retained the essential character of a sense-subduing pageant,\r\nand retained also the purpose of binding the city to an autocrat. The\r\nsignificance of the display now contemplated was to consist in showing\r\nboth Quirites and Italians that the world bowed down to the tiara, and\r\nso to bind Rome to the Pope for ever.\r\n\r\nAt this first meeting of the Commission, Giannelli read a memorandum\r\nintimating his belief that France, Italy, and Portugal would prohibit\r\ntheir bishops from attending a Council,--more particularly Italy; but\r\nas Germany, England, America, Spain, and others, would not do so,\r\na considerable number would be able to assemble. This indicates a\r\nconsciousness that political distrust of Rome was felt most strongly in\r\nRoman Catholic countries.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing this memorandum the Cardinals proceeded to consider the\r\nfollowing questions, and gave to each the answer indicated--\r\n\r\n1. Is the summoning of an OEcumenical Council under the circumstances\r\nnecessary, and opportune?\r\n\r\nAffirmed.\r\n\r\n2. Should Catholic princes be previously consulted?\r\n\r\nNegatived. Nevertheless, when the Bull of Convocation has been issued,\r\nit would be well and becoming for the Holy See to adopt suitable\r\nprocedures with the princes.\r\n\r\n3. Should the Sacred College be consulted before the issuing of the\r\nBull of Convocation, and if so, how?\r\n\r\nAffirmed; but in the manner to be determined by the Most Holy--or, in\r\ncommon speech, in such manner as the Pope may please.[52]\r\n\r\n4. Should a Special Congregation be appointed to direct affairs\r\nrelating to the Council?\r\n\r\nAffirmed.\r\n\r\n5. Should the Directing Congregation, after the publication of the\r\nBull, consult some bishops in different countries as to the subjects\r\nproper to be treated, both in doctrine and discipline, regard being had\r\nto the variety of countries?\r\n\r\nAffirmed.\r\n\r\nThe reason which led the Cardinals to negative the idea of consulting\r\nthe Catholic princes is supposed by Cecconi to have been a fear lest\r\nobstacles to the holding of a Council might be raised, and also lest\r\nthe proceeding might be interpreted as a recognition of the supremacy\r\nof the State (p. 29).\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of March these resolutions of the Commission were reported\r\nto the Pope, by whom they were approved with one slight modification.\r\nInstead of a consultation of certain select bishops after the\r\nconvocation of the Council, he appointed that it should take place\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe first step in carrying out these resolutions was the appointment\r\nof a Directing Congregation, which was composed of the Cardinals of\r\nthe Commission, with a few others, the number eventually being nine.\r\nThat body was in existence two years and a half before the hierarchy\r\ngenerally received an intimation, in a Secret Consistory, of the\r\nintention to hold a Council.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the Directing Congregation on March 19, the sketch\r\nof a plan for the labours of the Council was presented by one of\r\nits members, not named. He proposed that the work should be divided\r\ninto four branches, and that each should be assigned to a different\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n1. DOCTRINE, to be committed to the Inquisition, presided over by\r\na Cardinal of the Inquisition, the committee to be enlarged by the\r\naddition of some members not attached to the Holy Office. This\r\ncommittee could be subdivided into sections.\r\n\r\n2. ECCLESIASTICAL-POLITICAL AFFAIRS, to be committed to the\r\nCongregation for ecclesiastical affairs, enlarged by consulters and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n3. MISSIONS AND ORIENTAL CHURCHES, to be committed to the Propaganda\r\nand the Congregation of Oriental Rites.\r\n\r\n4. DISCIPLINE, to be committed to the congregation for bishops and\r\nregulars, with the addition of consulters, canonists, and theologians.\r\n\r\nEach committee was to be presided over by a Cardinal, and all were\r\nto report to the Directing Congregation, with which should rest the\r\nultimate authority.[53]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: \"_Juxta modum a Sanctissimo statuendum._\"--_Cecconi_, p.\r\n29.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: _Cecconi_, p. 322.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMemoranda of Thirty-six chosen Bishops, consulted under Bond of\r\nStrictest Secrecy, April to August, 1865--Doctrine of Church and\r\nState--Antagonism of History and the Embryo Dogma--Nuncios admitted to\r\nthe Secret--And Oriental Bishops.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 10 his Holiness sanctioned a letter to thirty-six select\r\nbishops of different countries, intimating under the most binding\r\nsecrecy his intention of holding a Council in the Holy City, at some\r\ntime yet undetermined, and requesting them to communicate their views\r\nas to the subjects proper to be treated.[54]\r\n\r\nIn August, nearly all the answers had arrived. Out of the thirty-six,\r\nonly three bishops cast doubts on the wisdom of the project; all the\r\nothers were rejoiced.\r\n\r\nThe letters of the thirty-six, according to Cecconi, expressed views\r\non the present condition of society coinciding with those of the\r\npurpled in Rome. The thirty-six generally remarked on the absence of\r\nany special heresies. When we come to particulars, the subjects which\r\nour author finds specified are: the right of the Church to hold land;\r\nher independence of the State; her right to control education; her\r\nright to judge what promotes and what hinders religion. Among other\r\nmatters noted, the chief are: the obligation of the faithful to adhere\r\nto the decisions of the Church, and in particular to those of the Holy\r\nSee, and the necessity of the temporal sovereignty of the Pope, with\r\n\"similar points.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Cecconi has apparently concluded his summary of the suggestions\r\nof the thirty-six, a sentence is slipped in, saying, that among the\r\nverities which ought to be propounded by the Council, some mentioned\r\nPapal infallibility--\"a doctrine admitted in all Catholic schools,\r\nwith a few exceptions.\" Hereupon departing from his general rule,\r\nand adopting marks of quotation, he gives the words of one particular\r\nbishop, without naming him. These bear directly on the point most\r\nagitated before and during the Council. Such English readers as know\r\nmuch of the controversy, will probably risk a guess as to the author,\r\nand it may be that persons in Munich will hardly stop at guessing, but\r\nwill say they know. It plainly was no Bavarian, not even a German,\r\nneither of whom would fall into such an expression as \"Munich in\r\nBavaria.\" \"At present there are but few who impugn this prerogative\r\nof the Roman Pontiff; and they do so, not from a theological point of\r\nview, but the better to assert and maintain the freedom of science. It\r\nwould seem that a school of theologians has sprung up with this object,\r\nat Munich, in Bavaria, in whose writings the principal aim is to lower\r\nthe Holy See, its authority and its mode of government, by the aid of\r\nhistorical dissertations, and to bring it into contempt, and above all\r\nto combat the infallibility of Peter teaching _ex cathedrâ_.\"\r\n\r\nThis language intimates that the science for which especially freedom\r\nwas claimed at Munich was history, which wants no other freedom than\r\nthat of learning the truth and telling it, that of detecting lies\r\nand forgeries and exposing them. Even the Court historian feels the\r\nsignificance of this announcement of the mutual antipathy existing\r\nbetween history and the embryo dogma.\r\n\r\nAmong the \"isms\" designated for anathema by the chosen thirty-six,\r\nthose which have any bearing on divinity proper could be named by\r\nmost ordinary readers. One \"ism\" to be condemned is regalism, or the\r\ndoctrine that the king is supreme in his own country; another is\r\nliberty of conscience and of the Press; and of course the bishops\r\nno more forget magnetism, somnambulism, and freemasonry, than their\r\npurpled superiors of the Curia.\r\n\r\nTwo points brought out under the head of discipline, are, the\r\nmobilization of the clergy, and the educational rights of the Church;\r\nstrong condemnation being levelled against mixed schools.\r\n\r\nAfter the secret preparations in Rome had been continued for nearly\r\ntwelve months, the circle of confidential advisers was further\r\nextended. On November 17, 1865, the Cardinal President of the Directing\r\nCongregation communicated the intention of his Holiness to the nuncios\r\nin Paris, Vienna, Munich, Madrid, and Brussels; and requested them to\r\nname canonists and theologians of sound principles, exemplary life, and\r\ndistinguished learning who might be called up to Rome to serve on the\r\npreparatory committees.\r\n\r\nThe next extension of the circle was to the Oriental bishops, who\r\nwere consulted by Cardinal Barnabò, the Prefect of the Propaganda.\r\nThey hailed the prospect of a Council, hoping that it might at length\r\nremove barriers which held the East in separation from Rome. Of these\r\nbarriers they name both ancient and modern instances. Among the former\r\nthe worst appears to be \"national spirit,\" and among the latter we\r\nfind Protestantism and the everlasting Freemasons. \"Nationalism\" is a\r\ntrial to the Papal Church in the west as well as in the east. Cardinal\r\nManning, in the Pastoral issued just before the Council met, said--\r\n\r\n    The definition of the infallibility of the Pontiff, speaking _ex\r\n    cathedrâ_, is needed to exclude from the minds of Catholics the\r\n    exaggerated spirit of national independence and pride, which has,\r\n    in these last centuries, so profoundly afflicted the Church. If\r\n    there be anything which a Catholic Englishman ought to know, it is\r\n    the subtle, stealthy influence by which the national spirit invades\r\n    and assimilates the Church to itself; and the bitter fruits of\r\n    heresy and schism which that assimilation legitimately bears.[55]\r\n\r\nThe clearest instance of the national spirit invading and assimilating\r\nthe Church to itself occurred in decaying Rome. The military and\r\nabsolutist spirit of the empire supplanted in the ministry and\r\norganization of the Church the original spirit of humility and\r\nbrotherhood. The spirit of the national pomps supplanted the primitive\r\nsuperiority to sensation and display. The spirit of the governing\r\nclasses set up side by side with the simple code of Christ a new code,\r\nmeant avowedly to restore the old Roman domination of law, under the\r\nform of a spiritual empire. The spirit of that domination claimed\r\nto impose upon other churches the will of the Church of the capital\r\nand did not scruple to call her the mother-church, and to support\r\nher claims with lie and forgery oft repeated. But after the Pope,\r\nconspiring with the minister of the Frankish king, and rising with him\r\nagainst their two sovereigns, had erected himself into a petty prince,\r\nthe national spirit of the empire began to narrow down to the municipal\r\none of aboriginal Rome. Ever since that time the municipal spirit has\r\nincreasingly become the spirit of the Papacy. Whatever that power has\r\neffected, it has never been able to make itself a nation. Aiming at\r\na universal empire, the spirit of its rule has become more and more\r\nclose, local, bureaucratic as that of any wee Italian republic of the\r\nmiddle ages. Men must not only act and move, but must also think and\r\nspeak, according to rules excogitated by certain guilds within the\r\nAurelian walls.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious but striking contrast between this professedly\r\nsupernatural institution and one which scarcely claimed a regular place\r\namong natural institutions. Coming up amid the decline and corruption\r\nof an empire older, richer, and more populous than had been the empire\r\nof Rome, the East India Company, in a couple of generations, made a\r\nnation out of some hundreds of States among which had raged yearly\r\nconflicts. That nation still contains many thrones, but within its\r\ncircle, and in spite of their jealousies, no less than two hundred\r\nand forty millions of men, a family immensely greater than Rome ever\r\ncursed with war or blessed with law, now live in peace and freedom\r\nsuch as were unknown to the ages which had aforetime passed over their\r\ncountry. On the plains around the presidential cities of India, where\r\na century ago Mahratta, Moslem, and Rajpoot were wont to ravage, now\r\nreigns peace at seed-time and peace at harvest. Security sits and sings\r\non every tree, and Industry, building her nest in every bush, sends out\r\nbroods that, free from fear, busily cover the land. What a contrast\r\nwith the endless whirl of war which in what are called the Ages of\r\nFaith--ages when the spells of the chief priest in Rome had power over\r\nsemi-barbarous chiefs--ever eddied on the plain around Rome, a glorious\r\nplain, growing waste and more and more waste, while kings came, now\r\nto be crowned, now to put a Pope in prison, and while Italians and\r\nforeigners rose and sank by turn in the alternating surges--foreigners,\r\nhowever, most frequently coming into the fight at the call of a\r\nself-asserting but mongrel and parasitical government, which claimed to\r\nbe the heaven-sent superior, not only of commercial corporations like\r\nthe East-India Company, but also of the very kings and emperors whom\r\nit played off against one another, and on whom it had always to rely.\r\nA national spirit indeed! Such a national spirit as we see in reformed\r\ncountries, and as was once in an inferior degree seen in the Gallican\r\nnation, is large, tolerant, and magnanimous compared with the tight,\r\npretentious municipal spirit unconsciously depicted by Liverani when\r\nhe enumerates the small men from small towns, puffed up with the name\r\nof cities, who, in the Curia, swelled themselves out with notions of\r\nworld-commanding importance--notions rendered possible only by their\r\nown helpless narrowness.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: _Cecconi_, p. 324.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: _The OEcumenical Council_, p. 52.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nInterruption of Preparations for Fourteen Months, through the\r\nconsequences of Sadowa--The French evacuate Rome--Alleged Double\r\nDealing of Napoleon III--_Civiltá_ on St. Bartholomew's--Change of\r\nPlan--Instead of a Council a Great Display--Serious Complaints of\r\nLiberal Catholics.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on May 24, 1866, that the Directing Congregation held its\r\nthird meeting, Monsignor Nina acting as secretary in the absence of\r\nGiannelli, who was indisposed. But, soon afterwards, dark clouds\r\nenveloped the Vatican, and ere the Congregation could again meet\r\nfourteen months had passed away.\r\n\r\nOn July 3, 1866, a shell burst at Sadowa which struck in three\r\ndifferent directions, and in each case the blow was heavy. Austria fell\r\nfrom the primacy of Germany, and from her place among Italian States.\r\nItaly, acquiring Venice, entered into full possession of herself, Rome\r\nalone excepted. The disjointed members of Germany moved to union under\r\nPrussia, like bone coming to its bone.\r\n\r\nThese were deplorable reversals of Papal policy, unfriendly both to\r\nthe temporal dominion at home and to the spiritual dominion abroad.\r\nBy the instrumentality of France and Austria it had been possible,\r\nfor ages, to keep Italy and Germany parcelled into small States,\r\neasily played off against one another, inimical to great national\r\norganizations or high national sentiment, and glad of an alliance with\r\na small State possessing an organization by which it could interfere\r\nalmost everywhere, and in almost everything. The long-continued success\r\nof the policy directed to this end seemed to stamp it as almost\r\nmiraculous. Had Germany united under the Hapsburgs, ready to keep\r\nItaly disunited, it would have mattered less to Rome. But her uniting\r\nunder the Hohenzollerns, and aiding Italy to become one, was doubly\r\ndangerous. Reconstruction as going on in Italy and Germany must be met\r\nby reconstruction on a universal scale.\r\n\r\nOn November 4, 1866, the people of Venetia carried their suffrages to\r\nthe feet of King Victor Emmanuel, while Austria and France sullenly\r\nacquiesced. The king said, \"Italy is made if not completed\"--a hint\r\nwhich the Vatican both understood and resented. Five weeks later,\r\nat four o'clock on the morning of December 11, Mr. Gladstone, whose\r\nname had already left a beneficent mark on the history of Italy, was\r\nwatching by the gaslight from a window in Rome as the French troops\r\nwound round the corner of a street, and he felt that the seed of great\r\nevents lay in that evacuation![56] That day the flag of red, white, and\r\nblue which for seventeen years had cast a light on the Vatican and a\r\nshadow on the Tiber, was lowered at St. Angelo. The Pope felt that it\r\nwould soon be succeeded by the red, white, and green. So that as if by\r\na historical parody on the old furor of the circus, the rage of parties\r\nin Rome was once more lashed up by the blue and the green respectively.\r\n\r\n\"Do not deceive yourselves,\" said the Pope to General Montebello, when\r\nhe presented himself to take leave; \"the revolution will come hither:\r\nit has proclaimed it: you have heard it, you have understood it and\r\nseen it.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Civiltá Cattolica_, alluding to the \"soporifics\" administered at\r\nthis irritating moment by French journalists and diplomatists, asked\r\nwhether France would hold the same language to Italy, now menacing the\r\nPope, as she had held to Austria and Spain when preparing to assist\r\nhim, namely, that \"any departure from the principle of non-intervention\r\nwould involve a war with France.\" She had not so spoken to Italy, and\r\nwould not do so, for had not Billault said, \"It is not possible to turn\r\nFrench bayonets against Italy.\" This being the case, France might hold\r\nher peace and not tease the respectable public with soporifics.[57]\r\n\r\nWhen Napoleon III, in the discourse from the throne, alluding to the\r\nfear of Rome being taken from the Pope, said that Europe would not\r\npermit an event which would throw confusion into the Catholic world,\r\nthe _Civiltá_ bitterly exposed his double dealing. Some would take this\r\nlanguage as a pledge to uphold the temporal power, but others would see\r\nthat it was only a shuffling of the responsibility off the shoulders of\r\nFrance on to those of Europe. Had he said France will not stand it? No,\r\nbut that Europe will not allow it.\r\n\r\nIt would be about this time that Viscount Poli and Arthur Guillemin,\r\na lieutenant of zouaves and a zealous crusader, sitting over a cup of\r\ncoffee, saw five gentlemen enter the coffeehouse who were not Romans,\r\nbut superintendents of a railway then being constructed. One of them\r\nlaid on the table a nosegay, so arranged that the colours formed \"the\r\ncockade of a king hostile to the Pontiff\"--doubtless red and white\r\ncamellias, forming, with their green leaves, the colours of Italy.\r\nGuillemin, who was in uniform, heard remarks which showed that the\r\ngentlemen knew what the flowers signified. He rose, seized the nosegay,\r\ndashed it to the ground, and trampled it to pieces. Then, as the others\r\ngrumbled, he drew out his revolver, laid it by his side, and went on\r\nsipping his coffee, and chatting with the Viscount.[58]\r\n\r\nThe _Civiltá_ was at this time publishing a series of articles on the\r\nmassacre of St. Bartholomew's, sometimes calling it \"the slaughter\" and\r\nsometimes \"the executions of Paris\"; and calculating that there might\r\nhave been some two thousand Protestants put to death in the capital,\r\nand, say, eight thousand in all France!\r\n\r\nAmong his other crimes, Bismarck stayed the preparations for the\r\nCouncil by the campaign of Sadowa. The most reverend Court historian\r\nevidently has no sense of any need for giving the world other reasons\r\nfor the total interruption of those preparations than the political\r\ntroubles. Yet one who learned Christianity at the feet of Christ would\r\nnot readily see why the studies of holy men in the mysteries of divine\r\nrevelation should depend upon a battle in Bohemia, or on the flitting\r\nof a French garrison. Surely, divines might go on searching into\r\nnaturalism, rationalism, pantheism, somnambulism, and freemasonry,\r\nwhether Germany was uniting or splitting up again. Nevertheless,\r\nstudies in regalism and Caesarism in the regular subordination of\r\nthe natural order to the supernatural, and in the best measures for\r\nreplacing the political system of Europe on the _divine basis_, or, as\r\nwe should say, for subordinating civil and restoring ecclesiastical\r\njurisdiction, were liable to be influenced by the flights of the\r\neagles. And the augurs who were tracing the lines for the foundations\r\nof the reconstruction, found in the movements of the eagles of Prussia\r\nand France omens that counselled delay.\r\n\r\nAccording to the original design, the Council was to be opened on the\r\nday observed as the eighteenth centennial anniversary of St. Peter's\r\nmartyrdom. But, owing to these sad interruptions, when 1867 approached\r\nthe secret preparations were not sufficiently advanced. Such, at least,\r\nis the only reason given by Cecconi why the Council was postponed.\r\n\r\nThe Pope, however, was resolved to cover St. Peter's day with glory.\r\nSo his own thrice sacred anniversary, that of \"the Immaculate,\" and\r\nof the Syllabus, was once more signalized by the issue of letters to\r\nthe bishops of the whole world, citing them to Rome for the 29th of\r\nthe ensuing June. They were not only to celebrate the centenary of\r\nPeter's martyrdom, but to take part in the canonization of some twenty\r\nadditional saints, and also to attend certain consistories. The second\r\nname upon the list of the \"new patrons in the presence of God\" about\r\nto be created was that of PETER DE ARBUES, \"Spanish inquisitor and\r\nmartyr,\"[59] of whose canonization we shall hear again. This invitation\r\nwas dated three days before the French evacuated Rome. As trusty\r\nbayonets were failing, additional celestial powers were to be called\r\ninto the firmament.\r\n\r\nAll this time the Liberal Catholics were becoming increasingly uneasy\r\nat the prospect of the dangers on which the Church was drifting. They\r\nhad hoped to see her first embrace and then dominate modern culture\r\nand liberties. This was a dream of O'Connell, of Lammenais, and of\r\nGioberti. At this aimed the erudite and steadfast German Catholics.\r\nBut every new utterance of the Court, whether in official document or\r\ninspired organ, showed that it was determined upon dragging the Church\r\nin an opposite direction. According to the policy to which it had fully\r\ncommitted itself, the Church was to conquer, not by adopting the modern\r\nage, but by restoring the middle ages. The dominion of the Pontiff over\r\nthe whole earth as spiritual despot and temporal suzerain was the ideal\r\nto which everything must give way. Montalembert, who had been flattered\r\nby the opening career of Pius IX, as sailors say they are flattered by\r\nwhat they call foxy weather, expresses himself as follows: \"I began as\r\nearly as 1852 to wrestle against the detestable political and religious\r\naberrations summed up in contemporary Ultramontanism.\" He showed that\r\nwhen in 1847 he defended the Jesuits of the Sonderbund against Thiers,\r\nas he did with equal eloquence and want of foresight, he did not utter\r\none word of the modern doctrines, and that for a good reason, because,\r\nhe says, \"No one had thought of setting them up when I entered on\r\npublic life.\" Indeed, he affirms that, in 1847, Gallicanism was dead,\r\nbut that it had been revived through the encouragement given to extreme\r\npretensions during the pontificate of Pius IX. He then quotes an\r\nimportant letter addressed to himself, in 1863, by Sibour, at that time\r\nArchbishop of Paris--\r\n\r\n    The new Ultramontane school is conducting us to a twofold\r\n    idolatry--idolatry of the temporal power and idolatry of the\r\n    spiritual power. When you, like myself, made a splendid profession\r\n    of Ultramontanism, you did not understand things in this fashion.\r\n    We defended the independence of the spiritual power against\r\n    the usurpations and pretensions of the temporal power; but we\r\n    respected the constitution of the State and the constitution of the\r\n    Church. We did not sweep away every intermediate power, or every\r\n    gradation of order, nor yet every legitimate resistance, nor all\r\n    individuality and spontaneity. The Pope and the Emperor were not\r\n    then--the former the whole Church, the latter the whole State.\r\n\r\nMontalembert goes on to say that the old Ultramontanes had recognized\r\nthe right of the Pope, in a great crisis, to rise above all rules;\r\nbut they did not confound the exception with the rule. These cares and\r\napprehensions were for the time concealed, and were only brought to\r\nlight by the anguish of that moment when the final leap downward was\r\nabout to place a gulf that could never be re-crossed between Rome and\r\nall things free and equal. But when the expression did come, it bore\r\nwith it the record of previous irritations.\r\n\r\n    \"The Ultramontane bishops,\" said Montalembert,[60] \"have pushed\r\n    everything to the extreme, and have argued to the utmost against\r\n    all liberties, those of the State as well as those of the Church.\"\r\n\r\n    \"If such a system was not of a nature to compromise the gravest\r\n    interests of religion, in the present, but much more in the future,\r\n    we might content ourselves with despising it; but when one has the\r\n    presentiment of the ills which are being prepared for us, it is\r\n    difficult to be silent and resigned.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: _Quarterly Review_, No. 275, p. 293.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: _Civiltá_, Serie VI, vol. ix, p. 126.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: _Civiltá_, Serie VII. iv. 418.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: _Cecconi_, p. 133.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: Letter quoted in the _Unitá Cattolica_, March 10, 1870.\r\n_Friedberg_, pp. 118-121.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nReprimand of Darboy, Archbishop of Paris, for disputing the Ordinary\r\nand Immediate Jurisdiction of the Pope in his Diocese--Sent in 1864,\r\nPublished in 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin a twelvemonth of the issue of the Syllabus, letters of\r\nsignificance were passing between Paris and Rome. One of those letters\r\nthrows light on the steps taken to grind down any bishop who dared to\r\nassert, as bishops used to do, some authority for their own office,\r\nindependent of the direct and universal meddling of Rome. That some\r\nprelates were still tempted to this offence we have seen hinted by the\r\nCardinal consulters, in the original notes upon the question of holding\r\na Council.\r\n\r\nOne of the most considerable figures in the hierarchy was Darboy,\r\nArchbishop of Paris, to whose name a historical death has given tragic\r\nimmortality. When the preparations for the issue of the Syllabus must\r\nhave been far advanced, in 1864, he had drawn upon himself letters\r\nof censure from Rome. To these he had replied both publicly in the\r\nsenate, and privately, in a manner which showed that some remnants\r\nof old French doctrines yet survived the modern influence in primary\r\nschools and episcopal seminaries. And wherever any sense of the\r\nancient office of a bishop did survive, there was constant irritation\r\nin the condition of dependence to which the system of _quinquennial\r\nfaculties_ reduced the men who, bearing the old name, held the modern\r\npost under the bureaux in Rome. Only a few weeks before the Magna\r\nCharta of reconstruction was promulged, on October 26, 1864, a letter\r\nwas addressed to Darboy which fills no less than ten octavo pages of\r\nsmall type in the documents of Friedberg.[61] Besides its solid value\r\nas instruction, this epistle has the interest of a sharp lecture.\r\nFurthermore, its very language coloured the most important of the\r\nVatican decrees.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel arises on the old subject of the \"exemption\" of the\r\nregulars from episcopal control, and the direct action of the Curia in\r\na diocese, over the head of a bishop and under his feet. Readers of\r\nChurch history will be tempted to think lightly of the Pope's candour\r\nwhen he speaks of Darboy's complaint as a new one, but however this\r\nsuspicion may touch those who furnished the materials for the letter,\r\nit does not attach to the Pope personally, for he is not usually\r\nsupposed to read history, though he often sets it to rights.\r\n\r\nIf inaccurate in his facts, Pius IX is orthodox in his policy, for\r\njust as bishops must be independent of the government of the country,\r\nso must the regulars be independent of the bishops, that power to set\r\nwheels in motion may be carried from the engine-house in Rome into the\r\nmidst of a nation by two perfectly independent shafts. When the Church\r\nis a national one, a bishop has some stake in the country, though\r\nslight compared with his stake at the Vatican; and he must, at all\r\nevents, keep up relations with the authorities. The former circumstance\r\nbrings temptations to a \"national spirit\"--one of the standing evils\r\ncried down by the Curia. The latter circumstance may make it convenient\r\nthat the bishop should not always know what is really the course of\r\naction being prepared. In both points of view the regulars can be\r\nutilized. Darius took care to have three separate powers in each\r\nprovince, all directly dependent on the Imperial Court alone.[62] And\r\nfrom his days highly organized Asiatic governments have had, besides\r\nthe apparently omnipotent lieutenants, confidential agents in every\r\nprovince, depending directly on the metropolitan authorities.\r\n\r\nThe Pontiff commences his letter by reminding his venerable brother\r\nthat he made professions of devotion to the Holy See on his elevation\r\nto that of Paris. Then he tells him that certain of his letters\r\nreplying to animadversions of the Pope, show him to hold views opposed\r\nto the divine primacy of the Roman Pontiff over the whole Church.\r\nDarboy had asserted that the power of the Pope, in a diocese other\r\nthan his own, was not _ordinary_ and _immediate_, but such as should\r\nbe interposed only as a last resource, in cases of manifest necessity.\r\nHe had represented the intervention of the Pope, by the exercise of\r\n_ordinary_ and _immediate_ jurisdiction, as turning a diocese into a\r\nmission, and a bishop into a vicar apostolic. Moreover, he had said,\r\nin the French senate, that when such intervention took place at the\r\nprivate instance of individuals, it rendered the administration of the\r\ndiocese all but impossible; and he had added that regulars, Nuncio,\r\nand Curia all aimed at bringing about such intervention as an ordinary\r\nthing, and that he would resist it and call upon the bishops and people\r\nto do so. He had even spoken of submitting letters apostolic to the\r\ngovernment, and of having recourse to the lay power; nay, he had gone\r\nso far as to mention the _Organic articles_, though he could not be\r\nignorant of how the Holy See had always protested against them.\r\n\r\nThe Pope could scarcely believe that his venerable brother had uttered\r\nsuch things, and was moved with wonder and anguish at finding him\r\navowing the condemned opinions of Febronius, which a bishop ought to\r\nabhor. In denying the \"immediate and ordinary\" jurisdiction of the\r\nPope, he had denied the decree of the fourth Lateran Council. The words\r\n\"feed My lambs, feed My sheep\" mean that believers all and singular\r\nare to be subject to Peter and his successors, as to the Lord Christ\r\nHimself, whose vicar upon earth the Roman Pontiff truly is. Every\r\nCatholic would reply to the charge as to a diocese being turned into\r\na mission, and a bishop into a vicar apostolic, by saying that it was\r\nas false as it would be to say that prefects, judges, or provincial\r\nmagistrates were not ordinary magistrates, because a direct, immediate,\r\nand ordinary power was held by the king or emperor.\r\n\r\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, continues the letter, had said \"the Pope has a\r\nplenitude of pontifical power, as a king in his kingdom, but bishops\r\nare received into a share of the solicitude, like judges set over\r\nparticular cities.\" As a Catholic bishop, Darboy ought to know that\r\nall had a right to appeal to Rome, none to appeal from her. Such a\r\ncomplaint as that the interference of Rome rendered the administration\r\nof a diocese almost impossible had never been made either in past\r\nages or in the present one. When Darboy spoke of appealing to bishops\r\nand people, he ought to have known that the same had been done by\r\nFebronius, and that it was an offence against the divine Author of the\r\nconstitution of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop had not been informed against, proceeded the Pope,\r\nby the regulars, but, from other quarters the fact came before his\r\nHoliness that the Archbishop had exercised the right of visitation\r\nover them, on which he had been admonished, and of this admonition he\r\nhad been pleased to speak, in the senate, as of a sentence delivered\r\nwithout the cause having been heard. It was hardly to be believed! The\r\nArchbishop knew the Decretals, and knew how, in all ages, the Popes\r\nhad written in the same manner to bishops when they became aware of\r\nsomething in their sees which was not quite right.\r\n\r\nAs it was a question of the visitation of regulars, it must be\r\nremembered that the right of exemption had long been enjoyed by the\r\nJesuits and Franciscans in Paris, and that the Apostolic See had\r\nexercised its own special or \"privative\" jurisdiction. Darboy had\r\nalleged that, by the law of the Council of Trent, regulars could not\r\nhave canonical existence in any diocese without consent of the bishop,\r\nwhich consent had never been received by the monks in question. But,\r\nhaving been long on the ground, they had acquired a prescriptive right,\r\nby virtual, if not by express, consent of successive bishops. And as\r\nto the fact that the civil law forbade them to possess land, of what\r\nuse were such laws in ecclesiastical administration? In these most\r\nturbulent and miserable times of noxious, odious rebellion, civil law\r\nmight even deny to bishops their civil standing.\r\n\r\nThe Pontiff cannot dissemble his extreme surprise and annoyance that\r\nhis venerable brother had attended the funeral of Marshal Magnan, the\r\nGrand Orient of the Freemasons, and had given the solemn absolution\r\nwhile the insignia of freemasonry were on the bier, and brethren of\r\nthe condemned sect wearing its orders were present. The sect aimed\r\nat corrupting all minds and manners; at destroying every idea of\r\nhonesty, virtue, truth, and justice; at diffusing monstrous opinions\r\nand abominable vices, fostering detestable crimes, and undermining all\r\nlegitimate authority; yea, at overturning the Catholic Church and civil\r\nsociety, and at expelling God from heaven.\r\n\r\nHis Holiness cannot pass over the fact that it has come to his ears\r\nthat an opinion has been expressed to the effect that acts of the Holy\r\nSee do not compel obedience unless the civil government has given\r\nauthority to carry them out. This opinion is pernicious, erroneous, and\r\ninjurious to the authority of the Holy See and to the interests of the\r\nfaithful. Furthermore, the Pope's venerable brother had incorrectly\r\nasserted in his speech that Benedict XIV in his Concordat with the\r\nKing of Sardinia had agreed that the royal sanction should be required\r\nbefore pontifical acts were carried into execution; and that according\r\nto the instructions annexed to the Concordat, they were to be submitted\r\nto the senate, except when they dealt with matters of dogma or morals;\r\nwhich false assertion the venerable brother would not have made had\r\nhe weighed the words of the instructions. The letter concludes with\r\nprotestations of the Pope's affection for his venerable brother and his\r\nflock.\r\n\r\nThis epistle, after being long held in reserve, was launched into\r\npublicity at a time when Darboy's influence was threatening to be\r\ninconvenient in the Council, and when the French government had\r\nrequested a cardinal's hat for him.[63]\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, not superfluous to remark that the terms \"plenitude\r\nof power\" as denoting the prerogative of the Pope, and \"_received_\r\nto a share of the solicitude,\" as denoting the origin and nature of\r\nthe bishop's authority, are not merely happy phrases, but scientific\r\nterms fitted to express the Papal theory of the Church constitution as\r\nopposed to the Episcopal theory. The Episcopal theory, holding that\r\nthe office of all bishops is of divine institution, regards the Pope,\r\nnot as the source of episcopal authority, but as supreme and ultimate\r\narbiter. According to the Papal theory, the authority of the bishop is\r\nan emanation from that of the Pope, who, as monarch, unlimited by any\r\nco-ordinate authority, retains in his own hands not only extraordinary\r\nbut ordinary, not only ultimate but immediate jurisdiction over every\r\nsubject within the bounds assigned to a bishop. The latter is a\r\nprefect, not only liable to be discharged or imprisoned, but liable\r\nwhile retained in office to have any matter taken out of his hands and\r\nsettled contrary to his views. This is the theory which, like a scourge\r\nof not small cords, is employed to flog Darboy, while the incongruous\r\nepithet \"venerable brother,\" dangles at the handle--a vestige of a\r\npast age and an exploded theory. An emperor does not call his prefect\r\n\"venerable brother.\"\r\n\r\nA portion of the letter which will well repay study is that indicating\r\nthe attitude of the Curia to all authority not immediately within its\r\nown hands, even if in the hands of its \"prefects.\" Against any such\r\nauthority it will receive the reports of its private agents, and treat\r\nthose reports as having the status of a legal appeal. It will act, if\r\nneed be, without hearing the accused, and maintain that none shall\r\nappeal from it, though all may appeal to it. This is the case even\r\nwith the episcopal authority; what, then, is the case with the civil?\r\nIt is swept aside as an unclean thing; \"of what use are such laws in\r\necclesiastical affairs?\" If Archbishop Darboy, strong in his character,\r\nstrong in his see--the largest in the Roman Catholic world--and strong\r\nin his influence at the Tuileries, is thus treated when complained of\r\nby the Jesuits, what must be the case with small prelates who venture\r\nto provoke their power?\r\n\r\nAs to the Freemasons, one is tempted to wish to be in their secret, for\r\nthen one would possess a rough test of Papal infallibility. If they do\r\nnot aim at overturning all government, and expelling God from heaven,\r\ninfallibility does not carry far.\r\n\r\nThe time for the great assembly was now approaching, and, meanwhile,\r\nthe Papal organs were enlivened by the prospect of a war between France\r\nand Prussia, on the question of Luxembourg. When this hope was deferred\r\nthe readers of the _Civiltá_[64] were informed that nevertheless every\r\npossible preparation for war was being pushed forward by the French on\r\nthe largest scale, and with greatly improved arms.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of May, 1867, the deputies Angeloni and Crotti were called\r\nup in the Italian Parliament to take the oaths and their seats.\r\nAngeloni did so; but Crotti, a well-known member of the Ultramontane\r\naristocracy, after pronouncing the words, \"I swear to be faithful\r\nto the king and constitution,\" added, \"saving always divine and\r\necclesiastical laws.\" This formula was at once recognized as being\r\nthat which had been published in Rome by the _Penetenzieria_, with\r\nthe declaration that the repetition of it was the only condition on\r\nwhich Catholics could accept seats in the Italian chambers. Called\r\nupon to take the oath in the form prescribed by the law of the land,\r\nCount Crotti stood firm by the higher law of the _Penetenzieria_, and\r\nthe Chamber disowning his _salvis legibus divinis et ecclesiasticis_,\r\nrefused to admit him.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: _Aktenstücke_, pp. 257-67.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: Rawlinson's _Ancient Monarchies_, vol. iv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: _Ce qui se Passe au Concile_, p. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: Serie VI. vol. x. p. 384.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nGreat Gathering in Rome, June 1867--Impressions and\r\nAnticipations--Improvements in the City--Louis Veuillot on the Great\r\nFuture.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole earth had been moved in the hope of not only exhibiting a\r\npageant outshining former ones, but also of carrying the dogma of Papal\r\ninfallibility by an ecclesiastical _coup d'état_, or, as it is called,\r\nby acclamation, without the delays of a discussion.[65] Had this been\r\naccomplished, the legislative form of a General Council would have\r\nbeen rendered futile for the time to come, or at the most, would have\r\nbeen but a grander method of working the institution of \"consultative\r\ndespotism,\" to adopt the strict definition of Montalembert. The\r\ninvitation had been enthusiastically responded to. The spectacle of\r\nthe Papacy menaced with the loss of Rome was touching, and the belief\r\nwas cherished that a great demonstration of the interest felt by the\r\nCatholic world on its behalf would contribute to ward off the peril.\r\nBesides these motives, another in full activity was the ever powerful\r\none, especially powerful with Romanists, the desire to see a pageant;\r\nand this sight was to surpass all the former displays of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe city put on its best, the churches were newly embellished, the\r\nstreets decked in festive array. Bishops came from all the ends of the\r\nearth, till the thoroughfares were mottled with the toilets of five\r\nhundred. Priests crowded in till, it is said, twelve thousand breathed\r\nthe sacred air of the city, every one of them proud to tread that spot\r\nof our unruly earth, where the priest was king of men.\r\n\r\nBesides the clergy, came such multitudes of pilgrims that, according\r\nto Cecconi, the population of the city was almost doubled. The\r\nRomans saw their familiar rite, the worship of the statue of St.\r\nPeter--_l'adorazione della statua di San Pietro_--performed on a\r\nprodigious scale. In modern as in ancient Rome, adoration has its\r\ndegrees; all worship does not imply the ascription of supreme, but\r\nonly of celestial, honours. No Pontiff in the days of the Republic\r\never pretended that Quirinus was creator of the world and father of\r\neternity. He was the protecting divinity of Rome, but with very limited\r\npowers in comparison with Peter, carrying no sceptre equal to the keys.\r\n\r\nSuch of the visitors as had seen the city in former times, if not\r\ntoo much pre-occupied with the sanctity of the place to observe such\r\nmatters, would find several improvements. Side pavements had been\r\nallowed in the main streets. Gaslight had, after long and painful\r\nefforts, been admitted.\r\n\r\nRailways had entered the walls. The personal liberality of the Pope\r\nhad effected several improvements, both in public works and charitable\r\ninstitutions. The French had done a great deal for the cleansing of the\r\nstreets, although the filth of some of them, and the indecency of some\r\nof the bye ones, were still beyond belief to any one from England. The\r\nPope's army, which as late as 1860 was an odd-looking array, was now a\r\nsightly and active force, composed mainly of foreigners, in large part\r\nFrench. And, finally, it had become possible to tell the time of day.\r\n\r\nFormerly, midday had been one of the mysteries of Rome. It seemed as if\r\nthe right of private judgment, banished from the churches, had taken\r\nrefuge in the steeples, for each particular clock went off at some\r\nmysterious impulse, and struck twelve at the noon of its own. Thus\r\nfor good part of an hour, they do say often longer, the air continued\r\nthrilling with the tidings that it was just noon of day. Naughty Romans\r\nascribe the change to General Baraguay d'Hilliers, while in command\r\nof the French garrison. Having vainly endeavoured to get a standard\r\nof time established, he presumed, with French audacity, to carry the\r\ncase by appeal from the sacristy to the sun. Placing a gun on Fort\r\nSt. Angelo, with a burning-glass upon it, he stole the tidings from\r\nanother world which were not to be got from the temples at hand.[66]\r\n\r\nOne of the most powerful of the pilgrims was M. Louis Veuillot, who as\r\neditor of the _Univers_ had for very many years done much to second\r\nin literature the work done in schools, of reviving antipathies and\r\nsuperstitions which were in danger of dying out in France. His notes of\r\nthis visit form part of his two octavos. As soon as he reaches the foot\r\nof the Alps, at Susa, he begins to scold Italy and the Italians, takes\r\nevery opportunity of doing so, and goes out of the country scolding\r\nworse than when he came in.\r\n\r\nBut if Italy and the Italians were exceedingly evil in the eyes of M.\r\nVeuillot, he found compensation in the perfect loveliness of Rome and\r\nthe Romans. The very cabmen are loudly praised, and the cabs carry\r\n\"ideas;\" the Press, especially the _Civiltá_, is of course far above\r\nthe French level. But the Pope was the grandest spectacle of all. As he\r\nentered the Basilica, preceded by a train of five hundred prelates, it\r\nmade an impression of power greater than if four millions of men had\r\ndefiled past, armed with the most perfect artillery.[67]\r\n\r\nNaturally, however, the imagination of M. Veuillot was most fired with\r\nthe prospect of that historical future which was about to open on the\r\nhuman species. Darkness still covers the chaos after the cataclysm,\r\nbut the breaking of the light draws nigh. The news of a projected\r\nCouncil has reached the ears of M. Veuillot. His first word is, \"Rome\r\nis officially taking the reins of the world into her hand.\" Other\r\nexpressions scattered up and down his animated pages are as follows--\r\n\r\n    The day that the Council is convoked the counter-revolution will\r\n    commence.... Pius IX will open his mouth, and the great word, Let\r\n    there be light, will proceed out of his lips.... It will be a\r\n    solemn date in history; it will witness the laying of the immovable\r\n    stone of Re-construction.... At the voice of the Pontiff the bowels\r\n    of the earth will be moved, to give birth to the new civilization\r\n    of the Cross.... Here is the great reservoir whence the future will\r\n    pour out and overflow the human race.... These days in Rome are a\r\n    revelation of the state of the world, and the starting point of a\r\n    renovation.... The pilgrimage of Catholic Europe to Rome in 1867\r\n    will have consequences of which the _Moniteur_ [alluding to remarks\r\n    in that journal] will be informed hereafter, and of which the world\r\n    will become aware when the _Moniteur_ would wish them to be unheard\r\n    of.... For centuries Rome has not seen the Pope in such splendour,\r\n    nor has he so manifestly appeared in his character as head of the\r\n    human race.\r\n\r\nM. Veuillot is of course one of those who look on the modern liberty of\r\nthe press as a great curse. We may insert here what came to hand long\r\nafter these pages were written, as an illustration of the kind of Press\r\nthat is to be quenched. The _Times_ of January 26, 1876, in the letter\r\nof its Paris correspondent, gives a morsel from the _Univers_, in the\r\nstyle of M. Veuillot. The _Times_ had said something about an interview\r\nof the Marquis of Ripon, as a new convert, with the Pope. The _Univers_\r\ndevotes to that article \"a column and a half of invectives,\" and thus\r\nwinds up: \"The _Times_ is now the giant of the Press, and prospers\r\nin both hemispheres. But the day will come when the two worlds will\r\nwant no more of its agony column, or of its bad literature; and its\r\nlast compositor, inactive before his immense poison machine, suddenly\r\nidle, will wait in vain for copy which will never come.\" Will the\r\ncompositor look out of the top window in Queen Victoria Street to see\r\nif Macaulay's New Zealander has arrived on London Bridge?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: Acton, _Zur. Ges._, p. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: This was first told me by a Roman tradesman, in presence,\r\namong others, of a very good-natured canon, who joined in the general\r\nlaugh at my innocent surprise. This year (1875) an ex-officer of the\r\nPope's service added, \"Ay, but the priests bribed the artillerymen\r\nto steal half the charge of powder, and to turn the gun toward the\r\nCampagna, so that the report should scarcely be heard.\" Probably\r\nthe last statement is a mere rumour, not representing any actual\r\ntransaction, but indicating, really enough, the state of mind of the\r\npeople as to what their masters were likely to do. I have heard it said\r\nthat Sir James Hudson used to declare that when first appointed to\r\nTurin he could walk all round the city while it struck twelve o'clock.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: _Rome pendant le Concile_, vol. i. p. 35.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nThe Political Lesson of the Gathering, namely, All are called upon to\r\nrecognize in the Papal States the Model State of the World--Survey of\r\nthose States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Opportuneness of the Centenary of St. Peter for reviving the True\r\nIdea of the Political Order among States_,\" is the heading of an\r\narticle in the _Civiltá Cattolica_ for 1867. The first words are, \"He\r\nwho comes to Rome finds St. Peter become a king\"; a proposition of\r\nwhich we should modify the predicate, saying, He who comes to Rome\r\nfinds a king, professing to be St. Peter. \"He (i.e. Peter) has joined\r\nthe tiara of the Pontiff to the crown of the Prince.\" Why did not the\r\nwriter say the \"tiara of the Apostle\"? That would be too great an\r\noffence against antiquity. It is the tiara of the Pontiff, as if Peter\r\nhad taken over that office from Nero.\r\n\r\nHowever, these are but the introductory notes. The writer proceeds to\r\nexpound the political effects of baptism. Christianity has not changed\r\nthe civil power as to its substance, but as to its relations, by making\r\na change in the subject of power. That subject is no longer mere man,\r\nbut man made Christian by baptism. This doctrine--which frequently\r\nreappears as the theological basis of reconstruction--is more fully\r\nstated by M. Veuillot: \"They will not deny that the true human race is\r\nbaptized humanity.... It is, then, baptism which constitutes humanity,\r\nand all that has not been introduced into the Church by baptism is, in\r\nreality, only a sort of raw material, which as yet awaits the breath\r\nof life\" (p. cxii.). In order to prevent any conflict between baptized\r\nman and the law of the Church, the _civil power must be subject to the\r\nChurch_. Suarez is quoted to the effect that as a man would not be\r\nrightly constituted unless the body were subject to the soul, neither\r\nwould the Church be rightly established unless the temporal power were\r\nsubject to the spiritual. And hence, the political conclusion is firmly\r\ndrawn: \"The idea of such a subordination is realized in the pontifical\r\ngovernment. Because, owing to the peculiar character of him who here\r\nholds the temporal power, it cannot rebel against the spiritual power,\r\ncivil law can never here set itself against evangelical law, nor is any\r\npolitical act possible which should offend against morals.\"\r\n\r\nThe last affirmation will appear boldest to those who best know what\r\npolitical acts have been done in the Roman States, and in the present\r\nreign. No one of these acts could offend against Christian morals! for\r\nthe all-sufficing reason that Peter had become the king, and Peter does\r\nno wrong. Thus we find infallibility, as received in the court creed,\r\ncovering measures of taxation and police, as well as lotteries and\r\nmonopolies--an abuse of the doctrine made still more obvious by what\r\nfollows, in which the infallibility of the Government is grounded on\r\nits immaculate conception, and consequently perfect nature. Since in\r\nthe Pontifical States \"the laws must be sanctioned by him who holds\r\nthe place of God on earth, him whom God has given to us for guide and\r\nteacher, they can never be in conflict with the divine will.[68] The\r\ninfallible Depositary of evangelical interests can never sacrifice them\r\nto earthly ones. Though in such a government the two powers [spiritual\r\nand temporal] are distinct in form, they are in complete harmony and\r\nduly co-ordinated one with the other, presenting to lay States the\r\nperfect example of the Christian civil power.\"\r\n\r\nIt is granted that lay States can never equal this example, but they\r\nought to imitate it. By their very conception they can never be free\r\nfrom the original taint, owing to which it becomes possible for \"the\r\ntemporal power to rebel against the spiritual power.\" Not only is\r\nit possible, but, by their nature, they are predisposed to that sin\r\nof sins. But all rulers of lay States are to know that in becoming\r\nsubjects of the Church the subjects of civil power have been changed,\r\nthough the substance of civil power has not been changed. We do not\r\nstay to inquire what may be the substance of civil power, after its\r\nsubjects have been lifted above obedience to it by another human\r\npower, higher than itself in all things wherein the two may come into\r\ncollision.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the faithful are told that the centenary of St. Peter,\r\nby bringing together people from all parts of the world, will give to\r\nthem the opportunity of beholding \"a State in which peace, morality,\r\nand justice reign. It is like an oasis amid the desolation of the\r\ndesert; and it is so because the political order is in full harmony\r\nwith evangelical law.\"\r\n\r\nThe approaching pilgrims, in comparing the oasis into which they were\r\nabout to enter, with the deserts from which they had emerged, would\r\nbe able to judge by the experience of centuries as to whether, where\r\nPeter reigns, the lifting up of the subject above lay government\r\ninto the supernatural order had led to the elevation of the laity to\r\nsupernatural goodness, or to the lowering of the clergy to the level of\r\npolitical officials.\r\n\r\nTwo writers, as dissimilar as Addison and Edgar Quinet, had, in some\r\ndegree, anticipated the comparison here challenged, each speaking\r\nfrom a point of view suited to his own day and mode of thinking. The\r\nEnglishman remarks how great is the difference between Roman Catholic\r\npopulations where they touch upon reformed countries and where they are\r\nunder the unbroken influence of the Papacy. Ignorance, superstition,\r\nand crime gradually deepen till the Alps and the Pyrenees are passed,\r\nwhen all these become strikingly worse.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman says that there was only one model country in Europe.\r\nThis was correct; for France had never cast out the influence of the\r\nReformation, or made away with all the Protestants; and had, moreover,\r\nbeen the hotbed of what Quinet calls the philosophers. Italy, again,\r\nhad always been a stronghold of the so-called philosophers, although\r\nall the Protestants had been consumed. In Spain, however, as he points\r\nout, the Inquisition had really fulfilled its mission; both Protestants\r\nand philosophers having been annihilated, schools and letters having\r\nbeen reduced to order, and the whole nation having been made to move\r\nfor more than two hundred years on the Papal lines. The consequence\r\nwas the total ruin of religion in the country.[69]\r\n\r\nThe comparison to which strangers were challenged by the Curia had\r\nthe great advantage of being a comparison of good, not of evil. If\r\nthe Papal States are to lay States as the oasis to the desert, proof\r\nactually lies before us of something more than human superiority--of\r\nsomething amounting to a higher dispensation. If the Papal States are\r\nbut moderately superior to others, proof of any higher dispensation\r\nfails; but proof of human superiority remains. If they are only\r\nequal to lay States even proof of human superiority fails. If they\r\nare inferior, proof fails both of divine commission and of human\r\nsuperiority, and proof arises of the presence of greater human fault.\r\n\r\nThe only true book of Positive Philosophy yet (we do not say of\r\nPositive Science) is the blessed old Books of books. It brings\r\neverything to the test of fruits. It puts the extraordinary man to the\r\ntest before ordinary men. He who refuses the ordained appeal to the\r\nWord, and to fruits, and to the verdict of every man's conscience,\r\nwrites his own description as a false prophet.\r\n\r\nWe shall not, therefore, set out to compare evil, but good. We shall\r\nnot inquire if there are more waste acres in the Papal States, more\r\nfilthy huts, more wretched villages, more mean little towns called\r\ncities, more blighted prospects, talents thrown to waste, and families\r\nbrought to decay, more liars, thieves, drunkards, blasphemers, and\r\nlibertines, more depraved homes, more guilty conspiracies, more\r\nstrikers, robbers, and assassins, more beggars in the streets, more\r\nidlers and extortioners in office, more wretches in prison, and more\r\ndead men in graves dug by the law, than, say, in our own far from\r\nimmaculate or infallible England. We shall only look for the opposite\r\nof all these, and more of it--so much more as would furnish proof of a\r\nspecial dispensation of God's loving-kindness to men.\r\n\r\nIn one particular, such of the pilgrims as had heard of the desolation\r\nof the Roman Campagna would feel surprise, somewhat similar to that\r\noften felt by travellers in the Desert of Sinai. The latter, expecting\r\nto find extended plains of burning sand--a Sahara--find a country\r\nlike another, only that it has no vegetation. So when pilgrims on the\r\nCampagna found green plains basking under a lovely sky, they would\r\nwonder how men could call it waste. Only by degrees would they realize\r\nthe fact that there were no farm-houses, no labourers' cottages, no\r\nhamlets. In Arabia vegetation has failed, and with it animal existence.\r\nThis region is a degree less desert: the herb enjoys life and supports\r\nthe beast; only man has failed.\r\n\r\nA trained observer seeing the plain forsaken and the villages in\r\nmilitary positions on the heights, would at once say, as he would\r\nin Syria: The land has not learned what rest is! It has not yet\r\nexperienced, for any continuance, that lot of conscious security in\r\nwhich the family suffices to itself, the lonely house is safe, and\r\nthe village needs neither wall nor steep. The valleys of Tuscany or\r\nPiedmont tell a better tale of law and government.\r\n\r\nWhen, at wide intervals, an inn or what is called a _Tenuia_ occurs,\r\nperhaps it is announced by a few fine children, ill-clad and begging.\r\nThe house has an expression of fear. The windows are few and small, and\r\nthe yard, instead of a fence or low wall, is defended by a high one.\r\nThere are no stack yards, no farm store and treasure spreading securely\r\nand ornamentally around as if conscious of strong, benign protectors.\r\nThere is no grass-plot, no gravelled or flagged walk, no flower-bed\r\nbefore the door, no flower pot in the window, no garden. The house\r\nhas never blossomed into the home. It is, after all these ages, but a\r\nshelter from weather and violence.\r\n\r\nEntering, you find dirt to a degree neither easy to believe nor\r\npleasant to describe, which grows worse and worse the longer and\r\nmore minutely you observe. The furniture consists of a few stools,\r\na rough table or bench, with a sack or two of straw for a bed. The\r\nfew utensils, whether of earthenware or metal, are, like the stools\r\nand bench, poor in quality, rude in form, and ill-kept. Scarcely\r\never is there against the walls a print or photograph, an engraved\r\nsheet, a clock or plaster bust. You look in vain for book, periodical,\r\nor journal. The idea of children's picture-books, or of a cottage\r\nlibrary, is out of the question; and the Bible is not to be seen.\r\nIf there be a picture of the Madonna or the patron saint, it is,\r\nin point of art, far below the pictures which often light up the\r\ncottage of our humblest labourer. If there is a book, it is a wretched\r\ndream-book teaching how to succeed in the lottery. No polished chest of\r\ndrawers, no white dresser, no fire range bearing witness of taste and\r\n\"elbow-grease,\" no pretty crockery, no easy-chair. You may perhaps see\r\na man asleep on the bare bench and another on the floor.\r\n\r\nAs you let the picture print itself, with all its inevitable comments,\r\nupon your mind, it calls up comparisons with what you have seen in\r\nthe unlettered countries of the world--not with the homes that grow\r\nup around a family Bible. Here the arts which bring Art home to the\r\nmultitude have found no entrance. Engraving, printing, carving,\r\nornamental work in metal, wood, or pottery, gardening, or artistic\r\nhusbandry, are graces that have not crossed this dirty threshold. The\r\naesthetics, which have had some part in the government of the country\r\nhave never developed the blessed aesthetic of home.\r\n\r\nPhysically, you find a race of great capacity. The frame, if wanting\r\nthe compactness of the French and the solidity of the English, is large\r\nand shapely; such as after a few well-fed and well-housed generations\r\nwould probably be one of the finest in the world. There is a certain\r\nsluggishness, which is generally called laziness. Perhaps it is not so\r\nmuch laziness as a lack of that physical elasticity which comes with\r\nsuccessive generations of hopeful effort and good condition, but sinks\r\naway under hopelessness, or the effects of poor food and bad air. The\r\nnatural intelligence is quick, and the manners generally polite, often\r\nwinning. The pleasant word and the obliging act are both ready. But\r\nwhen did these carters and labourers wash? Was anything ever done to\r\ncleanse these garments, partly of goatskin with the hair attached and\r\npartly of heavy cloth? We do not call raids now and then to keep vermin\r\nunder, an effort at really cleansing. And the heads of the women and\r\nchildren! Whatever the prevalent aesthetics have accomplished, they\r\nhave never awakened the sacred aesthetic of the human person, which is\r\nnot to be confounded with the lower aesthetic of dress.\r\n\r\nTurning towards the villages, the observer is again reminded of Syria,\r\nwhere he may have been led on by the prospect of a beautiful city set\r\non a hill, and found a squalid village. Self-defending construction, as\r\nin the case of the lone house on the plain, reappears here. No outlying\r\ncottages before the village, no detached ones within it, no gardens\r\nor orchards behind. The backs of the houses form a continuous high\r\nwall, pierced with small windows, constituting an irregular but not\r\ndespicable work of defence. Again you find the absence of any bit of\r\ngreen, or of flower-beds before the house, or of flowers in the window.\r\nThe gardens of Nottingham alone would put those of all the Papal States\r\nto shame, excepting such as are attached to palaces.\r\n\r\nBefore entering the houses one feels as if it would be unfair to\r\ncompare them with those of English villages in our more cultured and\r\nsunny counties. But we may take a Yorkshire manufacturing village, near\r\ncollieries. There the ground is dirty with coal slack; the air dirty\r\nwith coal smoke and heavy with damp vapours; the houses are of the\r\ncolour of baked mud, called brick; the sky is low, and more brown than\r\ngrey. Nature and art seem to have combined to make the house dirty.\r\nHere, on the contrary, the ground is as dry as a board, the air bright,\r\nthe walls of warm-coloured stone, the sky lofty, luminous and blue.\r\nNature has done everything to suggest cleanliness, and also to reward\r\nit with such brilliant effect as we can only see in the brightest\r\nmoments which summer lights up within our English homes. And as to\r\nmanufacture, its grimy fingers have never touched the place.\r\n\r\nYet under the unfavourable conditions you find tidy women, with tidy\r\nchildren, by tidy firesides. The floor, seats, tables, drawers,\r\ndresser, walls, all show that the domestic arts of ornament, in however\r\nhumble a style, are represented. The cottage child sits with its book\r\non its knee, and you are not afraid to look into the corners. The Bible\r\nand hymn-book are probably upon the shelf; and if you do not know that\r\nthe scene of the cotter's Saturday night is actually enacted there,\r\nyou feel that it might be.\r\n\r\nUnder the favourable circumstances, on the other hand, floor, stairs,\r\nwall, furniture, utensils, and the persons of the women and children\r\nare kept in such a style that one of the women from the Yorkshire\r\ncottage would not like to pass a night in the place. And you must not\r\nlook into the corners. Any stray picture which may be on the walls,\r\nonly serves to remind you, by contrast, of the wonderful development\r\nof illustrative art in England, Germany, and America, and of its\r\npenetrating influence in the homes of the remote and poor. Here,\r\nsometimes, you may find, even in the village church, prints and dolls,\r\nthe former of which in England would be considered poor, and the latter\r\ntawdry in the village shop. Yet in the same church there may be some\r\nreal work of art, which has for generations had every opportunity of\r\nforming the public taste.\r\n\r\nThe land in these Papal States, like the people, is nobly capable; but\r\nour present inquiries turn, not upon the future, but upon proof of\r\nimmaculate and infallible government, for the last thousand years or\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nFixing, then, our attention on the works of man, we find cause\r\nrepeatedly to wish that we had some measure for exactly determining how\r\nmuch progress has been made, amid these lovely scenes, by the human\r\nmind since it passed from under the dominion of Pagan Romanism into\r\nthat of Papal Romanism. At present we have not the means of accurately\r\nsettling this question, and perhaps we never shall have, though honest\r\nresearch may yet sufficiently elucidate it for a practical judgment.\r\nSo long as Christianity worked by its legitimate forces, those of\r\nthe Spirit alone, with its legitimate instrument, the Word alone, it\r\ncast out the cruel and obscene spirits of paganism, silently, but not\r\nslowly. In individuals and in families real Christians were made. This\r\ncontinued so long as the ministers of Christ ministered like their\r\nMaster, reading the Word of God, and preaching it, but no more thinking\r\nof performing \"functions,\" like the heathen, than He did; so long as\r\nthey had neither place nor name in the posts graded and rewarded by\r\nhuman powers; so long as they enjoyed no consideration but what was won\r\nthrough wisdom, goodness, and spiritual fruitfulness; so long as their\r\nwhole inheritance was not a profession, but a calling, which renounced\r\nthe world, not by cutting God's holiest human ties, but by abandoning,\r\nfor life, every hope of title, pomp, or power. So long as this spirit\r\nreigned, and whenever it again reappeared, they could point to numbers,\r\nwhom they found vile but left created anew in Christ Jesus unto good\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nBut from the time when Christianity became a public power, the\r\ncourtier, the priest, and the crowd began to flow into the Church,\r\nand carried part of their heathenism in with them. When the device\r\nof the Emperors was parodied--and as they had assumed the office of\r\nPontiff to confirm the civil dictatorship, the Roman Bishop assumed the\r\ntemporal supremacy to confirm the spiritual dictatorship--all the three\r\npaganizing forces of statecraft, priestcraft, and popular superstition\r\ncame more vigorously into play; with the result stated by Gregorovius:\r\n\"So that Church which arose out of the union of Christianity with the\r\nRoman Empire, drew from the latter the system of centralization, and\r\nthe stores of ancient language and education; but the people utterly\r\ncorrupted, could not yield her the living material for the development\r\nof the Christian ideal. On the contrary, it was just they who in\r\nearly times defaced Christianity, and permeated the Church, scarcely\r\nyet established in the Empire, with the old heathenism.\"[70] It was,\r\nhowever, on the new system of conversion that the people could not\r\nyield the material for developing Christianity. On the old one they\r\nhad done so. When the Church waits for converts till the Spirit of God\r\nbrings her penitents, she will always find material (often raw and\r\nfoul, but capable) for doing all her work.\r\n\r\nBut we find the first step in an inquiry as to the progress which has\r\nbeen accomplished challenged by the Vatican philosophy, which decries\r\nmodern improvements like the railway, telegraph, steam engine, and\r\nso on, as \"material progress.\" When we ordinary mortals say \"mental\r\nprogress\" we mean a progress of mind; but when the Pope says \"material\r\nprogress,\" does he mean a progress of matter? No; then what does he\r\nmean? Perhaps to suggest some such idea as the progressive ascendancy\r\nof matter over mind; but if so, it is unfortunate for him, as a\r\nphilosopher, that the inventions he despises represent the advancing\r\nascendancy of mind over matter. And very unhappy is it for mankind that\r\nall his influence goes to employ matter in colour, form, and movement,\r\nto make man a creature of sensation, and to stay the operation of\r\nreason and of faith, exchanging reason for sentiment and faith for\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nSuppose that an observer before passing from the valley of the Sacco\r\ninto that of the Anio looks at a historical place like Palestrina,\r\nsituated on one of the noblest heights of the land; a point whence\r\nPyrrhus and Hannibal, in succession, looked with the longing of\r\nwarriors across the Campagna to the distant Rome; and whence the\r\nTemple of Fortune, emulating Egyptian proportions, and overspreading\r\na whole hillside, dominated the plain, and held forth its lights to\r\nthe far off sea. This city has a Cardinal Bishop, and a palace of the\r\ngreat Papal-princely family of the Barberini, and yet is what a homely\r\nEnglishman would call a nasty village. If such a one had to pick his\r\nsteps up the alleys that serve for streets, in the afternoon, when\r\nthe issue of the cow-houses is flowing down them, he would rather be\r\nat home. The people are civil and apparently industrious, but the\r\nenergy of the children goes out in begging. The decay and dirt which\r\nconquer all, furnish to an English eye a plain instance of material\r\nprogress--matter gaining upon mind. The palace is neither kept up\r\nnor abandoned as a ruin, but, as if to set the town an example of\r\nthriftless filth, it is used partly for an aesthetic exhibition,\r\ncontaining as it does one wonderful mosaic, with frescoes and portraits\r\nof the Pope and Cardinals of the family, and is partly given up\r\nto--matter. Just as confidently as a skilled observer would conclude\r\nthat Middlesbrough or Cincinnati bore witness against any claim to\r\ngreat antiquity, would he conclude that Palestrina bore witness\r\nagainst any claim to supernaturally good government. How much lower was\r\nthe place when it was heathen?\r\n\r\nFrom the ridge between the two valleys, by Civitella, the stranger has\r\none of those prospects of which no previous travel blunts the charm,\r\nand no subsequent travel blunts the memory. Here he finds well-made\r\nmen ploughing, and women with busts worthy of Sabine mothers carrying\r\nstones. Looking at the plough, he finds it only a few degrees stronger\r\nand better than that used by the ordinary Hindu ryot. It is very far\r\nbehind the improved ones to be seen in northern Italy, and would be a\r\nreal curiosity to Bedfordshire or Lincolnshire ploughmen.\r\n\r\nIf the observation of implements is extended to those of the\r\nhandicrafts, it confirms the impression of want of taste made by those\r\nof agriculture. But tools are not things to make a show, and the noble\r\naesthetic of labour has not been fostered. Labour is not part of the\r\nsupernatural order, only of the natural; it serves but temporal ends.\r\nAnd who made the natural? And who dares to teach man, created in the\r\nimage of God, that the daily duty appointed to him--duty to himself,\r\nhis family, his country, and his race--serves but temporal ends? If\r\nneglected, are only temporal ends frustrated? When our Father sends us\r\nwhat fills our hearts with food and gladness, is He working nought but\r\ntemporal ends? For what is helpful to sanctification commend us even to\r\nthe stones on the head of the female hodman, rather than to the beads\r\nat the waist of the novice nun! Albeit the former is a coarse toil not\r\nto be seen without a blush by man born of a woman, yet is it a real\r\nlift at the load of life--a load natural and therefore divine; whereas\r\nthe other is neither work nor play, not tending either to lift the load\r\nof life or to cheer on the labour of lifting it, but tending only to\r\nweaken all the powers by rendering the mind a slave of charms. Least of\r\nall is it spiritual or supernatural. It is simply manipulation applied\r\nby the master with sensational skill, and in the subject suspending\r\nthought on sensational routine.\r\n\r\nHow far do the villages of the thrice beautiful Sabina exceed those of\r\nour Lake District or of Wales in that poetic property of all villages,\r\n\"innocence\"? The last thing we should do is to set up our own as a\r\nstandard. But if you hear the friars talk of the villagers, and the\r\nvillagers of the friars and police, the townsfolk of the countryfolk,\r\nthe doctor of his practice, and the priest of the refractory, you will\r\nhear mention made, with incidental ease, of crimes which, if committed\r\nin the Lake Districts of England, or in the tourists' haunts in Wales,\r\nwould fill the journals for weeks. And how often here does scandal name\r\nthe priest before all others!\r\n\r\nDo the towns in Papal territory contrast with those in \"lay States\" as\r\nthe oasis does with the desert? Suppose the observer to stand before\r\nSubiaco, seated amid Sabine peaks in the smiling valley of the Anio--a\r\nfavourite haunt of artists, and worthy of their favour. A marble arch\r\nmarks the entrance to the town; a summer palace of the Pope crowns it.\r\nA little way off stands the sacred cave where Benedict first taught.\r\nThat is the Lupercal of Roman monasticism. There arose the institution\r\nwhich became the one grand public institution of Papal Italy--arose\r\nout of purposes not only pure, but lofty, though upon plans departing\r\nfrom those both of Moses and of Christ. These made the love of God in\r\nthe individual a spiritual force to leaven the family, and made the\r\nfamily the basis of all institutions. The monasticism of the further\r\neast made spiritual life a dainty too delicate for the fireside. The\r\nChristian system made each new convert a moral agent acting within the\r\nsocial fabric. When Christians adopted the Oriental system, each new\r\nconvert was abstracted from the social fabric, was taught to turn his\r\nor her back on the family, and to call being in the family being in the\r\nworld, and renouncing the family renouncing the world. Out of a life of\r\nthree-and-thirty years spent among men, our Lord has left us scarcely\r\nanother trace of thirty of those years than this, that He spent them in\r\nthe family.[71] This convent of Benedict still preserves its celebrated\r\ngardens, boasted of as a beauty for the whole earth--including the bed\r\nof roses, the lineal descendants of those which were transformed from\r\nthorns by miracle.\r\n\r\nOn the principles of Christianity, if this place has for ages enjoyed a\r\nspiritual government free from religious error, and a temporal one free\r\nfrom moral fault, and has, in addition, been blessed with the presence\r\nof the representative of God upon earth, we shall without fail find it\r\na scene of enlightenment, righteousness, and bliss. It must in these\r\nrespects be far before places where frail human nature has been in the\r\nhands of churches liable to err, and of governments which commit faults\r\nevery day. If, on the other hand, they who have here been stewards of\r\nthe unrighteous mammon have employed it ill, who will entrust to them\r\nthe true riches, who will give to them the keeping of his soul?\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of the city, on a morning in May, the sound of chanting\r\nfloats down the street, and a procession of clergy moves along, passes\r\nunder the marble arch, and proceeds to a church in the suburbs. Then\r\nthe priests bless the fields to secure good crops, as is done by the\r\npriests in India.\r\n\r\nThe streets of the city paraded by this procession are not beautiful,\r\nand had they been steeped for a few years in a smoky, moist Lancashire\r\natmosphere they would be exceedingly ugly. They are not clean but\r\ndirty, below the condition of any country town in the Protestant\r\nparts of Ireland. They are not busy, but have a listless air, as if\r\npeople had little to do and not much heart in doing it. The signs of\r\nenterprise and of improvement which in towns under good governments\r\nsilently tell the tale, are not to be seen--signs which already, in\r\n1867, might be traced in most of the towns of the New Italy. The\r\nwell-dressed portion of the people is small, and the proportion of\r\nthose poorly but tidily dressed extremely small. A gala costume even\r\nof the poor is fine, for whatever is for effect is studiously done.\r\nMany men and women, evidently not in abject poverty, but capable of\r\ndressing up for a state occasion, are not tidy, but badly the reverse.\r\nThe number of ragged adults is great, and that of ragged children very\r\ngreat; it is hard to estimate that of the beggars, for even young\r\nwomen employed and not very miserably dressed, will take advantage of\r\na passing stranger to seek a penny; and as to the children, begging\r\nappears to be a recognized branch of street life.\r\n\r\nA young gentleman from Rome, tall and handsome, on the point of getting\r\ninto a carriage with his companions, anxiously inquires if the road to\r\nPalestrina is safe. Have there not been attacks of brigands lately?\r\nThe fact is not denied, though he is assured that all will be well.\r\nIn any talk about quarrelling, the use of the knife--that is, the\r\ndagger-knife--is alluded to as a common incident. When any occurrence\r\nillustrates the amount of confidence felt by the people in the honesty\r\nor truthfulness of one another, it seems generally low on the first\r\npoint and almost _nil_ upon the second.\r\n\r\nIf the working classes show no sign of having been blessed with a\r\ngovernment better than that of all mankind, does any sign of it appear\r\namong the trading classes? Beginning at the upper strata of finance and\r\ncommerce, a merely English eye would look in vain for tokens of their\r\nexistence. Coming down to the shops, perhaps an episcopal city in the\r\n\"oasis\" would so impress Roman Catholic shopkeepers from Thurles or\r\nTuam that they would think a comparison profane. Their evil lot has\r\nbeen cast in a lamentable portion of the \"desert,\" the misdeeds of\r\nwhose rulers, and the wrongs of whose pastors and people, have often\r\nmade the hearts of the devout in Italy to bleed. Protestant shopkeepers\r\nof Munster and Connaught would not be so awestruck but that they\r\ncould make a comparison. They would not find under the fairer sky,\r\nand the theocratic rule, what they would take for symptoms of divine\r\nsuperiority. The shopkeepers of Enniskillen and Portadown, not blessed\r\neven with a heretic bishop, would smile at the comparison.\r\n\r\nAs to the professional classes, they are nearly absorbed in the clergy;\r\nfor this is a state in which the only way to \"found a family\" is to\r\nbegin by taking vows of celibacy, and the only way to bequeath coronets\r\nis to begin by renouncing the world. The one unworldly profession\r\ncounts, among its prizes, a triple crown, scores of princedoms,\r\nministries of state, of finance, and even of war, embassies, exceeding\r\nmany palaces, honours surpassing those of nobility, gorgeous uniforms,\r\nlofty titles, revenues of enormous amount, with powers and dignities\r\nbearing a double value--one measurable by the standards of the world,\r\nand one immeasurable in the eyes of the faithful. The bulk of the land\r\nhas passed into the possession either of corporations of clergy or of\r\nfamilies founded by priests successful in their profession.\r\n\r\nThe Mosaic economy is generally taken to be more carnal than the\r\nChristian; but Moses, leaving Egypt, where the king and the priests\r\nwere the only landowners, enacted that the priests should not hold\r\nland, and though married men, should have only a house and \"a cow's\r\ngrass.\" Here, on the contrary, the priest, though renouncing the world\r\nin some spiritual sense, comes a hundredfold more into possession of\r\nit in a material one. If mind shows its dominion over land and sea,\r\nover adamant and wind, over time and space, the feat is labelled for\r\ncontempt as \"material progress.\" If ministers of the Gospel become\r\nimmersed in the management of manors, provinces, taxes, lotteries, and\r\neven of brigades, the fall is certificated for reverence as \"spiritual\"\r\nascendancy. In Israel the royal tribe was one \"of which no man gave\r\nattendance at the altar,\" and the priestly tribe one of which none came\r\nto the throne. Here the priest is king, and the temporal prince kisses\r\nhis foot. A favourite image is that of the mystic David, pastor and\r\nking in one. Here is the cure of _political_ NATURALISM.\r\n\r\nThe clergy of the Pontifical States included the two widest extremes\r\nof professional life to be found in Christendom--that of show and\r\ndressiness beyond what our courtiers or soldiers display, and that\r\nof personal meanness and social degradation to which no professional\r\nclass among us approaches. Society seemed to avenge itself for the\r\nhumiliations it had to suffer from the court priest, by the contempt\r\nwith which it treated the clown priest. We once asked an advocate if\r\nall the priests did not read the _Unitá Cattolica_, and we give his\r\nreply, not as describing what priests are, but as showing what men of\r\neducation may say of them--\"All?\" said the Dottore; \"well, nearly all\r\nthat can read.\" \"But you do not mean to say that there are priests who\r\ncannot read?\" \"Well, not precisely; but there are many that could not\r\nread a journal intelligently, so as to enjoy it.\"\r\n\r\nThe co-existence of fear with hatred of a dominant priesthood may be\r\nobserved in any country where priests have been the governing class,\r\nand perhaps, after the Pontifical States, may be best observed in\r\nIndia. The Brahmans, however, have not in the popular eye so direct a\r\ncommand over the lot of the departed as Rome has secured for her own\r\npriests, nor have they any such pecuniary profit out of the faith of\r\nthe survivors. On the other hand, no class of Brahmans sinks so far\r\nbelow the average of respectability, among their countrymen, as do the\r\nlower clergy of the Roman and Neapolitan States.\r\n\r\nBut the contempt of the Italians for the priesthood is no more thorough\r\nthan is their reverence. The man who will not introduce a certain\r\npriest to his daughters, will pay him to save the soul of his mother\r\nout of the pains of purgatory. To the Monsignore Don Juan, to use a\r\nterm of Gregorovius, he will manifest profound respect, while in his\r\nheart he scorns him. To the not worse but less successful priest he\r\nwill manifest contempt and spend some wit upon his vices, and yet, in\r\nhis heart, will fear his occult power over the souls of his departed\r\nkindred.\r\n\r\nThe worldly professions have no such lot as the sacred one. Except\r\nthe show corps for inglorious pomp around the sovereign, the military\r\nsphere for Romans is narrow, foreigners taking the lead. _Letters are\r\nno profession._ The civil service is principally in the hands of the\r\npriests. The law exists, and there are men with the titles of advocates\r\nand judges. But if we drew any idea of the status and \"chances\"\r\nbelonging to such titles, from England, it would be altogether\r\nmisleading.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Whiteside has shown how wide the difference is, and he\r\nspoke of the great city. In the little one of which we now speak, two\r\nEnglish gentlemen, who could not find room in the inn, were directed to\r\nthe house of an advocate, who played my host with assiduity and good\r\nhumour, and charged four francs each for dinner, bed, candles, and\r\nservice. The doctors seem most like men with a professional standing;\r\nand if they keep from politics, they have a fair chance of leading a\r\nquiet life in obscure usefulness.\r\n\r\nYet is the whole world called to take this state of things as the model\r\nof the subordination of the layman to the priest. \"The idea of that\r\nsubordination,\" we are told, \"is realized in the Papal government.\" The\r\nideal! This absorption, then, of the State into the so-called Church,\r\nthis suppression of king, nobles, and people under the priest, is not\r\nan abnormal and monstrous _lusus ecclesiae_, but is the ideal of the\r\nnew \"political order.\" Any one can understand it--the king merged\r\nin the prince-bishop or else a vassal of the priest; the noble the\r\nretainer and jewelled ornament of the priest; the people the helots of\r\nthe priest. That is the model. Here is realized for us the ideal of\r\n_the one fold and one shepherd_.\r\n\r\nThe English labourer knows that his son may, like James Cook, walk the\r\nquarter-deck, or, like Robert Stephenson, sit in the legislature. The\r\nRoman noble knows that the utmost his son, if not a priest, can rise to\r\nis to wear pearls and stars at the court of a priest, and kiss his foot\r\nwhen he makes a great show.\r\n\r\nThe kindly monk who, at Subiaco, shows a stranger over the Sacred Cave\r\nof Benedict, glories in far-famed gardens, which any peasant from\r\nAppenzell could tell him might be equalled in some private houses in\r\nsuch a village as Heiden. Fame sometimes draws out the dying notes of\r\nher trumpet unaccountably long. The monk is careful to enlist your\r\nadmiration for several meritorious works in painting and sculpture, but\r\nto Protestants one gem is shown only by request. It is a portrait of\r\nthe devil painted on the wall, in dark passages, and not visible except\r\nwhen a light is flashed upon it. This done, it appears for a moment,\r\nor longer, as the operator pleases, through one opening, fitted with\r\nreal iron gratings, athwart of which the demon glares out of the gloom\r\nupon the spectator. Such a picture is capable of being put to uses\r\nthat would meet the strongest views of those who call for something to\r\nstrike the senses, and through them to affect the feelings.\r\n\r\nAs long ago as the days of the man of the land of Uz, the monotheistic\r\nway of depicting a spiritual presence was, \"I could not discern the\r\nform thereof\"; and, surely, even in that remote time, the aesthetic was\r\nhigher than that of the Sacred Cave.\r\n\r\nFollowing the smiling valley from Subiaco to Tivoli, one would, in\r\n1867, probably see youths in the uniform of the zouaves, lounging on\r\na bank, near one or both of the towns. Foreign mercenaries! would the\r\nItalians say. Foreign, certainly, and some of them mercenaries; but\r\nsome, even in the dress of a private, would unmistakably show the\r\ngentleman--no mercenary, but a crusader who, in answer to the cry\r\nraised after Castelfidardo, has come from afar to fight for St. Peter,\r\nto \"die for religion.\"\r\n\r\nEven in this mountain valley the villages still keep to the heights.\r\nWhere is the squire and his generous hall?--no room here for his\r\nmagisterial office or commanding influence! Where is the farmstead,\r\nfull and cozy, warm nest of fruitful brood sure to store a land with\r\ngolden eggs? When the squire was quenched under the mitre of the\r\nabbot, the farmer was smothered in the cowl of the friar. Where are\r\nthe parsonages and manses, homes where thought-culture is generally\r\nat the maximum, and external show often at the minimum, Christian\r\nfamilies rooted in nature, blessed by divine ordinance, where woman\r\nis doing what the Mother of our Lord was doing at the head of her\r\nhouse--families holier a hundred times than the \"religious\" family,\r\nartificially substituted for nature and gospel? If from the list of\r\nbright names written up in England since the Reformation were blotted\r\nall that were first inscribed in the family Bible of parsonage or\r\nmanse, that list would be more shortened than most men would imagine.\r\n\r\nFrom the Villa d'Este at Tivoli, with its grandiose, ill-kept gardens,\r\nthe prospect across the Campagna, when the distant city and its unique\r\ndome are limned against the sunset sky, is one of rare enchantment.\r\nSuppose that on these Sabine or on the Alban Hills you ask some\r\nintelligent inhabitant if these are not the Delectable Mountains, the\r\nsummits of the true Celestial Empire, where no act of moral wrong has\r\nbeen done by the authorities for, say, the last ten hundred years.\r\nPerhaps you might hear such a statement as we once heard. It was from\r\na gentleman in the pay of the government; but he knew that he had\r\nnot to speak either to a priest or to that denationalized creature\r\nwhich Romans soon detect under the English form, a _convertito_. The\r\nstatement may not have been correct. But it was such as under our\r\nunblessed lay government is never heard. It was such as under a good\r\ngovernment could never be invented. Such a statement, professing to be\r\nmade from a man's own knowledge, one never heard in Europe, except in\r\nNaples under the last two kings; but one might hear such in Egypt, and\r\none could easily hear such, many years ago, in the Mysore, from old men\r\ntalking of the times of Hyder Ali.\r\n\r\nThe desolation of the Campagna is the true and terrible material\r\nprogress. Here physical impediments to health and life have conquered,\r\nnot being encountered by moral and mental force. What natural riches\r\nare here! If England has wealth in its coal, how much has Italy in\r\nits sunshine? How much has that saved in the last thousand years in\r\nclothes, bedding, and fuel? How much in the wear and tear of buildings,\r\nand of implements? How much has it given in ripening what we can never\r\nripen, and in ripening quickly and perfectly what we can ripen but\r\nslowly and in part? How much has it both saved and given in diminishing\r\nthe physical temptation to intemperance? This soil, this sun, and in\r\naddition the tribute of nations, poured out here for ages in all the\r\nendless forms of Peter's gain--where is all that wealth gone? Here\r\nwe are amid the riches of nature, to which successive centuries have\r\nbrought riches of tribute, and yet are we wrapped around by silence,\r\nvacuity, and fear. Sleep not here! whispers every friendly voice.\r\nWealth of matter, poverty of man! The Papal government is sometimes\r\naccused of bringing the malaria. No; it only let it come and let it\r\nstay. Like many who will not believe in invisible mind, it would not\r\nbelieve in invisible matter. The miasma was the hand of God, and was\r\nnot to be fought against.\r\n\r\nThe Papal government is also accused of bringing all the foreign hordes\r\nwho wasted this once glorious plain. It did not always bring them. It\r\nonly brought them so often that had it been done by any faction in\r\nthe heart of a country not being priests, mankind would have sunk the\r\nmemory of the faction under eternal disgrace. Now, the sickly Campagna\r\nlabourer, the thing like a Fijian hut which to him is home, and the\r\nbuffalo, seem a meet monument to the memory of Saracen and Lombard\r\ndestroying, and of Cardinals plundering, till only the grass was left.\r\nWho would have the heart to ask himself, Is this the proof that the\r\noasis of priests amid the desert of lay States, is a garden planted of\r\nthe Lord?\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, Rome is about the size of Dublin. All the Catholic\r\nworld sighs over the woes and desolations inflicted on Ireland by\r\nProtestant cruelty. Where has Rome set up a suburb like Kingstown,\r\nDalkey, or Bray? Where sown a tract of country with rich smiling homes\r\nlike those which spangle the emerald from Dublin to the Wicklow hills?\r\nWhere in the oasis could a bishop on returning to Belfast point to a\r\ncreation of wealth and beauty made in Papal times equal to Holywood,\r\nor the Antrim shore? And could his colleague of Cork dare to make the\r\npeople who look on the lone banks of the stream from Rome to the sea\r\nmourn for those who hang their harps by the \"pleasant waters\" that\r\nflow within sound of the bells of Shandon? Had the Roman Curia reigned\r\nthere, the vale would now be insecure; a wretched village or two, with\r\nskeletons and clouts by way of relics in tawdry churches, would crown\r\nthe heights; instead of villas, mansions, and cots, a monastery or two\r\nwalled up to heaven would hold the best points on the hills, inviting\r\nartists, but perhaps ill rewarding them, while nursing idlers within\r\nand beggars without. And had Rome less reigned at Cork than she has\r\ndone, a scene many degrees livelier and richer than that which now\r\nsurrounds the fair city would have noted the response of intelligent\r\nindustry to the boons of a very bountiful Providence.\r\n\r\nInside the capital of the oasis!--capital of a region where for a\r\nthousand years, at the very least, no act morally wrong has been done\r\nby authority, true bower of a peerless Eden! Let no Englishman say that\r\nthese pretensions are not to be treated seriously. We should all have\r\nsaid so thirty years ago. But now men from any nation in Europe, some\r\nblaming us, some vaunting over our return, will tell us that of late\r\nyears more has been done to accredit these pretensions by a portion of\r\nthe English clergy than by any educated class in Europe, and that more\r\nto adorn and sanction these pretensions has been done by a portion of\r\nthe English aristocracy than by any privileged class in Europe. This is\r\none instance more of the fact that not interests but principles are the\r\nsafeguards of mankind.\r\n\r\nIs the city, then, morally the perfection of beauty? Is it so rich in\r\nthe Christian graces as to accredit the claim to be the central seat of\r\nan infallible power, the one spot on earth where it is directly touched\r\nby a divine authority? The priest at once tells you how holy the\r\ncity is: there are eight basilicas, more than four hundred churches,\r\nand more than two hundred convents. Yes, but perhaps the \"religious\r\nfamily\" fabricated by teaching woman that her holy place is not the\r\nfamily which God founded, and in which every man has his own wife and\r\nevery woman her own husband, may not in operation have proved a better\r\nthing than the Christian family. Poor creatures put into an artificial\r\nfamily where duties ordained by God are made void, and ties set by\r\nHim as strings in the harp of nature to make holy melody, are rudely\r\nunstrung--a \"family\" in which many of the things called _good works_\r\nare neither virtues nor graces, but vain repetitions of fantastic\r\nforms--a family where the obedience called for is not obedience to\r\nany natural authority or to any divine law, but to arbitrary will;\r\ncommunities of poor creatures such as these, we say, may not in the\r\nlong run have proved centres of holiness. When we ask if the city is\r\nholy, we mean nothing about basilicas, or churches, or convents; but we\r\nmean, are the people like Jesus Christ, like a people prepared as a fit\r\npopulation for a sinless heaven?\r\n\r\nWe shall in reply give nothing but a statement on one side from the\r\n_Civiltá_, and one on the other from the prelate Liverani, so that\r\nneither heretic nor foreigner, nay, not even a layman, shall disturb\r\nthe testimony. The _Civiltá_,[72] after the occupation of the city by\r\nItaly, showed that one of its characteristics had been the perfect\r\nsubordination of all civil arrangements to evangelical law. _Christ\r\nreigns, Christ governs._ This motto had in Rome a worthy and complete\r\napplication. Not only individuals, but the family, the city, laws,\r\npolicy, all social institutions, felt the salutary influence. In the\r\nmetropolis of Christianity, marriage, education, instruction, the\r\nadministration of justice and charity, public and private manners, had\r\nto be regulated by Christian laws and evangelical principles:--\r\n\r\n    Such to a nicety was Rome. It was called the holy city, that is,\r\n    the city more than any other consecrated to God and forming the\r\n    expression of the kingdom of God upon earth. And the effect of\r\n    this Christian order was seen in the very virtues of the civil\r\n    population. The Roman people was not second to any other in piety\r\n    towards God, and in propriety of conduct; and not only so, but it\r\n    seemed the most dignified, the gravest, and the furthest removed\r\n    from vulgarity and tumult.\r\n\r\nThe prelate on the other hand says--and we begin at the Vatican (p.\r\n87):--\r\n\r\n    Thus came it to pass that at the Court of Rome, that is, the\r\n    house of the lieutenant of Him of whom it is written, \"_The evil\r\n    shall not dwell with Thee, neither shall the unjust remain within\r\n    Thy sight_,\" turned into a sink of scandal and a sewer of every\r\n    foul iniquity (p. 87).... It was always to me a mystery how the\r\n    Roman clergy, rich in gold and lands till most of the Agro Latino\r\n    is in their hands, with their splendid temples and sumptuous\r\n    ceremonies, with their retainers diffused among all classes,\r\n    with control of the charities, the pulpit, the confessional, the\r\n    confraternities--how it is that with all these elements of power\r\n    in their hands I hear from one end of Rome to the other the cry,\r\n    Death to the priests! (p. 87).... The particulars hitherto related\r\n    disclose [in the Court] an iniquity only too deeply rooted, and\r\n    even turned into blood and nature; they disclose sores both\r\n    inveterate and envenomed, hard to cure and hard to eradicate. It\r\n    was this that made Clement VIII say to Bellarmine, \"I have not\r\n    strength to contend with such a flood of bad habits; pray to God to\r\n    release me soon, and to shelter me in His glory.\" Also the brave\r\n    Marcellus II was accustomed to repeat a sentence of Onofrio, which\r\n    I do not wish to copy (133).\r\n\r\nAs to the people, we shall give but one word. Liverani, remarking on\r\nobjections raised against modern Italian rule by the \"good Press,\"\r\nbecause certain houses existed in the cities, says:--\r\n\r\n    It reminds me of a pleasantry of the old rector of the parish of\r\n    St. Angelo in _Pescheria_, who one day said to me that when he\r\n    took charge of the parish he found one house bad and one not so,\r\n    turn and turn about; but he soon found that they were all alike.\r\n    This editor is ingenuous and innocent as if he wrote in a land of\r\n    angels, instead of in the place where not long ago a prelate-judge\r\n    abused his office to the point of using violence with arms in his\r\n    hands against the sister and daughter of the convicts, so that he\r\n    was prosecuted before the Vicar and before the Holy Office, and\r\n    removed from the bench; but after a few years, the good nature\r\n    of the prince being overcome by powerful intercession, he was\r\n    reinstated in another judicial office.\r\n\r\nWe shall not go further into this subject than to add that one of the\r\nbitter reproaches cast upon the Italian senate by the _Unitá_ was that\r\nwhen the most noted and most respected living man in Italian literature\r\nand politics, Mamiani, said, speaking on the conscription, that at all\r\nevents the morals of the barrack-room were better than the morals of\r\nthe convent, the senate received the statement with loud applause.\r\n\r\nHowever correct or incorrect may be the views of the several witnesses\r\nfrom whom we have heard a word, there can be no hesitation in\r\npronouncing that any attempt to show evidence of divine superiority\r\nutterly fails--so utterly as to be more than ridiculous. But if there\r\nis not divine superiority, there must have been false pretensions. The\r\none or the other is inevitable. If the States of the Church have not\r\nfor the last thousand years been ruled by the representative of God,\r\nthey have been ruled by one who was himself deceived and a deceiver of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: \"I have no need to declare myself ready to repel and\r\nreject that which the Pope cannot do.

As the Court historian omits all mention of the Syllabus\r\nwhen first issued, so does he also omit to say a word of its definite\r\nconfirmation by the Pontiff on June 17, 1867, and of its formal\r\nacceptance by the episcopate. We are indebted for the details in this\r\ncase to an author who published before the events of 1870. Important\r\nas the transaction was, we cannot find that at the time any of the\r\nordinary organs of the Vatican notified it to the world. Many of the\r\nlearned disputants in the controversies which were soon to arise took\r\nground which showed that they were unaware of this decisive event.\r\n\r\nIt was Archbishop Manning who related how Mass was celebrated in the\r\nSistine Chapel, and how the Pope retired, at its close, to robe in\r\nthe Pauline Chapel. Here the Cardinal Vicar, Patrizi, followed by the\r\nwhole of the Sacred College and the bishops, presented an address of\r\ncongratulation, concluding with hopes for many years of additional\r\nlife to Pius IX, that he might behold the peace of the Church, and her\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nAs recorded by the Archbishop, the terms employed by his Holiness in\r\nreply were of historical importance.[73] It will be remarked that the\r\nwatchwords, deprecated by the Pope, are not those of heretics, but of\r\nstatesmen--Unity and Progress; and no Italian or German could doubt\r\nwhat were the unity and progress decried--\r\n\r\n    I accept your good wishes from my heart, but I remit their\r\n    verification to the hands of God. We are in a moment of great\r\n    crisis. If we look only to the aspect of human events, there is no\r\n    hope; but we have a higher confidence. Men are intoxicated with\r\n    dreams of unity and progress, but neither is possible without\r\n    justice. Unity and progress based on pride and egotism are\r\n    illusions. God has laid on me the duty to declare the truths on\r\n    which Christian society is based, and to condemn the errors which\r\n    undermine its foundations; and I have not been silent. In the\r\n    Encyclical of 1864, and in what is called the Syllabus, I declared\r\n    to the world the dangers which threaten society, and I condemned\r\n    the falsehoods which assail its life. That act I now confirm in\r\n    your presence, and I lay it again before you as the rule of your\r\n    teaching. To you, venerable brethren, as bishops of the Church, I\r\n    now appeal to assist me in this conflict with error. On you I rely\r\n    for support. When the people of Israel wandered in the wilderness,\r\n    they had a pillar of fire to guide them in the night, and a cloud\r\n    to shield them from the heat by day. You are the pillar and the\r\n    cloud to the people of God.\r\n\r\nHere the bishops learned, with the full weight of pontifical authority,\r\nthat the Syllabus was \"the rule of their teaching.\" Some explained the\r\nSyllabus as affecting discipline, and therefore liable to alteration.\r\nThe _Civiltá_ and the _Slimmen_ had always asserted that it was purely\r\ndoctrinal, and therefore above all change. In pronouncing it the \"rule\r\nof teaching\" the Pope settled that vital point. Some, again, had been\r\ntempted to think that the Syllabus might be laid up, like an ancestral\r\nweapon; they were undeceived, and given to know that it must be tested\r\nin war. Such were placed in the dilemma of having to offer resistance\r\nto the sovereign thus surrounded, or of having to observe a silence\r\nwhich must ever after carry the effect of consent. Even if they did\r\nnot feel with the Pope, that the foundations of universal society were\r\ncrumbling in unprecedented decay, they did keenly feel with him that\r\nthe foundations of his own temporal power were crumbling. Every doubter\r\nheld his peace, and the Pope's act became virtually what, as we shall\r\nsee, in a few days it became formally,--the act of the whole episcopate.\r\n\r\nThe Pope is not fortunate in quoting Scripture, often showing that he\r\ntakes glosses for the text. He imagines that the \"cloud by day\" was not\r\na pillar before the host, but an extended field of clouds overshadowing\r\nthe wide-spread multitudes and not merely the tabernacle.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: _Centenary of St. Peter_, p. 6.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOK II_\r\n\r\n_FROM THE FIRST PUBLIC INTIMATION OF A COUNCIL TO THE EVE OF THE\r\nOPENING_\r\n\r\n(_June 1867 to December 1869_)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nFirst Public Intimation of the intention to hold a Council, June 26 to\r\nJuly 1, 1867--Consistory--Acquiescence in the Syllabus of the assembled\r\nBishops--The Canonized Inquisitor--Questions and Returns preparatory\r\nto Greater Centralization--Manning on the Ceremonies--O'Connell on the\r\nPapist Doctrines--The Doctrine of Direct and Indirect Power.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 26, 1867, was the day of the Secret Consistory, to which not\r\nless than five hundred bishops from all regions of the earth lent\r\ntheir splendours. The Pope in his allocution deplored the evils which\r\nhad overtaken the Church, and, as he supposed, in equal measure had\r\novertaken all society. And now, at length, did he reveal his intention\r\nof convoking such an assembly as had not been witnessed for three\r\nhundred years. He had firm hope that from a General Council the light\r\nof catholic truth would shine forth and scatter the darkness which\r\nenveloped the minds of men; and that the Church, like the battle-array\r\nof an unconquered host, discomfiting her enemies, rolling back their\r\nonset, and triumphing over them, would spread abroad over the earth the\r\ndominion of Christ.\r\n\r\nThough journalists and bishops at the time bravely reproduced this\r\nmartial figure, the Jesuit historian Sambin (p. 13), writing after the\r\nbattles of 1870, makes the Pope say that the Church would gain her\r\nfairest triumphs by converting her enemies.\r\n\r\nThe very name of an OEcumenical Council, uttered in the tones of\r\nPius IX, instinct with personal and official hope, caused among the\r\nassembled prelates a movement of effusive joy. They felt that such a\r\ncouncil would prove a \"marvellous source of unity, sanctification,\r\nand peace.\" On July 1, assembling in the great hall over the portico\r\nof St. Peter's, with all possible accessories of form, they presented\r\nto his Holiness what they called a Salutation. This had been drawn\r\nup by Archbishop Haynald of Colocza, assisted by Bishop Dupanloup,\r\nArchbishop Manning, and others. It had been proposed to proclaim Papal\r\ninfallibility in the document itself; but this set the French prelates\r\nup in arms.[74] Though stopping short of that goal, the bishops go far\r\nin their approaches to it.\r\n\r\n\"May the unmeasured benefits assured to society by the Roman\r\nPontificate,\" say the bishops, \"be, by this deed of Thy providence,\r\nonce more displayed to the world, and may the world be convinced of\r\nthe powers of the Church, and of her mission as the _mother of civil\r\nhumanity_!\" They were persuaded that a Council would have the effect\r\nof showing that everything tending to consolidate the foundation of a\r\ncommunity, and to give it permanence, is fortified and consecrated by\r\nthe example of authority, and of the obedience due thereto, presented\r\nin the divine institution of the Pontificate. Princes and peoples\r\nwould not, \"in the face of such a display, allow the highest sanction\r\nof all authority, the august rights of the Pope, to be trampled upon\r\nwith impunity, but would see him secured in the enjoyment both of the\r\nliberty of power and the power of liberty.\"[75]\r\n\r\nThe words in which the bishops confirm their testimony of 1862, to\r\nthe \"necessity,\" of the temporal power are few and firm. They then\r\nproceed to cover the space between that time and the present. \"With\r\ngrateful feelings do we recall, and with fullest assent do we commend,\r\nthe things done by Thee subsequent to that time, for the salvation of\r\nthe faithful and the glory of the Church.\" This is a waymark showing\r\nthat the old doctrine still ruled the practice of the Court, though\r\nlong banished from its theory. The acquiescence of the bishops was\r\npractically necessary to give the ultimate sanction to the acts of the\r\nPope.\r\n\r\nThen comes the solemn adhesion of the assembled hierarchy to the\r\ncondemnations collected together in the Syllabus--\"Believing Peter to\r\nhave spoken by the lips of Pius the things which have been spoken,\r\nconfirmed, and pronounced by Thee, for the safe keeping of the deposit,\r\nwe also declare, confirm, and announce; and we reject with one heart\r\nand voice those things which Thou hast adjudged to be reprobated and\r\nrejected, as being contrary to divine faith, the salvation of souls, or\r\nthe good of human society.\"[76]\r\n\r\nSo it was done. The Pope had called for the express submission of\r\nthe episcopate to his own acts, hitherto variously understood and\r\ndiscussed, and they had given it in round terms. Dr. Manning, in\r\ncharacterizing their document as \"The Address or Response, in which\r\nthey united themselves in heart and mind to their supreme Head,\"[77]\r\nmight well speak of \"the gravity and moral grandeur of that act,\" for\r\nwith him vastness always seems to prove grandeur, and an act of vast\r\nmoral consequence this surely was. We shall hereafter see the fact\r\ntardily come to light that absent prelates were called upon to give in\r\ntheir adhesion by letter, and did so.\r\n\r\nOn either the Papal or the Episcopal theory, the Syllabus had now the\r\nstatus of Church law, and had become to all the clergy \"the rule of\r\nyour teaching.\" On the Papal theory, because it was the formal act of\r\nthe Pontiff for the teaching and ruling of the whole Church; and on the\r\nEpiscopal theory, because the collective hierarchy had not only tacitly\r\nacquiesced but openly accepted it.\r\n\r\nYet it is worthy of special remark that the Syllabus is not mentioned\r\nin this Salutation. More than two years later, however, the _Civiltá_\r\nsaid, \"There is no doubt that the prelates had the Encyclical and\r\nSyllabus in view, since in these two documents are contained all the\r\nthings which the Pope has _spoken_, _confirmed_, _announced_, and\r\n_reproved_ in matters of doctrine.\"[78] And even as early as one year\r\nfrom the time, we shall find that the double authority of the Bishop of\r\nRome, and of all other bishops, was declared to be outraged by Darboy\r\nwhen he practically disowned the Syllabus.\r\n\r\nThe next point touched by the prelates was one lying near to the heart\r\nof the Pope. They had been moved with joy on beholding the loyal faith,\r\nlove, and reverence of the Roman people for their most indulgent\r\nprince. \"Happy people and truly wise\"--_Felicem populum ac vere\r\nsapientem_.[79] So, whoever had doubted as to the Model State, it was\r\nnot the five hundred. Were they sincerely ready to make the people of\r\ntheir respective nations \"truly wise\" by bringing them to look on that\r\ngovernment as the model?\r\n\r\nThe bishops evidently knew that they were initiating a movement which\r\nwould test the combative qualities of both Pope and prelates. Every\r\ndiscerning man among them must have felt what Archbishop Manning\r\nexpressed, \"This event may be taken, I believe, to be the opening of a\r\nnew period, and to contain a future which may reach over centuries.\"[80]\r\n\r\nUnder anticipations so serious do these old men, addressing a very old\r\none, thus conclude--\r\n\r\n    Courage, most Blessed Father! Guide the bark of the Church with a\r\n    firm hand, as has been Thy wont, certain of gaining the port. The\r\n    Mother of divine grace, whom Thou hast saluted with fairest titles\r\n    of honour, will defend Thy course, by the aid of her intercession;\r\n    she will be to Thee the star of the sea.... Thou wilt have the\r\n    celestial choirs of the saints favouring Thee; those whose glory\r\n    Thou hast, with diligence and apostolic toil, sought out, and also\r\n    hast proclaimed to the exulting world, both aforetime and in these\r\n    recent days. May the princes of the Apostles Peter and Paul stand\r\n    by Thee!... At the helm now held by Thee once stood Peter. He will\r\n    intercede with the Lord that the bark which, by the aid of his\r\n    prayers, has for eighteen centuries traversed the deep sea of human\r\n    life, may under Thy command enter the celestial haven, all sail\r\n    set, and laden with richest spoil of souls immortal.[81]\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked that in this passage Peter is not honoured, like\r\nhis successor, with capitals to all his pronouns. Again, he and Paul\r\nare coupled together as if they might have been somewhat on a level.\r\nPerhaps in both points the bishops made an unconscious concession\r\nto history, but in the state of things now initiated, such jots and\r\ntittles were to become symptomatic.\r\n\r\nOne allusion in the Address, which would pass with a smile in England,\r\nhad great significance for the mind of Pius IX. It is that made to his\r\nclaim to peculiar aid from the Blessed Virgin, because of the higher\r\nexaltation which he had procured for her, and also to his claim upon\r\nnew saints whose titles he had made out. In the case of the Japanese\r\nsaints, we have already seen how practical were his views. He was\r\nfighting for the territory of his predecessors, and, finding that he\r\nhad not hosts enough on earth, he reversed the ordinary process of\r\nbinding on earth and leaving it to be ratified in heaven, and now bound\r\nin heaven, by creating \"new patrons in the presence of God,\" leaving it\r\nto be ratified on earth by a corresponding increase of forces.\r\n\r\nThe vision of these new heavenly auxiliaries dazzled the imagination.\r\nEven the professor of history in the university speaks of the awful\r\nmoment when the Pope raised them to their thrones as \"the sublime rite,\r\nduring which heaven and earth hung upon the lips of the Pope.\"[82] The\r\nexpressions of confidence in these new-made powers, as champions in the\r\nthickening struggle for that patrimony which, though costing so much\r\nblood, forgery, and intrigue, so much dependency on foreign arms, so\r\nmuch slaughter of Italians, had been retained through evil report and\r\ngood report, irresistibly remind one of Licinius when menaced by the\r\nadvance of Constantine, under the auspices of one God only. Licinius\r\nfeels the advantage he has in the numbers of gods on whom he can rely.\r\n\r\n    \"This present day,\" he, as reported by Eusebius, says, \"will either\r\n    declare us conquerors, and so most justly demonstrate our gods to\r\n    be the saviours and true assistants, or else, if this one God of\r\n    Constantine's, who comes from I know not whence, shall get the\r\n    better of our gods, which are many, and at present do exceed in\r\n    number, nobody in future will be in doubt which God he ought to\r\n    worship, but will betake himself to the more powerful God, and\r\n    attribute to Him the rewards of victory. And if this strange God,\r\n    who is now a _ridicule_ to us, shall appear to be the victor, it\r\n    will behove us also to acknowledge and adore Him, and to bid a\r\n    long farewell to those to whom we light tapers in vain. But if our\r\n    gods shall get the better--which no person can entertain a doubt\r\n    of--after the victory obtained in this place we will proceed to\r\n    bring a war upon those impious contemners of the gods.\"[83]\r\n\r\nEven if this does not describe what Licinius really said, it does\r\nrepresent the view of the early Christian, as to the heathen mode of\r\nthought, putting confidence in a multiplicity of celestial patrons, in\r\nthe lighting of tapers and such like.\r\n\r\nThe name of Arbues, the Spanish Inquisitor, has been mentioned as being\r\nsecond on the list of those now to be canonized. Professor Sepp, of\r\nMunich, long known as a Catholic theologian and Oriental traveller,\r\nsays in his _Deutschland und der Vatican_ (p. 52)--\r\n\r\n    Nothing was more calculated to degrade the Church, and render her\r\n    unpopular, or to bring a flush of shame to the cheek of every\r\n    Catholic, than this revival of the most disagreeable recollections\r\n    of history. Had Arbues contended against the burning of heretics,\r\n    we should have welcomed him, in the name of God, as a saint.\r\n    But history gives us no information about the man except that\r\n    he discharged the odious office of a Torquemada, and that the\r\n    long-persecuted Jews brought him to an untimely end. The most\r\n    that can be said for him is that he died for the idea of the\r\n    Inquisition; and for that he is to be set up on our altars.\r\n\r\nMany another Liberal Catholic blushed with Sepp. Baron Weichs, in\r\nVienna, cried, \"A single example will show you the difference between\r\nthe spirit which reigns here and that which reigns on the banks of\r\nthe Tiber. While here we speak of abolishing the penalty of death,\r\nthere they canonize an Inquisitor, covered over with the blood of the\r\nvictims whom he had immolated because they worshipped God in their own\r\nway.\" The _Civiltá_ exclaims, \"And men of this sort are to be reputed\r\nCatholics, and to make laws for Catholics. _O tempora! O mores!_\"[84]\r\n\r\nThe Cardinals of the Holy Office had drawn up a list of questions on\r\npoints of Church discipline, which was delivered to the bishops while\r\nin Rome, and afterwards sent to many, probably to all, of those who\r\nwere absent. Lord Acton points out that these questions do not touch\r\nthe depths of existing wants.[85] And Michelis seems to look upon them\r\nas a blind, to cover the real point at which the Council was to aim.\r\nThey are, however, clearly framed to elicit facts bearing on uniformity\r\nof discipline, and especially on points of administration in mixed\r\nquestions--that is, questions wherein both civil and ecclesiastical\r\nauthority are concerned; for instance, schools, mixed marriages, civil\r\nmarriages, domestic relations, and the like. The returns which the\r\nanswers would supply would be of great value in the study of plans for\r\nreconstruction, and would seem to be of more practical importance than\r\nLord Acton imagines, for the purpose of governing a mobilized clergy\r\nthrough bishops turned into prefects, by orders from one bureau, and\r\nof impressing through them a uniform movement on both institutions and\r\nfamilies, in matters affecting national law.\r\n\r\nThe five hundred bishops soon dispersed to the four corners of the\r\nearth, carrying into their respective spheres enthusiastic descriptions\r\nof the beautiful, the grand, the splendid, the superb, the glorious,\r\nthe unutterably majestic ceremonies which they had just witnessed, and\r\nno less enthusiastic hope of \"the greatest event of the age,\" when the\r\nprinces of the Church should assemble around her head to overawe her\r\nenemies and build her up anew. We do not use the epithet \"divine,\" but\r\nit is perhaps right to say that the _Civiltá_ described the appearing\r\nof the Pope \"upon the portative throne, in all the majesty of his\r\ndivine rank ... the Pope-king, the supreme representative of the\r\ntwo-fold authority which rules the nations in the name of God.\"[86] It\r\nof course celebrates the \"standards which represented the glory of the\r\nPrinces of the Apostles,\" and does not forget the \"twenty thousand wax\r\ncandles.\"[87]\r\n\r\nArchbishop Manning reminded his clergy that in the solemn adherence\r\nof the bishops to those acts of the Pontiff, they did not confirm\r\nthose acts as if needing confirmation, or accept them as if needing\r\nacceptance, or imply that they had been \"of imperfect and only\r\ninchoate authority until their acceptance should confirm them.\" ...\r\n\"They did not add certainty to what was already infallible.\"[88] The\r\ninfallibility, he contended, belonged to all the approbations and\r\ncondemnations alike--not, as some \"blindly say,\" by virtue derived\r\nfrom canons, councils, or ecclesiastical institutions, \"but from the\r\ndirect grant of our Lord Jesus Christ, before as yet a canon was made\r\nor a council assembled.\" This is a somewhat crude statement of the\r\ndoctrine which all the Irish and French Catholics we ever knew in our\r\nyounger days resented, when ascribed to themselves by Protestants. They\r\ncalled it the doctrine of the \"Papists,\" and contended that Protestants\r\nwronged all such Roman Catholics as were not Papists, by calling them\r\nso, indiscriminately. What we call \"temporal authority,\" what the\r\nJesuits have taught Rome to call \"spiritual authority over temporal\r\naffairs,\" was one point, and the infallibility of the Pope was a second\r\npoint, on which the Papist was at issue with the Liberal Catholic. In\r\nthis sense Montalembert and O'Connell were not Papists. The latter\r\nsays--\r\n\r\n    I am sincerely a Catholic, but I am not a Papist. I deny the\r\n    doctrine that the Pope has any temporal authority directly or\r\n    indirectly in Ireland. We have all denied that authority on oath,\r\n    and we would die to resist it. He cannot, therefore, be any\r\n    party to the Act of Parliament we solicit, nor shall any Act of\r\n    Parliament regulate our faith and conscience. In spiritual matters\r\n    too the authority of the Pope is limited: he cannot, although\r\n    his conclave of Cardinals were to join him, vary our religion\r\n    either in doctrine or essential discipline in any respect. Even in\r\n    non-essential discipline the Pope cannot vary it without the assent\r\n    of the Irish Catholic bishops. Why, to this hour the discipline of\r\n    the General Council of Trent is not received in this diocese.[89]\r\n\r\nThe utterances of Archbishop Manning, though sweet to the ears of those\r\nwho had the dispensing of the purple in Rome, were, nevertheless, hard\r\non those who, as children, had learned that such doctrine was no part\r\nof their creed. In his day Alban Butler had proudly said, \"But Mr.\r\nBower never found the infallibility of the Pope in our creed, and knows\r\nvery well that no such article is proposed [propounded] by the Church,\r\nor required of any one.\"[90]\r\n\r\nDr. Manning went on to declare that he had received the Syllabus at\r\nthe first \"as a part of the supreme and infallible teaching of the\r\nChurch.\"[91] In this he proved how far he went before most prelates of\r\nexperience on this side of the Alps and Pyrenees, although he coolly\r\ncredits them, every one, with having done likewise.[92]\r\n\r\nJust as the episcopate had been committed in 1862 to the temporal\r\npower, so was it committed in 1867 to the Syllabus. Whether a bishop\r\nbelieved that his assent had any constitutional effect or not was\r\nnow a matter of comparative indifference, for his future action was\r\nbound; and the Syllabus was to prescribe the decrees and direct the\r\ndeliberations of the future Council--in fact, to be its basis and its\r\nguide.\r\n\r\nThe language of Manning was treated by many Catholics as the menaces\r\nof a zealot; but the zealot knew that he spoke for the Pope and the\r\nJesuits. During the conflict now on the point of breaking out, many\r\nhonest men fought against the supposed design that the Syllabus\r\nshould receive \"doctrinal authority\" from the Council, while in the\r\nmind of those in whose hands lay their future faith, the Council was\r\nunder the doctrinal authority of the Syllabus. The Council might\r\ncontribute to administration by turning the propositions into canons or\r\nconstitutions, but could not add to their authority.\r\n\r\nThe anticipation of Archbishop Manning as to the political effect of\r\nthe doctrinal change then impending was clearly recorded, and in terms\r\nnever to be forgotten--\r\n\r\n    \"Civil governments, so long as their Catholic subjects can be\r\n    dealt with in detail, are strong and often oppressive. When they\r\n    have to deal with the Church throughout the world, the minority\r\n    becomes a majority, and subjects, in all matters spiritual, become\r\n    free. We are approaching a time when civil governments must deal\r\n    with the Church as a whole, and with its head as supreme; and a\r\n    General Council which makes itself felt in every civilized nation\r\n    will powerfully awaken civil rulers to the consciousness that\r\n    the Church is not a school of opinion, nor a mere religion, but\r\n    a spiritual kingdom, having its own legislature, tribunals, and\r\n    executive.\"[93]\r\n\r\nSome seven years after sounding this note, preparatory to a powerful\r\nawakening of civil rulers, the Archbishop, having seen some beginning\r\nof the results of that policy to which he was helping to hurry on his\r\nChurch, could say, \"I must add that they who are rekindling the old\r\nfires of religious discord in such an equal and tempered commonwealth\r\nas ours, seem to me to be serving neither God nor their country.\"[94]\r\n\r\nThe language of O'Connell, as above quoted, was not employed loosely.\r\nHe spoke as a Catholic, and as a lawyer; but, above all, as a\r\npolitician. Had his declaration with regard to the spiritual power been\r\nless explicit, that upon the temporal power might, though not without\r\nviolence, have been open to an Ultramontane interpretation. It might\r\nhave been said that he only meant that the Pope had no authority in\r\nIreland, which either directly or indirectly sprang from a temporal\r\norigin; for, in the language of the Ultramontanes, temporal authority\r\ndoes not mean authority over temporal affairs, but authority of\r\ntemporal origin. His statement on the spiritual authority however,\r\nprecludes any such interpretation. Even the spiritual authority\r\nhe declares to be limited, both in doctrine and in discipline: it\r\ncannot \"vary\" doctrine, and cannot even vary the essential points of\r\ndiscipline, without the consent of the Irish bishops. If spoken to-day,\r\nthis reserve in favour of the bishops would involve nationalism; and\r\nO'Connell's denial of the Pope's infallibility, without the consent of\r\nthe bishops, would be heresy. Archbishop Manning, with a great many\r\nothers, sought to prove, before the Council sat, that the latter\r\nposition was proximate to heresy. So O'Connell and Montalembert must\r\nalways lie under the brand of having lived and died as proximate\r\nheretics. The elect champion of the Pope's faith to-day may, if he\r\nrefuses to change, be the butt of his anathema to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\n\r\nDR. NEWMAN ON THE SYLLABUS\r\n\r\nIt was eight years after the Syllabus had been formally confirmed\r\nby the Pope, and after its ratification by the collective hierarchy\r\nhad been officially communicated to the Papal clergy in England by\r\nArchbishop Manning, that Dr. Newman treated of it in his letter to the\r\nDuke of Norfolk, in reply to the \"Expostulation\" of Mr. Gladstone. The\r\nassertions in that reply are among the most unaccountable known to the\r\nhistory of our literature. Still, such as they are, they have been made\r\nin a pamphlet bearing the name of an English duke on its title-page,\r\nand that of an English gentleman at its end. Moreover, they were\r\nreceived by our Press--and the fact is known throughout Europe--with\r\nperfect gravity.\r\n\r\nDr. Newman (p. 78) asks and answers an important question as follows--\r\n\r\n\"Who gathered the propositions out of these Papal documents, and\r\nput them together in one? We do not know.\" After no more than three\r\nsentences he adds: \"The Pope has had the errors, which at one time\r\nor other he therein condemned, brought together into one, and that\r\nfor the use of the bishops.\" On the next page he asks: \"Who is its\r\nauthor? Some select theologian or high official, doubtless; can it be\r\nCardinal Antonelli himself? No, surely; anyhow, it is not the Pope.\"\r\nFirst he tells us that we do not know who put it together, then that\r\nthe Pope has done it, or has had it done. Again, in the same manner,\r\nhe first tells us that it is not Cardinal Antonelli's, and then more\r\nthan once calls it Cardinal Antonelli's (p. 91), as if his authorship\r\nof the document was an established point on which arguments might be\r\ngrounded. Dr. Newman in this manner procures for himself a double set\r\nof premises, which he employs throughout, with frequent shifting. His\r\nargument now assumes the affirmative, namely, that the Syllabus is the\r\nwork of the Pope; and now it assumes the negative, that the Syllabus is\r\nnot the work of the Pope; and this is what the English Press with, so\r\nfar as we know, unanimity agrees to call logical.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" asserts Dr. Newman, \"the Syllabus makes no claim to be\r\nacknowledged as the word of the Pope\" (p. 80). The very heading of\r\nthe Syllabus sets up the claim to be accounted the word of the Pope;\r\nay, and his word in official, public, and teaching acts. The heading\r\nis, \"The Syllabus of the Principal Errors of our Time set forth in\r\nConsistorial Allocutions, Encyclicals, and other Letters Apostolic, by\r\nour most holy lord, Pope Pius IX.\" This claim is not incidental, but\r\nformal and capital, incapable of being either overlooked or put aside.\r\nNo man's judgments are here introduced but those of Pope Pius IX, and\r\nof his judgments not one here recited is less official than are Letters\r\nApostolic.\r\n\r\n\"The Syllabus, then,\" further asserts Dr. Newman, \"has no dogmatic\r\nforce. It addresses us not in its separate portions, but as a whole\"\r\n(p. 81). The affirmative is true, the Syllabus addresses us as a whole.\r\nThe negative is not true, namely, that the Syllabus does not address us\r\nin its separate portions.\r\n\r\nDoes Dr. Newman mean that there is a single one of the eighty\r\npropositions which does not bear the Papal brand, \"error\"? It is very\r\nwide of the mark--no man in England better knows _how_ wide of it--to\r\ntalk about different brands, some more and some less damnatory, such as\r\n\"heretical,\" \"false,\" \"impious,\" or the like.\r\n\r\n\"There is not a single word in the Encyclical to show that the Pope\r\nin it is alluding to the Syllabus\" (p. 82). This is said to refute\r\nan allegation of Mr. Gladstone, which Dr. Newman calls \"marvellously\r\nunfair.\" That allegation is, that the Encyclical virtually, _though not\r\nexpressly_, includes the whole of the errors condemned. It will be seen\r\nby any one who refers to our own remarks upon the Encyclical (pp. 5-7),\r\nthat had Mr. Gladstone read it as we do, he would not have written\r\nwhat he did. He would have written instead of it something to this\r\neffect, that the Encyclical includes the whole of these condemnations,\r\nnot by reciting them, but by clearly expressed reference. What he did\r\nsay, instead of being unfair, comes short of what is required by the\r\nevidence contained in the documents. The reference in the one to the\r\nother is formal. \"In pursuance of our apostolic ministry, and walking\r\nin the illustrious footsteps of our predecessor, we have lifted up our\r\nvoice, and in several published Encyclical Consistorial Allocutions,\r\nand other Letters Apostolic, we have condemned the errors of our sad\r\ntimes.\" This language proves that Mr. Gladstone in saying that the\r\nwhole of the Pope's condemnations were virtually though not expressly\r\nincluded in the Encyclical, was within the limits of the evidence. They\r\nare expressly referred to, and those additional ones contained in the\r\nEncyclical itself are linked on to the previous ones as a complement,\r\nmaking them a whole. In itself the point is of no consequence whatever,\r\nbut Dr. Newman has chosen to make it important, and for _his_ theory it\r\nmay have some importance.\r\n\r\n\"All we know,\" says Dr. Newman, \"is that by the Pope's command this\r\ncollection of errors is sent by his Foreign Minister to the bishops\"\r\n(p. 78). That is not all we know. We also know that the Foreign\r\nMinister did not, by the Pope's command, send it as the work of\r\nCardinal Antonelli. We know that he did send it as the work of Pope\r\nPius IX. We know that he recited in one and the same note, once for\r\nall, the language common to the two documents. 1. As regards what is\r\ncondemned--\"the principal errors of our times.\" 2. As to who it was\r\nthat condemned them--the Pope. 3. As to the official acts in which he\r\ndid condemn them, namely, Allocutions, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe next assertion we have to note is made in a strong interrogative\r\nform. \"How can a list of errors be a series of pontifical\r\ndeclarations?\" (p. 84). We reply, how can it be otherwise? What does\r\nan error mean in the language of such a document? It means errors\r\ndeclared to be such by the Pontiff; a list of such \"errors,\" therefore,\r\nis simply a list of pontifical declarations. Dr. Newman knows as well\r\nas he knows his own name, that every clause of the Syllabus is a\r\npontifical declaration that the words there written express an error.\r\n\r\nAlluding to the forty-second of the condemned propositions, namely,\r\nthat in the conflict of laws, civil and ecclesiastical, the civil law\r\nshould prevail, Dr. Newman says this is a universal, and the Pope does\r\nbut deny a universal. A universal may be denied in two ways. First by\r\nits contradictory, which may amount only to saying in popular language\r\nthat the rule is not without exceptions. But there is another way of\r\ndenying a universal, namely, by its contrary; that is, asserting that\r\nthe rule is just the contrary of what some one has stated.\r\n\r\nNow if Dr. Newman believes that when the Pope denies that, in case of\r\nconflict, the civil law should prevail, the Pope means no more than\r\nthat there are exceptions to that rule, he believes what is in flat\r\ncontradiction to the whole tenor of the Pope's language, and that of\r\nhis organs year by year--language cast in forms as forcible as the\r\ncase admits of. If he does not mean that, his repeated statement about\r\ndenying universals is, in a technical sense, incorrect, and, in a\r\npopular sense, misleading.\r\n\r\nDr. Newman's treatment of the Sentence (24) which condemns those\r\nwho say that the Church has not the right to employ force, is very\r\ninstructive. First, he says (p. 89), \"Employing force is not the Pope's\r\nphrase, but Professor Nuytz's.\" And what then? Is this phrase, \"It is\r\nan error to say the Church has not a right to employ force\" Professor\r\nNuytz's or the Pope's? Next Dr. Newman says that what the Pope means\r\nis, \"It is an error to say with Professor Nuytz that what he calls\r\nemploying force is not allowable to the Church.\" And what then? What\r\ndoes Professor Nuytz call force but force? Schrader translates it\r\n\"outward force.\" Dr. Newman does not venture so far as to translate it\r\n\"spiritual coercion.\" The whole sentence is about temporal power and\r\nthe use of force--_Vis inferendae--potestatem temporalem_; it never\r\nglances at spiritual censures in the popular sense.\r\n\r\nAt the next step, Dr. Newman professes to \"set down what the received\r\ndoctrine of the Church is on ecclesiastical punishments\" (p. 89).\r\nDoes he do so, or make any straightforward attempt to do it? Not by\r\nany means. \"Ecclesiastical punishments\" is a term of wide extension,\r\nembracing great varieties of penalty, from the deposition of an Emperor\r\nto the paltry penance of a nun. In all this range of inflictions, the\r\nsingle point touched by Dr. Newman is that of corporal punishment. The\r\nselection of this one point proves that he was perfectly aware that\r\nboth Nuytz and the Pope meant force when they said force; and this fact\r\nreduces the talk about Nuytz's sense of that term to what it is.\r\n\r\nBut having selected corporal punishment as the whole of ecclesiastical\r\npunishment, how does Dr. Newman set down the received doctrine\r\nregarding it? By quoting a passage which, under the appearance of\r\nsurrendering something, really claims something additional, according\r\nto a common usage with Papal writers (p. 89). Cardinal Soglia, as\r\nquoted by Dr. Newman, makes a merit of giving up on behalf of the\r\nChurch \"the corporal sword by which the body is destroyed, or blood is\r\nshed.\" This, however, the Church _formerly_ never claimed to hold _in\r\nher hand_, but _only in her power_ and _at her beck_, in the hand of\r\nthe temporal ruler. But, in giving up the corporal sword, Soglia is\r\nnot contented to claim for the Church in her own hand what the bull\r\n_Unam Sanctam_ claims; that is, the spiritual sword. He does of course\r\nclaim that, but he further claims that the same hand should have and\r\nhold also the corporal instalments \"of lighter punishments,\" such as\r\nimprisonment, flogging, and beating with sticks--anything \"short of\r\neffusion of blood.\" The last penalty is the stroke of the corporal\r\nsword, and is left to the temporal arm. The Church did not in past time\r\nclaim two swords in her own hand, the spiritual one and the corporal.\r\nShe only claimed a spiritual sword according to Boniface VIII; and\r\naccording to Dr. Newman she claims also a cat, a cudgel, and a rack.\r\n\r\nNeither in what he writes, nor in what he quotes, on this subject does\r\nDr. Newman allow even an allusion to appear to the question whether the\r\ncorporal sword is or is not _in the power_ of the Church. He cannot\r\nbe unaware that untrained Englishmen, in reading the statement of his\r\nauthority to the effect that the corporal sword is by some writers\r\nwithdrawn from the Church, would suppose that they taught that it is\r\nnot in her power. Dr. Newman knows that such an impression upon their\r\nminds would be a false one. He knows that Cardinal Soglia does not give\r\nany hint that the corporal sword is a weapon which the Church may not\r\nemploy. Dr. Newman himself does not give any such hint. To ordinary\r\nreaders, indeed, he seems to resent the assertion that she may employ\r\nit; but even in seeming to resent it he does not venture to affirm\r\nthat she may not do so. Much less does he say, in plain English, that\r\nsuch is the received doctrine. He engages us in chat about flogging\r\nand thrashing, and forgets all about where his Church keeps her\r\ncorporal sword--the only one we care about. Not that we like even the\r\ninstruments of flogging and thrashing, much less the instruments of\r\nother corporal pains which fall short of the \"effusion of blood.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Newman, at one time, says that the Syllabus does not address us\r\nin its separate portions; and at another, shows that every one of its\r\nportions refers to an original document, in which that portion is to\r\nbe found. These documents, he admits, _are_ authoritative; but the\r\nSyllabus, which culls out the really authoritative parts of them,\r\nis not authoritative. We can hardly credit Dr. Newman with making a\r\ndistinction of the following sort: that one is to feel bound by the\r\nPope's judgments when they lie buried in a clumsy document, and not\r\nfeel bound by them when they have been culled out by himself, and put\r\nsimply before us. If Dr. Newman feels free to teach in opposition to\r\nany one of the eighty sentences as read from the Syllabus, though bound\r\nto teach according to it when read in the original document, what he\r\nhas written on the subject may have some kind of serious meaning for\r\nhimself, though incomprehensible to other people.\r\n\r\nOne other point we would notice. \"When we turn to these documents which\r\n_are_ authoritative,\" says Dr. Newman, \"we find the Syllabus cannot\r\neven be called an echo of the apostolic voice.\" We certainly do not\r\nprofess to find that it is so. It is an echo of a voice very unlike an\r\napostolic one. But Dr. Newman means the Pope's voice. Of that voice the\r\nwords in the Syllabus are not an echo, because they are its own words.\r\nDr. Newman says that, as uttered in the Syllabus, they are not an exact\r\nreproduction of the words of the Pope; meaning by that, as found in the\r\noriginal documents. The words in the Syllabus are the exact words of\r\nthe Pope used on a second occasion, and sometimes slightly varied from\r\nthose he originally did use.\r\n\r\nDr. Newman has a passage in his own history which is not to be\r\nforgotten, and which ought to have made it difficult for him to stand\r\non points about a variation of language made by a Pope, objecting that\r\nit impairs the authority of solemn documents.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment in the life of Dr. Newman when he still retained\r\nthe freedom of a Christian man to teach the Catholic faith, ancient,\r\nstrong and true. But he was on the point of parting with it--in the\r\nvery act of swearing away that blessed birthright of his soul. He had\r\nalready recited the form of sound words called the Nicene Creed, and\r\nhad come to the point where the plunge must be made from the rock of\r\nScripture, on which it builds, into the quicksands of tradition. In the\r\nmodern form of oath which, at that dark moment, he was venturing to\r\ntake upon his conscience, the first sentences, after parting from the\r\nlanguage of the Catholic Church, the first that are the work of Rome,\r\nshift to another foundation from that laid under the old, scriptural,\r\nabiding verities. The true and noble old words, \"the life of the world\r\nto come,\" built on the living Rock, are immediately succeeded by such\r\npreparation for modern inventions as the following: \"I most firmly\r\nadmit and embrace the apostolic and ecclesiastical traditions, and the\r\nother practices and statutes of the said Church. I do also admit the\r\nHoly Scripture according to that sense which holy Mother Church has\r\nheld and does hold, to whom it belongs to judge as to the true sense\r\nand interpretation of the Holy Scripture; nor shall I ever receive or\r\ninterpret it except according to the unanimous consent of the Fathers.\"\r\n\r\nThis new thing in a creed was said by the Pope to have been ordained by\r\nthe Council of Trent. If Dr. Newman had taken the trouble to see how\r\nfar the terms to which he had to swear were an \"echo\" of those of the\r\nCouncil, he would have found that there was a discrepancy, considerable\r\nin words, but, in practice, monstrous. The Council decreed that no one\r\nshould interpret Holy Scripture against the unanimous consent of the\r\nFathers. That decree was confirmed by the Pope. It had thus acquired\r\nall the warrant of infallibility, and the most solemn guarantee for\r\nbeing irreformable that Rome had it in her power to give. This decree\r\nwas \"of faith.\" How long did it continue to be \"of faith\"? Only until\r\nthe Pope prepared his Bull, collecting the dogmatic decrees into a\r\nnovel creed. Then it was altered. The men who, henceforth, were to be\r\nthe priests of Rome found themselves called upon to take oath, not as\r\nthe Council willed it and worded it, that they would never interpret\r\nHoly Scripture against the unanimous consent of the Fathers, but that\r\nthey would never interpret it except according to the unanimous consent\r\nof the Fathers. This was another will and another wording altogether.\r\nThe latter amounts to little less than an oath that they would never\r\ninterpret it at all, except on very few points.\r\n\r\nTo make the scope of this alteration clearer, let us suppose the case\r\nof Dr. Newman himself, while yet in the enjoyment of that ministry of\r\nthe English Church which he afterwards threw away. Had he then been\r\nrequired not to preach anything contrary to the unanimous opinion\r\nof the bench of bishops, he might have felt tolerably free. But had\r\nhe been required never to preach anything except according to the\r\nunanimous opinion of the bench of bishops, he would have felt--Why, I\r\ncan hardly preach at all. Yet this vast change is made in a creed while\r\nits articles are passing through the process of being culled from the\r\noriginal documents, and presented in a collected form. In this form\r\nit was imposed by oath upon the consciences of men for ever. One and\r\nthe same Papal hand signed its infallible certainty and irreformable\r\npermanency in one shape, in a little time afterwards altered its tenor,\r\ndestroyed its certainty, reformed its scope, and then signed its\r\ninfallibility and its irreformable permanency in the new shape. And an\r\nEnglishman who swallows this camel in the creed stands between us and\r\nthe light, straining out a gnat that he says has got into the Syllabus.\r\n\r\nBut what is the real teaching, as to the use of physical force, of\r\nCardinal Soglia, who is soberly put forward by Dr. Newman before the\r\nEnglish public as justifying him in crying out against Mr. Gladstone\r\nfor accusing the Church of claiming the right to use force? Page\r\n216: \"The Church, exercising her power in the external tribunal, has\r\nbeen long accustomed to chastise offenders even with prison, exile,\r\nconfinement in monasteries, whipping or flagellation, with fine, and\r\nother similar penalties; which, inasmuch as they affect the body,\r\nare commonly called corporeal.\" Page 219: \"We affirm that in the\r\ninherent authority of the Church, by which she can coerce offenders\r\nwith salutary penalties, is certainly contained the right of awarding\r\nsuch temporal penalties as consist in fine, exile, prison, whipping,\r\nand other things of the same kind.\" Page 222: \"If a case occurs in\r\nwhich severer punishment appears necessary, the ecclesiastical judge\r\nmay not himself resort to it, but he is to hand over the delinquent\r\nto the secular power to be punished according to its will. Besides,\r\nit is evident that the crime of heresy itself was brought under the\r\ncognizance of the ecclesiastical tribunals up to the point when the\r\nheretics, being convicted, and found obstinate, were first punished by\r\necclesiastical censures, and afterwards, being subjected by the lay\r\npower to capital penalty, were exterminated.\" Page 222: \"The Church\r\nnever pronounced a sentence of blood. Even the Inquisition smote\r\nheretics with the spiritual sword, and prison, but the lay princes\r\nsubjected them to the last capital penalty.\" Page 217: \"Perhingius\r\nbelieves that the Church does possess the right of inflicting capital\r\npunishment, but that she is not accustomed to exercise it, or to\r\ncarry it out by ecclesiastical ministers and judges, but through lay\r\nones, and by means of the temporal power, because the latter is more\r\nbecoming, and more appropriate to the claims of the Church.\" What\r\nfollows would, by internal evidence, seem to be added by Vecchiotti,\r\nbut no intimation is given to that effect. Page 217: \"He [Cardinal\r\nTarquini] held that there is no kind of penalty with which the Church\r\nmay not in her own right punish offenders; and thus temporal goods,\r\nreputation, rights of office and of heritage, and life itself, are\r\nsubject to the ecclesiastical power. Otherwise the Church could not\r\ncompel disobedient rebels, or avenge herself for their crimes, nor\r\ncould she cut off rotten and noxious members from the body.\" Soglia, or\r\nrather his continuator, speaking of the moderns, Tarquini and \"other\r\ndoctors,\" and their doctrine of physical force, says (p. 217), \"They\r\nderive it from the character and constitution of the Church herself,\r\nor from the nature of a perfect society and its end. Hence, just as in\r\na perfect civil society the right of execution _jus necis_ belongs to\r\nthe lay power for the good of the commonwealth and of the citizens,\r\nso do they assert that none can deny that by stronger reason the same\r\nright resides in the ecclesiastical power for the spiritual good of the\r\nfaithful.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: Acton's _Zur Geschichte_, pp. 13, 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: _Acta_ (Freiburg edition), p. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: _Acta_ (Freiburg edition), p. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: _Centenary of St. Peter_, p. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Serie VII. vol. vii. p. 587.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: _Acta_ (Freiburg edition), p. 34.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: _Centenary of St. Peter_, pp. 12, 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: _Acta_ (Freiburg edition), p. 36.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: _Frond_, i, p. 82.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: Eusebius' _Life of Constantine_, lib. ii. c. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: Serie VII. vol. vii. p. 23.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: _Zur Geschichte_, p. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: Serie VI. vol. xi. p. 165.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: Ibid. p. 234.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: _Centenary of St. Peter_, pp. 33, 34.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: _The Select Speeches of O'Connell._ Edited by his son,\r\n1862.

Each of these Commissions\r\nhad of course a Cardinal at its head. The first, that for Theology,\r\nwas under Cardinal Bilio, a monk, and a native of Piedmont, only\r\nforty years of age, and but lately raised to the purple.[95] Rightly\r\nor wrongly, as Vitelleschi says, he is credited with the principal\r\nshare in the preparation of the Syllabus. Others, however, are named\r\nfor the same honour. We ourselves heard a member of the original\r\nCongregation for the preparation of the Syllabus assert that it\r\nwas Passaglia who first suggested it. Passaglia was a great Jesuit\r\ntheologian, who lost position by declaring against the temporal power.\r\nThe second Commission, for Ecclesiastico-Political Affairs, was under\r\nCardinal Reisach, a man of sixty-five, an accomplished Bavarian, but\r\nso denationalized in manner and spirit, that his countrymen sometimes\r\naccused him of affecting to have almost forgotten German. For some\r\nyears he left Rome to hold high place in his native country. As\r\nArchbishop of Munich he did much to supplant the old national faith\r\nby the Vatican one, and to unsettle the previously existing relations\r\nof Church and State. Under his eye the popular catechism of Canisius\r\nwas changed. The answer, \"The Pope by himself is not infallible,\" had\r\ndone good service for centuries; but now it had to make way for a new\r\none; and eventually the whole book was transformed by the French Jesuit\r\nDeharbe.[96]\r\n\r\nThe Commission next in importance was that on Ceremonies. If the\r\ntheological one had to formulate the principles on which the world\r\nwas to be governed, and the ecclesiastico-political one had to draft\r\nthe rules and frame the executive machinery by which those principles\r\nwere to be carried out, the Commission on ceremonies had to devise\r\nthe scenic effects with which the movement should, to use a frequent\r\nexpression of Roman, French, and even of German Catholic writers, be\r\nput upon the stage--the _mise en scène_.\r\n\r\nOriental Affairs, the Religious Orders, and Ecclesiastical Discipline,\r\nwere the subjects committed to the other three Commissions.\r\n\r\nA seventh, of which the official history makes no mention, was,\r\naccording to Vitelleschi (p. 26), an object of great public attention.\r\nIt was for Biblical matters, and the revision of the Index. Its\r\nPresident was Cardinal de Luca. But it inclined to a more liberal\r\nprocedure in regard to the Index, gave offence, and after a few\r\nmeetings, was discontinued. The official organs, as the same author\r\nsays, buried it in oblivion, though its labours were of great public\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe renewed preparations had not proceeded long before they were once\r\nmore interrupted by political events. From August to December the\r\nDirecting Congregation could hold no meeting. General Dumont had been\r\nsent back to Rome, by Napoleon III, to inspect and harangue those\r\nFrench soldiers who now formed a principal part of the so-called\r\nPontifical, or OEcumenical army. The national Italian party was excited\r\nby his presence and his speech. France forced them to feel that foreign\r\noccupation was discontinued only in name. Garibaldi, supported only\r\nby feeble forces, moved upon Rome with the reckless valour which had\r\nsucceeded in Sicily. The movements of the Italian Government to\r\nrestrain him were altogether inefficacious. The efficiency and zeal\r\nof the little army of \"Crusaders\" had been utterly underrated by the\r\nItalians. The Dutch, English, Swiss, German, and French youths who\r\nfought for the Crown of martyrdom were a different material from the\r\nsoldiers of Ferdinand or from those of the old Papal corps. They faced\r\ngreat odds, and did right daring deeds. But they were too few. The\r\nready French were once more called in. On November 3 they secured\r\nfor Pius IX another respite by the battle of Mentana; but the Pope's\r\nown historian does not even name the French. For all that is said by\r\nCecconi, not a foreign mercenary might have been in the Pontiff's pay,\r\nnot a foreign regiment might have been sent to his relief. Indeed\r\nthe word \"foreigner,\" as applied to any baptized person bearing\r\narms for the Pontiff, is offensive language--another fruit of this\r\ndegenerate age. In opposition to certain \"ill-advised\" Catholics, who\r\nthought it a pity to have recourse to foreign arms, the _Civiltá_\r\ncries: \"Foreigners?--the word is a great and odious lie! At Solferino\r\nthe French were foreigners; at Mentana they were in their father's\r\nhouse.\"[97] So does the one belief that the Pope is the appointed lord\r\nof the world change the lights that fall on every national movement. We\r\nonly saw the fact that at Solferino the French killed Teuton invaders\r\nof Italy, and that at Mentana they were the invaders who killed\r\nItalians. We shall find French mothers of \"martyred\" counts calling him\r\nfor whom they fell, \"our King.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the lance of Garibaldi was thus, for the second time, shivered\r\nagainst the shield of France, who would have said that when next lifted\r\nit would be in her defence, after the armies that had for twenty years\r\nupheld the temporal power had gone into captivity?\r\n\r\nThe martial value of the religious motives and principles which\r\nanimated the Crusaders, as contrasted with the Garibaldians, became\r\na favourite theme for sacred pens. The Crusaders showed by their\r\nbearing that they were \"conscious of serving the majesty of the God of\r\nbattles.\" They lost no passing opportunity of renewing their strength\r\nat the altar.\r\n\r\n    The proud lads, in full equipment of war, bowed the knee before\r\n    the altar, offered up their lives to God, and consecrated their\r\n    bayonets to St. Peter; or hastily receiving the Sacrament, they\r\n    arose with joy and seized their pieces, which had been laid down by\r\n    the rails of the sacred table. Happy he who with his eyes beheld\r\n    such elevation of thought, such constancy of purpose, such sanctity\r\n    of Christian war march triumphantly through the Roman territory.[98]\r\n\r\nOn October 8, the correspondent of the _Times_ at Berlin stated that\r\nNapoleon III had bound himself to leave Victor Emmanuel free as to\r\nRome, provided the latter would help him in case of war with Prussia.\r\nEarlier than this, in the month of September, the Austrian bishops\r\nfound themselves menaced with an abolition of the Concordat, and had to\r\nmake a formal appeal to the Emperor against such a step.\r\n\r\n    \"We have at this time of day,\" said Baron Weichs, \"to decide\r\n    whether we shall be an independent State, or whether, as in Japan,\r\n    we shall have two sovereigns; the one, subordinate, residing at the\r\n    Burg in Vienna; the other, the omnipotent Master, having his throne\r\n    in Rome, at the Vatican, or, more properly speaking, at the Jesuit\r\n    establishment.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Revue des deux Mondes_ had spoken of these words as wise, even as\r\nvery wise, and the _Civiltá_ replied, \"To us they seem to be nothing\r\nbut buffoonery.\"[99]\r\n\r\nIn November, Napoleon III proposed that the European Powers should meet\r\nin a Congress, to decide upon some solution of the Roman question.\r\nAfter this proposal had failed, his Minister, M. Rouher, pronounced, in\r\nthe Assembly, his celebrated \"Never!\"--the French would never permit\r\nRome to be occupied by the Italians. This exclamation is often printed\r\nby the \"good Press\" in the largest capitals.\r\n\r\nA fortnight after the day of Mentana the activity of the Commissions\r\nwas resumed, and invitations were sent out to the theologians already\r\nselected in different countries, to come to Rome and enter on their\r\nlabours. The Nuncio at Munich had not recommended any one from the\r\nrenowned faculty of that city, but had sought his men at Würzburg.\r\nEngland was represented by Monsignor Weathers, and the United States\r\nby Monsignor Corcoran. On October 2, Cardinal Caterini wrote to\r\nBishop Ullathorne of Birmingham, instructing him, in the Pope's name,\r\nto invite \"the priest John Newman.\" Three weeks later the bishop\r\nreplied, enclosing Dr. Newman's answer, which, however, is not printed.\r\nAccording to the bishop, Dr. Newman said that a journey to Rome would\r\nbe perilous to his life, and though deeply touched with the kindness of\r\nthe Holy Father, he believed that the latter would not desire him to\r\ncome at the risk of his life, especially as nothing would be advanced\r\nby his presence in an august solemnity of such moment, unskilled as he\r\nwas in matters of the sort.[100]\r\n\r\nThe language of Dr. Newman, as reported in this correspondence, shows\r\nthat he had but faint light on the part which mere divines were to play\r\nin the Council. Probably he was misled by history into supposing that\r\ntheir part would be public and considerable. His place, had he gone,\r\nwould have been upon an unseen commission; his share probably anything\r\nbut an important one; and, as likely as not, his opinion might have\r\nbeen asked only in writing, and upon a question of Oriental affairs,\r\ninstead of upon theology, as was that of his famous fellow oratorian\r\nTheiner. Of the very few German scholars invited to Rome who were not\r\nof the Jesuit school, one was Haneberg, who, according to Michelis, was\r\nso little consulted that he was soon back in Munich, to avoid idling\r\naway his time.\r\n\r\nIn March the Pope intimated his intention of issuing in June the Bull\r\nof Convocation; and then the purpled had to consider who should be\r\nsummoned. The most serious doubt arose as to those useful fictions\r\ncalled _bishops in partibus_. They have much of what goes to make a\r\nbishop--the orders, robes, title, and consequence, everything but the\r\noffice. Their want of this is delicately expressed by Cecconi--they\r\nhave no determinate flock; which in lay language means no flock at\r\nall. The number of these Court followers have been so increased that\r\nSepp illustrates the case by that of a government creating a batch of\r\npeers to carry some measure.\r\n\r\nBut such peers do not depend for their living on the men who want their\r\nvotes. Even the Cardinals had not the courage to assert that creatures\r\nlike these had a _right_ to sit in the Council. They did raise the\r\nquestion of right, and left it formally unanswered; but their next\r\nquestion was, Is it expedient to invite them? They boldly affirmed that\r\nit was expedient.\r\n\r\nIn May 1868, it was decided that the only proceeding to be observed\r\nwith respect to Catholic princes was that of communicating a copy\r\nof the Bull of Convocation to each Court. But should the princes be\r\ninvited to attend? This question \"was much debated among the purpled\r\nconsulters, and was negatived.\"[101]\r\n\r\nThe decision thus taken was logical, for no one is a Catholic prince\r\n\"as such\" who does not place the law of his land under canon law;\r\nor, in proper language, who does not maintain \"harmonious laws,\"\r\nrecognizing politics as lying in the domain of morals, and therefore\r\nas being under the spiritual authority. When the controversy on the\r\nSyllabus began, the _Civiltá_ had enjoyed a triumphant laugh at M.\r\nLanglais, a distinguished French advocate. M. Langlais had argued\r\nthat the Encyclical would not have transgressed its proper boundary\r\nhad it treated only of faith and morals, but that having touched\r\nthe foundations of political institutions, it had transgressed that\r\nboundary. The _Civiltá_ cried--\r\n\r\n    There exist then, according to M. Langlais, foundations of\r\n    political institutions outside of the circle of morals! outside,\r\n    consequently, of the circle of manners; or maybe, outside of the\r\n    circle of human actions.... His argument assumes that the political\r\n    order cannot be at the same time moral, or at least founded in the\r\n    moral order, and assumes further that it must be separate from it,\r\n    else he could not say that the Pope, simply by entering upon the\r\n    political order, had gone out of the moral order (VI. i. 652-53).\r\n\r\nIt is not said that Antonelli in particular took alarm. But it is\r\nsaid that fears arose lest the \"novelty\" resolved upon should prove\r\nperilous; therefore the subject had to be reconsidered in the presence\r\nof the Secretary of State. The danger that might follow the brusque\r\nexclusion of princes was so felt that the former decision was on the\r\npoint of being reversed. This shows Antonelli's ascendant. But his\r\ncolleagues had a resource. Only six days before the date fixed for\r\npublishing the Bull, a special summons, not from Giannelli, but from\r\nAntonelli himself, called together the Commission at a quarter past\r\neight o'clock in the evening, to a meeting to be held \"in presence of\r\nthe Most Holy\" (_coram sanctissimo_)--i.e. before the Pope.[102]\r\n\r\nBefore the Most Holy! Thus are we placed in presence of the Eleven,\r\nand the kings are on their trial. The Nine are joined by the two men\r\nso dissimilar and so indissoluble, Pius IX and Antonelli, in whom,\r\nas an official biographer puts it, he early discerned \"the man of\r\nGod,\" appointed as his succour and stay in his divine office. At the\r\nhead of the Eleven sits the portly, good-looking Pope, the beau-ideal\r\nof an important squire in a remote place--full of will, spirit, and\r\nself-confidence, with more art in governing than he has got credit for,\r\nat least in that domineering and deluding which avails with priests. He\r\nwould be as hilarious as a squire who never put to death anything more\r\nprecious than a pheasant, and never cursed even a gamekeeper with any\r\nintention that his curse should be bound in heaven.\r\n\r\nPius IX would now feel all the weight of his office. He was sitting\r\nas supreme Judge, to decide upon the claims of the kings of the\r\nearth. Were they worthy or were they not worthy to be received into\r\nthe Council which was to lay \"the corner-stone of reconstruction,\"\r\nthe Council in which the prerogatives rightfully claimed by his\r\npredecessors of blessed memory, but from which the Church, slow of\r\nheart to believe, had hitherto withheld her former sanction, were at\r\nlast to be openly acknowledged in his person?\r\n\r\nNo one could doubt what view Pius IX would take. The kings were clearly\r\nguilty. They had consented to the voice of their people against the\r\nvoice of the Church. They had abolished harmonious laws. The internal\r\ntribunal was reduced to a voluntary confessional; the external\r\ntribunal, in most places, was removed, and everywhere subordinated.\r\nEven as to the Supreme Tribunal, who hearkened to the words, \"Know that\r\nthou art the Father of princes and of kings, and the Governor of the\r\nworld?\"\r\n\r\nWhen the call for Trent went forth, the only doubtful crowns were two\r\nlying away between civilization and Cimmerian night in England and\r\nSweden. Now on every hand the word was, There are no Catholic princes.\r\nThat old English crown was now represented by two monsters of power,\r\nthe British Empire and the United States. Two other monsters had come\r\nup, Prussia and Russia. Spain was fallen, Poland was extinct, Italy was\r\nhostile, Austria was enfeebled, France was strong but not sound--there\r\nwere no Catholic States. The social system was indeed in ruins. It was\r\nonly by clearing away that the foundations for reconstruction could be\r\nproperly laid; but clearing away was attended with danger. The princes\r\nwere not to be invited, but they were to be allowed to claim admission.\r\nThe Bull was then and there altered in this sense.[103]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile symptoms of the coming conflict began to appear. Catholics\r\nof all classes looked forward to great events for the Church and the\r\nnations. Those who did not share the hopes of the hidden Council, or\r\nwho recoiled from the dogmas likely to be decreed, felt anxious. The\r\nPress began to pour out pamphlets and reprints, enabling all to read up\r\non the question of Councils.\r\n\r\n\"The Crusaders of St. Peter\" was the title of historical tales now\r\nregularly appearing in the _Civiltá_, which continued for years. The\r\nobject was to make the blood of Mentana the seed of a great oecumenical\r\narmy. Every incident was described with vivid conception and boundless\r\nfaith in the destiny of the Papacy, with faith too in the duty of all\r\nto rear up sons for the Crusade, and faith that those who fell escaped\r\npurgatorial pains and found direct entrance among the beatified.\r\n\r\nThe following are passages scattered here and there--\r\n\r\n    It was a sight to rejoice the angels in heaven, that of these brave\r\n    men laying down the carabine to perform the little office of the\r\n    Virgin, and then turning from the little office of the Virgin to\r\n    take up the carabine.... On the march fatigue was lightened by\r\n    reciting the prayer which had so often conquered the foes of the\r\n    Church, the rosary.... The masters of war know that on the field\r\n    of battle the last army to deserve ridicule is an army fresh from\r\n    confession and communion.... A young gentlewoman gave birth to her\r\n    first-born. \"How long it will be,\" she said, \"ere he can carry a\r\n    musket! But Pius IX can do anything. He can make a zouave even now\r\n    of my Eugenio.\" Melted by such faith, the Pope wrote a benediction\r\n    on a paper \"consecrated to him\" by the infant. The venerated word\r\n    was placed in the domestic sanctum, and in return for it \"the\r\n    zouave at the breast will do a soldier's service.\" Some weeks\r\n    later, on receiving from him a first oblation, the Pope again wrote\r\n    a word for \"his soldier in swaddling clothes.\" The family were\r\n    overjoyed at being permitted within five months to kiss two Papal\r\n    autographs. The mother wrote, \"Eugenio was asleep. I ran to put the\r\n    Papal benediction on his head and forehead. He immediately broke\r\n    out in a smile, and to me he looked like an angel. I could not\r\n    restrain my tears. He still slept, but bounded for joy as long as I\r\n    kept the blessed letters on his little head.... Should the avengers\r\n    of Mentana try their hand, the zouave will lisp his first word\r\n    crying _Viva Maria_!\"\r\n\r\nArthur Guillemin said to his crusaders as he led them to the attack at\r\nMonte Libretti, fresh from absolution, \"You are all in the grace of\r\nGod; do not count them, they will fall into our hands.\" They marched\r\ninto battle, some with the rosary round their neck, some with the\r\nCarmelite scapular on their breast, and some with the cord of St.\r\nFrancis round the loins, just like that model of a crusader St. Louis.\r\nThe young Count de Quélen, who fell heroically at Monte Libretti, had\r\njust received a letter from his mother. \"If thou art to die, my good\r\nUrban, die like a hero, like a soldier of God.\" After his death she\r\nwrites to a friend in Rome--\r\n\r\n    \"My beloved son is dead--died for his God. Oh what a comfort\r\n    is that thought amid this desolation! He fell like the brave,\r\n    defending the Church and our venerated Pontiff. Was it not a signal\r\n    favour granted to him by that Lord who is so good that He put it\r\n    into his heart to shed every drop of his blood for Him, and by this\r\n    very means to bring him to paradise, where Urban henceforth--yes,\r\n    I dare believe it--enjoys the vision of his God, and is beatified\r\n    for all eternity, with beatitude unmixed?\" [Thus it was plain that\r\n    having fallen in battle he had, as the writer of the story says,\r\n    \"seized the palm of martyrdom, as he, following St. Louis, called\r\n    it,\" and so had escaped the pains of purgatory.] \"If,\" continues\r\n    the mother to her friend, \"you go to a reception of our holy and\r\n    venerated Pontiff and King, assure him, I pray you, that I am happy\r\n    that my son has shed his blood for him.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the body arrived at Quimper, two hundred priests and a crowd\r\nuncounted from the surrounding Breton villages came, \"rather to\r\nvenerate than to pray for the departed.\" The houses were draped in\r\nblack, the black was decked with the French and the Papal flags; on the\r\ncoffin lay his sword, twined with laurels and crowned with vermilion.\r\nThe bishop pronounced the panegyric \"magnifying him as a martyr for\r\nreligion.\" Mrs. Stone, a volunteer sister of charity, went from Rome to\r\nNerola to visit the wounded prisoners in the hands of the Garibaldians,\r\nand especially Alfred Collingridge. The dying crusader said, \"The Lord\r\nhas given me the favour I asked--to die for the Holy Father. Oh, yes,\r\nmay God accept of my death and my blood for the triumph of Holy Church\r\nand for the conversion of England!\" He complained that his rosary had\r\nbeen taken away, and Mrs. Stone supplied him with her own. Alfred\r\nCollingridge, from Oxford, \"was the first of the English who laid down\r\nhis life in the Crusade of St. Peter.\" The writer prays, \"May this\r\nfirst English blood shed on Roman soil rise up before God, and descend\r\nagain in a dew of mercy on the land of Britain!\" Of Alfred's countrymen\r\nwere present, his own brother George, two Watts-Russells, David Shee,\r\nand Oswald Cary, \"all soldiers of St. Peter\" (VII. v. 155 ff.). The\r\nfather hearing from George of the death of Alfred, had only one regret,\r\nthat he could not himself step into his vacant place.\r\n\r\nWhen Arthur Guillemin fell he was unhappily consigned to a grave in\r\ncommon with Garibaldians; because it \"was not then possible to separate\r\nin the grave the friends of God from His enemies.\" Six months later,\r\nFathers Wilde and Gerlache, with others, piously sought the body of the\r\nmartyr to restore it to his native Aire-sur-la-Lys, by express desire\r\nof Pius IX. Canon Druot had come to Rome to claim it in the name of the\r\nfamily, the country, and the Church of Guillemin's birth. The seekers\r\nof the relic included an O'Reilly, a Le Dieu, a Bach, a Loonen, and\r\na Mimmi. \"You will find him,\" said a peasant, \"with a Garibaldian at\r\nhis feet.\" The first object recognized was a Carmelite scapular. \"It\r\nis like mine,\" cried an officer; \"two both alike were given to him and\r\nme by the Countess Macchi!\" Soon was seen the end of the cord of St.\r\nFrancis, worn by the deceased in imitation of St. Louis of France.\r\nAs the corpse was borne off to Rome, the people pressed around and\r\ncried _Evviva_!--Long life to him! This cry \"strange around a bier,\"\r\nexpressed a \"profound sense of the marvellous,\" and threw \"a glittering\r\nlight upon the idea formed by Christians of those who fall fighting\r\nin the modern crusade.\" At Rome, in the great Church of St. Louis of\r\nFrance, the bier was surrounded by ambassadors, prelates, and officers,\r\nincluding the Minister of War. At home, the \"precious deposit\" was\r\nreceived in an illuminated chapel, decorated, not with symbols of\r\ndeath, but of glory. \"The crowd of pilgrims from the whole of northern\r\nFrance\" thronged the town. The bier was adorned with symbols of\r\nvictory, the work of Roman artists. The coffin was borne by the youth\r\nof the town, emulous by changes to come under the coveted burden. A\r\nparty of pontifical zouaves in uniform attended. From the corners\r\nof the hearse rose trophies of the pontifical flag \"garlanded with\r\ntriumphal laurel.\" While yet the corpse lay in the illuminated chapel,\r\na new-born nephew of Arthur was borne in by the mother, who \"piously\r\nlaid him upon the coffin, as used the ancient Christians to lay their\r\nlittle ones on the sepulchres of the martyrs. A thrill of reverence\r\nwent through the assembly.\" During the funeral procession, the eyes\r\nof the multitude \"were fixed with devout curiosity on a piece of his\r\nuniform spread out upon the bier, in which was seen the rent made by\r\nthe wound\" (VII. iv. 415).\r\n\r\nAire-sur-la-Lys is not very far from our own shores, beyond Calais.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: _Cecconi_, p. 62.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: An interesting account of this change is given in\r\nSepp's stirring speech in the Bavarian Parliament on the Mering case,\r\n_Deutschland und der Vatican_, pp. 182-85.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: VII. iii. 559.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: _Civiltá_, VII. x. 161.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: Serie VII. vol. vii. p. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: _Cecconi_, pp. 370, 371.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: _Cecconi_, p. 122.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: _Cecconi_, p. 382.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: _Cecconi_, pp. 121-24.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nBull of Convocation--Doctrine of the Sword--The Crusade of St.\r\nPeter--Incidents--Mission to the Orientals, and Overtures to\r\nProtestants in different Countries--June 1868 to December 1868-69.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on St. Peter's Day, June 29, 1868, that the Bull of Convocation\r\nwas issued. According to the Pope's promise, the Council was to meet on\r\nthe Feast of the Immaculate Conception, December 8, 1869.\r\n\r\nThe language of the Bull was diplomatically vague as to the objects\r\nof the assembly, but awfully explicit as to the authority by which it\r\nwas convened. Not in an _obiter dictum_, but in legislative language\r\njointed to bear the strain of ages, a claim is set up, as Sepp points\r\nout, to exercise the authority of the whole Trinity, and, indeed, we\r\nmay add, whatever further authority Peter and Paul can lend. \"Confiding\r\nin and supported by the authority of Almighty God Himself, Father,\r\nSon, and Holy Ghost, and of His blessed Apostles Peter and Paul,\r\n_which we also exercise upon earth_.\"[104] It ought to be remembered\r\nthat M. Veuillot writes down the date of this Bull as the day on which\r\nthe middle ages died. The indication of objects, though vague to us,\r\nsufficed for the initiated. _Ce qui se Passe au Concile_ says (p. 9)--\r\n\r\n    The Pope repeatedly intimates that the Church has the right \"to\r\n    redress the errors which turn _civil_ society upside down, ...\r\n    to preserve the nations from bad books and pernicious journals,\r\n    and from those teachers of iniquity and error to whom the unhappy\r\n    youth are confided whose education is withdrawn from the clergy;\r\n    ... to defend justice, ... to assure the progress and solidity\r\n    of the human sciences.\" This somewhat confounds things spiritual\r\n    and temporal; but those political allusions drowned in the usual\r\n    digressions of Pontifical documents, passed unobserved.\r\n\r\nIf they passed unobserved in Roman Catholic countries, where\r\njournalists did know a little of the modes of pontifical speech, how\r\nmuch more in countries like England and America, where at that time it\r\nwas considered unintelligent to speak or write upon the subject from\r\nknowledge, the proper thing being a serene superiority to study, and a\r\njudicious expression of opinions caught in the air.\r\n\r\nTo obviate the objection that the assembly would be only a synod of the\r\nWestern Church, and not an OEcumenical Council, the Bull was followed\r\nby Letters Apostolic addressed to all prelates of the Oriental Churches\r\nnot holding communion with Rome.[105] Until the Vatican Council these\r\nwere regarded only as schismatics, not as heretics. Therefore the Pope\r\ninvited them to come, and by submitting to the See of Rome to complete\r\nthe union. This invitation was dated September 8; and on the 13th of\r\nthat month a \"paternal letter\" went forth, to Protestants and other\r\nnon-Catholics. All these, from Anglican Ritualists down to the smallest\r\nsects, were grouped together, not being called to take any part in the\r\nCouncil, but to seize the occasion of joining the Pope's Church by\r\nrenouncing their heresies and submitting to his authority.\r\n\r\nAlthough the approach of the Council excited little attention in\r\nProtestant countries, it began to be discussed in Roman Catholic ones\r\nwith an interest which rapidly warmed to excitement. The tremendous\r\nsignificance attached by Ultramontane authorities to the Bull,\r\nespecially to the non-invitation of princes, and to the coming struggle\r\nwith the Modern State, was enough to rouse Catholics who did not\r\nsympathize with the aims indicated. The _Civiltá_ put the alternative\r\nas between the end of the world or its salvation by the Council.\r\n\"Either, in the inscrutable designs of God, human society is destined\r\nto perish, and we are close upon the supreme cataclysm of the last day,\r\nor the salvation of the world is to be looked for from the Council and\r\nfrom nothing else.\"[106] Language like this is not to be smiled at\r\nwhen it goes to the heart of perhaps half a million of ecclesiastics,\r\neach one of whom transmits the impression through a wide circle. The\r\nfollowing passage in the same article may be laid to heart. A good part\r\nof it is quoted by _Janus_, with the remark that it needs but a step\r\nfurther to declare the Pontiff an incarnation of God.\r\n\r\n    The Pope is not a power among men to be venerated like another.\r\n    But he is a power altogether divine. He is the propounder and\r\n    teacher of the law of the Lord in the whole universe; he is the\r\n    supreme leader of the nations to guide them in the way of eternal\r\n    salvation; he is the common father and universal guardian of\r\n    the whole human species in the name of God.... The treasures of\r\n    revelation, the treasures of truth, the treasures of righteousness,\r\n    the treasures of supernatural graces upon earth, have been\r\n    deposited by God in the hands of one man, who is the sole dispenser\r\n    and keeper of them. The life-giving work of the divine incarnation,\r\n    work of wisdom, of love, of mercy, is ceaselessly continued in\r\n    the ceaseless action of one man, thereto ordained by Providence.\r\n    This man is the Pope. This is evidently implied in his designation\r\n    itself--The Vicar of Christ. For if he holds the place of Christ\r\n    upon earth, that means that he continues the work of Christ in the\r\n    world, and is in respect of us what Christ would be were He here\r\n    below, Himself visibly governing the Church.... It is, then, no\r\n    wonder if the Pope, in his language, shows that the care of the\r\n    whole world is his, and if, forgetting his own peril, he thinks\r\n    only of that of the faithful nations. He sees aberrations of mind,\r\n    passions of the heart, overflowing vices; he sees new wants, new\r\n    aspirations; and holding out to the nations a helping hand, with\r\n    the tranquillity of one securely seated on the throne given him by\r\n    God, he says to them, Draw nigh to me, and I will trace out for you\r\n    the way of truth and charity which alone can lead to the desired\r\n    happiness.[107]\r\n\r\nSuch divines as held that the proper work of a General Council was to\r\nheal schisms or combat heresies, remarked on the absence of both. Such\r\nas were unwilling to see the Church straining after temporal power, and\r\nplacing herself in antagonism to freedom and light, could ill conceal\r\ntheir anxiety. But the Jesuits everywhere hailed the dawning of a\r\nwonderful day.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, October 17, 1868, the Abbé Testa, accompanied by three\r\nother priests, went to the palace of the Patriarch of Constantinople,\r\nbearing the Pope's letter to the Oriental bishops. The Vicar-General\r\nreceived the four Latin priests, and introduced them to his Holiness\r\nthe Patriarch, whose hand they kissed. The Patriarch, on his part,\r\nembraced them, and expressed his pleasure at seeing them. The Abbé\r\nTesta then drew a richly adorned little book from his pocket and\r\noffered it to the Patriarch, while one of his brethren told his\r\nHoliness, in Greek, that they had come to invite him to attend the\r\nOEcumenical Council, and begged him to receive the letter of invitation.\r\n\r\nHis Holiness motioned to the Abbé Testa to lay the little book down\r\nnear him, and said, \"Had not the _Giornale di Roma_ published the\r\nletter whereby his Holiness summons us to Rome to a Council, which he\r\ncalls oecumenical, and had we not thus learned the object and contents\r\nof the letter, and also the principles of his Holiness, we should have\r\nreceived a communication from the Patriarch of old Rome with the utmost\r\npleasure, in hope of finding some change in his mode of thinking. As,\r\nhowever, this invitation is in the journals, and as his Holiness has\r\nproclaimed views in direct opposition to the principles of the orthodox\r\nChurches of the East, we declare to you, Reverend Fathers, with grief\r\nand at the same time with sincerity, that we cannot receive either such\r\nan invitation or such a letter, which only assert principles opposed\r\nto the spirit of the Gospel and to the declarations of the OEcumenical\r\nCouncils and of the Holy Fathers.\"\r\n\r\nThe Patriarch proceeded to refer to the Pope's former advances, and\r\ndelicately hinted that when they had objected that he held principles\r\nwhich were to be regretted, his reply showed that he was so much pained\r\nthat it was better not to put him to grief a second time. \"In short, we\r\nlook for the true settlement of the question to history. Ten centuries\r\nago there was one Church, confessing the same faith in East and West,\r\nin old Rome and new Rome. Let us go back for that period, and let us\r\nsee who has added and taken away. Let us suppress innovations, if\r\nsuch there are, and then shall we imperceptibly find ourselves at that\r\npoint of Catholic orthodoxy from which Rome was pleased gradually to\r\ndiverge in the earlier centuries, ever widening the gulf of separation\r\nmore and more by new dogmas and definitions which depart from the holy\r\ntraditions.\"\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Testa asked what principles his Holiness spoke of.\r\n\r\n\"Without entering into minute points,\" replied the Patriarch, \"we\r\ncan never admit that wherever the Church of our Saviour extends upon\r\nearth any Chief Bishop exists in the midst of her except our Lord, or\r\nthat there is a Patriarch who is infallible whenever he speaks _ex\r\ncathedrâ_, who is exalted above the OEcumenical Councils, to which\r\nalone infallibility attaches, seeing that they always held to holy\r\nscripture and apostolic tradition.\"\r\n\r\nThe Abbé referred to the Council of Florence, and received a full and\r\ncourteous answer. The Patriarch at last said, \"If you would see that\r\nunion realized which we all desire, place yourselves on the ground\r\nof history and of the General Councils; or, if that is too hard upon\r\nyou, let us all pray to God for peace to the world and prosperity and\r\nunion to the Church. For the moment, we declare, with pain, that this\r\ninvitation is fruitless and this circular of no effect.\"\r\n\r\nThe four Latins urged that prayer alone did not suffice; if one was\r\nsick we not only prayed but employed means of cure. \"When the sickness\r\nis spiritual,\" replied the Patriarch, \"the Lord alone knows who is the\r\nsick man, how he suffers, what is the root of the malady, and what the\r\nreal cure. I say again there is urgent necessity for ceaseless prayer\r\nto the Lord of the whole earth, that He may guide all to conclusions\r\nwell pleasing to God.\"\r\n\r\nThe Patriarch then directed the Vicar-General to hand back the little\r\nbook, and the four abbés took their leave, accompanied to the stair by\r\nthe Vicar-General.[108]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of this interview, the _Stimmen aus Maria Laach_ said,\r\n\"Neither by his words nor his deeds did the Patriarch manifest polish,\r\ntheological science, or ecclesiastical education.\"[109]\r\n\r\nThe invitation was rejected by the Metropolitan of Ephesus, and the\r\nBishops of Varna and Thessalonica. The Metropolitan of Chalcedon\r\nwrote upon it _Epistrephete_--\"Be converted\"--and returned it. The\r\nPatriarch of Antioch sent the letter back, and his ten bishops did\r\nthe same. So also the orthodox Greek Patriarch of Jerusalem and his\r\nbishops (_Friedberg_, p. 70). The Bishop of Thessalonica assigned four\r\nreasons, the last of which called forth a laboured reply from the\r\nJesuits of Laach. \"The Pope is a king,\" said the Oriental, \"and wields\r\nthe sword, which is contrary to the gospel.\" The reply was that the\r\nexistence of the small but heroic army of the Pope was not due so much\r\nto any will of his as to the nature of his office as chief shepherd\r\nof the universal Church. The army and the temporal power, \"without\r\nwhich this office cannot exist,\" were manifestly necessary. But then\r\nthe \"schismatical bishop\" asks if bearing the sword is not contrary to\r\nthe gospel. No; for in the very words of the gospel Christ allowed the\r\napostles to bear two swords.\r\n\r\nHaving reached this practical point in the teaching of Boniface VIII,\r\nthe writer goes on to show that Peter was not told to cast his sword\r\naway, but only to put it up into the sheath; which clearly meant that\r\nhe was to bear it. If he was reproved for using it, that was because,\r\nthough he had asked permission to do so, he had not yet received it;\r\nfor, in fact, at that point of time, the supreme power promised to\r\nPeter had not been actually bestowed upon him. But seeing that he was\r\ntold to keep the sword, are we to suppose that when he did become\r\nruler, he and his successors for all time were to keep it hanging\r\nat their sides, as a useless weight? Certainly not; \"he beareth not\r\nthe sword in vain.\" The writer would probably have called any one an\r\ninfidel who expected a literal fulfilment of the words \"all they that\r\ntake the sword shall perish with the sword.\"\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the reception given in the East to the Bull, consolation\r\nwas drawn from the fact that the Armenian Patriarch in Constantinople\r\nhad raised the brief to his forehead. But the Catholikos of the same\r\nChurch in the See of Etschmiazin rejected it with decision. The\r\nill-success of these overtures displeased the \"good Press.\" Pius IX had\r\nbeen flattered into the belief that he had in great measure \"restored\"\r\nthe ascendancy of the Pontiff over the East. Even Archbishop Manning\r\nhad said enough in print to show that he came back from Rome in 1867\r\nwith some such idea, and prelates of more experience had done the same.\r\n\r\nRepresentations as to the readiness of Protestants to submit, had led\r\nto the letter to Protestants. Bishop Martin of Paderborn had strong\r\nhopes of those in Germany, and set store by some odd letters, said\r\nto be from Protestant clergymen, which, however, seem to be either\r\nspurious, or from men not likely to lead anybody.[110] Archbishop\r\nManning, after several sentences coloured by a pontifical imagination,\r\nhad said, \"The Council of Trent fixed the epoch after which\r\nProtestantism never spread. The next General Council will probably date\r\nthe period of its dissolution.\"[111]\r\n\r\nBetween the date of the Bull of Convocation and that of the invitation\r\nto the Orientals, the Pope performed two journeys to the Alban Hills,\r\nwhich were celebrated by Court journalists. At Rocca di Papa, where\r\nHannibal is said to have pitched his tents, the little army of his\r\nHoliness was, after modern usage, encamped. The Pontiff went on purpose\r\nacross the Campagna and up the hills, passed through the ranks of his\r\ndefenders, and himself celebrated Mass for their benefit. When his next\r\nbirthday was celebrated, the zouaves made a special display in the\r\nPiazza of St. Peter's, of which the _Civiltá_ gives a long but lively\r\ndescription. The last formation mentioned is to us new in military\r\nevolutions. The zouaves \"formed so as to make the letters composing the\r\naugust name Pius IX.\"[112]\r\n\r\nEver since 1860 the preaching of \"taking up the cross,\" of the glory\r\nof \"dying for religion,\" and of the pure, bright martyrdom of falling\r\non the field for St. Peter, had been rather heavy work. Now the gleam\r\nof victory at Mentana lighted up the future. Vistas long and luminous\r\nled the eye of the fighting sons of Loyola away to other scenes,\r\nwhere John VIII as Admiral, or John X as General, or Pius V rejoicing\r\nover Lepanto, with other martial glories of the Papacy, paled before\r\nwhat the Virgin and St. Michael were about to bring to pass. Loud and\r\nringing sounded forth to the faithful the call to the crusade of St.\r\nPeter. The youth of the Catholic world were assured that not the fall\r\nof Richmond nor the capture of Sebastopol, not Solferino nor Sadowa,\r\nhad moved human society as did the tidings from Mentana. Stories true\r\nand often very touching were mixed with fables and with ecstasies.\r\n\r\nThe tales were those of youths from the noblest houses and from the\r\nlowliest cots. The young Duke de Blacas \"dedicated his sword to the\r\ntomb of St. Peter, as his forefathers dedicated theirs to the tomb of\r\nChrist.\" In his death youths are to see the martyr palm for which it\r\nis noble to pant, and mothers are to see a privilege which they might\r\nwell seek in prayer. Peter Jong, a poor Dutch lad, only son of his\r\nmother, a widow, who gave him up rejoicing as if God had granted her\r\ngreat grace, fell, it is said, after having slain fourteen Italians. He\r\nreceives this tribute: \"For St. Peter he inflicted many just deaths;\r\nfor St. Peter he worthily met his own.\" It is told how the King of\r\nHolland keeps Jong's photograph in his portfolio, and shows it to other\r\nintending crusaders as an encouragement. Another Dutch youth writes:\r\n\"Mamma, blessed is he who sheds the last drop of his blood. The martyrs\r\nof all the centuries descend to meet him and to conduct him to heaven.\"\r\nThis, though Protestants may not know it, is spiritual warfare! for\r\n\"to defend the Church of Christ is a spiritual object.\" One proof\r\nconstantly alleged that bayonet and ball used for St. Peter are to\r\nre-establish truth and righteousness is, \"This is the victory that\r\novercometh the world, even our faith.\"\r\n\r\nThe young Duke de Blacas, not having been in action, seemed in dying to\r\nthink that he should not escape purgatory. Care, however, is taken,\r\nin a studiously written biography of a Goldoni who also died before\r\nbattle, to show that in point of martyrdom, as to the old crusaders, no\r\ndifference was made by St. Bernard and St. Catherine of Siena between\r\nthose who died in battle and those who died in the service. Also, that\r\nno difference had been made between these two classes of the crusaders\r\nof St. Peter by Pius IX. He had comforted a father who regretted that\r\nhis son had not fallen in battle, by telling him that he had \"the\r\nsupreme\" consolation, because the son had died in the service of the\r\nHoly See. And he had, in his solemn Allocution, compared both classes\r\nalike to the martyred Maccabees. The father of Goldoni, pictured as a\r\ndevout and humane physician, is represented as often putting up the\r\nprayer for his only son, \"Oh that God would inspire him to take up the\r\ncross!\" Young Goldoni was a diligent reader of the _Unitá Cattolica_\r\nand the _Civiltá_, from which \"sources of religious and of pure\r\nintellectual culture he drew a generous and daring spirit.\" Though he\r\ndied unhappily before battle, his biographer sees him seated among the\r\ncelestial martyrs, between the Duke de Blacas and the Count Zileri de\r\nVerme, with whom do rejoice and glory others who died at a distance\r\nfrom the fight. When Goldoni received his \"call\" to the crusade, he\r\nstarted in haste. \"It seemed as if the Spirit of God carried him.\"\r\nThe Archbishop of Modena specially blessed \"our young crusader.\" He\r\nthen received the Sacrament, and so \"heart to heart with Jesus Christ\r\nconsecrated his life to Holy Church.\" Moreover, in parting, \"the young\r\ncavalier of Jesus Christ put upon his bosom, as if a breastplate, an\r\nimage of Mary.\" The night before leaving home he, \"in the manner of\r\nthe old crusaders,\" knelt at his father's knee and asked his blessing.\r\nWhile the father \"shed upon him the holy water and the prayer,\" Antonio\r\nburst into weeping.\r\n\r\nArrived in Rome, Goldoni sought a Jesuit to \"govern his soul.\" The\r\nJesuit made allusion to the dangers of his new life. \"I have made up\r\nmy mind to be a martyr for the Holy See,\" replied Goldoni. \"The Holy\r\nFather has declared the temporal power necessary to the spiritual.\r\nTherefore, fighting and dying for the temporal power, I should\r\nindirectly be a martyr for our holy religion.\" The Jesuit was overcome\r\nat hearing these generous sentiments from a youth so superior. Two days\r\nafter, the Jesuit and Goldoni met \"in the tribunal of penitence.\"\r\n\r\nGoldoni soon caught a fever, and in the hospital often confessed. On\r\nthe Feast of St. John Berchmans[113] he declared that he had obtained\r\nfrom the saint the grace to be with him in Paradise on the day of the\r\nAssumption of the Virgin. He reiterated that he should on the day of\r\nthe Assumption go to heaven to see the Madonna and St. John Berchmans.\r\nHis good father, called from Modena, arrived in time to bless and pray\r\nfor his departing Antonio. At the last moment he left him, for it\r\nwould seem that those around thought that the presence of the earthly\r\nfather would come between him and the heavenly Father. So he lay, with\r\nhis lustrous eyes fixed on heaven, as if, says the chaplain, \"he was\r\nawaiting the appearance of his John Berchmans, who was to present him\r\nat the throne of the great Virgin.\" At seven o'clock on the morning of\r\nthe Assumption he passed away.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: _Acta_, p. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: Archbishop Manning gave reasons for looking upon the\r\nmotive here assigned as \"a transparent error.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: Serie VII. vol iii. p. 264.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: Serie VII. vol. iii. pp. 259, 260.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: _Friedberg Aktenstücke_, pp. 250-53.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: _Neue Folge, Erstes Heft_, pp. 72, 73.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: These productions are published by\r\nFriedrich--_Tagebuch_, p. 453 ff.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: _The Centenary of St. Peter, and the General Council_,\r\np. 90.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: _Civiltá_, Serie VII. vol. v. p. 234.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: Technically, Berchmans seems to be only a beatified, not\r\na saint.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPrinces, Ministers, and their Confessors--Montalembert's part in the\r\nRevival--His Posthumous Work on Spain--Indignation against the New\r\nAssumptions--Debate of Clergy in Paris on the Lawfulness of Absolving\r\na Liberal Prince or Minister--Wrath at Rome--True Doctrines taught to\r\nDarboy and his Clergy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn proportion as this Popery of physical force came into view, did the\r\nmental stress of Catholics who had put their faith in finer forces\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nChateaubriand, who played a brilliant part in the Catholic reaction\r\nwhich followed the great French Revolution, especially in that phase of\r\nthe movement which aimed at linking together, in the imagination, Rome\r\nand ideas and hopes now dear to mankind, left a work, at his death,\r\nwhich he called _Memoirs from Beyond the Grave_--_Memoires d'outre\r\nTombe_. Montalembert, who played a still more brilliant part in the\r\nCatholic reaction which followed the Revolution of 1830, also left\r\nbehind him a work, to appear after his death. In that work we can trace\r\nthe pains of a representative mind, showing what must have been those\r\nof multitudes at the time of which we now write.\r\n\r\nMontalembert saw, in \"the absolutist politics, the retrospective\r\nfanaticism, the embittered hostility to all modern ideas and\r\ninstitutions, flaunted everywhere by the religious press,\"[114] not\r\nonly a blot on the cause, which had been his life-passion--a passion\r\nof feminine flame but of masculine vigour--but also a personal\r\nwound. It made his past look like a well-played hypocrisy. He had\r\nenthusiastically and victoriously argued for Catholicism under plea\r\nof liberty. \"I neither can nor will,\" he cries, \"keep silence, as\r\nto the monstrous articles published this very year (1868) by the\r\n_Civiltá Cattolica_ against liberty in general, and precisely against\r\nthose Liberal Catholics who, like me, have had the _naïveté_ in the\r\nParliamentary tribune to assert the rights of the Jesuits, and cause\r\nthem to triumph in the name of liberty.\"[115]\r\n\r\nOn the second anniversary of that mysterious Thursday in February\r\n1848, when King Louis Philippe, of the Tuileries, suddenly changed\r\ninto Mr. Smith in a street cab on the way to exile, Montalembert and\r\nThiers pleaded in the National Assembly for \"freedom of instruction\" on\r\nbehalf of the Jesuits. \"It was only,\" says our orator, \"in the name of\r\nliberty, of modern constitutions, of modern liberty, of the liberty of\r\nconscience, of the Press, and of the tribune, that we made the claim.\"\r\nHe adds that the victory was won only by Thiers brandishing the text\r\nof the Republican constitution in the face of the furious Mountain, a\r\nconstitution proclaiming equal freedom of worship and association to\r\nall. The italics are his own--\r\n\r\n    \"We were all wrong, it is clear. In sound theology M. Renan alone\r\n    was right--he and the like of him who maintained that Catholicism,\r\n    and above all, the Jesuits, were absolutely incompatible with\r\n    liberty. Only--we ought to have been told it _then_. It was _then_,\r\n    and not now, that they ought to have taught us that liberty was a\r\n    _plague_, instead of taking advantage of it, and that by our help,\r\n    in order, twenty years later, to come insulting and repudiating\r\n    both it and us, at one and the same time.\r\n\r\n    I have long passed the age of disappointments and passionate\r\n    emotions, but I declare on reading these bare-faced palinodes\r\n    I have reddened to the white of my eyes, and shivered to the\r\n    ends of my nails. I am no longer child enough to complain of the\r\n    inconsistencies of men in general, or of Jesuits in particular, but\r\n    I loudly say that this tone of the puppy and the pedant (_ce ton de\r\n    faquin et de pédagogue_), employed towards old defenders, all of\r\n    whom are not dead, and in respect of old struggles, which may be\r\n    renewed to-morrow, does not become either monks or reputable men.\r\n    It may be perfectly orthodox. In matters of theology I am no judge,\r\n    but I think I am a judge in a matter of honour and decency; and I\r\n    declare it is perfectly indecent.\"\r\n\r\nWe give but one more extract from this unconscious palinode of the\r\nhigh-souled Montalembert, who could not even then see that the Liberal\r\nCatholicism of his ideal was a generous phantasy, irreconcilable\r\nwith the Popery of Rome, as much so as was his beloved parliamentary\r\nsystem in politics with the Second Empire. No more could he see that\r\nPope and Jesuit were true to themselves in urging their old and\r\nfixed principles, and had been equally true to themselves in using\r\ninstruments like him so long as they struck or stayed their hand at\r\n\"the beck of the priest,\" and in disowning them so soon as they set up\r\nto keep a conscience for themselves, \"as if the rod should shake itself\r\nagainst them that lift it up.\" He and his friend Lacordaire carried to\r\nRome the large ideas of a great people, and bathed the quaint figures\r\nof the Curia, and the quaint objects of the city, in the tropical light\r\nof their own genius, just as Lamartine had done with the withered\r\nremnants of the East. After such pictures as Montalembert had drawn in\r\nhis books, and his speeches, of his ideal Catholic Church, it must have\r\nbeen mortifying to have, in age and sickness, to write as follows--\r\n\r\n    \"Certainly, a strange way has been invented of serving religion, of\r\n    making the modern world accept, comprehend, and love it. One might\r\n    say that they treat the Church like one of those wild beasts that\r\n    are carried about in menageries. Look at her, they seem to say, and\r\n    understand what she means, and what is her real nature! To-day, she\r\n    is in a cage, tamed and broken in, by force of circumstances. She\r\n    can do no harm for the present; but understand that she has paws\r\n    and tusks, and if ever she is let loose you will be made to know\r\n    it\" (p. 641).\r\n\r\nAs he wrote this sad passage, in all probability there would rise\r\nbefore his imagination one of the most memorable scenes in the life of\r\nany orator. When glorifying the return of the Pope to Rome, restored\r\nby French force, and deprecating any attempt at a conflict with the\r\nChurch, he said that from any such conflict only dishonour could\r\nresult, as to a strong man would result dishonour from a combat with\r\na woman. And then, turning upon his audience, he said, \"The Church is\r\nmore than a woman; the Church is a mother,\" with a gush and a power\r\nwhich produced such a scene as perhaps has hardly ever been witnessed\r\nin any parliamentary assembly. And both ideals were quite sincere. The\r\nChurch of Montalembert's imagination was a mother; the Church of the\r\n_Civiltá Cattolica_ is a dam, holding to her young while they continue\r\nin sheer dependence, treating them as strangers when they can take\r\ncare of themselves. His Church is the dream of an exceptional few, the\r\nChurch of the _Civiltá_ is the strong reality.\r\n\r\nThe articles which called forth this protestation of Montalembert,\r\nwere among the most curious even of the _Civiltá_. They dealt with\r\nFrance--Paris and Darboy. On February 5, 1868, the Archbishop of Paris\r\nheld a conference of his clergy in the Church of Saint Rocque, and\r\nthere argued the following case of conscience. By some exceptional feat\r\nof the worst of all evil genii, Publicity, the discussion, and its\r\nresult, were reported in the _Patrie_; and this indiscretion caused\r\nthe world for once to gain a real peep into the consultations in the\r\njudges' chambers, behind the _internal tribunal_.\r\n\r\n    \"A man engaged in politics,\" says the case of conscience, \"declares\r\n    to his confessor that he has no intention of renouncing the\r\n    doctrines which prevail among modern nations, the principal points\r\n    of which are, liberty of worship, liberty of the Press, and the\r\n    action of the State in mixed affairs. The confessor asks if he is\r\n    to grant absolution to a penitent in this state of mind, or to deny\r\n    it.\"--_Civiltá_, VII. ii. 151.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning ascribed to the supposed penitent is the following--\r\n\r\n    You, as my confessor, have not the right to lay on me as you\r\n    would on a private man, the duty of devoting a certain day, and\r\n    of adopting certain means for the conversion of this or that\r\n    person. Doubtless, I ought, by word and example, to lay myself out\r\n    for the conversion and edification of my neighbour; but it rests\r\n    with me as a free agent to select the means and to discern the\r\n    opportunity. In like manner, you cannot order me as politician,\r\n    legislator, or prince, to take, this very day, this or that\r\n    measure, against blasphemy for example, or Sunday labour, or the\r\n    licence of the Press. Lay it upon me to attend to the propagation\r\n    of righteousness and truth; but leave it to me to judge of the\r\n    opportunity, and to choose the means. And, I pray you, consider\r\n    the grounds of my opinions. In the first place, whenever we speak\r\n    or act, we have on one side the truth and right, which certainly\r\n    ought to be respected; but on the other side we have fitness and\r\n    opportunity, of which also we must take account, if we would speak\r\n    to good purpose. Now, in this respect, I know better than any other\r\n    what I can do, and what I cannot, in my family, or in a political\r\n    assembly, or in the nation. In the next place, perhaps you do not\r\n    see the absurdity which would follow the opposite opinion. It\r\n    would follow that you had the right to decide and _regulate all\r\n    my actions_, because into every one of them _morality may enter_;\r\n    and every one of them may be connected with religion. You would be\r\n    able to dictate my will, to tell me what vote I ought to give, to\r\n    determine whether I am to declare peace or war. Mere trifles, you\r\n    say. But what, in that case, would temporal power be, but a passive\r\n    instrument of the spiritual power, and a mere machine? These are\r\n    the reasons why I stand to my old notions on this point, and have\r\n    no thought of changing them for others.\r\n\r\nIn this case, as thus put, and in the ensuing discussion, we see the\r\nconfessor of a king or minister preparing to meet his \"penitent.\" In\r\nthe language of Montalembert, we see the feeling of a politician in\r\nfacing the \"tribunal,\" under an Ultramontane confessor; and in the\r\npapers of the _Civiltá_ we see the glaring eye of Rome searching out\r\nevery movement of the one and the other.\r\n\r\nThe case being thus stated, both as to its substance and as to the\r\nreasoning of the supposed penitent, the discussion began. Abbé\r\nMichaud, of the Madeleine, maintained that the confessor ought to\r\ngrant absolution. Abbé G----, a Dominican, maintained that he ought\r\nnot to do so. Archbishop Darboy now and then interfered, to moderate\r\nthe opposition of the latter. The Abbé Falcimagne interrupted the\r\nArchbishop, declaring that he would deny the absolution, for the\r\nsupposed penitent was unworthy of it. Finally, the Abbé Hamon, Curé of\r\nSaint Sulpice, read out four conclusions, which were fully accepted\r\nby the Archbishop, and which allowed the confessor to grant the\r\nabsolution. The _Opinion Nationale_ and other journals said that this\r\nconclusion showed to how little the condemnations of the Syllabus\r\namounted.\r\n\r\nBoth the conclusion and the grounds on which it was rested gave huge\r\noffence at Rome. The _Civiltá_ was not content with less than five\r\nlong articles, making ninety octavo pages. It is in these that the\r\nthings are set forth which fired the embers of Montalembert's true\r\nlove of liberty, and damped his dying hope of ever seeing his ideal\r\nCatholicism and actual Popery seated on the same throne. We need not\r\nquote the passages which are echoed in his indignant repudiation; but\r\nwe give a few others, which show that, strongly as we have seen him put\r\nthe case, he was not guilty of any injustice. The Abbé Michaud said\r\nthat the liberty condemned was not moderate liberty, but unbounded\r\nliberty.[116] The _Civiltá_ took it for granted that he could not have\r\nbeen sincere.\r\n\r\n    \"Similar to liberty of worship, is that worst of liberties,\r\n    never sufficiently execrated or abhorred--liberty of the Press,\r\n    which some dare to invoke and promote with so much clamour.\" It\r\n    continues--\"In respect of religion and the Press, it is idle to\r\n    distinguish between two sorts of liberty, one wise and the other\r\n    unbridled, as the Abbé did. In such matters, all liberty is a\r\n    delirium and a pestilence. There is no healthy man's delirium;\r\n    all delirium is that of a sick man. There is no praiseworthy and\r\n    harmless plague; every plague is deadly.... Hence, it is never a\r\n    decent thing to introduce such liberty into a civil community. It\r\n    is only permissible to tolerate it in certain cases, in the same\r\n    way that a pest is tolerated\" (p. 160).\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Michaud had said that, in mixed questions, the State\r\ninterfered by _the same right as the Church_! Such an utterance\r\nsavoured of our bad times. It was infected with the idea of the\r\nindependence of the civil power in regard to the ecclesiastical. This\r\nidea was born with Protestantism; but it has been received by some\r\nCatholics, sincere, it is true, though not discerning.\r\n\r\n    It is true that the temporal prince is invested with supreme power\r\n    and authority, in his order; but from this it follows only that\r\n    he is not subject to any other earthly power. It does not follow\r\n    that his authority, sovereign in its order, cannot be subject and\r\n    is not subject to another authority of a more perfect order; that\r\n    is, the spiritual.... It is necessary that whoever holds power,\r\n    even sovereign, for temporal rule shall be regulated by the Roman\r\n    Pontiff (pp. 161-63).\r\n\r\nSo far for the independence of the State. Now as to its right of\r\nintervention in mixed questions, and above all, as to the defining of\r\nlimits between the two powers--\r\n\r\n    The State ought first to learn, from the Church, what are mixed\r\n    questions, that it may not take spiritual matters for mixed ones,\r\n    confounding both the one and the other with those which are called\r\n    temporal ones. Each separate kind of corn must be tied up into a\r\n    separate sheaf. The State ought to arrange with the Church every\r\n    time it puts a hand to what is temporal in these mixed matters, in\r\n    order that it may not violate what is spiritual.\r\n\r\nThe _Civiltá_ quotes M. Renan, where he shows how the Syllabus has\r\nproved his assertion of 1848. \"The Syllabus is a luminous demonstration\r\nof the proposition I maintained, that Catholicism and liberty are two\r\nthings incompatible.\" The _Civiltá_ adds that, in order to know this\r\nfact, M. Renan did not need to be a profound theologian, but only\r\nneeded to read the works of any author sincerely Catholic. It points\r\nout that the Liberal Catholics fancy that the Popes, in condemning\r\nliberty of worship and of the Press, only spoke of part of the subject,\r\nthat is, of some sorts of liberty; and that it was, therefore, some\r\nliberty, not all, that they called madness, poison, and pestilence. But\r\nthe Popes, asserts the _Civiltá_, on the contrary, thought that all\r\nliberty of worship and of the Press bore those characters (p. 314).\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Falcimagne insisted (p. 316) that the supposed penitent should\r\nbe at once treated as a sick man, and as being not of sound reason--\r\n\r\n    He comes to submit himself to my tribunal, and at the same time\r\n    rejects my authority. To see how far I can yield to his spiritual\r\n    infirmity I must see how far the authority of the confessor over\r\n    the penitent extends. On this point, I shall cite the words of\r\n    Domenico Soto, who, after hearing the confession of Charles\r\n    V, said, \"So far, you have confessed the sins of Charles; now\r\n    confess those of the Emperor.\" Soto at least thought that the\r\n    actions of his penitent, although they belonged to the political\r\n    order, nevertheless came within the cognizance of his tribunal.\r\n    Our patient is of a diametrically opposite opinion. He will not\r\n    recognize in me the right of judging him in what touches doctrine\r\n    and morals indirectly. But I hold that, as confessor, I have a\r\n    right to judge my penitent, be he a legislator, or even a prelate\r\n    of the Church, in things pertaining to dogmas and morals, and\r\n    to prohibit what is contrary to either, whether directly or\r\n    indirectly. So I can command him to cease from holding presumptuous\r\n    tenets.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop then asked the Abbé Falcimagne, requesting him to give\r\na direct answer, if he had a right to order his penitent to leave a\r\nhundred thousand francs in his will to be distributed among the poor.\r\nTo this the Abbé Falcimagne made no reply. He said the point now was\r\nto know whether the penitent, who would not renounce his modern ideas\r\nas to liberty, was or was not guilty of presumption, _temerarius_.\r\n\"Guilty of presumption,\" replied the Archbishop, \"is that confessor\r\nwho lays his hands on temporal things, assessing what he has no right\r\nto assess.\" \"But,\" retorted Falcimagne, \"I have the right to judge my\r\npenitent as to his disposition; and if he comes to me, and says that he\r\nwishes to maintain his principles, and declares that I have not a right\r\nto judge him, I tell him that his pretensions are illegitimate; that\r\nhis reason is disordered by modern principles; and that, if he will not\r\nrenounce those principles, I cannot absolve him.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Civiltá_ thinks that, at this point, they came to the heart of\r\nthe matter. On one side they began to allege that the confessor could\r\nnot require his penitent to renounce his opinions unless they were\r\nheretical, or were opinions condemned by the Church. A very false\r\ndoctrine! exclaims the oracle; for, in addition to heretical opinions,\r\na true Catholic must renounce many others--those, for instance, which\r\nare proximate to heresy; those which are presumptuous, scandalous,\r\nand all indeed that are offensive to pious ears. The teaching power\r\nof our Church is not merely infallible, and not only does it define\r\nwith infallibility when defining articles of faith, but also when\r\ndefining any truth, scientific or practical, political or historical,\r\nwhich is connected, in any manner whatever, with dogma and morals; and\r\nwhoever would be a sincere Catholic must conform not only in respectful\r\nsilence, but with interior assent of the intellect (p. 318).\r\n\r\nThe _Civiltá_ proceeds to quote the opinions of the \"good journals\"\r\nof Italy, laying stress on the point that the opinions held by the\r\nsupposed penitent could not be probable opinions--being in fact those\r\nwhich were already condemned in the Syllabus. It proceeds with great\r\nvigour to maintain that the Syllabus was the decree, not only of the\r\nPope, but also of the five hundred bishops who had adhered to it\r\nlast year (1867). Of these, the _Civiltá_ correctly says that Darboy\r\nhimself was one. It next contributes an important item of information,\r\nwhich completes the evidence of the perfect and formal ecclesiastical\r\nauthority of all the condemnations of the Syllabus, on either theory\r\nof the constitution of the Church, the Papal or the Episcopal. After\r\nthe address of the five hundred bishops present in Rome, all the absent\r\nones, asserts the _Civiltá_, sent in their adhesion by letter, which\r\nthey hastened to forward to this Roman chair, where, with the living\r\nPontiff, resides the \"spirit of truth\" (p. 324). Hence it draws the\r\ninference, which is a just conclusion, if we may say so, in the face\r\nof a hundred English writers who, following an old tradition, when\r\nreviewing what Dr. Newman put upon paper on this subject, called it\r\nlogical.\r\n\r\n    \"This penitent (says the great organ of the Vatican), openly\r\n    opposes the teaching power of the Church, whether that teaching\r\n    power is considered as being exercised by the Bishop of Rome alone,\r\n    or as being exercised by him in conjunction with all the bishops of\r\n    Christendom. That teaching power has pronounced in the one mode and\r\n    in the other, and has proscribed those opinions. In both ways has\r\n    it condemned opinions, not imaginary or belonging to bygone times,\r\n    but opinions which to-day, and under our eye, are pertinaciously\r\n    maintained and reduced to practice\" (p. 324).\r\n\r\nReturning with intense earnestness to this point, it says (p. 543)--\r\n\r\n    The universal Bishop has spoken alone, and further, he has spoken\r\n    conjointly with the bishops of the particular Churches. To\r\n    contradict after this, is in effect to separate oneself from the\r\n    whole of the pastors, and from him who is supreme among them all.\r\n\r\nThis is not enough. Some pages later, hesitation, on this question so\r\nvital to practical government, is again censured, in replying to the\r\nplea that the supposed penitent might be worthy of absolution on the\r\nground of invincible ignorance--\r\n\r\n    We shall never tell him that ignorance consists in this, namely,\r\n    that after he has read the Encyclical and the Syllabus, and re-read\r\n    them, he could not understand that the modern opinions, which\r\n    he retained, have been truly condemned, or that they have been\r\n    condemned rightfully. This is not ignorance. It is an error and a\r\n    pertinacity proper to a man not far removed from heresy. In this\r\n    case, we once more repeat, confession is not the thing wanted. The\r\n    first elements of the faith, and of the Catholic profession, have\r\n    to be set straight in this man's head (p. 547).\r\n\r\nIt would almost seem as if Montalembert was personally pointed at in\r\nthe two later articles. It is not a little curious to learn here that\r\nhis bosom friend, Lacordaire, long the charm of the French pulpit, was\r\ncalled to Rome in 1850 to answer for his doctrine. The points on which\r\nhe had to set himself right with Rome were anything but, in our sense,\r\nreligious ones: (1) The coercive power of the Church; (2) The origin\r\nof sovereignty; and (3) The temporal power of the Pope. He did set\r\nhimself right. Father Jandel, the General of the Dominicans, exulting\r\nover his answer on the question touching the coercive power, says,\r\n\"It avenges his memory from the suspicion of complicity with certain\r\nopinions which some Catholics would fain shelter under the authority of\r\nhis name.\"[117] Avenges his memory! It proves that whatever Lacordaire\r\nbelieved, he submitted to write as his own the doctrine of Rome,\r\nthat the Church has power to \"employ external force,\" and to inflict\r\nbodily pains. And so France sees the memory of her Bossuet held up\r\nto reproach, and the memory of her Lacordaire yoked by the Dominican\r\nGeneral to his beloved Inquisition. She sees her Montalembert driven\r\nfrom public life, assailed, yea, reviled, while living, preparatory to\r\nbeing insulted when dead.\r\n\r\nAny one acquainted with the high spirit and immense emotional force of\r\nMontalembert, can imagine his reddening and shivering at finding the\r\nfollowing among the citations from Renan to prove that the sceptic\r\nunderstood the doctrine of \"Catholicism\" better than its professed\r\nfriends in France--\r\n\r\n    The remedy applied by the Church of Rome to the liberty of worship\r\n    and liberty of thought is the Inquisition. The Councils have\r\n    established and approved the Inquisition, the Fathers and bishops\r\n    have counselled and practised it. The Inquisition is the logical\r\n    outgrowth of the whole orthodox system, and the quintessence of the\r\n    spirit of the Church.[118]\r\n\r\nStrongly as our sympathies are with Montalembert and Darboy, we feel\r\nthat, so long as the Jesuits have to prove that persecution is the\r\ndoctrine and has been the practice of the Church, they have it all\r\ntheir own way against the Liberal Catholics, till they creep up to the\r\nearly ages.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: _L'Espagne et la Liberté._ Bibliothèque Universelle de\r\nLausanne, 1876, p. 626.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: Ibid. p. 635.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: _Civiltá Cattolica_, VII, ii. p. 150 ff.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: Serie VII. vol. iii. p. 65.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: Serie VII. vol. iii. p. 56.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nWhat is to be the Work of the Council--Fears caused by Grandiose\r\nProjects--_Reform of the Church in Head and Members_--Statesmen evince\r\nConcern.\r\n\r\n\r\nCuriosity as to what the particular work of the Council was to be\r\ngrew all the more rapidly, because no authoritative indication of\r\nit was given. Were the Jesuit tenets of Papal authority and Papal\r\ninfallibility to be raised into dogmas? Was the Pope to make another\r\noffering to the Virgin by proclaiming as an article of faith, that her\r\nbody had been carried to heaven? By the repetition of such questions,\r\ntens of millions partially awoke to the consciousness that they\r\nbelonged to a religion which knew not what might be its standard of\r\nfaith next year, much less did it know to what particular tenets it\r\nmight be committed.\r\n\r\nThen, as to the position of the bishops, were they to be only\r\ncouncillors, or also judges? If the latter, they would first hear the\r\ndoctors, as did their predecessors at Trent; would next deliberate,\r\nand finally would formulate decrees, which decrees without alteration,\r\nwould be confirmed by the Pontiff. But if the bishops were no longer\r\njudges of the faith, but simply councillors of the one judge, their\r\nplace would be to argue points, as the doctors had done at Trent, while\r\nthe decree should be that of the Pope, and they would merely assent.\r\n\r\nAgain, as to the composition of the Council, were the bishops _in\r\npartibus_ to be members? Was Darboy, whose diocese counted two millions\r\nof souls, to be balanced by some Court creature with a title from\r\nSardis or Ecbatana? or was Schwarzenberg, with Bohemia at his back,\r\nto be balanced by an instrument of the Curia, who, independently of\r\nhis patrons, had not a month's bread to call his own? Were those who\r\nrepresented ancient and numerous churches, and who were as far free\r\nagents as men under Rome can be, to be voted against, man for man,\r\nby vicars apostolic, without churches, or with only new and ignorant\r\nones--men depending on the Propaganda even for their travelling\r\nexpenses and board?\r\n\r\nFinally, as to the mode of procedure, were the bishops, as they did at\r\nTrent, to agree upon their own rules of procedure, to evolve by mutual\r\nconsultation the questions demanding solution, and to discuss them till\r\nall were ready to vote? Or could there be truth in the suspicion that\r\neverything was being cut and dried beforehand, and that the Court would\r\nimpose ready-made rules of procedure, and allow no one but itself to\r\nintroduce any subject for discussion?\r\n\r\nAs to the burning question of moral unanimity, would projected formulae\r\nbe passed from hand to hand, as was done at Trent, examined in meetings\r\nof groups, retouched, and, if need be, remoulded till a form was\r\narrived at in which all but two or three acquiesced? Or was it possible\r\nthat formulae for new articles in a creed prepared behind the backs of\r\nthe bishops would be imposed on millions and for ever, by a majority\r\nmade up with the help of the bishops _in partibus_?\r\n\r\nAll this time, the nine determined men forming the secret Directing\r\nCongregation, were coolly looking at the same questions, and, step\r\nby step, as we shall see, when events bring out the secret plans,\r\nwere settling those questions in the sense most dreaded, and going\r\nto lengths not, we believe, suggested in any of the anticipatory\r\nexpressions of fear.\r\n\r\nEarnest theologians who had not been converted by the infallibilist\r\npropaganda of recent years, were thrown into consternation. Some\r\nbishops, able administrators, saw no essential difference between Papal\r\ninfallibility as a doctrine taught in many of the schools, and believed\r\nby great numbers if rejected by others perhaps greater, and the same\r\nopinion as an article of faith. In such a view, the men of thought saw\r\nthe superficial glance of \"practical men,\" as they call themselves, who\r\nnever discover anything but by feeling it, and who live by acting out\r\nto-day what others thought out in time gone by.\r\n\r\nLittle difference! thought the men of foresight. We are going to\r\nbe compelled to alter our catechisms and creed in the face of the\r\nProtestants; going to be compelled to teach the opposite of what we\r\nhave always taught; going to part with immemorial safeguards against\r\naltering the conditions of salvation, or further narrowing the terms\r\nof membership in the Church--to part with the necessity before every\r\nsuch change of the open and formal process of a General Council! The\r\nproposed dogma is unlike any now in the creed, in the all-important\r\npoint of being self-multiplying. If it is adopted, we shall be liable\r\nto have eternal obligations laid upon our souls, without a week's\r\nwarning.\r\n\r\nBeside fears like these, others perhaps more general were those of\r\nquiet Catholics wishing to live in peace and serve their respective\r\nnations loyally, who being conscious that even now they were liable to\r\nsuspicion of a divided allegiance, feared that if the Jesuit tenets\r\nbecame the creed, their political relations would be less comfortable,\r\nand their prospects of office not so good. \"At the Vatican,\" says _Ce\r\nqui se Passe au Concile_, speaking of the mystery and the uneasiness\r\nof this moment; \"At the Vatican they spoke in low tones of grandiose\r\nprojects that were to transform the world, and by exalting Pius IX were\r\nto confound the enemies of the Church.\" It was those grandiose projects\r\nwhich made good citizens fear for their own future political standing.\r\n\r\nEven feelings of this sort, as represented by _Holtgreven_, ought to\r\ntouch us, being those of silent millions awaiting in the dark the\r\nsentence of their lords in Council. He says--\r\n\r\n    When we left the gymnasium, soon after the year 1860, there was no\r\n    pupil who could say that, even by hint, he had been taught there\r\n    that the Pope was infallible by himself, and without the consent\r\n    of the Church. The answer 128 in Martin's _Handbook of Religion_\r\n    is still too fresh in the memory of all; an answer which affirms\r\n    that the grace of infallibility belongs only to the collective body\r\n    of bishops, as successors of the Apostles.... Persons in office\r\n    and out of it, clergy, laity, and exalted Church dignitaries,\r\n    agreed that the pretensions of the Pope to power over kings and\r\n    nations, in matters of allegiance and such like, were not part of\r\n    their religion, but arose out of the state of the civil laws in\r\n    the middle ages.... Thus does the Catholic teacher teach in his\r\n    lectures on Church history, thus does the student learn; and this\r\n    view, which captivates the youth, putting his German heart at rest,\r\n    and rejoicing it, still gives him repose and removes every scruple\r\n    when, as a man, he lifts up the hand to swear allegiance to the\r\n    laws of the fatherland.[119]\r\n\r\nThose of the French clergy whose education had been carried beyond the\r\nusual round of Latin, logic, and manners, began to manifest misgivings\r\nas to the effect of the impending change on men of enlarged culture. It\r\nwas in March, 1869, that the _Unitá_ published the Pope's famous letter\r\nto the Archbishop of Paris, described in a former chapter. The Paris\r\ncorrespondent of that journal, commenting upon it, calls the dignitary\r\nwho, in the eye of the world, would be his metropolitan and ordinary,\r\n\"a pretty fellow\"--_bel soggetto_--whom no one would any longer look\r\nupon as a candidate for the rank of Cardinal. In the same letter he\r\nsays that war against Prussia must break out, whether the occasion be\r\nthe Belgian railways, or complaints that Prussia violates the treaty of\r\nPrague.\r\n\r\nFears as to coming changes, in their effect on men of culture, were\r\nfelt still more deeply in Germany, where the general education of\r\nthe clergy was higher than elsewhere. Both the German clergy and the\r\nnobler of the French were unprepared for what they began, in secret,\r\nto call Pius-cult, as it appeared in the language employed by the\r\nfavoured organs. One word in the prayer for the Pope, recommended by\r\nthe _Unitá_, on March 12, grated not on Protestant ears only. The _Ave\r\nMaria_ was for a week to be followed by these petitions: \"Eternal\r\nFather, defend Pius IX! Eternal Word, assist Pius IX! Holy Spirit,\r\nglorify Pius IX!\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps none of the publications now flowing from the Press excited\r\ngreater attention than one which was announced as being from the pen\r\nof one of the best known of the Austrian clergy. It was entitled\r\n_The Reform of the Romish Church in Head and Members_. Not only does\r\nthis author oppose the attempt to restore laws enforcing unity of\r\ncreed, but he actually does so on principle, as well as on the ground\r\nof expediency. The longing of Rome for the subjection of the States\r\nof the world, and for power again to employ the arm of the State in\r\nher service, is, he contends, a delusion which will lead only to her\r\noverthrow. Moreover, he lays down the startling principle that the\r\nChurch has nothing to ask but liberty to act in her own sphere _like\r\nany private society_. This last position is utterly irreconcilable with\r\nall the ordinary theories. He holds that anything granted to the Church\r\nby the State beyond what is given to any other private society is an\r\nevil, and also that every case, in the past, wherein Church and State\r\nhave joined hands in order to help one another to gain their respective\r\nends, has turned out ill for both of them. In modern times his ideal of\r\nthe normal relation of Church and State is that existing in America,\r\nwhich he imagines works favourably for Romanism.\r\n\r\nThe author of _Reform in Head and Members_ looks on the system of\r\nlower seminaries for boys and higher ones for young men, in which the\r\nfuture clergy pass their youth separated from all society, leading an\r\nunreal life, pursuing narrow studies and without knowledge of men, or\r\nthe possibility of acquiring any breadth of mind, as producing only\r\na race of priests unfit to lead an educated age. He declares that in\r\nFrance, Italy, and Spain the system of close seminaries has destroyed\r\ntheological science among Catholics. He manifests the ordinary\r\ncontempt of German scholars for the showy and wordy pupils of the\r\nRoman seminaries, and contends that Catholic theology does not bear\r\nany comparison, as to talent and learning, with Protestant theology\r\nin any country except Germany, where the priests have to study at the\r\nuniversities. He further believes that the lamentable moral condition\r\nof the Romish clergy is not a little to be ascribed to the seclusion\r\nand unreality in which their youth is passed (p. 161).\r\n\r\n    The young priests in whose hands the guidance of the people is\r\n    to be placed, squander the fair and precious years of youth in\r\n    enclosures shut off from the world, and out of them do they go\r\n    forth into life without experience of men or of the world. Then\r\n    does the world, with all its charms, allurements, delights,\r\n    and seductions, rush in upon those narrow, inexperienced young\r\n    clergymen; and alas! only too many of them sink in a sea which to\r\n    them is new, strange, and untried.\r\n\r\nHe demands a thorough reform of this system, insisting that the\r\ncontempt shown by all respectable Italians for the priesthood is not to\r\nbe accounted for except on the ground of this wretched system and of\r\nits wretched moral and religious results.\r\n\r\nAnother demand boldly made by this Austrian priest is for the\r\nabolition of the vows of celibacy, so far as they are either perpetual\r\nor obligatory. He would admit of vows that were both voluntary and\r\ntemporary. The corrupting effects of celibacy evidently leave him no\r\nhope that it is capable of being rendered consistent with tolerable\r\nmorality. He treats this institution as purely local and Romish,\r\nregarding its imposition upon the Catholic Church as a great public\r\nevil, impossible to be justified. At page 117 he says, \"Upon the law\r\nof the Romish Church fall back all those moral abominations, beyond\r\nmeasure and beyond number, which have arisen out of it, and which will\r\nstain the Church as long as that law remains in force.\" When the writer\r\napproaches the subject of bureaucratic centralization, the Catholic\r\nrises against the Romanism which has fastened itself on the Churches\r\nof other nations. This system of centralization as carried out by the\r\nCuria is much too narrow legitimately to claim the name of national.\r\nOur author wants to see an end of the system. He wonders what may be\r\nthe annual revenue paid into Rome from all quarters of the globe for\r\nindults, dispensations, indulgencies, remissions of sins, and the fees\r\ngained by all the inventions for what he calls selling poor parchment\r\nand bad writing very dear. He does not, like many writers when they\r\ntouch this subject, break out into a passion against the huckstering of\r\ntheir religion, but manifests a cold contempt, feeling that the system\r\nis low and hollow.\r\n\r\nThe modern contrivance for making a bishop a tenant on a short lease is\r\ncalmly exposed. Formerly, as the author points out, a bishop used to\r\nrule his own diocese; now he is no more than a delegate. He is allowed\r\nto distribute such dispensations for the smaller sins against Church\r\nlaw as do not pay any money tax, but his power to do this, as also his\r\npower to perform several other of the acts essential to his office,\r\nis no longer conveyed to him with the office itself. On the contrary,\r\nfor that power he is dependent upon a lease, never given for more than\r\nfive years, called the QUINQUENNIAL FACULTIES. If at the expiration of\r\none of these terms the Faculties are not renewed, he becomes a mere\r\nlay figure in his chair, and would be at once exposed to his clergy\r\nand people as under disgrace. By this means is he kept a perpetual\r\npensioner on the favour of the Curia, and in addition to the periodical\r\nexpiration of the ordinary lease, he is a tenant at will, liable any\r\nday to have his Faculties withdrawn by the Holy Father.\r\n\r\n    The centralizing of the government of the Church in the See of\r\n    Rome, to effect which it was necessary to destroy the rights of\r\n    metropolitans and to curtail the jurisdiction of bishops, is a\r\n    state of things so unjustifiable and ruinous, that the well-being\r\n    of the Church urgently demands its removal. This absorption of all\r\n    the powers and rights of Church government is not to be justified\r\n    either by pleading the necessity of preserving the unity of the\r\n    Church, or by pleading the supreme hierarchical power, which\r\n    belongs to the See of Rome. The very necessity of manifesting\r\n    unity presupposes a number of persons entrusted with independent\r\n    functions of government; and if the incumbent of the highest\r\n    power of the Church strips the subordinate functionaries of all\r\n    authority, he makes himself the sole seat of power in the Church.\r\n\r\nThis writer would restore worship in the mother tongue.\r\n\r\nStatesmen began to feel concern, at least such as did not belong to the\r\nclass finely laughed at by M. Veuillot, who do not think it necessary\r\nto inform themselves on \"the small affairs of the Catholic Church,\"\r\nalthough speaking, legislating, and perhaps writing on matters of which\r\nthose affairs form a considerable element.\r\n\r\nNaturally such fears were sooner and more seriously felt by Roman\r\nCatholic statesmen than by Protestant ones. Though _Von Lutz_,\r\nMinister of Worship in Bavaria, spoke after the event, he tersely\r\nexpressed the apprehensions felt at this time--\r\n\r\n    \"The Church lays down the principle that the Pope is Prince of\r\n    princes, and Lord Paramount (_Oberherr_) of all States. Do you\r\n    think it possible that States will put up with that? That the State\r\n    will quietly stand by while the bishop orders the parish priest to\r\n    preach against the law of the land, and while he deposes him if he\r\n    will not comply? Or must the State itself drive the parish priest\r\n    out of his home for refusing to misuse the pulpit, against the\r\n    State?\"[120]\r\n\r\nBishop Fessler, of St. Pölten,[121] in a lengthy manifesto, gave a\r\nclear intimation that the infallibility of the Pope would probably be\r\ndefined by the Council. This set many Catholics in Germany on preparing\r\nto combat the intention announced, and set still more on saying that\r\nas Fessler had been the first to face the German public with this\r\nintimation, his fortune was made at Rome.\r\n\r\nBishop Dupanloup, of Orleans, put forth his best literary power in\r\nwhat was called, by the _Constitutionnel_, an attempt to bring about a\r\nreconciliation between the Council and the principles of 1789.[122] He\r\nurged that they greatly erred who looked upon the approaching Council\r\nas a menace against modern society, or as a declaration of war with\r\nprogress. On the contrary, freedom, fraternity and progress, so far\r\nas they were true and good, had nothing to fear from this \"senate of\r\nhumanity.\"\r\n\r\nBishop Von Ketteler, of Mainz, declared that the forthcoming Council\r\nwas the greatest event of our age[123]--\r\n\r\n    At least (added this doughty pupil of the Jesuits), in the work of\r\n    reconstruction; for as to destruction, certainly, there have been\r\n    greater events. As God provided for the Church and the world in\r\n    the century of the so-called Reformation, by means of the Council\r\n    of Trent, so has He in our century, which, still sadder to say, is\r\n    the century of Revolution, the century of demolition and universal\r\n    destruction, inspired the High Pontiff with the supreme remedy, the\r\n    convocation of the Vatican Council. The work of destruction is\r\n    manifestly hasting to its end. It is time to commence the work of\r\n    reconstruction, on the ancient foundation laid by Christ once for\r\n    all. This is precisely the work to which the Council is called.\r\n\r\nThese words we quote from the _Civiltá_, to which the whole document\r\nseemed highly laudable.[124] But its translation is strong. Ketteler\r\ndid not use the term \"reconstruction\" for his German audience, but\r\n\"construction.\" He did not say that God had inspired the Pontiff, but\r\nthat the Spirit of God again assembled the General Council, the highest\r\nCourt of Judgment for the Truth on earth. This last form of words had\r\nthe merit of which our English tongue has within the last few years\r\npresented some examples of all but incredible skill--the merit of\r\nsuggesting to a Protestant an idea that would not awaken his political\r\nfears, and yet of representing to the Jesuits of the _Civiltá_ the\r\ntrue doctrine. The Pope himself began to take part in the controversy\r\nnow gradually rising. The Abbé Belet had translated into French the\r\nwork of the Jesuit Father Weninger, published in New York. The Pope\r\nwrote a brief to thank him, taking occasion at the same time harshly\r\nto censure the great Bossuet, as a bishop who, in order to flatter the\r\ncivil power, contradicted his own proper opinions, and contradicted the\r\noriginal doctrine of the Church.[125]\r\n\r\nPleasant to the military palate of Pius IX were the words of brave\r\nColonel Allet, in a soldierly order of the day, issued in December, to\r\nhis zouaves. After recounting in terse, strong terms, their services\r\nagainst the Garibaldians, he says--\r\n\r\n    Soldiers! all is not over. Great dangers still threaten the Church.\r\n    Remember that in your regiment you stand, not merely as soldiers\r\n    marching side by side; you also represent a principle before the\r\n    world, the principle of the voluntary and disinterested defence\r\n    of the Holy See. You are the nucleus around which will unite in\r\n    the hour of danger the prayers, the succours, and the hopes of the\r\n    Catholic world. Be, then, true soldiers of God. You have not merely\r\n    duties, you have even a mission, and you will not fulfil it without\r\n    union, discipline, moral conduct, and military instruction. A third\r\n    battalion is formed. Your swelling ranks assure to you a larger\r\n    part in future struggles. We shall march together to the cry of\r\n    \"Long Live Pius IX!\"\r\n\r\nFunereal solemnities on behalf of the fallen are proudly recorded as\r\nhaving been celebrated in France, England, Germany, etc.\r\n\r\nTo these military consolations were added such as a crown and a nation\r\nonce great could now bestow. Queen Isabella strongly recommended from\r\nthe throne, and her Cortes almost unanimously voted, that the forces of\r\nthe nation, acting in alliance with the Emperor of the French, should\r\nbe ready to defend the Holy See.[126] What was more important, the King\r\nof Prussia, in reply to Ledochowsky, spoke clearly in support of the\r\ntemporal power. It was also told with satisfaction how, at banquets,\r\nboth at Malines and Namur, the health of the Pope was drunk before that\r\nof the King of Belgium, and how pleasantly the Nuncio gave the health\r\nof the local and subordinate sovereign after that of his master, as the\r\nLord Paramount, had received its meed.[127]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy for us, whose faith has always rested on the fixed\r\nstandard of God's Word, to enter into all the feelings of suspense\r\nwhich are to be read between the lines of a lecture by Professor\r\nMenzel, then of Braunsberg, now of Bonn, printed for private\r\ncirculation among his former pupils.[128] He is teaching them the\r\ndoctrine of _Church_ infallibility, but not, as he had hitherto\r\ndone, in the twofold confidence of persuasion and personal security.\r\nPersuasion abides, reinforced by fresh study and animated by assault.\r\nBut security is gone. The consciousness that he may never more be\r\nallowed to teach this doctrine weighs upon all he utters. Before\r\nanother session, should his own faith not change, that of his chair\r\nprobably will. The Church which he had served, as permitting the\r\nmembership of those who denied the infallibility of the Pope, had been\r\ncatholic enough for him. But now, after pausing since the Reformation,\r\nshe had actively resumed the process of narrowing the terms of\r\nmembership by dogmatizing new shibboleths. One had been already added\r\nin his own day. Another now hung overhead, still more momentous,\r\nbecause it not only altered the doctrine of the Church, but altered the\r\nstandard of doctrine, and was moreover self-propagating--a seed bearing\r\nfruit after its kind.\r\n\r\n\"This complete subversion of the old Catholic principle, _everywhere,\r\nalways, and by all_,\" cries the poor Professor, \"has found its most\r\ndoughty champions in the Jesuits of the _Civiltá Cattolica_, with\r\ntheir branch at _Maria Laach_, and in the Archbishops of Malines and\r\nWestminster, Deschamps and Manning.\"[129] In the struggling argument of\r\nthe Teacher of this year, we cannot help hearing, by anticipation, the\r\nsighs of the excommunicated of next year; excommunicated for holding\r\nfast what he had always taught, with the sanction of the Church, and\r\nfrom one of her chairs! And as the iron enters into his soul, he\r\nevidently feels it hard that an English hand should be one of the\r\nforemost in driving it home.\r\n\r\nProfessors looked from the chair on their classes not knowing what\r\nthey might have to teach a twelvemonth hence. Preachers looked from\r\nthe pulpit on their congregations weighted with the same uncertainty.\r\nEditors wrote that the Catholic faith was thus and thus, feeling\r\nthat, perhaps, soon they must write the reverse, or else drop the\r\npen. Heads of families were perplexed as to what they should say to\r\ntheir children, if compelled to believe what they and their fathers\r\nhad always resented as a false accusation against their religion.\r\nJurists wondered if they must either break with their clergy or\r\nbegin a campaign for reinstating canon law over civil. Kings whose\r\nforefathers had compelled nations, by the sword, to wear the yoke of\r\nRome, chafed to think that their religion was to be \"changed over\r\ntheir heads.\" But all this time the silent arbiters of the Catholic's\r\ndestiny were patiently framing the decrees. Men moved and combined\r\nto prevent new fetters from being forged for their souls next year;\r\nbut link was being already noiselessly added to link, by old,\r\ncool, and resolute masters. The Emperor set to defend the Gallican\r\nliberties for the millions of France, and the Emperor set to uphold\r\nthe Josephine safeguards for the millions of Austria, had no access to\r\nthe subterranean forge _Antra Ætnaca_ where chains and thunderbolts\r\nwere on the anvil, away from the ears of men. Turnus had not less\r\npower over the island cave where the arms by which he was to fall were\r\nbeing tempered. But, on the other hand, the Vulcan of the Syllabus\r\nhad more than one Venus at the Court of each potentate, wooing in his\r\ninterests, and pleading for his will. The truth, however, was to dawn\r\nupon their subjects from behind gorgeous clouds of their beloved pomps\r\nand ceremonies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: _Holtgreven_, pp. 4, 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: Menzel, _Jesuitenumtriebe_, p. 119.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: _Das Letzte und das Nächste Concil_, p. 59.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: _Lettre sur le futur Concile OEcuménique._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: _Das Allgemeine Concil und seine Bedeutung für unsere\r\nZeit._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: Serie VII. vol. vi. p. 93.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: _Friedberg_, p. 487.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: _Civiltá_, VII. i. pp. 228-30.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: Id. 622.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: _Ueber das Subject der kirchlichen Unfehlbarheit._ (_Als\r\nManuscript gedruckt._) Braunsberg: 1870.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: P. 7.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nAgitation in Bavaria and Germany--The Golden Rose--Fall of\r\nIsabella--The King of Bavaria obtains the Opinion of the\r\nFaculties--Döllinger--Schwarzenberg's Remonstrance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proximity of Bavaria to Italy on the one hand, and to Protestant\r\nGermany and Switzerland on the other, had assisted in giving to the\r\nschools of Munich a juster appreciation of the effect to be expected\r\nin the world at large, from new additions to the dogmatic burden\r\nwhich Catholics must carry. For a considerable time a conflict had\r\nbeen silently growing up between the theology of the German schools\r\nand that in recent years imported direct from Rome by the new type\r\nof priests there trained. The catechisms--even those prepared by the\r\nearly Jesuits--had been gradually altered, till first the denial of\r\nPapal infallibility disappeared, and secondly the statement of Church\r\ninfallibility was so obscured as to prepare the way for further change.\r\n\r\nJesuit establishments had been springing up in defiance of the law. The\r\nUltramontane Press had raged against the unity of Germany under the\r\nleadership of Prussia, writing so as to lead foreigners to believe that\r\nFrance had only to invade Germany and she would find the Catholics on\r\nher side. A _littérateur_ named Fischer being arrested at Landeck in\r\nJune, 1868, a letter was found from Count Platen, saying, \"A league of\r\nthe small states with France, for the common end of breaking the power\r\nof Prussia, is the duty of all.\"[130]\r\n\r\nThe feelings of the educated classes generally resented such attempts\r\nwith indignation. We have seen how Sepp spoke of the canonization\r\nof Arbues. The painter Kaulbach executed a picture of an _auto da\r\nfe_ celebrated under the eye of this new celestial patron. A priest\r\npreached against the sale of the engravings; and Kaulbach wrote a\r\nletter, which was printed in the _Cologne Gazette_, hailing such\r\nreproach as an honour, and appending a sketch of the Roman twins\r\ndrinking in the milk of the she-wolf. Of his Romulus and Remus, one\r\nwore the crown of imperial France, and the other the tiara.[131]\r\n\r\nGerman writers assert that Napoleon III induced Queen Isabella of\r\nSpain, in the spring of 1868, to pledge herself to send into Italy\r\nforty thousand men to protect the Pope, in case he should be obliged\r\nto withdraw his troops by entering on a war with Prussia. Other\r\nauthorities say that it was to be in case of a war with Italy. At\r\nall events, the most select favour the Pontiff had to confer on the\r\nworthiest lady of his Church, the golden rose, was sent to her most\r\nCatholic Majesty. This distinction placed Isabella on a level with the\r\nQueen of Naples and the Empress Eugènie, the only two lambs in all\r\nhis fold hitherto held worthy by Pius IX of this pontifical seal of\r\nstainless whiteness. But to the daughter of Queen Christina the golden\r\nrose proved to be the last rose of her summer. In September 1868 this\r\nelect lady, after outliving more insurrections than any sovereign\r\nin Christendom, was compelled to flee. An expression fell from the\r\n_Catholique_ of Brussels on the news that the crown of Isabella was\r\nthreatened, which throws light on the Ultramontane dialect: \"Spain\r\nwill be lost to Catholicism, lost to the cause of order in Europe,\r\nand _the last Christian government_ will have disappeared from the\r\nOld World.\"[132] This drew from Montalembert the remark: \"To wish\r\nmodern society, or any Christian born in that society and destined to\r\nlive in it, to esteem the condition of Spain under Isabella II more\r\nhighly than that of England under Victoria, and to wish this in the\r\nname of the Catholic Church, in the name of the party of order in\r\nEurope, is to impute to that party and to that Church the saddest of\r\nresponsibilities, and the most menacing.\"[133]\r\n\r\nBut all Catholic political personages were not as good Papists as Queen\r\nIsabella.\r\n\r\nMontalembert, full of thoughts suggested by the questions rising in\r\nthe Church, saw in her fall but an incident of the decay of Spain,\r\nwhich, again, was but the most striking example of the condition of\r\nmost Roman Catholic countries. He wrote what, as we have seen, appeared\r\nonly after his death. Confessing that the reign of Isabella had lasted\r\n\"too long,\" he traced the ruin of the country to \"despotism, spiritual\r\nand temporal, absolute monarchy, and the Inquisition.\" After showing\r\nthat both municipal and parliamentary liberties had been well developed\r\nin Spain in the days when she struggled, rose, and took the lead,\r\nhe dates the beginning of her fall from the combination of Church\r\nand State, under Charles V, to work unitedly in quenching civil and\r\nreligious liberty. Though no advocate of the separation of Church and\r\nState, he says, \"A thousand times better the fullest separation with\r\nall its excesses, than the absorption of the State by the Church, or of\r\nthe Church by the State.\" No better expression could have been chosen\r\nthan the former of these phrases to designate the effect of the Jesuit\r\npolity of Church and State just about to be adopted by Rome.\r\n\r\nHe takes the social and political effects of the Inquisition to have\r\nbeen disastrous--\"That monstrous institution ceased to act only when\r\nit had no more to do, when it had substituted emptiness, death, and\r\nnothingness for the life, the force, and the glory of the first nation\r\nof the middle ages, the one which we may justly call the pearl of the\r\nCatholic world.\" Aiming a two-edged thrust at Bonapartist legislatures,\r\nand at the character of the coming Council, he says that the\r\n\"ill-omened\" Charles V was the inventor \"of consultative despotism,\" or\r\nrepresentative absolutism, of which the Napoleons are wrongly accused\r\nof being the originators. For one who had spent his life in battling\r\nfor the Papacy, but always with the hope of reconciling it to liberty,\r\nit was bitter, when death was in view, to write: \"There is not in the\r\nhistory of the world a second example of a great country so ruined,\r\nso broken down, so fallen, without foreign conquest or civil war\r\nhaving materially contributed to the result, but by the sole effect of\r\ninstitutions of which it was the prey.\"[134]\r\n\r\nHad the Prime Minister of Bavaria at the juncture in question been a\r\nProtestant, he would have been slower in seeing the political bearings\r\nof what was taking place. One of the three brothers of Prince Hohenlohe\r\nwas a cardinal, and otherwise his means of information had been good.\r\nBesides, though Bavaria had often served the Papal cause to the hurt of\r\nGermany, it had never, like Prussia, given up its _placet_ and other\r\nguards of the royal supremacy. The Prime Minister submitted questions\r\nfor the formal opinion of the two Faculties of Theology and Law, in the\r\nUniversity of Munich, as to the effect which the definition of Papal\r\ninfallibility as a dogma would have upon the relations of the civil and\r\necclesiastical authorities.\r\n\r\nThe Faculty of Theology, in its reply, after referring to the work of\r\nSchrader, and quoting some of his propositions, says--\r\n\r\n    Should these or similar conclusions be adopted (i.e. the conclusion\r\n    of the Syllabus against freedom of religion, of the Press, etc.),\r\n    it would lead to great confusion. The counter principles are so\r\n    established, both in the theory and practice of all European\r\n    constitutions, that anything contrary to religious equality and\r\n    freedom of opinion can scarcely again obtain a footing. Were\r\n    it laid upon Catholics, as a duty of conscience, to repudiate\r\n    those principles, undeniably collision between their civil\r\n    and ecclesiastical obligations would result, and in certain\r\n    circumstances consequences would ensue, burdensome and hurtful\r\n    both to the individual members of a national Church and to the\r\n    collective body.[135]\r\n\r\nThe statesmen had asked the divines what was meant by speaking _ex\r\ncathedrâ_. The Faculty replied that among those who asserted the\r\ndoctrine of Papal infallibility, there were some twenty theories on\r\nthe subject, none of them authoritative or generally received, and\r\nall arbitrary; \"because here it is impossible to frame a theory from\r\nScripture and tradition.\"[136]\r\n\r\nThe Faculty of Law said--\r\n\r\n    Should the propositions of the Syllabus and the Papal infallibility\r\n    be made dogmas, the relations between State and Church hitherto\r\n    subsisting would be altered in their very principles, and nearly\r\n    all the legislation fixing the legal position of the Catholic\r\n    Church in Bavaria would be called in question.[137]\r\n\r\nThe chief of the Theological Faculty was Dr. Döllinger, whose aged but\r\nerect head was to every scholar in the University a crown of glory. The\r\nprofessors were proud of him, and of their attainments made under his\r\neye. In common with the scholars of other Catholic seats of learning in\r\nGermany, they habitually manifested contempt for the _Doctores Romani_,\r\nthe imported pupils of the Jesuits from the _Collegium Germanicum_ or\r\nother seminaries in Rome--a feeling which they extended to the great\r\nbulk of the men of the Curia.\r\n\r\nDöllinger had been a firm Tridentine Romanist, devoutly bearing the\r\nburden of the new dogmas which the Council of Trent bound up and laid\r\nupon men's shoulders. But being profoundly versed in antiquity, he was\r\nnot disposed for more accretions of the same sort, and he had long been\r\ndetested by the Jesuits, as standing in the old paths and resisting\r\ntheir innovations. Superstitions newly carried over the Alps did not\r\nthrive under his eye. As a historian he had not feared to narrate and\r\ncensure the enormities of Popes.\r\n\r\nWhile these agitations were arising in the provinces, the secret\r\npreparations in Rome were being pushed forward. The fact became known\r\nthat the six Commissions were at work. The names of those serving upon\r\nthem no sooner transpired than a cry arose that only favourites of the\r\nJesuits were appointed. So few names from Germany appeared that offence\r\nwas given, even in a national point of view. This feeling increased\r\nwhen it appeared that celebrities of whom the Catholic faculties were\r\nproud had been passed over, and that inferior men, known only for\r\ndevotion to the Curia, had been selected. These feelings were partly\r\ntheological, partly personal, and yet more strongly patriotic. The\r\nGermans knew that a double peril for the Fatherland lurked in the\r\nanti-unionist policy of Rome--peril of disruption from within, and of\r\ninvasion from France.\r\n\r\nDissatisfaction must have run tolerably high when Cardinal Prince\r\nSchwarzenberg wrote to Cardinal Antonelli, formally remonstrating as\r\nto the selection made. The fact, he submitted, that all those selected\r\nbelonged to one well-defined theological school, was in itself open to\r\nobjection. As to the reputation of the favourites, he said, \"I have had\r\nfears lest their qualifications should not prove equal to their weighty\r\nresponsibilities.\" He names Munich, Bonn, and Tübingen, as Universities\r\nwhere fit men were to be found as well as at Würzburg, and goes so far\r\nas to mention names, among them that of Döllinger.\r\n\r\nThis letter was politely answered by Antonelli, after a couple of\r\nmonths. He said that Döllinger would have been invited only that his\r\nHoliness had learned that he would not accept the duty.[138]\r\n\r\nOne of the theologians at whom the innuendo of Cardinal Schwarzenberg\r\nwas aimed was Hergenröther. Yet Archbishop Manning wrote to\r\n_Macmillan's Magazine_, and, after speaking of the men of Munich as\r\nif they were of little more account in the esteem of students than in\r\nthat of ecclesiastical courtiers, told us that if we wanted to learn\r\nanything of the true relation of Catholics to national law, we must not\r\ngo to them, but must study Hergenröther.[139]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: Menzel, _Weltbegebenheiten_, Band i. p. 123.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: Menzel, _Jesuitenumtriebe_, p. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: Quoted by Montalembert, _Bibliothèque Universelle_ 1876,\r\np. 194.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: Ibid. p. 195.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: _Bibliothèque Universelle de Lausanne_, 1876, p. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: Friedberg, _Aktenstücke_, p. 300.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: Ibid. p. 302.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: Ibid. pp. 313-23.

The _Civiltá Cattolica_, in the letter of\r\nits French correspondent, published suggestions that the Council\r\nshould sit for but a short time, that it should proclaim the doctrines\r\nof the Syllabus, and that the infallibility of the Pope should be\r\nadopted by acclamation. It was at once alleged that the finger of Pius\r\nhimself gave this sign. The suggestions thus made explain what the\r\nCardinals consulted in the first instance meant when they hoped that\r\nthe Council would not last so long as some might think. They had in\r\n1854 induced the bishops to acclaim a new dogma, and in 1867 to accept\r\nthe Syllabus without demur, and surely they could get any portions\r\nof that document which it was necessary, for greater clearness,\r\nto formulate into decrees, passed in the same delightful way; and\r\nthis would be still more desirable for the dogma of infallibility.\r\nArchbishop Manning treated the idea of an intended acclamation as a\r\npleasantry; but he charged the ventilation of it on a wrong time and\r\non a wrong publication. \"_Janus_ first announced the discovery of the\r\nplot.\"[140] It may have been _Janus_ who first clearly indicated a\r\ncertain English prelate as the man chosen by the party of acclamation\r\nto give the signal. But he was long behind the first to announce the\r\nplot. The laity generally were offended and alarmed, at least those\r\nnorth of the Alps, and many bishops who were ready to vote for the\r\nCuria did not feel flattered at having the whole world informed that\r\nthey were not wanted in Rome as judges of the faith, but as adornments\r\nof a grand pageant. The translation or assumption of the body of the\r\nVirgin was also suggested in the same article, as a doctrine which it\r\nwas desirable to make into a dogma.\r\n\r\nAs time wore on, the excitement became more intense. In France, the\r\naction of the government, as in most things under the Second Empire,\r\nwas ambiguous. It seemed to dread the impending innovations, and\r\nevery now and then what appeared to the world as a menace was half\r\nuttered. Yet it was plain that the Curia was not disturbed. Nothing\r\ncan be more tranquil than the letters in the _Civiltá_ from its French\r\ncorrespondent. There is an apparent sense of solid support, such as\r\nno gusts of the popular winds will seriously shake. M. de Banneville,\r\nthe acceptable representative of France in Rome, continued in his\r\npost. When the question of the presence of princes in the Council was\r\nto be faced, Cardinal Antonelli had the comfort of treating it with\r\nthis trusty friend. It was comparatively easy to convey to him the\r\nintimation which, in a few words, represented, as M. Veuillot had\r\nshowed, a radical revolution in Church and State. _There were no more\r\nCatholic States._ The term \"Catholic arms\" continued to be applied,\r\nby official writers, to those of France and the other countries which\r\nhad reconquered the lost States of the Pope. But arms are perhaps,\r\nlike gold and silver to the Brahmans, substances which never contract\r\npollution. The monarchs were outside the door. Even France, whose flag\r\nat Civitá Vecchia was the only protection of the temporal power, was\r\ntold that she was no longer a Catholic State--she, the eldest daughter\r\nof the Church; she whom the Pope, in parting with General Failly, had\r\nfor love of her chassepots--the \"prodigious chassepots,\" as they were\r\ncalled--blessed as the \"most Christian nation!\" The Curia knew that\r\nthe hold of the Pope on the priests and schools was stronger than that\r\nof the Bonapartes on army and nation; and they were rearing up their\r\nchampions, while the Empire was wearing out its own.\r\n\r\nThe same number of the _Civiltá_ which records the death of Antonelli\r\nstates the case in the following terms. The Pontiff could not invite\r\npowers \"of which one, like Italy, was in open hostility to the Church;\r\nof which another had, like Austria, of her own motion, torn up the\r\nConcordat; and another had, like France, a turncoat and a perfidious\r\ntraitor to the Holy See upon the throne.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ultramontane priests enjoyed this disfranchisement of kings; but\r\nthey were not yet all prepared to find that the Order of Priests was\r\nalso to be disfranchised. Not a man of them was to be allowed to plead\r\nin presence of the Council. The Cardinals, in their close and still\r\nCommissions, were preparing to put, not only laymen, but priests and\r\nbishops too, more on the footing of a marching army than ever before.\r\n\r\nOn April 9, 1869, Prince Hohenlohe addressed a circular to the\r\nEuropean Cabinets in the name of Bavaria. It was not to be believed,\r\nhe said, that the Council would confine itself to purely theological\r\nquestions, of which, in fact, none were pressing for solution. The\r\nonly dogmatic point that Rome wished the Council to decide was that of\r\nPapal infallibility, for which the Jesuits in Germany and elsewhere\r\nwere agitating. \"This question,\" added the Prince, \"reaches far beyond\r\nthe domain of religion, and is in its nature highly political; for the\r\npower of the Pope in temporal things over all princes and nations, even\r\nsuch as are in separation from Rome, would be defined, and elevated\r\ninto an article of faith.\"\r\n\r\nThe smooth reply of the German Jesuit organ was that something of the\r\nkind had been said before in the _Augsburg Gazette_. But the circle\r\nof Church authority would remain the same, whether the organ of that\r\nauthority should be the Pope singly, or the Pope in conjunction with\r\nthe bishops; just as the powers of a national government would be the\r\nsame in extent, whether in the hands of a monarch or of a republican\r\nexecutive.\r\n\r\nThis is characteristic. The discussion was not about any proposal to\r\nenlarge or contract the theoretic circle of Church power, but about\r\na proposal to declare that the Pope alone, without the bishops, was\r\nthe depositary of that power. If the theory of Rome was correct, no\r\nextension of the circle of power was possible, but the depositary of\r\npower was now to be changed.\r\n\r\nIf, among ourselves, it was proposed to give the power of life and\r\ndeath to the Crown, without judge or jury, we might be told that the\r\npower of life and death was the same whether exercised by royal warrant\r\nor through the traditionary courts. The circle of power would not be\r\nextended.\r\n\r\nThe Bavarian note did not elicit a practical response from other\r\nCabinets. The reply of Austria was, perhaps, influenced by the fact\r\nthat Count Beust, then Prime Minister, was a Protestant. His despatch\r\nbears marks either of non-appreciation of the import of terms and\r\nacts, proceeding from the Vatican, such as would be natural in one\r\nnot trained to watch them, or of a desire to evade the gravity of the\r\nquestion. He thought it best to wait and to be on his guard.[141] On\r\nbehalf of Prussia, Bismarck also took up an attitude of observation,\r\nbut with more insight into the reasons for the suggestion of Prince\r\nHohenlohe. The Italian Government had expressed itself in favour of\r\ncommon action, but practically let things take their course. England\r\nnaturally declined to interfere. As to France, she thought herself\r\nprotected by the Concordat against all eventualities--another proof\r\nthat her statesmen handled affairs without mastering ideas. Perhaps not\r\none of them had read what Rome had lately been teaching as the true\r\ndoctrine of Concordats.\r\n\r\nThe _Unitá Cattolica_ (June 23), however, put this tranquil attitude of\r\nFrance in a different light--\r\n\r\n    Hohenlohe is sold to Prussia, and torments the Catholics of Bavaria\r\n    to push them to throw themselves into the arms of Prussia, where\r\n    Catholicism enjoys the utmost liberty, thanks to the fox-like\r\n    policy of Bismarck. This is known in Paris, and hence Napoleon\r\n    is said to have looked darkly on the perfidious proposals of the\r\n    Bavarian Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: _Priv.

Nevertheless each of them is a monument to an\r\nauthority obeyed by disciplined millions, as holding executive power\r\nboth in this world and the other. Once more were long Latin sentences\r\nfilled out to tell the faithful that he who had power to bind and\r\nto loose proclaimed to them, on the occasion of the Council, full\r\nremission of their sins, and indulgence, on condition of their visiting\r\ncertain basilicas, and saying certain prayers.[142] \"This pardon,\" says\r\nthe Archbishop of Florence, \"was to extend not only till the opening of\r\nthe Council, but through the whole of its continuance.\"[143] Millions\r\nwere thus put under the necessity of imbibing the conviction, that sin\r\nagainst our neighbour and our God admits of being cancelled in such a\r\nway, or else of seeming to believe what they did not believe, or of\r\nbowing and not asking themselves whether they believed it or not.\r\n\r\nAbout this time was inaugurated, with great display of dignitaries,\r\nmilitary and spiritual, a monument to two brothers Dufournel, who\r\nlie in S. Lorenzo. The monument bears all the emblems of martyrdom\r\nwhich the art of the catacombs can supply. Instead of the usual\r\nrequest to pray for the repose of the soul, into which Romanism\r\nfell from Christianity, stands the word of the early Christians,\r\n\"They rest\"--here applied because martyrdom had merited what grace\r\nwas no longer believed to give. Emmanuel Dufournel, on meeting the\r\nGaribaldians, shouted to his men, \"Here, lads, is the spot to die; in\r\nthe name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, forward!\" When\r\nexpiring, he said, \"I am pleased to see my blood flow from fourteen\r\nwounds for the glory of Holy Church.\" The people of Valentano, where\r\nhe died, said to his men, \"Let us kiss the bier; we do not come to\r\npray for his soul, but to commend ourselves to him\" (VII. vi. 547).\r\n\"Such\"--adds the reverend writer--\"such is the Christian instinct which\r\ndistinguishes between combatants in any other cause, however just, and\r\nthe heroes of the Christian religion.\" To develop instincts of this\r\nsort, it is impossible to conceive writing more skilfully adapted. And\r\nthese are the men who, at every breath, call the Italians Mussulmans!\r\n\r\nThe other brother, Diodato Dufournel--young, handsome, polished,\r\nrich--soon after the death of Alfred, met Father Gerlache at daylight\r\nentering St. Peter's: \"I go to say a mass for our dead on the Apostle's\r\ntomb.\" \"I go too,\" replied the Captain, and they entered the crypt.\r\nThe priest asked the zouave what had caused his strange absorption in\r\nprayer. \"Father, I was praying to the Virgin for the favour of dying\r\nfor Holy Church.\" Ten days afterwards he fell mortally wounded during\r\nthe Garibaldian disturbance in Rome. When the white-headed father\r\narrived, it was too late to see either son alive, but he was instantly\r\nreceived by the Pope. The sovereign tried to fasten on his breast the\r\norder of the Piano, but was blinded by his tears. Maria, the sister\r\nof Diodato and Emmanuel, came between the two weeping old men, and,\r\nguiding the hand of the Pope, fastened the decoration on the breast\r\nof her father. The writer concludes by representing the ladies of\r\nthe house hereafter as pointing out to their little ones the glove,\r\nthe sword, the fatal ball, and other relics, the victor palm and the\r\nexulting angels, and saying, \"Their souls are in paradise, lovely and\r\nresplendent, and are interceding for us. Children, kneel down and\r\npray to God that none of our family may degenerate from the example of\r\nDiodato and Emmanuel Dufournel!\"\r\n\r\nBishop Senestrey, of Regensburg, known as a pupil of the Jesuits and\r\nan ardent Ultramontane, made a speech at Schwandorf, which has not yet\r\nbeen forgotten in Bavaria, and was soon heard of in other parts of\r\nGermany. He said--\r\n\r\n    We Ultramontanes cannot yield. The antagonism can have no issue\r\n    but in war and revolution. A peaceable settlement is not possible.\r\n    Who makes your temporal laws? We observe them only because a force\r\n    stands behind which compels us. True laws come from God only.\r\n    Princes themselves reign by the grace of God, and when they have\r\n    no longer a mind to do so, I shall be the first to overturn the\r\n    throne.[144]\r\n\r\nTo the Germans, who were just rising to a consciousness of their unity,\r\nthe threats of breaking them up again were cruel, especially when\r\ncoming from within. \"The foreigner,\" said Sepp, \"has always counted on\r\nthe internal splits in the German oak, to drive in his wedge, and rend\r\nus to pieces.\"\r\n\r\nThe scorn with which talk of recognizing Italy was treated at this\r\nproud moment, may be judged from the words of the _Unitá_ for January\r\n27, in an article headed, _Dying with Italy or Living with the Pope_.\r\nThe Marquis de Moustier, it remarks, having promised to study a _modus\r\nvivendi_, proposed by Menabrea, was seized by mortal illness. In a\r\nsimilar way Morny, Wallewsky, Petri, and Billault were struck with\r\ndeath, by urgent study of means for making revolution live side by side\r\nwith the Pope.\r\n\r\nParliamentary government, hateful everywhere, was viewed as monstrous\r\nin Italy. The _Civiltá_ cannot \"accurately study\" the proceedings in\r\nFlorence, because of \"the ineffable weariness, the disgust, the disdain\r\nwith which the mind is seized, on reading those speeches, often vulgar,\r\nand running over with sophism and effrontery.\"[145] It proceeds to\r\nsay that the famous boons of 1789, _liberty of worship_, _liberty of\r\nmeeting_, _liberty of the Press_, and _liberty of instruction_, led in\r\npractice \"to the triumph of irreligion, to the tyranny of the State,\r\nto unbridled licence in handling through the Press the most sacred and\r\ninviolable rights, and to the barbarizing of the young by more infamous\r\nignorance.\" Yet, at the same time, it records with satisfaction efforts\r\nof its own friends to obtain liberty of instruction, after their ideal;\r\nthat is, the State giving up to the priest the control of what is\r\ntaught to its subjects with its own money.\r\n\r\nThe _Civiltá_ gloried in the disappearance of the Liberal Catholic\r\npriests, utterly extinguished, as it held, by the Syllabus and by the\r\nprospect of the Council. There might still linger some slight remnant\r\nof Liberal Catholics among the laity. But Catholics in Italy were now\r\nto be noted for their hope, their joy, and their perfect withdrawal\r\nfrom political life. They were no more to be found seeking situations\r\nfrom the government, but were all ardently drawing close to Pius IX.\r\nSince he uttered the \"prophetic word,\" Let us wait upon events, above\r\nall since the Council was summoned, they had betaken themselves to\r\npious works and to waiting on the hand of the Almighty.[146]\r\n\r\nIn the same publications which struggled against unity of nations, the\r\nloss of another unity was bitterly deplored. \"Catholic unity\" in Spain,\r\nhitherto existing by law, alas! exclaims the _Stimmen_, exists in\r\nfact no longer. By religious unity is meant the state of things which\r\nforbids men to worship God except under direction of the Pope. Massimo\r\nD'Azeglio exclaimed as to Italy, Religious unity is the only unity we\r\nhave left. We should say, No wonder!\r\n\r\nThe attempt to place the unity of Christians not in faith in Christ\r\nand manifestation of His spirit, but in subjection to one human being,\r\nhas had just the same results as had the attempt to place the unity of\r\nmankind in obedience to one sovereign, treating all who did not yield\r\nas enemies. Human unity is larger and nobler than one throne will ever\r\nshadow, and so is Christian unity. The lust of uniformity that erected\r\nthe Inquisition, fettered the Press, sentenced free opinion and free\r\nspeech to death, reformed the Decalogue, and laid bonds upon the Bible,\r\nhas never given a nation rest, and has only been an endless source of\r\ndivision and scepticism. Azeglio, in the same breath in which he speaks\r\nof this \"unity,\" calls Italy \"the ancient land of doubt,\" where even at\r\nthe time of the Reformation people thought little of Rome and nothing\r\nof Geneva. And the _Stimmen_ says that those Spaniards who had broken\r\ndown \"religious unity\" were \"not Protestants but sceptics.\"[147] So\r\nthat in both Italy and Spain the result of that uniformity which is no\r\nunity, was scepticism in religion and decay in politics.\r\n\r\nTo the race the bond of unity lies in a common Father, and to the\r\nChurch in a common Lord. In the one case and in the other the\r\nmaintenance of unity consists not in putting down variations, but in\r\ntreating them with brotherly regard.\r\n\r\nVery great political significance was lent by all the Papal Press to\r\nfestivities in honour of the Pope's fiftieth year of priesthood. The\r\ndemonstrations of devotion to him at this moment were fervent and\r\ngrand, and the supplies of money laid at his feet were immense. Great\r\ncare was taken by the _Civiltá_ to ridicule the idea of the _Opinione_\r\nthat these manifestations had nothing to do with politics. On the\r\ncontrary, cried the leaders of the \"good Press,\" humanity, bewildered\r\nand almost in despair, was hastening to the feet of the only deliverer.\r\nAll society needed a saviour, as every rational creature knew. \"The\r\nPontiff is now almost alone in the world, the representative of truth,\r\njustice, and good sense.\" And hence, the poor world, swimming in error,\r\nfraud and absurdity--\"the world sees in Pius IX a true master, a true\r\njudge, a true sovereign, and it cleaves to him as the bulwark of\r\nsociety.\" The Syllabus suffices to prove that the Pope alone declares\r\nthe truth: \"the Syllabus which burst like a thunderbolt out of a serene\r\nsky, both illuminated and blasted.\" The nations seem to be saying,\r\nTo whom _should we go_, but to the Supreme Pastor of the Christian\r\nflock?--_thou hast the words of eternal life_. Pius IX, by rejecting\r\nthe counsels of the prudent, \"now has become morally the strongest\r\nsupport of order in the world, so that those who have fallen, and\r\nthose who wish not to follow them, lean upon him.\" And not only so, but\r\nthe\r\n\r\n    new queen of the world, Public Opinion, is now altogether in favour\r\n    of the Roman Pontiff, and protects and saves him, almost of herself\r\n    alone, against every violence and every intrigue, so that it now\r\n    may almost be said that all those in the world who are not with\r\n    Pius IX from love are with him by force (VII. vi. pp. 310-11).\r\n\r\nThe writer then goes on to argue that the people can never understand\r\nhow one and the same person can have two consciences, one as a\r\nconstitutional king and the other as a man. This, however, is a\r\nnecessary condition of a constitutional king, but it is not the case in\r\nthe Pontifical States, where nobody would ever suppose such a condition\r\nof things possible.\r\n\r\n    The Pope has only one conscience, and neither majority nor\r\n    universality of votes and suffrages would ever lead him to sanction\r\n    that which is contrary to morality, to justice, to equity, and to\r\n    the well understood interests of his subjects and of the flock. The\r\n    Pope can say with truth, \"Although all, not I\"; and on this account\r\n    the eyes and the hearts of all in the world who hate fictions and\r\n    impostures, and who love truth and rectitude, are turned to the\r\n    Pope thus reigning and governing (p. 312).\r\n\r\nWe make no attempt to inquire how many consciences a Pope may have.\r\nThe _Civiltá_ contends that he cannot have more than one. We have\r\nheard Romans contend that one is above the number. Liverani (p. 140),\r\nalluding with much personal respect to Father Mignardi, the Jesuit\r\nconfessor of Cardinal Antonelli, who, though not Pope, had much to do\r\nwith the perfect model of government above commended, evidently thinks\r\nthat a director of Antonelli's conscience held a sinecure. He asserts\r\nthat no one knew that his Eminence had a conscience till April 2, 1860,\r\nwhen he declared the fact in a despatch to Count Cavour! And this is\r\nthe language of a prelate!\r\n\r\nThe more distant prelates were already bidding their flocks farewell.\r\nThe Bishop of Montreal, in doing so, cited the example of the valorous\r\nCanadian youths, who had enrolled themselves among the zouaves to\r\ndefend the Pope at the cost of their blood, exhorting his clergy with\r\nsimilar courage to contend against the errors pointed out by the\r\nPope.[148] From Jerusalem five priests wrote to announce that they\r\nwould commence a concert of prayer, on the slopes of Calvary: 1. For\r\nthe happy result of the Council; 2. For the union of the Oriental\r\nschismatics; 3. For the conversion of erring priests. At the same time\r\nthat it announces this fact, the _Civiltá_, quoting from the _Tablet_,\r\nsays that in Russia, \"under the appearance of _external unity_, there\r\nis great division of religious sects\"; and that there is some desire\r\nfor union with Rome.[149]\r\n\r\nIn June 1869 the Catholics of Coblentz presented an address to the\r\nBishop of Trêves, protesting against the innovations proposed by the\r\n_Civiltá Cattolica_, and suggesting reforms in a spirit contrary to\r\nthat of the Syllabus. Great interest was excited by the warm adhesion\r\nof Count Montalembert to the address. His services, both to the\r\nspiritual and temporal power, had been conspicuous. He was now in the\r\ngrip of a mortal disease. France will always respect his piety and his\r\ngenius, but she will increasingly have cause to deplore the direction\r\nof his influence, as the slow but sure results of priestly power in\r\neducation develop themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Twice within the last few weeks,\" he writes, \"have I touched the brink\r\nof the grave.\" So he feels that he may speak of this world as one whose\r\npersonal interest in it is as nought.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the address, he says: \"I cannot express how much I have\r\nbeen moved and charmed by that glorious manifesto, flowing from the\r\nreason and conscience of Catholics.... At last I seemed to hear a manly\r\nand a Christian tone, amid the declamations and adulations wherewith\r\nwe are deafened.\" He would have signed \"every line\" of it, but he felt\r\nsomewhat humbled that it did not proceed from French Catholics, with\r\nwhose antecedents it would have harmonized, as well as with those\r\nconvictions which made them, in the early part of this century, the\r\nchampions of religious liberty on the Continent.[150]\r\n\r\nIt was hard for the Jesuits to own that Montalembert stood in their\r\npath, to be pitilessly struck down. For the present they tried to\r\nreason. Like him, many, especially in Belgium, had imbibed the\r\nconviction that civil and religious liberty were good in themselves,\r\nand might be made to work favourably for the Church, which they thought\r\nincurred great danger by setting herself in opposition to both, and\r\nby using her spiritual engines for the overthrow of constitutional\r\ngovernment. Such men argued that the perfect liberty existing in\r\nEngland, the United States, and Belgium had many advantages for the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nTo reasoning of this sort the _Stimmen aus Maria Laach_ replied by\r\nfirst of all uttering encomiums on religious liberty, and also on\r\nthose excellent Catholics who favoured it, thinking it might prove\r\nbest for the Church. But though this view of the case had its noble\r\naspects, there was another side to it. Experience proved that under\r\nsuch a system the losses of the Church were deplorable. Not to speak\r\nof Europe, the case of the United States would suffice. As much as\r\nthirty years ago, Bishop England, of Charleston, had said that whereas\r\nthe Catholics ought to have six millions of the population, they\r\nreally had less than two. And this terrible loss was aggravated at the\r\npresent day, for considering the enormous immigration of Catholics\r\nand the addition of Mexican territory in the meantime, they ought now\r\nto number fifteen millions; but in fact they did not dare to claim\r\nmore than six. A good authority had showed that the Church lost more\r\nsouls in the State of Wisconsin in a single year, than she gained in\r\nthe whole Union. The loss among the children of the Irish was greater\r\nthan among those of the Germans. This the writer attributes to \"the\r\npestiferous air\" of non-denominational schools, and complains that the\r\nsystem prevailing in America deprives children of a well-ordered and\r\ncontinuous Catholic education, such as would protect them, among other\r\ndangers, from the necessity of learning English.[151]\r\n\r\nThis anxiety to keep up the German tongue in America illustrates the\r\ncry raised in the German Press against that tongue being put out of\r\nthe schools, both in Posen and in the Tyrol. \"Liberty of instruction\"\r\nhad been so used that whole districts, once speaking German, had been\r\neducated into the use of Polish in the one case, and of Italian in the\r\nother. In both these countries the same reason which in America made it\r\ndesirable for Rome to keep up German, turned the other way. In America,\r\nthe German tongue would enclose a people, in the heart of the country,\r\nwalled off and apart from the nation. In the other cases, that tongue\r\nwould be a channel connecting the people with the ebb and flow of the\r\nnational mind. Even a comparatively small population, kept well in\r\nhand, inaccessible to the common thought, and ready to obey every touch\r\nof the leaders, may be made a formidable political power. Had Wales\r\nbeen in the hand of Rome![152]\r\n\r\nAmong the causes of chagrin to Montalembert would be a recent article\r\nin the _Civiltá_, directed against the Liberal Catholics by name,\r\nand plainly meant to thwart any influence with which they might have\r\nhoped to approach the Council. A pamphlet being taken as a text, the\r\npositions of the Liberal Catholics are stated, as--1. That modern\r\nnations deserve more liberty than ancient ones; 2. That liberty of\r\nworship should be conceded, as now inevitable; 3. That \"the distinction\r\nbetween Church and State\" is not now to be got rid of, and has its\r\nadvantages; 4. That Catholics ought to avail themselves of all\r\nliberties. On the first point it is replied that modern society has\r\nmade only material progress, but gone back in faith and morals, and\r\ntherefore deserves not more liberty than ancient society, but less.\r\nOn the second point, resenting an allusion of the Liberal Catholic\r\nto the fact that Pius IX had himself granted a constitution at the\r\nopening of his reign, the _Civiltá_ alleges, first, that it was\r\nconceded _in circumstances of imperious necessity_; and, secondly,\r\nthat it was free from the essential faults which would deservedly\r\nbrand it as Liberal--\"it lacked the criminal principles of liberty of\r\nworship, of the Press, and of meeting.\" Moreover, it issued in the\r\nexile of the Prince, \"which seems to be the inevitable result of modern\r\nconstitutions.\" So the Pontiff was obliged to revoke it, and to condemn\r\nit to oblivion.\r\n\r\nThe Liberal Catholic writer had quoted passages, even from Jesuits,\r\nto prove that it was lawful for princes, in given circumstances, to\r\ntolerate liberty of worship. Certainly, replies the _Civiltá_, it is\r\nlawful to tolerate it, if imperious circumstances render it necessary\r\nin order to avoid a greater evil. But that is one thing, and admitting\r\nliberty of worship as a principle is another. \"What meaning have\r\nthe words of the present Pontiff when he declares that liberty of\r\nconscience and of worship is madness, and the pest of the nations?\"\r\nWhat did he mean when he condemned President Comonfort for admitting\r\nreligious liberty into Mexico? Did Gregory XVI and Pius IX talk to the\r\nmiddle ages? Did they tell the present generation what was suitable or\r\nnot suitable for the middle ages? Catholics may not be able to change\r\nthe state of things where liberty of worship already exists, but it\r\nis in their power to prevent its entrance where it does not, and to\r\ndemonstrate its criminality, and its moral and social balefulness. As\r\nto Catholics availing themselves of all liberties, that idea is no\r\npatent of _Liberal_ Catholics. Of course Catholics avail themselves\r\nof all liberties of which they can make use. But to take part in the\r\nelections of a kingdom like that of Italy, formed by iniquity, and\r\nbinding up in itself a perpetual sacrilege, is impossible. The words of\r\nthe Bull which hurled an excommunication against king and people, are\r\nparaded, and the unfortunate Liberal Catholic is reminded that those\r\nwords apply to _adherents_ of the spoliation.[153]\r\n\r\nA London correspondent of the _Civiltá_ told how the journals had at\r\nfirst affected to ignore the Council, but now began to speak of it.\r\nThe Anglo-Catholic party were discussing projects of union, and he\r\ngives an account of a meeting for that purpose, not naming time or\r\nplace, but making the Rev. Edward Urquhart prominent. It is said, he\r\nadds, that one bishop will go to the Council; and the Ritualists think\r\nthat many of their party will do so. There is much cause for hope.\r\nSome persons of high station have publicly said that they would submit\r\nto the Council, and many say so privately. They do not feel safe in\r\nAnglicanism.\r\n\r\nThe prelate who replaced the Bishop of Montreal in his absence,\r\ndelivered an address, from which the _Civiltá_ repeats these words,\r\nthat Pius IX had a mission, and his mission was to recall, to confirm,\r\nand to defend in the world, the law of the \"Most High,\" the essential\r\nprinciple of authority, and thus to \"save at once both the Church and\r\nSociety.\"[154] But as a while ago we heard of toasts in which the Pope,\r\nas universal king, was put before the national king, so now on British\r\nground is held up to admiration the trophy of banners in the Church\r\nof St. Sulpice as the fairest tribute of \"New France,\" as Canada is\r\ncalled. The flags of all the societies in Montreal, and also those of\r\nall nations, were gathered together \"_in homage to the standard of Pius\r\nIX, to express the obedience of the Catholic nations to the supreme\r\nauthority_.\"[155]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: _Acta_, p. 18.

A book under the title of _The Pope and the Council_, by\r\nJanus, issued from the German press; and conjecture at once ascribed\r\nthe principle authorship to no less a person than Döllinger, although\r\nit was assumed that he had availed himself of aid. The profound\r\nimpression made by this work may be accounted for, partly by the\r\nexcitement in the midst of which it appeared, and partly by its own\r\nforce. It combined a minute knowledge of the inner history of the\r\nChurch, with comprehensive views of the questions, both doctrinal and\r\nconstitutional, which were now raised.\r\n\r\nAfter a few clear passages from modern utterances of authority. Janus\r\nstrikes the keynote rather higher than he is prepared to sustain\r\nit--\"So they find themselves under a delusion, who believed that in the\r\nChurch, the spirit of the Bible, and of old Christianity, had got the\r\nupper hand of that spirit of the middle ages according to which she was\r\na penal establishment, able to send men to prison, to the gallows, or\r\nto the stake.\"\r\n\r\nBeginning with the _Magna Charta_ which Innocent III condemned, while\r\nhe excommunicated the Barons, Janus cites case after case in which\r\nthe establishment of free institutions, and especially of freedom of\r\nworship, brought down the solemn condemnation of the Pope. The case\r\nof Austria in 1868 is the latest. With the quietness of scientific\r\nknowledge, he states what at the time would have required from an\r\nEnglish writer arguments and proofs in detail, namely, the simple but\r\nmost important fact that the oft-quoted word of the Apostle, \"We must\r\nobey God rather than men,\" means, in the Jesuit sense, We must obey\r\nthe Pope as the representative of God upon earth, and the infallible\r\ninterpreter of the Divine will, rather than any civil superior, or any\r\nlaw of the State (p. 33).\r\n\r\nThe tone of Janus is calm and scholarly, without being cold; and\r\nthe acuteness of his analysis is such as is found only where clear\r\nintellectual insight is united to trained habits of weighing language\r\nwith reference to possible interpretations by such casuists as are\r\nformed by the Curia and the Jesuits.\r\n\r\nHe clearly proved that the Church was on the eve of one of the greatest\r\nconstitutional changes ever effected in any commonwealth. If, in the\r\npast, the forged Decretals of the pseudo-Isidore had facilitated\r\ninroads upon the constitution of the Church, how much more would an\r\nauthentic article of the creed, containing in itself the power of\r\nmaking any number of other articles, and assuming as its basis the\r\nunlimited authority of the Pope, pave the way to far-reaching civil and\r\necclesiastical encroachments! When Archbishop Manning said of Janus\r\nthat by some it was \"regarded as the shallowest and most pretentious\r\nbook of the day\" (_Priv. Pet._, iii. p. 114), he greatly moderated\r\nthe tone of his Continental friends. Most bad things that could be\r\nsaid against a book, or its writers, were said in very bad language.\r\nThe Archbishop himself could not let it pass without twice calling it\r\n\"infamous,\" and that in a pastoral.\r\n\r\nThe excitement in Germany now reached a point at which the bishops\r\nbegan to be alarmed. The \"good Press\" undertook to extenuate the\r\nimportance of the changes dreaded, and threw doubts on the probability\r\nof their being adopted. The perplexity became greater when, in France,\r\nappeared a book in two volumes from the pen of Monsignor Maret, said\r\nby some to be the most learned prelate in the country, and who, at\r\nall events, was Dean of the Theological Faculty of the Sorbonne. He\r\ncombated the proposed innovations with French tact and skill, raising\r\na voice, if not for the old Gallican doctrines as a whole, at least\r\nfor some remains both of them and of the liberties with which are\r\nidentified the names of the most renowned Churchmen in France since\r\nthe Reformation.[156] The book made a profound but passing impression.\r\nIt was called _Religious Peace and the General Council_; but the\r\nJesuit historian Sambin (p. 47) styles it a brand increasing the\r\nconflagration. The question raised was that between a constitutional\r\nbut oligarchical government and a personal one for the Church. Maret\r\nholds that in her constitution a check upon the monarch was provided\r\nby the \"aristocracy,\" that is, the bishops (vol. ii, p. 107). The\r\ndemocracy is formed by the priests and the laity. But we may point\r\nout that this is very loose language. _Democracy_ means a people with\r\npower, not a populace excluded from all functions of government. The\r\npeople in the Papal Church are absolutely stripped of all part in\r\ngovernment. They are a mere populace. The clergy are disfranchised\r\nofficials. That Church is a society with a populace, but without\r\na democracy. Before the Vatican Council, it had a constitutional\r\naristocracy. Since then, the bishops are nobles without any but\r\ndelegated power. Maret clearly states the familiar fact, that in the\r\nearlier centuries both clergy and laity took part in the election of\r\nbishops. But when he comes to speak of the part taken by kings in their\r\nelection, the facts glide out of sight, as noiselessly as writers of\r\nhis school generally say that they are wont to do in the hands of a\r\nJesuit. A reader might imagine that kings first got the idea of a right\r\nin the election of bishops by some grant of the Church; whereas even\r\nthe Bishops of Rome were for a long time elected on imperial or royal\r\norder, coming from Greek or Goth, from Arian or orthodox prince, as the\r\ncase might be.\r\n\r\nMaret quotes Cardinal de la Luzerne as saying that a General\r\nCouncil, in which the order of priests was not represented, would be\r\nillegitimate though not invalid (vol. i. p. 125); and gives it as the\r\ngeneral opinion of theologians that their presence was _necessary_. He\r\nalso admits that the presence of laymen in the Councils is attested by\r\na large number of documents.\r\n\r\nVon Schulte reviewed this work in the _Literaturblat_ of Bonn (v.\r\npp. 2 and 54). Looking at it in a popular sense, Schulte thought it\r\nwas a book to mark an epoch. It was likely to produce a great effect\r\namong the clergy, little among the laity. Time has not justified this\r\nanticipation. The fact is, all the younger clergy had been educated\r\nout of French ideas and sympathies, and such of the young laity too as\r\nhad been brought up by priests. Men were but beginning to find how the\r\nChristian Brothers, and convent schools, and episcopal seminaries had\r\nchanged France.\r\n\r\nThe _Civiltá_, in reply, objects even to Maret's formula, _the Pope\r\nwith the bishops superior to himself alone_. Such an objection implies\r\nthat in Council all the bishops add to the Pope nothing at all. So\r\nmany mitres without any heads in them would add at least as much. We\r\nbelieve, indeed, that great thinkers have doubted whether a judge with\r\nhis wig is not superior to the same judge without his wig. But the Pope\r\nwith all the bishops is not superior to the Pope without any bishop!\r\nThe Jesuit writer says that he thinks he expresses the mind of Maret\r\nwith exactness when he puts it thus, _The supreme power resides in the\r\nPope together with the bishops; in the Pope as supreme, whose strict\r\nduty it is nevertheless, to obey; in the bishops as subordinate, who,\r\nnevertheless, have the right to command_ (_Civiltá_, VII. viii. p. 257\r\nff.).\r\n\r\nThe choicest auditories of Paris had often crowded noble Notre Dame,\r\nquaffing with delight the sparkling eloquence of the Carmelite preacher\r\nHyacinthe. Now the ear of the country was thrilled for a moment, by\r\na cry from that eloquent voice. \"By an abrupt change,\" he wrote to\r\nthe General of his order on September 20, 1869, \"for which I blame\r\nnot your own feelings, but a party in Rome, you now accuse what you\r\ndid encourage, and blame what you did approve, commanding me to hold\r\na language, or to preserve a silence, which would not represent my\r\nconscience.\"\r\n\r\nPlaced in this difficulty, he must forsake General, order, and convent.\r\nHe continues: \"My profound conviction is, that if France in particular,\r\nand the Latin races in general, are delivered over to social,\r\nmoral, and religious anarchy, the principal cause is, not assuredly\r\nCatholicism itself, but the manner in which it has been understood and\r\npractised for a long time.\"[157]\r\n\r\nSt. Peter's Day, always a great day in Rome, was, of course, of\r\nsurpassing importance in the year of the Council. The _Civiltá_\r\ncelebrated it in an article very like one of the Pope's Speeches.\r\nThis article yields an example of a dualism in the government of\r\nthe universe which must glide in as the unconscious but inevitable\r\ncomplement of the doctrine into which Papal writers fall, in explaining\r\naway what to others seems the blight of Providence on whatever they\r\nrule according to their own principles. They begin by separating the\r\nGod of Providence from the God of grace. They end by turning the\r\nbounties of Providence into the bribes of the evil one. It will be seen\r\nthat in what follows national prosperity comes from the devil. The\r\nincrease of our fields, the blessing in our basket and our store, are\r\nin reality a curse. This, though unseen to the poor Pope who teaches\r\nsuch things, presents a true and a very hurtful form of Manicheism. It\r\nis another proof that they who readily forge and hurl bad names are not\r\nsafe from the errors which those names when correctly used denote.\r\n\r\nIn June the Curia had to set up a strong resistance to the movement\r\noriginated in Austria for the abrogation of the Concordat. That\r\ninstrument, which had formed the diplomatic triumph of Cardinal\r\nRauscher and had crowned the professional reputation of Schulte,\r\nhad legally restored to the Papal Church much of what it calls its\r\nliberties; but the clergy complained that they never practically got\r\nall that was promised upon paper; In the _Frond_ biographies of the\r\nCardinals, that of Rauscher describes the condition of the Church in\r\nAustria, under the Josephine laws, as deplorable! Instead of leaving\r\nher, like Protestant Prussia, to manage her own affairs, without having\r\ndefined either what \"manage\" or \"her own\" meant, Austria, knowing\r\nhow Rome interprets, had taken a different course. There was left,\r\naccording to our authority, no canon law, but only such legislation as\r\nwas imbued with Febronianism and Caesarism. Bulls, briefs, rescripts,\r\nand even the pastorals of bishops were subject to the royal _placet_.\r\nMarriage was withdrawn from under the control of the Church. The\r\nState pushed into everything, \"and the Catholic Church had none of\r\nthe liberties claimed by the tolerance of the age for all religions.\"\r\nRauscher had succeeded in getting these grievances redressed, but\r\nnow the national spirit was rising against his work. His Concordat\r\nbound Austria to concede to the Church \"all rights and privileges to\r\nwhich by the divine order and by canon law she is entitled.\" Probably\r\nthe Emperor but imperfectly comprehended what that implied. Rauscher\r\ncomprehended it. He was as honest a man as any Papal priest is likely\r\nto be. He was the adviser of the Emperor, and his sworn personal\r\nfriend. Any one may tell what such friends do for princes who will only\r\nmaster what Rauscher managed to bind his sovereign to. The minister,\r\nVon Hasner, put the plea for the abrogation of the Concordat on ground\r\nexceedingly offensive to the Pope and those around him. When the\r\nConcordat was contracted, said Hasner, Rome was an independent State.\r\nNow, it has ceased to be so, and is sustained only by foreign arms.\r\nThe reply from the Vatican was: So long as the Pope is sustained by\r\nChristian arms, he can never be sustained by those of foreigners.\r\nThe reply of the politician would have been that in 1855, when the\r\nConcordat was concluded, the Papal State was as much dependent upon\r\nforeign arms as in 1867, the only difference being that at the former\r\ntime the arms holding a great portion of it were those of Austria.\r\n\r\nOn the anniversary of the Pope's accession, his speech, addressed to\r\nthe Sacred College, contained the following passage: \"The two societies\r\nof which the world consists,\" said his Holiness, are, first, the Tower\r\nof Pride, i.e. Babel; secondly, the society whose prototype is seen \"in\r\nthe upper room, on the day of Pentecost, where Peter, the Apostles,\r\nand thousands of the faithful of different nations, heard one and the\r\nsame language and understood it.\" Those who wish to form a clear idea\r\nof what these two organs of two hostile societies are--the Babel tongue\r\nand the Pentecostal tongue--must just keep their eyes open as we go on.\r\n(_Civiltá_, VII. vii. p. 130.)\r\n\r\nThe Pope, on June 25, calling governments before \"his tribunal,\" and\r\nsitting in judgment, pronounced censure on the governments of Italy,\r\nAustria, Spain, and Russia. Italy was discussing a law to subject\r\nstudents even for the priesthood to the conscription. Austria was\r\nmiserably wronging and injuring the Church. Spain was doing likewise,\r\nor worse. And Russia was persecuting the Polish bishops and sending\r\nthem into exile. The high spirits of the Court at this moment appear\r\nin the comments on these sentences. We give a few specimens from the\r\n_Civiltá_ (VII. vii. p. 135, etc.)--\r\n\r\n    From no other lips could those words burst forth, save from those\r\n    of him who is set by God as ruler of His Church, with divine power,\r\n    above all human powers.... Only the Pope can thus menace, reprove,\r\n    and instruct, because he only is set in a region above all human\r\n    greatness between heaven and earth.... When science gloried in\r\n    being Catholic, and authority in being derived from God, both were,\r\n    when they spoke, echoes of the word of the Pope. But science and\r\n    authority have become unchristianized. The Pope has remained what\r\n    he was--the herald, the oracle of the Lord.\r\n\r\nThe article proceeded to show that the Pope had menaced in the same\r\nbreath one republic, Spain; two constitutional monarchies, Italy and\r\nAustria; and one absolute monarchy, Russia. This could not be done\r\nunless the Pope was king. Then follows a specimen of history as it\r\nflourishes under Pius IX. The Roman Emperors used to imprison the\r\nPopes, in order to reign in Rome; and Constantine, _not wishing to\r\nimprison_ the Pope, abandoned Rome. But a king not Pope, and a Pope not\r\nking, never were able to live here together, and never will be able to\r\ndo so. (_Civiltá_, VII. vii. p. 131 ff.)\r\n\r\nGreat attention was awakened by the prominence given by the _Civiltá_\r\n(p. 210) to a publication of Bishop Plantier, of _Nimes_. It was\r\n\"splendid and profound.\" Plantier spoke of the suggestion that the\r\ntwo doctrines of Papal infallibility and the assumption of the Virgin\r\nshould be defined by acclamation. He alleged that such a mode of\r\ndefinition could be conveniently and infallibly adopted, and asked\r\nif the Council should adopt it, what would be the harm? He ridiculed\r\nthe idea that the assistance of the Holy Spirit would be given to a\r\ndecision by vote and not to one by acclamation. The appearance of this\r\nin the _Civiltá_, after all that had passed, quickened the fears of the\r\nanti-infallibilists and also of the anti-opportunists lest the Pope\r\nshould be determined to carry through the definition by acclamation.\r\n\r\nEarly in September the bishops of Germany met at Fulda, and issued\r\na collective pastoral. They solemnly deprecated the rumours spread\r\nabroad as to the intentions of the Council. The bishops went on to\r\nasseverate that the Council would never define any new doctrine which\r\nwas not contained in holy writ or in tradition, but would define\r\nonly principles which were written \"on all your hearts by faith and\r\nconscience\" (_Friedberg_, p. 276). The Catholics of Germany took this\r\nsolemn language in its apparent meaning; and the persuasion that their\r\nbishops would stand fast, and that the Curia would not ride roughshod\r\nover such a body, tranquillized most men. Only ecclesiastics appear\r\nto have suspected that the assurance might amount to little more than\r\ncarefully dovetailed words.\r\n\r\nThe German bishops, in giving the assurance that nothing but what\r\nthe faithful believed would be defined, probably hoped that the fact\r\nof their having to give such an assurance would weigh at Rome, as a\r\nhindrance to the plans in contemplation. If so, they only furnished\r\none more proof of the truth which we in England have been told by Dr.\r\nNewman, that _no pledge from Catholics is of any value to which Rome is\r\nnot a party_.[158]\r\n\r\nIf the German bishops read as little as Dr. Friedrich says they do,\r\nthey perhaps do not read the _Unitá Cattolica_. There is no doubt that\r\nit, at least, speaks language agreeable in the highest quarters. In its\r\nnumber for the preceding 1st of May, it commented on the same assurance\r\nas having been flung before the French people. \"If the Council,\" says\r\nthis real echo, \"should only define what all believe, the Council would\r\nbe useless, for in points which all believe all are agreed.\" To say,\r\nit proceeds, that an OEcumenical Council should express what all the\r\nfaithful think, is to confound the Teaching Church with the Learning\r\nChurch. \"The pen falls from our hands, and we have not courage to\r\ncontend against such nonsense.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having put this assurance before their nation, certain of the\r\nbishops felt it necessary to address a private appeal to the Pope,\r\ndrawn up by Dinkel, Bishop of Augsburg, representing the great danger\r\nto the Church in Germany which the proposed alterations would involve,\r\nand praying him to abandon \"the far-reaching projects which were\r\nascribed to him.\"[159] A similar appeal was sent to his Holiness by\r\nthe prelates of Hungary, in which country a notable commencement had\r\nbeen made in restoring the laity to a part in the management of Church\r\naffairs.[160]\r\n\r\nIn June 1869 a remarkable meeting of Catholic notables was held in\r\nBerlin; with an account of which Sepp opens his book. The chair was\r\nfilled by Peter Reichensperger, since noted for his Ultramontane zeal,\r\nand Herr Windhorst, now the Ultramontane leader in the Reichstag, was\r\npresent, with even Dr. Jörg, of Bavaria, whose allusion, in the winter\r\nof 1874, to the attempt of Kullman on the life of Bismarck called forth\r\na remarkable speech from that statesman. These gentlemen, thinking, or\r\nprofessing to think, that their bishops would defeat what the Curia had\r\nplanned, adopted an address expressive of confidence in them, and of\r\ntheir hope that the threatened collision between the Church and their\r\ngovernments and nation might be averted.\r\n\r\nSepp himself went to Prague to present the document to Cardinal Prince\r\nSchwarzenberg. The latter read it slowly, thought it over, and said,\r\n\"It is far too weak. With Rome you must hold very different language\r\nfrom that.\" In further conversation Sepp said to the Cardinal, \"You\r\nhave in Prague the first canonist in Germany (Schulte), the man who\r\ndrafted the Austrian Concordat, and surely he can be employed in\r\nsimilar work for the Council.\" The reply was: \"You have in Munich the\r\ngreatest Catholic theologian in Germany, and the gentlemen in Rome will\r\nnot hear of his being invited\" (_Sepp_, p. 4).\r\n\r\nLarge numbers of priests had been returned to the Bavarian Parliament,\r\nall burning with zeal against Prussia, and against union under it. In\r\n1868 the clerical agitation had gone so far that, in November of that\r\nyear, President Badhauser, when closing the Landsrath, addressed the\r\nmembers in unwonted language--\r\n\r\n    When the government of the country and its organs, the chamber\r\n    which represents the people, and the new laws, are daily held up to\r\n    suspicion, mockery, and contempt, when the peasantry are excited\r\n    against the townspeople, and when men, throwing off all patriotic\r\n    shame, feed themselves with hopes of foreign intervention,\r\n    threatening our German warriors with the chassepots, then must\r\n    every honourable man condemn such proceedings; for the venom daily\r\n    instilled will, in time, poison the honest country people, as\r\n    occurrences in Upper Bavaria already show.[161]\r\n\r\nSecret associations for Ultramontane objects were formed even among\r\nchildren. Those of the clergy who would have warned the authorities\r\nwere still kept still by secret terrorism. The meeting of the Council\r\nand the necessity of overthrowing Prince Hohenlohe were closely\r\nconnected with this turmoil. And the Liberals plainly said, \"The whole\r\nCatholic world is to be fanaticized, to enable the great Catholic\r\npowers, after crushing Prussia, as they hope to do, to carry out a\r\ngrand reaction.\"[162]\r\n\r\nThe _Vaterland_ went so far, when Napoleon III took his last\r\n_plébiscite_, as to tell its readers that a French intervention in\r\nGermany would soon follow, that it was eagerly looked for, and that\r\nall would join France to break the hated yoke of Prussia. Morally,\r\nPrussia was already at an end, but it was for France to put an end\r\nto her physically. \"Who can tell if we shall have any North German\r\nConfederation, Zollverein, or Prussian monarchy in 1871?\"[163] Similar\r\nhopes of great events often pointed to the year of the Council, or the\r\nyear after. The _Civiltá_ did not scruple to tell Napoleon III that he\r\nowed the new _plébiscite_ to Mentana. So far from concealing the Pope's\r\ndirect action in a question affecting the stability of a throne, his\r\nconfidential writers exaggerated his influence.\r\n\r\nIn Austria a struggle had set in against the supernatural order. Laws\r\non civil marriage, education, and registry of baptism were passed by\r\nthe legislature, and tardily assented to by the Emperor. The Bishop of\r\nLinz issued a manifesto saying that he would not acknowledge the new\r\nillegitimate laws--of course under the plea of obeying God rather than\r\nman. Turning on the Emperor, he said that he had pledged his faith\r\nto the Concordat as a man and as a kaiser. Other prelates, in milder\r\nlanguage, set Papal above Austrian law. Finally, as we have already\r\nseen, on June 22, 1868, the Pope himself laid the new laws under his\r\ncondemnation.\r\n\r\nA Catholic meeting against the school law was being held in the church\r\nat Schlanders, and while the curate was making a speech Count Manzano,\r\nthe local authority, declared the meeting closed. Cries of \"Down with\r\nhim! kill him!\" were raised. He was thrown to the ground, beaten on the\r\nbreast, and barely escaped to the barracks of the gensdarmes.\r\n\r\nWhen the Council was closely approaching, great excitement broke out\r\nin Austria against the religious orders. The spark which kindled the\r\nblaze was the discovery of a nun confined in the Carmelite convent of\r\nCracow. She had been kept in one cell for twenty years, with incredible\r\nprivations and in bestial filth. The rage of the public forced the\r\ngovernment to go as far as some show of action. Orders were issued for\r\nthe inspection of convents. Sentences of bishops condemning priests to\r\nconfinement in ecclesiastical prisons were declared invalid unless the\r\nculprit voluntarily consented. The bishops were also required to give\r\nin lists of the voluntary prisoners.\r\n\r\nThese measures were resented as an \"insult to the episcopate.\" The\r\nBishop of Brünn won himself an honourable mention in the _Civiltá_ by\r\na circular in which he repelled the pretensions of the government,\r\nrefused the list required, and told the superiors of monasteries to pay\r\nno heed to the orders. While this second government was set up, beside\r\nthat of the country, the voice of Rome cheered it on in taking the\r\nupper hand. The same voice railed against the constitutional ministers,\r\nthe parliament, and the laws.\r\n\r\nThe combative Bishop of Linz, in a great meeting, said that he did not\r\ncast any doubt on the religious feeling of the Emperor, but he was now\r\nnothing more than a constitutional sovereign. Instead, therefore, of\r\nmerely saying that they had confidence in the Emperor, they must come\r\nto his aid. This was repeated in Rome, with the explanation that it\r\nhad been said that the bishop in this appeal for aid to the Emperor\r\nwas only uttering the sentiments of his Majesty as expressed to the\r\nbishop. Thus were bishops commended by the organ of the Papal Court for\r\nbreaking the laws of their country, and credited with influencing the\r\nmind of the sovereign in a sense hostile to the constitution.[164]\r\n\r\nThe Ultramontane party had frequently, during the year (1868) been\r\nencouraged by correspondents in Paris to expect a war of France against\r\nPrussia. On March 10, the _Unitá_ contained a letter expressing fears\r\nthat Austria and Italy might agree to remain neutral, but quoting a\r\npassage from the _Volksbote_ in favour of French invasion of Germany.\r\nOn April 23 it was said that for a year past the Emperor had allowed no\r\nopportunity of rousing the war spirit to pass. A week later a crusading\r\nsignificance was given to the approaching anniversary of Joan of Arc.\r\nIt was announced that more than twelve archbishops and bishops would\r\nattend--among them Cardinal Bonnechose--and that the Empress would\r\ngrace the scene. On May 1 the fact that the appearance in Paris of\r\nBenedetti, the French ambassador at Berlin, was officially said to have\r\nno connection with political prospects, was noted for a smile. On\r\nthe 13th the display at the festival of Joan of Arc at Orleans, with\r\na great array of prelates, was described as \"one of the noblest ever\r\nconnected with war and religion, well adapted to excite a nation which\r\naims at uniting the cross with the sword.\" On June 19 it was said that\r\nthe mission of General Fleury to Florence was with reason taken as a\r\nsign of approaching war.\r\n\r\nYet, while the Emperor of the French was looked to as leader against\r\nthe foe whom the Church had marked out for the first victim, every sign\r\nof discord in France, every outbreak or disorder was eagerly paraded\r\nas proof of the anarchy to which all countries must come under any\r\nrégime but that of the Church. At the same time every crime, riot, or\r\ndifficulty in Italy was magnified and dwelt upon with the same moral.\r\n\"Let the Chamber invoke the authority of the Council, and proclaim its\r\ncanons as the laws of the State,\" was the demand of the _Unitá_ eight\r\nmonths before the Council met (March 21). Another saying was, There are\r\nthree Italys--the Italy of Pius IX, which prays; the Italy of Mazzini,\r\nwhich conspires; the Italy of Menabrea, which trembles (March 27).\r\nMenabrea was then Premier. Again--\r\n\r\n    The Council is drawing near, and Babylon is trembling, hell is\r\n    blaspheming, and before long the world will hear the infallible\r\n    word of truth and righteousness. Hallelujah!... The revolution\r\n    which for nine years has been bent on marching to Rome is\r\n    disgraced, senseless, divided. The traitors are betrayed, the\r\n    robbers plundered, and the rebels plotted against by rebellion.\r\n    Hallelujah! (March 28).\r\n\r\nThe _Unitá_ found that the threefold opposition of governments,\r\nrationalists, and heretics showed itself most strongly in May, the\r\nmonth of Mary, which only means that the Immaculate has set her heel on\r\nthe three heads of the Hydra. Here the mention of governments as one\r\nhead of the Hydra is no slip of the pen, that is, governments which\r\ndwelt in Babylon, as we have just read, or in the tower of Babel, as\r\nit is more frequently expressed. Three days later (May 23) the _Unitá_\r\ncries, \"It is time for Catholics to be up in defence of the Council. It\r\nis the only plank of safety for shipwrecked society.\" The _Memoriale\r\nDiplomatique_ says that \"governments are less and less disposed to\r\ninterfere in religious questions, unless their rights are infringed;\r\nbut such reserve is war against the Council, which _being infallible\r\ncannot infringe any right_.\" The italics here are our own; and would\r\nthat we could print the words on the mind of every rising man in\r\nEngland. That would save vast waste of words.\r\n\r\nThe courage of the _Civiltá_ was stimulated by the French elections\r\nin the summer, and its hatred of United Italy boiled over. The ever\r\nfaithful _Univers_ had given the watchword to the electors. \"The\r\ntemporal power, and liberty of higher instruction!\" In the cry \"liberty\r\nof higher instruction,\" we have the popular side of the original\r\ncall of the _Civiltá_ for universities all over Europe, canonically\r\ninstituted. One hundred and twenty deputies were pledged to the\r\nprogram, and the French electors ought to be proclaimed as having\r\ndeserved well of Catholicism. \"The illustrious Louis Veuillot,\" as the\r\n_Civiltá_ styles him, had shown that what the Voltairians wanted was\r\nthe separation of Church and State, from which would follow the decay\r\nof Christian worship to such a point that it might be feasible to\r\nannihilate it.\r\n\r\nNoble, Catholic, chivalrous France is contrasted, by the _Civiltá_,\r\nwith vile Italy. The latter, in a serious catalogue of crimes, is said\r\nto have \"reduced the bishops to the extreme of poverty, has at its own\r\ncaprice impeded the divine word, and showed more than sixty dioceses\r\nwidowed of their pastors.\" The French voters had said, \"We go to the\r\nurn as the delegates of the universal suffrage of Christendom.\" \"The\r\nmonstrous edifice of Italian unity must crumble,\" says this Romanist,\r\nwho was no Roman. It is founded on the ruins of the temporal power of\r\nthe Pontiff, which cannot perish. (VII. vi. 611 ff.)\r\n\r\nThe plea of the Liberal Catholics for freedom of conscience became more\r\nand more offensive to the Catholics. The Fathers of Laach, in censuring\r\nthe address of the laymen of Coblentz, went so far as to say that the\r\ntreatment of the Jews in Rome \"showed no want of humanity or civil\r\ntolerance.\" These educated laymen well knew that the proper condition\r\nof heretics, according to the same principles, ought to be much worse\r\nthan that of the Ghetto Jews. The latter, not being baptized, were\r\ntheoretically not subject to the jurisdiction of the Church, but the\r\nothers, as Bellarmine shows, _though not of the Church, belonged to the\r\nChurch_. Stumpf, writing in the Bonn _Literaturblatt_, did not content\r\nhimself with questioning the intolerant doctrine of the Jesuits; he\r\ndirectly attacked it. He took an important step further--one, indeed,\r\nwhich seems like a new life in the Roman Catholic intellect. He told\r\nthe Jesuits plainly that their exclusive principle of one _fold_\r\nrendered religious freedom and unity impossible. Here he touched the\r\ndistinction between the grand and the huge, which Romanists carefully\r\nkeep out of sight, and which the sincerest advocates of liberty in\r\ntheir ranks had hitherto overlooked. They took for a grand conception\r\nof the unity of Christians, as consisting in submission to one human\r\nhead. That conception is narrow and illusory. It fails of grandeur by\r\nmonstrous disproportion. Stumpf goes on to declare that the absolute\r\ndominion of the Church over the State, although the favourite doctrine\r\nas he admits, in Rome, is in contradiction to the fundamental principle\r\nof Christianity. He would no longer be content, as a Liberal Catholic,\r\nto plead for freedom of conscience merely as a compromise. He says, We\r\nnow represent a principle. The theocratic principle menaces society,\r\nand that principle will never be satisfied till the acknowledgment of\r\ncivil rights is made to depend upon the profession of the Catholic\r\nfaith. He adds that a promise to compromise _till we had the power_\r\nwould content no one, because the modern world has learned that nothing\r\nis settled till the principle is settled. He says, We are determined to\r\nhave the Church a Church, and the State a State. But this a postulate\r\nwhich demands, as its condition, individual freedom. According to him\r\nit was Christ that introduced among men the idea of independence, and\r\nthat of a limit existing to the power of the State, by distinguishing\r\nHis own kingdom of love and grace from that of law and compulsion.\r\n\"When the Church authorities,\" says Stumpf, \"do admonish the rulers\r\nof the State, their first counsel should be to consider it their\r\nhighest duty to protect freedom of conscience. They ought to warn them,\r\nbefore any other kind of unrighteousness against the use of force,\r\nfor or against any form of religion which is not inconsistent with\r\nthe maintenance of moral law\"; and he adds, what we shall emphasize,\r\n\"_privation of civil equality is an employment of force_.\" Such, he\r\nsays, was the counsel given by the early Christian teachers; and though\r\nlater teachers reversed it, their course is not to be justified before\r\nthe law of Christ.\r\n\r\nThe _end_ of the State, as viewed by Stumpf, is much loftier than\r\nthat assigned to it in the Papal theory. In the great collection of\r\nfamilies called by men a State, he does not see a body politic without\r\na moral mission, existing, according to the ruinous theology of Rome,\r\nonly for temporal ends--a body politic which would be unworthy of God\r\nor man. According to Stumpf, the end of the State is _the maintenance\r\nof general moral order_. This theory does not bind the families of a\r\ncountry acting in their collective capacity, to prescribe the creed\r\nand cult of individuals. No more does it bind them, on the other hand,\r\nto resign all moral aims, leaving every moral question to be decided\r\nfor them without any appeal to the common conscience, to fruits or\r\nto the Bible, by a power which would strip the State of every moral\r\nquality, and would also prescribe the creed and cult of all. The\r\ntheory of Stumpf holds that the collective authority of the nation, in\r\nthe affairs common to all the families of that nation, is called to\r\nregulate action so far as action affects the common good, but does not\r\nhold that it is called to regulate belief. Claiming for the Church the\r\nfull right of asserting and urging moral principles, Stumpf, with great\r\nsolemnity, claims for the legislator freedom to frame law according to\r\nhis own conscience, and to his belief in what tends to the maintenance\r\nand the perfecting of moral order. This he has to do without the\r\ndirection of any ecclesiastic, but knowing that he must give account to\r\nGod. _No omnipotent word of Church authorities can or shall deter us\r\nfrom this work._ Then he interjects, Would it not be pleasant to have\r\nto consult the theologians of the _Civiltá_ and the _Stimmen_? The\r\nJesuits, he alleges, had no conception of any exercise of moral power\r\nupon one another but in the way of commanding and obeying. The Church\r\nin the middle ages, by her influence in secular affairs secularized\r\nherself, and lost her moral influence, which was never recovered\r\nto Christianity till the States had done what the Jesuits call\r\napostatizing from Christ, and so opened the way for a return of true\r\nmoral Christian influence. The early Church, he truly and nobly points\r\nout, was able, in the face of the omnipotent heathen authorities, to\r\npervade society with her true moral influences; and he contends that\r\nnothing can give back to the Church her position as the first force in\r\nculture, but the recognition of the independence of the State.\r\n\r\nOne very curious part of this grave and forceful essay is the protest\r\nof the layman against the twisting of Scripture by the Jesuits. He puts\r\ntogether a number of the texts upon which they ring the changes, making\r\nthem prove their own ideas by the simple process of putting those ideas\r\ninto them, and reiterating them again and again. The first of the texts\r\nwhich he quotes is, \"Teach all nations.\" He, apparently, is not aware\r\nthat this is now as handy a weapon with those theologians as \"obey God\r\nrather than man.\" In their lips \"teach\" means \"make laws,\" and \"all\r\nnations\" means, not _every creature_, but, collectively, all States.\r\nTherefore the words \"_teach all nations_\" are, in the lips of the\r\nJesuits, a commission to the Pope to give laws to all countries, or,\r\nin highflown language, \"to exercise the supreme magisterial office.\"\r\nThe Jesuits had saucily told the laymen of Coblentz to ask the nearest\r\ntheologian for an explanation of the relations between the natural\r\norder and the supernatural. But this particular layman gave them as\r\ngood as they brought. When men write as he does, they have begun to be\r\nCatholics, have ceased to be Papists, and are, however unconsciously,\r\nin process of ceasing to be Romanists.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Allocution of June 22, in which the constitution and new laws of\r\nAustria were condemned, had proved as distasteful to Liberal Catholics\r\nas it had been agreeable to the Jesuits. \"The Curialistic notion,\"\r\nsays the author of _Reform in Head and Members_, \"that the law of the\r\nChurch must be the inviolable rule for all laws and statutes, and\r\nfor all and every kind of activity in the life of the State, runs\r\nthrough it like a black thread. The Austrian _Magna Charta_ of civil,\r\npolitical, religious and scientific freedom was called a sacrilegious\r\nlaw. Moreover, the Pope,\" he proceeds to say, \"had declared that these\r\nlaws themselves, together with _all that should arise out of them_, are\r\nand ever will be invalid and of no effect.... Every enlightened person\r\namong the Catholics of Germany and France concealed himself in silence\r\nand in mourning at this rude opposition of Rome to the public law of\r\nthe entire Western world.\" Count Beust, in a despatch dated about ten\r\ndays after the Allocution was delivered, said that \"the Holy See had\r\nextended its animadversions to subjects 'which we by no means can allow\r\nto be under its authority.'\" We shall hereafter see how clearly and\r\ncompletely Count Beust had now grasped the question as between the\r\nPapacy and the life of nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 156: Monsignor Maret boldly quotes Eusebius as saying (Book\r\nII. cap. xiv.) that Peter was not only the greatest and strongest of\r\nthe Apostles, which is like what he says, but that he was the prince\r\nand patron of them all, which he does not say. That is said for him by\r\nthe Latin translator. The one word προἡγορον, \"spokesman,\" or\r\nchampion, of Eusebius is deliberately turned into the two, \"prince and\r\npatron\"--_Principem et patronum_.--_Maret_, vol. i. p. 97.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: See the original, _Vitelleschi_, p. 266.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: _Letter to the Duke of Norfolk_, p. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: _Friedberg_, p. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: See Lord Acton, _Zur Geschichte_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: _Weltbegebenheiten_, 336.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: Ibid. i. 327.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: Ibid. 340.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 164: _Civiltá_, VII. viii. pp. 209 ff.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nConflicting Manifestoes by Bishops--Attacks on\r\nBossuet--Darboy--Dupanloup combats Infallibility--His relations\r\nwith Dr. Pusey--Deschamps replies--Manning's Manifesto--Retort of\r\nFriedrich--Discordant Episcopal Witnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn November 1869 the Bishop of Versailles, writing of Bossuet, said\r\nthat the fame of the Eagle of Meaux was from day to day declining\r\n(_Friedberg_, p. 81). This was but a symptom of the new war against\r\nnationalism. Professor Ceccucci, though writing for a French audience,\r\ndid not scruple to say, \"If Bossuet escaped excommunication, he owed it\r\nto the benign and paternal indulgence of the Holy See\" (_Frond_, iv. p.\r\n112). Bishop Dupanloup soon took occasion to show that Innocent XI sent\r\nBossuet two briefs congratulating him on having written in a manner\r\ncalculated to win back heretics and increase the propagating power of\r\nthe Church.[165] If the Church, even before infallibility had been\r\nproclaimed, began to be so conscious of its narrowness that it could\r\nhardly contain Bossuet, what will it be when a few centuries more have\r\npassed over it?\r\n\r\nAs the opening of the Council drew nearer, feeling grew warmer in\r\npolitical and religious circles. Archbishop Darboy sketched the\r\nimpending dangers in a pastoral--\r\n\r\n    \"You have been told that articles of faith which hitherto you have\r\n    not been bound to believe, are to be imposed upon you; that points\r\n    affecting civil society and the relations of Church and State are\r\n    to be treated in a spirit opposed to the laws and usages of the\r\n    age; that a certain vote is to be carried by acclamation; that the\r\n    bishops will not be free, and that the minority, even if eloquent,\r\n    will be treated as an opposition, and will soon be put down by the\r\n    majority.... It must be owned that much has been done to spread\r\n    these alarms by writers taking different sides.\"[166]\r\n\r\nBishop Dupanloup, when about leaving home for the Council, published\r\na memorable letter. He seemed to regard the desire of the French\r\nclergy for centralization as the origin of the cry for a dogma. The\r\nchange, however, from a national to a Papal spirit was natural. Was it\r\nlikely that youths from the schools of the Christian Brothers, passed\r\nthrough an episcopal seminary, would comprehend the national spirit\r\nand episcopal convictions of Darboy or even of Dupanloup?[167] The\r\nlower education of the country had been just long enough in the hands\r\nof Rome to begin to bear fruit. Dupanloup meant no ill to France when\r\nhe succeeded in binding Louis Philippe to Gregory XVI, by inducing him\r\nto give the priests their way in schools, in return for forbearance in\r\nbaptizing the Comte de Paris, as the son of a mixed marriage, and of a\r\nmother who refused to abjure her Protestantism. But he then did one of\r\nthe most hurtful deeds to France, and to the future of European peace,\r\nthat man could have done.\r\n\r\n    This letter, cries Sambin, gave an episcopal head to the revolt;\r\n    ... the objection was pointed against the opportuneness of\r\n    defining the dogma of infallibility, but it was hardly possible\r\n    to be deceived--the principle of infallibility itself seemed to\r\n    be attacked.... The acts of the sovereign Pontiff were presented\r\n    in a light so far from the truth, that a feeling of profound\r\n    astonishment passed through the ranks of pastors and people. They\r\n    were grieved to see the paling away of the triple halo which had\r\n    hitherto hovered around the author's brow (_Sambin_, p. 49).\r\n\r\nThis was published in France in 1872, after Dupanloup had \"submitted,\"\r\nand rendered new and conspicuous service to the Papacy. As Dupanloup's\r\npamphlet will be hard to find hereafter, and as it is a representative\r\ndocument, we may give a general idea of the argument it presents.\r\n\r\nFor two years, says Dupanloup, thousands of printed papers have been\r\ncirculated in the streets, containing a vow to believe in the personal\r\ninfallibility of the Pope. Agents have got them signed by persons who\r\ndid not understand the first word of the question.\r\n\r\nHe contrasts the confidence and freedom of speech granted to the\r\n_Civiltá_ and the _Univers_ with the secrecy observed toward bishops.\r\nNaming Manning and Deschamps as the leaders in the agitation for the\r\nnew dogma, he adds, \"I say new, because for eighteen hundred years the\r\nfaithful have not, on pain of ceasing to be Catholics, been bound to\r\nbelieve it.\" Alluding to the freedom which, it was said, the bishops\r\nwould have in the Council, he asks what freedom was left to them even\r\nnow, when any who expressed an unwelcome opinion were denounced in the\r\npapers, beforehand, as schismatics or heretics.... \"After having taught\r\nfor eighteen hundred and seventy years, the Church is now to come and\r\nask in a Council, Who has the right of teaching with infallibility?...\r\nWhen the oak is twenty centuries old, digging to find the parent acorn\r\nunder the roots is the way to shake the tree.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bishop proceeds, with tact and great earnestness, to plead for\r\nthe necessity of moral unanimity in defining new dogmas. He relates a\r\nfact of interest, and one very closely affecting the person of Pius\r\nIX. We have seen that, in 1864, the Pope formally initiated official\r\npreparations for the Council; that he had long before 1867 decided\r\nimportant questions as to its constitution and procedure; that he had\r\nset commissions to work, consulted bishops in different countries, and\r\nordered nuncios to select theologians; and that it was only political\r\nperplexity which prevented the assembly of 1867 from being the General\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nYet Bishop Dupanloup, whether then aware of these facts or not, makes\r\nthe following statement--\r\n\r\n    I well remember, and more bishops than one who were present in\r\n    Rome in 1867 can recall, the fact that one of the most serious\r\n    anxieties of Pius IX, before deciding on holding the Vatican\r\n    Council, was, lest questions should arise calculated to provoke\r\n    stormy discussions, and divisions in the episcopate. But the Pope\r\n    remembered the sagacious conduct of the Council of Trent and of\r\n    Pius IV, and proceeded, in the hope that it would not be forgotten\r\n    at the future Council.\r\n\r\nOne of Dupanloup's solemn sayings is, \"I have read and read again the\r\ncatechism of the Council of Trent, on purpose to find if it spoke Yes\r\nor No about the infallibility of the Pope; I have ascertained that it\r\ndoes not say a word about it.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, he states that in 1867 one hundred and eighty-eight Anglican\r\nministers wrote to the Pope asking for the basis of a union. In\r\nhis reply, the Pope spoke of the authority of the Church and the\r\nsupremacy of the Pope, but he did not speak of his infallibility. Yet\r\njournalists, screening themselves behind his name, tried to shut the\r\nmouths of bishops by attacks full of violence and gall. This was meant\r\nfor M. Veuillot, who was not slow to reply.\r\n\r\nAs to Greeks and Protestants, Dupanloup points out that what is\r\nproposed amounts to telling them, \"A ditch now separates us; we are\r\ngoing to make it an abyss.... Two years ago. Dr. Pusey said to me in\r\nOrleans, 'There are eight thousand of us in England, daily praying for\r\na union.'\" ... When Pitt thought of relaxing laws against Catholics in\r\nEngland and Ireland, he asked several learned bodies what was the real\r\ndoctrine of the Roman Church on the power of the Pope. \"I have under my\r\neyes the replies of the Universities of Paris, Douay, Louvain, Alcala,\r\nSalamanca, and Valladolid.\" They all \"answer expressly that neither the\r\nPope nor the Cardinals, nor yet any body or individual in the Roman\r\nChurch, hold from Jesus Christ any civil authority over England, any\r\npower to release the subjects of his Britannic Majesty from their oath\r\nof fidelity.\" Such doctrine was calculated to reassure Pitt, as against\r\nthe contrary doctrine, professed in celebrated Bulls by more Popes than\r\none. But what if the Pope be declared infallible?\r\n\r\nAs to Catholic governments, their standing jealousy of the\r\necclesiastical power would be increased. Had not Boniface VIII\r\ntaught that the temporal sword also belonged to Peter, and that the\r\nspiritual power had a right to institute and judge the temporal? Had\r\nnot Paul III released all the subjects of Henry VIII from their oath\r\nof allegiance, offered England to any one who would conquer it, and\r\ngiven all the goods of the dissident English, real and personal, to the\r\nconqueror? Was not that Bull a great misfortune to Christendom? \"I am\r\nsad--and who would not be sad?--in recalling these great and painful\r\nhistorical facts; but they force us to it--those whose levity and\r\nrashness have stirred these burning questions.\" After the dogma shall\r\nhave been proclaimed, he contends that from the point of view occupied\r\nby governments, \"all civil and political rights, like all religious\r\nbelief, will be in the hand of a single man.\" The journals which claim\r\nto be purest in their Romanism \"treat the doctrine, so strongly held by\r\nthe Catholic sovereigns, as well as others, that each of the two powers\r\nis independent in its own sphere, as tainted with atheism.\"\r\n\r\nThe following passage in the Bishop's argument suffices to show that\r\nthere may be more senses of the statement that Catholics do not owe any\r\ndivided allegiance, than plain English folk ever dreamed of in their\r\nphilosophy--\r\n\r\n    We lately read, as quoted with praise in a French paper, the\r\n    following, which compares those to the Manicheans who deny that\r\n    the two swords are in the same hand: \"Are there two sources of\r\n    authority and power, two supreme ends for the members of the same\r\n    society, two different objects in the intention of the Being who\r\n    orders all and two distinct destinies in one and the same man, who\r\n    is both member of a Church and of a State? Who does not see the\r\n    absurdity of such a system? It is the dualism of the Manicheans if\r\n    not atheism.\"\r\n\r\nWe ought to interject the remark that \"the two swords in the same hand\"\r\nis not strict but popular language. The two are in the same _power_,\r\nbut only one is in the spiritual hand. Again, the taunt of Manicheism\r\nfrequently falls from Jesuit pens. Boniface VIII set the example of\r\ncalling people something like Manicheans, if they believed in any\r\nsupreme power in princes on a level with that of the Pope.\r\n\r\nComing to the crucial question, What is speaking _ex cathedrâ_?\r\nBishop Dupanloup shows that the diversity of doctrine on this point\r\nis almost endless, and perplexing beyond belief. The lay Professor of\r\nTheology in the seminary of the Archdiocese of Westminster, Dr. Ward,\r\nformerly an Anglican minister, goes beyond the great majority. They\r\nhold that a condition necessary to an infallible utterance is that the\r\nPope shall address the whole Church, but Dr. Ward thinks that this is\r\nnot necessary. The majority think that the intention of binding the\r\nbelief of the faithful must be clearly expressed, but Dr. Ward again\r\nthinks that it need not be so. Phillips, the German doctor, holds that\r\nthe Pope need not consult a Council, the Roman Church, the Cardinals,\r\nor any one; nor is it necessary that he should maturely deliberate\r\nor carefully study the matter by the light of God's written word and\r\nof tradition, or even that he should put up a prayer to God before\r\npronouncing sentence. \"Without any one of these conditions,\" says the\r\nBishop, \"his decision would not be less valid, authentic, or obligatory\r\non the whole Church, than if he had observed every condition dictated\r\nby faith, piety, and good sense.\" He adds the words of Phillips, that\r\nthe definition _ex cathedrâ_ may be verbal or written and with or\r\nwithout anathema, but must be given by him to all believing Christians\r\nas Vicar of Jesus Christ, in the name of the Apostles Peter and Paul,\r\nor in virtue of the authority of the Holy See, or in other similar\r\nterms. The Church, he says, according to Phillips, has no right to fix\r\nany condition or restriction whatever.\r\n\r\nCiting the cases of Popes Stephen VI, Honorius, and Pascal II,\r\nDupanloup shows that heavy facts obstruct the historical path to the\r\nnew dogma.\r\n\r\nHe proceeds to point out that the difference between the universal\r\ninfallibilists and the dogmatical infallibilists is very grave. The\r\nformer argue that the dogma, if adopted in the sense of the latter,\r\nwould involve a peril. A Pope infallible in some cases and fallible\r\nin others is, they think, a contradiction. If, as a private teacher,\r\nthe Pope should err in doctrine, might he not impose his error on the\r\nChurch? If this is not possible, you have either a Pope who thinks\r\none thing and defines another, or a perpetual miracle! And why\r\ndistinguish, ask the universal infallibilists, when Christ has not\r\ndistinguished? \"That thy faith fail not\"--that means the faith of Peter\r\nin every sense, personal and pastoral. These theologians contend that a\r\nPope could not, even if he would, fall into an error, public or private.\r\n\r\nAs to the effect of the change on the episcopate, Dupanloup contends\r\nthat Councils will be rendered superfluous. Hitherto, the bishops\r\nhave been judges of the faith, real judges, though in union with the\r\nPope--co-judges, as was said by Benedict XIV. But if the proposed\r\nchange is made, their judgment before or after will be of little\r\naccount; as Monsignor Manning has said, the Pope can determine \"without\r\nthe episcopate, and independently of it.\" The bishops, he proceeds,\r\nare now Doctors, not mere echoes. With the Pope they constitute the\r\nTeaching Church. After the change they will not be a voice, only an\r\necho.\r\n\r\nDrawing a glowing picture of the services of the French bishops to the\r\nPapacy, he says--\r\n\r\n    \"Ah! I dare to affirm that so much devotion to Rome and to the\r\n    Catholic world gives to the Church of France the right to be\r\n    trusted, to be heard.\" He adds, anticipating his arrival in Rome,\r\n    \"I shall no sooner touch the sacred ground, no sooner kiss the tomb\r\n    of the Apostles, than I shall feel myself in peace, out of the\r\n    battle, in the midst of an assembly presided over by a father and\r\n    composed of brethren. There the noises will all die away, the rash\r\n    interferences will cease, the indiscretions will disappear, the\r\n    winds and waves will be calmed down.\"\r\n\r\nThe statement, frequently repeated, that Bishop Dupanloup in this\r\nletter admitted the doctrine, and contested only the opportuneness of\r\ndefining it, is incorrect. This was pointed out at the time by Dr.\r\nReusch, of Bonn, in the _Literaturblatt_. Dupanloup once or twice\r\nsays that he will not touch the question of its truth, one way or the\r\nother. He never, directly or indirectly, indicates belief in it. Many\r\nof his arguments more than indirectly oppose the very substance of the\r\ndoctrine. He plainly feels that it is unscriptural, uncatholic, and\r\nunwise; but he knows that it is and has long been gospel in Rome.\r\n\r\nBishop Dupanloup was replied to by Archbishop Deschamps, of Malines.\r\nMonsignor Deschamps was following the straight path to the purple.\r\nHe roundly lectured Dupanloup. \"Why should not that trouble me which\r\nrejoices the enemies of the faith and of the Church?\" \"You have\r\ncommitted an error, Monsignor,\" he says, repeatedly. He correctly\r\nstates that Dupanloup has not confined himself to the question of\r\nopportuneness. \"You have handled the principal question, ... your\r\nfears have disturbed your vision.\"[168] Dupanloup prepared a rejoinder\r\nto Deschamps, but was prevented from publishing it by circumstances\r\nwhich taught him that in leaving France for Rome he had not passed\r\nfrom disturbance to tranquillity, but from regulated conflict to\r\nall-triumphant violence, compelling inaction, unless action was on\r\nits own side. In Rome, where any movement of an ecclesiastic is often\r\naccounted for by the prospect of some ribbon, robe, or perquisite, it\r\nwas freely said that Napoleon had promised Dupanloup the archbishopric\r\nof Lyons if he would head the Gallicans. An English paper repeated this\r\nRoman scandal, fathering it on well informed circles. Certain circles\r\nare always well informed as to the motives of men who oppose them.\r\n\r\nThe pastoral from the banks of the Thames forms a contrast to that\r\nfrom the banks of the Loire. True, Archbishop Manning no longer speaks\r\nof the extinction of Protestantism, or the restoration of the Pope's\r\ndominion over the East, as probable effects of the Council. He even\r\nshows some dawning consciousness that the war which he had announced\r\nin 1867 with a light heart, would not be carried through so lightly.\r\nIn the earlier part of his treatise he more than once coolly speaks of\r\nthe bishops as being unanimous in the belief of Papal infallibility!\r\nBefore the conclusion, Bishop Maret's work extorts the admission that\r\nhe must now call that doctrine Ultramontane, which two years before, he\r\nhad asserted to be Catholic. He none the less eagerly presses for the\r\ncarrying out of the programme. The Church is far too large. She permits\r\ndifferences of belief, which are not only unseemly, but dangerous.\r\nAfter an outbreak of questioning thought and conflicting will, such as\r\nhad been occasioned by a simple demand for only one or two new dogmas,\r\ntighter and tighter binding up seems to Dr. Manning to be not merely\r\nbecoming, but even necessary.\r\n\r\nWhile panting for additional fetters for his own Church, he speaks\r\nof Protestants as sighing for something beyond insular narrowness.\r\nIn fact, it would seem as if he had no perception of the difference\r\nbetween a big sect and a large creed, or of the possible harmony\r\nbetween a local organization and a universal brotherhood. There is\r\nno insular narrowness, much less Pontine-Marsh narrowness, in the\r\ndefinition of a Church given by the English Church, whereby she\r\nmarks her relation to all other Churches. That definition is large,\r\ncatholic, and scriptural. It leaves the English Churchman free from\r\nany obligation to unchurch other Christians, and therefore he may rest\r\nand be thankful, when others feel bound, by the narrowness of their\r\nsect, to unchurch him. The Church of Christ was catholic when she could\r\nnumber only one hundred and thirty adherents in the whole world. She\r\nwill never become more catholic than she was then. No sect can increase\r\nits catholicity by adding millions of ignorant and bigoted people, and\r\ncalling them Christians.\r\n\r\nDr. Manning resented, as a sort of rebellion, objections taken\r\nagainst multiplying terms of membership, and adding new conditions of\r\nsalvation. To him every increase of narrowness seemed an increase of\r\nunity. If there are men in the English Church sighing in a similar way\r\nfor bonds and anathemas which, thank God! our island does not forge,\r\nthey are not the men inspired by the catholic creed of their own\r\nChurch, but men infected by the municipal creed of the Popes.\r\n\r\nLike Dupanloup, Archbishop Manning made an attack and provoked a\r\nretort. He denounced the historical school of theologians in Germany,\r\nand especially in Munich, and was pitilessly cut up by Friedrich,\r\nin the _Literaturblatt_. The Archbishop, like Auguste Comte, had\r\nreached a point in the development of theory when it was necessary\r\nthat it should conquer history. Preparatory to the attack on the\r\nCatholic Faculty of Munich, he writes in mother English matter like\r\nthe following (p. 10): \"_The day is past for appeals to antiquity._\r\nIf Christianity and the Christian Scriptures are to be maintained in\r\ncontroversy against sceptical criticism, the unbroken, world-wide\r\nwitness of the Catholic Church must be invoked.\"\r\n\r\nA number of equally exposed positions are taken up in face of the\r\nLiberal Catholic scholars, and that with all the contempt which\r\nofficial power often feels for reasoning power--\r\n\r\n    \"They who, under the pretensions of historical criticism, deny the\r\n    witness of the Catholic Church to be the _maximum_ of evidence,\r\n    even in a historical sense, likewise ruin the foundation of\r\n    moral certainty in respect to Christianity altogether\" (p. 125).\r\n    \"No historical certainty can be called science except only by\r\n    courtesy. It is time that the pretensions of 'historical science'\r\n    and 'scientific historians' be reduced to their proper sphere\r\n    and limits. And this the Council will do, not by contention or\r\n    anathema, but by the words 'It hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost\r\n    and to us'\" (_id._).\r\n\r\nHowever confused in his ideas of catholicity and of historical\r\nauthority the Archbishop had become, the struggle he had done something\r\nto occasion and to exasperate already began to awake him to the\r\ndifference between an ordinary addition to the creed and that change of\r\nbase which he was moving heaven and earth to procure--\r\n\r\n    There is a difference, also, between a definition of the\r\n    infallibility of the Pope and that of any other Christian doctrine.\r\n    In the latter case the authority of the Church may be sufficient to\r\n    overcome any doubt. In the former _it is this very authority, the\r\n    principle and foundation of all certainty in faith_, which is in\r\n    question (p. 31).\r\n\r\nThese portentous words tell where Dr. Manning had placed himself--in\r\npupilage to a power which, having left the divine \"fountain of all\r\ncertainty in faith,\" was disputing as to what cistern, of all the\r\ncisterns it had hewn out, was the one into which the true spring\r\noverflowed. Where will the dogma be found to conquer the history made\r\nby the Archbishop's own hand when he wrote those words--history proving\r\nthat after he had been for years flourishing before Anglicans his Papal\r\nSociety as affording absolute certainty in faith, he himself declared\r\nher to be in the throes of a combat as to \"the principle and fountain\r\nof all certainty in faith\"? Where will a dogma be found to conquer\r\nthe history made at the moment when his Papal Society, in accordance\r\nwith his wishes, adopted an unchangeable decree, which, _if true_,\r\nproves that for all the time of her existence, she had not only been\r\nfallible, but had indeed failed, and that right grievously--failed as\r\nto the doctrine of her head, by withholding from him the recognition\r\nof his attributes and rights? If from the beginning the Popes were\r\ninfallible, the Church, which never consented to recognize them as such\r\ntill 1870, had up to that year failed in the doctrine of her head, and\r\nfailed in opposition to her head. If they were not from the beginning\r\ninfallible, she in 1870 failed in the doctrine of her head, and failed\r\nin conjunction with her head. The decree of 1870 fixes her in the fork,\r\nand out of it she cannot wrestle: if the decree was true she had been\r\nin a fault of faith up to that day; if it was not true, she committed\r\nthat day a fault in faith.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Manning did not fail to hold out once more a warning to the\r\ngovernments. For some months past the tone of the Vatican Press had\r\nbeen that of men who felt that they now held the internal peace of many\r\na nation at their mercy; being able to menace almost any government\r\nwith serious unrest, and some with overthrow. The habit of insinuating\r\nsuch threats seems to be native to the bad air which Dr. Newman truly\r\nspeaks of as hanging around the foot of the Pope's rock.[169] But the\r\nfollowing is too close a copy of those revolutionary vaticinations for\r\nthe banks of the Thames--\r\n\r\n    The Catholic Church now stands alone, as in the beginning, in its\r\n    divine isolation and power. \"Be wise now therefore, O ye kings; be\r\n    instructed, ye judges of the earth.\" There is an abyss before you,\r\n    into which thrones, and rights, and laws, and liberties may sink\r\n    together. You have to choose between the Revolution and the Church\r\n    of God. As you choose, so will your lot be. The General Council\r\n    gives to the world one more witness for the truths, laws, and\r\n    sanctities which include all that is pure, noble, just, venerable\r\n    upon earth. It will be an evil day for any State in Europe if it\r\n    engage in conflict with the Church of God. No weapon formed against\r\n    it ever yet has prospered (p. 130).\r\n\r\nThe last words might be enough to account for Cardinal Manning's\r\ndislike of history. They flatly contradict it, and it flatly\r\ncontradicts them; for by the Church of God is here meant the Church\r\nof the Pope. The weapons which have most prospered from the days of\r\nthe Reformation to this day are those that have been turned against\r\nthe Pope. The nations that have most prospered have been those that\r\nhave declared him a pretender; and in these nations the reigns that\r\nhave been distinguished for prosperity have been the most decidedly\r\nProtestant. England was long ago put to the choice between the\r\nReformation and the Church of the Pope, and happily chose the good\r\npart, and as she chose, so, ever blessed be the God of nations, has\r\nbeen our lot. We will repeat the choice of our fathers, and the lot\r\nof our children shall be better and better. And they will have to\r\npity, even more than we are called to pity, those who, having rejected\r\nreformation, have placed themselves under a continual terror and a\r\nliability to a periodical outburst of revolution.\r\n\r\nFriedrich, in the _Literaturblatt_ (v. p. 164), replied to the attack\r\non the historical theologians of Munich. He said that the abuses of\r\nthe middle ages had crept in through the total neglect of history. On\r\nthe other hand, Protestant theology had risen up and had matured as a\r\nstrictly historical theology. Baronius had attempted to win this weapon\r\nback to the service of Rome, and the Munich scholars had followed in\r\nhis steps. If archives and original works were to be wrested out of\r\ntheir hands, it meant nothing more nor less than laying down their arms\r\nin the presence of their antagonists. Friedrich would not allow the\r\nambiguous expression \"the witness of the Church\" to cover anything more\r\nthan her infallible utterances.\r\n\r\nHe said that the Archbishop had a false idea of the way in which a\r\nCouncil should proceed, because he seemed to think that the Church\r\nmight speak without first using all human means to ascertain the\r\ntruth. If he thought so, he was under a delusion of which a careful\r\nstudy of the history of the Councils might cure him. The statement of\r\nManning, \"I have already said,\" that the proofs of Papal infallibility\r\noutweighed those of the infallibility of the Church without the\r\nPope, provoked the remark that as the Archbishop had adduced only\r\nhis own authority, \"I have already said,\" we might still doubt the\r\ninfallibility of the proofs until he had produced his credentials as\r\none inspired. Friedrich says that while blaming others for attempting\r\nto influence the Council, Manning himself tried to impose his authority\r\nupon it, in such a manner that it might be fancied that the Council was\r\nnot to utter the words of the Holy Ghost, but those of the Archbishop\r\nof Westminster. Thus he indignantly flings back in the face of the\r\nprelate the assertion that it was an attempt to interfere with the\r\nfreedom of the Council when the Theological Faculty of Munich gave an\r\nopinion to the king of the country in answer to questions put by him.\r\nThe Archbishop, he protests, has no title to deprive theologians of\r\ntheir calling, or of their right to investigate historical evidences or\r\nto give their views, so long as the Church has not spoken.\r\n\r\nHe reminds the Archbishop that, severe as he is against those who do\r\nnot go as far as himself, even he does not go far enough, for his\r\nallies now begin to require people to say, that the Church may define\r\ndogmas without having any support in the Bible and tradition, and that\r\nindeed when nothing but apocryphal documents are in favour of the\r\ndefinition. And, moreover, that the authority of a General Council (as\r\ndistinguished from that of the Pope) is only human authority. These\r\ninnovations, says the sturdy German, we abhor; and then he leaves the\r\nEnglishman to the care of his Jesuit allies with these words: \"If what\r\neverybody here says\" (he writes in Rome) \"is true, that the Archbishop,\r\nat every opportunity, declares we have only one school to fear, the\r\nhistorical school, I grant to him and grant to his allies that they\r\nhave the light of history to fear.\"\r\n\r\nWith various feelings the bishops now set forth to bear witness as to\r\nthe faith of their respective Churches. This was the most dignified\r\nof the professed duties of a bishop in Councils as they used to be.\r\nIt had some show of a foundation so long as the rule of \"apostolic\"\r\ntradition was adhered to. Of course, however, that became antiquated.\r\nSo \"ecclesiastical\" tradition was set up side by side with apostolic,\r\nas what was so called had been set up side by side with the Word of God.\r\n\r\nDarboy set out, from his diocese of two millions of souls, to bear\r\nwitness that the doctrine of Papal infallibility was not the faith,\r\nand never had been, on the banks of the Seine. Manning set out to\r\ntestify that it was the faith and the tradition on the banks of the\r\nThames. Clifford set out from Clifton to declare that it was not the\r\nfaith on the Avon. Deschamps went to prove that it was the faith in\r\nMalines. Dupanloup went to prove that it was not, and never had been,\r\nthe faith in Orleans. Cullen left Dublin to demonstrate that it was,\r\nand ever had been, the true faith of Ireland. MacHale left Connaught,\r\nbracing up his fourscore years, to go and bear witness that it was\r\nnot the faith he had learned, no, nor any of his coevals. Spalding\r\nembarked from Baltimore to testify that it was the ancient faith in\r\nAmerica. Kenrick set forth from St. Louis to protest that this was the\r\nreverse of the truth, and to prove that he had never been taught it\r\nin Maynooth, and even to tell of the first time when the doctrine was\r\nbroached within the walls of that college. Rauscher left Vienna and\r\nSchwarzenberg Prague; Haynald left Hungary and Strossmayer Croatia; Von\r\nScherr left Munich, Melchers Cologne, and Förster Breslau, to testify\r\nthat the faith and tradition of their Churches had not ignored, but had\r\nwithstood, the new doctrine. They had to add that the conscience of the\r\npeople was so set against it that it was as much as the authority of\r\nthe Church was worth to attempt to impose it upon them. Von Ketteler\r\nleft Mainz to testify loudly, but with so uncertain a sound that no\r\nordinary man could \"know what was piped or harped.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the bishops of Spain, Italy, and South America\r\nalmost unanimously sallied forth to testify that in their Churches the\r\nnew dogma was an old doctrine.\r\n\r\nTheir testimony was reinforced by some from more ancient sees. Hassun\r\nset out from New Rome, as the Orientals call Constantinople, to bear\r\nwitness, as Patriarch of Cilicia, that the City of Paul, and the\r\nChurches planted by him, had always held the faith and tradition of\r\nPapal infallibility. Valerga turned his back on the Mount of Olives, on\r\nSion, and on Bethlehem, to give evidence, in the sight of God and man,\r\nthat the Church of Jerusalem had always held the faith, and conserved\r\nthe tradition, that the Roman Pontiff was infallible and his decrees\r\nirreformable.\r\n\r\nDarboy, in his farewell pastoral, said to the Catholics of Paris, \"In\r\nthese matters, bishops are witnesses who prove, not authors who invent.\"\r\n\r\nHad the contest lain between these two forces, the weight of talent,\r\ncharacter, and supporting Churches would have decided it in favour of\r\nthe _status quo_. But bishops sailed from Jaffna in Ceylon, and Jaro\r\nin the Philippines, from India, China, and Siam, from Swan River and\r\nNew Caledonia, to swamp with their traditions those of Bishops from\r\nChurches which might pretend to have a tradition. The fact that theirs\r\ncould not set up any such claim was one objection urged against their\r\nvotes, another being that they were dependent on the Propaganda. With\r\nthese came also a number of Oriental bishops, in the same financial\r\nposition, of whom Vitelleschi says that they brought the finest\r\nwardrobes and the steadiest votes. In aid of these a thick growth of\r\nbishops _in partibus_ sprang out of the well-warmed conserves of Court\r\npatronage.\r\n\r\nRoughly stated, the result was, that out of Italy and Spain old and\r\neducated Churches, when represented by prelates trained in their own\r\nbosom, generally declared in opposition to the new dogma. Where they\r\ndid otherwise, they were often represented by prelates trained _in\r\nRome_, and, like Cullen and Manning, specially selected to imbue the\r\nNational Church with the municipal theology of Rome, and, in case\r\nof need, to impose it upon the clergy. Those from really ancient\r\ncities, like Jerusalem, who supported the Curia, were dependents of\r\nthe Propaganda. With these came the occupants of sees created by Pius\r\nIX, most of which, from Westminster to Oceania, were represented by\r\nwitnesses in favour of infallibility.\r\n\r\nMany of the bishops had for travelling companion a small pamphlet. It\r\nwas called _Considerations_ (_Erwägungen?_), and put the case against\r\nPapal infallibility in a form and compass seldom equalled, in any\r\ncomposition, for clearness, depth, fulness, and compression. It was no\r\nsecret that the author was Döllinger, but he had not chosen to put his\r\nname on the title.\r\n\r\nIn this manner was prepared for the world a drama of many scenes, which\r\nhas left permanently in the eye of history four great spectacles--(1)\r\nHow an ancient aristocracy, claiming to be the senate of humanity, was\r\nmade the instrument of destroying its own legislative rights; (2) How\r\nmasters of ceremony, habituated to employ it for both political and\r\nreligious ends, were made its victims, ceremony being brought into\r\noperation to carry away surreptitiously their constitutional forms,\r\nand with them their legal privileges; (3) How they who had declared\r\n\"ecclesiastical\" tradition to be as good a foundation for doctrine as\r\nthe Word of God, went through the process of building on the sand; (4)\r\nHow a Head of the human species, a King of kings and Lord of lords, was\r\nerected by priests, and humiliated by Providence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 165: Letter as printed in _Otto Mesi_, p. 413, and now (but\r\nalso in French) in _Eight Months at Rome_, p. 277.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 166: _Friedberg_, p. 287.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 167: The author of _Reform in Head and Members_ says (p.\r\n156): \"The theological lecture-rooms of the Sorbonne are empty, and\r\nthe fame and splendour of France in theological science, in which\r\nshe once took so high a place, have been extinguished, since the\r\nclergy began to receive their education--that is, as much education\r\nas was indispensable--in the smaller episcopal seminaries, and their\r\ntheological training in the greater ones. There is no theological\r\nscience at all in France now.\" He supports this broad assertion by\r\ndetails given by Bouix, a well-known Ultramontane writer.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: _Stimmen_, _N.F._, vi. p. 57.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: _Letter to the Duke of Norfolk._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nDiplomatic Feeling and Fencing in Rome, November 1869--Cross\r\nPolicies on Separation of Church and State--Ollivier, Favre, De\r\nBanneville--Doctrines of French Statesmen ridiculed at Rome--Specimens\r\nof the Utterances approved at Court--Forecasts of War between\r\nFrance and Prussia--Growing Strength of the Movement in France for\r\nUniversities Canonically Instituted.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who arrived in the autumn months in Rome, perhaps with the hope\r\nof preventing the dreaded proposals from being brought forward, or with\r\nthe intention, if they could not succeed in that, of organizing an\r\nopposition to them, found to their surprise that the tone of the Curia\r\nwas very gentle. The Cardinals and Monsignori, for their part, really\r\ndid not care about infallibility. Indeed, the subject might have been\r\npassed over in silence had not such false rumours as to the designs of\r\nRome been set afloat. Lord Acton names Cardinals Antonelli, Berardi,\r\nand De Luca, and also Bishop Fessler, the Secretary of the Council,\r\nas declaring that the utterances of the _Civiltá_ were not to be\r\nrelied upon, and that if the idea of proposing infallibility had been\r\nentertained, it was given up. He also quotes a letter written home by\r\na bishop, afterwards known among the Opposition, saying that there was\r\nno ground for the idea that in Rome they meant to make infallibility\r\na dogma. That seemed to be an imagination, spread abroad with no good\r\ndesign. Still, after the agitation which had taken place the Council\r\ncould hardly pass the matter over in silence. The Holy See would not\r\ncurb the zeal of the bishops if they resolved to give effect to their\r\npersuasion, but would not itself take the initiative. But if anything\r\nwas done, it would be some moderate measure, that would satisfy all,\r\nand give no pretext of a party triumph.\r\n\r\nLord Acton further says, what is confirmed from many quarters, that\r\nCardinal Antonelli feared that the Pope was about to bring upon himself\r\ndifficulties similar to those which beset the earlier years of his\r\npontificate. Some treat Antonelli's apparent coldness as a _ruse_.\r\nBut, Englishman-like, Lord Acton takes the hypothesis that requires\r\nleast dissimulation, crediting the foresight of Antonelli with real\r\napprehensions.\r\n\r\nLord Acton expresses a belief that there might have been some idea of\r\nfinding a substitute for infallibility in the suppression of freedom\r\nof faith and conscience; with the expectation that the most prominent\r\nhindrance to the new dogma would be removed so soon as the Inquisition\r\nshould be recognized as having one and the same legal position with\r\nCatholicism itself. He thinks that a great step in that direction\r\nwould have been taken if the proposition of the Syllabus had been\r\nconfirmed which condemns the assertion that the Pontiffs and Councils\r\nhad ever transgressed the bounds of their power, or usurped the rights\r\nof princes. As to usurping the rights of princes, a writer like Lord\r\nActon is at a disadvantage, compared with one like Professor Ceccucci,\r\nwho wrote the history of General Councils, for the voluminous work of\r\nFrond. Ceccucci settles the point with an ease of which Lord Acton has\r\nno idea. The Church \"never did usurp political power; that possessed by\r\nher has always been the most legitimate on earth\" (_Frond_, vol. iv. p.\r\n358).\r\n\r\nBut one point stated by Lord Acton is that infallibility had been\r\nlooked upon as a means to an end; and this is the kernel of the matter.\r\nJust as, logically, the doctrine of infallible judgment was developed\r\nout of that of unlimited power, so, practically, unlimited power must\r\nbe exercised by an infallible judge. Admit that God has given all power\r\nupon earth to one man, and surely you will not deny that, in mercy to\r\nHis creatures, He will make that man infallible. Admit, on the other\r\nhand, that the judgment which bids the secular arm smite this and\r\nshield that is infallible, and surely you will own that the secular arm\r\nshould obey. Liberal Catholics were, not unnaturally, incensed at the\r\nwriting in the _Civiltá_ at a moment when those in power might have\r\nbeen expected to set an example of moderation. The Freemasons were told\r\nthat the reason why they dreaded the Council was that they would be\r\ncondemned, and that no respectable persons would join them after that.\r\nAnd the Liberal Catholics were told that their reasons for dreading\r\nthe Council were much the same. They professed similar principles with\r\nthose of the Masons, which were sometimes called Principles of '89,\r\nsometimes Principles of Modern Society, or Toleration, or Liberty of\r\nConscience and the Press, or Modern Constitutions, or the Rights of\r\nScience, or the Boons of Progress, or Liberalism. No wonder that men\r\nwho had championed the Church of Rome as the Catholic Church, should\r\ntremble when they saw her sinking into a sect so strait as to put all\r\nthese principles under ban (_Civiltá_, VII. viii. p. 285).\r\n\r\nOn November 9 the Pope received the Marquis of Banneville, newly\r\nreturned to his post as ambassador of France. After many signs of\r\nvacillation, the Emperor had finally decided not to ask for the\r\nadmission of an ambassador. This policy met the views both of the\r\nPapal party and of those who desired the entire separation of the\r\nChurch and the State. The latter had adopted the notion that they\r\ntook a step towards separation by leaving the Church, while still an\r\nestablishment of the State, to legislate for the nation over the head\r\nof the State. As early as July 10, 1868, M. Emile Ollivier, in the\r\n_Corps Législatif_, dwelling on the fact that the Pope, in his Bull,\r\ndid not name the Emperor, and that he held all those addressed in it\r\nbound by it simply through its being posted up in Rome, said: It is\r\ndeclared that, by the simple fact of its being issued in Rome, every\r\nbishop in France is bound and must betake himself to Rome, on pain of\r\ndisobedience. The Emperor or the civil power is not thought of. It is\r\nthe gravest act accomplished since 1789. It is the separation of Church\r\nand State, proclaimed, for the fist time, by the Pope himself.\r\n\r\nOn April 9, 1869, Ollivier again raised the subject, protesting\r\nthat the abstention of the government from the Council amounted to\r\nan abrogation of the organic articles of the Concordat. Jules Favre\r\nsaid that it was the separation of Church and State, and as such he\r\ngratefully accepted it. These consequences were denied by the minister,\r\nM. Baroche, who asserted, \"After the Council, the rights of France will\r\nremain entire.\"\r\n\r\nThis boast passed in France, but not so at the Vatican. The _Unitá\r\nCattolica_ for April 14 showed that the usual ambiguity of the\r\nBonaparte policy marked the replies of the ministers on this critical\r\noccasion. The bishops were to go to the Council with \"their conscience\r\nin full liberty,\" and yet \"after the Council the rights of France\r\nwere to remain entire.\" \"What,\" asks the _Unitá_, \"does that mean?\r\nDoes France want to be free either to relieve or to oppose what the\r\nCouncil will define? After having permitted her bishops to take part in\r\nan assembly which every Catholic must believe to be infallible, does\r\nNapoleon III mean to hold himself free to prosecute them if they preach\r\nthe doctrines defined, and enforce the discipline enjoined by the\r\nCouncil?\"\r\n\r\nThis straightforward question shows that M. Picard hit nearer to the\r\npoint than either Ollivier or Favre; for he cried, \"It means a Church\r\nfree in a State not free.\"[170] Even that is not quite the truth; which\r\nstrictly is, A State not free in a Church which is free; for the State\r\nis part, and the Church whole; or, to recall the image from the early\r\npages of the _Civiltá_, the State is the leg and the Church the man.\r\nWe have seen it roundly asserted by the _Civiltá_ that the Church free\r\nmeans canon law free. That being so, for any man to speak of the State\r\nbeing free, in any modern sense, is trifling. In its expositions of\r\nthe Syllabus the _Civiltá_ had laid down the true doctrine as follows:\r\n_The first condition of an efficient alliance of the laws of the State\r\nwith the laws of the Church, is the application in every case wherein\r\nspiritual penalties are insufficient of the means of coercion whereof\r\nthe State disposes._ The voice of the pastor has not always efficacy\r\nsufficient to drive away the rapacious wolves from the fold of Christ.\r\nTherefore does it appertain to the prince invested with the authority\r\nof the sword to arm himself with its force, in order to repel and put\r\nto flight all the enemies of the Church (VI. ii. 137). Refusing to\r\nstand in this position is, in the esoteric sense, separating the State\r\nfrom the Church. To a conscientious Ultramontane it is absurd to say\r\nthat a State in this manner subject to the Church is not free, as it\r\nwould be to say that a body ruled by its informing mind is not free.\r\nThat is the figure of speech which recurs at every turn of discourse on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nAfter it had been determined to ratify the policy censured by Picard,\r\nDe Banneville had his interview. Most writers describe him as a willing\r\ntool of the Curia, and as doing all he could to lead France in the way\r\nwhich it might trace out for her. Lord Acton regards him as honestly\r\nhoping to compose a difference between the Italian and German schools\r\nof theology, by the moderating weight of French influence.[171]\r\nBanneville's despatch, on the occasion now in question, would rather\r\nseem to countenance the former opinion than the latter.[172] But the\r\nPope in the interview did not say a word indicating his personal\r\nopinion as to the questions to be decided. He did, however, say\r\nthat all must be left to the wisdom of the Fathers--as if all had\r\nnot been prepared, and doubly prepared. He further said that the\r\nrash conjectures of hasty spirits--in manifest allusion to the\r\n_Civiltá_--were to be regretted, as also the premature discussion of\r\nquestions which would have been better reserved to the Council itself.\r\n\r\nIt is not probable that this deceived M. de Banneville as to the\r\npast, for he well knew how the Pope had encouraged the \"premature\r\ndiscussions\"; but he might take it as the covering of a retreat from a\r\nposition found to be too advanced. But a wary man might have felt that\r\nperhaps the retreat was only a feint.\r\n\r\nThe despatch of M. de Banneville shows that Pius IX, like every\r\nItalian, knows how to keep his own counsel. Even his renowned saying, I\r\nam tradition--_La tradizione son io_--is no more than what M. Veuillot\r\nhad said in proving that the Pope could not be an innovator--\"Peter can\r\nno more be an innovator than the Holy Spirit, which reveals tradition\r\nto him.\"[173]\r\n\r\nThe tranquillity of the Curia on this occasion was that of perfected\r\npreparation. The dissimulation would not provoke a remark from a\r\nRoman. The effect of both was to prevent the anti-infallibilists from\r\norganizing any opposition.\r\n\r\nSome examples of the points kept before readers arriving at the\r\nHoly City at this particular time may be of permanent interest. The\r\nCanadian Bishop of St. Hyacinthe was quoted as writing, \"Sublime\r\nassembly, in which the eye of faith contemplates with wonder, poor and\r\nsimple mortals who, sitting as judges, do not hesitate _to impose the\r\nresponsibility of their decisions and judgments on the Holy Spirit_,\r\nbecause they know and believe that they form together with Him one\r\ntribunal.\" The emphases are given as we find them.[174]\r\n\r\nA Latin pamphlet on the crisis, by a layman, was ridiculed, and one\r\npoint, which seemed most comical to the reviewer, was that the author\r\nproposed two such queer anathemas; first, if any one offends against\r\ncharity, let him be anathema; secondly, if any one begins war, let him\r\nbe anathema.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Lima, being ninety-four years of age, was unable to\r\ncome in person, but sent his pastoral staff as a present to the Pope.\r\nIt was of pure Peruvian gold, and of the value of two thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nFrom the thrice-blessed Republic of Ecuador came the Archbishop of\r\nQuito, presenting a chalice of gold, rich with precious pearls. He bore\r\nvaluable gifts in addition. That \"illustrious Catholic,\" the President,\r\nGarcia Moreno, had, on a public occasion, been presenting prizes to\r\nstudents, when they joyfully laid down their medals to send them as\r\nan offering to the Holy Father. On seeing this, the President took\r\nfrom his breast a medal of rare value, all studded with gems, which\r\nhad been presented to him by the government for distinguished services\r\nto the country. This he added to the tribute of the youths, and the\r\nArchbishop had the joy of laying the united oblation at the feet of the\r\nPontiff.[175]\r\n\r\nFrom Venezuela the Archbishop brought more than three thousand pounds\r\nin money. His people had also laden him with their valuables, ladies\r\nhaving taken off earrings, bracelets, necklaces, and rings to send, as\r\ntokens of their devotion to the impoverished Pope.\r\n\r\nHad our English journalists devoutly pondered the elaborate description\r\ngiven at this cheerful juncture of a bell designed by a priest, and\r\npresented for the use of the Presidents in the Council, they would not\r\nhave wasted so much criticism as they did on the rhetoric of a speech\r\nreported in the _Daily News_, in 1875, as having been made by the\r\nPope, censuring Mr. Gladstone. His Holiness spoke of that gentleman as\r\na viper attacking the bark of St. Peter, or something of that sort.\r\nNow the bell in question was described as being symbolic, within and\r\nwithout. The clapper of it was the ship of Peter, round the hull of\r\nwhich was coiled a serpent attempting to board the vessel, but it was\r\nfinally precipitated with its head down, and the three-forked tongue\r\nshooting out.\r\n\r\nThe doubt of our men of letters as to whether the Pope could use a\r\nmetaphor describing a snake attacking a bark, illustrates, in general,\r\nwhat Cardinal Manning said of those gentlemen on the particular\r\noccasion of the Council--\"When English Protestants undertake to write\r\nof an OEcumenical Council of the Catholic Church, nothing less than\r\na miracle can preserve them from making themselves ridiculous.\"[176]\r\nIt would require a miracle to prevent any one from making himself\r\nridiculous who should criticize the Speeches of Pius IX, assuming that\r\nhis metaphors must have been subject to some rule.[177]\r\n\r\nWe find the revolution called by the _Civiltá_ \"the executioner of the\r\nChurch\"; and it is said that the Pontiff in his distress is rendered\r\nmore and more like Christ upon the Cross, whom he represents, and with\r\nwhom he can repeat, \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\" (Id.\r\np. 514).\r\n\r\nThe Word of God is shown to be the source of human redemption, and then\r\nthe following applications are made of this principle--[178]\r\n\r\n    \"The State indeed must be civilized and modernized by separating it\r\n    from the living Word in the Church, that it may die.... The laws\r\n    must be civilized and modernized by putting them in opposition to\r\n    the laws of the Word, that they may be laws of death.... Some would\r\n    wish the Word to reconcile Himself with Satan.... Schools must be\r\n    civilized and modernized by separating them from the schools of the\r\n    Word, that they may be schools of death. Wedlock must be civilized\r\n    and modernized by separating it from the consecration of the\r\n    Word, that it may be the wedlock of death. Public speech must be\r\n    modernized and civilized by separating it from the influence of the\r\n    Word, that it may be the speech of death. Everything, in fine, must\r\n    perish, since everything must be secularized, or torn away from\r\n    that God who _upholdeth all things by the Word of His power_....\r\n    The modern revolution, inspired by Satan, would find that all its\r\n    weapons directed against the Vatican were destined to have no other\r\n    effect than that of multiplying the victories of the Word of God,\r\n    who reigns there in the humble person of His Vicar\" (pp. 522-26).\r\n\r\nThe Court, if we may judge by its organs, was deeply affected at the\r\nwant of faith displayed by many Catholics, who expressed fears lest the\r\nCouncil should define anything that it ought not to define. Did they\r\nnot know that the Holy Ghost would preserve it unerring? Why then all\r\nthis solicitude? Could they not trust a body so guided to go right,\r\nwithout their advices and warnings? They treated it \"as an ordinary\r\nhuman assembly.\" This sounded like mockery to those who had any idea of\r\nhow much Rome had done in employing _art and man's device_ to prevent\r\nthe Council from going wrong and to forestall all possible impulses in\r\nany direction not predetermined. Had they only known of the long labour\r\nand the jealous precautions which we shall see gradually coming to\r\nlight, the retorts they did make would have been much more indignant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 170: _Friedberg_, pp. 93, 94.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 171: _Zur Geschichte._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: _Friedberg_, p. 330.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 173: Vol. i. p. cxxi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: _Civiltá_, VII. viii. 335.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 175: Under Moreno, Ecuador attained the distinction of being\r\noften mentioned, with solemn commendation, as the one and the only\r\n_Catholic State_ in the world; the one in which the principles of the\r\nSyllabus were applied.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 176: _Priv.

The Roman nobles in many cases gave up\r\ntheir palaces to the Fathers of the Council. With his habitual personal\r\nliberality, the Pope freely offered hospitality to all who would accept\r\nit. This simple act, natural to his station, and still more to his\r\ndisposition, was smiled at as a good bid for votes. About three hundred\r\nbishops made themselves, in whole or in part, dependent for their daily\r\nexpenses on the bounty of the man upon whose exaltation they were to\r\ndecide. The _Civiltá_, as if to emphasize their dependence, told how\r\nthey were lodged, supported, and assisted by him in all the necessaries\r\nof life. Hence the mocking name of the \"Pope's boarders,\" which greeted\r\nany manifestations of opinion on their part. It is said that his\r\nexpenses for the entertainment of the bishops amounted to one hundred\r\npounds per day.\r\n\r\nA case of history repeating itself is suggested by these allegations\r\nas to the diplomatic value of the Pope's hospitality. Dr. Karl\r\nBenrath has restored to his place among Italian worthies one of the\r\nmost picturesque figures of the many-hued life of that nation in the\r\nsixteenth century. This was Frà Bernardino Ochino, the all-eloquent\r\nGeneral of the Capuchins, whom the blot of the Inquisition had covered\r\nfrom the common eye for three centuries. Ochino, who became a guest\r\nof Cranmer and a prebendary of Canterbury, wrote on the banks of\r\nthe Thames, among other works, one called _The Tragedy_. Conceiving\r\nof the Papacy exactly as all modern Italian Protestants do, as the\r\nanti-Christ, and the masterpiece of Satan, he traces the rise of this\r\ndread power. Besides supernatural sources of ascendancy, he alleges the\r\nfact that in early ages the Bishops of Rome entertained bishops out of\r\nthe provinces when they fled to the capital from persecution, or came\r\nfrom other causes, and thus the Roman prelates acquired great influence\r\nover the others. Their object then was \"Primacy,\" out of which\r\ninfallibility was in our day to come. Ochino puts into the mouth of the\r\nsecretary to the Emperor, after he has discovered the Pope's yearnings,\r\nthe following words: \"O Lord God, that there can be so much ambition in\r\nthe heart of a man! it is no marvel that he entertains in so friendly a\r\nmanner all strangers who come to Rome.\"\r\n\r\nBesides bishops came a mixed multitude--the devout Catholic, the\r\nkeen politician, the commonplace tourist from every country, the gay\r\nsightseer, the American politician, the artist, the charlatan, the\r\nIndian civilian on furlough, and the learned official theologian.\r\nFew, but intent, came a new class of spectators--Italian Protestants,\r\nwatching with eyes as open to all priestly arts as men of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, but with a readiness to affiliate each part of a Roman show\r\non its Pagan original, much beyond what was even then common among our\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nThe Count Henri de Riancey, beholding the hierarchy pressing to the\r\nsacred walls, exclaims--\r\n\r\n    Open then thy gates, metropolis of the world; open thine\r\n    everlasting gates, that the Queen of glory may come in! And who is\r\n    this Queen of glory? It is the Church.... Make way, then, for the\r\n    angels of the Churches, spoken of by St. John. Make way for the\r\n    divine hierarchy, the ranks of which are moving, with order, force,\r\n    and holiness, terrible as an army with banners (_Frond_, vol. i. p.\r\n    9).\r\n\r\nOne of the theologians has published a diary (_Tagebuch_), which\r\nwill always remain one of the original sources of information on the\r\nCouncil. Its accuracy, like that of the _Letters of Quirinus_, has been\r\nassailed, and with not dissimilar result. Strong general assertions\r\nand weak proof, except on such minor points as show that the substance\r\nis unassailable, leave its accuracy but slightly impeached, and its\r\ntruthfulness not at all discredited. The author states things which,\r\nby our standard, would be held private; but however that may be by the\r\nstandard of his own country, the things, when once published, take\r\ntheir place among the materials of history.\r\n\r\nDr. Friedrich, a professor of Munich, was appointed theologian for\r\nthe Council to Cardinal Hohenlohe. He began his diary before leaving\r\nhome. He found that it was vain to seek in the palace of Archbishop\r\nVon Scherr for such works in the original as a set of the Fathers,\r\nor a collection of the Acts of the Councils. The Reverend Secretary\r\nsaid, \"You know little of bishops if you think that those people study\r\nanything.\" This gentleman, who was to be the Archbishop's theologian\r\nat the Council, himself read only pamphlets. When Friedrich was on the\r\nrailway platform, observing the two Archbishops of Munich and Bamberg,\r\ntaking their departure for the Council, the confidential servant of the\r\nlatter came up to the Professor and said, \"You are not surely coming to\r\nRome as a spy?\" Answering not the man but the master, he replied: \"Let\r\nbishops take care that they do not betray the Church, for just as they\r\nare bound to speak to the best of their knowledge and conscience, so am\r\nI as a theologian.\"\r\n\r\nThus Friedrich evidently expected to have to speak, as it would seem\r\nthat Newman also did. He did not know how the secret plans had put\r\naside all such possibilities. But if surprises awaited him as to the\r\nnew part reserved for the doctors, there were surprises for the bishops\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nFriedrich remarked that, as he travelled farther south, less and less\r\nrespect was shown to the clergy, till in Italy the difference, as\r\ncompared with Germany, became painful. At Trent, a scholar warned him\r\nto beware of poison, and said that it was well that Döllinger had not\r\ngone to Rome, as he would never have returned.\r\n\r\nThe theologian, full of the lore of Munich, standing in the quaint\r\nAlpine city, on the Adige, with the image in his mind of the doctors\r\nwho, three hundred years ago, there disputed before the bishops and\r\nbefore the world, would naturally form an exalted idea of the work\r\nawaiting him in the grander assembly on the banks of the Tiber. The\r\nchurch of St. Maria Maggiore would swell, in his anticipation, into St.\r\nPeter's; the listening prelates to a threefold or fourfold array. The\r\nstruggle itself was to be much more concentrated, turning on one vital\r\npoint. It was not now merely a question as to what was to be taught,\r\nbut as to who was the divine teacher. It was not a dispute about one\r\ndoctrine or more, but about the very fountain of doctrine. It was not\r\nany question between the Church and her enemies, but one between the\r\nChurch and her head. It was to be decided whether the oracle was the\r\nwhole Church, or the Pope without the Church. The dispute was awkward.\r\nRaising it showed Protestants that Rome, while claiming infallibility,\r\nhad not yet settled where it lay.\r\n\r\nAfter a narrow escape of being murdered on the railway near Terni,\r\nFriedrich reached the Holy City. Such was the throng, already, that\r\nhe had to pay ten francs for the use of a room for a while in the\r\nafternoon, before going to his home in the Palazzo Valentini with\r\nCardinal Hohenlohe. That palace stands in the Piazza of the Twelve\r\nApostles, full of reminiscences of days when Alberich and his\r\ndescendants ruled the city, and held the Popes, sometimes in prison,\r\nbut always in subjection to the chiefs springing from Theodora and\r\nMarozia.\r\n\r\nOn November 28, a discourse was delivered in St. Peter's, by Father\r\nRaimondo Bianchi, Procurator-General of the Dominicans, which was\r\nthought sufficiently important to be printed with the Freiburg edition\r\nof the _Acta_ (p. 130). If good preaching lies in saying much and\r\nsuggesting more, in the least time, this sermon is perfection; for it\r\noccupies less than four octavo pages. A note which we have already\r\nheard delicately touched by Archbishop Manning, a note at that time\r\nas often sounded as any in the episcopal scale, was given forth with\r\nfull power: \"Be wise, O ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the\r\nearth.\"[179]\r\n\r\nOn December 4, the Dominicans appeared again. The Pope, departing from\r\nthe usual course, had appointed Father Jandel as their general; some\r\nsay selecting him that he might amend the theology of the order, the\r\nmembers of which were known to be weak Immaculatists, and suspected\r\nof not being sound Infallibilists. Father Jandel now broke out in a\r\ncircular, which twenty years ago we should have smiled at as at new\r\n_gri-gri_, but which now seems to be more like to the red cross of\r\nthe Muster. We shall presently see how scientifically Tarquini had\r\ndemonstrated that the right of _directly_ wielding the temporal sword\r\ndid, in spite of all denials, belong to the Pope and a General Council,\r\nand we have already seen with what fascination popular pens were\r\nsurrounding the life and death of the \"soldier of the Cross.\"\r\n\r\n\"We hasten,\" exclaims Jandel, \"to announce to you the joyful tidings,\r\nand we make speed to convey to you the pontifical brief which grants\r\nnew indulgences for the recitation of the rosary during the whole\r\ncontinuance of the Vatican Council.\" The brief thus heralded looks\r\nas if the inspiration of St. Peter Arbues, \"first inquisitor of the\r\nkingdom of Aragon,\" was beginning to operate. The Pontiff informs\r\nthe faithful that St. Dominic, armed with this rosary, as with an\r\ninvincible sword, crushed the infamous heresy of the Albigenses.\r\nTherefore, in the present crisis, equipped with the same armour, and\r\n_with the authority of the Vatican Council_, they will be enabled to\r\n\"overthrow and extirpate the manifold monsters of error that prowl\r\naround.\" To invite all to arm themselves with this holy weapon,\r\nspecial indulgences are granted to those who will daily recite ten\r\nrosaries, so long as the Council lasts. We believe a rosary consists\r\nof one Paternoster, ten Ave Marias, and one Gloria; so that each week\r\nseven hundred prayers to the Virgin, seventy to God, with seventy\r\ndoxologies, would have to be repeated. The Pope strongly expresses his\r\nsimple faith in the efficacy of this expedient.[180]\r\n\r\nAll who know what has been going on in Europe of late years know that\r\nthe time for smiling at rosaries is past. A charm or a _chupattie_\r\nceases to be a trifle when it becomes the symbol connecting devotion\r\nwith deeds of blood. At a time when millions upon millions of children\r\nare in the hands of those who, with gentle manners and profoundly\r\nconscientious views, instil antipathies which time can scarcely\r\nextract, charms become formidable when to such antipathies they are\r\nthe symbols of--as the _Civiltá_ puts it--a pure conscience, a sublime\r\ncause, and an immortal hope.\r\n\r\nThe significance of these demonstrations was greatest for those who\r\nhad watched the doctrines which were being elaborated by the Jesuits\r\nand diffused both through periodicals and such scholastic books as\r\nthat of Tarquini. The doctrine of Boniface VIII, that the material\r\nsword was not in the hand of the priest, but only at his beck, was\r\nbeing replaced by a higher one. Boniface accused those of Manichean\r\ndualism who did not confess that both swords were in his _power_. But\r\nit proved that he had himself leaned too much towards dualism, for he\r\ndenied the material sword to the priest's own hand. This doctrine would\r\nno longer do. Cardinal Tarquini, who, it must not be forgotten, is set\r\nbefore us by Cardinal Manning as the modern example of teaching milder\r\nthan that of Bellarmine and Suarez, goes beyond the theology of former\r\ntimes, and claims the _direct_ right of the sword, even in war, for the\r\n_hand of the Pope and a Council_, though still denying it to inferior\r\necclesiastical authorities.\r\n\r\n    I admit, says Tarquini (p. 39), that the Church is a spiritual\r\n    society as to its end; I deny that it is so as to its\r\n    substance--that is, as to the members composing it, since they are\r\n    not mere spirits but men. I admit that it ought to use spiritual\r\n    means--that is, means _which are adapted to the attainment_ of\r\n    the spiritual end. I deny that it should use only means which are\r\n    spiritual in themselves and in their nature. Every one who is not\r\n    a simpleton knows that men (in whom soul is joined with body) are\r\n    to be moved, corrected, and coerced; hence they cannot be led to\r\n    an end, even a spiritual one, by purely spiritual means. But the\r\n    matter, quality, and proportion of the means is to be determined by\r\n    the requirements of the end.\r\n\r\nAs to the words of our Lord, that His disciples shall not exercise\r\nlordship as the kings of the Gentiles do, he admits that they bind the\r\nChurch to shun dominion _so far as that means a spirit of ambition\r\nwhereby any one might subject others to himself for his own glory or\r\nadvantage_; but he denies that they require her to shun dominion in so\r\nfar as it means the office of ruling, and that of administering means\r\ncontributing to the attainment of her end.\r\n\r\nHe labours to meet the objection against the use of force by the\r\nChurch, drawn from her own doctrine, that men are to be called to her\r\nbosom freely and without compulsion. He asserts that liberty here means\r\nfreedom from _intrinsic necessity_, but not from _extrinsic necessity_,\r\nor coaction. This coaction or compulsion does not prevent either merit,\r\nor the attainment of the spiritual end; indeed, when applied by the\r\nChurch, greatly promotes them. He admits that compulsion is not to be\r\nused towards infidels--that is, unbaptized persons--but denies that it\r\nis not to be used towards baptized persons.\r\n\r\nAs to the objection founded on 2 Tim. iv. 2-5, that \"the weapons of the\r\nChurch are altogether confined to exhortations and tears,\" he simply\r\nsays, I deny it. Then he argues that the words of St. Paul in this\r\nplace rather weaken than support those who oppose the use of force;\r\nbecause the terms he employs are both _general and sharp: reprove,\r\nrebuke, be instant in season and out of season_. All means which\r\nnecessity may call for are included. He admits that longsuffering and\r\ndoctrine are to be employed, if necessity demands no harsher means;\r\nbut denies that they are to be employed exclusively. He demands that\r\nthe character of the times in which these texts were written shall\r\nnot be forgotten, namely, times in which the Church, being under the\r\nunfriendly government of the heathen, _was not able to put forth the\r\nfulness of her power_. But it cannot be proved by any arguments that\r\nthis right (_jus gladii_) may not be _immediately_ exercised by the\r\nsupreme magistracy of the Church, if necessity call for it; for the\r\ncontrary indeed may be demonstrated from natural law, since the Church\r\nis a Perfect Society; and no passage can be cited from positive divine\r\nlaw in which it is really prohibited, for Matthew xxvi. 52 is quite\r\ninapplicable, where Christ says to Peter, _then a private man_, \"Put up\r\nagain thy sword into its place\"; and 2 Cor. x. 4, where Paul, declaring\r\nthe might of his own power, says, \"_The weapons of our warfare are not\r\ncarnal_ (that is, are not fragile or futile), _but are mighty through\r\nGod to the pulling down of strongholds_.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that the meaning of carnal weapons is coolly assumed to be\r\nfragile or futile ones, is not to be overlooked. It would naturally\r\nfollow that the chassepots at Mentana, which were neither fragile\r\nnor futile, were not carnal weapons. Of course Tarquini would have\r\nsaid that though in their proper nature carnal, when serving a purely\r\nspiritual end they took on a spiritual character. But we cannot forget\r\nthat the \"strongholds\" which the weapons of Paul were mighty to\r\npull down were \"imaginations,\" and the captives they led bound were\r\n\"thoughts.\" That is a sphere in which the proper weapon is not either\r\nshot or fetter, but the word and the works of men whom God makes wise\r\nto teach and holy to charm. There is one symbol which the Vatican never\r\nsees, that of the true and only Head of the Church, with no sword in\r\nHis hand, much less two, but one sharp sword with two edges proceeding\r\n_out of His mouth_. That alone is the weapon that is not carnal but\r\nmighty through God.\r\n\r\nWe now begin to see the grounds cropping out on which Mr. Bryce's\r\ndoctrine of two heads to the Catholic State, one civil and one\r\nspiritual, was condemned. The days of dualism and Manicheism in any\r\nform were numbered.\r\n\r\nWith their complaints that the Jesuits, both in the confessionals and\r\nin their text-books, corrupted Catholic morality, the Liberal Catholics\r\nmingled loud and bitter complaints that they sought to make the people\r\nsuperstitious and to keep them ignorant. It was often alleged that\r\neven their schools, or those under their virtual if not ostensible\r\ncontrol, were themselves preserves of ignorance and superstition,\r\nkeeping the scholars from an education, according to their capacity,\r\nfor one \"suited to their position,\" and at the same time preparing\r\nthem to receive all kinds of fables and \"lying wonders,\"--a term not\r\ninfrequently quoted by Liberal Catholics. Those fables and wonders\r\nwould open a field so large, and one lying on a level so low, that\r\nwe have not cared even to glance at them. As found in local clerical\r\npapers, or books of what is called \"devotions,\" they are so gross that\r\na writer could hardly repeat them without incurring loss, not only in\r\nthe respect of others, but in self-respect. Liberal Catholics, however,\r\nknow that they are a real power in Jesuit hands, one of the powers in\r\nthe future war against science, the Press, and free government, and\r\nthrough these, against Protestantism. One specimen of the higher order\r\nwe may give, from which some opinion may be formed of those vented in\r\nsmall places, by ignorant men, through low publications.\r\n\r\nWe speak of the great _Civiltá_,[181] of the \"metropolis of the\r\nChristian world,\" and of a deliverance of the Capitol itself. The plan\r\nof the Garibaldians, insists the _Civiltá_, in October 1867, was to\r\nseize the Capitol and to ring the great bell, at the sound of which\r\nall over Rome their hordes were to rise. But Anna Maria Taigi, who had\r\ndied thirty years before, in the odour of sanctity, had seen prophetic\r\nvisions of Rome wasted with fire and sword, and dreadful with heaps\r\nof unburied corpses, breeding dire pestilence. Some thought that 1849\r\nmight have been the fulfilment of the vision; others that it was\r\nthe attempt of 1867. But by the special \"devotion\" to this saintly\r\nwoman, such dread event was to be averted. On the evening when all\r\nfelt that the shock was coming, but no one saw whence or how, a priest\r\nof ninety years old, \"well known to all in Rome,\" said to another,\r\n\"I feel assured that the venerable Anna Maria will defend the city;\r\nand her image must at once be carried to the Capitol, for that is the\r\npoint they will aim at; the Capitol once saved, Rome belongs to the\r\nPope.\" The other priest objected that the hour was late and the streets\r\nunsafe. The old man insisted, reassured him, blessed him, and sent him\r\naway with the image, charging him to place it on the highest point.\r\nAs the priest, bearing the image, reached the steps of the Capitol, a\r\nfriend from a window, perceiving him, earnestly warned him to go home.\r\nTrembling, yet resolute, he pressed up the hill. All was silent as a\r\ndesert. Having reached the utmost height under the bell-tower, he was\r\nfixing up the image, when he heard people move, and a door opened. A\r\nwoman appeared. \"I came,\" said he, \"solely for the purpose of setting\r\nup an image.\" It would appear that it was a picture, for he had brought\r\nwafers with him to fasten it. Carlotta (for that was the woman's name)\r\nlooked at the image, and cried, \"Why, that is the venerable Anna Maria\r\nTaigi; I also practise devotion to her.\" The priest withdrew in silence\r\nand in haste. Meanwhile a priest from Bologna went in to visit the\r\nnonagenarian devotee of Anna Maria. \"Don Pedro,\" cried the old man,\r\n\"the Venerable has taken possession of the Capitol in the name of the\r\nPope, and she will defend it from the Garibaldians.\" The attempt on the\r\nCapitol was almost immediately made and failed. Those who remember the\r\ntale of the Capitol when Brennus was the Garibaldi will be tempted to\r\nask how great is the present elevation of faith above that of the days\r\nof the sacred geese.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 179: Bryce (p. 177) quotes from the second excommunication\r\nof Henry IV by Hildebrand as follows: \"Come now, I beseech you, O\r\nmost holy and blessed Fathers and Princes, Peter and Paul, that all\r\nthe world may understand and know that if ye are able to bind and\r\nto loose in heaven, ye are likewise able on earth, according to the\r\nmerits of each man, to give and to take away empires, kingdoms,\r\nprincedoms, marquisates, duchies, countships, and the possessions of\r\nall men.\"--_Holy Roman Empire._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 180: _Guérin_, pp. 61, 62; _Friedberg_, p. 82.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 181: VII. vii. 432 ff.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nGreat Ceremony of Executive Spectacle, called a Pro-Synodal\r\nCongregation, to forestall Attempts at Self-Organization on the part\r\nof the Council--The Scene--The Allocution--Officers appointed by\r\nRoyal Proclamation--Oath of Secrecy--Papers Distributed--How the Nine\r\nhad foreseen and forestalled all Questions of Self-organization--The\r\nAssembly made into a Conclave, not a General Council--Cecconi's Apology\r\nfor the Rules.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe event now to be described was called a Pro-Synodal Congregation.\r\nBeing designed to give parliamentary effect to secret decisions of\r\nthe Court, it was in reality a Ceremony of Executive Spectacle. Such\r\na description seems obscure, but the official name is misleading.\r\n_Congregation_ is the word used in Councils for deliberative sittings,\r\nin which measures are proposed and debated, in contrast to _Sessions_,\r\nwhich mean only grand public solemnities, where decrees already voted\r\nare formally adopted. Therefore the word Congregation would suggest\r\ndeliberation and some sort of consultative participation, by the\r\nbishops, in the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThis prelude to the Council was not a vain show, but had been contrived\r\nby the best diplomatic and artistic skill of the Curia. After the\r\nDirecting Congregation had spent nine months in elaborating rules\r\nof procedure to bind the bishops neck and foot, the Nine began to\r\nsee that, should the Council meet before it was organized, it might\r\nfall into the temptation to organize itself. Some one skilled in\r\nparliamentary forms might move to elect officers, and to have, as in\r\nformer times, open discussion, in order to hear questions of theology\r\nargued by the doctors, before they, the judges, began to frame their\r\nsentence. Some one might even suggest that they should agree upon their\r\nown rules of procedure. Now, all these points had been irrevocably\r\nsettled beforehand against the episcopate by its superiors, and any\r\nattempt to discuss them might cause the greatest confusion. If some\r\nspirit, perhaps like Darboy, as is gravely said, \"excessively enamoured\r\nof liberty,\" should once stir such questions, the records of Trent were\r\nthere to show that it might cause trouble to settle them. Therefore\r\nthe Nine were disquieted. Such possibilities must be forestalled.\r\n\r\nMoreover it had been resolved that, to take time by the forelock, the\r\nall-important Rules should be printed in advance, and should, before\r\nany possible self-action of the Council, be distributed during the\r\ngrand public ceremonial of opening. Doubtless, when first adopted, this\r\nresolution seemed not only satisfactory, but far-seeing. It was not\r\ntill as late as the month of August that some one pair of eyes among\r\nthe Nine caught sight of the fact that, the opening ceremony being\r\nlegally a Session of the Council, some \"advanced spirit\" might take\r\nadvantage of that circumstance to assert that the Rules, being issued\r\nin a sitting of the Council, were an act of the Council, and therefore\r\nwere liable to revision by it. That would never do. Therefore, at two\r\nsittings, on August 16 and 22, the former resolution was rescinded,\r\nand the ingenious expedient was devised of the Ceremony of Executive\r\nSpectacle now to be described. The Rules could be issued as part of the\r\nceremony, and thereby would every pretext for declaring them an act of\r\nthe Council be forestalled.\r\n\r\nThe Sixtine Chapel, connected in the imagination of the Fathers with\r\nall the glories and sanctities of their Church, was specially fitted up\r\nfor the event. From every region under heaven gathered prelates richly\r\nattired, each feeling the splendour of the scene, and consciously\r\naugmenting it. Their susceptibilities of spectacle were vividly awake.\r\nAs boys, those susceptibilities had been trained and forced. As men,\r\nthey had themselves trained and forced the same susceptibilities in\r\nothers. Now, in old age, they came to have the art of government by\r\nspectacle practised upon themselves; practised by masters to whom\r\ntheir consciences, sympathies, and imaginations taught them to look\r\nup. Under the skilled touch of those masters were they now about\r\nto let drop, without a word, and for the most part unconsciously,\r\nprivileges of their order, which had been guarded by their predecessors\r\nas carefully as they would themselves guard their episcopal rings. The\r\nplace, the men, the scene, the coming displays, and the dawning future,\r\nbig with events, were, for the moment, all in all to them. It was the\r\nhistoric eve of the day of days; and deep feeling fluttered under their\r\nsilk and brocade and gold.\r\n\r\nBefore their eyes spread the wonderful painting of Michael Angelo, in\r\nwhich, according to M. Frond he \"reproduced\" the scene of the last\r\njudgement. It is a monument to the power of genius, even when driven\r\nto work on what the true aesthetic of the painter told him should be\r\nleft to the imaging of the spirit, and should not be attempted by\r\nthe pencil. There, again, stood the vacant throne, waiting for him\r\nwho, when he first ascended it, had, as the reader will remember,\r\nthese words solemnly impressed upon his ear, in the house and by the\r\nministers of God: \"Know that thou art Father of princes and of kings,\r\nand art Governor of the World.\" The Cardinal Priests and Cardinal\r\nBishops were on the right of the throne, the Cardinal Deacons on\r\nthe left. Near it stood Patriarchs, Primates, and Archbishops, in\r\nregular gradation, and after them in regular gradation came Bishops,\r\nAbbots, and Generals of Orders. Every brilliant figure in that throng\r\nwas standing, except the Cardinals. Through a door, preceded by his\r\nhousehold, was see entering the form of him who holds the place of\r\nGod upon earth. The Sacred College stood up, all clad in violet, with\r\nrochette, mantelleta, and mozzetta. Then all cast themselves down upon\r\ntheir knees. The Pontiff, blessing his prostrate vassals, moved to the\r\nthrone, seated himself, and, with beaming visage looked paternally\r\ndown on the rulers of docile millions--rulers whose many-tinted\r\nsplendour was but the effluence of his own majesty.\r\n\r\nNow, in his hale, ringing voice, the Pope read an allocution. It\r\nexpressed much affection for his venerable brethren, and solicitude\r\nfor the success of their approaching deliberations. To those who had\r\ncome up full of confidence in the moderation of the Curia, all that\r\nthey heard was reassuring. To those who had been troubled with fears\r\nof hazardous innovation, the bearing and words of the initiated had\r\nbeen soothing, and so was all that now fell from the throne. Still, the\r\nfew who really studied would look in vain for light on the questions\r\nwhich had been agitated. Those who had such questions in their minds\r\ndid not know that from December to the middle of October the Nine had\r\nbeen engaged in answering them, and had already taken care that every\r\nseam through which any constitutional liberties might leak in should be\r\ntightly caulked.[182] Nor did they know that they were to-day gathered\r\ntogether for the very purpose of having many of these questions laid\r\nso deep that they should never rise again. Had they known the whole\r\nplan, was there one of them man enough to defeat it? Mighty against\r\ncivil authority, were they not weak as water against a higher and more\r\ndomineering priest?\r\n\r\nEven the few would hardly have time to realize the fact that the\r\npaternal and cordial allocution gave no light upon practical matters,\r\nwhen lo! Cardinal Antonelli on the right of the throne, and Cardinal\r\nGrassellini on the left! And, presently, Cardinal Clarelli, the\r\nSecretary of Briefs, comes forth and proclaims--\r\n\r\n    Our Most Holy Lord Pius IX, Pope, for the good ordering of things\r\n    to be done in this Council, as more largely contained in the\r\n    Letters Apostolic to be forthwith distributed, hath elected and\r\n    named Presidents of the General Congregations, to preside over the\r\n    same in his name and with his authority, the Most Reverend Lords\r\n    Cardinals Charles de Reisach, Bishop of the Sabina, Antony de\r\n    Luca, Joseph Andrew Bizzarri, Aloysius Bilio, and Hannibal Capalti\r\n    (_Acta_, p. 30).\r\n\r\nThis was immediately followed by the proclamation of the name of Bishop\r\nFessler as Secretary, and the names of other high officials. Upon this\r\nannouncement the Pope solemnly gave the pontifical benediction. Without\r\nthe Council, and before the Council, he had bound on earth the question\r\nof presidents, of secretary, of officers, and of rules. But his first\r\ndeed was not bound in heaven. Reisach, proclaimed by him as chief\r\npresident of the Council, was never to behold it.\r\n\r\nAs the Fathers took their seats, the master of the ceremonies led in\r\nPrince Orsini in the insignia of Prince-in-Waiting. The temporal prince\r\nkissed the sacred foot, and then took his place on the steps of the\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nNow a long line of dignitaries was presented, and going down on the\r\nground, formed a crescent of beautiful kneeling figures before the\r\nsovereign. Two Cardinal Deacons brought out the volume of the Holy\r\nGospels, and, standing close to the Pontiff, held it above his knees.\r\nMonsignor Jacobini then read out as follows--\r\n\r\n    We, elected by your Holiness officers of the General Vatican\r\n    Council, promise and swear upon the Holy Gospels, faithfully to\r\n    discharge the duties required of us respectively, and moreover not\r\n    to divulge or disclose to any one outside of the bosom of the said\r\n    Council, any of the matters proposed for examination in the said\r\n    Council, nor yet the discussions, nor the speeches of individuals,\r\n    but on all these, as also upon other matters committed to us, to\r\n    observe inviolable secrecy.[183]\r\n\r\nThereupon, each one rising in turn, and advancing in front of the\r\npriest-king, laid his right hand upon the book, held by the two Princes\r\nof the Church, and then said: \"I, N.N., promise, vow, and swear,\r\naccording to the tenor of the words just read. So help me God and these\r\nGod's Holy Gospels!\" He then kissed the book and the sacred foot.[184]\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the long succession rose John Baptist de Dominicis\r\nTosti, and stood to take the oath as one of the promoters of the\r\nCouncil. Suppose that a voice had at that moment cried: \"Some two years\r\nhence, this de Dominicis Tosti and Prince Chigi shall sit side by side\r\nwith two ministers of the Reformed Faith, as joint presidents over a\r\npublic discussion, in this city, on the question whether Peter ever\r\nvisited Rome, between Catholic priests on the one side, and Evangelical\r\nministers on the other.\" What an anathema would have burst from the\r\ndisgusted prelates! No such shadow of an impossible shade dimmed the\r\nbrilliancy of the scene.\r\n\r\nWhile under the various charms of that scene, the beauty of the\r\ncolours, the perfection of the postures, and the grace of the men,\r\nfew would remark that the form of oath, binding, as it did, to strict\r\nsecrecy on the very subjects discussed, and even on speeches, turned\r\ntheir forthcoming assembly from a General Council into a Roman\r\nconclave. A few indeed might see, but the overwhelming majority would\r\nnot see, that several points which Councils had settled for themselves,\r\neven when they met under Emperors, were now being splendidly settled\r\nfor them beforehand--in their presence, indeed, but without their\r\nco-operation, and scarcely with their consciousness. How could they\r\nthink of such commonplace affairs in a moment like that? What with\r\nthe glorious garments of the Sacred College, the stars and ribbons of\r\nPrince Orsini, the beauty of the enthroned Priest-King, the crescent\r\nof kneeling dignitaries before him, and the touching symbol of the\r\ntemporal prince kissing the priestly foot and reverently waiting at the\r\npriestly throne, there was enough to dazzle men less under the spell\r\nof robes. True, the temporal prince was here but a pale reminiscence\r\nof better days--of those days which some of them had called to the\r\nmind of the people since the gathering of 1867; days when kings, ere\r\nthey received the crown, lay prostrate before the altar, and swore on\r\ntheir knees to administer canon law; days when they had, moreover, to\r\ntake both sword and sceptre from the hands of the bishop.[185] Still,\r\nthis temporal prince served to assert rights which had never been\r\nrenounced, and was a comforting token of brighter times after the\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the swearing of the officers over, than the Pope took his\r\ndeparture. Then came the master of the ceremonies, and distributed some\r\npapers to the Fathers.[186]\r\n\r\nThey proved to be the Allocution just delivered, the Program of\r\nCeremonies for the opening of the Council, and another document,\r\nLetters Apostolic--longer, and seemingly duller, than the Program.\r\nBut this, too, was distributed by the master of ceremonies. At Courts\r\nwhere government by spectacle is preferred to government by reason,\r\nceremonies enclose a wide area. What was the right of proposition, or\r\nthe right of definition, or the right of public discussion, or the\r\nright of printing, or the right of meeting, in comparison with the\r\nproper places, forms, and postures? Did not Article 136 direct that\r\nthe sacred pallium was to be taken off the Holy Father by the Cardinal\r\nDeacon, and to be delivered over to the Sub-Deacon Apostolic? Did not\r\nArticle 39 direct that the Sub-Deacon Apostolic, accompanied by two\r\njudges of the High Court of the Signet, should bear the slippers to\r\nthe throne; and Article 40 direct that the Pontiff should put them\r\non?[187] Probably for one bishop who after retiring looked first into\r\nthe fateful Rules, ninety would look into the Program.\r\n\r\nIt was two days after the issue of these documents that Professor\r\nFriedrich arrived in Rome. He found the Archbishops of Munich and\r\nBamberg and the Bishop of Augsburg with the Program in their hands,\r\nand also the Rules of Procedure. They were full of confidence that\r\nthe Curia did not intend to propose anything dangerous. But Friedrich\r\nwanted to learn what were the subjects to be proposed, on which point\r\nthe bishops knew nothing. The members of Commissions had all been\r\nbound by oath to conceal, even from their own diocesans, what was\r\nprepared for them to vote. It was to be presented to them with this\r\nalternative: Vote it, or become marked men!\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Palazzo Valentini, Friedrich found that all that was\r\nknown by Cardinal Hohenlohe as to the subjects which he would have\r\nto vote upon amounted to this--a few days previously Cardinal de\r\nAngelis had asserted that nothing would be done beyond condemning the\r\nprinciples of 1789. This proves that the purple, at least of Cardinal\r\nHohenlohe, was kept as far aloof from the secrets of the Nine as the\r\nblack of Friedrich. Quirinus says (p. 77) that the most distinguished\r\ntheologian in Rome, Cardinal Guidi, was not only kept in perfect\r\nignorance of all that was being prepared, but was never admitted to an\r\naudience with the Pope after he had expressed to him his own views.\r\nAnother notability is said by the same author to have been also out\r\nof the circle of the trusted, and many writers share this view; this\r\nwas Father Beckx, the General of the Jesuits. Words ascribed to him\r\nby Quirinus are these: \"To recover two fractions of the States of the\r\nChurch they are pricking on to a war against the world; but they will\r\nlose all.\"\r\n\r\nFriedrich found that the decision of constitutional points of vital\r\nimportance was to be wrapped up in a gay gauze of ceremonies. The\r\nvery form to be given to the Decrees was slipped in among the items\r\nof the pageant. The conciliar formula used at Trent was replaced by\r\nthat of Papal Bulls. The collective hierarchy were not to be permitted\r\nto say, It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us; nor to say, This\r\nHoly Council ordains and decrees. The name of the Pope alone was to\r\nappear as decreeing, and the only words in the decree indicating the\r\nexistence of any Council were \"The Holy Council approving.\" Matters\r\nlike this, affecting not only the framework of the Church, but the seat\r\nof dogmatic authority, were settled without a note of preparation, in\r\na program of ceremonies, among directions about faldstools, incense,\r\nand the Pope's slippers. It was as if the Lord Chamberlain, when the\r\nQueen was about to open a new Parliament, should put out a program\r\nof precedence, costumes, and ceremonies, foisting in a few clauses\r\nindicating that Her Majesty would promulge a statute or two, with the\r\napprobation of the assembled Lords and Commons. It would be no trifle\r\nif he did so of his own motion, but would become tremendously serious\r\nif it had been done with full cognizance of the monarch.[188]\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the keen-eyed Professor was driven from the Program to\r\nthe Rules of Procedure. But the fact that the other was the document\r\nfirst read, even by him--a man in whom the decorative element is\r\nevidently too feeble for a useful priest, and the critical element too\r\nstrong--indicates the direction which the studies of gentlemen like\r\nhis archbishops and bishops would take; gentlemen, who knowing that\r\nthey had been jealously kept in the dark respecting what they were to\r\nbe called to vote upon as the faith of their Church for ever, were\r\nnevertheless satisfied, by a few bows and smiles, that it was to be\r\nsomething of no importance.\r\n\r\nFriedrich was deeply moved by what he found in the Rules, coupled with\r\nwhat he considered the ignorance of the bishops.\r\n\r\n    Every adept, he cries, must see that virtually the form here used\r\n    in propounding decrees contains Papal infallibility. It is the\r\n    Pope, and he alone, that defines and decides. Infallibility is\r\n    even now attributed to him, and not to the Council, and then,\r\n    seeing that this formula is to be acted upon in the first session\r\n    (or public ceremony), it is the Pope who formulates the decree\r\n    without having taken even the advice of the Council, and without\r\n    any discussion on its part. It is not so much as known what are to\r\n    be the subjects of the Decrees which the Council will adopt; and\r\n    yet Decrees containing definitions are announced for the 8th. What\r\n    can this mean? Are we really to have Papal infallibility carried\r\n    by acclamation, as the _Civiltá_ suggested, or shall we only have\r\n    a Decree, as they had at Trent, declaring the Council open, and\r\n    regulating the mode of life of its members? Who can tell? For my\r\n    own part I am uncommonly disquieted (p. 10).\r\n\r\nThis disquietude of Friedrich represented the first shock of collision\r\nagainst sunk fences, which had cost the Nine long labour. According to\r\ntheir faithful historian, the \"most arduous and thorny of their tasks\r\nwas that of settling the procedure.\"\r\n\r\nIt was admitted by the Nine that, even in the fifth Lateran Council,\r\nthe question was put to the Fathers, whether the Rules drawn up were\r\nacceptable. It was also feared that the bishops might be offended\r\nif the Pope settled the Rules without hearing their opinion. But,\r\non the other side, there were three arguments: first, the danger of\r\n\"interminable\" discussions; secondly, the danger of \"some spirit\r\nexcessively enamoured of liberty, and of too advanced opinions\"; and,\r\nthirdly, the history of former Councils (p. 148). So in June it was\r\nfinally determined that the Council should not be permitted to have a\r\nword to say to its own rules and forms of procedure. And in August, as\r\nwe have seen, the perfect plan of forestalling all attempts to say a\r\nword upon them was contrived.\r\n\r\nOne possible objection was brought under attention, by the history of\r\nprevious Councils, namely, that there might be a danger of the Pope\r\nrestraining the rightful liberty of the bishops. This idea, however,\r\nwas dispersed by the light logic which passes at Court. \"It would be no\r\nless a folly than an insult to think that a pontifical law could aim at\r\nlessening the liberty of the Council\" (p. 147). In this happy sentence\r\nthe now mitred historian refines on the words of M. Veuillot, who was\r\ncontent to say that all would be free because the Pope would be free.\r\n\r\nThe consultations of the Nine must have been serious upon the critical\r\npoint of denying to the Council the right of introducing proposals.\r\nThe course finally decided upon called for boldness in the deed,\r\ncombined with art in the drapery. It was first settled that the right\r\nof proposition _belonged_ to the Pope alone. Then it was argued that\r\nif this right was _granted_ to the bishops, \"it would turn the Council\r\nitself into a constitutional assembly\"--which was just what, with all\r\ntheir faults, the earlier Councils had been, and even that of Trent, in\r\nan inferior degree.\r\n\r\nThe serious question of excluding all members of the Church but those\r\nconstituting the Council had to be faced. Cecconi cannot conceal that\r\nat Trent the entrance to the Council Hall, during the discussions of\r\nthe Doctors, was free. Massarellus, the indefatigable secretary of\r\nthat Council, in his minute of those present at the first session,\r\ngives more names of laymen than of archbishops. The insertion of their\r\nnames means more than that they were in the building--they had seats\r\nof honour.[189] The number of the order of priests present at that\r\nfirst sitting far exceeded that of the bishops. True, they had no vote;\r\nbut they had a most important office, that of discussing points of\r\ndoctrine, in the presence of the bishops, before the latter themselves\r\nbegan to do so. They were the Bar, the prelates, the Bench. Massarellus\r\nhimself, secretary from the beginning, was only a doctor, till the\r\nCouncil reached the days of Pius IV, who made him a bishop.[190]\r\n\r\nAll the dragooning of the middle ages had not taught men that it was\r\nright for millions to sit outside in the dark, while a few priests\r\nconsulted, and determined how their creeds, catechisms, ordination\r\nvows, marriage obligations, parental rights, and national duties were\r\nto be altered. The vast changes consummated at Trent had not yet\r\ndone their work in reducing the human mind to servility. The Bible\r\nhad not been shackled by a General Council. The Press had not been\r\nscientifically gagged. Authors and booksellers had not felt the\r\nscourge of the Index. Schools and colleges had not been shut up against\r\ndiscussion and free inquiry, in any such degree as was then introduced.\r\nConsequently the Western Catholic of that day, though in a sense Roman,\r\nwas by no means that passive creature of priestly authority into which\r\nthree centuries of the sway of the Tridentine Decrees, administered\r\nby a monarch never checked by a public legislature, have moulded the\r\nmodern layman.\r\n\r\nAt Trent the people were present to hear what was said. At the Vatican\r\ntheir political position and religious belief were both to be decided\r\nupon by decrees not reformable, like all that men do; but irreformable,\r\nas if God had made them. Yet the presence of the people was looked\r\nupon as \"the interference of persons from without,\" and this, it was\r\nfelt, would be \"a deplorable inconvenience,\" notably aggravated by the\r\ntemper of the times because of the enormous diffusion of the Press.\r\nThe journals could not be prevented from writing about the Council;\r\nbut means were sought to keep the subjects under discussion from the\r\nknowledge of the \"democracy,\" as Maret calls priests and people. They\r\nshould learn the tenor of Decrees adopted only when they were ratified\r\n(_Cecconi_, p. 253). To this end, three points were resolved upon:\r\nfirst, the General Congregations (that is, the deliberative sittings)\r\nshould be altogether private; secondly, the public Sessions (that is,\r\nthe grand solemnities for adopting and promulgating Decrees already\r\nframed and voted) should be open only in the liturgical part, the\r\nlegislative part being strictly close; thirdly, all the Fathers and\r\nofficers should be bound to the deepest silence (p. 254).\r\n\r\nWe are far from saying that the bishops of the time before Trent would\r\nhave accepted a Roman conclave like this, in lieu of a General Council\r\nof the Catholic Church; but if they had done so, the laity of that\r\ntime, from Emperor to burgher, would not have suffered it. The laity\r\nthen did not represent the offspring of ten generations successively\r\nconfined in the Tridentine cribs. Their rights, though roughly defined,\r\nwere readily asserted, and sturdily maintained.\r\n\r\nThe Directing Congregation, having now existed for nearly five years,\r\nhad preordained all that was to come to pass in the Council. It had\r\nheld fifty-nine formal meetings, very many of which were devoted to\r\nthe Rules of Procedure. Beyond the purpled Nine, not a soul was ever\r\nadmitted, save only Monsignor Giannelli, their secretary. Five of the\r\nNine were the destined Presidents of the Council. So that, of the\r\nwhole College of Cardinals, only four besides the Presidents were in\r\nthe secrets of this body. Just at a few of the last meetings, Bishop\r\nFessler, the secretary of the Council, was called in. It is not needful\r\nto say that the Directing Congregation was in constant official\r\ncommunication with the Pontiff.[191]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: _Cocconi_, p. 161.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 183: _Acta_, p. 32.

Not only prelates came,\r\nbut champions of the sword, the pen, and the tribune, ready to face the\r\nworld in the cause of the Pope-King. Count Henri de Riancey begs pardon\r\nof Rome for indulging, at such a moment, in a word for France. Yet his\r\nheart does not turn to France, except on account of what she has done\r\nfor the Pope.\r\n\r\n    Let Rome, the fatherland of all fatherlands, permit to us this\r\n    flash of patriotism. It is France which has the honour of guarding\r\n    the last fragments of the pontifical dominions ... She has loved\r\n    righteousness; and that is the reason why she is anointed with the\r\n    oil of gladness above her fellows (_Frond_, vol. i. p. xix.).\r\n\r\nPoor France! that love of righteousness, which had made her slay so\r\nmany Italians to keep up the temporal power, was not to avert from her,\r\n\"in the year of the Council,\" a baptism other than that of the oil of\r\ngladness.\r\n\r\nOrdinary Christians would not catch the reference in the above\r\nquotation. To them, \"loving righteousness,\" especially when connected\r\nwith the person of the Messiah, is not identified with, but in holy\r\nopposition to, the idea of setting Christian ministers in rank before\r\nsecular princes, and in power above kings. But \"He loved righteousness\r\nand hated iniquity\" stands upon the tomb of Hildebrand, who sought to\r\nestablish the \"dominion of Christ,\" the \"kingdom of God,\" the \"reign\r\nof righteousness,\" or as many similar expressions as you please, by\r\nsubjecting all the kings of the earth to the Priest of God. Pius IX is\r\nfrequently spoken of as the founder of the lordship of the Pope over\r\nthe whole earth in the future, as Hildebrand was the founder of his\r\nlordship over it in the past. Therefore the sweetness felt by a good\r\nUltramontane in connecting the two together.\r\n\r\n    I am bewildered with joy, cried M. Veuillot. I try to depict that\r\n    joy, to swim in life. There is an unspeakable gladness in men's\r\n    souls. People feel an aurora. I picked up a number of journals,\r\n    and was going to answer a lively article against myself, in the\r\n    _Gazette de France_; but the author has no idea how all his\r\n    eloquence falls short of a man who, in one and the same day, has\r\n    seen Pius IX, Rome, and the Sun.\r\n\r\nPius IX had not admitted M. Veuillot to kiss the sacred foot for merely\r\nliterary service. The devoted advocate laid at the feet he kissed\r\nthree thousand pounds in money, collected, through his paper, for the\r\nexpenses of the Council. M. Veuillot scolds M. Taine grandly, for\r\nhaving made some comparison between Rome and Paris--Paris, stretching\r\nfrom the field of Pantin on one side, to the Follies Belleville on the\r\nother; and Rome, which has no limits but those of the world, and does\r\nnot accept those--Paris, which gives birth to M. Rochefort; and Rome,\r\nwhich directs the nineteenth OEcumenical Council! Had M. Taine seen\r\nRome yesterday, full of processions of all colours, and bishops of all\r\ncountries, he would have said it was more lovely than Paris.\r\n\r\nThe processions of all colours were no fancy stroke. Nine days of\r\nsolemn service in honour of the approaching anniversary of the\r\nImmaculate, and at the same time of the Council, gave an opportunity of\r\nshowing to strangers all the confraternities of Rome. They marched to\r\nthe various basilicas, especially to St. Peter's; the ostensible object\r\nbeing to worship the sacred relics which, with uncommon magnificence,\r\nwere exposed to their veneration.\r\n\r\nThe clergy of all lands saw and were seen with wonder and delight.\r\n\"When therefore,\" said Eusebius, speaking of Nicaea, \"the Emperor's\r\norder was brought into all the provinces, persons set out as if for\r\nsome goal, and ran with all imaginable alacrity, for the hope of good\r\nthings drew them, and the participation of peace, and lastly a new\r\nmiracle, to wit, the sight of so great an Emperor.\"[192] Dr. Friedrich\r\ndoes not express himself so prettily as Eusebius on the appearance of\r\nthe assembled clergy. The Asiatic cries, \"And one city received them\r\nall, as it were some vast garland of priests, made up of a variety of\r\nbeautiful flowers.\" The Bavarian says, \"The clergy of every country\r\nhave sent a strong contingent, from the proud monsignore to the\r\ndirtiest village priest.\"\r\n\r\nThe importance of sunny weather for public events, great everywhere,\r\nis perhaps exaggerated in Rome. Pius IX is believed to be peculiarly\r\nsusceptible to sunbeams. Three of his most memorable days are, by his\r\nadorers, connected with a sunburst which shone for him especially.\r\nProfessor Massi relates how, on the day of his taking \"possession,\" the\r\n_apostolic cortège_ followed the \"brilliant carriage\" of the new Pope\r\nfrom the Via Sacra up the Coelian Hill, the Cardinals being mounted on\r\n\"steeds richly adorned\"--doubtless worthy to be compared with those\r\nSicilian steeds which bore Gregory the Great, of whose stud Gregorovius\r\nsoberly says, \"We scarcely doubt but that Pindar would have thought the\r\napostolic horses worthy of an ode.\"[193] The day was overcast--which\r\nomen had a damping effect--but just as the new Pope approached the\r\nLateran, a glorious rainbow spanned the east, gladdening all with the\r\ncertainty of a reign of peace. In like manner, Professor Massi tells\r\nof that proud April evening when the Pontiff, after a long exile, once\r\nmore looked down upon the earth from his own Olympus. The clerical\r\nwriters do not exactly call it heaven, but content themselves with\r\nspeaking of the figure of the Pope so exalted, as \"standing between\r\nearth and heaven,\" or as a spectacle which reminds us of the Divinity\r\n(_Frond_, p. 16). The secularizing of sacred terms, till we come down\r\nto \"apostolic cortèges\" and \"apostolic horses,\" and the materializing\r\nof spiritual terms, till \"the kingdom of Christ,\" sometimes means the\r\ntemporal power, is a process which must go on until the heaven of the\r\nmaterialized imagination will be levelled to the height of the noblest\r\ndome, and to the beauties of the best decorator. The peerless piazza of\r\nSt. Peter's was, on the day in question, filled with French uniforms.\r\nAt the foot of the great staircase rose a platform covered with purple,\r\nand decked with flying banners. The heavens, all day covered with\r\nclouds, suddenly turned azure, and the setting sun poured his beams on\r\nthe dome of Michael Angelo, on the cross of the Obelisk, and on the\r\nstatues which adorn the Colonnade, just as Pius IX \"raised his paternal\r\nhand to bless the arms which had avenged his throne.\" The third day on\r\nwhich the sun shone expressly for Pius IX has been already mentioned,\r\nthat of the Immaculate Conception.\r\n\r\nIt was not only, as some say, the nuns, but also priests and\r\n_littérateurs_ who took it as both indispensable and certain that\r\nSt. Peter's should be bathed in the brightest gold the skies could\r\nsend on the day which was to unite three glories--the anniversary of\r\nthe Immaculate, the opening of the General Council, and the probable\r\nacclamation of Pius IX as infallible.\r\n\r\nOn December 7, when the midday gun was fired from St. Angelo's, a\r\npeal of joybells rang out from more than four hundred churches. From\r\nthe distant Coelian came the deep note of the Lateran, floating over\r\nColiseum and Capitol; from the Esquiline came that of Santa Maria\r\nMaggiore, floating over the Quirinal. These two met the boom of St.\r\nPeter's swinging across the Tiber, and, blending with it, formed, in\r\nthat sea of sound, a rolling base for the billows, on whose crests\r\nevery variety of bell-note clashed and sparkled. Far beyond the gates,\r\nthe lone and beautiful St. Paul's lifted up its voice, as if bidding\r\nthe untilled plains to tell the unfrequented shore that there was joy\r\nin the cloister capital.\r\n\r\nHints from Jesuit pens lead us to see some of the Order standing on\r\nthe Janiculum, by S. Pietro in Montorio, drinking in the view of the\r\nrenowned panorama, while the impressions of years would be brought to\r\na focus by the sensations of a moment. Every thrill would be taken\r\neither for a proof or a promise. Things done by the Order were being\r\nglorified, things to be done were being assured by the voice of many\r\nchurches. Before memory would rise the figures of Hildebrand, Dominic,\r\nIgnatius, illuminated by the imagination of the past. Before hope\r\nwould rise the figure of the new Hildebrand, with his now unlimited\r\nsceptre, and new Loyolas and Dominics, illuminated by the imagination\r\nof the future. Other German Henrys would be seen standing in penance,\r\nother English Johns signing away their supremacy: and surely if at\r\nIngolstadt the Order had trained a Ferdinand II, another could now be\r\ntrained, and the Virgin and St. Ignatius would not fail to raise up a\r\nmore successful Tilly, and a more faithful Wallenstein. \"Be wise now\r\ntherefore, O ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth,\" would\r\nseem ringing with articulate speech from the tongue of every bell.\r\n\r\nAs the _Ave Maria_ sounded in the sunset, the guns of S. Angelo saluted\r\nthe happy eve. The Pope rode in state to the Church of the Twelve\r\nApostles, and the crowd lined the entire way. The Jesuit writers heard\r\nenthusiastic cheers at every point. Some partial illuminations were\r\nattempted, but the weather was unfavourable. This, however, damped not\r\nthe spirits of any one, for there was to be a glorious illumination\r\non the morrow, when the rain was bound to cease. M. Veuillot, buoyant\r\nas were his spirits, admitted that, with all his love for Rome, he\r\ncould not deny that it rains there in winter. But hope was exulting,\r\nenthusiasm unbounded. The preparation of ideas had, it was thought,\r\ndone its work; the restoration of facts was now not far off. The\r\n_Civiltá_ asks, Did ever Council meet under such a Pope, with his\r\ngraces and his virtues, his rich experience, his burden of palms won\r\nin incessant victories over the enemies of Christ; the restorer of the\r\nhierarchy in two nations, the founder of many dioceses; the conqueror\r\nof the fallacies, hypocrisies, and fraudulence of the politicasters of\r\nour day, the glorifier of the Virgin, who \"sensibly\" covers him with\r\nher mantle, and takes delight in twining roses with the thorns whereof\r\nthe tiara that crowns him is altogether composed?[194] The words of\r\na French layman equal those of the Italian Jesuit. It is again the\r\nCount Henri de Riancey who cries, \"The Father of the Fathers, Sovereign\r\nPontiff of the Bishops, refuge of the bishops; he is the Universal\r\nPatriarch, the Prefect of the house of God, the Guardian of the\r\nvineyard of the Lord. He it is who confirms the faith of Christians;\r\nhe is Abraham in his patriarchate, Melchisedek in order, Moses in\r\nauthority, Samuel in jurisdiction, Peter in power, Christ in unction\"\r\n(_Frond_, i. p. xxx.).\r\n\r\nIt was St. Ambrose's day. M. Veuillot, in imagination, saw the saint\r\n\"appear on the threshold on which the eyes of the human species are\r\nfixed, full of hope,\" But M. Veuillot seldom meets with a saint, dead\r\nor living, but a political end soon appears. This was, he cries, a\r\nfelicitous rencounter. What made it so? When Ambrose had become bishop,\r\nhe excommunicated the Emperor Theodosius for the crime of inhumanity.\r\nHis image in this act is to M. Veuillot evidently the prototype of\r\nPius IX leaving the kings out of the Council. But it is one thing to\r\nrefuse the Communion, which was open for the humblest believer, to\r\nthe greatest potentate alive, because his word has wantonly handed\r\nhis subjects over to death; and it is another thing to refuse to all\r\nbelievers in existence a place, even as hearers, in the chamber where\r\nnew laws binding them and their children for ever are to be decreed.\r\n\r\nThe scene at Milan, and that at St. Peter's, similar to the ardent\r\nUltramontane, would strike us rather by contrast. On the former\r\nthreshold we see a Christian pastor guarding the Lord's Table. On the\r\nlatter, a king, and an aspirant after universal political supremacy,\r\nguarding the secret of his own counsels. Outside the Milan threshold\r\nwe see one sinner in purple, while the common Christians are free to\r\napproach. Outside the Vatican are all members of Churches whom the\r\nking in purple and scarlet acknowledges as members of his own Church.\r\nThe people are disfranchised with the princes at their head. The\r\npriests had long been losing their franchise in the election of their\r\nbishops. More recently they had been losing their freehold in their\r\nparishes. When the Jesuits obtained possession of Pius IX, the parish\r\npriest had a life interest in his parish subject to good behaviour.\r\nBut this formed too much of a tie to the nation. The parochial clergy\r\nhad to be mobilized. So, gradually, they had been put into berths\r\nonly by temporary appointment, and held the place _ad nutum_, at the\r\nnod of the bishop. They had been glad that the sword _in the hand_ of\r\nthe king should not be in his power, but at the nod of the priest. It\r\nwas scarcely so pleasant that the parish, in the hand of the priest,\r\nshould be at the nod of the bishop. The making of it so had already to\r\na large extent been accomplished. It was now to be completed; but those\r\ntyrannous kings might attempt to check the move by what they would call\r\nprotecting the lower clergy, what the Vatican would call destroying the\r\nliberty of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe whole spirit of the Jesuit Press at this period indicated that\r\nthe Modern State had so wearied out the Vatican that the only chance\r\nfor kings to make their peace with it would lie in separating their\r\ncause from that of parliaments and constitutions. If they meant to\r\nbe tolerated long after the Council, they must not only reign but\r\ngovern--govern Catholic States under the Syllabus. A ruler by divine\r\nright--which among the baptized means one instituted by the Pope and\r\ncorrected by him--is the essence of the matter. \"THE POPE AND THE\r\nPEOPLE!\" is the last exclamation of M. Veuillot, on the eve of the\r\nday when the nations were to come to judgment--on the eve of the day\r\nwhen the salutary conspiracy recommended by the _Civiltá_ with its\r\nfirst breath was to hold its crowning conclave, when the holy Crusade,\r\nheralded with the same breath, was to receive both its legal warrant\r\nand its world-wide impulse. A triumphal arch was to mark the completion\r\nof a stage of toil and the entrance upon a stage of transformation.\r\n\"THE POPE AND THE PEOPLE. I believe that these words are invisibly\r\nwritten on the door of this Vatican Council, which door forms the\r\nentrance to a _new world_; rather is it a triumphal arch erected on the\r\nrediscovered highway of the human race.\"[195]\r\n\r\nThat triumphal arch and that rediscovered way of the human species\r\nwhich, to M. Veuillot, made the entrance to the Vatican Council\r\nsublime, invested it, to the eyes of Liberal Catholics, with clouds\r\nof doubtful omen. The triumph vaunted was real and even stupendous,\r\nbut it was a triumph over the principles in the name of which\r\nLiberal Catholics had fought and won the battles of the Church. The\r\nrediscovered way was no other than the broad road of clerical dominion\r\nover spiritual and temporal things which, in the ages before the\r\nReformation, had led the Church down to a degree of corruption now\r\ndenied by none--a broad road, which had since then been swept and\r\nmended, but to which had in the meantime been added the countless\r\nsidepaths of Jesuit morals. If all those sidepaths should by authority\r\nbe opened for the winding and the straying of human guile and passion,\r\nwhat would the Catholic nations come to? Studious Liberal Catholics\r\nwere aware of the two sides of the Jesuit system of morals, whereof\r\nProtestants generally were cognizant only of one. These knew, indeed,\r\nthat a lawful end renders the means to it lawful; but Liberal Catholics\r\nknew that it was also taught that an unlawful end did not infect with\r\nguilt the means by which it had been reached, provided only that in\r\nthemselves those means consisted of acts not necessarily unlawful. Thus\r\non both sides--that of seeking a lawful end by unlawful means, and that\r\nof employing lawful means for an unlawful end--was the gate made wider,\r\nthe road broader, and the way more smooth for guile to creep or passion\r\nto roll downward, but attended all along by the comforts of absolution,\r\nand sprinkled with holy water.[196]\r\n\r\nAnd as to the new world to which the Council was to be an entrance,\r\nLiberal Catholics had seen the Pope's special _college of writers_,\r\nin the _Civiltá_, dwell upon the act whereby Alexander VI drew a\r\nline from pole to pole, and gave to Spain all regions that should be\r\ndiscovered to the west of it, and to Portugal all those that should\r\nbe discovered to the east of it; and contend that the Pope, in saying\r\nof those regions, I _give_, _concede_, and _assign_ them to this king\r\nand to that, acted simply as the Vicar of Christ; nay, that by that act\r\nthe autonomy of the Indians was not in the least offended; and that,\r\nmoreover, what in the jargon of infidel and of heretics was called the\r\npretensions of Rome, was nothing else but the exercise of a clear and\r\nsublime right, resorted to by the Pope in seeking a solid protection,\r\nin new countries, for the autonomy of nations and of individuals, when\r\notherwise, to the offence of religion, it might have been violated by\r\nbarbarians.[197] But was this supreme power to dispose by sentence of\r\nthe lot of nations, even though unknown, without in so doing offending\r\nin the least against their rights, to be exalted into eternal dogma? If\r\nso, and if mankind would endure it, well might the door of the Council\r\nbe regarded as the entrance to a new world. But whether future ages\r\nwill reckon it as the entrance to a new world or not, we are about to\r\nsee that it was indeed the entrance to an arena on which was to be\r\nwitnessed a process of revolution from above and a struggle of priest\r\nwith priest,--a process as instructive, a struggle as curious, as any\r\nthat our age has produced, among its many transformations of polity and\r\nredistributions of power.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 192: _Life of Const._, lib. iii. cap. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 193: _Geschichte der Stadt Rom._ ii. p. 60.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 194: Serie VII. vol. ix. p. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: Vol. i. p. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 196: See Gury, especially his _Casus Conscientiæ_.

The bellowing of these beasts of war\r\nawoke the city to witness a Council of the ministers of peace. As the\r\nsounds reached the ear of peasant, monk, and nun, already plodding in\r\nthe dark from places outside the walls, the sky was low, and pouring\r\ndown a truly Roman rain. Unlike towns round which smiling homes are\r\nsown broadcast outside of the bounds, Rome, when approached by most of\r\nthe routes, first shows the city walls, and not till a good while later\r\ndoes it show the beginning of habitations. The poor suburbs which lie\r\noutside a few of the gates are less dreary than the space inside, where\r\nlonely roads, shut in by blank walls, lead amidst crumbling mementoes\r\nof rulers of the world, and marks of the actual reign of drones not\r\nable to master ordinary difficulties. Every now and then comes a\r\nchurch, or one of the two hundred and more convents and nunneries which\r\nsanctify the place. But scarcely any of these have an outline such as\r\nto yield, in twilight, the effect of either Gothic spires or Moorish\r\nminarets, or even of good Grecian colonnades.\r\n\r\nMany a cowled figure struggled under the drenching rain along these\r\ndesolate ways. One would pass the spot where Peter was arrested by\r\nhis Master, when the Fisherman uttered the famous \"Lord, whither\r\ngoest Thou?\" and was turned back to Rome to die. Another would pass\r\nby the vale of Egeria and he might well wonder if Numa ever had to\r\nseek inspiration there in such dismal gloom. Crossing the open ground\r\nabout the Lateran, some of the monks might think of the terrible morn\r\nwhen Totila, in mercy, halted his troops inside the gates, sending the\r\nclang of his trumpets through the dark, all over the city, to give the\r\nwretched Romans the chance of flight.\r\n\r\nOther monks coming from St. Agnese, and entering by the Porta Pia,\r\nwould reflect upon the adornment of that gate by the Holy Father, and\r\nupon its happy name which links it both with Pius IX and with its own\r\nfounder. Its founder, Pius IV, signed the Creed of the Council of\r\nTrent, and Pius IX was to sign the new Creed of the Council of the\r\nVatican. This beautiful coincidence would, with the monks, make the\r\ngate an emblem of the Church, against which the gates of hell should\r\nnever prevail. If they only happened to recollect that its old name\r\n_Nomentana_ marked it as the Mentana Gate, the encouraging impression\r\nwould rise almost to the brightness of a revelation. The day, only two\r\nyears before, when the conquering crusaders marched in, and the welkin\r\nrang with shouts of \"Long live Pius IX!\" \"Long live the zouaves!\"\r\n\"Long live the Crusaders!\" \"Long live Catholic France!\" would return\r\nto memory as the pledge of mightier Mentanas. Had an invisible hand\r\ndrawn aside the veil, and shown them that gate, some nine months later,\r\nadmitting the Italian troops, followed by the dog Pio drawing a little\r\ncart full of Bibles; and then shown, still later, the residence of a\r\nBritish Ambassador to the King of Italy inside the gate, and on the\r\noutside the residence of Garibaldi, the monks would have vowed by all\r\nthe saints, old and new, that the vision came from a lying spirit.\r\n\r\nSome, again, crossing the Tiber by the Milvian Bridge, would, in spite\r\nof the blinding rain, see the figure of Constantine victoriously\r\ndominating the heights, and that of Maxentius being hurled into the\r\nstream. A while afterwards, when passing near the Broken Wall, where\r\nSt. Peter himself had kept watch, and with his own hand had blinded and\r\nrouted the Goths, they would feel that now when his successor was to\r\nbe at last duly exalted, the Apostle would surely keep the city more\r\njealously than before; and if there was need of a Belisarius to crush\r\nthe Italian barbarians, the Lord would raise him up at the intercession\r\nof Peter.\r\n\r\nAs they came further inwards, the crowds of the city were already in\r\nmotion. Down from the Coelian and Esquiline were they pouring past the\r\nColiseum, reflecting men delighting in the thought that all high things\r\nwhich exalt themselves against the Church would fall into her power\r\njust as the Coliseum had done; for the \"high things\" of the Romanized\r\nimagination are naturally material ones. The Arch of Titus, darkly\r\noutlined in the morning grey, would be the prophetic pledge that the\r\nJews, however stubborn, would yield to the Pontiff at last. But where\r\nwas the golden candlestick--where the temple vessels? After Genseric\r\ncarried them off, had they ever returned? The ruinous Palatine would\r\nsymbolize woes coming to modern Caesars, as sure as those which had\r\ncrushed the ancient ones. Indeed, it is not impossible that some would\r\nsee visions like those seen by monks of yore, who beheld the soul of\r\nthe great Theodoric dragged into the crater of Stromboli.\r\n\r\nFrom the Aventine, where Peter resided with Priscilla and Aquila, and\r\nwhich is now little but a site for monastic establishments, many would\r\ncome, passing by the place where once stood the Circus Maximus. The\r\nthoughtful would there have in their eye the grand spectacles of Pagan\r\nRome. It was by a spectacle that Romulus allured the Sabines to unity\r\nby violence; and it was by a spectacle that Pius IX was now wooing\r\nthe world to wedlock with the Papacy--ready, if only able, to take\r\nshort measures with the coy. But what were the shows of the old rude\r\ntimes to this? What if three hundred thousand pairs of eyes did gleam\r\ntogether on the spectacles which, with bread, made up the earthly all\r\nof the Roman _plebs_? They never had looked upon such an array of holy\r\nbishops, from the whole earth, as would be seen to-day. The colours for\r\nwhich they went mad, their idolized blues and greens, were but few, and\r\nill-combined, compared with the colours now about to be displayed. The\r\nancient cry, \"Bread and Spectacles!\" was indeed still kept alive by\r\nRoman authorities, but was to-day to be satisfied in a Christian style\r\nglorious beyond Pagan example.\r\n\r\nAlong the Via Sacra few foreigners would appear, but from the\r\nCapitoline Germans would set out. It is natural to think of some\r\nstudent, fresh from the pages of Gregorovius, his imagination vividly\r\nsetting face to face the ancient Rome and the actual. He would think of\r\nthe exclamation, \"Renowned, queenly, immeasurable Rome, a sea of beauty\r\nsurpassing all power of speech!\" Where were the glory and the beauty\r\nnow? Inside the churches and palaces indeed were masses of decoration\r\nand artistic stores of wealth, but the city viewed, on that dismal\r\nDecember morning, as a city, was poor and ill-kept. The glory which\r\nonce compelled men at this central point to call her Golden Rome was\r\ndeparted. What now represented the Temple of Jupiter--its pillars on\r\ngilded bases with gilded capitals, its gates of gilded bronze, and its\r\nroof of tiles of gilded brass? There stands the Church of the Aracoeli;\r\nJupiter is succeeded by the Bambino, a doll, carved by St. Luke, which\r\nis driven in a stately carriage round the city to the beds of the dying.\r\n\r\nCrossing the Bridge of Sixtus the student might see vividly, as\r\nstudents do, the scene of that sacrilegious morning when the lone old\r\nstream, with no Horatius now, was swarthy boatmen swinging the oar with\r\nthe stroke of the rover, and as each galley shot out of the bend of the\r\nAventine, the chief, from under his turban, eyed the opening prospect\r\nof plunder with the glance of an Ishmaelite. When they rifled the\r\ngrave, would the student say, if they found anything of the Fisherman,\r\ncertainly they did not leave anything. If the ashes of Peter ever\r\ndid rest there, were they not sent by the Saracens to await those of\r\nWycliffe in the sea?\r\n\r\nA pamphlet, by a Hebrew, with the title of _The Ghetto and Rome's\r\nGreat Show_, reminds us that from under the flank of the Capitoline\r\nsome would come out of the pen in which the Popes had, for ages, shut\r\nup the children of Israel. No doubt some travelled Rabbi would do so.\r\nSuch a man would have mentally dwelt all his life among the ancients,\r\nand personally he would have seen the Pyramids and Thebes, the Tomb\r\nof Abraham, with Jerusalem, Baalbec, and probably the Remains upon\r\nthe Euphrates, if not those on the Tigris. To him Roman dates were\r\nmodern, and Roman monuments, though great for Europe, were on a scale\r\ncomparatively small, not equalling in magnitude those of Asia, not\r\napproaching in grace those of Hellas. In his eye all the princes of the\r\nancient monarchies laughed at the notion of Gregorovius, that the idea\r\nof a world-empire originated with the Romans--nay, no more than did the\r\nidea of the Trojan War.\r\n\r\nTowards Pius IX personally the feeling of the Jew would be rather\r\nkindly, for he, like Sixtus V, had relieved the Hebrews from some of\r\nthe severities to which they had long been subjected by preceding\r\nPopes. But this would not prevent the whole tormented past from rising\r\nin memory before the Rabbi and stirring him to hope that he might now\r\nbe going to witness the last show ever to be exhibited by one of the\r\ncruel race of the Pope-Kings. The pen in which his people had been shut\r\nup, the distinguishing badge, the differential taxes, the religious\r\nworry, and the manifold enormities committed upon them in the name of\r\nChrist who loved them, of Peter who lived for them, and of Paul who\r\ngave himself repeatedly to death for them, had long helped to set him\r\nand his on hating Christ, and Peter, and Paul. \"Hard as their lot was\r\nunder the Caesars,\" says our pamphlet, \"it became harder still when the\r\necclesiastical Head was crowned by Pepin Le Bref king of the States\r\nof the Church, and actually ruler of the world.\" The day was now past\r\nwhen the Corso, in carnival-time, rang with the shouts of so-called\r\nChristians, hailing the spectacle of Jews naked, except a girdle round\r\nthe loins and ropes round their necks, forced to run races against\r\nriderless mules, and asses, and buffaloes. For a long time this\r\nservice had been performed for the sacred city by riderless horses,\r\ngoaded by spiked balls slashing into their sides. Nevertheless, those\r\nformer days would rise up before the Rabbi's eye, as would also the\r\nprice paid for ransom. As he passed along, between him and the Corso\r\nstood the one pile still entire which to memory represented the Pagan\r\nRomanism under which his first ancestors in the city had suffered, and\r\nto the eye represented the Papal Romanism under which their descendants\r\nhad continued for so many ages to groan. Dedicated by Agrippa to Cybele\r\nand all the gods, it had been rededicated by Boniface IV to Mary and\r\nall the martyrs. Though still best known as the Pantheon, its name in\r\nRome is St. Mary of the Rotunda.\r\n\r\nOur Rabbi would naturally, on such an occasion, compare it as it had\r\nbeen and as it now is; for the associations of the day would suggest to\r\nhis mind that gathering of the provincials in the plain of Dura, when\r\nsome of his forefathers had to bear witness against the longing natural\r\nto those who imagine themselves heads of the human species, to set up\r\nnew idols, and to insist on unity by means more urgent than godly. That\r\nwas the first clearly recorded scene in the fiery drama of Catholic\r\nUnity; a unity bending, breaking, or burning all nations, peoples, and\r\ntongues into religious and political submission to one human head.\r\nProbably the Rabbi would admit that there was some ground of justice in\r\nthe words of _Joseph de Maistre_, that the Pantheon had been devoted\r\nto all the vices, and now was devoted to all the virtues. Thus far the\r\nChristian element in Papal Romanism had asserted its moral superiority.\r\nBut the Rabbi would feel that there was exaggeration upon both sides of\r\nDe Maistre's assertion. The gods of the Pagans were not all personified\r\nvices, any more than are now all those of the Hindus. Many of them were\r\nso, and that is enough. On the other hand, not all the saints of the\r\nPapal Pantheon represent personified virtues, judged by any code but\r\nthe sad one of the Popes themselves. The Rabbi would hardly recognize\r\nSt. Peter Arbues, red with the blood of thousands of the seed of\r\nAbraham, as one of the Virtues, any more than as one of the Graces.\r\nHe would, however, recognize the correctness of Joseph De Maistre's\r\nestimate of the kind of change made by the Popes in the Pantheon. He\r\nwould also admit the good judgment of M. Fisquet in selecting the\r\nfollowing passage of De Maistre, when describing the ceremonies of Rome\r\nfor Frond's history--[198]\r\n\r\n    It is in the Pantheon that Paganism is rectified and brought\r\n    back to the primitive system, of which it is only a visible\r\n    corruption. The name of God is exclusive and incommunicable.\r\n    Nevertheless, there are many _gods_, in heaven and in earth.\r\n    There are intelligences, better natures of deified men (_hommes\r\n    divinisés_). The _gods_ of Christianity are the _saints_. Around\r\n    God are assembled ALL THE GODS, to serve Him in the place and order\r\n    assigned to them.\r\n\r\nThe Rabbi might say, The Law pulls down the word \"gods,\" by applying it\r\nto magistrates, thus making it mean little; but these ignorant priests\r\nlift it up to mean something more than the Pagans ever did mean by it,\r\nas if the latter had imagined that each god was a supreme being, or\r\nsomething near it. De Maistre, however, had more sense. He knew that\r\n\"saints\" was another name for gods, only they were not to be vicious,\r\nwhich was no doubt the original idea.[199]\r\n\r\nBy this time the dull and dripping air would begin to vibrate with the\r\nroll of carriages. Both in the rain and under cover, the throng was\r\npouring towards one point. From the poor streets, where once stretched\r\nthe glorious Fora of the Caesars, from the old Suburra, from the\r\nregions covered by the gardens of Sallust, from the spot where the\r\npersecuting name of Diocletian and a splendid church are now locally\r\nassociated, from all the flanks of the Quirinal, would the stream\r\ncome pouring towards the old Field of Mars. Bishops, artists, and the\r\nmodels of the artists, priests and beggars, quaint peasants, handsome\r\nartisans, well-dressed tradesmen, pressed in slush and silence past the\r\nlone pillar of Trajan, nobly sad, standing amidst memories of might and\r\nsigns of impotence.\r\n\r\nIn the crowd speckled by ecclesiastical and peasant costumes, many an\r\nEnglish figure, both home and colonial, steadily made way, and many an\r\nAmerican one, and a few of the swarthy South Americans. At least one\r\nScotch bonnet and plaid pushed through the throng.[200] And he who wore\r\nthem saw the well-known cap of the German student. Though, in general,\r\nnot much addicted to attend solemnities, the Roman shopkeeper would on\r\nthis occasion be well represented. His motto had hardly been \"Bread and\r\nShows,\" but rather \"Shows and Bread.\" The city had, to a considerable\r\nextent, lived upon its exhibitions; and every grand one designed by the\r\npriests raised them in the eyes of shopkeepers, lodging-keepers, and\r\ncabmen.[201]\r\n\r\nThe grand Piazza of St. Peter's would have been at its grandest that\r\nday had the sky been true to the Papacy. Nothing but the heavens\r\nfailed. From every opening into the Piazza flowed the eager crowds.\r\nThey passed the two hundred and eighty columns, natives sheltering\r\nunder their umbrellas, strangers compelled by admiration to look\r\nup. They passed the Obelisk, those who had history in their memory,\r\nthinking of Nero and of the scenes by him enacted. They passed the\r\nInquisition, perhaps wondering what priests were imprisoned now, and\r\nif there were any bishops, and who; perhaps thinking how strange it\r\nwas that side by side should stand the memorials of Nero and the\r\nchambers of the Inquisition. Then up the steps and across the Portico.\r\nAt the same time, the coaches of the great swept to the right into the\r\nVatican. About three hundred of these were splendidly horsed, gilt\r\nround the top, gilt at all available points, hung high on springs,\r\nwith four or five servants, in yellow and blue, red and green,\r\nembroidered, powdered, and in cocked hats. The few pensive monuments\r\nof retrospective royalty that still clave to the skirt of the Pontiff,\r\nformed the first line of this array. Then came the thrice-splendid\r\nprinces of the Church. Each rode in his state carriage, followed, says\r\nFrond (vol. vii. p. 91), by a second carriage, \"less sumptuous.\" and\r\nif a prince--we presume by birth--followed by a third. Then came the\r\nnuncios, ambassadors, bishops, and notabilities with starry breasts,\r\nand ribbons like streamers among the stars--stars that dazzle Romans\r\nfar more than all the constellations in the sky. The Roman nobles,\r\nalways splendid, were that day in their fulness of gold, and pearls,\r\nand costly array; and their equipages are said to have counted several\r\nhundreds. No less than five hundred private ones and some two thousand\r\nstreet carriages completed the train. Roman ecclesiastics could not\r\nhelp remarking, even in print, that from a one-horse hackney coach\r\nmight be seen alighting a couple of bishops, and four from a two-horse\r\none; a sight which they contrasted with the princely splendour of\r\nConstance and of Trent. At the bridge of St. Angelo, and at other\r\nimportant points, rose up in the rain the mounted figures of the\r\nPapal dragoons in their long white cloaks. A plentiful display of\r\nsoldiers, said to amount to about six thousand, increased the variety.\r\nBlack-clad Barnabite, and brown Franciscan, broad-hatted Jesuit and\r\nwhite Camaldolese, with all the costumes of the barrack, the convent,\r\nthe nunnery, mingled with those of the drawing-room and the village\r\nfestival, spangled the thickening crowd.\r\n\r\nThe clergy of the city had early assembled in sufficient number to\r\nline the whole course of the procession, until it reached the statue\r\nof St. Peter. Within, the crowd is not represented by any writer as\r\nhaving been excessive. Some say that the church was full, some that\r\nit was not quite so. The people arrived in wet clothing, and as none\r\nof them, least of all the monks, were given to excessive ablutions,\r\neven the correspondent of the _Stimmen aus Maria Laach_ alluded to\r\nthe quality of the air. So also did the Special Correspondent of the\r\n_Times_; but he remarked that \"incense covers a multitude of perfumes.\"\r\nIn the various side chapels, Masses were being celebrated, each priest,\r\nas he came up to the altar, or retired from it, being preceded by two\r\nsoldiers under arms, and followed by one. There were upon duty in that\r\ntemple of peace, opened for a great council of peace, one battalion of\r\nzouaves and one of the line.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers of Diocletian and Galerius, when beginning their work one\r\nFebruary morning, while the two Emperors watched them from their palace\r\nwindows in Nicomedia, would not have been so much at a loss had they\r\nentered a temple like St. Peter's, as they found themselves in the\r\nChristian church into which they then broke. \"They searched in vain,\"\r\nsays Gibbon, \"for some visible object of worship. They were obliged to\r\ncontent themselves with committing to the flames the volumes of the\r\nHoly Scriptures.\" They could have found no Bible in St. Peter's to\r\nburn, unless they had taken to a sumptuous book, in a dead language,\r\ncontaining portions of the Gospels. But they would not have searched\r\nin vain for visible objects of worship. Just as even Father Abraham\r\nhad been turned into chief idol in the Caaba by the heathen Arabs, so\r\nhere the chief of the images set up was Peter. But never had he been\r\nso dressed in Galilee or Jerusalem, in Antioch or Babylon, with alb,\r\ngirdle, stole, and tiara. The Popes might have ill copied the living\r\nPeter, but the bronze Peter had well copied the Popes. The Fisherman\r\nwould have been surprised at his own pluvial. As clerical writers\r\nwould blush not to tell, it was of red silk, striped with gold. On his\r\nbreast was a golden cross; on his right hand a golden ring, with a\r\nlarge ruby, and a circle of \"flashing brilliants,\" and the left hand\r\nheld a golden key all decked with precious stones. Before him burned\r\na lamp, and four superb wax candles painted like the illuminations of\r\nbooks. As all men honour their gods with what they value most, the\r\nVatican honours Peter by feeding the jeweller and laceman in his soul\r\nwith marrow and fatness, and by the sight of men kissing his feet.\r\nPeter had his faults, but he never deserved to be so paganized. True,\r\nhe did forget himself when he got into the palace of the Jewish priest,\r\nbut not in the same way as the bishop on the Tiber forgot himself\r\nwhen he got into the palace of the Roman Pontiff. That, however, was\r\nPeter before he was converted. Peter, after he was converted, passed\r\nthe threshold of a Roman. Then, he strengthened his brethren, not by\r\nlording it either over their persons or their faith, but by teaching\r\na lesson in action, to the effect that no human being should ever\r\ndegrade his person before a fellow-man, and that the forms of worship,\r\nas well as the spirit of it, are to be reserved for Him whom alone it\r\nis lawful for the offspring of God to adore. Peter would not break the\r\ncommandment that said, \"Be not ye called rabbi: for one is your Master,\r\neven Christ; and all ye are brethren. And call no man your father upon\r\nthe earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven. Neither be ye\r\ncalled masters: for one is your Master, even Christ\" (Matt. xxiii.\r\n8-10).\r\n\r\nThere in a nutshell lies the whole theory of a direct government as\r\nagainst one by proxy; of a father's government of adult sons, as\r\nagainst a master's government of slaves through upper servants; of one\r\nall-watching love, and one all-working care, as against an imperial\r\nreclusion that leaves affairs to departmental divinities. \"Our Father\r\nwhich art in heaven,\" deeper is Thy love to the least of us, more\r\ntender and closer far than could be that of any patron whom we might\r\nset up! In numbering the hairs of our heads, no Vicar dost Thou employ!\r\nIn drawing near to Thee, no interest of Thy freedmen do we require,\r\nfor we are no longer slaves, but in Thy love, the love of a Father,\r\ndost thou invite every one of us to the adoption and therefore to the\r\naccess of sons!\r\n\r\nHe, who had once shaken his brethren, did not afterwards strengthen\r\nthem by telling them that they must all accept him as rabbi, father,\r\nand master in the absence of their Lord, while to him there was but one\r\nMaster, Christ. Just as Peter was ready, in his own person, to keep the\r\ncommandment, \"Be not ye called masters,\" so would he have been the very\r\nfirst to uphold the corresponding commandment, \"Call no man master.\" He\r\nwell knew that this applied pointedly and particularly to the ministers\r\nand disciples of the religion of Christ as such; for he was one of\r\nthe first to teach both due reverence and due obedience to that civil\r\nauthority which the Popes live to make little more than a sword under\r\ntheir own power.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Protestant and the Rabbi would both watch the thousands\r\nperforming the adoration of St. Peter. The Italian Protestant would\r\nthink of rites to Romulus, or perhaps to Hercules, whose local story\r\nwas still more mythical. The Rabbi would think with scorn of the\r\nimpossibility of such a spectacle in a synagogue over a dressed-up\r\nimage of Aaron, for the Jews had never reformed the decalogue. He would\r\nmentally quote Jeremiah: \"The stock is a doctrine of vanities. Silver\r\nspread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the\r\nwork of the workman, and of the hands of the founder; blue and purple\r\nis their clothing, they are all the work of cunning men.\"[202] Educated\r\nHindus are now often to be seen in Rome. Any of them who witnessed\r\nthis scene, and heard priests complacently point out the distinctions\r\nby which simple Westerns are lulled into the notion that this is\r\ntheoretically a different kind of worship from that paid to lesser gods\r\nand to images by Brahmans, would take the distinctions in his supple\r\nfingers and snap them as easily as he would so many threads of the\r\nfinest Dacca looms. The Pundits were in this, as in many things, elder\r\nand abler brethren of the priests.\r\n\r\nFriedrich, in his Doctor's robes, formed one of the promiscuous crowd;\r\nfor mere theologians in Rome did not pass for much. No one has told\r\nus where Quirinus stood, or what was his toilet. It is not even clear\r\nwhether his spirit was vested in a German or an English frame, although\r\nprobabilities are in favour of the latter. Vitelleschi was there too,\r\nwith his Roman familiarity with men, forms, and projects. And there\r\nwas Lord Acton, the Roman Marchese, brother to a bishop, soon to be a\r\nCardinal; the English Baron nephew to a Cardinal. M. Frond would be\r\nin exceedingly great glory. M. Veuillot, frightened, _he says_, by\r\nthe rain, was in his rooms by the Piazza di Spagna, describing to the\r\n_Univers_ what he calls \"the moral of the ceremony\"--a fact which he\r\nstates long afterwards (i. p. 73). He acknowledges that he did not\r\nsmell the odour of the crowd; but not on that account is he to be told\r\nthat he did not see the first session. He went to the top of the Pincio\r\nabout noon, saw the dome and the Vatican wrapped in fog and rain, and\r\nthe sky laden as if with storms for all time. But he saw the Council\r\nas one ought to see it, and as history will see it; and never on the\r\nsunniest morning did the hill of Peter, the mountain where God dwells,\r\nappear more luminous to him.\r\n\r\nCorrespondents of the _Civiltá_ published on the spot, of the _Stimmen_\r\npublished on the Rhine, of distant journals in America and the East,\r\nwere revelling in the Catholicity and brilliancy of the spectacle,\r\nand preparing to transmit across the Alps and across the seas some\r\nvibration of the transports by which every now and then they were\r\nthemselves thrilled. The untonsured but inevitable correspondents of\r\nthe profane Press were there, odious in forms unknown.\r\n\r\nLiberal Catholics from different countries were there in numbers,\r\nstriving to hope against hope, now thinking of the courage of their\r\nnational bishops, now of the moderation of the Pontiff; and now\r\nexercising faith in the good stars of the Church, but trusting that,\r\nsomehow or other, credit to the Catholic cause would result from the\r\nCouncil, instead of Jesuit fighting, followed by disaster, which they\r\nhad too much ground to fear.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Jesuits were quietly exulting in the knowledge\r\nthat the days of the Liberal Catholics were numbered. \"Weighed and\r\nfound wanting\" were words often upon their lips at that time.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of the Protestants, of all classes, was chiefly that of\r\ncuriosity. Such of them as believed that Rome yet retained enough of\r\nthe Christian element to be capable of reform wished that the Jesuits\r\nmight fail. Those, on the other hand, who believed that at Trent Rome\r\nhad written upon herself the doom _irreformable_, thought that the\r\nonly thing now before her was to go down deeper into her own errors,\r\nand to make herself formally what she long had been virtually, the\r\nreligion simply of the _fait accompli_, a system in which each error\r\nonce committed must enter into the blood, and even form abnormal bone.\r\nPerhaps the words \"judicial blindness\" were never so often quietly\r\nuttered by charitable men as then, and during the months ensuing.\r\n\r\nThe tomb of Peter shared with his statue in the honours of the morn. In\r\nthe ray of its lamps knelt many a figure of \"fair women and brave men.\"\r\nThe men hoped to rise braver for the coming struggle. The words of the\r\nPontiff were vividly in the memories of the devout--words uttered to\r\nfive hundred bishops. \"We never doubted that a mysterious force and\r\nsalutary virtue emanated from the tomb where repose the ashes of Peter,\r\nas a perpetual object of religious veneration to the world; a force\r\nwhich inspires the pastors of the Lord's flock with bold enterprises,\r\nnoble spirit, and magnanimous sentiment.\"[203] Pius IX would hardly\r\nhave seen the force of an inquiry, should any one have dared to make\r\nit, whether there was any known case in which one of the Apostles had\r\nin Jerusalem sent even the most ignorant of Christians to the tomb of\r\nthe proto-martyr, ay, or to the tomb of tombs, in order there to seek\r\nsome blessing that could not be found by going into his own closet, and\r\npraying to his Father who seeth in secret.\r\n\r\nThe _Civiltá_, however, gave a more intelligent turn to this Papal\r\nsuggestion--\r\n\r\n    It is to be hoped (it said) that this Council, announced on the\r\n    centenary of St. Peter, convoked by a Bull dated on the day of St.\r\n    Peter, and assembled round the wonderful tomb of St. Peter, will\r\n    be _par excellence_ the Council of St. Peter. That means the most\r\n    obsequious to the prerogatives of Peter, whose divine authority,\r\n    the centre and foundation of all social authority, is at the same\r\n    time that which is most combated by the spirit of the world,\r\n    according to the words of the Saviour, \"The whole world lieth in\r\n    wickedness\" (1 John v. 19).\r\n\r\nWhile the people waited, the bishops were robing in the Julian\r\ncorridor, and the patriarchs in one of the adjoining apartments. Over\r\nthe grand portico of St. Peter's is a hall, well known on Holy Thursday\r\nas the place where the twelve apostles celebrate the Supper--the hall\r\nin which the five hundred presented their salutation in 1867. This\r\nhad been converted into a chapel, by the erection of an altar. Here\r\nassembled the members of the procession. Each prelate, on completing\r\nhis costume, made for the hall, but was not permitted to have any\r\nattendant. It being the Day of the Immaculate Conception, the colour\r\nof the vestments was white; a rule, however, which did not bind the\r\nOrientals. The cardinals were robing in a room apart. Each of them\r\nhaving done so, entered the hall followed by his train-bearer. Bishops,\r\nprelates, and cardinals waited while the Pope robed. This he did in\r\nthe Pauline Chapel, attended by three cardinals, two bishops, the\r\nsub-deacon apostolic, two protonotaries, and a few minor officials.\r\nThey adorned him with amice and with alb, with girdle and with stole.\r\nThen did the cardinal-priest in waiting bring the censer, and the Pope\r\nput the incense on. Then did they further array him in the \"formal,\"\r\nthe pluvial, and the precious mitre. At about half-past nine o'clock,\r\nPius IX, in all the glory of gems and garments, entered the hall,\r\nwhere between seven and eight hundred bishops stood before the altar,\r\nawaiting their royal head. He did not wear either the tiara or the\r\nusual golden mitre, but a special _precious mitre_ made for the\r\noccasion, \"This\" says, Vitelleschi (p. 3), \"was to indicate a certain\r\nequality with the other bishops, which, however, is confined to these\r\nlittle accessories of the ceremonial.\" The white pluvial was fastened\r\non his breast by an enamelled clasp, about which clerical writers are\r\nparticular. The clasp was set with jewels in the form of a dove, with\r\noutstretched wings, surrounded by a halo of rays, and _representing the\r\nHoly Ghost_. The Pope passed among the Fathers holding out his fingers,\r\nin the usual manner, on this side and on that, giving them what is\r\ngrotesquely called the _pontifical_ benediction. Then kneeling at the\r\nfaldstool he took off his mitre and prayed. Two cardinals, approaching\r\nthe kneeling Pontiff, placed a book before his eyes. He looked upon it,\r\nlifted up his aged but resounding voice, and sang--\r\n\r\n Creator Spirit, come!\r\n\r\nThis strain was taken up by the choir, and the first verse was sung,\r\nall kneeling. The Pontiff then rose, put on his mitre, and was seated\r\nin his portative throne.\r\n\r\nThe portative throne is a contrivance for exhibiting a dignitary to the\r\ngaze of a multitude, which does not remind one of anything to be seen\r\nelsewhere in Europe, but does strongly remind one of the way in which\r\na great Guru is carried in India. It is a gorgeous litter, on which is\r\nplaced a gorgeous chair, under a gorgeous canopy, called a Baldachino.\r\nIn the chair is seated the Pontiff. Men robed in crimson bear the\r\nlitter; others bear the canopy on long gilded decorated poles, and\r\nbeside it others bear gigantic fans of peacocks' feathers.\r\n\r\nEven in a secular procession, more serious than an election triumph,\r\nthis sort of chairing would be of doubtful taste; but in a religious\r\nact, above all an act done in the house of God, it would be impossible,\r\nexcept where the aesthetic of faith had expired, and the aesthetic of\r\nthought had long surrendered to the aesthetic of sensation. As the\r\nPontiff was set on high a shot fired from St. Angelo told the waiting\r\nmultitude that the procession was formed.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the clergy of the city lined the whole course of the\r\nprocession on either side. This extended from the door of the hall,\r\nthrough some of the apartments of the Vatican, down the celebrated\r\nRoyal Staircase, through the magnificent portico of St. Peter's, up\r\nthe nave to the statue of the Apostle, then to the altar at his grave,\r\nand finally, to the right of that altar, into the hall of the Council.\r\nAs the head of the procession emerged from the hall, the manifold\r\ncostumes of the clergy formed the skirting of the lofty walls, in the\r\napartments through which it slowly swept. The most noticeable of these\r\nwas the Royal Hall, _Sala Regia_, where frescoes, suggestive of more\r\nswords than one, appealed, by Papal memories, to Papal hopes. There\r\nwas Gregory VII giving absolution to the penitent emperor Henry IV.\r\nThere was the attack upon Tunis in 1553, there the massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew's, the League against the Turks, and Barbarosas receiving\r\nthe benediction of the Pope in the Piazza of St. Mark. From the Royal\r\nHall descends the Royal Staircase _Scala Regia_. All down its two\r\nflights the reverent clergy lined the way, as the \"Church Princes\"\r\nswept by. In the lower flight the Ionic capitals of the colonnade\r\ngracefully lengthened out the perspective, while the stately march\r\nof mitres glanced between the shafts. With a supreme sense of the\r\nimportance of the act did the train pass down the noble stair; each\r\nprelate no less sustaining the dignity of the moment because just then\r\nthe eye of the outer world beheld them not. In the view of a real\r\nVaticanist a great procession is a good in itself, and a very high\r\ngood, apart from its uses; or, perhaps more properly, it is felt that\r\nits effectiveness for use wholly depends upon the sense of discipline\r\nin its members.\r\n\r\nFinally the foot of the stair was reached. The portative throne passed\r\nthe statue of Constantine, the first who ever drew sword for the\r\nChurch. It swept round and faced the statue of Charlemagne, the first\r\nupon whose head the Church ever set imperial crown. Each stood at an\r\nend of the magnificent vista formed by the portico--grand watchers at\r\nthe door of the Pontiff, ever telling that the kings whom his Church\r\nwants are not merely nursing fathers but champions in fight. As the\r\nsight of their uplifted monarch burst upon the people, and that of the\r\npeople upon their king, the heavy guns from the Aventine were firing\r\nalternately with those of St. Angelo, while all the bells were trying\r\nto exceed the joypeal of the preceding day. Before his Holiness reached\r\nthis point, the procession had already entered the nave in slow and\r\ngorgeous order.\r\n\r\nIn front came chamberlains, chaplains, and officials of sixteen\r\nascending grades. After these came the Fathers of the Council,--first\r\nthe generals of orders, next mitred abbots, and then followed bishops,\r\narchbishops, primates, and patriarchs, in succession of still ascending\r\nrank, every man in appropriate splendour. The Orientals outshone their\r\nwestern brethren even more than usual; for the robes of the Latins,\r\nbeing confined to the white of the day, were at a disadvantage beside\r\nthe eastern coats of many colours. The Senator, as the incumbent\r\nis called of a quaint old office under the Papal government, which\r\nwe might call that of honorary mayor of Rome, marched between the\r\nprelates and the throne in golden robe of rich variety. He was\r\naccompanied by the conservators, whom we might call something like\r\nhonorary councilmen, and also by the commandants of the three orders\r\nof guards--the noble, the Palatine, and the Swiss. Finally, sitting\r\naloft, with the fans and the bearers, and the poles and the canopy,\r\ncame the Pontiff. The moving throne was followed by a lengthened rear\r\nprocession, formed of sundry officials, and closing with the priests,\r\nwho had for some time been practising shorthand, in order to act as\r\nreporters.\r\n\r\nThe faithful from east and west gazed with enraptured eyes. Many were\r\nproud to recognize their own bishops; some still prouder to see their\r\nown gifts in robe or gem shining among the adornments of the day. Any\r\nHindu present, looking at priest and soldier, might have exclaimed\r\nin the words of the _Bhagavad Gita_: \"Many a wondrous sight, many a\r\nheavenly ornament, many an upraised weapon; adorned with celestial\r\nrobes and chaplets; anointed with heavenly essence, covered with every\r\nmarvellous thing.\"[204]\r\n\r\nFrom early morn, \"_the holiest_,\" to use the term of one of the\r\npriestly descriptions, had been exhibited upon the altar; but out\r\nof tenderness to the throng had been veiled till the procession\r\napproached. As it entered the temple, every member of it uncovered\r\nto \"_the holiest_.\" Those who were not members of the Council,\r\nafter reaching the high altar, defiled to the left. The Fathers of\r\nthe Council approaching the altar, each in his turn bent the knee\r\nbefore the Host; and then turning to the right, beheld the front of\r\nthe Council Hall erected between two of the piers which sustain the\r\ngreat dome of Michael Angelo. Over the door was a picture, professing\r\nto represent the Eternal Father. The door was kept by the military\r\nfigures of the Knights of Malta and the noble guards. Each prelate,\r\nin turn, entered the hall, bowed to the cross erected upon the altar,\r\nand was shown to the place assigned to him, according to his rank\r\nand seniority; for care was taken that the bishops should not group\r\nthemselves either according to nation or according to opinion. There,\r\nstanding and bareheaded, they awaited the Holy Father (_Frond_, vii. p.\r\n98).\r\n\r\nAfter the procession had been for some time moving up the nave, a\r\nwhisper, \"The cross, the cross,\" passed from lip to lip. The cross was\r\nborne immediately in front of the Fathers of the Council. Priest told\r\npriest of its choice beauty and immense costliness. Designed in the\r\nGothic of the thirteenth century, and rich with gems, it represented\r\nChrist, not in His passion, but crowned, as conquering Lord, in glory.\r\nAmong the expressions of delight, the proudest was, \"It is a present to\r\nthe Pope from the English convert, the Marquis of Bute.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pope did not, on this occasion, as he usually does, pass up the\r\nwhole of the nave on his portative throne--a process which guide-books\r\ndescribe as representing the Lord of Glory entering Paradise. He now\r\nalighted at the entrance of the basilica, and, with deliberate step\r\nand thrice radiant smiles, his head alone mitred while all others were\r\nuncovered in presence of the \"holiest,\" he marched among soldiers,\r\npriests, and subjects, a sovereign _in excelsis_. Before him went his\r\nhundreds of lieutenants, in attire which would have dazzled ancient\r\nPontifex, Flamen, and Augur. Every one of them was prepared to contend\r\nwith princes in his cause, to set his name before that of their king,\r\nand to claim, in their respective countries, a supreme sway for his\r\nsceptre. Not a few of them had endured prosecution or prison to uphold\r\nhis law against that of their country, and no note of the lyres that\r\nsounded the praises of the day was sweeter than that which commemorated\r\nthe name of any martyr-bishop, hero of the kingdom of God, against the\r\nnaturalism of the age.\r\n\r\nThe Cardinals had not followed the bishops into the hall. They now\r\nstood near the high altar. Two bishops were at the faldstool, with book\r\nand candle. At the altar itself stood the officiating Cardinal, with\r\na priest, a deacon and sub-deacon, a master of the ceremonies, five\r\nacolytes bearing candles, and three clerks of the chapel. On arriving\r\nat the altar the Pontiff bowed upon the faldstool. Then the last\r\nstrophe of the _Veni Creator_ was exquisitely sung by the choir. To use\r\nthe words of a priest, written, not for Spaniards or Brazilians, but\r\nfor Germans: \"Every member of the historical procession cast himself\r\nupon his knees before our God and Saviour in the form of bread, before\r\nwhom all kings bow.\"[205]\r\n\r\nAfter the adoration of the Host the Pope, still kneeling, recited\r\naloud the prayer, \"Look upon us, O God our protector!\"--_Protector\r\nNoster Aspice Deus_--and for some time he continued reciting prayers\r\nin alternation with the choir. \"Rising up,\" says Monsignor Guérin, \"he\r\nrecited a prayer to the Holy Sacrament, another to the Holy Spirit, a\r\nthird to invoke the aid of the Holy Virgin and that of the Apostles St.\r\nPeter and St. Paul, a fourth to God\" (_Guérin_, p. 76).\r\n\r\nThe Cardinals, with their train-bearers, now turning to the right,\r\nentered the Hall of the Council, where the bishops had been waiting for\r\nsome time.\r\n\r\nAs the Pope advanced to the eventful enclosure, two former comrades\r\nin one lawyer's office held the corners of his pluvial--the Cardinals\r\nAntonelli and Mertel. If these ministers deserved half of the ill that\r\nwas said of them by the common voice of Rome, or even by a writer like\r\nLiverani, who shuns private scandal, and only treats of public acts,\r\nPius IX was not at that moment to be congratulated on the character of\r\nhis companions. Confiding in the patronage of her whom he had set on\r\nhigh, he once more passed among the ornate hundreds of his mighty but\r\ndocile servants. Approaching the altar he offered up a prayer; then\r\npassing to the throne at the far end of the Hall, he, in the words of\r\nSambin, \"dominated the whole assembly, and appeared like the teaching\r\nChrist\" (p. 55).\r\n\r\nThe German Jesuit who wrote for the _Stimmen_ said, \"The bloodless\r\noffering was being presented on the altar, and soon must the _invisible\r\nHead of the Church be present in form of bread_. Opposite sits His\r\nrepresentative upon a throne; below him, the Cardinals; around, the\r\nCatholic world, represented in its bishops\" (_Neue Folge_, vi. p. 162).\r\n\r\nThis localized presence, not yet actual, but to come at the word of the\r\npriest, was the same as that \"divine presence\" which Cardinal Manning,\r\nwhen leaving home, said many in the English Church were sighing for as\r\nhaving formerly been in their churches. The early Christians saw the\r\nmost sublime token of God's presence in that absence of any similitude\r\nwhich perplexed the heathen soldiery at Nicomedia, which, in India,\r\nfirst perplexes and then awes the Hindu, and which to spiritual\r\nworshippers says, in the deep tone of silence--\r\n\r\n Lo, God is here, let us adore!\r\n\r\nAt this point, rather more than twenty of the particulars set down\r\nin the program had been got through, but there were one hundred and\r\nforty-eight of them in all. It would be well worth while for any\r\nmerely philosophic politician to follow them one by one, marking the\r\ndirections by which every act, posture, and prayer, whether audible or\r\nsilent, was prescribed. The science of government by spectacle really\r\ndeserves study by men of sense, because the practice of it is so mighty\r\nwith all who take an impression for a reason. The program is in the\r\n_Acta_, and those who choose to read it will find a prescription for\r\neach minutest move.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Iconium, whose real office was that of Vicar of\r\nSt. Peter's, approached the throne, holding his mitre in his hands;\r\nhe made a profound obeisance, then drawing near, he kissed the\r\nPope's knee. After this, mounting the pulpit, he preached, in cope\r\nand mitre, a sermon unlike that of Father Bianchi. It was long and\r\ntame, and hardly had the true Infallibilist ring. He felt that they\r\nwere entering upon an untried and thorny path. \"Tribulation,\" he\r\nsaid, \"will arise, bitter days and innumerable sorrows\" (_Acta_, pp.\r\n204-214). After the sermon the Pope rose and gave the benediction,\r\nduring which the cardinals and bishops stood, the abbots and generals\r\nof orders kneeling down. \"It is,\" says Monsignor Guérin, \"the Moses\r\nof the new law, with his shining brow.\" He then offered up a prayer,\r\nwith invocation of the Church triumphant and of all saints, \"the\r\nformidable army which is drawn up around the Pope and the Council,\r\nand which assures victory to the Church,\" as Guérin expounds it. The\r\npreacher then published the indulgences from the pulpit. Now came\r\nan interlude preparatory to a transaction of grave importance. To\r\nprescribe the action of the interlude, it required all the articles\r\nof the program from thirty-seven to fifty. To perform that action\r\ntook up in a Christian place of worship probably a full half-hour of\r\nthe time of seven hundred bishops, of several thousand clergymen, of\r\nKnights of Malta, of noble guards, Palatine guards, Swiss guards, of\r\nsome two thousand soldiers, and of probably twenty thousand people.\r\nTwo bishops, with book and candle, draw near to the throne. The\r\nPontiff recites _Quam dilecta_, etc. The sub-deacon apostolic, who is\r\na judge of the high court of the Rota, called the Supreme Tribunal of\r\nthe whole Christian world, advances. He is accompanied by two judges\r\nof the high court of the Signet, to which even the Rota, in spite of\r\nits title, is subordinate.[206] The three judges solemnly bear to the\r\nthrone in a scarf of silver cloth the apostolic stockings and slippers\r\ntrimmed with gold lace. The Pontiff puts on stockings and slippers.\r\nMonsignor the Sacristan takes his place at the altar ready to give out\r\nthe robes. The two judges of the high court of the Signet stand at the\r\naltar ready to take the robes from Monsignor the Sacristan, and to\r\nhand them to the cardinal deacon. Then the cardinal deacon approaches\r\nthe throne. The senior cardinal priest ascends the steps of the throne\r\nand takes the ring from off the Pontiff. The judges of the high court\r\nof the Signet bring the robes to the throne. Then the senior cardinal\r\npriest, assisted by the cardinal deacons, takes off from the Pontiff\r\nthe mitre, takes off the formal, the pluvial, the stole and the girdle;\r\nafter which he puts on the cord, the pectoral cross, the fanon, the\r\nstole, the tunic, the dalmatic, the gloves, and the white chasuble\r\nwrought with gold. The sub-deacon apostolic now bears the pallium to\r\nthe throne, and one of the judges of the high court of the Signet\r\naccompanies him, bearing the pins. The cardinal deacon then puts upon\r\nthe Pontiff the sacred pallium, takes the mitre and replaces it on the\r\nPontiff. Finally, the senior cardinal priest again ascends the steps\r\nof the throne and puts on the ring which he had before taken off. And\r\nseven hundred bishops, and several thousand priests, and a couple of\r\nthousand soldiers, and some twenty thousand people, all were agreed\r\nthat this was imposing, impressive, divine.\r\n\r\nThis public toilet was in preparation for what Cecconi calls \"the\r\nsublime and moving rite called the Obedience\"; the homage of the\r\nvassals to the ruler of the world. First the Cardinals one by one\r\narose, slowly approached the throne, performed an obeisance, and kissed\r\nthe hand of the sovereign. Then patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops,\r\napproaching in their turn, made low reverences before the steps of the\r\nthrone, and, slowly drawing nigh, kissed the Pope's right knee. Abbots\r\nand generals of orders knelt before reaching the steps of the throne,\r\nrose, drew nigh, knelt again, and kissed the king's right foot. For an\r\nhour and a quarter this act of homage was continued. From the banks of\r\nthe Thames and of the Seine, of the Ganges and the Hudson; from the\r\nAlps and the Andes; from historic lands of Asia, whence the light of\r\nhistory had long faded; from emerging countries in the New World, on\r\nwhich its first beams were beginning to strike--came forward lordly\r\nfigures of men accustomed to command, and sometimes to domineer. Each,\r\nwith chosen and awe-struck movement, drew near to the king of his heart\r\nand conscience, and rendered up his homage, like gold and frankincense\r\nand myrrh.\r\n\r\nVitelleschi, in a vein generally Roman, alluding to these \"five\r\nquarters of an hour\" spent in bowing, kneeling, and kissing; says,\r\n\"What strength of memory is necessary for him who being humbly entitled\r\nthe Servant of the Servants of God, had to keep that modest formula in\r\nmind during the whole ceremony!\" But if the scene at this particular\r\npoint might tax the memory of the Pope, it would surely cheer the hopes\r\nof those \"august minds\" that, having adapted their code to the views of\r\nconfessors, were now idle spectators of the Council, while other kings\r\nwere on their thrones. The ex-sovereigns of Naples, Tuscany, and Parma,\r\nlooking on that display of widely-extended power, and viewing through\r\nthe stained windows of a Catholic imagination the political forces\r\nrepresented by it, might be both excused and commiserated if they saw\r\nsigns of happy days returning.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits said, \"Surely those non-Catholics who witnessed this action\r\nmust have perceived that Catholicity, like unity, is found only where\r\nChrist lives, speaks, and reigns--in Peter; that is, in the Roman\r\nChurch, of which Pius IX is now Peter.\" But we may quietly ask, Could\r\neven those writers fancy Peter, at the only Apostolic Council, seated\r\nupon a throne somewhere on Mount Zion, while John, James, and Paul\r\ncame up in the presence of the assembled Church and kissed his knee,\r\nand Philip, Barnabas, and others knelt and kissed his foot? Far as the\r\naesthetics of those Jesuits had descended, by a long materializing\r\nprocess, they must surely have read enough of the Holy Scriptures to\r\nfeel that the scene enacted in St. Peter's, though a fine edition of\r\na Durbar, was a sad fall from an Apostolic Council. You promise the\r\npupils of Plato a higher wisdom than they ever knew in the Academy, and\r\nthey find for wisdom the gewgaws of Freemasons. Such a scene was bad\r\nin manners, bad in politics, and bad in religion. In manners, it tended\r\nto make men servile in a lower position and arrogant in a higher; in\r\npolitics, it tended to make them either slaves or despots; in religion,\r\nit tended to make them either unbelieving or superstitious. Is it part\r\nof the penalty of Rome that barbaric forms should linger at its Court,\r\nwhen the spirit of Christianity has banished them from the Courts of\r\nChristian kings? Our own monarch, at the head of her two hundred and\r\neighty millions, is too good a Christian to make her subject Rajahs,\r\nas a spectacle for her commons and her troops, come and fall down and\r\nkiss her foot. The words which commanded the followers of Christ not\r\nto exercise over one another the kind of lordship which the kings of\r\nthe Gentiles exercised over them were, with pompous action, publicly\r\ntrampled upon in this scene of \"the obedience,\" and that both in the\r\nspirit and in the letter. He who complacently sat and acted out that\r\nscene in the house of God for an hour and a quarter, might better claim\r\nto represent many known in the history of ambition, than the lowly Lord\r\nof Peter.\r\n\r\nUp to this time only sixty-seven articles of the program had been\r\nperformed. Thirty more were exhausted by postures, manipulations,\r\nand devotions. The officiating cardinal-priest then came forward,\r\nbearing the reeking censer. He waved it before the enthroned priest,\r\naround whom swelled up the clouds till subject eyes looked up to him\r\nthrough a sacred haze, and till he looked down on his subject creatures\r\nfrom a sky of fragrant mist. This ceremony fulfilled, all took their\r\nseats with their mitres on, and the Pontiff, rising, delivered his\r\nallocution. It overflowed with joy and hope. It clearly pointed out\r\nthe enemy to be destroyed. \"A conspiracy of the wicked, mighty by\r\ncombination, rich in resources, fortified with institutions, and using\r\nliberty for a cloak of maliciousness.\" Obviously this enemy was not a\r\ntheological but a political one. Vitelleschi, who naturally heard with\r\nItalian ears, says that the language, though _using a cloak_, was plain\r\nenough to show what enemy was meant.\r\n\r\nAs the Pontiff drew to the close of his allocution, he, with a burst\r\nof feeling, put up two invocations, one to the Holy Spirit, the\r\nother to the Blessed Virgin. After this, with contagious intensity\r\nof emotion, he threw up both hands to heaven. At a bound, the whole\r\nassembly stood up. Then he poured forth the final invocation with the\r\nfullest resonance of his wonderful tones--tones which might have served\r\nin chanting from Gerizim to Ebal. He invoked angels and archangels,\r\nPeter, Paul, and all the saints, more particularly those whose ashes\r\nwere venerated on that spot. This speech from the apostolic throne,\r\nexclaims Monsignor Guérin, beginning with the liveliest joy, afterwards\r\nexpressing divine agonies, concluded with firm and tranquil confidence!\r\n\r\nNow followed another round of ceremonies, at the close of which the\r\nmaster of the ceremonies proclaimed, \"Let those who are not members of\r\nthe Council withdraw.\" The royal and noble spectators left the scene;\r\nthe doors were closed. The Knights of Malta and the noble guard stood\r\nsentry between the faithful, who were to receive the creed as it might\r\nbe shaped, and the Fathers, who were to decide for them what their\r\ncreed should be. What would take place before those doors should be\r\nopened again? Persistent rumour had said that the extreme party meant\r\nto attempt an acclamation. Therefore many believed it possible that in\r\none brief sitting the basis of infallibility might be shifted from that\r\nof an infallible Church to that of an infallible man.\r\n\r\nOther rumours asserted that some French prelates had let it be known\r\nthat if any attempt at getting up an acclamation should be made,\r\nthey would leave the Council. But what might take place behind those\r\ncharmed walls, who could tell? All that could be said with certainty\r\nwas that now, for the first time in the history of man, one hundred\r\nand seventy millions, perhaps two hundred millions, were standing idle\r\nspectators of the process of altering their creed. They had not a\r\nsingle representative; not one channel of expression, not one possible\r\nresort in appeal. What used to be a general council was now a conclave;\r\nsitting behind a guard of armed men. King and priest, councillor of\r\nstate and doctor of divinity, were equally shut out. The Catholic\r\nmultitude appeared indifferent. The few who were not indifferent were\r\npowerless. They had all been parties to narrowing the idea of the\r\nChurch to that of the clergy. That idea was now, without the consent of\r\nany one being asked, formally narrowed from that of the clergy to that\r\nof the bishops and Court prelates. It might further be narrowed from\r\nthat of the Episcopate to that of the Pope. It appears to us not very\r\neasy to call men fanatics who have done so much with mankind, when they\r\npropose and expect to do still more!\r\n\r\nThe point at which we now stand in the program of the day is the 109th\r\nArticle, which is the first of several prescribing a ceremony with\r\na substance. Bishop Fessler, Secretary of the Council, and Bishop\r\nValenziani of Fabriano, approached the throne. The Secretary handed a\r\ndocument to the Pontiff. The Pope handed the document to Valenziani,\r\nwho thereupon, ascending the pulpit, turned towards the throne, made a\r\nprofound obeisance, took off his mitre, and read out as follows--\"Pius,\r\nthe Bishop-Servant of the Servants of God, with the approbation of the\r\nHoly Council.\" Having now pronounced the title of the decree, he again\r\nput on his mitre, seated himself, and proceeded to read the substance\r\nof the Decree. This consisted of one sentence, declaring the Council\r\nopened. In that ill-constructed hall few heard what was read; and many\r\nwere wicked enough to hint that, if ill-constructed, the hall was not\r\nill-contrived. Once more laying aside the mitre, Bishop Valenziani rose\r\nand asked, \"Is the Decree now read agreed to?\" The bishops were seated\r\nin their mitres, the abbots standing bareheaded. There was no formal\r\nvote. Those who understood what was said, cried _Placet_, and others\r\nrepeated the cry. No one dissented. This result was communicated to the\r\nsovereign, and he from the throne proclaimed--\"The Decree now read is\r\nagreed to by the Fathers, none dissenting; and we decree, enact, and\r\nsanction it, as read.\"\r\n\r\nThese forms were exactly repeated, and a second Decree was passed.\r\nLike the first, it consisted of a single sentence, which fixed the\r\nnext public session for January 6. The two Promoters of the Council,\r\nas they were called, now advancing, first knelt on the lowest step of\r\nthe throne, and then addressed the notaries, saying, \"We pray you,\r\nProtonotaries here present, to draw up an authentic document, recording\r\nall and singular the acts done in this public session of the all-holy\r\nOEcumenical Vatican Council.\" The senior protonotary then appealing to\r\nthe Majordomo and the High Chamberlain, who stood on the right hand of\r\nthe throne, said, \"We shall draw it up, ye being witnesses\" (_Frond_,\r\nvii. p. 119).\r\n\r\nThe constitutional crisis had come and gone, and very few were aware\r\nof it. Those who had thought of the program as anything more than\r\nthe order of a pageant, must have observed that the signification of\r\nthose acts amounted to no less than putting aside the conciliar form\r\nof Decree, and adopting in its stead that of the Papal Bulls. We have\r\nalready seen that Friedrich, as a Church historian, saw this at a\r\nglance. It need not be said that the ancient Councils, representing\r\nthe whole Church, spoke in their own name, themselves _decreeing_\r\nand _enacting_. As to the only Council \"over\" which Pontiff Peter I\r\n\"presided,\" it would not do to cite it as an example.[207] As late as\r\nTrent, every Decree bore upon the face of it the words, \"_This holy\r\nCouncil enacts and decrees_.\" All the statutes of the Council of Trent,\r\nwithout alteration of a word, were immediately confirmed by the Pope,\r\nhe having beforehand promised, in writing, to do so. The formula then\r\nused was, of course, liable to the interpretation that it indicated the\r\nsuperiority of the Council to the Pope. That interpretation had been\r\nactually put upon it by schools in the Church, at one time, including\r\nwhole nations.\r\n\r\nThe Decrees now passed had never been before the Council for\r\ndeliberation, but were handed from the throne ready made. The Pope,\r\naccording to the formula, did not merely sanction, but _decreed_,\r\n_enacted_, and _sanctioned_--that is, he took the part of both\r\nparliament and crown.\r\n\r\nThe Council is only mentioned as \"approving\" of this absorption of\r\nits own powers into those of its head. The part thus allowed to this\r\nso-called OEcumenical Council, this Senate of Humanity, in framing\r\nDecrees, is less than the part allowed to the College of Cardinals in\r\nthe framing of Bulls. Take, for instance, the Bull of Convocation. It\r\nexpressly says that, in issuing it, the Pope acts not only with the\r\nconsent of the Cardinals, but by their counsel.\r\n\r\nThis expresses more than \"with the approbation.\" All, therefore, that\r\nthe collective episcopate did for the College of Cardinals was somewhat\r\nto curtail its relative legislative importance. Alone, both its counsel\r\nand consent were recognized. When united with all the bishops, only\r\nits consent. This looked like telling the bishops that their counsel\r\nwas superfluous. In the Bull history conquered dogma. The counsel and\r\nconsent of the Cardinals was the memento of the historical fact that\r\nthe Bishop of Rome originally spoke with authority only when he spoke\r\nas the mouthpiece of the local clergy. In the Decree dogma conquered\r\nhistory. The Bishop of Rome alone was to appear as speaking with\r\nauthority, and all other bishops were to appear only as approving,\r\nbut neither as counselling nor confirming; as for the clergy, they\r\nwere no longer of the Teaching Church. The substance of the Decrees\r\npassed was perfectly innocent. They had, moreover, the advantage of\r\nexactly copying the acts done in the first session at Trent, while\r\ndestroying the forms there employed. In the _Acta_ of that Council two\r\nresolutions, declaring the Council opened, and fixing the day for the\r\nsecond public session, were entered as constituent acts, before the\r\nheading given to Decrees of the constituted body began to be used. The\r\ntwo constituent resolutions were not even headed by the name of the\r\nCouncil, while the name of the Pope does not occur in the heading of\r\nany of the Decrees, much less does it stand as the sole legislative\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nAt Trent it was not a private member of the Council, like Bishop\r\nValenziani, but the first presiding legate, Cardinal De Monte, who read\r\nout the draft of a resolution, in the form of a question declaring\r\nthe Council opened. To this question the Fathers \"all with one consent\r\nanswered, _Placet_.\" The second resolution was put in the same form.\r\nBoth, as we have intimated, were entered without the heading of\r\nDecrees, and stand as the acts of a body organizing itself, but not as\r\nlegislative acts of that body when organized. Every subsequent Decree\r\nis a real legislative act, and therefore bears the formal heading, \"The\r\nAll-Holy Council of Trent, in the Holy Ghost lawfully assembled ...\r\nordains and decrees.\"[208]\r\n\r\nThe formula adopted in the Vatican Council had the advantage of\r\ndetermining, once for all, what that Council was to be, namely,\r\na secret consistory of bishops, to give an approval to Papal\r\nConstitutions. Its Presidents were Cardinals, an office unknown to the\r\nChristian Church--princes simply of the Court of Rome, though most\r\nof them bear the orders of priest. Of the members of the Council a\r\nvast number, though called bishops, were really no more than mitred\r\nequerries and chamberlains. In the means it took to deprive the\r\ndiocesan bishops of their inherited powers in Council, the Curia knew\r\nits men. Brought up in the sentiment that an effective \"function\" is\r\nthe sublimest stroke of civil or ecclesiastical government, it would\r\nhave been a revolt against all their instincts to disturb a pageant\r\nso unrivalled as the one in which they that day had the felicity of\r\nbearing a part. The Curia placed them in this dilemma: Either they\r\nmust rise up amidst that blaze of splendour and resist the act of the\r\nsovereign at whose feet they had just bowed, or they must learn at a\r\nlater stage, if they should then challenge the Rules of Procedure,\r\nthat the moment for objection was past. The success of the Curia was\r\ncomplete. The general drew out his men for a review, and turned the\r\nThermopylæ of the opposition without having ever seen a Spartan. Those\r\nwho had come up resolved to oppose changes in their creed soon found\r\nthat the one pass that might have been held against overwhelming odds\r\nwas already in the enemy's rear. The Nine had not spent nearly ten\r\nmonths on the Rules of Procedure for nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen this brief episode in the drama of the day had passed over, the\r\ndoors were thrown open, and the spectators who had been excluded\r\nresumed their places. Many of the priests outside would feel\r\ndisappointed that they had not heard the hall resound with the voices\r\nof an acclamation. That would have told that Papal infallibility was\r\nadopted without discussion. Friedrich lets it appear that he felt\r\nrelieved at the opening of the doors before there had been any exulting\r\nsound, and doubtless many shared his feeling.\r\n\r\nRumours, persistently kept up, declared that Archbishop Manning\r\nwould propose the dogma, and that the majority, breaking out into\r\nacclamation, would bear down all opposition. If such a design was ever\r\nentertained, it had been thought--some say it had been found--that\r\nit would prove wiser not to proceed so hastily. The passing of two\r\nDecrees in the form of Papal Constitutions was enough to carry \"the\r\nforms of the house,\" while the issuing of the Rules of Procedure as a\r\nBull, before the Council was opened, had taken away every pretext for\r\nalleging that they were open to revision by the Council itself, as\r\nbeing its own acts.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Manning, on his return to England, in a pastoral, treated\r\nthe rumour of an intended acclamation as if it was only laughable.\r\nA reason which he assigns for this is that Rome had had enough of\r\nacclamations, seeing that many who acclaimed infallibility in 1867 had\r\nopenly turned against it. The rumours, however, were too consistent,\r\nand too well supported by the hints of the _Civiltá_ and by the plain\r\nwords of Monsignor Plantier and others, to be prudently dismissed\r\nwith a smile--at least, anywhere but in England. They were not what\r\nDr. Manning represents them, rumours of an acclamation without a\r\ndefinition, but of a definition carried by acclamation, as in the case\r\nof the Immaculate Conception. On the other hand, Archbishop Manning's\r\nthrust at those who had in 1867 signed language that might seem to mean\r\neverything included in infallibility, without themselves intending to\r\nexpress that doctrine, is natural in one who had not wholly unlearned\r\nthe Protestant worth of words. Nevertheless, of all grounds on which\r\nthe prefects of the Pope should begin to trip one another up, the\r\nground to be selected by preference is scarcely that of finesse in the\r\ninterpretations they put on what they say. As to the part assigned to\r\nDr. Manning personally, it is possible that the rumour represented no\r\nmore than the fact that both they who hoped for an acclamation, and\r\nthey who feared it, mentioned the name which occurred to them as that\r\nof the most likely instrument of such a procedure, and both happened to\r\npronounce the same name. As if to justify this instinctive selection of\r\nboth parties, Dr. Manning, on his return home, said that if the Council\r\n\"had defined the infallibility at its outset, it would not have been an\r\nhour too soon; and perhaps it would have averted many a scandal we now\r\ndeplore.\"[209]\r\n\r\nA Roman noble thus notes the zeal of Dr. Manning--\r\n\r\n    No one is so devoted as a convert. Having himself erred for half\r\n    his lifetime did not restrain him from becoming the most ardent\r\n    champion of infallibility. This circumstance raised a presumption\r\n    of a deficiency, on his part, in that traditional ecclesiastical\r\n    spirit which is never fully acquired but by being early grounded\r\n    and by long continued usage--a presumption which was justified by\r\n    his excessive and intemperate restlessness. This seemed a cause\r\n    sufficient to lessen his authority with the Conservative portion\r\n    of the ecclesiastical world, which judges with more calmness and\r\n    serenity.[210]--(_Vitelleschi_, p. 35.)\r\n\r\nThe real work of the day was now done. It was time to sing the _Te\r\nDeum_. The Pontiff sounded the first note, and was followed by the\r\nFathers of the Council, by the choir, by the thousands outside in the\r\nBasilica. The strain was caught up in nave and aisles, in every chapel\r\nand every gallery; it mounted aloft into vaults and dome, till all who\r\nwere beneath the gorgeous roof thrilled under that returning swell of\r\nexulting sound; and many felt as if the world was falling, overwhelmed\r\nwith harmony, at the feet of Pio Nono.\r\n\r\nThe eighteen articles of the program still remaining contained little\r\nbeyond unrobing, re-robing, and dissolving.\r\n\r\nThe people had been for seven hours in the Cathedral. It still\r\nrained in torrents. The clerical organs said the providential\r\nrain had prevented mobs in different places from making hostile\r\ndemonstrations. During the time spent in the Cathedral, the people had\r\nnot heard--except so far as some of them could make out the Latin--a\r\nsentence of the Word of God or of the words of man. The seven hours\r\nof the twenty thousand had been spent in an intermitting gaze. All\r\nwent away, not only praising the pageant of the day, but extolling\r\nit. Friedrich quotes a diplomatist who said it was \"superb.\" The\r\ncorrespondent of the _Times_ said: \"It has been my fortune to see many\r\npageants in Rome, but none of them equalled, in majestic solemnity, the\r\nscene presented by the procession of bishops from all countries in the\r\nworld.\"[211] Monsignor Guérin cried: \"It offered the most majestic and\r\nenchanting spectacle which it was ever given to mortals to behold here\r\nbelow.\" M. Veuillot said that bishops were there from the rising to the\r\nsetting of the sun--men who would invade regions as yet closed against\r\nthem--the light-bearers and the God-bearers.[212] These old men, he\r\nadded, would overthrow darkness and death, and the day would break\r\n(vol. i. p. 12). Vitelleschi remarked that there was indeed a bishop\r\nfrom Chaldea and one from Chicago, but the former did not represent a\r\nCatholic Chaldea, nor the latter a Catholic Chicago. Even, he added, in\r\ncountries called Catholic, what proportion of the population are really\r\nof their flocks? He might have further added, And if their teaching\r\nis true, what proportion of their flocks are really Catholics?--for\r\nthey teach that a doubt on any single article of faith propounded by\r\ntheir Church, or a doubt on one of her interpretations of a text of\r\nScripture, taints one with heresy. How many Italians were, on the day\r\nof the opening of the Council, free from that taint?\r\n\r\nWe are reminded of an Englishman whose name, when he was only thirty\r\nyears of age, gained for him distinguished attention at the Vatican.\r\nHis Protestantism was much influenced by his early study of the\r\ncorruptions of Christianity at the centre of them. Had John Milton\r\nwitnessed that pageant we know exactly what he would have said. First\r\nhe would have shown that when the filial spirit of Christianity had\r\nbeen lost, the servile spirit of Paganism supervened. When men ceased\r\nto come to God as children to a father, they sought circuitous access\r\nthrough upper servants. Then followed what he describes in a sentence\r\nwith a strong flavour of the Phædrus--\r\n\r\n    They began to draw down all the divine intercourse betwixt God and\r\n    the soul, yea, the very shape of God Himself, into an exterior and\r\n    bodily form, urgently pretending a necessity and obligement of\r\n    joining the body in a formal reverence, and worship circumscribed;\r\n    they hallowed it, they fumed it, they sprinkled it, they bedecked\r\n    it, not in robes of pure innocency, but of pure linen, with other\r\n    deformed and fantastic dresses, in palls and mitres, gold and\r\n    gewgaws fetched from Aaron's old wardrobe, or the flamin's vestry:\r\n    then was the priest set to con his motions and his postures,\r\n    his liturgies and his lurries, till the soul, by this means\r\n    of over-bodying herself, given up justly to fleshly delights,\r\n    bated her wing apace downward: and finding the ease she had from\r\n    her visible and sensuous colleague the body, in performance of\r\n    religious duties, her pinions now broken and flagging, shifted\r\n    off from herself the labour of high soaring any more, forgot her\r\n    heavenly flight, and left the dull and droiling carcase to plod on\r\n    in the old road, and drudging trade of outward conformity.... They\r\n    knew not how to hide their slavish approach to God's behests, by\r\n    them not understood, nor worthily received, but by cloaking their\r\n    servile crouching to all religious presentments, sometimes lawful,\r\n    sometimes idolatrous, under the name of humility, and terming the\r\n    piebald frippery and ostentation of ceremonies, decency.--_Of\r\n    Reformation in England, first book._\r\n\r\nA writer in the _Stimmen_ thought that if those who were separated from\r\nthe Church had only been present they might have been won back. It\r\nwould be an easy way to settle the merits of a religion, if it could be\r\ndone by the simple experiment of what body had the grandest building\r\nfor a display, or the greatest number of richly dressed men to perform.\r\nWe do not presume to say whether Peter ever did visit Rome or not;\r\nbut, supposing that he did, the question between him and the sovereign\r\nPontiff of the day, as to the value of their respective religions,\r\nwould soon have been settled in favour of Nero, if it had gone by\r\nbuildings, statues, robes, and retinues. Probably the poor itinerant\r\npreacher was so conscious that, as Milton would say, his religion \"to\r\nthe gorgeous solemnities of paganism, and the sense of the world's\r\nchildren, seemed but a homely and yeomanly religion,\" that he would not\r\nhave challenged comparison with the purpled Pontiff on that ground. Any\r\nwriter who could imagine that the tendency of a \"function\" performed in\r\nthe manner of the one we have described is to convince Protestants that\r\nthe Church of Rome has in her forms much likeness left to the Church\r\nof Christ, must be unaware of the first elements of a comparison. When\r\nwe search the Scriptures daily to see whether these things are so, the\r\nestrangement of the Papacy from the Christianity of Christ, and its\r\naffinity to the Romanism of the Pagan Pontiffs, become more and more\r\nimpressive.\r\n\r\nThe feeling in St. Peter's did not permit guards to be dispensed with.\r\nIt transpired that extreme precaution had been taken to prevent the\r\nBasilica from being blown up. At the time, the general impression\r\nappeared to be that some of the National party had played upon the\r\nfears of the priests, hoaxing them with hints of such a design. But\r\nafter what occurred in Paris during the reign of the Commune, one can\r\nhardly think it impossible that some of the violent and ignorant may\r\nhave entertained wild plans. In 1867, a startling example of what might\r\nbe done had been shown in the blowing up of a barrack of the zouaves.\r\nWhen populations which have long been governed by spectacle, set out\r\nfor a political sensation, they sometimes go dreadful lengths to find a\r\nstirring one.\r\n\r\nThe city was to have been grandly illuminated, but the drenching rain\r\nwould have mocked all effort to keep in the tender life of the lamps.\r\nLet us hope, said the clerical writers, that the blue sky of Rome will\r\nsmile on the close of the Council, and that then the eternal city will\r\nglow brighter even than Ephesus in 431 (_Stimmen_, N.F., p. 166).\r\n\r\nIn addition to human helps to faith, it was announced that divine\r\nhelps had been vouchsafed. On this ever-memorable day the bones of the\r\nmartyrs at Concordia had distilled water, which in that part of Venetia\r\nwas a recognized presage of a joyful future. This is announced in the\r\norgan of that Court which was soberly undertaking to inaugurate a new\r\nera for all the societies of men (_Civiltá_, VII. ix. 104).\r\n\r\nThe same periodical in the very next sentence gave samples of\r\n_fanatical_ English Protestants. Citing the _Pall Mall Gazette_, it\r\ntold how a series of meetings had been held in Freemasons' Hall, at the\r\nsuggestion of Dr. Merle d'Aubigné, to pray for the Council. It went on\r\nto say that the Chairman, Mr. Arthur Kinnaird, had told how similar\r\nmeetings for prayer were to be held all over the world, and even among\r\nthe Protestants of Italy. It quoted two of the petitions said to have\r\nbeen offered up. Canon Auriol prayed _that all the machinations of Rome\r\nmight be turned to confusion_, and Dr. Cumming that the _day of her\r\nimagined triumph might prove to be that of her prophesied ruin_.\r\n\r\nIt was much pleasanter work to tell of the Anti-Council of the\r\nFreethinkers at Naples. Praying Protestants are to be hated and\r\nextinguished. But vaunting infidels are to the Jesuits what fires\r\nare to insurance offices--their apparent foes, but their only real\r\nsupports. That assembly spent a couple of days in vague and sometimes\r\nvast talk. It abused the Pope, and the Jesuits say it blasphemed God.\r\nIt proposed to find a code of morals without religion, those flowers\r\nwithout any stems which are the holy grail of such knights errant.\r\nFinally, it attacked the French Emperor and the Italian monarchy, and\r\nwas dissolved by the police. Demonstrations of a somewhat similar\r\nkind were attempted in a few other cities of Italy. In France, on\r\nthe contrary, the following cities were illuminated, and were\r\nlauded not only in their local clerical journals, but in the great\r\n_Civiltá_: Lyons, Bordeaux, Marseilles, Toulouse, Limoges, Clermont,\r\nSaint-Etienne, Laval, Moulins, Nismes, Auch, \"and others.\" Even in\r\nParis many convents illuminated their facades. (_Guérin_, p. 78.)\r\n\r\nAt Vienna a meeting of the nobility, gentry, clergy, and officials\r\ncomposing the Catholic Societies, and numbering, it is said, four\r\nthousand, was held to celebrate the day. The only Italian city\r\nspecified as having made any favourable demonstration was Brescia;\r\nand the account amounted to no more than that of an attendance of\r\nsome Society of young men at Mass, and of the sending of a promise of\r\nadhesion to the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: _Frond_, iii., p. 254.

On the Friday, however, they had again to meet\r\nfor the first General Congregation, or deliberative sitting. This\r\nwas presided over by the Cardinals appointed, whereas the Pope\r\nin person presided over the Public Sessions, or solemnities, for\r\nformally promulging Decrees. Cardinal De Reisach, Chief President,\r\nwas not in his chair, but upon his death-bed. As we have seen, he had\r\nsuperintended the drawing up (it is believed that with his own hand he\r\nhad drawn up) the first code of laws to regulate the relations of the\r\nChurch to civil society; but his code has never met the public eye.\r\n\r\nFrom this first General Congregation, writes Friedrich, even the\r\ntheologians were shut out.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of the day for nearly eight hundred bishops was to elect\r\ntwo committees of five each: one to examine applications for leave of\r\nabsence; and the other to settle contests as to precedence, and similar\r\nmatters, which contests at Trent often proved to be serious, indeed\r\nere now the streets of Rome have witnessed bloodshed arising out of\r\ndisputes of this sort between bishops. The members of these committees\r\nwere called respectively Judges of Excuses and Judges of Complaints and\r\nDisputes. The mode of election was simple; every one wrote five names\r\non a card. It proved that Fallibilists must not expect the smallest\r\nshare of office. Cardinal De Luca took the chief place, and opened\r\nthe Congregation with a few simple sentences. These were translated\r\nby interpreters for the Orientals who did not understand Latin. The\r\nprelate who on this occasion celebrated Mass at the opening of the\r\nsitting was the Bishop of Osimo, afterwards Cardinal Vitelleschi, to\r\nwhom some have ascribed the authorship of the work of his brother,\r\nwhich we often quote.[213]\r\n\r\nThe real business of the day, too important to be left to the\r\nepiscopate, had been done without them. It consisted in appointing the\r\nCommission of Proposals. Twelve Cardinals, twelve archbishops, and two\r\nbishops were announced as the men whom the Pontiff had put in charge\r\nof the rights of their brethren. Prelates with titles from Antioch,\r\nJerusalem, Thessalonica, and Sardis; one from Chili and one from\r\nBaltimore; one from Spain, one from Westminster, two Italians, and a\r\nfew others, were empowered to say whether the men who ruled the sees\r\nof Paris, Lyons, Munich, Cologne, and Milan, and those of Hungary and\r\nPortugal, were or were not to be recommended to the Pope for permission\r\nto bring forward any proposal. The Commission could not grant them\r\nleave to do so, but it could report to the Pontiff, who alone could\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nAs some seven hundred and fifty bishops found all their hopes of\r\nproposing anything placed at the discretion of these twenty-six men,\r\nit was not for them to reason why: it was for them simply to read in\r\nthe names now announced the record of past services and the fate of\r\nfuture suggestions.[214] They had not stayed the proceedings when they\r\nfound that the Pro-synodal Congregation had been used to fasten upon\r\nthem an edict which took away their right of self-organization, and it\r\nwas now hopeless to attempt to recover that right. The three youngest\r\narchbishops on the list were Giannelli, Manning, and Deschamps; the\r\nsecretary of the Nine, and the two hottest Infallibilists--all three\r\non the way to the purple, which they have since received at one and the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\nBut the sensation of the day, perhaps brought about at this moment\r\nto divert attention from the painful inroad just made upon episcopal\r\nrights, was a Bull determining the course to be taken should the death\r\nof the Pontiff occur during the Council. This edict determined that\r\nthe bishops must not, in that case, elect a successor or transact\r\nany business, but that the Council must be held as suspended till\r\nanother Pope should be duly elected by the Cardinals alone, and till\r\nit should be again called together by him. Pius IX ordained that this\r\nlaw should endure for ever, as the rule in all similar cases. This\r\nmeasure made the Council an appendage to the person of the Pope, not\r\ncapable of sustaining its existence without him, and consequently\r\nhaving no imaginable power over him. It also made it inferior to the\r\nCollege of Cardinals--an abnormal body, composed of \"creatures\" of the\r\ncrown, without any pretence to a constitutional place in the Christian\r\nChurch--\"Princes,\" and some of them, like Antonelli, not even priests.\r\n\"Pivots,\" as their name imports, true \"pivots\"[215] of the Court, which\r\nhas turned a religion into a school of costume, policy, and arms, they\r\nhave, we repeat, as Cardinals, neither name nor place, neither order\r\nnor office, in the known constitution of the Catholic Church. When\r\nmen who held that bishops were successors of the Apostles allowed the\r\nright of all the bishops in the world to choose their own head to be\r\nconfiscated by an edict in favour of these Court officers, they were\r\nnot likely afterwards to be strong supports of any true authority, only\r\nof that arbitrary will which finds all the sanction of its acts in\r\nitself. The Cardinals may well denounce nationalism, since to uphold\r\ntheir pretensions the mitres of all nations must bow to the hat of a\r\nprince in the suite of one little king. It would be unreasonable to\r\nthink less of a man for wearing a scarlet hat and scarlet stockings,\r\nif his position in life calls him to it; almost as unreasonable as\r\nto think more of him for it. But to put a prince into that grotesque\r\nCourt dress, and then turn him, by virtue of his Court position, into\r\na titular bishop, or archbishop, and to expect his irregular office to\r\nbe recommended by his incongruous attire, is a proof of the unlimited\r\nfaith of the Curia in costume.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the day taught two lessons. First, the hall proved to\r\nbe utterly unfit for deliberation, as every architect or public speaker\r\nmust have known that it would prove, though about twenty-four thousand\r\npounds had been spent in adapting a space within the Cathedral. But the\r\nsecond lesson of the day's experience was of a different kind. It had\r\nbecome plain that Fallibilists and Infallibilists were to be parted off\r\nfrom one another by a hard official line, and that no distinction would\r\nbe made between Fallibilists and Inopportunists. The Curia, instead of\r\nshowing any fear of the minority, was evidently resolved on letting it\r\nbe known that Rome was not the place to form an opposition. The Rules\r\nhad in fact already disposed of the minority.\r\n\r\nWe have intimated that possibly theologians came up to the Council\r\nwith no more knowledge of what awaited them than the bishops. This\r\nwas at least the case with Friedrich. On the Monday after the opening\r\nceremony, accompanied by Kagarer, theologian to his Grace of Munich,\r\nhe waited on the Secretary of the Council. I knew, says the Professor,\r\nthat at Trent every theologian was not entitled only, but bound, to\r\ntake part in the labours of the Council, by preparing papers and\r\npublicly discussing questions. But, he adds, \"we were undeceived with\r\na witness.\" The Secretary told them that the duty of theologians in\r\nconnexion with the Council was \"nothing.\" They were only to give\r\ninformation or advice to their respective bishops, as it might be asked\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nThe decision thus announced to the doctors had been taken eleven\r\nmonths previously. The Nine, at their meetings of January 24 and\r\n31, (_Cecconi_, p. 205) had determined that there should be no\r\ncongregation of inferior theologians, as the doctors were called,\r\nin opposition to the bishops, the superior theologians. The open\r\ndiscussions which had given light to the people on the one side and\r\nto the prelates on the other were thus quenched. The people were no\r\nmore to have any means of ascertaining what was being done with their\r\ncreed, nor even, when something had been done, were they to have means\r\nof ascertaining what were the processes by which the new dogmas had\r\nbeen established. All that they were now to learn was to be the _fait\r\naccompli_, henceforth to become the standard of faith for all and\r\nin all. The order of priests was to be shorn of its last vestige of\r\nrepresentation in the Councils of the Church. The bishops, on the other\r\nhand, were not to be allowed to know what could be said for or against\r\na proposed dogma, before they were called upon to close it up for ever.\r\nThis one turn of the screw wrung even from Cecconi a mild but distinct\r\nexpression of doubt. He feels (p. 205) that \"the Fathers generally\r\nlost a mighty assistance in the discharge of their high office.\" He\r\nventures to quote Pallavicino, the Jesuit historian of Trent, whose\r\nlanguage shows that the old Jesuits had broad views compared with\r\nthose now ruling. Pallavicino's words remind us of the cry of poor\r\nMonsignor Liverani: \"We might be allowed to be Liberals up to the mark\r\nof Bellarmine\"--\r\n\r\n    Many of the bishops were learned in the science of theology, but\r\n    the most eminent, as is the case in all sciences, were the private\r\n    theologians, since they had not been diverted by public cares from\r\n    regular study, without which eminent prudence is often acquired,\r\n    but not eminent erudition.\r\n\r\nBut Pius IX had no intention of allowing bishops to satisfy their\r\nconsciences by hearing all that could be said on both sides before they\r\ngave a judgment.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to find a neater specimen of the terms in which the\r\nabolition of a venerable franchise may be couched than in the words\r\nof Cecconi. He lets us know that on the 4th of July, 1869, the Nine\r\nresolved to \"confer on the theologians of bishops the right of being\r\neligible to be called to serve the committees of the Council.\" It would\r\nbe only in keeping with a system of quotation regularly practised if\r\nthis statement of Cecconi should be, hereafter, used to prove that\r\nthe theologians at the Vatican Council did not suffer any curtailment\r\nof their rights, but received an increase of them. But exclusion from\r\nthe right of pleading before \"my lords\" was not all the degradation\r\nawaiting the unfortunate doctors. Bishop Fessler told them that they\r\nwere free to give information or advice each to his own bishop, but,\r\nadds Friedrich, _only to him_. We wonder what man was not free to\r\ngive private advice if asked for it. They were not to be allowed _to\r\nattend meetings of the bishops; not even to meet among themselves to\r\nconsult in common upon questions affecting the Council_.[216] Friedrich\r\nwas not the most to be pitied of the theologians. Father Ambrose, a\r\nCarmelite, had been brought up from Germany by his general, a Spaniard.\r\nAt the first interview the general told him that the all-important\r\nquestion was that of Papal infallibility. Father Ambrose declared\r\nhimself a Fallibilist, and produced a work which he had prepared on\r\nthe subject. He at once lost his post; and the general wished to send\r\nhim off to Malta. Cardinal Hohenlohe pleaded for his restoration, but\r\nin vain. The general feared that the order would be utterly put to\r\nshame if in addition to the scandal of the Cracow nun, and that of\r\nFather Hyacinthe's defection, a theologian of the Order brought up to\r\nthe Council should be known as a Fallibilist. The poor man had even to\r\ngo to Cardinal Hohenlohe, and to beg of him to give him back a copy\r\nof his little work which he had presented to his Eminence. This the\r\nCardinal refused to do, saying that even if the general had ordered\r\nit, he had nothing to say to a Cardinal. Ambrose was permitted to\r\nreturn to Würzburg, and before he started a prelate said to him, \"I\r\nshould rejoice if any one recalled me or sent me home. We bishops have\r\nbeen ordered here to the Council without being told what we were to\r\ndeliberate upon, and now that I know it, I could gladly turn my back\r\nupon the Council and Rome.\"\r\n\r\nAnother minute touch of Friedrich at this moment shows how he heard a\r\ndevoted Roman adherent of the Papacy say that an officer had sent him\r\ntwenty scudi (about four pounds) as an offering to Peter's Pence; but\r\nhe had returned the money, telling his friend he would do better to\r\nspend it on his family. \"His conscience had dictated this course,\" for\r\nhe knew how Peter's Pence were spent.\r\n\r\nThe correspondent of the _Stimmen_ must have been under the triumphal\r\ninfluence of the opening, when he informed his German readers that\r\nwonderful unanimity reigned, and that what might be called the\r\nOpposition was daily shrinking up into nothing, and would soon reward\r\nonly microscopical research.[217] The _Unitá Cattolica_ of January 1\r\nalleged that the _Français_, in using the expression, \"A fraction of\r\nmalcontents,\" might possibly be right, if it meant an almost impalpable\r\nfraction; but if it meant anything more, it was false. The alleged\r\ndiscontent, it went on to say, was spoken of as if it related to the\r\nCommission of Proposals appointed by the Pope. Some were said to wish\r\nthat the Council itself should have had the selection of a committee.\r\nIt was false; no one complained. It could not be disputed that the\r\nPontiff, having the right to convoke, rule, and guide the Council,\r\nhad also the right to determine what questions should be submitted\r\nto it. Pius IX had, indeed, himself confirmed this in the Bull by\r\nwhich he settled the Rules of Procedure. This is not conscious but\r\nunconscious irony. It reflects the course of the Papacy, displaying\r\nits administrative force and its logical infirmity in one word. A\r\nright is first desired, then secretly assumed, next insinuated in\r\nindirect forms, and finally embodied in an act assuming it as already\r\nascertained; after which, this very act is taken as proof that it was\r\npreviously established. When the Nine met, they confessed that it was\r\nquestionable if the right existed to lay down rules for a General\r\nCouncil of the Catholic Church by a sub-committee of the Cardinals.\r\nBut they assumed the right as unchallenged, embodied the assumption in\r\nan edict, and now turned to that edict as proof of the pre-existing\r\nright. A few days later, the correspondent of the _Stimmen_ again said\r\nthat, while the intelligence furnished to the ordinary journals was\r\nabsurd, one thing might be relied upon, namely, that what was called an\r\nOpposition was daily diminishing.[218]\r\n\r\nAnother Jesuit, writing after the Council, did not confirm these\r\nstatements of the inspired organs, but followed the profane journals,\r\nwhose intelligence was at the time decried--\r\n\r\n    Behold, says Sambin, two camps face to face! On one side, Rome\r\n    and her Sovereign Pontiff, surrounded by a vast majority of the\r\n    bishops, displaying the banner of the Church as set up by her\r\n    divine Redeemer. On the other side, an uncertain number of men\r\n    belonging to all ranks of the hierarchy, seduced by illusory\r\n    appearances or frightened by the danger of attacking modern ideas\r\n    in front--men who fancy that the Church ought to parley with the\r\n    notions of the age.[219]\r\n\r\nThe orthodox view on this point was expressed by the _Civiltá_ in\r\nits first number after the Council was opened. \"The Press and public\r\nmeetings are the two mainsprings by which the spirit of the age, or\r\nMasonry, or, to give things their proper names, Satan, moves public\r\nopinion for his own ends.\"[220] At that moment Satan was busy not only\r\nwith the Italian and German Press, but with the _Standard_, _Saturday\r\nReview_, and other English papers.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of the Council was exhibited, not in the secular\r\nnewspapers, but in the clerical periodicals. Eight days after the\r\nopening session, the _Stimmen_ was informed how, on an afternoon as\r\nmild as summer, the grounds of the Villa Borghese were enlivened by\r\na review in honour of the Fathers of the Council. The troops were\r\nmuch commended, not omitting the _Squadriglieri_, whom the Italians\r\nprofanely charged with having been recruited from the brigands but\r\nwhom the Jesuits described as excellent Catholics. The _Civiltá_ was\r\nreally edified by this display. In the military review, it says--and\r\nwe repeat word for word--the profane spectacle was dominated by the\r\nthought of the _new crusaders_ defiling before so many bishops,\r\nspectators and a spectacle no longer witnessed at a military review. It\r\nwas well and truly said that this _review_ looked like a _function_ in\r\nSt. Peters'.[221]\r\n\r\nA few days later, the faithful, whose supply of news never related\r\nto either doctrine or discipline, were edified by an account of a\r\nperformance in a military casino, in honour of the Austrian and Swiss\r\nbishops. It is inferred that the Pope's foreign troops must be highly\r\neducated, because the beautiful scenery had been entirely painted\r\nby the soldiers. The curtain represented St. Michael the Archangel\r\novercoming the _first great rebel_. The first great rebel, by some\r\nwonderful prolepsis, was clad in a red shirt, and wore the features of\r\nGaribaldi. No writers so well know as the Jesuits how to make fun of\r\nGaribaldi's bit of ritualism, with his red shirt and poncho. A German\r\nwar-song of the middle ages, addressed to St. Michael, was sung with\r\nloud applause, and sung _encore_. Cardinal Prince Schwarzenberg, the\r\nArchbishops of Salsburg and Cologne, the Bishop of Mainz, and the\r\nPrussian Military Bishop, with a retinue of counts and one prince,\r\nhallowed and graced the performance.[222]\r\n\r\nIn spite of these diversions, and the protests and assertions of\r\nperfect unanimity made by the clerical writers, the indications which\r\nhad for some time been making themselves obscurely felt of a Court\r\nparty and an Opposition party, had at last emerged into painful\r\nconsciousness on both sides. The idea of a sovereign above any party\r\nwas too lofty for the place. One party, as we have seen stated by\r\nSambin, was Rome and her Pontiff, while the other was an opposition,\r\nnot against the opinions of Infallibilists, or the plans of a Cabinet,\r\nbut against the Sovereign. Both sides had been very reluctant to\r\nacknowledge the reality of such antagonism, even long after its\r\nexistence began to be tolerably evident. The Curia had nursed the hope,\r\nas we shall see, of all but unanimous adhesion to its preconcerted\r\nplans. It reckoned on the ascendant of the Pope when in presence, on\r\nthat of the Sacred College, on the sympathy of numbers, the witcheries\r\nof ceremony, the baits of promotion, and, if need should arise, on\r\nwholesome fear.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, even the prelates who most feared what was about\r\nto be done, disliked the idea of being in opposition, not only to\r\nthe Curia, but to the Pontiff, and that on a personal question. They\r\nflattered themselves, moreover, that the good feeling of the Pope would\r\nlead him to moderate his prompters, and would not allow him to expose\r\nbishops to difficulties with their flocks and their governments, which\r\nthey clearly foresaw. The men hoped that the general would modify his\r\nplans, and would win the campaign by strategy, without forcing them\r\nagainst stone walls.\r\n\r\nEven before the opening, a painful feeling, according to Friedrich, had\r\nseized upon some of the bishops, when studying the Rules of Procedure.\r\nFessler, he states, had told Dinkel, of Augsburg, that some dogmatic\r\nDecrees would be forthcoming on the opening day. Yet not a hint had\r\nbeen given as to what these Decrees might be; and such secrecy on\r\nmatters so solemn was taken ill.[223] So far as the Curia was preparing\r\na counter revolution, it acted only like any other political body in\r\nkeeping its plans hidden. But it was a different matter to make secret\r\npreparations for effecting changes in a creed that men had taught until\r\nthey were grey-headed, and then to expect them to face the alternative\r\nof either accepting the change or ruining their official prospects.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the opening session passed, when an address was signed by\r\nfourteen French prelates and the powerful Croatian Bishop Strossmayer,\r\nrepresenting to the Pope in humble yet clear terms the danger of any\r\nrestraint on the liberty of the Council. They did not rise in their\r\nplaces and move that the Council itself should frame its Rules of\r\nProcedure; they did not even move to accept the Rules laid before it\r\nin the Bull _Multiplices Inter_, with certain specified amendments.\r\nNothing short of this would have asserted the freedom of their\r\nAssembly. On the contrary, like all men trained under absolutism,\r\nthey did not know how to maintain their inherited rights against\r\nencroachment and at the same time to abide loyal and true; but\r\nsubmitted, grumbling at their wrongs, and groping for some opening in\r\nthe wall which shut them in. Had they attempted to bring forward such\r\na motion as we have supposed, it would soon have been seen whether\r\nthe assertions were or were not true which were made by English and\r\nAmerican bishops about the Council being as free as the Senates of\r\ntheir own nations. Any one attempting to make such a proposal would\r\nhave been informed that in the Pro-Synodal Congregation the Rules had\r\nbeen issued as a Papal Bull, and that in the first session the forms\r\ntherein prescribed had been acted upon; so that those Rules, not being\r\nan act of the Council, but of the Pope, were not subject to revision by\r\nthe Council; and, furthermore, that the Council had already practically\r\nadopted them. In fine, the prelates stood to some ideal Council in some\r\nsuch relation as we stand in to the Parliament; we cannot propose a\r\nmotion, but we can send in a petition. Yet our petition would go to the\r\nHouse itself, not to the Cabinet. It would be named in the hearing of\r\nthe House, and noted on its records. The petition of the poor bishops\r\ncould not be presented in the Assembly, no trace of it is in the\r\n_Acta_; its only open way was to the steps of the throne. It was never\r\nanswered, never mentioned in the official documents, and the faithful\r\nwho sought information in the accredited organs that rang with charges\r\nof misrepresentation against worldly ones, never received a hint of any\r\nsuch transaction.\r\n\r\n\"Unless the thoroughness of examination and the perfect freedom of\r\ndiscussion are as clear as day,\" say the fifteen prelates, it is to be\r\nfeared that the effect will be to lower religion in public esteem and\r\nto aggravate the troubles of the Church.[224] The first point on which\r\nthe petitioners fastened was the right of proposition. Yet, simple as\r\nthis right was, they had not the courage to claim it. Perhaps even they\r\nwere deceived, as Quirinus and many other writers evidently were,[225]\r\nat the first glance, by the way in which the denial of that right was\r\nveiled over in the Rules of Procedure. The mode of putting it is one\r\noften employed in the documents of the Roman Court. When some serious\r\nrestriction is to be announced, you may find at first a sentence or\r\nparagraph which conveys an impression of something different, perhaps\r\nopposite to what is to be the conclusion. Indeed, practised Liberal\r\nCatholics sometimes write as if with them it was a tacit canon of\r\ninterpretation that when in Jesuit teaching you find a principle\r\naffirmed in the opening of a paragraph, that is the principle which\r\nis to be rendered nugatory by qualifications ere you reach the close;\r\nand when you find a principle disclaimed, that is the principle which,\r\nunder veils and covers, is to be set up.\r\n\r\nIn the Rules of Procedure the section on proposals did not say that\r\nno Bishop should be permitted to propose anything in the Council,\r\nwhich was the thing meant. To plainly say what was meant, would be to\r\ncopy the Tower of Babel, the wicked modern Parliament. The section\r\nsaid that though the right of bringing forward proposals belonged to\r\nthe Pope alone, he wished the bishops freely to exercise it. This\r\nsufficed to set many writing good news home. They did not wait to weigh\r\nthe following words. These showed that the right of proposition,\r\nhandsomely announced to the Fathers of the Council, was just the right\r\nwhich everybody in the world possessed, that, namely, of forwarding a\r\nsuggestion to the Pope. Curiously enough, even that common right was\r\ngranted here only in a circuitous way, for the Pope himself named a\r\nCommission to receive propositions from the bishops, to consider them,\r\nand to report to him. If, after such report, he should wish any of\r\nthem to come before the Council, he would send them forward. Most of\r\nthe bishops, being unused to Parliamentary forms, began only by slow\r\ndegrees to realize the fact that thus they had no right of proposition\r\nwhatever. It was a good while before they became aware that they were\r\nsimply in the position of private people. Anybody in Rome, or in\r\nCalcutta, could forward a suggestion to the Pope without going to a\r\nRoyal Commission.\r\n\r\nThe address of the fifteen bishops requests that authors of proposals\r\nshall be admitted to a hearing before the Commission, and also that\r\nthe latter shall be required to assign reasons when it reports against\r\nany proposal. But the bishops do not even ask leave to put their\r\nsuggestions upon the books. That would, at least, have given members\r\nthe right of letting their fellow members know what they wished to see\r\ndone. The idea of entering a notice of motion would of course have been\r\nin that atmosphere not liberty but licence. They do, however, venture\r\nto suggest that some members of the Commission might be elected by the\r\nCouncil. They also point out that secrecy cannot be really maintained.\r\nThe address, as we have said, was not even answered.\r\n\r\nHergenröther, the writer on whose authority Cardinal Manning requires\r\nus to rely, devotes some strength to this question. He begins by\r\naffirming that in Trent there was no fixed order. His proof for that\r\nassertion is that there is no written Code of Procedure, the record\r\nshowing only the course actually followed from time to time. He also\r\nasserts that the bishops in the Vatican Council _had perfect liberty_\r\nof proposition. He moreover informs those who learn from such as he,\r\nthat in all great assemblies the right of the President includes that\r\nof proposition, at least so far as to give him the decision, as to the\r\norder in which the proposals are taken.[226] Hergenröther, moreover,\r\naffirms that Friedrich wished to deny the right of proposition\r\nto the Pope--a blunder arising from not distinguishing between a\r\nright and an exclusive right. The Directing Congregation made a\r\ndistinction as singular as was this failure to distinguish on the\r\npart of Hergenröther. It held that the Pope had the direct right of\r\nproposition, and the bishops the indirect right. But the fact was that\r\nthey had no right of proposing to the Council whatever. They had no\r\nright beyond that of making a suggestion to the Pope, which, we repeat,\r\nanybody in the world could do; the only difference being that the one\r\nsuggestion went before a Royal Commission, while the other did not.\r\n\r\nThe Directing Congregation had been first of all inclined to let\r\nthe Fathers choose a committee of their own, but finally determined\r\nthat the Pope himself should appoint a commission. This was an\r\narrangement open to objections which even they did not wholly fail\r\nto see; but the Court historian finds a perfect answer by saying\r\nthat if a good proposal should rest unheeded the author of it would\r\nhave the satisfaction of having done his duty, and he must trust to\r\ndivine Providence, which would never fail the Church.[227] Clouds of\r\nwords were raised about this simple matter. The Catholics made solemn\r\nasseverations that the bishops had as perfect liberty of proposition as\r\nthe members of any public body. The Liberal Catholics protested that\r\nthey had not. They were cried down as slanderers.\r\n\r\nHefele, a learned German, gave confused and even contradictory advice\r\nas a consulter; first contending that the bishops should have a right\r\nof proposition, and then suggesting the very arrangements finally\r\nadopted. Sanguineti, a Roman consulter, plainly stated what was to be\r\naimed at, namely, that the Pope alone should have the right of public\r\nproposition, leaving to the bishops what he calls the right of private\r\nproposition; as the directing Congregation calls it, of indirect\r\nproposition, or, as we call it, of suggestion.[228]\r\n\r\nThe result, then, was that the bishops could not bring in any\r\nsubstantive motion, could not move for a subject to be taken into\r\nconsideration, could not put a notice of motion on the books, could\r\nnot move an amendment on what the President proposed, could not move\r\nthe previous question, could not move to decline taking the matter\r\ninto consideration, could not move to postpone it. All that they could\r\ndo was to speak to what the President proposed, to send suggested\r\namendments before a committee, and finally to vote Yea or Nay upon the\r\nquestion, in the form into which that committee ultimately put it.\r\nNo minutes of proceedings were printed, or even read day by day. No\r\nknowledge was allowed to speakers even of the reports taken of their\r\nown speeches; no sight of the reported speeches of others.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, bishop after bishop returned from the Council\r\nto denounce in pastorals those who had said that they had not the\r\nliberty of proposition. Even our English tongue had to make itself the\r\nvehicle of such statements for two mighty nations. Bishop bore witness\r\nto bishop, and they were true and all men were liars. Archbishop\r\nManning told how bishops \"of the freest country in the world\" had _said\r\ntruly_, \"The liberty of our Congress is not greater than the liberty\r\nof the Council.\"[229] We fear that American bishops might have quoted\r\nsimilar declarations from English ones. It is for members of Congress\r\nand of Parliament to judge.\r\n\r\n_La Liberté du Concile_ is a tract which, Friedrich says, if not\r\nwritten by Darboy, was inspired by him.[230] Only fifty copies were\r\nprinted during the Council, for distribution exclusively among the\r\nCardinals, and with the strictest injunctions of secrecy. The whole\r\nis given in the _Documenta ad Illustrandum_.[231] It is introduced by\r\nan article from the _Moniteur_ of the 14th February, 1870. One of its\r\nearliest sentences compresses the secret history of Cecconi into a few\r\nwords. \"The first unhappy thought, and that from which the Council now\r\nsuffers, was the wish, so to speak, to make the Council beforehand,\r\nand to make it without the bishops.\" It is right to mention that M.\r\nVeuillot says that this writer recounts ill, reasons worse, and draws\r\ninferences worst of all.[232]\r\n\r\nFor two years, complains this writer, the bishops had been refused\r\nany programme. They had not been afforded any possibility of studying\r\nquestions about to be raised, or of preparing themselves to discuss\r\nthem.[233] It would seem that the writer did not know that the\r\npreparations had extended over five years instead of two. He says\r\nthat the Council had not made its Rules of Procedure; the Pope had\r\nimposed them. It had not chosen one of its officers, not even a\r\nscrutineer; the Pope had selected them all beforehand. The reason\r\nfor the restraints imposed on the liberty of the bishops was stated\r\nby M. Veuillot as being to take away the liberty of evil, which the\r\nwriter considers an insult to the bishops. We may remark that this\r\nis a principle which, had it been acted upon by the great government\r\nabove us all, would have precluded every question as to the origin of\r\nevil. This tract affirms that the Commission for Proposals was composed\r\nexclusively of declared partisans of the Court. That statement is not\r\nquite accurate. Rauscher was a mighty instrument of the Curia in its\r\nordinary aggressions on the civil power, but too sensible to approve\r\nof its present projects. Cardinal Corsi also, though at last he voted\r\nwith the majority, was all along reputed as averse to the definition\r\nof infallibility. The next complaint is that the Committees for the\r\nimportant subjects of Dogma, Discipline, the Religious Orders, and\r\nOriental affairs, are permanent, chosen once for all, and chosen by a\r\nstrictly party vote, excluding every Fallibilist. Thus, is it urged,\r\nonly ninety-six bishops out of nearly eight hundred would ever know\r\nanything of those real deliberations which principally determine the\r\nresults of the Council. These Committees would have to decide upon all\r\nalterations to be made in Drafts of Decrees after the first Drafts\r\nhad been discussed by the bishops generally. They would have the sole\r\nresponsibility of bringing them forward in the definitive shape in\r\nwhich they must be voted upon, Yea or Nay. Thus, he repeats, seven\r\nhundred out of eight hundred are absolutely excluded from a share, at\r\nany time whatever, in the most important operations of the Council. The\r\nindignation of the author would not have been lessened had he known\r\nthat this particular point had been carefully weighed by the Nine.\r\nThey at first resolved to allow the Council to elect, as had been done\r\nat Trent, committees for each particular matter as it arose. It was,\r\nhowever, subsequently foreseen that this regulation might open the way\r\nto the election of men who were not safe. After a discussion, a man\r\nwho had displayed ability in treating the matter in hand might be\r\nelected on the committee for that reason alone! If, on the other hand,\r\ncommittees were chosen once for all, it would be easy to secure the\r\nexclusion of wrong names in that one election, and no opportunity of\r\nchanging them would ever arise.[234]\r\n\r\nThe writer of _La Liberté du Concile_ proceeds to say that a number\r\nof bishops urgently requested the Pope, in order to ensure a wise\r\nselection of these all-controlling committees, to direct that the\r\nFathers should be divided into groups, and should in these discuss\r\npending questions separately, on the plan adopted in the _Bureaux_ of\r\nthe French and Italian Chambers. Thus the Fathers, who for the most\r\npart were perfect strangers to one another, would in a little time\r\nlearn who were the capable men, and would be in a position to make\r\na proper selection. This appeal, probably the one we have already\r\nmentioned, was not even answered.\r\n\r\nThe lords of wide dioceses, accustomed to rule their clergy with\r\nmilitary authority and to face statesmen with considerable pretensions,\r\nwere now reduced to struggle for very small liberties. They attempted\r\nto form themselves into groups, by nation or by language. So far as\r\nthe French were concerned, this arrangement failed. Each of their two\r\nCardinals, De Bonnechose and Matthieu, received a group in his own\r\nhouse. Cardinal De Bonnechose would not consent that all the French\r\nbishops should meet together. Even when they divided, he went for\r\nadvice to Antonelli, who intimated that they ought not to meet in\r\n_larger groups than fifteen or twenty_. The effect of all this was,\r\nthat when the time for making arrangements for the election of the\r\ncommittees came, they had no concert among themselves; and the writer\r\nstates that after that election, the annoyances confronting Cardinal\r\nMatthieu were so great, that he felt obliged for a time to leave Rome.\r\nHereupon the bishops who had previously met at his house resolved to go\r\nto that of Cardinal De Bonnechose, who had, for once, to receive them;\r\nbut he again consulted Antonelli, and declared that this first general\r\nmeeting should also be the last.\r\n\r\nThe bishops desired to select the best men of their own nation to be\r\nnominated as members of the permanent committees. The Curia, however,\r\nhad provided for all that. The \"ticket\" of Cardinal De Angelis, as\r\nit would be called in America, was the counter move. The German and\r\nHungarian bishops had shown more cohesion than the French. They met\r\ntogether, and made a selection of the principal men from their own\r\nnumber; but that resulted in nothing. The Curia had selected those\r\nwhom it preferred, setting aside the men who stood high with their\r\nfellow-countrymen, and putting forward those who with them would\r\nhave had no chance. An official list was prepared bearing the name\r\nof Cardinal De Angelis. Of course the bishops _in partibus_, the\r\nmissionary bishops, and all the mere dependents of the Court, voted\r\nfor the official list; and thus the whole of the four permanent\r\ncommittees were composed, as the secret preparatory commission had\r\nbeen, exclusively of the nominees of the Curia. The Jesuit Press\r\ngloried over this result. M. Veuillot said that the Committee on Faith\r\nwas an echo of the great commission appointed by the Pope. Sambin\r\nrecorded the triumph, with satisfaction, for permanent history. The\r\nresult showed that the Court could count on about 550 votes.[235] De\r\nAngelis was appointed to the vacant post of Chief President, in room\r\nof Reisach. Cardinal Schwarzenberg was not on any committee, Hohenlohe\r\nwas out of the question. Even the Archbishop of Cologne was only on a\r\npetty committee for granting leave of absence. But Bishop Senestrey,\r\nof Regensburg, the author of the throne-upsetting speech, was on the\r\nall-important committee for dogma.\r\n\r\nThis manoeuvre excited strong indignation amongst all shades of\r\nthe marked men. They found themselves shut off from such a part in\r\ndeliberations as would have been granted by any worldly cabinet to an\r\nhonourable Opposition. Then, the mode of securing the result by the\r\nexpedients of a political election caused bitter recollections of\r\nfrequent admonitions, given both verbally and in the Press, not to\r\nreason about the Council as an ordinary human assembly, but to evince\r\na worthy confidence in the all-guiding power of the Holy Ghost. The\r\n_Rheinischer Merkur_ remarked that the Romans had a saying, that at\r\nthe beginning of a conclave the devil reigns, then the world carries\r\nall before it, and only at the last does the Holy Ghost turn both out\r\nand regulate things according to His own will. This genuine specimen\r\nof Roman mockery is applied to the Council by the _Merkur_ saying that\r\nas yet the third stage had certainly not set in.[236] The selection,\r\nsaid the _Merkur_, of committees was one-sided and narrow-minded.\r\nThe Archbishop of Paris and the Bishop of Orleans saw themselves\r\nthrown aside, and nominal bishops put in the places they ought to\r\nhave occupied. The German bishops, who had strongly confided in the\r\nmoderation of the Curia, found that no amount of trimming would avail;\r\nnothing short of a sound profession on the question of infallibility.\r\nVitelleschi says that the clearest, most sincere and disinterested\r\nopposition was that of the German bishops. They knew what they meant,\r\nand also knew that they expressed the collective sense of their people;\r\nbesides, they always acted with moderation. He ascribes this moderation\r\nto two causes, namely, the fact that they consciously did express the\r\nviews of their people, and that they were, more or less, influenced\r\nby Protestant modes of thinking. We confess that we see little proof\r\nthat any German bishops but the Curialistic ones were clear. We should\r\nrather have said that they were at sea. As to the moderation, however,\r\nVitelleschi adds that no such moderating influence of Protestant\r\nopinion appeared in the case of the English prelates. \"Several bishops,\r\nwith Manning at their head, more Catholic than the Pope, are noted for\r\ntheir Ultramontanism\" (p. 45). He adds, that even the Irish bishops\r\nwere less uniformly Infallibilists than the English. Of the Belgians,\r\nhe says that some naturally took the more liberal direction. De Mérode,\r\nwell known in Rome as a Court prelate, placeman, and speculator,\r\nlike Dupanloup, had been a champion of the temporal power, but now\r\nproved to be an anti-infallibilist. _Et tu, Brute, fili mi!_ exclaims\r\nthe Roman. As to the Spaniards, Vitelleschi says that they had been\r\ntrained in the school of Torquemada; and if they were content with\r\nbeing only Ultramontanes, that was something gained. These are the\r\ndivines of whom Quirinus says that if ordered by the Pope to vote that\r\nthere were four persons in the Trinity, they would do it. Vitelleschi\r\nremarks that the prelates of the United States were simpler than their\r\nbrethren, and less practised in ecclesiastical politics. Their want of\r\nany political importance at home, he believes, had predisposed them to\r\nwarmer sympathy with Curialistic views than might have been expected\r\nfrom them. Nevertheless, it proved in time that, under the forms of\r\necclesiastical discipline, the spirit of citizens of a free country did\r\nnow and then make its appearance among them. Another of his remarks is,\r\nthat, with the exception of Portugal, most of the bishops from small\r\ncountries were in the interest of the Curia. Speaking of Mermillod,\r\nfrom Geneva, Quirinus says that he \"rivals Manning in his fanatical\r\nzeal for the new dogma.\" Of course the Italian bishops, with very few\r\nexceptions, were Infallibilists, and those from South America were all\r\nupon the same side. The bulk of the Opposition bishops were German,\r\nHungarian, and French, reinforced by some of the older ones from\r\nIreland, a few of the English, a good many of the North American, and\r\nonly about twenty of the entire body of the Italian.\r\n\r\nThe various groups had now everything to stimulate them to put their\r\nproposals into shape. Those of the Curia were in shape already. They\r\nnaturally took the old direction of conforming the creed to innovations\r\nin practice. At Trent this was done with many innovations, which must\r\neither fall into discredit or be lifted above dispute. In this way was\r\nthe demand for a reform of the Church to raise her to the level of the\r\ncreed, met by a determination to bring down the creed to the level of\r\nthe Church. The two movements were confronted. Reformation, on the\r\none side, renovating the condition of the Church; and Conformity, on\r\nthe other side, adulterating the creed. Both together resulted in the\r\nwide separation which has been witnessed ever since. The necessity now\r\npressing sprang from different causes. No party had arisen to challenge\r\nthe primacy of the Pope, even in the form of all but unlimited\r\nmonarchy, into which, under cover of the gentle word \"primacy,\" it had\r\nbeen monstrously developed. On the contrary, indeed, of late years\r\nthe faithful had shown increasing submissiveness, proportioned to the\r\ndangers surrounding the Pope. But the Papacy itself was moving for\r\nconstitutional powers which demanded a new dogmatic basis.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with the magnificence of the scheme of one fold and one\r\nshepherd, the notions of the German bishops, as disclosed by Friedrich,\r\nare an illustration of how administrators putter when immense issues\r\npress for solution. While the architects were designing a new coliseum,\r\nthe joiners and stone-cutters were great upon cusps and corbels. In\r\nanswer to the seventeen questions issued in Rome at the centenary of\r\nSt. Peter, the German bishops had deliberated at Fulda for five days.\r\nMarriage, as a mine yielding richly to the local authorities in fees,\r\nand to the Curia in dispensation taxes, and also as a means of power\r\nover females, and over the education of children, was naturally one of\r\nthe main points. Another point included the offences for which parish\r\npriests should be liable to deposition. On this the bishops advised the\r\naddition of two offences to the list--notorious fornication and open\r\nconcubinage.\r\n\r\nHints were thrown out about abolishing all benefices, as they were\r\nsaid to be feudal. The clergy could not be fully mobilized but by the\r\nabolition of permanent appointments. The whole effect of the questions\r\nwas to bring out the existence in Germany of too great toleration of\r\nintercourse with Protestants; intercourse to a degree not consistent\r\nwith the militant footing on which things were to be put. This applied\r\nto christenings, weddings, burials, and other events of life, where\r\nthe milk of human kindness sometimes will overflow, and men will\r\nforget that they belong to a society which scarcely regards those who\r\nare not of it as morally entitled to existence. The bishops naturally\r\ndesired that the number of _causae majores_, or reserved cases, should\r\nbe curtailed, as that would increase their own freedom and power. They\r\nalso expressed a wish that censures should not be enforced against\r\nCatholic judges who found themselves obliged to pronounce sentences\r\nadverse to the canon law. This they advised in order to avoid the\r\nexclusion of Catholics from the judicial bench. They moreover suggested\r\nthat unreasonably contracting debts and habitual drunkenness should be\r\nadded to the list of causes warranting the removal of a priest. They\r\ndid touch a few minute points of a properly religious kind, connected\r\nwith the forgiveness of sins, ordination, and other questions.\r\n\r\nFriedrich remarks that these ideas tended to the omnipotence of the\r\nbishops by sacrificing the parish priests. This object, however, was\r\na natural complement of the sacrifice of the bishops to the Curia.\r\nIf the bishop is himself an absolute dependent on the Court, all his\r\nsubordinates must be left to his mercy. The Curia knew how to lure on\r\nthe bishops to the forfeiting of their own franchises, by using their\r\nlove of power against the franchises of the priests.\r\n\r\nFriedrich gravely says that the movableness of the parish priests would\r\nnot cure the moral evils complained of. It is not by outward correction\r\nthat a man becomes morally better, but by the ennobling of the inner\r\nman, which, alas! is so little aimed at among the clergy. When a French\r\nbishop can say in the Senate, \"My clergy are a regiment; they are bound\r\nto march, and they do march,\" he only shows how the Christian spirit\r\nhas evaporated from among the hierarchy. A few weeks before Friedrich\r\nleft home he had conversed with Döllinger upon the seventeen questions,\r\nand he says that they were the only points respecting the Council\r\non which they did converse together. What the aged provost said,\r\nobserves Friedrich, will always remain in my memory. \"On one occasion,\r\nWindischmann remarked in my presence and that of others, 'If I was\r\ncompelled to answer according to the contents of the ordinary's book,\r\nwhether celibacy should be abolished or not, I should have to speak\r\nunconditionally for its abolition.'\"\r\n\r\nWe have seen, in a previous chapter, that some of the lower clergy had\r\nindicated plans of considerable range, but they pointed in a direction\r\nin which Rome was incapable of going. Great attention was attracted by\r\na project, appearing with the name of a learned layman in Switzerland,\r\nDr. Segesser.[237] His charter had no less than twelve points, which\r\nare well worth a moment's notice.\r\n\r\n1. He held that the Church, in having, for the first time in her\r\nhistory, declined to invite the co-operation of governments with the\r\nCouncil, must now declare for the separation of Church and State.\r\n\r\n2. The Council must be a Reform Council in the fullest sense of the\r\nword.\r\n\r\n3. It must certify the freedom of its members to the world.\r\n\r\n4. It must be declared that all who believe in the redeeming work of\r\nChrist belong to the Christian communion.\r\n\r\n5. No dogma must be added unless urgently called for, not only by\r\ntheologians, but by the faithful.\r\n\r\n6. The primacy being divine, but the Papacy being only a joint product\r\nof Roman jurisprudence and theology, the dogma of the pontifical\r\ninfallibility of the Pope, which would lead back to theocratic ideas,\r\nwould set the Church and State on a war of mutual annihilation.\r\nTherefore it is the absolute duty of the Church to declare herself\r\ncompletely released from the theocratic ideas of the great Popes of the\r\nmiddle ages.\r\n\r\n7. The question of infallibility must not be passed over in silence,\r\nbut must be solemnly declared to be in opposition to the right idea of\r\nthe constitution of the Church.\r\n\r\n8. In mixed questions, such as those of the Church and State, laymen\r\nshould have some voice.\r\n\r\n9. The temporal power must be treated as a local Roman institution,\r\nand not confounded with the affairs of the universal Church.\r\n\r\n10. Freedom of teaching, of organization, and of worship, and equality\r\nwith all other communions, must be proclaimed; and the Church would\r\ndo well if she gave up all claim to the immunity of her property, and\r\nplaced it entirely under the control of the common law.\r\n\r\n11. The Index to be given up.\r\n\r\n12. We give this in full: \"The Christian State was a great ideal, but a\r\nyet greater is a State of Christians. To attain to the last the Church\r\nmust not domineer, but must possess freedom, and give it.\"\r\n\r\nThe language of this Liberal Catholic, brought up among German\r\nProtestants on the one hand and Swiss ones on the other, would sound\r\naltogether alien to the ears of the Cardinals, and would only deepen\r\ntheir painful impression of the evil influences of Protestant teaching\r\nupon the children of the Church. Enough occurred at the Council to show\r\nthat, even among the bishops, there were one or two who would have\r\ndared to propose some of the points in Dr. Segesser's scheme, had the\r\nmembers of the Council been permitted to make proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 213: _Acta Sanctae Sedis_, vol. v. p. 279.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 214: Ibid. p. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 215: The popular explanation \"hinge\" is quite correct; the\r\nancient hinge was a pivot inserted in a mortise, on which the door\r\nturned.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: Compare _Quirinus_, 86, and _Tagebuch_, 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: _Stimmen_, N.F., vi. p. 170.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 218: Id., p. 172.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 219: _Sambin_, p. 41.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 220: VII. ix. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 221: _Civiltá_, VII. ix. 103.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 222: The first number of the _Civiltá_ for 1876 (p. 104)\r\ncontains an account of an audience in which the Pope made a speech to\r\npilgrims from Brittany.

Hefele, when recommending that the\r\nbishops should have the right of proposition, quotes what occurred at\r\nthe Council of Trent, when the Archbishop of Capaccio-Vallo, on May\r\n10, 1546, repelled the claim of the Legate, Cardinal De Monte, to the\r\nexclusive right of proposition. The Archbishop cried, \"What am I to\r\ndo if anything occurs to me which ought to be proposed in this holy\r\nCouncil?\" To this De Monte replied, that if either his Grace or any\r\nother prelate wished to propose anything, they must submit it to the\r\nLegates, who would bring it forward, if they thought well. But should\r\nthe latter unjustly, or without cause, refuse to bring it forward,\r\nthen the author, whoever he was, should himself do so. But Hefele does\r\nnot point to the fact that De Monte made this concession only after\r\nbeing driven to it by force of opposition. Earlier in the very same\r\nday, he had asserted the exclusive right of the Legates to propose,\r\nand had been confronted by the Cardinal Archbishop of Trent with the\r\nplump declaration that he did not want to take the right of proposition\r\nfrom the Legates, but he thought he also might propose what seemed to\r\nhim right. Then the Legate and the Cardinal, who had been for some\r\ntime engaged in a passage of arms, apologised to one another. That,\r\nhowever, did not prevent De Monte from again attempting to establish\r\nthe claim of the chair to the exclusive right of proposition, by once\r\nmore asserting it. It was on this second attempt that the Archbishop of\r\nCapaccio-Vallo reclaimed, and then the Legate had, with ill grace, to\r\ngive way.

Quirinus and Fromman say that\r\nDarboy and Strossmayer (Friedrich says that Dupanloup and Strossmayer)\r\nattempted to speak on the Rules of Procedure, but were stopped by\r\nCardinal De Luca, on the ground that what the Holy Father had decreed\r\ncould not be discussed. The official writers at the time said not a\r\nword of the incident, nor is it named in the _Acta Sanctae Sedis_, nor\r\nin _Frond_.\r\n\r\nThus the bishops had now ascertained their position, but too late.\r\nQuirinus naturally says that had the assembly been, in some measure,\r\nprepared for the Rules, there would have been opposition; but good care\r\nhad been taken that the assembly should not be prepared, and should\r\nnot have any chance of offering opposition. The first gleam of hope,\r\nadds this author, excited by the announcement that the bishops would\r\nbe allowed to propose measures, had speedily vanished. Lord Acton says\r\n(p. 63): \"The bishops felt themselves in an entangled position. Some\r\nbegan to speak of going home. Some complained that the Rules foreclosed\r\nquestions involving divine rights, and said that they felt bound to put\r\neven the existence of the Council to stake.\"\r\n\r\nThe election of the Permanent Committee on Dogma was the great work of\r\nthe day. Archbishop Kenrick's Latin note[238] states that lithographed\r\nlists were distributed some days before the election, with the\r\ninscription, _To the honour of Mary, conceived Immaculate_; and that\r\nthese lists were recommended by the name of Cardinal De Angelis. Four\r\nhundred of the votes sent in gave the list entire. It was by these\r\ntactics that every Fallibilist, without exception, was excluded from\r\nthe committees. But Canon Pelletier, who wrote what in _Frond_ passes\r\nfor the history of the Council and is a good history of the ceremonies\r\nand the dresses, declares that the election proved the perfect freedom\r\nof the Fathers, for though all the names on the official list were\r\nchosen, they were not brought in according to the order in which they\r\nstood on that list. The French prelates of the minority were especially\r\nincensed, both against their leaders and against those whose superior\r\ntactics had frustrated their unskilful attempts to unite. Every\r\nFrenchman felt that all who represented the traditions and the spirit\r\nof the Roman Catholic Church in France were now, in Rome, placed under\r\na species of ostracism. The Fathers left this exciting sitting with\r\nanother Bull in their hands. Again Letters Apostolic to the present!\r\nThe _Acta Sanctae Sedis_ affirm that the work of preparing this Bull\r\ncould not be got through in time to send it to the Fathers before the\r\nCouncil. Its title was gentle. It was a Bull to Limit the Censures of\r\nthe Church. Quirinus mentions a mission undertaken by Cardinal Pitra,\r\na Frenchman, with the intention of bringing the prelates of his own\r\ncountry into accord with the Curia. This he followed up by a similar\r\nattempt with the German bishops. Pitra began by describing Dupanloup to\r\nthe latter as \"a mischievous teacher of error,\" but he was stopped, and\r\ntold that the Germans agreed with Dupanloup.\r\n\r\nA favourite topic of conversation now was the chance of disorganizing\r\nthe Opposition. The first checks appeared to have had the effect of\r\nconsolidating it, but the resources of the Court were generally assumed\r\nto be efficacious. Over and over again was it asserted that the hope\r\nof a robe of some distinguishing hue, or of a title on the list of\r\ndomestic prelates of the Pope, would win over almost any bishop, an\r\nassertion which proved not to be correct.[239] Quirinus, in common with\r\nGerman writers generally, speaks of the honour of being on that list\r\nas one that ought to be coveted rather by menials than by dignitaries;\r\nand Italians may often be heard saying much the same thing. Again,\r\nfaculties enabling a bishop to give absolution, or dispensations, in\r\ncertain reserved cases, yield to him both power and fees. \"Nine bishops\r\nout of ten want favours\"--an assertion of Quirinus--seems bold, but it\r\nwas written in Rome.\r\n\r\nThe Bull professing to limit the censures of the Church, was found\r\nto be another case of a winning title to a dreadful document. The\r\ncensures with which it dealt were only a portion out of Rome's store,\r\nthose, namely, under which one falls by the very act of committing\r\nthe offence, without any need of trial or sentence. They are called\r\noffences _Latae Sententiae_, or judged already. He that confesses to\r\none such act is, _ipso facto_, excommunicate, or, in the less heinous\r\ncases \"suspended.\" The Bull, as we have said, professed to limit the\r\nnumber of these cases; many of which represent multitudes in all Roman\r\nCatholic countries, who must either shun the confessional, knowing that\r\nin that tribunal they are judged already, or must go to it to find\r\nthemselves pronounced outside of the kingdom of grace, and incapable of\r\nrestoration except by special powers granted from Rome, which always\r\nimply special fees.\r\n\r\nIt was freely said, This is a re-issue of the Bull _In Coena Domini_,\r\nthe terrible syllabus of excommunications, at one time annually\r\npublished; a custom which had ceased since the days of Clement XIV.\r\nThis cessation was often cited as indicating greater mildness in\r\nthe spirit of the Roman Court. In the new Bull _Apostolicae Sedis_\r\nthese excommunications reappeared. They were under different heads.\r\nThree classes were reserved to bishops, so that no ordinary priest\r\ncould release from them. Twenty-nine classes were reserved to the\r\nPontiff, so that no bishop could release from them. Four classes were\r\nnot reserved to any one.[240] Some bishops declared that they found\r\nexcommunications here of which they had never been aware up to that\r\nmoment. Vitelleschi said that if some found in old books were omitted,\r\nthe Bull re-enacted all of the penal code of the Church that was\r\nin force. According as men looked at this document, from a fiscal,\r\nhierarchical, or monarchical point of view, their appreciation of\r\nit varied. Beyond excommunicating all heretics and heretical books,\r\nwith the readers, abettors, and so forth, it dealt with few matters\r\nwhich any true theologian would not gladly banish from his bounds, as\r\ntrespassers.\r\n\r\nThe hierarchical aspect of the Bull was striking. More than one of its\r\nsections pronounced excommunication upon the sin of appealing from\r\nany act of the Pope to a future General Council. This was the mortal\r\nblow to the doctrine that a Council could judge, and even depose, the\r\nPope, as Councils had done. Being issued in the face of a General\r\nCouncil actually sitting, no alternative remained but that of conflict\r\nbetween the Council and the Pope, or else final abandonment of this\r\nonce vigorous doctrine. The defiant crowings of the Gallican cock were\r\nfor ever hushed by this one grip in the claws of the Vatican eagle.\r\nThis Bull, as compared with the action of the Council of Constance,\r\nwhich deposed two Popes and itself elected one, served to measure the\r\ndecline of the episcopal and the growth of the pontifical power in the\r\nChurch. Many of the bishops were old enough to have maintained the\r\ndoctrine that the Council was above the Pope, against Protestants,\r\nwho innocently accused all Roman Catholics of being Papists. If any\r\none of them thought of standing by the old flag, what was he to do?\r\nTo put a notice of motion on the books? That was not permitted. To\r\nsend a suggestion to the Twenty-six? It might as well go into his own\r\nwastepaper basket as into theirs. To speak upon the point? That would\r\nbe out of order, for bishops were to speak only on matters proposed,\r\nand nothing was to be proposed but what the Pope proposed. Moreover,\r\neven if in speeches irrelevant matter should be allowed, such matter as\r\nthat now contemplated would be at once pronounced rebellion. It would\r\nbe an attempt to discuss what the Holy Father had already decreed.\r\nThus the question of the relative judicial powers of the single Bishop\r\nof Rome, and of all the other bishops of the world collectively, was\r\nsettled by an arbitrary sentence, uttered in the face of all the\r\nbishops assembled in conclave; and their assembly, though called a\r\nGeneral Council, had no liberty to canvass the decision!\r\n\r\nIt was a hard dilemma for a man to be placed in who had a sense either\r\nof human rights or of a divine office to defend. But the hand of power\r\nwas over the bishops. No man who opposed even embryo Decrees could\r\never reasonably hope for a hat; and he who should venture to attack a\r\nBull actually issued must expect to see his mitre reduced to an empty\r\ndignity by the withdrawal of his faculties. So the bishops saw a Bull\r\nwhich \"thrust the souls entrusted to them by thousands out of the\r\nChurch\"; and what could they do? \"The more excommunications, the more\r\nperplexed and tormented consciences,\" cries Quirinus--reminding us\r\nof what might often be heard in the old times from thoughtful men in\r\nRome. The whole effort of the priests, they would say, is to keep the\r\nconscience in agony, or at least in unrest; for this drives people to\r\nthe confessor, and hence no end of gains.\r\n\r\nA diplomatist regarded the political aspects of the Bull as\r\nserious.[241] Excommunicating men for an appeal to a General Council\r\nwas, as he took it, both the forerunner and the application of the\r\ndogma of infallibility. Excommunicating all who should punish bishops,\r\nor higher officers of the Church, without making an exception for\r\nany breach whatever of law, and, moreover, excommunicating any who,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, should obstruct the execution of Papal\r\nmandates, were not only blows but stabs at all civil authority. The\r\ndiplomatist argued that the way in which the Pope abolished privileges\r\ngranted by his predecessors was a poor pledge of the value of any\r\nengagements into which the Papacy might enter. The diplomatist ought to\r\nhave known that the immunity of the clergy from lay jurisdiction was an\r\nessential part of the restoration to be accomplished. He ought also to\r\nhave known that \"the free communication\" of the Pope with the faithful,\r\nor his right to promulge in all countries his decrees as their highest\r\nlaw, was equally essential. The excommunication, not only of heretics,\r\nbut of all who should harbour or defend them, ay, or should even read\r\ntheir books, led Vitelleschi to raise a question for young theologians,\r\nwhether the Pope has not excommunicated himself and his own government,\r\nseeing he had done more than harbour heretics in an inn, by allowing\r\nthem a church outside the _Porta del Popolo_.\r\n\r\nThe Bull, said some, is only one of a series of measures to be framed,\r\nassuming the infallibility of preceding Popes. The dispute as to Bulls\r\nwhich taught any dogma in theology or morals must for ever end. The\r\nvery points which Liberal Catholics had alleged to be without binding\r\nforce must be beyond appeal bound on earth, and of course ratified in\r\nheaven. A little circumstance not without significance was the fact\r\nthat, in publishing this document, the _Civiltá_ did not, as it usually\r\ndoes with official documents, furnish a translation of the Latin; and\r\nthe _Stimmen_, for Germany, followed the example.\r\n\r\nIn Germany or other Protestant countries an unfavourable impression\r\nmight be taken of the means to be resorted to for restoring Papal\r\nascendancy when, in the terrible category of offences judged already,\r\nwithout power to remit the sentence being _reserved to any one_,\r\neven to the Vicar of God, were found the following deeds, which many\r\nChristians would do with as cool a sense of duty as that with which\r\nunder slavelaws they would have befriended a fugitive slave: \"Injuring\r\nor intimidating Inquisitors, informers, witnesses, or other ministers\r\nof the Holy Office; tearing up or burning the papers of its sacred\r\ntribunal; or giving to any of the aforesaid aid, counsel, or favour.\"\r\nIf the day ever comes for attempting to put this law in force on the\r\nnow happy soil of England, blessed among her sons or daughters will\r\nthat one be who first has grace to endure the torments of the Holy\r\nOffice rather than not break the wicked law!\r\n\r\nThe fiscal bearing of the Bull would be the one first to strike and\r\nmost to occupy the Romans. Among men of the different orders, it\r\nwould occasion many a chat over questions of sin, sacraments, crime,\r\ncommunion, dispensation, remission, and redemption from purgatory, and\r\nof the fees flowing from each respectively. Quirinus represents the\r\nJesuits as beholding both the present and the future in rosy hues. The\r\nbishops would not be able to give absolution in the reserved cases, but\r\nthe Jesuits, in very many of them, would have _plenary power_. Hence\r\nthe bishops and the parochial clergy would suffer both in fees and\r\ninfluence, while the confessionals of their powerful rivals would be\r\nthronged. \"So, each of those multiplied excommunications is worth its\r\nweight in gold to the Order, and helps to build colleges and professed\r\nhouses.\"[242] Against the complaints which greeted the Bull, the\r\n_Civiltá_ alleged that it contained nothing new, and above all that it\r\nhad been posted up in the customary places in Rome, and was therefore\r\nalready the law of the Church universal. It was, on the other hand,\r\nboldly alleged that there were many new cases of suspension, interdict,\r\nor excommunication. Cardinal Antonelli, however, said that there were\r\nthree hundred excommunications which were not included in the Bull.\r\nLord Acton (p. 70) quotes a passage from the organ of the Archbishop of\r\nCologne, which shows that a good many more will have to be added before\r\nall actions are placed under perfect control. The Bull, it is said,\r\ndoes not prohibit \"the works of Jews, since Jews are not heretics; nor\r\ndoes it prohibit heretical pamphlets and journals, for these are not\r\nbooks; nor is the hearing of heretical books when read aloud forbidden,\r\nsince hearing is not reading.\"\r\n\r\nSome doubt hangs round the feeling of Cardinal Antonelli as to the\r\nCouncil. It was often asserted that he had been opposed to it from\r\nthe first, and was still decidedly so. This seems very probable. A\r\nworldly-wise man, capable of amassing a colossal fortune amid the ruins\r\nof a petty State, was hardly likely to believe that the _à priori_\r\nfabric of Tarquini and the other Jesuits, and the hot-headed schemes\r\nof the Pope, were solid enough to bear what was to be built upon them,\r\nor would lead to anything but defeat of the Papacy, and misery to\r\nthe nations. But in contradiction to this view, Quirinus says that\r\nAntonelli was too good a statesman and financier not to see the gain\r\nthat would flow from the new dogma in power and revenue. The new dogma\r\nwould doubtless enormously increase the power of the Curia within the\r\nChurch and over all her organizations. It would thus increase the\r\nfacility of bringing pressure to bear on a government by threats of\r\ndisaffection and agitation; but it would at the same time arouse all\r\nstatesmen, and eventually all intelligent men, except real disciples,\r\nagainst this sacerdotal empire. The most likely explanation of any zeal\r\nAntonelli may have shown for the new order of things would perhaps be\r\nthat while retaining his own view of the risks about to be run, he knew\r\nthat what was to be was to be, and determined to make the best of it.\r\n\r\nPapers immediately preceding the Bull in the pages of the\r\n_Civiltá_[243] seemed to indicate steadiness in the purpose either to\r\nbend the States or to break them. One article rang the changes on the\r\nold theme of the royal _placet_ or _exequatur_, \"the crime whereby\r\necclesiastical judgments are submitted to lay examination.\" \"The\r\nChurch,\" it adds, \"is not a foreign power, and hence concludes that the\r\nState has no right of precaution _jus cavendi_, in respect of her.\" The\r\ninternal power on which the Curia counts, in any country, being that of\r\nthreatening political agitation, the denial to the State of all right\r\nof precaution is essential to the full application of the principle\r\nof the Pope's \"free communication\" with all his subjects. A physical\r\nimpediment to the promulging of a Bull was, in old times, not more a\r\nprecaution than is, in our day, the principle that the law of the land\r\nis supreme. Just as the physical impediment was unlawful, so is the\r\nlegislative one; both stay the free course of \"the divine word.\" The\r\nold dukes, kings, and emperors, knowing that in the popular conscience\r\nthe law of the Pope ranked above all civil law, put a check upon the\r\npromulgation of his Bulls. We say, Promulge what you please, but the\r\nlaw of the land is the only law in the land. \"Here is the ground on\r\nwhich the future battle is to be fought out.\"\r\n\r\nJust between this article and the catalogue of excommunications came a\r\ndiscussion on unfulfilled prophecy. The Jesuit Father, Soprano, had,\r\nby comments on the prophecies of Balaam, Daniel, and the Apocalypse,\r\nclearly proved (according to his reviewer) that the city of Rome was\r\ndestined of God to be in perpetuity the centre of the Catholic Church.\r\nThe war against the kingdom of Christ was to fail, because \"she\" could\r\nnot lose her empire. But certain points as to the issue of the war now\r\nraging between the innovators and the kingdom of Christ, were open to\r\ninquiry--\"What dynasties will survive, what forms of government will\r\nprevail, what end will such and such kingdoms come to? Finally, we\r\nmay ask whether the Holy City, the mount of God, the capital of the\r\nCatholic world, Rome, may _for a time_ fall under the power of sinners\r\nand parricides, to be outraged by fire and sword, and defaced with\r\ncrimes.\" But, on the other hand, as to Rome being the stable domicile\r\nof catholicity, we might doubt of that only if the mount which cannot\r\nbe moved could be levelled with the ground.\r\n\r\nThis expositor is true to the old interpretation that the Babylon of\r\nthe Apocalypse is Rome, but that was the Pagan Rome, which \"fell with\r\nthe victory of Constantine.\" It will be observed that he takes the\r\npossibility of a temporary fall of the sacred Rome into the hand of the\r\nenemy as but an episode in a war that is to continue through a long\r\nseries of years.\r\n\r\nSince 1870, such forecasts as the above, when uttered, have not the\r\nsame triumphant tone. Nevertheless, they are now as clearly expressed\r\nas ever. But at the time of which we speak, if the bishops only read\r\nwhat was written for their learning they could not doubt as to the\r\nkind of service which was expected of them in the future. Friedrich\r\nintimates that they did not read it, when he relates that, in trying\r\nto enlighten one of them, he told him that the only way to understand\r\nthe Council was to study it with the _Civiltá Cattolica_ in one's hand.\r\nBut some of them showed a solicitude that could not be explained on\r\nany ground short of a perception of the dangers on which the Pope was\r\nrunning the hierarchy. They evidently did not take the view either of\r\nthose who thought that the Pope, erected into a vice-God, was about\r\nto become the real as well as the titular governor of the world, or\r\nthe view of those who looked on such dreams as matter to laugh at. The\r\ncalculations which produced the Crusades and the Thirty Years' War,\r\nwere dreams; but could the Church afford the indemnity which mankind\r\nwould exact for the miseries of such another struggle?\r\n\r\nDecember 16 marked the second failure in the organization of the\r\nCouncil. The first was the irremediable one of the absence of\r\nCardinal Reisach, and now, before serious discussion had begun, the\r\nthird General Congregation had to be postponed from the 16th to the\r\n20th,[244] because nobody could be heard in the hall. So six days\r\npassed without a sitting. Debates were actually to take place--a thing\r\nwhich had neither been desired nor expected. The hall was a good place\r\nfor spectacle, but a bad place for a parliament. In vain do bishops\r\nfrown and editors sneer at the writers who said that the Curia had not\r\nexpected much discussion. Cecconi comes to the support of the \"liars,\"\r\nas in official indignation they were called who told just what there\r\nwas to tell (p. 180)--\r\n\r\n    It was a deeply-rooted belief of the Directing Congregation that\r\n    but rarely would anything have to be referred to the committees\r\n    of the Council, because the Directing Congregation so well knew\r\n    how profound had been the attention given by the Preparatory\r\n    Commissions, that it seemed extremely difficult to believe that the\r\n    Drafts so prepared should not be received with general favour by\r\n    the Fathers.\r\n\r\nThis, in fact, is the excuse put forward by the Nine for not having\r\ngiven the bishops a word to say to the Drafts of Decrees before they\r\nwere confronted with them, as being already in a form to be voted upon.\r\nThe practice at Trent had been to state the question as a question.\r\nThen it was first discussed by the doctors in the presence of the\r\nbishops, who after that appointed a small committee of their own number\r\nto put resolutions into shape. The Council proceeded to discuss the\r\nDrafts so prepared, amending and again amending them, until they were\r\nin a form on which (if the subject was doctrine) almost every one could\r\nagree.\r\n\r\nIt was now, however, coolly assumed that so complete had been the\r\nwork of the secret commissions that the bishops would not raise any\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n    Great variety of opinion, say the Nine, would probably be rare,\r\n    seeing that the matters to be treated would be already prepared,\r\n    with great accuracy, by the special Commission, formed by\r\n    his Holiness, in conjunction with the Directing Congregation\r\n    (_Cecconi_, p. 180).\r\n\r\nCecconi repeats that the great confidence felt in the excellence of the\r\nwork of the theologians had generated in the majority of the members\r\nof the Directing Congregation this conviction. He is candid enough to\r\ngive the reason for bringing the Drafts ready made into full assembly,\r\nwhich was to prevent them from being exposed to the influences which\r\na restricted number of prelates might exert. That amounts to saying\r\nthat the able men whom a free assembly would have chosen to consider\r\nand digest its forms of resolution, were not to be allowed any chance\r\nof unitedly studying the forms prepared in secret for them. The Court\r\nwould bring its own plans, with all their details and complex notes,\r\nbefore the full assembly, which could never thoroughly sift them, and\r\nin which the majority was assured.\r\n\r\nWhile in almost everything else the rejection of parliamentary forms\r\nwas commended, as becoming an assembly which had to contend against\r\nboth the principles and results of parliamentary government, the\r\npractice of our own Houses in bringing in Bills ready drawn was pleaded\r\nin favour of the course taken in preparing extended drafts of dogmatic\r\ndecrees. But our Parliament has never yet been called together to vote\r\nthat laws are as good if issued by the Crown, without the advice of\r\nLords and Commons, as with it. Nor has it ever been asked to pass a\r\nmeasure which neither it nor any succeeding Parliament could recall.\r\nOur Parliament is never asked to discuss a Bill without first having\r\nthe right to say whether it shall or shall not be brought in. It\r\nnever finds a Bill before it which, if it pleases, it may not refer\r\nto a special committee. Any member can move the rejection or the\r\npostponement of the whole, can move the omission or amendment of any\r\npart, and can take the sense of the House. None of these things could\r\nbe done at the Vatican Council. The bishops could make Latin speeches\r\nin a row, first on the Draft as a whole, and then, in a second row,\r\non the parts. But only twenty-four of their number could ever put a\r\nhand to the amending of the proposed statute. With those twenty-four\r\nwere associated irresponsible persons, non-members. As that mixed body\r\nfinally shaped the propositions, must the Fathers vote upon them, with\r\na Yea or Nay that sealed the creed of their churches for ever.\r\n\r\nIt was not wonderful that the Curia should believe in the perfection of\r\nthe Roman theology, since they took their own government for perfect,\r\nand the capital for a model city of the saints. The German estimate of\r\nthe Court theology is indicated by Quirinus when he says that \"though\r\nthe Pope had four hundred theologians, theology is now rare, very rare,\r\nin Rome.\" He goes on to assert that if one should say that ability to\r\nread the Greek Testament and the Greek Fathers in the original was a\r\nnecessary qualification of a theologian, \"he would be ridiculed.\" As to\r\nthe divinity even of the bishops, the evidence of Quirinus is little\r\nmore flattering than that of Friedrich; but the discussions yet to\r\ncome will show that men of real power were not wanting.\r\n\r\nThe first Scheme or Draft of Decrees on dogma now appeared. It was\r\nnothing less than a book of one hundred and forty quarto pages,\r\ncontaining eighteen chapters and fifty-four paragraphs. Frond makes it\r\nfolio and of 131 pages.\r\n\r\nThe _Rheinischer Merkur_ quotes a Catholic journal which in admiration\r\nof this masterpiece says that when adopted by the Council it would form\r\na text-book. Yet this mass of divinity, any phrase, almost any word\r\nof which might affect the vital truths of religion, was put before\r\nthe bishops with only a few days to study it, and they were expected\r\nto vote it as an irreformable creed, to be ready for promulgation, as\r\nbound on earth and bound in heaven, on January 6, the day decreed in\r\nthe first session! Friedrich, looking at this bulky pamphlet, cries,\r\nAll through we have the language of the schools; any one familiar with\r\nthe Jesuit writings sees at once by whom it has been prepared.\r\n\r\nGraf W., a Roman prelate, paid Friedrich a visit arrayed in all his\r\nvestments and decorations. Surprised at such a display by a stranger,\r\nFriedrich asked himself, Does he want to make an impression upon me,\r\nor to excite a longing for similar clothes? The conversation turned\r\nupon infallibility, and the Count Monsignore said that it would be\r\ncarried through; for when the Curia had committed itself to anything,\r\nit was not to be balked. Friedrich, saying that for his part he had\r\nnothing to do but to speak according to his conscience, and that as a\r\npriest he knew well what must be his course when once the point was\r\ndecided, went on to state that, not having his eye on a canonry or a\r\nbishopric, and being happy in his independent position as a professor\r\nin the university, he felt free. This surprised the Curialist, but\r\nFriedrich in turn was still more surprised when the man in soft raiment\r\nand living in kings' houses said that it was otherwise with him. He\r\nbelonged to the Roman prelacy, and if he meant to continue in it, he\r\nmust do what he was bid.\r\n\r\nThe German doctor was struck by hearing people assure him that life\r\nwas tolerably safe in Rome if you were sure of your cook, your doctor,\r\nand your chemist (p. 30).\r\n\r\nThe German bishops had not, like the French, asked permission to meet\r\namong themselves, but their place of meeting had been cared for.\r\nMonsignor Nardi, a slashing writer, and a conspicuous member of the\r\nCuria, spared no pains to secure them for his own house. Cardinal\r\nHohenlohe offered his for the purpose, but he scarcely received a civil\r\nanswer. Even German bishops said as much as that they should compromise\r\nthemselves by being identified with him. They began to feel their\r\nposition very delicate. As they were assembled on December 22, with\r\nCardinal Schwarzenberg in the chair, they were joined for the first\r\ntime by three favourites of the Curia--Senestrey, Martin, and Leonrod.\r\nBut when Senestrey found that they were discussing the propriety of\r\npetitioning the Pope for a relaxation of the Rules, he remembered that\r\nbusiness required his presence elsewhere. We may be ready to smile at\r\nmen, holding professedly the position of members of a Council, who\r\ndurst not rise in their places and insist on having liberty to propose\r\nwhat their consciences dictated; and who, when refused that liberty,\r\ninstead of declining to take part in the mock Council, went into a\r\ncaucus, and drew up a petition to the autocrat who had snatched away\r\ntheir rights.\r\n\r\nBut their position was very difficult. If they attempted in their\r\nplaces to speak on the matter, the fatal sentence fell upon them that\r\nwhat the Holy Father had decreed could not be discussed. What then\r\ncould they do but decline to take part in the Council? This would\r\nbe coming into direct collision with the Pope. The moral education\r\nof their lives had aimed at fixing in their own minds, and they, in\r\ntheir action upon others, had aimed at fixing in their minds, one\r\nconviction--that the crime exceeding and comprehending all others was\r\nto break with the Pope. They were so placed as to have no alternative\r\nbut either \"disobedience\" or the surrender of their individual and\r\ncollective rights. They seem, indeed, to have thought that it was\r\nrather a spirited proceeding to send in a petition.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Haynald of Hungary proposed that they should request the\r\nPope to divide the Fathers into eight national groups. This was\r\nsuggested with some idea of counter-balancing the fictitious majority\r\nmade up by titular bishops and vicars apostolic. Had one nation been\r\nallowed to balance another, the effect no doubt would have been\r\nconsiderable; but how these venerable men could imagine that this\r\nscheme had any chance with the Pope, we cannot tell. The bishops _in\r\npartibus_, and the missionary bishops, being mostly Italians, would\r\nhave been well nigh lost in such an arrangement. The Curia well knew\r\nthat it had been tried at Constance, and was not to be caught.\r\n\r\nWhat Friedrich heard of the opinions of the prelates as to the Draft\r\nDecrees, was unfavourable. Cardinal Rauscher was reported to have\r\nsaid that he would allow the paper to be read in his seminaries as\r\nthe work of a student, but that to propose it to a German Council\r\nwas too bad (p. 35). Many of the bishops said that its condemnations\r\nwere untimely, and that it was unworthy of the dignity of a General\r\nCouncil. It was said to be the work of the Jesuit Fathers Schrader and\r\nFranzelin; but instead of the latter, Kleutgen was often named. The\r\nDominicans spoke slightingly of it. The Bishop of Ascoli, a Carmelite,\r\nsaid he had only patience to get through half of it, and then he threw\r\nit away. Strossmayer said to Friedrich, Why must the Council at this\r\ntime of day pronounce condemnations as to squabbles heard of only in\r\nthe schools, and worn out even there? (p. 37). Kagerer told Friedrich\r\nthat the bishops had agreed not to tell their theologians what passed\r\nat their private meetings; on which Friedrich remarks that the bishops\r\nwere right, for the chaplains and secretaries by whom they were served\r\ncould not be properly described as theologians. He then gave a sigh\r\nfor Hefele. Meanwhile, he said, it was hard to listen to the talk of\r\nmen, like Kagerer, who had come up without preparation, who were not\r\nfurnished with books, and who drove a trade in theology by guesswork.\r\n\r\nMonsignor Nardi's hospitality to the German bishops had not a smooth\r\ncourse. After having met at his house for the greater part of December,\r\nwhen they alighted one night in the Piazza Campitelli, they found the\r\nservant of Cardinal Schwarzenberg posted there to send them back again.\r\nThe Cardinal had received from Nardi a request to be relieved of their\r\nfurther presence, giving so short notice that there was no means of\r\nmeeting the case but that of setting the servant to turn the bishops\r\naway from the door. Thenceforth they found a German host, Cardinal\r\nRauscher.[245]\r\n\r\nThe General Congregation of December 20, after learning the names\r\nchosen for the Permanent Committee on Faith, had been occupied with the\r\nelection of the Permanent Committee on Discipline; but as the _Acta_\r\ncontain no records of any transactions of the Congregations, beyond the\r\nbare lists of the committees elected by them, the strictly official\r\nmeans of ascertaining what passed are all but _nil_. The _Acta Sanctae\r\nSedis_ may be fairly considered as official in a looser sense; and it\r\nis strange how the brief but clear occasional notes of particulars\r\nwhich they contain, almost invariably confirm the profane writers\r\nin statements denied, or apparently denied, at the time by faithful\r\nones. Deputations, including among others Strossmayer, went hither and\r\nthither in search of a hall to meet in. Quirinus thought that the one\r\nin the Vatican by the Sistine Chapel would not be of good omen, on\r\naccount of the picture of St. Bartholomew's massacre. Had any real wish\r\nexisted to find a place in which seven hundred gentlemen might sit and\r\nspeak, it could easily have been done; but the wholesome exhalations\r\nfrom the tomb of St. Peter would not have been so potent anywhere else,\r\neven in Rome, as in the Vatican. One-third of the space in the hall was\r\nnow curtained off. The debates were to open on December 28, that is,\r\nafter twenty days had been lost.\r\n\r\nNews of the death of Cardinal Reisach destroyed the hope that his\r\ninfluence might prevent the Germans from standing with the Opposition.\r\nThe preparations for a code regulating civil and ecclesiastical\r\nrelations, on which he had spent years, were not to see the light.\r\nIt had already been resolved not to present to the Council the Drafts\r\nprepared by his Commission on Ecclesiastico-Political Affairs. Cecconi\r\n(p. 266) thinks that probably the absence of the Cardinal \"contributed\r\nto the shipwreck\" of his proposals. The subject was \"thorny\"; and\r\nagain, it was not decorous to make inoperative laws, or expedient\r\nto make combative ones. It would seem that the supreme cause of\r\nthe shipwreck was the practical consideration that nowadays civil\r\ngovernments, \"which form an essential element in such matters,\" oppose\r\necclesiastical laws, instead of taking charge of their execution. The\r\nofficial historian, however, is of opinion that the failure of this\r\nfirst attempt to indite a code of ecclesiastico-political law is not\r\nfinal. A time, he thinks, may come when it can be renewed, with hope of\r\nsuccess--a declaration full of instruction as to the future. The time\r\nfor renewing the attempt to prepare such a code will, according to the\r\nArchbishop of Florence,\r\n\r\n    arrive when this rapid and ceaseless movement, political and\r\n    social, going on under our eyes, and making us daily spectators\r\n    of great and often of unlooked-for events, shall have reached its\r\n    ultimate period, to which will certainly succeed (unless the last\r\n    days succeed) an entirely new era in the history of the human\r\n    species. When that day comes, I know not what portion of the old\r\n    institutions will remain standing; but sure I am that one of\r\n    them will have survived, though peradventure externally bruised\r\n    and lacerated. She alone will be mistress of the field that day,\r\n    and the princes (if indeed the sound of that name will still be\r\n    heard), but certainly the nations, having then, after long and\r\n    cruel experience, made up their minds that out of her there is no\r\n    well-being, either in this life or beyond the tomb, will demand\r\n    from her the laws of tranquil repose, together with the earnest of\r\n    eternal happiness (p. 301).\r\n\r\nThis language is the more significant as having been written since\r\nthe war in 1870, and even since the outbreak in Germany of imperial\r\nresistance to the movement for priestly domination. With regard to\r\nprinces, it seems to breathe the threat which was screeched out by the\r\nJesuit organs in 1869 and 1870, that if they were not to sink in the\r\ncoming struggle, they must make peace with the Church.\r\n\r\nAs to the nations and the laws of the Church, it adroitly represents\r\nthe nations, not as submitting to receive the law at her dictation, but\r\nas demanding from her the laws which give repose. The ever-recurring\r\nalternative of submission or disturbance, if not destruction, is\r\nsmoothly but gravely put. Still, the historian seems as if he wrote\r\nthus rather by official duty than by personal impulse. But, like all\r\nthe \"inspired\" writers, he takes it for granted that the Church holds\r\nthe \"repose\" of nations in her power. Cardinals count on the effect\r\nof thorns planted in the pillows of statesmen. They know how to teach\r\nprinciples that form a people within the nation ready to obey a foreign\r\nword of command, and they know how and when to give the word. They\r\nalways--so say men in Italy--know how to find an Ahithophel, and how a\r\nDelilah!\r\n\r\nFears were often expressed lest an attempt should be made on December\r\n28 to carry Papal infallibility by acclamation. The bishops, however,\r\nseem to have had backbone enough to determine upon a formal protest\r\nshould this occur. Friedrich tells how those dignitaries who make\r\nlittle of denouncing the laws of their respective countries were\r\nvery anxious in Rome to find some mode of giving expression to their\r\ncomplaints and desires without printing, which in the Model State they\r\ndurst not do.\r\n\r\nHe also states that on the day before the opening of the discussion the\r\nPope was greatly depressed. It may have been a diplomatic depression.\r\nWhat bishop could be so heartless as to make speeches that would weigh\r\non the spirit of the Holy Father, and in fact to call in question\r\nDraft Decrees prepared by his authority and proposed in his name?\r\nWhat bishop, by obstructing their adoption, could occasion a risk\r\nthat the day fixed by Decree for the second session should arrive\r\nwithout any Decree being ready? One of Friedrich's statements, which,\r\nbefore Cecconi published, seemed the most improbable of all, was that\r\nCardinal Bilio, the President of the Preparatory Commission on Dogma,\r\nhad reckoned on the Draft being carried with scarcely any discussion.\r\nMuch as we knew of the displacement of the idea of conviction by that\r\nof submission, this statement seemed too monstrous. But the Archbishop\r\nof Florence appears unconscious of anything strange in the case. If\r\nItalian novelists and journalists, with whom the indifference of the\r\nnational mind to religion is a favourite idea, had combined to give\r\nan illustration of that indifference, they could hardly have invented\r\nanything so expressive. A Cardinal taking it for granted that seven\r\nhundred bishops could hastily adopt for ever as doctrine binding upon\r\nthemselves, their successors, and their Churches, a considerable\r\nwork, every single phrase of which any serious man would weigh before\r\nhe accepted it for his own creed, but would weigh ten times more\r\ncarefully before he imposed it upon others--before he took it upon\r\nhis soul to curse all who did not accept it, and to declare them cut\r\noff from the kingdom of God! Yet it is plain that not only Bilio, but\r\nthe Curia generally, expected the passing of the Draft as almost a\r\nmatter of course. In their minds the idea of submission to the Papal\r\nauthority had first displaced, and then completely replaced, the idea\r\nof religious conviction.\r\n\r\nThe first Vatican Decree passed after the Council had been declared\r\nopen, fixed the feast of Epiphany (January 6) as the day of the\r\nsecond session, in the expectation that this Draft, or a portion of\r\nit, would by that time have been adopted. But, like the first Vatican\r\nappointment, the first Vatican Decree had been not ratified in heaven.\r\nThe _Civiltá_ said (VII. ix. 227), \"As the discussion on the Draft\r\nproposed is not terminated, no Decrees will be published in the second\r\nsession.\" The _Acta Sanctae Sedis_ curtly wrote, \"No Decree was\r\npublished because none was ready.\"[246]\r\n\r\nMeantime the relative attitudes of the Council and of the Catholic\r\ngovernments had become more clearly defined. Following France, and\r\nrejecting the view of Bavaria and Portugal, the governments had\r\ndetermined not to interfere. Portugal had sent to her minister his\r\ncredentials as ambassador to the Council, but finding that he should be\r\nalone, Count Lavradio did not present them. France, which for the last\r\nten years had been abused by the Papal organs, was now loudly praised.\r\nEven M. Veuillot said that she was more liberal and more Christian than\r\nthe other nations, for her bayonets were at Civitá Vecchia to restrain\r\nthe violence of the Italians, and God would not forget it to her. True,\r\nFrench statesmen every now and then did show some apprehension as to\r\nwhat might come to pass if every child in France should learn in his\r\ncatechism that the Pope was infallible, and if most of them should grow\r\nup under teachers who would gently show how the Modern State rebelled\r\nagainst the divine constitution of the world as implied in that\r\nfundamental truth, for the government of the nations. It was even said\r\nthat Darboy plainly declared that should infallibility be proclaimed,\r\nthe French troops would no longer remain in the Papal States. However\r\nthat might have been, all that fell from the inspired pens was pervaded\r\nwith quiet reliance on France. It seemed as if the writers believed\r\nthat, just then, events depended more on one Spanish lady, in the\r\nTuileries, than on all the Frenchmen in Paris and the departments.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that the compliance with the wishes of the Curia\r\nshown by politicians, was repaid by a milder attitude. The new Bull,\r\ntechnically called _Apostolicae Sedis_, popularly called the new _In\r\nCoena Domini_, was menacing. The grave _Civiltá_ (VII. ix. 134) said--\r\n\r\n    Whom would the people obey? God and the Church, or the State?... As\r\n    it is evident that the Church assembled in Council can only repeat,\r\n    and that more strongly than ever, that as between God and men,\r\n    as between the Church and the State, obedience is to be rendered\r\n    to God and the Church instead of to man and the State, and as it\r\n    is evident that in Catholic and civilized countries, in spite of\r\n    all the efforts of sects, respect for the Church endures, and\r\n    increases, while all respect for States and governments diminishes,\r\n    it is clear that the Liberals, who are dominant almost everywhere,\r\n    tremble at the Council, which is bound to proclaim more loudly than\r\n    ever, We must obey God rather than men.\r\n\r\nEven the little review at the Villa Borghese set M. Veuillot reflecting\r\non the restoration of that \"Christian order\" which consists in the due\r\nsubmission of the natural to the supernatural order--\r\n\r\n    If we only think that the Council has to re-establish the Christian\r\n    order without restoring the ancient aristocracy, irremediably\r\n    fallen, and has to replace the social laws in a position where\r\n    property and liberty shall be freed from the grasp of democracy,\r\n    which is no more than an administrative aristocracy, we shall\r\n    conclude that the task is not a trifle, and that the seed to be\r\n    sown is not of a kind to ripen in a day.\r\n\r\nIn most Papal countries, indeed, the ancient aristocracy has fallen,\r\nand, much as priests like titles and stars in their train, they like\r\nbroad acres still better, and legislative power even better still. Even\r\nwhen barons held lands in fief under prince-bishops and abbots, they\r\nwere frequently tempted to insubordination. And in the Model State,\r\nthe career open to a lord was as nearly as possible that which in our\r\nchaotic state is open to a lady. So, the aristocracy were not to be\r\nrestored. But in the new Christian order both freedom and property\r\nwere to be taken out of the hands of the democracy. This had been well\r\ndone in the states of the Church, and partly done elsewhere, in the\r\nmiddle ages. In the formula, \"The Pope and the People,\" people does\r\nnot, we repeat, mean democracy, but subject populace, with a ruling\r\npriesthood and nobody to come between priest and mob. Matters would\r\nbe greatly simplified if both an aristocracy and an administrative\r\ndemocracy were removed out of the way. But, true to the far-aiming\r\nplans of the school, M. Veuillot was thinking of the seed-time, knowing\r\nthat the harvest was as yet far off. When the prize is no less than the\r\nsupremacy of the world, a year may well be counted for a day.\r\n\r\nM. Veuillot, alluding to those profane creatures the correspondents\r\nof worldly newspapers, said he had had to do with government spies,\r\nbut Press spies made him respect the former. The Press spies detested\r\nrespectable men, seeming to think that they spoiled the profession, and\r\nprevented it from enjoying all the hatred and contempt it merited (i.\r\n33). M. Veuillot could afford to assume this attitude. The _Univers_\r\nwas sanctified by the Pope's blessing, and certified by his brief. This\r\nhigh-caste scribe had not, however, said a word about the device by\r\nwhich the election of committees had been carried, though he gloried\r\nin the choice of men. He had not mentioned the electoral tickets,\r\nnor alluded to the prohibition of collective meetings of the French\r\nbishops, nor to the petition sent in by some of their number for a few\r\nmorsels of liberty. He had, however, told the faithful that none of the\r\nbishops had any desire to be put on the committees, and that a prelate\r\nfrom South America, on finding himself elected, wept and said, \"What do\r\nyou mean? I am not fit. I know nothing.\" Writing on January 20, after\r\nthe division of parties had become clearly defined, M. Veuillot said\r\nthat should an Opposition group be formed, as some feared would be\r\nthe case, it would only be small, and would be rather outside of the\r\nCouncil than in it. \"Outside,\" said a bishop to me yesterday, \"there\r\nis some room for the spirit of man; inside there will be no room for\r\nanything but the Spirit of God; and though unanimity is by no means\r\nnecessary, it will nevertheless seldom fail.\" It was, at this time,\r\nstill hoped that the \"pontifical secret\" would leave no chink by which\r\nthe tenor of the debates could leak out. \"How,\" exclaims M. Veuillot,\r\n\"will this assembly be able to distribute its incalculable labours, and\r\ncarry them to an end? Immense questions arise on all sides. It is the\r\nhuman species that has to be set in march. Nature feels its infirmity.\"\r\nStill, it will prove, he asserts, that the Council can more easily make\r\ndecrees for centuries, than modern governments can make constitutions\r\nto last a few months.\r\n\r\nAn address to the Holy Father, from the Society of Catholic Italian\r\nyouth having its headquarters in Bologna, declared that in answer\r\nto the infernal fury of the enemies of the sacred Council, they\r\nprotested their resolution to obey its Decrees as the holy gospel,\r\nas the decrees of God Himself, and to defend its disciplinary acts\r\nas the acts of God Himself. In conclusion, they call the Pope, among\r\nother titles, the living Peter, the infallible mouth of the Church\r\nand of Christ Himself, the Vicar of God, \"whose word for us and the\r\nCatholic universe is the truth of God which endureth for ever.\"[247]\r\nA strong force of equally well-trained youths in every country would\r\ndo something to give substance to the dream of universal empire, by a\r\nCrusade of St. Peter.\r\n\r\nTo say that the _Civiltá_ and the _Unitá Cattolica_ contradicted nearly\r\nall the facts reported by the journals of Europe, would be a tame\r\nstatement of the case. They not only gave the lie, but did so with all\r\nsorts of aggravating epithets. The Italian papers were most belied,\r\nbecause they, feeling no respect for the men of the Curia, did not\r\ncare to put on any, but tore off false covers relentlessly, and even\r\nwith mockery. According to an ordinary Italian saying, respect for the\r\nCuria begins outside the walls of Rome, and increases in proportion\r\nto distance. Still, the French, German, and English papers, though\r\nmore respectful--the last, in comparison, deferential--were denounced\r\nas lying and lying again. This went smoothly till the lie-givers\r\ndescended to particulars. Even then it answered, to some extent,\r\ntill time brought facts to the test. Now, it is sad to look at these\r\ncontradictions, and compare them with documents registered in the\r\nsame pages, or with facts which even there are no longer disputed.\r\nAny one who wants a lesson in the art of giving the lie may go to an\r\narticle in the _Civiltá_ (VII. ix. p. 327), and succeeding ones. After\r\nstudying them an Englishman would be more charitable to Romans when\r\nthey say that if the Jesuits contradict a thing well, they begin to\r\nthink it must be true. But he would discover that, under an apparent\r\ncontradiction, there is often preserved a possibility of saying that\r\nthere was no real one. A statement has been made containing one main\r\nfact, which was perfectly true, but with two or three accidental\r\nappendages, some one of which was not true, and the whole is treated\r\nas false. For instance, the whole tale of Nardi dismissing the German\r\nprelates is to appearance ridiculed, because one journal says that\r\nNardi had made a secret door, at which he played the eavesdropper. Of\r\ncourse it was an Italian journal--_La Nazione_--which thought that a\r\nprobable action for a monsignore of the Curia.\r\n\r\nThe _Nuova Antologia_, a review of high standing in Italy, published\r\narticles on the Council, which formed the basis of Vitelleschi's book.\r\nThe _Civiltá_ assigned them to Salvatore de Renzi, spoke of them as\r\nbeing not more inaccurate than others, and after general charges came\r\nto particulars. The author's \"want of reflection\" appeared in his\r\nsupposing that though abbots and generals of orders both had seats,\r\nonly the former had votes. Moreover, he had said that in the sessions\r\nthe Fathers always wore the read pluvial and mitre; whereas in the\r\nfirst two sessions they had worn the white ones, and the statement as\r\nto the mitre was _falsissimo_, as false as could be, for in Rome, and\r\nin the presence of the Pope, they always wore one of white silk or\r\ncloth. When all Catholics were in serious excitement, when they knew\r\nthat hands were laid on their creed to alter it for them and their\r\nchildren, it was such matters as the above which weighed upon the minds\r\nof the Jesuits, and justified outcry against men who strove to get and\r\ngive some little information.\r\n\r\nThe first article of professed intelligence in the _Civiltá_ after the\r\nCouncil had really got to work, spoke of giving only the _external_\r\nnews, which was what all the \"good Press\" professed to give. What it\r\ngave was indeed external. A person turning to these official pages\r\nin hope of learning what he would have to believe by-and-by, found\r\nparagraphs about \"clothes\" (VII. ix. 99). \"We have told our readers\r\nof the vestments worn by the Fathers in the public session. They\r\nwill be pleased to have a translation of the notice appointing the\r\nceremony to be observed in the Congregations\"--the ceremony meaning the\r\nceremonial garments. The men who were undertaking to change for the\r\npriests and people the conditions of their membership in the Church, to\r\nrevolutionize their relations with their neighbours and even with their\r\nnations, were yet persuaded that while all this was going on, priests\r\nand people must be thinking of how the gowns of the Fates were dyed,\r\nand not of what threads they were spinning. So, with conscientious\r\nexactness, the faithful were informed that the Most Reverend and Most\r\nEminent Lords the Cardinals would wear the red and violet mozzetta\r\nand mantelletta over the rochet; and the Most Reverend Patriarchs the\r\nviolet mozzetta and rochet, etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\nA touching incident of private life came to soften the feelings of\r\nthe Fathers on the eve of the struggle. The son of De Maistre, the\r\nchampion of the pen, and the daughter of Lamoricière, the champion of\r\nthe sword, had, four months previously, been married. \"Two such fair\r\nnames,\" exclaims M. Veuillot--yes, two stately figures, bending in vain\r\nto stay a falling oak. The young wife was smitten with death, and the\r\nwidow of the hero could only reach Rome in time to close her daughter's\r\neyes. The whole city united in sorrowing over the mingled tears of the\r\nhouses of De Maistre and Lamoricière. Noble Lamoricière! During the\r\nfour dreadful days of June, 1848, in Paris, his chivalrous sword formed\r\na shield behind which thousands sat in safety. None who were of the\r\nnumber, as we were, can ever without gratitude think of him, or of the\r\nstainless Cavaignac.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 238: _Documenta ad Illustrandum_, i. 245.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: Of those domestic prelates the _Annuario Pontificio_ for\r\n1870 gives above two hundred and thirty names; the list in 1875 is over\r\nfour hundred, in the _Gerarchia Cattolica e la Famiglia Pontificia_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 240: Though issued during the Council, this Bull is not, like\r\nthe others, printed in the _Acta_.

That once done, minor points would settle themselves,\r\nwhether in the Council or out of it. The fears of a scheme to organize\r\nan acclamation were strong, not to say feverish. Cardinal Schwarzenberg\r\nwrote, \"In case a demonstration is attempted for an acclamation, a\r\nformal counter demonstration is already provided for.\"[248] Before the\r\ncommencement of the sitting, Cardinal De Luca, now Senior President,\r\ngave an assurance that no acclamation would be attempted; adding,\r\nhowever, that he could only give the pledge for that one sitting.\r\nStrossmayer, relating this fact the next day, in the house of Cardinal\r\nHohenlohe, added that, should it be attempted hereafter, the bishops\r\nof the minority would put in a protest, in the name of Christ, of the\r\nChurch, of their rights, of their people, and of sound reason.[249]\r\n\r\nLord Acton's picture of the scene before the sitting is more distinct\r\nthan that of the other writers. It is Darboy whom he describes as\r\ndemanding an assurance that there would be no acclamation. When the\r\npromise for the first sitting was coupled with a statement that there\r\ncould be no guarantee for the future, he said a hundred bishops were\r\nresolved, in case that proceeding was resorted to, that they would\r\nleave Rome, and \"carry the Council away in their shoes.\"[250]\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty which had hung over everything but dress was so great\r\nthat some prelates had prepared their votes, thinking that, owing\r\nto the determination to have some Decree ready for promulgation at\r\nEpiphany, a division would be pressed on that day.[251]\r\n\r\nIn print, the tribune, or desk, prepared for the Council, is a\r\nlaudable specimen of Roman art. To look at, it is what we must call a\r\ncommonplace pulpit. It was carried from place to place--more than one\r\nwriter says, carried all round the hall--to try to find a spot in which\r\nit would be possible for a speaker to be heard. When the desk was at\r\nlast fixed, two priests, as reporters, took their place in front of\r\nit.[252] Cardinal Rauscher, Archbishop of Vienna, was the first who\r\nascended. Behind him he saw his own achievement--that Concordat by\r\nwhich he had secured for Rome the abolition in Austria of the Josephine\r\nLaws. Before him lay the Draft of Decrees, for the most part, as it was\r\nbelieved, the handiwork of Schrader, whom he had himself installed as a\r\nprofessor in the University of Vienna, and who was doubtless a fit man\r\nto make it what it was--a dogmatic reflection of the earliest portions\r\nof the Syllabus. The sagacity of Rauscher told him that the success of\r\nthese proposed Decrees would be the doom of the Concordat. Hence, he\r\nrose, not to support the theology of his nominee, but to save his own\r\ndiplomatic achievement.\r\n\r\nSo the discussion opened with a brilliant address, as Friedrich calls\r\nit, delivered in the round, rough Latin pronunciation of the Germans.\r\nDarboy soon left the hall, saying that it was undignified to sit\r\nprofessedly listening to speeches which one could not make out. What\r\nwith the mocking of the echoes and what with the pronunciation foreign\r\nto all but Germans, none could understand but the few in whose favour\r\ncombined all the advantages of keen ears, a good position, and some\r\nfamiliarity with German intonation.\r\n\r\nAll that we know of the discourse of Cardinal Rauscher has become known\r\nin spite of the silence of every official organ; and it amounts to no\r\nmore than the fact that he opposed the Draft Decrees with firmness and\r\nability. The strict Church régime assured by his Concordat to Austria\r\nhad not been followed by the halcyon days which such a régime was said\r\nto guarantee. Loud complaints were made that the moral statistics\r\nof Vienna, previously very bad, had, under the new law of marriage,\r\nbecome worse. However that might be, there was no doubt that under the\r\nConcordat Austria had undergone both Solferino and Sadowa. If, after\r\nall this, new fetters were to be forged, Rauscher was well aware that\r\nthe chain would snap.\r\n\r\nAfter Cardinals, Archbishops! So the Irish-Latin of Archbishop Kenrick,\r\nof St. Louis, succeeded to the German-Latin of Rauscher. The voice from\r\nthe Mississippi joined that from the Danube in making light of the\r\ntheological performance of Rome. The next who followed was Tizzani,\r\nnominally Archbishop of Nisibis, really Chaplain-General of the Papal\r\narmy. A blind old man, he did not mount the desk, but, speaking from\r\nhis place, he was the first who gave forth the Latin in the clear,\r\nfull pronunciation, which must be nearer to the natural one than the\r\nothers. He said that the Draft was words, words, and nothing but words.\r\nThree other Italians followed on the same side. It was still the turn\r\nof the Archbishops; and Connolly, of Halifax, Nova Scotia, closed\r\nthe discussion of the day. There are two versions of his concluding\r\ninnuendo. One is, that the Draft was to be honourably interred; and\r\nthe other, that it was not to be amended but erased. _Cum honore esse\r\nsepeliendum ... non esse reformandum censeo sed delendum._ Fourteen\r\nnames had been entered, but when seven had spoken, it was one o'clock,\r\nand the weary work of attempting to hear was brought to an end. The\r\nold men had been already four hours in the hall.\r\n\r\nThe _Giornale di Roma_ and the _Civiltá_ gave the names of the\r\nspeakers, but not a syllable of information as to what they said. The\r\nsame course was taken by all the \"good Press.\" It professed to give\r\ninformation only of the exterior of the Council. Even the _Acta Sanctæ\r\nSedis_, in its Latin veil, does not utter a hint of what view any\r\nspeaker took. It does, indeed, say that no one replied to observations\r\nfor, against, or beside the proposals of the Decree, thus confirming\r\nthe common remark that there was no real debate.[253] Among all the\r\ncharges of lying, shameless lying, lurid lying, and so on, brought\r\nagainst the lay Press, we do not remember any attempt to contradict\r\nthe particulars circulated as to this day's proceedings, unless indeed\r\nit be Cardinal Manning's general treatment of all that had been said\r\nrespecting an intention to get up an acclamation, as ridiculous rumours.\r\n\r\nCardinal Bilio, as President of the Commission on Dogma, from which\r\nthe Draft had emanated, would naturally be, as Friedrich says he was,\r\ndowncast; and we may well believe the same witness, that the Cardinals\r\ngenerally were disconcerted. On the other hand, Cardinal Schwarzenberg\r\nsaid, \"It has gone excellently\"; and Archbishop Scherr, of Munich,\r\nthought that it was as if one had heard \"the rushing of the wings of\r\nthe Holy Ghost\"--one of the expressions in which that sacred name was\r\noften lightly taken during the Council, and which, from hints found\r\nelsewhere, seems to have fallen on this occasion also from other lips.\r\nStrossmayer was by no means so elated, knowing that the Curia was in a\r\nposition to hold its own.\r\n\r\nThis discussion raised the spirits of the minority, and filled them\r\nfor a while with illusory hopes. It seemed as if the one liberty left,\r\nthat of making Latin speeches, might turn to great account. Meanwhile,\r\naccording to Lord Acton, speculation ran on the possible effects of\r\nfifteen vacant hats, which were supposed to have the power of doing\r\nwonders, and which the genuine Romans would certainly expect to turn\r\nepiscopal heads in whatever direction they might happen to be held.\r\nDarboy said, \"I have not a cold in the head: I do not want a hat.\"\r\n\r\nQuirinus points out the bearing of such multiplication of anathemas\r\nas was aimed at in the Draft on the ascendancy of the Jesuits. These\r\nanathemas would supply abundant matter for accusation, and so enable\r\nthe Jesuits to keep men belonging to other orders in constant fear of\r\nbeing charged with heresy. This would tend to make other theologians\r\ndependent upon their order. He adds, moreover, that if the Draft\r\nDecrees should be passed, scarcely any professors of Old Testament\r\nexegesis would escape the charge of heresy.\r\n\r\nTwo days later the debate was resumed. The archbishops were still in\r\npossession; but after one more of them had spoken came the turn of\r\nthe bishops. Rank carried it against the rule that in council all are\r\nequal. Athanasius the deacon, and Constantine the layman, were both\r\noutside the door. And outside the door were also the \"presbyters\"\r\nwho alone at Nicæa represented Rome. Unity had come to mean a sharp\r\nseparation of the Church into the _Teaching Church_ and the _Learning\r\nChurch_. The _Teaching Church_ consisted of the Pope and bishops; the\r\n_Learning Church_ consisted of priests and people.\r\n\r\nThose who desired to speak entered their names at least one day\r\nbeforehand; and of those so entered Cardinals spoke first, Patriarchs\r\nnext, then Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, and Generals, according to\r\ntheir grade.\r\n\r\nThe first bishop who rose was Strossmayer. As he had before attempted\r\nto speak upon the Rules, so did he now attack the heading of the\r\nDecree, namely, the formula \"Pius IX., with the approbation of the\r\nCouncil,\" instead of the Tridentine formula, \"This Sacred Council\r\ndecrees.\" He was called to order by Cardinal De Luca. That point, he\r\nruled, was not to be discussed, for it had been settled in the Rules\r\nof Procedure, and also in the form used in the opening session. No\r\none supported Strossmayer in his objection, and, in point of form,\r\nthe President was doubtless right. The bishops had allowed their\r\nbirthright to be taken away, and it was now too late to reclaim it.\r\nTrue, if they had been united, they might have alleged that the taking\r\nof it away had been done both violently and stealthily; but still, it\r\nhad been done before their eyes.\r\n\r\nStrossmayer's speech gave to modern Rome a sensation strange to her,\r\nthough familiar to ancient Rome--the feeling caused by the echoes\r\nof impassioned reasoning in favour of freedom. And this time it was\r\nfreedom commended by the voice of a bishop! The degree of freedom\r\nadvocated was, indeed, only such as anywhere else would have been\r\na minimum. The reports given of the eloquence of the speaker were\r\nexciting, and it would appear that even those of opponents were often\r\nlaudatory. Lord Acton gives the following passage--\r\n\r\n    What do we gain by condemning what has been already condemned?\r\n    What end is promoted by proscribing errors which we know to have\r\n    been already proscribed? The false doctrines of sophists have\r\n    vanished like ashes before the wind. They have corrupted many, I\r\n    confess, and infected the spirit of the age. But can we believe\r\n    that the contagion of corruption would not have taken effect had\r\n    errors of this sort been smitten down with anathema, by Decree?\r\n    We have no means given to us beyond cries and prayers to God,\r\n    whereby to defend and conserve the Catholic religion, but those\r\n    of Catholic science in complete agreement with the faith. The\r\n    heretics assiduously cultivate science unfriendly to the faith, and\r\n    therefore true science friendly to it should be cultivated among\r\n    Catholics, and advanced by every effort. Let us stop the mouth of\r\n    opponents, who cease not falsely to impute to us that the Catholic\r\n    Church represses science, and restrains all free thought, so that\r\n    within her bounds neither science nor any liberty of intellect\r\n    can flourish or exist. Further, it has to be shown, and that both\r\n    by words and deeds, that in the Catholic Church there exist true\r\n    liberty for the nations, true progress, true light, and true\r\n    prosperity.[254]\r\n\r\nThis proposal to fight thought only with thought, and to allow\r\ninstitutions to be tested by their fruits, was well fitted for any soil\r\nwhere the Bible was the statute-book, but was untenable ground in Rome.\r\nThe excitement was great.\r\n\r\nKetteler embraced Strossmayer as he came down. Senestrey, on the other\r\nhand, stated that he had said things for which he must have been called\r\nto order in any assembly. Dinkle said he had spoken on his own account,\r\nand showed no inclination to share risks with him.\r\n\r\nThe first French prelate who came to the desk was Ginoulhiac, of\r\nGrenoble, who also spoke against the Draft. What he then said we know\r\nnot. What he had just previously published under his own hand we do\r\nknow. Resisting the idea of an acclamation, he said--\r\n\r\n    To insist upon dispensing with previous examination, because of the\r\n    immense importance of the question, or because the subject of the\r\n    question was that which in the Church is greatest, would be not\r\n    merely to depart from the practice of all ages, but it would also\r\n    be to commit a most serious error, and to awaken in all grave minds\r\n    just suspicions of the decision which might be arrived at. In past\r\n    times nothing was so feared as the appearance of not devoting to\r\n    important decisions sufficient time, and of not giving sufficient\r\n    satisfaction even to the minds of the prejudiced (p. 43).\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the liberty essential to a real Council, he had said (p.\r\n46)--\r\n\r\n    Little does it matter whether the liberty of deliberation and of\r\n    vote be violated in one way or another, whether by fear or by\r\n    guile, whether the violence exerted is physical or moral; so soon\r\n    as liberty is gravely hampered, the Church no longer recognizes\r\n    herself as truly represented.\r\n\r\nFriedrich tells how Strossmayer, the day before, had said that he\r\nwould write out his speech and send it in; for the reporters were so\r\nunskilful that their manuscripts were of little use. But we do not see\r\nhow he could do more than guess what their reports were. At the same\r\ntime (it was in the house of Cardinal Hohenlohe), he said that now,\r\nsince he had been in Rome, he could understand how both the Reformation\r\nand the Greek Schism had originated. It was in his view a real crime\r\nfor the Pope to claim to be the successor of Christ instead of the\r\nsuccessor of Peter; the way in which bishops were driven was, he\r\nadded, inconceivable, when one remembered that it was they that kept\r\nup the dignity of the Pope, and prepared the minds of the people to\r\nacknowledge it.\r\n\r\nA prelate of different views was he to whom Friedrich had said that,\r\nin order to understand the events of the Council, one must read\r\nthe _Civiltá_, further adding that had he been Prince Hohenlohe\r\nin Bavaria, he would have answered the _Civiltá_ by expelling the\r\nJesuits from Regensburg. \"They are innocent people,\" said the Bishop.\r\n\"Individually,\" replied the Professor, \"they may be innocent people,\r\nbut they represent an order which propagates doctrine dangerous\r\nto the State.\" He tells also how it was found that the French,\r\nGerman, Austro-Hungarian, and American bishops had an International\r\nCommittee of three; but that the Pope, regarding this as savouring of\r\nNationalism, and of a revolutionary spirit, forbade it. Lord Acton (p.\r\n52) mentions another prohibition scarcely less significant, namely,\r\nthat the printed Rules of Procedure of the Council of Trent were,\r\nwith the utmost strictness, withheld from the members of the Vatican\r\nCouncil. These rules, and the real minutes of that Council, had at\r\nthat time never been published, and only saw the light in 1874, by\r\nthe private efforts of Theiner. Of course, the Decrees and Canons had\r\nlong been before the world. Among the many denials we do not remember\r\nany attempt to deny this specific allegation. An argument could be\r\neasily constructed, on the principle now accepted, to prove that it was\r\nno interference with liberty to deprive the bishops of the physical\r\npossibility of informing themselves of the extent of rights which they\r\nhad inherited from their predecessors at the latest General Council.\r\n\r\nLord Acton says that one effect of the determination to keep the\r\ndiscussions secret was that it led the bishops to express themselves\r\nmore strongly than they would have done had they expected their\r\nwords to be read at home and conned over by Protestants. At the same\r\ntime, much leaked out. All agree that the inhabitants of Rome took\r\nlittle interest in the discussions, while, in the religious aspect\r\nof the question, the Italians generally took scarcely any; and this\r\nindifference reacted on the interest they might have taken in its\r\npolitical aspects. They committed the error of despising their enemy.\r\nKnowing the men and their communications, they allowed their own\r\nestimate of the worth of priests to affect their calculation as to\r\ntheir influence.\r\n\r\nThere is a well accredited story of Lord Acton going to Florence, full\r\nof the burning questions which were to affect the future of every Roman\r\nCatholic. Dining with a relation in the very centre of the political\r\ncircle, and meeting several members of the Cabinet, he naturally\r\nexpected to find them taking some interest in the cosmopolitan politics\r\nthen under treatment by the Senate of Humanity, the Supreme Legislature\r\nof the Human Species. But the Italians were buried in some passing\r\nquestion of grist, or the like, and had no ear for the principles\r\nwhich were to shape the future of nations. They saw little in the\r\nproceedings more than that the Pundits of an expiring caste were\r\npassing resolutions to adjourn the nineteenth century and to conserve\r\nthe eleventh.\r\n\r\nGerman and English Catholics were not capable of thus treating\r\nprinciples as husks. Whether Fallibilists or Infallibilists, they\r\nknew that the destiny of that Society, which both agreed to call \"The\r\nChurch,\" was now at stake, and that, at least, the repose of nations,\r\nif not their destiny, was also implicated. The Liberal Catholics,\r\nholding that the attempt to restore a theocracy would only lead to\r\nwars, and that humanity would avenge itself on the Papacy for again\r\nfomenting bloodshed, hoped that somehow God would save the Church from\r\nthe blindness of the Curia. The Catholics, on the other hand, equally\r\naiming at _ultimate_ peace, and even regaling their imaginations\r\nwith a vision of millennial repose, so soon as all nations should\r\nhave accepted the Vicegerent of God as the representative of Christ\r\nHimself, were in the meantime profoundly convinced that the only way\r\nto obtain that repose was through the very conflict from which their\r\nfaint-hearted brethren shrank.\r\n\r\nThe Infallibilists could not harbour the idea of the Church failing in\r\nthe struggle. That was to them like supposing that the gates of hell\r\nshould prevail. To the Liberal Catholics the Jesuits were conspiring\r\nagainst humanity and all its franchises. To the Jesuits, on the other\r\nhand, the Liberal Catholics seemed to be risking the loss of such an\r\nopportunity as might never recur, of putting the Church in a position\r\nto constrain governments to accept the principles by which alone\r\nnations could be saved. Therefore did they look upon any shrinking from\r\nthe struggle as indicating worldly fear rather than foreseeing care for\r\nthe Church. If Liberal Catholics looked upon the Jesuits as conspiring\r\nagainst humanity, the Jesuits looked upon the Liberal Catholics as\r\nagitators against divine authority. No wonder that in such a state of\r\nfeeling, what Lord Acton describes took place, \"The word-war of the\r\nhall was always fought over and over again outside, with the addition\r\nof anecdotes, epigrams, and inventions.\"\r\n\r\nIt was on Sunday, January 2, that two petitions were sent in to the\r\nPope. The first was signed by forty-three prelates, headed by Cardinals\r\nSchwarzenberg and Rauscher, and the Primate of Hungary.[255] This was\r\nno Bill of Rights, not containing even a challenge of that exercise\r\nof prerogative which it sought partially to relax. The privileges for\r\nwhich two princes and forty-one magnates petitioned, \"prostrate at thy\r\nfeet,\" were--\r\n\r\n    (1) That the Fathers might be distributed into, say, six groups,\r\n    in which Draft Decrees could be considered in the principal living\r\n    languages before being brought on for discussion in Latin, in the\r\n    General Congregation. (2) That speeches delivered in the General\r\n    Congregation might be printed for the exclusive use of the members\r\n    of the Council, and under the same bond of secrecy as that under\r\n    which the Draft Decrees were communicated to them. (3) That the\r\n    Draft Decrees on faith and discipline might all as soon as possible\r\n    be laid in a connected form before the Fathers, and should not\r\n    any longer be presented, as hitherto, piecemeal. (4) That the\r\n    Fathers, after having in the vernacular meetings considered the\r\n    Draft Decrees, might be allowed to send a couple of delegates from\r\n    each group to the committee to represent their views. (5) That\r\n    the Fathers might be allowed to print, in addition to speeches\r\n    delivered in the General Congregation, writings in which questions\r\n    could be treated more thoroughly; these however to be printed\r\n    subject to the same bond of secrecy as the Draft Decrees. (6)\r\n    \"Prostrate at thy feet, we crave the apostolic benediction for\r\n    ourselves and the faithful committed to us.\"\r\n\r\nWe do not know that even the last of the six things here prayed\r\nfor was granted, for the petition never received an answer. These\r\ndignitaries clearly state to their royal master the grounds on which\r\nthey petitioned for some of the elementary rights of human creatures.\r\nThey say that Decrees cannot be really sifted by speaking a dead\r\nlanguage in an assembly of seven hundred persons from all parts of\r\nthe world, unless, first, in companies speaking living languages, the\r\nFathers have had the opportunity of examining their contents. And\r\nfurther, that however well acquainted with Latin all might be, there\r\nwere many prelates who did not speak it. Moreover, the petitioners,\r\nadmitting that the Council Hall was admirable as being so near the tomb\r\nof St. Peter, state that in the first General Congregation, though\r\nsome of the speakers had excellent voices, not one of them could\r\nmake himself heard by all. Even since changes had been effected, the\r\ngreater part of the members could not hear all the speakers. Another\r\nof their points is this: Although men well worthy of confidence--_viri\r\nfide dignissimi_--had assured them that the reports of the speeches\r\nshould be distributed to the Fathers in print, so that they might\r\nread what they had not been able to hear, \"in this hope we have been\r\ndisappointed.\"\r\n\r\nThey appeal thus to their master, \"Most Blessed Father, by thine\r\nexcelling wisdom, wilt thou perceive that, as the Fathers can\r\nneither hear what is spoken, nor read it, proper consultation is not\r\npossible.\"[256] They go on to urge that even if the discussions were\r\nheld in a place where men with the weakest voices could be heard, it\r\nwould still be desirable that the members should be in a position to\r\nlook over what had been advanced in successive sittings. \"Matters of\r\nweightiest moment,\" they add, \"are being treated, and frequently the\r\naddition, omission, or change of a single word may adulterate the\r\nsense.\" If, say they, the Fathers had the opportunity of explaining\r\ntheir views in writing, they could lay many things before their fellow\r\nmembers which could not be brought into speeches. As to obtaining an\r\nunderstanding of the proposals, they urged that, in questions of\r\ndoctrine, one thing so connects itself with another, and discipline\r\nis so much affected by doctrine, that they are not in any position\r\nto give a judgment on Draft Decrees, obviously forming but part of a\r\nscheme, while as yet other parts of it are kept from their knowledge.\r\nThe relation between the unknown parts and the parts before them is an\r\nelement in any judgment to be formed.\r\n\r\nThe second petition, dated on the same Sunday,[257] was signed by\r\ntwenty-six prelates, including several of those who had signed the\r\nother, and a few additional ones, such as Kenrick of St. Louis.\r\nCardinal Rauscher did not sign it, but Cardinal Schwarzenberg did.\r\nIt set out by indirectly asserting more in principle than the other;\r\nbut it ended by asking less in practice. It seemed both to assume the\r\nright of proposition on the part of the prelates, and to imply that\r\nthe taking of it away would deserve blame; but it had not the courage\r\nto say that it had been taken away. Those are not wanting, say the\r\npetitioners, who interpret the Rules as not recognizing the right of\r\nthe Fathers to propose in the Council what they may think conducive to\r\nthe public good, but as conceding it only exceptionally and as a matter\r\nof grace. This may be a diplomatic way of indicating what the Rules\r\nsaid without confessing the fact that they did say it. But what they\r\ndid say was too plain for any such finesse. The prayer of the petition\r\nis confined to two points: that some members of the Commission on\r\nProposals should be elected by the Committee, and that the authors of\r\nproposals should have access to the committees, and thus have some part\r\nin the treatment of the particular matter in which they were interested.\r\n\r\nThese petitions say more than all the assertions of the much\r\ncontradicted Liberal Catholics about the want of freedom in the\r\nCouncil, and the want of the old spirit of bishops in the men who\r\ncomposed it. According to Friedberg, the first of the two was drawn\r\nup by Cardinal Rauscher (xli.). No name of an English, Irish, or\r\nColonial prelate is attached to either petition. Nearly all the names\r\nare those of Germans and Hungarians, the only American one being\r\nthat of Kenrick. His signature proves that the English-speaking group\r\nknew of the petitions, and the absence of all other names belonging\r\nto that group would seem to indicate that members of the hierarchy\r\nfrom America, the British Isles, and our Colonies did not approve of\r\nbishops of their Church being entrusted with such extensive liberties\r\nas those for which their brethren petitioned. It is pretty certain that\r\nthe American archbishop who signed this petition was not one of the\r\nprelates who told the Archbishop of Westminster that their Congress\r\nwas not freer than the Council. Do senators and members of the House\r\nprostrate themselves at the feet of the President, petitioning for\r\nleave to meet in a place where they can hear and be heard, for leave\r\nto read reports of one another's speeches, and for leave to print\r\nmemoranda--for leave even to elect a few members of a committee which\r\ndecides what may and what may not be recommended to the President,\r\nto be proposed should he approve of it? If they do not, we must only\r\nbelieve that America sends some citizens to Europe whose information\r\nas to the institutions of their country is not to be relied upon. Did\r\nGinoulhiac, whose observations on the necessity of perfect freedom\r\nin a Council we have lately seen, consider legislators free who had\r\nto petition for such things? Outside of the number of Cardinals\r\nresident in Rome, could even a Cardinal have been found beforehand to\r\nassert that liberty would not be gravely hampered, in any legislative\r\nassembly, whenever those who were called legislators were compelled to\r\nindite petitions such as we have described? We doubt if even a resident\r\nCardinal would beforehand have dared in terms to deny that when, in a\r\nprofessed Council, liberty is gravely hampered, the Church does not\r\nrecognize herself as represented. Now, it is easy to turn the point of\r\nall such arguments. Peter the Infallible has only to say what rights\r\nJames and John, Thomas and Paul shall enjoy, and in exercising them\r\nthey possess all the freedom that God has been pleased to grant to them.\r\n\r\nThe allusion in the petition to the ease with which the sense of a\r\nspeech may be altered seems like a remark of Strossmayer, quoted by\r\nFriedrich, that reports which were under no check but that of the\r\nCuria, and which even the speakers themselves were not allowed to\r\ninspect, could not be of any use. To this Friedrich adds, How much\r\nwould the weight of the remark have been increased after an incident\r\non July 9, \"when the majority of the Council, and a committee of the\r\nCouncil, did not scruple formally to deceive the minority.\"\r\n\r\nThe prayer of the petitioners for a sight of the whole scheme, as\r\nprepared, before they should be called upon to erect part of it into\r\nirreformable Decrees, was doubtless caused in part by the obvious\r\nrelation between the Drafts already brought to light and the Syllabus.\r\nThat compendium was not mentioned any more than it had been in many\r\nother public instruments, but the first Draft fitted to its first\r\nsections, just as the Encyclical which accompanied its issue had done\r\nto the whole document. Notwithstanding its authority, its form made it\r\nof doubtful interpretation, and these Decrees aimed at giving statutory\r\nform to its sentences. An _Index Schematum_, or List of Drafts, had\r\ncome to light,[258] which let the bishops see that what had hitherto\r\nbeen produced was but the first instalment of projected legislation\r\ncovering all the ground occupied by the Syllabus. The first Draft\r\ntreated only the philosophical and theological portion of the subjects;\r\nbut how were the principles enunciated to be applied, when the sections\r\non Church and State should be arrived at? The somewhat obscure teaching\r\nin the Draft on the elevation of man into the supernatural order,\r\nwould, to mere politicians, look like theological nebulae, and, to mere\r\ntheologians, like ill-digested divinity. To men versed in the esoteric\r\ndialect, it was clearly intended to prepare the way for the doctrine of\r\nthe elevation of man by baptism above the control of civil law, in all\r\nthat affects his loyalty to the supernatural order of the Church, whose\r\nDecrees had, by that regeneration, become his supreme statutes, her\r\ncourts his supreme tribunals, and her priests his supreme magistrates.\r\nIt was the dogmatizing of the principle which has already passed under\r\nour eye, that in baptism the subjects of the civil power are changed.\r\nAnother principle now habitually underlies that one, namely, that man\r\nby redemption through Christ is raised above the government of the\r\nnatural order, and placed under that of Christ, through His Vicar.\r\nThe studious among the Liberal Catholics knew that under the name of\r\nNaturalism their principles were condemned.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday following the day of the petitions, when the Congregation\r\nopened, after the prayers had been read, Cardinal De Luca rang the\r\nbell, and solemnly addressed the Fathers. Here, for once, we are able\r\nto give the very words that sounded in that hall of concealment, and\r\nthis time not from an unofficial publication of official documents. It\r\nis the _Acta Sanctae Sedis_ that now actually give us a speech. But\r\nit is a speech about the dead. The Cardinal is not so confident as\r\nto their happiness as were the writers of the Crusaders of St. Peter\r\nrespecting that of those who fell in the Crusade. But he presents the\r\ntwo forms of the Papal worship of and for the dead, which differs from\r\nboth the Chinese and the Brahminical. We see the two sides of it--the\r\npatronage of the living by the dead, and the patronage of the dead by\r\nthe living. The Cardinal said--\r\n\r\n    MOST REVEREND FATHERS,--It is known to you that since the opening\r\n    of the OEcumenical Vatican Council four Fathers have passed away\r\n    by a death precious in the sight of the Lord, namely, the Most\r\n    Eminent Charles Augustus de Reisach, Bishop of the Sabina and First\r\n    President of the General Congregations; the Most Eminent Francis\r\n    Pentini, Deacon of St. Mary _in Portico;_ the Most Reverend Anthony\r\n    Manastyrski, Bishop of Przémysl of the Latin rite; and the Most\r\n    Reverend Bernardin Frascolla, Bishop of Foggia. The Christian\r\n    virtues and the shining merits towards the holy Church of God and\r\n    this Apostolic See, wherewith they were most largely adorned,\r\n    inspire us with a sure and pleasant hope that their souls already\r\n    enjoy rest eternal in the embrace of the Lord, and that in the\r\n    presence of God they patronize our labours by their intercession.\r\n    Since, however, human frailty is such that they may even now stand\r\n    in need of our suffrages, let us not neglect earnestly to commend\r\n    them to the divine mercy.\r\n\r\nAfter this De Luca announced that in place of Reisach had been\r\nappointed Cardinal De Angelis. Thus one who, just before the Council\r\nopened, knew, or professed to know, so little that he told Cardinal\r\nHohenlohe that nothing was to be done beyond condemning the principles\r\nof 1789, but who had served the Curia by the device of an election\r\nticket, took the first seat, in which elevation the Opposition saw the\r\nreward of service in the elections. Next was announced the appointment\r\nby the Pope of Cardinal Bilio as President of the Committee on\r\nFaith, and that of Cardinal Caterini as President of the Committee\r\non Discipline. The committees were not allowed to choose their own\r\nchairmen, nor yet was the Council allowed to name the chairmen of\r\nits committees.[259] The next day, after Mass had been celebrated by\r\nArchbishop Manning, again had Cardinal De Luca to announce a death.\r\nIt was that of the Bishop of Panama, a Dominican. The statement as to\r\nhis sufferings here is plain. But as to his happiness hereafter, the\r\nfull confidence felt in the case of the Crusaders, and the qualified\r\nconfidence felt in the case of the two Cardinals, and of the two\r\nbishops whose deaths were reported with that of Cardinals, are both\r\nwanting. We have not here the \"in peace\" which in Rome, before priests\r\nlearned to make a commerce of the dead, the poorest Christian wrote,\r\nit might be in the roughest scrawl, over the head of his wife or\r\nchild; nor have we here the life and immortality whereof the light\r\nmakes the happy believer \"rejoice for a brother deceased.\" Eduardo\r\nVasques was not a Crusader, and was not a Cardinal, and had not even\r\nthe happiness of being reported dead in company with a Cardinal. He\r\nwas but a bishop, and, without doubt, in the pains of purgatory; so\r\nDe Luca just said that he had died last night, after great suffering,\r\nborne with exemplary patience. \"Proper mortuary services will, as soon\r\nas possible, be performed. In the meantime, let us commend him to the\r\nmercy of God, both by the sacrifice of the Mass, and by other works of\r\nChristian charity.\"[260]\r\n\r\nThe day before the second session, a procession moved to the Vatican,\r\nof seventeen carriages, carrying seventeen deputations, each bearing an\r\naddress, with signatures, in a richly bound volume, for presentation\r\nto the Holy Father. These addresses conveyed that homage of science\r\nto the Pontiff the appeal for which has been already mentioned. _The\r\ncultivators of science at the feet of Pius IX_, and, _The cultivators\r\nof science at the throne of the Holy Father_, were the titles of\r\narticles in Catholic journals. The way was led by the deputation from\r\nthe pontifical academy of the Immaculate, which had initiated this\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThey were received in the Throne Room. A long address to the Pontiff\r\nwas read. He sat, unmoved, to hear it. Then, \"he lifted his eyes to\r\nheaven with an ineffable expression,\" and uttered a prayer that the\r\nsentiments conveyed in the address might spread among the multitudes\r\nof scientific men whose false science was ruining society. The Pope\r\nwould quote Scripture, as he often tries to do; and his text was\r\n_Captivantes intellectum vestrum in obsequium fidei_--Taking your\r\nintellect captive to the obedience of the faith. Probably he was\r\nthinking of 2 Corinthians x. 5, \"Bringing every thought into captivity\r\nto the obedience of Christ,\" where the Vulgate translates, \"Every\r\nthought (νὁημα), every intellect.\" He then assured them that\r\npride was the sin of the day, and that it was all a repetition of the\r\noriginal \"_I will not serve_\"--alluding to Satan's \"Better reign in\r\nhell than serve in heaven.\" Cold men of science hearing this language\r\nfrom him who was striving to put all human honours, titles, and powers\r\nbelow his own, might think that some scientific test of his humility\r\nwould not be amiss. The Pope rose, the _savans_ knelt down, and he gave\r\nthem the benediction.\r\n\r\nHaving then resumed his seat on the Throne, \"Here I am,\" he said,\r\nfamiliarly; \"here I am, to receive your gifts.\" There was a scientific\r\ntest of their professions! The President of the Academy of the\r\nImmaculate advanced, presented his volume containing the address and\r\nsignatures, and with it an elegant purse full of gold. The head of\r\nthe next deputation followed, presented his volume and his purse of\r\ngold, and so on, until the seventeen had completed their offering.\r\nThe Pope had a pleasant word for each. Then saying, \"God grant that\r\nyour example may be followed by many,\" he closed the audience.[261]\r\nHow different was it now from what it was when \"science was the echo\r\nof the Pontiff,\" or even from what it was when Galileo had to face the\r\nInquisition, and to argue with Bellarmine![262] At the latter moment,\r\nthe two revolted tongues, German and English, with their smaller\r\nkinsmen, Dutch, Danish, and Swedish, were unknown in the schools. Their\r\nlibraries were yet to be. They had but lately received into them the\r\nsource of their literary life--the Bible. But into them had the Bible\r\ncome, not lapped in the languor of the cloister, but instinct with the\r\nlife of a great revival.\r\n\r\nExcept a few northern schools, which had made themselves a name in\r\nthe strife of the Reformation, all seats of learning on the Continent\r\nwere on the side of the Pope. Now, how changed! Out of his own Model\r\nState, where were the universities canonically instituted? They had\r\nceased to be. Meantime, the nations which at the Reformation were but\r\nemerging out of barbarism, had become learned in all the learning\r\nof the ancients and moderns. The two revolted tongues, German and\r\nEnglish, had filled the world with a literature such as the Latin,\r\neven when Augurs and Pontiffs were called Cicero and Aurelius, had\r\nnever known. The Portuguese, which had at one time promised to be the\r\n_lingua franca_ of all the ports from Morocco to Japan, had given\r\nplace, first, largely to the Dutch, then universally to the English.\r\nThe Spanish and French, which had promised to divide between them\r\nNorth and South America, were sundered, and were both overshadowed by\r\na dominating growth of English. That north-western tongue, cradled\r\namid stern winds, was found by the Reformation as the rude but hardy\r\ndialect of some six or seven unlettered millions. Now it had become\r\nthe wealthy and flexible, the noble and all-expressing speech of at\r\nleast eighty millions. Thirty millions in Europe, with between forty\r\nand fifty millions in America, called it, with a common family pride\r\nand a common family joy, their mother-tongue. In Australasia, a future\r\nEurope promised to call it her mother-tongue. In India it was teaching\r\nthe pundit, in China the mandarin, in Japan the daimio, in Africa the\r\nKaffir chief, the Negro freedman, and the merchant of the Nile. That\r\nsingle language had now more schools and colleges, more laboratories\r\nand institutes of research, more books and journals, more patronage\r\nand discussion of Art, than all the Papal languages put together. And\r\nas to the German, if the lack of equal liberty had reined the people\r\nin, while the effects of the Thirty Years' War, joined to those of the\r\nchronic splitting up into small States, had prevented their growth and\r\nexpansion in a similar measure, they had, nevertheless, with huge and\r\npatient power, piled up a Titanic literature, and in many a movement\r\nin the higher march of intellect their banner led the van. Men of\r\nthe Catholic schools of Germany so felt their own superiority to the\r\nscience and literature of actual Rome, that the strokes of their\r\ncontempt not unfrequently fell even on the reputed sages of the Curia,\r\nsometimes laid on in a fashion more scholastic than scholarly.\r\n\r\nIn the General Congregation of January 4, the Curia had the\r\nsatisfaction of hearing, not only a diocesan bishop, but a German one,\r\ndefend the Draft.[263] It was Bishop Martin, of Paderborn, to whose\r\neminent qualities official writers bear loud testimony, though in the\r\neyes of the Liberal Catholics he does not seem to be a prodigy. He\r\nblamed the manner in which the bishops had treated a document proposed\r\nby the Pontiff, which ought to have been handled with reverence, and\r\nrebuked such language as \"to be erased.\" He desired the adoption of the\r\nSyllabus just as it stood. As the way to bring back the stray sheep\r\nto the Holy Father, he enjoined the recognition of his infallibility,\r\nwhich would reclaim Protestants. Both the expectation of Martin\r\nand Manning that the new dogma would facilitate the conversion of\r\nProtestants, and that of all the Ultramontane leaders that it would\r\nhasten the submission of governments to the Lord Paramount of the\r\nworld, lose part of their marvellousness when we find bishops like\r\nBonjean proclaiming it as of great importance for the conversion of\r\nHindus. Bishop David, of St. Brieuc, alluding to Martin's warning, said\r\nif he must not say that the Draft was to be erased, he would say that\r\nif it was dead let it rise again; but some bishop must breathe new life\r\ninto it. Friedrich says that Cardinal Bilio was particularly hurt by\r\nthis speech.\r\n\r\nBernardou, Archbishop of Sens, read a speech for Audu, the Patriarch\r\nof Babylon. The Chaldean solemnly pleaded against the levelling\r\nproceedings of Rome, maintained the ancient immunities of his Church,\r\nand ventured to throw out a warning against innovations, lest the\r\nOrientals should be altogether alienated. He afterwards received a\r\nmessage to repair to the Vatican, and to come unattended. About seven\r\no'clock on that January night, the man of seventy-eight passed the\r\nSwiss guards, in their stripes and slashes of yellow, black, and red,\r\nwith their halberds and their helmets, and while lonelily pacing the\r\ncorridors, had time to remember how the house of the Inquisition stood\r\nover the way, and how utterly he was in the power of the King of the\r\nVatican. It will be some time before what befell him comes to light.\r\n\r\nTheiner, the celebrated Prefect of the Vatican Archives, had been long\r\nengaged, as was universally known, in preparing for publication the\r\n_Acta_ of the Council of Trent. He had been arrested in this project.\r\nThis was attributed to the instigation of the Jesuits. On January 4\r\nFriedrich went to Theiner to beg permission to consult the _Acta_\r\nof Trent. \"Theiner told me that he was now forbidden to let any one\r\neven see the _Acta_. All I could obtain from him was this--he showed\r\nme the piles of the copied documents in the distance\" (p. 65). There\r\nis a picture for the days of an OEcumenical Council![264] The day\r\nfollowing, another German on the banks of the Spree, was busy with\r\nthe Council. To Bismarck the state of things so far was chaotic. \"I\r\nshould not think it wise,\" he says to Arnim, \"for us to intermeddle in\r\nthis misty chaos, where we do not yet see clearly enough to choose the\r\nright basis of operations.\" He sees that Rome may make aggressions,\r\nbut rests in proud repose in the power of the nation to throw her\r\nback within her proper bounds. The continuance of peaceful relations\r\nis greatly to be desired, but it is not for the government to attempt\r\nto give a direction to the events of the Council. It can only cherish\r\nsympathy with the efforts of the German bishops, and, _if they desire\r\nit_, give them its support. Bismarck expressly declines to support\r\nby any diplomatic step the proposal for vote by nations. Such a step\r\nwould involve a serious recognition of the pretensions of the Curia. We\r\nmust, he says, hold ourselves aloof from the Council, and free to bring\r\nits conclusions to the bar of our laws. He, therefore, does not deem\r\nit wise to attempt a permanent united meeting of diplomatists, with a\r\nview to influence the Council. All that can be done is to encourage the\r\nGerman bishops, and to assure them that their rights will be maintained\r\nin their own country. But they must be made fully to understand that\r\nserious changes in the organization of the Church would compel the\r\ngovernment to alter its relation to her, both in legislation and in\r\nadministration.[265] Had Bismarck known all the plans of the five\r\npreceding years, and all the events that were to follow, it is doubtful\r\nif he could have taken a better course. And had his main object been\r\nto live at peace with Rome, and not merely to do the wisest thing for\r\nGermany, he could hardly have guarded more jealously against undue or\r\npremature interference.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 248: _Tagebuch_, p. 44.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 249: _Tagebuch_, p. 45.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 250: _Acton_, p. 73.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 251: _Tagebuch_, p. 44.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 252: _Acta Sanctæ Sedis_, v. 316. i.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 253: Vol. v. p. 316.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 254: _Acton_, pp. 74, 75, both in German and Latin.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 255: _Documenta_, i. 247.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 256: \"Consultationem sicut decet haberi non posse.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 257: _Documenta_, ii. 383; also _Friedberg_, 410-14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 258: _Friedberg_, xlv.; _Cecconi_, 483-89; and _Frond_, vii.\r\np. 263.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 259: _Acta Sanctae Sedis_. v. 317-18.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 260: _Ibid._ 319.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 261: _Civiltá_, VII. ix. 358-9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 262: Valuable light has lately been thrown on the two trials\r\nof Galileo by Dr. Reusch, of Bonn; and Signor Berti, ex-Minister of\r\nInstruction in Italy, has published the original record of the trial.\r\nThe last I have not seen.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 263: _Tagebuch_, p. 63.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 264: This tale of Friedrich may form a pendant to one of\r\nTheiner's own. He relates how, in seeking for Tridentine documents\r\nwhich ought to have been in the Vatican, but were not, and some of\r\nwhich were in the library of Lord Guildford, he proposed to make a\r\njourney all the way to England. His brother oratorian, Dr. Newman,\r\napplied to Lord Guildford requesting that Theiner might have access to\r\nthem. This was refused. That nobleman could not see why the Prefect\r\nof the Vatican Archives should come so far to examine documents of\r\nwhich there must be abundance there! Poor Theiner had found poverty,\r\nnot abundance. There had been removal, as well as concealment. His ill\r\nsuccess in England did not prevent him from saying that the honour of\r\nfirst publishing the minutes of Paleotti was due to the Rev. Joseph\r\nMendham, an Anglican presbyter,--\"which, certainly, is not to our\r\nhonour or glory\" (vol. i. pp. vi. vii.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 265: _Cologne Gazette_, April 1, 1874.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nThe Second Public Session--Swearing a Creed never before known in a\r\nGeneral Council--Really an Oath including Feudal Obedience.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same tone of disappointment in which the _Civiltá_ had said that\r\nas the discussion of the Draft was not concluded, no Decree would\r\nbe promulged in the second session, pervaded the additional remark\r\nthat the world would describe as a vain ceremony the recital of the\r\ncreed with which it had been resolved to fill up the day. Writers of\r\ndifferent shades, as if by concert, did describe it as a religious\r\nceremony,--a mere ceremony, an empty ceremony, a vain ceremony, and a\r\ntedious ceremony.\r\n\r\nSo far from taking this session as a vain show, we take it for one\r\nof the most distinctive footmarks left in the deposits of history\r\nby the mammoth which we call the Papacy. Without contrivance of\r\nman--in contravention, indeed, of arrangements made with patient\r\nforethought--the Vatican Council was compelled, under guise of reciting\r\na creed, to exhibit its bishops as if barons swearing allegiance to a\r\nprince in peril of losing his estates. The creed recited was one never\r\nbefore seen or heard of in any General Council. An apparent accident\r\nset the faith of the early Church, and the modern composite oath and\r\ncreed, before the eye of history in a contrast sharper than any artist\r\ncould have devised.\r\n\r\nA cause similar to that which led to this day being employed in setting\r\nface to face the old creed and the new, had at Trent led to the act\r\nthat formed the reverse of the medal. At Trent, on the day fixed for\r\nthe third session, no Decree was ready for promulgation, just as none\r\nwas ready at the Vatican on that fixed for the second.\r\n\r\nConsequently, at Trent, after much reluctance, the Fathers, rather\r\nthan let the day appointed pass without a session, consented to fill\r\nup the time in doing what many of them felt would expose them to\r\nridicule--in reciting the creed. Thus did they create an example which\r\nthe Curia now followed. Two unforeseen accidents, linked together only\r\nby the association of precedent, led to the placing of the Catholic\r\ncreed as it existed up to the Council of Trent, and the Romish creed\r\nas framed after Trent, side by side in a framework so impressive as to\r\nensure the exhibition of the two in contrast to all ages.\r\n\r\nAt Trent the Fathers said that they would set forth as the firm and\r\nsole foundation, against which the gates of hell should not prevail,\r\nthe creed used by the Roman Church, which was the _principium_, wherein\r\n\"all who confessed Christ\" of necessity concurred,--an expression which\r\nseems as if it was the last breath of catholicity on the lips of the\r\nPapal society. Another slight reminiscence of catholicity appears when\r\nit is said that the creed is given in the exact words in which it is\r\nread \"in all churches,\"--a terminology proper to apostolic pens, or\r\nto the lips of our glorified Lord, speaking to His servant John, when\r\nthe word \"churches\" was the Christian vernacular, and \"church\" as a\r\ncollective was rarely used, and only in the very largest sense possible.\r\n\r\nLed by a way which they knew not, the Fathers at Trent set up a\r\nmemorial of the faith of the Christian Churches as they found it in\r\nthe creed. Led also by a way which they knew not, the Fathers at the\r\nVatican set up an everlasting remembrance of what their predecessors at\r\nTrent had done with the faith.\r\n\r\nThe Cardinals arrived on the morning of the Epiphany, dressed in red;\r\nbut they changed to the white proper to the day. Patriarchs, primates,\r\narchbishops, bishops, abbots and generals of orders, were all in white,\r\nexcept the Orientals, who had never surrendered to the primacy of Rome\r\non the sacred subject of vestments. The Pope entered the hall, as he\r\nhad done at the first session, between Antonelli and Mertel.\r\n\r\nAfter Mass, Dominicis-Tosti and Philip Ralli, the two Promoters of\r\nthe Council; reverently drew nigh to the throne, and addressing the\r\nPontiff, said:--\r\n\r\n    Inasmuch as, by ancient appointment of the Fathers, the sacred\r\n    Councils of the Church have been wont to set the Confession of the\r\n    Faith in the forefront of all their doings, as a buckler against\r\n    every heresy, we, therefore, the Promoters of this Vatican Council,\r\n    do humbly pray that profession of the Catholic faith in the form\r\n    prescribed by thy predecessor of sacred memory, Pius IV, be made\r\n    this day, in public session by all the Fathers of this Vatican\r\n    Council.\r\n\r\nThe Pontiff replied, \"We enjoin and command accordingly.\"\r\n\r\nThen arose the sovereign from his throne, took off the sacred mitre,\r\nand, with loud and clear voice, recited for the first time in the\r\nhistory of man, as the belief of a General Council, the creed of Pius\r\nIV. Near the end of it, he came to the clause which swears obedience to\r\nthe Roman Pontiff. This he omitted. The conclusion swears to maintain\r\nthe faith just recited, and, as much as in the confessor lies, to\r\nenforce it \"on all those committed to him.\" The Pope simply said to\r\nenforce it \"upon all,\" and then he closed according to the regular\r\nform,--\"I, Pius, promise, vow, and swear, so help me God, and these\r\nGod's Holy Gospels.\"\r\n\r\nBishop Fessler, Secretary of the Council, and Bishop Valenziani, now\r\ncame to the throne. The Pontiff handed to them the creed of Pius IV,\r\njust as he had handed his own Decrees at the first session. Valenziani,\r\nascending the pulpit, recited it, in his own name and in that of all\r\nthe Fathers. When he came to the portentous obedience clause, omitted\r\nby him who owes no account to man, tribunal, or nation, the bishop,\r\nread, \"To the Roman Pontiff, successor of the blessed Peter, prince\r\nof the Apostles, and Vicar of Jesus Christ, I promise and swear true\r\nobedience,\"--as if it was an installation in a feudal order. No wonder\r\nthat Canon Pelletier, writing in Frond (vol. vii. p. 170), should say\r\nthat this act of homage, \"in the circumstances of which all are aware,\r\nhad an immense importance.\" Valenziani then concluded the form as the\r\nPope had done, only, instead of enforcing obedience \"upon all,\" it was\r\n\"on all committed to him.\"\r\n\r\nPatrizi, the Senior Cardinal present,[266] now rose, came to the\r\nthrone, knelt, laid his hand on the volume of the Gospels, and lifting\r\nup his voice, said, \"I, Constantine, Bishop of Porto and Rufina,\r\npromise, vow, and swear according to the form now read, so help me God,\r\nand these God's Holy Gospels\"; and he kissed the book.\r\n\r\nThen Cardinals and Patriarchs, one by one, after them Primates,\r\nArchbishops, Bishops, Abbots, and Generals of Orders, in regular\r\ngradation of rank, first two and two, and, later, four and four,[267]\r\ncame successively to the throne, and during the space of two hours,\r\nknelt down, laid the hand on the book, repeated the above words, each\r\ninserting his own name, kissed the book, and so swore allegiance to the\r\nKing of the Vatican, under the form of a profession of the simple and\r\nloving faith of Christ. The two creeds, recited at Trent and in St.\r\nPeter's, are below, in parallel columns--the one representing what the\r\nCouncil of Trent found, and the other representing what it left. Future\r\nepochs will have to mark subsequent innovations. We put _the clause\r\nforming the basis of the new dogmas in_ italics. The other italics are\r\nthose given in Dr. Challoner's recension[268]:--\r\n\r\n THE CATHOLIC CREED BEFORE              THE ROMISH CREED AFTER THE\r\n THE REFORMATION                        REFORMATION\r\n\r\n \"I, N., with a firm faith,             \"I, N., with a firm faith,\r\n believe and profess all and             believe and profess all and\r\n every one of the things which           every one of the things which\r\n are contained in that creed             are contained in that creed\r\n which the holy Roman Church             which the holy Roman Church\r\n maketh use of; namely--                 maketh use of; namely--\r\n\r\n \"I believe in one God, the             \"I believe in one God, the\r\n Father Almighty, Maker of               Father Almighty, Maker of\r\n heaven and earth, and of all            heaven and earth, and of all\r\n things visible and invisible:           things visible and invisible:\r\n and in one Lord Jesus Christ,           and in one Lord Jesus Christ,\r\n the only-begotten Son of God,           the only-begotten Son of God,\r\n _born of the Father before all ages_:   _born of the Father before all\r\n God of God; Light of light;             ages_: God of God; Light of light;\r\n true God of true God; begotten,         true God of true God; begotten,\r\n not made; consubstantial                not made; consubstantial to\r\n to the Father, by whom                  the Father, by whom all things\r\n all things were made; who,              were made; who, for us men,\r\n for us men, and for our salvation,      and for our salvation, came down\r\n came down from heaven,                  from heaven, and was incarnate\r\n and was incarnate by the Holy           by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin\r\n Ghost of the Virgin Mary, and           Mary, and was made man.\r\n was made man.

If ever it was true, it is\r\nhere true, that the old is better. Under the old creed, the conscience\r\nis not hampered by any question about the authority of traditions,\r\neither apostolic so-called, or such as were confessedly ecclesiastical.\r\nThe conscience is not perplexed with a fear of interpreting Holy\r\nScripture differently from the unanimous opinion of the Fathers. It\r\nis not weighted with seven sacraments, not contracted with scruples\r\nabout mere rites and modes of administration, not burdened by having\r\nto take for gospel every word which some past Council has said on\r\nsome specified doctrine; not bewildered by a professed repetition\r\nofttimes of the sacrifice once offered up forever, full, perfect, and\r\nsufficient; not materialized by transubstantiation of the substance\r\nof the bread and wine, not mystified by taking half a sacrament for a\r\nwhole one, and by asserting that the deliberate evasion of Christ's\r\nsacramental command was a true performance of it; not secularized\r\nby the mercantile reckonings of purgatory; not let down from filial\r\nChristianity towards servile polytheism by the worship of saints,\r\nrelics, and images; not demoralized by the traffic in indulgences; not\r\nnarrowed by the domination of one municipal Church over all others;\r\nnot cramped and degraded by identification with the sins and follies\r\nof one human head, much less by an allegiance to that head, as a lord\r\nof the faith and a sovereign of the conscience; not envenomed by\r\nanathematizing all who do not accept every article that we ourselves\r\naccept.\r\n\r\nTrent diminished the comprehensiveness of the Papal Society by many\r\nnew and some grotesque conditions. The present Pontiff has added\r\nothers, and so far has the shrinking process been now carried that\r\na _reductio ad absurdum_ cannot be logically far off. Believing too\r\nmuch, which comes to believing too little, ends in believing nothing.\r\nAll these successive submissions of conscience to \"authority,\" of\r\nspiritual inquiry and private judgment to priestly dictation, end in\r\nthe paralysis of the believing faculty. They render a man capable of\r\nnothing but submitting.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary oath of the Papal bishops has often been shown to be in\r\nsubstance the oath of a feudal vassal to his liege lord. It has but a\r\nflavour of any evangelical office or work of the soul-winning ministry\r\nof Christ. The Emperor Joseph II clearly saw that any man bound to the\r\nPope by that oath could not be reckoned as the subject of any other\r\nprince, except by one of those generous fictions which on behalf of\r\nthe Pope, by way of exception, governments have admitted. But even that\r\noath was not enough; the confession of faith in God must, for all the\r\nclergy, be turned into an oath of loyalty to the Bishop of Rome--an\r\noath to a human head in a creed!\r\n\r\nThe process of taking the oath lasted, as we have said, two hours.\r\nThe crowd was not great. The session did not raise enthusiasm in any\r\none. Friedrich, who viewed the act of homage from the gallery for\r\ntheologians, said that nothing could be more tedious. He did not feel\r\nflattered with his company in that gallery. Formerly, only doctors were\r\nknown at Councils as theologians, and, as we have seen, they had real\r\nwork to do. Now, he says, the chaplains and secretaries of bishops,\r\nand even the men who carry the red caps of the Cardinals, figure as\r\ntheologians--\"an edifying company.\" Even the _Stimmen_ had only a few\r\nsentences for this session; and the _Civiltá_, though read principally\r\nby persons who may be supposed to have already seen the creed of\r\nPius IV, filled up room by printing it at full. Quirinus wondered\r\nwhether this \"profusion of superfluous oaths was reconcilable with the\r\nscriptural prohibition of needless oaths.\" They had seven hundred and\r\nforty-seven oaths taken.\r\n\r\nOnly the genius of M. Veuillot sufficed, so far as we remember, to\r\ncheer the gloom of the day. It was the Epiphany, and in the portions of\r\nScripture included in the offices of the day, he saw the interpretation\r\nof the ceremony. The royally robed potentates who bowed before the\r\nenthroned priest-king were _the kings of the Gentiles_ prostrating\r\nthemselves and worshipping the Church, presenting their gold, and\r\nfrankincense and, myrrh. The words of Isaiah, \"The nations shall come\r\nto Thy light, and the kings to the brightness of Thy rising,\" had the\r\nsame grand meaning. So he cries (i. 79):--\r\n\r\n    Behold St. Peter's! The throne of the Pontiff and the Cardinal at\r\n    the altar, and between throne and altar eight hundred bishops!\r\n    Behold the prophecy and behold the fact!\r\n\r\nM. Veuillot remarks that in the galleries were present diplomatists\r\nand princes who had fallen; but the Church abides! In the crowd, he\r\nsays, was an Italian \"revolutionist, Signor Minghetti, once a subject\r\nand minister of the Pope. He bowed with propriety under the benediction\r\nof his Father and his master, who was betrayed by him; but he abides!\"\r\nThe fallen princes represented those who, having supported the Papacy,\r\nboth temporal and spiritual, had been brought to ruin by its bad\r\nteaching and worse example. Signor Minghetti and his bow represented\r\nthose who, rejecting the temporal Papacy, wished to conserve at least\r\nthe show of the spiritual Papacy. It is for future time to tell whether\r\nthey to whom he will bequeath the tangled undertaking, will take their\r\nplace with ex-kings, ex-dukes, ex-princes, and so forth, in the gallery\r\nof failures, or whether they will take their place among the wise men\r\nwho, rejecting the spiritual as worse than the temporal Papacy, and\r\nrisking all to found States on the principles of the Word of God, have\r\nbuilt up great and happy realms. Italy not does think a principle worth\r\nrunning any risk for. She thinks it practical to say to the Papacy, We\r\nhave found thee unfaithful in the unrighteous mammon, and therefore do\r\nwe take it from thee, but we commit to thy trust the true riches.\r\n\r\nThe _Acta Sanctæ Sedis_ say that no date was fixed for the next\r\nsession. The confidence in the readiness of the Fathers to swallow\r\na large pamphlet of creed in a few days was shaken. \"No one,\"\r\nis it pensively added, \"could foresee when Decrees would be in\r\nreadiness, because many Fathers might probably be lengthy in their\r\ndiscourses.\"[269] The learned editor seems as if he would fain emulate\r\nthe flight of M. Veuillot, but he soars with weighted wing. In a long\r\napostrophe to Rome, he styles Pius IX \"the captain who gloriously\r\nfills the place of thine ancient Caesars.\"[270] In one of his speeches\r\nmade to Roman professors, Pius IX calls himself \"the Cæsar who now\r\naddresses you,[271] and to whom alone are obedience and fidelity due.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the Curia left this session under the damping\r\neffects of a disappointment. It is also evident that some of the\r\nbishops felt that they had now performed two sessions, with a month\r\nbetween them, and that the only distinct impression left upon the mind\r\nwas that they had been twice exhibited, before the whole world, at the\r\nfeet of a man more richly robed than themselves, seated on a throne\r\nin the house of God, and calling himself Father of kings and princes,\r\nand Governor of the world. Canon Pelletier points out the great\r\nadvantage which the Church had obtained by having the Creed of Pius IV\r\n\"consecrated\" in a General Council.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 266: The Dean of the Sacred College, Cardinal Mattei, was\r\nunable to attend the sittings.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 267: _Acta Sanctæ Sedis._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 268: _The Grounds of the Catholic Faith_, p. 3.

Even the language of\r\nM. Veuillot does not exaggerate the effect of his speech upon that\r\noccasion. \"What he said on the Council will loudly resound through the\r\nCatholic universe.\" What he said cut the bishops of the Opposition, and\r\nLiberal Catholics generally, to the heart. We quote from the version of\r\nM. Veuillot:--\r\n\r\n    Would-be wise men would have us treat certain questions charily,\r\n    and not march against the ideas of the age, but I say that we must\r\n    speak the truth, in order to establish liberty. We must never fear\r\n    to proclaim the truth or to condemn error. I want to be free, and\r\n    want the truth to be free. Pray then, weep, force the Holy Spirit,\r\n    by your supplications, to support and enlighten the Fathers of the\r\n    Council, that the truth may triumph and error may be condemned.\r\n\r\nAfter his first version of the speech, M. Veuillot said that a word had\r\nbeen \"unfortunately omitted.\" The Pope had said that those who opposed\r\ncertain measures were\r\n\r\n    blind leaders of the blind. Well, if the leaders want not to\r\n    lead any but the blind, and cannot see their game, the Church,\r\n    preserving her own liberty, will know how to win without them or\r\n    against them, the game which they obstinately set themselves to\r\n    lose (i. pp. 86 and 100).\r\n\r\nThis was treated, not as a mere gust of temper, but as a calculated\r\nappeal through the press to the clergy, and to the devout generally,\r\nagainst the bishops of the Opposition. Yet the longing of the Pope\r\nfor his liberty was natural. He had always believed himself to be\r\ninfallible. The Jesuits told him that the full recognition of that\r\nattribute, and the free use of it, were the only remedies for the\r\nmisfortunes of the Papacy, and for the troubles of mankind. He read in\r\nthe _Civiltá_ how all nations were at this moment looking to him as\r\nthe one saviour, capable of lifting them out of the Slough of Despond\r\ninto which the Reformation first and the Revolution next had plunged\r\nthem. He heard of faithful bishops, learned authors, able journalists,\r\none after another, intimating in prophetic strains an era of glory to\r\nfollow the recognition of his rights. All asked, how could the world\r\ndo otherwise than stumble and fall so long as the divinely appointed\r\nguide was not recognized? All asserted that nothing could prevent the\r\nworld from rising up, healed and created anew, when the Vicar of God,\r\nacknowledged by the Church, in the plentitude of this authority, should\r\nspeak the word, Let there be light, at which chaos would flee away,\r\nand when he should follow it up with the supreme word to kings and\r\nnations alike, which all must learn to obey. Heretics would resist, but\r\nthe faithful, under the banner of the Vicar of God, would certainly\r\nprevail. Nothing stood in the way of all this blessing and glory but a\r\nfew bishops.\r\n\r\nThese bishops were represented as being partly calculating men,\r\nunwilling to get into trouble with their governments; partly cowards,\r\nwho actually feared that the standard of his Holiness might fall in the\r\nstruggle. Some were represented as jealous priests, paltering about\r\nthe little prerogatives of their Sees, instead of merging all in the\r\nglories of the Holy See. If, in a matter so great, the Pope chafed at\r\ndelay caused by such inconsiderable men, it was not more than might\r\nbe expected from human nature so incensed, and so persuaded, even in\r\nthe case of one less vehemently suspected of vanity and self-will than\r\nis Pius IX. He said that some thought that the Council was to set\r\neverything to rights, and some that it would accomplish nothing. \"I\r\nam but a poor man, a poor feeble man, but I am Pope, Vicar of Jesus\r\nChrist, and head of the Catholic Church, and I have assembled the\r\nCouncil, which will do its work.\"[272]\r\n\r\nM. Veuillot also was becoming a little impatient. He apparently wanted\r\nto see the beginning of the \"clearing away\" of which he had spoken in\r\n1867. The following passage, tracing out the policy that might save the\r\nSecond Empire, is a specimen of skilled writing, clear to his clerical\r\nreaders, dim to heedless Parisians. The new minister (Ollivier) must\r\naccept this program:--\r\n\r\n    To break with the Gallican, revolutionary, and Cæsarian prejudice\r\n    (which are all one) by frankly recognizing the liberty of the\r\n    Church; to assure all liberty by and through the assertion of\r\n    this liberty, as mother and mistress; to prepare the accessions\r\n    necessary to the honour and the conservation of peace; to permit\r\n    men to be made against this perpetual plague of revolution which\r\n    exudes only courtiers of the mob, or courtiers of Cæsar; this is\r\n    the grand game he has to play. In the interest of the Emperor and\r\n    the dynasty, I wish he may win it. Alas! during the last twenty\r\n    years the game has been lost, more than once, by the fault of the\r\n    chief player! But Providence is pleased to be obstinate, and to\r\n    leave the game open, with favourable cards in the same hands (vol.\r\n    i. p. 98).\r\n\r\nIn the gloaming of these January evenings, two men, might be seen\r\nwalking somewhere between the Ripetta and the Via Condotti, and the\r\ntall figure of one of them was that of Count Harry von Arnim. A letter\r\nwhich he on one such occasion handed to the other was published,\r\nin 1874, by the _Presse_, of Vienna,[273] and bore the date of the\r\nday before the impatient speech of the Pope. To whom the letter was\r\naddressed is not stated. Alluding to the petition of the bishops,\r\nCount Arnim says: \"You see they are modest, and organization is as\r\ndefective as courage.\" He feels the want of practical tact in the\r\nbishops. If they had meant to succeed in their opposition, they ought\r\nto have impugned the composition of the Council, and the Rules imposed\r\nupon it. Had they first of all rent the net which the Vatican and the\r\nGesu [the Jesuit establishment] had cast over the wise but timid heads\r\nof the bishops, infallibility would have fallen through the meshes.\r\nThe Count is not sure that the Curia will persevere with the dogma of\r\ninfallibility; and does not see of what advantage it would be to them,\r\nwhen they can at any time call a Council and prescribe to it how and\r\nwhat it is to speak. Some of the Fathers feel as if they were in some\r\nsort the Pope's prisoners since they have entered on the course into\r\nwhich they had been drawn. They had allowed themselves to be led so\r\nfar in a certain direction during the last twenty years, that it was\r\nonly when they saw that it was to be turned to earnest, that they began\r\nto ask how they could make black white at home, and how the Catholic\r\npeople would take it. That was the feeling that produced \"Fulda.\"\r\nPeople belonging to the Curia say that the bishops need a couple of\r\nmonths in the air of Rome to inspire them with the grand conceptions of\r\nthe place; and after that all will be of one mind. He cannot understand\r\nhow the German Catholics are going to let five hundred Italians, and\r\namong them three hundred boarders of the Pope, dictate laws to them\r\nin spite of their own bishops. Under the pretence of Catholicity,\r\nexclusive Romish-Italian formulæ are imposed on the Catholic mind of\r\nall nations.\r\n\r\nIf Rome resented the obstinacy of the provincials, some of the\r\nprovincials began to open their eyes at what they found in Rome.\r\nFriedrich quotes one well acquainted with the Curia, whose words may\r\nbe matched out of Liverani. \"The Cardinals,\" said this authority,\r\n\"are red-stockinged ... not fit, with the exception of four or five,\r\nto be curates in a village church.\" Friedrich himself had begun to\r\nthink that their principal function was \"parading.\" But at that Court\r\ndid not everything depend upon parading? Many of the Cardinals might\r\nbe no better men than the tongue of Rome (not a scrupulous one) made\r\nthem, and no greater theologians than Liverani and Friedrich said that\r\nthey were, but some of them assuredly had great abilities, and all\r\nhad shown themselves to be blessed with the faculty of getting on,\r\nwhich is generally some qualification for ruling. Disgusted by the low\r\nappearance of the monks and their mendicity, Friedrich yet confessed\r\nthat, in present circumstances, such swarms of them had an advantage,\r\nas keeping a certain sort of population out of mischief. How different\r\nthe view of M. Veuillot! To him the monks were the ideal of Christ's\r\nbenefit to mankind. Free from the world, from the care even of a name\r\nor a tomb, the world \"must allow their crushing sandals to pass over\r\nthe poisons which its pride has sown\" (i. p. 223). It remains to be\r\nseen whether the plants springing from seeds that quickly fall from\r\na free Bible, a free soul, a free pulpit, and a free press, will die\r\ncrushed as poison plants under the sandals of the monk, or whether they\r\nwill yet flourish like grass of the earth, and the fruit of them shall\r\nshake like Lebanon, when _fakir_ and monk shall together be remembered\r\namong the things that fatally decay in the shade of a growth which,\r\nthough at first the least of herbs, becomes afterwards the greatest of\r\nall trees.\r\n\r\nIn the street Friedrich met Graf A., doubtless one who then proudly\r\nfilled a proud post, but who now unhappily lies under a heavy cloud.\r\nThe Count told him that a petition in favour of bringing forward the\r\nquestion of infallibility, drawn up in Manning's sense was already\r\nsigned by five hundred bishops. Another of Friedrich's touches is, that\r\n_Janus_ always lay on Darboy's table, and Hergenröther's _Anti-Janus_\r\non that of Ketteler. After calling the latter work very dishonest, he\r\nsays \"The upshot of this book is, that the Pope alone is invested with\r\ndivine authority, and before this Baal of the Jesuits, the majority of\r\nthe Council means to bow the knee. Will not that amount to decreeing\r\nthe death of the Church? She may lay herself down crying, 'Jesuits,\r\nyou have conquered me.'\" As a specimen of what bishops even in Council\r\nassembled had come to, he quotes the memorable words of Hergenröther,\r\n\"_The bishops have nothing to do but to set the conciliar seal to a\r\nwork which the Jesuit Schrader has prepared._\"\r\n\r\n\"Happy bishops,\" cries the poor theologian, himself tormented by\r\nopinions, and unable to let others believe for him. \"Happy bishops!\r\nyou may give dinners, see works of art, take your siestas, parade in\r\npluvial and mitre, for the Jesuit Father has taken care of all the\r\nrest; and, then, setting to the conciliar seal is not hard work! There\r\nis nothing to do but to say _Placet_, and all is over.\" Much depended\r\non the interpretation men gave to their oath. Canon Pelletier (_Frond_,\r\nvii. p. 170) says, not unnaturally, that at the moment when the Fathers\r\nprostrated themselves at the feet of the Pope, the majority was formed.\r\nAll who understood \"obey\" in the sense of the Court, would vote what\r\nthe Pope told them to vote. But Ginoulhiac, of Grenoble, soon to be\r\nPrimate of France, had taken care, beforehand, to protest against such\r\nan interpretation. Though expressing some fear in citing it, he did\r\ncite the language of Bellarmine, to the effect that so free must a\r\nCouncil be that the bishops, their oath notwithstanding, must not only\r\nsay what they think, but must even proceed against the Pope should he\r\nbe convicted of heresy.[274] Such language, in the mouth of Bellarmine,\r\nas contrasted with that of Deschamps, Manning, and the other zealots of\r\ninfallibility, marks the progress made by the Papal claims in our day.\r\n\r\nThe General Congregations were resumed on January 8, when two new\r\nDrafts on discipline were distributed. The Congregation of the 10th\r\nwas remarkable for striking speeches, and for an unforeseen turn of\r\nthe debate. Haynald, Archbishop of Colocza, replied to the few who\r\nhad defended the Draft, especially to Martin, and Räss of Strasburg.\r\nHe charged them with having attempted to deprive the Fathers even of\r\nthe liberty left to them by the Rules, for they had reproached them\r\nfor discussing what was laid before them. Did not even the formula at\r\nthe head of the Decree, for speaking on which Strossmayer had been\r\ncalled to order, say, \"the Council approving\"? which surely implied\r\nthat it was open to it to disapprove. Martin had said, We shall say\r\n\"It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us;\" But, rejoined Haynald,\r\nthough Martin may know that we are to say so, _we_ do not know it.\r\nThis speech was described as one of remarkable power, second in that\r\nrespect only to the speech of Strossmayer. Cardinal Capalti, one of\r\nthe Presidents, listened with outstretched neck, and both hands behind\r\nhis ears; but so skilfully was the discourse constructed, that Haynald\r\nescaped being called to order. He was often applauded, especially at\r\nthe conclusion. It is said that Cardinal Bilio, who was responsible for\r\nthe Draft, being, for a Cardinal, strong in German, knew three words of\r\nit,--_Deutsche_ (German), and _freie Wissenschaft_ (free science). He\r\nleaned back, often repeating, with an inward shudder, _Deutsche, freie\r\nWissenschaft_.\r\n\r\nBishop Maignan, of Chalons, who followed Haynald, did not mount the\r\npulpit, but stood before the Presidents. His speech was also spoken of\r\nas having been very striking. He attacked the Draft, especially its\r\nphraseology. What, he asked, was meant by _anima est forma corporis_\r\n(the soul is the _form_ of the body)? The Greek Bishop of Grosswardein\r\ndefended the Draft, saying that at first he had doubts, but that the\r\nmore he studied it the more he was satisfied. As he had previously\r\nsaid, in the meeting of German and Hungarian prelates, \"I do not like\r\nmany dogmas,\"[275] when he next appeared among them some one said,\r\n\"Greek faith is no faith,\" and he appeared among them no more. A\r\nChaldean prelate, Kajat, speaking with a fine, clear voice, said,\r\n\"It was scarcely becoming for a General Council to be occupied with\r\nmatters so local as the opinions of this or that German professor\";\r\nand repeated the unwelcome words, \"Free science,\" as Haynald and\r\nMaignan had done. The debate now seemed as if it might prove very\r\nsearching. The minority had strong, if ill-grounded, hopes, but a\r\nnew proof of the way in which the Rules played with deliberation was\r\nnow sprung upon them. If a free assembly can close a discussion when\r\nit deems it already ample, it can also continue it so long as the\r\nconscience of its members cries out for a hearing. After the speech of\r\nthe Bishop of Grosswardein, up rose the President, and said that, in\r\npursuance of power given in the Rules, of Withdrawing a Draft Decree\r\nwhen disputed, the Draft should now be withdrawn from the Council,\r\nand should be remitted to the Committee, to be moulded by it. What!\r\ncould not the Council go on with its investigation? Had it not control\r\nover a proposition once laid before it? No; the Twenty-four, with the\r\ntheologians of the Court, were now in sole possession of the proposed\r\nmeasure!\r\n\r\nHad the Council been free to form itself into a committee, or to\r\nselect one from among its own members after this discussion, doubtless\r\nsome of the men who had shown that they were capable of sifting the\r\nclauses would have been put upon the committee, beside the few who had\r\ndefended the Draft. But that was the very danger which the Nine had\r\nforeseen, and against which they had provided by a permanent committee,\r\nelected before the question was argued. This provision was effective\r\nfor its end, reducing the part left to the bishops to that of making\r\nLatin speeches in rows, according to rank and seniority. One other\r\nliberty they had--the momentous one of saying Ay or No. Had not the\r\nCouncil been weighted with creatures of the Court, that single liberty\r\nmight have sufficed to stay the great organic change necessary to the\r\nscheme of reconstruction. We do not know whether the sitting we have\r\njust described[276] is the one of which Quirinus stated that Cardinal\r\nAntonelli withdrew from it much disgusted, saying to a diplomatist that\r\nif the Council went on so it would never have done.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, the Curia, disgusted with the bishops, had seen their\r\nperfect work torn to pieces day by day, now the bishops, astounded at\r\nthe Curia, saw the future creed shut up in secret even from them!\r\nIn its absence, they began on the fourteenth to discuss discipline.\r\nThat was a notable day. It witnessed the creation of a new mortal sin.\r\nThe _Acta_ do not contain the document by which this was done.[277]\r\nIn Councils that were really general, a Christian bishop would have\r\nconsidered it a duty to tell his clergy and people what he said, and\r\nwhat he heard others say, about the faith of Christ. But on this day,\r\nPope Pius IX turned this sacred duty of the bishop into a mortal sin.\r\nSecrecy, the genius of the Papacy, and publicity, the child of light,\r\nnow closed for a life and death grapple. Any man of that assembly who\r\nshould hereafter tell out of it what passed within it was to be guilty\r\nof mortal sin. The oath imposed before the opening upon the officers,\r\nand the injunctions of secrecy upon the bishops, had not availed.\r\nThe step taken by the Pope was a loud acknowledgment that truth had\r\nleaked out. In a surly way this is admitted by the _Acta Sanctæ Sedis_.\r\nShameless journals--_effrontes ephemerides_--had reported, as having\r\nbeen spoken and done in the Council, things partly true and partly\r\nfalse. \"This had probably arisen from some one or another, who lightly\r\nheld the _pontifical secret_, having given information, so taking\r\nupon himself to ignore the dignity of the Apostolic See in treating\r\necclesiastical questions.\"[278] Vitelleschi, Roman as he is, asks,--If\r\nthe Council is a supreme assembly, who is entitled to impose this\r\npenalty of mortal sin? Men of the Curia, accustomed to the making of\r\ninnocent acts into sins, and of sins into licensed actions, would\r\nnot scruple to read such a document in the face of such an assembly.\r\nSuch is their state of conscience, that, far from feeling any shame,\r\nprobably they would enjoy the idea of the shame and confusion of\r\nconscience which they were inflicting on the bishops. But men brought\r\nup in England and America could sit there, while this new yoke was\r\nfastened upon them, and say not a word! The bishops were really to be\r\npitied. They were entangled in the creed. Their oath had shut them\r\nin. There is no hint of a protest having been raised by any one. To\r\nspeak of these gentlemen in one aspect as citizens of free nations,\r\nand in another aspect as prefects of the Pope, is scarcely any longer\r\naccurate. It is but by a fiction of the frailest sort that men so\r\ntied and bound by the chain of the foreign potentate can be called\r\ncitizens. We have seen that the _Civiltá_ holds it as-beneath their\r\ndignity as ambassadors to the citizens elsewhere than in Rome. Still,\r\nprofessing to be citizens, they were to be pitied. And if they were to\r\nbe pitied, still more was human society to be pitied that had to bear\r\nthe influence of seven hundred masters of a multitude whose consciences\r\nhad come to such a pass. \"A bishop,\" says Quirinus, \"who should show a\r\ntheologian, whose advice he wanted, a passage from the _schema_ under\r\ndiscussion, or who should repeat an expression used in one of the\r\nspeeches, incurs everlasting damnation.... A Papal theologian whom I\r\nquestioned on the subject appealed simply to the statement of Boniface\r\nVIII, that the Pope holds all rights in the shrine of his breast\" (p.\r\n164).\r\n\r\nCount Daru, who now appears on the political stage in Paris, afforded\r\nsome entertainment to Don Margotti, who is to Italy what M. Veuillot\r\nis to France, the leading Papal journalist, having, according to a\r\nsaying of the _Français_, more power than all the bishops. According to\r\nQuirinus the redoubtable pair are \"the two modern Fathers.\" Count Daru\r\nsaid, on January 11, that \"our national maxims in matters of religion,\r\nthe independence of the civil power, and liberty of conscience, cannot\r\nbe menaced.\" This was child's play to Don Margotti. In his view,\r\nFrance needed the new Pope-Suzerain almost as much as Italy needed\r\nthe restoration of the old Pope-King. Don Margotti[279] contends\r\nthat the doctrine of modern parliaments is that they are themselves\r\ninfallible. This he proves by a text from Emile Ollivier. That oracle\r\non one occasion had said \"We are justice!\" but Don Margotti prefers an\r\ninfallible Pope to an infallible people. Menabrea, Sella Minghetti, and\r\nsuch as they in Italy, according to him, represented God, the State.\r\nMargotti, therefore, looks on the _mot_ of Ollivier as\r\n\r\n    providential, for it proves the necessity of an infallible Pope The\r\n    world absolutely needs a permanent and infallible authority; if the\r\n    authority is not the Pope, up starts Ollivier, and ascribes it to\r\n    himself. It is time that infallibility should be defined, that we\r\n    may have no more such absurdities as Ollivier proclaiming \"We are\r\n    justice!\" Oh, let the dogmatic definition of infallibility speedily\r\n    sound from the heights of the Vatican, and free us from modern\r\n    justice, which calls itself now Baroche, now Ollivier!\r\n\r\nFreeing us from modern justice and from M. Emile Ollivier are two\r\ndifferent matters, though it is natural for Don Margotti to hail as\r\nprovidential an opportunity of treating them as one. The assumption\r\nof infallibility by parliaments is rather a favourite notion of\r\nJesuit writers. They seem to mean that any authority which will not\r\nacknowledge its subordination to the Vicar of God must claim to be\r\nitself infallible. Yet, we might deem our own Parliament wiser than\r\nthe Pope and his Curia, and morally superior, and still not think them\r\nanything more than erring mortals, with infallibility some way off. An\r\nEnglish member of Parliament, repeating the Jesuit oracles, says that\r\nour Parliament claims to be infallible.[280] It would seem that no\r\nassertion of the Jesuits is too ridiculous to be seriously repeated by\r\ntheir Oxford converts, though many are kept back, but for other reasons\r\nthan their absurdity. The decree in which the Parliament does declare\r\nits acts irreformable would be a great curiosity. So would even such an\r\nexpression as the following, quoted by Don Margotti (January 18) from\r\nthe archbishops and bishops of the province of Vercelli:--\r\n\r\n    Most Blessed Father, now and always shall we be found, in obedience\r\n    and reverence to your Holiness, approving, and disapproving,\r\n    whatever you, from your apostolic chair, do approve and disapprove;\r\n    from which chair Jesus Christ Himself speaks in the Holy Spirit to\r\n    the bishops and people of the whole world.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the Italian Parliament having been postponed, to give\r\ntime to a new ministry to prepare measures, Don Margotti, viewing the\r\nparalysis of the Parliament as a moral effect of the presence of the\r\nCouncil, said (January 22):--\r\n\r\n    The word of Rome imposes silence at Florence, and the Council of\r\n    the Vatican does just as our Lord once did when He closed the mouth\r\n    of the Sadducees. Gentlemen, you have talked enough. Now stand\r\n    still, and hear the great word of God. Your day is past, the day of\r\n    the powers of darkness; and now the days of the Lord will dawn, the\r\n    days of truth and light.\r\n\r\nThe Address in favour of a definition of the dogma of infallibility\r\nhad now become the talk of all. Vitelleschi (p. 85) states that it\r\nwas carried round by the Archbishop of Westminster, and the Fathers\r\nof the _Civiltá Cattolica_, as the Jesuits are called who form the\r\neditorial college of the great magazine. A letter, inviting adhesions,\r\nand signed by several bishops, chiefly belonging to the class who had\r\nnot any national ties, was circulated with the address. The signatures\r\nto that document itself were headed by the names of Manning, Spalding\r\nof Baltimore, and Senestry. What had been felt from the first was now\r\nopenly declared on all hands, although the utterance of it had often\r\nbeen charged as a great sin upon the Liberal Catholics. We mean, that\r\nthe object of the Council was the definition of Papal infallibility,\r\nand that all the rest was manoeuvring. Brief as are the historical\r\nnotes in the _Acta Sanctæ Sedis_ they state that we may almost say that\r\nthe whole Council was convened for the sake of the fourth session.[281]\r\n\r\nVitelleschi notes the fact that the citations given in the Address to\r\nprove that earlier Councils had propounded Papal infallibility, were\r\nnot apposite. Quirinus says that the Address \"bristles with falsehood.\"\r\nVeuillot, on the other hand, finds its arguments cogent,--indeed,\r\nunanswerable. Vitelleschi remarks that the writers speak with\r\nindifference or contempt of schisms which might arise from the\r\nmeasures they demanded. Friedrich calls it a compound of untruth and\r\nslander. Veuillot urges that the contradictions to the doctrine had now\r\nreached such a head as rendered its definition absolutely necessary.\r\nYet all this contradiction had arisen since the personal organ of the\r\nPope gave the signal for an acclamation.\r\n\r\nThat liberty of the Church which existed nowhere else upon this sinful\r\nearth, except in Ecuador, did exist in Rome; and, therefore, all other\r\nliberties were secured; that is, the liberty of doing everything not\r\nforbidden by divine authority. But printing in Rome, except by licence,\r\nwas forbidden by the authority that never can be in contradiction\r\nto evangelical law. The Address for making that authority into an\r\ninfallible one was, however, circulated in print, without _imprimatur_\r\nof any sort. This sign was understood on all hands. It was not to be\r\nmistaken. The divine authority asked for signatures. The canvass for\r\nthem was keen.\r\n\r\nVitelleschi relates that the promotors of the Address were charged with\r\ndragging a question forward prematurely, which in the natural course\r\nof things, would have come on for discussion when the prerogatives of\r\nthe See of Rome should be considered. To defend themselves, they said\r\nthat the step they had taken was sanctioned by the Cardinal Presidents.\r\nThis \"indiscretion,\" he proceeds to say, \"exposed the Roman Curia\r\nto the reproach of itself begging for its own apotheosis, devoid of\r\nfeelings of the simplest propriety.\" Even the clergy, he thinks, were\r\ndisconcerted at this proceeding, except the Jesuits. These were urged\r\non by a fatality to proclaim \"the infallibility of Clement XIV, who\r\nabolished them, and that of Pius IX, who had almost done so too, while\r\nthey must find a formula to interpret the judgment of the next Pope who\r\nshall abolish them once more.\"\r\n\r\nThis Roman noble accounts for the strange vehemence of Manning on the\r\nground that he had been a Protestant:--\r\n\r\n    He had seen his own religion from within, and not from without;\r\n    and had seen the Catholic religion from without, and not from\r\n    within. In Protestantism he had seen only the infinite internal\r\n    divisions and subdivisions; and in Catholicism he had admired only\r\n    the magnificent effect of its unity. He had not appreciated the\r\n    good results produced by the former, through moderate liberty and\r\n    the constant exercise of private reason and conscience; and he had\r\n    not felt the dangers which, in the latter, flow from excessive\r\n    authority. He is enamoured of authority, as much as the slave is of\r\n    liberty. This want of equilibrium, and of a just Catholic feeling\r\n    in his dealings respecting the Council, was charged against him,\r\n    even by the most faithful and devoted of the clergy in Rome (p. 89;\r\n    Eng. ver., 60).\r\n\r\nA counter Address was sent in from German and Hungarian prelates;\r\none from French, one from Italians, one from Americans, and one from\r\nOrientals. But these, not being in the interest of the Court could not\r\nbe printed without a licence, and could not hope to obtain one. Even\r\nCardinal Rauscher had failed to attain leave to print a short treatise\r\non the Papal infallibility in Latin, and had to send it to Vienna.[282]\r\nSo the Opposition had to dispense with type. Then, what were they to do\r\nwith their Address, when complete? The course of their opponents was\r\nclear--they had only to send in theirs to the Commission on Proposals;\r\nand some, in their bitterness, said that that Commission had been\r\nformed for no other purpose than that of receiving and forwarding it.\r\nBut these Opposition addresses did not propose anything to be done, but\r\nsimply requested the Pope not to have a certain thing proposed. The\r\nbishops had no power to move in the House that the subject should not\r\nbe considered, or to move that it should be deferred till the meeting\r\nof the next General Council. Care had been taken that they should not\r\nhave \"the negative right of proposition\" any more than the positive.\r\nThen, what could they do? Nothing whatever, but what they had done\r\nalready, namely, petition the Pope. Their former petition, indeed,\r\nhad received no answer. Still, that was a request for the recalling\r\nof a _fait accompli_, or, at least, for its modification. This, on\r\nthe other hand, was only a request that a thing suggested should not\r\nbe done. \"Can any more singular relative position be imagined,\" says\r\nVitelleschi,[283] \"than that of a man who receives a number of people\r\ninto his house, with a design of proclaiming his apotheosis, and at the\r\nsame time receives from them a pressing supplication to renounce that\r\nhonour?\"\r\n\r\nNone of these various Addresses stated that the signers opposed the new\r\ndogma only on the ground of opportuneness. This ought to be carefully\r\nnoted. The opposite is now almost always either asserted or assumed;\r\nbut the documents have not perished.[284] Such a position was skilfully\r\navoided. It is quite true that the only grounds, formally stated in all\r\nthe Addresses _but one_, are grounds which might be concurred in by men\r\nwho objected to making the opinion of Papal infallibility into a dogma,\r\nthough they did not object to it as an opinion. But the German Address\r\nwas clearly distinguished from the others. It plainly and forcibly\r\ndemurred to the principle, though couching its objections in terms\r\nof great courtesy. After alluding to questions of opportuneness, the\r\nGerman and Hungarian bishops proceed:--\r\n\r\n    We cannot pass in silence over the fact that other grave\r\n    difficulties exist, arising out of the _dicta_ and the acts of the\r\n    Fathers of the Church, out of genuine historical documents, and out\r\n    of Catholic doctrine itself, which, unless they can be entirely\r\n    removed, it would be impossible that the doctrine commended in the\r\n    above named address should be propounded to the Christian people as\r\n    being revealed of God. Our spirit recoils from the discussion of\r\n    these difficulties; and, confiding in Thy benevolence, we implore\r\n    that the necessity of such deliberations may not be imposed upon us.\r\n\r\nThis is signed by men who speak of themselves as \"prostrate at thy\r\nfeet.\" This passage, however, stood in the German Address alone. The\r\nothers wished to get as many signatures as they could, and perhaps\r\nfancied that they gained ground with the Curia by omitting plain\r\nobjections to the principle. The American Address indicated the\r\nexistence of differences on the point of principle, by alleging as its\r\nfirst reason against raising a discussion on infallibility, that such\r\na discussion would \"clearly show a want of union, and especially of\r\nunanimity among the bishops.\" The German, French, and Italian Addresses\r\nput forward another point, namely, that the dignitaries belonging as\r\nthey did to _the most important Catholic nations_, and knowing the\r\nprobable effects of the proposed measures, felt that those effects,\r\neven with the best men, would be damaging to the cause of the Church,\r\nand would supply unfriendly ones with occasion for new invasions of\r\nher rights.[285] The German address, as printed in the _Documenta_,\r\nhas forty-six signatures, including two Cardinals and the Primate of\r\nHungary; one American prelate Mrak, of Sault Sainte Marie, in Michigan,\r\nclosed the list. The French Address has thirty-eight names, and among\r\nthese are three Portuguese prelates and four Orientals. The Italian\r\nAddress has seven names, the American twenty-seven--among which two\r\nIrish Sees, Kerry and Dromore, are represented, and a single English\r\none, Clifton. The Oriental Address has seventeen.[286]\r\n\r\nM. Veuillot, speaking of the Opposition Addresses as one whole, said\r\nthat of all who had signed it, not two, perhaps not one, was opposed\r\nto infallibility in principle (i. p. 149). Later he had the candour\r\nto attack the bishops for having impugned not only the opportuneness\r\nof the definition, but the doctrine itself (i. p. 180). Archbishop\r\nManning, however, even after the close of the Council, said, \"I have\r\nnever been able to hear of five bishops who denied the doctrine of\r\nPapal infallibility.\"[287] This particular statement is advanced as\r\nevidence of a general one, that the question raised among the bishops\r\n\"was a question of prudence, policy, expediency; not of doctrine or\r\ntruth.\" A question not of doctrine or of truth! Forty-six prelates in\r\na petition expressly directed against Dr. Manning's own Address had\r\nput the question as one not only of prudence, but of revealed truth,\r\nalleging against any attempt to define the dogma three classes of\r\nobstacles--those arising out of Catholic doctrine, out of the _dicta_\r\nand acts of the Fathers, and out of historical documents. Perhaps\r\nwe ought, with the forty-six prelates, to say _genuine_ historical\r\ndocuments. But Englishmen must be forgiven if in their limited\r\nintercourse with the Papacy they have not yet found it necessary to put\r\nlabels on such words. The Donations of Constantine, and the Decretals\r\nof the Pseudo-Isidore, are historical documents, and also genuine as\r\nspecimens of forgeries.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the Opposition petition is wrapped in mystery. Who\r\npresented it? how was it received? what became of it? are questions\r\nto which the satisfactory answer must be left to time. Some asserted\r\nthat the Pope refused to receive it. Quirinus says that he returned it\r\n(p. 174). M. Veuillot told how it was delivered at the Vatican by an\r\nordinary messenger, and that a monsignore received it with ordinary\r\npapers. This public affront to two Cardinals and nearly a hundred\r\nand forty bishops was aggravated a few days later by the remark that\r\nit was not yet known whether the monsignore had ever thought well\r\nto deliver the Address. Still later it was said that the Pope being\r\nconsulted as to what was to be done with it, said that it might go to\r\nthe Commission on Proposals, he intending, personally, to ignore it\r\n(i. p. 202). At a yet later date, January 28, Friedrich learned that\r\nevery one being afraid to present it. Cardinal Schwarzenberg sent it\r\nby his chamberlain, who delivered it to Monsignor Ricci, the Pope's\r\nchamberlain. The Pope was excessively angry, and ordered it to be sent\r\nto the Commission.\r\n\r\nWhen M. Veuillot trumpeted forth this example of how to deal with\r\ncardinals, archbishops, and bishops, did he mean to suggest that other\r\nCourts might treat them with like neglect,--Courts to which these\r\nofficials hold themselves related as citizens only in an inferior\r\norder, an order which \"obliges\" them only when the higher order does\r\nnot contravene? The documents in question bore the signatures of the\r\nSees of Prague, Vienna, Munich, Cologne, Mainz; those of Milan and\r\nTurin; those of Paris, Rheims, Orleans, and the principal Sees of\r\nPortugal; those of New York, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Halifax, and St.\r\nJohn; those of Kerry and Dromore, and of Clifton; and from ancient\r\ncountries the signatures of Antioch, Babylon, Tyre, Sidon, and\r\nSeleucia. Not often in the history of manners have titles representing\r\nso many ancient claims and such considerable modern station been\r\ntreated with equal discourtesy.\r\n\r\nThe _Univers_ of January 30[288] said that when the minority thought\r\nthat the majority were about to come to a decisive vote, they sent\r\nBishop Freppel, or some one else, to propose conciliation; but when\r\nreassured, they began their opposition afresh. It further said that\r\nCardinal Hohenlohe acted in Rome in the interests of his brother, the\r\nMinister, and that his theologian, Friedrich, who had been chosen by\r\nDöllinger, was the writer of the letters in the _Augsburg Gazette_;\r\nthat Cardinal Hohenlohe, with Schwarzenberg and Haynald, had succeeded\r\nin making an impression at certain embassies; and that the Austrian\r\nambassador put the petition against infallibility before bishops, and\r\nasked if they had signed it.\r\n\r\nNot content with the far-reaching policy which aimed ultimately at a\r\ncosmopolitan counter-revolution, the party of movement desired to begin\r\nforthwith by a local counter-revolution. Italy was to be reconstituted\r\nas a confederation of four States--the Papal States, Naples, Tuscany,\r\nand Piedmont. This, cries Friedrich, is a new task for a Council,--a\r\nCouncil called to make a revolution![289] But the bishops knew more of\r\nthe world than the Curia.\r\n\r\nParty spirit now ran high. Those who had adopted the tactics of\r\nopposing infallibility only on the ground of opportuneness, while\r\nthey really objected on principle, found that they had gained nothing\r\nin point of conciliation, and had lost almost everything in point\r\nof moral power. How could ordinary consciences understand a man\r\nwho admitted, or seemed to admit, that a doctrine, affecting the\r\nrepresentative of God on earth, was true, and yet denied that it\r\nought to be proclaimed? Compared with this position, that of the Pope\r\nwas bold sensible and Christian. \"We must never fear to proclaim the\r\ntruth or to condemn error.\" Many, as well as Dupanloup, who first\r\ndeparted from the false line that he had seemed to mark out, found that\r\nthey must object to the principle. Even if they had not previously\r\nstudied the question at all, the glaring attempts now made to palm off\r\nadmissions of primacy for assertions of infallibility opened their\r\neyes. An ex-Anglican like Manning might easily accept that or grosser\r\nfallacies, but others had been taught to distinguish. The party of\r\nmovement, on the other hand, raised a cry for action, which swelled\r\nhigher at every sign of opposition. Their allegations are briefly\r\nexpressed by Sambin (p. 105):--\r\n\r\n    Pontifical infallibility is the sign to be spoken against. If it\r\n    is defined, the question is near to its settlement. The Catholic\r\n    social Liberalism of France, and the scientific Liberalism of\r\n    Germany, are indeed menaced. It is, therefore, a question of life\r\n    or death for Liberalism, as for Gallicanism and Febronianism.\r\n\r\nThe opposition to \"the divine prerogatives of the Pontiff,\" says this\r\nauthor,[290] \"had now become so pronounced that it was necessary to\r\nact.\"[291] Saviours of society always come to that point on the eve of\r\nthe _coup d'état_.\r\n\r\nM. Veuillot, who had long endeavoured to smother the opposition by\r\nasserting that no opposition existed, now declared that the opposition\r\nwas so grave that it made the proposed definition a necessity. Quirinus\r\nsays that the Address in favour of infallibility owes its preponderance\r\nof signatures principally to the three hundred _boarders_ and the South\r\nAmericans, while the counter-address represents \"the overwhelming\r\npredominance in numbers of souls, in intelligence, and in national\r\nimportance\" (p. 173). One topic of constant complaint on the part of\r\nthe Opposition was the disproportionate number of bishops to people in\r\nItaly as compared with other nations. For the seven hundred thousand\r\npeople then in the Papal States there were sixty-two bishops, while\r\nfor the twelve million Catholics of Germany there were fourteen. One\r\nmillion seven hundred thousand in the diocese of Breslau had but a\r\nsingle prelate, and he was not placed on any committee whatever. The\r\nnine millions of ignorant and superstitious people in Naples and\r\nSicily had no less than sixty-eight bishops. On the other side of this\r\nquestion, M. Veuillot played off the name of London. If Paris and\r\nVienna, Munich and Lyons, Milan and Turin, were on the wrong side, the\r\nArchbishop of London was on the right one.\r\n\r\nSpalding, Archbishop of Baltimore, issued a project for a decree which,\r\nwithout formally defining the dogma of infallibility, should bind all\r\nto an interior assent to the infallibility of Papal decrees in faith\r\nor morals. He pointed out the evils attendant on a formal definition,\r\nand that in a manner which afterwards enlivened the controversy between\r\nDupanloup, Deschamps, and himself. The work wherewith Deschamps\r\nregaled his Christmas Day was that of proposing no less than ten\r\n_anathemas_;[292] for if the Fathers could not propose things in\r\nCouncil, they could send a suggestion to the committee. Ten new\r\nanathemas dated expressly on the Nativity of our Lord by a Christian\r\nbishop! That day Reisach died.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 272: \"A French prelate, commenting upon the text of this\r\ndiscourse, sneered at the simpletons who allowed themselves to be led\r\nby a one-eyed man (_un borgne_).

It had taken three hundred years to\r\ndevelop the practical effects of the legislation of Trent in curtailing\r\nthose rights. Paolo Sarpi may say that the prelates entered Trent as\r\nbishops and left it as parsons; but it was long before new regulations\r\nhad worn down old procedure so far that an Archbishop of Paris, for\r\ninstance, could be treated in the manner in which we have seen Darboy\r\ntreated. The bishops, however, now feared, says Vitelleschi, lest their\r\noffice should be further mutilated.\r\n\r\nAccording to Friedrich (p. 88), when, at one of the first meetings of\r\nthe German and Hungarian prelates, Strossmayer said that the matter\r\nbefore them was the resignation of their collective rights and the\r\ncentring of the whole in the hands of the Pope, he was ridiculed;\r\nbut when he repeated that statement, on Saturday, January 8, it was\r\nreceived with universal assent. On the other hand, Roman ecclesiastics\r\nwere alarmed at the pretensions of the bishops. Two Dominicans begged\r\nCardinal Hohenlohe to use his influence to prevent the Germans from\r\nspeaking as extravagantly as the French. \"It is really frightful,\"\r\nthey said; \"what is to become of Rome? These bishops want spiritual\r\ndecentralization.\" Friedrich now thinks that he begins to see what is\r\nthe religious principle of the Roman clergy--domination, as a means of\r\nexistence. The bearing of this remark on spiritual decentralization\r\nrests on the fact that spiritual causes referred to Rome bring money\r\nto the bureaux, and the bureaucracy are the clergy.\r\n\r\nThe professional observations of Friedrich on the Drafts touching\r\ndiscipline give insight into certain interior aspects of Romanism,\r\nwhich affect not only its own condition, but, through it, affect all\r\nsociety. We therefore let him speak directly (p. 89 ff.)--\r\n\r\n    The first chapter on the Office of a Bishop closes so abruptly\r\n    that only at the end is it said that bishops must be examples for\r\n    the flock. It is, however, praiseworthy that they are told to\r\n    take the lead of the faithful even in knowledge. Alas for this\r\n    pious wish: It will be as it has been! Further on, the words \"let\r\n    ecclesiastical discipline be maintained\" strike the eye, and that\r\n    in respect of the _mulieres subintroductæ_, or γυναἱκες σονεἱσακτοι, in\r\n    which character the parsonage cooks appear. This\r\n    regulation is the most insulting imaginable; the most degrading\r\n    for the parish priest, the most lowering and humiliating for the\r\n    curates; altogether a dark spot in Church life. No regulation\r\n    stands in such glaring contrast with Canons and Councils. It is a\r\n    great offence against Christian morality, by which it is forbidden\r\n    that any one should be placed in proximate occasion of sin; but\r\n    in this manner the independence of a clergyman, and the placing\r\n    of him in proximate occasion of sin, are connected together. The\r\n    Fathers of the Council must themselves say whether this is or is\r\n    not the greatest of cankers in the life of the clergy. They can\r\n    tell whether it is necessary to direct the attention of the Council\r\n    to this sore spot. One of the Fathers of the Council himself told\r\n    me that he once spent a night in a parsonage where the rural dean\r\n    (Dechant) and the cook were parents of both curates. It is said\r\n    in the Draft, _De vita et honestate clericorum_: \"If a clergyman,\r\n    unmindful of his own dignity, is given to immodest defilements or\r\n    to impure concubinage, or dares either in his house or elsewhere\r\n    to have a woman of whom suspicion may be entertained, or to seek\r\n    her company, let him be proceeded against, with the penalties\r\n    prescribed by the sacred Canons, especially by the Council of\r\n    Trent, and that without noise or the forms of a trial, only by\r\n    simple inquiry into the truth of the facts.\" But what will this\r\n    avail? Those directions have long existed, yet things go on as of\r\n    old, and any such directions must necessarily be insufficient. Why\r\n    is not the regulation of the ancient Church once more taken up, and\r\n    carried through with a firm hand, according to which every woman,\r\n    except nearest relations, was suspected, and was not to be admitted\r\n    to the house of a clergyman? If our Church-princes of to-day\r\n    will not return to the old regulation, which indeed sufficed not\r\n    to hinder all excesses, and if they are incapable of finding new\r\n    and better ones, it would be preferable, at all events, and would\r\n    involve less responsibility for them, if they allowed their clergy\r\n    to marry outright rather than give them up to arrangements which\r\n    place their reputation in so ambiguous a light. The fact that this\r\n    subject had to be brought forward here in its regular place is sad\r\n    enough, and should be taken as proof that we cannot go on in the\r\n    present way. Has it not already come to this, in certain dioceses,\r\n    that the bishops find themselves obliged to hush up, rather than to\r\n    punish?\r\n\r\n    Further on, in the same chapter, it is said, \"While they preach\r\n    to the people due reverence and obedience towards the powers of\r\n    this world, let them all with one mind and heart, taking counsel\r\n    together and uniting their deliberations and strength, earnestly\r\n    maintain the rights of the Church and of this Holy See, so that\r\n    their common guard and defence may more perfectly assure the\r\n    interests of the common cause; but let them admit of nothing\r\n    which will lower the honour and dignity of their rank, and let\r\n    them keep the admonitions of the Council of Trent on this point\r\n    under their eye.\" These sentences are doubtless well meant; but,\r\n    practically, will be without result. Nothing is gained by such\r\n    general propositions. This being self-evident, nothing should be\r\n    said in Decrees of a Council beyond the laying down of positive\r\n    directions. The conclusion of the chapter is vague, but, perhaps,\r\n    very dangerous. \"We require princes and magistrates to cover and\r\n    protect the sacred chief pastors (antistites) and ministers of\r\n    the Church, and their most excellent work, with their powerful\r\n    patronage and defence, _that due honour, respect, and obedience\r\n    may be paid by all to the ecclesiastical authority_. Knowing that\r\n    bishops promote not only the cause of the Church, but also that\r\n    of their nations, and that above all the boldness and wickedness\r\n    of men who perversely seek to mislead minds and corrupt manners\r\n    may be restrained and constrained by them in the exercise of their\r\n    pastoral office.\"\r\n\r\n    First of all, what is meant here by most excellent or highest work\r\n    (_optimum operant_)? who are included in _by all_ (_ab omnibus_)?\r\n    Not only is honour to be paid to the spiritual authority by all,\r\n    but obedience. According to the notes, _by all_ includes princes\r\n    and nations; that by the Council princes and nations may be moved\r\n    to venerate the sacred pastors, and to render them obedience\r\n    and reverence. Are we to understand that the unbelievers and\r\n    misbelievers in a State are to pay obedience to the bishops? Does\r\n    this wrap up the mediæval notion that heretics after all are under\r\n    the jurisdiction of the Catholic Church, as Bishop Martin lately\r\n    gave himself out as the bishop of the heretics in his diocese?\r\n    Also that unbelievers have no moral right of existence, and so on?\r\n    And what is meant by the concluding words? Do they imply that the\r\n    bishops have a right of interfering with the freedom of the press,\r\n    of belief, and of conscience as granted by modern constitutions? A\r\n    General Council should speak clearly and definitely.[293]\r\n\r\n    But who would have believed that in the second chapter on the\r\n    Residence of Bishops a condemnation of the constitutional usages\r\n    of modern times should be attempted, even indirectly? It provides\r\n    that bishops must not be absent from their sees more than two,\r\n    or at the utmost three, months in a year, whether continuously\r\n    or at intervals. Such absence cannot be allowed even for causes\r\n    otherwise admitted as lawful--_alias jure admissis_--except by\r\n    express permission of the Pope, or, in the United Greek Churches\r\n    without the permission of the Patriarch. One is here compelled\r\n    to ask, Could not those cases have been foreseen in which seats\r\n    in Upper Houses are permanently connected with many bishoprics.\r\n    Why this needless increase of requests for dispensation? But,\r\n    according to the _Civiltá Cattolica_, it is only as compelled by\r\n    existing circumstances that bishops can properly take part in the\r\n    objectionable constitutional life. It is said in the notes that the\r\n    necessity of an express apostolic permission is to be remembered\r\n    as being even now required by the constitution of Boniface\r\n    VIII--_Sancta synodus_--even if there exists one of the four\r\n    grounds of absence admitted as legitimate by the Council of Trent\r\n    in its twenty-third session. These four grounds were, visiting the\r\n    thresholds of the apostles (_i.e._ Rome), attending provincial\r\n    synods, attending a General Assembly in which ecclesiastics\r\n    are wont to sit, or discharging an office or duty to the State\r\n    connected with the Churches themselves. But (says the note) because\r\n    the Decrees of Urban VIII contemplate assemblies of a kind which do\r\n    not at present exist, mention of this as a just cause of absence\r\n    was omitted in the Decree, in which also was omitted, for a similar\r\n    reason, mention of discharging an office or duty to the State.\r\n    Thus the Chambers which have taken the place of those ancient\r\n    assemblies do not exist for the Curia, or it feels bound to ignore\r\n    them--quite in harmony with Jesuit fantasies. Should the session of\r\n    the Chamber last more than three months, those Bavarian bishops who\r\n    are members of the Reichsrath would require an express permission\r\n    from the Pope to fulfil their duty to the State. They might receive\r\n    from the Pope a prohibition against staying any longer at the\r\n    Reichsrath and fulfilling their obligations as citizens. Very\r\n    edifying for our governments and States! They, however, would know\r\n    how to help themselves, and would simply withdraw such a seat from\r\n    the bishop.\r\n\r\nFriedrich then dwells on the new contrivance of centralization by\r\nwhich every metropolitan is ordered, before publishing the acts of a\r\nProvincial Synod, to send them to Rome. The Curia is not to give them\r\nany formal approbation, but to _correct them_, should anything seem\r\nto call for correction. After this they are to be issued as the acts\r\nof the Provincial Synod. To execute this feat of shaping provincial\r\ndecrees within the chambers of the Curia, Pius IX had appointed a\r\nnew Board or Congregation. Friedrich calls this a new censorship.\r\nThat would appear to mean that whereas formerly only private authors\r\nrequired an _imprimatur_, now even the collective episcopate of a\r\nprovince requires one. It would, however, seem to involve more than a\r\ncensorship, because the new matter inserted in Rome has to go before\r\nthe world under the provincial names. Authors were not compelled\r\nto father the corrections of the censor. They could leave the work\r\nunpublished.\r\n\r\nThat sense of impending danger to the Church which, of late years,\r\nhad weighed on many Catholics, arose not a little from the moral\r\nteaching of the Jesuits, whose influence, under the smile of the\r\nPope, they saw gradually rising. Out of regard for the honour of the\r\nChurch, many Roman Catholics suppressed the horror they felt at what\r\nthey discovered in the books of the Jesuits. Only those who have read\r\nsome books--those which reflect the modern phases of their moral\r\nteaching--can appreciate the weight that must have lain on the hearts\r\nof some good men when striving to uphold before their imagination the\r\nChurch as the perfection of beauty. Among the disciples of the Church\r\nof Rome are many who hold close to the Christian side of her theology,\r\nand seem to forget its Pagan side; many who avoid what is material in\r\nher cult, and, by aid of that same theology, cherish spiritual worship;\r\nmany who turn to the noble morals of the Gospel, from the lower and\r\never deteriorating morals of the schools; and many to whom the secular\r\nspirit of the Papacy and the earthly empire aimed at by the Jesuits are\r\nrepugnant.\r\n\r\nFriedrich learned, in Rome, that those who confess to the Jesuits are\r\nnot to be trusted. Any one who will read even one hundred pages out\r\nof the seven hundred of Gury's _Casus Conscientiæ_ would not think of\r\ntrusting--would only think of pitying any creature into whose head\r\nthe principles of that bad book had been put. Friedrich evidently\r\ndoes not repeat any light talk when he says that he heard it stated,\r\nupon good authority, that the Jesuits in Rome were in the habit of\r\nemploying women as lures to procure the overthrow of men who stood in\r\ntheir way, which women would then return to the Jesuit confessionals as\r\npenitent Magdalenes; and this, he adds, the Pope knows right well. When\r\nVitelleschi speaks of the evils arising from severity against errors of\r\nthe intellect, and indulgence to errors of the will, he means what we\r\nshould describe as strictness as to Papal principles, and laxity as to\r\nmoral practices.\r\n\r\nAccording to Vitelleschi, Darboy had only to stretch out his hand to\r\ntake a Cardinal's hat. The impression that this was the case, and\r\nthe terms on which he was known to stand with the Curia, gave great\r\ninterest to his first appearance in the desk, which took place on\r\nJanuary 19. How gladly would the Curia have seen him stretch forth his\r\nhand in the direction where the hat hung; but no, he reached it out in\r\nthat direction where he had only reproaches to gather.[294]\r\n\r\n    We are told that we are not to make long speeches, but I have a\r\n    great deal to say. We are told again not to repeat what has been\r\n    said by others; but at the same time we are kept shut up in this\r\n    Hall, where for the most part we cannot understand one another;\r\n    we are not allowed to examine the stenographic reports of our\r\n    speeches, and the only answer made to our representations is always\r\n    the same, \"The Pope wills it.\" I do not know, therefore, what has\r\n    been said by the speakers who have preceded me.\r\n\r\nHe then went on to speak of the rights of the bishops, of their\r\ndegradation by the Roman centralizing system, of \"the caves wherein the\r\nRoman doctors have buried themselves from the light of day,\" etc. Two\r\nsayings are ascribed to him after this speech. The first, \"Like Condé,\r\nI have thrown my marshal's baton into the midst of the enemy;\" and the\r\nsecond, \"This Hall is deaf, dumb, and blind.\" Hard as it was for the\r\nCuria to listen to Darboy, with his diocese of two millions of nominal\r\nCatholics, it is said that they were even more pained by the language\r\nof Melchers of Cologne, whose diocese counted one million, and from\r\nwhom animadversions were not expected. The fear of the French troops\r\nforsaking Rome saved the Archbishop of Paris from the tinkling of the\r\nmystic bell; but it arrested the metropolitan of the Rhine Province.\r\n\r\nMelchers strongly objected to the increase of centralization in\r\nRome, and advocated decentralization. He declared that, as now\r\nemployed, dispensations from Rome were not necessary. Cardinal De Luca\r\ninterrupted him, and told him that he was not speaking to the point,\r\nand that he must send his proposals to the Commission. He replied that\r\nhe had sent his proposals to Rome long ago, and had received no answer;\r\nand then proceeded with his speech. An attack on centralization and on\r\ndispensations, from such a prelate, was a practical matter in Rome, as\r\nmuch as in Manchester would be a movement to cut off all the customers\r\nin some great county.\r\n\r\nOn January 23 and 24, Cardinal Hohenlohe gave two dinner parties--the\r\nfirst to Fallibilists, and the second to Infallibilists. At the former,\r\nHefele, who now reappears on the scene, no longer as theologian, but as\r\nBishop of Rottenburg, complained that he had lost the important sitting\r\nof that morning through an order from Cardinal Antonelli to attend\r\nthe baptism of a child of the ex-Duke of Parma, which eleven other\r\nprelates who like him had apartments in the Quirinal were also obliged\r\nto attend, and at which six Cardinals gave their presence.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Melchers of Cologne did not flatter Friedrich by telling\r\nhim, what he already knew, that his Grace had forbidden his theological\r\nstudents to go to the faculty at Munich. His Grace, says Friedrich,\r\ndid know the name of Döllinger, but not that of Reithmayer; and as to\r\nthose of the younger professors, not the name of one. The Archbishop of\r\nMunich was not able to resist the temptation of telling Friedrich, as\r\na good story, that when the bishops at Fulda, in the previous autumn,\r\nspoke of recommending Friedrich's Church History to the clergy, as a\r\nwork which they ought to procure, his Grace of Cologne confessed that\r\nhe did not know the name of the book. The pendant which the author\r\narchly hangs to this tale is, that when the copy of that work which he\r\nhad presented to his Grace of Munich fell, after some years, again into\r\nhis hands, it had never been opened.\r\n\r\nBishop Förster of Breslau mentioned how Ketteler was going to propose,\r\nin the meeting of German and Hungarian prelates, that they should\r\ndisavow the letters in the _Augsburg Gazette_; but, said Förster, we\r\nstand too high, and besides, the letters contain too many truths. Some\r\none at table threw out the idea that the best thing to be done would\r\nbe to give the Drafts of Decrees to the bishops, and let them go home\r\nand study them for a year or two, and then return and discuss them.\r\nThey had come to Rome without books. Points of the greatest gravity in\r\ndoctrine and discipline were laid before them for decision, and, as\r\nevery one knew, it was difficult to find help in the libraries of Rome.\r\nEven that of the Vatican was closed, not only upon every holy day, but\r\nalso on all those days on which General Congregations were held. The\r\nbishops were not allowed to take either books or manuscripts out of\r\nthe libraries; still more, both in the Vatican library and the Vatican\r\narchives, the order had been given that nothing bearing on the Council\r\nshould be delivered to them. Their regret at this was lessened by the\r\ndiscovery that the libraries contained scarcely any modern theological\r\nworks, especially German ones. In his day, Addison remarked that\r\nbooks were not the attractions you went to see in an Italian library.\r\nBut, of recent years, a real library of books, in addition to the old\r\ncelebrated one of manuscripts, had been added at the Vatican. It was\r\nnot catalogued, and was not open to the public. Some one in the company\r\nstated that it was now understood that theologians were to be brought\r\ninto the Council in order to defend the Drafts of Decrees. So far as\r\nthe _Theologi Minores_, or doctors, were concerned, Friedrich thought\r\nthis improbable; and as to the higher theologians, or bishops, he\r\nwondered who they were to be. Can any one fancy, he said, such a man as\r\nSenestrey being treated as a theologian? At Trent, with the ideas then\r\nprevailing of what constituted a theologian, he would not have been\r\ndreamed of; but he passes in Rome as learned because he is a pupil and\r\na favourite of the Jesuits; and by their standard, indeed, adds his\r\ncountryman, he may even pass as holy, understanding so well as he does\r\nthe principle that the end sanctifies the means.\r\n\r\nAs to what Friedrich next relates, we can only say that the ascertained\r\nfact for history, in her present stage, is that the following are\r\nthings which a learned professor, with a position and character to take\r\ncare of, deliberately publishes, things which the gravest men receive.\r\nFriedrich relates how when Senestrey was seeking the bishopric, King\r\nMaximilian II was in Rome, and often visited Theiner, whose fame all\r\nGermans prized. His rooms in the Vatican, off the _Via dei Giardini\r\nPontificali_, well known to scholars, are often pointed out to visitors\r\ngoing up towards the sculpture gallery by the present circuitous\r\napproach. Here the royal visitor would chat with the learned Prefect\r\nof the Archives, and enjoy the landscape. At that time Theiner had no\r\nbetter friend than Senestrey, who, knowing that Theiner was in bad\r\nodour with the Jesuits, showed himself very hostile to them, so that\r\neven his experienced friend confessed to Friedrich that he had allowed\r\nhimself to be deceived. This Roman tale is followed by a Bavarian one.\r\nA person well acquainted with official circles told Friedrich that\r\nSenestrey actually offered his services to the government, saying\r\nthat if appointed bishop, in case the other prelates ever entertained\r\nanything disagreeable to the government, he would give information and\r\ndo everything to counterwork them. In January, 1872, Friedrich heard\r\nSenestrey named in a company where one was present who had been a\r\ncompanion of King Maximilian II on his journey to Rome, and who broke\r\nout saying--\r\n\r\n    Yes, that man talked so much in Rome to King Maximilian II and his\r\n    suite against the Jesuits and against the misgovernment of Rome,\r\n    that the King said, That is the right man! He must be the bishop!\r\n\r\nNo sooner was he in the bishopric than it proved that the king had lost\r\nhis subject, the government its supporter, Theiner his friend, and that\r\nthe whole of Senestrey belonged to the Jesuits.\r\n\r\nThe company of the second day, January 24, consisted of Infallibilists.\r\nBefore dinner Friedrich was introduced to Senestrey, who looking at\r\nhim, said roughly, \"So you are Professor Friedrich,\" and turned his\r\nback. At table Ketteler broke out in loud denunciation of the letters\r\nof Quirinus. This Friedrich knew was meant for him, for although the\r\nbishop has since then laid the sin at the door of Lord Acton, he\r\nseems at that time to have suspected Friedrich. He blamed a statement\r\nthat a certain piece of distinctive attire, not worn by any other\r\nbishop in the West, had been granted to Bishop Lavigerie of Algiers\r\nto adorn his shoulders, as a means of winning his vote; as if, said\r\nKetteler, the whole episcopate was to be bought by a bit of dress! We\r\ndo not remember that Quirinus said that they were all to be bought\r\nby it. Our impression is that he only said something to the effect\r\nthat it was incredible how far that sort of thing did go with them.\r\nConsidering their training and habits, with us the thing incredible\r\nwould be that things of that sort should not go far with them. And\r\ntheir constant study is to make things of that sort go far with all\r\nmankind. But the sally of Ketteler was responded to by the Military\r\nBishop of Prussia, Namszanowski, who might be supposed to be even more\r\nthan others susceptible of colour and decoration. He, evidently not\r\nbeing well read in Quirinus, missed the point of Ketteler's protest,\r\nand said, \"Quite right, brother of Mainz. The same offer was made\r\nto me just at the outset, but I repelled such an imputation with\r\ncontempt.\" This luckless reply probably made Friedrich think of his own\r\nvisit from the much-vested Count Prelate W----. The eye of Ketteler\r\nflashed. Friedrich, who sat next to Namszanowski, hinted that he had\r\nmissed the point of Bishop Ketteler, who ranted on--_tobte weiter_.\r\nWhen he had finished his tirade he looked Friedrich in the eye, as\r\nif to see whether he was not well abashed. \"But I had no occasion\r\nto fear Ketteler, and looked him in the eye quite as sharply.\" Just\r\nafter coffee the voice of Ketteler made the room ring,--\"The chief\r\nadvantage of the Council so far is, that the bishops learn to know one\r\nanother, and to compare experience. For in his own diocese, of course,\r\na bishop never hears the truth from his clergy, in consequence of his\r\nimmeasurably higher jurisdiction.\" Friedrich, being the only priest\r\npresent, said to Namszanowski, \"Ketteler must lead a pretty regiment,\r\nwhen his clergy dare not tell him the truth. Any one who wants to\r\nhear the truth, and can bear to hear it, will hear it.\" He added that\r\nwere it not for the impropriety of provoking a scene in the house of\r\nCardinal Hohenlohe, he would indignantly repel this insult to the whole\r\nof the lower clergy. None of the bishops intimated any dissent from the\r\nview of Ketteler, while Senestrey, and Leonrod of Eichstädt, simpered\r\napprobation. But here Friedrich inserts a note saying, Time has shown\r\nthat Ketteler knew the lower clergy better than I did.\r\n\r\nJust at this time came another token that the content or indifference\r\nwith which the Roman Catholic world watched the impending change in\r\nits Church and creed was broken in exceptional cases. An accomplished\r\nFrench oratorian, a member of the Academy, Father Gratry, published a\r\nletter on January 18, which in almost any other country than France,\r\ncoming from such a man on such a subject, at such a moment, would have\r\ncaused, not a passing talk, but a profound impression. All the abuse\r\nwas no longer for Döllinger and Montalembert. Father Gratry had a\r\nshare allotted to him, sufficient to prove his importance. \"Does God\r\nneed your lies?\" was a question he repeated with solemnity, as he\r\ndwelt on the false decretals and on the falsifications even of the\r\nbreviary. His French clearness and point sent these reproaches home so\r\nas to be extremely cutting. It seemed as if accusing \"the Church\" of\r\nlying and forgery was a sin not to be forgiven. Few things were more\r\ndiscouraging for those who hoped that moral ground still remained for\r\na reformation within the Church of Rome, than the perfect ease with\r\nwhich the benefits of the lying and the forgery were accepted, and the\r\nfury with which the crime of mentioning those incidents was denounced.\r\n\"False decretals as much as you like,\" said Veuillot, \"but the sense of\r\nthe false decretals is the faith of the Church\";[295] so, if God had\r\nnot needed the lies the Church had assimilated them. Father Gratry,\r\nsaid the _Civiltá_, never tires of calling the school which teaches\r\npontifical infallibility, a school of error. Does he know where that\r\nschool has fixed its abode, and holds its chair? If he does not know,\r\nwe shall tell him. \"Its home is Rome, its chair is that of the Roman\r\nPontiff, is that of St. Peter.\"[296] Father Hyacinth said, at a later\r\ntime, \"God never has need of lies, but lies often have need of God,\r\nand they are never so powerful as when they present themselves in His\r\nname.\"[297]\r\n\r\nStill, the weight of wrath continued to fall upon the original\r\noffender. The _Unitá Cattolica_ of January 25, in the letter of its\r\nMunich correspondent, called Döllinger a bag of wind and a whited\r\nsepulchre, and suggested that the Archbishop of Munich should prohibit\r\ntheological students from attending his classes. The _Unitá_ shows that\r\nDr. Döllinger in his works \"has always hidden a rebellious spirit under\r\na learning which was often that of a charlatan.\"\r\n\r\nIn the General Congregation of the 21st, as the Cyprian Archbishop who\r\nsaid Mass used the Oriental rite, the Fathers would have been unable\r\nto follow, but the Master of the Ceremonies, lifting up his voice,\r\ngave a signal for each important movement.[298] In the Congregation of\r\nthe Monday, Strossmayer spoke for an hour and a quarter (_Tagebuch_,\r\np. 133). He insisted that reform was called for, and reform from the\r\nPope downwards, and moreover that the whole of the canon law should\r\nbe reformed. On the following Tuesday, this last proposition was\r\nsupported by the Bishop of Saluzzo. On the same day, a speaker not\r\nnamed regretted that the word \"concubinage\" should have been used,\r\nas it gave occasion to the world to say that celibacy was a failure.\r\nFriedrich, while vehemently sharing this regret, admits that no means\r\nwere suggested for doing away with concubinage or immorality. The\r\nCuria, however, could not be blamed for the scandal caused by the\r\ndiscussion on this matter of discipline. No one of the official organs\r\never breathed a word on the subject. Monsignor Guérin, whose history,\r\nsays the preface to the second edition, reproduces the Council entire,\r\nmight never have heard of this subject, and the same is the case with\r\nSambin. The _Acta Sanctæ Sedis_, even in Latin, are equally reserved.\r\nThe title of the Draft Decree on the general subject of the life of the\r\nclergy is mentioned in _Frond_. Henceforth we cease to be able to check\r\nthe statements of the unauthorized writers by those of the _Acta Sanctæ\r\nSedis_ as to the names of those who spoke on given days. That amount\r\nof information was no more afforded. One day the record was that five\r\nspoke, another seven, and so forth. Who the speakers were, what they\r\nspoke upon, what they said about it, were matters swallowed up in the\r\npontifical secret.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, the challenge to the College of Cardinals to reform\r\nitself was taken up by Cardinal Di Pietro, who admitted that such a\r\ndemand might have been reasonable at Trent, at which time the Cardinals\r\nheld many pluralities, but at the present day it was groundless. The\r\nonly reform now called for was a financial one, as the revenue of the\r\nCardinals was not adequate. He told the Fathers that if they only knew\r\nall, the Cardinals were not to be envied. This even Friedrich admits,\r\nsaying that not once during the Council had the Pope summoned them to\r\nhear their opinions.\r\n\r\nOn January 27, Simor, Primate of Hungary, spoke on the life of the\r\nclergy, and recommended the \"common life.\" Martin of Paderborn also\r\nadvised that the cooks[299] should be superseded, and that \"common\r\nlife\" should be resorted to. Martin had appealed to Cardinal Hohenlohe\r\nto support him in a proposal that Protestant clergymen who wanted to\r\njoin the Church of Rome should have both marriage and the cup in the\r\nLord's Supper conceded to them. Verot, Bishop of Savannah, spoke on\r\nthe breviary. He urged revision, stating that he durst not, without\r\nsubjecting himself to condemnation, say what was in the breviary from\r\nAugustine. Hereupon the bell of Cardinal De Angelis rang loudly, and\r\nVerot was told that the Fathers could not be spoken of in that manner.\r\nAs we understand Verot, he had not found fault with the Fathers. The\r\nsons would not allow one another to say what the fathers had said. The\r\nAmerican waited a moment, went on, and said the same thing of Gregory\r\nthe Great. Now came a second call to order, and he was told that if\r\nhe would not speak on another subject, he must leave the desk. So,\r\nafter a few words more, he did leave it (_Tagebuch_, p. 138). The\r\nPrince Archbishop of Olmütz asked if the Primate of Hungary was ready\r\nto lead the \"common life\" with the canons of his chapter, adding that\r\nhe should not object to lead it with his own chapter, but he feared\r\nthat the canons of Olmütz would object. The following day, Melchers of\r\nCologne supported the views of Verot as to the breviary. He censured\r\nthe proposal to introduce lay brothers into the parsonages instead of\r\nthe cooks. It would be better it the latter could be altogether got\r\nrid of; but as that was scarcely to be expected, it would be well to\r\nrequire that they should be fifty years of age, or at least forty. On\r\nJanuary 31, Bishop Dinkel of Augsburg is said to have spoken against\r\nconcubinage in the strict sense, but allowing it to the clergy in a\r\nwider sense.[300]\r\n\r\nPerhaps, as, about the middle of January, men in the _Englisher\r\nGarten_, or Park, of Munich, lifted their hats to the Provost as he\r\ntook his afternoon walks, they might fancy that the spare figure\r\nwas weighted with rather more than a scholar's gravity. Neither the\r\npassing carriages, nor the race _of Isar rolling rapidly_; neither the\r\nfine effects of the westering sun behind the steeples of the city,\r\nnor the pleasant view from the brow beyond the river, could fix the\r\nold man's well-lighted eye. That eye was then watching the process\r\nwhich was putting the faith and labour of seventy years to a cruel\r\ntest. The Church he had toiled to rehabilitate before the intellect\r\nof the Fatherland, striving, by letters, to connect her more firmly\r\nwith the past, and to equip her more nobly for the future, had been\r\ncast into the cauldron. The very basis of dogma was to be changed. A\r\nnew standard was to be set up. The adoption of that standard would\r\nchange the relation of the Church to the Bible and to the Fathers, to\r\nGeneral Councils and to the Episcopate, to the people and the king, to\r\nletters and all lights, to liberties, constitutions, and every human\r\nhope. Principles which had been charged upon them by Protestants, and\r\nwhich they had resented, saying that the accusers confounded opinion\r\nwith dogma, were now lifting their heads in a General Council. He had\r\nstriven in silence to avert the evil without raising a conflict of\r\npersons or names. But now the Infallibilists felt their conscience\r\noppressed by having to recognize him, and those like-minded with him,\r\nas Catholics. They could not enjoy the fulness of their own belief as\r\nlong as the Church tolerated his creed. And the Infallibilists were the\r\nPope, the Curia, the Jesuits, and the majority of the bishops, at least\r\nof the nominal ones. If there was yet a hope, it rested in the strong\r\nhelp which God often gives to the effort of one self-risking man. The\r\nmoment was come either to run all hazards and trust to that blessing,\r\nor to float down the stream like one of those winter leaves on the Isar.\r\n\r\nIt was on January 19, just when Gratry was issuing the first of his\r\nletters, and when Darboy threw his marshal's baton into the midst\r\nof the enemy, that in the quiet house in Von der Tann Street, the\r\nformidable name of Döllinger was signed to a protest against the\r\nInfallibilist Address. Through the _Augsburg Gazette_, this presently\r\nrang all over Germany, and a little later echoed in every corner of\r\nEurope. \"One hundred and eighty millions of human beings are to be\r\ncompelled by threats of exclusion from the Church, of privation of\r\nthe sacraments, and of eternal damnation, to believe and profess\r\nwhat hitherto the Church has never believed or taught.\" So began an\r\nappeal destined to elicit proof that large numbers of educated Roman\r\nCatholics, under all their external quiet, were agitated; and that at\r\nthe same time the masses, whatever little opinions they might have,\r\nwere as to action completely under the dominion of the priests.[301]\r\n\r\nIt was now that Dupanloup wrote a letter to Deschamps, Archbishop of\r\nMalines. Two days after the opening session, Deschamps had published\r\na reply to the famous pastoral of Dupanloup. It was at once inserted\r\nin the journals of Belgium, France, and Italy. Dupanloup, who had in\r\nFrance professed to expect in Rome profound tranquillity, found himself\r\nsharply attacked. He had warily reserved the merits of the question for\r\nargument in the secret ear of the Council, treating before the public\r\nonly its accidents. But, cried Deschamps, you have pointed out the\r\ndifficulties of a definition: how could you have the courage to do so?\r\n\r\nWhen the brilliant Bishop of Orleans was ready for the press, he found\r\nthat the press was in good keeping.\r\n\r\n    Father Spada [the censor] told me that an _imprimatur_ was\r\n    necessary, and at the same time said that such an _imprimatur_\r\n    would be refused to me. Perhaps, Monsignor, you probably will think\r\n    with me that, in these circumstances, all discussion between us is\r\n    impossible; and you will feel it natural that I should preserve\r\n    the silence befitting the position in which we are placed.[302]\r\n\r\nThe French thus saw their own prelates, under their own flag, deprived\r\nof the right to defend opinions identified with their national history.\r\nThis fired Gratry, and added fresh bitters to the cup of the dying\r\nMontalembert.\r\n\r\nQuirinus says (p. 201)--\r\n\r\n    The word \"freedom\" has nowhere so ill a sound as at Rome. Only one\r\n    kind of freedom can be spoken of here--freedom of the Church; and,\r\n    in their favourite and accustomed manner of speech, by the Church\r\n    is intended the Pope; and by freedom, dominion over the State,\r\n    according to the Decretals.\r\n\r\nSome weeks later, Dupanloup did print his reply in Paris.[303] You, he\r\nsaid to Deschamps, ask how I could have the courage to point to the\r\nhistorical difficulties of a definition of infallibility; but, my dear\r\nLord, I ask you, how you can have the courage to close your eyes to\r\nthem? Repelling the idea of acclamation, and insisting on a thorough\r\nsifting of the matter, he says, and the emphases are his own--\r\n\r\n    The Church in an act so solemn, one which she never recalls, ONE\r\n    WHICH PLEDGES HER FOR EVER, ONE WHICH, UNDER PAIN OF ANATHEMA AND\r\n    OF DAMNATION ETERNAL, IS LAID UPON THE FAITH OF ALL SOULS FOR\r\n    ALL AGES, does not proceed inconsiderately, or without having\r\n    elucidated all obscurities and difficulties (p. 8).... As to the\r\n    truth of the doctrine, I reserve the discussion of that for the\r\n    Council itself, in case the question is brought on (p. 9).... You\r\n    belong not to that deplorable school of apologists who fancy that\r\n    they are defending religion when they make history lie (p. 15).\r\n\r\nHe shows how even Spalding and his associates in their proposal for\r\na method of establishing belief in infallibility different from an\r\nexpress definition, said that such a definition would\r\n\r\n    extend its effects to all past centuries, would revive all the\r\n    disputes heretofore allayed, would afford to Protestant and to\r\n    rationalistic science a new battle-field, and would open up to\r\n    the enemies, of the Church a discussion upon the whole field of\r\n    history, and the whole of the collection of Papal Bulls (p. 14).\r\n    Quoting Melchior Canus, he says: Peter has not need of your lies,\r\n    or of your adulations.... To no one, my Lord, will it be agreeable\r\n    in Rome, and amid the difficult circumstances wherein we stand, to\r\n    engage in a discussion as to the common Father, in an investigation\r\n    of the most delicate facts of history, and in a dissection of texts\r\n    of Scripture before Europe and before the world which are observing\r\n    us (p. 16).... The Fathers at Nicæa did not proceed by way of a\r\n    summary discussion, much less by way of acclamation written or oral\r\n    (p. 17).\r\n\r\nA few other expressions of Dupanloup may be recited--\r\n\r\n    Far from putting an end to the discussions in the press, it\r\n    will cause them to break out more terrible than ever.... If the\r\n    difficulties, theological and historical, of a definition are\r\n    such that simply exhibiting them as I did involves by inevitable\r\n    consequence a grave attack on infallibility itself, how could you\r\n    say that the difficulties are nothing?... You had the confident\r\n    idea that nearly all the Fathers were with you, and were going\r\n    enthusiastically to vote the definition off-hand (p. 18)....\r\n    Certainly in the Church there must be an infallible doctrinal\r\n    authority; but is it necessary that this authority should be the\r\n    Pope ALONE? Would it not suffice if it was the authority of the\r\n    Pope and the bishops united? (p. 20).... I asked why Pitt thought\r\n    it well before taking a step towards Catholic emancipation to\r\n    consult the most famous Catholic universities of Europe on the\r\n    question of the pontifical power. You have deemed it well to\r\n    answer not a word (p. 23).... In the ninth century we lost about\r\n    one-half of the Church; in the sixteenth at least a third of the\r\n    other half. At the present moment perhaps a half of what remains is\r\n    more or less broken in upon (_entamée_). We have to reconquer....\r\n    Would you all at once, as several bishops from America said to\r\n    me yesterday, change for the whole of the Catholic clergy who\r\n    live in the midst of Protestant populations the entire ground of\r\n    religious controversy? (p. 24).... In France, the Parliament, the\r\n    Senate, the Legislative Corps, the Councils of State, the public\r\n    officers, the bench, the bar, the young collegians, the army, the\r\n    navy, commerce, finance, the arts, the liberal professions, the\r\n    workmen of the cities, the electors in the country districts, the\r\n    great mass of those who with us and elsewhere determine the course\r\n    of affairs,--in a word, the nation, assuredly is not with you (p.\r\n    25).... Have you not heard the cry of the bishops of Germany,\r\n    Hungary, Bohemia, and of so many others? (p. 25).... Three\r\n    centuries ago a wave passed over Germany, a wave over England,\r\n    Holland, Switzerland; and at this hour the wave has not subsided,\r\n    but is still encroaching on the shore (p. 26).... Brazil is sick,\r\n    Mexico is sick, the old Spanish colonies proceed from revolution\r\n    to revolution, and it is my mournful conviction that what you, my\r\n    Lord, are preparing, will give to the Church in all those countries\r\n    a new and terrible shaking (p. 26).... Some say the great evil of\r\n    our day is that the principle of authority is laid low. Let us\r\n    exalt it in the Church, and we shall save society.... To think that\r\n    by proclaiming the infallibility of the Pope you will roll back the\r\n    revolution is, to my view, one of those illusions which sometimes,\r\n    in human societies, desperate parties make for themselves on the\r\n    eve of a supreme crisis (p. 27).\r\n\r\nHis statement of the condition of things before he first wrote would\r\nappear to be meant to depict what existed in Rome as he was now\r\nwriting--\r\n\r\n    No, it was not unanimity as to the question debated among us which\r\n    reigned ere I spoke. It was on the one side violence, and on the\r\n    other side astonishment, silent and downcast. If any voice was\r\n    raised, speedily was it covered with clamours and insults (p. 31).\r\n\r\nThis reply called down from Veuillot many pages of taunts, gibes, and\r\nsneers.\r\n\r\nMeans of humiliating the bishops of the Opposition were found by the\r\nsovereign, which seem new in both kingly and parliamentary warfare.\r\nPriests wrote against them, and the Pope sent to those priests\r\nfor publication letters of approval, containing sharp cuts at the\r\nunfortunate prelates. To the Jesuit Ramière, the Pope said that he had\r\nset Maret \"in contradiction with himself, so that you have constrained\r\nhim to demolish the edifice with his own hands\" (_Friedberg_, p. 490).\r\nThe Vicar-General of Nimes had written against Dupanloup, and forth\r\ncomes an epistle of Pius IX praising him for his elegant refutation of\r\nthe empty sophisms which had caused a disturbance of minds deplored by\r\nall (_Friedberg_, p. 488).\r\n\r\nContinental Catholic writers generally put Dr. Pusey as one of the\r\nmost important promoters of the Church of Rome. Yet they were aware\r\nthat he did not belong to it. In his second pamphlet Dupanloup spoke\r\nwith feeling of the value of the Ritualistic party, both in England\r\nand America, as pointing to Rome. _Ce Qui se Passe au Concile_ says\r\n(p. iii., troisième éd.),--\"In England Dr. Pusey, the originator of\r\nthe Ritualistic movement, which has led so many persons, eminent for\r\nintellect to the Catholic religion--Pusey, whose loyal sincerity no one\r\never suspected,\" had written that nothing would be more fatal to the\r\nprospect of reunion than a declaration of Papal infallibility. This\r\nwas not likely to make much impression upon the Curia. They knew that\r\nwhat for England was called reunion, for Rome was called submission;\r\nwhich Manning told them would be facilitated by definition; and Manning\r\nserved them so punctiliously that they were fain to believe him.\r\nMoreover, what Desanctis in that remarkable book _Roma Papale_, had\r\nmany years previously described as the plan of the Curia for operations\r\nin England, would be little affected by a doctrine or two more or\r\nless. His account, in one word, was that they would mission England\r\nthrough the senses, leaving doctrines and arguments in the background.\r\nIt was a question of spectacle, not of reason or Scripture. And love\r\nof spectacle was adorned with the name of aesthetics, and sensible\r\nEnglishmen were to be led captive by the power of clothes. In this\r\npoint of view, one who promoted the use of the chosen means might\r\nbetter serve the end from the very fact that he did not himself aim so\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 293: We should be curious to know if the writer would now\r\ncomment on these terms so doubtfully. Further study would probably\r\nhave given greater decision. The meaning of the obedience of princes\r\nand nations was as distinct as possible from that of the obedience\r\nof private persons, whether Catholics or heretics.

The secret labour of five years was ruthlessly exposed by two\r\nunconsecrated offenders. How the \"breach of the pontifical secret\" had\r\noccurred, of which Cardinal Antonelli complained in despatch after\r\ndespatch, may perhaps be known some other day. What we now know is that\r\npublicity took possession of the results, though secrecy had presided\r\nover all the processes. Even the bond of mortal sin had proved too weak\r\nfor what Curran might have called the irresistible genius of universal\r\nillumination. The decrees, canons, and anathemas proposed on the\r\nsubject of Church and State were now before the world.\r\n\r\nOn January 21, the Schema, or Draft of Decrees on the Church, was\r\ndistributed to the bishops. Hefele told how a diplomatist laughingly\r\nboasted that he had received one at the same time.[304] This Draft was\r\nto that on faith what the application is to the sermon. It laid down\r\nprinciples in fifteen chapters, and reduced them to operative shape in\r\ntwenty-one canons. Vitelleschi says (p. 85)--\r\n\r\n    Now, on summing up these Canons, what do they amount to? Sole\r\n    religion, the Catholic; sole head, the Pope, \"who has full and\r\n    supreme power\"; his laws superior to those of the State, on which\r\n    he exercises his judgment \"concerning the lawful and the unlawful,\"\r\n    and disposes of permissions and punishments. Dante has imagined an\r\n    Emperor and a Pope, who between them shall direct the world; but\r\n    if the idea of these Canons were fully carried out with regard to\r\n    civil society, there would remain the Pope only.\r\n\r\nThis object, the Pope only, which rests in the logical view of\r\nVitelleschi, as the result of his examination of the Canons, is the\r\nsame object which long previously stood before the illuminated vision\r\nof M. Veuillot, whose means of reaching conclusions were not so\r\ncircuitous. The Pope only is the object which Archbishop Cecconi even\r\nnow sets out as the paramount figure of the future, albeit with no\r\nextatic confidence. And the Pope only is precisely that crowning beauty\r\nin the image of the world-empire which Cardinal Manning reproached\r\nMr. Bryce with missing in his conception of the Catholic universe.\r\nMr. Bryce, like Dante, was a dualist. Dualism, however, was to be\r\ndone away with, except in the wholesome form of light and darkness,\r\nthe two opposed forces. All the labour and the silence of the recent\r\nyears had been employed in preparing an inauguration which vulgar eye\r\nwas not to disturb till the King should burst forth in his plenitude\r\nof supreme authority with unerring judgment, so arrayed that all the\r\ntribes of Israel would hail the mystic David the one King-shepherd and\r\nShepherd-king of a world at last unified.\r\n\r\nThe description of the effect of these canons given by Quirinus (p.\r\n203) was not so elegant as that of Vitelleschi. He wrote for Germans\r\nmenaced with a change; while the Romans to whom the Marchese spoke,\r\nhad for ages been themselves delivered from dualism, and could see\r\nin the new measures only an effort to extend to all the human race\r\nthat perfect Catholic unity, religious and political, of which their\r\nStates had been the sole blameless example. They well knew who was the\r\n_spiritual David_, the one shepherd of the one fold,--shepherd with\r\nsling as well as pipe, shepherd with sword as well as crook,--on whose\r\nfuture reign over one kingdom the eye of the Jesuit, gazing through the\r\nglass of Ezekiel, dwelt with rapture, expounding: \"I will make them one\r\nnation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall\r\nbe king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither\r\nshall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.... And\r\nDavid my servant shall be king over them, and they all shall have one\r\nshepherd.\"[305]\r\n\r\nQuirinus, writing as one to whom this unity had been perhaps gorgeous\r\nin the distance, but who saw it now in a new aspect, cried: \"These\r\ntransparent Decrees and anathemas may be thus summed up: the Christian\r\nworld consists simply of masters and slaves. The masters are the\r\nItalians, the Pope, and his Court; and the slaves are all bishops\r\n(including the Italians themselves), all priests, and all the laity.\"\r\nWhether Quirinus had studied Tarquini's _à priori_ system of the\r\nPerfect Society, we do not know; but any one referring to our analysis\r\nof it will see how closely it corresponds with the following, in which\r\nQuirinus sums up the doctrine of these Draft Decrees--\r\n\r\n    Three main ideas run through the Schema, and are formulated\r\n    into dogmatic Decrees guarded with anathemas. _Firstly_, to the\r\n    Pope belongs absolute dominion over the whole Church, whether\r\n    dispersed or assembled in Council. _Secondly_, the Pope's temporal\r\n    sovereignty over a portion of the Peninsula must be maintained as\r\n    pertaining to dogma. _Thirdly_, Church and State are immutably\r\n    connected; but in the sense that the Church's laws always hold\r\n    good before and against the civil law, and therefore every Papal\r\n    ordinance that is opposed to the constitution and law of the land,\r\n    binds the faithful, under pain of mortal sin, to disobey the\r\n    constitution and law of their country (p. 204).\r\n\r\nOne incidental notice of the Draft by Quirinus is, \"regulating all\r\nrelations between Church and State, and restoring the Papal supremacy\r\nover the bodies and souls of men\" (p. 209).\r\n\r\nThe _Rheinischer Merkur_ (p. 22) quotes the Ultramontane _Hausblätter_\r\nas asserting that the twenty-one Canons had all been long recognised as\r\npart of the Catholic faith. No, says the _Merkur_, some of them were\r\nrepudiated as calumnious by the Catholic bishops of England and Ireland\r\nin 1826. On the same page it says:\r\n\r\n    We do not want a centralized power of a theocratic complexion,\r\n    claiming the right of interfering at will, and disturbing\r\n    our political and social relations, and of reducing princes\r\n    to vassals--a centralized power claiming that its Decrees\r\n    shall bind the conscience as divine.... We do not want this\r\n    apparatus of coercion for the Church--_contumaces salubribus\r\n    poenis coercendi_--for compelling the contumacious by wholesome\r\n    penalties;--we know what that means!... We do not want\r\n    under-satraps armed with whips; we do not want despotism, which, as\r\n    well as heresy, is one of the gates of hell. Ready to render to God\r\n    what is God's, we also wish to render to Cæsar what is Cæsar's, and\r\n    we count it a precious birthright to be reckoned as good subjects\r\n    by our lawful sovereigns; but just on this account do we regard\r\n    Drafts of Decrees, the execution of which would cause us to appear\r\n    as enemies of public safety and of dynastic order, in the light\r\n    of attacks on our civil existence, and as calculated to bring us\r\n    into the same position as that in which our fellow Catholics in the\r\n    Russian Empire groan.\r\n\r\nWhat would these Liberal Catholics have said had Reisach's Drafts\r\nnot been \"shipwrecked\"? The twenty-one Canons place the affairs of\r\nthis world so much at the discretion of the Pontiff, that proposals\r\nwhich alarmed the same men who brought these forward, must have been\r\nstartling. In principle, they could hardly have claimed more than is\r\nclaimed here; but possibly they contained formulæ for the application\r\nof principle, which might have attracted the attention even of those\r\npoliticians who think it wise and practical to ignore principles. In\r\nnothing is Rome stronger than in her consciousness that when once\r\nshe has succeeded in getting a principle recognized, she can afford\r\nto temporize as to its application, and for a while to temporize as\r\nto its application, and for a while to compromise as to details. As\r\nthe preparations of Reisach had been kept back, and the Canons which\r\ncarried the principles were presented, so we shall find that the Canons\r\nwere eventually sacrificed, as too much entering into detail, in order\r\nto carry what embraced all.\r\n\r\nThe Decrees in question were clearly intended as a vehicle to carry\r\nover the doctrines of the Syllabus respecting Church and State from the\r\ndomain of ideas into that of facts. The _Chapters_ would furnish text\r\nfor professors and preachers. The _Canons_ would bind the conscience of\r\nevery Catholic, on pain of anathema. Nothing further could be wanting\r\nthan executive contrivances, such as probably the Drafts of Reisach\r\nwere intended to provide.\r\n\r\nThe following is an abridged view of the _substance and effect_ of the\r\ntwenty-one Canons (_Documenta_, ii. p. 101):--\r\n\r\n    1. If any man say that the religion of Christ is not made manifest\r\n    in a society, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n    2. If any man say that the Church has no certain and immutable\r\n    form, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n    3. If any man say that she is not external and visible, let him be\r\n    anathema.\r\n\r\n    4. If any man say that she is not one body, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n    5. If any man say that she is not a society necessary to the\r\n    obtaining of eternal salvation, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n    6. If any man say that her intolerance in the condemnation of all\r\n    sects is not divinely commanded, or that such sects ought to be\r\n    tolerated, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n    7. If any man say that she may err in doctrine, depart from her\r\n    original institution, or cease to exist, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n    8. If any man say that she is not a final dispensation, let him be\r\n    anathema.\r\n\r\n    9. If any man say that her infallibility extends only to things\r\n    contained in revelation, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n    10. If any man say that she is not a Perfect Society, but an\r\n    association (_collegium_) which may be subjected to secular rule,\r\n    let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n    11. If any man say that bishops have not by divine appointment a\r\n    proper power of ruling, which they are freely to exercise, let him\r\n    be anathema.\r\n\r\n    12. If any man say that the power of the Church lies only in\r\n    counsel or persuasion, but not in legal commands, in coercion and\r\n    compulsion by external jurisdiction, and in wholesome pains, let\r\n    him be anathema.\r\n\r\n    13. If any man say that the true Church, out of which none can be\r\n    saved, is any other than the Roman, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n    14. If any man say that Peter was not prince of the apostles and\r\n    head of the whole Church, or that he received only a primacy of\r\n    honour and not of jurisdiction, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n    15. If any man say that he had not successors, or that the Roman\r\n    Pontiff was not his successor in the primacy, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n    16. If any man say that the Roman Pontiff has only a right of\r\n    supervision or direction over the Universal Church, and not a full\r\n    and supreme power of jurisdiction, or that his power over the\r\n    Churches, taken separately, is not immediate and ordinary, let him\r\n    be anathema.\r\n\r\n    17. If any man say that the power of the Church is not compatible\r\n    with that of supreme civil power, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n    18. If any man say that the power necessary to rule civil society\r\n    is not from God, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n    19. If any man say that all rights among men and all authority are\r\n    derived from the State, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n    20. If any man say that the supreme rule of conscience lies in the\r\n    law of the State, or in public opinion, and that the judicial power\r\n    of the Church does not extend to pronouncing them legitimate or\r\n    illegitimate, or that by civil law that can become legitimate which\r\n    by divine law is illegitimate, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n    21. If any man say that the laws of the Church have not binding\r\n    force unless confirmed by the civil power, and that it is competent\r\n    to the civil power to judge or decree in causes where religion is\r\n    implicated, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\nThe logical succession of ideas was manifest. The first five Canons\r\nestablished the principle that the Christian Church is a society\r\nwhich has Form, Visibility, Unity, and is necessary to salvation. The\r\nnext series pronounced this Church to be Intolerant (6), Infallible\r\n(7), Final as a dispensation (8), Infallible in matters not contained\r\nin revelation (9), a Perfect Society not subject to the civil power\r\n(10), ruling by bishops (11) and possessing legislative, judicial, and\r\ncompulsory power (12), because none can be saved out of her (13). The\r\nfourteenth Canon, and the two following ones, establish the unlimited\r\ndominion of the Pope over all bishops; while the eleventh establishes\r\nthe ruling power of bishops, but leaves the sphere of it undefined, not\r\neven saying that it is over the Church. And this undefined ruling power\r\nof bishops is placed between the independence of the Church in relation\r\nto the civil power on the one hand, and her own compulsory power and\r\nthe absolute authority of the Pope over the bishops on the other.\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth Canon affirms that the power of the Church is\r\ncompatible with civil authority,--which without a doubt it is, so\r\nlong as the civil authority abides within the limits traced for it by\r\nthe Church. That authority may also, in the sense of Rome, be, in its\r\norder, supreme,--that is, not subject to any other civil authority,\r\nbut always subject to the Pope, who is an authority of a higher order\r\nthan the civil. The eighteenth Canon bases all civil authority on\r\ndivine right. This is capable of more than one interpretation. First,\r\nit may mean that all existing authority is to be viewed as from God,\r\nwhether it originated in conquest, prescription, or vote; or, secondly,\r\nit may mean that no civil authority is legitimate which has not divine\r\nsanction; and as among the baptized that sanction cannot be received\r\nexcept through the Pope, the consequence of such an interpretation\r\nwould be obvious. The nineteenth Canon deliberately confounds natural\r\nand legal rights, as if the laws that create and protect legal rights\r\nwere not themselves the outgrowth of natural rights. In the same way it\r\nconfounds natural authority and legal authority. The twentieth seems\r\nto put civil law and mere public opinion on the same level, and places\r\nboth one and the other under the judgment of the Church, and that as\r\nto their legitimacy or illegitimacy. _Judgment_, of course, does not\r\nmean criticism, instruction, remonstrance, or warning. It means what\r\nthe word would mean anywhere, in such solemn legislative language,\r\nnamely, judicial sentence. _Legitimacy_ or _illegitimacy_, again, does\r\nnot mean wisdom or folly, goodness or badness, but means what it says.\r\nDivine law includes Church law, and what it forbids no civil law can\r\nwarrant. Therefore the power claimed in this fundamental proposition\r\nis that with which we are already acquainted in the literature of the\r\nmovement for reconstruction, that, namely, of declaring what laws of\r\na particular State are or are not legitimate; every such State being\r\nconsidered as a province of the universal theocratic monarchy.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no principle embodied in these Canons lies so deep under the\r\nwhole movement against free government in religious and civil society\r\nas the principle that confounds civil rights with natural ones, and,\r\nby denying that the State is the source of all rights, covers the\r\ndenial of the fact that it is the source of legal rights. As to legal\r\nrights, we, sitting free and thankful amid our books, our friends, and\r\nour blessings, no more know of any source of such rights except that\r\nbenign ordinance of our Father in heaven, the civil law, than did the\r\nteacher of Plato, when by law deprived of his natural rights, he sat in\r\nhis cell while the deadly cup was being prepared.[306] No, the State is\r\nnot the author of rights, but it is the guardian of them. Practically\r\nall our natural rights are but a common for any beast to trample and\r\nto browse upon till the State surrounds them with the sacred fence of\r\nlaw; then do they turn into garden sward, and well-watched flowers and\r\nfruits exceeding fair. But these principles, which strip the State of\r\nall moral mission, which empty law of all moral character, which rob\r\nsociety itself, and all the institutions of society, of any aim moral\r\nand eternal, of any but a temporary, material end, and which transfer\r\nall that is noble to the priesthood alone, cover one of the darkest\r\nattempts that art could direct against all the foundations of public\r\nlife. The moral mission of the State is written on every page of the\r\nBible, and the political mission of Christian priests not on a single\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe State in renouncing for itself the right to dictate to men their\r\nfaith and worship, does not empty itself of a moral character, but,\r\non the contrary, takes the highest possible moral ground. In that\r\nrenunciation it does not disavow the faith and fear of God, but, on\r\nthe contrary, avows its persuasion that the rights which affect the\r\nconscience of His creatures are so sacred as not to be sufficiently\r\nguarded except in His hand alone. Of shallow pretexts for oppression,\r\nnone was ever shallower than the assumption that because society as\r\nsuch says that it dares not to come between God and the soul, therefore\r\ndoes it say that as society it has nothing to do with God.\r\n\r\nThe Court was evidently not disposed to leave politicians under\r\nany delusion. The _Civiltá_ wrote on the politicasters and the\r\nCouncil,[307] as if to make statesmen feel that they had either to\r\nsubmit or else to bear the brunt of the revolutionary forces, from\r\nbelow and from above. A principal object of the Council, says the\r\narticle, had avowedly been \"the restoration of peace in the orders,\r\neven the political ones, of Christendom.\" Confessing that statesmen,\r\nor _politicasters_, as it called them, evinced anxiety, the _Civiltá_\r\nnamed measures to which they might be tempted to resort. These were\r\nthreefold--first, making new preventive laws; secondly, restoring\r\nobsolete ones; thirdly, separating the Church and the State. By\r\npreventive laws must be understood any legal bar set up to impede the\r\nPope in any exercise of his legislative, judicial, or coercive power in\r\na given realm. Preventive laws, old or new, it pronounces to be weapons\r\nwhich would infallibly \"burst or break in the hands of governments, if\r\nthey attempted to use them.\"\r\n\r\nThe method by which this result would be brought about is indicated in\r\na way which shows how _divine_ law can loose what civil law binds.\r\n\r\n    There are two cases in which a subordinate is not obliged to obey\r\n    a superior; the first, when a contrary precept exists of greater\r\n    authority; the second, when the superior gives commands in things\r\n    in respect of which the subordinate is not placed under him....\r\n    An inferior authority is not to be disobeyed when a superior one\r\n    prohibits. Now, the authority of the Church, assembled in Council,\r\n    is superior to the authority of the State.... It is superior in\r\n    the sense in which the reasoning faculty in man is superior to the\r\n    sentient and vegetative faculties.... Since the ecclesiastical\r\n    authority is superior to the civil in such wise that, in matters\r\n    affecting both, the acts of the civil must be subject to those\r\n    of the ecclesiastical, it is manifest that if a collision arose\r\n    between the definitions of the OEcumenical Council and the laws of\r\n    the State, the latter would cease, by that fact alone, to have any\r\n    binding force whatever.\r\n\r\n    The same conclusion may be deduced from the words in which the\r\n    divine Founder of the Church gave authority to His disciples to\r\n    teach His doctrine to all nations. _All power is given to Me in\r\n    heaven and in earth. Go and teach all nations._ From the fact\r\n    that, in virtue of His divine generation, the Father had conferred\r\n    on Him all power, celestial and terrestrial, Christ argued thus,\r\n    Therefore, go ye and teach all nations my doctrine; and thus He\r\n    clearly demonstrated that His Church was invested by Him with _such\r\n    a right of teaching that it would never be lawful for any power\r\n    to offer to her opposition_. Therefore, should the State require\r\n    obedience to laws contrary to the definitions of the Council, it\r\n    would do so without a true legal right. And if, notwithstanding, it\r\n    employed force to procure obedience, it would fall into tyranny,\r\n    odious to the conscience and ruinous to itself.... By no means\r\n    does the authority of governments extend to commanding what the\r\n    OEcumenical Council may prohibit, or to prohibiting what it may\r\n    command; and if governments should arrogate to themselves the right\r\n    of doing so, in vain would they presume upon being able to oblige\r\n    Catholics subject to submit; and should they have recourse to\r\n    force, they would plunge themselves into tyranny which would not\r\n    long serve the interests of those who displayed it.\r\n\r\nThe principles are very simple and firmly fixed. While submission to\r\n_legitimate_ authority is a duty, resistance to \"tyranny\" is a right.\r\nAny authority used in contravention of the decrees of the Church\r\nceases to be legitimate, runs into tyranny, and is to be disobeyed.\r\nHence the duty of obedience to civil rulers is taught in the term\r\n\"_due_ obedience,\" and only the Pope can judge when obedience ceases\r\nto be due; but it is judged already that due it never can be, in any\r\npossible case, wherein the civil law contravenes the directions of\r\nthe ecclesiastical authority. How States which profess to accept the\r\ncorporation which insists on these principles as a true and worthy\r\nteacher, or which look on it as anything but an erring and dangerous\r\ncaste, are to escape dissolution, it is not easy to see.\r\n\r\nIt is not hard to call the hopes of victory in the impending struggle\r\nmonkish dreams, nor easy to dispel the show of probability in the\r\nfollowing argument. Hundreds of examples in the past, where persistent\r\necclesiastical agitation triumphed over political instability,\r\nwould rise up to the memory of well read Jesuits, as making their\r\ncalculations seem like those of positive philosophers, and the hopes of\r\njournalists and members of Parliament like those of enthusiasts, in the\r\nsense of men who look for ends without using means.\r\n\r\n    \"What would such laws come to in case they were enacted? They\r\n    would come to be laws of no validity and no effect in what touches\r\n    belief: of no validity because essentially null as to binding\r\n    force; of no effect because unable to prevent Catholics from a\r\n    full adhesion of mind and heart to the dogmatic definitions of the\r\n    Church. And as to external acts and matters of discipline, such\r\n    laws would become a dead letter, or a criminal oppression. A dead\r\n    letter if the governments did not feel that they had nerve to put\r\n    forth the strong hand and enforce the execution of them, in which\r\n    case the laws would become a _ridiculous comedy_. Or a criminal\r\n    oppression if, feeling themselves possessed of force, they should\r\n    employ it to execute laws tyrannical, as being opposed to public\r\n    liberty, public religion, and public faith.\"\r\n\r\nAs to separating the Church from the State, the _Civiltá_ proudly\r\nquotes the _Monde_ of Paris:--\r\n\r\n    The Catholics have number and force on their side ... before\r\n    apostatising the French government would think twice ... the\r\n    government surely would not give the signal for its own fall, and\r\n    for a long revolution.\r\n\r\nThe separation of Church and State is here spoken of evidently in the\r\nordinary sense; but the charge of having already separated the State\r\nfrom the Church was one frequently brought against the government\r\nof France, when the language employed was that of the initiated. In\r\nthat language the Draft of Decrees now under consideration described\r\nseparation of the State from the Church as the denial of the right or\r\nduty of the State to coerce by the appointed penalties, except so far\r\nas may be demanded in the interests of public peace, those who violate\r\nthe Catholic religion.[308]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 304: _Unitá Cattolica_, March 4, quoting _Volksblatt_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 305: See exposition of Ezek. xxxvii. 21-24, _Civiltá_, VII.\r\nvi. 293.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 306: Compare the _Crito_ and the _Phædo_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 307: Serie VII. ix. 257 ff.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 308: Cap. xii. _Doc. ad.

The two Emperors\r\nwho, with the Pope, held a share in the sovereignty of Austria and\r\nFrance respectively, began to be aware of the fact that they might find\r\nthemselves left by their senior partner exactly in the legal position\r\nwhich we have seen Phillips describe as that of the State in relation\r\nto the Church--the position in law of a married woman as compared with\r\nher husband. It will be remembered that, according to the doctrine\r\nof the _Civiltá_, every Catholic State must have two kings. It will\r\nfurther be remembered that all the Pope's subjects are bound to observe\r\nhis law before that of the nation. If, therefore, the universal ruler\r\ncould promulge what laws he pleased, and all these laws were to take\r\nthe foreway of any competing laws of the State, it was plain that of\r\nthe two kings in each State, the local one was at the mercy of the\r\nuniversal one.\r\n\r\nOn January 18, the very day on which Gratry dated his famous letter,\r\nand on which, probably, Döllinger penned his protest dated one day\r\nlater, Count Daru wrote a letter, of which the press got hold: \"They\r\ncannot be so blind,\" said the Foreign Minister of France, \"as to\r\nsuppose that it would be possible for us to keep our troops there a\r\nday after infallibility was proclaimed.\" He hoped that the Holy Father\r\nwould yield to the counsel of the most illustrious of the French\r\nbishops. A fortnight later (Feb. 5), in a second letter, he expressed\r\nfears that the majority would take advantage of its powers, and said\r\nthat he had caused Cardinal Antonelli to be apprised of the truth\r\nthrough M. de Banneville; but he adds: \"It is clear that everything may\r\nbe thrown into uncertainty by the conduct of the Italian, Spanish, and\r\nmissionary bishops, who seem to live in a world apart.\" He again speaks\r\nof the impossibility of keeping up a French garrison, and declares\r\nthat the Propaganda seems to take no account of the Concordat, and\r\nthat perhaps violence may be done to the pact which unites France with\r\nRome. The revolutionary party, he affirms, is not only conspiring, but\r\nactually moving, and Rome must be blind to put weapons in their hands\r\nby breaking the force of the Conservatives, and compelling rebellion by\r\nthe Syllabus.\r\n\r\nThis language betrays the weakness of statesmen who rely on Rome, as\r\nif it was a Conservative agency, but it would cause little anxiety\r\nto the Curia. They had forty thousand drilled men in France holding\r\nimportant places under the State. At this very time the movements of\r\nthe revolutionary party in Paris were dwelt upon by Don Margotti in the\r\ntone of an enthusiastic bone-setter, who, hearing of accidents, felt\r\nsure that he must be called in. On February 11 the _Unitá Cattolica_\r\nsaid that--\r\n\r\n    \"Bonaparte had cause to fear barricades in Paris. He and his\r\n    minister had been setting up barricades against the Council, and\r\n    so the revolutionists were setting up barricades against him.\r\n    The Church always conquered the barricades of Gallicanism, but\r\n    Bonaparte may not conquer those of Paris. Some morning we may find\r\n    that he has fled. The Emperor would have set his house in order in\r\n    a better manner, if, instead of launching into the parliamentary\r\n    system, he had declared from the day the Council was announced that\r\n    he would submit himself and France in everything and for everything\r\n    to its decision....\"\r\n\r\nThe very next day it is added--\r\n\r\n    \"The troubles in Paris are a vengeance of divine justice on\r\n    Napoleon for his misconduct in Italy. Had he not prevented the Pope\r\n    from sending his cousin, Count Pepoli of Bologna, to the galleys,\r\n    he would not have had to imprison Rochefort.\"\r\n\r\nIf the same men who thus detested Napoleon threatened the Italians\r\nwith French arms, it was simply from the belief that the Papacy had a\r\nstronger hold upon France than the empire. After saying (February 8)\r\nthat modern society is to the Church what the world was to Christ, and\r\nthat the first Syllabus against the world was compiled by Christ, Don\r\nMargotti says on the next day to the Italians--\r\n\r\n    You will not go to Rome, because France will always oppose you;\r\n    and she does so because, if she did not, the world would. If\r\n    the free-thinkers do not believe in miracles, let them see one\r\n    in this--that Rome will never be taken from the Pope. Even a\r\n    government with Rochefort at its head would defend the temporal\r\n    dominion of the Pope-king.\r\n\r\nThere is a solemn passage in Vitelleschi where he speaks of the\r\nfrequency with which governments find that they have to face some\r\nrevolutionary movement at one and at the same time as that in which the\r\nclaims of the Church are being pressed upon them. He does not pronounce\r\nthat the two facts are in individual cases connected, but he does say\r\nthat the frequent recurrence of the two simultaneously is \"an organic\r\nphenomenon worthy of the deepest attention\" (p. 235). Rechtbaur in\r\nVienna said, \"They threaten revolution if the State does not renounce\r\nits rights\"; and a couple of days after it had quoted this remark, the\r\n_Unitá Cattolica_ said--\r\n\r\n    Diocletian left a long tail behind him. His tail consists of those\r\n    politicians who protest against the Syllabus as a declaration of\r\n    war against modern society. Beust in Vienna, Hohenlohe in Munich,\r\n    Ollivier in Paris, were not tranquil like the priest in Rome.\r\n    Sooner or later they would all be engulfed in the stormy sea of\r\n    revolution--all but the Church and the Pope. The Syllabus would\r\n    abide for ever, and with it the Canons of the Vatican Council....\r\n    The Pope has proved by facts that he knows how to govern better\r\n    than any other sovereign. We defy any emperor whatever to govern a\r\n    country fourteen years as Pope Pius IX has governed Rome.\r\n\r\nThe letters of Count Daru, quoted above, caused inquiry in Rome.\r\nQuirinus asserted that the only existing copy of them was in the hands\r\nof the English government. It was known that Lord Acton was a near\r\nrelation of the English Minister for Foreign Affairs. Putting this\r\nand that together, the Curia was inclined to say that Quirinus must\r\nbe Lord Acton; and it is confidently affirmed that Monsignor Randi,\r\nwhose spiritual duties were those of Director of Police, was taken\r\ninto consultation with the Pope as to whether it would or would not be\r\nexpedient to banish the suspected English nobleman.[309] The _Unitá_\r\ntried to make capital against Dupanloup out of these letters. It could\r\nnot believe that the Bishop of Orleans would write to Daru and tell him\r\nwhat passed in the Council (March 8).\r\n\r\nThe anxiety felt at Courts in Catholic nations had now penetrated the\r\nmind of Count Beust. On February 10 he penned a remarkable despatch,\r\nin which he recited his pacific intentions and his innocent hopes, as\r\nindicated in his treatment of the Council hitherto, and especially\r\nin his rejection of the overtures of Bavaria. He was now, however,\r\nobliged to confess that, in Rome, there was a manifest determination\r\nnot to acknowledge, nay, more, not to tolerate, that liberty which\r\nAustria claimed for the State in civil legislation. He now confesses\r\nto \"alarm,\" and affirms that the Decrees of the Church \"would dig an\r\nimpassable gulf between the laws of the Church and those which govern\r\nthe greater part of modern societies.\" He plainly declares that Austria\r\nwould reserve to herself the right of interdicting the publication of\r\nany Act infringing the majesty of the law, and that every person who\r\nshould disregard such prohibition must bear the legal consequences.\r\nThis despatch was followed by one to Berlin,[310] pointing out how\r\ndelicate had been the position of Austria in the present transaction.\r\nThe empire was passing through an internal transformation. Hence\r\narose a special necessity of maintaining the supremacy of law, and a\r\ncorresponding expediency of avoiding internal conflict. In addition\r\nto reasons of State for not identifying his policy with that of the\r\nminority of the bishops of the Council, Count Beust alleged that\r\nthose prelates found that any interference on the part of governments\r\nturned to an embarrassment for themselves, because they were accused\r\nof being the instruments of the political rulers, and he felt that it\r\nwas not the bishops but the Cabinets that must defend the rights of\r\nStates. A third despatch was directed to Munich.[311] In this, Count\r\nBeust intimated that Prince Hohenlohe might naturally think that it\r\nwould have been better had the Count in time seen the force of his\r\nrecommendations. Parrying this objection, he strongly urged united\r\naction, and stated that Austria was now ready to co-operate in a matter\r\nthat evidently affected the common interests of all governments. The\r\neffect of all this was a formal visit of Count Trauttmansdorff, the\r\nAustrian ambassador, to Cardinal Antonelli. According to the report\r\nof the Count, the Cardinal had really nothing to say beyond the most\r\ncommonplace evasions. The Decrees were still subject to discussion,\r\nand, on the other hand, interdicting the publication of Decrees in a\r\ncertain country did not deprive them of their validity. Besides, he\r\ncould not see how prohibiting the publication of the laws of the Church\r\ncould be consistent with the policy which consisted in giving liberty\r\nto the publication of anything. Moreover, all the world knew that,\r\nwhile Rome affirmed principles, she would be very reasonable and gentle\r\nin the application of them, and none need to take the least alarm.\r\nCount Trauttmansdorff expresses his satisfaction with the attitude of\r\nthe German bishops, but thinks that Austria has lost her influence by\r\nher recent changes of policy, and especially by her attacks upon the\r\nConcordat. He expects, on the contrary, great effect from the exercise\r\nof French influence.\r\n\r\nThe reply of Count Beust to this despatch was prompt and clear. True,\r\nhe said, Decrees of the Church retain their validity though rejected\r\nby the government; but this was the very circumstance that showed the\r\ngravity of the position. It would become a serious matter, both for the\r\nChurch and for Catholic governments, if laws which were valid for the\r\none, were repudiated by the other. Again, as to the Cardinal's remark\r\nthat refusing the Church liberty to promulge her laws was scarcely\r\nconsistent with professions of giving liberty to publish anything,\r\nCount Beust thought that this remark could hardly be serious. \"Respect\r\nfor the law is the basis of all liberty,\" said the Count, \"and liberty\r\nwhich passes that boundary, becomes licence.\" But this arrow would fall\r\nblunted from a conscience covered by the buckler of the Vatican. Any\r\nVaticanist would simply say, Respect for a higher law is not disregard\r\nof law; and whenever Rome has spoken, her word is the higher law,\r\nrespect for which is the real basis of order.\r\n\r\nThe reply of Antonelli to the despatch of Beust is a singular document.\r\nHe is so generally credited with ability as a diplomatist that one\r\nwould fear to say, even if one thought, that it is anything but an\r\nable paper, whether viewed in an intellectual or a diplomatic aspect.\r\nHe states that the remonstrances of Beust were expressed in \"not\r\nvery delicate terms,\" and in weaker and much less courteous forms\r\nputs forward the arguments which we shall presently find employed\r\nin his reply to Daru. So far from accepting the reproach of want of\r\ndelicacy, Beust instantly and formally repelled it, and said that\r\nthe Pope's Nuncio, when appealed to, could hardly find an expression\r\nin his despatch on which to attempt to sustain the allegation of the\r\nCardinal. He demanded a copy of the despatch, and, as soon as he had\r\nobtained it, instructed the ambassador at Rome to thank Antonelli for\r\ngranting it, and to tell him that he had immediately laid it before the\r\nEmperor.[312] Whether the Emperor thought the despatch respectful to a\r\npower such as his we cannot say.\r\n\r\nThe day after that on which Count Trauttmansdorff reported his\r\ninterview with Cardinal Antonelli, Count Daru, in Paris, despatched\r\nan important document to the Vatican. According to an analysis of it,\r\ncontained in the reply of Antonelli,[313] the Count summed up the\r\neffect of the Canons in two propositions. First, the infallibility\r\nof the Church extends, not only to the deposit of faith, but also\r\nto all that is necessary to its preservation. Secondly, the Church\r\nis a divine and perfect society, and exercises its powers in two\r\ntribunals, the interior and the exterior. She is absolute in the\r\ndomain of legislation, judicial procedure, and coercive force; and\r\nmoreover exercises her power with full liberty, and in independence\r\nof any civil power whatever. The Count points out that the claims of\r\nthe Church are now extended to authority over history, philosophy,\r\nand science, and involve an absolute subordination to the authority\r\nof the Church of the very principles of a national constitution, the\r\nrights and duties of governments, with the political rights and duties\r\nof citizens, both electoral and municipal. They are extended even to\r\neverything included in judicature and in legislation, in respect both\r\nof persons and things; to the rules of public administration, to the\r\nrights and duties of corporations, and in general to all the rights of\r\nthe State, not excepting the right of conquest, and that of peace and\r\nwar. Is it to be imagined, asks Count Daru, that princes will bow their\r\nsovereignty before the supremacy of the Court of Rome? Considering the\r\nprotection granted by France to the Holy See for twenty years past,\r\nshe has special duties before the world, and he, therefore, claims\r\nthat projects of laws which are to be laid before the Council shall be\r\ncommunicated to the French government, and that time shall be allowed\r\nto forward the observations that may be deemed desirable before they\r\nare pressed for decision.\r\n\r\nThe reply of Antonelli to Daru has been generally looked upon as one of\r\nthe ablest specimens of his skill. Unless at the moment the greatest\r\ndaring was the greatest skill, we must think the impression of skill\r\nis made chiefly on the minds of those who have not carefully studied\r\nthe Vatican dialect. It would seem that Count Daru, or his advisers,\r\nwere perfectly aware of the meaning of the document; and to any one\r\nwho was so, a more absolute statement of Papal suzerainty can scarcely\r\nbe conceived. The technical term \"direct\" plays an important part in\r\nthe various assertions. The Cardinal does not deny the extension of\r\nthe Papal authority to any one of the matters pointed out by Daru. He\r\nnever denies that that authority is absolute, but always takes care to\r\ncouple with the world \"absolute\" the word \"direct\"--it is not \"direct\r\nand absolute\"; and the real meaning of much of the despatch would be\r\nbrought out by the simple question, which any ecclesiastical adviser\r\nof the French Foreign Office _who was true to the government_ would\r\nask, Is it indirect and absolute? Moreover, the blank statement that\r\nthe kingly power depends upon the priestly, is, in the form in which\r\nAntonelli puts it, an extension even of the ordinary Jesuit doctrine,\r\nwhich couples the dependence of the kingly power upon the priestly\r\nwith several qualifications, practically not amounting to much, but\r\ntheoretically necessary to be kept in view, because they enable men to\r\nseem to deny what they mean to maintain. Commencing by a complimentary\r\nparagraph as to the protection of France and the gratitude of the\r\nPope, Antonelli goes on to express great surprise that the Canons\r\nshould cause so much uneasiness. They only expressed the maxims and\r\nfundamental principles of the Church, published in all forms, taught\r\nin the schools, maintained for ages, and often approved of even by\r\ncivil governments. The Church, continues Antonelli, never claims to\r\nexercise a \"direct and absolute\" power over the political rights of the\r\nState. Having received the mission to lead men, whether as individuals\r\nor as constituted into societies, to a supernatural end, the Church\r\nhad received the corresponding authority to judge the morality of all\r\nacts interior or exterior, in respect of their conformity to laws\r\nnatural and _divine_. \"As no action, whether commanded by a supreme\r\npower or freely performed by a person, can be divested of a quality of\r\nmorality or justice, it follows that the judgment of the Church, though\r\ndirectly turning upon the morality of actions, indirectly extends\r\n_to all matters with which morality is connected_.\" But this is not\r\nthe same as direct interference in political affairs, which, by the\r\norder established by God, and by the teaching indeed of the Church,\r\nbelong to the temporal power without any dependence on any authority.\r\nThe subordination of the civil power to the religious one is in the\r\nsense[314] of the superiority of the priesthood. Hence the authority\r\nof sovereignty depends on that of priesthood, as human things depend\r\non divine, and temporal on spiritual. And if temporal felicity, which\r\nis the end of civil power, is subordinate to eternal felicity, which\r\nis the spiritual end of the priesthood, it follows that to attain\r\nthe end towards which God would have them respectively tend, the one\r\npower is subordinate to the other; and thus, as between them, there\r\nexists in one of the two a subordination of functions as there exists a\r\nsubordination of ends.\r\n\r\nTherefore, proceeds the despatch, if infallibility does extend to all\r\nthat is necessary to conserve the faith, no prejudice will, on that\r\naccount, arise to science, history, or politics. Of course (we may\r\ninterject) the reasoning is, that any subordination arising from a\r\ndivinely-appointed order cannot be the cause of prejudice, but only\r\nof advantage. Infallibility, he proceeds, has been exercised in times\r\npast, and princes have had no occasion to disquiet themselves. If the\r\nChurch has been constituted by her divine founder a true and perfect\r\nSociety distinct from the civil power and independent of it, with a\r\nplenary threefold authority, legislative, judicial, and coercive, no\r\nconfusion will arise in the movements of human society, or in the\r\nexercise of the rights of the two powers. The Church does not exercise,\r\nin virtue of her authority, \"a direct and absolute\" interference in\r\nthe principles and constitutions, in the forms of civil power, in the\r\npolitical rights of citizens, in the duties of the State, and in the\r\nother matters enumerated in the despatch of the minister.\r\n\r\nAlmost the only thing not clear in the remarkable State paper in which\r\nDaru replied to this despatch,[315] is the way in which he understood\r\nthe last remarks we have quoted from the Cardinal. He speaks of them\r\nas being important, but in what sense? As showing a wish to allay the\r\nimpressions made by the Draft of Decrees, which is all the Cardinal\r\nreally professes? or as containing any statement properly calculated to\r\nallay those apprehensions? Count Daru had evidently not read hastily,\r\nand had not been without clear-headed interpreters. He could not, for a\r\nmoment, think that Antonelli had said that the Church had no authority\r\nto interfere in political matters, when he really had said no more\r\nthan that she did not _exercise_ a \"direct and absolute\" interference,\r\nby virtue of her authority. No more could Count Daru suppose that\r\nsaying that she did not do so was a promise that she would not do so,\r\nalthough, even had such a promise been made, couched in the terms\r\nemployed by Antonelli, the word \"direct\" would have deprived it of any\r\npractical value. Every other portion of Count Daru's Memorandum must\r\nhave made the Pope, to whom it was submitted, feel that the Minister of\r\nFrance understood the intentions of the Vatican.\r\n\r\n    The more one examines the doctrine of this document, the more\r\n    impossible does it become to overlook the fact that, in the\r\n    main, it amounts to the complete subordination of civil power\r\n    to the religious society.... Unless we refuse to words their\r\n    true and natural meaning, we cannot escape the conviction that\r\n    the Draft Decree on the Church has, for its object and end, the\r\n    re-establishment, in the entire world, of doctrines which would\r\n    place civil society under the empire of the clergy.... Under\r\n    the formidable sanction of the anathema, the infallibility and\r\n    authority of the Church are to be extended, not only to truths\r\n    handed down by revelation, but to all things that may appear\r\n    necessary for preserving the deposit of tradition. In other words,\r\n    her infallibility and authority have no other limits than those\r\n    which the Church may herself assign to them; and all principles of\r\n    civil order, politics, and science, fall, directly or indirectly,\r\n    within their range. It is on this almost boundless field that\r\n    the Church is to exert the right of pronouncing decisions and\r\n    promulgating laws, binding the conscience of the faithful,\r\n    independently of any confirmation on the part of the political\r\n    authority, and even in direct opposition to laws emanating from it.\r\n    It is on this domain, the bounds of which, it appears, the Church\r\n    alone may fix, that the Canons ascribe to her a complete power,\r\n    which is at once legislative, judicial, and coercive, and is to be\r\n    put forth in the external tribunal as well as in the internal,--a\r\n    power the exercise of which the Church may assure by material\r\n    penalties, and Christian princes and governments would be bound\r\n    to lend their assistance by chastising all who should attempt to\r\n    withdraw themselves from under her authority.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that Count Daru draws the inference that \"governments would\r\nretain no power, and civil society would retain no liberty, but the\r\npower and the liberty which it might please the Church to leave to\r\nthem.\" The dearest rights of States, their political constitution,\r\ntheir legislation on property, on the family, and on instruction,\r\n\"might any day be called in question by the ecclesiastical authority.\"\r\nMoreover, it is now proposed that to all this shall be added Papal\r\ninfallibility. \"_That is to say, after having concentrated all\r\npolitical and religious powers in the hand of the Church, they will\r\nconcentrate all the power of the Church in the hand of her head._\"\r\n\r\nAs to the artifice, that only principles were to be carried, but that\r\nthe application of them would not be enforced, Daru says, No such\r\nstatement suffices to reassure us. What, he asks, Are people in the\r\nforty thousand parishes of France to be taught that they are free to\r\ndo that which they are not free to believe? He will not even treat\r\nthis representation as grave. He gives the Church credit for intending\r\na serious work, and, therefore, when once she has inscribed a maxim\r\namong the immutable truths, she will try to bring it into practice. The\r\nPontiff has not assembled the bishops of the whole world to promulgate\r\nsterile laws.\r\n\r\nAntonelli had alleged that the principles in dispute were not new.\r\nThat, replied Count Daru, he knew too well, but kings and nations had\r\nnever accepted those principles, and the attempt to establish them had\r\nalways, even in the middle ages, caused bloody conflict. He concluded\r\nby declaring that if the propositions were adopted, they would have the\r\ninevitable consequence of bringing about grievous troubles.\r\n\r\nThe French government declared its intention of demanding that a\r\nspecial ambassador should be admitted to the Council. This Don\r\nMargotti hailed, first as a victory of the Council, and then as one of\r\nthe most splendid victories of Pius IX. The ground of this professed\r\nexultation was that abstinence from the Council meant the separation\r\nof Church and State. \"The Lord be praised, who is preparing greater\r\ntriumphs for His spouse!\" France trembles for her revolution and her\r\nGallicanism.[316] So can voice and face be changed in a moment.\r\n\r\nBeust, in further despatches, declined any proposal for sending\r\nambassadors to the Council, on the ground that governments would,\r\nby such an act, make themselves, in some sort, parties to its\r\nproceedings. He had laid down and firmly adhered to the principle of\r\nabiding within the line of purely political action. That principle, he\r\ndeclared, fully covered the two steps of interdicting all publications\r\nexciting to contempt of the law, and punishing all persons guilty of\r\nany contempt of it.[317] But he instructed Count Trauttmansdorff to\r\nsupport the French with all cordiality, in the demand that matters\r\ntouching political interests, which were submitted to the Council,\r\nshould be communicated to France before being enacted. But, on the\r\npart of the State, he could not take up theological arguments or plead\r\nthe interests of the Catholic Church. He would take his stand on the\r\ninterests of the State only, and tell the Court of Rome that, if it\r\nprovoked a conflict, Austria would not give way to its decisions. For\r\nsimilar reasons, he must abstain from identifying the government with\r\nthe bishops of the minority. Approving and sympathizing with their\r\nposition, he nevertheless felt that they might come to change their\r\nground, and accept what the government could not accept.\r\n\r\nThe French government applied, also, to the North German Confederation\r\nto support its representatives. Bismarck was deliberate but firm. On\r\nApril 23,[318] Arnim sent in a despatch, cordially supporting the\r\nclaims put forward by Daru. He said, that the Decrees, so far from\r\nbeing any vague menace for the future, were rather calculated to\r\nrevive, and surround with a new dogmatic sanction, certain pontifical\r\nDecrees sufficiently known, and constantly combated by civil society\r\nin every age, and of every nation. An earnest wish to shun a collision\r\npervaded the despatch.\r\n\r\nThe impression made upon the Curia by these appeals may perhaps\r\nbe better gathered from Don Margotti and M. Veuillot than from\r\nAntonelli's despatches. On March 3 the _Unitá Cattolica_ says, France\r\nand Austria have really remonstrated against the proposed definition\r\nof infallibility. They are afraid of the doctrine of Christ. If they\r\nwould only adopt the Council and its doctrine, it would restore even\r\ntheir finances. \"Do make an experiment. You have tried a thousand\r\nconstitutions in France and Austria: why should you disdain to try\r\nthe true Catholic constitution?\" Let those two countries faithfully\r\nproclaim the doctrine, accept and spread it among the people, \"and in\r\nless than a year you will confess that it is a great salvation for\r\nthe French and Austrian empires.\" This is followed by a letter from a\r\nprofessor of theology on the opportuneness of defining the dogma of the\r\npersonal infallibility of the Pope. He contends first that it would--\r\n\r\n    give a blow to Liberalism, which is the doctrine of human\r\n    infallibility; for representative assemblies claim a true\r\n    infallibility, because the decrees of such assemblies _are not\r\n    reformable by the Church_; but if a single man alone is declared\r\n    infallible, they all, whether individually or collectively, become\r\n    fallible, and must receive from him their rules in jurisprudence\r\n    and legislation, and every institution or ordinance declared by\r\n    the Pontiff not to be good is, without appeal, rejected as false\r\n    and corrupt. Liberalism, wherever it prevails, converts rulers\r\n    into tyrants and subjects into slaves! The spectacle of seven\r\n    hundred bishops giving up all to the Pope will restore the idea of\r\n    legitimate authority.\r\n\r\nAnticipating the _final_ struggle against the Church, he says, \"It is\r\nof the utmost importance that the Church bind up her people in the\r\nfirmest unity; for the battle will be sore, and she will escape only by\r\ndivine intervention.\" On March 4, the _Unitá_ says that the Council is\r\nassailed by traitors. The devil always has a foot in good things, but\r\nhe has two in the Council. Satan entered into the deputies of Italy,\r\nthen into the body of Prince Hohenlohe, then he passed on to Döllinger,\r\nto Père Hyacinth, and to Père Gratry. The devil had entered into the\r\ncabinets of Beust and Daru, and into the palace at Munich, where\r\nDöllinger had been admitted to the same honours as formerly had been\r\ngranted to Lola Montez.\r\n\r\nM. Veuillot[319] imagines a conversation between a Catholic and a\r\nLiberal Catholic, of which the following is a condensation. It shows\r\nthe kind of information which was granted, and the kind of argument\r\nwhich was welcome, to the forty thousand educated men on whom largely\r\ndepends the fate of all French governments _which attempt to govern\r\nthrough them_:--\r\n\r\n    The governments are displeased.---- Why?---- Because!---- What\r\n    of that?---- You offend common sense. The cause is the dogma of\r\n    infallibility.---- But the Holy Spirit?---- It was not the Holy\r\n    Spirit that signed the petition for infallibility.---- Did He sign\r\n    the other?---- The other is inspired by the highest wisdom.---- So\r\n    be it. Both call upon the Holy Spirit and He will come.---- He will\r\n    not come.----Why?---- The Rules of the Council are bad, the Hall is\r\n    defective, discussion is impossible, the Council is not free.----\r\n    What? the Fathers can read, study, pray, speak, and the Council is\r\n    not free!---- No, discussion is physically impossible, and it is\r\n    from the shock of discussion that light breaks out just as from\r\n    the concussion of flints.---- The Council has no need of that kind\r\n    of light which fires powder.---- The governments are up against\r\n    infallibility.---- Let them come down.---- They'll make you come\r\n    down yourself.---- Allow me, if you speak to me, upon my word of\r\n    honour, I am not the Council; and if you speak to the Council, it\r\n    will answer, as it always has done to good advisers of your sort.\r\n\r\n    I fear God, dear Abner.\r\n\r\nAfter this comes what with M. Veuillot's readers passes for argument,\r\nIn the present state of law in regard to religious liberty, governments\r\nhave nothing to do with infallibility but to study the new situation\r\nwhich it will create, and to conform their conduct to it, as liberty\r\nrequires of them. Either they will voluntarily respect liberty, or they\r\nwill encounter its defenders and sustain the combat. The governments\r\nought to know that Catholics mean not to give up anything of their\r\nright, and of the fulness of their life. As to the Church, continues\r\nM. Veuillot, she manages her affairs as it suits her. She looks\r\nbeyond governments, beyond generations. She sows for the future, she\r\nconstructs for centuries. Although she desires not to put governments\r\nto inconvenience, _it must be allowed that her compassion and her\r\ncomplaisance towards these foreigners must have their limits_. She\r\nbears the heavy burden of freedom of worship, and she takes the light\r\nadvantages of it.\r\n\r\nFurther on we find the same sinister reference to disturbances as in\r\nDon Margotti (p. 246):--\r\n\r\n    A letter is talked of from one of our ministers, who, it would\r\n    appear, says that the difficulty of the government is not in Paris\r\n    but in Rome. While this letter of the statesman is being read in\r\n    Rome, barricades are springing up under his feet in Paris, and\r\n    barricades are difficulties.... The head of the Church is always a\r\n    great statesman, and ends by solving the difficulty. When statesmen\r\n    will go to school to the Pope they will do marvels; but the world\r\n    must not look for that just yet.\r\n\r\nIt is well known, says M. Veuillot, returning to the sore point of\r\nthe hints thrown out by Daru about withdrawing the troops, that if\r\nDaru withdraws the French sentinel from the door of the Council, many\r\nsentinels would be withdrawn from other doors in France (vol. i. p.\r\n328). No wonder that Italians speak of the _Univers_ and the _Rappel_\r\nas kindred, if hostile. Rochefort and Veuillot are the two poles of the\r\nsame violent hatred of ordered liberties and moderated power.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 309: _Fromman_, p. 91.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 310: _Friedberg_, p. 547.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 311: _Friedberg_, p. 549.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 312: _Friedberg_, p. 563.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 313: _Friedberg_, p. 533.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 314: The expression is peculiar.

There resided Dupanloup, too much courted\r\nfor the pride of those who thought that any man in Rome who opposed\r\nthe Curia ought to be ostracised. We do not remember any public hint\r\ngiven to the police to watch the villa, such as the _Unitá Cattolica_\r\nbroadly gave as to the Palazzo Valentini, the residence of Cardinal\r\nHohenlohe (February 26). But the amiabilities of the \"good press\" were\r\nnot denied to the Villa Grazioli. Bishop Wicart, of Laval, wrote to his\r\nlocal organ, insisting that every word of his letter should be printed,\r\nand saying that the talk about Monseigneur Dupanloup in the diocese of\r\nLaval must be put an end to. \"I declare, before God, and in readiness\r\nto appear at His judgment-seat, that I had rather die--fall dead on\r\nthe spot--than follow the Bishop of Orleans in the course he is now\r\ntaking.\"[320]\r\n\r\nIt was not to this attack exclusively that Dupanloup referred in a\r\nletter to the chapter of his cathedral:--\r\n\r\n    The spectacle will have been exhibited of a bishop who had, during\r\n    a life already long, given strong proofs of devotion to the Church\r\n    and to the Papacy, becoming all at once the butt for insult and for\r\n    those indignities against which you protest, because on a capital\r\n    question he said what he believed, and still believes, to be for\r\n    the true interests of religion and of the Papacy.[321]\r\n\r\nEbullitions like this were but a sample of the increasing irritation\r\non both sides. The majority naturally wanted to have done with the\r\nstrife, the result of which was already certain. Vitelleschi says that\r\nthe Curia desired that the Council should be merely a great ceremony\r\nfor the solemn fulfilment of a pre-arranged program (p. 76). They\r\nbitterly accused the minority of egging on the governments to oppose\r\nthe Council, to menace the Church, to insult the Holy Father, or even\r\nto dictate to the Holy Ghost. Every objection to the new dogma was\r\ndenounced as rebellion against the Pontiff, hostility to the Council,\r\ndisloyalty to Peter, and so forth. Documents such as those of Beust\r\nand Daru were a complete reversal of all that was right. At the moment\r\nwhen Rome was \"officially taking the affairs of the world in hand,\"\r\nit was insufferable for people representing provinces such as Austria\r\nor France, to attempt to control the Mistress of the world. Strictly\r\nspeaking, Beust and Daru did not represent those two provinces any\r\nmore than Menabrea represented Italy. They represented only the carnal\r\nand inordinate jealousy of the supernatural order entertained by the\r\nnatural order in those provinces. They must be made to learn the\r\nmeaning of the commission, \"Teach all nations.\"\r\n\r\nThe members of the minority, trained by Rome to rush to statesmen and\r\nimportune them for everything that could serve the Church, now that\r\nthey believed her to be drifting to a terrible peril, did as they had\r\nbeen accustomed to do. Personally they were stung by hard words, not\r\nonly from the Pope, but from all officials down to small diocesan\r\neditors, emulous of Don Margotti and M. Veuillot. Even priests in their\r\nown dioceses were set against them. As a party, the minority were\r\nirritated by restraint, suspicion, manoeuvres, affronts, offers, and\r\neven by _espionage_. Their one solace was, they felt, a vain one. They\r\ncould indeed speak, but they could not really debate. Their one refuge\r\nwas vainer still. They could draw up petitions, but they might as well\r\naddress them to Julius Cæsar for any answer that was ever vouchsafed.\r\nThe air was full of complaints of long speeches. Some proposed that\r\nno more should be read, some that no more should be delivered in any\r\nform; but that they should be written, printed, and distributed among\r\nthe Fathers. Some combined the two propositions, suggesting that only\r\n_they_ should deliver speeches who could do so _extempore_, and that\r\nthe others should print theirs for those who liked to read them. The\r\n_Unitá Cattolica_ hailed the proposal to have no more speeches; it\r\nwould shorten the Council.\r\n\r\nOthers, again, tried to form a third party, on the basis of some\r\ncompromise which would satisfy the Court by giving it in substance all\r\nthe concentration of power it wanted, and yet would save the minority\r\nfrom the difficulty of accepting Papal infallibility in express terms.\r\nBishop Vitelleschi was named in connexion with this attempt. They who\r\nmade it did not fully realize either the political or the theological\r\nbearing of the points at issue. The whole conduct of future operations\r\nmust depend on the ability of the central authority to act at any\r\nmoment and in any place, without the remotest fear of hesitation\r\nor delay on the part of the instruments; above all, without any\r\npossibility of that old bugbear, an appeal to a General Council, being\r\nraised up again.\r\n\r\nThe pretensions which Pius IX had set up under the veil of secrecy now\r\nbegan, through publicity, to drag Rome on to her doom. She would not\r\nhave dared, at first, to face governments with her present claims. She\r\nhad silently spread them in her schools, had excited her fancy with the\r\nechoes of them coming back mysteriously from provincial synods and from\r\nepiscopal thrones, had shaped them into formulæ, one part of which her\r\nfears had cast away, and another part of which publicity had put to\r\nshame. Some now asked her to stop when the coach was at full swing down\r\nhill! The attempt to do so would be attended with extreme danger. She\r\nwould lose, not only the new authority at which she had been grasping,\r\nbut also a considerable part of the old authority, out of which that\r\nwas to have been developed.\r\n\r\nThe Canons which had been the occasion of the protest from governments\r\ncould indeed well be spared, if the supreme authority and infallible\r\njudgement of the sovereign were proclaimed but without that the Canons\r\nwould be paper laws in the hand of a discredited administration\r\nThe Syllabus, cried M. Veuillot, had lighted a torch, five years\r\nbeforehand, by which to study the objects of the Council (vol. i.\r\np. 55). The Curia had studied the objects during the five years by\r\nthat light. For it retreat on the main point was now an absolute\r\nimpossibility. Had France really withdrawn her troops, the Curia could\r\nhave broken up the Council under the justification of physical fear,\r\nand so would have escaped the dilemma by an intervention of Providence.\r\nBut it was not to be. And we may as well here slightly anticipate our\r\nnarrative, in order to complete the incident of the French note. Daru\r\nwas one of the ministers who resigned on finding out that the Emperor's\r\nprofessions of setting up a responsible ministry were such as to remind\r\none of the _mot_ attributed to Dupin, at the very height Napoleon's\r\npower: \"It is really too bad: one cannot now believe even the opposite\r\nof what he says.\"\r\n\r\nIt was reported in Rome that, within twenty-four hours, two telegrams\r\nhad arrived from Paris. The first read: \"Decidedly Daru will not have\r\ninfallibility. He announces that there will be a rupture.\" The second\r\nread: \"Daru retires. Ollivier replaces him. The Council free.\" If\r\nit is true, cried M. Veuillot, it is glorious for M. Ollivier (vol.\r\ni. p. 462). The despatch of Ollivier, on taking over the office of\r\nForeign Affairs from Daru, would have been thought straightforward\r\nif proceeding from any Court but such a one as that of the Tuileries\r\nthen was. After stating that the Emperor had not sent an ambassador to\r\nthe Council, and had scrupulously abstained from interfering with its\r\nproceedings, but that recently, when warned by the rumours in Europe of\r\ndangers menacing the cause of religion, he had for a moment stepped out\r\nof his reserve and offered counsel, Ollivier proceeds:--\r\n\r\n    The Holy Father has not seen it right to listen to our counsels,\r\n    nor to accept our observations. We do not insist, and we resume our\r\n    attitude of reserve and expectation.\r\n\r\n    You will not seek or accept, henceforth, any conversation, either\r\n    with the Pope or with Cardinal Antonelli, on the affairs of the\r\n    Council.\r\n\r\n    You will confine yourself to gaining information, and keeping\r\n    yourself acquainted with facts, with the sentiments which have\r\n    prepared them, and with the impressions which have followed\r\n    them.[322]\r\n\r\nSo terminated an incident that caused, for a time, a considerable\r\nflutter, and seems to have offered to the Curia the only fair escape\r\nfrom the dilemma into which it had got. It was now felt that the\r\nlegislation necessary to put the new constitution into working order,\r\nmust be pressed into as small a space of time as possible. The\r\nrestoration of ideas had not advanced satisfactorily since the meeting\r\nof the Council and the restoration of facts had made no progress at\r\nall. The voluminous Drafts had already brought Court theology into\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nFriedrich had spent an evening and morning in writing to Lord Acton\r\non the Papal system as developed in the Draft Decree on the Church,\r\nand in expressing his fears that the bishops would not see through\r\nit, when a piece of news reached him, which though at ordinary times\r\nit would scarcely have been talked of in Rome, just then caused some\r\nexcitement (p. 143). It was, as he relates, to the effect that Audu,\r\nPatriarch of Babylon, after having spoken in opposition to the Curia,\r\nhad, as we have seen (page 107 of _this_ edition), been sent for at\r\nnight by the Pope, who allowed no witness of the interview but Valerga,\r\nthe so-called Patriarch of Jerusalem, who, however, as Vitelleschi\r\nsays, was, previous to his elevation, simply a Roman ecclesiastic.\r\nValerga acted as interpreter. The Pope raged, commanded the weak\r\nold man to resign his patriarchate, forced a pen into his hand, and\r\nceased not storming till it was done. Then, to give practical effect\r\nto the resignation, two bishops, not chosen by Audu, were appointed,\r\nand he must consecrate them.[323] Such was the tale. Friedrich took\r\nit as a sample of infallibility in practice even before the Council\r\nhad sanctioned it in theory. In itself, the story would seem very\r\nimprobable in London, but not at all so in Constantinople or Rome. In\r\nthe latter city the reputation of Pius IX is high for fits of rage,\r\nin which his best friends are treated like lackeys. Liverani, who over\r\nand over again calls him an angel, tells nevertheless several stories\r\nof conduct to those about him which, if they could be told of an\r\nEnglish squire, would not get him the name of angel from his stewards\r\nand bailiffs. Even the all but adoring editor of the _Speeches_ gives\r\na specimen which evidently hammered a deep dint into his Neapolitan\r\nsensibilities. If the tales are true, the rage passes away, giving\r\nplace to habitual jocoseness.\r\n\r\nVitelleschi says that an alternative was set before the Chaldean\r\nPatriarch--either he must submit to the Pope's authority as to certain\r\nappointments, or resign. Being reduced to this extremity by his\r\nimperious brother, the poor old man did resign, and the event \"created\r\na great sensation.\" To the Roman nobleman the scene presented no\r\nimprobability. He does not even hint that it is a rare specimen of the\r\ntranquil waters which lie behind St. Peter's Rock. The noise made by\r\nthe rumours forced even so great a person as M. Veuillot to take notice\r\nof them. His usual style of contradiction is very striking, and perhaps\r\ninstructive. He will spend, it may be, pages in making somebody, who\r\nhas said something, look extremely ridiculous; but, at the end, you\r\nwonder what he has contradicted. On the present occasion, however, M.\r\nVeuillot did stoop to particulars. First, he says that the Patriarch\r\nhad himself chosen two bishops, but after the Pope had approved of\r\nthem, he refused to consecrate them. This is in direct contradiction of\r\na statement, on the other side, that the Propaganda had chosen the two\r\nbishops in question and that the Patriarch refused to consecrate them.\r\nThe latter version gives a clear cause of dispute, whereas that of M.\r\nVeuillot leaves the resistance of the Patriarch, as he himself says,\r\ninexplicable. But as to what took place, his account is this:--\r\n\r\n    The Pope called the Patriarch into his cabinet, and told him to\r\n    consecrate the two suffragans in twenty-four hours, or to sign\r\n    his resignation. The Patriarch asked for a delay of three days,\r\n    then of two days. The Pope was inflexible; he required that the\r\n    Patriarch should forthwith sign the engagement to obey. The\r\n    Patriarch took a pen, and began to write; but he stopped, saying\r\n    that the pen would not go. The Pope presented him with a penknife.\r\n    The Patriarch of Jerusalem, who acted as interpreter, mended\r\n    the pen. The Chaldean Patriarch resisted no further. He wrote\r\n    the engagement to consecrate the two bishops, or to abdicate in\r\n    twenty-four hours, and pushed his precision so far as to affix the\r\n    date--half-past seven in the evening. The next morning he performed\r\n    the consecration.\r\n\r\nM. Veuillot vehemently denies that the Pope was in a rage, or that he\r\nbroke pens with his fist, or that he played the part of a tyrant. He\r\nseems to take it for granted that good Catholics ought to be edified\r\nwith his own account of this rehearsal of a scene in the forthcoming\r\ndrama of \"ordinary and immediate jurisdiction\" in all dioceses of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWe have hinted that Vitelleschi expresses no feeling of improbability\r\nas to the tale of the Chaldean Patriarch. On the contrary, he\r\nimmediately follows it up by alluding to rumours of proceedings\r\ncontemplated by the Propaganda against certain bishops under its\r\njurisdiction, who had manifested a want of docility in seconding\r\nits projects (p. 82). These rumours, he says, revived uncomfortable\r\nrecollections of the Inquisition, adding that events of this nature\r\nare of common occurrence, and might happen a thousand times without\r\nattracting much notice. But the moment was exceptional.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the General Congregations, from the time when the\r\nmovement for the definition of infallibility declared itself, centred\r\nin that impending question, and but faintly, and intermittently, swayed\r\ntowards any other. The particular matter now on hand was a proposal\r\nto do away with the diocesan Catechisms throughout the world, and to\r\nadopt a uniform one for all. Outside the Church of Rome this would\r\nprobably have seemed a natural point of uniformity, but, inside of it,\r\nthe determination of the municipal _coterie_ to drive roughshod over\r\nall that was homely or ancient, all that was national or local, roused\r\nthe spirit of opposition. It was clearly felt that taking away from the\r\nbishops the right of approving their own Catechisms was a further blow\r\nat their authority. For many years past the Jesuits had been altering\r\nCatechisms, and so gradually naturalizing the doctrine of infallibility\r\non soil hostile to it, especially through schools conducted by\r\nnuns.[324] They had made the Catechism a great financial success. A new\r\none for the whole world would be an estate for the Curia.\r\n\r\nThe book of the Abbé Michaud, _De la Falsification du Catéchism_, is\r\na curious study. He expresses the sum of his researches by saying\r\nthat Catholicism has been replaced by Popery. The old Paris Catechism\r\ndid not use the expression \"the _Roman_ Church.\" It always said,\r\n\"the Catholic Church\"; and in some Catechisms, in France, the word\r\n\"Roman\" first came in as late as 1839, and that only in a profession\r\nof faith at the end: \"I acknowledge the Holy Catholic Apostolic and\r\nRoman Church.\" Noting the progressive change in definitions of the\r\nChurch, Michaud gives examples, showing that the earliest do not even\r\nmention the Pope, and that the latest speak of nothing but the Pope (p.\r\n23). The early Catechisms call Christ the Foundation of the Church;\r\nsucceeding ones give this title to the Confession of St. Peter; next\r\nto the Apostles, then to Peter, and, finally, to the Pope; and some\r\nrecent ones even say that the Church is founded on the Papacy (p.\r\n34). The designation the \"Head of the Church,\" is gradually withdrawn\r\nfrom Christ, to be bestowed upon the Pope. One Catechism, as early\r\nas 1756, said that the visible Head of the Church, being subordinate\r\nto the Invisible one, made only one Head with Him. On the question\r\nof the seat of authority in the Church, a precisely similar process\r\nhas taken place; and infallibility has followed in the same track.\r\nFormerly, says the Abbé it was believed that the Pope had no authority\r\nor infallibility but through the Church. Now, it is declared that the\r\nChurch has no authority or infallibility but through the Pope. We may\r\nremark that the terms of the Vatican Decrees do not go so far as the\r\nlast assertion. The framers meant to do so, but their logic failed\r\nthem, and they have left a dualism full of future perplexity. The Abbé\r\nshows that the Catechisms of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,\r\nand many down to the year 1843, always speak of the infallibility\r\nof the Church. Later, the term, \"the infallibility of the Teaching\r\nChurch,\" is introduced. That means, of the Pope and the bishops.\r\nMichaud does not quote any with this terminology earlier than 1786. But\r\nthat could not suffice for the Romanists. The Abbé says that, at the\r\npresent time they teach, not only that the Pope is infallible, but that\r\nhe is the source of infallibility. \"As the Church was replaced by the\r\nTeaching Church, the Teaching Church has been replaced by the Pope.\" A\r\nreligious and political system shifting in this fashion does not well\r\nbear even that kind of check which is afforded by the existence of\r\ndifferent Catechisms in neighbouring dioceses. It was not quite so easy\r\nto teach at Rouen that the Pope singly is infallible, when at Paris the\r\nCatechism said that the Church was infallible, and at Cologne it said\r\nplainly that the Pope was not infallible. And the fact of this tendency\r\nto change doctrine downward, and further downward, was a reason for a\r\nfeeling against one Catechism stronger than could be understood in any\r\ncommunity with a fixed rule of faith.\r\n\r\nThe changes made in the application to the Church of the word\r\n\"believe,\" are equally curious. The old form of words as to believing\r\nin one Catholic Church was first changed into believing in the Teaching\r\nChurch. Then \"respect and obedience to the Pope\" began to be inserted,\r\nfrom the end of the seventeenth century onward. In 1819 an Arras\r\nCatechism claimed \"sovereign respect\"; but so far there is no mention\r\nof belief in decisions of the Pope. It was in 1834 that the Catechisms\r\nof Avignon and Amiens prepared for the transition from \"respect\" to\r\n\"belief,\" by teaching the necessity of inviolable attachment to all\r\nthat the Pope teaches. The consummation so prepared for was not far\r\noff The St. Brieuc Catechism of 1835, and that of the Abbé Guillois of\r\n1851, taught that it is necessary and Catholic to believe in the Pope\r\nas well as in the Church.\r\n\r\nThe transition from \"belief\" to \"the faith\" is very easy. Originally,\r\nthe _dépôt_ of the faith, which the Church had to guard, and to which\r\nno man could add, and from which no man could take away, was called\r\nThe Doctrine of Christ. Then it began to be called The Doctrine of\r\nthe Apostles; later, The Doctrine of the Successors of the Apostles;\r\nand, after that, The Doctrine of the Prince of the Successors of the\r\nApostles; and, finally, of course, The Doctrine of the Pope (p. 76).\r\nThe new and uniform shorter Catechism (_De Parvo Catechismo_) was to\r\nbe modelled on that of Bellarmine, others being consulted. No hint was\r\ngiven as to how it was to be prepared, and the bishops raised many\r\ndoubts. Should it not be submitted to the Council? Or, if that was not\r\ndone, surely it would not be made obligatory, but only recommended.\r\nOthers would have twelve bishops elected by the Council itself to\r\nprepare it. Some wished that, when prepared, three years should be\r\ngiven for the bishops to examine and test it; and then that only after\r\nhaving been approved by them should it be made binding. None of these\r\nguards against centralization found any favour.\r\n\r\nThe complaints about the Rules, and the desire of the majority for\r\nsomething to expedite business, were to produce some effect at last.\r\nWhen between two and three months had passed without a single one of\r\nthe much-prepared Drafts being homologated, as the Scotch would say, by\r\nthe Council, it was time to do something. The plan of shaping Rules for\r\nthe Council without the bishops was resorted to once more. New Rules\r\nwere given out as an edict, just as the original ones had been, and\r\nwere headed _A Decree_, as if the Council itself had framed them. To\r\nallow the conclave to make rules for itself, or to amend those imposed\r\nupon it, would have been a dangerous approximation to ancient conciliar\r\nforms. It had become even clearer than had been foreseen, that a free\r\nCouncil would be a less docile instrument than the sort of Secret\r\nConsistory which had been so cleverly devised.\r\n\r\nThe statement of Vitelleschi, that the Rules provided for the printing\r\nof the speeches and their distribution among the Fathers, is not\r\ncorrect; and his further statement, that they gave the Presidents\r\nthe right of cutting short any speaker, is inexact. All they give is\r\nthe ordinary right of calling a speaker back to the question, _ad\r\npropositam quæstionem ipsum revocare_.[325] But it is a different\r\nquestion, whether the Presidents did not take this as containing the\r\npower of cutting a speaker short. Immediately after its promulgation,\r\nHaynald made a quotation to prove that a Pope had, at the time when the\r\nBreviary was being revised, expressed an opinion contrary to that now\r\nheld by the majority, and the President immediately requested him, says\r\nVitelleschi, to come down from the pulpit. That certainly is much more\r\nthan calling him back to the question. Friedrich relates this scene\r\nas one in which signs of impatience, given both by voice and feet,\r\nwere general among the majority, even Cardinals making demonstrations.\r\nSo Cardinal Capalti seized the bell and called the speaker to the\r\nquestion. The Archbishop insisted that it was the duty of the majority\r\nto hear him; but Capalti told him that they evidently would not hear\r\nhim, and he must stop.[326]\r\n\r\n_La Liberté du Concile_ adds an important particular.[327] Haynald had\r\nbeen attacked by a Belgian bishop for an opinion expressed by him in a\r\nspeech. He immediately asked leave to reply; and, in order to observe\r\nthe Rules to the letter, he went to the _bureau_ of the Presidents, and\r\nrequested leave to speak on a personal point--the false interpretation\r\nput upon his speech. Leave was refused, but the Presidents told him\r\nthat he could take the opportunity of explaining when he should speak\r\nin another debate. He waited for weeks. On the day now in question,\r\nbefore commencing to speak, he told the President that, after his\r\nspeech, he meant to reply to the attack which had long before been\r\nmade upon him. He was authorized to do so. But no sooner had he begun\r\nto present his personal defence, than the majority interrupted him\r\nwith violent clamour. Instead of enforcing respect for the dignity of\r\nthe Council and the liberty of speech, one of the Presidents cried to\r\nthe speaker, \"You see that they will not hear you.\" And when Haynald\r\nrepresented that he had been authorized to defend himself, \"Hold your\r\npeace and come down\" (_Taceas et descendas_), cried Cardinal Capalti,\r\nwho thus took the place of Cardinal De Angelis, the Senior President.\r\n\r\nIt was on February 22 that the new Rules were delivered, and on March\r\n1 more than one hundred prelates, of all nations, sent in a solemn\r\nprotest to the Presiding Cardinals. This was all they could do, short\r\nof leaving the Council. They begin by pointing out that the new Rules\r\nprofessed to preserve the liberty due to bishops of the Catholic\r\nChurch; but that, in most respects, it seemed as if their liberty was\r\ndiminished by them, and even exposed to abolition.[328] The Rules said\r\nthat, when new Drafts of Decrees were distributed, the Fathers were to\r\nsend in their remarks and suggestions in writing, and the Presidents\r\nwould allow a suitable time for so doing. The petitioners represent\r\nthat this might do for ordinary matters, but when grave questions of\r\ndogma were to be discussed, the time allowed should be very ample, and\r\nthe wishes of those who wanted an extension of it should be met.\r\n\r\nThe Rules said that, after the committee had considered such remarks\r\nand suggestions as might have been sent in, they should present the\r\nDraft to the Council amended, and with it a summary report containing\r\na _mention_ of the remarks and suggestions which had been made. The\r\nhundred bishops say that a mention is not enough. That would leave the\r\ncommittee free to omit what it pleased. The remarks and suggestions\r\nought to be given at full, else the committee would become the entire\r\nCouncil, and, in most things, the only judge.[329] Moreover, the\r\nreasons assigned by authors of remarks and suggestions should also\r\nbe given. They request, further, that authors of suggestions should\r\nhave the right of explaining them, and, if need be, of defending them\r\nbefore the committee. The idea of a right of reply, which the original\r\nRules had completely ignored, had been, after a fashion, introduced\r\ninto the new ones. That is, the members of the committee were to have\r\nthe right of reply, either at once or on a later day, to any one\r\nspeaker, or to a number of them. The hundred bishops do not challenge\r\nthis immense power granted to the committee, but they demand that the\r\nspeaker so replied to shall have his right of rejoinder.\r\n\r\nThe hundred strongly reclaim against a provision for closing a\r\ndiscussion by a rising and sitting vote. This, they say, is a mode of\r\nvoting unknown in Councils, and is liable to haste, to error, and to\r\nthe contagion of momentary feeling. It might be quite allowable in\r\nparliamentary proceedings, where a thing done this year may be undone\r\nthe next. But it is not admissible in a case where the matters in hand\r\nare so awful and irrevocable as Decrees, which once adopted are never\r\nto be amended or discussed again. They demand that no question should\r\nbe closed so long as any one who had not spoken claimed his right to\r\ndo so as a witness and a judge of the faith. They demand also that\r\nspeakers should be heard alternately, one for and one against any\r\nproposal under consideration; and, moreover, in matters affecting the\r\nfaith, that no discussion should be closed so long as fifty Fathers\r\nobjected. They strongly urge that, in a General Council, neither\r\nprecedent nor propriety requires that many Decrees rashly adopted shall\r\nbe preferred to a few thoroughly sifted.\r\n\r\nThey then come to the solemn point, as to how many votes suffice to\r\nmake a dogma? The new Rules did not require a majority of two-thirds,\r\nas many political constitutions provide in a case of importance.\r\nThey left the decision open to a simple majority. This the hundred\r\nbishops treat as a total and astounding novelty. In General Councils,\r\nmoral unanimity in matters of dogma had been the rule. It was a rule\r\naccepted, and avowedly acted upon, at Trent, by Pius IV. No other rule\r\nwould be consistent with the principle of Vincent of Lerins, \"What has\r\nbeen believed always, everywhere, and by all.\" Catholic dogmas being\r\nformed by consent of the Churches, it followed that they could not be\r\ndefined in a Council except by the consent, morally unanimous, of the\r\nbishops who represent those Churches. They assert that this condition\r\nis the pivot on which the whole Council turns. This condition, they\r\nproceed to say, seems to be the more urgent in the Vatican Council,\r\nbecause so many Fathers were admitted to vote, as to whom it was not\r\nclear whether they held their title to do so by ecclesiastical or by\r\ndivine right.\r\n\r\nThus indicating the fact that, first, a majority had been made up\r\nlargely of men who represented nothing, and that now that majority was\r\nto be used to change, not only the dogmas of the Church, but the very\r\nsource and criterion of dogma, they proceed to a sorrowful declaration,\r\nthat unless the point as to the numbers voting was conceded, their\r\nconsciences would be burdened with an intolerable weight. They should\r\nhave fears that the oecumenical character of the Council would be\r\ncalled in question; that a handle would be given to enemies for attacks\r\non the Holy See and on the Council; and that thus the authority of\r\nthe Council would be undermined among the Christian people, as though\r\nit had been lacking in truth and liberty; and in these troublous\r\ntimes that would be a calamity so great that a worse could not be\r\nimagined.[330]\r\n\r\n    \"Thus,\" cries _La Liberté du Concile_, \"you have a hundred bishops\r\n    who say, Oppression is couched in these Rules. We have liberty\r\n    indeed, but liberty restrained, garrotted; which can be choked\r\n    whenever they like. _Imo etiam tolli posse videatur._ They say\r\n    more. They say that these Rules contain a grave menace, a flagrant\r\n    violation of Catholic tradition, an intolerable oppression of their\r\n    conscience, pregnant with the greatest perils for the future,\r\n    capable of striking the Council to the heart and of inducing\r\n    incalculable misfortunes. That is said by one hundred bishops.\"\r\n\r\nThe foundation formed by such a rule of faith as the consent of the\r\nChurches seemed solid as long as streams were shut off, but now that\r\nthe waters were rising the bishops began to feel symptoms of a shaking.\r\nThey did not, however, yet know that one rush from a sluice, to be\r\nsuddenly opened by the Pope himself, was, ere they rose, to bear that\r\nsand clean away, and to drop them down on to a rotten rock of Roman\r\ninfallibility. Even the consent of the Church was to be dispensed with.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, learned bodies in Germany had hastened to support\r\nDöllinger. Public addresses came to him from the universities of Bonn,\r\nPrague, and Breslau, and from colleges in other places, bearing the\r\nbest names of German Catholics in letters and science. The towns,\r\nemulating the colleges, joined in the movement; Cologne, Kempten,\r\nFreiburg-in-Brisgau, and other places sending in addresses. Munich\r\nvoted to the venerable scholar an honorary citizenship, which he\r\nmodestly declined. It was evident that the German people would have\r\nfollowed in large numbers in the movement thus begun, but the bishops\r\nwho, in Rome seemed to be earnest in opposing the Curia, suppressed\r\nall attempts to discourage it on the part of their clergy or people.\r\nThey had woven a tangled web at Fulda, and were getting deeper and\r\ndeeper into its meshes. On the other side, the Pope, the Curia, and\r\nthe Infallibilist bishops did everything possible to bring pressure to\r\nbear upon the bishops of the Opposition, both from the clergy and from\r\nthe people. As with Hildebrand, so now, all authority which did not\r\nmove at the beck of \"Peter,\" was overturned or overmatched by raising\r\nsubordinates at the call of the higher power. Döllinger had said, in\r\nreply to an address, that he had done no more than maintain views in\r\nwhich, as to the substance, he was at one with the majority of the\r\nGerman prelates. This was in Rome skilfully turned into a reason for\r\ndemands upon those prelates. Signor Aloysi, evidently by commission of\r\nthe Pope, proposed to the Archbishop of Munich to disavow Döllinger,\r\nand to procure a collective disavowal from the German bishops. This the\r\nArchbishop declined to do.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly fair to conclude that the German bishops made a show of\r\nopposition merely to be able to say to the people, We resisted till\r\nthe word was spoken, as you did; but now that it is spoken, we submit,\r\nand so must you. In addition to calculations of this kind there was\r\nprobably a consciousness that a mortal struggle was rising between\r\nRome and all the religion, freedom and light in the outside world,\r\nand that it would go hard with Rome. The only possible counterpoise\r\nto their fear of the Pope would have been a movement on the part of\r\ngovernments to separate the Church from the State. But the politicians\r\nwere as little prepared for that as the bishops were for schism. So,\r\nboth the one and the other, however involuntarily, concurred in helping\r\nRome on towards the catastrophe. Ketteler proposed that the German\r\nbishops should disavow Döllinger, but could not carry his point.[331]\r\nHe disavowed him on his own account. Senestrey forbade theological\r\nstudents of his diocese to attend the classes of Döllinger; but Scherr,\r\nArchbishop of Munich, refused to do even this. The press, however,\r\nmade amends for the slackness of the Ordinary. M. Veuillot told how\r\nDöllinger's father had said that the devil of a boy had two heads\r\nand no heart, and how, in his Cathedral stall, he did not know how\r\nto handle his breviary, and sometimes read, instead of it, proofs of\r\nhis books. Quirinus might, indeed, say, \"It is no longer possible to\r\nconceal by any periphrasis the fact that the spirit the Opposition\r\nhas to combat is no other than the spirit of lying\" (p. 260). But the\r\nwriters of the Curia charged upon all Opposition writers, not only\r\nhatred, malice and all uncharitableness, but especially lying, with the\r\nloving and making of lies.\r\n\r\nThe Pope, whose jokes and outbursts alternately supplied gossip, is\r\nreported by Friedrich as saying that Döllinger was a heretic, or very\r\nnear it, and that Günther was much more respectable, as he had been\r\nquiet for a long time (dead). Some one observing to him that Döllinger\r\nwas a harmless old man, he replied, Pretty kind of old man that\r\nreceives addresses from every quarter. He made no secret that he took\r\nthe Opposition bishops generally for \"softheads,\" but thought they\r\nmust have some one behind them. He knew who nodded approval while\r\nStrossmayer spoke, and who pressed his hand when he came down. He said\r\nthat Cardinal Schwarzenberg played the part of the sub-deacon in the\r\nmanger; that is, the part of the ass in the scene of the Nativity.\r\nSchwarzenberg, he said, had been the only person who declared that the\r\ndefinition of the Immaculate Conception would draw bad consequences\r\nafter it. But \"the definition took place on a morning when the sun\r\nshone so wonderfully that I recognized in it the confirmation of my\r\ndesign.\" Much more chat of the same quality is given.\r\n\r\nFriedrich has one short paragraph to the effect that it was confidently\r\nasserted that Veuillot had a seat behind the scenes in the Council\r\nHall. A man deeply initiated in the secrets of the Council did not deny\r\nit (p. 165). If this was the case, it would be curious to compare it\r\nwith M. Veuillot's account of his being on the Pincio, instead of in\r\nthe Cathedral, on the opening day. That meditation in the rain seemed\r\nrather eccentric.\r\n\r\nThe Pope had arranged for an exhibition of Catholic art, and opened it\r\nin person with a speech. The passage which made the greatest impression\r\nwas that in which he alluded to a recent saying of M. de Falloux,\r\na zealous French Catholic politician, and the actual author of the\r\nEducation Bill which embodied Montalembert's policy, to the effect\r\nthat the Church had never had her '89, and she needed one. The Pope\r\ndeclared, \"I say that is blasphemy.\" There were many versions of the\r\nutterance, but M. Veuillot, evidently by authority, stuck to this one.\r\nM. de Falloux, after a considerable time, wrote to Bishop Freppel,\r\nsaying that he had not used the phrase alleged. Bishop Freppel told\r\nthe Pope that M. de Falloux wrote that he had not used it. The Pope\r\nreplied that if M. de Falloux had not used it, he had not condemned M.\r\nde Falloux. There the tale is left by Veuillot (i. p. 360).[332]\r\n\r\nA case like this indicates the struggles between old opinion and the\r\nnew light of unforeseen circumstances, through which many must, at\r\nthis time, have been passing. In the case of Hyacinth and Gratry, the\r\nstruggle had come to the surface; in that of Döllinger, it put on the\r\nsolemnity of age; in that of Montalembert, the awe of death. From the\r\noratory at Birmingham to the chambers of the Quirinal, from under the\r\nroof of the Vatican to lone stations in some mission wild, were men\r\nmoaning with a conscience-ache. The coming on of an eclipse could\r\nhardly be more awful to a meditative Magus than the advancing shadow of\r\nheresy on the Church herself to one who had believed her infallible.\r\nThe dread images of doubt and uncertainty not only haunted, but\r\nthreatened many a brave spirit. If the infallibility of the Church was\r\nto be reduced to the level of that of the Popes, in the doctrines and\r\nmorals they had solemnly taught; to the level, for instance, of Pius IX\r\nand his Syllabus--alas, alas for the great ideas of the past! And was\r\nit so clear that it had been innocent to lay those under anathema who,\r\nlooking away from man to Christ, from Councils to the Bible, had meekly\r\nsaid, The only infallible guide over life's broad sea is not the church\r\nsteeples, but the stars.\r\n\r\nThe veil is partly lifted off from one such struggle. Friedrich's stay\r\nin Rome had been harassing. Suspected of being the correspondent of\r\nthe _Augsburg Gazette_, he had been denounced in the papers, treated\r\nrudely by bishops, jeered at by the Pope, reported as being banished,\r\nand dogged by police spies even in the house of Cardinal Hohenlohe.\r\nAll this would intensify his perception of the moral corruption of\r\nthe city, of which many a priest before him had spoken, from Luther\r\nto Liverani, or Lammenais. It would also give a keener edge to the\r\ntheological debates which were going on in his own mind. After an\r\ninterval of five days in his diary, he writes, under date of February\r\n25 (p. 195)--\r\n\r\n    At last I must once more take up the pen. If the last few days have\r\n    been important for the history of the Council, still more important\r\n    have they been for my own life-history. A mental struggle within\r\n    me has reached its close, one which was hard to undergo, and which\r\n    shook my entire mental and physical being. Now all stands clear\r\n    before my eyes. I know the end toward which I am to steer. The Lord\r\n    has once more led me a stage further in my life-path. It was truly\r\n    a melancholy thought for me when, finding for a moment a point of\r\n    rest in the midst of this struggle, I looked back upon my peculiar\r\n    course. From that decision to become a Jesuit, onwards to this\r\n    journey to Rome, an unseen hand has so perceptibly led me, almost\r\n    always without design of mine, that even here, in the midst of the\r\n    new storms, I have been able to take fresh courage. I stand here in\r\n    Rome only through the unseen guidance of the Lord; for it was not\r\n    I that ever took a step to come here; indeed, all was done without\r\n    me. But I see clearly that even that dispensation was to purify my\r\n    views and intentions, and to lead me on towards the sole prescribed\r\n    end of my life.\r\n\r\n    At one time, how much was Rome for me! How did I, in a sense,\r\n    worship all that came from it! Now I see that here reign not only\r\n    the most horrid ignorance, but, still more, pride, lies, and sin.\r\n    Henceforth my life has its task marked out for two ends. Henceforth\r\n    it is devoted to the struggle against the Curia (not primacy), and\r\n    to that against the Jesuits. If I fall in it, I shall believe that\r\n    the Lord has so willed, and that there can be, and that there is,\r\n    a martyrdom for Christ, and for His Church, among the faithful.\r\n    If I have had to learn here that the Curialists and the Jesuits\r\n    are enemies not less furious than the heathen, I shall openly show\r\n    the world that they do not scruple to devise the death of their\r\n    enemies. The _Univers_ may erroneously write, \"The scandal in Rome\r\n    is great,\" because I am here and am betraying the secrets of Rome;\r\n    but one may say with full right, \"The scandal in Christendom is\r\n    great.\"\r\n\r\nThe bishops of the minority still declared their determination to\r\nresist every attempt to concentrate infallibility in the Pope; but\r\nDarboy said to a diplomatist, What use is it to send in protests that\r\nnever receive an answer?[333] The last protest, however, contained\r\nthe grave matter in which a hundred bishops pledged themselves to\r\nlanguage casting doubt upon the oecumenicity of the Council. Of no\r\nuse for its immediate purpose, that document will always be of real\r\nuse in judging of the value of much that has been said by its signers\r\nsince the Council. Prominent Infallibilists intimated that the dogma\r\nwould not be so defined as to declare the opposite opinion a heresy.\r\nYes, says Friedrich, they would leave it as Trent left the Immaculate\r\nConception--in such a position that some day, when the sun shines fair\r\nupon a Pope, it may be promulged as a dogma. Then he adds, what many\r\nmay have heard stated in Rome, It is strongly asserted that the very\r\nreason why the Council Hall has been placed where it stands, is that\r\nthere at a certain hour the sunbeams fall upon the Papal throne (p.\r\n219).\r\n\r\nVitelleschi says that the visitors to the Exhibition of Church Art\r\ndid not generally exceed the number of the _gendarmes_, and expresses\r\nan opinion that the real Christian arts are better represented in\r\nsuch international exhibitions as might be seen elsewhere. Anything\r\nless like Christianity than many of the objects which in Rome are\r\ncalled objects of Christian art, is hard to conceive, or anything\r\nmore fitted to turn men into triflers, if once they give themselves\r\nup to such baubles as the great concern of life, either social or\r\nreligious. In this exhibition, Friedrich was struck with a statue of\r\nthe Pope defining the Immaculate Conception, and with pictures of the\r\nsame event, \"with the inevitable sunbeams.\" He was also arrested by a\r\ngroup of the Risen Christ, with Pius standing before Him in a flowing\r\npluvial. He says that when one looks at the humble figure of our\r\nLord, and then at the self-conscious Pius, one is inclined to surmise\r\nthat the latter is thinking, \"I am not only what Thou art, but much\r\nmore. I command all; Thou didst serve all\" (p. 220). Quirinus quotes,\r\nwithout translating it, a saying of an Italian noble, which might\r\nhave suggested the very thought: \"Other Popes believed that they were\r\nVicars of Christ; but this Pope believes that our Lord is his Vicar\r\nin heaven\" (p. 326). These are the things which the worshippers of\r\nPius IX call blasphemy, while most Italians smile if you doubt their\r\nlegitimacy. Friedrich tells how the auditor of Cardinal Hohenlohe,\r\nan ecclesiastic, expressed the horror that had been caused in Rome\r\nby Friedrich's articles on Manning in the _Literaturblatt_. He added\r\nthat Hohenlohe would have been a great Cardinal but for two blunders,\r\nthat of visiting Cardinal Andrea when he returned to Rome, and that of\r\nbringing Professor Friedrich to the Council (p. 220).\r\n\r\nThe ministry of Prince Hohenlohe, in Bavaria, had fallen under the\r\nhostile influences of the Church party. On the other hand, the recent\r\naction of France and Austria had shown that possibly the Curia, if not\r\nprompt, might meet with more formidable checks than any that could\r\narise from Bavaria. As to France, the Curia would seem, rightly or\r\nwrongly, to have felt that if Napoleon dared them to the worst, they\r\ncould shake him out of his place, if not as easily, yet as surely as\r\nthe bearers of the Pope's portative throne could upset a Pontiff.\r\nDaru's demands were officially made known by the reluctant, indeed the\r\nall but recalcitrant M. de Banneville, no earlier than March 1. At\r\nthis very time Dupanloup was drawing up, and the French bishops were\r\npreparing to sign, the protest against the new Rules. The adhesion of\r\nthe German and Hungarian bishops to this protest was to be foreseen.\r\nThe Curia, therefore, took the decision to face both Bonapartes and\r\nbishops, and to throw down the gauntlet.\r\n\r\nThe meetings of General Congregations had been suspended to give the\r\nFathers time for study. On the evening of March 7 a short notice was\r\nsent round to their houses, saying that an additional chapter, to be\r\ncalled the Eleventh, would be inserted in the Draft of Decrees on\r\nthe Church. This new chapter was simply that declaration of Papal\r\ninfallibility which had been asked for by the famous Address. So the\r\ndie was cast. All uncertainty as to the designs of the Curia was at\r\nan end. Not only was the dogma to be defined, but all who should deny\r\nit were to be excluded from the unity of the Church. Quirinus says\r\nthat the Pope gave his sanction to this critical act under great\r\npersonal excitement. For four-and-twenty years had he sought the crown\r\nof infallibility, believing himself to be wrongfully deprived of it\r\nby the error and unbelief of mankind. In 1848, when Count Mamiani,\r\nafter ceasing to be the Prime Minister of the new Pontiff, met his\r\nfriends in Florence, he said, \"It is utterly impossible to act as the\r\nconstitutional minister of a Pope who is stark mad on the subject of\r\nhis own personal infallibility.\"[334]\r\n\r\nThe bishops found that they had only ten days allowed them to send in\r\ntheir written comments upon the fundamental change now impending in\r\nthe constitution of the Church, in their creed, and in their standard\r\nof faith. Vitelleschi remarks that the brevity of the time given\r\nwill remain as a testimony to the pressure exercised, and will lower\r\nthe impression of the wisdom of men who hurried the Church through\r\nsuch a transformation.[335] The _Civiltá_ states that the time was\r\nafterwards extended by a week.[336] If it was proposed to give to\r\nOrders of the Queen in Council all the scope and effect of Acts of\r\nParliament, our Lords and Commons would expect at least one week beyond\r\nten days' notice before meeting the Court party in the lists, and more\r\nparticularly if the right of moving that the Bill should be read that\r\nday six months had been for ever snatched away from them.\r\n\r\nA visit of the ex-Grand Duke of Tuscany, or, as the _Civiltá_ takes\r\ncare to call him, the Grand Duke, is formally recorded, as if to show\r\nthe proper relations between princes and the Pontiff. On his arrival,\r\nthe Grand Duke was waited upon by the majordomo and chamberlain of\r\nthe Pope; and next day by Antonelli, as Secretary of State. The day\r\nfollowing, the Grand Duke \"went to the apostolic palace to do homage\r\nto the Holy Father.\" This is the true language of vassalage. To make\r\nit plainer, the Pope, on the same day, \"admitted the Archduke Charles\r\nof Tuscany to an audience.\"[337] It was, however, not encouraging for\r\nthe projectors of \"a new world\" that the only princes who came with\r\nsuitable reverence to the door which formed the entrance to it were\r\nprinces who represented a world that had waxed old, had decayed, and\r\nindeed had vanished away.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 320: _Friedberg_, p. 112.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 321: _Friedberg_, p. 114.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 322: _Friedberg_, p. 138.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 323: _Vitelleschi_, p. 81.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 324: _Quirinus_, p. 267.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 325: _Friedberg_, p. 415; _Acta_, p. 18; Freiburg ed., p.\r\n163.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 326: _Friedrich_, p. 198.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 327: _Doc. ad Ill._, i. 164.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 328: \"_In pluribus Patrum libertas inde minui, imo etiam\r\ntolli posse videatur._\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 329: _Alioquin jam deputatio esset totum concilium et in\r\npluribus solus judex._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 330: _Documenta_, i. p. 263.

Ollivier, said Don Margotti, once stated\r\nthat he loved strong powers with confidence in themselves, and as the\r\nPope always wished to be loved by ministers of Napoleon III, he had\r\nshowed them that he was strong.[338] \"It is a great spectacle, but it\r\nwill be a still greater one when infallibility is proclaimed, and the\r\nSyllabus is proclaimed, in spite of the opposition of governments, of\r\nrevolutions, and of all hell.\"\r\n\r\nBut the speedy closing of the question, now formally opened, was\r\nindispensable. The suggestion of an acclamation on the day of Mary in\r\nDecember had proved vain; but the day of Joseph was now approaching.\r\nThe term allowed for sending in written observations on the Draft would\r\nexpire on March 17, and the _Unitá_, in its number of the 11th, put up\r\nthe following prayer: \"O Blessed St. Joseph, grant us the grace that\r\non the 18th of March may be discussed, and on the 19th, the day of thy\r\nFestival, may be proclaimed, the most pleasant and most wise doctrine\r\nof the infallibility of the Vicar of Jesus Christ.\" The correspondent\r\nof the _Unitá_ from Rome said, \"We hope for the definition on the 19th,\r\nSt. Joseph's Day\"; and its correspondent at Paris stated that no doubt\r\nexisted that the dogma would be proclaimed on that day. Two days before\r\nthe one so anticipated, the _Unitá_ published suggestive accounts of\r\nthe scenes in 1854, when the Immaculate Conception was acclaimed. It\r\nquoted Canon Audisio, a well-known writer, and one sometimes called a\r\nLiberal Catholic. Just after the noontide bell, when the two hundred\r\nbishops had knelt to repeat the Angelus, as soon as they resumed their\r\nseats, a cry speedily broke out from among them, _Petre, doce nos:\r\nconfirma fratres tuos_: (Peter, teach us! strengthen thy brethren!) The\r\nteaching desired was a definition of the Immaculate Conception. The\r\nwhole assembly wept. \"It was a weeping so cordial and sublime that you\r\ncannot imagine it, and pen cannot describe it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this hint, as to what the scene--always a chief point--on the\r\n19th should be, the principles of polity involved in the scene are\r\nindicated; for in Rome all acting is for the purpose of ruling. Some\r\nprelates, said the _Araldo di Lucca_, as quoted by the _Unitá_, had\r\nthought that the Bull announcing the dogma of the Immaculate Conception\r\nshould make mention of the assembly of the bishops; but a prelate from\r\nFrance, rising _in the spirit of Athanasius_, said, \"No; the episcopate\r\nshould not decide, but only the chief Pontiff; he alone must speak.\"\r\nHe went on to argue that, by showing obedience to the Pontiff, they\r\nwould secure the obedience of the people, and strengthen the principle\r\nof authority. The _Unitá_ significantly adds, \"It appears to us, and\r\nit will appear to all, that not only the dogma of the Immaculate was\r\ndefined on that memorable sitting of the 24th of November, 1854, but\r\nalso that of Papal infallibility.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the party of movement was full of hope, the minority were in\r\ndismay. Their chosen ground of inopportuneness had been cut from under\r\ntheir feet. The Pope and five hundred bishops had decided that the\r\nquestion was opportune. They now felt that if the dogma should be\r\nsuddenly defined, they must either submit or be outside of the Church.\r\nThe new Rules permitted the discussion to be closed at the will of\r\nthe majority. It was notorious that any discussion whatever, on a\r\npoint so immediately affecting the authority of the Pope, not only in\r\nthe Church, but also in the world, was hateful to every right-minded\r\nCurialist, and, in fact, that as taking place hard by the tomb of St.\r\nPeter, such a discussion was regarded as a thing all but intolerable.\r\nThe suggestions in the _Unitá_ from Rome, Paris, and Turin had not been\r\nput out without high sanction. Was it possible that, on St. Joseph's\r\nDay, all would be ended by an irresistible acclamation?\r\n\r\nSome think that so deep a feeling was now produced in the minority,\r\nand that so clear did they make it that they would not acquiesce in\r\nan acclamation, that they impressed the Vatican for a time. Friedrich\r\nrepeats, on the authority of one who was intimate with the Pope, a\r\nsaying of the latter, \"The Jesuits have set me on this road, and now I\r\nshall go on in it, and they must bear the responsibility.\" The personal\r\nposition of members of the minority became more and more trying, owing\r\nto the increasingly active part taken by the Pontiff in the discussion.\r\nA second brief to the Jesuit Ramière[339] followed the one which\r\nridiculed Maret, commending another publication of the same author,\r\nin which, alluding to the possibility that some now opposing the\r\ninfallibility of the Pope would secede from the Church, Ramière said,\r\n\"These form the secret enemy who impedes our march, and, in driving him\r\nfrom our ranks, the sacred army will obtain the most precious guarantee\r\nof its future success.\"[340] Friedrich adds, what agrees with much that\r\nis said, or hinted, by other Liberal Catholics, strange as it sounds in\r\nour ears, \"Any one who knows the Jesuits can explain the closing words\r\nof the pamphlet, 'Then, truly will the Council have realized the most\r\nardent desire of the Saviour, and established the conditions on which\r\nthis divine Master makes the submission of the entire world to the yoke\r\nof the faith depend.'\"\r\n\r\n    \"That is,\" explains Friedrich, \"the yoke of the Society of Jesus;\r\n    for even under the name Jesus, 'we are only to understand the\r\n    Society of Jesu.' At the Festival of St. Ignatius Loyola, priests\r\n    must repeat the words, with great emphasis, 'At the name of Jesu\r\n    every knee shall bow.' The former Confessor of the Pope, now\r\n    replaced by a Jesuit, always felt scandalized by this, on the eve\r\n    of the Festival, and earnestly wished to have those words removed\r\n    from the Mass for Loyola's Day.\"\r\n\r\nArchbishop Cardoni, being asked what had become of the Draft Decrees\r\non Faith, said that the committee first examined them, after which\r\nDeschamps, Pie, and Martin, as a sub-committee, partly prepared\r\na revised form, and finally the recasting of them was completed\r\nby Kleutgen, the Jesuit. What, it was asked, the Kleutgen who was\r\ncondemned by the Inquisition? Yes, replied the Archbishop faintly.\r\nThis Kleutgen had been a German political refugee, but joined the\r\nJesuits, and became confessor to a nunnery. One of the nuns, a\r\nGerman princess, was dying. Her relations, through interest with the\r\nPope, succeeded in procuring her release. It proved to be a case of\r\npoisoning. The Inquisitors took proceedings, and Kleutgen was somehow\r\nincriminated. The convent was closed, the nuns were dispersed into\r\nother establishments, and the confessor was sentenced to prison for six\r\nyears. The imprisonment was changed into reclusion in one of the Jesuit\r\nhouses, in a delightful neighbourhood near Rome. Kleutgen found means\r\nto regain favour, and was now remoulding the faith for the benefit of\r\nreconstituted society.[341]\r\n\r\nCardoni told how he, an Archbishop, had been received the preceding day\r\nby the Pope before Schwarzenberg, a Cardinal and a prince, and it was\r\nadded that Schwarzenberg had been obliged to wait a fortnight for his\r\naudience, whereas a Cardinal was entitled to have one after two days.\r\nCardinal De Angelis alleged that the Pope had seen Schwarzenberg behind\r\nthe Vatican smoking a cigar, with a \"small hat\" on his head. To this\r\nthe Germans replied that it was well known that Schwarzenberg did not\r\nsmoke.[342] We cannot state what would be the penalty for a Cardinal\r\nconvicted of wearing a small hat, but they are a class of \"creatures\"\r\nwhose eternal salvation may, by the will of their lord, be declared to\r\ndepend on matters the connexion of which with the Christian religion\r\nit takes a Pontiff to find out. Sixtus V decreed the penalty of\r\nexcommunication against any Cardinal who should open a letter bearing\r\nthe plain address \"Cardinal,\" without the title \"Most Illustrious and\r\nMost Reverend.\" They were to burn such letters. (_Frond_, ii., p. xiii.)\r\n\r\nArchbishop Ledochowski, whose name has frequently been heard of since\r\nthe Council, had been made Primate of Poland by the Pope. This office,\r\nin olden time, carried with it the regency of the country, in the\r\ninterregnum between the death of one king and the election of another.\r\nAs primate, the Archbishop put on the colours of a Cardinal. Count\r\nL---- told Friedrich that Ledochowski had said that he was right glad\r\nthat he had so early joined the Infallibilists, for Rome was certain\r\nto carry through what she had taken in hand, and therefore the bishops\r\nof the Opposition would gradually come over to the right side, and\r\nwould cut a poor figure at the last. Count L---- expressed himself as\r\nindignant at this morality. But, said Friedrich, scarcely had the Count\r\nended, when I read in the _Univers_ that Ledochowski was mentioned\r\nfor promotion as a Cardinal. We may here, as illustrating the bearing\r\nof titles and colours on very serious affairs, interject a statement\r\nof what happened later.[343] Ledochowski, after the Council, at once\r\ntook up a new position. When the German bishops next met at Fulda, he\r\nwould not join them. As Primate of Poland, he said, he belonged to the\r\ntomb of St. Adelbert rather than to that of St. Boniface. He would\r\nno longer admit Germans to his seminary for priests. In places where\r\npreaching had existed alternately in German and Polish, he suppressed\r\nthe German. His organ, the _Tyotnick_, related how, during the Council,\r\nthe Pope had given him the title of Primate of Poland, but denied that\r\nhe _used_ the political powers attached to the title. Nevertheless, the\r\n_Catholic Calendar_ for 1872, published in Thorn, placed the name of\r\nLedochowski in the list of reigning princes, as Primate of Poland and\r\nrepresentative of the King of Poland. So that, if the powers attached\r\nto the title were not used, the reasons were not far to seek.[344]\r\n\r\nWhile early converts were joyful, Ketteler continued to be mysterious.\r\nIn a meeting of German prelates he declared that, though all his life\r\nhe had worked for infallibility, he could not do so now. This Draft\r\nDecree was a crime. But what was to be done? Send in another protest?\r\nAll cried out at once, No! no! they have treated us like domestics, and\r\nnot even given us an answer.[345]\r\n\r\nOn February 27 Don Margotti had said that even a Protestant or a\r\nMohammedan, a Schismatic or a Jew, would see from the new Rules that no\r\nassembly could be freer. Döllinger, on the other hand, had published a\r\nletter on the new Rules. He took the ground indicated in the protest\r\nof the one hundred bishops. In matters of faith, as he contended, the\r\nRules shifted the source of authority from tradition to majority. This\r\nhe showed to be a direct departure from the doctrine of the Catholic\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nThe days which some had fixed upon for the triumph of an acclamation\r\nwere passed in excitement of a different kind. A letter appeared in\r\nthe _Gazette de France_ and the _Times_, from Montalembert, addressed\r\nto some gentleman who had challenged his present opposition as\r\ninconsistent with his former championship of the Church. The dying\r\nman then delivered his last public utterance. He protested that, in\r\nhis early days, the pretensions now put forth were unheard of. In\r\nlanguage already cited he described the incredible change of the clergy\r\nafter 1850, and their present shortsighted prostration before the idol\r\nthey had set up. He showed that in his speech of 1847 there was not a\r\nword of the doctrine of Papal infallibility. He might have indicated\r\nalso the still more celebrated speech on the restoration of Pius IX.\r\nHe quoted that remarkable letter of Sibour, Archbishop of Paris, in\r\nwhich he depicted the difference between the old Ultramontanism and\r\nthe new. Montalembert then declared that his whole regret was that\r\nillness prevented him from descending into the arena to join Dupanloup\r\nand Gratry, to contend on his own ground, that of history and of\r\nsocial consequences. \"Then should I merit--and it is my sole remaining\r\nambition--a share in the _litanies of insult_ daily launched against\r\nmy illustrious friends by a portion, too numerous, of the clergy--that\r\npoor clergy which is preparing for itself so sad a destiny, and which\r\nformerly I loved, defended, and honoured, as no one in modern France\r\nhad done.\" The _Unitá_ cried, \"Better for Montalembert had he died\r\na year ago; better indeed had he never been born.\"[346] While these\r\nwords were ringing in the ears of all, came a telegram announcing\r\nthat Montalembert was no more. That evening the Pope had one of those\r\naudiences in which he delights; a kind of public meeting, with three\r\nhundred persons present. Of course every one expected that the little\r\nmember which in the days of Pius IX has done much to make the Pope an\r\nentertainment for Italians, would not be able to keep off the exciting\r\ntopic. \"A Catholic has just died,\" said his Holiness, \"who rendered\r\nservices to the Church. He wrote a letter which I have read. I know not\r\nwhat he said at the moment of death; but I know one thing--that man\r\nhad a great enemy, pride. He was a Liberal Catholic--that is to say, a\r\nhalf-Catholic.... Yes, Liberal Catholics are half-Catholics.\"[347]\r\n\r\nAbout the time when the Pope was thus speaking of him whose eloquence\r\nhad been worth regiments to him, Father Combalot was crying from the\r\npulpit of Notre Dame Della Valle--\r\n\r\n    \"Satan has entered into Judas! There are men who were Christians,\r\n    and who on the brink of the grave become enemies of the Pope, and\r\n    speak of torrents of adulation, and accuse us of erecting him into\r\n    an idol. To speak so is Satanic work. There are three academicians\r\n    who do it\" [Montalembert, Gratry, and Dupanloup].[348]\r\n\r\nArchbishop De Mérode, brother-in-law of Montalembert, and almoner\r\nto the Pope, arranged that a High Mass should be celebrated in the\r\nAracoeli on the height of the Capitoline, that is, the church of the\r\nRoman municipality, in which Montalembert was entitled to the honour\r\nof such a solemnity because of the dignity of Roman citizen which had\r\nbeen conferred upon him for his distinguished services to the Church.\r\nOn the 16th a notice was circulated, announcing the intended Mass, in\r\npublishing which the _Univers_ stated that it was known that there\r\nwould be no oration--a record which spoiled subsequent fables. Late\r\nthat evening, in the great church of the French, a preacher dwelt upon\r\nthe memory of Montalembert, inviting the audience to the solemn service\r\nat the Capitoline the next morning. At the same time the rooms of\r\nArchbishop Darboy were crowded. French prelates related what remarks\r\nthey had written on the proposal for infallibility. Each one beheld\r\nin his own a great and heroic act. Landriot, Archbishop of Rheims,\r\nhad employed a quotation from Bessarion against the curial system,\r\nand expected to be called Jansenist, Gallican, Febronian, and such\r\nlike. Friedrich, we suspect, was making prelates understand that if\r\nonce they allowed themselves to recommence deliberation under the new\r\nRules, all hope of successful opposition would be idle, and hinting his\r\nbelief that under such Rules the Council had no proper oecumenicity.\r\nSuddenly news came from Mérode. Something was wrong. It proved that\r\nthe High Mass for Montalembert had been forbidden by the Pontiff.\r\nWhat! the departed spirit of the foremost Frenchman in the chivalry\r\nof the Church to be insulted on the Capitoline by the Pope in person!\r\nAmong all those Frenchmen, many were old enough to remember the most\r\nbrilliant of Montalembert's sallies, and all were old enough to have\r\nwitnessed the public disgust when a Court chamberlain turned him out at\r\nthe election of 1857, half of the clergy voting against him, and the\r\nother half staying at home. But this beat all. A Cardinal present could\r\nnot restrain the confession, \"Now I am well ashamed of being a Roman\r\nCardinal.\"[349]\r\n\r\nThe announcement was too late to reach all, and when the hour for\r\nthe service came, some twenty bishops and many French notables\r\nassembled. Father Beckx, the General of the Jesuits, had come from the\r\nneighbouring _Gesù_, thinking, doubtless, of the splendid services to\r\nthe Order which had been rendered by the confiding genius of the man\r\nfor whose soul he was now to pray. Even Louis Veuillot came, trying\r\nto forget the irritations of recent years, perhaps hoping in part to\r\nmake reparation for ingratitude and insolence, and unable now to see\r\nthe opponent, seeing only as in old days the \"son of the Crusaders,\"\r\nfacing, provoking, and dominating a hostile Parliament, with his\r\nhead back and his blue eye flashing, till at some turning-point in\r\nhis theme the fountains of a great deep broke up, the deep of his\r\nmighty emotions, and then gushed out a flood which carried all before\r\nit. When they reached the steps of the Aracoeli, an official, who\r\nwas one of the subordinates of Mérode, cried out in a French phrase\r\nwhich he had learned on purpose, that they must go away, that the\r\nMass was forbidden. It is evident that they were all overcome with\r\nmortification, not to use stronger language. Even M. Veuillot pushed by\r\nand said, \"It can do no harm to repeat some paternosters for him.\"[350]\r\n\r\nQuirinus says that probably it was De Banneville who represented to\r\nthe Pope the serious effects that would be produced in France by this\r\nproceeding. So, on the evening of the 17th, instead of arranging\r\nfor the acclamation of infallibility, the Pope was making the small\r\namends of sending a private message to have a Mass celebrated, on\r\nthe following morning, on behalf of a certain deceased Charles, in\r\nthe Church of Santa Maria Traspontina. No public notice whatever was\r\ngiven of this service. The bishops were all shut up in a General\r\nCongregation. The Pope went privately, without any suite, sat hidden\r\nin a latticed \"tribune,\" and then had it announced to the world that\r\nhe had personally attended a Mass on behalf of Montalembert. When the\r\nexceedingly painful feeling he had caused began to appear, an attempt\r\nwas made to turn the occasion to account by throwing the blame on\r\nDupanloup. It was declared that it had been announced that he would\r\ndeliver an oration, and indeed that the proposed function had been got\r\nup by him as a party demonstration. This gave Dupanloup the opportunity\r\nof writing[351]:--\r\n\r\n    This is an outrage at once upon the Holy Father, Monsignor De\r\n    Mérode, the bishops, and myself. This entire tale, Sir, is false\r\n    from the first word to the last. I did not appoint the service.\r\n    I was not to officiate. I have had nothing whatever to do in\r\n    distributing cards of invitation. Whatever may have been my\r\n    profound and inviolable affection for M. De Montalembert, it\r\n    belonged to the members of his family present in Rome, Monsignor\r\n    De Mérode and the Count De Mérode, and not to me, to arrange the\r\n    details of this religious ceremony. It is within my knowledge that\r\n    in doing so they conformed to all the laws and formalities usual in\r\n    Rome in similar cases.\r\n\r\nThe last statement was made to upset one of the excuses, that proper\r\nleave had not been asked for the service. So those false stories, at\r\nleast, were stayed.\r\n\r\nAs the news spread in succession from place to place, the imaginations\r\nof Liberal Catholics all over Europe would restlessly wander up and\r\ndown the Capitoline, seeing on that historical slope the signal given\r\nfor their eternal disgrace in the Holy City. It was given too by an\r\narrow shot from the Pontiff's own bow, and aimed at the shade of\r\nMontalembert. We do not profess to know what injury the imagination\r\nof such men might picture as having been done to the spirit that was\r\ngone, but those Christians who believe in a God who, not even in this\r\nworld, much less in the great hereafter, trusts any child of man,\r\nthough the least of all the little ones, to a Vicar--those who believe\r\nin a sacrifice which no man can repeat, prohibit, or buy, when they\r\nheard what had occurred, saw the spirit pass into the true temple,\r\n_and outfly all the arrows of death_. Oh, how benign is that light of\r\nimmortality which shows us the spirits of the departed resting in the\r\nhands of their Father, altogether above dependence on the malice or the\r\ncompassion, on the liberality or the avarice, on the devotion or the\r\nunbelief of living men; and which, with the same blessed beam, shows us\r\nthe living protected from all possible malice, raised into independence\r\nof all possible goodwill of the dead, by a near and solicitous paternal\r\nWatcher. All the traffic of the markets of Purgatory, a traffic as low\r\nand demoralizing as any traffic can be, scarcely exposes the system\r\nwhich has sprung up around that invention so much as one broil like\r\nthat which the traffickers raised around the soul of Montalembert--no,\r\nnot around his soul, that was beyond their reach, only around his\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 338: _Unitá Cattolica_, March 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 339: _Friedberg_, p. 491.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 340: _Tagebuch_, p. 221.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 341: _Tagebuch_, p. 230.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 342: _Ibid._, p. 231.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 343: Menzel, _Jesuitenumtriebe_, p. 297.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 344: The following passage in the speech made to the Pope\r\nby Ledochowski on his elevation to the purple, is taken from the\r\n_Emancipatore Cattolico_, April 22, 1876:--\"And as the persecution\r\nwas most bitter in that part of Poland which is now under Prussian\r\noccupation ... the honour of this sacred purple falls like a celestial\r\ndew upon my oppressed and agonised country, and seems silently to say\r\nto her, that if forgotten and abandoned of the world, she is still\r\nloved and blessed by God, of whom your Holiness is the Vicar.\" The very\r\nnext paragraph in the same paper is headed, _The Heresy of Love of\r\nCountry_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 345: _Tagebuch_, p. 236.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 346: March 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 347: This is the version quoted from the _Moniteur Universel_\r\nin _Ce Qui se Passe au Concile_, p. 154.

The step so spoken of was a simple one. Four\r\nAmerican prelates sent in a declaration that if any attempt was made to\r\ncarry infallibility by acclamation, as had been suggested, they would\r\nleave the Council, go home, and publish their reasons for so doing.\r\n\r\nWhether this proceeding alone, or this together with other indications,\r\ninfluenced the majority, certain it is that when the General\r\nCongregations were resumed, on March 18, there was no acclamation. St.\r\nJoseph did not avail more for his day than the Immaculate had done for\r\nhers. All that we hear of any attempt to provoke an acclamation is the\r\nstatement of Vitelleschi that one prelate tried to get infallibility\r\ncarried \"by chance,\" but received countenance only from very few. The\r\nminority gave in their protest against the new Rules to the Presiding\r\nCardinals. We need not say that neither then nor at any later time did\r\nthey receive an answer. The business now placed before the Fathers was\r\nthe Draft of Decrees on Dogma as revised. The eighteen chapters had,\r\nunder the hands of the committee, the sub-committee, and Kleutgen,\r\nshrunk to four. Even as they now stood, the chapters had to undergo\r\nconsiderable alteration before taking the shape in which they appear\r\nupon the _Acta_. As they stand there, they are not at first sight\r\ncapable of interesting the theologian for their theology, or the\r\npolitician for their bearing on politics. At the time, they led many to\r\nwonder why grave men should have spent years in formulating rudimentary\r\nprinciples, and that not very successfully. The alleged reason was\r\nthat everything being wrong in the ideas of the age, the Church must\r\ncommence by asserting the existence of a God, and the fact that He had\r\ncreated the world. An attempt was made to throw some dignity about\r\nthis proceeding by quoting a prophecy of some saint, to the effect\r\nthat an age would come when a General Council would have to do this.\r\nOn the other hand, as Vitelleschi shows, Roman wit said that really,\r\nafter sitting four months and a half, the Vatican Council would vote\r\nalmost unanimously that God created the world. Friedrich, however, saw\r\nthat the Curial system was insinuated in these Decrees, but it took a\r\ntheologian to discern it, and one who was not a mere theologian. Yet\r\nwhen it was pointed out there could be no doubt of the fact. The simple\r\nheadings, \"God, the Creator of the World,\" \"Revelation,\" \"Faith,\"\r\nand \"Faith and Reason,\" would to Protestant eyes seem very unlikely\r\nto cover any such purpose. Nevertheless, they are made to serve the\r\npurpose of laying a foundation for the dominion of the Church, over\r\nall science and knowledge, for the dominion of the Pope, ay, even that\r\nof the Roman Congregations, over the Church, and for the lifting of\r\nmen out of civil control into the higher sphere of Christian liberty,\r\nor, as the world would call it, for placing them under the dominion\r\nof ecclesiastical law. The process by which this is done is simple,\r\nand had been clearly indicated in the officious expositions of those\r\njudgments of the Syllabus which condemned \"naturalism.\" First, God,\r\nas a personal Being, exists, has created the world, and rules it.\r\nSecondly, He gives a revelation by which man is raised above natural\r\nknowledge and perfection to a higher knowledge and perfection. Thirdly,\r\nthis revelation is a deposit committed to the Church, which holds in\r\ncharge the Word of God, _written and traditional_; and all things\r\nare to be believed which she propounds as divinely revealed, whether\r\nthey are propounded by solemn judgment, or by the ordinary teaching\r\nauthority. Hence, naturally, all science must be held subject to this\r\nfaith, and therefore subject to this Church; and _all things condemned\r\nin the Decrees of the Holy See_ are to be held as anathema, even though\r\nnot specified in the present Decrees.\r\n\r\nThe four chapters containing these principles would not fix the\r\nattention of any student if he took them up in a village of the\r\nCampagna or of Connaught as the work of the priest of the parish. He\r\nwould be tempted to doubt whether the worthy man who faced Atheism and\r\nPantheism with these weapons had ever really met with them face to\r\nface in either their ancient or modern forms. He might even be tempted\r\nto think that the intellectual life of the author had been passed\r\nwithin walls, and that so far as concerns the books and the minds\r\nwhich really sway contemporary thought in either of the directions\r\nindicated, he had scarcely ever felt their grip. But when we look at\r\nthis document as the work of a great society, on the preparation of\r\nwhich had been employed the leisure of years by a few, and then the\r\nunited counsels of a large yet elect number, it certainly does not\r\nexalt our idea of human gifts. But it is not well to let the critical\r\ncontempt which German scholars especially have displayed for the Drafts\r\nwhile under discussion, and for the Decrees when ultimately framed,\r\nblind us to the practical success of this late but adroit creed. For\r\nthe purpose of laying a colourable theological basis under a municipal\r\narrangement for governing mind and knowledge, belief and morals, laws\r\nand institutions all over the world, by a college of Augurs called\r\nChristian priests, it was not a mere superfluity of the professors,\r\nas many seemed to think. Sambin, Guérin, and other writers, not to\r\nmention prelates in abundance, struck a note, which is now taken up in\r\ncolleges, seminaries, and schools. These compact chapters, being once\r\nexalted to the level of the Word of God, formed a short and easy method\r\nfor connecting the Creator and the creation of the world with the last\r\nedict of the Vatican.\r\n\r\nOne of the startling statements in the secret memorandum, _La Liberté\r\ndu Concile_, touches this Decree. A conclusion to it was proposed which\r\nto many appeared to include infallibility. This was strongly opposed.\r\nThe committee withdrew it, saying that it would be reserved to the end\r\nof the final chapter on Faith. This step was applauded. The next day,\r\nor the next but one, however, the reporter announced that the vote upon\r\nit would be taken then and there. Eighty-three, in voting, demanded\r\nmodifications; which, according to the Rules, compelled a consideration\r\nby the committee of the amendments they proposed. The committee finally\r\nresolved, with one dissentient, to substitute a new wording which would\r\nsatisfy all. But when the moment came to vote, before the reporter\r\nmounted the pulpit, a communication was put into his hands. This\r\nattracted the attention of the Fathers. He mounted the pulpit, but did\r\nnot report what the committee had adopted! He did report what it had\r\nset aside! The vote was instantly called for--no one could speak, the\r\nRules did not allow it. The majority did its duty; and the wording,\r\nsurreptitiously reported, was made \"of Faith.\"[352]\r\n\r\nStrong and circumstantial confirmation of this incredible statement is\r\ngiven in Kenrick's unspoken speech.[353] Incidentally he says, \"The\r\nreporter, while we wondered what was the matter, suddenly recommended\r\nthis conclusion, which had been first submitted and then withdrawn.\"\r\nThis he says only on his way to tell Archbishop Manning that if the\r\nsense put by him upon this famous conclusion was the true one, the\r\nreporter was either himself deceived or had, knowingly, deceived the\r\nbishops. Deceiver or deceived, his declaration had won many votes.\r\nTo get the clause passed, the reporter said it taught no doctrine,\r\nand was only a conclusion to round off the chapters. But when once\r\npassed, Manning cited it as concluding the question of infallibility,\r\nand making it improper for the bishops to discuss that question any\r\nlonger.[354] Kenrick confesses that at the time he feared a trap.\r\nThe writer of _La Liberté du Concile_ declares that if the liberty\r\nof the Council was doubtful, this incident proved the liberty of the\r\ncommittees to be more doubtful still.\r\n\r\nThe sitting was opened with evident anxiety on both sides. The minority\r\nfeared the threatened attempt at acclamation; the majority feared that\r\nthe minority would formally refuse to enter on deliberation under\r\nthe new Rules. When, however, instead of action, the paper protest\r\nwas given in, and the reporter for the committee, Simor, Primate of\r\nHungary, had mounted the pulpit, and things had resumed their course,\r\nthe majority were evidently relieved. They knew that the minority had\r\nnow committed themselves to the new Rules; and that, however they\r\nmight recalcitrate hereafter, they would no more be able to shake off\r\nthe meshes of the net than they had been in the past to shake off\r\nthose of the old Rules. Five speakers had inscribed their names. They\r\nwere supporters of the committee. It proved that the acoustics of the\r\nHall had really been improved by a boarded partition which had been\r\nsubstituted for the curtain. When three had spoken the bell of the\r\nPresident rang, and the speaker then in possession was stopped. The\r\nPope was descending to view the sacred relics, and the Fathers had to\r\nbreak up to form a procession in his train. Not one of them had been\r\ncalled to swell that train in the morning when he went, not to see and\r\nto be seen, but to the mass for \"a certain Charles.\" At the close of\r\nthis anxious sitting Bishop Pie congratulated Cardinal Bilio, \"It has\r\ngone off well.\" So it had; the minority were now fairly enclosed in the\r\nnet.\r\n\r\nM. Veuillot cries, \"There are three great devotions in Rome: the Holy\r\nSacrament, the Holy Virgin, and the Pope. Rome is the city of the Real\r\nPresence, and the city of the Mother of God, and the city of the Vicar\r\nof Jesus Christ.\"[355] That saying sheds a clear light on the effect\r\nof materializing and localizing the idea of the _divine presence_ by\r\nsuch notions as that of transubstantiation. The show of constitutional\r\nreforms just then being made in Paris by Napoleon III, contrasting\r\nas it did with what was being done in Rome, naturally disgusted M.\r\nVeuillot. He said that the title of Emperor now seemed grotesque. It\r\nwas sad to witness the crown turned into a curiosity of the museum,\r\nor an accessory of the theatre. This was his idea of a constitutional\r\ncrown. He consoled himself, however, by the thought that the tiara\r\nremained to us. Happily it was more solid than the crown. Pius IX.,\r\nhe said, would bequeath it to his successor more brilliant and more\r\nindestructible. Scandal of the world! kingdoms everywhere and no kings!\r\nHere is a king, but no kingdom! Let Liberals come to the Vatican and\r\nattempt to take liberties with the constitution. Let even universal\r\nsuffrage attempt it; let it try to make any change here in which the\r\nguardian of the constitution does not concur.[356]\r\n\r\nThe noisy sitting of March 22 has had its echoes all over the world.\r\nThe contradictions given by inspired writers to the uninspired ones\r\nappear to be even less definite than usual. We may content ourselves\r\nwith giving that of Cardinal Manning as the sum of them all:--\r\n\r\n    Having from my earliest remembrance been a witness of public\r\n    assemblies of all kinds, and especially of those among ourselves,\r\n    which for gravity and dignity are supposed to exceed all others,\r\n    I am able and bound to say that I have never seen such calmness,\r\n    self-respect, mutual forbearance, courtesy, and self-control, as\r\n    in the eighty-nine sessions of the Vatican Council. In a period\r\n    of nine months the Cardinal President was compelled to recall\r\n    the speakers to order perhaps twelve or fourteen times. In any\r\n    other assembly they would have been inexorably recalled to the\r\n    question sevenfold oftener and sooner. Nothing could exceed the\r\n    consideration and respect with which this duty was discharged.\r\n    Occasionally murmurs of dissent were audible; now and then a\r\n    comment may have been made aloud. In a very few instances, and\r\n    those happily of an exceptional kind, expressions of strong\r\n    disapproval and of exhausted patience at length escaped. But the\r\n    descriptions of violence, outcries, menace, denunciation, and even\r\n    of personal collisions, with which certain newspapers deceived the\r\n    world, I can affirm to be calumnious falsehoods, fabricated to\r\n    bring the Council into odium and contempt.[357]\r\n\r\n_La Liberté du Concile_ confirms that portion of this statement which\r\nsays that the speakers were often allowed to deliver irrelevant matter,\r\nwhen, in other assemblies, they would have been called back to the\r\nquestion. It says that no bishop of the majority could be named who was\r\never interrupted, although some of them strayed from the question so\r\nfar that, in the first stages of the proceedings, they rushed into the\r\nquestion of infallibility.[358]\r\n\r\nThe first speaker in the celebrated sitting of March 22, was\r\nSchwarzenberg. He was not favourable to the Curia, their proceedings,\r\nor their plans. He had not felt an impression in the Congregations\r\nas if a Council was being held. At last the terrible bell was heard.\r\nIt was faint, but it was certainly sounding. What! a Cardinal rung\r\ndown?--and Schwarzenberg, with his princely rank, his historical name,\r\nhis age, and his majestic presence! Even among the Cardinals, it is\r\nsaid, there was a slight murmur--a greater one among the bishops.\r\nBut Schwarzenberg himself heard bravos for the President.[359] But\r\nthe stately old man held his own.[360] After two other prelates had\r\nsucceeded to the precarious honour in which the Prince Cardinal had\r\nbeen challenged, Strossmayer mounted the pulpit.\r\n\r\nHe attacked the statement contained in the Draft Decrees, that\r\nProtestantism was the source of the several forms of unbelief specified\r\nin that Draft. Strossmayer showed that the worst revolutions and the\r\nworst outbursts of infidelity had not been in Protestant countries,\r\nand that Catholics had not produced better refutations of atheism,\r\npantheism, and materialism than had Protestants, while all were\r\nindebted to such men as Leibnitz and Guizot. The Senior President,\r\nCardinal De Angelis, cried, \"This is not a place to praise the\r\nProtestants\"; and having got so far in Latin, he declined into some\r\nother tongue.[361] No, says Quirinus, it was not the place, being\r\nwithin some few hundred paces of the Inquisition. The excitement had\r\nnow become great. Strossmayer proceeded, amid partial clapping of\r\nhands and general murmurs of disapproval, to demand how they meant to\r\napply the principles embodied in the new Rules, of making a dogma by\r\na majority. When he cried \"That alone can be imposed on the faithful\r\nwhich has in its favour a moral unanimity of bishops,\" up rose Cardinal\r\nCapalti, rang the bell, and, in a voice anything but courteous, as\r\nVitelleschi says, ordered the speaker to stop. Strossmayer replied that\r\nhe was tired of being called to order, and of being thwarted at every\r\npoint; that such proceedings were incompatible with freedom of debate,\r\nand that he protested.[362] Then burst out an uproar that alarmed all\r\nwho were outside in the church. Strossmayer stood, lifted up his hands,\r\nand thrice cried solemnly, \"I protest! I protest! I protest!\" Some one\r\nshouted, \"You protest against us, and we protest against you.\" As the\r\nArchbishops of Rheims afterwards related, one of the majority stood up\r\nand shouted to Strossmayer, \"We all condemn thee!\" Bishop Place, of\r\nMarseilles, cried, \"I do not condemn thee.\" Some one called Strossmayer\r\na cursed heretic. Some shook their fists, some crowded round the\r\npulpit, some cried \"Pius IX. for ever!\" some cried, \"The Cardinal\r\nLegates for ever!\" and others, as Vitelleschi adds, made noises equally\r\nserious and serene. _La Liberté du Concile_ speaks of the unheard of\r\nviolence, of the cries which rang through the basilica outside, and of\r\nthe menaces of a large number who rushed to the tribunal and surrounded\r\nit.[363] Friedrich speaks of clenched fists, and of fears lest the\r\nprelates should tear one another's hair.\r\n\r\nThe people in the church interpreted the commotion each man according\r\nto his own mind. Some--and that wild interpretation is laid to the door\r\nof the English--thought the Garibaldians had attacked the Fathers;\r\nsome, that the long looked for dogma had at last sprung, full armed,\r\nout of the head of the assembly, and that all the uproar was caused by\r\nalarm at the portent. These raised cries of \"Long live the Infallible\r\nPope!\" The crowd pressed round the door of the Hall, and there was\r\ndanger of a tumult in the church. The servants of the bishops tried to\r\nenter the Council Chamber, fearing that their masters were being harmed\r\nin the disturbance. But the _gendarme_, whom Vitelleschi calls the most\r\neffective instrument of every sort of infallibility, cleared off the\r\nthrong, resisted only by the servants, who clung to the door in the\r\nhope of rescuing their masters.\r\n\r\nAn American bishop said, with some patriotic pride, \"Now I know of an\r\nassembly rougher than our own Congress.\"[364] Archbishop Landriot, of\r\nRheims, said he was quite in despair.[365] Even Ketteler said, \"It is\r\ntoo bad, the way they handle us here. I do not know how we shall go\r\nback to our dioceses and exist there.\"[366] Namszanowski, the Prussian\r\nmilitary bishop, said to Friedrich that he had told an Italian prelate,\r\n\"Things are more respectably done with us in a meeting of shoemakers,\r\nthan here in the Council.\" Going on to express his impression that the\r\nonly hope for the Church was in the fall of the temporal power, and the\r\nassumption of control over patronage and Church affairs by a temporal\r\ngovernment, which would get rid of the excessive number of clergy, he\r\ncontinued, \"The most humiliating thing for us German bishops is, that\r\nhere we are forced to learn that it is the Freemason and Liberal papers\r\nthat are correct, and that our Catholic ones, if we must call them\r\nCatholic, _lie_, LIE.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pontiff soon made his voice heard as to the scene of this loud\r\nresounding Tuesday. On the following Friday he had the missionary\r\nbishops, numbering a hundred, assembled in the Sala Regia. There the\r\npictures of St. Bartholomew, of Barbarossa, and of the League against\r\nthe Turks, had time to suggest hopes of future triumph before the\r\nPontiff made his appearance. No sooner had he done so, than all fell on\r\ntheir knees. He had gathered them for a practical purpose. The Dorcases\r\nof the Church had been making, not coats and aprons for the widows,\r\nbut raiment rich and rare for the prelates, and costly attire for\r\naltars and images. It was to distribute these goodly garments that his\r\nHoliness had now convoked them, but, of course, the great thing was the\r\nspeech. Pointing clearly to the Opposition, he said, \"We are surrounded\r\nby great difficulties, for some, like Pilate when terrified by the\r\nJews, are afraid to do right. They fear the revolution. Though knowing\r\nthe truth, they sacrifice all to Cæsar, even the rights of the Holy\r\nSee, and their attachment to the Vicar of Jesus Christ. Wretches! what\r\na fault they commit! The warfare of bishops,\" he went on to say, \"is to\r\ndefend the truth with the Vicar of Christ. My children, do not forsake\r\nme. Attach yourselves to me. Be with me. Unite yourselves to the Vicar\r\nof Jesus Christ.\"\r\n\r\nWe follow the version of M. Veuillot (vol. i. p. 372). Vitelleschi\r\nreports one of the Pope's expressions as \"Be united to me, and not\r\nwith the revolution\" (p. 129), and asks, Who could have imagined that\r\nthe good bishops who had been all their lives fighting the revolution\r\nshould now be accused of revolution? He adds, \"Rulers who endeavour\r\nto degrade Strossmayer to the level of a Rochefort, not unfrequently\r\nreverse the intended result, and raise a Rochefort to the height of a\r\nStrossmayer\" (p. 130).\r\n\r\n\"And you, my dear Orientals,\" said the Pope, \"I have ornaments also\r\nfor you, but not enough of them. I give you what I have.\" Then he\r\ntried to calm their fears, excited by recent collisions. He concluded\r\nby the supreme disclosure, \"We have in the Council the organs of the\r\nLiberal party, whose word of command is to gain time by opposing\r\neverything, and to wear out the patience of the majority.\" The allusion\r\nof the Pope was understood. Bitter, indeed, was it for the bishops\r\nof the minority to find themselves thus stigmatized before all men by\r\nthe sovereign. But the effect was practical. The day following, ten\r\nOrientals announced their adhesion to the denunciation of Gratry by\r\nthe Archbishop of Strasburg. Presently, forty-three missionary bishops\r\npublished their concurrence in the profound discovery of Bonjean, of\r\nCeylon, that the dogma of infallibility would conduce to the conversion\r\nof Buddhists, Brahmans, Protestants, _and other difficult religionists\r\nof the East_.[367]\r\n\r\nAs the Pope went to St. Cross of Jerusalem for the _Agnus Dei_, M.\r\nVeuillot heard cries of \"The Infallible Pope for ever!\" and said that\r\nthis was a reply to the objections raised about the heresy of Pope\r\nHonorius. Hefele had unpleasantly brought this heresy into notice\r\nin a Latin pamphlet, which he had been obliged to print at Naples.\r\nOf inopportune things, few had been more inopportune of late than\r\nthe appearance in Paris of a new edition of the _Liber Diurnus_, by\r\nRozière. This ancient monument, with its simple formula? and infallible\r\nevidence, enabled every one to lay his finger on the fact that for\r\ncenturies Popes had on oath abjured the heresy of Pope Honorius. But M.\r\nVeuillot heard an answer to all this in the cries of \"The Infallible\r\nPope for ever!\"\r\n\r\nBut of all that the Pope passed on his route to Holy Cross, that\r\nwhich most excited the imagination of M. Veuillot was the Holy Stair\r\nand the _triclinium_, where Charlemagne received the sword kneeling.\r\nCharlemagne, he says, ruled only long enough to indicate the place and\r\nform which he wished to give to his throne; but now, after a thousand\r\nyears, his conception is one of the victorious apparitions.\r\n\r\n    When the world merits to re-enter on the path of unity, God will\r\n    raise up a man, or a people, which will be Charlemagne. This\r\n    Charlemagne, man or nation, will be seen here, at the Lateran,\r\n    kneeling before the Pope, returned from dungeons or from exile; and\r\n    the Pope will take the sceptre of the world off the altar, and put\r\n    it into his hands.[368]\r\n\r\nM. Veuillot knows better than he here seems to know. Charlemagne's\r\nconception was that of Constantine over again--a State Church; and over\r\na State Church Charlemagne reigned. The conception of Hildebrand, now\r\nto be acted out, was that of a Church State, for which any Charlemagne\r\nmight conquer, but over which no second head should reign. Unity, as\r\nM. Veuillot well knew, was now to comprehend not only one _fold_, but\r\nalso one _shepherd_. No more dualism! no more two-headed monsters! We\r\nhad come to the dispensation of the spiritual David, Shepherd and King\r\nin one. It is, however, clear that the vision revealed to M. Veuillot,\r\nas in 1867, still disclosed a struggle to come before the victory;\r\nfor his Pope, on taking his place as disposing of the sceptre of the\r\nworld, comes back from dungeons or from exile. Moreover, Veuillot still\r\nsmothers the poor kings in ambiguity. The new and final Charlemagne is\r\nto be a man _or a nation_.\r\n\r\nThe sittings which followed the stormy one were remarkably still; and\r\nit is said that Haynald and Whelan from Wheeling were allowed to say\r\nvery strong things without interruption. It might be supposed that\r\na short chapter on God the Creator of the World, could hardly give\r\nrise to a discussion on the Curial system; but when Rome set out to\r\nspeak about the Creator, she first of all made mention of herself. The\r\nopening words of the chapter were, \"The Holy Roman Catholic Apostolic\r\nChurch.\" To this form exception was taken. One proposed that the word\r\n\"Roman\" should be omitted, which was, of course, offensive to the\r\nCuria, the municipal spirit always forcing into view the shibboleth,\r\nquite unconscious that it marred the show of universality. Indeed,\r\nit is asserted by many that the extreme Curialists wanted the words\r\n\"Roman Church\" alone, without Catholic. Others proposed that the word\r\n\"Catholic\" should stand before \"Roman,\" or at least that a comma should\r\nbe inserted between the two. It is a singular fact that a vote of the\r\nCouncil was actually taken on this question of the comma. On this\r\ngreat question of the comma the committee for once did not tell the\r\nmajority how to vote. _La Liberté du Concile_ thinks that the majority\r\nvoted for the comma. The numbers, however, were not reported in that\r\nsitting; and when the next one was opened, and all waited to hear on\r\nwhich side was the majority, lo! the reporter gets up, and, contrary\r\nto all rule, usage, and decency, quietly sets aside the vote as if it\r\nhad never taken place; does not, indeed, mention it! He simply says\r\nthat the committee has rejected the comma! Now the majority, knowing\r\nhow it ought to vote, did its duty faithfully. So even about a tittle,\r\nin the literal sense, the writer of _La Liberté du Concile_ was highly\r\nincensed, contending that the rights of deliberation were ridden over\r\nroughshod. Finally, the phrase came out as \"The Holy Catholic Apostolic\r\nRoman Church.\" Friedrich thinks that this phraseology compromises the\r\nclaim to represent the Universal Church, and must be taken as only\r\nprofessing to represent the Roman Patriarchate.\r\n\r\nMeantime the minority held anxious deliberations. They doubted whether\r\nthey should not require a positive promise that no Decree touching\r\nfaith should be carried by a majority, and whether if this was denied\r\nthey should not refuse to take part in voting. They finally resolved\r\nthat they would reserve their opposition, as completely as possible,\r\nfor the all-important question of infallibility. They hoped by this\r\nmeans to secure the double end of showing a conciliatory disposition in\r\neverything in which they could give way with a good conscience, and of\r\npreventing a precedent from being established for carrying articles of\r\nfaith by majorities. The last piece of strategy seemed specious. It,\r\nhowever, obviously laboured under the infirmity that they were all the\r\ntime giving strength to the Rules which established the principle of\r\nmajorities.\r\n\r\nThe preamble to the revised Draft of Decrees on Dogma contained not\r\nonly the passage about Protestantism which Strossmayer had criticized,\r\nbut also a clause suggested by the Bishop of Moulins, which virtually\r\ncontained the doctrine of infallibility. This was strongly resisted by\r\nthe minority, but all attempts to get it withdrawn had proved vain.\r\nIn the sitting of the 26th, the order and method of voting, which was\r\nnow for the first time to be put in practice, was fully read out.\r\nBut before the vote was taken, a paper was sent in to the Presiding\r\nCardinals, said to proceed from Bishop Clifford of Clifton. The\r\nPresidents left the Hall, and on their return to the surprise of all,\r\nthe preamble, instead of being put to the vote, was withdrawn. When it\r\nreappeared, the objectionable passage about infallibility was removed,\r\nand the phrase as to Protestantism was moderated; and so the impending\r\ncollision was averted. But the way of doing this showed that majority\r\nand minority were equally far from possessing the guarantees of\r\nlegislative freedom. What would a powerful majority in our Parliament\r\nsay if, after the clauses in a Bill had been settled in Committee, the\r\nMinisters should retire and decide on altering them, and without a word\r\npresent them in a new form to the House for the final vote when no one\r\ncould speak?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 352: _Doc._, i. 176.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 353: _Ibid._ i. 225.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 354: Kenrick's words are: Dixit verbis clarioribus, per\r\nillud nullam omnino doctrinam edoceri; sed eam quatuor capitibus ex\r\nquibus istud decretum compositum est imponi tanquam cis coronidem\r\nconvenientem; eamque disciplinarem magis quam doctrinalem charactererem\r\nhabere.

Reflection,\r\nconversation, and reading had done much since they came to Rome to\r\nclear their views. Even if they read as little of Church history, or\r\nof the current Curial literature, as is intimated in the oft-repeated\r\nlaments of Friedrich, and in the less frequent but equally strong\r\nhints of Quirinus and others, they must surely have read something\r\nof the _Unitá_ if not of the _Civiltá_, or at least of the sprightly\r\n_Univers_. Any one of the three, in spite of that pious style of\r\nmystery which Vitelleschi speaks of, would soon have made a very dull\r\nbishop indeed conscious that the world was going to be transformed.\r\n\r\nThe sagacious Rauscher put the forecast of the time into the form\r\nof a petition, dated April 10, which states the case of the future\r\nposition of Roman Catholic citizens more strongly than some statements\r\nof it in our country, which have been treated as the invention either\r\nof Mr. Gladstone, or at best of Lord Acton, or of some other Liberal\r\nCatholic.[369] The petition is headed as being from several prelates of\r\nFrance, Austria, Hungary, Italy, England, Ireland, and America. The\r\neditor of the _Documenta_ says that Germany should have been added.\r\nAmong the prelates from that country who signed it he specifies the\r\nArchbishops of Munich and Bamberg, the Bishops of Augsburg, Trêves,\r\nErmland, Breslau, Rottenburg, Maintz, Osnabrück, and the Prussian\r\nMilitary Bishop. According to this statement, the name of Ketteler was\r\nto this document. When the German bishops met again at Fulda, after\r\nthe Council, they put forth the very interpretation of the Bull _Unam\r\nSanctam_ which is here solemnly treated as both false and absurd. Of\r\ncourse they were confronted with their own words. Friedrich says, in a\r\nnote (p. 349), that Ketteler in the _Reichstag_, and in the well-known\r\n_Germania_ No. 146, for 1872, asserted that no German bishop had signed\r\nthe petition, and that, therefore, the word \"Germany\" was not found in\r\nthe superscription:--\r\n\r\n    But all this is vain lying and cheating, such as we are well\r\n    accustomed to in the Ultramontane press and its episcopal\r\n    inspirers. In No. 242 of the _Germania_ Ketteler himself owns that\r\n    two German bishops, not Prussian, signed it. In reference to this,\r\n    a theologian, deeply initiated in the secrets of the minority,\r\n    writes to me under date June 20, 1871, that there are many Germans\r\n    among the signatories.\r\n\r\nRauscher, and those who signed with him, alleged that the point about\r\nto be decided bore directly on the instruction to be given to the\r\npeople, and on the relations of civil society to Catholic teaching.\r\nDisclaiming any thought of accusing the Popes of the middle ages of\r\nambition, or of having disturbed civil society, and asserting their\r\nbelief that what the Pontiffs then did was done by virtue of an\r\nexisting state of international law, they go on to say that those Popes\r\nheld that our Lord had committed two swords to the successors of Peter;\r\none, spiritual, which they themselves wielded; the other material,\r\nwhich princes and soldiers ought to wield at their command. Then\r\ndealing with the attempt to represent this Bull as requiring only that\r\nall shall acknowledge the Pope as the head of the Church, they declare\r\nthat gloss to be irreconcilable with love of the truth on the part of\r\nany one who is acquainted with the circumstances as between Boniface\r\nVIII and Philip le Bel; and that, moreover, it is a mode of treating\r\nthe subject which puts weapons into the hands of the enemies of the\r\nChurch to calumniate her. They add, \"Popes, down to the seventeenth\r\ncentury, taught that power over temporal things was committed to them\r\nby God, and they condemn the opposite opinion.\" Mark, they do not say\r\ntemporal authority, but power over temporal things. With them temporal\r\nauthority is authority of temporal origin.\r\n\r\nNow follows a historical statement of great importance. \"We, with\r\nnearly all the bishops of the Catholic world, propound another doctrine\r\nto the Christian people as to the relation of the ecclesiastical power\r\nto the civil.\" They then make the stock comparison of the heavens and\r\nthe earth, as indicating the relative dignity of the spiritual and\r\ntemporal power, and say that each is supreme in its own sphere. The\r\nambiguous phrase \"supreme in its own sphere,\" means, in Ultramontane\r\nlanguage, as we have seen, only that the temporal prince is not subject\r\nto any other temporal power. But these bishops evidently meant at\r\nthe time to be clear of ambiguities. They added an explanation of\r\nimmense significance--\"Neither power in its office is dependent upon\r\nthe other.\" This is a formal and total denial of what the _Civiltá_\r\nhad long been preaching, of what Phillips and Tarquini and all the\r\naccredited modern writers taught. The utmost they ever admit is,\r\nthat in its _nature_, and in its _origin_, temporal power is, or may\r\nbe, independent of the spiritual. But in office all impersonated\r\nauthorities must be dependent on the impersonated authority of the\r\nVicar of God. The next stroke of the petitioners was still bolder.\r\nAdmitting that princes, as members of the Church, are subordinate to\r\nher discipline, they affirm that she does not in any way hold a power\r\nof deposing them, or of releasing their subjects from their allegiance.\r\nStill more incisive was the stroke that followed, for it was aimed at\r\nthe whole principle of Papal authority over the State. They declared\r\nthat the power of judging things, which the Popes of the middle ages\r\nhad exercised, came to them by a certain state of public law; and that,\r\nas the public institutions and even the private circumstances which\r\nthen existed had changed, the power itself has with the foundation of\r\nit passed away. This was the language which might be used before the\r\nBull _Unam Sanctam_ had received the stamp of infallibility. It was\r\nlanguage in which the claims founded on the text \"Teach all nations,\"\r\nor \"I have set thee this day over the nations, and over the kingdoms,\"\r\nare met with a downright denial. The fact that the Popes had at one\r\ntime acted as supreme judges was accounted for by a state of political\r\nrelations, not by a divine right, just, we may say, as the fact would\r\nhave been accounted for that the kings of Persia were appealed to as\r\narbiters by Greeks. Still further, the change which had taken place\r\nwas not only admitted, but it was held to have annulled the former\r\nrelation between the power of the Papacy and civil society. A careful\r\nconsideration of the positions thus stated, and a comparison of them\r\nwith matter in the Curial writings of the present pontificate with\r\nwhich we are already familiar, afford some measure of the distance\r\nseparating the Ultramontanes north of the Alps, of the old type, like\r\nRauscher among the clergy and Montalembert among the laity, from the\r\nnew school formed by the development of the Jesuits into what had now\r\nbecome the Catholic party. We do not say that the old Ultramontanes did\r\nnot give the Pope authority irreconcilable with Holy Scripture, and\r\npower dangerous to civil society. All we can say is that the authority\r\nand power which they did give to him was bounded by a frontier\r\ntolerably defined, and therefore capable of being defended.\r\n\r\nThe remark of the Pope, carried away from the Vatican by numbers of\r\nbishops and not a few laymen, and repeated in every form of gossip\r\nprinted or spoken, to the effect that the bishops of the Opposition\r\nwere only time-servers and Court ecclesiastics, is, in Rauscher's\r\npetition, repelled with dignity and force. Their opinions, as just\r\nstated, they declare are not new but ancient. They were those of\r\nall the Fathers, and of all the Pontiffs down to Gregory VII. They\r\nbelieved them to be the true doctrines of the Catholic Church; for\r\nGod forbid that, under stress of the times, they should adulterate\r\nrevealed truth. But they must point out the dangers which would arise\r\nto the Church from a Decree irreconcilable with the doctrines that they\r\nhave hitherto taught. No one, they affirm, can help seeing that it is\r\nimpossible to reform (they do not say reconstruct) society according to\r\nthe rule laid down in the Bull _Unam Sanctam_. But any right which God\r\nhas indeed given, and any obligation corresponding to such right, is\r\nincapable of being destroyed by the vicissitudes of human institutions\r\nand opinions. If then the Roman Pontiff had received the power of the\r\ntwo swords, as it is asserted in the Bull _Ex Apostolatus Officio_,\r\nhe would, by divine right, hold plenary power over nations and kings;\r\nand it would not be allowable for the Church to conceal this from\r\nthe faithful. But if this was the real form of Christianity as an\r\ninstitution, little would it avail for Catholics to assert that, as\r\nto the power of the Holy See over temporal things, that power would\r\nbe restrained within the bounds of theory, and that it was of no\r\nimportance in relation to actual affairs and events, seeing that Pius\r\nIX was far from thinking of deposing civil rulers.\r\n\r\nThis last statement was directly aimed at Antonelli's habitual mode of\r\nputting the case in conversation with diplomatists, and also as we have\r\nseen in his despatches. But our prelates contend that, in reply to such\r\nassertions,\r\n\r\n    \"opponents would scornfully say, We do not fear the sentences of\r\n    the Pontiffs; but after many and various dissimulations, it has\r\n    become evident at last that\"--(the italics are our own)--\"_every\r\n    Catholic, whose actions are ruled by the faith he professes, is a\r\n    born enemy of the State, since he finds himself bound in conscience\r\n    to contribute, as far as in him lies, to the subjection of all\r\n    nations and kings to the Roman Pontiff_\".\r\n\r\nOn these solemn grounds they formally demand that the question whether\r\nour Lord did or did not commit power over kings and nations to Peter\r\nand to his successors shall be directly proposed to the Council and\r\nexamined in every aspect. In order that the Fathers may not be called\r\nwithout adequate preparation to decide a question the consequences of\r\nwhich must profoundly affect the relations of the Church and civil\r\nsociety, they demand further that this point shall be brought on for\r\ndiscussion before that infallibility. Their petition was not addressed\r\nto the Pontiff in person, but to the Presiding Cardinals.\r\n\r\nNo efforts made since, or which may be made hereafter, can erase this\r\nrecord of the views of the bishops at the time in question. Their\r\nconduct since the Council proves that for themselves, as individuals,\r\nconviction is lost in submission. For the dogma has conquered history.\r\nWith the German bishops submission passed beyond silence, and proceeded\r\nas far as deliberately certifying to the public as ancient views\r\nand sincere ones the very views which they had secretly shown to be\r\ninnovations and pretences, alien to ancient teaching and to their own\r\nbelief. God's two priceless jewels, conscience and conviction, are\r\nhere sent to the bottom of the stagnant pool of submission to a human\r\nking. It is by contemplating such a course of conduct in men with a\r\nposition to hold in the eye of the sun, that we learn the force of such\r\nwords as those of Vitelleschi, when he says that the frequent collision\r\nin Catholic countries between a man's civil conscience and his\r\necclesiastical one is the reason why so often there is no conscience\r\nat all. And men such as these German bishops are the moral guides of\r\nmillions! and out of millions so guided States have to be built up,\r\nand men have to be fitted for the judgment of Him who requireth truth\r\nin the inward parts! And Vitelleschi evidently thinks that, in a moral\r\npoint of view, the German bishops were the best!\r\n\r\nGossip in Rome spoke of Dr. Manning as burning with impatience at\r\nthe delays which had been interposed in the way of the forthcoming\r\ndogma. Baron Arnim told Freidrich how it was said that the Archbishop\r\nprophesied that the governments would be annihilated for their\r\nresistance to it.[370] Quirinus speaks of the Archbishop as expecting\r\na wonderful dispensation of the Holy Ghost to follow the promulgation\r\nof the dogma, and to smooth the way of the Church in her regeneration\r\nof the nations. Whatever may have been the amount of correctness in\r\nthese details, the fact remains that at that moment a mind which had\r\nattracted notice to itself as urging Englishmen to Rome for unity, was\r\nbitterly complained of by Liberal Catholics as being the very genius of\r\ncontraction and division, urging their Church either to beat them down\r\nor to cast them out--to make herself too narrow for them, and to tell\r\nthem that they should be endured only on new conditions.\r\n\r\nAt the same time a cry came from our own shores. It was the voice of\r\none who had made himself conspicuous by alluring Englishmen towards\r\nRome for certainty, and on whose spirit the shadow of a new and dark\r\nuncertainty was now settling down--uncertainty as to the future source\r\nof doctrinal truth; uncertainty as to the doctrinal authority of\r\nexisting documents; uncertainty, in fine, as to what had been, and as\r\nto what was to be, the oracle; uncertainty as to the future work of\r\nGod. At the same moment when Dr. Manning was accused by Roman Catholics\r\nof violating the old terms of unity, Dr. Newman was turned into a\r\nwarning to Protestants as a victim of uncertainty. When describing how\r\nhe and his party fared when first, after shifting from the rock of\r\nHoly Scripture, they settled on another foundation, which they called\r\nAnglicanism or the _Via Media_, Dr. Newman had said:--\r\n\r\n    There they found a haven of rest; thence they looked out on the\r\n    troubled surge of human opinion and upon the crazy vessels which\r\n    were labouring without chart or compass upon it. Judge, then, of\r\n    their dismay when, according to the Arabian tale, on their striking\r\n    their anchor into the supposed soil, lighting their fires on it,\r\n    and fixing in it the poles of their tents, suddenly the island\r\n    began to move, to heave, to splash, to frisk to and fro, to dive,\r\n    and at the last to swim away, spouting out inhospitable jets of\r\n    water upon the credulous mariners who had made it their home.[371]\r\n\r\nWe can hardly doubt that some English parson who in his youth had for\r\na moment felt attracted by the notion of unity and certainty, by\r\nthe charm of vestments, processions, and banners, thanked God on the\r\nmorning after he had read the following letter, when he looked at the\r\nfamily Bible, that he had not left the solid ground and set up a tent\r\non what Dr. Newman and his Anglicans told people was solid ground, but\r\nwhich proved to be the sporting and frisking monster that he himself\r\ndescribed. Ay, and perhaps some Cornish miner, as he went down into his\r\ndarkness, happy in his Saviour--a Saviour who seemed to come nearer to\r\nhim as day and man, as home and the fair sky, went farther away--so\r\nhappy that he hummed--\r\n\r\n In darkest shades, if Thou appear,\r\n   My dawning is begun:\r\n Thou art my soul's bright morning star,\r\n   And Thou my rising sun--\r\n\r\nperhaps this miner put up a prayer for the poor gentleman in Birmingham\r\nwho was in such uncertainty about what might be his creed by next\r\nChristmas, and yet knew no better than to beg of Augustine and Ambrose\r\nto prevail upon the Almighty not to let His Church tell out all the\r\ntruth about the Vicar whom the gentleman fancied that He had set over\r\nher, but to cause her to practise reserve, or to speak in non-natural\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\nTo avoid contamination by impure authorities we shall follow only the\r\n_Civiltá_ in its narrative of the Newman incident.[372] The _Standard_\r\nstated that Dr. Newman, in a letter to his bishop, then absent in\r\nRome, had called the promoters of infallibility an insolent and\r\naggressive faction, and had prayed to God to avert from His Church the\r\nthreatening danger. The _Weekly Register_ declared itself authorized\r\nby a personal friend of Dr. Newman to give the most absolute denial to\r\nthis deliberate fiction. Dr. Newman himself wrote to the _Standard_\r\nto deny that he had written to his bishop and called the promoters\r\nof infallibility an insolent and aggressive faction. Yet, after Dr.\r\nNewman's method, there were words and words about it. Soon appeared in\r\nthe _Standard_ a second letter from him, confessing that he had been\r\ninformed from London that several copies of his letter existed in that\r\ncity, containing the affirmation which he had denied. He now said\r\nthat, before sending his contradiction, he had looked at the notes of\r\nthe letter to his bishop, and had not found the words \"insolent and\r\naggressive faction.\" But he confessed that since learning that several\r\npeople in London had those words in their possession, he had looked\r\nagain and found them. He added that by the faction he did not mean that\r\nlarge number of bishops who had declared in favour of infallibility,\r\nnor yet the Jesuits. He meant a collection of persons of different\r\ncountries, ranks, and conditions in the Church.\r\n\r\nThe _Civiltá_ was careful to remark that Dr. Newman had not withdrawn\r\nhis offensive words. Others no less remarked that he had never\r\nconfessed to a single point in his own statement till compelled to do\r\nso. He had published a contradiction which to ordinary Englishmen would\r\nseem to carry an almost complete denial of the whole allegation. But\r\nthe _Standard_ on April 7 published the following letter, showing that\r\nnot only the substance of the allegation was correct, but also its\r\ndetails:--\r\n\r\n    Rome ought to be a name to lighten the heart at all times, and a\r\n    Council's proper office is, when some great heresy or other evil\r\n    impends, to inspire hope and confidence in the faithful; but now\r\n    we have the greatest meeting which ever has been, and that at\r\n    Rome, infusing into us by the accredited organs of Rome and of its\r\n    partisans (such as the _Civiltá_, [the _Armonia_], the _Univers_,\r\n    and the _Tablet_) little else than fear and dismay. When we are all\r\n    at rest, and have no doubts, and--at least practically, not to say\r\n    doctrinally--hold the Holy Father to be infallible, suddenly there\r\n    is thunder in the clearest sky, and we are told to prepare for\r\n    something, we know not what, to try our faith, we know not how. No\r\n    impending danger is to be averted, but a great difficulty is to be\r\n    created. Is this the proper work of an OEumenical Council?\r\n\r\n    As to myself personally, please God, I do not expect any trial\r\n    at all; but I cannot help suffering with the many souls who are\r\n    suffering, and I look with anxiety at the prospect of having to\r\n    defend decisions which may not be difficult to my own private\r\n    judgment, but may be most difficult to maintain logically in the\r\n    face of historical facts.\r\n\r\n    What have we done to be treated as the faithful never were treated\r\n    before? When has a definition _de fide_ been a luxury of devotion\r\n    and not a stern, painful necessity? Why should an aggressive,\r\n    insolent faction be allowed to \"make the heart of the just sad,\r\n    whom the Lord hath not made sorrowful\"? Why cannot we be let alone\r\n    when we have pursued peace and thought no evil?\r\n\r\n    I assure you, my lord, some of the truest minds are driven one way\r\n    and another, and do not know where to rest their feet--one day\r\n    determining \"to give up all theology as a bad job,\" and recklessly\r\n    to believe henceforth almost that the Pope is impeccable, at\r\n    another tempted to \"believe all the worst which a book like _Janus_\r\n    says,\" others doubting about \"the capacity possessed by bishops\r\n    drawn from all corners of the earth to judge what is fitting for\r\n    European society,\" and then, again, angry with the Holy See for\r\n    listening to \"the flattery of a clique of Jesuits, Redemptorists,\r\n    and converts.\"\r\n\r\n    Then, again, think of the store of pontifical scandals in the\r\n    history of eighteen centuries, which have partly been poured\r\n    forth and partly are still to come. What Murphy inflicted upon us\r\n    in one way M. Veuillot is indirectly bringing on us in another.\r\n    And then again the blight which is falling upon the multitude\r\n    of Anglican Ritualists, etc., who themselves perhaps--at least\r\n    their leaders--may never become Catholics, but who are leavening\r\n    the various English denominations and parties (far beyond their\r\n    own range) with principles and sentiments tending towards their\r\n    ultimate absorption into the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\n    With these thoughts ever before me, I am continually asking myself\r\n    whether I ought not to make my feelings public; but all I do is to\r\n    pray those early doctors of the Church, whose intercession would\r\n    decide the matter (Augustine, Ambrose, and Jerome, Athanasius,\r\n    Chrysostom, and Basil), to avert this great calamity.\r\n\r\n    If it is God's will that the Pope's infallibility be defined, then\r\n    is it God's will to throw back \"the times and moments\" of that\r\n    triumph which He has destined for His kingdom, and I shall feel I\r\n    have but to bow my head to His adorable, inscrutable providence.\r\n\r\n    You have not touched upon the subject yourself, but I think you\r\n    will allow me to express to you feelings which, for the most part,\r\n    I keep to myself....\r\n\r\nThis letter could not, because of Dr. Newman's reputation, be\r\npassed over in silence. The _Civiltá_ well knew how to utilize that\r\nreputation, yet it indicates by its mode of dealing with him that it\r\ndoes not set Dr. Newman so high, either intellectually or morally, as\r\nhis own countrymen do. It treated the whole affair as a temptation of\r\none of a pious imagination but a sickly judgment. The temptation was\r\none peculiar to Englishmen--it was low spirits. An Englishman labouring\r\nunder that temptation would read the _Civiltá_, the _Armonia_, the\r\n_Univers_, etc., with sombre-coloured spectacles. It was a disease in\r\nthe eyes. Those affected by it looked upon the definition of a verity\r\nas a scourge of God, an affliction not merited! Still, as Dr. Newman\r\ndid not for himself fear it, he would be able to explain it to others.\r\nBut the definition of a truth was to prove a blight for the poor\r\nAnglican Ritualists:--\r\n\r\n    Do you not perceive that it is only temptation that makes you see\r\n    everything black?... If the holy doctors whom you invoke, Ambrose,\r\n    Jerome, etc., do not decide the controversy in your way, it is not,\r\n    as the Protestant _Pall Mall Gazette_ fancies, because they will\r\n    not or cannot interpose, but because they agree with St. Peter\r\n    and with the petition of the majority.... Would you have us make\r\n    processions in sackcloth and ashes to avert this scourge of the\r\n    definition of a verity? And if it is defined, when the Fathers\r\n    chant _Te Deum_ will some of you intone the _Miserere_? On the\r\n    contrary, you too will applaud it.... Dupanloup will not merely be\r\n    resigned, he will be a champion of infallibility, and we shall all\r\n    together say, Amen, hallelujah! and it also will be a hymn like\r\n    the song in the Apocalypse.... Get rid of this ugly melancholy\r\n    temptation. It makes you lose your logic and your English good\r\n    sense. Even the Protestant journals teach you better, and as one\r\n    devil cast out another, a Protestant article may serve to cast out\r\n    a temptation.\r\n\r\nThe compassionate Jesuits of the _Civiltá_ then proceed to cast the\r\none devil out of Dr. Newman by the aid of two others, which are\r\nrespectively the _Pall Mall Gazette_ and the _Manchester Examiner\r\nand Times_--the former in an appearance of April 8, the latter in\r\nan appearance of April 9. Lest this exorcism should not suffice, it\r\ncalls to its aid seven other spirits equally evil--the _Times_, the\r\n_Saturday Review_, the _Telegraph_, the _Daily News_, the _Spectator_,\r\nthe _Standard_, and the _Echo_. All these, fallen angels though they\r\nwere, had agreed in the opinion that a religious truth had better be\r\ntold than hidden, and that a Church which had an infallible head ought\r\nto know it. Though on this one point right, these Protestant journals\r\nhad, however, held up the letter of Dr. Newman as a proof of internal\r\ndivision underlying a vaunted unity. But in this they were illogical.\r\nWith this boast the _Civiltá_ fitly couples a declaration of Dr.\r\nNewman, in which the tortured spirit, whose piercing cry had reached\r\nthe ear of the world through thick walls, and had been identified\r\nin spite of artful windings, puts on, in presence of Protestants,\r\nanother voice, wishing them to become partakers of its satisfaction\r\nand repose! M. Veuillot was not the man tamely to find himself coupled\r\nwith Mr. Murphy by one like Dr. Newman, whom, if repute in England set\r\nextravagantly high, certainly he did not. He told how the _Univers_\r\nhad begged four thousand pounds for Dr. Newman and sent it to him, on\r\nthe occasion when he was cast in damages for a libel on Achilli, an\r\nex-censor of the press, at Viterbo, who had become a Protestant:--\r\n\r\n    \"The respectable convict,\" says Veuillot, \"received it and was\r\n    pleased, but he gave no thanks and showed no courtesy. Father\r\n    Newman ought to be more careful in what he says; everything that is\r\n    comely demands it of him. But, at any rate, if his Liberal passion\r\n    carries him away till he forgets what he owes to us and to himself,\r\n    what answer must one give him, but that he had better go on as he\r\n    set out, silently ungrateful?\"[373]\r\n\r\nSuch were the inhospitable jets spouted out upon Dr. Newman by the\r\nfloundering creature on the back of which the twice \"credulous mariner\"\r\nhad pitched his tent. Englishmen may smile at finding Dr. Newman\r\naspersed with the reproach of Liberalism. His puerile spite at the\r\nvery name of it, as shown in his writings, thus found its Nemesis. M.\r\nVeuillot, by a link of connexion which is not obvious, confesses that\r\nhe too, in youth and inexperience, indulged in dreams of peace. But\r\nhis mature ideas were ruled by a manlier spirit. \"I dream of a long\r\nwar--long, hot, inexorable, and one that will change the face of the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nFor some time past the Orientals had been receiving and giving cause\r\nfor solicitude. The incident already related of the Chaldean Patriarch\r\nwas but a symptom of general uneasiness. The Pontiff had resolved\r\non abrogating the old right of electing bishops, under which the\r\ncommunities nominated three persons, of whom the Patriarch instituted\r\nthe one whom he preferred. We have seen how the Chaldean Patriarch was\r\novercome. Jussef, the Melchite Patriarch, refused to surrender his\r\nrights, and it is said that, in an audience before other Orientals,\r\nthe Pope went so far as to seize him by the shoulders.[374] The Syrian\r\nPatriarch, on receiving the Pope's command, had taken to his bed, and\r\nhad not yet answered. The Maronite Patriarch had refused his consent,\r\nand had, notwithstanding repeated invitations, stayed in Antioch,\r\ninstead of coming on to the Council.\r\n\r\nThe Armenians, however, excited more attention than all the others.\r\nTheir Patriarch, Hassun, had, some time before, surrendered his rights,\r\nand while, in consequence, rising high in favour with the Curia, had\r\nincurred ill-will among his own people. Rome, taking advantage of\r\nhis concessions, had made new and exorbitant claims, on which the\r\nyoke of the Papacy was thrown off. Imperative orders to submit were\r\ndisregarded. A special commissioner was sent from Rome to allay the\r\ndisturbance, but his success was very limited.\r\n\r\nFor some time rumours had been floating about the city that two\r\nOriental bishops had been thrown into prison. These changed to rumours\r\nof an arrest, and an escape. At last the _Univers_[375] published an\r\naccount, stating that the theologian attached to an Armenian bishop\r\nhad used such language respecting the authorities, that Cardinal\r\nBarnabò, Prefect of the Propaganda, had ordered him to the Convent of\r\nthe Passionists. But he refused to go in such terms that the Cardinal\r\nVicar was obliged to employ force. The theologian was then taken from\r\nthe residence of the bishop, and put into a vehicle. He was, however,\r\nso violent that the \"agents\" let him escape into the house again, and\r\nthough they there attempted a second time to take him, they finally\r\ngave way before the opposition of the bishop.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the _Univers_ mentions \"a much graver fact.\" The\r\nPontiff had ordered an apostolic visitation of the convent of the\r\nArmenians, which stands just behind the Colonnade of St. Peter's. The\r\ntwelve who once walked among men with the humble name of apostles would\r\nhave little thought that an apostolic visitation should come to mean an\r\ninspection by an officer of the King and Pontiff of Rome. The Bishop\r\nKsagian (_sic_) refused to receive the visitor. The Pope ordered the\r\nbishop to the Convent of St. Sabina. The bishop, however, refused to\r\ngo, and appealed to Bishop Place, of Marseilles, to procure French\r\nprotection for him.\r\n\r\n_Ce Qui se Passe au Concile_ (p. 144) says that Bahtiarian, an Armenian\r\nArchbishop, had his Vicar-General with him, against whom some one\r\ninformed, as having spoken with hostility of Hassun, the Romanized\r\nPatriarch whom we have just mentioned, and of Valerga, the so-called\r\nPatriarch of Jerusalem. Cardinal Barnabò ordered the Vicar-General to\r\na Jesuit convent, but the Archbishop insisted that he would not allow\r\nhim to go, except upon a written order from the Pope himself. We are\r\nnot sure whether this represents the first scene in the account of the\r\n_Univers_.\r\n\r\nSome days afterwards, proceeds _Ce Qui se Passe au Concile_, as\r\nBahtiarian was going to say Mass, his Vicar-General followed him,\r\ncarrying the missal, accompanied by another Armenian priest. In the\r\nstreet the Archbishop passed through a group of police, headed by an\r\nofficer. They seized the two priests who were walking behind him, and\r\ndragged them to a vehicle. The Orientals valiantly defended themselves,\r\nand a struggle ensued. Hearing cries, the Archbishop turned back, and\r\nsaw his Vicar-General down, and the missal on the ground being trampled\r\nupon. He rushed forward, pointing to the book, and crying, \"It is the\r\nGospel: it is the Gospel of Christ! Do you treat the Gospel like that?\"\r\nThe officer did not dare to do violence to the Archbishop, who managed\r\nto carry off his Vicar-General, and that day both of them took refuge\r\nin the Armenian Convent. It would seem that now followed the order\r\nfor a visitation of the convent, which Archbishop Casangian (as this\r\naccount correctly gives the name and title) resisted; and he, in turn,\r\nreceived an order to go to a convent for \"retirement.\" It is even said\r\nthat leave to quit Rome was refused by the police to all the Armenians,\r\nnot excepting a bishop who was furnished with a medical certificate\r\nthat it was necessary for his health.\r\n\r\nThe _Civiltá_ and the _Acta Sanctæ Sedis_ do not mention the arrests.\r\nThe one says that Kasangian, as they spell his name, was Abbot-General\r\nby arbitrary election, the other that he was so by tolerance of the\r\nPope. The visitation was first attempted by a Passionist Father,\r\ndelegated by Pluym, a bishop _in partibus_, who had been by the Pope\r\nappointed Visitor-General of the Order. The attempt was resisted. The\r\ndocument which gives to Pluym his powers calmly says that \"_power\r\ndivinely conferred resides in the Pope of loosing, by his sentence,\r\nthe things bound by sentence of any judges whomsoever_.\"[376] The\r\ndisobedient Archbishop and the local Abbot were both ordered to another\r\nconvent, _for spiritual exercises_, as long as the Pope should appoint.\r\nThey both refused to go. Fresh letters gave the powers of visitor to no\r\nless a person than Valenziani, the bishop who in the Council read the\r\nDecrees. These letters declared Archbishop Kasangian deposed from the\r\noffice of Abbot-General of the Order; declared the office of the Abbot\r\nof the monastery vacant, and all other offices within it whatsoever;\r\ndeclared that no authority existed in that house but what flowed from\r\nValenziani, and declared that all pains and penalties he might impose\r\nshould be ratified.\r\n\r\nSo armed, Valenziani presented himself with consummate address and\r\nadmirable suavity. Even according to the _Acta Sanctæ Sedis_, he\r\ndeclared that his visitation had no object but to lead the Armenians to\r\nfulfil their duty. But the Orientals knew the double tongue. In his own\r\nwords, they lent no obedient ear. Others say that they would not allow\r\nthe Pope's brief to be read. Defied and defeated in the very \"street of\r\nthe Holy Office,\" Valenziani had the once terrible interdict fastened\r\nto the door of the rebellious convent. It was owing, says the _Acta\r\nSanctæ Sedis_, to the clemency of the Holy See that the _severest\r\npunishment_, such as was due to the offence, was not inflicted.[377]\r\nOthers told of different causes.\r\n\r\nThe protection of France being refused to the Armenians, the strange\r\nspectacle was seen, as Vitelleschi puts it, of brethren in Christ\r\nbeing forced to seek protection against His Vicar from a Turk (p.\r\n130). Rustum Bey, the Ottoman ambassador, came from Florence, and,\r\nit is said, was not well received, by Antonelli, who gave him to\r\nunderstand that, in Rome, all priests were subjects of the Pope. But\r\nthe ambassador would not waive the rights of the Porte, which, he\r\nalleged, was obliged to show favour to the Armenians, to prevent them\r\nfrom throwing themselves into the arms of Russia. The day of unity had\r\nnot yet dawned. The poor world had still to suffer from more heads than\r\none. Finally, after specious attempts of the authorities to get the\r\nArmenians into their power, and wonderful wariness and dexterity on the\r\npart of the Orientals, one morning the convent behind the colonnades\r\nof St. Peter's was found empty--not the first time that a convent had\r\nbeen left empty in Rome. The monks had somehow managed to take their\r\nflight from a spot only a few yards from the Inquisition and within\r\nrifle shot of scores of convents--in which \"retirement\" for \"religious\r\nexercises\" might have been, for them, a very serious matter. It is\r\nsaid that, before the flight, Rustum Bey told the monks, in case of\r\nneed, to hoist the Turkish flag, and threatened that, if any harm was\r\ndone to them, reprisals should be taken on Romish convents in Turkey.\r\nIndeed, M. Veuillot goes so far as to assert that they actually did\r\nhoist the Turkish flag, and also the French. He says that they executed\r\nthe sentence of excommunication upon themselves (ii. 87). If they did\r\nhoist the Turkish flag, it would have been a curious sight to see the\r\ntwo emblems of religion and physical force which still survive in\r\nEurope--the crescent, and the keys and tiara--floating side by side,\r\nclose by the prisons of the Inquisition and the circus where Nero gave\r\nto unity by physical force, his pontifical sanction. It was asserted\r\nthat attempts were made to put the Armenian Archbishop of Tarsis also\r\ninto \"retirement.\"[378]\r\n\r\nThe exaggerated rumours afloat regarding espionage would be stimulated\r\nby anecdotes like the above. It seems to have been agreed, on all\r\nhands, that during the Council the force detailed for that important\r\nduty had been increased manifold. Friedrich mentions one Papal\r\nofficer who said that out of every fifty persons fifteen were spies.\r\nHe gave examples of people now living handsomely who were known to\r\nhave nothing. One Marchese had set up his carriage. Why, Friedrich\r\nsays, even the train-bearer of a Cardinal will give a dinner to the\r\ntrain-bearers of the other Cardinals in order to spy them out. He\r\nnaturally enough remarks that a historian learns a good deal by finding\r\nhimself amidst such a state of things. It enables him to understand\r\nmany things in history. But, strangest of all, reflects the Professor,\r\nis it to find people looking on this worn-out system as the model for\r\nthe whole earth. It is, however, just the fact that such a state of\r\nthings was looked upon as the model for the whole earth, that gives a\r\ndeep interest to every trait showing what that state of things really\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nFriedrich, remarking that the Count De Chambord, as a dispossessed\r\nprince who expected his throne back from the infallible Pope, very\r\nnaturally was an Infallibilist, goes on to say that only dispossessed\r\nprinces are papistically minded. They were nearly all waiting in Rome,\r\nand he had reason to know that they expected that the declaration of\r\ninfallibility, and the things connected therewith, would lead to their\r\nrestoration, as the Pope certainly expected that it would lead to the\r\nrecovery of his own States.[379]\r\n\r\nApril 24 was the day fixed for the third public session. The first had\r\nbeen devoted to the opening ceremony, the second to the swearing of\r\nthe Creed; but this was one for the promulgation of Decrees. Up to\r\nthe last it was doubtful whether all the bishops of the minority would\r\nadopt the policy recommended by the leaders, not to cause any division\r\ninto majority and minority till the struggle on infallibility itself\r\ncame on. Some say that Kenrick and Strossmayer held out so far as to\r\nstay away. But Kenrick voted, although, as we have seen, he expressed\r\nregret at having yielded to others instead of following his own\r\njudgment. The robes for the day were red. The doors of the house were\r\nthrown open, and non-members who had a place in the galleries were not\r\nrequired to withdraw at the time when the Rules prescribed that they\r\nshould do so. When the Decrees were handed from the throne, Valenziani\r\nread them out from the pulpit. Jacobini, the Sub-Secretary, then\r\nascended it, and called out the name of Cardinal Mattei. \"_Absent!_\"\r\ncried a voice from near the throne. \"_Absent!_\" cried a voice from\r\nnear the door, at the other end of the Hall. Jacobini then called out,\r\n\"Constantine, Bishop of Porto\"; and Patrizi, rising, said \"_Placet._\"\r\n\"_Placet_,\" cried the voice from near the throne. \"_Placet_,\" cried the\r\nvoice from near the door, and the scrutineers and officers registered\r\nthe vote. It was not long before a test name was called--that of\r\nSchwarzenberg, one of the few Cardinals older than the present\r\npontificate. He had already advised the policy of concession for\r\nto-day, saying, \"We must not blow our powder away.\" But this was not\r\nknown to all the majority, and when the magnificent prince pronounced\r\nhis _Placet_, there was a manifest expression of relief. When the\r\nCardinals had all been called the names were no longer repeated--only\r\nthe title of the See.\r\n\r\nCardinal Manning relates how diplomatists, who had hoped to see\r\ndivision, were struck as they looked from their galleries, and saw the\r\nleaders of the Opposition, one after another, stand up and pronounce\r\ntheir _Placet_. Friedrich says that the countenances of the Jesuits\r\nchanged from gloom to delight, when Schwarzenberg, Hohenlohe, Darboy,\r\nand others, gave in their votes, and that they manifested a particular\r\ninterest in that of Hefele. He also says that the gentlemen who were\r\nwith him in the tribune figuring as theologians, but whom he calls\r\ntrain-bearers, were intensely anxious about the indispensable sunbeams,\r\nwhich, however, he adds, were for that day cut off from the Hall. Just\r\nas the Pope entered the assembly, the sunbeams did pass the threshold;\r\nand the gentlemen around him cried out, \"The sun, the sun!\" their\r\neyes dancing for joy. After the Decrees had been passed, the Pope\r\npronounced a short allocution, rejoicing in their unity, and saying,\r\n\"Our Lord Jesus Christ gave peace to His apostles, and I also, who am\r\nHis unworthy Vicar, in His name give peace to you.\" Friedrich says\r\nthat some French bishops hailed this with clapping of hands, but that,\r\ninstead of this being general, there were signs of dissatisfaction, and\r\nparticularly from the galleries. The first statement is confirmed by\r\nthe _Acta Sanctæ Sedis_.\r\n\r\nFriedrich could hardly catch the formula in which the Pope announced\r\nhis passing of the Decrees; but it struck him that it was not the same\r\nas that prescribed in the Rules; and on receiving the text as passed,\r\nhe found that a change had been made without any intimation whatever\r\nhaving been given of it. To him the change was nothing, as the new\r\nform only said what he knew the previous one meant, although bishops\r\nhad seriously differed with him for saying so. The Rules prescribe the\r\nformula, \"We decree, enact, and sanction\"; and this was now changed to\r\nthe more compact and expressive Papistical formula, \"We define, and,\r\nby apostolic authority confirm.\" The word \"sanction\" had a flavour of\r\nhistoric dualism.\r\n\r\nThe Curialists boasted, after this session, that they had gained three\r\npoints, and the statement of them shows a clear conception of their own\r\nstrategy and of the positions to be won:[380] first, the Pope had, for\r\nthe first time in three hundred and fifty years, proclaimed Decrees\r\nin a Council in his own name only, merely mentioning the Council as\r\napproving; secondly, the new Rules had been accepted; thirdly, the\r\nfinal clause of the Decrees carried the conclusion that the former\r\ndogmatic Decrees of the Popes were accepted as of authority. This last\r\npoint alone was of prodigious consequence, and vindicates Friedrich's\r\ndiscernment in tracing the Curial system at first sight in these\r\napparently elementary and rather feeble chapters. Only one fortnight\r\nearlier, as we have seen, Cardinals and prelates declared that they\r\nand the majority of bishops in great nations had taught in direct\r\ncontradiction to the Bull _Unam Sanctam_. But from to-day both that\r\nBull and, among others, the _Ex Apostolatus Officio_ of Paul IV, the\r\nfather of the Roman Inquisition, were of Divine authority! Or, as\r\nQuirinus puts it, \"Rules of faith for the whole Catholic world, and\r\nthus it will be taught universally in Europe and America, henceforth,\r\nthat the Pope is absolute master in temporal affairs also; that he\r\ncan order war or peace, and that every monarch or bishop who does\r\nnot submit to him, or helps any one separated from him, ought to be\r\ndeprived of his throne, if not of his life\" (p. 471).\r\n\r\nThe Decrees contain eighteen anathemas! Vitelleschi says, that of those\r\nin the cathedral who paid any attention to the proceedings, none seemed\r\never to reflect that, as Catholics, they would lie down that night with\r\nnew articles of faith and new declarations (anathemas) weighing on\r\ntheir intellect and conscience. \"Authority\" teaches men to admit new\r\ncreeds with awful facility, and to utter anathemas almost as readily as\r\na primitive Christian would have said, God bless you! The Curialists\r\ndid not exaggerate the substantial victory which had been won, or\r\nthe practical importance of the three points already specified. The\r\nlegislative effect of those points upon what little of constitutional\r\narrangements had still been left in the Romish communion was very\r\ngreat. They linked all the past dogmatic Decrees of the Popes to the\r\nauthority of the Creator of the world. The unfailing interpreter of\r\nthe view taken by the Court of the position of affairs, M. Veuillot,\r\nsays (i. 472), \"The last paragraph confirms all the Constitutions, and\r\napostolical Decrees, which condemn the errors of the times. Thus have\r\nthe condemnations pronounced in the Syllabus received the official\r\nstamp.\"[381]\r\n\r\nEven the anathemas were pleasant to M. Veuillot's cultured taste. \"You\r\nhave read the eighteen anathemas against errors pronounced in the old\r\nform of the sovereignty of the Church.\" Some had said that there would\r\nbe no more anathemas, some that they did not want any more. \"But there\r\nthey are, and there they are for eternity. In my view, the work of\r\nrevolt accomplished during a hundred years falls smitten with old age\"\r\n(ii. 45, 46).\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards, chiding the _Figaro_, the _Gaulois_, and other\r\njournals, for asking what the Council was doing, he replied, \"The\r\nCouncil is making a wide and deep furrow like the grave of a world. You\r\nwill go down into that furrow, and you will not spring up\" (ii. 58). As\r\nto the _plébiscite_ then about to be taken in France, he said that he\r\ncould not vote Yes, because that would be permanently handing oneself\r\nover to princes who would not take any engagement to the Church; and he\r\nwould not say No, for he did not wish to precipitate disasters (ii. 66).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 369: _Documenta_, ii. 388.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 370: _Tagebuch_, p. 283.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 371: _The Tractarian Movement._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 372: VII. x. 348 ff.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 373: Vol. ii. pp. 31-34.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 374: _Tagebuch_, p. 344.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 375: _Ibid._ p. 304.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 376: _Acta Sanctæ Sedis_, v. 447.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 377: _Acta Sanctæ Sedis_, vol. v. 501-7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 378: Compare _Tagebuch_ (pp. 304, 324, 325, and 344) with\r\n_Quirinus_ (p. 432) and _Vitelleschi_ (p. 130).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 379: _Tagebuch_, p. 358.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 380: _Quirinus_, p. 477.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 381: The _Civiltá_, without naming the Syllabus, asserts that\r\nby this paragraph the Council itself has put a new seal on all the\r\nacts of the Pontiff condemning erroneous opinions.

Increased resort to the oracle would certainly\r\nfollow the lifting of its Decrees above all dispute. What, indeed,\r\nthey might well ask, would not a party in some hot dispute pay for a\r\nDecree that could never be disturbed? and in high affairs of State,\r\nwhen some Croesus had set his heart on a great enterprise, would he\r\nnot make offerings to the oracle, which even a Herodotus might rejoice\r\nto immortalize? Moreover, as Quirinus adds, almost every Roman had a\r\nbrother, an uncle, or a cousin, in the clerical circle around which the\r\nprofits would be distributed. If bishops, with countries to call their\r\nown, feared the result of the attempt to set up clerical authority\r\nabove civil, Roman prelates who had no country, but were only the\r\npolitical dependents of foreigners, openly declared that they looked\r\nupon the restoration of spiritual authority over temporal affairs as\r\nthe one thing called for by the times. So long as this notion was\r\nconfined to the Roman prelates proper, one could comprehend it. They\r\nhad lived apart from men and affairs, except their own affairs, and\r\nwere absolute strangers to the actual age and world. But that bishops\r\nfrom free countries or great ones should entertain such dreams, or\r\nwhile not themselves sharing in the illusions, should adopt the\r\nreligious expedients by which it was hoped to give them effect, is\r\nmarvellous. Perhaps it may be partly explained by that weakening of the\r\nindividual conscience and will, through the principle of authority, to\r\nwhich Vitelleschi so instructively refers; by that complete personal\r\ndependence of bishops on the Curia for consideration, and even for\r\nmeans, which is noted on all hands; by the unbroken habit of yielding\r\nto Rome, or of being beaten in every attempt at resistance; by old age,\r\nand by the incurable isolation of the men themselves from humanity.\r\nThey were men bound, as we view it, only by artificial ties, to a guild\r\nbent upon ruling the world, while they themselves received gold rings\r\nand goodly apparel for bearing their share in the enterprise. Or, as\r\nthey viewed it, they were men separated from the world, identified only\r\nwith the Church and the clergy, and utterly dependent upon the Vicar\r\nof God. What could they do? A quarrel with a government had hitherto\r\nalways brought a bishop glory, but not so a quarrel with the Curia.\r\nIn the former case, the Pope took care to make up to the bishop in\r\nprofessional advantage more than he could lose by political collision.\r\nIn the latter case, no government could or would make up to him for\r\ndisgrace or ruin. A martyr bishop was one of the most effective figures\r\nin every Church display. A great occasion would be comparatively dull\r\nwithout one. Governments could make no such use of bishops who might\r\nsuffer for loyalty.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to find in the Archbishop of Baltimore one of the keenest\r\npartisans of infallibility. Formerly, Dr. Spalding had foretold that\r\nthe dogma would only occasion difficulties, and had advised resistance.\r\nThe causes of his new zeal were of course discussed in Rome, where\r\nchanges of opinion are liable to be assigned to personal rather than to\r\npublic motives. Spalding prepared a formula of infallibility to the\r\neffect that all Papal decisions must be received with internal assent.\r\nIt is even said that he took this for a mild form compared with the\r\ndirect declaration of the doctrine. Two of his American colleagues, on\r\nthe other hand, the Archbishops of St. Lewis and of Cincinnati, bore a\r\ndistinguished part among the prelates of the minority, as did also the\r\nArchbishop of Halifax.[383] Kenrick, of St. Lewis, left an impression\r\nof force equalled only by few prelates in the assembly.\r\n\r\nThe question of infallibility had been a good while in the hands of\r\nthe committee before the latter gave any sign of being ready with the\r\nformula. Some thought that the committee was not unwilling to let time\r\npass before forcing matters to an issue. The minority had now become\r\nanxious for delay, in the hope that the dreaded Chapter XI. would not\r\nbe brought on before the heats of the Roman summer should disperse the\r\nCouncil. They had the whole of the Decrees on the Duty of Bishops,\r\non the Life of the Clergy, on the Catechism, and ten chapters of the\r\nDecree on the General Constitution of the Church, to discuss before\r\nthe critical eleventh chapter would come on. But these hopes of delay\r\non the part of the minority were perfectly understood by the Curia.\r\nIt was determined not to let the patience of the majority be worn\r\nout. The impatience of men like Mermillod may be imagined when even\r\nBishop Martin is quoted by Friedrich as expressing a wish that the\r\nGaribaldians would come and scatter the Council. But most impatient of\r\nall was the Pontiff. Briefs and speeches equally tingled with the same\r\nexcitement. M. Veuillot found it necessary to declare that the Pope\r\nwas not impatient, but resolute. Still he let it out that something\r\nhad been hoped for even at the last public session (ii. 45). The voice\r\nof the people crying, \"The Infallible Pope for ever,\" had sounded\r\nin Veuillot's ears during the Easter festivities, and again on the\r\nanniversary of the return from exile. But when, oh when would the voice\r\nof God sound? Pius IX would know God's moment, and would take it. As\r\nto the cries which nourished the faith of M. Veuillot, the deaf ears\r\nof Quirinus and Friedrich heard only faint ones--two voices or three.\r\nThese writers, at least one or other of them, suggested a calculation\r\nas to how many _baiocchi_, or halfpence, the cries cost.\r\n\r\nThe mission of Pius IX was but half fulfilled. He had secured the\r\nImmaculate Conception, but not yet the Infallibility; and this was to\r\nbe, and it must be soon. What Quirinus says (p. 526) of the Pope's two\r\nfixed ideas is in harmony with the general belief; they were, first, a\r\npersuasion of the infallibility of all his predecessors; and, secondly,\r\na persuasion of his own special inspiration by the Virgin.\r\n\r\nExcitement was created in Rome by the appearance of _Ce Qui se Passe au\r\nConcile_. It was believed to be written by the Abbé Gaillard, and said\r\nby M. Veuillot to be at least by a theologian; but he did not hesitate\r\nto insinuate that it was written under the eye of bishops.[384] By all\r\nLiberal Catholics, entitled to be heard, it was and is looked upon as\r\nan undeniable summary of facts. The Council condemned it, the organs\r\ndenounced it; but none the less, when you inquire even in Rome for\r\ngood information, it is sure to be named, sometimes even by privileged\r\nmen. M. Veuillot gives its official character thus: \"Lies, calumnies,\r\ndefamations, beyond count. Lies double, fourfold, tenfold. The general\r\nlie contains another, and that another, and that yet another, so there\r\nis no end.\" But many pages of righteous indignation expressed in this\r\nstyle leave you to ask, what single fact has been disproved by this\r\ngentleman who gives the lie so spiritedly? (ii. 98). Much the same may\r\nbe said of the other of \"the two modern Fathers,\" Margotti.\r\n\r\nThe day previous to the late public session, a deputation of bishops\r\nhad been received with great distinction by his Holiness. They said\r\nthat they spoke on behalf of four hundred prelates, and requested that\r\nhe would be pleased to order the question of infallibility to be\r\nimmediately brought before the Council, postponing other subjects which\r\nhad precedence. The Council itself was not able to fix even the order\r\nin which questions were to be taken up. There soon was a sign that the\r\nchange of plan thus recommended had actually been adopted. The proposed\r\nDecrees touching the duties of bishops and the life of the clergy were\r\nset aside; and the Decree on the shorter catechism was taken first in\r\norder. The former could well wait. The latter was really an important\r\nelement of centralization. But, it may be asked, Was not the Council in\r\npossession of a subject after it had once been proposed and discussed?\r\nThe reply must be, No, for such subjects could be withdrawn from its\r\ncognizance at any moment without its leave.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were the minority aware of the intention to take the\r\ndiscussion on infallibility out of its order, than they resolved\r\non sending a solemn deputation direct to the Pope to make urgent\r\nrepresentations. Purcell, Archbishop of Cincinnati, was to be the\r\nspokesman.[385] But this movement was forestalled by one from the other\r\nside. The _Synopsis of Notes_, written by the Fathers upon the Dogma,\r\nwas suddenly distributed. This not only marked the resolution of the\r\nCuria to press forward, but it accomplished a step in the progress.\r\nEither from discouragement, or from a calculation of the futility\r\nof the step, the bishops allowed their intended deputation to fall\r\nthrough. They resorted once more to a paper protest, which was signed\r\nby sixty-six prelates.[386] The true spirit of an Oriental Court made\r\nthem conscious that a petition and a surrender were the measures of\r\nwhich they were capable. In fact, as will presently appear, they had\r\npassed the stage even of petitioning, and had come to that of hopeless\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\nAs if to console themselves by strong words for doing nothing, they\r\nrecalled the fact that as soon as the _Civiltá_ hinted that the work\r\nof the Council was to be the proclamation of infallibility, all the\r\nenemies of the Church had exclaimed that the Holy Father, after having\r\nmade a pretext of the general good, had really convoked the bishops for\r\nhis own exaltation. This they had then treated as a calumny. But if the\r\nweighty matters already laid before the Council were to be put aside,\r\nand nothing was to result from their labours during six or seven months\r\nbut the one Decree already adopted, with the second now proposed on\r\ninfallibility, they would find on returning home that those calumnies\r\nagainst the Church would have acquired life and force such as they\r\ncould not contemplate without deep sorrow.\r\n\r\nThe sixty-six bishops formally announce that they do _not make any\r\nrequest_. They simply state their convictions. Again, to prefer\r\nrequests would, they feel, be no longer consistent with their episcopal\r\ndignity, with their position, or their rights, as members of the\r\nCouncil, since they have already learned sufficiently, and more than\r\nsufficiently, by experience that any prayers of theirs are so far from\r\nbeing granted that they are not even answered.\r\n\r\n    Nothing now remains to us but to disclaim for ourselves, as far\r\n    as may be, all accountability before men, and before the dreadful\r\n    judgment-seat of God, for the ill-omened events which, beyond all\r\n    doubt, will soon arise, and indeed are already arising; and of\r\n    this our disclaimer the present document will abide the perpetual\r\n    witness.\r\n\r\n    If the Decree to be pronounced _De Ecclesia_, putting aside\r\n    controverted points, aimed only at displaying to the eyes of all\r\n    men the beauty and majesty of the Spouse of Christ to the greater\r\n    glory of God and the salvation of souls, how easily might we set\r\n    forth the whole of the doctrine of the Church; and, perhaps, we\r\n    might all on the approaching festival of Pentecost, wherein the\r\n    foundation of the Church is annually called to mind, celebrate it\r\n    together. Then indeed would a right solemn Pentecost shine upon our\r\n    Synod, whereof the splendour streaming over the entire world would\r\n    fill all Christians with mighty gladness. But, alas! so far is such\r\n    gladness from being granted to us, that it would appear that on\r\n    the approaching Pentecost we must look forward rather to a day of\r\n    mourning than to one of joy. The accountability for this would rest\r\n    on those who--no necessity of the Christian commonwealth demanding\r\n    it--would, by means of the Council, wave the victor's palm because\r\n    certain opinions of the schools had triumphed, not over the enemies\r\n    of the Church, but over brothers, and who would thus inflict the\r\n    gravest injury upon the Church; injury which, both at the present\r\n    time and in view of the circumstances of future times, would give\r\n    cause for abiding fear and pain of heart.\r\n\r\n    May it please the almighty and merciful God to avert so great an\r\n    evil from the Vatican Council, and to lead us all by His heavenly\r\n    grace to a sense of true concord and unity!\r\n\r\nAmong those who sign are Prague, Munich, Colocza, Cologne, St. Gall,\r\nMaintz, Halifax, Clifton, St. Louis, Paris, St. Augustine in Florida,\r\nCincinnati, Chatham, Plymouth, Kerry, Milan, and Sault St. Marie in\r\nMichigan.\r\n\r\nFor us it is hard to account for the fact that language so strong, from\r\nmen representing interests so large, should be deemed not even worthy\r\nof the courtesy of an answer. Why did the bishops not go to the Pope\r\ndirectly?\r\n\r\n    \"Sad as it is to confess it,\" says _La Liberté du Concile_, \"the\r\n    Pope does not easily grant audiences to bishops of the minority.\r\n    Many have been expressly solicited, as to which up to this hour no\r\n    reply has been received. We know several of the oldest and most\r\n    respected bishops of France, who have been six months in Rome, and\r\n    have not yet been admitted to the presence of the Pope. Of those\r\n    who have been admitted, to none, with two or three exceptions, has\r\n    the Pope given any opening for conversation on the concerns of the\r\n    Church, or for exchanging a single word with the Holy Father on the\r\n    position of affairs.\"[387]\r\n\r\nQuirinus represents the Roman prelates as saying that the German\r\nbishops at Fulda had already showed that they felt how unity was to\r\nbe preferred to veracity. Thus the Curia had implicit faith in the\r\nfeebleness of conviction, compared with the force of the habit of\r\nsubmission. Only two things would they have feared--a schism on the\r\npart of the bishops, or a separation of the Church from the State on\r\nthe part of the politicians. But they confidently reckoned on the\r\nsubmission of the one, and on the political calculations of the other.\r\n\r\nThe pretext that all the objections to infallibility related only to\r\nopportuneness, had been gradually dropped. In fact, neither side could\r\nkeep it up, even before the public. It was possible to conceal most of\r\nthe speeches, and to deny everything that was reported of them; and\r\nit was hoped that the secret petitions would never see the light, but\r\ntracts and pamphlets could not be so readily hidden. So the Jesuits at\r\nlast boldly turned round and accused the opponents of attacking the\r\ndoctrine itself. _Observationes Quædem de Infallibilitatis Ecclesiæ\r\nSubjecto_ is the title of one publication, in treating of which the\r\n_Civiltá_ said that opportuneness no longer related to the character of\r\nthe times, but to the character of the doctrine. The doctrine itself\r\nwas declared to be alien from Catholic tradition,--a new doctrine, and\r\nconsequently a false one.[388] Ketteler had brought a pamphlet to Rome,\r\nin Latin, composed under his authority. It was long detained by the\r\npolice, but, after vexatious delays, was released. One of the things\r\nwhich exposed him to the charge of being double-faced was the fact that\r\nhe \"hawked\" this pamphlet about among the bishops, and yet said that it\r\nattacked only the opportuneness of the definition.[389] Hefele said,\r\n\"You are a Rhine Frank, and the Rhine Franks are clever people. I am\r\nonly a Swabian, and I cannot see it.\"\r\n\r\nAs Bishops Krementz and Namszanowski left Friedrich on April 25, they\r\nmet Bishop Martin. He told them with delight how the King of Prussia,\r\ntheir own monarch, had written to his ambassador not to trouble himself\r\nfurther with the decisions of the Council. Martin extolled the king to\r\nthe skies, and declared that he would now make a Prussian Propaganda.\r\nBut Namszanowski replied, \"If that is your idea, you are greatly\r\nmistaken. The king at first believed that in Rome one had to do with\r\nreasonable and sensible men; but now, seeing that he was misled, he\r\nsays, \"Do what you like, and we shall let you do it quietly. If you\r\nadopt conclusions which are injurious to us, we shall draw the sword.\"\r\nThat is the language which the consciousness of power inspires.\"[390]\r\n\r\nThe Congregation of April 29 was occupied in discussing the Decree on\r\nthe Catechism. Hefele read a speech of Rauscher. The Cardinal affirmed\r\nthat, according to the Concordat, the Catechism in Austria could not be\r\nchanged without the consent of the government. He demanded therefore\r\nthat the new Catechism should not be declared obligatory. The majority\r\nburst out into loud laughter. Hefele looked firmly and indignantly\r\nat the disturbers. The noise ceased, and he proceeded. A second time\r\nthe laughter occurred. At the conclusion, he went to the Presidents\r\nand complained. One of them observed that as a historian he must know\r\nthat even at Trent there had been interruptions. Yes, he said, but he\r\ndid not know that interruptions were essential to a Council; and he\r\nwould call attention to the fact that such proceedings would cause\r\nthe freedom of the Council to be called in question, and possibly its\r\noecumenicity.[391]\r\n\r\nOn May 2, as afterwards appeared by a letter found among papers in the\r\nTuileries, Darboy was writing to Napoleon III stating that the minority\r\nwas compact, would do its utmost, and did not despair of victory. On\r\nMay 4 the Council came to a vote on the Catechism, when as many as a\r\nhundred voted _Non placet_. Then occurred a recess of several days;\r\nbut twenty-four French bishops put in that day a protest against\r\narbitrary violations of those very Rules which had been imposed upon\r\nthe Council by the Pope himself. In the late public session the Rule\r\nthat non-members should be excluded during the legislative acts had\r\nbeen departed from without the Council being consulted. Further, this\r\nday, they add, when the votes on various amendments to the Decree on\r\nthe Catechism had been taken, the Rule required that the vote on the\r\nwhole should be deferred to another day. But, against the Rule, it was\r\ntaken on the spot. Several Fathers, who had counted that the Rule\r\nwould be kept, were absent. It is further alleged that no opportunity\r\nof pointing out these irregularities was given; because, say they,\r\ncontrary to the rule of all deliberative bodies, it is not allowed in\r\nthe Council to speak even to order, unless the name of the speaker\r\nhas been inscribed the day before, which of course is impossible in\r\nunforeseen circumstances.[392]\r\n\r\nDuring the recess the Fathers could study the contents of the notes on\r\ninfallibility. The Synopsis of them, as we have already mentioned, had\r\nbeen put into their hands. Some of these notes are printed entire, some\r\nare abridged; but there does not appear to have been much complaint\r\nthat this was unfairly done. The two sides were represented by about\r\nan equal number of memoranda. The Synopsis contained two hundred and\r\nforty-two pages, consisting of one hundred and thirty-nine memoranda.\r\nSixty-five of these were adverse to the definition. Of these, again,\r\nonly thirteen advanced merely the plea of inopportuneness, and\r\nfifty-two opposed the doctrine itself. Yet Cardinal Manning never heard\r\nof five bishops who denied the doctrine of Papal infallibility![393]\r\n\r\nAdepts readily traced many of the anonymous memoranda to their authors,\r\nand, of course, the authors frequently acknowledged their handiwork.\r\nThe first memorandum was by Rauscher, the last by Kenrick--two men who\r\nshowed as much capacity as any of the minority. In these notes, the\r\nstudent will find a real source of light on the thoughts and principles\r\nwhich were then common to all men convened to reconstitute human\r\nsociety, as well as on those in which they disagreed.[394] They are\r\nalmost the only portion of the proceedings which have real interest\r\nfor the pure theologian. Attempts have been made since the Council, by\r\nmany bishops, to represent the whole amount of difference of opinion\r\nas having been a trifle, touching only the question of opportuneness.\r\nThe character of those statements is sealed by these notes. We shall\r\nnot attempt to give a general outline of them; but the very first\r\nmemorandum, that of Rauscher, is perfectly explicit. He immediately\r\nhandles the doctrine, not the prudence or expedience of proclaiming it.\r\nIt was fair to treat an objector like Dr. Newman as opposing on grounds\r\nnot either theological or moral, but from subtle expediency. Such\r\nmen were simply afraid of hurting the credit of their Church, though\r\nadmitting that the claims she advanced were warranted. They counselled\r\na reserve which would have been thought natural for Italians, but\r\nimpossible for Englishmen, before the time when Dr. Newman's power of\r\nmaking the flow of our mother tongue smooth and winning began to be\r\nused, in order to rob it of its good name for straightforwardness. But\r\nRauscher showed cause. He declared that it had never yet been proved\r\nthat the alleged authority which the new claims professed to formulate,\r\nhad any existence. He declared that the attempts made to prove it were\r\npartly artifices and partly fallacies. Two positions so distinct as\r\nthis simple one of Rauscher and the double one of Newman could not be\r\nconfounded, even by men much less apt at splitting hairs than Roman\r\nCatholic bishops.\r\n\r\n\"The subterfuges,\" indignantly writes Rauscher in his first paragraph,\r\nafter alluding to the necessity, under which he lay in Germany, of\r\nshowing reasons, and tacitly contrasting such a position with the\r\nfacility of demanding submission in Rome,--\"The subterfuges employed\r\nby not a few theologians in the matter of Honorius, would expose me to\r\nderision. To employ sophisms seems to me unworthy both of the dignity\r\nof a bishop and of the nature of the subject, which ought to be treated\r\nin the fear of God; but prudence itself would put me on my guard\r\nagainst artifices.\" What a testimony! delivered in the face of Rome at\r\nthat moment, it showed the effect of free enquiry in compelling men to\r\nbe truthful, as compared with the effect of what Rome calls \"authority\"\r\nin making them first supple and then deceitful. It is a testimony of\r\npermanent value in the three spheres of history, morals, and theology.\r\n\r\nHis next blow is at a logical trick, which, however, is one employed\r\nby Roman Catholic theologians at almost every step in their attempt\r\nto prove Romanist as distinguished from Christian doctrine--the trick\r\nof begging the question. It is inferred that the Decrees of the\r\nPope, in matters of faith and morals, must be infallible, because the\r\npower of legislation in faith and morals for the whole Church having\r\nbeen conferred on Peter and his successors, it is clear that what\r\nwas false could not be allowed to enter into such Decrees. Very good\r\nsays Rauscher; but this is calling the thing to be proved to give\r\nevidence for the thing to be proved. The question turns on the very\r\npoint whether any such power of universal legislation, in faith or\r\nmorals, without appeal or revision, ever was conferred on Peter and his\r\nsuccessors. Even here Rauscher assumes as proved what is altogether\r\nincapable of proof, that the Roman Pontiff is the successor of Peter.\r\nThat Peter ever was in Rome is not proven; that he ever was Pontiff is\r\nabsurd; that he ever was the Christian bishop of the city admits of\r\nscarcely a show of proof, except on those principles of evidence which\r\nhave been naturalized in Romish theology by the necessity of supporting\r\nfables and forgeries.\r\n\r\nNot only do men like Rauscher show that they dispute the doctrine\r\nitself, but the memoranda of many who commence by alleging\r\ninopportuneness, end by attacking the substance of the doctrine. For\r\ninstance, No. 136 says, \"Finally, I cannot find this infallibility in\r\nthe acts of the General Councils. On the other hand, it is certain that\r\nthree General Councils condemned Honorius for heresy.\" Yet this prelate\r\nseemed, in his first sentences, only to oppose the opportuneness of\r\nthe definition. Kenrick takes the opposite course. He begins by saying\r\nthat the doctrine is not so certain that it can be defined as an\r\narticle of faith, and then takes up lower ground, that, even if it were\r\ncertain, it would not be expedient that it should be defined by the\r\npresent Council. We do not wonder at any man who could put upon paper\r\nthe last principle, submitting to anything, or concealing anything, or\r\nprofessing anything, if it is expedient. What, it may be true that, on\r\nearth, God has set up a man as His representative who, whenever he puts\r\non his full official character, utters the Word of God without error\r\nor possibility of erring, and yet it may not be expedient to tell this\r\nmost pregnant of truths by any and every organ possible! How can any\r\nmoral foundations exist in men whose whole substance is honeycombed by\r\nprinciples like these? When they submit, their submission has not the\r\ngrace of any real sacrifice. When they affirm, their affirmation has\r\nnot the authority of any real conviction.\r\n\r\nThis moral obscurity does not prevent Kenrick from clearly seeing\r\ntheological points. He boldly says that the doctrine expressed in the\r\nproposed definition is wanting in authority both from Scripture and\r\nfrom ecclesiastical tradition. We shall not enter into his examination\r\nof the alleged scriptural proofs, but it is well worth the attention\r\nof theologians. He clearly puts the retrospective and prospective\r\naspects of the new dogma, when contrasting it with an ordinary point of\r\ndoctrine like that of the Immaculate Conception--\r\n\r\n    The new dogma not only impairs the rights of bishops, but imposes\r\n    on the faithful the necessity of believing that the Roman Pontiffs\r\n    never did err in faith, which indubitable monuments of history seem\r\n    to disprove; and that they never will err in the future, which we\r\n    hope, but are not able to believe with the certitude of divine\r\n    faith.[395]\r\n\r\nKenrick says that, in defining the Immaculate Conception the Pope\r\nproposed the greater glory of the Mother of God, and previously to\r\ndoing so consulted all the bishops, and acted on their advice. Now,\r\nhowever, he proposed his own infallibility, to be defined by a Council,\r\nwhich seems to have been convened for that purpose, although many\r\nbishops, and those representing the principal Churches of the Christian\r\nworld, do not approve of it either in itself or in its concomitants.\r\n\r\nKenrick embraces under the head of expediency matter very different\r\nindeed from what one would have anticipated. He barely indicates the\r\nsocial and political dangers likely to arise out of the contemplated\r\nchanges in dogma and polity. Having done this, he at once declares that\r\nthe authority and oecumenicity of the Council are liable to be called\r\nin question, and will be called in question, on two separate grounds:\r\nfirst, the composition of the Council, and, secondly, its defect of\r\nliberty. As to its composition, he divides the members of it into five\r\nclasses--\r\n\r\n1. Diocesan bishops having Sees and governing them by ordinary\r\nepiscopal authority.\r\n\r\n2. Bishops of the _Ring_--_episcopi annulares_--who have the orders\r\nof bishops, but have neither Sees nor flocks, and who, with few\r\nexceptions, hold offices in the Court of Rome.\r\n\r\n3. Other bishops _in partibus_, who, under the designation of Vicars\r\nApostolic, preside over missions, and are all of them so immediately\r\ndependent upon the Holy See as to be removable at the discretion of the\r\nPope.\r\n\r\n4. Cardinals who are not bishops, and Cardinals who, having the orders\r\nof bishops, have no Sees.\r\n\r\n5. Abbots and Generals of Orders.\r\n\r\nKenrick asserts that out of all the five classes the right of\r\ndefinition in matters of faith belongs, by a certain and universally\r\nacknowledged title, to diocesan bishops alone. The right of the Bishops\r\nof the Ring to define in matters of faith is a subject of dispute among\r\ntheologians. The right of the Vicars Apostolic is disputable, but on\r\ndifferent grounds. They have Sees, yet they are immediately dependent\r\non the See of Rome, even to the extent of being removable at the will\r\nof the Bishop of Rome. As to Cardinals who are not bishops, with the\r\nAbbots and Generals, there is no doubt. They are confessed by all to\r\nhave no right of definition in matters of faith, except as derived from\r\ncustom.\r\n\r\nHaving thus described the composition of the Council, he adds the\r\nfollowing solemn words--\r\n\r\n    In this Council the subject in hand affects the conflicting claims\r\n    of the Pope and the bishops. If the Pope alone is infallible, the\r\n    bishops do not exercise the office of judges, and, in a Council,\r\n    they are only his councillors. Hence it ought to belong not to the\r\n    Pope singly, but to a Council of diocesan bishops presided over by\r\n    the Pope, to determine what right properly belongs to the other\r\n    four classes; for otherwise the Pope would seem to dominate the\r\n    Council.\r\n\r\nHow that argument to prove that the proper constitution of a Council\r\nwas violated at the Vatican is to be met, it is not easy to see. The\r\npoint next touched by Kenrick is one that has been less dwelt upon in\r\npublic, but which would probably have some weight in a legal argument.\r\nIn the Bull of Convocation it was enjoined upon bishops who should\r\nnot be able to attend, to send their deputies furnished with proper\r\ncredentials. Forty such deputies actually presented themselves; they\r\nwere refused admittance, not by the Council, but by the Pope acting\r\nalone! Now, insists Kenrick, diocesan bishops would appear to have a\r\nstrict right to send deputies to the Council when themselves unable\r\nto attend, which right was recognised by the ancient Councils. The\r\nexclusion, therefore, of those deputies from the Vatican Council _by\r\nthe sole authority of the Pontiff_, would seem to raise a doubt of\r\nits oecumenicity. Had there been any question as to their title, it\r\nbelonged to the Council itself to determine, but permission was not\r\ngiven to take the opinion of the Council on the point!\r\n\r\nKenrick further specifies, as a blot upon the authority and\r\noecumenicity of the Council, the withdrawal from the bishops of\r\nthe right of proposition by a mere Papal constitution. He adds the\r\nimportant fact that, owing to the privation of this right, many Fathers\r\nwho wished to take the opinion of the Council on the admission of the\r\ndeputies of absent prelates were unable to do so, although they left\r\nno means untried. Yet one at least who was born an Englishman can say\r\nthat this Council was as free as our Parliament--a Council that had\r\nnot even the right of verifying the titles of its own members! Kenrick\r\nconcludes by expressing his persuasion that if the definition of Papal\r\ninfallibility should go out in the name of this Council, it would\r\nrather increase dissension than promote peace, and would lead to a\r\ndiminution of the rights of bishops and to the dishonour of the Pontiff\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe Liberal Catholics began, about this time, to notice the frequent\r\nexpressions in Curialistic circles anticipating a war, in 1871, between\r\nFrance and Prussia.[396] The _Univers_ now fixed a new date for the\r\nsettlement of the great question--Ascension Day. All that could be\r\nsaid _pro_ or _con_ had been said, according to this journal, in the\r\nmemoranda written by the prelates; and so in the Council there would be\r\nonly an exposition of the Decree prepared by the committee, after which\r\nthe Fathers would at once proceed to the vote. No doubt the avoidance\r\nof further discussion was a matter of great account with those who were\r\nlooking to the future. The effect of the new constitution, at least\r\nits immediate effect, would greatly depend upon the _éclat_ with which\r\nit should be promulged, and on the state of preparation to which the\r\nCatholic populations might be brought. If a tale of Friedrich, at the\r\nexpense of Cardinal Capalti, be anything more than a joke, the question\r\nmight have been settled by leaving it open. The Cardinal declared\r\nthat he should be content with a definition of the infallibility of\r\nthe Pope, whether it was infallibility with the bishops or without\r\nthem.[397] The circulation of such a tale illustrates an impression\r\nprevailing, that even many of those in high places had not mastered the\r\nbearings of the question in dispute.\r\n\r\nIt was on May 10 that the proposed Decrees of Infallibility were\r\ndistributed. \"I shook all over my body,\" says Friedrich; \"my senses\r\nseemed to forsake me as I read on.\" What was the amazement of the\r\nProfessor to find not only all the mediæval pretensions taken up\r\nagain, but the cool assertion made in notes, that all monuments of\r\nantiquity showed that the infallibility of the Roman Pontiff had been\r\nheld as a truth divinely revealed. Another assertion which he noted,\r\nis that infallibility could never be disproved by history; but if\r\nany historical facts did appear to conflict with it, in so far as\r\nthey did so they must be taken to be false. Again, the conclusions of\r\nany science, even those of ecclesiastical history, if opposed to the\r\ninfallibility of the Pontiff, must be held to be errors. This is a\r\nvery practical way of carrying out the principle announced by Cardinal\r\nManning as to the dogma conquering history.\r\n\r\nAfter reading this sort of matter, the indignant Professor cries,\r\n\"Will our bishops dare to return home with such a verdict against\r\nall science, and against all sound reason? Does not this amount to\r\nsaying--I believe it because it is absurd?\" The Archbishop of Bamberg\r\ngave Friedrich some light on the way in which history was to be kept\r\nright. He said that the Pope was irritated at Hefele's pamphlet on the\r\ncase of Honorius, and said, \"There must be falsification of documents.\r\nThe documents must be in the archives. Let them seek and they will find\r\nthem; I am persuaded of it.\" It was publicly announced that the Pope\r\nhad appointed two men to perform this duty. The Archbishop thought that\r\nthe Curia would shrink from facing the judgment of the world. He placed\r\nhis finger on his forehead, and said, \"I cannot understand how a man in\r\nhis senses can think of a personal infallible Pope.\" Archbishop Scherr\r\nhaving joined them, Deinlein added, \"The world must rescue us. Had it\r\nnot rescued us, we were already lost, and the Council over.\"[398] To\r\nthis Friedrich adds that Bishops Krementz and Namszanowski are already\r\nthinking of the coming excommunication; and that Hefele had said gladly\r\nwould he lay down the mitre and crozier, but what would become of his\r\ndiocese?\r\n\r\nFriedrich, wearied out in spirit, now spoke of going home. \"You must\r\nstay,\" said Bishop Namszanowski, \"for the historians must sit in\r\njudgment over this perfidious proceeding. It is impossible any longer\r\nto speak of a General Council. I only wonder that the German bishops\r\nhave not already jumped out of their skin.\"[399]\r\n\r\nOne of Friedrich's notes is to the effect that the Nuncio in Munich\r\nhaving reported that Archbishop Scherr in opposing infallibility\r\ncommanded no sympathy among his people, the Pope sent for the\r\nArchbishop, and asked him why he took the side of the minority when\r\nhe was isolated in his own diocese. The Archbishop asked Friedrich to\r\ntell Döllinger that even at this peculiar audience he had stood by\r\nhim. Still he wished Döllinger not to do anything more; it would only\r\nincrease the difficulties.[400]\r\n\r\nThe proposed Decrees on the Church were wonderfully changed. The\r\ncelebrated twenty-one Canons were now omitted. The whole Draft was\r\ncompressed into four chapters, with three Canons. Vitelleschi, as\r\nwe have seen, cannot understand how governments, especially the\r\ngovernment of France, should attach so much importance to the Canons,\r\nand so little to the dogma of infallibility. The latter, as he well\r\nsays, virtually includes them all, and as many more besides as may\r\nspring from the sole and irresponsible will of an individual. John\r\nLemoinne had hastily said that Infallibility affected France no more\r\nthan the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception; but Prévost Paradol\r\nhad, with better insight, shown that, on the contrary, it gave the\r\nPope everything in theory, and left him in the position, step by\r\nstep, first to assume and next to acquire everything in practice. The\r\nImmaculate Conception seriously affected France; not the doctrine, but\r\nthe proceeding which set up a single master over the faith of France.\r\nThat proceeding paved the way for Infallibility, which in its turn was\r\nto confirm for ever and render ordinary a despotic procedure which\r\notherwise might have been treated as exceptional.\r\n\r\nThe _Univers_ of April 29, after asking whether objectors meant to\r\nremain Catholics after the definition, and saying that if they answered\r\nNo they were judged already, went on to remark, If they answer Yes they\r\nare preparing themselves for a kind of faith and obedience that is\r\nhardly reasonable; preparing to believe that what was black has become\r\nwhite through a Council invested with power to make true that which was\r\nfalse. Poor Montalembert did not live to read that taunt and menace\r\nboth in one. Mrs. Oliphant mentions someone who said that the Count had\r\nexpressed his intention to submit at last, for he must do so. That is\r\none thing, and expressing an intention to believe is another. But those\r\nwho know how such statements as that quoted by Mrs. Oliphant are made,\r\nwould not give much for it if it came only from a female or a priest.\r\n\r\nBishop Martin related how Friedrich, as he walked on the Pincian the\r\nevening before leaving Rome, said, pointing to St. Peter's, \"If only\r\nthe lightning fell from heaven and annihilated St. Peter's with all its\r\nglories!\" \"No,\" retorted Friedrich, \"I never said anything so silly.\r\nWhat I once did say on the Pincian was, referring to the superstition\r\nof the Pope, 'Nothing can restrain the Pope from the definition,\r\nunless, indeed, at the critical moment, the well-known sunbeam fails,\r\nand some other natural phenomenon comes in its stead.'\"[401]\r\n\r\nTo understand the line of thought by which calculating men connected\r\nthe dogma with the prospect of universal dominion over the world, it is\r\nnecessary to recall the primary elements of Church jurisdiction. As a\r\nkingdom appointed to govern the world, which is the ineradicable Papal\r\nconception, the Church rules through three tribunals--the internal,\r\nthe external, and the supreme. Technically they are two, internal and\r\nexternal; the Pope being supreme in both. In the _internal tribunal_\r\nthe Church cites; the cited are all the faithful. The person appearing\r\nis himself accuser and witness; the confessor is judge and jury. This\r\ntribunal, popularly called the Confessional, rules the conscience,\r\nthe board, the bed, the purse, the family life, and the action of\r\nthe individual in public life. In the _external tribunal_ it is the\r\necclesiastical law which cites. Those cited are persons against whom\r\nany one either secretly or publicly complains. The witnesses may\r\nbe either secret informer or open witness. The judge and jury are\r\nthe ecclesiastical magistrate. This tribunal, popularly called the\r\nEcclesiastical Court, rules all social questions whatever that have\r\nany moral interest or any colourable connexion with religion. Finally,\r\nin the supreme tribunal the Curia cites. The parties cited are all\r\nagainst whom any appeal or any information has been laid. The witnesses\r\nare those whom the Curia chooses to call, or its informers. The Pope\r\nis judge and jury. This tribunal, popularly called the Pope, acting\r\nthrough some Roman congregation or court, settles all points as between\r\nconfessor and penitent, as between priest and bishop, as between\r\nmagistrates and parties to a process, as between rulers and subjects,\r\nas between State and State, and above all, as between any State with\r\nits ruler and the supreme tribunal.\r\n\r\nThese three tribunals between them give a complete control of the\r\ntangled web called the world, excepting only that ill-defined if not\r\ninvisible selvage of it which consists of affairs not included within\r\nthe domain of morals. And that web, with its cunning shots and all but\r\ninvisible devices, is that \"large and variegated web,\" which, when\r\nunfolding its program, the _Civiltá_ showed, would, after lustres had\r\ncome and gone, appear as the fabric woven with the simple threads of\r\nits title, _Catholic Civilization_; or the Catholic Civil System.\r\n\r\nNow, in the chaotic condition of recent times, President Moreno\r\nand Queen Isabella were the only two rulers that even seemed to be\r\ndutifully disposed to the Church in her tribunals; and poor Queen\r\nIsabella had already fallen.\r\n\r\nIn most countries, one who never entered the internal tribunal, might\r\nconduct a business, indeed he might even write a newspaper, or fill a\r\nprofessor's chair, ay, might make laws, or occupy a throne. Hence the\r\ncrying need of a central authority so strong as to give to the external\r\ntribunal control over every bench, and to make the internal bear rule\r\nin every home, especially in every home wherein dwelt a ruler.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation of infallibility would be a complete restoration of\r\nthe supreme tribunal, not indeed as to all the facts, but complete\r\nas to the ideas. This would bring about the restoration of facts in\r\ntime. It is plain that the great majority of the bishops calculated\r\nhew the supreme judge, when once enthroned and acknowledged, would awe\r\nwayward kings and politicians; how, waiting for favourable political\r\nconjunctures, Nuncios would be able to move the bishops, and the\r\nbishops the clergy, and the clergy the people, till the patient power\r\nof the Church would bow all to her own laws. The hold already acquired\r\nupon schools, especially in France, was the most solid element in the\r\nentire calculation. The progress made within the last thirty years held\r\nout flattering hopes as to the future. The architects forgot that they\r\nhad climbed up by a ladder which they had now kicked away. The voice\r\nto which concessions had been made was that of the Liberal Catholics\r\npleading in the name of liberty, and they and their plea had now been\r\nunblushingly disowned.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 382: _Quirinus_, p. 482.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 383: _Quirinus_, p. 253.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 384: \"What stupefaction to think that perhaps serious men\r\nhave been engaged in getting these things written about themselves!\"\r\n(vol. ii. 125).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 385: _Quirinus_, p. 508.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 386: _Quirinus_ says by seventy-seven; but we give the\r\nnumbers as we count them at the foot of the document in the _Documenta\r\nad Illustrandum_, ii. p. 392.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 387: _Doc. ad Ill._, i. 178.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 388: Serie VII. x. p. 291.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 389: Printed in _Documenta ad Ill._, i. p. 1-129.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 390: _Tagebuch_, p. 365.

This conflict was to be\r\nthe death of real parliamentary debating in all countries. It ranged\r\nover the whole Draft of the proposed Decrees. The scope of them is well\r\nindicated by M. Veuillot, when he calls the Draft the _Schema_ of the\r\nPontiff. It treats only of primacy and infallibility. The first chapter\r\ntreats of the institution of primacy in the person of Peter; the second\r\ntreats of its descent through the Roman Pontiffs; the third, of its\r\nnature and scope; the fourth, of Papal infallibility.\r\n\r\nBishop Pie, of Poitiers, opened this famous field by a discourse\r\nmuch praised and much ridiculed. He argued for infallibility on the\r\nground that Providence permitted St. Paul to be beheaded, and not St.\r\nPeter,[402] and on the further ground that Peter was crucified with the\r\nhead downwards, to show that the body was to be supported by the head;\r\nbut he who supports is infallible, and not he who is supported.[403]\r\nThis truly Romish argument evoked, as Vitelleschi intimates, from the\r\nmajority enthusiasm, and from the Opposition sarcastic smiles. We do\r\nnot know whether any divine put before Bishop Pie the difficulty thrown\r\nin the way of his argument, by the fact that Providence must have\r\npermitted Peter to be beheaded after death, seeing that his head was\r\nwith that of Paul in the Lateran, and only his trunk in St. Peter's.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, no less a person than the Cardinal Vicar ascended the\r\ntribune to plead for the glory of his chief. By a leap from centre to\r\ncircumference, he was followed by the Archbishop of St. Francisco. The\r\nArchbishop of Messina relieved the gravity of the debate by relating\r\nhow Peter had preached in Sicily; but when he told the people that he\r\nwas infallible they doubted. They, however, sent an embassy to the\r\nVirgin Mary, to ask if she had heard of the infallibility of Peter. The\r\nVirgin replied that she certainly remembered being present when her Son\r\nconferred this prerogative upon him.[404] This speech has caused some\r\ncorrespondence in the Italian papers, especially touching the letter of\r\nthe Virgin, which is still in existence, and has an annual feast all\r\nto itself. Somehow we are not ourselves clear as to the history of the\r\nembassy and of the letter. It is said that the letter was let down from\r\nheaven by the Virgin; but if that be so, where did the ambassadors go\r\nto with their message? But as the events took place before the age of\r\nreconstruction, we shall not digress further.\r\n\r\nThe discussion proceeded from day to day, a long and increasing\r\nlist of names promising endless speeches. Three Cardinals spoke on\r\nMay 18--Schwarzenberg, Rauscher, and Donnet, Vitelleschi reports\r\nSchwarzenberg as having said (p. 159), \"It is said that you really\r\nbelieve in this dogma; but, if that be true, you cannot insist that I\r\nand my companions ought to acknowledge what seems to us absurd; and if\r\nyou do insist, be sure that schisms will arise, and abjurations will\r\nfollow within the Church of Rome.\" On May 19 the pulpit was ascended by\r\nCardinal Cullen, carrying with him the confidence of power in Ireland,\r\nand of favour with the Curia. Coming of \"a right noble Irish family,\"\r\nas the official history says,[405] and trained after the heart of the\r\nCuria, he had well justified their expectations in carrying out the\r\ncentralizing system, to which he owed his mitre. He addressed himself\r\nparticularly to the task of refuting Hefele's pamphlet on the heresy\r\nof Pope Honorius, contending that it could not be reconciled with what\r\nthat prelate had written in his history of Councils.[406] But he also\r\nattacked Kenrick for his memorandum already spoken of. He charged the\r\nlatter with impairing the argument for the primacy of the Pope, by\r\nasserting that the other apostles were also called foundations as well\r\nas Peter. Furthermore, Kenrick had asserted that the words \"lambs\" and\r\n\"sheep\" in the Vulgate (John xxi. 16, 17) both stood for one and the\r\nsame Greek word, and hence he had contended that the stock Curialistic\r\nargument, that the bishops, \"sheep,\" are placed under the Pope as well\r\nas the people, \"lambs,\" had actually not even the show of a foundation\r\nin the passage. This was a sore point, for what would the Papal system\r\nhave done before infallibility was proclaimed without this passage?\r\nIt was as important as \"Obey God rather than man,\" or as \"Teach all\r\nnations.\" _It is not true_, asserted Cullen, that the two Latin words\r\nin those verses represent one and the same Greek word in the original.\r\nHe quoted Oriental versions. _It is not true_, he repeated, with\r\nemphasis.\r\n\r\nAs to the word \"faith,\" a word which Rome has, like so many others,\r\nkilled, disembowelled, and embalmed, Kenrick had asserted that our Lord\r\nnever employed it as meaning a _body of doctrine_, and that He employed\r\nit not more than once or twice as meaning the act by which we believe\r\nin God as revealing Himself; but that He generally employed it as\r\nmeaning trust or confidence. This, Kenrick had asserted, was the sense\r\nof the word in the passage on which the attempt was made to build the\r\ninfallibility of all dogmas found in the Decrees of the Roman Pontiff.\r\nThe words are, \"I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not.\" That\r\nis, our Lord had prayed that the trust and confidence of Peter should\r\nnot entirely fail; and Rome argued that He thereby promised that\r\neverything in the Decrees of the Roman Pontiffs, affecting doctrine or\r\nmorals, should be for evermore free from error. Kenrick's exposition\r\nof what our Lord really did say made this argument appear not only\r\nfutile but unfair. Cullen met him by declaring that his views savoured\r\nof the Calvinian heresy. The Cardinal proceeded to deny that bishops,\r\nas successors of the apostles, possessed that universal jurisdiction\r\nin the Church which the apostles themselves had received from Christ.\r\nHe quoted a work of a deceased brother of Kenrick, formerly Archbishop\r\nof Baltimore, on the Primacy of the Apostolic See. Cullen, moreover,\r\nclaimed Ireland and the Irish for infallibility in the teeth of\r\noaths, catechisms, records, and living memories. In doing so, he was\r\nindiscreet enough to name, as on his side, MacHale, the lion of St.\r\nJarlath, who had sat silent under the weight of his nearly fourscore\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nKenrick, feeling that Cullen had said things which touched his\r\nhonour,[407] prayed for leave to reply, either at once or at the end\r\nof the sitting. This was refused. Archbishops must wait till all the\r\nCardinals who chose to speak had spoken, and Kenrick must wait till all\r\narchbishops senior to himself had been heard. He prepared a speech, but\r\nthe debate was cut short before he had the opportunity of delivering\r\nit. Thereupon he resorted to the expedient of printing. To this\r\ndocument we are indebted for some of our most trustworthy information\r\nas to the real position taken up by different speakers.[408]\r\n\r\nKenrick said that Cullen had, in very severe language, charged him with\r\nimpairing the argument for the primacy of the Pontiff, by alleging\r\nthat the other apostles were called foundations as well as Peter.\r\nThat, however, was not his language, but must be laid at the door\r\nof the \"divine\" Paul and John. Kenrick admitted primacy, but denied\r\ninfallibility. He also denied that Christ had made the stability of\r\nthe Church dependent on Peter as the foundation. He had provided\r\nfor her stability otherwise, by saying. \"Lo, I am with you always,\r\neven unto the end of the world.\" Cullen had further said, and that\r\nrepeatedly and with much energy of expression, It is false, because\r\nKenrick asserted that one and the same Greek word was translated both\r\n\"sheep\" and \"lambs\" in the sixteenth and seventeenth verses of John\r\nxxi. But, in so doing, replied Kenrick, the Cardinal had betrayed a\r\nlittle infirmity.[409] The fact remained, that in those two verses the\r\nVulgate did translate one and the same Greek word by two Latin ones.\r\nMoreover, in the reading adopted by Tischendorf, there was no word in\r\nany of the three utterances of our Lord which properly represented the\r\nword \"sheep\"; and the reading adopted by Tischendorf was confirmed by\r\nthat which they might see inscribed on the arch of the Vatican Church,\r\nover the throne of the Pontiff.[410] In answer to the assertion of\r\nthe Cardinal, that his exposition of the meaning of the word \"faith\"\r\nsavoured of the Calvinian heresy, Kenrick said that perhaps his\r\nEminence had not weighed the full significance of such language. He\r\nshowed that out of twenty-nine places in the Gospels where the word\r\noccurred, in all but two it clearly meant confidence, or else the faith\r\nthat works miracles; and that in only two could it be taken for the\r\ntheological virtue of believing in God's revelation of Himself. He was\r\nstill fully persuaded that its real meaning, in the words addressed by\r\nour Lord to Peter, was that of trust or confidence.\r\n\r\nBut Kenrick contended that Cullen had, by his own method of reasoning,\r\ntaken away all the force usually ascribed by theologians to the words,\r\n\"Thou art Peter.\" He had said that the privileges given to the other\r\napostles by our Lord did not descend to their successors. If that was\r\nthe case with the other apostles, surely it would be also the case with\r\nPeter. Kenrick, however, firmly contended that apostolic authority did\r\nnot emanate from the Pontiff, but was given to the bishops by Christ\r\nHimself, and that the restriction of it to certain localities was\r\nmerely by appointment of the Church.\r\n\r\nAfter showing that the interpretation of the words \"Upon this rock,\"\r\nwhich was supported by the greatest number of the Fathers, was that\r\nwhich regards the faith declared in the Confession of Peter as the\r\nfoundation on which the Church was to be built, he pointed out that\r\nthe word \"foundation\" has two clearly distinguished and well-defined\r\nmeanings. First, the natural foundation, or that to which a wise\r\nbuilder clears his way before laying a stone--the living rock.\r\nSecondly, the architectural foundation, namely, the first course of\r\nstones laid on this rock. He contended that attention to this simple\r\nfact made the language of both classes of passages perfectly clear;\r\nthose in which our Lord alone is called the Foundation, and those in\r\nwhich the apostles are so called. At the same time it cut away all the\r\nground on which an argument in favour of the infallibility of the Roman\r\nPontiff is built, because he is the foundation of the Church.\r\n\r\nAs to the testimony of the Church with regard to the proposed dogma,\r\nKenrick states it thus--\r\n\r\n    The dogma is not contained in the creeds; it is not given in the\r\n    Catechisms as an article of faith; it is not found as such in any\r\n    monument of public worship. Therefore the Church has not heretofore\r\n    taught it as being of the faith; and had it been a doctrine of\r\n    faith, she ought to have taught it, and to have handed it down.\r\n\r\n    Not only has the Church not taught it in any public standard, but\r\n    she has permitted it to be impugned, and not in one place alone,\r\n    but in almost all the world, Italy excepted, and that throughout\r\n    a great length of time.... To speak of the nations which use the\r\n    English tongue, in no one standard or catechetical book of theirs\r\n    is this opinion enumerated among the verities that are of faith. In\r\n    the United States, as in Ireland, all books of piety and doctrine\r\n    were drawn from England till the opening of this century, and\r\n    later. In the greater part of those books, the opposite opinion is\r\n    contained. In none is this opinion found as being of faith (p. 212).\r\n\r\nHe shows that recently a few books had appeared as if to prepare the\r\npeople for the new dogma. Alluding evidently to the work of the Jesuit\r\nWeninger, which the Pope had praised, he calls the author a zealous but\r\nunlearned man, and says his work was more calculated to excite ridicule\r\nthan anger, and that when the author had applied to himself for some\r\ncommendation, he had incautiously promised him the charity of silence.\r\n\r\nAs to the use made by Cullen of his brother's work, he said he had\r\nfelt as if the dead had been commended in order to rebuke the living.\r\nAs to the faith of the Irish, he remarked that a smile had been raised\r\nwhen Verot, of Augustine, in Florida, said that the Irish believed\r\neven their priests to be infallible. But it was true, for believing\r\nthe Church to be infallible, and the priest to be in harmony with the\r\nChurch, they believed him to be infallible, and with the difference of\r\nhis more exalted rank, it was precisely in the same sense that they\r\nbelieved the Pope to be infallible. But as to their understanding the\r\nquestion now agitated, or being able to form an opinion concerning it,\r\nthat was too ridiculous to need confutation (p. 216). He even doubted\r\nif a meeting in Cork, over which the bishop of the see was said to have\r\npresided, had understood the question; and indeed it was apparent, from\r\nwhat had passed in that Hall, that there were bishops there who were\r\nnot clear as to what Papal infallibility meant.\r\n\r\nTurning from the populace of Ireland to the prelates and doctors, he\r\nwas ready to grant that now, influenced by some distinguished names,\r\nthe preponderating opinion might be in favour of Papal infallibility;\r\non that point, however, he knew nothing more than what he had been\r\nable to learn since coming to Rome. But in the beginning it was not\r\nso. His proof of this was the almost universal applause with which the\r\nwritings of Dr. Doyle had been received, and those of the Rev. Arthur\r\nO'Leary. Further, he cited answers given to a committee of the British\r\nParliament in 1825 by the Archbishops of Dublin and Tuam, Murray and\r\nO'Kelly, as well as by Bishop Doyle. These answers he printed with his\r\nspeech, both in the original English and in a Latin translation. He\r\nfurther cited a manifesto of all the Irish bishops in the year 1815,\r\naddressed directly to the Holy See, which clearly shows that they did\r\nnot hold the views embodied in the proposed Decrees. He prints this\r\ndocument also.\r\n\r\nNext, passing from the Irish prelates to the priests, Kenrick\r\nconfidently affirms that they in former times did not differ from\r\nthe prelates. Long after the establishment of Maynooth College, the\r\nprofessors, he declares, came from France, and their treatises were in\r\nthe hands of the pupils long subsequently to their own death. He calls\r\nthe Archbishop of Cashel as a witness, while he relates how the change\r\nof teaching was first introduced in that college. They were there\r\nat the time as fellow-students. Forty years ago, says Kenrick, John\r\nO'Hanlon was Tutor in Theology, as he is now Moderator of the higher\r\ntheological sciences in the college. The text-book _De Ecclesia_ at\r\nthat time was _Delahogue_. It contained nothing, says Kenrick, about\r\nPapal infallibility, except a proposition in these or similar words,\r\n\"It is not of faith that the Pope is infallible\" (p. 218).\r\n\r\nIn the year 1831, O'Hanlon gave his pupils, as a theme, the following\r\nproposition: \"The Pope, speaking _ex cathedrâ_, is infallible.\"\r\nO'Hanlon did not indicate any opinion of his own, and did not urge\r\nthe pupils in discussing the thesis to take either one side or the\r\nother, but left them to argue for the negative or affirmative at their\r\ndiscretion. Kenrick was one of those who took the affirmative; but he\r\nadds, Language _so new, and hitherto unheard_ of, did not please all\r\nthe professors. One of them, who subsequently became President of the\r\ncollege, strongly expressed his dissatisfaction to my fellow-student,\r\nnow the Bishop of Clonfert, from whom I had the statement. Kenrick\r\nthen makes a confident appeal to MacHale, to whom Cullen had made a\r\npresumptuous one--\r\n\r\n    There sits here a venerable man, who many years ere I entered\r\n    that college expounded theology within its walls, who is by good\r\n    right looked upon as the Nestor of the Irish bishops, for he has\r\n    lived with almost three generations of men; one who with eminent\r\n    theological learning combined a glory of classic lore, and also\r\n    had intimate acquaintance with the prelates whom I have cited, and\r\n    with other men of learning whose bright and venerable names are\r\n    inscribed on the hearts of the Irish, and among their glories....\r\n    He, with rare moderation, had not given expression to his views on\r\n    the matter now under discussion. So that his Eminence of Dublin\r\n    did not hesitate to speak for him, and to claim him as being upon\r\n    his own side. Those who feel with me, and who had known him,\r\n    desiring to see him contending by our side, were grieved to behold\r\n    him sitting apart like another Achilles. I was filled, therefore,\r\n    with an unlooked-for joy when I heard him say that in judgments on\r\n    matters of faith the head ought to be conjoined with the body; not,\r\n    as his Grace of Westminster would have it, that the head of itself,\r\n    communicating infallibility to itself, should draw the body along\r\n    with it, but that head and body, conjointly bearing witness to the\r\n    faith delivered to the saints, should declare it with one mind. As\r\n    the Archbishop of Tuam descended from this pulpit, I congratulated\r\n    him in these words: 'You have vindicated Ireland--_Vindicasti\r\n    Hiberniam_.' If witnesses of the faith of the Irish are to be, as\r\n    they ought to be, weighed and not counted, the Archbishop of Tuam,\r\n    at least in the capacity of a witness, will easily surpass the\r\n    other Irish bishops, not even excepting his Eminence of Dublin (p.\r\n    218).\r\n\r\nThe above important statement of Archbishop Kenrick shows that the new\r\ndogma, according to which the Bull _Unam Sanctam_ becomes of divine\r\nauthority in doctrine, was not kept out of Maynooth very long after the\r\noaths and denials of preceding years had served their purpose. It was\r\nintroduced as early as 1831.\r\n\r\nThe day following the speech of Cardinal Cullen--for our light on\r\nwhich we are indebted to Kenrick's important contribution--the Primate\r\nof Hungary appeared in the pulpit. His position as a member of the\r\nCommittee on Faith, his doubtful bearing, and, above all, rumours of a\r\nhat, had made an impression that he had gone over to the side of the\r\nInfallibilists. On the contrary, he now spoke with decision and force\r\nagainst them. It was after the courage of the minority had been for a\r\nmoment revived by this speech, that one ascended the desk, who to most\r\npresent was only a feeble old man, but to Irish prelates, and to some\r\nof Irish origin, he represented one who, in the thundering days of\r\nthe Liberator, was spoken of, at every wake and \"patron,\" as a mighty\r\nson of hail and storm. It was he to whom Cullen had appealed, on the\r\nprevious day, as a witness to the ancient faith of the Irish in Papal\r\ninfallibility. But Kenrick has already shown us that John MacHale\r\nstood as a hoary monument of departed principles; and it was when he\r\ncame down that Kenrick cried, \"Thou hast vindicated Ireland.\" Leahy,\r\nArchbishop of Cashel, was the next called up; but after the speech of\r\nMacHale he declined to speak.[411]\r\n\r\nThe archbishops were still on the roll, so the same day the Archbishop\r\nof Paris had his turn. Here again we get an indisputable glimpse into\r\nthe arcana. Like Kenrick's speech, that of Darboy is printed; but\r\nunlike Kenrick's, it was actually delivered.[412] We shall, therefore,\r\ngive the principal portions of it, wishing that we were in a position\r\nto do so with a speech from the other side--\r\n\r\n    Most eminent, most reverend Fathers,--I approach the consideration\r\n    of the First Dogmatic Constitution, _De Ecclesia_, submitted to\r\n    your examination,--a task which would be ungrateful did not love of\r\n    the truth and affection and reverence towards the brethren render\r\n    it easy and not unwelcome. I will treat the proposed Decree with a\r\n    mind, as I trust, free from all party spirit, wishing not to offend\r\n    any one, and fervently hoping that you will ingenuously receive\r\n    what I am about to say, as I shall ingenuously present it.\r\n\r\n    It seems to me that there are three things to be looked at: first,\r\n    the origin of this proposed Decree; secondly, its scope and nature;\r\n    thirdly, its practical consequences.\r\n\r\n    As to the origin of this proposed Decree, and its introduction at\r\n    the present time into the Council, I shall state a few self-evident\r\n    propositions without discussing them, or rather shall recall to\r\n    mind a few facts, from which the reverend Fathers will be able to\r\n    judge whether the whole matter has been conducted according to\r\n    order, and whether the dignity of an assembly so venerable has been\r\n    sufficiently consulted:--\r\n\r\n    1. It is certain that the pivot on which our proposed Decree\r\n    altogether turns is the fourth chapter--that which treats of the\r\n    infallibility of the Pontiff.\r\n\r\n    2. It is certain that this question of infallibility has been the\r\n    principal object of the Vatican Council--so much so indeed that it\r\n    has been indiscreetly said by many that, in a certain sense, it was\r\n    the sole object of it.\r\n\r\n    3. It is certain that this principal question of infallibility was\r\n    not intimated in the Bull of Convocation, nor in the documents\r\n    relating to the convocation of the Council.\r\n\r\n    4. It is certain that this question has been urged forward from\r\n    without, that is, by writers lay and clerical, in a way contrary\r\n    to ecclesiastical and traditional methods, adopted against all\r\n    rules of subordination and decorum; an agitation got up by means\r\n    of demagogues, so to speak, in order that the consciences of the\r\n    bishops sitting here might be placed under pressure, and that they\r\n    might be subjected to fear that, if they resisted they should\r\n    not be able to return to their dioceses and govern them without\r\n    difficulty.\r\n\r\n    5. It is certain that thus the matter has been brought to such\r\n    a pass that the Vatican Fathers, albeit piously and generously\r\n    following their own conscience, have been said, nevertheless, to\r\n    have conceded more than was meet to these violent manifestations,\r\n    and to factitious opinions, when they petitioned for the\r\n    introduction of the question of infallibility; and because of\r\n    this tumult, which has been raised at the doors of the Council\r\n    Hall, the liberty and the dignity of us all have evidently been\r\n    somewhat lowered. This is unbecoming, and opens the way to grave\r\n    inconvenience; indeed, it is not to be tolerated without injury and\r\n    opprobrium to this venerable assembly, which ought to act from its\r\n    own impulse, and ought to be not only free, but manifestly free.\r\n\r\n    6. It is certain that the question, as this day proposed, comes\r\n    on out of the natural and logical order; and thus occasions some\r\n    prejudice which will damage the cause itself.\r\n\r\n    7. It is certain that the premature introduction of the question,\r\n    especially with the present inversion of proper order, is of\r\n    little service to the Holy See--nay, is detrimental to its\r\n    honour; for since, according to the Rules of Procedure, contained\r\n    in _Multiplices Inter_, petitions are remitted to a Special\r\n    Congregation, which reports upon them to the Pontiff, and since\r\n    the Pontiff can freely accept or reject the conclusions of that\r\n    Congregation, it follows that the promoters of the petition for\r\n    introducing the question of infallibility, and for placing it\r\n    first in order, publicly led the Holy Father into the position\r\n    of enacting and deciding in his own case, and for his personal\r\n    privilege; in doing which--certainly without intention on their\r\n    part--they have ill consulted his high dignity, if they may not be\r\n    said to have even detracted from it.\r\n\r\n    If these seven positions be true--and they seem to be most true--we\r\n    cannot approach and determine this question of infallibility,\r\n    raised under such circumstances, and introduced in such a manner,\r\n    without preparing the way for the cavils of the impious, and for\r\n    objections lowering to the moral authority of this Council. This\r\n    is the more to be guarded against, because already writings and\r\n    documents are in circulation which aim at shaking its strength\r\n    and title; so that, far from calming the minds of the people, and\r\n    securing the things which make for peace, it would seem, on the\r\n    contrary, to be sowing the seeds of new disputations and discords\r\n    among Christians.\r\n\r\n    If, therefore, I may give a practical conclusion to this portion of\r\n    my speech, I would say: (1) They did well who held this question to\r\n    be inopportune; (2) They will do well who shall judge it opportune\r\n    to abstain from a definition.\r\n\r\n    Now, as to the second portion of my speech,--the scope and nature\r\n    of this proposed Decree,--I shall indicate a few points, but not\r\n    develop them.\r\n\r\n    1. The object of the proposed Decree is not to frame a doctrine\r\n    on infallibility, for all know and with Catholic faith believe in\r\n    the infallibility of the Church, which has held that tenet for\r\n    nearly twenty centuries. Its object is to define, and to propound\r\n    as an article of faith, that the chief Pontiff is infallible by\r\n    himself alone, and that indeed this privilege of inerrancy extends\r\n    as widely as the infallibility of the Church itself. It is to be\r\n    noted that the proposed Decree does not treat of the former kind of\r\n    infallibility, admitted by all, according to which the invincible\r\n    and irrefragable force of Decrees or dogmatic decisions commanding\r\n    the faith of all the faithful, as of all pastors, lies solely in\r\n    the common consent of the bishops conjoined with the Pontiff. But\r\n    this proposed Decree treats of the separate and absolute personal\r\n    infallibility of the Pontiff, though it is not openly called so.\r\n\r\n    2. The proposed Decree does not treat of personal infallibility\r\n    as a mere opinion, or as recommending a point of doctrine, but as\r\n    declaring a dogma of the faith. Heretofore, indeed, there was some\r\n    discussion as to the opportuneness and expediency of introducing\r\n    this question in the present Council; but that discussion was\r\n    closed from the time that the chief Pontiff decreed that the\r\n    subject could no longer be passed over in silence. But now the\r\n    other part of the question has come to be discussed, namely,\r\n    whether or not the personal infallibility of the Supreme Pontiff\r\n    can opportunely and expediently now be declared an article of the\r\n    faith, and ought to be so declared? This is precisely the matter\r\n    and object of the present discussion.\r\n\r\n    3. Further, in order that the object may be rightly carried\r\n    through, and may have a successful issue, these three things are\r\n    necessary: (1) A formula, or definition of the doctrine; (2) Proofs\r\n    of it, both solid and excluding all doubt; (3) Its acceptance by\r\n    all with moral unanimity.\r\n\r\n    _The first necessity_:--It is necessary to compose a formula or\r\n    definition of the doctrine. That this is most difficult is apparent\r\n    from the case of those who first drafted the proposed Decree, as\r\n    well as of those who revised it. Terms are used which are vague,\r\n    and fitted to give rise to endless discussion. What is meant by\r\n    exercising the office of supreme teacher of all Christians? What\r\n    are the complete external conditions which mark the exercise of\r\n    this office? When will it be known that the Holy Pontiff has spoken\r\n    in such a character? The promoters of the proposed Decree say that\r\n    this will be obvious, as for instance the meaning of the term\r\n    \"oecumenical\" is obvious; but they inflict a wound on themselves.\r\n    For a Council is not held to be oecumenical by the faithful\r\n    dispersed throughout the world, unless it is received as such by\r\n    them perhaps with what amounts to moral unanimity. Hence if the\r\n    nature, character, and force of Decrees emanating from the Pontiff\r\n    are to be declared and known by the same method, the promoters of\r\n    the Decree have accomplished nothing, since the ultimate reason\r\n    for admitting infallibility will be the universal consent of the\r\n    bishops. Do they or do they not regard the consent of the bishops\r\n    as unnecessary in laying down definitions of the faith? If they do\r\n    regard it as unnecessary, they do a thing that is new, unheard of,\r\n    and intolerable. If they do not regard it as unnecessary, they say\r\n    a thing that is old, and received by all, and draw up their battle\r\n    array against a foe that is not in the field. In either case they\r\n    neither can nor ought to be silent as to the necessity or inutility\r\n    of the concurrence of the bishops. Silence on their part in such a\r\n    matter, and in such circumstances, would drive the faithful to new\r\n    doubts, and would prepare the way for new difficulties. They do\r\n    not define the matters to which infallibility extends, otherwise\r\n    than by saying that it extends to those to which the infallibility\r\n    of the Church extends; but such an indication is altogether\r\n    insufficient till the holy Council shall have defined the matters\r\n    to which the infallibility of the Church does extend. Hence, again\r\n    appears the logical vice from which this proposed Decree on the\r\n    primacy suffers through being brought forward before the Decree on\r\n    the Church in general. Moreover, when dealing with the Church, we\r\n    know that her infallibility is always exercised within the limits\r\n    of matters to which it extends, both because we are advised that it\r\n    is so by the common consent of the bishops, and also because the\r\n    Church is holy and cannot sin. But, on the contrary, when dealing\r\n    with the Holy Pontiff, the promoters of the proposed Decree,\r\n    whatever they may say, exclude on the one hand the consent of the\r\n    bishops, and on the other hand they have not yet attempted to prove\r\n    that every Pontiff is holy and impeccable. So far for what relates\r\n    to the discovery of a formula.\r\n\r\n    _The second necessity_:--A formula of definition having been\r\n    found, it is necessary to prove it by solid arguments, excluding\r\n    all doubt. Let it then be proved:--(1) That this doctrine of\r\n    personal infallibility is contained in Holy Scripture interpreted\r\n    always in one sense, as well as in the tradition of all ages;--(2)\r\n    That it has always been received by consent of the Fathers, the\r\n    doctors, the bishops, and theologians; not only by some of them,\r\n    but by so many as amounts to a moral whole;--(3) That it perfectly\r\n    accords with all the Decrees and authoritative acts of OEcumenical\r\n    Councils, or even with the Decrees passed in the fourth and fifth\r\n    sessions of the Council of Constance. Even were the oecumenicity\r\n    of those sessions to be denied--which I do not admit--they still\r\n    show what was the common opinion of theologians and bishops;--(4)\r\n    That this doctrine is not gravely impugned by historical facts,\r\n    and that other acts of the Holy Pontiffs are not in conflict with\r\n    it;--(5) And, finally, that this is one of those truths which\r\n    can be defined by General Councils in union with the Pontiff, as\r\n    being demonstrably one of those which had been received by all,\r\n    everywhere, and always as revealed truth.\r\n\r\n    The proposed Decree does not supply such arguments, and the\r\n    Fathers, as you well know, have not had time to weigh it;\r\n    therefore we ought to refrain from defining it. In a matter of\r\n    this kind, which involves the laying of an irrevocable burden on\r\n    the conscience of the faithful, there is grave peril if you act\r\n    prematurely, without absolute certainty. But there is no risk to be\r\n    run in deciding it to be a matter that requires to be more fully\r\n    discussed, and then afterwards determining it with all safety of\r\n    conscience.\r\n\r\n    _The third necessity_:--It is necessary that this doctrine of\r\n    personal and independent infallibility, clearly stated, as we have\r\n    said, and solidly proved, should be received by the Fathers with\r\n    moral unanimity; else it is to be feared that this declaration\r\n    of doctrine will seem to many to be a pontifical Constitution\r\n    indeed but not a Decree of a Council. To impose a truth upon all\r\n    Christians, to be held as an article of faith, is a duty and a\r\n    right so grave that a bishop must not exercise it without great\r\n    circumspection.\r\n\r\n    Hence, as you well know, the Tridentine Fathers, whatever sophists\r\n    may say to the contrary, did not arrive at their decisions in\r\n    matters of dogma by majority, but with moral unanimity.\r\n\r\n    As to the practical consequences of the proposed Decree, I would\r\n    particularly note two points; for this personal infallibility\r\n    is not required and proposed as a matter of faith, except in\r\n    order that unity in the Church may become closer and that the\r\n    central authority may be stronger, and that thus a remedy may be\r\n    more effectually applied to every evil. As to unity and central\r\n    authority, they ought to exist and to be maintained, not as we may\r\n    fancy them, or as our reason may persuade us, but just as our Lord\r\n    Jesus Christ instituted them, and as our Fathers hitherto have held\r\n    them. For it is not for us to constitute the Church arbitrarily,\r\n    and to change the conditions of a divine work. The necessary unity,\r\n    that namely of faith and communion under the paternal rule of a\r\n    central authority, exists and always has existed among Catholics;\r\n    and that unity of doctrine and communion, and that central\r\n    authority of the Holy Pontiffs, which flourished without a dogmatic\r\n    definition of infallibility, abides unimpaired.\r\n\r\n    Let it not be said that this unity would become stricter after the\r\n    central authority had been rendered stronger, for the consequence\r\n    does not follow. It is not enough to be one, but we must also have\r\n    that kind and that degree of unity which are required by the nature\r\n    and character of the case, and by the law and necessity of life.\r\n    Nay, it may be that a thing shall wretchedly perish, precisely for\r\n    the reason that it has been reduced to an overstrained unity; for\r\n    in that condition its internal forces cannot exercise themselves\r\n    and discharge their vital functions, being broken and crushed by\r\n    the bond of an overstrained and exaggerated unity. So in respect of\r\n    moral force, the unity of men, when acting freely and with vigour\r\n    under law, is looser yet more comely than is the unity of bondsmen\r\n    sluggishly existing under tyranny.\r\n\r\n    Therefore, let us not separate the bishops from the Holy Pontiff,\r\n    nor the Pontiff from the bishops. Let us faithfully hold the\r\n    ancient rule of faith and the things ordained of the Fathers, and\r\n    that all the more because the proposed definition will give rise to\r\n    many and serious inconveniences.\r\n\r\n    It can scarcely be doubted that this remedy will be powerless for\r\n    healing the evils of the day; and indeed it is to be feared that to\r\n    very many it will be injurious. The matter must be looked at not\r\n    merely in a theological point of view, but also in its aspects\r\n    towards civil society; for surely we do not sit here as so many\r\n    head-sacristans, or superiors of little Congregations, but as men\r\n    received into a share of his solicitude by the chief Pontiff, who\r\n    holds the care of the entire Church. Let us, therefore, prudently\r\n    survey the condition of the world.\r\n\r\n    Will personal and independent infallibility raise again from the\r\n    grave the extinct Churches on the African shores? or will it awake\r\n    out of sleep that East which once bloomed with so many talents and\r\n    virtues? Will it be easier for our brethren, the Vicars Apostolic,\r\n    to bring back Pagans, Mohammedans, and Schismatics, to the Catholic\r\n    faith, if they teach them that the Pope is infallible by himself?\r\n    Will the definition encourage and animate Protestants, and other\r\n    heretics, to draw near to the Roman Church, laying aside all their\r\n    prejudices and animosities? So far for distant regions.\r\n\r\n    But what of Europe? I say it with grief--the Church is banished\r\n    from everything. She is banished from those Congresses in which\r\n    peace and war between nations is determined, and in which, in\r\n    former times, the authority of the Holy See prevailed; whereas now\r\n    decisions affecting that See itself are taken, and it may not give\r\n    its opinion. The Church is banished from the legislative bodies in\r\n    several kingdoms of the Church; and if here and there some prelates\r\n    or priests are found in them, it seems a wonder. She is banished\r\n    from the schools where grave errors stalk with impunity; from the\r\n    laws which profess to be secular in their nature, and hence are\r\n    irreligious; from the family where civil marriage taints morals.\r\n    Almost all those who are at the head of human affairs in Europe\r\n    either shun us or keep us at a distance.\r\n\r\n    Again, in these straits of the Church, what remedy is offered to\r\n    the world in travail? The promoters of the proposed Decree wish us\r\n    to lay a new and, therefore, heavy and odious load on those who\r\n    are already shaking from their indocile shoulders burdens imposed\r\n    of old time and rendered venerable by usage of our Fathers. They\r\n    almost crush all who are of weak faith, with a new and inopportune\r\n    dogma, a dogma never heretofore defined, and to some extent damaged\r\n    by wounds received in this discussion, and one to be pronounced\r\n    by a Council, of which many assert and declare that its liberty\r\n    is less evident than it should have been. It is hoped by this\r\n    definition of a personal and separate infallibility to be able\r\n    to heal everything, to strengthen faith in all, and to improve\r\n    morals. But in vain is it hoped. The world is sick or dying, not\r\n    for want of knowing the truth, or the teachers of it, but because\r\n    it shuns the truth and will not submit to it. If, therefore,\r\n    the world rejects the truth, when it is preached by the whole\r\n    body of the Teaching Church--that is, by eight hundred bishops\r\n    scattered all over the world and infallible in connexion with the\r\n    Holy Pontiff--how much more will it reject that truth when it is\r\n    preached by one Infallible Teacher, and that teacher recently\r\n    declared to be such! But again: in order that authority may prevail\r\n    and effectually operate, it is not enough that it be affirmed; it\r\n    must also be accepted. It does not suffice, therefore, to declare\r\n    the Pope infallible, personally and separately from the bishops,\r\n    but he must be received as such by all, if he is not to exercise\r\n    his office in vain. For instance, what avails an anathema when\r\n    the authority of him who excommunicates is disregarded? And, most\r\n    reverend Fathers, pray permit one instance more. The Syllabus went\r\n    all through Europe, and what evil has it healed, even in those\r\n    places where it was received as an infallible oracle? At that time\r\n    two kingdoms remained wherein religion still flourished, ascendant\r\n    not only in fact, but also by law; I mean Austria and Spain. Yet in\r\n    those two kingdoms this Catholic order has fallen to the ground,\r\n    although commended by infallible authority,--ay, perhaps, at least\r\n    in Austria, exactly for the reason that it was commended by it.\r\n\r\n    Let us, therefore, look at matters as they stand. The separate\r\n    and independent infallibility of the most Holy Pontiff, so far\r\n    from removing the objections and prejudices which turn many away\r\n    from the faith, is increasing and aggravating them. Very many\r\n    even of those who are not hostile to the Catholic religion are\r\n    now meditating what they call separation of the Church from civil\r\n    society. Not a few of those who lead public affairs lean in this\r\n    direction, and they will gladly seize the opportunity, given by\r\n    the proposed definition, to carry this separation into effect.\r\n    Besides, what will be done in France will soon be imitated more or\r\n    less throughout Europe, certainly not without serious loss to the\r\n    Church and the clergy. Whether they mean it or not, the promoters\r\n    of the proposed Decree are, by their definition, instituting a new\r\n    order of things full of risks, and that all the more if they do not\r\n    more exactly determine the matters to which personal infallibility\r\n    extends; and [if they do not determine] whether it will be possible\r\n    to assert that the Pope, when defining in matters pertaining to\r\n    morals, does by that act pronounce as to the civil and political\r\n    conduct of kings and nations, and as to the laws and rights which\r\n    are now reputed to belong to the public authority. No one skilled\r\n    in politics can fail to see what seeds of contention our proposed\r\n    Decree contains, and to what perils the temporal power of the\r\n    Holy See itself is exposed. But to enter into this fully would\r\n    be tedious, perhaps indiscreet; for certainly I could not adduce\r\n    here all the arguments which come to my hand, without touching\r\n    upon several things which prudence counsels me to avoid. I have\r\n    relieved my conscience as far as possible. Accept my words for\r\n    the worth which your judgment may award to them. I know, indeed,\r\n    that disadvantages are attached to any course, and that we are\r\n    not always to abstain from acting because disasters may follow;\r\n    but I do not ask the venerable Fathers to fall suddenly into my\r\n    views, but rather ask that they may maturely consider and balance\r\n    the arguments in favour of the one view and the other. I also know\r\n    that we are not to make puerile concessions to public opinion, but\r\n    no more are we pertinaciously to thwart it. It is wiser and more\r\n    adroit to adjust many things with it, and in any case to take it\r\n    into account. And, finally, I know that the Church does not need\r\n    the temporal arm, but neither does she repel the assent and aid\r\n    of civil society; and, as I take it, she did not, in the days of\r\n    Constantine, weakly sigh for a renewal of the days of Nero.\r\n\r\nQuirinus says that a suppressed murmur running through the ranks of the\r\nmajority as Darboy spoke, seemed to herald coming storms (p. 553).\r\n\r\nOn May 23, Ketteler is said to have made a real impression--indeed,\r\nVitelleschi intimates that he made converts (p. 162)--by a strong\r\nrepresentation of the effect of the proposed Decrees on what remained\r\nof episcopal jurisdiction. On the same day Ginoulhiac, who had been\r\nBishop of Grenoble, but had just been made Archbishop of Lyons,\r\ndid what was looked upon as a deed of high courage by opposing the\r\ndefinition.\r\n\r\nAt the same time an incident occurred which caused all Rome to talk of\r\nthe Pope's personal energy in pushing his policy, and to whisper as to\r\nthe mysterious connexion of political movements in different countries\r\nwith the silent will of Rome. Though Portugal no longer occupied, in\r\nthe eye of the world, the place she once held, her importance to the\r\nPapacy was still great. News arrived that the Duke of Saldanha had,\r\nby a military _pronunciamento_, assailed the King in his palace, and\r\ncompelled him to accept a new Ministry, with himself for its head.\r\nHe was of the clerical party, and immediately found a pretext for\r\nquarrelling with the minister representing Italy. The tidings of these\r\nevents no sooner reached Rome than the Pope visited the national church\r\nof the Portuguese in the city. His organ, the _Osservatore Romano_, in\r\nannouncing the fact, said that his Holiness had wished to inspect the\r\nrestoration of the Church made by the Duke of Saldanha when ambassador\r\nin Rome. The impression made was that the Pope wished, before all the\r\nbishops and princes, to give the Duke the only mark of approbation in\r\nhis power. Vitelleschi observes that a _pronunciamento_ is the worst\r\nform of revolution, because it disturbs the highest expression of order\r\nand violates the faith which holds soldiers to their flag (p. 165).\r\nWhat, however, is revolution when directed against the supernatural\r\norder, is restoration and reconstruction when it favours the sacred\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nThe time for the definition was now rather peremptorily fixed by the\r\nauthoritative organs. The day of Mary, the day of Joseph, the Epiphany,\r\nand the Ascension, and other very good days, had all in turn failed;\r\nbut it was to be on St. Peter's Day, and was not that the fittest day\r\nof all?\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Westminster, in the name of the committee, spoke,\r\non May 25, for nearly two hours. Indeed, morning by morning the\r\ncommittee availed itself of the right of reply granted to its members\r\nexclusively, by setting up one of them to refute the objections\r\nadvanced in the previous sitting. Kenrick says that he knew not which\r\nto admire most--Manning's diction, his delivery, his power, of command\r\nand frankness, or his ardour in urging and almost commanding the new\r\ndefinition.[413]\r\n\r\n    \"I thought,\" says Kenrick, \"of what used to be said of Englishmen\r\n    living in Ireland, that they were more Irish than the Irish\r\n    themselves. The Archbishop is certainly more Catholic than all the\r\n    Catholics I have known hitherto. He himself feels no doubt as to\r\n    pontifical infallibility, personal, separate, and absolute; and he\r\n    will not permit others to feel any. He asserts that the doctrine\r\n    is of faith, and as such he hardly asks the Council to define it,\r\n    but rather predicts that it will do so--perhaps after the manner of\r\n    those prophets who strive to bring events to pass by foretelling\r\n    them. So far as concerns myself--as one whom sixty years that have\r\n    passed over me since I began to learn the rudiments of the faith,\r\n    have perhaps left as well instructed on the point in question as\r\n    one who joined the Church about twenty years ago--I dare to assert\r\n    that the opinion, as it is found in the proposed Decree, is not a\r\n    doctrine of faith, and that it cannot become such by any definition\r\n    whatsoever, even that of a Council. We are custodians of the\r\n    deposit of faith, not lords of it. We are teachers indeed of the\r\n    faithful committed to our care, in so far as we are witnesses.\"\r\n\r\nManning resented, _graviter illud tulit_, the attempt which had been\r\nmade to raise a case of conscience in the mind of the bishops by\r\nasserting that any bishop would incur the guilt of a mortal sin who\r\ngave a vote in favour of infallibility without having duly investigated\r\nthe question for himself; because his act would contribute to impose\r\na new yoke on the faithful. This Manning held to be injurious to the\r\ndignity and the honour of the bishops; as if, says Kenrick, he denied\r\nthat bishops could sin, or denied that they would be guilty of mortal\r\nsin if through negligence or idleness they failed rightly to inform\r\ntheir judgments.\r\n\r\nManning contended that infallibility was a supernatural\r\ngrace--_charisma_--and, therefore, that it properly attached to a\r\nperson. He would not hear of conditions being connected with the\r\nexercise of infallibility. He asserted that he who had bestowed this\r\nsupernatural grace would also give the means for its due exercise.[414]\r\nMoreover, he took the ground that the Council had already, in the\r\nconclusion of the Decree which had been passed, committed itself to the\r\ndoctrine of infallibility, and that it could not now recede. Kenrick\r\nreplied that the assertion of Manning was one of several things which\r\nhe had heard with stupefaction. They had been assured, he stated, as\r\nwe have already seen, in the clearest terms by the reporter of the\r\ncommittee, that the clause referred to contained no doctrine, and that\r\nit was only a fitting conclusion to the four chapters of the Decree.\r\nThen follows the statement that the reporter had either himself been\r\ndeceived or had knowingly deceived the minority.\r\n\r\nIn the sitting of May 25, MacEvilly, Bishop of Galway, also referred to\r\nKenrick's argument, drawn from the fact that the Catholics of England\r\nand Ireland had been admitted to equal civil rights on the faith of\r\nrepeated declarations, and even of oaths, to the effect that the\r\ndoctrine of Papal infallibility was not binding on Catholics, and that\r\nconsequently such edicts of Pontiffs as the Bull _Unam Sanctam_ had not\r\ndoctrinal authority. To this MacEvilly replied that the Catholics in\r\nEngland had been admitted to equal civil rights, not because of their\r\ndeclarations, but because the English government feared a civil war.\r\nThe reply of Kenrick to this straightforward utterance is worthy of\r\nbeing given word for word--\r\n\r\n    The doctrine of Papal infallibility was always odious to the\r\n    English government, and had it been really a doctrine of the faith,\r\n    Protestants would have understood Papal doctrine better than\r\n    English and Irish Catholics; for they knew that Roman Pontiffs had\r\n    claimed the highest power in temporal things for themselves, and\r\n    had attempted to drive several English kings from the throne by\r\n    absolving their subjects from the oath of allegiance.\r\n\r\n    Catholics, by public oath repeatedly made, denied that such power\r\n    belonged to the Roman Pontiff in the realm of England, and had\r\n    they not done so, they never would have been or ought to have been\r\n    admitted to equal civil rights.[415] How the faith thus pledged\r\n    to the British government is to be reconciled with the definition\r\n    of Papal infallibility may be looked to by those of the Irish\r\n    prelate who have taken that oath as I myself did I cannot solve the\r\n    difficulty as yet. I am Davus, not Ædipus. Nevertheless those civil\r\n    rights were conceded to Catholics by men who through a long life\r\n    had strongly opposed that course. They did indeed apprehend civil\r\n    war; but they did not dread it in this sense, that a war of that\r\n    kind could not be otherwise hurtful to the power of the government\r\n    than by causing a disturbance of the peace for a certain time.\r\n\r\n    They feared the occurrence of a war, not the result of it, as to\r\n    which no sensible man could have been uncertain. Those great men\r\n    preferred to yield rather than to conquer by the slaughter of a\r\n    brilliant nation, and of a people worthy of a better fate, even in\r\n    what seemed to them its errors. Oh that here the same spirit of\r\n    moderation which they exhibited may be displayed by the majority\r\n    of the bishops who are listening to these words, and that by a\r\n    prevision of the calamities which may arise to us from this hapless\r\n    controversy, they may, in circumstances calling for consummate\r\n    moderation, ward off from us, who are fewer, but who represent a\r\n    greater number of Catholics than those who are opposed to us, evils\r\n    which it is not possible to anticipate without horror, and which it\r\n    would be impossible to repair by a late repentance.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, we cannot but regret that these words, fitly written,\r\nwere not actually spoken in the deaf ears of the resolved majority.\r\nOn the other hand, we remember that had they been spoken, they would\r\nhave sunk into the Vatican archives, and would never have been heard of\r\nmore till those graves give up their dead. They now belong to history,\r\nand furnish a living link in a chain of memorable professions and\r\nperformances. The denationalizing influence of the Papacy had still\r\nleft something of the citizen alive in the soul of Kenrick. During\r\nhis stay in Rome, when witnessing the paltry tyrannies that flounced\r\nabout under the dependent banner of the Pope, all of the citizen that\r\nwas left in him must have turned with fresh respect to the two flags\r\nof the free under which he had spent his days--the flags of England\r\nand America. And yet there were those sitting there, each with all the\r\nrights of a free man in his hands, planning to reconstruct the society\r\nof England and America on the degraded and fettered model of the States\r\nof the Roman Bishop. There is a crime which no code has defined--the\r\ncrime, not of breaking one specific law of one's country, but of\r\ncontriving, with a foreign pretender, how to overturn everything vital\r\nin a venerable and generous legislation.\r\n\r\nIt was not merely by a pupil of Maynooth that the eager ex-Anglican was\r\nconsidered extreme in his views. Clifford, Bishop of Clifton, spoke\r\non the same day, refuting the notions of Manning about the favourable\r\neffects to be produced by his beloved dogma in England, and appealing\r\nto him as a witness that an eminent statesman had represented the\r\ninfluence of the recent course of the Curia upon public opinion in\r\nEngland as being much to the disadvantage of their own cause, and\r\ngreatly to the encouragement of extreme Protestants.[416]\r\n\r\nIn the next Congregation, on the 28th, it was Senestrey who took\r\nthe post occupied on the last morning by Manning, that of official\r\nrespondent against attacks. On that day, a scene was raised by Verot,\r\nof Florida. He declared that they were making innovations in the\r\nChurch, and that such an innovation as the personal infallibility of\r\nthe Pope was sacrilege. That horrid word applied in the sacred place\r\nto an object so dear to the Pope, touched indeed the apple of the eye.\r\nSacrilege! The Cardinals de Angelis and Capalti, says Vitelleschi,\r\nquite lost their temper; and a scene ensued which for anger and\r\nexcitement is said to have fallen but little short of Strossmayer's\r\nscene in March.[417] The odious, and to well-tuned Curialistic ears\r\nthe inconceivable, task of hearing the infallibility of the Pope\r\ndenied, and of seeing his pleasure daily thwarted under the roof of St.\r\nPeter's, was not to be endured any longer. The word passed that the\r\npower given by the new Rules to close the debate must be called into\r\nrequisition.\r\n\r\nA trusty American was set up in the next meeting, by the committee, to\r\nrepair the mischief done by Verot--Spalding, of Baltimore. Here, again,\r\nwe are indebted for light to Kenrick's unspoken speech. Referring\r\nto the moral question which had been raised by Kenrick, to which we\r\nhave already seen allusions, Spalding said that it called for as\r\nmuch investigation to justify one in giving a negative as in giving\r\nan affirmative vote on the question of Papal infallibility, and that\r\nin withholding an affirmative vote one would confirm the celebrated\r\nGallican articles.\r\n\r\nOn May 31, Valerga, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, made a vigorous attack\r\non the minority, speaking cleverly, and hitting hard. Spirited,\r\n_piquant_, and insolent, is the description of Quirinus. Soon\r\nafterwards, another American was in the desk, Purcell, of Cincinnati.\r\nQuirinus says that he affirmed that the Americans abhorred every\r\ndoctrine opposed to civil and spiritual freedom; and that the American\r\nsons of the Church loved her, because she was the freest society in\r\nthe world. He also took the position that, as kings existed for the\r\ngood of the people, so the Pope existed for the good of the Church. On\r\nthe same day spoke Conolly, Archbishop of Halifax. He seems to be the\r\nonly one in the Council who really related a theological experience,\r\ndeclaring that he had formerly believed in the personal infallibility\r\nof the Pope, and had come to Rome believing that the _Augsburg Gazette_\r\nhad circulated a calumny in representing the dogmatizing of this\r\nopinion as the real object of the Council. He went on to say that, on\r\nfinding what was expected of him, he determined to sift the arguments\r\nof the Roman theologians and the proofs by which they supported them.\r\nHe now bore witness to the result upon his own views. All antiquity,\r\nhe declared, explained the passages harped upon by those theologians,\r\nin a sense different from theirs. All antiquity bore witness against\r\nthe notion that the Pope alone, and separate from the bishops, was\r\ninfallible. He further took the ground that to found a dogma on the\r\nrejection of the traditional interpretation of Scripture was pure\r\nProtestantism. I will have nothing, he said, turned into dogma but the\r\nindubitable Word of God. Ten thousand theologians do not suffice for\r\nme, and on the present subject no theologian should be quoted who lived\r\nsubsequent to the Isidorean forgeries. To define the dogma would be to\r\nbring the Vatican Council into contradiction with the three General\r\nCouncils which had condemned Pope Honorius as a heretic, to narrow the\r\ngates of heaven, to repel the East, and to proclaim, not peace, but\r\nwar. In reply to Manning, he protested that no one was justified in\r\ncalling an opinion proximate heresy when it had not been condemned as\r\nsuch by the Church.[418]\r\n\r\nOn June 3, Gilooly, Bishop of Elphin, replying to some observation of\r\nPurcell as to the oaths and declarations, said[419] that Catholics had\r\nnot denied that they held the infallibility of the Pope as a doctrine\r\nof the faith, but as a dogma of the faith; that is as a dogma defined\r\nby a General Council. To this, Kenrick's unspoken speech replies,\r\n\"If that is what was meant, which I do not believe, we might be\r\nreproached, and that rightfully and deservedly, with not shrinking, in\r\na very grave matter, from the concealment of our meaning by scholastic\r\ndistinctions.\"[420] According to Quirinus (p. 661), Cardinal Bonnechose\r\nprevailed upon Cardinal de Angelis to ask the Pope, directly, if he\r\nwould not consent to a prorogation of the Council on account of the\r\nheat, now intolerable to all but Romans, or men from the southward of\r\nRome. The reply was stern and, according to many, savage. Whatever were\r\nthe terms of it, the substance was indubitable--no adjournment was to\r\nbe allowed till the Decree of Infallibility was passed. It is said that\r\nwhen Bishop Domenec, of Pittsburg, in America, began his discourse, he\r\nwas greeted with laughter by the majority, and when he made the very\r\nplain and simple statement--one which he might have picked up from any\r\nintelligent or travelled Italian any day in the year--that American\r\nCatholics were not merely nominal ones, as the Italians were, Cardinal\r\nCapalti imperiously commanded silence.[421] Strossmayer had spoken at\r\nlength on June 2, and with such moderation as to escape even a call to\r\norder, yet, it is said, with very great force. On the 3rd, Moriarty,\r\nof Kerry, took the side of Purcell, Kenrick, and MacHale, but we have\r\nno particulars of his speech.[422] That day Maret was in the desk\r\nspeaking in the loud and labouring tone of a deaf man, arguing, not\r\nonly against the convictions and feelings of the majority, but against\r\ntheir personal detestation of himself. He made a point that either\r\nthe Council was to give infallibility to the Pontiff, in which case\r\nthe Council must be a higher authority than he, or else the Pontiff\r\nwas to give to himself an infallibility which he had not previously\r\npossessed, in which case he would change the constitution of the Church\r\nby his own power alone. Then Cardinal Bilio interrupted, and cried,\r\n\"The Council does not give anything, nor can it give anything. It gives\r\nits suffrage, and the Holy Father decides what he pleases.\"[423] The\r\nrepresentative of all that was left of the once courageous Gallican\r\nliberties asked if he might be allowed to proceed, and did so. The\r\nminority had a long list of speakers still inscribed. Kenrick was\r\nwaiting for his turn, and so were Haynald, Dupanloup, and many others;\r\nbut a fresh surprise was at this point sprung upon them. The Presidents\r\nproduced a requisition for the close of the general debate, signed by\r\nabove one hundred and fifty bishops.[424] De Angelis at once called\r\non those who were for the closing of the debate to stand up. He then\r\ndeclared, \"A large majority have stood up, and by the power conferred\r\nupon us by Our Most Holy Lord (the capitals are official), we close\r\nthe debate on the general question.\" The _Acta Sanctæ Sedis_ say that\r\nabout fifty remained sitting. No wonder that, after hearing sixty-five\r\nspeakers, the Fathers were weary. Yet, no wonder, on the other hand,\r\nthat the minority should allege that, while it was perfectly reasonable\r\nto close a debate in this manner when the object was that of making\r\ntemporal laws liable to be unmade, or re-made, a year later, it was\r\nneither reasonable nor fair, and above all, it was not agreeable to any\r\nprecedent, to past professions, or to any ecclesiastical principle, to\r\nclose a debate upon a dogma while yet there were prelates wanting to\r\nbear witness to the tradition of their respective Churches. According\r\nto all their theologians, dogma was not to be made by mere opinion, but\r\nby evidence of the fact that the opinion in question had been believed\r\nfrom the beginning. Protestants would naturally say that it was time to\r\nbury this pretence under any heap; but men whose life had been spent\r\nunder the illusion of the pretence naturally felt otherwise. They\r\nhad not seen that when the Church adopted the principle of tradition\r\ninstead of that of Scripture, the Spouse, while professing only to\r\nsupplement the word of her Lord, really entered on a course which\r\nmust lead to setting it aside in favour of her own word, and that\r\nwhen she had adopted the principle of general consent, instead of\r\nthat of clear apostolical tradition, she had set aside the principle\r\nof antiquity for that of a majority amounting to a moral whole, and\r\nthat now she was only proceeding a step further in substituting the\r\nprinciple of a numerical majority for that of moral unanimity. But one\r\nstep more remained, and that was not far off. The Spouse who had put\r\naside the authority of her Lord to exalt her own, was to find, not\r\nonly her authority, but even her consent, formally repudiated before\r\nall men by the master whom she had, in the house of her Lord, set up\r\nin His place. In that house the talk was evermore of her authority,\r\nher wisdom, her infallibility, her glory, her stores of merit and her\r\nstreams of blessing, and but rarely was her Lord heard of, except as\r\nhaving conferred the regency on her. Now drew nigh the day when the\r\nself-asserting Spouse was, before all men whom her loud vauntings had\r\naroused, to receive on her brow such a stigma from her self-chosen\r\nMaster as has seldom in set terms been affixed to a society by its\r\nhead. Meantime the blow which had just been dealt seemed fatal to all\r\nthe hopes of the minority. So once more they dragged their robes down\r\nthe marble way of St. Peter's with defeat behind them, but this time\r\nwith annihilation close before, though not till after further strange\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 402: _Vitelleschi_, p. 158.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 403: _Quirinus_, p. 532.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 404: _Quirinus_, p. 533.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 405: _Frond_, vol. ii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 406: _Documenta ad Illustrandum_, ii. 209.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 407: \"_Meum honorem graviter læserunt._\"--_Documenta ad\r\nIllustrandum_, i. 189.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 408: _Documenta ad Illustrandum_, pp. 187-224.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 409: _Aliquid humani passum esse._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 410: He showed that Tischendorf read προβἁτια\r\nin both cases, and that other editors had read πρὁβατα in\r\nboth.

So it proved. The very day of the forcible conclusion of the\r\ngeneral debate, the French bishops met, and were favourable to some\r\ndetermined action.[425] But the next day, eighty congregated in the\r\nrooms of Cardinal Rauscher. The Hungarians, French, and Americans,\r\nwith Strossmayer, Clifford, and Conolly, are named by Quirinus as\r\nrecommending that the Fathers of the Opposition should cease to take\r\nany part in the Council, reserving themselves for the final vote, and\r\nshould then give their _Non placet_. The Germans, however, always\r\nmarplots, urged that the better course would be to adopt a protest,\r\nand continue to take part in the proceedings. This counsel prevailed.\r\nRauscher drew up a form of protest, which was signed by some eighty\r\nprelates, and many of the bishops took a trip to Naples or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAmong the things represented by Quirinus as having been said on this\r\noccasion, one was to the effect that in a Parliament speeches were\r\nof some use, for if they did not influence votes, they did enlighten\r\npublic opinion; but in this Council, most of the hearers were, from\r\ntheir degree of culture, quite incapable of apprehending theological\r\narguments, not to add that, in a moral point of view, many of them\r\nstood so low that even if convinced they would not act on their\r\nconvictions. The ground taken in the protest is clear, namely, that\r\nthe right of supporting their votes by a statement of reasons, is one\r\nwhich, by the very nature of a Council, belongs not only to some of its\r\nmembers, but to them all, and that such a right could not be taken away\r\nby any vote of a majority.[426]\r\n\r\nThe Hungarians now declared that they would take no further part in the\r\ndebates. On the other hand, the _Unitá Cattolica_ foretold how those\r\nwho had written or spoken as Gallicans would be converted by a miracle\r\nof the Holy Ghost, even in the Council Hall; and as the Galileans had\r\nbeen constrained to speak in other tongues, so would the Gallicans be\r\nconstrained to proclaim in that Hall before the astonished multitudes\r\nthe doctrine they had gainsaid.\r\n\r\nThe absorbing care of the Curia and its instruments was now directed\r\nto the one end of constraining all to vote _placet_. The victory was\r\nno longer doubtful, but to procure unanimity was of great practical\r\nmoment. The Pope himself was indefatigable. His admirers resented such\r\nepithets as \"unscrupulous\" when applied to his conduct. But they took\r\ngood care not to grapple with the details of alleged facts which, if\r\nthey could be credibly told about the conduct of one of our sovereigns\r\nin respect to his nobles or to Parliament, would be described in much\r\nstronger epithets than unscrupulous. His tongue was evermore scattering\r\nrebukes or blandishments, and enlivening the city with crackling sparks\r\nof gossip. There were but few bishops of note among the minority whose\r\nportraits, etched by the infallible acid, were not handed round the\r\n_salons_, lay and clerical. His letters were bitter and undignified.\r\nQuirinus quotes the words of a French bishop (p. 627): \"There is no\r\nlonger any scruple as to what is done to gain votes. It is a horror.\r\nThere has never been anything like it in the Church.\" These words\r\nrecall to us a scene in Rome. A remarkable head--one of those heads\r\nwhich bear on the brow a diploma of gifts and letters--was stooping in\r\nthe light of a lamp by which pages had been penned that had been heard\r\nof beyond Italy. The stoop was pensive, and the thinker said, \"I saw so\r\nmuch of what was done during that Council, that it has destroyed all my\r\nfaith in anything that ever was done in the Church before.\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem as if, at the last, argument and appeal had begun to tell\r\non some of those who were of a milder mood among the Curialists. It is\r\nsaid that even of the chosen three champions, Manning, Deschamps, and\r\nPie, the last wished to find some formula less offensive than the one\r\nprojected. Martin of Paderborn even proposed a note which contained\r\na recognition of the teaching authority of bishops, though in an\r\nindirect way. On the other hand, the members of the Opposition tried to\r\ndiscover some turn of expression which would save the Church from the\r\nshame of being publicly disavowed by her wilful lord. Conolly spoke of\r\nproposing, as a formula which would still give her a recognised voice,\r\nwords declaring the Pope infallible when he spoke, \"as head of the\r\nChurch teaching with him.\" Others again wished to reinstate the formula\r\nof St. Antoninus, of Florence, declaring the Pope infallible when he\r\nacts with the counsel of the universal Church.[427]\r\n\r\nMen now began to realize the full effect of the proposed dogma, both\r\nin its executive and in its retrospective aspects. Many must have\r\nremembered how happy they had been in argument, or in diplomacy, when\r\nthe ambiguous state of the case, as it had hitherto existed, enabled\r\nthem to evade the charge that such and such were the principles of the\r\nChurch. It was so convenient to be able to say No, they have never been\r\nsanctioned by a Council; they are only the words of a Papal Decree.\r\nNow, however, all these words were to have fresh life breathed into\r\nthem, and whatever they contained affecting a general principle of\r\nbelief, or practice, was to be taken for divine,--was, in fact, to rank\r\nas the word of God.\r\n\r\nDelay now became the forlorn hope of the minority, and expedition\r\nthe watchword of the majority. The minority were sure that the Pope\r\nwould not be so cruel as to force them to continue in Rome during the\r\nsummer heats. Hence, they thought that by delay they were certain of\r\na prorogation before the fatal deed was done. They forgot the history\r\nof the Pope's prisons and executions. Perhaps they had never read it,\r\nor had used their fatal facility of calling an unpleasant statement a\r\nlie. Antonelli had generally carried away the chief part of the blame\r\nfor the blood of the political victims. However, he seems completely\r\nto have escaped reproach for the broiling of the bishops. Whether\r\nthe fierce language ascribed to the Pope was correct or not, nobody\r\ndoubted its aptness.[428] When even the faithful M. Veuillot said,\r\nSince they have put the Council upon the gridiron, they shall broil\r\n(ii. p. 352), everyone treated him as only echoing the language of his\r\nidol. When once the heats had begun to tell, the feelings of majority\r\nand minority, as Vitelleschi points out, changed. Men from the north,\r\naccustomed to the bracing air and pure streams of Germany, could ill\r\nbear up against the miasma from the Roman marshes and the torrid heats\r\nthat were withering the city and making even natives look pale. They\r\ntherefore began to long for an escape, and not a few of them took\r\ntheir way homewards. They received not only ready but glad permission.\r\nThus every day was diminishing the strength of the Opposition. The\r\nmajority, on the other hand, consisting of Italians, South Americans,\r\nand Spaniards, were inured to the heats, if not to the malaria, and\r\nfelt that the sun and the marshes were conspiring with them. Apollo\r\nhad come to camp shooting over the heads of the natives, but laying low\r\nthe men from beyond the sea.\r\n\r\nThere was now only one consideration that would make the Pope anxious\r\nfor despatch, and that was the daily pressure upon his finances caused\r\nby supporting his three hundred boarders. This certainly had proved a\r\nuseful ground of appeal for funds. The sums collected everywhere had\r\nbeen great. The _Civiltá_ reproaches the Liberal Catholics with not\r\nsending money any more than they had sent men to fight for the Holy\r\nFather, and sets in contrast with their stinginess and want of military\r\nspirit the fact that the _Univers_ alone had sent in more than nine\r\nthousand pounds (234,410 francs).[429] The Holy Father said, \"They fear\r\nmaking the Pope infallible, but they do not fear making him fail.\"[430]\r\nBut M. Veuillot, on the contrary, did not fear making him infallible,\r\nand did everything possible to prevent him from failing. Hence it was\r\nno wonder that he should have briefs to publish which would perform\r\na service for the exchequer of the _Univers_ similar to what the\r\n_Univers_ performed for the exchequer of the author of the briefs.\r\nThe words of the Pope spoken to the deputation of scientific men were\r\nrepresentative words, \"Here I am to receive your offerings.\"\r\n\r\nTheiner, the celebrated Prefect of the Vatican archives, now fell\r\npublicly under displeasure. He had allowed Hefele and Strossmayer, and\r\nperhaps others, to see the order of procedure of the Council of Trent,\r\nand probably had in other ways shown leanings not acceptable to the\r\nJesuits. He was ordered to give up his keys to Cardoni, who had been\r\nthe first chosen secretly to prepare Drafts of Decrees on Infallibility\r\nbefore intentions were disclosed, and had kept his counsel well. The\r\narchives were actually closed against Theiner. It is said that the\r\npassage into them from his own rooms was walled up. The disgrace of\r\nTheiner, and the honour of Cardoni, sharply symbolized the favourite\r\nsaying that the dogma must conquer history. Here again Antonelli\r\nescaped all reproach of a share in the blundering injustice. Cardoni\r\nwas one singled out by name in a celebrated letter of Döllinger as\r\nhaving largely employed falsified authorities. But that charge, to us\r\nso revolting, is a familiar sound wherever the shadow of the Curia\r\nextends.[431] We ourselves once heard a member of the Congregation of\r\nthe Index claim, unmindful of the presence of a Protestant, \"You must\r\nnever trust any edition of any work whatever that has passed through\r\nthe hands of the Jesuits.\"\r\n\r\nThe exciting matters now remaining to be treated in the Council were\r\nthe all-important particulars of those Drafts which had already been\r\nunder a general review. The two chapters teaching the institution\r\nof the primacy in the person of Peter, and the transmission of that\r\nprimacy through the Roman Pontiffs as his successors, were speedily\r\ndisposed of. Had all the fathers attempted to answer the arguments of\r\nDesanctis on these points, arguments familiar to many Italians, they\r\nwould not have found it light work. But the third chapter was one\r\nof immense importance. It defined the scope and nature of primacy,\r\ndistending that term till it was made to cover absolute, immediate,\r\nand ordinary control in the whole domain of the Church--control over\r\nbishops and people, control over not only all matters ordinarily\r\nincluded under the expression \"faith and morals,\" but over all things\r\nheld to be necessary for the government or discipline of the Church.\r\nThis last expression, as any one acquainted with the views of those in\r\nauthority, even so far as they are recorded in our preceding pages,\r\nmust know, covers almost every possible question that can arise. The\r\nwords of Vitelleschi (p. 174) are well considered. He speaks of the\r\n\"supreme jurisdiction, ordinary and universal, of the Pope over all\r\nChurches, singly and collectively, over pastors as well as flocks; from\r\nwhich doctrine it follows that bishops in exercising any jurisdiction\r\nor authority, only do so as official delegates of the Pope.\" Dr. Langen\r\nputs it thus: \"Seeing that there can be only one bishop in a diocese,\r\nas soon as the Pope is declared to have ordinary jurisdiction in\r\nthat diocese, he becomes its Ordinary, and the other person called a\r\nbishop is nothing more than his delegate and representative.\"[432] Men\r\nwho cover a dominion of this sort under the pretext of primacy, and\r\nwho advance a claim of primacy in order to deduce from it an absolute\r\ndictatorship, never do anything more sensible than when they decry\r\nreason and relegate Scripture to the tradition-heap; when they call\r\nfor pictures instead of books, and processions and fireworks instead\r\nof a free press and free discussion. There was political philosophy in\r\nM. Veuillot's exclamation on witnessing the Easter rejoicings in Rome,\r\nespecially the fireworks representing \"the heavenly Jerusalem,\" that\r\nit was impossible not to respect a people for whom such entertainments\r\nwere provided.\r\n\r\nThe first assertion in the Decree of ordinary and immediate\r\njurisdiction over all Churches, oddly does not describe that\r\njurisdiction as belonging to the Pope, but as belonging to the Roman\r\nChurch (par. 2). No sooner, however, has principality been ascribed\r\nto the Roman Church than it is instantly transferred to the Pontiff,\r\nand is again instantly affirmed to be a truly episcopal power. This\r\nconfusion, in such a document, would be amusing if the matter were not\r\nso serious. That a Church should be a bishop is certainly new; and\r\nthat a truly episcopal power should reside in a Church which is not a\r\nbishop, is one of the many mysteries created by the Vatican Council.\r\nBut that the source of the Pontiff's authority should in this very\r\nDecree be sought in the Church, is a proof how hard a task is theirs\r\nwho determine to make dogma conquer history. In the very language of\r\nthe Decree, history conquers the dogma.\r\n\r\nIf the document contains this one taint of dualism as between Church\r\nand Pope, it is clear of all reproach of dualism as between the Pope\r\nand Princes. The latter are legislated out of all rights that could\r\npossibly conflict with those of their Lord Paramount. Notwithstanding\r\nthe slight dualism as between Pope and Church, the latter is also\r\nlegislated out of all her ancient claims; but incidentally she appears\r\nin clauses which, if she was only infallible without the consent of\r\nthe Pope, as he is infallible without her consent, might in time prove\r\nvery awkward. He has only as much infallibility as she has: that is\r\na clumsy admission just before the assertion that he is infallible\r\nwithout her consent. However, wherever the power resides, or springs\r\nfrom, it is a power over all pastors and all believers, and extends,\r\nas we have said, not only to faith and morals, but to all things\r\nwhich affect the government of the Church. Thus it includes every\r\nmixed question whatsoever, and all things of any kind which in the\r\nestimation of the Pope of Rome may relate to the interests of that\r\nkingdom of which he is the king. This power, moreover, is immediate,\r\nand as such can act without being legally restricted to any processes,\r\nany agencies, or any forms. Being ordinary, it can never be obliged to\r\nwait until the ordinary jurisdiction has been tried and failed. Being\r\nimmediate, it can never be told that it must take this, that, or the\r\nother line of procedure. This language for ever settles the point which\r\nhad been contested in the famous passage of letters with Darboy.\r\n\r\nHow it could be necessary to add another word after these affirmations\r\nwe can hardly see. Even Councils, or the pastors collectively, had\r\nbut one office assigned to them--the office of obeying. After this\r\nthe abstract proclamation of Infallibility, or Irreformability, or\r\nInerrancy, could add nothing to a power that was universal, ordinary,\r\nand immediate, and towards which the people or bishops, singly or\r\ncollectively, stood in one relation only--that of subjects in presence\r\nof an authority which they were bound absolutely to obey. It naturally\r\nfollows that it is in this obedience that Rome finds unity. That is,\r\nin fact, her ideal of unity. Christians are Churchmen, not by being\r\nChristians, but by obeying the Roman Pontiff. Under the Papacy a\r\nChristian is outside the family of God if he does not obey the Cæsar of\r\nthe Church.\r\n\r\nAbsolute authority over bishops and people having been asserted, next\r\ncomes the assertion of authority over princes. This is done in a\r\nparagraph in which only students would see anything of the kind. The\r\nfourth paragraph of the third chapter begins by speaking of the Pope's\r\nright to free communication with the pastors and flocks of the whole\r\nChurch. What could appear more natural, or less dangerous? Had we not\r\nseen how much the communications of the Pope amount to, we should have\r\ntaken that as a meek and harmless claim. But the close of the paragraph\r\nshows that what the Pope means is the right of giving to his own\r\nedicts the binding force of a higher law in every country, whether the\r\ngovernment consents or does not consent. As primacy means dictatorship,\r\nso communication means promulging laws in regard to which no human\r\nbeing has the right of reply, inquiry, complaint, or appeal; has, we\r\nrepeat, no office whatever except that of obedience. We have seen that\r\n\"teach\" in our Lord's commission to the apostles means so to give law\r\nto the _nations_ that they can never be justified in resisting. No\r\nprince can have any title to exercise an _exequatur_, _placet_, or any\r\nother form of check upon an edict of the Pope. Every man who denies the\r\nvalidity of a Papal law, because it is prohibited by the government of\r\nthe country, is solemnly condemned; he interrupts the communication\r\nbetween the authority of the Pontiff and the conscience of his\r\nsubjects. Indeed, the condemnation extends to all who even say that his\r\ndecrees may be lawfully impeded in their execution. The reason of this\r\nappears in the next paragraph. The Pope is there formally declared the\r\nSupreme Judge of the faithful. Therefore all may justly resort to his\r\njudgment in all matters subject to ecclesiastical inquiry, and none may\r\nappeal from his judgment, for there is no authority greater than his.\r\nMatters subject to ecclesiastical inquiry must always include all those\r\nwherein the interests of the Papacy are in anywise involved. Next, even\r\nthe old appeal to a General Council is formally condemned. Yet even\r\nthat condemnation is bungled. None may appeal from the judgment of\r\nthe Pope to a General Council \"as an authority superior to the Roman\r\nPontiff.\" Then, will lawyers say, we can only appeal to a General\r\nCouncil as an authority equal to the Roman Pontiff.\r\n\r\nIf these fourth and fifth paragraphs of the third chapter of the\r\nDecree on Primacy were read by a dozen educated Englishmen unused\r\nto Roman Catholic interpretations of Papal laws, nearly all of them\r\nwould put aside clause after clause as not being of importance. They\r\nwould take the _damnamus_ and _reprobamus_ as so much sulphur, and\r\nlet it pass. Far otherwise Vitelleschi. \"From a practical point of\r\nview,\" he says, \"the declarations of infallibility could add nothing\r\nto the weight of this paragraph\" (p. 177). Vitelleschi looks upon the\r\nexpress declaration of infallibility, in the next chapter, as no more\r\nthan \"indulgence in the luxury of self-assertion, to which absolute\r\nprinciples are prone.\" Yet when Mr. Gladstone pointed out the true\r\nrange of the authority here set up, many of our politicians treated him\r\nas a statesman who had strayed out of his domain into theology. Since\r\nthen, specimens of minimizing interpretation have been put into our own\r\ntongue, as curious as any furnished by the history of _finesse_. If\r\nthere be one Canon expressing a rule absolute that needs no exception\r\nto prove it, we have it in the words, Rome never minimises. She always\r\ninterprets her own documents as a legatee interprets a will, that is,\r\nin her own favour.\r\n\r\nOn June 15 the Council disposed of all the matters that stood in the\r\nway of the great question. Seventy-five speakers had entered their\r\nnames. Two speeches were actually made on that day by Cardinals\r\nMathieu and Rauscher.[433] The latter said that he could never assent\r\nto the doctrine of the Draft without mortal sin. \"We knew all that\r\nfrom your pamphlet,\" cried Deschamps, interrupting. \"But you have\r\nnever refuted it,\" replied the Austrian.[434] The following day was\r\nthe grand procession of the Corpus Christi. If the \"good press\" was\r\nparsimonious in information regarding debates and decrees, it was\r\nprofuse in description of the spectacles. On the 17th, Pius IX entered\r\non the twenty-fifth year of his pontificate. This year, according to\r\nRoman tradition, is fatal to the Pontiffs, it being held that Peter\r\nreigned twenty-five years, and that none of his successors was to reign\r\nlonger. Vitelleschi declares that the twenty-fifth year proved fatal\r\nto Pius IX, as well as to the rest, because in the course of it he\r\nceased to be a mere mortal. This phrase from a Liberal Catholic will\r\nseem natural when set beside one of M. Veuillot, on the day on which\r\nPius IX completed the twenty-fifth year of his pontificate: \"We are\r\nreminded of the radiance of Jordan and of Tabor, of the thunders of\r\nthe Temple, 'This is my beloved Son, hear ye him'\" (vol. ii. p. 468).\r\nOn the next page he says, \"God has left us His priest, His angel, the\r\nsacred interpreter of His law, the anointed intercessor between Him\r\nand the world ... a second Peter, a second Moses on the threshold of\r\na new world.\" It remains to be seen whether the twenty-fifth year of\r\nPius IX was or was not that of the final fall of the temporal power. If\r\nthe speeches on the doctrine and polity of the Church were concealed,\r\nthe Pope's speech this day, in reply to the Sacred College, was blazed\r\nabroad. He divided the bishops into three classes--the ignorant, the\r\ntime-serving, and the good. So flowed abroad fresh streams from that\r\nfountain which, all the time, was sending forth both sweet waters and\r\nbitter.\r\n\r\nOn June 18, the debate on the fourth chapter, that is, on\r\ninfallibility, really began. It was a day of Cardinals. Pitra, Guidi,\r\nBonnechose, and Cullen were the sole orators. Hitherto, what with the\r\nheat and what with the feeling that all was over, no interest had\r\nattached to the renewed debates after the violent close of the general\r\ndiscussion. But the torpor was suddenly shaken. A speech by a Roman, a\r\nDominican and a Cardinal (Guidi), came upon the city, says Vitelleschi,\r\nlike a sudden thunderclap in a cloudless sky. The Cardinal, like nearly\r\nall the members of the Sacred College, was a \"creature\" of Pius IX.\r\nAccording to Vitelleschi, he began his speech as a Cardinal should,\r\nbut, according to Quirinus, he offended at the very first. Unhappily,\r\nin a matter of difference of this kind, the writers who enjoyed \"the\r\nradiance of infallibility\" give us no light. So we are left at the\r\nmercy of those whose assertions were all lies in general, but somehow,\r\nwhen attacked in detail, generally proved to be truths in particular.\r\nIn the present case, we do not remember that even M. Veuillot attempts\r\nto impugn any of the facts stated. However Guidi may have begun, he\r\naffirmed that the doctrine of Papal infallibility, as contained in\r\nthe proposed Decree, was unknown to the Church up to the close of\r\nthe fourteenth century. Proofs of this doctrine were to be sought in\r\nvain in either Scripture or tradition. As a practical question, when\r\nhad the Pope ever defined one dogma alone, and without the Church? An\r\nact, he continued, might be infallible, but a person never. Hitherto\r\ninfallible acts had proceeded from the Church, either by counsel of\r\nthe Church dispersed, or by a Council. Inquiry was indispensable to\r\nascertain \"what was believed everywhere, and whether all Churches were\r\nin agreement with the Roman Church.\" After such inquiry, the Pope\r\nsanctioned \"finally,\" as St. Thomas says; and thus only could it be\r\nsaid that \"all taught through the Pope.\" Quoting Bellarmine, and even\r\nthe modern Jesuit Perrone, he showed that \"the Popes had never acted\r\nby themselves alone in defining doctrine, or by themselves alone in\r\ncondemning heresies.\" At these words, _Spaccapietra_, an Italian, but\r\nBishop of Smyrna, led in a disturbance. One bishop cried \"Scoundrel!\"\r\nanother cried \"Brigand!\" Vitelleschi even speaks of violent gestures\r\n(p. 189). Guidi said he had the right to be heard, and that no one\r\nhad given the right of the Presidents to the bishops; but he added,\r\n\"You will have the opportunity of saying _Placet_ or _Non placet_.\"\r\nHereupon, from all ranks of the Opposition burst out a cry of \"_Optime!\r\noptime!_\"--excellent! excellent! \"Do you agree with us?\" asked a bishop\r\nof Manning. \"The Cardinal's head is bewildered,\" was the reply. On\r\nthis, says Quirinus, a bishop could not refrain from saying to the\r\npowerful Archbishop of Westminster, \"It is your own head, Monsignor,\r\nthat is bewildered, and more than half Protestant.\" If this language\r\nwas really used, we must doubt whether it was infallible.\r\n\r\nGuidi went on to advocate a change in the wording of the Decree, to\r\nthe effect that the Pope acted with the concurrence of the bishops,\r\nand that after having, at their request, occasioned by prevalent\r\nerrors, made inquiry in other Churches, he acted with the consent of\r\nhis brethren, or with that of a collective Council. He contended that\r\nthis was the doctrine of St. Thomas; that the word \"final\" implied\r\nsomething to precede, and that \"supreme teacher and judge\" presupposed\r\n\"other teachers and tribunals.\" He concluded by proposing two Canons,\r\nthe first of which declared Papal Decrees or Constitutions to be\r\nentitled to cordial faith and reverence, and not to be reformable; but\r\nthe second said, If any one shall say that, in issuing such Decrees,\r\nthe Pope can act arbitrarily without the counsel of the bishops as\r\ntestifying to the tradition of the Church, let him be anathema.[435]\r\nOn finishing his discourse, he at once handed his manuscript to the\r\nsecretaries.\r\n\r\nQuirinus relates that Valerga audibly said, in reply to some question,\r\n\"Guidi is misguided.\" But his neighbour replied that Guidi's speech\r\ncontained nothing but the truth. \"Yes,\" rejoined the Patriarch of\r\nJerusalem, \"but it is not always expedient to speak the truth.\" The\r\nexcitement was great. Groups of prelates who had left the Hall might be\r\nseen standing about everywhere in earnest conversation, while within\r\ndoors Bonnechose and Cullen were discoursing to a thin audience with\r\nabsent minds. It was related that Guidi did not speak as a solitary\r\nindividual, but represented fifteen bishops belonging to the Order of\r\nDominicans. He had gathered them together in the central convent of the\r\nMinerva, where he himself resided. They had considered the question,\r\nand accepted the views which he had now presented to the Council.\r\nThis was much against the feeling of Father Jandel, their general,\r\nwho was perfectly free from any taint of the episcopal system, a\r\nthoroughly right-minded Papist. Guidi asked how the Cardinals had taken\r\nhis speech, and Cardinal Mathieu replied, \"With serious and silent\r\napproval.\"\r\n\r\nRumours were soon afloat in Rome as to what followed between Guidi\r\nand his royal master. What we now give is traced by Quirinus to the\r\nauthority of the Pope himself, who is notoriously fond of telling\r\nthe people with whom he chats how he has lectured this or that\r\ndignitary.[436]\r\n\r\nThe \"creature\" was summoned to the presence of his master soon after\r\nthe sitting, and was greeted with the words, \"You are my enemy. You\r\nare the _coryphæus_ of my opponents. Ungrateful towards my person, you\r\nhave propounded heretical doctrine.\" \"My speech is in the hands of your\r\nPresidents, if your Holiness will read it and detect what is supposed\r\nto be heretical in it. I gave it at once to the Under-Secretary, that\r\npeople might not be able to say that anything had been interpolated\r\ninto it.\"[437] \"You have given great offence to the majority of the\r\nCouncil. All five Presidents are against you, and are displeased.\"\r\n\"Some material error may have escaped me, but certainly not a formal\r\none. I have simply stated the doctrine of tradition, and of St.\r\nThomas.\" \"I am tradition. I will require you to make the profession\r\nof faith anew. _La tradizione son' io, vi faro far nuovamente la\r\nprofessione di fide._\" \"I am and remain subject to the authority of the\r\nHoly See, but I venture to discuss a question not yet made an article\r\nof faith. If your Holiness decides to be such in a Constitution, I\r\ncertainly shall not dare to oppose it.\" \"The value of your speech may\r\nbe measured by those whom it has pleased. Who has been eager to testify\r\nto you his joy? That Bishop Strossmayer, who is my personal enemy, has\r\nembraced you. You are in collusion with him.\" \"I do not know him, and\r\nhave never before spoken to him.\" \"It is clear you have spoken so as to\r\nplease the world, the Liberals, the Revolution, and the government of\r\nFlorence.\" \"Holy Father, have the goodness to have my speech given to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nIt was said that the Pope stated afterwards that he had not sent for\r\nGuidi as a Cardinal, but as Brother Guidi, whom he had himself lifted\r\nout of the dust. The saying, \"I am tradition,\" made an impression in\r\nRome much like the celebrated one of the French monarch, \"I am the\r\nState.\" It simply packed up and labelled the thought that had been\r\nmore or less confusedly before the minds of all. Quirinus speaks of\r\nhaving often had the words \"I am the Church\" in his thoughts--_l'Eglise\r\nc'est moi_. We do not see that the Pope could have said anything\r\nmore sensible or more exactly representing the theology and history\r\nwhich the favourite champions had put before the world. Quirinus very\r\nproperly thinks that this formula fits well with the pregnant saying\r\nof Boniface VIII, \"The Pope holds all rights locked up in his breast.\"\r\nTruths and rights go together. Tradition consists of truths, and the\r\nPope is all truth. Rights are based upon the truths, and the Pope\r\nholds them all in his own breast. And if the poor old man himself at\r\nlast uttered these sad words, it was only after the incense had smoked\r\naround him thousands and thousands of times, hiding the realities of\r\nheaven from him by clouds that were only fumes. For this others were\r\nresponsible, at least in part. Under the influence of it, what wonder\r\nif his senses had become confused? Mankind will have reason to be\r\nthankful that one Pope lived long enough to be thoroughly overcome by\r\nthe smoke of the sacrifices. The ordinary reason assigned in Rome for\r\nPopes being short-lived is, that it is necessary to prevent the effects\r\nof their power upon themselves.\r\n\r\nThe _gravamen_ of Guidi's offence could not be removed by any\r\nsubsequent submission. Seeing that the Canon he proposed had emerged\r\ninto the light, the record could not be got out of the book of history\r\nthat a Dominican, a divine of repute, a Cardinal in high credit, did\r\nup to that last hour of liberty hold that it was a heresy worthy of\r\nanathema to affirm the very doctrine which was soon to be part of \"the\r\nfaith.\" The record could not be prevented from going down to future\r\nages that what was, on June 18, and under the dome of St. Peter's,\r\nliable to be called a heresy, was on July 18 under the same dome,\r\npromulged by the voice of the Pope as truth, and as binding on every\r\nhuman being who would be saved. Nor can craft ever blot out from\r\nthe history of the eccentricities of intellect the instance offered\r\nby the fact that after this had been done, grave and learned men,\r\neven of advanced age and high office, went throughout the civilized\r\nworld soberly affirming that the only reason why the dogma was then\r\nproclaimed, was that it had been clearly revealed by our Lord and His\r\napostles, and had in every age been held as revealed truth by all\r\nCatholics, in all places.\r\n\r\nVitelleschi is not quite clear as to whether all the incidents reported\r\nof the interview between the Pope and the Cardinal were correct. To\r\nhim that is of no importance; Roman-like, he did not want anything to\r\nillustrate the relation of the Pope to his courtiers or to the Church.\r\nA few such scenes, more or less, would to him make no difference\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nAs if to prepare for the deeds directly tending to the restoration\r\nof facts when the Council should have completed the restoration of\r\nideas, the tales of the _Crusaders of St. Peter_ continued to appear\r\nside by side with the notices of the legislative proceedings in the\r\nsuccessive numbers of the _Civiltá_. To us one episode comes near home.\r\nIt was on an April day that a company leaving Rome bore across the\r\nCampagna, with all the solemnity of a relic of the saints, the heart\r\nof one whose body, in the Agro Verano, the cemetery of St. Lorenzo,\r\nslept close by the tombs of the ancient martyrs, and amid those of the\r\nmartyrs of Mentana. As the party reached a point on the hill within a\r\nfew steps of the village,--a point from which St. Peter's appeared in\r\nthe distance,--they saw a block of white marble, surrounded by four\r\nlittle columns, hung round by an iron chain. \"Here,\" cried some zouaves\r\nwho were of the party,--\"Here is the spot to which Julian pushed on,\r\nchasing the enemies of God with fire and sword, passing through a\r\nthousand bullets, of which one carried away his cap; and here he fell\r\nshot down at point blank.\" Above the marble block rose \"the cross of\r\nMentana,\" and on it was cut the inscription, \"Here fell, fighting\r\nfor the See of St. Peter, Julian Watts-Russell, pontifical zouave, a\r\nyoung Englishman of 17 years and 10 months old, the most youthful who\r\nfell on the field of victory, and the nearest to Mentana.\" In this\r\n\"angelic sepulchre,\" as the courtly historian calls it, the solemn\r\nparty deposited their holy relic. Around were grouped the villagers,\r\nwith a few zouaves, among whom were Mr. Vansittart, who had come to\r\ntake up the arms of his fallen friend, and Wilfred Watts-Russell, the\r\nbrother and the fellow-crusader of Julian. The rites were celebrated\r\nby a venerable old man, yet, says the narrator, a new priest, who now,\r\nperhaps, for the first time performed the funeral service. It was the\r\nfather of Julian and Wilfred. \"As we returned,\" moralizes the zealous\r\nhistorian, \"we felt that we had committed to the ground the seed of\r\nmartyrs.\"[438]\r\n\r\nAfter the Guidi incident the debate dragged on. The heats were growing\r\nworse and worse. At length, on July 2, the weary wheels seemed as\r\nif they would go no longer. The list of speakers still inscribed\r\nthreatened very considerable detention. Hefele had entered his name\r\namong the earliest, and when he applied for his turn found he was\r\nsomewhere \"in the fifties,\" and when he next applied, that he was in\r\n\"the seventies.\" Had the minority foreseen what was hidden behind\r\nclouds, but ready to thunder forth, they would perhaps have kept\r\nthe debate open; and so the Papacy would have been saved from the\r\nlast fatal step. Just now, by a strange coincidence, appeared in the\r\n_Civiltá_ the tale describing the march of the newly landed French\r\ntroops for Mentana in 1867, with their sisters of mercy. \"O France!\"\r\ncried the literary crusader, \"may the angels of God who to a field of\r\njust but terrible vengeance accompanied that host, warring only for\r\ncelestial charity, evermore protect the land of generous hearts.\"[439]\r\nBut, not knowing what was so near at hand, the minority at last\r\nreached the point at which men are ready to say, We are fighting in\r\nvain, and therefore fighting without justification. They agreed among\r\nthemselves that they might as well give up their right to speak, and\r\nlet matters be brought to a crisis. On July 4, when the Council met,\r\nSchwarzenberg and others gave up their right. The formidable name of\r\nDarboy was called. No Darboy was there. So that instead of a final\r\nargument in opposition, there was his conspicuous example in favour\r\nof withdrawing. For a long time every one who had done so had received\r\nmarks of approbation both from the Council and from the Presidents, and\r\nevery expedient had been used to induce men to abridge the discussion.\r\nIt was soon apparent that the leaders of the Opposition had adopted\r\na common policy. One after another waived his right. A couple of\r\ninconsiderable men claimed their turn, but said little. The bulk of the\r\nmen on both sides entered into the general movement, and to the relief\r\nof all, and the delight of the triumphant majority, Cardinal De Luca\r\nannounced that the list of the speakers was exhausted, and that the\r\ndebate was closed. So, as early as half-past nine o'clock, people saw\r\nthe Fathers gliding down the cathedral and dispersing over the city.\r\nThey wondered what had released them so early, and, as Vitelleschi\r\nsays, little realized the importance of their decisions, either to the\r\nChurch or to the world.\r\n\r\nDated on the very day on which the discussion closed, the _Civiltá_\r\nissued an article on the Decline of Liberalism, which shows how the\r\npolitical aspects of the legislation, now nearly completed, were kept\r\nin view.[440] A Catholic gale, says the writer, seems to be passing\r\nover the world, vivifying and gladdening society, corrupted and\r\nworm-eaten by Liberalism.\r\n\r\nA single people, the Roman, finds itself, by the special providence\r\nof God, free from this universal Liberal domination; and this Roman\r\npeople alone, still happily governed according to the laws of God, in\r\ncontradiction to the great principles of modern society, enjoys the\r\nsweet fruits of true progress, and is the object of admiration and\r\nenvy; for of it alone can it be said, Happy is the people whose God is\r\nthe Lord. As a drunken slave used to be exhibited to the Spartans to\r\ninspire them with hatred of intemperance, so Providence in almost every\r\npart of Europe has allowed slaves drunk and mad with Liberalism, slaves\r\nof tyrants sprung out of the dung-hill, to be exhibited till Europe,\r\nnow weary of Liberalism, could only look to Rome and to her civil and\r\nreligious head, not merely the sole guardian and faithful depositary,\r\nbut the infallible herald of the principles of universal religion and\r\ntruth, civilization and prosperity, even natural and social, among\r\nnations as well as among individuals. We may say that from the first\r\nstage of the movement to the last, it is nations and not individuals\r\nthat are kept in view.\r\n\r\nIn Bavaria, Belgium, and Portugal, the writer asserts, the Catholics\r\nare escaping from the trammels of the Masons. In Austria the same\r\nprocess is in preparation. In France they are more resolved than ever\r\nto sustain Rome. In Italy Liberalism is exhausted, despised, divided,\r\nand falling. \"Even in Protestant and heterodox countries, Rome, with\r\nher civil and religious prince, stands in much higher credit than Italy\r\nand other Liberal governments apparently stronger.\"\r\n\r\nSneering at an allusion of the _Journal des Débats_ to the vaunted\r\nhopes of the Catholics, accompanied by the remark that in spite of\r\ntheir absurdity it was nevertheless prudent to keep an eye on the\r\nclock which was to sound the return of the hour for great things the\r\n_Civiltá_ says it will not deny that Liberalism has some \"bad quarters\r\nof an hour\" before it. It equally thinks that now it is neither\r\nimprudent nor rash \"to hope, and that within a time not remote, for the\r\nvictory of Rome and its Pontiff-king, so far as Italy is concerned, and\r\nfor the victory of the social, civil, and religious principles which\r\nthat king represents and preclaims.\"\r\n\r\nThe triumph over intellect it holds to be patent and ascertained, and\r\ntherefore this hope of a triumph in facts is reasonable.\r\n\r\nProvidence, continues the soothsayer, cannot permit the Church to be\r\nlong the victim of the devices of the gates of hell, particularly\r\nof those devices with which the States of the Church are now beset.\r\nAfter making allusion to hopes which had been entertained of the\r\nPope's death, and asserting his florid health and his prospect of\r\nliving many years, he proceeds: \"The Pontiff lives and reigns in\r\nRome more secure, more glorious, more influential, more beloved than\r\nhis enemies.\" Not only is the fact that this potentate was defended\r\nby the arms of France entirely absent from the consciousness of\r\nthe writer, but he indulges in jibes clearly addressed to the very\r\nEmperor who had restored the Pontiff and kept him up. \"Sound Catholic\r\nprinciples now seem to politicians the only support of material order\r\nand of economical interests.\" The writer goes on to show that all the\r\nimplements of Liberalism have been employed on behalf of the Papacy,\r\nand that with success--meetings, addresses, collections, votes,\r\nilluminations.\r\n\r\nWriting with an expectation that before its words came under the eye\r\nof his readers (p. 174) they would have already learned that the great\r\nword had been spoken, and that Papal infallibility had taken its place\r\namong revealed truths, the writer proceeds to indicate the range of the\r\nnew attribute:--\r\n\r\n    The Roman Pontiff is the Vicar of Christ. Therefore is he the\r\n    continuator of the work of Christ in the world. He, standing in His\r\n    stead, is the witness to the truth in the midst of us. Christ is\r\n    the voice of the Father, and the Pontiff is the voice of Christ.\r\n    The Father, in the fulness of time, spake unto us by His Son. The\r\n    Son, after His return to the Father, continues to speak to us by\r\n    His Vicar. Now, is it conceivable that a lie can ever be found in\r\n    such a mouth, in such a word?--and if it could be found, would\r\n    not the mission of Christ and the duration of His reign have\r\n    vanished _ipso facto_? Affirming the infallibility of the Pontiff,\r\n    therefore, means no less than affirming the duration of the reign\r\n    of Christ upon earth.\r\n\r\nMany who, on beginning to read this work, would have shrunk from\r\ninterpreting language as to the Kingdom of Christ or the reign of\r\nChrist in the Jesuit sense, will by this time be prepared to see how\r\na fallen faith which in effect brings down our Lord to the level of\r\nthe Pope, must impress itself on the language of those who hold it.\r\nAny thoughtful man who will spend a few minutes in calmly setting out\r\nbefore his mind the ideas here shown to rule the mind of a Jesuit,\r\nwill ever after attach a more definite meaning to the language of\r\nUltramontanes when they speak of the Word of God, the Kingdom of God,\r\nthe Christian civil system, or use any other terms, affecting the\r\nrelative positions of the Pope and of the rest of the human race.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this article gratefully recognizes the surpassing zeal of\r\nFrance and her title to the first place among nations devoted to the\r\nChurch. Those who form exceptions to the general devotion of France\r\ndo not belong to her. The Opposition in the Council are called the\r\nnew Arians, a clear analogy being discerned between denying to our\r\nLord His divinity and denying to the Pope his place as the infallible\r\nrepresentative of the Lord. The dogma, continues the _Civiltá_, would\r\nnow come forth with the double advantage of an acclamation and a\r\ndiscussion. The famous petition for the definition, by a vast majority\r\nof the bishops, was indeed an acclamation, and to this had been added\r\nan ample discussion. It asserts that there never had been in the\r\nhistory of the world so full and exhaustive an examination of any\r\nquestion. The writer is unconscious of the fact that before changing\r\na principle of law, or even a fiscal arrangement like a duty on corn,\r\nwe slow English sometimes employ as many years as they had employed\r\nmonths in settling the source of all principles for ever. Not only\r\nso, but with us each new thread shot into the progressive web of the\r\ndiscussion is laid bare to every eye and to every magnifying glass\r\nthat nature and art can lend. The _Civiltá_ puts in even the word\r\n\"ventilated\" among the epithets denoting the unparalleled winnowing of\r\nthis great question. Why, the _Civiltá_ itself, during the progress\r\nof the discussion, readily told, indeed, who celebrated mass, who\r\ndied, who received a title, a distinction, or a place, who got leave\r\nto stay away; but it did not even tell who spoke, much less anything\r\nabout what was said. It gave not a word of information to the whole\r\nCatholic Church of what was proposed to be done with its creed, or of\r\nwhat the assembled bishops thought of the proposal. In the very same\r\nvolume where these fine words are written, we have this specimen of the\r\n_Civiltá's_ history, with which we connect one from Monsignor Guérin,\r\nas showing what free air will blow around the chairs of history in\r\nour colleges and around the tables of our editors when once dogma has\r\nachieved its Sedan (VII. xi. 237). \"Our readers will be gratified\"--a\r\nblundering English journalist would have commenced such a paragraph\r\nwith apologies for not being able to tell his readers anything worth\r\nknowing, but the accomplished Jesuit begins with congratulating them\r\non the amount of information he is about to give--\"Our readers will be\r\ngratified to have under their eyes a view of how many spoke, or gave up\r\nthe right of speaking, in the discussion on the 4th chapter,\"--that is,\r\non the great chapter containing the express statement of infallibility.\r\n\r\n June 15, 1 Reporter and 2 Speakers.\r\n June 18, 3 Speakers.\r\n June 20, 1 Reporter and 4 Speakers.\r\n June 22, 7 Speakers.\r\n June 23, 5 Speakers.\r\n June 25, 6 Speakers and 2 gave up their right.\r\n June 28, 6 Speakers.\r\n June 30, 6 Speakers and 2 gave up their right.\r\n July 1, 6 Speakers.\r\n July 2, 9 Speakers and 14 gave up their right.\r\n July 4, 2 Speakers and 42 gave up their right.\r\n\r\nThe excellent Monsignor says (p. 113),--and it is for thoughtful men\r\nto spend a little time in forming a clear idea of what would be the\r\ncondition of the world if its information on its supreme affairs was\r\nsupplied in this fashion:--\r\n\r\n    There were General Congregations on the 8th of January, the 10th,\r\n    the 14th, the 15th, the 18th, the 19th, the 21st, the 22nd, the\r\n    24th, the 25th, the 27th, the 31st, on the 3rd of February, the\r\n    4th, the 7th, the 8th, the 10th, the 14th, the 15th, the 18th, the\r\n    21st, the 22nd. An interruption of the General Congregations for\r\n    a month; a resumption of the Congregation on the 18th of March,\r\n    (thirtieth Congregation), the 22nd, the 23rd, the 25th, the 26th,\r\n    the 28th, the 29th, the 30th, the 31st, the 1st of April, the 4th,\r\n    the 5th, the 6th, the 7th, the 8th, the 12th, the 19th.\r\n\r\nWe do not know why this instructive method of writing the most\r\nimportant of histories, that of the process of making laws for the\r\nwhole world, is not continued through and through. Vestments and\r\nprocessions, bulls or Papal briefs, are not in the same manner hidden\r\nbehind Arabic numerals. Any one may, at the British Museum, feast his\r\nown eyes on a specimen of such luminous history. The seventh volume of\r\nFrond is the History of the Council. The student will find it a folio\r\nin sumptuous Morocco, with gilt edges, and paper thicker than vellum.\r\nHe will find it faultless and very full in matters of rank, precedence,\r\nforms and ceremonies; each cope and favour, each lappet, and each heave\r\nof the censer is well and duly noted. But as to questions respecting\r\nwhat men thought, said, proposed, deprecated, or took delight in, the\r\npoor student may open three leaves in succession and find both sides\r\nfilled with mere numerals, names, and titles.[441] One grave historical\r\nerror is confessed in the corrigenda. On a certain occasion even the\r\npen guided by the \"radiance of infallibility\" slipped so far as to say\r\nthat their Eminences the Cardinals were to be in black stockings. The\r\ncorrection shows that \"black slippers\" were the proper words.\r\n\r\nIt would for a time have seemed as if the glories once foretold to\r\nfollow the dogma had considerably faded from the eyes of the seers\r\nduring the wearying months of debate. Now, however, that the goal was\r\nin sight, the vistas reopened, and if translucent clouds rendered the\r\ndistant view indistinct, they greatly enhanced its splendour. Still\r\nthere was no weak expectation that the great results would be instantly\r\nattained. As centuries were required to bring the Anti-Papal movement\r\nin society to the present pass, so was it calculated that centuries\r\nwould be required to bring the counter-movement to its full development.\r\n\r\n    It is not to be believed that an event so glorious, and one brought\r\n    about by God with dispensations so singular, is to remain confined\r\n    within itself. It will be prolific of prodigious effects in every\r\n    social sphere for the salvation of the _nations_. God does not\r\n    work by accident, or set in motion great means for small ends. We\r\n    do not hesitate to affirm that just as the subversive negations of\r\n    authority which prevailed at the Council of Basle indicated the\r\n    principles of the great politico-religious revolution of modern\r\n    times, so the reparative affirmation of all the privileges of the\r\n    See of Peter now so solemnly made by the Vatican Council will\r\n    indicate the principles of restoration in every public and private\r\n    sphere of Christendom. Hence in the series of the centuries this\r\n    of ours will be a day blest and magnified as that in which, thanks\r\n    to the Council held under Pio Nono, the light again dawned on an\r\n    oppressed world wrapped up in the darkness of the Revolution (pp.\r\n    178-9).\r\n\r\nThe writer does not overlook us non-Catholics. For us also the great\r\nevent was pregnant with blessing, showing us, above all things, \"the\r\ndivine organization of the Church,\" and in it showing us the \"remedy\r\nfor the unbridled excesses of private judgment, the parent of that\r\nBabel confusion in which we are involved.\" Therefore,\r\n\r\n    to Mary, sweet Lady and Queen of this kingdom of Christ, be loving\r\n    thanksgivings rendered, for after God to her favour do we trace the\r\n    benefit obtained. Scarcely had we read in the Bull of Convocation\r\n    that the Council would open its sittings on the day sacred to the\r\n    Immaculate Conception of Mary, before we felt a firm and immovable\r\n    hope of the definition of pontifical infallibility. It was fitting\r\n    that the Pontiff who, amid the applause of the Christian world, had\r\n    dogmatically asserted the highest prerogatives of her holiness,\r\n    should himself behold the highest prerogatives of his apostolic\r\n    ministry dogmatically affirmed (p. 180).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 425: It seems that the Bishop of Orleans, and most of the\r\nFrench prelates in opposition, wished to make a solemn protest against\r\nthe treatment they had met with; against the advantage taken of the hot\r\nseason to weary them; against the want of fairness shown towards them\r\nby the Presidents all through the discussion; and, lastly, against the\r\nexcesses, insults, and affronts of which the majority had been guilty\r\nwith regard to them.

On the very next day, however, after the close of the great\r\ndiscussion, occurred a collision which, had the opposition been morally\r\ncapable of saving anything, would have given it the opportunity of\r\nsaving the Roman Catholic Church from falling into the condition of a\r\nbody without any constitution, except the \"inner light\" of one man. It\r\nopened their eyes, perhaps not more widely, but once more. It smote\r\ntheir feelings, excited a momentary effort at action, and ended in a\r\nprotest drawn up by Bishop Dinkel.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday the Fathers were studying sixty-two amendments proposed on\r\nthe second chapter of the great Decree. It seemed awful work to decide\r\nso many points affecting the faith on a single Monday morning! But\r\nbehold, in the evening come in one hundred and twenty-two amendments on\r\nthe fourth chapter, to be voted upon on the Tuesday!\r\n\r\nThe procedure was on this wise. Amendments suggested, after being in\r\nthe hands of the Committee, were reported in print, and then put to the\r\nvote. The Sub-Secretary said, The committee oppose the amendment: let\r\nthose who oppose it stand up. Or, The Committee accept the amendment:\r\nlet those who accept it stand up. So by scores at a time were questions\r\nsettled on which men had had no chance of reflecting. Only once, says\r\n_La Liberté du Concile_, did the Fathers succeed in obtaining from\r\nthe Presidents a delay. It was on the very occasion just mentioned,\r\nwhen they showed that the only time permitted to them to read over the\r\nhundred and twenty-two amendments to be despatched on the Tuesday,\r\nwould be what would be left of the Monday after they had despatched no\r\nless than sixty-two. They did obtain twenty-four hours' extension of\r\nthe time. \"You are convoked on purpose to vote,\" says the writer, who,\r\nbe it remembered, printed only fifty copies, for Cardinals alone, \"and\r\nyou have not time to study not even to read it over again\" (Doc. i. p.\r\n175).\r\n\r\nIf ever an important act was passed by an assembly it was the Canon\r\nwhich closes the third chapter of the great Vatican Decree. Quirinus\r\nhardly exaggerates its importance when he speaks of it, if interpreted\r\nby the rules of Canon law, as handing over the bodies and souls of all\r\nmen to one. On July 5, the Fathers had in print before them a formula\r\nfor this Canon, and three proposed amendments. The Bishop of Rovigo,\r\nas reporter for the committee, broke all rule first by saying that\r\namendments No. 70 and 71 should not be voted upon, as the committee had\r\nadopted No. 72, with a modification. It would appear that, utter as was\r\nthe disregard here manifested even of the Pope's own Rules as well as\r\nof the rights of the proposers of the amendments and of those of the\r\nCouncil, this was allowed to pass. But soon even that broken-spirited\r\nOpposition was roused. It was plain to some that what the Bishop read\r\nas No. 72 was not what was in print as 72. The Presidents wanted to put\r\nwhat had been read, but then, according to the _Acta Sanctæ Sedis_,\r\narose Haynald and protested. Though the Council itself had no right to\r\nshape the amendments, the Rules required that all amendments should be\r\nput before it as they had been shaped by the committee, and it was for\r\nthe Council to say Yea or Nay. Darboy also rose, and more fully entered\r\nhis protest. The protest could not at the moment be brushed aside. Here\r\nwas obviously a proposal differing from that of the committee, foisted\r\nin against all rule, and without notice. For once the prohibition\r\nagainst speaking to order had been defied. The Presidents, thrown\r\ninto confusion, could not conceal the attempted trick; yet they durst\r\nnot abandon the spurious Canon. They therefore said something about\r\ninadvertence, and withdrew it for the present, to be submitted to the\r\ncommittee, then to be printed and voted upon at another time.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that the difference between the two forms involved the\r\nwhole question of jurisdiction between bishops and Pope. One form had\r\nbeen withdrawn by the committee, and an amendment had been accepted.\r\nThe Pope was incensed. He ordered the third Canon to be altered back\r\nto the form which had been objected to, and even this was greatly\r\nstrengthened. He never submitted the alteration to the committee, but\r\nsent it direct to the reporter to be then and there put to the vote\r\ninstead of the Canon which stood on the printed Order of the Day.\r\nHow great was the difference in the wording of what the Fathers had\r\nbefore them in print, and what was attempted to be palmed upon them, is\r\nobvious on reading the two--\r\n\r\n\r\n THE CANON AS IT WAS IN                      THE CANON AS IT WAS READ\r\n PRINT                                       AND ATTEMPTED TO BE PUT\r\n                                             TO THE VOTE\r\n\r\n If any shall say that the                 If any one shall say that the\r\n Primacy of the Roman Pontiff              Roman Pontiff has only an\r\n is only an office of supervision          office of supervision or\r\n and direction, and that his               direction, but not plenary and\r\n supreme jurisdiction over the             supreme power over the whole\r\n universal Church is not plenary,          Church, both in things\r\n but only extraordinary and                pertaining to faith and morals,\r\n mediate, let him be anathema.             and also in those pertaining to\r\n                                           the discipline and government of\r\n                                           the Church dispersed through all\r\n                                           the earth, or that he has only\r\n                                           the chief portion but not the\r\n                                           entire fulness of this supreme\r\n                                           power, or that this his power is\r\n                                           not ordinary and immediate,\r\n                                           whether over the Churches all\r\n                                           and singular, or over pastors\r\n                                           and believers all and singular,\r\n                                           let him be anathema.\r\n\r\nMeditation on what was involved in these claims to all-absorbing\r\npower was not likely to relieve the bishops of the pain caused by the\r\nstealthy attempt upon their vote. What the Presiding Cardinals and\r\nthe Bishop of Rovigo had tried to steal from them, was not trash. It\r\nwas all that ancient bishops, even when acknowledging the primacy of\r\nRome, would have fought for with at least ecclesiastical weapons. Of\r\nthe Committee not a man spoke his scorn, and the steady majority was\r\nnot shaken. The world accused it of conspiring against the rights\r\nand liberties of mankind. It might full as well have been accused of\r\nconspiring against the rights and liberties of bishops. If the official\r\norgans had often, during the Council, used such language as \"lying\" and\r\nso forth, they were quiet now, while words like \"lying,\" \"cheating,\"\r\n\"deceiving,\" etc., flew freely about, and, if Quirinus be correct, were\r\nrepeatedly used in the meetings of the bishops of the minority.\r\n\r\nBut if the majority was not disturbed, a note rang out from the French\r\nminority which might remind any one who has lived in their country\r\nthrough a revolution, of the _Prend ton sac_--Take thy sack!--the three\r\nsudden taps which at such a time make timid hearts in a house beat as\r\nif they had been hit by the drumstick.\r\n\r\n    \"1. The hour of Providence has struck,\" cries this voice, with\r\n    the true French ring. \"The decisive moment for saving the Church\r\n    has arrived. 2. By the additions made to the third Canon of\r\n    the third chapter, the committee, _de fide_, has violated the\r\n    Rules, which permit not the introduction of any amendment without\r\n    discussion by the Council. 3. The addition surreptitiously made\r\n    is of importance beyond calculation. It changes the constitution\r\n    of the Church. It enacts the monarchy of the Pope pure, absolute,\r\n    and indivisible. It carries the abolition of the judicial\r\n    rights and the co-sovereignty of the bishops, and with it the\r\n    affirmation and anticipatory definition of separate and personal\r\n    infallibility. 4. Duty and honour permit us not to vote this Canon\r\n    without discussion, as it contains an immense revolution. The\r\n    discussion can and may last six months, for it affects the capital\r\n    question, the very constitution of the sovereign power in the\r\n    Church. 5. This discussion is impossible, because of the pressure\r\n    of the season and the disposition of the majority. 6. One thing\r\n    alone, worthy and honourable, remains to be done--to demand the\r\n    immediate prorogation of the Council till the month of October,\r\n    and to present a declaration, in which all the protests already\r\n    sent in shall be enumerated, and the last violation of the Rules\r\n    shall be set forth, as well as the contempt shown to the dignity\r\n    and liberty of the bishops. At the same time, we must give notice\r\n    of our intended departure, which can no longer be deferred. 7.\r\n    By the departure, on such grounds, of a considerable number of\r\n    bishops of all nations, the oecumenicity of the Council would be\r\n    at an end, and all acts which it might subsequently adopt would be\r\n    null in point of authority. 8. The courage and devotedness of the\r\n    minority would produce an immense effect in the world. The Council\r\n    would meet in the month of October in circumstances vastly more\r\n    favourable. All the questions now only broached would be taken up\r\n    again and treated with dignity and liberty. The Church would be\r\n    saved, and the moral order of the world.\"[442]\r\n\r\nHad this energetic advice been adopted, the Roman Catholic Church would\r\nfor the time have been saved from the last step in a downward series;\r\nbut whether the moral order of the world would have been the better is\r\nanother question. Those who seek a moral order higher than could be\r\ngiven by the men who attempted to palm the new Canon upon the Council,\r\nmay well be content to have the lines drawn and the forces defined. The\r\nCouncil has given to all men an opportunity of knowing, if they will,\r\nwhat are the morals of the Pope and his officers, and what is order\r\nin their vocabulary. The moral order of the world must now be secured\r\neither under the absolute dominion of the Pontiff, or, as it has been\r\nbest secured before, over the remains of his pretensions.\r\n\r\nBut the bishops of the minority were not the men to give the Church a\r\nfurther chance of continuing that confusion of all moral order which\r\nresulted from her old ambiguities. They did now as they had done\r\nbefore--let her take her way, and sent in a protest stating the main\r\nfacts of the deception and breach of Rules.[443] One can almost see the\r\nsmiles of the men in power at the sight of one piece of paper more.\r\n\r\nIf ever there was a case to justify the hasty saying ascribed to\r\nBurke, that Protestantism is a mere negation, it was that of the\r\nVatican minority always protesting and never maintaining its ground.\r\nOf course, every protest has its negative side, but that is the\r\nside turned towards him who is protested against. It always has its\r\npositive side; that is, the side of him who makes the protest. He\r\nasserts a right. Dr. Newman, in a moment of sound sense, said, \"What\r\nis the very meaning of the word 'Protestantism,' but that there is\r\na call to speak out?\"[444] So, when in a day of mercy, nations,\r\nhearing from heaven a call to speak out, protested against the sins\r\nand follies of the Pontiff, their protest was indeed a mere negation\r\nto him whose pretensions were rolled back; but to those who made\r\nthe protest good, it was a positive upholding of existing rights, a\r\npositive recovery of lapsed rights, a positive deliverance from great\r\nevils, and a positive entrance into possession of great and heritable\r\ngood. They protested against the doctrinal authority of the Pontiff,\r\nand maintained the doctrinal authority of the Bible. They protested\r\nagainst the authority of ecclesiastical courts or Councils to fetter\r\nthe press, the pulpit, or the private conscience. In doing so, they\r\nmaintained a duty imposed, and a right given, by God. The negative\r\nresult was to the Inquisition and the Curia. The positive result was\r\nto the Press, the Pulpit, the Civil Court, and the silent tribunal of\r\nthe Soul, with its reinstated jury of accusing and excusing thoughts.\r\nThey protested against indulgences, purgatory, and all the commerce of\r\nthe mass, and maintained the free gift of God's unpurchaseable grace,\r\nthe sovereignty of His judgment, the finished and all-perfect sacrifice\r\nof His Son. They protested against sensuous and idolatrous spectacle,\r\nand upheld scriptural worship; protested against colours, scents, and\r\ngorgeous dress, and upheld sound teaching, borrowing all its glory\r\nfrom spiritual elements, none from physical; they protested against\r\npriestly caste, and upheld a brotherhood, a royal nation of priests;\r\nthey protested against progressive conformity to newly-invented\r\nsuperstitions, against the service of local and subordinate divinities,\r\nand at the same time upheld progressive conformity to the standard of\r\nour Lord and His apostles. They protested against the idea of one fold\r\nor one pen, but upheld that of one flock diversified in its members,\r\nvarious in its folds, but one in love to the common Lord and in\r\nlikeness to the common Father.\r\n\r\nWhen Darboy and Dupanloup, on July 4, gave up the attempt of averting\r\nthe definition by delay, how little did they know that a couple of\r\ndays later and the whole prospect of the Papacy would be changed.\r\nWhen the Pope on the morrow of that day followed up his victory by\r\nthe additional blow which the surreptitious Canon dealt at the very\r\nsemblance of liberty or rule in the Council, how little did he suspect\r\nthat the visions of restoration long floating before his fancy were to\r\ngive place to real scenes of fresh disaster. It was only on June 10\r\nthat Ollivier, in the Chamber of Deputies, gave confident assurances\r\nof peace, while on July 6, in the same Chamber, Gramont sounded an\r\nunmistakable blast of war. Even now, human foresight did not measure\r\nthe rapidity with which events were to rush to a collision, and then\r\nto a catastrophe. Napoleon III had so often seemed bent on measuring\r\nhimself with Prussia, and had so often drawn back, that it was not\r\nunreasonable to hope that, even after bellicose words, he might be\r\nprudent once more.\r\n\r\nThe next week following that day which placed in hazard the fortunes\r\nof the restorer of the Papacy and those of the Papacy itself, was\r\nspent in the Council in voting the chapters in their final shape. The\r\nCanon which had been brought surreptitiously forward on the fifth was\r\nproduced in the regular manner on the thirteenth, and after all the\r\noutcry it was passed; \"the most pregnant article,\" says Quirinus,\r\n\"that had been laid before any Council for six hundred years.\" It\r\nwas now voted by rising and sitting,--which is not to be wondered\r\nat when originally the Presidents had wanted it to be voted without\r\nbeing even known. We must not blame the minority for not now debating\r\nit. The Rules did not allow of this. It had been adopted by the\r\ncommittee and must be met with a Yea or Nay. How many voted against\r\nthis pregnant act is uncertain. Some say fifty or sixty, some ninety\r\nor a hundred.[445] In that act every shred and tatter of the Gallican\r\nliberties, or any other liberties, except that of doing the Pope's\r\nwill, passed from the Papal officers, whom, as Quirinus says, the\r\nRoman Chancery still calls bishops. The chapter to which this Canon\r\nwas attached annulled all national rights whatever, whether Gallican,\r\nJosephine, or parliamentary, which might conflict with the supreme\r\nauthority. Vitelleschi (p. 202) says that the Secretary of State\r\nappeared very uneasy as to the opinion of governments on this fresh\r\ndeclaration. The bishops naturally would have similar apprehensions,\r\nbut as to them, fear cast out fear. They had good reason to believe\r\nin the gentleness of Liberal governments, and they had no reason to\r\nbelieve in the gentleness of the Pope. They trusted, says Vitelleschi,\r\nto the tolerance and freedom of thought which has everywhere triumphed\r\nin modern days. With the Papal government, on the other hand, they had\r\nneither tolerance nor freedom to trust to. They knew that if they dared\r\nto provoke it, the stroke of Pius IX would come down hot and heavy.\r\nThe oath of a bishop to the Pope, which obviously aims more at feudal\r\nvassalage than at spiritual works, had made the Emperor Joseph II feel\r\nthat men bound by it were not citizens in the sense of free men. \"It\r\ndoes not accord with the fidelity or obedience due by a bishop, as a\r\nsubject, to his sovereign.... A bishop who feels himself bound by that\r\noath must become perjured.\"[446]\r\n\r\nMany writers mention what is clearly stated in a letter of Hefele,\r\nunder date of July 9:--[447]\r\n\r\n    The intention of the Pope is, in spite of the minority, to proceed\r\n    at once to the publication of the new dogma, and forthwith to hand\r\n    to every bishop two documents for his signature: (1) A profession\r\n    of faith containing the article of infallibility; (2) A solemn\r\n    declaration that the Council has been a free one. So you see into\r\n    what a position we are brought, and that it does not depend on our\r\n    own will whether we shall remain in our places or not. He that\r\n    will not sign will instantly be placed under censure.\r\n\r\nAccording to Vitelleschi, this threat terrified the poor bishops of the\r\nOpposition. If they refused to acknowledge the validity of the Council,\r\nnothing, as he says, was before them but to resign their Sees. If they\r\nmeant to impugn the validity of the Council, Rome was not the place in\r\nwhich to do it, and, what is still more significant, they themselves\r\n\"were not the men to do it.\"\r\n\r\nIt proved on the next day that the candidature of a Hohenzollern prince\r\nfor the vacant crown of Spain, which had given to France the occasion\r\nfor a quarrel, had been withdrawn. But it also appeared that Lord Lyons\r\nhad to reproach the Duke De Gramont with a breach of promise, inasmuch\r\nas the Duke had authorized him to assure her Majesty's Government that\r\nif the withdrawal of the prince could only be procured the affair would\r\nbe at an end. It was plain that the long-prophesied attack of France\r\nwas resolved upon at last. What with the impatience of the majority for\r\nthe fruits of their victory and the disgust and discouragement of the\r\nminority, the sufferings from the heat and the solicitude occasioned by\r\napproaching war, the assembly had ceased to be, in any serious sense\r\nof the word, deliberative. Amendments literally by the score were now\r\nproduced and disposed of with a haste which was in shocking contrast\r\nwith the gravity of the subjects. _La Liberté du Concile_ says that on\r\nthe all-important chapters on faith there were proposed two hundred\r\nand eighty-one amendments. The Fathers were called on to vote them by\r\nstanding and sitting, and this was done in such haste that they had\r\nnot even time to re-read them. The Under-Secretary did not read them\r\nout. He cried, \"Number ten, number fifty, or number seventy-seven,\"\r\nas the case might be, \"the committee rejects: those who are in favour\r\nof its rejection stand up.\" The solid majority stood up, and all was\r\nover. So in another case he cried out, \"Number five or fifteen,\" adding\r\n\"The committee accepts: those who are in favour of accepting stand\r\nup\"; and the same result. \"I do not vote,\" said one bishop, \"because\r\nnot only am I unable to form a conviction, but I am unable even to\r\nform a clear idea of what is the point\" (_Documenta_, i. 174). And\r\neach minutest point was to be irreformably fixed! We had, says this\r\nwriter, four hundred quarto pages on the subject of infallibility,\r\nincluding notes, remarks, and all, while only a few days were allowed\r\nto study it. So when the Draft Decrees on Faith were for the second\r\ntime brought out new cast, with a preamble, four chapters, and eighteen\r\ncanons, twenty-four hours were allowed to prepare to discuss them; and\r\nthe preparation must be in Latin. Twenty-four hours for an accountable\r\ncreature of God to prepare himself to say whether he would take a side\r\nfor or against laying upon himself the obligation to pronounce eighteen\r\ncurses more against his fellow creatures!\r\n\r\nThe hope had been flattered all along that no anathema would be\r\nattached to the dogma of infallibility. But at the very last Bishop\r\nGasser, of Brixen, one of the keen Curialists, produced the formula\r\nenriched with an anathema against any one who should presume to\r\ncontradict it. Quirinus says that Gasser was unwilling to be left\r\nbehind by Manning, Deschamps, Dreux-Brézé, and the Spaniards. Finally\r\nthe whole was submitted to the solemn decision on that very day on\r\nwhich the French Chamber, that had so long voted money for the forces\r\nto support the Papacy in Rome, voted five hundred and fifteen millions\r\nof francs to break up united Germany once more.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of July 13 the hour had come. Up to the last it had been\r\nasserted that no bishops but two or three would say _Non placet_. Every\r\nform of assurance had been spoken and printed that this would prove\r\nto be the case. The Virgin, the Saints, ay, and even the Holy Spirit,\r\nhad been over and over again pledged to procure this result. At last,\r\nKetteler and Landriot of Rheims made a clever attempt to bring it about\r\nby proposing to the Opposition, with which they had seemed to be at\r\none, that they should all vote _Placet juxta modum_ (content on certain\r\nconditions).[448] This would have enabled the Court to say that there\r\nwere no votes of \"non-content.\" The Archbishop of Milan said, \"The\r\nonly befitting course for us who are convinced of the falsehood of the\r\ndoctrine is to say, No.\"[449] The Pope, it is said, told Darboy that\r\nnot above ten would vote _Non placet_.[450] Certain it is that bets\r\nwould have been freely taken in Rome the night before that not a dozen\r\nwould do so. The devout were confident because the Virgin would order\r\nit otherwise, and the worldly were confident because they thought the\r\nbishops would not be unmindful of their own interests.\r\n\r\nThe Hall once more received its aged senators. Eighteen centuries\r\ncalled to them to remember what a Church Christ had set up; how pure in\r\nprinciple, how free in regulations, how plain in forms, how simple in\r\norganization, how far from pomp or dreams of domination, from cursing,\r\nor from use of physical force; how little of a body, how much of a\r\nspirit, was that real Church. It was a leaven moving by the force of\r\nan inward and self-propagating life to leaven the whole lump, in which\r\nfor itself it only asked to lie hidden, and by its innate force to\r\ndetermine the quality of the meal, not stooping to design a mould for\r\nthe shape of the loaves, on a model as irreformable as the patterns of\r\na Hindu artisan. Many bishops had said that they had found themselves\r\ncalled together to gratify one self-asserting man of ordinary gifts,\r\nand less than ordinary acquirements, by giving him a diploma as the\r\ntitular Lord of the world, which would have no practical effect except\r\nthat of making him dictator of the Church, and bringing them and\r\ntheir people into collision with everything bright and noble, which\r\nhe, in his infatuation, had set himself to put down. Many of them, at\r\nconsiderable risk to their own interests, were determined to register\r\ntheir solemn No! In spite of all hopes previously entertained, the\r\nfeeling that the minority were resolved had spread among the majority.\r\nQuirinus tells how Deschamps, who had drafted a set of supererogatory\r\nanathemas, and had only withdrawn them in face of serious threats\r\nfrom Maret, and who was therefore known as having sought to place\r\nevery man of the minority in the dilemma between giving an instant\r\naffirmative vote, or being immediately outside the Church by anathema,\r\nnow approached the leaders of the Opposition. \"With humble gestures\r\nand whining voice,\" he entreated them to do as Ketteler and Landriot,\r\nprofesedly belonging to them, had proposed, namely, to vote \"Content on\r\ncertain conditions,\" and said that really there was a disposition on\r\nthe part of the authorities to insert qualifications. \"The trick was\r\ntoo bare-faced to succeed.\" Darboy called the attention of the three\r\nCardinals to this attempt to divide the Opposition at the last, and the\r\nbishops said to the new Primate of Belgium, on whose head the gifted\r\nalready saw the mitre kindling into the flame-colour of a hat, \"It is\r\nunexampled impudence.\" We shall find hereafter, in the _Acta Sanctæ\r\nSedis_, what would appear to be an allusion to this scene.\r\n\r\nThe voting then began. It appeared that there were six hundred and\r\none bishops present, showing that many of those who were in the city\r\nhad stayed away. Antonelli was not there. Of course all the men\r\nbelonging to Rome and the patrimony of St. Peter were for the Pope. So\r\nwere nearly all those of the Neapolitan States, and the overwhelming\r\nmajority from the other portions of Italy; Spain, South America, and\r\nthe missionary bishops, might be said to be as one man. But to the\r\nsurprise of every one, several of the Orientals, under the Propaganda\r\nas they were, and terrorized as they had been, had the heart to say No.\r\nEven poor old Audu, Patriarch of Chaldea, dared to say _Non placet_,\r\nknowing, from his experience by night in the Vatican, to what he might\r\nbe exposed. Of course Ballerini and Valerga, and other Romans, whose\r\nOrientalism went no deeper than their vestments, were Roman still. When\r\nthe important preliminary votes had been taken by rising and sitting,\r\nthe Sub-Secretary ascended the pulpit. He called out name after name,\r\neach one replying by the words, _Placet, Non placet_, or _Placet juxta\r\nmodum_; that is, Content, Not Content, or Conditionally Content. The\r\nvast majority said _Placet_; but the stateliest of Cardinals, Prince\r\nSchwarzenberg, said No. Milan said No; Paris, No; Munich, No; Vienna,\r\nNo; Gran, the Primatial See of Hungary, No; Lyons, the Primatial See\r\nof France, No. In all, no less than eighty-eight living witnesses that\r\nday lifted up their testimony, and sent it on to all after-time, that,\r\nso far as they knew, the doctrine of Papal infallibility had not been,\r\nand was not then, the faith of the Churches which they represented.\r\nNearly all these did represent Churches, many of them the oldest, the\r\nmost educated, and the most numerous in the Papal world. Maret, who was\r\na bishop _in partibus_, being among the minority, was like a bird in\r\nthe wrong flock.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, no less than seven Cardinals then present in Rome\r\nabstained from voting. The abstentions altogether numbered eighty.\r\nPoor Cardinal Guidi, who had been sadly belaboured for his fault, had\r\nbeen forbidden to receive visitors, and had been made miserable by all\r\nthe arts which priests can practise, and to which priests are exposed,\r\nnow voted _Juxta modum_; that is, conditionally content. The number\r\nwho did the same were sixty-two. A false impression was spread among\r\nthe Liberal Catholics that these were all adverse to the definition.\r\nNot so. Some of them did not think the formula now before them strong\r\nenough, and had notable additions to propose. The Contents were, 451;\r\nthe Non-contents, 88; and the Conditional Contents, 62.[451] The _Acta_\r\nof the Council contain not a syllable of this sitting, any more than of\r\nall the others of the General Congregations.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this vote in Rome was immense. No class of men had\r\ncounted upon it. Even ardent supporters of the minority had shown a\r\nwant of any confidence that they would stand fast up to this point. The\r\nimpression got abroad, for the moment, that not even Pius IX, little\r\ndelicate as he was, would accept an apotheosis, as it was called,\r\nwhich had been publicly discredited by nearly all the bishops of\r\ngreat Sees, who were in any sense independent of the Bishop of Rome.\r\n\"According to general belief, especially in Rome,\" says Vitelleschi\r\n(p. 206), \"the Church never creates a dogma new in itself; but in\r\ndefining a dogma, simply attests some belief which has been always and\r\nuniversally professed.\" The Romans saw that both the \"always\" and\r\nthe \"universally\" were for ever disproved by the vote. They knew how\r\nspeedily black could be made white, but they did not see how the device\r\ncould this time succeed. There was the vote, saying what had been the\r\nbelief of the bishops up to that hour. But probably the Romans soon\r\ncorrected their first impression by their habitual estimate of Pius\r\nIX. They never accuse him of pride, although they always accuse him of\r\nvanity and vainglory. A case in which the common voice so sharply draws\r\nthe distinction is exceedingly rare in public life. He is not above\r\naccepting anything that is agreeable. Quirinus will have it that he\r\nstill declared that the vote of the Opposition would be reversed, and\r\nthat these misguided men would be so enlightened by the Holy Spirit,\r\nthat they would publicly vote for the right.\r\n\r\nFrom Munich a telegram was sent to Hefele bearing many names, among\r\nthem that of Reithmayer, announcing universal \"joyful sensation\" at the\r\nvote, and calling for \"immovable perseverance,\" otherwise \"incalculable\r\nmischief.\"[452]\r\n\r\nNothing further now remained but the great solemnity for promulging\r\nthe Decree, and gathering the fruits of nearly eight months' toil.\r\nOnly five days' delay was taken--days of intense excitement, and\r\nof incidents striking at the time, and important for all time. The\r\nminority saw how their hopes that the Pope would recoil before a vote\r\nso solemn as that recorded had been vain. The war-horse was prancing\r\noutside the door of the Council, and the fighting sons of Loyola\r\ncould already tell what tidings he would bring. Louis Napoleon might\r\nhave doubts, but the Fathers of the _Civiltá_ had none. \"Everything\r\nis always directed and turned by Providence for the good and the\r\ntriumph of the Church.\" (VII. xi. 379). The crisis, they knew, would\r\ngive the Vicar of God an opportunity of intervening, with his newly\r\ncertified authority and infallibility, as mediator. This office once\r\naccepted would easily be turned to that of supreme judge. So would\r\nhis new reign be grandly commenced. The _Monde_, of Paris, said to\r\nbe the organ of the Nuncio, already called the war a religious war\r\nagainst Protestantism. France had been assured in every form that she\r\nhad only to attack Prussia, and all the Catholics of Southern Germany\r\nwould join her. Without the miscalculation at the Tuileries caused by\r\nthese statements, it is not probable that the French would have been\r\nhurled into the ditch of Sedan. Both the precepts and the prophecies\r\nof the reconstructionists failed. The cry, \"The Church,\" raised by the\r\nBavarian priests was not so strong as that of \"The Fatherland,\" raised\r\nby the patriots. This fact was still unknown at the Vatican. Though the\r\ninflation manifest before the Council was somewhat reduced, too much\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nThe prospect was not so bright to the bishops. They had not been always\r\ncooped up within the walls of Rome. Hints of how thoughts were turning\r\nreached them from home. They knew that men of study and of wisdom were\r\neither hostile to the new Constitution, or painfully solicitous. Some\r\nof the bishops had deep personal convictions, which experience during\r\nthe Council had intensified; convictions that the whole proceeding was\r\nneither more nor less than the adoption of a false doctrine to sanction\r\na fatal policy, and that the error was so fundamental as to involve the\r\nacceptance of a purely human fountain of doctrine for all time to come.\r\nThey met and debated whether they should vote in the open session. Only\r\ntwenty, according to Archbishop Scherr, were in favour of this course,\r\nand these did not insist on their own views, lest they should divide\r\nthe eighty-eight.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of July 15, about eight o'clock, a deputation entered\r\nthe Vatican, composed of the Primates of France and Hungary, with the\r\nArchbishops of Paris and Munich, and the Bishops of Mainz and Dijon.\r\nThey had to wait an hour--a time doubtless filled up with meditations\r\nmore ecclesiastical than those which sometimes occupy the moments lost\r\nin the ante-rooms of the Vatican; rooms full of traditional tales of\r\nthe pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and the sinful lusts of\r\nthe flesh; such tales as good men, who had been forced to hear them,\r\nwould not easily be forced to repeat.[453]\r\n\r\nThey were admitted about nine o'clock. They came from the minority to\r\nurge that the Pope should withdraw the additions made to the third\r\ncanon of the third chapter, that canon the attempt to snatch an\r\nunconscious vote upon which had caused so profound an impression. They\r\nalso wished the addition of a limiting clause to the definition of\r\ninfallibility in the fourth chapter. Quirinus seems afraid to report\r\nthe answer given by the Pope, and that for a reason which we suspect\r\nhas often prevented English correspondents writing in Italy from\r\ntelling true tales. They know that we judge of Popes and Cardinals by\r\nsome such standard as that of our own public men, and that therefore\r\nto us the true tale would look like an invention. In the present case\r\nthe answer was, \"I shall do all I can, my dear sons; but I have not yet\r\nread the proposed Decree, and I do not know what it contains.\"[454] His\r\nHoliness requested to have the petition in writing. The spokesman,\r\nDarboy, replied, with French tact, that he would have it sent to His\r\nHoliness, and would take the liberty of forwarding at the same time\r\nthe proposed Decree, which the Commission and the Presiding Cardinals\r\nhad omitted to lay before his Holiness, though it wanted only two\r\ndays of the public session, and thus had exposed him to the danger of\r\npromulging a Decree of which he was ignorant. Darboy not only did this,\r\nbut also took care that others should know what the Pope had actually\r\nsaid. He wrote to the Committee on Faith, strongly censuring them for\r\ntheir neglect in not laying the proposed Decrees before the Pontiff!\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe how all the Liberal Catholic writers who had\r\ncome to Rome began by speaking of the Pope with the deference usual on\r\nthis side of the Alps, but finally slipped into the habit of calling\r\nhim \"Pius.\" They evidently often had difficulty between their sense of\r\nthe conventional respect due to a personage whom so many own as their\r\nhead, and their feelings as honest men. The latter would have often\r\nprompted them to speak of Pius IX as Italians do, and not as Englishmen\r\nor Germans are wont to do.[455]\r\n\r\n\"Pius,\" continues Quirinus, added that if they would increase their\r\neighty-eight votes to a hundred he would see what could be done.\r\nOnly those who know the opinions entertained by that writer of the\r\nPope's personal ignorance, and of his habit of speaking as if he knew\r\neverything, can appreciate the statement that his Holiness concluded by\r\nassuring the deputation that it was notorious that the whole Church had\r\nalways taught the unconditional infallibility of the Popes.\r\n\r\nBishop Ketteler now threw himself on his knees before the Pontiff. For\r\nsome time he remained in that position, entreating his sovereign to\r\nmake some concession, and thus to restore peace and unity to the Church\r\nand to the Episcopate. This was the very scene to please one like Pius\r\nIX. And so the deputation left him with some hopes of concession--\"full\r\nof the best hopes,\" said the Archbishop of Munich.[456]\r\n\r\nTwo men speedily sought to undo any impression that might have been\r\nmade. Many a Roman Catholic has, in imagination, hovered over that\r\nscene, returning again and again to watch the figures of the agents\r\nof the Committee on Faith as they glided into the presence-chamber.\r\nSuch Catholics in their imaginings have scowled at, ay, have cursed\r\nSenestrey the pupil of the Jesuit College _Germanicum_, and Manning\r\nthe pupil of Oxford, as the instruments of the Jesuits going at this\r\nmoment to harden the heart of the Pontiff, which some hoped had begun\r\nto relent. It is said that this remarkable pair urged that all was now\r\nripe, that the majority were enthusiastic, and that moreover if the\r\nPontiff made concessions he would be dishonoured in history as a second\r\nHonorius.[457] This \"frightened the Pope,\" said Archbishop Von Scherr.\r\n\r\nThe hopes brought back by the deputation to the minority were speedily\r\ndispelled. In the course of the morning Cardinal Rauscher waited on\r\nhis Holiness to thank him in the name of the minority for the gracious\r\nreception of their deputation. The shrewd Austrian pointed out to\r\nhis royal master the effects which would flow from the definition as\r\nframed by the majority. \"It is too late,\" said the Pope; \"the formula\r\nis already distributed to the bishops and has been discussed. Besides,\r\nthe public session is convened. It is now impossible to yield to the\r\nwishes of the minority.\"[458] On Friday night the Pope said that he\r\nhad not seen the formula; on Saturday morning the Pope said that the\r\nformula was already distributed and discussed. And this formula was\r\nunchangeably to determine the fountain of doctrine, of ministerial\r\nauthority, and of all power in a so-called Church. Friedrich, on\r\nwriting down these words from the lips of his Archbishop, adds in a\r\nparenthesis, \"One is ready to go crazed at the measureless frivolity\r\nwith which the holiest questions are handled in Rome.\"\r\n\r\nThat same morning a Congregation was held to consider the suggestions\r\nmade by those who had given conditional votes. Two Spaniards, according\r\nto Quirinus (p. 804), had made two propositions tending to complete\r\nthe repudiation of the collective authority of the universal Church\r\nby the Bishop of Rome. The proposed Decree, as it stood, limited his\r\ndefinitions to \"matters which the Holy See had held from ancient times\r\nin common with other Churches.\"[459]\r\n\r\nThis language, however vaguely, did recognize both antiquity and\r\ncatholicity. The worthy Spaniard doubtless felt that the Vicar of God\r\nought not to be limited by any such things; that he should be left free\r\nto define what he felt called to define. The committee had been of\r\nthe same mind, and had adopted the proposal of the Spaniard that the\r\nabove-quoted clause should be struck out. The Sub-Secretary cried, \"The\r\namendment proposed to 76 is accepted by the committee: those who are in\r\nfavour of accepting it, stand up.\" Nearly all stood up. Ten or twelve\r\nstood up against it, and away went the antiquity and catholicity as\r\nexpeditiously as any Cardinal could desire.[460]\r\n\r\nThe inner lights of the Pontiff were thus freed from any restraint\r\narising out of ancient views, and the local creed of Rome was freed\r\nfrom any restraint arising out of a common Christianity as between that\r\ncity and other Churches.\r\n\r\nNow, however, came to pass a marvel, if anything could be marvellous\r\nthere and then. The venerable men seated all around had spent\r\ntheir long lives in hearing and telling of one thing--the glory,\r\nthe authority, the divinity of the Church, and the overwhelming\r\nconclusiveness of her consent. All who did not hear the Church were,\r\naccording to them, lost. Even when, in preparing the way for the change\r\nof base which they had foreseen before leaving home, some of them had\r\nappeared to throw tradition altogether overboard, it was only in order\r\nto substitute for it the general consent of the Church. Which of us\r\nwould have dared to tell devout Roman Catholics that their own bishops,\r\nwhen once in Rome under the terror of the Pontiff and the Jesuits,\r\nwould disavow the consent of the Catholic Church, and say that without\r\nit the word of a single man was quite as good? They may now attempt to\r\nexplain the words \"not by consent of the Church,\" as meaning something\r\nsmall; or even to say that Popes ever and always formally disclaimed\r\nthe necessity of her consent. The world must leave them to do so; but\r\nthey know, as well as we do, that had we said that their bishops would\r\nof a sudden put words like these into the creed, they would have called\r\nus calumniators. Yet what came to pass?\r\n\r\nThat came to pass which had often been hinted as necessary by the\r\nzealots during the Council, but had always been looked upon as\r\nimpossible by most men of the minority, although a few had openly said\r\nthat in such a Council nothing was impossible. Another Spaniard, when\r\nhe gave his conditional vote, had proposed that the words of the Decree\r\nwhich said, \"The definitions of the Roman Pontiff are of themselves\r\nirreformable,\" should be amended so as to read, \"The definitions of the\r\nRoman Pontiff are of themselves, _and not by consent of the Church_,\r\nirreformable.\" Vitelleschi says that no information was given as to the\r\nauthority at whose suggestion these metamorphic words were approved by\r\nthe committee, but approved by the committee they were. So, without\r\nany opportunity of debate, the Under Secretary cried, \"The amendment\r\nunder number 152, having been modified, is accepted by the committee\";\r\nand reading it, he added, \"Let those who are in favour of accepting\r\nit stand up.\" The great majority stood up. \"Let those who are against\r\naccepting it stand up.\" \"About thirty\" stood up.[461] Thus were those\r\nancient men called upon in their episcopal robes to extinguish the\r\nlight of that lamp to which they had ministered oil all the days of\r\ntheir lives. They obeyed like soldiers, and the old, old light of a\r\ncatholic consent was quenched for ever. Many of the eighty-eight were\r\nabsent, and knew not of this new, swift, and crowning victory of the\r\nguild over the hierarchy.\r\n\r\nDone in a moment! the Romish bishops had effaced from their law, and\r\nfrom their rule of faith, the consent of the Catholic Church! Talk\r\nof revolutions, of hasty parliamentary votes, of the sudden impulse\r\nof a mob; but where in history is there an instance of breaking with\r\na long and loud resounding past, in such haste, and so irrevocably;\r\nirrevocably, not by the ordinary law which entails the consequences\r\nof an act upon the future, but irrevocably by the form and intent of\r\nthe action itself? We know, alas! what these bishops are capable of\r\nrepresenting; but it is for the unborn to judge the men who did that\r\nact and then faced round, saying that they changed nothing. And these\r\nmen are to teach the human species the art of conserving all that\r\nthey have \"inherited and proved\"! The Church of the Popes had long\r\nceased, in the eye of Protestants, to have a claim to catholicity.\r\nNow, however, in the eye of Liberal Catholics she explicitly rejected\r\ncatholicity by statutory and irreformable law. They saw her contract\r\nherself to the sect of one man and his retainers, to a religion made up\r\nof faith in one man, his inner light, and his _faits accomplis_.\r\n\r\nThe slow but irresistible operation of principles had at last worked\r\nout its ultimate issue. Liberal Catholics were the first to see that\r\nthe religion of the Pope had now really ceased to be Catholic, or\r\neven national, or indeed municipal--that it had in fact become only\r\npalatial. They at once named it the religion of the Vatican. They\r\ndid not so soon admit that the principle of one city church--not\r\nthe mother, and not a model--being the mistress of all others, and\r\npractically the fountain of their faith, contained in itself the germ\r\nof all that had now come to fruit.\r\n\r\nThe sitting which began with deeds so very solemn ended in another\r\nway. For once the poor Pope had been exposed to the plague of\r\npamphlets in the Holy City. It is pathetic to read the wailing over\r\nthe destiny that subjected so holy a being to this in addition to\r\nhis other \"martyrdoms,\" \"Calvaries,\" \"crucifixions,\" and such like\r\nwords, to win a tear. Many of the vexatious writings were in Latin.\r\nThus if they had the additional bitterness of being the work often\r\nof bishops, always of priests, they still had the veil of a dead\r\nlanguage. Not a few, however, had been written in living tongues.\r\nTwo of the latter, which cut dreadfully deep, were in French--_What\r\nis going on in the Council?_ and _The Last Hour of the Council_. We\r\nare now to see how these are dealt with. It is announced by the First\r\nPresident that a certain protest will be distributed. So papers are\r\nhanded round. During this process the Under-Secretary calls out, Let\r\nthe Fathers take notice that the sitting is not over! Then from the\r\npulpit, in the name of the Presidents, he reads a protest against\r\nfalse reports in general, and the two pamphlets in particular. They\r\nwere stinking calumnies and shameful lies--_putidissimæ calumniæ ...\r\nprobosa mendacia_. The Italians and Spaniards, who could not have\r\nread them, cried, \"We condemn them.\" The minority cried, \"We do not\r\ncondemn them.\" The President called upon those who did condemn them\r\nto stand up. Sambin says that so few remained seated that, to avoid\r\nexposing them to humiliation, the contrary was not put. Among these\r\nmen Friedrich names Rauscher and Schwarzenberg. Two copies of the\r\ncondemnation had been handed to every one of the bishops. The President\r\nnow read a request that each would return one of them signed with his\r\nown name. This trap, however, was not successful. Haynald said that\r\nif the Presidents would translate _La Dernière Heure_ into Latin, he\r\nand the rest of the Hungarians would be able to see if it was as bad as\r\ntheir Eminences had said it was.[462] The _Acta Sanctæ Sedis_ make no\r\nmention of any demur, but notes that many prelates said, \"Willingly,\r\nwith all my heart, yes, even to blood!\" But why giving bad names to two\r\npamphleteers should call forth such heroic resolutions is not obvious.\r\nThus did an OEcumenical Council spend its last legislative moment in\r\nrecording a condemnation of two pamphlets which obviously the bulk of\r\nthose who gave sentence could not have read. The presentation to every\r\nman personally of the two papers, and the call to sign, coming from\r\nthe chair, was a symptom not calculated to dissipate certain fears\r\nthat had got abroad among the minority. It was reported that if they\r\ndared to give an adverse vote in the public session, two papers would\r\nbe immediately presented to them, the one being a subscription to the\r\ndogma, the other being the resignation of their sees. If they did not\r\nsign the first, they must sign the second. They knew that in case they\r\nrefused to sign both, they were within the walls of Rome. And suppose a\r\nbishop to have signed his resignation and then to find himself in the\r\nhands of the Papal police! And men liable even to the suspicion of such\r\nmenaces were free \"judges and legislators!\"\r\n\r\nSo ended the last of the General Congregations, being the eighty-sixth\r\nsince the beginning. It will be ever memorable--a monument of despatch\r\nand versatility. It renounced, as lights in doctrine, antiquity,\r\ncatholicity, and the consent of the Church, and it denounced two French\r\npamphlets, and gave to _Ce Qui se Passe au Concile_ and _La Dernière\r\nHeure du Concile_ an immortality in the formal Acts of that assembly\r\ndenied to all the petitions, suggestions, deliberations, and votes of\r\nthe whole hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church in their fourscore and\r\nsix anxious and pregnant sittings in General Congregation.\r\n\r\nFor awhile the protest against these pamphlets, of which the wording\r\nis named by Vitelleschi as a sample of the violent language common in\r\nthe Roman _bureaux_ at the time, is actually printed among the Acts of\r\nthe Council, those Acts contain not a word of the votes, proposals,\r\nor discussions of the General Congregations; not a hint of all the\r\nprotests put in by the minority, not a hint of the voting in the great\r\nCongregation on July 13, or, in fact, of anything that could give a\r\nknowledge of the processes, or of any other results than the lists of\r\ncommittees and the formulated Decrees. By processes we do not mean the\r\nceremonial ones, for they are briefly described, but the legislative\r\nand deliberative ones, which are entirely omitted. The Bulls of the\r\nPope and the Decrees of the Presidents as to procedure are printed; but\r\nno action of the bishops. When what has passed through the hands of the\r\nbishops becomes a Papal constitution, it of course appears. As to the\r\nhistorians, they indeed do give the voting on July 13; but we believe\r\nthat not one of those who wrote by or under authority gives one of the\r\ndocuments of the protesting bishops, from the beginning of the Council\r\nto the end, or any indication of where they may be found. Vitelleschi\r\ntells how, on this same day, Cardinal Rauscher himself made a last\r\ndesperate effort to impress the immovable Pope, and was received with\r\nscant courtesy.\r\n\r\nThat Saturday night a number of downcast old men, each with more or\r\nless of a retinue, took leave of Rome. Some went by the desolate way\r\nto Civitá Vecchia. On reaching that city, and beginning to breathe the\r\nfree air of the sea, they might well wonder how long the red, white,\r\nand blue flag would warn away the red, white, and green; how long the\r\neldest daughter of the Church would help the autocrat to impose his\r\nobscure tyranny on this threadbare patch of land,--a land whereof the\r\nnatural lot was neither poverty nor dependence upon the foreigner.\r\nSome of them took the less desolate way towards the North. In the\r\nclear July night they passed by Monte Rotondo, with Mentana not far\r\noff. When would Garibaldi be heard of anew? Or would the next dash at\r\nRome be left to Garibaldi? Spoleto, Terni, and other places lost in\r\n1860, would suggest the question: Will Ireland and Belgium find men for\r\nnew crusades, and if so, will they be more successful? The lamps of\r\nPerugia, high on the hill, would recall tales of slaughter under Pius\r\nIX. Perhaps the prelates had not heard them, or had said that they were\r\nall lies. All of the Frenchman, or of the German, in their hearts would\r\nbe drawn in one direction; all of the Papist in another. The Frenchman\r\nwould naturally say, He who has repaid the restoration of twenty years\r\nago, and the support given since then, by deliberate insult of the\r\ngreatest names of the Gallican dead, by coarse offences against every\r\nman of mark among the French living that dared to speak a dissentient\r\nword, and by the ostentatious abrogation of all the Gallican liberties,\r\ndeserves not that the flag of France should longer shelter his policy.\r\nThe German would naturally say, The attempt to undo the unity of\r\nthe Fatherland, and once more to expose us through division to the\r\nincursions, the burnings, and the plunderings of the French, is no\r\nless than diabolical; and he that aims at breaking up Germany for the\r\nsake of weakening Italy, should be left to his deserts. But in such\r\nmen, after all, the Frenchman or the German represented but the human\r\ninstincts, not the drilled, trained thoughts, and the unchangeably\r\nmoulded habits. The German, or the Frenchman, represented the boy, but\r\nthe Papist represented the man. \"The weakening of the individual will\r\nin the priest,\" of which Vitelleschi speaks, as one of the secrets\r\nof that mysterious zeal to-day for things which were esteemed untrue\r\nyesterday, is scarcely more striking than is the weakening of national\r\nsympathy, except when the interests of the Papacy are supposed to be\r\nconnected with those of the nation.\r\n\r\nWe may close this chapter with one specimen more of the practical\r\npreaching for the establishment of the new moral order, of the real\r\nChristian civilization, which the scribes of the Court had kept under\r\nthe eyes of all who sought, in their pages, for tidings of the great\r\nthings which the Council was doing. Our last specimen was that of an\r\nEnglish youth: this is that of a French one. Bravely fighting his gun\r\nat Monte Rotondo, fell young Bernard Quatrebarbes, the son of a Breton\r\nmarquis, mortally wounded. When the victors of Mentana delivered the\r\nprisoners, no less than four cousins gathered around the pallet of the\r\nwounded Bernard. At Rome he was joined by his father, his sister, and\r\nother female relations. The day after his arrival in the city, his\r\nhumble room in the hospital having been entered by Pius IX, \"radiant\r\nwith sovereign sweetness,\" as the writer expresses it, Bernard was\r\nnaturally in ecstasy at such an august apparition. The Pope desiring\r\nto see the wound of his crusader, and making the sign of the cross\r\nover it, said, \"God will bless thee, my friend, as I bless thee.\" The\r\nMarquis announced to his wife the departure of her boy in three words,\r\n\"Bernard in Paradise.\" \"Words,\" exclaims the author, unconsciously\r\nsignalizing the fall of Rome from Christian hope--\"Words worthy of the\r\nprimitive Christians.\" Ay, but, thank God, primitive Christians before\r\nsaying over their dead \"in Paradise\" instead of \"in Purgatory,\" did\r\nnot wait till one fell fighting for the royalty of a bishop! Over the\r\nfisher drowned with his nets, over the mother who died in childbirth,\r\nthey rejoiced with the joy of hope eternal. It was for later, darker\r\nages to drag them back again into a dim region where a crowd of\r\nintervening patrons and all manner of priestly spells came between them\r\nand the bosom of a Father, between them and the home where all the\r\nbrothers meet.\r\n\r\nMaria Sophia, ex-Queen of Naples, came so often to the bedside of the\r\ndying Bernard, that our narrator says she almost seemed to have taken\r\nup her abode in the hospital, and sometimes she was moved to tears. By\r\nthat bedside also did her husband say to the Marquis, \"How noble is\r\nyour son!\" To the Marquis also wrote another expectant exile, the Count\r\nof Chambord, saying that he admired \"the short but bright career of\r\nBernard, and his marvellous end.\" It was the Colonel of Bernard that\r\ntold the father of his departure, and in these words: \"I have another\r\npatron in heaven.\" But above all when the news was conveyed to the\r\nPope, he said: \"Bernard Quatrebarbes is a saint in heaven.\" At home in\r\nBrittany, while the corpse lay in the chapel of the château, the people\r\nflocked around the bier; but it was \"more to invoke the departed than\r\nto pray for him.\" The new Hermit who preaches the new crusade thus\r\nconcludes his memoir:--\r\n\r\n    The death of Bernard Quatrebarbes, who sacrificed to God youth,\r\n    fortune, and pleasure, a tranquil life and the joys of home,\r\n    in order to march in the defence of the truth, of virtue,\r\n    of the Church, will awaken the drowsy soul of more than one\r\n    young cavalier. Bernard is already a martyr, and he will be an\r\n    apostle.[463]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 442: _Friedberg_, 145; _Quirinus_, 788.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 443: See Protest with signatures. _Doc._, ii. 400-403.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 444: _Apologia_, p. 327.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 445: _Quirinus_, p. 792.

Veuillot--Final Deputation and Protest.\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday, July 17, was rather more of a fast than of a feast for M.\r\nVeuillot. He says, \"War and oppositions are cruel clouds.\" Bad as\r\nwere the rumours of war, those of \"rebellion\" among the bishops were\r\nstill worse. It had evidently become known that the minority were not\r\nto be cowed into gracing the public solemnity with their compulsory\r\n_Placet_. It was even rumoured that the bishops would go into the\r\nopen session and disturb the solemnity by saying _Non placet_--ay,\r\nM. Veuillot had heard, by shouting it and outrageously repeating it\r\nin the face of the Pope.[464] While nothing was more desirable than\r\nthat, to prove the freedom of the Council, two or three should say\r\n_Non placet_, any serious number doing so would be detestable. The\r\nrefusal of the non-contents to vote at all would be only one degree\r\nless bad. M. Veuillot, however, discovered that many whose departure,\r\n\"or rather desertion,\" had been reported were still really in Rome.\r\nBut, on the other hand, he saw carriages at the doors of leaders of the\r\n\"tormenting and tormented\" Opposition; at those of the Archbishops of\r\nParis and Lyons, and of Cardinals Rauscher and Matthieu. Even the Via\r\nFrattina was visited to note the symptoms at the door of Maret. After\r\nnight-fall, Veuillot cries, \"Many are gone, and many more are going in\r\nthe morning. They will really absent themselves. I cannot help thinking\r\nof a caricature. It represented some seditious fellows in a scare, who\r\nsaid, 'Now is the moment to show ourselves; let us hide!'\"\r\n\r\nAs the noontide of that July Sunday blazed upon the Vatican, a\r\ndeputation had entered the presence chamber, headed by Darboy and\r\nSimor, Primate of Hungary. They came to make one last attempt to\r\nprocure the prorogation of the Council without the promulgation of\r\nthe dogma. Their only answer was the old _Non possumus_. Then the\r\nlast of the luckless series of protests was solemnly delivered. They\r\nhad not heart enough to fight, and had too much conscience to submit.\r\nSo they took the middle course, and spoiled for ever the pretext of\r\nmoral unanimity except the dead unanimity of form. Their fears, or\r\ntheir views of unity and reverence would not allow them in public to\r\nwithstand the Pope. He had justly calculated the effect upon them of\r\nthrone and tiara, with the fear of possible degradation. They had not,\r\nperhaps, sufficiently calculated what might have been the effect on him\r\nof honest men standing up one after another in their appointed place,\r\nand saying before all the Churches, as a wiser than they had done of\r\na better than he, that he was to be blamed. They would have exposed,\r\nit is true, Pope Pius IX to a temporary check, yet they might have\r\nsaved the Papacy from an irrevocable error. But in proportion as the\r\nPapacy had become weak in producing conviction, it had concentrated\r\nits strength on the means of producing submission. Its success in\r\nthat art was now to be its own punishment. No Protestant had expected\r\nany effectual resistance from men trained as Romish bishops. Any real\r\ntenacity of conscience shown during the Council, was due to nobler\r\ninfluences spread abroad in countries where the ascendancy of Rome is\r\nnot complete. There is, to our mode of thinking, something not merely\r\nincongruous and grotesque, but a great deal worse, in putting forward\r\nthe paltry plea of personal offence, or personal consideration, when\r\nthe matter in hand is a dogma that is to mould the religion of millions\r\nfor ever. The fact that these prelates do put forward such a notion\r\ncountenances the statements often made about men giving as the reason\r\nfor their votes that they could not refuse the Holy Father or hurt\r\nhis feelings. Vitelleschi thinks that the fear of being required to\r\nresign their Sees or subscribe the dogma was one of the elements in\r\ndetermining the minority to leave Rome before the definition (p. 212).\r\nIf so, seeing them escape from that dilemma would be one of the causes\r\nof the mortification shown by the majority, as expressed by Veuillot.\r\nWe give the last of the protests in full[465]:--\r\n\r\n    Most Blessed Father, in the Congregation held on the 13th of this\r\n    month we gave our votes upon the proposed Decree of the first\r\n    dogmatic constitution of the Church of Christ.\r\n\r\n    It is known to your Holiness that there were eighty-eight Fathers,\r\n    who, pressed by conscience and moved by love of the Holy Church,\r\n    gave their votes in the words _Non placet_, that sixty-two others\r\n    voted in the words _Placet juxta modum_, and that, moreover, about\r\n    seventy were absent from the Council and abstained from voting. To\r\n    these are to be added a number who, from infirmity or other serious\r\n    reasons, have returned to their dioceses.\r\n\r\n    In this manner, our votes have been made known to your Holiness\r\n    and to the whole world, and it has been made evident by how many\r\n    bishops our opinion is approved; and thus have we discharged our\r\n    office and duty.\r\n\r\n    From the time above stated, nothing has occurred to change our\r\n    judgment; but, on the contrary, several things have been added,\r\n    and those exceedingly serious, which have strengthened us in our\r\n    purpose.\r\n\r\n    Confirming, then, by this document our votes, we have determined to\r\n    abstain from the public session to be held on the 18th. That filial\r\n    piety and reverence, which lately brought our deputies to the feet\r\n    of your Holiness do not permit us openly, and in the Father's face,\r\n    to say _Non placet_ in a case so closely concerning the person of\r\n    your Holiness.\r\n\r\n    And, indeed, the votes that would be given in the public session\r\n    could only repeat those already given in the Congregation.\r\n\r\n    We, therefore, return to our flocks without delay, for after so\r\n    long an absence we are much needed on account of the rumours\r\n    of war, and especially on account of the great spiritual\r\n    necessities. We return grieving that, because of the sad juncture\r\n    of circumstances, even peace and tranquillity of conscience is\r\n    disturbed among the faithful.\r\n\r\n    Meanwhile, commending with all our hearts the Church of God, and\r\n    your Holiness, to the grace and protection of our Lord Jesus\r\n    Christ, we are of your Holiness the most devoted and most obedient\r\n    sons.\r\n\r\nLeaving, then, in the hands of the Pope this solemn confirmation of a\r\nbelief registered by a formidable array of bishops, that he ought not\r\nto be proclaimed as the infallible representative of God, they turned\r\ntheir backs on the palace which had witnessed their many humiliations.\r\nTheir allusion to the things which had been added since the 13th as\r\nbeing \"exceedingly serious,\" is another of the many witnesses out of\r\ntheir own mouths against their subsequent statements. Their clear\r\nstatement that did they vote in the session it could only be to repeat\r\ntheir former vote, seals with the seal of deliberate misrepresentation\r\nmany solemn assertions since that day made under mitres.\r\n\r\nIt was a grief to the soul of M. Veuillot to learn that the Ambassador\r\nof France had graced with his presence the departure of Darboy. De\r\nBanneville had accompanied the Archbishop to the station, escorted by\r\nMérode, with Monsignor Vecchiotti, and Father Trullet. The recalcitrant\r\nArchbishop was even placed in \"a kind of carriage of honour\"; a fact\r\nwhich reminded the Argus of the _Univers_ that a certain bishop had\r\nsaid, We go away conquerors, but we leave some wounded on the field.\r\n\"This fine carriage seemed to me an ambulance.\"[466] Thus, poor Darboy\r\ntook his way towards the storm-cloud, blackening behind the hills, in\r\nthe after clap of which he alone of all the host was to find a bloody\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nThe Monday morning dawned heavily over Rome. As the eyes of the last\r\nportion of the fleeing minority were sadly tracing the outlines of\r\nthe hills on the upper course of the Tiber, while those of the first\r\nportion were tracing the forms of the outlying Alps and a few were\r\nwatching morn as it spread over the waves of the Mediterranean, a\r\nPope for the first time rose in Rome with the consciousness that ere\r\nsunset he would be infallible, not only in fact, but also in law.\r\nHis less happy prececessors had claimed that crown, but never had\r\nreceived it. Now he was about, with the consent of the Church, to put\r\non the power to be infallible for ever, \"without the consent of the\r\nChurch.\" Had ever diplomacy won such a victory? had ever an oligarchy\r\nso completely signed itself away? Tell him that the temporal power was\r\nof no spiritual value! But could all that have been accomplished except\r\nwithin the walls of a strong city? As Pius IX looked from the Papal\r\napartments across the Tiber, the Pincian was gloomy, and the Sabine\r\nHills were hid in clouds under a threatening sun. But he would remember\r\nthe day of his taking possession, and how gloom had turned to rainbow;\r\nthe day of the return from Gaeta, and how the sun had opened from the\r\nwest at the right moment; above all, the day of \"The Immaculate,\" and\r\nhow the sun had seemed glad of the sight. True, the dutiful luminary\r\nhad failed on the opening day of the Council, but the Jesuit Fathers\r\nhad written that the solemnity would be brilliant at its close, and\r\nthat the city would blaze with triumph, as Ephesus had done in the\r\nyear 431. And was not the throne so placed in the Council Hall, that,\r\nall being propitious, the beams would fall as they had done on the day\r\nof the Immaculate; and surely the Virgin would not fail to send them.\r\nAt all events, it was certain that he would lie down that night not\r\nonly the Pope of the Immaculate, but the Pope of the Infallible--the\r\nfirst human being in the records of the world to whom a number of the\r\ncreatures of God had deliberately given the right of telling to them\r\nand to their succeeding generations what they were to believe for ever\r\nand ever. The deifying of an emperor, either in the plains of Babylon\r\nor in the temples of Rome, was a little thing as compared with the\r\napotheosis now about to be performed. The dogmas of the emperor were\r\nnot to be eternal on earth, though he might cause himself to be decreed\r\nimmortal in heaven. The word \"apotheosis\" was perfectly natural to the\r\npen of Vitelleschi, or of any other Liberal Catholic who dared to speak\r\nwhat he thought. But it is nevertheless true that deification among\r\nthe heathen, whether ancient or modern, involved little exaltation\r\ncompared with that now to be given to the Bishop of Rome. A Theseus or\r\na Rama, an Antinous or an Augustus, had a lowly part in ruling eternal\r\ndestinies compared with that to be now assigned to the Count and Priest\r\nMastai-Ferretti.\r\n\r\nThe monasteries and nunneries sent forth a contingent, as on the\r\nopening day; but where were the proud vehicles and the pressing\r\nthrongs? Vitelleschi says that two or three houses in the city were\r\ndecorated. How dead was the indifference denoted by such language on an\r\noccasion absolutely unprecedented, cannot be conveyed to the minds of\r\nthose who do not know what the people of a southern city can do when\r\nthey really mean to decorate. As the places for spectators in the Hall\r\nfilled up, it was whispered from one to another, \"No crowned heads.\" An\r\nInfanta of Portugal was the lone flower of royalty\r\n\r\n   \"Where once a garden smiled.\"\r\n\r\nEven ambassadors failed. France, the eldest daughter, was not there.\r\nSpain, the Catholic, was not there. Portugal, the faithful, was not\r\nthere. Austria, the apostolic, was not there. Bavaria was not there.\r\nPoland was dead. Italy was alive again, but her heart and hope were\r\nelsewhere. Belgium and Holland had each sent a consul, the one to\r\nwelcome infallibility, with its constitution condemned by the Church,\r\nthe other with its heresy. Vitelleschi mentions a representative of the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco. The _Giornale di Roma_ is not so worldly minded\r\nas to specify any state, but says that members of the diplomatic corps\r\nwere present.[467]\r\n\r\nAbout nine o'clock the Cardinals, Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops,\r\nAbbots, and Generals, all in red, began to stream in. Five hundred and\r\nthirty-five seats were soon occupied. It thus appeared that there were\r\nsome two hundred less than at the opening. About twenty had died.[468]\r\nSeveral were ill. Some, in Rome, were absent from disclination to\r\nattend.[469] Of the minority only two now changed sides. Of these,\r\none was a demonstrative Oppositionist--Landriot, of Rheims.\r\nThis conspicuous absence of the minority was a disappointment and a\r\nhumiliation, though it was nothing more. Even the _Acta Sanctæ Sedis_\r\nsays that its effect was traceable on the countenances of the Fathers.\r\nThey grieved for the obstinacy of their brethren. Indeed, in the\r\nCongregation where the vote was taken, some, with clasped hands, had\r\nimplored their friends to give up their false opinion at last. Still\r\nthe conqueror had his triumph, though he had not the satisfaction\r\nof seeing the captives follow in his train. It was Cæsar without\r\nVercingetorix. It would have been a proud moment for the resident\r\nCardinals had Rauscher and Schwarzenberg made Vienna and Prague bow\r\ndown to Rome. Had the sturdy Darboy done homage for Paris, it would\r\nhave been a sign to the Curia that the new world of the Jesuit seers\r\nwas at last actually above the horizon. The readers of M. Veuillot\r\ncan well imagine into what ecstasies he would have fallen, and with\r\nwhat dithyrambs his pages would have detonated, had his ears been\r\npermitted to hear Dupanloup pronounce his _Placet_. This was not to\r\nbe. Those bishops were not the men to stand up in their places and\r\ncontend; yet were they not so thoroughly beaten as ostentatiously to\r\nsubmit. Their paper confirmation of their legislative vote came like\r\nan impertinent parley to tease the conquerors. What ought to have been\r\neither a combat or a _fête?_ was neither. It was a ceremonial of which\r\neven the _Civiltá_ quotes its description from the _Giornale di Roma_,\r\nwhile M. Veuillot himself is too much affected to write more than a few\r\nlines--as if silence was the vestment which his strong emotions were\r\nwont to put on. In his after touches he often speaks of the glory of\r\nthe dogma, but we do not remember that he ever alludes to the glory of\r\nthat day. The Protestant _Fromman_, whom we have not been accustomed to\r\nquote, though very glad to consult, called the ceremony tedious; but\r\nthat was unpardonable.\r\n\r\nThe Pope did not enter on this occasion, as on former ones,\r\nbetween Antonelli and Mertel, but between Grassellini and Mertel.\r\nHad Antonelli, because of having failed to give his vote in the\r\nCongregation, lost his wonted place on the day when the fruit was to be\r\nplucked? The hall and city, according to Vitelleschi, \"wore a cold and\r\nsevere aspect.\" December 8 seemed to have dropped its mantle on July\r\n18. Perhaps, however, ere the moment of promulgation arrived, the Roman\r\nazure would be in the ascendant, and hearts would be gladdened at the\r\nright time. Indeed, the _Acta Sanctæ Sedis_, in contradiction to all\r\nprofane authors, states that just before the Pope uttered his sentence\r\nthe gloom somewhat cleared up. It does not attempt to say that the sun\r\nshone.\r\n\r\nAfter the preparatory ceremonies, Fessler and Valenziani approached the\r\nthrone. The Secretary handed the constitution _Pastor Eternus_ to the\r\nPontiff, with its chapters and its canons making a new Church, if ever\r\na new constitution made a new corps, and making, as Pius IX hoped, the\r\ncommencement of a new era for the kingdoms of this world, all of which,\r\nwith the glory of them, had been by some one promised to him after\r\nthis day. That constitution professed to give to him, or rather to\r\nrecognize as inhering in him, authority over all territories on earth,\r\nand over all those actions of man that possessed any moral character.\r\nOver the entire sphere of human accountability henceforth and for\r\never it was for him to reign as should seem to him right. Valenziani\r\nascended the desk, and read out the title of the Decree. He then sat\r\ndown, and while the sky grew blacker, the house darker, and the hearts\r\nof men more heavy with an impression of something terrible, he read\r\nchapter after chapter, until at last he reached the close, and the\r\nhouse echoed back his cadence, with the word of the Pope's self-written\r\ndoom, _Irreformable_,--\"The definitions of the Roman Pontiff are of\r\nthemselves, and not by consent of the Church, _irreformable_.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a moment's pause came the sealing Canon, \"If any shall presume to\r\ncontradict this our definition, let him be anathema.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader ceased. The storm alone was speaking. For a moment no human\r\ntone disturbed the air. But memory was repeating two terrific words,\r\nand imagination kept saying that the winds were whispering.\r\n\r\nIrreformable! Anathema!\r\n\r\nValenziani rose, and sending his voice athwart the gloom, said,\r\n\"Most Reverend Fathers, are the Decrees and Canons contained in this\r\nConstitution agreed to?\"\r\n\r\nUpon this he left the desk, and Jacobini, the Sub-Secretary, ascending\r\nit, called out the name of Cardinal Mattei, who was absent from old\r\nage. He then called \"Constantine, Bishop of Porto\"; and Cardinal\r\nPatrizi, rising, and taking off his mitre, said, _Placet_. The voice\r\nnear the throne made the darkening hall to echo _Placet_, and the\r\nvoice near the door repeated the echo, _Placet_. Then the scrutineers\r\nrecorded the vote. Cardinal Amat was next called, and his _Placet_ and\r\nsome five or six others sounded harmoniously in the deepening gloom.\r\nJacobini then called Frederick Joseph, Archbishop of Prague. The\r\nprincely priest who from the age of thirty-three had worn the purple,\r\nand who was to represent the house of Schwarzenberg and the Church of\r\nBohemia,--that Church imposed by burnings and by blood,--responded not.\r\nThere was a moment's pause and a sense of a want. _Absent_, cried the\r\nvoice near the throne. _Absent_, replied the voice near the door; and\r\nthe influences from without were seconded by a damping influence from\r\nwithin. The next name was that of Cardinal Corsi, a man of repute for\r\npiety, who was well known to be averse to the definition. According to\r\nVitelleschi, he and the other dissentient Cardinals drew their scarlet\r\nhats over their eyes and remained silent. But they wore mitres, not\r\nhats. Of the rest, Quirinus asserts that, besides the Cardinal Vicar,\r\nPatrizi, only two put into their _Placet_ spirit enough to stand up,\r\nand they were Bonaparte and Panebianco. Fourth after Corsi came the\r\nname of the senior French Cardinal. \"James, Archbishop of Besançon,\"\r\ncried Jacobini; but Cardinal Mathieu did not respond. _Absent_, cried\r\nthe official voice. _Absent_, echoed the fellow official. Even France\r\nseemed failing. Thrice had the tranquillizing _Placet_ cheered the\r\nstill deepening shadows, when Jacobini came to the notable name of\r\n\"Joseph Othmar, Archbishop of Vienna.\" But Rauscher was far away, and\r\nonce more did the thunderous air thrill with the depressing sound,\r\n_Absent_. Now followed a successive roll of more than twelve _Placets_,\r\nand then came the name of Philip, Archbishop of Bologna. All watched\r\nCardinal Guidi, who pronounced a _Placet_. The Pope closely eyed him,\r\nand when the creature delivered his judgment before earth and heaven in\r\nfavour of the dogma which just one month previously he had, in the same\r\nplace, solemnly proposed to lay under an anathema, his royal master\r\nsaid, \"Poor man!\" or, as others report it, \"Good man!\" but Vitelleschi\r\nremarks that in Italian they might both mean the same thing. To Guidi\r\nsucceeded two staunch _Placets_, from Bonnechose and Cullen, but next\r\nwas called Gustavus of Santa Maria Traspontina. Eyes looked for another\r\nprince-priest who represented the house of Hohenlohe and the feelings\r\nof Bavaria, but there was no response. Hohenlohe, like Rauscher and\r\nSchwarzenberg, was _absent_.\r\n\r\nAfter the list of Cardinals was exhausted, the patriarchal Sees were\r\ncalled. Two Sees were especially connected with the tradition of Peter.\r\nAfter men of genuine Italian name, Antici-Mattei and Ballerini, had,\r\nfor Constantinople and for Alexandria, answered _Placet_, was called\r\nthe name of Antioch. Its Patriarch was named Jusseff, and the call\r\nevoked no response; so Antioch, the See of Peter, and _absent_, the\r\nsign of disapprobation, were set in men's minds together. Of course\r\nthe Roman Valerga said _Placet_ for Jerusalem. Then came the other\r\ncity connected with the life of Peter, and when Audu, whose secret\r\nexperience after his first audacity in venturing to differ from Pius\r\nIX was known to all, was called to answer for Babylon, all expected\r\nthat he would have been overcome like Guidi. But no. Oriental servility\r\ndid not equal Rome, and so the reply made for Babylon was _Absent_.\r\n_La Dernière Heure du Concile_ asserts that as Audu had been sent for\r\nby the Pope, so had Jusseff been sent for by the authorities of the\r\nPropaganda, \"to know by what right he dared to bear testimony to the\r\nbelief of the East without having previously submitted his speech to\r\nrevision\" (p. 4). Next came the primatial Sees. Where was the Primate\r\nof France? Where the Primate of Hungary? They, too, among the _absent_.\r\nAnd of the Archbishops, where were those of Paris, of Milan, and of\r\nMunich? Where the Nestor of the English-speaking group, John of Tuam?\r\nThese were painful deficiencies. Still, in numbers if not in influence\r\nthe roll of _Placets_ from among the Archbishops presented a very\r\nlarge majority. Among the bishops, the first name called was that of\r\nthe very aged Losanna, of Biella, one of the staunchest opponents. So\r\nthe first reply, though for an Italian bishop, was _Absent_. Then a\r\nflow of _Placets_, frequently chequered by an _Absent_. In all, says\r\nVitelleschi, nearly one hundred and fifty bishops were absent, many\r\nof them men who held the most illustrious Sees.[470] The _Acta Sanctæ\r\nSedis_ confesses to one hundred and twelve absentees from among those\r\ncalled; which number did not, of course, include men who had already\r\nobtained leave of absence. The number who were present was five\r\nhundred and thirty-five. In this whole list the uniform responses were\r\neither _Placet_ or _Absent_ till the name of the Bishop of Caizzo, a\r\nNeapolitan, was called. The official reported his vote as _Placet_.\r\nCaizzo raised his voice and loudly uttered _Non placet_. Then, again,\r\nto the end, _Placet_ followed _Placet_, alternating with the voice of\r\nthe rolling thunder. Finally was called Fitzgerald of little Rock in\r\nAmerica. Thinking that he alone of the Fallibilists was present, he\r\nhad begged not to be brought forward; but now that another bishop had\r\ngiven a negative vote he responded, _Non placet_.[471] This set tongues\r\nagoing. It was roundly asserted that the appearance of the Neapolitan\r\nand the American had been arranged for, in order to give an air of\r\nfreedom. Vitelleschi naturally thinks that it is needless to search so\r\nfar for motives. Yet, the _Civiltá_ makes a display of these two votes,\r\nsaying that without them it would have been alleged that the Fathers\r\nwere not free. It tells of a correspondent of some of the \"bad\" papers\r\nwho on hearing the first _Non placet_ was evidently annoyed, and being\r\nasked by a friend the cause of that annoyance said, \"This negative vote\r\nspoils all for us.\"[472] The _Civiltá_ quotes a description of how\r\nRiccio, the Neapolitan, after the definition, went down on his knees\r\nand said, _Credo_, I believe; and how Fitzgerald pressed his episcopal\r\ncross to his breast and said, \"Now I believe. Now do I also firmly\r\nbelieve.\"[473] When all the votes had been delivered, the scrutineers\r\nand notaries brought to the Secretary of the Council a statement of\r\nthe result. The Secretary, followed by the scrutineers and notaries,\r\nadvanced to the steps of the throne. There they all knelt down. The\r\nSecretary ascended the steps and read, \"Blessed Father, the Decrees and\r\nCanons are agreed to by all the Fathers, two excepted.\"\r\n\r\nAll this time the gloom was deep. \"The voice of the Lord\" again and\r\nagain pealed over the city. Thunderbolts more than once struck close to\r\nthe Cathedral. Some glass in the windows of the apse just behind the\r\nthrone was broken. Some, according to Jesuit writers, said, Providence\r\nis proclaiming the downfall of Gallicanism. Some, according to the\r\n_Acta Sanctæ Sedis_, said, The demon is disturbed, the storm shows\r\nthat this does not please him. This interpretation would seem to have\r\nbeen that of the learned editor, for he adds, \"The thunderbolts which\r\nJupiter of the Pagans forged did the city no harm.\" Many said, God is\r\ninstalling the new Moses upon the new Sinai. This, at least with those\r\nwho wrote, was evidently the prevailing interpretation.\r\n\r\nThe moment had come. Now was to be spoken the word so oft invoked in\r\napostrophe, apologue, and prayer,--the word for which many had pictured\r\na universe in chaos as waiting in blind but agonizing throes,--the word\r\nwhich so-called Christian journals and Christian ministers had, times\r\nunnumbered, described as the voice of God pronouncing the creative\r\nfiat, Let there be light. But where was the sun? According to many\r\npromises and to careful arrangements, he was at this moment to pour\r\ndown upon the Lawgiver while announcing to all people, nations, and\r\nlanguages, the new law that changeth not, a radiance which would be as\r\nif angels were unfolding their wings above him and around. But the sun\r\nwould not! The priest, in his conflict with chaos, was, at the supreme\r\nmoment, left to the light of his own beloved wax candles. That light\r\nwhich his taste tells him adorns the house of God in the eye of day,\r\nand teaches celestial truths to immortal men, became at last of real\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThe High Priest arose from his throne. All hearts stood still. He\r\nthought, and they thought, that he was about to proclaim himself\r\nunerring. But had not the wine been spirited away between the cup and\r\nthe lip? The faults incident to composing in a committee, and those\r\nincident to amending in a hurry, were both embedded in the Decree. All\r\nit said of the infallibility of the Pope was derived and comparative;\r\nhe is possessed of that infallibility with which the divine Redeemer\r\nwilled that His Church should be endowed in defining doctrine regarding\r\nfaith and morals. History had conquered dogma here as it had done in\r\nthe chapter on authority. The declaration was not that the Church was\r\nas infallible as the Pope, which would have been the order had the\r\nhistorical consciousness traced the infallibility of the Church as\r\nderived from that of the Pope. The declaration was that the Pope was as\r\ninfallible as the Church,--a proof that his infallibility was derived\r\nfrom hers, and that historical consciousness dictated that order. This\r\ncomparative infallibility was all that was ascribed to the Pope in this\r\nartful but unskilful composition. But to what, according to the same\r\narticle, did the infallibility of the Church amount? This was rendered\r\nby the wording the point all essential, and the standard beyond which\r\ninfallibility could not extend. The Church was in the same article,\r\nand in words the most positive, dealt with as a body the consent of\r\nwhich was not to be taken into account. All, therefore, which the\r\ngreat Word had brought forth, was a declaration that the Pope was as\r\ninfallible as a body whose consent was not to be taken into account.\r\nThe world may be well content. The crafty were caught in their own gin\r\nwhen they renounced the consent of the Church. When men have long and\r\nsuccessfully argued in a circle, it is a delicate thing all at once, in\r\nthe heat of a July day, to break one half of the circle, and then to\r\ndeclare that the other half is perfectly round, quite as round as the\r\nwhole. Historically, the infallibility of the Church was first of all\r\nmade the base and measure of that of the Pope. Then, diplomatically,\r\nthe infallibility of the Church was reduced to a nullity. This nullity,\r\nby inexorable logic, falls back on all the infallibilities grown out\r\nof it, or measured by it. So the Decree is chaos in spite of all the\r\ncandles. But on one point it speaks not comparatively but positively.\r\nWithout comparison with anything on earth or above the earth, the\r\nDecrees of the Pope are pronounced irreformable. That is the one and\r\nthe only indisputable result.\r\n\r\nThe aspirant after infallibility stood, about, as he imagined, to\r\npronounce the word. He opened his lips, and by the candlelight read:\r\n\"The Decrees and Canons contained in the constitution just read are\r\nagreed to by all the Fathers, two excepted. We, therefore, with the\r\napproval of the Sacred Council, confirm these and those as now read,\r\nand define them by apostolic authority.\"\r\n\r\nThe anathema attached to the definition of infallibility strikes below\r\nthe feet of Protestants. It only anathematizes those who contradict\r\nthe definition. Protestants do not stoop to do so. They may freely\r\nadmit that the Pope is as infallible as the Church which made him\r\nirreformable, and for once they may believe more than the Pope, by\r\nadmitting that the Church is as infallible as he. They certainly are\r\nnot tempted to deny that the Pope, whether in his Decrees or out of\r\nthem, is irreformable. Here, again, they believe more than the Pope.\r\n\r\nThe _Civiltá_ states that now burst out a loud acclamation among the\r\nFathers, accompanied with salvos of artillery. The small crowd of\r\npriests and nuns, and such like, as Vitelleschi says, about the door\r\nof the Hall raised a shout. Quirinus says that the nuns cried \"_Papa\r\nmio_\"--My Pope. According to the _Acta Sanctæ Sedis_, St. Peter's was\r\nvery full of people, who broke forth in such applause that you would\r\nscarcely have believed that you were in the temple of the Prince of the\r\nApostles, hearing it echo again and again with these unwonted sounds.\r\n\r\nThe Irreformable then addressed his Bishops in the following\r\nallocution. In order to do so, according to the _Stimmen_, he had to\r\nmake several vain attempts, owing to the repeated applause of the\r\nFathers; an applause which recalls a sad word of Vitelleschi, that some\r\nare never so jubilant as when they have placed a new yoke on their\r\nnecks. At length the thunders of applause were still, and the waiting\r\nworld was ready to hear the first utterance of the first human being\r\never set up on a throne in a temple, by hundreds of men of full age and\r\nof sound reason, to utter to all the earth words never to be questioned\r\nor amended, much less recalled. Hush! _The Infallible_ gives forth the\r\nfirst oracle in his now acknowledged plenitude of power. Does it sound\r\nlike \"the word of God,\" at whose potent spell a disordered world will\r\nrise to new order and repose, or like that of an old man chiding the\r\nabsent bishops who had not adorned the triumph of the day?\r\n\r\n    This exalted authority of the Roman Pontiff, venerable brethren,\r\n    does not oppress, but assists; does not destroy, but builds up and\r\n    often confirms in dignity, unites in affection, and strengthens\r\n    and protects the rights of brethren--that is, of the bishops. Let\r\n    those who now judge in the earthquake know that the Lord is not in\r\n    the earthquake. Let them remember that, a few years ago, holding\r\n    different views, they copiously expressed themselves as of our own\r\n    opinion, and that of the majority of this great assembly; but they\r\n    then judged in the calm. In judging of the same case, can we have\r\n    two opposing consciences? God forbid! May God, therefore, enlighten\r\n    their minds and their hearts; and as He alone works great marvels,\r\n    may He illuminate their minds and hearts, so that all may come to\r\n    the breast of their Father, that of the unworthy Vicar of Jesus\r\n    Christ on earth, who loves them, who esteems them, and who longs to\r\n    be one with them. And so, bound together in the bond of charity,\r\n    may we be able to fight the battle of the Lord, so that our enemies\r\n    may not deride us, but may rather fear us, and may in time lay down\r\n    the weapons of wickedness before the truth; and may we all be\r\n    enabled to say with St. Augustine, \"Thou hast called me into Thy\r\n    wonderful light, and lo, I see!\"[474]\r\n\r\nThe bishops applauded, and the journals found the allocution divine.\r\nThe Liberal Catholics, however, felt that when the Pope said, \"I\r\ndesire to be one with them,\" he meant, \"I desire to see them submit\r\nto me.\" The grave point was, that this being the first utterance from\r\nthe chair after he had been solemnly declared to be as infallible\r\nas the Church, an utterance made--if ever one could be made--in the\r\nexercise of his office as pastor of the universal Church, it contained\r\na misstatement of fact and a misconception of doctrine. The Pope,\r\noccupied with the absentees, ventured roundly to assert that they who\r\nnow opposed had been a few years ago fully of his opinion and of that\r\nof the majority. If ever a public misstatement deserved to be called\r\nby a strong short name, this one did. Had the language of the Decree,\r\nnow lifted to the level of the law that changeth not, been put by a\r\nProtestant, as the doctrine of their Church, before Schwarzenberg and\r\nRauscher, before Darboy and Dupanloup, before Strossmayer, Kenrick,\r\nClifford, and MacHale, any day previous to the year 1870, they would\r\nhave railed at the Protestant as a slanderer, and perhaps would not\r\nhave let him escape without an episcopal curse. Would not Spalding have\r\nsneered at D'Aubigné as a fool and a false witness had he said that the\r\nPope could make a dogma without either the counsel of bishops or the\r\nconsent of the Church? No, the ears of the Pope were full of words of\r\nwitness; the bureaux of the Council contained document after document\r\nin evidence that the statement which he now dared to make when none\r\ndared to contradict, was not true, and was known not to be true. Those\r\nbishops, in order to please the Pope, had unwisely, as they now felt,\r\nstretched the doctrine of primacy, which they did hold, till it looked\r\nto unpractised eyes very like Papal infallibility. True, they had done\r\nthis in what seemed rather to be addresses of ceremony than formularies\r\nof doctrine; for whenever infallibility itself had been nakedly\r\npresented to them, even without the adjunct of ordinary jurisdiction\r\nin every diocese, and without any repudiation of the consent of the\r\nChurch, they had mustered the manhood to oppose it. The Pope neither\r\nstated the facts nor discriminated between opinion and opinion. He did\r\nstate as fact what was not fact, and confounded opinions that differed.\r\nFriedrich, with the acute author of the _Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum_,\r\nand not a few others, thinks that he is personally incapable of\r\nunderstanding theological distinctions, and that he could not explain\r\nwhat the doctrine of Papal infallibility means. This seems to be\r\nimpossible, and yet there is very much to prevent one from pronouncing\r\nit ridiculous. But whether he is capable of distinguishing in such a\r\ncase or not is a very slight matter. The fact that remains for us is,\r\nthat his first utterance from the acknowledged seat of infallibility\r\nwas wholly occupied with the absent bishops, that he insinuated that\r\nthey had a double conscience, and that the grounds on which he made\r\nthat insinuation were incorrect in fact and inaccurate in thought. Had\r\nthe question whether the Papacy was a divine organ of truth, or merely\r\na contrivance of clever old men, liable to be overseen, like other\r\nmortals, in their words and deeds, been designedly subjected to a fair\r\ntest, we can with difficulty conceive of one fairer or more conclusive,\r\nthan that first utterance from the recognized seat of inerrancy. There\r\nis nothing divine in it, and the human elements do not rise above a\r\nvery ordinary level.\r\n\r\nThe city was silent and chill. We can form but a faint idea of how\r\nmuch, in such a case, mere external impressions sway a community\r\ntrained like the one of which we speak. It was as if the salvos from\r\nSt. Angelo, the feeble voice of the Irreformable, had been swallowed\r\nup in the salvos of the skies, the voice of the Sole Infallible. The\r\n_Giornale di Roma_ and the _Civiltá_, the _Univers_ and the _Unitá_,\r\nwould have spared no epithets in denouncing the man who three months\r\nbefore should have said that, on the night when the creative word, the\r\nfiat, Let there be light, should be uttered; on the night when the\r\npatient voice of the people and of the priests should be hushed under\r\n\"the voice of God\" proclaiming infallibility, a noble Roman would\r\npen what Vitelleschi that night quietly wrote down: \"The government\r\noffices, the religious establishments, and a few private houses, were\r\nilluminated; but the rest of the city remained in perfect silence and\r\nprofound darkness.\"\r\n\r\nThe concluding words of the Roman writer, in narrating the triumph of\r\nthe day, are not wholly indifferent to us in England (p. 221)--\r\n\r\n    History is bound to award to the author and originator of every\r\n    work the praise or blame which is due to him. All must remember the\r\n    part taken by the Fathers of the _Civiltá Cattolica_, and Monsignor\r\n    Manning, Archbishop of Westminster, in promoting the dogma of the\r\n    personal infallibility of the Pope, and all know that it was their\r\n    mind and their will that carried it. On the day of the promulgation\r\n    of the dogma, Monsignor Manning received as a gift from the Society\r\n    of the Jesuits, a portrait of Bellarmine, with the following\r\n    inscription--\r\n\r\n Henrico Edwardo Manning,\r\n    Archiep. Westmonast.\r\n     Sodales Soc. Jesu;\r\n Collegii Civilitatis Catholicæ,\r\n Sessionis IV Concilii Vaticani\r\n        Mnemosynon.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the portrait was really that of St. Charles Borromeo.\r\n\r\nOne other note was often made as to this memorable day. It was the same\r\nday on which was done the deed that irrevocably sealed the fall of the\r\nSecond Empire, and consequently the fall of its pendant and _protégé_,\r\nthe Papal throne. The declaration of war was delivered in Berlin on the\r\nday following, and must have left Paris that day!\r\n\r\nThe reader having already had several specimens, and fair ones, of\r\n_Ce Qui se Passe au Concile_, is in a position, so far as relates to\r\nit, to form his own opinion of its \"stinking calumnies,\" to adopt\r\nthe characteristic language of the Most Eminent, Most Reverend, and\r\nRight Reverend Fathers of the Council. But as to _La Dernière Heure du\r\nConcile_ (The last hour of the Council), we may at this point fitly\r\ngive a few examples. It speaks of \"Rules imposed in violation of the\r\nmost manifest rights of the Council, of Commission chosen beforehand,\r\nof illusory votes, of an oppressive tutelage, of discussions without\r\norder and without aim, of modifications of the Rules as arbitrary\r\nas they were multiplied.\" It asserts that as to the minority public\r\ncalumnies were not spared them; that their speakers were more than\r\nonce forced to leave the desk without being able to explain, much less\r\nto defend their views; while the majority from the beginning took the\r\nreasons of the minority for insults, and rendered back insults for\r\nreasons; and that the petitions of the minority were not only left\r\nwithout effect, but without answer. It pictures the Jesuits as meeting\r\nthe bishops after three centuries of feigned truce on the ground where\r\ntheir General Laynez, defeated at Trent, had left them; but as now\r\ncoming perfectly prepared for the battle, while the bishops had not\r\nforeseen anything--\r\n\r\n    To-day it is not the episcopate that refuses to hear Father\r\n    Laynez, but it is Father Laynez who, master of the field, does\r\n    not even deign to listen to the episcopate, and announces to it\r\n    that the question has been long decided.... The day that Pius\r\n    IX said, There shall be a Council, the Company of Jesus said, I\r\n    shall be the Council. We have seen three of its doctors absorb\r\n    both the doctrinal power of the august assembly, and its right\r\n    of initiative. The bishops have been called to sanction what the\r\n    Jesuits have written, and there is the whole history of the Council.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Propaganda, the writer declares that it holds in its\r\nhands all the Vicars Apostolic, and most of the Oriental bishops.\r\nTaking advantage of its annual grants, it gives week by week to the\r\nprelates who are supported by them that special impulse which shapes\r\nthe Council. In winter it set watch before the doors of the poor\r\nOriental bishops and obliged them to shut their cells against brethren\r\nwho came to visit them. Thus it comes to pass\r\n\r\n    that the word of two hundred Fathers of the oecumenical assembly\r\n    always remains the word of the Pope alone. In fact, hitherto it is\r\n    a thing unheard of that a single one of these prelates, sons of the\r\n    Propaganda, should have the courage to speak before the Council or\r\n    to vote otherwise than it would have them do. This single proof is\r\n    of incomparable and demonstrative force, as against the reality of\r\n    their freedom; for while all the other Churches, without exception,\r\n    have had some independent voices, the Church which I shall call\r\n    that of the Propaganda has not hitherto produced one.\r\n\r\nProceeding to the most tender point of all, the writer says--\r\n\r\n    Above this _surveillance_ of an institution the Jesuits have\r\n    contrived another, which is shown more rarely, and is reserved for\r\n    great events. This reaches the heads that are loftiest, even when\r\n    they are held up, and it makes those who might feel a movement of\r\n    independence tremble in spite of themselves. I mean the authority\r\n    of Pius IX. Too long it has been sought to keep his action in the\r\n    background, in the private history of the Council, by casting into\r\n    the shade a figure which is entitled to stand in a strong light.\r\n    Hitherto the writers of history have, at each new incident in the\r\n    Council, been content to say, It is the work of the Roman Court.\r\n    Well, the Roman Court is Pius IX, and history, when the hour comes,\r\n    rending the covering of mystery, must let every one bear the\r\n    responsibility which belongs to him. It will have to say that it is\r\n    Pius IX who would have the Council in spite of the Cardinals, and\r\n    who now will have, in spite of them, his personal infallibility.\r\n    It is he who required for the Council this hall where one cannot\r\n    hear; it is he who became irritated with Audu and tore from him\r\n    the abdication of his rights; it is he who refused to receive the\r\n    petition of the minority requesting that unhappy debates should be\r\n    averted; it is he who violated all rule in bringing on the burning\r\n    question; it is he who suddenly smothered discussion when it\r\n    became menacing for his pretensions; it is he who from the clergy\r\n    of Rome required an address which they had at first refused; it\r\n    is he who dismissed Theiner to reward Cardoni; it is he who by a\r\n    classification to be much regretted distressed the prelates who on\r\n    the anniversary day of his election came to congratulate him; it\r\n    is he who called Guidi after his speech to subdue his independent\r\n    spirit; is it he who from the Council demands either his personal\r\n    infallibility or else the courage to die from the heat of the\r\n    sun and of the fever; it is he who will be everything, both the\r\n    universal faith and tradition--_La tradizione son io!_ Never was\r\n    absolutism seen so near at hand, in an institution which Jesus\r\n    Christ had founded free and independent in spite of its monarchical\r\n    and indivisible unity.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the case which most distressed the writer seemed to\r\nbe that studied humiliation of the bishops which marked the whole\r\nprocedure of the Pope, and especially that raising against them of\r\ntheir own subordinates which bishops probably thought was a measure\r\nreserved only for employment against civil rulers, not against\r\n\"Venerable Brethren.\" Contrasting the present excesses with those of\r\nthe Popes of the middle ages the writer proceeds--\r\n\r\n    At present we stand in presence of the Papacy struggling, not\r\n    against princes, but against the episcopacy; as if Pius IX could\r\n    find on the ruin of his brethren a more elevated throne, or in\r\n    their annihilation a more impregnable fortress. O misfortune of\r\n    the times and abuse of the most holy institutions! They want to\r\n    have only a single real bishop in the world--the Pope; a single\r\n    infallible and authorized doctor--the Pope! Let every voice be\r\n    silent unless to say what he has said; let no action be performed\r\n    but under his episcopal jurisdiction--universal, immediate; let\r\n    those who have been appointed by God to govern, renounce their\r\n    imprescriptible rights; let them tear the pages of the gospel on\r\n    which those rights are graven; we do not any longer want more than\r\n    one mouth, one hand, an absolute monarch; then, say they, only\r\n    then, shall we have universal order.... At present the Caesars\r\n    disappear everywhere and visibly; in vain do I look for a Louis XIV\r\n    or a Joseph II; governments are essentially transformed and are\r\n    confounded with the country which at least has no courtiers. There\r\n    now remains in reality but one Caesar, who is himself everything\r\n    both in spiritual matters and in temporal, dispensing his favours\r\n    to those who defend him, and making those who contradict him feel\r\n    his wrath; and this Caesar is not called either Francis Joseph or\r\n    Napoleon III.\r\n\r\n    And while this time all temporal powers have scrupulously respected\r\n    the liberty of the Council, a single one has hampered it in every\r\n    way, has dreaded and destroyed it. I need not name the one. Thus\r\n    the Church which had furnished to modern civil societies the model\r\n    of a monarchy, in which the aristocratic and popular elements\r\n    effectually tempered the excess of the supreme power, the Church\r\n    which had first of all given to the modern world the example of\r\n    its great assemblies, discussing in freedom the rights of truth\r\n    and justice--this Church presents to us to-day the spectacle of a\r\n    Council without liberty and the menace of an absolutism without\r\n    control.\r\n\r\nThis will suffice to account for the displeasure of the Pope and the\r\nJesuits; but whether it sufficed to warrant the action of the Council\r\nand its language, posterity will judge. In our climate the allusion to\r\nthe cruelty of keeping the old men in Rome in what is there called \"the\r\nseverest season,\" would seem overstrained. But the danger of attending\r\na conclave in that season will be found described by Mr. T.A. Trollope\r\nas greater than that of a soldier on the field of battle. And his\r\ndetails of a conclave held in July to elect the Barberini Pope, gives\r\nfrightful corroboration of that serious statement.[475] As M. Veuillot,\r\nlooking from the point of view of the initiated, had at once leaped to\r\nthe conclusion of the Pope only; and as Vitelleschi, reasoning from\r\nthe data furnished by the Canons presented to the Council, inferred\r\nthat all that would remain of earthly authority would be the Pope\r\nonly; so this writer, starting from the episcopal point of view, and\r\nwith difficulty rising above it, at last stands face to face with the\r\nsole figure of authority left, the Pope only; and he finds that while\r\nthe spirit of Christianity has been changing Caesars into mild and\r\npatriotic princes, another spirit has changed the Bishop of Rome into a\r\nCaesar, claiming all supremacy in things temporal and spiritual.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 464: Vol. ii. 427.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 465: _Friedberg_, p. 622; _Quirinus_, 797.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 466: Vol. ii. p. 436.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 467: _Civiltá_, VII. xi. 367.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 468: The names are given in _Friedberg_, p. 149.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 469: _Vitelleschi_ says that of 157 absent only 38 were\r\naccounted for.

The enthusiasts had, on religious grounds, foretold that the\r\nutterance of the \"creative word,\" would be attended with portentous\r\nreligious effects. A Baptism of Fire, a New Pentecost, a rapidly\r\ndiffused reign of righteousness all the earth over, and other such\r\nexpressions, intimated the marvels that were to inaugurate the fresh\r\nera. The calculating men had counted on the display of power and union,\r\nwhereof the Papacy was made the centre, to produce a great impression\r\nupon princes and politicians; an impression to which they would, on the\r\nother hand, be predisposed by the fear of revolution.\r\n\r\nThus, when the consummation should be reached, and a ruler should be\r\nsolemnly set up by the bishops of the whole Church before the kings\r\nof the earth, like, to use the favourite simile of the time, the Lord\r\nsetting His King upon His holy hill of Sion; and when this king should\r\nbe officially declared to have the government upon his shoulders, to be\r\ninvested with all authority for the moral regulation of human affairs,\r\nthey expected that the princes, bowing down, would accept him as their\r\nsupreme judge and arbiter. Indeed, at one time, the confident talk, not\r\nmerely of men among themselves, but of the publications most in the\r\nconfidence of the guiding men, had been about laying down conditions\r\nto kings and governments on which they might hope to rule in peace.\r\nHints had not been spared, that only two alternatives could be allowed\r\nto them--the acceptance of the new moral order on the one hand, or the\r\nloss of their places on the other.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of society to what was called the Catholic ideal,\r\nits reconstruction on the new divine basis, its deliverance from the\r\nchronic plagues which in modern times had wasted it, were at once to\r\nbegin, and moral order was to smile where of late chaos had lowered.\r\nAlready these theorists beheld society crying for the Pope as its\r\nsaviour. Furthermore, during the days of preparation for the Council,\r\nand during its deliberations, only one among all the nations had been\r\nsingled out for solemn blessing and glowing assurances that God would\r\nnot forget her services to the Church. Italy had been warned and\r\ncursed. Austria and her new constitution had been formally condemned.\r\nRussia had been laid under every possible anathema. Spain, ever since\r\nher change of government, had shared the same condemnation. As to\r\nthe heretical countries, they were generally left, without separate\r\nmention, in the depths to which their sins had sunk them. But the\r\nUltramontane organs in Germany and France had marked Prussia out for\r\nsignal detestation, and denounced the union of Germany under the\r\nleadership of Prussia for the relentless opposition of the Church of\r\nGod. France alone was blessed with the withering benediction of the\r\npriest.\r\n\r\nThe hour had come that was to show how far the seers had read the\r\nfuture, and how far the calculators had reckoned well. So far as\r\nrelated to the great dogma, and the definition of it, all that had been\r\ndesigned was happily accomplished; indeed, more completely accomplished\r\nthan had been proposed in any design avowed up to the eleventh hour.\r\nSo far, therefore, both seers and calculators were justified. They had\r\nnot seen a false vision, so long as they contemplated the dogmatic\r\nissue; nor had they reckoned without their host, so long as they had\r\nreckoned upon bishops, priests, and friars. Events were now to tell how\r\nfar the transformation of Society into the accepted model, how far the\r\nhomage of kings, how far the self-surrender of Parliaments, how far the\r\nsubmission of codes to be remodelled by the Church, and how far the\r\ngeneral consent of the human race to be guided by him who claimed to\r\nhold the place of God among men, were to pass from the realm of hope\r\ninto that of experience.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the Council, and of opinion contemporary with its\r\nsittings, had dissipated many illusions. Even the bishops had to be\r\nconquered, and were not won. Europe had been awakened and had not been\r\nattached, but alienated. Great as the glories of the spectacles had\r\nconfessedly been, and much as they dazzled spectators, they had not\r\ncarried legislative effect, except where the artistic legerdemain had\r\nadmitted of immediate application. The vote of the minority on July\r\n13 was one symptom of failure. Their final record of dissent, put\r\ninto the Pope's own hand, was a more serious symptom. Their flight\r\nfrom the last public session was more serious still. The absence of\r\nthe representatives of the governments from that session was yet far\r\nmore depressing. All, therefore, that was now to be hoped for from the\r\nChurch was submission; and the very utmost that any calculating man\r\ndared to hope for from governments was endurance. The worst was that\r\nstatesmen had learned much more than they were ever meant to learn,\r\nand had seen into matters a deal further than laymen ought to see. And\r\nso the first night of the new dispensation closed in under dull skies,\r\nboth physically and morally.\r\n\r\nWhen the Romans, always curious to see how facts can be dressed for\r\nappearance outside of the walls, looked to the _Giornale di Roma_ for\r\nan account of the session, they found there that all the bishops who\r\nhad not appeared--upwards of two hundred--were placed in one class,\r\n\"absent from different legitimate and recognized reasons.\" This was\r\nfollowed by the assertion that \"the great majority of them held the\r\nsame doctrine as that which had been defined.\" Accustomed as the Romans\r\nare to this method of putting facts in vestments, the occasion was\r\nsolemn before God and exposed to the eye of man. Vitelleschi wrote\r\nthat in these representations the minority might find \"a foretaste of\r\nthe false statements and judgments they must in future expect.\" Some\r\nreadily account for such assertions by saying that it was hoped that\r\nthe documents which proved the contrary would never come to light.\r\nBut much is due to the habit of reckoning on the power of a great\r\norgan to set officials upon repeating what it says, till the facts are\r\nforgotten. The _Civiltá_ copied these statements, and yet at a later\r\ndate gave a truer account of the absentions.\r\n\r\nIt said: Cardinals, 42 _pro_ and 4 _contra_; Patriarchs, 6 _pro_ and 2\r\n_contra_; Primates, 6 _pro_ and 2 _contra_; Archbishops, 80 _pro_ and\r\n18 _contra_; Bishops, 349 _pro_ and 47 _contra_; Abbots and Generals,\r\n40 _pro_ and only 1, a Chaldean, _contra_. The same article, however,\r\ndoes not shrink from asserting that \"many\" of the minority voted\r\n_Placet_ in the public session.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest solicitudes of the Curia were now to begin. Events had\r\nbeen so guided that so long as they were dealing with their own\r\ninstruments, the bishops and the clergy, they were left completely\r\nto effect their purpose. Now came the point where they were to\r\noperate upon mankind. That society which they had meant completely to\r\nsubjugate, flattering themselves that they were about to restore it,\r\nwas now placed face to face with them in an awful aspect, one which\r\nneither priests nor kings could fully interpret. Certain it was,\r\nhowever, that neither kings nor \"peoples\" were upon their knees before\r\nthe Vicar of God, or were inclined to go down upon them. Some feared\r\nthat instead of kings and nations appealing to him to save them, he\r\nwould soon be found appealing to some one to save him. The fortunes\r\nof the restored empire of the Bonapartes, and those of the restored\r\nPapacy, had been bound up together. Men now watched and whispered,\r\nsaying that as they had been strangely united in their lives, perhaps\r\nthey would not be divided in their fall. The 13th of July, the day\r\nof the voting which gave the Pope his fatal majority, was the day of\r\nthe incident at Ems. It was the day also on which the Duc de Gramont\r\ninformed the French Chambers that, although the Hohenzollern candidate\r\nfor the throne of Spain had been withdrawn, that did not close the\r\ndispute. The 18th of July, the day on which the Pope read out by\r\ncandlelight the Decree upon his own infallibility, was the day on which\r\nNapoleon despatched his fatal declaration of war to Berlin. A baptism\r\nof fire had been often and pompously foretold as the result of the\r\ngreat dogma. After its promulgation all that the world ever heard of a\r\nbaptism of fire was when Napoleon telegraphed to the Empress, whom the\r\ndevout regarded as the true author of the war, telling her, in loud\r\nbrag before the nations, how her boy had received his baptism of fire.\r\nThat again was but two days before simultaneous sorrows sounded the\r\nknell of the empire and of the throne which sheltered under the shadow\r\nof its wing--the two embodiments of arbitrary will calling itself\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nOn August 4, the Pope was chafing at the news that the French troops\r\nat Civitá Vecchia had actually commenced embarkation. On the same day\r\nBonaparte read the telegram from Wissenberg. On August 6, Count Arnim\r\non the Capitoline was writing to Berlin to tell his government that\r\nNapoleon had declined an offer of the Pope to mediate between the\r\nbelligerents, assigning as the ground that after the declaration of war\r\nnegotiations were too late. That same day came upon Napoleon the double\r\ndisasters of Wörth and Spichern. The reply of the King of Prussia to\r\nthe same offer of mediation on the part of the Pope was to the effect\r\nthat if the Pontiff would procure for him assurances of the pacific\r\nintentions of Napoleon, and guarantees against similar violations of\r\nthe peace in the future, he would not refuse to receive them from the\r\nhands of his Holiness.[476] The total result then of the first attempt\r\nat political action abroad, in the new character, was a simple failure.\r\nAt the same time political embarrassments at home were thickening, as\r\nthey had done every day since the fatal July 13.\r\n\r\nIt was after Rome had learned that the sun of Austerlitz had not shone\r\non the fields of Wörth and Spichern, that the first formal act occurred\r\nshowing that the Council had neither been dissolved nor prorogued. All\r\nthat the Pope had done was to give the bishops a general leave until\r\nNovember 11. Had everything gone smoothly, this arrangement would\r\nhave enabled the men of the Curia to go on as if they were a General\r\nCouncil. The step to which we allude was merely the formal addition of\r\ncertain names to the Committee on Church Discipline, to replace those\r\nwho had left Rome. And this is registered on August 13.\r\n\r\nMeantime an intimation was given of the style of adhesion to the Papacy\r\nin its renewed glory which would be acceptable at the Vatican. The\r\n_Civiltá_ selected for publication, \"by preference,\" as it expresses\r\nit, an address from the Society of Catholic Youth in Bologna. It stated\r\nthat, as if in recompense of the new and lofty honour to the Virgin\r\nMary procured by the word of Pius IX, Divine Providence had exalted in\r\nhis person the divine dignity of the successor of Peter to the summit\r\nof glory and power--\r\n\r\n    We shall ever keep our eyes fixed on Thee, the mirror of eternal\r\n    Truth. We shall ever keep them directed to this Apostolical Chair,\r\n    whence the waters of true wisdom and of eternal life perennially\r\n    flow. Speak, then, O Infallible Teacher, and we, the youthful\r\n    sons of the Catholic Church, will hear Your words as the words\r\n    of eternal wisdom; Your judgment shall be for us the judgment of\r\n    God; Your definition shall be as the definitions of God; Your\r\n    instruction as the instruction of God. In your authority as Vicar\r\n    of Christ we venerate the authority of God, and submitting our\r\n    mind and our heart to that authority, we have faith to sustain\r\n    the dignity of human nature in face of the pretentious tyranny of\r\n    haughty intellect spoiled and blinded by guilty passions.[477]\r\n\r\nThe historical tales which had for years been carried on in the pages\r\nof the _Civiltá_ under the title _The Crusaders of St. Peter_, from\r\nwhich we have occasionally given scenes, rather strangely happened,\r\nin the number of the _Civiltá_ for August 24, to come to an end. It\r\nconcluded with the list of the immortal dead, as recorded for the world\r\nin a monument which Italy may well preserve. The Pope did not know what\r\na record of the exotic character of his own power he was putting up.\r\nThe ideal of this monument, and of the methods by which the world was\r\nto be made Catholic, is given by the _Civiltá_ in a very few words--\r\n\r\n    It was the conception of Pius IX that, in the Agro Verano, on soil\r\n    consecrated by the tombs of the ancient martyrs, should arise the\r\n    memorial of the crusaders of the nineteenth century. And another\r\n    conception of Pius IX was the colossal group in marble which\r\n    represents St. Peter in the attitude of committing the sword to\r\n    a warrior in armour, who with the cross bears a flag, with the\r\n    legend, _The Catholic World_. Peter is Pius; the warrior is the\r\n    Christian army. The idea of the mission of that army glows in the\r\n    authoritative action of him who gives the commission, and in the\r\n    humble and generous action of him who receives the commission, and\r\n    is admirably expressed in two texts of Scripture beneath, drawn\r\n    from the Book of the Maccabees: \"Take this holy sword, a gift from\r\n    God, wherewith thou shalt overthrow the adversaries of my people\r\n    Israel.... For victory standeth not in the multitude of the army,\r\n    but strength cometh from heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThe names of the martyrs of this crusade are given, and among those\r\nwho fell in the Battle of Mentana is only one Italian. France,\r\nBelgium, Holland, England, Ireland, and Germany are all represented,\r\nand Switzerland still more strongly. In the other most considerable\r\nengagement, that of Monte Libretti, there is again but a single\r\nItalian. Among those who perished by being blown up in barracks in\r\nRome were several Italians, in large part musicians. That record is\r\ncertainly worth the keeping of Italy at any cost, and the setting of it\r\nup is only one of the manifold evidences of how blinded the Papacy was\r\nin the last days of its temporal power.[478] Well might the Pope in the\r\nSyllabus condemn the doctrine of non-intervention.\r\n\r\nOn August 15, a great \"function\" was celebrated at Rome, in the Church\r\nof St. Louis of the French, in commemoration of the name-day of the\r\nEmperor Napoleon--that modern Charlemagne who restored the Roman\r\nCatholic Church in France, and whose nephew restored the Pope to his\r\nholy city. Cardinal Bonaparte, the Marquis de Banneville, and all\r\nthe French notables attended in state. About the same time a sorely\r\nsmitten man, accompanied by his boy, was crossing the drawbridges of\r\nMetz, turning their faces to the rear, amid gibes and nicknames from\r\nthe French soldiery. While winding up the heights of orchard and of\r\nvineyard which overhang the beauteous dale of the Moselle, and when\r\nlooking on the fair uplands of Lorraine, upon which were sleeping,\r\nin happy obscurity, villages like St. Privat and Gravelotte, like\r\nRezonville and Mars La Tour, the withered Emperor and his yet unripe\r\nson might see French soldiers marching in retreat, but could not see\r\nthe Germans by whom they were being already outmarched. Meanwhile\r\nin Paris the two elect ladies of the Golden Rose--Isabella and\r\nEugénie--were spectators, the first sighing after a crown already lost,\r\nthe second trembling for a regency attained as if only to expedite\r\nthe breaking of the sceptre of her husband. Had either of them faith\r\nenough to believe that the Virgin could reward them for services done\r\nto the Holy Father by giving them the necks of their enemies? Our Lady\r\nof Victories, \"terrible as an army with banners,\" to quote a favourite\r\ntext with Jesuit writers, was propitiated at least by the Empress\r\nRegent.\r\n\r\nSo far the political calculations of the Curia had all been turned to\r\nvanity. Bavaria had not fraternized with the French, much less carried\r\nWürtemburg and Baden with her. The blast of invasion which was to sound\r\nthe death-knell of German unity had proved to be its mustering-cry.\r\nItaly up to the present moment had stood in awe of France, but if the\r\nlatter should receive another blow or two, matters might reach a pass\r\nat which the Italian government would have more cause to fear Garibaldi\r\nthan Napoleon--and then?\r\n\r\nNews soon arrived that the Germans, out-marching the French, had met\r\nthem in the villages which we have lately mentioned, the names of\r\nwhich were by that meeting written large on the memory of nations.\r\nThe poor Pope saw that Bonaparte, whom he had used and hated, was not\r\nlikely to retain power any longer to guard his temporal throne. He knew\r\nthat Italy was wiser than the first Bonaparte, who taught the French\r\nthat the Pope was to be treated as if he had two hundred thousand\r\nbayonets--a lesson that has cost them dear. Italy adopted the principle\r\nthat, in respect of bayonets, the Pope was to be counted as worth just\r\nas many as he could command. Italy would also treat him more wisely as\r\na teacher. She would not incarcerate, exile, or personally insult him,\r\nbut would leave him free to bless or curse as he felt moved, and to be\r\nheeded or disregarded according as every man felt persuaded in his own\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nIt was with hearts weighted with the heavy news from the banks of the\r\nMoselle that the Fathers of the Council met in their Congregation on\r\nAugust 23. How changed that gathering from the proud assembly of last\r\nDecember, which challenged the homage of all kings, and at the sight\r\nof which the Margottis and the Veuillots spoke of our Parliaments as\r\npuppet-shows! Those whose organs of the Press a few months before wrote\r\nas if neither kings nor presidents had any long tenure of power, except\r\nas they might make their peace with the Church, felt themselves to\r\nsit amid the indifference of mankind, and under the menacing strokes\r\nof Providence. The bishops who had warned them of their ignorance and\r\nfolly, but had been crushed, were now far away. In the Congregation,\r\nthe Fathers discussed some matters of Church discipline, but as the\r\nshadow of Sadowa had arrested all preparations for the Council during\r\nfourteen months, and that of Garibaldi for three or four, now a darker\r\nshadow, projected from Wörth and Gravelotte, was falling upon the\r\nremaining ecclesiastics, as the evening gloom of the Aventine falls\r\non late gamblers in what was once the Circus Maximus. They had played\r\nfor the certainty of the temporal power, and for the reversion of\r\nthe lordship of the world. They had boldly staked all episcopal and\r\nclerical rights. The upshot was that the losers had lost, and that the\r\none winner was to be a loser too. The next news showed them that, on\r\nthe very day when they thus met, was completed the investment of Metz.\r\nThus did they see the thrice beaten but still coherent army of Bazaine\r\naltogether cut off from the routed and disorganised army of MacMahon.\r\nThey had fixed to meet again on September 1.\r\n\r\nThe Fathers probably felt that it was doubtful whether the Congregation\r\nfixed for September 1 would meet; but it was highly politic to keep up\r\nthe airs of a General Council, because it increased the sanctity of the\r\ncity, and made it morally more difficult for Italy to attack. Ere they\r\nmet, it became known that at Beaumont, Failly--the faithful General\r\nFailly, the leader of the expedition of Mentana, lauded and blessed for\r\nhis \"prodigious chassepots\"--had met the Bavarians, soldiers of that\r\nking whom the _Unitá_ never wearied of insulting, and that at their\r\nhands Failly had lost his guns, his baggage, and his camp, a large\r\npart of his men, and all his reputation. The Congregation of September\r\n1, did meet, and it was the last. While Bishop Quinn, of Brisbane, in\r\nAustralia, was offering up the Mass, the undulating plateaux around\r\nSedan were reeking with an incense which had, within the last few\r\nyears, been invoked with lamentable frequency by the organs of the\r\nVatican. As the Fathers were rising from their afternoon siesta, tens\r\nof thousands of blue and grey eyes, from all the heights commanding\r\nthe city of Turenne, began to dance for joy at seeing the white flag\r\nwaving from the old castle lying low down in the hollow--ay, the white\r\nflag waving over the Imperial head of him who to them represented the\r\ntraditional devastators of the German Fatherland, but who was, to the\r\nbishops of the Council, the prince who for twenty years had been the\r\nstay of the temporal power.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the news from Sedan reached the Agro Romano, than Curia\r\nand peasant alike knew all that was to follow. One week after that day\r\nthe Fathers gathered, on September 8, for the last great ceremony, or,\r\nas it was called, \"the last extra conciliar act.\"[479] The remains of\r\nthe world-transforming host of December now speckled the noble Piazza\r\ndel Popolo, pressing to the great church of Santa Maria. It was the\r\nFestival of the Nativity of the Virgin. All that the _Civiltá_ tells\r\nof the day is that there were great expectations, and that the Feast\r\nof the Immaculate Conception, then three months distant, would witness\r\na splendid session. We should say that there was no expectation of the\r\nsort, except indeed among the few who really counted on the Virgin as\r\nbeing certain at last to work for the Pope the miracles which it had\r\nbeen so often suggested that she was in gratitude bound to perform.\r\nThe majority calculated that she had acquitted all her debts to him by\r\nmaking him infallible. Desirable as it was to keep up the appearance\r\nthat Rome was just then the seat of a General Council, they knew that\r\nthough for us and other remote people beyond the mountains that might\r\nhave a sacred sound, for the Italians it was not a name to conjure with.\r\n\r\nOn the very day when the Fathers were cheerlessly performing this final\r\nceremony, a notification was sent forward by Victor Emmanuel that he\r\nwas unable longer to stay the impetus of the nation, which panted to\r\ntake possession of its capital. The letter of the king was weak and\r\ndisingenuous. It was more like the work of a priest than of a soldier.\r\nHe affected to be a good Catholic, while deliberately dethroning the\r\nVicar of God. He affected to hope that the Pope would acquiesce in\r\nhis own dethronement. The reply of the Pontiff was more worthy of his\r\nposition, and more becoming his professions.\r\n\r\nThis hostile movement called out a quality in which Popes are surely\r\ninfallible, that of appealing to foreigners for armed intervention\r\nagainst their own countrymen. Of all men, to whom should the Pope now\r\nturn but to the King of Prussia--as if the King of Prussia did not\r\nknow at what the Pope and his instruments had been aiming! The date of\r\nthe reply of King William was in itself a history. He wrote from the\r\ncapital of fair Champagne. Already had the tide of war closed round\r\nthe hot infallibilist Räss in his stately Cathedral of Strasburg;\r\nand, rolling on, it had, under the shadow of St. Remy, enveloped the\r\ndeserter from the Opposition, Landriot, in his thrice beautiful fane at\r\nRheims.\r\n\r\nSt. Remy sent no sufficing homage by the hand of King William. The\r\nsoldier-king quietly declined to undertake any such political\r\nintervention as the priest-king desired. In one word, he dispelled\r\nthe idea of the venerable applicant, that the cause of Prussia was\r\nimplicated. The matter, said King William, is one \"which does not, as\r\nyour Holiness appears to think, in any way affect the interests of\r\nPrussia.\" That calm word would provoke many a vow to make the heretic\r\nfeel that the Pope could affect the temper of millions of his subjects,\r\nand therefore the interests of his government.\r\n\r\nYet one week from the notification of Victor Emmanuel, and on September\r\n15, rode up an Italian staff officer, with all the forms of war, to\r\nthe Milvian Bridge--that _Pons Milvius_ ever memorable for the victory\r\nof Constantine and the death of Maxentius. The latest addition to\r\nits history of military incidents, which began with the conspiracy\r\nof Catiline, had been made one-and-twenty years previously, when the\r\ninsurgent Romans defeated an attempt to carry the bridge made by the\r\nFrench under Oudinot. The point of meeting did not, therefore, seem\r\nto be one of good omen for Pius IX. The Italian officer was Colonel\r\nCount Caccialupi, or Chase-the-Wolves. He came from General Cadorna to\r\ndemand, in the name of the King of Italy, the surrender of the city.\r\nOn behalf of his Holiness, General Kanzler at once gave his reply. The\r\nplace was to be defended. General Bixio on that day closed in upon\r\nCivitá Vecchia.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Count Arnim, in the hope of averting bloodshed, plied\r\nbetween the city and the Italian camp. The Pope, however, was resolved\r\nupon resistance. He did, indeed, give orders that it should be\r\ncontinued only so long as to compel the Italians to open a breach,\r\nin order, as he said, to attest the fact that his capital fell by\r\nviolence. That end, we might have thought, would have been equally\r\nwell answered, without bloodshed, by surrendering after the first gun.\r\nThe forces of the Pope numbered eight thousand, and those of Cadorna\r\nfifty thousand. Rapidly as the temporal power and the Second Empire\r\nwere both rushing downhill, it appeared as if they were constantly to\r\nkeep step. So did it fall out that on that very September 19, when\r\nthe Prussians, defeating Vinoy, closed round Paris, Cadorna, coming\r\nup from the north, sat down before gates of Rome. His lines stretched\r\nfrom the Salara Gate to the Gate of San Giovanni, thus enclosing that\r\ncemetery of St. Lorenzo, where stood the monument to the Crusaders,\r\nwith so many foreign and so few Italian names. Coming up from the\r\nsouth, General Angiolotti stretched from the Gate of St. Giovanni to\r\nthat of St. Sebastiano. Early the next morning Bixio, coming up from\r\nCivitá Vecchia, which he had captured, took post before the Gate of San\r\nPancrazio, remembered for the contest between Garibaldi and the French.\r\n\r\nWith the first light of September 20 did the chambers of the Vatican\r\nbegin to rattle with the sound of other artillery than the joy-guns of\r\nSt. Angelo. The last time that sound had disturbed those vaults was\r\nwhen it came as the voice of a French republic, commanding a Roman\r\nrepublic to make way for the most despotic rule in Europe. Now France\r\nwas learning for herself what it is to hear the guns of the stranger\r\nbefore the gates of the capital; and Rome was feeling what it is to\r\nhear the voice of the Fatherland bidding the stranger depart. Of the\r\ntwo potentates who in 1849 thundered at the weak walls of poor old\r\nRome, he who then acted the restorer was now an exile and a captive,\r\nwhile he who was then an exile panting for return, now sat in the halls\r\nto which he was then restored, but sat feeling in the thud of every gun\r\nthat even within those halls he too would soon call himself a captive.\r\n\r\nWhile the din pained the spirit of the aged Pio Nono, forty of the\r\nItalians attacking and twenty of the foreigners defending were killed,\r\nand a hundred and fifty of the assailants and fifty of the garrison\r\nwere wounded. Reports came that the heaviest fire was directed against\r\nthe Porta Pia, the gate particularly connected by name with his own\r\nname, adorned and restored by his liberality, and endeared to his\r\nmilitary recollections by the triumphal entrance of his crusaders from\r\nMentana less than three years before. A letter is published in which\r\nthe Pope ordered General Kanzler to surrender as soon as a breach\r\nshould be made. But it would not appear that he had really granted him\r\npower to do so; for the _Civiltá_ expressly says that the order to\r\nhoist the white flag was given by the Pope himself, and accounts for\r\nneedless bloodshed by the delay which occurred ere that order could\r\nreach the gate that was beleaguered.[480]\r\n\r\nSome five hours had passed since the horrid din began. No Michael\r\nwith his legions of angels, no Madonna terrible as an army with\r\nbanners, smote the host of the aliens. No Peter struck the barbarians\r\nwith blindness. No Dominic, with a cohort of sainted Inquisitors; no\r\nIgnatius, with a celestial \"Company,\" flashed death upon the worse\r\nthan Moslems who fought for uprisen Italy. All these things had been\r\nexpected. They came not, but instead of them came the news that a\r\nbreach at the Porta Pia invited the Italians in. At last the poor old\r\npriest-king made up his mind to stay the futile flow of blood. He\r\nknew the temper of his zouaves. They would have stood and died like\r\ncrusaders; but at last the word was given. There on the dome of proud\r\nSt. Peter's was the white flag, and there did it float out upon the\r\nSeptember breeze, and waved in the forenoon sun--waved over Pontiff and\r\nCardinal, over the Circus of Nero and the Inquisition of the Popes.\r\nWas it real? Eyes would be wiped to see if they did not deceive. Eyes,\r\nay, the eyes of soldiers, would be wiped from thick, hot tears. Could\r\nit be--could it ever be? Come at last! The hour for which ages had\r\nimpatiently waited, for which myriads of Italians had died. Italy\r\none! her arms outstretched from Etna and from Monte Rosa, clasping at\r\nlast every one of her children, and even availing by their returning\r\nstrength to lift up her poor old Rome from under the load of the priest\r\nand the stranger.\r\n\r\nHe who two brief months before had, amid deep darkness at noonday,\r\nread out, by artificial light, the Decree of his own unlimited power\r\nand irreformable law, lay down that night amid a rude and intrusive\r\nglare streaming from across the Tiber into the multitudinous windows\r\nof the Vatican. It came from the lights of Rome all ablaze with\r\nilluminations for the fall of the temporal power. In the piazza below\r\nlay the Pope's little army of foreigners, passing their last night in\r\nthe Holy City under shade of the basilica in which they had consecrated\r\ntheir bayonets to St. Peter, and within embrace of the two arms of\r\nthe glorious crescent colonnade. For true it is that stone cupolas,\r\nand stone columns, put up by the distant dead, may be of real avail\r\nas stays of a power after the hearts and hands of willing men have\r\nceased to hold it up. The soldiers passed the next morning in confused\r\npreparations for a departure. At noon a cannon was fired, and the Pope\r\nappeared on his balcony. He could not conceal his overpowering emotion.\r\nWith the retreating steps of these prisoners of war, were about to\r\nvanish mystic visions of martial feats crowned by divine miracle. The\r\nsoldiers raised their old cry, _Viva Pio Nono_, in loud and ringing\r\ntones; which, smiting against the basilica and the palace, were from\r\nthence rolled back, and flew across the stream, till the sound of _Viva\r\nPio Nono_ once more floated along the neighbouring streets of the\r\ncapital. Uprisen Italy, quietly sustaining her uplifted Rome, hearkened\r\nin silence to the foreign cheer. Then, for the last time, did the Pope\r\ngive to his beloved soldiers what they had so often received, his\r\nbenediction. As he withdrew, when the corridors opened lone and long\r\nbefore him, when the doors closed behind, cutting him off from the only\r\nbayonets on which he could rely, no wonder if he felt that the palace\r\nof the Pontiffs had become a prison.\r\n\r\nThe crusaders, turning to the left, passed out of the Gate Angelica;\r\nthen winding round under the windows of the Vatican, close by the\r\ngarden walls, and along the Janiculum, they finally reached the Gate\r\nof San Pancrazio, where Cadorna and his staff awaited them to receive\r\nthe formal surrender. Proud were the men under the red, white, and\r\ngreen, with the cross of Savoy, as they saw the head of the approaching\r\ncolumn. As the first men of the French legion came up they insulted the\r\nItalian staff. According to the _Civiltá_, Bixio was so incensed that\r\nhe reproached Cadorna for having conceded to such troops the honours of\r\nwar. The friendly writer extenuates their misconduct by alleging the\r\nirritation cause by affronts received from the rabble in the streets\r\non the previous day. But when the zouaves came up led by the brave\r\nColonel Charette, they behaved like soldiers (_Civiltá_, VIII. i. 212).\r\n\r\nWhen the crusaders of Pio Nono passed away from the Gate of San\r\nPancrazio, who would have dared to say that the sixty dead and the two\r\nhundred wounded of the day before were to be the last victims of war\r\nprovoked by Popes abusing the name of the Prince of Peace? And who\r\nwould not feel for the French crusaders, who, led by their priests, and\r\nthinking that they did God service, had for twenty years inflicted upon\r\nItaly, at the behest of the Pope, the miseries of foreign occupation,\r\nand now, in facing their own fair land, were to behold the foreigner\r\nseated in her proudest palaces.\r\n\r\nFrom that day forth, when the Roman met the priest on the street, he\r\nfelt that he was no longer bound, except at the dictate of his own\r\nconscience, to confess to him his sins; that, indeed, he was not even\r\nbound to purchase an Easter ticket, to be produced as evidence that\r\nhe had duly presented himself in a tribunal in which, in fact, he had\r\nnever set foot. From that day forth, when the friar entered the church\r\nof St. Ignatius, neither the great picture of the torments of the\r\nheretics, nor what, in his dialect, he might call the \"divine\" _lapis\r\nlazuli_, retained all its old brilliancy; for within those sacred walls\r\nthe internal tribunal of the kingdom of God was no longer anything\r\nmore than a voluntary confessional. From that day forth disappeared\r\nfrom the seats of justice on the Seven Hills the ecclesiastical\r\nmagistrate, and with him the external tribunal of the Church. From\r\nthat day forth appeared for the first time for long and weary ages,\r\nthe civil magistrates, sitting in open court under the eye of all,\r\nto administer, with whatever shortcomings, a law which accepted the\r\nChristian principle of even-handed justice to Jew and Gentile; to those\r\nwho said, We are of Cephas, and to those who only said, We are of\r\nChrist. In the eye of the Vatican this was the fall of the supernatural\r\norder, the godless triumph of naturalism; but in other eyes it was\r\nthe substitution of God's good ordinance for the contrivance of\r\npriestcraft, which, conscious that it was not natural, called itself\r\nsupernatural. From that day forth the Roman noble ceased to be a mere\r\ntitle-bearer and jewel-stand, for now a career in the government of his\r\ncountry opened before him. From that time forth the people ceased to\r\nbe a mere populace, and entered on the dignities of a democracy. Law,\r\nletters, science, politics, diplomacy, and oratory now called upon the\r\nbright-browed child of the working man to come and grace them with his\r\ngifts, and not to sit doomed to the destiny of the incapable, unless he\r\nwould put on the frock of the priest. From that day forth the double\r\noffice of Despot-Pontiff, answering to the ideal of later Pagan Rome,\r\nwas replaced by the mild office of the monarch, reigning at the head of\r\nan aristocracy and a democracy. The priest as a teacher of doctrines,\r\nas a celebrant of rites, or as a practitioner of charms, remained as\r\nfree as ever he had been before; but as a power to impose himself upon\r\nall, and as exclusive king of men, his reign had passed away. Italy\r\nsaid, \"For ever\"; the priest replied, \"Only for a very little time\"!\r\n\r\nOn October 2 the Italian government took a plébiscite in the Roman\r\nStates, to enable the people by a vote to record their own desire as to\r\nwhether they would belong to the kingdom of Italy or to the Spiritual\r\nState. According to the _Civiltá_, the voting in the Holy City was\r\n40,835 in favour of Italy, and 46 against. It must not be imagined that\r\nthe total amount of dissent was represented by the 46. The partisans\r\nof the supernatural order generally abstained; but probably they would\r\nhave done otherwise had they not known that, even if they all mustered,\r\nthe majority would be overwhelming. They, as usual, cried out against\r\nbribery, coercion, and similar wrongs. Indeed, to read the Papal\r\norgans at this day, one might believe that ever since the national\r\nmovement began, every vote and every battle has been carried against\r\nthe preponderating mass of Italians by some few Freemasons, Jews, and\r\ninvisible conspirators.\r\n\r\nThe Council which was to restore all things still sat. Not even a\r\nprorogation had taken place. Now, however, the Pontiff, though not\r\nintending to dissolve it, determined to suspend it until a happier\r\ntime. Exactly a month after Rome had passed into the hands of Italy,\r\nappeared on October 20 the Act by which the Council was suspended.\r\nIn the Bull of Convocation the Pope had spoken of his intentions for\r\nthe general benefit of society. In the Bull of Suspension it appeared\r\nthat the particular society which best knew him and his remedies had\r\nspewed them out of her mouth. After having for many centuries had\r\nexperience of his spiritual supremacy and temporal power, Italy had\r\nmournful proofs that they were socially evil. No land in Europe could\r\nproduce a record of any dynasty which had so often brought into it\r\nforeign armies, to beat its people down, and to keep them under. No\r\nland in Europe could, from times within the memory of living men,\r\nproduce such lists of the executed, the exiled, the imprisoned, and\r\nof those submitted to torture. No land in Europe had a ruling class\r\namong members of which public justice, when once free, had, week after\r\nweek, to deal with such vile immoralities as the Courts of Italy had\r\nto punish in members of the priesthood. Italy had made the last trial\r\nof priestly rule with a prince personally free from the social blots\r\nwhich in the case of many of his predecessors had complicated questions\r\nof the public weal with questions of personal vice. Under Pius IX the\r\nsystem stood out more fairly to be judged by its principles and by its\r\nfruits. And under Pius IX Italy had rung with accounts of moral wrongs,\r\nof crimes of power, of curses uttered by the subject, such as had long\r\nsince ceased to be heard of in other countries of Europe free from\r\nTurkish rule. The monstrosity that called itself a Spiritual State,\r\nand sneered at Lay States, was carnal, and vile to the core. The wave\r\nwhich, as soon as the breakwater of the Second Empire had been removed,\r\nrolled in at the Porta Pia, was even more a wave of moral scorn and of\r\nsocial execration than of political hostility.\r\n\r\nThe Council met amid florid promises that princes generally, at least\r\nCatholic ones, would accept the Vicar of God as their supreme judge,\r\nmingled with terrible citations of them all to appear before him,\r\nin order to find at one and the same time their correction and their\r\ndeliverance in his infallible sentence. All this was uttered with the\r\nhaughty spirit that goes before a fall. The fall after the haughtiness\r\ndid not tarry, and was strikingly indicated by a phrase under the hand\r\nof the High Priest himself, in the Bull of Suspension: \"We have been\r\nbrought into such a position as to be entirely under a hostile dominion\r\nand power, God in His inscrutable judgments having so permitted it.\"\r\nSociety had already beheld its self-proffered saviour clinging to the\r\nskirts of Napoleon III, and then crying to King William to save him\r\nfrom his fellow-countrymen. Now the kings heard their self-proffered\r\njudge himself declare that by a judgment truly supreme the temporal\r\npower had fallen--that power which he and all his bishops had\r\nseparately and unitedly assured the Church was altogether necessary to\r\nthe proper exercise of his office of universal bishop.\r\n\r\nWe heard the _Civiltá_, in September, foretell that when December 8\r\nshould come it would witness a splendid session. Now at last it came,\r\na waymark noting the end of a very eventful year--eventful in the life\r\nof France, in the life of Italy, in the life of the German nation, and\r\nin that of the Papal Church. But the anniversary of the Immaculate,\r\nof the Syllabus, and of the opening of the Vatican Council, brought\r\nwith it no splendid session. They who twelve months ago had met to\r\nsit in judgment on the nations were scattered, and were in various\r\nlanguages making strange explanations and dexterous appeals to allay\r\nthe general disquiet relating to their political plans; and in doing\r\nso were creating in the minds of all who understood what they said,\r\nand who knew what they had done, an impossibility of ever hereafter\r\ntrusting to representations of theirs. Meantime, without his seven\r\nhundred bishops, without his adoring crowds, without the glitter of\r\nfallen royalties and of quasi-civic dignitaries, without his beloved\r\nzouaves, yet still guarded by his stalwart and fantastic Swiss--for at\r\nthat Court it is ever foreign steel that is true--the Pope, sitting\r\nin a palace of eleven thousand apartments, rich as any king, and free\r\nas any bishop in the world, yet felt and called himself a prisoner.\r\nTherefore when the day of exciting memories came, it was, says the\r\n_Civiltá_, spent in mourning and desolation. But a new offering to the\r\nVirgin was to raise the sacredness of December 8, even in this year\r\nof sorrow, to a higher pitch than ever. Hitherto the patron of the\r\nHoly Church had been St. Michael the Archangel, under whose spear the\r\nfirst rebel fell--which rebel, as some time ago we saw, prefigured the\r\nlatest rebel, Garibaldi. Indeed, after Mentana, St. Michael was, as\r\nmilitary men say, \"mentioned\" in the Court journal. For the _Civiltá_,\r\nin relating the overthrow of the Garibaldians, did not fail to note\r\nthe fact that \"it was on the day consecrated to the Prince of the\r\nAngelic Host, to the Patron of the Holy Church, St. Michael,\" that\r\nthe invaders crossed the border. But now the Immaculate, who alone is\r\nterrible as an army with banners, who alone destroys all heresies, was\r\nto be further exalted, by the raising of her husband to that celestial\r\ndignity which had hitherto been borne by the great archangel. It was,\r\nsay the reverend college of writers in the ruling periodical, a grand\r\nconsolation that amid the mourning and desolation wherein December 8\r\nwas passed, the Decree proclaiming St. Joseph as the Patron of the\r\nCatholic Church was promulged. They add that this Decree was issued to\r\nsatisfy the Fathers of the Council, and that it might be considered\r\nas a firstfruit of devotion and piety reaped from the Council. The\r\nItalians said that St. Michael, as captain of the Lord's host, had not\r\nin late years wielded the sword to the satisfaction of the authorities.\r\nOthers said that the reason of the slight put upon him was simply\r\nthat St. Joseph was the patron of the Company of Jesus. Others again\r\nlooked no further for an explanation than to the fact that a form of\r\nreligion which now--whatever was imagined and in theory professed--had\r\nin reality no standard of faith left but that of the _fait accompli_,\r\nwould naturally seek change for the sake of rest.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that from centre to circumference of the Papal orb, the\r\ndevout were besieging the altars of those powers among whom Modern\r\nRome distributes the affairs of that department which was by Ancient\r\nRome assigned to Mars. In England, as the _Civiltá_ proudly tells,\r\nwas formed \"The Prayer League of our Lady of Victories, entirely\r\ncomposed of innocent children.\" In Vienna the arch-confraternity of\r\nSt. Michael called the citizens to a solemn novena; Belgium moved\r\nin a similar manner, and Spain on December 8 beheld the faithful\r\nthronging to the altars of Mary. \"Processions and pilgrimages\" added\r\na \"splendid\" demonstration, in which Belgium, Germany, and the Tyrol\r\nmerited particular mention. The tomb of St. Boniface was besieged with\r\npilgrims, praying that the tomb of Peter might be redeemed from the\r\nhands of the Italian Islamite. And the tomb of Henry the Emperor Saint,\r\n\"fierce defender of the rights of the Holy See,\" was so beset with\r\npilgrims on the day two months after the commencement of the captivity,\r\nthat the streets of Bamberg resounded with the suppliant song of\r\n_eighty-two_ processions seeking to move the warrior saint. In Munich,\r\nafter exhibiting in \"functions\" within the Churches \"all that is grand\r\nin the Catholic cult,\" the clergy, the archbishop, and the devout,\r\nin crowds said to comprise all Munich, paraded the streets chanting\r\nprayers for the ransom of the Pontiff.\r\n\r\nIf St. Michael had not retained his militant position, his\r\nconfraternity in Vienna, conscious of where lay the sinews of war, sent\r\nloads of Peter's Pence. So in point after point of Europe the vows\r\nand bonds assumed in favour of Peter's Pence by fresh associations\r\nfrom Holland to Portugal, and from England to Hungary, are recorded.\r\nIn England it was to the ladies that the \"work\" of raising Peter's\r\nPence was assigned. The ladies of Vienna claimed it, the ladies of\r\nMadrid followed the example. And a valiant meeting in Belfast, and a\r\nmeeting in Galway, resolved largely to swell the tide of Peter's Pence.\r\nThe Catholic clubs joined in the movement, not only to console the\r\nHoly Father, but to condemn \"the guilty policy of spoliation.\" Italy\r\nwas grievously complained of for having dealt, by law, with certain\r\nCatholic Associations as political bodies, committing offences against\r\nthe nation. But the great and splendid \"work\" of the Pence of Peter\r\nis not enough. The meetings and manifestoes are equally necessary, and\r\nof the manifestoes the spirit is breathed in these words, addressed\r\nto governments: \"Do us justice; or if not, to shake you out of your\r\nindifference, we shall avail ourselves of every means which the law\r\nallows.\"\r\n\r\nOne brave claim of German Catholics is this: \"As loyal subjects we\r\ndemand that our rights and our interests shall be protected even in the\r\nterritories of the Church.\" And politicians, _knowing these things_,\r\nwill say and write that men moved from a foreign centre to make such\r\nclaims of intervention on their governments are as good subjects as\r\nother men! They well know that such an agitation raised in the midst\r\nof a mortal struggle, if it succeeds, plunges the nation into a second\r\nwar; and even if it does not succeed, diverts the nation from its own\r\ndefence, and tends to divide it. But these German patriots say that\r\nthey will embrace every opportunity that arises of pressing such rights\r\nas those above indicated upon their governments, by the Press, by\r\n\"councils,\" by meetings, and especially by sending men to Parliament\r\nwho will have courage to take up the Catholic cause. The _Civiltá_\r\ncharacterizes this language as the proclamation \"of a vigorous, a\r\ncontinued, and a legal struggle against all governments which do not\r\ncare for the cause of the Pontiff.\" \"What the law allows,\" would, in\r\nthe mind of many an honest Catholic, mean the law of the land; but\r\non how many of such men could reliance be placed when, after all had\r\nbeen done which the law of the land allowed, they were instructed by\r\nsacred lips that when it contradicted the \"divine\" law it ceased to be\r\nbinding, and that then the law in the case was God's law, which was\r\nwhatever the Church declared it to be?\r\n\r\nGeneva was made a chosen centre of activity, and the names of great\r\nand famous personages were paraded. While the ultimate ends to be\r\naimed at were fitly expressed as \"reinstating the Holy Father in his\r\ntemporal sovereignty, and re-establishing the social reign of the\r\ngospel,\" the proximate ends were, to move the heart of Christ to mercy\r\nby pilgrimages and prayers, to act upon governments, to excite opinion\r\nby the Press, and to procure for the Pope means. Fifty meetings in the\r\nmiddle of December in the diocese of Fulda alone, while Germany was in\r\nthe crisis of the war; the object of those meetings being to plunge her\r\ninto a war with Italy! Indeed, it seemed to the _Civiltá_ as if, awoke\r\nfrom the slumber of ages by the prayers of the Catholics around his\r\ntomb, St. Boniface had gone out anew upon his apostolic pilgrimage, to\r\nrouse up the ancient devotion of the people to the Holy See.[481]\r\n\r\nOne new society, which has not its name specified, is said to be\r\nalready a great one. It is composed of all who had borne arms in the\r\ncrusade of Pius IX. From Holland to Marseilles, from Canada to the\r\nTyrol, they had bound themselves together in a common bond. We are\r\nnot left in doubt as to what that bond might be. Indeed, we are told\r\nthat \"what it is cannot be obscure; their former enterprise makes it\r\nclear.\" To us the former enterprise would make the means clear--namely,\r\nwar; but not so clear the end. They formerly warred to avert the fall\r\nof the temporal power. Were they now to go to war for the immediate\r\nand local object of \"reinstating the Holy Father,\" and at the same\r\ntime for the ulterior and world-conquering object of \"re-establishing\r\nthe social reign of the gospel\"; that is, of forming the world into\r\nSpiritual States, or at least into States under the spiritual reign\r\nof the clergy? The object is prudently veiled in vague language, but\r\nlanguage clear enough for the instructed; \"full of warlike ardour in\r\na meeting of Dutch and Belgians at Lovaine, they said that the aim of\r\ntheir union was to meet the future wants of the Church, was to conquer\r\nall the forces of impiety.\"[482] But even in the language put into the\r\nlips of soldiers, and into the resolutions of public meetings, the\r\nobject is never defined so as to limit it to restoring the temporal\r\npower, and generally a wide object beyond that narrow one is allowed\r\nto transpire. When old crusaders undertake with \"warlike ardour\" to\r\nmeet the future wants of the Church, we may divine of what kind her\r\nfuture wants are to be; and when such men undertake to conquer all\r\nthe forces of impiety, we may expect a social reign of the gospel,\r\nushered in by the zouaves--such a social reign of it as some of the\r\nspiritual princes of the Continent re-established when, after their\r\nSpiritual States had been shaken by the Reformation, Catholic leagues\r\nreinstated the prince-bishops in power. As to England, the _Civiltá_,\r\nat a date subsequent to notices already alluded to, names the Duke of\r\nNorfolk as heading a protest against the occupation of Rome from the\r\nnoblest of the nation; Lord Campden and \"Giorgio Clifford\" as leading a\r\nuniversal subscription of English youth; the ladies as conducting the\r\n\"work\" of Peter's Pence; R. Martin as forming a league of prayer for\r\npersons of all grades; and Warteton (_sic_) as instituting \"the crusade\r\nfor Pius IX, a league of our Lady of Victories entirely composed\r\nof children.\"[483] How many British children are learning in this\r\nmuch-mentioned league by the inspirations of our Lady of Victories, to\r\ncovet their baptism of fire in the projected crusade, we do not know,\r\nnor yet how they are to be taught to select the particular branch\r\nof the \"forces of impiety\" against which their first arms are to be\r\nproved. But, says the _Civiltá_--\r\n\r\n    there will be a struggle, there will be travails, there will be\r\n    sorrows. But the victory is in their [the Catholics'] hands: of\r\n    this the proof more than manifest is found in eighteen centuries\r\n    of continuous combats and victories of Catholicism. As the great\r\n    Matthias, indignant because before his eyes an officer of the king\r\n    dared to burn incense to an idol, rose up crying, \"Let him that is\r\n    true to the law follow me,\" and commenced those grand struggles\r\n    and grand victories of the Maccabees which are known to all, so\r\n    the most fervent Catholics, indignant and horrified at the capture\r\n    of Rome, pointing out the Revolution, in the meetings at Fulda and\r\n    at Malines, at Ghent and at Geneva, as the cause of so much evil,\r\n    as the enemy of Christ and of His Vicar, cried, \"Let all that are\r\n    Catholics at heart rise up and follow us in the fight.\" Their cry\r\n    has been heard, and the general crusade is already begun.[484]\r\n\r\nThe development of the _general crusade_ has been slower than the\r\nseers in their many Maccabean visions saw; but at the end of six years\r\nall the preparations for it are in progress, and the two-fold end is\r\nsteadily kept in view: first, Rome is to receive back the Pope at the\r\npoint of the bayonet; and secondly, the whole world is to accept \"the\r\nsocial reign of the gospel\" at the point of the bayonet too, unless\r\nnations, being timely wise, bow the neck and lick the dust where\r\nmarches the Vicar of God. So man proposes. But since the day in 1850\r\nwhen, as we heard at the beginning, a \"salutary conspiracy and a holy\r\ncrusade\" were formally announced as the two things needful, much that\r\nman astutely planned and firmly proposed has not come to pass according\r\nto man's design, but has been strangely turned to the purposes of a\r\nclearer wisdom, and a kinder will. Even the monument in the cemetery of\r\nSt. Lorenzo to the Crusaders, which exhibits Peter, under the effigy\r\nof Pio Nono, giving the sword to the Christian army, and commanding it\r\nto make a Catholic world, now bears, in addition to its texts from the\r\nMaccabees, a fresh inscription: \"Ransomed Rome leaves to posterity,\r\nas a lasting sign of calamitous times, this monument, erected by the\r\ntheocratic government to foreign mercenaries.\"\r\n\r\nOn the last day of 1870--that year of which the echoes will sound\r\nall down the vale of time, repeating the cry, \"Man proposes but God\r\ndisposes\"--a strange sound was heard in Rome. Floods had brought sorrow\r\ninto the city. Victor Emmanuel left Florence, and at four o'clock in\r\nthe morning of December 31, for the first time, as king in his capital,\r\nset foot in Rome. In its sovereigns the city was familiar with titles\r\nof Saints, of Great, of Holiness, and of Blessedness, and with ancient\r\ntitles noting many a shade of skill and power. But there was a title\r\nwhich was not only unknown, but seemed alien to all the traditions that\r\nhad gathered around the place from the days of Sulla and of Catiline\r\ntill now. As the burly king, amid the frantic joy which had marked his\r\nbrief visit, was about to enter the carriage to return, a little girl\r\napproached with a nosegay of fair flowers, and said: \"Take this, KING\r\nHONEST MAN!\"\r\n\r\nIf with the expiring hours of 1870 the reign of Craft died in Rome, and\r\nthat of Honesty began, it would mark the mightiest of all the modern\r\nrevolutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 476: _Civiltá_, VII. xi. 760.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 477: _Civiltá_, VII. xi. 481-2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 478: _Civiltá_, VII. xi. 559 ff.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 479: _Civiltá_, VIII. i. 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 480: VIII. i. 108.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 481: VIII. i. pp. i. 155-69.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 482: _Civiltá_, VIII. i. 293.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 483: VIII. i. p. 288.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 484: VIII. i. pp. 421-22.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nHow far has the Vatican Movement been a Success, and how far a\r\nFailure?--As to Measures of the Nature of Means a Success--As to\r\nMeasures of the Nature of Ends hitherto a Failure--Testimony of Liberal\r\nCatholics to the one, and of Ultramontanes to the other--Apparatus of\r\nMeans in Operation for the Ultimate End of Universal Dominion--Story\r\nof Scherr as an Example of the Minority--Different Classes of\r\nthose who \"Submit\"--Condition and Prospects of the Two Powers in\r\nItaly--Proximate Ends at present aimed at--Control of Elections--Of the\r\nPress--Of Schools--Problem of France and Italy--Power of the Priests\r\nfor Disturbance--Comparison between Catholic and Non-Catholic Nations\r\nfor last Sixty Years--Are Priests capable of fomenting Anarchical\r\nPlots?--Hopes of Ultramontanes rest on France and England--The Former\r\nfor Military Service, the Latter for Converts--This hope Illusory.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore allowing ourselves to form any opinion on the question how\r\nfar the attempt to place all authorities under the Pontiff has been\r\na failure and how far a success, it is necessary that, in our own\r\nthoughts, two classes of measures should be set well apart. If we look\r\nonly at measures which the leaders of the movement regarded in the\r\nlight of ends, it is easy to pronounce it an utter failure, as most\r\nItalians and many of other nations have done. If, on the other hand,\r\nwe look only at measures which the leaders regarded in the light of\r\nmeans, it is easy to proclaim, as all the voices of the Vatican have\r\nproclaimed, that so far the movement has been a success, wondrous even\r\nto the point of being manifestly divine.\r\n\r\nWe think it impossible to deny the complete success of the Vatican\r\nmovement in perfecting the measures devised as means. Those Liberal\r\nCatholics who at present loudly pronounce the movement a failure, have\r\nonly to read their own writings of 1869 and of the earlier months of\r\n1870, to find that at that time certain advances in the policy of\r\nthe Curia were described as unattainable. Those advances have been\r\naccomplished. As to certain measures, it was said that governments,\r\nbishops, clergy, people, would unite to make them impossible. Those\r\nmeasures are now statutes and ordinances. The Liberal Catholics,\r\nindeed, may pensively say that the gains of the Curia are the losses of\r\nthe Church. That may be. Time will tell. The fact now to be registered\r\nis simply this: Certain changes were declared necessary, and at the\r\nsame time sufficient for the attainment of the great end of universal\r\ndomination. Those changes were pronounced to be revolutionary in the\r\nChurch, dangerous to society, and, in fine, impossible. They were\r\nresisted, were urged on, and were triumphantly carried.\r\n\r\nWe also think it impossible to deny that up to the present time (1876)\r\nthe movement, viewed in relation to ultimate ends, has been a complete\r\nfailure. We do not say as much of proximate ends. As we have used the\r\nwritings of Liberal Catholics to measure the success in regard to\r\nmeans, so would we use the writings of the Court party to measure the\r\nfailure in regard to ends. It is already familiar to us that in those\r\nwritings the moral renovations which were to attend the dawn of the new\r\nera, could not be indicated by any metaphor short of the primal burst\r\nof light on the horror of chaos. It was to be! So soon as the Lord\r\nshould manifestly set His king upon His holy hill of Sion, all kings\r\nwere to fall down before him, and his enemies were to lick the dust.\r\nParliaments were to recognize their impotence and expire. Populations,\r\nsuddenly illuminated, were to behold the saviour of society, and were\r\nlovingly to bow to his law. As to any possible opposition, it was\r\ndescribed as the heathen raging--as the people imagining a vain thing.\r\nIt was only the kings of the earth setting themselves and the rulers\r\ntaking counsel together against the Lord and against His anointed.\r\n\r\nNow, in fulfilment of these promises, what has come to pass? The Pope\r\nhas fallen from his temporal throne. A long and bloody war, carried on\r\nwith a view to place Don Carlos on the throne of Spain, has failed.\r\nContrary to the fairest promise, hopes of placing the Count of Chambord\r\non the throne of France have faded away. The tentative federation of\r\nGermany has been consolidated by an imperial crown, hereditary in the\r\nreigning house of Prussia. Austria has persisted in her anti-Catholic\r\nlegislation, as it was called, and has extended it by abrogating the\r\nConcordat. Switzerland and Germany have both returned the attacks of\r\nthe ecclesiastical power upon the civil power, by laws reasserting\r\nthe national supremacy in every sphere of public life. Italy, in the\r\nact of overturning the temporal power, has completed her own unity.\r\nIn the act of completing her own unity, she has, in the city of Rome,\r\nviolated what the Pope calls Catholic unity, by admitting religious\r\nliberty within the sacred walls. In America no great State has modified\r\nits law in favour of the new theocracy. Several of the Catholic States\r\nhave shown a consciousness of its aims, and jealousy of its accredited\r\nagents. In Canada, leading Liberal statesmen have clearly evinced a\r\nrising consciousness of what the Papacy is, and of what it aims at. The\r\none ideal ruler of the Curia, the one set before the youth of nations\r\nas their model, Garcia Moreno, President of Ecuador, has fallen, openly\r\nassassinated in broad daylight. Thus, at the time when, according to\r\nhis seers, the Pontiff was to survey a new cosmos rising out of the\r\nchaos of the Modern State, he, all round the horizon, beholds only\r\nconfusion worse confounded. Not one nation has submitted its code\r\nto his revision. Not in one kingdom of the earth has a ruler been\r\ninstalled to reign under the laws of the Syllabus.\r\n\r\nDoes not this statement concede all that is claimed by those who say\r\nthat the movement is a failure not redeemed by one success? What it\r\ndoes really concede is, that of the two ways, in one of which the\r\nends aimed at were to be accomplished, the first has disappointed all\r\nhope. The ends proposed were so grand that only in one of two ways\r\ncould they be realized; and whatever may be said of the enthusiasm of\r\nthe projectors, it is not to be denied that they never lost sight of\r\nthis fact, and never concealed it. The two ways were either such an\r\nintervention of Providence as would amount to a cosmopolitan miracle,\r\nor else the slow operation of means extending over ages. While the\r\nPope and his more superstitious followers seemed to expect that the\r\nVirgin and the new-made saints would obtain miraculous transformations,\r\nthe more calculating, even at moments when the flow of money and of\r\nfriends seemed not only to exhilarate the Vatican, but to intoxicate\r\nit, did not fail to keep in view the fact that centuries might\r\nintervene--centuries marked by many a partial success and many a\r\ntemporary discomfiture--between the day when the perfected machinery of\r\nmeans should be set in motion, and the day when the crowning victory\r\nshould lead the head of the human species in triumph to the goal. The\r\nJesuits are now entitled to point to that fact in bar of any premature\r\nexultation over their disappointment. At the same time, with all their\r\npower of simulating the joy of victory in defeat, they have been unable\r\nto prevent chagrin from tinging much of their later language. The\r\ngreat spectacle did not operate as a charm. The sublime revelation of\r\na central authority for all human affairs did not subdue any wayward\r\ninstitutions. Providence put no seal on the deeds done. The replacing\r\nof St. Michael in his office of patron of the Church, was symptomatic\r\nof considerable dissatisfaction with the departmental divinities in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this complete failure of supernatural aid, or of\r\nany favouring current in public events, does not alter the fact that\r\na system of means, contemplated and desired for ages, has at last\r\nbeen perfected, and that it is now over all the world being gradually\r\nbrought into operation. The magnitude of the means indicates the\r\nuniversality of the ends. The fact that centuries upon centuries have\r\nelapsed since Popes began to claim what Pius IX has now acquired,\r\nthat more than three centuries have passed even since, at Trent, the\r\nJesuit General set up the pretensions which have now, at last, become\r\nthe law of one hundred and seventy millions, is a consideration not\r\nlightly to be set aside, particularly when we contemplate the strife\r\nfor universal dominion now openly inaugurated as a continuing struggle,\r\nto be handed down from generation to generation of men trained and\r\nconsecrated to this very thing.\r\n\r\nThe stupendous scope of the ends might well demand as means measures\r\nexceptionally great, and the magnitude of the measures already carried\r\nas means may now well excuse, if not justify, confidence that the\r\nends after they shall have been steadily pursued for ages will also\r\nbe attained. Those ends were not less, when united into one, than the\r\ndominion of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Internal Tribunal, seated in every church, in every palace, in\r\nevery castle, and at need in every private chamber, would always in\r\npoint of authority take precedence of any local law, and would rule\r\nbed, board, purse, family, and all action which conscience determines.\r\n\r\nThe External Tribunal, seated in every city, would maintain the\r\nheadship of the bishop over the civil magistrate, and the supremacy\r\nof spiritual over civil law and authority, as sacredly as we should\r\nmaintain the supremacy of our civil law and authority over military law\r\nand authority.\r\n\r\nThe External Tribunal would make the Internal an establishment of the\r\nlaw. Every man, every woman, ay, every child of a certain age, who\r\nshould not appear at least once in the year in that tribunal, would run\r\ninto a punishable offence.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Tribunal in the person of the Pope, acting either directly\r\nor through any Court or Congregation he might appoint, would be the\r\nfinal bar at which would appear contending kings, contending nations,\r\nor other appellants whatever, as also all whom he might, for any cause,\r\nbe pleased to cite. From that judgment-seat would fall the sentence\r\nthat only the Almighty could challenge. According to the well-known\r\nformula, the Supreme Judge would carry all rights in the shrine of his\r\nown breast.\r\n\r\nSuch a universal dominion was the end, the ultimate end in view. The\r\nend was hallowed to the mind of those proposing it by the persuasion\r\nthat this dominion of the priest of God is the veritable kingdom of\r\nChrist. It is only by realizing how conscientious is this view of the\r\nspiritual empire, or the Roman Empire in a spiritual form--a view\r\nwhich, founded on a historic ideal, fascinates the imagination of\r\nRomanists--that we can either be just and charitable to the men who\r\nmove for these ends, or can arrive at any reasonable estimate of the\r\namount of future force in their movement. Mere politicians, say some,\r\nwho have no religious feeling! Yes, many such; but these politicians\r\nwell know that their power is proportioned to the amount of religious\r\nfeeling which they can create and make ready to be acted upon. It is\r\nby putting together the political skill of the one set of men and the\r\nreligious feeling of the other, that we obtain means of judging as to\r\nthe quality of the directing and the amount of the impelling forces to\r\nbe developed in the future struggle.\r\n\r\nAfter all that they have recently accomplished within the Church,\r\nwhat can be too hard, they ask, to accomplish outside? They wanted\r\nto make the entire Church an instrument in which every joint, to the\r\nremotest limb, should infallibly respond to the will of the central\r\ndirector, so that at any given moment, and on any one point, the whole\r\nof its force could be brought to bear wherever resistance might be\r\nencountered, or wherever an advance might promise success. To make it\r\nsuch an instrument required changes which were pronounced unattainable,\r\nbut they laughed the discouragement to scorn. Those changes affected\r\nall the three spheres of organization, constitution, and dogma. In\r\n_organization_ every clergyman had to be made movable at the will of\r\nthe bishop, and every bishop had to be made dependent on the will of\r\nthe Pope. The franchises of both the parish and the diocese had to be\r\nrevoked. It is done. But it could not be done without a constitutional\r\nchange. In the _constitution_ the Bishop of Rome had to be made by law\r\nthe Ordinary of every diocese in the world, and every other bishop\r\nin the world had to be made by law a mere surrogate of the Bishop of\r\nRome. That one bishop had to be made by law the sole lawgiver even\r\nwhen the entire episcopate meets in a General Council, and the whole\r\nepiscopate in General Council assembled had to be by law reduced from a\r\nco-ordinate branch of a legislature to what is, in effect, a mere privy\r\ncouncil to the Bishop of Rome. It is all done. But it could not be done\r\nwithout a dogmatic change. In _dogma_ it had to be determined that the\r\nedicts of the Bishop of Rome embodied in themselves all the alleged\r\ninfallibility of the Church; ay, and even the consent of the Church, as\r\na necessary sanction, had to be in dogma disavowed. We blame not any\r\nLiberal Catholic who said that these things were impossible. But the\r\nimpossible is done. The new organization is not a mere administrative\r\nchange, but rests firmly on a new legislative constitution. The new\r\nconstitution is not a mere legislative change liable to legislative\r\nrevision--it rests irreformable on adamantine dogma.\r\n\r\nThus, then, are the hundred and seventy millions, or two hundred\r\nmillions, as they are called, bound into one very compact bundle, to\r\nbe thrown into this scale or that by a single hand. Within the Church,\r\nsays Vitelleschi, resistance is impossible. No obstruction can now\r\narrest the current of command from Pope to nuncio, from nuncio to\r\nbishop and regulars, from bishop to canons and parish priests, from\r\nregulars to all manner of confraternities, from parish priests to\r\nunions and to voters. Where governments have one officer the Church\r\nhas many. Where the government officer has no time to shape public\r\nopinion, the Church officer has little else to do. Where the lackeys in\r\ngovernment service wear fine liveries, and the lords walk about like\r\nour fellow-creatures, the lackeys of the Church have fine liveries too,\r\nbut the lords outshine even the theatre. Where, in Catholic countries,\r\nthe officer of government comes into his seat of authority, or returns\r\ninto it quietly, care is taken that the bishop shall, at his coming,\r\nappear exalted above all principality and power. In proportion as\r\nStates, becoming more Christianized, have risen above show, the Papal\r\nChurch, becoming more paganized and materialized, has sunk deeper into\r\nthe craft and the love of display. While the officers of government\r\nsee that the young are taught the material processes necessary to\r\nfuture power, the officers of the Church see that they are taught\r\nfor what ends it will be good, noble, and martyr-like to employ power\r\nwhen they shall take their future share in governing the world. Bishop\r\nReinkens, in a little work that ought to be read by every man who\r\nmeans to understand the questions that are to come up--_Revolution und\r\nKirche_--declares that the policy of the Papacy is now revolution.\r\nCertain it is that for effecting a world-wide revolution, never did\r\ninstrument exist so generally outspread and so perfectly centralized,\r\nso elaborately ramified and yet so pliant, as will be the society ruled\r\nover at the Vatican when once all the old men who resisted the changes\r\nhave died off, and the new generation instructed in the spirit of the\r\nSyllabus has slowly grown up, as the generations formed by Trent grew\r\nup wherever the canons of that Council were received.\r\n\r\nSuch a growth is too slow to be waited for before partial results are\r\nsecured; and every partial result it is hoped will be a stepping-stone\r\ntowards the complete one. Therefore is every agency already named\r\nemployed in promoting the organization of forces to bear a part in the\r\ngrand struggle when it comes; but meantime in every local struggle.\r\nAssociations of children, associations of peasants, associations of\r\nartizans, associations of old soldiers, called veteran associations,\r\nand numerous associations besides, are formed in various countries\r\nand on several models. On the social side clubs and \"circles\"\r\ncontribute the convivial element, and on the devotional side orders\r\nand confraternities contribute the ascetic element to the common\r\norganization. New \"devotions,\" new visions, new places of pilgrimage,\r\nnew images, new prayers, new relics, new charms, new waters of virtue,\r\nnew shrines, new patrons, new miracles, and new wonders feed the flame.\r\nBy tens of thousands, and by hundreds of thousands, men take an oath\r\nof obedience to the Pope. By tens of thousands volunteers pledged to\r\nshed their blood for him are enrolled--\"On paper,\" say the Italians,\r\nmocking; but 1867 showed that the crusaders meant crusading; and if\r\ntens of thousands of such volunteers under leaders such as Charette\r\nare enrolled they are not to be laughed at. The schools have not been\r\nin operation during the last ten years for nothing. Associations\r\nin France bear the portentous names of Jesu-Workman and Jesu-King\r\n(_Jésu-Ouvrier_ and _Jésu-Roi_)--the one aiming at organizing workmen,\r\nthe other at organizing courts. The name of Jésu set up on these\r\nassociations clearly points to the central organizing Company which\r\nLiberal Catholics with reverent indignation charge with daring to give\r\na double meaning even to the all-blessed Name, not excepting its use in\r\nthe solemn words, \"At the name of Jesus every knee shall bow.\"\r\n\r\nEven after July 18 the Liberal Catholics did not give up the Church\r\nas irrevocably sunk into the hands of the Jesuits. They counted on\r\nthe eighty-eight bishops who had voted Nay, and on their promise one\r\nto another not to act separately. Had that promise been kept, it was\r\njust possible that, under favouring circumstances, the fatal steps of\r\nJuly might have been modified or even recalled, for by all tradition\r\nthe acts of any Council were supposed to remain within its power,\r\nand to be open to its revision till it was legally dissolved. The\r\nCuria put this tradition under its heel. It posted up the Decrees on\r\nthe doors of the Lateran and in other public places in the city, and\r\ncertified the whole world that by this act they had become its supreme\r\nand irreformable law. How did the eighty-eight deport themselves?\r\nThey had tamely allowed all manner of revolutionary acts, when done\r\nfrom above, and they allowed this last one as tamely as the rest. The\r\nerring Peter of the Vatican was not at the head of a community capable\r\nof producing a man who could withstand him to the face, and could\r\ntell him, as one told the erring Peter of Antioch, that he was to be\r\nblamed. Indeed, logically, the bishops seemed to have no ground of\r\nobjection. The Decrees did not profess to be those of a Council, but\r\nthose of the Pope, a Council having approved of them. If, then, the\r\nPope by promulging any doctrinal Bull without citing the approbation\r\nof a Council, could give to it the force of irreformable law, unless\r\nit should be rejected by the bishops, how much more was he entitled\r\nto give that force to these Decrees. Even had their tenets afforded\r\nthem ground for resistance, the eighty-eight were not the men to avail\r\nthemselves of it. From one we may learn the complexion of them all.\r\n\r\nAt midnight on July 19, Von Scherr, Archbishop of Munich, who had\r\nthroughout the Council acted with the Opposition, re-entered his\r\ncity. He came, as the Germans say, without song or chime--that is, in\r\nstrict privacy. At first many thought--and Friedrich was one of the\r\nnumber--that this demeanour was adopted, on the part of his Grace,\r\nto shun any public demonstration which the people might have made in\r\nhonour of his attitude in Rome. But the whisper soon crept round,\r\n\"Gregory has submitted.\"\r\n\r\nPresently the Faculty of Theology, with Döllinger at its head, came in\r\nall form to present the Archbishop with an address of congratulation\r\non his happy return. After the formal reply to the address, his Grace\r\nsaid, \"Rome has spoken: you gentlemen know the rest. We could do\r\nnothing but give in.\" Friedrich says that he saw how Döllinger was\r\nboiling, while the rest were also moved. \"We struggled long,\" continued\r\nthe Archbishop, \"and gained much, and we also averted a deal of evil.\"\r\nThis remark, says Friedrich, evidently encountered general incredulity.\r\nThe Archbishop then told of the deputation to the Pope--of which he was\r\na member--on July 15; of the hopes raised by the reply it received; of\r\nhow those hopes were dashed by the influence of Senestrey--for he does\r\nnot seem to have named Manning; and finally, of the sad disappointment\r\nof Cardinal Rauscher on going the next day to thank his Holiness for\r\nyielding, and on hearing from those lips which to the \"Catholic\"\r\nworld are the fount of truth, that the formula which, on the previous\r\nevening, the Pope denied having seen, was actually distributed among\r\nthe prelates, and was declared to be irrevocable.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the conversation, Scherr, turning to Döllinger, said,\r\n\"Shall we start afresh to work for the Holy Church?\" The aged _Probst_\r\nreplied, \"Yes, for the OLD one.\" It was evident that, if Scherr had\r\njust then had any other man before him, his anger would have waxed\r\nhot. He suppressed it, however, and replied, \"There is only one Church,\r\nnot a new one and an old.\" Then were the words pronounced by Döllinger,\r\n\"They have MADE a new one.\" The note was sounded. The Archbishop could\r\nonly say, \"There have always been alterations in the Church and in the\r\ndoctrines.\" This speech played upon the countenances of the Professors,\r\ncalling up in each case a look characteristic of the man. \"Never shall\r\nI forget,\" says Friedrich, \"the respective bearing of Döllinger and\r\nHaneberg.\" Döllinger was soon excommunicated; Haneberg was soon in a\r\nbishop's palace, but ere long he died. No one took up the conversation,\r\nand as the Archbishop turned from Döllinger to address some one else,\r\nFriedrich saw tears in his eyes.\r\n\r\nIn the hall of the university where the Professors had robed, and where\r\nthey now unrobed, they spent a quarter of an hour in talking over\r\nthe scene. Döllinger, however, did not stay. Rather early the next\r\nmorning, the Archbishop deigned to visit the plain house in Von der\r\nTann Street. Döllinger plainly told him that he could not receive the\r\ndogma of July 18, being, as it was, in open contradiction to the past\r\nteaching and history of the Church. In that dogma the worst thing of\r\nall was the addition made after the discussion, \"not by the consent of\r\nthe Church.\" Here was a surprise for the Archbishop. He knew nothing of\r\nthat addition. He had left the field before the last gun was fired. He\r\nhad now to learn the shape which his new faith had actually taken, and\r\nto learn it from the lips of Döllinger. The venerable Provost who was\r\nto be excommunicated had to tell the Archbishop who was to do the deed\r\nwhat the change of creed actually was for not conforming to which he\r\nwas to be given over to Satan. That scene might have afforded Kaulbach\r\nanother picture.\r\n\r\nVon Scherr at first spoke in Munich of the promise made by the bishops\r\nof the minority to one another not to act separately. By the end of\r\nAugust he had forgotten all about it. A \"highly placed\" layman was\r\ninformed by the Archbishop that he need not trouble himself with\r\ninfallibility, as the Decree would not be promulged in the diocese,\r\nand what was not promulged was not binding. Almost immediately\r\nafterwards it was printed in his own paper. Ere long, Scherr was as\r\nhot for infallibility as if his object had been to make the Curia\r\nforget in his present zeal any unpleasant impressions made by his\r\nformer opposition. He was exemplary in protesting, threatening, and\r\nexcommunicating. Friedrich gives particulars to prove, in the case of\r\nScherr, that disregard of truth which is so freely alleged against the\r\nbishops generally, into which we will not enter.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, from one of the minority we may judge of all. Neither\r\nHefele nor Kenrick, neither Dupanloup nor Strossmayer, displayed any\r\nChristian fortitude sufficient to arrest their Church in her downward\r\ncourse, or indeed displayed anything to give the Curia aught but food\r\nfor scorn of the Opposition. Their convictions had been solemnly stated\r\nand ably argued. Those convictions did suffice to cause hesitation.\r\nBut the force of conviction only tested the force of habit, and did\r\nnot break it. The new submission made them tenfold more than ever the\r\ncreatures of that overweening power which they had spent their lives\r\nin exalting, which for a moment they had attempted to moderate, but to\r\nwhich they now succumbed in its most heinous assumptions.\r\n\r\nThe lower clergy have followed the bishops in submission. At one time\r\nit seemed as if many of them would withstand. Except, however, in the\r\ntwo countries nearest to Italy--Switzerland and Germany--no appreciable\r\nresistance has been offered. In Germany the men in whom the force of\r\nbelief overcame the habit of submission were almost exclusively those\r\nwhom the elevating influence of university life had lifted above the\r\nordinary level of the clergy. Their number is not large; but the\r\nvaluable writings which they have already produced show that they\r\nhave no mean power of influencing the future currents of theological\r\nthought. Spirited France, in spite of its Gallican traditions, was a\r\npattern of tameness. The striking examples of Loyson and Michaud found\r\nexceedingly few to follow. Gratry \"submitted.\" Throughout the rest of\r\nthe world the exceptions have been isolated and without influence.\r\n\r\nAmong the laity, again, it is only in Switzerland and Germany that\r\nsuccess has been even chequered. The otherwise uniform submission has\r\nthere been broken by numbers considerable to-day, but more considerable\r\nfor the future. Yet compared with the mass in submission, those numbers\r\nare soon told. But, on the other hand, that mass in submission is not\r\nof uniform value to the future theocracy. It contains the cordial\r\nadherents who already believed; the dutiful adherents who doubted, but\r\nat the word of the Council said, It is decided, and I now, as in duty\r\nbound, believe; the reckless adherents, who, like most in Italy and\r\nmany in France, would as cheerfully have submitted to a dogma declaring\r\nthe Popes imponderable, as to one declaring them infallible, and who do\r\nreally believe that they are irreformable. Differing from all these are\r\nmen who had an intelligent conviction against the new dogma, or against\r\nthe new constitution, or against both. These, brought face to face with\r\nthe alternative--submit, or bear the curse of the Church; submit, or\r\nsurvive the rending in twain of every life-tie--did sadly and slowly\r\nsubmit--submit without attempting to reconcile things to their reason,\r\nas it is said that Montalembert declared he would do. These men may\r\nnever make apt instruments of the priests, but they do make their\r\nproud trophies. One strong man silently submitting is a statuesque\r\nmonition to many others not to think. A still further element of\r\nunknown extent mingles with the mass. It consists of those who,\r\nwithout either formal submission or open breach, do not believe the\r\nnew dogma, and do not approve of the new constitution. This now inert\r\nbulk may turn to a force bearing in either direction, or may divide\r\ninto two portions; one giving the priests control over profession and\r\nappearance, without any corresponding control over belief--which is,\r\nperhaps, of all their triumphs the most practical; and another in which\r\nconviction, growing at last too strong for the habit of submission,\r\nbreaks by its divine force the human bond, and throws men upon their\r\nconscience, their Bible, and their God. But when men have once really\r\nbelieved in a God who leaves the rule over His redeemed offspring\r\nto a Vicar, and have believed in man as a creature whose conscience\r\nanother man is to keep, it is hard to find in them foothold for solid\r\nChristian convictions. They are kneaded to the hand of the priest.\r\nIf they leave him, they become infidels, who though in feeling his\r\nopponents, perhaps his persecutors, become in argument and action his\r\npractical allies. Joining him in rooting out faith in the Bible and in\r\nprimitive Christianity, they urge men to his two extremes of doctrine,\r\nthe authority of the Church or Atheism, and consequently to his two\r\nextremes of government, the Papacy or the International. One Auguste\r\nComte is worth many a monastery.\r\n\r\nIt is this \"sublime\" spectacle of success with hierarchy, clergy, and\r\nlaity, which makes the recent past, to the augurs of reconstruction,\r\na certain presage of a triumph, perhaps distant, but complete, in\r\nthe future. No recalcitrating bishop now; or if a few worn-out men\r\nare still secretly of the old inclining, they are rapidly dying off.\r\nThe list of the eighty-eight is already a short one. No bishop is\r\nnow installed who to the old oath which already made him a vassal of\r\nthe Pope does not add the new articles of the Vatican Decrees. No\r\nseminaries are now training priests to deny the infallibility of the\r\nPope, or his ordinary, immediate, and omnipresent authority. In most\r\nthe Jesuit text-books are adopted. No catechisms are now teaching\r\nagainst Papal infallibility, or teaching ambiguously. The new doctrine\r\nwill be couched in terms clearer or less clear, according to political\r\nand theological necessities; but, whether in Prague or Sydney, in\r\nFlorence or Liverpool, in Boston or Warsaw, in Berlin or Lima, the\r\ncatechism will contain a text from which the friar or priest will put\r\nthe same principles of social reconstruction into the minds of boys and\r\ngirls. To the view of the Jesuits, the future unfolds like a peacock's\r\ntail, all sparkling with the eyes of the young. The outward loss to\r\nthe Church which has been sustained was reckoned upon before hand.\r\nThey hold that it is more than compensated by the perfect internal\r\ncompactness gained. When once the preparations are complete--and a few\r\nscore years are of no account--a generation well trained will be ready\r\nat the call of him who holds among men the place of God, to take up the\r\ncross of St. Peter, to cry, \"God wills it,\" and to march till all high\r\nthings that exalt themselves against Christ shall be pulled down, and\r\nthe Church alone shall stand, the one all-perfect society embracing the\r\nhuman species.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the temporal power affected all the calculations of the\r\nforegoing period. It came with appalling suddenness. It startled all\r\nmen to see the Emperor who had been the sole prop of the temporal\r\npower fall, not like a prince put to the worst amid a loyal people,\r\nbut with an unheard-of crash like a log upon ice, while his empire\r\ninstantly went under; and to see in another moment the Italian sentries\r\nstanding round the Vatican. All efforts had first to be turned to a\r\nrestoration. As if to illustrate the weakness which the subjects of the\r\nPope form for any State, while yet the war was raging King William had\r\nto negotiate with Ledochowsky,[485] and ere yet the blood was dry, a\r\npetition signed by fifty-six members of the Prussian Parliament prayed\r\nthe new Emperor of Germany to restore the Pope--which meant to declare\r\nwar on Italy. While the Emperor still lay at Versailles a deputation,\r\nheaded by three counts, passed through bleeding France to pray the\r\nvictor to flesh his sword anew. Emperor William well knew that if all\r\nthe powers of the Papacy sufficed for the task, the new empire would\r\nbe rent to shivers in a day. The army which had taken Paris did not\r\nmarch on Rome. France had next to exhibit herself as a suppliant at\r\nthe feet of the Holy Father--a Holy Father who wanted her with her\r\nright arm broken to draw with her left and cut down the Italians. She\r\nmet this wicked suggestion with humble requests that the Holy Father\r\nwould show forbearance and not demand services for which she was not\r\nprepared. Incredible as it may seem, Father Hyacinth Loyson stated, in\r\nthe _Journal des Débats_, that French bishops, before thus attempting\r\nto entangle their own government, had actually applied to the invading\r\nGermans.[486] Refused by the invader, refused by their country, they\r\nhated where they could not smite. Germany was marked for destruction;\r\nand France was held to future service when the time should come.\r\nMeantime, every effort was put forth to check and disunite Italy, but\r\nin vain. She has strained the religious toleration which the Pope\r\nabhors so as even to cover overt political hostilities. She has allowed\r\nhim to issue all manner of incentives to undo the Italian kingdom by\r\neither domestic revolt or foreign intervention, or if possible by both.\r\nShe has allowed him to gather together crowds of hostile foreigners and\r\nto excite them to affront and revile the nation. She has grown stronger\r\nand more solid during the process, laughing equally at the Napoleonic\r\nidea that the Pope was to be treated as if he had two hundred thousand\r\nbayonets, and at the Bonaparte violence which inflicted personal\r\ninsult, prison, and exile. At this moment, after six years have passed,\r\nthe Vatican as unblushingly asserts that Italy--the real Italy--is\r\non its side as it did in the years preceding Solferino.[487] Victor\r\nEmmanuel has tried the experiment of letting the Pope play the prisoner\r\nor the freeman, the prophet, priest, or Caesar, the tribune or the\r\nmedicine-man, just at his wayward will. The enmity of the Pope has been\r\ngood for Italy as for England, Germany, America, and all countries\r\nfavoured with it; but if the day comes when the Pope meets the bow of\r\nany future Prime Minister of Italy with a responsive bow, then may we\r\nbegin to look for fresh cycles of conspiracy and convulsion.\r\n\r\nThe future must be its own interpreter. Meantime in the Vatican sits\r\na king calling himself a prisoner, though he is free to go where he\r\nwill; and in the Quirinal, a king calling himself a good Catholic,\r\nthough he is a rebel against the Vicar of God. If the wisdom of Italy\r\nin allowing to the Pope unlimited personal freedom has been great, the\r\nwant of wisdom in professing to exalt his spiritual authority, and in\r\ngiving in to his sole hand the ancient powers of both the crown and\r\nthe people in the election of bishops and clergy, amounts perhaps to\r\nthe grossest political folly of our age. When Bonaparte dealt with the\r\nPope as sole arbiter of the bishoprics of France, he opened a mine\r\nagainst the national authority whether seated on a throne or on a\r\npresident's chair, over which it has never sat securely, and in which\r\nit will one day sink if France goes on as she has done of late, giving\r\nthe priests increasing power in education. But when Victor Emmanuel\r\nrepeats this blunder in a form more completely providing for future\r\nPapal power, he digs a grave under the feet of his own dynasty. To\r\nItalians, unhappily, a great hypocrisy may be a great triumph of skill;\r\nthey smile at principles, admire shifts, and are wondrously clever at\r\nthem. In politics, till they found the principle of constitutional\r\nmonarchy, they, in spite of all their shifts, floundered between\r\nfruitless conspiracy and repression--never ending, still beginning. In\r\nreligion they want what in politics they have found, a principle and a\r\nbasis. Ancient scriptural Christianity, the Christianity of the Epistle\r\nto the Romans, would give them the firm rock between the quicksands of\r\nsacerdotalism and the floods of infidelity; a rock on which a nation\r\nmight securely rise to take its place with realms which own no other\r\nfoundation. But hitherto scarcely a glimmer of light on this matter has\r\nappeared among Italian statesmen. They sadly underrate the power of the\r\nCuria. The Curia know their weakness, and count upon their fall. To\r\nbring it to pass may, they think, take time; but the Pope well knows\r\nhow to play upon the king for the undoing of the nation. Any ruler who\r\ndoes not in his conscience believe the Pope to be a pretender in his\r\nclaims to represent God and to rule the universal Church, and who does\r\nnot believe him to be the worst and greatest corrupter of the Christian\r\nreligion ever brought to light by time, is in constant danger of\r\nrisking all by some act of compliance induced perhaps by his religious\r\nsentiments, by the remorse of his vices, by the intrigues of the women\r\nabout him, or by the guile of the ecclesiastics who lie in wait.\r\n\r\nFor the time being the Vatican is placed at the disadvantage of\r\ncomplicating the general struggle for supremacy with the particular\r\none for the restoration of the temporal power. The ultimate end being\r\nnow manifestly distant, the whole power of the perfected mechanism is\r\nturned to the gaining in detail of the proximate ends which will lead\r\nto it. These, roughly stated, are, control over elections, control over\r\nthe Press, and control over schools. If we take Bavaria and Belgium as\r\nfavourable specimens of Roman Catholic countries, the priestly power in\r\nelections has already become a source of bloodshed, and threatens to be\r\nso in continuance. The Catholic and the Liberal parties stand arrayed\r\nas two forces, not representing, like our Conservatives and Liberals,\r\ntwo tendencies necessary to balance one another, but two hostile\r\nprinciples one or other of which must perish. In Germany the power of\r\nthe Pope in elections has proved to be a real not to say a terrible\r\none. In France it was found such at the first election after the war as\r\nto be all but sufficient to place the destinies of the country at his\r\ndisposal for a time. The last general election showed a decided recoil\r\nfrom this danger. In Italy it had come to that point that in municipal\r\nelections the moderate party, in several instances, made common cause\r\nwith the Papal one. But there, again, the last general election has\r\ngiven a result in the opposite direction. The terror which the priests\r\ncan turn to account in elections is threefold--dread of civil hurt or\r\nloss, for which contrivances are manifold; dread of personal violence,\r\nwhich of course supposes a strong Catholic party; and dread of eternal\r\nruin, which the priest of God can inflict for voting against the\r\ninterests of the Church. Even on Roman Catholics not brought up in\r\nthe schools of priests, these influences are powerful. What will they\r\nbecome with generations brought up in schools under the new inspiration\r\nof the Syllabus?\r\n\r\n\"In every mode and by every means that is not contrary to our\r\nconscience\" is the formula expressing the solemn pledges of all\r\nCatholics to war against the revolution, or the Modern State. Not\r\nmerely as to the occupation of Rome, but in its very principles, says\r\nthe _Civiltá_, will we oppose it--\r\n\r\n    We shall fight it with Catholic associations, we shall fight it\r\n    with the Press, we shall fight it in parliament. We shall confront\r\n    theory with theory, morality with morality, school with school, the\r\n    flag of Christ with the flag of Satan, raised by the revolution.\r\n    Catholic societies where they existed are being multiplied, where\r\n    they did not exist they are being planted. The number of Catholic\r\n    members in the Prussian Parliament has increased beyond hope, and\r\n    in Belgium they have drawn closer together. The struggle against\r\n    the Austrian ministry which favoured the revolution has grown\r\n    hotter, and _obligations in defence of Catholic principles will\r\n    be imposed upon the future Members of Parliament of England and\r\n    Ireland_. With whom will be the final victory?--there can be no\r\n    doubt.[488]\r\n\r\nAs to the Press, the \"work of the 'good Press'\" is one of the most\r\nmeritorious of the many \"works\" in operation for the new celestial\r\nempire. From the great _Civiltá_, the mainspring of the whole, to\r\nthe episcopal organ in the remotest diocese, it moves for one end,\r\nwhether in the form of review, magazine, journal, pamphlet, or book.\r\nIt represents a literature really prodigious, and is in its own eyes\r\non the high road to supremacy. Of journals it is said that in Germany\r\nalone hundreds are subsidized.[489] How far the assertions are true or\r\nfalse we know not, which are frequently made, that the most rabid and\r\nblaspheming organs of low and anarchical demagogues are in Jesuit pay;\r\nbut those assertions in themselves are a serious symptom. In Italy it\r\nis often popularly said that there are one hundred and eighty thousand\r\nnuns, friars, and priests, all counted. In France of priests alone\r\nthere are forty thousand. In Germany, as Schulte has shown, in certain\r\ncities the ecclesiastical persons, male and female, number from ten\r\nper cent. upwards of the _adult_ population. If we extend to the whole\r\nRoman Catholic population of the world calculations of an organization\r\non a scale somewhat similar, we cannot do otherwise than regard a Press\r\nwhich controls such a cosmopolitan force as a serious power.\r\n\r\nAt the same time a twofold weakness of the \"_good Press_\" is obvious.\r\nFirst, it does not carry with it the Press which really leads nations,\r\nthough it runs strong in by-channels of its own. And, again, it tends\r\nto change the ignorance of the general Press into knowledge. In Germany\r\nthis is already done. There the pious and mystic style of the Vatican\r\ndialect has ceased to be an unknown tongue. Men of letters and jurists\r\nwho twenty years ago would have passed over the ecclesiastico-political\r\nphrases of a bishop or cardinal as unwittingly as an English Member of\r\nParliament, now read them with luminous and searching insight. Even\r\nin England and America a process of self-instruction is rapidly going\r\non in the best journals. Lord Beaconsfield, in _Lothair_, has shown\r\nthat he is awake to the social and scenic aspects of the Ultramontane\r\nmovement, and has displayed more insight into the genealogy of its\r\ncult than have the men in this nation to whom the country has a right\r\nto look for something better than slipshod arguments, and well-played\r\nparodies. Mr. Gladstone has shown himself awake to the national and\r\ninternational, to the moral and political aspects of Ultramontanism.\r\nMr. Cartwright's work on the Jesuits shows that younger politicians\r\nare beginning to do the best thing they can do, that is, to study at\r\noriginal sources, and to give solid information. Mr. T.A. Trollope's\r\nwork on Papal Conclaves shows that all Englishmen are not able in Rome\r\nto resist the rational tendency to see the place with unveiled eyes,\r\nand to speak of it and its ways in plain English, and that some of\r\nthose who thoroughly know it are not disposed to enhance the reputation\r\nwhich the English of late years have been earning for love of monkish\r\nfinery and open-mouthed credence of monkish fables. Perhaps in time\r\nsome ecclesiastic of a rank, in the religious world, corresponding to\r\nthat of Lord Beaconsfield and Mr. Gladstone in the political world,\r\nmay show some grasp of the subject. The relation of our jurists to\r\nthe movement is hardly so close as to warrant the hope that they will\r\nbe led to such a study of it as is now manifest among the jurists of\r\nGermany. Yet no result is so much to be desired. In fact the whole\r\nquestion belongs much more to the jurist and the politician than to\r\nthe theologian; although theological ideas are throughout employed as\r\nthe motive power.\r\n\r\nDesirable as is the control of elections and of the Press, still\r\nmore desirable is that of universities, colleges, and schools, for\r\nthey now bear within their bosoms the electors and lawgivers, the\r\nwriters and readers who will hereafter mould statutes and determine\r\nthe temper of armies as well as their destination. The establishment\r\nthroughout Europe of universities canonically instituted was, at the\r\ncommencement of its career, pointed out by the _Civiltá_ as a leading\r\nobject in the movement it projected. When we trace with Ranke the Papal\r\nrestoration which in part repaired the great revolt of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, we find that the greatest results of that movement were not\r\nwon till after a generation or two had passed away. It was only south\r\nof the Pyrenees and the Alps that the arms of Charles V and Philip II\r\neffectually stayed the Reformation. In central Europe and in France\r\nthe Bible, the school, and the Reformed Churches continued to spread\r\nlong after the Council of Trent. When the two princely youths Ferdinand\r\nof Austria and Maximilian of Bavaria were still imbibing the Jesuit\r\nlessons of Ingolstadt, the memory of Alva had long been execrated in\r\nthe Low Countries, and the songs of England had long thanked God for\r\nthe overthrow of the Armada. At the same time imperial cities on the\r\nDanube, and castles in Austria, Styria, and Bohemia, were becoming\r\nmore and more centres of the Reformed doctrine. The decisive check\r\nto the spread of that doctrine was not given till education had\r\ndone its work. Education did not supply the check otherwise than by\r\nensuring the command of the sword. The schoolmaster made the Thirty\r\nYears' War. It was the teaching of Ingolstadt that trained Ferdinand\r\nto the cool, conscientious, adroit, and unrelenting use of physical\r\nforce for the greater glory of God. No sooner had the young Archduke\r\nbegun to rule, than week after week, in one town or another, Styria\r\nbeheld the repression of the Reformed worship, till with quiet but\r\ndreadful strength Ferdinand had shut up every heretical temple, \"to\r\nthe astonishment of all Germany,\" as Schiller naïvely says. In this\r\nmanner did he kindle the flame; and at the end of thirty years the\r\nProtestantism of Austria, Bohemia, Styria, and other states was no\r\nmore. This work went on till the revocation of the Edict of Nantes well\r\nnigh accomplished for France what had been completely accomplished for\r\nAustria by Ferdinand, and for Bavaria by Maximilian.\r\n\r\nThe fighting Company of Jesus now looks to a similar process for\r\nresults similar in nature, but on a wider scale. Colleges and high\r\nschools are preparing young princes, nobles, and gentlemen to bear\r\nthe part of leaders, one at the Court, another in the parliament and\r\na third in the camp. Elementary schools are training the followers.\r\nAll round the Catholic horizon, in the literature of the new dominion,\r\none object looms up out of clouds of hazy words, dilates before the\r\nimagination of the devout, and towers till others are dwarfed; and this\r\nobject is the Crusade of St. Peter. Lads with old blood in their veins\r\nare learning how glorious it will be to lead a charge or to command a\r\ndivision in the greatest of all Crusades, for the most glorious of all\r\nrestorations; and poor lads are learning how they that smite like Peter\r\nJong will win in death the palm of the martyr.\r\n\r\nM. Veuillot's description of the duty of governments in respect of\r\neducation was terse: \"To allow men to be made against this perpetual\r\nplague of revolution.\" To do this, governments must set aside all\r\nother moral authorities but one. The authority of parents may, indeed,\r\ndetermine for their children questions of diet and of dress, of calling\r\nor of fortune, but the priest is the father of the child's soul, and\r\nmust determine the whole of its moral regimen. In keeping with this,\r\nthe authorities of a parish or a commune, as representing the parents\r\nof a neighbourhood; a corporation, as representing the parents of a\r\ncity; a legislature, as representing the parents of the whole land, can\r\nnowhere else be so effectually shut out from the realm of morals as in\r\nthe school. Not, we would once more say, that the devout Ultramontane\r\nbelieves that by shutting them out he is loosening moral ties, for\r\nhe thinks that by ensuring full scope to the sole authority, of the\r\npriest, he best defends every moral right. The object of training\r\nthat union of families which we call a State, to regard itself as a\r\nunion without any higher end than a material one, having in it neither\r\ndivine office nor divine authority, is an object which cannot be so\r\nimpressively advanced by any other means as when, at the bidding of\r\npriests, a government by law renounces control over the moral portion\r\nof the training of its own citizens, conducted under its own direction\r\nand paid for out of its own funds. The object of training the laity to\r\nown that it is not for them to have any opinion as to what, in morals\r\nor in faith, is true or false, or for them to assume any responsibility\r\nas to what is right or wrong, saving always the responsibility of\r\nfulfilling the directions of their spiritual guides, can never be more\r\neffectually promoted than when the representatives of the households\r\nof an entire community, having set up schools and provided for their\r\nmaintenance, hand over to priests the power to determine whether any\r\nmoral training shall be given in those schools or not, and, if any,\r\nwhat. When all this can be carried out in the normal manner, matters\r\nare so arranged that throughout the days of impressible youth, no\r\nauthority shall be heard of, as deciding any moral question, but\r\nthat of the priest of God. When circumstances prevent the normal\r\narrangements from being carried out, the way for them will be best\r\nprepared by whatever compromise leads the State furthest away from\r\nprinciples opposed to those of the Pontiff, and entangles it in what\r\nis called a practical solution wherein his principles are, if only\r\nvirtually, conceded. In preparing such a solution, dangers to be\r\nshunned by his agents are anything that would practically recognize the\r\nright of parents, singly or collectively, to decide moral questions\r\nfor their children independently of the priests; anything that would\r\nrecognize in the laity a right of moral or religious self-direction;\r\nanything that would, in practice, show that others than Romanists have\r\nthe power of uniting for moral and religious purposes; anything that\r\nwould allow the Bible to be honoured as a public standard without a\r\npriest; anything that would embody the hateful and condemned principle\r\nof the equality of different denominations before the law.\r\n\r\nBishop Reinkens has described what is the practical effect of the\r\ntraining now being given to very large portions of the children in\r\nEurope. It is, he says, to fix in the mind the conviction \"that\r\nRoman Catholics have a divinely guaranteed right, under certain\r\ncircumstances, violently to overturn existing authorities, and the\r\nchiefs of those authorities, if they have only the power to do so,\r\nand that it is an exercise of virtue to employ all means for that\r\nend.\" Bishop Reinkens[490] asserts that what formerly was regarded as\r\na mere theory of the Curia is now its practice, namely, that, in the\r\nlanguage of John Capestrano, the Pope \"can abrogate all human rights,\"\r\nand that \"what has the force of law is just what is pleasing to him.\"\r\nEven already, according to Bishop Reinkens, does the denominational\r\ninstruction given in schools in Germany justify the prediction of\r\nHefele to the effect that, for scholastic purposes, the new exaltation\r\nof the Papal power would be made the primary dogma. The bishop solemnly\r\nadds: \"The divine power of the Pope over all human beings perplexes the\r\nchildren in the schools; they early learn to obey the Vicegerent of God\r\nagainst the empire and the emperor. In the superior schools, the higher\r\nscholastic clergy attend to the same thing\" (p. 8).\r\n\r\nThe most urgent question appears to be, How far will the control of\r\nschools in France ultimately enable the priests to determine the\r\ndestination of French armies, and how far will their partial control\r\nof schools in other countries enable them to support any movements\r\nof France, so as to sway Roman Catholic governments, and to paralyse\r\neven Protestant ones? The enthusiastic priest strangely exaggerates\r\nthe power of his order. The superficial politician no less strangely\r\nunderrates it. What we at present know is, not what the clerical party\r\nwill be able to accomplish, but the simple fact that the hold which it\r\nnow has upon schools in France, Spain, Germany, England, and elsewhere,\r\nassures to it, in the next generation, a vast number of men trained\r\nin the doctrine of the Syllabus, and imbued with the antipathies and\r\nthe hopes which, in the eye of a Jesuit, form the cardinal virtues of\r\na soldier of God. Jesuits are often very unsuccessful in training the\r\nconvictions, turning as they do many of their pupils into deadly foes.\r\nBut they seldom fail to train the antipathies. Hatred of scriptural\r\nChristianity is almost invariably a ruling passion with both classes of\r\ntheir pupils, the Papists and the infidels. To all true disciples of\r\nthe new school, the holiest of public ends will be the reconstruction\r\nof society in every country under the sky, according to the outline of\r\nthe Syllabus. In pursuit of that end all means will to them be not only\r\nfair but meritorious, if adopted with a real intention to the greater\r\nglory of God. And the States of Europe have put it into the power of\r\npriests to train millions for the new school. And England has given\r\nto the effort very considerable encouragement, though doubtless that\r\nencouragement is praiseworthy in such eyes as those of the Marquis of\r\nRipon and Lord Robert Montagu, both of whom have held high place in our\r\ndepartment of education.\r\n\r\nThe _Stimmen aus Maria Laach_ met the first mutterings of discontent\r\nwith the Syllabus by saying that when those who, in pride of power,\r\nwere resisting its authority, had passed away, those judgments of the\r\nPontiff would be taught from every chair in the Catholic world. That\r\nforecast is already fulfilled. The politics of the Syllabus and the\r\nmorals of teachers like Gury are now everywhere forming the clergy of\r\nthe future. And very carefully are the laity being trained in the same\r\nprinciples, less expanded. To them the ideal of the one commonwealth,\r\nwith its one pastor-king, its unity of faith, its glory of ceremonial,\r\nits divine law, and its supernatural magistracy, is made to appear as\r\nthe fairest of ideals, as one, indeed, truly divine. Many brave English\r\nboys--heirs, some of them, to what once were noted Protestant names;\r\nboys whose fathers or grandfathers our great schools and noblest\r\ncolleges trained up in gross ignorance of the principles that are\r\ncontending for the government of the world--are now imbibing from\r\ncontinental priests principles and passions that will one day appear in\r\nour mess-rooms and our legislature. And what are our great schools and\r\ncolleges even now doing to prepare our youth generally to understand\r\nwhat the pupils of priests approve, what they condemn, and what they\r\nmean when, to innocent Englishmen, they appear to assert one thing and\r\nto deny another? Has the Papal cry for the exclusion of modern history\r\nfrom national universities been met by any sensible attempt to teach\r\nanything as to the elements struggling in contemporaneous history,\r\nespecially the most potent ones?\r\n\r\nIn that strange literature to which the Prefects of the Pope give the\r\nname of pastorals, it is in mystic phrases often indicated that the\r\nflocks of the bellicose shepherds are to be prepared for a terrific\r\ncombat. Sometimes the veil is dropped and in plain language war is\r\nspoken of as the only means of avenging the Church for her wrongs. Men\r\ncalled bishops in the vineyard of Jesus Christ speak of the mustering\r\nof the opposed hosts, and of the inevitable collision, covering the\r\ndesign of raising nation against nation, and of raising the people\r\nagainst their own rulers, by allusions to the fact that in the\r\nbeginning the Church had to act without the kings, and that once more\r\nshe will be obliged to throw herself upon the people. In Protestant\r\ncountries, or in mixed ones, aged men in sacred vestments will say,\r\nwithout a blush, that the Pope himself would not make war. But let only\r\na glimmer of political hope invite, and then kings and queens, ay,\r\nex-kings and ex-queens, are applied to; and could the Pope only find\r\nbayonets, the same aged men in the same sacred vestments, and again\r\nwithout a blush, would be heard proving that in making war the Pope was\r\nonly fulfilling a painful duty imposed upon him by his office as the\r\nVicar of Christ! At this day Europe witnesses a stage of the movement\r\nof reconstruction, at which every cope and mitre in the Papal hierarchy\r\ncovers a centre of force impelling to a general war. Every grey-headed\r\nbishop is an official promoter of a cataclysm that shall engulf all\r\nthat opposes the Syllabus. Every friar schoolmaster and every quiet\r\nnun who teaches school is a trainer for future bloodshed. Even at his\r\naudiences the man of more than fourscore years old fans the flame in\r\nlittle children dressed as soldiers, sometimes the boys of English\r\nconverts; and convert fathers flatter him by hoping that their sons\r\nwill yet bear his banner, so are womanhood, childhood, and old age all\r\nfascinated by the war passion of the priest.[491]\r\n\r\nWe do not pretend to know how it is calculated that the great struggle\r\nis to be brought on. We should think that, confidently as its approach\r\nis foretold, it must be doubtful to all but those whose faith rests\r\nonly on the divine destiny of the Papacy. Yet many who may not believe\r\nthat the Pope is about to recover Rome, and then to make Rome the\r\ncapital of the world, and who do not even believe that he will succeed\r\nin bringing about a general struggle with a view to those ends, do\r\nnevertheless fully believe that he will succeed in leading forth France\r\nonce more against the Italians, and that he will, in some general\r\ncomplication, be able to find means of unsettling other interests so\r\nas to advance his own. To this it is replied that the Jesuits who\r\nfoster these hopes are poor politicians; and that is perfectly true.\r\nYet they are skilled in intrigue, and versed in the ways of courts\r\nand of cliques. They proudly note their hold upon schools in France,\r\ntheir growing hold upon colleges, the zeal of General Charette and\r\nhis ex-pontifical zouaves, the military preaching of Count Mun, the\r\nadhesion to the dominion of the Syllabus publicly signified by many\r\nFrench generals whose names are trumpeted with a joyful noise; and with\r\nspecial pride do they note such an incident as that which occurred at\r\na recent examination in the great military college of St. Cyr, when,\r\nout of twenty-eight candidates for admission, no less than twenty-two\r\ncame from one Jesuit college. They note the clubs and associations\r\neverywhere spreading; that of the Sacred Heart, said to number a\r\nmillion of members; that of Jesu-Workmen and that of Jesu-King, meant\r\nto organize in factory, workshop, and palace a company of soldiers as\r\ntrue to the chair of St. Peter as the central Company of Jesus. They\r\nnote the numbers of the official class who believe that \"moral order\"\r\nis to be promoted by the priests. They note the zeal of ladies, and of\r\nthe aristocracy.\r\n\r\nBeyond those encouragements openly proclaimed, lies that mystery which,\r\nin Roman Catholic countries, envelopes all Courts. At the time when\r\nThiers was taking counsel with Louis Philippe for the fortification of\r\nParis, or even when Guizot was making himself the tool of the court for\r\ncompassing the Spanish marriages, who would have dared to tell those\r\nstatesmen that both of them would survive to see the day when the fate\r\nof France for peace or war, slipping out of the hands of an exhausted\r\nBonaparte, would virtually fall into those of one who was then a\r\nSpanish girl in a private station, one whose very name was unknown to\r\nthe people of France? To this Court element of strange uncertainty--and\r\nwomen and priests can weave webs around presidents as well as around\r\nemperors--is to be added the solid fact that even Frenchmen, who hate\r\nthe priests and dread their politics, are not healed of the idea that\r\nit is well to have weak neighbours, so divided that, at any time, an\r\ninvasion of their territory is more a matter of excitement than of\r\nserious peril. Against all this what have we to set? Humanly speaking,\r\nonly the fund of good sense and good feeling which, in spite of all\r\nappearances to the contrary, does exist among the French people to a\r\ndegree far greater than they who do not know them well can realize.\r\nAnd beyond this, the good providence of God; for surely France is not\r\nto become a second Spain, or else to be partitioned, one or other of\r\nwhich lots would seem to be before her if the priests can drive her as\r\nthey hope to do.\r\n\r\nThe \"good Press\" gloats over every prospect of a general broil of\r\nnations. The failure in 1870 of calculations as to what would occur in\r\nthe Catholic portions of Germany on the breaking out of a war between\r\nFrance and Prussia, did not change the current of Ultramontane hope.\r\nAny great conflict, it seems to be assumed, must somehow lead to a\r\nrestoration of the Pope. The poor old man has himself all along fed\r\na belief in the certainty of that restoration. At first he seemed to\r\nemit tentative prophecies giving mystic hints of dates. Time blotted\r\nout the dates hinted at. Then came declarations more general but\r\nperhaps more impressive to the conscience of his disciples. On the\r\nsecond anniversary of the Roman _plébiscite_, after many promises of\r\nrestoration had been long overdue, the aged high priest said to the\r\nnobles of Rome--\r\n\r\n    Yes, this change, this triumph is to come: and IT IS OF FAITH.\r\n    Whether it is to come while I am living, while this poor Vicar of\r\n    Jesus Christ is living, I know not. I know that it is to come. _The\r\n    resurrection is to take place_, and this great impiety is to have\r\n    an end (_Discorsi_, ii. p. 82).\r\n\r\nWhen from the lips of the Pontiff speaking as Vicar of Jesus Christ\r\nfall the words \"It is of faith,\" it is hard to see how the body which\r\nhas now bound itself to take the faith from his lips can help accepting\r\nthem as a prophecy which that body is bound to see fulfilled. And it\r\nis no insignificant proof of the portentous contents of that one dogma\r\ncalled Papal infallibility that so soon after it had been adopted,\r\nthe creature invested by his fellow-creatures with such control over\r\nthem should, in the name of the meek Prince of Peace, commit what they\r\nconsider their faith to a temporal throne for a minister of the gospel.\r\n\r\nOn the very day on which the nobles received the above prophecy,\r\nthe same lips told the youths of the Catholic Association that the\r\nfaithful, now passing through the deep, would soon reach the further\r\nshore of the Red Sea, and would cry with Moses, \"We will sing unto\r\nthe Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider\r\nhath He thrown into the sea.\" So were the Italians to fall, for as the\r\n_Civiltá_ expresses it, \"Which is of more account, the greatness of one\r\nhuman kingdom, or the independence and the liberty of the kingdom of\r\nGod?\" (X. ii. 143).\r\n\r\nWhen the Pope said, The resurrection is to take place, he reflected\r\nlanguage used in an address presented to him a few days previously, on\r\nthe sad anniversary of the commencement of the \"captivity,\" as it is\r\ncalled, the second time it came round. The _Piana Federation_ said--\r\n\r\n    Similar in your passion to the God-man of whom You are the Vicar on\r\n    earth, the second day of Your mystic burial is fulfilled, amid the\r\n    confusion of society and of Your impious guards, destined, in spite\r\n    of themselves, and in the day which God shall appoint, to bear\r\n    testimony to Your resurrection. In the august sepulchre wherein\r\n    those whom You had laden with benefits have confined You, wrapped\r\n    in the sweet spices of the lamentation and the love of Your sons,\r\n    You also descend into the abyss of society as now existing, and\r\n    there does Your voice resound, casting down the demons of sect, and\r\n    consoling those who anxious and trembling await the blessed hour\r\n    when with You they are to rise again. And the third day is already\r\n    commencing; but, as it was not completed for the Divine Saviour,\r\n    so have we confidence that no more will it be completed for You,\r\n    O Holy Father: the prayers of the blessed Virgin whom You have so\r\n    greatly honoured, the prayers of the Saints, Patrons of the Church\r\n    and of Rome, with those of so many souls who suffer and who weep\r\n    to obtain Your liberation, your triumph, will shorten this day of\r\n    utmost anguish, and God, God whom your enemies do with Satanic\r\n    impiety unceasingly defy, will not permit the day to close without\r\n    having witnessed the fulfilment of the devout desires of Your\r\n    sons.[492]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these promises, not only did the third \"day\" run its\r\ncourse but the sixth has set, with the Satanic guards still standing\r\naround the august sepulchre. For six years Italy has held Rome as\r\nher capital, and Pius IX has confined himself to the Vatican, making\r\nspeeches. But at this moment the hope of a general complication, and\r\nof a restoration as the effect of it, is very likely. The present\r\nobscuration of the Papacy is treated as if it were passing and light\r\nas the shadow of an April cloud on the Alban Hills. The shadow will\r\npass and the hills will abide. Rome, for a moment the mere capital of\r\na kingdom, is to be the capital of the world. Let but the temporal\r\npower be once restored, and then the steps to the universal theocratic\r\nmonarchy can be taken both with deeper secrecy and with greater force.\r\n\r\nEven those who most despise the political influence of the priests must\r\nown that for disturbance their power is great. Taking the sixty years\r\nwhich have elapsed since the peace of 1815, let us, for a moment, look\r\nat the Roman Catholic countries of Christendom, and at the non-Catholic\r\nones, in respect of the one blessing of public repose. In those\r\nsixty years the three great Protestant powers--England, Prussia, and\r\nAmerica--have not drawn the sword one against the other. The smaller\r\nProtestant powers have not fought among themselves. No Protestant\r\ncapital has undergone a foreign occupation. With the exception of\r\nAmerica, no Protestant State has been desolated by civil war. No\r\nProtestant army has been given to military insurrection, or has, in the\r\nday of trial, proved untrue. No Protestant sovereign has been expelled\r\nby his own people. No Protestant President of a Republic has been\r\nexecuted, or exiled, or condemned as a traitor. No Protestant monarchy\r\nhas been changed by violence into a republic; no Protestant republic\r\ninto a monarchy. If we set off as one against the other, the war of\r\nGerman unity which partly occurred in the one group of States, and that\r\nof Italian unity which occurred in the other group, the only case of\r\nwar between Protestant States, in the two generations, has been that of\r\nPrussia and Denmark, and the only case of war between two great powers\r\nnon-Catholic has been that of Russia and England, in the Crimea. But\r\nhow has it been on the Papal side of the line?\r\n\r\nNo leading Catholic power can be named which has not within the sixty\r\nyears made war on other Catholic powers as well as on non-Catholic\r\nones. France has fought with Spain, with the Italians, with Austria,\r\nas well as with Russia, with Prussia, with Holland, and has even gone\r\naway to Mexico to seek a war of which the Vatican spoke as if it were\r\na campaign of the Church. Austria has fought with Italy and with\r\nFrance, as well as with Prussia and with Denmark. As to the wars of\r\nCatholic States in America with one another, they have been numerous.\r\nRome has undergone twenty years of foreign occupation; France has\r\nundergone two; and Austria has had recourse to foreign intervention.\r\nCivil war in Portugal, civil wars in Spain, civil war in Austria, civil\r\nwar repeatedly in Italy apart from the great war of unity, civil war\r\nchronically in the American Catholic States, have made that plague\r\nfamiliar in Roman Catholic countries. The foremost, and the least\r\npriest-ridden of them, France, has had her three days of July, her\r\nthree days of February, her four darker days of June, her bloody days\r\nof December, her awful weeks of the Commune. Military insurrections\r\nproperly so-called have not occurred in the great Catholic nations\r\nthat refused to submit to the disciplinary decrees of the Council of\r\nTrent. But in Spain, Portugal, and the nations of America, military\r\ninsurrection, that worst of anarchies, seems to have acquired a sort\r\nof prescriptive place in the Constitution. In Italy, till 1860, the\r\narmies of the princes faithful to the Papacy were largely foreign.\r\nAs to conspiracies and risings, it is strange that where they have\r\noccurred out of Roman Catholic States they have often been among the\r\nRoman Catholic portion of the population; and in Roman Catholic States\r\nthey have been much more frequent within the circle of countries where\r\nthe decrees of Trent had been fully accepted, than in those which,\r\nby Gallican liberties, Josephine laws, or in some other form, uphold\r\nnational supremacy. As to thrones in Roman Catholic countries, the\r\ndifficulty is to name those which during the sixty years have not been\r\nemptied by violence; Austria and Sardinia, perhaps, exhaust the list,\r\nin both of which, however, an abdication, compelled by misfortune,\r\nhas taken place. Twice has a limited monarchy, once an empire, and\r\nonce a republic, been overthrown in France by revolution. As to Spain\r\nand South America, it were weary work to count up catastrophes.\r\nThe discrowned princes who, like ghosts, haunt Europe, and the\r\nex-presidents under ban who prowl in America, are nearly all Roman\r\nCatholics.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the entire course of history does not afford an example of any\r\ncontemporaneous development of four great Powers, bringing with it in\r\nthe aggregate such an increase of territory, population, and strength,\r\nas that which within the sixty years since the peace of Vienna has\r\noccurred in the case of the four non-Catholic Powers, Russia, Prussia,\r\nAmerica, and England. No corresponding development has taken place in\r\nRoman Catholic or in Moslem nations. Italy, indeed, has risen up, but\r\nonly by breaking the yoke of the Papacy, and by swimming against a\r\nsulphurous stream of anathemas.\r\n\r\nIt would be a curious and not altogether an idle speculation did some\r\nclear-headed and calm economist carefully work out the question, What\r\nwould be the effect in the course of three hundred years, upon the\r\npeace of Europe, on the bulk of standing armies, on the stability of\r\nthrones, on the development of arts, sciences, laws, and morals, on the\r\nsecurity of life and property, and on the general spread of charity,\r\nbrotherhood, and virtue among men, supposing that by some unseen power\r\nthe hundreds of thousands of priests, now working to bring about the\r\ndominion of the Pope over our species, could be instantly changed into\r\nsimple ministers of the gospel, without a political head or a political\r\naim, but each one seeking only to bring the wicked to repentance and to\r\nlead the godly onward, adding virtue unto virtue and grace to grace?\r\nWould the change bring France more wars and more revolutions? Would\r\nthe change make the new career opened to Italy more obscure or thorny?\r\nWould the change make Austria feebler, or make Spain less united and\r\nprosperous? Would it bring a blight upon Mexico? and in South America\r\nwould it make the rulers less tranquil, the people less obedient to\r\nlaw, and less attached to order? Would the south and west of Ireland\r\nless strongly attract capital and residence? Would Croatia be less\r\nrefined? Would the island of Sardinia be less highly civilized? Would\r\nSicily be less secure? Would the dominion of Canada be more difficult\r\nto govern? Would the city of New York and other cities of the United\r\nStates in which the political power of priests is now formidable be\r\nworse ordered and more corrupt? In Hayti and St. Domingo, would public\r\naffairs be more unstable, would family life be more blameworthy?\r\n\r\nOr conversely: What would be the effect of a change in the opposite\r\ndirection? Suppose that at once every Protestant minister could be\r\nchanged into a zealous priest, and that the Headship of the Pope\r\ncould exert its full influence unshackled by those restraints which\r\nhave hampered him ever since the Reformation--partly, indeed, ever\r\nsince the large-eyed man of Lutterworth brought into existence that\r\nterrible thing the English Bible--and suppose that with all the\r\nliberty of power and all the power of liberty he could rule over the\r\nwhole of Christendom as completely as he formerly ruled over his own\r\nStates, what would be the practical effect? Would Scotland produce\r\nmore authors, heroes, and worthies, fewer beggars, thieves, rioters,\r\nand assassins, than she does to-day? Would England produce more good\r\nlandlords, more comfortable tenants, more honest merchants, more bright\r\nmen of letters and science, more deeds of Christian charity, and fewer\r\ncivil wars, fewer conspiracies, fewer insurrections, fewer military\r\nrevolts, fewer beggared nobles, and fewer ill-cultivated estates than\r\nshe does to-day? Would Germany be more united? Would Holland, Denmark,\r\nand Sweden be more stable? Would the United States be more prosperous,\r\nmore free, and more peaceable? Would the British Colonies be increasing\r\ntranquil and enlightened?\r\n\r\nWith the facts of the past, and the principles of the present which\r\nare to be the plastic forces of the future, before him, a calm\r\nand wide-minded observer, taking long stretches of time and great\r\nvarieties of circumstance to illustrate any hypothesis and to test\r\nany conclusion, might form an estimate which would not be without a\r\nproperly scientific value. We are often told by one class of writers\r\nthat Roman Catholics are as good subjects as Protestants, and by\r\nanother that in proportion to their numbers they yield a much greater\r\namount of illiteracy, of turbulence, of pauperism, and of offences\r\nagainst the law. These are points which statesmen have no right to\r\nleave to theologians, and on which they have no right to remain\r\nthemselves in doubt. Above all, they have no right if not in doubt\r\nabout them, but if they have on sufficient grounds a clear opinion,\r\nto keep that opinion back, or to cloud it by ambiguities. Both in\r\nEngland and in America there are intelligent and loyal men who believe\r\nthat they are more burdened and that public law and order are less\r\nwell observed in proportion as priests have power over any section of\r\nthe population. These are questions of fact capable of a scientific\r\nsolution, and it is the duty of statesmen scientifically to solve them.\r\nIf the authorities, which are clearly natural and Christian, clearly\r\nboth divine and human, are undermined where priests do not rule and\r\nare built up where they do, let statesmen tell mankind that it is so.\r\nIf the unnatural, the merely artificial authority of the priest is\r\nproved, on a test of ages, of various races, and of various polities,\r\nto be unfriendly rather than helpful to the stability and vigour of\r\nlawful authority, then let all incumbents of that authority--kings,\r\npresidents, nobles, lawgivers, magistrates, parents, and husbands--lift\r\nup a clear voice, the voice of intelligent conviction, and tell all men\r\nhow the matter stands. \"The sword of the mouth\" is the only sword which\r\nought to be drawn in this war; and if they to whom God has given real\r\nauthority draw that sword against the spurious authority of the priest,\r\nit will prevent the call which otherwise will surely come to draw a\r\nfeebler sword but a bloody one. Priestcraft, mighty against artifice,\r\nsubtle against force, invincible against compromise and subterfuge, is\r\nstrangely weak against a calm and Christian denial of its authority.\r\n\r\nLong since this chapter was written, we find that the Italian journals\r\nwhile noting the base immorality which week by week is brought to\r\nlight among the priests, and pointing to their multitude and the low\r\nrepute of many of them as a moral plague, now (1877) fasten upon them\r\neven more than of wont charges of exciting anarchical conspiracies.\r\nThe _Emancipatore Cattolico_, the organ of what is called the Italian\r\nNational Catholic Church, formed by the priests who belonged to the\r\nSociety for the Emancipation and Mutual Aid of the Clergy, writes as\r\nfollows--\r\n\r\n    The _red_ International, in appearance with a different end and\r\n    program, but in reality in full accord with its _black_ sister,\r\n    after the stimulus from the Vatican sets itself in motion, and\r\n    lifts up its head.... We ask, Has the alliance of this double\r\n    International a probability of success in a future nearer or more\r\n    remote? We do not hesitate to reply affirmatively if the powers and\r\n    States in the two hemispheres do not agree rather to overthrow the\r\n    _black_ international which is the true and efficient cause of the\r\n    other, than the _red_ which is the effect.... Christian governments\r\n    of Europe, open your eyes! the international that truly menaces\r\n    you, and that will undo you if you are not wise, is that of the\r\n    Vatican. You accept it and smile upon it because you suppose it to\r\n    be the conservator and champion of order and authority; but the\r\n    order and the authority which it represents and champions are those\r\n    of the absorption of all the social powers into the despotic and\r\n    arbitrary will of a miserable mortal who believes himself to be\r\n    God, and who as such imposes himself upon the entire universe.[493]\r\n\r\nWhile these last sheets have been passing through the press, events\r\nhave occurred which illustrate many of the hints contained in this\r\nchapter. Many who, when we first began to write this work, would have\r\nseen nothing \"practical\" in that solemn hint of Vitelleschi when,\r\nspeaking of the frequent occurrence of disturbances at the same time\r\nwhen the Church is pressing some point upon a government, he says that\r\nthe circumstance is an organic phenomenon deserving of the most serious\r\nattention, now begin to feel that it is scarcely rational any longer to\r\nbe insensible to facts which day after day rise into the view of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn March 1877, Pius IX delivered a carefully-prepared Allocution, full\r\nof bitter attacks on Italy, and manifestly intended to raise once more\r\nthe Roman Question. A feverish agitation becoming speedily discernible\r\nin different countries, none could help noting the coincidence of the\r\ntwo events. In Italy broke out an attempt at insurrection in Benevento,\r\nprofessedly by socialists, but as the Italian papers believed fomented\r\nand directed by priests. This was speedily followed by a vote of the\r\nItalian Senate, by which that body threw out a Bill, that had been\r\npassed by the Lower House, for restraining ministers of religion,\r\nof all denominations, from certain abuses of their office. Italian\r\njournals of different shades intimated their impression that this event\r\nwas solely due to the direct action of the Pope upon the king, and of\r\nthe king upon a number of courtier senators.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards the Prime Minister of France, M. Jules Simon,\r\nexplained in debate, with all propriety of language, that the popular\r\nidea about the Pope being a prisoner was unfounded. The Pope, in\r\nthat characteristic style which has never risen to the level even of\r\nmunicipal, much less of national public life, stated that a certain\r\ngovernment had said that the Pope was a liar; and as if to rehabilitate\r\nany one who might have been so impertinent, he added that he did not\r\nknow what government it was! Soon afterwards, on May 16, 1877, M. Simon\r\nwas abruptly dismissed by Marshal MacMahon, and the Assembly, of which\r\na majority supported M. Simon, was silenced by an enforced adjournment.\r\nThis pale edition of a _coup d'état_ was hailed and claimed by the\r\nclerical papers as a direct result of the interference of the Pope. Its\r\nill effects in France forced upon many the reflection, how enviable is\r\nthe lot of nations in which the influence of the Pontiff is feeble, and\r\nhow well would it be with any nation in which that influence should be\r\n_nil_!\r\n\r\nStrange does it seem that the prophets of reconstruction should for\r\nencouragement point more frequently to France and England than to\r\nany other countries. To France they look for military service, to\r\nEngland for religious converts. The one is to glorify the Church by\r\na sacred war, the other by an edifying submission. In France they\r\ncount upon the schoolmasters, the army, the ancient aristocracy, and\r\nmany of the politicians. In England they count upon that portion of\r\nthe clergy which they call the Puseyite party, upon a portion of the\r\naristocracy, upon the ceremonies in the churches, and the teaching\r\nin the denominational schools. Grossly exaggerating, as they do, the\r\nposition and the influence of Cardinal Manning, and speaking at times\r\nas if the whole English hierarchy, unable to face him, were trembling\r\nand falling down before him, they also exaggerate the strides actually\r\nmade by the Ritualistic party in carrying the whole nation towards\r\nsubmission to Rome. They boast, in the language of Dr. Newman, that\r\nthe English Church is, through that party, \"doing our work;\"[494] and\r\nthey always seem to have taken to heart the principle which he taught\r\nthem as long ago as 1841: \"Only through the English Church can you act\r\nupon the English nation.\"[495] They are not much read in our political\r\nliterature, and when they meddle with it, often make strange blunders.\r\nBut some of them are shrewdly aware of the services done to their cause\r\nby writers who treat Ritualism as a matter of aesthetics, and treat\r\neach particular ceremony as a trifle.\r\n\r\nLooking back on the turns and windings of the movement for\r\nreconstruction, and remembering how little human foresight would have\r\navailed to predict either their successive phases or the results up to\r\nthe present hour, it is natural to feel that as to those further turns\r\nand windings which as yet lie out of ken, hidden behind the veil of\r\nan inscrutable Providence, it is not for us presumptuously to divine.\r\nRather would we, in humble hope, await the future, so far as to us it\r\nmay be permitted to witness its unfolding. In the sixty years since\r\nthe peace of Vienna the Papacy has passed through two distinct stages,\r\nof thirty years each; the one up to the beginning of the present\r\npontificate, the other during the course of it. In the first thirty\r\nyears the flag displayed was that of Liberal Catholicism. During that\r\ntime the Papacy gained emancipation in England and Ireland, a footing\r\nin the schools of France and Belgium, a repute of liberality and other\r\ngreat advantages; while on the whole it held its ground in Italy,\r\nSpain, Austria, and the minor States. But a true instinct taught the\r\nCuria that temporary gain was preparing final ruin. Since 1849 the\r\npolicy has been reversed, and the external results to the Papacy so far\r\nhave been disadvantageous. \"Catholic unity\" has been lost in Italy,\r\nSpain, Portugal, Austria, Mexico, Brazil, and elsewhere. In Poland the\r\nlosses to the Church have been immense, whether they may be due to the\r\npersecuting policy of Russia, as the Catholic party alleges, or to the\r\nrebellious excitements of the Pope and the priests, as others allege,\r\nor to both these causes united, as seems most probable. In Switzerland\r\nand Germany the Papacy has had heavy loss, and its future is gloomy.\r\nIn France it has made immense gains; in Ireland heavy loss; in England\r\ngain, and that of the kind it values most--gain by the help of the\r\nclergy, of the aristocracy, and of a great university. But still,\r\nwhile the population of the United Kingdom has much increased, Pius\r\nIX cannot count among the thirty millions now inhabiting it so many\r\nRoman Catholics as he found among, say, five millions less. He has to\r\nnote a decrease in Poland concurrently with persecution, and one in\r\nthe British Isles concurrently with extended political privileges. The\r\nCuria, if not unconscious of these losses, never confesses to them,\r\nand avers that the increased compactness gained by recent changes\r\nfar more than compensates for any increased opposition, and in fact\r\ninsures the overthrow of all resisting forces; while the submission of\r\nEngland--Queen, bishops, lords, and people--is spoken of as a thing\r\nnigh at hand to the eye of faith. Firmly, however, do we believe that\r\nin mercy to this great empire, within which dwells in peace and with\r\nample privileges a portion of mankind larger than ever before under one\r\nsceptre enjoyed the blessings of free government, and in mercy also\r\nto the whole redeemed race in the midst of which this empire holds a\r\nplace so influential and on the whole so beneficent, never will England\r\njustify the promises of submission to the Pope wherewith continental\r\npriests are wont to cheer the courage of their partisans, albeit they\r\nproudly point to men in important places, and boast how the triumph of\r\nthe Vatican is being prepared under the patronage of both Church and\r\nState.\r\n\r\nAll this notwithstanding, we do not believe that the English\r\ncommons are to be reduced into a populace without constitutional\r\nrepresentation; or that the English aristocracy is to be reduced\r\ninto an order of nobles without constitutional powers; or that our\r\nmagistracy, from squire up to chancellor, is to be put under the\r\nbishops' courts; or that our chairs of philosophy, science, and\r\nliterature are to be placed under the tutelage of chairs of theology\r\nfilled by Jesuits, or by men of whom Jesuits approve; or that our\r\nuniversities are to be placed under Romish canon law; or that the\r\npriest, to the exclusion of the State and of the laity, is to be made\r\nas completely moral lord of all the schools in England as he is now of\r\nhis denominational schools; or that the works of our authors are to\r\nwait till a Dominican has cut out what he deems amiss, and has written\r\non the remainder _Imprimatur_; or that our printers are to wait for a\r\nlicence from the friars; or that our journals and periodicals are to\r\nbe cut down to the proportions which were allowed to the Press in the\r\nModel State; or that our armies are to be composed of men so schooled\r\nthat to them the word of the priest shall take the lawful command\r\nout of the lips of the king. No more do we believe that from these\r\nEnglish shores the dear old English Bible is to be driven away as a\r\nforbidden book. Neither do we believe that for these fair fields of\r\nBritain that dark Saturday night is to come after which will no more\r\ndawn the English Sunday morning--a morning when streets thronged and\r\ncountry lanes enlivened with families wending their way to worship\r\nGod, each as led by the voice of conscience, and each jealous for the\r\nreligious liberty of its neighbours as well as for its own, present a\r\nmore Christian-like and more solid display of unity in variety, and of\r\ncatholicity in charity, than ever can be gained by any preciseness of\r\nconstrained uniformity. Never will our own happy Sunday morning cease\r\nto shine; never instead of it will a dismal day come when the sound\r\nof the church-going bell shall be the signal of physical force, and\r\nwhen every one whose conscience will not let him obey the official call\r\nshall be spied out by the familiars of the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nWhen priests tell Englishmen that such things as are here indicated\r\nare not really embraced within the ultimate objects of their movement,\r\nthey well know that they can deceive only those who have not sought\r\nout their principles at the fountain. And under all their illusions,\r\nthey must surely have some consciousness that such as have done so can\r\nfeel but shame and pity when they see any man, born to the blessings\r\nof English citizenship, sinking to a moral level at which he becomes\r\ncapable of attempting to move the noble power of Britain to abet the\r\ncrime of once more imposing by fire and sword upon Italy the domination\r\nof the Pontiff; and who, indeed, even to that can add the second crime\r\nof endeavouring to throw back the families of this goodly realm to the\r\nsame condition as that in which the people of the Papal States lay\r\nbefore their yoke was broken. These things would be mournful, but no\r\nmore than mournful, did the guilt of them rest only upon one English\r\nsoul in which still survived a clear consciousness of how repugnant\r\nthey were to religion and to morals, how offensive to humanity, how\r\nsubversive of good order; for when conscience still spoke, repentance\r\nmight be at hand. But such things become more than sad, they become\r\nreally formidable, when conscience itself is so warped that it learns\r\nto acquit them of all guilt--learns even to regard them as actions\r\nin which the violence and bloodshed proposed are sanctioned by\r\nreligion, and become works of Christian merit; and in which the changes\r\ncontemplated would, if indeed hurtful to nations in things temporal, be\r\nfor their eternal weal.\r\n\r\nIn this land of manifold privilege hereafter, as in the time gone by,\r\nyea, more than in the time gone by, will the people fear God, honour\r\nthe king, and prize the family Bible. They will hereafter, more than\r\nheretofore, send forth into every region under heaven their happy\r\nsons, bearing the glorious gospel of the blessed God, and with swift\r\nfeet running to tell to all men the way of salvation. In England, in\r\nIreland, and in Scotland; in every place where our own blood flows\r\nin the veins of kinsmen; in every broad State of the Transatlantic\r\nUnion; in every thriving colony that boasts the British name--may the\r\nChurches dwell together in unity--may the people grow in wisdom, in\r\nvirtue, and in faith! May this realm hereafter afford an example of\r\nlaws being evermore ameliorated under the leavening influence of the\r\nkingdom which cannot be moved, of manners ever becoming purer, and of\r\nblest contentment growing, year after year, in households over every\r\none of which shall hover the more than earthly charm of domestic\r\nbliss, hallowed at the family altar! And may the remote descendants of\r\nVictoria and Albert reign, in the love of God and in the love of man,\r\nas Christian princes over a happy Christian people, and age after age\r\nmay the throne be established in righteousness!\r\n\r\n\r\nGOD SAVE THE QUEEN!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 485: See _Civiltá_ VIII. i. 46.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 486: Quoted in _Le Concile du Vat. et le Mouvement\r\nInfaillibiliste_, p. 62.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 487: _Civiltá Cattolica_, passim, especially the number of\r\nDecember 16, 1876.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 488: VIII. i. 421.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 489: Italian papers sometimes give the total number of\r\njournals on the Continent pledged to the Pope as 580, and of these 258\r\nas published in Germany alone.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 490: _Revolution und Kirche_, p. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 491: At the last moment of reviewing this chapter, before\r\nsending it to press, months after it was written, we find Italian\r\nand French journals ringing with language ascribed to a Bishop in a\r\npastoral, which may pass as an example of the work which the officials\r\nstyled bishops are preparing for Europe.

They are all found in the _second_ volume of the\r\n_Kirchenrecht_, and we give the page with each separate citation--\r\n\r\nP. 435. \"By virtue of the supreme powers given to her, the Church has\r\nindeed a dominion over those who are without [not baptized]; but over\r\nthese she does not give sentence in the same sense as over those who\r\nthrough the door of baptism have entered into the Church, and who\r\nthrough this sacrament have received the indelible token of membership\r\nin the kingdom of Christ. These latter have in baptism sworn the oath\r\nof allegiance; they have sworn _Fidelitas_ and _Homagium_, the oath\r\nof personal believing fidelity [_fidelitas_] and that of the vassal\r\n(_Lehnseid_), of true and active service with the talents which have\r\nbeen granted to them in fee (_Zu Lehen_).\"\r\n\r\nP. 436. \"No one is exempt from this obedience--all are confided to the\r\nChurch to be guided and brought up for heaven; for all, therefore,\r\nwithout exception, is the Church an authority instituted by God. The\r\npossibility of attaining to his highest end, that of glorifying God,\r\nwhich man through disobedience had lost, Christ has given back to him\r\nagain; but this end can be attained only in the way of obedience.\r\nDisobedience against the divine Word, the _rejecting or doubting even\r\nof a single one of the divine truths announced by the Church_, puts\r\nthe individual human being again in the way of perdition, on which our\r\nfirst parents entered to their own ruin and that of their posterity,\r\nwhen they, instead of believing the simply and clearly announced Word,\r\nchose another exposition of the same, which was more agreeable to them.\"\r\n\r\nP. 438. \"Hence in particular must they grievously offend God who\r\neither directly put away from them the faith of the Church, or else\r\naccept it only in so far as it appears to them correct according to\r\nthe selection [out of her tenets] which they have made; or, again, who\r\nso break the bond of the unity of the Church as to declare themselves\r\nloose from obedience to the lawful authority which in her has been set\r\nover them by God. Thus are we led to speak of the three ecclesiastical\r\ncrimes--apostasy, heresy, and schism.\"\r\n\r\nP. 440. \"As to apostasy, which is the total rejection of the Christian\r\nfaith, and the falling away into Judaism, or heathenism, or Islamism,\r\nit is here only to be remarked that in the view of the Church it is\r\nas the crime of insulting the majesty of God. The apostate must be\r\ncompelled to return to the Church by force, and a milder judgment may\r\nbe pronounced upon him only in the case of one who was compelled to\r\ndeny his faith by the unbelievers.\"\r\n\r\nP. 441. \"In opposition to the entire rejection of the Christian\r\nfaith, heresy implies the wilful selection of a number from out of\r\nthe dogmas of the Church which are to be believed by men in all their\r\nfulness, and the restricting of faith to such selected doctrines as\r\nthe man still adheres to; in general to this is added the acceptance\r\nof false articles of faith. In this wider sense, all those are called\r\nheretics who accept only particular doctrines of the Church; but we\r\nmust distinguish between such. We must part off error from heresy.\r\nAny man may fall into error, with regard to one or another doctrine\r\nof the Church, against his own will, out of simplicity, or from want\r\nof instruction, or because he has received wrong instruction. Such an\r\nerror of the understanding is called 'material heresy'; but proper\r\nheresy, which is called 'formal heresy,' has its seat in the will. The\r\nlatter consists in this, that to error is added obstinacy of the will,\r\nwhich is disinclined to depart from it. If any one announces a doctrine\r\nand then learns that the Church teaches otherwise, thus discovering\r\nthat he was in error, he does not fall into heresy if he only ceases\r\nto defend the doctrine which he has set forth, and submits himself to\r\nthe teaching of the Church. On the other hand, one who does know that\r\nthe Church teaches otherwise, and still affirms that something is an\r\narticle of belief which is not so, or, contrariwise, that something\r\nis not an article of belief which is so, doing this in spite of the\r\nfact that the Church has delivered the truth upon the subject, he by\r\nso doing haughtily prefers his own judgment to that of the Church; and\r\nthrough this obstinacy, the characteristic mark of heresy, he becomes a\r\nheretic in the strict sense of the word.\r\n\r\n\"It is not necessary to heresy that the person shall, as a heresiarch,\r\nfound a new sect, or that, by free choice, he shall go over to a sect\r\ncondemned by the Church; but heresy is already present whenever any\r\none in the bosom of the Catholic Church departs from only one single\r\npoint of the faith, or understands one single passage of Holy Scripture\r\notherwise than as the Church, with the assistance of the Holy Ghost,\r\nexpounds them. For so great is the importance of heresy that through\r\nwant of faith even on one point, the proper foundation of faith itself\r\nis destroyed, so that he that makes himself guilty with regard to one\r\ndogma, becomes at the same time guilty as to every dogma of the Church.\r\nThus not only is he who rejects one of the articles defined by the\r\nChurch a heretic, but also he who after such a definition maintains\r\nthat the point is still doubtful.\"\r\n\r\nP. 445. \"The Church prays for the return of her separated members, and\r\nshe is entitled to proceed to compulsion by virtue of the jurisdiction\r\nover heretics as baptized persons which belongs to her; but she uses,\r\nby prayer and by the instruction which is permitted to all, the only\r\nmeans by which she can now enter into communication with them, at\r\nleast as relations at present stand.\r\n\r\n\"She may, indeed, tolerate the heathen, because they err through\r\nignorance; she may tolerate the Jews as witnesses for the truth; but\r\nshe cannot tolerate heresy, because this shakes the foundation of the\r\nentire faith. The synagogue makes way for the Church as a dutiful\r\nhandmaid, bringing her the Holy Scriptures. Heresy, however, lifts\r\nitself up as a mistress above the Church, discredits her utterly, sets\r\nitself to judge over her, and would condemn her out of Holy Scripture\r\naccording to its self-chosen exposition, closing her mouth like that of\r\nChrist. It commences with the divine Word, but it treats that word like\r\na lyre, from which every one at pleasure, may draw whatever note will\r\nsuit him.\r\n\r\n\"The Church pardons error, but she cannot subject herself to the\r\nobstinately erring will, but must destroy its dominion and its tyranny.\r\nShe, as the teacher of the truth, cannot conclude a peace with such a\r\nwill. She cannot lift it up to the throne beside her, she cannot share\r\nher dominion with it. Understood in its proper and true signification,\r\nheresy is a frightful crime. Do the heathen blaspheme God out of\r\nignorance? Heresy tears truth to pieces consciously. Did the Jews\r\ncrucify Christ according to the flesh? Heresy fastens the Church,\r\nHis mystical body, to the cross. Therefore the Church cannot at all\r\ntolerate heresy, because the greatest danger of seduction is attached\r\nto it. The Christian can easily shun the heathen and the Jew, but not\r\nthe Christian who by the baptismal vow is connected with him, but by\r\nheresy is separated from him.\r\n\r\n\"On these grounds is explained the complete intolerance which\r\nthe Church, in all her laws, and especially in the _Bulla Cæna_,\r\nhas manifested against heresy. Hence are explained the certainly\r\nhard-sounding expressions with which she speaks of heresy. Hence the\r\npunishments against heretics, the delivering up of the same to the\r\ntemporal arm, and the calling upon temporal princes by law and by arms\r\nto come to her help in rooting out heresy. When the Church pronounces\r\n_excommunication_ upon heretics, it is nothing more than a declaratory\r\nsentence of that which had already been announced by the heretics\r\nthemselves; for, all the more because these are Christians, must she\r\nseparate them from herself, that they may not be accounted as of her,\r\nand that she may not appear as chargeable for their obstinacy.\r\n\r\n\"Hence it will be understood that the Church employs all means\r\nto keep her members from being infected with heretical teaching.\r\nShe has therefore, with the apostle, forbidden _intercourse_ with\r\nheretics; yet she makes this apply, according to the Bull of Martin\r\nV, _Ad evitandos_, only to those who are personally, and by name,\r\n_excommunicated_ on account of their obstinacy. To a like end the\r\nChurch forbids to the faithful the reading of heretical writings, which\r\nstill retain that character even when the author perhaps erred only\r\nout of ignorance, and has given his books to the fire. So according\r\nto the diversities of times and circumstances does she require from\r\nher members the assurance of fidelity in making the confession of\r\nfaith, causing those who return into her bosom to abjure heresy, and\r\nprohibiting all to preach who have not thereto an express mission, and\r\nforbidding the laity to dispute as to the faith, except in cases in\r\nwhich especial exceptions are justified.\"\r\n\r\nP. 451. \"_Schism_, in its proper meaning, consists in this, that the\r\nbaptized person, while not doubting as to the faith, and while not\r\nintending to separate himself from it, declares himself free from the\r\nauthority which God has set over him in the Church. In a looser sense\r\nof the word, schism may refer to one's own bishop, as well as to the\r\nPope; properly, however, it requires separation from the centre of\r\nChurch unity, from the Pope, to constitute a schism, although revolt\r\nagainst the proper bishop, recognized by the head of the Church,\r\ncomprehends in itself separation from the entire Church. And how will\r\nthe schismatic, separated from ecclesiastical unity, preserve himself\r\nin purity of doctrine? Does heresy lead to schism? So infallibly does\r\nschism lead to heresy, inasmuch as only through false doctrine can\r\nit be justified. Therefore does the Church regard schism as a crime\r\njust as great as heresy, and in general has dealt with it in the same\r\nmanner.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTIONS \"_DEI FILIUS_\" AND \"_PASTOR ÆTERNUS_\"\r\n\r\n(_From the \"Catholic Directory\" for 1871, pp. 55 ff._)\r\n\r\nDOGMATIC CONSTITUTION ON THE CATHOLIC FAITH\r\n\r\n\r\nPius Bishop, Servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the\r\nSacred Council, for perpetual remembrance.\r\n\r\nOur Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and Redeemer of mankind, before\r\nreturning to His Heavenly Father, promised that He would be with the\r\nChurch Militant on earth all days, even to the consummation of the\r\nworld. Therefore He has never ceased to be present with His beloved\r\nSpouse, to assist her when teaching, to bless her when at work, and\r\nto aid her when in danger. And this His salutary providence, which\r\nhas been constantly displayed by other innumerable benefits, has been\r\nmost manifestly proved by the abundant good results which Christendom\r\nhas derived from OEcumenical Councils, and particularly from that of\r\nTrent, although it was held in evil times. For, as a consequence,\r\nthe sacred doctrines of the faith have been defined more closely and\r\nset forth more fully; errors have been condemned and restrained;\r\necclesiastical discipline has been restored and more firmly secured;\r\nthe love of learning and of piety has been promoted among the clergy;\r\ncolleges have been established to educate youth for the sacred warfare;\r\nand the morals of the Christian world have been renewed by the more\r\naccurate training of the faithful, and by the more frequent use of the\r\nsacraments. Moreover, there has resulted a closer communion of the\r\nmembers with the visible head, and an increase of vigour in the whole\r\nmystical body of Christ; the multiplication of religious congregations\r\nand of other institutions of Christian piety, and such ardour in\r\nextending the kingdom of Christ throughout the world, as constantly\r\nendures, even to the sacrifice of life itself.\r\n\r\nBut while we recall with due thankfulness these and other signal\r\nbenefits which the divine mercy has bestowed on the Church, especially\r\nby the last OEcumenical Council, we cannot restrain our bitter sorrow\r\nfor the grave evils which are due principally to the fact, that the\r\nauthority of that sacred Synod has been contemned, or its wise decrees\r\nneglected, by many.\r\n\r\nNo one is ignorant that the heresies proscribed by the Fathers of\r\nTrent, by which the divine teaching (_magisterium_) of the Church was\r\nrejected, and all matters regarding religion were surrendered to the\r\njudgment of each individual, gradually became dissolved into many\r\nsects, which disagreed and contended with one another, until at length\r\nnot a few lost all faith in Christ. Even the Holy Scriptures, which had\r\npreviously been declared sole source and judge of Christian doctrine,\r\nbegan to be held no longer as divine, but to be ranked among the\r\nfictions of mythology.\r\n\r\nThen there arose, and too widely overspread the world, that doctrine of\r\nrationalism, or naturalism, which opposes itself in every way to the\r\nChristian religion as a supernatural institution, and works with the\r\nutmost zeal in order that, after Christ, our sole Lord and Saviour, has\r\nbeen excluded from the minds of men, and from the life and moral acts\r\nof nations, the reign of what they call pure reason or nature may be\r\nestablished. And after forsaking and rejecting the Christian religion,\r\nand denying the true God and His Christ, the minds of many have sunk\r\ninto the abyss of Pantheism, Materialism, and Atheism, until, denying\r\nrational nature itself and every sound rule of right, they labour to\r\ndestroy the deepest foundations of human society.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, it has yet farther come to pass that, while this impiety\r\nprevailed on every side, many even of the children of the Catholic\r\nChurch have strayed from the path of true piety; and by the gradual\r\ndiminution of the truths they held, the Catholic sense has become\r\nweakened in them. For, led away by various and strange doctrines,\r\nwrongly confusing nature and grace, human science and divine faith,\r\nthey are found to deprave the true sense of the doctrines which our\r\nHoly Mother Church holds and teaches, and to endanger the integrity and\r\nthe soundness of the faith.\r\n\r\nConsidering these things, how can the Church fail to be deeply stirred?\r\nFor, even as God wills all men to be saved, and to arrive at the\r\nknowledge of the truth; even as Christ came to save what had perished,\r\nand to gather together the children of God who had been dispersed;\r\nso the Church, constituted by God the mother and teacher of nations,\r\nknows its own office as debtor to all, and is ever ready and watchful\r\nto raise the fallen, to support those who are falling, to embrace\r\nthose who return, to confirm the good and to carry them on to better\r\nthings. Hence, it can never forbear from witnessing to and proclaiming\r\nthe truth of God, which heals all things, knowing the words addressed\r\nto it: My Spirit that is in thee, and My words that I have put in thy\r\nmouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, from henceforth and for ever\r\n(Isaias lix. 21).\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, following the footsteps of our predecessors, have never\r\nceased, as becomes our supreme Apostolic office, from teaching and\r\ndefending Catholic truth, and condemning doctrines of error. And now,\r\nwith the Bishops of the whole world assembled round us and judging\r\nwith us, congregated by our authority and in the Holy Spirit in this\r\nOEcumenical Council, we, supported by the word of God written and\r\nhanded down, as we have received it from the Catholic Church, preserved\r\nwith sacredness and set forth according to truth--have determined to\r\nprofess and declare the salutary teaching of Christ from this chair of\r\nPeter, and in sight of all, proscribing and condemning, by the power\r\ngiven to us of God, all errors contrary thereto.\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. I. _Of God the Creator of all things._\r\n\r\nThe Holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church believes and confesses that\r\nthere is one true and living God, Creator and Lord of heaven and earth,\r\nAlmighty, Eternal, Immense, Incomprehensible, Infinite in intelligence,\r\nin will, and in all perfection, who, as being one, sole, absolutely\r\nsimple, and immutable spiritual substance, is to be declared as really\r\nand essentially distinct from the world, of supreme beatitude in and\r\nfrom Himself, and ineffably exalted above all things beside Himself\r\nwhich exist or are conceivable.\r\n\r\nThis one only true God, of His own goodness and almighty power, not\r\nfor the increase or acquirement of His own happiness, but to manifest\r\nHis perfection by the blessing which He bestows on creatures, and with\r\nabsolute freedom of counsel, created out of nothing, from the beginning\r\nof time, both the spiritual and the corporeal creature, to wit, the\r\nangelical and the mundane; and afterwards the human creature, as\r\npartaking, in a sense, of both, consisting of spirit and of body.[497]\r\n\r\nGod protects and governs by His Providence all things which He hath\r\nmade, \"reaching from end to end mightily, and ordering all things\r\nsweetly\" (Wisdom viii. 1). For \"all things are bare and open to His\r\neyes\" (Heb. iv. 13), even those which are yet to be by the free action\r\nof creatures.\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. II. _Of Revelation._\r\n\r\nThe same Holy Mother Church holds and teaches that God, the beginning\r\nand end of all things, may be certainly known by the natural light of\r\nhuman reason, by means of created things; \"for the invisible things of\r\nHim from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood\r\nby the things that are made\" (Romans i. 20): but that it pleased His\r\nwisdom and bounty to reveal Himself, and the eternal decrees of His\r\nwill, to mankind by another and supernatural way, as the Apostle says:\r\n\"God, having spoken on divers occasions, and many ways, in times past,\r\nto the fathers by the prophets; last of all, in these days, hath spoken\r\nto us by His Son\" (Hebrews i. 1, 2).\r\n\r\nIt is to be ascribed to this divine revelation, that such truths among\r\nthings divine as of themselves are not beyond human reason can, even in\r\nthe present condition of mankind, be known by every one with facility,\r\nwith firm assurance, and with no admixture of error. This, however, is\r\nnot the reason why revelation is to be called absolutely necessary; but\r\nbecause God of His infinite goodness has ordained man to a supernatural\r\nend, viz. to be a sharer of divine blessings which utterly exceed the\r\nintelligence of the human mind: for \"eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,\r\nneither hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath\r\nprepared for them that love Him\" (1 Cor. ii. 2).\r\n\r\nFurther, this supernatural revelation, according to the universal\r\nbelief of the Church, declared by the Sacred Synod of Trent, is\r\ncontained in the written books and unwritten traditions which, received\r\nby the Apostles from the mouth of Christ Himself, or by the Apostles\r\nthemselves, from the dictation of the Holy Spirit, transmitted, as\r\nit were, from hand to hand, have come down even unto us.[498] And\r\nthese books of the Old and New Testament are to be received as sacred\r\nand canonical, in their integrity, with all their parts, as they are\r\nenumerated in the decree of the said Council, and are contained in the\r\nancient Latin edition of the Vulgate. These the Church holds to be\r\nsacred and canonical: not because, having been carefully composed by\r\nmere human industry, they were afterwards approved by her authority;\r\nnor merely because they contain revelation, with no admixture of error;\r\nbut because, having been written by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost,\r\nthey have God for their author, and have been delivered as such to the\r\nChurch herself.\r\n\r\nAnd as the things which, in order to curb rebellious spirits, the\r\nHoly Synod of Trent decreed for the good of souls concerning the\r\ninterpretation of Divine Scripture, have been wrongly explained by\r\nsome, We, renewing the said decree, declare this to be its meaning:\r\nthat, in matters of faith and morals, appertaining to the building up\r\nof Christian doctrine, that is to be held as the true sense of Holy\r\nScripture which our Holy Mother Church hath held and holds, to whom\r\nit belongs to judge of the true sense and interpretation of the Holy\r\nScripture; and therefore that it is permitted to no one to interpret\r\nthe Sacred Scripture contrary to this sense, or, likewise, contrary to\r\nthe unanimous consent of the Fathers.\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. III. _On Faith._\r\n\r\nMan being wholly dependent upon God, as upon his Creator and Lord, and\r\ncreated reason being absolutely subject to uncreated truth, we are\r\nbound to yield to God, by faith in His revelation, the full obedience\r\nof our intelligence and will. And the Catholic Church teaches that this\r\nfaith, which is the beginning of man's salvation, is a supernatural\r\nvirtue, whereby, inspired and assisted by the grace of God, we believe\r\nthat the things which He has revealed are true: not because the\r\nintrinsic truth of the things is plainly perceived by the natural\r\nlight of reason, but because of the authority of God Himself who\r\nreveals them, and who can neither be deceived nor deceive. For faith,\r\nas the Apostle testifies, is \"the substance of things hoped for, the\r\nconviction of things that appear not\" (Hebrews xi. 1).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in order that the obedience of our faith might be in\r\nharmony with reason, God willed that to the interior help of the Holy\r\nSpirit there should be joined exterior proofs of His revelation: to\r\nwit, divine facts, and especially miracles and prophecies, which, as\r\nthey manifestly display the omnipotence and infinite knowledge of\r\nGod, are most certain proofs of His divine revelation, adapted to the\r\nintelligence of all men. Wherefore, both Moses and the Prophets, and\r\nmost especially Christ our Lord Himself, showed forth many and most\r\nevident miracles and prophecies; and of the Apostles we read: \"But\r\nthey going forth preached everywhere, the Lord working withal, and\r\nconfirming the word with signs that followed\" (Mark xvi. 20). And again\r\nit is written: \"We have the more firm prophetical word, whereunto you\r\ndo well to attend, as to a light shining in a dark place\" (2 St. Peter\r\ni. 19).\r\n\r\nBut though the assent of faith is by no means a blind action of the\r\nmind, still no man can assent to the Gospel teaching, as is necessary\r\nto obtain salvation, without the illumination and inspiration of\r\nthe Holy Spirit, who gives to all men sweetness in assenting to and\r\nbelieving in the truth.[499] Wherefore faith itself, even when it does\r\nnot work by charity, is in itself a gift of God, and the act of faith\r\nis a work appertaining to salvation, by which man yields voluntary\r\nobedience to God Himself, by assenting to and co-operating with His\r\ngrace, which he is able to resist.\r\n\r\nFurther, all those things are to be believed with divine and Catholic\r\nfaith which are contained in the Word of God, written or handed down,\r\nand which the Church, either by a solemn judgment or by her ordinary\r\nand universal teaching (_magisterium_), proposes for belief as having\r\nbeen divinely revealed.\r\n\r\nAnd since without faith it is impossible to please God, and to attain\r\nto the fellowship of His children, therefore without faith no one has\r\never attained justification; nor will any one obtain eternal life,\r\nunless he shall have persevered in faith unto the end. And, that we\r\nmay be able to satisfy the obligation of embracing the true faith and\r\nof constantly persevering in it, God has instituted the Church through\r\nHis only-begotten Son, and has bestowed on it manifest notes of that\r\ninstitution, that it may be recognized by all men as the guardian\r\nand teacher of the revealed Word; for to the Catholic Church alone\r\nbelong all those many and admirable tokens which have been divinely\r\nestablished for the evident credibility of the Christian Faith. Nay,\r\nmore, the Church by itself, by reason of its marvellous extension, its\r\neminent holiness, and its inexhaustible fruitfulness in every good\r\nthing, its Catholic unity and its invincible stability, is a great and\r\nperpetual motive of credibility, and an irrefutable witness of its own\r\ndivine mission.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, like a standard set up unto the nations (Isaias xi. 12),\r\nit both invites to itself those who do not yet believe, and assures\r\nits children that the faith which they profess rests on the most firm\r\nfoundation. And its testimony is efficaciously supported by a power\r\nfrom on high. For our most merciful Lord gives His grace to stir up and\r\nto aid those who are astray, that they may come to a knowledge of the\r\ntruth; and to those whom He has brought out of darkness into His own\r\nadmirable light, He gives His grace to strengthen them to persevere in\r\nthat light, deserting none who desert not Him. Therefore there is no\r\nparity between the condition of those who have adhered to the Catholic\r\ntruth by the heavenly gift of faith, and of those who, led by human\r\nopinions, follow a false religion; for those who have received the\r\nfaith under the teaching (_magisterio_) of the Church can never have\r\nany just cause for changing or doubting that faith. Therefore, giving\r\nthanks to God the Father who has made us worthy to be partakers of the\r\nlot of the Saints in light, let us not neglect so great salvation, but\r\nwith our eyes fixed on Jesus, the author and finisher of our Faith, let\r\nus hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering (Hebrews xii.\r\n2; and x. 23).\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. IV. _Of Faith and Reason._\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Church with one consent has also ever held and does hold\r\nthat there is a twofold order of knowledge, distinct both in principle\r\nand in object: in principle, because our knowledge in the one is by\r\nnatural reason, and in the other by divine faith; in object, because,\r\nbesides those things to which natural reason can attain, there are\r\nproposed to our belief mysteries hidden in God, which, unless divinely\r\nrevealed, cannot be known. Wherefore the Apostle, who testifies that\r\nGod is known by the Gentiles through created things, still, when\r\ndiscoursing of the grace and truth which come by Jesus Christ (John i.\r\n17), says: \"We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, a wisdom which\r\nis hidden, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: which\r\nnone of the princes of this world knew; ... but to us God hath revealed\r\nthem by His Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep\r\nthings of God\" (1 Cor. ii. 7-9). And the only-begotten Son Himself\r\ngives thanks to the Father, because He has hid these things from the\r\nwise and prudent, and has revealed them to little ones (Matt. xi. 25).\r\n\r\nReason, indeed, enlightened by faith, when it seeks earnestly, piously,\r\nand calmly, attains by a gift from God some, and that a very fruitful,\r\nunderstanding of mysteries; partly from the analogy of those things\r\nwhich it naturally knows, partly from the relations which the mysteries\r\nbear to one another and to the last end of man: but reason never\r\nbecomes capable of apprehending mysteries as it does those truths\r\nwhich constitute its proper object. For the divine mysteries by their\r\nown nature so far transcend the created intelligence that, even when\r\ndelivered by revelation and received by faith, they remain covered with\r\nthe veil of faith itself, and shrouded in a certain degree of darkness,\r\nso long as we are pilgrims in this mortal life, not yet with God; \"for\r\nwe walk by faith and not by sight\" (2 Cor. v. 7).\r\n\r\nBut although faith is above reason, there can never be any real\r\ndiscrepancy between faith and reason; since the same God who reveals\r\nmysteries and infuses faith has bestowed the light of reason on the\r\nhuman mind, and God cannot deny Himself, nor can truth ever contradict\r\ntruth. The false appearance of such a contradiction is mainly\r\ndue, either to the dogmas of faith not having been understood and\r\nexpounded according to the mind of the Church, or to the inventions\r\nof opinion having been taken for the verdicts of reason. We define,\r\ntherefore, that every assertion contrary to a truth of enlightened\r\nfaith is utterly false.[500] Further, the Church, which, together\r\nwith the Apostolic office of teaching, has received a charge to guard\r\nthe deposit of faith, derives from God the right and the duty of\r\nproscribing false science, lest any should be deceived by philosophy\r\nand vain fallacy (Col. ii. 8). Therefore all faithful Christians are\r\nnot only forbidden to defend, as legitimate conclusions of science,\r\nsuch opinions as are known to be contrary to the doctrines of faith,\r\nespecially if they have been condemned by the Church, but are\r\naltogether bound to account them as errors which put on the fallacious\r\nappearance of truth.\r\n\r\nAnd not only can faith and reason never be opposed to one another, but\r\nthey are of mutual aid one to the other: for right reason demonstrates\r\nthe foundations of faith, and, enlightened by its light, cultivates\r\nthe science of things divine; while faith frees and guards reason from\r\nerrors, and furnishes it with manifold knowledge. So far, therefore, is\r\nthe Church from opposing the cultivation of human arts and sciences,\r\nthat it in many ways helps and promotes it. For the Church neither\r\nignores nor despises the benefits to human life which result from the\r\narts and sciences, but confesses that, as they came from God, the\r\nLord of all science, so, if they be rightly used, they lead to God by\r\nthe help of His grace. Nor does the Church forbid that each of these\r\nsciences in its sphere should make use of its own principles and\r\nits own method; but, while recognizing this just liberty, it stands\r\nwatchfully on guard, lest sciences, setting themselves against the\r\ndivine teaching, or transgressing their own limits, should invade and\r\ndisturb the domain of faith.\r\n\r\nFor the doctrine of faith which God hath revealed has not been\r\nproposed, like a philosophical invention, to be perfected by human\r\ningenuity; but has been delivered as a divine deposit to the Spouse\r\nof Christ, to be faithfully kept and infallibly declared. Hence also,\r\nthat meaning of the sacred dogmas is perpetually to be retained which\r\nour Holy Mother the Church has once declared; nor is that meaning\r\never to be departed from, under the pretence or pretext of a deeper\r\ncomprehension of them. Let, then, the intelligence, science, and wisdom\r\nof each and all, of individuals and of the whole Church, in all ages\r\nand all times, increase and flourish in abundance and vigour; but\r\nsimply in its own proper kind, that is to say, in one and the same\r\ndoctrine, one and the same sense, one and the same judgment (Vincent of\r\nLerins, _Common_. n. 28).\r\n\r\n\r\nCANONS.\r\n\r\nI. _Of God the Creator of all things._\r\n\r\n1.

If any one confess not that the world, and all things which are\r\ncontained in it, both spiritual and material, have been, in their\r\nwhole substance, produced by God out of nothing; or shall say that God\r\ncreated, not by His will, free from all necessity, but by a necessity\r\nequal to the necessity whereby He loves Himself; or shall deny that the\r\nworld was made for the glory of God; let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Of Revelation._\r\n\r\n1. If anyone shall say that the One true God, our Creator and Lord,\r\ncannot be certainly known by the natural light of human reason, through\r\ncreated things; let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n2.

If any one shall not receive as sacred and canonical the Books of\r\nHoly Scripture, entire with all their parts, as the Holy Synod of\r\nTrent has enumerated them, or shall deny that they have been divinely\r\ninspired; let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Of Faith._\r\n\r\n1. If any one shall say that human reason is so independent that faith\r\ncannot be enjoined upon it by God; let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n2. If any one shall say that divine faith is not distinguished from\r\nnatural knowledge of God and of moral truths, and therefore that it is\r\nnot requisite for divine faith that revealed truth be believed because\r\nof the authority of God who reveals it; let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n3. If any one shall say that divine revelation cannot be made credible\r\nby outward signs, and therefore that men ought to be moved to faith\r\nsolely by the internal experience of each, or by private inspiration;\r\nlet him be anathema.\r\n\r\n4. If any one shall say that miracles are impossible, and therefore\r\nthat all the accounts regarding them, even those contained in Holy\r\nScripture, are to be dismissed as fabulous or mythical; or that\r\nmiracles can never be known with certainty, and that the divine origin\r\nof Christianity is not rightly proved by them; let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n5. If any one shall say that the assent of Christian faith is not a\r\nfree act, but necessarily produced by the arguments of human reason;\r\nor that the grace of God is necessary for that living faith only which\r\nworketh by charity; let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n6. If any one shall say that the condition of the faithful, and of\r\nthose who have not yet attained to the only true faith, is on a par,\r\nso that Catholics may have just cause for doubting, with suspended\r\nassent, the faith which they have already received under the teaching\r\n(_magisterio_) of the Church, until they shall have obtained a\r\nscientific demonstration of the credibility and truth of their faith;\r\nlet him be anathema.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _Of Faith and Reason._\r\n\r\n1. If any one shall say that in divine revelation there are no\r\nmysteries, truly and properly so called, but that all the doctrines of\r\nfaith can be understood and demonstrated from natural principles by\r\nproperly cultivated reason; let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n2. If any one shall say that human sciences are to be so freely\r\ntreated, that their assertions, although opposed to revealed doctrine,\r\ncan be held as true, and cannot be condemned by the Church; let him be\r\nanathema.\r\n\r\n3. If any one shall assert it to be possible that sometimes, according\r\nto the progress of science, a sense is to be given to doctrines\r\npropounded by the Church different from that which the Church has\r\nunderstood and understands; let him be anathema.\r\n\r\nTherefore We, fulfilling the duty of our supreme pastoral office,\r\nentreat by the mercies of Jesus Christ, and, by the authority of the\r\nsame our God and Saviour, We command, all the faithful of Christ, and\r\nespecially those who are set over others or are charged with the office\r\nof instruction, that they earnestly and diligently apply themselves to\r\nward off and eliminate these errors from Holy Church, and to spread the\r\nlight of pure faith.\r\n\r\nAnd since it is not sufficient to shun heretical pravity, unless\r\nthose errors also be diligently avoided which more or less nearly\r\napproach it. We admonish all men of the further duty of observing the\r\nConstitutions and Decrees by which such erroneous opinions as are not\r\nhere expressly enumerated have been proscribed and condemned by this\r\nHoly See.\r\n\r\nGiven at Rome in Public Session, solemnly held in the Vatican Basilica\r\nin the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy, on\r\nthe twenty-fourth day of April, in the twenty-fourth year of our\r\nPontificate.\r\n\r\n _In conformity with the original_,\r\n\r\n JOSEPH, _Bishop of St. Polten_,\r\n\r\n _Secretary of the Vatican Council._\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST DOGMATIC CONSTITUTION ON THE CHURCH OF CHRIST.\r\n\r\nPius Bishop, Servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the\r\nSacred Council, for perpetual remembrance.\r\n\r\nThe Eternal Pastor and Bishop of our souls, in order to continue for\r\nall time the life-giving work of His Redemption, determined to build\r\nup the Holy Church, wherein, as in the House of the living God, all\r\nwho believe might be united in the bond of one faith and one charity.\r\nWherefore, before He entered into His glory, He prayed unto the Father,\r\nnot for the Apostles only, but for those also who through their\r\npreaching should come to believe in Him, that all might be one, even\r\nas He the Son and the Father are one (St. John xvii. 21). As then He\r\nsent the Apostles whom He had chosen to Himself from the world, as He\r\nHimself had been sent by the Father; so He willed that there should\r\never be pastors and teachers in His Church to the end of the world.\r\nAnd in order that the Episcopate also might be one and undivided, and\r\nthat by means of a closely united priesthood the multitude of the\r\nfaithful might be kept secure in the oneness of faith and communion,\r\nHe set Blessed Peter over the rest of the Apostles, and fixed in\r\nhim the abiding principle of this two-fold unity and its visible\r\nfoundation, in the strength of which the everlasting temple should\r\narise, and the Church in the firmness of that faith should lift her\r\nmajestic front to heaven.[501] And seeing that the gates of hell with\r\ndaily increase of hatred are gathering their strength on every side to\r\nupheave the foundation laid by God's own hand, and so, if that might\r\nbe, to overthrow the Church: We, therefore, for the preservation, safe\r\nkeeping, and increase of the Catholic flock, with the approval of the\r\nSacred Council, do judge it to be necessary to propose to the belief\r\nand acceptance of all the faithful, in accordance with the ancient\r\nand constant faith of the universal Church, the doctrine touching the\r\ninstitution, perpetuity, and nature of the sacred Apostolic Primacy, in\r\nwhich is found the strength and solidity of the entire Church; and at\r\nthe same time to proscribe and condemn the contrary errors, so hurtful\r\nto the flock of Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. I. _Of the Institution of the Apostolic Primacy in Blessed Peter._\r\n\r\nWe therefore teach and declare that, according to the testimony of the\r\nGospel, the primacy of jurisdiction over the universal Church of God\r\nwas immediately and directly promised and given to Blessed Peter the\r\nApostle by Christ the Lord. For it was to Simon alone, to whom He had\r\nalready said, \"Thou shalt be called Cephas\" (St. John i. 42), that the\r\nLord, after the confession made by him, saying, \"Thou art the Christ,\r\nthe Son of the living God,\" addressed these solemn words: \"Blessed art\r\nthou, Simon Bar-Jona, because flesh and blood have not revealed it to\r\nthee, but My Father who is in heaven. And I say to thee that thou art\r\nPeter, and upon this rock I will build My Church; and the gates of hell\r\nshall not prevail against it. And I will give to thee the keys of the\r\nkingdom of heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall\r\nbe bound also in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, it\r\nshall be loosed in heaven\" (St. Matthew xvi. 16-19). And it was upon\r\nSimon alone that Jesus after His resurrection bestowed the jurisdiction\r\nof Chief Pastor and Ruler over all His fold in the words: \"Feed My\r\nlambs; feed My sheep\" (St. John xxi. 15-17). At open variance with\r\nthis clear doctrine of Holy Scripture, as it has been ever understood\r\nby the Catholic Church, are the perverse opinions of those who, while\r\nthey distort the form of government established by Christ the Lord in\r\nHis Church, deny that Peter in his single person, preferably to all the\r\nother Apostles, whether taken separately or together, was endowed by\r\nChrist with a true and proper primacy of jurisdiction; or of those who\r\nassert that the same primacy was not bestowed immediately and directly\r\nupon Blessed Peter himself, but upon the Church, and through the Church\r\non Peter as her minister.\r\n\r\nIf any one, therefore, shall say that Blessed Peter the Apostle was\r\nnot appointed the Prince of all the Apostles and the visible Head of\r\nthe whole Church Militant; or that the same directly and immediately\r\nreceived from the same our Lord Jesus Christ a primacy of honour only,\r\nand not of true and proper jurisdiction; let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. II. _On the Perpetuity of the Primacy of Blessed Peter in the\r\nRoman Pontiffs._\r\n\r\nThat which the Prince of Shepherds and Great Shepherd of the sheep,\r\nJesus Christ our Lord, established in the person of the Blessed Apostle\r\nPeter, to secure the perpetual welfare and lasting good of the Church,\r\nmust, by the same institution, necessarily remain unceasingly in the\r\nChurch; which, being founded upon the Rock, will stand firm to the end\r\nof the world. For none can doubt, and it is known to all ages, that\r\nthe holy and Blessed Peter, the Prince and Chief of the Apostles, the\r\npillar of the faith and foundation of the Catholic Church, received\r\nthe keys of the kingdom from our Lord Jesus Christ, the Saviour and\r\nRedeemer of mankind, and lives, presides, and judges, to this day\r\nand always, in his successors the Bishops of the Holy See of Rome,\r\nwhich was founded by him, and consecrated by his blood.[502] Whence,\r\nwhosoever succeeds to Peter in this See does by the institution of\r\nChrist Himself obtain the Primacy of Peter over the whole Church.\r\nThis disposition made by Incarnate Truth (_dispositio veritatis_)\r\ntherefore remains, and Blessed Peter abiding in the rock strength which\r\nhe received (_in acceptâ fortitudine petræâ perseverans_), has not\r\nabandoned the direction of the Church.[503] Wherefore it has at all\r\ntimes been necessary that every particular Church--that is to say, the\r\nfaithful throughout the world--should come to the Church of Rome, on\r\naccount of the greater princedom it has received; so that in this See,\r\nwhence the rights of venerable communion spread to all, they might, as\r\nmembers joined together in their head, grow closely into one body.[504]\r\n\r\nIf, then, one shall say that it is not by the institution of Christ the\r\nLord, or by divine right, that Blessed Peter has a perpetual line of\r\nsuccessors in the primacy over the universal Church; or that the Roman\r\nPontiff is not the successor of Blessed Peter in this primacy; let him\r\nbe anathema.\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. III. _On the Power and Nature of the Primacy of the Roman\r\nPontiff._\r\n\r\nWherefore, resting on plain testimonies of the Sacred Writings, and\r\nadhering to the plain and express decrees both of our predecessors the\r\nRoman Pontiffs, and of the General Councils, We renew the definition\r\nof the OEcumenical Council of Florence, by which all the faithful of\r\nChrist must believe that the Holy Apostolic See and the Roman Pontiff\r\npossesses the primacy over the whole world; and that the Roman Pontiff\r\nis the successor of Blessed Peter, Prince of the Apostles, and is\r\ntrue Vicar of Christ, and Head of the whole Church, and Father and\r\nTeacher of all Christians; and that full power was given to him in\r\nBlessed Peter, by Jesus Christ our Lord, to rule, feed, and govern the\r\nUniversal Church: as is also contained in the Acts of the OEcumenical\r\nCouncils and in the Sacred Canons.\r\n\r\nHence we teach and declare, that by the appointment of our Lord the\r\nRoman Church possesses a sovereignty of ordinary power over all other\r\nChurches, and that this power of jurisdiction of the Roman Pontiff,\r\nwhich is truly episcopal, is immediate; to which all, of whatever\r\nrite and dignity, both pastors and faithful, both individually and\r\ncollectively, are bound, by their duty of hierarchical subordination\r\nand true obedience, to submit, not only in matters which belong to\r\nfaith and morals, but also in those that appertain to the discipline\r\nand government of the Church throughout the world; so that the Church\r\nof Christ may be one flock under one supreme Pastor, through the\r\npreservation of unity, both of communion and of profession of the same\r\nfaith, with the Roman Pontiff. This is the teaching of Catholic truth,\r\nfrom which no one can deviate without loss of faith and of salvation.\r\n\r\nBut so far is this power of the Supreme Pontiff from being any\r\nprejudice to that ordinary and immediate power of episcopal\r\njurisdiction, by which Bishops, who have been set by the Holy Ghost to\r\nsucceed and hold the place of the Apostles,[505] feed and govern each\r\nhis own flock as true pastors, that this same power is really asserted,\r\nstrengthened, and protected by the supreme and universal Pastor; in\r\naccordance with the words of St. Gregory the Great: \"My honour is\r\nthe honour of the whole Church. My honour is the firm strength of my\r\nbrethren. Then am I truly honoured, when the honour due to each and\r\nall is not withheld.\"[506]\r\n\r\nFurther, from this supreme power possessed by the Roman Pontiff of\r\ngoverning the universal Church, it follows that, in the exercise of\r\nthis office, he has the right of free communication with the pastors\r\nof the whole Church, and with their flocks, that they may be taught\r\nand ruled by him in the way of salvation. Wherefore We condemn and\r\nreprobate the opinions of those who hold that the communication between\r\nthe supreme Head and the pastors and their flocks can lawfully be\r\nimpeded; or who make this communication subject to the will of the\r\nsecular power, so as to maintain that whatever is done by the Apostolic\r\nSee, or by its authority, for the government of the Church, cannot have\r\nforce or value unless it be confirmed by the assent of the secular\r\npower. And since, by the divine right of Apostolic primacy, the Roman\r\nPontiff is placed over the universal Church, We further teach and\r\ndeclare that he is the supreme judge of the faithful,[507] and that in\r\nall causes the decision of which belongs to the Church recourse may be\r\nhad to his tribunal;[508] but that none may re-open the judgment of the\r\nApostolic See, than whose authority there is no greater, nor can any\r\nlawfully review its judgment.[509] Wherefore they err from the right\r\npath of truth who assert that it is lawful to appeal from the judgments\r\nof the Roman Pontiffs to an OEcumenical Council, as to an authority\r\nhigher than that of the Roman Pontiff.\r\n\r\nIf then any shall say that the Roman Pontiff has the office merely of\r\ninspection or direction, and not full and supreme power of jurisdiction\r\nover the universal Church, not only in things which belong to faith\r\nand morals, but also in those which relate to the discipline and\r\ngovernment of the Church spread throughout the world; or assert that he\r\npossesses merely the principal part, and not all the fulness of this\r\nsupreme power; or that this power which he enjoys is not ordinary and\r\nimmediate, both over each and all the Churches, and over each and all\r\nthe pastors and the faithful; let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. IV. _Concerning the Infallible Teaching of the Roman Pontiff._\r\n\r\nMoreover, that the supreme power of teaching (_magisterii_) is also\r\nincluded in the Apostolic primacy, which the Roman Pontiff, as the\r\nsuccessor of Peter, Prince of the Apostles, possesses over the whole\r\nChurch, this Holy See has always held, the perpetual practice of\r\nthe Church confirms, and OEcumenical Councils also have declared,\r\nespecially those in which the East with the West met in the union\r\nof faith and charity. For the Fathers of the Fourth Council of\r\nConstantinople, following in the footsteps of their predecessors, gave\r\nforth this solemn profession: The first condition of salvation is to\r\nkeep the rule of the true faith. And because the sentence of our Lord\r\nJesus Christ cannot be passed by, who said, \"Thou art Peter, and upon\r\nthis Rock I will build My Church\" (St. Matthew xvi. 18), these things\r\nwhich have been said are proved by events, because in the Apostolic See\r\nthe Catholic religion has always been kept undefined and her well-known\r\ndoctrine has been kept holy. Desiring, therefore, not to be in the\r\nleast degree separated from the faith and doctrine of this See, we hope\r\nthat we may deserve to be in the one communion, which the Apostolic See\r\npreaches, in which is the entire and true solidity of the Christian\r\nreligion.[510] And with the approval of the Second Council of Lyons,\r\nthe Greeks professed: That the Holy Roman Church enjoys supreme and\r\nfull Primacy and princedom over the whole Catholic Church, which it\r\ntruly and humbly acknowledges that it has received with the plenitude\r\nof power from our Lord Himself in the person of Blessed Peter, Prince\r\nor Head of the Apostles, whose successor the Roman Pontiff is; and as\r\nthe Apostolic See is bound before all others to defend the truth of\r\nfaith, so also, if any questions regarding faith shall arise, they\r\nmust be defined by its judgment.[511] Finally, the Council of Florence\r\ndefined:[512] That the Roman Pontiff is the true Vicar of Christ,\r\nand the Head of the whole Church, and the Father and Teacher of all\r\nChristians; and that to him in Blessed Peter was delivered by our Lord\r\nJesus Christ the full power of feeding, ruling, and governing the whole\r\nChurch (John xxi. 15-17).\r\n\r\nTo satisfy this pastoral duty, our predecessors ever made unwearied\r\nefforts that the salutary doctrine of Christ might be propagated among\r\nall the nations of the earth, and with equal care watched that it might\r\nbe preserved genuine and pure where it had been received. Therefore\r\nthe Bishops of the whole world, now singly, now assembled in synod,\r\nfollowing the long-established custom of Churches[513] and the form of\r\nthe ancient rule,[514] sent word to this Apostolic See of those dangers\r\nespecially which sprang up in matters of faith, that there the losses\r\nof faith might be most effectually repaired where the faith cannot\r\nfail.[515] And the Roman Pontiffs, according to the exigencies of times\r\nand circumstances, sometimes assembling OEcumenical Councils, or asking\r\nfor the mind of the Church scattered throughout the world, sometimes by\r\nparticular Synods, sometimes using other helps which Divine Providence\r\nsupplied, defined as to be held those things which with the help of\r\nGod they had recognized as conformable with the Sacred Scriptures and\r\nApostolic Traditions. For the Holy Spirit was not promised to the\r\nsuccessors of Peter, that by His revelation they might make known new\r\ndoctrine, but that by His assistance they might inviolably keep and\r\nfaithfully expound the revelation or deposit of faith delivered through\r\nthe Apostles. And indeed all the venerable Fathers have embraced and\r\nthe holy orthodox Doctors have venerated and followed their Apostolic\r\ndoctrine; knowing most fully that this See of Saint Peter remains ever\r\nfree from all blemish of error according to the divine promise of the\r\nLord our Saviour made to the Prince of His disciples: \"I have prayed\r\nfor thee that thy faith fail not, and when thou art converted, confirm\r\nthy brethren\" (St. Luke xxii. 32).[516]\r\n\r\nThis gift, then, of truth and never-failing faith, was conferred by\r\nHeaven upon Peter and his successors in this Chair, that they might\r\nperform their high office for the salvation of all; that the whole\r\nflock of Christ, kept away by them from the poisonous food of error,\r\nmight be nourished with the pasture of heavenly doctrine; that, the\r\noccasion of schism being removed, the whole Church might be kept one,\r\nand, resting on its foundation, might stand firm against the gates of\r\nhell.\r\n\r\nBut since in this very age, in which the salutary efficacy of the\r\nApostolic office is most of all required, not a few are found who take\r\naway from its authority, we judge it altogether necessary solemnly to\r\nassert the prerogative which the only-begotten Son of God vouchsafed to\r\njoin with the supreme pastoral office.\r\n\r\nTherefore, faithfully adhering to the tradition received from the\r\nbeginning of the Christian faith, for the glory of God our Saviour, the\r\nexaltation of the Catholic Religion, and the salvation of Christian\r\npeople, with the approval of the Sacred Council, We teach and define\r\nthat it is a dogma divinely revealed: That the Roman Pontiff, when\r\nhe speaks _ex cathedrâ_, that is, when in discharge of the office\r\nof Pastor and Teacher of all Christians, by virtue of his supreme\r\nApostolic authority, he defines a doctrine regarding faith or morals to\r\nbe held by the universal Church, is, by the divine assistance promised\r\nto Him in Blessed Peter, possessed of that infallibility with which the\r\ndivine Redeemer willed that His Church should be endowed in defining\r\ndoctrine regarding faith or morals; and that therefore such definitions\r\nof the Roman Pontiff are of themselves, and not from the consent of the\r\nChurch, irreformable.[517]\r\n\r\nBut if any one, which may God avert! presume to contradict this our\r\nDefinition; let him be anathema.\r\n\r\nGiven at Rome in Public Session, solemnly held in the Vatican Basilica\r\nin the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy, on the\r\neighteenth day of July, in the twenty-fifth year of our Pontificate.\r\n\r\n _In conformity with the original_,\r\n\r\n JOSEPH, _Bishop of St. Polten_,\r\n\r\n _Secretary to the Vatican Council_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 497: Fourth Lateran Council, cap. i. de fide Catholica.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 498: Council of Trent, sess. iv. de Can.

The Pope took particular notice of a\r\n    little boy, six years old, the child of Mr. William Hutchinson, a\r\n    graduate of Oxford. The child was dressed as a Pontifical Switzer,\r\n    and offered the military salute. The Pope smilingly took hold of\r\n    his _baton_, and said, 'Where is your halberd, Switzer?' To which\r\n    the child spiritedly said, 'Holy Father, I hope if God gives me\r\n    health when I grow up to carry your Holiness's banner.' The Pope,\r\n    stooping down, and imitating the beating of a drum with his hand,\r\n    said it was necessary to begin by beating the drum, and added, 'God\r\n    bless you, Switzer, and preserve you to defend the Holy See in His\r\n    own good time.' He addressed some affectionate words to the parents\r\n    and all present.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Acclamation, Acton on, 83;\r\n    Plantier on, 204;\r\n    fears of, at first
