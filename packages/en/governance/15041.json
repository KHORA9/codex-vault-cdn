WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nPrincipal of Tuskegee Institute\r\n\r\n  The necessity for the race's learning the difference between being\r\n  worked and working. He would not confine the Negro to industrial life,\r\n  but believes that the very best service which any one can render to what\r\n  is called the \"higher education\" is to teach the present generation to\r\n  work and save. This will create the wealth from which alone can come\r\n  leisure and the opportunity for higher education.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most fundamental and far-reaching deeds that has been\r\naccomplished during the last quarter of a century has been that by which\r\nthe Negro has been helped to find himself and to learn the secrets of\r\ncivilization--to learn that there are a few simple, cardinal principles\r\nupon which a race must start its upward course, unless it would fail, and\r\nits last estate be worse than its first.\r\n\r\nIt has been necessary for the Negro to learn the difference between being\r\nworked and working--to learn that being worked meant degradation, while\r\nworking means civilization; that all forms of labor are honorable, and all\r\nforms of idleness disgraceful. It has been necessary for him to learn that\r\nall races that have got upon their feet have done so largely by laying an\r\neconomic foundation, and, in general, by beginning in a proper cultivation\r\nand ownership of the soil.\r\n\r\nForty years ago my race emerged from slavery into freedom. If, in too many\r\ncases, the Negro race began development at the wrong end, it was largely\r\nbecause neither white nor black properly understood the case. Nor is it\r\nany wonder that this was so, for never before in the history of the world\r\nhad just such a problem been presented as that of the two races at the\r\ncoming of freedom in this country.\r\n\r\nFor two hundred and fifty years, I believe the way for the redemption of\r\nthe Negro was being prepared through industrial development. Through all\r\nthose years the Southern white man did business with the Negro in a way\r\nthat no one else has done business with him. In most cases if a Southern\r\nwhite man wanted a house built he consulted a Negro mechanic about the\r\nplan and about the actual building of the structure. If he wanted a suit\r\nof clothes made he went to a Negro tailor, and for shoes he went to a\r\nshoemaker of the same race. In a certain way every slave plantation in the\r\nSouth was an industrial school. On these plantations young colored men and\r\nwomen were constantly being trained not only as farmers but as carpenters,\r\nblacksmiths, wheelwrights, brick masons, engineers, cooks, laundresses,\r\nsewing women and housekeepers.\r\n\r\nI do not mean in any way to apologize for the curse of slavery, which was\r\na curse to both races, but in what I say about industrial training in\r\nslavery I am simply stating facts. This training was crude, and was given\r\nfor selfish purposes. It did not answer the highest ends, because there\r\nwas an absence of mental training in connection with the training of the\r\nhand. To a large degree, though, this business contact with the Southern\r\nwhite man, and the industrial training on the plantations, left the Negro\r\nat the close of the war in possession of nearly all the common and skilled\r\nlabor in the South. The industries that gave the South its power,\r\nprominence and wealth prior to the Civil War were mainly the raising of\r\ncotton, sugar cane, rice and tobacco. Before the way could be prepared for\r\nthe proper growing and marketing of these crops forests had to be cleared,\r\nhouses to be built, public roads and railroads constructed. In all these\r\nworks the Negro did most of the heavy work. In the planting, cultivating\r\nand marketing of the crops not only was the Negro the chief dependence,\r\nbut in the manufacture of tobacco he became a skilled and proficient\r\nworkman, and in this, up to the present time, in the South, holds the lead\r\nin the large tobacco manufactories.\r\n\r\nIn most of the industries, though, what happened? For nearly twenty years\r\nafter the war, except in a few instances, the value of the industrial\r\ntraining given by the plantations was overlooked. Negro men and women were\r\neducated in literature, in mathematics and in the sciences, with little\r\nthought of what had been taking place during the preceding two hundred and\r\nfifty years, except, perhaps, as something to be escaped, to be got as\r\nfar away from as possible. As a generation began to pass, those who had\r\nbeen trained as mechanics in slavery began to disappear by death, and\r\ngradually it began to be realized that there were few to take their\r\nplaces. There were young men educated in foreign tongues, but few in\r\ncarpentry or in mechanical or architectural drawing. Many were trained in\r\nLatin, but few as engineers and blacksmiths. Too many were taken from the\r\nfarm and educated, but educated in everything but farming. For this reason\r\nthey had no interest in farming and did not return to it. And yet\r\neighty-five per cent. of the Negro population of the Southern states lives\r\nand for a considerable time will continue to live in the country\r\ndistricts. The charge is often brought against the members of my race--and\r\ntoo often justly, I confess--that they are found leaving the country\r\ndistricts and flocking into the great cities where temptations are more\r\nfrequent and harder to resist, and where the Negro people too often become\r\ndemoralized. Think, though, how frequently it is the case that from the\r\nfirst day that a pupil begins to go to school his books teach him much\r\nabout the cities of the world and city life, and almost nothing about the\r\ncountry. How natural it is, then, that when he has the ordering of his\r\nlife he wants to live it in the city.\r\n\r\nOnly a short time before his death the late Mr. C.P. Huntington, to whose\r\nmemory a magnificent library has just been given by his widow to the\r\nHampton Institute for Negroes, in Virginia, said in a public address some\r\nwords which seem to me so wise that I want to quote them here:\r\n\r\n\"Our schools teach everybody a little of almost everything, but, in my\r\nopinion, they teach very few children just what they ought to know in\r\norder to make their way successfully in life. They do not put into their\r\nhands the tools they are best fitted to use, and hence so many failures.\r\nMany a mother and sister have worked and slaved, living upon scanty food,\r\nin order to give a son and brother a \"liberal education,\" and in doing\r\nthis have built up a barrier between the boy and the work he was fitted to\r\ndo. Let me say to you that all honest work is honorable work. If the labor\r\nis manual, and seems common, you will have all the more chance to be\r\nthinking of other things, or of work that is higher and brings better pay,\r\nand to work out in your minds better and higher duties and\r\nresponsibilities for yourselves, and for thinking of ways by which you can\r\nhelp others as well as yourselves, and bring them up to your own higher\r\nlevel.\"\r\n\r\nSome years ago, when we decided to make tailoring a part of our training\r\nat the Tuskegee Institute, I was amazed to find that it was almost\r\nimpossible to find in the whole country an educated colored man who could\r\nteach the making of clothing. We could find numbers of them who could\r\nteach astronomy, theology, Latin or grammar, but almost none who could\r\ninstruct in the making of clothing, something that has to be used by every\r\none of us every day in the year. How often have I been discouraged as I\r\nhave gone through the South, and into the homes of the people of my race,\r\nand have found women who could converse intelligently upon abstruse\r\nsubjects, and yet could not tell how to improve the condition of the\r\npoorly cooked and still more poorly served bread and meat which they and\r\ntheir families were eating three times a day. It is discouraging to find a\r\ngirl who can tell you the geographical location of any country on the\r\nglobe and who does not know where to place the dishes upon a common dinner\r\ntable. It is discouraging to find a woman who knows much about theoretical\r\nchemistry, and who cannot properly wash and iron a shirt.\r\n\r\nIn what I say here I would not by any means have it understood that I\r\nwould limit or circumscribe the mental development of the Negro-student.\r\nNo race can be lifted until its mind is awakened and strengthened. By the\r\nside of industrial training should always go mental and moral training,\r\nbut the pushing of mere abstract knowledge into the head means little. We\r\nwant more than the mere performance of mental gymnastics. Our knowledge\r\nmust be harnessed to the things of real life. I would encourage the Negro\r\nto secure all the mental strength, all the mental culture--whether gleaned\r\nfrom science, mathematics, history, language or literature that his\r\ncircumstances will allow, but I believe most earnestly that for years to\r\ncome the education of the people of my race should be so directed that the\r\ngreatest proportion of the mental strength of the masses will be brought\r\nto bear upon the every-day practical things of life, upon something that\r\nis needed to be done, and something which they will be permitted to do in\r\nthe community in which they reside. And just the same with the\r\nprofessional class which the race needs and must have, I would say give\r\nthe men and women of that class, too, the training which will best fit\r\nthem to perform in the most successful manner the service which the race\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\nI would not confine the race to industrial life, not even to agriculture,\r\nfor example, although I believe that by far the greater part of the Negro\r\nrace is best off in the country districts and must and should continue to\r\nlive there, but I would teach the race that in industry the foundation\r\nmust be laid--that the very best service which any one can render to what\r\nis called the higher education is to teach the present generation to\r\nprovide a material or industrial foundation. On such a foundation as this\r\nwill grow habits of thrift, a love of work, economy, ownership of\r\nproperty, bank accounts. Out of it in the future will grow practical\r\neducation, professional education, positions of public responsibility. Out\r\nof it will grow moral and religious strength. Out of it will grow wealth\r\nfrom which alone can come leisure and the opportunity for the enjoyment of\r\nliterature and the fine arts.\r\n\r\nIn the words of the late beloved Frederick Douglass: \"Every blow of the\r\nsledge hammer wielded by a sable arm is a powerful blow in support of our\r\ncause. Every colored mechanic is by virtue of circumstances an elevator of\r\nhis race. Every house built by a black man is a strong tower against the\r\nallied hosts of prejudice. It is impossible for us to attach too much\r\nimportance to this aspect of the subject. Without industrial development\r\nthere can be no wealth; without wealth there can be no leisure; without\r\nleisure no opportunity for thoughtful reflection and the cultivation of\r\nthe higher arts.\"\r\n\r\nI would set no limits to the attainments of the Negro in arts, in letters\r\nor statesmanship, but I believe the surest way to reach those ends is by\r\nlaying the foundation in the little things of life that lie immediately\r\nabout one's door. I plead for industrial education and development for the\r\nNegro not because I want to cramp him, but because I want to free him. I\r\nwant to see him enter the all-powerful business and commercial world.\r\n\r\nIt was such combined mental, moral and industrial education which the late\r\nGeneral Armstrong set out to give at the Hampton Institute when he\r\nestablished that school thirty years ago. The Hampton Institute has\r\ncontinued along the lines laid down by its great founder, and now each\r\nyear an increasing number of similar schools are being established in the\r\nSouth, for the people of both races.\r\n\r\nEarly in the history of the Tuskegee Institute we began to combine\r\nindustrial training with mental and moral culture. Our first efforts were\r\nin the direction of agriculture, and we began teaching this with no\r\nappliances except one hoe and a blind mule. From this small beginning we\r\nhave grown until now the Institute owns two thousand acres of land, eight\r\nhundred of which are cultivated each year by the young men of the school.\r\nWe began teaching wheelwrighting and blacksmithing in a small way to the\r\nmen, and laundry work, cooking and sewing and housekeeping to the young\r\nwomen. The fourteen hundred and over young men and women who attended the\r\nschool during the last school year received instruction--in addition to\r\nacademic and religious training--in thirty-three trades and industries,\r\nincluding carpentry, blacksmithing, printing, wheelwrighting\r\nharnessmaking, painting, machinery, founding, shoemaking, brickmasonry and\r\nbrickmaking, plastering, sawmilling, tinsmithing, tailoring, mechanical\r\nand architectural drawing, electrical and steam engineering, canning,\r\nsewing, dressmaking, millinery, cooking, laundering, housekeeping,\r\nmattress making, basketry, nursing, agriculture, dairying and stock\r\nraising, horticulture.\r\n\r\nNot only do the students receive instruction in these trades, but they do\r\nactual work, by means of which more than half of them pay some part or all\r\nof their expenses while remaining at the school. Of the sixty buildings\r\nbelonging to the school all but four were almost wholly erected by the\r\nstudents as a part of their industrial education. Even the bricks which go\r\ninto the walls are made by students in the school's brick yard, in which,\r\nlast year, they manufactured two million bricks.\r\n\r\nWhen we first began this work at Tuskegee, and the idea got spread among\r\nthe people of my race that the students who came to the Tuskegee school\r\nwere to be taught industries in connection with their academic studies,\r\nwere, in other words, to be taught to work, I received a great many verbal\r\nmessages and letters from parents informing me that they wanted their\r\nchildren taught books, but not how to work. This protest went on for three\r\nor four years, but I am glad to be able to say now that our people have\r\nvery generally been educated to a point where they see their own needs and\r\nconditions so clearly that it has been several years since we have had a\r\nsingle protest from parents against the teaching of industries, and there\r\nis now a positive enthusiasm for it. In fact, public sentiment among the\r\nstudents at Tuskegee is now so strong for industrial training that it\r\nwould hardly permit a student to remain on the grounds who was unwilling\r\nto labor.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that too often mere book education leaves the Negro young\r\nman or woman in a weak position. For example, I have seen a Negro girl\r\ntaught by her mother to help her in doing laundry work at home. Later,\r\nwhen this same girl was graduated from the public schools or a high school\r\nand returned home she finds herself educated out of sympathy with laundry\r\nwork, and yet not able to find anything to do which seems in keeping with\r\nthe cost and character of her education. Under these circumstances we\r\ncannot be surprised if she does not fulfill the expectations made for her.\r\nWhat should have been done for her, it seems to me, was to give her along\r\nwith her academic education thorough training in the latest and best\r\nmethods of laundry work, so that she could have put so much skill and\r\nintelligence into it that the work would have been lifted out from the\r\nplane of drudgery[A]. The home which she would then have been able to\r\nfound by the results of her work would have enabled her to help her\r\nchildren to take a still more responsible position in life.\r\n\r\nAlmost from the first Tuskegee has kept in mind--and this I think should\r\nbe the policy of all industrial schools--fitting students for occupations\r\nwhich would be open to them in their home communities. Some years ago we\r\nnoted the fact that there was beginning to be a demand in the South for\r\nmen to operate dairies in a skillful, modern manner. We opened a dairy\r\ndepartment in connection with the school, where a number of young men\r\ncould have instruction in the latest and most scientific methods of dairy\r\nwork. At present we have calls--mainly from Southern white men--for twice\r\nas many dairymen as we are able to supply. What is equally satisfactory,\r\nthe reports which come to us indicate that our young men are giving the\r\nhighest satisfaction and are fast changing and improving the dairy product\r\nin the communities into which they go. I use the dairy here as an example.\r\nWhat I have said of this is equally true of many of the other industries\r\nwhich we teach. Aside from the economic value of this work I cannot but\r\nbelieve, and my observation confirms me in my belief, that as we continue\r\nto place Negro men and women of intelligence, religion, modesty,\r\nconscience and skill in every community in the South, who will prove by\r\nactual results their value to the community, I cannot but believe, I say,\r\nthat this will constitute a solution to many of the present political and\r\nsocial difficulties.\r\n\r\nMany seem to think that industrial education is meant to make the Negro\r\nwork as he worked in the days of slavery. This is far from my conception\r\nof industrial education. If this training is worth anything to the Negro,\r\nit consists in teaching him how not to work, but how to make the forces of\r\nnature--air, steam, water, horse-power and electricity--work for him. If\r\nit has any value it is in lifting labor up out of toil and drudgery into\r\nthe plane of the dignified and the beautiful. The Negro in the South works\r\nand works hard; but too often his ignorance and lack of skill causes him\r\nto do his work in the most costly and shiftless manner, and this keeps him\r\nnear the bottom of the ladder in the economic world.\r\n\r\nI have not emphasized particularly in these pages the great need of\r\ntraining the Negro in agriculture, but I believe that this branch of\r\nindustrial education does need very great emphasis. In this connection I\r\nwant to quote some words which Mr. Edgar Gardner Murphy, of Montgomery,\r\nAlabama, has recently written upon this subject:\r\n\r\n\"We must incorporate into our public school system a larger recognition of\r\nthe practical and industrial elements in educational training. Ours is an\r\nagricultural population. The school must be brought more closely to the\r\nsoil. The teaching of history, for example, is all very well, but nobody\r\ncan really know anything of history unless he has been taught to see\r\nthings grow--has so seen things not only with the outward eye, but with\r\nthe eyes of his intelligence and conscience. The actual things of the\r\npresent are more important, however, than the institutions of the past.\r\nEven to young children can be shown the simpler conditions and processes\r\nof growth--how corn is put into the ground--how cotton and potatoes\r\nshould be planted--how to choose the soil best adapted to a particular\r\nplant, how to improve that soil, how to care for the plant while it grows,\r\nhow to get the most value out of it, how to use the elements of waste for\r\nthe fertilization of other crops; how, through the alternation of crops,\r\nthe land may be made to increase the annual value of its products--these\r\nthings, upon their elementary side are absolutely vital to the worth and\r\nsuccess of hundreds of thousands of these people of the Negro race, and\r\nyet our whole educational system has practically ignored them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Such work will mean not only an education in agriculture, but an\r\neducation through agriculture and education, through natural symbols and\r\npractical forms, which will educate as deeply, as broadly and as truly as\r\nany other system which the world has known. Such changes will bring far\r\nlarger results than the mere improvement of our Negroes. They will give\r\nus an agricultural class, a class of tenants or small land owners, trained\r\nnot away from the soil, but in relation to the soil and in intelligent\r\ndependence upon its resources.\"\r\n\r\nI close, then, as I began, by saying that as a slave the Negro was worked,\r\nand that as a freeman he must learn to work. There is still doubt in many\r\nquarters as to the ability of the Negro unguided, unsupported, to hew his\r\nown path and put into visible, tangible, indisputable form, products and\r\nsigns of civilization. This doubt cannot be much affected by abstract\r\narguments, no matter how delicately and convincingly woven together.\r\nPatiently, quietly, doggedly, persistently, through summer and winter,\r\nsunshine and shadow, by self-sacrifice, by foresight, by honesty and\r\nindustry, we must re-enforce argument with results. One farm bought, one\r\nhouse built, one home sweetly and intelligently kept, one man who is the\r\nlargest tax payer or has the largest bank account, one school or church\r\nmaintained, one factory running successfully, one truck garden profitably\r\ncultivated, one patient cured by a Negro doctor, one sermon well\r\npreached, one office well filled, one life cleanly lived--these will tell\r\nmore in our favor than all the abstract eloquence that can be summoned to\r\nplead our cause. Our pathway must be up through the soil, up through\r\nswamps, up through forests, up through the streams, the rocks, up through\r\ncommerce, education and religion!\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: In the original, this was 'drudggery'.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Talented Tenth_\r\n\r\nBy PROF. W.E. BURGHARDT DuBOIS\r\n\r\n  A strong plea for the higher education of the Negro, which those who are\r\n  interested in the future of the freedmen cannot afford to ignore. Prof.\r\n  DuBois produces ample evidence to prove conclusively the truth of his\r\n  statement that \"to attempt to establish any sort of a system of common\r\n  and industrial school training, without _first_ providing for the higher\r\n  training of the very best teachers, is simply throwing your money to the\r\n  winds.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W.E. BURGHARDT DuBOIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Negro race, like all races, is going to be saved by its exceptional\r\nmen. The problem of education, then, among Negroes must first of all deal\r\nwith the Talented Tenth; it is the problem of developing the Best of this\r\nrace that they may guide the Mass away from the contamination and death of\r\nthe Worst, in their own and other races. Now the training of men is a\r\ndifficult and intricate task. Its technique is a matter for educational\r\nexperts, but its object is for the vision of seers. If we make money the\r\nobject of man-training, we shall develop money-makers but not necessarily\r\nmen; if we make technical skill the object of education, we may possess\r\nartisans but not, in nature, men. Men we shall have only as we make\r\nmanhood the object of the work of the schools--intelligence, broad\r\nsympathy, knowledge of the world that was and is, and of the relation of\r\nmen to it--this is the curriculum of that Higher Education which must\r\nunderlie true life. On this foundation we may build bread winning, skill\r\nof hand and quickness of brain, with never a fear lest the child and man\r\nmistake the means of living for the object of life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf this be true--and who can deny it--three tasks lay before me; first to\r\nshow from the past that the Talented Tenth as they have risen among\r\nAmerican Negroes have been worthy of leadership; secondly, to show how\r\nthese men may be educated and developed; and thirdly, to show their\r\nrelation to the Negro problem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYou misjudge us because you do not know us. From the very first it has\r\nbeen the educated and intelligent of the Negro people that have led and\r\nelevated the mass, and the sole obstacles that nullified and retarded\r\ntheir efforts were slavery and race prejudice; for what is slavery but\r\nthe legalized survival of the unfit and the nullification of the work of\r\nnatural internal leadership? Negro leadership, therefore, sought from the\r\nfirst to rid the race of this awful incubus that it might make way for\r\nnatural selection and the survival of the fittest. In colonial days came\r\nPhillis Wheatley and Paul Cuffe striving against the bars of prejudice;\r\nand Benjamin Banneker, the almanac maker, voiced their longings when he\r\nsaid to Thomas Jefferson, \"I freely and cheerfully acknowledge that I am\r\nof the African race, and in colour which is natural to them, of the\r\ndeepest dye; and it is under a sense of the most profound gratitude to the\r\nSupreme Ruler of the Universe, that I now confess to you that I am not\r\nunder that state of tyrannical thraldom and inhuman captivity to which too\r\nmany of my brethren are doomed, but that I have abundantly tasted of the\r\nfruition of those blessings which proceed from that free and unequalled\r\nliberty with which you are favored, and which I hope you will willingly\r\nallow, you have mercifully received from the immediate hand of that Being\r\nfrom whom proceedeth every good and perfect gift.\r\n\r\n\"Suffer me to recall to your mind that time, in which the arms of the\r\nBritish crown were exerted with every powerful effort, in order to reduce\r\nyou to a state of servitude; look back, I entreat you, on the variety of\r\ndangers to which you were exposed; reflect on that period in which every\r\nhuman aid appeared unavailable, and in which even hope and fortitude wore\r\nthe aspect of inability to the conflict, and you cannot but be led to a\r\nserious and grateful sense of your miraculous and providential\r\npreservation, you cannot but acknowledge, that the present freedom and\r\ntranquility which you enjoy, you have mercifully received, and that a\r\npeculiar blessing of heaven.\r\n\r\n\"This, sir, was a time when you clearly saw into the injustice of a state\r\nof Slavery, and in which you had just apprehensions of the horrors of its\r\ncondition. It was then that your abhorrence thereof was so excited, that\r\nyou publicly held forth this true and invaluable doctrine, which is worthy\r\nto be recorded and remembered in all succeeding ages: 'We hold these\r\ntruths to be self evident, that all men are created equal; that they are\r\nendowed with certain inalienable rights, and that among these are life,\r\nliberty and the pursuit of happiness.'\"\r\n\r\nThen came Dr. James Derham, who could tell even the learned Dr. Rush\r\nsomething of medicine, and Lemuel Haynes, to whom Middlebury College gave\r\nan honorary A.M. in 1804. These and others we may call the Revolutionary\r\ngroup of distinguished Negroes--they were persons of marked ability,\r\nleaders of a Talented Tenth, standing conspicuously among the best of\r\ntheir time. They strove by word and deed to save the color line from\r\nbecoming the line between the bond and free, but all they could do was\r\nnullified by Eli Whitney and the Curse of Gold. So they passed into\r\nforgetfulness.\r\n\r\nBut their spirit did not wholly die; here and there in the early part of\r\nthe century came other exceptional men. Some were natural sons of\r\nunnatural fathers and were given often a liberal training and thus a race\r\nof educated mulattoes sprang up to plead for black men's rights. There was\r\nIra Aldridge, whom all Europe loved to honor; there was that Voice crying\r\nin the Wilderness, David Walker, and saying:\r\n\r\n\"I declare it does appear to me as though some nations think God is\r\nasleep, or that he made the Africans for nothing else but to dig their\r\nmines and work their farms, or they cannot believe history, sacred or\r\nprofane. I ask every man who has a heart, and is blessed with the\r\nprivilege of believing--Is not God a God of justice to all his creatures?\r\nDo you say he is? Then if he gives peace and tranquility to tyrants and\r\npermits them to keep our fathers, our mothers, ourselves and our children\r\nin eternal ignorance and wretchedness to support them and their families,\r\nwould he be to us a God of Justice? I ask, O, ye Christians, who hold us\r\nand our children in the most abject ignorance and degradation that ever a\r\npeople were afflicted with since the world began--I say if God gives you\r\npeace and tranquility, and suffers you thus to go on afflicting us, and\r\nour children, who have never given you the least provocation--would He be\r\nto us a God of Justice? If you will allow that we are men, who feel for\r\neach other, does not the blood of our fathers and of us, their children,\r\ncry aloud to the Lord of Sabaoth against you for the cruelties and murders\r\nwith which you have and do continue to afflict us?\"\r\n\r\nThis was the wild voice that first aroused Southern legislators in 1829 to\r\nthe terrors of abolitionism.\r\n\r\nIn 1831 there met that first Negro convention in Philadelphia, at which\r\nthe world gaped curiously but which bravely attacked the problems of race\r\nand slavery, crying out against persecution and declaring that \"Laws as\r\ncruel in themselves as they were unconstitutional and unjust, have in many\r\nplaces been enacted against our poor, unfriended and unoffending brethren\r\n(without a shadow of provocation on our part), at whose bare recital the\r\nvery savage draws himself up for fear of contagion--looks noble and\r\nprides himself because he bears not the name of Christian.\" Side by side\r\nthis free Negro movement, and the movement for abolition, strove until\r\nthey merged into one strong stream. Too little notice has been taken of\r\nthe work which the Talented Tenth among Negroes took in the great\r\nabolition crusade. From the very day that a Philadelphia colored man\r\nbecame the first subscriber to Garrison's \"Liberator,\" to the day when\r\nNegro soldiers made the Emancipation Proclamation possible, black leaders\r\nworked shoulder to shoulder with white men in a movement, the success of\r\nwhich would have been impossible without them. There was Purvis and\r\nRemond, Pennington and Highland Garnett, Sojourner Truth and Alexander\r\nCrummel, and above all, Frederick Douglass--what would the abolition\r\nmovement have been without them? They stood as living examples of the\r\npossibilities of the Negro race, their own hard experiences and well\r\nwrought culture said silently more than all the drawn periods of\r\norators--they were the men who made American slavery impossible. As Maria\r\nWeston Chapman once said, from the school of anti-slavery agitation \"a\r\nthrong of authors, editors, lawyers, orators and accomplished gentlemen of\r\ncolor have taken their degree! It has equally implanted hopes and\r\naspirations, noble thoughts, and sublime purposes, in the hearts of both\r\nraces. It has prepared the white man for the freedom of the black man, and\r\nit has made the black man scorn the thought of enslavement, as does a\r\nwhite man, as far as its influence has extended. Strengthen that noble\r\ninfluence! Before its organization, the country only saw here and there in\r\nslavery some faithful Cudjoe or Dinah, whose strong natures blossomed even\r\nin bondage, like a fine plant beneath a heavy stone. Now, under the\r\nelevating and cherishing influence of the American Anti-slavery Society,\r\nthe colored race, like the white, furnishes Corinthian capitals for the\r\nnoblest temples.\"\r\n\r\nWhere were these black abolitionists trained? Some, like Frederick\r\nDouglass, were self-trained, but yet trained liberally; others, like\r\nAlexander Crummell and McCune Smith, graduated from famous foreign\r\nuniversities. Most of them rose up through the colored schools of New York\r\nand Philadelphia and Boston, taught by college-bred men like Russworm, of\r\nDartmouth, and college-bred white men like Neau and Benezet.\r\n\r\nAfter emancipation came a new group of educated and gifted leaders:\r\nLangston, Bruce and Elliot, Greener, Williams and Payne. Through political\r\norganization, historical and polemic writing and moral regeneration, these\r\nmen strove to uplift their people. It is the fashion of to-day to sneer at\r\nthem and to say that with freedom Negro leadership should have begun at\r\nthe plow and not in the Senate--a foolish and mischievous lie; two hundred\r\nand fifty years that black serf toiled at the plow and yet that toiling\r\nwas in vain till the Senate passed the war amendments; and two hundred\r\nand fifty years more the half-free serf of to-day may toil at his plow,\r\nbut unless he have political rights and righteously guarded civic\r\nstatus, he will still remain the poverty-stricken and ignorant plaything\r\nof rascals, that he now is. This all sane men know even if they dare\r\nnot say it.\r\n\r\nAnd so we come to the present--a day of cowardice and vacillation, of\r\nstrident wide-voiced wrong and faint hearted compromise; of double-faced\r\ndallying with Truth and Right. Who are to-day guiding the work of the\r\nNegro people? The \"exceptions\" of course. And yet so sure as this Talented\r\nTenth is pointed out, the blind worshippers of the Average cry out in\r\nalarm: \"These are exceptions, look here at death, disease and crime--these\r\nare the happy rule.\" Of course they are the rule, because a silly nation\r\nmade them the rule: Because for three long centuries this people lynched\r\nNegroes who dared to be brave, raped black women who dared to be virtuous,\r\ncrushed dark-hued youth who dared to be ambitious, and encouraged and\r\nmade to flourish servility and lewdness and apathy. But not even this was\r\nable to crush all manhood and chastity and aspiration from black folk. A\r\nsaving remnant continually survives and persists, continually aspires,\r\ncontinually shows itself in thrift and ability and character. Exceptional\r\nit is to be sure, but this is its chiefest promise; it shows the\r\ncapability of Negro blood, the promise of black men. Do Americans ever\r\nstop to reflect that there are in this land a million men of Negro blood,\r\nwell-educated, owners of homes, against the honor of whose womanhood no\r\nbreath was ever raised, whose men occupy positions of trust and\r\nusefulness, and who, judged by any standard, have reached the full measure\r\nof the best type of modern European culture? Is it fair, is it decent, is\r\nit Christian to ignore these facts of the Negro problem, to belittle such\r\naspiration, to nullify such leadership and seek to crush these people back\r\ninto the mass out of which by toil and travail, they and their fathers\r\nhave raised themselves?\r\n\r\nCan the masses of the Negro people be in any possible way more quickly\r\nraised than by the effort and example of this aristocracy of talent and\r\ncharacter? Was there ever a nation on God's fair earth civilized from the\r\nbottom upward? Never; it is, ever was and ever will be from the top\r\ndownward that culture filters. The Talented Tenth rises and pulls all that\r\nare worth the saving up to their vantage ground. This is the history of\r\nhuman progress; and the two historic mistakes which have hindered that\r\nprogress were the thinking first that no more could ever rise save the few\r\nalready risen; or second, that it would better the unrisen to pull the\r\nrisen down.\r\n\r\nHow then shall the leaders of a struggling people be trained and the hands\r\nof the risen few strengthened? There can be but one answer: The best and\r\nmost capable of their youth must be schooled in the colleges and\r\nuniversities of the land. We will not quarrel as to just what the\r\nuniversity of the Negro should teach or how it should teach it--I\r\nwillingly admit that each soul and each race-soul needs its own peculiar\r\ncurriculum. But this is true: A university is a human invention for the\r\ntransmission of knowledge and culture from generation to generation,\r\nthrough the training of quick minds and pure hearts, and for this work no\r\nother human invention will suffice, not even trade and industrial schools.\r\n\r\nAll men cannot go to college but some men must; every isolated group or\r\nnation must have its yeast, must have for the talented few centers of\r\ntraining where men are not so mystified and befuddled by the hard and\r\nnecessary toil of earning a living, as to have no aims higher than their\r\nbellies, and no God greater than Gold. This is true training, and thus in\r\nthe beginning were the favored sons of the freedmen trained. Out of the\r\ncolleges of the North came, after the blood of war, Ware, Cravath, Chase,\r\nAndrews, Bumstead and Spence to build the foundations of knowledge and\r\ncivilization in the black South. Where ought they to have begun to build?\r\nAt the bottom, of course, quibbles the mole with his eyes in the earth.\r\nAye! truly at the bottom, at the very bottom; at the bottom of knowledge,\r\ndown in the very depths of knowledge there where the roots of justice\r\nstrike into the lowest soil of Truth. And so they did begin; they founded\r\ncolleges, and up from the colleges shot normal schools, and out from the\r\nnormal schools went teachers, and around the normal teachers clustered\r\nother teachers to teach the public schools; the college trained in Greek\r\nand Latin and mathematics, 2,000 men; and these men trained full 50,000\r\nothers in morals and manners, and they in turn taught thrift and the\r\nalphabet to nine millions of men, who to-day hold $300,000,000 of\r\nproperty. It was a miracle--the most wonderful peace-battle of the 19th\r\ncentury, and yet to-day men smile at it, and in fine superiority tell us\r\nthat it was all a strange mistake; that a proper way to found a system of\r\neducation is first to gather the children and buy them spelling books and\r\nhoes; afterward men may look about for teachers, if haply they may find\r\nthem; or again they would teach men Work, but as for Life--why, what has\r\nWork to do with Life, they ask vacantly.\r\n\r\nWas the work of these college founders successful; did it stand the test\r\nof time? Did the college graduates, with all their fine theories of life,\r\nreally live? Are they useful men helping to civilize and elevate their\r\nless fortunate fellows? Let us see. Omitting all institutions which have\r\nnot actually graduated students from a college course, there are to-day in\r\nthe United States thirty-four institutions giving something above high\r\nschool training to Negroes and designed especially for this race.\r\n\r\nThree of these were established in border States before the War; thirteen\r\nwere planted by the Freedmen's Bureau in the years 1864-1869; nine were\r\nestablished between 1870 and 1880 by various church bodies; five were\r\nestablished after 1881 by Negro churches, and four are state institutions\r\nsupported by United States' agricultural funds. In most cases the college\r\ndepartments are small adjuncts to high and common school work. As a matter\r\nof fact six institutions--Atlanta, Fisk, Howard, Shaw, Wilberforce and\r\nLeland, are the important Negro colleges so far as actual work and number\r\nof students are concerned. In all these institutions, seven hundred and\r\nfifty Negro college students are enrolled. In grade the best of these\r\ncolleges are about a year behind the smaller New England colleges and a\r\ntypical curriculum is that of Atlanta University. Here students from the\r\ngrammar grades, after a three years' high school course, take a college\r\ncourse of 136 weeks. One-fourth of this time is given to Latin and Greek;\r\none-fifth, to English and modern languages; one-sixth, to history and\r\nsocial science; one-seventh, to natural science; one-eighth to\r\nmathematics, and one-eighth to philosophy and pedagogy.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these students in the South, Negroes have attended Northern\r\ncolleges for many years. As early as 1826 one was graduated from Bowdoin\r\nCollege, and from that time till to-day nearly every year has seen\r\nelsewhere, other such graduates. They have, of course, met much color\r\nprejudice. Fifty years ago very few colleges would admit them at all. Even\r\nto-day no Negro has ever been admitted to Princeton, and at some other\r\nleading institutions they are rather endured than encouraged. Oberlin was\r\nthe great pioneer in the work of blotting out the color line in colleges,\r\nand has more Negro graduates by far than any other Northern college.\r\n\r\nThe total number of Negro college graduates up to 1899, (several of the\r\ngraduates of that year not being reported), was as follows:\r\n\r\n---------------+---------------+-----------------\r\n               |Negro Colleges.| White Colleges.\r\n---------------+---------------+-----------------\r\nBefore '76     |     137       |        75\r\n       '75-80  |     143       |        22\r\n       '80-85  |     250       |        31\r\n       '85-90  |     413       |        43\r\n       '90-95  |     465       |        66\r\n       '96-99  |     475       |        88\r\nClass Unknown  |      57       |        64\r\n---------------+---------------+-----------------\r\nTotal          |   1,914       |       390\r\n---------------+---------------+-----------------\r\n\r\nOf these graduates 2,079 were men and 252 were women; 50 per cent. of\r\nNorthern-born college men come South to work among the masses of their\r\npeople, at a sacrifice which few people realize; nearly 90 per cent. of\r\nthe Southern-born graduates instead of seeking that personal freedom and\r\nbroader intellectual atmosphere which their training has led them, in some\r\ndegree, to conceive, stay and labor and wait in the midst of their black\r\nneighbors and relatives.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting question, and in many respects the crucial question,\r\nto be asked concerning college-bred Negroes, is: Do they earn a living? It\r\nhas been intimated more than once that the higher training of Negroes has\r\nresulted in sending into the world of work, men who could find nothing to\r\ndo suitable to their talents. Now and then there comes a rumor of a\r\ncolored college man working at menial service, etc. Fortunately, returns\r\nas to occupations of college-bred Negroes, gathered by the Atlanta\r\nconference, are quite full--nearly sixty per cent. of the total number of\r\ngraduates.\r\n\r\nThis enables us to reach fairly certain conclusions as to the occupations\r\nof all college-bred Negroes. Of 1,312 persons reported, there were:\r\n\r\n---------------------------------+----------+------------\r\n                                 | Per Cent.|\r\n---------------------------------+----------+------------\r\nTeachers,                        |  53.4    |************\r\nClergymen,                       |  16.8    |******\r\nPhysicians, etc.,                |   6.3    |****\r\nStudents,                        |   5.6    |***\r\nLawyers,                         |   4.7    |***\r\nIn Govt.

It need hardly be argued that the Negro people need social\r\nleadership more than most groups; that they have no traditions to fall\r\nback upon, no long established customs, no strong family ties, no well\r\ndefined social classes. All these things must be slowly and painfully\r\nevolved. The preacher was, even before the war, the group leader of the\r\nNegroes, and the church their greatest social institution. Naturally this\r\npreacher was ignorant and often immoral, and the problem of replacing the\r\nolder type by better educated men has been a difficult one. Both by direct\r\nwork and by direct influence on other preachers, and on congregations, the\r\ncollege-bred preacher has an opportunity for reformatory work and moral\r\ninspiration, the value of which cannot be overestimated.\r\n\r\nIt has, however, been in the furnishing of teachers that the Negro college\r\nhas found its peculiar function. Few persons realize how vast a work, how\r\nmighty a revolution has been thus accomplished. To furnish five millions\r\nand more of ignorant people with teachers of their own race and blood, in\r\none generation, was not only a very difficult undertaking, but a very\r\nimportant one, in that, it placed before the eyes of almost every Negro\r\nchild an attainable ideal. It brought the masses of the blacks in contact\r\nwith modern civilization, made black men the leaders of their communities\r\nand trainers of the new generation. In this work college-bred Negroes were\r\nfirst teachers, and then teachers of teachers. And here it is that the\r\nbroad culture of college work has been of peculiar value. Knowledge of\r\nlife and its wider meaning, has been the point of the Negro's deepest\r\nignorance, and the sending out of teachers whose training has not been\r\nsimply for bread winning, but also for human culture, has been of\r\ninestimable value in the training of these men.\r\n\r\nIn earlier years the two occupations of preacher and teacher were\r\npractically the only ones open to the black college graduate. Of later\r\nyears a larger diversity of life among his people, has opened new avenues\r\nof employment. Nor have these college men been paupers and spendthrifts;\r\n557 college-bred Negroes owned in 1899, $1,342,862.50 worth of real\r\nestate, (assessed value) or $2,411 per family. The real value of the total\r\naccumulations of the whole group is perhaps about $10,000,000, or $5,000 a\r\npiece. Pitiful, is it not, beside the fortunes of oil kings and steel\r\ntrusts, but after all is the fortune of the millionaire the only stamp of\r\ntrue and successful living? Alas! it is, with many, and there's the rub.\r\n\r\nThe problem of training the Negro is to-day immensely complicated by the\r\nfact that the whole question of the efficiency and appropriateness of our\r\npresent systems of education, for any kind of child, is a matter of active\r\ndebate, in which final settlement seems still afar off. Consequently it\r\noften happens that persons arguing for or against certain systems of\r\neducation for Negroes, have these controversies in mind and miss the real\r\nquestion at issue. The main question, so far as the Southern Negro is\r\nconcerned, is: What under the present circumstance, must a system of\r\neducation do in order to raise the Negro as quickly as possible in the\r\nscale of civilization? The answer to this question seems to me clear: It\r\nmust strengthen the Negro's character, increase his knowledge and teach\r\nhim to earn a living. Now it goes without saying, that it is hard to do\r\nall these things simultaneously or suddenly, and that at the same time it\r\nwill not do to give all the attention to one and neglect the others; we\r\ncould give black boys trades, but that alone will not civilize a race of\r\nex-slaves; we might simply increase their knowledge of the world, but this\r\nwould not necessarily make them wish to use this knowledge honestly; we\r\nmight seek to strengthen character and purpose, but to what end if this\r\npeople have nothing to eat or to wear? A system of education is not one\r\nthing, nor does it have a single definite object, nor is it a mere matter\r\nof schools. Education is that whole system of human training within and\r\nwithout the school house walls, which molds and develops men. If then we\r\nstart out to train an ignorant and unskilled people with a heritage of bad\r\nhabits, our system of training must set before itself two great aims--the\r\none dealing with knowledge and character, the other part seeking to give\r\nthe child the technical knowledge necessary for him to earn a living under\r\nthe present circumstances. These objects are accomplished in part by the\r\nopening of the common schools on the one, and of the industrial schools on\r\nthe other. But only in part, for there must also be trained those who are\r\nto teach these schools--men and women of knowledge and culture and\r\ntechnical skill who understand modern civilization, and have the training\r\nand aptitude to impart it to the children under them. There must be\r\nteachers, and teachers of teachers, and to attempt to establish any sort\r\nof a system of common and industrial school training, without _first_\r\n(and I say _first_ advisedly) without _first_ providing for the higher\r\ntraining of the very best teachers, is simply throwing your money to the\r\nwinds. School houses do not teach themselves--piles of brick and mortar\r\nand machinery do not send out _men_. It is the trained, living human soul,\r\ncultivated and strengthened by long study and thought, that breathes the\r\nreal breath of life into boys and girls and makes them human, whether they\r\nbe black or white, Greek, Russian or American. Nothing, in these latter\r\ndays, has so dampened the faith of thinking Negroes in recent educational\r\nmovements, as the fact that such movements have been accompanied by\r\nridicule and denouncement and decrying of those very institutions of\r\nhigher training which made the Negro public school possible, and make\r\nNegro industrial schools thinkable. It was Fisk, Atlanta, Howard and\r\nStraight, those colleges born of the faith and sacrifice of the\r\nabolitionists, that placed in the black schools of the South the 30,000\r\nteachers and more, which some, who depreciate the work of these higher\r\nschools, are using to teach their own new experiments. If Hampton,\r\nTuskegee and the hundred other industrial schools prove in the future to\r\nbe as successful as they deserve to be, then their success in training\r\nblack artisans for the South, will be due primarily to the white colleges\r\nof the North and the black colleges of the South, which trained the\r\nteachers who to-day conduct these institutions. There was a time when the\r\nAmerican people believed pretty devoutly that a log of wood with a boy at\r\none end and Mark Hopkins at the other, represented the highest ideal of\r\nhuman training. But in these eager days it would seem that we have changed\r\nall that and think it necessary to add a couple of saw-mills and a hammer\r\nto this outfit, and, at a pinch, to dispense with the services of Mark\r\nHopkins.\r\n\r\nI would not deny, or for a moment seem to deny, the paramount necessity of\r\nteaching the Negro to work, and to work steadily and skillfully; or seem\r\nto depreciate in the slightest degree the important part industrial\r\nschools must play in the accomplishment of these ends, but I _do_ say, and\r\ninsist upon it, that it is industrialism drunk with its vision of success,\r\nto imagine that its own work can be accomplished without providing for the\r\ntraining of broadly cultured men and women to teach its own teachers, and\r\nto teach the teachers of the public schools.\r\n\r\nBut I have already said that human education is not simply a matter of\r\nschools; it is much more a matter of family and group life--the training\r\nof one's home, of one's daily companions, of one's social class. Now the\r\nblack boy of the South moves in a black world--a world with its own\r\nleaders, its own thoughts, its own ideals. In this world he gets by far\r\nthe larger part of his life training, and through the eyes of this dark\r\nworld he peers into the veiled world beyond. Who guides and determines the\r\neducation which he receives in his world? His teachers here are the\r\ngroup-leaders of the Negro people--the physicians and clergymen, the\r\ntrained fathers and mothers, the influential and forceful men about him of\r\nall kinds; here it is, if at all, that the culture of the surrounding\r\nworld trickles through and is handed on by the graduates of the higher\r\nschools. Can such culture training of group leaders be neglected? Can we\r\nafford to ignore it? Do you think that if the leaders of thought among\r\nNegroes are not trained and educated thinkers, that they will have no\r\nleaders? On the contrary a hundred half-trained demagogues will still hold\r\nthe places they so largely occupy now, and hundreds of vociferous\r\nbusy-bodies will multiply. You have no choice; either you must help\r\nfurnish this race from within its own ranks with thoughtful men of trained\r\nleadership, or you must suffer the evil consequences of a headless\r\nmisguided rabble.\r\n\r\nI am an earnest advocate of manual training and trade teaching for black\r\nboys, and for white boys, too. I believe that next to the founding of\r\nNegro colleges the most valuable addition to Negro education since the\r\nwar, has been industrial training for black boys. Nevertheless, I insist\r\nthat the object of all true education is not to make men carpenters, it is\r\nto make carpenters men; there are two means of making the carpenter a man,\r\neach equally important: the first is to give the group and community in\r\nwhich he works, liberally trained teachers and leaders to teach him and\r\nhis family what life means; the second is to give him sufficient\r\nintelligence and technical skill to make him an efficient workman; the\r\nfirst object demands the Negro college and college-bred men--not a\r\nquantity of such colleges, but a few of excellent quality; not too many\r\ncollege-bred men, but enough to leaven the lump, to inspire the masses, to\r\nraise the Talented Tenth to leadership; the second object demands a good\r\nsystem of common schools, well-taught, conveniently located and properly\r\nequipped.\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Atlanta Conference truly said in 1901:\r\n\r\n\"We call the attention of the Nation to the fact that less than one\r\nmillion of the three million Negro children of school age, are at present\r\nregularly attending school, and these attend a session which lasts only a\r\nfew months.\r\n\r\n\"We are to-day deliberately rearing millions of our citizens in ignorance,\r\nand at the same time limiting the rights of citizenship by educational\r\nqualifications. This is unjust. Half the black youth of the land have no\r\nopportunities open to them for learning to read, write and cipher. In the\r\ndiscussion as to the proper training of Negro children after they leave\r\nthe public schools, we have forgotten that they are not yet decently\r\nprovided with public schools.\r\n\r\n\"Propositions are beginning to be made in the South to reduce the already\r\nmeagre school facilities of Negroes. We congratulate the South on\r\nresisting, as much as it has, this pressure, and on the many millions it\r\nhas spent on Negro education. But it is only fair to point out that Negro\r\ntaxes and the Negroes' share of the income from indirect taxes and\r\nendowments have fully repaid this expenditure, so that the Negro public\r\nschool system has not in all probability cost the white taxpayers a single\r\ncent since the war.\r\n\r\n\"This is not fair. Negro schools should be a public burden, since they are\r\na public benefit. The Negro has a right to demand good common school\r\ntraining at the hands of the States and the Nation since by their fault he\r\nis not in position to pay for this himself.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is the chief need for the building up of the Negro public school in\r\nthe South? The Negro race in the South needs teachers to-day above all\r\nelse. This is the concurrent testimony of all who know the situation. For\r\nthe supply of this great demand two things are needed--institutions of\r\nhigher education and money for school houses and salaries. It is usually\r\nassumed that a hundred or more institutions for Negro training are to-day\r\nturning out so many teachers and college-bred men that the race is\r\nthreatened with an over-supply. This is sheer nonsense. There are to-day\r\nless than 3,000 living Negro college graduates in the United States, and\r\nless than 1,000 Negroes in college. Moreover, in the 164 schools for\r\nNegroes, 95 per cent. of their students are doing elementary and secondary\r\nwork, work which should be done in the public schools. Over half the\r\nremaining 2,157 students are taking high school studies. The mass of\r\nso-called \"normal\" schools for the Negro, are simply doing elementary\r\ncommon school work, or, at most, high school work, with a little\r\ninstruction in methods. The Negro colleges and the post-graduate courses\r\nat other institutions are the only agencies for the broader and more\r\ncareful training of teachers. The work of these institutions is hampered\r\nfor lack of funds. It is getting increasingly difficult to get funds for\r\ntraining teachers in the best modern methods, and yet all over the South,\r\nfrom State Superintendents, county officials, city boards and school\r\nprincipals comes the wail, \"We need TEACHERS!\" and teachers must be\r\ntrained. As the fairest minded of all white Southerners, Atticus G.\r\nHaygood, once said: \"The defects of colored teachers are so great as to\r\ncreate an urgent necessity for training better ones. Their excellencies\r\nand their successes are sufficient to justify the best hopes of success in\r\nthe effort, and to vindicate the judgment of those who make large\r\ninvestments of money and service, to give to colored students opportunity\r\nfor thoroughly preparing themselves for the work of teaching children of\r\ntheir people.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth of this has been strikingly shown in the marked improvement of\r\nwhite teachers in the South. Twenty years ago the rank and file of white\r\npublic school teachers were not as good as the Negro teachers. But they,\r\nby scholarships and good salaries, have been encouraged to thorough normal\r\nand collegiate preparation, while the Negro teachers have been discouraged\r\nby starvation wages and the idea that any training will do for a black\r\nteacher. If carpenters are needed it is well and good to train men as\r\ncarpenters. But to train men as carpenters, and then set them to teaching\r\nis wasteful and criminal; and to train men as teachers and then refuse\r\nthem living wages, unless they become carpenters, is rank nonsense.\r\n\r\nThe United States Commissioner of Education says in his report for 1900:\r\n\"For comparison between the white and colored enrollment in secondary and\r\nhigher education, I have added together the enrollment in high schools and\r\nsecondary schools, with the attendance on colleges and universities, not\r\nbeing sure of the actual grade of work done in the colleges and\r\nuniversities. The work done in the secondary schools is reported in such\r\ndetail in this office, that there can be no doubt of its grade.\"\r\n\r\nHe then makes the following comparisons of persons in every million\r\nenrolled in secondary and higher education:\r\n\r\n      _Whole Country._  _Negroes._\r\n1880       4,362            1,289\r\n1900      10,743            2,061\r\n\r\nAnd he concludes: \"While the number in colored high schools and colleges\r\nhad increased somewhat faster than the population, it had not kept pace\r\nwith the average of the whole country, for it had fallen from 30 per cent.\r\nto 24 per cent. of the average quota. Of all colored pupils, one (1) in\r\none hundred was engaged in secondary and higher work, and that ratio has\r\ncontinued substantially for the past twenty years. If the ratio of colored\r\npopulation in secondary and higher education is to be equal to the average\r\nfor the whole country, it must be increased to five times its present\r\naverage.\" And if this be true of the secondary and higher education, it is\r\nsafe to say that the Negro has not one-tenth his quota in college studies.\r\nHow baseless, therefore, is the charge of too much training! We need Negro\r\nteachers for the Negro common schools, and we need first-class normal\r\nschools and colleges to train them. This is the work of higher Negro\r\neducation and it must be done.\r\n\r\nFurther than this, after being provided with group leaders of\r\ncivilization, and a foundation of intelligence in the public schools, the\r\ncarpenter, in order to be a man, needs technical skill. This calls for\r\ntrade schools. Now trade schools are not nearly such simple things as\r\npeople once thought. The original idea was that the \"Industrial\" school\r\nwas to furnish education, practically free, to those willing to work for\r\nit; it was to \"do\" things--i.e.: become a center of productive industry,\r\nit was to be partially, if not wholly, self-supporting, and it was to\r\nteach trades. Admirable as were some of the ideas underlying this scheme,\r\nthe whole thing simply would not work in practice; it was found that if\r\nyou were to use time and material to teach trades thoroughly, you could\r\nnot at the same time keep the industries on a commercial basis and make\r\nthem pay. Many schools started out to do this on a large scale and went\r\ninto virtual bankruptcy. Moreover, it was found also that it was possible\r\nto teach a boy a trade mechanically, without giving him the full\r\neducative benefit of the process, and, vice versa, that there was a\r\ndistinctive educative value in teaching a boy to use his hands and eyes in\r\ncarrying out certain physical processes, even though he did not actually\r\nlearn a trade. It has happened, therefore, in the last decade, that a\r\nnoticeable change has come over the industrial schools. In the first place\r\nthe idea of commercially remunerative industry in a school is being pushed\r\nrapidly to the back-ground. There are still schools with shops and farms\r\nthat bring an income, and schools that use student labor partially for the\r\nerection of their buildings and the furnishing of equipment. It is coming\r\nto be seen, however, in the education of the Negro, as clearly as it has\r\nbeen seen in the education of the youths the world over, that it is the\r\n_boy_ and not the material product, that is the true object of education.\r\nConsequently the object of the industrial school came to be the thorough\r\ntraining of boys regardless of the cost of the training, so long as it was\r\nthoroughly well done.\r\n\r\nEven at this point, however, the difficulties were not surmounted. In the\r\nfirst place modern industry has taken great strides since the war, and the\r\nteaching of trades is no longer a simple matter. Machinery and long\r\nprocesses of work have greatly changed the work of the carpenter, the\r\nironworker and the shoemaker. A really efficient workman must be to-day an\r\nintelligent man who has had good technical training in addition to\r\nthorough common school, and perhaps even higher training. To meet this\r\nsituation the industrial schools began a further development; they\r\nestablished distinct Trade Schools for the thorough training of better\r\nclass artisans, and at the same time they sought to preserve for the\r\npurposes of general education, such of the simpler processes of elementary\r\ntrade learning as were best suited therefor. In this differentiation of\r\nthe Trade School and manual training, the best of the industrial schools\r\nsimply followed the plain trend of the present educational epoch. A\r\nprominent educator tells us that, in Sweden, \"In the beginning the\r\neconomic conception was generally adopted, and everywhere manual training\r\nwas looked upon as a means of preparing the children of the common people\r\nto earn their living. But gradually it came to be recognized that manual\r\ntraining has a more elevated purpose, and one, indeed, more useful in the\r\ndeeper meaning of the term. It came to be considered as an educative\r\nprocess for the complete moral, physical and intellectual development of\r\nthe child.\"\r\n\r\nThus, again, in the manning of trade schools and manual training schools\r\nwe are thrown back upon the higher training as its source and chief\r\nsupport. There was a time when any aged and wornout carpenter could teach\r\nin a trade school. But not so to-day. Indeed the demand for college-bred\r\nmen by a school like Tuskegee, ought to make Mr. Booker T. Washington the\r\nfirmest friend of higher training. Here he has as helpers the son of a\r\nNegro senator, trained in Greek and the humanities, and graduated at\r\nHarvard; the son of a Negro congressman and lawyer, trained in Latin and\r\nmathematics, and graduated at Oberlin; he has as his wife, a woman who\r\nread Virgil and Homer in the same class room with me; he has as college\r\nchaplain, a classical graduate of Atlanta University; as teacher of\r\nscience, a graduate of Fisk; as teacher of history, a graduate of\r\nSmith,--indeed some thirty of his chief teachers are college graduates,\r\nand instead of studying French grammars in the midst of weeds, or buying\r\npianos for dirty cabins, they are at Mr. Washington's right hand helping\r\nhim in a noble work. And yet one of the effects of Mr. Washington's\r\npropaganda has been to throw doubt upon the expediency of such training\r\nfor Negroes, as these persons have had.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMen of America, the problem is plain before you. Here is a race\r\ntransplanted through the criminal foolishness of your fathers. Whether you\r\nlike it or not the millions are here, and here they will remain. If you do\r\nnot lift them up, they will pull you down. Education and work are the\r\nlevers to uplift a people. Work alone will not do it unless inspired by\r\nthe right ideals and guided by intelligence. Education must not simply\r\nteach work--it must teach Life. The Talented Tenth of the Negro race\r\nmust be made leaders of thought and missionaries of culture among their\r\npeople. No others can do this work and Negro colleges must train men\r\nfor it. The Negro race, like all other races, is going to be saved by\r\nits exceptional men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Disfranchisement of the Negro_\r\n\r\nBy CHARLES W. CHESNUTT\r\n\r\n  In this paper the author presents a straightforward statement of facts\r\n  concerning the disfranchisement of the Negro in the Southern States. Mr.\r\n  Chesnutt, who is too well known as a writer to need any introduction to\r\n  an American audience, puts the case for the Negro to the American people\r\n  very plainly, and spares neither the North nor the South.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES W. CHESNUTT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe right of American citizens of African descent, commonly called\r\nNegroes, to vote upon the same terms as other citizens of the United\r\nStates, is plainly declared and firmly fixed by the Constitution. No such\r\nperson is called upon to present reasons why he should possess this right:\r\nthat question is foreclosed by the Constitution. The object of the\r\nelective franchise is to give representation. So long as the Constitution\r\nretains its present form, any State Constitution, or statute, which seeks,\r\nby juggling the ballot, to deny the colored race fair representation, is a\r\nclear violation of the fundamental law of the land, and a corresponding\r\ninjustice to those thus deprived of this right.\r\n\r\nFor thirty-five years this has been the law. As long as it was measurably\r\nrespected, the colored people made rapid strides in education, wealth,\r\ncharacter and self-respect. This the census proves, all statements to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding. A generation has grown to manhood and womanhood\r\nunder the great, inspiring freedom conferred by the Constitution and\r\nprotected by the right of suffrage--protected in large degree by the mere\r\nnaked right, even when its exercise was hindered or denied by unlawful\r\nmeans. They have developed, in every Southern community, good citizens,\r\nwho, if sustained and encouraged by just laws and liberal institutions,\r\nwould greatly augment their number with the passing years, and soon wipe\r\nout the reproach of ignorance, unthrift, low morals and social\r\ninefficiency, thrown at them indiscriminately and therefore unjustly, and\r\nmade the excuse for the equally undiscriminating contempt of their persons\r\nand their rights. They have reduced their illiteracy nearly 50 per cent.\r\nExcluded from the institutions of higher learning in their own States,\r\ntheir young men hold their own, and occasionally carry away honors, in\r\nthe universities of the North. They have accumulated three hundred million\r\ndollars worth of real and personal property. Individuals among them have\r\nacquired substantial wealth, and several have attained to something like\r\nnational distinction in art, letters and educational leadership. They are\r\nnumerously represented in the learned professions. Heavily handicapped,\r\nthey have made such rapid progress that the suspicion is justified that\r\ntheir advancement, rather than any stagnation or retrogression, is the\r\ntrue secret of the virulent Southern hostility to their rights, which has\r\nso influenced Northern opinion that it stands mute, and leaves the colored\r\npeople, upon whom the North conferred liberty, to the tender mercies of\r\nthose who have always denied their fitness for it.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, in passing, that the word \"Negro,\" where used in this\r\npaper, is used solely for convenience. By the census of 1890 there were\r\n1,000,000 colored people in the country who were half, or more than half,\r\nwhite, and logically there must be, as in fact there are, so many who\r\nshare the white blood in some degree, as to justify the assertion that the\r\nrace problem in the United States concerns the welfare and the status of a\r\nmixed race. Their rights are not one whit the more sacred because of this\r\nfact; but in an argument where injustice is sought to be excused because\r\nof fundamental differences of race, it is well enough to bear in mind that\r\nthe race whose rights and liberties are endangered all over this country\r\nby disfranchisement at the South, are the colored people who live in the\r\nUnited States to-day, and not the low-browed, man-eating savage whom the\r\nSouthern white likes to set upon a block and contrast with Shakespeare and\r\nNewton and Washington and Lincoln.\r\n\r\nDespite and in defiance of the Federal Constitution, to-day in the six\r\nSouthern States of Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, North Carolina, South\r\nCarolina and Virginia, containing an aggregate colored population of about\r\n6,000,000, these have been, to all intents and purposes, denied, so far\r\nas the States can effect it, the right to vote. This disfranchisement is\r\naccomplished by various methods, devised with much transparent ingenuity,\r\nthe effort being in each instance to violate the spirit of the Federal\r\nConstitution by disfranchising the Negro, while seeming to respect its\r\nletter by avoiding the mention of race or color.\r\n\r\nThese restrictions fall into three groups. The first comprises a property\r\nqualification--the ownership of $300 worth or more of real or personal\r\nproperty (Alabama, Louisiana, Virginia and South Carolina); the payment of\r\na poll tax (Mississippi, North Carolina, Virginia); an educational\r\nqualification--the ability to read and write (Alabama, Louisiana, North\r\nCarolina). Thus far, those who believe in a restricted suffrage\r\neverywhere, could perhaps find no reasonable fault with any one of these\r\nqualifications, applied either separately or together.\r\n\r\nBut the Negro has made such progress that these restrictions alone would\r\nperhaps not deprive him of effective representation. Hence the second\r\ngroup. This comprises an \"understanding\" clause--the applicant must be\r\nable \"to read, or understand when read to him, any clause in the\r\nConstitution\" (Mississippi), or to read and explain, or to understand and\r\nexplain when read to him, any section of the Constitution (Virginia); an\r\nemployment qualification--the voter must be regularly employed in some\r\nlawful occupation (Alabama); a character qualification--the voter must be\r\na person of good character and who \"understands the duties and obligations\r\nof citizens under a republican (!) form of government\" (Alabama).\r\n\r\nThe qualifications under the first group it will be seen, are capable of\r\nexact demonstration; those under the second group are left to the\r\ndiscretion and judgment of the registering officer--for in most instances\r\nthese are all requirements for registration, which must precede voting.\r\n\r\nBut the first group, by its own force, and the second group, under\r\nimaginable conditions, might exclude not only the Negro vote, but a large\r\npart of the white vote. Hence, the third group, which comprises: a\r\nmilitary service qualification--any man who went to war, willingly or\r\nunwillingly, in a good cause or a bad, is entitled to register (Ala.,\r\nVa.); a prescriptive qualification, under which are included all male\r\npersons who were entitled to vote on January 1, 1867, at which date the\r\nNegro had not yet been given the right to vote; a hereditary\r\nqualification, (the so-called \"grandfather\" clause), whereby any son\r\n(Va.), or descendant (Ala.), of a soldier, and (N.C.) the descendant of\r\nany person who had the right to vote on January 1, 1867, inherits that\r\nright. If the voter wish to take advantage of these last provisions, which\r\nare in the nature of exceptions to a general rule, he must register within\r\na stated time, whereupon he becomes a member of a privileged class of\r\npermanently enrolled voters not subject to any of the other restrictions.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that these restrictions are variously combined in the\r\ndifferent States, and it is apparent that if combined to their declared\r\nend, practically every Negro may, under color of law, be denied the right\r\nto vote, and practically every white man accorded that right. The\r\neffectiveness of these provisions to exclude the Negro vote is proved by\r\nthe Alabama registration under the new State Constitution. Out of a total,\r\nby the census of 1900, of 181,471 Negro \"males of voting age,\" less than\r\n3,000 are registered; in Montgomery county alone, the seat of the State\r\ncapital, where there are 7,000 Negro males of voting age, only 47 have\r\nbeen allowed to register, while in several counties not one single Negro\r\nis permitted to exercise the franchise.\r\n\r\nThese methods of disfranchisement have stood such tests as the United\r\nStates Courts, including the Supreme Court, have thus far seen fit to\r\napply, in such cases as have been before them for adjudication. These\r\ninclude a case based upon the \"understanding\" clause of the Mississippi\r\nConstitution, in which the Supreme Court held, in effect, that since there\r\nwas no ambiguity in the language employed and the Negro was not directly\r\nnamed, the Court would not go behind the wording of the Constitution to\r\nfind a meaning which discriminated against the colored voter; and the\r\nrecent case of Jackson vs. Giles, brought by a colored citizen of\r\nMontgomery, Alabama, in which the Supreme Court confesses itself impotent\r\nto provide a remedy for what, by inference, it acknowledges _may_ be a\r\n\"great political wrong,\" carefully avoiding, however, to state that it is\r\na wrong, although the vital prayer of the petition was for a decision upon\r\nthis very point.\r\n\r\nNow, what is the effect of this wholesale disfranchisement of colored men,\r\nupon their citizenship. The value of food to the human organism is not\r\nmeasured by the pains of an occasional surfeit, but by the effect of its\r\nentire deprivation. Whether a class of citizens should vote, even if not\r\nalways wisely--what class does?--may best be determined by considering\r\ntheir condition when they are without the right to vote.\r\n\r\nThe colored people are left, in the States where they have been\r\ndisfranchised, absolutely without representation, direct or indirect, in\r\nany law-making body, in any court of justice, in any branch of\r\ngovernment--for the feeble remnant of voters left by law is so\r\ninconsiderable as to be without a shadow of power. Constituting one-eighth\r\nof the population of the whole country, two-fifths of the whole Southern\r\npeople, and a majority in several States, they are not able, because\r\ndisfranchised where most numerous, to send one representative to the\r\nCongress, which, by the decision in the Alabama case, is held by the\r\nSupreme Court to be the only body, outside of the State itself, competent\r\nto give relief from a great political wrong. By former decisions of the\r\nsame tribunal, even Congress is impotent to protect their civil rights,\r\nthe Fourteenth Amendment having long since, by the consent of the same\r\nCourt, been in many respects as completely nullified as the Fifteenth\r\nAmendment is now sought to be. They have no direct representation in any\r\nSouthern legislature, and no voice in determining the choice of white men\r\nwho might be friendly to their rights. Nor are they able to influence the\r\nelection of judges or other public officials, to whom are entrusted the\r\nprotection of their lives, their liberties and their property. No judge is\r\nrendered careful, no sheriff diligent, for fear that he may offend a black\r\nconstituency; the contrary is most lamentably true; day after day the\r\ncatalogue of lynchings and anti-Negro riots upon every imaginable pretext,\r\ngrows longer and more appalling. The country stands face to face with the\r\nrevival of slavery; at the moment of this writing a federal grand jury in\r\nAlabama is uncovering a system of peonage established under cover of law.\r\n\r\nUnder the Southern program it is sought to exclude colored men from every\r\ngrade of the public service; not only from the higher administrative\r\nfunctions, to which few of them would in any event, for a long time\r\naspire, but from the lowest as well. A Negro may not be a constable or a\r\npoliceman. He is subjected by law to many degrading discriminations. He is\r\nrequired to be separated from white people on railroads and street cars,\r\nand, by custom, debarred from inns and places of public entertainment. His\r\nequal right to a free public education is constantly threatened and is\r\nnowhere equitably recognized. In Georgia, as has been shown by Dr. DuBois,\r\nwhere the law provides for a pro rata distribution of the public school\r\nfund between the races, and where the colored school population is 48 per\r\ncent. of the total, the amount of the fund devoted to their schools is\r\nonly 20 per cent. In New Orleans, with an immense colored population, many\r\nof whom are persons of means and culture, all colored public schools above\r\nthe fifth grade have been abolished.\r\n\r\nThe Negro is subjected to taxation without representation, which the\r\nforefathers of this Republic made the basis of a bloody revolution.\r\n\r\nFlushed with their local success, and encouraged by the timidity of the\r\nCourts and the indifference of public opinion, the Southern whites have\r\ncarried their campaign into the national government, with an ominous\r\ndegree of success. If they shall have their way, no Negro can fill any\r\nfederal office, or occupy, in the public service, any position that is not\r\nmenial. This is not an inference, but the openly, passionately avowed\r\nsentiment of the white South. The right to employment in the public\r\nservice is an exceedingly valuable one, for which white men have struggled\r\nand fought. A vast army of men are employed in the administration of\r\npublic affairs. Many avenues of employment are closed to colored men by\r\npopular prejudice. If their right to public employment is recognized, and\r\nthe way to it open through the civil service, or the appointing power, or\r\nthe suffrages of the people, it will prove, as it has already, a strong\r\nincentive to effort and a powerful lever for advancement. Its value to the\r\nNegro, like that of the right to vote, may be judged by the eagerness of\r\nthe whites to deprive him of it.\r\n\r\nNot only is the Negro taxed without representation in the States referred\r\nto, but he pays, through the tariff and internal revenue, a tax to a\r\nNational government whose supreme judicial tribunal declares that it\r\ncannot, through the executive arm, enforce its own decrees, and,\r\ntherefore, refuses to pass upon a question, squarely before it, involving\r\na basic right of citizenship. For the decision of the Supreme Court in the\r\nGiles case, if it foreshadows the attitude which the Court will take upon\r\nother cases to the same general end which will soon come before it, is\r\nscarcely less than a reaffirmation of the Dred Scott decision; it\r\ncertainly amounts to this--that in spite of the Fifteenth Amendment,\r\ncolored men in the United States have no political rights which the States\r\nare bound to respect. To say this much is to say that all the privileges\r\nand immunities which Negroes henceforth enjoy, must be by favor of the\r\nwhites; they are not _rights_. The whites have so declared; they proclaim\r\nthat the country is theirs, that the Negro should be thankful that he has\r\nso much, when so much more might be withheld from him. He stands upon a\r\nlower footing than any alien; he has no government to which he may look\r\nfor protection.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the white South sends to Congress, on a basis including the\r\nNegro population, a delegation nearly twice as large as it is justly\r\nentitled to, and one which may always safely be relied upon to oppose in\r\nCongress every measure which seeks to protect the equality, or to enlarge\r\nthe rights of colored citizens. The grossness of this injustice is all the\r\nmore apparent since the Supreme Court, in the Alabama case referred to,\r\nhas declared the legislative and political department of the government to\r\nbe the only power which can right a political wrong. Under this decision\r\nstill further attacks upon the liberties of the citizen may be confidently\r\nexpected. Armed with the Negro's sole weapon of defense, the white South\r\nstands ready to smite down his rights. The ballot was first given to the\r\nNegro to defend him against this very thing. He needs it now far more than\r\nthen, and for even stronger reasons. The 9,000,000 free colored people of\r\nto-day have vastly more to defend than the 3,000,000 hapless blacks who\r\nhad just emerged from slavery. If there be those who maintain that it was\r\na mistake to give the Negro the ballot at the time and in the manner in\r\nwhich it was given, let them take to heart this reflection: that to\r\ndeprive him of it to-day, or to so restrict it as to leave him utterly\r\ndefenseless against the present relentless attitude of the South toward\r\nhis rights, will prove to be a mistake so much greater than the first, as\r\nto be no less than a crime, from which not alone the Southern Negro must\r\nsuffer, but for which the nation will as surely pay the penalty as it paid\r\nfor the crime of slavery. Contempt for law is death to a republic, and\r\nthis one has developed alarming symptoms of the disease.\r\n\r\nAnd now, having thus robbed the Negro of every political and civil\r\n_right_, the white South, in palliation of its course, makes a great show\r\nof magnanimity in leaving him, as the sole remnant of what he acquired\r\nthrough the Civil War, a very inadequate public school education, which,\r\nby the present program, is to be directed mainly towards making him a\r\nbetter agricultural laborer. Even this is put forward as a favor, although\r\nthe Negro's property is taxed to pay for it, and his labor as well. For it\r\nis a well settled principle of political economy, that land and machinery\r\nof themselves produce nothing, and that labor indirectly pays its fair\r\nproportion of the tax upon the public's wealth. The white South seems to\r\nstand to the Negro at present as one, who, having been reluctantly\r\ncompelled to release another from bondage, sees him stumbling forward and\r\nupward, neglected by his friends and scarcely yet conscious of his own\r\nstrength; seizes him, binds him, and having bereft him of speech, of sight\r\nand of manhood, \"yokes him with the mule\" and exclaims, with a show of\r\nvirtue which ought to deceive no one: \"Behold how good a friend I am of\r\nyours! Have I not left you a stomach and a pair of arms, and will I not\r\ngenerously permit you to work for me with the one, that you may thereby\r\ngain enough to fill the other? A brain you do not need. We will relieve\r\nyou of any responsibility that might seem to demand such an organ.\"\r\n\r\nThe argument of peace-loving Northern white men and Negro opportunists\r\nthat the political power of the Negro having long ago been suppressed by\r\nunlawful means, his right to vote is a mere paper right, of no real value,\r\nand therefore to be lightly yielded for the sake of a hypothetical\r\nharmony, is fatally short-sighted. It is precisely the attitude and\r\nessentially the argument which would have surrendered to the South in the\r\nsixties, and would have left this country to rot in slavery for another\r\ngeneration. White men do not thus argue concerning their own rights. They\r\nknow too well the value of ideals. Southern white men see too clearly the\r\nlatent power of these unexercised rights. If the political power of the\r\nNegro was a nullity because of his ignorance and lack of leadership, why\r\nwere they not content to leave it so, with the pleasing assurance that if\r\nit ever became effective, it would be because the Negroes had grown fit\r\nfor its exercise? On the contrary, they have not rested until the\r\npossibility of its revival was apparently headed off by new State\r\nConstitutions. Nor are they satisfied with this. There is no doubt that an\r\neffort will be made to secure the repeal of the Fifteenth Amendment, and\r\nthus forestall the development of the wealthy and educated Negro, whom the\r\nSouth seems to anticipate as a greater menace than the ignorant ex-slave.\r\nHowever improbable this repeal may seem, it is not a subject to be lightly\r\ndismissed; for it is within the power of the white people of the nation to\r\ndo whatever they wish in the premises--they did it once; they can do it\r\nagain. The Negro and his friends should see to it that the white majority\r\nshall never wish to do anything to his hurt. There still stands, before\r\nthe Negro-hating whites of the South, the specter of a Supreme Court\r\nwhich will interpret the Constitution to mean what it says, and what those\r\nwho enacted it meant, and what the nation, which ratified it, understood,\r\nand which will find power, in a nation which goes beyond seas to\r\nadminister the affairs of distant peoples, to enforce its own fundamental\r\nlaws; the specter, too, of an aroused public opinion which will compel\r\nCongress and the Courts to preserve the liberties of the Republic, which\r\nare the liberties of the people. To wilfully neglect the suffrage, to hold\r\nit lightly, is to tamper with a sacred right; to yield it for anything\r\nelse whatever is simply suicidal. Dropping the element of race,\r\ndisfranchisement is no more than to say to the poor and poorly taught,\r\nthat they must relinquish the right to defend themselves against\r\noppression until they shall have become rich and learned, in competition\r\nwith those already thus favored and possessing the ballot in addition.\r\nThis is not the philosophy of history. The growth of liberty has been the\r\nconstant struggle of the poor against the privileged classes; and the\r\ngoal of that struggle has ever been the equality of all men before the\r\nlaw. The Negro who would yield this right, deserves to be a slave; he has\r\nthe servile spirit. The rich and the educated can, by virtue of their\r\ninfluence, command many votes; can find other means of protection; the\r\npoor man has but one, he should guard it as a sacred treasure. Long ago,\r\nby fair treatment, the white leaders of the South might have bound the\r\nNegro to themselves with hoops of steel. They have not chosen to take this\r\ncourse, but by assuming from the beginning an attitude hostile to his\r\nrights, have never gained his confidence, and now seek by foul means to\r\ndestroy where they have never sought by fair means to control.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the effect of disfranchisement upon the colored race; it\r\nis to the race as a whole, that the argument of the problem is generally\r\ndirected. But the unit of society in a republic is the individual, and not\r\nthe race, the failure to recognize this fact being the fundamental error\r\nwhich has beclouded the whole discussion. The effect of disfranchisement\r\nupon the individual is scarcely less disastrous. I do not speak of the\r\nmoral effect of injustice upon those who suffer from it; I refer rather to\r\nthe practical consequences which may be appreciated by any mind. No\r\ncountry is free in which the way upward is not open for every man to try,\r\nand for every properly qualified man to attain whatever of good the\r\ncommunity life may offer. Such a condition does not exist, at the South,\r\neven in theory, for any man of color. In no career can such a man compete\r\nwith white men upon equal terms. He must not only meet the prejudice of\r\nthe individual, not only the united prejudice of the white community; but\r\nlest some one should wish to treat him fairly, he is met at every turn\r\nwith some legal prohibition which says, \"Thou shalt not,\" or \"Thus far\r\nshalt thou go and no farther.\" But the Negro race is viable; it adapts\r\nitself readily to circumstances; and being thus adaptable, there is\r\nalways the temptation to\r\n\r\n    \"Crook the pregnant hinges of the knee,\r\n    Where thrift may follow fawning.\"\r\n\r\nHe who can most skilfully balance himself upon the advancing or receding\r\nwave of white opinion concerning his race, is surest of such measure of\r\nprosperity as is permitted to men of dark skins. There are Negro teachers\r\nin the South--the privilege of teaching in their own schools is the one\r\nrespectable branch of the public service still left open to them--who, for\r\na grudging appropriation from a Southern legislature, will decry their own\r\nrace, approve their own degradation, and laud their oppressors. Deprived\r\nof the right to vote, and, therefore, of any power to demand what is their\r\ndue, they feel impelled to buy the tolerance of the whites at any\r\nsacrifice. If to live is the first duty of man, as perhaps it is the first\r\ninstinct, then those who thus stoop to conquer may be right. But is it\r\nneedful to stoop so low, and if so, where lies the ultimate\r\nresponsibility for this abasement?\r\n\r\nI shall say nothing about the moral effect of disfranchisement upon the\r\nwhite people, or upon the State itself. What slavery made of the Southern\r\nwhites is a matter of history. The abolition of slavery gave the South an\r\nopportunity to emerge from barbarism. Present conditions indicate that the\r\nspirit which dominated slavery still curses the fair section over which\r\nthat institution spread its blight.\r\n\r\nAnd now, is the situation remediless? If not so, where lies the remedy?\r\nFirst let us take up those remedies suggested by the men who approve of\r\ndisfranchisement, though they may sometimes deplore the method, or regret\r\nthe necessity.\r\n\r\nTime, we are told, heals all diseases, rights all wrongs, and is the only\r\ncure for this one. It is a cowardly argument. These people are entitled to\r\ntheir rights to-day, while they are yet alive to enjoy them; and it is\r\npoor statesmanship and worse morals to nurse a present evil and thrust it\r\nforward upon a future generation for correction. The nation can no more\r\nhonestly do this than it could thrust back upon a past generation the\r\nresponsibility for slavery. It had to meet that responsibility; it ought\r\nto meet this one.\r\n\r\nEducation has been put forward as the great corrective--preferably\r\nindustrial education. The intellect of the whites is to be educated to the\r\npoint where they will so appreciate the blessings of liberty and equality,\r\nas of their own motion to enlarge and defend the Negro's rights. The\r\nNegroes, on the other hand, are to be so trained as to make them, not\r\nequal with the whites in any way--God save the mark! this would be\r\nunthinkable!--but so useful to the community that the whites will protect\r\nthem rather than to lose their valuable services. Some few enthusiasts go\r\nso far as to maintain that by virtue of education the Negro will, in time,\r\nbecome strong enough to protect himself against any aggression of the\r\nwhites; this, it may be said, is a strictly Northern view.\r\n\r\nIt is not quite clearly apparent how education alone, in the ordinary\r\nmeaning of the word, is to solve, in any appreciable time, the problem of\r\nthe relations of Southern white and black people. The need of education of\r\nall kinds for both races is wofully apparent. But men and nations have\r\nbeen free without being learned, and there have been educated slaves.\r\nLiberty has been known to languish where culture had reached a very high\r\ndevelopment. Nations do not first become rich and learned and then free,\r\nbut the lesson of history has been that they first become free and then\r\nrich and learned, and oftentimes fall back into slavery again because of\r\ntoo great wealth, and the resulting luxury and carelessness of civic\r\nvirtues. The process of education has been going on rapidly in the\r\nSouthern States since the Civil War, and yet, if we take superficial\r\nindications, the rights of the Negroes are at a lower ebb than at any time\r\nduring the thirty-five years of their freedom, and the race prejudice more\r\nintense and uncompromising. It is not apparent that educated Southerners\r\nare less rancorous than others in their speech concerning the Negro, or\r\nless hostile in their attitude toward his rights. It is their voice alone\r\nthat we have heard in this discussion; and if, as they state, they are\r\nliberal in their views as compared with the more ignorant whites, then God\r\nsave the Negro!\r\n\r\nI was told, in so many words, two years ago, by the Superintendent of\r\nPublic Schools of a Southern city that \"there was no place in the modern\r\nworld for the Negro, except under the ground.\" If gentlemen holding such\r\nopinions are to instruct the white youth of the South, would it be at all\r\nsurprising if these, later on, should devote a portion of their leisure to\r\nthe improvement of civilization by putting under the ground as many of\r\nthis superfluous race as possible?\r\n\r\nThe sole excuse made in the South for the prevalent injustice to the Negro\r\nis the difference in race, and the inequalities and antipathies resulting\r\ntherefrom. It has nowhere been declared as a part of the Southern program\r\nthat the Negro, when educated, is to be given a fair representation in\r\ngovernment or an equal opportunity in life; the contrary has been\r\nstrenuously asserted; education can never make of him anything but a\r\nNegro, and, therefore, essentially inferior, and not to be safely trusted\r\nwith any degree of power. A system of education which would tend to soften\r\nthe asperities and lessen the inequalities between the races would be of\r\ninestimable value. An education which by a rigid separation of the races\r\nfrom the kindergarten to the university, fosters this racial antipathy,\r\nand is directed toward emphasizing the superiority of one class and the\r\ninferiority of another, might easily have disastrous, rather than\r\nbeneficial results. It would render the oppressing class more powerful to\r\ninjure, the oppressed quicker to perceive and keener to resent the injury,\r\nwithout proportionate power of defense. The same assimilative education\r\nwhich is given at the North to all children alike, whereby native and\r\nforeign, black and white, are taught side by side in every grade of\r\ninstruction, and are compelled by the exigencies of discipline to keep\r\ntheir prejudices in abeyance, and are given the opportunity to learn and\r\nappreciate one another's good qualities, and to establish friendly\r\nrelations which may exist throughout life, is absent from the Southern\r\nsystem of education, both of the past and as proposed for the future.\r\nEducation is in a broad sense a remedy for all social ills; but the\r\ndisease we have to deal with now is not only constitutional but acute. A\r\nwise physician does not simply give a tonic for a diseased limb, or a high\r\nfever; the patient might be dead before the constitutional remedy could\r\nbecome effective. The evils of slavery, its injury to whites and blacks,\r\nand to the body politic, was clearly perceived and acknowledged by the\r\neducated leaders of the South as far back as the Revolutionary War and the\r\nConstitutional Convention, and yet they made no effort to abolish it.\r\nTheir remedy was the same--time, education, social and economic\r\ndevelopment;--and yet a bloody war was necessary to destroy slavery and\r\nput its spirit temporarily to sleep. When the South and its friends are\r\nready to propose a system of education which will recognize and teach the\r\nequality of all men before the law, the potency of education alone to\r\nsettle the race problem will be more clearly apparent.\r\n\r\nAt present even good Northern men, who wish to educate the Negroes, feel\r\nimpelled to buy this privilege from the none too eager white South, by\r\nconceding away the civil and political rights of those whom they would\r\nbenefit. They have, indeed, gone farther than the Southerners themselves\r\nin approving the disfranchisement of the colored race. Most Southern men,\r\nnow that they have carried their point and disfranchised the Negro, are\r\nwilling to admit, in the language of a recent number of the _Charleston\r\nEvening Post_, that \"the attitude of the Southern white man toward the\r\nNegro is incompatible with the fundamental ideas of the republic.\" It\r\nremained for our Clevelands and Abbotts and Parkhursts to assure them that\r\ntheir unlawful course was right and justifiable, and for the most\r\ndistinguished Negro leader to declare that \"every revised Constitution\r\nthroughout the Southern States has put a premium upon intelligence,\r\nownership of property, thrift and character.\" So does every penitentiary\r\nsentence put a premium upon good conduct; but it is poor consolation to\r\nthe one unjustly condemned, to be told that he may shorten his sentence\r\nsomewhat by good behavior. Dr. Booker T. Washington, whose language is\r\nquoted above, has, by his eminent services in the cause of education, won\r\ndeserved renown. If he has seemed, at times, to those jealous of the best\r\nthings for their race, to decry the higher education, it can easily be\r\nborne in mind that his career is bound up in the success of an industrial\r\nschool; hence any undue stress which he may put upon that branch of\r\neducation may safely be ascribed to the natural zeal of the promoter,\r\nwithout detracting in any degree from the essential value of his\r\nteachings in favor of manual training, thrift and character-building. But\r\nMr. Washington's prominence as an educational leader, among a race whose\r\nprominent leaders are so few, has at times forced him, perhaps\r\nreluctantly, to express himself in regard to the political condition of\r\nhis people, and here his utterances have not always been so wise nor so\r\nhappy. He has declared himself in favor of a restricted suffrage, which at\r\npresent means, for his own people, nothing less than complete loss of\r\nrepresentation--indeed it is only in that connection that the question has\r\nbeen seriously mooted; and he has advised them to go slow in seeking to\r\nenforce their civil and political rights, which, in effect, means silent\r\nsubmission to injustice. Southern white men may applaud this advice as\r\nwise, because it fits in with their purposes; but Senator McEnery of\r\nLouisiana, in a recent article in the _Independent_, voices the Southern\r\nwhite opinion of such acquiescence when he says: \"What other race would\r\nhave submitted so many years to slavery without complaint? _What other\r\nrace would have submitted so quietly to disfranchisement?_ These facts\r\nstamp his (the Negro's) inferiority to the white race.\" The time to\r\nphilosophize about the good there is in evil, is not while its correction\r\nis still possible, but, if at all, after all hope of correction is past.\r\nUntil then it calls for nothing but rigorous condemnation. To try to read\r\nany good thing into these fraudulent Southern constitutions, or to accept\r\nthem as an accomplished fact, is to condone a crime against one's race.\r\nThose who commit crime should bear the odium. It is not a pleasing\r\nspectacle to see the robbed applaud the robber. Silence were better.\r\n\r\nIt has become fashionable to question the wisdom of the Fifteenth\r\nAmendment. I believe it to have been an act of the highest statesmanship,\r\nbased upon the fundamental idea of this Republic, entirely justified by\r\nconditions; experimental in its nature, perhaps, as every new thing must\r\nbe, but just in principle; a choice between methods, of which it seemed\r\nto the great statesmen of that epoch the wisest and the best, and\r\nessentially the most just, bearing in mind the interests of the freedmen\r\nand the Nation, as well as the feelings of the Southern whites; never\r\nfairly tried, and therefore, not yet to be justly condemned. Not one of\r\nthose who condemn it, has been able, even in the light of subsequent\r\nevents, to suggest a better method by which the liberty and civil rights\r\nof the freedmen and their descendants could have been protected. Its\r\nabandonment, as I have shown, leaves this liberty and these rights frankly\r\nwithout any guaranteed protection. All the education which philanthropy or\r\nthe State could offer as a _substitute_ for equality of rights, would be a\r\npoor exchange; there is no defensible reason why they should not go hand\r\nin hand, each encouraging and strengthening the other. The education which\r\none can demand as a right is likely to do more good than the education for\r\nwhich one must sue as a favor.\r\n\r\nThe chief argument against Negro suffrage, the insistently proclaimed\r\nargument, worn threadbare in Congress, on the platform, in the pulpit, in\r\nthe press, in poetry, in fiction, in impassioned rhetoric, is the\r\nreconstruction period. And yet the evils of that period were due far more\r\nto the venality and indifference of white men than to the incapacity of\r\nblack voters. The revised Southern Constitutions adopted under\r\nreconstruction reveal a higher statesmanship than any which preceded or\r\nhave followed them, and prove that the freed voters could as easily have\r\nbeen led into the paths of civic righteousness as into those of\r\nmisgovernment. Certain it is that under reconstruction the civil and\r\npolitical rights of all men were more secure in those States than they\r\nhave ever been since. We will hear less of the evils of reconstruction,\r\nnow that the bugaboo has served its purpose by disfranchising the Negro,\r\nit will be laid aside for a time while the nation discusses the political\r\ncorruption of great cities; the scandalous conditions in Rhode Island; the\r\nevils attending reconstruction in the Philippines, and the scandals in\r\nthe postoffice department--for none of which, by the way, is the Negro\r\ncharged with any responsibility, and for none of which is the restriction\r\nof the suffrage a remedy seriously proposed. Rhode Island is indeed the\r\nonly Northern State which has a property qualification for the franchise!\r\n\r\nThere are three tribunals to which the colored people may justly appeal\r\nfor the protection of their rights: the United States Courts, Congress and\r\npublic opinion. At present all three seem mainly indifferent to any\r\nquestion of human rights under the Constitution. Indeed, Congress and the\r\nCourts merely follow public opinion, seldom lead it. Congress never enacts\r\na measure which is believed to oppose public opinion;--your Congressman\r\nkeeps his ear to the ground. The high, serene atmosphere of the Courts is\r\nnot impervious to its voice; they rarely enforce a law contrary to public\r\nopinion, even the Supreme Court being able, as Charles Sumner once put it,\r\nto find a reason for every decision it may wish to render; or, as\r\nexperience has shown, a method to evade any question which it cannot\r\ndecently decide in accordance with public opinion. The art of straddling\r\nis not confined to the political arena. The Southern situation has been\r\nwell described by a colored editor in Richmond: \"When we seek relief at\r\nthe hands of Congress, we are informed that our plea involves a legal\r\nquestion, and we are referred to the Courts. When we appeal to the Courts,\r\nwe are gravely told that the question is a political one, and that we must\r\ngo to Congress. When Congress enacts remedial legislation, our enemies\r\ntake it to the Supreme Court, which promptly declares it\r\nunconstitutional.\" The Negro might chase his rights round and round this\r\ncircle until the end of time, without finding any relief.\r\n\r\nYet the Constitution is clear and unequivocal in its terms, and no Supreme\r\nCourt can indefinitely continue to construe it as meaning anything but\r\nwhat it says. This Court should be bombarded with suits until it makes\r\nsome definite pronouncement, one way or the other, on the broad question\r\nof the constitutionality of the disfranchising Constitutions of the\r\nSouthern States. The Negro and his friends will then have a clean-cut\r\nissue to take to the forum of public opinion, and a distinct ground upon\r\nwhich to demand legislation for the enforcement of the Federal\r\nConstitution. The case from Alabama was carried to the Supreme Court\r\nexpressly to determine the constitutionality of the Alabama Constitution.\r\nThe Court declared itself without jurisdiction, and in the same breath\r\nwent into the merits of the case far enough to deny relief, without\r\npassing upon the real issue. Had it said, as it might with absolute\r\njustice and perfect propriety, that the Alabama Constitution is a bold and\r\nimpudent violation of the Fifteenth Amendment, the purpose of the lawsuit\r\nwould have been accomplished and a righteous cause vastly strengthened.\r\n\r\nBut public opinion cannot remain permanently indifferent to so vital a\r\nquestion. The agitation is already on. It is at present largely academic,\r\nbut is slowly and resistlessly, forcing itself into politics, which is the\r\nmedium through which republics settle such questions. It cannot much\r\nlonger be contemptuously or indifferently elbowed aside. The South itself\r\nseems bent upon forcing the question to an issue, as, by its arrogant\r\nassumptions, it brought on the Civil War. From that section, too, there\r\ncome now and then, side by side with tales of Southern outrage, excusing\r\nvoices, which at the same time are accusing voices; which admit that the\r\nwhite South is dealing with the Negro unjustly and unwisely; that the\r\nGolden Rule has been forgotten; that the interests of white men alone have\r\nbeen taken into account, and that their true interests as well are being\r\nsacrificed. There is a silent white South, uneasy in conscience, darkened\r\nin counsel, groping for the light, and willing to do the right. They are\r\nas yet a feeble folk, their voices scarcely audible above the clamor of\r\nthe mob. May their convictions ripen into wisdom, and may their numbers\r\nand their courage increase! If the class of Southern white men of whom\r\nJudge Jones of Alabama, is so noble a representative, are supported and\r\nencouraged by a righteous public opinion at the North, they may, in time,\r\nbecome the dominant white South, and we may then look for wisdom and\r\njustice in the place where, so far as the Negro is concerned, they now\r\nseem well-nigh strangers. But even these gentlemen will do well to bear in\r\nmind that so long as they discriminate in any way against the Negro's\r\nequality of right, so long do they set class against class and open the\r\ndoor to every sort of discrimination. There can be no middle ground\r\nbetween justice and injustice, between the citizen and the serf.\r\n\r\nIt is not likely that the North, upon the sober second thought, will\r\npermit the dearly-bought results of the Civil War to be nullified by any\r\nchange in the Constitution. As long as the Fifteenth Amendment stands, the\r\n_rights_ of colored citizens are ultimately secure. There were would-be\r\ndespots in England after the granting of Magna Charta; but it outlived\r\nthem all, and the liberties of the English people are secure. There was\r\nslavery in this land after the Declaration of Independence, yet the faces\r\nof those who love liberty have ever turned to that immortal document. So\r\nwill the Constitution and its principles outlive the prejudices which\r\nwould seek to overthrow it.\r\n\r\nWhat colored men of the South can do to secure their citizenship to-day,\r\nor in the immediate future, is not very clear. Their utterances on\r\npolitical questions, unless they be to concede away the political rights\r\nof their race, or to soothe the consciences of white men by suggesting\r\nthat the problem is insoluble except by some slow remedial process which\r\nwill become effectual only in the distant future, are received with scant\r\nrespect--could scarcely, indeed, be otherwise received, without a voting\r\nconstituency to back them up,--and must be cautiously made, lest they meet\r\nan actively hostile reception. But there are many colored men at the\r\nNorth, where their civil and political rights in the main are respected.\r\nThere every honest man has a vote, which he may freely cast, and which is\r\nreasonably sure to be fairly counted. When this race develops a sufficient\r\npower of combination, under adequate leadership,--and there are signs\r\nalready that this time is near at hand,--the Northern vote can be wielded\r\nirresistibly for the defense of the rights of their Southern brethren.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Northern colored men have the right of free speech,\r\nand they should never cease to demand their rights, to clamor for them, to\r\nguard them jealously, and insistently to invoke law and public sentiment\r\nto maintain them. He who would be free must learn to protect his freedom.\r\nEternal vigilance is the price of liberty. He who would be respected must\r\nrespect himself. The best friend of the Negro is he who would rather see,\r\nwithin the borders of this republic one million free citizens of that\r\nrace, equal before the law, than ten million cringing serfs existing by a\r\ncontemptuous sufferance. A race that is willing to survive upon any other\r\nterms is scarcely worthy of consideration.\r\n\r\nThe direct remedy for the disfranchisement of the Negro lies through\r\npolitical action. One scarcely sees the philosophy of distinguishing\r\nbetween a civil and a political right. But the Supreme Court has\r\nrecognized this distinction and has designated Congress as the power to\r\nright a political wrong. The Fifteenth Amendment gives Congress power to\r\nenforce its provisions. The power would seem to be inherent in government\r\nitself; but anticipating that the enforcement of the Amendment might\r\ninvolve difficulty, they made the superorogatory declaration. Moreover,\r\nthey went further, and passed laws by which they provided for such\r\nenforcement. These the Supreme Court has so far declared insufficient. It\r\nis for Congress to make more laws. It is for colored men and for white men\r\nwho are not content to see the blood-bought results of the Civil War\r\nnullified, to urge and direct public opinion to the point where it will\r\ndemand stringent legislation to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth\r\nAmendments. This demand will rest in law, in morals and in true\r\nstatesmanship; no difficulties attending it could be worse than the\r\npresent ignoble attitude of the Nation toward its own laws and its own\r\nideals--without courage to enforce them, without conscience to change\r\nthem, the United States presents the spectacle of a Nation drifting\r\naimlessly, so far as this vital, National problem is concerned, upon the\r\nsea of irresolution, toward the maelstrom of anarchy.\r\n\r\nThe right of Congress, under the Fourteenth Amendment, to reduce Southern\r\nrepresentation can hardly be disputed. But Congress has a simpler and more\r\ndirect method to accomplish the same end. It is the sole judge of the\r\nqualifications of its own members, and the sole judge of whether any\r\nmember presenting his credentials has met those qualifications. It can\r\nrefuse to seat any member who comes from a district where voters have been\r\ndisfranchised: it can judge for itself whether this has been done, and\r\nthere is no appeal from its decision.\r\n\r\nIf, when it has passed a law, any Court shall refuse to obey its behests,\r\nit can impeach the judges. If any president refuse to lend the executive\r\narm of the government to the enforcement of the law, it can impeach the\r\npresident. No such extreme measures are likely to be necessary for the\r\nenforcement of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments--and the\r\nThirteenth, which is also threatened--but they are mentioned as showing\r\nthat Congress is supreme; and Congress proceeds, the House directly, the\r\nSenate indirectly, from the people and is governed by public opinion. If\r\nthe reduction of Southern representation were to be regarded in the light\r\nof a bargain by which the Fifteenth Amendment was surrendered, then it\r\nmight prove fatal to liberty. If it be inflicted as a punishment and a\r\nwarning, to be followed by more drastic measures if not sufficient, it\r\nwould serve a useful purpose. The Fifteenth Amendment declares that the\r\nright to vote _shall not_ be denied or abridged on account of color; and\r\nany measure adopted by Congress should look to that end. Only as the power\r\nto injure the Negro in Congress is reduced thereby, would a reduction of\r\nrepresentation protect the Negro; without other measures it would still\r\nleave him in the hands of the Southern whites, who could safely be\r\ntrusted to make him pay for their humiliation.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is, somewhere in the Universe a \"Power that works for\r\nrighteousness,\" and that leads men to do justice to one another. To this\r\npower, working upon the hearts and consciences of men, the Negro can\r\nalways appeal. He has the right upon his side, and in the end the right\r\nwill prevail. The Negro will, in time, attain to full manhood and\r\ncitizenship throughout the United States. No better guaranty of this is\r\nneeded than a comparison of his present with his past. Toward this he must\r\ndo his part, as lies within his power and his opportunity. But it will be,\r\nafter all, largely a white man's conflict, fought out in the forum of the\r\npublic conscience. The Negro, though eager enough when opportunity\r\noffered, had comparatively little to do with the abolition of slavery,\r\nwhich was a vastly more formidable task than will be the enforcement of\r\nthe Fifteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Negro and the Law_\r\n\r\nBy WILFORD H. SMITH\r\n\r\n  The law and how it is dodged by enactments infringing upon the rights\r\n  guaranteed to the freedmen by constitutional amendment. A powerful plea\r\n  for justice for the Negro.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILFORD H. SMITH.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe colored people in the United States are indebted to the beneficent\r\nprovisions of the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, for the establishment of their freedom and citizenship,\r\nand it is to these mainly they must look for the maintenance of their\r\nliberty and the protection of their civil rights. These amendments\r\nfollowed close upon the Emancipation Proclamation issued January 1st,\r\n1863, by President Lincoln, and his call for volunteers, which was\r\nanswered by more than three hundred thousand negro soldiers, who, during\r\nthree years of military service, helped the Union arms to victory at\r\nAppomattox. Standing in the shadow of the awful calamity and deep distress\r\nof the civil war, and grateful to God for peace and victory over the\r\nrebellion, the American people, who upheld the Union, rose to the sublime\r\nheights of doing justice to the former slaves, who had grown and\r\nmultiplied with the country from the early settlement at Jamestown. It\r\nlooked like an effort to pay them back for their years of faithfulness and\r\nunrequited toil, by not only making them free but placing them on equal\r\nfooting with themselves in the fundamental law. Certainly, they intended\r\nat least, that they should have as many rights under the Constitution as\r\nare given to white naturalized citizens who come to this country from all\r\nthe nations of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe 13th amendment provides that neither slavery nor involuntary\r\nservitude, except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have\r\nbeen duly convicted, shall exist in the United States or any place subject\r\nto their jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe 14th amendment provides in section one, that all persons born or\r\nnaturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,\r\nare citizens of the United States, and of the State wherein they reside.\r\nNo State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges\r\nor immunities of citizens of the United States, nor shall any State\r\ndeprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of\r\nlaw, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection\r\nof the law.\r\n\r\nThe 15th amendment provides that the right of citizens of the United\r\nStates to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States, or by\r\nany State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Waite, in the case of the United States vs. Cruikshank, 92nd\r\nU.S. 542, said:--\r\n\r\n\"The 14th amendment prohibits a State from denying to any person within\r\nits jurisdiction the equal protection of the law. The equality of the\r\nrights of citizens is a principle of republicanism. Every Republican\r\ngovernment is in duty bound to protect all its citizens in the enjoyment\r\nof this principle if within its power.\"\r\n\r\nThe same Chief Justice, in the case of the United States vs. Reese, 92nd\r\nU.S. 214, said:\r\n\r\n\"The 15th amendment does not confer the right of suffrage upon anyone. It\r\nprevents the States or the United States from giving preference in this\r\nparticular to one citizen of the United States over another, on account of\r\nrace, color or previous condition of servitude. Before its adoption this\r\ncould be done. It was as much within the power of a State to exclude\r\ncitizens of the United States from voting on account of race and color, as\r\nit was on account of age, property or education. Now it is not.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the manifest meaning of equality of citizenship contained\r\nin the constitutional amendments, it was found necessary to reinforce them\r\nby a civil rights law, enacted by the Congress of the United States, March\r\n1st, 1875, entitled, \"An Act To Protect All Citizens In Their Civil and\r\nLegal Rights.\" Its preamble and first section are as follows:--Preamble:\r\n\"Whereas, it is essential to just government we recognize the equality of\r\nall men before the law, and hold that it is the duty of government in its\r\ndealings with the people to mete out equal and exact justice to all, of\r\nwhatever nativity, race, color or persuasion, religious or political, and\r\nit being the appropriate object of legislation to enact great fundamental\r\nprinciples into law, therefore,\r\n\r\n\"Be it enacted that all persons within the jurisdiction of the United\r\nStates shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the\r\naccommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of inns, public\r\nconveyances on land or water, theatres and other places of public\r\namusement, subject only to the conditions and limitations established by\r\nlaw, and applicable alike to citizens of every race and color, regardless\r\nto any previous condition of servitude.\"\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has held this salutary law\r\nunconstitutional and void as applied to the States, but binding in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, and the Territories over which the government of the\r\nUnited States has control.--Civil Rights cases 109 U.S. 63. Since the\r\nSupreme Court's ruling, many Northern and Western States have enacted\r\nsimilar civil rights laws. Equality of citizenship in the United States\r\nsuffered a severe blow when the civil rights bill was struck down by the\r\nSupreme Court. The colored people looked upon the decision as unsound, and\r\nprompted by race prejudice. It was clear that the amendments to the\r\nConstitution were adopted to secure not only their freedom, but their\r\nequal civil rights, and by ratifying the amendments the several States\r\nconceded to the Federal government the power and authority of maintaining\r\nnot alone their freedom, but their equal civil rights in the United States\r\nas well.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Supreme Court put a narrow interpretation on the Constitution,\r\nrather than a liberal one in favor of equal rights; in marked contrast to\r\na recent decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New\r\nYork in a civil rights case arising under the statute of New York, Burks\r\nvs. Bosso, 81 N.Y. Supp, 384. The New York Supreme Court held this\r\nlanguage: \"The liberation of the slaves, and the suppression of the\r\nrebellion, was supplemented by the amendments to the national Constitution\r\naccording to the colored people their civil rights and investing them with\r\ncitizenship. The amendments indicated a clear purpose to secure equal\r\nrights to the black people with the white race. The legislative intent\r\nmust control, and that may be gathered from circumstances inducing the\r\nact. Where that intent has been unvaryingly manifested in one direction,\r\nand that in the prohibition of any discrimination against a large class of\r\ncitizens, the courts should not hesitate to keep apace with legislative\r\npurpose. We must remember that the slightest trace of African blood places\r\na man under the ban of belonging to that race. However respectable and\r\nwhatever he may be, he is ostracized socially, and when the policy of the\r\nlaw is against extending the prohibition of his civil rights, a liberal,\r\nrather than a narrow interpretation should be given to enactments\r\nevidencing the intent to eliminate race discrimination, as far as that\r\ncan be accomplished by legislative intervention.\"\r\n\r\nThe statutory enactments and recent Constitutions of most of the former\r\nslave-holding States, show that they have never looked with favor upon the\r\namendments to the national Constitution. They rather regard them as war\r\nmeasures designed by the North to humiliate and punish the people of those\r\nStates lately in rebellion. While in the main they accept the 13th\r\namendment and concede that the negro should have personal freedom, they\r\nhave never been altogether in harmony with the spirit and purposes of the\r\n14th and 15th amendments. There seems to be a distinct and positive fear\r\non the part of the South that if the negro is given a man's chance, and is\r\naccorded equal civil rights with white men on the juries, on common\r\ncarriers, and in public places, that it will in some way lead to his\r\nsocial equality. This fallacious argument is persisted in, notwithstanding\r\nthe well-known fact, that although the Jews are the leaders in the wealth\r\nand commerce of the South, their civil equality has never, except in rare\r\ninstances, led to any social intermingling with the Southern whites.\r\n\r\nHolding these views the Southern people in 1875, found means to overcome\r\nthe Republican majorities in all the re-constructed States, and\r\npractically drove the negroes out of the law-making bodies of all those\r\nStates. So that, now in all the Southern States, so far as can be\r\nascertained, there is not one negro sitting as a representative in any of\r\nthe law-making bodies. The next step was to deny them representation on\r\nthe grand and petit juries in the State courts, through Jury\r\nCommissioners, who excluded them from the panels.\r\n\r\nTo be taxed without representation is a serious injustice in a republic\r\nwhose foundations are laid upon the principle of \"no taxation without\r\nrepresentation.\" But serious as this phase of the case must appear,\r\ninfinitely more serious is the case when we consider the fact that they\r\nare likewise excluded from the grand and petit juries in all the State\r\ncourts, with the fewest and rarest exceptions. The courts sit in judgment\r\nupon their lives and liberties, and dispose of their dearest earthly\r\npossessions. They are not entitled to life, liberty or property if the\r\ncourts should decide they are not, and yet in this all-important tribunal\r\nthey are denied all voice, except as parties and witnesses, and here and\r\nthere a negro lawyer is permitted to appear. One vote on the grand jury\r\nmight prevent an indictment, and save disgrace and the risk of public\r\ntrial; while one vote on the petit jury might save a life or a term of\r\nimprisonment, for an innocent person pursued and persecuted by powerful\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nWith no voice in the making of the laws, which they are bound to obey, nor\r\nin their administration by the courts, thus tied and helpless, the negroes\r\nwere proscribed by a system of legal enactments intended to wholly nullify\r\nthe letter and spirit of the war amendments to the national organic law.\r\nThis crusade was begun by enacting a system of Jim-Crow car laws in all\r\nthe Southern States, so that now the Jim-Crow cars run from the Gulf of\r\nMexico into the national capital. They are called, \"Separate Car Laws,\"\r\nproviding for separate but equal accommodations for whites and negroes.\r\nThough fair on their face, they are everywhere known to discriminate\r\nagainst the colored people in their administration, and were intended to\r\nhumiliate and degrade them.\r\n\r\nSetting apart separate places for negroes on public carriers, is just as\r\nrepugnant to the spirit and intent of the national Constitution, as would\r\nbe a law compelling all Jews or all Roman Catholics to occupy compartments\r\nspecially set apart for them on account of their religion. If these\r\nstatutes were not especially aimed at the negro, an arrangement of\r\ndifferent fares, such as first, second and third classes, would have been\r\nfar more just and preferable, and would have enabled the refined and\r\nexclusive of both races to avoid the presence of the coarse and vicious,\r\nby selecting the more expensive fare. Still these laws have been upheld by\r\nthe Federal Supreme Court, and pronounced not in conflict with the\r\namendments to the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nCity ordinances providing for separate street cars for white and colored\r\npassengers, are in force in Atlanta, New Orleans, and in nearly all the\r\ncities of the South. In all the principal cities of Alabama, a certain\r\nportion of the street cars is set apart and marked for negroes. The\r\nconductors are clothed with the authority of determining to what race the\r\npassenger belongs, and may arrest persons refusing to obey his orders. It\r\nis often a very difficult task to determine to what race some passengers\r\nbelong, there being so many dark-white persons that might be mistaken for\r\nnegroes, and persons known as negroes who are as fair as any white person.\r\n\r\nIn the State of Georgia, a negro cannot purchase a berth in a sleeping\r\ncar, under any circumstances, no matter where his destination, owing to\r\nthe following statute enacted December 20th, 1899: \"Sleeping car\r\ncompanies, and all railroads operating sleeping cars in this State, shall\r\nseparate the white and colored races, and shall not permit them to occupy\r\nthe same compartment; provided, that nothing in this act shall be\r\nconstrued to compel sleeping car companies or railroads operating sleeping\r\ncars, to carry persons of color in sleeping or parlor cars; provided also,\r\nthat this act shall not apply to colored nurses or servants travelling\r\nwith their employers.\" The violation of this statute is a misdemeanor.\r\n\r\nArticle 45, section 639 of the statutes of Georgia, 1895, makes it a\r\nmisdemeanor to keep or confine white and colored convicts together, or to\r\nchain them together going to and from work. There is also a statute in\r\nGeorgia requiring that a separate tax list be kept in every county, of the\r\nproperty of white and colored persons. Both races generally approve the\r\nlaws prohibiting inter-marriages between white and colored persons, which\r\nseem to be uniform throughout the Southern States.\r\n\r\nFlorida seems to have gone a step further than the rest, and by sections\r\n2612 and 2613, Revised Statutes, 1892, it is made a misdemeanor for a\r\nwhite man and a colored woman, and vice versa, to sleep under the same\r\nroof at night, occupying the same room. Florida is entitled to credit,\r\nhowever, for a statute making marriages between white and colored persons\r\nprior to 1866, where they continue to live together, valid and binding to\r\nall intents and purposes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this forced separation of the races by law, \"from the\r\ncradle to the grave,\" there is yet a sadder and more deplorable\r\nseparation, in the almost universal disposition to leave the negroes\r\nwholly and severely to themselves in their home life and religious life,\r\nby the white Christian people of the South, distinctly manifesting no\r\nconcern in their moral and religious development.\r\n\r\nIn Georgia and the Carolinas, and all the Gulf States (except Texas, where\r\nthe farm labor is mostly white) the negroes on the farms are held by a\r\nsystem of laws which prevents them from leaving the plantations, and\r\nenables the landlord to punish them by fine and imprisonment for any\r\nalleged breach of contract. In the administration of these laws they are\r\nvirtually made slaves to the landlord, as long as they are in debt, and it\r\nis wholly in the power of the landlord to forever keep them in debt.\r\n\r\nBy section 355, of the Criminal Code of South Carolina, 1902, it is made a\r\nmisdemeanor to violate a contract to work and labor on a farm, subject to\r\na fine of not less than five dollars, and more than one hundred dollars,\r\nor imprisonment for not less than ten days, or more than thirty. It is\r\nalso made a misdemeanor to employ any farm laborer while under contract\r\nwith another, or to persuade or entice a farm laborer to leave his\r\nemployer.\r\n\r\nThe Georgia laws are a little stronger in this respect than the laws of\r\nthe other States. By section 121, of the Code of Georgia, 1895, it is\r\nprovided, \"that if any person shall, by offering higher wages, or in any\r\nother way entice, persuade or decoy, or attempt to entice, persuade or\r\ndecoy any farm laborer from his employer, he shall be guilty of a\r\nmisdemeanor.\" Again, by act of December 17th, 1901, the Georgia\r\nLegislature passed a law making it an offense to rent land, or furnish\r\nland to a farm laborer, after he has contracted with another landlord,\r\nwithout first obtaining the consent of the first landlord.\r\n\r\nThe presence of large numbers of negroes in the towns and cities of the\r\nSouth and North can be accounted for by such laws as the above,\r\nadministered by ignorant country magistrates, in nearly all cases the\r\npliant tools of the landlords.\r\n\r\nThe boldest and most open violation of the negro's rights under the\r\nFederal Constitution, was the enactment of the grand-father clauses, and\r\nunderstanding clauses in the new Constitutions of Louisiana, Alabama, the\r\nCarolinas, and Virginia, which have had the effect to deprive the great\r\nbody of them of the right to vote in those States, for no other reason\r\nthan their race and color. Although thus depriving him of his vote, and\r\nall voice in the State governments at the South, in all of them his\r\nproperty is taxed to pay pensions to Confederate soldiers, who fought to\r\ncontinue him in slavery. The fact is, the franchise had been practically\r\ntaken from the negroes in the South since 1876, by admitted fraudulent\r\nmethods and intimidation in elections, but it was not until late years\r\nthat this nullification of the amendments was enacted into State\r\nConstitutions.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to the proposition that it is mainly in the enforcement, or\r\nthe administration of the laws, however fair and equal they may appear on\r\ntheir face, that the constitutional rights of negroes to equal protection\r\nand treatment are denied, not only in the South but in many Northern\r\nStates. There are noble exceptions, however, of high-toned honorable\r\ngentlemen on the bench as trial judges, and Supreme Court justices, in the\r\nSouth, who without regard to consequences have stood for fairness and\r\njustice to the negro in their courts.\r\n\r\nWith the population of the South distinctly divided into two classes, not\r\nthe rich and poor, not the educated and ignorant, not the moral and\r\nimmoral, but simply whites and blacks, all negroes being generally\r\nregarded as inferior and not entitled to the same rights as any white\r\nperson, it is bound to be a difficult matter to obtain fair and just\r\nresults, when there is any sort of conflict between the races. The negro\r\nrealizes this, and knows that he is at an immense disadvantage when he is\r\nforced to litigate with a white man in civil matters, and much more so\r\nwhen he is charged with a crime by a white person.\r\n\r\nThe juries in the South almost always reject the testimony of any number\r\nof negroes if given in opposition to that of a white witness, and this is\r\ntrue in many instances, no matter how unreasonable or inconsistent the\r\ntestimony of the white witness may be. Jurors in the South have been heard\r\nto admit that they would be socially ostracized if they brought in a\r\nverdict upon colored testimony alone, in opposition to white testimony.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it can be best explained how the negro fares in the courts of the\r\nSouth by giving a few cases showing how justice is administered to him:\r\n\r\nA negro boy was brought to the bar for trial before a police magistrate,\r\nin a Southern capital city, charged with assault and battery on a white\r\nboy about the same age, but a little larger. The testimony showed that the\r\nwhite boy had beat the negro on several previous occasions as he passed on\r\nhis way to school, and each time the negro showed no disposition to fight.\r\nOn the morning of the charge he attacked the negro and attempted to cut\r\nhim with a knife, because the negro's mother had reported to the white\r\nboy's mother the previous assaults, and asked her to chastise him. The\r\ncolored boy in trying to keep from being cut was compelled to fight, and\r\ngot the advantage and threw the white boy down and blacked his eyes. The\r\nmagistrate on this evidence fined the negro twenty-five dollars. The\r\nmother of the negro having once been a servant for the magistrate, found\r\ncourage to rise, and said: \"Jedge, yo Honer, can I speak?\" The magistrate\r\nreplied, \"Yes, go on.\" She said, \"Well, Jedge, my boy is ben tellin' me\r\nabout dis white boy meddlin' him on his way to school, but I would not let\r\nmy boy fight, 'cause I 'tole him he couldn't git no jestice in law. But he\r\nhad no other way to go to school 'ceptin' gwine dat way; and den jedge,\r\ndis white chile is bigger an my chile and jumped on him fust with a knife\r\nfor nothin', befo' my boy tetched him. Jedge I am a po' woman, and washes\r\nfur a livin', and ain't got nobody to help me, and can't raise all dat\r\nmoney. I think dat white boy's mammy ought to pay half of dis fine.\" By\r\nthis time her voice had become stifled by her tears. The judge turned to\r\nthe mother of the white boy and said, \"Madam, are you willing to pay half\r\nof this fine?\" She answered, \"Yes, Your Honor.\" And the judge changed the\r\norder to a fine of $12.50 each, against both boys.\r\n\r\nA celebrated case in point reported in the books is, George Maury vs. The\r\nState of Miss., 68 Miss. 605. I reproduce the court's statement of the\r\ncase:--\"This is an appeal from the Circuit Court of Kemper County.\r\nAppellant was convicted of murder and sentenced to imprisonment for life.\r\nHe appears in this court without counsel. The facts are briefly these:\r\nOne, Nicholson, a white man, accompanied by his little son seven years\r\nold, was driving an ox team along a public road; he had occasion to stop\r\nand the oxen were driven by his son; defendant, a negro, also in an ox\r\nwagon, was going along the road in an opposite direction, and met\r\nNicholson's wagon in charge of the little boy. It was after dark, and when\r\nthe wagons met, according to the testimony of Nicholson, the defendant\r\ninsultingly demanded of the boy to give the way, and cursed and abused\r\nhim. Nicholson, hearing the colloquy, hurried to the scene and a fight\r\nensued between him and Maury, in which the latter got the advantage,\r\ninflicting severe blows upon Nicholson. This occurred on Thursday, and on\r\nthe following Sunday night, Nicholson, in company with eleven or twelve of\r\nhis friends, rode to the farm of Maury, and after sending several of their\r\nnumber to ascertain if he was at home, rode rapidly into his yard and\r\ncalled for him. Not finding him, they proceeded to search the premises,\r\nand found several colored men shut up in the smoke house, the door of\r\nwhich some of the searching party had broken open. Maury, the accused, was\r\nnot found there, and about that time some one called out, \"Here is\r\nGeorge.\" Some of the party then started in the direction of the cotton\r\nhouse from which the voice proceeded, when a volley was fired from it, and\r\ntwo of the searching party were killed, one of whom was the son of the\r\nformer owner of the defendant, and the other a brother-in-law of\r\nNicholson. The members of the raiding party testified that their purpose\r\nin going to the home of the defendant was merely to arrest him. It was,\r\nhowever, shown that Nicholson, immediately after the fight on Thursday,\r\ninformed Cobb, and Cobb between Thursday and Sunday night collected the\r\nmen who joined in the raid. No affidavit for the arrest of Maury had been\r\nmade, and none of the party had any warrant, or made any announcement to\r\nthe defendant or his family, of the object of their visit. The accused who\r\ntestified in his own behalf, denied that he was at home at the time of the\r\nshooting, and says he fled before the raiding party arrived. He also\r\ncontradicted Nicholson in his account of the difficulty with him, and\r\ndenies that he spoke harshly to the child.\" Chief Justice Campbell, in\r\ndelivering the opinion of the court said, \"It is inconceivable that the\r\ncrime of murder is predicable of the facts disclosed by the evidence in\r\nthis case. The time and place and circumstances of the killing forbid any\r\nsuch conclusion as a verdict of guilty of murder.\" The judgment of the\r\ntrial court was reversed.\r\n\r\nThis same Chief Justice, in the case of Monroe vs. Mississippi, 71 Miss.\r\n201, where a negro was convicted of rape, makes use of the following\r\nbrave and noble language, reversing the case on the ground of the\r\ninsufficiency of the evidence: \"We might greatly lighten our labors by\r\ndeferring in all cases to the verdict approved by the presiding judge as\r\nto the facts, but our duty is to administer justice without respect of\r\npersons, and do equal right to the poor and the rich. Hence the\r\ndisposition, which we are not ashamed to confess we have, to guard\r\njealously the rights of the poor and friendless and despised, and to be\r\nastute as far as we properly may, against injustice, whether proceeding\r\nfrom wilfulness or indifference.\"\r\n\r\nThe country has produced no abler jurist, nor the South no greater man\r\nthan Ex-Chief Justice Campbell of Mississippi. If the counsel of such men\r\nas he and Chief Justice Garret of the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas,\r\ncould obtain in the South, there would be no problem between the races.\r\nAll would be contented because justice would be administered to the whites\r\nand blacks alike.\r\n\r\nIn the administration of the suffrage sections under the new\r\nConstitutions of the South by the partisan boards of registrars, the same\r\ndiscrimination against negroes was practiced. Their methods are of more or\r\nless interest. The plan was to exclude all negroes from the electorate\r\nwithout excluding a single white man. Under the Alabama Constitution, a\r\nsoldier in the Civil War, either on the Federal or Confederate side, is\r\nentitled to qualification. When a negro goes up to register as a soldier\r\nhe is asked for his discharge. When he presents it he is asked, \"How do we\r\nknow that you are the man whose name is written in this discharge? Bring\r\nus two white men whom we know and who will swear that you have not found\r\nthis paper, and that they know that you were a soldier in the company and\r\nregiment in which you claim to have been.\" This, of course, could not be\r\ndone, and the ex-soldier who risked his life for the Union is denied the\r\nright to vote.\r\n\r\nThe same Constitution provides that if not a soldier or the legal\r\ndescendant of one, an elector must be of good character and understand the\r\nduties and obligations of citizenship under a Republican form of\r\ngovernment. When a negro claims qualifications under the good character\r\nand understanding clauses he is put through an examination similar to the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\"What is a republican form of government?\r\n\r\n\"What is a limited monarchy?\r\n\r\n\"What islands did the United States come into possession of by the\r\nSpanish-American War?\r\n\r\n\"What is the difference between Jeffersonian Democracy and Calhoun\r\nprinciples, as compared to the Monroe Doctrine?\r\n\r\n\"If the Nicaragua Canal is cut, what will be the effect if the Pacific\r\nOcean is two feet higher than the Atlantic?\" Should these questions be\r\nanswered satisfactorily, the negro must still produce two white men known\r\nto the registrars to testify to his good character. A remarkable\r\nexception in the treatment of negroes by the registrars of Dallas county,\r\nAlabama, is shown in the following account taken from the Montgomery\r\nAdvertizer:--\r\n\r\n\"An old negro barber by the name of Edward E. Harris, stepped in before\r\nthe registrars, hat in hand, humble and polite, with a kindly smile on his\r\nface. He respectfully asked to be registered. He signed the application\r\nand waited a few minutes until the registrars had disposed of some other\r\nmatters, and being impressed with his respectful bearing, some member of\r\nthe board commenced to ask a few questions. The old man told his story in\r\na straight forward manner. He said: \"Gentlemen, I am getting to be a\r\npretty old man. I was born here in the South, and I followed my young\r\nmaster through all of the campaigns in Virginia, when Mas' Bob Lee made it\r\nso warm for the Yankees. But our luck left us at Gettysburg. The Yankees\r\ngot around in our rear there, and I got a bullet in the back of my head,\r\nand one in my leg before I got out of that scrape. But I was not hurt\r\nmuch, and my greatest anxiety was about my young master, Mr. John Holly,\r\nwho was a member of the Bur Rifles, 18th Mississippi. He was a private and\r\nenlisted at Jackson, Miss.\r\n\r\n\"He could not be found the first day; I looked all among the dead on the\r\nbattle field for him and he was not there. Next day I got a permit to go\r\nthrough the hospitals, and I looked into the face of every soldier\r\nclosely, in the hope of finding my young master. After many hours of\r\nsearching I found him, but he was dangerously wounded. I stayed by his\r\nside, wounded as I was, for three long weeks, but he gradually grew worse\r\nand then he died. I went out with the body and saw it buried as decently\r\nas I could, and then I went back to Jackson and told the young mistress\r\nhow brave he was in battle, how good he was to me, and told her all the\r\nwords he had sent her, as he lay there on that rude cot in the hospital.\r\nThat is my record as a Confederate soldier, and if you gentlemen care to\r\ngive me a certificate of registration, I would be much obliged to you.\"\r\nIt is needless to say that old Ed. Harris got his certificate.\r\n\r\nIt is insisted upon by the leaders of public opinion at the South, that\r\nnegroes should not be given equal political and civil rights with white\r\nmen, defined by law and enforceable by the courts; but that they should be\r\ncontent to strive to deserve the good wishes and friendly feeling of the\r\nwhites, and if the South is let alone, they will see to it that negroes\r\nget becoming treatment.\r\n\r\nWhile there is a large number of the high-toned, chivalrous element of the\r\nold master class yet living, who would stand by the negro and not permit\r\nhim to be wronged if they could prevent it, yet they are powerless to\r\ncontrol the great mass of the poor whites who are most bitter in their\r\nprejudices against the negro. They should also bear in mind that the old\r\nmaster class is rapidly passing way, and that there is constantly an\r\ninflux of foreigners to the South, and in less than fifty years the\r\nItalians, or some other foreign nationality, may be the ruling class in\r\nall the Southern States; and the negro, deprived of all political and\r\ncivil rights by the Constitution and laws, would be wholly at the mercy of\r\na people without sympathy for him.\r\n\r\nIn order to show the fallacy and the wrong and injustice of this doctrine,\r\nand how helplessly exposed it leaves the negro to the prejudices of the\r\npoor whites, I relate a tragedy in the life of a friend of mine, who was\r\nwell known and respected in the town of Rayville, Louisiana.\r\n\r\nSewall Smith, for many years ran the leading barber shop for whites in the\r\ntown of Rayville, and was well-liked and respected by the leading white\r\nmen of the entire parish. At the suggestion of his customers he bought\r\nLouisiana state lands while they were cheap, before the railroad was put\r\nthrough between Vicksburg and Shreveport; and as the road passed near his\r\nlands he was thereby made a rich man, as wealth goes in those parts. His\r\ngood fortune, however, did not swell his head and he remained the same to\r\nhis friends. He became so useful in his parish that there was never a\r\npublic gathering of the leading white business men that he was not invited\r\nto it, and he was always on the delegations to all the levee or river\r\nconventions sent from his parish. He was chosen to such places by white\r\nmen exclusively; and in his own town he was as safe from wrong or injury,\r\non account of his race or color, as any white man.\r\n\r\nAfter the trains began to run through Rayville, on the Shreveport road, he\r\nhad occasion to visit the town of Ruston, in another parish some miles in\r\nthe interior, and as he got off at the depot, a barefoot, poor white boy\r\nasked to carry his satchel. Smith was a fine looking mulatto, dressed\r\nwell, and could have easily been taken for a white man, and the boy might\r\nnot have known at the time he was a negro. When he arrived at his stopping\r\nplace he gave the boy such a large coin that he asked permission to take\r\nhis satchel back to the train on the following day when he was to return.\r\nThe next day the boy came for the satchel, and they had nearly reached the\r\ndepot about train time, when they passed a saloon where a crowd of poor\r\nwhites sat on boxes whittling sticks. The sight of a negro having a white\r\nboy carrying his satchel quite enraged them, and after cursing and abusing\r\nSmith and the boy, they undertook to kick and assault Smith. Smith\r\ndefended himself. The result was a shooting affair, in which Smith shot\r\ntwo or three of them and was himself shot. The train rolled up while the\r\nfight was in progress, and without inquiring the cause or asking any\r\nquestions whatever, fully a hundred white men jumped off the train and\r\nriddled Smith with bullets. That was the end of it. Nobody was indicted or\r\neven arrested for killing an insolent \"nigger\" that did not keep his\r\nplace. That is the way the affair was regarded in Ruston. Of course, the\r\npeople of Rayville very much regretted it, but they could not do anything,\r\nand could not afford to defend the rights of a negro against white men\r\nunder such circumstances, and the matter dropped.\r\n\r\nI have preferred not to mention the numerous ways and many instances in\r\nwhich the rights of negroes are denied in public places, and on the common\r\ncarriers in the South, under circumstances very humiliating and degrading.\r\nNor have I cared to refer to the barbarous and inhuman prison systems of\r\nthe South, that are worse than anything the imagination can conceive in a\r\ncivilized and Christian land, as shown by reports of legislative\r\ncommittees.\r\n\r\nIf the negro can secure a fair and impartial trial in the courts, and can\r\nbe secure in his life and liberty and property, so as not to be deprived\r\nof them except by due process of law, and can have a voice in the making\r\nand administration of the laws, he shall have gone a great way in the\r\nSouth. It is to be hoped that public opinion can be awakened to this\r\nextent, and that it may assist him to attain that end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Characteristics of the Negro People_\r\n\r\nBy H.T. KEALING\r\n\r\n  A frank statement of the virtues and failings of the race, indicating\r\n  very clearly the evils which must be overcome, and the good which must\r\n  be developed, if success is really to attend the effort to uplift them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H.T. KEALING.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the Negro are of two kinds--the inborn and the\r\ninbred. As they reveal themselves to us, this distinction may not be seen,\r\nbut it exists. Inborn qualities are ineradicable; they belong to the\r\nblood; they constitute individuality; they are independent, or nearly so,\r\nof time and habitat. Inbred qualities are acquired, and are the result of\r\nexperience. They may be overcome by a reversal of the process which\r\ncreated them. The fundamental, or inborn, characteristics of the Negro may\r\nbe found in the African, as well as the American, Negro; but the inbred\r\ncharacteristics of the latter belong to the American life alone.\r\n\r\nThere is but one human nature, made up of constituent elements the same in\r\nall men, and racial or national differences arise from the predominance\r\nof one or another element in this or that race. It is a question of\r\nproportion. The Negro is not a Caucasian, not a Chinese, not an Indian;\r\nthough no psychological quality in the one is absent from the other. The\r\nsame moral sense, called conscience; the same love of harmony in color or\r\nin sound; the same pleasure in acquiring knowledge; the same love of truth\r\nin word, or of fitness in relation; the same love of respect and\r\napprobation; the same vengeful or benevolent feelings; the same appetites,\r\nbelong to all, but in varying proportions. They form the indicia to a\r\npeople's mission, and are our best guides to God's purpose in creating us.\r\nThey constitute the material to be worked on in educating a race, and\r\nsuggest in every case where the stress of civilization or education should\r\nbe applied in order to follow the lines of least resistance.\r\n\r\nBut there are also certain manifestations, the result of training or\r\nneglect, which are not inborn. As they are inculcable, so they are\r\neradicable; and it is only by a loose terminology that we apply the term\r\ncharacteristics to them without distinction between them and the inherent\r\ntraits. In considering the characteristics of the Negro people, therefore,\r\nwe must not confuse the constitutional with the removable. Studied with\r\nsympathy and at first hand, the black man of America will be seen to\r\npossess certain predominant idiosyncrasies of which the following form a\r\nfair catalogue:\r\n\r\n_He is intensely religious._ True religion is based upon a belief in the\r\nsupernatural, upon faith and feeling. A people deeply superstitious are\r\napt to be deeply religious, for both rest upon a belief in a spiritual\r\nworld. Superstition differs from religion in being the untrained and\r\nunenlightened gropings of the human soul after the mysteries of the higher\r\nlife; while the latter, more or less enlightened, \"feels after God, if\r\nhaply,\" it may find Him. The Negro gives abundant evidence of both phases.\r\nThe absolute inability of the master, in the days of slavery, while\r\nsuccessfully vetoing all other kinds of convocation, to stop the Negro's\r\nchurch meetings, as well as the almost phenomenal influence and growth of\r\nhis churches since; and his constant referring of every event, adverse or\r\nfavorable, to the personal ministrations of the Creator, are things unique\r\nand persistent. And the master class reposed more faith in their slaves'\r\nreligion ofttimes than they did in their own. Doubtless much of the\r\nreverential feeling that pervades the American home to-day, above that of\r\nall other nations, is the result of the Negro mammy's devotion and loyalty\r\nto God.\r\n\r\n_He is imaginative._ This is not evinced so much in creative directions as\r\nin poetical, musical, combinatory, inventional and what, if coupled with\r\nlearning, we call literary imagination. Negro eloquence is proverbial. The\r\ncrudest sermon of the most unlettered slave abounded in tropes and glowing\r\ntongue pictures of apochalyptic visions all his own; and, indeed, the\r\npoetic quality of his mind is seen in all his natural efforts when the\r\nself-consciousness of education does not stand guard. The staid religious\r\nmuse of Phillis Wheatley and the rollicking, somewhat jibing, verse of\r\nDunbar show it equally, unpremeditated and spontaneous.\r\n\r\nI have heard by the hour some ordinary old uneducated Negro tell those\r\ninimitable animal stories, brought to literary existence in \"Uncle Remus,\"\r\nwith such quaint humor, delicious conceit and masterly delineation of\r\nplot, character and incident that nothing but the conventional rating of\r\nAesop's Fables could put them in the same class. Then, there are more\r\nNegro inventors than the world supposes. This faculty is impossible\r\nwithout a well-ordered imagination held in leash by a good memory and\r\nlarge perception.\r\n\r\n_He is affectionate and without vindictiveness._ He does not nurse even\r\ngreat wrongs. Mercurial as he is, often furiously angry and frequently in\r\nmurderous mood, he comes nearer not letting the sun go down upon his anger\r\nthan any other man I know. Like Brutus, he may be compared to the flint\r\nwhich,\r\n\r\n    \"Much enforced, shows a hasty spark,\r\n    And straight is cold again.\"\r\n\r\nHis affection is not less towards the Caucasian than to his own race. It\r\nis not saying too much to remark that the soul of the Negro yearns for the\r\nwhite man's good will and respect; and the old ties of love that subsisted\r\nin so many instances in the days of slavery still survive where the\r\nex-slave still lives. The touching case of a Negro Bishop who returned to\r\nthe State in which he had been a slave, and rode twenty miles to see and\r\nalleviate the financial distress of his former master is an exception to\r\nnumerous other similar cases only in the prominence of the Negro\r\nconcerned. I know of another case of a man whose tongue seems dipped in\r\nhyssop when he begins to tell of the wrongs of his race, and who will not\r\nallow anyone to say in his presence that any good came out of slavery,\r\neven incidentally; yet he supports the widowed and aged wife of his\r\nformer master. And, surely, if these two instances are not sufficient to\r\nestablish the general proposition, none will gainsay the patience,\r\nvigilance, loyalty and helpfulness of the Negro slave during the Civil\r\nWar, and of his good old wife who nursed white children at her breast at a\r\ntime when all ties save those of affection were ruptured, and when no\r\nprotection but devoted hearts watched over the \"great house,\" whose head\r\nand master was at the front, fighting to perpetuate slavery. Was it\r\nstupidity on the Negro's part? Not at all. He was well informed as to the\r\noccurrences of the times. A freemasonry kept him posted as well as the\r\nwhites were themselves on the course of the war and the issue of each\r\nbattle. Was it fear that kept him at the old home? Not that, either. Many\r\nthousands _did_ cross the line to freedom; many other thousands (200,000)\r\nfought in the ranks for freedom, but none of them--those who went and\r\nthose who stayed--those who fought and those who worked,--betrayed a\r\ntrust, outraged a female, or rebelled against a duty. It was love, the\r\nnatural wellings of affectionate natures.\r\n\r\n_He has great endurance, both dispositional and physical._ So true is the\r\nfirst that his patience has been the marvel of the world; and, indeed,\r\nmany, regarding this trait manifested in such an unusual degree, doubted\r\nthe Negro's courage, till the splendid record of the '60's and the equal,\r\nbut more recent, record of the '90's, wrote forbearance as the real\r\nexplanation of an endurance seemingly so at variance with manly spirit.\r\n\r\nOf his physical powers, his whole record as a laborer at killing tasks in\r\nthe most trying climate in America speaks so eloquently that nothing but\r\nthe statistics of cotton, corn, rice, sugar, railroad ties and felled\r\nforests can add to the praise of this burden-bearer of the nation. The\r\ncensus tables here are more romantic and thrilling than figures of\r\nrhetoric.\r\n\r\n_He is courageous._ His page in the war record of this country is without\r\nblot or blemish. His commanders unite in pronouncing him admirable for\r\ncourage in the field, commendable for obedience in camp. That he should\r\nexhibit such excellent fighting qualities as a soldier, and yet exercise\r\nthe forbearance that characterizes him as a citizen, is remarkable.\r\n\r\n_He is cheerful._ His ivories are as famous as his songs. That the South\r\nis \"sunny\" is largely due to the brightness his rollicking laugh and\r\nunfailing good nature bring to it. Though the mudsill of the labor world,\r\nhe whistles as he hoes, and no dark broodings or whispered conspirings mar\r\nthe cheerful acceptance of the load he bears. Against the rubber bumper of\r\nhis good cheer things that have crushed and maddened others rebound\r\nwithout damage. When one hears the quaint jubilee songs, set to minor\r\ncadence, he might suppose them the expressions of a melancholy people.\r\nThey are not to be so interpreted. Rather are they the expression of an\r\nexperience, not a nature. Like the subdued voice of a caged bird, these\r\nsongs are the coinage of an occasion, and not the free note of nature.\r\nThe slave sang of griefs he was not allowed to discuss, hence his songs.\r\nThis cheerfulness has enabled the Negro to live and increase under\r\ncircumstances which, in all other instances, have decimated, if not\r\nexterminated, inferior peoples. His plasticity to moulding forces and his\r\nresiliency against crushing ones come from a Thalian philosophy,\r\nunconscious and unstudied, that extracts Epicurean delights from funeral\r\nmeats.\r\n\r\nThe above traits are inborn and fundamental, belonging to the race\r\neverywhere, in Africa as well as America. Strict correctness requires,\r\nhowever, that attention be called to the fact that there are tribal\r\ndifferences among African Negroes that amount almost to the national\r\nvariations of Europe; and these are reflected in American Negroes, who are\r\nthe descendants of these different tribes. There is as much difference\r\nbetween the Mandingo and the Hottentot, both black, as between the Italian\r\nand the German, both white; or between the Bushman and the Zulu, both\r\nblack, as between the Russian and the Englishman, both white. Scientific\r\nexactness, therefore, would require a closer analysis of racial\r\ncharacteristics than an article of this length could give; but, speaking\r\nin a large way, it may be said that in whatever outward conformity may\r\ncome to the race in America by reason of training or contact, these traits\r\nwill lie at the base, the very warp and woof of his soul texture.\r\n\r\nIf, now, we turn to consider his inbred traits, those the result of\r\nexperience, conditions and environments, we find that they exist mainly as\r\ndeficiencies and deformities. These have been superimposed upon the native\r\nsoul endowment. Slavery has been called the Negro's great schoolmaster,\r\nbecause it took him a savage and released him civilized; took him a\r\nheathen and released him a Christian; took him an idler and released him a\r\nlaborer. Undoubtedly it did these things superficially, but one great\r\ndefect is to be charged against this school--it did not teach him the\r\nmeaning of home, purity and providence. To do this is the burden of\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nThe emancipated Negro struggles up to-day against many obstacles, the\r\nentailment of a brutal slavery. Leaving out of consideration the many who\r\nhave already emerged, let us apply our thoughts to the great body of\r\nsubmerged people in the congested districts of city and country who\r\npresent a real problem, and who must be helped to higher things. We note\r\nsome of the heritages under which they stagger up into full development:\r\n\r\n_Shiftlessness._ He had no need to devise and plan in bondage. There was\r\nno need for an enterprising spirit; consequently, he is lacking in\r\nleadership and self-reliance. He is inclined to stay in ruts, and applies\r\nhimself listlessly to a task, feeling that the directive agency should\r\ncome from without.\r\n\r\n_Incontinence._ It is not to the point to say that others are, too.\r\nUndoubtedly, example has as much to do with this laxity as neglect. We\r\nsimply record the fact. A slave's value was increased by his prolificacy.\r\nBegetting children for the auction block could hardly sanctify family\r\nties. It was not nearly so necessary for a slave to know his father as his\r\nowner. Added to the promiscuity encouraged and often forced among this\r\nclass, was the dreadful license which cast lustful Caucasian eyes upon\r\n\"likely\" Negro women.\r\n\r\n_Indolence._ Most men are, especially in a warm climate: but the Negro\r\nacquired more than the natural share, because to him as a bondman laziness\r\nwas great gain, for he had no pecuniary interest in his own labor. Hence,\r\nholidays were more to be desired than whole labor days, and he learned to\r\ndo as little as he might, be excused as often as he could, and hail\r\nSaturday as the oasis in a desert week. He hails it yet. The labor\r\nefficiency of the Negro has greatly increased since the emancipation, for\r\nself-interest is a factor now. In 1865, each Negro produced two-thirds of\r\na bale of cotton; now he produces an average of one whole bale to the man.\r\nBut there is still woful waste of productive energy. A calculation\r\nshowing the comparative productive capacity, man for man, between the\r\nNorthern[B] and Southern laborer would be very interesting.\r\n\r\n_Improvidence and Extravagance._ He will drop the most important job to go\r\non an excursion or parade with his lodge. He spends large sums on\r\nexpensive clothing and luxuries, while going without things necessary to a\r\nreal home. He will cheerfully eat fat bacon and \"pone\" corn-bread all the\r\nweek[C] in order to indulge in unlimited soda-water, melon and fish at the\r\nend. In the cities he is oftener seen dealing with the pawn-broker than\r\nthe banker. His house, when furnished at all, is better furnished that\r\nthat of a white man of equal earning power, but it is on the installment\r\nplan. He is loath to buy a house, because he has no taste for\r\nresponsibility nor faith in himself to manage large concerns; but organs,\r\npianos, clocks, sewing-machines and parlor suits, on time, have no terrors\r\nfor him. This is because he has been accustomed to think in small\r\nnumbers. He does not regard the Scotchman's \"mickle,\" because he does not\r\nstop to consider that the end is a \"muckle.\" He has amassed, at full\r\nvaluation, nearly a billion dollars' worth of property, despite this, but\r\nthis is about one-half of what proper providence would have shown.\r\n\r\n_Untidiness._ Travel through the South and you will be struck with the\r\ngeneral misfit and dilapidated appearance of things. Palings are missing\r\nfrom the fences, gates sag on single hinges, houses are unpainted, window\r\npanes are broken, yards unkempt and the appearance of a squalor greater\r\nthan the real is seen on every side. The inside of the house meets the\r\nsuggestions of the outside. This is a projection of the slave's \"quarters\"\r\ninto freedom. The cabin of the slave was, at best, a place to eat and\r\nsleep in; there was no thought of the esthetic in such places. A quilt on\r\na plank was a luxury to the tired farm-hand, and paint was nothing to the\r\npoor, sun-scorched fellow who sought the house for shade rather than\r\nbeauty. Habits of personal cleanliness were not inculcated, and even now\r\nit is the exception to find a modern bath-room in a Southern home.\r\n\r\n_Dishonesty._ This is the logic, if not the training, of slavery. It is\r\neasy for the unrequited toiler in another's field to justify reprisal;\r\nhence there arose among the Negroes an amended Commandment which added to\r\n\"Thou shalt not steal\" the clause, \"except thou be stolen from.\" It was no\r\ngreat fault, then, according to this code, to purloin a pig, a sheep, a\r\nchicken, or a few potatoes from a master who took all from the slave.\r\n\r\n_Untruthfulness._ This is seen more in innocent and childish exaggeration\r\nthan in vicious distortion. It is the vice of untutored minds to run to\r\ngossip and make miracles of the matter-of-fact. The Negro also tells\r\nfalsehoods from excess of good nature. He promises to do a piece of work\r\non a certain day, because it is so much easier and pleasanter to say Yes,\r\nand stay away, than it is to say No.\r\n\r\n_Business Unreliability._ He does not meet a promise in the way and at\r\nthe time promised. Not being accustomed to business, he has small\r\nconception of the place the promise has in the business world. It is only\r\nrecently he has begun to deal with banks. He, who has no credit, sees[D]\r\nno loss of it in a protested note, especially if he intends to pay it some\r\ntime. That chain which links one man's obligation to another man's\r\nsolvency he has not considered. He is really as good and safe a debt-payer\r\nwhen he owes a white man as the latter can have, but the methods of the\r\nmodern bank, placing a time limit on debts, is his detestation. He much\r\nprefers the _laissez-faire_ of the Southern plantation store.\r\n\r\n_Lack of Initiative._ It was the policy of slavery to crush out the\r\ncombining instinct, and it was well done; for, outside of churches and\r\nsecret societies, the Negro has done little to increase the social\r\nefficiency which can combine many men into an organic whole, subject to\r\nthe corporate will and direction. He has, however, made some hopeful\r\nbeginnings.\r\n\r\n_Suspicion of his own race._ He was taught to watch other Negroes and tell\r\nall that they did. This was slavery's native detective force to discover\r\nincipient insurrection. Each slave learned to distrust his fellow. And\r\nadded to this is the knowledge one Negro has that no other has had half\r\nsufficient experience in business to be a wise counsellor, or a safe\r\nsteward of another man's funds. Almost all Negroes who have acquired\r\nwealth have entrusted its management to white men.\r\n\r\n_Ignorance._ The causes of his ignorance all know. That he has thrown off\r\none-half of it in forty years is a wonderful showing; but a great incubus\r\nremains in the other half, and it demands the nation's attention. What the\r\ncensus calls literacy is often very shallow. The cause of this shallowness\r\nlies, in part, in the poor character and short duration of Southern\r\nschools; in the poverty that snatches the child from school prematurely to\r\nwork for bread; in the multitude of mushroom colleges and get-smart-quick\r\nuniversities scattered over the South, and in the glamour of a\r\nprofessional education that entices poorly prepared students into special\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAdd to this, too, the commercialism of the age which regards each day in\r\nschool as a day out of the market. Boys and girls by scores learn the\r\nmechanical parts of type-writing and stenography without the basal culture\r\nwhich gives these callings their greatest efficiency. They copy a\r\nmanuscript, Chinese-like, mistakes and all; they take you phonetically in\r\nsense as well as sound, having no reserve to draw upon to interpret a\r\nlearned allusion or unusual phrase. Thus while prejudice makes it hard to\r\nsecure a place, auto-deficiency loses many a one that is secured.\r\n\r\nWe have discussed the leading characteristics of the Negro, his inborn\r\nexcellencies and inbred defects, candidly and as they are to be seen in\r\nthe great mass whose place determines the status of the race as a whole.\r\nIt would, however, be to small purpose if we did not ask what can be done\r\nto develop the innate good and correct the bad in a race so puissant and\r\nnumerous? This mass is not inert; it has great reactionary force,\r\nmodifying and influencing all about it. The Negro's excellences have\r\nentered into American character and life already; so have his weaknesses.\r\nHe has brought cheer, love, emotion and religion in saving measure to the\r\nland. He has given it wealth by his brawn and liberty by his blood. His\r\nself-respect, even in abasement, has kept him struggling upward; his\r\nconfidence in his own future has infected his friends and kept him from\r\nnursing despondency or planning anarchy. But he has laid, and does lay,\r\nburdens upon the land, too: his ignorance, his low average of morality,\r\nhis low standards of home, his lack of enterprise, his lack of\r\nself-reliance--these must be cured.\r\n\r\nEvidently, he is to be \"solved\" by educational processes. Everyone of his\r\ninborn traits must be respected and developed to proper proportion.\r\nExcesses and excrescences must not be carelessly dealt with, for they mark\r\nthe fertility of a soil that raises rank weeds because no gardener has\r\ntilled it. His religion must become \"ethics touched with feeling\"--not a\r\nparoxysm, but a principle. His imagination must be given a rudder to guide\r\nits sails; and the first fruits of its proper exercise, as seen in a\r\nDunbar, a Chesnutt, a Coleridge-Taylor and a Tanner, must be pedestaled\r\nalong the Appian Way over which others are to march. His affection must be\r\nmet with larger love; his patience rewarded with privilege; his courage\r\ncalled to defend the rights of others rather than redress his own wrongs.\r\nThus shall he supplement from within the best efforts of good men without.\r\n\r\nTo cure the evils entailed upon him by an unhappy past, he must be\r\neducated to work with skill, with self-direction, in combination and\r\nunremittingly. Industrial education with constant application, is the\r\nslogan of his rise from racial pauperism to productive manliness. Not that\r\nexceptional minds should not have exceptional opportunities (and they\r\nalready exist); but that the great majority of awkward and unskilled ones,\r\nwho must work somehow, somewhere, all the time, shall have their\r\nopportunities for training in industrial schools near them and with\r\ncourses consonant with the lives they are to lead. Let the ninety and nine\r\nwho must work, either with trained or fumbling hands, have a chance. Train\r\nthe Negro to accept and carry responsibility by putting it upon him. Train\r\nhim, more than any schools are now doing, in morals--to speak the truth,\r\nto keep a promise, to touch only his own property, to trust the\r\ntrustworthy among his own race, to risk something in business, to strike\r\nout in new lines of endeavor, to buy houses and make homes, to regard\r\nbeauty as well as utility, to save rather than display. In short, let us\r\nsubordinate mere knowledge to the work of invigorating the will,\r\nenergizing productive effort and clarifying moral vision. Let us make safe\r\nmen rather than vociferous mountebanks; let us put deftness in daily labor\r\nabove sleight-of-hand tricks, and common sense, well trained, above\r\nclassical smatterings, which awe the multitude but butter no parsnips.\r\n\r\nIf we do this, America will have enriched her blood, ennobled her record\r\nand shown the world how to deal with its Dark Races without reproach.\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: In the original, this was 'Northen'.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: In the original, this was 'weeek'.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: In the original, this was 'seees'.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Representative American Negroes_\r\n\r\nBy PAUL LAURENCE DUNBAR\r\n\r\n  An enumeration of some of the noteworthy American Negroes of to-day and\r\n  yesterday, with some account of their lives and their work. In this\r\n  paper Mr. Dunbar has turned out his largest and most successful picture\r\n  of the colored people. It is a noble canvas crowded with heroic figures.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn considering who and what are representative Negroes there are\r\ncircumstances which compel one to question what is a representative man of\r\nthe colored race. Some men are born great, some achieve greatness and\r\nothers lived during the reconstruction period. To have achieved something\r\nfor the betterment of his race rather than for the aggrandizement of\r\nhimself, seems to be a man's best title to be called representative. The\r\nstreet corner politician, who through questionable methods or even through\r\nskillful manipulation, succeeds in securing the janitorship of the Court\r\nHouse, may be written up in the local papers as \"representative,\" but is\r\nhe?\r\n\r\nI have in mind a young man in Baltimore, Bernard Taylor by name, who to me\r\nis more truly representative of the race than half of the \"Judges,\"\r\n\"Colonels,\" \"Doctors\" and \"Honorables\" whose stock cuts burden the pages\r\nof our negro journals week after week. I have said that he is young.\r\nBeyond that he is quiet and unobtrusive; but quiet as he is, the worth of\r\nhis work can be somewhat estimated when it is known that he has set the\r\nstandard for young men in a city that has the largest colored population\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nIt is not that as an individual he has ridden to success one enterprise\r\nafter another. It is not that he has shown capabilities far beyond his\r\nyears, nor yet that his personal energy will not let him stop at one\r\ntriumph. The importance of him lies in the fact that his influence upon\r\nhis fellows is all for good, and in a large community of young Negroes the\r\nworth of this cannot be over-estimated. He has taught them that striving\r\nis worth while, and by the very force of his example of industry and\r\nperseverance, he stands out from the mass. He does not tell how to do\r\nthings, he does them. Nothing has contributed more to his success than\r\nhis alertness, and nothing has been more closely followed by his\r\nobservers, and yet I sometimes wonder when looking at him, how old he must\r\nbe, how world weary, before the race turns from its worship of the\r\npolitical janitor and says of him, \"this is one of our representative\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\nThis, however, is a matter of values and neither the negro himself, his\r\nfriends, his enemies, his lauders, nor his critics has grown quite certain\r\nin appraising these. The rabid agitator who goes about the land preaching\r\nthe independence and glory of his race, and by his very mouthings\r\nretarding both, the saintly missionary, whose only mission is like that of\r\n\"Pooh Bah,\" to be insulted; the man of the cloth who thunders against the\r\nsins of the world and from whom honest women draw away their skirts, the\r\nman who talks temperance and tipples high-balls--these are not\r\nrepresentative, and whatever their station in life, they should be rated\r\nat their proper value, for there is a difference between attainment and\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\nUnder the pure light of reason, the ignorant carpet bagger judge is a\r\nperson and not a personality. The illiterate and inefficient black man,\r\nwhom circumstance put into Congress, was \"a representative\" but was not\r\nrepresentative. So the peculiar conditions of the days immediately after\r\nthe war have made it necessary to draw fine distinctions.\r\n\r\nWhen Robert Smalls, a slave, piloted the Confederate ship Planter out of\r\nCharleston Harbor under the very guns of the men who were employing him,\r\nwho owned him, his body, his soul, and the husk of his allegiance, and\r\nbrought it over to the Union, it is a question which forty years has not\r\nsettled as to whether he was a hero or a felon, a patriot or a traitor. So\r\nmuch has been said of the old Negro's fidelity to his masters that\r\nsomething different might have been expected of him. But take the singular\r\nconditions: the first faint streaks of a long delayed dawn had just begun\r\nto illumine the sky and this black pilot with his face turned toward the\r\nEast had no eye for the darkness behind him. He had no time to analyze his\r\nposition, the right or wrong of it. He had no opportunity to question\r\nwhether it was loyalty to a union in which he aspired to citizenship, or\r\ndisloyalty to his masters of the despised confederacy. It was not a time\r\nto argue, it was a time to do; and with rare power of decision, skill of\r\naction and with indomitable courage, he steered the good ship Planter past\r\nFort Johnson, past Fort Sumter, past Morris Island, out where the flag,\r\nthe flag of his hopes and fears floated over the federal fleet. And Robert\r\nSmalls had done something, something that made him loved and hated,\r\npraised and maligned, revered and despised, but something that made him\r\nrepresentative of the best that there is in sturdy Negro manhood.\r\n\r\nIt may seem a far cry from Robert Smalls, the pilot of the Planter, to\r\nBooker T. Washington, Principal of the Institute at Tuskegee, Alabama.\r\nBut much the same traits of character have made the success of the two\r\nmen; the knowledge of what to do, the courage to do it, and the following\r\nout of a single purpose. They are both pilots, and the waters through\r\nwhich their helms have swung have been equally stormy. The methods of both\r\nhave been questioned; but singularly neither one has stopped to question\r\nhimself, but has gone straight on to his goal over the barriers of\r\ncriticism, malice and distrust. The secret of Mr. Washington's power is\r\norganization, and organization after all is only a concentration of force.\r\nThis concentration only expresses his own personality, in which every\r\ntrait and quality tend toward one definite end. They say of this man that\r\nhe is a man of one idea, but that one is a great one and he has merely\r\nconcentrated all his powers upon it; in other words he has organized\r\nhimself and gone forth to gather in whatever about him was essential.\r\n\r\nPilot he is, steadfast and unafraid, strong in his own belief,--yes\r\nstrong enough to make others believe in him. Without doubt or skepticism,\r\nhimself he has confounded the skeptics.\r\n\r\nLess statesmanlike than Douglass, less scholarly than DuBois, less\r\neloquent than the late J.C. Price, he is yet the foremost figure in Negro\r\nnational life. He is a great educator and a great man, and though one may\r\nnot always agree with him, one must always respect him. The race has\r\nproduced no more adroit diplomatist than he. The statement is broad but\r\nthere is no better proof of it than the fact that while he is our most\r\nastute politician, he has succeeded in convincing both himself and the\r\ncountry that he is not in politics. He has none of the qualities of the\r\ncurb-stone politician. He is bigger, broader, better, and the highest\r\ncompliment that could be paid him is that through all his ups and downs,\r\nwith all he has seen of humanity, he has kept his faith and his ideals.\r\nWhile Mr. Washington stands pre-eminent in his race there are other names\r\nthat must be mentioned with him as co-workers in the education of the\r\nworld, names that for lack of time can be only mentioned and passed.\r\n\r\nW.H. Council, of Normal, Alabama, has been doing at his school a good and\r\ngreat work along the same lines as Tuskegee. R.R. Wright, of the State\r\nCollege of Georgia, \"We'se a-risin' Wright,\" he is called, and by his own\r\nlife and work for his people he has made true the boyish prophecy which in\r\nthe old days inspired Whittier's poem. Three decades ago this was his\r\nmessage from the lowly South, \"Tell 'em we'se a-risin,\" and by thought, by\r\nword, by deed, he has been \"Tellin' em so\" ever since. The old Southern\r\nschool has melted into the misty shades of an unregretted past. A new\r\ngeneration, new issues, new conditions, have replaced the old, but the boy\r\nwho sent that message from the heart of the Southland to the North's heart\r\nof hearts has risen, and a martyred President did not blush to call him\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nSo much of the Negro's time has been given to the making of teachers that\r\nit is difficult to stop when one has begun enumerating some of those who\r\nhave stood out more than usually forceful. For my part, there are two more\r\nwhom I cannot pass over. Kelly Miller, of Howard University, Washington,\r\nD.C., is another instructor far above the average. He is a mathematician\r\nand a thinker. The world has long been convinced of what the colored man\r\ncould do in music and in oratory, but it has always been skeptical, when\r\nhe is to be considered as a student of any exact science. Miller, in his\r\nown person, has settled all that. He finished at Johns Hopkins where they\r\nwill remember him. He is not only a teacher but an author who writes with\r\nauthority upon his chosen themes, whether he is always known as a Negro\r\nwriter or not. He is endowed with an accurate, analytical mind, and the\r\nmost engaging blackness, for which some of us thank God, because there can\r\nbe no argument as to the source of his mental powers.\r\n\r\nNow of the other, William E.B. DuBois, what shall be said? Educator and\r\nauthor, political economist and poet, an Eastern man against a Southern\r\nback-ground, he looms up strong, vivid and in bold relief. I say looms\r\nadvisedly, because, intellectually, there is something so distinctively\r\nbig about the man. Since the death of the aged Dr. Crummell, we have had\r\nno such ripe and finished scholar. Dr. DuBois, Harvard gave him to us, and\r\nthere he received his Ph.D., impresses one as having reduced all life and\r\nall literature to a perfect system. There is about him a fascinating calm\r\nof certain power, whether as a searcher after economic facts, under the\r\nwing of the University of Pennsylvania, or defying the \"powers that be\" in\r\na Negro college or leading his pupils along the way of light, one always\r\nfeels in him this same sense of conscious, restrained, but assured force.\r\n\r\nSome years ago in the course of his researches, he took occasion to tell\r\nhis own people some plain hard truths, and oh, what a howl of protest and\r\ndenunciation went up from their assembled throats, but it never once\r\ndisturbed his magnificent calm. He believed what he had said, and not for\r\na single moment did he think of abandoning his position.\r\n\r\nHe goes at truth as a hard-riding old English squire would take a\r\ndifficult fence. Let the ditch be beyond if it will.\r\n\r\nDr. DuBois would be the first to disclaim the name of poet but everything\r\noutside of his statistical work convicts him. The rhythm of his style, his\r\nfancy, his imagery, all bid him bide with those whose souls go singing by\r\na golden way. He has written a number of notable pamphlets and books, the\r\nlatest of which is \"The Soul of the Black Folk,\" an invaluable\r\ncontribution to the discussion of the race problem by a man who knows\r\nwhereof he speaks.\r\n\r\nDr. DuBois is at Atlanta University and has had every opportunity to\r\nobserve all the phases of America's great question, and I wish I might\r\nwrite at length of his books.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged that too much time has already been taken up with the\r\neducational side of the Negro, but the reasonableness of this must become\r\napparent when one remembers that for the last forty years the most helpful\r\nmen of the race have come from the ranks of its teachers, and few of those\r\nwho have finally done any big thing, but have at some time or other held\r\nthe scepter of authority in a school. They may have changed later and\r\ngrown, indeed they must have done so, but the fact remains that their\r\npoise, their discipline, the impulse for their growth came largely from\r\ntheir work in the school room.\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no more notable example of this phase of Negro life than\r\nthe Hon. Richard Theodore Greener, our present Consul at Vladivostok. He\r\nwas, I believe, the first of our race to graduate from Harvard and he has\r\nalways been regarded as one of the most scholarly men who, through the\r\ntouch of Negro blood, belongs to us. He has been historian, journalist and\r\nlecturer, but back of all this he was a teacher; and for years after his\r\ngraduation he was a distinguished professor at the most famous of all the\r\nold Negro colleges. This institution is now a thing of the past, but the\r\nmen who knew it in its palmy days speak of it still with longing and\r\nregret. It is claimed, and from the names and qualities of the men, not\r\nwithout justice, that no school for the higher education of the black man\r\nhas furnished a finer curriculum or possessed a better equipped or more\r\nefficient faculty. Among these, Richard T. Greener was a bright,\r\nparticular star.\r\n\r\nAfter the passing of the school, Mr. Greener turned to other activities.\r\nHis highest characteristics were a fearless patience and a hope that\r\nbuoyed him up through days of doubt and disappointment. Author and editor\r\nhe was, but he was not satisfied with these. Beyond their scope were\r\nhigher things that beckoned him. Politics, or perhaps better, political\r\nscience, allured him, and he applied himself to a course that brought him\r\ninto intimate contact with the leaders of his country, white and black. A\r\nman of wide information, great knowledge and close grasp of events he made\r\nhimself invaluable to his party and then with his usual patience awaited\r\nhis reward.\r\n\r\nThe story of how he came to his own cannot be told without just a shade of\r\nbitterness darkening the smile that one must give to it all. The cause for\r\nwhich he had worked triumphed. The men for whom he had striven gained\r\ntheir goal and now, Greener must be recognized, but--\r\n\r\nVladivostok, your dictionary will tell you, is a sea-port in the maritime\r\nProvince of Siberia, situated on the Golden Horn of Peter the Great. It\r\nwill tell you also that it is the chief Russian naval station on the\r\nPacific. It is an out of the way place and one who has not the\r\nworld-circling desire would rather hesitate before setting out thither. It\r\nwas to this post that Mr. Greener was appointed.\r\n\r\n\"Exile,\" his friends did not hesitate to say. \"Why didn't the Government\r\nmake it a sentence instead of veiling it in the guise of an appointment?\"\r\nasked others sarcastically.\r\n\r\n\"Will he go?\" That was the general question that rose and fell, whispered\r\nand thundered about the new appointee, and in the midst of it all, silent\r\nand dignified, he kept his council. The next thing Washington knew he was\r\ngone. There was a gasp of astonishment and then things settled back into\r\ntheir former state of monotony and Greener was forgotten.\r\n\r\nBut in the eastern sky, darkness began to arise, the warning flash of\r\ndanger swept across the heavens, the thunder drum of war began to roll.\r\nFor a moment the world listened in breathless suspense, the suspense of\r\nhorror. Louder and louder rose the thunder peal until it drowned every\r\nother sound in the ears of the nation, every other sound save the cries\r\nand wails of dying women and the shrieks of tortured children. Then\r\nFrance, England, Germany, Japan and America marshalled their forces and\r\nswept eastward to save and to avenge. The story of the Boxer uprising has\r\nbeen told, but little has been said of how Vladivostok, \"A sea-port in the\r\nmaritime Province of Siberia,\" became one of the most important points of\r\ncommunication with the outside world, and its Consul came frequently to be\r\nheard from by the State Department. And so Greener after years of patience\r\nand toil had come to his own. If the government had wished to get him out\r\nof the way, it had reckoned without China.\r\n\r\nA new order of things has come into Negro-American politics and this man\r\nhas become a part of it. It matters not that he began his work under the\r\nold regime. So did Judge Gibbs, a man eighty years of age, but he, too,\r\nhas kept abreast of the times, and although the reminiscences in his\r\ndelightful autobiography take one back to the hazy days when the land was\r\nyoung and politics a more strenuous thing than it is even now, when there\r\nwas anarchy in Louisiana and civil war in Arkansas, when one shot first\r\nand questioned afterward; yet because his mind is still active, because\r\nhe has changed his methods with the changing time, because his influence\r\nover young men is greatly potent still; he is, in the race, perhaps, the\r\nbest representative of what the old has brought to the new.\r\n\r\nBeside him strong, forceful, commanding, stands the figure of George H.\r\nWhite, whose farewell speech before the Fifty-sixth Congress, when through\r\nthe disfranchisement of Negroes he was defeated for re-election, stirred\r\nthe country and fired the hearts of his brothers. He has won his place\r\nthrough honesty, bravery and aggressiveness. He has given something to the\r\nnation that the nation needed, and with such men as Pinchback, Lynch,\r\nTerrell and others of like ilk, acting in concert, it is but a matter of\r\ntime when his worth shall induce a repentant people, with a justice\r\nbuilded upon the foundation of its old prejudice, to ask the Negro back to\r\ntake a hand in the affairs of state.\r\n\r\nAdd to all this the facts that the Negro has his representatives in the\r\ncommercial world: McCoy and Granville T. Woods, inventors; in the\r\nagricultural world with J.H. Groves, the potato king of Kansas, who last\r\nyear shipped from his own railway siding seventy-two thousand five hundred\r\nbushels of potatoes alone; in the military, with Capt. Charles A. Young, a\r\nWest Pointer, now stationed at the Presidio; that in medicine, he\r\npossesses in Daniel H. Williams, of Chicago, one of the really great\r\nsurgeons of the country; that Edward H. Morris, a black man, is one of the\r\nmost brilliant lawyers at the brilliant Cook County bar; that in every\r\nwalk of life he has men and women who stand for something definite and\r\nconcrete, and it seems to me that there can be little doubt that the race\r\nproblem will gradually solve itself.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of \"men and women,\" and indeed the women must not be\r\nforgotten, for to them the men look for much of the inspiration and\r\nimpulse that drives them forward to success. Mrs. Mary Church Terrell\r\nupon the platform speaking for Negro womanhood and Miss Sarah Brown, her\r\ndirect opposite, a little woman sitting up in her aerie above a noisy New\r\nYork street, stand for the very best that there is in our mothers, wives\r\nand sisters. The one fully in the public eye, with learning and eloquence,\r\ntelling the hopes and fears of her kind; the other in suffering and\r\nretirement, with her knowledge of the human heart and her gentleness\r\ninspiring all who meet her to better and nobler lives. They are both doing\r\ntheir work bravely and grandly. But when the unitiate ask who is \"la\r\nPetite Reine,\" we think of the quiet little woman in a New York fifth\r\nfloor back and are silent.\r\n\r\nShe is a patron of all our literature and art and we have both. Whether it\r\nis a new song by Will Marion Cook or a new book by DuBois or Chestnut,\r\nthan whom no one has ever told the life of the Negro more accurately and\r\nconvincingly, she knows it and has a kindly word of praise or\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\nIn looking over the field for such an article as this, one just begins to\r\nrealize how many Negroes are representative of something, and now it seems\r\nthat in closing no better names could be chosen than those of the two\r\nTanners.\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial, Religion and Art have gone together, but it remained\r\nfor us to place them in the persons of these two men, in the relation of\r\nfather and son. Bishop Benj. Tucker Tanner, of the A.M.E. Church, is not\r\nonly a theologian and a priest, he is a dignified, polished man of the\r\nhigher world and a poet. He has succeeded because he was prepared for\r\nsuccess. As to his writings, he will, perhaps, think most highly of \"His\r\nApology For African Methodism;\" but some of us, while respecting this,\r\nwill turn from it to the poems and hymns that have sung themselves out of\r\nhis gentle heart.\r\n\r\nIs it any wonder that his son, Henry O. Tanner, is a poet with the brush\r\nor that the French Government has found it out? From the father must have\r\ncome the man's artistic impulse, and he carried it on and on to a golden\r\nfruition. In the Luxembourg gallery hangs his picture, \"The Raising of\r\nLazarus.\" At the Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia, I saw his\r\n\"Annunciation,\" both a long way from his \"Banjo Lesson,\" and thinking of\r\nhim I began to wonder whether, in spite of all the industrial tumult, it\r\nwere not in the field of art, music and literature that the Negro was to\r\nmake his highest contribution to American civilization. But this is merely\r\na question which time will answer.\r\n\r\nAll these of whom I have spoken are men who have striven and achieved and\r\nthe reasons underlying their success are the same that account for the\r\nadvancement of men of any other race: preparation, perseverance, bravery,\r\npatience, honesty and the power to seize the opportunity.\r\n\r\nIt is a little dark still, but there are warnings of the day and somewhere\r\nout of the darkness a bird is singing to the Dawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Negro's Place in American Life at the Present Day_\r\n\r\nBY T. THOMAS FORTUNE\r\n\r\n  Considering the two hundred and forty-five years of his slavery and the\r\n  comparatively short time he has enjoyed the opportunities of freedom,\r\n  his place in American life at the present day is creditable to him and\r\n  promising for the future.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: T. THOMAS FORTUNE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be no healthy growth in the life of a race or a nation without a\r\nself-reliant spirit animating the whole body; if it amounts to optimism,\r\ndevoid of egotism and vanity, so much the better. This spirit necessarily\r\ncarries with it intense pride of race, or of nation, as the case may be,\r\nand ramifies the whole mass, inspiring and shaping its thought and effort,\r\nhowever humble or exalted these may be,--as it takes \"all sorts and\r\nconditions of men\" to make up a social order, instinct with the ambition\r\nand the activity which work for \"high thinking and right living,\" of which\r\nmodern evolution in all directions is the most powerful illustration in\r\nhistory. If pride of ancestry can, happily, be added to pride of race and\r\nnation, and these are re-enforced by self-reliance, courage and correct\r\nmoral living, the possible success of such people may be accepted, without\r\nequivocation, as a foregone conclusion. I have found all of these\r\nrequirements so finely blended in the life and character of no people as\r\nthat of the Japanese, who are just now emerging from \"the double night of\r\nages\" into the vivifying sunlight of modern progress.\r\n\r\nWhat is the Negro's place in American life at the present day?\r\n\r\nThe answer depends entirely upon the point of view. Unfortunately for the\r\nAfro-American people, they have no pride of ancestry; in the main, few of\r\nthem can trace their parentage back four generations; and the \"daughter of\r\nan hundred earls\" of whom there are probably many, is unconscious of her\r\ndescent, and would profit nothing by it if this were not true. The blood\r\nof all the ethnic types that go to make up American citizenship flows in\r\nthe veins of the Afro-American people, so that of the ten million of them\r\nin this country, accounted for by the Federal census, not more than four\r\nmillion are of pure negroid descent, while some four million of them, not\r\naccounted for by the Federal census, have escaped into the ranks of the\r\nwhite race, and are re-enforced very largely by such escapements every\r\nyear. The vitiation of blood has operated irresistibly to weaken that\r\npride of ancestry, which is the foundation-stone of pride of race; so that\r\nthe Afro-American people have been held together rather by the segregation\r\ndecreed by law and public opinion than by ties of consanguinity since\r\ntheir manumission and enfranchisement. It is not because they are poor and\r\nignorant and oppressed, as a mass, that there is no such sympathy of\r\nthought and unity of effort among them as among Irishmen and Jews the\r\nworld over, but because the vitiation of blood, beyond the honorable\r\nrestrictions of law, has destroyed, in large measure, that pride of\r\nancestry upon which pride of race must be builded. In no other logical\r\nway can we account for the failure of the Afro-American people to stand\r\ntogether, as other oppressed races do, and have done, for the righting of\r\nwrongs against them authorized by the laws of the several states, if not\r\nby the Federal Constitution, and sanctioned or tolerated by public\r\nopinion. In nothing has this radical defect been more noticeable since the\r\nWar of the Rebellion than in the uniform failure of the people to sustain\r\nsuch civic organizations as exist and have existed, to test in the courts\r\nof law and in the forum of public opinion the validity of organic laws of\r\nStates intended to deprive them of the civil and political rights\r\nguaranteed to them by the Federal Constitution. The two such organizations\r\nof this character which have appealed to them are the National\r\nAfro-American League, organized in Chicago, in 1890, and the National\r\nAfro-American Council, organized in Rochester, New York, out of the\r\nLeague, in 1898. The latter organization still exists, the strongest of\r\nits kind, but it has never commanded the sympathy and support of the\r\nmasses of the people, nor is there, or has there been, substantial\r\nagreement and concert of effort among the thoughtful men of the race along\r\nthese lines. They have been restrained by selfish, personal and petty\r\nmotives, while the constitutional rights which vitalize their citizenship\r\nhave been \"denied or abridged\" by legislation of certain of the States and\r\nby public opinion, even as Nero fiddled while Rome burned. If they had\r\nbeen actuated by a strong pride of ancestry and of race, if they had felt\r\nthat injury to one was injury to all, if they had hung together instead of\r\nhanging separately, their place in the civil and political life of the\r\nRepublic to-day would not be that, largely, of pariahs, with none so poor\r\nas to do them honor, but that of equality of right under the law enjoyed\r\nby all other alien ethnic forces in our citizenship. They who will not\r\nhelp themselves are usually not helped by others. They who make a loud\r\nnoise and courageously contend for what is theirs, usually enjoy the\r\nrespect and confidence of their fellows and get, in the end, what belongs\r\nto them, or a reasonable modification of it.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of inability to unite in thought and effort for the\r\nconservation of their civil and political rights, the Afro-American\r\nNegroes and colored people have lost, by fundamental enactments of the old\r\nslave-holding States, all of the civil and political rights guaranteed\r\nthem by the Federal Constitution, in the full enjoyment of which they were\r\nfrom the adoption of the War Amendments up to 1876-7, when they were\r\nsacrificed by their Republican allies of the North and West, in the\r\nalienation of their State governments, in order to save the Presidency to\r\nMr. Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio. Their reverses in this matter in the old\r\nslave-holding States, coupled with a vast mass of class legislation,\r\nmodelled on the slave code, have affected the Afro-American people in\r\ntheir civil and political rights in all of the States of the Republic,\r\nespecially as far as public opinion is concerned. This was inevitable,\r\nand follows in every instance in history where a race element of the\r\ncitizenship is set aside by law or public opinion as separate and distinct\r\nfrom its fellows, with a fixed status or caste.\r\n\r\nIt will take the Afro-American people fully a century to recover what they\r\nlost of civil and political equality under the law in the Southern States,\r\nas a result of the re-actionary and bloody movement begun in the\r\nReconstruction period by the Southern whites, and culminating in\r\n1877,--the excesses of the Reconstruction governments, about which so much\r\nis said to the discredit of the Negro, being chargeable to the weakness\r\nand corruption of Northern carpet-baggers, who were the master and\r\nresponsible spirits of the time and the situation, rather than to the\r\nweakness, the ignorance and venality of their Negro dupes, who, very\r\nnaturally, followed where they led, as any other grateful people would\r\nhave done. For, were not these same Northern carpet-baggers the direct\r\nrepresentatives of the Government and the Army which crushed the slave\r\npower and broke the shackles of the slave? Even so. The Northern\r\ncarpet-baggers planned and got the plunder, and have it; the Negro got the\r\ncredit and the odium, and have them yet. It often happens that way in\r\nhistory, that the innocent dupes are made to suffer for the misdeeds and\r\ncrimes of the guilty.\r\n\r\nThe recovery of civil and political rights under the Constitution, as\r\n\"denied or abridged\" by the constitutions of the States, more especially\r\nthose of the old slave holding ones, will be a slow and tedious process,\r\nand will come to the individual rather than to the race, as the reward of\r\ncharacter and thrift; because, for reasons already stated, it will hardly\r\nbe possible in the future, as it has not been in the past, to unify the\r\nmass of the Afro-American people, in thought and conduct, for a proper\r\ncontention in the courts and at the ballot-box and in the education of\r\npublic opinion, to accomplish this purpose. Perhaps there is no other\r\ninstance in history where everything depended so largely upon the\r\nindividual, and so little upon the mass of his race, for that development\r\nin the religious and civic virtues which makes more surely for an\r\nhonorable status in any citizenship than constitutions or legislative\r\nenactments built upon them.\r\n\r\nBut even from this point of view, I am disposed to believe that the\r\nNegro's civil and political rights are more firmly fixed in law and public\r\nopinion than was true at the close of the Reconstruction period, when\r\neverything relating to him was unsettled and confused, based in\r\nlegislative guarantees, subject to approval or disapproval of the dominant\r\npublic opinion of the several States, and that he will gradually work out\r\nhis own salvation under the Constitution,--such as Charles Sumner,\r\nThaddeus Stevens, Benjamin F. Butler, Frederick Douglass, and their\r\nco-workers, hoped and labored that he might enjoy. He has lost nothing\r\nunder the fundamental law; such of these restrictions, as apply to him by\r\nthe law of certain of the States, necessarily apply to white men in like\r\ncircumstances of ignorance and poverty, and can be overcome, in time, by\r\nassiduous courtship of the schoolmaster and the bank cashier. The extent\r\nto which the individual members of the race are overcoming the\r\nrestrictions made a bar to their enjoyment of civil and political rights\r\nunder the Constitution is gratifying to those who wish the race well and\r\nwho look beyond the present into the future: while it is disturbing the\r\ndreams of those who spend most of their time and thought in abortive\r\nefforts to \"keep the 'nigger' in his place\"--as if any man or race could\r\nhave a place in the world's thought and effort which he did not make for\r\nhimself! In our grand Republic, at least, it has been so often\r\ndemonstrated as to become proverbial, that the door of opportunity shall\r\nbe closed to no man, and that he shall be allowed to have that place in\r\nour national life which he makes for himself. So it is with the Negro now,\r\nas an individual. Will it be so with him in the future as a race? To\r\nanswer that we shall first have to determine that he has a race.\r\n\r\nHowever he may be lacking in pride of ancestry and race, no one can accuse\r\nthe Negro of lack of pride of Nation and State, and even of county.\r\nIndeed, his pride in the Republic and his devotion to it are among the\r\nmost pathetic phases of his pathetic history, from Jamestown, in 1620, to\r\nSan Juan Hill, in 1898. He has given everything to the Republic,--his\r\nlabor and blood and prayers. What has the Republic given him, but blows\r\nand rebuffs and criminal ingratitude! And he stands now, ready and eager,\r\nto give the Republic all that he has. What does the Republic stand ready\r\nand eager to give him? Let the answer come out of the mouth of the future.\r\n\r\nIt is a fair conclusion that the Negro has a firmer and more assured civil\r\nand political status in American life to-day than at the close of the\r\nReconstruction period, paradoxical as this may appear to many, despite the\r\nadverse legislation of the old slave-holding States, and the tolerant\r\nfavor shown such legislation by the Federal Supreme Court, in such\r\nopinions as it has delivered, from time to time, upon the subject, since\r\nthe adoption of the War amendments to the Federal Constitution.\r\nTechnically, the Negro stands upon equality with all other citizens under\r\nthis large body of special and class legislation; but, as a matter of\r\nfact, it is so framed that the greatest inequality prevails, and was\r\nintended to prevail, in the administration of it by the several States\r\nchiefly concerned. As long as such legislation by the States specifies, on\r\nthe face of it, that it shall operate upon all citizens equally, however\r\nunequally and unjustly the legislation may be interpreted and administered\r\nby the local courts, the Federal Supreme Court has held, time and again,\r\nthat no hardship was worked, and, if so, that the aggrieved had his\r\nrecourse in appeal to the higher courts of the State of which he is a\r\ncitizen,--a recourse at this time precisely like that of carrying coal to\r\nNew Castle.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, there is no alternative for the Negro citizen\r\nbut to work out his salvation under the Constitution, as other citizens\r\nhave done and are doing. It will be a long and tedious process before the\r\nequitable adjustment has been attained, but that does not much matter, as\r\nfull and fair enjoyment of civil and political rights requires much time\r\nand patience and hard labor in any given situation, where two races come\r\ntogether in the same governmental environment; such as is the case of the\r\nNegro in America, the Irishman in Ireland, and the Jew everywhere in\r\nEurope. It is just as well, perhaps, that the Negro will have to work out\r\nhis salvation under the Constitution as an individual rather than as a\r\nrace, as the Jew has done it in Great Britain and as the Irishman will\r\nhave to do it under the same Empire, as it is and has been the tendency of\r\nour law and precedent to subordinate race elements and to exalt the\r\nindividual citizens as indivisible \"parts of one stupendous whole.\" When\r\nthis has been accomplished by the law in the case of the Negro, as in the\r\ncase of other alien ethnic elements of the citizenship, it will be more\r\ngradually, but assuredly, accomplished by society at large, the\r\nindestructible foundation of which was laid by the reckless and brutal\r\nprostitution of black women by white men in the days of slavery, from\r\nwhich a vast army of mulattoes were produced, who have been and are,\r\ngradually, by honorable marriage among themselves, changing the alleged\r\n\"race characteristics and tendencies\" of the Negro people. A race element,\r\nit is safe and fair to conclude, incapable, like that of the North\r\nAmerican Indian, of such a process of elimination and assimilation, will\r\nalways be a thorn in the flesh of the Republic, in which there is,\r\nadmittedly, no place for the integrality and growth of a distinct race\r\ntype. The Afro-American people, for reasons that I have stated, are even\r\nnow very far from being such a distinct race type, and without further\r\nadmixture of white and black blood, will continue to be less so to the end\r\nof the chapter. It seems to me that this view of the matter has not\r\nreceived the consideration that it deserves at the hands of those who set\r\nthemselves up as past grand masters in the business of \"solving the race\r\nproblem,\" and in accurately defining \"The Negro's Place in American Life\r\nat the Present Day.\" The negroid type and the Afro-American type are two\r\nvery distinct types, and the sociologist who confounds them, as is very\r\ngenerally done, is bound to confuse his subject and his audience.\r\n\r\nIt is a debatable question as to whether the Negro's present industrial\r\nposition is better or worse than it was, say, at the close of the\r\nReconstruction period. As a mass, I am inclined to the opinion that it is\r\nworse, as the laws of the States where he is congregated most numerously\r\nare so framed as to favor the employer in every instance, and he does not\r\nscruple to get all out of the industrial slave that he can; which is, in\r\nthe main, vastly more than the slave master got, as the latter was at the\r\nexpense of housing, feeding, clothing and providing medical service for\r\nhis chattel, while the former is relieved of this expense and trouble.\r\nProf. W.E.B. DuBois, of Atlanta University, who has made a critical study\r\nof the rural Negro of the Southern States, sums up the industrial phase of\r\nthe matter in the following (\"The Souls of Black Folk,\" pp. 39-40):\r\n\r\n\"For this much all men know: Despite compromise, war and struggle, the\r\nNegro is not free. In the backwoods of the Gulf States, for miles and\r\nmiles, he may not leave the plantation of his birth; in well-nigh the\r\nwhole rural South the black farmers are peons, bound by law and custom to\r\nan economic slavery, from which the only escape is death or the\r\npenitentiary. In the most cultured sections and cities of the South the\r\nNegroes are a segregated servile caste, with restricted rights and\r\nprivileges. Before the courts, both in law and custom, they stand on a\r\ndifferent and peculiar basis. Taxation without representation is the rule\r\nof their political life. And the result of all this is, and in nature must\r\nhave been, lawlessness and crime.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a dark and gloomy picture, the substitution of industrial for\r\nchattel slavery, with none of the legal and selfish restraints upon the\r\nemployer which surrounded and actuated the master. And this is true of the\r\nentire mass of the Afro-American laborers of the Southern States. Out of\r\nthe mass have arisen a large number of individuals who own and till their\r\nown lands. This element is very largely recruited every year, and to this\r\nsource must we look for the gradual undermining of the industrial slavery\r\nof the mass of the people. Here, too, we have a long and tedious process\r\nof evolution, but it is nothing new in the history of races circumstanced\r\nas the Afro-American people are. That the Negro is destined, however, to\r\nbe the landlord and master agriculturist of the Southern States is a\r\nprobability sustained by all the facts in the situation; not the least of\r\nwhich being the tendency of the poor white class and small farmers to\r\nabandon agricultural pursuits for those of the factory and the mine, from\r\nwhich the Negro laborer is excluded, partially in the mine and wholly in\r\nthe factory. The development of mine and factory industries in the\r\nSouthern States in the past two decades has been one of the most\r\nremarkable in industrial history.\r\n\r\nIn the skilled trades, at the close of the War of the Rebellion, most of\r\nthe work was done by Negroes educated as artisans in the hard school of\r\nslavery, but there has been a steady decline in the number of such\r\nlaborers, not because of lack of skill, but because trade unionism has\r\ngradually taken possession of such employments in the South, and will not\r\nallow the Negro to work alongside of the white man. And this is the rule\r\nof the trade unions in all parts of the country. It is to be hoped that\r\nthere may be a gradual broadening of the views of white laborers in this\r\nvital matter and a change of attitude by the trade unions that they\r\ndominate. Can we reasonably expect this? As matters now stand, it is the\r\nindividual Negro artisan, often a master contractor, who can work at his\r\ntrade and give employment to his fellows. Fortunately, there are a great\r\nmany of these in all parts of the Southern States, and their number is\r\nincreasing every year, as the result of the rapid growth and high favor of\r\nindustrial schools, where the trades are taught. A very great deal should\r\nbe expected from this source, as a Negro contractor stands very nearly on\r\nas good footing as a white one in the bidding, when he has established a\r\nreputation for reliability. The facts obtained in every Southern city bear\r\nout this view of the matter. The individual black man has a fighting\r\nchance for success in the skilled trades; and, as he succeeds, will draw\r\nthe skilled mass after him. The proper solution of the skilled labor\r\nproblem is strictly within the power of the individual Negro. I believe\r\nthat he is solving it, and that he will ultimately solve it.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, in the marvellous building up of a legal, comfortable and\r\nhappy home life, where none whatever existed at the close of the War of\r\nthe Rebellion; in the no less stupendous development of the church life,\r\nwith large and puissant organizations that command the respect and\r\nadmiration of mankind, and owning splendid church property valued at\r\nmillions of dollars; in the quenchless thirst of the mass of the people\r\nfor useful knowledge, displayed at the close of the War of the Rebellion,\r\nand abating nothing of its intense keenness since, with the remarkable\r\nreduction in the illiteracy of the mass of the people, as is eloquently\r\ndisclosed by the census reports--it is in these results that no cause for\r\ncomplaint or discouragement can be found. The whole race here stands on\r\nimproved ground over that it occupied at the close of the War of the\r\nRebellion; albeit, even here, the individual has outstripped the mass of\r\nthe race, as it was but natural that he should and always will. But, while\r\nthis is true and gratifying to all those that hope the Afro-American\r\npeople well, it is also true, and equally gratifying that, as far as the\r\nmass is concerned, the home life, the church and the school house have\r\ncome into the life of the people, in some sort, everywhere, giving the\r\nwhole race a character and a standing in the estimation of mankind which\r\nit did not have at the close of the war, and presaging, logically, unless\r\nall signs fail, a development along high and honorable lines in the\r\nfuture; the results from which, I predict, at the end of the ensuing half\r\ncentury, builded upon the foundation already laid, being such as to\r\nconfound the prophets of evil, who never cease to doubt and shake their\r\nheads, asking: \"Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?\" We have the\r\nanswer already in the social and home life of the people, which is so vast\r\nan improvement over the conditions and the heritage of slavery as to\r\nstagger the understanding of those who are informed on the subject, or\r\nwill take the trouble to inform themselves.\r\n\r\nIf we have much loose moral living, it is not sanctioned by the mass,\r\nwedlock being the rule, and not the exception; if we have a vast volume of\r\nilliteracy, we have reduced it by forty per cent. since the war, and the\r\nschool houses are all full of children eager to learn, and the schools of\r\nhigher and industrial training cannot accommodate all those who knock at\r\ntheir doors for admission; if we have more than our share of criminality,\r\nwe have also churches in every hamlet and city, to which a vast majority\r\nof the people belong, and which are insistently pointing \"the way, the\r\nlight and the truth\" to higher and nobler living.\r\n\r\nMindful, therefore, of the Negro's two hundred and forty-five years of\r\nslave education and unrequited toil, and of his thirty years of partial\r\nfreedom and less than partial opportunity, who shall say that his place in\r\nAmerican life at the present day is not all that should be reasonably\r\nexpected of him, that it is not creditable to him, and that it is not a\r\nsufficient augury for better and nobler and higher thinking, striving and\r\nbuilding in the future? Social growth is the slowest of all growth. If\r\nthere be signs of growth, then, there is reasonable hope for a healthy\r\nmaturity. There are plenty of such signs, and he who runs may read them,\r\nif he will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Negro Problem, by Booker T. Washington, et al.",
