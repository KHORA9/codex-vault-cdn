RICHARDSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrefatory Note\r\n\r\nIn historic value this volume is equal to, if it does not surpass, any\r\none of the series which has preceded it. It comprises the eight years of\r\nour history from March 4, 1841, to March 4, 1849, and includes the four\r\nyears' term of Harrison and Tyler and also the term of James K. Polk.\r\nDuring the first half of this period the death of President Harrison\r\noccurred, when for the first time under the Constitution the\r\nVice-President succeeded to the office of President. As a matter of\r\npublic interest, several papers relating to the death of President\r\nHarrison are inserted. A number of highly interesting vetoes of\r\nPresident Tyler appear, among which are two vetoing bills chartering a\r\nUnited States bank and two vetoing tariff measures. During President\r\nTyler's Administration the protective tariff act of 1842 was passed; the\r\nsubtreasury law was repealed; the treaty with Great Britain of August 9,\r\n1842, was negotiated, settling the northeastern-boundary controversy,\r\nand providing for the final suppression of the African slave trade and\r\nfor the surrender of fugitive criminals; and acts establishing a uniform\r\nsystem of bankruptcy and providing for the distribution of the sales of\r\nthe public lands were passed. The treaty of annexation between the\r\nUnited States and the Republic of Texas was negotiated, but was rejected\r\nby the Senate.\r\n\r\nDuring the Administration of President Polk Texas was finally annexed to\r\nthe United States; Texas, Iowa, and Wisconsin were admitted into the\r\nUnion; the Oregon boundary was settled; the independent-treasury system\r\nwas reenacted; the Naval Academy was established; acts were passed\r\nestablishing the Smithsonian Institution and creating the Department of\r\nthe Interior; the war with Mexico was successfully fought, and the\r\nterritory known as New Mexico and Upper California was acquired. The\r\nacquisition of territory by Mr. Polk's Administration added to the\r\nUnited States California and New Mexico and portions of Colorado, Utah,\r\nand Nevada, a territory containing in all 1,193,061 square miles, or\r\nover 763,000,000 acres, and constituting a country more than half as\r\nlarge as all that held by the Republic before he became President. This\r\naddition to our domain was the next largest in area ever made. It was\r\nexceeded only by the purchase by President Jefferson of the Louisiana\r\nTerritory, in which was laid so deep the foundation of the country's\r\ngrowth and grandeur. If our country had not already attained that rank\r\nby the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory, the further additions\r\nmade by Mr. Polk's Administration advanced it at once to a continental\r\npower of assured strength and boundless promise.\r\n\r\nJAMES D. RICHARDSON.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 27, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry Harrison\r\n\r\nMarch 4 to April 4, 1841\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry Harrison\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry Harrison, third and youngest son of Benjamin Harrison, one\r\nof the signers of the Declaration of Independence, was born at Berkeley,\r\nCharles City County, Va., February 9, 1773. Was educated at Hampden\r\nSidney College, Virginia, and began the study of medicine, but before he\r\nhad finished it accounts of Indian outrages on the western frontier led\r\nhim to enter the Army, and he was commissioned an ensign in the First\r\nInfantry on August 16, 1791; joined his regiment at Fort Washington,\r\nOhio. Was appointed lieutenant June 2, 1792, and afterwards joined the\r\nArmy under General Anthony Wayne, and was made aid-de-camp to the\r\ncommanding officer. For his services in the expedition, in December,\r\n1793, that erected Fort Recovery he was thanked by name in general\r\norders. Participated in the engagements with the Indians that began on\r\nJune 30, 1794, and was complimented by General Wayne for gallantry in\r\nthe victory on the Miami on August 20. On May 15, 1797, was made captain\r\nand given the command of Fort Washington. While there he married Anna,\r\ndaughter of John Cleves Symmes. Resigned his commission on June 1, 1798,\r\npeace having been made with the Indians, and was immediately appointed\r\nby President John Adams secretary of the Northwest Territory, but in\r\nOctober, 1799, resigned to take his seat as Territorial Delegate in\r\nCongress. During his term part of the Northwest Territory was formed\r\ninto the Territory of Indiana, including the present States of Indiana,\r\nIllinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and he was appointed its governor and\r\nsuperintendent of Indian affairs, which he accepted, and resigned his\r\nseat in Congress. Was reappointed successively by Presidents Jefferson\r\nand Madison. He organized the legislature at Vincennes in 1805. Held\r\nfrequent councils with the Indians, and succeeded in averting many\r\noutbreaks. On September 30, 1809, concluded a treaty with several tribes\r\nby which they sold to the United States about 3,000,000 acres of land on\r\nthe Wabash and White rivers. This and former treaties were condemned by\r\nTecumseh and other chiefs, and an outbreak became imminent, which was\r\naverted by the conciliatory course of the governor. In the spring of\r\n1811 Indian depredations became frequent, and Governor Harrison\r\nrecommended the establishment of a military post at Tippecanoe, and the\r\nGovernment consented. On September 26 Harrison marched from Vincennes\r\nwith about 900 men, including 350 regular infantry, completed Fort\r\nHarrison, near the site of Terre Haute, Ind., on October 28, and leaving\r\na garrison there pressed on toward Tippecanoe. On November 6, when near\r\nthat town, was met by messengers demanding a parley, and a council was\r\nproposed for the next day. At 4 o'clock the following morning a fierce\r\nattack was made by the savages; at daybreak the Indians were driven from\r\nthe field. For this victory he was highly complimented by President\r\nMadison in his message of December 18, 1811, and was also thanked by the\r\nlegislatures of Kentucky and Indiana. On August 25, 1812, soon after war\r\nwas declared against Great Britain, was commissioned major-general of\r\nthe militia of Kentucky, though not a citizen of that State. On August\r\n22, 1812, was commissioned a brigadier-general in the Regular Army, and\r\nlater was appointed to the chief command of the Northwestern army, with\r\ninstructions to act in all cases according to his own discretion and\r\njudgment. No latitude as great as this had been given to any commander\r\nsince Washington. On March 2, 1813, was commissioned a major-general.\r\nWas in command of Fort Meigs when General Proctor, with a force of\r\nBritish troops and Indians, laid unsuccessful siege to it from April 28\r\nto May 9, 1813. Transporting his army to Canada, he fought the battle of\r\nthe Thames on October 5, defeating General Proctor's army of 800\r\nregulars and 1,200 Indians, the latter led by the celebrated Tecumseh,\r\nwho was killed. This battle, together with Perry's victory on Lake Erie,\r\ngave the United States possession of the chain of lakes above Erie and\r\nput an end to the war in uppermost Canada. For this victory he was\r\npraised by President Madison in his annual message to Congress and by\r\nthe legislatures of the different States. Through a misunderstanding\r\nwith General John Armstrong, Secretary of War, he resigned his\r\ncommission in the Army May 31, 1814. In 1814, and again in 1815, he was\r\nappointed on commissions that concluded Indian treaties, and in 1816 was\r\nchosen to Congress to fill a vacancy, serving till 1819. On March 30,\r\n1818, Congress unanimously voted him a gold medal for his victory of the\r\nThames. In 1819 he was chosen to the senate of Ohio, and in 1822 was an\r\nunsuccessful candidate for Congress. In 1824 was a Presidential elector,\r\nvoting for Henry Clay, and in the same year was sent to the United\r\nStates Senate, and succeeded Andrew Jackson as chairman of the Committee\r\non Military Affairs. He resigned in 1828, having been appointed by\r\nPresident John Quincy Adams minister to the United States of Colombia.\r\nHe was recalled at the outset of Jackson's Administration, and retired\r\nto his farm at North Bend, near Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1835 was nominated\r\nfor the Presidency by Whig State conventions in Pennsylvania, New York,\r\nOhio, and other States, but at the election on November 8, 1836, was\r\ndefeated by Martin Van Buren, receiving only 73 electoral votes to the\r\nlatter's 170. December 4, 1839, he was nominated for the Presidency by\r\nthe national Whig convention at Harrisburg, Pa., and was elected on\r\nNovember 10, 1840, receiving 234 electoral votes to Van Buren's 60. Was\r\ninaugurated March 4, 1841. Called Congress to meet in extra session on\r\nMay 31. He died on Sunday morning, April 4, 1841. His body was interred\r\nin the Congressional Cemetery at Washington, but in June, 1841, it was\r\nremoved to North Bend and placed in a tomb overlooking the Ohio River.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalled from a retirement which I had supposed was to continue for the\r\nresidue of my life to fill the chief executive office of this great and\r\nfree nation, I appear before you, fellow-citizens, to take the oaths\r\nwhich the Constitution prescribes as a necessary qualification for the\r\nperformance of its duties; and in obedience to a custom coeval with our\r\nGovernment and what I believe to be your expectations I proceed to\r\npresent to you a summary of the principles which will govern me in the\r\ndischarge of the duties which I shall be called upon to perform.\r\n\r\nIt was the remark of a Roman consul in an early period of that\r\ncelebrated Republic that a most striking contrast was observable in the\r\nconduct of candidates for offices of power and trust before and after\r\nobtaining them, they seldom carrying out in the latter case the pledges\r\nand promises made in the former. However much the world may have\r\nimproved in many respects in the lapse of upward of two thousand years\r\nsince the remark was made by the virtuous and indignant Roman, I fear\r\nthat a strict examination of the annals of some of the modern elective\r\ngovernments would develop similar instances of violated confidence.\r\n\r\nAlthough the fiat of the people has gone forth proclaiming me the Chief\r\nMagistrate of this glorious Union, nothing upon their part remaining to\r\nbe done, it may be thought that a motive may exist to keep up the\r\ndelusion under which they may be supposed to have acted in relation to\r\nmy principles and opinions; and perhaps there may be some in this\r\nassembly who have come here either prepared to condemn those I shall now\r\ndeliver, or, approving them, to doubt the sincerity with which they are\r\nnow uttered. But the lapse of a few months will confirm or dispel their\r\nfears. The outline of principles to govern and measures to be adopted by\r\nan Administration not yet begun will soon be exchanged for immutable\r\nhistory, and I shall stand either exonerated by my countrymen or classed\r\nwith the mass of those who promised that they might deceive and\r\nflattered with the intention to betray. However strong may be my present\r\npurpose to realize the expectations of a magnanimous and confiding\r\npeople, I too well understand the dangerous temptations to which I shall\r\nbe exposed from the magnitude of the power which it has been the\r\npleasure of the people to commit to my hands not to place my chief\r\nconfidence upon the aid of that Almighty Power which has hitherto\r\nprotected me and enabled me to bring to favorable issues other important\r\nbut still greatly inferior trusts heretofore confided to me by my\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe broad foundation upon which our Constitution rests being the\r\npeople--a breath of theirs having made, as a breath can unmake, change,\r\nor modify it--it can be assigned to none of the great divisions of\r\ngovernment but to that of democracy. If such is its theory, those who\r\nare called upon to administer it must recognize as its leading principle\r\nthe duty of shaping their measures so as to produce the greatest good to\r\nthe greatest number. But with these broad admissions, if we would\r\ncompare the sovereignty acknowledged to exist in the mass of our people\r\nwith the power claimed by other sovereignties, even by those which have\r\nbeen considered most purely democratic, we shall find a most essential\r\ndifference. All others lay claim to power limited only by their own\r\nwill. The majority of our citizens, on the contrary, possess a\r\nsovereignty with an amount of power precisely equal to that which has\r\nbeen granted to them by the parties to the national compact, and nothing\r\nbeyond. We admit of no government by divine right, believing that so far\r\nas power is concerned the Beneficent Creator has made no distinction\r\namongst men; that all are upon an equality, and that the only legitimate\r\nright to govern is an express grant of power from the governed. The\r\nConstitution of the United States is the instrument containing this\r\ngrant of power to the several departments composing the Government. On\r\nan examination of that instrument it will be found to contain\r\ndeclarations of power granted and of power withheld. The latter is also\r\nsusceptible of division into power which the majority had the right to\r\ngrant, but which they did not think proper to intrust to their agents,\r\nand that which they could not have granted, not being possessed by\r\nthemselves. In other words, there are certain rights possessed by each\r\nindividual American citizen which in his compact with the others he has\r\nnever surrendered. Some of them, indeed, he is unable to surrender,\r\nbeing, in the language of our system, unalienable. The boasted privilege\r\nof a Roman citizen was to him a shield only against a petty provincial\r\nruler, whilst the proud democrat of Athens would console himself under a\r\nsentence of death for a supposed violation of the national faith--which\r\nno one understood and which at times was the subject of the mockery of\r\nall--or the banishment from his home, his family, and his country with\r\nor without an alleged cause, that it was the act not of a single tyrant\r\nor hated aristocracy, but of his assembled countrymen. Far different is\r\nthe power of our sovereignty. It can interfere with no one's faith,\r\nprescribe forms of worship for no one's observance, inflict no\r\npunishment but after well-ascertained guilt, the result of investigation\r\nunder rules prescribed by the Constitution itself. These precious\r\nprivileges, and those scarcely less important of giving expression to\r\nhis thoughts and opinions, either by writing or speaking, unrestrained\r\nbut by the liability for injury to others, and that of a full\r\nparticipation in all the advantages which flow from the Government, the\r\nacknowledged property of all, the American citizen derives from no\r\ncharter granted by his fellow-man. He claims them because he is himself\r\na man, fashioned by the same Almighty hand as the rest of his species\r\nand entitled to a full share of the blessings with which He has endowed\r\nthem. Notwithstanding the limited sovereignty possessed by the people of\r\nthe United States and the restricted grant of power to the Government\r\nwhich they have adopted, enough has been given to accomplish all the\r\nobjects for which it was created. It has been found powerful in war, and\r\nhitherto justice has been administered, an intimate union effected,\r\ndomestic tranquillity preserved, and personal liberty secured to the\r\ncitizen. As was to be expected, however, from the defect of language and\r\nthe necessarily sententious manner in which the Constitution is written,\r\ndisputes have arisen as to the amount of power which it has actually\r\ngranted or was intended to grant.\r\n\r\nThis is more particularly the case in relation to that part of the\r\ninstrument which treats of the legislative branch, and not only as\r\nregards the exercise of powers claimed under a general clause giving\r\nthat body the authority to pass all laws necessary to carry into effect\r\nthe specified powers, but in relation to the latter also. It is,\r\nhowever, consolatory to reflect that _most_ of the instances of\r\nalleged departure from the letter or spirit of the Constitution have\r\nultimately received the sanction of a majority of the people. And the\r\nfact that many of our statesmen most distinguished for talent and\r\npatriotism have been at one time or other of their political career on\r\nboth sides of each of the most warmly disputed questions forces upon us\r\nthe inference that the errors, if errors there were, are attributable to\r\nthe intrinsic difficulty in many instances of ascertaining the\r\nintentions of the framers of the Constitution rather than the influence\r\nof any sinister or unpatriotic motive. But the great danger to our\r\ninstitutions does not appear to me to be in a usurpation by the\r\nGovernment of power not granted by the people, but by the accumulation\r\nin one of the departments of that which was assigned to others. Limited\r\nas are the powers which have been granted, still enough have been\r\ngranted to constitute a despotism if concentrated in one of the\r\ndepartments. This danger is greatly heightened, as it has been always\r\nobservable that men are less jealous of encroachments of one department\r\nupon another than upon their own reserved rights. When the Constitution\r\nof the United States first came from the hands of the Convention which\r\nformed it, many of the sternest republicans of the day were alarmed at\r\nthe extent of the power which had been granted to the Federal\r\nGovernment, and more particularly of that portion which had been\r\nassigned to the executive branch. There were in it features which\r\nappeared not to be in harmony with their ideas of a simple\r\nrepresentative democracy or republic, and knowing the tendency of power\r\nto increase itself, particularly when exercised by a single individual,\r\npredictions were made that at no very remote period the Government would\r\nterminate in virtual monarchy. It would not become me to say that the\r\nfears of these patriots have been already realized; but as I sincerely\r\nbelieve that the tendency of measures and of men's opinions for some\r\nyears past has been in that direction, it is, I conceive, strictly\r\nproper that I should take this occasion to repeat the assurances I have\r\nheretofore given of my determination to arrest the progress of that\r\ntendency if it really exists and restore the Government to its pristine\r\nhealth and vigor, as far as this can be effected by any legitimate\r\nexercise of the power placed in my hands.\r\n\r\nI proceed to state in as summary a manner as I can my opinion of the\r\nsources of the evils which have been so extensively complained of and\r\nthe correctives which may be applied. Some of the former are\r\nunquestionably to be found in the defects of the Constitution; others,\r\nin my judgment, are attributable to a misconstruction of some of its\r\nprovisions. Of the former is the eligibility of the same individual to a\r\nsecond term of the Presidency. The sagacious mind of Mr. Jefferson early\r\nsaw and lamented this error, and attempts have been made, hitherto\r\nwithout success, to apply the amendatory power of the States to its\r\ncorrection. As, however, one mode of correction is in the power of every\r\nPresident, and consequently in mine, it would be useless, and perhaps\r\ninvidious, to enumerate the evils of which, in the opinion of many of\r\nour fellow-citizens, this error of the sages who framed the Constitution\r\nmay have been the source and the bitter fruits which we are still to\r\ngather from it if it continues to disfigure our system. It may be\r\nobserved, however, as a general remark, that republics can commit no\r\ngreater error than to adopt or continue any feature in their systems of\r\ngovernment which may be calculated to create or increase the love of\r\npower in the bosoms of those to whom necessity obliges them to commit\r\nthe management of their affairs; and surely nothing is more likely to\r\nproduce such a state of mind than the long continuance of an office of\r\nhigh trust. Nothing can be more corrupting, nothing more destructive of\r\nall those noble feelings which belong to the character of a devoted\r\nrepublican patriot. When this corrupting passion once takes possession\r\nof the human mind, like the love of gold it becomes insatiable. It is\r\nthe never-dying worm in his bosom, grows with his growth and strengthens\r\nwith the declining years of its victim. If this is true, it is the part\r\nof wisdom for a republic to limit the service of that officer at least\r\nto whom she has intrusted the management of her foreign relations, the\r\nexecution of her laws, and the command of her armies and navies to a\r\nperiod so short as to prevent his forgetting that he is the accountable\r\nagent, not the principal; the servant, not the master. Until an\r\namendment of the Constitution can be effected public opinion may secure\r\nthe desired object. I give my aid to it by renewing the pledge\r\nheretofore given that under no circumstances will I consent to serve\r\na second term.\r\n\r\nBut if there is danger to public liberty from the acknowledged defects\r\nof the Constitution in the want of limit to the continuance of the\r\nExecutive power in the same hands, there is, I apprehend, not much less\r\nfrom a misconstruction of that instrument as it regards the powers\r\nactually given. I can not conceive that by a fair construction any or\r\neither of its provisions would be found to constitute the President a\r\npart of the legislative power. It can not be claimed from the power to\r\nrecommend, since, although enjoined as a duty upon him, it is a\r\nprivilege which he holds in common with every other citizen; and\r\nalthough there may be something more of confidence in the propriety of\r\nthe measures recommended in the one case than in the other, in the\r\nobligations of ultimate decision there can be no difference. In the\r\nlanguage of the Constitution, \"all the legislative powers\" which it\r\ngrants \"are vested in the Congress of the United States.\" It would be a\r\nsolecism in language to say that any portion of these is not included in\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, indeed, that the Constitution has given to the Executive\r\nthe power to annul the acts of the legislative body by refusing to them\r\nhis assent. So a similar power has necessarily resulted from that\r\ninstrument to the judiciary, and yet the judiciary forms no part of the\r\nLegislature. There is, it is true, this difference between these grants\r\nof power: The Executive can put his negative upon the acts of the\r\nLegislature for other cause than that of want of conformity to the\r\nConstitution, whilst the judiciary can only declare void those which\r\nviolate that instrument. But the decision of the judiciary is final in\r\nsuch a case, whereas in every instance where the veto of the Executive\r\nis applied it may be overcome by a vote of two-thirds of both Houses of\r\nCongress. The negative upon the acts of the legislative by the executive\r\nauthority, and that in the hands of one individual, would seem to be an\r\nincongruity in our system. Like some others of a similar character,\r\nhowever, it appears to be highly expedient, and if used only with the\r\nforbearance and in the spirit which was intended by its authors it may\r\nbe productive of great good and be found one of the best safeguards to\r\nthe Union. At the period of the formation of the Constitution the\r\nprinciple does not appear to have enjoyed much favor in the State\r\ngovernments. It existed but in two, and in one of these there was a\r\nplural executive. If we would search for the motives which operated upon\r\nthe purely patriotic and enlightened assembly which framed the\r\nConstitution for the adoption of a provision so apparently repugnant to\r\nthe leading democratic principle that the majority should govern, we\r\nmust reject the idea that they anticipated from it any benefit to the\r\nordinary course of legislation. They knew too well the high degree of\r\nintelligence which existed among the people and the enlightened\r\ncharacter of the State legislatures not to have the fullest confidence\r\nthat the two bodies elected by them would be worthy representatives of\r\nsuch constituents, and, of course, that they would require no aid in\r\nconceiving and maturing the measures which the circumstances of the\r\ncountry might require. And it is preposterous to suppose that a thought\r\ncould for a moment have been entertained that the President, placed at\r\nthe capital, in the center of the country, could better understand the\r\nwants and wishes of the people than their own immediate representatives,\r\nwho spend a part of every year among them, living with them, often\r\nlaboring with them, and bound to them by the triple tie of interest,\r\nduty, and affection. To assist or control Congress, then, in its\r\nordinary legislation could not, I conceive, have been the motive for\r\nconferring the veto power on the President. This argument acquires\r\nadditional force from the fact of its never having been thus used by the\r\nfirst six Presidents--and two of them were members of the Convention,\r\none presiding over its deliberations and the other bearing a larger\r\nshare in consummating the labors of that august body than any other\r\nperson. But if bills were never returned to Congress by either of the\r\nPresidents above referred to upon the ground of their being inexpedient\r\nor not as well adapted as they might be to the wants of the people, the\r\nveto was applied upon that of want of conformity to the Constitution or\r\nbecause errors had been committed from a too hasty enactment.\r\n\r\nThere is another ground for the adoption of the veto principle, which\r\nhad probably more influence in recommending it to the Convention than\r\nany other. I refer to the security which it gives to the just and\r\nequitable action of the Legislature upon all parts of the Union. It\r\ncould not but have occurred to the Convention that in a country so\r\nextensive, embracing so great a variety of soil and climate, and\r\nconsequently of products, and which from the same causes must ever\r\nexhibit a great difference in the amount of the population of its\r\nvarious sections, calling for a great diversity in the employments of\r\nthe people, that the legislation of the majority might not always justly\r\nregard the rights and interests of the minority, and that acts of this\r\ncharacter might be passed under an express grant by the words of the\r\nConstitution, and therefore not within the competency of the judiciary\r\nto declare void; that however enlightened and patriotic they might\r\nsuppose from past experience the members of Congress might be, and\r\nhowever largely partaking, in the general, of the liberal feelings of\r\nthe people, it was impossible to expect that bodies so constituted\r\nshould not sometimes be controlled by local interests and sectional\r\nfeelings. It was proper, therefore, to provide some umpire from whose\r\nsituation and mode of appointment more independence and freedom from\r\nsuch influences might be expected. Such a one was afforded by the\r\nexecutive department constituted by the Constitution. A person elected\r\nto that high office, having his constituents in every section, State,\r\nand subdivision of the Union, must consider himself bound by the most\r\nsolemn sanctions to guard, protect, and defend the rights of all and of\r\nevery portion, great or small, from the injustice and oppression of the\r\nrest. I consider the veto power, therefore, given by the Constitution to\r\nthe Executive of the United States solely as a conservative power, to be\r\nused only, first, to protect the Constitution from violation; Secondly,\r\nthe people from the effects of hasty legislation where their will has\r\nbeen probably disregarded or not well understood, and, thirdly, to\r\nprevent the effects of combinations violative of the rights of\r\nminorities. In reference to the second of these objects I may observe\r\nthat I consider it the right and privilege of the people to decide\r\ndisputed points of the Constitution arising from the general grant of\r\npower to Congress to carry into effect the powers expressly given; and I\r\nbelieve with Mr. Madison that \"repeated recognitions under varied\r\ncircumstances in acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial\r\nbranches of the Government, accompanied by indications in different\r\nmodes of the concurrence of the general will of the nation,\" as\r\naffording to the President sufficient authority for his considering such\r\ndisputed points as settled.\r\n\r\nUpward of half a century has elapsed since the adoption of the present\r\nform of government. It would be an object more highly desirable than the\r\ngratification of the curiosity of speculative statesmen if its precise\r\nsituation could be ascertained, a fair exhibit made of the operations of\r\neach of its departments, of the powers which they respectively claim and\r\nexercise, of the collisions which have occurred between them or between\r\nthe whole Government and those of the States or either of them. We could\r\nthen compare our actual condition after fifty years' trial of our system\r\nwith what it was in the commencement of its operations and ascertain\r\nwhether the predictions of the patriots who opposed its adoption or the\r\nconfident hopes of its advocates have been best realized. The great\r\ndread of the former seems to have been that the reserved powers of the\r\nStates would be absorbed by those of the Federal Government and a\r\nconsolidated power established, leaving to the States the shadow only of\r\nthat independent action for which they had so zealously contended and on\r\nthe preservation of which they relied as the last hope of liberty.\r\nWithout denying that the result to which they looked with so much\r\napprehension is in the way of being realized, it is obvious that they\r\ndid not clearly see the mode of its accomplishment. The General\r\nGovernment has seized upon none of the reserved rights of the States. As\r\nfar as any open warfare may have gone, the State authorities have amply\r\nmaintained their rights. To a casual observer our system presents no\r\nappearance of discord between the different members which compose it.\r\nEven the addition of many new ones has produced no jarring. They move in\r\ntheir respective orbits in perfect harmony with the central head and\r\nwith each other. But there is still an undercurrent at work by which, if\r\nnot seasonably checked, the worst apprehensions of our anti-federal\r\npatriots will be realized, and not only will the State authorities be\r\novershadowed by the great increase of power in the executive department\r\nof the General Government, but the character of that Government, if not\r\nits designation, be essentially and radically changed. This state of\r\nthings has been in part effected by causes inherent in the Constitution\r\nand in part by the never-failing tendency of political power to increase\r\nitself. By making the President the sole distributer of all the\r\npatronage of the Government the framers of the Constitution do not\r\nappear to have anticipated at how short a period it would become a\r\nformidable instrument to control the free operations of the State\r\ngovernments. Of trifling importance at first, it had early in Mr.\r\nJefferson's Administration become so powerful as to create great alarm\r\nin the mind of that patriot from the potent influence it might exert in\r\ncontrolling the freedom of the elective franchise. If such could have\r\nthen been the effects of its influence, how much greater must be the\r\ndanger at this time, quadrupled in amount as it certainly is and more\r\ncompletely under the control of the Executive will than their\r\nconstruction of their powers allowed or the forbearing characters of all\r\nthe early Presidents permitted them to make. But it is not by the extent\r\nof its patronage alone that the executive department has become\r\ndangerous, but by the use which it appears may be made of the appointing\r\npower to bring under its control the whole revenues of the country. The\r\nConstitution has declared it to be the duty of the President to see that\r\nthe laws are executed, and it makes him the Commander in Chief of the\r\nArmies and Navy of the United States. If the opinion of the most\r\napproved writers upon that species of mixed government which in modern\r\nEurope is termed _monarchy_ in contradistinction to _despotism_\r\nis correct, there was wanting no other addition to the powers of our\r\nChief Magistrate to stamp a monarchical character on our Government\r\nbut the control of the public finances; and to me it appears strange\r\nindeed that anyone should doubt that the entire control which the\r\nPresident possesses over the officers who have the custody of the\r\npublic money, by the power of removal with or without cause, does, for\r\nall mischievous purposes at least, virtually subject the treasure also\r\nto his disposal. The first Roman Emperor, in his attempt to seize the\r\nsacred treasure, silenced the opposition of the officer to whose charge\r\nit had been committed by a significant allusion to his sword. By a\r\nselection of political instruments for the care of the public money a\r\nreference to their commissions by a President would be quite as\r\neffectual an argument as that of Caesar to the Roman knight. I am not\r\ninsensible of the great difficulty that exists in drawing a proper plan\r\nfor the safe-keeping and disbursement of the public revenues, and I know\r\nthe importance which has been attached by men of great abilities and\r\npatriotism to the divorce, as it is called, of the Treasury from the\r\nbanking institutions. It is not the divorce which is complained of, but\r\nthe unhallowed union of the Treasury with the executive department,\r\nwhich has created such extensive alarm. To this danger to our republican\r\ninstitutions and that created by the influence given to the Executive\r\nthrough the instrumentality of the Federal officers I propose to apply\r\nall the remedies which may be at my command. It was certainly a great\r\nerror in the framers of the Constitution not to have made the officer at\r\nthe head of the Treasury Department entirely independent of the\r\nExecutive. He should at least have been removable only upon the demand\r\nof the popular branch of the Legislature. I have determined never to\r\nremove a Secretary of the Treasury without communicating all the\r\ncircumstances attending such removal to both Houses of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Executive in controlling the freedom of the\r\nelective franchise through the medium of the public officers can be\r\neffectually checked by renewing the prohibition published by Mr.\r\nJefferson forbidding their interference in elections further than giving\r\ntheir own votes, and their own independence secured by an assurance of\r\nperfect immunity in exercising this sacred privilege of freemen under\r\nthe dictates of their own unbiased judgments. Never with my consent\r\nshall an officer of the people, compensated for his services out of\r\ntheir pockets, become the pliant instrument of Executive will.\r\n\r\nThere is no part of the means placed in the hands of the Executive which\r\nmight be used with greater effect for unhallowed purposes than the\r\ncontrol of the public press. The maxim which our ancestors derived from\r\nthe mother country that \"the freedom of the press is the great bulwark\r\nof civil and religious liberty\" is one of the most precious legacies\r\nwhich they have left us. We have learned, too, from our own as well as\r\nthe experience of other countries, that golden shackles, by whomsoever\r\nor by whatever pretense imposed, are as fatal to it as the iron bonds of\r\ndespotism. The presses in the necessary employment of the Government\r\nshould never be used \"to clear the guilty or to varnish crime.\" A decent\r\nand manly examination of the acts of the Government should be not only\r\ntolerated, but encouraged.\r\n\r\nUpon another occasion I have given my opinion at some length upon the\r\nimpropriety of Executive interference in the legislation of\r\nCongress--that the article in the Constitution making it the duty of the\r\nPresident to communicate information and authorizing him to recommend\r\nmeasures was not intended to make him the source in legislation, and, in\r\nparticular, that he should never be looked to for schemes of finance. It\r\nwould be very strange, indeed, that the Constitution should have\r\nstrictly forbidden one branch of the Legislature from interfering in the\r\norigination of such bills and that it should be considered proper that\r\nan altogether different department of the Government should be permitted\r\nto do so. Some of our best political maxims and opinions have been drawn\r\nfrom our parent isle. There are others, however, which can not be\r\nintroduced in our system without singular incongruity and the production\r\nof much mischief, and this I conceive to be one. No matter in which of\r\nthe houses of Parliament a bill may originate nor by whom introduced--a\r\nminister or a member of the opposition--by the fiction of law, or rather\r\nof constitutional principle, the sovereign is supposed to have prepared\r\nit agreeably to his will and then submitted it to Parliament for their\r\nadvice and consent. Now the very reverse is the case here, not only with\r\nregard to the principle, but the forms prescribed by the Constitution.\r\nThe principle certainly assigns to the only body constituted by the\r\nConstitution (the legislative body) the power to make laws, and the\r\nforms even direct that the enactment should be ascribed to them. The\r\nSenate, in relation to revenue bills, have the right to propose\r\namendments, and so has the Executive by the power given him to return\r\nthem to the House of Representatives with his objections. It is in his\r\npower also to propose amendments in the existing revenue laws, suggested\r\nby his observations upon their defective or injurious operation. But the\r\ndelicate duty of devising schemes of revenue should be left where the\r\nConstitution has placed it--with the immediate representatives of the\r\npeople. For similar reasons the mode of keeping the public treasure\r\nshould be prescribed by them, and the further removed it may be from the\r\ncontrol of the Executive the more wholesome the arrangement and the more\r\nin accordance with republican principle.\r\n\r\nConnected with this subject is the character of the currency. The idea\r\nof making it exclusively metallic, however well intended, appears to me\r\nto be fraught with more fatal consequences than any other scheme having\r\nno relation to the personal rights of the citizens that has ever been\r\ndevised. If any single scheme could produce the effect of arresting at\r\nonce that mutation of condition by which thousands of our most indigent\r\nfellow-citizens by their industry and enterprise are raised to the\r\npossession of wealth, that is the one. If there is one measure better\r\ncalculated than another to produce that state of things so much\r\ndeprecated by all true republicans, by which the rich are daily adding\r\nto their hoards and the poor sinking deeper into penury, it is an\r\nexclusive metallic currency. Or if there is a process by which the\r\ncharacter of the country for generosity and nobleness of feeling may be\r\ndestroyed by the great increase and necessary toleration of usury, it is\r\nan exclusive metallic currency.\r\n\r\nAmongst the other duties of a delicate character which the President is\r\ncalled upon to perform is the supervision of the government of the\r\nTerritories of the United States. Those of them which are destined to\r\nbecome members of our great political family are compensated by their\r\nrapid progress from infancy to manhood for the partial and temporary\r\ndeprivation of their political rights. It is in this District only where\r\nAmerican citizens are to be found who under a settled policy are\r\ndeprived of many important political privileges without any inspiring\r\nhope as to the future. Their only consolation under circumstances of\r\nsuch deprivation is that of the devoted exterior guards of a camp--that\r\ntheir sufferings secure tranquillity and safety within. Are there any of\r\ntheir countrymen who would subject them to greater sacrifices, to any\r\nother humiliations than those essentially necessary to the security of\r\nthe object for which they were thus separated from their\r\nfellow-citizens? Are their rights alone not to be guaranteed by the\r\napplication of those great principles upon which all our constitutions\r\nare founded? We are told by the greatest of British orators and\r\nstatesmen that at the commencement of the War of the Revolution the most\r\nstupid men in England spoke of \"their American subjects.\" Are there,\r\nindeed, citizens of any of our States who have dreamed _of their\r\nsubjects_ in the District of Columbia? Such dreams can never be\r\nrealized by any agency of mine. The people of the District of Columbia\r\nare not the subjects of the people of the States, but free American\r\ncitizens. Being in the latter condition when the Constitution was\r\nformed, no words used in that instrument could have been intended to\r\ndeprive them of that character. If there is anything in the great\r\nprinciple of unalienable rights so emphatically insisted upon in our\r\nDeclaration of Independence, they could neither make nor the United\r\nStates accept a surrender of their liberties and become the\r\n_subjects_--in other words, the slaves--of their former\r\nfellow-citizens. If this be true--and it will scarcely be denied by\r\nanyone who has a correct idea of his own rights as an American\r\ncitizen--the grant to Congress of exclusive jurisdiction in the District\r\nof Columbia can be interpreted, so far as respects the aggregate people\r\nof the United States, as meaning nothing more than to allow to Congress\r\nthe controlling power necessary to afford a free and safe exercise of\r\nthe functions assigned to the General Government by the Constitution. In\r\nall other respects the legislation of Congress should be adapted to\r\ntheir peculiar position and wants and be conformable with their\r\ndeliberate opinions of their own interests.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the necessity of keeping the respective departments of\r\nthe Government, as well as all the other authorities of our country,\r\nwithin their appropriate orbits. This is a matter of difficulty, in some\r\ncases, as the powers which they respectively claim are often not defined\r\nby any distinct lines. Mischievous, however, in their tendencies as\r\ncollisions of this kind may be, those which arise between the respective\r\ncommunities which for certain purposes compose one nation are much more\r\nso, for no such nation can long exist without the careful culture of\r\nthose feelings of confidence and affection which are the effective bonds\r\nto union between free and confederated states. Strong as is the tie of\r\ninterest, it has been often found ineffectual. Men blinded by their\r\npassions have been known to adopt measures for their country in direct\r\nopposition to all the suggestions of policy. The alternative, then, is\r\nto destroy or keep down a bad passion by creating and fostering a good\r\none, and this seems to be the corner stone upon which our American\r\npolitical architects have reared the fabric of our Government. The\r\ncement which was to bind it and perpetuate its existence was the\r\naffectionate attachment between all its members, To insure the\r\ncontinuance of this feeling, produced at first by a community of\r\ndangers, of sufferings, and of interests, the advantages of each were\r\nmade accessible to all. No participation in any good possessed by any\r\nmember of our extensive Confederacy, except in domestic government, was\r\nwithheld from the citizen of any other member. By a process attended\r\nwith no difficulty, no delay, no expense but that of removal, the\r\ncitizen of one might become the citizen of any other, and successively\r\nof the whole. The lines, too, separating powers to be exercised by the\r\ncitizens of one State from those of another seem to be so distinctly\r\ndrawn as to leave no room for misunderstanding. The citizens of each\r\nState unite in their persons all the privileges which that character\r\nconfers and all that they may claim as citizens of the United States,\r\nbut in no case can the same persons at the same time act as the citizen\r\nof two separate States, and _he is therefore positively precluded from\r\nany interference with the reserved powers of any State but that of which\r\nhe is for the time being a citizen_. He may, indeed, offer to the\r\ncitizens of other States his advice as to their management, and the form\r\nin which it is tendered is left to his own discretion and sense of\r\npropriety. It may be observed, however, that organized associations of\r\ncitizens requiring compliance with their wishes too much resemble the\r\n_recommendations_ of Athens to her allies, supported by an armed\r\nand powerful fleet. It was, indeed, to the ambition of the leading\r\nStates of Greece to control the domestic concerns of the others that the\r\ndestruction of that celebrated Confederacy, and subsequently of all its\r\nmembers, is mainly to be attributed, and it is owing to the absence of\r\nthat spirit that the Helvetic Confederacy has for so many years been\r\npreserved. Never has there been seen in the institutions of the separate\r\nmembers of any confederacy more elements of discord. In the principles\r\nand forms of government and religion, as well as in the circumstances of\r\nthe several Cantons, so marked a discrepancy was observable as to\r\npromise anything but harmony in their intercourse or permanency in their\r\nalliance, and yet for ages neither has been interrupted. Content with\r\nthe positive benefits which their union produced, with the independence\r\nand safety from foreign aggression which it secured, these sagacious\r\npeople respected the institutions of each other, however repugnant to\r\ntheir own principles and prejudices.\r\n\r\nOur Confederacy, fellow-citizens, can only be preserved by the same\r\nforbearance. Our citizens must be content with the exercise of the\r\npowers with which the Constitution clothes them. The attempt of those of\r\none State to control the domestic institutions of another can only\r\nresult in feelings of distrust and jealousy, the certain harbingers of\r\ndisunion, violence, and civil war, and the ultimate destruction of our\r\nfree institutions. Our Confederacy is perfectly illustrated by the terms\r\nand principles governing a common copartnership. There is a fund of\r\npower to be exercised under the direction of the joint councils of the\r\nallied members, but that which has been reserved by the individual\r\nmembers is intangible by the common Government or the individual members\r\ncomposing it. To attempt it finds no support in the principles of our\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nIt should be our constant and earnest endeavor mutually to cultivate a\r\nspirit of concord and harmony among the various parts of our\r\nConfederacy. Experience has abundantly taught us that the agitation by\r\ncitizens of one part of the Union of a subject not confided to the\r\nGeneral Government, but exclusively under the guardianship of the local\r\nauthorities, is productive of no other consequences than bitterness,\r\nalienation, discord, and injury to the very cause which is intended to\r\nbe advanced. Of all the great interests which appertain to our country,\r\nthat of union--cordial, confiding, fraternal union--is by far the most\r\nimportant, since it is the only true and sure guaranty of all others.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the embarrassed state of business and the currency,\r\nsome of the States may meet with difficulty in their financial concerns.\r\nHowever deeply we may regret anything imprudent or excessive in the\r\nengagements into which States have entered for purposes of their own, it\r\ndoes not become us to disparage the State governments, nor to discourage\r\nthem from making proper efforts for their own relief. On the contrary,\r\nit is our duty to encourage them to the extent of our constitutional\r\nauthority to apply their best means and cheerfully to make all necessary\r\nsacrifices and submit to all necessary burdens to fulfill their\r\nengagements and maintain their credit, for the character and credit of\r\nthe several States form a part of the character and credit of the whole\r\ncountry. The resources of the country are abundant, the enterprise and\r\nactivity of our people proverbial, and we may well hope that wise\r\nlegislation and prudent administration by the respective governments,\r\neach acting within its own sphere, will restore former prosperity.\r\n\r\nUnpleasant and even dangerous as collisions may sometimes be between the\r\nconstituted authorities of the citizens of our country in relation to\r\nthe lines which separate their respective jurisdictions, the results can\r\nbe of no vital injury to our institutions if that ardent patriotism,\r\nthat devoted attachment to liberty, that spirit of moderation and\r\nforbearance for which our countrymen were once distinguished, continue\r\nto be cherished. If this continues to be the ruling passion of our\r\nsouls, the weaker feeling of the mistaken enthusiast will be corrected,\r\nthe Utopian dreams of the scheming politician dissipated, and the\r\ncomplicated intrigues of the demagogue rendered harmless. The spirit of\r\nliberty is the sovereign balm for every injury which our institutions\r\nmay receive. On the contrary, no care that can be used in the\r\nconstruction of our Government, no division of powers, no distribution\r\nof checks in its several departments, will prove effectual to keep us a\r\nfree people if this spirit is suffered to decay; and decay it will\r\nwithout constant nurture. To the neglect of this duty the best\r\nhistorians agree in attributing the ruin of all the republics with whose\r\nexistence and fall their writings have made us acquainted. The same\r\ncauses will ever produce the same effects, and as long as the love of\r\npower is a dominant passion of the human bosom, and as long as the\r\nunderstandings of men can be warped and their affections changed by\r\noperations upon their passions and prejudices, so long will the\r\nliberties of a people depend on their own constant attention to its\r\npreservation. The danger to all well-established free governments arises\r\nfrom the unwillingness of the people to believe in its existence or from\r\nthe influence of designing men diverting their attention from the\r\nquarter whence it approaches to a source from which it can never come.\r\nThis is the old trick of those who would usurp the government of their\r\ncountry. In the name of democracy they speak, warning the people against\r\nthe influence of wealth and the danger of aristocracy. History, ancient\r\nand modern, is full of such examples. Caesar became the master of the\r\nRoman people and the senate under the pretense of supporting the\r\ndemocratic claims of the former against the aristocracy of the latter;\r\nCromwell, in the character of protector of the liberties of the people,\r\nbecame the dictator of England, and Bolivar possessed himself of\r\nunlimited power with the title of his country's liberator. There is, on\r\nthe contrary, no instance on record of an extensive and well-established\r\nrepublic being changed into an aristocracy. The tendencies of all such\r\ngovernments in their decline is to monarchy, and the antagonist\r\nprinciple to liberty there is the spirit of faction--a spirit which\r\nassumes the character and in times of great excitement imposes itself\r\nupon the people as the genuine spirit of freedom, and, like the false\r\nChrists whose coming was foretold by the Savior, seeks to, and were it\r\npossible would, impose upon the true and most faithful disciples of\r\nliberty. It is in periods like this that it behooves the people to be\r\nmost watchful of those to whom they have intrusted power. And although\r\nthere is at times much difficulty in distinguishing the false from the\r\ntrue spirit, a calm and dispassionate investigation will detect the\r\ncounterfeit, as well by the character of its operations as the results\r\nthat are produced. The true spirit of liberty, although devoted,\r\npersevering, bold, and uncompromising in principle, that secured is mild\r\nand tolerant and scrupulous as to the means it employs, whilst the\r\nspirit of party, assuming to be that of liberty, is harsh, vindictive,\r\nand intolerant, and totally reckless as to the character of the allies\r\nwhich it brings to the aid of its cause. When the genuine spirit of\r\nliberty animates the body of a people to a thorough examination of their\r\naffairs, it leads to the excision of every excrescence which may have\r\nfastened itself upon any of the departments of the government, and\r\nrestores the system to its pristine health and beauty. But the reign of\r\nan intolerant spirit of party amongst a free people seldom fails to\r\nresult in a dangerous accession to the executive power introduced and\r\nestablished amidst unusual professions of devotion to democracy.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks relate almost exclusively to matters connected\r\nwith our domestic concerns. It may be proper, however, that I should\r\ngive some indications to my fellow-citizens of my proposed course of\r\nconduct in the management of our foreign relations. I assure them,\r\ntherefore, that it is my intention to use every means in my power to\r\npreserve the friendly intercourse which now so happily subsists with\r\nevery foreign nation, and that although, of course, not well informed as\r\nto the state of pending negotiations with any of them, I see in the\r\npersonal characters of the sovereigns, as well as in the mutual\r\ninterests of our own and of the governments with which our relations are\r\nmost intimate, a pleasing guaranty that the harmony so important to the\r\ninterests of their subjects as well as of our citizens will not be\r\ninterrupted by the advancement of any claim or pretension upon their\r\npart to which our honor would not permit us to yield. Long the defender\r\nof my country's rights in the field, I trust that my fellow-citizens\r\nwill not see in my earnest desire to preserve peace with foreign powers\r\nany indication that their rights will ever be sacrificed or the honor of\r\nthe nation tarnished by any admission on the part of their Chief\r\nMagistrate unworthy of their former glory. In our intercourse with our\r\naboriginal neighbors the same liberality and justice which marked the\r\ncourse prescribed to me by two of my illustrious predecessors when\r\nacting under their direction in the discharge of the duties of\r\nsuperintendent and commissioner shall be strictly observed. I can\r\nconceive of no more sublime spectacle, none more likely to propitiate an\r\nimpartial and common Creator, than a rigid adherence to the principles\r\nof justice on the part of a powerful nation in its transactions with a\r\nweaker and uncivilized people whom circumstances have placed at its\r\ndisposal.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding, fellow-citizens, I must say something to you on the\r\nsubject of the parties at this time existing in our country. To me it\r\nappears perfectly clear that the interest of that country requires that\r\nthe violence of the spirit by which those parties are at this time\r\ngoverned must be greatly mitigated, if not entirely extinguished, or\r\nconsequences will ensue which are appalling to be thought of.\r\n\r\nIf parties in a republic are necessary to secure a degree of vigilance\r\nsufficient to keep the public functionaries within the bounds of law and\r\nduty, at that point their usefulness ends. Beyond that they become\r\ndestructive of public virtue, the parent of a spirit antagonist to that\r\nof liberty, and eventually its inevitable conqueror. We have examples of\r\nrepublics where the love of country and of liberty at one time were the\r\ndominant passions of the whole mass of citizens, and yet, with the\r\ncontinuance of the name and forms of free government, not a vestige of\r\nthese qualities remaining in the bosoms of any one of its citizens. It\r\nwas the beautiful remark of a distinguished English writer that \"in the\r\nRoman senate Octavius had a party and Antony a party, but the\r\nCommonwealth had none.\" Yet the senate continued to meet in the temple\r\nof liberty to talk of the sacredness and beauty of the Commonwealth and\r\ngaze at the statues of the elder Brutus and of the Curtii and Decii, and\r\nthe people assembled in the forum, not, as in the days of Camillus and\r\nthe Scipios, to cast their free votes for annual magistrates or pass\r\nupon the acts of the senate, but to receive from the hands of the\r\nleaders of the respective parties their share of the spoils and to shout\r\nfor one or the other, as those collected in Gaul or Egypt and the lesser\r\nAsia would furnish the larger dividend. The spirit of liberty had fled,\r\nand, avoiding the abodes of civilized man, had sought protection in the\r\nwilds of Scythia or Scandinavia; and so under the operation of the same\r\ncauses and influences it will fly from our Capitol and our forums. A\r\ncalamity so awful, not only to our country, but to the world, must be\r\ndeprecated by every patriot and every tendency to a state of things\r\nlikely to produce it immediately checked. Such a tendency has\r\nexisted--does exist. Always the friend of my countrymen, never their\r\nflatterer, it becomes my duty to say to them from this high place to\r\nwhich their partiality has exalted me that there exists in the land a\r\nspirit hostile to their best interests--hostile to liberty itself. It is\r\na spirit contracted in its views, selfish in its objects. It looks to\r\nthe aggrandizement of a few even to the destruction of the interests of\r\nthe whole. The entire remedy is with the people. Something, however, may\r\nbe effected by the means which they have placed in my hands. It is union\r\nthat we want, not of a party for the sake of that party, but a union of\r\nthe whole country for the sake of the whole country, for the defense of\r\nits interests and its honor against foreign aggression, for the defense\r\nof those principles for which our ancestors so gloriously contended. As\r\nfar as it depends upon me it shall be accomplished. All the influence\r\nthat I possess shall be exerted to prevent the formation at least of an\r\nExecutive party in the halls of the legislative body. I wish for the\r\nsupport of no member of that body to any measure of mine that does not\r\nsatisfy his judgment and his sense of duty to those from whom he holds\r\nhis appointment, nor any confidence in advance from the people but that\r\nasked for by Mr. Jefferson, \"to give firmness and effect to the legal\r\nadministration of their affairs.\"\r\n\r\nI deem the present occasion sufficiently important and solemn to justify\r\nme in expressing to my fellow-citizens a profound reverence for the\r\nChristian religion and a thorough conviction that sound morals,\r\nreligious liberty, and a just sense of religious responsibility are\r\nessentially connected with all true and lasting happiness; and to that\r\ngood Being who has blessed us by the gifts of civil and religious\r\nfreedom, who watched over and prospered the labors of our fathers and\r\nhas hitherto preserved to us institutions far exceeding in excellence\r\nthose of any other people, let us unite in fervently commending every\r\ninterest of our beloved country in all future time.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, being fully invested with that high office to which the\r\npartiality of my countrymen has called me, I now take an affectionate\r\nleave of you.

His long and faithful services in\r\nmany subordinate but important stations, his recent elevation to the\r\nhighest in honor and power, and the brief term allotted to him in the\r\nenjoyment of it are circumstances of themselves which must awaken the\r\nliveliest sympathy in every bosom. But these are personal\r\nconsiderations; the dispensation is heaviest and most afflicting on\r\npublic grounds. This great calamity has befallen the country at a period\r\nof general anxiety for its present, and some apprehension for its\r\nfuture, condition--at a time when it is most desirable that all its high\r\noffices should be filled and all its high trusts administered in\r\nharmony, wisdom, and vigor. The generosity of character of the deceased,\r\nthe conspicuous honesty of his principles and purposes, together with\r\nthe skill and firmness with which he maintained them in all situations,\r\nhad won for him the affection and confidence of his countrymen; but at\r\nthe moment when by their voice he was raised to a station in the\r\ndischarge of the powers and duties of which the most beneficent results\r\nmight justly have been anticipated from his great experience, his sound\r\njudgment, the high estimation in which he was held by the people, and\r\nhis unquestioned devotion to the Constitution and to the Union, it has\r\npleased an all-wise but mysterious Providence to remove him suddenly\r\nfrom that and every other earthly employment.\r\n\r\nWhile the officers and soldiers of the Army share in the general grief\r\nwhich these considerations so naturally and irresistibly inspire, they\r\nwill doubtless be penetrated with increased sensibility and feel a\r\ndeeper concern in testifying in the manner appropriate to them the full\r\nmeasure of a nation's gratitude for the eminent services of the departed\r\npatriot and in rendering just and adequate honors to his memory because\r\nhe was himself a soldier, and an approved one, receiving his earliest\r\nlessons in a camp, and, when in riper years called to the command of\r\narmies, illustrating the profession of arms by his personal qualities\r\nand contributing largely by his successes to the stock of his country's\r\nglory.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the suddenness of the emergency has made it\r\nnecessary to announce this sad event in the absence of the\r\nVice-President from the seat of Government; but the greatest confidence\r\nis felt that he will cordially approve the sentiments expressed, and\r\nthat he will in due time give directions for such further marks of\r\nrespect not prescribed by the existing regulations of the Army as may be\r\ndemanded by the occasion.\r\n\r\nJOHN BELL, _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDERS, No. 20.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,\r\n  ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n    _Washington, April 7, 1841_.\r\n\r\nThe death of the President of the United States having been officially\r\nannounced from the War Department, the Major-General Commanding in Chief\r\ncommunicates to the Army the melancholy intelligence with feelings of\r\nthe most profound sorrow. The long, arduous, and faithful military\r\nservices in which President Harrison has been engaged since the first\r\nsettlement of the Western country, from the rank of a subaltern to that\r\nof a commander in chief, are too well known to require a recital of them\r\nhere. It is sufficient to point to the fields of Tippecanoe, the banks\r\nof the Miami, and the Thames, in Upper Canada, to recall to many of the\r\nsoldiers of the present Army the glorious results of some of his\r\nachievements against the foes of his country, both savage and civilized.\r\n\r\nThe Army has on former occasions been called upon to mourn the loss of\r\ndistinguished patriots who have occupied the Presidential chair, but\r\nthis is the first time since the adoption of the Constitution it has to\r\nlament the demise of a President while in the actual exercise of the\r\nhigh functions of the Chief Magistracy of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Army, in common with their fellow-citizens of all\r\nclasses, deeply deplore this national bereavement; but although they\r\nhave lost a friend ever ready to protect their interests, his bright\r\nexample in the paths of honor and glory still remains for their\r\nemulation.\r\n\r\nThe funeral honors directed to be paid by the troops in paragraph 523 of\r\nthe General Regulations will be duly observed, and the troops at the\r\nseveral stations will be paraded at 10 o'clock a.m., when this order\r\nwill be read, after which all labors for the day will cease; the\r\nnational flag will be displayed at half-staff; at dawn of day thirteen\r\nguns will be fired, besides the half-hour guns as directed by the\r\nRegulations, and at the close of the day a national salute. The\r\nstandards, guidons, and colors of the several regiments will be put in\r\nmourning for the period of six months, and the officers will wear the\r\nusual badge of mourning on the left arm above the elbow and on the hilt\r\nof the sword for the same period.\r\n\r\nBy order of Alexander Macomb, Major-General Commanding in Chief:\r\n  R. JONES, _Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNOUNCEMENT TO THE NAVY.\r\n\r\n[From official records in the Navy Department.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDER.\r\n\r\nNAVY DEPARTMENT, _April 5, 1841_.\r\n\r\nThe Department announces to the officers of the Navy and Marine Corps\r\nthe death of William Henry Harrison, late President of the United\r\nStates, which occurred at the Executive Mansion, in the city of\r\nWashington, on the morning of the 4th instant, and directs that, uniting\r\nwith their fellow-citizens in the manifestations of their respect for\r\nthe exalted character and eminent public services of the illustrious\r\ndeceased, and of their sense of the bereavement the country has\r\nsustained by this afflicting dispensation of Providence, they wear the\r\nusual badge of mourning for six months.\r\n\r\nThe Department further directs that funeral honors be paid him at each\r\nof the navy-yards and on board each of the public vessels in commission\r\nby firing twenty-six minute guns, commencing at 12 o'clock m., on the\r\nday after the receipt of this order, and by wearing their flags at\r\nhalf-mast for one week.\r\n\r\n  J.D.

MILDER,\r\n  _Attending Physician_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, March 27, 1841, President Harrison, after several days'\r\nprevious indisposition, was seized with a chill and other symptoms of\r\nfever. The next day pneumonia, with congestion of the liver and\r\nderangement of the stomach and bowels, was ascertained to exist. The age\r\nand debility of the patient, with the immediate prostration, forbade a\r\nresort to general blood letting. Topical depletion, blistering, and\r\nappropriate internal remedies subdued in a great measure the disease of\r\nthe lungs and liver, but the stomach and intestines did not regain a\r\nhealthy condition. Finally, on the 3d of April, at 3 o'clock p. m.,\r\nprofuse diarrhea came on, under which he sank at thirty minutes to 1\r\no'clock on the morning of the 4th.\r\n\r\nThe last words uttered by the President, as heard by Dr. Worthington,\r\nwere these: \"Sir, I wish you to understand the true principles of the\r\nGovernment. I wish them carried out. I ask nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nTHO. MILLER, M.D.,\r\n  _Attending Physician_.\r\nFRED. MAY, M.D.,\r\nN.W. WORTHINGTON, M.D.,\r\nJ.C.

CRANCH.\r\nAPRIL 6, 1841.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nTO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nA RECOMMENDATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 13, 1841_.\r\n\r\nWhen a Christian people feel themselves to be overtaken by a great\r\npublic calamity, it becomes them to humble themselves under the\r\ndispensation of Divine Providence, to recognize His righteous government\r\nover the children of men, to acknowledge His goodness in time past, as\r\nwell as their own unworthiness, and to supplicate His merciful\r\nprotection for the future.\r\n\r\nThe death of William Henry Harrison, late President of the United\r\nStates, so soon after his elevation to that high office, is a\r\nbereavement peculiarly calculated to be regarded as a heavy affliction\r\nand to impress all minds with a sense of the uncertainty of human things\r\nand of the dependence of nations, as well as individuals, upon our\r\nHeavenly Parent.\r\n\r\nI have thought, therefore, that I should be acting in conformity with\r\nthe general expectation and feelings of the community in recommending,\r\nas I now do, to the people of the United States of every religious\r\ndenomination that, according to their several modes and forms of\r\nworship, they observe a day of fasting and prayer by such religious\r\nservices as may be suitable on the occasion; and I recommend Friday, the\r\n14th day of May next, for that purpose, to the end that on that day we\r\nmay all with one accord join in humble and reverential approach to Him\r\nin whose hands we are, invoking Him to inspire us with a proper spirit\r\nand temper of heart and mind under these frowns of His providence and\r\nstill to bestow His gracious benedictions upon our Government and our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[For \"A resolution manifesting the sensibility of Congress upon\r\nthe event of the death of William Henry Harrison, late President of\r\nthe United States,\" see p. 55.]",
