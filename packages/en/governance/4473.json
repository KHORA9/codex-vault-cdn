NESTA'S ENGAGEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTREATS OF NATURE AND CIRCUMSTANCE AND THE DISSENSION BETWEEN THEM AND OF\r\nA SATIRIST'S MALIGNITY IN THE DIRECTION OF HIS COUNTRY\r\n\r\nThere is at times in the hearts of all men of active life a vivid wild\r\nmoment or two of dramatic dialogue between the veteran antagonists,\r\nNature and Circumstance, when they, whose business it should be to be\r\njoyfully one, furiously split; and the Dame is up with her shrillest\r\nquerulousness to inquire of her offspring, for the distinct original\r\nmotive of his conduct.  Why did he bring her to such a pass!  And what is\r\nthe gain?  If he be not an alienated issue of the great Mother, he will\r\nstrongly incline to her view, that he put himself into harness to join\r\nwith a machine going the dead contrary way of her welfare; and thereby\r\nwrote himself donkey, for his present reading.  Soldiers, heroes, even\r\nthe braided, even the wearers of the gay cock's feathers, who get the\r\nhonours and the pocket-pieces, know the moment of her electrical\r\neloquence.  They have no answer for her, save an index at the machine\r\npushing them on yet farther under the enemy's line of fire, where they\r\npluck the golden wreath or the livid, and in either case listen no more.\r\nThey glorify her topping wisdom while on the march to confound it.  She\r\nis wise in her way.  But, it is asked by the disputant, If we had\r\nfollowed her exclusively, how far should we have travelled from our\r\nstarting-point?  We of the world and its prizes and duties must do her an\r\ninjury to make her tongue musical to us, and her argument worthy of\r\nattention.  So it seems.  How to keep the proper balance between those\r\ntwo testy old wranglers, that rarely pull the right way together, is as\r\nmuch the task for men in the grip of the world, as for the wanton\r\nyouthful fry under dominion of their instincts; and probably, when it is\r\ndone, man will have attained the golden age of his retirement from\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nWhy be scheming?  Victor asked.  Unlike the gallant soldiery, his\r\nquestion was raised in the blush of a success, from an examination of the\r\nquality of the thing won; although it had not changed since it was first\r\ncoveted; it was demonstrably the same: and an astonishing dry stick he\r\nheld, as a reward for perpetual agitations and perversions of his natural\r\ntastes.  Here was a Dudley Sowerby, the direct issue of the conception of\r\nLakelands; if indeed they were not conceived together in one; and the\r\nyoung gentleman had moral character, good citizen substance, and station,\r\nrank, prospect of a title; and the grasp of him was firm.  Yet so far was\r\nit from hearty, that when hearing a professed satirist like Colney\r\nDurance remark on the decorous manner of Dudley's transparent courtship\r\nof the girl, under his look of an awakened approval of himself, that he\r\nappeared to be asking everybody:--Do you not think I bid fair for an\r\nexcellent father of Philistines?--Victor had a nip of spite at the\r\nthought of Dudley's dragging him bodily to be the grandfather.  Poor\r\nFredi, too!--necessarily the mother: condemned by her hard fate to feel\r\nproud of Philistine babies!  Though women soon get reconciled to it!  Or\r\ndo they?  They did once.  What if his Fredi turned out one of the modern\r\nyoung women, who have drunk of ideas?  He caught himself speculating on\r\nthat, as on a danger.  The alliance with Dudley really seemed to set him\r\nfacing backward.\r\n\r\nColney might not have been under prompting of Nataly when he derided\r\nDudley; but Victor was at war with the picture of her, in her compression\r\nof a cruel laugh, while her eyelids were hard shut, as if to exclude the\r\nyoung patriarch of Philistines' ridiculous image.\r\n\r\nHe hearkened to the Nature interrogating him, why had he stepped on a\r\npath to put division between himself and his beloved?--the smallest of\r\ngaps; and still the very smallest between nuptial lovers is a division--\r\nand that may become a mortal wound to their one-life.  Why had he roused\r\na slumbering world?  Glimpses of the world's nurse-like, old-fashioned,\r\nmother-nightcap benevolence to its kicking favourites; its long-suffering\r\ntolerance for the heroic breakers of its rough-cast laws, while the\r\ndecent curtain continues dropped, or lifted only ankle-high; together\r\nwith many scenes, lively suggestions, of the choice of ways he liked\r\nbest, told of things, which were better things, incomprehensibly\r\nforfeited.  So that the plain sense of value insisted on more than one\r\nweighing of the gain in hand: a dubious measure.\r\n\r\nHe was as little disposed to reject it as to stop his course at a goal of\r\nhis aim.  Nevertheless, a gain thus poorly estimated, could not command\r\nhim to do a deed of humiliation on account of it.  The speaking to this\r\ndry young Dudley was not imperative at present.  A word would do in the\r\nday to come.\r\n\r\nNataly was busy with her purchases of furniture, and the practise for the\r\ngreat August Concert.  He dealt her liberal encouragements, up to the\r\nverge of Dr. Themison's latest hummed words touching Mrs. Burman, from\r\nwhich he jumped in alarm lest he should paralyze her again: the dear\r\nsoul's dreaded aspect of an earthy pallor was a spectre behind her\r\ncheeks, ready to rush forth.  Fenellan brought Carling to dine with him;\r\nand Themison was confirmed by Carting, with incidents in proof; Caning by\r\nJarniman, also with incidents; one very odd one--or so it seemed, in the\r\nfury of the first savour of it:--she informed Jarniman, Skepsey said his\r\nfriend Jarniman said, that she had dreamed of making her appearance to\r\nhim on the night of the 23rd August, and of setting the date on the\r\ncalendar over his desk, when she entered his room: 'Sitting-room, not\r\nbedroom; she was always quite the lady,' Skepsey reported his Jarniman.\r\nMrs. Burman, as a ghost, would respect herself; she would keep to her\r\ncharacter.  Jarniman quite expected the dream to be verified; she was a\r\nwoman of her word: he believed she had received a revelation of the\r\napproaching fact: he was preparing for the scene.\r\n\r\nVictor had to keep silent and discourse of general prosperity.  His happy\r\nvivaciousness assisted him to feel it by day.  Nataly heard him at night,\r\non a moan: 'Poor soul!' and loudly once while performing an abrupt demi-\r\nvault from back to side: 'Perhaps now!' in a voice through doors.  She\r\nschooled herself to breathe equably.\r\n\r\nNot being allowed to impart the distressing dose of comfort he was\r\ncharged with, he swallowed it himself; and these were the consequences.\r\nAnd an uneasy sleep was traditionally a matter for grave debate in the\r\nRadnor family.  The Duvidney ladies, Dorothea and Virginia, would have\r\ncited ancestral names, showing it to be the worst of intimations.  At\r\nnight, lying on his back beneath a weight of darkness, one heavily craped\r\nfigure, distinguishable through the gloom, as a blot on a black pad,\r\naccused the answering darkness within him, until his mind was dragged to\r\ngo through the whole case by morning light; and the compassionate man\r\nappealed to common sense, to stamp and pass his delectable sophistries;\r\nas, that it was his intense humaneness, which exposed him to an\r\naccusation of inhumanity; his prayer for the truly best to happen, which\r\nanticipated Mrs. Burman's expiry.  They were simple sophistries,\r\nfabricated to suit his needs, readily taking and bearing the imprimatur\r\nof common sense.  They refreshed him, as a chemical scent a crowded room.\r\n\r\nAll because he could not open his breast to Nataly, by reason of her\r\nfeebleness; or feel enthusiasm in the possession of young Dudley!  A dry\r\nstick indeed beside him on the walk Westward.  Good quality wood, no\r\ndoubt, but dry, varnished for conventional uses.  Poor dear Fredi would\r\nhave to crown it like the May-day posy of the urchins of Craye Farm and\r\nCreckholt!\r\n\r\nDudley wished the great City-merchant to appreciate him as a diligent\r\nstudent of commercial matters: rivalries of Banks; Foreign and Municipal\r\nLoans, American Rails, and Argentine; new Companies of wholesome\r\nappearance or sinister; or starting with a dram in the stomach, or born\r\nto bleat prostrate, like sheep on their backs in a ditch; Trusts and\r\nFounders; Breweries bursting vats upon the markets, and England prone\r\nalong the gutters, gobbling, drunk for shares, and sober in the\r\npossession of certain of them.  But when, as Colney says, a grateful\r\nEngland has conferred the Lordship on her Brewer, he gratefully hands-\r\nover the establishment to his country; and both may disregard the howls\r\nof a Salvation Army of shareholders.--Beaten by the Germans in Brewery,\r\ntoo!  Dr. Schlesien has his right to crow.  We were ahead of them, and\r\nthey came and studied us, and they studied Chemistry as well; while we\r\nwent on down our happy-go-lucky old road; and then had to hire their\r\nyoung Professors, and then to import their beer.\r\n\r\nHave the Germans more brains than we English?  Victor's blood up to the\r\ndome of his cranium knocked the patriotic negative.  But, as old Colney\r\nsays (and bother him, for constantly intruding!), the comfortably\r\nsuccessful have the habit of sitting, and that dulls the brain yet more\r\nthan it eases the person: hence are we outpaced; we have now to know we\r\nare racing.  Victor scored a mark for one of his projects.  A well-\r\nconducted Journal of the sharpest pens in the land might, at a sacrifice\r\nof money grandly sunk, expose to his English how and to what degree their\r\nsports, and their fierce feastings, and their opposition to ideas, and\r\ntheir timidity in regard to change, and their execration of criticism\r\napplied to themselves, and their unanimous adoption of it for a weapon\r\nagainst others, are signs of a prolonged indulgence in the cushioned\r\nseat.  Victor saw it.  But would the people he loved?  He agreed with\r\nColney, forgetting the satirist's venom: to-wit; that the journalists\r\nshould be close under their editor's rod to put it in sound bold\r\nEnglish;--no metaphors, no similes, nor flowery insubstantiality: but\r\nhonest Saxon manger stuff: and put it repeatedly, in contempt of the\r\ndisgust of iteration; hammering so a soft place on the Anglican skull,\r\nwhich is rubbed in consequence, and taught at last through soreness to\r\nreflect.--A Journal?--with Colney Durance for Editor?--and called\r\nconformably THE WHIPPING-TOP?  Why not, if it exactly hits the\r\nsignification of the Journal and that which it would have the country do\r\nto itself, to keep it going and truly topping?  For there is no vulgarity\r\nin a title strongly signifying the intent.  Victor wrote it at night,\r\nnaming Colney for Editor, with a sum of his money to be devoted to the\r\npublication, in a form of memorandum; and threw it among the papers in\r\nhis desk.\r\n\r\nYoung Dudley had a funny inquisitiveness about Dartrey Fenellan; owing to\r\nFredi's reproduction or imitation of her mother's romantic sentiment for\r\nDartrey, doubtless: a bit of jealousy, indicating that the dry fellow had\r\nhis feelings.  Victor touched--off an outline of Dartrey's history and\r\ncharacter:--the half-brother of Simeon, considerably younger, and totally\r\ndifferent.  'Dartrey's mother was Lady Charlotte Kiltorne, one of the\r\nClanconans; better mother than wife, perhaps; and no reproach on her, not\r\na shadow; only she made the General's Bank-notes fly black paper.  And--\r\nif you 're for heredity--the queer point is, that Simeon, whose mother\r\nwas a sober-minded woman, has always been the spendthrift.  Dartrey\r\nmarried one of the Hennen women, all an odd lot, all handsome.  I met her\r\nonce.  Colney said, she came up here with a special commission from the\r\nPrince of Darkness.  There are women who stir the unholy in men--whether\r\nthey mean it or not, you know.'\r\n\r\nDudley pursed to remark, that he could not say he did know.  And good for\r\nFredi if he did not know, and had his objections to the knowledge!  But\r\nhe was like the men who escape colds by wrapping in comforters instead of\r\ntrusting to the spin of the blood.\r\n\r\n'She played poor Dartrey pranks before he buried--he, behaved well to\r\nher; and that says much for him; he has: a devil of a temper.  I 've seen\r\nthe blood in his veins, mount to cracking.  But there's the man: because\r\nshe was a woman, he never let it break out with her.  And, by heaven, he\r\nhad cause.  She couldn't be left.  She tricked him, and she loved him-\r\npassionately, I believe.  You don't understand women loving the husband\r\nthey drag through the mire?'\r\n\r\nDudley did not.  He sharpened his mouth.\r\n\r\n'Buried, you said, sir?--a widower?'\r\n\r\n'I've no positive information; we shall hear when he: comes back,' Victor\r\nreplied hurriedly.  'He got a drenching of all the damns in the British\r\nservice from his.  Generalissimo one day at a Review, for a trooper's\r\nnegligence-button or stock missing, or something; and off goes Dartrey to\r\nhis hut, and breaks his sword, and sends in his resignation.  Good\r\nsoldier lost.  And I can't complain; he has been a right-hand man to me\r\nover in Africa.  But a man ought to have some control of his temper,\r\nespecially a soldier.'\r\n\r\nDudley put emphasis into his acquiescence.\r\n\r\n'Worse than that temper of Dartrey's, he can't forgive an injury.  He\r\nbears a grudge against his country.  You've heard Colney Durance abuse\r\nold England.  It's three parts factitious-literary exercise.  It 's milk\r\nbeside the contempt of Dartrey's shrug.  He thinks we're a dead people,\r\nif a people; \"subsisting on our fat,\" as Colney says.'\r\n\r\n'I am not of opinion that we show it,' observed Dudley.\r\n\r\n'We don't,' Victor agreed.  He disrelished his companion's mincing tone\r\nof a monumental security, and yearned for Dartrey or Simeon or Colney to\r\nbe at his elbow rather than this most commendable of orderly citizens,\r\nwho little imagined the treacherous revolt from him in the bosom of the\r\ngentleman cordially signifying full agreement.  But Dudley was not gifted\r\nto read behind words and looks.\r\n\r\nThey were in the Park of the dwindling press of carriages, and here was\r\nthis young Dudley saying, quite commendably: 'It's a pity we seem to have\r\nno means of keeping our parks select.'\r\n\r\nVictor flung Simeon Fenellan at him in thought.  He remembered a fable of\r\nFenellan's, about a Society of the Blest, and the salt it was to them to\r\ndiscover an intruder from below, and the consequent accelerated measure\r\nin their hymning.\r\n\r\n'Have you seen anything offensive to you?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'One sees notorious persons.'\r\n\r\nDudley spoke aloof from them--'out of his cold attics,' Fenellan would\r\nhave said.\r\n\r\nVictor approved: with the deadened feeling common to us when first in sad\r\nearnest we consent to take life as it is.\r\n\r\nHe perceived, too, the comicality of his having to resign himself to the\r\nfatherly embrace of goodness.\r\n\r\nLakelands had him fast, and this young Dudley was the kernel of\r\nLakelands.  If he had only been intellectually a little flexible in his\r\nmorality!  But no; he wore it cap a pie, like a mediaeval knight his\r\narmour.  One had to approve.  And there was no getting away from him.  He\r\nwas good enough to stay in town for the practise of the opening overture\r\nof the amateurs, and the flute-duet, when his family were looking for him\r\nat Tunbridge Wells; and almost every day Victor was waylaid by him at a\r\ncorner of the Strand.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, Victor appeared at the point of interception armed with\r\nColney Durance, for whom he had called in the Temple, bent on self-\r\ndefence, although Colney was often as bitter to his taste as to Dudley's.\r\nLatterly the bitter had become a tonic.  We rejoice in the presence of\r\ngoodness, let us hope; and still an impersonation of conventional,\r\ngoodness perpetually about us depresses.  Dudley drove him to Colney for\r\nrelief.  Besides it pleased Nataly that he should be bringing Colney\r\nhome; it looked to her as if he were subjecting Dudley to critical\r\ninspection before he decided a certain question much, and foolishly,\r\ndreaded by the dear soul.  That quieted her.  And another thing, she\r\nliked him to be with Colney, for a clog on him; as it were, a tuning-fork\r\nfor the wild airs he started.  A little pessimism, also, she seemed to\r\nlike; probably as an appeasement after hearing, and having to share, high\r\nflights.  And she was, in her queer woman's way, always reassured by his\r\nendurance of Colney's company:--she read it to mean, that he could bear\r\nColney's perusal of him, and satiric stings.  Victor had seen these petty\r\nmatters among the various which were made to serve his double and treble\r\npurposes; now, thanks to the operation of young Dudley within him, he\r\nfelt them.  Preferring Fenellan's easy humour to Colney's acid, he was\r\nnevertheless braced by the latter's antidote to Dudley, while reserving\r\nhis entire opposition in the abstract.\r\n\r\nFor Victor Radnor and Colney Durance were the Optimist and Pessimist of\r\ntheir society.  They might have headed those tribes in the country.  At a\r\nperiod when the omnibus of the world appears to its quaint occupants to\r\nbe going faster, men are shaken into the acceptation, if not performance,\r\nof one part or the other as it is dictated to them by their temperaments.\r\nCompose the parts, and you come nigh to the meaning of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury: the mother of these gosling affirmatives and negatives divorced\r\nfrom harmony and awakened by the slight increase of incubating motion to\r\nvitality.  Victor and Colney had been champion duellists for the rosy and\r\nthe saturnine since the former cheerfully slaved for a small stipend in\r\nthe City of his affection, and the latter entered on an inheritance\r\ncounted in niggard hundreds, that withdrew a briefless barrister disposed\r\nfor scholarship from the forlornest of seats in the Courts.  They had\r\nforetold of one another each the unfulfilled; each claimed the actual as\r\nthe child of his prediction.  Victor was to have been ruined long back;\r\nColney the prey of independent bachelors.  Colney had escaped his harpy,\r\nand Victor could be called a millionaire and more.  Prophesy was crowned\r\nby Colney's dyspepsia, by Victor's ticklish domestic position.  Their\r\npity for one another, their warm regard, was genuine; only, they were of\r\ndifferent temperaments; and we have to distinguish, that in many\r\nestimable and some gifted human creatures, it is the quality of the blood\r\nwhich directs the current of opinion.\r\n\r\nVictor played-off Colney upon Dudley, for his internal satisfaction, and\r\nto lull Nataly and make her laugh; but he could not, as she hoped he was\r\ndoing, take Colney into his confidence; inasmuch as the Optimist,\r\nimpelled by his exuberant anticipatory trustfulness, is an author, and\r\ndoes things; whereas the Pessimist is your chaired critic, with the\r\ndelivery of a censor, generally an undoer of things.  Our Optimy has his\r\ninstinct to tell him of the cast of Pessimy's countenance at the\r\nconfession of a dilemma-foreseen!  He hands himself to Pessimy, as it\r\nwere a sugar-cane, for the sour brute to suck the sugar and whack with\r\nthe wood.  But he cannot perform his part in return; he gets no\r\ncompensation: Pessimy is invulnerable.  You waste your time in hurling a\r\ncommon 'tu-quoque' at one who hugs the worst.\r\n\r\nThe three walking in the park, with their bright view, and black view,\r\nand neutral view of life, were a comical trio.  They had come upon the\r\ndays of the unfanned electric furnace, proper to London's early August\r\nwhen it is not pipeing March.  Victor complacently bore heat as well as\r\ncold: but young Dudley was a drought, and Colney a drug to refresh it;\r\nand why was he stewing in London?  It was for this young Dudley, who\r\nresembled a London of the sparrowy roadways and wearisome pavements and\r\nblocks of fortress mansions, by chance a water-cart spirting a stale\r\nwater: or a London of the farewell dinner-parties, where London's\r\nprofessed anecdotist lays the dust with his ten times told: Why was not\r\nNataly relieved of her dreary round of the purchases of furniture!  They\r\nought all now to be in Switzerland or Tyrol.  Nesta had of late been\r\nturning over leaves of an Illustrated book of Tyrol, dear to her after a\r\nrun through the Innthal to the Dolomites one splendid August; and she and\r\nNataly had read there of Hofer, Speckbacker, Haspinger; and wrath had\r\nfilled them at the meanness of the Corsican, who posed after it as victim\r\non St. Helena's rock; the scene in grey dawn on Mantua's fortress-walls\r\nblasting him in the Courts of History, when he strikes for his pathetic\r\nsublime.\r\n\r\nVictor remembered how he had been rhetorical, as the mouthpiece of his\r\ndarlings.  But he had in memory prominently now the many glorious\r\npictures of that mountain-land beckoning to him, waving him to fly forth\r\nfrom the London oven:--lo, the Tyrolese limestone crags with livid peaks\r\nand snow lining shelves and veins of the crevices; and folds of pinewood\r\nundulations closed by a shoulder of snow large on the blue; and a\r\ndazzling pinnacle rising over green pasture-Alps, the head of it shooting\r\naloft as the blown billow, high off a broken ridge, and wide-armed in its\r\npure white shroud beneath; tranced, but all motion in immobility, to the\r\nheart in the eye; a splendid image of striving, up to crowned victory.\r\nAnd see the long valley-sweeps of the hanging meadows and maize, and\r\nlower vineyards and central tall green spires!  Walking beside young\r\nDudley, conversing, observing too, Victor followed the trips and twists\r\nof a rill, that was lured a little further down through scoops, ducts,\r\nand scaffolded channels to serve a wainwright.\r\n\r\nHe heard the mountain-song of the joyful water: a wren-robin-thrush on\r\nthe dance down of a faun; till it was caught and muted, and the silver\r\nfoot slid along the channel, swift as moonbeams through a cloud, with an\r\nair of 'Whither you will, so it be on'; happy for service as in freedom.\r\nThen the yard of the inn below, and the rillwater twirling rounded\r\nthrough the trout-trough, subdued, still lively for its beloved onward:\r\ndues to business, dues to pleasure; a wedding of the two, and the wisest\r\non earth:-eh?  like some one we know, and Nataly has made the comparison.\r\nFresh forellen for lunch: rhyming to Fenellan, he had said to her; and\r\nthat recollection struck the day to blaze; for his friend was a ruined\r\nmilitary captain living on a literary quill at the time; and Nataly's\r\ntender pleading, 'Could you not help to give him another chance, dear\r\nVictor?'--signifying her absolute trust in his ability to do that or more\r\nor anything, had actually set him thinking of the Insurance Office; which\r\nhe started to prosperity, and Fenellan in it, previously an untutored\r\nrill of the mountains, if ever was one.\r\n\r\nUseless to be dwelling on holiday pictures: Lakelands had hold of him!\r\n\r\nColney or somebody says, that the greater our successes, the greater the\r\nslaves we become.--But we must have an aim, my friend, and success must\r\nbe the aim of any aim!--Yes, and, says Colney, you are to rejoice in the\r\ndisappointing miss, which saved you from being damned by your bullet on\r\nthe centre.--You're dead against Nature, old Colney.--That is to carry\r\nthe flag of Liberty.--By clipping a limb!\r\n\r\nVictor overcame the Pessimist in his own royal cranium-Court.  He\r\nentertained a pronounced dissension with bachelors pretending to\r\nindependence.  It could not be argued publicly, and the more the pity:--\r\nfor a slight encouragement, he would have done it: his outlook over the\r\nwaves of bachelors and (by present conditions mostly constrained)\r\nspinsters--and another outlook, midnight upon Phlegethon to the thoughts\r\nof men, made him deem it urgent.  And it helped the plea in his own\r\nexcuse, as Colney pointed out to the son of Nature.  That, he had to\r\nadmit, was true.  He charged it upon Mrs. Burman, for twisting the most\r\nunselfish and noblest of his thoughts; and he promised himself it was to\r\ncease on the instant when the circumstance, which Nature was remiss in\r\nnot bringing about to-day or to-morrow, had come to pass.  He could see\r\nhis Nataly's pained endurance beneath her habitual submission.  Her\r\neffort was a poor one, to conceal her dread of the day of the gathering\r\nat Lakelands.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday previous to the day, Dr. Themison accompanied the amateurs\r\nby rail to Wrensham, to hear 'trial of the acoustics' of the Concert-\r\nhall.  They were a goodly company; and there was fun in the railway-\r\ncarriage over Colney's description of Fashionable London's vast octopus\r\nMalady-monster, who was letting the doctor fly to the tether of its\r\nlongest filament for an hour, plying suckers on him the while.  He had\r\nthe look, to general perception, of a man but half-escaped: and as when\r\nthe notes of things taken by the vision in front are being set down upon\r\ntablets in the head behind.  Victor observed his look at Nataly.  The\r\nlook was like a door aswing, revealing in concealing.  She was not or did\r\nnot appear struck by it; perhaps, if observant, she took it for a busy\r\nprofessional gentleman's holiday reckoning of the hours before the return\r\ntrain to his harness, and his arrangements for catching it.  She was, as\r\nshe could be on a day of trial, her enchanting majestic self again--\r\ndefying suspicions.  She was his true mate for breasting a world honoured\r\nin uplifting her.\r\n\r\nHer singing of a duet with Nesta, called forth Dr. Themison's very warm\r\napplause.  He named the greatest of contraltos.  Colney did better\r\nservice than Fenellan at the luncheon-table: he diverted Nataly and\r\ncaptured Dr. Themison's ear with the narrative of his momentous\r\nexpedition of European Emissaries, to plead the cause of their several\r\nlanguages at the Court of Japan: a Satiric Serial tale, that hit\r\nincidentally the follies of the countries of Europe, and intentionally,\r\none had to think, those of Old England.  Nesta set him going.  Just when\r\nhe was about to begin, she made her father laugh by crying out in a\r\nrapture, 'Oh!  Delphica!'  For she was naughtily aware of Dudley\r\nSowerby's distaste for the story and disgust with the damsel Delphica.\r\n\r\nNesta gave Dr. Themison the preliminary sketch of the grand object of the\r\nexpedition: indeed one of the eminent ones of the world; matter for an\r\nEpic; though it is to be feared, that our part in it will not encourage a\r\nCis-Atlantic bard.  To America the honours from beginning to end belong.\r\n\r\nSo, then, Japan has decided to renounce its language, for the adoption of\r\nthe language it may choose among the foremost famous European tongues.\r\nJapan becomes the word for miraculous transformations of a whole people\r\nat the stroke of a wand; and let our English enrol it as the most\r\nprecious of the powerful verbs.  An envoy visits the principal Seats of\r\nLearning in Europe.  He is of a gravity to match that of his unexampled\r\nand all but stupefying mission.  A fluent linguist, yet an Englishman,\r\nthe slight American accent contracted during a lengthened residence in\r\nthe United States is no bar to the patriotism urging him to pay his visit\r\nof exposition and invitation from the Japanese Court to the distinguished\r\nDoctor of Divinity Dr. Bouthoin.  The renown of Dr. Bouthoin among the\r\nlearned of Japan has caused the special invitation to him; a scholar\r\nendowed by an ample knowledge and persuasive eloquence to cite and\r\ninstance as well as illustrate the superior advantages to Japan and\r\ncivilization in the filial embrace of mother English.  'For to this it\r\nmust come predestinated,' says the astonishing applicant.  'We seem to\r\nsee a fitness in it,' says the cogitative Rev. Doctor.  'And an Island\r\nEngland in those waters, will do wonders for Commerce,' adds the former.\r\n'We think of things more pregnant,' concludes the latter, with a dry\r\ngleam of ecclesiastical knowingness.  And let the Editor of the Review\r\nupon his recent pamphlet, and let the prelate reprimanding him, and let\r\nthe newspapers criticizing his pure Saxon, have a care!\r\n\r\nFunds, universally the most convincing of credentials, are placed at Dr.\r\nBouthoin's disposal: only it is requested, that for the present the\r\nexpedition be secret.  'Better so,' says pure Saxon's champion.  On a day\r\npatented for secresy, and swearing-in the whole American Continent\r\nthrough the cables to keep the secret by declaring the patent, the Rev.\r\nDr. Bouthoin, accompanied by his curate, the Rev. Mancate Semhians,\r\nstumbling across portmanteaux crammed with lexicons and dictionaries and\r\nother tubes of the voice of Hermes, takes possession of berths in the\r\nship Polypheme, bound, as they mutually conceive, for the biggest\r\nadventure ever embarked on by a far-thoughted, high-thoughted, patriotic\r\npair speaking pure Saxon or other.\r\n\r\nColney, with apologies to his hearers, avoided the custom of our period\r\n(called the Realistic) to create, when casual opportunity offers, a\r\nbelief in the narrative by promoting nausea in the audience.  He passed\r\nunder veil the Rev. Doctor's acknowledgement of Neptune's power, and the\r\ntemporary collapse of Mr. Semhians.  Proceeding at once to the comments\r\nof these high-class missionaries on the really curious inquisitiveness of\r\ncertain of the foreign passengers on board, he introduced to them the\r\nindisputably learned, the very argumentative, crashing, arrogant,\r\npedantic, dogmatic, philological German gentleman, Dr. Gannius, reeking\r\nof the Teutonic Professor, as a library volume of its leather.  With him\r\nis his fairhaired artless daughter Delphica.  An interesting couple for\r\nthe beguilement of a voyage: she so beautifully moderates his irascible\r\nincisiveness!  Yet there is a strange tone that they have.  What, then,\r\nof the polite, the anecdotic Gallic M. Falarique, who studiously engages\r\nthe young lady in colloquy when Mr. Semhians is agitating outside them to\r\nsay a word?  What of that outpouring, explosive, equally voluble,\r\nuncontrolled M. Bobinikine, a Mongol Russian, shaped, featured, hued like\r\nthe pot-boiled, round and tight young dumpling of our primitive boyhood,\r\nwhich smokes on the dish from the pot?  And what of another, hitherto\r\nunnoticed, whose nose is of the hooked vulturine, whose name transpires\r\nas Pisistratus Mytharete?  He hears Dr. Bouthoin declaim some lines of\r\nHomer, and beseeches him for the designation of that language.  Greek,\r\nis it?  Greek of the Asiatic ancient days of the beginning of the poetic\r\nchants?  Dr. Gannius crashes cachinnation.  Dr. Bouthoin caps himself\r\nwith the offended Don.  Mr. Semhians opens half an eye and a whole mouth.\r\nThere must be a mystery, these two exclaim to one another in privacy.\r\nDelphica draws Mr. Semhians aside.\r\n\r\nBlushing over his white necktie, like the coast of Labrador at the\r\ntransient wink of its Jack-in-the-box Apollo, Mr. Semhians faintly tells\r\nof a conversation he has had with the ingenuous fair one; and she ardent\r\nas he for the throning of our incomparable Saxon English in the mouths of\r\nthe races of mankind.  Strange!--she partly suspects the Frenchman, the\r\nRussian, the attentive silent Greek, to be all of them bound for the\r\nCourt of Japan.  Concurrents?  Can it be?  We are absolutely to enter on\r\na contention with rivals?  Dr. Bouthoin speaks to Dr. Gannius.  He is\r\nastonished, he says; he could not have imagined it\r\n\r\n'Have you ever imagined anything?' Dr. Gannius asks him.  Entomologist,\r\nbotanist, palaeontologist, philologist, and at sound of horn a ready\r\nregimental corporal, Dr. Gannius wears good manners as a pair of bath-\r\nslippers, to rally and kick his old infant of an Englishman; who, in awe\r\nof his later renown and manifest might, makes it a point of discretion to\r\nbe ultra-amiable; for he certainly is not in training, he has no\r\nalliances, and he must diplomatize; and the German is a strong one; a\r\nrelative too; he is the Saxon's cousin, to say the least.  This German\r\nhas the habit of pushing past politeness to carry his argumentative war\r\ninto the enemy's country: and he presents on all sides a solid rampart\r\nof recent great deeds done, and mailed readiness for the doing of more,\r\nif we think of assailing him in that way.  We are really like the poor\r\nbeasts which have cast their shells or cases, helpless flesh to his beak.\r\nSo we are cousinly.\r\n\r\nWhether more amused than amazed, we know not, Dr. Gannius hears from 'our\r\nsimpleton of the pastures,' as he calls the Rev. Doctor to his daughter,\r\nthat he and Mr. Semhians have absolutely pushed forth upon this most\r\nmighty of enterprises naked of any backing from their Government!  Babes\r\nin the Wood that they are!  'a la grace de dieu' at every turn that cries\r\nfor astutia, they show no sign or symbol of English arms behind them, to\r\nsupport--and with the grandest of national prizes in view!--the pleading\r\noration before the Court of the elect, erudites, we will call them, of an\r\nintelligent, yet half barbarous, people; hesitating, these, between\r\neloquence and rival eloquence, cunning and rival cunning.  Why, in such a\r\ncase, the shadow-nimbus of Force is needed to decide the sinking of the\r\nscale.  But have these English never read their Shakespeare, that they\r\nshow so barren an acquaintance with human, to say nothing of semi-\r\nbarbaric, nature?  But it is here that we Germans prove our claim to\r\nbeing the sons of his mind.--Dr. Gannius, in contempt, throws off the\r\nmask: he also is a concurrent.  And not only is he the chosen by election\r\nof the chief Universities of his land, he has behind him, as Athene\r\ndilating Achilles, the clenched fist of the Prince of thunder and\r\nlightning of his time.  German, Japan shall be!  he publicly swears\r\nbefore them all.  M. Falarique damascenes his sharpest smile;\r\nM. Bobinikine double-dimples his puddingest; M. Mytharete rolls a\r\nforefinger over his beak; Dr. Bouthoin enlarges his eye on a sunny mote.\r\nAnd such is the masterful effect of a frank diplomacy, that when one\r\nparty shows his hand, the others find the reverse of concealment in\r\nhiding their own.\r\n\r\nDr. Bouthoin and Mr. Semhians are compelled to suspect themselves to be\r\nencompassed with rivals, presumptively supported by their Governments.\r\nThe worthy gentlemen had hoped to tumble into good fortune, as in the\r\nblessed old English manner.  'It has even been thus with us: unhelped we\r\ndo it!' exclaims the Rev. Doctor.  He is roused from dejection by hearing\r\nMr. Semhians shyly (he has published verse) tell of the fairtressed\r\nDelphica's phosphorial enthusiasm for our galaxy of British Poets.\r\nAssisted by Mr. Semhians, he begins to imagine, that he has, in the\r\nperson of this artless devotee an ally, who will, through her worship of\r\nour poets (by treachery to her sire-a small matter) sacrifice her\r\nguttural tongue, by enabling him (through the exercise of her arts,\r\ncharms, intrigues--also a small matter) to obtain the first audience of\r\nthe Japanese erudites.  Delphica, with each of the rivals in turn, is\r\nvery pretty Comedy.  She is aware that M. Falarique is her most\r\nredoubtable adversary, by the time that the vast fleet of steamboats\r\n(containing newspaper reporters) is beheld from the decks of the\r\nPolypheme puffing past Sandy Hook.\r\n\r\nThere Colney left them, for the next instalment of the serial.\r\n\r\nNesta glanced at Dudley Sowerby.  She liked him for his pained frown at\r\nthe part his countrymen were made to play, but did wish that he would\r\nkeep from expressing it in a countenance that suggested a worried knot;\r\nand mischievously she said: 'Do you take to Delphica?'\r\n\r\nHe replied, with an evident sincerity, 'I cannot say I do.'\r\n\r\nHad Mr. Semhians been modelled on him?\r\n\r\n'One bets on the German, of course--with Colney Durance,' Victor said to\r\nDr. Themison, leading him over the grounds of Lakelands.\r\n\r\n'In any case, the author teaches us to feel an interest in the rivals.\r\nI want to know what comes of it,' said the doctor.\r\n\r\n'There's a good opportunity, one sees.  But, mark me, it will all end in\r\nsatire upon poor Old England.  According to Colney, we excel in nothing.'\r\n\r\n'I do not think there is a country that could offer the entertainment for\r\nwhich I am indebted to you to-day.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, my friend, and you like their voices?  The contralto?'\r\n\r\n'Exquisite.'\r\n\r\nDr. Themison had not spoken the name of Radnor.\r\n\r\n'Shall we see you at our next Concert-evening in town?' said Victor; and\r\nhearing 'the privilege' mentioned, his sharp bright gaze cleared to\r\nlimpid.  'You have seen how it stands with us here!'  At once he related\r\nwhat indeed Dr. Themison had begun speculatively to think might be the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nMrs. Burman Radnor had dropped words touching a husband, and of her\r\ndesire to communicate with him, in the event of her being given over to\r\nthe surgeons: she had said, that her husband was a greatly gifted man;\r\nsetting her head in a compassionate swing.  This revelation of the\r\nhusband soon after, was filling.  And this Mr. Radnor's comrade's manner\r\nof it, was winning: a not too self-justifying tone; not void of feeling\r\nfor the elder woman; with a manly eulogy of the younger, who had flung\r\naway the world for him and borne him their one dear child.  Victor took\r\nthe blame wholly upon himself.  'It is right that you should know,' he\r\nsaid to the doctor's thoughtful posture; and he stressed the blame; and a\r\nflame shot across his eyeballs.  He brought home to his hearer the\r\nhurricane of a man he was in the passion: indicating the subjection of\r\nsuch a temperament as this Victor Radnor's to trials of the moral\r\nrestraints beyond his human power.\r\n\r\nDr. Themison said: 'Would you--we postpone that as long as we can: but\r\nsupposing the poor lady .  .  . ?'\r\n\r\nVictor broke in: 'I see her wish: I will.'\r\n\r\nThe clash of his answer rang beside Dr. Themison's faltering query.\r\n\r\nWe are grateful when spared the conclusion of a sentence born to stammer.\r\nIf for that only, the doctor pressed Victor's hand warmly.\r\n\r\n'I may, then, convey some form of assurance, that a request of the kind\r\nwill be granted?' he said.\r\n\r\n'She has but to call me to her,' said Victor, stiffening his back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT ASSEMBLY AT LAKELANDS\r\n\r\nRound the neighbourhood of Lakelands it was known that the day of the\r\ngreat gathering there had been authoritatively foretold as fine, by Mr.\r\nVictor Radnor; and he delivered his prophecy in the teeth of the South-\r\nwestern gale familiar to our yachting month; and he really inspired\r\nbelief or a kind of trust; some supposing him to draw from reserves of\r\nobservation, some choosing to confide in the singularly winged sparkle of\r\nhis eyes.  Lady Rodwell Blachington did; and young Mrs. Blathenoy; and\r\nMrs. Fanning; they were enamoured of it.  And when women stand for Hope,\r\nand any worshipped man for Promise, nothing less than redoubled confusion\r\nof him dissolves the union.  Even then they cling to it, under an\r\nejaculation, that it might and should have been otherwise; fancy partly\r\nhas it otherwise, in her caerulean home above the weeping.  So it is good\r\nat all points to prophecy with the aspect of the radiant day foretold.\r\n\r\nA storm, bearing battle overhead, tore the night to pieces.  Nataly's\r\nfaith in the pleasant prognostic wavered beneath the crashes.  She had\r\nnot much power of heart to desire anything save that which her bosom\r\ndisavowed.  Uproar rather appeased her, calmness agitated.  She wished\r\nher beloved to be spared from a disappointment, thinking he deserved all\r\nsuccesses, because of the rigours inflicted by her present tonelessness\r\nof blood and being.  Her unresponsive manner with him was not due to lack\r\nof fire in the blood or a loss of tenderness.  The tender feeling, under\r\nprivations unwillingly imposed, though willingly shared, now suffused her\r\nreflections, owing to a gratitude induced by a novel experience of him;\r\nknown, as it may chance, and as it does not always chance, to both sexes\r\nin wedded intimacy here and there; known to women whose mates are proved\r\nquick to compliance with delicate intuitions of their moods of nature.\r\nA constant, almost visible, image of the dark thing she desired, and was\r\nbound not to desire, and was remorseful for desiring, oppressed her; a\r\nperpetual consequent warfare of her spirit and the nature subject to the\r\nthousand sensational hypocrisies invoked for concealment of its reviled\r\nbrutish baseness, held the woman suspended from her emotions.  She coldly\r\nfelt that a caress would have melted her, would have been the temporary\r\nrapture.  Coldly she had the knowledge that the considerate withholding\r\nof it helped her spirit to escape a stain.  Less coldly, she thanked at\r\nheart her beloved, for being a gentleman in their yoke.  It plighted them\r\nover flesh.\r\n\r\nHe talked to her on the pillow, just a few sentences; and, unlike\r\nhimself, a word of City affairs: 'That fellow Blathenoy, with his\r\nincreasing multitude of bills at the Bank: must watch him there, sit\r\nthere regularly.  One rather likes his wife.  By the way, if you see him\r\nnear me to-morrow, praise the Spanish climate; don't forget.  He heads\r\nthe subscription list of Lady Blachington's Charity.'\r\n\r\nVictor chuckled at Colney's humping of shoulders and mouth, while the\r\ntempest seemed echoing a sulphurous pessimist.  'If old Colney had\r\nlistened to me, when India gave proof of the metal and South Africa began\r\nheaving, he'd have been a fairly wealthy man by now .  .  .  ha!  it\r\nwould have genialized him.  A man may be a curmudgeon with money: the\r\nrule is for him to cuddle himself and take a side, instead of dashing at\r\nhis countrymen all round and getting hated.  Well, Colney popular, can't\r\nbe imagined; but entertaining guests would have diluted his acid.  He has\r\nthe six hundred or so a year he started old bachelor on; add his\r\nmiserable pay for Essays.  Literature!  Of course, he sours.  But don't\r\nlet me hear of bachelors moralists.  There he sits at his Temple Chambers\r\nhatching epigrams .  .  .  pretends to have the office of critic!  Honest\r\nold fellow, as far as his condition permits.  I tell him it will be fine\r\nto-morrow.'\r\n\r\n'You are generally right, dear,' Nataly said.\r\n\r\nHer dropping breath was audible.\r\n\r\nVictor smartly commended her to slumber, with heaven's blessing on her\r\nand a dose of soft nursery prattle.\r\n\r\nHe squeezed her hand.  He kissed her lips by day.  She heard him sigh\r\nsettling himself into the breast of night for milk of sleep, like one of\r\nthe world's good children.  She could have turned to him, to show him she\r\nwas in harmony with the holy night and loving world, but for the fear\r\nfounded on a knowledge of the man he was; it held her frozen to the\r\nsemblance of a tombstone lady beside her lord, in the aisle where horror\r\nkindles pitchy blackness with its legions at one movement.  Verily it was\r\nthe ghost of Mrs. Burman come to the bed, between them.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the sun of Victor Radnor's popularity was already up over the\r\nextended circle likely to be drenched by a falsification of his daring\r\naugury, though the scud flew swift, and the beeches raved, and the oaks\r\nroared and snarled, and pine-trees fell their lengths.  Fine tomorrow, to\r\na certainty!  he had been heard to say.  The doubt weighed for something;\r\nthe balance inclined with the gentleman who had become so popular: for he\r\nhad done the trick so suddenly, like a stroke of the wizard; and was a\r\nreal man, not one of your spangled zodiacs selling for sixpence and\r\nhopping to a lucky hit, laughed at nine times out of ten.  The reasoning\r\nwent--and it somewhat affected the mansion as well as the cottage,--that\r\nif he had become popular in this astonishing fashion, after making one of\r\nthe biggest fortunes of modern times, he might, he must, have secret\r\ngifts.  'You can't foretell weather!' cried a pothouse sceptic.  But the\r\nworkmen at Lakelands declared that he had foretold it.  Sceptics among\r\nthe common folk were quaintly silenced by other tales of him, being a\r\nwhiff from the delirium attending any mention of his name.\r\n\r\nHow had he become suddenly so popular as to rouse in the mind of Mr.\r\nCaddis, the sitting Member for the division of the county (said to have\r\nthe seat in his pocket), a particular inquisitiveness to know the bearing\r\nof his politics?  Mr. Radnor was rich, true: but these are days when\r\nwealthy men, ambitious of notoriety, do not always prove faithful to\r\ntheir class; some of them are cunning to bid for the suffrages of the\r\nirresponsible, recklessly enfranchised, corruptible masses.  Mr. Caddis,\r\nif he had the seat in his pocket, had it from the support of a class\r\ntrusting him to support its interests: he could count on the landowners,\r\non the clergy, on the retired or retiring or comfortably cushioned\r\nmerchants resident about Wrensham, on the many obsequious among electoral\r\nshopmen; annually he threw open his grounds, and he subscribed,\r\npatronized, did what was expected; and he was not popular; he was\r\nunpopular.  Why?  But why was the sun of this 23rd August, shining from\r\nits rise royally upon pacified, enrolled and liveried armies of cloud,\r\nmore agreeable to earth's populations than his pinched appearance of the\r\npoor mopped red nose and melancholic rheumy eyelets on a January day!\r\nUndoubtedly Victor Radnor risked his repute of prophet.  Yet his\r\npopularity would have survived the continuance of the storm and deluge.\r\nHe did this:--and the mystery puzzling the suspicious was nothing\r\nwonderful: in addition to a transparent benevolence, he spread a sort of\r\nassurance about him, that he thought the better of the people for their\r\nthinking well of themselves.  It came first from the workmen at his\r\nhouse.  'The right sort, and no humbug: likes you to be men.'  Such a\r\nreport made tropical soil for any new seed.\r\n\r\nNow, it is a postulate, to strengthen all poor commoners, that not even\r\nin comparison with the highest need we be small unless we yield to think\r\nit of ourselves.  Do but stretch a hand to the touch of earth in you, and\r\nyou spring upon combative manhood again, from the basis where all are\r\nequal.  Humanity's historians, however, tell us, that the exhilaration\r\nbringing us consciousness of a stature, is gas which too frequently has\r\nto be administered.  Certes the cocks among men do not require the\r\nprocess; they get it off the sight of the sun arising or a simple hen\r\nsubmissive: but we have our hibernating bears among men, our yoked oxen,\r\ncab horses, beaten dogs; we have on large patches of these Islands, a\r\nSaxon population, much wanting assistance, if they are not to feel\r\nthemselves beaten, driven, caught by the neck, yoked and heavyheaded.\r\nBlest, then, is he who gives them a sense of the pride of standing on\r\nlegs.  Beer, ordinarily their solitary helper beneath the iron canopy of\r\nwealth, is known to them as a bitter usurer; it knocks them flat in their\r\npersons and their fortunes, for the short spell of recreative exaltation.\r\nThey send up their rough glory round the name of the gentleman--a\r\nstranger, but their friend: and never is friend to be thought of as a\r\nstranger--who manages to get the holiday for Wrensham and thereabout,\r\nthat they may hurl away for one jolly day the old hat of a doddered\r\nhumbleness, and trip to the strains of the internal music he has unwound.\r\n\r\nSays he: Is it a Charity Concert?  Charity begins at home, says he: and\r\nif I welcome you gentry on behalf of the poor of London, why, it follows\r\nyou grant me the right to make a beginning with the poor of our parts\r\ndown here.  He puts it so, no master nor mistress neither could refuse\r\nhim.  Why, the workmen at his house were nigh pitching the contractors\r\nall sprawling on a strike, and Mr. Radnor takes train, harangues 'em and\r\nrubs 'em smooth; ten minutes by the clock, they say; and return train to\r\nhis business in town; by reason of good sense and feeling, it was; poor\r\nmen don't ask for more.  A working man, all the world over, asks but\r\njustice and a little relaxation--just a collar of fat to his lean.\r\n\r\nMr. Caddis, M.P., pursuing the riddle of popularity, which irritated and\r\nrepelled as constantly as it attracted him, would have come nearer to an\r\ninstructive presentment of it, by listening to these plain fellows, than\r\nhe was in the line of equipages, at a later hour of the day.  The remarks\r\nof the comfortably cushioned and wheeled, though they be eulogistic to\r\nextravagance, are vapourish when we court them for nourishment;\r\nsubstantially, they are bones to the cynical.  He heard enumerations of\r\nMr. Radnor's riches, eclipsing his own past compute.  A merchant, a\r\nholder of mines, Director of a mighty Bank, projector of running rails,\r\na princely millionaire, and determined to be popular--what was the aim of\r\nthe man?  It is the curse of modern times, that we never can be sure of\r\nour Parliamentary seat; not when we have it in our pockets!  The Romans\r\nhave left us golden words with regard to the fickleness of the populace;\r\nwe have our Horace, our Juvenal, we have our Johnson; and in this vaunted\r\nage of reason it is, that we surrender ourselves into the hands of the\r\npopulace!  Panem et circenses!  Mr. Caddis repeated it, after his\r\nfathers; his fathers and he had not headed them out of that original\r\nvoracity.  There they were, for moneyed legislators to bewail their\r\nappetites.  And it was an article of his legislation, to keep them there.\r\n\r\nPedestrian purchasers of tickets for the Charity Concert, rather openly,\r\nin an envelope of humour, confessed to the bait of the Radnor bread with\r\nbit of fun.  Savoury rumours were sweeping across Wrensham.  Mr. Radnor\r\nhad borrowed footmen of the principal houses about.  Cartloads of\r\nprovisions had been seen to come.  An immediate reward of a deed of\r\nbenevolence, is a thing sensibly heavenly; and the five-shilling tickets\r\nwere paid for as if for a packet on the counter.  Unacquainted with Mr.\r\nRadnor, although the reports of him struck a summons to their gastric\r\njuices, resembling in its effect a clamorous cordiality, they were\r\nchilled, on their steps along the halfrolled new gravel-roads to the\r\nhouse, by seeing three tables of prodigious length, where very evidently\r\na feast had raged: one to plump the people--perhaps excessively courted\r\nby great gentlemen of late; shopkeepers, the villagers, children.  These\r\nhad been at it for two merry hours.  They had risen.  They were beef and\r\npudding on legs; in some quarters, beer amiably manifest, owing to the\r\nflourishes of a military band.  Boys, who had shaken room through their\r\nmagical young corporations for fresh stowage, darted out of a chasing\r\ncircle to the crumbled cornucopia regretfully forsaken fifteen minutes\r\nback, and buried another tart.  Plenty still reigned: it was the will of\r\nthe Master that it should.\r\n\r\nWe divert our attention, resigned in stoic humour, to the bill of the\r\nConcert music, handed us with our tickets at the park-gates: we have no\r\nright to expect refreshment; we came for the music, to be charitable.\r\nSignora Bianca Luciani: of whom we have read almost to the hearing her;\r\nenough to make the mistake at times.  The grand violinist Durandarte:\r\nforcibly detained on his way to America.  Mr. Radnor sent him a blank\r\ncheque:--no!--so Mr. Radnor besought him in person: he is irresistible;\r\na great musician himself; it is becoming quite the modern style.  We have\r\nnow English noblemen who play the horn, the fife--the drum, some say!  We\r\nmay yet be Merrie England again, with our nobles taking the lead.\r\n\r\nEngland's nobles as a musical band at the head of a marching and dancing\r\npopulation, pictured happily an old Conservative country, that retained\r\nits members of aristocracy in the foremost places while subjecting them\r\nto downright uses.  Their ancestors, beholding them there, would be\r\nsatisfied on the point of honour; perhaps enlivened by hearing them at\r\nfife and drum.\r\n\r\nBut middle-class pedestrians, having paid five shillings for a ticket to\r\nhear the music they love, and not having full assurance of refreshment,\r\nare often, latterly, satirical upon their superiors; and, over this\r\ncountry at least, require the refreshment, that the democratic sprouts in\r\nthem may be reconciled with aristocracy.  Do not listen to them further\r\non the subject.  They vote safely enough when the day comes, if there is\r\nno praetematurally strong pull the other way.\r\n\r\nThey perceive the name of the Hon. Dudley Sowerby, fourth down the\r\nConcert-bill; marked for a flute-duet with Mr. Victor Radnor, Miss Nesta\r\nVictoria Radnor accompanying at the piano.  It may mean?  .  .  .  do you\r\nwant a whisper to suggest to you what it may mean?  The father's wealth\r\nis enormous; the mother is a beautiful majestic woman in her prime.  And\r\nsee, she sings: a wonderful voice.  And lower down, a duet with her\r\ndaughter: violins and clarionet; how funny; something Hungarian.  And in\r\nthe Second Part, Schubert's Ave Maria--Oh! when we hear that, we\r\ndissolve.  She was a singer before he married her, they say: a lady by\r\nbirth one of the first County families.  But it was a gift, and she could\r\nnot be kept from it, and was going, when they met--and it was love! the\r\nmost perfect duet.  For him she abandoned the Stage.  You must remember,\r\nthat in their young days the Stage was many stages beneath the esteem\r\nentertained for it now.  Domestic Concerts are got up to gratify her: a\r\nMiss Fredericks: good old English name.  Mr. Radnor calls his daughter,\r\nFreddy; so Mr. Taplow, the architect, says.  They are for modern music\r\nand ancient.  Tannhauser, Wagner, you see.  Pergolese.\r\n\r\nFlute-duet, Mercadante.  Here we have him!  O--Durandarte: Air Basque,\r\nvariations--his own.  Again, Senor Durandarte, Mendelssohn.  Encore him,\r\nand he plays you a national piece.  A dark little creature a Life-\r\nguardsman could hold-up on his outstretched hand for the fifteen minutes\r\nof the performance; but he fills the hall and thrills the heart, wafts\r\nyou to heaven; and does it as though he were conversing with his\r\nAndalusian lady-love in easy whispers about their mutual passion for\r\nSpanish chocolate all the while: so the musical critic of the Tirra-Lirra\r\nsays.  Express trains every half hour from London; all the big people of\r\nthe city.  Mr. Radnor commands them, like Royalty.  Totally different\r\nfrom that old figure of the wealthy City merchant; young, vigorous,\r\nelegant, a man of taste, highest culture, speaks the languages of Europe,\r\npatron of the Arts, a perfect gentleman.  His mother was one of the\r\nMontgomerys, Mr. Taplow says.\r\n\r\nAnd it was General Radnor, a most distinguished officer, dying knighted.\r\nBut Mr. Victor Radnor would not take less than a Barony--and then only\r\nwith descent of title to his daughter, in her own right.\r\n\r\nMr. Taplow had said as much as Victor Radnor chose that he should say.\r\n\r\nCarriages were in flow for an hour: pedestrians formed a wavy coil.\r\nJudgeing by numbers, the entertainment was a success; would the hall\r\ncontain them?  Marvels were told of the hall.  Every ticket entered and\r\nwas enfolded; almost all had a seat.  Chivalry stood.  It is a breeched\r\nabstraction, sacrificeing voluntarily and genially to the Fair, for a\r\nrestoring of the balance between the sexes, that the division of good\r\nthings be rather in the fair ones' favour, as they are to think: with the\r\nwarning to them, that the establishment of their claim for equality puts\r\nan end to the priceless privileges of petticoats.  Women must be mad, to\r\nprovoke such a warning; and the majority of them submissively show their\r\ngood sense.  They send up an incense of perfumery, all the bouquets of\r\nthe chemist commingled; most nourishing to the idea of woman in the nose\r\nof man.  They are a forest foliage--rustle of silks and muslins, magic\r\ninterweaving, or the mythology, if you prefer it.  See, hear, smell, they\r\nare Juno, Venus, Hebe, to you.  We must have poetry with them; otherwise\r\nthey are better in the kitchen.  Is there--but there is not; there is not\r\npresent one of the chivalrous breeched who could prefer the shocking\r\nemancipated gristly female, which imposes propriety on our sensations and\r\ninner dreams, by petrifying in the tender bud of them.\r\n\r\nColonel Corfe is the man to hear on such a theme.  He is a colonel of\r\nCompanies.  But those are his diversion, as the British Army has been to\r\nthe warrior.  Puellis idoneus, he is professedly a lady's man, a rose-\r\nbeetle, and a fine specimen of a common kind: and he has been that thing,\r\nthat shining delight of the lap of ladies, for a spell of years,\r\nnecessitating a certain sparkle of the saccharine crystals preserving\r\nhim, to conceal the muster.  He has to be fascinating, or he would look\r\noutworn, forlorn.  On one side of him is Lady Carmine; on the other, Lady\r\nSwanage; dames embedded in the blooming maturity of England's\r\nconservatory.  Their lords (an Earl, a Baron) are of the lords who go\r\ndown to the City to sow a title for a repair of their poor incomes, and\r\nare to be commended for frankly accepting the new dispensation while they\r\nretain the many advantages of the uncancelled ancient.  Thus gently does\r\na maternal Old England let them down.  Projectors of Companies,\r\nDirectors, Founders; Railway magnates, actual kings and nobles (though\r\none cannot yet persuade old reverence to do homage with the ancestral\r\nspontaneity to the uncrowned, uncoroneted, people of our sphere); holders\r\nof Shares in gold mines, Shares in Afric's blue mud of the glittering\r\nteeth we draw for English beauty to wear in the ear, on the neck, at the\r\nwrist; Bankers and wives of Bankers.  Victor passed among them, chatting\r\nright and left.\r\n\r\nLady Carmine asked him: 'Is Durandarte counted on?'\r\n\r\nHe answered: 'I made sure of the Luciani.'\r\n\r\nShe serenely understood.  Artistes are licenced people, with a Bohemian\r\ninstead of the titular glitter for the bewildering of moralists; as paste\r\nwill pass for diamonds where the mirror is held up to Nature by bold\r\nsupernumeraries.\r\n\r\nHe wished to introduce Nesta.  His girl was on the raised orchestral\r\nflooring.  Nataly held her fast to a music-scroll.\r\n\r\nMr. Peridon, sad for the absence and cause of absence of Louise de\r\nSeilles,--summoned in the morning abruptly to Bourges, where her brother\r\nlay with his life endangered by an accident at Artillery practise,--\r\nMr. Peridon was generally conductor.  Victor was to lead the full force\r\nof amateurs in the brisk overture to Zampa.  He perceived a movement of\r\nNataly, Nesta, and Peridon.  'They have come,' he said; he jumped on the\r\norchestra boards and hastened to greet the Luciani with Durandarte in the\r\nretiring-room.\r\n\r\nHis departure raised the whisper that he would wield the baton.  An\r\nopinion was unuttered.  His name for the flute-duet with the Hon. Dudley\r\nSowerby had not provoked the reserve opinion; it seemed, on the whole, a\r\npretty thing in him to condescend to do: the sentiment he awakened was\r\nnot flustered by it.  But the act of leading, appeared as an official\r\nthing to do.  Our soufe of sentiment will be seen subsiding under a\r\nbreath, without a repressive word to send it down.  Sir Rodwell\r\nBlachington would have preferred Radnor's not leading or playing either.\r\nColonel Corfe and Mr. Caddis declined to consider such conduct English,\r\nin a man of station .  .  .  notwithstanding Royal Highnesses, who are at\r\nleast partly English: partly, we say, under our breath, remembering our\r\nold ideal of an English gentleman, in opposition to German tastes.  It is\r\ntrue, that the whole country is changeing, decomposing!\r\n\r\nThe colonel fished for Lady Carmine's view.  And Lady Swanage too?  Both\r\nof the distinguished ladies approved of Mr. Radnor's leading--for a\r\nleading off.  Women are pleased to see their favourite in the place of\r\nprominence--as long as Fortune swims him unbuffeted, or one should say,\r\nunbattered, up the mounting wave.  Besides these ladies had none of the\r\ncolonel's remainder of juvenile English sense of the manly, his\r\nadolescent's intolerance of the eccentric, suspicion and contempt of any\r\nsupposed affectation, which was not ostentatiously, stalkingly practised\r\nto subdue the sex.  And you cannot wield a baton without looking\r\naffected.  And at one of the Colonel's Clubs in town, only five years\r\nback, an English musical composer, who had not then made his money--now\r\nby the mystery of events knighted!--had been (he makes now fifteen\r\nthousand a year) black-balled.  'Fiddler?  no; can't admit a Fiddler to\r\nassociate on equal terms with gentlemen.'  Only five years back: and at\r\npresent we are having the Fiddler everywhere.\r\n\r\nA sprinkling of the minor ladies also would have been glad if Mr. Radnor\r\nhad kept himself somewhat more exclusive.  Dr. Schlesien heard remarks,\r\nupon which his weighty Teutonic mind sat crushingly.  Do these English\r\ncare one bit for music?--for anything finer than material stuffs?--what\r\nthat man Durance calls, 'their beef, their beer, and their pew in\r\neternity'?  His wrath at their babble and petty brabble doubted that they\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nBut they do.  Art has a hold of them.  They pay for it; and the thing\r\npurchased grapples.  It will get to their bosoms to breathe from them in\r\ntime: entirely overcoming the taste for feudalism, which still a little\r\nobjects to see their born gentleman acting as leader of musicians.  A\r\npeople of slow movement, developing tardily, their country is wanting in\r\nthe distincter features, from being always in the transitional state,\r\nlike certain sea-fish rolling head over-you know not head from tail.\r\nWithout the Welsh, Irish, Scot; in their composition, there would not be\r\nmuch of the yeasty ferment: but it should not be forgotten that Welsh,\r\nIrish, Scot, are now largely of their numbers; and the taste for\r\nelegance, and for spiritual utterance, for Song, nay, for Ideas, is there\r\namong them, though it does not everywhere cover a rocky surface to\r\nbewitch the eyes of aliens;--like Louise de Seilles and Dr. Schlesien,\r\nfor example; aliens having no hostile disposition toward the people they\r\nwere compelled to criticize; honourably granting, that this people has a\r\ngreat history.  Even such has the Lion, with Homer for the transcriber of\r\nhis deeds.  But the gentle aliens would image our emergence from wildness\r\nas the unsocial spectacle presented by the drear menagerie Lion, alone or\r\nmated; with hardly an animated moment save when the raw red joint is\r\nbeneath his paw, reminding him of the desert's pasture.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, where Strength is, there is hope:--it may be said more\r\ntruly than of the breath of Life; which is perhaps but the bucket of\r\nbreath, muddy with the sediment of the well: whereas we have in Strength\r\na hero, if a malefactor; whose muscles shall haul him up to the light he\r\nwill prove worthy of, when that divinity has shown him his uncleanness.\r\nAnd when Strength is not exercising, you are sure to see Satirists jump\r\non his back.  Dozens, foreign and domestic, are on the back of Old\r\nEngland; a tribute to our quality if at the same time an irritating\r\nscourge.  The domestic are in excess; and let us own that their view of\r\nthe potentate, as an apathetic beast of power, who will neither show the\r\npower nor woo the graces; pretending all the while to be eminently above\r\nthe beast, and posturing in an inefficient mimicry of the civilized,\r\nexcites to satire.  Colney Durance had his excuses.  He could point to\r\nthe chief creative minds of the country for generations, as beginning\r\ntheir survey genially, ending venomously, because of an exasperating\r\nunreason and scum in the bubble of the scenes, called social, around\r\nthem.  Viola under his chin, he gazed along the crowded hall, which was\r\nto him a rich national pudding of the sycophants, the hypocrites, the\r\nburlies, the idiots; dregs of the depths and froth of the surface; bowing\r\nto one, that they may scorn another; instituting a Charity, for their\r\npoorer fawning fellows to relieve their purses and assist them in\r\ntricking the world and their Maker: and so forth, a tiresome tirade: and\r\nas it was not on his lips, but in the stomach of the painful creature,\r\nlet him grind that hurdy-gurdy for himself.  His friend Victor set it\r\nstirring: Victor had here what he aimed at!\r\n\r\nHow Success derides Ambition!  And for this he imperilled the happiness\r\nof the worthy woman he loved!  Exposed her to our fen-fogs and foul\r\nsnakes--of whom one or more might be in the assembly now: all because of\r\nhis insane itch to be the bobbing cork on the wave of the minute!\r\nColney's rapid interjections condensed upon the habitual shrug at human\r\nfolly, just when Victor, fronting the glassy stare of Colonel Corfe,\r\ntapped to start his orchestra through the lively first bars of the\r\noverture to Zampa.\r\n\r\nWe soon perceive that the post Mr. Radnor fills he thoroughly fills,\r\nwhatever it may be.  Zampa takes horse from the opening.  We have no\r\namateur conductor riding ahead: violins, 'cellos, piano, wind-stops:\r\nPeridon, Catkin, Pempton, Yatt, Cormyn, Colney, Mrs. Cormyn, Dudley\r\nSowerby: they are spirited on, patted, subdued, muted, raised, rushed\r\nanew, away, held in hand, in both hands.  Not earnestness worn as a\r\ncloak, but issuing, we see; not simply a leader of musicians, a leader of\r\nmen.  The halo of the millionaire behind, assures us of a development in\r\nthe character of England's merchant princes.  The homage we pay him\r\nflatters us.  A delightful overture, masterfully executed; ended too\r\nsoon; except that the programme forbids the ordinary interpretation of\r\nprolonged applause.  Mr. Radnor is one of those who do everything\r\nconsummately.  And we have a monition within, that a course of spiritual\r\nenjoyment will rouse the call for bodily refreshment.  His genial nod and\r\nlaugh and word of commendation to his troop persuade us oddly, we know\r\nnot how, of provision to come.  At the door of the retiring-room, see,\r\nhe is congratulated by Luciani and Durandarte.  Miss Priscilla Graves is\r\nnow to sing a Schumann.  Down later, it is a duet with the Rev. Septimus\r\nBarmby.  We have nothing to be ashamed of in her, before an Italian\r\nOperatic singer!  Ices after the first part is over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nDARTREY FENELLAN\r\n\r\nHad Nataly and Nesta known who was outside helping Skepsey to play ball\r\nwith the boys, they would not have worked through their share of the\r\nperformance with so graceful a composure.  Even Simeon Fenellan was\r\nunaware that his half-brother Dartrey had landed in England.  Dartrey\r\nwent first to Victor's office, where he found Skepsey packing the day's\r\nletters and circulars into the bag for the delivery of them at Lakelands.\r\nThey sprang a chatter, and they missed the last of the express trains\r\nwhich did, not greatly signify, Skepsey said, 'as it was a Concert.'  To\r\nhear his hero talk, was the music for him; and he richly enjoyed the\r\npacing along the railway-platform.\r\n\r\nArrived on the grounds, they took opposite sides in a game of rounders,\r\nat that moment tossing heads or tails for innings.  These boys were\r\nslovenly players, and were made unhappy by Skepsey's fussy instructions\r\nto them in smartness.  They had a stupid way of feeding the stick, and\r\nthey ran sprawling; it concerned Great Britain for them to learn how to\r\nuse their legs.  It was pitiful for the country to see how lumpish her\r\nyounger children were.  Dartrey knew his little man and laughed, after\r\nwarning him that his English would want many lessons before they\r\nstomached the mixture of discipline and pleasure.  So it appeared: the\r\npride of the boys in themselves, their confidence, enjoyment of the game,\r\nwere all gone; and all were speedily out but Skepsey; who ran for the\r\nrounder, with his coat off, sharp as a porpoise, and would have got it,\r\nhe had it in his grasp, when, at the jump, just over the line of the\r\ngoal, a clever fling, if ever was, caught him a crack on that part of the\r\nhuman frame where sound is best achieved.  Then were these young lumps\r\ntransformed to limber, lither, merry fellows.  They rejoiced Skepsey's\r\nheart; they did everything better, ran and dodged and threw in a style to\r\nwin the nod from the future official inspector of Games and Amusements of\r\nthe common people; a deputy of the Government, proposed by Skepsey to his\r\nhero with a deferential eagerness.  Dartrey clapped him on the shoulder,\r\nsoftly laughing.\r\n\r\n'System--Mr. Durance is right--they must have system, if they are to\r\nappreciate a holiday,' Skepsey said; and he sent a wretched gaze around,\r\nat the justification of some of the lurid views of Mr. Durance, in signs\r\nof the holiday wasted;--impoverishing the country's manhood in a small\r\ndegree, it may be argued, but we ask, can the country afford it, while\r\nforeign nations are drilling their youth, teaching them to be ready to\r\nmove in squads or masses, like the fist of a pugilist.  Skepsey left it\r\nto his look to speak his thought.  He saw an enemy in tobacco.  The\r\ndrowsiness of beer had stretched various hulks under trees.  Ponderous\r\ncricket lumbered half-alive.  Flabby fun knocked-up a yell.  And it was\r\nrather vexatious to see girls dancing in good time to the band-music.\r\nOne had a male-partner, who hopped his loutish burlesque of the thing he\r\ncould not do.\r\n\r\nApparently, too certainly, none but the girls had a notion of orderly\r\nmuscular exercise.  Of what use are girls!  Girls have their one mission\r\non earth; and let them be healthy by all means, for the sake of it; only,\r\nthey should not seem to prove that old England is better represented on\r\nthe female side.  Skepsey heard, with a nip of spite at his bosom, a\r\nsmall body of them singing in chorus as they walked in step, arm in arm,\r\nactually marched: and to the rearward, none of these girls heeding; there\r\nwere the louts at their burlesque of jigs and fisticuffs!  'Cherry Ripe,'\r\nwas the song.\r\n\r\n'It's delightful to hear them!' said Dartrey.\r\n\r\nSkepsey muttered jealously of their having been trained.\r\n\r\nThe song, which drew Dartrey Fenellan to the quick of an English home,\r\nplanted him at the same time in Africa to hear it.  Dewy on a parched\r\nforehead it fell, England the shedding heaven.\r\n\r\nHe fetched a deep breath, as of gratitude for vital refreshment.  He had\r\nhis thoughts upon the training of our English to be something besides the\r\nmachinery of capitalists, and upon the country as a blessed mother\r\ninstead of the most capricious of maudlin step-dames.\r\n\r\nHe flicked his leg with the stick he carried, said: 'Your master's the\r\nman to make a change among them, old friend!' and strolled along to a\r\ngroup surrounding two fellows who shammed a bout at single-stick.\r\nVacuity in the attack on either side, contributed to the joint success of\r\nthe defense.  They paused under inspection; and Dartrey said: 'You're\r\nburning to give them a lesson, Skepsey.'\r\n\r\nSkepsey had no objection to his hero's doing so, though at his personal\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nThe sticks were handed to them; the crowd increased; their rounders boys\r\nhad spied them, and came trooping to the scene.  Skepsey was directed to\r\nhit in earnest.  His defensive attitude flashed, and he was at head and\r\nright and left leg, and giving point, recovering, thrusting madly, and\r\nagain at shoulder and thigh, with bravos for reward of a man meaning\r\nbusiness; until a topper on his hat, a cut over the right thigh, and the\r\nstick in his middlerib, told the spectators of a scientific adversary;\r\nand loudly now the gentleman was cheered.  An undercurrent of warm\r\nfeeling ran for the plucky little one at it hot again in spite of the\r\nstrokes, and when he fetched his master a handsome thud across the\r\nshoulder, and the gentleman gave up and complimented him, Skepsey had\r\napplause.\r\n\r\nHe then begged his hero to put the previous couple in position, through\r\na few of the opening movements.  They were horribly sheepish at first.\r\nMeantime two boys had got hold of sticks, and both had gone to work in\r\nSkepsey's gallant style; and soon one was howling.  He excused himself,\r\nbecause of the funny-bone, situated, in his case, higher than usual up\r\nthe arm.  And now the pair of men were giving and taking cuts to make a\r\nrhinoceros caper.\r\n\r\n'Very well; begin that way; try what you can bear,' said Dartrey.\r\n\r\nSkepsey watched them, in felicity for love of the fray, pained by the\r\ndisregard of science.\r\n\r\nComments on the pretty play, indicating a reminiscent acquaintance with\r\nit, and the capacity for critical observations, were started.  Assaults,\r\nwonderful tricks of a slashing Life-Guardsman, one spectator had\r\nwitnessed at an exhibition in a London hall.  Boxing too.  You may see\r\ndisplays of boxing still in places.  How about a prizefight?--With money\r\non it?--Eh, but you don't expect men to stand up to be knocked into\r\nrumpsteaks for nothing?--No, but it's they there bets!--Right, and that's\r\na game gone to ruin along of outsiders.--But it always was and it always\r\nwill be popular with Englishmen!\r\n\r\nGreat English names of young days, before the wintry shadow of the Law\r\nhad blighted them, received their withered laurels.  Emulous boys were\r\nin the heroic posture.  Good! sparring does no hurt: Skepsey seized a\r\nlikely lad, Dartrey another.  Nature created the Ring for them.  Now\r\nthen, arms and head well up, chest hearty, shoulders down, out with the\r\nright fist, just below the level of the chin; out with the left fist\r\nfarther, right out, except for that bit of curve; so, and draw it\r\nslightly back for wary-pussy at the spring.  Firm you stand, feeling\r\nthe muscles of both legs, left half a pace ahead, right planted, both\r\nstringy.  None of your milk-pail looks; show us jaw, you bulldogs.  Now\r\nthen, left from the shoulder, straight at right of head.--Good, and\r\nalacrity called on vigour in Skepsey's pupil; Dartrey's had the fist on\r\nhis mouth before he could parry right arm up.  'Foul blow!' Dartrey\r\ncried.  Skepsey vowed to the contrary.  Dartrey reiterated his charge.\r\nSkepsey was a figure of negation, gesticulating and protesting.  Dartrey\r\nappealed tempestuously to the Ring; Skepsey likewise, in a tone of\r\ninjury.  He addressed a remonstrance to Captain Dartrey.\r\n\r\n'Hang your captain, sir!  I call you a coward; come on,' said the\r\nresolute gentleman, already in ripe form for the attack.  His blue eyes\r\nwere like the springing sunrise over ridges of the seas; and Skepsey\r\njumped to his meaning.\r\n\r\nBoys and men were spectators of a real scientific set-to, a lovely show.\r\nThey were half puzzled, it seemed so deadly.  And the little one got in\r\nhis blows at the gentleman, who had to be hopping.  Only, the worse the\r\ngentleman caught it, the friendlier his countenance became.  That was the\r\nwonder, and that gave them the key.  But it was deliciously near to the\r\nreal thing.\r\n\r\nDartrey and Skepsey shook hands.\r\n\r\n'And now, you fellows, you're to know, that this is one of the champions;\r\nand you take your lesson from him and thank him,' Dartrey said, as he\r\nturned on his heel to strike and greet the flow from the house.\r\n\r\n'Dartrey come!'  Victor, Fenellan, Colney, had him by the hand in turn.\r\nPure sweetness of suddenly awakened joy sat in Nataly's eyes as she swam\r\nto welcome him, Nesta moved a step, seemed hesitating, and she tripped\r\nforward.  'Dear Captain Dartrey!'\r\n\r\nHe did not say: 'But what a change in you!'\r\n\r\n'It is blue-butterfly, all the same,' Nataly spoke to his look.\r\n\r\nVictor hurriedly pronounced the formal introduction between the Hon.\r\nDudley Sowerby and Captain Dartrey Fenellan.  The bronze face and the\r\nmilky bowed to one another ceremoniously; the latter faintly flushing.\r\n\r\n'So here you are at last,' Victor said.  'You stay with us.'\r\n\r\n'To-morrow or later, if you'll have me.  I go down to my people to-\r\nnight.'\r\n\r\n'But you stay in England now?'  Nataly's voice wavered on the question.\r\n\r\n'There's a chance of my being off to Upper Burmah before the week's\r\nended.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, dear, dear!' sighed Fenellan; 'and out of good comes evil!--as\r\ngrandfather Deucalion exclaimed, when he gallantly handed up his dripping\r\nwife from the mud of the Deluge waters.  Do you mean to be running and\r\nDewing it on for ever, with only a nod for friends, Dart?'\r\n\r\n'Lord, Simmy, what a sound of home there is in your old nonsense!'\r\nDartrey said.\r\n\r\nHis eyes of strong dark blue colour and the foreign swarthiness of his\r\nbrows and cheeks and neck mixed the familiar and the strange, in the\r\nsight of the women who knew him.\r\n\r\nThe bill-broker's fair-tressed young wife whispered of curiosity\r\nconcerning him to Nataly.  He dressed like a sailor, he stood like a\r\nsoldier: and was he married?  Yes, he was married.\r\n\r\nMrs. Blathenoy imagined a something in Mrs. Radnor's tone.  She could\r\naccount for it; not by the ordinary reading of the feminine in the\r\nfeminine, but through a husband who professed to know secrets.  She was\r\nyoung in years and experience, ten months wedded, disappointedly\r\nawakened, enlivened by the hour, kindled by a novel figure of man,\r\nfretful for a dash of imprudence.  This Mrs. Radnor should be the one\r\nto second her very innocent turn for a galopade; her own position allowed\r\nof any little diverting jig or reel, or plunge in a bath--she required\r\nit, for the domestic Jacob Blathenoy was a dry chip: proved such, without\r\na day's variation during the whole of the ten wedded months.  Nataly\r\ngratified her spoken wish.  Dartrey Fenellan bowed to the lady, and she\r\nwithdrew him, seeing composedly that other and greater ladies had the\r\nwish ungratified.  Their husbands were not so rich as hers, and their\r\ncomplexions would hardly have pleased the handsome brown-faced officer so\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nBanquet, equal to a blast of trumpet, was the detaining word for the\r\nmultitude.  It circulated, one knows not how.  Eloquent as the whiffs to\r\nthe sniffs (and nowhere is eloquence to match it, when the latter are\r\nsharpened from within to without), the word was very soon over the field.\r\nMr. Carling may have helped; he had it from Fenellan; and he was among\r\nthe principal groups, claiming or making acquaintances, as a lawyer\r\nshould do.  The Concert was complimentarily a topic: Durandarte divine!--\r\ndid not everybody think so?  Everybody did, in default of a term for\r\novertopping it.  Our language is poor at hyperbole; our voices are\r\nstronger.  Gestures and heaven-sent eyeballs invoke to display the\r\nineffable.  Where was Durandarte now?  Gone; already gone; off with the\r\nLuciani for evening engagements; he came simply to oblige his dear friend\r\nMr. Radnor.  Cheque fifty guineas: hardly more on both sides than an\r\nexchange of smiles.  Ah, these merchant-princes!  What of Mr. Radnor's\r\namateur instrumentalists?  Amateurs, they are not to be named: perfect\r\nmusicians.  Mr. Radnor is the perfection of a host.  Yes, yes; Mrs.\r\nRadnor; Miss Radnor too: delicious voices; but what is it about Mr.\r\nRadnor so captivating!  He is not quite English, yet he is not at all\r\nforeign.  Is he very adventurous in business, as they say?\r\n\r\n'Soundest head in the City of London,' Mr. Blathenoy remarked.\r\n\r\nSir Rodwell Blachington gave his nod.\r\n\r\nThe crowd interjected, half-sighing.  We ought to be proud of such a man!\r\nPerhaps we are a trifle exaggerating, says its heart.  But that we are\r\nwholly grateful to him, is a distinct conclusion.  And he may be one of\r\nthe great men of his time: he has a quite individual style of dress.\r\n\r\nLady Rodwell Blachington observed to Colney Durance:\r\n\r\n'Mr. Radnor bids fair to become the idol of the English people.'\r\n\r\n'If he can prove himself to be sufficiently the dupe of the English\r\npeople,' said Colney.\r\n\r\n'Idol--dupe?' interjected Sir Rodwell, and his eyebrows fixed at the\r\nperch of Colney's famous 'national interrogation' over vacancy of\r\nunderstanding, as if from the pull of a string.  He had his audience with\r\nhim; and the satirist had nothing but his inner gush of acids at sight of\r\na planted barb.\r\n\r\nColney was asked to explain.  He never explained.  He performed a series\r\nof astonishing leaps, like the branchy baboon above the traveller's head\r\nin the tropical forest, and led them into the trap they assisted him to\r\nprepare for them.  'No humour, do you say?  The English have no humour?'\r\na nephew of Lady Blachington's inquired of him, with polite pugnacity,\r\nand was cordially assured, that 'he vindicated them.'\r\n\r\n'And Altruistic!  another specimen of the modern coinage,' a classical\r\nChurch dignitary, in grammarian disgust, remarked to a lady, as they\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nColney pricked-up his ears.  It struck him that he might fish for\r\nsuggestions in aid of the Grand Argument before the Elders of the Court\r\nof Japan.  Dr. Wardan, whose recognition he could claim, stated to him,\r\nthat the lady and he were enumerating words of a doubtfully legitimate\r\nquality now being inflicted upon the language.\r\n\r\n'The slang from below is perhaps preferable?' said Colney.\r\n\r\n'As little-less.'\r\n\r\n'But a pirate-tongue, cut-off from its roots, must continue to practise\r\npiracy, surely, or else take reinforcements in slang, otherwise it is\r\ninexpressive of new ideas.'\r\n\r\n'Possibly the new ideas are best expressed in slang.'\r\n\r\n'If insular.  They will consequently be incommunicable to foreigners.\r\nYou would, then, have us be trading with tokens instead of a precious\r\ncurrency?  Yet I cannot perceive the advantage of letting our ideas be\r\nclothed so racy of the obscener soil; considering the pretensions of the\r\nEnglish language to become the universal.  If we refuse additions from\r\nabove, they force themselves on us from below.'\r\n\r\nDr. Wardan liked the frame of the observations, disliked the substance.\r\n\r\n'One is to understand that the English language has these pretensions?'\r\nhe said:--he minced in his manner, after the well-known mortar-board and\r\ntassel type; the mouthing of a petrifaction: clearly useless to the\r\npleadings of the patriotic Dr. Bouthoin and his curate.\r\n\r\nHe gave no grip to Colney, who groaned at cheap Donnish sarcasm, and let\r\nhim go, after dealing him a hard pellet or two in a cracker-covering.\r\n\r\nThere was Victor all over the field netting his ephemerae!  And he who\r\nfeeds on them, to pay a price for their congratulations and flatteries,\r\nhe is one of them himself!\r\n\r\nNesta came tripping from the Rev. Septimus Barmby.  'Dear Mr. Durance,\r\nwhere is Captain Dartrey?'\r\n\r\nMrs. Blathenoy had just conducted her husband through a crowd, for an\r\nintroduction of him to Captain Dartrey.  That was perceptible.\r\n\r\nDudley Sowerby followed Nesta closely: he struck across the path of the\r\nRev. Septimus: again he had the hollow of her ear at his disposal.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Radnor was excellent.  He does everything consummately: really, we\r\nare all sensible of it.  I am.  He must lead us in a symphony.  These\r\nlight \"champagne overtures\" of French composers, as Mr. Fenellan calls\r\nthem, do not bring out his whole ability:--Zampa, Le Pre aux clercs,\r\nMasaniello, and the like.'\r\n\r\n'Your duet together went well.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks to you--to you.  You kept us together.'\r\n\r\n'Papa was the runaway or strain-the-leash, if there was one.'\r\n\r\n'He is impetuous, he is so fervent.  But, Miss Radnor, I could not be the\r\nrunaway-with you .  .  .  with you at the piano.  Indeed, I .  .  .\r\nshall we stroll down?  I love the lake.'\r\n\r\n'You will hear the bell for your cold dinner very soon.'\r\n\r\n'I am not hungry.  I would so much rather talk--hear you.  But you are\r\nhungry?  You have been singing twice: three times!  Opera singers, they\r\nsay, eat hot suppers; they drink stout.  And I never heard your voice\r\nmore effective.  Yours is a voice that .  .  .  something of the feeling\r\none has in hearing cathedral voices: carry one up.  I remember, in\r\nDresden, once, a Fraulein Kuhnstreich, a prodigy, very young, considering\r\nher accomplishments.  But it was not the same.'\r\n\r\nNesta wondered at Dartrey Fenellan for staying so long with Mr. and Mrs.\r\nBlathenoy.\r\n\r\n'Ah, Mr. Sowerby, if I am to have flattery, I cannot take it as a\r\nmilliner's dumb figure wears the beautiful dress; I must point out my\r\nview of some of my merits.'\r\n\r\n'Oh!  do, I beg, Miss .  .  .  You have a Christian name and I too: and\r\nonce .  .  .  not Mr. Sowerby: yes, it was Dudley!,\r\n\r\n'Quite accidentally, and a world of pardons entreated.'\r\n\r\n'And Dudley begged Dudley might be Dudley always !'\r\n\r\nHe was deepening to the Barmby intonation--apparently Cupid's; but a\r\nshade more airily Pagan, not so fearfully clerical.\r\n\r\nHer father had withdrawn Dartrey Fenellan from Mr. and Mrs. Blathenoy.\r\nDr. Schlesien was bowing with Dartrey.\r\n\r\n'And if Durandarte would only--but you are one with Miss Graves to\r\ndepreciate my Durandarte, in favour of the more classical Jachimo; whom\r\nwe all admire; but you shall be just,' said she, and she pouted.  She had\r\nseen her father plant Dartrey Fenellan in the midst of a group of City\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\nSimeon touched among them to pluck at his brother.  He had not a chance;\r\nhe retired, and swam into the salmon-net of seductive Mrs. Blathenoy's\r\nbroad bright smile.\r\n\r\n'It's a matter of mines, and they're hovering in the attitude of the\r\nquery, like corkscrews over a bottle, profoundly indifferent to blood-\r\nrelationships,' he said to her.\r\n\r\n'Pray, stay and be consoled by me,' said the fair young woman.  'You are\r\nto point me out all the distinguished people.  Is it true, that your\r\nbrother has left the army?'\r\n\r\n'Dartrey no longer wears the red.  Here comes Colonel Corfe, who does.\r\nEngland has her army still!'\r\n\r\n'His wife persuaded him?'\r\n\r\n'You see he is wearing the black.'\r\n\r\n'For her?  How very very sad!  Tell me--what a funnily dressed woman\r\nmeeting that gentleman!'\r\n\r\n'Hush--a friend of the warrior.  Splendid weather, Colonel Corfe.'\r\n\r\n'Superb toilettes!' The colonel eyed Mrs. Blathenoy dilatingly, advanced,\r\nbowed, and opened the siege.\r\n\r\nShe decided a calculation upon his age, made a wall of it, smilingly\r\nagreed with his encomium of the Concert, and toned her voice to\r\nFenellan's comprehension: 'Did it occur recently?'\r\n\r\n'Months; in Africa; I haven't the date.'\r\n\r\n'Such numbers of people one would wish to know!  Who are those ladies\r\nholding a Court, where Mr. Radnor is?'\r\n\r\n'Lady Carmine, Lady Swanage--if it is your wish?' interposed the colonel.\r\n\r\nShe dealt him a forgiving smile.  'And that pleasant-looking old\r\ngentleman?'\r\n\r\nColonel Corfe drew-up.  Fenellan said: 'Are we veterans at forty or so?'\r\n\r\n'Well, it 's the romance, perhaps!'  She raised her shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe colonel's intelligence ran a dog's nose for a lady's interjections.\r\n'The romance?  .  .  .  at forty, fifty?  gone?  Miss Julinks, the great\r\nheiress and a beauty; has chosen him over the heads of all the young men\r\nof his time.  Cranmer Lotsdale.  Most romantic history!'\r\n\r\n'She's in love with that, I suppose.'\r\n\r\n'Now you direct my attention to him,' said Fenellan, 'the writing of the\r\nromantic history has made the texture look a trifle thready.  You have a\r\nterrible eye.'\r\n\r\nIt was thrown to where the person stood who had first within a few\r\nminutes helped her to form critical estimates of men, more consciously to\r\nread them.\r\n\r\n'Your brother stays in England?'\r\n\r\n'The fear is, that he's off again.'\r\n\r\n'Annoying for you.  If I had a brother, I would not let him go.'\r\n\r\n'How would you detain him?'\r\n\r\n'Locks and bolts, clock wrong, hands and arms, kneeling--the fourth act\r\nof the Huguenots!'\r\n\r\n'He went by way of the window, I think.  But that was a lover.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! well!' she flushed.  She did not hear the 'neglected and astonished\r\ncolonel speak, and she sought diversion in saying to Fenellan: 'So many\r\npeople of distinction are assembled here to-day!  Tell me, who is that\r\npompous gentleman, who holds his arms up doubled, as he walks?'\r\n\r\n'Like flappers of a penguin: and advances in jerks: he is head of the\r\ngreat Firm of Quatley Brothers: Sir Abraham: finances or farms one of the\r\nSouth American Republics: we call him, Pride of Port.  He consumes it and\r\nhe presents it.'\r\n\r\n'And who is that little man, who stops everybody?'\r\n\r\n'People of distinction indeed!  That little man--is your upper lip\r\nunderrateing him?  .  .  .  When a lady's lip is erratically disdainful,\r\nit suggests a misuse of a copious treasury, deserving to be mulcted,\r\npunished--how?--who can say?--that little man, now that little man, with\r\na lift of his little finger, could convulse the Bacon Market!'\r\n\r\nMrs. Blathenoy shook.  Hearing Colonel Corfe exclaim:\r\n\r\n'Bacon Market!' she let fly a peal.  Then she turned to a fresh\r\nsatellite, a round and a ruddy, 'at her service ever,' Mr. Beaves\r\nUrmsing, and repeated Fenellan's words.  He, in unfeigned wonderment at\r\nsuch unsuspected powers, cried: 'Dear me!' and stared at the little man,\r\nmaking the pretty lady's face a twinkling dew.\r\n\r\nHe had missed the Concert.  Was it first-rate?  Ecstasy answered in the\r\nfemale voice.\r\n\r\n'Hem'd fool I am to keep appointments!' he muttered.\r\n\r\nShe reproved him: 'Fie, Mr. Urmsing; it's the making of them, not the\r\nkeeping!'\r\n\r\n'Ah, my dear ma'am, if I'd had Blathenoy's luck when he made a certain\r\nappointment.  And he was not so much older than me?  The old ones get the\r\nprizes!'\r\n\r\nMr. Beaves Urmsing prompted Colonel Corfe to laugh in triumph.  The\r\ncolonel's eyebrows were up in fixity over sleepy lids.  He brightened to\r\npropose the conducting of the pretty woman to the banquet.\r\n\r\n'We shall see them going in,' said she.  'Mr. Radnor has a French cook,\r\nwho does wonders.  But I heard him asking for Mr. Beaves Urmsing.  I'm\r\nsure he expected The Marigolds at his Concert.'\r\n\r\n'Anything to oblige the company,' said the rustic ready chorister,\r\nclearing his throat.\r\n\r\nThe lady's feet were bent in the direction of a grassy knoll, where\r\nsunflowers, tulips, dahlias, peonies, of the sex eclipsed at a distance\r\nits roses and lilies.  Fenellan saw Dartrey, still a centre of the\r\nmerchantmen, strolling thither.\r\n\r\n'And do you know, your brother is good enough to dine with us next week,\r\nThursday, down here,' she murmured.  'I could venture to command?--if you\r\nare not induced.'\r\n\r\n'Whichever word applies to a faithful subject.'\r\n\r\n'I do so wish your brother had not left the army!'\r\n\r\n'You have one son of Mars.'\r\n\r\nHer eyes took the colonel up to cast him down: he was not the antidote.\r\nShe said to him: 'Luciani's voice wears better than her figure.'\r\n\r\nThe colonel replied: 'I remember,' and corrected himself, 'at Eton, in\r\njackets: she was not so particularly slim; never knew how to dress.  You\r\nbeat Italians there!  She moved one as a youngster.'\r\n\r\n'Eton boys are so susceptible!'\r\n\r\n'Why, hulloa, don't I remember her coming out!--and do you mean to tell\r\nme,' Mr. Beaves Urmsing brutally addressed the colonel, 'that you were at\r\nEton when .  .  . why, what age do you give the poor woman, then!'\r\nHe bellowed, 'Eh?' as it were a bull crowing.\r\n\r\nThe colonel retreated to one of his defensive corners.  'I am not aware\r\nthat I meant to tell you anything.'\r\n\r\nMr. Beaves Urmsing turned square-breasted on Fenellan: 'Fellow's a born\r\ndonkey!'\r\n\r\n'And the mother lived?' said Fenellan.\r\n\r\nMr. Beaves Urmsing puffed with wrath at the fellow.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, in the midst of the group surrounding and\r\nfelicitating Victor, he had sight of Fenellan conversing with fair ones,\r\nand it struck a light in him; he went three steps backward, with shouts.\r\n'Dam funny fellow!  eh?  who is he?  I must have that man at my table.\r\nWorth fifty Colonel Jackasses!  And I 've got a son in the Guards: and as\r\nmuch laugh in him, he 's got, as a bladder.  But we'll make a party, eh,\r\nRadnor?  with that friend o' yours.  Dam funny fellow!  and precious\r\nlittle of it going on now among the young lot.  They're for seeing ghosts\r\nand gaping their jaws; all for the quavers instead of the capers.'\r\n\r\nHe sounded and thrummed his roguish fling-off for the capers.  A second\r\nglimpse of Fenellan agitated the anecdote, as he called it, seizing\r\nVictor's arm, to have him out of earshot of the ladies.  Delivery,\r\nnot without its throes, was accomplished, but imperfectly, owing to\r\nsympathetic convulsions, under which Mr. Beaves Urmsing's countenance was\r\ncrinkled of many colours, as we see the Spring rhubarb-leaf.  Unable to\r\nrepeat the brevity of Fenellan's rejoinder, he expatiated on it to convey\r\nit, swearing that it was the kind of thing done in the old days, when men\r\nwere witty dogs:--'pat! and pat back! as in the pantomime.'\r\n\r\n'Repartee !' said Victor.  'He has it.  You shall know him.  You're the\r\nman for him.'\r\n\r\n'He for me, that he is!--\"Hope the mother's doing well?  My card\":--eh?\r\nGrave as an owl!  Look, there goes the donkey, lady to right and left,\r\nall ears for him--ha!  ha!  I must have another turn with your friend.\r\n\"Mother lived, did she?\"  Dam funny fellow, all of the olden time!  And a\r\ndinner, bachelor dinner, six of us, at my place, next week, say\r\nWednesday, half-past six, for a long evening--flowing bowl--eh, shall it\r\nbe?'\r\n\r\nNesta came looking to find her Captain Dartrey.\r\n\r\nMr. Beaves Urmsing grew courtly of the olden time.  He spied Colonel\r\nCorfe anew, and 'Donkey!' rose to split the roar at his mouth, and full\r\nof his anecdote, he pursued some congenial acquaintances, crying to his\r\nhost: 'Wednesday, mind!  eh?  by George, your friend's gizzarded me for\r\nthe day!'\r\n\r\nPlumped with the rich red stream of life, this last of the squires of old\r\nEngland thumped along among the guests, a very tuning-fork to keep them\r\nat their pitch of enthusiasm.  He encountered Mr. Caddis, and it was an\r\nencounter.  Mr. Caddis represented his political opinions; but here was\r\nthis cur of a Caddis whineing his niminy note from his piminy nob, when\r\nhe was asked for his hearty echo of the praises of this jolly good fellow\r\ncome to waken the neighbourhood, to be a blessing, a blazing hearth, a\r\nfall of manna:--and thank the Lord for him, you desertdog!  'He 's a\r\nmerchant prince, and he's a prince of a man, if you're for titles.  Eh?\r\nyou \"assent to my encomiums.\"  You'll be calling me Mr. Speaker next.\r\nHang me, Caddis, if those Parliamentary benches of yours aren't freezing\r\nyou from your seat up, and have got to your jaw--my belief!'\r\n\r\nMr. Caddis was left reflecting, that we have, in the dispensations of\r\nProvidence, when we have a seat, to submit to castigations from butcherly\r\nmen unaccountably commissioned to solidify the seat.  He could have\r\npreached a discourse upon Success, to quiet the discontentment of the\r\nunseated.  And our world of seats oddly gained, quaintly occupied,\r\nmaliciously beset, insensately envied, needs the discourse.  But it was\r\nnot delivered, else would it have been here written down without mercy,\r\nas a medical prescript, one of the grand specifics.  He met Victor, and,\r\nbetween his dread of him and the counsels of a position subject to\r\nstripes, he was a genial thaw.  Victor beamed; for Mr. Caddis had\r\npreviously stood eminent as an iceberg of the Lakelands' party.  Mr.\r\nInchling and Mr. Caddis were introduced.  The former in Commerce, the\r\nlatter in Politics, their sustaining boast was, the being our stable\r\nEnglishmen; and at once, with cousinly minds, they fell to chatting upon\r\nthe nothings agreeably and seriously.  Colney Durance forsook a set of\r\nladies for fatter prey, and listened to them.  What he said, Victor did\r\nnot hear.  The effect was always to be seen, with Inchling under Colney.\r\nFenellan did better service, really good service.\r\n\r\nNataly played the heroine she was at heart.  Why think of her as having\r\nto act a character!  Twice had Carling that afternoon, indirectly and\r\ndirectly, stated Mrs. Burman to be near the end we crape a natural, a\r\ndefensible, satisfaction to hear of:--not wishing it--poor woman!--but\r\npardonably, before man and all the angels, wishing, praying for the\r\nbeloved one to enter into her earthly peace by the agency of the other's\r\nexit into her heavenly.\r\n\r\nFenellan and Colney came together, and said a word apiece of their\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n'In his element!  The dear old boy has the look of a goldfish, king of\r\nhis globe.'\r\n\r\n'The dear old boy has to me the look of a pot on the fire, with a loose\r\nlid.'\r\n\r\nI may have the summons from Themison to-morrow, Victor thought.  The\r\nsuccess of the day, was a wine that rocked the soberest of thoughts.\r\nFor, strange to confess, ever since the fall on London Bridge, his heart,\r\ninfluenced in some degree by Nataly's depression perhaps, had been\r\nshadowed by doubts of his infallible instinct for success.  Here, at a\r\nstroke, and before entering the house, he had the whole neighbourhood\r\nabout him: he could feel that he and Nataly stood in the minds of the\r\nworthy people variously with the brightness if not with the warmth\r\ndistinguishable in the bosom of Beaves Urmsing--the idea of whom gave\r\nLakelands an immediate hearth-glow.\r\n\r\nArmandine was thirteen minutes, by his watch, behind the time she had\r\nnamed.  Small blame to her.  He excused her to Lady Carmine, Lady\r\nSwanage, Lady Blachington, Mrs. Fanning, Sir Abraham Quatley, Mr. Danny\r\n(of Bacon fame) and the rest of the group surrounding Nataly on the mound\r\nleftward of the white terraces descending to the lake; where she stood\r\nbeating her foot fretfully at the word brought by Nesta, that Dartrey\r\nFenellan had departed.  It was her sunshine departed.  But she went\r\nthrough her task of conversing amiably.  Colney, for a wonder, consented\r\nto be useful in assisting Fenellan to relate stories of French Cooks;\r\nwhich were, like the Royal Hanoverian oyster, of an age for offering\r\nacceptable flavour to English hearers.  Nesta drew her mother's attention\r\nto Priscilla Graves and Skepsey; the latter bending head and assenting.\r\nNataly spoke of the charm of Priscilla's voice that day, in her duet with\r\nthe Rev. Septimus.  Mr. Pempton looked; he saw that Priscilla was\r\nproselytizing.  She was perfection to him but for one blotting thing.\r\nWith grief on his eyelids, he said to Nataly or to himself: 'Meat!'\r\n\r\n'Dear friend, don't ride your hobby over us,' she replied.\r\n\r\n'But it's with that object they mount it,' said Victor.\r\n\r\nThe greater ladies of the assembly were quite ready to accuse the\r\nsections, down to the individuals, of the social English (reserving our\r\nelect) of an itch to be tyrants.\r\n\r\nColney was apologizing for them, with his lash: 'It's merely the sensible\r\neffect of a want of polish of the surface when they rub together.'\r\n\r\nAnd he heard Carling exclaim to Victor: 'How comes the fellow here!'\r\n\r\nSkepsey had rushed across an open space to intercept a leisurely\r\nprogressive man, whose hat was of the shape Victor knew; and the man wore\r\nthe known black gaiters.  In appearance, he had the likeness of a fallen\r\nparson.\r\n\r\nCarling and Victor crossed looks that were questions carrying their\r\nanswers.\r\n\r\nNataly's eyes followed Victor's.  'Who is the man?' she said; and she got\r\nno reply beyond a perky sparkle in his gaze.\r\n\r\nOthers were noticing the man, who was trying to pass by Skepsey, now on\r\nhis right side, now on his left.\r\n\r\n'There'll be no stopping him,' Carling said, and he slipped to the rear.'\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, Armandine's mellow bell proclaimed her readiness.\r\n\r\nVictor rubbed the back of his head.  Nataly asked him: 'Dear, is it that\r\nman?'\r\n\r\nHe nodded scantly: 'Expected, expected.  I think we have our summons from\r\nArmandine.  One moment--poor soul! poor soul! Lady Carmine--Sir Abraham\r\nQuatley.  Will you lead?  Lady Blachington, I secure you.  One moment.'\r\n\r\nHe directed Nataly to pair a few of the guests; he hurried down the slope\r\nof sward.\r\n\r\nNataly applied to Colney Durance.  'Do you know the man?--is it that\r\nman?'\r\n\r\nColney rejoined: 'The man's name is Jarniman.'\r\n\r\nArmandine's bell swung melodiously.  The guests had grouped, thickening\r\nfor the stream to procession.  Mrs. Blathenoy claimed Fenellan; she\r\nrequested him to tell her whether he had known Mrs. Victor Radnor many\r\nyears.  She mused.  'You like her?'\r\n\r\n'One likes one's dearest of friends among women, does one not?'\r\n\r\nThe lady nodded to his response.  'And your brother?'\r\n\r\n'Dartrey is devoted to her.'\r\n\r\n'I am sure,' said she, 'your brother is a chivalrous gentleman.  I like\r\nher too.'  She came to her sentiment through the sentiment of the\r\nchivalrous gentleman.  Sinking from it, she remarked that Mr. Radnor was\r\nhandsome still.  Fenellan commended the subject to her, as one to\r\ndiscourse of when she met Dartrey.  A smell of a trap-hatch, half-open,\r\nafflicted and sharpened him.  It was Blathenoy's breath: husbands of\r\nyoung wives do these villanies, for the sake of showing their knowledge.\r\nFenellan forbore to praise Mrs. Victor: he laid his colours on Dartrey.\r\nThe lady gave ear till she reddened.  He meant no harm, meant nothing but\r\ngood; and he was lighting the most destructive of our lower fires.\r\n\r\nVisibly, that man Jarniman was disposed of with ease.  As in the street-\r\ntheatres of crowing Punch, distance enlisted pantomime to do the\r\neffective part of the speeches.  Jarniman's hat was off, he stood bent,\r\nhe delivered his message.  He was handed over to Skepsey's care for the\r\nreceiving of meat and drink.  Victor returned; he had Lady Blachington's\r\nhand on his arm; he was all hers, and in the heart of his company of\r\nguests at the same time.  Eyes that had read him closely for years, were\r\nunable to spell a definite signification on his face, below the\r\noverflowing happiness of the hospitable man among contented guests.  He\r\nhad in fact something within to enliven him; and that was the more than\r\nsuspicion, amounting to an odour of certainty, that Armandine intended\r\none of her grand surprises for her master, and for the hundred and fifty\r\nor so to be seated at her tables in the unwarmed house of Lakelands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nCONCERNS THE INTRUSION OF JARNIMAN\r\n\r\nArmandine did her wonders.  There is not in the wide range of the Muses a\r\nmore responsive instrument than man to his marvellous cook; and if his\r\nnotes were but as flowing as his pedals are zealous, we should be carried\r\non the tale of the enthusiasm she awakened, away from the rutted\r\nhighroad, where History now thinks of tightening her girdle for an\r\naccelerated pace.\r\n\r\nThe wonders were done: one hundred and seventy guests plenteously fed at\r\ntables across the great Concert Hall, down a length of the conservatory-\r\nglass, on soups, fish, meats, and the kitchen-garden, under play of\r\ncreative sauces, all in the persuasive steam of savouriness; every dish,\r\none may say, advancing, curtseying, swimming to be your partner, instead\r\nof passively submitting to the eye of appetite, consenting to the teeth,\r\nas that rather melancholy procession of the cold, resembling established\r\nspinsters thrice-corseted in decorum, will appear to do.  Whether\r\nArmandine had the thought or that she simply acted in conformity with\r\na Frenchwoman's direct good sense, we do require to smell a sort of\r\nanimation in the meats we consume.  We are still perhaps traceably\r\nrelated to the Adamite old-youngster just on his legs, who betrayed at\r\nevery turn his Darwinian beginnings, and relished a palpitating\r\nunwillingness in the thing refreshing him; only we young-oldsters cherish\r\nthe milder taste for willingness, with a throb of the vanquished in it.\r\nAnd a seeming of that we get from the warm roast.  The banquet to be\r\nfervently remembered, should smoke, should send out a breath to meet us.\r\nVictor's crowded saloon-carriage was one voice of eulogy, to raise\r\nArmandine high as the finale rockets bursting over Wrensham Station at\r\nthe start Londonward.  How had she managed?  We foolishly question the\r\narts of magicians.\r\n\r\nMr. Pempton was an apparent dissentient, as the man must be who is half a\r\ncentury ahead of his fellows in humaneness, and saddened by the display\r\nof slaughtered herds and their devourers.  He had picked out his\r\nvegetable and farinaceous morsels, wherever he could get them\r\nuncontaminated; enough for sustenance; and the utmost he could show was,\r\nthat he did not complain. When mounted and ridden by the satirist, in\r\nwrath at him for systematically feasting the pride of the martyr on the\r\nmaceration of his animal part, he put on his martyr's pride, which\r\nassumed a perfect contentment in the critical depreciation of opposing\r\nsystems: he was drawn to state, as he had often done, that he considered\r\nour animal part shamefully and dangerously over nourished, and that much\r\nof the immorality of the world was due to the present excessive\r\nindulgence in meats. 'Not in drink?' Miss Graves inquired.  'No,' he said\r\nboldly; 'not equally; meats are more insidious.  I say nothing of taking\r\nlife--of fattening for that express purpose: diseases of animals: bad\r\nblood made: cruelty superinduced: it will be seen to be, it will be\r\nlooked back on, as a form of, a second stage of, cannibalism.  Let that\r\npass.  I say, that for excess in drinking, the penalty is paid instantly,\r\nor at least on the morrow.'\r\n\r\n'Paid by the drunkard's wife, you should say.'\r\n\r\n'Whereas intemperance in eating, corrupts constitutionally, more\r\nspiritually vitiates, we think: on the whole, gluttony is the least-\r\ngenerous of the vices.'\r\n\r\nColney lured Mr. Pempton through a quagmire of the vices to declare,\r\nthat it brutalized; and stammeringly to adopt the suggestion, that our\r\nbreeding of English ladies--those lights of the civilized world--can\r\nhardly go with a feeding upon flesh of beasts.  Priscilla regretted that\r\nchampagne should have to be pleaded in excuse of impertinences to her\r\nsex.  They were both combative, nibbed for epigram, edged to inflict\r\nwounds; and they were set to shudder openly at one another's practises;\r\nthey might have exposed to Colney which of the two maniacal sections of\r\nhis English had the vaster conceit of superiority in purity; they were\r\nbaring themselves, as it were with a garment flung-off at each retort.\r\nHe reproached them for undermineing their countrymen; whose Falstaff\r\npanics demanded blood of animals to restore them; and their periods of\r\nbragging, that they should brandify their wits to imagine themselves\r\nVikings.\r\n\r\nNataly interposed.  She was vexed with him.  He let his eyelids drop: but\r\nthe occasion for showing the prickliness of the bristly social English,\r\ncould not be resisted.  Dr. Peter Yatt was tricked to confess, that small\r\nannoyances were, in his experience, powerful on the human frame; and Dr.\r\nJohn Cormyn was very neatly brought round to assure him he was mistaken\r\nif he supposed the homoeopathic doctor who smoked was exercising a\r\ndestructive influence on the efficacy of the infinitesimal doses he\r\nprescribed; Dr. Yatt chuckled a laugh at globules; Dr. Cormyn at patients\r\ntreated as horses; while Mr. Catkin was brought to praise the smoke of\r\ntobacco as our sanctuary from the sex; and Mr. Peridon quietly denied,\r\nthat the taking of it into his nostrils from the puffs of his friend\r\ncaused him sad silences: Nesta flew to protect the admirer of her beloved\r\nLouise.  Her subsiding young excitement of the day set her Boating on\r\nthat moony melancholy in Mr. Peridon.\r\n\r\nNo one could understand the grounds for Colney's more than usual\r\nwaspishness.  He trotted out the fulgent and tonal Church of the Rev.\r\nSeptimus; the skeleton of worship, so truly showing the spirit, in that\r\nof Dudley Sowerby's family; maliciously admiring both; and he had a spar\r\nwith Fenellan, ending in a snarl and a shout.  Victor said to him: 'Yes,\r\nhere, as much as you like, old Colney, but I tell you, you've staggered\r\nthat poor woman Lady Blachington to-day, and her husband too; and I don't\r\nknow how many besides.  What the pleasure of it can be, I can't guess.'\r\n\r\n'Nor I,' said Fenellan, 'but I'll own I feel envious; like the girl among\r\na family of boys I knew, who were all of them starved in their infancy by\r\na miserly father, that gave them barely a bit of Graves to eat and not a\r\ndrop of Pempton to drink; and on the afternoon of his funeral, I found\r\nthem in the drawing-room, four lank fellows, heels up, walking on their\r\nhands, from long practice; and the girl informed me, that her brothers\r\nwere able so to send the little blood they had in their bodies to their\r\nbrains, and always felt quite cheerful for it, happy, and empowered to\r\ndeal with the problems of the universe; as they couldn't on their legs;\r\nbut she, poor thing, was forbidden to do the same!  And I'm like her.  I\r\ncare for decorum too much to get the brain to act on Colney's behaviour;\r\nbut I see it enraptures him and may be comprehensible to the topsy-\r\nturvy.'\r\n\r\nVictor rubbed hands.  It was he who filled Colney's bag of satiric spite.\r\nIn addition to the downright lunacy of the courting of country society,\r\nby means of the cajolements witnessed this day, a suspicion that Victor\r\nwas wearing a false face over the signification--of Jarniman's visit and\r\nmeant to deceive the trustful and too-devoted loving woman he seemed\r\nbound to wreck, irritated the best of his nature.  He had a resolve to\r\npass an hour with the couple, and speak and insist on hearing plain words\r\nbefore the night had ended.  But Fenellan took it out of him.  Victor's\r\nshow of a perfect contentment emulating Pempton's, incited Colney to some\r\nof his cunning rapier-thrusts with his dancing adversary; and the heat\r\nwhich is planted in us for the composition: of those cool epigrams, will\r\nnot allow plain words to follow.  Or, handing him over to the police of\r\nthe Philistines, you may put it, that a habit of assorting spices will\r\nrender an earnest simplicity distasteful.  He was invited by Nataly to\r\ncome home with them; her wish for his presence, besides personal, was\r\nmoved by an intuition, that his counsel might specially benefit them.\r\nHe shrugged; he said he had work at his chambers.\r\n\r\n'Work!' Victor ejaculated: he never could reach to a right comprehension\r\nof labour, in regard to the very unremunerative occupation of literature.\r\nColney he did not want, and he let him go, as Nataly noticed, without a\r\nsign of the reluctance he showed when the others, including Fenellan,\r\nexcused themselves.\r\n\r\n'So! we're alone?' he said, when the door of the hall had closed on them.\r\nHe kept Nesta talking of the success of the day until she, observing her\r\nmother's look, simulated the setting-in of a frenzied yawn.  She was\r\nkissed, and she tripped to her bed.\r\n\r\n'Now we are alone,' Nataly said.\r\n\r\n'Well, dear, and the day was, you must own .  .  .  ' he sought to trifle\r\nwith her heavy voice; but she recalled him: 'Victor!' and the naked\r\nanguish in her cry of his name was like a foreign world threatening the\r\none he filled.\r\n\r\n'Ah, yes;  that man, that Jarniman.  You saw him, I remember.  You\r\nrecollected him?--stouter than he was.  In her service ever since.  Well,\r\na little drop of bitter, perhaps: no harm, tonic.'\r\n\r\n'Victor, is she very ill?'\r\n\r\n'My love, don't feel at your side: she is ill, ill, not the extreme case:\r\nnot yet: old and ill.  I told Skepsey to give the man refreshment: he had\r\nto do his errand.'\r\n\r\n'What?  why did he come?'\r\n\r\n'Curious; he made acquaintance with Skepsey, and appears to have\r\noutwitted poor Skepsey, as far as I see it.  But if that woman thinks of\r\nintimidating me now--!'  His eyes brightened; he had sprung from\r\nevasions.  'Living in flagrant sin, she says: you and I!  She will not\r\nhave it; warns me.  Heard this day at noon of company at Lakelands.\r\nJarniman off at once.  Are to live in obscurity;--you and I!  if\r\ntogether!  Dictates from her death-bed-I suppose her death-bed.'\r\n\r\n'Dearest,' Nataly pressed hand on her left breast, 'may we not think that\r\nshe may be right?'\r\n\r\n'An outrageous tyranny of a decrepit woman naming herself wife when she\r\nis only a limpet of vitality, with drugs for blood, hanging-on to blast\r\nthe healthy and vigorous!  I remember old Colney's once, in old days,\r\ncalling that kind of marriage a sarcophagus.  It was to me.  There I lay\r\n--see myself lying! wasting!  Think what you can good of her, by all\r\nmeans!  From her bed! despatches that Jarniman to me from her bedside,\r\nwith the word, that she cannot in her conscience allow--what imposition\r\nwas it I practised?  .  .  .  flagrant sin?--it would have been an\r\ninfinitely viler .  .  .  .  She is the cause of suffering enough: I bear\r\nno more from her; I've come to the limit.  She has heard of Lakelands:\r\nshe has taken one of her hatreds to the place.  She might have written,\r\nmight have sent me a gentleman, privately.  No: it must be done in\r\ndramatic style-for effect: her confidential--lawyer?--doctor?--butler!\r\nPerhaps to frighten me:--the boy she knew, and--poor soul!  I don't mean\r\nto abuse her: but such conduct as this is downright brutal.  I laugh at\r\nit, I snap my fingers.  I can afford to despise it.  Only I do say it\r\ndeserves to be called abominable.'\r\n\r\n'Victor, has she used a threat?'\r\n\r\n'Am I brought to listen to any of her threats!--Funny thing, I 'm certain\r\nthat woman never can think of me except as the boy she knew.  I saw her\r\nfirst when she was first a widow.  She would keep talking to me of the\r\nseductions of the metropolis--kept informing me I was a young man .  .  .\r\nshaking her head.  I 've told you.  She--well, I know we are mixtures,\r\nwomen as well as men.  I can, I hope, grant the same--I believe I can--\r\nallowances to women as to men; we are poor creatures, all of using one\r\nsense: though I won't give Colney his footing; there's a better way of\r\nreading us.  I hold fast to Nature.  No violation of Nature, my good\r\nColney!  We can live the lives of noble creatures; and I say that\r\nhappiness was meant for us:--just as, when you sit down to your dinner,\r\nyou must do it cheerfully, and you make good blood: otherwise all's\r\nwrong.  There's the right answer to Colney!  But when a woman like that\r\n.  .  .  .  and marries a boy: well, twenty-one--not quite that: and an\r\ninnocent, a positive innocent--it may seem incredible, after a term of\r\nschool-life: it was a fact: I can hardly understand it myself when I look\r\nback.  Marries him!  And then sets to work to persecute him, because he\r\nhas blood in his veins, because he worships beauty; because he seeks a\r\nreal marriage, a real mate.  And, I say it! let the world take its own\r\nview, the world is wrong! because he preferred a virtuous life to the\r\nkind of life she would, she must--why, necessarily!--have driven him\r\nto, with a mummy's grain of nature in his body.  And I am made of flesh,\r\nI admit it.'\r\n\r\n'Victor, dearest, her threat concerns only your living at Lakelands.'\r\n\r\n'Pray, don't speak excitedly, my love,' he replied to the woman whose\r\ntones had been subdued to scarce more than waver.  'You see how I meet\r\nit: water off a duck's back, or Indian solar beams on the skin of a\r\nHindoo!  I despise it hardly worth contempt;--But, come: our day was a\r\ngood one.  Fenellan worked well.  Old Colney was Colney Durance, of\r\ncourse.  He did no real mischief.'\r\n\r\n'And you will not determine to enter Lakelands--not yet, dear?' said\r\nNataly.\r\n\r\n'My own girl, leave it all to me.'\r\n\r\n'But, Victor, I must, must know.'\r\n\r\n'See the case.  You have lots of courage.  We can't withdraw.  Her\r\nintention is mischief.  I believe the woman keeps herself alive for it:\r\nwe've given her another lease!--though it can only be for a very short\r\ntime; Themison is precise; Carling too.  If we hold back--I have great\r\nfaith in Themison--the woman's breath on us is confirmed.  We go down,\r\nthen; complete the furnishing, quite leisurely; accept--listen--accept\r\none or two invitations: impossible to refuse!--but they are accepted!\r\n--and we defy her: a crazy old creature: imagines herself the wife of the\r\nex-Premier, widow of Prince Le Boo, engaged to the Chinese Ambassador, et\r\ncaetera.  Leave the tussle with that woman to me.  No, we don't repeat\r\nthe error of Crayc Farm and Creckholt.  And here we have stout friends.\r\nNot to speak of Beaver Urmsing: a picture of Old Christmas England!  You\r\ntook to him?--must have taken to Beaver Urmsing!  The Marigolds!  And Sir\r\nRodwell and Lady Blachington are altogether above the mark of Sir\r\nHumphrey and Lady Pottil, and those half and half Mountneys.  There's a\r\nwarm centre of home in Lakelands.  But I know my Nataly: she is thinking\r\nof our girl.  Here is the plan: we stand our ground: my dear soul won't\r\nforsake me only there's the thought of Fredi, in the event .  .  .\r\nimprobable enough.  I lift Fredi out of the atmosphere awhile; she goes\r\nto my cousins the Duvidney ladies.'\r\n\r\nNataly was hit by a shot.  'Can you imagine it, Victor?'\r\n\r\n'Regard it as done.'\r\n\r\n'They will surely decline!'\r\n\r\n'Their feeling for General Radnor is a worship.'\r\n\r\n'All the more .  .  . ?'\r\n\r\n'The son inherits it.  He goes to them personally.  Have you ever known\r\nme personally fail?  Fredi stays at Moorsedge for a month or two.\r\nDorothea and Virginia Duvidney will give her a taste of a new society;\r\ngood for the girl.  All these little shiftings can be turned to good.\r\nMeantime, I say, we stand our ground: but you are not to be worried; for\r\nthough we have gone too far to recede, we need not and we will not make\r\nthe entry into Lakelands until--you know: that is, auspiciously, to suit\r\nyou in every way.  Thus I provide to meet contingencies.  What one may\r\nreally fancy is, that the woman did but threaten.  There's her point of\r\nview to be considered: silly, crazy; but one sees it.  We are not sure\r\nthat she struck a blow at Craye or Creckholt.  I wonder she never wrote.\r\nShe was frightened, when she came to manage her property, of signing her\r\nname to anything.  Absurd, that sending of Jarniman!  However, it's her\r\nmove; we make a corresponding disposition of our chessmen.'\r\n\r\n'And I am to lose my Nesta for a month?' Nataly said, after catching here\r\nand there at the fitful gleams of truce or comfort dropped from his\r\nwords.  And simultaneously, the reproach of her mind to her nature for\r\nagain and so constantly yielding to the domination of his initiative:\r\nunable to find the words, even the ideas, to withstand him,--brought big\r\ntears.  Angry at herself both for the internal feebleness and the\r\nexhibition of it, she blinked and begged excuse.  There might be nothing\r\nthat should call her to resist him.  She could not do much worse than she\r\nhad done to-day.  The reflection, that to-day she had been actually\r\nsustained by the expectation of a death to come, diminished her estimate\r\nof to-morrow's burden on her endurance, in making her seem a less\r\ncriminal woman, who would have no such expectation: which was virtually\r\na stab at a fellow creature's future.  Her head was acute to work in the\r\ndirection of the casuistries and the sensational webs and films.  Facing\r\nVictor, it was a block.\r\n\r\nBut the thought came: how could she meet those people about Lakelands,\r\nwithout support of the recent guilty whispers!  She said coldly, her\r\nheart shaking her: 'You think there has been a recovery?'\r\n\r\n'Invalids are up and down.  They are--well, no; I should think she dreads\r\nthe .  .  .'  he kept 'surgeon' out of hearing.  'Or else she means this\r\nfor the final stroke: \"though I'm lying here, I can still make him feel.\"\r\nThat, or--poor woman--she has her notions of right and wrong.'\r\n\r\n'Could we not now travel for a few weeks, Victor?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly, dear; we will, after we have kept our engagements to dine--\r\nI accepted--with the Blathenoys, the Blachingtons, Beaver Urmsing.'\r\n\r\nNataly's vision of the peaceful lost little dairy cottage swelled to\r\nbrilliance, like the large tear at the fall; darkening under her present\r\neffort to comprehend the necessity it was for him to mix and be foremost\r\nwith the world.  Unable to grasp it perfectly in mind, her compassionate\r\nlove embraced it: she blamed herself, for being the obstruction to him.\r\n\r\n'Very well,' she said on a sigh.  'Then we shall not have to let our girl\r\ngo from us?'\r\n\r\n'Just a few weeks.  In the middle of dinner, I scribbled a telegram to\r\nthe Duvidneys, for Skepsey to take.'\r\n\r\n'Speaking of Nesta?'\r\n\r\n'Of my coming to-morrow.  They won't stop me.  I dine with them, sleep at\r\nthe Wells; hotel for a night.  We are to be separated for a night.'\r\n\r\nShe laid her hand in his and gave him a passing view of her face: 'For\r\ntwo, dear.  I am .  .  .  that man's visit--rather shaken: I shall have a\r\nbetter chance of sleeping if I know I am not disturbing you.'\r\n\r\nShe was firm; and they kissed and parted.  Each had an unphrased\r\nspeculation upon the power of Mrs. Burman to put division between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTREATS OF THE LADIES' LAPDOG TASSO FOR AN INSTANCE OF MOMENTOUS EFFECTS\r\nPRODUCED BY VERY MINOR CAUSES\r\n\r\nThe maiden ladies Dorothea and Virginia Duvidney were thin--sweet old-\r\nfashioned grey gentlewomen, demurely conscious of their excellence and\r\nawake to the temptation in the consciousness, who imposed a certain\r\nreflex primness on the lips of the world when addressing them or when\r\nalluding to them.  For their appearance was picturesque of the ancestral\r\ntime, and their ideas and scrupulousness of delivery suggested the\r\nbelated in ripeness; orchard apples under a snow-storm; or any image that\r\nwill ceremoniously convey the mind's profound appreciation together with\r\nthe tooth's panic dread of tartness.  They were by no means tart; only,\r\nas you know, the tooth is apprehensively nervous; an uninviting sign will\r\nset it on edge.  Even the pen which would sketch them has a spell on it\r\nand must don its coat of office, walk the liveried footman behind them.\r\n\r\nTheir wealth, their deeds of charity, their modesty, their built grey\r\nlocks, their high repute; a 'Chippendale elegance' in a quaintly formal\r\ncorrectness, that they had, as Colney Durance called it; gave them some\r\nqueenliness, and allowed them to claim the ear as an oracle and banish\r\nrebellious argument.  Intuitive knowledge, assisted by the Rev. Stuart\r\nRem and the Rev. Abram Posterley, enabled them to pronounce upon men and\r\nthings; not without effect; their country owned it; the foreigner beheld\r\nit.  Nor were they corrupted by the servility of the surrounding ear.\r\nThey were good women, striving to be humbly good.  They might, for all\r\nthe little errors they nightly unrolled to then perceptions, have stood\r\nbefore the world for a study in the white of our humanity.  And this may\r\nbe but a washed wall, it is true: revolutionary sceptics are measuring\r\nthe depths of it.  But the hue refreshes, the world admires; and we know\r\nit an object of aim to the bettermost of the wealthy.  If, happily,\r\ncomplacent circumstances have lifted us to the clean paved platform out\r\nof grip of puddled clay and bespattering wheeltracks, we get our chance\r\nof coming to it.\r\n\r\nPossessing, for example, nine thousand pounds per annum in Consols, and\r\nnot expending the whole of it upon our luxuries, we are, without further\r\nprivation, near to kindling the world's enthusiasm for whiteness.  Yet\r\nthere, too, we find, that character has its problems to solve; there are\r\nshades in salt.  We must be charitable, but we should be just; we give to\r\nthe poor of the land, but we are eminently the friends of our servants;\r\nduty to mankind diverts us not from the love we bear to our dog; and with\r\na pathetic sorrow for silt, we discard it from sight and hearing.  We\r\nhate dirt.  Having said so much, having shown it, by sealing the mouth of\r\nMr. Stuart Rem and iceing the veins of Mr. Abram Posterley, in relation\r\nto a dreadful public case and a melancholy private, we have a pleased\r\nsense of entry into the world's ideal.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we protest our unworthiness.  Acknowledgeing that they\r\nwere not purely spotless, these ladies genuinely took the tiny fly-spot\r\nfor a spur to purification; and they viewed it as a patch to raise in\r\nrelief their goodness.  They gazed on it, saw themselves in it, and\r\nveiled it: warned of the cunning of an oft-defeated Tempter.\r\n\r\nTo do good and sleep well, was their sowing and their reaping.  Uneasy\r\nconsciences could not have slept.  The sleeping served for proof of an\r\naccurate reckoning and an expungeing of the day's debits.  They differed\r\nin opinion now and then, as we see companion waves of the river, blown by\r\na gust, roll a shadow between them; and almost equally transient were\r\ntheir differences with a world that they condemned when they could not\r\nfeel they (as an embodiment of their principles) were leading it.  The\r\nEnglish world at times betrayed a restiveness in the walled pathway of\r\nvirtue; for, alas, it closely neighbours the French; only a Channel,\r\noften dangerously smooth, to divide: but it is not perverted for long;\r\nand the English Funds are always constant and a tower.  Would they be\r\nsuffered to be so, if libertinism were in the ascendant?\r\n\r\nColney Durance was acquainted with the Duvidney ladies.  Hearing of the\r\njourney to them and the purport of it, he said, with the mask upon glee:\r\n'Then Victor has met his match!'  Nataly had sent for him to dine with\r\nher in Victor's absence: she was far from grieved, as to the result, by\r\nhis assurance to her, that Victor had not a chance.  Colney thought so.\r\n'Just like him! to be off gaily to try and overcome or come over the\r\ngreatest power in England.'  They were England herself; the squat old\r\nwoman she has become by reason of her overlapping numbers of the\r\ncomfortable fund-holder annuitants: a vast body of passives and\r\nnegatives, living by precept, according to rules of precedent,\r\nand supposing themselves to be righteously guided because of their\r\ncontinuing undisturbed.  Them he branded, as hypocritical materialists,\r\nand the country for pride in her sweetmeat plethora of them:--mixed with\r\nan ancient Hebrew fear of offence to an inscrutable Lord, eccentrically\r\nappeasable through the dreary iteration of the litany of sinfulness.\r\nHe was near a truth; and he had the heat of it on him.\r\n\r\nSatirists in their fervours might be near it to grasp it, if they could\r\nbe moved to moral distinctness, mental intention, with a preference of\r\nstrong plain speech over the crack of their whips.  Colney could not or\r\nwould not praise our modern adventurous, experimental, heroic, tramping\r\nactive, as opposed to yonder pursy passives and negatives; he had\r\noccasions for flicking the fellow sharply: and to speak of the Lord as\r\nour friend present with us, palpable to Reason, perceptible to natural\r\npiety solely through the reason, which justifies punishment; that would\r\nhave stopped his mouth upon the theme of God-forsaken creatures.  Our\r\nsatirist is an executioner by profession, a moralist in excuse, or at the\r\ntail of it; though he thinks the position reversed, when he moralizes\r\nangrily to have his angry use of the scourge condoned.  Nevertheless, he\r\nfills a serviceable place; and certainly he is not happy in his business.\r\nColney suffered as heavily as he struck.  If he had been no more than a\r\nmime in the motley of satire, he would have sucked compensation from the\r\nacid of his phrases, for the failure to prick and goad, and work\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nHe dramatized to Nataly some of the scene going on at the Wells: Victor's\r\npetition; his fugue in urgency of it; the brief reply of Miss Dorothea\r\nand her muted echo Miss Virginia.  He was rather their apologist for\r\nrefusing.  But, as when, after himself listening to their 'views,' he had\r\ndeferentially withdrawn from the ladies of Moorsedge, and had then beheld\r\ntheir strangely-hatted lieutenants and the regiments of the toneless\r\nrespectable on the pantiles and the mounts, the curse upon the satirist\r\nimpelled him to generalize.  The quiet good ladies were multiplied: they\r\nwere 'the thousands of their sisters, petticoated or long-coated or buck-\r\nskinned; comfortable annuitants under clerical shepherding, close upon\r\noutnumbering the labourers they paralyze at home and stultify abroad.'\r\nColney thumped away.  The country's annuitants had for type 'the figure\r\nwith the helmet of the Owl-Goddess and the trident of the Earth-shaker,\r\nseated on a wheel, at the back of penny-pieces; in whom you see neither\r\nthe beauty of nakedness nor the charm of drapery; not the helmet's\r\ndignity or the trident's power; but she has patently that which stops the\r\nwheel; and poseing for representative of an imperial nation, she helps to\r\npass a penny.'  So he passed his epigram, heedless of the understanding\r\nor attention of his hearer; who temporarily misjudged him for a man\r\nimpelled by the vanity of literary point and finish, when indeed it was\r\nhot satiric spite, justified of its aim, which crushed a class to extract\r\na drop of scathing acid, in the interests of the country, mankind as\r\nwell.  Nataly wanted a picture painted, colours and details, that she\r\nmight get a vision of the scene at Moorsedge.  She did her best to feel\r\nan omen and sound it, in his question 'whether the yearly increasing army\r\nof the orderly annuitants and their parasites does not demonstrate the\r\nproud old country as a sheath for pith rather than of the vital run of\r\nsap.'\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was patriotic to inquire; and doubtless she was the weakest of\r\nwomen; she could follow no thought; her heart was beating blindly beside\r\nVictor, hopeing for the refusal painful to her through his\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\n'You think me foolish,' she made answer to one of Colney's shrugs; 'and\r\nit has come to that pitch with me, that I cannot be sensible of a merit\r\nexcept in being one with him--obeying, is the word.  And I have never yet\r\nknown him fail.  That terrible Lakelands wears a different look to me,\r\nwhen I think of what he can do; though I would give half my days to\r\nescape it.'\r\n\r\nShe harped on the chord of feverish extravagance; the more hateful to\r\nColney because of his perceiving, that she simulated a blind devotedness\r\nto stupefy her natural pride; and he was divided between stamping on her\r\nfor an imbecile and dashing at Victor for a maniac.  But her situation\r\nrendered her pitiable.  'You will learn tomorrow what Victor has done,'\r\nhe said, and thought how the simple words carried the bitterness.\r\n\r\nThat was uttered within a few minutes of midnight, when the ladies of\r\nMoorsedge themselves, after an exhausting resistance to their dearest\r\nrelative, were at the hall-door of the house with Victor, saying the\r\ngood-night, to which he responded hurriedly, cordially, dumbly, a baffled\r\nman.  They clasped hands.  Miss Dorothea said:\r\n\r\n'You, Victor, always.'  Miss Virginia said: 'You will be sure of\r\nwelcome.'  He walked out upon the moonless night; and for lack of any\r\nrounded object in the smothering darkness to look at, he could nowhere\r\ntake moorings to gather himself together and define the man who had\r\nundergone so portentous a defeat.  He was glad of quarters at an hotel,\r\na solitary bed, absence from his Nataly.\r\n\r\nFor their parts, the ladies were not less shattered.  They had no triumph\r\nin their victory: the weight of it bore them down.  They closed, locked,\r\nshot the bolts and fastened the chain of the door.  They had to be\r\nreminded by the shaking of their darling dog Tasso's curly silky coat,\r\nthat he had not taken his evening's trot to notify malefactors of his\r\nwatchfulness and official wrath at sound of footfall or a fancied one.\r\nWithout consultation, they unbolted the door, and Tasso went forth, to\r\n'compose his vesper hymn,' as Mr. Posterley once remarked amusingly.\r\n\r\nThough not pretending to the Muse's crown so far, the little dog had\r\nqualities to entrance the spinster sex.  His mistresses talked of him;\r\nof his readiness to go forth; of the audible first line of his hymn or\r\nsonnet; of his instinct telling him that something was wrong in the\r\nestablishment.  For most of the servants at Moorsedge were prostrated by\r\na fashionable epidemic; a slight attack, the doctor said; but Montague,\r\nthe butler, had withdrawn for the nursing of his wife; Perrin, the\r\nfootman, was confined to his chamber; Manton, the favourite maid, had\r\nappeared in the morning with a face that caused her banishment to bed;\r\nand the cook, Mrs. Bannister, then sighingly agreed to send up cold meat\r\nfor the ladies' dinner.  Hence their melancholy inhospitality to their\r\ncousin Victor, who had, in spite of his errors, the right to claim his\r\nplace at their table, was 'of the blood,' they said.  He was recognized\r\nas the living prince of it.  His every gesture, every word, recalled the\r\nGeneral.  The trying scene with him had withered them, they did not speak\r\nof it; each had to the other the look of a vessel that has come out of a\r\ngale.  Would they sleep?  They scarcely dared ask it of themselves.  They\r\nhad done rightly; silence upon that reflection seemed best.  It was the\r\nsilence of an inward agitation; still they knew the power of good\r\nconsciences to summon sleep.\r\n\r\nTasso was usually timed for five minutes.  They were astonished to\r\ndiscover by the clock, that they had given him ten.  He was very quiet:\r\nif so, and for whatever he did, he had his reason, they said: he was a\r\ndog endowed with reason: endowed--and how they wished that Mr. Stuart Rem\r\nwould admit it!--with, their love of the little dog believed (and Mr.\r\nPosterley acquiesced), a soul.  Do but think it of dear animals, and any\r\nform of cruelty to them becomes an impossibility, Mr. Stuart Rem!  But he\r\nwould not be convinced: ungenerously indeed he named Mr. Posterley a\r\ncourtier.  The ladies could have retorted, that Mr. Posterley had not a\r\nbrother who was the celebrated surgeon Sir Nicholas Rem.\r\n\r\nUsually Tasso came running in when the hall-door was opened to him.\r\nNot a sound of him could be heard.  The ladies blew his familiar whistle.\r\nHe trotted back to a third appeal, and was, unfortunately for them, not\r\ncaressed; he received reproaches from two forefingers directed straight\r\nat his reason.  He saw it and felt it.  The hug of him was deferred to\r\nthe tender good-night to him in his basket at the foot of the ladies'\r\nbeds.\r\n\r\nOn entering their spacious bed-chamber, they were so fatigued that sleep\r\nappeared to their minds the compensating logical deduction.  Miss\r\nDorothea suppressed a yawn, and inflicted it upon Miss Virginia, who\r\nreturned it, with an apology, and immediately had her sister's hand on\r\nher shoulder, for, an attempted control of one of the irresistibles; a\r\nspecacle imparting bitter shudders and shots to the sympathetic jawbones\r\nof an observer.  Hand at mouth, for not in privacy would they have been\r\nguilty of exposing a grimace, they signified, under an interim smile,\r\ntheir maidenly submission to the ridiculous force of nature: after which,\r\nMiss Virginia retired to the dressing-room, absorbed in woeful\r\nrecollection of the resolute No they had been compelled to reiterate,\r\nin response to the most eloquent and, saving for a single instance,\r\nadmirable man, their cousin, the representative of 'the blood,'\r\nsupplicating them.  A recreant thankfulness coiled within her bosom at\r\nthe thought, that Dorothea, true to her office of speaker, had tasked\r\nherself with the cruel utterance and repetition of the word.  Victor's\r\nwonderful eyes, his voice, yet more than his urgent pleas; and also, in\r\nthe midst of his fiery flood of speech, his gentleness, his patience,\r\npathos, and a man's tone through it all; were present to her.\r\n\r\nDisrobed, she knocked at the door.\r\n\r\n'I have called to you twice,' Dorothea said; and she looked a motive for\r\nthe call.\r\n\r\n'What is it?' said Virginia, with faltering sweetness, with a terrible\r\ndivination.\r\n\r\nThe movement of a sigh was made.  'Are you aware of anything, dear?'\r\n\r\nVirginia was taken with the contrary movement of a sniff.  But the fear\r\ninforming it prevented it from being venturesome.  Doubt of the pure\r\natmosphere of their bed-chamber, appeared to her as too heretic even for\r\nthe positive essay.  In affirming, that she was not aware of anything,\r\nher sight fell on Tasso.  His eyeballs were those of a little dog that\r\nhas been awfully questioned.\r\n\r\n'It is more than a suspicion,' said Dorothea; and plainly now, while open\r\nto the seductions of any pleasing infidel testimony, her nose in\r\nrepugnance convicted him absolutely.\r\n\r\nVirginia's nose was lowered a few inches; it inhaled and stopped midway.\r\n'You must be mistaken, dear.  He never .  .  .  '\r\n\r\n'But are you insensible to the .  .  .'  Dorothea's eyelids fainted.\r\n\r\nVirginia dismissed the forlornest of efforts at incredulity.  A whiff\r\nof Tasso had smitten her.  'Ah!' she exclaimed and fell away.  'Is it\r\nTasso!  How was it you noticed nothing before undressing, dear?'\r\n\r\n'Thinking of what we have gone through to-night!  I forgot him.  At last\r\nthe very strange .  .  .  The like of it I have not ever!  .  .  .  And\r\nupon that thick coat!  And, dear, it is late.  We are in the morning\r\nhours.'\r\n\r\n'But, my dear-Oh, dear, what is to be done with him?'\r\n\r\nThat was the crucial point for discussion.  They had no servant to give\r\nthem aid; Manton, they could not dream of disturbing.  And Tasso's\r\ncharacter wag in the estimate; he hated washing; it balefully depraved\r\nhis temper; and not only, creature of habit that he was, would he decline\r\nto lie down anywhere save in their bedroom, he would lament, plead,\r\ninsist unremittingly, if excluded; terrifying every poor invalid of the\r\nhouse.  Then again, were they at this late hour to dress themselves, and\r\ntake him downstairs, and light a fire in the kitchen, and boil sufficient\r\nwater to give him a bath and scrubbing?  Cold water would be death to\r\nhim.  Besides, he would ring out his alarum for the house to hear, pour\r\nout all his poetry, poor dear, as Mr. Posterley called it, at a touch of\r\ncold water.  The catastrophe was one to weep over, the dilemma a trial of\r\nthe strongest intelligences.\r\n\r\nIn addition to reviews of their solitary alternative-the having of a\r\nbefouled degraded little dog in their chamber through the night, they\r\nwere subjected to a conflict of emotions when eyeing him: and there came\r\nto them the painful, perhaps irreverent, perhaps uncharitable, thought:--\r\nthat the sinner who has rolled in the abominable, must cleanse him and do\r\nthings to polish him and perfume before again embraced even by the mind:\r\nif indeed we can ever have our old sentiment for him again!  Mr. Stuart\r\nRem might decide it for them.  Nay, before even the heart embraces him,\r\nhe must completely purify himself.  That is to say, the ordinary human\r\nsinner--save when a relative.  Contemplating Tasso, the hearts of the\r\nladies gushed out in pity of an innocent little dog, knowing not evil,\r\ndependent on his friends for help to be purified;--necessarily kept at a\r\ndistance: the very look of him prescribed extreme separation, as far as\r\npracticable.  But they had proof of a love almost greater than it was\r\nprevious to the offence, in the tender precautions they took to elude\r\nrepulsion.\r\n\r\nHe was rolling on the rug, communicating contagion.  Flasks of treble-\r\ndistilled lavender water, and their favourite, traditional in the family,\r\neau d'Arquebusade, were on the toilet-table.  They sprinkled his basket,\r\nliberally sprinkled the rug and the little dog.  Perfume-pastilles were\r\nin one of the sitting-rooms below; and Virginia would have gone down\r\nsoftly to fetch a box, but Dorothea restrained her, in pity for the\r\nservants, with the remark: 'It would give us a nightmare of a Roman\r\nCatholic Cathedral!'  A bit of the window was lifted by Dorothea,\r\ncautiously, that prowling outsiders might not be attracted.  Tasso was\r\nwooed to his basket.  He seemed inquisitive; the antidote of his\r\nnaughtiness excited him; his tail circled after his muzzle several times;\r\nthen he lay.  A silken scarf steeped in eau d'Arquebusade was flung\r\nacross him.\r\n\r\nTheir customary devout observances concluded, lights were extinguished,\r\nand the ladies kissed, and entered their beds.\r\n\r\nTheir beds were not homely to them.  Dorothea thought that Virginia was\r\nlong in settling herself.  Virginia did not like the sound of Dorothea's\r\ndouble sigh.  Both listened anxiously for the doings of Tasso.  He\r\nrested.\r\n\r\nHe was uneasy; he was rounding his basket once more; unaware of the\r\nexaggeration of his iniquitous conduct, poor innocent, he shook that\r\ndreadful coat of his!  He had displaced the prophylactic cover of the\r\nscarf.\r\n\r\nHe drove them in a despair to speculate on the contention between the\r\nperfume and the stench in junction, with such a doubt of the victory of\r\nwhich of the two, as drags us to fear our worst.  It steals into our\r\nnostrils, possesses them.  As the History of Mankind has informed us,\r\nwe were led up to our civilization by the nose.  But Philosophy warns us\r\non that eminence; to beware of trusting exclusively to our conductor,\r\nlest the mind of us at least be plunged back into barbarism.  The ladies\r\nhated both the cause and the consequence, they had a revulsion from the\r\nobject, of the above contention.  But call it not a contention: there is\r\nnobility in that.  This was a compromise, a degrading union, with very\r\nsickening results.  Whether they came of an excess of the sprinkling,\r\ncould not well be guessed.  The drenching at least was righteously\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nBeneath their shut eyelids, they felt more and more the oppression of a\r\ndarkness not laden with slumber.  They saw it insolidity; themselves as\r\nrestless billows, driven dashing to the despondent sigh.  Sleep was\r\ndenied them.\r\n\r\nTasso slept.  He had sinned unknowingly, and that is not a spiritual sin;\r\nthe chastisement confers the pardon.\r\n\r\nBut why was this ineffable blessing denied to them?  Was it that they\r\nmight have a survey of all the day's deeds and examine them under the\r\ncruel black beams of Insomnia?\r\n\r\nVirginia said: 'You are wakeful.'\r\n\r\n'Thoughtful,' was the answer.\r\n\r\nA century of the midnight rolled on.\r\n\r\nDorothea said: 'He behaved very beautifully.'\r\n\r\n'I looked at the General's portrait while he besought us,' Virginia\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n'One sees him in Victor, at Victor's age.  Try to sleep.'\r\n\r\n'I do.  I pray that you may.'\r\n\r\nSilence courted slumber.  Their interchange of speech from the posture\r\nof bodies on their backs, had been low and deliberate, in the tone of\r\nthe vaults.  Dead silence recalled the strangeness of it.  The night was\r\nbreathless; their open window a peril bestowing no boon.  They were\r\nmutually haunted by sound of the gloomy query at the nostrils of each\r\nwhen drawing the vital breath.  But for that, they thought they might\r\nhave slept.\r\n\r\nBed spake to bed:\r\n\r\n'The words of Mr. Stuart Rem last Sunday!'  'He said: \"Be just.\"  Could\r\none but see direction!'\r\n\r\n'In obscurity, feeling is a guide.'\r\n\r\n'The heart.'\r\n\r\n'It may sometimes be followed.'\r\n\r\n'When it concerns the family.'\r\n\r\n'He would have the living, who are seeking peace, be just.'\r\n\r\n'Not to assume the seat of justice.'\r\n\r\nAgain they lay as tombstone effigies, that have committed the passage of\r\naffairs to another procession of the Ages.\r\n\r\nThere was a gentle sniff, in hopeless confirmation of the experience of\r\nits predecessors.  A sister to it ensued.\r\n\r\n'Could Victor have spoken so, without assurance in his conscience, that\r\nhis entreaty was righteously addressed to us?  that we .  .  .'\r\n\r\n'And no others!'\r\n\r\n'I think of his language.  He loves the child.'\r\n\r\n'In heart as in mind, he is eminently gifted; acknowledgeing error.'\r\n\r\n'He was very young.'\r\n\r\nThe huge funereal minutes conducted their sonorous hearse, the hour.\r\n\r\nIt struck in the bed-room: Three.\r\n\r\nNo more than three of the clock, it was the voice telling of half the\r\nprecious restorative night-hours wasted.\r\n\r\nNow, as we close our eyelids when we would go to sleep, so must we,\r\nin expectation of the peace of mind granting us the sweet oblivion,\r\npreliminarily do something which invokes, that we may obtain it.\r\n\r\n'Dear,' Dorothea said.\r\n\r\n'I know indeed,' said Virginia.\r\n\r\n'We may have been!'\r\n\r\n'Not designingly.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed not.  But harsh it may be named, if the one innocent is to be the\r\nsufferer.'\r\n\r\n'The child can in no sense be adjudged guilty.'\r\n\r\n'It is Victor's child.'\r\n\r\n'He adores the child.'\r\n\r\nWheels were in mute motion within them; and presently the remark was\r\ntossed-up:\r\n\r\n'In his coming to us, it is possible to see paternal solicitude'\r\n\r\nThence came fruit of reflection:\r\n\r\n'To be instrumental as guides to a tender young life!'\r\n\r\nReflection heated with visions:\r\n\r\n'Once our dream!'\r\n\r\nThey had the happier feeling of composure, though Tasso possessed\r\nthe room.  Not Tasso, but a sublimated offensiveness, issue of the\r\nantagonistically combined, dispersed to be the more penetrating;\r\ninsomuch that it seemed to them they could not ever again make use of eau\r\nd'Arquebusade without the vitiating reminder.  So true were the words of\r\nMr. Stuart Rem: 'Half measures to purification are the most delusive of\r\nour artifices.'  Fatigue and its reflections helped to be peacefuller.\r\nTheir souls were mounting to a serenity above the nauseating degradation,\r\nto which the poor little dog had dragged them.\r\n\r\n'Victor gave his promise.'\r\n\r\n'At least, concession would not imply contact with the guilty.'\r\n\r\nBoth sighed as they took up the burden of the vaporous Tasso to drop him;\r\nwith the greater satisfaction in the expelling of their breath.\r\n\r\n'It might be said, dear, that concession to his entreaty does not in any\r\nway countenance the sin.'\r\n\r\n'I can see, dear, how it might be read as a reproof.'\r\n\r\nTheir exchange of sentences followed meditative pauses; Dorothea leading.\r\n\r\n'To one so sensitive as Victor!'\r\n\r\n'A month or two of our society for the child!'\r\n\r\n'It is not the length of time.'\r\n\r\n'The limitation assures against maternal claims.'\r\n\r\n'She would not dare.'\r\n\r\n'He used the words: \"her serious respect\" for us.  I should not wish to\r\nlisten to him often.'\r\n\r\n'We listen to a higher.'\r\n\r\n'It may really be, that the child is like him.'\r\n\r\n'Not resembling Mr. Stuart Rem's Clementina!'\r\n\r\n'A week of that child gave us our totally sleepless night.'  'One thinks\r\nmore hopefully of a child of Victor's.'\r\n\r\n'He would preponderate.'\r\n\r\n'He would.'\r\n\r\nThey sighed; but it was now with the relief of a lightened oppression.\r\n\r\n'If, dear, in truth the father's look is in the child, he has the greater\r\nreason to desire for her a taste of our atmosphere.'\r\n\r\n'Do not pursue it.  Sleep.'\r\n\r\n'One prayer!'\r\n\r\n'Your mention of our atmosphere, dear, destroys my power to frame one.\r\nDo you, for two.  But I would cleanse my heart.'\r\n\r\n'There is none purer.'\r\n\r\n'Hush.'\r\n\r\nVirginia spoke a more fervent word of praise of her sister, and had not\r\nthe hushing response to it.  She heard the soft regular breathing.  Her\r\nown was in downy fellowship with it a moment later.\r\n\r\nAt the hour of nine, in genial daylight, sitting over the crumbs of his\r\nhotel breakfast, Victor received a little note that bore the handwriting\r\nof Dorothea Duvidney.\r\n\r\n     'Dear Victor, we are prepared to receive the child for a month.\r\n     In haste, before your train.  Our love.  D. and V.'\r\n\r\nHis face flashed out of cloud.\r\n\r\nA more precious document had never been handed to him.  It chased back to\r\nmidnight the doubt hovering over his belief in himself;--phrased to say,\r\nthat he was no longer the Victor Radnor known to the world.  And it\r\nextinguished a corpse-like recollection of a baleful dream in the night.\r\nHere shone radiant witness of his being the very man; save for the spot\r\nof his recent confusion in distinguishing his identity or in feeling that\r\nhe stood whole and solid.--Because of two mature maiden ladies?  Yes,\r\nbecause of two maiden ladies, my good fellow.  And friend Colney, you\r\nknow the ladies, and what the getting round them for one's purposes\r\nreally means.\r\n\r\nThe sprite of Colney Durance had struck him smartly overnight.  Victor's\r\ninternal crow was over Colney now.  And when you have the optimist and\r\npessimist acutely opposed in a mixing group, they direct lively\r\nconversations at one another across the gulf of distance, even of time.\r\nFor a principle is involved, besides the knowledge of the other's triumph\r\nor dismay.  The couple are scales of a balance; and not before last night\r\nhad Victor ever consented to think of Colney ascending while he dropped\r\nlow to graze the pebbles.\r\n\r\nHe left his hotel for the station, singing the great aria of the fourth\r\nAct of the Favorita: neglected since that mighty German with his Rienzi,\r\nand Tannhauser, and Tristan and Isolda, had mastered him, to the\r\ndisplacement of his boyhood's beloved sugary -inis and -antes and\r\n-zettis; had clearly mastered, not beguiled, him; had wafted him up to a\r\nnew realm, invigorating if severer.  But now his youth would have its\r\nvoice.  He travelled up to town with Sir Abraham Quatley and talked, and\r\ntook and gave hints upon City and Commercial affairs, while the honeyed\r\nItalian of the conventional, gloriously animal, stress and flutter had a\r\nrevel in his veins, now and then mutedly ebullient at the mouth: honeyed,\r\ngolden, rich in visions;--having surely much more of Nature's\r\nencouragement to her children?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nNESTA'S ENGAGEMENT\r\n\r\nA word in his ear from Fenellan, touching that man Blathenoy,\r\nset the wheels of Victor's brain at work upon his defences, for a minute,\r\non the walk Westward.  Who knew?--who did not know!  He had a torpid\r\nconsciousness that he cringed to the world, with an entreaty to the great\r\nmonster to hold off in ignorance; and the next instant, he had caught its\r\nmiserable spies by the lurcher neck and was towering.  He dwelt on his\r\ncontempt of them, to curtain the power they could stir.\r\n\r\n'The little woman, you say, took to Dartrey?'\r\n\r\nFenellan, with the usual apologetic moderation of a second statement,\r\nthought 'there was the look of it.'\r\n\r\n'Well, we must watch over her.  Dartrey!--but Dartrey's an honest fellow\r\nwith women.  But men are men.  Very few men spare a woman when the mad\r\nfit is on her.  A little woman-pretty little woman!--wife to Jacob\r\nBlathenoy!  She mustn't at her age have any close choosing--under her\r\nhand.  And Dartrey's just the figure to strike a spark in a tinder-box\r\nhead.'\r\n\r\n'With a husband who'd reduce Minerva's to tinder, after a month of him!'\r\n\r\n'He spent his honeymoon at his place at Wrensham; told me so.'  Blathenoy\r\nhad therefore then heard of the building of Lakelands by the Victor\r\nRadnor of the City; and had then, we guess--in the usual honeymoon\r\nboasting of a windbag with his bride--wheezed the foul gossip, to hide\r\nhis emptiness and do duty for amusement of the pretty little caged bird.\r\nProbably so.  But Victor knew that Blathenoy needed him and feared him.\r\nProbably the wife had been enjoined to keep silence; for the\r\nBlachingtons, Fannings and others were, it could be sworn, blank and\r\nunscratched folio sheets on the subject:--as yet; unless Mrs. Burman had\r\ndropped venom.\r\n\r\n'One pities the little woman, eh, Fenellan?'\r\n\r\n'Dartrey won't be back for a week or so; and they're off to Switzerland,\r\nafter the dinner they give.  I heard from him this morning; one of the\r\nClanconans is ill.\r\n\r\n'Lucky.  But wherever Blathenoy takes her, he must be the same \"arid\r\nbore,\" as old Colney says.'\r\n\r\n'A domestic simoom,' said Fenellan, booming it: and Victor had a shudder.\r\n\r\n'Awful thing, marriage, to some women!  We chain them to that domestic\r\nround; most of them haven't the means of independence or a chance of\r\nwinning it; and all that's open to them, if they've made a bad cast for a\r\nmate--and good Lord!  how are they to know before it's too late!--they\r\nhaven't a choice except to play tricks or jump to the deuce or sit and\r\n\"drape in blight,\" as Colney has it; though his notion of the optional\r\nmarriages, broken or renewed every seven years!--if he means it.  You\r\nnever know, with him.  It sounds like another squirt of savage irony.\r\nIt's donkey nonsense, eh?'\r\n\r\n'The very hee-haw of nonsense,' Fenellan acquiesced.\r\n\r\n'Come, come; read your Scriptures; donkeys have shown wisdom,' Victor\r\nsaid, rather leaning to the theme of a fretfulness of women in the legal\r\nyoke.  'They're donkeys till we know them for prophets.  Who can tell!\r\nColney may be hailed for one fifty years hence.'\r\n\r\nFenellan was not invited to enter the house, although the loneliness of\r\nhis lodgeings was known, and also, that he played whist at his Club.\r\nVictor had grounds for turning to him at the door and squeezing his hand\r\nwarmly, by way of dismissal.  In ascribing them to a weariness at\r\nFenellan's perpetual acquiescence, he put the cover on them, and he\r\nstamped it with a repudiation of the charge, that Colney's views upon the\r\ngreat Marriage Question were the 'very hee-haw of nonsense.'  They were\r\nnot the hee-haw; in fact, viewing the host of marriages, they were for\r\ndiscussion; there was no bray about them.  He could not feel them to be\r\nabsurd while Mrs. Burman's tenure of existence barred the ceremony.\r\nAnything for a phrase! he murmured of Fenellan's talk; calling him, Dear\r\nold boy, to soften the slight.\r\n\r\nNataly had not seen Fenellan or heard from Dartrey; so she continued to\r\nbe uninformed of her hero's release; and that was in the order of happy\r\naccidents.  She had hardly to look her interrogation for the news; it\r\nradiated.  But he stated such matter-of-course briefly.  'The good ladies\r\nare ready to receive our girl.'\r\n\r\nHer chagrin resolved to a kind of solace of her draggled pride, in the\r\nidea, that he who tamed everybody to submission, might well have command\r\nof her.\r\n\r\nThe note, signed D.  and V., was shown.\r\n\r\nThere stood the words.  And last night she had been partly of the opinion\r\nof Colney Durance.  She sank down among the unreasoning abject;--not this\r\ntime with her perfect love of him, but with a resistance and a dubiety\r\nunder compression.  For she had not quite comprehended why Nesta should\r\ngo.  This readiness of the Duvidney ladies to receive the girl, stopped\r\nher mental inquiries.\r\n\r\nShe begged for a week's delay; 'before the parting'; as her dear old\r\nsilly mother's pathos whimpered it, of the separation for a month! and he\r\nsmiled and hummed pleasantly at any small petition, thinking her in error\r\nto expect Dartrey's return to town before the close of a week; and then\r\nwondering at women, mildly denouncing in his heart the mothers who ran\r\nrisk of disturbing their daughters' bosoms with regard to particular\r\nheroes married or not.  Dartrey attracted women: he was one of the men\r\nwho do it without effort.  Victor's provident mind blamed the mother for\r\nthe indiscreetness of her wish to have him among them.  But Dudley had\r\nbeen making way bravely of late; he improved; he began to bloom, like a\r\nSpring flower of the garden protected from frosts under glass; and Fredi\r\nwas the sheltering and nourishing bestower of the lessons.  One could\r\nsee, his questions and other little points revealed, that he had a\r\ncertain lover's dread of Dartrey Fenellan; a sort of jealousy: Victor\r\nunderstood the feeling.  To love a girl, who has her ideal of a man\r\nelsewhere in another; though she may know she never can wed the man, and\r\nhas not the hope of it; is torment to the lover quailing, as we do in\r\nthis terrible season of the priceless deliciousness, stripped against all\r\nthe winds that blow; skinless at times.  One gets up a sympathy for the\r\npoor shy dependent shivering lover.  Nevertheless, here was young Dudley\r\nwaking, visibly becoming bolder.  As in the flute-duets, he gained fire\r\nfrom concert.  The distance between Cronidge and Moorsedge was two miles\r\nand a quarter.\r\n\r\nInstead of the delay of a whole week, Victor granted four days, which\r\nembraced a musical evening at Mrs. John Cormyn's on the last of the days,\r\nwhen Nesta was engaged to sing with her mother a duet of her own\r\ncomposition, the first public fruit of her lessons in counterpoint from\r\nrigid Herr Strauscher, who had said what he had said, in letting it pass:\r\neulogy, coming from him.  So Victor heard, and he doated am the surprise\r\nto come for him, in a boyish anticipation.  The girl's little French\r\nballads under tutelage of Louise de Seilles promised, though they were\r\nimitative.  If Strauscher let this pass .  .  .  Victor saw Grand Opera\r\nsomewhere to follow; England's claim to be a creative musical nation\r\nvindicated; and the genius of the fair sex as well.\r\n\r\nHe heard the duet at Mrs. Cormyn's; and he imagined a hearing of his\r\nFredi's Opera, and her godmother's delight in it; the once famed\r\nSanfredini's consent to be the diva at a rehearsal, and then her\r\ncompelling her hidalgo duque to consent further: an event not\r\ninconceivable.  For here was downright genius; the flowering aloe of the\r\nmany years in formation; and Colney admitted the song to have a streak of\r\ngenius; though he would pettishly and stupidly say, that our modern\r\nnewspaper Press is able now to force genius for us twenty or so to the\r\nmonth, excluding Sundays-our short pauses for the incubation of it.  Real\r\nrare genius was in that song, nothing forced; and exquisite melody; one\r\nof those melodies which fling gold chains about us and lead us off, lead\r\nus back into Eden.  Victor hummed at bars of it on the drive homeward.\r\nHis darlings had to sing it again in the half-lighted drawing-room.  The\r\nbubble-happiness of the three was vexed only by tidings heard from Colney\r\nduring the evening of a renewed instance of Skepsey's misconduct.\r\nPriscilla Graves had hurried away to him at the close of Mr. John\r\nCormyn's Concert, in consequence; in grief and in sympathy.  Skepsey was\r\nto appear before the magistrate next morning, for having administered\r\nphysical chastisement to his wife during one of her fits of drunkenness.\r\nColney had seen him.  His version of the story was given, however, in the\r\nobjectionable humorous manner: none could gather from it of what might be\r\npleaded for Skepsey.  His 'lesson to his wife in the art of pugilism,\r\nbefore granting her Captain's rank among the Defensive Amazons of Old\r\nEngland,' was the customary patent absurdity.  But it was odd, that\r\nSkepsey always preferred his appeal for help to Colney Durance.  Nesta\r\nproposed following Priscilla that night.  She had hinted her wish, on the\r\nway home; she was urgent, beseeching, when her father lifted praises of\r\nher: she had to start with her father by the train at seven in the\r\nmorning, and she could not hear of poor Skepsey for a number of hours.\r\nShe begged a day's delay; which would enable her, she said, to join them\r\nin dining at the Blachingtons', and seeing dear Lakelands again.  'I was\r\ninvited, you know.'  She spoke in childish style, and under her eyes she\r\nbeheld her father and mother exchange looks.  He had a fear that Nataly\r\nmight support the girl's petition.  Nataly read him to mean, possible\r\ndangers among the people at Wrensham.  She had seemed hesitating.  After\r\nmeeting Victor's look, her refusal was firm.  She tried to make it one of\r\ndistress for the use of the hard word to her own dear girl.  Nesta spied\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nBut what was it?  There was a reason for her going!  She had a right to\r\nstay, and see and talk with Captain Dartrey, and she was to be deported!\r\n\r\nSo now she set herself to remember little incidents at Creckholt:\r\nparticularly a conversation in a very young girl's hearing, upon Sir\r\nHumphrey and Lady Pottil's behaviour to the speakers, her parents.\r\nShe had then, and she now had, an extraordinary feeling, as from a wind\r\nstriking upon soft summer weather off regions of ice, that she was in her\r\nparents' way.  How?  The feeling was irrational; it could give her no\r\nreply, or only the multitudinous which are the question violently\r\nrepeated.  She slept on it.\r\n\r\nShe and her father breakfasted by the London birds' first twitter.  They\r\ntalked of Skepsey.  She spoke of her going as exile.  'No,' said he,\r\n'you're sure to meet friends.'\r\n\r\nHer cheeks glowed.  It came wholly through the suddenness of the\r\nrecollection, that the family-seat of one among the friends was near the\r\nWells.\r\n\r\nHe was allowed to fancy, as it suited him to fancy, that a vivid secret\r\npleasure laid the colour on those ingenuous fair cheeks.\r\n\r\n'A solitary flute for me, for a month!  I shall miss my sober comrade:\r\ngot the habit of duetting: and he's gentle, bears with me.'\r\n\r\nTears lined her eyelids.  'Who would not be, dearest dada!  But there is\r\nnothing to bear except the honour.'\r\n\r\n'You like him?  You and I always have the same tastes, Fredi.'\r\n\r\nNow there was a reddening of the sun at the mount; all the sky aflame.\r\nHow could he know that it was not the heart in the face!  She reddened\r\nbecause she had perused his wishes; had detected a scheme striking off\r\nfrom them, and knew a man to be the object of it; and because she had at\r\nthe same time the sense of a flattery in her quick divination; and she\r\nwas responsively emotional, her blood virginal; often it was a tropical\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nIt looked like the heart doing rich painter's work on maiden features.\r\nVictor was naturally as deceived as he wished to be.\r\n\r\nFrom his being naturally so, his remarks on Dudley had an air of\r\nembracing him as one of the family.  'His manner to me just hits me.'\r\n\r\n'I like to see him with you,' she said.\r\n\r\nHer father let his tongue run: 'One of the few young men I feel perfectly\r\nat home with!  I do like dealing with a gentleman.  I can confide in a\r\ngentleman: honour, heart, whatever I hold dearest.'\r\n\r\nThere he stopped, not too soon.  The girl was mute, fully agreeing,\r\nslightly hardening.  She had a painful sense of separation from her dear\r\nLouise.  And it was now to be from her mother as well: she felt the pain\r\nwhen kissing her mother in bed.  But this was moderated by the prospect\r\nof a holiday away out of reach of Mr. Barmby's pursuing voice, whom her\r\nmother favoured: and her mother was concealing something from her; so she\r\ncould not make the confidante of her mother.  Nataly had no forewarnings.\r\nHer simple regrets filled her bosom.  All night she had been taking her\r\nchastisement, and in the morning it seemed good to her, that she should\r\nbe denuded, for her girl to learn the felicity of having relatives.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, over which Nataly mused in the succeeding hours, the\r\ngirl had not spoken of any visit her mother was to pay to the Duvidney\r\nladies or they to her.  Latterly she had not alluded to her mother's\r\nfamily.  It might mean, that the beloved and dreaded was laying finger on\r\na dark thing in the dark; reading syllables by touch; keeping silence\r\nover the communications to a mind not yet actively speculative, as it is\r\na way with young women.  'With young women educated for the market, to be\r\ntimorous, consequently secretive, rather snaky,' Colney Durance had said.\r\nHer Nesta was not one of the 'framed and glazed' description, cited by\r\nhim, for an example of the triumph of the product; 'exactly harmonious\r\nwith the ninny male's ideal of female innocence.'  No; but what if the\r\nmother had opened her heart to her girl?  It had been of late her wish or\r\na dream, shaping hourly to a design, now positively to go through that\r\nfurnace.  Her knowledge of Victor's objection, restrained an impulse that\r\nhad not won spring enough to act against his counsel or vivify an\r\nintelligence grown dull in slavery under him, with regard to the one\r\nseeming right course.  The adoption of it would have wounded him--\r\ntherefore her.  She had thought of him first; she had also thought of\r\nherself, and she blamed herself now.  She went so far as to think, that\r\nVictor was guilty of the schemer's error of counting human creatures\r\narithmetically, in the sum, without the estimate of distinctive qualities\r\nand value here and there.  His return to a shivering sensitiveness on the\r\nsubject of his girl's enlightenment 'just yet,' for which Nataly pitied\r\nand loved him, sharing it, with humiliation for doing so, became finally\r\nher excuse.  We must have some excuse, if we would keep to life.\r\n\r\nSkepsey's case appeared in the evening papers.  He confessed, 'frankly,'\r\nhe said, to the magistrate, that, 'acting under temporary exasperation,\r\nhe had lost for a moment a man's proper self-command.'  He was as frank\r\nin stating, that he 'occupied the prisoner's place before his Worship a\r\nsecond time, and was a second time indebted to the gentleman, Mr. Colney\r\nDurance, who so kindly stood by him.'  There was hilarity in the Court at\r\nhis quaint sententious envelopment of the idiom of the streets, which he\r\ndelivered with solemnity: 'He could only plead, not in absolute\r\njustification--an appeal to human sentiments--the feelings of a man of\r\nthe humbler orders, returning home in the evening, and his thoughts upon\r\nthings not without their importance, to find repeatedly the guardian of\r\nhis household beastly drunk, and destructive.'  Colney made the case\r\nquite intelligible to the magistrate; who gravely robed a strain of the\r\nidiomatic in the officially awful, to keep in tune with his delinquent.\r\nNo serious harm had been done to the woman.  Skepsey was admonished and\r\nreleased.  His wife expressed her willingness to forgive him, now he had\r\ngot his lesson; and she hoped he would understand, that there was no need\r\nfor a woman to learn pugilism.  Skepsey would have explained; but the\r\ncase was over, he was hustled out.\r\n\r\nHowever, a keen young reporter present smelt fun for copy; he followed\r\nthe couple; and in a particular evening Journal, laughable matter was\r\nprinted concerning Skepsey's view of the pugilism to be imparted to women\r\nfor their physical-protection in extremity, and the distinction of it\r\nfrom the blow conveying the moral lesson to them; his wife having\r\nobjected to the former, because it annoyed her and he pestered her;\r\nand she was never, she said, ready to stand up to him for practice,\r\nas he called it, except when she had taken more than he thought wholesome\r\nfor her: he had no sense.  There was a squabble between them, because he\r\nchose to scour away to his master's office instead of conducting her home\r\nwith the honours.  Nesta read the young reporter's version, with shrieks.\r\nShe led the ladies of Moorsedge to discover amusement in it.\r\n\r\nAt first, as her letter to her mother described them, they were like a\r\npair of pieces of costly China, with the settled smile, and cold.  She\r\nsaw but the outside of them, and she continued reporting the variations,\r\nwhich steadily determined the warmth.  On the night of the third day,\r\nthey kissed her tenderly; they were human figures.\r\n\r\nNo one could be aware of the trial undergone by the good ladies in\r\nreceiving her: Victor's child; but, as their phrase would have run, had\r\nthey dared to give it utterance to one another, a child of sin.  How\r\nforeign to them, in that character, how strange, when she was looked on\r\nas an inhabitant of their house, they hardly dared to estimate; until the\r\ntimorous estimation, from gradually swelling, suddenly sank; nature\r\ninvaded them; they could discard the alienating sense of the taint; and\r\nnot only did they no longer fear the moment when Mr. Stuart Rem or Mr.\r\nPosterley might call for evening tea, but they consulted upon inviting\r\nthe married one of those gentlemen, to 'divert dear Nesta.'  Every night\r\nshe slept well.  In all she did, she proved she was 'of the blood.'\r\nShe had Victor's animated eyes; she might have, they dreaded to think,\r\nhis eloquence.  They put it down to his eloquence entirely, that their\r\nresistance to his petition had been overcome, for similarly with the\r\ntreatment of the private acts of royal personages by lacquey History,\r\nthere is, in the minds of the ultra-civilized, an insistance, that any\r\nevent having a consequence in matters personal to them, be at all hazards\r\nrecorded with the utmost nicety in decency.  By such means, they preserve\r\nthe ceremonial self-respect, which is a necessity of their existence; and\r\nso they maintain the regal elevation over the awe-struck subjects of\r\ntheir interiors; who might otherwise revolt, pull down, scatter,\r\ndishonour, expose for a shallow fiction the holiest, the most vital to\r\nthem.  A democratic evil spirit is abroad, generated among congregations,\r\noften perilously communicating its wanton laughter to the desperate\r\nwickedness they know (not solely through the monition of Mr. Stuart Rem)\r\nto lurk within.  It has to be excluded: on certain points they must not\r\nthink.  The night of Tasso was darkly clouded in the minds of the pure\r\nladies: a rift would have seized their half-slumbering sense of smell,\r\nto revive the night, perhaps disorder the stately march of their\r\nintelligences.\r\n\r\nVictor's eloquence, Victor's influence, Victor's child he carried them as\r\na floodstream, insomuch, that their reception of this young creature of\r\nthe blot on her birth, was regarded by them in the unmentioned abstract,\r\nand the child's presence upon earth seen with the indulgence (without the\r\nnaughty curiosity) of the loyal moral English for the numerous offspring\r\nof the peccadillos of their monarchs.  These things pass muster from\r\nbeing 'Britannically cocooned in the purple,' says our irreverent\r\nsatirist; and the maiden ladies' passion of devotion to 'the blood'\r\nhelped to blind them; but still more so did the imperious urgency to\r\ncurtain closely the night of Tasso, throwing all its consequences upon\r\nVictor's masterful tongue.  Whence it ensued (and here is the danger for\r\nillogical individuals as well as vast communities, who continue to batten\r\nupon fiction when the convenience of it has taken the place of pleasure),\r\nthat they had need to exalt his eloquence, for a cloak to their conduct;\r\nand doing it, they fell into a habit of yielding to him; they\r\ndisintegrated under him; rules, principles, morality, were shaken to some\r\nconfusion.  And still proceeding thus, they now and then glanced back,\r\nmore wonderingly than convicted sinners upon their days of early\r\ninnocence, at the night when successfully they withstood him.  They who\r\nhad doubted of the rightness of letting Victor's girl come into collision\r\nwith two clerical gentlemen, one of whom was married, permitted him now\r\nto bring the Hon. Dudley Sowerby to their house, and make appointments\r\nto meet Mr. Dudley Sowerby under a roof that sheltered a young lady,\r\nevidently the allurement to the scion of aristocracy; of whose family Mr.\r\nStuart Rem had spoken in the very kindling hushed tones, proper to the\r\nunion of a sacerdotal and an English citizen's veneration.\r\n\r\nHow would it end?  And if some day this excellent Mr. Dudley Sowerby\r\nreproached them!  He could not have a sweeter bride, one more truly a\r\nlady in education and manners; but the birth! the child's name!  Their\r\ntrouble was emitted in a vapour of interjections.  Very perplexing was it\r\nfor the good ladies of strict principles to reflect, as dimly they did,\r\nthat the concrete presence of dear Nesta silenced and overcame objections\r\nto her being upon earth.  She seemed, as it were, a draught of\r\nredoubtable Nature inebriating morality.  But would others be similarly\r\naffected?  Victor might get his release, to do justice to the mother: it\r\nwould not cover the child.  Prize as they might the quality of the Radnor\r\nblood (drawn from the most ancient of original Britain's princes), there\r\nwas also the Cantor blood for consideration; and it was old, noble,\r\nproud.  Would it be satisfied in matching itself with great wealth,\r\na radiant health, and the good looks of a young flower?  For the sake\r\nof the dear girl, the ladies hoped that it would; and they enlarged the\r\noutline of their wedding present, while, in their minds, the noble\r\nEnglish family which could be satisfied so, was lowered, partaking\r\nof the taint they had personally ceased to recognize.\r\n\r\nOf one thing they were sure, and it enlisted them: the gentleman loved\r\nthe girl.  Her love of him, had it been prominent to view, would have\r\nstirred a feminine sigh; not more, except a feminine lecture to follow.\r\nShe was quite uninflamed, fresh and cool as a spring.  His ardour had no\r\ndisguise.  They measured him by the favourite fiction's heroes of their\r\nyouth, and found him to gaze, talk, comport himself, according to the\r\nprescription; correct grammar, finished sentences, all that is expected\r\nof a gentleman enamoured; and ever with the watchful intentness for his\r\nlady's faintest first dawn of an inclining to a wish.  Mr. Dudley\r\nSowerby's eye upon Nesta was really an apprentice.  There is in Love's\r\nyoung season a magnanimity in the male kind.  Their superior strength\r\nand knowledge are made subservient to the distaff of the weaker and\r\nshallower: they crown her queen; her look is their mandate.  So was it\r\nwhen Sir Charles and Sir Rupert and the estimable Villiers Davenant\r\ntouched maidenly hearts to throb: so is it now, with the Hon. Dudley\r\nSowerby.\r\n\r\nVery haltingly, the ladies were guilty of a suggestion to Victor.\r\n'Oh! Fredi?' said he; 'admires her, no doubt; and so do I, so we all do;\r\nshe's one of the nice girls; but as to Cupid's darts, she belongs to the\r\ncucumber family, and he shoots without fireing.  We shall do the mischief\r\nif we put an interdict.  Don't you remember the green days when obstacles\r\nwere the friction to light that match?'  Their pretty nod of assent\r\ndisplayed the virgin pride of the remembrance: they dreamed of having\r\nonce been exceedingly wilful; it refreshed their nipped natures; and\r\ndwelling on it, they forgot to press their suggestion.  Incidentally,\r\nhe named the sum his Fredi would convey to her husband; with, as was\r\ncalculable, the further amount his only child would inherit.  A curious\r\neffect was produced on them.  Though they were not imaginatively\r\nmercenary, as the creatures tainted with wealth commonly are, they talked\r\nof the sum over and over in the solitude of their chamber.  'Dukes have\r\nmarried for less.'  Such an heiress, they said, might buy up a\r\nPrincipality.  Victor had supplied them with something of an apology\r\nto the gentleman proposing to Nesta in their house.\r\n\r\nThe chronicle of it is, that Dudley Sowerby did this on the fifteenth day\r\nof September; and that it was not known to the damsel's parents before\r\nthe twenty-third; as they were away on an excursion in South Tyrol:--\r\naway, flown, with just a word of the hurried departure to their envious,\r\nexiled girl; though they did not tell her of new constructions at the\r\nLondon house partly causing them to fly.  Subject to their consent, she\r\nwrote, she had given hers.  The letter was telegramic on the essential\r\npoint.  She wrote of Mr. Barmby's having visited Mr. Posterley at the\r\nWells, and she put it just as flatly.  Her principal concern, to judge by\r\nher writing, was, to know what Mr. Durance had done, during her absence,\r\nwith the group of emissary-advocates of the various tongues of Europe on\r\nboard the steam-Liner conducting them the first stage of their journey to\r\nthe Court of Japan.\r\n\r\nMr. Simeon Fenellan had written his opinion, that all these delegates of\r\nthe different European nationalities were nothing other than dupes of a\r\nNew-York Syndicate of American Humorists, not without an eye on the\r\nmainchance; and he was sure they would be set to debate publicly, before\r\nan audience of high-priced tickets, in the principal North American\r\nCities, previous to the embarcation for Japan at San Francisco.  Mr.\r\nFenellan eulogized the immense astuteness of Dr. Gannius in taking his\r\ndaughter Delphica with him.  Dr. Gannius had singled forth poor Dr.\r\nBouthoin for the object of his attacks; but Nesta was chiefly anxious to\r\nhear of Delphica's proceedings; she was immensely interested in Delphica,\r\nand envied her; and the girl's funny speculations over the play of\r\nDelphica's divers arts upon the Greek, and upon the Russian, and upon the\r\nEnglish curate Mr. Semhians, and upon M. Falarique--set Gallically\r\npluming and crowing out of an Alsace-Lorraine growl--were clever.  Only,\r\nin such a letter, they were amazing.\r\n\r\nNataly received it at Campiglio, when about to start for an excursion\r\ndown the Sarca Valley to Arco.  Her letter of reply was delayed.  One to\r\nVictor from Dudley Sowerby, awaited them, on their return.  'Confirms\r\nFredi,' he said, showing it, and praising it as commendable, properly\r\nfervid.  She made pretence to read, she saw the words.\r\n\r\nHer short beat of wings was over.  She had joined herself with Victor's\r\nleap for a change, thirsting for the scenery of the white peaks in\r\nheaven, to enjoy through his enjoyment, if her own capacity was dead:\r\nand she had found it revive, up to some recovery of her old songful\r\nreadiness for invocations of pleasure.  Escape and beauty beckoned ahead;\r\nbehind were the chains.  These two letters of the one fact plucked her\r\nback.  The chained body bore the fluttering spirit: or it was the spirit\r\nin bonds, that dragged the body.  Both were abashed before the image of\r\nher girl.  Out of the riddle of her strange Nesta, one thing was clear:\r\nshe did not love the man: and Nataly tasted gladness in that, from the\r\ncup of poisonous regrets at the thought.  Her girl's heart would not be\r\nbroken.  But if he so strongly loved her, as to hold to this engagement?\r\n.  .  .  It might then be worse.  She dropped a plumb-line into the young\r\nman, sounding him by what she knew of him and judged.  She had to revert\r\nto Nesta's charm, for the assurance of his anchored attachment.\r\n\r\nHer holiday took the burden of her trouble, and amid the beauty of a\r\ndisenchanted scene, she resumed the London incubus.\r\n\r\n'You told him of her being at the Wells? in the neighbourhood, Victor?'\r\n\r\n'Didn't you know, my dear, the family-seat is Cronidge, two miles out\r\nfrom the Wells?--and particularly pretty country.'\r\n\r\n'I had forgotten, if I ever heard.  You will not let him be in\r\nignorance?'\r\n\r\n'My dear love, you are pale about it.  This is a matter between men.\r\nI write, thanking for the honour and so forth; and I appoint an\r\ninterview; and I show him my tablets.  He must be told, necessarily.\r\nIncidents of this kind come in their turn.  If Dudley does not account\r\nhimself the luckiest young fellow in the kingdom, he's not worthy of his\r\ngood fortune.  I wish they were both here now, honeymooning among these\r\npeaks, seeing the crescent over one, as we did last night!'\r\n\r\n'Have you an idea, in reading Nesta's letter?'\r\n\r\n'Seems indifferent?--mere trick to hide the blushes.  And I, too, I'm\r\ninterested in Delphica.  Delphica and Falarique will be fine stage\r\nbusiness.  Of course, Dr. Bouthoin and his curate!--we know what Old\r\nEngland has to expect from Colney.'\r\n\r\n'At any rate, Mr. Durance hurts no one.  You will, in your letter,\r\nappoint the day of the interview?'\r\n\r\n'Hurts himself!  Yes, dearest; appoint for--ten days homeward--eleventh\r\nday from to-day.  And you to Fredi: a bit of description--as you can,\r\nmy Nataly!  Happy to be a dolomite, to be painted by Nataly's pen.'\r\n\r\nThe sign is evil, when we have a vexatious ringing in the ear of some\r\nsmall piece of familiar domestic chatter, and subject it to scrutiny,\r\nhang on it, worry and magnify it.  What will not creatures under sway of\r\nthe sensational life, catch at to emphasize and strengthen distaste,\r\nuntil distaste shall have a semblance of reason, in the period of the\r\nmind's awakening to revolt!  Nataly shrank from the name of dolomite,\r\ndetested the name, though the scenes regained their beauty or something\r\nof it beneath her showery vision.  Every time Victor spoke of dolomites\r\non the journey homeward, she had at heart an accusation of her cowardice,\r\nher duplicity, frailty, treachery to the highest of her worship and sole\r\nsupport of her endurance in the world: not much blaming him: but the\r\ndegrading view of herself sank them both.  On a shifty soil, down goes\r\nthe idol.  For him she could plead still, for herself she could not.\r\n\r\nThe smell of the Channel brine inspirited her sufficiently to cast off\r\nthe fit and make it seem, in the main, a bodily depression; owing to\r\ncauses, of which she was beginning to have an apprehensive knowledge: and\r\nthey were not so fearful to her as the gloom they displaced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nETEXT EDITOR'S BOOKMARKS:\r\n\r\nBelief in the narrative by promoting nausea in the audience\r\nClaim for equality puts an end to the priceless privileges\r\nConsent to take life as it is\r\nDialogue between  Nature and Circumstance\r\nDudley was not gifted to read behind words and looks\r\nExuberant anticipatory trustfulness\r\nFell to chatting upon the nothings agreeably and seriously\r\nGreater our successes, the greater the slaves we become\r\nHe never explained\r\nHow Success derides Ambition!\r\nIf only been intellectually a little flexible in his morality\r\nNaturally as deceived as he wished to be\r\nOfficial wrath at sound of footfall or a fancied one\r\nOptional marriages, broken or renewed every seven years\r\nPessimy is invulnerable\r\nRepeatedly, in contempt of the disgust of iteration\r\nSatirist is an executioner by profession\r\nSemblance of a tombstone lady beside her lord\r\nThe banquet to be fervently remembered, should smoke\r\nThe homage we pay him flatters us\r\nWe must have some excuse, if we would keep to life\r\n\r\n\r\n[The End]",
