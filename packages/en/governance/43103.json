Then it knows.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco during the Ruef-Schmitz regime was no more under the heel\r\nof the \"System\" than when other \"bosses\" dominated; no more so than\r\nto-day; no more so than other communities have been and are.\r\n\r\nThe political \"boss\" is merely the visible sign of the \"System's\"\r\nexistence. However powerful he may appear, he is, after all, but agent\r\nfor the \"System.\" The \"boss\" develops power, does the \"System's\" work\r\nuntil he is repudiated by the people, when another \"boss,\" usually in\r\nthe name of \"reform,\" takes his place.\r\n\r\nBut the second \"boss\" serves the same \"System.\" Ruef entered San\r\nFrancisco politics as a \"reformer.\" He supplanted other \"bosses.\" But\r\nRuef in his turn served the \"System\" they had served.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, when Ruef had reached his point of greatest possible\r\npower, rose against him. The \"System\" was not immediately concerned.\r\nRuef had lived his day; the hour for another \"boss\" to succeed him had\r\ncome. But San Francisco proposed to get at those back of the \"boss\"; to\r\nget at the \"System.\" And then San Francisco found the \"System\" more\r\npowerful than herself; more powerful than the State of California.\r\n\r\nAnd San Francisco was beaten down, humiliated, made to understand that\r\nwithin her borders the laws could not be enforced against those to whom\r\nthe \"System\" granted immunity from punishment.\r\n\r\nTo secure evidence against bribe-givers, the State granted immunity to\r\nbribe-takers who confessed their crimes and joined with the State to\r\nbring larger criminals to justice. And the \"System's\" agents cried\r\noutrage that bribe-takers should go free of punishment.\r\n\r\nBut the \"System\" granted immunity from punishment to those who had\r\nbribed. And the apologists for the \"System\" will tolerate no criticism\r\nof this sort of immunity.\r\n\r\nOther communities have risen against the \"System's\" agents, the\r\n\"bosses,\" and the \"bosses\" have given place to other agents. But few\r\ncommunities, if any, have attacked the \"System\" as did San Francisco.\r\nHad they done so, unquestionably they would have found themselves as\r\nineffective against corruption as San Francisco has been shown to be.\r\n\r\nThe \"System\" is confined to no particular State or locality; it\r\npermeates our entire public life. Judge Lindsey in Colorado calls it\r\n\"The Beast.\" In California we call it \"The Southern Pacific Machine,\"\r\nfor in California the Southern Pacific Company was its chief\r\nbeneficiary. Other communities call it the \"Organization.\" The bull does\r\nnot discover his rope until he strains at it; the community knows little\r\nor nothing of the overpowering \"System\" until it resists. San Francisco\r\nresisted and discovered.\r\n\r\nThe mere bribing of a board of supervisors was not extraordinary. Our\r\nnewspapers furnish us daily with sorry recital of bribe-taking public\r\nofficials discovered in other communities. But the effective, searching\r\nresistance to bribe-giving which San Francisco offered was\r\nextraordinary. It was a new thing in American politics. It compelled the\r\n\"System\" to show its real strength, and that, too, was new in American\r\npolitics, and extraordinary, also.\r\n\r\nThe \"System\" at San Francisco had taken the usual precautions which\r\nordinarily ensure it against successful opposition, or even question. It\r\nhad, through its agents, selected the candidates for public office,\r\nincluding the District Attorney. With the District Attorney loyal to the\r\n\"System\" the \"System\" was secure against attack. And even were the\r\nDistrict Attorney to resist the \"System,\" still was the \"System\" secure,\r\nfor the \"System\" could deny the District Attorney, through the public\r\nofficials it controlled, the funds necessary for successful opposition.\r\n\r\nBut here again extraordinary circumstances worked for the \"System's\"\r\nconfusion. Not only had the \"System\" been mistaken in the caliber of the\r\nman whom it had permitted to be nominated for District Attorney, but\r\npatriotic citizens guaranteed the expenses of effective attack through\r\nthe District Attorney's office.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the \"System\" would ordinarily have been able to laugh at\r\nthe attack, and render it abortive, by compelling the citizens who were\r\nbacking the District Attorney to withdraw their support.\r\n\r\nEven at San Francisco, the supporters of the District Attorney felt the\r\nforce of such attack. Those who supported the Prosecution found\r\nthemselves harassed in their business ventures, and snubbed in the\r\nsocial circles in which they had moved. When Heney, stricken down in the\r\ndischarge of his duty, lay at the point of death, a minister of the\r\ngospel prayed for the wounded Prosecutor's recovery. Immediately from\r\nthe pews came silent expression of disapproval. That pastor refused to\r\nbe intimidated, refused to join with his fashionable congregation\r\nagainst the Prosecution. He was eventually compelled to resign his\r\npastorate. Rudolph Spreckels, while accounting for every dollar that the\r\nGraft Prosecution had expended, asked to be excused from naming those\r\nwho had subscribed to the fund, lest they be attacked. Ordinarily, those\r\ncitizens whose instincts had led them to guarantee the District Attorney\r\ntheir support, would have been forced to abandon him.\r\n\r\nBut at San Francisco, a few citizens, in spite of ridicule, abuse,\r\nsocial ostracism and business opposition, stood firm for civic\r\nrighteousness. This made San Francisco's attack upon the \"System\"\r\npossible and stirred the \"System\" to extraordinary resistance.\r\n\r\nThe \"System,\" seeing itself threatened, went to the relief of the\r\n\"boss,\" its agent, whom even its chief beneficiaries despised. The\r\n\"boss,\" through his puppet in the Mayor's chair, declared the office of\r\nthe District Attorney vacant, and appointed himself to fill the vacancy.\r\nThe boldness of the move startled the whole community. But the act\r\nmerely demonstrated the extremes to which the \"System\" was prepared to\r\ngo. It was not extraordinary in comparison with what was to follow.\r\nLater on, witnesses were to be concealed, intimidated, gotten out of the\r\nState; their kidnaping even being attempted. The managing editor of a\r\nnewspaper opposing the \"System\" was to be taken on the street in\r\ndaylight, hurried across the country to a suburban town, forced into a\r\nstateroom of an outgoing train, and sent on his way to a distant city.\r\nThe home of the pivotal witness against the \"System\"-protected\r\ndefendants was to be dynamited, the witness and other inmates of the\r\nbuilding miraculously escaping with their lives. A public prosecutor\r\nwas, while conducting one of the \"System\"-attacking trials, to be\r\nshot down in open court. A prisoner at the bar was to arise to denounce\r\nthe judge on the bench as a partisan and a scoundrel. Thugs were\r\nto invade court-rooms while trials were going on, to intimidate\r\n\"System\"-threatening prosecutors and witnesses; men were to be trapped\r\nas they offered bribes to trial jurors; agents of the Prosecution were\r\nto be bribed to turn over to the defending element the Prosecution's\r\npapers and reports. An agent of the Prosecution in the employ of the\r\nDefense, working in the interest of the Defense, was to sit at the\r\nProsecutor's side during the selection of a trial jury, to advise the\r\nProsecutor of the character of the men under examination for jurors, and\r\nwith such advice mislead and confuse.\r\n\r\nNo; bribe-giving at San Francisco was not so extraordinary as the events\r\nwhich grew out of attempt to punish for bribe-giving.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as we look upon San Francisco beaten, and retarded in her\r\ndevelopment because of that beating, the hopelessness of her opposition\r\nto the \"System\" is the most startling thing of all. We see now, that\r\nwith a District Attorney intent upon doing his duty, with funds ample\r\nfor vigorous prosecution guaranteed, with trial judges of integrity and\r\nability on the bench, none of the accused, so long as he remained loyal\r\nto the \"System\"--so long as he did not \"snitch\"--was in real danger of\r\nsuffering the law-provided punishment for the crimes uncovered against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nRuef carefully weighed the ability of the Prosecution to save him,\r\nagainst the power of the \"System\" to punish or to save, and knowing the\r\npower of the \"System\" as few other men knew it, Ruef betrayed the\r\nProsecution and cast his lot with the \"System.\" The outcome would have\r\njustified his judgment but for a series of unusual events which none\r\ncould have foreseen. The most extraordinary incident of the whole Graft\r\nProsecution, we can now, with the \"System\" uncovered before us, see, was\r\nthat Abe Ruef went to the penitentiary. With full knowledge of the\r\npower, resources and methods of the \"System,\" it is not at all\r\nextraordinary that guilty men under its protection should escape\r\npunishment. But it is extraordinary--due only to a chain of\r\nextraordinary happenings--that one of its agents, who continued\r\nfaithful, who didn't \"snitch,\" finds himself in prison and unable to get\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco Graft Prosecution uncovered the \"System\" as it has\r\nbeen uncovered in no other American city, for San Francisco made the\r\nhardest, most persistent, and longest continued attack that a\r\nmunicipality has ever made upon it. California has profited greatly\r\nbecause of the uncovering, for while uncovered, the \"System\" may be\r\nproceeded against intelligently, not in the courts, but at the\r\nballot-box. California has been quick to profit by the opportunity which\r\nthe uncovering of the \"System\" has offered.\r\n\r\nIn preparing this volume for the press it is my purpose--so far as lies\r\nin my power to do so--_to keep the cover off_.\r\n\r\n                                                  _FRANKLIN HICHBORN._\r\n\r\nSanta Clara, Calif., Dec. 25, 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                   THE UNION LABOR PARTY MOVEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nEugene E. Schmitz[1] was elected Mayor of San Francisco in November,\r\n1901. He had been nominated by the Union-Labor party. This party was\r\norganized after labor disturbances which had divided San Francisco into\r\nmilitant factions, with organized labor on the one side and organized\r\ncapital on the other.[2]\r\n\r\nThe convention which had nominated Schmitz was made up in the main of\r\ndelegates who had affiliations with labor unions and were in close\r\nsympathy with the labor-union movement.\r\n\r\nBut this did not mean that the new party had the unanimous approval of\r\nthe labor unions, or of the rank and file of organized labor. A\r\nconsiderable faction, with P. H. McCarthy, president of the State\r\nBuilding Trades Council, even then a dominating figure in San Francisco\r\nlabor circles, at its head, advised against the movement, and opposed\r\nthe new party candidates not only in 1901, but in 1903 when Schmitz was\r\na candidate for re-election.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the new party had in the beginning the support of the\r\nCoast Seamen's Journal, published at San Francisco, and one of the most\r\ninfluential labor publications on the Pacific Coast. It had, too, the\r\nadvocacy of several earnest Labor leaders.\r\n\r\nVery frankly, such leaders questioned the ultimate consequences of the\r\nmovement, expressing fears which time was to justify. But to them the\r\nsituation offered no alternative. Their support and influence went to\r\nthe new party as an expedient of the times, not as the beginning of a\r\npermanent political organization.\r\n\r\nBut the movement, once started, got beyond their control. During the\r\nfirst five years of Union-Labor party activities in San Francisco many\r\nof these original supporters were forced, first into silence and finally\r\ninto open repudiation of the methods of the Union-Labor party\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, members of the McCarthy faction, which had resisted the\r\norganization of the party, and had opposed it at the 1901 and 1903\r\nelections, became its strong partisans. This element supported the party\r\nticket at the 1905 election; and in 1907, and again in 1909, when\r\nMcCarthy was himself the Union-Labor party candidate for Mayor.\r\n\r\nBut the Union-Labor party ticket which McCarthy headed did not have the\r\nunited support of labor leaders who had organized the movement. Indeed,\r\nlabor leaders whom the McCarthy faction in 1901 called \"scabs\" for\r\norganizing the Union-Labor party, were, by the same men who had\r\ncondemned them in 1901, denounced as \"scabs\" during the 1909 campaign\r\nfor not supporting the Union-Labor party candidates.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, the Union-Labor party had the support of elements\r\noutside the labor-union movement. Much of this support came from\r\ncitizens who, regardless of their attitude on trade-unionism, were\r\ndissatisfied with the old parties. The situation offered exceptional\r\nopportunity for the political manipulator. But the one man with the\r\npolitical vision to see the possibilities of the third-party movement,\r\nwas not a member of a labor union. He was a lawyer who had already\r\nattained some prominence in San Francisco politics--Abraham Ruef.[3]\r\n\r\nRuef was quick to see the potentialities of the political Frankenstein\r\nwhich groping labor leaders had brought into being. He knew that _they_\r\ncould not control their creation; he knew that _he_ could. He did not\r\noverestimate his powers. He managed the new party's 1901 campaign.[4]\r\nUnder his direction, success was won for a cause that had been deemed\r\nhopeless. The genius of Abraham Ruef made Eugene E. Schmitz Mayor of San\r\nFrancisco.[5]\r\n\r\nIn practical acknowledgment of Ruef's services, Schmitz issued an open\r\nletter, in which he stated himself privileged to consider Ruef his\r\nfriendly counsellor.[6] The issuance of that letter made Ruef the\r\nrecognized political representative of the Union-Labor party\r\nadministration, a position which he held until the estrangement of\r\nhimself and Schmitz under the strain of the graft prosecution.[7]\r\n\r\nBut the government of San Francisco did not pass entirely under control\r\nof the Union-Labor party until four years after Schmitz's elevation to\r\nthe Mayoralty.\r\n\r\nDuring the era of Union-Labor party power in San Francisco, the Mayor\r\nand the eighteen members of the Board of Supervisors were elected every\r\ntwo years.[8] Schmitz, under Ruef's management, was re-elected in 1903.\r\nBut the Union-Labor party failed at that election, as it had in 1901,\r\nto elect a majority of the Board of Supervisors. Many of the\r\ncommissions, on the other hand, through appointments by the mayor, had,\r\nby 1903, passed completely under Union-Labor party control.\r\n\r\nGradually, the opinion grew in San Francisco that the management of the\r\ndepartments was unsatisfactory, if not corrupt. This opinion, in 1905,\r\nwhen Schmitz was for a third time the Union-Labor party candidate for\r\nMayor, found expression in fusion of the Republican and Democratic\r\nparties to bring about the defeat of the Union-Labor party nominees.\r\n\r\nThis fusion was in the name of municipal reform. The organizers of the\r\nmovement were in the main opposed to machine political methods. When,\r\nhowever, the movement gave evidence of vitality and strength, the\r\npolitical agents of public service corporations became identified with\r\nits leadership.[9] The new leaders were soon in practical control.\r\nPublic-service corporations were largely instrumental in financing the\r\nmovement. Testimony was brought out before the Grand Jury which\r\nconducted the graft investigations, that nearly every public-service\r\ncorporation in San Francisco contributed to the fusion fund, the\r\naverage of the contributions being $2,500 for each corporation.[10]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the public-service corporations contributed liberally\r\ntoward the election of the Ruef-backed, Union-Labor party\r\ncandidates.[11] Ruef was already on the pay-roll of the law departments\r\nof many of them. Thus, generally speaking, it made little difference to\r\nthe corporations whether the \"reform\" fusion candidates or the Ruef\r\nUnion-Labor party candidates were elected. The corporations had\r\ncaptained each side, and in a large measure had financed each side.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable difficulties of a campaign, financed and officered by\r\npublic-service corporations, to correct municipal ills for which the\r\ncorporations were in large measure responsible, were encountered from\r\nthe beginning. For the head of the reform or fusion ticket, men who had\r\nbeen prominent in the organization of the anti-Ruef crusade were\r\nsuggested, only to be rejected by the corporation allies who had after\r\nthe reform group's preliminary successes become identified with the\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nFinally, after several names had been canvassed, John S. Partridge, an\r\nattorney of good ability, and repute, but scarcely known outside the\r\nimmediate circle in which he moved, was agreed upon as Mr. Schmitz's\r\nopponent. Both the Democrat and the Republican party nominated Mr.\r\nPartridge, and with him a complete fusion ticket, including supervisors.\r\n\r\nPartridge had a clear field against Schmitz, but his candidacy failed to\r\ncarry the confidence, or to awake the enthusiasm which brings success at\r\nthe polls.\r\n\r\nThe Union-Labor administration was openly denounced as corrupt. Francis\r\nJ. Heney,[12] fresh from his success in prosecuting the Oregon land\r\nfraud cases, went so far as to declare in a speech before one of the\r\nlargest political gatherings ever assembled in San Francisco that he\r\nknew Ruef to be corrupt,[13] and, given opportunity, could prove it.\r\n\r\nThe public generally believed Heney's charges to be justified. But of\r\napproximately 98,000 registered voters only 68,878 voted for Mayor, and\r\nof these, 40,191 voted for Schmitz. Partridge received only 28,687[14]\r\nvotes, being defeated by a majority of 11,504.\r\n\r\nNot only was Schmitz re-elected by overwhelming majority, but the entire\r\nRuef-selected Union-Labor party ticket was elected with him.\r\n\r\nRuef, as Mayor Schmitz's recognized political adviser, and political\r\nagent for the Union-Labor party, found himself in control of every\r\nbranch and department of the San Francisco municipal government.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [1] Schmitz, previous to his election, was employed as a musician in\r\n     a San Francisco theater. His connection with organized labor\r\n     came through membership in the Musicians' Union. He had no\r\n     intention of aspiring to the Mayor's chair until Ruef suggested\r\n     it to him.\r\n\r\n [2] The San Francisco labor strike of 1901 arose out of the refusal\r\n     of the organized teamsters to deliver goods to a non-union\r\n     express agency. The Employers' Association refused to treat with\r\n     the men collectively. Other organizations went out in sympathy.\r\n\r\n     James D. Phelan, who was then Mayor, was the intermediary\r\n     between the teamsters and their employees. He advocated\r\n     recognition. The negotiations failed. During the progress of the\r\n     strike there were constant disturbances. A steamship company,\r\n     for example, employed prizefighters in the guise of workingmen\r\n     to seek positions as strikebreakers, and when interfered with to\r\n     belabor the pickets. Assaults were made upon non-union teamsters\r\n     carrying supplies to and from railway stations. The Chief of\r\n     Police, in order to preserve peaceful traffic, placed two\r\n     policemen upon each truck. Labor leaders asked not only that the\r\n     police be withdrawn from the trucks, but from the waterfront.\r\n     This action the Mayor refused to take, on the ground that it was\r\n     his duty to preserve public order, and that it was in the\r\n     interest of all to avert rather than suppress trouble. A meeting\r\n     of representatives of the several factions was held at the\r\n     Mayor's office, September 23, 1901. The story was circulated\r\n     that the Mayor had said at the meeting that if the workmen did\r\n     not want to be clubbed let them go to work. Both sides now admit\r\n     the statement was not made. Joseph S. Tobin, Henry U.\r\n     Brandenstein, Lawrence J. Dwyer and Peter J. Curtis, who were\r\n     present, have set forth in affidavit that \"Mayor Phelan did not\r\n     say at said conference, as has been alleged, referring to the\r\n     workingmen's strike, that 'if they don't want to be clubbed let\r\n     them go to work,' nor did he make any statement of like import.\"\r\n     At the time, however, feeling was running so high at San\r\n     Francisco that the most extravagant stories were believed.\r\n     Opponents of the administration--those representing capital as\r\n     well as those advocating recognition of the unions--seized upon\r\n     every opportunity to discredit. Crafty adventurers of the type\r\n     of Abe Ruef lost no chance to work distrust and confusion. Out\r\n     of the turmoil came the Union Labor party.\r\n\r\n [3] Ruef graduated from the University of California and from the\r\n     University of California law school with exceptional honors. He\r\n     was at twenty-one a practicing attorney. With Franklin K. Lane,\r\n     the present Secretary of the Interior, Dean John H. Wigmore of\r\n     the Northwestern University, and others, he organized a club for\r\n     civic reform. His first political convention, he tells us in his\r\n     Confessions, showed him that representative government was a\r\n     farce. He resolved to devote himself to his law practice. But\r\n     almost immediately we find him an \"errand boy\" for Martin Kelly\r\n     and Phil Crimmins, powerful \"bosses\" in their day, but now\r\n     practically forgotten. Ruef continued with Kelly and Crimmins\r\n     for ten years. He drifted with the machine, securing excellent\r\n     training for his future career. His opportunity came in 1901,\r\n     when, in its effort to throw off the yoke of the bosses, the\r\n     State secured the enactment of a new primary law. Under this law\r\n     Ruef took his first step to secure control of the State\r\n     political machine. He seized upon the new law as a vehicle to\r\n     organize a \"reform\" movement. His organization took the name\r\n     Republican Primary League. He secured a large following. He was\r\n     becoming powerful. He tells us in his Confessions that during\r\n     this period he was invited to dine at the homes of men of\r\n     political and social importance, among them William F. Herrin,\r\n     chief counsel of the Southern Pacific Company, and Patrick\r\n     Calhoun, president of the United Railroads. But as yet, Ruef had\r\n     little real influence in the \"organization.\" Then came the labor\r\n     unrest, and the Union Labor party movement. Ruef managed to\r\n     combine the Republican Primary League with the Union Labor party\r\n     movement. This combination was the basis of his campaign for the\r\n     election of Schmitz.\r\n\r\n [4] Ruef also provided much of the funds employed in the first\r\n     Schmitz campaign. In a statement published May 16, 1907, Ruef\r\n     said: \"When Schmitz first ran for Mayor I made his campaign for\r\n     him, and put up $16,000. My friends told me I was a fool. I\r\n     guess I was.\"\r\n\r\n [5] Out of the 52,168 votes cast for Mayor, at the 1901 election,\r\n     Schmitz received 21,776. His opponents--Wells (Republican) and\r\n     Tobin (Democrat)--divided 30,392 between them, Wells receiving\r\n     17,718 and Tobin 12,674. Up to the present time (1914) the\r\n     Union-Labor party has four times been successful in San\r\n     Francisco mayoralty elections. But only once, in 1905, has its\r\n     candidate been elected by majority vote. Changes in the San\r\n     Francisco Charter, ratified at the 1911 session of the State\r\n     Legislature, place the election of municipal officials on a\r\n     non-partisan basis, and prevent election by plurality vote.\r\n     Henceforth all officials must be elected by majority vote.\r\n\r\n [6] Schmitz's letter announcing his obligation to Ruef was as\r\n     follows:\r\n\r\n     \"My Dear Ruef: Now that the election is over and I am to be\r\n     the Mayor of our native city, I wish to express to you and\r\n     through you to all your loyal friends and the faithful\r\n     Republicans who supported my cause, my profound appreciation\r\n     of the generous, whole-souled, substantial and effective\r\n     support accorded me in the exciting campaign which has just\r\n     closed. Viewed from your prominent position in the Republican\r\n     party, I know the seriousness of the step which you took when\r\n     you voluntarily and unconditionally offered me your valuable\r\n     aid, and I cannot in words properly give utterance to my deep\r\n     feeling in this regard. I can only say that your action is\r\n     worthy of yourself, and that no higher praise can be accorded\r\n     you.\r\n\r\n     \"I have now for some fifteen years enjoyed your acquaintance\r\n     and friendship and your services as my attorney in many\r\n     capacities, and I say without hesitation or flattery that I\r\n     have yet to find a more honorable, a more loyal, a more able\r\n     attorney, or a truer friend.\r\n\r\n     \"I feel that I owe a great deal of my success in this\r\n     campaign to you and your friends, and I shall not permit\r\n     myself at any time to forget it.\r\n\r\n     \"Though you have never asked or even suggested it, I shall,\r\n     with the utmost confidence and with a sentiment of absolute\r\n     security, feel myself privileged at all times to consider you\r\n     as my friendly counsellor and to call upon you whenever I may\r\n     require assistance in the solution of any of the perplexing\r\n     and complicated questions which must necessarily arise in the\r\n     conduct of so vast and important an office.\r\n\r\n     \"I trust that you will not hesitate to say that I may do so.\r\n     Again and again thanking you and your friends, I am,\r\n\r\n                                        \"Very sincerely yours,\r\n                                                     \"E. E. SCHMITZ.\"\r\n\r\n [7] Ruef at once availed himself of the opportunities which his\r\n     position offered. He accepted regular \"retainers\" from\r\n     public-service corporations. He testified before the Grand Jury\r\n     that he was employed by the United Railroads through Tirey L.\r\n     Ford, just after the first election of Schmitz, at $500 per\r\n     month, and that he gave receipts to Ford for this money, during\r\n     Schmitz's first term of office, but received the money always in\r\n     Ford's office in currency; but that after the second election of\r\n     Schmitz, he (Ruef) refused to give any more receipts for this\r\n     money, although he continued to receive it from Ford the same as\r\n     before with receipts, and that after the third election his\r\n     salary was increased to $1,000 per month, which was paid in the\r\n     same way by Ford without any receipts.\r\n\r\n     Ruef further testified that he was employed by the Pacific\r\n     States Telephone and Telegraph Company, immediately after\r\n     Schmitz's first election, through T. V. Halsey, and that Halsey\r\n     paid him $1,200 per month in currency without any receipt.\r\n\r\n     E. S. Pillsbury, general counsel of the Pacific States Telephone\r\n     and Telegraph Company, testified that he never heard of Ruef's\r\n     employment until after the indictments were returned against\r\n     Halsey, and that he, Pillsbury, attended to all of the legal\r\n     business of the company during the entire time Ruef was under\r\n     employment. Pillsbury received only $1,000 per month for his own\r\n     services, and testified that he would have objected to the\r\n     payment to Ruef of a larger salary than he was getting.\r\n\r\n     Pillsbury was a stockholder to the amount of $500,000 in his own\r\n     right, and was a member of the executive committee of the board\r\n     of directors of the company.\r\n\r\n     At the trial of The People vs. Tirey L. Ford, No. 817, I. W.\r\n     Hellman, one of the most prominent of California bankers and at\r\n     one time a director of the United Railroads, testified: \"Some\r\n     five years ago (the Ford trial was in 1907, which would make the\r\n     date about 1902) Mr. Holland, who was then the president of the\r\n     United Railways, came to me to ask my advice whether Mr. Ruef\r\n     should be employed as an attorney for the United Railways,\r\n     stating that by employing him peace could be secured with the\r\n     labor unions, that he had great influence with them, and there\r\n     would be general peace, and it was to the benefit of the\r\n     railways company to have such peace. Mr. Ruef then was an\r\n     attorney of high repute, recognized as a good lawyer, and I said\r\n     if that could be accomplished it would be for the benefit of the\r\n     railway company as well as for the public, and I advised yes.\r\n     Whether he has been employed or not I do not know, because I\r\n     afterward sold my interest in the company and I never have\r\n     inquired whether he had been employed or not.\"\r\n\r\n     In this connection, it is interesting to note that Ruef in his\r\n     latest confession, the publication of which was begun in the San\r\n     Francisco Bulletin in May, 1912, states that his employment by\r\n     corporations as attorney did not begin until after the second\r\n     Schmitz election--that is to say, in 1903. Hellman's testimony\r\n     would indicate that his employment by the United Railroads dates\r\n     from 1902. Compare with footnote 77, page 74.\r\n\r\n [8] Under amendments to the San Francisco Charter, ratified by the\r\n     Legislature of 1911, the Mayor and Supervisors are now elected\r\n     to four-year terms.\r\n\r\n [9] George F. Hatton, Southern Pacific lobbyist and politician, and\r\n     political manager for United States Senator George C. Perkins,\r\n     was one of the principal leaders of the 1905 \"reform\" movement.\r\n     He was at one time retained as an attorney by the Empire\r\n     Construction Company, affiliated with the Home Telephone\r\n     Company, which was seeking a franchise to establish a telephone\r\n     system in San Francisco in competition with the Pacific States\r\n     Telephone and Telegraph Company. The Home Telephone Company\r\n     contributed to the \"reform\" campaign fund. Through the \"reform\"\r\n     Board of Supervisors, who were to be elected, and whose campaign\r\n     was thus financed, the Home Company was to get its franchise.\r\n     But the \"reform\" candidates were defeated, the Schmitz-Ruef\r\n     Union-Labor party candidates were elected. The Home Telephone\r\n     Company thereupon proceeded to secure its franchise by employing\r\n     Ruef.\r\n\r\n [10] William Thomas, of the law firm of Thomas, Gerstle & Frick,\r\n      attorneys for the Home Telephone Company, testified before the\r\n      Grand Jury that his company had contributed $8,000 to the\r\n      \"reform\" campaign fund. The testimony indicated that this money\r\n      was used at the primaries. Louis Sloss, one of the leaders of\r\n      the \"reform\" movement, testified that after the primaries,\r\n      Detweiler, who was at the head of the Home Telephone Company\r\n      enterprise, sent his personal check for $800 additional.\r\n      Fairfax H. Wheelan, one of the leaders of the \"reform\"\r\n      movement, testified before the Grand Jury that the Pacific\r\n      States Telephone and Telegraph Company, in the name of T. V.\r\n      Halsey, subscribed $2,000 to the fund; and the United\r\n      Railroads, concealing its identity under the name \"Cash,\"\r\n      $2,000 more.\r\n\r\n [11] Dr. Charles Boxton was one of the Union-Labor party Supervisors\r\n      elected in 1905. At the second trial of Louis Glass,\r\n      vice-president of the Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph\r\n      Company, for bribery, Boxton testified that during the\r\n      campaign, T. V. Halsey, political agent for the company, met\r\n      him on the street and gave him a sealed envelope, saying: \"If\r\n      that will be of any use to you use it.\"\r\n\r\n      Boxton found the envelope to contain $1,000 in United States\r\n      currency.\r\n\r\n [12] Francis J. Heney when five years old went to San Francisco with\r\n      his parents. He was educated at the public schools of that\r\n      city, the University of California, and Hastings Law School.\r\n      After being admitted to practice he lived for a time in\r\n      Arizona, where he served as Attorney-General. On his return to\r\n      San Francisco in 1895, he confined himself to civil practice\r\n      until, at the solicitation of United States Attorney-General\r\n      Knox, he undertook the prosecution of the Oregon Land Fraud\r\n      cases. He was at the close of successful prosecution of these\r\n      cases, when invited by Rudolph Spreckels, Phelan and others, to\r\n      participate in the prosecution of the San Francisco graft\r\n      cases.\r\n\r\n [13] Heney's statement was prophetic. The published account of his\r\n      speech (see Chronicle, November 6, 1905) was as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"If I had control of the District Attorney's office, I would\r\n      indict Abe Ruef for felony and send him to the penitentiary,\r\n      where he belongs, for I have personal knowledge that he is\r\n      corrupt.\r\n\r\n      \"If you elect these people, the graft of this city will become\r\n      so great that the citizens of San Francisco will ask me to come\r\n      back and prosecute him. When the time comes I will do as the\r\n      people request as a matter of civic duty.\"\r\n\r\n      Heney's charge brought caustic reply from Ruef. In an open\r\n      letter to Heney, published November 7, 1905, Ruef said:\r\n\r\n      \"Francis J. Heney:--In the published reports of your speech at\r\n      Mechanics Pavilion last Saturday night you are represented as\r\n      saying: 'I say to you, moreover, that I personally know that\r\n      Abraham Ruef is corrupt, and I say to you that whenever he\r\n      wants me to prove it in court I will do so.'\r\n\r\n      \"I am not a candidate for office, but as a man I do not propose\r\n      to leave your false statement undenied.\r\n\r\n      \"In the past I have paid little attention to anything said by\r\n      hostile papers concerning myself, feeling that the public fully\r\n      understood the despicable motives underlying the utterances of\r\n      their proprietors. In your case a different situation presents\r\n      itself. You have recently acquired considerable repute as a\r\n      prosecuting attorney for the United States Government. Your\r\n      statements, if unchallenged, may be given some credence by\r\n      those not familiar with the true condition of affairs.\r\n\r\n      \"In making the statement that you personally know that I am\r\n      corrupt you lied. You cannot personally know that which does\r\n      not exist.\r\n\r\n      \"In making the statement at a time and place which allowed no\r\n      opportunity for a legal showing before the date of the election\r\n      which you seek to influence, you showed the same courage which\r\n      put a bullet into the body of Dr. J. C. Handy of Tucson, Ariz.,\r\n      in 1891, for whose killing you were indicted for murder, and\r\n      upon trial were acquitted because you were the only witness to\r\n      the deed.\r\n\r\n      \"You say whenever I want you to prove it in court you will do\r\n      so.\r\n\r\n      \"I want you to try to prove it, and at once. I demand that you\r\n      begin at once. I know you cannot prove what does not exist. Why\r\n      you should wait upon my desire, why you should depend upon my\r\n      wish to proceed with the performance of what must be to every\r\n      good citizen a public duty, I do not know.\r\n\r\n      \"But as you declare that you will proceed only with my consent,\r\n      I give you here and now full consent and authority to proceed,\r\n      and I go further and ask that you do so.\r\n\r\n      \"I regret that your recent identification with the Citizens'\r\n      Alliance and with the corporations anxious to encompass the\r\n      defeat of a candidate in a political campaign should have made\r\n      you so far forget the regard for truth, justice and decency\r\n      which should characterize men in our profession, as to have\r\n      induced you to take the chance of ruining for life the\r\n      reputation and standing of one who is not rightfully amenable\r\n      to your charge, and who has not otherwise heretofore given you\r\n      the slightest private or personal provocation for your savage\r\n      and mendacious attack.\r\n\r\n                                                  \"A. RUEF.\r\n      \"San Francisco, November 6th.\"\r\n\r\n [14] To hold that only 28,687 electors of San Francisco wished a\r\n      change in the administration of San Francisco would be unjust.\r\n      Many who were opposed to Ruef's domination remained away from\r\n      the polls, through dissatisfaction with the management of the\r\n      fusion movement. Of the more than 40,000 who voted for the\r\n      Union Labor ticket, were thousands of union men who were\r\n      opposed to the Schmitz-Ruef element. But Ruef cleverly injected\r\n      the Citizens' Alliance issue, and the organized labor element\r\n      was, because of this, made to vote practically solidly for the\r\n      Ruef-selected candidates. The fact that voting machines were\r\n      used in every precinct in San Francisco for the first time\r\n      contributed to this. Members of labor unions did not understand\r\n      the working of the machines, and were afraid to attempt to vote\r\n      anything but the straight ticket. This dissatisfied organized\r\n      labor element, two years later, contributed in no small degree\r\n      to the election of Mayor E. R. Taylor and the re-election of\r\n      District Attorney William H. Langdon, thereby making possible\r\n      continuation until 1910 of the graft prosecution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                    THE RUEF BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo observer of San Francisco politics, not even Ruef himself, had\r\nexpected the entire Union-Labor party ticket to be elected. The election\r\nof the Supervisors was the greatest surprise of all. Ruef, with his\r\npolitical intimates, had selected the Supervisorial candidates, but more\r\nwith a view to hold the organized labor vote for Schmitz than with idea\r\nof the fitness of the candidates for the duties involved in managing the\r\naffairs of a municipality of 500,000 population.[15] Not one of the\r\neighteen elected was a man of strong character.[16] Several were of\r\nfair, but by no means exceptional ability. Of this type were Gallagher,\r\nan attorney of some prominence who acted as go-between between Ruef and\r\nthe Supervisors; Wilson, who was a sort of second man to Gallagher, and\r\nBoxton, a dentist.\r\n\r\nBut for the most part they were men who had led uneventful lives as\r\ndrivers of delivery wagons, bartenders and clerks. Without an exception,\r\nthey saw in their unexpected elevation to the Board of Supervisors\r\nopportunity to better their condition. Some of them would not, perhaps,\r\nhave sought bribes; few of them knew just how they could employ their\r\noffice to their best advantage; but from the hour of their election the\r\nidea of personal advancement was uppermost in the minds of the majority\r\nof the members of the Schmitz-Ruef Board of Supervisors.[17] Their\r\nignorance of the requirements of their office, their failure to\r\nappreciate their large responsibilities, and above all their ill-defined\r\nambitions made them promise of easy prey for the agents of the\r\npublic-service corporations, who were playing for special privileges\r\nworth millions.\r\n\r\nNone realized this better than Ruef. From the beginning, he recognized\r\nthat the likelihood of individual members of the board yielding to\r\ntemptation to petty gain[18] threatened his own larger purposes. He let\r\nit be known that he would himself personally prosecute any one of them\r\nwhom he discovered to be \"grafting.\" Ruef was emphatic in his position\r\nthat the Supervisors should have no financial dealings with those\r\nseeking special-privilege advantages. He even defined regular procedure\r\nfor dealing with persons and corporations that might elect to catch the\r\neasiest way to accomplish their purposes by the use of bribe money. To\r\nthis end he arranged:\r\n\r\n(1) That Supervisor James L. Gallagher[19] should represent him on the\r\nboard. The Supervisors at once accepted Gallagher, and dealt with him\r\nas Ruef's recognized agent.\r\n\r\n(2) Finally Ruef arranged for a regular weekly caucus[20] to be held\r\neach Sunday night, on the eve of the regular meeting day of the board,\r\nMonday.\r\n\r\nThe public was not admitted to these caucuses. Those who were admitted\r\nwere Ruef, Mayor Schmitz, George B. Keane,[21] clerk of the Board of\r\nSupervisors, who also acted as secretary of the caucus, and the eighteen\r\nSupervisors.\r\n\r\nAt these meetings, which were held every Sunday evening, Ruef was the\r\ndominating figure. Supervisor Wilson, testifying at the graft trials,\r\nstated that Ruef took the position of \"chief counsel and adviser for the\r\nboard in matters that were to come before the board.\"\r\n\r\nKeane, as secretary of the caucus, took full notes[22] of the\r\nproceedings and sent written notices[23] of the meetings to each of\r\nthose who were admitted.\r\n\r\nThe first of these caucuses was held shortly before the Schmitz-Ruef\r\nboard took office. The organization of the board was provided by the\r\nSupervisors authorizing Ruef and Schmitz to make up the committees. Ruef\r\nundertook the task. He prepared the committee lists, and submitted his\r\nselections to Schmitz and Gallagher. Schmitz and Gallagher suggested\r\nunimportant changes. The committees were then announced to the\r\nSupervisors at the next caucus. There were objections raised, but these\r\nobjections, with one exception, were denied in all important\r\nparticulars. The organization of the Schmitz-Ruef Board of Supervisors\r\nwas thus perfected.\r\n\r\nRuef's way seemed clear. The committee organization of the Board of\r\nSupervisors was his own. The Supervisors were to hold no open meeting\r\nuntil they had met with him in secret caucus to ascertain his wishes.\r\nThe official clerk of the board, who was also secretary of the caucus,\r\nwas his tried henchman. Gallagher, the ablest of the Supervisors,\r\nflattered at being made his representative, and further bound by\r\nmercenary ties, was ready to do his slightest bidding. And never had\r\nentrenched boss more fruitful field for exploitation.\r\n\r\nBut scarcely had the new administration been installed, than a weak\r\npoint developed in Ruef's position. District Attorney William H.\r\nLangdon, who had been elected on the Ruef ticket, gave evidence that he\r\nproposed to enforce the law, regardless of the effect upon the\r\nadministration of which he was a part, or upon Ruef's plans and\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nThe first intimation the public had of Langdon's independent attitude\r\ncame when gambling games in which Ruef was popularly supposed to be\r\ninterested were raided under the personal direction of the District\r\nAttorney. Langdon had first attempted to close the places through the\r\npolice department. Failing, he had attended to the matter himself.[24]\r\nThe gamblers appealed to Ruef, but Ruef was helpless. Langdon would not\r\nbe turned from his purpose. The gamblers and capitalists interested in\r\ngambling establishments charged Langdon with political ingratitude.\r\n\r\nBut those who were laboring for the development, and were opposing the\r\nexploitation of San Francisco, saw in Langdon's course the first sign\r\nthat Abraham Ruef was not to have undisputed sway in San Francisco.[25]\r\nWith Langdon in the District Attorney's office it was still possible\r\nthat the laws could be enforced--even against Abraham Ruef. The raiding\r\nof the gambling dens marked the beginning of the division in San\r\nFrancisco, with those who approached the Ruef administration with bribe\r\nmoney on the one side, and those who resisted with the check of law\r\nenforcement on the other.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [15] At Ruef's trial for offering a bribe to Supervisor Furey,\r\n      Supervisor James L. Gallagher testified that conferences for\r\n      selecting the Union Labor party ticket, from Sheriff down, were\r\n      held at Ruef's office. Gallagher testified of one of these\r\n      conferences:\r\n\r\n      \"The matter of the nominees for Supervisors was mentioned, and all\r\n      that I recollect about it is that it was stated that there\r\n      should be a good representation of prominent Union-Labor men on\r\n      the ticket, and Mr. Ruef stated that he had that in mind, and\r\n      that that would be done, and it was also stated that the members\r\n      on the Board of Supervisors that were Union-Labor adherents\r\n      should be nominated.\" See The People vs. Abraham Ruef, No.\r\n      1437--Transcript on Appeal, Part 3, Vol. 3, page 1278.\r\n\r\n [16] The eighteen members of the Ruef-Schmitz Board of Supervisors\r\n      were James L. Gallagher, attorney at law; Cornelius J.\r\n      Harrigan, grocer; James T. Kelly, piano polisher; Thomas F.\r\n      Lonergan, driver of a bakery delivery wagon; Max Mamlock,\r\n      electrician; P. M. McGushin, saloonkeeper; F. P. Nicholas,\r\n      carpenter; Jennings J. Phillips, employed in newspaper\r\n      circulation department; L. A. Rea, painter; W. W. Sanderson,\r\n      employed in grocery store; E. I. Walsh, shoemaker; Andrew M.\r\n      Wilson, employing drayman; George Duffey, contracting plumber;\r\n      Charles Boxton, dentist; M. W. Coffey, hackman; Daniel G.\r\n      Coleman, clerk; Sam Davis, orchestra musician; John J. Furey,\r\n      blacksmith and saloonkeeper.\r\n\r\n      At the time the graft prosecution opened, Wilson had resigned\r\n      his position as Supervisor to take up his work as State\r\n      Railroad Commissioner, an office to which he was elected in\r\n      1906; and Duffey to be president of the Municipal Commission of\r\n      Public Works, to which office he was appointed by Mayor\r\n      Schmitz.\r\n\r\n [17] Supervisor E. I. Walsh in a sworn statement made to Heney,\r\n      March 8, 1907, testified:\r\n\r\n      \"Q. And what was agreed upon there (in caucus) as to programme?\r\n      A. I couldn't say what was agreed upon with them.\r\n\r\n      \"Q. Wasn't it arranged that every man should be treated alike\r\n      as to money? A. It wasn't openly suggested that way; it might\r\n      have been said among the members that way.\r\n\r\n      \"Q. That was the understanding you had. A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n      \"Q. That you would be all treated equally and fairly? A. I\r\n      presume that was the way it was understood.\"\r\n\r\n      Supervisor Lonergan had been promised by Supervisor Wilson\r\n      $8000 for voting to give the United Railroads a permit to\r\n      operate its lines under the trolley system. At a second meeting\r\n      Wilson stated the amount would be $1000 only. Of the scene on\r\n      this occasion, Lonergan testified at the trial in the case of\r\n      the People vs. Ford. No. 817:\r\n\r\n      \"Q. What did he (Wilson) say on that occasion? A. There was\r\n      only $4000 in it for me.\r\n\r\n      \"Q. What did you say. A. I asked him what the hell kind of work\r\n      that was and what did he mean by it. And he shook his head and\r\n      said that if I didn't like it, all right; something to that\r\n      effect.\"\r\n\r\n [18] Evidence of Ruef's distrust of his Supervisors was brought out\r\n      at many points in the graft trials. When he discovered that\r\n      individual Supervisors were, without his knowledge, taking\r\n      bribes from the Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company,\r\n      he stated to Dr. Joseph S. Poheim:\r\n\r\n      \"I see they have been trying to take my Supervisors away from\r\n      me, but I have fixed them; I would like to see one of them\r\n      throw me down.\" (See Transcript, People vs. Ruef, 1437, Part 3,\r\n      Vol. 9, p. 4018.) In the midst of the troubles brought upon him\r\n      by the graft prosecution, Ruef complained that \"These fellows\r\n      (the Supervisors) would eat the paint off a house, and in order\r\n      to hold them together I had to descend to their level and take\r\n      them in with me.\"\r\n\r\n      Ruef was also jealous of Schmitz's activity. When he learned\r\n      that Schmitz had promised franchises independent of him, he\r\n      directed Supervisor Wilson to oppose them. \"Butt in on this\r\n      Parkside business,\" he said to Wilson. \"Mr. Schmitz has\r\n      promised the Ocean Shore and the Parkside; he is destroying my\r\n      political influence; these people ought to be made to come and\r\n      see me.\"\r\n\r\n [19] Gallagher was by far the ablest member of the Ruef-Schmitz\r\n      Board of Supervisors. He was by profession an attorney at law.\r\n      In that capacity he had served first as Assistant City\r\n      Attorney, and finally as City Attorney. For a time he was law\r\n      partner with Hon. James G. Maguire, whose opposition, as member\r\n      of Congress from California, to the Pacific railroads refunding\r\n      measures, won him a national reputation. Maguire was candidate\r\n      for Governor on the Democratic ticket in 1898, but was\r\n      defeated. Gallagher had served as Supervisor previous to his\r\n      election in 1905, and was one of the most experienced members\r\n      of the Schmitz-Ruef board.\r\n\r\n      At Ruef's trial on the charge of offering a bribe to Supervisor\r\n      Furey, Gallagher testified that soon after his election in\r\n      1905, Ruef told him there would be a number of matters coming\r\n      before the Board of Supervisors in which the corporations and\r\n      other large concerns would be interested; that there would be a\r\n      number of large deals coming before the board in which he\r\n      wanted him (Gallagher) to represent him on the board. Gallagher\r\n      accepted the agency.\r\n\r\n [20] Gallagher testified before the Oliver Grand Jury of the nature\r\n      of these caucuses. From his testimony the following is taken:\r\n\r\n      \"Q. They (the Supervisors) voted in the caucus and you knew how\r\n      the vote would be. A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n      \"Q. And they would be bound by the caucus vote. A. That was\r\n      understood that a man would vote at the caucus in the way he\r\n      would vote at the meeting.\r\n\r\n      \"Q. You were understood to represent Mr. Ruef and Mr. Ruef's\r\n      views. A. That was generally understood by members of the\r\n      board.\r\n\r\n      \"Q. And whatever way you went meant programme. A. I believe Mr.\r\n      Ruef told a number of them so, and that circulated among the\r\n      others; it was generally understood by them.\"\r\n\r\n [21] Keane's lasting loyalty to Ruef makes him one of the most\r\n      interesting characters of the graft cases. He entered Ruef's\r\n      employ in 1898 as a law clerk. He remained in Ruef's office\r\n      until January, 1902, when Mayor Schmitz took office. Keane was\r\n      then made secretary to the Mayor. He served in that capacity\r\n      until January, 1906, when Ruef gained control of the Board of\r\n      Supervisors. Ruef then made him clerk of the board. At Ruef's\r\n      trial for offering a bribe to Supervisor Furey, Gallagher\r\n      testified that Ruef told him that Keane should be clerk.\r\n      Gallagher notified the other members of Ruef's decision, and\r\n      that closed the incident. Keane was, however, much more than a\r\n      mere clerk. Supervisor Wilson testified at the Ruef trial for\r\n      offering a bribe to Furey, that he (Wilson) owed his nomination\r\n      to Keane. Keane was elected to the State Senate where his\r\n      loyalty to Ruef in foul as well as fair weather made him a\r\n      conspicuous and somewhat notorious character. At present\r\n      writing, Keane is foremost in the movement to bring about\r\n      Ruef's release from State prison.\r\n\r\n [22] At Ruef's trial on the charge of offering a bribe to Supervisor\r\n      Furey, Keane testified that these notes had been destroyed in\r\n      the great fire of April 18-19-20, 1906. Keane testified further\r\n      that Ruef was a constant attendant at the caucuses; that\r\n      Schmitz was an occasional visitor; that Supervisor Gallagher\r\n      presided.\r\n\r\n [23] Notices of the caucus meetings were sent to Ruef precisely as\r\n      though he had been a member of the Board of Supervisors. At\r\n      Ruef's trial for offering a bribe to Supervisor Furey, the\r\n      following letter of notification was introduced as evidence:\r\n\r\n                                        \"San Francisco, June 21st, 1906.\r\n\r\n      \"Hon. A. Ruef, San Francisco--Dear Sir: I respectfully beg\r\n      leave to notify you that the Board of Supervisors will meet in\r\n      caucus on Sunday evening, June 24th, at 8 o'clock p. m., at\r\n      Hamilton Hall, Steiner street, near Geary. Your attendance is\r\n      respectfully requested.\r\n\r\n      \"Yours truly,                          GEORGE B. KEANE, Clerk.\"\r\n\r\n [24] The San Francisco Chronicle in its issue of March 8, 1906, said\r\n      of the District Attorney's raids on the gamblers:\r\n\r\n      \"The political push and the underworld generally are astonished\r\n      at District Attorney Langdon's unexpected outbreak. He has\r\n      descended upon them like a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. For\r\n      the moment even wrath is less in evidence than surprise. It was\r\n      not expected. It is not what was paid for. It is like being\r\n      murdered by one's dearest friend. There is a complete reversal\r\n      of the usual experience of mankind. In most cities the lid is\r\n      on and weighed down before election but lifted and thrown away\r\n      as soon as the votes are counted. To be allowed to run wide\r\n      open before election and to be closed down and nailed up as\r\n      soon as the new official is fairly seated is outside of all\r\n      precedent. And all that after the most liberal contributions.\r\n      There is a feeling in criminal circles that somebody is guilty\r\n      of obtaining money under false pretenses. The District Attorney\r\n      is the one official for whose friendship the lawbreakers have\r\n      the most earnest longings, and behind their closed doors the\r\n      idle gamblers are trying to figure out what 'lay' this dreadful\r\n      Langdon is really on, and by what trade he has been induced to\r\n      ignore all the promises expressed or implied, which those\r\n      assumed to be able to speak for him dispersed so freely when\r\n      votes were in demand.\r\n\r\n      \"As for the public, it was for none of these things. Among the\r\n      decent portion of society the 'motives' of the District\r\n      Attorney do not arouse even passing curiosity. What does\r\n      interest them is the present vigor of his work, and the\r\n      probability of his keeping it up.\"\r\n\r\n [25] Ruef had consented to Langdon's nomination for District\r\n      Attorney, because he considered that Langdon's intimate\r\n      acquaintance with the teachers and pupils of the San Francisco\r\n      public schools would help the ticket. For the three years\r\n      preceding the campaign Langdon had been Superintendent of\r\n      Schools at San Francisco. Ruef told Langdon after the election\r\n      that he had no idea that any one other than Schmitz could be\r\n      elected on the Union-Labor party ticket that year. When during\r\n      the campaign Langdon began to develop strength in the contest\r\n      for District Attorney, Ruef sent him a check for $200 for\r\n      \"campaign expenses,\" saying that the money had been contributed\r\n      by Tirey L. Ford of the United Railroads. Langdon returned the\r\n      check to Ruef with the statement that he preferred to pay his\r\n      own campaign expenses. During the campaign at every meeting he\r\n      addressed, Langdon made the statement: \"The laws are on the\r\n      statute books; all may know them. I pledge myself to the\r\n      enforcement of these laws.\" To be sure, few if any paid much\r\n      attention to what Langdon meant, but that was no fault of\r\n      Langdon's. Everybody was to learn from the hour that he assumed\r\n      the duties of his office that he meant just what he said.\r\n      Rudolph Spreckels testified at the Calhoun trial that when\r\n      Langdon's raids on the gambling dens were made public he felt\r\n      that \"we had a District Attorney who was desirous of doing his\r\n      duty.\" The raids were made in February, 1906. Spreckels, Heney,\r\n      Phelan, Older and others were already considering plans for the\r\n      exposure and check of the reign of Ruef.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                      THE SAN FRANCISCO RUEF RULED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe decade ending 1910 was for California an era of extraordinary\r\nenterprise and development. A third transcontinental railroad, the\r\nWestern Pacific, was completed; vast land-holdings as large as 40,000\r\nacres in a body were cut up into small tracts and sold to settlers;\r\nwaters brought to the land by vast irrigation enterprises increased the\r\nland's productiveness three and even ten fold; petroleum fields,\r\nenormously rich, were opened up and developed; the utilization of the\r\nfalling waters of mountain streams to generate electric power, brought\r\ncheap light and power and heat to farm as well as to city factory. The\r\nSpanish war had brought thousands of troops to the coast. Practically\r\nall of them passed through San Francisco. This particular activity had\r\nits influence on local conditions. The State's population increased from\r\n1,485,053 in 1900 to 2,377,549 in 1910.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of the San Francisco fire, April 18, 1906, San Francisco,\r\nof the cities of the State, profited most by this development. San\r\nFrancisco bank clearances, for example, increased from $1,029,582,594.78\r\nfor the year ending December 31, 1900, to $1,834,549,788.51 for the year\r\nending December 31, 1905, a gain of 80 per cent.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco's increase in population during those five years, can, of\r\ncourse, only be estimated. On the basis of the registration for the\r\n1905 municipal election, approximately 98,000, San Francisco had, at the\r\ntime of the 1906 disaster, a population of about 500,000, an increase\r\nfrom the population of 342,782 shown by the 1900 census of practically\r\n50 per cent. in five years.[26]\r\n\r\nThe rapid increase in population, the sustained prosperity of the\r\ncommunity, and its prospective development made San Francisco one of the\r\nmost promising fields for investment in the country.\r\n\r\nThe public service corporations were quick to take advantage of the San\r\nFrancisco opportunity. Those corporations already established sought to\r\nstrengthen their position; new corporations strove for foothold in the\r\npromising field. Thus, we find the Home Telephone Company, financed by\r\nOhio and Southern California capitalists, seeking a franchise to operate\r\na telephone system in opposition to the Pacific States Telephone and\r\nTelegraph Company, which was already established. And we find the\r\nPacific States Company taking active part in municipal politics to\r\nprevent the Home franchise or any other opposition telephone franchise\r\nbeing granted. The corporation holding the light and power monopoly,\r\nthe Pacific Gas and Electric Company, had by the time of the third\r\nSchmitz inaugural, practical control of the San Francisco field. But\r\nit was face to face with a clamor for reduction of gas rates. The\r\ncompany was charging one dollar a thousand for gas. The Union-Labor\r\nparty platform of 1905 pledged the Board of Supervisors to a\r\nseventy-five-cents-per-thousand rate.\r\n\r\nAnother matter of tremendous importance to the growing municipality was\r\nthat of the supply of water. The Spring Valley Water Company had a\r\nmonopoly of this necessity, but demand for municipal water to be brought\r\nfrom the Sierras was strong. A committee of experts had been appointed\r\nto pass upon the various sources of supply. Ruef appeared before them as\r\nspokesman for the Supervisors. The experts resigned when it was made\r\nclear to them that instead of being permitted to make an adequate study\r\nof all available sources of supply they were to report upon the Bay\r\nCities project alone.[27] After the ousting of the Schmitz-Ruef\r\nadministration the Bay Cities project was ignored and bonds authorized\r\nto bring water from Hetch-Hetchy valley. The Spring Valley Water\r\nCompany, however, has been successful in blocking this project, and in\r\n1914, San Francisco seems almost as far away from realizing her ambition\r\nfor a supply of pure water as in 1905-6 when Ruef and his followers were\r\nat the height of their power.\r\n\r\nThe public-service problem which was attracting the most attention at\r\nthe time of the great fire, was that of street-car transportation. The\r\nprincipal lines had passed into the hands of the United Railroads.[28]\r\nThe corporation had, at the time of Schmitz's election in 1905,\r\npractically a monopoly of the San Francisco street-car service.\r\n\r\nThe company's principal lines were operated by the cable system. But\r\nfully five years before the fire, all traction officials as well as the\r\ngeneral public, recognized that San Francisco had outgrown the cable\r\nroad. It was admitted that electric lines must be substituted for the\r\ncable, but there was sharp division as to the character of the electric\r\nlines which should be installed. The officials of the United Railroads\r\nproposed the overhead trolley method of propulsion; the public, so far\r\nas it could find expression, declared for the underground conduit\r\nsystem.[29] In taking this position, the public was in reality backing\r\nup the municipal engineers, who had been sent to Eastern States to\r\ninvestigate electric transportation systems, and who had found in favor\r\nof the conduit and against the trolley.[30]\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco Merchants' Association, however, apparently\r\ndissatisfied with the reports of the engineers employed by the\r\nmunicipality, employed Mr. William Barclay Parsons to report on the\r\nrelative merits of the trolley and the conduit systems.\r\n\r\nMr. Parsons took issue with the city's engineers, and recommended the\r\ntrolley as against the conduit.[31] The directors of the Merchants'\r\nAssociation thereupon declared for the trolley system.\r\n\r\nCriticism of this action of the directors was followed by submission of\r\nthe question to a referendum vote of the Association membership. The\r\nmembers voted in opposition to the directors, declaring against the\r\ntrolley and for the conduit.[32]\r\n\r\nBut the most determined opposition to the installation of the trolley\r\nsystem came from improvement clubs, whose purpose was to promote the\r\nbest development of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nProminent among these organizations were the Improvement and Adornment\r\nAssociation,[33] the Sutter Street Improvement Club[34] and the Pacific\r\nAvenue Improvement Club. The membership of these organizations\r\nconsisted of some of the largest owners of San Francisco properties. The\r\nleaders were comparatively young men, natives of San Francisco, whose\r\ninterests were inseparably wrapped up in the community, and who aimed\r\nto promote the best possible development of the city of their birth and\r\nfortunes.\r\n\r\nProminent in this group were Rudolph Spreckels[35] and James D.\r\nPhelan,[36] rated among the heaviest property-owners of San Francisco.\r\nThese men were ready to join with the United Railroads in any plan which\r\nproposed the highest development of the street-car service.[37] On the\r\nother hand, they were prepared to oppose any attempt to exploit the\r\nservice to the detriment of San Francisco.[38]\r\n\r\nA conference of the directors of the Improvement and Adornment\r\nAssociation with officials of the United Railroads was finally\r\narranged.[39] The meetings were held in March, 1906, less than a month\r\nbefore the great fire. There were, before the attempted adjustment was\r\nabandoned, several sessions.\r\n\r\nThe citizens urged Patrick Calhoun, president of the United Railroads,\r\nto give up his trolley design for Market and Sutter streets. As a\r\ncompromise, he substantially agreed to build the underground conduit as\r\nfar as Powell on Sutter, and as far as Valencia on Market, picking up\r\nthe trolley on Valencia, McAllister, Hayes and Haight streets. The\r\nAdornment Committee directors wanted the conduit system on Sutter street\r\nextended as far as possible, and held out for Van Ness avenue. Calhoun\r\nwould not consent to install the conduit beyond Powell.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this deadlock, the San Francisco Chronicle published\r\nwhat purported to be reports of the several conferences. Up to that time\r\nthere had been no publication of the meetings.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Chronicle publication, Calhoun, in a letter to members of\r\nthe Adornment Association, declared the information contained in the\r\nChronicle article to be inaccurate,[40] and offered to let the people\r\ndecide whether they wanted a conduit system on Market street to\r\nValencia, and on Sutter street to Powell, or a uniform all-trolley\r\nsystem throughout the city.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun's suggestion seemed reasonable until he stated in an\r\ninterview that by the people he meant the Board of Supervisors.\r\n\r\nHe was asked how he proposed to ascertain the wishes of the people.\r\n\r\n\"I should suggest,\" he is reported as replying, \"that the matter be\r\nreferred to the decision of the Board of Supervisors. The Board of\r\nSupervisors is a public body selected by the people, and represents the\r\nideas and wishes of the people of the city.\"\r\n\r\nThe reply was not well received. The Supervisors were even then under\r\nsuspicion of corruption. Less than a fortnight before, March 10, the\r\nExaminer had called the board's action on an ordinance which was\r\nsupported by the Home Telephone Company \"suspicious,\" and had stated\r\nthat the board had \"made the mistake of acting as a bribed Board of\r\nSupervisors would have acted.\"[41]\r\n\r\nLater on, the Supervisors themselves confessed to having been bribed to\r\ngrant the telephone franchise. The public, not at all blind to what was\r\ngoing on, believed, even at the time Mr. Calhoun made his suggestion,\r\nalthough there was no proof, that the Supervisors had been bribed.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco was opposed to any plan that would put trolley cars on the\r\ncity's best streets. Submission of the issue to the people would have\r\nbeen popular. Mr. Calhoun's proposal that it be left to the Supervisors\r\nwas met with suspicion, and open distrust of Mr. Calhoun's motives.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the criticism which Mr. Calhoun's suggestion had aroused,\r\nMr. Calhoun, in a second letter to the Adornment Association, withdrew\r\nhis offer to submit the question to the people, and announced the\r\nintention of his company to proceed with preparation of a plan for a\r\nuniform trolley system to be installed wherever the grades would\r\npermit.[42]\r\n\r\nThis second letter was made public in March, 1906, less than a month\r\nbefore the fire. The position taken by the United Railroads was\r\ngenerally condemned.[43] But the opposition took more practical form\r\nthan mere denunciation. A group of capitalists, headed by Claus\r\nSpreckels, father of Rudolph Spreckels, Rudolph Spreckels and James D.\r\nPhelan, announced their intention to organize a street-railroad company,\r\nto demonstrate the practicability of operating electric cars in San\r\nFrancisco, under the conduit system.\r\n\r\nThe plan was given immediate endorsement both by press and general\r\npublic. The project was explained in detail to Mayor Schmitz, who in a\r\npublished statement gave the enterprise his unqualified approval.[44]\r\nBut when the incorporators sought further interview with Mayor Schmitz,\r\nthey found themselves unable to secure a hearing.\r\n\r\nThe company, under the name of the Municipal Street Railways of San\r\nFrancisco, was formed with Claus Spreckels, James D. Phelan, George\r\nWhittell, Rudolph Spreckels and Charles S. Wheeler as incorporators. The\r\ncapital stock of the company was fixed at $14,000,000. Of this,\r\n$4,500,000 was subscribed, ten per cent. of which, $450,000, was paid\r\nover to the treasurer.[45]\r\n\r\nWith this $450,000 an experimental line, under the conduit system, was\r\nto be built on Bush street.[46]\r\n\r\nThe articles of incorporation provided that the franchises acquired\r\nunder them should contain provisions for the acquisition by the City and\r\nCounty of San Francisco of the roads thus built.[47]\r\n\r\nThe new company filed its articles of incorporation with the Secretary\r\nof State at Sacramento on April 17, 1906.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning of the day following, April 18, came the San\r\nFrancisco earthquake and fire. For the moment the public forgot all\r\ndifferences in the common disaster. But the lines of division between\r\nexploiter and builder could not be wiped out, not even by the\r\ndestruction of the city. The contest, which had, without any one\r\nrealizing its full significance, been fast coming to a head before the\r\nfire, was to take definite shape after the disaster.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [26] Patrick Calhoun, in a letter to the press, dated March 21,\r\n      1906--less than a month before the great fire--stated that the\r\n      time was near when the San Francisco street-car system would\r\n      have to serve a million people. The 1910 census, taken four\r\n      years after the fire, gave San Francisco a population of\r\n      416,912.\r\n\r\n [27] Ruef testified before the Grand Jury that the water deal would\r\n      have been the most important pulled off by the Board of\r\n      Supervisors. He testified that he had told Gallagher to tell\r\n      the members of the Board there would be more money in it than\r\n      had been received in any other deal. Ruef gave Gallagher to\r\n      understand that the amount to be divided would be as much as\r\n      $1,000,000.\r\n\r\n [28] The United Railroads was controlled by Eastern capital. Before\r\n      the entrance of the United Railroads into the San Francisco\r\n      field, California capital had dominated in purely local public\r\n      utilities.\r\n\r\n [29] The public's opposition to the overhead trolley system was that\r\n      the poles and wires would be a disfigurement of what were\r\n      regarded as the best streets; that the wires were dangerous,\r\n      and would interfere with the work of firemen in fighting fires;\r\n      that San Francisco was as much entitled as Washington and New\r\n      York to the best system. Rudolph Spreckels at the trial of\r\n      Patrick Calhoun for offering a bribe, testified as to his own\r\n      opposition:\r\n\r\n      \"I believed that the overhead trolley was unsightly; that it\r\n      increased the risk of fire; that it was dangerous; that it was\r\n      noisy and unsightly. I believed from my own observation of the\r\n      operation of the underground conduit system in other cities\r\n      that it was preferable, that it was more sightly, just as\r\n      rapid, and in every way more in keeping with a city of the size\r\n      and importance of San Francisco. Having been born here, and\r\n      having large property interests I felt it my duty, as I always\r\n      have, and hope I always shall, to protect the interests of this\r\n      community and to protect the interests of its citizens and its\r\n      property owners. That was my purpose in opposing that franchise\r\n      and that grant.\"\r\n\r\n [30] As early as 1901, C. E. Grunsky, at that time City Engineer,\r\n      was directed by the Board of Supervisors to gather data on the\r\n      operation of electric roads under the conduit system. Grunsky's\r\n      findings were to the effect that conduit-electric roads were\r\n      rapidly replacing other types of street railroads.\r\n\r\n      The city also employed J. C. H. Stutt as consulting engineer,\r\n      and sent him to New York and Washington to inspect and report\r\n      upon the conduit systems in operation in those cities.\r\n\r\n      He reported that the system was giving satisfaction in both\r\n      cities, and in many cases was being substituted for the\r\n      trolley. Engineer Stutt in comparing the two systems said:\r\n\r\n      \"As between the overhead system and the conduit-electric\r\n      system, it is natural for private corporations to prefer the\r\n      overhead trolley system on account of the first cost of roadbed\r\n      construction, which is more than twice as great for the conduit\r\n      system. The conduit system leaves the street open with the view\r\n      unobstructed by poles, conductors, feed, guard and supporting\r\n      wires and without the menace to the public and especially to\r\n      the firemen, always inherent in the bare overhead electric\r\n      conductor.\"\r\n\r\n      This report was widely quoted during the\r\n      overhead-trolley-conduit agitation that was a feature of a\r\n      greater part of Mayor Schmitz's administrations.\r\n\r\n [31] Mr. Parsons found for the overhead trolley on the following\r\n      general grounds:\r\n\r\n      (1) That a uniform system was necessary.\r\n\r\n      (2) That the lines must be extended to the suburbs.\r\n\r\n      (3) That operation by overhead trolley is more satisfactory than by\r\n      the conduit system.\r\n\r\n      (4) That the greater part of the roads could be operated under\r\n      trolley only.\r\n\r\n [32] Several questions were presented. The following is the vote as\r\n      given in the Merchants' Association Review, the organization's\r\n      official publication, for February, 1906:\r\n\r\n                    \"TOTAL VOTE OF MEMBERS, 364.\r\n\r\n      \"1--Do you favor Mr. Parsons's view of a uniform system of\r\n          overhead trolley lines throughout the entire city,\r\n          including a central line of ornamental trolley poles, with\r\n          lights furnished by the Railroad company between the tracks\r\n          on Market Street, and a trolley line with ornamental poles\r\n          and lights furnished by the Railroad upon Sutter Street?\r\n\r\n                    \"Votes received--Yes, 121; No, 204.\r\n\r\n      \"2--Do you favor an overhead trolley system throughout the city\r\n          except on Market Street?\r\n\r\n                    \"Votes received--Yes, 67; No, 212.\r\n\r\n      \"3--Do you favor an underground conduit system for Market\r\n          Street and for the streets with cable lines leading into\r\n          Market Street in the central downtown district and in the\r\n          adjacent residence district, the remainder of the system to\r\n          be overhead trolley?\r\n\r\n                    \"Votes received--Yes, 198; No, 84.\r\n\r\n      \"4--Irrespective of what shall be done on any other streets,\r\n          which system do you favor for Sutter Street: (a) an\r\n          underground conduit, or (b) an overhead trolley line if\r\n          equipped with ornamental poles and lights furnished free by\r\n          the Railroad company, or (c) an improved cable system?\r\n\r\n                                      Underground\r\n                                        Conduit     Trolley     Cable\r\n\r\n          \"First Choice                   217          93          5\r\n          \"Second Choice                   42          83         62\r\n          \"Third Choice                     7          14         94\r\n\r\n      \"5--Do you favor changing the cable lines on Nob Hill to\r\n          electric lines by tunneling the hill and constructing a\r\n          winding driveway with parks on California Street, as\r\n          proposed in Mr. Parsons's report?\r\n\r\n                    \"Votes received--Yes, 158; No, 140.\"\r\n\r\n      This vote was taken after an extended debate at a banquet\r\n      given by the Association in which Patrick Calhoun, president\r\n      of the United Railroads, argued for the trolley system, and\r\n      Frank J. Sullivan, president of the Sutter Street Improvement\r\n      Club, spoke for the conduit.\r\n\r\n [33] The Improvement and Adornment Association employed D. H.\r\n      Burnham to draw plans for the development of San Francisco.\r\n      These plans, while drawn to attain a maximum of utility, were\r\n      intended to secure a maximum of beauty as well. Streets were\r\n      to be widened, boulevards built, parks established. The\r\n      carrying out of these plans would have made San Francisco one\r\n      of the most beautiful cities of the world. Their preparation\r\n      cost the association $17,500. Mr. Burnham volunteered his own\r\n      services.\r\n\r\n [34] The objection of the Sutter Street Improvement Club to the\r\n      overhead trolley was set forth in the following statement,\r\n      issued less than a month before the great fire of 1906:\r\n\r\n      \"The Sutter Street Improvement Club is unalterably opposed to\r\n      the construction of an overhead trolley line on the Sutter\r\n      Street system. We desire that the public should have no\r\n      misconception of our position. We propose to contest to the end\r\n      any attempt to get an overhead trolley on the entire Sutter\r\n      Street system, and for that purpose we pledge ourselves, and\r\n      promise to provide the necessary counsel to maintain our\r\n      position in the courts. We want the public with us in this\r\n      fight, as the fight is being made in the interests of the whole\r\n      people.\r\n\r\n      \"Our own investigations make us absolutely certain that if the\r\n      public understands the true situation, it will not be misled by\r\n      the specious arguments of the United Railroads. The conduit\r\n      electric system, despite what the United Railroads and its\r\n      representatives may say, is practicable, safe, efficient and\r\n      superior to an overhead trolley. We are further satisfied that\r\n      the company is seeking, by an offer of $200,000 which they\r\n      offer to the people, to save itself an expense of several\r\n      million dollars, which the conduit electric system would cost,\r\n      if it should be required to reconstruct all its lines using the\r\n      conduits; but we believe--and we are certain that the citizens\r\n      of San Francisco will agree with us in this--that since the\r\n      United Railroads, through the watering of its stock, has\r\n      already made many millions of dollars out of its properties,\r\n      and is now taking, and will take many millions of profits from\r\n      our people, that it can afford to contribute to San Francisco\r\n      the cost of the most attractive and efficient system of\r\n      electric railroads. The United Railroads has put forward many\r\n      arguments which have been and are easily met:\r\n\r\n      \"First: It contended, as the public will remember, that the\r\n      conduit electric system was impracticable on account of the\r\n      accumulation of rain water in its conduits. This claim it has\r\n      been forced to abandon.\r\n\r\n      \"Second: It proclaimed loudly that the added cost of\r\n      construction of an electric conduit was such that the life of\r\n      its franchise would not justify the outlay. Now, they have\r\n      abandoned this claim, and assert that it is not the cost of\r\n      construction, but that there are other reasons.\r\n\r\n      \"Third: They have declared that a uniform system was desirable.\r\n      They now admit that a completely uniform system is\r\n      impracticable, owing to grades, making it necessary to operate\r\n      some lines by cable. Their only contention now is that the\r\n      overhead trolley system is more efficient than either the cable\r\n      or conduit electric system.\r\n\r\n      \"Mr. C. E. Grunsky is our authority for the statement that in\r\n      making the change from the conduit electric to the trolley, in\r\n      passing from city to suburbs, there are no objectionable\r\n      features, nor danger. Sir Alex. B. W. Kennedy, consulting\r\n      engineer to the London County Council, in recommending the\r\n      adoption of the conduit electric system for London's municipal\r\n      street railways, said: 'There is no difficulty in arranging the\r\n      cars so that they can be run from the underground (conduit) to\r\n      the overhead and vice versa, either with no stoppage at all at\r\n      the point of change, or with a stopping of only a few seconds.\r\n      There is no engineering difficulty whatever in using a mixed\r\n      tramway system, i.e., partly underground (conduit) and partly\r\n      overhead.'\r\n\r\n      \"We would suggest that the public compare the present overhead\r\n      trolley system, operated by the United Railroads these many\r\n      years in this city and county, with the service rendered by the\r\n      California Cable Railway. There is no overhead trolley system\r\n      in San Francisco to-day which surpasses the service given by\r\n      the California Street Company.\r\n\r\n      \"It is claimed that the public will be given a speedier and\r\n      more efficient service if the overhead trolley is permitted. We\r\n      ask the thousands of citizens who have been compelled to wait\r\n      for overhead trolley cars, and to stand up in those overhead\r\n      vehicles, whether or not the overhead trolley has thus afforded\r\n      them satisfactory service? If we may judge the future by the\r\n      experience with the overhead trolley of the past, it means\r\n      fewer cars (hence less expense to the United Railroads),\r\n      overcrowding and discomfort of passengers. The only advantage\r\n      which thus far has come from the system seems to be to the\r\n      company itself. It employs fewer men as a result of that\r\n      system, but the comfort and convenience of the public have not\r\n      been substantially bettered by it as against the cable.\r\n\r\n      \"Before asking our people to give them an overhead trolley\r\n      system throughout the whole city, the United Railroads would do\r\n      well to show on some one of their overhead trolley lines now in\r\n      operation a frequent, efficient and satisfactory service to the\r\n      public. We do not want for San Francisco an extension and\r\n      perpetuation of the unsightly, noisy, dangerous, uncomfortable\r\n      and inefficient system of overhead trolleys as operated by the\r\n      United Railroads to-day.\r\n\r\n      \"Citizens of San Francisco: Be not deceived by the selfish and\r\n      specious arguments put forward by the United Railroads. If the\r\n      public will stand together, we will win out in this fight; and,\r\n      if it should be necessary to that end, the supporters of our\r\n      organization will put before our citizens a plan for building a\r\n      complete conduit electric system of railroads for San\r\n      Francisco, to be built, in the first instance, by our people,\r\n      but with a provision giving to the city an option to purchase\r\n      the same at any time in the future at actual cost and interest,\r\n      so that municipal ownership of the said system may result just\r\n      as soon as the city is ready for it.\r\n\r\n      \"All that we ask is that the people stand fast, and save their\r\n      city from what we believe would be a calamity from which it\r\n      would not recover in the next twenty-five years.\r\n\r\n      \"Respectfully.\r\n\r\n      \"Frank J.

Troy,\r\n      Secretary.\"\r\n\r\n [35] Rudolph Spreckels is a native of San Francisco. At seventeen he\r\n      was employed in his father's (Claus Spreckels) sugar refinery\r\n      at Philadelphia. The Spreckels refinery was at the time in a\r\n      life-and-death struggle with the \"Sugar Trust.\" Young Spreckels\r\n      was given his first lessons in the methods employed by the\r\n      \"trust\" elements to crush competition. His Philadelphia\r\n      training in large degree prepared him for the work which later\r\n      he was to do at San Francisco. At twenty-two he became\r\n      president of the Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar Company, owners\r\n      of one of the largest sugar plantations of the Hawaiian\r\n      Islands. The venture had been a losing one. Spreckels put it on\r\n      a paying basis within a year, and sold it at large profit.\r\n      Before he was twenty-five he had become a millionaire in his\r\n      own right. He has been engaged in business at San Francisco for\r\n      many years, but only when moved by corrupt conditions to take\r\n      up the fight for honest government did he become active in\r\n      politics. He financed the graft prosecution. He has since taken\r\n      active part in California politics, but has steadfastly refused\r\n      to accept public office, preferring to do his work as a private\r\n      citizen.\r\n\r\n [36] James D. Phelan is a native of San Francisco. He is one of the\r\n      largest owners of real estate in San Francisco and in\r\n      California. From his youth he has taken keen interest in public\r\n      affairs. He was chairman of the Charter convention of 1900\r\n      which framed San Francisco's present municipal Charter. He was\r\n      Mayor of San Francisco from 1896 to 1902. After the San\r\n      Francisco fire he headed the Relief Committee and was largely\r\n      instrumental in directing the work of rehabilitation. President\r\n      Roosevelt designated him by proclamation to receive funds for\r\n      the relief work, and to use the United States Mint as\r\n      depository. In 1900 the Democratic minority in the State\r\n      Legislature gave him complimentary vote for United States\r\n      Senator. In 1914 he was elected to the United States Senate,\r\n      being the first Federal Senator from California to be elected\r\n      by direct vote of The People. Senator Phelan has for many years\r\n      been close friend and business associate of Rudolph Spreckels.\r\n      He was one of the heaviest backers of the graft prosecution.\r\n\r\n [37] Rudolph Spreckels testified at the trial of Patrick Calhoun:\r\n\r\n      \"I suggested to Mr. Calhoun one thing, that if it was a\r\n      question of the length of the franchise, of the length of life\r\n      of the present franchise, standing between the people getting\r\n      the system which I believed it was entitled to, I would\r\n      personally be glad to do whatever was in my power to have the\r\n      Charter amended so that they might enjoy a longer term of\r\n      franchise, to work out the difference in cost; but that I\r\n      believed it was all important that San Francisco should have\r\n      the very best of street-car service obtainable.\"\r\n\r\n      United Railroads officials objected to the conduit system on\r\n      the ground that the conduits would fill with water. Spreckels\r\n      suggested that property owners agree to drain the conduits\r\n      without expense to the United Railroads, thus demonstrating\r\n      their practicability, on the understanding that if the conduit\r\n      system were found to be practical it should be installed. But\r\n      in this the United Railroad officials would not acquiesce. (See\r\n      testimony taken at the Calhoun trial.) The following is taken\r\n      from Charles S. Wheeler's testimony given at the Calhoun trial:\r\n\r\n      \"Mr. Heney: Q. Did not the property owners on Sutter street and\r\n      the property owners on Pacific avenue, Mr. Rudolph Spreckels\r\n      and Mr. Phelan in particular, state that they would not oppose\r\n      the United Railroads obtaining a franchise or permit for the\r\n      underground conduit on Sutter street?\r\n\r\n      \"Mr. Stanley Moore: That is objected to, if your Honor please,\r\n      as calling for the conclusion of the witness and the mental\r\n      mind and statement and hearsay of other persons.\r\n\r\n      \"Mr. Heney. I am not asking for their mental mind. I am asking\r\n      about direct statements at these meetings of committees of the\r\n      Board of Supervisors.\r\n\r\n      \"The Court: I will overrule the objection.\r\n\r\n      \"Mr. Stanley Moore. We take an exception.\r\n\r\n      \"A. I have [heard] both of them make such statements; Mr.\r\n      Phelan in substance before the Board of Supervisors, and I have\r\n      heard Mr. Spreckels make it in the Supervisors' chambers.\" (See\r\n      Transcript of Testimony, page 3197.)\r\n\r\n [38] Patrick Calhoun, president of the United Railroads, had several\r\n      conferences with Rudolph Spreckels on the questions involved in\r\n      the street-car situation. Of these conferences Spreckels\r\n      testified at the Calhoun trial:\r\n\r\n      \"Mr. Calhoun stated that he was very anxious to obtain the\r\n      overhead trolley privilege, that he understood that I was\r\n      actively opposing it, and he wanted to know whether I was open\r\n      to conviction on the subject. I told him that my mind was\r\n      entirely free, that if he could prove to my satisfaction that\r\n      the underground conduit was not feasible that I would have no\r\n      objection. I told him that the arguments that he had presented,\r\n      namely, that the Sutter street system could not be converted\r\n      into an underground conduit system because of the accumulation\r\n      of water at some number of points--I think 16 were\r\n      mentioned--was hardly worth while urging since Mr. Holland, a\r\n      former president of the United Railroads, had, together with\r\n      Mr. Chapman, urged that reason, and I related to Mr. Calhoun\r\n      that I had questioned Mr. Chapman and Mr. Holland at length in\r\n      regard to it and had satisfied myself that their reasons then\r\n      urged were not legitimate or reasonable; that during the\r\n      conversation with Mr. Holland I had asked him to state all of\r\n      the reasons that he had for desiring the overhead and urging\r\n      against the installation of the underground conduit; that Mr.\r\n      Holland and Mr. Chapman had both assured me that the only\r\n      reason was the fact that it was an engineering impossibility;\r\n      that the accumulation of water in the conduits during the rainy\r\n      season would prevent the successful operation of the cars, that\r\n      there would be repeated interruptions and general\r\n      dissatisfaction as the result. I then proposed to Mr. Holland,\r\n      I said: 'If that is the only reason and you can convince me\r\n      that that is true I have no objection to withdrawing my\r\n      opposition, but I want to propose this: Suppose I, or the\r\n      property owners on the system involved, agree to pay the\r\n      expense of the proper drainage of those conduits, and succeed\r\n      for a period of twelve months in treating the conduit drained\r\n      at those points you indicate, and succeed during that entire\r\n      term to keep them free from water, so that you and your\r\n      engineers will be obliged to admit that there was not one hour\r\n      during the twelve months during which you could not\r\n      successfully operate an underground system, will you then agree\r\n      to install that system?' Mr. Holland and Mr. Chapman looked at\r\n      one another and finally said 'Well, no, we cannot do that.'\r\n      Then I said: 'Gentlemen, you are wasting my time and your own\r\n      because your argument is not the truth and is not the only\r\n      reason you are urging, or that is prompting you to object to\r\n      putting in that system.'\r\n\r\n      \"Mr. Holland then proceeded and asked me how I proposed to\r\n      insure that result and I told him I was not an engineer, but\r\n      that common sense told me and indicated to me that it might be\r\n      possible to carry off the water at those points through an\r\n      ordinary stone sewer-pipe and distribute the accumulated waters\r\n      to the various streets running parallel to Sutter street, and\r\n      in that way carrying it off and keeping the conduits free from\r\n      water. Mr. Calhoun said: 'Well, there are other reasons--the\r\n      question of a uniform system.' He urged very strongly that it\r\n      would be a very desirable thing to avoid transferring, or it\r\n      would be an exceedingly nice thing if a man could go to his\r\n      home without transferring, and have a uniform system of cars\r\n      operating over all of the system. I told Mr. Calhoun it was\r\n      hardly a possible thing, that no man would want to stand at any\r\n      street corner and wait for fifteen or twenty cars to go by\r\n      until some one car of a particular brand would come along which\r\n      would take him to the particular part of the city he cared to\r\n      go to. Then Mr. Calhoun wanted to know if the matter couldn't\r\n      be compromised, whether I would be satisfied, if the United\r\n      Railroads would agree to construct an underground conduit\r\n      system on Sutter street from Market to Powell. He wanted to\r\n      know also about constructing an underground conduit on Market\r\n      street, and I told him no, that this did not enter into my\r\n      calculations, that I was looking to the welfare of the city of\r\n      San Francisco, that it did not involve merely getting what I\r\n      wanted in front of the particular properties in which I was\r\n      personally interested, and I told him that the reasons that had\r\n      been urged against the granting of an overhead trolley--that it\r\n      was unsightly, dangerous and noisy and not the most modern\r\n      system, was my objection, and that it held good for the entire\r\n      city and not alone on the streets in which I was interested as\r\n      a property owner. Mr. Calhoun urged further the desirability of\r\n      the overhead trolley, that it had given satisfaction elsewhere,\r\n      and I suggested that he might first make the street cars then\r\n      operated by the overhead trolley in San Francisco a success and\r\n      satisfactory to the people; that I felt that it was far from a\r\n      success, and personally, as one of the largest property-owners\r\n      on Ellis street, I would emphatically prefer the ordinary cable\r\n      system to the electric lines that they were then operating. Mr.\r\n      Calhoun asked for another appointment and it was had I think on\r\n      the following morning, a meeting at the same place, at the\r\n      Canadian Bank of Commerce; I think our meeting on that occasion\r\n      was held in the office of the manager, Mr. Kains.\r\n\r\n      \"Q. What was said there? A. I will not be absolutely certain as\r\n      to whether all that I have related occurred at the first\r\n      interview, or whether some that I will relate as having\r\n      occurred now, did not occur on the first interview. The two\r\n      meetings were close together, and the subjects that I will\r\n      relate may have occurred, some of them in the previous meeting\r\n      and some in the latter. Mr. Calhoun proceeded to ask me about\r\n      Pacific avenue. He said: 'Would you be satisfied if we agreed\r\n      to operate the underground conduit system on Sutter to Powell,\r\n      on Market to Valencia, running it, if we changed the system on\r\n      the Pacific avenue line--to agree to put in the conduit there,\r\n      otherwise maintaining the cable?' And he also proposed that it\r\n      might be a nice thing to withdraw the entire street railway\r\n      system from Pacific avenue, making of that street a boulevard,\r\n      and placing overhead trolley on Broadway where there was no car\r\n      line. He said, 'Of course, Mr. Spreckels, you are an owner of\r\n      carriages and automobiles, and I suppose you don't use the\r\n      street-cars, and it would be more desirable from the standpoint\r\n      of a property owner to have your residence under those\r\n      circumstances on a boulevard than on a street having a\r\n      street-car service with the attending objections.' I told Mr.\r\n      Calhoun that my fight was not a selfish one, that I did have\r\n      carriages and automobiles, that I did not use the street-cars\r\n      and had no need for them, but that I had in mind the rights of\r\n      other people living on the street--that there were many people\r\n      living on the street who were not so fortunate as I, who did\r\n      not own carriages and did not own automobiles and had\r\n      undoubtedly been brought to buy their property on Pacific\r\n      avenue because of the fact that it had a street-car service\r\n      there. Mr. Calhoun also in one of these interviews said that he\r\n      would tunnel Powell street hill commencing at Sutter and make\r\n      that the most important transferring point in San Francisco. I\r\n      asked Mr. Calhoun at the time whether it was because I was\r\n      interested in property at the corner of Sutter and Powell. Mr.\r\n      Calhoun expressed surprise and said he didn't know that I was\r\n      an owner of property there. I think that in substance was the\r\n      conversation as I remember it.\"\r\n\r\n [39] Patrick Calhoun, Tirey L. Ford and Thornwell Mullally were\r\n      among the officials representing the United Railroads at the\r\n      conference. At the meeting, first mention of $200,000 in\r\n      connection with the proposed chance in the street-car system\r\n      was made. Citizens had contended that the objection of the\r\n      United Railroads in opposing the conduit system was the\r\n      difference in the initial cost of installation. This point came\r\n      up, and President Calhoun stated that he would, if the trolley\r\n      system were allowed, give the difference between the cost of\r\n      installing the two systems, for any public purpose. This\r\n      difference, Calhoun stated, would be about $200,000. Turning to\r\n      James D. Phelan, of the Adornment Committee, Calhoun stated\r\n      that the money could be used in extending the so-called Park\r\n      Panhandle, part of the Burnham plans, and a matter in which\r\n      Phelan was greatly interested. Phelan replied that San\r\n      Francisco would not accept money for any such purpose, and was\r\n      able to construct the Park Panhandle if the people wanted it.\r\n      (See testimony of James D. Phelan at the trial of The People\r\n      vs. Patrick Calhoun for offering a bribe, page 2750.)\r\n\r\n [40] The Chronicle in its issue of March 23, in referring to Mr.\r\n      Calhoun's letter practically charged him with lack of good\r\n      faith. The Chronicle said:\r\n\r\n      The alleged 'inaccuracy' of the Chronicle's interesting report\r\n      of the compromise reached by the United Railroads and the\r\n      Society for the Adornment of the City proves to be that the\r\n      electric conduit in Sutter street is to stop at Powell street\r\n      instead of extending to Polk street, as proposed, and which is\r\n      the least which should have been accepted if any compromise\r\n      whatever was to be made. We shall be greatly surprised if when\r\n      the changes are finally made there is not a great deal less\r\n      conduit than Mr. Calhoun now seems to agree to. We gravely\r\n      doubt whether Mr. Calhoun expects to construct a foot of\r\n      conduit in this city. However, he does agree to do so under\r\n      certain conditions and we shall see what we shall see.... It\r\n      does look as though some settlement of the matter would be\r\n      reached, as the United Railroads have receded from their\r\n      iron-clad determination not to consider the electric conduit at\r\n      all. When that is accomplished we shall speedily see the last\r\n      of the cables south of California street, a consummation as\r\n      devoutly wished by the people as was the introduction of the\r\n      cable in place of the horse-car a quarter of a century ago.\"\r\n\r\n [41] It was openly charged that money had been used to put this\r\n      franchise through the preliminary steps necessary for its\r\n      granting. The Examiner in its issue of March 10, some five\r\n      weeks before the fire, said:\r\n\r\n      \"The Supervisors owe it to themselves to bring back the\r\n      telephone franchise order for further consideration. Since the\r\n      hasty vote on the ordinance last Monday ugly rumors have been\r\n      the measure. The regard of the Supervisors for the good name of\r\n      the Board demands that they should clear the record of the\r\n      SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES that surround the vote on the order.\r\n\r\n      \"The present Board of Supervisors was elected on a platform\r\n      that pledged its members to a municipal ownership programme.\r\n      Among the purposes specifically announced was the ACQUISITION\r\n      OF A TELEPHONE PLANT to be owned and operated by the city.\r\n\r\n      \"Yet the FIRST ACT OF THE BOARD in dealing with a public\r\n      utility question is to favor an ordinance granting a franchise\r\n      for fifty years to a private corporation without proper\r\n      compensation to the city and WITHOUT ANY CONTRACT that would\r\n      enable the city to buy out the plant at a just appraisement\r\n      when the time comes to acquire a municipal telephone system.\r\n\r\n      \"The bill was introduced after a brief hearing and passed to\r\n      print on the 26th of February. On the 5th of March it was\r\n      passed to a vote in the Board of Supervisors without\r\n      discussion. One of the members of the Board who rose to explain\r\n      his vote was shut off with such indignity that he left the\r\n      Supervisors' chamber. Nor, indeed, did all the members know\r\n      what they were voting on; for one of the Supervisors later in\r\n      the session asked if the telephone franchise was not to be\r\n      called up, and was surprised to be told that it had already\r\n      been passed upon.\r\n\r\n      \"This sort of 'gum-shoe' legislation will not do for San\r\n      Francisco. It inevitably rouses the suspicions of crookedness\r\n      that have been hawked about the streets since Monday last.\r\n\r\n      \"A telephone franchise is not a matter to be treated lightly.\r\n      It is an affair of more moment than passing a street or even of\r\n      fixing a water rate. It deserves the deepest consideration, for\r\n      the division of service between two companies creates a\r\n      confusion in business that should be taken carefully into\r\n      account. It is only the wretched service given by the old\r\n      company that has brought the backing of a certain popular\r\n      support to the advent of a new company. The manner in which the\r\n      obvious evils of a division of service can be lessened requires\r\n      much more thought than has yet been given, and many changes in\r\n      the ordinance should be made unless the last state of the San\r\n      Francisco telephone service is to be worse than the first.\r\n\r\n      \"It is the duty of the Supervisors to recall the ordinance,\r\n      answer the rumors of crooked work by seeing that everything is\r\n      carried on above board and in the open, and treat the franchise\r\n      in accordance with their anti-election pledges to the people.\r\n      They cannot afford to rest under appearance of evil that now\r\n      surrounds the late vote on the order.\r\n\r\n      \"We do not wish to believe that any undue influence was used,\r\n      but the Supervisors must have heard the rumors that are\r\n      frequent in the streets, and they must realize that they have\r\n      made the mistake of acting as a bribed Board of Supervisors\r\n      would have acted. They have broken their pledge, but happily it\r\n      is not too late for them to correct the gross error.\"\r\n\r\n [42] Mr. Calhoun's second letter, as introduced as evidence at his\r\n      trial for offering a bribe (page 2775, Transcript, The People\r\n      vs. Calhoun), was as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"San Francisco, March 23.--Messrs. James D. Phelan, R. B. Hale,\r\n      Herbert E. Law, Rufus P. Jennings and others--My dear Sirs: You\r\n      will recall that the only condition on which I consented to\r\n      even consider the introduction of an underground conduit on\r\n      Market street from the ferries to Valencia, and on Sutter from\r\n      Market to Powell, was to secure harmony and unanimity of action\r\n      in the development of San Francisco. You will further recall\r\n      that I distinctly stated that 'if all sides to this controversy\r\n      are not willing to faithfully and loyally abide by what the\r\n      people of San Francisco may determine on this subject, the\r\n      United Railroads prefers to urge, in the interest of the\r\n      development of San Francisco, a uniform system of overhead\r\n      trolley operation.'\r\n\r\n      \"The development of the last few days, the threatened\r\n      litigation against my company, and the action of the\r\n      Sutter-Street Improvement Club, demonstrate that harmony and\r\n      unanimity of action, so much to be desired, cannot be obtained,\r\n      and that the United Railroads cannot expect all parties to the\r\n      controversy 'to faithfully and loyally abide by what the people\r\n      of San Francisco may determine on this subject.' On the\r\n      contrary, if the people should elect to put an overhead on\r\n      Sutter street, the address of the Sutter-Street Improvement\r\n      Club distinctly states 'we pledge ourselves and promise to\r\n      provide the necessary counsel to maintain our position in the\r\n      courts.'\r\n\r\n      \"In view of these facts, I desire to inform you that the United\r\n      Railroads will proceed to prepare a plan for the improvement of\r\n      the transportation of San Francisco. The essential feature of\r\n      which plan will be a modern, up-to-date, efficient and uniform\r\n      system of electric propulsion, through the introduction of the\r\n      overhead trolley system wherever the grades of the streets of\r\n      the city will permit. When this plan is perfected it will be\r\n      presented to the proper authorities of the city for their\r\n      consideration. We will be very glad to go over it with you.\r\n      Under the circumstances, it will be useless for me now to\r\n      furnish the preliminary plan of which we spoke.\r\n\r\n      \"In conclusion, permit me to express my appreciation of the\r\n      motives which led you to seek a conference with me, and the\r\n      earnest desire of every gentleman who participated in that\r\n      conference to reach a basis of harmonious action in order that\r\n      the development of San Francisco might not be obstructed and\r\n      delayed.\r\n\r\n      \"Very truly yours,                  PATRICK CALHOUN, President.\"\r\n\r\n [43] The Chronicle commented upon Mr. Calhoun's new position as\r\n      follows:\r\n\r\n      \"The letter written by Patrick Calhoun of the United Railroads\r\n      to the committee of citizens who have sought to induce him to\r\n      change his attitude on the subject of overhead trolleys was not\r\n      in good taste. It exhibited corporative arrogance in its most\r\n      exasperating form. Mr. Calhoun is too well bred, or perhaps too\r\n      cautious a man to tell the public to be damned, but every line\r\n      of his communication breathes the spirit of the insolent\r\n      utterance of William K. Vanderbilt, and the community will take\r\n      it that way....\r\n\r\n      \"There is an ill-concealed menace in Mr. Calhoun's declaration\r\n      that the United Railroads has a plan in preparation which, when\r\n      perfected, 'will be presented to the proper authorities of the\r\n      city for their consideration.' As he plainly tells us that this\r\n      plan provides for an 'efficient and uniform system of electric\r\n      propulsion through the introduction of the overhead trolley\r\n      system wherever the grades of the city will permit,' the\r\n      announcement is equivalent to a notification that 'the proper\r\n      authorities of the city' will be appealed to for permission to\r\n      carry out such a scheme, whether the people like it or not. His\r\n      defiant attitude suggests that he feels pretty sure that the\r\n      authorities will be on the side of the United Railroads against\r\n      the people, but he may be mistaken on that score. There is a\r\n      point beyond which even complaisant authorities would not wish\r\n      to press the matter to oblige a corporation which shows so\r\n      little regard for the desires and needs of a community from\r\n      which it extracts over eight million dollars annually.\" (See\r\n      San Francisco Chronicle, March 25, 1906.)\r\n\r\n [44] Mayor Schmitz in his statement, said:\r\n\r\n      \"If Claus Spreckels can see his way clear to carry out his\r\n      great purpose, the fact stands that he must be known more than\r\n      ever as he has been known in the past, as the greatest public\r\n      benefactor of the West. I will say, if he can see his way\r\n      clear, reservedly, for I doubt that any citizen of this city\r\n      or State can point to any understanding that he has announced\r\n      he would accomplish, that he has failed to accomplish. Not\r\n      only is his determination, but within his control is the money\r\n      to carry out his determination, and I have yet failed to find\r\n      the man that can say that any object can fail of\r\n      accomplishment when determination and money walk hand in hand.\r\n\r\n      \"If Mr. Spreckels can carry out his announced desire to\r\n      network San Francisco with railroads operated by the\r\n      underground conduit system, I can only say that through his\r\n      wonderful ambitions of purpose San Francisco will take a\r\n      stride forward that is wonderful to contemplate. Such action\r\n      upon the part of Mr. Spreckels would place San Francisco not\r\n      only in advance of any city in America, but would place it in\r\n      advance of any city in the world in the battle for public\r\n      control of utilities operated for the public benefit. The\r\n      offer of Mr. Spreckels is not only one that must awaken the\r\n      amazement, but the approbation of every public-spirited\r\n      citizen. While the rest of the great cities of the world (as\r\n      well as San Francisco before Mr. Spreckels made his offer) are\r\n      puzzling to find means through which they can accomplish the\r\n      great purpose of municipal ownership, Mr. Spreckels has come\r\n      forward and has offered, for the good of the people, to\r\n      demonstrate the efficiency of a system that will mean that not\r\n      only shall the beauty of San Francisco be not sacrificed, but\r\n      that the public desire for rapid transit shall be fulfilled.\r\n      Backed with the millions he controls, his offer is\r\n      significant, and is one that we cannot contemplate lightly.\r\n\r\n      \"As Chief Executive of the city I can only express the hope\r\n      that something will happen that will permit Mr. Spreckels to\r\n      carry out his object. At one stride this would place San\r\n      Francisco at the head of the world in the titanic struggle now\r\n      waging between the people and the corporations for the control\r\n      of those utilities in which the people are interested for\r\n      comfort and the corporations for profit. Great as is his\r\n      offer, it adds not only enthusiasm, but rekindles hope in my\r\n      always expressed desire that my administration would mark the\r\n      first victory of the municipality in its fight to control\r\n      those things that are theirs.\r\n\r\n      \"The people are on the eve of winning for themselves those\r\n      things that are theirs. If the offer of Mr. Spreckels can be\r\n      carried out, and I see no reason why it cannot, the battle is\r\n      ended. Not only will San Francisco be the victor, but from the\r\n      battle she will emerge, her beauty unmarred and her railways\r\n      standing as exemplifications of the fact that what in science\r\n      is possible is capable of actual and practical\r\n      accomplishment.\" (See San Francisco Call, March 24, 1906.)\r\n\r\n      But in spite of this approval, after the organization of the\r\n      new company was assured, Rudolph Spreckels found the Mayor's\r\n      door closed to him when he attempted to secure an interview.\r\n      (See Rudolph Spreckels' testimony at the Calhoun trial.)\r\n\r\n [45] The purposes of the incorporators were brought out at the\r\n      graft trials. At the Calhoun trial, when James D. Phelan,\r\n      former Mayor of San Francisco, and one of the incorporators,\r\n      was under cross-examination, Calhoun's attorney referred to\r\n      other public utility ventures in which Claus Spreckels had\r\n      been interested, and asked:\r\n\r\n      \"Q. You knew of the matter of the rival gas or competing gas\r\n      lines, and the rival and competing electric lines, and the\r\n      rival and competing steam railroads down the valley at the\r\n      time you went into the corporation to put in the People's\r\n      Street Railroad? A. I knew, and I know the effect they had;\r\n      they reduced rates in both cases; and if our system\r\n      accomplished the purpose of bringing Mr. Calhoun's railroad to\r\n      a realization of the public desire to have a conduit system,\r\n      our purpose would have been accomplished. It was the last\r\n      resort. I looked upon it, as an incorporator, as the last\r\n      resort. We had negotiated in a friendly way for months, and I\r\n      saw the fruit of all the conferences fade away and believed\r\n      that arrangements had been made by Mr. Calhoun with the city\r\n      administration, and the only resort left to us to do was to\r\n      build a road of our own to demonstrate that it was practicable\r\n      and possibly profitable--a conduit system.\"\r\n\r\n [46] As early as April 3, 1906, a petition was circulated for\r\n      signatures among residents and property owners on Bush street,\r\n      asking the Board of Supervisors to grant a franchise to\r\n      operate street-cars on Bush street under the electric-conduit\r\n      system.\r\n\r\n [47] The San Francisco Examiner of March 31, 1906, set forth that\r\n      \"an important feature (of the plans for competing street\r\n      railways) was that the city should have the right at the end\r\n      of ten years or any shorter period that might be preferred, to\r\n      take over the system and operate the same itself, the terms of\r\n      the transfer to be such as would be just both to the builders\r\n      and to the municipality.\"\r\n\r\n      Among the purposes for which the Municipal Street Railways of\r\n      San Francisco was formed, was set forth in the articles of\r\n      incorporation the following: \"To accept and acquire franchises\r\n      for street railroads, elevated railroads and subways,\r\n      containing provisions for the acquisition thereof by the City\r\n      and County of San Francisco, or such other conditions as may\r\n      be lawfully inserted therein.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                    SAN FRANCISCO AFTER THE FIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great San Francisco fire was brought under control Friday, April 20,\r\n1906. The Sunday following, the first step was taken toward getting the\r\nscattered Board of Supervisors together. George B. Keane, clerk of the\r\nboard, is authority for the statement that the meeting place was in a\r\nroom back of Supervisor McGushin's saloon.[48] The ashes of the burned\r\ncity were still hot; the average citizen was thinking only of the next\r\nmeal and shelter for the night for himself and dependents. But the\r\npublic-service corporations were even then active in furthering plans\r\nwhich had been temporarily dropped while San Francisco was burning.\r\n\r\nAt the McGushin-saloon meeting, Keane found with the Supervisors Mr.\r\nFrick of the law firm of Thomas, Gerstle & Frick. Mr. Frick was on hand\r\nto represent the petitioners for the Home Telephone franchise, which, at\r\nthe time of the disaster was pending before the board.\r\n\r\nFor months previous to the fire, no subject affecting a San Francisco\r\npublic-service corporation had, with the single exception of the United\r\nRailroads' scheme for substituting electric for cable service, created\r\nmore discussion than the Home Telephone application for franchise.\r\nThere had been allegations that the progress which, previous to the\r\nfire, the Home Company had made toward securing its franchise, had been\r\npaid for,[49] but for weeks after the fire few citizens had time to\r\nthink about it. The people forgot for the time the issues which had\r\nbefore the disaster divided the city. But the agents for the\r\npublic-service corporations did not forget. We find a representative of\r\nthe Home Telephone Company picking his way over the hot ashes of the\r\nburned city to McGushin's saloon to meet the Supervisors that the\r\ninterests of his company might be preserved. The developments of the\r\ngraft prosecution indicate that even as the Home Company was seeking out\r\nthe Supervisors, the United Railroads was getting into touch with\r\nRuef.[50]\r\n\r\nBut if the corporations were quick to avail themselves of the situation\r\nto secure privileges denied them before the fire, they were also active\r\nin the work of rehabilitation--so far as such activity served their\r\nplans and purposes.\r\n\r\nThis was well illustrated by the course of the United Railroads. Within\r\na fortnight after the fire, that corporation had established efficient\r\nservice over a number of its electric lines. For a time, passengers were\r\ncarried without charge. On April 29 and 30, however, fares were\r\ncollected from men, but not from women and children. With the beginning\r\nof May, fares were collected from all persons. For a time, in a glare of\r\nmuch publicity, the United Railroads contributed these collections to\r\nthe fund for the relief of the stricken city.\r\n\r\nThe Home Telephone Company had no plant to restore nor authority to\r\nestablish one; but on Ruef's suggestion it, too, contributed to the fund\r\nfor the relief of the stricken city--$75,000.[51]\r\n\r\nThe United Railroads' activity in restoring its electric roads, was in\r\ncurious contrast to its failure to take advantage of the possibilities\r\noffered by its cable systems. As some excuse for this inactivity, the\r\ncorporation's representatives alleged that the cable slots had been\r\nclosed by the earthquake, making restoration of the cable roads\r\nimpractical.\r\n\r\nThe alleged closing of the slots was even used as argument against the\r\nconduit electric system.[52] But as a matter of fact, there were many\r\nto testify that the damage done the cable slots was not from the\r\nearthquake, although the slots in the burned district had been warped\r\nmore or less by the heat of the fire. But this damage was easily\r\nremedied. On the Geary-street road, for example, cars were run for an\r\nhour or more after the earthquake. The fire warped the Geary-street\r\ncable slot, but this was easily and cheaply remedied by a force of men\r\nwith cold chisels and hammers.[53]\r\n\r\nStatements from officials of the United Railroads, now of record,\r\nindicate that the company's cable lines suffered no greater damage than\r\ndid other cable systems. An affidavit of Frank E. Sharon, for example,\r\nwho before the fire was superintendent of cables and stables belonging\r\nto the United Railroads, made in the adjustment of fire losses sustained\r\nby that corporation, sets forth that the company's principal cable power\r\nhouse and repair shops situate on Valencia street were damaged but\r\nlittle by the earthquake.[54] Although the buildings were damaged by\r\nthe fire, the damage to the contents, including the machinery by which\r\nthe cable cars were operated, was, according to statements made by the\r\nUnited Railroads in fire-loss adjustment, comparatively small. The\r\ncompany placed the sound value upon this machinery and contents, after\r\nthe earthquake, but preceding the fire, at $70,308.80. The salvage was\r\nplaced at $60,933.80, leaving a total fire loss of $9,375.[55]\r\n\r\nThe cable cars, with few exceptions, were saved. The most serious loss\r\nof cars was on the Powell-street system, where sixty-four were\r\ndestroyed. Only one Valencia-street car was burned. After both\r\nearthquake and fire, the United Railroads had available at least 150\r\ncable cars for its Market and Powell-street systems. This does not\r\ninclude the cable cars available on the Hayes and McAllister roads. The\r\npower-houses of these two last-named systems were not destroyed by fire.\r\nThe allegation has been made that the McAllister-street cable was kept\r\nrunning for several hours after the earthquake.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the possibilities for the restoration of the United\r\nRailroads' cable properties, no steps were taken toward that end.\r\nInstead, trolley wires were strung over the tracks of cable systems.\r\nStreet-car service was one of the greatest needs of the first few weeks\r\nfollowing the fire. Statements that cable properties could not be\r\nrestored were generally believed; the trolley service was accepted as a\r\nmatter of expediency; few thought, however, that it was to be\r\npermanent.[56]\r\n\r\nWithin two weeks after the fire, the United Railroads had trolley wires\r\nstrung over the cable tracks on Market street. The little objection made\r\nto this course went unheeded. The Market-street trolley cars, two weeks\r\nafter the fire, were as welcome to The People of San Francisco as were\r\nthe temporary shacks which were being erected upon the sites of the old\r\ncity's finest buildings. Market-street trolley cars gave as\r\nsorely-needed transportation as the shacks gave needed shelter.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Market-street trolley line was made subject for\r\nrejoicing throughout the city. In the midst of this good feeling toward\r\nhis company, President Calhoun gave out that if allowed to place\r\noverhead wires on Sutter and Larkin streets, he would place 2,000 men at\r\nwork and have both these lines in operation within thirty days.[57]\r\n\r\nBut the era of good feeling was not of long duration. On May 14, less\r\nthan a month after the fire, the Supervisors received a communication\r\nsigned by President Calhoun as President of the United Railroads,\r\nsetting forth that if the board would permit the use on the cable lines\r\nof the standard electric system in use on the company's other lines, the\r\nUnited Railroads would be glad to put all of their lines in commission\r\nas rapidly as could be accomplished by the most liberal expenditure of\r\nmoney and the largest possible employment of men.[58]\r\n\r\nThat very day, the Supervisors took the initial step toward granting to\r\nthe United Railroads a blanket permit, authorizing that corporation to\r\nsubstitute the trolley system for all its cable lines.\r\n\r\nImmediately, San Francisco's opposition to the trolley system was\r\nrevived. All classes joined in condemning the action of the board. The\r\nSutter Street Improvement Club, representing large down-town interests\r\nand property holders, adopted resolutions demanding that the Supervisors\r\nrefuse to grant the permit. The San Francisco Labor Council,\r\nrepresenting over 100 affiliated unions, with a membership of more than\r\n30,000 wage earners, declared as strongly against such action. The press\r\ncharged the United Railroads with taking advantage of the city's\r\ndistress to force the trolley upon her.[59]\r\n\r\nThen came explanations and defense. Mayor Schmitz in public interviews\r\nset forth that the proposed permit was not a permanent measure, nor\r\nunder its provisions could the United Railroads indefinitely operate\r\ntrolley cars in Market street.[60] The Labor Council which had at first\r\nadopted resolutions condemning the policy of granting the permit,\r\nadopted resolutions of confidence in the \"present city administration.\"\r\nPresident Calhoun himself solicited citizens to attend the meeting of\r\nthe board at which a vote was to be taken on the proposed permit, to\r\nurge action favorable to the United Railroads.[61]\r\n\r\nLong before the board met to take final action it was recognized that in\r\nspite of opposition the permit would be granted.[62] And it was\r\ngranted. On May 21, the Supervisors passed the ordinance which gave the\r\nUnited Railroads authority to convert its cable systems, wherever grades\r\nwould permit, into trolley lines. For this privilege, no money\r\ncompensation, nor promise of compensation, was made the city.[63]\r\n\r\nDemand that Mayor Schmitz veto the ordinance granting these\r\nextraordinary privileges followed. Nevertheless, the Mayor affixed his\r\nsignature to the trolley permit-granting ordinance.\r\n\r\nFair expression of the feeling this action engendered will be found in\r\nthe San Francisco papers of the latter part of May, 1906. \"Mayor Eugene\r\nE. Schmitz,\" said the Examiner, for example, \"has betrayed the trust\r\nreposed in him by the people, violated his solemn pledge in favor of an\r\nunderground conduit system, and joined Abe Ruef and the United Railroads\r\nin the shameless work of looting the city at the time of her greatest\r\nneed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ruef-Schmitz administration protested at the criticism. The\r\neighteen Supervisors, seventeen of whom were within a year to confess\r\nthat they had accepted bribes and all of whom were to be involved in the\r\nscandal, joined in a letter[64] to the Examiner, announcing that such\r\ncriticism was unwarranted, and injured the city. The letter contained\r\nveiled threat that questioning of the Supervisors' motives would not be\r\ntolerated. The threat, however, intimidated nobody. Criticism of Ruef\r\nand the administration continued.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the hostility toward him, Ruef controlled the San\r\nFrancisco delegates who were named that year to attend the Republican\r\nState convention. The convention met at Santa Cruz. Ruef held the\r\nbalance of power. He was the most sought man there. He had the\r\nnomination for Governor in his hands. He gave it to James N.\r\nGillett.[65]\r\n\r\nWhile the convention was in session, a dinner was given the State\r\nleaders of the Republican party at the home of Major Frank McLaughlin,\r\nthen Chairman of the Republican State Central Committee. Ruef was one of\r\nthe select few present. A flash-light picture of that banquet board\r\nshows him seated in the place of honor at the center of the table, the\r\nremaining guests with the exception of the host, McLaughlin, who is\r\nseated at Ruef's side, standing.\r\n\r\nAt Ruef's back stands James N. Gillett, who had just received, with\r\nRuef's assistance, the party nomination for Governor, his hand resting\r\nupon Ruef's shoulder. Others in this flash-light group are George\r\nHatton, political manipulator, whose connection with the 1905 mayoralty\r\ncampaign in San Francisco has already been noted; J. W. McKinley, head\r\nof the Southern Pacific Law Department at Los Angeles, who was chairman\r\nof the convention; Rudolph Herold, a politician prominent in the\r\ncounsels of the old \"Southern Pacific machine\"; Justice F. W. Henshaw of\r\nthe California Supreme Bench, who was nominated at the convention for\r\nre-election;[66] Walter F. Parker, political agent for the Southern\r\nPacific Company; Warren R. Porter, who had just received the nomination\r\nfor Lieutenant-Governor; Congressman J. R. Knowland, prominent in the\r\ncounsels of the \"machine\" that at the time dominated the State, and\r\nJudge F. H. Kerrigan of the Appellate Bench, whose decision in favor of\r\nthe Southern Pacific Company while on the Superior Bench, in the\r\nso-called San Joaquin Valley railroad rate case, made him a conspicuous\r\nfigure in California public life.[67]\r\n\r\nThe group represented the most effective forces at the time in\r\nCalifornia politics. Ruef, at the Santa Cruz convention, reached the\r\nheight of his power. He left Santa Cruz planning a State organization\r\nthat would make him as great a factor in State politics as he was at the\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\nBut on his return to San Francisco, Ruef found himself harassed by\r\ncriticism and beset by opposition. At every point in the municipal\r\nadministration, with the exception of the District Attorney's office,\r\nwas suggestion of graft and incompetency. The police department could\r\nnot, or would not, control the criminal element. Merchants, in the\r\nmiddle of the day, were struck down at their places of business and\r\nrobbed. Several were fatally injured in such attacks, being found dying\r\nand even dead behind their counters. Street robberies were of daily\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nIn the acres of ash-strewn ruins, was junk worth hundreds of thousands\r\nof dollars. The police seemed utterly powerless to protect this\r\nproperty. It became the loot of unchecked bands of thieves.\r\n\r\nA reign of terror prevailed. Citizens feared to appear on the streets at\r\nnight. Merchants charged that their business was seriously injured by\r\nthese conditions. On all sides, blame was placed upon the Schmitz\r\nadministration which Ruef was known to control.[68]\r\n\r\nThen again, Ruef's toll from the tolerated gambling, saloon and social\r\nevil interests was getting too heavy for his own safety.[69] The public\r\nwas given hint of this when the newspapers quoted George Renner, a\r\nprominent businessman, as asserting that a liquor license could be\r\nsecured if the applicant \"put the matter into Ruef's hands and paid a\r\nfat little fee.\" Ruef, in his reply, stated that the liquor people were\r\nnuisances anyhow. Ruef had long acted as attorney for the California\r\nLiquor Dealers' Association. The Association, after Ruef's flippant\r\ncharacterization of the liquor people, boldly dispensed with his\r\nservices and employed another attorney, Herbert Choynski, in his stead.\r\nChoynski made no effort to placate Ruef. On the contrary, he gave out\r\ninterviews to the press charging that Ruef had received $500,000 for the\r\ntrolley permit, and that each Supervisor had been given $4000 or $5000\r\nfor his vote.\r\n\r\nThis story was given some credit, although few realized the amount of\r\ntruth it contained.\r\n\r\nThe Supervisors were spending money freely. Men, who in private life had\r\nearned less than $100 a month, and as Supervisors were receiving only\r\nthat amount, gave evidence of being generously supplied with funds.\r\nSupervisor Coffey, a hack driver, took a trip to Chicago. Lonergan,\r\ndriver of a delivery wagon, announced plans for a tour of Ireland with\r\nhis wife and children. Wilson planned a trip through the Eastern States.\r\nThe official head of the administration, Mayor Schmitz, left on a trip\r\nto Europe, leaving Supervisor Gallagher as acting Mayor.[70] Reports\r\nprinted in San Francisco papers of Schmitz, the orchestra player, as\r\nguest of the most expensive European hotels, did not tend to lessen the\r\nopposition to the administration.\r\n\r\nThe general dissatisfaction with the administration finally found\r\nexpression in a mass meeting intended to inaugurate a movement to rid\r\nthe community of Ruef's influence.[71] The meeting was called in the\r\nname of various promotion associations and improvement clubs. It was to\r\nhave been held in the rooms of the California Promotion Association, a\r\ntemporary shack that had been erected in Union Square, a public park in\r\nthe business district. But the crowd which gathered was so great that\r\nthe meeting had to be held in the park itself.\r\n\r\nWhen the committee in charge met to complete final preparations,\r\npreliminary to calling the meeting to order, Ruef and Acting Mayor\r\nGallagher, with astonishing assurance, appeared before the committee and\r\noffered their co-operation in the work in hand. Their presence does not\r\nappear to have been welcome. Nevertheless, before the resolutions which\r\nthe committee had under consideration were read before the crowd, all\r\nharsh references to Ruef and the municipal administration had been\r\nexpurgated. In effect, the expurgated resolutions called upon commercial\r\norganizations, clubs, labor unions and similar bodies to form a\r\ncommittee of 100 for public safety.\r\n\r\nIn the meeting which followed the expurgation of the resolutions, the\r\norganizers of the movement lost control. Their counsel was for\r\nmoderation in a situation where all elements were at work.\r\n\r\nThe crowd was made up of Ruef claquers who shouted everybody down;\r\nmembers of Labor Unions who had been led to believe that the purpose of\r\nthe gathering was to break down the unions; and of radicals who were for\r\nproceeding immediately to clean up the town. Those responsible for the\r\ngathering appeared appalled at its magnitude, and showed themselves\r\nunable to cope with the situation.\r\n\r\nWilliam A. Doble presided. Samuel M. Shortridge, an attorney who was to\r\nplay a prominent part in the graft trials, stood at Doble's side and\r\nacted as a sort of director of the proceedings. The expurgated\r\nresolutions were read by the President of the Merchants' Association, E.\r\nR. Lillienthal. The ayes were called for and the resolutions declared to\r\nhave been adopted. The next moment announcement was made that the\r\nmeeting stood adjourned.\r\n\r\nAn angry demonstration followed. The people had met to discuss\r\nlawlessness. They refused to be put off. The adjourned meeting refused\r\nto adjourn. There were cries of =Drive Ruef out of Town=. One speaker, A.\r\nB. Truman, denounced Ruef as a grafter. For the moment an outbreak\r\nseemed imminent. At this crisis, Acting Mayor Gallagher appeared.\r\n\r\n\"I would suggest,\" he announced,[72] \"that you disperse to your\r\nrespective homes.\"\r\n\r\nCitizens who did not care to participate in what threatened to become a\r\nriot began leaving the park. But Ruef's henchmen did not leave.\r\n\r\nRuef, who had cowered in fright when the crowd was denouncing him, was\r\nconcealed in a room in the so-called Little St. Francis Hotel, which\r\nafter the fire had been erected in Union Square Park. From his hiding\r\nplace he could see the crowd without being seen. At the right time, he\r\nappeared on the steps of the building which were used for the speaker's\r\nstand. His followers, now in a majority, cheered him wildly. The next\r\nmoment, Ruef was in control of the meeting which had been called to\r\nprotest against the conditions in San Francisco, for which the\r\nadministration, of which he was the recognized head, was held to be\r\naccountable.[73] The first serious attempt to oust Ruef from his\r\ndictatorship had failed.\r\n\r\nBut while the protestants against prevailing conditions were hot with\r\nthe disappointments of this failure, District Attorney Langdon issued a\r\nstatement that he had determined to seize the opportunity presented by\r\nthe impanelment of a new Grand Jury to inaugurate a systematic and\r\nthorough investigation into charges of official graft and malfeasance in\r\noffice. To assist in this work, he announced, Francis J. Heney had been\r\nrequested to become a regular deputy in the District Attorney's office,\r\nand had accepted. That the investigation might not be handicapped by\r\nlack of funds, Mr. Langdon stated Rudolph Spreckels had guaranteed that\r\nhe would personally undertake the collection from public-spirited\r\ncitizens of a fund to provide for the expenses necessary to make the\r\ninvestigation thorough.[74] It became known that William J. Burns, who\r\nhad been associated with Heney in the Oregon land-fraud cases, had been\r\nretained to direct the investigation, and that for several months his\r\nagents had been quietly at work.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these announcements was immediate. All talk of \"vigilante\r\ncommittee\" and \"lynching\" ceased. The case of The People of San\r\nFrancisco vs. the Schmitz-Ruef Administration was to be presented in an\r\norderly way in the courts.\r\n\r\nAnd the united press of San Francisco, legitimate business interests,\r\nand a great majority of the people welcomed the alternative.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [48] See Keane's testimony in The People vs. Ruef, No. 1437, Part 3,\r\n      vol. 1, page 455.\r\n\r\n [49] See footnote 41, page 43.\r\n\r\n [50] Supervisor Gallagher testified in the case of The People vs.\r\n      Ruef, No. 1437, that about a week before the fire \"Mr. Ruef\r\n      stated that the United Railroads wanted to secure a permit to\r\n      use electricity upon their lines and asked me to speak to the\r\n      members of the Board of Supervisors about it and let him know\r\n      whether it could go through the Board, and about what amount of\r\n      money it would take. I told him that I would do so.\" (See\r\n      Transcript on Appeal, page 850.) Similar testimony, to show\r\n      that the United Railroads was dealing with Ruef during the\r\n      month preceding the fire, was brought out at trials of other\r\n      defendants in the \"graft\" cases. This would make the date of\r\n      Ruef's activity on behalf of the United Railroads about the\r\n      time of Mr. Calhoun's announcement that he would proceed to\r\n      present plans for the trolley system, to the \"proper\r\n      representatives\" of the People (the Supervisors), who were even\r\n      then, through Ruef, receiving bribe money from public-service\r\n      corporations.\r\n\r\n      Gallagher testified further (see same transcript, page 853)\r\n      that within a week after the fire Ruef stated to him that the\r\n      United Railroads still wanted its electric permit, and directed\r\n      that Gallagher find out whether such a permit could be put\r\n      through the Board. Gallagher testified that he saw members, put\r\n      the question to them, and reported back to Ruef that in his\r\n      judgment the permit could be put through by paying each member\r\n      of the Board the amount which Ruef had specified, $4,000.\r\n\r\n [51] Supervisor Gallagher testified at graft trials that Ruef had\r\n      told him the payment of this $75,000 to the Relief Fund was a\r\n      good thing, as it would tend to shut off adverse criticism. But\r\n      the Home Company people had asked that the money be not turned\r\n      over to the Relief Fund until such time as the ordinance\r\n      granting the franchise had been approved or the matter\r\n      definitely determined.\r\n\r\n [52] As early as May 5, C. E. Loss, a railroad contractor, came out\r\n      with the proposition that the city should abandon all idea of\r\n      conduit systems, because the cable slots had been closed by the\r\n      earthquake. In this, Loss was disputed by City Engineer Thomas\r\n      P. Woodward. Woodward, in an interview printed in the Examiner\r\n      on May 5, 1906, said:\r\n\r\n      \"I think Mr. Loss was mistaken when he said the earthquake\r\n      closed the cable slots. I have not made a careful examination\r\n      of the various roadbeds in San Francisco, but from what I have\r\n      seen as I have gone about the city, I am inclined to think that\r\n      no injury was done the cable slots by the earthquake.\r\n\r\n      \"The lines on Sacramento, California, Geary, Sutter and Haight\r\n      streets appear to be all right outside the burned district.\r\n      Where the metal was subjected to the intense heat, the slots\r\n      are warped out of shape, and in some places closed.\"\r\n\r\n      Loss's allegations called forth the following editorial comment\r\n      in the Examiner of May 5th:\r\n\r\n      \"Even an earthquake shock and a conflagration do not long\r\n      obscure the vision of certain wealthy gentlemen where there is\r\n      a chance to turn a calamity to their individual account.\r\n\r\n      \"Before the catastrophe, San Francisco had indicated with great\r\n      emphasis to the United Railroads that it would not permit the\r\n      reconstruction of the cable system into an overhead trolley,\r\n      but would insist upon a modern up-to-date conduit electric\r\n      railroad, the safety, utility and efficiency of which had been\r\n      demonstrated in New York and other Eastern cities.\r\n\r\n      \"The emergency created by the destruction of the traffic\r\n      systems in the city has compelled permission for a temporary\r\n      trolley line because it could be constructed more quickly than\r\n      any other.\r\n\r\n      \"It is not intended, and the United Railroads must be made to\r\n      realize that it will not be permitted, that the unsightly poles\r\n      and dangerous wires will be allowed to cumber the new and more\r\n      beautiful San Francisco, any more than it will be permitted\r\n      that the rough shacks and sheds which temporarily shelter the\r\n      people in parks and streets and otherwise vacant lots shall\r\n      remain after the emergency which called them into being has\r\n      ceased.\"\r\n\r\n [53] A. D. Shepard, vice-president and secretary of the Geary-street\r\n      Railroad Company, gave the following statement to the Examiner\r\n      as to the condition of the Geary-street roadbed:\r\n\r\n      \"We can run cars as far as the road goes, but the power-house\r\n      is not ready for business. The smokestack at Geary and Buchanan\r\n      streets must be built up to comply with the ordinance of the\r\n      city before we can get a permit to build fires under the\r\n      boilers. The smokestack should be repaired by the end of this\r\n      week, and cars will probably be run over the road then. I\r\n      cannot say just what day we will begin to run cars. All depends\r\n      upon the smokestack and the Board of Public Works.\r\n\r\n      \"Our line was not injured by the earthquake, and we ran cars\r\n      for some time after the shake.

The Call said:\r\n\r\n      \"The insolent disregard of public rights in the streets by the\r\n      United Railroads is inspired, of course, by ulterior purpose to\r\n      entrench the corporation in the possession of privileges,\r\n      permits or franchises granted at a time of stress and confusion\r\n      whose legality may and probably will be questioned later.\r\n\r\n      \"The Call does not desire to assume an attitude of hindering or\r\n      hampering progress. We recognize fully that every new\r\n      street-car line adds materially to the value of property within\r\n      its tributary territory. In a word, the growth of a city or a\r\n      neighborhood is, to a considerable degree, dependent on\r\n      facilities for urban transit.\r\n\r\n      \"But it does not follow from these considerations that\r\n      franchises should be granted for nothing to any and every\r\n      applicant who is able to construct a street railway. The right\r\n      to use the streets is the most valuable privilege possessed by\r\n      a municipality. It should be made to yield a corresponding\r\n      revenue.\r\n\r\n      \"All this might seem so obvious as scarcely to require\r\n      statement, but in practice the principles here laid down have\r\n      been virtually disregarded in San Francisco. In no instance was\r\n      there more flagrant disregard of public rights than in the\r\n      wholesale grants of permits or franchises to construct overhead\r\n      trolley lines made after the fire.\r\n\r\n      \"The United Railroads at the time professed to regard these\r\n      permits as merely temporary, but that profession was not very\r\n      long maintained. The company now declares that many, if not\r\n      all, of these permits amount to absolute franchises in view of\r\n      the capital invested in making the necessary changes. That is\r\n      the explanation of the outrageous disregard of public rights\r\n      shown in tearing up some five or six miles of streets at once\r\n      and in different parts of town. This process is obviously\r\n      wasteful as a financial proposition, and is calculated besides\r\n      to arouse general indignation. We find these weighty\r\n      considerations disregarded on the advice of the corporation's\r\n      lawyers, to bolster up an invalid claim to the possession of\r\n      franchises obtained by trick and device in an hour of public\r\n      confusion.\r\n\r\n      \"What the extent of the corporation's claim under these permits\r\n      may be we are not advised, and there is no immediate means of\r\n      finding out as long as the administration which granted these\r\n      hole-and-corner permits remains in power. The same influences\r\n      that made the Mayor and Supervisors so complaisant to the will\r\n      of the United Railroads are still operative. It was only the\r\n      other day that another permit for a street-car line was\r\n      granted, and granted illegally. This administration stays\r\n      bought.\r\n\r\n      \"Therefore, the streets are torn up in a dozen different parts\r\n      of town and left in that condition untouched for months with\r\n      the full consent of the administration. But this political\r\n      condition is not permanent. Some of these people will go to\r\n      jail. They will all be ousted at the next election. San\r\n      Francisco has had enough of them.\r\n\r\n      \"The United Railroads is endeavoring to fortify one wrong by\r\n      committing another. These things will not be forgotten in a\r\n      hurry. We are convinced that the corporation is pursuing a\r\n      shortsighted policy. Costly litigation must ensue to test the\r\n      validity and extent of the overhead trolley permits. The people\r\n      will not consent to see their most valuable property traded\r\n      away by a lot of conscienceless boodlers, and if it should\r\n      prove that the United Railroads has been able to make two\r\n      wrongs constitute one right, it is very certain that a movement\r\n      of irresistible force will follow for a reduction of street-car\r\n      fares.\r\n\r\n      \"We are convinced that it will pay the United Railroads to be\r\n      fair and decent with the people of San Francisco. The present\r\n      policy is neither fair nor decent. The service is bad, public\r\n      rights in the streets are outraged, and, worst of all, the\r\n      corporation is the most malign, corrupting influence in the\r\n      politics of our municipal government. There will come a\r\n      reckoning.\"\r\n\r\n [57] See statement printed in San Francisco Examiner, May 4, 1906.\r\n\r\n [58] Calhoun's letter to the Supervisors read:\r\n\r\n                          \"United Railroads of San Francisco.\r\n                                 \"President's Office.\r\n                                      \"San Francisco, May 14, 1906.\r\n\r\n      \"To the Honorable Board of Supervisors of the City of San\r\n      Francisco--Gentlemen: The United Railroads of San Francisco\r\n      respectfully represents that, notwithstanding its urgent and\r\n      earnest efforts to provide adequate street railway\r\n      transportation on the lines being operated, constant pressure\r\n      is being applied and innumerable requests are being presented\r\n      to it to increase its transportation facilities.\r\n\r\n      \"The company is anxious to please the people, and is willing to\r\n      do its part in the immediate upbuilding of the Greater San\r\n      Francisco, but owing to the unavailability of material and\r\n      machinery for operating its cable systems, as well as the great\r\n      length of time necessary to rebuild destroyed power-houses and\r\n      reconstruct its cable conduits, a long time would necessarily\r\n      elapse before the cable systems could be operated so as to give\r\n      the required relief to traffic congestion.\r\n\r\n      \"If your Honorable Board will permit the use on the cable lines\r\n      of a standard electric system such as is now used on the\r\n      company's other lines, we will be glad to put all of our lines\r\n      in commission, and will agree to have them in complete\r\n      operation wherever grades will permit as rapidly as the most\r\n      liberal expenditure of money and the largest possible\r\n      employment of men will accomplish.

The Examiner,\r\n      in its issue of May 15, said:\r\n\r\n      \"The United Railroads, with the rapacity for which it has ever\r\n      been noted, is seeking to capitalize the city's woe to its own\r\n      advantage.\r\n\r\n      \"Before the disaster of April 18 it had been balked in its\r\n      purpose to make San Francisco a trolley town. The protests of\r\n      citizens who knew that the underground system is better than\r\n      the cheap, unsightly trolley system and had been proved safer,\r\n      had blocked the United Railroads project. And it seemed certain\r\n      that the scheme to cumber Market street and Sutter street with\r\n      poles and wires was definitely stopped.\r\n\r\n      \"The emergency which demanded the swiftest possible\r\n      establishment of a transportation system, gave the United\r\n      Railroads its opportunity to revive the discreditable scheme.\r\n      As an emergency service nobody could object to the overhead\r\n      trolleys. But it was understood that the service was absolutely\r\n      temporary in its character and should only obtain during the\r\n      pendency of present conditions.\r\n\r\n      \"Yesterday, however, there appeared out of the void of\r\n      forbidden things an ordinance that was hastily passed to print,\r\n      granting a franchise to the United Railroads to trolleyize its\r\n      whole system.\r\n\r\n      \"It was expected evidently that this iniquitous measure could\r\n      be sneaked through under cover of the present stress and\r\n      excitement without people realizing until it was too late what\r\n      had been done.\r\n\r\n      \"When the scheme was flushed it was still attempted to make it\r\n      appear that this was a temporary measure, a representation\r\n      absolutely varying with the language of the ordinance.\r\n\r\n      \"But the scheme has not succeeded yet.\r\n\r\n      \"It was to be expected that, like the looters who have to be\r\n      kept from other people's property by soldiers and police, San\r\n      Francisco's misfortune would bring out a horde of corporate\r\n      ghouls eager to snatch privileges during the time of disorder.\r\n      But it was likewise to be expected that the city\r\n      administration, which has been so alert to protect private\r\n      property, would be equally alert to protect the precious\r\n      possessions of the city.\r\n\r\n      \"The railroads can only do what the city permits, and a strong\r\n      official scrutiny of the ordinance which was yesterday passed\r\n      to print should result in its final defeat.\r\n\r\n      \"No matter what other claims an administration may have to the\r\n      gratitude and respect of the citizens of San Francisco, it\r\n      cannot afford to be known as the administration that put\r\n      trolley poles on Market street.\"\r\n\r\n [60] The day that the ordinance granting the trolley permit was\r\n      ordered printed, Mayor Schmitz stated in an interview as\r\n      published in the Examiner:\r\n\r\n      \"The proposed franchise is merely a temporary measure. It does\r\n      not mean that the United Railroads can indefinitely operate\r\n      their cars by the overhead trolley in Market street, or in the\r\n      streets formerly occupied by cable roads. It is necessary now\r\n      to have transportation. The cable roads cannot be repaired, I\r\n      am told, for some time. Meanwhile, the franchise to string\r\n      overhead wires has been granted. It can be revoked.\"\r\n\r\n [61] At the Calhoun trial, William H. Sanderson testified to having\r\n      been introduced to Calhoun by Ruef at a public meeting, a few\r\n      days before the trolley permit was granted. He was then asked:\r\n\r\n      \"Q. What, if any, conversation then ensued between yourself,\r\n      Mr. Ruef and Mr. Calhoun? A. Well, I stated--Mr. Calhoun was at\r\n      that time sitting at a large table in the room, where the\r\n      committee had held its session, and he rose out of his seat,\r\n      and the three of us held a conversation following that\r\n      introduction. I stated to Mr. Calhoun--I asked him when the\r\n      people of North Beach were or might expect railroad facilities,\r\n      that the population was coming back to that portion of the\r\n      city, and that other portions of the city were provided with\r\n      facilities, and that we were compelled to walk through miles of\r\n      burned district in order to get anywhere; and Mr. Calhoun said\r\n      in reply, that if the people of San Francisco desired railroad\r\n      facilities, they should co-operate with the railroad company\r\n      that was here to provide them with the same; and I said to Mr.\r\n      Calhoun that I thought that we were ready to do anything that\r\n      the company desired us to do, and asked him what in particular\r\n      he wished us to do, and he said: 'There is that trolley\r\n      privilege matter before the Supervisors; that comes up next\r\n      Monday, and you people of San Francisco ought to come down\r\n      before that Board, that the people of San Francisco, or you,\r\n      are vitally interested in the matter of this trolley permit.'\r\n      Mr. Ruef then said: 'Come down before the Board next Monday,\r\n      Sanderson, and make a talk on behalf of your organization in\r\n      favor of the trolley permit. We will see that you get the\r\n      privilege of the floor. A number of citizens of San Francisco\r\n      will be there, and we propose to show the press that the people\r\n      of San Francisco are behind this permit.' I said to Mr.\r\n      Calhoun: 'The papers tell me that this is a very valuable\r\n      franchise and you ought to pay the city something for it.' And\r\n      Mr. Calhoun said in substance that he thought that the company\r\n      would be paying all that the privileges was worth if it built\r\n      the road. Then I suggested to him that perhaps that sentiment\r\n      which objected to the disfigurement of Market street and Sutter\r\n      street by the erection of poles and wires, ought to be placated\r\n      to some extent, and I asked him why he would not at least put\r\n      the feed-wires under ground; and he said that that would entail\r\n      an expense which the company at that time was not or did not\r\n      think it advisable to meet. And then I asked him why he would\r\n      not put the poles 200 feet apart instead of 100 as--or 200 feet\r\n      apart, as was done in European cities, and he said that the\r\n      100-foot system was the more advisable in his opinion. And then\r\n      Mr. Ruef said to me: 'The passage of this permit will mean\r\n      immediate work for 5,000 men. We will be able to take them out\r\n      of the camps and put them at work.' And I said to Mr. Ruef:\r\n      'That is all very well, Mr. Ruef, but it seems to me that there\r\n      is another side to this question--a political side. The people\r\n      of San Francisco are at last all behind your administration.\r\n      What they need in this crisis is leadership, and we will have\r\n      to take such leadership as you give us; and now that everybody\r\n      is with you, and even the Bulletin has quit, it is not good\r\n      policy on your part to stir up another newspaper war. The\r\n      Examiner has been your friend ever since Schmitz was first\r\n      elected, and it will not swallow the trolley proposition in its\r\n      present form, and it is charging your administration with\r\n      corruption. If it persists in its fight it will eventually\r\n      break your back. It seems to me that it would be a\r\n      comparatively easy matter to placate this opposition by\r\n      exacting some compensation for this permit, either in the way\r\n      of cash or by way of a percentage of the proceeds of the road,\r\n      or you might limit it as to time; give them a permit for five\r\n      or ten years. You have them at your mercy and they are bound to\r\n      accept whatever terms you prescribe.' Mr. Ruef then said: 'To\r\n      hell with the Examiner, no public man can afford to swallow\r\n      that paper. This thing will go through on Monday. It is all\r\n      settled.' And then I said: 'You don't need me then,' and Mr.\r\n      Calhoun said: 'I don't think we do, Mr. Sanderson.' That is all\r\n      the conversation, or that is substantially all the conversation\r\n      that took place in regard to that matter.\"\r\n\r\n [62] Said the Examiner in its issue of May 16, 1906: \"It looks very\r\n      much as if Patrick Calhoun, Thornwell Mullally and their pals\r\n      of the United Railroads had sneaked up behind San Francisco\r\n      just as she lay wounded from earthquake and conflagration. In\r\n      the guise of helping her, they were caught picking her pocket.\r\n      If the Supervisors aid and abet them, the people will be\r\n      warranted in setting up their effigies in lasting bronze, a\r\n      group of everlasting infamy, with the inscription: 'THESE MEN\r\n      LOOTED SAN FRANCISCO AT THE TIME OF THE GREAT FIRE OF 1906.'\"\r\n\r\n [63] Of the failure to exact pay for the franchise, the Examiner of\r\n      May 17, 1906, said:\r\n\r\n      \"Mayor Schmitz and the Board of Supervisors must know, and if\r\n      they do not know they are now informed, that the franchises\r\n      they propose to give away to the United Railroads are worth a\r\n      great deal of money to the city of San Francisco, and they\r\n      certainly do know that the city never was so greatly in need of\r\n      money as now. To give away so much of value at such a time is\r\n      so hideous a crime that it will leave a scar upon the\r\n      reputation of everybody concerned in it, no matter what that\r\n      reputation has been up to the time of the infamy.\"\r\n\r\n [64] The Supervisors' letter to the Examiner was as follows:\r\n\r\n                                \"San Francisco, Cal., May 26, 1906.\r\n\r\n      \"To 'The San Francisco Examiner,' City--Gentlemen: The Board of\r\n      Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco, regretting\r\n      the hostile stand which your journal has in these distressing\r\n      times assumed toward the rebuilding of our destroyed city, by\r\n      indiscriminately attacking every vested interest and all\r\n      intending investments of capital in this city, respectfully\r\n      submits for your consideration the propriety of joining with\r\n      instead of assailing those who are in good faith and with their\r\n      energy and ability striving to restore and rebuild our beloved\r\n      city.\r\n\r\n      \"Irrespective of any personal feeling caused by your wanton\r\n      attacks on his Honor the Mayor, and on this Board, we ask of\r\n      you, as citizens of San Francisco and as the legislative branch\r\n      of our government, to cease your thoughtless and dangerous\r\n      efforts to drive away from our city every interest which has\r\n      expressed its intention to assist in our rebuilding and which\r\n      has manifested a practical confidence in our future.

After Ruef had been convicted and the\r\n      Appellate Court had refused to grant him a new trial, Henshaw,\r\n      before the briefs had been filed in the matter of the appeal\r\n      from the Appellate to the Supreme Court, signed an order\r\n      granting Ruef a new hearing. See Chapter XXIX.\r\n\r\n [67] See decisions in Edson vs. The Southern Pacific Co., 133 Cal.\r\n      Reports and 144 Cal. Reports.\r\n\r\n [68] Nor was this criticism confined to San Francisco; it was\r\n      general throughout the State. The Sacramento Bee, in describing\r\n      the conditions prevailing at San Francisco, said:\r\n\r\n      \"In the hold-ups which are now terrorizing the people of San\r\n      Francisco the citizens are seeing the effects of a loose or\r\n      dishonest municipal administration. The form of lawlessness now\r\n      prevailing in San Francisco follows upon bad local government\r\n      as inevitably as night follows day.\"\r\n\r\n [69] Definite figures, alleged to be the graft schedule enforced in\r\n      the San Francisco tenderloin after the fire, were published.\r\n      The Chronicle of April 24, 1907, said on this score:\r\n\r\n      \"After the great disaster of last April, or so soon as the new\r\n      tenderloin began to build up and the Barbary Coast district\r\n      began to establish itself, a schedule of prices for protected\r\n      vice was formulated. This schedule has been rigidly adhered to.\r\n      In the case of houses of ill-fame, the proprietors were\r\n      required to pay the policemen on the beat the sum of $5, the\r\n      sergeants $15, the captains $25, and the chief of police $75 to\r\n      $100 every week for the privilege of conducting their nefarious\r\n      business. The gambling houses were assessed according to their\r\n      ability to pay, but the average price for police protection,\r\n      according to Heney, was about the same as the houses of\r\n      prostitution. The dives along Pacific street and in the Barbary\r\n      Coast district were required to pay $50 every week to the\r\n      police captain and the chief, those two functionaries\r\n      presumably dividing the money. The sporting saloons where women\r\n      of the night life congregate were taxed a similar amount.\"\r\n\r\n [70] Ruef advised strongly against Schmitz leaving San Francisco. In\r\n      an interview printed in the San Francisco Call, May 16, 1907,\r\n      the day after he had plead guilty to a charge of extorting\r\n      money from French restaurant dives, Ruef said:\r\n\r\n      \"The great mistake of this whole thing began with the Mayor's\r\n      trip to Europe. The Mayor had been proclaimed as the man of the\r\n      hour after the disaster of last April. He was suddenly seized\r\n      with the desire of making a trip to Europe, where he expected\r\n      to be received as one of the crowned heads. He thought his fame\r\n      would spread throughout the world and he hoped to be lionized\r\n      abroad and, incidentally, gain social prestige. The whole thing\r\n      was a mistake. I begged him not to go. I pointed out to him\r\n      that the city was in ruins and the place for the Mayor was at\r\n      home. He persisted, and all my pleadings were in vain.\"\r\n\r\n [71] At a preliminary meeting of the organizers of this movement,\r\n      held in the office of the California Canners, October 10, 1906,\r\n      responsibility for the state of affairs in San Francisco was\r\n      charged to Ruef. It was stated at this meeting, and given out\r\n      to the press, that convincing evidence had been secured against\r\n      Ruef which warranted his prosecution.\r\n\r\n [72] Acting Mayor Gallagher was emphatic in declaring that no\r\n      vigilance committee should disgrace San Francisco. The interior\r\n      press, which was following the San Francisco situation closely\r\n      and from an independent standpoint, advised Mayor Gallagher\r\n      that the best way to prevent organization of such a committee\r\n      would be to enforce the laws. Said the Stockton Record:\r\n\r\n      \"If Acting Mayor Gallagher and his associates wish to abate the\r\n      agitation in favor of a committee of safety for San Francisco,\r\n      they should do less talking and take more energetic action\r\n      against the thug element. The police department of the\r\n      afflicted city is now virtually on trial. It is even under\r\n      suspicion of offenses graver than that of inefficiency. One or\r\n      two more crimes of violence with well-known people as victims\r\n      will fire the public indignation of San Francisco to a point\r\n      where incapable officers will be forced aside and an authority\r\n      created to meet the grave emergency confronting respectable\r\n      citizenry.\"\r\n\r\n      The Stockton Independent went even further. Said that paper of\r\n      the San Francisco situation:\r\n\r\n      \"Acting Mayor Gallagher of San Francisco declares there shall\r\n      be no vigilance committee and no lynching in San Francisco. If\r\n      he and the police are unable to prevent daily murders, or\r\n      attempted murders, by single criminals, how can he prevent good\r\n      citizens in hundreds of thousands from lynching those criminals\r\n      if they catch them? Perhaps some of the purblind members of the\r\n      police force may be among the first to be lynched.\"\r\n\r\n [73] After Ruef's capture of the Union Square meeting, Rev. P. C.\r\n      Macfarlane, pastor of the First Christian Church at Alameda,\r\n      said in a sermon (October 21, 1906) of the San Francisco\r\n      situation:\r\n\r\n      \"Let a few resolute, clean-handed business men of San Francisco\r\n      who are not cowards, who are not quitters or grafters, get\r\n      together and make a purse of twenty, fifty or a hundred\r\n      thousand dollars, then employ the ablest attorney to be had and\r\n      set quietly to work to find the graft and punish the grafters.\r\n      They could make chapel exercises on Sunday afternoon in San\r\n      Quentin look like a political rally in San Francisco inside of\r\n      two years.\r\n\r\n      \"Thus Eugene E. Schmitz stands before the world as a man who\r\n      tried to reform and could not. He is a moral inebriate. He is a\r\n      welcher. He is a wanderer on the face of the globe, a man\r\n      without country, expatriated by his own cowardice. This is Dr.\r\n      Jekyll.\r\n\r\n      \"But there are some who see in Schmitz Mr. Hyde. These do not\r\n      give the Mayor credit for even a spasm of virtue and say that\r\n      the great work of the morning of April 18 was done by General\r\n      Funston and prominent citizens of their own volition. These\r\n      people say that he has now gone from San Francisco, taking with\r\n      him vast sums of money gained through the granting of the\r\n      trolley franchise, plotted even while the embers smoldered, and\r\n      that he will never return.\r\n\r\n      \"The United Railroads is universally believed to have acquired\r\n      its trolley franchises by corrupt means. It is said that\r\n      prominent merchants will crane and crook and bow and scrape to\r\n      get a nod of recognition from Abe Ruef. Ruef has used the\r\n      advantages given him by the state of affairs to corrupt the\r\n      greatest city in California. Ruef owns the Board of\r\n      Supervisors. The Police Commissioners belong to him. The\r\n      saloon-keeper who wants a license, a corporation that wants a\r\n      favor from the Board of Supervisors, has only to retain Ruef as\r\n      an attorney at a fee sufficiently large.\"\r\n\r\n      Dr. Macfarlane gave expression to what many thoughtful men were\r\n      thinking, but of which few with interests at San Francisco\r\n      dared to admit openly.\r\n\r\n [74] Mr. Langdon's statement was published October 21, 1906. It was\r\n      in full as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"In view of the present extraordinary conditions prevalent in\r\n      the City and County of San Francisco, the unusual increase in\r\n      crime, which threatens to grow worse as the winter sets in, and\r\n      in view of the numerous charges of official graft and\r\n      malfeasance in office, I have determined to seize the\r\n      opportunity presented, by the impanelment of a new grand jury,\r\n      which has been set down for next Wednesday by Hon. Thomas F.\r\n      Graham, the Presiding Judge of the Superior Court in the City\r\n      and County of San Francisco, to inaugurate a systematic and\r\n      thorough investigation into these conditions. It is my official\r\n      duty to do so, and in pursuance of that duty and in view of the\r\n      magnitude of the task, I have decided to seek the best\r\n      assistance obtainable. It is my purpose to set at rest these\r\n      charges of official graft by either proving them false or\r\n      convicting those who are guilty. If the charges be untrue,\r\n      their falsity should be demonstrated to the world, so as to\r\n      remove the impressions which have been circulated to the injury\r\n      of the credit and fair name of the city. If they be true we\r\n      should show to the country that there is enough strength,\r\n      virtue and civic pride in our people to enable the regularly\r\n      constituted machinery of justice to re-establish conditions on\r\n      a clean, righteous and just basis, without resort to any\r\n      extraordinary expedients outside the law. This is to be an\r\n      honest, fair, thorough and searching investigation. We shall\r\n      protect no man. We shall persecute no man, but we shall\r\n      prosecute every man who is guilty, regardless of position or\r\n      standing in the city. In order that we may have the benefit of\r\n      expert services in this work I have requested Mr. Francis J.\r\n      Heney, who has won national fame for his work in the\r\n      prosecution of the Oregon land fraud cases, to become a regular\r\n      deputy in my office. Mr. Heney has accepted. It is unfortunate\r\n      that this work should be commenced during a political campaign,\r\n      but the conditions in San Francisco to-day require that radical\r\n      action be taken at once, and though I may be charged with\r\n      instituting this investigation at this particular juncture for\r\n      political advantage, I must ask the public to judge me by the\r\n      results attained, which will be the best answer.\r\n\r\n      \"I am not unmindful of the great difficulties involved in this\r\n      investigation. It will be both laborious and costly. The money\r\n      available under the appropriations made to the District\r\n      Attorney's office and the grand jury is, of course, utterly\r\n      inadequate. Often previous investigations by other grand juries\r\n      have been made abortive because of this lack of necessary funds\r\n      to meet expenses. In the present instance we shall not suffer\r\n      this severe handicap. I am authorized to announce that Mr.\r\n      Rudolph Spreckels has guaranteed that he will personally\r\n      undertake the collection from public-spirited citizens of a\r\n      fund to provide for the expenses necessary to make the\r\n      investigation thorough and so that good results may ensue. The\r\n      city is in deep affliction consequent upon the dreadful\r\n      calamities of last spring; it is in danger from certainly\r\n      increasing invasion of desperate criminals from all over the\r\n      world; some of the public departments are undoubtedly in bad\r\n      hands, and I appeal to my fellow-citizens to give this\r\n      investigation their moral support, so that the innocent may be\r\n      protected, so that the guilty may be punished, and so that San\r\n      Francisco may be helped to her feet and started again on the\r\n      high road of prosperity in her material conditions, and have\r\n      restored decency, efficiency, honesty and honor in her public\r\n      affairs.\r\n                              \"WILLIAM H. LANGDON, District Attorney.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                         GRAFT PROSECUTION OPENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days after the announcement of his plans, District Attorney\r\nLangdon appointed Heney to a regular deputyship. But even before Langdon\r\nhad taken office, as early as December, 1905, Fremont Older, editor of\r\nthe San Francisco Bulletin, had suggested to Heney that he undertake the\r\nprosecution of those responsible for conditions in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe Bulletin had been the most fearless and consistent of the opponents\r\nof the Schmitz-Ruef regime.[75] After Ruef's complete triumph at the\r\nNovember election in 1905, he boasted that he would break the Bulletin\r\nwith libel suits. With every department of government in his control,\r\nRuef appeared to be in a position where, even though he might not be\r\nable to make good his threat, he could cause the Bulletin much annoyance\r\nif not great financial loss.\r\n\r\nOlder went on to Washington to engage Heney to defend the paper, should\r\nRuef attempt to make his boast good. Heney gave Ruef's threats little\r\ncredence. \"I would be very glad to defend you,\" he told Older, \"but I am\r\nafraid I'll never get a chance to earn that fee.\"[76]\r\n\r\nIncidentally Older stated that he believed a fund could be raised to\r\nprosecute the corrupters of the San Francisco municipal government, and\r\nasked Heney if he would undertake the prosecution, if such a fund could\r\nbe secured.\r\n\r\nHeney replied that he would be glad to undertake it, but stated that at\r\nleast $100,000 would be required. And even with this amount, Heney\r\npointed out to Older, all efforts would be futile, unless the District\r\nAttorney were genuinely in sympathy with the movement to better\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nOn Heney's return to California early in 1906, Older brought him and\r\nRudolph Spreckels[77] and James D. Phelan together. Heney and Spreckels\r\nmet for the first time. Phelan vouched for Langdon's[78] integrity and\r\nhonesty of purpose. Indeed, Langdon was already giving evidence of his\r\nindependence of the Ruef organization. Up to that time no attempt had\r\nbeen made to raise the funds necessary to conduct a practical\r\ninvestigation. Phelan stated that he would subscribe $10,000 and\r\nSpreckels agreed to give a like amount. Spreckels undertook to look the\r\nfield over and expressed confidence that he could get twenty men who\r\nwould subscribe $5000 each, making the $100,000 which Heney had declared\r\nto be necessary for the undertaking. The question of Heney's fee was\r\nthen raised.[79]\r\n\r\n\"If there be anything left out of the $100,000 we will talk about fee,\"\r\nHeney replied. \"But I don't think there will be anything left and I will\r\nput up my time against your money.\"\r\n\r\nIt was practically settled at this meeting that Heney should devote\r\nhimself to the prosecution of corruptionists against whom evidence might\r\nbe secured. He returned to Washington early in March to wind up his\r\naffairs there. Before he could return to San Francisco, came the\r\nearthquake and fire.\r\n\r\nHeney got back to San Francisco April 25, one week after the disaster.\r\nHe had another conference with Spreckels.[80] Spreckels told him that he\r\nwanted the investigation begun at the earliest possible moment, and that\r\nhe (Spreckels) would himself guarantee the expenses which might be\r\nincurred.[81] Heney notified Burns, and as early as June[82] Burns had\r\nbegun the investigation that was to result in the downfall of Ruef, and\r\nthe scattering of his forces.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the following October, Heney had so arranged his\r\naffairs as to be free to devote himself to the San Francisco\r\ninvestigation. His appointment as Deputy District Attorney followed.\r\n\r\nIn view of one of the principal defenses advanced by Ruef and his\r\nallies, namely, that the graft prosecution was undertaken to injure the\r\nUnited Railroads, these dates are important. The services for which the\r\nbribe money which got the United Railroads into difficulties was paid,\r\nwere not rendered until May 21, 1906, long after final arrangements had\r\nbeen made for Burns to conduct the investigation and Heney to assist in\r\nthe prosecution. The actual passing of the United Railroads bribe money\r\nwas not completed until late in August[83] of that year. Burns was at\r\nwork, and had received pay for his services before the bribe-giving for\r\nwhich United Railroad officials were prosecuted had taken place.[84]\r\n\r\nLangdon's announcement that he would appoint Heney as a Deputy District\r\nAttorney, to assist in investigating into charges of official\r\ncorruption, brought upon him the condemnation of the municipal\r\nadministration and of the leaders of the Union-Labor party. P. H.\r\nMcCarthy and O. A. Tveitmoe, who, from opposing the Union-Labor party\r\nmovement in 1901-3 had, by the time the Graft Prosecution opened, become\r\nprominent in its councils, were particularly bitter in their\r\ndenunciations. At a Ruef-planned mass meeting held at the largest\r\nauditorium in the city October 31, 1906, for the purpose of organizing a\r\nleague for the protection of the administration, Langdon was dubbed\r\n\"traitor to his party,\" a man \"who has gone back on his friends,\" \"the\r\nBenedict Arnold of San Francisco.\"\r\n\r\nHeney was denounced as \"the man from Arizona.\" On the other hand Mayor\r\nSchmitz was called \"the peerless champion of the people's rights,\" and\r\nRuef, \"the Mayor's loyal, able and intrepid friend.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Egan, one of the organizers of the Union-Labor party, stated of\r\nthe graft prosecution: \"This movement, led by Rudolph Spreckels and\r\nengineered by James D. Phelan, conceived in iniquity and born in shame,\r\nis for the purpose of destroying the labor organizations and again to\r\ngain control of the government of our fair city.\"\r\n\r\nRuef, in an earnest address, insisted upon his innocence of wrongdoing.\r\n\"As sure as there is a God in heaven,\" he announced solemnly, \"they have\r\nno proof as they claim.\"[85]\r\n\r\nActing Mayor Gallagher issued a statement in which he took the same\r\nground as had Egan at the Dreamland Rink mass meeting, that the\r\nprosecution was a movement on the part of the Citizens' Alliance to\r\ndisrupt the labor unions.[86]\r\n\r\nFrom another angle, officials of public service corporations charged\r\nthose identified with the investigation with being in league with the\r\nlabor unions. In one of his statements to the public, Patrick Calhoun,\r\npresident of the United Railroads, set forth that, \"I confidently expect\r\nto defeat alike the machinations of Rudolph Spreckels, his private\r\nprosecutor, with his corps of hired detectives, and Mr. Cornelius,\r\npresident of the Carmen's Union, the leader of anarchy and lawlessness,\r\nand to see fairly established in this community the principles of\r\nAmerican liberty, and the triumphs of truth and justice.\"[87]\r\n\r\nThen, too, there were points at which the two supposed extremes,\r\ncorporation magnates and Labor-Union politicians, touched in their\r\nopposition to the prosecution. At a meeting held on November 2, 1906,\r\nless than two weeks after Heney's appointment, John E. Bennett,\r\nrepresenting the Bay Cities Water Company, read a paper in which Heney\r\nand Langdon were denounced as the agents of the Spring Valley Water\r\nCompany. The Chronicle, in its issue of November 3, charged that the\r\npaper read by Mr. Bennett was type proof of a pamphlet that was to be\r\nwidely distributed, and that the proof sheets had been taken to the\r\nmeeting by George B. Keane, secretary of the Board of Supervisors.[88]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, practically the entire press of the city,[89] the\r\ngeneral public and many of the labor unions gave the prosecution\r\nunqualified endorsement, welcoming it as opportunity, in an orderly way,\r\neither to establish beyond question, or to disprove, the charges against\r\nthe administration of incompetency and corruption.[90] Rudolph\r\nSpreckels's statement, that \"this is no question of capital and labor,\r\nbut of dishonesty and justice,\"[91] was generally accepted as true\r\nexpression of the situation.\r\n\r\nThose directly connected with allegations or suggestion of irregular\r\npractices, issued statements disclaiming any knowledge of irregularity\r\nor corruption. General Tirey L. Ford, chief counsel of the United\r\nRailroads, in a published interview,[92] stated that no political boss\r\nnor any person connected with the municipal administration had\r\nbenefited financially to the extent of one dollar in the trolley permit\r\ntransaction, and that had any one profited thereby, he (Ford) in his\r\nofficial capacity would have known of it. Those connected with the\r\nadministration were as vigorous in their denials.[93] Many of them\r\nexpressed satisfaction at the prospect of an investigation. Supervisor\r\nKelly went so far as to suggest that the municipality give $5000 to\r\nassist in the inquiry. \"Let us,\" said Supervisor Lonergan, \"get to the\r\nbottom of this thing. These cracks about graft have been made right\r\nalong, and we should have them proved or disproved at once.\"\r\n\r\nBut in spite of this brave front, the developments of the years of\r\nresistance of the graft prosecution show the few days following Heney's\r\nappointment as Assistant District Attorney to have been a period of\r\nintense anxiety to Ruef and his immediate advisers. Ruef held daily\r\nconsultations with Acting Mayor Gallagher, Clerk Keane, and his\r\nattorney, Henry Ach. The public knew little of these consultations, but\r\na rumor became current that Mayor Gallagher would suspend District\r\nAttorney Langdon from office. Little credence was given this, however.\r\nNevertheless, on the night of October 25 Acting Mayor Gallagher\r\nsuspended Langdon from office, and appointed Abraham Ruef to be District\r\nAttorney to conduct the graft investigations.[94]\r\n\r\nThe following morning the San Francisco Call, under a large picture of\r\nRuef, printed the words: \"THIS MAN'S HAND GRIPS THE THROAT OF SAN\r\nFRANCISCO.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [75] The persecution of the Bulletin during this period was\r\n      characteristic of Ruef's methods and reflected the state of\r\n      lawlessness which prevailed in San Francisco. R. A. Crothers,\r\n      proprietor of the paper, was assaulted and badly beaten. The\r\n      newsboys organized into a union. The boys were sincere enough,\r\n      but the movement was in reality engineered from the tenderloin.\r\n      Soon a strike of newsboys against the Bulletin was inaugurated.\r\n      Copies of the paper were snatched from the hands of citizens\r\n      who purchased it. Bulletin carriers and agents were assaulted.\r\n      Tugs of its delivery wagons were cut. When the paper was\r\n      delivered to stores, sticks and stones were thrown in after it.\r\n      The police did not interfere. The manifestations of lawlessness\r\n      went unchecked. Libel suits were brought against the Bulletin.\r\n      Business boycotts were attempted against it.\r\n\r\n [76] See address made by Heney before Citizens' League of Justice in\r\n      October, 1908.\r\n\r\n [77] Rudolph Spreckels, although connected with large enterprises,\r\n      had steadfastly refused to employ Ruef as an attorney, or to\r\n      join with him in any way. Given control of the San Francisco\r\n      Gas Company, for example, although he was importuned to do so,\r\n      Spreckels refused to employ Ruef as attorney for that company.\r\n      Spreckels testified at the trial of The People vs. Patrick\r\n      Calhoun, that he had first realized the necessity of proceeding\r\n      against Ruef and the Ruef-Schmitz administration when Ruef\r\n      proposed to him to organize a syndicate to purchase San\r\n      Francisco municipal bonds. Spreckels testified that Ruef set\r\n      forth his plan as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"He (Ruef) asked me if I would get together a syndicate for the\r\n      purpose of bidding on these bonds; that he would guarantee that\r\n      if I did get up such a syndicate, our bid would be a successful\r\n      bid; that we would not be obliged to bid above par, and that he\r\n      would guarantee that we would be the successful bidders. My\r\n      reply to Mr. Ruef was that I could not understand how anybody\r\n      could make such an agreement or promise, and how did he propose\r\n      to make such a statement--to carry out what he had stated. He\r\n      said: 'Why, that is a simple matter. You know my connection\r\n      with the Labor Unions and the Labor Union party. Just at the\r\n      time that the bids are about to come in, I will arrange to tie\r\n      up this town; we will have the biggest strike that the\r\n      community has ever known, and I would like to see any of your\r\n      bankers or your capitalistic friends bid on the bonds under\r\n      those circumstances, excepting yourself, those that are in the\r\n      know'--words to that effect, was his expression. I said to Mr.\r\n      Ruef: 'Do you mean to say, Mr. Ruef, that for the purpose of\r\n      making money you would bring about a strike which might entail\r\n      even bloodshed, for the mere sake of making money?' And Mr.\r\n      Ruef flushed up and said: 'Oh, no; I was only joking.' And he\r\n      soon withdrew from my office.\"\r\n\r\n      It is interesting to compare Spreckels' attitude toward Ruef\r\n      with that of I. W. Hellman, as shown by Hellman's testimony at\r\n      the trial of Tirey L. Ford. See footnote 7, page 15.\r\n\r\n [78] Heney, in his address on the work of the Graft Prosecution,\r\n      October, 1908, paid Langdon the following high tribute:\r\n\r\n      \"Mr. Langdon, as soon as we laid the matter before him and\r\n      convinced him it was in good faith and not to serve private\r\n      interests, said: 'Yes, I will appoint Mr. Heney assistant in my\r\n      office and give him full sway to make a thorough investigation,\r\n      on one condition, and that is that I am kept personally in\r\n      touch with everything going on at all times. I am District\r\n      Attorney and I propose to be District Attorney and to act upon\r\n      my own judgment.' And there never has been a time that Mr.\r\n      Langdon didn't have absolute sway over all matters, and did not\r\n      wholly consent to what was done, and he has had the final say\r\n      in everything, and I wish to say that there is more credit due\r\n      to him than to any of us. He had a greater personal sacrifice\r\n      to make.\r\n\r\n      \"The first thing he had to take into consideration was that he\r\n      had gone into office as the candidate of the Labor party, and\r\n      he knew he would be called a traitor and denounced if it\r\n      appeared that any man who had been on the same ticket as he had\r\n      been elected upon had been grafting. He had to possess more\r\n      moral than physical courage, and a higher kind of moral\r\n      courage, and that courage was exercised to the credit of San\r\n      Francisco as well as to the credit of Mr. Langdon.\"\r\n\r\n [79] The Graft Defense labored without success to make it appear\r\n       that Heney was compensated for his service. Out of the\r\n       Prosecution fund, the expenses--rental, clerical hire,\r\n       etc.--of offices, so far as they were maintained especially\r\n       for the work of the Graft Prosecution, were paid. These were\r\n       known as \"Heney's offices.\" When Rudolph Spreckels was on the\r\n       stand at the Calhoun trial, he testified under Heney's\r\n       announcement that the Defense could ask him any question it\r\n       chose and no objection would be made. Earl Rogers, for\r\n       Calhoun, endeavored to make it appear that Heney was getting\r\n       pay.\r\n\r\n      \"Mr. Spreckels,\" Rogers asked, \"in addition to paying Mr.\r\n      Heney's office expenses, amounting to five or six hundred\r\n      dollars a month, have you paid other expenses for Mr. Heney?\"\r\n\r\n      \"No, sir,\" Spreckels replied.\r\n\r\n      Heney, the testimony all through shows, received not a dollar\r\n      to compensate him for his services to the city; moreover, it\r\n      shows that he had given up business which would have brought\r\n      him large fees, that he might be free to conduct the Graft\r\n      Prosecution. See transcript Calhoun trial, pages 3837 and on,\r\n      3746, 3743, etc.\r\n\r\n      The efforts of well-compensated attorneys for the Defense to\r\n      make it appear that Heney was paid for his work, furnish one of\r\n      the amusing features of the graft trials.\r\n\r\n [80] The conference was held on May 10 or 11. This was four days\r\n      before the Supervisors took the preliminary steps toward\r\n      granting the United Railroads its overhead trolley permit, and\r\n      several months before the bribe money was paid.\r\n\r\n [81] See testimony of Rudolph Spreckels at trial of The People vs.\r\n      Patrick Calhoun, No. 1436.\r\n\r\n [82] Al McKinley was the first detective put to work for the Graft\r\n      Prosecution. On May 25, 1906, Chief Burns detailed him to\r\n      watch Ruef. Later, June 19, 1906, Burns directed Robert Perry\r\n      to shadow Ruef. Perry did so until nearly a year later, when\r\n      Ruef was placed in the custody of an elisor.\r\n\r\n [83] That prosecution of officials of the United Railroads was not\r\n      thought of when the graft prosecution was begun, was brought\r\n      out at the trial of The People vs. Patrick Calhoun, No. 1436.\r\n      The following, for example, is taken from Rudolph Spreckels'\r\n      testimony:\r\n\r\n      \"Mr. Heney--Q. At the time that Mr. Phelan agreed to contribute\r\n      the $10,000, Mr. Spreckels, what did you say, if anything,\r\n      about contributing yourself? A. That was in the first meeting,\r\n      I think, Mr. Heney, and I told him that I was ready and willing\r\n      to contribute a similar amount: that I believed it would be\r\n      possible to get others to join and contribute.\r\n\r\n      \"Q. At that time was anything said by any person about\r\n      prosecuting Mr. Calhoun? A. Absolutely no.\r\n\r\n      \"Q. Or any person connected with the United Railroads Company?\r\n      A. The discussion was entirely confined to the administration,\r\n      the corrupt\r\n\r\n      \"Q. At that time did you have any purpose or intention of\r\n      prosecuting Mr. Calhoun? A. I had not.\r\n\r\n      \"Q. Did you have any reason to believe that Mr. Calhoun at that\r\n      time had committed any crime? A. I had no indication of such a\r\n      crime.\r\n\r\n      \"Mr. Moore--Was that time fixed, Mr. Heney?\r\n\r\n      \"Mr. Heney--Yes, it was fixed; the first conversation, and he\r\n      has fixed it as nearly as he could.\r\n\r\n      \"The Court--Have you in mind the testimony on that point, Mr.\r\n      Moore? There was some reference to it in an earlier part of the\r\n      examination.\r\n\r\n      \"Mr. Heney--Q. When you had the talk with Mr. Heney in April,\r\n      1906, did you say anything about prosecuting Mr. Calhoun, or\r\n      anybody connected with the United Railroads? A. I did not.\r\n\r\n      \"Q. Did you at any time tell Mr. Heney that you desired to have\r\n      him prosecute Mr. Patrick Calhoun? A. I did not, at any time.\r\n\r\n      \"Q. Did you tell him at any time that you desired to have him\r\n      prosecute any person connected with the United Railroads\r\n      Company? A. I did not.\" See transcript The People vs. Patrick\r\n      Calhoun, No. 1436, page 3730.\r\n\r\n [84] Rudolph Spreckels testified at the trial of The People vs.\r\n      Patrick Calhoun, No. 1436:\r\n\r\n      \"Mr. Perry was employed to get information in regard to Mr.\r\n      Abraham Ruef and the city administration as early as June,\r\n      1906, and his efforts and of one other man employed at that\r\n      time were directed toward that and that only.\"\r\n\r\n [85] See San Francisco newspapers, November 1, 1906.\r\n\r\n [86] Gallagher's statement was in full as follows:\r\n\r\n      It seems to me that these assaults that are being made upon\r\n      Mayor Schmitz are exceedingly reprehensible. It is strange that\r\n      the gentlemen who are making the attacks did not see fit to\r\n      make them while Mayor Schmitz was here. Especially does this\r\n      apply to Langdon, who, by reason of past association with Mayor\r\n      Schmitz, and favors received by him from the Mayor, should have\r\n      been the last man to attempt to besmirch the Mayor in his\r\n      absence. I am satisfied that all these attacks upon the\r\n      administration officials have their origin in the\r\n      long-continued attempt on behalf of the Citizens' Alliance to\r\n      disrupt the labor organizations of the city. An administration\r\n      that is friendly to organized labor is an impassable obstacle\r\n      in the way of such a purpose. The enormous amount of labor of\r\n      all kinds that will have to be performed in this city during\r\n      the next few years has undoubtedly prompted the organizers of\r\n      the old Citizens' Alliance to renew their assaults upon the\r\n      officials elected by the Union Labor party in the hope that\r\n      they may thereby themselves secure control of the municipal\r\n      administration and thus work out their own will in the matter\r\n      of the conditions under which labor shall perform the task of\r\n      rebuilding this city.\r\n\r\n      \"So far as I am concerned personally, I consider that the\r\n      disruption of the labor organization would be a great sacrifice\r\n      of the interests of all of the people. The city must be built\r\n      up; but the Citizens' Alliance and all organizations and\r\n      individuals in sympathy with it may as well understand, first\r\n      as last, that the work will only be done through organized\r\n      labor, and not by the employment of pauper labor in competition\r\n      with the mechanics and artisans of the labor unions.\r\n\r\n      \"That this view of the situation is well recognized by the\r\n      labor organizations of the city is shown by the action of the\r\n      Building Trades Council last night in approving and indorsing\r\n      my action in removing Mr. Langdon.\"\r\n\r\n [87] Contained in a statement published May 18, 1907. See San\r\n      Francisco papers of that date.\r\n\r\n [88] The nature of the attacks upon the supporters of the\r\n      Prosecution is shown by the proceedings in the libel suit\r\n      brought by the San Francisco First National Bank against the\r\n      Oakland Tribune. Rudolph Spreckels was president of the bank;\r\n      the Tribune was one of the stanchest of the opponents of the\r\n      prosecution. The Tribune charged that the Graft Prosecution\r\n      had for one of its objects the unloading of the Spring Valley\r\n      Water Company's plant upon San Francisco, and that the First\r\n      National Bank was burdened with Spring Valley securities.\r\n      Among other things the article set forth:\r\n\r\n      \"The recent disclosures of the methods by which it was sought\r\n      to unload Spring Valley's old junk, called a distributing\r\n      system, together with its inadequate supply of inferior water,\r\n      on the city at an outrageous figure by the swinging of the 'big\r\n      stick' has not enhanced the value of the securities of the\r\n      corporation in the view of the national examiners. Even the\r\n      efforts to cloud the real purposes of the promoters of the\r\n      Spring Valley job by calling it a civic uprising to stamp out\r\n      municipal graft is said to have failed to mislead the Federal\r\n      experts. The suggestion that the 'big stick' would force the\r\n      city to purchase the plant of the decrepit corporation for\r\n      $28,000,000 after its real estimate was appraised by an expert\r\n      at $5,000,000 and held by the bondholders to be worth, as\r\n      realty speculation, $15,000,000, has not enthused the Federal\r\n      bank examiners in relation to the value of Spring Valley bonds\r\n      as security for a national bank.\"\r\n\r\n      The First National Bank did not hold Spring Valley Company\r\n      securities. As the Tribune's charges were calculated to injure\r\n      the bank, action for libel followed. At the hearings, it\r\n      developed that the articles had been furnished the Tribune by\r\n      the political editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, who\r\n      testified that he was paid fifty dollars a week for his Tribune\r\n      articles. This was more than his salary as political editor of\r\n      the Chronicle. He admitted on the stand that he had heard what\r\n      he stated in his article, \"only as a matter of gossip.\"\r\n\r\n [89] The San Francisco Call, in an editorial article, printed\r\n      October 22, expressed the general sentiment in San Francisco.\r\n      The Call said:\r\n\r\n      \"San Francisco will welcome the undertaking by Mr. Francis J.\r\n      Heney of the duty to search out and bring to justice the\r\n      official boodlers and their brokers that afflict the body\r\n      politic. Public opinion is unanimous in the belief that\r\n      Supervisors have been bribed and that administrative functions\r\n      such as those of the Board of Works and the Health Board have\r\n      been peddled in secret market. Even the Board of Education is\r\n      not exempted from suspicion.\r\n\r\n      \"These convictions, prevailing in the public mind, call for\r\n      verification or refutation. The sudden affluence of certain\r\n      members of the Board of Supervisors, the current and generally\r\n      credited reports that the United Railroads paid upward of\r\n      $500,000 in bribes to grease the way of its overhead trolley\r\n      franchise, the appearance of public officials in the guise of\r\n      capitalists making large investments in skating rinks and other\r\n      considerable enterprises--these and other lines of\r\n      investigation demand the probe. If there has been no dishonesty\r\n      in office the officials should be the first to insist on a\r\n      thorough inquiry.\r\n\r\n      \"If it is true, as we believe, that official boodling has been\r\n      the practice, a systematic inquiry will surely uncover the\r\n      crimes. It is impossible to commit such offenses where so many\r\n      are concerned without leaving some trace that can be followed\r\n      and run to earth. The crimes of the gaspipe thugs seemed for\r\n      the moment hidden in impenetrable mystery, but patient search\r\n      discovers the trail that leads to conviction. Criminals are\r\n      rarely men of high intelligence. They betray themselves at one\r\n      or other turn of their windings. We are convinced that some of\r\n      our Supervisors and not a few of the executive officials\r\n      appointed by Schmitz are in no degree superior in point of\r\n      intelligence and moral sense to the gaspipe robbers.\r\n\r\n      \"Mr. Heney's record as a remorseless and indefatigable\r\n      prosecutor of official rascals is known. He will have the\r\n      assistance in his new work of Mr. William J. Burns, who did so\r\n      much to bring to light the Oregon land frauds. Those crimes\r\n      were surrounded and protected by fortifications of political\r\n      influence that were deemed impregnable. When the inquiry was\r\n      first undertaken nobody believed it would ever come to\r\n      anything. It was a slow business, even as the mills of the gods\r\n      grind slowly, but if fine the grist of the criminal courts of\r\n      Oregon is large and satisfying.\r\n\r\n      \"The people of San Francisco have been sorely tried. Fire and\r\n      earthquake we cannot help, but the unhappy city has been made\r\n      the prey of a set of conscienceless thieves who have done\r\n      nothing since our great calamity beyond promoting schemes to\r\n      fill their own pockets. Our streets, our sewers, our schools\r\n      and our public buildings have been neglected, but the sale of\r\n      permits and franchises, the working of real estate jobs and the\r\n      market for privileges of every variety have been brisk and\r\n      incessant. Officials have grown rich: Some of them are spending\r\n      money like a drunken sailor. It is time for housecleaning and a\r\n      day of reckoning. Heney and Burns will put the question: 'Where\r\n      did they get it?'\"\r\n\r\n [90] Bishop Montgomery, of the Roman Catholic Church, in an\r\n      interview in the San Francisco Call, October 20, 1906, said in\r\n      reference to the San Francisco graft prosecution:\r\n\r\n      \"Mere accusations have been so long and so persistently made\r\n      that the public has a right to know the truth; and, above all,\r\n      those who are innocently so charged have a right to a public\r\n      and complete vindication. Nothing now but a thorough and honest\r\n      investigation can clear the atmosphere and set us right before\r\n      the world and with ourselves.\r\n\r\n      \"I have such confidence in the courts of California that I\r\n      believe no innocent man needs to fear that he will suffer from\r\n      them, and no guilty man has any just right to complain.\r\n\r\n      \"I believe the investigation has been undertaken in good faith\r\n      for the best interests of the city, and that it will be\r\n      conducted thoroughly and honestly.\"\r\n\r\n [91] Mr. Spreckels' statement was contained in an interview printed\r\n      in the San Francisco Call, October 28, 1906. It was as\r\n      follows:\r\n\r\n      \"This is no question of capital and labor,\" he said, \"but of\r\n      dishonesty and justice. There is no association of men,\r\n      capitalists or others, behind what we have undertaken, and it\r\n      cannot be made a class question. No one knows that better than\r\n      Ruef. And it will be impossible for him to fool the workingman\r\n      by these insinuations.\r\n\r\n      \"I want the workingmen of this city to recall that meeting\r\n      which was recently held in Union Square. I was asked to attend\r\n      that meeting and be its chairman. I refused to preside, to\r\n      speak or go there unless I could be assured that it was not to\r\n      be a movement of the capitalistic class on the one hand against\r\n      the workingmen on the other. And because I did not receive that\r\n      assurance I did not attend. Mr. Heney stayed away for the same\r\n      reason.\r\n\r\n      \"Now, who was it that originated that meeting? Sam Shortridge.\r\n      Who was it who drew the resolutions; who was it who prompted\r\n      the speakers and the chairman? It was Sam Shortridge.\r\n\r\n      \"Mr. Ruef says that meeting was dominated and arranged by the\r\n      Citizens' Alliance. Very well. Then let Mr. Ruef explain to the\r\n      workingmen why it was that a few days afterward he hired Sam\r\n      Shortridge as his attorney.\r\n\r\n      \"I believe that it is impossible to fool the laboring men of\r\n      this city now. Absolutely and definitely I want to say to them\r\n      that there is nothing behind this movement but the desire for a\r\n      clean city. It is absolutely regardless of class. Every man who\r\n      owns a home, who has a family, is as much interested in what we\r\n      have undertaken as is the wealthiest citizen.\"\r\n\r\n [92] See San Francisco Examiner, October 28, 1906, from which the\r\n      following is taken: \"=Of course there was no bribery= (said\r\n      General Ford), =nor offer to bribe, nor was there anything done\r\n      except upon clean and legitimate lines=.\"\r\n\r\n      \"Q. General, if any bribe, or offer to bribe, had been made by\r\n      your company to any person connected with the San Francisco\r\n      municipal administration, or to any political boss having\r\n      control of the same, or if any member of the Board of\r\n      Supervisors, or of the municipal government had benefited to\r\n      the extent of one dollar financially by the agreement to grant\r\n      to the United Railroads the privilege desired, you, in your\r\n      official capacity, would undoubtedly be aware of it, would you\r\n      not? A. I am certain that I would; I am, therefore, equally\r\n      certain that no such thing was ever done or contemplated.\"\r\n\r\n [93] The following are excerpts from interviews published in the San\r\n      Francisco Examiner, October 23, 1906:\r\n\r\n      Abraham Ruef: \"I am satisfied that if Mayor Schmitz had known\r\n      that this investigation was afoot he would have postponed his\r\n      trip abroad and would have remained here to disprove all\r\n      allegations of graft.\"\r\n\r\n      Supervisor Andrew Wilson: \"I shall be glad to welcome any\r\n      investigation as to my official acts or as to my official\r\n      conduct. I never took a dishonest dollar in my life.\"\r\n\r\n      Supervisor Patrick McGushin: \"The more they investigate, the\r\n      better I shall like it. I do not believe Mr. Heney has any\r\n      evidence of graft. Speaking for myself, he can investigate me\r\n      or my bank account if he likes.\"\r\n\r\n      Acting Mayor James L. Gallagher: \"So far as the administration\r\n      is concerned from the statements I have received, everything is\r\n      straight. So far as the Police Department is concerned no one\r\n      can tell. I can not tell.\"\r\n\r\n      Supervisor Jennings Phillips: \"This investigation will be a\r\n      good thing. There has been so much talk of graft and so many\r\n      accusations that it all will be settled once and for all. If\r\n      Mr. Heney has any evidence I know nothing of its nature nor\r\n      against what part of the administration it is directed.\"\r\n\r\n      Supervisor Edward Walsh: \"As a Supervisor I have tried to do my\r\n      best. I court an investigation. I do not pay much attention to\r\n      Mr. Heney's statements. I have been here thirty-seven years and\r\n      I can hold up my head, as can every other member of this\r\n      Board.\"\r\n\r\n      Supervisor Michael Coffey: \"Nothing would afford me more\r\n      pleasure than to have them investigate my integrity and my\r\n      official acts.

Davis: \"I think there is nothing to this whole\r\n      thing. If Mr. Heney can find out anything let him do it. It is\r\n      hard to have insinuations cast at you. My personal connection\r\n      with the administration has been straight.\"\r\n\r\n      Supervisor F. P. Nicholas: \"There has been so much noise about\r\n      graft that it will be a good thing to go thoroughly into the\r\n      matter. Personally I court an investigation of my official\r\n      acts. If Mr. Heney has any evidence of corruption I know\r\n      nothing of it.\"\r\n\r\n      Supervisor Daniel Coleman: \"These loud cries of graft that have\r\n      been current of late will be silenced through this\r\n      investigation. It should be thoroughly gone into so that the\r\n      purity of the administration cannot hereafter be questioned.\"\r\n\r\n      Supervisor Max Mamlock: \"I do not think it is worth my while to\r\n      think about this investigation. I do not see where Mr. Burns or\r\n      Mr. Heney could get any evidence of graft.\"\r\n\r\n [94] Acting-Mayor Gallagher's order removing Langdon is printed in\r\n      full in the appendix. One of the charges alleged against\r\n      Langdon was that he had appointed Francis J. Heney to be his\r\n      deputy for ulterior purposes. Of Heney it was alleged that he\r\n      had \"in a public speech in said city and county (San\r\n      Francisco), aspersed the character and good name of a\r\n      prominent citizen of this community (Abe Ruef), and stated\r\n      that he knew him to be corrupt, etc.\"\r\n\r\n      Acting-Mayor Gallagher's order of removal was made in persuance\r\n      of Sections 18 and 19 of Article XVI of the San Francisco\r\n      Charter, which read as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"Sec. 18. Any elected officer, except Supervisor, may be\r\n      suspended by the Mayor and removed by the Supervisors for\r\n      cause; and any appointed officer may be removed by the Mayor\r\n      for cause. The Mayor shall appoint some person to discharge the\r\n      duties of the office during the period of such suspension.\r\n\r\n      \"Sec. 19. When the Mayor shall suspend any elected officer he\r\n      shall immediately notify the Supervisors of such suspension and\r\n      the cause therefor. If the Board is not in session, he shall\r\n      immediately call a session of the same in such manner as shall\r\n      be provided by ordinance. The Mayor shall present written\r\n      charges against such suspended officer to the Board and furnish\r\n      a copy of the same to said officer, who shall have the right to\r\n      appear with counsel before the Board in his defense. If by an\r\n      affirmative vote of not less than fourteen members of the Board\r\n      of Supervisors, taken by ayes and noes and entered on its\r\n      record, the action of the Mayor is approved, then the suspended\r\n      officer shall thereby be removed from office; but if the action\r\n      of the Mayor is not so approved such suspended officer shall be\r\n      immediately reinstated.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n          RUEF'S FIGHT TO TAKE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impaneling of the Grand Jury was to have been completed on October\r\n26. Heney was appointed Assistant District Attorney on October 24. Ruef,\r\nto secure control of the District Attorney's office before the Grand\r\nJury could be sworn, had little time to act. But he was equal to the\r\nemergency. Gallagher removed Langdon and named Ruef as District Attorney\r\nthe day after Heney's appointment and the day before the impaneling of\r\nthe Grand Jury was to have been completed.\r\n\r\nRuef had, however, considered Langdon's suspension from the day of the\r\nDistrict Attorney's announcement of his plans for investigating graft\r\ncharges. Gallagher testified at the graft trials that Ruef had, several\r\ndays before Langdon's suspension, notified him it might be necessary to\r\nremove Langdon from office[95]. The Acting Mayor expressed himself as\r\nready to carry out whatever Ruef might want done.\r\n\r\nGallagher testified that the names of several attorneys, including that\r\nof Henry Ach, Ruef's attorney and close associate, were canvassed as\r\neligible for appointment as Langdon's successor. Nothing definite was\r\ndecided upon, however, until the day that Langdon's position was\r\ndeclared vacant. On that day, Gallagher received word from Ruef to call\r\nat his office. There, according to Gallagher's statement, he found\r\nThomas V. Cator, a member of the municipal Board of Election\r\nCommissioners. Henry Ach came in later.\r\n\r\nRuef told Gallagher that he had decided it was necessary to remove\r\nLangdon, and that he had decided to take the place himself. Gallagher\r\nassured Ruef that whatever Ruef decided in the matter he, the Acting\r\nMayor, would stand by. The papers removing Langdon had already been\r\nprepared. Gallagher read them over, for typographical errors, he states\r\nin his testimony, and signed them.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Supervisors was to have met that day at 2:30 P. M. in\r\nregular weekly session. Gallagher, as Acting Mayor, was to preside. But\r\nit was well after 6 P. M. when Gallagher arrived, from Ruef's office, at\r\nthe council chamber.\r\n\r\nHe appeared worried and disturbed. The Supervisors, who had been waiting\r\nfor him for nearly four hours, were called to order. The communication\r\nremoving Langdon was read and adopted without debate or opposition.[96]\r\nGallagher then announced that he had appointed Ruef to be Langdon's\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\nHow completely Ruef dominated the municipal departments was shown by the\r\nfact that he filed his bond, his oath of office, and his certificate of\r\nappointment at the various municipal offices without hint of what was\r\ngoing on reaching the public. Ruef had commanded secrecy, and secrecy\r\nwas observed. After Gallagher had announced Ruef's appointment in open\r\nmeeting of the Supervisors, the filing of the papers was made public.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Supervisors, in open board meeting, endorsed Gallagher's\r\naction without apparent hesitation, nevertheless the abler among them\r\ndid so with misgivings. Supervisor Wilson went straight from the meeting\r\nof the board to Ruef's office. He told Ruef that in his judgment a\r\nmistake had been made; that the papers would call the removal of Langdon\r\nconfession of guilt.[97] But Ruef laughed at his fears, and to cheer\r\nhim up, took him to a popular restaurant for dinner.\r\n\r\nBut before leaving his office, Ruef performed his first act as District\r\nAttorney. He wrote a curt note to Heney, dismissing him from the\r\nposition of assistant.[98] Later in the evening he appointed as Heney's\r\nsuccessor Marshall B. Woodworth.\r\n\r\nThe order of dismissal was delivered to Heney within ten minutes.\r\nHeney's answer reached Ruef as he sat at dinner with Supervisor Wilson\r\nand Henry Ach, who had joined the group. Heney's reply was quite as\r\npointed as Ruef's letter of dismissal. Heney stated he did not recognize\r\nRuef as District Attorney.\r\n\r\nThe battle between the two forces was fairly on. Ruef and his\r\nassociates, as they sat at dinner, discussed the advisability of taking\r\npossession of the District Attorney's office that night, but concluded\r\nto wait until morning. In this Ruef suffered the fate of many a general\r\nwho has consented to delay. When morning came, District Attorney Langdon\r\nhad his office under guard, and San Francisco was aroused as it had not\r\nbeen in a generation.\r\n\r\nSupervisor Wilson had not misjudged the interpretation that would be\r\nplaced upon Langdon's suspension. The Call the following morning\r\ndenounced Ruef as \"District Attorney by usurpation; a prosecuting\r\nofficer to save himself from prosecution.\" The Chronicle set forth, in\r\na biting editorial article, that \"as long as they (the Ruef-Schmitz\r\ncombine) felt safe from prosecution, they jauntily declared that they\r\nwould like to see the accusations fully justified, but the instant they\r\nbegan to realize the possibility of being sent to San Quentin, they\r\nturned tail and resorted to a trick which every man in the community\r\nwith gumption enough to form a judgment in such matters will recognize\r\nas a confession of guilt.\"\r\n\r\nThe Examiner called the removal of Langdon and the appointment of Ruef,\r\n\"the last stand of criminals hunted and driven to bay.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have,\" said the Examiner, \"come to a point where they will stop at\r\nnothing.... William H. Langdon, the fearless District Attorney, and\r\nFrancis J. Heney, the great prosecutor, have driven the bribe-seekers\r\nand the bribe-takers to a condition of political madness. In hysterical\r\nfear they last night attempted their anarchistic method of defense.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bulletin devoted its entire editorial page to Ruef's new move,\r\nheading the article, \"Ruef's Illegal Action is Confession of Guilt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said the Bulletin, \"in the history of anarchy parallels in\r\ncool, deliberate usurpation of authority this latest exhibition of\r\nlawlessness in San Francisco.... Government is seized to overthrow\r\ngovernment. Authority is exercised in defiance of authority. The office\r\nof the District Attorney is seized deliberately, with malice\r\naforethought, with strategy and cunning and used as a fort for thieves\r\nto battle down the forces of citizenship. The criminals, accused of\r\nfelony, after inviting investigation and pretending to assist, have\r\nshown their hypocrisy by committing an act of anarchy which, while it\r\nmight be tolerated for the time being in San Francisco, would result in\r\nthe execution of these men in any government of Europe.\"\r\n\r\nGallagher's action, while upheld by the Union-Labor party leaders, and\r\nby the unions which these leaders dominated, was condemned by\r\nindependent labor organizations.\r\n\r\nThe Building Trades Council, with which all the building trades unions\r\nwere affiliated, dominated by P. H. McCarthy, promptly endorsed\r\nGallagher's action in removing Langdon. But many of the affiliated\r\nunions not only withheld endorsement, but some of them repudiated the\r\naction of the central body.\r\n\r\nThe Bricklayers and Masons' Union, for example, with 800 members\r\npresent, and without a dissenting vote, adopted resolutions declaring\r\nthat \"the President and Secretary[99] of the Building Trades Council are\r\nnot fit persons to be at the head of the Union movement in San\r\nFrancisco,\" and denouncing the course of the municipal administration,\r\nwhich the Building Trades Council had approved, as \"high-handed defiance\r\nof the law.\"[100]\r\n\r\nIn spite of this repudiation by the unions, Ruef issued a statement in\r\nwhich he denounced the prosecution as a movement \"to destroy the Union\r\nLabor organization and to control the situation in San Francisco in the\r\ninterest of those who are opposed to the success of the wage-earning\r\nclasses.\" He announced further, \"I have accepted this office, the first\r\npolitical position I ever held in my life, because I believe it to be my\r\nduty to the public to bring to an end this constant defamation and to\r\nstop the publication of matter detrimental to the city's growth and\r\nmaterial interest.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not intend,\" he said, \"to make any changes in the personnel of the\r\nDistrict Attorney's office until it is determined what fate Mr. Langdon\r\nshall meet, with the exception that Mr. Heney will not be retained. I\r\nwill not have Mr. Heney in my office because I do not believe that his\r\nmoral standing is equal to the position.\"[101]\r\n\r\nDistrict Attorney Langdon was out of the city when Acting Mayor\r\nGallagher announced his suspension from office. Langdon hurried back\r\nprepared to resist the executive's action.[102] Even while Ruef and his\r\nassociates were debating the advisability of taking possession of the\r\nDistrict Attorney's office that night, attorneys for the prosecution\r\nwere at work on papers in injunction proceedings to restrain Acting\r\nMayor Gallagher, the Supervisors and Ruef from interfering with the\r\nDistrict Attorney in the discharge of his duties. The papers were not\r\nready before 5 o'clock of the morning of the 26th. At that hour,\r\nSuperior Judge Seawell signed an order temporarily restraining Ruef from\r\ninstalling himself as District Attorney, and from interfering with\r\nLangdon in the discharge of his duties as District Attorney. By eight\r\no'clock that morning, Presiding Judge Graham of the Superior Court had\r\nassigned the case to Judge Seawell's department; a police officer and\r\ntwo deputy sheriffs had been installed in the District Attorney's office\r\nwith instructions to enforce the restraining order. For the time, at\r\nleast, District Attorney Langdon was secure in his office.\r\n\r\nRuef appeared two hours later. He was that morning to have represented\r\nthe defendant in a murder trial, The People vs. Denike, but began the\r\nday by formally withdrawing from the case on the ground that as District\r\nAttorney he could not appear for the defense. He appeared in the police\r\ncourts ready to prosecute a libel suit which he had brought against the\r\nproprietor of the San Francisco Bulletin, but the justice had been\r\nserved with Judge Seawell's restraining order and the libel-case hearing\r\nwas postponed. In Judge Dunne's department of the Superior Court, Ruef\r\nreceived something of a setback. The Court made a special order\r\npermitting one of Langdon's deputies to prosecute in a criminal action\r\nthen pending, regardless of who might be District Attorney. The\r\nrestraining order kept Ruef and Woodworth out of the District Attorney's\r\noffice. By noon it was evident that at the big event of that eventful\r\nday, the impaneling of the Grand Jury, Langdon, and not Ruef, would, as\r\nDistrict Attorney, represent The People.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [95] Gallagher testified at the trial of The People vs. Ruef, No.\r\n      1437, to the conversation at Ruef's law offices when Ruef first\r\n      broached the matter of Langdon's removal, as follows: \"The\r\n      substance of the conversation was that Mr. Ruef stated that it\r\n      might become necessary to remove Mr. Langdon from the office of\r\n      District Attorney, and to appoint somebody else. I replied that\r\n      that was a matter for him to make up his mind on; if he\r\n      determined it had to be done. I would do it; words to that\r\n      effect. I cannot give the exact language.\"\r\n\r\n [96] The San Francisco Chronicle, in its issue of October 26, thus\r\n      describes the proceedings attending Langdon's removal:\r\n\r\n      \"Gallagher took the chair at 6:30 p. m. and there was ten minutes'\r\n      perfunctory business.\r\n\r\n      \"His honor seemed uneasy, but at the careful prompting of\r\n      Secretary Keane, he called for 'communications from executive\r\n      officers.'\r\n\r\n      \"Keane then announced, 'From his honor, the Mayor,' and read\r\n      Gallagher's letter suspending District Attorney Langdon 'for\r\n      neglect of duty' and sundry other charges.\r\n\r\n      \"During the reading of the long document there was no sound In the\r\n      hall save the hoarse voice of Secretary Keane, and on its\r\n      completion Supervisor Sanderson arose.\r\n\r\n      \"Gallagher explained that Langdon would 'be given an opportunity\r\n      next Thursday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock to appear before the board\r\n      and defend himself against the charges.'\r\n\r\n      \"He then recognized Sanderson, who offered a motion accepting the\r\n      communication from the Mayor and directing that Langdon be\r\n      directed to appear to answer.\r\n\r\n      \"Supervisor Wilson seconded the motion.\r\n\r\n      \"Upon the call for the 'ayes,' although the Supervisors usually\r\n      let silence Indicate their consent, there was a chorus of\r\n      approval, and upon the call for the 'noes' there was dead silence.\r\n\r\n      \"Supervisors L. A. Rea and J. J. Furey were not present.\"\r\n\r\n [97] At the trial of The People vs. Ruef, No. 1437, page of\r\n      Transcript 2654, Wilson testified: \"I told him (Ruef) that I\r\n      thought it was a bad move at this time and that the papers in\r\n      the morning would state it was simply a confession of guilt;\r\n      and I said that I had stood there and taken my program on the\r\n      matter, but I felt it would ruin my chances in the face of an\r\n      election, running for Railroad Commissioner, and he said I\r\n      would feel better after I had something to eat, and we went\r\n      over to Tait's and had supper. On the way over he (Ruef) sent\r\n      Charlie Hagerty in to notify Mr. Heney of his removal.\"\r\n\r\n [98] Ruef's order dismissing Heney was as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"Mr. Francis J. Heney: You are hereby removed from the position\r\n      of Assistant District Attorney of the City and County of San\r\n      Francisco.\r\n\r\n      \"Dated. October 25, 1906.\r\n                                           \"(Signed) A. RUEF,\r\n                                        \"Acting District Attorney.\"\r\n\r\n [99] P. H. McCarthy and O. A. Tveitmoe, respectively president and\r\n      secretary of the Building Trades Council.\r\n\r\n [100] The resolutions adopted by Bricklayers' and Masons'\r\n       International Union No. 7, were as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Whereas, The office of District Attorney of San Francisco\r\n       County has been declared vacant by the Acting Mayor and\r\n       Supervisors at a time when the said District Attorney was\r\n       preparing an investigation into the official acts of the said\r\n       Supervisors and others; and\r\n\r\n       \"Whereas, One of the persons accused by the said District\r\n       Attorney of being guilty of criminal acts, has been appointed by\r\n       the Acting Mayor and Supervisors to fill the office thus vacated;\r\n       and\r\n\r\n       \"Whereas, The Building Trades Council of San Francisco has\r\n       indorsed the action of the administration, and the president and\r\n       secretary of said Council has aided and abetted said usurpation\r\n       of power to the utmost of their ability; therefore, be it\r\n\r\n       \"Resolved, That this Union condemn the action of the Council in\r\n       this matter, and that we condemn the president and secretary of\r\n       the Council for lending or selling their aid to help to prevent\r\n       the investigation of the public acts of officials who have thrown\r\n       themselves open to suspicion, and thereby placing the honest\r\n       union men of San Francisco in the false light of indorsing such\r\n       high-handed defiance of the law; and be it\r\n\r\n       \"Resolved, That we deny that the proposed prosecution of the\r\n       present administration is an attack on organized labor; and\r\n       further, be it\r\n\r\n       \"Resolved, That it is the sense of this Union that the president\r\n       and secretary of the Building Trades Council are not fit persons\r\n       to be at the head of the Union movement in San Francisco, and\r\n       that the delegates representing this Union in the Council are\r\n       hereby instructed to use every honorable means to carry out the\r\n       spirit of this resolution; and further, be it\r\n\r\n       \"Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be furnished by the\r\n       corresponding secretary to each and every Union affiliated with\r\n       the Council, so that they will consider this an invitation from\r\n       this Union to assist in ridding the central body of officers whom\r\n       we believe have done all in their power to bring unionism into\r\n       disrepute.\"\r\n\r\n       Similar resolutions were adopted by Journeymen Plumbers, Gas and\r\n       Steam Fitters' Local, No. 442.\r\n\r\n [101] See Ruef's statement as published in the San Francisco\r\n       Chronicle, October 26, 1906.\r\n\r\n [102] Mr. Langdon, on arriving in San Francisco, issued the\r\n       following statement:\r\n\r\n       \"No person in California believes that my alleged suspension\r\n       is due to neglect or inefficiency. No dissent is necessary\r\n       before the people. It is plain that my removal is deemed\r\n       necessary by Ruef and Gallagher to prevent an honest,\r\n       searching investigation of conditions that prevail in\r\n       municipal affairs in San Francisco. Their plan will come to\r\n       naught, however.\r\n\r\n       \"As District Attorney I shall pursue this investigation to the\r\n       end. I deny the legal right of the Mayor or the Board of\r\n       Supervisors to suspend or dismiss me. The provision of the\r\n       Charter purporting to give that authority is clearly\r\n       unconstitutional. The citizens must determine whether or not\r\n       they will countenance this high-handed proceeding in a\r\n       community which is supposed to be governed by the law, and not\r\n       by the will of a boss and his puppet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                   OLIVER GRAND JURY IMPANELED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hard fight of the morning of October 26th to prevent Ruef taking\r\npossession of the District Attorney's office had been carried on\r\npractically without the general public being aware of the proceedings.\r\nLangdon had been suspended early in the evening of the previous day. The\r\ntemporary order restraining Ruef from interfering with the District\r\nAttorney had been signed at 5 o'clock in the morning. The general public\r\nfound by the morning papers that Ruef had attempted to seize the office,\r\nbut of the steps taken to stay his hand the papers had nothing. The\r\nquestion on every man's lip was: Will Judge Graham recognize Ruef or\r\nLangdon as District Attorney at the impaneling of the Grand Jury?\r\n\r\nThe court was to meet at 2 o'clock. Long before that hour arrived, the\r\nhalls of Temple Israel, a Jewish synagogue in which several departments\r\nof the Superior Court met during the months following the great fire,\r\nwere packed with citizens. The street in front of the building soon\r\nbecame jammed with a struggling mass of men demanding entrance. The\r\ncrowd became so great that none could enter or leave the building.\r\n\r\nPlain-clothes men were on all sides, and succeeded in clearing a space\r\nabout the entrance. The work of clearing the building of all who could\r\nnot show that they had business there, then began. In this work,\r\ndeference was shown Ruef's adherents. Notorious saloon-keepers,\r\nex-prize fighters and strong-arm men friendly to Ruef were permitted to\r\nremain. Opponents of the administration who protested against removal\r\nwere unceremoniously thrown out.\r\n\r\nAlthough little groups of partisans of the administration appeared in\r\nthe crowd, the citizens assembled were in the main clearly in sympathy\r\nwith the prosecution.[103] The arrival of Langdon, Heney and Spreckels\r\nwas signal for outbursts of applause. Ruef apparently appreciated the\r\nfeeling against him. He appeared guarded by two detectives of the\r\nregular police department,[104] and a body-guard of partisans. The crowd\r\nbegan to press about him. Several of his followers made motions as\r\nthough to draw revolvers. Ruef hurried into the building. To add to the\r\nconfusion, there was, planned or without planning, misunderstanding as\r\nto the room in which the hearing was to be held. The representatives of\r\nDistrict Attorney Langdon's office finding themselves misinformed as to\r\nthe meeting place, forced their way from hall to hall seeking reliable\r\ninformation. When the room was finally located, it was found to be\r\npacked with Ruef followers. The sheriff ordered the doors closed. The\r\nCourt's attention was called to this. District Attorney Langdon insisted\r\nthat the doors be opened and the crowd permitted to enter to the\r\ncapacity of the room. He pointed out that some had been admitted and\r\nothers kept out, and insisted there should be no discrimination. This\r\ncourse was taken. The crowd poured in until every available foot of\r\nstanding room was occupied.[105]\r\n\r\nEighteen of the nineteen citizens required under the California law for\r\nGrand Jury service had already been drawn at former sessions of the\r\ncourt. As soon as order had been secured, the name of the nineteenth was\r\ntaken from the jury box.\r\n\r\nThis detail over, Heney called the Court's attention to the provision of\r\nthe California law, that no person whose name does not appear on the\r\nassessment roll of the county in which he serves is eligible for Grand\r\nJury service, and that the courts have held further, that bias or\r\nprejudice of a Grand Juror against a person indicted is sufficient\r\ngrounds for setting aside the indictment. Heney then stated that he\r\nwished to examine the nineteen men as to their qualifications as Grand\r\nJurors.\r\n\r\nRuef, announcing himself as an officer of the court, arose to speak.\r\nHeney objected to Ruef appearing, if by officer of the court he meant\r\nDistrict Attorney or Acting District Attorney. Ruef answered that he\r\nappeared only in his capacity as member of the bar. On this showing he\r\nwas allowed to proceed.\r\n\r\nRuef contended that the procedure proposed by Heney was irregular; that\r\nif followed the validity of the Grand Jury would be imperiled. He stated\r\nthat he did not want to see the Grand Jury made an illegal body.\r\n\r\nHeney replied that he intended, as Assistant District Attorney, to\r\npresent felony charges against Ruef, and desired to examine the\r\nprospective Grand Jurors as to their bias for or against Ruef.\r\nFurthermore, Heney insisted, the Court had authority to excuse a juror\r\nif he were not on the assessment roll. To accept as Grand Jurors men\r\nwhose names were not on the assessment roll, or men biased or prejudiced\r\nagainst Ruef would, Heney insisted, make the proceedings a farce.[106]\r\n\r\nIn reply to Heney, Ruef defied him to produce any evidence \"in open\r\ncourt before an untutored Grand Jury for an indictment.\" Ruef charged\r\nHeney further with employing abuse \"to make the Grand Jury illegal so\r\nthat nothing might come of any indictment.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point, the Attorney General of the State, U. S. Webb,[107]\r\naddressed the Court. At his suggestion the Grand Jurors were excused\r\nfor the day. General Webb then stated that he knew of no law for the\r\nprocedure which Mr. Heney suggested. He admitted, however, that such\r\nprocedure would be desirable, and advised that no hasty action be taken\r\nin coming to a decision.\r\n\r\nHeney in reply read from California decisions to show that The People\r\nhave the authority to make examination of Grand Jurors, and continued:\r\n\r\n\"The only question remaining is as to when this examination shall be\r\nmade. Suppose the foreman of the Grand Jury is biased or prejudiced.\r\nDoes it require any argument that now is the time to make this\r\nexamination instead of waiting until we have presented our evidence to\r\nthe Grand Jury? Shall we first have to give those whom we accuse time to\r\nbribe witnesses and get them out of the country? Shall we let the\r\ndefendant come in and quash the indictment, if there is any bias or\r\nprejudice, and then be enabled to protect himself against prosecution?\r\n\r\n\"After the miserable fiasco (the attempted removal of Langdon) which\r\noccurred last night,\" Heney went on, \"what more important duty for this\r\nCourt to perform than to say immediately that the law is more powerful\r\nthan any man or any set of men in San Francisco?\"\r\n\r\nAs Heney concluded, the packed courtroom burst into applause. The crowd\r\noutside heard, took it up and cheered wildly. As soon as order was\r\nrestored, Henry Ach, one of the attorneys appearing for Ruef, suggested\r\nthat Heney, the Attorney General and himself, get together to present\r\nthe question of whether Langdon or Ruef were District Attorney to the\r\nSupreme Court. Ach stated that he feared if Langdon or Heney attended a\r\nsession of the Grand Jury and Ruef were to be found to be District\r\nAttorney, then the acts of the Grand Jury might be invalidated.\r\n\r\nHeney replied that in acting as prosecutor it had been his rule \"to have\r\nno conferences, treaties or alliances with persons charged with crime,\r\nor with their attorneys.\" On this ground, Heney declined Mr. Ach's\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\nJudge Graham made no rulings that day on any of the points raised, but\r\nordered a continuance until the following Monday.\r\n\r\nAfter adjournment of court, the appearance of Langdon and Heney at the\r\nentrance of the building brought forth cheers from the crowd that all\r\nthrough the proceedings had waited outside. A speech was demanded of\r\nLangdon.\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" he replied, \"we have no speeches to make. We have a duty\r\nto perform and we will perform that duty.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately behind Langdon came Ruef, closely guarded by police and\r\ndetectives. He was pale and worn and clearly frightened. The crowd\r\npressed about him. Threats came from his followers to shoot into the\r\ncrowd if it pressed too closely. Ruef finally reached his automobile and\r\nwas driven away.[108]\r\n\r\nThe topic of discussion of the two days that elapsed before Judge Graham\r\ndecided the questions that had been raised by Heney's proposal to\r\nproceed with the examination of the Grand Jurors, was whether Graham\r\nwould allow such examination. It was alleged that no less than four of\r\nthe citizens drawn for Grand Jury service were not on the assessment\r\nroll. There were, too, charges that Ruef controlled several of them.\r\nSome of the papers printed the names of those whom it was alleged were\r\neither under obligations to Ruef or connected with his political\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nA second crowd filled courtroom, building and street when Judge Graham's\r\ncourt was called to order the following Monday. Mounted policemen,\r\nplain-clothes men and detectives, directed by two captains of police,\r\nwere, however, on hand to preserve order.[109] There were no\r\ndemonstrations. Judge Graham announced from the bench that after due\r\ndeliberation, he had concluded that the District Attorney had the right\r\nto interrogate the Grand Jurors as to their qualifications. He stated\r\nfurther that inasmuch as Langdon was the de facto District Attorney,\r\nLangdon would conduct the examination.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution had won the first skirmish in the years-long fight upon\r\nwhich San Francisco was entering for the enforcement of the law.\r\n\r\nThe next move came from Attorney Samuel M. Shortridge. Shortridge\r\nappeared with Ruef's attorney, Henry Ach, and Marshall B. Woodworth.\r\nRuef had named Woodworth, it will be remembered, as Heney's successor in\r\nthe District Attorney's office.\r\n\r\nMr. Shortridge read Acting Mayor Gallagher's order suspending Langdon\r\nand appointing Ruef, and also called the Court's attention to the fact\r\nthat Ruef had filed his official bond as District Attorney. Shortridge\r\nstated that the matter was pending before Judge Seawell, and asked the\r\nCourt, \"in deference to Judge Seawell,\" to postpone proceedings until\r\nthe District-Attorney controversy should be decided. Shortridge\r\nexpressed himself as fearful that, if the examination of the Grand\r\nJurors went on, Judge Seawell's decision might invalidate the Grand Jury\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nW. T. Baggett, Assistant City Attorney,[110] followed Shortridge. Mr.\r\nBaggett read a letter from the Acting Mayor, setting forth the fact of\r\nLangdon's removal, and joined with Shortridge in pleading for delay. But\r\nthe pleas of both gentlemen were denied. Judge Graham repeated his\r\nopinion given earlier in the day that Langdon should be recognized as\r\nthe de facto District Attorney, and ordered the impaneling of the Grand\r\nJury to continue.\r\n\r\nShortridge thereupon announced his desire to participate in the\r\nexamination of the Grand Jurors. Heney objected to Shortridge appearing\r\nas a representative of the District Attorney's office. Shortridge\r\nreplied that he respected Judge Seawell's order, and had no intention of\r\nviolating it. He asked if he would be permitted to act in the capacity\r\nof amicus curiĆ¦[111] in examining jurors. This privilege was accorded\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe examination of the Grand Jurors occupied more than a week. Several\r\nof the nineteen were excused, it being found that their names were not\r\non the assessment roll.\r\n\r\nThe examination was concluded[112] on November 7th and the Grand Jurors\r\nsworn. B. P. Oliver was appointed foreman. From him the body received\r\nits name of Oliver Grand Jury. The Grand Jury organized by electing C.\r\nG. Burnett secretary. But one important question remained to be decided,\r\nnamely--Was Ruef or Langdon to represent The People at the investigation\r\ninto graft charges which the Grand Jury was ready to begin?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [103] The San Francisco Chronicle in its issue of October 27 thus\r\n       described the crowd: \"Every man the police put out of the\r\n       building was cheered by the crowd and every time policemen\r\n       laid hands on anyone they were hissed. However, it was evident\r\n       that the citizens who gathered outside the Temple Israel\r\n       yesterday afternoon did not come prepared to fight with the\r\n       police force. In the crowd standing outside almost every man\r\n       prominent in the business and professional life of the city\r\n       could be seen. Manufacturers, merchants, lawyers, doctors, men\r\n       engaged in all the various lines of wholesale and retail\r\n       business, and all the professions, included among the latter\r\n       being many Protestant ministers, Catholic priests and Jewish\r\n       rabbis. Here and there in the great concourse of people were\r\n       scattered little groups of men of the type that may be seen\r\n       hanging around the tenderloin.\"\r\n\r\n [104] Detectives Steve Bunner and Tim Riordan. These men accompanied\r\n       Ruef for nearly a month. Late in November, after Ruef had been\r\n       indicted, they were sent back to active duty.\r\n\r\n [105] While the crowd was pressing into the room, a deputy sheriff\r\n       undertook to search Heney for concealed weapons. Heney\r\n       complained of the officer's conduct, protested vigorously.\r\n       \"That is the man standing there,\" cried Heney, \"he did so at\r\n       the request of Abe Ruef.\"\r\n\r\n       \"Who was informed that Mr. Heney was armed,\" responded Ruef.\r\n\r\n       It developed that Heney was not armed, and the incident went\r\n       no further. But it indicated the sharpness of the division\r\n       between the two factions.\r\n\r\n [106] The Chronicle of October 27, 1906, contains the following\r\n       account of Heney's reply to Ruef: \"'I now announce to the\r\n       court,' said Heney fervently, 'that I intend as Assistant\r\n       District Attorney, to present charges of felony and\r\n       misdemeanor against Abraham Ruef, and I desire to examine the\r\n       members of this panel to determine if any member entertains\r\n       bias or prejudice for or against Abraham Ruef in the matter of\r\n       the charges which are to be presented by the District\r\n       Attorney's office. I understand that there is no question as\r\n       to Abraham Ruef's right to have the indictment set aside if\r\n       any member of the Grand Jury is biased or prejudiced against\r\n       him. It would be a farce,' Heney went on, his voice swelling,\r\n       'it would be adding to the comedy of errors enacted last night\r\n       (the attempted removal of Langdon from office), if we have a\r\n       Grand Jury which is biased or prejudiced. It has become public\r\n       through the newspapers--to some extent, at least--that Abraham\r\n       Ruef is to be investigated. The People have the same right as\r\n       the defendant to examine the members of the panel as to their\r\n       qualifications. I know that a number of the members do not\r\n       possess the qualifications provided by the statute, as they\r\n       are not on the assessment roll, and I desire to question them\r\n       on that point. The Court has the right to excuse a juror if he\r\n       is not on the assessment roll. The Supreme Court has decided\r\n       that a man has the right to be investigated by a Grand Jury of\r\n       nineteen men who are qualified according to the statute and\r\n       none others. It is not necessary to take for grand jurors the\r\n       nineteen whose names are first drawn from the box. We should\r\n       examine them, so that a member who has a bias or prejudice as\r\n       to a particular person may be instructed that he shall not\r\n       participate in the investigation of that person.'\"\r\n\r\n [107] Under the California law, the Attorney-General may at his\r\n       discretion, take the prosecution of a criminal case out of the\r\n       hands of a District Attorney. It was within General Webb's\r\n       province to have taken charge of the San Francisco graft\r\n       trials. In a statement given wide publicity at the time,\r\n       General Webb stated that he had no intention of taking charge\r\n       of the graft trials unless Ruef succeeded in seizing the\r\n       District Attorney's office. Long after, however, Heney, in an\r\n       affidavit filed in the case of The People vs. Patrick Calhoun,\r\n       Thornwell Mullally, Tirey L. Ford, William M. Abbott, Abraham\r\n       Ruef and Eugene E. Schmitz, No. 823, set forth a statement\r\n       made to him by Ruef when Ruef was pleading for immunity, in\r\n       which Webb's presence at the impaneling of the Grand Jury was\r\n       touched upon as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Ruef said in reply in substance, 'You are prejudiced against\r\n       me, Heney, ever since we had that quarrel during last\r\n       election. You know that the public-service corporations are\r\n       responsible for the conditions which exist in San Francisco\r\n       and that I can help you send some of the officials of those\r\n       corporations to the penitentiary, and I can also help you to\r\n       clean up this city and make it impossible for corruption to\r\n       get a foothold here again for a long time. You are afraid to\r\n       trust me, but you are making a mistake. The moment it becomes\r\n       known that I have gone over to the prosecution the most\r\n       powerful influences in this State will all be arrayed against\r\n       us, and particularly against me. The moment you attack Pat\r\n       Calhoun you in fact attack Herrin. You don't know the relation\r\n       between these parties and the corporation as well as I do. I\r\n       am very fond of Tirey Ford, but I don't care a rap about Pat\r\n       Calhoun, and would just as soon testify against him as not.\r\n       But the moment it becomes known that I am ready to do so my\r\n       life will no longer be safe. I will have to stick to the\r\n       prosecution from the moment I start in with it. You don't know\r\n       what desperate means these people are capable of resorting to.\r\n       My life will not be safe. If they keep me in the county jail\r\n       with O'Neil as Sheriff they will kill me to a certainty. You\r\n       don't know how many influential people are involved in this\r\n       thing. You and Burns think you know, but there are a lot of\r\n       people whom you don't know anything about who are mixed up in\r\n       it. I tell you that the combined influence of all these people\r\n       will make it next to impossible to secure convictions, and\r\n       will make it very dangerous for all of us. It will not do to\r\n       lessen the weight of my testimony any by having me plead\r\n       guilty in that extortion case. Besides that, the Court would\r\n       not allow me bail after I had pleaded guilty, and the Supreme\r\n       Court may knock out the elisor, and then I would be absolutely\r\n       in the hands of the other people, and they would surely kill\r\n       me. Sheriff O'Neil is loyal to me now, but the moment he knew\r\n       I was going to testify against Schmitz he would be very bitter\r\n       against me, and would do whatever those people wanted him to\r\n       do. Moreover, Herrin will get Attorney-General Webb to come\r\n       down and take these cases out of the hands of Langdon and\r\n       yourself, and he will declare the immunity contract off upon\r\n       the ground that the District Attorney has no power to make one\r\n       and will prosecute me on some of the bribery cases now pending\r\n       against me, and if they convict me Herrin will see to it that\r\n       I am not pardoned by the Governor. He now controls the\r\n       Governor and the chances are he will continue to name the\r\n       Governor and control him for the next twenty years. Webb was a\r\n       deputy in Ford's office when Ford was Attorney-General, and it\r\n       was Ford who got him to come down here and 'butt in' at the\r\n       time you were impaneling the Grand Jury. I know you fellows\r\n       thought it was I who got him to come down here, but as a\r\n       matter of fact I did not know any more about it than you did\r\n       until he appeared there, and I am sure it was Ford who did\r\n       it.\"\r\n\r\n [108] While Ruef was struggling through the crowd to reach his\r\n       automobile Dr. Shadwick O. Beasley, Instructor in Anatomy at\r\n       the Cooper Medical College, was assaulted by some unidentified\r\n       person. Dr. Beasley turned, shook his fist at Ruef and hissed\r\n       him. The doctor was immediately placed under arrest. Dr.\r\n       Beasley, on his part, swore out a warrant charging an unknown\r\n       deputy sheriff with battery. Beasley was then made subject of\r\n       petty persecution. He was, for example, held up on the street\r\n       by a deputy sheriff and charged with carrying a concealed\r\n       weapon. He was searched by two men, but nothing more deadly\r\n       than a case of surgical instruments was found upon him. Dr.\r\n       Beasley complained bitterly of the rough treatment from the\r\n       officers.\r\n\r\n       The San Francisco Chronicle, in its issue of October 27, 1906,\r\n       thus describes the scene which followed Ruef's appearance\r\n       before the crowd:\r\n\r\n       \"With fists and clubs Chief of Police Dinan and his squad from\r\n       the Central Police Station fought off the crowd of angry\r\n       citizens assembled about the Temple Israel who sought to lay\r\n       violent hands on Abe Ruef when the curly-headed usurper of the\r\n       functions of the municipal government was leaving the scene of\r\n       the Grand Jury meeting yesterday afternoon. And in the wake of\r\n       the police were the Ruef heelers from the tenderloin with\r\n       their hands on their pistols, threatening to shoot down the\r\n       citizens of the city of San Francisco who should dare to\r\n       approach too near the sacred person of their tenderloin idol.\r\n\r\n       \"It was one of the most remarkable scenes ever witnessed in\r\n       any city of this country. Stung with the outrageous assumption\r\n       of the powers of the public prosecutor when he was about to be\r\n       placed on trial himself for crime, the citizens of the city,\r\n       among whom are names that stand highest in business and\r\n       professional circles, sought to make him realize the impudence\r\n       of his conduct. That he escaped a swift punishment for his\r\n       arrogant seizure of the office of the District Attorney is\r\n       solely due to the presence and strenuous efforts of the\r\n       police.\"\r\n\r\n [109] In sending his officers to handle this crowd, Chief of Police\r\n       Dinan gave the following instructions:\r\n\r\n       \"The captains, sergeants and officers so detailed are\r\n       instructed that they are sent to the place designated for the\r\n       purpose of doing strict police duty. They will see that the\r\n       streets and sidewalks are not obstructed, and that no\r\n       violations of the law are permitted.\"\r\n\r\n [110] Under the San Francisco municipal charter, the District\r\n       Attorney has charge of criminal cases, and the City Attorney\r\n       of civil cases in which the city is concerned. The City\r\n       Attorney also acts as adviser to the Mayor and Board of\r\n       Supervisors. The two are independent offices.\r\n\r\n [111] Shortridge stated that as amicus curiae, it was his duty to\r\n       see that the proceedings were without flaw. Heney refused to\r\n       take him seriously, however, referred to him facetiously as\r\n       the \"curious friend of the Court.\" and suggested that the\r\n       Court unassisted might be able to determine what was competent\r\n       evidence.\r\n\r\n [112] The following nineteen citizens composed the Grand Jury that\r\n       conducted the investigation of San Francisco \"graft\" charges:\r\n\r\n       E. J. Gallagher, photographic supply dealer; Frank A. Dwyer,\r\n       real estate; Herman H. Young, baker and restaurant proprietor;\r\n       Mendle Rothenburg, liquor dealer; James E. Gordon, merchant;\r\n       Alfred Greenebaum, merchant; Wallace Wise, haberdasher;\r\n       Jeremiah Deasy, insurance agent; Rudolph Mohr, brewer; C. G.\r\n       Burnett, capitalist; Charles Sonntag, merchant; Morris A.\r\n       Levingston, liquor dealer; B. P. Oliver, real estate; W. P.\r\n       Redington, druggist; Christian P. Rode, drayman; Ansel C.\r\n       Robinson, merchant; Dewey Coffin, real estate; F. G. Sanborn,\r\n       law book publisher; Maurice Block, merchant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n              RUEF LOSES THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the impaneling of the Grand Jury was going on before Judge Graham,\r\nRuef was disputing Langdon's title to the office of District Attorney\r\nbefore Judge Seawell. In these proceedings Samuel M. Shortridge appeared\r\nwith Ruef's attorney, Ach, and Deputy City Attorney Baggett, not as\r\namicus curiĆ¦, but as Ach's associate in the legal contest to force\r\nLangdon out of office.\r\n\r\nThe principal feature of Ruef's case was the introduction of affidavits,\r\nsigned by sixteen members[113] of the Board of Supervisors, in which\r\nthe Supervisors denied committing felony of any character. Later, after\r\nthe Supervisors had confessed, these affidavits were to be used by the\r\ndefense at practically all the graft trials in efforts to break down\r\ntheir testimony against the bribe-givers.\r\n\r\nDuring the examination, Ach endeavored to force from Langdon and his\r\ndeputies a statement of what evidence they had against Ruef. In this Ach\r\nfailed. On the other hand, the prosecution sought to bring out testimony\r\nthat Ruef had directed Gallagher to suspend Langdon.[114] To this end\r\nHeney placed Ruef on the stand. But Judge Seawell stated[115] that he\r\ndid not at that time wish to go into question of motive and the point\r\nwas not pressed.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the proceedings was a second victory for the prosecution.\r\nThe injunction against Ruef was granted;[116] Langdon was left in\r\npeaceful possession of the District Attorney's office.[117] Later, Judge\r\nSeawell issued a permanent writ of prohibition against the Board of\r\nSupervisors restraining that body from removing Langdon from office.\r\n\r\nLangdon and his deputies, after a three-weeks fight, were free to\r\nproceed with the graft investigation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [113] The Supervisors who signed the affidavits exonerating Ruef and\r\n       themselves were: Charles Boxton, Jennings J. Phillips, W. W.\r\n       Sanderson, F. P. Nicholas, L. A. Rea, Edward I. Walsh, Andrew\r\n       M. Wilson, J. J. Furey, Sam Davis, C. J. Harrigan, James T.\r\n       Kelly, P. M. McGushin, Thomas F. Lonergan, Daniel G. Coleman,\r\n       Max Mamlock and M. W. Coffey. Each of them made declaration as\r\n       follows:\r\n\r\n       \"This affiant has never committed a felony of any kind or\r\n       character, and has never been a party thereto, and there is\r\n       not and can be no evidence presented of or concerning any\r\n       felony committed by the undersigned or threatened by the\r\n       undersigned. It is not true that this affiant has ever been\r\n       party to the commission of any crime or any misdemeanor.\r\n\r\n       \"This affiant further says that any and all charges,\r\n       assertions and innuendoes contained in the complaint and\r\n       contained in the public press of and concerning any alleged\r\n       felonies, misdemeanors or wrongful acts committed or alleged\r\n       to have been committed by this defendant are absolutely untrue\r\n       and false, and this affiant has never been guilty of any\r\n       violation of the law, and, so far as the knowledge of this\r\n       affiant is concerned, each and all of the other defendants\r\n       named herein are absolutely innocent of the commission of any\r\n       crime or felony or offense against the laws of the State of\r\n       California; and this affiant further says that he has no\r\n       knowledge, direct or indirect, of the commission of any felony\r\n       or of any misdemeanors or of any violations of the laws of the\r\n       State of California, or any thereof, or of the City and County\r\n       of San Francisco, by either or any of the defendants named\r\n       herein.\"\r\n\r\n       At the graft trials it developed that the Supervisors had\r\n       signed this affidavit without reading it. At the trial of The\r\n       People vs. Glass, No. 675, Supervisor Michael Coffey testified\r\n       that \"On the afternoon that affidavit was signed, I came down\r\n       late to a meeting of the board and the members of the board\r\n       were in the Notary Public's office. I went over there and met\r\n       Mr. Keane, and Mr. Keane produced that paper and asked me to\r\n       sign it, and I signed it and gave him a dollar to pay the\r\n       Notary fees. I did not read the affidavit at that time. It was\r\n       not read aloud to me while I was there. I did not talk with\r\n       any person about what was in this affidavit before it was\r\n       prepared. I did not know who prepared it.\" See page 237 of\r\n       transcript on appeal.\r\n\r\n       Supervisor Wilson testified: \"Mr. Ruef got up that affidavit,\r\n       I believe. I signed it because there was a rumor going about\r\n       that some of the Supervisors had gone over to the prosecution.\r\n       It was so stated in the public press and there was a little\r\n       excitement among the members of the board and we understood\r\n       this was sent down by Mr. Ruef to stiffen them up and to find\r\n       out if that was so. It was not read at the notary's office\r\n       while I was there. I did not read it before signing it.\" See\r\n       Transcript on Appeal The People vs. Glass, page 278.\r\n\r\n       Supervisor Boxton testified: \"I signed the affidavit just\r\n       shown me at the request of the clerk of the Board of\r\n       Supervisors, Mr. George Keane. I do not know who prepared the\r\n       affidavit. No one had talked with me as to the facts that were\r\n       to be put in it. I knew nothing about its contents at all. It\r\n       was supposed generally amongst the members there was some talk\r\n       about it, that there was some of the members there that were a\r\n       bit weak-kneed, and would probably tell all they knew, so this\r\n       affidavit was framed up, as I understand it, to tie them down\r\n       a little tighter.\" See Transcript on Appeal, The People vs.\r\n       Glass, page 251.\r\n\r\n       Practically the same testimony was given by other Supervisors\r\n       at the various graft trials.\r\n\r\n [114] See footnote 95, page 87.\r\n\r\n [115] The passage between Heney and Ruef's lawyers which followed\r\n       Judge Seawell's ruling is thus set forth in the San Francisco\r\n       Chronicle of November 3rd:\r\n\r\n       \"'You can ask Mr. Ruef if he is guilty of any crimes or\r\n       felonies,' Ach suggested to Heney.\r\n\r\n       \"'I suppose he'll plead guilty here?' responded Heney\r\n       skeptically.\r\n\r\n       \"Samuel M. Shortridge, of Ruef's legal staff, took this\r\n       remark to heart and hotly said to Heney, 'You'll plead guilty\r\n       before he does.' The Judge informed Shortridge that Heney\r\n       obviously spoke in jest, but Shortridge thought it a poor\r\n       joke. Ruef considered Heney's whole proceeding a joke.\"\r\n\r\n [116] Judge Seawell in his decision said:\r\n\r\n       \"I am clearly of the opinion that the Charter, in so far as it\r\n       relates to removal and suspension, does not apply to the\r\n       District Attorney. I am firmly convinced that neither the\r\n       Mayor nor the Board of Supervisors has any power to remove or\r\n       suspend him. The District Attorney should not be left to the\r\n       investigation of the municipal authorities. I can conceive how\r\n       he might be compelled to proceed against the very persons who\r\n       might be conducting an inquiry. I will grant the injunction as\r\n       prayed for against Mr. Ruef.\"\r\n\r\n [117] A movement to secure Heney's dismissal from the District\r\n       Attorney's office, on the ground that he had accepted a fee in\r\n       addition to his salary as Assistant District Attorney, to act\r\n       as prosecutor was started. But the allegation was not\r\n       sustained and another failure was scored by the defense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                     RUEF AND SCHMITZ INDICTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin twenty-four hours after organizing, the Grand Jury had begun\r\ninvestigation into graft charges. Tenderloin extortion, especially in\r\nconnection with the so-called \"French Restaurants,\" was the first matter\r\ntaken up. The inquiry involved both Schmitz and Ruef.\r\n\r\nThe term \"French Restaurant\" in San Francisco is used in connection with\r\na particular type of assignation house. These establishments contain a\r\nrestaurant on the ground floor, and sometimes banquet hall and private\r\nrooms without assignation accompaniments. The stories overhead are\r\ndevoted to private supper bedrooms. Some of these assignation places are\r\nseveral stories in height. Before the fire, among the establishments\r\nalleged to be \"French Restaurants\" were Marchand's, Delmonico's, the New\r\nPoodle Dog, the Bay State and the Pup. The extent of the business\r\nconducted by these places is indicated by the testimony of A. B. Blanco,\r\nwho stated under oath at the graft trials that he had $200,000 invested\r\nin the New Poodle Dog, while Joe Malfanti testified that he had about\r\n$400,000 invested in Delmonico's.[118]\r\n\r\nFrench Restaurants had long been a scandal in San Francisco. Toward the\r\nclose of 1904, the Police Commission, then absolutely under domination\r\nof Schmitz and Ruef, gave evidence of proceeding against such places.\r\nThe commission, as a beginning, revoked the liquor license of a \"French\r\nRestaurant\" known as Tortoni's. Without a license to sell liquor a\r\n\"French Restaurant\" could not continue in business. These licenses had\r\nto be renewed once every three months. The Police Commission had\r\narbitrary power to grant, or to refuse, application for renewal. One by\r\none renewal applications of other French Restaurants were held up. It\r\nbecame a matter of common report that all the \"French Restaurants\" were\r\nto be treated as Tortoni's had been, namely, driven out of business by\r\nhaving their licenses to sell liquors revoked.\r\n\r\nAnd then Abe Ruef appeared before the Police Commissioners as attorney\r\nfor the \"French Restaurant\" keepers.[119] Ruef asked that consideration\r\nof the French Restaurant cases be postponed for two weeks. This was\r\naccorded him. But his request that during those two weeks the places be\r\npermitted to conduct their business as before, namely, that they be\r\nallowed to sell liquors in the private supper bedrooms, was denied by a\r\ntie vote, two commissioners of the four voting for Ruef and two against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBefore the two weeks' extension of time which Ruef had secured had\r\nexpired, Mayor Schmitz had removed from office one of the commissioners\r\nwho had opposed[120] Ruef's request that the sale of liquors in \"French\r\nRestaurant\" bedrooms be continued.\r\n\r\nThe opposing commissioner out of the way, the board by a vote of two to\r\none, adopted certain rules submitted by Ruef for the management of\r\nFrench Restaurants.[121] By the same vote, the commission then granted\r\nthe French-Restaurant licenses, action upon which had so long been\r\ndelayed.\r\n\r\nAll this was done before the public. There were, of course, charges of\r\ngraft and extortion, which most people, although without definite proof,\r\nbelieved. Heney, nearly a year later, in his speech in the Partridge\r\ncampaign, referred to in a previous chapter, charged graft. A Grand Jury\r\nhad made[122] an honest attempt to get to the bottom of the scandal. The\r\nefforts of this early Grand Jury came to nothing.\r\n\r\nThe Oliver Grand Jury had not been in session a fortnight, however,\r\nbefore the whole miserable story of Ruef's connection with the French\r\nRestaurant cases had been spread before it.\r\n\r\nThomas Regan, who had served as Police Commissioner during the Schmitz\r\nadministration, testified that as early as the summer of 1904 Schmitz\r\nhad told him that the \"French Restaurants\" were bad places and should\r\nnot be permitted to exist. When Tortoni's was closed, Schmitz stated to\r\nRegan, according to Regan's testimony, that the French Restaurants were\r\nall run alike, and should all be closed. Acting upon the Mayor's\r\nsuggestion, the Police Commission ordered the investigation into the\r\nmethods of the French Restaurants which created such a sensation in San\r\nFrancisco during the closing months of 1904. Licenses were denied in\r\nsome cases. In others, hearings of applications for renewals were\r\npostponed from time to time. Some proprietors were called upon to show\r\ncause why their licenses should not be revoked. Of all of which,\r\nCommissioner Regan testified, he kept Mayor Schmitz informed.\r\n\r\nThe course of the commission threw the keepers of the French Restaurants\r\ninto a panic. Their attorneys found themselves helpless and could give\r\ntheir clients no encouragement. Marcus Rosenthal, for example, who\r\nappeared before the commission on January 3, 1905, on behalf of the Bay\r\nState Restaurant, testified at the Schmitz trial, that he was not\r\npermitted to say anything; that the commissioners would not listen to\r\nhim, nor hear testimony. After that meeting he had advised his client,\r\nand a little group of \"French Restaurant\" keepers who had gathered\r\nabout him, that it would be useless for them to appeal to any court,\r\nbecause under the law there could be no review of the action of the\r\nPolice Commissioners; that the commission could arbitrarily dispose of\r\nany saloon-keeper, and he could not seek remedy in the courts.\r\n\r\nAnd then, having explained the situation fully, Rosenthal told them,\r\nwhat every observer in San Francisco knew, \"There is only one man who\r\ncould help you, and that is Mr. Ruef.\"[123] The French Restaurant\r\nkeepers received this advice from all sides. Joe Malfanti testified at\r\nthe Schmitz trial that \"numerous friends advised me to see Ruef.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to Mr. Ruef the \"French Restaurant\" keepers finally found themselves\r\ncompelled to go--at the urgent suggestion of a fellow French Restaurant\r\nkeeper, Jean Loupy.\r\n\r\nLoupy was proprietor of the French Restaurant known as the \"Pup.\" At\r\nLoupy's place Ruef maintained a sort of headquarters. There he took his\r\ndinner practically every night, entertained friends and received his\r\nhenchmen.\r\n\r\nRuef had from time to time acted as Loupy's attorney. He had also loaned\r\nLoupy money. At the time of the French Restaurant troubles, Loupy,\r\naccording to his testimony, owed Ruef $1000.\r\n\r\nWhen the closing of the French Restaurants seemed inevitable, this Loupy\r\nbrought word to the French Restaurant proprietors that Ruef would\r\nrepresent them all before the Police Commission for $7000 a year,[124]\r\non a contract for two years. The sum was finally cut to $5000,[125]\r\n$10,000 for the two years. For the first year \"Marchand's,\"\r\n\"Delmonico's,\" \"The New Poodle Dog\" and the \"Bay State\" paid $1175 each.\r\nLoupy for the \"Pup,\" on the grounds that he had been put to considerable\r\nexpense and was a poorer man than the others, paid only $300.[126]\r\n\r\nThe money being paid over to Ruef,[127] Ruef appeared before the Police\r\nCommissioners, as has already been told, with his plan for regulating\r\nthe French Restaurant business in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nRuef's arrangements with the French Restaurant keepers were concluded\r\nduring the first week in January. Police Commissioner Regan testified\r\nthat sometime after January 3, Mayor Schmitz asked him to vote to\r\nrestore the French Restaurant licenses.[128] Regan objected on the\r\nground that it was not right to ask him to vote first one way and then\r\nanother. With Commissioners Regan and Hutton voting against issuing the\r\nlicenses, the licenses could not be granted. Either Hutton or Regan had\r\nto change their attitude, or one of them had to be removed from office.\r\nPolice Commissioner F. F. Poheim testified at the Schmitz trial that at\r\na conference on the French Restaurant problem held early in January,\r\n1905, which he and Schmitz attended, Schmitz announced: \"We will have to\r\ngive these people (the French Restaurant proprietors) their licenses if\r\nwe can. If we cannot do anything else we will have to remove Hutton.\"\r\n\r\nAnd during the week following Ruef's first appearance before the\r\ncommissioners as representative of the French Restaurants, Mayor Schmitz\r\nremoved Hutton.[129] The licenses were then issued to the \"French\r\nRestaurant\" keepers.[130]\r\n\r\nMuch of the story of these transactions was presented to the Grand Jury.\r\nBut the evidence was not secured without effort. Many of the witnesses\r\nwere unfriendly; others afraid of the consequences of frank statement of\r\nfacts. Witnesses disappeared and could not be found. Several known to\r\nhave testified were threatened and even assaulted. One French Restaurant\r\nkeeper, before the investigation had been concluded, had been indicted\r\nfor perjury. Three attorneys who were more or less in touch with the\r\ntenderloin situation had been cited for contempt for refusing to answer\r\nquestions put to them in the Grand Jury room. But point by point the\r\nevidence was presented.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Jury, on the evidence, indicted Schmitz and Ruef on five\r\ncounts for extortion.[131] Bonds were fixed at $10,000 on each charge,\r\n$50,000 for each defendant.\r\n\r\nRuef[132] was released on $50,000 bail.\r\n\r\nSchmitz, the day after the indictments were brought, was reported to\r\nhave started for home from Europe.\r\n\r\nSchmitz's probable reception on his arrival at New York apparently gave\r\nkeen anxiety at San Francisco.\r\n\r\nHeney states that Justice F. W. Henshaw called at his (Heney's) office\r\nand asked Heney, as a favor, to tell him whether Schmitz would be\r\narrested upon his arrival in New York, as William J. Dingee of the\r\nContra Costa Water Company, wanted to arrange for Schmitz's bail in New\r\nYork City. William F. Herrin of the Southern Pacific Company is credited\r\nwith interesting himself in Schmitz's behalf in arranging for the bond\r\nthat was furnished when Schmitz reached San Francisco. Schmitz's bond\r\nwas furnished by Dingee and Thomas Williams, president of the New\r\nCalifornia Jockey Club. The New California Jockey Club operated the\r\nnotorious Emeryville racing and gambling establishment. Mr. Dingee was\r\nat the time one of California's most prominent capitalists.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [118] See Transcript on Appeal The People of the State of California\r\n       vs. Eugene E. Schmitz, pp. 500 and 557.\r\n\r\n [119] Ruef stated that he appeared as attorney for the French\r\n       Restaurant Keepers' Association. But those who paid him the\r\n       money for his efforts in this instance testified at the trial\r\n       of The People vs. Eugene E. Schmitz that they held membership\r\n       in no such organization, nor had they heard of it. In May,\r\n       1907, Ruef stated to Heney that he had closed the bargain with\r\n       the French-restaurant keepers to represent them on JANUARY 6,\r\n       1905. He insisted that he had at first flatly refused to\r\n       represent them; that he had had no intention whatever of so\r\n       doing until the San Francisco Bulletin denounced him for\r\n       having had the licenses held up and challenged him to take the\r\n       cases and to attempt to defend himself upon the theory that\r\n       the money so obtained by him was received as an attorney's\r\n       fee.\r\n\r\n       Heney examined the Bulletin files and found that the first\r\n       time the Bulletin had mentioned the French-restaurant hold-up\r\n       as an attempt on the part of Ruef to extort money from the\r\n       restaurant proprietors was in the last edition of The Bulletin\r\n       for JANUARY 7. 1905. (See Heney's affidavit in the case of The\r\n       People vs. Patrick Calhoun, et als., No. 823, pp. 141 to 143,\r\n       inclusive.)\r\n\r\n [120] Commissioner Harry W. Hutton.\r\n\r\n [121] These Ruef-provided rules directed that no liquors be served\r\n       in supper bedrooms on the first and second floors of the\r\n       establishments, and required the French restaurants to take\r\n       out hotel licenses and to keep registers the same as hotels.\r\n       What the keepers of the places thought of the regulations came\r\n       out at the Schmitz trial. Joe Malfanti of Delmonico's, for\r\n       example, testified: \"They (the Ruef rules) made no change in\r\n       the running of my business--not a single change. I had a hotel\r\n       license for years before and I always had a register, so there\r\n       was no change in my place whatever.\"\r\n\r\n [122] The Andrews Grand Jury, named from its foreman, T. P. Andrews.\r\n       The work of the Andrews Grand Jury was not lost, however. It\r\n       served as basis for much of the investigation conducted by the\r\n       Oliver Grand Jury.\r\n\r\n [123] Rosenthal testified at the Schmitz trial: \"I told them from my\r\n       observations and how things were going in the city and had\r\n       been going for some years, that there was only one man who\r\n       could help them--it was a question of life and death with\r\n       them--and I said there is only one man who could help you, and\r\n       that is Mr. Ruef.\"\r\n\r\n       Rosenthal, when examined on this point before the Grand Jury,\r\n       refused to testify on the ground that conversation between\r\n       attorney and client was privileged. Adler got into trouble\r\n       with the Grand Jury over his testimony on this point. Both\r\n       Rosenthal and Adler, however, testified at Schmitz's trial.\r\n\r\n [124] N. M. Adler, proprietor of the Bay State Restaurant, testified\r\n       at the Schmitz trial as to Loupy's negotiations. Loupy called\r\n       upon him twice. \"The first time he came,\" Adler testified, \"he\r\n       told me that things were very serious, and we would have to\r\n       put up some money and hire Mr. Ruef; that he was the only man\r\n       that could help us. I told him that I could not understand the\r\n       proposition; that I had run my business for twenty years, and\r\n       didn't think that they could do me any harm. At that time Ruef\r\n       was making his headquarters at the Pup restaurant. I could see\r\n       that from my place across the street. He went there\r\n       regularly.\"\r\n\r\n       Then Adler testified to the meeting before the Police\r\n       Commissioners at which his attorney, Rosenthal, had not been\r\n       permitted to speak, and continued: \"Afterwards, Loupy came to\r\n       me again, and told me that Tortoni had closed up, and that we\r\n       should put up the money or we would be all closed. This was\r\n       after we had been to the meeting of the Police Commissioners.\"\r\n\r\n [125] The testimony brought out at the graft trials showed that Ruef\r\n       received $8500 from the French restaurants, $5000 the first\r\n       year from the five in the combine; $3000 the second, and $500\r\n       additional from Camille Mailhebeau. Ruef stated to Heney later\r\n       and so testified at the Schmitz trial, that half of the $8000\r\n       received from the combine he turned over to Schmitz.\r\n\r\n [126] The five restaurant keepers were asked at the Schmitz trial\r\n       whether they had employed Ruef because he was a lawyer or\r\n       because of his recognized power as political boss. They\r\n       testified as follows:\r\n\r\n       A. B. Blanco of the \"New Poodle Dog\"--\"Well, being a political\r\n       boss we thought he had influence enough to get our licenses.\"\r\n\r\n       N. M. Adler, of the \"Bay State\"--\"Well, the way I took it, Mr.\r\n       Ruef is a boss. He had an influence over the commission. He\r\n       was the only man who could help us.\" On cross-examination: \"I\r\n       understood that if I did not employ Ruef I would not get my\r\n       license. I understood that Mr. Ruef was the only man who could\r\n       get my license.\"\r\n\r\n       Michel Debret of \"Marchand's\"--\"Well, I agreed to (pay the\r\n       money to Ruef) because having consulted we saw we had no way\r\n       to get out of it unless we paid Ruef, as he was a political\r\n       boss, to protect ourselves.\" \"Because we thought--we thought\r\n       if we didn't pay the money we would be treated like Tortoni's,\r\n       we would be closed; we had no way to get out of it.\" \"I\r\n       believed that Ruef and the Mayor controlled the Police\r\n       Commissioners.\"\r\n\r\n       Joe Malfanti of \"Delmonico's\"--\"I did not pay this $1175 for\r\n       fun; I had to save my license. I had about $400,000 invested\r\n       there. I never figured on what effect it would have upon my\r\n       business if I did not get a license. If it was for myself\r\n       alone I would close the place, but I figured on my partners,\r\n       what they had paid. They had a lease for five years and could\r\n       not go through with it and I did it as a favor. If I was alone\r\n       I would close. I would not make any fight. Numerous friends\r\n       advised me to see Ruef.\" \"I went to Ruef--Ruef was the man\r\n       that controlled the administration--Ruef was the one that\r\n       could do the thing. His relation with the Mayor was so he\r\n       could do what he pleased.\"\r\n\r\n       Jean Loupy was asked by Heney: \"Did you go to him (Ruef)\r\n       because he was a lawyer or because he was a political boss?\"\r\n       \"Because he was a political boss,\" replied Loupy.\r\n\r\n [127] Ruef would not take a check, neither would he accept gold--he\r\n       insisted upon having currency--neither would he give a\r\n       receipt. The money was taken to him by Pierre Priet, a\r\n       French-restaurant keeper. Regarding the transfer of the money,\r\n       Joe Malfanti, at the Schmitz trial, gave the following\r\n       testimony:\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Heney--Q. What did he say you were to get for the five\r\n       thousand dollars, Priet? A. Yes.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Yes, what did Priet say you were to get for your money? A.\r\n       We were going to get the license.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. For two years? A. No, we were going to have no trouble for\r\n       two years about a license.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Five thousand dollars a year? A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Now, then, what was said about how the money was to be\r\n       paid? What did Priet say about how the money was to be paid?\r\n       A. In currency.\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Campbell--That is under the same objection and exception.\r\n\r\n       \"The Witness--And that two people, not three, only two people,\r\n       not three.\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Heney--Q. What do you mean, that no one was to go with\r\n       him to Ruef? A. Yes.\r\n\r\n       \"The Witness--Priet said the money should be brought there in\r\n       currency and paid with two people.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Did Priet get you a receipt? A. I don't think he ever\r\n       looked for any. I asked him about that when he came back. He\r\n       said: 'Well, you should be glad to get his word of honor.'\r\n       That is what I got from Priet.\"\r\n\r\n [128] Regan testified at the Schmitz trial:\r\n\r\n       \"The Mayor asked me to vote for the French liquor licenses.\r\n       The first time he did so he put it on political grounds. He\r\n       requested me to vote for them, saying it would hurt him\r\n       politically if the license was not granted; and that they had\r\n       so many friends and so many rich people frequented those\r\n       places that it would be a very unpopular thing to take the\r\n       licenses away, and he requested me to vote for them. That it\r\n       would be unpopular to take them, the licenses, away, as they,\r\n       the restaurants, had so many friends and so many rich people\r\n       frequented the places. I said I didn't think it was right,\r\n       that he knew he got me to close those places up. That I could\r\n       not vote for them, as they were immoral and should be closed.\r\n       The second conversation was all of the same tenor.\"\r\n\r\n [129] Commissioner Poheim took papers from Ruef's office to the\r\n       Mayor on the day of Hutton's removal. Poheim testified at the\r\n       Schmitz trial:\r\n\r\n       \"I took papers from Mr. Ruef's office that I believe were the\r\n       papers of removal. He told me that they were. That was the day\r\n       of Hutton's removal.\"\r\n\r\n [130] The Chronicle in its issue of February 1, 1907, thus\r\n       summarized the evidence against Schmitz and Ruef, and the\r\n       nature of their defense:\r\n\r\n       \"Those operations are these: There are in this as in all other\r\n       cities certain dens of vice, ranging from the very fashionable\r\n       down to those patronized by the dregs of society, which can\r\n       exist only when licensed to sell liquor. To give or withhold\r\n       the license is within the discretion of the Police\r\n       Commissioners, and from their action there is no effectual\r\n       appeal. Since Ruef got control of the majority of these\r\n       commissioners they have been mere puppets, giving or\r\n       withholding the licenses of these places as directed by\r\n       Schmitz. That being the case, when renewals of licenses were\r\n       necessary, the applicants were refused. That meant the ruin of\r\n       their business. In the end, either from their general\r\n       knowledge, or because as advised, they applied to Ruef. When\r\n       the fee was settled and paid--in the case of the French\r\n       restaurants $5,000 a year--Ruef notified Schmitz, who, as the\r\n       prosecution is evidently prepared to prove, then directed the\r\n       licenses to issue, and they were issued. In the aggregate,\r\n       enormous sums were annually collected from these places by\r\n       Ruef or his agents, and without that payment they could not\r\n       have continued business. The revenues thus obtained were\r\n       evidently the sources of Schmitz's suddenly acquired wealth.\r\n       Presumably some small share was paid to the subordinates.\r\n\r\n       \"Certainly that is extortion, and extortion of the most\r\n       villainous kind. To the ordinary reader it is completely\r\n       covered by the language of the statute. The contention of Ruef\r\n       and Schmitz is not that they did not get the money, or that it\r\n       was not a villainous thing, but merely that it was not a\r\n       villainy expressly forbidden by statute, and that therefore to\r\n       indict them for it is 'persecution.' If there are any people\r\n       in the city who uphold or condone such things they are no\r\n       better than Ruef or Schmitz themselves.\"\r\n\r\n [131] The press throughout the State was a unit in approving the\r\n       Grand Jury's action. The San Francisco Chronicle fairly\r\n       expressed the general sentiment. It said:\r\n\r\n       \"Every decent man in San Francisco breathes freer to-day. The\r\n       fact cannot be concealed that there was an uneasy feeling in\r\n       the community that the machinations of the boss would again\r\n       secure immunity for himself and those who were with him in the\r\n       grafting business. The facility with which he turned the Grand\r\n       Jury preceding the present one into an instrument to\r\n       accomplish his own purposes inspired the fear that by hook or\r\n       crook he may have obtained control of the one now sitting; but\r\n       the promptitude with which the first indictment was brought\r\n       allays all apprehension and converts it into confidence that\r\n       the body now in session is in deadly earnest and that it will\r\n       earn the gratitude of its fellow citizens and cover itself\r\n       with glory by striking an effective blow which will put an end\r\n       to flagrant venality in office and restore the good name of\r\n       San Francisco.\"\r\n\r\n       The San Francisco Examiner said of the indictment of Schmitz\r\n       and Ruef: \"The light breaks, the reign of political terror\r\n       seems at an end. Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz and Abe Ruef, his\r\n       mentor and master, have been indicted for extortion. The move\r\n       of political regeneration and civic reform that has been\r\n       sweeping the country has hit San Francisco with the force of\r\n       all the other successes behind it. In other cities and other\r\n       States the powerful rascals as well as their satellites have\r\n       been sent to prison. Evidently San Francisco and California\r\n       are to rid themselves of the arch political criminals....\r\n       Thursday, November 15, 1906 (the day on which Ruef and Schmitz\r\n       were indicted), is a day to be remembered. It marks the\r\n       beginning of San Francisco's regeneration. It is a day of\r\n       heroic events to be told to children and grandchildren. It is\r\n       the day of the declaration of independence of California's\r\n       great metropolis.\"\r\n\r\n [132] Ruef denounced his indictment as absurd, insisting that he had\r\n       merely taken fees for services rendered. In an interview\r\n       published in the San Francisco Chronicle of November 16, 1906,\r\n       he said:\r\n\r\n       \"The whole thing is absurd. I was simply acting in the\r\n       relation of attorney to a client. I took my fee for rendering\r\n       legal services. I was retained by a contract as attorney by\r\n       the restaurant keepers. If it is extortion for an attorney to\r\n       accept a fee from his client, we all might as well go out of\r\n       business. This is exactly the same charge that was made\r\n       against me once before and was found baseless. I have nothing\r\n       to fear.\"\r\n\r\n       On November 17 the Chronicle, touching upon Ruef's defense,\r\n       said: \"Every branch of the city government which is controlled\r\n       by Ruef men is known to be utterly rotten. The only question\r\n       has been whether under the advice and direction of low legal\r\n       cunning, the grafters have kept themselves immune from the\r\n       law. And the question is about to be settled.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n                      FIGHT TO EVADE TRIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe indictments against Schmitz and Ruef were returned November 15.\r\nSchmitz reached San Francisco on his return from Europe on November\r\n29.[133] He at once joined with Ruef in the fight to prevent the issue\r\nraised by his indictment being presented to a trial jury.\r\n\r\nThe two defendants were to have been arraigned on December 3, but at\r\ntheir earnest solicitation arraignment[134] was continued until December\r\n6.\r\n\r\nOn that day the plans of the defendants became apparent. It was seen\r\nthat they would divide the defense, demanding separate trials; and it\r\nwas quite as evident that their first move would be an attack upon the\r\nvalidity of the Grand Jury.\r\n\r\nAttorneys Frank C. Drew and John J. Barrett appeared for Schmitz, while\r\nRuef was represented by Samuel M. Shortridge and Henry Ach. At the close\r\nof the proceedings, Ach asked that subpoenas be issued for the members\r\nof the Grand Jury to appear in court the following Monday to testify for\r\nthe defendants. This meant the examination of the Grand Jurors for\r\nbias. The long technical fight to disqualify the Grand Jury had\r\nopened.[135]\r\n\r\nIn the attack upon the Grand Jury, Joseph C. Campbell joined with\r\nSchmitz's attorneys, Drew and Barrett, while Frank J. Murphy and Charles\r\nH. Fairall appeared with Shortridge and Ach for Ruef. Ach, in moving to\r\nset aside or quash the indictments, stated that the motion was made for\r\nSchmitz and Ruef jointly, but that the defendants reserved the right to\r\nplead and to be tried separately.\r\n\r\nAch's motion was based on nineteen counts. The point most insisted upon\r\nwas that Grand Juror Wallace Wise was disqualified because of his having\r\nbeen on a petty trial jury panel during the current year. Wise, being\r\nthus disqualified, Ach argued, the whole indictment failed as much as\r\nthough the whole nineteen Grand Jurors were disqualified.[136]\r\n\r\nJudge Dunne, after a three days' hearing, swept aside the multitude of\r\ntechnical objections which the various attorneys for the defense had\r\nadvanced. In particular did he refuse to declare the whole nineteen\r\nGrand Jurors disqualified, because of the alleged disqualification of\r\nJuror Wise.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution had gained another point in its fight to bring the\r\ndefendants to trial on the merits of their cases.\r\n\r\nBut the attack upon the Grand Jury had scarcely begun. After Judge\r\nDunne's ruling, the nineteen Grand Jurors were to be put on the stand\r\nand examined one by one for bias.[137] The defense went further, and\r\nhad Rudolph Spreckels up to question him as to his motives in\r\nguaranteeing a fund for the investigation of graft conditions.[138]\r\nDistrict Attorney Langdon was also placed on the stand to be examined as\r\nto his motive in appointing Heney his assistant. He denied most\r\nemphatically that he had appointed Heney for the sole purpose of\r\ninstituting criminal proceedings against Ruef and Schmitz.\r\n\r\nThe examination of Grand Jurors, prosecutors and citizens lasted from\r\nDecember 17 until January 22. On the last named date, Judge Dunne denied\r\nthe motion to set aside the indictments for bias. The prosecution had\r\ngained another step toward bringing the defendants to trial.\r\n\r\nJudge Dunne stated that he was ready to set the cases for trial the next\r\nday. But the defendants had another delaying play. They demurred to the\r\nindictments. The demurrers were not disposed of until February 18.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the defense had made several complicating moves. The\r\nfirst of these was an application to Judge Graham to have the case\r\nagainst Schmitz transferred from Judge Dunne's court. At the same time\r\nSchmitz surrendered himself to the Sheriff, and applied to the Supreme\r\nCourt for a writ of habeas corpus, and a writ of prohibition, setting up\r\nthe points already raised in Judge Dunne's court against the\r\nindictments. The Supreme Court finally decided against Schmitz.\r\n\r\nBut there remained another way of having the case transferred from Judge\r\nDunne's court. The law governing changes of venue could be changed by\r\nthe Legislature. The 1907 Legislature had convened early in January. A\r\nmeasure was introduced in both Senate and Assembly under the terms of\r\nwhich a defendant in a criminal action was permitted to secure a\r\ntransfer of his case from one court to another by merely filing\r\naffidavit of his belief that he could not get fair trial in the court in\r\nwhich his case was pending.[139] The measure was known as the \"Change\r\nof Venue Bill.\" Its chief supporter in the Legislature was George B.\r\nKeane.\r\n\r\nKeane was not only clerk of the Board of Supervisors, but he was a\r\nmember of the State Senate representing a San Francisco district. Keane\r\nchampioned the \"Change of Venue Bill.\"[140] The measure passed the\r\nAssembly, but failed of passage in the Senate. Ruef in his efforts to\r\nescape trial before Judge Dunne had lost again.\r\n\r\nEarly in February, when the efforts of Schmitz and Ruef to evade trial\r\nwere being pressed the hardest, agitation against the Japanese gave\r\nSchmitz opportunity not only to absent himself from the State, thus\r\nbringing the proceedings so far as they applied to him, to a standstill,\r\nbut to restore his prestige. Schmitz was quick to avail himself of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe question of admitting Japanese to California schools was then under\r\nconsideration at Washington. A request was extended the San Francisco\r\nBoard of Education, through California Congressmen, that the members of\r\nthe board go to Washington for conference with the government\r\nauthorities. Members of the board held consultation with Schmitz, after\r\nwhich word was circulated about the State that in defense of the public\r\nschools against the Japanese, Schmitz must, on behalf of San Francisco\r\nand California, go to Washington.\r\n\r\nA telegram was received from Congressman Julius Kahn, a close supporter\r\nof Ruef and Schmitz, who represented a San Francisco district in\r\nCongress, stating that \"at the request of the President and Secretary of\r\nState we ask you to come here immediately for a conference with them and\r\nthe California delegation.\"\r\n\r\nSchmitz started for Washington on February 3.[141] He was absent from\r\nSan Francisco until March 6. He did not, however, as had been predicted,\r\nreturn amid popular acclaim. The outcome of the Washington negotiations\r\nwas not satisfactory to California. There was popular belief that the\r\nMayor's mission had failed. At the State line Schmitz received the\r\nstartling word that Ruef was a fugitive from justice; that Sheriff\r\nO'Neil had failed to discover the fugitive's whereabouts and had been\r\ndisqualified. During the month of his absence from San Francisco, the\r\nMayor was soon to learn, events of tremendous importance to himself and\r\nto his administration had occurred.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [133] On his arrival in New York after being indicted for extortion\r\n       in the French Restaurant cases, Mayor Schmitz in an interview\r\n       widely published at the time gave his attitude toward the\r\n       French Restaurants. The Mayor explained that these restaurants\r\n       had existed so long in the city that they had become a\r\n       recognized adjunct of a gay life of a gay town. He had not\r\n       favored their suppression, and whenever the Police\r\n       Commissioners agitated the revoking of their liquor licenses,\r\n       he had opposed them.\r\n\r\n       \"The French restaurants did no great harm,\" he is quoted as\r\n       saying, \"and to destroy them would be to ruin the men who had\r\n       invested money in them.\" The character of some of the heavy\r\n       investors in these establishments was brought out in the\r\n       report of the commission appointed by Mayor E. R. Taylor to\r\n       ascertain causes of municipal corruption in San Francisco, as\r\n       disclosed by the investigations of the Oliver Grand Jury. The\r\n       report set forth:\r\n\r\n       \"The business (of the French restaurants) is very prosperous,\r\n       and, as is usual, the landlord shares in its prosperity.\r\n       People of social prominence were known to accept a portion of\r\n       the profits of such establishments, through the extremely\r\n       liberal rentals paid, and the system is received with easy\r\n       toleration. One of the largest of these assignation places was\r\n       located on a prominent corner of the downtown shopping\r\n       district where hundreds of women daily passed its doors. The\r\n       building, five stories in height, had four stories devoted to\r\n       the private supper bedrooms. The land was owned in trust by\r\n       one of the largest, if not the largest, trust company in the\r\n       West. A lease was sought and obtained by a man notorious in\r\n       the line of business above described; the building was\r\n       constructed by the trust company according to plans\r\n       satisfactory to him for this purpose, and the enterprise was\r\n       conducted there for seven years until the building was\r\n       destroyed by fire. The significant thing about such a\r\n       transaction is, not that there are people who are willing to\r\n       accept money from such a source, or financiers willing to put\r\n       trust moneys to such uses, but that the facts, though well\r\n       known, did not seem to detract in the slightest from the\r\n       social recognition accorded to the persons so taking a share\r\n       of the profits, while the officer of the trust company which\r\n       made the lease of that particular house situated in the\r\n       shopping district, was appointed a regent of the State\r\n       University.\"\r\n\r\n [134] During the reading of the first of the five indictments,\r\n       Schmitz stood, but Ruef remained seated. When the second\r\n       indictment was read, both the defendants kept their seats.\r\n       Heney demanded to know what was going on. Judge Dunne\r\n       announced that the arraignment must proceed as in ordinary\r\n       cases. During the reading of the remaining indictments both\r\n       defendants remained standing, but Ruef kept his back turned\r\n       toward the court. Commenting upon this incident, the\r\n       Chronicle, in its issue of December 8, 1906, said in an\r\n       editorial article:\r\n\r\n       \"In Judge Dunne's court a rogue on trial insolently refused to\r\n       stand and be arraigned like any other criminal, apparently on\r\n       the assumption that a political boss was above the courts. He\r\n       was finally compelled to stand and let his shame be seen. He\r\n       sat, however, through one arraignment, and the people have\r\n       reason to complain that the trial Judge did not earlier\r\n       enforce the respect due to the majesty of the law. In another\r\n       instance there is a more grave offense. A lawyer presumed to\r\n       bandy words with the Judge on the bench, and is reported to\r\n       have said to the Court in a loud and insolent tone, evincing\r\n       evident disrespect, 'And I have heard considerable oratory\r\n       from you.' Nothing was done about it, and Judge Dunne owes it\r\n       to the people to explain why he did not promptly commit the\r\n       insolent fellow to jail. The Judge on the bench represents the\r\n       majesty of the law. He sits for the people in solemn judgment\r\n       on offenders. He is expected to enforce due respect for the\r\n       tribunal, and for that purpose is invested with the power of\r\n       summary punishment for contempt. Our alleged administration of\r\n       criminal justice is disgraceful, and the evil permeates the\r\n       entire machinery, from the policeman on his beat to the\r\n       highest tribunal.\"\r\n\r\n [135] The attack upon the Grand Jury had, however, been begun the\r\n       day before, and was progressing in another department of the\r\n       court even as Ruef and Schmitz were arraigned. Investigation\r\n       into graft conditions had by this time got beyond the\r\n       tenderloin. Several minor indictments had been brought.\r\n       Supervisor Fred P. Nicholas had been indicted for accepting a\r\n       bribe of $26.10. As chairman of the Public Building and\r\n       Grounds Committee, the Grand Jury found he had accepted a 10\r\n       per cent. commission on $261 worth of furniture purchased for\r\n       the city. Several witnesses had been indicted for perjury in\r\n       connection with the graft investigation. That the\r\n       investigation was going far was now conceded. The defense\r\n       concentrated to disqualify the Grand Jury. On behalf of\r\n       Nicholas and Duffy, the Grand Jurors were haled into Judge\r\n       William P. Lawlor's court December 5, the day before Schmitz\r\n       and Ruef were arraigned. The defendants were represented by\r\n       Frank J. Murphy, who was to play a prominent part in the graft\r\n       defense. The following taken from the examination of Foreman\r\n       B. P. Oliver, as printed in the San Francisco Chronicle of\r\n       December 7, is a fair sample of the nature of the inquiry:\r\n\r\n       \"Did you say to anyone that this is just the beginning of the\r\n       investigation of municipal corruption?\"\r\n\r\n       \"I have said that from the statements I have heard in the\r\n       Grand Jury room that the corruption of the municipal\r\n       administration was so great that the present Grand Jury could\r\n       hardly expect to make any impression upon it. As to when and\r\n       where I made that statement I cannot tell,\" replied Oliver,\r\n       who proceeded: \"As to myself, the mere testimony I have heard\r\n       in the Grand Jury room has filled me with horror and disgust.\"\r\n\r\n       \"Does it fill you with such horror that you believe everyone\r\n       connected with the administration is corrupt?\" asked Lawyer\r\n       Fairall of counsel for the defense. \"I do not believe anyone\r\n       to be corrupt until he is proved to be so.\"\r\n\r\n       \"Could you act fairly and impartially, as a Grand Juror, while\r\n       having your present feeling of horror and disgust?\" \"Yes,\r\n       absolutely so, for I have a conscience.\"\r\n\r\n       \"You feel that your conscience would enable you to act\r\n       fairly?\" \"I do. If I erred at all it would be on the other\r\n       side, so as to be sure that I did the accused no injustice.\"\r\n\r\n       This examination went on for several days. The same\r\n       examination of the Grand Jurors followed in the case of Ruef\r\n       and Schmitz, and was repeated for the third time on behalf of\r\n       public-service corporation agents who were indicted later.\r\n\r\n [136] The question of the eligibility of Grand Juror Wise was\r\n       finally decided by the State Supreme Court in the matter of\r\n       the application of A. Ruef for a writ of habeas corpus (150\r\n       California, p. 665.) The Court held that the presence on the\r\n       Grand Jury of a member who had served and been discharged as a\r\n       juror by a court of record within a year of the time that he\r\n       had been summoned and impaneled to act as a grand juror does\r\n       not affect the validity of an indictment found by the Grand\r\n       Jury.\r\n\r\n [137] The Chronicle, in its issue of December 18, 1906, said of the\r\n       attack upon the Grand Jury:\r\n\r\n       \"The fact that the felons whom we are trying to convict are\r\n       officials has nothing to do with their demonstration of the\r\n       fact that it is impossible, under the laws, to put thieves in\r\n       the penitentiary, when there is a large band rounded up at one\r\n       time and they all fight. Under our laws the half-dozen rascals\r\n       who have already been indicted for their share in the orgy of\r\n       official plunder in this city can block our criminal courts.\r\n       The disgraceful farce of putting the Grand Jurors and the\r\n       District Attorney on trial instead of the scoundrels who have\r\n       been indicted can apparently be protracted for weeks. Happily\r\n       the Legislature meets early next month, and if it does not put\r\n       a speedy end to it we are mistaken. We are getting an object\r\n       lesson which, perhaps, was needed. The whole miserable\r\n       machinery of obstruction must be swept away. Whoever is\r\n       indicted by a Grand Jury must go to trial, unless, in the\r\n       opinion of the trial Judge, extraordinary conditions indicate\r\n       that some inquiry should be made to be conducted solely by\r\n       himself. The public will be satisfied with nothing short of\r\n       that, nor will it be satisfied with that. The abuses of appeal\r\n       must be ended.\"\r\n\r\n [138] Mr. Spreckels testified in part as follows: \"I am not\r\n       interested in the downfall of any man, either Eugene E.\r\n       Schmitz or Abraham Ruef. I did guarantee the sum of $100,000\r\n       to detect any wrongdoing whatsoever in the city of San\r\n       Francisco. I indicated that to Mr. Heney. I cannot recollect\r\n       as to dates, but I think it was a short while before the\r\n       commencement of these proceedings. It was since the calamity\r\n       of April 18. I had been interested for a long while before\r\n       that in starting an investigation.... I did not guarantee to\r\n       Mr. Heney $100,000, but I did guarantee that for the purpose\r\n       of investigation for the collection of evidence, I would\r\n       personally guarantee $100,000 for the expenses.... My object\r\n       was merely to ascertain the truth or falsity of things that\r\n       had been generally stated. Some of the things I had known of\r\n       myself. I knew there was an effort made in the city here of\r\n       doing things in the past. Mr. Ruef, himself, had had a\r\n       conversation with me which indicated that he was in a position\r\n       to do certain things, and knowing these things I was willing\r\n       that an investigation should proceed to the bottom, and to\r\n       furnish the money necessary to collect the evidence. I have\r\n       stated publicly relative to this fund of $100,000.\"\r\n\r\n [139] The San Francisco Chronicle, in its issue of January 17, 1907,\r\n       said of the Change of Venue bill:\r\n\r\n       \"Assemblyman Grove L. Johnson of Sacramento, and Senator L. A.\r\n       Wright of San Diego, have introduced identical bills which\r\n       provide in brief, that in any criminal trial the accused may\r\n       displace the Judge upon his mere affidavit that he 'believes\r\n       he cannot have a fair and impartial trial.' Upon the filing of\r\n       such an affidavit the services of some other Judge must be\r\n       secured, provided that in counties having more than one\r\n       department of the Superior Court the case shall be transferred\r\n       to some other department of the same county. The bill provides\r\n       that the act shall take effect immediately upon its passage.\r\n       The obvious intent of the law is to enable the indicted\r\n       boodlers of this city to select the Judge who shall try them,\r\n       to set aside all that has thus far been done to get them\r\n       before a jury and have their cases retried from the\r\n       beginning.\"\r\n\r\n [140] Ruef had, as early as 1904, secured a hold on the State\r\n       Legislature, by putting up and electing a Union Labor party\r\n       legislative ticket. \"I told the legislators,\" said Ruef in a\r\n       statement published after he had entered San Quentin prison,\r\n       \"to vote on all labor questions and legislation directly\r\n       involving labor interests always for the labor side. I told\r\n       them on all other questions to follow the Herrin program.\r\n       Herrin was appreciative. He expressed his sense of\r\n       obligation.\"--Abraham Ruef's \"The Road I Traveled,\" published\r\n       in San Francisco Bulletin, July 6, 1912.\r\n\r\n       Keane, at the trial of The People vs. Ruef, No. 1437, admitted\r\n       that he had supported \"The Assembly bill providing for changes\r\n       of place of trial in certain cases,\" at the special request of\r\n       Ruef. See transcript on appeal, part 3, book 1, pages 442-3.\r\n       Keane was also active in the advocacy of other measures\r\n       changing the law governing criminal cases. One of these\r\n       practically forbade public comment on a criminal trial from\r\n       the impaneling of the Grand Jury until the rendering of the\r\n       verdict. Commenting upon this anti-publicity bill, E. H.\r\n       Hamilton, in a dispatch from Sacramento to the San Francisco\r\n       Examiner, published in that paper March 5, 1907, said: \"This\r\n       bill had been sneaked through the Senate the other night when\r\n       no one was paying any attention, but Senator Boynton moved to\r\n       reconsider the vote by which the bill was passed, and brought\r\n       up the matter to-day, asking that the bill be given a free\r\n       discussion before it was acted upon. He showed that it was\r\n       directly in opposition to the Constitution of the United\r\n       States and the Constitution of the State, because it was aimed\r\n       directly at the freedom of the press and intended to prevent\r\n       newspapers from publishing accounts of criminal trials.\r\n\r\n       \"Senator Sanford of Mendocino said that it was an attempt to\r\n       muzzle the press and to prevent people from ascertaining what\r\n       was going on in criminal lawsuits, but the Senate refused to\r\n       reconsider the vote by which it had passed the\r\n       unconstitutional bill.\"\r\n\r\n       Keane also pressed an amendment to the codes to prevent\r\n       stenographers and bookkeepers testifying against their\r\n       employers. During the discussion in the Senate Committee on\r\n       the Change of Venue bill, Keane offered an amendment to make\r\n       this measure take effect immediately.\r\n\r\n [141] On the way across San Francisco Bay to take the train at\r\n       Oakland, in the words of newspaper reports of the incident,\r\n       members of Mayor Schmitz's personal following who accompanied\r\n       him, \"were frankly delighted with the prospect of the indicted\r\n       Mayor returning from the national capital covered with glory,\r\n       and acclaimed the savior of the country from a war with\r\n       Japan.\"\r\n\r\n       Ruef regarded the incident cynically. \"As soon as Schmitz got\r\n       aboard that train,\" said Ruef on the day of the Mayor's\r\n       departure, \"the nation was saved.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                          RUEF A FUGITIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree months[142] after his indictment in the \"French Restaurant\"\r\nextortion cases--three months of continuous fighting to evade the\r\nissue--Ruef found his last technical obstruction, as far as the State\r\ncourts were concerned, swept away, and was forced to enter his plea to\r\nthe charge contained in the indictment. He pleaded \"not guilty.\" His\r\ntrial was set for March 5.\r\n\r\nUp to the day before the date fixed for the trial to begin, nothing had\r\ncome up to indicate further delay. On March 4, however, Ruef's bondsmen\r\nsurrendered him into the custody of the Sheriff. Ruef then applied to\r\nSuperior Judge J. C. B. Hebbard for a writ of habeas corpus. The\r\napplication was based on the allegation dealt with in a previous\r\nchapter, that Grand Juror Wise was ineligible, because he had been drawn\r\nas a trial juror within a year before the impanelment of the Grand Jury\r\nof which he was a member. On the ground that Wise was ineligible for\r\nGrand Jury service, Ruef's attorneys contended, their client's restraint\r\nwas in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth amendments to the Federal\r\nConstitution, thereby raising a Federal issue and paving the way for\r\nappeal to the Federal courts.\r\n\r\nIn opposing Ruef's new move, Hiram W. Johnson,[143] who had been\r\nemployed to assist the District Attorney in the \"graft\" prosecution,\r\npointed out that the cases named in the petition were pending in a\r\nco-ordinate branch of the Superior Court; that they were set for trial\r\nthe following day; that the points, including the Federal points, had\r\nbeen made subject of extensive arguments before Hebbard's colleague,\r\nJudge Dunne, and in the course of those arguments every question\r\npresented in the proceedings had been passed upon.\r\n\r\nAch, representing Ruef, denied that the Federal question had been\r\npresented. Johnson insisted that it had. An unfortunate scene\r\nfollowed.[144] Hebbard showed symptoms of intoxication. Johnson, Langdon\r\nand Heney finally refused to participate further in the proceedings and\r\nwalked out of the courtroom.[145] The withdrawal of the District\r\nAttorney and his assistants did not delay Judge Hebbard's decision. He\r\ndenied the writ Ruef prayed for, but he allowed an appeal from his order\r\nto the Supreme Court of the United States, and admitted Ruef to bail\r\npending that appeal.\r\n\r\nOne of Ruef's attorneys filed the writ of error issued by Judge Hebbard\r\nwith the clerk of the Federal Circuit Court. May 2 was set as the date\r\nfor the appearance on the writ of error before the United States Supreme\r\nCourt at Washington.[146]\r\n\r\nThe Aetna Indemnity Company had furnished Ruef's bond. This company\r\nsurrendered Ruef to the Sheriff in the forenoon. In the afternoon it\r\nfurnished the bail that had been imposed by Judge Hebbard.\r\n\r\nRuef, in Hebbard's order granting him opportunity to take his case to\r\nthe Federal Courts, had basis for further struggle in the courts to\r\nevade trial. But he undertook a new move. After leaving Hebbard's\r\ncourtroom on the afternoon of March 4, Ruef dropped out of sight as\r\ncompletely as though the earth had opened and swallowed him.\r\n\r\nFor three days the regular peace officers of San Francisco searched San\r\nFrancisco for him but they did not find him. When Ruef's case was\r\ncalled for trial in Judge Dunne's department on the morning following\r\nthe proceedings in Judge Hebbard's court, Ruef's attorney, Samuel M.\r\nShortridge, was present, but not the defendant.\r\n\r\nShortridge was in the position of an attorney in court without a\r\nclient.[147] After a wait of four hours, to give Ruef every opportunity\r\nto make his appearance, Heney moved that the bonds of the absent\r\ndefendant be declared forfeited, specifying the bonds originally given\r\nas well as those furnished in the proceedings before Hebbard.\r\n\r\nJudge Dunne, in ruling upon Heney's motion, stated that he was\r\nproceeding as though the proceedings before Judge Hebbard had not\r\noccurred. Those proceedings, he announced, he felt were under a species\r\nof fraud. He ordered Ruef's original bonds forfeited and took the\r\nquestion of the forfeiture of the bonds in the proceedings before Judge\r\nHebbard under advisement. He considered it his duty, he said, to proceed\r\nwith the trial of the case until ordered to desist by the Supreme Court\r\nor by the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\nAttorney Shortridge announced to Judge Dunne that in proceeding with the\r\nhearing he might find himself in contempt of the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States. Judge Dunne stated that that would not embarrass him, and\r\nin any event, he would not proceed with the matter until the defendant\r\nwas in court.\r\n\r\nThe day passed without the defendant's whereabouts being discovered.\r\nSheriff O'Neil reported that he had been unable to find the fugitive,\r\nbut expressed his belief that he would be able to do so eventually. With\r\nthat understanding court adjourned for the day.\r\n\r\nThe day following, Ruef's attorneys appealed to the State Appellate\r\nCourt[148] for a writ of prohibition to prevent Judge Dunne and others\r\nfrom further proceeding against Ruef in the extortion cases, and to show\r\ncause why the writ should not be made permanent. Ruef being in hiding,\r\nthe application was not signed by the petitioner. The Appellate Court,\r\nafter twenty-four hours, denied the petition. Ruef's representatives\r\nthen went before the State Supreme Court with the same representations.\r\nAnd here, again, eventually, Ruef lost.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Ruef had not been found. The day following his\r\ndisappearance, Judge Dunne disqualified the Sheriff and named the next\r\nofficer in authoritative sequence in such matters, the Coroner, W. J.\r\nWalsh, as elisor, to arrest Ruef and bring him into court.\r\n\r\nCoroner Walsh had no better success than had Sheriff O'Neil. Ruef had\r\ndisappeared on the night of Monday, March 4. On Friday, March 8, after\r\nthree days of unavailing search by O'Neil and Walsh,[149] Judge Dunne\r\ndisqualified Walsh and appointed William J. Biggy[150] as elisor to\r\narrest the fugitive.\r\n\r\nWithin two hours Biggy, accompanied by Detective William J. Burns, had\r\nlocated Ruef at a road-house in the San Francisco suburbs and had placed\r\nhim under arrest.[151]\r\n\r\nHaving taken his man,[152] the elisor was at a loss to know what to do\r\nwith him. To put him in the city prison was to turn him over to the\r\npolice; to put him in the county jail was to turn him over to the\r\nSheriff. The Chief of Police was even then under indictment with Ruef, a\r\nco-defendant; the Sheriff had been disqualified. The only alternative\r\nwas for Biggy himself to hold Ruef until the court could act. Biggy\r\naccordingly secured suitable quarters at the Hotel St. Francis, and\r\nthere held Ruef a prisoner until the following Monday, when he was taken\r\nbefore Judge Dunne.\r\n\r\nJudge Dunne refused to admit Ruef to bail, remanded him to Elisor\r\nBiggy's custody, and continued his trial until the following morning,\r\nTuesday, March 12.\r\n\r\nRuef immediately made application to the Supreme Court for a writ of\r\nhabeas corpus, asking to be released from the custody of Elisor Biggy\r\nand placed in charge of the Sheriff. But here again Ruef was defeated.\r\nElisor Biggy continued his keeper for many months following.\r\n\r\nRuef, after his appeal to the Federal Supreme Court, had exhausted every\r\nlegal device known to himself and his attorneys to escape trial in the\r\nextortion case pending before Judge Dunne.[153] His last recourse gone,\r\nRuef found himself brought face to face with trial before a jury. On\r\nMarch 13 the selecting of jurors to try Ruef began in Judge Dunne's\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nBut events of far greater moment than petty extortion had the attention\r\nof San Francisco. Even as Ruef was in hiding, Detective Burns and his\r\nassistants had trapped three members of the Board of Supervisors in\r\nbribery. This opened up the most fruitful field of the graft\r\nprosecution, and immediately the extortion cases became of comparative\r\nunimportance. The trapping of the three Supervisors led to confessions\r\nfrom fourteen others, which involved not only Ruef in enormous bribery\r\ntransactions, but also prominent members of the bar, and leaders in the\r\nsocial, financial and industrial life of California.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [142] Ruef and Schmitz were indicted November 15, 1906. The date of\r\n       Ruef's plea of \"Not guilty\" was February 18, 1907.\r\n\r\n [143] Hiram W. Johnson is a native of California, having been born\r\n       at Sacramento. He was educated at the Sacramento public\r\n       schools and the University of California. At twenty-one he had\r\n       been admitted to practice at the California bar. He was active\r\n       for years against the corrupt political conditions in\r\n       California before he came into prominence as one of the\r\n       prosecutors at the graft trials. In 1910 he was selected to\r\n       lead the movement against the political machine which\r\n       dominated the State. As primary candidate for Republican\r\n       nomination for Governor, he visited practically every\r\n       community in California, making one pledge to be carried out\r\n       in the event of his election, \"to kick the Southern Pacific\r\n       out of political control of the State.\" He was nominated and\r\n       elected. His election resulted in political revolution in\r\n       California. (See \"Story of the California Legislature of 1911\"\r\n       and \"Story of the California Legislature of 1913.\") He was one\r\n       of the founders of the Progressive party at Chicago in 1912,\r\n       and was that year candidate for Vice-President with Roosevelt\r\n       on the National Progressive ticket. In 1914 he was re-elected\r\n       Governor of California with overwhelming vote. Johnson is the\r\n       first Governor since 1853 to secure re-election in California.\r\n\r\n [144] See Heney's affidavit in The People vs. Ruef, No. 823.\r\n\r\n [145] \"Again we protest,\" said Johnson when the final break came,\r\n       \"in behalf of the District Attorney of this city and county,\r\n       and in the name of the people of California. We do not believe\r\n       in this; we will not participate in it; and we take our leave\r\n       of this court. We will not participate in any proceeding which\r\n       does not, according to our ideas, comport with the dignity of\r\n       justice, the dignity of this court, or our own dignity.\"\r\n\r\n [146] On March 25, 1907, Ruef's appeal in the habeas corpus matter\r\n       was dismissed by the Supreme Court of the United States. Of\r\n       this move, Frank J. Murphy, one of Ruef's attorneys, is quoted\r\n       in a published interview: \"We have instructed our\r\n       representative in Washington to withdraw the writ of error\r\n       filed by us. This decision was reached on account of the\r\n       decision of the State Supreme Court to the effect that the\r\n       participation of an incompetent juror does not affect the\r\n       validity of an indictment.\"\r\n\r\n       This action left the Prosecution free to proceed with Ruef's\r\n       trial without any possibility of the proceedings being\r\n       questioned later.\r\n\r\n [147] Judge Dunne ruled that Ruef, being a fugitive from justice,\r\n       and his trial one for felony, at which the defendant must be\r\n       present at every stage of the proceedings, there was no trial\r\n       before the court. Shortridge was in the position of counsel\r\n       without a client. During the examination of Coroner Walsh,\r\n       after his failure to find Ruef, Shortridge insisted upon\r\n       interrupting the examination. Judge Dunne after repeated\r\n       warnings, found Shortridge guilty of contempt of court, and\r\n       sentenced him to serve twenty-four hours in jail. The\r\n       Chronicle of March 9, 1907, contains the following account of\r\n       the incident:\r\n\r\n       \"Have you not said,\" Walsh was asked by Heney, \"that you hoped\r\n       he (Ruef) would be acquitted and that you would do all you\r\n       could for him? Are you not in sympathy with him?\"\r\n\r\n       Again the Coroner quibbled and Judge Dunne ordered: \"Answer\r\n       the question. Do you sympathize with him or not?\"\r\n\r\n       Still the witness hesitated, and again the Judge asked with\r\n       vigor: \"Are you in sympathy with him?\"\r\n\r\n       \"If he is innocent I am in sympathy with him, if he is guilty\r\n       I am not.\"\r\n\r\n       \"I suppose you wish it to appear that you are not in sympathy\r\n       with him so that you may take charge of the jury,\" suggested\r\n       Heney.\r\n\r\n       Samuel M. Shortridge, one of Ruef's lawyers, here said that he\r\n       objected on behalf of his client to the line of examination.\r\n\r\n       Heney proceeded without paying any attention to Shortridge's\r\n       interruption. Shortridge again entered an objection, and Judge\r\n       Dunne ordered him to take his seat.\r\n\r\n       \"But I wish to be heard on behalf of my client,\" persisted\r\n       Shortridge.\r\n\r\n       \"Take your seat, Mr. Shortridge, or I will order the Sheriff\r\n       to cause you to do so or remove you from the court room,\"\r\n       declared Judge Dunne.\r\n\r\n       \"Am I to understand that I am not to be heard in this court?\"\r\n       demanded Shortridge with play of great indignation.\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Shortridge, your conduct is boisterous and offensive and\r\n       tends to interfere with the orderly conduct of the court. I\r\n       declare you guilty of contempt and sentence you to be confined\r\n       in the County Jail for twenty-four hours. Mr. Sheriff, take\r\n       him into custody.\"\r\n\r\n [148] The two principal points on which the defense based their\r\n       applications for writs of habeas corpus and of prohibition\r\n       were:\r\n\r\n       (1) That Juror Wise, having sat on a petty jury within a year,\r\n       was disqualified to act as a Grand Juror, and hence the\r\n       indictments were fatally defective.\r\n\r\n       (2) That the matter was before the Supreme Court of the United\r\n       States on a writ of error.\r\n\r\n [149] Heney, in his affidavit in contention that an Elisor should be\r\n       appointed to bring Ruef into court, indicated the conditions\r\n       which were handicapping the prosecution.\r\n\r\n [150] Biggy afterwards became Chief of Police of San Francisco.\r\n\r\n [151] Ruef was with one of his henchmen, Myrtile Cerf, when\r\n       arrested. Long after, when he had plead guilty to one of the\r\n       extortion charges, Ruef stated in an interview published in\r\n       the San Francisco Call, May 16, 1907, that it had been his\r\n       purpose \"to wait until the Legislature had acted on the Change\r\n       of Venue Bill,\" which was considered in a previous chapter,\r\n       and which at the time of Ruef's flight was being engineered\r\n       through the Senate by George Keane in his capacity as Senator.\r\n       Ruef, in his interview, stated further: \"We had expected that\r\n       this bill would go through. Naturally we were surprised when\r\n       we learned that Campbell, the Mayor's (Schmitz's) attorney,\r\n       was at Sacramento lobbying against the bill. What his object\r\n       was I do not know. He even went to George Keane, who had\r\n       charge of the bill, and tried to switch him to the other\r\n       side.\"\r\n\r\n       During the period of Ruef's disappearance, his attorneys had\r\n       insisted that they were unaware of his whereabouts. Myrtile\r\n       Cerf, his companion in flight, refused to say before the Grand\r\n       Jury with whom he had telephonic communication while at the\r\n       roadhouse, on the ground that such testimony might incriminate\r\n       him.\r\n\r\n [152] Ruef's arrest threw the administration into the greatest\r\n       confusion. Supervisor Wilson testified at the trial of The\r\n       People vs. Ruef, No. 1437, Part 3, Vol. 7, p. 3175, that at 2\r\n       o'clock of the morning following Ruef's capture, he went down\r\n       to Henry Ach's apartment to ascertain if the rumor that Ruef\r\n       had been found were true.\r\n\r\n [153] Of the procedure which made possible Ruef's long technical\r\n       fight to escape trial, the San Francisco Chronicle on November\r\n       10, 1906, said:\r\n\r\n       \"The disgraceful condition of our criminal laws permits guilty\r\n       men to put off their doom almost without limit. Where money\r\n       makes unscrupulous talent available that course is invariably\r\n       taken by those caught in the toils of justice. There are many\r\n       objects to be gained by these delays. Witnesses may die or be\r\n       spirited away. Most important of all the public becomes\r\n       wearied and finally forgets or loses its zest for the\r\n       enforcement of the law. When that stage is reached the 'pull'\r\n       comes into play. By the connivance of the District Attorney,\r\n       and especially of the Judge, continuance after continuance can\r\n       be granted until proof becomes impossible and the case is\r\n       dismissed. The adoption of such a course by any accused person\r\n       of bad reputation is moral evidence of guilt which is\r\n       conclusive with the public. We have had in this city many\r\n       disgraceful criminal trials. We have had many obvious\r\n       miscarriages of justice. There have been wealthy men whom\r\n       everybody feels should be in the penitentiary who have hardly\r\n       ceased for a day to flaunt their faces in decent society. We\r\n       have never had a case in which the obstruction to the cause of\r\n       justice began so early as Ruef began it, or was conducted with\r\n       such brazen effrontery. It is not within our recollection that\r\n       any accused person of whose guilt there was reasonable doubt\r\n       had adopted such a course. Its adoption is the recognized sign\r\n       of guilt.\r\n\r\n       \"But while our laws affecting court practice are very bad,\r\n       they do afford the means of ultimately bringing criminals to\r\n       trial and convicting them if the evidence is sufficient and\r\n       the jury unbiased and uncorrupted. It only requires that the\r\n       public maintains its interest and thereby sustains its\r\n       officials in their efforts to secure justice. In this case the\r\n       advantage is with the public. There is no possibility of a\r\n       'pull' with the District Attorney. His assistant, Mr. Heney,\r\n       is himself a master of the criminal law and in notable cases\r\n       elsewhere has triumphed over similar efforts for delay made in\r\n       behalf of criminals of far higher social and political\r\n       standing than Ruef. In fact Ruef has no standing of any kind\r\n       in the community in any way different from that possessed by\r\n       other political bosses supposed to be corrupt. The indignation\r\n       of this community is a righteous indignation and it will never\r\n       abate until under the due processes of law the truth in\r\n       respect to Ruef and his roustabouts is dragged out in open\r\n       court.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n                      TRAPPING OF THE SUPERVISORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonths before the Oliver Grand Jury was convened, it was common gossip\r\nin San Francisco that the members of the Board of Supervisors were\r\ntaking money from the public service corporations.[154] Belief of this\r\nhad got beyond the stage of mere newspaper accusation. It had become the\r\nfirmly-settled conviction of the law-abiding element of the community.\r\nFor this reason, as the months wore away in technical wrangling in the\r\n\"French Restaurant\" extortion cases, the public became impatient that\r\ntime and energy should be expended in comparatively unimportant matters,\r\nwhile big graft went unprobed.\r\n\r\nPartisans of the administration took advantage of this sentiment to\r\nbelittle the prosecution.\r\n\r\nUnder this sort of hammering, the prosecution, during the months of\r\nFebruary and March, 1907, unquestionably lost ground in public opinion.\r\n\r\nBut with Ruef holding the Supervisors to rigid accounting, and agents of\r\npublic-service corporations lynx-eyed[155] to detect any weakness in\r\ntheir position, and quick to report with warning and advice to Ruef at\r\nany suggestion of danger, Burns and his associates were able to make\r\nlittle headway in securing evidence of big graft that would justify\r\nindictment or warrant trial.\r\n\r\nThe Supervisors looked to Ruef absolutely. Some of them took bribe money\r\nfrom others than himself in spite of his warning, but when they scented\r\na trap they hurried to Ruef for advice.\r\n\r\nWhen he directed them to return the bribe money they promised to do so,\r\nand in some cases actually returned it.\r\n\r\nRuef was a competent captain over men who had all confidence in his\r\nability to keep them out of trouble. So long as he was in touch with the\r\nSupervisors his position so far as the Supervisors was concerned was\r\nalmost impregnable. When, however, Ruef was caught in a position where\r\nhe could no longer consult freely with his men, advise them and reassure\r\nthem, his organization went to pieces in a wild scramble of every member\r\nthereof to save himself.\r\n\r\nThis occurred when Ruef was placed in the custody of Elisor Biggy.\r\n\r\nRuef fully appreciated this weak point in his position. He realized from\r\nthe beginning of the Graft Prosecution the danger of members of the\r\nBoard of Supervisors being trapped in independent bribery, and himself\r\nbecoming involved through their confessions. Even before his flight from\r\ntrial in the extortion case, he knew that his fears bade fair to be\r\nrealized.\r\n\r\nSome fortnight before Ruef's flight, Supervisor Lonergan had been to\r\nRuef with confession of having taken $500 from Golden M. Roy. Roy was\r\nproprietor of a well-known cafe and was counted by men in Lonergan's\r\nposition as one of the supporters of the administration. But the more\r\nastute Ruef at once suspected betrayal. Ruef bluntly informed Lonergan\r\nthat he had been trapped, directed him to return the money Roy had given\r\nhim and warned him of the risk he ran in accepting bribes.\r\n\r\nRuef's fears were well founded. Roy, in his dealings with Lonergan, was\r\nacting for Detective William J. Burns.\r\n\r\nThe trap which Burns had prepared for the eager Lonergan was plausibly\r\nbaited.\r\n\r\nRoy was a restaurant keeper with several side enterprises, among them\r\ninterests in a skating-rink. An ordinance regulating skating-rinks was\r\npending before the Supervisors. Roy, acting under direction of the\r\nDistrict Attorney, approached Lonergan with a statement that he wished\r\nthe ordinance defeated. Lonergan accordingly met Roy at the skating-rink\r\noffice. In an adjoining room, placed so they could see and hear, were\r\nDetective William J. Burns and two others. From their places of\r\nconcealment the three men heard the bargain, and saw Roy pay Lonergan\r\n$500 to defeat the skating-rink ordinance.\r\n\r\nRoy, acting for the District Attorney, then attempted to trap Gallagher.\r\nHe offered Gallagher $1000 for his work on the skating-rink ordinance.\r\nGallagher refused to take any money and said that Roy was a friend of\r\nthe administration and it should not cost him anything. Roy urged\r\nGallagher to accept the money, alleging that it came from a pool; that\r\nGallagher was entitled to it; that he, Roy, had given money to several\r\nSupervisors already. Gallagher asked him to tell which ones. Roy\r\nrefused, saying, \"You would not expect me to tell on you.\"\r\n\r\nGallagher immediately suspected Lonergan and told his suspicions to\r\nWilson, and the two hunted up Lonergan and charged him with getting the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nGallagher hurried Lonergan to Ruef much the same as they would have\r\nrushed a man showing the symptoms of a deadly malady to a physician.\r\nRuef warned him and advised him. The thoroughly frightened Supervisor\r\nassured Ruef that he would be careful in the future, and that he would\r\nreturn the money he had received from Roy.[156]\r\n\r\nBut even as Ruef was dealing with Lonergan, Supervisor Edward I. Walsh\r\nwas walking into a trap set in duplication of that into which Lonergan\r\nhad fallen.\r\n\r\nWalsh, at the skating-rink, with the eyes of Burns and others upon him,\r\naccepted $500 from Roy--who was working as before under direction of the\r\nDistrict Attorney--as the price of his vote on the skating-rink\r\nordinance.\r\n\r\nThe third Supervisor to fall into the District Attorney's trap was Dr.\r\nCharles Boxton.\r\n\r\nDr. Boxton[157] was a different type from Lonergan and Walsh. He had had\r\nthe advantage of superior education and training. A specially prepared\r\ntrap was set for him at Roy's house. Boxton was introduced into the\r\nfront room separated from the dining-room by folding doors. The\r\ndining-room had been darkened, and the folding doors left slightly ajar.\r\nBurns, with his assistants, was concealed in the dining-room, where\r\nthey could see all that took place in the front room, as well as hear\r\nwhat was said. They saw Roy offer Boxton the money; heard him tell\r\nBoxton that the ordinance was to be defeated; saw Boxton take the money.\r\n\r\nThe trap was to be sprung once more, with Lonergan, for the second\r\ntime,[158] the victim.\r\n\r\nLonergan, instead of returning the $500 he had accepted in the\r\nskating-rink transaction, as he had promised Ruef he would do, accepted\r\nan additional $500 from Roy. As before, Burns and his men witnessed the\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nRoy had told Lonergan of an ordinance authorizing the establishing of an\r\noil refinery in which Roy claimed to be interested. He promised Lonergan\r\n$500 to support the measure. The ordinance had been cleverly prepared,\r\nwith an acrostic in the title, spelling the word \"Fake.\"[159] Roy had\r\ninterested Boxton in the measure as well as Lonergan. Boxton had\r\nintroduced it at a regular meeting of the Board of Supervisors. On March\r\n7, while Ruef was a fugitive, Lonergan went to Roy's house to get the\r\nmoney to be paid him for the support of the \"Fake\" ordinance.\r\n\r\nThe same arrangements had been made for Lonergan as for Boxton. Burns\r\nand his men were concealed in the darkened dining-room; the folding\r\ndoors were ajar. Lonergan took the money.\r\n\r\n\"What,\" he demanded of Roy, \"have you in the next room?\" and advanced\r\ntoward the partially-open folding doors. At that Burns threw the doors\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said Burns, \"what he has in there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to arrest this man,\" cried Lonergan, indicating Roy. \"He\r\nbribed a Supervisor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I saw him do it,\" replied Burns. \"But you did not tell me to\r\narrest him when he bribed you down at the skating-rink.\"\r\n\r\nLonergan at first denied the skating-rink incident, but finally admitted\r\nit. Langdon and Heney were sent for, and joined the party at Roy's\r\nhouse. Lonergan was urged to tell what he knew of graft of the\r\nSchmitz-Ruef administration. He finally consented. It was not a long\r\nstory. Supervisor James L. Gallagher had acted as go-between, Lonergan\r\nstated, from Ruef to the Supervisors. From Gallagher, Lonergan\r\ntestified, he had received $475 to influence his vote in the ordinance\r\ngranting permits to the organized prize fight promoters to hold fights\r\nonce a month; $750 to influence his vote in fixing gas rates at 85 cents\r\nper thousand instead of 75 cents, as had been pledged in the Union Labor\r\nparty platform on which he had been elected; $3500 in the matter of\r\ngranting the Home Telephone Company's franchise; $4000 for his vote in\r\ngranting the United Railroads its permit to establish the overhead\r\ntrolley system. Lonergan stated further that Gallagher had promised him\r\n$750, and later $1000, to influence his vote in the matter of passing an\r\nordinance for the sale of a franchise applied for by the Parkside Realty\r\nCompany, with the \"biggest thing yet\" to come, when the deal was\r\nconsummated, by which the city would accept the plans of the Bay Cities\r\nWater Company.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the sums received from Gallagher, Lonergan confessed to\r\nreceiving $5000 from T. V. Halsey, representing the Pacific States\r\nTelephone and Telegraph Company. Halsey had paid Lonergan the money, the\r\nSupervisor said, to oppose the granting of a franchise to the Home\r\nTelephone Company.\r\n\r\nWalsh and Boxton were sent for. On their arrival at Roy's house they\r\nwere closely questioned, and urged to confess, but neither would make a\r\nstatement that night. Boxton insisted that he would admit nothing unless\r\nthe other Supervisors made statements. But on the following day, March\r\n8, Walsh made a statement under oath to the District Attorney and Heney,\r\nin which he confessed to receiving bribes from Gallagher, except in the\r\nHome Telephone bribery, in the same amount and under like conditions\r\nthat Lonergan had stated bribes had been paid him.\r\n\r\nStartling as these confessions were, they as a matter of fact involved\r\nnone but Lonergan, Walsh, Gallagher and Halsey. At no point did they\r\ntouch Ruef, or Schmitz, or those who had furnished the bribe money.\r\nBoxton with Walsh and Lonergan had been trapped in bribery. Two had\r\nconfessed to receiving money from Gallagher, but even though the third,\r\nBoxton, added his confession to theirs, it would not have provided\r\nsufficient to convict. The confessions of the three were uncorroborated\r\nas to each bribe. The remaining fifteen Supervisors would to a certainty\r\nhave sworn they voted for the several measures without inducement. With\r\nsuch testimony from the fifteen, no motive could have been shown for\r\nGallagher to bribe Lonergan, Walsh and Boxton; the measures could, with\r\nthe votes of the fifteen, have been passed without the votes of the\r\nthree Supervisors trapped. To make out even a fairly good case against\r\nRuef, it was absolutely essential to have Gallagher's testimony, and in\r\naddition thereto, the testimony of a majority of the members of the\r\nBoard of Supervisors.[160]\r\n\r\nThe prosecution had made progress in trapping the three Supervisors, and\r\nin getting confession out of two of them. But at best it was only an\r\nopening wedge. The least slip would have lost all the ground gained. The\r\nthree trapped Supervisors might be sent to State Prison. Had they been,\r\nSchmitz with the fifteen Supervisors remaining would have filled their\r\nplaces by appointment. The situation would then be more difficult for\r\nthe prosecution than ever.\r\n\r\nWhile the agents of the District Attorney were dealing with the\r\ncomplicated problems which the first break in the line of the graft\r\ndefense brought upon them, Ruef continued a fugitive. Gallagher, Ruef's\r\nimmediate representative, realized the seriousness of the situation. He\r\nhad no real loyalty for Ruef. His one thought was for Gallagher. He\r\ncould for the moment see no hope for himself, except in the defeat of\r\nthe prosecution. He accordingly exerted himself to block Burns, and to\r\nprevent the conditions of graft in the Board of Supervisors from\r\nbecoming public.[161] Supervisor Wilson was assisting him. As\r\nencouragement, the anxious Ruef had sent Gallagher word by his sister to\r\nremain firm. But the leader was gone; Ruef's grip was loosened. From\r\nGallagher down to the wretched Lonergan, the Supervisors were thinking\r\nof saving themselves alone.\r\n\r\nRuef's word, sent by his sister to Gallagher, was for Gallagher \"to sit\r\non the lid.\" Gallagher soon after observed to Wilson that \"the lid was\r\ngetting a little warm\"; that he thought he would get in touch with the\r\nprosecution to see what could be done with the other side. Wilson\r\nassured Gallagher that he considered such a move would be a wise one.\r\n\r\nGallagher's first definite word that as many as three Supervisors had\r\nbeen trapped reached him through Dr. Boxton's attorney, H. M. Owens.\r\nOwens told Gallagher that Boxton had made full statement of the\r\nsituation to him and that he was convinced, and so was Boxton, that if\r\nBoxton went to trial he would be convicted.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this information upon Gallagher can be appreciated when it\r\nis realized that Gallagher, acting as Ruef's go-between, had himself\r\npaid Boxton money. Owens stated further that the question of giving the\r\nSupervisors immunity, provided they made complete confession, had been\r\nbroached, and the suggestion had been made that Gallagher meet some\r\nmember of the prosecution to discuss this point. The names of Langdon\r\nand Burns were suggested, but Gallagher did not care to meet them. He\r\nfinally agreed, however, to an appointment with Rudolph Spreckels.\r\n\r\nBefore the meeting between Gallagher and Spreckels took place, Langdon,\r\nHeney, Spreckels and Burns had a conference. It was suggested that\r\nSpreckels might indicate to Gallagher that the prosecution would like to\r\nhave his confession and statement, and that the District Attorney would\r\nunquestionably be able to extend to him immunity[162] on the strength of\r\nhis giving full and free, truthful testimony concerning crimes in which\r\nhe was involved while acting as a Supervisor in connection with the\r\npublic service corporations and others.\r\n\r\nThree meetings were held between Spreckels and Gallagher before the\r\nmatter was concluded. The meeting-place was in the grounds of the\r\nPresidio, the military reservation at San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe first of the three meetings was preliminary only. Spreckels\r\nexplained to Gallagher the aims and purposes of the prosecution.[163]\r\nGallagher would make no admissions, and indicated that under no\r\ncircumstances would he consider the District Attorney's immunity\r\nproposition unless all the Supervisors were included within its\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nAfter this preliminary meeting, Spreckels conferred with Langdon and\r\nHeney. It was agreed that Gallagher's testimony was essential. He was,\r\nindeed, the pivotal witness. The confessions of Lonergan, Boxton and\r\nWalsh showed that he had carried the bribe money from Ruef to the\r\nSupervisors. Furthermore, the testimony of a majority of the Supervisors\r\nwould be necessary. Under the circumstances it was decided that immunity\r\ncould very properly be extended to all the Supervisors.\r\n\r\nThis decision Spreckels took back to Gallagher. Gallagher called his\r\nleaderless associates together.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was generally known among the Supervisors that Lonergan,\r\nWalsh and Boxton had been trapped, that at least two of them had made\r\nstatements to the prosecution. Furthermore, there were rumors that other\r\nmembers had been to the prosecution and made confessions.\r\n\r\nGallagher explained the seriousness of the situation.[164] He explained\r\nto them the immunity proposition which the prosecution had made, and\r\nstated that the matter rested in their hands. He said that he was\r\nwilling to sacrifice himself, if necessary, but that the whole matter\r\nwas with them to decide.\r\n\r\nWilson and Boxton urged that the terms offered by the prosecution be\r\naccepted.[165]\r\n\r\nThe Supervisors present were at first divided. Some of them announced\r\nthat they would take the attitude of denying all graft.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" replied Gallagher, \"any one who wants to take that attitude\r\nwill be excused from further discussion.\"\r\n\r\nBut none of the troubled officials left the room.\r\n\r\nBoxton stated that he would involve Gallagher in a statement, and that\r\nGallagher would have to testify to all the money transactions he had had\r\nwith the board. The Supervisors knew, even then, that Gallagher had\r\nalready been involved by the confessions of Walsh and Lonergan. Under\r\nthe urging of Gallagher, Wilson and Boxton, they finally decided to make\r\nconfession.\r\n\r\nRuef was not present at that last secret caucus of the Schmitz-Ruef\r\nBoard of Supervisors.\r\n\r\nGallagher took back word to Spreckels that he had communicated to the\r\nSupervisors the message which Spreckels had delivered to him from the\r\nDistrict Attorney, to the effect that immunity would be granted to the\r\nSupervisors, provided they would make sworn declaration of the crimes\r\nin which they were involved, giving a truthful account of all matters.\r\nThe Supervisors, Gallagher told Spreckels, had decided to accept the\r\nproposition, and would meet the District Attorney for the purpose of\r\nmaking their statements.\r\n\r\nGallagher rather tardily asked immunity for Ruef, but Spreckels stated\r\nthat he had not discussed this feature with the District Attorney, and\r\nthat Gallagher would himself have to take the matter up with the\r\nauthorities directly.\r\n\r\nIn considering this immunity arrangement with the bribed Supervisors,\r\nthe fact should not be overlooked that during the five months which had\r\npassed since the opening of the graft prosecution, Spreckels and Heney\r\nhad been meeting officials of the public service corporations involved\r\npractically every day at luncheon. But the corporation officials would\r\ngive no assistance in exposing the corruption which was undermining the\r\ncommunity.[166]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [154] At the trial of The People vs. Ruef, No. 1437, Supervisor\r\n       Andrew M. Wilson testified to a conversation which he had had\r\n       with Ruef at Ruef's office early in September, 1906. He was\r\n       asked to state what he had said to Ruef on that occasion.\r\n       Wilson replied:\r\n\r\n       \"A. I told him Mr. Choynski was across the street; I pulled\r\n       the blind aside at his office, and showed him Mr. Choynski\r\n       talking to Jesse Marks; that he had stated to Marks the exact\r\n       amount on the trolley proposition.\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Sullivan: Q. Who had stated to Marks the exact amount on\r\n       the trolley proposition? A. Mr. Choynski, and that I had\r\n       advised him a few weeks before that not to continue that fight\r\n       for the attorneyship of the Liquor Dealers.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Advised who? A. Mr. Ruef; and that Mr. Choynski was\r\n       telling him what he had said to McGushin at one of the\r\n       meetings regarding the $4,000 on the trolley.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. That who had said what he had told Mr. McGushin? A. Yes,\r\n       sir.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. That who had said it? A. That Mr. Choynski had said that\r\n       McGushin looked paralyzed when he mentioned the exact amount,\r\n       but denied it; and I says to Mr. Ruef, 'He has the correct\r\n       amount on the trolley,' and he stated that there must be a\r\n       leak somewhere in the Board; and I told him I thought----\r\n\r\n       \"Q. (Interrupting). Who stated that there must be a leak\r\n       somewhere in the Board? A. Mr. Ruef; and I stated that I\r\n       thought it came through Morris Levy, and that possibly he got\r\n       his information through Supervisor Kelly, as they were very\r\n       friendly.\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Ach: Q. Who said that, you or Ruef?\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Sullivan: Q. Who said that? A. I stated that to Mr. Ruef,\r\n       that I thought the source of the leak was through Supervisor\r\n       Kelly telling Morris Levy, and Morris Levy telling\r\n       Choynski.\"--See Transcript, page 2643.\r\n\r\n [155] Supervisor James L. Gallagher testified at the trial of The\r\n       People vs. Ruef, No. 1437, of a note which had been delivered\r\n       to him by Mr. Abbott, attorney for the United Railroads, from\r\n       Tirey L. Ford, head of the United Railroads law department, to\r\n       be delivered to Ruef. The substance of the note, Gallagher\r\n       testified, was that \"The Grand Jury is taking up the\r\n       investigation of the charges concerning the United Railroads\r\n       permit; not much headway has been made; it is intended to\r\n       endeavor to trap some of the Supervisors.\"\r\n\r\n       Gallagher, unable to find Ruef, went back to Ford, according\r\n       to Gallagher's testimony, and asked if the note were so\r\n       important that Ruef should be hunted up. Ford had directed him\r\n       to open the envelope and read the note. Gallagher did this,\r\n       made a shorthand memorandum of it, and read the message to\r\n       Ruef later. See transcript, The People vs. Ruef, Part 3, Vol.\r\n       2, pp. 976 to 983.\r\n\r\n [156] An interesting incident of this transaction grew out of word\r\n       being carried to Roy, that Ruef had told Lonergan that Roy was\r\n       a stool pigeon for Burns. Roy went to Ruef's office with a\r\n       show of great indignation, demanding to know what Ruef meant\r\n       by such a charge. Ruef apologized and denied.\r\n\r\n [157] Boxton is thus described by Ruef, in his account of the graft\r\n       cases: \"Dr. Boxton was a dentist; he held the position of dean\r\n       and professor of dentistry in an established medical and\r\n       dental college. He was a popular man about town; had been one\r\n       of the grand officers of the Native Sons' organization; an\r\n       officer of the First California Regiment in the Philippines,\r\n       and had been several times elected Supervisor by large and\r\n       popular votes.\"\r\n\r\n [158] The reason for springing the trap on Lonergan the second time\r\n       was that the plan of Burns's had miscarried on the first trap.\r\n       Burns had put a man in partnership with Lonergan, who was to\r\n       induce Lonergan to cash a draft for $200, shortly after\r\n       Lonergan had received the $500 in marked currency.\r\n\r\n       When Lonergan was asked to cash the draft, he said all right,\r\n       but that he would have to go home and get the money. He went\r\n       home and brought back gold. About this time the Chronicle\r\n       published a story to the effect that several Supervisors had\r\n       been trapped.\r\n\r\n [159] The acrostic was made by skipping two lines to the third, the\r\n       first word of which began with \"F,\" then skipping two lines to\r\n       the sixth, skipping two lines to the ninth, and finally\r\n       skipping two lines to the twelfth; the first letter of the\r\n       first word of each of these lines spelt the word \"Fake.\"\r\n\r\n [160] With the testimony of all the Supervisors, including\r\n       Gallagher, the prosecution subsequently found great difficulty\r\n       in convicting Ruef. In the Parkside case, all the Supervisors\r\n       testified in regard to two promises made to them, and all the\r\n       officials of the Parkside Company testified to negotiations\r\n       with Ruef and to the payment of money to him. In addition\r\n       thereto, William J. Dingee, who was an entirely disinterested\r\n       party, testified to a conversation with Ruef, which was highly\r\n       incriminating in its character, and which amounted to an\r\n       admission on the part of Ruef that he was receiving money in\r\n       the Parkside matter.\r\n\r\n       With all this evidence before it, the jury stood six for\r\n       acquittal and six for conviction.\r\n\r\n [161] Wilson testified at the trial of The People vs. Ruef, No.\r\n       1437, of the anxiety of the Supervisors during this period.\r\n       Although Wilson had resigned from the board to accept the\r\n       office of State Railroad Commissioner to which he had been\r\n       elected, he went to a conference of the Supervisors to decide\r\n       what should be done. The following is from Wilson's testimony:\r\n\r\n       \"Q. You were not then a Supervisor, were you? A. No, sir.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Who told you to go there? A. I was helping Mr. Gallagher.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Helping Gallagher do what? Don't you know? A. Sit on the\r\n       lid, that is what we called it.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Helping Gallagher sit on the lid? A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. What does 'sitting on the lid' mean? That is a bit of the\r\n       vernacular that I am not acquainted with.\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Dwyer: That is vernacular authorized by the\r\n       President-elect of the United States, I suppose it is good\r\n       English?\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Ach: Well, he is a big man; I suppose he might sit on\r\n       something that might be a lid. The Court: Finish your answer.\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Ach: Q. What do you mean? A. Trying to keep the facts of\r\n       the condition of the Board of Supervisors from becoming\r\n       public.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. What do you mean by that? A. The condition of the Board,\r\n       the graft matters.\"\r\n\r\n [162] At the trial of The People vs. Patrick Calhoun, No. 1436,\r\n       Spreckels testified to his own attitude on the question of\r\n       immunity. He said: \"I would be willing to grant immunity to\r\n       any man who would bring to bar a man of great wealth who would\r\n       debauch a city government, and who would use his wealth to\r\n       corrupt individuals and tempt men of no means to commit a\r\n       crime in order that he might make more money.\"--See transcript\r\n       of testimony, page 3326.\r\n\r\n [163] At the trial of The People vs. Ruef, No. 1437, Gallagher\r\n       testified that Spreckels told him in substance as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Spreckels then stated that he was not actuated by\r\n       vindictiveness in the matter, that he did not wish to make any\r\n       more trouble or cause any more distress than was necessary in\r\n       carrying out what he had undertaken, and that his purpose was\r\n       to endeavor to stop the unlawful transactions,--dealings of\r\n       corporations and large interests in this city with public\r\n       officials; that his reason, that his view of the matter was\r\n       that in order to accomplish that, that it would be necessary,\r\n       or that he did not desire unnecessarily to injure anyone, and\r\n       that the members of the Board of Supervisors and those who\r\n       were engaged with them in the matter, outside of those who\r\n       represented the corporations and big interests, were not as\r\n       important from his standpoint as those who had, as those in\r\n       control of those interests, because the members of the--the\r\n       public officials and political bosses would come and go, but\r\n       that the corporations and big interests remained; that they\r\n       were, as he thought, the source of the trouble, and therefore,\r\n       he did not consider it important, or so important, to punish\r\n       the officials as to reach those that were in his judgment\r\n       primarily responsible for the conditions, that he felt that\r\n       the District Attorney would grant immunity to the members of\r\n       the Board of Supervisors if they would tell the whole truth of\r\n       their transactions with the corporations and other persons,\r\n       large interests, that had had any dealings with them of an\r\n       unlawful character. I think I then said to him I would\r\n       consider the matter and would talk with the members of the\r\n       Board of Supervisors about it.\"\r\n\r\n [164] Gallagher at the trial of The People vs. Ruef, No. 1437, made\r\n       the following statement of what he said to the Supervisors:\r\n\r\n       \"My best recollection of the statement is that I said to them\r\n       that some of the members of the Board of Supervisors had been\r\n       trapped in accepting money on some matters before the Board,\r\n       and that they had made statements to the prosecution, as I\r\n       understood, or were about to do so, and that I had seen Mr.\r\n       Spreckels and talked with him concerning the other members of\r\n       the Board of Supervisors, and that Mr. Spreckels had stated to\r\n       me that the purpose was not to prosecute the members of the\r\n       Board of Supervisors provided they would make statements, full\r\n       and true statements, of their relations in the transactions\r\n       with the quasi-public corporations and large interests in the\r\n       city that they may have had unlawful dealings with; that Mr.\r\n       Spreckels had stated that the public officials were coming and\r\n       going, and that the political bosses were coming and going;\r\n       his object was to reach the source of the condition that he\r\n       was trying to eradicate; that the corporations and these other\r\n       interests remained all the time, and that he felt that they\r\n       were the ones that should be the object of his efforts at\r\n       eradicating that condition in the city. Mr. Spreckels stated\r\n       that he was not actuated by vindictiveness in the matter; in\r\n       other words, Mr. Ach, as nearly as I could, I repeated the\r\n       statements of Mr. Spreckels to me.\"\r\n\r\n       See Transcript on Appeal, page 1471.\r\n\r\n [165] \"I told them,\" said Wilson in his testimony in the case of The\r\n       People vs. Ruef, No. 1437, \"that I had always taken orders\r\n       from Mr. Ruef, that I looked upon him as the political captain\r\n       of the ship, that I had followed out his orders; that I did\r\n       not feel that I should sacrifice myself, or ask Mr. Gallagher\r\n       to sacrifice himself through the condition that had been\r\n       brought about; that I thought it would be unreasonable for any\r\n       Supervisor to ask Mr. Gallagher to sacrifice himself, that\r\n       some of the others might walk the streets and feel that they\r\n       were honest men; that I did not feel he should be sacrificed\r\n       alone in the matter.\"\r\n\r\n [166] The public service corporation officials were encouraged by\r\n       Spreckels and Heney to give information which would lead to\r\n       the indictment and conviction of Ruef and Schmitz, and thus\r\n       clean up the city. Instead of giving such information, they\r\n       pretended that the rumors in regard to bribery were all\r\n       baseless.\r\n\r\n       At the Pacific Union Club, where they generally lunched,\r\n       Spreckels and Heney were the recipients of many kind words of\r\n       encouragement and of congratulation, up to the time that Ruef\r\n       plead guilty in the French-restaurant case. Immediately\r\n       thereafter the atmosphere commenced to change. The indictment\r\n       of some of the prominent members of the club was not pleasing.\r\n       During the first trial of Glass, he and his attorneys\r\n       constantly lunched at the Pacific Union Club, and many men,\r\n       prominent in finance, would stop and chat ostentatiously with\r\n       Glass and his lawyers, and would then ignore Spreckels and\r\n       Heney, who would be sitting at a near-by table.\r\n\r\n       An attempt to keep Rudolph Spreckels out of membership in the\r\n       Bohemian Club was almost successful about this time, while\r\n       Drum was elected a director of the Pacific Union Club while\r\n       still under indictment, and Thomas Williams, of the New\r\n       California Jockey Club, one of the bondsmen for Schmitz, was\r\n       elected President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n                   CONFESSIONS OF THE SUPERVISORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resignation of Supervisor Duffey to take charge of the municipal\r\ndepartment of public works, and of Supervisor Wilson[167] to take the\r\noffice of State Railroad Commissioner, left sixteen members of the\r\nelected Schmitz-Ruef Board of Supervisors at the time of the exposures\r\nof the graft prosecution. The sixteen, after the surrender at their last\r\nsecret caucus, made full confession of their participation in the gains\r\nof the organized betrayal of the city.\r\n\r\nSupervisor Wilson added his confession to the sixteen. Thus, of the\r\neighteen Union Labor party Supervisors elected in 1905, four years after\r\nthe organization of that party, seventeen[168] confessed to taking money\r\nfrom large combinations of capital, the very interests which the party\r\nhad been brought into being to oppose. The public service corporations,\r\nconfronting a party organized primarily to control municipal government\r\nto the end that equitable conditions in San Francisco might be\r\nguaranteed those who labor, by the simple process of support before\r\nelection and bribery after election, secured as strong a hold upon the\r\ncommunity as their most complete success at the polls could have given.\r\n\r\nThese large interests, approaching the new order with bribe-money, found\r\npoliticians operating in the name of organized labor, ostensibly to\r\npromote the best interests of labor, to be not at all formidable. And\r\nwhen the exposure came, and the bribe-giving corporation magnates were\r\nplaced on their defense, their most potent allies in the campaign which\r\nthey carried on to keep out of the penitentiary, were found in the\r\nentrenched leaders of the Union-Labor party.\r\n\r\nThe Supervisors' confessions corroborated the statements previously made\r\nby Lonergan, Walsh and Boxton.\r\n\r\nThe bribery transactions to which the seventeen Supervisors confessed,\r\ncame naturally under two heads:\r\n\r\nThe first class included the briberies carried on through Ruef, who\r\ndealt directly with those who furnished the bribe money. Ruef employed\r\nGallagher as agent to deal with the Supervisors. Thus Gallagher did not\r\ncome in contact with those who furnished the money, while the\r\nSupervisors were removed still further from connection with them. Ruef,\r\non his part, in passing the money, did not come into immediate contact\r\nwith the Supervisors except in Gallagher's case. It was bribery reduced\r\nto a fine art. In this group of transactions were included the bribery\r\nof the Supervisors to grant to the United Railroads its trolley permit;\r\nto the Home Telephone Company, its franchise; to the Pacific Gas and\r\nElectric Company, an 85-cent gas rate; to the prize fight combine,\r\nmonopoly of the pugilistic contests in San Francisco. In this class,\r\ntoo, is properly included the Parkside Transit Company, which had, at\r\nthe time the exposure came, paid Ruef $15,000 to secure a street\r\nrailroad franchise, with a promise of $15,000 more when the franchise\r\nhad been actually granted. The Supervisors received nothing in this\r\ntransaction, but they had been told by Ruef's agent, Gallagher, there\r\nwould be, first $750 each for them in the Parkside matter. Later on they\r\nwere told the sum would be $1000 each.\r\n\r\nThe second class of bribes included those which were paid directly to\r\nthe Supervisors. They included the bribes paid by T. V. Halsey, agent of\r\nthe Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company to a majority of the\r\nSupervisors to prevent their awarding the Home Telephone Company its\r\nfranchise. Gallagher did not participate in these bribery transactions,\r\nand could only indirectly throw light upon them. But in the other cases\r\nGallagher was the pivotal witness. He received the bribe money from\r\nRuef, and, after taking out his share, he paid the balance to the other\r\nSupervisors.\r\n\r\nWith a wealth of detail, Gallagher told how he had received the money,\r\nwhen and where, and went into the particulars of its distribution among\r\nhis associates. He had received from Ruef in all, $169,350.[169] Of\r\nthis, he had retained $27,275 for himself; the balance, $142,075, he\r\nhad divided among his associates on the board.\r\n\r\nThis enormous corruption fund which Gallagher divided with the\r\nSupervisors had come from four sources. The so-called prize-fight trust\r\nhad furnished $9,000 of it; the Pacific Gas and Electric Company,\r\n$13,350; the Home Telephone Company, $62,000, and the United Railroads,\r\n$85,000.\r\n\r\nThe first money that passed from Ruef to Gallagher and from Gallagher on\r\nto the Supervisors, the confessions showed, was for the prize-fight\r\nmonopoly. This particular bribery seems to have been intended as a\r\ntrying-out of the several members to ascertain which of them would take\r\nmoney in connection with the discharge of their duties as Supervisors.\r\n\r\nEvery member of the board accepted the package of bills which Gallagher\r\ntendered him. Indeed, several of them displayed surprising alertness to\r\nsecure all that was their due. Ruef, it became known among them, had\r\ngiven Gallagher $9000, which evenly divided, meant $500 for each of the\r\neighteen Supervisors. But Gallagher gave them only $475 each. An\r\nexplanation was demanded of him. He stated that he had taken out 5 per\r\ncent. as his commission.\r\n\r\nSo strong was the dissatisfaction created by the holding out of this 5\r\nper cent. that Ruef arranged to pay Gallagher a larger amount than the\r\nothers received to compensate him, no doubt, for his extra services as\r\nbribe-carrier.\r\n\r\nThe new arrangement for the compensation of Gallagher was followed when\r\nthe Supervisors were paid after fixing gas rates at 85 cents per\r\nthousand cubic feet, instead of 75 cents,[170] the sum pledged in their\r\nparty platform.\r\n\r\nOne of the Supervisors, McGushin, refused to break his platform pledge,\r\nand held out for the 75-cent rate. In distributing the gas money,\r\nGallagher paid nothing to McGushin.[171]\r\n\r\nBut to each of the remaining sixteen Supervisors, Gallagher confessed to\r\ngiving $750. Following the new rule that he was to have extra\r\ncompensation, Gallagher kept for himself $1350.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the gas-rate bribery, Supervisor Rea was making it\r\nunpleasant for his associates. Mr. Rea had accepted $475 prize-fight\r\nmoney from Gallagher, without, he testified before the Grand Jury,\r\nknowing what it was for. A few days later he told Schmitz of the matter.\r\nSchmitz contended that no such work was going on. Rea, when he received\r\nhis $750 in the gas-rate case, went to Schmitz with a statement that\r\nmoney was used to have the gas rate fixed at 85 cents. Rea asked Schmitz\r\nwhat he was to do with the money. He testified before the Grand Jury\r\nthat Schmitz replied: \"You keep quiet. I will let you know.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the last Rea heard from Schmitz on the subject. Rea testified\r\nbefore the Grand Jury that he still had the money Gallagher had paid him\r\nin the prize-fight and gas-rate cases.\r\n\r\nRea's trip to Schmitz seems to have kept him out of the division of the\r\nTelephone and the United Railroads money.\r\n\r\nThe Telephone bribery was somewhat complicated by the fact that rival\r\ncompanies were in the field bidding for Supervisorial favor. It\r\ndeveloped that eleven of the Supervisors[172] had accepted from T. V.\r\nHalsey, representing the Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company,\r\nbribes to block the granting of a franchise to the Home Telephone\r\nCompany. On the other hand, the Home Telephone Company had paid Ruef\r\n$125,000[173] to be used in getting favorable action on its application\r\nfor a franchise. Ruef gave Gallagher $62,000 for the Supervisors. Ruef\r\nstates that he divided the remainder with Schmitz. In this way, the\r\nadministration was bribed to grant the Home Telephone franchise, while\r\neleven[174] of the Supervisors, a majority of the board, were bribed not\r\nto grant it.\r\n\r\nThe complications which this created almost disrupted the Ruef-Schmitz\r\ncombine. The difficulty was threshed out in a Sunday night caucus. Those\r\nwho had received money from the Pacific States people, with Supervisor\r\nBoxton at their head, insisted that the Home franchise should not be\r\ngranted. On the other hand, Ruef and Schmitz, with the thousands of the\r\nHome Company in view, insisted that it should be. Both Ruef and Schmitz\r\nwarned the Supervisors that they were perhaps at the dividing of the\r\nways.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied Boxton significantly, \"if men cannot get a thing through\r\none way they might try and get it through in another.\"\r\n\r\nMayor Schmitz demanded of Boxton what he meant by that. \"Well,\" Boxton\r\nreplied vaguely but defiantly, \"you know there are other ways of\r\nreaching the matter.\"[175]\r\n\r\nBut Boxton was unable to prevail against the support which Ruef and\r\nSchmitz were giving the Home Telephone Company. Although eleven of the\r\nSupervisors had taken money from the Pacific States Company to oppose\r\nthe granting of a franchise to the rival Home Telephone Company, all but\r\nfour of those present at the caucus decided to stand by Ruef and\r\nSchmitz, and voted in caucus to grant the Home Company its\r\nfranchise.[176]\r\n\r\nThe next day, in open board meeting, with Boxton still leading the\r\nopposition, the franchise was awarded to the Home Telephone Company.\r\n\r\nThe division of the money received from the Home Telephone Company\r\npeople was one of the hardest problems in bribe distribution which Ruef\r\nand Gallagher were called upon to face.\r\n\r\nThe first plan was to pay the Supervisors who had at the last supported\r\nthe Home Telephone franchise, $3500. At once those Supervisors who had,\r\nfrom the beginning remained faithful to the administration's support of\r\nthe Home Company and had refused to accept money from Halsey, pointed\r\nout that they would receive $3500 only, while the Supervisors whom\r\nHalsey had bribed would get in all $8500; that is to say, $3500 from\r\nGallagher for voting to grant the franchise and $5000 from Halsey not to\r\ngrant it. It was, those who had remained true contended, inequitable\r\nthat Supervisors who had been faithful to Ruef and Schmitz from the\r\nbeginning should receive only $3500; while those who had been\r\ntemporarily bought away from the administration received $8500.\r\n\r\nThe \"justness\" of this contention appealed to all. A compromise was\r\nfinally arranged, under which those who had stood out to the end against\r\ngranting the Home franchise, should receive no part of the Home\r\nTelephone bribe money; those who had received $5000 from Halsey but\r\nfinally voted for the Home franchise, were to return $2500 of the $5000\r\nto Halsey, and receive $3500 from Gallagher, making the total of the\r\ntelephone bribe money for each $6000; those who had received nothing\r\nfrom Halsey were each to be allowed $6000 of the Home Telephone money.\r\nIn this way each Supervisor who had voted for the Home franchise would\r\nget $6000 for his vote. In the case of four of the Supervisors the\r\nentire $6000 came from the Home Company. Gallagher, too, was one of this\r\nclass, all his compensation being Home Telephone money. But Gallagher\r\nreceived $10,000. Eight of the Supervisors had received money from\r\nHalsey, and yet voted to give the Home Company its franchise. These\r\nreceived $3500 Home Company money from Gallagher and were allowed to\r\nkeep $2500 of the Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company money\r\nthat Halsey had given them. Thus the Pacific States was forced to pay\r\nthe Supervisors part of the bribe money they received for granting its\r\nrival a franchise. Incidentally, some of the Supervisors did not return\r\nhalf the $5000 to Halsey. But this is a phase of the ethics of bribery\r\nupon which it is unnecessary to touch.\r\n\r\nRuef regarded this unique discipline of the Pacific States as just\r\npunishment for its offense of trying to buy his Supervisors away from\r\nhim.[177]\r\n\r\nFollowing the telephone bribery, came that of the United Railroads to\r\nsecure the much-opposed over-head trolley permit. On account of this\r\npermit, Gallagher testified, Ruef had given him $85,000 to be\r\ndistributed among the Supervisors.\r\n\r\nOf this $85,000, Gallagher kept $15,000 for himself, gave Wilson\r\n$10,000,[178] and to each of the other Supervisors with the exception of\r\nRea,[179] $4000.\r\n\r\nGallagher's testimony relative to the offer of a bribe in the matter of\r\nthe Parkside Realty Company franchise was quite as explicit. He swore\r\nthat Ruef had stated to him there ought to be $750 for each Supervisor\r\nin this. Later on, with a change in the proposed route,[180] Ruef had\r\ntold Gallagher that the amount would be $1000 to each Supervisor.\r\nGallagher had conveyed this information to the Supervisors. At the time\r\nof Ruef's flight, arrest and the attending breaking up of his\r\norganization, the Supervisors were impatiently waiting for this money to\r\nbe paid.[181]\r\n\r\nOne by one, sixteen of Gallagher's associates went before the District\r\nAttorney and made full confession. In every detail they bore out\r\nGallagher's statements. When they had done, the District Attorney had\r\nstatements from seventeen[182] of the eighteen Supervisors, that they\r\nhad received large sums of bribe money to influence their votes in\r\nmatters in which public service corporations were concerned; he knew the\r\npurposes for which the bribe money had been paid; he had a statement\r\nfrom Gallagher, corroborated at many points by the testimony of the\r\nother Supervisors, that the money had been furnished by Ruef. Ruef's\r\ntestimony would bring the bribery transactions directly to the doors of\r\nthose who had bribed. This testimony could have been had, had the\r\nprosecution agreed to give Ruef complete immunity.\r\n\r\nRuef was a prisoner in charge of an elisor. He knew that the Supervisors\r\nhad confessed. In an agony of indecision he sent for Gallagher and\r\nWilson to learn from them all that had occurred.[183] They told him that\r\nfull statements had been made to the District Attorney. Ruef complained\r\nthat Gallagher should have tried to get into touch with him before\r\nmaking statements. To which Gallagher replied that such a course would\r\nhave been impossible.[184] Both Gallagher and Wilson advised Ruef to\r\nmake terms with the District Attorney. Ruef replied that he would think\r\nit over. Little came of the conference. The statements of the two\r\nSupervisors, however, must have shown Ruef how thorough the undoing of\r\nhis organization had been, and how hopeless was his own case. But Ruef,\r\nsparring for time, and pleading for complete immunity, did not make\r\nimmediate confession and, as a matter of fact has not, up to the\r\npresent writing, told the full story of his connection with the public\r\nservice corporations.[185]\r\n\r\nAfter the confessions of the Supervisors, the District Attorney left\r\nRuef to himself and hastened the Supervisors before the Grand Jury,\r\nwhere they repeated their miserable stories.[186]\r\n\r\nAnd then the Grand Jury took up the task of tracing the bribe money from\r\nthose who had received it, to those who had paid it.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [167] To the places thus vacated, Mayor Schmitz appointed O. A.\r\n       Tveitmoe and J. J. O'Neil. Tveitmoe and O'Neil assumed their\r\n       duties as Supervisors after the bribery transactions were\r\n       completed. They did not become involved in the graft\r\n       exposures, but served to the end of the terms for which they\r\n       had been appointed.\r\n\r\n [168] The eighteenth Supervisor, who made no confession, was Duffey.\r\n       Duffey, according to Gallagher's confession, participated with\r\n       the others in the graft distributions. In the hurry of the\r\n       final arrangements for the confessions, however, Gallagher\r\n       gained the impression that confession was not to be required\r\n       of Duffey. Rather than give appearance of lack of good faith,\r\n       the prosecution decided to abide by the impression which\r\n       Gallagher claimed he had formed.\r\n\r\n [169] This was the amount that Ruef turned over to the Supervisors.\r\n       It represented a comparatively small part of what he received\r\n       from the Public Service corporations. From the United\r\n       Railroads alone, because of the granting of the trolley\r\n       permit, he received $200,000. In addition he was drawing a\r\n       regular fee of $1,000 a month from the United Railroads.\r\n\r\n       The Supervisors were not always satisfied with the amount\r\n       Gallagher gave them. There were times when they entertained\r\n       the idea that Ruef had sent more than Gallagher gave. They\r\n       accordingly delegated Supervisor Wilson to ascertain from Ruef\r\n       whether all the money intended for them was reaching them.\r\n       Ruef refused to discuss the matter with Wilson. Wilson, at the\r\n       trial of The People vs. Ruef, No. 1437, testified:\r\n\r\n       \"I told him (Ruef) that the Supervisors had asked me to call\r\n       and see him; that they wanted other information to confirm Mr.\r\n       Gallagher's reports to the Board on these money matters. He\r\n       said that he did not care to discuss that with anyone other\r\n       than Mr. Gallagher; that it took up time and that whatever Mr.\r\n       Gallagher did on the Board was with his full knowledge and\r\n       consent; that the matters were being handled satisfactorily by\r\n       Mr. Gallagher, and when anything arose, any other condition\r\n       confronted him, he would look elsewhere for a leader, but he\r\n       did not want to go in at that time and discuss those matters\r\n       with anyone.\"\r\n [170] About the time the 85-cent gas rate was fixed, one of the\r\n       Pacific Gas and Electric Company's stations was burned. Ruef\r\n       stated to Gallagher that the fire would be used as one of the\r\n       reasons for fixing the 85-cent rate: that it would probably\r\n       appeal to the public as an excuse for fixing the rate at 85\r\n       cents when the platform of the party had mentioned 75 cents.\r\n       See Transcript, The People vs. Ruef, No. 1437, page 784.\r\n\r\n [171] When McGushin refused to follow directions and give the\r\n       Pacific Gas and Electric Company an 85-cent gas rate,\r\n       Gallagher went to Ruef about it. At the trial of The People\r\n       vs. Ruef, No. 1437, Gallagher testified: \"I told him (Ruef)\r\n       that McGushin was rather demurring at receiving the money, at\r\n       taking the money, and that I had told Mr. McGushin that he had\r\n       better go down and talk with Mr. Ruef. He (Ruef) said, 'All\r\n       right, if he comes around I will talk with him.'\"\r\n\r\n [172] The Supervisors who accepted money from Halsey, acting for the\r\n       Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company, to prevent a\r\n       franchise being awarded an opposition company were: Boxton,\r\n       Walsh, Wilson, Coleman, Nicholas, Furey, Mamlock, Phillips,\r\n       Lonergan, Sanderson and Coffey. The amount paid in each\r\n       instance was $5,000. Halsey promised several of the bribed\r\n       members from $2,500 to $5,000 in addition to be paid them, if\r\n       they remained faithful, after their terms had expired. The\r\n       money, the several members testified, had been paid to them by\r\n       Halsey in an unfurnished room in the Mills Building which had\r\n       been temporarily engaged for Mr. Halsey's use by Frank C.\r\n       Drum, a director of the Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph\r\n       Company. Examples of the methods employed to corrupt the\r\n       laboringmen Supervisors who suddenly found themselves placed\r\n       in a position of trust and responsibility will be found in the\r\n       appendix.\r\n\r\n [173] This is the amount given by Ruef in his \"confession.\" He\r\n       states that he received $25,000 when he agreed that the Home\r\n       Telephone Company should have the franchise; and $100,000 when\r\n       the franchise was granted. According to his statement he gave\r\n       $65,000 to Gallagher for the Supervisors; $30,000 he gave\r\n       Schmitz; $30,000 he kept himself. Gallagher testified on\r\n       several occasions that he received but $62,000 from Ruef. The\r\n       details of Ruef's confessions are not dependable. On Ruef's\r\n       own statement of the basis of division of this particular\r\n       bribe money among the Supervisors, Gallagher received only\r\n       $62,000 of Home Telephone money from him.\r\n\r\n [174] Ruef was himself to blame for the complication, for he had\r\n       given certain of the Supervisors to understand that the\r\n       purpose of the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company was to\r\n       prevail, and that the Home Telephone Company would not be\r\n       granted its franchise. The Supervisors in taking the Pacific\r\n       Telephone and Telegraph Company's money, not unreasonably\r\n       supposed they were taking from the favored of the\r\n       administration. Supervisor Wilson in his confession said: \"The\r\n       first conversation I had with Mr. Ruef, affecting money\r\n       matters, was on the Pacific States Telephone matters. I told\r\n       him that I had been out to dinner with Mr. Halsey, and I\r\n       understood that everything was going to be satisfactory with\r\n       their company. He (Ruef) said that it would terminate that\r\n       way.\"\r\n\r\n       Acting upon this hint, Wilson accepted $5,000 from Halsey.\r\n       Later he told Ruef of having got the money. Ruef told him that\r\n       he should not have taken it. Wilson has testified that he\r\n       offered to return it. \"No,\" he claims Ruef replied, \"don't do\r\n       that just now. Wait and see. I will let you know later. You\r\n       might get into a trap by giving it back; you had better wait.\"\r\n\r\n       Ruef claims, however, that he advised Wilson to return the\r\n       money.\r\n\r\n [175] For description of this \"dividing of the ways\" scene, see\r\n       testimony of Supervisor Wilson, Transcript on Appeal, The\r\n       People vs. Ruef, page 2843.\r\n\r\n [176] Gallagher in his confession said of the decision of the\r\n       Supervisors to stand by Ruef and Schmitz: \"Mr. Wilson talked\r\n       to a number of those boys (Supervisors who had taken money\r\n       from the Pacific States's agent), he being one of those who\r\n       had taken this money, and he told me that notwithstanding the\r\n       fact that they had taken this money that he didn't feel that\r\n       he wanted to stand out from the leadership of Mr. Ruef and\r\n       wanted to act with him and myself in the matter and said that\r\n       he would talk to the other boys about it, and see how they\r\n       felt about the proposition of voting for the Home Telephone\r\n       franchise anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n [177] In his confession, Gallagher stated that under this\r\n       arrangement he paid $3,500 each to Coffey, Coleman, Furey,\r\n       Lonergan, Mamlock, Nicholas, Phillips and Wilson; $6,000 each\r\n       to Davis, Duffey, Harrigan and Kelley, reserving $10,000 for\r\n       himself. Those who received no part of the Home Telephone\r\n       Company money were Boxton, Sanderson, Walsh, McGushin and Rea.\r\n       Of the five, Boxton and Sanderson received $5,000 each from\r\n       Halsey of the Pacific Company, and Walsh, according to his\r\n       recollection, $3,500. McGushin and Rea received none of the\r\n       bribe money paid by the two telephone companies.\r\n\r\n [178] Gallagher testified before the Grand Jury, that the additional\r\n       compensation had been given Wilson because he was more useful\r\n       than any other member, besides himself, in keeping the\r\n       Supervisors in line and in passing information regarding\r\n       prospective bribe money.\r\n\r\n [179] Gallagher testified before the Grand Jury that he had paid Rea\r\n       nothing, because he had no confidence in Rea's judgment and\r\n       self-control. \"I told Mr. Ruef,\" Gallagher testified, \"I did\r\n       not care to, that I wouldn't take the responsibility of\r\n       dealing with Mr. Rea. I believe he was talking and had talked\r\n       about matters dealing with me and did not care to have any\r\n       dealings with him. He (Ruef) said, 'Very well, I'll attend to\r\n       him,' or 'I will see to that myself,' or some such expression\r\n       as that.\"\r\n\r\n [180] The original plan was to have this road on Twentieth Avenue.\r\n       But to grade Twentieth Avenue would take time, and cost\r\n       upwards of $100,000. On the other hand, Nineteenth Avenue had\r\n       been graded, macadamized, and accepted as a boulevard. The\r\n       Parkside people asked a change in the purchased franchise, to\r\n       give them the boulevard. But the Charter prohibited grants of\r\n       franchises over declared boulevards. Ruef concluded this\r\n       provision could be overcome by ordinance. He feared criticism,\r\n       but finally yielded to the Parkside people's request. Then\r\n       went word to the Supervisors of increase in compensation in\r\n       this particular transaction.\r\n\r\n [181] Gallagher's testimony before the Grand Jury regarding the\r\n       promised bribes in the Parkside franchise undertaking was as\r\n       follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Now, then, the Parkside trolley, was there an\r\n       understanding in regard to money being paid on that? A. The\r\n       Parkside realty company's franchise for street railway on\r\n       Twentieth Avenue, that is what you refer to--on Nineteenth\r\n       Avenue, that is correct; it was originally intended for\r\n       Twentieth, afterward changed to Nineteenth; that is right\r\n       there was nothing paid to any member of the Board upon that\r\n       that I know of. There were some rumors about it and Mr. Ruef\r\n       spoke to me about it and said there ought to be a payment of\r\n       $750 to each member on it and afterward said that if the thing\r\n       was changed from Twentieth Avenue to the Nineteenth Avenue,\r\n       that there ought to be $1,000 each paid.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. About when did he say it ought or he would be able to pay\r\n       them? A. He said that he expected to, yes, sir. He did not say\r\n       he was ready to do so, on the contrary, has always denied that\r\n       he had the money to pay it with.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. He never said he had the money before on the other matters?\r\n       A. No.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. He would just say there will be this much coming? A. Yes,\r\n       sir.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. And the same way in regard to this also? A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. $1,000? A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. And you passed it out in the same way? A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. And it was put through with that understanding? A. Yes,\r\n       sir.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. The only definite, was it, it hasn't come? A. Not yet.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Do you know why the money hasn't been given to you yet by\r\n       Ruef? A. No, sir.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Has he given you any reason? A. Mr. Ruef said that the\r\n       amount has not been paid to him.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. You heard complaints from the members that they had been so\r\n       long about coming through? A. Yes, indeed.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Did you make complaint to Ruef about it? A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. What did he say? A. He made that excuse consequently that\r\n       he didn't have it.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Never said that he did not expect it? A. Did not.\"\r\n\r\n [182] The anxiety on the part of the confessing Supervisors to tell\r\n       the truth was pathetic. When McGushin began his story he was\r\n       asked: \"Of course this statement you make is free and\r\n       voluntary.\" \"Yes,\" replied McGushin, simply, \"Mr. Gallagher\r\n       himself told me to tell the truth.\"\r\n\r\n [183] \"I want to learn from your own lips,\" he told Wilson, \"if what\r\n       I have already heard is true regarding your making a statement\r\n       to the prosecution.\"\r\n\r\n       \"I have been thoroughly informed,\" said Ruef in an interview\r\n       given out later, \"of everything that the members of the Board\r\n       of Supervisors are reported to have told the Grand Jury, and I\r\n       have no comment to make upon their alleged confessions at this\r\n       time. Later, however, I will issue a statement which will\r\n       furnish more sensations in connection with municipal graft\r\n       than anything that has been made public.\"\r\n\r\n [184] Gallagher left the conference first. Wilson testified at the\r\n       graft trials that after Gallagher had gone Ruef stated that\r\n       \"had he been in Gallagher's place he wouldn't have made those\r\n       statements to the prosecution.\"\r\n\r\n       \"You can never tell what one will do until he is placed in Mr.\r\n       Gallagher's position,\" replied Wilson, \"we discussed the\r\n       matter fully for two or three days before he took that step.\"\r\n\r\n [185] The nearest Ruef has come to a statement of his connection\r\n       with the public service corporations is contained in his\r\n       story, \"The Road I Traveled,\" which appeared In the San\r\n       Francisco Bulletin. The account is inaccurate and incomplete.\r\n       Nothing, for example, is told by Mr. Ruef, of the proposed Bay\r\n       Cities Water Company deal, which at one time he claimed to be\r\n       the most important of all he had in view.\r\n\r\n [186] The Supervisors were all examined before the Grand Jury on the\r\n       same day. Heney in an affidavit, filed in the case of The\r\n       People vs. Calhoun et al., No. 823, states that \"one of the\r\n       reasons which actuated me to examine all of said Supervisors\r\n       on the same day was that the newspapers had discovered that\r\n       they had made confessions on the preceding Saturday, and I\r\n       wanted to make sure that no one of them was tampered with by\r\n       anyone who might be interested in changing his testimony\r\n       before I succeeded in getting his testimony recorded by a\r\n       stenographer in the Grand Jury room.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n                     THE SOURCE OF THE BRIBE MONEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the confessions of the Supervisors, the Grand Jurors had definite,\r\ndetailed knowledge of the corruption of the Union-Labor party\r\nadministration. The Grand Jurors knew:\r\n\r\n(1) That bribes aggregating over $200,000 had been paid the Supervisors.\r\n\r\n(2) That of this large amount, $169,350 passed from Ruef to Gallagher\r\nand by Gallagher had been divided among members of the board. The\r\nbalance, the evidence showed, had been paid to the Supervisors direct by\r\nT. V. Halsey of the Pacific States Telephone Company.\r\n\r\n(3) The amount of each bribe; the circumstances under which it was paid;\r\neven the character of the currency used in the transaction.\r\n\r\n(4) The names of the corporations benefited by the bribery transactions,\r\nas well as the character of the special privileges which their money had\r\nbought.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Home Telephone Company, the names of the\r\ndirectors of these benefiting corporations were readily\r\nobtainable.[187]\r\n\r\nWith this data before them, the Grand Jurors proceeded to trace the\r\nsource of the bribe money.\r\n\r\nNaturally, men who had long held places of respectability in the\r\ncommunity were slow to admit having given Ruef vast sums, even under the\r\ntransparent subterfuge of paying him attorney's fees.[188] Some of them,\r\nwhen haled before the Grand Jury, testified reluctantly, and only under\r\nthe closest questioning. Others frankly stood upon their constitutional\r\nrights, and with pitiful attempt to smooth out with studied phrases the\r\nharshness of the only acceptable reason for their refusal, declined to\r\ntestify on the ground that their testimony would tend to incriminate\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Grand Jury succeeded in wringing from the officials of\r\nthe several corporations involved, damaging admissions; admissions, in\r\nfact, quite as startling as had been the confessions of the Supervisors.\r\nThe refusal of some of those not unreasonably under suspicion, to\r\ntestify was, too, quite as significant.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of the bribery of the Supervisors by T. V. Halsey, agent\r\nof the Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company, the Grand Jury\r\nhad information that eleven Supervisors had been paid over $50,000 to\r\noppose the granting of a franchise to the Home Telephone Company. A\r\nmajority of the payments were made in an unfurnished suite of three\r\nrooms in the Mills Building. Frank Drum, a director of the company,\r\nadmitted having engaged the rooms at Halsey's request. E. J. Zimmer,\r\nauditor for the company, testified that Halsey held the position of\r\nGeneral Agent of the company. Halsey's duties, the testimony showed,\r\nwere assigned him by Louis Glass, vice-president and general manager,\r\nand for a time acting president of the company. Halsey, under the\r\ncompany's organization, reported to Glass. Zimmer testified that Halsey\r\ncould not spend the company's money except on the proper approval of the\r\nexecutive officer of the company. From October, 1905, when President\r\nSabin of the company died, until February, 1906, when Henry T. Scott,\r\nSabin's successor, was elected, Glass acted as president and as\r\nexecutive officer. He had, according to Auditor Zimmer, authority to\r\napprove expenditures made by Halsey. After Scott's elevation to the\r\npresidency, either Glass or Scott could have approved such expenditures.\r\nZimmer testified further to giving Halsey, at Glass's order,[189] as\r\nhigh as $10,000 at a time. Halsey[190] gave no vouchers for these large\r\nsums; they did not appear on the books;[191] they were carried on tags.\r\n\r\nZimmer stated that he did not know for what the funds were used; had\r\nmerely followed out Glass's instruction, and given Halsey the money.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Thomas Sherwin threw some light upon the bookkeeping\r\nmethods followed. Sherwin had been traveling auditor for the American\r\nBell Telephone Company, which concern owned 51 per cent. of the stock of\r\nthe Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company. Later he took\r\nZimmer's place as auditor of the Pacific States Company.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherwin admitted that some of Mr. Halsey's \"special expenses,\" at\r\nleast, were finally charged to the company's legal department.[192]\r\n\r\nPassing from the investigation of the bribery transactions of the\r\nPacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company to the activities of the\r\nHome Telephone Company, the Grand Jury examined prominent business men\r\nof Los Angeles as well as of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe plan of operation followed by the capitalists behind this enterprise\r\nwas to organize a construction company, whose part was to establish the\r\nplants, put them into operation and turn them over to the operating\r\ncompanies, taking their pay in the securities of the local operating\r\ncompany. Thus, at San Francisco, the Empire Construction Company played\r\nan important part in the Home Telephone Company enterprise.\r\n\r\nAs Heney put it, the Empire Construction Company received the most\r\nbenefit from the granting of the Home Telephone franchise. The Empire\r\nConstruction Company furnished at least part of the money that went into\r\nthe fusion campaign fund in 1905. Investigation showed that 25 per cent.\r\nof the stock of the Empire Construction Company belonged to men who were\r\nin the construction solely, while 75 per cent. was in the hands of men\r\nwho were financing the enterprise. This last block of stock at the time\r\nof the investigation was divided among James H. Adams and Thomas W.\r\nPhillips of the Adams-Phillips Company, A. B. Cass, Gerald S. Torrance\r\nand A. K. Detweiler. Detweiler could not be found. Adams, Cass and\r\nTorrance, after answering some of the questions put to them, availed\r\nthemselves of their constitutional privilege, and refused to make\r\nfurther answers. The books of the Adams-Phillips Company disappeared and\r\nemployees of that company undertook to evade answering questions\r\nregarding the disappearance, on the ground that they might incriminate\r\nthemselves. But a sharp order from the Superior Court brought out their\r\ntestimony. However, none of them gave testimony that led to the\r\ndiscovery of the missing volumes.\r\n\r\nBut the general trend of the testimony went to show that the responsible\r\nagent for the Empire Construction Company and the Home Telephone Company\r\nin San Francisco was A. K. Detweiler. The testimony showed Detweiler to\r\nhave been at Ruef's office in consultation with Ruef and Supervisor\r\nGallagher; he was active in every move that was made on behalf of the\r\nEmpire Construction Company and of the Home Telephone Company in San\r\nFrancisco, and had the disbursing of the funds.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, through the testimony of Dr. Fred Butterfield, a\r\nrepresentative of Adolphus Busch, the brewer, the Grand Jury learned\r\nthat a third telephone company, the United States Independent, seeking a\r\nfranchise to do business in San Francisco, would have bid for the\r\nfranchise which the Home Company received, had not the franchise been so\r\nworded that only the telephone system controlled by the Home people\r\ncould be operated under it. Butterfield stated that his company, made up\r\nof responsible capitalists, considered the franchise worth something\r\nover a million dollars, and was prepared to bid up to a million dollars,\r\nif necessary, to get it. The Home Company paid San Francisco $25,000 for\r\nthe franchise. Butterfield testified that his company had intended to\r\ninvest $4,500,000 in the San Francisco enterprise, and that Ruef knew of\r\nthe extent of the company's plans. With such testimony, the assertions\r\nof Ruef's partisans that opposition to the Ruef-Schmitz administration\r\nretarded development of the community compare curiously.[193]\r\n\r\nThe Grand Jury could not secure the attendance of Mr. Detweiler, for\r\nabout the time of the investigation Mr. Detweiler mysteriously\r\ndisappeared. The investigation into the affairs of the Home Company\r\nhad, therefore, to be concluded without Mr. Detweiler's testimony.\r\n\r\nFollowing the policy of the stockholders of the Empire Construction\r\nCompany, the officials of the United Railroads refused to testify.\r\nPresident Patrick Calhoun[194] and Thornwell Mullally, assistant to the\r\npresident, when given opportunity to state their side of the case under\r\noath, stood upon their constitutional rights, and declined to give\r\nevidence that might incriminate them.[195] They were accordingly excused\r\nfrom the Grand Jury room.\r\n\r\nBut the employees of the company did not escape so easily. When, for\r\nexample, George Francis, William M. Abbott, George B. Willcutt and Celia\r\nMcDermott refused to answer questions put to them in the Grand Jury\r\nroom, they were haled before the Superior Court, where they were\r\ninformed that they must testify.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the hostility of these witnesses, the prosecution succeeded\r\nin securing a wealth of data regarding $200,000 which passed into the\r\nhands of Tirey L. Ford and, according to the theory of the prosecution,\r\nfrom Ford to Ruef.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution established the fact that two days before Mayor Schmitz\r\nsigned the trolley permit, that is to say, on May 22, 1906, Patrick\r\nCalhoun, as president of the United Railroads, received by telegraphic\r\ntransfer from the East to the United States Mint at San Francisco,\r\n$200,000.[196] Two days later, the day the trolley permit was signed,\r\nPresident Calhoun took Ford to the Mint and instructed Superintendent\r\nof the Mint Leach to give Ford $50,000 of the $200,000. Ford told Leach\r\nthat he wanted currency. The currency was finally secured by exchanging\r\ngold for bills at the Mint headquarters of the relief work then being\r\ncarried on in San Francisco. These bills, it was shown, were all in\r\nsmall denominations, having been sent to San Francisco from all parts of\r\nthe country by individual subscribers to the relief fund.\r\n\r\nThis money was taken away from the Mint, the testimony showed, by Ford\r\nand William M. Abbott.\r\n\r\nSoon after, Ruef loaned Supervisor Rea[197] $3500. By a curious trick of\r\nfate Rea had leased a piece of property from Rudolph Spreckels. In\r\npayment on this lease he used the money that Ruef had loaned him. This\r\nmoney was all in bills of small denominations. Late in July Ruef gave\r\nGallagher $45,000, all in bills of small denominations, as partial\r\nsettlement with the Supervisors for granting the trolley permit.\r\nGallagher gave Wilson of this money $5000, and the other Supervisors\r\nwith the exception of Rea $2000 each. They all understood that it was\r\nbecause of the trolley franchise deal. The balance Gallagher retained\r\nfor himself.\r\n\r\nThe confessing Supervisors, with the exception of Wilson and Rea,\r\ntestified that their first payment on account of the trolley permit was\r\n$2000 each, in bills of small denominations. Wilson testified to having\r\nreceived $5000.\r\n\r\nLater, Ford, making two trips to the Mint, drew out the $150,000\r\nbalance of the $200,000 that had been telegraphed to Calhoun's credit.\r\nAs before, the Mint paid him in gold, and as before, Ford exchanged the\r\ngold for currency. But instead of getting bills of small denomination,\r\non the two trips which Ford made for that $150,000, he secured fifty and\r\none hundred-dollar bills.\r\n\r\nOn the day that Ford drew the last of that $200,000 from the Mint, an\r\nagent in the employ of the prosecution followed Ruef from his office to\r\nthe car barns in which Ford's office was then located. A few days later\r\nRuef gave Gallagher $40,000 in fifty and one hundred-dollar bills, the\r\ngreater part of which Gallagher distributed among the Supervisors as\r\nsecond and final payment on account of the granting of the trolley\r\npermit.\r\n\r\nIn the Parkside deal, the Grand Jury had little difficulty in tracing\r\nthe money involved. William H. Crocker,[198] a capitalist of large\r\naffairs, who owned the largest interest in the company, showed\r\nastonishing ignorance of the management. The Grand Jury learned little\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nBut those interested in the enterprise with Crocker not only told how\r\nhalf the money was paid Ruef, but how the books had been manipulated to\r\nconceal the payment.\r\n\r\nRuef, according to the testimony of officials of the company, had first\r\ndemanded $50,000 as price for his employment to put the franchise\r\nthrough, but had finally agreed to take $30,000. This amount, officials\r\nof the company testified, was provided by drawing two checks, one in\r\nfavor of H. P. Umbsen and the second in the name of Douglass S. Watson,\r\nsecretary of the Parkside Company. Umbsen and Watson thereupon deeded to\r\nthe Parkside Company two parcels of land. The transaction was then\r\ncharged to the purchase of property.[199] The property was deeded back\r\nto Umbsen and Watson at the same time, but these last deeds were not\r\nimmediately recorded.\r\n\r\nWatson cashed the checks at the Crocker-Woolworth Bank, of which William\r\nH. Crocker was president. He testified that he received currency for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe $30,000 he took to G. H. Umbsen. Half the $30,000 Umbsen paid Ruef.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the exposure, Umbsen[200] testified he was withholding\r\nthe second payment until the franchise should be put through.[201]\r\n\r\nIn the gas-rate case, the Grand Jury found that the corporation that\r\nwould, in the final analysis, benefit by the increase in gas rates, was\r\nthe Pacific Gas and Electric Company. The four responsible men in this\r\ncompany were found to be N. W. Halsey, John Martin, Eugene de Sabla and\r\nFrank G. Drum. Halsey was out of the State for the greater part of the\r\ntime and Cyrus Bierce, acting as treasurer of the corporation, looked\r\nafter his interests. This narrowed the responsibility down to de Sabla,\r\nMartin and Drum.\r\n\r\nDe Sabla testified before the Grand Jury that Ruef was not, to his\r\nknowledge, at any time on the pay roll of the company. Martin swore that\r\nhe knew of no money that had been expended in connection with the fixing\r\nof the gas rates, and expressed himself as being as surprised as anyone\r\nat the confessions of the Supervisors to having received money after the\r\ngas rates had been fixed. Later, after Ruef had plead guilty to\r\nextortion, both de Sabla and Martin refused to testify further before\r\nthe Grand Jury.[202]\r\n\r\nMr. Frank G. Drum, when called before the Grand Jury, stated that he had\r\nhad no conversation with Ruef in reference to the fixing of the gas\r\nrates.[203] But later Ruef told the Grand Jury that the money which he\r\nhad turned over to Gallagher in the gas-rate transaction had come from\r\nDrum.[204]\r\n\r\nThe first to be indicted because of these transactions was Ruef.\r\nSixty-five indictments were on March 20 returned against him. Eighteen\r\nwere based upon the bribing of Supervisors in the so-called fight trust\r\nmatter; seventeen upon the bribing of Supervisors in fixing the gas\r\nrates; thirteen upon the bribing of Supervisors in the matter of the\r\nsale of the Home Telephone Company franchise; seventeen in the matter of\r\ngranting the over-head trolley permit.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, ten indictments were returned against Theodore V.\r\nHalsey, of the Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company, for the\r\nbribery of Supervisors to prevent the sale of a franchise to a competing\r\ntelephone company. A number of indictments were found against A. K.\r\nDetweiler, for bribing Supervisors in the matter of the sale of the Home\r\nTelephone franchise. The Detweiler indictments, thirteen in number,\r\nwere based upon payments of money by Ruef to Gallagher, and by Gallagher\r\nto different members of the board. On March 23, the Grand Jury returned\r\nnine indictments against Louis Glass, vice-president of the Pacific\r\nStates Telephone and Telegraph Company, based upon the bribing, through\r\nHalsey, of Supervisors to prevent the granting of a competing telephone\r\nfranchise.\r\n\r\nDuring the two months that followed, the Grand Jury continued at the\r\nsteady grind of graft investigation. Finally, on May 24, one additional\r\nindictment[205] was brought against Halsey and two against Glass. On\r\nthat date, fourteen indictments were returned against Patrick Calhoun,\r\nThornwell Mullally, Tirey L. Ford, William M. Abbott,[206] Abraham Ruef\r\nand Mayor E. E. Schmitz, indicted jointly, for the bribery in connection\r\nwith the granting of the over-head trolley permit.\r\n\r\nThe day following, May 25, G. H. Umbsen, J. E. Green, W. I. Brobeck and\r\nAbraham Ruef were jointly indicted fourteen times on charges of offering\r\na bribe to fourteen Supervisors in the Parkside franchise matter. The\r\nsame day, fourteen indictments were returned against Frank G. Drum,\r\nAbraham Ruef, Eugene E. Schmitz, Eugene de Sabla and John Martin on\r\ncharges of giving and offering bribes to fourteen Supervisors in the\r\nmatter of fixing the gas rates.\r\n\r\nStill another series of graft indictments were to be found. Three\r\nprize-fight promoters, W. Britt, \"Eddie\" Graney and \"Jimmie\" Coffroth\r\nwere, on nine counts, indicted jointly with Schmitz and Ruef for bribery\r\nin connection with the awarding to them of virtually a monopoly of the\r\npromotion of prize fighting in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [187] The following persons sat on the Boards of Directors of the\r\n       several corporations involved in the graft disclosures, either\r\n       during 1906 when the briberies were committed, or during 1907\r\n       when the exposures came:\r\n\r\n       Pacific Gas and Electric Company--N.

H.\r\n       Davis, Tirey L. Ford, Benj. S. Guiness, I. W. Hellman, Chas.\r\n       Holbrook, A. C. Kains, J. Henry Meyer, Thornwell Mullally, Jos.\r\n       S. Tobin.\r\n\r\n       The names of the board of directors of the Home Telephone\r\n       Company, during the period of the bribery transactions, has\r\n       not, so far as the writer knows, been made public. A. C. Kains\r\n       resigned from the directorate of the United Railroads, and Jos.\r\n       S. Tobin from the directorates of the United Railroads and the\r\n       Pacific Gas and Electric Company, about the time of the\r\n       disclosures.\r\n\r\n [188] The inconsistency of the \"attorney fee plea\" is well\r\n       illustrated in the United Railroads transaction. Ruef received\r\n       $200,000 from the United Railroads because of the trolley\r\n       permit. General Tirey L. Ford, head of the United Railroads\r\n       law department, to which he devoted all his time, was credited\r\n       with receiving a salary of $10,000 a year. Thus Ruef's single\r\n       \"fee\" was as much as the United Railroads would have paid its\r\n       head lawyer in twenty years, almost a lifetime of professional\r\n       service. And Ruef, it must be remembered, in addition was\r\n       getting $1,000 a month from the United Railroads--more than\r\n       the chief of that corporation's legal department was\r\n       receiving.\r\n\r\n [189] Zimmer insisted at first that the total of the amounts which\r\n       he turned over to Halsey would not exceed $20,000. Later he\r\n       admitted that he had not kept track of the amounts, and the\r\n       total might have been $30,000. This he increased to $35,000,\r\n       and finally stated that it was \"not over $40,000, if it was\r\n       that.\" He admitted that it would have been possible for\r\n       Executive Officer Glass to have paid out $70,000 without his\r\n       knowledge. \"Checks,\" he said, \"could have been signed without\r\n       going through me; could have been carried just the same as\r\n       this tag account was.\"\r\n\r\n       William J. Kennedy, cashier and assistant treasurer of the\r\n       company, who had charge of the \"tags,\" stated that during\r\n       February, 1906, considerable amounts were drawn out in this\r\n       way, which might have totalled as high as $70,000.\r\n\r\n [190] Regarding the manner in which money was furnished to Halsey,\r\n       Zimmer testified before the Grand Jury as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Q. This $10,000 that you gave him (Halsey) under direction of\r\n       Mr. Glass, in what shape did you hand it to him? A. Currency.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Did you have the currency on hand or send out and get it?\r\n       A. Sent out and got it. I went out and got it.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Where did you get it? A. I don't remember, I had to go to\r\n       several banks.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Did Mr. Glass tell you he wanted you to give it to him in\r\n       currency? A. Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n [191] These admissions led to close questioning of Mr. Zimmer. The\r\n       following is taken from his testimony given before the Grand\r\n       Jury:\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Now, in what way did that money appear in the books? A.\r\n       Didn't appear in the books.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. How was it taken care of? A. No voucher was ever made for\r\n       it.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. How would your cash account for it? A. It wasn't taken out\r\n       of the cash account, so far as I know.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. What was it taken from? A. By check issued on the regular\r\n       bank account.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Who was the check made payable to? A. Eaton, treasurer, the\r\n       same as other coin checks are issued, coin or currency.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. It would have appeared somewhere in the books, that check,\r\n       that amount would be deducted from the bank account? A. Yes,\r\n       sir; but carried in the expense account of the cash suspense.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Leave a tag with you? Leave a tag, would you? A. Yes.\"\r\n\r\n [192] Before the Grand Jury, Sherwin was closely questioned as to\r\n       one of Mr. Halsey's \"Special expense\" claims. The following is\r\n       from his testimony:\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Now, then, that shows that it was charged against what\r\n       fund? A. That got in the legal expense finally, we charged it\r\n       to Reserve for Contingent Liabilities, and each month we\r\n       credit that account, I have forgotten maybe $2,000, and charge\r\n       it to legal to make it run even in the expense each month.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Why does it go to legal? A. Because--instead--to what else\r\n       would it go?\r\n\r\n       \"Q. What makes it legal? A. Oh, that's just a subdivision of\r\n       our expense.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Was this $600 legal expenses? A. I don't know what it was.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Who told you to put it under legal expenses? A. You mean\r\n       who told us to put it in that account?\r\n\r\n       \"Q. There is nothing on that paper that indicates that it goes\r\n       into legal expense? A. No.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Now, then, you say it was finally charged to the legal\r\n       department. Why? A. Simply because everything that is charged\r\n       to that reserve finally gets into legal expense.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Everything that is charged to that reserve fund? A. Yes,\r\n       that reserve fund is charged off for legal expense.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. And what is the reason for that? A. For charging it to\r\n       legal?\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Yes. A. For charging it to legal--because--I don't know the\r\n       reason--it is always done that way.\"\r\n\r\n [193] See Supervisors' letter to the Examiner, footnote 64, page 62.\r\n\r\n [194] Calhoun returned to San Francisco April 10. In interviews\r\n       published in the San Francisco papers of April 12, Calhoun\r\n       emphatically denied all knowledge of the bribery transactions.\r\n       In his interview in the Chronicle he said:\r\n\r\n       \"I wish to go on record before the people of San Francisco as\r\n       stating that not one of the officers or legal counsel of the\r\n       United Railroads of San Francisco or the United Railroads\r\n       Investment Company of New Jersey ever paid, authorized to be\r\n       paid, approved of paying or knew that one dollar was paid to\r\n       secure the passage of the trolley franchise ordinance by the\r\n       Board of Supervisors, and if I had known that one dollar was\r\n       paid for the purpose of securing this franchise I would not\r\n       have accepted it.\"\r\n\r\n [195] The refusal of Calhoun and Mullally to testify created a\r\n       sensation, even in those sensational times. The Chronicle in\r\n       its issue of May 4, 1907, printed the following account of the\r\n       incident:\r\n\r\n       \"For the first time in the history of the examination of\r\n       witnesses before this Grand Jury, Heney was careful not to\r\n       instruct the prospective witnesses as to their legal rights.\r\n       Instead he merely asked them if they were already familiar\r\n       with their rights under the law.\r\n\r\n       \"'I am aware,' said Calhoun, who was the first to be called,\r\n       'that anything I might tell this body might be used against\r\n       me.'\r\n\r\n       \"'With that understanding are you willing to become a witness\r\n       before this Grand Jury?' asked Heney.\r\n\r\n       \"'I am not,' was Calhoun's response.\r\n\r\n       \"The Jurymen who had leaned forward as the reply of the\r\n       president hung on his lips sank back in their seats.\r\n\r\n       \"'That is all, Mr. Calhoun,' said Heney to the president, and\r\n       then going to the door he said to the bailiff, 'Call Mr.\r\n       Mullally.'\r\n\r\n       \"Mullally's examination was identical with that of his\r\n       superior's and he was permitted to go. Neither President\r\n       Calhoun nor Assistant Mullally will be called again to the jury\r\n       room.\"\r\n\r\n       Calhoun issued the following statement of his refusal to\r\n       testify:\r\n\r\n       \"When called before the Grand Jury this afternoon and informed\r\n       that it had under investigation the alleged bribery of public\r\n       officials by the United Railroads, we declined to be sworn and\r\n       in order that our action may not be misconstrued, I call your\r\n       attention to these facts:\r\n\r\n       \"For months past the public prints have been full of charges\r\n       traceable to certain persons connected with the prosecution\r\n       that they had positive evidence that the United Railroads had\r\n       spent not less than $450,000 in bribing the officials of this\r\n       city. I have repeatedly stated that neither I nor the United\r\n       Railroads, nor any official of the United Railroads, had bribed\r\n       anyone, authorized any bribery, knew of any bribery or approved\r\n       of any bribery. This statement I now fully reaffirm. It is not\r\n       for us nor any officer of our company to disprove these grave\r\n       charges. It is for those making them to prove them. We do not\r\n       now care to discuss their motives. We know that they cannot\r\n       produce any truthful evidence connecting us or any officer of\r\n       the United Railroads with this alleged crime.\r\n\r\n       \"We relied, in declining to be sworn, upon the broad\r\n       Constitutional right of every American citizen that a defendant\r\n       cannot be called as a witness, and upon the justice, fairness\r\n       and common sense of the Grand Jury, to whom we look for\r\n       complete vindication without offering one word in our own\r\n       behalf.\"\r\n\r\n [196] For several weeks after the great fire of April 18-19-20,\r\n       1906, the banks were closed at San Francisco. Money could,\r\n       however, during this period, be transferred to San Francisco,\r\n       through the United States mint.\r\n\r\n [197] Gallagher had notified Ruef that he would not deal with Rea in\r\n       the trolley transaction. Ruef, Gallagher alleged, had agreed\r\n       to attend to Rea's case himself. See Chapter XIII.\r\n\r\n [198] Crocker testified before the Grand Jury, however, that he had\r\n       known Ruef for many years. \"He (Ruef) and my brother-in-law,\r\n       Prince Poniatowski,\" said Crocker, \"both being French, and\r\n       both being pretty clever men, struck up quite a friendship\r\n       together and through that means I used to see more or less of\r\n       Ruef and that was one of those peculiar friendships that\r\n       spring up with people who are not identified and not connected\r\n       in any way whatever in any business enterprise, sprang up\r\n       between Ruef and myself, and when he told me that in my office\r\n       it didn't surprise me a bit.\"\r\n\r\n       Crocker had testified that Ruef had promised to do all he\r\n       could to get him his franchise, and wouldn't want a dollar\r\n       from Crocker, or from the institution with which Crocker was\r\n       connected.\r\n\r\n [199] Of this manipulation of the books, President J. E. Green, of\r\n       the Parkside Company, testified before the Grand Jury as\r\n       follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Q. How was the transaction to appear in the books? How was\r\n       the property account to be charged with it? It would have to\r\n       show some property. A. It was charged for a block that was\r\n       purchased from Watson and Umbsen, a block of land.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Did you tell Watson to do that? A. I believe I did.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. How did they get paid for the land? A. They deeded this\r\n       block which they had to the company and the company in turn\r\n       executed a deed to them, returning the land to them, simply a\r\n       matter of bookkeeping.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Was the company's deed put on record? From them to the\r\n       company? A. I rather think so.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. What was the purpose of that? A. To get a charge to the\r\n       property account for the expenditure of that amount of money.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. What was the reason for charging it to property account? A.\r\n       Every expenditure that was made was charged to property account\r\n       with the idea the property had to pay it back.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Did you always go through the form with every expense that\r\n       wasn't actually a piece of property, did you go through a form\r\n       of deeding a piece of property and then deeding it back? A. No,\r\n       sir.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. What was the reason of doing it in this instance? A.\r\n       Because--other things--there was a case--grading, sewering or\r\n       fencing the blocks when they spoke for itself.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. I don't see how it helped you; it went to the property\r\n       account and the property went right out; don't see how it\r\n       helped you any. A. It had to be charged to something, Mr.\r\n       Heney.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Why couldn't it be charged to what it was, attorneys' fees?\r\n       A. Because attorneys' fees were charged against property\r\n       account.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Were Morrison & Cope's fees charged up as a piece of\r\n       property and did they go through a rigmarole of deeding a piece\r\n       of property too? A. No; their fees or any other expense against\r\n       the property interests.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Didn't they go into the books as a fee for Morrison & Cope\r\n       and charged as expenses against property? A. Charged direct to\r\n       property.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. As expense? A. Don't know as expense; it was charged to\r\n       property, showing that we had that much money in property; when\r\n       we got through selling anything over, that was profit in our\r\n       favor.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. It appeared on the books as having been paid to Morrison &\r\n       Cope for attorneys' fees? A. Can't say without seeing the\r\n       books.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Ordinary way of keeping books? A. Yes.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. You didn't cover up anything you paid to Morrison & Cope by\r\n       putting through the hands of the secretary? A. No, sir.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Why did you cover up this in connection with Ruef? A. I\r\n       don't know; suppose the property account is probably the proper\r\n       one to charge it to.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Only explanation of it? A. Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n [200] Early in the graft investigation Detective William J. Burns,\r\n       with studied carelessness, dropped a remark in the presence of\r\n       a salesman of the Parkside Company, that he had heard money\r\n       was being used in the Parkside case. Soon after, Thomas L.\r\n       Henderson, secretary of the company, received word from\r\n       William I. Brobeck, of the law firm of Morrison, Cope &\r\n       Brobeck, attorney for the Parkside Company, to call at that\r\n       firm's law office. Of the incident. Henderson testified before\r\n       the Grand Jury as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Q. His first question to you was what? A. We went in there.\r\n       He said, Mr. Henderson, I am going to talk to you about\r\n       Parkside and he said, have you an attorney? I said, no. I have\r\n       no attorney. He says, it might be well for you to get an\r\n       attorney. I said, all right. Mr. Brobeck, I will take you for\r\n       an attorney. He said, all right, I will take you for a client.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Then what was said? A. Then he spoke, he said, you know\r\n       about that remark made by Mr. Burns at Nineteenth and H. I\r\n       replied how I got the remark from Hooper who was the salesman\r\n       out there and I had passed it off, saying I did not want to\r\n       talk about it. Then he said to me, I can't remember just the\r\n       words, but his advice to me was not to say anything about it.\r\n       I told him certainly, I would not. Then he spoke about Umbsen.\r\n       Could I communicate with Gus? And I told him I could on the\r\n       4th of the month, he was then between Havana and Florida, and\r\n       would arrive in New York about the 4th. Do you think it would\r\n       be advisable to telegraph or write to him not to say anything?\r\n       I said: Oh, no, I don't see any necessity for doing that.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. What was the remark as you heard it that Burns made? A. We\r\n       were coming down on the Sutter street car, Mr. Kernan and\r\n       myself, when Ed Hooper, salesman, spoke to us and said: I had a\r\n       distinguished visitor yesterday. I said, who; he said, Mr.\r\n       Burns, the detective. He said, I knew something about the\r\n       telephone cases. I say what he said, a little something. He\r\n       asked me about that and started for the automobile and when he\r\n       got there, he turned around and said, another thing, I want to\r\n       ask you about, I heard Ruef got $30,000 from Parkside. Who\r\n       would be the man to see. I am only out here selling land and\r\n       don't know anything about that. I had been here with Watson\r\n       when he was agent and when Umbsen took charge he kept me in the\r\n       same job. He was the salesman out there, that was at that time\r\n       they had this automobile race and I turned around and said: I\r\n       see the Oldsmobile won the race in Los Angeles, because I\r\n       didn't want to continue the conversation with him.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Did Brobeck, in his conversation, tell you where he got the\r\n       information that Burns had been out there? A. No sir, he did\r\n       not.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Did he tell you that he knew what Burns had said? A. The\r\n       impression I got was that he knew. I don't remember his saying\r\n       in just so many words.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. He referred to the statement made by Burns? A. He may have\r\n       made the remark that you know about what was said out there.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. At the time you talked about your having an attorney did he\r\n       tell you to send him some money? A. After we finished he said,\r\n       'Mr. Henderson, you had better send me pay for this interview.'\r\n       I said what? and he said five or ten dollars and when I got to\r\n       the office, I mailed him a check for $10.\"\r\n\r\n [201] Ruef's version of the affair, as Ruef gave it before the Grand\r\n       Jury, was: \"Mr. Umbsen stated to me that with a great deal of\r\n       difficulty, he had been able to persuade the people interested\r\n       to allow me this fee. I thereupon told Mr. Gallagher that I\r\n       had made arrangements to secure for myself an attorney's fee\r\n       in the matter and I would allow him something over $13,500 as\r\n       his proportion of the fee. Mr. Gallagher estimated what it\r\n       would require for his services in the matter and we had\r\n       discussed would the Supervisors accept that amount.\"\r\n\r\n [202] John Martin's statement, when he refused to testify, furnishes\r\n       fair example of the attitude of those who became involved in\r\n       the graft scandal. The Grand Jury record shows:\r\n\r\n       \"John Martin recalled.\r\n\r\n       \"Foreman (to witness). You have already been sworn, so you can\r\n       consider yourself under oath. Mr. Martin: I desire to stand on\r\n       my constitutional right and not to testify further.\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Heney: If you feel that your testimony might have a\r\n       tendency to subject you to prosecution--. A. (interrupting).\r\n       No, not that. I am not so advised that that is necessary. My\r\n       constitutional rights are broader than that, I am advised.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Then you don't desire to testify? A. No, sir.\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Heney: All right.\"\r\n\r\n [203] Mr. Frank G. Drum testified as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Do you know Abraham Ruef? A. Met him.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Did you have any conversation with him about that time? A.\r\n       No, sir.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. I mean a conversation with reference to the rates? A. No,\r\n       not that I know anything about.\"\r\n\r\n [204] Ruef on this point testified before the Grand Jury as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"I received from Mr. Frank G. Drum, $20,000 as an attorney's\r\n       fee as spoken of between ourselves, about the time that the\r\n       gas rates were being fixed. Of that money, I gave to Mr.\r\n       Gallagher for the Board of Supervisors about, as I remember It\r\n       now, $14,000. It may have been a few hundred dollars more or\r\n       less. I think about $14,000. Mr. Drum spoke to me about\r\n       employing me in the service of the company some month or two\r\n       before, I believe, and engaged me as attorney to represent the\r\n       interests, as I understood it from him, which he represented\r\n       in the company, at $1000 a month, of which I received, I\r\n       believe, for two or three months. At the time of the fixing of\r\n       the gas rates some of the Supervisors, as I was informed by\r\n       Supervisor Gallagher, insisted upon fixing an extremely low\r\n       rate, such a rate as would have been ruinous to the business\r\n       of the company, a rate which neither I nor any one who had\r\n       looked up the question would have considered under any\r\n       circumstances to be reasonable, proper or maintainable, and\r\n       said they were determined absolutely to reduce those rates.\r\n       The matter was brought up at one of the Sunday evening\r\n       caucuses and some of the members of the Board of Supervisors\r\n       insisted that the board had been pledged by its platform to a\r\n       rate of 75c. per thousand feet; they thought that was even too\r\n       much and made some strong speeches and others maintained the\r\n       75c. rate and they contemplated fixing the 75c. rate that\r\n       evening, that is to say, agreeing to do it at the proper time\r\n       which I suppose was a week thereafter. In the meantime, the\r\n       company sustained a heavy fire loss, not the fire of April\r\n       18th, but the previous fire, which caused them a great deal of\r\n       damage, and I told Mr. Drum that it would be necessary for me,\r\n       in order to protect the interests of the company and the\r\n       interests which he represented, to have an additional\r\n       attorney's fee and I told him that I thought it would require\r\n       $20,000. He considered the matter and one day, a day or two\r\n       afterward, he agreed to pay me the additional attorney's fee\r\n       of $20,000 which I thereafter received.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Where did the conversation take place in which you told him\r\n       about the necessity of having the $20,000? A. At his office in\r\n       the Mills Building.\"\r\n\r\n [205] Although the Graft Prosecution was to be effectively opposed\r\n       by Union Labor party leaders, the San Francisco Labor Council,\r\n       made up of representatives of practically every San Francisco\r\n       labor union, on the night of March 23, 1907, adopted\r\n       resolutions declaring for the prosecution of bribe-givers as\r\n       follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Whereas, The indictments issued during the past few days by\r\n       the San Francisco Grand Jury against certain individuals\r\n       involve specific charges of flagrant and widespread corruption\r\n       on the part of many members of the present city government;\r\n       and whereas, said government, having adopted the name of\r\n       'Union Labor' has professed particular concern for the welfare\r\n       of the working class, as represented by organized labor, and\r\n       has sought and secured election upon pledges of loyalty to the\r\n       principles, economic and political, to which organized labor\r\n       everywhere is committed; and whereas, the alleged conduct of\r\n       the city government is not only grossly repugnant to the\r\n       principles of organized labor, but violates every rule of\r\n       common honesty; and whereas, the conduct of the 'Union Labor'\r\n       government and the inevitable association thereof with the\r\n       character of the labor movement is calculated to lead to\r\n       public misconception of the latter and thus to injure it and\r\n       lessen its efficiency in its chosen field, therefore be it\r\n\r\n       \"Resolved, By the San Francisco Labor Council, that we declare\r\n       that every corruptionist, briber and bribed, should be\r\n       prosecuted and punished according to law, and hereby pledge our\r\n       co-operation to that end; further\r\n\r\n       \"Resolved, That we reassert the position of the San Francisco\r\n       Labor Council as a body organized and conducted for purely\r\n       economic purposes, having no connection, direct or implied,\r\n       with the Union Labor party or any other political party or\r\n       organization, and therefore being in no way responsible for the\r\n       conduct or misconduct of any such party or organization;\r\n       further\r\n\r\n       \"Resolved, That we also reaffirm our belief that the private\r\n       ownership of public utilities constitutes the chief source of\r\n       public corruption, and is in fact a premium thereon, and\r\n       therefore ought to be displaced by the system of public\r\n       ownership of public utilities.\"\r\n\r\n [206] At the time Patrick Calhoun held the office of President of\r\n       the United Railroads; Mullally was assistant to the President;\r\n       Ford general counsel for the corporation. Abbott was Ford's\r\n       assistant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n                  RUEF PLEADS GUILTY TO EXTORTION.[207]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Supervisors were making full confessions of their\r\nparticipation in the bribery transactions, and the Grand Jury was\r\ndragging from unwilling promoters, capitalists and corporation employees\r\ninformation as to the source of the corruption funds, Ruef's days and\r\nnights were devoted to consideration of plans for his own safety. Ruef,\r\nafter his arrest and confinement under Elisor Biggy, became one of the\r\nscramblers of his broken organization to save himself.\r\n\r\nBut Ruef was more clever, more far-seeing than any of the Supervisors.\r\nHis course from the beginning indicates that, in considering confession,\r\nhe carefully weighed against the power of the regularly constituted\r\nauthorities of San Francisco to protect him if he testified for the\r\nState, the ability of organized corruptionists to punish for betrayal.\r\nRuef realized that although the all-powerful State \"machine,\" labeled\r\nRepublican, of which the San Francisco organization labeled Union Labor,\r\nwhich he had built up, was but a part, had for the moment lost control\r\nof the San Francisco District Attorney's office, but the \"machine\" still\r\ndominated the other departments of the municipal government, as well as\r\nof the State government[208]. Ruef realized that Langdon might die; that\r\nthe State Attorney General might set Langdon aside and himself conduct\r\nthe graft prosecution. And he realized that some day a district attorney\r\nother than Langdon would be prosecutor in San Francisco. In any of these\r\nevents, what would be the lot of the man who had betrayed the\r\nscarcely-known captains of the powerful machine?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the hour when the evidence which the District\r\nAttorney had accumulated against him would be presented before a trial\r\njury, approached with deadly certainty.\r\n\r\nSuch considerations led to Ruef devoting his days to resistance of the\r\nproceeding against him in the trial court, where a jury to try him on\r\none of the five extortion charges on which he had been indicted, was\r\nbeing impaneled, while his nights were given to scheming to wring from\r\nthe District Attorney immunity from punishment for the extortions and\r\nbriberies which had been brought to his door.\r\n\r\nThe period was one of activity for both District Attorney and Ruef. On\r\nthe whole, however, the District Attorney had the liveliest time of it.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, Ruef had been brought before the trial judge; that is to\r\nsay, the impaneling of a trial jury had begun, but Ruef's technical\r\nfight had not been abandoned for a moment.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Ruef under arrest was signal for a fight to have him\r\nadmitted to bail. But release under bonds Judge Dunne denied him on the\r\nground of the immediate approach of his trial, and because he had\r\nattempted to put himself beyond the process of the court. Ruef's\r\nattorneys appealed to the United States District Court for a writ of\r\nhabeas corpus, but this was denied them. His attorneys filed affidavits\r\nalleging bias and prejudice on the part of Judge Dunne against Ruef, and\r\ndemanding a change of venue. And with these various motions, all of\r\nwhich the District Attorney was called upon to meet, was the appeal from\r\nJudge Hebbard's order to the Federal Supreme Court, which was considered\r\nin a previous chapter.\r\n\r\nThe actual work of drawing a jury to try Ruef began on March 13,[209]\r\neight days later than the date originally set for trial. The State was\r\nrepresented by District Attorney Langdon, Francis J. Heney and Hiram W.\r\nJohnson. At the defense end of the table with Schmitz and Ruef were\r\nAttorneys Joseph C. Campbell, Samuel M. Shortridge, Henry Ach, Charles\r\nA. Fairall and J. J. Barrett. But it developed that one of the four\r\ncitizens drawn for jury service was not in the courtroom. The defense\r\nobjected to proceeding during the absence of the venireman. The hearing\r\nwas accordingly postponed. Because of one technical obstruction and\r\nanother, the work of impaneling the trial jury was delayed until April\r\n2. Even after that date there were interruptions, but the work of\r\nsecuring the jury[210] went on until May 13, when the twelfth man to try\r\nRuef was accepted.\r\n\r\nBut while Ruef was making this brave fight in public to head off trial\r\non the extortion charge, behind the scenes he was imploring\r\nrepresentatives of the Prosecution to grant him immunity from punishment\r\nin return for such confession as he might see fit to make.\r\n\r\nAs early as March 20, Ruef sent word to Heney through Burns[211] that he\r\nwas willing to make confession, provided he were given immunity from\r\npunishment for all crimes which he had committed or in which he had\r\nparticipated.\r\n\r\nHeney refused absolutely to consider any arrangement which involved\r\ncomplete immunity for Ruef. Negotiations on the basis of partial\r\nimmunity followed.[212]\r\n\r\nHeney, on the ground that he did not trust any of Ruef's lawyers,\r\nrefused to discuss the matter with them, but stated that he would meet\r\nany lawyer in whom he had confidence to negotiate terms of partial\r\nimmunity, provided that Ruef's representative were permitted:\r\n\r\n(1) To give the names of Ruef's accomplices who would be involved by his\r\ntestimony.\r\n\r\n(2) To give the general nature of the offenses in which the various\r\naccomplices were involved.\r\n\r\n(3) To be prepared to assure Heney that Ruef's evidence against his\r\naccomplices could be corroborated, and was sufficient to sustain a\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nRuef at first appeared to be well satisfied with the plan. He sent for a\r\nlist of San Francisco attorneys, and set himself enthusiastically to the\r\nwork of selecting a list of the names of attorneys to be submitted to\r\nHeney. But he failed to make a selection, urging all the time to Burns\r\nthat Heney accept Henry Ach. Ruef's insistence that he deal with Ach\r\nconvinced Heney that Ruef was not acting in good faith, and he refused\r\nto yield to Burns's urging that he give way to Ruef in this particular\r\nand accept Ach as Ruef's representative.[213]\r\n\r\nUnder Ruef's temporizing, negotiations dragged until April 2, the day\r\nthat, Ruef's technical obstructions in the main set aside, his trial was\r\nto be resumed before Judge Dunne.\r\n\r\nOn that day, a new actor appeared in the person of Dr. Jacob Nieto, a\r\nJewish Rabbi of some prominence in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nNieto, according to Burns's statement to Heney, asked the detective if\r\nhe had any objection to his (Nieto's) calling upon Ruef. Nieto stated\r\nfurther that he believed that he could get Ruef to confess, and\r\nvolunteered the theory that the \"higher-ups\" were endeavoring to make\r\nRuef a scapegoat for all the boodling that had been committed.\r\n\r\nBurns reported to Heney that he not only replied to Nieto that he had no\r\nobjection to Nieto's visiting Ruef, but would be glad to have the Rabbi\r\nendeavor to get Ruef to tell the truth.\r\n\r\nWhen Burns told Heney of this conversation, Heney did not show himself\r\nso well pleased with the arrangements as Burns might have expected. The\r\nprosecutor took occasion to warn Burns against Nieto. Heney had already\r\nhad unpleasant experience with Rabbi Nieto.[214] Nevertheless, Nieto\r\nvisited Ruef. Members of Ruef's family were called into consultation.\r\nConferences were held between Ach, Ruef and Burns. Heney states in his\r\naffidavit that he did not attend these meetings. Finally Burns brought\r\nHeney word that Ach and Ruef wanted citations to show that the District\r\nAttorney had authority to grant immunity. Heney sent back word that he\r\nwas confident that the District Attorney had no such power, but with\r\nthe further statement that if the terms of the immunity agreement were\r\nreasonable and in the interest of justice, that the Court, provided it\r\nhad confidence in the District Attorney, would unquestionably follow\r\nsuch recommendation as that official might make.\r\n\r\nBurns brought back word to Heney that Ruef and Ach continued to insist\r\nupon complete immunity.\r\n\r\nHeney sent back an ultimatum to the effect that Ruef must plead guilty\r\nto the extortion case then on trial before Judge Dunne[215] and take his\r\nchances with the sentence that would be given him; that if Ruef did\r\nthis, Heney was willing to arrange for complete immunity in all the\r\nother cases, provided Ruef showed to Heney's satisfaction that his\r\ntestimony could be sufficiently corroborated and would sustain a\r\nconviction of his accomplices other than Supervisors, in cases where\r\nmembers of the Board of Supervisors had been bribed.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the work of selecting a jury to try Ruef on the\r\nextortion charge was going on with the deadly certainty of the slide of\r\nthe knife of a guillotine. The second week of the examination of\r\nprospective jurors brought Dr. Nieto to Heney's office. Burns\r\naccompanied the Rabbi.\r\n\r\nNieto[216] described himself as no particular friend of Ruef. He\r\nexpressed the opinion that Ruef should be punished; that he should\r\nrestore his ill-gotten gains. Heney stated to Nieto his attitude toward\r\nRuef, as he had expressed it many times before. From that time on Dr.\r\nNieto was a frequent caller at Heney's office, always for the purpose of\r\ndiscussing the question of Ruef's confession. During all these meetings\r\nHeney did not depart a jot from his original position that the extortion\r\ncharge against Ruef should not be dismissed.\r\n\r\nLater on, a second Rabbi, Dr. Bernard M. Kaplan, joined Nieto in these\r\nvisits to Heney's office. Kaplan continued active in the negotiations to\r\nsecure immunity for the fallen boss.[217] Finally Nieto, Kaplan and Ach\r\nsent word to Heney and Langdon by Burns that they desired to meet the\r\nDistrict Attorney and his assistant at Heney's office to discuss the\r\nimmunity question. Heney and Langdon consented and the meeting was held\r\nin the latter part of April.\r\n\r\nAch insisted upon complete immunity, but admitted that he had advised\r\nRuef to take the best he could get.[218] Neither Langdon[219] nor Heney\r\nwould consent to complete immunity, nor to material change in the stand\r\nwhich Heney had taken. Ach wanted assurance that the Judges before whom\r\nthe bribery cases were pending would, on motion of the District\r\nAttorney, dismiss them as to Ruef, and suggested to Heney that he go to\r\nthe judges and get them to consent to the proposed agreement. To this\r\nHeney made emphatic refusal, stating that the utmost he would do would\r\nbe to go with Ach to Judges Dunne and Lawlor and ask each of them\r\nwhether he had confidence in him (Heney) and what the Judge's general\r\npractice was in relation to matters of this kind, generally, when they\r\ncame before his court.\r\n\r\nOther conferences[220] were held, at which Ach continued to urge\r\ncomplete immunity for Ruef, which finally brought out emphatic\r\nstatement from Heney that he did not trust Ruef and would enter into no\r\nagreement with him which did not leave it in the power of the District\r\nAttorney to send him to the penitentiary if at any time the District\r\nAttorney and himself concluded that during the progress of the matters\r\nRuef was acting in bad faith, or that the information which he might\r\ngive was not of sufficient importance to the people of the city and the\r\nState equitably to entitle him to go without punishment.\r\n\r\nHeney takes pains all through his affidavit to make it clear that he\r\ntreated with Nieto and Kaplan at all times upon the theory that they\r\nwere Ruef's special pleaders and special representatives, who believed\r\nthat Ruef was sure to be convicted upon as many of the felony bribery\r\ncharges as the District Attorney tried him on, and that he would go to\r\nthe penitentiary for a term of years equivalent to life.\r\n\r\nOn the night of April 21,[231] when the work of selecting a jury to try\r\nRuef was nearing completion, Ach, Kaplan and Nieto visited Heney's\r\noffice with assurance that Ruef had about concluded to accept Heney's\r\nterms. But, they explained, a new difficulty had come up. Rabbi Nieto\r\nwas to leave San Francisco the next morning for a trip to Europe.\r\nNeither he nor Dr. Kaplan was familiar with the practices of the courts,\r\nand while the judges would no doubt consider favorably any\r\nrecommendation which was made by Mr. Langdon or by Mr. Heney,\r\nnevertheless, the two Rabbis would like to hear from Judge Dunne and\r\nJudge Lawlor statement as to what the practice of each of these judges\r\nwas in that respect before they urged Ruef any further to accept the\r\nterms which had been offered him. As Dr. Nieto was to leave for Europe\r\nearly in the morning, they wanted to see the judges that night.\r\n\r\nHeney assured his visitors that owing to the lateness of the hour, he\r\nwas afraid it would be impossible for them to see the judges before\r\nmorning. But they insisted. Burns was finally sent out to find the\r\njudges if he could. He succeeded in locating Judge Lawlor at the\r\ntheater. Judge Lawlor at first refused to see Nieto and Heney that\r\nnight, stating that they could appear at his chambers the next morning.\r\nBut Burns explained that Nieto had to leave for Europe the next morning,\r\nadding that he was sure that both Nieto and Heney would consider it a\r\ngreat favor if the Judge would see them that night, as the matter was\r\nvery important. Lawlor finally consented to see them, but stated that he\r\nwould do so only at his chambers, if, as he understood it, Heney and\r\nNieto wanted to see him about his duties as judge. Burns took word back\r\nto Heney's office that they could go to Judge Lawlor's chambers, where\r\nthe Judge would go as soon as the theater was over.\r\n\r\nHeney, Kaplan and Nieto met Lawlor at his chambers. Heney went straight\r\nat the purpose of the meeting.\r\n\r\n\"Judge,\" Heney sets forth in his affidavit he said in substance, \"we\r\ncome up here tonight to ask you what the practice of your court is in\r\ncriminal cases in relation to recommendations which may be made by the\r\nDistrict Attorney?\"\r\n\r\nJudge Lawlor replied in effect that the District Attorney represents the\r\npublic in the prosecution of crime, and that under the law it was the\r\npractice for that official to submit to the court recommendations\r\nconcerning persons who turn state's evidence; that the law vests the\r\nauthority in the Court to determine all such recommendations and that it\r\nis proper for the District Attorney to make them; that such\r\nrecommendations should be carefully considered by the Court; and if they\r\nare in the interests of justice they should be followed, otherwise not.\r\nJudge Lawlor stated further that he would not consider or discuss any\r\ncause or case of any individual except upon a full hearing in open\r\ncourt, and that it would be determined alone upon what was so presented.\r\nFinal decision, he said, would in every case rest with the Court, and if\r\nthe application was in the interest of justice, it would be granted, but\r\nif not it would be denied.\r\n\r\nImmediately after having made this statement Judge Lawlor excused\r\nhimself and left the building.\r\n\r\nJudge Dunne, when finally found by Burns, objected as strongly as had\r\nJudge Lawlor to going to the courtroom that night, but finally yielded\r\nto the same representations as had been made to Judge Lawlor.\r\n\r\nAll parties at the meeting with Judge Dunne at the courtroom were agreed\r\nand the incident was quickly over.\r\n\r\nHeney asked the Judge, in effect, to state for the benefit of Nieto and\r\nKaplan the practice of his court in criminal matters in relation to any\r\nrecommendations which may be made by the District Attorney's office in\r\nthe interest of justice when the defendant becomes a witness on behalf\r\nof the State against his accomplices. Heney stated further that the two\r\nRabbis would also like to know whether or not Judge Dunne had confidence\r\nin District Attorney Langdon and himself.\r\n\r\nJudge Dunne replied in substance: \"I have confidence in you, Mr. Heney,\r\nand in the District Attorney, and while I have confidence in the\r\nDistrict Attorney, whenever a recommendation or suggestion is made by\r\nhim in a case pending in my department, it is my practice to entertain\r\nand be guided by it, provided, of course, it is in the interest or\r\nfurtherance of justice.\"\r\n\r\nKaplan wanted to know what the course would be should a man plead guilty\r\nand afterwards ask to change his plea.\r\n\r\n\"You have heard what I have said, gentlemen, as to my practice,\" replied\r\nJudge Dunne. \"Of course, in all cases of such recommendations, and which\r\nI insist shall always be made in open court, whenever the District\r\nAttorney fails to convince me that he is well advised, or that good and\r\nsufficient grounds exist for his motions, it must be remembered that the\r\nfinal determination must always rest with me. But, of course, I would\r\ngive great weight to any recommendation either you, Mr. Heney, or Mr.\r\nLangdon might make.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the courtroom Nieto, Kaplan and Burns went to Ruef, but Ruef still\r\ninsisted that he should not plead guilty to the extortion charge,\r\n\"backed and filled,\" as Burns expressed it.\r\n\r\nRuef sent word to Heney by Burns, asking an interview. But this Heney\r\nrefused to grant, bluntly stating that should he meet Ruef, Ruef would\r\nmisrepresent anything that he might say. Heney instructed Burns to tell\r\nRuef that he could accept the proposition that he had made to him or let\r\nit alone as he pleased, that no more time would be wasted on him; that\r\ntrial of the extortion charge would be pressed to conclusion and\r\nregardless of whether conviction were had or not, Ruef would be tried\r\nimmediately on one of the bribery charges.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the persistent Ruef got an interview with Heney. He\r\nsecured it in this way:\r\n\r\nAfter Heney had retired on the night of May 1st, Burns called him up on\r\nthe telephone, to state that if Heney would give Ruef a moment's\r\ninterview that Burns was confident that Ruef would accept Heney's\r\nproposition. Heney granted the hearing.\r\n\r\nRuef plead for complete immunity. He argued that for him to plead guilty\r\nto the extortion charge would weaken his testimony in the bribery cases.\r\nHe urged that public opinion would approve his release. He charged Heney\r\nwith being prejudiced against him.\r\n\r\nHeney listened to him patiently, but refused to consider any suggestion\r\nthat he alter the original proposition.\r\n\r\nBy this time ten jurors had been secured to try Ruef. Ruef begged for an\r\ninterview with Langdon. It was granted, with Heney and others present.\r\nThe same ground was gone over again; the same denials made. And then\r\nHeney bluntly told Ruef in substance: \"You must plead guilty in case No.\r\n305 and take your chances on the sentence which will be imposed in that\r\ncase. This is our ultimatum and you must agree to this before the first\r\nwitness is sworn in case No. 305, or we will withdraw our proposition\r\nand will never again renew it, or any other proposition looking to any\r\nsort of leniency or immunity for you.\"[222]\r\n\r\nThe day following, Burns brought word to Heney that Ruef had concluded\r\nto accept the Prosecution's proposition, and had begun his confession by\r\nreciting the particulars of the United Railroad's bribery. Burns recited\r\nwhat Ruef had told him. Burns's enthusiasm suffered a shock from Heney's\r\ncool analysis of Ruef's statement.[223]\r\n\r\nHeney pointed out that Ruef had made no revelation which the Prosecution\r\nhad not known before, and further that Ruef was certainly concealing\r\npart at least of what had occurred between him and General Ford. Heney\r\nwas now convinced of Ruef's treachery.[224] Ruef's future course tended\r\nto strengthen this conviction.\r\n\r\nHaving agreed to make full statement of his connection with the bribing\r\nof the Supervisors, Ruef haggled over the form of immunity contract. He\r\nendeavored to force upon the Prosecution a contract of his own drawing.\r\nFailing in that he tried to persuade Heney and Langdon to enter into a\r\nstipulation that he might withdraw his plea of guilty in the extortion\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nIn neither move was he successful. Heney refused to depart a jot from\r\nhis original proposition. Ruef finally accepted the immunity contract\r\nwhich Heney had submitted.[225]\r\n\r\nEven after the immunity contract had been signed, Ruef continued to urge\r\nBurns that he be not required to plead guilty. The prosecution was not\r\nsure what Ruef would do. The examination of jurors to try him went on.\r\nThe jury was completed on May 13,[226] and was sworn. But the actual\r\ntaking of testimony was delayed by Ruef demanding change of venue from\r\nJudge Dunne's court. This motion after the filing of numerous affidavits\r\nby both sides, was denied.\r\n\r\nHowever, Ruef's last motion delayed the taking of testimony for two days\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nUpon Judge Dunne's ruling the next move would have been the placing of\r\nwitnesses on the stand. But before this could be done, Ruef whispered to\r\nhis attorney, Ach. Ach arose and addressed the Court.\r\n\r\n\"I am requested by our client, your Honor,\" Ach said in substance, \"that\r\nit is his desire to have a conference with his counsel. I would like to\r\ndraw your Honor's attention to the fact that up to this time Mr. Ruef\r\nhas not had a single opportunity to confer with his counsel alone. If\r\nthe elisor, or the guards, were not in the same room they were quite\r\nclose by. I think, in view of this fact, that we might be granted an\r\nadjournment until say two o'clock of this afternoon so that Mr. Ruef may\r\nhave this privilege of conferring with us.\"\r\n\r\nHeney promptly denied Ach's statement. \"What Mr. Ach has stated is not a\r\nfact,\" said Heney. \"Mr. Ruef has always been granted privacy in his\r\nconference with counsel.\"\r\n\r\nOn Langdon's suggestion, a half hour's recess was granted to allow Ruef\r\nto confer with counsel. With his attorneys, Henry Ach, Samuel M.\r\nShortridge, Frank J. Murphy and Judge Fairall, Ruef went into Judge\r\nDunne's chambers for conference.\r\n\r\nOn their return to the courtroom, Ach and Shortridge, with Ruef's\r\nconsent, withdrew from the case on the ground that they could not agree\r\nwith Ruef as to the manner in which the case should be conducted.\r\nFairall and Murphy remained by their client.\r\n\r\nAnd then Ruef, the tears streaming down his face, addressed the Court.\r\nHe stated his intent to acknowledge whatever there may have been of\r\nwrong or mistake in his record, and pledged himself, so far as it lay in\r\nhis power to make it right.[227]\r\n\r\n\"I desire,\" concluded Ruef, \"to withdraw my plea of not guilty\r\nheretofore entered, and to enter the contrary plea, and at the proper\r\ntime submit to the Court further suggestions for its consideration.[228]\r\n\r\n\"If the defendant wishes to change his plea of 'not guilty' to\r\n'guilty,'\" said Heney, \"the prosecuting attorney will consent to the\r\ndischarge of the jury, as he requests, but we think the indictment\r\nshould first be re-read so that he may enter the plea as he wishes.\"\r\n\r\nThe indictment was read.\r\n\r\n\"What is your plea?\" asked Judge Dunne of the prisoner.\r\n\r\nAnd Ruef replied, \"Guilty.\"[229]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [207] The statements contained in this chapter are based on\r\n       affidavits filed in the case of The People vs. Patrick Calhoun\r\n       et al., No. 823. Many of the statements are qualified, and in\r\n       many instances denied, in affidavits filed by Ruef, his\r\n       friends, associates and attorneys, in the same proceedings.\r\n\r\n [208] In this connection, in discussing the difficulties in the way\r\n       of bringing criminals to trial, the San Francisco Chronicle,\r\n       in its issue of March 14, 1907, said:\r\n\r\n      \"The penal laws of California are admirable, and cover almost\r\n       every transaction deserving moral reprobation. The only reason\r\n       why all our people are not either virtuous or in jail is that\r\n       the same Legislatures which have so carefully defined crimes\r\n       and prescribed punishments have been still more careful to\r\n       enact codes of criminal procedure that nobody can be convicted\r\n       of any crime if he has the cash to pay for getting off. And\r\n       what the legislatures have failed to do in this direction the\r\n       courts have usually made good.\"\r\n\r\n [209] Four years later to a day, March 13, 1911, Ruef was taken to\r\n       the penitentiary at San Quentin to begin service of his\r\n       fourteen-year term for bribing a Supervisor.\r\n\r\n [210] As the impaneling of the Ruef jury proceeded, that Ruef's\r\n       nerve was breaking became apparent to all who saw him. The\r\n       Chronicle, in its issue of March 18, 1907, thus describes his\r\n       condition:\r\n\r\n       \"Ruef's nerve is breaking down. He is a prey to doubts and\r\n       fears which never troubled him in those days when he could see\r\n       his political henchmen every day and bolster up their\r\n       confidence in his ability to fight off the prosecution.\r\n       Reports reach his ears of confessions of guilt on the part of\r\n       some of his official puppets, of the sinister activities of\r\n       Burns and his agents and treachery on the part of those whom\r\n       he considered his most devoted adherents, and fill him with\r\n       alarm.\r\n\r\n       \"It was different when he could hold his Sunday evening caucus\r\n       with the members of the Board of Supervisors, and reassure them\r\n       that all would be well. He knows the men he used in his\r\n       political schemes and their weaknesses.\"\r\n\r\n [211] Heney, in instructing Burns as to his policy regarding Ruef,\r\n       took occasion to state to the detective his attitude toward\r\n       the broken boss. In an affidavit filed in the case of The\r\n       People vs. Calhoun et al., No. 823, Heney sets forth that he\r\n       told Burns: \"Ruef was not a mere accessory or tool in the\r\n       commission of these briberies. He is a man of extraordinary\r\n       brain power, keen intelligence, fine education, with the\r\n       choice of good environment, great power of persuasion over\r\n       men, dominating personality, great shrewdness and cunning,\r\n       coupled with a greedy and avaricious disposition. He has not\r\n       been led into the commission of these crimes through weakness,\r\n       but on the contrary has aided in the initiation of them and\r\n       has joined hands with the most vicious and depraved elements\r\n       in the city to secure unlawful protection for them in\r\n       conducting their resorts of vice, and has joined hands with\r\n       the special privilege seeking classes to place improper\r\n       burdens upon the people of this city by granting franchises to\r\n       public service corporations which ought never to have been\r\n       granted, and by fixing rates which may be charged by them in\r\n       excess of the amounts which such rates ought to be, and thus\r\n       indirectly robbing the poor people of this city of a large\r\n       part of their meagre earnings, and that to let Ruef go free of\r\n       all punishment under such circumstances would be a crime\r\n       against society.\"\r\n\r\n [212] Running through the affidavits which resulted from the\r\n       differences between the forces of the prosecution and the\r\n       defense concerning these negotiations, is a thread of\r\n       suggestion that individual members of the prosecution differed\r\n       as to the policy that should be followed toward Ruef. Burns,\r\n       the detective, leaned toward granting him complete immunity.\r\n       Heney was unalterably opposed to this course. Langdon, on the\r\n       whole, sided with Heney.\r\n\r\n [213] See Heney's affidavit in the matter of The People vs. Patrick\r\n       Calhoun et al., No. 823.\r\n\r\n [214] Nieto, according to Heney, had endeavored to make it appear\r\n       that race prejudice entered into the prosecution of Ruef.\r\n       Heney, in an affidavit filed in the case of The People vs.\r\n       Calhoun et al., No. 823, tells of Nieto's interference even\r\n       when the Oliver Grand Jury was being impaneled. Heney says:\r\n       \"During the latter part of October or the first week in\r\n       November, 1906, while said Grand Jury was being impaneled, Dr.\r\n       Jacob Nieto introduced himself to me in the court room of\r\n       Department No. 10, where I had noticed that he was a constant\r\n       attendant and close observer of the proceedings connected with\r\n       the impaneling of the Grand Jury.\r\n\r\n       \"Some days after he had introduced himself to me he stepped up\r\n       to me, just as court had adjourned and after I had been\r\n       examining some of the grand jurors as to their qualifications,\r\n       and said in substance:\r\n\r\n       \"'Mr. Heney, it seems to me that you discriminate somewhat\r\n       against the Jews in examining jurors, and I think that in your\r\n       position you ought to be more careful not to exhibit any\r\n       prejudice against a man on account of his religion.'\r\n\r\n       \"I asked what in particular I had done to cause him to\r\n       criticise my conduct in that way, and he referred to some\r\n       question which I had asked a grand juror, but which I cannot\r\n       now recollect. I then said to him in substance:\r\n\r\n       \"'Why, Doctor, you are supersensitive. Some of the best friends\r\n       I have in the world are Jews, and some of the best clients I\r\n       ever had in my life were Jews, and I have no prejudice against\r\n       any man merely on account of his religious belief. I am sorry\r\n       that you have so misapprehended the purpose and motives of my\r\n       questions to jurors.'\r\n\r\n       \"On a subsequent day, during the time the Grand Jury was being\r\n       impaneled, Dr. Nieto again approached me after an adjournment\r\n       of the court and again reproached me for having again shown\r\n       prejudice or discrimination against some grand juror of the\r\n       Jewish faith by the questions which I asked him * * * and I\r\n       said to him in substance, in a very emphatic tone of voice:\r\n       'Dr. Nieto, I have heretofore told you that I have no prejudice\r\n       against any man whatever on account of his religion. All I am\r\n       trying to do in this matter is to get fair grand jurors, and I\r\n       am just as willing to trust honest Jews as honest Christians,\r\n       but I want to make sure that a man is honest, whether a Jew or\r\n       Christian, and it looks to me as if you are trying to find some\r\n       excuse to line up in opposition to this prosecution. I do not\r\n       see why you need to seek for excuses if that is what you want\r\n       to do. I am conscious of my own singleness of purpose and\r\n       purity of purpose in examining grand jurors, and it is wholly\r\n       immaterial to me, therefore, what you or anybody else may think\r\n       of my method of questioning them.'\"\r\n\r\n       As a matter of fact Jews not only sat on the Oliver Grand Jury,\r\n       but were among the most earnest and effective in sifting the\r\n       graft scandal to the bottom. But that the false cry that Ruef\r\n       was persecuted because he was a Jew influenced many of his\r\n       fellow Jews in his favor is unquestionably true.\r\n\r\n [215] This case was numbered from the indictment, 305. Schmitz was\r\n       indicted jointly with Ruef in this indictment, and later was\r\n       convicted under it and sentenced to five years in the\r\n       penitentiary. See Chapter XVI. The testimony at the Schmitz\r\n       trial showed that Ruef had taken the extortion money from the\r\n       French-Restaurant keepers, after Schmitz had acted with him to\r\n       imperil the French-Restaurant keepers' liquor licenses, and\r\n       had given part of the proceeds of the enterprise to Schmitz.\r\n\r\n [216] In his affidavit, Heney quotes Rabbi Nieto as saying In\r\n       substance: \"I do not care to get publicly mixed up in the Ruef\r\n       case, because among other things, I am not a particular friend\r\n       of Ruef's, and am not interested in the matter as an\r\n       individual but only in the welfare of this community. I think\r\n       that Ruef has grievously sinned against this community and\r\n       that he can do a great deal to undo the wrongs which he has\r\n       committed and to clear up the situation, and I have told him\r\n       that it is his duty to himself and to his family and to the\r\n       city of his birth to do so. I want you to understand, Mr.\r\n       Heney, that I have not come here to ask you to let Ruef go\r\n       free and without punishment. I think he ought to be punished,\r\n       and I think he ought to give a large part of the money which\r\n       he obtained from these corporations to the city to improve its\r\n       streets. He ought to give $300,000 for that purpose, but Ruef\r\n       thinks more of money than he does of his family, or even of\r\n       his liberty, and I think he would rather go to the\r\n       penitentiary than give up any very large amount of it.\"\r\n\r\n [217] Heney, in his affidavit, makes the following statement of his\r\n       impression of Kaplan: \"Dr. Kaplan appeared to be far more\r\n       interested in finding out just what would be done to Ruef,\r\n       provided he plead guilty in the French Restaurant case than he\r\n       was in the moral issue which was involved in the discussion,\r\n       or in the beneficial effect which the testimony of Ruef might\r\n       have upon the deplorable situation then existing in San\r\n       Francisco on account of its municipal corruption.\r\n\r\n       \"This was evidenced more from his manner and form of\r\n       questioning than by anything which he said. I immediately\r\n       became convinced that he was influenced by no motive or\r\n       purpose other than that of getting Ruef off without any\r\n       punishment if possible; but I also formed the opinion that he\r\n       was honest and unsophisticated.\"\r\n\r\n [218] Heney, in his affidavit, states: \"During the conversation Ach\r\n       stated, in substance: 'You can't convict Ruef in this French\r\n       Restaurant case, but I realize that you are sure to convict\r\n       him in some of the bribery cases, and I think it is useless\r\n       for him to stand out and fight any longer, he had better take\r\n       the best he can get, and I have told him so. He insists,\r\n       however, that he ought not to be required to plead guilty in\r\n       the French Restaurant case, or to submit to any punishment.'\"\r\n\r\n [219] In the course of the interview, Langdon stated to Ach and the\r\n       two Rabbis that he had authorized Heney to conduct the\r\n       negotiations for him, but that he wanted it to be distinctly\r\n       understood by everybody that he had the final say in the\r\n       matter and would exercise it, and that no agreement could be\r\n       concluded without his personal sanction.\r\n\r\n [220] Heney, In his affidavit describing these meetings, states that\r\n       Ach, Kaplan and Nieto habitually came In the back way so they\r\n       would not be seen by newspaper reporters who at the time\r\n       frequented the front halls of the private residence in which\r\n       Heney, after the fire, had his offices. Ach, Heney states, was\r\n       desirous of not being known as party to the negotiations.\r\n       Heney in his affidavit says: \"In this same conversation (at\r\n       the first conference) Ach said in substance: 'I want everybody\r\n       here to agree that the fact that I participated in this\r\n       conference, or had anything to do with advising Ruef to turn\r\n       state's evidence, shall never be made known; it would\r\n       absolutely ruin my business if it became known. A lot of the\r\n       people whom Ruef will involve as accomplices are close friends\r\n       of clients of mine. Of course I do not know just whom he will\r\n       involve, but I do have a general idea. For instance, while he\r\n       has never told me so in so many words, I understand that he\r\n       will involve William F. Herrin. Now just to illustrate to you\r\n       how it would affect me in business if it was known that I\r\n       participated in urging Ruef to do this I will tell you that I\r\n       am attorney for one company, an oil company, that pays me ten\r\n       thousand dollars a year as a salary for attending to its\r\n       business, and Herrin is one of the directors of the company\r\n       and undoubtedly has sufficient influence with the other\r\n       directors to take this client away from me. This is only one\r\n       instance, and there are many others.'\"\r\n\r\n [221] See affidavits of Francis J. Heney and Judge William P. Lawlor\r\n       on file in the case of The People vs. Patrick Calhoun et al.,\r\n       No. 823.\r\n\r\n [222] See Heney's affidavit in the case of The People vs. Patrick\r\n       Calhoun et als., No. 823.\r\n\r\n [223] Ruef in this confession to Burns stated that he had received\r\n       $200,000 from General Tirey L. Ford, head of the United\r\n       Railroads law department. Of this amount, he said $50,000 he\r\n       had given to Schmitz and retained $50,000 for himself. Ruef,\r\n       five years later, in his story \"The Road I Traveled,\"\r\n       published in the San Francisco Bulletin, again stated that he\r\n       had received $200,000 from Ford, of which he gave to Schmitz\r\n       $50,000, to Gallagher his share for the Supervisors, and\r\n       retained $50,000 for himself. Gallagher received $85,000. This\r\n       leaves a balance of $15,000 which Mr. Ruef does not account\r\n       for.\r\n\r\n [224] It is significant to note in this connection that Heney did\r\n       not call Ruef as a witness before the Grand Jury in the United\r\n       Railroads cases until after the Grand Jury had found\r\n       indictments against the officials of that corporation. In the\r\n       opinion of the Grand Jurors, the testimony, exclusive of that\r\n       of Ruef, justified these indictments.\r\n\r\n [225] The immunity contract signed by Ruef and the District Attorney\r\n       will be found in full in the appendix.\r\n\r\n [226] At the completion of the Ruef Jury, the Chronicle, issue of\r\n       May 15, 1907, said:\r\n\r\n       \"The Ruef jury is complete and we are now in a way to learn\r\n       all the truth about the particular crime for which Ruef is\r\n       this time on trial, but which, compared with most other crimes\r\n       for which he has been indicted, is a mere peccadillo. That\r\n       Ruef got the money is proved, for he has confessed. His\r\n       defense, of course, will be that the French-Restaurant\r\n       proprietors voluntarily presented him with it. The state will\r\n       have to prove, in order to secure a conviction, that they did\r\n       not give the money voluntarily, but yielded it up under\r\n       threats which they believed it to be in his power to execute.\r\n       If the state fails to prove that Ruef will stand before the\r\n       community merely as a moral leper, loathsome to be sure, and\r\n       despicable almost beyond human conception, but yet not proved\r\n       guilty of that for which the law prescribes punishment in\r\n       state's prison. If proper proof cannot be made he must, of\r\n       course, be acquitted of this crime and at once put on trial\r\n       for another. Nothing is gained by society by the conviction\r\n       even of the most unmitigated scoundrel on insufficient\r\n       testimony. But when the proof is sufficient the salvation of\r\n       society demands punishment, and more particularly of\r\n       punishment of the rich criminal.\"\r\n\r\n [227] Ruef's statement was in full as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"If your honor please, with the permission of the court, I\r\n       desire to make a statement. I do so after only a short\r\n       consultation with my attorneys, to whom I have only within the\r\n       last half hour disclosed my determination, and against their\r\n       express protest. I take this occasion to thank them for their\r\n       services, fidelity and friendship. Notwithstanding the Court's\r\n       finding yesterday that this trial might safely be carried on\r\n       without serious injury to my health, physical or mental, I\r\n       wish to assure you that my personal condition is such that I\r\n       am at the present time absolutely unable to bear for two or\r\n       three months daily the strain of an actual trial of this case,\r\n       the constant, continual, nightly preparations therefor, the\r\n       necessary consultation and conversation with my attorneys in\r\n       regard thereto, to say nothing of other cares and\r\n       responsibilities.\r\n\r\n       \"Moreover, the strain of these proceedings upon those whom I\r\n       hold nearest and dearest of all on earth has been so grave and\r\n       severe that as a result of these prosecutions their health has\r\n       all been undermined, they are on the verge of immediate\r\n       collapse and their lives are indeed now actually in the\r\n       balance.\r\n\r\n       \"I have occupied a somewhat prominent position in this city of\r\n       my birth, in which I have lived all my life, where are all my\r\n       ties and interests, whence, when the time shall come, I hope to\r\n       pass into the eternal sleep. I have borne an honored name. In\r\n       my private and in my professional life there has been no stain.\r\n       In my public affiliations, until after the municipal campaign\r\n       of 1905 and the election of the present Board of Supervisors,\r\n       the abhorrent charges of the press to the contrary\r\n       notwithstanding, no action of mine ever gave just ground for\r\n       adverse criticism or deserved censure; but the assaults of the\r\n       press and its failure to credit honesty of purpose, a desire to\r\n       hold together a political organization which had been built up\r\n       with much effort, the means of otherwise holding them, did\r\n       after the election of this Board of Supervisors in a measure\r\n       influence me and the high ideals for which I had heretofore\r\n       striven.\r\n\r\n       \"During the past few weeks I have thought deeply and often of\r\n       this situation, its causes and conditions. To offer excuses now\r\n       would be folly. To make an effort at some reparation for the\r\n       public good is, however, more than possible; to assist in\r\n       making more difficult, if not impossible, the system which\r\n       dominates our public men and corrupts our politics will be a\r\n       welcome task.\r\n\r\n       \"I have decided that whatever energy or abilities I possess for\r\n       the future shall be devoted even in the humblest capacity to\r\n       restoring the ideals which have been lowered; shall, as soon as\r\n       opportunity be accorded, be re-enlisted on the side of good\r\n       citizenship and integrity. May it be allotted to me at some\r\n       time hereafter to have at least some small part in\r\n       re-establishment on a clear, sane basis, a plane of high civic\r\n       morality, just reciprocal relations between the constantly\r\n       struggling constituent element of our governmental and\r\n       industrial life.\r\n\r\n       \"In the meantime I begin by earnestness of purpose, a purpose\r\n       to make the greatest sacrifice which can befall a human being\r\n       of my disposition to make, to acknowledge whatever there may\r\n       have been of wrong or mistake and so far as may be within my\r\n       power to make it right.\r\n\r\n       \"I reached this final determination last night after careful\r\n       reflection and deliberation. Where duty calls I intend to\r\n       follow, whither hereafter the path of my life may lead and\r\n       however unpleasant and painful may be the result. I make this\r\n       statement so that the Court and the whole world may know at\r\n       least the motives which have guided me in the step I am about\r\n       to take.\r\n\r\n       \"As an earnest I have determined to make a beginning, I am not\r\n       guilty of the offense charged in this indictment. I ask now,\r\n       however, that this jury be dismissed from further consideration\r\n       of this case. I desire to withdraw my plea of not guilty\r\n       heretofore entered and to enter the contrary plea, and at the\r\n       proper time submit to the Court further suggestions for its\r\n       consideration.\"\r\n\r\n [228] The Chronicle, to its issue of May 16, said of Ruef's\r\n       confessions:\r\n\r\n       \"Abraham Ruef should have thought of his family before he\r\n       entered upon his career of crime. They are innocent and the\r\n       public need not, as indeed it cannot, withhold its sympathy\r\n       for them. The most terrible punishment which is inflicted on\r\n       such criminals is the distress which their crimes brings upon\r\n       the innocent persons who have been accustomed to respect and\r\n       honor them. But it is the inexorable doom which crime brings\r\n       upon itself.\r\n\r\n       \"For Ruef himself the only sympathy possible is that which one\r\n       might feel for a wolf which, having devastated the sheep fold,\r\n       has been pursued, brought to bay and, after a long fight,\r\n       finally disposed of. It is not a case in which the safety of\r\n       society permits leniency to be shown. Ruef has corrupted every\r\n       branch of the city government which he could get hold of and\r\n       brought the city almost to the verge of ruin. Seldom has a man\r\n       occupying an unofficial station in life been able to achieve\r\n       so much evil. It will be many a year before San Francisco can\r\n       outlive the shame which the man Ruef has brought upon her.\r\n\r\n       \"He has not been ingenuous even in his confession, for while\r\n       pleading guilty as charged, he professes to be not guilty of\r\n       this particular crime--meaning merely by that that he did not\r\n       extort the money by threats within the meaning of the law.\r\n       Witnesses, however, would have sworn that he did so. It is\r\n       unthinkable that such sums should have been paid him\r\n       voluntarily by the restaurant keepers. All that Ruef can mean\r\n       by his profession of 'innocence' while pleading guilty, is a\r\n       claim that he succeeded in terrifying the restaurant men into\r\n       submitting to blackmail without the use of words which the law\r\n       would construe as a threat. There is no moral difference\r\n       between what Ruef would claim that he did and the crime to\r\n       which he has pleaded guilty.\r\n\r\n       \"Ruef also shows his disingenuousness by attributing his\r\n       situation to 'the assaults of the press.' Doubtless he has been\r\n       assaulted by the press. But the press has accused him of\r\n       nothing but what he has confessed and intimated. What fault has\r\n       he to find with that? Shall the press remain silent while\r\n       thieves plunder a distressed city and rob it of its good name?\r\n       Ruef fought the forces of decency until he could fight no\r\n       longer. No man is strong enough to stand up against the wrath\r\n       of an outraged community. His physical collapse was inevitable\r\n       and the only mantle which charity can throw over him is that\r\n       his physical weakness broke down his mental faculties and\r\n       caused the self-contradictions in what is a virtual confession\r\n       of all that he has been charged with.\"\r\n\r\n [229] The position of the Prosecution was most difficult. Every\r\n       department of the municipal government, with the exception of\r\n       the District Attorney's office, was controlled by the corrupt\r\n       administration, of which Schmitz was the official head. The\r\n       necessity of dealing with Ruef, and the question of immunity\r\n       arose primarily and almost entirely, from the fact that there\r\n       was practically no evidence against Schmitz, except in the\r\n       French restaurant case, and that there was no evidence in that\r\n       case that Schmitz received any of the money which was\r\n       collected by Ruef. Consequently without Ruef's testimony no\r\n       conviction of Schmitz was possible at all except in the French\r\n       restaurant case, and in that case his conviction was not at\r\n       all certain. Union Labor party adherents were naturally\r\n       unwilling to believe Schmitz guilty until he had been so\r\n       proven. The big public service corporations and Herrin of the\r\n       Southern Pacific were all still in sympathy with him and ready\r\n       to back him for re-election. An election was approaching early\r\n       in November. The redemption of the city depended upon taking\r\n       its control away from Schmitz. The Police Commission and the\r\n       Board of Public Utilities were part of the corrupt and\r\n       discredited administration. During the rebuilding of San\r\n       Francisco it was of vital importance to have these two boards\r\n       honest. Hence the Prosecution felt justified in going to\r\n       unusual length to secure the additional testimony against\r\n       Schmitz, which ought to make his conviction certain in the\r\n       French restaurant case, and thus immediately depose him from\r\n       office and place the entire city government in the hands of\r\n       honest men. The new Mayor could appoint a new Board of\r\n       Supervisors, new Police Commission and new Board of Public\r\n       Works, as well as many other important officials; and such new\r\n       Mayor and Supervisors would be reasonably sure of re-election.\r\n       Agents of the Public Service corporations realized to the full\r\n       extent the importance of preventing the conviction of Schmitz,\r\n       and of forcing the prosecution to submit to the appointment of\r\n       a new Board of Supervisors before any conviction of Schmitz\r\n       could possibly be secure so that the new Board of Supervisors,\r\n       so selected through Schmitz by themselves, would have the\r\n       power of appointing the new Mayor in case Schmitz were\r\n       convicted. This new Mayor could appoint a new Police\r\n       Commission and it in turn a new Chief of Police, and the new\r\n       officials would be controlled by the same interests which\r\n       controlled the old ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n                    SCHMITZ CONVICTED OF EXTORTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne week after Ruef had plead guilty to the charge of extortion, his\r\nco-defendant, Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz, indicted jointly with Ruef, was\r\nbrought to trial, under indictment No. 305, to which Ruef had entered\r\nhis plea of guilty.\r\n\r\nHiram W. Johnson and J. J. Dwyer appeared with Heney and Langdon for the\r\nProsecution. The defense was represented by the firm of Campbell, Metson\r\n& Drew, assisted by John J. Barrett and Charles Fairall, all prominent\r\nat the San Francisco bar.\r\n\r\nThe preliminaries were not unlike those of the Ruef trial, which, at the\r\npoint where testimony would have been taken, was stopped by Ruef's plea\r\nof guilty. There were the same allegations of bias, the same attempts to\r\nsecure change of venue, the same appeals to the higher courts in habeas\r\ncorpus proceedings. But these moves availed Schmitz as little as they\r\nhad Ruef. Point by point the upper courts found against the indicted\r\nMayor; step by step he was dragged to proceedings before a trial jury.\r\n\r\nThe selection of the jury occupied two weeks. But with the swearing of\r\nthe twelfth juror, Schmitz did not stop proceedings with tearful\r\nconfession and a plea of guilty. Doggedly the troubled Mayor let the\r\ntrial go on. The Prosecution called its witnesses to the stand.\r\n\r\nOne by one Schmitz's former associates as well as the restaurant men\r\nfrom whom, through Ruef, he had received money, took the stand and told\r\nthe sordid story of the corruption of the Schmitz-Ruef administration.\r\n\r\nThe specific charge under which Schmitz was tried was that of extortion\r\nfrom Joseph Malfanti, Charles Kelb and William Lafrenz, proprietors of\r\nDelmonico's Restaurant, of $1,175. The sum was Delmonico's share of the\r\n$5,000 paid to Ruef in 1905, by the French-restaurant keepers to prevent\r\nthe liquor licenses, without which their establishments could not be\r\nsuccessfully conducted, being taken from them.\r\n\r\nThe testimony showed:\r\n\r\n(1) That Schmitz had used his power as Mayor over the Police\r\nCommissioners to compel them in the first instance, to withhold\r\nFrench-restaurant liquor licenses, and that later in the latter part of\r\nJanuary, 1905, he had exerted himself as actively and effectively to\r\nhave the licenses granted, even removing from office Police Commissioner\r\nHutton, who was standing out against the French restaurants.\r\n\r\n(2) That attorneys, appearing before the Police Commissioners, to\r\npresent the claims of the French-restaurant keepers for licenses, were\r\nunable to secure a hearing. One of these testified to having advised his\r\nclient, and other French-restaurant keepers that \"there is only one man\r\nwho can help you, and that is Mr. Ruef.\"\r\n\r\n(3) That a French-restaurant keeper who owed Ruef money, and at whose\r\nestablishment Ruef had his headquarters, approached his fellow\r\nFrench-restaurant keepers and told them that for $7,000 a year Ruef\r\nwould represent them and keep them secure in their business for two\r\nyears. The $7,000 demand was finally reduced to $5,000, $10,000 for the\r\ntwo years.\r\n\r\n(4) That the French-restaurant keepers raised $8,000 of the $10,000\r\ndemanded, and sent it to Ruef, $5,000 the first year and $3,000 the\r\nnext.\r\n\r\n(5) That Ruef refused to receive anything but currency, would give no\r\nreceipt for the money, and would deal with one man only.\r\n\r\n(6) That Ruef claimed to receive the money as a fee from the \"French\r\nRestaurant Keepers' Association,\" but that no such association existed\r\nin San Francisco.\r\n\r\n(7) That after the French-restaurant keepers had satisfied Ruef, Ruef\r\nappeared for them before the Police Commissioners and, after\r\nCommissioner Hutton had been removed from office by Mayor Schmitz,\r\nsecured for them their licenses.[230]\r\n\r\nHaving established its case thus far, the Prosecution rested.\r\n\r\nThe move was unlooked for. Ruef was known to have confessed; it had been\r\nconfidently expected that he would be placed on the stand to answer the\r\nquestion, in whatever form it could be forced into the record: Did you\r\ndivide the money which you received from the French-restaurant keepers\r\nwith Mayor Schmitz?\r\n\r\nBut Ruef was not put on the stand. The public marveled, but those behind\r\nthe scenes knew that Ruef was not the willing witness for the\r\nProsecution that the public thought.\r\n\r\nRuef had confessed to Heney that he had given half the $8,000 which he\r\nhad received from the French-restaurant keepers to Mayor Schmitz. But\r\nHeney, having trapped Ruef in deception, had very good reason for being\r\ndistrustful of him.\r\n\r\nRuef, forever seeking to justify himself, had told Heney that he had\r\nrefused to appear before the Police Commissioners on behalf of the\r\nFrench-restaurant keepers, until the San Francisco Bulletin had\r\nchallenged him to dare represent them, and claim the money he received\r\nfrom them was a fee. Ruef insisted that the Bulletin's challenge led him\r\nto take the case.\r\n\r\nIn this Heney trapped Ruef in his trickery.\r\n\r\nRuef's purported contract with the mythical \"French Restaurant Keepers'\r\nAssociation,\" under which the French restaurant keepers had paid him\r\n$8000, bore date of January 6. Ruef insisted to Heney that January 6 was\r\nthe true date upon which the contract was signed. The oral agreement had\r\nbeen made January 5. Heney then confronted Ruef with files of the\r\nBulletin which showed that the Bulletin had not mentioned Ruef as\r\nappearing on behalf of the French-restaurant keepers until January 7.\r\nThis was one day after Ruef had signed the purported contract with the\r\nmythical French Restaurant Keepers' Association.\r\n\r\nA stormy scene between Ruef and Heney followed this exposure.[231] Heney\r\ncharged Ruef with falsehood and deception, and declared the immunity\r\nagreement canceled. Heney then ordered Ruef from the room, and did not,\r\nuntil long after the Schmitz trial had closed, have conversation with\r\nhim again.\r\n\r\nWhen Schmitz's trial opened, District Attorney Langdon, Hiram Johnson,\r\nall the rest of Heney's associates, urged that Ruef be put on the stand,\r\ninsisting that the case would be greatly strengthened if it could be\r\nproved by Ruef that Schmitz had received half the extortion money.\r\n\r\nHeney conceded the strength of this contention, but held, on the other\r\nhand, that Ruef would lie so much about other things that he would do\r\nmore harm than good to the case. Personally, Heney insisted, he wanted\r\nnothing to do with him.\r\n\r\nThus, in making his opening statement to the jury in the Schmitz case,\r\nHeney refrained from stating that he expected to prove Schmitz received\r\nany part of the money which had been paid to Ruef.\r\n\r\nBut of the break between Heney and Ruef, the public knew nothing. San\r\nFrancisco looked to see Ruef put on the stand. When the Prosecution\r\nrested without calling this supposedly star witness, even the Defense\r\nwas taken by surprise and had to ask continuance until the following day\r\nbefore calling witnesses.\r\n\r\nSchmitz took the stand in his own behalf. He denied the statements which\r\nhis former Police Commissioners had made against him. The Mayor's story\r\nof denial was soon told. Heney, on cross-examination asked:\r\n\r\n\"Did Ruef pay you any part of the $5,000 that has been testified he\r\nreceived from the French restaurants?\" and Schmitz replied: \"I didn't\r\nknow that Mr. Ruef got any $5,000, nor did I receive any part of\r\nit.\"[232]\r\n\r\nAnd then, in detail, Schmitz denied that he had received any money from\r\nRuef, or had had any conversation with him regarding a \"fee\" which Ruef\r\nhad received from the French-restaurant keepers.\r\n\r\nIn rebuttal, Ruef was called to the stand.[233] \"Did you,\" questioned\r\nHeney, \"in January or February, 1905, in this City and County of San\r\nFrancisco, at the house of Eugene E. Schmitz, the defendant, at number\r\n2849 Fillmore street, give to Eugene E. Schmitz any money, and if so how\r\nmuch, and in what kind of money?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" answered Ruef, \"$2500 in currency.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you, then and there, tell him,\" pursued Heney, \"that it was his\r\nshare of the money you had received from the five French-restaurant\r\nkeepers?\" \"I didn't say to him,\" replied Ruef, \"that it was his share of\r\nthe money which I had received from the French restaurants. I did say to\r\nhim that I had received from the French restaurants the sum of $5,000,\r\nand that if he would accept half of it I should be glad to give it to\r\nhim. Thereupon I gave it to him.\"\r\n\r\nRuef testified further to paying Schmitz $1500 early in 1906, half of\r\nthe second payment made to him by the French-restaurant keepers.\r\n\r\nThe jurors before whom Mayor Schmitz was tried took one ballot only.\r\nThey found the defendant guilty of extortion as charged in the\r\nindictment.\r\n\r\nFollowing the verdict, Schmitz, who eighteen months before had, for the\r\nthird time been elected Mayor of San Francisco, was, as a convicted\r\nfelon, confined in the county jail.[234]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [230] For fuller discussion of this testimony see Chapter \"Ruef and\r\n       Schmitz Indicted.\"\r\n\r\n [231] \"You have not,\" said Heney to the trapped boss, \"told us all\r\n       the truth in the United Railroads case. You have not told us\r\n       all the truth in the case of the gas rate matter. You have not\r\n       told us all the truth in the Bay Cities Water deal. You have\r\n       not told us all the truth about the deal with Herrin in\r\n       relation to the delegates from this city to the Santa Cruz\r\n       convention. You have not told us all the truth in the\r\n       telephone franchise matter. You lied to us in the Parkside\r\n       matter, and I caught you at it before the Grand Jury. You\r\n       tried to protect Will Crocker in that matter and told Burns\r\n       before you went into the Grand Jury room that you had never\r\n       spoken to him on the subject. You swore to the same thing in\r\n       the Grand Jury room until you cunningly guessed from my\r\n       questions that Will Crocker himself had told the truth to the\r\n       Grand Jury, and that I was getting you in a bad hole; you then\r\n       suddenly pretended to just remember that you had held one\r\n       conversation with Will Crocker on the trolley franchise matter\r\n       at the Crocker National Bank that lasted a half an hour, and\r\n       that you had held another conversation on the street with Will\r\n       Crocker on the same subject at the corner of California and\r\n       Kearny streets, which lasted an hour. You had not forgotten\r\n       either of those talks, but you did not think Will Crocker\r\n       would testify to them and you wanted to curry favor with him\r\n       by thus making him think you wanted to protect him, and you\r\n       did it because he is rich and powerful. You wanted his\r\n       influence hereafter to help keep you out of trouble, because\r\n       you have no idea of acting in good faith with the prosecution.\r\n       I don't believe you ever acted in good faith with anybody in\r\n       your life, but you have over-reached yourself this time.\"--See\r\n       Affidavit of Francis J. Heney, in The People vs. Patrick\r\n       Calhoun et als., No. 823.\r\n\r\n [232] This answer came in the face of strong objection from\r\n       Schmitz's counsel. Mr. Campbell went so far as to direct\r\n       Schmitz not to answer. Mr. Barrett's objection was expressed\r\n       in a way that caused Judge Dunne to order him to his seat. The\r\n       several objections were overruled and the witness was directed\r\n       to answer the question.\r\n\r\n [233] Heney, in an affidavit filed in the case of The People vs.\r\n       Patrick Calhoun et al., No. 823, says of Ruef's appearance: \"I\r\n       did not at any time see or speak to Ruef, except when he was\r\n       on the witness stand, and then only from a distance and in\r\n       open court in the regular course of the trial and in the\r\n       performance of my duty as a prosecuting officer.\"\r\n\r\n [234] Where Schmitz spent the night of Thursday, June 13, the night\r\n       of his conviction, is a matter of dispute. Sheriff O'Neil\r\n       insists that he spent the night in jail. This has been denied.\r\n       The statement has been made, apparently on good authority,\r\n       that all of Friday following, Schmitz, accompanied by Dominic\r\n       Beban, a deputy sheriff and State Senator from San Francisco,\r\n       was about town in an automobile. But on Saturday, Judge Dunne\r\n       warned the sheriff that Schmitz was to be treated as any other\r\n       prisoner. After that day, pending his appeal to the higher\r\n       courts, Schmitz was confined in the county jail. Attorney J.\r\n       C. Campbell made a hard fight to keep his client out of jail.\r\n       Among other things, Mr. Campbell held that the Mayor had so\r\n       much official business to attend to that it was practically\r\n       necessary for him to be in his office all the time for the\r\n       next month.\r\n\r\n       Schmitz, under this conviction, was sentenced to serve five\r\n       years in the penitentiary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n                      SCHMITZ OUSTED FROM OFFICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe confession of the Supervisors to bribery had no sooner become known\r\nthan angling for control of the municipal government under its\r\nprospective reorganization began.[235]\r\n\r\nThe public-service corporation that had during the 1905 municipal\r\ncampaign contributed to the campaign funds of both the Union Labor party\r\nand the opposing \"Reform\" fusion organization, had no care as to who\r\nreorganized, or in what name the reorganization was accomplished, so\r\nlong as they continued in control. These corporations had larger\r\ninterest in public affairs than ever; there was prospect of their\r\nofficials being indicted for felonies. But so long as Schmitz continued\r\nto be Mayor, neither those who aimed to reorganize for the best\r\ninterests of San Francisco, nor those who were plotting to continue the\r\nold order with new men, in the interests of the corporations, could act.\r\nThe old order controlled Schmitz; the opposition, having whipped\r\nconfessions out of the Supervisors, controlled the board. Neither\r\nelement could undertake reorganization until in control of both Mayor's\r\noffice and Supervisors.\r\n\r\nThis deadlock was brought about by charter provisions empowering the\r\nBoard of Supervisors to fill vacancies occurring in the mayoralty\r\noffice, and providing that the Mayor shall fill vacancies on the Board\r\nof Supervisors.\r\n\r\nHad Mayor Schmitz resigned, the Supervisors, controlled by District\r\nAttorney Langdon, would have elected his successor. This would have\r\ngiven the Prosecution the Mayor as well as the Supervisors. On the other\r\nhand, had the Supervisors resigned, then Mayor Schmitz would have\r\nappointed as their successors men in accord with him and with his\r\npolicies. Schmitz could then have resigned and the Supervisors of his\r\nappointment would have named his successor. This would have permitted\r\nthe corrupt element to continue the old order in defiance of the\r\nProsecution. Thus, so long as Schmitz held the office of Mayor, the\r\nProsecution, laboring for good government, could not permit the\r\nbribe-taking Supervisors to resign. On the other hand, those who had\r\nfurnished the bribe money did not dare permit Schmitz to give up his\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nIn this astonishing situation, that bribe-givers might not gain the\r\nupper hand, it was necessary that the sixteen confessed bribe-taking\r\nSupervisors should continue in the offices which they had betrayed, so\r\nlong as Schmitz's power to appoint their successors continued.[236]\r\n\r\nThere were, too, further complications. The Prosecution could and did\r\nsecure the discharge from municipal positions of Ruef's satellites who\r\nheld their places under the Board of Supervisors. Thus, soon after the\r\nSupervisors had confessed, Charles Keane,[237] Clerk of the Board, was\r\nforced from his position. On the other hand, the old-time Schmitz-Ruef\r\nfollowers who owed their appointments to the Mayor, continued secure in\r\ntheir jobs. Thus, former Supervisor Duffey, appointed by Schmitz to head\r\nthe Board of Public Works, continued in that position, although involved\r\nby Gallagher in Gallagher's confession of the bribery transactions.\r\n\r\nThe Chief of Police held office under the appointment of the Board of\r\nPolice Commissioners. But Schmitz controlled the commissioners. The\r\nchief had been indicted with Schmitz and Ruef. The city was clamoring\r\nfor his removal. But in spite of protests, Schmitz's influence kept the\r\nindicted chief in his place at the head of the police department.[238]\r\n\r\nThe situation could not but cause confusion. To the average man on the\r\nstreet, the Supervisors had confessed to bribery. Why, then, were they\r\npermitted to remain an hour in office? Why were they not indicted,\r\nplaced on their defense and sent to the penitentiary?\r\n\r\nThe graft defense naturally took advantage of this sentiment.\r\n\"Government by the big stick,\" as the hold of the District Attorney's\r\noffice over the Supervisors was called, was condemned and ridiculed. One\r\nheard, however, little reference to the hold of the beneficiaries of the\r\nRuef administration upon the Mayor's office. From all sides the\r\nProsecution was importuned to oust the \"boodle Supervisors.\" But the\r\nfact that a \"boodle Mayor\" would then appoint their successors was not\r\ngiven such wide publicity.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the complications in the municipal government, due to the\r\nSchmitz faction's dogged resistance to the Prosecution, combined with\r\nthe unqualified yielding of the Supervisors and the partial confession\r\nof Ruef, San Francisco was in a condition of confusion and discord.\r\n\r\nAt the time Ruef entered his plea of guilty to extortion, a year had\r\npassed since the great fire of 1906. Thousands were still living in\r\nshacks erected in the ruins of the old city. The principal business\r\nstreets were littered with building materials. There had come the\r\ndepression following the activity of rehabilitation and the pouring into\r\nSan Francisco of millions of insurance money. Titles to real property\r\nwere confused if not in doubt, much of the records having been destroyed\r\nin the fire. Thousands found themselves forced into court to establish\r\ntheir titles. A little later, the community was to suffer a visitation\r\nof bubonic plague. There were many authentic plague cases and some\r\ndeaths. For months the city was in dread of quarantine.\r\n\r\nThere were labor disturbances which for weeks at a time paralyzed\r\nindustry. At one period between 7,000 and 10,000 iron-trades workers\r\nwere out on strike. At the time Schmitz was finally convicted of\r\nextortion the telephone girls had been on strike since May 3rd. This\r\nalone threw the complex organization of a modern city into extraordinary\r\nconfusion. The linemen struck. On June 21, telegraph operators in San\r\nFrancisco and Oakland left their keys.\r\n\r\nBut by far the most serious labor disturbance was the strike of the\r\nstreet-car conductors and motormen. For weeks the entire street-car\r\nsystem was paralyzed. The first attempt to move a car resulted in riot\r\nin which one man was killed outright and twenty-six wounded. A number of\r\nthe wounded died.\r\n\r\nPresident Calhoun of the United Railroads rejected all offers to\r\ncompromise, announcing his intention to break the Street Carmen's Union.\r\nHe succeeded; in the end the union was broken and scattered, but at\r\nfrightful cost to Mr. Calhoun's company and to San Francisco.\r\n\r\nDuring the strike of the carmen the city was filled with gunfighters and\r\nthugs admittedly in the employ of the United Railroads. Indeed, there\r\nwas no attempt made to disguise the fact that the United Railroads had\r\nbrought them into the city. Clashes between the two factions were of\r\ndaily occurrence.\r\n\r\nAside from horse-drawn vehicles which had been pressed into service,\r\nstreet transportation was, for a considerable period, practically at an\r\nend. The inability of the people to go from place to place paralyzed\r\nindustry and business. Merchants, hotel keepers, manufacturers, all\r\nsuffered. There were many failures. Citizens in all walks of life\r\nimplored Mr. Calhoun to arbitrate his difference with his men. He\r\nrefused absolutely.[239] Henry T. Scott, president of the Pacific States\r\nTelephone and Telegraph Company, as doggedly refused to submit to\r\narbitration the questions involved in the telephone girls' strike.\r\n\r\nThe police seemed utterly unable to deal with the situation, Governor\r\nGillett threatened to call out the militia, and companies at Los Angeles\r\nwere actually directed to be in readiness to enter San Francisco. But\r\nthis move was finally abandoned. And through it all, President Calhoun\r\nrefusing to arbitrate or to compromise, issued numerous\r\nproclamations[240] in which he intimated that the Graft Prosecution had\r\nbrought on the trouble which confronted San Francisco. The Prosecution's\r\nobject, Mr. Calhoun held, was to injure him and his railroad company. In\r\nthis connection, it may be said, that during the searching investigation\r\nof the graft trials, not one word of testimony was produced to indicate\r\nbasis for Mr. Calhoun's insinuations and open charges that the carmen's\r\nstrike was part of a plot to injure him and his company.[241] On the\r\ncontrary, the strike might have been averted had the United Railroads\r\nadopted a more tactful policy in dealing with its men. And, in addition\r\nto this, a more conciliatory attitude on the part of President Calhoun\r\nwould, during the progress of the strike, have brought it to a close at\r\nany time. The fact remains, too, that during the 1907 municipal\r\ncampaign, which opened even while the United Railroads was crushing the\r\ncarmen's union, the support of the United Railroads went to the Union\r\nLabor party candidate for District Attorney. Heading the Union Labor\r\nparty ticket was P. H. McCarthy, one of the strongest opponents of the\r\nGraft Prosecution, and at the same time ardent backer of the striking\r\ncarmen.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of the United Railroads to crush the carmen's union, while\r\nat the same time exerting itself to elect the Union Labor party\r\ncandidate for District Attorney, indicates the confusion that existed in\r\nSan Francisco following the confessions of the Supervisors and the\r\nrevelations made by Ruef. And the efforts of the various factions to\r\nseize the municipal government increased this confusion materially.\r\n\r\nThe day following Ruef's confession, a committee of businessmen,\r\nrepresenting the Merchants' Association, the Board of Trade, the Chamber\r\nof Commerce, the Manufacturers' and Producers' Association and the\r\nMerchants' Exchange waited upon Spreckels and Heney to enlist the\r\nco-operation of the Prosecution in restoring normal conditions. The\r\ncommittee--called the Committee of Seven because of its numbers--[242]\r\nalready had the endorsement of Mayor Schmitz. The Chronicle, which\r\nacted from the start in the capacity of special pleader for this\r\ncommittee, announced in startling headlines in its issue of May 18, that\r\n\"Mayor Schmitz practically turns reins of government over to citizens.\r\nCommittee of Seven may run this city.\"[243]\r\n\r\n\"With the exception of the administration of merely routine affairs,\"\r\nsaid the Chronicle of that date, \"the committee, by Mayor Schmitz's\r\nwritten agreement, is to all intents and purposes, the Mayor of San\r\nFrancisco.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor James N. Gillett[244] was reported to be heartily in accord\r\nwith the committee's purposes. Finally, in an editorial article, the\r\nChronicle announced that \"the public looks to this committee to restore\r\nthe good name of the city, and to the prosecuting authorities to stand\r\nsolidly behind them while they do it.\"\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the Chronicle's insistence, the public gave no evidence\r\nof spontaneous outburst in favor of the committee. Instead, there was a\r\ngeneral turning to the leaders of the Prosecution to note their\r\nattitude. The Prosecution gave no evidence of enthusiastic support;\r\nquite the contrary. \"The District Attorney,\" announced Langdon, \"will\r\nnot act with any committee that is named by Mayor Schmitz to take charge\r\nof the government of San Francisco.\"\r\n\r\nAfter several conferences with the committee, Rudolph Spreckels refused\r\nto join with it on the ground that it had placed itself in a position\r\n\"to directly or indirectly accomplish results very much desired by\r\nCalhoun, Herrin and the coterie who are inimical to the Prosecution.\"\r\nMr. Spreckels also expressed his belief that a majority of the committee\r\nwere sincere men who went on the committee with proper motives, but,\r\nSpreckels suggested, \"if this committee really has its origin in an\r\nhonest motive, I do not see why it cannot act on its own volition. I do\r\nnot see the necessity of this committee demanding that I co-operate with\r\nit. If its members want to have a change in the municipal offices and\r\nthe members of the various municipal commissions, let them go ahead and\r\noutline their own programme. I have no desire to dictate who shall\r\nconstitute the membership of the various city offices. I started out in\r\nthis graft prosecution to bring all guilty municipal officials to the\r\nbar of justice and have them punished. That is my single motive. I have\r\nno ulterior designs in this matter regardless of whatever anyone may\r\nsay to the contrary.\"[245]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the Chronicle's statement that the public looked to the\r\nProsecution to stand solidly behind the committee, and the protestations\r\nof Governor Gillett, the public was content to accept the judgment of\r\nMr. Langdon, Mr. Spreckels and Mr. Heney as final. Without popular\r\ndemand for it, there was nothing for the committee to do but resign. And\r\nit did resign.[246]\r\n\r\nThe resignation of the Committee of Seven brought from Governor Gillett\r\na statement urging the appointment of \"a strong governing body to take\r\ncharge of affairs.\"[247] Acting upon the Governor's suggested plan, the\r\nfive commercial bodies decided upon the appointment of a committee of\r\nseventy-five, or, as the Chronicle, mouthpiece for the advocates of this\r\ncourse, put it, \"Seventy-five prominent citizens are to be appointed to\r\nrestore order.\" The Chronicle went on to say that \"It is understood that\r\nMayor Schmitz is ready to agree to act in accordance with the\r\nrecommendations of the new committee as he did when the Committee of\r\nSeven was formed. He would be glad, it is believed, to have the\r\nassistance of such a body of men in meeting some of the conditions which\r\nhe has to face.\"[248]\r\n\r\nAt the time (May 29) of the publication of the Chronicle's belief that\r\nMayor Schmitz would be glad to have the assistance of such a body of men\r\nas had been proposed, the Mayor's trial was drawing to its close. A\r\nfortnight later he was convicted of one of the gravest felonies that can\r\nbe charged against an executive. Mayor Schmitz's conviction brought\r\ncomplete change in the situation. It made possible the ousting of the\r\nentire corrupt administration. In the ousting, the commercial bodies, as\r\nwell as the representative labor union organizations, were given\r\nopportunity to co-operate. The refusal of the majority of them to\r\nparticipate threw the obligation upon the District Attorney's office.\r\n\r\nWhen the Jury returned its verdict finding Mayor Schmitz guilty of\r\nfelony, District Attorney Langdon found himself in an extraordinary\r\nposition. Upon him, as District Attorney, fell the responsibility of\r\nnaming the chief executive of San Francisco to succeed the discredited\r\nMayor.\r\n\r\nThere was no question about a vacancy existing in the Mayor's office.\r\nUnder the California laws, a vacancy in office exists upon conviction of\r\nthe incumbent of felony. The courts had held repeatedly that a jury's\r\nverdict of guilty in a felony case carries conviction.\r\n\r\nA vacancy, therefore, existed in the Mayor's office. Under the municipal\r\ncharter the Supervisors alone were empowered to fill it. But sixteen of\r\nthe Supervisors, having confessed to felonies, were taking no steps\r\nwithout the approval of the District Attorney. They would name for\r\nMayor, him whom the District Attorney approved and no other. Naturally,\r\nLangdon consulted those associated with him in the Graft Prosecution. No\r\nbetter earnest of the sincerity and disinterestedness of Langdon and\r\nthose who were assisting him is furnished than in this crisis. They had\r\nit within their power to select first Mayor and then Supervisors who\r\nwould be utterly subservient to them. Instead, they proposed a plan by\r\nwhich representative associations were given opportunity to reorganize\r\nthe municipal government by naming Mayor Schmitz's successor.\r\n\r\nNor was there any hasty action. The office of Mayor was not declared\r\nvacant until after Schmitz had been sentenced to the penitentiary. But\r\nSchmitz was in the county jail and incompetent to act. It was of\r\nimmediate necessity that a temporary successor be substituted. Until\r\nthis were done, San Francisco would be without a chief executive. To\r\nmeet the emergency, the Supervisors named Supervisor Gallagher to be\r\nacting Mayor.[249]\r\n\r\nAfter the sentencing of Schmitz the rapidly developing situation made it\r\nnecessary that the convicted official's office be declared vacant and\r\nhis successor appointed. But the successor had not been named, nor had\r\nplans for the change in administration been formulated.[250] In this\r\nfurther emergency, it was decided to name one of the Supervisors to be\r\nMayor to serve until a permanent successor of Mayor Schmitz could be\r\nnamed. The unhappy Boxton[251] was decided upon. The Supervisors, by\r\nresolution, definitely declared the office of Mayor vacant and elected\r\nSupervisor Boxton to be Mayor.\r\n\r\nOn the day that Boxton was named Mayor of San Francisco, District\r\nAttorney Langdon made public a plan for a convention to select a Mayor\r\nto serve until the successor of Mayor Schmitz could be elected and\r\nqualified. Mr. Langdon proposed that the convention should be made up of\r\nthirty members, fifteen to be appointed by organized labor and fifteen\r\nby the organized commercial bodies. On the side of Labor were\r\napportioned eight delegates to the Labor Council and seven to the\r\nBuilding Trades Council. The five commercial bodies, the Chamber of\r\nCommerce, Merchants' Association, Board of Trade, Real Estate Board and\r\nMerchants' Exchange, were allowed three delegates each. That the\r\nconvention might proceed in its choice unhampered, the District Attorney\r\npledged that he and his associates would wholly refrain from\r\nparticipation after the convention had assembled.[252]\r\n\r\nBut this did not suit the several factions at all. Admittedly, the\r\nProsecution could name the Mayor. Each faction wanted its man named, and\r\nwhile there remained a chance for its man to be named, did not care to\r\nsee the extraordinary power in the hands of the District Attorney\r\ndelegated to the uncertainties of a convention.\r\n\r\nIn the scramble for advantage, the self-control and self-forgetting\r\nattitude of the members of the Prosecution, instead of exciting\r\nadmiration, was condemned. The Examiner, referring to Langdon's\r\nassociates, for example, announced: \"Their failure to agree on anyone\r\nhas led to some alarm for fear their divergent political ambitions are\r\nmaking each of them endeavor to secure a place for his personal puppet.\"\r\nHad the Prosecution named the Examiner's \"personal puppet,\" this\r\nparticular source of criticism would undoubtedly have been silenced and\r\nthe Examiner's vilification and abuse of the Prosecution during the\r\nyears that followed averted. What is true of the Examiner in this regard\r\nis true of the other institutions and interests which, in this crisis of\r\nthe city's history, were clamoring for \"recognition.\"[253] District\r\nAttorney Langdon's plan, on the whole, was not received in the spirit in\r\nwhich it was offered.\r\n\r\nThe Building Trades Council, under the influence of P. H. McCarthy and\r\nO. A. Tveitmoe, promptly rejected the District Attorney's proposal and\r\nrefused to name delegates.[254] This action influenced the Labor\r\nCouncil, which, on the ground that in the absence of delegates from the\r\nBuilding Trades Council the Labor Council representatives might be\r\noutvoted, refused to participate.\r\n\r\nOf the five commercial bodies, the Real Estate Board alone promptly\r\naccepted the District Attorney's invitation. The board named its three\r\ndelegates and so notified the District Attorney.\r\n\r\nThe Merchants' Exchange demanded that the number of delegates be\r\nincreased from thirty to forty-five by the addition of fifteen\r\nprofessional men, and proposed that the convention name a new Board of\r\nSupervisors as well as Mayor.[255]\r\n\r\nThe Board of Trade refused to co-operate unless the delegates be\r\nincreased in number by the addition of \"professional men and others.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chamber of Commerce and the Merchants' Association finally accepted,\r\nbut stipulated that a two-thirds vote of the thirty delegates should be\r\nrequired for a choice.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the several organizations to join in the selection of a\r\nMayor, made it necessary for Langdon himself to proceed with the\r\nreorganization. All that Langdon and his associates required was that\r\nthe new executive should be independent of political control and free of\r\nthe influence of those public-service corporations that had been trapped\r\nin bribe-giving. It was also the aim of the Prosecutor to name as Mayor\r\none whose standing was such that none could be so unfair as to charge\r\nhim with being in the slightest degree under the influence of the\r\nProsecution.\r\n\r\nLangdon and his associates agreed that Dr. John Gallwey was independent\r\nof corrupting influences and to Dr. Gallwey the appointment was\r\noffered. But Dr. Gallwey declined to accept the responsibilities of the\r\nMayor's office on the ground that he could not afford to devote his time\r\nto the duties of the office to the extent that would be required in\r\norder to conduct it properly, and on the further ground that he could be\r\nof more service to humanity in the practice of medicine than in the\r\ndischarge of the duties of Mayor.\r\n\r\nThe place was then offered to Ralph Harrison, a former member of the\r\nSupreme Bench. But Judge Harrison declined on the ground that he thought\r\nthe duties of the office, under the conditions existing[256] would be\r\ntoo onerous for him to undertake at his time of life.\r\n\r\nDr. Edward R. Taylor,[257] dean of the Hastings College of Law, was then\r\nconsulted. Dr. Taylor agreed to accept the position. In tendering Dr.\r\nTaylor the mayoralty, the Prosecution left him entirely free to conduct\r\nthe office according to his own judgment. He was assured that no one\r\nconnected with the Prosecution would expect or ask him to be guided or\r\ncontrolled or influenced in any way by all or any of them.\r\n\r\nBoxton, after Taylor had agreed to serve, resigned his office. The\r\nSupervisors then elected Dr. Taylor to fill the vacancy.[258]\r\n\r\nThe next step in the reorganization of the municipal government was the\r\nresignation of the sixteen Supervisors who had confessed to bribery and\r\nthe appointment of their successors. When Mayor Taylor[259] had found\r\nsixteen representative citizens willing to serve, the change was made.\r\nOne by one the discredited officials resigned their positions. After\r\neach resignation had been accepted Mayor Taylor named the resigning\r\nmember's successor.[260]\r\n\r\nThe scene was as painful as it was extraordinary. When it was over, the\r\nSchmitz-Ruef administration, so far as the legislative and executive\r\nbranches were concerned, had passed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [235] As early as March 20, 1907, two days after the Supervisors\r\n       gave their confession to the Grand Jury, The Chronicle touched\r\n       upon the growing resistance to the prosecution. It said:\r\n\r\n       \"In the leading political clubs there is talk of Governor\r\n       Gillett removing Mayor Schmitz and appointing a successor.\r\n       This is in the line of gossip, however, for there is a legal\r\n       question involved, the framers of the municipal Charter having\r\n       provided no means for the removal of the head of the municipal\r\n       government should he be found criminally derelict. There is\r\n       also some talk of Schmitz resigning if Heney will vaccinate\r\n       him and render him immune from punishment for his offenses, as\r\n       he is said to have done with the Supervisors. Another angle of\r\n       the gossip in this regard is that the Mayor will appoint a\r\n       Board of Supervisors picked by prominent merchants and\r\n       professional men who have organized for the purpose of\r\n       redeeming San Francisco from the toils of the grafters.\"\r\n\r\n [236] The Chronicle, in its issue of April 3, in discussing this\r\n       phase of the situation, said:\r\n\r\n       \"The spectacle of the entire legislative body of a city\r\n       confessing to the acceptance of great bribes is astonishing.\r\n       Their continuance in office and consultation with the good\r\n       citizens as to the best methods of restoring good government\r\n       is unique. In many parts of the country there is outspoken\r\n       disapproval of the course which is being taken, and loud\r\n       declarations that if there were any good citizenship in San\r\n       Francisco the confessed rogues would be driven out of office\r\n       and hustled into the penitentiary. It is declared that in\r\n       granting 'immunity' to these Supervisors the city is again\r\n       disgraced. Of course, all this is absurd. In the first place,\r\n       there is no evidence and little probability that immunity has\r\n       been promised to anybody. Secondly, if the present Supervisors\r\n       should resign Schmitz would promptly fill their places with\r\n       men whom he can more implicitly trust but who would not be\r\n       subject to indictment or in any way amenable to decent\r\n       influence. As for Schmitz, he will remain Mayor until he is\r\n       convicted of crime. The public does not know how that\r\n       conviction is to be got. It is supposed that some Supervisor\r\n       can give part of the necessary evidence, but no Supervisor can\r\n       be compelled to give any evidence at all, and they probably\r\n       would give none, if driven out. They are not obliged to\r\n       criminate themselves. As for Schmitz, he is still defiant. He\r\n       apparently does not believe that under the legal rules of\r\n       evidence he can be convicted of what he evidently did. The\r\n       journals which contrast our slow movement with the swift\r\n       punishment which befell briber and bribed when the Broadway\r\n       street railroad franchise was purchased doubtless do not\r\n       understand that the laws and court procedure in California are\r\n       designed not to convict criminals, but to aid their escape\r\n       from justice, and that when Jake Sharp bought the New York\r\n       Aldermen he did not also buy the authority which filled\r\n       vacancies in the Board. As the situation in this city is\r\n       unique, so, also, must be our methods of dealing with it. It\r\n       may be that every Supervisor ought to be promptly indicted but\r\n       it is certain that that is the one thing most ardently desired\r\n       by the innumerable company of grafters outside the board. And\r\n       it may not be but to help them.\"\r\n\r\n [237] Keane had two champions on the board, however. Supervisors J.\r\n       J. O'Neil and O. A. Tveitmoe. They resisted Keane's discharge,\r\n       denouncing it as unwarranted and cowardly. Mayor Schmitz\r\n       vetoed the resolution removing Keane. The Supervisors,\r\n       however, adopted the resolution over the Mayor's veto.\r\n\r\n [238] The San Francisco Call, in its issue of June 10, 1907, said of\r\n       Schmitz's continued hold on the Police Department:\r\n\r\n       \"The Call has never attached much importance to the well meant\r\n       efforts of the various citizens' committees to persuade Mayor\r\n       Schmitz to reorganize the police force and the governing\r\n       commission of that body. It is easy to understand that Schmitz\r\n       might engage in some such transaction or bargain if he could\r\n       be shown his own advantage therein, but that he would\r\n       surrender control of his most valuable personal asset at this\r\n       time or, indeed at any other time, was scarcely conceivable in\r\n       view of the character of the man. This is said advisedly. It\r\n       is notorious that Schmitz all through his long session in\r\n       office has treated his control of the police not as a public\r\n       trust for the common good, but as so much personal property to\r\n       be used to the limit for his private advantage. Therefore,\r\n       when Schmitz, in the first instance, gave a committee some\r\n       sort of pledge that he would comply with its desire or\r\n       requests, there was a very natural suspicion that the terms of\r\n       the bargain as a whole had not been disclosed. There was the\r\n       insistent inquiry, 'What does Schmitz get by the bargain?'\r\n\r\n       \"That question has never been answered from the inside and\r\n       probably will not be answered, but the committee very shortly\r\n       quit in disgust, realizing, doubtless, that Schmitz wanted\r\n       something it could not grant as a consideration for his\r\n       abandonment of power.\r\n\r\n       \"A second committee that took up the work now finds that\r\n       Schmitz is deaf to its requests for a reorganization of the\r\n       police force. The lack of discipline in that body has become a\r\n       public scandal. At its head is seen a man under indictment for\r\n       felony, the associate of criminals and accused of tampering\r\n       with veniremen called to try Schmitz--an accusation whose truth\r\n       he admits. Governor Gillett has expressed the common knowledge\r\n       that the Chief of Police is incompetent. He might have used a\r\n       harsher word. But Dinan suits Schmitz. He is the ready and\r\n       unscrupulous tool. An honest man in the same place would be of\r\n       no use to Schmitz!\"\r\n\r\n [239] When, through the good offices of a committee of citizens, the\r\n       difficulties of the iron trades were finally adjusted, The\r\n       Call took occasion to urge an ending of the stiff-necked\r\n       policy which kept other employers and employees apart.\r\n\r\n       \"In the car strike,\" said The Call in its issue of June 1st,\r\n       \"in the telephone strike, in the laundry strike, there is\r\n       nothing that cannot be disposed of by the same method and\r\n       through the same agency as those that ended the iron trades\r\n       controversy. There is no reason why all those disputes cannot\r\n       be settled reasonably. The conciliation committee stands for\r\n       public opinion. It voices the demand of the public for peace.\r\n       No employer can afford to refuse its offices, nor can any\r\n       representative of the employed afford to decline its offers of\r\n       mediation. And if this committee, standing as it does for\r\n       public opinion, could speak with conviction to the iron\r\n       masters and their striking workmen, it should be able to deal\r\n       even more effectively with the car strike and with the\r\n       telephone strike. Those disputes concern public utilities.\r\n       Street-cars are run and telephones are operated under and by\r\n       virtue of grants and privileges made by the people, wherefore\r\n       the people have the right to intervene when the grantees of\r\n       those privileges are at war with their employes. The people\r\n       have the right, at least, to mediate for peace. Mr. Cornelius\r\n       and Mr. Calhoun, Mr. Scott and the leader of the telephone\r\n       strikers may refuse to listen to the pacific overtures of the\r\n       conciliation committee, but if they do they must understand\r\n       that the price of refusal is the loss of public sympathy and\r\n       support--elements without which ultimate victory is\r\n       impossible.\r\n\r\n       \"San Francisco has had about enough industrial warfare. The\r\n       city wants peace, lasting peace. No sane man wants a fight to a\r\n       finish between labor and capital, or if he does he is San\r\n       Francisco's enemy. The adjustment of the iron-workers' strike\r\n       is a hopeful sign. It points the way to an end of all\r\n       bitterness and contention. It augurs an early return to the\r\n       harmonious relations of those who earn and those who pay wages,\r\n       relations which are essential to the progress and prosperity of\r\n       any community. It is the best news of this stormy, stressful\r\n       month.\"\r\n\r\n [240] The following, issued on May 17, is a fair sample of the\r\n       statements which Mr. Calhoun gave out during the period of\r\n       confusion in San Francisco, in the spring and summer of 1907:\r\n\r\n       \"To the American People--The newspapers of this city published\r\n       yesterday afternoon and this morning contain sensational\r\n       statements purporting to give the testimony of Mr. Abraham\r\n       Ruef before the Grand Jury yesterday afternoon. It is alleged\r\n       that he confessed that the United Railroads, through some of\r\n       its officials, bribed the Supervisors to grant the permit for\r\n       the overhead trolley over certain of its roads. I do not know\r\n       if Mr. Ruef made any such statements. If he did, they are\r\n       untrue. I repeat with renewed emphasis my former declaration\r\n       that no official of this company ever bribed any one,\r\n       authorized Mr. Ruef or any one else to bribe anybody, knew of\r\n       any bribery, or approved of any bribery.\r\n\r\n       \"I charge the Prosecution with having prostituted the great\r\n       office of the District Attorney to further the plans of private\r\n       malice in the interest of a man who organized the Municipal\r\n       Street Railways of San Francisco on the 17th day of April,\r\n       1906, the day before the earthquake and fire with a capital\r\n       stock of $14,000,000, of which $4,500,000 were subscribed for\r\n       as follows: Claus Spreckels subscribed $1,900,000, James D.\r\n       Phelan subscribed $1,000,000, George Whittell subscribed\r\n       $500,000, Rudolph Spreckels subscribed $1,000,000, Charles S.\r\n       Wheeler subscribed $100,000. Ten per cent of the amount\r\n       subscribed, or $450,000, was paid in cash, as shown by the\r\n       affidavit of the treasurer of the company, James K. Moffitt,\r\n       duly filed in the County Clerk's office.\r\n\r\n       \"I charge that, in furtherance of the plans of the private\r\n       prosecutor to assure evidence that would involve the United\r\n       Railroads, the District Attorney has been willing to purchase\r\n       testimony with immunity contracts, purporting to grant immunity\r\n       to self-confessed criminals, which contracts I am informed were\r\n       placed in escrow with the private prosecutor, and through which\r\n       he controls a majority of the Board of Supervisors who, as a\r\n       member of the prosecution has declared, are 'dogs' to do his\r\n       bidding.\r\n\r\n       \"I charge that the District Attorney was in consultation with\r\n       the members of the self-confessed criminals on the Board of\r\n       Supervisors in regard to the passage of the resolution holding\r\n       up the Geary street railroad company, providing for the\r\n       forfeiture of its license, unless it yielded to the demands of\r\n       its striking employes.\r\n\r\n       \"I charge that while the best element in this community was\r\n       seeking to preserve law and order the District Attorney was in\r\n       secret conference with self-confessed criminals, giving aid and\r\n       comfort to the strikers. Shall his great office be prostituted\r\n       to the support of lawlessness?\r\n\r\n       \"The officials of this company are ready to meet their enemies\r\n       in the open, and before they are through, they expect to show\r\n       to the whole country the infamy of the methods of the\r\n       prosecution, the baseness of the motives of the private\r\n       prosecutor, his readiness to grant immunity to self-confessed\r\n       criminals, and the willingness of the prosecution to aid the\r\n       strikers, even if it involved this community in disorder and\r\n       bloodshed, provided it furthered the private prosecutor's\r\n       personal ends.\r\n\r\n       \"The organization of the Municipal Street Railways of San\r\n       Francisco, the attacks upon the officials of the United\r\n       Railroads, the immunity granted to self-confessed criminals,\r\n       the strike of the carmen, the hold-up of the Geary-street\r\n       Railroad Company, the forfeiture of its license to operate, all\r\n       seek one common end, the injury of the United Railroads and its\r\n       officials, and the advancement of the personal schemes of the\r\n       private prosecutor.\r\n\r\n       \"I ask from the American people fair play, and a patient\r\n       consideration. I ask them to withhold their judgment, freed\r\n       from the bias naturally created by sensational charges. The\r\n       contest in which I am engaged is grave, and I cannot afford now\r\n       to disclose the whole strength of my hand, but before this\r\n       contest is over, I confidently expect to defeat alike the\r\n       machinations of Rudolph Spreckels, the private prosecutor, with\r\n       his corps of hired detectives, and Mr. Cornelius, president of\r\n       the Carmen's Union, the leader of anarchy and lawlessness, and\r\n       to see firmly established in this community the principles of\r\n       American liberty, and the triumph of truth and justice.\"\r\n\r\n       On May 21 Calhoun issued a statement directly charging the\r\n       lawlessness in San Francisco to the Prosecution. He said:\r\n\r\n       \"The drama is now unfolding itself and the citizens of this\r\n       city will have an opportunity to fix the responsibility for\r\n       existing conditions. The prosecution has said that the\r\n       Supervisors would be 'good dogs' and do its bidding. The\r\n       resolutions concerning the Geary-street line and the United\r\n       Railroads are on a par with the neglect of the board to see\r\n       that order is preserved. The prosecution is now responsible for\r\n       the government of the city: therefore it is responsible for\r\n       existing conditions, including the failure to suppress violence\r\n       and to protect life and property.\"\r\n\r\n [241] Although representatives of the Defense had intimated\r\n       repeatedly that the supporters of the Graft Prosecution had\r\n       brought on the strike for the purpose of injuring the United\r\n       Railroads, when the Prosecution attempted to introduce\r\n       evidence to the contrary, Calhoun's attorneys resisted.\r\n\r\n [242] The seven members of the committee were: F. B. Anderson,\r\n       manager of the Bank of California; Percy T. Morgan, president\r\n       of the California Wine Association and a director in the\r\n       Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company; F. W. Van\r\n       Sicklen, president of Dodge Sweeney & Co.; F. W. Dohrmann,\r\n       president of Nathan, Dohrmann & Co.; Henry Rosenfeld, a\r\n       shipping and commission merchant; C. H. Bentley, president of\r\n       the Chamber of Commerce, and Judge Charles W. Slack, who, in\r\n       1909, was to be one of the principal supporters of the\r\n       opposition to the prosecution candidate for District Attorney.\r\n       Illness compelled Mr. Dohrmann to sever his connection with\r\n       the committee. Mr. William A. Magee served in his stead.\r\n\r\n [243] The Chronicle, in its issue of May 19, printed the following\r\n       as the committee's declaration of principles:\r\n\r\n       \"Declaration of principles by the Committee of Seven and what\r\n       it intends to do:\r\n\r\n       \"We propose to carry out our duty, irrespective of who is\r\n       affected.\r\n\r\n       \"We have adopted the Constitution of the United States as the\r\n       fundamental basis for our final action.\r\n\r\n       \"We intend to bring about a clean condition of affairs in this\r\n       community and make it safe for habitation by human beings and\r\n       for the investment of capital.\r\n\r\n       \"We shall do nothing in the nature of class legislation and\r\n       recognize that every element in the community has a right to\r\n       representation in the government.\"\r\n\r\n [244] In a published statement printed May 19, 1906, Governor\r\n       Gillett said: \"The good citizens of San Francisco are for\r\n       preserving order and the good name of this city, and\r\n       protecting the constitutional rights of its people. The\r\n       Committee of Seven, as I understand it, were appointed for\r\n       this purpose, and every law-abiding citizen and every loyal\r\n       paper in this city, the Bulletin with the rest, are expected\r\n       to strengthen their hands and encourage them in their work.\"\r\n\r\n [245] The failure to enlist Spreckels with the Committee of Seven\r\n       brought down upon him the condemnation of leaders of the State\r\n       machine. \"My surprise at this attitude of Mr. Spreckels,\" said\r\n       Governor Gillett in an interview printed in The Examiner, May\r\n       21, 1907, \"is great. It means a bad moral effect on the local\r\n       industrial disturbance. If a banker like Mr. Spreckels will\r\n       not act in harmony with the committee from the leading\r\n       commercial organizations of this city, then I can readily\r\n       account for the friction all down the line in this city. There\r\n       ought to be unity of action to get the city out of its present\r\n       plight, but evidently the leading business men of the town,\r\n       for reasons I certainly cannot understand, are not in a mood\r\n       to act in harmony.\"\r\n\r\n [246] When the Committee of Seven retired, May 20, Committeeman\r\n       Slack issued the following statement:\r\n\r\n       \"The Committee of Seven yesterday decided that nothing could\r\n       be accomplished by it, in view of the attitude of Mr.\r\n       Spreckels and Mr. Heney. We met those gentlemen for the fourth\r\n       time yesterday morning and were informed that they could not\r\n       act with us. Mr. Spreckels declared, in spite of assurances to\r\n       the contrary from every member of the committee, that he\r\n       believed Herrin and Calhoun to be behind us. We had agreed, in\r\n       the first place, that nothing should be done which would\r\n       interfere in any way with the work of Mr. Spreckels and Mr.\r\n       Heney. When we went to them and asked their co-operation they\r\n       declined to co-operate. Under the circumstances we felt that\r\n       the committee could not be of any further value and asked to\r\n       be discharged.\r\n\r\n       \"I think Mr. Spreckels was sincere in his belief that we\r\n       represented interests opposed to him, and I have nothing but\r\n       the kindest feelings toward him, although I believe that he was\r\n       mistaken. I believe the other members of the committee are with\r\n       me in this.\r\n\r\n       \"My acquaintance with Mr. Herrin is only of the most casual\r\n       sort, and I should be more likely to act against rather than\r\n       for him. I do not know Mr. Calhoun at all.\r\n\r\n       \"It is with great regret that the committee has abandoned the\r\n       work which it felt called upon to undertake, and only the\r\n       belief that without the assistance of Mr. Spreckels its work\r\n       would be valueless led it to take this step.\"\r\n\r\n [247] Governor Gillett's suggestions were contained in a statement\r\n       published in the San Francisco papers on May 25th. It was as\r\n       follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Cornelius, as president of the Carmen's Union, and the\r\n       other labor leaders of San Francisco can bring an end to the\r\n       acts of violence that are committed daily in this city if they\r\n       will, and in the event that they don't they will be held\r\n       morally responsible for what happens in the future, if\r\n       anything of a serious nature does happen.\r\n\r\n       \"San Francisco does not want to see the State troops enter the\r\n       city. It is better for the labor unions, the citizens, the city\r\n       and the State that they should not take charge of affairs, but\r\n       I will say, if this violence continues and increases the\r\n       militia will be brought in and will take charge of affairs.\r\n       Nothing along that line has been planned as yet and the State\r\n       will wait a reasonable length of time for conditions to be\r\n       adjusted.\r\n\r\n       \"Something must be done. There must be a strong governing body\r\n       to take charge of affairs, and along this line I have one\r\n       suggestion to make. Let the various civic bodies of San\r\n       Francisco get together and appoint a committee of twenty-five\r\n       or fifty from their members, a committee of strong-minded men\r\n       who will not allow politics to enter into the question, and who\r\n       will fight for San Francisco as plain citizens interested in\r\n       the welfare of the city.\r\n\r\n       \"Such a committee could accomplish much. The first step to be\r\n       taken would be to demand the appointment of a new police\r\n       commission, the removal of officers in charge of districts who\r\n       are incompetent, and the substitution of competent, firm men.\r\n\r\n       \"Mayor Schmitz would not dare to refuse to accede to the\r\n       demands of such a committee, and if the body acted with a firm\r\n       hand the citizens would soon see an improvement in conditions.\r\n\r\n       \"The executive committee, which appointed the Committee of\r\n       Seven can bring about the organization of such a body as I\r\n       suggest. It was noticeable that when the Committee of Seven\r\n       took hold of affairs there was less violence for a couple of\r\n       days, but as soon as the body tendered its resignation there\r\n       was an increase in these acts of violence.\r\n\r\n       \"Acts of violence must cease. No self-respecting community will\r\n       permit a reign of crime day after day, the throwing of bricks\r\n       and other missiles, the use of vile and abusive language, and\r\n       the beating of men walking along the streets peaceably. Then,\r\n       too, we have our wives and daughters to think of. Conditions\r\n       are certainly deplorable when they cannot go upon the streets\r\n       of a great city like San Francisco without being compelled to\r\n       hear obscene language and witness acts of violence such as have\r\n       been committed within the last three weeks.\r\n\r\n       \"There are strong men here, and if they set about the matter in\r\n       the right way there will be no occasion for the entrance of the\r\n       State troops into the city.\"\r\n\r\n [248] See footnote 229, page 206.\r\n\r\n [249] Of the eighteen Supervisors, two, O'Neil and Tveitmoe, had\r\n       been appointed by Mayor Schmitz to fill vacancies after the\r\n       bribery transactions. They were in no way involved in the\r\n       briberies. They were, therefore, independent of the District\r\n       Attorney. O'Neil put Tveitmoe in nomination against Gallagher.\r\n       \"What is the difference,\" demanded O'Neil, \"between Eugene E.\r\n       Schmitz and James L. Gallagher?\" Gallagher's face went red\r\n       with rage, but there was no way of silencing the critic.\r\n\r\n [250] This tardiness of appointment was not due to any lack of\r\n       candidates. Practically every faction in San Francisco had its\r\n       choice for Schmitz's successor.\r\n\r\n [251] The election of Boxton to be Mayor may be called the\r\n       refinement of cruelty. His elevation to high executive office\r\n       but emphasized the shame of his position. From taking his oath\r\n       of office he was rushed to the witness stand to testify\r\n       against Louis Glass on trial for participation in bribing him\r\n       to oppose the granting of the Home Telephone Company\r\n       franchise. D. M. Delmas was conducting the case for the\r\n       defense. Delmas suavely turned Boxton's elevation to account.\r\n       He scrupulously addressed Boxton as the \"Mayor.\" And, in\r\n       comparison, he wrung from the new Mayor's lips: \"I took bribes\r\n       and was a spy for Halsey.\"\r\n\r\n       Nor did Delmas confine his refined ridicule to the unhappy\r\n       Mayor Boxton. Heney had, for example, asked the court to take\r\n       judicial notice of the fact that while Schmitz was in Europe,\r\n       Gallagher had served as acting Mayor.\r\n\r\n       \"I don't think,\" interrupted Delmas, \"your honor will extend\r\n       your judicial knowledge that far, because that would be to keep\r\n       track of the change of Mayors here, and it would keep you too\r\n       busy to discharge your duties.\"\r\n\r\n       A grim party surrounded Boxton while he took his oath of\r\n       office. Boxton gave no evidence of pride of his new station.\r\n\r\n       \"When I think,\" he said during a lull in the proceedings, \"of\r\n       the things that have come into my life in the last ten years, I\r\n       realize how few of them were of my own planning. When we came\r\n       back from Manila, I had no idea of politics, but they insisted\r\n       in making heroes of us, and I had to run for Supervisor. Now I\r\n       wish I had not done it.\"\r\n\r\n       Later on he gave out the following interview:\r\n\r\n       \"This has come to me as a great surprise. I very much regret\r\n       the circumstances which have led up to this appointment. I hope\r\n       the people will bear with me for the few weeks that I am in\r\n       office. As to my official policy, I cannot discuss that at\r\n       present.\r\n\r\n       \"You know, it is with a feeling of sadness I take the office. I\r\n       am glad it is a temporary appointment and will last only a\r\n       short time. I didn't know when I told you this morning that I\r\n       was willing to do whatever was thought best, either to remain\r\n       in office or to resign from the board, that this would be put\r\n       upon me. I am sorry they have asked me to take the office, and\r\n       will be glad when it is over. The only thing I can say is that\r\n       I believe during the short time I will hold the office the\r\n       people will have no cause to----\"\r\n\r\n       Boxton halted for his words--\"Again find fault with me.\"\r\n\r\n       The Examiner commenting upon Boxton's elevation, said \"Having\r\n       put our bribe-taking Mayor in jail, and having put in his place\r\n       a taker of smaller bribes, we have now substituted for\r\n       Gallagher, Boxton, who differs from Gallagher principally in\r\n       having sold his vote for still less of the bribing\r\n       corporations' money.\"\r\n\r\n [252] The District Attorney's statement of his plan to the various\r\n       organizations concerned will be found in full on page xxii of\r\n       the Appendix.\r\n\r\n [253] The Chronicle, however, endorsed Langdon's plan, and urged the\r\n       several labor and industrial bodies to participate. \"As the\r\n       matter appears at present,\" said The Chronicle, \"the\r\n       prosecution has resorted to the only safe and reasonable plan\r\n       of restoring good government, and fault-finding with the\r\n       method adopted will be confined to the hyper-critical and\r\n       those who imagine that they would find profit in a continuance\r\n       of unsettled conditions.\"\r\n\r\n [254] The resolutions adopted by the Building Trades Council\r\n       rejecting Langdon's plan for reorganization of the municipal\r\n       government, were as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Whereas, An invitation has been received by this council from\r\n       the District Attorney of this city and county, requesting this\r\n       council appoint seven delegates to participate in a convention\r\n       composed of thirty delegates, made up of fifteen\r\n       representatives from the labor organizations of this city and\r\n       fifteen representatives from the civic organizations outside\r\n       of the labor organizations; and whereas, said convention is to\r\n       be called for the purpose of selecting a person to be\r\n       appointed Mayor of the City and County of San Francisco; and\r\n       whereas, at this time this council is not possessed of\r\n       sufficient information upon the subject to determine whether\r\n       or not the action proposed to be taken by the convention would\r\n       be legal, and whether or not such action, if taken, would not\r\n       lead to a multiplicity of suits by reason of the appointment\r\n       to an office where a doubt as to the vacancy in said office\r\n       exists, and as a result lead to endless litigation and\r\n       regrettable confusion; and whereas, those who have arrogated\r\n       to themselves the duty of guiding the destinies of the entire\r\n       municipality of San Francisco only last Tuesday, by the\r\n       exercise of assumed power, through the Board of Supervisors,\r\n       placed in the Mayor's chair one who is to their own knowledge\r\n       legally disqualified, to the exclusion of one or the other of\r\n       two gentlemen who are members of that board in the personnel\r\n       of O. A. Tveitmoe and J. J. O'Neil, whose characters, both\r\n       public and private, are above reproach; and whereas, the\r\n       Building Trades Council was organized and is maintained for\r\n       the purpose of directing, protecting and conducting the\r\n       building industry from the standpoint of the journeymen with\r\n       justice alike to the owner, contractor and artisan, and not\r\n       for the purpose of making mayors through the instrumentality\r\n       of star chamber conventions, thereby usurping the rights and\r\n       prerogatives of the people; therefore, be it\r\n\r\n       \"Resolved, That this Building Trades Council, in regular\r\n       meeting assembled, instruct its secretary to acknowledge the\r\n       receipt of the said invitation, and decline to act thereon for\r\n       the reasons herein stated.\"\r\n\r\n [255] Langdon's reply to the objections of the Merchants' Exchange\r\n       was as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"We cannot entertain any such proposition at this date. We\r\n       have already had submitted to us, and have considered at least\r\n       one hundred plans for calling an electoral convention, and\r\n       after carefully deliberating on all these plans, decided upon\r\n       the plan which we have announced. This plan gives the opposing\r\n       factions of labor and capital each an equal representation in\r\n       the electoral body. The responsibility of deciding who shall\r\n       be the Mayor is distinctly imposed on the two most important\r\n       factions in the community, and as far as giving a square deal\r\n       to everybody, we do not see how our announced plan can be\r\n       improved upon. Certainly the addition of fifteen delegates\r\n       appointed by any special committee cannot improve the plan. In\r\n       our announcement it has been clearly stated that all the\r\n       commercial and labor organizations called have until Saturday\r\n       to name their delegates, and these delegates will assemble\r\n       next Monday to nominate the new Mayor. The plan announced will\r\n       not be modified in any way. It places the issue squarely\r\n       before the people and if they do not wish to act upon it we\r\n       cannot help it.\r\n\r\n       \"In regard to the proposition to permit the electoral\r\n       convention to name sixteen new Supervisors, I will say that\r\n       while there is no objection to it, we do not think it is wise\r\n       to incorporate it in our present plan.\"\r\n\r\n [256] Schmitz's resistance of the elevation of Gallagher no doubt\r\n       influenced the aged Justice in his refusal. From the county\r\n       jail Schmitz continued to insist that he was still the de\r\n       facto Mayor of San Francisco. The Chief of Police, himself\r\n       under indictment, sided with Schmitz. Gallagher during his\r\n       eventful term blocked by the police, was not permitted to\r\n       enter the Mayor's office. When Boxton was made Mayor, Langdon\r\n       went with him to the Mayor's office and seized the furniture.\r\n       Schmitz's partisans boasted that the Mayor would be released\r\n       on bail, march with his followers to the meeting place of the\r\n       Supervisors, and, with the aid of the police, oust Gallagher\r\n       by force. Schmitz's resistance made itself felt in many ways.\r\n       For example, an athletic club had arranged for a boxing match,\r\n       for which a permit signed by the Mayor had to be issued.\r\n       Gallagher had signed the permit. Chief of Police Dinan,\r\n       however, refused to recognize it unless it were signed by\r\n       Schmitz. The manager of the affair was compelled to go to the\r\n       county jail for Schmitz's signature. Schmitz notified the\r\n       bondsmen of City Treasurer Charles A. Bantel that he would\r\n       hold them responsible for any moneys paid out by Bantel\r\n       without his (Schmitz's) signature. The bondsmen notified\r\n       Bantel that as a matter of precaution he must have the\r\n       signature of Schmitz as well as that of Gallagher as\r\n       authorization for paying out funds. This precautionary course\r\n       was followed to its logical conclusion. On July 12, a\r\n       contractor by the name of J. J. Dowling cashed a municipal\r\n       warrant which bore the signatures of no less than three\r\n       Mayors, Schmitz, Gallagher and Boxton.\r\n\r\n       Late in June, Schmitz sent to the auditor warrants signed by\r\n       himself for June salaries for himself, his secretary, his\r\n       stenographer and his usher. The auditor decided to allow these\r\n       warrants for that part of the month up to the date of\r\n       Schmitz's conviction. San Francisco allows its Mayor $300 a\r\n       month for contingent expenses. Both Schmitz and Gallagher\r\n       claimed this $300 for July. The auditor decided to recognize\r\n       neither claim. In answer to Schmitz's demand that Gallagher be\r\n       ignored as Mayor, the auditor sent the imprisoned executive a\r\n       soothing or grimly humorous letter, as one may view it, in\r\n       which he recognized Schmitz as the de jure Mayor, possessing\r\n       \"the honor and the title,\" and Gallagher \"simply as a de facto\r\n       Mayor,\" possessing the office.\r\n\r\n       When the bribe-taking Supervisors resigned, Schmitz, from the\r\n       county jail, appointed their successors. Seven of these Schmitz\r\n       appointees actually took the oath of office. On the night of\r\n       Taylor's election to succeed Boxton as Mayor, one of Schmitz's\r\n       appointees, Samuel T. Sawyer, appeared before the board and\r\n       demanded that he be sworn in as Supervisor. Gallagher, who was\r\n       presiding refused to recognize Schmitz as Mayor and refused\r\n       Sawyer a seat.\r\n\r\n       Even after Taylor had been elected, Chief of Police Dinan\r\n       continued to recognize Schmitz as Mayor. Dinan, for example,\r\n       placed the automobile maintained by the city for the use of the\r\n       Mayor, under guard of a policeman and for several days\r\n       prevented Mayor Taylor securing it.\r\n\r\n       Mayor Taylor gave effective check to this harassing opposition\r\n       by refusing to sign warrants upon the treasury which bore\r\n       Schmitz's signature. Gradually Schmitz's resistance to the new\r\n       order died out.\r\n\r\n       Schmitz contented himself with issuing a statement through the\r\n       Associated Press that he would be a candidate for re-election.\r\n       He said:\r\n\r\n       \"You may announce that I will be a candidate for re-election\r\n       this fall, and that I expect to win. I have already begun my\r\n       campaign in a preliminary way, and shall carry it forward\r\n       steadily from this time. I have no fear of the race. I am\r\n       willing to make it without the aid of the Ruef organization,\r\n       whose support I had in each of the three campaigns since 1901.\r\n       Presumably that organization no longer exists, but its\r\n       component parts, though scattered, are as much in existence as\r\n       ever. It is up to me to gather them together and cement them\r\n       into an organization of my own--a task I am prepared to\r\n       undertake.\"\r\n\r\n [257] Dr. Edward Robeson Taylor was born at Springfield, Ill., Sept.\r\n       24, 1838. He came to California in 1862, In 1865 he graduated\r\n       from the Toland Medical College. In 1872, he was admitted to\r\n       the California bar. He served as dean of the Hastings College\r\n       of Law. For thirty years he was Vice-President and President\r\n       of the Cooper Medical College. He was one of the freeholders\r\n       who framed the present San Francisco municipal charter, and at\r\n       the time of his selection as Mayor, had served San Francisco\r\n       and the State in many important public capacities.\r\n\r\n [258] Dr. Taylor's selection gave general satisfaction. \"My belief\r\n       is,\" said Governor Gillett in a published interview, \"that Joe\r\n       will make an able and trustworthy executive. It is\r\n       particularly fortunate that he is identified with no factional\r\n       politics and can work for a clean reorganized administration\r\n       of the city government.\"\r\n\r\n       \"The most important feature connected with the selection,\"\r\n       said the Chronicle, \"is the doctor's absolute freedom from\r\n       alliances with any particular interest. He is free from all\r\n       entanglements, and his ability and firmness of character give\r\n       assurance that his efforts will be wholly directed to\r\n       bettering the condition and restoring the confidence of the\r\n       community. We repeat that San Francisco owes the doctor a debt\r\n       of gratitude for sinking considerations of personal comfort\r\n       and devoting himself to the general welfare, and that the\r\n       prosecution has acted wisely in selecting and inducing him to\r\n       act.\"\r\n\r\n       On the other hand, The Examiner ridiculed the selection. Labor\r\n       Union party leaders of the type of P. H. McCarthy were loud in\r\n       expressions of their disapproval.\r\n\r\n [259] Mayor Taylor, the day of his election, issued the following\r\n       statement:\r\n\r\n       \"I accepted this office with much reluctance, and only because\r\n       I believed that any man who was requested to serve the city in\r\n       this capacity in the hour of her need should heed the request,\r\n       no matter what the personal sacrifice might be.\r\n\r\n       \"Had any pledges been exacted of me by those who tendered the\r\n       office, I would not have considered the tender for\r\n       one-thousandth part of a second.\r\n\r\n       \"I would not submit to any dictation in the administration of\r\n       the office, nor do I believe that any one who knows me would\r\n       attempt to dictate to me.\r\n\r\n       \"If I am called upon to appoint a Board of Supervisors, I will\r\n       select the very best men who can be induced to accept the\r\n       offices, and I shall exercise my own judgment as to who are the\r\n       best men.\r\n\r\n       \"I am going to do the best I can for the city without regard to\r\n       partisan politics, and, so far as I am concerned, there will be\r\n       no partisan politics.\r\n\r\n       \"As Mayor of this city, every man looks just as tall to me as\r\n       every other man.\r\n\r\n       \"The first essential to good government is perfect order, and I\r\n       shall employ every arm of the law to the end that such order\r\n       shall prevail.\r\n\r\n       \"I believe in autonomy in every department of the city\r\n       government, and I believe that commissioners should be\r\n       permitted to administer the affairs of their respective\r\n       departments, free from dictation, as long as they demonstrate\r\n       by their acts that they are honest and competent.\"\r\n\r\n [260] The citizens named by Dr. Taylor to act as Supervisors were:\r\n\r\n       Dr. A. A. D'Ancona, dean of the Medical Faculty of the\r\n       University of California; Harry U. Brandenstein, attorney and\r\n       former Supervisor; Gustave Brenner, capitalist and retired\r\n       merchant; James P. Booth, newspaperman and former Supervisor;\r\n       A. Comte, Jr., attorney and former Supervisor; George L.\r\n       Center, real estate; Bernard Faymonville, vice-president\r\n       Firemen's Fund Insurance Company; E. J. Molera, civil engineer\r\n       and president of the Academy of Science; W. G. Stafford,\r\n       president of the W. G. Stafford & Co., coal merchants; Henry\r\n       Payot, retired merchant and former Supervisor; Matt I.\r\n       Sullivan, attorney; Thomas Magee, real estate; Lippman Sachs,\r\n       capitalist and retired merchant; L. P. Rixford, architect; C.\r\n       A. Murdock, printing and bookbinding; D. C. Murphy, attorney.\r\n\r\n       A. Comte, Jr., successor of Supervisor McGushin, did not take\r\n       office until several days after his associates on the new\r\n       board. This was due to McGushin's hesitation about resigning.\r\n       Mr. McGushin finally resigned, however, and Comte was named in\r\n       his stead.\r\n\r\n       Of the Taylor Board of Supervisors, The Chronicle, in its issue\r\n       of July 27th, said:\r\n\r\n       \"Mayor Taylor's choice of men for the new Board of Supervisors\r\n       will fortunately not meet universal approval. It will satisfy\r\n       all honest men who regard public office as a public trust and\r\n       not as a private snap, but it will not satisfy those who are\r\n       accustomed either to actually corrupt public servants or to use\r\n       a secret pull to obtain private and undue advantage. It will\r\n       not satisfy the criminal element who thrive by the wide-open\r\n       town, and who abhor a Board of Supervisors who will back up an\r\n       honest and capable Mayor.\r\n\r\n       \"The board which the Mayor has selected may be safely accepted\r\n       as the leaders of the people. All interests are recognized\r\n       except that of the boodlers. The city has many knotty problems\r\n       to solve. Somebody must work them out. Probably no two capable\r\n       and honest men would resolve the various doubts which will\r\n       arise in precisely the same way, and yet out of all the\r\n       possible ways in each case some particular way must be chosen.\r\n       And it will be the duty of the Mayor and Supervisors, in the\r\n       light of much more information than the majority of us can\r\n       obtain, to select that way. And when it has been determined all\r\n       patriotic citizens must get behind them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n                         THE REAL FIGHT BEGINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNine months after Heney assumed his duties as Assistant District\r\nAttorney, Mayor Taylor named the successors of the Ruef-Schmitz Board of\r\nSupervisors.\r\n\r\nIn those nine months much had been accomplished. Ruef had plead guilty\r\nto extortion and had made partial confession of his relations with the\r\npublic-service corporations. The Schmitz-Ruef Supervisors had made full\r\nand free confession, and had been removed from office. Mayor Schmitz had\r\nbeen convicted of extortion, ousted from office, and pending his appeal\r\nto the upper courts was confined in the county jail. The back of the\r\nSchmitz-Ruef political organization was broken, and its forces\r\nscattered.\r\n\r\nHad the Prosecution stopped here, the men whose devotion and\r\nself-sacrifice had made the undoing of the corrupt administration\r\npossible, would have retired with nothing more serious confronting them\r\nthan the condemnation of the impotent puppets of large interests whom\r\nthey had brought to grief. But those behind the Prosecution were not\r\ncontent to leave their work at a point where the regeneration of San\r\nFrancisco had scarcely begun. They proposed to go to the bottom of the\r\ngraft scandal. It was not sufficient, they held, to punish poor men who\r\nwere without friends or influence, while their rich and powerful\r\nassociates went unpunished. The bribe-taking Supervisors might be put\r\nin the penitentiary, but other bribe-taking Supervisors would eventually\r\ntake their places. Ruef, punished by imprisonment, would serve as an\r\nexample for political bosses that would cause them to hesitate for long\r\nbefore embarking in corrupt enterprises such as had brought the\r\ndiscredited boss to grief. This would make it hard for bribe-giving\r\ncorporations to secure agents for bribe-passing, and make bribe-giving\r\ncorrespondingly difficult. But the conviction of high corporation\r\nofficials, responsible for the bribe-giving of public-service\r\ncorporations, was regarded as more important than all, for this would\r\ndemonstrate bribe-giving to be unsafe, and check the practice at its\r\nvery fountain-head. Such conviction, the Prosecution held, would have\r\ngreater deterrent effect against bribery of public officials than the\r\nconfinement of 500 bribe-taking Supervisors in the penitentiary.[261]\r\n\r\n\"I would be willing,\" Rudolph Spreckels testified at the Calhoun trial,\r\n\"to grant immunity to any man who would bring to bar a man of great\r\nwealth who would debauch a city government, and who would use his wealth\r\nto corrupt individuals and tempt men of no means to commit crime in\r\norder that he might make more money.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the stand taken by District Attorney Langdon and his\r\nassociates. The announced policy of the Prosecution, therefore, included\r\nthe prosecution of the bribe-giver to the end. In pursuing this policy,\r\nMr. Langdon and his associates aroused the astonishingly effective\r\nopposition of interests representing hundreds of millions of capital.\r\nEvery indictment of capitalist charged with bribe-giving was signal for\r\na new group of financial leaders, their satellites, beneficiaries and\r\ndependents, to array themselves on the side of the graft defense.[262]\r\n\r\nWith every indictment came a new group of attorneys to raise technical\r\nobjections to the proceedings, all of which the attorneys for the\r\nProsecution were obliged to meet.\r\n\r\nThe first attack was upon the validity of the Grand Jury. The attorneys\r\nfor Ruef and Schmitz had apparently exhausted every point that could be\r\nraised for the disqualification of the Grand Jurors, but this did not\r\nprevent the heads of corporations who found themselves under indictment\r\nmaking similar attacks. And between them, in this new move to quash the\r\nindictments, the defendants enlisted the ablest members of the\r\nCalifornia bar.[263]\r\n\r\nIn this new opposition an astonishing number of technical points were\r\nraised by one or the other of the groups of defending lawyers. Nothing\r\nwas overlooked.\r\n\r\nJust before the principal indictments were brought, for example, the San\r\nFrancisco merchants had given a banquet to celebrate the progress which\r\nSan Francisco had made during the first year following the fire.[264]\r\nLangdon and Heney were given places of honor. They were the heroes of\r\nthe occasion. Every reference to their work was signal for tremendous\r\ndemonstration. There was no suggestion then that the pursuit of\r\ncriminals would \"hurt business.\"\r\n\r\n\"A severe earthquake,\" observed Frank J. Symmes, president of the\r\nMerchants' Association, \"is a serious misfortune, and a great\r\nconflagration a great trial, and each awake the sympathy of the Nation,\r\nbut a corrupt government is at once a crime and a disgrace and brings no\r\nsympathy.\"\r\n\r\n\"We foresee,\" said Bishop William Ford Nichols, another of the speakers\r\nof the evening, \"the greater San Francisco. We mean to make it fairer to\r\nthe eye. But how about making it better? Size and sin may go together.\r\nRehabilitated buildings may house debilitated character.\"\r\n\r\nA month later, after indictments had been brought against some of the\r\nmost prominent business men of the city, word went out that steps would\r\nbe taken to disqualify every member of the Grand Jury who had attended\r\nthat merchants' banquet.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Jurors were again called to the witness stand and put through\r\na grilling to determine whether or not they were biased. Rudolph\r\nSpreckels was under examination for hours in efforts to show that his\r\nmotives in backing the Prosecution were bad.[265]\r\n\r\nEvery step of the proceedings at the organization of the Grand Jury was\r\nscrutinized. The question of the method of employing the stenographer to\r\nthe Grand Jury was made subject of hours of argument. If she were\r\nirregularly employed, it was held, she was an unauthorized person in the\r\nGrand Jury room and her unwarranted presence sufficient to invalidate\r\nthe indictments. Garret McEnerney, representing Eugene de Sabla, Jr.,\r\nFrank Drum and John Martin, whose indictments grew out of the bribery of\r\nthe Supervisors to fix the gas rate at 85 cents per 1000 cubic feet\r\ninstead of 75 cents, was the first to raise this question. But attorneys\r\nfor other defendants took it up and seriously considered it as valid\r\nobjection to the sufficiency of the indictments. A further point was\r\nraised by several of the defendants that the stenographer had not been\r\nproperly sworn. The question was seriously debated, whether she had\r\nlooked at Prosecutor Heney or Foreman Oliver at the moment she was sworn\r\n to secrecy.[266]\r\n\r\nAnother point was brought up by the defendants in the United Railroads\r\nbribery case, that inasmuch as the defendants Calhoun, Mullally and\r\nFord, had been called to the Grand Jury room and compelled to fall back\r\nupon their constitutional rights to avoid testifying, that they had been\r\nplaced in a prejudicial position before the Grand Jury, which\r\nconstituted reversible error.[267] Another objection was that the Grand\r\nJury box had been destroyed in the great fire of 1906, and that no\r\norder had come from any department of the Superior Court ordering its\r\nrestoration. Again, it was asserted, that Grand Juror James E. Gordan\r\nwas a member of the Grand Jury panel of 1906, while the other Grand\r\nJurors were chosen from the 1907 list. Indictments brought by a Grand\r\nJury thus constituted were claimed to be without effect.\r\n\r\nHad any one of these and many other similar objections been sustained,\r\nall indictments against the graft defendants would have been\r\ninvalidated. Every objection had to be met. Days and weeks were spent by\r\nthe District Attorney's office in meeting, or preparing to meet\r\nobjections which to the layman appear trifling and ridiculous.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this technical fight to have the indictments against\r\nthem set aside, the graft defendants received aid from an unlooked-for\r\nsource. Sympathizers with the United Railroads conductors and motormen,\r\nthen on strike, whose union Patrick Calhoun was at the time endeavoring\r\nto crush--and finally did crush--started an independent attack upon the\r\nGrand Jury.\r\n\r\nFour union sympathizers had been indicted in connection with street\r\nriots. Their attorneys, before Superior Judge Cook, raised the point\r\nthat as the Oliver Grand Jury had continued in service after a new panel\r\nhad been drawn in the office of the clerk and put on file, the term of\r\nthe Grand Jury's service had expired. It was, therefore, no longer part\r\nof the machinery of the Court and had no power as an inquisitorial body.\r\nUnder this interpretation, not only would the indictments against the\r\nstrikers be invalidated, but those against the alleged bribe-givers\r\nalso.[268] Thus four of Mr. Calhoun's striking carmen, in their efforts\r\nto evade trial on charges growing out of opposition to the United\r\nRailroads, were making stronger fight to release Mr. Calhoun from\r\nindictment than Mr. Calhoun, although enjoying the ablest legal counsel\r\nthat money could secure, had been able to make for himself.\r\n\r\nEventually, these technical objections were decided adversely to the\r\ndefense; the validity of the Oliver Grand Jury was never successfully\r\nattacked. But the technical objections raised caused delays which the\r\ndefense was able to put to good account. While the prosecution was\r\nbattling to force the graft cases to trial on their merits, the graft\r\ndefense was conducting a publicity campaign to misrepresent and\r\nundermine the prosecution. The astonishing success of these efforts were\r\nto appear later. By 1909, for example, in the city which when the graft\r\nprosecution opened, the practically universal sentiment was for the\r\ncrushing out of corruption, there was strong opinion that the\r\nprosecution of influential offenders had gone too far, had been\r\ninjudiciously conducted, was \"hurting business,\" and that for the good\r\nof the community the graft cases should be dropped.[269]\r\n\r\nThe evident policy of the defense was to undermine the prosecution and\r\ncreate public opinion against it, until both prosecution and community\r\nshould be worn out, and made to quit.\r\n\r\nThe principal attack was through the newspapers. The prosecution had not\r\nbeen long at work before the weekly papers, with few exceptions, were\r\ndevoting the bulk of their space to ridiculing and vilifying all who\r\nwere in any way responsible for the graft exposures and impuning their\r\nmotives.\r\n\r\nWhat these publications received for their work is indicated by the\r\nsubsidies paid one of the least of San Francisco weekly papers--a\r\npublication since suspended--the Mission Times.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1907, a man by the name of Williams purchased the Times for\r\nseventy-five dollars, giving his unsecured note for that amount. In less\r\nthan a month the new proprietor had received $500 from an agent of the\r\nUnited Railroads. Later on, he received a regular subsidy of $250 a\r\nweek, something more than $1,000 a month, which continued for thirteen\r\nweeks. The subsidy was later reduced to fifty dollars a week. But during\r\nthe interim between the weekly subsidy contracts, lump sums were paid.\r\nIt is estimated that in little over a year, Williams received from\r\nagents of the United Railroads upwards of $7,000. The Times at first\r\ncovertly, and later openly, opposed the prosecution. If the unimportant\r\nMission Times, which at the opening of the year 1907 had changed hands\r\nfor seventy-five dollars, received upwards of $7,000 from agents of the\r\ndefense, the not unreasonable question may be asked, what did more\r\nimportant weekly papers, whose graft prosecution policy was practically\r\nthe same as that of the Times, receive? In this connection it is\r\npertinent to say that the majority of these publications gave evidence\r\nduring 1907, of a prosperity that was quite as mysterious, if not as\r\nsuggestive, as had been the prosperity of the Schmitz-Ruef Supervisors\r\nduring 1906.\r\n\r\nAs has been seen, the entire daily press of San Francisco was, in the\r\nbeginning, heartily in accord with the prosecution. Gradually, however,\r\nThe Examiner and The Chronicle[270] shifted their policy. Even while The\r\nChronicle was backing the prosecution in its editorial columns, its\r\nreports of the proceedings at the various hearings were colored in a\r\nway well-calculated to undermine Langdon and his associates.[271]\r\nGradually the covert opposition of its news columns became the open\r\neditorial policy of the paper.\r\n\r\nBut the most effective opposition came from The Examiner. The Examiner\r\nsupported the prosecution until the conviction of Schmitz and the change\r\nin the municipal administration. Failure to dictate the selection of\r\nMayor and Supervisors may have had more or less influence in the change\r\nof policy. At any rate, the invention of The Examiner's writers and\r\nartists was tortured to make the prosecution appear to disadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe most tawdrily clever of The Examiner's efforts were the so-called\r\n\"Mutt cartoons.\" The cartoons appeared from day to day, a continuous\r\nburlesque of the work of the prosecutors, and of the graft trials.\r\n\r\nHeney was pictured as \"Beaney;\" Detective Burns, as Detective \"Tobasco;\"\r\nJames D. Phelan as \"J. Tired Feeling;\" Rudolph Spreckels, as \"Pickles;\"\r\nSuperior Judges Dunne and Lawlor, before whom the graft cases were\r\nheard, as Judge \"Finished\" and Judge \"Crawler,\" respectively. In these\r\n\"Mutt cartoons\" every phase of the prosecution was ridiculed. For\r\nexample, when the excitement over the graft trials was at its height,\r\nthere were rumors that the assassination of Heney or Langdon would be\r\nattempted. In ridiculing this, The Examiner pictured \"Beaney\" with a\r\ncross on his neck where the bullet was to strike. A few weeks later,\r\nduring the progress of one of the graft trials, Heney was shot down in\r\nopen court, the bullet taking practically the same course which in the\r\n\"Mutt\" cartoon The Examiner had pictured. After the shooting of Heney,\r\nThe Examiner discontinued the anti-prosecution \"Mutt cartoons.\"\r\n\r\nMr. William Randolph Hearst's San Francisco Examiner did effective\r\nservice in discrediting the graft prosecution. But Mr. Hearst, with\r\ncurious inconsistency, outside California, gave the prosecution his\r\npersonal endorsement.\r\n\r\nIn his Labor Day address at the Jamestown Exposition, September 3, 1907,\r\nfor example, Mr. Hearst among other pleasing observations on the work of\r\nthe San Francisco Graft Prosecution, said: \"You hear much today of how a\r\nMayor of San Francisco has fallen, but you hear little of how powerful\r\npublic service corporations tempted a wretched human being with great\r\nwealth and brought a once respected man to ruin and disgrace. You hear\r\nmuch of how a Mayor elected on a Union Labor ticket is in jail, but\r\nlittle of the fact that it was an honest District Attorney, elected on\r\nthe same Union Labor ticket, who put him there, an honest District\r\nAttorney, who is doing his best to put beside the Mayor the men really\r\nresponsible for all this debauchery and dishonor. While it is the\r\nfashion to criticise San Francisco just now, I venture to assert that\r\nthe only difference between San Francisco and some other cities is that\r\nSan Francisco is punishing her corruptionists. There is many an official\r\nelsewhere who has stolen office or dealt in public properties who would\r\nfare like Schmitz if there were more honest and fearless District\r\nAttorneys like Union Labor Langdon.\"\r\n\r\nLater on, after Ruef had been sent to the penitentiary, an article on\r\nthe San Francisco Graft Prosecution appeared in one of Mr. Hearst's\r\nmagazines.[272] The article was printed under the signature of Mr.\r\nEdward H. Hamilton, one of the ablest of Mr. Hearst's employees. Mr.\r\nHamilton gave the credit for the work of the graft prosecution to Mr.\r\nHearst and The Examiner. The men whose steadfastness of purposes and\r\nhigh integrity had made even approach to the prosecution of influential\r\noffenders possible, upon whom Mr. Hearst's Examiner had poured ridicule\r\nand abuse, were more or less favorably mentioned in the article, but Mr.\r\nHearst was given the bulk of the credit for what the prosecution had\r\naccomplished. In California, where The Examiner's treatment of the\r\nprosecution was well known, Mr. Hamilton's article was received with\r\nsome amusement and not a little resentment.[273]\r\n\r\nAlthough, with few exceptions, the policy of the San Francisco press was\r\nadverse to the prosecution, the principal interior papers gave Langdon\r\nand his associates loyal support. But eventually a chain of papers\r\ncovering the greater part of the interior of northern and central\r\nCalifornia was enlisted on the side of the defense. The papers were\r\nstarted or purchased by a newspaper publishing company known as the\r\nCalkins Syndicate.\r\n\r\nThe Calkins people had for several years been identified with a number\r\nof unimportant papers, printed in the interior. Suddenly, from\r\npublishing obscure weeklies and dailies, the Calkins Syndicate became\r\none of the most important, if not the most important, publishing concern\r\nin California. A modern printing plant, one of the finest on the Pacific\r\nCoast, was installed at San Francisco. The establishment took over much\r\nof the printing of the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, including the\r\nprinting of the railroad corporation's monthly, The Sunset Magazine. The\r\nSacramento Union, the most important California morning newspaper\r\nprinted north of San Francisco, and the Fresno Herald, an afternoon\r\ndaily, were purchased outright. A bid was made for the San Francisco\r\nPost,[274] but terms could not be made. The Calkins people accordingly\r\nstarted the San Francisco Globe, an afternoon daily newspaper. Less\r\nimportant papers were established at various points. In an incredibly\r\nshort period, the Calkins Syndicate had a chain of newspapers covering\r\nthe greater part of northern and central California.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive feature of these publications was their opposition to\r\nthe San Francisco graft prosecution. But the abuse of the Calkins\r\nnewspapers was not so cleverly presented as in the Examiner, nor so\r\nadroitly handled as in the Chronicle. So violent were the Calkins\r\npapers' attacks, in fact, that they injured rather than assisted the\r\ndefendants' cause. This was generally recognized. The Calkins Syndicate,\r\nafter losing whatever effectiveness it may have had, eventually went\r\ninto bankruptcy.[275]\r\n\r\nAlmost as effective as the newspaper publicity against the prosecution,\r\nwas the opposition of fashionable social circles and of the clubs. The\r\ngraft defendants became much in evidence at the best clubs in the city.\r\nTo be sure, their persistent appearance all but disrupted some of the\r\nclubs, members in sympathy with the enforcement of the law openly\r\nobjecting to their presence.[276] But in the end, the defendants\r\nprevailed and were loudly apparent at the principal clubs of the city\r\neven while under the inconvenience of indictment.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco's so-called fashionable society was, during the graft\r\ntrials, practically organized as an adjunct of the defense. Those in\r\naccord with the prosecution were cut off visiting lists. Some of the\r\nnon-resident indicted ones brought their families to San Francisco.\r\nTheir wives and daughters at once became prominent in social matters. It\r\nwas the refinement of the custom of bringing in \"the wife and innocent\r\nchildren\" of the defendant at a criminal trial.\r\n\r\nThis character of defense was most effective. The charming\r\nentertainment of those wives and daughters of indicted magnates who\r\nengaged in the social publicity campaign in the interests of their\r\ntroubled male relations, went far toward building up public opinion\r\nagainst their prosecutors. The supporters of the prosecutors were\r\ntreated with scant ceremony. To be a supporter of the prosecution was\r\nnot regarded as \"good form.\" All in all, the social side was one of the\r\ncleverest and most effective features of the publicity campaign carried\r\non by the graft defense.[277]\r\n\r\nThe boycott of those in sympathy with the prosecution extended to the\r\nlarger business world as well as to exclusive social circles. When, for\r\nexample, the American battleship fleet visited San Francisco on its tour\r\naround the world in 1908, the committee appointed by the Mayor to\r\narrange fitting reception and entertainment of its visitors, organized\r\nby making James D. Phelan, prominently associated with Mr. Spreckels in\r\nthe Graft Prosecution, chairman.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Phelan should be made head of the committee, or even identified\r\nwith it, gave serious offense to the large business and financial\r\ninterests that did not approve the prosecution.[278] The large interests\r\nthus offended refused to contribute to the reception fund. William C.\r\nRalston, United States Sub-Treasurer at San Francisco, and treasurer of\r\nthe Fleet Reception Committee, reported to the committee that several\r\nlarge banks and public service corporations would not contribute to the\r\nreception of the fleet unless Mr. Phelan left the reception\r\ncommittee.[279]\r\n\r\nThe committee, refusing to submit to this arrogant dictation,\r\naccordingly proceeded to the entertainment of the fleet without\r\nassistance from the anti-prosecution financiers and institutions. The\r\nsmaller merchants, assisted by those banks and enterprises which had not\r\nbeen offended by the proceedings against the corrupters of the municipal\r\ngovernment, contributed upwards of $75,000. The reception to the fleet\r\nwas thus carried to successful conclusion without the assistance of the\r\ngraft defense element.\r\n\r\nIn the work of undermining the prosecution, the humbler circles of\r\nmunicipal life were not neglected. The claquer in labor union, and\r\nwherever groups of laboring men and women met, was quite as active as\r\nhis prototype at club and exclusive function. In labor circles the\r\nprosecution was described as a movement to discredit labor and to\r\ndisrupt the unions. Here, Rudolph Spreckels was described as the\r\nunrelenting foe of labor organizations. At club and function, on the\r\nother hand, the prosecution was condemned as agent of \"labor\r\norganization and anarchy,\" and Mr. Spreckels denounced as a man who had\r\n\"gone back on his class.\" In all quarters stories were circulated,\r\nquestioning Spreckels' motives. The most persistent charge against him\r\nwas that he had started a street-car system of his own, and had\r\ninstituted the graft prosecution to drive the United Railroads out of\r\nbusiness. This story was told and retold, although the purposes for\r\nwhich Mr. Spreckels had contemplated engaging in the street-car business\r\nwere well known.[280] It was quite as well known, too, that the\r\nbriberies alleged against officials of the United Railroads were\r\ncommitted long after the graft prosecution had been inaugurated.\r\n\r\nHeney[281] was also made target for criticisms. His whole life was gone\r\nover in the search for flaws. It was discovered that in self-defense he\r\nhad, years before, shot a man in Arizona.[282] This was made basis of a\r\ncharge that Heney had committed murder. The new version of the Arizona\r\nincident was fairly shouted from San Francisco housetops.\r\n\r\nHeney was denounced as a \"special prosecutor, a human bloodhound,\r\nengaged in hounding of men to the penitentiary.\" It was charged against\r\nhim that he had received excessive fees from corporations; that he had\r\naccepted fees from the Federal government while acting as deputy to the\r\nSan Francisco District Attorney, and that therefore his San Francisco\r\nemployment was illegal;[283] that he had been a drunkard.\r\n\r\nA most effective attack consisted in charging connection of the graft\r\nprosecution with the California Safe Deposit and Trust Company.\r\n\r\nThis institution closed its doors during the 1907 panic. It had carried\r\nan enormous volume of deposits. Thousands of homes were affected. The\r\nCalifornia Safe Deposit and Trust Company was, as a result, very\r\nunpopular. Stories were circulated that the company had backed the\r\nprosecution, and had contributed funds for its work. J. Dalzell Brown,\r\none of the leading spirits of the company, was also described as one of\r\nthe prosecution's backers. It was shown at the Calhoun[284] trial that\r\nneither Brown nor his company had contributed a dollar toward the\r\nprosecution fund. Nevertheless, persistent reports that the prosecution\r\nhad had this support, unquestionably had its effect upon the losing\r\ndepositors. Hiram W. Johnson had acted as Brown's attorney. Johnson had\r\nappeared as assistant to the District Attorney at a number of the graft\r\ntrials. Johnson was condemned for taking the case of a criminal guilty\r\nof the offenses charged against Brown. Mr. Johnson's critics did not,\r\nhowever, condemn the attorneys who had taken the cases of the alleged\r\nbribe-givers.\r\n\r\nAnother charge was that the prosecution was hurting business; that the\r\nmaterial prosperity of California demanded that the proceedings be\r\nstopped; that capital would not seek investment in California until the\r\ndisturbance caused by the prosecution had subsided.\r\n\r\nEvery move of the prosecution was made subject of criticism.\r\nAnnouncement, for example, that immunity had been given the Supervisors\r\nwas received by the anti-prosecution press with a storm of protest, and\r\nused by the pro-defense claque most effectively.\r\n\r\nThe treatment accorded Ruef was subject of constant objection and\r\ncriticism. During the period of Ruef's apparent co-operation with the\r\nprosecution, when he was in custody of the elisor, the pro-defense press\r\nharped on the uselessness of the expense of keeping Ruef in the luxury\r\nof a private jail.[285] The Chronicle even went so far as to say it\r\nwould be well if Ruef forfeited his bail, provided the bail were set\r\nhigh enough. Ruef was, at the time, thought to be a willing witness for\r\nthe prosecution. That the case of The People would be weakened were he\r\nto leave the State did not seem to appeal to the Chronicle. Later on,\r\nwhen it became evident that Ruef was not assisting the prosecution,\r\nthere were outcries against the alleged cruel treatment that had been\r\nimposed upon him during his confinement in the custody of the elisor.\r\n\r\nBut this potent and far-reaching opposition did not cause a moment's\r\nhesitation on the part of the prosecution. The work of bringing\r\ninfluential offenders before trial juries went steadily on. As soon as\r\nthe Schmitz extortion case had been disposed of, Louis Glass of the\r\nPacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company, the first of the\r\nindicted capitalists to face a jury, was brought to trial.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [261] Heney's attitude toward the bribe-givers is expressed in an\r\n       affidavit filed in the case of The People vs. Calhoun et als.,\r\n       No. 823. Heney in setting forth a statement made to Rabbi\r\n       Nieto says:\r\n\r\n       \"I consider that the greatest benefit which we will have done\r\n       this city and this country by these prosecutions will be the\r\n       insight which we will have given them into the causes of\r\n       corruption in all large cities, and into the methods by which\r\n       this corruption is maintained. The testimony of the members of\r\n       the Board of Supervisors throws great light on this question,\r\n       and Ruef could aid considerably in making it an object lesson\r\n       to the world, if he would do so. The only way we can stop this\r\n       kind of corruption is by enlightening the people as to its\r\n       causes and by thereafter endeavoring to remove the temptation\r\n       which causes evil by proper remedial legislation, and in order\r\n       to impress this object lesson on the people strongly enough to\r\n       accomplish much good we must punish the principal men who have\r\n       been involved in it. Do not imagine this is a pleasant task to\r\n       me. It is far from being so. It involves men like Frank Drum,\r\n       whom I liked and respected as a friend for years, and who has\r\n       quite recently paid me a good attorney's fee for services\r\n       performed for a company represented by him. I have met Patrick\r\n       Calhoun socially, and greatly admire his ability and found him\r\n       to be a man of very agreeable, attractive manners. I wish\r\n       there was some other way to secure a proper deterrent effect\r\n       without causing these men and their innocent families to\r\n       suffer, but unless the laws are enforced, Doctor, our\r\n       republican form of government cannot continue very long. It is\r\n       not sufficient to punish the poor man who has no friends or\r\n       influence. The people will lose respect for the courts and for\r\n       the law unless the rich and powerful can be made to obey the\r\n       laws. It has a greater deterrent effect, in my opinion, to put\r\n       one rich and influential man in prison than to put a thousand\r\n       poor ones there. It would do no good to send a few miserable,\r\n       ignorant Supervisors to the penitentiary. Others of the same\r\n       kind would soon take their places, and the carnival of crime\r\n       would continue as before. If we can put Ruef in the\r\n       penitentiary it will have a wholesome effect upon other\r\n       political bosses for the next decade at least. And if we can\r\n       put a few captains of industry there with him, and\r\n       particularly a few of the head officials of public service\r\n       corporations, it will have a greater deterrent effect against\r\n       bribery of public officials than putting five hundred of such\r\n       officials in the penitentiary.\"\r\n\r\n [262] \"I subscribed to the Graft Prosecution fund,\" said one\r\n       capitalist whose own skirts were clean of the graft scandal,\r\n       \"but before the investigation was over I had to exert myself\r\n       to prevent my own attorney going to jail.\"\r\n\r\n       The manner in which every indictment increased the circle of\r\n       opposition to the prosecution is well illustrated by the\r\n       following selection from the San Francisco Chronicle of March\r\n       25, 1907:\r\n\r\n       \"The indictment of Louis Glass, former vice-president of the\r\n       Pacific States Telephone Company, for bribery, on testimony\r\n       given to the Grand Jury by E. J. Zimmer, who was the auditor of\r\n       the company under Glass, and is now vice-president of the\r\n       reorganized corporation, has caused consternation in certain\r\n       fashionable circles, in which Glass was one of the most popular\r\n       men.\r\n\r\n       \"At the clubs of which the indicted telephone magnate was a\r\n       member, much sympathy is expressed for him. He was extremely\r\n       popular because of his affability and good-fellowship, and he\r\n       has a host of friends, who are loth to believe that he has\r\n       committed a crime which may put him behind the bars of San\r\n       Quentin for fourteen years.\r\n\r\n       \"Attorney George Knight, who, it is expected, will be retained\r\n       as counsel for Glass, voiced the sentiment of many of his\r\n       friends, yesterday, when he said:\r\n\r\n       \"'Louis Glass is one of the best fellows in a social way that\r\n       ever lived. He is proud, high-spirited and in all his personal\r\n       relations with others he has always been most particular. I\r\n       cannot imagine what has led him into doing what he is said to\r\n       have done in the telephone bribery, and I am sure that in spite\r\n       of the indictment, when the truth is known, he will not appear\r\n       in such a discreditable light.'\"\r\n\r\n [263] Among those who challenged the validity of the Grand Jury\r\n       were: Patrick Calhoun, Thornwell Mullally, Tirey L. Ford and\r\n       William Abbott of the United Railroads, represented by A. A.\r\n       Moore and Stanley Moore; Louis Glass of the Pacific States\r\n       Telephone Company, represented by Delmas and Coogan; John\r\n       Martin, Eugene de Sabla and Frank Drum of the San Francisco\r\n       Gas and Electric Company, represented by Garret McEnerney; T.\r\n       V. Halsey, represented by Bert Schlesinger, William P.\r\n       Humphries and D. M. Delmas. The several attorneys represented\r\n       the best legal ability obtainable in San Francisco. No less\r\n       than fifty-two attorneys, all working to the same end, were\r\n       employed by the several graft defendants.\r\n\r\n [264] The Merchants' Association banquet, April 18, 1907, the first\r\n       anniversary of the great earthquake and fire.\r\n\r\n [265] At one of the examinations of Spreckels, Attorney A. A. Moore,\r\n       representing the United Railroads, is reported as demanding:\r\n\r\n       \"Can it be that we have got to a point where a private\r\n       prosecution, hiring a lawyer, hiring an attorney, hiring a\r\n       detective--and then when indictments are found that you cannot\r\n       set them aside? That is the line of testimony I intend to\r\n       pursue.\"\r\n\r\n       \"In addition,\" said Attorney Stanley Moore, A. A. Moore's\r\n       associate in the defense, \"we expect to show that Mr. Spreckels\r\n       is the head and shoulders of a large street railroad company,\r\n       organized by himself for the purpose of putting the United\r\n       Railroads out of business.'\r\n\r\n       \"I will say this again,\" went on Moore, \"we will prove the\r\n       statement that we have made, to wit: that Mr. Heney was an\r\n       unauthorized person before the Grand Jury by reason of the fact\r\n       that he was during all that time privately employed by Rudolph\r\n       Spreckels, who was entertaining a plan to destroy the property\r\n       of the United Railroads, and to carry out that plan they gave\r\n       immunity to the Board of Supervisors to carry out their\r\n       bidding.\"\r\n\r\n [266] The Chronicle, in its issue of June 7, 1907, in discussing the\r\n       delaying tactics of the defendants, said:\r\n\r\n       \"It cannot be too often repeated that in connection with the\r\n       boodle cases there are but two questions which are of\r\n       importance, and those are, first: Did the accused commit\r\n       bribery within the meaning of the statute? and secondly, If\r\n       not, did they commit bribery in such a way that the law cannot\r\n       reach them? Both these questions will be settled by the\r\n       evidence in the trials. If the verdict is that the accused\r\n       committed bribery within the meaning of the statute, they will\r\n       go to State's prison. If the evidence shows that they\r\n       committed bribery so skilfully that it cannot be legally\r\n       proved, they will not go to the penitentiary, but they will\r\n       stand disgraced men and unconvicted felons. In either case all\r\n       that an honest man prizes most highly is at stake, and as all\r\n       claim to be as innocent as unborn babes, one would expect the\r\n       band to be tumbling over each other in their eagerness to be\r\n       first to face a jury and rehabilitate their damaged\r\n       reputations by a public demonstration of their untarnished\r\n       character.\r\n\r\n       \"Quite the contrary. So far from their taking this obvious\r\n       course to secure justification the aid of a shining and costly\r\n       array of legal talent is invoked to prevent, if it may be\r\n       possible, any show-down whatever of the evidence in any court.\r\n       They object to even coming into court and pleading whether they\r\n       are guilty or not. It is declared that it will be alleged that\r\n       the purported Grand Jury, which went through the form of\r\n       indicting them, is an illegal body, with no standing whatever\r\n       in court, and that, therefore, there is no indictment at all.\r\n       It will not, apparently, be claimed that the members of the\r\n       alleged Grand Jury were not discreet citizens, legally\r\n       competent to serve as Grand Jurors; that they were not\r\n       regularly appointed as such according to law; that they were\r\n       not duly sworn into office, or that, having listened to sworn\r\n       evidence delivered under the forms of law, these reputable\r\n       citizens, upon that evidence, accuse them of felony. None of\r\n       these things, it is supposed, will be alleged. What is to be\r\n       alleged, it is said, is that the number of names from which the\r\n       Grand Jury was drawn was 113, instead of 125, which, by the\r\n       way, is promptly denied. What earthly bearing could that have,\r\n       if it were true, on the guilt or innocence of the men accused\r\n       of felony? Can it be conceived as possible, even if that were\r\n       proved, that our laws are drawn so completely in the interest\r\n       of criminals as to enable men accused of felony to escape\r\n       trial?\r\n\r\n       \"The personal character and qualifications of the Grand Jurors\r\n       were fully brought out in the Ruef case. For weeks they were\r\n       subjected to a grilling which it was a disgrace to our laws to\r\n       permit. That was not repeated in the Schmitz case. In that the\r\n       counsel of the accused have seemed to be relying for\r\n       overturning a conviction on the alleged over-zealousness of the\r\n       prosecuting officer. Again, what has that to do with the guilt\r\n       or innocence of the accused, even if it has occurred? A\r\n       District Attorney is in possession of all the evidence, and if\r\n       that is such as to arouse his indignation, shall the people\r\n       thereby be deprived of all remedy? Obvious misconduct of an\r\n       attorney is more likely to injure the people than the accused.\r\n       It could hardly have any other influence on the verdict of a\r\n       jury. If no crimes are to be punished in which there is\r\n       energetic prosecution, which may occasionally involve\r\n       expressions which the law discountenances, we may about as well\r\n       shut up our criminal courts. Almost any attorney may be baited\r\n       into making uncourteous remarks. Happily the Supreme Court has\r\n       recently decided that no matter what the District Attorney\r\n       does, a felon duly convicted upon sufficient evidence shall not\r\n       thereby be turned loose. And that is as it should be.\"\r\n\r\n [267] Heney in court made caustic answer to this argument: \"After\r\n       the Supervisors had confessed,\" he began, \"and sixteen of them\r\n       had testified that they had been paid $4,000 apiece to vote\r\n       for the trolley franchise, these defendants thought in their\r\n       own minds that they were so connected with the crime that\r\n       Patrick Calhoun, Thornwell Mullally and Tirey L. Ford each\r\n       made a public explanation in the press, denying that they had\r\n       bribed a city official. A crime had been committed, and the\r\n       first question to be asked was, Who had the motive? The\r\n       Supervisors had testified that they received the money from\r\n       Gallagher, and Gallagher had testified that he received it\r\n       from Ruef. Did Abraham Ruef own the trolley lines? The\r\n       question arose as to who had the motive. Ford and Mullally\r\n       came to me personally and told me they had not bribed a city\r\n       official. Wasn't that an explanation? Will it not be an\r\n       explanation when these defendants are put on trial that they\r\n       will say it was an attorney's fee? If, under these\r\n       circumstances, the Grand Jury cannot call the officers of the\r\n       company to learn who authorized the giving of the bribe money,\r\n       what would an investigation be worth? If we had not called\r\n       them, then you would have heard the other cry, that this was a\r\n       conspiracy to destroy the good name of Patrick Calhoun.\r\n\r\n       \"If it had been a poor, ignorant man, or a helpless woman--if\r\n       the Grand Jury had dragged her from the jail and compelled her\r\n       to testify against herself, and she had not known what her\r\n       constitutional right was, it would have been a different\r\n       picture. But these four gentlemen are learned in the law. One\r\n       of them had been Attorney-General of this State, another had\r\n       been his assistant in that office for four years. Mullally is\r\n       an attorney and Patrick Calhoun is an attorney whose mind is\r\n       equal to that of any man's in California.\r\n\r\n       \"Advised of their rights! Why, they came in there on a subpoena\r\n       which General Ford has declared in his own affidavit was faulty\r\n       and ineffective. They came on a defective process, which they\r\n       knew to be defective. They refused to be sworn, and they were\r\n       not sworn, and they left the Grand Jury room without having\r\n       answered a question, for the purpose of coming solemnly here to\r\n       get these indictments set aside on the grounds that their\r\n       constitutional rights have been invaded. That's trifling with\r\n       the law. Laws weren't made to juggle with. Laws were made for\r\n       the protection of the innocent.\r\n\r\n       \"They knew they didn't have to go, but they went, and they\r\n       refused to testify; and now they want the indictments set aside\r\n       because their great constitutional rights have been tampered\r\n       with.\r\n\r\n       \"They say he could have waived the point and testified, but\r\n       because he refused and walked out he has been deprived of his\r\n       constitutional right.\"\r\n\r\n [268] In commenting upon the point raised by the indicted carmen,\r\n       the Chronicle, in its issue of July 30, 1907, said:\r\n\r\n       \"In attacking the legality of the Grand Jury the attorneys of\r\n       the carmen indicted for making assaults with deadly weapons\r\n       and throwing bricks at street cars may have played into the\r\n       hands of their arch enemy, the president of the United\r\n       Railroads. If the Supreme Court should hold that the Oliver\r\n       Grand Jury passed out of legal existence when the 144 new\r\n       names were selected by the twelve Superior Judges, the\r\n       indictments against those connected with the telephone, gas,\r\n       trolley and Parkside briberies would be set aside and all the\r\n       work of the prosecution would have to be done over. It would\r\n       be a curious outcome to the efforts of an attorney to free men\r\n       charged with crimes which the unions condemn, but it would not\r\n       be the first instance of a miscarriage of the purposes of\r\n       organized labor.\"\r\n\r\n [269] Some went so far when examined for jury service at the later\r\n       graft trials as to say they would not vote to convict.\r\n\r\n [270] The graft investigation uncovered something of the curious\r\n       ethics governing this sort of publicity. For example, Mark L.\r\n       Gerstle of the law firm of Thomas, Gerstle and Frick, who\r\n       acted as attorneys for the Home Telephone Company, testified\r\n       before the Grand Jury that the company paid the San Francisco\r\n       Chronicle $10,000 to educate the people to the idea of a\r\n       competing telephone system. The testimony was as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Q. During that time in 1905, were any newspapers paid to help\r\n       the good cause? A. Yes.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. What papers? A. Only one.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. What paper was that? A. Chronicle.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. How much was paid to it? A. $10,000.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. What were the terms of that employment? A. The object of\r\n       paying that money was to educate the people to the idea of a\r\n       competitive telephone system. There seemed to be a prejudice\r\n       among everybody, or a great many people, as to the value or\r\n       necessity of another telephone system, and we could not obtain\r\n       the assistance of any newspaper in that work without paying for\r\n       it. Some required it in the shape of advertising which we did\r\n       not need--don't do any good--others wouldn't take it in that\r\n       way; the Chronicle wouldn't take it that way and we were forced\r\n       in order to have some newspaper assist us in that work, to pay\r\n       the price which was $10,000.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Did they give editorial work for that? A. No. They were\r\n       supposed when the matters came up before the Board of\r\n       Supervisors to write it up favorably, that is to say, talk\r\n       about the advantage of a competitive telephone system in the\r\n       way of keeping out a monopoly, and doing away with the poor\r\n       system of the Pacific States.\"\r\n\r\n [271] The Chronicle's reports of the work of the Graft Prosecution\r\n       are models of the journalism which strikes in the dark. When,\r\n       for example, the defense called Rudolph Spreckels to the stand\r\n       in its efforts to disqualify the Grand Jury, The Chronicle,\r\n       while in its editorial columns condemning such proceedings,\r\n       reported the incident in its news columns as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Spreckels, who had been keeping in the background, came\r\n       forward, glancing furtively at Heney, whose lips were moving\r\n       nervously.\" In the column from which this quotation is taken,\r\n       Heney is represented as replying \"nervously\" to charges made\r\n       by attorneys for the defense, and Spreckels, when a question\r\n       was put to him as looking \"appealingly\" to the attorney\r\n       representing the prosecution. But observers of the proceedings\r\n       recall no perceptible nervousness on Heney's part, nor\r\n       \"furtive\" nor \"appealing\" glances from Spreckels.\r\n\r\n [272] The Cosmopolitan, issue of July, 1911.\r\n\r\n [273] The Sacramento Bee, in an editorial article, \"Laureling the\r\n       Brow of a Harlequin 'Reformer',\" said of Mr. Hamilton's claims\r\n       for Hearst:\r\n\r\n       \"The San Francisco Examiner is advertising an article by\r\n       Edward H. Hamilton in the July Cosmopolitan--an article which\r\n       is a tissue of the most shameless misrepresentations from\r\n       beginning to end--an article which falsely and most\r\n       mendaciously credits the conviction and imprisonment of\r\n       Abraham Ruef to William Randolph Hearst.\r\n\r\n       \"The Cosmopolitan is a Hearst magazine; Hamilton, a Hearst\r\n       writer. Undoubtedly in New York many will believe Hamilton has\r\n       written the truth. Every man in California knows otherwise.\r\n\r\n       \"It is strange that a writer with the ability and the\r\n       reputation of Edward H. Hamilton would for any consideration\r\n       write an article so brazenly false that one marvels at the\r\n       audacity alike of the eulogist and the laureled.\r\n\r\n       \"For Hearst had no more to do with the fate of Ruef than Ruef's\r\n       own lawyers. He labored on the same side--to make the graft\r\n       prosecution so unpopular that no conviction of the guilty could\r\n       result. Day in and day out the Examiner reeked with slanders\r\n       aimed at the men who were endeavoring to place Ruef behind the\r\n       bars.\r\n\r\n       \"Day in and day out, the most malicious cartoons were published\r\n       against Spreckels, Heney, Phelan, Burns and all who were\r\n       battling for the punishment of public and semi-public\r\n       scoundrels. Day in and day out in the Examiner Judge Wm. P.\r\n       Lawlor was referred to as 'Crawler.'\r\n\r\n       \"Day in and day out the reports of the trials were so colored,\r\n       so exaggerated in favor of the defense and so emasculated when\r\n       the prosecution scored a point, that the Examiner was ranked\r\n       with the gutter weeklies as a friend, champion and defender of\r\n       the indicted, and a most venomous traitor to good government\r\n       and to public honor.\r\n\r\n       \"The Examiner knew the feeling against it in San Francisco.\r\n       For, when Heney was shot and there was danger of mob violence,\r\n       the editorial rooms of the Examiner were barricaded and the\r\n       Examiner men were supplied with rifles.\r\n\r\n       \"And their fears were to a certain extent justified. One of the\r\n       vilest cartoons against Heney pictured 'Beany' in danger of his\r\n       life from imaginary assassins. On 'Beany's' neck was a mark to\r\n       show where the bullet was to strike. By an extraordinary\r\n       coincidence, the bullet that struck Heney down at the Ruef\r\n       trial found almost the identical spot that a few days before\r\n       had been marked on 'Beany's' neck in Hearst's humorous cartoon.\r\n\r\n       \"On the night of the day that Heney was shot, indignant San\r\n       Francisco in an immense mass meeting thundered its denunciation\r\n       of Hearst and the Examiner. And graft-prosecution leaders found\r\n       it necessary to plead with an inflamed populace to attempt no\r\n       violence.\r\n\r\n       \"No more 'Beany' cartoons made their appearance. The Examiner\r\n       wrote of all connected with the graft prosecution in terms of\r\n       respect. But this repentance born of fear did not prevent\r\n       Californians by the thousands stopping the Examiner.\r\n\r\n       \"The Cosmopolitan eulogy of Hearst in the graft-prosecution\r\n       matter is a long line of known misstatements from beginning to\r\n       end.\r\n\r\n       \"It is humiliating to have to record that a man of Ned\r\n       Hamilton's talents could so debase them as to present in the\r\n       light of a militant Paul of the graft prosecution one who was\r\n       its most contemptible Judas Iscariot.\r\n\r\n      \"Regrettable indeed is it that\r\n\r\n               \"Poor Ned 'must torture his invention\r\n               To flatter rogues or lose his pension.'\"\r\n\r\n [274] After the failure of the Calkins syndicate its successors to\r\n       the ownership of \"The Globe,\" purchased the Post and combined\r\n       the two in one publication under the name of Post-Globe. The\r\n       policy of the paper was not changed.\r\n\r\n [275] The astonishing business conditions under which the Calkins\r\n       Syndicate was conducted were brought out during the\r\n       proceedings in bankruptcy. For example: The Union Trust\r\n       Company, closely connected financially with the Southern\r\n       Pacific Company, and the United Railroads, advanced the\r\n       syndicate $175,000.\r\n\r\n       To secure this loan, the Syndicate gave the Union Trust\r\n       Company as collateral 1251 shares of the 2500 shares of the\r\n       capital stock of the Sacramento Publishing Company, 150,100\r\n       shares of the 300,000 shares of the capital stock of the\r\n       Calkins Publishing House, the majority of the capital stock of\r\n       the Fresno Publishing Company, which published the Fresno\r\n       \"Herald\" and bonds of the company publishing the San Francisco\r\n       \"Globe,\" valued at $30,000.\r\n\r\n       This loan remained unpaid at the time of the Syndicate's\r\n       failure. The stock of the Fresno Publishing Company sold under\r\n       the hammer for $4,850. The 1251 shares of the Sacramento\r\n       Publishing Company were estimated to be worth $51,000. The\r\n       stock of the Calkins Publishing House was of doubtful value.\r\n       The Union Trust Company, before the failure, released the Globe\r\n       bonds without payment of the note or consideration of other\r\n       security. This left the stock of the Sacramento Publishing\r\n       Company, valued at perhaps $51,000, as sure security for the\r\n       $175,000 loan.\r\n\r\n       But this stock was curiously involved. The entire stock of the\r\n       company consisted of 2500 shares of a par value of $100 a\r\n       share. The corporation's property consisted of the Sacramento\r\n       Union newspaper and the real property where the paper was\r\n       published.\r\n\r\n       Soon after purchasing the Sacramento stock, the Calkins\r\n       Syndicate organized a second Sacramento Publishing Company. The\r\n       first company--that of the 2500 shares--was organized as The\r\n       Sacramento Publishing Company. The Calkins people in organizing\r\n       the second company dropped the \"The,\" calling it \"Sacramento\r\n       Publishing Company.\" The second company was organized with a\r\n       capital stock of 300,000 shares,--175,000 shares common stock\r\n       and 125,000 shares preferred.\r\n\r\n       The Syndicate took 100,000 shares of this preferred stock to\r\n       the London, Paris and American Bank, and used it with certain\r\n       stock of the Nevada County Publishing Company, another Calkins\r\n       concern, as collateral to secure a loan of $30,000. Of the\r\n       25,000 (preferred) shares remaining, the Calkins people sold\r\n       10,000 shares for money. The 15,000 shares remaining, Mr.\r\n       Willard P. Calkins, head of the Calkins Syndicate, took to\r\n       compensate him for his peculiar labors in the transaction. This\r\n       disposed of the 125,000 shares of preferred stock in the second\r\n       company.\r\n\r\n       The 175,000 shares of common stock still remained to be\r\n       disposed of. Mr. Calkins, as president of the Calkins\r\n       Syndicate, wanting more money, took the 175,000 shares to the\r\n       London, Paris and American Bank, and pledged them as part\r\n       collateral for a second loan. He did more--he pledged the\r\n       \"Union's\" Associated Press franchise as further security for\r\n       this second loan.\r\n\r\n       Eventually, the second loan was paid off, but the London, Paris\r\n       and American Bank continued to hold the 175,000 shares of\r\n       common stock and the Associated Press franchise, under an\r\n       alleged collateral agreement, as further security for the first\r\n       loan of $30,000. The first loan was eventually reduced to\r\n       $16,085.02. When the crash came, two Sacramento Publishing\r\n       Companies, one with a \"The\" and one without a \"The,\" claimed\r\n       ownership of the Sacramento \"Union.\" A majority of the stock of\r\n       the first company was pledged to the Union Trust Company as\r\n       part collateral for a loan of $175,000; 175,000 shares of the\r\n       common stock of the second company and 100,000 shares of its\r\n       preferred stock, together with the paper's Associated Press\r\n       franchise, were in the hands of the successor of the London,\r\n       Paris and American Bank, the Anglo & London, Paris National\r\n       Bank, to secure a balance of $16,085.02 due on an original loan\r\n       of $30,000.\r\n\r\n       But there were further complications. The first Sacramento\r\n       Publishing Company, the directors and officers of which were\r\n       the directors and officers of the second company, transferred\r\n       the corporation's office building to the second corporation.\r\n       The second corporation thereupon mortgaged this real estate to\r\n       the People's Bank of Sacramento to secure a second loan of\r\n       $20,000.\r\n\r\n       When Mr. I. W. Hellman, Jr., manager of the Union Trust\r\n       Company--also one of the prominent managers of the Hellman\r\n       movement in local politics--was on the witness stand, at the\r\n       time of the Calkins investigation, he was asked to whom he\r\n       looked for the payment of the $175,000.\r\n\r\n       \"To the Calkins Syndicate,\" replied Mr. Hellman.\r\n\r\n [276] The presence of President Calhoun at an Olympic Club dinner in\r\n       July, 1907, met with strong objection. Calhoun was not a\r\n       member of the club. He had, it was charged, been brought there\r\n       by one of the employees of the Southern Pacific Company, who\r\n       was a member. His appearance led to open protest. It was\r\n       finally arranged that objection should not be made to him, on\r\n       condition that he would not attempt to make an address. But\r\n       the defense claque had evidently planned otherwise. A\r\n       demonstration was started for Calhoun. He began a speech which\r\n       brought members to their feet in protest.\r\n\r\n       \"I object,\" said Dr. Charles A. Clinton, one of the oldest\r\n       members of the club, \"to the presence here of Mr. Calhoun and\r\n       I protest against his making a speech on the ground that the\r\n       gentleman has been indicted by the Grand Jury for a most\r\n       heinous offense; that he has been charged with bribing and\r\n       debauching public officials, and should not be a guest of the\r\n       club until he can come with clean hands. I do not pass upon\r\n       this man's innocence or guilt, but feel that until his hands\r\n       are clean he should not come to the club.\"\r\n\r\n       The outcome was that, by action of the Board of Directors, Dr.\r\n       Clinton was expelled from the club. The course was generally\r\n       denounced. \"The Olympic Club of San Francisco,\" said the\r\n       Sacramento Bee, \"has shamed itself in the eyes of every decent,\r\n       honest, manly, self-respecting citizen in this State by its\r\n       recent act, through its Board of Directors, in expelling Dr.\r\n       Charles A. Clinton from membership. The offense of Dr. Clinton\r\n       was merely that he protested, as every other honorable member\r\n       of the Olympic Club should have protested, not so much against\r\n       the plotted appearance in that club at a banquet, of Patrick\r\n       Calhoun, indicted for high crimes, as against the subsequent\r\n       effort on the part of some members of the Olympic Club to force\r\n       Calhoun to make a speech and become the hero of the affair.\"\r\n\r\n       When the American battleship fleet visited San Francisco in\r\n       1908, much opposition developed over the efforts of upholders\r\n       of the defense to have Calhoun invited to the banquet given in\r\n       honor of the visitors. Calhoun's representatives finally\r\n       overcame the resistance, and Calhoun was invited.\r\n\r\n       Calhoun's social and other activities during this period\r\n       resulted in much newspaper discussion. \"The action of Patrick\r\n       Calhoun,\" said the Examiner, \"in appointing himself, Thornwell\r\n       Mullally and William Abbott, all under indictment on bribery\r\n       charges, as delegates to the Industrial Peace Conference caused\r\n       such indignation and protest on the part of the other delegates\r\n       that a committee on arrangements last evening demanded that\r\n       Calhoun withdraw the names of himself and his two subordinates\r\n       and substitute others.\" Mrs. Eleanor Martin gave a dinner in\r\n       honor of Congressman and Mrs. Nicholas Longworth on the\r\n       occasion of the visit of President Roosevelt's daughter to San\r\n       Francisco. Mrs. Martin ranked as highest of San Francisco's\r\n       so-called social leaders. The alleged fact that neither Calhoun\r\n       nor Mullally was present on that important occasion was made\r\n       subject of much curious newspaper comment. The \"social side\" of\r\n       the graft defense not infrequently furnished saving comedy for\r\n       an overstrained situation. It was, however, most effective in\r\n       breaking down the prosecution. \"Socially\" the defense had\r\n       decidedly the better of the situation. Calhoun, for example,\r\n       became a member of the Olympic Club. There was a deal of\r\n       newspaper protest at the club's action in admitting him, and\r\n       defense of the club and other comedy. But Calhoun wore the\r\n       \"winged O\" emblem of the Olympic Club on his automobile,\r\n       nevertheless.\r\n\r\n [277] One of the most amusing experiences which the writer had\r\n       during this period was in listening to a woman, prominent in\r\n       Episcopalian Church affairs, as she voiced her indignation\r\n       because of a slight put upon her at an important social event\r\n       of her church, at which daughters of one of the graft\r\n       defendants had place in the receiving line.\r\n\r\n [278] Some of the letters of refusal to contribute are of curious\r\n       interest. For example, Timothy Hopkins, a capitalist of large\r\n       affairs, wrote curtly: \"Yours of the 4th in reference to\r\n       contributions for the entertainment of the United States Fleet\r\n       has been received. I am not contributing. Yours truly, TIMOTHY\r\n       HOPKINS.\"\r\n\r\n       E. E. Calvin, for the Southern Pacific, wrote \"that under\r\n       present conditions we cannot afford to contribute money to any\r\n       purpose other than charity or a pressing public necessity.\"\r\n\r\n       A. H. Payson, for the Santa Fe, wrote that under his\r\n       instructions he \"was not able to make a subscription for this\r\n       purpose in behalf of the Atchison Company.\"\r\n\r\n [279] Mr. Ralston, in an interview printed in the San Francisco\r\n       Examiner, September 26, 1908, said of this incident:\r\n\r\n       \"The true facts of the case are that when P. N. Lilienthal and\r\n       myself called on many of the banks and all of the public\r\n       utility corporations they came out boldly and stated that they\r\n       would not give one dollar while Phelan was Chairman of the\r\n       Executive Committee, or connected with the reception of the\r\n       fleet.\r\n\r\n       \"Some of the banks that refused are the Crocker National Bank\r\n       and the Wells-Fargo National. Some of the other banks only gave\r\n       $100 when they would have given much larger amounts. They\r\n       disliked Phelan. Among the corporations were the Telephone\r\n       Company, the Spring Valley Water Company, and the Gas and\r\n       Electric Light Company. The Southern Pacific and Santa Fe\r\n       refused to subscribe and it is presumed their reasons were the\r\n       same as the other corporations.\r\n\r\n       \"When I learned the true situation,\" Mr. Ralston went on, as he\r\n       widened the mouth of the bag for the certain escape of the cat,\r\n       \"I went before the Executive Committee, at a meeting at which\r\n       Mr. Phelan was present, and guaranteed the sum of $25,000 more\r\n       if Mr. Phelan resign or step out. I even went further and said\r\n       that besides guaranteeing $25,000, I felt assured that the sum\r\n       of $50,000 could be easily collected if Mr. Phelan would drop\r\n       out. This Mr. Phelan refused to do. These matters all came up\r\n       in executive meetings.\"\r\n\r\n       In this connection it is interesting to note that at the 1914\r\n       election in California, Mr. Phelan was elected to represent the\r\n       State in the United States Senate, while Mr. Ralston was\r\n       defeated at the Republican primaries for nomination for\r\n       Governor.\r\n\r\n [280] See Chapter III.\r\n\r\n [281] President Calhoun's denunciation of Heney was scarcely\r\n       consistent with the high regard in which Heney was at the\r\n       opening of the prosecution, held by the United Railroads'\r\n       executives. So well did they think of Heney that they selected\r\n       him to sit on the Board of Arbitration which met late in 1906\r\n       to adjust differences between the United Railroads and its\r\n       employees. This fact was given by Acting Mayor Gallagher as\r\n       one of the reasons for removing Langdon from office, in\r\n       October, 1906, when the Graft Prosecution opened.\r\n       Specification 7 of Gallagher's order removing Langdon because\r\n       of the appointment of Heney reads: \"Specification 7, That said\r\n       Francis J. Heney at and prior to the time of his appointment\r\n       as assistant district attorney was the representative of the\r\n       corporation controlling the street-car system of said city and\r\n       county (The United Railroads), in a certain dispute between\r\n       said corporation and its employees. That the appointment of\r\n       said Heney to said office will, in regard to the enforcement\r\n       of law against said corporation, be prejudicial and\r\n       detrimental to the interests of said city and county.\"\r\n\r\n       Heney resigned his position as arbitrator in the United\r\n       Railroads controversy soon after the prosecution opened.\r\n\r\n [282] The graft defendants sent men to Arizona to have Heney\r\n       indicted, charging murder of a Dr. Handy. Years before, Heney\r\n       had taken the case of Handy's wife in divorce proceedings,\r\n       after other attorneys had declined it because of fear of\r\n       Handy. Handy had boasted that he would kill the man who took\r\n       his wife's case. After Heney had agreed to represent Mrs.\r\n       Handy, Handy announced that he would kill Heney with Heney's\r\n       own gun. He actually attempted this, and Heney, in\r\n       self-defense, shot him. Heney was exonerated at the time. When\r\n       the graft trials opened, first representatives of Ruef, and\r\n       then representatives of the United Railroads went to Arizona\r\n       for the purpose of working up this case against Heney, and if\r\n       possible secure his indictment for murder. Ruef's\r\n       representatives even went so far as to attempt to secure the\r\n       services of Handy's son to get Heney indicted. Young Handy\r\n       went to Heney, told him what was going on, and offered to go\r\n       to Arizona to protect Heney. But Heney declined to permit this\r\n       sacrifice. Young Handy expressed gratitude for what Heney had\r\n       done for his mother. Heney's brother, Ben Heney, with full\r\n       knowledge of what was going on, watched the efforts of those\r\n       who were endeavoring to make this case, long since disposed\r\n       of, a matter of embarrassment to the prosecutor. As the graft\r\n       defense investigators found nothing upon which to base a\r\n       charge this move against the graft prosecution failed.\r\n\r\n [283] Dean John H. Wigmore of the Northwestern School of Law at\r\n       Chicago, author of Wigmore on Evidence, made sharp reply to\r\n       this contention. In a letter to President Calhoun, dated\r\n       August 10, 1909, Dean Wigmore said:\r\n\r\n                         \"Chicago, 87 Lake Street, 10 August, 1909.\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Patrick Calhoun, San Francisco.\r\n\r\n       \"Sir:--Recently there arrived in my hands by mail, with no\r\n       sender's address, a pamphlet of ninety pages, entitled 'Some\r\n       Facts Regarding Francis J. Heney.' On page 12 your name\r\n       appears as a printed signature. I am assuming that you caused\r\n       the contents to be prepared and mailed.\r\n\r\n       \"The pamphlet contains assertions reflecting on the conduct of\r\n       Francis J. Heney and the Federal Department of Justice, in\r\n       taking part in the prosecution of a criminal charge of bribery\r\n       in the State Court of California against yourself. The pamphlet\r\n       contains no defense of yourself; it does not even mention your\r\n       name, except as its signer and in the title of exhibits; much\r\n       less does it allege or attempt to show your innocence. It\r\n       merely asks an answer to 'three important constitutional and\r\n       moral questions' affecting Mr. Heney and the Department of\r\n       Justice.\r\n\r\n       \"Before answering those questions, let me say that this does\r\n       not appear to be the method of an innocent man. The public\r\n       press has made notorious the charge against you and its\r\n       prosecution by Mr. Heney. Thoughtful citizens everywhere have\r\n       discussed it. Many (not including myself) had assumed that you\r\n       were guilty. You now appear to have spent a large sum to print\r\n       and circulate widely a pamphlet concerning the case. Anyone\r\n       would expect to find the pamphlet devoted to showing your\r\n       innocence; and thus to removing unfavorable opinions based on\r\n       casual press dispatches. An honest man, desiring to stand well\r\n       with honest fellow-citizens, and possessing means to print,\r\n       would naturally take that course. You do not. Your pamphlet\r\n       merely attacks the technical authority of one of the attorneys\r\n       for the prosecution, incidentally abusing two judges. This is\r\n       not the course of an innocent man. It is the course of a guilty\r\n       man who desires to divert the attention of the tribunal of\r\n       public opinion. The tradition is here fulfilled of the\r\n       attorney's instructions to the barrister acting for his guilty\r\n       client, 'No case; abuse the opposing counsel.' I am compelled\r\n       now to assume that you have no case, because all that your\r\n       expensive pamphlet does is to abuse one of the counsel for the\r\n       prosecution. Until now I have supposed it proper to suspend\r\n       judgment. I do so no longer.\r\n\r\n       \"And what are your three 'constitutional and moral'\r\n       questions,--since you have sent me a pamphlet asking an answer\r\n       to them? I will answer them frankly.\r\n\r\n       \"1. Was Mr. Heney's payment by the Department of Justice\r\n       covertly for the California prosecution but nominally for other\r\n       and Federal services?\r\n\r\n       \"Answer: I do not know. But I and other honest citizens will\r\n       presume in favor of the honesty, in this act, of a President,\r\n       an Attorney-General, and an Assistant Attorney-General who\r\n       proved in all other public acts that they were honest and\r\n       courageous beyond example, especially as against a man like\r\n       yourself who publishes a pamphlet based throughout on anonymous\r\n       assertions.\r\n\r\n       \"2. Can a Federal Assistant Attorney-General, under Federal\r\n       salary, lawfully act at the same time as State Assistant\r\n       District Attorney?\r\n\r\n       \"Answer: As to this 'constitutional' question, I leave this to\r\n       the courts, as you should. As to this 'moral' question, I say\r\n       that it is moral for any Federal officer to help any State\r\n       officer in the pursuit of crime, and that only guilty\r\n       lawbreakers could be imagined to desire the contrary.\r\n\r\n       \"3. Can a private citizen contribute money to help the State's\r\n       prosecuting officers in the investigation and trial of a\r\n       criminal charge?\r\n\r\n       \"Answer: He can; and it is stupid even to put the question.\r\n       Under the original English jury-system (of which you received\r\n       the benefit) and until the last century, the private citizen\r\n       was usually obliged to pay the prosecuting expenses; for the\r\n       State did not, and crime went unpunished otherwise. If\r\n       nowadays, in any community, crime is again likely to go\r\n       unpunished without the help of private citizens, there is no\r\n       reason why we should not revert to the old system. As for Mr.\r\n       Spreckels (the private citizen here named by you), his name\r\n       should be held in honor, and will ever be, as against anything\r\n       your pamphlet can say. As for Mr. Heney and his receipt of\r\n       $47,500 officially and 'large sums of money additionally' from\r\n       Mr. Spreckels, it may be presumed that he spent most of it on\r\n       trial expenses, and did not keep it as a personal reward. But\r\n       even if he did so keep it, let me register the view that he is\r\n       welcome to all this--and to more--if anybody will give it; that\r\n       no money compensation is too high for such rare courage; that\r\n       the moral courage displayed by him is as much entitled to high\r\n       money compensation as the unprincipled commercial skill\r\n       displayed by yourself--and this solely by the economic test of\r\n       money value,--viz., demand and supply.\r\n\r\n       \"Apart from this, the high sums said to have been paid by you\r\n       to Abraham Ruef solely for his legal skill estop you from\r\n       questioning the propriety of lesser sums said to have been paid\r\n       to Francis J. Heney for his legal skill.\r\n\r\n       \"Just twenty-five years ago I sat in an upper room on Kearny\r\n       street, with five other young men, and helped to organize a\r\n       Municipal Reform League. Two or three others, still living,\r\n       will recall the occasion. Abraham Ruef was one of them.\r\n\r\n       \"Fate separated all of us within a short time. Ruef went his\r\n       own way,--the way we all know. It is the memory of those\r\n       earlier days, in contrast with the recent course of events in\r\n       my old home, that has interested me to give you these answers\r\n       to the questions asked in the pamphlet you purport to have sent\r\n       me.\r\n                                                  \"JOHN H. WIGMORE.\"\r\n\r\n [284] See Rudolph Spreckels' testimony in The People, etc., vs.\r\n       Patrick Calhoun.\r\n\r\n [285] As early as April 20, 1907, the Chronicle began its objection\r\n       to Ruef's confinement. The Chronicle on that date said, in an\r\n       editorial article:\r\n\r\n       \"It appears that it is costing the city about $70 a day to\r\n       keep Ruef in jail. That expense should be shut off and shut\r\n       off now. There is no reason why Ruef should be treated\r\n       differently from any other criminal who jumped his bail.\r\n       Incidentally the public is getting impatient to hear that the\r\n       $50,000 bail already forfeited has been collected. If that\r\n       were in the treasury we should be more willing to incur this\r\n       large expense. The public will very sharply criticise\r\n       authorities who incur such expense for the care of Ruef\r\n       without promptly collecting the forfeited bail or beginning\r\n       suit for it. Perhaps it has already been collected and the\r\n       public has not heard of it.\r\n\r\n       \"The city has provided a jail and a jailer. Let him have Ruef.\r\n       Of course, he will 'connubiate' with him, but what of it? The\r\n       Sheriff will be under the direction of the Court and if, when\r\n       otherwise ordered, he grants Ruef privileges not proper, he\r\n       can himself be put in jail, we suppose. We trust the trial\r\n       judges will not be discouraged in their efforts to enforce\r\n       respect to their courts. They will find the people behind them\r\n       who are already sitting in critical judgment on the legal\r\n       refinements of the higher courts.\r\n\r\n       \"We suppose that a criminal who has once jumped his bail may be\r\n       kept in jail when caught. But we see no use of it. By once\r\n       running away he has warranted the Court in fixing new bail at\r\n       such a rate that the public would gladly have it forfeited. We\r\n       could afford to pay something handsome to clear Ruef entirely\r\n       out of the country and into Honduras, and if we could extort\r\n       from him a few hundred thousand dollars for the privilege it\r\n       would be the best trade we ever made. But we do not believe he\r\n       would run away if the bail were made right. But if he is not to\r\n       be bailed, let him go to jail, where the total cost of his keep\r\n       will not exceed 25 or 30 cents a day or whatever it is. And if\r\n       the Sheriff is not trustworthy--as, of course, he is not--let\r\n       Elisor Biggy have a key to a separate lock on his dungeon. But\r\n       there is no sense in spending $70 a day for the keep of only\r\n       one of our municipal reprobates.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n                   THE GLASS TRIALS AND CONVICTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day that Mayor Schmitz was sentenced to serve five years in the\r\npenitentiary for extortion, six jurors were secured to try Louis Glass,\r\nfor bribery.\r\n\r\nMr. Glass had been indicted with T. V. Halsey for alleged bribery\r\ntransactions growing out of the opposition of the Pacific States\r\nTelephone and Telegraph Company to competition in the San Francisco\r\nfield. Mr. Halsey's business was to watch, and, so far as lay in his\r\npower, to block, such opposition telephone companies as might seek\r\nentrance into San Francisco.\r\n\r\nMr. Glass was Mr. Halsey's superior. To Glass, Halsey reported, and from\r\nGlass, Halsey took his orders. Eleven Supervisors had confessed that\r\nHalsey had paid them large sums to oppose the granting of a franchise to\r\nthe Home Telephone Company. Testimony given before the Grand Jury had\r\nbrought the source of the bribe money close to Halsey's superior, Glass.\r\n\r\nGlass was indicted. The specific charge on which he was brought to trial\r\nwas that he had given Supervisor Charles Boxton a bribe of $5000.\r\n\r\nAs in all the graft cases, there had been in Mr. Glass's defense\r\ntechnical attack upon the validity of the Grand Jury, demurrers, and\r\nother delaying moves. But point by point the prosecution had beaten down\r\nopposition, and by the time the Schmitz extortion case had been disposed\r\nof, District Attorney Langdon and his associates were able to proceed\r\nwith the trial of Glass.[286]\r\n\r\nThe District Attorney's office was represented by Heney. D. M. Delmas\r\nand T. C. Coogan appeared for Mr. Glass.\r\n\r\nThere were none of the difficulties in securing the jury, as were\r\nexperienced in the later graft trials. The Glass jury was sworn two days\r\nafter the trial opened.\r\n\r\nDr. Boxton took the stand and testified, with a minutia of detail, how\r\nthe bribe had been paid to him. Dr. Boxton was the first of the\r\nSupervisors to testify before trial jury and public, of his corruption.\r\nDuring the next year and a half San Francisco was to hear the story\r\nrepeated time after time from the lips of sixteen men who had occupied\r\nthe supervisorial office. But Boxton was the first. The spectacle of a\r\nman testifying that he had taken bribes and betrayed the city was new;\r\nit was astonishing, thrilling with sensation.\r\n\r\nBoxton's position was emphasized by his elevation, on the day of the\r\nbeginning of his testimony, to the mayoralty office. He was spared by\r\nneither prosecution nor defense. He was kept on the witness stand for\r\nhours. The prosecution treated him with coldness, making no attempt to\r\npalliate or excuse his conduct. The defense harassed him with subtle\r\nridicule.\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of Boxton's examination, the Board of\r\nSupervisors was in session. As Mayor of San Francisco, Boxton was\r\nsupposed to preside over the Board. He was repeatedly dragged from\r\npresiding desk to witness stand, and hustled back from witness stand to\r\npresiding desk, the whole city watching every move.\r\n\r\n\"You were elected Mayor of this city?\" inquired Delmas after one of the\r\nwitness' shameful admissions.\r\n\r\n\"Through no fault of mine,\" replied Boxton wearily.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the ridicule and the hammering, Boxton testified\r\npositively to receiving money from Halsey to influence him against\r\ncasting his supervisorial vote to give the Home Telephone Company a\r\nfranchise. That Halsey paid the money was not seriously disputed. The\r\nquestion raised by the defense was, did the bribe money necessarily come\r\nthrough Halsey's superior, Glass?\r\n\r\nThis question the prosecution attempted to meet. Halsey, it was shown,\r\nwas employed under Glass in an inferior position and had neither\r\nauthority nor power to use the corporation's funds without\r\nauthorization.\r\n\r\nMr. Glass's position in the company was an important one. He had long\r\nbeen vice-president and general manager. After the death of John I.\r\nSabin, president of the company, in October, 1905, Glass became acting\r\npresident, a position which he held until Henry T. Scott assumed the\r\nduties of that office late in February, or early in March, 1906. The\r\nevidence went to show that at the time of the alleged bribery\r\ntransactions, Glass was serving as general manager and acting president.\r\nOfficials of the company testified that during Sabin's administration\r\nchecks had been signed by \"John I. Sabin by Zimmer,\" or \"E. J. Zimmer\r\nfor the president,\" and countersigned by the treasurer. Zimmer was\r\nSabin's confidential clerk.\r\n\r\nDuring Mr. Glass's administration, after Mr. Sabin's death, up to the\r\ntime that Mr. Scott took hold, the checks were signed by Mr. Glass, or\r\nMr. Zimmer for Mr. Glass, bearing as well the treasurer's signature.\r\n\r\nZimmer had testified before the Grand Jury that at the direction of Mr.\r\nGlass, he had drawn large sums in currency from the banks, and given the\r\nmoney to Halsey. Halsey[287] gave no vouchers for this money which he\r\nreceived from Zimmer. The amounts were accounted for at the company's\r\noffice by tags in the cash drawer.\r\n\r\nThe testimony which Zimmer had given before the Grand Jury connected\r\nGlass directly with the large amounts which Halsey, without giving\r\nvouchers, had received from the telephone company's treasury at the time\r\nof the bribery transactions. The prosecution depended upon Zimmer's\r\ntestimony to solidify their case. But when Zimmer was called to the\r\nstand, he refused to testify.\r\n\r\nZimmer based his refusal upon the ground that in his opinion the Grand\r\nJury had indicted a number of gentlemen upon evidence which Mr. Zimmer\r\nregarded as insufficient, and that he would not, to protect his own\r\ninterests, testify.[288]\r\n\r\nThe court instructed Mr. Zimmer that his position was untenable. The\r\nwitness continued obdurate. The court sentenced him to serve five days\r\nin the county jail for contempt.\r\n\r\nAfter his five-days' term had expired, Zimmer was again called to the\r\nstand, and again did he refuse to testify; again was he sentenced to\r\nserve in the county jail, this time for one day. Upon the expiration of\r\nthis second sentence, Zimmer was for the third time called to the stand,\r\nfor the third time refused to testify. For the third time was he\r\nadjudged guilty of contempt. His third sentence was to serve five days\r\nin the county jail and pay a fine of $500. Before he had served his\r\ntime, the Glass trial had been concluded. Zimmer, therefore, escaped\r\ntestifying against his associate, Glass. But for his refusal, he served\r\neleven days in the county jail and paid a fine of $500. The maximum\r\npenalty for the crime of bribery alleged against Glass was fourteen\r\nyears penal servitude. Mr. Zimmer thus served fewer days than Mr. Glass\r\nmight have been sentenced to serve years had he been convicted. The\r\ntestimony which Zimmer[289] gave before the Grand Jury, was not\r\npresented to the trial jury.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the prosecution considered that it had made out a strong\r\ncase, but Mr. Heney and his associates had reckoned without D. M. Delmas,\r\nGlass's chief counsel. The defense introduced no evidence, but Delmas,\r\nin a masterful argument, raised the question of reasonable doubt. He\r\ninsisted that Glass had not necessarily given the money to Halsey. He\r\nargued that several others of the officials of the company could have\r\nauthorized the transaction. By an elaborate chain of reasoning, for\r\nexample, Delmas insisted that if the money had been given Halsey at all,\r\nPresident Henry T. Scott[290] could have provided for it.\r\n\r\nThe jury, after being out forty-seven hours, failed to agree. At the\r\nfinal ballot it stood seven for conviction and five for acquittal. That\r\nDelmas's argument had strong influence upon those who voted for\r\nacquittal was indicated by their published interviews. If these\r\nstatements are to be credited, Glass escaped conviction because a number\r\nof the jurors held to the opinion that some telephone company official\r\nother than Glass could have authorized the passing of the bribe\r\nmoney.[291]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the prosecution could bring Glass to second trial, impaneling\r\nof the jury began.[292] Glass, at this second trial, was tried for the\r\nalleged bribery of Supervisor Lonergan. The trial was in many\r\nparticulars a repetition of the first. Again, there was no serious\r\nattempt to dispute that Halsey had paid Lonergan the bribe money. Zimmer\r\nagain refused to testify against his superior, and was again committed\r\nfor contempt. But the prosecution was careful at the second trial to\r\nshow beyond the possibility of the question of a doubt that neither\r\nPresident Henry T. Scott, nor any other official of the Pacific States\r\nTelephone Company, other than Glass, could have authorized the payment\r\nof the bribe money.\r\n\r\nBy the minute books of the corporation, the prosecution showed that\r\nchecks drawn by the corporation on San Francisco banks were to be signed\r\n\"by the assistant treasurer or his deputy, and by the president, or his\r\nprivate secretary, E. J. Zimmer, for him, or by the general manager.\" As\r\nfor Mr. Scott, the prosecution showed by the testimony of Assistant\r\nTreasurer Eaton[293] of the telephone company that the corporation did\r\nnot notify the banks to honor President Scott's signature until February\r\n27, which was after the alleged bribery of Supervisor Lonergan had been\r\nconsummated.\r\n\r\nThe jury, after being out less than a half hour, brought in a verdict of\r\nguilty.\r\n\r\nPending his appeal to the Appellate Court, Glass was confined in the\r\ncounty jail.\r\n\r\nOf the Pacific States Telephone bribing charges, those against T. V.\r\nHalsey remained to be disposed of.\r\n\r\nEven while the second Glass trial was under way, Halsey's trial for the\r\nbribery of Supervisor Lonergan was begun. There had been the same\r\ndelaying tactics to ward off appearance before a jury which had\r\ncharacterized the other graft cases. The impaneling of the trial jury\r\nwas, however, finally undertaken. But the proceedings were suddenly\r\nbrought to a close. Halsey, after eight jurors had been secured to try\r\nhim, was stricken with appendicitis.\r\n\r\nOn this showing, his trial was postponed. Later on, Mr. Halsey was\r\nthreatened with tuberculosis, which further delayed proceedings against\r\nhim. Until after the defeat of the Graft Prosecution in 1909, Mr.\r\nHalsey's health did not permit of his being tried. His trials under the\r\nnew administration of the District Attorney's office, resulted in\r\nacquittals.\r\n\r\nMr. Halsey, in August, 1913, still survives both the appendicitis attack\r\nand the threatened tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [286] Glass's attorneys contended to the last moment that the trial\r\n       judge had no jurisdiction to hear the case. After the District\r\n       Attorney's opening statement had been made, but before the\r\n       taking of testimony had begun, Mr. Delmas for the defense,\r\n       stated that in the opinion of the counsel for the defendant\r\n       the court had no jurisdiction to try the case on the ground\r\n       that the Grand Jury which returned the purported indictment\r\n       was an illegal body, having no power to sit as a grand jury at\r\n       the time it returned the indictment.\r\n\r\n [287] See Chapter XIV and footnotes 189 and 190, page 171.\r\n\r\n [288] Mr. Zimmer's statement to the court was as follows: \"As\r\n       previously stated, the Grand Jury has heretofore charged and\r\n       indicted a number of gentlemen on evidence which I have read,\r\n       and which seems to be insufficient, for which reason I have\r\n       taken this stand to protect my own interests; the stand I\r\n       refer to is not to testify in the case which I had intended\r\n       and not knowing my rights in the matter. I was sworn, though\r\n       my intention was not to be sworn.\" Zimmer positively refused\r\n       to place his declination on the ground that his testimony\r\n       might tend to subject him to prosecution.\r\n\r\n [289] Zimmer was later tried before a Justice of Peace for contempt,\r\n       found guilty and sentenced to three months in the county Jail.\r\n       He appealed to the higher courts.\r\n\r\n [290] Scott had been elected President before the alleged bribery\r\n       transactions, but had left soon after for the East. The\r\n       Prosecution held that Scott did not assume his duties as\r\n       president until after his return from the East, when the\r\n       alleged briberies had been completed. Delmas concluded his\r\n       argument on Scott's possible responsibility as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"And then you are called again further on in this same process\r\n       of elimination. 'We expect to prove to you that Halsey had no\r\n       power to expend moneys without a voucher, and that no person\r\n       at that time in the Telephone Company had any power to expend\r\n       money without the approval of the executive Board of\r\n       Directors, except Glass, and Scott, who was away.' Scott had\r\n       gone, we were told, on the 18th or 19th. These transactions\r\n       took place on the 22d, 23d and 24th. Scott could not have\r\n       authorized them from the simple fact that Scott was then in\r\n       the East, and he was not here in San Francisco to direct or\r\n       authorize the management of the affairs of this corporation. A\r\n       true elimination, gentlemen, if the facts were true, but the\r\n       facts are not true. Mr. Scott did not leave for the East--bear\r\n       this in mind--Mr. Scott did not leave for the East until all\r\n       these transactions were closed; he did not leave until the\r\n       27th of February when the last of these checks had been paid.\r\n       Who drew it? Scott himself. I challenge contradiction. The\r\n       Assistant District Attorney told you on the first day that he\r\n       addressed you that Scott left on the 18th or 19th. Did he know\r\n       that Scott did not leave until the 27th? Did he? If he did,\r\n       then there are no words that would apply to the deception that\r\n       was sought to be practiced upon you, and I do not charge any\r\n       such deception. Had Mr. Scott informed the District Attorney\r\n       that he left on the 18th or 19th? I do not know. There is no\r\n       evidence before you that he had. How, then, did he get the\r\n       idea which he made to you under the oath of his office as\r\n       District Attorney that Scott left on the 18th or 19th, when in\r\n       point of fact Scott did not leave until the 27th? He came back\r\n       from Portland on Monday or Tuesday of the preceding week. He\r\n       was here during the whole of these transactions; he remained\r\n       until the last check had been paid. He remained until the\r\n       ordinance had been passed on the 26th of February, and left\r\n       the defeated camp on the next day. How, then, upon that\r\n       evidence, is Scott eliminated from this transaction? And I do\r\n       not want you to understand that I am charging Mr. Scott with\r\n       crime. That is no part of my business. It is no part of my\r\n       office. I am assuming, upon the theory of this prosecution,\r\n       that a crime was committed, and I say you, yourselves, Mr.\r\n       District Attorney and your attendants, have undertaken by the\r\n       process of elimination which you have selected, to show us\r\n       that Mr. Scott could not have committed this crime. It is\r\n       sufficient for us to show you that he could without charging\r\n       that he did.\"\r\n\r\n [291] The following are taken from interviews with the several\r\n       jurors which appeared in the Examiner of July 29, 1907:\r\n\r\n       Juror Jacob Wertheimer--\"I voted as I did (for acquittal)\r\n       because there was a reasonable doubt in my mind as to whether\r\n       or not Glass had authorized the giving of the money. There\r\n       were too many others that might have been the ones.\"\r\n\r\n       Juror Charles P. Fonda--\"I voted not guilty. It was simply a\r\n       question of whether Glass paid over this money as charged.\r\n       Five of us did not believe that the Prosecution produced\r\n       sufficiently convincing evidence to find the defendant\r\n       guilty.\"\r\n\r\n       Juror Michael C. Samuels--\"The evidence did not link Glass up.\r\n       So far as the bribery went, it might have been done by another\r\n       official of the company than Glass.\"\r\n\r\n       Juror Hugo Schnessel--\"There was always something lacking in\r\n       the evidence to convince me beyond a reasonable doubt of the\r\n       defendant's guilt. It seemed to me that possibly some one else\r\n       other than Glass might have paid over the money.\"\r\n\r\n [292] Of the delaying tactics in the Glass case, The San Francisco\r\n       Call in its issue of August 14, 1907, said:\r\n\r\n       \"Anything to delay trial and judgment is the policy of the\r\n       accused bribe givers. Every day's proceedings in the retrial\r\n       of Glass provides ample proof to convince the most skeptical\r\n       citizen that the last thing desired by the men charged with\r\n       debauching the boodle Board of Supervisors is prompt\r\n       determination of the issues on their merits, and every\r\n       pettifogging move for delay, every cunning attempt to betray\r\n       the court into technical error is confession of a case too\r\n       weak to be given to a fair jury on a plain showing of the\r\n       facts. The attitude of the lawyers for Glass is sufficient to\r\n       indicate that he needs lawyers of their peculiar\r\n       expertness--'distinguished attorneys,' Heney calls\r\n       them--'distinguished for their ability to defeat justice.'\r\n\r\n       \"Judge Lawlor's unhesitating denial of a motion to permit the\r\n       lawyers for Glass to shift their ground in the midst of the\r\n       impaneling of the jury and hark back to an attack on the\r\n       validity of the indictments, and his sharp reprimand to\r\n       Attorney Coogan for his method of misleading talesmen by\r\n       adroitly framed questions, ought to expedite this trial.\r\n       Lawlor has a reputation for dealing sternly with legal\r\n       tricksters and for compelling counsel in the cases that he\r\n       hears to get down to business and keep at it. At the same time\r\n       his record on the bench is that of a just judge and always\r\n       impartial. It is because he is impartial and stern that\r\n       crooked lawyers, with crooked clients, deem it 'hard luck'\r\n       when their cases are assigned to Lawlor.\r\n\r\n       \"Now Judge Lawlor has a rare opportunity to prove anew his\r\n       worth as a jurist. He will please a patient and long suffering\r\n       public and will satisfy the ends of the justice which he\r\n       administers when he makes the lawyers quit trifling and forces\r\n       them to let the trial go on. We may expect to see the trial\r\n       made as tedious and as costly in time and money as high priced\r\n       counselors can arrange. It is all part of the game--tire out\r\n       the public, the jury and the prosecution; delay is the safest\r\n       course for the man accused against whom the people's case is\r\n       strong. But we may also expect to see Judge Lawlor trimming the\r\n       matter of technicalities and pressing it to a conclusion. It\r\n       was because the people had come to expect such things from\r\n       Judge Lawlor that they re-elected him, when all the machines of\r\n       municipal corruption were grinding against him.\"\r\n\r\n [293] Eaton testified at the second Glass trial as follows: \"Mr.\r\n       Scott did not sign any checks between February 8, 1906, and\r\n       the latter part of March, 1906, for the company; not to my\r\n       knowledge. Notices were sent out by me to the different banks\r\n       in regard to the signatures that could be accepted upon checks\r\n       after Mr. Scott was elected president. They were sent on the\r\n       27th of February, 1906, to all the San Francisco banks that we\r\n       had an account with.\"\r\n\r\n       Eaton testified further that the day the banks were notified,\r\n       Mr. Scott went East. Mr. Scott could, Eaton said, previous to\r\n       that date, have signed checks, but up to that time they would\r\n       not have been honored at the banks. Halsey, in the Mills\r\n       Building, gave the Supervisors, of whom Lonergan was one,\r\n       their bribe money not later than February 26. Supervisor\r\n       Lonergan testified that to the best of his recollection he had\r\n       been paid by Halsey some time between February 14 and February\r\n       20.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n                   THE FORD TRIALS AND ACQUITTALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conviction of Glass, following immediately upon the overthrow of the\r\nSchmitz-Ruef municipal administration, and coupled with the pitiful\r\nposition in which, all recognized, Halsey would find himself before a\r\njury, stirred the graft defense to astonishing activity. Although it\r\ndeveloped later that the defendants had had their agents at work even\r\nbefore the bringing of indictments,[294] little was suspected of the\r\nextent of their labors until after the Glass trials. During the trials\r\nof General Tirey L. Ford, who followed Glass before trial jurors,\r\nhowever, the work of the defendants' agents and their methods became\r\nnotorious. From the opening of the Ford trials, the representatives of\r\nthe various graft defendants who congregated in the courtroom ranged in\r\nsocial and professional standing from the highest priced lawyers of the\r\ncharacter of Alexander King, President Calhoun's law partner, down\r\nthrough layers of the typical, criminal lawyer of the Earl Rogers-Porter\r\nAshe[295] grade, to characters of the type of Harry Lorenstzen,[296]\r\nnotoriously known throughout Central California as the \"Banjo-Eyed Kid,\"\r\nand Dave Nagle, the gun-fighter, who numbered among his accomplishments\r\nthe slaying of Judge Terry. Nor were the defending corporations alone\r\nrepresented. The Southern Pacific, although none of its officials were\r\nunder indictment, had men at work in the interest of the defense.[297]\r\n\r\nWith such motley array of attorneys, detectives, gunfighters and agents,\r\nDistrict Attorney Langdon and his associates contended until, what was\r\npractically the ending of the graft prosecution, the defeat of Heney for\r\nDistrict Attorney at the municipal election of 1909.\r\n\r\nFord had been indicted for his alleged part in the bribery of the\r\nSupervisors by the United Railroads to secure its over-head trolley\r\npermit. At his first trial, Ford answered to the charge of bribing\r\nformer Supervisor Lonergan. Lonergan had not been long on the stand\r\nbefore the defense demonstrated the astonishing effectiveness of the\r\nwork of its agents.\r\n\r\nEarl Rogers, for the defendant, on cross-examination, presented a paper\r\nsigned by Lonergan within the month, in which Lonergan set forth that\r\nwhen he voted for the trolley permit he had not been promised, nor did\r\nhe understand, there would be any monetary consideration allowed\r\nhim--nor any other member of the board--for voting in favor of the\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nLonergan had testified on direct examination that some time prior to the\r\ngranting of the permit, Supervisor Wilson had brought word to him there\r\nwould be $8000 for him in the passing of the trolley ordinance. Later\r\nWilson had told him that the amount would be $4000 only. This amount,\r\nLonergan testified, Gallagher had paid him. Lonergan's statement, signed\r\na few days before the opening of the trial, to the effect that when he\r\nvoted to grant the United Railroads its trolley permit no monetary\r\nconsideration had been promised him, came as a surprise to the\r\nprosecution.\r\n\r\nThe story of the manner in which the paper came to be in Rogers's\r\npossession, however, was quite as sensational as the statement itself.\r\nLonergan, the driver of a bakery wagon, confronted by the keenest\r\npractitioners at the California bar, harassed and confused, stammered\r\nout explanation of the manner in which he had been induced to sign the\r\npaper in Rogers's hands.\r\n\r\nLong before he had signed it, one Dorland had secured introduction to\r\nhim. Dorland had represented himself to be a magazine writer, who held\r\nthat the ousted Supervisors had been misused. Dorland stated that his\r\npurpose was to set the Supervisors right in the East. He represented\r\nthat he was to prepare an article on the San Francisco graft situation\r\nfrom an independent, unbiased standpoint. Dorland made himself very\r\nagreeable to Lonergan. He took the unhappy fellow to lunch. He gave him\r\nand members of his family automobile trips and expensive dinners.\r\nLonergan finally signed the statement which the agreeable \"magazine\r\nwriter\" was to use in his behalf, and with which the graft defense[298]\r\nconfronted him on the witness stand.\r\n\r\nThe statement which Lonergan had signed was a rambling account of\r\nconditions in San Francisco, the one pertinent paragraph touching upon\r\nthe United Railroads graft being buried in a multitude of words.\r\n\r\n\"And you intended to say to all the readers of the magazine what you set\r\nforth over your signature there?\" demanded General Ford's attorney.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Lonergan, weakly, \"but when I made that statement I was\r\nnot under oath.\"\r\n\r\nThen Lonergan was confronted with the affidavit which he had signed at\r\nthe opening of the Graft Prosecution when Langdon was fighting against\r\nRuef, Acting Mayor Gallagher and the Schmitz-Ruef Supervisors to keep\r\nhimself in the office of District Attorney and Ruef out. In that\r\naffidavit Lonergan set forth that he had \"never committed a felony of\r\nany kind or character,\" and had \"never been a party thereto.\"[299]\r\n\r\n\"I didn't read that paper at the time I signed it,\" faltered the\r\nmiserable witness. \"I did not consider I was committing a crime when I\r\nsigned that document.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it be a crime to have me sign that,\" he continued in answer to\r\nGeneral Ford's attorney's merciless hammering, \"then I must have\r\n(committed a felony).\"\r\n\r\nThen on re-direct examination Lonergan testified as to how he had come\r\nto sign the affidavit. George B. Keane, clerk of the Board of\r\nSupervisors, Ruef's right-hand man, secretary of the Sunday-night\r\ncaucuses, had, Lonergan testified, said to him, \"Tom, there is a\r\ndocument across the street there for you to go over and sign. All the\r\nboys are signing it.\" Lonergan testified that he had gone over and\r\nsigned it. \"I am almost sure,\" Lonergan continued, \"that some of them\r\nsaid to me that it was a matter of form, merely eulogizing the board.\"\r\n\r\n\"When proper inducements or circumstances occur,\" sneered General Ford's\r\nattorney, \"you will testify falsely concerning your offenses.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not testify falsely on this stand,\" replied the unhappy witness,\r\n\"to whatever has happened during my term as Supervisor.\"\r\n\r\nBut complicated as the position in which the prosecution found its\r\nprincipal witness, it might have been more complicated had all the plans\r\nof the agents for the defense been carried out.\r\n\r\nOn the night before Lonergan was to take the stand against Ford,\r\nDorland, the alleged magazine writer, called him up by telephone and\r\ninvited him \"to make a night of it.\" Dorland stated two women would\r\naccompany them. Before accepting the invitation, Lonergan notified\r\nDetective Burns. Burns instructed him not to go on the trip, but to meet\r\nDorland and to take Mrs. Lonergan with him. Lonergan, with his wife,\r\naccordingly met Dorland and the two women at the appointed place.\r\nDorland expressed his chagrin when he found Lonergan not alone.\r\n\r\n\"He said,\" Lonergan testified, \"he was sorry I was not alone; two nice\r\nyoung ladies were there.\"\r\n\r\nLonergan's testimony of Dorland's dismay when the detective found that\r\nMrs. Lonergan accompanied her husband, was received with amusement. The\r\none-time Supervisor went on no automobile ride that evening. Thus tamely\r\nended what the prosecution insisted was a plot to kidnap, or at least\r\ncompromise, Lonergan on the eve of his appearance as a witness against\r\nGeneral Ford.[300]\r\n\r\nOut of this attempt to involve Lonergan, grew the scarcely less\r\nastonishing kidnaping of Fremont Older, managing editor of the San\r\nFrancisco Bulletin.\r\n\r\nAmong those alleged to have participated in the Lonergan affair was an\r\nemploye of the graft defense by the name of Brown. The defense had at\r\nthe time two employes of that name, \"Luther\" and \"J. C.,\" the latter of\r\nwhom is alleged to have been the one who co-operated with Dorland in his\r\nattempt upon Lonergan. The Bulletin, in its account of the affair,\r\nconfounded Luther with J. C. Brown. Based on the Bulletin's allegations\r\nagainst Luther Brown, warrants were sworn out at Los Angeles, charging\r\nManaging Editor Older with criminal libel. The manner of serving these\r\nLos Angeles warrants was characteristic of the times.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon of September 27, Older, while at Heney's office,\r\nreceived a telephone message that he was wanted at a prominent hotel. As\r\nhe approached the hotel in response to the message, he was stopped by a\r\nnumber of men who claimed to be peace officers from Los Angeles. These\r\ndisplayed the warrant, and hustled Older into an automobile. Older\r\ndemanded that he be taken before a local court. His captors promised him\r\nhe should be. But instead they headed the machine for Redwood City, a\r\ntown some twenty miles south of San Francisco on the line of the\r\nSouthern Pacific. When Older protested a revolver was pressed against\r\nhis side, and he was ordered to keep silent.\r\n\r\nAt Redwood City, Older was put on board a Los Angeles train. On the\r\ntrain were R. Porter Ashe and Luther Brown. Older was not permitted to\r\ncommunicate with his friends nor with the passengers, but was confined\r\nin a stateroom which his captors had secured.[301]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the entire police force of San Francisco was scouring\r\nthe city for the missing man. There had been rumors that those prominent\r\nin the prosecution, Older among them, were to be made away with. Older's\r\nunaccountable disappearance tended to confirm these rumors. His alarmed\r\nfriends were prepared to act promptly when word finally reached them\r\nthat Older was on the southbound train.\r\n\r\nThe train was due to reach Santa Barbara early the following morning.\r\nArrangements were accordingly made to rescue Older at that point. When\r\nthe train arrived there, deputy sheriffs were awaiting its arrival.\r\nOlder was taken into court under habeas corpus proceedings. His release\r\nfollowed,[301] another sensation of the graft defense thereby coming to\r\nsorry ending.[302]\r\n\r\nThere were other surprises for the representatives of the prosecution at\r\nthe Ford trials well calculated to confuse them. Alex. Latham, chauffeur\r\nfor Ruef, whose testimony connected Ruef and Ford, during the period of\r\nthe alleged bribery transactions was, when his name was called as a\r\nwitness, found to be missing. He was alleged to be in Colorado.\r\n\r\nGeorge Starr, treasurer of the United Railroads, whose testimony was\r\nneeded in the tracing of the exact amount of the bribe money paid Ruef\r\nin the overhead trolley deal, $200,000, that had been placed in Ford's\r\nhands under somewhat peculiar circumstances, went East about the date\r\nthe trial opened. The United Railroads' cash book was sent East about\r\nthe same time, and could not be produced at the trial.[303]\r\n\r\nThen again, witnesses who had testified freely before the Grand Jury\r\nbecame forgetful. Supervisor Wilson, who had conveyed word to Lonergan\r\nfrom Gallagher that there would be $4000 in the trolley deal for\r\nLonergan, could, when brought to the witness stand, remember nothing of\r\nthe incident. Supervisor Coffey also proved equally forgetful.[304]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these extraordinary happenings, General Ford's trial\r\nwent on, marked by repeated attacks by attorneys for the defense upon\r\nthose who had been instrumental in bringing about the Graft Prosecution.\r\nRudolph Spreckels in particular, was made object of vicious\r\ndenunciation. It was recognized from the beginning that the defense was\r\nbattling not for General Ford alone, but for President Calhoun, and the\r\nother officials of the United Railroads under indictment.\r\n\r\nThe State's attorneys, target for constant abuse and ridicule at the\r\nhands of the defense, proceeded, however, to present the case of The\r\nPeople. In spite of sensations, the disappearance of witnesses and the\r\nforgetfulness of witnesses, the prosecution brought out testimony to\r\nshow that the Supervisors had received $85,000 for their votes granting\r\nthe trolley permit. By the testimony of officials of the United States\r\nMint it was shown that Patrick Calhoun had, after the fire, but before\r\nthe opening of the San Francisco banks, created a fund of $200,000 at\r\nthe Mint.\r\n\r\nNone of the directors of the United Railroads who could be dragged to\r\nthe stand knew anything about this $200,000. Other amounts, which the\r\nUnited Railroads, during the days of stress following the fire, had\r\nreceived at the Mint from the East, could be accounted for by the books\r\nand vouchers, but not this $200,000.[305] United Railroads employes who\r\ncould be made to testify could throw no light upon its final\r\ndisposition.\r\n\r\nBut the prosecution did show by the Mint officials that President\r\nCalhoun had ordered the $200,000 paid to General Ford and that it was\r\npaid to General Ford.\r\n\r\nThe following dates, brought out by the testimony, showed the receipt\r\nand suggested the disposition of the money:\r\n\r\nMay 21--Overhead trolley franchise granted by the Board of Supervisors.\r\n\r\nMay 22--$200,000 placed in the Mint to the credit of Patrick Calhoun.\r\n\r\nMay 25--General Ford drew $50,000 from the Mint which he exchanged for\r\ncurrency of small denominations.\r\n\r\nJuly 31--General Ford drew $50,000 from the Mint, which he exchanged for\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\nAugust 1--The Supervisors received from Gallagher their first payment\r\nfor voting to grant the overhead trolley permit. Gallagher testified\r\nthat he had received the money from Ruef. The payments were in currency,\r\nthe bills being of small denominations.\r\n\r\nAugust 23--General Ford drew $100,000 from the Mint, which he exchanged\r\nfor currency, receiving bills of large denominations.\r\n\r\nAugust 24-30--The Supervisors received their final payments from\r\nGallagher for their votes on the trolley permit. These last payments\r\nwere made in bills of large denominations. Gallagher testified that he\r\nhad received the money from Ruef.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawals from the Mint had been made by General Ford, on Mr.\r\nCalhoun's instructions to the Mint officials that the payments should be\r\nmade to the General.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of the Mint officials and employes was to the point and at\r\ntimes sensational. Nathan Selig, a clerk at the Mint, for example,\r\nassisted Eugene D. Hawkins as assistant cashier,[306] in making up a\r\npackage of $50,000 in bills which were turned over to Ford. Selig fixed\r\nthe time of the occurrence at \"shortly after the Mayor signed the\r\nfranchise bill for the overhead wire.\"\r\n\r\n\"What impressed that upon your mind?\" was asked him. \"Because I made the\r\nremark to Mr. Hawkins, as he was going out,\" replied Selig, \"that that\r\nwas--I thought it was, the Supervisors' 'bit'.\"\r\n\r\nHaving traced this $200,000 from Calhoun to the Mint and from the Mint\r\nto Ford, the prosecution proved by Charles Hagerty, Ruef's office boy,\r\nthat during the weeks after the fire General Ford and Mr. Mullally of\r\nthe United Railroads, had had conference with Ruef at Ruef's office.\r\nRuef was traced to Ford's office. Ford's stenographer testified,\r\nreluctantly, to Ruef's presence there. Ford was shown to have sent\r\nwarning, through his assistant Abbott, to Ruef, at the opening of the\r\ngraft investigation, that the Grand Jury was taking up the matter of the\r\nUnited Railroads trolley privilege, that the prosecution had not made\r\nany headway, that it was thought the next step would be to lay some trap\r\nfor the Supervisors.[307] That Ruef and Ford had more or less intimate\r\nrelations during this period was fully established.[308] The question\r\nraised was: Did the $85,000 in currency which Ruef gave Gallagher to be\r\npaid to the Supervisors for their votes on the overhead trolley permit\r\npass from Ford to Ruef? Did the money paid the Supervisors come out of\r\nthe unaccounted-for $200,000 which had disappeared into General Ford's\r\npossession?[309]\r\n\r\nA word from Abe Ruef would have lifted the case out of the plane of\r\ncircumstantial to that of positive evidence.\r\n\r\nA word from General Ford would have shown the manner in which the money\r\nhad been disposed.\r\n\r\nThose who took seriously Ruef's protestations at the time of his plea of\r\nguilty to extortion, that his life would thereafter be devoted to\r\nundoing the wrong he had wrought, looked to see the prosecution put Ruef\r\non the stand.\r\n\r\nThe many supporters of General Ford--he was one of the most likable and\r\npopular men in the State--who still held belief in his innocence, looked\r\nto see him take the stand to clear his name by accounting for the\r\ndisposition of that $200,000 which he had received, at the order of\r\nPresident Calhoun, from the Mint officials.\r\n\r\nBut neither Ruef nor Ford took the stand.\r\n\r\nLater developments in the graft cases showed why the prosecution did not\r\ncall upon Ruef to testify.\r\n\r\nBut no satisfactory showing has been made why General Ford did not take\r\nthe stand to tell, under oath, of the disposition of that $200,000 last\r\nseen in his possession.\r\n\r\nHeney, in an affidavit[310] acknowledged March 10, 1908, tells why Ruef\r\nwas not called upon to testify.\r\n\r\nSome ten days before the taking of testimony in the first Ford trial\r\nbegan, according to this affidavit, Heney had Gallagher and Ruef at his\r\noffice. The two men had told stories of the passage of the ordinance\r\ngranting the trolley permit, which conflicted slightly. Heney's purpose\r\nin confronting them, he tells us in the affidavit, was that he might\r\ndetermine in his own mind which was right. Heney had not seen Ruef,\r\nexcept as he had passed him in court or corridor, since he had proved\r\nthat Ruef had made misrepresentations to him in the French Restaurant\r\ncases.[311] The conversation between Ruef and Gallagher did not tend to\r\nchange Heney's opinion of the broken boss. Indeed, Heney became more\r\nfirmly convinced than ever that Ruef was not acting in good faith, that\r\nhe was not telling the whole truth. A few days after this meeting, Burns\r\nbrought Heney word that Ruef would not testify at the Ford trial at all,\r\nunless the prosecution allowed him to withdraw his plea of guilty in the\r\nextortion case, and dismissed all the indictments against him. Heney\r\nrefused to be coerced. He sent word back to Ruef that the prosecution\r\nhad had sufficient evidence to convict Ford before Ruef had told\r\nanything; that if Ruef were called to the witness-stand it would be\r\nwithout further talk with him; that none of the cases against him would\r\nbe dismissed, and that if called to the stand he could testify or not\r\ntestify, as he saw fit.\r\n\r\nThat night, according to Heney, Rabbis Nieto and Kaplan, with Ruef's\r\nattorney, Henry Ach,[312] appeared at Heney's office. Ach announced in\r\nsubstance, according to Heney's affidavit, that inasmuch as Heney and\r\nLangdon had promised to permit Ruef to withdraw his plea of guilty to\r\nthe extortion charge, and then dismiss the case, as a condition upon\r\nwhich Ruef signed the immunity contract,[313] the time had arrived when,\r\nin justice to Ruef, this ought to be done.[314]\r\n\r\nHeney let Ach finish.\r\n\r\n\"We might as well understand each other,\" Heney then announced. \"You\r\nknow perfectly well that I did not at any time make any such promise to\r\nRuef or to you, or to any one present, or to any one else on earth.\"\r\n\r\nHeney then recited the exact terms of his promise.[315] Both Kaplan and\r\nNieto agreed with him that his statement was correct, but Kaplan\r\ninsisted that he had understood that Ruef was to be allowed to withdraw\r\nhis plea, arguing that he had told the truth and that his evidence was\r\nvery important.\r\n\r\n\"Ruef lied to us,\" answered Heney emphatically, \"in the French\r\nRestaurant case, and I proved it to him in this very room, and he simply\r\nlaughed in my face. He also lied to us in all the other cases. He is not\r\nentitled to immunity in any case, and I not only will not permit him to\r\nwithdraw his plea of guilty in case number 305, but on the contrary it\r\nis my present intention to ask the court in that case to give him no\r\nleniency whatever, but to sentence him for the maximum term which is\r\nprescribed by law.\"\r\n\r\nHeney suggested that Ruef's representatives take this word back to their\r\nprincipal.\r\n\r\n\"Ruef,\" Heney concluded, \"tried to job the prosecution and he has only\r\nsucceeded in jobbing himself into the penitentiary.\"\r\n\r\nTen days later, when Heney made his opening statement before the first\r\nFord jury, he carefully refrained from stating that the prosecution\r\nexpected to prove any fact that necessarily depended in whole or in part\r\nupon Ruef's testimony. And with all San Francisco on tiptoe of\r\nexpectancy,[316] Heney closed the case of The People without putting\r\nRuef on the stand.[317]\r\n\r\nThe defense offered no evidence. The case went to the jury on the\r\nevidence which the prosecution had presented. The jury failed to agree,\r\neight standing for acquittal, and four for conviction.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ford was immediately brought to trial for the second time. The\r\ncase selected was for the bribery of Supervisor Jennings Phillips.\r\n\r\nHeney, in his opening statement, announced that he did not intend to put\r\nRuef on the stand. The second case presented was, if anything, stronger\r\nthan the first, but the jury brought in a verdict of \"not guilty.\"\r\nGeneral Ford was tried on a third of the indictments against him, and\r\nagain was the verdict of the jury \"not guilty.\"\r\n\r\nLong after, the prosecution discovered that agents for the United\r\nRailroads had systematically corrupted members of its detective force.\r\nOn the evidence in the hands of the prosecution, a search warrant was\r\nsecured, and the offices of the United Railroads raided in a search for\r\nstolen documents. Copies of over 2400 documents belonging to the\r\nprosecution were found. It developed that men in the employ of the\r\nprosecution were receiving regular monthly salaries from agents of the\r\nUnited Railroads to turn these reports over to agents of the defense for\r\ncopying. The defense was in this way kept informed of all that had been\r\nreported to the prosecution regarding jurors, etc., by Burns's own\r\nagents.[318]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the third Ford trial, for example, Heney was engaged with\r\nRuef's trial in the Parkside case. The Ford trial was conducted for the\r\nState by John O'Gara. One of Burns's men, Platt by name, was appointed\r\nto assist O'Gara by advising him of the character of the men drawn for\r\njury service. O'Gara repeatedly discovered Platt's advice and\r\nsuggestions to be unreliable. Long after it was discovered that Platt\r\nwas at the time in the employ of agents for the United Railroads. The\r\nreason for the character of his advice and suggestions was then\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nAt none of the Ford trials did the defense attempt to meet the evidence\r\nwhich the prosecution presented. At the third trial, the prosecution\r\ncalled President Calhoun and Abe Ruef[319] to the stand. But both\r\ndeclined to answer. The disposition of the $50,000 in currency in small\r\nbills, and of the $150,000 in currency in large bills, which passed into\r\nGeneral Ford's hands, at the time that currency of this exact amount and\r\ndescription passed into the hands of Abe Ruef, $85,000 of which Ruef\r\ndistributed among the Supervisors for voting for the United Railroads\r\ntrolley permit, continues as great a mystery as it was on the day that\r\nthe first Ford trial opened. Ruef at the time of his plea of guilty to\r\nthe extortion charge, and five years later in the story of his career\r\npublished in the San Francisco Bulletin, admitted that the $200,000 that\r\non Calhoun's order was turned over to Ford was soon after paid to him\r\n(Ruef) because of the granting of the trolley permit. The $85,000 that\r\nGallagher divided among the Supervisors on account of their granting\r\nthis permit, Ruef has stated in his several confessions, came out of\r\nthis Calhoun-to-Ford, Ford-to-Ruef $200,000.\r\n\r\nAnd in California there are many who hold that in this instance, at\r\nleast, Ruef is telling the truth.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [294] John Helms, a detective, testified at the trial of Patrick\r\n       Calhoun that he had been employed by the United Railroads as\r\n       early as May 3, 1907; that his duties consisted of \"mostly\r\n       shadow work, watching out for things being done by the\r\n       prosecution\"; that Patrick Calhoun had himself authorized him\r\n       (Helms) to employ men to follow Burns on motorcycles. Later on\r\n       automobiles were substituted for the motorcycles.\r\n\r\n       If Helms's employment began on May 3, as he testified, the\r\n       United Railroads was preparing for its defense at least three\r\n       weeks before indictments were brought against its officials.\r\n       The extent of that corporation's defense, or the details of\r\n       it, are not known to those outside the corporation. At the\r\n       Calhoun trial the Prosecution accounted for every dollar spent\r\n       in the operations against the Schmitz-Ruef regime. The\r\n       attorneys representing the United Railroads were invited to\r\n       make as frank statement of the expenditures made by the\r\n       defense, but they declined.\r\n\r\n [295] Ashe participated in the first Ford trials. At the time of the\r\n       later trials he was involved in the scandal of the alleged\r\n       kidnaping of Fremont Older.\r\n\r\n [296] In referring to the men and women employed by the graft\r\n       defense, The Call, in an editorial article, in its issue of\r\n       September 26, said:\r\n\r\n       \"The retinue of the trolley magnates, as exhibited in the Ford\r\n       case, makes a remarkable picture. Behind the expert lawyers of\r\n       last resort troops a motley train of gun fighters,\r\n       professional plug-uglies, decoys, disreputable 'detectives,'\r\n       thugs, women of the half world and the wolfish pack of gutter\r\n       journalism. It must be, indeed, a hard case that needs such\r\n       bolstering.\r\n\r\n       \"How will Mr. Calhoun square with his protestations of\r\n       high-mindedness the presence and the efforts in his behalf of\r\n       such creatures of the slums and stews as 'Bogie' O'Donnell and\r\n       'The Banjo Eyed Kid'? Are these and the others of their kidney\r\n       laboring in the same behalf as friends and sympathizers of Mr.\r\n       Calhoun or merely as his hired men?\"\r\n\r\n [297] At the Ford trial, Supervisor Lonergan had testified that he\r\n       had been followed during a recess of the court. The following\r\n       testimony followed:\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Was that Mr. Melrose, a detective of the Southern Pacific,\r\n       who is sitting there? A. I don't know Mr. Melrose.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Is he the gentleman sitting immediately back of Mr. Ford?\r\n       A. That is the gentleman; that is him.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. He was following you around during the noon hour? A. Yes,\r\n       sir.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Don't you know he is a detective of the Southern Pacific?\r\n       A. I don't know anything about the gentleman.\"\r\n\r\n [298] The Call, in its issue of September 26, 1907, stated in\r\n       explanation of how the graft defense had come by the statement\r\n       Lonergan had made to Dorland that: \"After court adjourned\r\n       (September 25) Attorney Rogers offered an explanation for\r\n       Walter Dorland, the man who was charged by the prosecution\r\n       with having attempted to kidnap Lonergan. Rogers's story\r\n       differed from that told by Dorland. Rogers stated that Dorland\r\n       was not a detective, but was in charge of a hospital in\r\n       Chicago. He came to San Francisco, where he met Luther Brown,\r\n       an associate of Rogers. Brown and Dorland were old friends and\r\n       the former induced Dorland to get statements from the\r\n       Supervisors for him. Dorland did this. Rogers says he has\r\n       statements from all the Supervisors with the exception of\r\n       Gallagher.\"\r\n\r\n [299] Heney states in an affidavit filed in the case of The People\r\n       vs. Patrick Calhoun et als., No. 823, that he had been\r\n       informed that the reason given by Ruef for securing the\r\n       signatures of the Supervisors to this affidavit was to find\r\n       out which, if any of them, had confessed, upon the theory that\r\n       any one of them who had confessed would refuse to sign an\r\n       affidavit, and upon the further theory that if such a\r\n       confessing member did sign the affidavit, he would thus be\r\n       making a contradictory statement under oath, which could thus\r\n       be further used against him by Ruef or Gallagher, upon the\r\n       trial of either of them.\r\n\r\n       But whatever Ruef's far-seeing motive, this affidavit which\r\n       he, through Keane, induced the Supervisors to sign, was used\r\n       by the attorneys for the defense at the graft trials to show\r\n       contradictory statements of the confessing Supervisors.\r\n\r\n [300] The San Francisco Call, in its issue of September 25, 1907, in\r\n       commenting on Lonergan's testimony, says: \"While Lonergan's\r\n       narrative tells a portion of the story, it is not all. In\r\n       another automobile were Detective Luther Brown and the\r\n       'Banjo-Eyed Kid' of the United Railroads. They followed close\r\n       on the heels of the auto occupied by Detective Dorland. Both\r\n       machines sped to a resort near the park, where a meeting place\r\n       had been arranged and where Lonergan was to be turned over to\r\n       the custody of the 'Banjo-Eyed Kid.' The rest was to be left\r\n       to the Kid. If the plan had carried there would have been no\r\n       Lonergan at the trial yesterday, the defense would have\r\n       flashed the statement secured by Dorland and set up the cry\r\n       that the entire prosecution of the United Railroads was a plot\r\n       set on foot by Rudolph Spreckels.\"\r\n\r\n [301] Several who participated in this affair were later indicted\r\n       for kidnaping. There were no convictions.\r\n\r\n [302] Burns in an affidavit filed in the case of The People vs.\r\n       Patrick Calhoun et als., 832, refers to a plot hatched about\r\n       the time of the Ford trials to kidnap Ruef. Burns charges that\r\n       Ruef was to have been taken into a mountain county and held\r\n       there until the United Railroads cases had been disposed of.\r\n       He states his belief that Ruef was party to the plot.\r\n\r\n [303] The disinclination of the United Railroads to produce its\r\n       books continues to cause that corporation inconvenience and\r\n       trouble. In 1913, for example, the corporation applied to the\r\n       California State Board of Railroad Commissioners for\r\n       permission to issue promissory notes to the amount of\r\n       $2,350,000. That the Commission might determine the necessity\r\n       of such an issue, request was made for the corporation's\r\n       books. This request was denied. The Commission withheld\r\n       authorization of the note issue. In commenting upon its\r\n       refusal, the Commission said:\r\n\r\n       \"It should be understood that the conclusions hereinbefore set\r\n       out have been reached on the partial information which has\r\n       been submitted to the Commission, and that if an examination\r\n       of the original books which the company has refused to supply\r\n       should reveal a different condition, the responsibility for\r\n       these conclusions, which we contend inevitably must be drawn\r\n       from what evidence is before us, lies with the applicant\r\n       because of its failure to submit its books for examination by\r\n       the Commission.\r\n\r\n       \"It is an axiom that evidence suppressed is deemed to be\r\n       adverse, and having in mind this axiom certainly the Commission\r\n       is justified in concluding that the books which the applicant\r\n       refuses to produce at least would not better its showing.\"\r\n\r\n       Following the defeat of the graft prosecution in November,\r\n       1909, peculiar transactions are recorded against the United\r\n       Railroads. For example, the Railroad Commission found, and has\r\n       so reported, that \"in the minutes (of the United Railroads) of\r\n       May 25, 1910, it appears that four years' 'back salary' was\r\n       voted to Patrick Calhoun, president of the United Railroads of\r\n       San Francisco, in the sum of $75,000 a year, or a total of\r\n       $300,000. No explanation is made of this item, but it at once\r\n       suggests the necessity of a thorough investigation in order to\r\n       determine the items claimed by applicant as operating expenses\r\n       of the United Railroads over a series of years.\" See Decision\r\n       No. 439 Railroad Commission of California, in the matter of the\r\n       application of the United Railroads, etc., February 4, 1913.\r\n\r\n [304] Both Wilson and Coffey were indicted for bribe-taking. Wilson\r\n       later on found his memory. At other graft trials he explained\r\n       that his testimony at the first Ford trial had been given\r\n       after he had undergone an operation that had involved the use\r\n       of large quantities of cocaine. He insisted that he did not\r\n       know to what he was testifying. Coffey was tried for\r\n       bribe-taking and convicted. The Supreme Court, however, set\r\n       aside the verdict on technicalities.\r\n\r\n [305] It was shown at the Ford trial that about $175,000 in addition\r\n       to the unaccounted-for $200,000 was received by the United\r\n       Railroads through the United States mint. Every dollar of this\r\n       $175,000 except $3,000 loaned to Ruef by Mullally, was taken\r\n       out by the treasurer of the company, and carried to the United\r\n       Railroads' office and there put in its safe and used as\r\n       needed, that it was taken in gold and was paid out to its\r\n       employees in gold. It was further shown that not one dollar of\r\n       currency was ever put in any of the safes at the United\r\n       Railroads' office by any person during that period of time\r\n       covered by Ford's withdrawal of money from the mint, and that\r\n       no currency was deposited to the credit of the company in any\r\n       of its bank accounts nor to the credit of Ford or Mullally or\r\n       Abbott, and that no currency was turned over to the treasurer\r\n       of the company during that time. Thus by a process of\r\n       exclusion this $200,000 was left in the hands of Ford\r\n       absolutely unaccounted for upon any theory consistent with an\r\n       honest use of it. Add these facts to the further facts that\r\n       Ruef was traced to Ford's office on two of the days on which\r\n       Ford got the money, and that Ruef on each occasion, within a\r\n       day or two, paid the same kind of money to Gallagher, that\r\n       currency was not generally in circulation at all in San\r\n       Francisco.\r\n\r\n [306] The two men were at the time detailed to handle the money of\r\n       the relief fund. The mint officials could not accommodate Ford\r\n       with the currency he wanted. They gave him gold. The gold\r\n       which Ford secured at the mint was trucked across the hall to\r\n       relief headquarters, where it was exchanged for the currency.\r\n       Selig and Hawkins counted out the bills.\r\n\r\n [307] See transcript of testimony, trial of The People vs. Tirey L.\r\n       Ford, No. 817, taken September 25, 1907, page 270.\r\n\r\n [308] Mr. Mullally, assistant to Mr. Calhoun, and also Mr. Calhoun\r\n       were known to have enjoyed friendly relations with Mr. Ruef\r\n       during this period.\r\n\r\n [309] The facts brought out at General Ford's trial are interesting\r\n       in connection with General Ford's interview in the San\r\n       Francisco Examiner of October 28, 1906, soon after the Graft\r\n       Prosecution opened. See Footnote 92.\r\n\r\n       Ruef, in \"The Road I Traveled,\" printed in the San Francisco\r\n       Bulletin, states that he gave Schmitz $50,000 and kept $50,000\r\n       for himself out of the $200,000 which was given to him by\r\n       Tirey L. Ford from Patrick Calhoun to pay for the granting of\r\n       the trolley permit.\r\n\r\n [310] This affidavit deals with the Graft Prosecution from its\r\n       beginning down to the spring of 1908. This document was filed\r\n       in the case of The People vs. Patrick Calhoun et als., No.\r\n       823.\r\n\r\n [311] See Chapter XVI, page 211, and footnote 119, page 111.\r\n\r\n [312] This is the same Ach who dramatically left the Ruef defense at\r\n       the time of Ruef's plea of guilty to extortion. See Chapter\r\n       XV, page 204.\r\n\r\n [313] For immunity contract see page xix of the Appendix. For the\r\n       negotiations upon which Ach's claim was based see Chapter XV.\r\n\r\n [314] Heney sets forth in his affidavit that Ach's claim did not\r\n       surprise him. He says of Ach's statement: \"I was not very much\r\n       surprised by its substance as I had long before commenced to\r\n       suspect that Ruef, Ach, Dr. Kaplan and Dr. Nieto would claim\r\n       eventually that such agreement existed in regard to case\r\n       number 305 (the extortion case) if it became necessary to do\r\n       so in order to keep Ruef out of the penitentiary. In fact I\r\n       would not have been greatly surprised by anything that Ach\r\n       might have claimed, as I have learned to know him pretty well\r\n       and am sometimes at a loss to decide whether he or Ruef is\r\n       entitled to first place as an artistic and imaginative\r\n       'equivocator,' to use Ruef's language.\"\r\n\r\n [315] See Chapter XV, pages 190-7. Heney states in his affidavit\r\n       that both Nieto and Kaplan agreed that Heney's statement of\r\n       the arrangement was correct. \"Yes, you are right, Mr. Heney,\"\r\n       the affidavit sets forth Nieto said. \"I understand it that\r\n       way, and consequently I never told Ruef anything about that.\r\n       He never got that from me.\" The affidavit sets forth that\r\n       Kaplan said in substance: \"Yes, that is what you said, Mr.\r\n       Heney, but I always understood that Mr. Ruef would be allowed\r\n       to withdraw his plea of guilty in the French Restaurant cases\r\n       and would not receive any punishment.\"\r\n\r\n       Heney replied in substance: \"You may have so understood,\r\n       Doctor, but you had no right so to understand from anything\r\n       which I said.\"\r\n\r\n [316] Heney, in his closing argument, told the jury that Ruef had\r\n       not been put on the stand because the prosecution did not\r\n       trust him. Heney said: \"Nobody except Mr. Ford and Mr. Ruef\r\n       could tell about it (the passing of the $200,000). They did\r\n       not complain about my asking why they did not put Mr. Ruef on\r\n       the stand. They asked why we didn't put him on the stand and\r\n       vouch for his veracity and enable them to put words in his\r\n       mouth, and I will answer now, because we DID NOT TRUST HIM.\"\r\n\r\n [317] Heney, in his affidavit, describes the disappointment of Ruef,\r\n       Ach and Nieto when the case was closed without Ruef being\r\n       called. Heney says: \"I rested the case on behalf of the\r\n       prosecution in the first Ford trial in this department of this\r\n       Court on the 2nd day of October, 1907, and the attorneys for\r\n       the defendant asked for time to consider what they would do\r\n       about putting in evidence, and Court adjourned for the purpose\r\n       of giving them such time. I had noticed Henry Ach and Ruef\r\n       sitting together next to the aisle, which was directly in\r\n       front of where I sat, and could see that up to the time I\r\n       closed the case they were anxiously waiting for me to call\r\n       Ruef as a witness. When Court adjourned they remained sitting\r\n       and as I passed them Ach stopped me and said in substance,\r\n       'Why didn't you put Ruef on the stand as a witness? Are you\r\n       not going to dismiss these cases against him?' I replied in\r\n       substance, 'There are a lot more cases to be tried. There will\r\n       be plenty of opportunities to dismiss these cases if I want to\r\n       do it.' Ruef said, with one of his most winning smiles, in\r\n       substance, 'I guess he is going to put me on in rebuttal just\r\n       as he did in the Schmitz case.' I replied in substance, 'Oh, I\r\n       don't know about that, Ruef. I don't like to try all my cases\r\n       the same way.' I started to leave and Ach stopped me as I had\r\n       taken only a couple of steps, and said in substance, 'There\r\n       isn't any change in the situation, is there in regard to\r\n       Ruef?' I smilingly and meaningly replied, in substance, 'Not a\r\n       particle, Henry, since our last talk,' meaning thereby the\r\n       talk which Ach and myself had on or about the 19th or 20th day\r\n       of September, 1907, at night in my office in the presence of\r\n       Dr. Nieto, Dr. Kaplan, William J. Burns and Charles W. Cobb,\r\n       as hereinbefore set forth. As I made this statement I walked\r\n       on out of the courtroom and someone stopped me somewhere\r\n       between there and the entrance door of the building and Dr.\r\n       Nieto came up to me, all smiles, and said in substance, 'You\r\n       didn't put Ruef on the stand, did you?' I replied, 'No, I did\r\n       not, Doctor.' Dr. Nieto then said in substance, 'There isn't\r\n       any change in the situation, is there?' And I replied with a\r\n       smile in substance, 'None whatever since our last talk,\r\n       Doctor,' meaning the talk at my office just hereinbefore\r\n       referred to, at which Dr. Nieto, Dr. Kaplan and Ach were\r\n       present. The manner of Ach and the manner of Dr. Nieto when I\r\n       made this reply to each of them indicated plainly that each\r\n       understood exactly what I meant.\"\r\n\r\n [318] Calhoun protested vigorously against the raiding of his\r\n       offices. Concerning the raid and Mr. Calhoun's protests, the\r\n       interior press expressed general approval of the first and\r\n       condemnation of the latter.\r\n\r\n       \"It is not a question,\" said the Oroville Register, \"alone of\r\n       graft in San Francisco now. It is rather a question as to\r\n       whether in America, where 'all men are free and equal,' there\r\n       is a law for the rich and another law for the poor, and\r\n       whether a little money can put our whole penal system at\r\n       naught and make monkeys of judicial officers. Unluckily in the\r\n       Calhoun case we can not in America resort to the czar-like\r\n       methods which should be resorted to, but must fight it out by\r\n       the long and slow process of law. Luckily for the honor of\r\n       America Mr. Heney and his associates are gifted with the\r\n       courage, ability and tenacity to fight it out on this line\r\n       even if it takes this summer and the whole of the next so to\r\n       do.\"\r\n\r\n       \"The 'private sanctity' of Calhoun's offices,\" said the Santa\r\n       Barbara Independent, \"was violated, his defenders say, when the\r\n       police entered to search for stolen goods. The fact that the\r\n       goods were concealed in the offices--that the police unearthed\r\n       there a 'fence' for the reception of stolen goods--doesn't seem\r\n       to have destroyed the sanctity of the place.\r\n\r\n       \"Recently the police in Los Angeles raided a cigar store, where\r\n       they found concealed some of the money that three months ago\r\n       had been stolen from the Monrovia bank. The cigar dealer's\r\n       lawyers should go into court and protest against violation of\r\n       the 'private sanctity' of the thief's hiding place.\r\n\r\n       \"It is beyond understanding how men can view a similar\r\n       circumstance in different lights. To an unprejudiced mind a\r\n       thief is a thief, whether he has stolen an old pair of shoes or\r\n       robbed the public through a municipal or other government. And\r\n       the honest man rejoices in his capture, the recovery of the\r\n       stolen goods and apprehension and punishment of persons who\r\n       receive and conceal the fruits of theft.\"\r\n\r\n [319] Calhoun and Ruef were placed on the stand April 29, 1908.\r\n       Their refusal to answer will be found in the transcript of\r\n       testimony taken that day. Complete records of all the graft\r\n       cases were in 1912, when this review was written, in the\r\n       possession of A. A. Moore, prominently connected with the\r\n       graft defense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n                   THE SAN FRANCISCO ELECTION OF 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\nScarcely had the prosecution overcome the delaying tactics of the\r\ndefense, and forced graft cases to trial, than District Attorney Langdon\r\nhad to defend title to his office at the polls.\r\n\r\nLangdon had taken office in January, 1906. His term was to expire in\r\nJanuary, 1908. The municipal election, at which Mr. Langdon's successor\r\nwas to be elected, was to be held in November.\r\n\r\nAt that time was to be elected besides the District Attorney, the Mayor,\r\nSupervisors and practically all the other municipal officials.\r\n\r\nThe old convention system of naming candidates for office still\r\nprevailed in San Francisco. However, California had even then entered\r\nupon the struggle of throwing off the yoke of machine domination through\r\nthe convention system of naming candidates. The delegates to the several\r\nconventions had, under primary law provisions, to be elected at the\r\npolls.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco was divided upon one issue--that of the Graft Prosecution.\r\nThe opposition which years of adverse publicity was to develop, did not\r\nthen confront those who were standing for vigorous prosecution of the\r\ncorrupters of the municipality. But under the hammering of an adverse\r\npress, and the claquer's systematic belittling, the graft defense had\r\nmade gains sufficient to give it at least a fighting chance at the\r\npolls.\r\n\r\nOn the side of the defense, too, was the solid support of the powerful\r\nSouthern Pacific Company, and of the various public service\r\ncorporations, as well as the purchasable press. On the side of the\r\nprosecution stood the people of San Francisco, not yet worn out, nor\r\nmisled, nor yet alienated from the policy of vigorous prosecution of the\r\ncorrupters of the municipality. The people recognized that effective\r\ncontinuance of the prosecution required that Mr. Langdon be re-elected.\r\n\r\nThat the action of the prosecution in making Taylor Mayor, might be\r\nendorsed at the polls--thus receiving the stamp of public approval--Mr.\r\nTaylor's election became quite as important as that of Mr. Langdon. The\r\nsame was true of those of the Taylor-appointed Supervisors who became\r\ncandidates for election. But the contest waged about the election of\r\nTaylor and Langdon.\r\n\r\nSuch was the issue which confronted San Francisco at the 1907 election.\r\n\r\nThere was but one issue. There were, however, three prominent political\r\nparties, Union Labor, Republican and Democratic. None of the three could\r\nbe called the prosecution party, nor for that matter, the defense party;\r\nnor had any faction of any of the parties the temerity to declare\r\nagainst the prosecution of those trapped in corruption, however\r\nvigorously opposed to the prosecution this or that faction might be. But\r\neach of the three parties did divide on the question of the election of\r\nLangdon and Taylor.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, the supporters of the prosecution in all parties\r\ndemanded that Taylor and Langdon be nominated. The opponents of the\r\nprosecution, while declaring loudly for the prosecution of all\r\noffenders against the law, labored for their defeat. On this issue, not\r\nalways clearly defined, the intraparty factions met at the primary\r\npolls. The prosecution, therefore, had three independent political\r\nfights on its hands.\r\n\r\nLangdon had been elected by the Union Labor party. Taylor was a\r\nDemocrat. But in the confusion of the times the principal primary fight\r\nwas within the Republican party.\r\n\r\nThe Republican opposition to those roughly described as\r\n\"pro-prosecution,\" found expression in the remnants of the old-time\r\nmachine--generally called Herrin--element. At its head were many of the\r\nexperienced machine leaders. The Republican pro-prosecution forces were\r\nat first without definite leadership. But in this emergency most\r\neffective leadership developed.\r\n\r\nDaniel A. Ryan, a young \"Irish-American,\" came to the fore as captain of\r\nthe reform forces within the Republican party.\r\n\r\nRyan is of the highest type of his race, as developed under the\r\nadvantageous conditions to which the immigrant and his descendants have,\r\nin these United States, been admitted. Well educated, forceful, a\r\nbrilliant speaker, effective as an organizer, a lover of the political\r\ngame, Ryan was soon the recognized leader of the new movement.\r\n\r\nHe was trusted implicitly. The selection of candidates for convention\r\nplaces was left largely in his hands. Under Mr. Ryan's leadership the\r\nfight for effective continuation of the Graft Prosecution was carried on\r\nwithin the Republican party.\r\n\r\nThe division in the Union Labor party was scarcely less pronounced. The\r\nparty, roughly speaking, divided with P. H. McCarthy heading the\r\nanti-prosecution side, and men of the type of Walter Macarthur, one of\r\nthe founders of the party, leading the forces supporting Langdon and his\r\nassociates.\r\n\r\nBut here again there was most confusing division. Thomas F. Eagan,\r\nchairman of the Union Labor Party County Committee, for example, was\r\nquoted within a week of the primaries, as announcing: \"Schmitz is an\r\nideal candidate (for Mayor). If available, he would be nominated by the\r\ndelegates that will be elected on the regular Union Labor ticket.\"\r\nNevertheless, Mr. Eagan was unalterably opposed to Mr. McCarthy heading\r\nthe ticket.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic division was less pronounced than in either the\r\nRepublican or Union Labor party. The side favoring Taylor, without much\r\nreference to Langdon, went to the primary polls under the regular\r\nDemocratic leadership, with Thomas W. Hickey, chairman of the Democratic\r\nCounty Central Committee, at its head. Prominent in the opposition was\r\nLewis F. Byington, who had preceded Mr. Langdon as District Attorney.\r\nMr. Byington was brother-in-law of General Tirey L. Ford, even then\r\nunder trial for bribery, and one of General Ford's attorneys.\r\n\r\nIn the confusion of these many-sided contests, the defense had its best\r\nopportunity for success. But the result, so far as the Democratic and\r\nRepublican parties were concerned, was overwhelmingly successful for the\r\nprosecution.[320]\r\n\r\nOf the delegates to the Republican convention the Ryan (pro-prosecution)\r\nforces elected 142, the \"Herrin\" (anti-prosecution) forces 7 only. Of\r\nthe 164 delegates to the Democratic convention, 161 were elected by the\r\nregular (pro-prosecution) element, and 3 by the Byington\r\n(anti-prosecution) side. The popular vote within these parties was\r\nscarcely less pronounced.[321] On the other hand, within the Union Labor\r\nparty the anti-prosecution forces were overwhelmingly successful, the\r\nMcCarthy faction electing 185 delegates and the forces led by Walter\r\nMacarthur and his associates 13 only.\r\n\r\nUnder the alignment, it was expected that the Republicans and Democrats\r\nwould unite without hesitation upon Taylor and Langdon, leaving the\r\ncause of the indicted corporation managers to find expression in the\r\nUnion Labor party platform and candidates.[322]\r\n\r\nBut scarcely had the primary returns been made public than the San\r\nFrancisco Call, generally regarded as staunchly on the side of the\r\nprosecution, brought confusion upon the pro-prosecution element, by\r\nsuggesting the candidacy of Mr. Ryan for Mayor and belittling the\r\ncandidacy of Mayor Taylor.\r\n\r\n\"Ryan,\" said The Call through its political representative, Mr. George\r\nVan Smith, \"has not sought and is not seeking the Republican nomination\r\nfor Mayor. He may have it forced upon him and find himself the recipient\r\nof similar endorsement of his powers as a boss-buster, from the\r\nDemocratic organization.\"\r\n\r\nThe Call, in the same issue, hinted that the Democrats might not\r\nnominate Taylor. Without a Democratic nomination, Taylor could not\r\nexpect nomination at the hands of the Republicans.\r\n\r\n\"That the Democrats will nominate Mayor Taylor,\" said The Call, \"is more\r\nthan doubtful. Mayor Taylor was drafted into the city's service. He has\r\nnot given any indication of a desire to serve the city as the head of\r\nits government after the time when a popularly selected successor could\r\nbe qualified. If the Democrats do not nominate Dr. Taylor, the\r\nRepublicans would scarcely be expected to do so. The fact that the men\r\nwho will make up an almost exclusive majority of the Republican\r\nconvention seem to be committed to the idea of nominating Ryan appears\r\nto preclude the nomination of Taylor by either party.\"\r\n\r\nThe source of The Call's information is not apparent. Up to the time of\r\nthe publication of its article, August 15, there was no sentiment in San\r\nFrancisco for the election of Mr. Ryan to the Mayoralty. On the\r\ncontrary, the understanding was that Mr. Ryan had entered the contest\r\nfrom motives of good citizenship only, and that he was in no sense a\r\nseeker of office for himself.[323] Such had been the understanding\r\nduring the primary campaign; such was the sense of the community after\r\nthe primary vote had been cast.\r\n\r\nAll recognized, however, that Mr. Ryan was in a position of great power.\r\nHe had been trusted implicitly. The selection of anti-Herrin candidates\r\nfor delegates had been left largely in his hands. Few thought, however,\r\nthat he had selected delegates for the purpose of giving himself the\r\nRepublican nomination for the Mayoralty. Then, again, aside from the\r\nconfusion his candidacy would work in the ranks of the anti-Herrin,\r\npro-prosecution element, Mr. Ryan, while a pleasing young man and\r\nclever politician, it was generally recognized had few qualities usually\r\nlooked for in the Mayor of a community of half a million people.\r\n\r\nTo add to the confusion, The Examiner, which was now in active\r\nopposition to the prosecution, came out strongly against Mr. Ryan's\r\ncandidacy, denouncing it as \"a grotesque piece of effrontery.\" \"For the\r\nprimary leader,\" said The Examiner, \"to appropriate the office to\r\nhimself, is like the agent of a charity fund determining that he is the\r\nmost worthy object of the charity, and putting[324] the money in his own\r\npocket.\"\r\n\r\nBut Ryan's candidacy was not to be defeated by adverse criticism. Mr.\r\nRyan had been largely instrumental in selecting the Republican delegates\r\nwho were to name the candidates. Besides, he had the clever support, in\r\nits local columns at least, of the San Francisco Call. He had about him\r\na number of enthusiastic young men who were ambitiously active in urging\r\nhis candidacy.\r\n\r\n\"Every time the Taylor boomers gain a man they lose one,\" announced\r\nPerry Newberry, Secretary of Mr. Ryan's organization, and Ryan's\r\nright-hand man. \"As far as the Republicans are concerned Daniel A. Ryan\r\nis as good as named. It will be Ryan, not Taylor, who will sweep the\r\ncity.\"\r\n\r\nWith the advocacy of Ryan's candidacy, came quiet, systematic opposition\r\nto the nomination of Langdon.\r\n\r\nWith Mr. Ryan and his associates in control of the convention that was\r\nto nominate, it began to look as though the victory which the\r\npro-prosecution Republicans, under Mr. Ryan's leadership, had won at the\r\nprimaries, was barren indeed.\r\n\r\nAmong the Democrats, the opposition to Langdon and Taylor was even more\r\ndiscouraging. Langdon had been candidate for Governor two years before\r\non the Independence League ticket. Theodore A. Bell had had the\r\nDemocratic and Union Labor nominations. Bell had been defeated by a\r\nplurality. Bell ascribed his defeat to Langdon. The so-called Bell\r\nDemocrats accordingly made this an excuse for objecting to Langdon.[325]\r\nAs to Taylor, with the ability of the forces at work to defeat the\r\nprosecution considered, opinion gained daily that the failure of the\r\nRepublican convention to nominate Taylor, would be followed by a refusal\r\nof the Democrats to give him nomination.\r\n\r\nThus with the supporters of the prosecution overwhelmingly successful at\r\nthe Republican and Democratic primaries, there was grave danger that\r\ntheir purposes would be set aside by political manipulation.\r\n\r\nBut at this crisis a new element was injected into the situation.\r\n\r\nCitizens who stood for enforcement of the law hastily formed a\r\nnon-partisan organization to uphold the hands of the prosecution.[326]\r\nThey called their organization the Good Government League. Taking for\r\ntheir motto \"CITIZENSHIP ABOVE PARTISANSHIP,\" they boldly announced\r\ntheir support of Langdon for District Attorney, and of Taylor for Mayor.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of San Francisco toward the Graft Prosecution was shown by\r\nthe reception given the new organization. Citizens by the thousands sent\r\nin their application for membership. Funds for the purposes of the\r\ncampaign were forwarded by men in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic leaders were the first to appreciate the significance of\r\nthe reception given the new movement. What was practically a combination\r\nbetween the two forces resulted. This insured the nomination of Langdon\r\nand Taylor by the Democrats. It also assured the nomination of Langdon\r\nby the Republicans, for after the stand taken by the Good Government\r\nLeague, for either Republican or Democratic party to have rejected\r\nLangdon would have been an exhibition of \"poor politics.\" But Ryan still\r\ncontrolled the Republican convention. The Republican convention\r\nnominated Mr. Ryan for Mayor.\r\n\r\nMr. Ryan's nomination was not accomplished without protest. The citizens\r\nwho attended the convention as spectators were overwhelmingly for\r\nTaylor. Taylor received 53 out of the 148 convention votes, 95 being\r\ncast for Mr. Ryan. The minority charged that in the nomination of Mr.\r\nRyan, the Republicans of San Francisco had been betrayed, and that they\r\nwould not be bound by the nomination nor support the nominee.[327]\r\n\r\nThe Union Labor party, following out its policy of opposition to the\r\nprosecution, nominated P. H. McCarthy[328] for Mayor, and Frank McGowan\r\nfor District Attorney.\r\n\r\nThe planks of the several parties dealing with the prosecution were\r\ncharacteristic of the conventions from which they issued.\r\n\r\nThe Union Labor plank definitely pledged its candidate for District\r\nAttorney to prosecution of the Supervisors who had confessed to\r\nbribe-taking although it had been clearly pointed out that such\r\nprosecution would bar effective prosecution of those responsible for the\r\nbribe-giving.[329]\r\n\r\nThe Republican plank left the reader in doubt as to whether or not the\r\ndelinquent Supervisors were to be prosecuted. The Democratic plank alone\r\npledged unqualified support to the prosecution \"in any effort it may\r\nmake to convict any guilty person.\"[330]\r\n\r\nThe new alignment which followed the clearing of the atmosphere by the\r\nnomination of candidates, and the adoption of platforms, involved some\r\nastonishing changes.\r\n\r\nThe Examiner, which, on September 19, preceding the nominations, had\r\ndescribed Mr. Ryan's candidacy as \"a grotesque piece of effrontery,\" and\r\ncompared him to the custodian of a trust fund who puts the money in his\r\nown pocket, announced its support of Mr. Ryan for Mayor. On October 20,\r\na month and a day after publication of the custodian-of-a-trust-fund\r\neditorial article, The Examiner \"unhesitatingly recommended to all the\r\nvoters of San Francisco,\" Mr. Ryan, \"as the man best qualified to be the\r\nnext Mayor of the city.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, The Call, which was the first to suggest Mr. Ryan's\r\ncandidacy, describing him a heroic young \"boss buster,\" to whom the\r\nDemocrats could logically turn for a mayoralty candidate, after his\r\nnomination, described him as \"a cheap politician itching for\r\noffice,\"[331] whose candidacy was the one element which threw a doubt\r\nupon the election of Mayor Taylor. Following the conventions, The Call\r\nsupported Taylor as against the field.\r\n\r\nThe Chronicle tactfully refrained from taking sides until after the\r\nnominations were announced.[332] Then The Chronicle gave support to\r\nTaylor. If the shifting policy of the newspapers had raised a doubt as\r\nto where the people of San Francisco stood on the issue, that doubt was\r\ndispelled by the opening meeting of the Taylor-Langdon campaign. The\r\nlargest auditorium in San Francisco was packed to the doors,[333] with\r\ncitizens whose one purpose, expressed by approving cheers every time\r\nthe subject was mentioned, was support of the prosecution which had\r\nbroken up the Schmitz-Ruef organization, and which bade fair to bring to\r\nbook the corrupters of the municipal government.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was thoroughly representative. Labor touched elbows with\r\ncapital. Among the speakers were representative Labor Union leaders, who\r\nhad definitely broken with the Union Labor party.\r\n\r\n\"It is inconceivable to me,\" said Walter Macarthur, one of the\r\norganizers of the Union Labor party, in a ringing address, \"that any\r\nhonest thinking labor man would stand for the proposition that those men\r\nwho have debauched the officials of our city should go scot free while\r\nthe victims of their cupidity be sent behind the prison bars alone. I\r\nbelieve that labor will join with all honest people in declaring that if\r\nthe corrupt bribe-taker is punished the man who is at the head of this\r\ncorruption must be punished also. That is the issue of this campaign and\r\nI believe that election day will prove the virtue of my faith.\"\r\n\r\nThat the contest for the District Attorney's office overshadowed in\r\nimportance the mayoralty fight was fully recognized. The Union Labor\r\nparty, which had nominated and elected Langdon in 1905, had repudiated\r\nhim, and named Frank McGowan as Langdon's only serious opponent. The\r\nRepublicans and Democrats, who had under a fusion arrangement in 1905\r\nopposed Langdon's election; united, in 1907, to fight for his\r\ncontinuance in office. The public service corporations, especially those\r\nwhose officials were under indictment, generally opposed Mr. Langdon's\r\nelection, and supported the candidacy of his Union Labor party\r\nopponent.\r\n\r\nThis was particularly astonishing in the case of the United Railroads,\r\nwhose president, Mr. Patrick Calhoun, was even then posing as a \"labor\r\nunion buster,\" while the United Railroads was very effectively grinding\r\nto pieces the San Francisco Carmen's Union.[334]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there was certain consistency in the political course\r\ntaken by the United Railroads. Whatever the differences President\r\nCalhoun, in his role as a \"union buster,\" may have had with the labor\r\nunion, there was much in common between him and the San Francisco Union\r\nLabor party as headed by Mr. McCarthy.[335] President Calhoun and his\r\ncompany opposed the prosecution vigorously. Mr. McCarthy and his party\r\nwent quite as far in this opposition. President Calhoun was most\r\nemphatic in his denunciation of those who had made the graft prosecution\r\npossible. Mr. McCarthy was scarcely less emphatic in his denunciation.\r\nIndeed, Mr. McCarthy opened his campaign with an attack upon the graft\r\nprosecution. Inasmuch as the one issue before the people was the\r\ncontinuance of the graft prosecution along the lines that had proved so\r\ndistasteful to Mr. Calhoun and those in the same predicament as himself,\r\nthe support of the Union Labor party candidate for District Attorney by\r\na union-labor-busting corporation was not entirely inconsistent.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, Mr. McGowan, the Union Labor party candidate, definitely\r\npledged himself to continue the prosecution, but he promised that the\r\nprosecution which he would carry on should not \"disturb business,\" that\r\nHeney[336] should no longer be retained as special prosecutor, that the\r\nSupervisors who had confessed to bribe-giving should be prosecuted[337]\r\nas well as those who had given bribes.\r\n\r\nThis last was one of the chief arguments advanced in support of Mr.\r\nMcGowan's candidacy. On the ground that a mistake had been made, if a\r\nwrong had not been done, when the Supervisors were granted\r\nimmunity,[338] it was urged that Mr. Langdon should not be continued in\r\nthe District Attorney's office.\r\n\r\nThe election returns[339] were conclusive of San Francisco's attitude on\r\nthe several issues raised. Taylor was elected Mayor, with a clear\r\nmajority of 415 over all his competitors. Langdon's majority over all\r\ncompetitors, including the Socialist candidate, was 13,510, his\r\nplurality over McGowan being 14,808. And with the election of Taylor\r\nand Langdon[340] were elected all the Good Government League candidates\r\nfor Supervisors.\r\n\r\nThe Graft Prosecution had successfully passed another crisis. It had,\r\ntoo, received overwhelming endorsement of The People at the polls.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [320] The outcome of the Republican primaries was looked upon as a\r\n       victory for good government. Said the Call, in discussing the\r\n       returns: \"Two things stand out prominently in the returns of\r\n       the primary elections yesterday. One is that the Republicans\r\n       of San Francisco have had enough of Herrin. The other is that\r\n       they have not had enough of the graft prosecution. The victory\r\n       for decency and for the independence of the party from the\r\n       thralldom in which Herrin has so long held it for the use and\r\n       benefit of the Southern Pacific was complete, with a vote\r\n       large enough to make it plain to Herrin and to the interests\r\n       exposed and to be exposed in the debauchery of public servants\r\n       that they must look elsewhere than to the Republicans of San\r\n       Francisco for the old corrupt conditions. The Call takes to\r\n       itself credit for some share in the accomplishment of this\r\n       good work. It was this paper that spoiled Herrin's infamous\r\n       apportionment scheme by which he planned to fill the burned\r\n       district with his dummies and thus control the municipal\r\n       convention. It was this paper that began and carried on to the\r\n       last moment a vigorous campaign in behalf of the decent\r\n       element of the Republican party, whose leadership was in the\r\n       capable and clean hands of Daniel A. Ryan. The Call has no\r\n       candidates. It wants only honest, capable independent men. It\r\n       made this winning fight because it wanted a clean government\r\n       for San Francisco and because it wanted the graft prosecution\r\n       carried out to the end.\"\r\n\r\n [321] The primary vote was the largest up to that time cast in San\r\n       Francisco. It was as follows:\r\n\r\n          Anti-Herrin (Ryan) Republican       8,116\r\n          Herrin Republicans                  3,207\r\n          Irregular Republicans               1,549\r\n          Regular Democratic                  2,438\r\n          Byington, Democratic                1,081\r\n          McCarthy, Union Labor               3,655\r\n          Macarthur, Union Labor              2,197\r\n\r\n [322] On the eve of the primary election, P. H. McCarthy, leader of\r\n       the anti-Prosecution faction of the Union Labor party, issued\r\n       a warning to union men In which he said: \"Too much caution\r\n       cannot be exercised by you, nor too much diligence displayed\r\n       in order to protect your rights at the polls today. One of the\r\n       most cunning, deceptive and vicious attacks ever made on\r\n       organized labor in this city is now being launched in order\r\n       that your wages may be cut and your working hours increased to\r\n       suit the millionaires in this city. To do so, those\r\n       millionaires have drawn to their side by what force we are\r\n       unable to say, certain labor men (Walter Macarthur and his\r\n       associates) with a view to shuffling, confusing and thoroughly\r\n       misleading the labor union voters and their sympathizers in\r\n       this city.\"\r\n\r\n [323] Many Ryan Republican district tickets contained the following\r\n       printed statement:\r\n\r\n       \"The candidates on this ticket are pledged to use all their\r\n       influence in the convention to secure the nomination of a\r\n       ticket of capable men and hope that they will be indorsed by\r\n       the conventions of all parties. They do not care who these men\r\n       may be, but will vote for no man who can be suspected of\r\n       peddling offices or jobs in return for support. They do not\r\n       desire nor expect for themselves or for their friends any\r\n       offices or jobs. No candidate on this ticket has ever sought\r\n       or held a political office or job. The candidates on this\r\n       ticket have all accepted the pledge of the Regular Republican\r\n       League. Daniel A. Ryan, chairman; Perry H. Newberry,\r\n       secretary.\"\r\n\r\n [324] The Examiner, in its issue of September 19, 1907, in\r\n       discussing Mr. Ryan's proposed candidacy said: \"It is\r\n       generally understood that Mr. Dan Ryan proposes to nominate\r\n       himself as the Republican candidate for Mayor of San\r\n       Francisco. That he has the power to do this thing is one of\r\n       the curiosities of our political system.\r\n\r\n       \"The theory is that the delegates to a convention represent\r\n       that part of the public which marches under the political\r\n       banner of a political party. But Mr. Ryan evidently considers\r\n       that the delegates to the Republican convention were chosen to\r\n       advance his personal political ambitions.\r\n\r\n       \"The people do not mean that the accidental leaders of a\r\n       primary fight should put the offices in their own pockets.\r\n\r\n       \"They elect delegates as agents to select candidates from among\r\n       the people. The delegates are the bearers of a trust and\r\n       neither they nor the man who happens to captain them in the\r\n       scramble between factions has a right to appropriate the\r\n       nominations.\r\n\r\n       \"The trust is not fulfilled if the primary leader assumes that\r\n       because the people elected his primary ticket they want him in\r\n       office. They don't want him, for they don't want primary\r\n       politicians in the Mayor's chair.\r\n\r\n       \"The theory of any convention is that it is assembled to choose\r\n       the best man in the party for its candidate. The spectacle of\r\n       Mr. Dan Ryan holding a caucus with himself, and deciding that\r\n       he is better qualified to be Mayor of San Francisco than any\r\n       other man in the Republican party, is a grotesque piece of\r\n       effrontery.\r\n\r\n       \"All sorts of men rise to the top in primary fights, but most\r\n       of them have a sufficient sense of modesty, if not of the\r\n       fitness of things, to abstain from making themselves the\r\n       recipients of what the delegates have to give.\r\n\r\n       \"For the primary leader to appropriate the office to himself Is\r\n       like the agent of a charity fund determining that he is the\r\n       most worthy object of the charity and putting the money in his\r\n       own pocket.\"\r\n\r\n [325] It was anything to defeat Langdon, even though a\r\n       pro-prosecution attorney be employed against him. Hiram W.\r\n       Johnson, for example, was suggested as his opponent. But\r\n       Johnson let it be understood, and with characteristic\r\n       positiveness, that under no considerations would he be a\r\n       candidate against Langdon.\r\n\r\n [326] The members of the Good Government League Executive Committee\r\n       were: E. L. Baldwin, J. E. Cutten, George Renner, Gen. Samuel\r\n       W. Backus, George R. Fletcher, Sigmund Bauer, B. H. Gurnette,\r\n       Frank W. Marvin, Frank W. Gale, L. C. McAfee, George Uhl, Rev.\r\n       Chas. N. Lathrop, Isidor Jacobs, Rudolph Spreckels, Edgar A.\r\n       Mathews.\r\n\r\n [327] The minority which voted for Taylor, in a memorial to the\r\n       convention, charged \"that the majority of the delegates to\r\n       this convention have betrayed the confidence reposed in them\r\n       by their constituents\" and gave notice that it would not be\r\n       bound by the nomination of the convention for Mayor and would\r\n       not support the nominee, but would do all in its power to\r\n       further the election of Dr. Edward R. Taylor.\r\n\r\n [328] The Union Labor party convention also had its sensations.\r\n       Thomas F. Eagan, for example, and his followers bolted the\r\n       convention because of McCarthy's nomination. The Carmen's\r\n       Union refused to accept the Union Labor party ticket because\r\n       Langdon had not been nominated for District Attorney.\r\n\r\n [329] Heney, on the eve of election, in reply to McGowan's argument\r\n       that the bribe-takers should be prosecuted, effectively\r\n       answered this contention. Heney's communication read: \"To\r\n       Frank McGowan, Esq. Sir: You are reported by the newspapers as\r\n       having stated that you will prosecute the boodling Supervisors\r\n       and that you will also prosecute Patrick Calhoun and the other\r\n       rich bribers, and that you will grant immunity to no one. I\r\n       invite you to answer specifically the following questions\r\n       either in the newspapers or the next time you make a public\r\n       speech:\r\n\r\n       \"1. If you prosecute Supervisor Lonergan (or any other\r\n       Supervisor) for accepting a bribe to influence his vote in the\r\n       matter of the trolley franchise, what witness, or witnesses,\r\n       will you call to prove that he accepted the bribe?\r\n\r\n       \"2. Every child in town now knows that if Lonergan received the\r\n       money at all it was from Supervisor Gallagher. Will you prove\r\n       the fact by Gallagher? If you call Gallagher as a witness, how\r\n       do you expect to induce him to testify without granting him\r\n       Immunity?\r\n\r\n       \"3. When you prosecute James L. Gallagher for giving a bribe to\r\n       Tom Lonergan or to any other Supervisor to influence his vote\r\n       on the trolley franchise matter, by what witness or witnesses,\r\n       will you prove that Gallagher paid the money to Lonergan or to\r\n       any other Supervisor? Will you call Lonergan or any other\r\n       Supervisor as a witness, and when you call him, how will you\r\n       induce him to testify without granting him immunity?\r\n\r\n       \"4. By what witness do you expect to convict Gallagher of\r\n       giving a bribe, or Tom Lonergan, or any other Supervisor of\r\n       accepting a bribe in the matter of fixing the gas rate, or in\r\n       the Home Telephone Company franchise matter?\r\n\r\n       \"5. If you prosecute Ruef for giving money to Gallagher to\r\n       distribute to the Supervisors to influence their vote on the\r\n       trolley franchise, by what witness, or witnesses, will you\r\n       prove that Ruef gave the money to Gallagher? Will you put\r\n       Gallagher on the stand to prove it, and if so, how will you\r\n       induce him to testify without granting him immunity? Will you\r\n       put Ford on the stand to prove that he gave the money to Ruef,\r\n       and if so, how will you get him to testify without giving him\r\n       immunity? Will you put Fat Calhoun on the stand to prove that\r\n       he gave the money to Ford to give Ruef to give to the\r\n       Supervisors, and if so, how will you induce Pat to testify\r\n       without giving him immunity?\r\n\r\n       \"6. You say that you will prosecute Patrick Calhoun for bribing\r\n       the Supervisors to influence their votes in the matter of the\r\n       trolley franchise. By what witnesses will you prove that the\r\n       money was given to Gallagher or to any of the other Supervisors\r\n       to influence their votes in this matter? Will you prove by Ford\r\n       that he gave the money to Ruef, and if so, how will you induce\r\n       Ford to testify without giving him immunity? Will you prove by\r\n       Ruef that he gave the money to Gallagher to distribute to the\r\n       other Supervisors, and if so, how will you prove it by\r\n       Gallagher without giving him immunity? Will you prove by the\r\n       other Supervisors that they received money from Gallagher, and\r\n       if so, how will you induce each of them to testify without\r\n       giving each of them immunity?\r\n\r\n       \"7. Will you prosecute Frank G. Drum and the other officials of\r\n       the gas company for bribing the Supervisors for fixing the gas\r\n       rates, and if so, how will you prove that the money was paid\r\n       without granting immunity to Ruef and to some or all of the\r\n       Supervisors?\r\n\r\n       \"8. Will you prosecute A. K. Detweiler for bribing the\r\n       Supervisors in the Home Telephone franchise matter, and if so,\r\n       how will you prove your case against him without granting\r\n       immunity to Ruef and to some or all of the members of the Board\r\n       of Supervisors?\r\n\r\n       \"9. Can jurisdiction be conferred on a court by consent, and if\r\n       so, how could you proceed with the Ford trial on a legal\r\n       holiday?\r\n\r\n       \"10. If you found it necessary to grant immunity to either the\r\n       bribe-taker or the bribe-giver in the trolley franchise matter\r\n       to prevent an utter failure of justice and the escape of both\r\n       the bribe-takers and the bribe-givers, to which side will you\r\n       recommend the granting of immunity by the court? Will you\r\n       prosecute the friendless, insignificant Supervisors and grant\r\n       immunity to ex-Attorney-General Tirey L. Ford and his employer,\r\n       Patrick Calhoun, president of the United Railroads of San\r\n       Francisco, or will you recommend that the court shall grant\r\n       immunity to the friendless and insignificant Supervisors in\r\n       order to convict the rich, powerful and influential Patrick\r\n       Calhoun and his general counsel, Tirey L. Ford?\r\n\r\n           \"Yours, etc.,                          FRANCIS J. HENEY.\"\r\n\r\n [330] The Republican convention \"pledged its party and its nominees\r\n       to assist and continue the vigorous prosecution of all persons\r\n       guilty of crime, in whatever walk of life, high or low, in San\r\n       Francisco,\" and \"to incessant and energetic war on graft in\r\n       every form, to the end that this plague may be exterminated\r\n       from the body politic.\"\r\n\r\n       The Union Labor plank on the Graft Prosecution was as follows:\r\n       \"We demand the punishment of all offenders against the law,\r\n       and we pledge our nominee for District Attorney to prosecute\r\n       vigorously all bribers, boodlers and grafters without\r\n       distinction, and particularly do we pledge him to prosecute\r\n       those public officials, confessed criminals, who have been\r\n       guilty of the greatest crime in the city's history, but who\r\n       have been permitted to go unwhipped of justice, and to remain\r\n       outside the walls of the penitentiary behind which they should\r\n       now be imprisoned. We further pledge our nominee for District\r\n       Attorney to abolish private prisons, wholesale 'immunity\r\n       baths,' and all other institutions created for the benefit and\r\n       protection of criminals.\"\r\n\r\n       The Democratic Graft Prosecution plank read: \"We commend the\r\n       work of the prosecution, which has removed from public office\r\n       criminals who have dishonored and debauched our city and has\r\n       secured convictions that must be forever a warning to official\r\n       wrongdoers and those who participate with them in crime; and we\r\n       pledge our support to the prosecution in any effort it may make\r\n       to convict any guilty person.\"\r\n\r\n [331] \"There never would have been doubt anywhere about Taylor's\r\n       successor,\" said the Call In its issue of November 5, \"if it\r\n       had not been for the grossly selfish and unpatriotic course of\r\n       Daniel A. Ryan. The one possibility of McCarthy's election was\r\n       opened to him by Ryan. Failing of other support, Ryan turned\r\n       renegade to all his party professions and went into an\r\n       infamous alliance with that arch enemy of Republicanism,\r\n       Hearst. For four weeks he has been scrambling for votes....\r\n       Ryan has fully revealed himself as a cheap politician itching\r\n       for office. He has boasted of his youth, and yet he was the\r\n       first of the candidates to break down and go to bed. He has\r\n       declaimed about his own honesty, until his voice is in tatters\r\n       and has filled the air with promises of what he would do if\r\n       elected. Never has he explained or attempted to explain the\r\n       nature of those 'certain concessions' that led him to nominate\r\n       himself, although he knew that in so doing he was Jeopardizing\r\n       the future of his city.\"\r\n\r\n [332] Said the Chronicle of Mr. Ryan's candidacy in its issue of\r\n       October 3, 1907: \"The Chronicle has neither apologies nor\r\n       regrets for urging its readers to support the Regular\r\n       Republican League movement headed by Daniel A. Ryan. We\r\n       believed at the time, as others believed, that Mr. Ryan's sole\r\n       desire was good government for San Francisco and that such\r\n       desire was unsmirched by personal ambition. General confidence\r\n       in the sincerity of Mr. Ryan and his associates led to the\r\n       triumphant election of the delegates to the Republican\r\n       convention named and approved by Mr. Ryan, which was accepted\r\n       throughout the country as evidence that the people of San\r\n       Francisco were sound at heart.\r\n\r\n       \"When we urged the public to support the Ryan primary tickets,\r\n       we did so, not in the interest of Mr. Ryan, but in the\r\n       interest of good government. We considered Mr. Ryan in the\r\n       light of a useful and public-spirited citizen, upon whom, in\r\n       due time, the people would delight to confer official honors\r\n       should he be willing to accept them. Those who voted the Ryan\r\n       ticket at the primaries did not vote for Mr. Ryan, but for the\r\n       cause which he championed. As for considering him a candidate\r\n       for Mayor, nobody thought of it. It is no disparagement to a\r\n       young man like Mr. Ryan to say that as yet he has no such\r\n       standing in the community as justifies him in aspiring to such\r\n       an honor.\"\r\n\r\n       In its issue of October 5 the Chronicle said: \"The moral\r\n       collapse of Daniel A. Ryan is deeply regretted by every lover\r\n       of San Francisco. It is not a matter of the rise or fall of one\r\n       man. It is a question of whether the people will ever again\r\n       trust any man who appears as a leader of reform. Few men ever\r\n       get such an opportunity as Mr. Ryan has thrown away. Doubtless\r\n       the lesson is for the people never again to trust an unknown\r\n       man. It is not too much to ask of any aspirant to leadership on\r\n       an important scale that he shall have some record of honorable\r\n       achievement of some kind as an earnest of what to expect of him\r\n       should the confidence reposed in him place him in a position of\r\n       power.\"\r\n\r\n [333] The Call, in speaking of the Taylor-Langdon meeting said:\r\n       \"Young Mr. Ryan ought to have been at that meeting. We have\r\n       nothing against Mr. Ryan except that he is not the man of the\r\n       hour. We shall not even reproach him with his youth. That is\r\n       not his fault and he will get over that. But he is not the man\r\n       of the hour. The people have said it. Mr. Ryan embodies no\r\n       principle. To the people of San Francisco he means nothing in\r\n       particular at this critical time. He might have read that\r\n       message in the mighty roar that went up from the meeting in\r\n       welcome of Dr. Taylor. Mayor Taylor stands for something,\r\n       stands for much. Mr. Ryan has only his own ambition and a\r\n       certain command of language.\"\r\n\r\n [334] The San Francisco Call, in its issue of November 5, charged\r\n       that orders had gone out from the United Railroads to \"vote\r\n       for McCarthy and the Union Labor ticket--straight.\" In the\r\n       cars of the United Railroads appeared dodgers which read:\r\n       \"Workingmen. Workingmen--Are you going to put a big stick into\r\n       Spreckels' hands to club you over the head with?\"\r\n\r\n [335] The same is true of the Los Angeles Times, which has a\r\n       national reputation as an opponent of organized labor. The\r\n       Times, while at issue with Mr. McCarthy on the question of the\r\n       desirability of unions, was scarcely less vehement than he in\r\n       denunciation of the San Francisco graft prosecution.\r\n\r\n [336] One of the allegations made against Heney was that he would\r\n       not prosecute Patrick Calhoun, because Heney's brother-in-law\r\n       was employed by Calhoun as a detective. This argument was\r\n       intended to weaken Heney and the prosecution with the union\r\n       element that Calhoun was endeavoring to crush.\r\n\r\n [337] In a political advertisement which appeared in the San\r\n       Francisco Call November 3, 1907, Mr. McGowan said: \"If elected\r\n       District Attorney I will prosecute every man accused of crime,\r\n       regardless of his position in life. I will continue the\r\n       present graft prosecution with more vigor, and the District\r\n       Attorney's office will not be used for politics, nor to\r\n       disturb business. I will be the District Attorney in law and\r\n       in fact, and I will never allow any man or set of men to\r\n       control the office for any purpose. I will honorably enforce\r\n       the law without the aid of any millionaire's money.\"\r\n\r\n [338] Langdon, at the opening of the Republican campaign, took up\r\n       the question of the prosecution's policy in granting immunity\r\n       to the Supervisors. He said:\r\n\r\n       \"In this prosecution we have tried to be practical, to be\r\n       effective. What would you have said if we had made a scapegoat\r\n       of a petty criminal and let the giants go? What would you have\r\n       said if in all this graft and corruption we had arrested and\r\n       jailed two or three obscure Supervisors you had never heard of\r\n       before they came to office, and will never hear of them again\r\n       now that they are retired to private life, and had let escape\r\n       the giants in crime?\r\n\r\n       \"There have been graft exposures before in the history of\r\n       American municipalities and the graft has gone on. And it was\r\n       bound to go on so long as the prosecutions failed to stop the\r\n       sources of evil, to gather into the fold of the penitentiary\r\n       the corrupt men of business and the corrupt political leaders\r\n       who have dared to use weak men for their own ends. These giants\r\n       in crime are perfectly willing that the physical life of the\r\n       weak men they use shall be fed into the jails of the State to\r\n       appease public wrath exactly as they have been willing to use\r\n       up the moral life of these men to satisfy their own greedy\r\n       needs in the Board of Supervisors. Profiting by the mistakes of\r\n       previous prosecutions, this office has struck straight at the\r\n       very roots of public graft: at the crooked public service\r\n       corporations; but which of the criminals were to be allowed to\r\n       give evidence for the State and enjoy its alluring protection;\r\n       the giants of crime who have always been most responsible and\r\n       who have always escaped or the petty, miserable fellows who\r\n       have entered upon these things through ignorance and weakness?\r\n\r\n       \"Immunity had to be given in order that crime might be punished\r\n       and it was given to the Supervisors that the very tap roots of\r\n       political corruption might be torn from the soil in which they\r\n       thrived. We did it because this prosecution has a moral as well\r\n       as a legal significance. It is time to stop the cynicism of\r\n       common men when they view democracy and say it is for the\r\n       powerful and the rich: that the poor must go to jail for the\r\n       theft of bread and the rich escape for the theft of privilege,\r\n       the purchase of men's souls and the degradation of government.\r\n       It is time to stop the brazen and confident effrontery of the\r\n       irresponsible criminal rich, who commit crimes and rest back,\r\n       thinking they can buy judges as they bought legislators and\r\n       executives, and knowing they can buy legal talent to interpose\r\n       every technicality in every courtroom until justice is a human\r\n       travesty tangled in its own web.\r\n\r\n       \"We are after the 'men higher up' because they are the severest\r\n       menace to our institutions, the enduring factors that program\r\n       and bribe each Board of Supervisors as they come and go. We are\r\n       after the 'men higher up' so as to make criminal acquisition\r\n       unprofitable in terms of human desire. We are after the 'men\r\n       higher up' so that young men and women growing up in this and\r\n       other communities will once more believe with ardent fervor not\r\n       only that dishonesty does not pay, but that of all the goods on\r\n       this earth the greatest treasure is a straightforward life.\"\r\n\r\n [339] The vote for Mayor and for District Attorney was as follows:\r\n\r\n               For Mayor--\r\n                     Taylor              28,766\r\n                     Ryan                 9,255\r\n                     McCarthy            17,583\r\n                     Reguin (Soc.)        1,503\r\n\r\n               For District Attorney--\r\n                     Langdon             34,923\r\n                     McGowan             20,115\r\n                     Kirk (Soc.)          1,298\r\n\r\n [340] In commenting upon the outcome of the election, the Examiner,\r\n       in its issue of November 6, said: \"And this revolt of union\r\n       labor against misrepresentation in office began long ago.\r\n       Before the primaries, when most of the registering was done,\r\n       it was observed that the number of Republicans recorded was\r\n       far in excess of the adherents of union labor. The story was\r\n       told then. Disgusted with the dishonesty of the men they had\r\n       placed in office, finding the local Democratic party a mere\r\n       memory, they registered as Republicans because they were\r\n       determined to vote against the representatives of Ruef and\r\n       Schmitz who had captured their organization.\r\n\r\n       \"Langdon's majority will surprise no one. His election was a\r\n       matter of course, for union labor, like all other decent\r\n       elements in the community, was determined to sustain the\r\n       prosecution of the grafters.\r\n\r\n       \"The swing of union labor to Taylor will surprise the gentlemen\r\n       who have been so fond of assuming that the working people would\r\n       vote as a class regardless of principle. The fact that they set\r\n       aside all class feeling, all personal preference, and rolled up\r\n       a big majority in favor of the man considered most likely to\r\n       defeat the zebra-striped bandits who had captured their\r\n       organization proves that government in America is safe in the\r\n       hands of the plain people.\r\n\r\n       \"It is union labor, and union labor chiefly, which has saved\r\n       San Francisco from McCarthy and McGowan.\"\r\n\r\n       \"Yesterday,\" said the Chronicle the morning after the election,\r\n       \"was a great day for San Francisco. It was the turn of the\r\n       tide. It was the beginning of the ascent to nobler ideals and\r\n       better days. The passions of the conflict will soon die away.\r\n       With an honest government assured, capital will not shun us but\r\n       seek us. And we can look back on the events of the last six\r\n       years as we remember a nightmare from which we awake to find\r\n       ourselves in security and peace.\"\r\n\r\n       \"The indicted bribe-givers,\" said the Call, \"may as well make\r\n       up their minds that there is no way of escape for them except\r\n       through trial and by the verdicts of the juries. The people\r\n       have spoken and they have said that the clean-up must be\r\n       thorough. The sweeping success of Langdon means that the\r\n       prosecution of the grafters will be pressed to its fitting\r\n       conclusion upon the facts and under the law. There need be no\r\n       delay now. Soon all the cases should be settled and another\r\n       chapter added to the history of San Francisco--a chapter in\r\n       which will have been written the means, the manner and the\r\n       fullness of our atonement for Schmitz-Ruef chapter just before\r\n       it, the vindication of the city's good name.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n                   HIGHER COURTS FREE SCHMITZ AND RUEF.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 8, 1908, the municipal officials elected with Mayor Taylor\r\nassumed the duties of their office. That day, Ruef was taken from the\r\ncustody of the elisor and locked up in the county jail. In the jail with\r\nhim were Schmitz, convicted of the extortion charge to which Ruef had\r\npleaded guilty, and Glass, who had been convicted of bribery.\r\n\r\nThe following day, January 9, the Appellate Court, for the First\r\nDistrict, handed down a decision in the Schmitz extortion case, which,\r\nlater sustained by the Supreme Court, unlocked the prison doors not only\r\nfor Schmitz, but for Ruef also.[341]\r\n\r\nThe decision was the first serious setback in the graft cases that\r\nDistrict Attorney Langdon's office had received.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution had prevented Ruef seizing the District Attorney's\r\noffice; had defeated the efforts of the defense to have the indicting\r\nGrand Jury declared an invalid body; had overcome the resistance of the\r\ndefendants to facing trial jurors; had, after meeting the clever\r\nopposition of the best legal talent obtainable for money, forced trials\r\nbefore juries and secured convictions; and finally, the prosecution had\r\nmet the defense before the larger jury of The People, and, at the polls,\r\nhad won again. But, with a stroke of the pen, the Appellate Court swept\r\naside the greater part of the accomplishment of fifteen-months struggle\r\nagainst corruption. The court found the indictment under which Schmitz\r\nhad been convicted of extortion to be insufficient and ordered the\r\ndefendant to be discharged as to the indictment.\r\n\r\nIn as much as Ruef, Schmitz's co-defendant, indicted jointly with him\r\nfor extortion, had plead guilty to the same indictment as that under\r\nwhich Schmitz had been convicted, the effect of the decision was to free\r\nRuef as well as Schmitz.\r\n\r\nBefore passing upon the sufficiency of the indictment, the court took\r\noccasion to deal with the points of error as raised by the defense. On\r\nfive principal points the court found that error had been\r\ncommitted.[342] On this showing, the case could have been sent back to\r\nthe Superior Court for re-trial. In that event, Ruef's status would not\r\nhave been affected. But the court went back of the trial to the\r\nindictment, on points raised in the defendant's demurrer, found for the\r\ndefendant, and held the indictment to be insufficient.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of the decision which followed, criticism was confined\r\nalmost exclusively to the court's rulings on the sufficiency of the\r\nindictment. The point raised was that the indictment did not state facts\r\nsufficient to show that any public offense had been committed.\r\n\r\nThe court held in effect that the facts presented did not, under the\r\ndefinitions of the California codes, constitute the crime of extortion.\r\n\r\nIn the California Penal Code[343] extortion is defined as \"the obtaining\r\nof property from another, with his consent, induced by a wrongful use of\r\nforce, or fear or under color of official right.\" The section\r\nfollowing[344] defines \"Fear such as will constitute extortion may be\r\ninduced by a threat either: (1) to do an unlawful injury to the person\r\nor property of the individual threatened, or to any relative of his, or\r\nmember of his family.\"\r\n\r\nThe court found that the threat which induced the fear in the\r\nSchmitz-Ruef extortion cases, was a threat to prevent the parties from\r\nobtaining a liquor license, and thus to prevent them from carrying on\r\nthe business of selling wines and liquors at retail. A license to sell\r\nliquor, the court showed, is not property in the ordinary sense of the\r\nword,[345] but a mere permission, and the license is but the evidence\r\nthat the permission has been given by the proper authorities. \"There is\r\ngrave doubt,\"[346] the court held, \"as to whether a threat to prevent a\r\nparty from obtaining a permission or license by one who has no authority\r\nin the premises, is a threat to injure property within the meaning of\r\nthe sections quoted.\"\r\n\r\nBut the court found it unnecessary to decide this question, for the\r\nreason it held the indictment insufficient \"because it does not allege\r\nnor show that the specific injury threatened was an unlawful\r\ninjury.\"[347]\r\n\r\nTo the man on the street, the reading of the opinion conveyed the\r\nimpression at least, that according to the Appellate Court, when Schmitz\r\nhad shown his power to prevent the French Restaurants getting their\r\nlicenses, thus endangering investments valued as high as $400,000, and\r\nRuef because of the fear engendered by this showing, acting with\r\nSchmitz, had secured large sums of money from the enterprises thus\r\nthreatened, the crime of extortion had not been committed.\r\n\r\nThe decision was received with protest[348] and denunciation. The Call\r\ndubbed it \"bad law, bad logic and bad morals.\" \"Any ordinary\r\nintelligence,\" said The Examiner, \"would construe the threat to take\r\naway a license to sell liquor from a restaurant unless a certain sum of\r\nmoney was paid as the plainest kind of extortion.\"\r\n\r\n\"When,\" said Dr. William Rader of Calvary Presbyterian church, in a\r\nsermon preached on the evening of the Sunday after the decision was made\r\npublic, January 12, 1908, \"extortion is not a crime, when bribery is not\r\neven a wrong, when a confessed felon can learn that he is really\r\nrighteous, and that his trial, confession and conviction have all been\r\nnothing but a mistake--a slight mistake--I repeat that however correct\r\nthis may be legally and ethically, it has the effect of making us stand\r\namazed at the rapid revolutions of the legal wheels. Perhaps tomorrow we\r\nshall learn that this last decision has been a mistake, too. I hope so;\r\nI believe so.\"\r\n\r\n\"We of this city,\" said Rev. Dr. Evans at Grace Episcopal Cathedral,\r\n\"are dumbfounded by a judicial pronouncement which enables the high\r\nofficials of our city to rob and plunder without any technical breaking\r\nof the law. It is enough--such an audacious mockery of the first\r\nprinciples of common sense--to justify the appointment of a lunacy\r\ncommission to inquire into the sanity of men who could formulate such a\r\njudgment and it ought to provoke an explosion of righteous indignation\r\nfrom one end of the State to the other. We need not hesitate to declare\r\nthat such an opinion as this has its inspiration in that place where\r\npublic sentiment without a single dissenting note would give it its\r\nunanimous approval.\"\r\n\r\nThe decision did not immediately release Ruef and Schmitz. The\r\nprosecution had still an appeal to the Supreme Court for a re-hearing\r\nand, pending such an appeal, the defendants remained behind the bars.\r\nThis delay annoyed those interested in seeing the graft defendants go\r\nfree. Stories were circulated that the prosecution would not appeal. But\r\nthe prosecution did appeal. Three months later, the Supreme Court\r\nrendered its decision.[349]\r\n\r\nThe decision was against the prosecution.\r\n\r\n\"The (Supreme) court is unanimous in the opinion,\" the decision read,\r\n\"that the District Court of Appeal was correct in its conclusion that\r\nthe indictment was insufficient, in that it did not show that the\r\nspecific injury to the property of the restaurant-keepers threatened by\r\nthe defendant was an 'unlawful injury.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court went a step further than the Appellate Court had done\r\nand attacked the indictment on the ground that it had not set forth that\r\nSchmitz was Mayor at the time of the alleged extortion, nor that Ruef\r\nwas a political boss practically in control of the municipal government.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution in its application for a rehearing had set forth that\r\n\"it will be found and decided by this court that levying blackmail upon\r\nlicensed businesses by the Mayor and the political boss of a\r\nmetropolitan community is a crime under the law of California and should\r\nnot go unwhipped of justice.\"\r\n\r\nThis observation was denounced in the Supreme Court's decision as \"a\r\ngross misstatement of the case and of the question to be decided as\r\npresented by the indictment.\"\r\n\r\n\"We again emphasize the fact,\" reads the opinion, \"that the indictment\r\ndoes not aver that Schmitz was Mayor, or that Ruef was a political boss,\r\nor that either of them had any power, or influence, or control over the\r\nPolice Commissioners, or that they threatened to use such power,\r\ninfluence or control in preventing the issuance of a license.\"\r\n\r\nThe storm of protest with which this opinion was received was even\r\ngreater than that which followed the Appellate Court decision. Once more\r\ndid press, pulpit and public, from one end of the State to the other,\r\njoin in expression of indignation.\r\n\r\nThe court in return insisted that it was misrepresented and\r\nmisunderstood. Chief Justice W. H. Beatty essayed the task of writing an\r\nexplanation of the ruling, that \"the man on the street\" might\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice's article appeared in the Sacramento Bee of April 29,\r\n1908.[350] Again was the omission from the indictment of the fact that\r\nSchmitz was Mayor and Ruef a boss, emphasized.[351] And again, it may\r\nbe added, did the stupid man on the street fail to understand. In fact,\r\ndisapproval of the decision continued. Heney attacked it respectfully in\r\ntone, but with sharp criticism.[352]\r\n\r\nJames M. Kerr,[353] in his Cyclopedia Penal Code of California,\r\npublished in 1908, declared in effect that in the Schmitz decision the\r\nSupreme Court of California formulated bad law and advocated bad\r\npleading.\r\n\r\nAs for Ruef's position as a political boss, Kerr contended, it was\r\nmerely a matter of evidence, and not a matter to be pleaded. \"The\r\nSupreme Court,\" concludes the law writer, \"seems to lose sight of the\r\nfact that the crime of extortion in this State is not confined to\r\npersons in office and exercising official influence.\"\r\n\r\nDean John H. Wigmore of the Northwestern University School of Law, and\r\nauthor of the standard work, Wigmore on Evidence, in a crushing\r\ncriticism of the decision and the various documents in the case,\r\ncharged the Chief Justice with being \"plainly inconsistent.\"\r\n\r\n\"The truth is,\" said Dean Wigmore, \"that the learned Chief Justice in\r\nendeavoring to support his decision weaves a logical web and then\r\nentangles himself in it.\"[354] The moral of the Schmitz decision is,\r\nDean Wigmore concludes, \"that our profession must be educated out of\r\nsuch vicious habits of thought.\"\r\n\r\nThe extravagance of the criticism of the decision was more than equaled\r\nby the claims made by the opposition to the prosecution, of its effect\r\nupon the status of Schmitz and Ruef.\r\n\r\n\"Schmitz,\" said a writer in The Chronicle, \"is now thoroughly\r\nexonerated of the charge of having squeezed money from Malfanti, the\r\nFrench-restaurant man.\"\r\n\r\nHowever this may have been, the practical result of the decision was\r\nthat both Schmitz and Ruef, with no convictions against them, by\r\nfurnishing bonds in the bribery cases, were able to walk out of prison.\r\n\r\nSchmitz did not return as a prisoner. Ruef enjoyed his liberty until\r\nNovember, 1908.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [341] The opinion was written by Justice Cooper and concurred in by\r\n       Justices Hall and Kerrigan. This is the same Kerrigan who\r\n       appears in the Santa Cruz banquet scene picture, in which Ruef\r\n       occupies the position of honor with the Republican nominee for\r\n       Governor, J. M. Gillett, standing at his back with hand\r\n       resting on Ruef's shoulder. (See Chapter IV.)\r\n\r\n       Supreme Justice Henshaw, whose sensational action in Ruef's\r\n       favor will appear in another chapter, is also one of the Santa\r\n       Cruz banquet group.\r\n\r\n [342] The Appellate Court enumerated the following errors at the\r\n       trial:\r\n\r\n       (1) That the trial court erred in allowing the peremptory\r\n       challenge of a juror after he had been sworn to try the case;\r\n       and the removal, after he had been sworn, of a second juror\r\n       without cause.\r\n\r\n       (2) That error was committed in the appointment of the elisor\r\n       that had charge of the jury.\r\n\r\n       (3) That the court erred in admitting hearsay evidence of\r\n       witnesses, Loupe, Blanco, Malfanti, Debret and Rosenthal.\r\n\r\n       (4) That error was committed when Schmitz was required, under\r\n       cross-examination, to answer question as to whether he had\r\n       received from Ruef part of the money extorted from the French\r\n       restaurant keepers.\r\n\r\n       (5) That Ruef's testimony that he had divided the money with\r\n       Schmitz was not proper rebuttal evidence.\r\n\r\n [343] California Penal Code, Sec. 518.\r\n\r\n [344] California Penal Code, Sec. 519.\r\n\r\n [345] The general feeling regarding the Schmitz decision was well\r\n       expressed by Attorney J. C. Hutchinson, in a letter to Justice\r\n       Cooper. The letter follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Hon. James A. Cooper, Presiding Justice of the District Court\r\n       of Appeals, First District, 1420 Sutter street, city. Dear\r\n       Sir: Yours of the 15th inst. received. I did not expect you to\r\n       reply to mine of the 13th inst., which was more in the nature\r\n       of an ejaculatory protest than a letter. Nevertheless, I think\r\n       you are right to reply, especially as I know you have replied\r\n       to letters complimenting you on the same decision.\r\n\r\n       \"I have never before written a letter to a judge commenting\r\n       upon a decision in which he had taken part, and I ordinarily\r\n       would consider such a course highly unprofessional. During\r\n       twenty-five years' practice, I have always remained silent in\r\n       the face of decisions, however adverse, even in some cases\r\n       where I was perfectly well aware that improper influences\r\n       behind the scenes had prevented me from obtaining justice. But\r\n       in this case the situation is different from anything I have\r\n       ever experienced. The very air seems to be full of\r\n       revolutionary feeling. At the universities, clubs, in the\r\n       trains, on the streets and in the home, I find no one (except\r\n       the friends, connections and lawyers of the grafters) speak\r\n       with anything but emphatic protest against this decision so far\r\n       as it relates to the validity of the indictment.\r\n\r\n       \"I have cast no personal reflection upon yourself. The attack\r\n       is upon the atmospheric environment of a statement which could\r\n       lead a man of your integrity and intelligence honestly to\r\n       believe that such a decision could be correct; and if the\r\n       Supreme Court should unanimously hold the same, that would,\r\n       according to my view, only make the matter so much the worse.\r\n\r\n       \"Very respectfully yours,\r\n                                                  \"J. C. HUTCHINSON.\"\r\n\r\n [346] See 7 Cal. App. Reports, page 330.\r\n\r\n [347] The Court, in discussing this point, said: \"The indictment\r\n       does use the words 'unlawful injury' in the first part of it;\r\n       but when the facts are specifically set forth as to what the\r\n       defendants threatened to do we find that the threat was that\r\n       defendants 'would prevent the said Joseph Malfanti, Charles\r\n       Kelb and William Lafrenz from receiving said license or\r\n       obtaining the same.' There is no allegation that any unlawful\r\n       act was threatened, and the attorneys for the prosecution\r\n       frankly admit that they rely upon the fact that the defendants\r\n       obtained the money by threatening to do an injury, which they\r\n       claim was unlawful solely for the reason that the threats were\r\n       made with intent to extort money. In other words, it is\r\n       claimed that even though the French-restaurant proprietors\r\n       were violating the law, and conducting immoral places used as\r\n       resorts by lewd women, and thus not legally entitled to a\r\n       license to sell liquor, a threat to prevent the issuance of\r\n       licenses to such places by laying the facts before the Board\r\n       of Police Commissioners in a legal manner, constitutes a crime\r\n       if such threat was made with the intent to extort money. Such,\r\n       in our opinion, is not the law. The statute uses the words\r\n       that the threat must be to do 'an unlawful injury'; and in\r\n       order to charge a crime the indictment must aver in some way\r\n       that the threat was to do an unlawful injury. It is apparent\r\n       from the language of the statute which we have hereinbefore\r\n       quoted, that it is not every kind of fear that will support a\r\n       charge of extortion because of property obtained thereby. The\r\n       fear must be induced by one of the threats enumerated in the\r\n       statute. The Legislature has seen fit to provide that the\r\n       threatened injury to property upon which a charge of extortion\r\n       may be predicated must be an unlawful injury to property. That\r\n       is, the injury threatened must be, in itself, unlawful,\r\n       irrespective of the purpose with which the threat is made. As\r\n       the word 'unlawful' is used in the statute it qualifies the\r\n       'injury' and not the 'threat.' Unlawful means contrary to law.\r\n       It is true that from a high standard of ethics it could not be\r\n       claimed that one could extort money by a threat to do a lawful\r\n       act, if the intent was to get money by the use of the threat,\r\n       but every wrong is not made a crime. There are many wrongs\r\n       done every day that are not enumerated in the category of\r\n       crimes contained in the Penal Code that are of much more\r\n       serious consequence in their nature than others which are\r\n       defined therein; but we must look to the statute to find\r\n       whether or not an act is a public offense for which a\r\n       prosecution will lie. To procure property from others by a\r\n       mere threat to do a lawful act is not a crime. The object of\r\n       the statute--or at least one of its objects--is to protect the\r\n       party from whom the property is extorted; and if such party\r\n       pays the money in order to secure protection in violating the\r\n       law himself he cannot be heard to complain. He in such case\r\n       would be a party to the violation of the law. In this case, if\r\n       the parties as a fact paid the money in order to prevent the\r\n       evidence as to the character of places they kept from being\r\n       exposed to the Board of Police Commissioners, they are not in\r\n       a position to complain.\"\r\n\r\n [348] The Examiner, in its issue of January 11, 1908, said of the\r\n       decision:\r\n\r\n       \"The District Court of Appeal has overturned the conviction of\r\n       Mayor Schmitz on the ground that threatening to prevent the\r\n       French-restaurant keepers from getting a license to sell\r\n       liquor does not constitute the crime of extortion, with which\r\n       he is charged. This is one of the decisions that will\r\n       aggravate the dissatisfaction of the public with the courts.\r\n\r\n       \"Abe Ruef, once political boss of San Francisco, testified that\r\n       he had divided with the Mayor the 'fees' for getting the\r\n       licenses which Schmitz had held up until the money was paid. 'A\r\n       license to sell liquor is not property in the ordinary sense of\r\n       the word,' declares the court, making the point that the\r\n       indictment 'does not allege any threat to injure property.'\r\n\r\n       \"Any ordinary intelligence would construe the threat to take\r\n       away a license to sell liquor from a restaurant unless a\r\n       certain sum of money was paid as the plainest kind of\r\n       extortion, particularly when the Mayor was shown to have shared\r\n       in the money thus exacted, and the fact that the contrary\r\n       ruling of a court acts as a release of a man whose guilt was\r\n       clearly established, will not change that view.\"\r\n\r\n       \"Even the lay mind,\" said the Call, \"is competent to reach the\r\n       conclusion that this decision is bad law, bad logic and had\r\n       morals.\"\r\n\r\n       The decision was generally condemned by the interior press. The\r\n       Sacramento Bee denounced it as a \"palpable evasion of justice.\"\r\n       The Oakland Enquirer stated that it came as a \"shock and a\r\n       surprise to the law-respecting people of California and of the\r\n       entire country.\" \"San Francisco in particular,\" said the Los\r\n       Angeles Evening News, \"California in general and the republic\r\n       at large have suffered great wrong by reason of this\r\n       reprehensible decision.\"\r\n\r\n [349] See California Appellate Reports, in which the Supreme Court\r\n       decision is printed, Vol. No. 7, Page 369.\r\n\r\n [350] The Bee prefaced the Chief Justice's article with the\r\n       following statement: \"The decision of the Supreme Court of\r\n       California in the case of Eugene Schmitz is one not only of\r\n       State but even of national importance. It has been the\r\n       fruitful topic of varied comment throughout the Union. And\r\n       yet, after all the discussion, there remains a prevailing\r\n       ignorance as to WHAT WAS DECIDED; and even among those laymen\r\n       who had a fair idea upon that point, there is certainly little\r\n       if any knowledge as to WHY IT WAS SO DECIDED.\r\n\r\n       \"Having a very high idea of the granitic probity of Chief\r\n       Justice Beatty of the Supreme Court, and believing it to be\r\n       the duty of that Court to answer when citizens respectfully\r\n       ask for light, the editor of this paper on March 31st last\r\n       wrote to Chief Justice Beatty and asked him to publicly\r\n       explain just what the Court had decided and just why it had so\r\n       decided; to explain it so that the man in the street might\r\n       easily understand. In that quite lengthy letter to the Chief\r\n       Justice, the editor of The Bee wrote:\r\n\r\n       \"'The ignorance of the general public as to what was decided\r\n       and exactly why it was decided has undoubtedly given rise to\r\n       considerable of a public suspicion that all is not as it should\r\n       be--that injustice has triumphed where justice should have\r\n       prevailed--that the good work of almost two years has been\r\n       practically wiped out by a judicial obeisance to\r\n       technicalities--that the guilty have been saved by the\r\n       interposition of a judicial hand that could with more propriety\r\n       and equally as much regard for the law have turned the scales\r\n       to record the verdict of the highest tribunal on the side of\r\n       good government.'\r\n\r\n       \"Justice Beatty answers the questions at length, but with such\r\n       clearness that the 'man in the street' can understand. His\r\n       explanation should be read by everybody, so that hereafter\r\n       those who discuss the matter can do so with a full and thorough\r\n       understanding of exactly what the Supreme Court decided in the\r\n       Schmitz case, and exactly why it considered it had so to\r\n       decide.\"\r\n\r\n [351] \"I repeat,\" said the Chief Justice in his Bee article, \"that\r\n       the only question presented for decision was the question of\r\n       statutory construction here stated, for it was never seriously\r\n       contended before the Supreme Court by the Attorney General, or\r\n       by the District Attorney of San Francisco, or by any of his\r\n       assistants or deputies, or by the learned counsel, whose names\r\n       are signed to the petition for a rehearing, that the\r\n       indictment did allege a threat to do an unlawful injury of the\r\n       character indicated. What it did allege on this point, and all\r\n       that it alleged, was that one E. E. Schmitz (without showing\r\n       that he was Mayor of the city, or that he had any official or\r\n       other influence over the Board of Police Commissioners greater\r\n       than, or different from, that of the humblest private\r\n       citizen), and one Abraham Ruef (without showing that he had\r\n       any such power or influence) had told certain keepers of a\r\n       restaurant that they could, and had threatened that they\r\n       would, prevent them from obtaining a renewal of their license\r\n       to sell liquors, etc. The indictment, in other words, had no\r\n       more force in legal contemplation than if it had been directed\r\n       against Jack Stiles and Richard Noakes, for though the facts\r\n       that Schmitz was Mayor and Ruef the political boss of the city\r\n       may have been as notorious in San Francisco as the fire or\r\n       earthquake, no lawyer would contend for a moment that they\r\n       were facts of which a court could take judicial notice in\r\n       passing upon the sufficiency of the indictment.\"\r\n\r\n [352] Heney's reply to Chief Justice Beatty was published in The\r\n       Sacramento Bee. Section 961 of the California Penal Code\r\n       expressly provides that no fact of which a court may take\r\n       judicial notice, need be alleged in any indictment. The Codes\r\n       enumerate certain matters of which the courts are required to\r\n       take judicial notice. Among the matters are \"State offices and\r\n       their incumbents.\" The Political Code defines who are \"State\r\n       officers,\" and among them are included \"Mayors of Cities.\"\r\n       Heney, in his reply, held Chief Justice Beatty and the court\r\n       to be wrong, even on the face of the statute. No lawyer in the\r\n       State attempted to answer Heney's reply, although many of them\r\n       would have been glad to have earned recognition from the\r\n       Supreme Court by doing so.\r\n\r\n [353] James M. Kerr is author of Kerr's California Cyclopedic Codes.\r\n       These works are accepted as standards throughout the country.\r\n\r\n       \"It is thought,\" says Kerr in California Cyclopedic Codes for\r\n       1908, \"that ... the [Schmitz] case cannot be safely relied\r\n       upon as an authority outside of California. It is a flagrant\r\n       violation of the spirit if not the letter of Section 4 ante,\r\n       and the old rule that it is the duty of the court, where it is\r\n       possible, so to construe the statute as to uphold the\r\n       indictment and promote justice, instead of effecting a\r\n       miscarriage of justice. Several things occur in connection\r\n       with a consideration of the foregoing quotation from the\r\n       Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n       \"1. If an indictment can lawfully be upheld, the court, as the\r\n       judicial voice of the State, is bound so to uphold it. It is\r\n       not the province of the court to seek some strained view of the\r\n       law by which an indictment of one accused of crime can be\r\n       quashed.\r\n\r\n       \"2. The construction of the code provision on extortion is to\r\n       be made, not technically, but according to the fair import of\r\n       its terms, with a view to its object and to promote justice.\r\n\r\n       \"3. It is not charged, and the statute does not require it to\r\n       be charged, that the threat was made by Schmitz, acting in his\r\n       official capacity. The crime of extortion, under our statute,\r\n       is not the old common-law crime of extortion, which could be\r\n       committed only by an official acting in his official capacity.\r\n       Under our statute it is immaterial whether Schmitz held any\r\n       official position, or whether Schmitz and Ruef had any power or\r\n       influence to carry out the threat; the only thing to be\r\n       considered is, Did the accused extort money by means of a\r\n       threat? Official position or power to carry out the threat is\r\n       neither material nor proper.\r\n\r\n       \"4. It is entirely immaterial by what means Schmitz and Ruef\r\n       intended to accomplish their threat to have the liquor license\r\n       withheld; whether by fair persuasion of the Board of\r\n       Supervisors, or by menace, duress, fraud, or undue influence.\r\n       The crime charged did not consist in the dealings with the\r\n       Board of Supervisors, but in the threat made to the French\r\n       restaurateurs, by means of which the fears of the latter were\r\n       aroused, and were forced to pay to Schmitz and Ruef money to\r\n       which the latter were not entitled, as a means of preventing\r\n       Schmitz and Ruef from carrying out the threat. To require the\r\n       indictment to contain an allegation of the means intended to be\r\n       used by Schmitz and Ruef to accomplish their unlawful\r\n       purpose--the means to be used with, or to influence, or to\r\n       menace, or duress, or fraud in dealing with, the Board of\r\n       Supervisors--is indubitably bad law and bad pleading.\r\n\r\n       \"5. The declaration that the case 'is not one which is\r\n       sufficient to charge an offense in the language of the statute\r\n       defining it,' made by the court, needs some reason and good\r\n       authorities to make it good law outside of this State, and also\r\n       in this State under the system of criminal pleading provided\r\n       for by the code--which should be the law by which criminal\r\n       pleading is to be measured.\r\n\r\n       \"6. It does not seem to have been suggested to the court, and\r\n       it does not seem to have occurred to the learned judges\r\n       thereof, that the trial court was required to take judicial\r\n       notice of the head of department of a co-ordinate department of\r\n       the government of the City and County of San Francisco, and to\r\n       take judicial notice of the fact that Schmitz was at least de\r\n       facto Mayor. See Kerr's Cyc. Code Civ. Proc., Sec. 1875, Subd.\r\n       5.\r\n\r\n       \"7. The position and practical control of Ruef, as the\r\n       'political boss' of San Francisco (a position unrecognized by\r\n       law), and his undue influence over the Board of Supervisors\r\n       (the exercise of which is contrary to public policy), was\r\n       merely matter of evidence, and not a matter to be pleaded; the\r\n       only thing that is important is, Was the threat made? and did\r\n       the defendants, Schmitz and Ruef, through such threat, extort\r\n       money, and by means of the fear raised thereby? If they did, it\r\n       is utterly immaterial whether Schmitz was Mayor, or Ruef was a\r\n       'political boss,' and had or had not any influence with the\r\n       Board of Supervisors. The Supreme Court seems to lose sight of\r\n       the fact that the crime of extortion in this State is not\r\n       confined to persons in office, and exercising official\r\n       influence.\r\n\r\n       \"8. A threat to do a lawful act, if made for the purpose of\r\n       putting a person in fear, and thereby securing money or\r\n       property which the person was not in law entitled to have and\r\n       receive, renders such person guilty of extortion, under the\r\n       weight of decision and the better doctrine; and taking the case\r\n       in that view, the indictment is amply sufficient, and should\r\n       have been upheld by the court. The case of Boyson vs. Thorn, 98\r\n       Cal., 578; 33 Pac. Rep., 492, has no application, and its\r\n       citation by the court only tends to befog the issue.\"\r\n\r\n [354] Dean Wigmore's criticism of the decisions in the Schmitz case,\r\n       and of the articles written in defense of them was as follows:\r\n       \"I have read the letter of Mr. Heney, and the letter of the\r\n       Chief Justice, and have re-read the opinion of the Court in\r\n       People vs. Schmitz, 94 Pac. Rep. 419. The Chief Justice's\r\n       letter and Mr. Heney's reply turn largely on the legal rule of\r\n       judicial notice. The learned Chief Justice finds himself\r\n       iron-bound by the rules of that subject. But the whole spirit\r\n       of the rules is misconceived by him. Their essential and sole\r\n       purpose is to relieve the party from proof,--that is, from\r\n       proof of facts which are so notorious as not to need proof.\r\n       When a party has not averred or evidenced a fact which later\r\n       turns out, in the Supreme Court's opinion, to be vital, the\r\n       rule of judicial notice helps out the judge by permitting him\r\n       to take the fact as true, where it is one so notorious that\r\n       evidence of it would have been superfluous. Now these helping\r\n       rules are not intended to bind him, but the contrary, i.e.,\r\n       to make him free to take the fact as proved where he knows the\r\n       proof was not needed. Moreover, it follows that, since these\r\n       rules cannot foresee every case that new times and new\r\n       conditions will create, they can always receive new\r\n       applications. The precedents of former judges, in noticing\r\n       specific facts, do not restrict present judges from noticing\r\n       new facts, provided only that the new fact is notorious to all\r\n       the community. For example, the unquestioned election of\r\n       William H. Taft as President of the United States is\r\n       notorious; but no man named William H. Taft has ever been\r\n       elected President, and no judicial precedent has noticed the\r\n       fact. But no court would hesitate to notice this new notorious\r\n       fact.\r\n\r\n       \"If, then, a man named Schmitz was notoriously Mayor of San\r\n       Francisco and a man named Ruef was notoriously its political\r\n       boss, at the time in question, that is all that any court\r\n       needs; and the doctrine of judicial notice gives it all the\r\n       liberty it needs. It is conceivable that a trial judge might\r\n       sometimes hesitate in applying this doctrine of notoriety,\r\n       because the trial court might fear that the Supreme Court\r\n       would not perceive the notoriety. But there never need be any\r\n       such hesitation in a Supreme Court, if that court does see the\r\n       notoriety.\r\n\r\n       \"And this is just where the learned Chief Justice is to be\r\n       criticised. He does not for a moment ask or answer the\r\n       question, 'Did we actually, as men and officers, believe these\r\n       facts to be notoriously so?' but refers to certain mechanical\r\n       rules, external to his mind. What that Supreme Court should\r\n       have done was to decide whether they under the circumstances\r\n       did actually believe the facts about the status of Schmitz and\r\n       Ruef to be notorious. In not so doing, they erred against the\r\n       whole spirit and principle of judicial notice.\r\n\r\n       \"And Mr. Heney's demonstration that there is nothing in the\r\n       codes to forbid them is complete; for, of course, the Code of\r\n       Procedure, in tellingto do the right thingto do the right thing\r\n       them (Section 1875) that 'the courts take judicial notice of the\r\n       following facts,' simply gave them a liberty of belief as to\r\n       those specified facts, and did not take away their liberty as to\r\n       other unspecified facts.\r\n\r\n       \"But there is a deeper error than this in the learned Chief\r\n       Justice's letter, and in the court's opinion. The letter says:\r\n       'If by means of these allegations or otherwise it had been\r\n       made to appear that the defendants had caused the applicants\r\n       to believe that they could and would influence the Police\r\n       Commissioners to reject their application regardless of its\r\n       merits I have never doubted that the indictment would have been\r\n       sufficient.' He stakes his decision on this point. The point is\r\n       that, in determining the fear caused by the threat, which\r\n       constituted extortion, the belief of the restaurant-keeper as\r\n       to Schmitz's and Ruef's power, and not their actual power, was\r\n       the essential thing. If that is so, then of what consequence\r\n       was it whether one or the other was Mayor or boss? And of what\r\n       consequence was it whether those facts were averred or judicially\r\n       noticed. None at all. The indictment alleged that the threats\r\n       were made to use influence or power over the Commissioners,\r\n       and that their purpose was to obtain money by means of (i.e.,\r\n       through fear of) such threats. Obviously, then, the actual\r\n       power or influence was immaterial; and the belief of the\r\n       restaurant-keeper, the only material fact, was a question of\r\n       the evidence on the trial, and not of the legal sufficiency of\r\n       the indictment. All the lucubrations about judicial notice were\r\n       therefore beside the point.\r\n\r\n       \"The inconsistency of the learned Chief Justice, in thus taking\r\n       as essential the actual status of Schmitz and Ruef, is further\r\n       seen in his next paragraph. There he declares 'it could not be\r\n       assumed that such private persons could prevent the issuance of\r\n       the license otherwise than by adducing good reasons.' But why\r\n       does he assume that, on the contrary, a threat by a Mayor or a\r\n       boss could prevent the issuance of the license otherwise than\r\n       by adducing good reasons? He says that if it had appeared that\r\n       the threats were made by a Mayor and a boss, then this would\r\n       have sufficed, because, in his own words, their influence to\r\n       reject the application would have been used 'regardless of its\r\n       merits.' See what this means. Suppose that two persons, a Mayor\r\n       and a private citizen, tell a restaurant-keeper that they will\r\n       do all they can to induce a Commissioner to revoke the license\r\n       unless money is paid; for one of these persons, the learned\r\n       Chief Justice immediately assumes that he can and will do this\r\n       'regardless of its merits'; for the other he says 'it cannot be\r\n       assumed.' Why not for one as much or as little as the other? He\r\n       does not say that the private person could not possibly succeed\r\n       in influencing the Commissioner corruptly--he merely says that\r\n       'it cannot be assumed.' On the other hand, why assume it for\r\n       the Mayor? Surely a Mayor might fail in trying to influence an\r\n       honest Commissioner by a corrupt threat to remove him. In\r\n       short, either assume that on the facts of the trial a private\r\n       person might have power to influence corruptly the license; in\r\n       which case an allegation of his Mayoralty would be superfluous.\r\n       Or else refuse to assume that a Mayor, merely as such, could\r\n       and would inevitably influence a Commissioner corruptly; in\r\n       which case the mere allegation of his being Mayor would not be\r\n       enough, and judicial notice would not cure. But the Chief\r\n       Justice says it would be enough! He is plainly inconsistent.\r\n\r\n       \"The truth is that the learned Chief Justice, in endeavoring to\r\n       support his decision, weaves a logical web, and then entangles\r\n       himself in it.\r\n\r\n       \"Such disputations were the life of scholarship and of the law\r\n       six hundred years ago. They are out of place today. There are\r\n       enough rules of law to sustain them, if the court wants to do\r\n       so. And there are enough rules of law to brush them away, if\r\n       the court wants to do that.\r\n\r\n       \"All the rules in the world will not get us substantial justice\r\n       if the judges have not the correct living moral attitude toward\r\n       substantial justice.\r\n\r\n       \"We do not doubt that there are dozens of other Supreme\r\n       Justices who would decide, and are today deciding, in obscure\r\n       cases, just such points in just the same way as the California\r\n       case. And we do not doubt there are hundreds of lawyers whose\r\n       professional habit of mind would make them decide just that way\r\n       if they were elevated to the bench tomorrow in place of those\r\n       other anachronistic jurists who are now there. The moral is\r\n       that our profession must be educated out of such vicious habits\r\n       of thought. One way to do this is to let the newer Ideas be\r\n       dinned into their professional consciousness by public\r\n       criticism and private conversation.\r\n\r\n       \"The Schmitz-Ruef case will at least have been an ill-wind\r\n       blowing good to somebody if it helps to achieve that result.\r\n\r\n       \"December 7, 1908.\r\n                                                  \"JOHN H.

Abe Ruef, who had been counted, by the public at\r\nleast, as friendly to the prosecution, openly broke with the District\r\nAttorney and his associates.\r\n\r\nPresident Calhoun of the United Railroads, who had been in the East,\r\nreturned to San Francisco demanding trial. The San Francisco Examiner,\r\nnow openly opposing the prosecution, announced this new move to be a\r\nbomb-shell thrown in the prosecution's camp. Nevertheless, The Examiner\r\ncould not entirely conceal the astonishment caused by the defense's new\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\"Just what has brought about this change in Calhoun's attitude,\" said\r\nthe Examiner in its issue of January 28, 1908, \"was not explained\r\nyesterday. Tactics of evasion, motions of obstruction, and every other\r\nartifice known to legal legerdemain to stay proceedings have heretofore\r\nbeen the accepted etiquette of the graft defendants, and conspicuously\r\nthat of Patrick Calhoun.\"\r\n\r\nThe Call, supporting the prosecution, boldly charged that the graft\r\ndefendants were in treaty with Ruef.[356] And this view the District\r\nAttorney's office was finally forced to accept.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the decision of the Appellate Court been made public than\r\nRuef clamored for dismissal of the extortion charge to which he had\r\nplead guilty, but which the higher court had decided in the Schmitz case\r\ndid not constitute a public offense. In this Ruef was backed by Rabbis\r\nNieto and Kaplan.\r\n\r\nRuef, after the Schmitz-Ruef officials had been swept out of office, had\r\nbeen confined in the county jail. From the day of his jail imprisonment\r\nthe two Rabbis besought the District Attorney day and night[357] not to\r\nforce the broken boss to remain behind the bars.[358]\r\n\r\nLangdon, not having decided at the time to appeal from the Appellate\r\nCourt decision to the Supreme Court, finally yielded to the\r\nimportunities of the two clergy-men and stated to Judge Dunne that Ruef\r\nwanted to make a motion to withdraw his plea of guilty in the extortion\r\ncase. Judge Dunne replied that he would not consider such motion.[359]\r\n\r\nThis closed the incident so far as dismissal of the case before the\r\nSupreme Court could pass upon it, was concerned. But it did not stop\r\nRuef's insistence that not only should he be allowed to withdraw his\r\nplea of guilty, but that he be given complete immunity from prosecution\r\nof all the charges against him.\r\n\r\nLangdon, even before he had spoken to Judge Dunne about permitting Ruef\r\nto withdraw his plea, had become convinced, as Heney had become\r\nconvinced long before, that Ruef was not playing fair with the\r\nprosecution. Ruef, when confronted with charges of holding back\r\nevidence, shifted and evaded, until Langdon, losing patience, charged\r\nhim with falsehood.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of January, evidence came into Langdon's\r\npossession[360] which convinced him beyond a shadow of a doubt that\r\nRuef, instead of observing the immunity contract, was, as a matter of\r\nfact, dealing with and assisting his co-defendants, advising them of\r\nevery move.\r\n\r\nLangdon[361] at once called Ruef before him and notified him that the\r\nimmunity contract was canceled.[362]\r\n\r\nThe abrogation of the immunity contract brought open break between Ruef\r\nand the prosecution. Ruef set up claim that under his immunity contract\r\nall the graft cases were to be dismissed against him, including that\r\nunder which he had plead guilty to extortion. He insisted that he had\r\nlived up to his part of the agreement and charged that the prosecution\r\nwas breaking faith.\r\n\r\nIn this position, Ruef was backed up by Rabbis Kaplan and Nieto, who for\r\nmonths had been clamorously active in his behalf. Indeed, long before\r\nthe open breach had come, so persistent had the Rabbis become in their\r\ninsistence that Ruef be released, that Heney had found it necessary to\r\nrequest Kaplan to remain away from his office.[363] When Ruef finally\r\nbroke with the prosecution, the two Rabbis were to the fore backing up\r\nhis contention that the prosecution was not keeping faith with him.[364]\r\n\r\nKaplan soon after filed an affidavit setting forth that under the\r\nagreement with the prosecution, Ruef was to have had complete immunity,\r\nand be allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty in the extortion case.\r\nLater on, Nieto, \"Ruef's diplomatic middle man,\" as he was called, filed\r\nan affidavit to the same effect. Ruef, on his part, filed a voluminous\r\naffidavit, purporting to cover all his transactions with the\r\nprosecution, in which he not only set up the claim that he was to have\r\nbeen given complete immunity but alleged that Langdon, Heney and Burns,\r\nwere guilty of subornation of perjury in having endeavored to get him to\r\nswear falsely against Schmitz and Ford.\r\n\r\nRabbis Kaplan and Nieto, in their affidavits gave versions of the\r\nmeetings with Judges Dunne and Lawlor, when the Judges stated their\r\nconfidence in the District Attorney and his assistants, which differed\r\nfrom the accounts contained in the affidavit of Heney and the\r\njudges.[365] This brought the trial judges as well as the assistant\r\nprosecuting attorney into the controversy.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Grand Jury that had indicted the graft defendants had\r\nalready had their trials in open court;[366] petit jurors and witnesses\r\nhad, in effect, been on trial also. And now District Attorney and trial\r\njudges were placed on their defense.[367]\r\n\r\nOther graft defendants joined in the upholding of Ruef and the\r\ndenunciation of the prosecution. Adverse newspapers joined in the cry of\r\nunfairness and hinted at worse. The story became current that no appeal\r\nwould be made from the Appellate Court's decision in the Schmitz case to\r\nthe Supreme Court. Another story had it that the prosecution was\r\nbreaking down, that the situation had become so complicated that no\r\nother trials could be had.[368]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the outcry did not in the least shake the faith of\r\nthe citizens who were insisting upon the crushing out of corruption at\r\nthe State's metropolis. Colonel Harris Weinstock, one of the largest\r\nmerchants of the State, in a ringing address condemned the efforts made\r\nto discredit the prosecution.[369] The same position was taken in\r\npulpit, club room and street discussion. From all parts of the State\r\nresolutions and memorials were sent the prosecution approving and\r\nupholding its work.[370] And doggedly the prosecution proceeded to\r\njustify the expressions of confidence in its singleness of purpose and\r\nin its ability to cope with the tremendous odds brought against it.\r\n\r\nThe immediate indictments about which the controversy raised by Ruef's\r\nclaim for immunity centered were those in the United Railroad cases. The\r\nprosecution accordingly went before the Grand Jury then sitting--the\r\nOliver Grand Jury which had brought the original indictments had long\r\nsince adjourned--and secured three indictments against Ruef, Calhoun and\r\nFord for the bribery of three Supervisors, Furey, Nicholas and Coleman.\r\n\r\nIn these indictments every technical error which the ingenuity of the\r\ndefense had brought out was eliminated. The new indictments were not\r\nsecured because the prosecution regarded the objections as having merit,\r\nbut that the District Attorney's office might be prepared to meet any\r\nemergency which might arise.[371]\r\n\r\nThe next step was to bring Ruef to trial. The prosecution selected the\r\nindictment under which Ruef had been brought to bar for offering a bribe\r\nto Supervisor Jennings Phillips to vote for the Parkside street railroad\r\nfranchise.[372]\r\n\r\nProspect of immediate trial made a different man of Ruef. He was at once\r\nseized with the panic which had come upon him when the jury had been\r\ncompleted to try him on the extortion charge. He begged for time. He\r\ninsisted that he was without counsel. He asked for three weeks, a week,\r\neven two days.[373]\r\n\r\nThen came an entirely new technical defense based upon the immunity\r\ncontract. Ruef alleged that he had been deprived of his constitutional\r\nrights as a defendant, by following the set program outlined in the\r\ncontract. But here Ruef had over-reached himself. He had on January 31\r\nentered a plea of not guilty in the Parkside case, the case on trial.\r\nThe District Attorney had abrogated the immunity contract thirteen days\r\nbefore, on January 18. Whatever technical advantage Ruef may have had\r\nbecause of the immunity contract was forfeited by his plea of not\r\nguilty after its annulment.\r\n\r\nHis attorney gravely contended, however, that Ruef--one of the shrewdest\r\npractitioners at the San Francisco bar--was without legal counsel when\r\nhe had entered his plea, and that he had therefore innocently foregone\r\nhis constitutional rights. This contention provoked a smile even from\r\nRuef's partisans. The point was not urged further.\r\n\r\nSeeing that trial could not be warded off on technicalities, Ruef\r\nendeavored to disqualify Judge Dunne, the trial judge. But this move\r\nproved premature. Judge Dunne was about to go on his vacation and Judge\r\nDooling,[374] a Superior Court Judge from the interior, was called to\r\nsit in Judge Dunne's stead. Ruef thereupon proceeded to disqualify Judge\r\nDooling. He alleged that Judge Dooling, as Grand President of the Native\r\nSons of the Golden West, had signed an order expelling him (Ruef) from\r\nthe order; he alleged further that Judge Dooling had attacked him in a\r\nspeech at a banquet.\r\n\r\nJudge Dooling, placed on trial as Judges Lawlor and Dunne had been, was\r\nforced to make defense. He denied in affidavits that he had ever\r\nspecially mentioned Ruef's name in any speech, but admitted that he\r\nmight have said that any man guilty of crime should be expelled from the\r\nNative Sons order.\r\n\r\nRuef went to the Appellate Court for a writ of prohibition to prevent\r\nJudge Dooling trying the case. The Appellate Court denied his petition.\r\nThen Ruef went to the Supreme Court. Here again his prayer was denied.\r\nThus, protesting as vigorously as a cat pulled over a carpet by the\r\ntail, was Ruef for a second time dragged to trial. The work of securing\r\na jury to try him began.\r\n\r\nGradually, the jury box filled. But before it was completed there\r\noccurred an incident of the prosecution even more startling than the\r\nsending of cash books out of the State, the trailing of members of the\r\nprosecution by agents of the defense,[375] the disappearance of\r\nwitnesses, the larceny of the prosecution's records, or the attempted\r\nkidnaping of Witness Lonergan and Editor Older.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of taking testimony in the Ruef case an attempt was made to\r\nmurder James L. Gallagher by dynamiting his residence. Gallagher was the\r\npivotal witness against Ruef, as well as against Ford, then on trial.\r\n\r\nIn the Ruef case, Gallagher had taken word from Ruef to the Supervisors\r\nthat there would be $750--later increased to $1000--for each of them if\r\nthey granted the Parkside franchise. Without Gallagher's testimony the\r\ncase against Ruef would fall flat.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ford's third trial was then in progress and well advanced. Here\r\nagain, Gallagher was the pivotal witness. He had taken the trolley bribe\r\nmoney from Ruef to the Supervisors. He supplied the link between those\r\nwho had been bribed, and Ruef. His testimony was indispensable if Ruef\r\nand Ford--then on trial--were to be convicted. His testimony was equally\r\nnecessary in the cases against Calhoun, Drum, in fact all the graft\r\ndefendants, except those who had dealt directly with the Supervisors.\r\n\r\nThe evening of the day following Gallagher's testimony in the Ford case,\r\nbut before he appeared at the Ruef trial, dynamite was exploded at the\r\nfront doors of the house in which he was residing. The dynamite had been\r\nplaced next to the dining room. Gallagher was at the time living at the\r\nhome of W. H. H. Schenck at Oakland.\r\n\r\nSo violent was the explosion that the house, a frame building, was split\r\nin twain. A pillar from the porch was thrown 150 feet. In the building\r\non the adjoining premises, every window was broken. The family had just\r\ncompleted the evening meal and a number of them were still seated around\r\nthe table. The table was split from end to end. At the moment of the\r\nexplosion, one of those in the house was showing a curious watch guard\r\nand had the watch in his hand. The watch stopped, thus fixing the exact\r\ntime of the explosion, 7:30 P. M.\r\n\r\nThere were in the house at the time of the explosion, W. H. H. Schenck\r\nand wife, and three children, the youngest seven years old; Lieutenant\r\nGuy Brown of the National Guard; and Gallagher and his wife. Every one\r\nin the building was thrown down by the force of the explosion, but\r\nextraordinary to say, none of them was seriously injured. Gallagher and\r\nhis wife were in an upper room of the building. The stairway was\r\ndemolished, and Gallagher was obliged to lower his wife to the ground,\r\ngetting down himself the best way he could.\r\n\r\nA month later three buildings in Oakland belonging to Gallagher were\r\ndestroyed by dynamite. Soon after this second explosion a young Greek,\r\nJohn Claudianes, was arrested and charged with the outrage.\r\n\r\nClaudianes made full confession, involving his brother Peter as\r\nprincipal. Peter Claudianes was finally captured at Chicago. On his\r\nreturn to San Francisco he confessed,[376] stating that he had been\r\nemployed by a Greek, one Felix Pauduveris,[377] to murder Gallagher.\r\nFelix Pauduveris fled the city and the police of the world have been\r\nunable to locate him. Peter Claudianes was convicted of the attempt upon\r\nGallagher's life, was sentenced to prison for life, and at present\r\nwriting is confined in San Quentin prison.[378]\r\n\r\nQuite as extraordinary as the attempted assassination of Gallagher was\r\nthe indifference with which the outrage was received by the press that\r\nwas supporting the graft defense.[379] The Chronicle condemned the\r\noutrage, but took occasion to denounce Gallagher.[380] The weekly\r\npress, however, treated the affair as something of a joke on the\r\nconfessed bribe-taker.[381]\r\n\r\nIn the face of the ridicule of the graft-defense press, the dynamiting\r\nof witnesses, and the continent-wide hunt for the dynamiters, the Ruef\r\ntrial went steadily on.\r\n\r\nOne incident of the beginning of the trial, because of the event that\r\ngrew out of it, eventually proved even more important than the trial\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nDuring the examination of jurors, an ex-convict, one Morris Haas, was\r\ndiscovered to have been sworn to try the case. Heney exposed him and he\r\nwas excused from service.[382] The incident, compared with the other\r\ntremendous happenings of the time, was of small importance, but it was\r\ndestined to lead to the greatest outrage of all the history of the\r\nprosecution, the shooting down of Assistant District Attorney Heney in\r\nopen court. But for the time, Haas passed out of the graft cases and was\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nThe Ruef trial was not unlike the Ford trials. The courtroom was packed\r\nwith detectives, agents and thugs employed by the various graft\r\ndefendants.[383] There was the same hesitancy on the part of witnesses.\r\nAt one stage of the proceedings Ach, Ruef's chief of counsel, sneered\r\nthat the State was having trouble with its own witness.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Heney, \"The People have no witness--no volunteer\r\nwitnesses. We merely produce them.\"\r\n\r\nWhen J. E. Green, president of the Parkside Company, who had authorized\r\nthe payments to Ruef, refused to testify on the ground that he might\r\nincriminate himself, it looked as though the case was going against the\r\nprosecution. But Heney met this objection. He promptly moved the\r\ndismissal of the fourteen indictments pending against Green.[384] Ach\r\nobjected, but the motion was granted. Green was left free to testify.\r\n\r\nGreen testified how he had sent his attorney,[385] Judge Walter C. Cope,\r\nto Ruef to find out what Ruef was after. Ruef wanted $50,000 to put the\r\nfranchise through. Green testified that Ruef finally agreed to take\r\n$30,000, and was actually paid $15,000 on account.\r\n\r\nG. H. Umbsen testified to having received $30,000 from the Parkside\r\nCompany for Ruef and had paid Ruef $15,000, the balance being held until\r\nthe deal should be consummated. In addition to this, the sorry\r\nmanner[386] in which the company's books had been juggled to cover up\r\nthe transaction was shown by witnesses connected with the Parkside\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nRuef's intimation through his attorney that the money had been paid as a\r\nfee was offset by testimony that the books had been juggled to cover up\r\nthe payment to Ruef because Ruef was the political boss of the city, and\r\nit was believed that it would do the company no good if the fact of his\r\nemployment were known.\r\n\r\nGallagher testified that he had been Ruef's representative on the board;\r\nthat Ruef had told him that the Parkside franchise was to be held up and\r\ndelayed; that later Ruef had stated that each Supervisor would receive\r\n$750 because of the Parkside deal; that finally, after the fire, Ruef\r\nhad told witness that the Parkside people wanted the franchise in a new\r\nform, and that the $750 to each Supervisor would be increased to $1,000;\r\nthat he (Gallagher) had conveyed this information to the Supervisors.\r\nSupervisors testified to having been given the information by\r\nGallagher.\r\n\r\nRuef offered no testimony. The jury was out forty-three hours. By a vote\r\nof 6 to 6 the jury failed to agree. Again a graft trial had ended in\r\ndiscouraging failure for the prosecution.[387]\r\n\r\nAfter the disagreement of the jury in the Ruef Parkside case, to judge\r\nfrom most of the San Francisco public prints of the time, the\r\nprosecution was utterly discredited in San Francisco. But there is a\r\nsurer means of estimating public opinion--namely, by the votes of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nMuch of the graft defense's abuse and vilification was heaped upon\r\nJudges Lawlor and Dunne, who had stood firmly for enforcement of the law\r\nregardless of who might be affected. Judge Dunne's term as Superior\r\nJudge was to expire in 1909. He was, at the November election of 1908, a\r\ncandidate for re-election.\r\n\r\nJudge Dunne was frankly fought by the graft defense, and supported by\r\nthose who approved the work of the prosecution. The Republican county\r\nconvention refused to nominate him, and hissed his name. The Union Labor\r\nparty convention received his name with a turmoil of hoots and jeers. A\r\nletter to the last-named convention from the Good Government League\r\nurging his nomination was thrown into the waste-paper basket.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when given opportunity for expression The People gave\r\nJudge Dunne encouraging endorsement. The Good Government League\r\nproceeded to have his name put on the ballot by petition. For the\r\npetition 1,765 signatures were required. Over 3,000 persons signed it\r\nthe first day. The press--outside San Francisco--following the graft\r\ntrials closely, was practically a unit in urging Judge Dunne's return to\r\nthe bench.[388] And in spite of the costly contest of his election, The\r\nPeople of San Francisco re-elected Judge Dunne.\r\n\r\nThus again were the contentions of the graft defense repudiated at the\r\npolls.\r\n\r\nAnother important endorsement of the prosecution came from the Board of\r\nSupervisors. The Supervisors provided in their annual budget $70,000 to\r\nmeet the extraordinary expenditures because of the graft cases. Burns\r\nand the men who had theretofore been paid out of the fund controlled by\r\nRudolph Spreckels, became regular municipal employees operating under\r\nthe District Attorney.\r\n\r\nThe criticism of the defense had been that it was shameful that a\r\nprivately-financed prosecution should be tolerated. Their cry now was at\r\nthe shame of wasting the public funds on Burns and his staff. Action was\r\ninstituted, through William H. Metson, to prevent the municipal\r\nofficials paying Burns and his associates out of this fund. For months\r\nthe salaries of those affected were held up. Although eventually the\r\nopposition to the prosecution lost in the contest, and the men were paid\r\nthe amounts due them, the suit was an annoyance and a handicap.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the tremendous opposition which the graft defense was\r\nworking up, the prosecution went steadily on with its work. Ruef was put\r\nto trial for offering a bribe to Supervisor Furey to vote for the permit\r\ngiving the United Railroads its overhead trolley franchise.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [356] When Calhoun returned to San Francisco demanding immediate\r\n       trial, the Examiner announced that he \"threw a bombshell into\r\n       the camp of the prosecution.\" The Call, however, dealt with\r\n       the incident as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Patrick Calhoun has come back in a hurry, shouting for an\r\n       immediate trial. He is certain that he has the prosecution on\r\n       the hip. His men are in treaty with Ruef. His organs in the\r\n       press, the Examiner, the Chronicle and the gutter weeklies,\r\n       begin to see Ruef in a wholly new light. Three weeks ago Ruef\r\n       was the vilest criminal. No immunity for him. Indeed,\r\n       immunity, in the lexicon of the Calhoun press, was then a\r\n       worse crime than bribery or graft. It is very different now\r\n       that the new alliance between Ruef and the bribe givers is in\r\n       process of negotiation. Ruef has at once become the persecuted\r\n       sufferer, the victim of a heartless cabal, pushing one more\r\n       unfortunate to his ruin and positively 'rushing' him to trial\r\n       with indecent haste, with no lawyers but Henry Ach to hire. It\r\n       is too bad.\r\n\r\n       \"Why this astonishing and sudden change of front? It is simply\r\n       that Calhoun has made up his mind that this is the time for\r\n       grafters and boodlers and bribe givers to stand together. He\r\n       has persuaded himself that the prosecution is dazed by the\r\n       extraordinary decision of the Court of Appeals, and that the\r\n       same has put Ruef in a receptive mood for a treaty of alliance,\r\n       offensive and defensive, among all varieties of boodlers,\r\n       franchise grabbers, bribe givers and bribe takers. Calhoun\r\n       knows that Ruef on trial or before trial is a very different\r\n       person from Ruef after conviction. He wants to keep Ruef in his\r\n       present state of mind. Of course, he knows that he can not\r\n       trust Ruef. No man who has had dealings with the shifty boss\r\n       knows on what side he will turn up next. At present Ruef lends\r\n       a responsive ear to Calhoun's overtures. Consultations are held\r\n       without disguise between Calhoun's lawyers and Ruef. It is time\r\n       for Ruef and Calhoun to stand together. The association is\r\n       suggestive but natural.\"\r\n\r\n [357] The graft prisoners unquestionably suffered greatly from their\r\n       confinement.\r\n\r\n       \"No matter,\" said Ruef, in an interview printed in The\r\n       Examiner January 11, 1908, \"how much effort is made, the place\r\n       cannot be kept clean. Filth accumulates and no running water\r\n       has been provided. The gases from the drain pipes permeate the\r\n       cells and are always present. No prisoner can keep himself\r\n       clean, and it is no wonder that clothing and everything is\r\n       uncleanly.\"\r\n\r\n       Schmitz, long of body, complained that he needed a long cell.\r\n       \"I would like a longer cell,\" he is reported as saying. \"My\r\n       legs are too long and I cannot stretch them out. The hole is\r\n       beastly and no place for a clean man.\"\r\n\r\n       Louis Glass declared that he would be dead in a few days if not\r\n       permitted to remain outside his cell.\r\n\r\n [358] See affidavit filed by District Attorney Langdon in The People\r\n       vs. Patrick Calhoun et al., No. 823.\r\n\r\n [359] See affidavits filed by District Attorney Langdon, and by\r\n       Judge Dunne, in the case of Patrick Calhoun et al., No. 823.\r\n\r\n [360] Langdon does not state in his affidavit what this evidence\r\n       was. But at the trial of Ruef for offering bribes to Jennings\r\n       Phillips to grant the Parkside Railroad franchise, former\r\n       Supervisor Wilson testified that at the first Ford trial Ruef\r\n       had asked him to bury his memory of the money transactions and\r\n       discussions with Ruef. Ruef at the time was pretending to be\r\n       assisting the Prosecution in conformity with the terms of his\r\n       immunity contract.\r\n\r\n [361] District Attorney Langdon, in an affidavit filed in the case\r\n       of The People vs. Patrick Calhoun et al., No. 823, states his\r\n       attitude toward Ruef. Mr. Langdon says:\r\n\r\n       \"Affiant further avers and declares that if affiant believed\r\n       that the defendant Ruef had fully and fairly performed his\r\n       part of the agreement, and had honestly rendered such service\r\n       to the State as would have entitled him to the consideration\r\n       set forth in the immunity contract, this affiant would have\r\n       moved in open court to dismiss the indictments against\r\n       defendant Ruef, and if said motion were denied and affiant was\r\n       directed by the Court or any other official to proceed with\r\n       the trial of said defendant, this affiant would have declined\r\n       to do so, and after exhausting every resource at his command\r\n       to carry out the terms and conditions of said immunity\r\n       agreement, would have resigned his official position of\r\n       District Attorney of the City and County of San Francisco,\r\n       rather than prosecute the defendant Ruef.\r\n\r\n       \"This affiant avers that it was only when he became convinced\r\n       that the defendant Ruef was still traitorous to the State he\r\n       had debauched, and whose laws he had defied, and that instead\r\n       of trying to make reparation for the wrong he had done, was\r\n       endeavoring not only to save himself from the punishment he so\r\n       richly deserved, but also was endeavoring to make certain the\r\n       escape from punishment of his co-defendants, that affiant\r\n       determined the immunity contract to have been broken by Ruef,\r\n       and no longer in force and effect.\"\r\n\r\n [362] The Examiner in its issue of January 19, 1908, stated that the\r\n       abrogation of the immunity contract, \"means among other things\r\n       that Ruef will now have aligned in his defense, the massed\r\n       influence of interests represented by the prosecution to\r\n       command $600,000,000 in wealth.\"\r\n\r\n [363] Heney, in an affidavit filed in the case of The People vs.\r\n       Patrick Calhoun et al., No. 823, states that he finally said\r\n       to Kaplan, \"You only annoy and irritate me by coming here,\r\n       Doctor, and I wish you would stay away. I don't want to get\r\n       mad at you, because I respect you and am satisfied that you\r\n       are sincere, but Ruef is making a fool of you, and I have\r\n       wasted more time than I can spare in talking with you about\r\n       these things. You will do me a great favor if you will stay\r\n       away from my office.\"\r\n\r\n       In spite of this suggestion, Kaplan, a few days later, called\r\n       Heney up on the telephone. Of the incident, Heney says in his\r\n       affidavit: \"A few days later, however, he called me on the\r\n       telephone. I was at my office at the time, and do not know\r\n       where he was. He said over the telephone in substance, 'Mr.\r\n       Heney, I don't like to trouble you any more, but I had a talk\r\n       with Mr. Burns and I have since had another talk with Mr.\r\n       Ruef, and I am sure that Mr. Ruef's testimony will now satisfy\r\n       you. He says that when he is on the witness stand and you ask\r\n       him'--I interrupted him at about this point and said in a very\r\n       severe tone of voice, 'Dr. Kaplan, I don't want you talking\r\n       such stuff to me over the phone, or anywhere else. I have\r\n       asked you not to talk to me about this matter any more and not\r\n       to come to my office, and I will now have to ask you not to\r\n       call me any more on the telephone. I don't want to hear\r\n       anything more about Ruef's testimony.'\"\r\n\r\n [364] See affidavits filed by Rabbis Nieto and Kaplan in the case of\r\n       The People vs. Patrick Calhoun et al.\r\n\r\n [365] See Chapter XV.\r\n\r\n [366] See Chapter XV.\r\n\r\n [367] A letter from W. H. Payson, a leader of the San Francisco bar,\r\n       to Rabbi Nieto fairly expressed the public attitude on the\r\n       Rabbi's stand. Mr. Payson's letter read: \"Rabbi Jacob Nieto.\r\n       Dear Sir:--As you have written a letter to the public\r\n       explaining your connection with the Ruef case, it may not be\r\n       out of place for one of the public to reply.\r\n\r\n       \"When Mr. Ruef made his apparently frank statement admitting\r\n       that he had betrayed his city into the hands of the spoilers,\r\n       but promised to do all in his power to right the wrong,\r\n       whatever the consequences might be to himself, the public\r\n       believed him and believed that he was going to do right\r\n       because it was right and for his own self-respect, and not at\r\n       the price of saving his own skin. Acting on this assumption\r\n       many of us congratulated Mr. Ruef and assured him that he had\r\n       gone far toward recovering his position in the public esteem.\r\n       It now turns out from your letter of explanation that Mr.\r\n       Ruef's public statement of his high and noble purpose was a\r\n       mockery and hollow sham; that he had rejected any proposition\r\n       to act the man, but like his contemptible associates, sought\r\n       only to escape his just deserts.\r\n\r\n       \"We recognize the unfortunate necessity the prosecution was\r\n       under of granting immunity in order to secure the evidence to\r\n       convict the greater felons, but surely the officers of the law\r\n       were fully qualified to attend to that miserable business. If\r\n       you could have influenced Mr. Ruef to stand on the higher plane\r\n       of honor and decency of which you are the advocate and\r\n       representative, you would indeed have done a great public\r\n       service and you might have saved him for better things, but it\r\n       would seem that your services were directed chiefly to saving\r\n       him from the just penalty of his crimes and that the\r\n       arrangement with him was on the same sordid level as the\r\n       immunity contracts with the Supervisors, for which no\r\n       ministerial services were necessary. From your position and\r\n       religious heritage we had a right to expect that your\r\n       distinguished services would have been put to a better use. I\r\n       am still sufficiently credulous as to believe that with proper\r\n       influence Mr. Ruef might have been induced to take the course\r\n       we were led to believe he had taken.\r\n\r\n       \"Your letter even leaves it to be inferred that Mr. Ruef is\r\n       justified in his present attitude, and that the judges, who,\r\n       from your statement, were ready to go to the extreme of mercy\r\n       and consideration, are now to be censured for not carrying out\r\n       an immunity contract which has been flagrantly broken by the\r\n       other party to it.\r\n\r\n       \"The serious features of this unfortunate situation are not\r\n       that officials should receive bribes, or that men of wealth and\r\n       standing should bribe them, or that attorneys of reputation\r\n       should engineer the filthy operation, but that not one of the\r\n       army of bribed and bribers has been found of sufficient\r\n       manliness or moral stamina to make a frank statement of the\r\n       facts and give aid in the cause of justice, and that so many\r\n       people are willing to shield the influential criminals for\r\n       commercial motives, and that there is so low a state of public\r\n       morals as to make these things possible.\r\n\r\n       \"The great body of the public is heart and soul back of this\r\n       prosecution, because we believe it is an honest attempt, not\r\n       merely to convict certain criminals, but to elevate the\r\n       standard of public morality, and whatever may be the outcome\r\n       and even though, through successive miscarriages of justice,\r\n       every guilty man escape his legal punishment, the graft\r\n       prosecution has, nevertheless, succeeded beyond our fondest\r\n       hopes; nine-tenths of its work has been accomplished, and in\r\n       the teeth of the most determined and desperate opposition\r\n       perhaps ever known.\r\n\r\n       \"Be assured that every guilty man will be convicted at the bar\r\n       of public opinion, and from that conviction there will be no\r\n       appeal and no escape; they will be known and branded for life,\r\n       each and every one. The public is not a party to the immunity\r\n       contracts.\r\n\r\n          \"Very truly yours,\r\n                                                    \"W. H. PAYSON.\r\n       \"San Francisco, January 30, 1908.\"\r\n\r\n [368] District Attorney Langdon's statement in reply to these\r\n       criticisms was as follows: \"I have no answer at this time to\r\n       make to the statements given out by Patrick Calhoun and made\r\n       in behalf of other defendants in the graft cases with the\r\n       intention of discrediting the prosecution and attempting to\r\n       lead the public to believe that we have acted unfairly in the\r\n       conduct of these cases. The time will come when such charges\r\n       will be answered, but they will be answered only as events\r\n       shall direct.\r\n\r\n       \"Nothing that has occurred within the past few weeks has in\r\n       any way complicated the situation as far as the prosecution is\r\n       concerned or has tended to weaken our position. The original\r\n       plans of the prosecution are to be carried out just as we have\r\n       always intended to carry them out. The Ruef case will be tried\r\n       immediately, and every other defendant under indictment will\r\n       be brought to trial just as quickly as the courts are able to\r\n       dispose of the cases. We shall not falter in our duty. I can\r\n       promise that while the present District Attorney is in office\r\n       this battle will be fought out to the end of the last case.\r\n\r\n       \"The fact is that at the present time we have the tactical\r\n       advantage over all the defendants, who have allied their\r\n       interests for mutual protection. They know we have this\r\n       advantage and that is why they are shouting so loudly from the\r\n       housetops. We do not answer the attacks that are made because\r\n       we are trying law cases and our every energy is bent to the\r\n       prosecution of those cases. We are entirely satisfied, however,\r\n       with the position in which we stand at this time and are\r\n       prepared to fight our battles in the courts to a finish.\"\r\n\r\n [369] The following are extracts taken from Mr. Weinstock's address:\r\n\r\n       \"After all, the saddest thing is to find men who are rated as\r\n       decent, law-abiding, intelligent, presumably high minded and\r\n       moral, condoning the sins of the bribe givers and deploring\r\n       their indictment and prosecution.\r\n\r\n       \"Both the commercial and political bribe givers committed\r\n       serious crimes, but by far the more serious was the crime of\r\n       corrupting public officials, because the tendency of this crime\r\n       is to undermine the very foundation of the State, thus leading\r\n       to the ultimate destruction of democracy.\r\n\r\n       \"If the spirit of the respectables, fighting and condemning the\r\n       graft prosecution, is to become the common spirit, then must we\r\n       bid farewell to civic virtue, farewell to public morality,\r\n       farewell to good government and in time farewell to our\r\n       republican institutions and to civic liberty.\"\r\n\r\n [370] A very good example of this is shown in a memorial from\r\n       Sonoma. The memorial read as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Sonoma, Cal., March 18, 1908. To William H. Langdon, Francis\r\n       J. Heney, Rudolph Spreckels and others engaged in the graft\r\n       prosecution in San Francisco. Gentlemen: It appearing that a\r\n       portion of the press of this State is engaged in belittling\r\n       the efforts of those engaged in the prosecution of the graft\r\n       cases in San Francisco, and is endeavoring to impute improper\r\n       and unjust motives to all who have such prosecution in charge;\r\n       and we realizing that it is the duty of all honest people\r\n       everywhere to uphold the hands of the prosecution, and to\r\n       encourage them to proceed in all lawful ways to continue in\r\n       their efforts to bring all law breakers to justice,\r\n\r\n       \"We, the undersigned citizens and residents of Sonoma and\r\n       vicinity, mindful of the good work you are all doing, wish to\r\n       show our appreciation of your efforts, and encourage you in\r\n       continuing to pursue the course you have marked out, to the end\r\n       that all law breakers shall be punished and the majesty of the\r\n       law vindicated.\"\r\n\r\n [371] Heney, in a published statement regarding these indictments,\r\n       said: \"We do not consider for a minute that there is a\r\n       particle of merit to any of the claims made by the defendants\r\n       that the former indictments were defectively drawn in any\r\n       detail. It is wise, however, to be prepared for anything that\r\n       might happen at any subsequent time, and so the present true\r\n       bills have been found. These indictments are so drawn as to\r\n       eliminate every technical objection that has been made by any\r\n       of the defendants to the former indictments, and the action\r\n       has been at this time so that the statute of limitations would\r\n       not run against the crime charged. There is absolutely no\r\n       significance to the fact that the name of Abbott and Mullally\r\n       were omitted, except that we feel that the cases against the\r\n       three defendants named are of far greater importance. Our sole\r\n       purpose has been to throw an anchor to windward to avoid\r\n       possible trouble in the future.\"\r\n\r\n [372] James D. Phelan, at the mass meeting called after the\r\n       attempted assassination of Heney, summed up the Parkside case\r\n       tersely: \"Take the Parkside case,\" he said. \"There were some\r\n       men who wanted a franchise which we were all willing to\r\n       concede, but the boss said it would be advisable to pay for\r\n       it. Instead of making a demand upon the Supervisors and an\r\n       appeal to the citizens on the justice of their cause and the\r\n       desirability of giving them the franchise, they continued\r\n       their dickering with Ruef, and for so much money, thirty\r\n       thousand dollars, I believe, he said he would give it to them.\r\n       Then they 'doctored' their books and went down to the Crocker\r\n       National Bank and got the money in green-backs, handed out to\r\n       them by the teller of that institution, whose managers were\r\n       stockholders in the Parkside, among them a gentleman who told\r\n       you the other day to vote against the Hetch-Hetchy\r\n       proposition, Mr. William H. Crocker.\r\n\r\n       \"Now, finding that they could get so easily a privilege by\r\n       paying for it, what did they do? They asked Mr. Ruef to give\r\n       them the franchise, not on Twentieth avenue, an ungraded\r\n       street, which they first wanted, but in Nineteenth avenue,\r\n       which had been dedicated as a boulevard for the use of the\r\n       people, which was substantially paved, and which was the only\r\n       avenue we had to cross from the park to Ingleside. He said to\r\n       them that that would take fifteen thousand dollars more, and\r\n       they said 'It's a bargain.' And these gentlemen who sought the\r\n       least objectionable franchise, tell you now that they were\r\n       victims, tell you now that they could not get their franchise\r\n       any other way. They were glad because they were a part of the\r\n       system, a part of the 'other fellows' of the affiliated\r\n       interests. They were glad to pay their money, which was a\r\n       paltry sum to them, in order to perpetuate the rule of Ruef;\r\n       that they could go to him on any other occasion to get an\r\n       extension, or a privilege or a franchise, or anything that\r\n       they wanted, by simply paying for it. It would be the simplest\r\n       form of government, my friends, to have somebody sitting in a\r\n       place of power and pass out to you what you want. It would\r\n       save you the expense of a campaign, it would save you the\r\n       advertising in the newspapers, it would save you the cost of\r\n       mailing a circular to every voter. It is indeed, a most\r\n       economical and direct method of getting what you want from the\r\n       government.\"\r\n\r\n [373] The Oakland Tribune, in support of Ruef's plea for delay,\r\n       said: \"Now the question arises: Is Ruef now being prosecuted\r\n       in good faith for the offenses alleged against him or is he\r\n       being forced to trial without adequate preparation merely to\r\n       coerce him into giving testimony he has repeatedly told Heney,\r\n       Langdon and Burns would be false? Is not the summary process\r\n       of law being invoked to compel Ruef to tell to a trial jury a\r\n       different story from the one he related under oath to the\r\n       Oliver Grand Jury? In other words, is not the prosecution now\r\n       trying either to punish Ruef for refusing to commit or convict\r\n       himself of perjury or intimidate him into assisting, as a\r\n       witness under duress, Heney and Langdon to make good the\r\n       threat they reiterated on the stump last fall that they would\r\n       send Patrick Calhoun to State prison?\r\n\r\n       \"Admitting Ruef to be guilty of all the crimes of which he\r\n       stands accused, is he not now being proceeded against in a\r\n       criminal spirit and with a criminal intent? Having failed to\r\n       get what they want by compounding the felonies of Ruef and his\r\n       followers, are not the prosecution resorting to compulsion\r\n       under the forms of law to compel the commission of perjury?\"\r\n\r\n [374] Judge M. T. Dooling was at the time Superior Judge of San\r\n       Benito, one of the smaller of the interior counties. He had,\r\n       however, already a State-wide reputation for integrity and\r\n       ability. He left the San Benito County bench to accept the\r\n       appointment of President Wilson as United States District\r\n       Judge.\r\n\r\n [375] Some of these trailers were arrested and forced into court. On\r\n       one day four men, Frank Shaw, alias Harry Nelson, Harry Smith,\r\n       alias Harry Zobler, J. R. Johnson, alias J. R. Hayes, and\r\n       Cliff Middlemiss were placed under arrest for following\r\n       Detective Burns.\r\n\r\n [376] According to Peter Claudianes' confession to Burns, he had\r\n       been summoned from Chico to San Francisco by Felix Pauduveris\r\n       early in March. Pauduveris told him he had a hard piece of\r\n       work for Claudianes to do, namely, kill Gallagher, the chief\r\n       witness in the graft prosecution. Pauduveris had told him\r\n       there was $1000 apiece and three dollars a day for expenses in\r\n       the job for them. The first proposition, according to\r\n       Claudianes' confession, was for Claudianes to shoot poisoned\r\n       glass into Gallagher's face by means of an ordinary\r\n       sling-shot. But this plan was abandoned on the ground that\r\n       Claudianes' capture would be sure to follow. A plan to poison\r\n       Gallagher was also abandoned. Destruction by means of dynamite\r\n       was finally decided upon. Pauduveris had taken Claudianes over\r\n       to Oakland and showed him where Gallagher resided. After the\r\n       failure of the dynamite plot, Claudianes had arranged to\r\n       secure apartments in the same building with Gallagher and put\r\n       poison into Gallagher's milk. Before this plot could be\r\n       carried out, John Claudianes had confessed and Peter had\r\n       become a fugitive from justice.\r\n\r\n       In his confession to Burns, Peter Claudianes stated:\r\n       \"Pauduveris said the prosecution with Heney, Langdon, Burns\r\n       and Spreckels had put about 50,000 men out of work. We must\r\n       get rid of Gallagher as he is their principal witness. If he\r\n       is put out of the way the Prosecution will end. There is about\r\n       $2000 in it for us and about $1000 in it for your brother\r\n       John. Felix Pauduveris was very angry because no one was\r\n       killed in the explosion at the Schenck house. He said it was\r\n       not a clean job.\"\r\n\r\n       In his confession, Claudianes stated further:\r\n\r\n       \"I thought I was working for Ruef, as I knew Felix was a very\r\n       intimate friend of his. When Felix told me I had got to shadow\r\n       Gallagher I knew the word came from Ruef. Felix said that Ruef\r\n       would never go across the bay, as he had them all buffaloed.\r\n       Ruef was too smart for those fellows, Felix said, and the gang\r\n       was all behind Ruef. The prosecution had no grudge against\r\n       Gallagher, but it had a grudge against Ruef.\"\r\n\r\n [377] Pauduveris had been employed by the United Railroads as a\r\n       \"spotter.\" At the time of the explosion he was still in that\r\n       corporation's employ. He was at the same time a political\r\n       follower of Ruef.\r\n\r\n [378] The attempt upon Gallagher's life led the prosecution to take\r\n       steps to secure his testimony in a form in which it could be\r\n       used before a trial jury in the event of Gallagher's death.\r\n       Under the California law, testimony taken at a preliminary\r\n       hearing can, in the event of the death or disability of a\r\n       witness, be used at the trial of the case. After the Parkside\r\n       case trial, Ruef was arrested on a charge of bribery and given\r\n       a preliminary examination at which Gallagher testified against\r\n       him. Gallagher's testimony was thus made secure against poison\r\n       or dynamite.\r\n\r\n [379] The Examiner following the explosion printed a series of\r\n       ridiculing cartoons picturing the dynamiting of a bird cage\r\n       and describing at length the escape of the parrot that had\r\n       occupied it.\r\n\r\n [380] The Chronicle took advantage of the dynamite outrage to voice\r\n       its condemnation of Gallagher. \"There is,\" said that paper in\r\n       its issue of April 24, \"no more undesirable citizen on earth\r\n       than the contemptible boodler James L. Gallagher, who is\r\n       living on the profits of the shame which he brazenly flaunts\r\n       in the face of mankind, but the effort to discover the\r\n       miscreant who dynamited the house where he was living should\r\n       be pushed as vigorously as if the intended victim was the most\r\n       estimable citizen of California. Society despises such\r\n       boodlers as Gallagher, but it does not seek their destruction\r\n       by dynamite. The dynamiter is a coward who is even more\r\n       contemptible than a boodler. He sneaks up in the dark, fires\r\n       his explosive and runs, because in his craven soul he dare not\r\n       stand up and meet his enemy. The punishment of the\r\n       dynamiter--successful or unsuccessful--should be severe, but\r\n       it should be solemnly inflicted after due process of law.\r\n\r\n       \"It is, of course, possible that some of the wretches with\r\n       whom he was associated during his career of crime have taken\r\n       that method of getting rid of his testimony, but it is not\r\n       probable. Among those against whom he has not yet given the\r\n       testimony which he will give are the only persons who can be\r\n       conceived of as having a motive to get Gallagher out of the\r\n       way, but no one that we hear of suspects any of them of having\r\n       resorted to that atrocious method of defense, in which six\r\n       persons besides Gallagher himself came near being murdered. In\r\n       the absence of any conceivable sufficient motive the dastardly\r\n       act must be assumed the work of a wicked man gone crazy.\"\r\n\r\n [381] The following from the San Francisco Argonaut of May 2, 1908,\r\n       is fairly expressive of the attitude of the San Francisco\r\n       weekly press on the attempt on Gallagher's life: \"Mr. Heney in\r\n       so far as it lay in him to do it, 'placed' the 'crime' upon\r\n       the 'minions' of Calhoun. The other independent and all-seeing\r\n       minds of the prosecution's staff fell in with this theory of\r\n       the case. So far as the so-called graft prosecutors are\r\n       concerned there is no mystery about the matter--the explosion\r\n       in Gallagher's house was nothing less than an attempt to\r\n       assassinate that eminent worthy for the sake of 'getting him\r\n       out of the way.' This theory has to face several embarrassing\r\n       considerations. In the first place, Gallagher's testimony has\r\n       been given again and again, and stands as an official record\r\n       in a half-dozen instances. Getting Gallagher out of the way\r\n       would not, therefore, do away with his testimony. Furthermore,\r\n       there are other witnesses competent to testify to every vital\r\n       fact in the Gallagher story. So far as the immediate case is\r\n       concerned, Gallagher has already given his testimony and the\r\n       effect of 'getting him out of the way' would be only to\r\n       emphasize his statements. Furthermore, if there had been any\r\n       wish to get Gallagher out of the way there has been plenty of\r\n       chances to do it any time this year and a half past. If\r\n       assassination has been part of the scheme of the defense,\r\n       there have been ten thousand opportunities since the striking\r\n       of that famous bargain between Spreckels and Gallagher inside\r\n       the Presidio gate. The thing might have been done, too,\r\n       without hazarding the lives of half a dozen women and\r\n       children.\"\r\n\r\n       In view of the inability of Mr. Langdon's successor in the\r\n       District Attorney's office to make effective prosecution of\r\n       the graft cases, on the ground that Gallagher, who had left\r\n       California, was absent from the State, and that his testimony\r\n       was necessary to secure convictions, the Argonaut article\r\n       makes interesting reading.\r\n\r\n [382] Heney's exposure of Haas was unquestionably warranted and\r\n       necessary. The incident, however, has been made subject of\r\n       much misrepresentation and attacks upon Heney.\r\n\r\n [383] Heney in a speech made before Mayor and Supervisors showed how\r\n       the prosecution was harassed by thugs.\r\n\r\n [384] See transcript in The People vs. Ruef (Parkside case) for\r\n       dismissal of these indictments and of other indictments\r\n       against Parkside officials.\r\n\r\n [385] For additional data regarding this case, see Chapter XIV,\r\n       footnotes 180, 181, 198, 199, 200, 201.\r\n\r\n [386] See footnote 199.\r\n\r\n [387] Months after, when men had been indicted for endeavoring to\r\n       influence jurors to vote for Ruef's acquittal in the United\r\n       Railroads case, Isaac Penny, who had acted as foreman of the\r\n       jury that failed to agree in the Parkside case, in a public\r\n       statement denounced that jury as not honest. \"Had I known\r\n       then,\" said Penny in an interview printed in the San Francisco\r\n       Call, September 30, 1908, \"what I have since learned about\r\n       jury tampering, I would have sprung a sensation in Judge\r\n       Dooling's court that would have resulted in the haling of\r\n       numerous men before the court. * * * I have been turning this\r\n       over again and again in my mind, and there is but one\r\n       answer--that jury was not an honest one.\"\r\n\r\n       Later, Penny gave sensational testimony along this line in\r\n       Judge Lawlor's court.\r\n\r\n [388] From one end of the State to the other, Judge Dunne was warmly\r\n       commended as a jurist and a man. \"The name of Judge Dunne,\"\r\n       said the Pasadena News, \"stands in California honored among\r\n       honest men because of the enemies he has made. Every\r\n       politician and every newspaper that has defended bribery and\r\n       sought to embarrass the graft prosecution is against Judge\r\n       Dunne. They stocked a political convention against him. Judge\r\n       Dunne's defeat in San Francisco would be a disgrace to that\r\n       city and a reflection on the honor and intelligence of the\r\n       people of California.\"\r\n\r\n       \"The corrupt corporation organs,\" said the Sacramento Bee,\r\n       \"and the servile journalistic tools of the predatory\r\n       rich--such as the Argonaut, for instance--are barking in\r\n       unison at the heels of Judge Dunne in San Francisco and\r\n       declaring he is unfit to sit on the bench. Dunne's crime in\r\n       their eyes is that he did his simple, plain duty in the graft\r\n       prosecution cases. If he had neglected that duty, to tip the\r\n       scales of Justice over to favor the 'higher ups,' the same\r\n       gang, with the Argonaut in the lead, would be praising him to\r\n       the skies as a most just judge, a righteous judge, and would\r\n       be clamoring for his re-election.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n                          JURY-FIXING UNCOVERED.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the graft trials rumors of efforts to tamper with\r\nthe trial jurors had been current. The failures of juries to agree in\r\nthe face of what to the man on the street appeared to be conclusive\r\nevidence, lent more or less color to these reports. But it was not until\r\nRuef's trial[389] for offering a bribe in the over-head trolley\r\ntransaction opened, that the jury-fixing scandal took definite shape.\r\nThen, came sensational exposures, involving indictments and trials for\r\njury-fixing which for a time over-shadowed in interest the graft trials\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nRuef's trial for offering a bribe to Supervisor Furey to vote for the\r\nover-head trolley franchise, began August 27, 1908.[390] But nearly a\r\nmonth before, on July 31, District Attorney Langdon had been given\r\ndefinite information that an attempt had been made to bribe one of the\r\ntalesmen who had been called for jury service at the Ruef trial. The\r\ntalesman in question was John Martin Kelly, a real estate salesman.\r\n\r\nThe list of prospective jurors had been made public in July. Late on the\r\nafternoon of July 31, Mr. Langdon received a telephone message from\r\nKelly requesting an interview, which was granted immediately.\r\n\r\nKelly told Langdon[391] that that afternoon he had been approached by a\r\nbuilding contractor, E. A. S. Blake, and offered $500 if he would\r\nqualify on the Ruef jury and vote for acquittal.[392]\r\n\r\nLangdon called in Burns. Burns advised Kelly to pretend to listen to\r\nBlake's overtures, to insist that $500 was too little, and to demand\r\n$1000, to the end that Blake might be trapped and the jury-fixing, which\r\nall believed to be going on, be uncovered.\r\n\r\nKelly, co-operating with Burns, followed these instructions. In his\r\ndealings with Blake, Kelly insisted upon $1000 as the price of his\r\nservices in Ruef's behalf, which Blake finally consented should be paid\r\nhim. The negotiations were carried on during August. Finally on\r\nSeptember 3, Burns directed Kelly to step up to the bar of Judge\r\nLawlor's court where Ruef's trial was proceeding, and tell his story.\r\n\r\nAs Kelly on that day approached the bar, during a lull in the\r\nproceedings, Ach, it is alleged, was heard to ejaculate to the little\r\ngroup about Ruef, \"There she goes.\"\r\n\r\nFrank J. Murphy, one of Ruef's attorneys, immediately jumped to his\r\nfeet, and claimed the court's attention.\r\n\r\n\"If your honor please,\" said Murphy, \"if that completes the examination\r\nof this panel and it is necessary to draw further from the box, there is\r\na statement I desire to make to this Court which is based upon some\r\nreflection and upon the advice of the Presiding Judge of this court.\r\nSome several weeks ago, or about two weeks ago I should say, one of the\r\njurors upon this panel sent to me indirectly and offered to accept money\r\nfor his vote. Charges of bribery, of course, have been numerous in\r\nconnection with this case, but this is the first instance that I have\r\never heard of in connection with this case or in connection with any\r\nother case that any juror has solicited a bribe, or has been offered a\r\nbribe. I consulted with Judge Sturtevant[393] about the matter on the\r\n1st of September. I stated to him the facts in the case and he advised\r\nme that whenever the time became ripe for the juror to be called into\r\nthe box that it was my duty to present it to this court. Now, the\r\njuror's name is John Martin Kelly, and I was informed indirectly that\r\nMr. Kelly solicited $1000 for his vote in this case, and the matter is\r\nof so much importance, your Honor, that I think an investigation should\r\nbe had by this court before this case proceeds further, and if necessary\r\nthe Grand Jury should look into this matter and give it a thorough and\r\nexhaustive examination. Now, if your Honor please, I don't want to do\r\nMr. Kelly an injustice. I would hesitate, if the Court please, to make a\r\ncharge of that kind, but my informant is a man whom I have known but a\r\nvery short time, and after a thorough examination by me of him, after\r\neliciting from him every fact I could in connection with the case, I am\r\ninduced to believe that he came with authority from Mr. Kelly to make\r\nthis proposition to myself and one of the attorneys who was connected\r\nwith one of the other cases. Now, if the Court please, under the advice\r\nof Judge Sturtevant, whom I consulted on the subject twice, I deem it my\r\nduty to call that to the attention of your Honor and if it is necessary\r\nto file any affidavit to set the machinery of this court in motion I am\r\nwilling and ready to procure an affidavit to file so that a complete\r\ninvestigation may be had of this matter.\"\r\n\r\nMurphy's statement created a sensation, which was more than duplicated\r\nby the statement made by Heney the moment after.\r\n\r\n\"If the Court please,\" said Heney, \"before Mr. Murphy takes the stand I\r\nhave a statement to make. Mr. Murphy says that he discussed this subject\r\non the 1st. I have in my pocket a statement dictated by Mr. Kelly--this\r\nis one of the most audacious pieces of business I have yet met with--I\r\nhave a statement made by this juror on August 28, 1908, that is before\r\nMr. Murphy bethought him to go and see Judge Sturtevant, in which this\r\njuror sets forth fully the fact that a man was sent to him to bribe him\r\nin this case, and this juror not only made that statement on August\r\n28th, but this juror went to the District Attorney's office, to Mr.\r\nLangdon, the other day, on July 31st, the day it was made, it is a long\r\ntime now and he has been acting under the District Attorney's advice\r\never since, and Mr. Murphy never saw fit to call your Honor's attention\r\nto it until he saw Mr. Kelly come in the door there and anticipated from\r\nthe fact that Mr. Blake was traced to Mr. Ach's office yesterday that\r\nMr. Kelly was about to state to your Honor that he wanted this matter\r\ninvestigated, and that an attempt had been made to bribe him, and that\r\nunder the District Attorney's advice he was going on to permit them to\r\npay the money, if necessary, so that we might catch them in this act,\r\nand it is only because they have had occasion to suspect we knew it,\r\nthat Mr. Murphy has the audacity to come in here and ask for an\r\ninvestigation. Now, we ask that Mr. Kelly take the stand and make the\r\nstatement to your Honor that he came here for the purpose of making, and\r\nthat Mr. Murphy didn't say anything about until he saw him standing\r\nthere ready to make it to your Honor. He jumped up as soon as he saw Mr.\r\nKelly walk in here.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Heney had made his statement, Murphy took the stand and swore that\r\nKelly, through Blake, had solicited a bribe of $1000 from Murphy to vote\r\nfor Ruef's acquittal. Nevertheless, Mr. Murphy, as well as Mr. A. S.\r\nNewburgh, another of Ruef's attorneys, admitted under oath that they had\r\nsuggested to Blake that he interview Kelly.[394]\r\n\r\nKelly took the stand and testified in a straightforward manner that he\r\nhad been approached by Blake, that he had consulted with the District\r\nAttorney, and that a trap had been set to catch the alleged jury-fixer.\r\n\r\nDetectives were sent out to notify Blake that he was wanted in court.\r\nBut Blake could not be found. Later he was arrested as he was about to\r\nboard an outgoing train.\r\n\r\nBlake was found to be a poor man on the brink of bankruptcy. He had\r\nneither money, nor property. Nevertheless, attorneys[395] came forward\r\nto defend him; bonds were furnished him. The most powerful and wealthy\r\ndefendant in the graft cases was not better served. But the best of\r\nlegal service could not save Blake from indictment. Later, both Newburgh\r\nand Murphy,[396] Mr. Ruef's attorneys, were indicted also, charged with\r\ncorruptly attempting to influence a juror.[397]\r\n\r\nKelly, at Blake's trial, told the same straightforward story which he\r\nhad given at the original investigation. He was corroborated by his\r\nemployer, and others. His testimony was most sensational. He stated, for\r\nexample, that Blake had told him that it would be easy for him to\r\nqualify as a juror; that Ruef's attorneys would try to make it appear\r\nthat they did not want him, and that their examination would be so\r\nthorough that the prosecution would not ask a question. Blake had also\r\ntold him, Kelly testified, that he need not worry; that some jurors had\r\ntaken money for their votes in the former Ruef trial and had not been\r\ncaught.\r\n\r\nBlake was convicted. He was later sentenced to serve four years in the\r\npenitentiary. After Blake's conviction, but before sentence was passed\r\nupon him, he sought out Attorney Matt I. Sullivan, one of the few\r\nprominent San Francisco attorneys who had kept free from entangling\r\nalliances with the graft defense. To Sullivan, Blake made\r\nconfession[398] of his participation in the jury-fixing transaction. In\r\nhis confession he involved Attorneys Murphy and Newburgh. Later, in open\r\ncourt, he made public statement of his participation.[399]\r\n\r\nBlake in his statement in court set forth that he had become acquainted\r\nwith Newburgh through having offices in the same building with him. He\r\nhad, he said, met Murphy in Newburgh's office. Newburgh had introduced\r\nthem. Murphy, he stated, had shown him a list of prospective jurors, and\r\nhad asked him if he knew any of them. He had told the lawyers that he\r\nknew John Martin Kelly. They had, Blake stated, got him to make an offer\r\nto Kelly, which he did. He had offered Kelly $500 and finally $1000.\r\nKelly (acting under instructions from District Attorney Langdon and\r\nBurns) had finally agreed to take $1000. Blake testified that he had\r\nreported back to Murphy that Kelly would accept the money.\r\n\r\nFollowing his arrest, Blake testified, his lawyers had come to him\r\nwithout his solicitation,[400] with the statement in explanation that\r\nthey had come from a mutual friend. Blake stated that he had heard\r\nafterward that the \"mutual friend\" was Murphy and Newburgh. His bonds\r\nhad been furnished without his stir, through his attorneys. Murphy and\r\nNewburgh, he claimed, had assured him they would do everything they\r\ncould for him; that he need not worry; that they would provide for him\r\nand provide for his wife in case he were convicted.[401]\r\n\r\nContinuing, Blake stated that after his conviction he had had a talk\r\nwith Murphy. The general nature of the interview was that he had good\r\nground for a new trial. \"They said,\" Blake testified, \"'when we get up\r\nto the higher court, it will be thrown out,' or something of that kind.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Blake's statement, a fund of $10,000 was promised him and\r\nan agreement was made that his wife should be paid $100 a month during\r\nhis imprisonment. Murphy, he said, showed him what purported to be\r\npromissory notes[402] aggregating $7500. The notes, he alleged, were\r\nmade to Murphy and signed with Ruef's name with the endorsement of\r\nRuef's sister and father. Blake was requested to select a representative\r\nto hold the notes. It was alleged that Blake named Martin Stevens, an\r\nattorney, as such representative.[403]\r\n\r\nAfter Blake's confession came the trials of Murphy and Newburgh. They\r\ndid not differ to any great extent from the principal graft trials.\r\nThere were the delaying tactics that had been characteristic of the\r\ngraft cases; failure of jurors to agree; acquittals.\r\n\r\nMurphy's trial came first. There was against him the testimony of Blake\r\nand Kelly, corroborated at many points by other witnesses. Murphy made\r\ndenial. In his defense, too, many witnesses took the stand to testify to\r\nhis good character.[404] Murphy was acquitted.\r\n\r\nNewburgh's trial followed. The first jury failed to agree. It was stated\r\nat the time that the jury stood six for conviction and six for\r\nacquittal. At his second trial, Newburgh was acquitted.\r\n\r\nBut Blake was in jail under a four years' sentence to the penitentiary.\r\nAstonishing as the revelations in the Blake jury-fixing case had been,\r\nthey were to be overshadowed by the events of Ruef's trial. Even as the\r\ncity stood aghast at the evidence of jury tampering, Assistant District\r\nAttorney Heney was, during the progress of the trial, shot down in open\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [389] Of the \"fixing of juries,\" The Chronicle in its issue of\r\n       September 19, 1908, said: \"Every move made in the Ruef trials\r\n       gives moral evidence that systematic bribery of juries is\r\n       being practiced which is as convincing to the public as were\r\n       the signs of corruption during the entire Schmitz regime, but\r\n       before the explosion. Nobody doubted then that the Mayor, the\r\n       Supervisors and all officials appointed by Schmitz were\r\n       thieves. Nobody doubts now that all through these graft trials\r\n       there has been systematic corruption of juries. In private\r\n       conversation it is treated as a matter of course. Nobody, of\r\n       course, could 'prove' it. Nobody needs legal proof to be\r\n       convinced.\"\r\n\r\n       Of the incident, The Call said in its issue of September 19,\r\n       1908: \"For a long time there has been every reason to believe\r\n       that veniremen summoned to try Ruef were being bribed or\r\n       promised bribes to vote for acquittal. The dubious character\r\n       of Ruef's attorneys, or some of them, and their known\r\n       affiliations were wholly consistent with this theory.\r\n       Circumstances not amounting to absolute proof, but giving\r\n       cause for strong suspicion, came to the surface from time to\r\n       time. The jury fixers grew bolder with impunity, and, in fine,\r\n       the pitcher went to the well once too often.\"\r\n\r\n [390] The trial had been delayed by Ruef's preliminary hearing. The\r\n       hearing was held in order that Gallagher's testimony might\r\n       become of record in a way that would permit of its being used\r\n       at Ruef's trial, in the event of Gallagher's assassination.\r\n\r\n       Ruef's attorneys by lengthy cross-examinations and other\r\n       delaying tactics, succeeded in dragging the case along for\r\n       sixty-nine days. Further delays were caused by the usual\r\n       efforts made to disqualify Judge Lawlor as trial judge. In\r\n       this way, the defense managed to keep the attorneys for the\r\n       State engaged until late in August. Then Ruef was made to face\r\n       another jury.\r\n\r\n [391] Kelly claimed to have telephoned Langdon within a few minutes\r\n       after Blake had left him. In this he was borne out by his\r\n       employer, Samuel M. Snyder. Snyder testified that on his\r\n       return to his office on the afternoon of July 31, he met Blake\r\n       leaving. Kelly had followed him into his private office. Of\r\n       the interview which followed Snyder testified at the hearing\r\n       of the case as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"I said (to Kelly) 'Well, what is the matter now?' And he said\r\n       that Mr. Blake was just in and wanted to give him $500. I\r\n       said, 'What for?' 'Well,' he said, 'to do the right thing on\r\n       the jury.' He had been called on a jury case, the Ruef case.\r\n       He said, 'I had a notion to punch his head.' That is just the\r\n       remark Mr. Kelly used. I said, 'Oh, I would not get excited\r\n       like that; that is foolishness.' He said, 'What do you advise\r\n       doing? If I go out and do anything rash I am liable to get\r\n       into trouble, ain't I?' I said, 'Yes, you better not do that.'\r\n       I said, 'If I were you'--this is the language I used to Mr.\r\n       Kelly, I said, 'I would telephone to Mr. Langdon and tell\r\n       him.' He said, 'Well, that might hurt your business.' I said,\r\n       'Well, I don't believe that would hurt my business any. I\r\n       firmly believe that jurors should not be tampered with by\r\n       anyone to try any case, no matter what it is.' And from there\r\n       he did telephone to Mr. Langdon.\"\r\n\r\n       The Court: \"When was this, Mr. Snyder?\"\r\n\r\n       \"A. That was on the 31st of July, pretty close to 5 o'clock in\r\n       the afternoon.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Did Mr. Kelly call up a telephone number from the office at\r\n       that time?\r\n\r\n       \"A. He called up Mr. Langdon from the office at that time. I\r\n       was sitting right by the side of him.\"\r\n\r\n [392] Of Blake's negotiations Kelly testified: \"Mr. Blake began\r\n       about this way: He said, 'Now, John, I have got a proposition\r\n       to make to you, and I don't know how you will take it. If you\r\n       like it, all right, if you don't, just keep it quiet.' He\r\n       says, 'There is a chance for you to make a little money.' He\r\n       said, 'You are drawn to serve on the Ruef jury.' I was\r\n       surprised to hear that. I told him, 'I know I am on some panel\r\n       in Judge Lawlor's Court, but didn't know it was the Ruef\r\n       jury.' I said, 'How did you find out?' 'Oh,' he said--I think\r\n       he said a friend of his told him, or something like that; but\r\n       anyhow he said, 'Now, it is this way; there is $500 in it for\r\n       you if you will get on that jury and vote to acquit Mr. Ruef.'\r\n       I says, 'Well, Mr. Blake, I have never done anything like\r\n       that, and it is a pretty big chance to take. I don't want\r\n       anything like that'; and he began to urge it on me. I said,\r\n       'Now, give me a chance to think it over.'\"\r\n\r\n       Kelly testified that his first impulse was to denounce Blake.\r\n       But instantly he reflected that the denunciation would do no\r\n       good. Besides, he reflected, it was possible that Blake might\r\n       be trapped.\r\n\r\n       As soon as Blake left the office, Kelly told what had occurred\r\n       to his employer, Snyder, and within an hour was in consultation\r\n       with District Attorney Langdon and Burns.\r\n\r\n [393] Judge Sturtevant, at the investigation which followed, showed\r\n       himself not at all clear as to details. Finally Murphy asked\r\n       him:\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Judge, do you remember that I said to you that I had\r\n       information that one of the jurors was willing to sell his\r\n       vote for $1,000 and someone had come to me with that?\r\n\r\n       \"A. I remember, Mr. Murphy, you mentioned the amount of $1,000\r\n       regarding one of his statements, but I would not go further\r\n       than that; I don't remember what this man had agreed to do for\r\n       the thousand dollars. That is my general recollection that\r\n       that is about the substance of the statement you made to me.\"\r\n\r\n [394] Murphy's testimony on this point was as follows: \"On a day\r\n       between the 20th of July and the 1st day of August, I went to\r\n       the office of Mr. Newburgh. Mr. Newburgh was then engaged in\r\n       defending Mr. Ruef on a preliminary examination had in one of\r\n       the Parkside cases. We were discussing generally the Ruef\r\n       cases and the graft prosecution, and a man came into the\r\n       office who was introduced to me by Mr. Newburgh as E. A. S.\r\n       Blake. This present jury panel had been drawn, and we were\r\n       discussing the Ruef cases generally, and finally I made a\r\n       remark that the trial of Mr. Ruef in one of these\r\n       cases--referring to 1436, 1437 and 1438, would proceed as soon\r\n       as the Police Court examination was finished, and I stated\r\n       that a jury had been impaneled, or a jury had been drawn, I\r\n       had a list of the jury in my pocket, and I pulled it out and\r\n       said to both Mr. Newburgh and to Mr. Blake: 'Perhaps you might\r\n       know some of these people.' Mr. Blake glanced at the list, and\r\n       he came down to the name of Mr. Kelly, and he said, 'I know\r\n       Mr. Kelly; I have known him for a number of years; I used to\r\n       work at Shreve's jewelry store with him; and he is an intimate\r\n       acquaintance of mine.' Then I said, having in mind the\r\n       decision of your Honor in the contempt case of W. J. Burns and\r\n       others--\"\r\n\r\n       The Court: (interruption): \"Did this occur after that\r\n       decision?\"\r\n\r\n       \"A. Yes--no, your Honor--I don't know--no, no. But having in\r\n       mind--I will state what I had in mind--a statement your Honor\r\n       had made at some previous time, that either side had the right\r\n       to find out how the jury stood; that is, if they used\r\n       legitimate means. I said to Mr. Blake, I said, 'How do you\r\n       think Mr. Kelly stands on the graft prosecution?' 'Well,' he\r\n       said, 'Mr. Kelly is a very liberal-minded fellow and I think he\r\n       would give Ruef a square deal.' So I then said, 'Well, I would\r\n       like to find out whether any of Mr. Burns' gumshoe men have\r\n       interviewed him, or whether he belongs to the Good Government\r\n       League or the League of Justice or any kindred organizations.'\r\n       He said he would find out the next time he met Mr. Kelly.\"\r\n\r\n       See printed transcript on appeal The People vs. Abraham Ruef,\r\n       Part II, Vol. II, p. 878. For Newburgh's statement see same\r\n       transcript, part and volume, pages 943 and 944.\r\n\r\n [395] In this there was remarkable similarity to the legal\r\n       assistance given thugs who were from time to time arrested for\r\n       interfering with the work of the Prosecution.\r\n\r\n [396] Murphy had figured in the Ruef trials, somewhat sensationally,\r\n       from the beginning. When, for instance, Ruef, early in March,\r\n       1907, was a fugitive from justice, Murphy was acting as one of\r\n       his attorneys. He was placed on the stand in Judge Dunne's\r\n       court. The Chronicle, in its issue of March 7, 1907, contained\r\n       the following account of his testimony:\r\n\r\n       \"Frank J. Murphy, one of Ruef's lawyers, testified that he had\r\n       last seen Ruef just outside Hebbard's courtroom on Monday.\r\n\r\n       \"Have you been doing any business with him since?\"\r\n\r\n       \"Murphy declined to answer this under his privilege as an\r\n       attorney. 'We are looking for an absconding and hostile\r\n       defendant, and the witness should not be allowed to draw\r\n       conclusions as to whether the business he is doing for him is\r\n       privileged,' declared Hiram Johnson.\r\n\r\n       \"Heney suggested that it was the request to do this business\r\n       rather than the business itself, that was sought by the\r\n       Prosecution.\r\n\r\n       \"A compromise was effected on an answer by the witness that he\r\n       had not communicated directly or indirectly with Ruef during\r\n       the past forty-eight hours.\"\r\n\r\n [397] About the same time, Captain John J. West became involved in a\r\n       charge of being connected with an alleged attempt to corruptly\r\n       influence a talesman named John R. Foley to vote to acquit\r\n       Ruef. But the West case was so overshadowed in importance by\r\n       the Blake-Murphy-Newburgh proceedings that the public paid\r\n       comparatively little attention to it.\r\n\r\n [398] \"Confessing his crimes,\" said The Call in its issue of October\r\n       30, 1908, \"Blake, the jury briber, lays bare the ulcer that\r\n       eats away the vitals of popular government. He explains why\r\n       the San Francisco Graft Prosecution has not yet put anybody in\r\n       the penitentiary. He makes it clear why Ruef is not in\r\n       stripes. He shows why it is next to impossible to convict a\r\n       rich man. He answers the familiar question, 'What's the matter\r\n       with San Francisco?'\r\n\r\n       \"On his way to prison Blake pauses for a moment and gives the\r\n       people of San Francisco the most convincing argument in favor\r\n       of the Graft Prosecution that they have had since the boodled\r\n       Supervisors told their story of shame, and Ruef, in tears,\r\n       delivered his confession, since recanted. Blake's revelation\r\n       is of inestimable value to the cause of decency. Opportunely\r\n       he tears away curtain and scenery and lets the people see what\r\n       goes on behind the showy pretense of the graft defense. In the\r\n       nick of time he exposes some of the actors in that satirical\r\n       comedy which might very well be called 'To Hell with the\r\n       Law--Money is Above It.'\"\r\n\r\n [399] Members of the faculty of Stanford University sent the\r\n       following communication to Rudolph Spreckels, William H.\r\n       Langdon, Francis J. Heney, William J. Burns and their\r\n       associates:\r\n\r\n       \"We, the undersigned citizens of the State of California,\r\n       realizing the far reaching significance of the sworn\r\n       confession, as a jury briber, of E. A. S. Blake, extend to you\r\n       our earnest and sincere congratulations on having successfully\r\n       demonstrated the nature of some of the obstacles blocking the\r\n       way of the conviction of powerful criminals in our\r\n       commonwealth.\r\n\r\n       \"Believing that no stability of social relations, including\r\n       normal business conditions, can be established on a less firm\r\n       basis than incorruptible courts and honest juries, leading to\r\n       the prompt and sure administration of justice, we wish to\r\n       assure you of our continued confidence and moral support in\r\n       the great work upon which you are engaged.\"\r\n\r\n       The letter was signed by President David Starr Jordan and\r\n       practically all the members of the faculty.\r\n\r\n [400] Similar testimony was given at Murphy's trial.\r\n\r\n [401] It developed later that the Blakes had been living together\r\n       under a contract marriage. Later they went through the\r\n       marriage ceremony. This phase of the case was made much of by\r\n       the defense. Mrs. Blake, however, stood devotedly by her\r\n       husband through all the trying events that followed his arrest\r\n       and imprisonment.\r\n\r\n [402] Of these promissory notes Blake, in his statement to the court\r\n       as published at the time, testified as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Q. How much money were you to get? A. I was to get $10,000.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. For what? What were you to get that $10,000 for? A. Well,\r\n       I was to say nothing about this matter, and that my wife\r\n       would--\r\n\r\n       \"Q. In other words--. A. She was to be provided for. She was to\r\n       get $100 a month. The Court. How? A. To be taken care of when I\r\n       was convicted, you know.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. During your incarceration? A. Yes, and I was to have the\r\n       $10,000.\"\r\n\r\n       Mr. Langdon: \"Q. Who told you he would give you $10,000? A. Mr.\r\n       Murphy.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. What did he say? Just tell us what he said about that. A.\r\n       The money was to be placed in the hands of a third party, who I\r\n       would select, provided the one I selected would be satisfactory\r\n       to them and they felt they could always have confidence in, or\r\n       something of that kind. That $10,000 was to be turned over to\r\n       me immediately upon my sentence--just as soon as my sentence\r\n       was passed the money was to be turned over.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. As soon as the court sentenced you you would receive the\r\n       $10,000 that Murphy put into the hands of this third person? A.\r\n       Yes.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Did he tell you what kind of money it was, or what\r\n       representative value it was. Did he show you any of that? Did\r\n       Murphy show you anything? A. Yes, he showed me $7,500, but he\r\n       did not show me the $10,000 that was put into the hands of the\r\n       party that I selected. He told me that he had it.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. What was this $7,500 that Murphy showed you? In what form\r\n       or shape? A. In notes.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Promissory notes? A. Yes.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Signed by who? A. Signed by Mr. Ruef.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Abraham Ruef? A. Yes.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Who else signed them, if any one? A. They were indorsed by\r\n       his father and sister.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. His father?\r\n\r\n       \"The Court--promissory notes to you from Abraham Ruef, and\r\n       indorsed? A. The promissory notes, your honor, were made out to\r\n       Mr. Murphy, and he was to turn these over to the third party,\r\n       indorsed, I presume, to the third party, who I might select.\r\n       The notes read, 'One year after date I promise to pay to Frank\r\n       J. Murphy,' that is the way the notes read.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. And signed? A. And signed by Mr. Ruef, and then they were\r\n       countersigned or indorsed by his father and sister.\"\r\n\r\n [403] Stevens denied this. Stevens was called before the Grand Jury\r\n       and questioned. He declined to answer on the ground that the\r\n       relations of attorney toward client cannot be violated. Blake\r\n       exonerated Stevens from this obligation. But Stevens held that\r\n       he acted for Murphy as well as Blake. The court held, however,\r\n       that the communications were not privileged. Stevens in his\r\n       testimony which followed, denied everything that tended to\r\n       implicate himself and Murphy in any way with the attempted\r\n       jury fixing, or with the alleged $10,000 fund.\r\n\r\n [404] Among those who testified to Murphy's good character was Rev.\r\n       H. H. Wyman, at that time the head of the Paulist Order at San\r\n       Francisco. Another Paulist priest, Rev. Stark, showed great\r\n       interest in Murphy's welfare.\r\n\r\n       After Murphy's acquittal a story was current in San Francisco\r\n       to the effect that at a dinner given soon after Murphy's\r\n       acquittal, Murphy had promised a present to the Paulist\r\n       Church, St. Mary's, and that Father Stark had announced that a\r\n       plate bearing Murphy's name and the date of his acquittal\r\n       should be placed upon the gift.\r\n\r\n       However unjustified the story may have been, Murphy did give\r\n       St. Mary's a present--a pulpit. On the pulpit was put a plate\r\n       bearing Murphy's name and a date. The incident so incensed\r\n       priests of the Paulist order who were not in sympathy with the\r\n       course of Fathers Wyman and Stark at Murphy's trial, that they\r\n       entered the church with a screw-driver, removed the plate, and\r\n       threw it into San Francisco bay. Later a second plate was put\r\n       upon the pulpit. So far as the writer knows, the second plate\r\n       is still in its place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n                         THE SHOOTING OF HENEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of the sensational events following the trapping of Blake, the\r\nwork of impaneling a jury to try Ruef went steadily on. After months of\r\neffort,[405] a jury was finally sworn to try the case.\r\n\r\nAgain the telling of the sordid story of the city's betrayal commenced.\r\n\r\nGallagher, the pivotal witness, had begun his sorry recital. In the\r\nmidst of it occurred what those who had followed the methods of the\r\ngraft defense had long predicted.\r\n\r\nAssistant District Attorney Heney was shot down.[406] The shooting\r\noccurred in open court during a brief recess.\r\n\r\nHeney was seated at his place at the attorneys' table talking with an\r\nassistant. The jury had left the courtroom. Gallagher had for the moment\r\nleft the witness box and was standing a few feet from Heney waiting\r\nopportunity to speak with him. A few feet further away was Heney's body\r\nguard. In the room were something more than 200 citizens waiting for the\r\ntrial to be resumed. There was the usual confusion which attends a\r\nfive-minute court recess. Court attaches, officials, attorneys, citizens\r\nwere passing to and fro without hindrance.\r\n\r\nThe man who shot Heney had no difficulty in gaining access to the\r\ncourtroom. He walked deliberately to the attorneys' table, and before he\r\nwas even noticed, had fired deliberately at the Assistant Prosecutor.\r\nThe gun was held not more than six inches from Heney's head. In an\r\ninstant, Heney's bodyguard was upon the assassin. But the bodyguard's\r\nefforts came late. Heney, apparently mortally wounded, was lying\r\nunconscious on the floor, the blood gushing from a ragged hole in front\r\nof the right ear, just under the temple.[407]\r\n\r\nHeney's assailant was found to be one Morris Haas, an ex-convict, who\r\nhad succeeded in securing a place on the jury at the former Ruef trial.\r\nHeney had exposed him.[408] When it was demanded of him why he had\r\nattempted to kill Heney, he murmured incoherently, that it was \"for\r\nhumanity's sake.\" Although closely questioned Haas would tell little of\r\nvalue to those who were seeking to get at the real motive behind the\r\nassault. He was thoroughly searched both by Detective Burns and Captain\r\nof Police Thomas Duke, and then taken to the county jail where he was\r\nclosely guarded.\r\n\r\nA short time before the shooting of Heney, Judge Lawlor had had\r\nattorneys of both sides before him to state that in his judgment, he\r\nshould remand Ruef, who was out of jail under heavy bonds, to the\r\ncustody of the Sheriff for the remainder of the trial. Shortly after\r\nthis conference Heney had been shot down.\r\n\r\nWhen the court had re-convened, and the jury had been dismissed for the\r\nday, Judge Lawlor carried out his intention and ordered the Sheriff to\r\ntake charge of Ruef. The shooting had occurred on Friday afternoon,\r\nNovember 13. The court adjourned until the following Monday.[409]\r\n\r\nHeney in the meantime had been taken to a hospital. There it was found\r\nthat the wound was not necessarily fatal. The rumors current that Heney\r\nhad been killed were denied. This tended to calm the excitement.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, San Francisco and all California were aroused as never\r\nbefore in the State's history. In a twinkling, the results of months of\r\nmisrepresentation, ridicule and abuse of the Prosecution were swept\r\naway. Haas' bullet had not killed Heney,[410] but it had awakened the\r\ncommunity to tardy realization of its responsibility.[411] Men who had\r\nlaughed at the Examiner's \"Mutt cartoons\" ridiculing the Prosecution,\r\nnow threatened to mob The Examiner office. Patrons of the\r\ndefense-supporting Chronicle now voiced their utter condemnation of that\r\npaper. Thousands withdrew their subscriptions from the two publications.\r\nThe time was ripe for the demagogue. An unpolitic word from the defense\r\njust then, an incendiary speech from some unwise partisan of the\r\nProsecution, would have been sufficient to have sent a mob marching upon\r\nthe jail in which Haas and Ruef were confined, or upon the residences of\r\nthe indicted bribe-givers, or against the newspaper offices which for\r\nmonths had labored to make the Graft Prosecution unpopular.\r\n\r\nThere was a feeling that the criminal element was too powerfully\r\nintrenched to be reached through the ordinary legal channels. The\r\nfeeling, which had subsided when the Graft Prosecution opened,[412] that\r\nthe graft evil could not be corrected except by extra-legal means, was\r\nto some degree revived.\r\n\r\nIn this emergency, the leaders of the Graft Prosecution, by counseling\r\nmoderation and observance of the law, did yeoman service in the keeping\r\nof good order in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe Citizens' League of Justice[413] called a mass meeting for the\r\nSaturday evening following the shooting. Even in the call, the League\r\nurged there be no breach of the peace.\r\n\r\n\"Francis J. Heney,\" the League's call read, \"has fallen by the hand of\r\nan assassin, shot from behind while fighting at his post in the cause of\r\njustice for the people of this city. He would be the first man to appeal\r\nto the calm reason of the citizens to preserve order and proceed only by\r\nthe processes of law; to look not for vengeance, but to demand swift\r\njustice through the courts. We make the same appeal.\"\r\n\r\nMayor Taylor presided at the meeting. Long before the hour set for the\r\nopening, the auditorium was packed to the doors, with thousands on the\r\noutside clamoring for entrance. Those in charge of the meeting were\r\ncompelled to call it to order several minutes before they had intended.\r\n\r\nProfessor George H. Boke of the University of California Law School, and\r\nmanager of the Citizens' League of Justice, was to introduce Mayor\r\nTaylor. Several minutes before the time set for the meeting, the crowd\r\nstarted a cheer for Heney. The demonstration lasted for fully five\r\nminutes. Then some one started the cry, \"Throw the Examiner out.\"\r\nHundreds half rose from their seats, their eyes bent upon the press\r\ntable where representatives of The Examiner were seated.\r\n\r\nProfessor Boke at once grasped the significance of the movement, and\r\nacted on the instant. Stepping to the fore, he made a brief address\r\nintroducing Mayor Taylor, thereby checking the threatened demonstration.\r\n\r\nMayor Taylor was quick to sound the keynote of the meeting. \"Let us,\" he\r\nsaid in introducing the first speaker, \"see to it that no matter who\r\nelse breaks the law, that we shall not break it.\"[414]\r\n\r\nEvery speaker who followed the Mayor emphasized this. \"Let us,\" said the\r\nRev. William Rader, \"have heads which are cool and minds which are\r\nrational.\"\r\n\r\n\"We stand in this fight,\" said District Attorney Langdon, \"for law and\r\norder. And I want to say to you and ask you to pass it on to your\r\nneighbors, that, as crimes have been committed, those crimes must be\r\npunished, but punished within the law. And I want to say further, that\r\nas the law officers of this city and county, we shall consider any man\r\nwho expresses an opinion or sentiment that we ought to resort to\r\nmeasures extra-judicial, as an enemy of good government.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" demanded James D. Phelan, \"should we take violent steps? Is not\r\nSan Francisco a great, civilized community? Are not our American\r\ninstitutions still intact? They are. And although in the early days of\r\nSan Francisco the Vigilance Committee, an extra-legal tribunal, was\r\nresorted to for the purpose of correcting such abuses, we must remember\r\nthat at that time we were a border State, at that time we were a mining\r\ncamp. Only such a strenuous method would then have succeeded, because\r\njudges who were on the bench were elected by ballot-box stuffers, a\r\ncouncil was elected in the same way. Crime was rampant, nobody was\r\npunished. Then the men of San Francisco organized a tribunal and gave an\r\norderly trial to every offender whom they apprehended, and as a result\r\nthis city was cleansed of crime and remained a model community for\r\ntwenty years.\r\n\r\n\"But conditions now are different. It is true that within the last year\r\nthere has been a feeling in this community that the criminal law had\r\nbroken down, and that we could not, under the law, punish the\r\noffenders; and that the courts, the highest courts, abetted and aided\r\ncriminals by the rankest interpretations, technical interpretations of\r\nthe statutes. They refused to lean on the side of order and justice, and\r\nthey have brought disgrace upon the judiciary of California, all over\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\"But our civilization and our institutions are safe. That vote the other\r\nday, and the election of Judge Dunne, the election two years ago of\r\nJudge Coffey and Judge Lawlor, give us courage and confidence to believe\r\nthat, under the constitution and the laws, we can win our battle if you\r\nonly give us time, without any resort to violence; and we are willing,\r\nthough one hundred days have passed, to pursue that work, because that\r\nis the only way we can do it under the constitution and the laws.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Rudolph Spreckels entered the building he was greeted with\r\ndemonstration. He, too, while expressing great sympathy for his friend\r\nwho had been stricken down, joined in counseling that nothing be done\r\noutside the law.\r\n\r\nWith the urging that no exhibition of mob-violence be added to the\r\nburden of the afflicted community, was given assurance that the Graft\r\nProsecution should go on; that the laws should be upheld; that those\r\nresponsible for the conditions which had been forced upon San Francisco\r\nshould be brought to justice. Whatever danger there was of violence to\r\nmembers of the graft defense, vanished at that Citizens' League of\r\nJustice mass meeting. At its conclusion, resolutions were adopted\r\ncondemning the methods of the defense, declaring unwavering allegiance\r\nof those present to law, and pledging support in the cleansing of the\r\ncity of grafters and boodlers.[415]\r\n\r\nAnother crisis had passed in San Francisco. The situation was not unlike\r\nthat of two years before, when the clamor that drastic means be taken to\r\nfree the city of Ruef's domination, was silenced by announcement that\r\nRudolph Spreckels had guaranteed a fund for the investigation of\r\nmunicipal conditions, and to prosecute those found to be guilty of\r\ncorruption.[416]\r\n\r\nBut even as the citizens met in mass meeting another tragedy of the\r\nGraft Prosecution was enacted. Haas, under the eyes of policemen\r\nspecially detailed to watch him, killed himself or was killed. With him\r\ndied all hope of discovering who had urged him to avenge himself upon\r\nHeney.\r\n\r\nHaas' suicide, if it were suicide; or his murder, if it were murder; is\r\none of the mysteries of the graft cases. He was shot with a derringer.\r\nThe weapon was an inch through at the butt and 5-8 wide at the\r\nmuzzle--certainly an easily discovered weapon by officers practiced in\r\nsearching men. And yet, Haas had, before he was put in his cell, been\r\nthoroughly searched both by Captain Duke[417] of the police force and\r\nDetective Burns. The two officers are certain that Haas had no weapon\r\nupon him. And yet, one theory advanced by his keepers is that Haas had\r\nthe derringer all the time concealed in his shoe. Another theory is that\r\nthe derringer was smuggled in to him. But, with Haas under watchful eyes\r\nof special guards, by whom? Another theory, popular at the time, was\r\nthat Haas had been murdered in his cell. But if murdered--or even if the\r\nderringer were smuggled in to him--what was the motive behind it? These\r\nare questions which, short of some death-bed confession, perhaps, are\r\nnot likely to be answered.\r\n\r\nThose who hurried to his cell at the report of the derringer found Haas\r\ndead. Whether he had shot himself or whether he had been shot, his lips\r\nwere sealed forever.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday following the shooting of Heney, most of the Protestant\r\npastors of San Francisco made the attempted assassination the subject of\r\ntheir sermons. The same course was taken throughout the State generally.\r\nIn the afternoon mass meetings were held in all parts of the State, at\r\nwhich resolutions were adopted condemning the methods of the\r\ndefense,[418] and pledging support to the prosecution.\r\n\r\nTelegrams[419] of condolence and of encouragement poured in from all\r\nparts of the country.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of this popular expression of sympathy, there were\r\nastonishing exhibitions on the part of the associates of those who had\r\nbeen indicted or nearly indicted because of the graft revelations, of\r\nfeeling against Heney. For example, Rev. David J. Evans, of Grace\r\nEpiscopal Church, on the Sunday following the attempted assassination,\r\noffered prayer for the recovery of the stricken prosecutor. Instantly\r\nthere was commotion in the pews. Members of the congregation, by frown\r\nand toss of head, indicated their profound disapproval of their pastor's\r\npetition.[420] But frown and head-toss and open disapproval of the pews\r\nneither stopped the prayer, nor prevented its answer. The prayer was\r\noffered; Heney did not die.\r\n\r\nWithin an hour after Heney had been shot down, three of the foremost\r\nlawyers at the California bar, Hiram W. Johnson, Matt I. Sullivan and\r\nJoseph J. Dwyer, volunteered their services to take up the struggle for\r\ncivic righteousness at the point to which Heney had carried it.\r\n\r\nBut the attorneys for Ruef, having exhausted every other delaying move,\r\nsaw in the shooting of Heney opportunity for further delay. They\r\naccordingly moved for change of venue. Failing here, a motion was made\r\nfor thirty days' delay. This being denied, Ruef's attorneys moved that\r\nthe jury be dismissed. This move failing, an attempt was made to examine\r\nthe twelve men in the jury box to determine whether the shooting had\r\nprejudiced them and unfitted them for jury service. These many motions\r\nwere backed up with affidavits containing all that had been said at the\r\npublic meetings, and all that had been printed in San Francisco\r\nnewspapers, since Heney had been shot. The reading of the voluminous\r\naffidavits consumed hours. The prosecution filed answering affidavits\r\nwhich also consumed time. But Judge Lawlor finally denied all the\r\ncontentions of the defense and ordered the trial to proceed.\r\n\r\nDuring these proceedings, the jury had been locked up in charge of the\r\nregular court officials. The jury had not been in the courtroom when\r\nHeney was shot, and from the moment of the shooting had been shut away\r\nfrom the public. But lest the jury had learned something of the\r\nshooting, and to account for Heney's absence, Judge Lawlor deemed it\r\nincumbent upon him to notify them that Heney had been shot, and to\r\nadmonish them that the transaction so far as the court, the jury, the\r\ndefendant, the People of the State, the counsel, and all other interests\r\ninterested or involved in the trial were concerned was to stand as\r\nthough it had not occurred. This Judge Lawlor did.[421]\r\n\r\nThe trial itself was not unlike the other graft trials. The Supervisors\r\ntold the story of their bribery. Gallagher told how Ruef had given him\r\nthe money, and how he had given it to Supervisor Furey. Furey testified\r\nthat he had received the money from Gallagher because of his vote to\r\ngrant the overhead trolley permit to the United Railroads. The story had\r\nby this time become sadly familiar to the people of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe trouble experienced with witnesses at former trials characterized\r\nthis trial as well.\r\n\r\nAlex. Lathem, for example, at one time Ruef's chauffeur, disappeared\r\nfrom the State about the time the trial was to begin. He was brought\r\nback from Oregon under extradition, charged with having accepted a bribe\r\nto leave the jurisdiction of the court. On the stand,[422] Lathem\r\nrepudiated important evidence which he had given before the Grand Jury,\r\nand to which he had made affidavit. As a minor incident of the graft\r\ntrials, Lathem, because of this incident, was indicted for perjury.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the backwardness of certain of its witnesses, the\r\nprosecution succeeded in getting its case before the jury. The jury\r\nfound Ruef guilty as charged. He was sentenced to fourteen years' penal\r\nservitude at San Quentin prison.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [405] Seventy-two days were required to impanel the jury before\r\n       which Ruef was tried, fifty days being devoted to actual court\r\n       work. There were summoned 1,450 talesmen, of whom 446 were\r\n       examined. Six jurors were denied their freedom for forty-two\r\n       days before the jury was completed. Blake, arrested for\r\n       jury-fixing, was trapped, tried and convicted before the jury\r\n       was completed. Two of Ruef's attorneys were, during the\r\n       impaneling of the jury, indicted for alleged connection with\r\n       Blake's attempt to influence the jury in Ruef's favor.\r\n\r\n [406] There is, so far as the writer can find, no evidence that the\r\n       Graft Defense or its agents employed Haas to kill Heney any\r\n       more than there is evidence that the Graft Defense or its\r\n       agents employed Pauduveris to murder the pivotal witness,\r\n       Gallagher. But that Haas was urged to kill Heney because of\r\n       the exposure of Haas's previous record at the first Ruef trial\r\n       is well established.\r\n\r\n       \"I was urged frequently,\" said Haas in a confession made to\r\n       Langdon and Burns, \"to kill Heney by certain persons whose\r\n       names I will not tell you, and I also talked to other people\r\n       about killing Heney and was advised by them not to do it. In\r\n       addition to that, certain persons approached me several times\r\n       and referred to the time I was thrown off the Ruef jury,\r\n       saying: 'I'd never stand that sort of a roast,' and 'I'd kill\r\n       a man who did that to me,' and similar things.\"\r\n\r\n       Who urged Haas to do this thing, and what was their motive?\r\n       Haas alone could have answered the first question. But the\r\n       bullet that ended his life sealed his lips forever.\r\n\r\n       Of Haas's purpose in getting on the first Ruef jury we have\r\n       some testimony. Joseph Brachman, a close associate of Ruef,\r\n       who had known Haas for nearly a quarter of a century, said in\r\n       an interview published in the San Francisco Call, November 15,\r\n       1908:\r\n\r\n       \"When Ruef was on trial in the Parkside case, on the bribery\r\n       charge, I heard that Haas had been called on the jury panel.\r\n       At that time I was frequently in consultation with Ruef, every\r\n       day, in fact. But I was afraid to go to Ruef with what I knew\r\n       of Haas, so I went to one of his lawyers--I won't say which\r\n       one--and told him of the record of Haas. I told him that Haas\r\n       was a bad man and an ex-convict. I said that Ruef should\r\n       challenge him.\r\n\r\n       \"I was in court the day that Haas qualified and passed into\r\n       the jury. Again I told his attorney that Haas was a bad man,\r\n       to get rid of him, but nothing was done. When Heney produced\r\n       the evidence showing that Haas was an ex-convict I was in\r\n       court, also. I met Haas after he had been disqualified. Haas\r\n       told me the reason why he stayed on the jury and why his\r\n       record was not made public by the defense of Ruef. He told me\r\n       that he expected $4,000 from Ruef for his services on the\r\n       Parkside case jury. He said that he was hard up, that he was\r\n       in debt, that he owed money on his saloon and that if he had\r\n       been permitted to stay on the jury he would have been able,\r\n       with the $4,000 to be paid him by Ruef, to clear himself of\r\n       debt.\r\n\r\n       \"He also told me, Haas did, on the day that he was\r\n       disqualified, that he was going to 'kill one of the\r\n       prosecutors.' He did not say which one, but he frequently\r\n       repeated to me, that he was 'going to get one of the\r\n       prosecutors.' I met him many times and often, frequently he\r\n       told me that he was 'going to get one of the prosecutors.'\"\r\n\r\n [407] Physicians state that Heney's escape from death was by a\r\n       hair's breadth. Had the bullet, striking as it did, taken any\r\n       other course death would have been inevitable.\r\n\r\n [408] See Chapter XXIII.\r\n\r\n [409] \"Will they,\" demanded The Call the morning after Heney had\r\n       been shot down, \"stop at nothing? Are not stealing, perjury,\r\n       bribery, dynamiting, murder, enough? Must the course of\r\n       justice in this community run the gamut of violence, as well\r\n       as of slander and pettifogging obstruction?\r\n\r\n       \"Apparently it must. But there is at least no longer any\r\n       reason to doubt where the responsibility lies. A bare chance,\r\n       the momentary tremor of an assassin's hand, may have saved the\r\n       life of Francis J. Heney to this community. There will be no\r\n       tremor in the finger of scorn that points past the miserable\r\n       wretch that did the shooting to the men that inspired it. A\r\n       worthless crank, of course. It always is. Dirty hands for\r\n       dirty work. But softer hands and keener brains plan it. And\r\n       the community will waste no wrath on the miserable tool, now\r\n       cowering in jail. It was not he who has dogged the steps of\r\n       Francis J. Heney these two years with hired thugs. It was not\r\n       he who has filled the courtrooms with professional ruffians.\r\n       It was not he who dynamited Gallagher--or hired it done. Least\r\n       of all was it he who made a joke of that crime and sought to\r\n       make a joke and a byword of the heroic Heney--'poor Beany.'\"\r\n\r\n [410] While Heney lay wounded at San Francisco, and Haas lay dead,\r\n       another tragedy growing out of the Graft Prosecution was being\r\n       enacted on the other side of the globe. John Krause, who had\r\n       been T. V. Halsey's assistant at the time of the Pacific\r\n       States Telephone briberies, killed himself on the steamer\r\n       Adriatic as it plied from Cherbourg, France, to Queenstown,\r\n       Ireland. Krause had disappeared from San Francisco in\r\n       December, 1907. It was never charged that Krause was a\r\n       principal to the bribery transactions, or that he had even\r\n       guilty knowledge of them. His only possible connection with\r\n       the graft cases was as a witness against the Pacific States\r\n       Telephone and Telegraph Company officials.\r\n\r\n [411] \"A great work,\" said Hiram W. Johnson, in an interview printed\r\n       in the San Francisco Call, November 14, 1908, \"undertaken and\r\n       accomplished, though not yet wholly completed, has been\r\n       retarded for a day by an assassin's bullet. When Frank Heney\r\n       fell today while in the performance of his duty, decency and\r\n       the right were stricken. For two years this one man has\r\n       persevered in the right, for right's sake alone. Without\r\n       compensation, sacrificing a great legal practice, giving\r\n       without complaint the best years of his life, Francis J.\r\n       Heney, facing all the combined forces of evil in this\r\n       community and State, has stood unflinchingly at his post,\r\n       making the fight that is the fight of all of us. Daily abuse\r\n       and vilification have been his portion and reward. In spite of\r\n       it, where a weaker man would have faltered, Heney has\r\n       persevered. He has done in seeking to make equality before the\r\n       law an assurance in this State, all that a strong and a brave\r\n       man could do. Were he to pass away tonight he'd need no other\r\n       monument than the work he has done. For generations his expose\r\n       of rottenness in San Francisco, his prosecutions of the\r\n       criminal rich will live and make this city and State better.\r\n       He has been shot simply because he was fighting for the right.\r\n       Not alone has he been wounded; but the community and the\r\n       commonwealth have suffered the injury.\r\n\r\n       \"We who were with him in the early days of the struggle, and\r\n       knew his every mood; who saw him at his work day and night,\r\n       and loved the qualities that made it possible for him to\r\n       accomplish what he has, can not express our horror and\r\n       indignation and anger at his attempted assassination. May God\r\n       speed his recovery.\"\r\n\r\n [412] See Chapter IV.\r\n\r\n [413] The Citizens' League of Justice was organized immediately\r\n       after the attempted assassination of Witness Gallagher by\r\n       means of dynamite. Those immediately connected with the\r\n       prosecution, it had been amply demonstrated, were risking\r\n       their lives. In the Citizens' League of Justice was proposed\r\n       an organization, entirely separate and apart from the graft\r\n       prosecution, to back the prosecution. The idea originated with\r\n       Bruce Porter, the artist. Rev. Charles N. Lathrop, of the\r\n       Church of the Advent, became interested. The initial meeting\r\n       was held at Father Lathrop's house. While the League had no\r\n       connection with the prosecution, it became most effective in\r\n       support of the prosecution group. Professor George H. Boke, of\r\n       the University of California Law School, accepted the\r\n       hazardous position of the League's executive officer. In spite\r\n       of the fact that he was jeopardizing his position at the State\r\n       University by his course, Professor Boke did much effective\r\n       work in bringing the conditions which confronted San Francisco\r\n       squarely before the public. Matt I. Sullivan, who afterwards\r\n       became Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court, served as the\r\n       League's president.\r\n\r\n [414] Dr. Taylor's observations on this point were as follows: \"Let\r\n       us see to it that no matter who else breaks the law, that we\r\n       shall not break it. In this crisis, we must, above all things,\r\n       keep our heads. We must, above all things, while resolute and\r\n       determined, be self-restrained.\r\n\r\n       \"San Francisco has had many afflictions. She now has this\r\n       additional affliction of the assassination of one who stood\r\n       for the people's rights; of one who was fearlessly engaged in\r\n       the important and priceless business of civic regeneration,\r\n       and who, while in the act of performing the greatest of all\r\n       duties as a citizen, was laid low by the bullets of an\r\n       assassin.\r\n\r\n       \"But let us not add to the affliction the affliction of\r\n       breaking the peace. Let us, above all things, as I have said,\r\n       keep ourselves restrained. Let us not add to the afflictions\r\n       that are upon us the affliction of mob law. Let us go about\r\n       our business, whatever we may do in this matter, in a peaceful\r\n       way, but in a resolute way, in a determined way. I am\r\n       satisfied that the officers of the law will do their duty. I\r\n       am satisfied that the judges will do their duty, and that our\r\n       juries will do their duty. And if they, each one of them,\r\n       perform faithfully the functions upon his part, we have\r\n       nothing to fear, and we shall see that those who are guilty\r\n       are punished and are rightfully punished.\"\r\n\r\n [415] The following resolutions were adopted at the meeting:\r\n\r\n       \"Whereas, following unparalleled disaster from the elements\r\n       our unfortunate city fell upon times of unprecedented civic\r\n       corruption, necessitating the tearing down of the wreckage of\r\n       government, and the rebuilding of our civic structure on\r\n       foundations of law and justice; and\r\n\r\n       \"Whereas, the first labor necessary was the prosecution of\r\n       criminals, bribe givers, bribe takers and brokers in\r\n       corruption; and\r\n\r\n       \"Whereas, the prosecution, beset with many difficulties,\r\n       obtained its evidence in the only way that such evidence could\r\n       be obtained; and\r\n\r\n       \"Whereas, in the subsequent attempt to convict the guilty\r\n       there was developed a vast conspiracy to thwart the ends of\r\n       justice, which conspiracy has involved social boycott and\r\n       unjust and coercive business pressure, has openly employed\r\n       thugs to terrorize the officers of the law, has employed\r\n       lawyers to browbeat and insult witnesses, prosecutors and the\r\n       judges on the bench, and to waste the time and money and to\r\n       exhaust the patience of the people by useless and technical\r\n       delays, and which conspiracy has moreover involved so large a\r\n       part of our public press that many of our people have been\r\n       deprived of the truth and have been fed upon poisoned lies;\r\n       and\r\n\r\n       \"Whereas, up to the present time the law as administered has\r\n       proved inadequate to secure that prompt and certain\r\n       application of justice, which must be the basis of social\r\n       order; and\r\n\r\n       \"Whereas, out of this conspiracy grew plots to kidnap, and\r\n       actual kidnapping; plots to bribe juries, and actual jury\r\n       bribing; plots to assassinate witnesses and an attempt to\r\n       assassinate a witness by dynamite; and out of it also grew\r\n       plots to assassinate the prosecutors, and the attempted\r\n       assassination of the bravest friend that San Francisco has\r\n       known, Francis J. Heney;\r\n\r\n       \"Therefore be it resolved, that here and now we declare our\r\n       unwavering allegiance to law, and that if the criminal law be\r\n       found to be so framed as to permit the escape of civic\r\n       malefactors we shall see to it that the law be amended; that\r\n       if the lax administration of the criminal law be due to\r\n       misinterpretation by judges, we shall see to it that men be\r\n       placed upon the bench capable of construing the law.\r\n\r\n       \"Be it further resolved, that we call upon the Supervisors to\r\n       provide adequate funds for the District Attorney's office to\r\n       secure the detection, prosecution and conviction of criminals,\r\n       high or low, and the full protection of officers in the\r\n       discharge of their duties;\r\n\r\n       \"Be it further resolved, that we demand the truth from our\r\n       public press, and shall see to it that our people are informed\r\n       of the facts that they may judge of those who by lying and\r\n       misrepresentation are perverting public opinion.\r\n\r\n       \"Be it further resolved, that we solemnly assert our utmost\r\n       confidence in the law-abiding character of our people; that we\r\n       here declare our gratitude for the inestimable service\r\n       rendered us by the office of the District Attorney in the\r\n       restoration of reputable and responsible government; and that\r\n       we stand firm in our determination to indorse and to aid that\r\n       office to the end that all persons accused of crime shall be\r\n       fairly tried and their guilt or innocence be finally\r\n       established in accordance with the provisions of law.\r\n\r\n       \"To these ends we pledge ourselves, that our beloved city may\r\n       be purged of boodlers and grafters and be a better home for\r\n       ourselves and our children.\r\n\r\n       \"Be it further resolved, that we send word to our wounded\r\n       champion, that his labors for us are appreciated and that his\r\n       sufferings for our sake are not in vain.\"\r\n\r\n [416] See Chapter IV.\r\n\r\n [417] Captain Duke, at an investigation which followed, testified:\r\n       \"At Mr. Burns's suggestion, we took Haas into the room off the\r\n       courtroom occupied by the stenographers. First we made a\r\n       slight search, and then I said to Mr. Burns: 'Are you sure we\r\n       searched him thoroughly?' and we went over him again. I felt\r\n       down to his shoes. I always search a man that way, for when I\r\n       first went on the police force I had an experience with a\r\n       Chinaman, whom Policeman Helms, who was recently killed, and\r\n       myself had arrested. We found a dagger in his shoe, and since\r\n       then I have always examined a man's feet. I will state that I\r\n       felt the man's shoes the other day after they had been put on\r\n       the corpse and the derringer placed in them, and from the\r\n       bulge I noticed then I am sure that I would have felt the\r\n       weapon had it been in his shoe at the time of the arrest. We\r\n       were looking for anything that we could find. From something\r\n       the man said--that he didn't care if he lived or not--I\r\n       thought that he might make an attempt to commit suicide.\r\n\r\n       \"It would have been an utter impossibility for the derringer\r\n       to have been anywhere else than in the man's shoe,\" Duke\r\n       continued. \"If it was in his shoe it would have been under the\r\n       stocking and the man would have had it there 29 hours before\r\n       he killed himself. It would have made a mark on the flesh or\r\n       interfered with his walking, and he did not even limp. If the\r\n       cartridges had been in the shoe they could have got under the\r\n       foot and the man could not have walked.\"\r\n\r\n [418] Neither press nor defending lawyers were spared in the\r\n       criticism. \"We have,\" said Rev. Bradford Leavitt of the First\r\n       Unitarian Church at San Francisco, \"dreamed that we were\r\n       living under the government of laws, whereas we were living\r\n       under the government of newspapers hired by corrupt\r\n       corporations, and the enemies of civic decency.\"\r\n\r\n       \"The lawyers who are paid to thwart this Graft Prosecution,\"\r\n       said Charles S. Wheeler, \"have proceeded with deliberate plan\r\n       to destroy the effectiveness of the prosecution by withdrawing\r\n       the support of the people. In this way they have reached the\r\n       home of every individual. They have brought cunningly into the\r\n       home their hireling periodicals, and a press misguided or\r\n       worse, has been largely instrumental in aiding their desire.\"\r\n\r\n [419] President Roosevelt's telegram to Mr. Spreckels was as follows:\r\n\r\n                                      \"White House, Nov. 19, 1908.\r\n\r\n       \"To Rudolph Spreckels, San Francisco.\r\n\r\n       \"Am inexpressibly shocked at the attempted assassination of\r\n       Heney and most earnestly hope he will recover. The infamous\r\n       character of the would-be assassin no less than the infamous\r\n       character of the deed call attention in a striking way to the\r\n       true character of the forces against which Heney and you and\r\n       your associates have been struggling. Every decent American who\r\n       has the honor and interest of the country at heart should join\r\n       not only in putting a stop to the cause of violent crime of\r\n       which this man's act is but one of the symptoms, but also in\r\n       stamping out the hideous corruption in which men like this\r\n       would-be assassin are bred and flourish, and that can only be\r\n       done by warring as Heney has warred relentlessly against every\r\n       man who is guilty of corrupt practices without any regard to\r\n       his social standing and his prominence in the world of politics\r\n       or the world of business. I earnestly hope that Heney will\r\n       recover, and I give utterance to what I know would be Heney's\r\n       wish when I say that I earnestly hope that whether he recovers\r\n       or not there be no faltering in the work in which Heney has\r\n       been so gallant and efficient a leader.\r\n\r\n             \"9:10 A.

I hope you will accept my deepest\r\n       sympathy. Like all good American citizens, I hold your husband\r\n       in peculiar regard for the absolutely fearless way in which he\r\n       has attacked and exposed corruption without any regard to the\r\n       political or social prominence of the offenders or to the\r\n       dangerous character of the work. Your husband has taken his\r\n       life in his hands in doing this great task for our people and\r\n       is entitled to the credit and esteem, and above all, to the\r\n       heartiest support of all good citizens. The infamous character\r\n       of the man who has assassinated him should add not only to the\r\n       horror and detestation felt for the deed, but also to the\r\n       determination of all decent citizens to stamp out the power of\r\n       all men of his kind.\r\n\r\n                                             \"THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\"\r\n\r\n [420] Grace Episcopal Church is attended by many of the most\r\n       prominent citizens of San Francisco. At the time of the\r\n       shooting of Heney, several prominent Episcopalians were under\r\n       indictment. In spite of the intense feeling in his\r\n       congregation, against the prosecution, Rev. Mr. Evans\r\n       continued to give the work of the District Attorney's office\r\n       his approval. An era of petty persecutions for Mr. Evans\r\n       followed. He was finally brought to resign his pastorate and\r\n       accept a less important charge at Palo Alto.\r\n\r\n       In this connection it is interesting to note that in spite of\r\n       powerful opposition to the prosecution of prominent\r\n       Episcopalian laymen, the Convocation of the Church held at San\r\n       Francisco in August, 1907, adopted the following resolutions\r\n       unanimously:\r\n       \"Whereas, Our government is imperiled by the criminal use of\r\n       wealth to influence legislation; and\r\n\r\n       \"Whereas, Existing conditions in San Francisco present a moral\r\n       issue; therefore be it\r\n\r\n       \"Resolved, That, in the judgment of this convocation, bribery\r\n       is always a crime deserving punishment, and, furthermore, that\r\n       duty commands every Christian man to exert himself to foster a\r\n       public recognition of the quality of the crime.\"\r\n\r\n [421] Judge Lawlor's statement to the jury was as follows:\r\n       \"Gentlemen of the Jury: I have a few words to say to you\r\n       before this trial is resumed at this time. Since you have been\r\n       sworn as jurors the Court has on many occasions, with\r\n       elaborateness and repetition, sought to convey to your minds\r\n       an understanding of your duties as jurors in this case. It has\r\n       been pointed out to you that to the charge which is on trial\r\n       here, the defendant, Abraham Ruef, has interposed a plea of\r\n       not guilty. That charge, considered in connection with that\r\n       plea, puts in issue, for the determination of this Court and\r\n       jury, the allegations of that charge. You have been sworn as\r\n       jurors to pass upon the facts in the case and to apply those\r\n       facts, when resolved from the evidence, to the rules of law\r\n       which the Court shall finally state to you to govern you in\r\n       the rendition of your verdict. These many admonitions, as it\r\n       has also been pointed out to you from time to time, are\r\n       founded upon a provision of the law which makes it the duty of\r\n       the Court to administer those admonitions.\r\n\r\n       \"The purpose of the law requiring those admonitions to be\r\n       given is that when a jury is sworn to try an action it shall\r\n       divest itself of all matters which theretofore might have\r\n       found lodgment in the minds of the members and to proceed to\r\n       render a verdict solely upon the matters which shall be\r\n       brought to the attention of the jury in the due course of\r\n       judicial proceedings. These constant reminders of that duty\r\n       are calculated to keep the sense of jurors alive to a full\r\n       compliance therewith.\r\n\r\n       \"I doubt if anything I could say at this time would tend to\r\n       amplify what has already been declared from time to time in\r\n       that behalf, but in view of a transaction that occurred in the\r\n       courtroom on the afternoon of Friday, November 13, 1908, the\r\n       Court deems it proper to re-emphasize with all the power that\r\n       it may command the duty of the jury to proceed to the further\r\n       discharge of its duty at this time in utter disregard of that\r\n       transaction. The Court realizes that the jurors may have heard\r\n       or seen a part of that transaction, or that phases of that\r\n       transaction may have been communicated to the jury. Now,\r\n       without regard to what extent that assumption may be\r\n       justified, the Court desires the jurors to in every manner\r\n       relieve their minds of any impression or anything that they\r\n       have heard, or anything that has been said, or anything that\r\n       has been communicated, or that shall hereafter he communicated\r\n       concerning that transaction; in other words, we are to resume\r\n       this trial at this time at precisely the point that had been\r\n       reached when the recess, during which the transaction\r\n       occurred, was declared.\r\n\r\n       \"I may state to you generally, that on that occasion Mr.\r\n       Francis J. Heney, the Assistant District Attorney, was shot by\r\n       a man bearing the name of Morris Haas; that Mr. Heney was\r\n       wounded as a result of that assault. Happily the injury was\r\n       not a serious one, and at this time there is every indication\r\n       that Mr. Heney will recover from that injury.\r\n\r\n       \"Now, that transaction, so far as this Court and the jury, the\r\n       defendant at the bar, the People of the State of California,\r\n       the counsel and all other interests interested or involved in\r\n       this trial are concerned, is to stand as though it had not\r\n       occurred; no person is to be charged with any responsibility\r\n       for that transaction; this is not the place for the\r\n       consideration of that transaction.\r\n\r\n       \"It may be stated also to you that the assailant afterward\r\n       took his own life while he was confined in the County Jail\r\n       upon his arrest in connection with that transaction.\r\n\r\n       \"And neither matter, I repeat, should find any place in your\r\n       minds. It should not in any manner form anything in the nature\r\n       of bias or prejudice concerning anyone.\r\n\r\n       \"This Court would despair of having the law administered upon\r\n       the charge at bar if the jurors did not in every manner comply\r\n       with the admonition of the Court to exclude that transaction\r\n       entirely from their minds.\"\r\n\r\n [422] Lathem testified before the Grand Jury that about the time the\r\n       bribe money had been passed he had driven Ruef to the Hirsch\r\n       Bros. store, where Ruef had obtained a shirt box. He had then\r\n       driven Ruef to the offices of the United Railroads. Ruef had\r\n       entered the offices with the box. He had come out later with\r\n       the box and a package. With box and package he had gone to his\r\n       own office, and from there, taking the box and package with\r\n       him, he had been driven to the safe deposit vaults of the\r\n       Western National Bank.\r\n\r\n       Lathem did not testify before the Grand Jury until after Ruef\r\n       had confessed, and then Lathem testified with Ruef's consent.\r\n       It is a significant fact that Lathem was sent out of the State\r\n       the first time not in the interest of Ruef but of Tirey L.\r\n       Ford, head of the United Railroads law department. Lathem went\r\n       to Colorado on an automobile trip with the father-in-law of\r\n       Luther Brown, one of the United Railroad detectives. Lathem's\r\n       wife was permitted to accompany them in the automobile. They\r\n       stopped at the best hotels. Lathem was paid $150 a month.\r\n\r\n       The importance of Lathem's testimony lies in the fact that at\r\n       the time he took Ruef with the shirt-box to Ford's office,\r\n       Ford had just received from the Relief corporation officials\r\n       $50,000 in small currency, which made two large bundles, which\r\n       were carried to Ford's office by Abbott and himself and placed\r\n       in Ford's desk. This was at the noon hour. A little after one\r\n       o'clock Ruef went to the Western Pacific Safety Deposit vaults\r\n       where he then had a deposit box. The cubic contents of this\r\n       box was not sufficient to accommodate those two bundles. Ruef\r\n       at that time secured two additional boxes. The cubic contents\r\n       of all three boxes together was just sufficient to nicely\r\n       accommodate said two bundles.\r\n\r\n       The theory of the prosecution was that Ruef carried bribe\r\n       money in box and package.\r\n\r\n       At the trial, Lathem stated that the story which he had told\r\n       before the Grand Jury was not true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n                            THE CALHOUN TRIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial of Patrick Calhoun for offering a bribe to Supervisor Fred\r\nNicholas began immediately after the holidays, following the Ruef\r\ntrials. The trial brought into play all the machinery of the opposition\r\nat its worst to the prosecution. At all points the defense was carried\r\non on a larger scale than at the former trials. There were more and\r\nbetter lawyers employed by the defendant; there were more thugs in\r\nevidence in the courtroom; there was greater activity on the part of the\r\ndetectives, spies and agents engaged to meet the efforts of the men\r\nworking under Detective Burns.\r\n\r\nDue largely to the activity of this army of opposition to the\r\nprosecution, the weakness of the methods of enforcing the criminal law\r\nwas emphasized even more than at the other trials, and the defects shown\r\nup more glaringly.\r\n\r\nTo secure a jury to try Ruef, for example, 1450 talesmen were called.\r\nThis was regarded as a record. But before a jury had been secured to try\r\nCalhoun 2370 veniremen had been called into court, and no less than 922\r\nexamined. Thus, for every juror who sat at the Calhoun trial, 197\r\ntalesmen were called, and seventy-seven were questioned by the\r\nattorneys.\r\n\r\nThe estimated number of words contained in the transcript of the\r\nexamination of these talesmen was in millions. To conduct this\r\nexamination three months were required. The securing of a jury to try\r\nRuef occupied the time of the court for two months only. But it must be\r\nnoted that the securing of the Calhoun and the Ruef juries occupied five\r\nmonths--to try charges contained in two indictments, whereas in all the\r\ngraft cases 160 indictments had been brought.\r\n\r\nThe defendants who preceded Calhoun to trial had an army of attorneys to\r\nrepresent them. But Calhoun's line of legal representatives was quite\r\ndouble that of any of his fellow graft defendants who had been caught in\r\nthe prosecution drag-net.\r\n\r\nProminent in Mr. Calhoun's defense appeared A. A. Moore, Stanley Moore,\r\nLewis F. Byington, Earl Rogers, J. J. Barrett and Alexander King,\r\nsupported by the giant of the California bar, Garret McEnerney. That the\r\nmaster mind of Garret McEnerney was directing many of the graft defense\r\ncases had been intimated from time to time, but there is no question\r\nabout McEnerney's part in the defense of Calhoun.\r\n\r\nAnd opposed to the strongest men of the California bar, The People had\r\ntwo representatives. One of them, Heney, was serving without pay, was\r\nstill a sick man not having fully recovered from his wound inflicted but\r\na few months before, and worn out from the continued effort of a\r\nthree-years' fight to get at the root of municipal corruption in San\r\nFrancisco. The second, a regularly employed Deputy District Attorney,\r\nJohn J. O'Gara, was receiving $300 a month for his services. It is not\r\nunlikely that some of the best of the attorneys for the defense, for\r\ndefending Mr. Calhoun, received as much in a day. Compared with the\r\narmy of lawyers for the defense, the representation of The People was\r\npitifully small.\r\n\r\nThrough the long, grueling contest of the trial, lasting for five months\r\nand eight days,[423] Heney and O'Gara were kept under constant strain,\r\nwhile the defendant's attorneys relieved one another when their labors\r\nbecame irksome.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the hammering and of the technical quibbling was directed\r\nagainst Heney. Heney, still suffering from the effects of his wound,\r\nreceived at the Ruef trial, worn-out, over-worked, harassed in the\r\npublic prints, would at times become thoroughly exasperated. Every\r\nindication of impatience on his part, or of temper, was made subject of\r\nattack in the opposing newspapers.[424] These attacks, long persisted\r\nin, did their part in the general campaign to weary the public with the\r\nprosecution, and undermine confidence in Heney.\r\n\r\nThe examination of talesmen for jury service showed the results of this\r\nlong-continued campaign. Many talesmen announced their sympathy with the\r\ndefendants, and deplored the prosecution, which they appeared to\r\nbelieve had brought shame upon and injured the city. Some went so far as\r\nto call the prosecution of Calhoun an outrage.[425] Others intimated\r\nthat the giving of bribe money might have been justifiable.[426] Such\r\nexpressions, coming from men of average intelligence and ordinarily\r\nlaw-abiding, showed conclusively that the persistent efforts of the\r\ndefense to poison the public mind against the prosecution was at last\r\nbringing results.\r\n\r\nBut after months of effort a jury was secured to hear the case and the\r\ntrial began.\r\n\r\nHeney, in his opening statement to the jury, set forth the prosecution\r\nexpected to prove that Ruef authorized James L. Gallagher to offer the\r\nbribe to Supervisor Nicholas; that Ruef afterwards gave the money to\r\nGallagher to pay Nicholas; that Calhoun authorized Ruef, either through\r\nTirey L. Ford, or personally, or both, to make the offer to Gallagher\r\nand to authorize Gallagher to make the offer to Nicholas.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution showed by Gallagher that the offer had been made to\r\nNicholas and to every member of the Board of Supervisors with the\r\nexception of Rea. In this, Gallagher was corroborated by the\r\nSupervisors. Not only had the offer been made, but the bribe money had\r\nbeen paid.\r\n\r\nGallagher testified that he had received $85,000 from Ruef to be\r\ndistributed among the Supervisors for their votes which gave the United\r\nRailroads its overhead trolley permit, and that, after keeping out\r\n$15,000 for himself, he had distributed the money among them, giving to\r\nSupervisor Nicholas $4000 of the amount.\r\n\r\nSupervisor Nicholas testified that Gallagher had offered him the bribe\r\nand had paid him the money.\r\n\r\nBy the officials of the United States Mint, the prosecution showed that\r\n$200,000, about the time of the bribery, had been turned over to General\r\nTirey L. Ford, on order from Mr. Calhoun. The $200,000 could not be\r\naccounted for by the available books of the United Railroads. Ruef and\r\nFord were shown to have been in close touch with each other during the\r\nperiod.[427]\r\n\r\nBut nobody could be found who had seen Ford pass $200,000 to Mr. Ruef.\r\n\r\nHere was, perhaps, a weak link in the prosecution's chain of evidence.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun did not, however, put General Ford on the stand to tell what\r\nhe did with the money. Neither did Mr. Calhoun put Mr. Ruef on the stand\r\nto testify as to the source of the $85,000 which Ruef gave to Gallagher\r\nto pay the Supervisors for their votes by which the trolley permit was\r\nawarded to the United Railroads.\r\n\r\nBut, however weak the link between Ford and Ruef, there was no weakness\r\nin the link between Calhoun and Ford. By evidence that could not be\r\ndisputed, the prosecution showed that Ford got $200,000 through Calhoun.\r\n\r\nFrank A. Leach, Director of the United States Mint at San Francisco,\r\ntestified that Calhoun, with General Ford, had called upon him at the\r\nMint sometime between May 22 and May 24, 1906.[428] Calhoun called,\r\nLeach testified, to ascertain how $200,000, which had been transferred\r\nfrom the East to his credit.\"[429] could be drawn out in certain sums\r\nin favor of such persons as he might designate.\r\n\r\nLeach testified he had furnished Calhoun with the desired information.\r\n\r\nFord afterwards appeared at the Mint with an order from Mr. Calhoun for\r\n$50,000,[430] which was paid to him. Later, Calhoun telegraphed to Leach\r\nfrom Cleveland, Ohio, to pay Ford a second $50,000; and still later the\r\n$100,000 remaining.[431]\r\n\r\nThe Mint officials paid Ford the money in accordance with Mr. Calhoun's\r\ndirections. Mr. Calhoun offered no evidence to show why this\r\nconsiderable sum was paid to General Ford, or what General Ford was\r\nsupposed to have done with it. Mr. Calhoun, when the last of the\r\n$200,000 had been turned over to General Ford, had given Mr. Leach a\r\nreceipt[432] in full for the amount.\r\n\r\nBut what was quite as extraordinary as this direct evidence against Mr.\r\nCalhoun was the offer of the District Attorney to meet the defense's\r\ncharges and insinuations against the prosecution. Rudolph Spreckels was\r\ncalled to the stand. The attorneys for the defense were invited to ask\r\nhim any questions they saw fit.\r\n\r\n\"From the time we attempted to impanel this jury,\" said Heney, in\r\nextending this invitation, \"the attorneys for the defendant have been\r\nattempting to try Rudolph Spreckels, James D. Phelan and God knows who\r\nelse. By insinuations they have been endeavoring to get into the mind of\r\nthis jury the idea that Mr. Spreckels was back of this prosecution for\r\nmalicious purposes and for gain, for profit, to get hold of the United\r\nRailroads. I told them when they were making those insinuations that I\r\nproposed to throw down the bars to them; that I proposed to force them\r\nto the proof; that I would put the witnesses upon the stand and would\r\nnot object to a single question asked them.\r\n\r\n\"The witness, Spreckels, is now upon the stand, and we won't object to\r\ntheir asking him anything on earth, from the time he was born down to\r\nthe present day, to the present minute.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most frequent charges which had been made against the\r\nprosecution was that it had expended money wrongfully. Rogers asked for\r\na statement of the prosecution's receipts and disbursements.\r\n\r\nMr. Spreckels announced his willingness to account for every dollar\r\nexpended, but refused, until he should be directed by the Court, to give\r\nthe names of the contributors to the fund.[433]\r\n\r\n\"Will you,\" broke in Heney addressing Calhoun's lawyers, \"produce an\r\nitemized account of moneys expended in the defense of these matters?\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon?\" questioned Rogers.\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" said Heney, \"will you produce an itemized account of moneys\r\nexpended in opposition to these prosecutions?\"\r\n\r\nThe defense did not seize this opportunity to clear itself of the not\r\nunreasonable suspicion that money had been used to influence jurors to\r\nvote for acquittals; to get witnesses out of the State; to corrupt\r\nagents of the prosecution; and perhaps to attempt murder. On the\r\ncontrary, the attorneys for the defense denounced Mr. Heney's suggestion\r\nas \"misconduct.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Spreckels stated his willingness to furnish itemized statement of\r\nthe prosecution's expenditures. This he did. Furthermore, he submitted\r\nhimself to rigorous cross-examination regarding the items of his\r\naccount. But the clever attorneys for the defense uncovered nothing upon\r\nwhich charge of wrongful expenditure or questionable methods could be\r\nbased.[434]\r\n\r\nThe charge that Spreckels had engaged in the Graft Prosecution to injure\r\nthe United Railroads came to as sorry an ending. By competent witnesses\r\nit was shown that the prosecution had been planned, and the preliminary\r\nwork done, before the bribe-money in the trolley deal had passed.\r\nFurthermore, it was shown that Spreckels had offered to assist Calhoun\r\nto have the time of his franchises extended, if such extension were\r\nnecessary for practical installation of the conduit electric system,\r\nasking only that the unsightly poles and overhead wires be not inflicted\r\nupon the city. It was only when Calhoun, dealing with a Board of\r\nSupervisors suspected of corruption, showed conclusively that he\r\nproposed to install an over-head trolley system, whether the people\r\nwanted it or not, that Spreckels and his associates organized their\r\ntraction company. It was shown that the object of the organizers of the\r\ncompany was to demonstrate that the conduit system was practical for San\r\nFrancisco. And, finally, the articles of incorporation under which the\r\ncompany proposed to operate, provided for the transfer under equitable\r\narrangements of the proposed new lines to the city, should the city wish\r\nat any time to take them over. Mr. Spreckels and his associates were\r\nshown not to have had desire or inclination to engage in the street-car\r\nbusiness. But it was shown that they proposed to fight for what they\r\nconsidered the best interests of the city of their birth and residence.\r\n\r\nAnother frequently-made charge had been that Heney was the attorney for\r\nRudolph Spreckels, directing a privately-conducted prosecution.[435] As\r\na matter of fact, Langdon, and not Heney, headed the prosecution, and\r\nLangdon let it be known at all times that he was the final arbitrator in\r\nall questions growing out of the prosecution. And at no time did he fail\r\nto assert himself. But at the Calhoun trial, the fishing expeditions in\r\nwhich the defense indulged, brought the facts out convincingly that\r\nHeney, far from being in Spreckels' employ, or directly or indirectly\r\nreceiving money from him for graft-prosecution services, or any other\r\nservices, was giving his time to the city, without reward or hope of\r\nreward.\r\n\r\nThus, point by point, the allegations which the graft defense had for\r\nthree years been making against the prosecution, were shown to be\r\nwithout foundation in fact. The bars were down, as Heney put it. Rudolph\r\nSpreckels and others who had made the prosecution possible, were under\r\noath, and were prepared to answer any question that might be put to\r\nthem. The ablest lawyers, cunning in cross-examination, selected,\r\nindeed, for their craft and skill in searching out the innermost secrets\r\nof witnesses, were there to question.\r\n\r\nBut not one statement reflecting upon the purposes of the prosecution,\r\nnor of its motives, nor of its methods, was brought out. The graft\r\ndefense, free to question as it would, was unable to justify the\r\ninsinuations of baseness of purpose and method; nor to justify its\r\nloosely-made charges against the prosecution.[436]\r\n\r\nIndeed, the attorneys for Mr. Calhoun even resisted full discussion of\r\nMr. Spreckels' motives.\r\n\r\nThe intimation, so broad as to approach positive declaration, had been\r\nmade repeatedly that Mr. Spreckels had inaugurated the graft prosecution\r\nfor the purpose of injuring Mr. Calhoun and the properties which he\r\nrepresented--the United Railroads. On re-direct examination, Mr.\r\nSpreckels was asked by the attorney for the State whether, at the time\r\nhe had first discussed investigation of graft conditions in San\r\nFrancisco with Mr. Heney, he had had any idea of investigating Mr.\r\nCalhoun. Mr. Barrett, representing the defendant, strongly objected to\r\nthis line of questioning.[437]\r\n\r\nAfter a wrangle between the attorneys as to the matter of the witness's\r\nmotives, Spreckels was permitted to make a brief statement to the Court.\r\n\r\n\"My motives,\" he said, \"have been inquired into, and I have indicated to\r\nMr. Rogers (Calhoun's attorney) that as far as I am concerned the bars\r\nare absolutely down; I am willing to take the judgment of this community\r\nas to motives, as to my purposes and as to the truthfulness of my\r\nstatements made here.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Spreckels was finally permitted to answer the question. He answered\r\nin the negative.[438]\r\n\r\nThe defendant placed no witnesses on the stand. The explanation of their\r\npeculiar position which the United Railroads officials were looked upon\r\nto make when opportunity offered was not made. The denials which they\r\nhad for three years been indignantly making through the newspapers were\r\nnot stated under oath.[439]\r\n\r\nThe trial resulted in a disagreement. According to published statements,\r\npurporting to come from members of the jury, on the first ballot four\r\njurors stood for conviction, eight for acquittal; on the second, nine\r\nfor acquittal, three for conviction. On all the other ballots the jurors\r\nstood ten for acquittal and two for conviction.[440]\r\n\r\nImmediately after announcement of the verdict,[441] the District\r\nAttorney attempted to bring Calhoun to trial for the alleged offering of\r\na bribe to Supervisor John J. Furey. This the defense resisted. The\r\ncommunity was filled with the suggestion that the Calhoun jury, having\r\nfailed to agree, the costly graft trials should be brought to an\r\nend.[442]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Calhoun's second trial was begun. But before a jury could\r\nbe secured, Francis J. Heney had been defeated for election as District\r\nAttorney. This meant the breaking down of the graft prosecution. The\r\nDistrict Attorney consented to continuance of the case until the new\r\nadministration should take charge. The case was not pressed by Mr.\r\nLangdon's successor, and finally, with the other graft charges, was\r\ndismissed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [423] From January 12, 1909, to June 20, 1909.\r\n\r\n [424] Earl Rogers showed himself particularly clever at goading. His\r\n       ability in this line was shown to advantage also, at the trial\r\n       of Clarence Darrow, charged with jury fixing at Los Angeles,\r\n       whom Rogers defended. The Fresno Republican in comparing the\r\n       two cases said, in its issue of July 12, 1912: \"When Heney\r\n       tilted, as prosecutor against Earl Rogers as an apologist for\r\n       crime, he was the 'wild man of Borneo,' to the more staid and\r\n       polished members of the San Francisco bar. But now that\r\n       Fredericks and Ford, prosecutors of Los Angeles, lost their\r\n       tempers under the goadings of this same Rogers in the Darrow\r\n       case, nothing is said about the wild man of Borneo. Fredericks\r\n       and Ford, unlike Heney, are recognized as the socially elect\r\n       of the profession, but Heney in the wildest excitement of the\r\n       Calhoun trials, never tried to throw an ink bottle at Rogers,\r\n       as Ford tried to do the other day. Plainly, as a matter of\r\n       social etiquette, it depends upon whose ox Rogers gores.\"\r\n\r\n [425] See footnote 269.\r\n\r\n [426] The Chronicle, as early as July 10, 1907, punctured the theory\r\n       that the bribing of public servants is justifiable.\r\n\r\n       The Chronicle said: \"In the examination of a talesman in Judge\r\n       Lawlor's court on Monday an attorney for the defendant charged\r\n       with the crime of bribing city officials made the statement\r\n       that San Francisco is divided on the subject of punishing men\r\n       who have committed the offense named. He said: 'You know, of\r\n       course, that San Francisco is divided on this graft question.\r\n       Half in favor of the prosecution, and, say, half contrary\r\n       minded.' Possibly he believes that this is true, but there is\r\n       absolutely no foundation for the assumption. There is no\r\n       evidence on which to base such a statement, and it would not\r\n       have been made if there was any possibility of determining its\r\n       truth or falsity by some simple test.\r\n\r\n       \"It is doubtless true that there are plenty of men in this\r\n       community who regard the crime of bribery lightly, and are\r\n       ready to defend it on the ground that laxity in the conduct of\r\n       municipal affairs made it necessary to resort to it or abandon\r\n       all enterprise. But the great majority of citizens take the\r\n       sound view that both briber and bribed are equally guilty and\r\n       equally deserving of punishment, and utterly refuse to accept\r\n       the excuse that the corporations which have been\r\n       systematically debauching city officials were forced to that\r\n       course. They know that the eager desire to secure advantages\r\n       is at the bottom of the corrupt condition of our municipal\r\n       affairs, and they feel that unless examples can be made of\r\n       those who have shown a willingness to profit by the greed and\r\n       turpitude of those elected to office the practice of bribing\r\n       will be again resumed and continued as long as there is\r\n       anything to be gained by the pursuit of criminal methods.\r\n\r\n       \"Even if it were true that the community is evenly divided it\r\n       would be outrageous to plead that fact as a justification for\r\n       the commission of criminal acts. If San Francisco should be so\r\n       lost to shame that nine-tenths of her population regarded\r\n       bribery with tolerance, it would be no less a crime, but there\r\n       would be infinitely more reason for striving to punish\r\n       offenders of that character to save the city from the moral\r\n       degradation involved in the acceptance of the idea that it is\r\n       excusable to defy the laws by debauching public officials.\"\r\n\r\n       At the time of Calhoun's trial, however, The Chronicle read\r\n       talesmen who sided with the defense no such lecture.\r\n\r\n [427] See Chapter XV, \"The Ford Trials.\"\r\n\r\n [428] The trolley-permit was granted May 21, 1906.\r\n\r\n [429] The letter placing $200,000 to Calhoun's credit read as\r\n       follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Treasury Department, Washington, May 22, 1906.

The\r\n       Chronicle of May 14, 1907, printed as part of Ford's statement\r\n       why he did not testify before the Grand Jury, the following:\r\n\r\n       \"The private interests that are behind this attack upon the\r\n       officers of the United Railroads have free access to this\r\n       juryroom through their chosen counsel who has assumed to\r\n       exercise all the official authority of the District Attorney\r\n       of this city and who, by reason of the exercise of such\r\n       authority, has become the legal counsellor and guide of this\r\n       Grand Jury.\r\n\r\n       \"The officers of the United Railroads are not unmindful of the\r\n       tremendous power for harm that lies in this unusual and\r\n       extraordinary situation.\r\n\r\n       \"They, therefore, protest against the consideration by this\r\n       Grand Jury of any evidence whose legality and sufficiency\r\n       cannot be judicially determined from a full, complete and\r\n       correct transcript thereof.\r\n\r\n       \"Second--The subpoena by which my attendance here was compelled\r\n       was not only insufficient in both form and substance, but was\r\n       served by a privately employed detective who is not a citizen\r\n       of California and who is employed and paid by private interests\r\n       notoriously hostile to the United Railroads.\r\n\r\n       \"Third--There is here present a person not permitted by the\r\n       laws of this State to be present, namely, an attorney nominally\r\n       representing the office of the District Attorney, while, in\r\n       fact, representing private interests in no manner connected\r\n       officially with any of the governmental affairs of this city\r\n       and State.\r\n\r\n       \"Fourth--I am the general counsel and legal adviser of the\r\n       United Railroads and its officers, and whatever knowledge I\r\n       possess of any of the affairs of the United Railroads or of its\r\n       officers, has come to me in professional confidence and, under\r\n       the law of this State, every attorney is compelled to keep\r\n       inviolate, and at every peril to himself, preserve the secrets\r\n       of his clients.\r\n\r\n       \"Fifth--Under the statement of the representative of the\r\n       District Attorney's office in attendance before this Grand\r\n       Jury, I feel it my duty to stand with the officers of the\r\n       United Railroads upon my constitutional rights, and the\r\n       District Attorney knows that he cannot in these proceedings\r\n       compel me to testify, and he also knows that no unfavorable\r\n       inference is permitted to be drawn from our declination in this\r\n       regard.\"\r\n\r\n [436] One of the most complete answers to the charges scattered\r\n       nation-wide by the Graft Defense, came from Dean John H.\r\n       Wigmore of the Northwestern School of Law at Chicago, author\r\n       of Wigmore on Evidence, (See footnote 283.)\r\n\r\n [437] See transcript of testimony, The People vs. Patrick Calhoun,\r\n       No. 1436, page 3723.\r\n\r\n [438] Mr. Spreckels finally testified on this point as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Heney. Q. At the time that Mr. Phelan agreed to\r\n       contribute the $10,000, Mr. Spreckels, what did you say, if\r\n       anything, about contributing yourself? A. That was in the\r\n       first meeting. I think, Mr. Heney, and I told him that I was\r\n       ready and willing to contribute a similar amount; that I\r\n       believed it would be possible to get others to join and\r\n       contribute.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. At that time was anything said by any person about\r\n       prosecuting Mr. Calhoun? A. Absolutely no.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Or any person connected with the United Railroads Company?\r\n       A. The discussion was entirely confined to the administration,\r\n       the corrupt administration as we termed it.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. At that time did you have any purpose or intention of\r\n       prosecuting Mr. Calhoun? A. I had not.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Did you have any reason to believe that Mr. Calhoun at that\r\n       time had committed any crime? A. I had no indication of such a\r\n       crime.\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Moore. Was that time fixed, Mr. Heney?\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Heney. Yes, it was fixed; the first conversation, and he\r\n       has fixed it as nearly as he could.\r\n\r\n       \"The Court. Have you in mind the testimony on that point, Mr.\r\n       Moore? There was some reference to it in an earlier part of the\r\n       examination.\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Heney. Q. When you had the talk with Mr. Heney in April,\r\n       1906, did you say anything about prosecuting Mr. Calhoun, or\r\n       anybody connected with the United Railroads? A. I did not.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Did you at any time tell Mr. Heney, that you desired to\r\n       have him prosecute Mr. Patrick Calhoun? A. I did not, at any\r\n       time.\r\n\r\n       \"Q. Did you tell him at any time that you desired to have him\r\n       prosecute any person connected with the United Railroads\r\n       Company? A. I did not.\"\r\n\r\n [439] The Chronicle in its issue of March 19, 1907, the day after\r\n       the story of corruption of Supervisors was made public, refers to\r\n       the denials of United Railroads officials as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Weeks ago, when the first charges of a corruption fund was\r\n       published, Patrick Calhoun issued from his New York offices a\r\n       typewritten statement, equivalent to about three-fourths of a\r\n       Chronicle column, in which he announced:\r\n\r\n       \"'I have just seen the San Francisco papers, in which vague\r\n       charges are made that the United Railroads of San Francisco\r\n       paid or caused to be paid $700,000 for a permit to use\r\n       electricity on the roads that it formerly operated with cable.\r\n       There is no foundation for this rumor. The United Railroads of\r\n       San Francisco never paid or authorized any one to pay on its\r\n       behalf a single dollar to the Mayor, Supervisors or any public\r\n       official of the city of San Francisco or the State of\r\n       California.'\r\n\r\n       \"Late last night the following additional denial was issued\r\n       from the office of the United Railroads:\r\n\r\n       \"'I am authorized to state in the most positive way that\r\n       neither Mr. Calhoun nor any officer of the United Railroads\r\n       ever paid or authorized anyone to pay one dollar to any\r\n       official.\r\n                                             'THORNWELL MULLALLY,\r\n                    'Assistant to the President United Railroads.'\"\r\n\r\n [440] The following statement was published over the name of Otto T.\r\n       Hildebrecht, one of the two jurors who had voted to convict:\r\n\r\n       \"As soon as we entered the jury room, I overheard a crowd of\r\n       the jurors in the rear of the hall shouting 'Acquit! Acquit!'\r\n       We then proceeded to name a foreman. This matter disposed of,\r\n       the members began balloting.\r\n\r\n       \"In the first half hour three ballots were cast. On the first\r\n       vote it stood 8 to 4 for acquittal. On the second ballot\r\n       Maguire succumbed to the pressure. I called upon him for his\r\n       reasons for changing his vote and he replied: 'Oh, these\r\n       corrupt conditions have always prevailed in San Francisco. The\r\n       Supervisors in this case are no different from the other men,\r\n       who have filled those offices. It will always be like that.'\r\n       To combat this attitude on Maguire's part, I stated, 'Well, it\r\n       is time to stamp out the crimes in this, city. In order that\r\n       the evil may be corrected we must put a stop to it.' This\r\n       seemed to have no weight with Maguire.\r\n\r\n       \"The next ballot showed that Anthes had gone over to the\r\n       others. From him I secured this information: 'Oh, why I always\r\n       vote with the majority.' I said, 'Why, how can an honest man\r\n       take that view of the matter?' I have taken an oath and at that\r\n       time announced that I would try this case solely on the\r\n       evidence.\r\n\r\n       \"It is plainly pointed out in the testimony of Sanderson that\r\n       Calhoun was present when Ruef said, 'This thing will go through\r\n       on Monday. It is all settled.' This produced no impression upon\r\n       the others, although I argued that such testimony alone proved\r\n       Calhoun's guilty knowledge of the plan to put the deal through\r\n       when he remarked in answer to Sanderson's query, 'Then you\r\n       won't need me?' 'I don't think we do.'\r\n\r\n       \"I then asked the other jurors to come into court, they\r\n       contending that Ruef had carried on the conversation with\r\n       Sanderson and that Calhoun was an innocent witness. We asked to\r\n       have this testimony revealed and the jurors filed into court.\r\n       Upon returning to the jury room we renewed our deliberations.\r\n\r\n       \"The other ten jurors came at Binner and myself and sought to\r\n       induce me to stretch my imagination to the end that Calhoun had\r\n       paid the money to Ruef, but only as a fee. They acknowledged\r\n       right there that Calhoun had paid over the money but they\r\n       argued that he didn't know that the money was going to be used\r\n       as a bribe to the Supervisors,--only as a fee to Ruef. After\r\n       that I knew that these men had purposely taken the wrong view\r\n       of the whole matter. I had called them to account for the\r\n       remarks that the testimony throughout the case was all\r\n       purchased and that Heney had held the whip over the\r\n       Supervisors. Thereupon they backed down on that stand and made\r\n       their whole plea on the ground that Calhoun had given the\r\n       trolley money to Ruef as a fee.\r\n\r\n       \"I disagreed on the ground that Heney, Spreckels and the other\r\n       members of the prosecution were not on trial as they insisted,\r\n       and that the other matters, such as the theft of reports and\r\n       suppression of testimony, had only been touched upon during the\r\n       trial to prove that Calhoun knew that the bribery deal had been\r\n       carried through.\r\n\r\n       \"'Can't you give Calhoun the benefit of the doubt, that he paid\r\n       this money as a fee?' was the burden of the others' argument.\r\n       'I would be willing to extend him every chance,' I replied,\r\n       'but why has he not introduced these vouchers of the United\r\n       Railroads in court, then we might see what was paid to bribe\r\n       the juries in the Ford trials.' After this they dropped me like\r\n       a red-hot stove. I seemed to have struck home. It was a\r\n       terrifying ordeal to stand off these ten men for twelve hours,\r\n       but I held firmly to my course and voted throughout upon my\r\n       conscience. I should have been ashamed to have lifted my head\r\n       in the future had I fallen down and voted for an acquittal.\r\n       When the deputy, Mr. Coyle, called to convey the word to Judge\r\n       Lawlor as to the clearness of an agreement being reached, I met\r\n       him at the door that night. 'We shall never reach an\r\n       agreement,' I replied, 'unless these men come over to my side.\r\n       That I fear shall never come to pass.' The claim has been made\r\n       in the Globe that I asked for a secret ballot. That is an\r\n       untruth, as is the statement that I am a Socialist. Not that I\r\n       am opposed to Socialism, but I have never been inclined to\r\n       their views. Our political outlooks differ. When I told Coyle\r\n       that there was no chance of a verdict being reached, the other\r\n       jurors, one of those standing alongside of me, punched me in\r\n       the ribs in an effort to make me shut up, as they figured that\r\n       they ought to be able to convince me. I have received letters\r\n       from all over the State; friends and acquaintances, even utter\r\n       strangers, congratulating me upon my stand in the Calhoun case\r\n       and my vote for conviction.\"\r\n\r\n [441] Calhoun, after the disagreement of the jury that tried him,\r\n       issued a statement to the press in which he bitterly denounced\r\n       those who were responsible for the prosecution, and hinted at\r\n       retaliation. He continued to insist that Heney was a corrupt\r\n       official: \"There lies in the courtroom,\" said Calhoun, \"forty\r\n       checks made by Mr. Rudolph Spreckels to Mr. Francis J. Heney\r\n       since his alleged appointment as Assistant District Attorney.\r\n       Those checks were deposited in the American National Bank to\r\n       his private account. They aggregate $23,800. The first of them\r\n       amounted to $4,900. They are the price of his infamy. He can\r\n       not escape the fact that he is a corrupt public official by\r\n       the contention that he has been engaged in a holy crusade. He\r\n       can not defend the acceptance of money from a private citizen\r\n       for the express purpose of enabling him to devote himself\r\n       exclusively to the so-called Graft Prosecution without\r\n       committing the crime of accepting a bribe. I here make the\r\n       formal and specific charge that Francis J. Heney stands side\r\n       by side with James L. Gallagher as a corrupt public official.\r\n       I charge him with having accepted bribes and I also charge\r\n       Rudolph Spreckels and James D. Phelan with having given him\r\n       the bribes; and if we can get a fair District Attorney in the\r\n       city of San Francisco I propose at the proper time and in the\r\n       proper way to submit formal charges against Heney for having\r\n       received bribes and Spreckels and Phelan for having paid\r\n       them.\"\r\n\r\n       Of Calhoun's threat of prosecution, The Call in its issue of\r\n       June 22, 1909, said:\r\n\r\n       \"In that soiled and motley retinue of strikers and heelers,\r\n       jury fixers and gaspipe men that the head of the United\r\n       Railroads has gathered about him were many who made it a\r\n       business to proclaim that when the indictments came to the test\r\n       of fact in court the disposition of that $200,000 would be\r\n       explained as a perfectly innocent matter in the simplest\r\n       possible manner. How these promises have been fulfilled we\r\n       know. The mystery of that $200,000 remains as dark as ever. Not\r\n       even the stockholders of the company are invited into the\r\n       confidence of its president. It is not now the question, Where\r\n       did he get it? but What did he do with it?\r\n\r\n       \"As long as that question remains unanswered by or for Calhoun\r\n       and as long as he refuses to undergo cross examination and the\r\n       ordinary legal tests of proof, just so long will the whole\r\n       American public believe him guilty of bribery. As for his\r\n       threat of some sort of vague legal proceedings against the\r\n       prosecutors, that will merely provoke a laugh, as men do laugh\r\n       at a cheap and obvious bluff.\"\r\n\r\n [442] The free press, not only of California but of the entire\r\n       nation, protested against such a course. \"San Francisco,\" said\r\n       the Pittsburgh Times-Gazette, \"owes it to the nation to\r\n       continue her fight against the big grafters of that town. If\r\n       she lets up now the grafters the country over will take heart,\r\n       and the next time it becomes necessary to go after the tribe,\r\n       it will be more difficult even than it has been in San\r\n       Francisco to convict a briber.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n                   THE SAN FRANCISCO ELECTION OF 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\nScarcely had the disagreeing jury in the Calhoun case been discharged\r\nthan the Graft Prosecution was again called upon to meet the graft\r\ndefense at the polls. Langdon's second term was to expire the following\r\nJanuary. His successor was to be elected in November.\r\n\r\nMr. Langdon refused positively to be a candidate to succeed himself. The\r\nsupporters of the prosecution turned to Heney as the most available\r\ncandidate to oppose the elements united against them.\r\n\r\nHeney did not want to be a candidate. The grueling contest of the\r\nCalhoun trial, coupled with the nerve-shattering effects of the wound in\r\nhis head, had brought him to the point of physical and nervous\r\nbreakdown. But it was demonstrated to him that he had the largest\r\npersonal following in San Francisco; that the public had confidence in\r\nhim; that he must make the fight.\r\n\r\nAnd Heney, doubtful of his physical ability to continue to the end of\r\nthe primary and final campaigns, consented to become a candidate.\r\n\r\nThere followed the most astonishing campaign for municipal office ever\r\nheld in San Francisco, or probably in any other American city.\r\n\r\nCalifornia was at the time groping her way from the clutch of the\r\nSouthern Pacific \"machine.\" The California Legislature of 1909 had\r\nadjourned after a session which had ended largely in disappointing\r\nfailure for the anti-machine element. The anti-machine element had been\r\nin slight majority, but it had blunderingly permitted the machine\r\nminority to organize both houses. As a result, the \"machine\" had been\r\nable to defeat the passage of many anti-machine--now known as\r\nprogressive--measures. In other instances progressive measures were\r\nbefore their passage,[443] in the face of the earnest but unavailable\r\nprotest of the well-intentioned but unorganized anti-machine majority,\r\nloaded with hampering amendments.\r\n\r\nTwo of these measures bore directly upon the San Francisco situation.\r\nThe first measure provided for the Direct Primary. The second provided\r\nfor the elimination of the \"party circle\" from the election ballot.\r\n\r\nThis last named measure, known as \"the Party Circle bill,\" passed the\r\nSenate, but was defeated by one vote in the Assembly. The defeated\r\nmeasure was intended to restore the Australian ballot to its original\r\nsimplicity and effectiveness.[444]\r\n\r\nUnder the machine's tinkering of the State's election laws, the\r\nAustralian ballot had become a device for encouraging partisan voting.\r\nThe \"party circle\" was placed at the head of the column of party\r\ncandidates. A cross placed in the circle registered a vote for every\r\ncandidate nominated by the party designated by the circle. The question\r\nof \"distinguishing marks\" invalidating entire ballots was ruled upon so\r\nclosely by the State courts, that many voters voted by means of the one\r\ncross in the party circle to avoid the risk of having their entire\r\nballot denied counting because of technical defects that might creep in\r\nif a divided ticket were voted. Had the \"Party Circle bill\" become a law\r\nit would have eliminated the \"party circle\" from the ballot, leaving the\r\nvoter to select individual candidates of his choice. The one Assembly\r\nvote that defeated this measure after it had passed the Senate, went far\r\ntoward bringing the San Francisco Graft Prosecution to an end.\r\n\r\nThe Direct Primary measure was not defeated, nor did the machine element\r\nsucceed in amending it into complete ineffectiveness. The anti-machine\r\nRepublicans and Democrats, by joining in non-partisan caucus on this\r\nmeasure, succeeded in forcing the passage of the Direct Primary bill,\r\nbut they were not able to keep it free of defects. Harassed by the\r\nmachine at every turn, the anti-machine Senators and Assemblymen were\r\ncompelled to accept many undesirable provisions.[445]\r\n\r\nOne of these provisions bore directly upon the San Francisco election of\r\n1909, and contributed to a large extent to the outcome.\r\n\r\nThis clause required a primary candidate to make affidavit giving \"the\r\nname of his party and that of the office for which he desires to be a\r\ncandidate; that he affiliated with said party at the last preceding\r\ngeneral election, and either that he did not vote thereat or voted for a\r\nmajority of the candidates of said party at said next preceding general\r\nelection, and intends to so vote at the ensuing election.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time this section was under consideration, anti-machine\r\nlegislators and the unhampered press pointed out that under it, District\r\nAttorney Langdon could not, in all probability, have been nominated nor\r\nre-elected in 1907; that Mayor Taylor's election of that year would have\r\nbeen impracticable, if not impossible; that Judge Dunne would have been\r\nhampered to the point of defeat in 1908; that under it, both in 1907 and\r\n1908, the so-called \"higher-up\" element in the field of corruption would\r\nhave been given an advantage which the better citizenship of the\r\ncommunity would have had difficulty in overcoming.[446]\r\n\r\nBut the machine element denounced these not unreasonable objectors as\r\n\"enemies of the Direct Primary bill,\" and under cover of the\r\ndenunciation, and the fight for practical expression of popular choice\r\nfor United States Senators, the objectionable clause was permitted to\r\nremain in the bill.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the Legislature adjourned than judicial interpretation of\r\nthe partisan clause of the Direct Primary Act became necessary. The San\r\nFrancisco primary election was at hand, and the partisan provisions of\r\nthe new law proved the first snag which the various candidates\r\nencountered.\r\n\r\nAlthough the members of the Legislature, machine as well as\r\nanti-machine, voted for the bill, believing that the partisan clause\r\nrestricted primary nominations to members of the party of the\r\ncandidates' affiliation, the San Francisco Election Commissioners held\r\nthere was nothing in the law to prevent the name of a Republican\r\nappearing on the Democratic ticket, or of a Democrat on the Republican\r\nticket, provided the candidate made affidavit of the party of his\r\naffiliation.\r\n\r\nUnder this ruling it appeared that, in spite of the objectionable\r\npartisan provision of the Direct Primary law, the San Francisco election\r\ncould be held on the non-partisan basis which had resulted in the\r\nelection of Taylor and Langdon two years before. The one issue before\r\nthe San Francisco electors was continuance of the Graft Prosecution. The\r\nsupporters of the prosecution, Republicans as well as Democrats, desired\r\nto vote for Heney. McCarthy was the avowed Labor Union party candidate\r\nfor Mayor. The Union Labor party was considering the nomination for\r\nDistrict Attorney of Charles M. Fickert. The prospects were good that\r\nHeney would receive the Republican and Democratic nominations, as\r\nLangdon had two years before. He was supported by the better element of\r\nboth parties, and opposed by the anti-prosecution element of both. This\r\nopposition found expression in the Republican party in a committee of\r\ntwenty-five, at the head of which was I. W. Hellman, Jr., of the Union\r\nTrust Company.[447] The better element of the party planned the\r\nnomination of Heney, as did the better element of Democrats.\r\n\r\nOn a non-partisan basis, such as had prevailed in 1907, the Union Labor\r\nparty would have nominated McCarthy for Mayor, and Fickert for District\r\nAttorney, while the anti-machine, pro-prosecution Democrats and\r\nRepublicans would have nominated a strong candidate for Mayor, and Heney\r\nfor District Attorney.\r\n\r\nConditions were thus shaping themselves admirably for continuance of the\r\nnon-partisan administration of municipal affairs, which had at least\r\nblocked corruption, even though it had not beaten down the barriers of\r\ntechnicality, which stood between the corruptors of the municipal\r\ngovernment and law-provided penalties.\r\n\r\nBut this developing non-partisan arrangement was suddenly overturned in\r\nan opinion rendered by the Supreme Court, reversing the ruling of the\r\nElection Commissioners.\r\n\r\nThe court held that the partisan provisions of the Direct Primary law\r\nprohibited the name of a primary candidate appearing upon any primary\r\nticket except that of the party of the candidate's affiliations.\r\n\r\nUnder this ruling, Fickert's name could not go on the Union Labor party\r\nprimary ticket, for Fickert had affiliated with the Republican party.\r\nThe Hellman committee of twenty-five (Republican) immediately took up\r\nthe Union Labor party candidate for District Attorney, whose name could\r\nnot go on the Union Labor party primary ticket, Mr. Fickert being\r\napparently quite as satisfactory to Mr. Hellman and his associates as he\r\nwas to Mr. McCarthy.\r\n\r\nHeney, under the Supreme Court's ruling, found himself in a more\r\ndifficult position. With other California Progressives, Heney had in\r\n1908 supported Taft for the Presidency. His political affiliations were\r\ntherefore, under the provisions of the Direct Primary law, Republican.\r\nHis name could be placed on the Republican primary ticket, but not on\r\nthe Democratic. But it soon became evident that if his name went on the\r\nRepublican ticket he would be defeated at the primaries.\r\n\r\nThe registration of voters under their party designation to enable them\r\nto vote at the partisan primaries showed an astonishing condition. The\r\nmachine, anti-prosecution element was discovered to be massing its\r\nstrength in the Republican party. Two years before, Daniel A. Ryan, the\r\nRepublican candidate for Mayor, had received only 9255 votes in San\r\nFrancisco, while Taylor, the Democratic candidate, had received 28,766,\r\nand McCarthy, Union Labor, 17,583. But for the 1909 primaries, no less\r\nthan 47,945 registered as Republicans, a gain of 38,609 over Ryan's\r\nvote,[448] while the Democratic registration was 17,632 only, 11,134\r\nless than Taylor's vote, and the Union Labor registration, 10,546, or\r\n7037 less than McCarthy's vote in 1907. Heney's name could not go on the\r\nDemocratic ballot. If he permitted it to go on the Republican ballot,\r\nthe tremendous Republican registration indicated that the anti-machine\r\nRepublicans would be outvoted by \"machine\" members of all parties who\r\nhad registered as Republicans.\r\n\r\nBy another provision of the election laws, Heney, should he be defeated\r\nat the primaries, could not become an independent candidate; defeat at\r\nthe primaries barred him from running at the final election.\r\n\r\nHeney was effectively shut out from participating as a primary\r\ncandidate. And this, in face of the fact that the anti-machine\r\nRepublicans and the anti-machine Democrats were striving to make him\r\ntheir candidate.\r\n\r\nHad the 1909 primary law prevailed in 1907, Langdon's re-election could\r\nhave been, and almost to a certainty would have been blocked, and the\r\nGraft Prosecution brought to an end two years before it was.\r\n\r\nAt the 1909 Primary election, Heney's name, although he was the choice\r\nof the anti-machine element of all parties, did not appear on any of the\r\nprimary ballots.[449] Nevertheless, 4594 Republicans wrote Heney's name\r\non their primary ballots. But this was not sufficient to give him the\r\nnomination. Fickert, whose name appeared on the Republican ballot, as a\r\nregular candidate, received 12,480 votes, which gave him the Republican\r\nnomination.\r\n\r\nOn neither the Democratic nor Union Labor primary tickets did the name\r\nof any candidate for District Attorney appear. The McCarthy element\r\nurged that Fickert's name be written in by Union Labor party voters.\r\nThey carried their point, Fickert being nominated by the Union Labor\r\nparty by 3308 votes. But even here there was registered protest at what\r\nwas going on. Union Labor party voters to the number of 617 wrote\r\nHeney's name on their ballots.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, a determined effort was made to give Fickert the\r\nDemocratic nomination also. He received 2298 votes. But the\r\npro-prosecution Democrats rallied to Heney's support, and nominated him\r\nby a vote of 2386. Thus out of a total of 28,967 who voted for\r\nnomination of District Attorney, no less than 7597, or more than 25 per\r\ncent., wrote Heney's name on their ballots, in protest against the\r\npartisan conditions which made his regular nomination impractical.\r\n\r\nThe law was new; the election, the first held in the State under the\r\nDirect Primary. It was difficult to make the electors understand they\r\ncould vote to nominate Heney by writing his name on the ballot. Of the\r\n38,385 who voted at the primaries only 28,967 voted for District\r\nAttorney. Unquestionably, a large percentage of those who did not vote\r\nat all, would have written Heney's name on the ballot had they known\r\nthat such a course was permissible. But they did not know, and more than\r\n25 per cent. of those voting did not vote for District Attorney. As the\r\nRev. Charles N. Lathrop put it: \"They have Heney sewed up in a bag, and\r\nthe bag is the partisan features of the Direct Primary.\"[450]\r\n\r\nOut of this confusing primary election, Fickert came with two party\r\nnominations, the Union Labor and the Republican, while Heney had one\r\nnomination, the Democratic. This meant that Fickert's name would be\r\nprinted twice on the final ballot under partisan designation, while\r\nHeney's would be printed but once. Thus, for every chance Heney had for\r\na \"party circle\" vote Fickert had two.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution forces had supported Byron Mauzy for Republican\r\nnomination for Mayor, but Mr. Mauzy[451] was defeated by William\r\nCrocker, who received the Republican nomination. The Democrats nominated\r\nThomas B. W. Leland for the mayoralty office, while the Union Labor\r\nparty named P. H. McCarthy. The mayoralty-district attorney tickets\r\nwere, therefore: Republican, Crocker and Fickert; Union Labor, McCarthy\r\nand Fickert; Democratic, Leland and Heney. But the issue before San\r\nFrancisco, continuance of the Graft Prosecution, had no partisan\r\nsignificance at all. It was supported and it was opposed by members of\r\nboth parties. The whole fight was over the election of Heney. But never\r\nhad candidate for office opposition which had more at stake.[452]\r\n\r\nMen with apparently unlimited means at their disposal, realized that\r\nHeney's election would in all probability mean for them a term in the\r\nState prison. They were fighting for their liberty. The commercial\r\ninterests were warned that, in the words of I. W. Hellman, Sr., the\r\nbanker, the Graft Prosecution was hurting business.[453] The anti-Graft\r\nProsecution press insisted day after day that bribery of public\r\nofficials, while bad, is the most common of crimes and the most\r\ndifficult to prove; that San Francisco had tried to convict, had failed\r\nand might as well give up. So-called \"improvement clubs\" went so far as\r\nto adopt resolutions not only protesting against further prosecution,\r\nbut demanding that the Supervisors withdraw support given the District\r\nAttorney's office in its efforts to land bribe-givers behind the\r\nbars.[454] And finally, the large business interests opposed to the\r\nprosecution, threw strength to McCarthy; not that they liked\r\nMcCarthy--they united against him two years later--but because the\r\nelection of McCarthy would go far toward the defeat of Heney. Members of\r\nthe labor unions were, to a large extent, supporters of the prosecution.\r\nTheir votes had made Langdon's election sure in 1907. During the 1909\r\ncampaign, and down to the very day of election, the sentiment among\r\nlaboring men was to vote for McCarthy and Heney. But Heney's name did\r\nnot appear on the Union Labor ticket.\r\n\r\nLabor's support of Heney was vigorously opposed. Appeal was made to\r\nworkingmen to stay by their class; to vote for the labor candidates,\r\nMcCarthy and Fickert. On the Monday night before the election, the\r\nwriter, with Professor George H. Boke of the University of California\r\nLaw School, joined a group of working men who were discussing the merits\r\nof the several candidates. Apparently all but one of them were for\r\nMcCarthy and Heney. The exception was for Leland and Heney. He was\r\ndefending himself, when the writer joined the group, against the charge\r\nthat in voting for Leland he was \"voting outside his class.\"\r\n\r\nThis Leland advocate was a most noticeable young man. He declared\r\nhimself to be a member of the electricians' union. Well under thirty,\r\nclear-eyed and forceful, he was prepared to stand his ground. When his\r\nimmediate opponent became personal, the electrical worker, without\r\nraising his voice, without excitement, or boast, or display, remarked\r\nquietly: \"Do not resort to personalities, for if it comes to\r\npersonalities, what chance have you against me?\"\r\n\r\nThere were no more personalities.\r\n\r\nIncidentally his argument was fast bringing out the fact that every\r\nworker in the crowd was going to vote for Heney. The effect of it was\r\nimportant. Suddenly from somewhere there appeared a new man to do his\r\npart in molding public opinion.\r\n\r\nThe new-comer went through that crowd with the assurance of a practiced\r\nfootball player through an aggregation of amateurs. In less than five\r\nminutes he had addressed every man of the group. But he had none of the\r\nmarks of a worker, and nobody thought to ask for his \"card.\" His was the\r\npasty face and the pudgy neck and the soft, unclean hand of the cadet.\r\nHis argument was curious and even ridiculous, but it was most effective.\r\nIt at least scattered the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"Of course Calhoun is a grafter,\" he said in effect. \"They are all\r\ngrafters. Spreckels is a grafter. Of course, Fickert is Calhoun's man,\r\njust as Heney is Spreckels's man. They are all out for graft. But if we\r\nare to have grafting, let's keep the graft in our own class. Why should\r\nyou vote to let Spreckels's men do the grafting? You have a candidate of\r\nyour own. Vote for him. It is only a fight between millionaires anyhow,\r\nand a toss-up which is right. Let us vote for the man of our class.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of this running fire of words was immediate. The electrician\r\nlost the attention of his associates. The discussion came to an end with\r\nmurmurs of approval of the newcomer's position. That he should have\r\nchanged a vote with such argument seems incredible. But that he had\r\ncreated a doubt in the minds of those workingmen was apparent to all who\r\nsaw. He left them well prepared for the anti-prosecution workers who\r\nwould meet them at the polls the next morning.\r\n\r\nBut the laboring element was not the only \"class\" forced into opposition\r\nto Heney. At the exclusive clubs, fashionable hotels, social functions,\r\nsupport of Heney was denounced as treason to the exclusive, fashionable,\r\nsocial class. It was quite amusing to hear first generation descendants\r\nof honest steerage immigrants decrying the prosecution of rich men\r\ntrapped in bribe-giving on the theory that to do otherwise \"would be\r\ntreason to our class.\"\r\n\r\nThus, Mr. Heney was called upon to meet the \"class\" opposition of the\r\nlaborer and the magnate. On the other hand, the unafraid, intelligent\r\npeople of San Francisco, who recognized no \"class\" issue, rallied to\r\nHeney's support. But they were without the concerted plan of action\r\nwhich the other side had perfected. The San Francisco press, with the\r\nexception of The Bulletin and Daily News, gave Heney no editorial\r\nsupport, but the country press, which had no circulation in San\r\nFrancisco, earnestly urged his election.[455]\r\n\r\nGood citizens throughout the country wrote urging Heney's election. \"To\r\nrout the forces of the prosecution at this juncture in San Francisco,\"\r\nwrote Rabbi Stephen S. Wise of New York, \"is to hoist the red flag of\r\nanarchy, to proclaim that law and order are not always enforceable, or\r\nthat such enforcement is not always profitable.\"\r\n\r\nBut Rabbi Wise was in New York. His influence did not, unfortunately,\r\nextend, in any important degree, to San Francisco.\r\n\r\nOn the day of election, the writer visited many voting places in the\r\ndistricts in which the labor vote was strong. Working men by the scores\r\nwere taking less than a minute to mark their ballots. It was evident\r\nthat they were voting by means of the party circle. Every Labor Union\r\nparty vote of this kind was a vote against Heney. The last hope that\r\nHeney would get this support was gone. One did not need wait for the\r\ncounting of the ballots. It was plain that Heney was defeated.\r\n\r\nThe election returns spoke eloquently of the means that had been\r\nemployed to defeat Heney. For the primary election 47,945 had registered\r\nas Republicans, but Crocker, the Republican candidate for Mayor,\r\nreceived only 13,766 votes at the final election. Although but 10,546\r\nhad registered for the primaries as members of the Union Labor party, P.\r\nH. McCarthy received 29,455 votes, which, wherever voting was done by\r\nmeans of the party circle, carried a vote for Fickert.\r\n\r\nFickert, with the two nominations, received 36,192. Heney, running on\r\nthe Democratic ticket, received 26,075 votes, 6481 more than Leland, the\r\ncandidate for Mayor. But the combination against Heney was too great for\r\nhim or any man to overcome. Fickert was elected.[456]\r\n\r\nThe Graft Prosecution had been defeated at the polls.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [443] See \"Story of the California Legislature of 1909,\" Chapters\r\n       VIII, IX, X, XI.\r\n\r\n [444] This reform was accomplished at the Legislative session of\r\n       1911. The undesirable provisions were also stricken by\r\n       amendment from the Direct Primary law. See \"Story of the\r\n       California Legislature of 1911.\"\r\n\r\n [445] \"Before voting on this matter,\" (the Direct Primary\r\n       provisions) said Senator Stetson, an anti-machine leader in\r\n       explaining his vote, \"lest any one in the future may think\r\n       that I have been passed something and didn't know it, I wish\r\n       to explain my vote, and wish to say that this permission\r\n       accorded a candidate to go on record to support that candidate\r\n       for United States Senate, who shall have the endorsement of\r\n       the greatest number of districts, comes from nobody and goes\r\n       to nobody. It means nothing--mere words--idle words. The only\r\n       way in which a candidate could have been pledged would have\r\n       been to provide a pledge or instructions to the Legislature.\r\n       The words 'shall be permitted' mean nothing and get nowhere. I\r\n       shall vote for this report, not because I want to, but because\r\n       I have to if we are at this session to have any Direct Primary\r\n       law at all.\"\r\n\r\n       Senator Stetson was referring particularly to the section\r\n       which denied the people by state-wide vote the right to\r\n       indicate their preference for United States Senator, but his\r\n       words would have applied as directly and as truly to other\r\n       sections of the measure.\r\n\r\n       Other good government Senators did, as a matter of fact,\r\n       denounce the very partisan clause which later contributed so\r\n       largely to Heney's defeat. Senators Campbell, Holohan and\r\n       Miller, for example, while voting for the bill, sent to the\r\n       clerk's desk the following explanation of their vote:\r\n\r\n       \"We voted for the Direct Primary bill because it seems to be\r\n       the best law that can be obtained under existing political\r\n       conditions. We are opposed to many of the features of this\r\n       bill, and believe that the people at the first opportunity will\r\n       instruct their representatives in the Legislature to radically\r\n       amend the same in many particulars, notably in regard to the\r\n       election of United States Senators, and the provisions that\r\n       prevent the endorsement of a candidate by a political party or\r\n       organization other than the one that first nominated such\r\n       candidate.\"\r\n\r\n [446] See files of Sacramento Bee for February and March, 1909, and\r\n       Senate Journal for March 22, 1909, page 1976.\r\n\r\n [447] The Union Trust Company loaned $175,000 to the Calkins'\r\n       Syndicate, which published papers in opposition to the\r\n       prosecution. For the curious circumstances under which the\r\n       loan was made, see footnote 275, page 257. The Union Trust\r\n       Company officials were among the most effective opponents of\r\n       the prosecution, and most persistent in circulating the story\r\n       that the prosecution hurt business. The head of the\r\n       institution, I. W. Hellman, Sr., returning early in August\r\n       from a trip to Europe, when the 1909 campaign was opening,\r\n       said in an interview, published in the Chronicle, August 4,\r\n       1909: \"In New York I found that there is still a great\r\n       difficulty in securing capital for San Francisco on account of\r\n       the Graft Prosecution, or the 'graft persecution,' as they\r\n       call it there. Of course, I do not know what changes have\r\n       occurred in the situation here since I left six months ago,\r\n       but I had an interview with certain people In New York and I\r\n       found that they were unwilling to send capital here as long as\r\n       this 'graft persecution' was continued.\"\r\n\r\n [448] Ryan did not receive his full party vote (see chapter XXI)\r\n       while Taylor received the anti-machine vote of all parties.\r\n       Nevertheless, this does not account for the extent of the\r\n       astonishing changes in registration.\r\n\r\n [449] It is interesting to note that the politicians responsible for\r\n       this condition, and who regarded Heney's position at the 1909\r\n       primaries with no attempt to conceal their amusement, were in\r\n       1912, loudest in their insistence that they had been\r\n       disfranchised because the names of Taft electors did not\r\n       appear on the California election ballot at the 1912 election.\r\n       It is also to be noted that their representations were based\r\n       on misrepresentation. They could, under the 1911 election\r\n       laws, had they had any intention of giving Taft genuine\r\n       support in California, have placed the names on the ballot by\r\n       petition, as was done in the case of the Roosevelt electors,\r\n       who, lest their regular nomination be questioned, were also\r\n       nominated by petition.\r\n\r\n [450] The California Legislature of 1911 corrected the features of\r\n       the election laws which blocked free expression of the will of\r\n       the electors. San Francisco, by amendment of its charter, has\r\n       since placed all municipal elections on a strictly\r\n       non-partisan basis, with provisions under which no candidate\r\n       can be elected by a plurality vote. It is interesting to note\r\n       that although opposed by Mayor McCarthy and the group of\r\n       politicians about him, these amendments correcting the\r\n       weaknesses of the election laws, were adopted overwhelmingly.\r\n       McCarthy's vote in 1911 was practically the same as the vote\r\n       by which he was elected in 1909. Had the election been held\r\n       under the same conditions in 1911, as in 1909, McCarthy would\r\n       almost to a certainty have been re-elected.\r\n\r\n [451] Mr. Mauzy had the active opposition of the anti-prosecution\r\n       element, which proposed that old sores be forgotten, and the\r\n       city be kept free of graft in the future.\r\n\r\n       \"If you think,\" said The Chronicle, on August 17, 1909, \"San\r\n       Francisco is suffering injury from the fruitless effort to\r\n       obtain convictions in cases in which evidence is lacking, vote\r\n       the Byron Mauzy ticket. If you believe that the sane thing to\r\n       do is to cease wasting money over the attempt to accomplish\r\n       the impossible, vote for candidates who can be depended upon\r\n       to give the city an administration from which graft will be\r\n       eliminated in future.\"\r\n\r\n [452] The platform expressions on the Graft Prosecution issue are\r\n       interesting. The Republican platform made no reference to it\r\n       at all. There was some talk of providing that \"the District\r\n       Attorney should do his duty,\" but not even this was provided.\r\n       The Union Labor party plank on this question read as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"We believe in the principle of the equality of all men before\r\n       the law; that every guilty person should be prosecuted with\r\n       vigor, in accordance with the law of the land, and that the\r\n       administration of the law should be free from any and all\r\n       suspicion of private control. We condemn favoritism or\r\n       leniency in behalf of any offender before the law, or any\r\n       compromise with criminals. We demand that any and all\r\n       offenders be dealt with alike, and to such end we pledge our\r\n       nominees.\"\r\n\r\n       The Democratic plank alone pledged support to the Graft\r\n       Prosecution. It read:\r\n\r\n       \"We pledge the Democratic party absolutely and unequivocally to\r\n       the support of the Graft Prosecution which for three years has\r\n       valiantly battled for the principle of the equality of all men\r\n       before the law, which has secured convictions against\r\n       disheartening odds and has paved the way for the clean\r\n       administration of public affairs which we now enjoy.\r\n\r\n       \"The people must declare at this critical election for or\r\n       against municipal corruption; for the enforcement of the law,\r\n       or for its abandonment; for or against not only a greater but a\r\n       better San Francisco.\r\n\r\n       \"Francis J. Heney, our candidate for District Attorney,\r\n       embodies these issues, and we pledge him the vigorous and loyal\r\n       support of the Democratic party.\"\r\n\r\n [453] The \"hurt business\" argument was ably combated by businessmen\r\n       who were free of the graft mire.\r\n\r\n       \"From all the available information at hand,\" said Colonel\r\n       Harris Weinstock, of the firm of Weinstock-Lubin & Co., in\r\n       replying to this argument, \"I find that on the whole the\r\n       volume of business is greater in San Francisco than it ever\r\n       was before. I am, therefore, unable to see how business has\r\n       been hurt by the Graft Prosecution.\r\n\r\n       \"The burden of proof on this point properly rests with those\r\n       making the charge. They should present facts and figures\r\n       verifying their statement that business has been hurt by the\r\n       graft prosecution before they can hope to have it accepted as\r\n       fact.\r\n\r\n       \"So far as I have been able to find out, the Graft Prosecution\r\n       has not hurt business, but even if it had seriously crippled\r\n       business it would still be your duty and my duty and the duty\r\n       of every lover and well-wisher of our free institutions to hold\r\n       up the hands of those who are fighting your battle and my\r\n       battle in an effort to bring public wrongdoers to justice, and\r\n       thus prevent harm from coming to the republic. Let the work go\r\n       on.\"\r\n\r\n       The American National Bank of San Francisco, in a financial\r\n       letter issued August 25, 1909, gave figures which disproved the\r\n       Hellman idea.\r\n\r\n       \"It is significant of San Francisco's credit standing in the\r\n       world at large,\" the letter read, \"that the bonds of this city\r\n       command prices that compare favorably with the issues of other\r\n       large municipalities, as measured by the low interest return\r\n       which investors are willing to accept. To illustrate: For every\r\n       $1,000 put into municipal bonds at present figures, the\r\n       purchaser would receive per annum:\r\n\r\n          \"From San Francisco bonds         $39.00\r\n          \"From Philadelphia bonds           37.00\r\n          \"From Cincinnati bonds             37.50\r\n          \"From Cleveland bonds              37.50\r\n          \"From St. Louis bonds              38.80\r\n          \"From Pittsburg bonds              37.00\r\n          \"From Chicago bonds                38.50\r\n          \"From Minneapolis bonds            38.50\r\n          \"From Milwaukee bonds              39.00\r\n          \"From New York bonds               39.50\r\n\r\n       \"Considering these facts, and the readiness with which the San\r\n       Francisco bonds are being taken, it does not appear that this\r\n       city is suffering in reputation, as some people affect to\r\n       believe, by reason of certain trials which have engaged the\r\n       attention of the criminal courts for two years past.\"\r\n\r\n       \"I have no patience,\" said Heney, in discussing the Hellman\r\n       argument, \"with this talk that we hear from merchants and\r\n       bankers that the Prosecution is hurting business. They heard\r\n       the same talk in Boston when our Revolutionary sires threw tea\r\n       overboard. It would hurt business, they said, to have a war\r\n       with England. I can see the picture, when Thomas Jefferson was\r\n       signing the Declaration of Independence, of a large man, who\r\n       looked like the cartoonist's representation of a corporation\r\n       official, coming through the door behind him and shouting,\r\n       'Hold on, Tom, you'll hurt business.' And when Washington was\r\n       spending that terrible winter with his army at Valley Forge,\r\n       the same class of men who are now crying at us in San\r\n       Francisco were shouting for the war to stop. 'Damn principle,'\r\n       they were crying. 'It's hurting business. This war must\r\n       stop.'\"\r\n\r\n [454] \"It is,\" said the Chronicle, commenting upon the adoption of\r\n       such resolutions, \"a matter of common knowledge that there is\r\n       a widespread feeling among those whose good citizenship cannot\r\n       be disputed that the city, having done its best for three\r\n       years, without success, to find legal proof which would\r\n       connect officials of the corporations which profited by the\r\n       corruption of the Schmitz administration with the crime of\r\n       bribery, it is necessary to discontinue the effort. Hitherto\r\n       no one has been willing to formally approach the authorities\r\n       in the matter lest he should appear to show sympathy with\r\n       evildoers. The Richmond Club, however, has formally\r\n       memorialized the Supervisors to withdraw further support by\r\n       appropriations on the ground that it has become apparent that\r\n       success is impossible, and that further effort would be not\r\n       only a waste of money and energy but serve to keep before the\r\n       world the memory of a most disgraceful epoch in our history.\r\n\r\n       \"Bribery of public officials is the most dangerous of crimes.\r\n       It undermines the very foundation of government by the people.\r\n       And yet it has been in this and all other large American\r\n       cities the most common of crimes. In the public mind, and in\r\n       common speech, any person or firm which has habitually done\r\n       business with our city government has been held to have on\r\n       himself the burden of proof that he was innocent of bribery.\r\n       And then came the riot of debauchery under the Schmitz\r\n       administration, with corruption in all forms permeating every\r\n       department of the city government. We have had nothing like\r\n       that before, and yet until the election of the present Board\r\n       of Supervisors this city has almost never had a Board on which\r\n       some members were not believed to be corrupt and constantly on\r\n       the watch for opportunities to 'hold up' those seeking to do\r\n       business with the city. It is not believed that any franchise\r\n       now in existence has been obtained without bribery or operated\r\n       without continuous bribery. It has been generally assumed that\r\n       whoever undertook to do business with the city must buy his\r\n       way in by some form of corruption.\r\n\r\n       \"Bribery is a crime for which conviction is almost impossible.\r\n       Occasionally proof can be got through a decoy, as in the case\r\n       of the Schmitz Supervisors. What was exposed in that way,\r\n       however, was no legal proof against the higher officials of the\r\n       beneficiary corporations. For that other proof must be had, and\r\n       thus far, except in one case, no conviction has been had. And\r\n       unless the courts reverse themselves that conviction will not\r\n       stand. The question then arises as to the duty of the city.\r\n       Shall we continue to expend energy in striving to accomplish\r\n       what we all see to be impossible, or shall the city, having\r\n       done its best, turn its energies into more hopeful channels? As\r\n       to that there will be differences of opinion, nor is it\r\n       possible for anyone to know to what extent those differences\r\n       are founded in reason, and how much on personal hatreds and a\r\n       desire for notoriety.\r\n\r\n       \"There is doubtless a feeling that the continuance of these\r\n       prosecutions is now doing great harm, which could only be\r\n       counterbalanced by conviction based on clear legal proof, for\r\n       which it is impossible to hope. In the first place, it is\r\n       enormously costly and has introduced a universal system of\r\n       spying which is exciting animosity against both sides of these\r\n       cases. Decent citizens are coming to resent secret efforts to\r\n       induce them to compromise themselves on the one side or the\r\n       other. Secondly, the awful exhibitions of perjury in order to\r\n       escape jury duty are shocking the moral sense of the community\r\n       as severely as it was shocked by the exposure of the bribery.\r\n       And the examination of the jurors are resulting in expressions\r\n       of opinion by prospective jurors which do not do the city any\r\n       good. Finally, the conduct of these trials is turning into a\r\n       farce processes which should be the most solemn exhibitions of\r\n       the authority of the law. We must all recognize that it is\r\n       common talk that society ought not to seek to imprison one\r\n       possible criminal at the cost of the imprisonment for months at\r\n       a time of innocent citizens dragged from their homes and\r\n       compelled to listen to the interminable quarrels of counsel\r\n       over matters having no legitimate bearing on the case and\r\n       injected solely for the purpose of confusing jurymen. Everybody\r\n       sees that it will be impossible in the case now on trial to get\r\n       a jury fit to be intrusted with the fate of a dog. Every\r\n       intelligent citizen has been 'disqualified' by reading the\r\n       testimony before the Grand Jury.\r\n\r\n       \"It is a most difficult situation. No reputable citizen is\r\n       willing to seem to impede the course of justice. But, now that\r\n       an organized body has formally raised before the Supervisors a\r\n       question which has long been a daily subject of discussion\r\n       whenever two men have met, it will be necessary to frankly face\r\n       the situation and decide where duty lies.\"\r\n\r\n [455] The following from the Fresno Republican is very good example\r\n       of this excellent but unavailing newspaper support:\r\n\r\n       \"Good people of San Francisco, give heed and take notice, the\r\n       way it looks in the clearer perspective of an outside view.\r\n\r\n       \"Francis J. Heney is a candidate for District Attorney, and he\r\n       is the issue. It is stop the Graft Prosecutions, or go on with\r\n       them. Your votes will determine it.\r\n\r\n       \"You are 'tired of the Graft Prosecutions.' How long did it\r\n       take you to get tired of the graft? Can you not be patient as\r\n       long with militant honesty as you were with sneaking crime?\r\n\r\n       \"You may stop these Prosecutions, if you so vote. But remember\r\n       the whole civilized world is looking on, and will judge you by\r\n       that vote. It is the good name of San Francisco that you are\r\n       voting up or down.\r\n\r\n       \"Banker Hellman says not. He has been to New York and he says\r\n       'New York' wants the Prosecutions stopped, and 'New York' will\r\n       not lend any more money until they are stopped.\r\n\r\n       \"What is Banker Hellman's 'New York?' It is certain banks and\r\n       certain syndicates in New York. And it is the San Francisco\r\n       officials of precisely these syndicates that you are now\r\n       prosecuting. Of course, Patrick Calhoun, of New York, wants the\r\n       prosecution of Patrick Calhoun of San Francisco stopped. It is\r\n       Banker Hellman's privilege to have a mere pendulum which swings\r\n       from his San Francisco office to his New York office and thinks\r\n       it is in New York. But it is not incumbent on you to share that\r\n       mental deficiency. If Banker Hellman should announce in New\r\n       York that he was going to discuss the San Francisco situation,\r\n       his audience would consist of the New York partners of the San\r\n       Francisco grafters. He thinks that is 'New York.' The real New\r\n       York would neither know nor care. It never heard of Banker\r\n       Hellman. But if Francis J. Heney should be announced to discuss\r\n       the San Francisco situation in New York, there is not a place\r\n       of assemblage in the city big enough to hold the people who\r\n       would want to hear and see him. The whole nation knows Heney\r\n       and it has made up its mind about him. It is waiting to see\r\n       what you do, before it makes up its mind about you, too.\r\n\r\n       \"'The prosecutions must stop, some time,' to be sure. But who\r\n       has earned from San Francisco the right to say when? When\r\n       Francis J. Heney says it is time to quit, then it is time; not\r\n       before. He has given his time, his strength, and almost his\r\n       life for you. He has purified your politics and regulated your\r\n       government. He has redeemed your city's name in the esteem of\r\n       the world. He is making for you a fight which no one ever had\r\n       the courage, the persistence or the ability to make before. He\r\n       is not tired yet and he has not surrendered yet. Suppose you\r\n       leave it to him, when it is time to quit.\r\n\r\n       \"People of San Francisco, the world is looking on. It cannot\r\n       determine your decision. Neither can you determine what it will\r\n       think of that decision, when it is made.\"\r\n\r\n [456] Heney on the day after the election issued the following\r\n       statement:\r\n\r\n       \"The first battle for equality before the law has been fought\r\n       and lost, but the war against graft will continue to be waged\r\n       by all true soldiers who have been fighting with me in the\r\n       great cause of common honesty, common decency, and civic\r\n       righteousness.\r\n\r\n       \"The fight between the forces of evil and the forces of good\r\n       is and must be a perpetual one. The first battle of Bull Run\r\n       cast gloom over the entire earth, but that disaster only\r\n       inspired the immortal Lincoln and his followers with stern\r\n       resolution and fresh courage.\r\n\r\n       \"San Francisco has received a sad blow and the cause of\r\n       equality before the law a great setback, but be of good cheer\r\n       and take fresh courage, you many thousands of good men and\r\n       women who have joined in this fight for the maintenance of the\r\n       purity and protection of our homes and the uplifting of the\r\n       moral standards of our city!\r\n\r\n       \"We have been defeated in this election, but the sober moral\r\n       sense of the community will again reassert itself and San\r\n       Francisco will vindicate herself before the world.\r\n\r\n       \"I retract nothing that I have said during the recent campaign.\r\n       On the contrary, I reassert the truth of all that I have stated\r\n       from the public platforms. I have no regrets except that for\r\n       poor San Francisco and the many thousands of people who fought\r\n       shoulder to shoulder with me in the good fight.\r\n\r\n       \"Let us all to-night firmly resolve that we will continue the\r\n       battle for equality before the law with unabated vigor until\r\n       success has crowned our efforts.\"\r\n\r\n               *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n       The following statement was issued by Rudolph Spreckels:\r\n\r\n       \"While the defeat at yesterday's election of the principles for\r\n       which I have fought is regretted by me, it will speedily bring\r\n       about a truer estimate of my real motives.\r\n\r\n       \"One of the compensations of this defeat is that I have so\r\n       quickly been given an opportunity to disprove the charges so\r\n       frequently made that I have been actuated by sordid or\r\n       vindictive motives. The individuals against whom it is alleged\r\n       that I have entertained malicious and selfish designs are\r\n       entirely removed from the possibility of harm at the hands of\r\n       the so-called Prosecution.\r\n\r\n       \"Attempting to punish was an unpleasant and incidental portion\r\n       of the public work which I set out to do. I am glad that the\r\n       people have taken that task off my hands and left me free to do\r\n       the more important part of my undertaking.\r\n\r\n       \"Feeling that the people will fully realize this, I desire to\r\n       say that I shall continue the work of civic regeneration with\r\n       undiminished hope and earnestness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n                       DISMISSAL OF THE GRAFT CASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time of Mr. Fickert's election to the District Attorney's office,\r\nthe second trial of Patrick Calhoun for offering a bribe was well under\r\nway. As at the other graft trials, there had been delays [457] so that\r\nafter five months the jury was only half complete. That the trial could\r\nnot be finished before Mr. Fickert assumed the duties of his office\r\nbecame evident. The case was, for that reason, on December 9, continued\r\nuntil January 10, in order that Mr. Fickert might participate in the\r\nselection of the trial jurors. But on that date, Mr. Fickert, who had\r\nbeen in office only two days, very frankly admitted himself to be\r\nunfamiliar with the facts, and not prepared to go to trial. Further\r\ncontinuance was accordingly granted until January 31, and then until\r\nFebruary 7.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime former Supervisor James L. Gallagher, the pivotal\r\nwitness in the case, had disappeared. Gallagher was known to have been\r\nin San Francisco for some three weeks after Fickert's election. About\r\nDecember 1 he dropped out of sight. He was supposed to have gone to\r\nEurope.[458]\r\n\r\nOn February 7, Mr. Fickert moved the dismissal of the case pending\r\nagainst Mr. Calhoun on the ground that there was not sufficient legal\r\nand competent evidence to warrant him submitting the case to a\r\njury.[459]\r\n\r\nJudge Lawlor denied the motion. In denying it, Judge Lawlor stated that\r\nin the view of the court the action should be tried by a jury and a\r\nverdict should be rendered by a jury, if that were possible, in the full\r\noperation of the law.\r\n\r\nFickert stated in the discussion which followed that he wanted his\r\nmotion to apply to all the other graft cases of the same class as\r\nCalhoun's, with the exception of the defendants Ruef and Schmitz. But\r\nhere again did the Judge deny the District Attorney's request.\r\n\r\nAfter Judge Lawlor's ruling, Calhoun's attorneys announced themselves\r\nready to proceed with the trial of the case. Fickert stated that he\r\nwould be ready in a week. Judge Lawlor thereupon questioned Fickert very\r\nclosely about the absent witness, Gallagher. Fickert gave assurance that\r\ndiligent hunt was being made for the witness.\r\n\r\nThe questioning of the District Attorney was continued ten days later\r\nwhen the case again came up. Judge Lawlor asked Fickert to tell\r\ndefinitely whether he proposed to put the issue before a jury in the\r\nabsence of his material witness.\r\n\r\nFickert replied that Gallagher's absence greatly weakened the State's\r\ncase, and that in his belief certain facts could not be proved without\r\nGallagher being present. But as for that, Fickert insisted that even\r\nwith Gallagher present he did not believe that the State could make out\r\na case.[460] Nevertheless, he continued to insist that he was ready to\r\nproceed to try the action even in the absence of the witness Gallagher.\r\n\r\nBut Judge Lawlor announced that he did not propose to proceed with the\r\ntrial of the action:\r\n\r\n(1) If a material witness were without the jurisdiction of the court.\r\n\r\n(2) If the court did not believe that the cause were to be prosecuted\r\nwith the vigor and fidelity that the law contemplates.[461]\r\n\r\nFickert also stated his position. He insisted that he did not believe\r\nthat any evidence had ever existed against the trolley-graft defendants\r\nAbbott and Mullally, and did not believe it to be his duty as District\r\nAttorney to prosecute men against whom there was no evidence. Fickert\r\neven attempted to commit Judge Lawlor to this proposition, by stating\r\nthat the Judge in chambers had confessed as much. This Judge Lawlor\r\ndenied. Mr. Fickert's assistant, Mr. Berry, had been present during the\r\ndiscussion in chambers between Mr. Fickert and Judge Lawlor, but Mr.\r\nBerry failed to sustain his chief's contention.[462]\r\n\r\n\"In these cases, the cases against Mr. Abbott and Mr. Mullally,\" said\r\nFickert, \"I shall never proceed in them because there is absolutely no\r\nevidence which at all gives even a suspicion.\"\r\n\r\nIn respect to the other cases, Mr. Fickert announced that he intended to\r\ntake the same course that he had in those under discussion, and stated\r\nthat if the Judge so desired he would advise him before hand as to which\r\nof the cases he intended to make a motion for dismissal.\r\n\r\n\"In view of the statement you made on February 7,\"[463] replied Judge\r\nLawlor, \"the Court will not feel called upon to grant any application\r\nlooking to a dismissal of any of those cases. The Court will finally\r\ndeal with them in the manner prescribed by the law. And if that\r\nsituation is not reached so that the Court can proceed with the trial,\r\nthe Court will be under the solemn obligation of setting down in its\r\nminutes the reason why a trial has not been had in any particular\r\ninstance, and why cases are dismissed or disposed of without the trial\r\nof the general issue. The Court cannot escape its responsibilities. I\r\nhave pointed out that under the law it is for the Court to say finally\r\nwhat shall become of cases that are not pressed to conclusion, and when\r\nthe Court does that it must give its reasons--the law says so. In this\r\nState, since the formation of the government therein, the power has not\r\nfor any considerable length of time lodged in the District Attorney to\r\ndispose of actions; that matter is confided to the Court. Counsel will\r\nbe doing injustice to his own position if he assumes that the Court has\r\nany other attitude than to finally dispose of these matters according to\r\nthe law without doing injustice to any person, either to the District\r\nAttorney or any person who is unfortunate enough to be involved. But\r\nwhen the Court comes to write down its action it will be based upon what\r\nit believes to be the fact and upon nothing else.\"\r\n\r\nFickert replied that he was ready to proceed with the matter. To this\r\nJudge Lawlor reiterated that the Court was not going to permit the\r\nDistrict Attorney to proceed in the absence of a witness, who, according\r\nto the District Attorney's own statement, was material.[464]\r\n\r\nNor did the earnest plea of attorneys for the defense for dismissal move\r\nJudge Lawlor. In the absence of the material witness, Gallagher, he\r\ncontinued the case, on the Court's own motion, until April 25.[465]\r\n\r\nOn that date, Calhoun's attorneys moved for dismissal of all the\r\nindictments pending against their client upon the ground that his trial\r\nhad been postponed and continued for more than sixty days without his\r\nconsent and over his objection and exception.\r\n\r\nFickert submitted the motion, fortifying it with a statement that he did\r\nnot believe that the District Attorney's office would be justified in\r\nasking continuance until Gallagher's return.\r\n\r\nJudge Lawlor postponed determination of the motion until July 14.[466]\r\nHis ruling was announced on August 3.\r\n\r\nJudge Lawlor went exhaustively into the situation presented.[467] He\r\npointed out that a material and indispensable witness was absent from\r\nthe State; he stated that the Court was called upon to intervene\r\n\"because the District Attorney has at practically every turn followed\r\nthe lead of these defendants\"; he held that through the influence of\r\nunusual agencies, so far as the graft cases were concerned, the law had\r\nbroken down, and that the crimes charged are of the most serious nature,\r\n\"because such criminal activity tends to sap the very foundations of\r\ngovernment\"; he insisted that before the indictments should be finally\r\ndisposed of every reasonable effort should be made to get at the truth\r\nof the situation.\r\n\r\n\"The disposition of grave charges other than on their merits,\" he\r\nconcluded, \"is not to be encouraged and should not be allowed, except in\r\nthe face of a strict legal necessity.\" He continued the cases until\r\nAugust 29.\r\n\r\nStanley Moore, one of Calhoun's attorneys, when Judge Lawlor had\r\nconcluded, demanded that he be permitted to reply. This demand was\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nThere followed one of the most extraordinary scenes ever recorded of a\r\ncourt of justice. The defendant's attorneys, the District Attorney, and\r\neven the prisoner at bar, openly and contemptuously defied the Judge on\r\nthe bench.\r\n\r\nStanley Moore charged him with \"doing politics from the bench that you\r\nstultify in your occupancy.\" A. A. Moore, another of Calhoun's lawyers,\r\naccused him of being \"a partisan, a bitter partisan, and doing dirty\r\npolitics.\"\r\n\r\n\"And,\" Stanley Moore hastened to add, \"have been before these\r\nindictments were ever filed in this court, as the events of that\r\nmidnight deal in which you participated on April 29 amply\r\ndemonstrate.\"[468]\r\n\r\nDistrict Attorney Fickert, in the face of the Court's direction that he\r\ntake his seat, denounced \"the statements and aspersions you have tried\r\nto cast upon me\" as \"false in each and every particular.\"\r\n\r\nA third of Mr. Calhoun's attorneys added his denunciation. Mr. John\r\nBarrett decried the proceedings as \"infamous.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Lawlor sentenced Calhoun's three attorneys to serve five days each\r\nin the county jail for contempt and ordered the Sheriff to take charge\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nBut the extraordinary scene was not concluded. The prisoner at the bar\r\nhad not yet been heard. Calhoun took the floor to tell the judge on the\r\nbench that should the Judge send him (Calhoun) to jail for contempt \"it\r\nwill be heralded all over this country as an honor.\"[469] The Court\r\nattempted to interrupt the angry defendant. The interruption was\r\nignored. The prisoner at the bar was exhibiting himself as more powerful\r\nin San Francisco than the Judge on the bench. When he had said his say,\r\nhe took his seat.\r\n\r\nThe trolley-graft cases dragged along for more than a year after this\r\nastonishing scene in Judge Lawlor's courtroom.[470] The defendants\r\napplied to the Supreme Court in habeas corpus proceedings, but failed to\r\nsecure interference. They then went to the State District Court of\r\nAppeal, where they secured a writ of mandate directing Judge Lawlor to\r\ndismiss the indictments in the cases of the trolley-graft\r\ndefendants.[471] The District Attorney's office announced to Judge\r\nLawlor that the District Attorney had no intention of prosecuting an\r\nappeal from the judgment and order of the District Court.\r\n\r\nJudge Lawlor thereupon dismissed the cases as directed. He also included\r\nthe cases against Frank G. Drum, Eugene de Sabla and John Martin, which\r\nwere governed by much the same considerations as the trolley cases. Four\r\nyears and a half had passed since the indictments had been brought.\r\nLittle by little, the influence of those of the community who were for\r\nlaw and order and impartial law enforcement had been sapped and broken\r\ndown. The prosecution had been worn out; the community had been worn\r\nout. The defense had shown greater staying qualities than either peace\r\nofficers or community. It had been pretty thoroughly demonstrated that\r\nconvictions could not be had.[472]\r\n\r\nThe dismissal of the trolley-graft and gas-graft cases was the final\r\nbreaking down of San Francisco's efforts to have the cases tried upon\r\ntheir merits. To be sure, the indictments against the telephone-graft\r\ndefendants and the prizefight-graft defendants, and against Schmitz and\r\nRuef still stood. Glass, a telephone-graft defendant, had been\r\nconvicted, but the Supreme Court had reversed the decision on\r\ntechnicalities.[473] The absent witness, Gallagher, was not a material\r\nwitness in the Glass case. But when along in August, 1912, a year after\r\nthe dismissal of the gas and trolley-graft cases, Glass's case was\r\ncalled, it was found that important witnesses had disappeared. The\r\nincident was taken by the papers, not as a reflection upon the\r\ncommunity, but as a joke on Judge Lawlor.[474] The Glass cases were\r\nfinally dismissed.\r\n\r\nFormer Mayor Schmitz in February, 1912, was brought to trial. Ruef was\r\nbrought over from San Quentin prison to testify against him. But Ruef\r\nrefused to testify unless the Ruef indictments were dismissed. This,\r\nJudge Dunne,[475] before whom many Ruef indictments were pending,\r\nrefused to do. Ruef did not testify. Schmitz was acquitted. The other\r\nindictments against Schmitz were eventually dismissed.\r\n\r\nThe same course followed in the cases of the other graft defendants. The\r\ngraft defense had beaten San Francisco; its record of shameful success\r\nwas complete.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [457] The second trial of Patrick Calhoun (No. 1437) was begun July\r\n       19, 1909. Owing to the illness of one of Mr. Calhoun's\r\n       counsel, the trial was suspended on August 16th, and resumed\r\n       September 30th. The following day the defendant secured\r\n       further continuance until November 15th, upon the ground of\r\n       the pendency of a municipal political campaign. After the\r\n       election the trial was resumed. On December 9th, it was, by\r\n       agreement between the parties continued until January 10th,\r\n       when the new District Attorney should be in office.\r\n\r\n [458] The motives which prompted Gallagher to flee the city are\r\n       among the undetermined elements of the graft cases. Perhaps\r\n       recollection of his attempted assassination had something to\r\n       do with it. It may be that the defense, which had done so many\r\n       extraordinary things during the course of the graft trials,\r\n       made it worth his while to go. Gallagher is known to have been\r\n       plentifully supplied with money while he was away. An attempt\r\n       was made to create the impression that agents of the\r\n       Prosecution had been instrumental in getting Gallagher out of\r\n       the State. But the attempt, while it confused the situation\r\n       somewhat, was not taken seriously. When in August, 1911, Judge\r\n       Lawlor dismissed the indictments against the alleged\r\n       bribe-givers in the trolley case, he took occasion to say: \"I\r\n       am more convinced now than I was when these same motions were\r\n       urged more than a year ago, that James L. Gallagher is\r\n       remaining out of this jurisdiction for a specific purpose. The\r\n       future will make that point entirely clear. When his\r\n       importance as a witness in any of these so-called graft cases\r\n       has ceased there is no doubt that James L. Gallagher will be\r\n       again in our midst. If I were able to lay the responsibility\r\n       for that situation upon any individual or set of individuals I\r\n       repeat that appropriate proceedings would have been instituted\r\n       to have the law redressed in that behalf.\"\r\n\r\n       Judge Lawlor was right. After the dismissal of the graft cases\r\n       Mr. Gallagher returned to San Francisco.\r\n\r\n       To the intimation of District Attorney Fickert that Gallagher\r\n       left the State to embarrass the District Attorney's\r\n       administration, Judge Lawlor on one occasion said in an\r\n       opinion: \"That the former administration may have distrusted\r\n       the official intentions of the District Attorney toward these\r\n       indictments might be assumed from all the surrounding\r\n       circumstances. But it does not seem probable that the former\r\n       administration would induce a material and indispensable\r\n       witness to leave the State and thereby make it easy for the\r\n       District Attorney to secure a result which otherwise might\r\n       entail serious embarrassment. So far as the showing is\r\n       concerned there is no tangible proof tending to support the\r\n       charge of the District Attorney, nor is there any proof which\r\n       would justify such an inference.\"\r\n\r\n [459] Fickert's motion had been prepared in advance and was read to\r\n       the court. \"Since the calling of this case on January 10th,\"\r\n       he said, \"I have made a thorough and careful examination of\r\n       the evidence left in the District Attorney's office by my\r\n       predecessor, Mr. Langdon, and he informed me on my accession\r\n       to the office, that he had delivered to me all the evidence of\r\n       every kind and character in his possession or under his\r\n       control in this case. I have also examined the transcript of\r\n       testimony given at the former trial of this defendant; besides\r\n       this, I have made independent search for further evidence.\r\n       These examinations convince me that there is not sufficient\r\n       legal and competent evidence to justify me, as a sworn officer\r\n       of the law, to present this case to a jury.\r\n\r\n       \"My opinion is confirmed by the fact that 42 out of 48 jurors\r\n       sworn to try this defendant and the defendant, Tirey L. Ford,\r\n       upon the same state of facts, voted 'Not Guilty.' I,\r\n       therefore, 'In furtherance of justice,' move the dismissal of\r\n       this indictment, on the grounds that the evidence is wholly\r\n       insufficient to warrant another trial of this case.\"\r\n\r\n [460] Judge Lawlor was also careful to make clear that if the court\r\n       proceeded with the formation of a jury, jeopardy would attach\r\n       to the case. He also pointed out that the statute of\r\n       limitations had run against the alleged crimes. The following\r\n       is from the transcript, the questions being directed to Mr.\r\n       Fickert:\r\n\r\n       The Court: You are aware that if you proceed to form a jury to\r\n       try this issue, and the witness does not appear, that jeopardy\r\n       has nevertheless attached and that the defendant will be\r\n       entitled to ask for his deliverance at the hands of that jury,\r\n       whether that witness is produced or not.\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Fickert: Yes, I am aware of that, if your Honor please.\r\n\r\n       \"The Court: And you are aware further that the alleged\r\n       criminal act set up in the indictment is outlawed within the\r\n       meaning of Section 800 of the Penal Code; that is to say, that\r\n       more than three years have intervened since it is claimed that\r\n       that act was committed.\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Fickert: That is correct, if your Honor please.\r\n\r\n       \"The Court: The witness, James L. Gallagher, gave testimony in\r\n       the trial of case 1436 against this defendant. You are aware\r\n       that the testimony relating to an indictment cannot be read to\r\n       a jury on a retrial of the action; in other words, that if\r\n       James L. Gallagher does not appear in this trial his testimony\r\n       cannot be presented to the jury.\"\r\n\r\n       Fickert suggested that counsel might stipulate that the\r\n       evidence be read. But counsel for Mr. Calhoun hastened to\r\n       assure Mr. Fickert that counsel would stipulate to nothing of\r\n       the kind.\r\n\r\n [461] \"At the present time,\" said Judge Lawlor in making this\r\n       announcement, \"it is the intention of the Court to deal with\r\n       this matter, so far as the absence of that material witness is\r\n       concerned, and to suspend judgment as to the ultimate attitude\r\n       of the District Attorney in respect to this and other causes\r\n       before the Court. I do not intend to sit here and preside over\r\n       a trial if for any reason, whether it seems sufficient to the\r\n       District Attorney or not, the Court reaches the conclusion\r\n       that the case is not being prosecuted in good faith. The\r\n       Court, in pointing out the duty of the District Attorney on\r\n       February 7th, was not inviting a suggestion that we should\r\n       proceed to trial without regard to the outcome of that trial\r\n       or to its particular features or the manner in which it should\r\n       be tried. The Court will try no case, it will not consume its\r\n       own time, it will not consume the time of others, it will not\r\n       allow the expenditure of public money for the mere purpose of\r\n       going through the forms of a trial. The Court must feel in the\r\n       end that the people are represented. Now, what its final view\r\n       shall be as to the District Attorney will be announced when\r\n       the Court deems that announcement pertinent and proper. The\r\n       Court has its own views as to what may be done within the\r\n       exercise of its prerogative in the event that it does not feel\r\n       that the people are represented, and will act upon its own\r\n       judgment when that time arrives. At this time the witness\r\n       being absent from the jurisdiction of the Court, the Court\r\n       points out to the District Attorney his duty under Section\r\n       1052 of the Penal Code, to move for a proper continuance of\r\n       this action until the Court can be advised as to whether or\r\n       not that witness can be produced.\"\r\n\r\n       Later, when Fickert suggested that all criminal causes be\r\n       transferred to some other department where the judge might be\r\n       of a different opinion, Judge Lawlor said:\r\n\r\n       \"I have had no occasion to find fault with your acts in\r\n       respect to any other causes that have been brought before this\r\n       Court. I am endeavoring to have your mind concentrated upon\r\n       one thing, and that is the matters which are before this\r\n       Court, and for the prosecution of which you, under your sworn\r\n       oath of office are required to give your full attention to.\r\n       Your own statement in support of your motion to dismiss this\r\n       case evinces in my judgment a disposition not to do your duty.\r\n       However, I still say that this matter I bring to your\r\n       attention, and ask you to give full reflection upon the\r\n       matter. I have no desire in any manner to hamper you. The\r\n       process of this Court is at your disposal at all times, in all\r\n       causes, and if any person or set of persons be found to be\r\n       interfering with the due administration of Justice you will\r\n       have a full hearing before this Court in order that you shall\r\n       not be so hampered. Your statement concerning these cases is\r\n       calculated not alone to affect the fortune of these\r\n       undetermined cases, but it is well calculated to affect the\r\n       disposition of the other causes and other charges wherein\r\n       convictions were had against other persons growing out of this\r\n       alleged transaction, and which cases are now on their way for\r\n       a determination to the courts of appeal in this State.\"\r\n\r\n [462] \"I think your Honor well knows,\" Fickert had said, \"that\r\n       certain defendants in this particular class of cases, that\r\n       there have not been produced here in Court, and I do not think\r\n       ever existed, any evidence against them. I allude to Mr.\r\n       Abbott and Mr. Mullally. And I so informed you in your\r\n       chambers, and you in words confessed that proposition.\"\r\n\r\n       Judge Lawlor took this statement up. The following is from the\r\n       transcript:\r\n       \"The Court: Now, before you pass to those other cases, in\r\n       regard to these two cases do you make the statement that I\r\n       made any statement to you, in the presence of Mr. Berry, that\r\n       I said there was not sufficient evidence?\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Fickert: I so informed you, and you, in effect, so\r\n       stated.\r\n\r\n       \"The Court: Did you so understand it, Mr. Berry?\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Fickert: That there was no evidence against those men?\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Berry: I remember Mr. Fickert saying he did not consider\r\n       there was any evidence against those men, but I do not\r\n       remember the Court's reply: I do not remember that the Court\r\n       did reply.\r\n\r\n       \"The Court: I did not. It is not the province of the Court to\r\n       pass upon the facts in a criminal case. The facts are placed\r\n       before a jury, and the jury pass on the facts.\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Fickert: I am certainly not mistaken in that matter.\r\n\r\n       \"The Court: You are certainly mistaken in that matter; I was\r\n       careful not to make any such statement.\"\r\n\r\n [463] See footnote 459, page 426.\r\n\r\n [464] \"In dealing with the attitude of the District Attorney,\" said\r\n       Judge Lawlor, \"as is manifested by all that I have said upon\r\n       that subject, I have endeavored to deal justly with him, to\r\n       reach no conclusion myself definitely as to the attitude of\r\n       the District Attorney. I sincerely hope that in these cases,\r\n       as in all cases that may come before the Court, the District\r\n       Attorney will do his full duty. I desire it equally\r\n       understood, however, that if the District Attorney in any case\r\n       fails of his duty the Court is not going to be recreant and it\r\n       is not going to sit here as a minister of justice and permit a\r\n       travesty in any form, for any purpose, whatever the views of\r\n       the District Attorney may be. Now, I have endeavored to make\r\n       it clear that there are two considerations that will affect\r\n       the Court in the final disposition of this business: First,\r\n       that it will not proceed with the trial of any action where\r\n       material testimony is not forthcoming. That would be the\r\n       disposition of the Court in any case, but it is especially its\r\n       attitude in this case in view of the sweeping statement of the\r\n       District Attorney made on February 7th that there is no\r\n       sufficient evidence upon which to proceed to trial against any\r\n       of these four defendants.\"\r\n\r\n [465] The statement was made repeatedly that Gallagher was not under\r\n       subpoena when he left the State. The statement was even\r\n       contained in the opinion of the Appellate Court, granting the\r\n       writ of mandate that preceded the dismissal of the graft\r\n       cases. Judge Lawlor at the proceedings when the cases were\r\n       finally dismissed, touched upon this feature as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"The Court: The statement has been made in the opinion that I\r\n       am not able to account for its appearance in the showing. This\r\n       statement was made that no service had been made upon James L.\r\n       Gallagher or that he was not under the order of the Court.\r\n       That is a proposition of fact which has never been resolved by\r\n       this Court and I am unable to determine how it could be\r\n       determined elsewhere, how it could be declared elsewhere, in\r\n       the absence of such testimony as I might be able to give on\r\n       the subject. I expressly refrained, on an occasion when I made\r\n       an extended statement covering these cases, from making any\r\n       final word on that subject. I am not prepared now to say so,\r\n       because I don't know.\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Berry: I will state to the Court that I have made a very\r\n       careful inquiry in the District Attorney's office, and of the\r\n       records, and of the officials in that office in the previous\r\n       administration, and I have been unable to secure or to get any\r\n       definite information on that point.\"\r\n\r\n [466] Judge Lawlor, in announcing this decision, said in part:\r\n       \"Section 13 of Article I of the Constitution provides in\r\n       part: 'In criminal prosecutions in any court whatever the\r\n       party accused shall have the right to a speedy and public trial.\r\n       * * *.' Section 1382 of the Penal Code declares in part: 'The\r\n       court, unless good cause to the contrary is shown, must order\r\n       the prosecution to be dismissed in the following cases: * * *.\r\n       2. If a defendant, whose trial has not been postponed upon his\r\n       application, is not brought to trial within sixty days after\r\n       the finding of the indictment, or filing of the information.'\r\n\r\n       \"This provision has repeatedly been declared to be a statutory\r\n       expression with reference to the section of the constitution\r\n       to which the Court has referred. It has been held to mark the\r\n       period within which a party accused of crime is to be brought\r\n       to trial, unless good cause to the contrary is shown. About\r\n       the general proposition of law involved in the determination\r\n       of the present motion there can be little ground for\r\n       contention. The perplexity usually arises in the determination\r\n       of what the reserve language of Subdivision 2 of Section 1382\r\n       of the Penal Code may be included to cover. An application of\r\n       this character must be determined according to the peculiar\r\n       circumstances surrounding the application.\" * * *\r\n\r\n       \"The Court is of the view that so far as the determination of\r\n       the motion itself is concerned the onus is on the People to\r\n       show good cause, which would take the case out of the\r\n       operation of the constitutional provision and the statute\r\n       referred to. The Court, in that view of the matter, has\r\n       addressed the District Attorney as to what his attitude is\r\n       with respect to the motion, and the District Attorney has made\r\n       it plain that it is not his intention to take any step toward\r\n       meeting the application of the defendant to have the causes\r\n       dismissed. In the view which the Court takes of the general\r\n       attitude of the District Attorney toward the four defendants\r\n       at bar, the Court feels it is a case where it must act, and to\r\n       the extent that it may be needed, to protect the public\r\n       interests. The Court has judicial knowledge of the history of\r\n       the charges against these four defendants. It knows judicially\r\n       that a material, and, it is claimed, an indispensable witness\r\n       to the prosecution of these charges is without the\r\n       jurisdiction of the State. It is not prepared, on any evidence\r\n       before it, to charge the responsibility of the absence of that\r\n       witness either to the former administration or to the present\r\n       administration in the District Attorney's office. The fact,\r\n       however, that the witness is absent from the State and not\r\n       within reach of the process of the Court, is a fact\r\n       established before the Court at this time.\r\n\r\n       \"It is not the intention of the Court to disregard the rights\r\n       of this or any other defendant, that may be urged before this\r\n       Court, but, it is likewise the disposition of the Court, to\r\n       see that the public interests are safeguarded, and that no\r\n       arrangement between the defendants and the sworn officer of\r\n       the law shall be suffered to direct and control the action of\r\n       this Court. And in that view of the matter the Court has\r\n       reached the conclusion that it is its duty to continue these\r\n       causes further, in order to see whether or not the missing\r\n       witness can be secured, and if he cannot be secured within\r\n       such time as this Court may deem to be proper and which would\r\n       take the case out of the exception contained in the provision\r\n       of the statute, and the constitutional provision, then to deal\r\n       with this motion.\r\n\r\n       \"It is therefore ordered that the determination of the pending\r\n       motion in the causes against the four defendants named be\r\n       continued for further hearing until 10 a. m., Thursday, July\r\n       14, 1910.\"\r\n\r\n [467] Judge Lawlor's decision will be found in full in the Appendix,\r\n       page i.\r\n\r\n [468] See Chapter XV.\r\n\r\n [469] Calhoun's denunciation of Judge Lawlor was as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Calhoun: May it please your Honor: I have been educated,\r\n       sir, to have respect for the courts. I have sat in your court\r\n       under circumstances that would have tried the patience of any\r\n       American. Throughout these trials I have sought, sir, to give\r\n       you under most trying circumstances that respect to which your\r\n       office entitles you. But, sir, I cannot sit quiet and listen\r\n       to the vile insinuations which you yourself have stated there\r\n       was no evidence before you to justify. There have been\r\n       periods, sir, when the greatest honor that could come to a man\r\n       was to go to jail; and as an American citizen I say to you\r\n       that if you should send me for contempt it will be heralded\r\n       all over this country as an honor. You have seen fit, sir, to\r\n       send three of the most distinguished counsel of this State to\r\n       jail. Why? Because they have sought to express in terms of\r\n       respect, and yet in terms of strength, their protest against\r\n       injustice----\r\n\r\n       \"The Court: Mr. Calhoun----\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Calhoun: There is a time--pardon me, your Honor--when\r\n       every man has a right to be heard----\r\n\r\n       \"The Court: Mr. Calhoun----\r\n\r\n       \"Mr. Calhoun: Now, before I take my seat, I desire further to\r\n       say this, that any insinuation that implies either that I was\r\n       a party to any obstruction of justice, or that I was a party\r\n       to the absence of this witness, or that I have sought to\r\n       control the District Attorney's office of this city is untrue.\r\n       There is no evidence before this Court. You yourself know it.\"\r\n\r\n [470] Judge Lawlor's term of office expired in January, 1913. At the\r\n       1912 November elections he was a candidate for re-election.\r\n       The force of the influence of the graft defense was thrown\r\n       against him. Nevertheless, he was re-elected to serve as\r\n       Superior Judge of the City and County of San Francisco until\r\n       January, 1919. In November, 1914, however, he was elected to\r\n       the Supreme Bench of the State, his term of office beginning\r\n       in January, 1915, and ending in January, 1927.\r\n\r\n [471] Of the three Appellate Judges who granted this writ, one of\r\n       them, Kerrigan, was prominent in the flash-light picture taken\r\n       at Santa Cruz during the 1906 State Convention, in which Ruef\r\n       occupied the center position of honor. See Chapter IV.\r\n\r\n [472] Assistant District Attorney Berry on the occasion of the\r\n       dismissal of the indictments said on this point: \"If the men\r\n       who are involved in this transaction have transgressed the\r\n       laws they are sowing the wind possibly which may reap the\r\n       whirlwind by breaking down the institutions of the land. I\r\n       regret exceedingly, if these men are guilty of the offense\r\n       with which they have stood charged here, that they cannot be\r\n       convicted. I assure the Court and I state here that it would\r\n       be my purpose to follow these cases, if these defendants are\r\n       guilty and the evidence were had, to the uttermost in order to\r\n       bring about the ends of justice. It is no doubt in the minds\r\n       of the community that where men of prominence and where men of\r\n       wealth are concerned, and are brought before the bar of\r\n       justice and justice is not had, that those who are less\r\n       fortunate in influence and means are thereby made to feel and\r\n       believe that this is not a government for those who stand\r\n       before the law equal with those who stand with the tremendous\r\n       power of influence behind them.\"\r\n\r\n [473] The seven Justices of the Supreme Court took no less than four\r\n       views of the points raised in the Glass case. The majority\r\n       opinion was written by Justice Henshaw, and concurred in by\r\n       Justices Melvin and Lorigan. Chief Justice Beatty concurred in\r\n       the judgment, but not in all the particulars of the opinion.\r\n       In signing the decision, the Chief Justice adds: \"I concur in\r\n       the judgment of reversal and in most particulars in the\r\n       opinion of Justice Henshaw. I shall, if other pressing duties\r\n       permit, present my views in a separate opinion.\" (See 112\r\n       Pacific Reporter, page 297.) The dissenting opinion was\r\n       written by Justice Shaw and concurred in by Justice\r\n       Angellotti. A third opinion was written by Justice Sloss.\r\n       Justice Sloss, after defending the single point in the\r\n       majority opinion in which he concurs, concludes: \"On each of\r\n       the other points discussed in the opinion of Justice Henshaw,\r\n       I agree with the dissenting members of the court (Shaw and\r\n       Angellotti) that no prejudicial error was committed.\"\r\n\r\n       The fourth opinion, which the Chief Justice intimated he might\r\n       file, was not filed.\r\n\r\n [474] The following from the San Francisco Call of August 2, 1912,\r\n       indicates the completeness of the triumph of the defense\r\n       campaign:\r\n\r\n       \"Mrs. Theodore Halsey, wife of Theodore V. Halsey, appeared\r\n       before Superior Judge Lawlor yesterday morning on a bench\r\n       warrant in the case of Louis Glass, indicted for bribery in\r\n       the telephone cases growing out of the so-called Graft\r\n       Prosecution. She was in court to explain the absence of her\r\n       husband from the State, whose appearance is wanted if Lawlor\r\n       orders Glass to trial.\r\n\r\n       \"Attorney Bert Schlesinger appeared with Mrs. Halsey,\r\n       explaining the bench warrant was void inasmuch as Mrs. Halsey\r\n       was not a fugitive. He said he did not wish to impede the\r\n       trial in any way and would allow her to answer any questions\r\n       propounded by the Court.\r\n\r\n       \"Lawlor asked Mrs. Halsey, through her attorney, where her\r\n       husband was. Mrs. Halsey was not compelled to take the stand.\r\n       She said Halsey left San Francisco six weeks ago because of\r\n       ill health, going to Nevada, and that she has not heard from\r\n       him in a week.\r\n\r\n       \"Assistant District Attorney Berry said a motion was before\r\n       the Court to dismiss the indictments pending against Glass and\r\n       he wished to know the Court's intention. Lawlor said he\r\n       believed Halsey and Emil J. Zimmer, who is said to be in\r\n       Europe, were competent witnesses against Glass, and it was his\r\n       duty to try Glass again. He said the result of the former\r\n       Glass trials showed Halsey had knowledge of the source of the\r\n       bribe money and who paid it to the Supervisors.\r\n\r\n       \"Lawlor continued the cases of Glass until August 12th, to\r\n       learn from the District Attorney if the Prosecution has\r\n       exhausted all its resources in the matter.\r\n\r\n       \"Schlesinger and Mrs. Halsey were about to leave the courtroom\r\n       when Lawlor said, 'I trust, Mr. Schlesinger, you will inform\r\n       the Court of the whereabouts of Mr. Halsey, if you learn in\r\n       the meantime.'\r\n\r\n       \"'I will assist the Court in any way possible,' replied\r\n       Schlesinger. 'But I regard all these Graft Prosecutions as\r\n       corpses and the mourners have long since ceased to mourn.'\r\n\r\n       \"The Judge said nothing in the record showed such a condition.\r\n       Detective Sergeant Prool took the stand and said he had\r\n       learned nothing more of the whereabouts of either Halsey or\r\n       Zimmer.\"\r\n\r\n [475] Judge Dunne, until the last, stood as staunchly for effective\r\n       prosecution of the graft cases as had Judge Lawlor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n                       RUEF'S LAST REFUGE FAILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat a jury of twelve men had found Ruef guilty of bribe-giving did not\r\nmean necessarily that the broken boss would be confined at San Quentin,\r\nthe prison to which he had been sentenced to serve his fourteen-year\r\nterm. Indeed, the probabilities were very much against his suffering any\r\nsuch indignity. Ruef had, at the test, continued \"true to his class\"; he\r\nhad not assisted the State in bringing the bribe-givers to account. Men,\r\npowerful in financial, social and political circles were unquestionably\r\nunder the greatest obligation to him. He had not \"gone back on his\r\nclass.\" His \"class\" owed it to him to save him from stripes, as Ruef by\r\nhis course had beyond question saved many of his \"class\" from stripes.\r\n\r\nHaving been convicted by a jury, the first move was for Ruef to appeal\r\nto the trial judge for a new trial. This appeal was denied him. Ruef\r\nthen appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the District Court\r\nof Appeal. The three justices of the District Court of Appeal found\r\nnothing in Ruef's contention to warrant the granting of a new\r\ntrial.[476] Thus four judges found that Ruef's trial had been fair, even\r\ntechnically fair. But Ruef's possibilities were not exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court could, if four of the seven members were so inclined,\r\ngrant him a rehearing, and to the Supreme Court Ruef applied.\r\n\r\nThe California State Constitution provides that \"the Supreme Court shall\r\nhave power to order any cause pending ... before a district court of\r\nappeal to be heard and determined by the Supreme Court. The order last\r\nmentioned may be made before judgment has been pronounced by a district\r\ncourt of appeal, or within thirty days after such judgment shall have\r\nbecome final therein.\"\r\n\r\nThe District Court of Appeal found against Ruef on November 23, 1910;\r\nthis action became final thirty days later, or on December 23, 1910. The\r\nSupreme Court had thirty days after December 23, that is to say, until\r\nJanuary 22, 1911, to grant Ruef a rehearing, if a majority of the seven\r\nSupreme Justices so decided. If the Supreme Court failed to act before\r\nthe close of January 22, Ruef, unless pardoned or paroled, would have\r\nto go to State prison.\r\n\r\nRuef, on December 31, 1910, petitioned the Supreme Court for a\r\nrehearing. On January 23, announcement was made that the Supreme Court,\r\nby a four to three decision, had decided to grant Ruef's petition. The\r\ndecision was received with protest from one end of the State to the\r\nother.[478] The Legislature was in session at the time. Senator George\r\nW. Cartwright of Fresno introduced a resolution requesting the\r\nAssembly--where impeachment proceedings must originate--to take such\r\nsteps as might be deemed necessary for investigation of the Supreme\r\nCourt's conduct.\r\n\r\nAnd finally there came the rumor--at first not generally believed, but\r\nlater confirmed by the Supreme Justices themselves--that one of the\r\nJustices at least had signed the order granting Ruef his rehearing\r\nbefore the Attorney-General had filed his brief in answer to Ruef's\r\npetition. The Justice who had thus acted was Justice Henshaw, the same\r\nSupreme Court Justice who occupied prominent position in the picture of\r\nthe banquet scene at the 1906 Santa Cruz convention, in which Ruef\r\nappears in the central position of honor.[480]\r\n\r\nThe facts later brought out involved the following dates:\r\n\r\nDecember 31, 1910--Ruef's petition for rehearing was filed in Supreme\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nJanuary 10--W. H. Metson was granted permission to file a brief in the\r\ncase as _Amicus Curiae_.\r\n\r\nJanuary 10--Justice Henshaw signed the order granting Ruef a rehearing.\r\n\r\nJanuary 11--Justice Henshaw left the State and was absent until after\r\nthe order granting Ruef a rehearing had been filed.\r\n\r\nJanuary 12--Metson filed his brief as _Amicus Curiae_.\r\n\r\nJanuary 12--The Attorney-General filed his reply to Ruef's petition for\r\na rehearing.\r\n\r\nJanuary 19--Justice Melvin signed the order granting Ruef's petition.\r\n\r\nJanuary 20--Attorney-General filed reply to Metson's brief.\r\n\r\nJanuary 21--Chief Justice Beatty, and Justices Shaw, Angellotti, Lorigan\r\nand Sloss met in the chambers of the Chief Justice for consultation\r\nregarding Ruef's petition. Justice Lorigan signed the order granting the\r\npetition. Justices Shaw, Angellotti and Sloss declined to concur in such\r\norder, and Chief Justice Beatty reserved his decision in the matter\r\nuntil January 22, 1911.\r\n\r\nJanuary 22, 1911--(Sunday, the last day on which the order could be\r\nsigned) Chief Justice Beatty signed the order, his being the fourth name\r\non the document, four signatures being necessary to make it effective.\r\n\r\nJanuary 23--A typewritten copy of the order was filed with the Clerk of\r\nthe Court, the original being retained in the office of the secretaries\r\nto the Justices.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, eleven judges had passed upon Ruef's case. Seven of\r\nthem--one Superior Judge, three Judges of the District Court of Appeal\r\nand three Justices of the Supreme Court--had decided that Ruef had had a\r\nfair trial, that no technicality could be invoked to save him. Four of\r\nthe eleven judges, in a way which, to the lay mind at least, was\r\nsomewhat irregular, had decided to grant a rehearing. The public was not\r\nat all backward in expressing the opinion that this would mean a new\r\ntrial; and that under conditions as they were at San Francisco, Ruef\r\nwould not for a second time be convicted.[481] As is usual in such\r\ncases, the public was dissatisfied, suspicious, indignant, but without\r\nplan or remedy. Some demanded investigation at the hands of the\r\nLegislature; others wanted impeachment[482] proceedings instituted. Mr.\r\nWilliam Denman, a leader of the California bar, urged before the Senate\r\nJudiciary Committee that the Legislature owed it to the Supreme Court,\r\nas well as to itself and to the public, to make thorough investigation,\r\nand demanded of the committee if the Legislature on proper showing would\r\ndeclare the office of a Supreme Justice vacant.\r\n\r\nSenator Shanahan, a member of the committee, was quick to reply that\r\nunder such a showing the Legislature would certainly act. \"But,\" added\r\nShanahan--and here he touched the weak point of impeachment\r\nproceedings--\"it would take months if not years. That is why impeachment\r\nproceedings will not be instituted. Impeachment proceedings from the\r\ntrial of Warren Hastings to the present time have proved\r\nunsatisfactory.\"\r\n\r\nBut, however individuals differed on the question of impeachment\r\nproceedings, the general attitude was that the Attorney-General should\r\ntake steps, if such course were practical, to have the order granting\r\nRuef a rehearing set aside. This the Attorney-General did. He attacked\r\nthe order before the tribunal which had made it, the highest tribunal in\r\nthe State, the only one to which appeal could be made.\r\n\r\nAnd the Supreme Court set the order aside, declaring it to be\r\n\"ineffectual for any purpose and void.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Supreme Court did not set the order aside because Justice\r\nHenshaw had signed the document before the argument of the prosecution\r\nhad been heard. The order was set aside on the ground that Henshaw,\r\nbeing absent from the State when the signature of the fourth Justice was\r\nattached thereto, was at the time, being absent from the State, unable\r\nto exercise any judicial function as a Justice of the Supreme Court.\r\nWithout Henshaw's signature, the signatures of but three of the Supreme\r\nJustices appeared on the order. As the signatures of four of the\r\nJustices were required to make the order effective the Court declared it\r\nto be worthless.[483]\r\n\r\nThirty days from the time the judgment of the District Court of Appeal\r\nbecame final having expired, the Supreme Court could not interfere\r\nfurther. Ruef had lost his last technical play on a technicality. He\r\nwent to State prison.\r\n\r\nBut Ruef did not go to State prison because a jury of twelve men had\r\nfound him guilty of offering a bribe to a Supervisor; he did not go to\r\nState prison because seven out of eleven judges who passed upon the\r\nquestions involved had found that he had had a fair trial. Ruef went to\r\nState prison when he did because a member of the Supreme Court of\r\nCalifornia was absent from the State at a time inopportune for Ruef.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, after his failure in the Supreme Court, Ruef would have had\r\ntwo more chances for escaping the full penalty of his bribe-giving,\r\nnamely, parole at the hands of the State Board of Prison Directors, and\r\npardon from the Governor.\r\n\r\nBut again was Ruef unfortunate. Hiram W. Johnson, as Governor of\r\nCalifornia, sat at Sacramento. He had gone into office pledged \"to kick\r\nthe Southern Pacific machine out of the State government.\" He was\r\nkeeping his pledge. There was no pressure which men of Mr. Ruef's\r\n\"class\" could bring upon Governor Johnson to move him to grant Ruef\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of parole was as remote, although the State Board of\r\nPrison Directors--who in California are appointed for ten-year\r\nterms--continued for a time under the old order.\r\n\r\nOne of the five directors was Tirey L. Ford[484] of the United Railroads.\r\nRuef went to prison convicted of a charge of bribing a Supervisor to\r\nvote to give the United Railroads its overhead trolley permit. The\r\nevidence indicated, if it did not show, and Mr. Ruef has since\r\nconfessed, that this money came to him from General Ford. Ruef, because\r\nof the crime, found himself confined in a prison of which General Ford\r\nwas one of the five governors, with power of parole in his hands. But\r\nit developed that Governor Johnson had power to set aside such parole.\r\nSo Ruef could expect little from even the Board of Prison Directors.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Ruef been placed behind the bars, however, than a\r\nState-wide campaign was inaugurated to compel his pardon or parole. The\r\npublic was treated daily by the newspapers with descriptions of the\r\ndiscomfitures[485] which Ruef was suffering. When he was found, for\r\nexample, smuggling sweet chocolates into prison, and was punished for\r\nit, the Ruef-friendly press cried out at the cruelty and\r\nunreasonableness of such punishment.[486]\r\n\r\nThe suffering which his imprisonment has brought upon the members of\r\nhis family is dwelt upon at length. Letters from them, pleading for\r\nassistance for their imprisoned relative have been received by many\r\nwhose assistance it was thought might prove effective in securing his\r\nrelease. But when Ruef was brought back from San Quentin prison to San\r\nFrancisco to testify at Schmitz's trial, the pathetic story was\r\npublished broadcast that these letter-writing relatives had been kept in\r\nignorance of his imprisonment, and thought him to be traveling in\r\nEurope.[487]\r\n\r\nOne of the most contemptible stories circulated to create public opinion\r\nfor his release was that Ruef had been made scapegoat because of his\r\nreligion. Ruef is a Jew, circulators of this story insisted that he is\r\nin prison because he is a Jew, while the gentile bribe-givers go free.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the gentiles associated with Ruef have gone free\r\nbecause of Ruef's treachery to the graft prosecution, but this does not\r\nprevent the circulation of the story.\r\n\r\nA saner view, breathing of better citizenship, came from Rabbi Stephen\r\nS. Wise of the New York Free Synagogue. \"Israel,\" said Rabbi Wise, \"is\r\nnot responsible for Ruef's crimes any more than the Roman or Protestant\r\nChurch is responsible for the crimes of its communicants. But we of the\r\nHouse of Israel in America would be in part answerable for Ruef's\r\nmisdeeds unless we made it clear, as we do, that Israel is unutterably\r\npained by this blot upon its record of good citizenship in America.\"\r\n\r\nBy far the most astonishing support of the movement to free Ruef came\r\nfrom the San Francisco Bulletin and Fremont Older, its managing editor.\r\nOlder was one of the strongest supporters of the graft prosecution, as\r\nwas the paper under his management. But once the graft prosecution was\r\nconcluded, Older and the Bulletin became the most persistent of the\r\nsupporters of the movement to secure Ruef his freedom.[488] Largely\r\nthrough Older's influence, men of prominence throughout the\r\ncountry--with apparently no very clear knowledge of the situation--have\r\nbeen induced to express themselves as favorable to Ruef's release.\r\n\r\nIn the publicity campaign for Ruef's release which gives no indication\r\nof abatement, Ruef, and those who seek his release, are praised in the\r\nmost extravagant terms, while those who will not enroll themselves in\r\nhis interests are as extravagantly condemned.[489]\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all that is being done to create public opinion\r\nfavorable to Ruef's release, the sober expression of machine-free press\r\nand public is that Ruef should be treated both on the score of parole\r\nand confinement precisely the same as any other prisoner.[490] This\r\nattitude was clearly presented by the Fresno Republican at the time Ruef\r\nwas found smuggling chocolate sweets into the prison.\r\n\r\nIn the attitude of prison officials toward Ruef, the Republican pointed\r\nout, there are two alternatives. \"One,\" the Republican went on to say,\r\n\"is the course of Warden Hoyle, in treating Ruef like any other\r\nprisoner, and disciplining him humanely but sternly, for any infraction\r\nof the necessary prison rules. The other is to let Ruef have privileges\r\nwhich the other prisoners do not and can not have. News travels nowhere\r\nfaster or surer than in prison. If Ruef bribes guards, the officials may\r\nnot know it, but the prisoners will. If Ruef may have smuggled sweets,\r\nthe other prisoner, whose every nerve-cell shrieks in agony for cocaine,\r\nbut who knows he will be thrown in the dungeon if he smuggles it, will\r\nhave no illusions about the smuggling privilege. If the very minions of\r\njustice do injustice, as between Abe Ruef and Convict No. 231,323, every\r\nman in that vast prison will be taught that he is the victim not of\r\njustice, but of force and favoritism. And if Ruef, at the expiration of\r\na bare year, were to be paroled out, every other convict, whose very\r\napplication can not be heard until he has served half his term, will\r\nknow that he is suffering the penalty, not of his crime, but of his\r\npoverty and friendlessness. Shall Abe Ruef be suffered to teach that\r\nlesson? Shall he corrupt San Quentin prison as he did San Francisco? Or\r\nshall there be at last one place found where even Abe Ruef gets exact\r\nand equal justice?\"\r\n\r\nRuef is getting equal justice at State prison, not because he corrupted\r\nSan Francisco, not because a jury of twelve citizens found him guilty,\r\nnot because seven out of eleven judges declared against him, but because\r\nthe political machine, of which Ruef was one of the most powerful\r\nleaders, has been broken in California. Under the old order, to have\r\nkept Ruef jailed would have been impossible.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [476] See Cal. App. Rpts., vol. 14, page 576.\r\n\r\n [478] Said the Sacramento Bee in an editorial article discussing\r\n       this order, the day after it was made public, January 24,\r\n       1911:\r\n\r\n       It cannot be denied that this order, by a bare majority of the\r\n       Supreme Court and--with the single exception of the Chief\r\n       Justice, by the three of its members least esteemed and\r\n       respected by the public--has excited disgust and exasperation\r\n       throughout California. There is a strong popular feeling and\r\n       belief that the Supreme Court should not thus have interposed\r\n       to save from punishment the most notorious scoundrel and\r\n       corruptionist in California, a man known to everybody as\r\n       having enriched himself by systematic grafting and by the\r\n       bribery of public servants in the interests of corporations, a\r\n       man with many indictments resting against him, but convicted\r\n       only on one.\r\n\r\n       \"What adds to this general disgust and indignation over the\r\n       Supreme Court's order is apprehension that the rehearing before\r\n       that tribunal may result in the grant of a new trial for Ruef,\r\n       a reversal which in all probability would be equivalent to a\r\n       final discharge. Such changes have taken place in San Francisco\r\n       in the last two years, especially in the office of the District\r\n       Attorney, that a new trial would have small chance of ending in\r\n       conviction.\r\n\r\n       \"No reasons are given by the Supreme Court for its order for a\r\n       rehearing, but presumably they are of a purely technical sort,\r\n       for the fact of Ruef's guilt was abundantly proved on the\r\n       trial.\"\r\n\r\n [479] The Cartwright resolution was in full as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"Whereas, The Supreme Court of this State on or about the 23rd\r\n       of January, 1911, rendered a decision in the case of the\r\n       People of the State of California vs. Abraham Ruef, in which\r\n       the defendant is granted a rehearing; and\r\n\r\n       \"Whereas, Various newspapers have published criticisms\r\n       condemning said decision, and intimating that the Justices\r\n       participating therein were controlled by corrupt and unworthy\r\n       motives; and\r\n\r\n       \"Whereas, The integrity of our courts has been frequently\r\n       assailed by public speakers and by many of our citizens, all\r\n       of which tends to destroy the confidence of The People in the\r\n       purity and integrity of our courts of justice; be it\r\n\r\n       \"Resolved, by the Senate, That the Assembly be requested to\r\n       appoint a committee of the Assembly, such committee to be\r\n       authorized, empowered and instructed to investigate the whole\r\n       subject matter and particularly to investigate said decision,\r\n       the grounds upon which the decision is based and the conduct\r\n       of the Justices of the Supreme Court in relation to said\r\n       decision, and that the committee report to the Assembly the\r\n       results of such investigation, with such recommendations as to\r\n       the committee may seem meet and proper in the premises; be it\r\n       further\r\n\r\n       \"Resolved, That said committee shall have power to summon\r\n       witnesses, and to send for persons and papers and to issue\r\n       subpoenaes and compel attendance of witnesses when necessary.\"\r\n\r\n [480] See Chapter IV.\r\n\r\n [481] This view was entirely justified by the outcome in the Coffey\r\n       case. Coffey was one of the boodle Supervisors who had at the\r\n       test refused \"to go back on his class.\" He was tried for\r\n       bribe-taking and convicted. In the Court of Appeal practically\r\n       the same points were raised in his favor as were raised in the\r\n       Ruef case. The Appellate Court refused to interfere. The\r\n       Supreme Court, by a three to four decision, granted Coffey a\r\n       rehearing and later a new trial. The line-up of the eleven\r\n       judges was the same in Coffey's case as in Ruef's--seven found\r\n       Coffey had had a fair trial; four found that he had not. The\r\n       four--under the rules of the legal game--were more potent than\r\n       the seven. The jury verdict was nullified. The indictments\r\n       against Coffey were finally dismissed. Had the Supreme Court's\r\n       order for a rehearing of the Ruef case stood, the outcome\r\n       would have unquestionably been the same.\r\n\r\n [482] Some of the ablest men in the State urged impeachment\r\n       proceedings. \"If the charges,\" said United States Senator John\r\n       D. Works in a letter to State Senator Hewitt, \"made against\r\n       Judge Henshaw by the Attorney-General of this State, under\r\n       oath, are true, why is it the Legislature of this State before\r\n       this has not commenced impeachment proceedings against him?\r\n\r\n       \"The legislature has no right to shrink from this duty and\r\n       responsibility and relieve itself from taking such a step by\r\n       relegating that duty and responsibility to The People of the\r\n       State by the enactment of recall legislation. If Judge\r\n       Henshaw, or any other judge, has violated his duty to the\r\n       State and betrayed his office as the charges made against him\r\n       indicate, the duty of the legislature is imperative, and that\r\n       duty should be performed without hesitation and without\r\n       delay.\"\r\n\r\n       Justice Henshaw, in discussing Judge Works' letter, in an\r\n       interview in the San Francisco Examiner, February 15, 1911, is\r\n       quoted as saying: \"All the charges made by Attorney General\r\n       Webb in his affidavit attacking the Ruef rehearing order of\r\n       January 30th are true. The orders were signed in the manner\r\n       stated and I told him so when he visited my office. There was\r\n       nothing unusual about it. It was done in accordance with the\r\n       usual practice of this court.\r\n\r\n       \"We seldom meet in session to sign the orders. There may be\r\n       twenty cases to be passed on in one week. Each Justice looks\r\n       them over at his leisure and signs what orders he agrees to.\r\n\r\n       \"I was out of the State, as Mr. Webb says, and at the time\r\n       that he says. I did not even imagine that there was a legal\r\n       point involved. The practice never has been questioned\r\n       before.\"\r\n\r\n [483] The following is from the Supreme Court decision revoking the\r\n       Ruef order for a rehearing (see California App. Reports, Vol.\r\n       14, page 576): \"The moment Justice Henshaw left the State, in\r\n       view of the authorities already referred to, he became unable\r\n       to exercise any judicial function as a Justice of the Supreme\r\n       Court, in this State or out of it, and this disability\r\n       continued during the whole period of his absence. During that\r\n       time his situation was the same as if he had absolutely ceased\r\n       to be a member of this court. It is true that there was a\r\n       suspension, only, of his judicial power, instead of a final\r\n       abrogation thereof, but the suspension, while it continued,\r\n       was as absolute in its effect on his judicial power as would\r\n       have been a complete vacancy in his office. Assent to or\r\n       concurrence in a decision or order of the court being the\r\n       exercise of a purely judicial function, his previous proposal\r\n       to concur in a proposed order, one that had not yet been made\r\n       and one that had not yet received the assent of other justices\r\n       making it an accomplished decision, temporarily ceased to be\r\n       effectual for any purpose, and so continued ineffectual for\r\n       any purpose during the whole period of his absence. Such\r\n       previously indicated willingness to concur could not\r\n       accomplish that which the absent justice himself could not\r\n       accomplish. The time having expired before he returned it\r\n       follows that he never concurred with even a single other\r\n       justice in the purported order. (1) Admittedly this order, if\r\n       it ever did become effectual, did not become so until January\r\n       22, 1911, when the fourth justice appended his name. At that\r\n       time, however, Justice Henshaw could not effectually join\r\n       therein, because of his absence from the State, and his\r\n       previously indicated willingness to join therein could have no\r\n       legal effect. The result is that only three justices of this\r\n       court concurred in the purported order, and as such order\r\n       could be made only by the concurrence of four justices, it was\r\n       ineffectual for any purpose and void.\"\r\n\r\n [484] Ford's term as prison director expired January 12, 1914. He\r\n       continued in office until his term had expired and his\r\n       successor had been appointed. After Ruef had confessed that\r\n       the trolley bribe money had come to him through Ford, the\r\n       Sacramento Bee of August 30, 1912, after reciting the\r\n       allegations of Ruef's confession, said:\r\n\r\n       \"There, in brief, is the tale which Abraham Ruef tells with\r\n       much particularity. It is now in order for the Board of Prison\r\n       Directors to ask the resignation of Prison Director Ford.\r\n\r\n       \"Undoubtedly, Governor Johnson would make a demand to that\r\n       effect were he in the State.\r\n\r\n       \"Much sorrow, if not sympathy, has been felt for Tirey L. Ford\r\n       all over California. The Bee has expressed some itself. The\r\n       feeling has been that a man of naturally fine principles and\r\n       honorable sentiments had been warped by his environments, and\r\n       had done under instructions that at which his better nature\r\n       rebelled.\r\n\r\n       \"It would be futile now to discuss what Tirey L. Ford should\r\n       have done and should not have done; or to declare that no\r\n       temptation should have led him to perform any other than legal\r\n       work for the United Railroads.\r\n\r\n       \"The Bee will say as little as it can say conscientiously\r\n       under the circumstances. Human nature is human nature the\r\n       world over. And The Bee men cannot forget the long, long years\r\n       of intimate friendship with and faith in Tirey L. Ford. But\r\n       every consideration of the eternal fitness of things demands\r\n       that he should no longer remain a member of the State Board of\r\n       Prison Directors.\"\r\n\r\n [485] The following is a fair sample of the articles descriptive of\r\n       Ruef's suffering in prison, which have been inflicted upon the\r\n       California public ever since Ruef donned stripes; it appeared\r\n       in The San Francisco Bulletin of December 21, 1912: \"Ruef is\r\n       an epicure. As discordant sounds do violence to the feelings\r\n       of a musician gifted with an exquisite ear, so coarse, badly\r\n       cooked or tasteless food does violence to the epicure who is\r\n       gifted with exquisite nerves for inhaling, tasting and\r\n       appreciating delicate flavors. The gastric juices of the\r\n       epicure cannot become freely active on mere hunger as with men\r\n       not so endowed. Digestion with the epicure must wait upon the\r\n       fine dictates of the palate; and a stomach so guarded cannot\r\n       wantonly change to an extreme opposite without material\r\n       suffering. To eat merely to be filled, to overeat, to eat\r\n       hurriedly, is for the epicure, as one epicure puts it, 'to\r\n       commit moral sins.' Ruef since his imprisonment has been\r\n       compelled to do all these things.\"\r\n\r\n [486] To this complaint of cruelty to Ruef, The Fresno Republican\r\n       made sharp answer: \"A visitor,\" said The Republican, \"smuggled\r\n       articles to Ruef--nothing more dangerous than sweet chocolate\r\n       and newspaper clippings, to be sure, but still a covert\r\n       violation of a necessary rule--so Ruef is deprived of visitors\r\n       and letters for two months, and the automatic application of a\r\n       general rule postpones his application for parole for six\r\n       months. Whereat there is wailing and woe, and the San\r\n       Francisco Call says that Ruef's friends regard it as\r\n       particularly unfortunate that he should be deprived of\r\n       visitors just at the time when a movement for his parole is\r\n       going on.\r\n\r\n       \"To all: Let us be sympathetic. Only let us make it general.\r\n       Ruef shall have his sweet chocolate. But all the other\r\n       prisoners shall have it too. Ruef shall sneak things into\r\n       prison, inside his blouse, by bribing the guards. But all the\r\n       other prisoners shall have all the like privileges, though it\r\n       is known that some of them would prefer dope, daggers and\r\n       dynamite to sweet chocolate.\"\r\n\r\n [487] Commenting upon this the Sacramento Bee, in its issue of\r\n       February 9, 1912, said: \"In an effort to create sympathy for\r\n       Abraham Ruef, a story was originated at San Francisco, and has\r\n       found wide publicity as news, that the aged mother of the\r\n       felon has been kept in ignorance of his imprisonment, and does\r\n       not even know of his conviction for bribery.\r\n\r\n       \"Yet letters purporting to come from and to be signed by\r\n       Ruef's mother, and pleading for his parole, have been received\r\n       by The Bee and other newspapers for months past. Either these\r\n       letters were forgeries and fabrications, or this tale of the\r\n       mother's ignorance of Ruef's confinement is mere fiction.\r\n\r\n       \"In either case a contemptible trick has been played by some\r\n       agency both active and unscrupulous in seeking to promote\r\n       Ruef's release. After this the public and the newspapers may\r\n       well be suspicious of sympathetic stories respecting Ruef and\r\n       his confinement. If he is personally responsible for the\r\n       effort to exploit his mother in the manner here related, he is\r\n       even a more despicable specimen of humanity than the known\r\n       facts of his career would indicate.\"\r\n\r\n [488] Older, in a letter to Dr. S. W. Hopkins, of Lodi, gives his\r\n       reasons for working for Ruef's release as follows:\r\n\r\n       \"San Francisco, September 25, 1911. Dr. S. W. Hopkins,\r\n       President Board of Health, Lodi, Cal. Dear Sir: If you read my\r\n       article in the Survey, I think there is much in it that you\r\n       did not understand. Perhaps I did not make myself clear. I\r\n       tried to. I wanted those who read the Survey article to\r\n       believe that I at least no longer think we are going to better\r\n       the world by punishing men individually. I do not feel that it\r\n       is good for people or for the editor of the Pacific Christian\r\n       to want vengeance administered to our brothers and sisters. I\r\n       think vengeance, and by vengeance I mean punishment, makes us\r\n       all worse rather than better. I have asked for mercy for Ruef\r\n       because I felt that I, above all others, had done most to\r\n       bring about his downfall. If you have followed the long fight\r\n       the Bulletin has made during the past eight or nine years, you\r\n       will recall that I was fighting Ruef long years before the\r\n       city woke up. You will also recall that I attacked him\r\n       bitterly with all the invectives that I could personally\r\n       command, and all that I could hire. I cartooned him in\r\n       stripes. I described him on his way to San Quentin; told how I\r\n       thought he would act en route, and what his manner would be\r\n       when the barber shaved his head, and how he would feel when\r\n       locked up in a cell. I was vindictive, unscrupulous, savage. I\r\n       went to Washington and enlisted Heney in the fight. Burns\r\n       came, and Spreckels joined in the chase. Then I pursued with\r\n       the same relentless spirit in the wake of these men. At last,\r\n       after eight years of a man-hunting and man-hating debauch,\r\n       Ruef crossed over and became what I had wanted him to be, what\r\n       I had longed and dreamed that he might be--a convict, stripped\r\n       of his citizenship, stripped of everything society values\r\n       except the remnant of an ill-gotten fortune. It was then I\r\n       said to myself: 'I have got him. He is in stripes. He is in a\r\n       cell. His head is shaved. He is in tears. He is helpless,\r\n       beaten, chained--killed, so far as his old life is concerned.\r\n       You have won. How do you like your victory? Do you enjoy the\r\n       picture now that it is complete? You painted it. Every savage\r\n       instinct in your nature is expressed on the canvas.'\r\n\r\n       \"My soul revolted. I thought over my own life and the many\r\n       unworthy things I had done to others, the injustice, the\r\n       wrongs I had been guilty of, the human hearts I had wantonly\r\n       hurt, the sorrow I had caused, the half-truths I had told, and\r\n       the mitigating truths I had withheld, the lies I had allowed\r\n       to go undenied. And then I saw myself also stripped, that is,\r\n       stripped of all pretense, sham, self-righteousness, holding\r\n       the key to another man's cell. I dropped the key. I never want\r\n       to see it again. Let it be taken up and held by those who feel\r\n       they are justified in holding it. I want no more jail keys.\r\n       For the rest of my life I want to get a little nearer to the\r\n       forgiving spirit that Christ expressed.\r\n\r\n       \"Isn't what I am accusing myself of, true of all of us? Think\r\n       it over. Think of your own life. Think of the lives of those\r\n       around you, and see if you cannot discern that we are all\r\n       guilty. And then think whether or not you believe that society\r\n       will be benefited by denying Ruef a parole, which only gives\r\n       him a half liberty and still holds him under the restrictions\r\n       of the prison until his term is finished.\r\n\r\n       \"I am surprised at the tone of the article you sent me,\r\n       published in the Pacific Christian. It reads like a chapter\r\n       out of the Old Testament rather than the New. But I fear that\r\n       the world is being governed more upon the lines of the Old\r\n       Testament than the New. I agree with the article about the\r\n       young men who have been sent to prison for years. I would\r\n       release them all if I could. But I can't. I can't even release\r\n       Ruef, because society has not advanced far enough to make it\r\n       possible. But I can at least be true to myself and express\r\n       what I honestly feel.\r\n\r\n       \"I wish as a favor to me that you would send a copy of this\r\n       letter to the Pacific Christian, as I am leaving for the East\r\n       and will not have time. I should like them to know what I am\r\n       writing you. Sincerely yours,\r\n                                                  \"Fremont Older.\"\r\n\r\n [489] The San Jose Mercury, controlled by Congressman E. A. Hayes,\r\n       in its issue of September 22, 1911, published one of these\r\n       Ruef campaign articles. The following description of Ruef\r\n       occurs:\r\n\r\n       \"Not many months have gone since Ruef found domicile in States\r\n       prison. But what changes Time has wrought in that brief\r\n       period. The little man sits in his cell, lonely and solemn, as\r\n       he meditates on the singularities of mankind. With no\r\n       bitterness in his soul, without a thought of revenge twisting\r\n       his sense of peace and good will toward man, he passes the\r\n       time planning the comforts of his fellow unfortunates and\r\n       reading and rereading the letters that come so regularly from\r\n       the loved ones whose burdens he so gladly carried and to whose\r\n       joy he so gladly contributed. He is neither unhappy nor\r\n       without hope.\"\r\n\r\n       The same article contains another word picture--of Francis J.\r\n       Heney. It reads:\r\n\r\n       \"But if Older has turned 'right about face,' Heney, the other\r\n       member of the firm, has not. He remains the unforgiving,\r\n       snarling, short-haired bulldog, with his hand against every\r\n       man, and every man's hand against him.\"\r\n\r\n       Such is the character of the publicity campaign to release\r\n       Ruef from prison.\r\n\r\n [490] When in 1914 Governor Johnson became candidate for\r\n       re-election, extraordinary efforts were made to compel him to\r\n       pardon, or to consent to the release of Ruef on parole. So\r\n       persistent were Ruef advocates, that the Governor found it\r\n       necessary to issue a statement of his position regarding Ruef.\r\n       That statement will be found in full on page xxviii of the\r\n       Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n                              CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the McCarthy-Fickert election there were rumors that the graft\r\ndefense, flushed with its successes in the overthrow of the prosecution,\r\nwould resort to reprisals, by singling out persons prominent in the\r\nmovement to enforce the law, for trumped-up charges and possible\r\nindictment. But aside from an abortive attempt to make it appear that\r\nformer Supervisor Gallagher had fled the State at the behest of William\r\nJ. Burns, reprisals of this nature were not attempted.\r\n\r\nThe reprisals came in more subtle form. Members of the Oliver Grand Jury\r\nwhich had brought the indictments against Ruef and his associates, found\r\nthemselves marked men in business, political and social circles. A\r\nmember of the faculty of the State University who had been active in\r\ndefending the cause of the prosecution, found his salary remaining\r\npractically stationary, while his associates received material advances.\r\nWhen the directorate of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition\r\nCompany was formed, financiers who had supported the prosecution found\r\nthemselves barred from directorships. It may be said, however, that the\r\ngraft defense was well represented, one of the Exposition directors at\r\nleast, Thornwall Mullally, having been one of those indicted in the\r\ngraft cases.\r\n\r\nWhen the suggestion was made that James D. Phelan be made Pacific Coast\r\nrepresentative in President Wilson's cabinet, at once the graft defense\r\npack was on his track, openly naming Mr. Phelan's assistance to the\r\nprosecution cause as reason sufficient why he should not be given the\r\ncabinet appointment.[491]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, all danger of confinement in State prison being gone,\r\nthe graft defense, through its various newspapers, urged incessantly\r\nthat the past be forgotten, that San Francisco interests get together\r\nfor the good of San Francisco. But this \"getting together\" meant the\r\nbanishing from political, social, and, as far as practical, business\r\ncircles, all who had sided with the prosecution, thereby giving control\r\nof all activities to sympathizers with the graft defense.\r\n\r\nThis is well recognized throughout the State, and the exclusive\r\n\"get-together\" movements are received with general ridicule.[492] The\r\ngraft defense does not stand well in California. The \"vindication\" that\r\nwas heralded throughout the country when the indictments were dismissed\r\nhas not been accepted in California as generally as those most\r\nimmediately affected could have wished.\r\n\r\nThen again, the corporations involved in the scandals, have a heritage\r\nfrom the graft defense which seems destined to bring confusion upon them\r\nat every turn of their development. Late in 1912, for example, a year\r\nand a half after the trolley-graft indictments were dismissed, the\r\nUnited Railroads attempted readjustment of its bonded indebtedness. This\r\ncould be done only with the consent of the State Railroad Commission.\r\nThe Commission, willing to allow any proper adjustment upon competent\r\nshowing, asked that the corporation's books be produced. The books had,\r\nduring the days of the prosecution, been sent out of the State. The\r\nUnited Railroads could not produce the books, and consent to its\r\npetition to readjust its financial affairs was withheld until the books\r\nshould be forthcoming. Unofficial assurance was given officials of the\r\ncorporation that investigation would not be made of its graft defense\r\nexpenditures,[493] nor of any expenditures involved in the scandal of\r\nthe alleged bribe-giving. But apparently even this assurance did not\r\nsatisfy those connected with the United Railroads whose reputations, at\r\nleast, were at stake.[494] The company's books were not opened for the\r\nCommission's inspection.\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest sufferer from the graft defense was San Francisco.\r\nHere it was demonstrated that even with a District Attorney intent upon\r\nthe discharge of his sworn duty, with upright trial judges on the bench,\r\nthe machinery of the criminal law broke down when men with practically\r\nunlimited means were brought to bar. To accomplish this required a four\r\nyears' contest, in which community resistance to political corruption was\r\novercome, the people misled, their minds poisoned against that which is\r\nwholesome, and made tolerant of that which is base and bad.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy effects of this are just beginning to be understood. The\r\nevil of the graft defense will live long in San Francisco after the\r\ndismissal of the indictments. Four years after the defeat of the Graft\r\nProsecution, Referendum petitions against State laws have been forged in\r\nSan Francisco, and the laws, which had been passed by the State\r\nLegislature and signed by the Governor, have been delayed from going\r\ninto effect for nearly two years, because of the forgeries. And yet,\r\nalthough the forgers are known, their prosecution, except in one\r\ninstance, has not even been attempted. Governor Johnson has called the\r\nattention of the Attorney-General of the State to this condition, and\r\nhas urged him to undertake the prosecution of these forgery cases.\r\n\r\nTenderloin interests at San Francisco now indicate even greater power in\r\nthe community than they exerted during the worst days of Ruef-Schmitz\r\nregime. The same is in a measure true of the public service\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\nWhen District Attorney Langdon announced in 1906 that public-spirited\r\ncitizens would assist in meeting the expenses of running to earth the\r\ncorruptionists that had San Francisco by the throat, prospect of\r\nlaw-enforcement through the regular channels was welcomed, and ugly talk\r\nof lynch-law prevalent at the time, ceased. The success of the graft\r\ndefense meant that the efforts to reach the corrupters of the municipal\r\ngovernment through the courts had failed. San Francisco was beaten. In\r\nthe community's present inability to protect itself against the\r\nencroachments of the public service corporations, and to correct vice\r\nconditions which are far worse than in the worst days of the\r\nSchmitz-Ruef regime, the effects of that beating are seen. San Francisco\r\nwill be long in recovering from the effects of her defeat. Because of\r\nthe results of it, she finds herself handicapped in her race for Pacific\r\nCoast supremacy with Los Angeles, Seattle and even Oakland. And the\r\nprospects are at the close of the year 1914, that the burden of this\r\nhandicap will be increased before it is diminished. In the old days an\r\ninvading army conquered a city and sacked it. The System conquered San\r\nFrancisco and is exploiting it.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the graft prosecution was a defeat for San Francisco\r\nalone. It was not a defeat for the State of California.\r\n\r\nThe evil influence of the graft defense did not reach beyond the\r\nmetropolis. On the contrary, the success of the defense uncovered for\r\nthe whole State the actual political conditions under which all\r\nCalifornia was laboring.\r\n\r\nThe registration of 47,945 Republicans at San Francisco to defeat Heney\r\nat the primaries, and the Republican vote of 13,766 at the final\r\nelection, demonstrated the emptiness of partisan pretense. One of the\r\nimmediate results was a uniting of all good citizens regardless of\r\npolitical affiliations for good government, and Hiram W. Johnson,\r\nHeney's associate in the graft trials, was in 1910, elected Governor of\r\nCalifornia. Four years later, James D. Phelan, Rudolph Spreckels's\r\nassociate in financing the graft prosecution, was elected United States\r\nSenator from California, while Judge Lawlor was that year elected to the\r\nState Supreme Bench. Judge Dunne was in 1914 re-elected to the Superior\r\nBench to serve until 1920.\r\n\r\nDecisions from the higher courts--to the lay mind astonishing; to\r\nauthorities on questions of law, vicious and unwarranted--which set free\r\nmen who had been convicted of dangerous felonies; scandals which grew\r\nout of these decisions; the public's demonstrated helplessness against\r\nthem, aroused the State. By overwhelming vote California added to her\r\nConstitution a provision under which The People may by direct vote\r\nremove a corrupt or incompetent judge from the bench.\r\n\r\nThe public had assumed that men trapped in bribe-giving would be\r\nmeasured by a fixed rule of the law, and their proper punishment in due\r\ncourse be meted out to them. That anything else could be had not\r\noccurred to the average citizen.\r\n\r\nBut the astonishing performances at the graft trials, the extraordinary\r\nanti-prosecution publicity campaign, and, finally, the amazing technical\r\ndefense, and the failure of the graft defendants to take the stand and\r\nmanfully deny under oath the charges brought against them, opened the\r\neyes of the public to the fact that the methods of criminal procedure\r\nwere sadly inadequate.\r\n\r\nAnd the further fact was emphasized that while the weak points in the\r\nmethods of bringing an offender to punishment could be used to advantage\r\nby the rich man, they were unavailable to the man without the means to\r\nemploy a lawyer to present the technicalities governing his case.\r\n\r\nOut of this conviction, came agitation for reform of the methods of\r\ncriminal procedure. An elaborate plan for such reform was presented to\r\nthe 1909 Legislature.[495] But the machine element controlled the\r\ncommittee organization of both houses, and the measures were defeated.\r\n\r\nAt the 1911 session of the Legislature, after Johnson had been elected\r\nGovernor, measures for the reform of the criminal procedure similar to\r\nthose defeated by indirection at the 1909 session, were introduced. Many\r\nof them became laws. But, unfortunately, certain labor leaders were made\r\nto believe that the measures were aimed at Labor. This led to\r\nopposition which resulted in the defeat of several of the proposed\r\nreforms.\r\n\r\nOne important constitutional amendment was, however, presented to the\r\npeople that goes far toward correcting the abuses which attended the\r\ngraft trials. This amendment provides that \"no judgment shall be set\r\naside, or new trial granted in any criminal case on the ground of\r\nmisdirection of the jury or the improper admission or rejection of\r\nevidence, or for error as to any matter of pleading or procedure,\r\nunless, after an examination of the entire cause including the evidence,\r\nthe court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has\r\nresulted in a miscarriage of justice.\"\r\n\r\nNot a vote was cast against this amendment in either house of the\r\nLegislature. The feeling against the use of trifling technicalities for\r\nthe release of convicted criminals which the graft cases had displayed\r\nso glaringly, was shown in the popular vote on this amendment; 195,449\r\nvoted for the amendment, while only 53,958 voted against it.[496]\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco graft prosecution succeeded in sending but one of the\r\ncorrupters of the municipal government to State prison. He, too, would\r\nin all probability have escaped imprisonment but for the absence from\r\nthe State of a single member of the Supreme Court at a critical moment.\r\n\r\nBut the graft prosecution did something infinitely more important than\r\nthe sending of a few corruptionists to cell and stripes. It awakened a\r\nState to its helplessness against a corrupt system. The People arose in\r\nrebellion against the \"System,\" and is laboring to throw the \"System\"\r\noff.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 and 1911 a political revolution was worked in California.\r\n\r\nBut the revolution had its beginning back in 1906, when Rudolph\r\nSpreckels guaranteed the expenses of the prosecution of the corrupters\r\nof the municipal government of San Francisco, and Francis J. Heney, as\r\nhis share in the campaign, pledged his services.\r\n\r\nHad there been no San Francisco graft prosecution, there would, in 1910,\r\nhave been no successful political uprising in California. Hiram W.\r\nJohnson would not have been a candidate for Governor. The accomplished\r\nreforms which are the boast of the State, and the models which other\r\nStates are adopting, would still be the unrealized dreams of\r\n\"reformers.\" The \"System\" would still be in the saddle.\r\n\r\nThe graft defense has left its mark of ill upon San Francisco. That city\r\nhas borne the brunt of the injury because of it.\r\n\r\nThe graft prosecution, by forcing the \"System\" out in the open, where\r\nall its power for evil can be seen, worked California inestimable good.\r\nAnd here, San Francisco, in common with the whole State, gains also.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [491] The San Francisco Argonaut, one of the principal apologists\r\n       for the Graft Defense, in its issue of November 23, 1912, said\r\n       of the suggestion of Mr. Phelan's name for the cabinet:\r\n       \"Ex-Mayor Phelan, of San Francisco, would be in line for\r\n       cabinet honors if our local war of the roses were not so\r\n       recent and if its unfragrant memories and resentments could be\r\n       set aside. But this is not yet.\"\r\n\r\n [492] The Fresno Republican in its issue of December 7, 1912, pays\r\n       the following tribute to the graft defense's \"get-together\"\r\n       plans:\r\n\r\n       \"They are going to hold a 'burn the hammer' celebration in San\r\n       Francisco on New Year's eve, for the cremation of knocking.\r\n\r\n       \"It is a good idea, and one worth going the limit on. By all\r\n       means, burn the hammers! But the only effectual way to get that\r\n       done is for each fellow to burn his own. Unfortunately, when we\r\n       begin knocking the knockers, the hammer we are after is usually\r\n       the one with which the other fellow knocks us. There is no\r\n       boosting way to dispose of the other fellow's hammer. If we go\r\n       after it, we knock it, to the further multiplication of\r\n       knocking. But if we begin at the other end, with our own\r\n       hammer, that is real boosting. Besides, it gets the thing done.\r\n       What we do to the other fellow's hammer may not succeed, and if\r\n       it does, it is merely more knocking. But when we burn or bury\r\n       our own, then we know that at least our part of the knocking is\r\n       ended.\r\n\r\n       \"The purpose of the 'burn the hammer,' or 'get-together,' is,\r\n       of course, to bridge the breach left by the Graft Prosecutions.\r\n       And to this end we suggest that----\r\n\r\n       \"The higher-ups of the Pacific Union Club give a dinner at\r\n       which Francis J. Heney and Rudolph Spreckels are the guests of\r\n       honor.\r\n\r\n       \"The directors of the Panama-Pacific Exposition elect James D.\r\n       Phelan one of their number.\r\n\r\n       \"William H.

Since they\r\n       shout the loudest for 'harmony,' presumably they are the ones\r\n       who want it. The way to get it is first to put away their own\r\n       implements of discord. And no better pledges of intent to do\r\n       this could be conceived than are contained in the suggestions\r\n       here offered.\"\r\n\r\n [493] The machine-free press of the State, however, openly insisted\r\n       that it would be a good thing if full publicity of the United\r\n       Railroads expenditures could be had.\r\n\r\n       \"What the missing books might contain of an interesting sort,\"\r\n       said The Sacramento Bee in discussing the incident, \"may be\r\n       gathered from a 'list of expenses' submitted by Calhoun in\r\n       lieu of the books, including an item of $314,000 to Patrick\r\n       Calhoun for 'services rendered.'\r\n\r\n       \"The character of these 'services' may be surmised by anybody\r\n       familiar with the history of the recent bribery and Graft\r\n       Prosecutions in San Francisco. But surely the public and the\r\n       stockholders and creditors of the United Railroads are entitled\r\n       to specifications.\r\n\r\n       \"It is largely that corporations may not bribe in secure\r\n       secrecy, or otherwise commit criminal acts without detection,\r\n       that the Progressive states are bringing them under strict\r\n       regulation and inspection by proper authority.\"\r\n\r\n [494] The Railroad Commission of California, in its Decision 1536,\r\n       made May 22, 1914, held \"that the methods pursued by the\r\n       former officials of applicant in handling the funds in their\r\n       care amounts to nothing more than a fraud, not only upon the\r\n       public forced to use an inadequate and unserviceable system,\r\n       but upon the bond and note holders of such company.\"\r\n\r\n       Of one transaction, in which President Calhoun was permitted\r\n       to take $1,096,000 of the company's funds, which it was\r\n       claimed he had invested in a land project in Solano, in which\r\n       Mr. Calhoun was interested, the Commission said:\r\n\r\n       \"No proof was made to this Commission that any part of this\r\n       money was actually invested in the so-called Solano project,\r\n       but we are confronted by the fact that Mr. Calhoun, under\r\n       authority of the board of directors, and ratified by the\r\n       stockholders, took from the treasury of applicant $1,096,000,\r\n       and whether he invested it in the Solano project or not is\r\n       unimportant in the consideration of this railroad company as a\r\n       public utility.\r\n\r\n       \"It seems that upon the taking of office by Mr. Jesse\r\n       Lilienthal, the present president of the railroad company, Mr.\r\n       Calhoun was forced to execute a promissory note for $1,096,000,\r\n       payable one day after date, in favor of the railroad company,\r\n       secured by stock of the Solano project; but the judgment of the\r\n       value of this promissory note is perhaps best indicated by the\r\n       fact that Mr. Lilienthal immediately wrote this note down in\r\n       the books of the company as of a value of $1.00.\r\n\r\n       \"We hesitate to put in words a proper characterization of this\r\n       transaction. In plain terms, Mr. Calhoun took from the funds of\r\n       this public utility corporation over $1,000,000, when every\r\n       available dollar was sorely needed properly to increase the\r\n       facilities of this company so as to serve the community of San\r\n       Francisco, and at a time when this same company was urging upon\r\n       this Commission the necessity of issuing further bonds to pay\r\n       off maturing obligations, and also at a time when admittedly\r\n       the outstanding obligations could not be paid at maturity by\r\n       approximately $20,000,000.\"\r\n\r\n       This enormous sum had been taken in gold at various times,\r\n       ranging in amounts from $250 to $85,000.\r\n\r\n [495] These measures are described in \"The Story of the California\r\n       Legislature of 1909.\" The methods employed to defeat them were\r\n       told in detail. See chapter \"Defeat of the Commonwealth Club\r\n       Bills.\"\r\n\r\n [496] Under the provisions of measures which became laws at the 1911\r\n       session, it is held that it will be impossible hereafter to put\r\n       grand jurors on trial as was done in the San Francisco graft\r\n       cases. Hereafter, too, an indictment or information may be\r\n       amended by the District Attorney without leave of the Court at\r\n       any time before the defendant pleads; and at any time\r\n       thereafter in the discretion of the Court where it can be done\r\n       without prejudice to the substantial rights of the defendant.\r\n\r\n       Another measure takes from a witness his privilege of refusing\r\n       to give testimony on the grounds that it may incriminate him.\r\n       The witness is safeguarded, however, by a provision that he\r\n       shall not be liable thereafter to prosecution nor punishment\r\n       with respect to the offense regarding which such testimony is\r\n       given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDIX\r\n\r\n  JUDGE LAWLOR'S RULING ON MOTION TO DISMISS GRAFT CASES, AUGUST 3, 1910.\r\n\r\nOn April 25th, 1910, an application was made by Patrick Calhoun, Tirey\r\nL. Ford, Thornwell Mullally and William M. Abbott to dismiss the\r\nindictments against them. The application is before the Court at this\r\ntime for consideration.\r\n\r\nWhen the defendants pleaded not guilty they exercised their statutory\r\nright and each demanded severance from each other and from their\r\nco-defendants, Abraham Ruef and Eugene E. Schmitz. (Sec. 1098 Penal\r\nCode.) There have been five trials--three of Tirey L. Ford and one each\r\nof Abraham Ruef and Patrick Calhoun.\r\n\r\nThe second trial of Patrick Calhoun was commenced on July 19th, 1909\r\n(case No. 1437). Owing to the illness of one of his counsel the trial\r\nwas suspended on August 16th, 1909, and resumed on September 30th, 1909.\r\nOn the following day the trial was ordered continued until November\r\n15th, 1909, on motion of the defendant, upon the ground of the pendency\r\nof a municipal campaign.\r\n\r\nOn January 8th, 1910, Mr. Charles M. Fickert assumed the office of\r\nDistrict Attorney.\r\n\r\nOn February 7th, 1910, the District Attorney moved the Court to dismiss\r\nthe remaining charges against these defendants (Sec. 1385 Penal Code),\r\nwhich motion was by the Court ordered denied. (Sec. 7, Art. I, and Sec.\r\n19, Art. VI of the Constitution; Secs. 1041, 1042, 1126, 1385, 1386 and\r\n1387 Penal Code.)\r\n\r\nOn February 14th, 1910, the parties announced that they were ready to\r\nresume the trial in case No. 1437 against Patrick Calhoun, but the Court\r\ncontinued the case for trial until February 17th, 1910. On the last\r\nnamed day the cause was ordered continued for trial until April 25th,\r\n1910.\r\n\r\nOn April 25th, 1910, the four defendants interposed a motion to dismiss\r\nthe remaining indictments against them. The further hearing of the\r\nmotion was continued until July 29th, 1910. On the latter day the causes\r\nwere continued until this time.\r\n\r\nTwo things are chiefly responsible for the Court's action in respect to\r\nthe remaining indictments since the District Attorney moved to dismiss\r\nthem on February 7th, 1910--first, the Court's apprehensions based on\r\nthe declared attitude of the said District Attorney toward the remaining\r\nindictments, and, second, the absence from the State of James L.\r\nGallagher, a material and indispensable witness in the said causes. The\r\nsecond reason will now be considered.\r\n\r\nIt was the theory of the People in the five trials referred to that\r\nAbraham Ruef represented the defendants in the alleged bribery of the\r\nmembers of the Board of Supervisors, and that James L. Gallagher, one of\r\nits members, in turn represented Abraham Ruef in the transactions. In\r\nthis way the Court is able to determine that the testimony of this\r\nwitness is material, and now holds, as a matter of law, that unless\r\nadditional testimony is produced, it is indispensable to the\r\nestablishment of the res gestae.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of December, 1909, it became known that the witness\r\nhad departed from the State. Up to the present time it has not been\r\nshown whether he had been formally subpoenaed or was otherwise under the\r\nauthority of the Court to appear as a witness in the trials of the\r\nremaining indictments. If he is subject to the authority of the Court in\r\nany of these cases his absence would constitute a criminal contempt, and\r\nhe could be extradited from any other State having provisions of law\r\nsimilar to those of this State. (Sub. 4, Sec. 166, and Sec. 1548 Penal\r\nCode.)\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be proper to point out that practically ever\r\nsince issue was joined on these indictments they have been on the\r\ncalendar for trial, and that during the trials referred to the cases not\r\nactually on trial were from time to time called and the witnesses\r\nadmonished by the Court to appear on the deferred date. But it has not\r\nbeen ascertained whether on this manner the missing witness has been so\r\nadmonished to appear so far as the remaining indictments are concerned.\r\n\r\nIn the month of January, 1910, the Court directed that all persons who\r\ncould give testimony concerning the absence of the witness be\r\nsubpoenaed. On January 24th, 1910, the first hearing was had, and on\r\nseveral occasions thereafter witnesses have been orally examined on the\r\nsubject. From this oral testimony it is difficult to determine the\r\nintentions of the witness concerning his departure from and his return\r\nto the State. It seems that in the latter part of November, 1909, he\r\nleft for Europe, accompanied by his wife. Robert F. Gallagher, a brother\r\nof the witness, testified in effect that the witness never stated he\r\nintended to absent himself as a witness in the graft cases and made no\r\nsuggestion of that nature; that he, Robert F. Gallagher, gained no such\r\nimpression from anything he did say, except that it was a disagreeable\r\nsituation for him to be a witness; and that their talk proceeded along\r\nthe line that there was not going to be any future trial in the graft\r\nprosecution. This brother testified further:\r\n\r\n\"He did state on one occasion something to the effect that Burns had\r\ndisappeared and that Heney had disappeared and that there wasn't any\r\nprosecution; that the incoming District Attorney would not certainly be\r\nin earnest in the prosecution.\"\r\n\r\nOther witnesses testified to a variety of facts touching the departure\r\nof the witness from San Francisco and his declarations on the general\r\nsubject. Dr. Alexander Warner gave testimony to the effect that he went\r\nto Europe on an Atlantic steamer with the witness and his wife. Thomas\r\nJ. Gallagher, another brother, among other things quoted the witness to\r\nthe effect that he was going to Europe, that he might settle in an\r\neastern State, that he made no secret of his purpose, and that William\r\nJ. Burns, special agent of the former administration in the District\r\nAttorney's office, knew of his intention to leave. Nothing definite\r\nappears in the oral showing concerning his intentions on the subject of\r\nhis return, and so far as that showing is concerned the point is more or\r\nless involved in conjecture. But on July 29th, 1910, Frederick L. Berry,\r\nthe Assistant District Attorney, assigned to this department of the\r\nCourt, filed an affidavit embodying clippings from the local newspapers\r\nof the previous month, which state that the witness was, at the time the\r\narticles were written, in Vancouver, B. C. From these clippings it\r\nappears that the witness intended to permanently locate in Vancouver.\r\nThe only tangible evidence from the witness himself, however, is found\r\nin his letter to Thomas J. Gallagher under date of June 29th, 1910, in\r\nwhich this excerpt appears:\r\n\r\n\"In reply to your inquiry I cannot state when I shall return to San\r\nFrancisco, if at all. I may remain here.\"\r\n\r\nIn my judgment a review of the showing up to this time leads to the\r\ninference that the witness left this jurisdiction and is remaining away\r\nbecause of some form of understanding or agreement. The circumstances\r\nunder which he left California clearly show that he was acting\r\nguardedly, notwithstanding the testimony, which there is no reason to\r\ndoubt, that he informed several persons of his intention to take a trip.\r\nWhen the quoted statement of Robert F. Gallagher was first made I was\r\ndisposed to assume that the witness left the State principally because\r\nhe believed the prosecution was at an end, and that he made his plans\r\nquietly so that the step would not occasion comment. In other words,\r\nthat he did not believe there would be any further attempt to prosecute\r\nthe so-called graft cases. But from a study of the entire showing I\r\ncannot adhere to that theory. I repeat that up to the time his presence\r\nwas discovered in Vancouver, the showing was uncertain as to whether he\r\nreally intended to return to California, and if so, when he would\r\nreturn. It was to be seen that the action of the Court would be\r\ninfluenced by this uncertainty, so when the exigencies of the situation\r\ncalled for a definite showing as to the witness' intentions, he seems to\r\nsuddenly appear in Vancouver, where, under the treaty conditions, he\r\nwould be safe from extradition, and is promptly discovered by the\r\nreporter of a New York paper. In the clippings his quoted statements on\r\nthe subject of his intentions are unequivocal. He is to make his home in\r\nVancouver. But his personal communication to Thomas J. Gallagher,\r\nalready referred to, which he probably realized would be produced in\r\nCourt, is significant in tenor and he is apparently less certain of his\r\nintentions. This would tend to make his future action consistent should\r\nhe hereafter return to California. From the entire showing I do not\r\nentertain any serious doubt as to what his real purpose is. I am\r\ninclined to believe that when the necessity for his presence as a\r\nwitness has passed he will return. To entertain any other view, or be in\r\nserious doubt on the point, is to ignore the inherent probabilities of\r\nthe showing and to deny a fair consideration to the known history of\r\nthis litigation.\r\n\r\nNow, it must follow that if the witness has left and is remaining away\r\nfrom the State because of an arrangement of some nature affecting these\r\ncases, the responsibility for his absence should be placed where it\r\nbelongs. On April 25th, 1910, the District Attorney stated to the Court:\r\n\r\n\"... and it appearing also that James L. Gallagher left with the consent\r\nand connivance of those who had preceded me in office, I at this time do\r\nnot wish to assume any responsibility for his disappearance. Whether he\r\nshall return or not I cannot say. Some of the witnesses who were called\r\nhere testified that he went away with the intent and with the purpose of\r\nembarrassing my administration and that he was supposed to keep away\r\nuntil such time as certain persons would request his return....\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing fairly states the position of the District Attorney on\r\nthis point, as repeatedly expressed in Court since he first moved the\r\ndismissal of these indictments. If the charge that the former\r\nadministration entered into a bargain with the witness to default be\r\ntrue, there would be no alternative but to dismiss the indictments\r\nwithout delay. But I have found no evidence in the showing tending to\r\nsupport so grave a charge, and upon sound reasoning it would seem to be\r\nopposed to every reasonable probability. According to the showing,\r\nWilliam J. Burns left the State about three weeks in advance of the\r\nwitness, and, so far as the Court is advised, he has not since been in\r\nthe State. That the former administration may have distrusted the\r\nofficial intentions of the District Attorney toward these indictments\r\nmight be assumed from all the surrounding circumstances. But it does not\r\nseem probable that the former administration would induce a material and\r\nindispensable witness to leave the State and thereby make it easy for\r\nthe District Attorney to secure a result which otherwise might entail\r\nserious embarrassment. So far as the showing is concerned there is no\r\ntangible proof tending to support the charge of the District Attorney,\r\nnor is there any proof which would justify such an inference.\r\n\r\nNor, on the other hand, do I find any formal evidence in the showing\r\nwhich tends to bring the responsibility for the disappearance of the\r\nwitness home to these defendants. In the absence of tangible proof\r\nneither side should be charged with so grave an act. But if there has\r\nbeen complicity on the part of either of the parties, every effort\r\nshould be made before disposing of these cases finally to establish the\r\nfacts. It has been pointed out that if the former administration entered\r\ninto a bargain with the witness looking to his absence, the application\r\nshould be granted without delay. And clearly, if the defendants are\r\nresponsible for the absence of the witness, under a familiar maxim of\r\nthe law, the application should be promptly denied. (Sec. 3517 Civil\r\nCode.)\r\n\r\nThere being no tangible proof, therefore, before the Court, of the\r\ncomplicity of the parties, should the pending application be granted at\r\nthis time?\r\n\r\nA person accused of crime is entitled to a speedy trial. (Sec. 13, Art.\r\nI, Const.)\r\n\r\nThis fundamental right has been made the subject of statutory provision.\r\nThe second subdivision of Section 1382 of the Penal Code provides that:\r\n\r\n\"=Unless good cause to the contrary is shown=, the court must order the\r\nprosecution to be dismissed if the indictment is not brought to trial\r\nwithin sixty days after the filing thereof.\"\r\n\r\nMore than sixty days have run in favor of this application, and the\r\nquestion presented at this time is whether the showing touching the\r\nabsence of James L. Gallagher shall constitute \"good cause\" within the\r\nmeaning of the law. This term must be construed and applied according to\r\nthe peculiar circumstances of each case. It should be interpreted so\r\nthat the rights of both parties shall be equally recognized. The absence\r\nof a material and indispensable witness for the People would, under\r\nproper circumstances, constitute good cause, provided that good faith\r\nand diligence are shown in the effort to produce the witness. In re\r\nBergerow (133 Cal., 349) is a leading authority on this question and is\r\nalmost invariably cited in support of applications of this character. It\r\nis proper to point out that in the prevailing opinion the Court\r\nstudiously eliminates from the pertinency of the authority the absence\r\nor illness of a witness for the prosecution.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion I have reached is that under the law, and the surrounding\r\ncircumstances, including the recent action of the witness, that another\r\nreasonable continuance should be directed in order, if possible, that\r\nthe duty of the Court in the premises shall be rendered more clear. At\r\nthis time the Court is not satisfied that the relief sought should be\r\ngranted. On the other hand it is realized that a final decision should\r\nnot much longer be delayed. In the determination of this matter the\r\nCourt, while fully recognizing the rights of the defendants, is mindful\r\nof the rights of the People and its own sense of responsibility, and is\r\nanxious to avoid a decision which will serve as a mischievous precedent.\r\n\r\nIt is idle to attempt to ignore the inherent probabilities of the\r\nsituation presented. A material and indispensable witness is absent from\r\nthe State, and the Court is called upon to intervene because the\r\nDistrict Attorney has at practically every turn followed the lead of\r\nthese defendants. Through the influence of unusual agencies the law has\r\nbroken down, so far as these cases are concerned. The crimes charged are\r\nof the most serious nature, because such criminal activity tends to sap\r\nthe very foundations of government. The statute of limitations has run\r\nagainst these charges and if the application is granted, therefore,\r\nthere can be no further prosecution, no matter what developments may\r\nfollow. (Sec. 800 Penal Code.) In the trial of Patrick Calhoun the Court\r\nadmitted evidence of a most extraordinary character on the theory of the\r\nPeople that it tended to show guilty consciousness on the part of the\r\naccused. This evidence was not contraverted. It included the dynamiting\r\nof the home of the witness under circumstances which threatened not only\r\nhis life, but also the lives of several other persons. A certain other\r\nbuilding, the property of the witness, was subsequently blown up by the\r\nuse of dynamite. If the apparent design on the life of the witness had\r\nbeen successful, the Court would be less perplexed in deciding a\r\nquestion of this character. It is possible that these experiences and\r\nnot the suggested arrangement with the witness are responsible for his\r\nabsence. The evidence also included an effort to suppress testimony by\r\nan attempt to induce a witness to leave the jurisdiction of the Court,\r\nand other matters of a serious nature.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, while the Court is clear that it should not base any\r\naction at this time upon the assumption that either side is responsible\r\nfor the absence of the witness, yet reason and the exercise of a sound\r\ndiscretion dictate that the Court should act with prudence. Before the\r\nindictments should be finally disposed of, every reasonable effort\r\nshould be made to get at the truth of the situation. The disposition of\r\ngrave charges other than on their merits is not to be encouraged and\r\nshould not be allowed, except in the face of a strict legal necessity.\r\nLet the cases be continued until 10 a. m., Monday, August 29th, 1910. So\r\nordered.\r\n\r\n\r\n                HOW THE SUPERVISORS WERE BRIBED.\r\n\r\nThomas F. Lonergan, when elected to the Schmitz-Ruef Board of\r\nSupervisors, was a driver of a bakery wagon. He recited at the trial of\r\nThe People vs. Louis Glass, the manner in which he had been bribed by\r\nagents of the Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company. Lonergan's\r\ntestimony was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I reside in Sanchez street, San Francisco. I have lived in San\r\nFrancisco since March, 1879. I have a family composed of a wife and\r\nthree children. I was in the bakery business. I was in that business\r\nquite a number of years. I worked latterly for Mr. Foley. I worked in a\r\nbake shop quite a while and also drove a wagon for him. I do not hold\r\nany official position now. I did hold the position of Supervisor of the\r\nCity and County of San Francisco. I was elected Supervisor in November,\r\n1905, and took office on January 7th or 8th, 1906. I know John Kraus. I\r\nfirst met him some time after my election at my home. I did not invite\r\nhim to come there.\r\n\r\n\"One morning, some time after my election, the doorbell rang, a\r\ngentleman was at the door and wanted to see me. I went downstairs. He\r\nasked me if I was Mr. Lonergan. I said yes. He says, 'The recently\r\nelected Supervisor?' or words to that effect. I said yes. He says, 'I\r\ndon't think you are the man I wanted. I came out here from the East a\r\nfew years back with a Mr. Lonergan, and I thought he was the one that\r\nmight have been elected.' I said, 'No, you are mistaken, it is the other\r\none,' or something like that. He then incidentally told me he was\r\nconnected with the Pacific States Telephone Company, and would be\r\npleased to take me around their works at any time that I would find it\r\nconvenient. I answered him as well as I recall now, that I possibly\r\nwould take it in some time. I subsequently went to the telephone\r\ncompany's office. To the best of my recollection I saw Mr. Kraus in the\r\nmeantime before going there, and made an appointment with him. I don't\r\nwell remember meeting him at the telephone company's office. I think\r\nwhere I met him was on the corner of Mason and Market or Powell and\r\nMarket, one or the other, around there. That was by appointment. Then I\r\nwent with him to the telephone company's plant on Bush street, I think,\r\nout in the Western Addition at that time. He took me through the works,\r\nshowing me the works and the arrangements in connection with it, and how\r\nthey treated their help, and stated to me they were installing another\r\nnew plant, I forget now whether it was one or two or more. After we left\r\nthere I had lunch with Mr. Kraus. I don't well remember where. He spoke\r\nabout an opposition company in that talk. The opposition company was\r\nspoken of, considering the appliances they had, and the amount of work\r\nthey were then doing, and the new switchboards they would put in, that\r\nit didn't appear necessary to have an opposition company here. Mr. Kraus\r\npaid for the lunch, I believe.\r\n\r\n\"I am acquainted with Mr. T. V. Halsey. I first met him, I think, either\r\non Pine or Bush street, to the best of my recollection. I. N. Copus\r\nintroduced me to him. To the best of my recollection it was some time\r\nafter meeting Kraus and before I took office as Supervisor. That meeting\r\nwas by appointment. Mr. Copus made the appointment I believe. To the\r\nbest of my recollection that was my first meeting with Mr. Halsey. I\r\nthink I was introduced to him by Mr. Copus at the time and place of the\r\nmeeting. We adjourned to lunch at a restaurant that we were standing in\r\nfront of. We went upstairs in the restaurant, had some lunch. Nothing\r\nparticular was spoken of there outside of the current topics. The room\r\nwe lunched in was not a public dining room. It was a private room. Copus\r\nwent up to lunch with us. I believe Mr. Halsey paid for the lunch. We\r\nwere there possibly an hour or an hour and a half. We had Sauterne wine\r\nto drink, as well as I remember. The next time I saw Halsey to the best\r\nof my recollection was at his office on Bush street, in the telephone\r\nbuilding there. It was some time between the 12th and 14th and the 20th\r\nof February, 1906, I should judge. I think I went there on that occasion\r\non the invitation of Mr. Kraus, as well as I remember, that Mr. Halsey\r\nwould like to see me. I found Halsey when I got there. I am not\r\nconversant with the building; I suppose the part of the building I met\r\nhim in was his office. I don't remember whether there was any one else\r\nin the room. I had a talk with him in there. No one else was present\r\nwhile I was talking with him that I am aware of. Mr. Halsey, as well as\r\nI remember, spoke to me about the foolishness of having a second\r\ntelephone system in San Francisco. He told me the same as Mr. Kraus had\r\ntold me--all they had accomplished, and that they were going to\r\naccomplish, and that it would cost merchants twofold for the other\r\ntelephone, and they wanted to know if I would not be friendly toward\r\nthem. I told him I was deeply impressed with the workings as I had seen\r\nthem, and that I felt that I could be friendly to them. I cannot\r\nremember the exact words he then said at the time. The substance of it\r\nwas that it would be to my interest to be friendly, or rather, that they\r\nwould make it to my interest to be friendly to them, and I was told--I\r\nthink it was at that meeting--that there would be five thousand dollars\r\nin it for my friendship down, and $2,500 the following year, provided I\r\ndid not accept a commission, or any such thing as that while I remained\r\na member of the Board of Supervisors. To the best of my recollection at\r\nthat time I received from him one thousand dollars in currency. I put it\r\nin my pocket and took it home. The next time I saw Mr. Halsey was some\r\nfew days later. It was the Saturday previous to the passing to print of\r\nthe ordinance relative to the Home Telephone Company. That meeting was\r\nheld in a room in the Mills Building. I cannot well recollect whether I\r\nwas telephoned for or not; I possibly must have been. The meeting was up\r\nin the building some few stories. To the best of my recollection it was\r\non the side of the building that looked out on Bush street, and not very\r\nfar from the corner of Montgomery street. I found Mr. Kraus there when I\r\nwent in. There was no one else in the room where Kraus was. That room\r\nwas furnished with a table and a couple of chairs. Well, he asked me if\r\nhe could depend upon me as to my friendship in regard to the Pacific\r\nStates Telephone Company, and I told him I saw no reason why he could\r\nnot. I don't remember whether anything was said about the Home Telephone\r\nCompany franchise. There may have been. I can't recollect just at this\r\nmoment. He told me that he had a sufficiency of the members of the Board\r\nof Supervisors, to the best of my recollection, who were friendly\r\ntowards the Pacific States, and that they did not particularly need Mr.\r\nCoffey, except that I had spoken well of him, and depending on my\r\nfriendship, he gave me the four thousand dollars in currency. During our\r\nconversation I had mentioned Mr. Coffey as a friend of mine that I\r\nthought was particularly friendly towards them. I don't well remember\r\nwhether he then said he would see Mr. Coffey, or not, or whether he made\r\nanswer. I do remember that he said at the latter meeting that they did\r\nnot particularly need him, that he had a sufficiency of the members. I\r\ntook it home and gave it to my wife.\r\n\r\n\"To the best of my recollection I next saw Mr. Halsey at my home the\r\nlatter end of the following week after I got the money. No one else was\r\npresent when he talked with me. It was in the front room of my house.\"\r\n\r\nSupervisor Michael W. Coffey was a hack driver. At the Glass trial he\r\ntold the manner in which the bribe-givers approached him. He said:\r\n\r\n\"I have lived in San Francisco about forty years. I have been in the\r\ncarriage business driving a hack. I own a hack of my own. My stand was\r\non Fifth street, right opposite the Mint. I was elected a member of the\r\nBoard of Supervisors in November, 1905, and took office early in\r\nJanuary, 1906. I am a married man. My family consists of four girls and\r\none boy. I am acquainted with T. V. Halsey. I first met him some time in\r\nthe month of December at my hackstand. I am acquainted with John Kraus.\r\nI first met him about the same time. At the time that I met Halsey at\r\nthe hackstand, Kraus was with him. I am not sure whether it was the\r\nfirst time, but probably the second time. I think Mr. Kraus came to see\r\nme first, and Mr. Halsey came with him afterwards. Well, he, Kraus, just\r\ncame up merely to introduce himself to me, and asked me how business\r\nwas. There was nothing said at the time that he brought Halsey to me.\r\nThere was nothing said pertaining to telephone matters at that time,\r\nneither; it was simply merely to give me an introduction and ask me up\r\nto have a drink on the corner of Jessie and Fifth streets. Nothing was\r\nsaid about the telephone service at that time. I next met Halsey a few\r\ndays afterwards. Both Halsey and Kraus were there together at that time,\r\nand we spoke--they spoke to me about my telephone service, both home\r\nand in the drugstore in front of which I had my hackstand, and asked\r\nme if the telephone service was satisfactory. I told them it certainly\r\nwas, that I couldn't find any fault with either one. The drugstore\r\n'phone I had nothing at all to do with, any more than I had the\r\nprivilege of placing the number of the telephone upon my business cards\r\nso that my friends could know where to find me in case they wanted to\r\ntelephone me. I paid for no service on that 'phone at all. My hackstand\r\nwas right in front of the drugstore. I should judge Halsey and Kraus\r\ncame around there to see me between three times and a half-a-dozen. I\r\nreceived telephone messages from Mr. Halsey several times. He called me\r\nby 'phone, he telephoned to the house, and to the stand, and wanted me\r\nto come down to see him. I went down to see him one time. He after that\r\ninvited me around to the telephone company's offices, to view the\r\nsystem, but I never accepted his offer, I never went with him. The first\r\noccasion that I went down to the telephone company's office to see him\r\nhe extended me an invitation to come around amongst the different branch\r\noffices there to see the system, how it was working, and show me the\r\nadvantages of a one-system telephone. Kraus was there on one occasion.\r\nSomewhere around in the neighborhood of noon time, Mr. Kraus was there,\r\nand Mr. Halsey asked me if I had lunch. I told him no, not at that time,\r\nso he asked Mr. Kraus to take me out to lunch, excusing himself on the\r\nground of a previous engagement, that he couldn't go to lunch, but he\r\nasked Mr. Kraus to take me out to lunch and Mr. Kraus did so.\r\n\r\n\"I had a talk with Halsey in the Mills Building. I can't exactly tell\r\nthe date, but it was on a Saturday, in and around noon time. I can't\r\nexactly fix the date. It was some time, I think, in the month of\r\nFebruary. We caucused on the Sunday night, and it was Saturday, either\r\nthe week prior to the caucus or the day before the caucus. This caucus\r\nwas the Sunday prior to the passing of the ordinance to print which was\r\non a Monday. I went to the Mills Building by telephone invitation of Mr.\r\nHalsey. When I got down there I took the elevator and went up on, I\r\nthink, the seventh floor at the extreme end of the building, on one of\r\nthe rooms facing on Bush street, and the other on Montgomery street. I\r\nfound Mr. Halsey there and no one else with him. To the best of my\r\nrecollection there was either a box or a chair and a table, and a\r\ntelephone in there, and no other furniture at all in the room. Mr.\r\nHalsey when I went in, said, 'Good day, Mr. Coffey.' Said I, 'How do you\r\ndo, Mr. Halsey?' I says, 'Did you telephone for me?' He says, 'Yes, I\r\nwant you to be friendly with the company,' and stepped into another\r\nroom, the door leading into the Montgomery street entrance, and then\r\ncame out with a parcel, a bundle, and handed it to me, and says, 'I\r\nwould like to have your friendship for the company.' I did not open the\r\npackage at that time. Nothing was said then about the Home Telephone\r\nCompany's application for the franchise. I took this package that he\r\nhanded me home and put it in a box in the room. I did not open it when I\r\ngot home, not at that time. Subsequently I did. When I opened it I found\r\nin it five thousand dollars in United States currency. That was very\r\nshortly after I had been in the Mills Building on that occasion. I think\r\nit was a few days after that. After putting this money in the box I kept\r\nit there.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  GALLAGHER'S ORDER REMOVING LANGDON FROM OFFICE OF DISTRICT ATTORNEY.\r\n\r\n                       (October 25, 1906.)\r\n\r\n     \"To the Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San\r\n     Francisco:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen--Pursuant to the provisions of the Charter of the City and\r\nCounty of San Francisco, and especially in pursuance of Sections 18 and\r\n19 of Article XVI thereof, I, James L. Gallagher, Mayor of the City and\r\nCounty of San Francisco, do hereby suspend William H. Langdon, District\r\nAttorney of the City and County of San Francisco, and an elected officer\r\nthereof, for cause, as hereinafter assigned and specified, and I hereby\r\nnotify you of such suspension and the causes therefor, which are as\r\nhereinafter assigned and specified.\r\n\r\n\"Said cause is contained in the following specifications, which\r\nspecifications I hereby also present to you as the written charges\r\nagainst said William H. Langdon, District Attorney as aforesaid, and I\r\nhereby present said specifications of causes of such suspension as\r\nwritten charges against said William H. Langdon, District Attorney,\r\nsuspended by me as aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\"Specification 1:\r\n                      =\"Neglect of Duty.=\r\n\r\n\"In this, that for a period of about 30 days prior to the presentation\r\nof these charges the said William H. Langdon, District Attorney as\r\naforesaid, has absented himself from the City and County of San\r\nFrancisco, without leave, and has neglected his official duties, being\r\nduring that time engaged in the canvass and campaign for the office of\r\nGovernor of the State of California.\r\n\r\n\"That during said time, owing to the recent disaster, a large number of\r\nacts of violence have occurred at the hands of criminals congregated in\r\nsaid city, resulting in an excessive and unusual number of murders,\r\nmaimings, assassinations, assaults and other crimes of violence, tending\r\nto render the city unsafe and to injure its reputation, yet the said\r\nDistrict Attorney wilfully, without permission from any of the public\r\nauthorities of said city and county, did absent himself a greater\r\nportion of said time from said city and county, and so negligently\r\nconducted and performed the duties of his said office as District\r\nAttorney as to render no active or efficient assistance to said city and\r\ncounty in the proper prosecution, detection or preventing of any of said\r\ncrimes, and during the main portion of said period did leave his said\r\noffice without the aid of his superintendence, direction or service,\r\nthereby being guilty of inefficiency in such public office and being\r\nnegligent and inattentive in the performance of his public duties at a\r\ntime when the unusual activity of those engaged in crimes of violence\r\ndemanded and required his personal presence and greatest personal\r\nactivity to aid in preventing or attempting to prevent, detecting or\r\nattempting to detect or punish the said crimes or the persons guilty\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n\"Specification 2:\r\n\r\n                =\"Neglect and Dereliction of Duty.=\r\n\r\n\"In this, that during the period of about 30 days last past, the\r\nnewspapers of the City and County of San Francisco have published and\r\nproclaimed that the said William H. Langdon, as District Attorney, and\r\nothers co-operating with him, were, and for months past had been, in the\r\npossession of evidence sufficient to convict certain officials of the\r\ncity and county of serious crimes. These charges have been repeated\r\ndaily and within the knowledge and cognizance of said District Attorney,\r\nand yet notwithstanding said knowledge and said purposes, the said\r\nDistrict Attorney has failed to cause the arrest of any of said\r\nofficials, and if the charges so publicly made are and were not true,\r\nthe said District Attorney had knowledge of said falsity and untruth,\r\nand yet notwithstanding said knowledge has failed to cause the arrest of\r\nthe publishers or editors of the newspapers for publishing said\r\nstatements for criminal libel.\r\n\r\n\"Specification 3:\r\n\r\n                  =\"Neglect and Violation of Duty.=\r\n\r\n\"That under the provisions of the Charter of the City and County of San\r\nFrancisco, it is part of the duty of the District Attorney, when\r\nrequired, to advise the Board of Police Commissioners, the Chief of\r\nPolice, the Board of Health, or the Coroner as to the matters relating\r\nto the duties of their respective offices, yet notwithstanding said\r\nofficial duty, the said William H. Langdon, as such District Attorney,\r\nhas entered into a combination and conspiracy for political purposes and\r\neffect to bring unmerited discredit upon said officials or some of them,\r\nand has failed to advise them relative to their duties, and has assumed\r\na position and attitude inconsistent with his duty to the Police\r\nCommissioners and the Chief of Police, thereby tending to impair and\r\ndemoralize the Police Department of said city at a serious and critical\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"Specification 4:\r\n\r\n                   \"Neglect and Violation of Duty.\r\n\r\n\"That the said William H. Langdon, being the District Attorney of said\r\nCity and County of San Francisco, as aforesaid, during period above\r\nmentioned, in addition to neglecting his public duties, as above set\r\nforth, instead of aiding the authorities of said city and county, did on\r\nthe contrary engage in and assist in a combination in the interest of\r\ncertain insurance corporations and other persons to injure and defame\r\nthe character of the Chief Executive of this city, Mayor Eugene E.\r\nSchmitz, in substance as follows:\r\n\r\n\"A large number of German insurance companies, having lost many millions\r\nof dollars by the conflagration of April 18, 1906, having denied their\r\nliability, Eugene E. Schmitz, Mayor of the City and County of San\r\nFrancisco, deemed it advisable in the interest of the upbuilding and\r\nrehabilitating of the city, to visit the German Empire in his official\r\ncapacity for the purpose of stating the true facts concerning said\r\nconflagration to the home officials of said companies and to use his\r\npersonal influence wherever the same would be available in the German\r\nEmpire, with a view to cause the said insurance companies to pay the\r\nsaid losses; and deeming said matter one of great public interest, the\r\nsaid Mayor did obtain from the Board of Supervisors a leave of absence\r\nfrom the City and County of San Francisco for a period of 60 days from\r\nOctober 1, 1906; and after he left on said mission, a combination, plot\r\nand plan was formed for the purpose of defaming and injuring and\r\nweakening the standing and reputation of said Eugene E. Schmitz, in\r\norder that his said attempts might be discredited and to destroy\r\nwhatever influence the Chief Executive of this city might have in\r\ndealing with the said insurance companies at their home offices and in\r\nobtaining influence abroad to compel said companies to properly\r\nrecognize their obligations; and that as a part of said scheme, it was\r\ndetermined to print and publish in the newspapers of San Francisco\r\ncharges against the said Mayor which were false, malicious and\r\nslanderous and known so to be by the parties engaged in said scheme, and\r\namong other things said persons so engaged did cause it to be published\r\nthat the Chief Executive of this city was a fugitive from justice and\r\nhad absconded from the City and County of San Francisco; and that the\r\nsaid William H. Langdon, as District Attorney of the City and County of\r\nSan Francisco, and acting in his capacity as such, did aid, assist and\r\nabet and further the said scheme as aforesaid, and has become and is an\r\nactive party thereto to the end that said Mayor should be induced to\r\nreturn to San Francisco to defend himself against such charges before he\r\ncould have time to accomplish the said purpose for which he went to said\r\nGerman Empire.\r\n\r\n\"Specification 5:\r\n\r\n    =\"Violation of Duty and Use of Office for Ulterior Purposes.=\r\n\r\n\"That during the fall of 1905, one Francis J. Heney, in a public speech\r\nin said city and county, aspersed the character and good name of a\r\nprominent citizen of this community, and stated that he knew him to be\r\ncorrupt, and said citizen having instantly demanded that said Heney be\r\ncompelled to make proof of said assertions and said Heney having been\r\ncompelled to appear before the Grand Jury of said City and County of San\r\nFrancisco with reference thereto, there admitted that he had made such\r\nstatements without any personal knowledge regarding the same, which\r\nfacts were widely published at the time, and brought said Heney into\r\nobloquy and contempt, from which time said Heney had been possessed of a\r\npurpose to effect a personal revenge both against the object of his\r\nfalse charges and against Eugene E. Schmitz, Mayor of San Francisco, and\r\nall of these facts were and are well known to said William H. Langdon,\r\nas District Attorney as aforesaid; yet notwithstanding said knowledge\r\nand within the month of October, 1906, the said William H. Langdon, in\r\norder to enable said Heney to use public office, position and power to\r\ngratify his spirit of revenge and malice, did appoint said Heney\r\nAssistant District Attorney of said city and county, and did turn over\r\nto him the powers of office of said District Attorney in order that he\r\nmight gratify his private revenge and malice.\r\n\r\n\"Specification 6:\r\n\r\n\"That prior to such appointment as such Assistant District Attorney,\r\nsaid Francis J. Heney had publicly assailed the Judges of the Superior\r\nCourt of the city and county as corrupt and crooked, and had denounced\r\nall or nearly all of them as dishonest and corrupt, and yet has failed\r\nat any time to make proof of such charges, which facts were all well\r\nknown to said William H. Langdon, District Attorney as aforesaid, from\r\nthe time of the utterance, which was long anterior to the time of said\r\nHeney's appointment by said Langdon, and said Langdon also knew that\r\nsaid Heney frequently, while intoxicated, made grave and serious charges\r\ninvolving the personal character of citizens of this city, yet\r\nnotwithstanding such knowledge said William H. Langdon did appoint said\r\nHeney to such office, knowing that the said Heney in such office would\r\nbe required to appear before the Judges whose character he had thus\r\naspersed, and to practice in their courts, did appoint said Heney to\r\nsaid office, which appointment is not conducive to the proper\r\nco-operation which should exist between the Judges of the Superior Court\r\nand the office of District Attorney.\r\n\r\n\"Specification 7:\r\n\r\n\"That said Francis J. Heney at and prior to the time of his appointment\r\nas Assistant District Attorney was the representative of the corporation\r\ncontrolling the street car system of said city and county in a certain\r\ndispute between said corporation and its employes, That the appointment\r\nof said Heney to said office will, in regard to the enforcement of law\r\nagainst said corporation, be prejudicial and detrimental to the\r\ninterests of said city and county.\r\n\r\n\"Specification 8:\r\n\r\n\"That prior to the turning over of said District Attorney's office and\r\nits powers to said Francis J. Heney, as hereinabove specified, the City\r\nand County of San Francisco had intended to procure its own water supply\r\nand thereby to prevent the exorbitant charges for water now exacted by\r\nthe private corporation controlling the city's water supply, and that it\r\nwas about to take proceedings to provide a safe and secure supply of\r\nwater for said City and County of San Francisco for domestic use,\r\nextinction of conflagrations, etc., and that such purpose was greatly\r\nto the interest of said City and County of San Francisco, That said\r\ncorporation now supplying water to said city and county is bitterly\r\nopposed to the acquiring of a water supply to the City and County of San\r\nFrancisco on account of its present monopoly.\r\n\r\n\"Said Francis J. Heney has been and is attorney employed by said Water\r\nCompany, and his attorneyship for such company is inconsistent with the\r\nholding of a place as Assistant District Attorney, and against the best\r\ninterests of the people of San Francisco.\r\n\r\n\"Specification 9:\r\n\r\n\"That in the interest of the corporations and persons before mentioned,\r\nor some or all of them, together with persons unknown, large sums of\r\nmoney have been and are being raised for the purpose of slandering,\r\ndefaming and injuring the reputation of said Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz,\r\nand of suborning perjury against him, thereby injuring the interests of\r\nsaid city and county and its residents and inhabitants; and said William\r\nH. Langdon as such District Attorney, knowing said facts, by the\r\nappointment of said Heney, is knowingly aiding and abetting the said\r\nplot and scheme.\r\n\r\n\"Specification 10:\r\n\r\n            =\"Violation of Duty and Ulterior Use of Office.=\r\n\r\n\"That since the appointment of said F. J. Heney as an Assistant District\r\nAttorney of the City and County of San Francisco by said William H.\r\nLangdon, the said Langdon and the said Heney have caused to be published\r\nor have been parties to the publication of open and covert threats\r\nagainst the Superior Judges of the City and County of San Francisco for\r\nthe purpose of influencing the judicial action of said Judges.\r\n\r\n\"Specification 11:\r\n\r\n\"That the appointment of said Heney as such Assistant District Attorney\r\nwas made by said Langdon in furtherance of the combination aforesaid,\r\nand at the dictation of certain newspaper influences and individuals,\r\nwho have contributed many thousands of dollars to further the political\r\nambitions and aspirations of said William H. Langdon and other persons,\r\nand to secure through the appointment of said Heney the consummation of\r\na political plan and the wreaking of their private revenges against\r\nEugene E. Schmitz, Mayor of San Francisco, and the Board of Supervisors\r\nand the Police Department of the City and County of San Francisco and\r\ntheir political supporters, and to generally disrupt the business and\r\nproper government of this city, and also for the purpose of attempting\r\nto influence the ensuing election. And said combination is also in\r\npursuance of a well-defined and organized plan for the purpose of\r\ncontrolling and subjugating the labor market and the wage-earners.\r\n\r\n\"And the said William H. Langdon turned over said office of District\r\nAttorney as aforesaid to said Francis J. Heney with the intent and\r\npurpose and with the understanding that said Francis J. Heney would and\r\nshould abuse such position, and use his said position as a deputy in a\r\nsubstantial control of said office of District Attorney to gratify his\r\nown private and personal revenge, and also with the intent that said\r\nFrancis J. Heney, through said office, should produce before the Grand\r\nJury of said city and county illegal and hearsay evidence which by law\r\nsaid Grand Jury is forbidden to act upon, and procure such Grand Jury to\r\nreturn indictments against innocent citizens of said city and county\r\nupon such illegal and hearsay evidence for the purpose of gratifying the\r\nprivate revenge of said Francis J. Heney and the political ambitions of\r\nsaid William H. Langdon. And said William H. Langdon also further turned\r\nover said office and power to said Francis J. Heney with the intent and\r\npurpose that said Francis J. Heney in such position should advise such\r\nGrand Jury that matters and acts not constituting an offense at law were\r\nindictable offenses, and thus and thereby falsely and unlawfully procure\r\nindictments against innocent citizens of said city and county.\r\n\r\n\"Specification 12:\r\n\r\n\"That in addition to the purposes hereinabove specified as a foundation\r\nand reason for the acts set forth, that all the acts hereinabove charged\r\nand set forth as having been done, aided, abetted, procured or assisted\r\nby said William H. Langdon as said District Attorney, were so done and\r\nperformed by said William H. Langdon as such District Attorney to\r\npromote his own political ambitions and upon and at the eve of an\r\nelection about to occur in the State of California, at which said\r\nWilliam H. Langdon is a candidate for Governor, all with intent to\r\ndeceive and mislead electors and voters and to procure an increased vote\r\nfor himself as such candidate for Governor.\r\n\r\n\"Inefficiency in the office of District Attorney, and neglect on the\r\npart of the District Attorney and his office to perform the duties of\r\nhis office.\r\n\r\n\"Dated, San Francisco, October 25, 1906.\r\n\r\n                                        \"JAMES L.

Schmitz, who, having been elected Mayor\r\nof the City and County of San Francisco in November, 1905, was on the\r\n13th day of June, 1907, convicted of a felony; to wit, of the crime of\r\nextortion, by a jury in Department No. 6 of the Superior Court of the\r\nCity and County of San Francisco, State of California. Thereafter, upon\r\nthe 8th day of July, 1907, judgment upon the conviction was duly\r\npronounced and entered, by which a sentence was imposed of five years'\r\nimprisonment in the State Prison at San Quentin.\r\n\r\n\"The Political Code of this State, and the charter of the City and\r\nCounty of San Francisco, both provide that the office becomes vacant\r\nwhen the incumbent is convicted of a felony, and in several decisions\r\nour Supreme Court has held that the words 'convicted of a felony,'\r\nsignify the verdict of a jury. That court has also held that this\r\nprovision of the code and charter is self-acting, and that the vacancy\r\nis created 'eo instanti,' upon the happening of the event, and that all\r\nthat is necessary is for the appointing power to fill the vacancy thus\r\ncreated. By virtue of the conviction of Eugene E. Schmitz, the office of\r\nMayor of the City and County of San Francisco became vacant. Upon the\r\n9th day of July, 1907, the Board of Supervisors, pursuant to the\r\ncharter, elected as Mayor to fill the vacancy thus created Dr. Charles\r\nBoxton. This action was taken to avoid legal complications in the\r\ninterim, before a permanent selection of Mayor could be made, and it is\r\nthoroughly well understood that the selection of Dr. Charles Boxton is\r\nmerely temporary.\r\n\r\n\"The conditions surrounding the present Board of Supervisors have been\r\nso completely explained, through the public press, that it is\r\nunnecessary to go into further detail in that regard than to say that\r\nDr. Boxton has offered to resign his office as Mayor, as soon as a\r\nsuitable successor has been found. In the present unprecedented\r\ncondition of the municipal government, circumstances have made it the\r\nduty of the District Attorney, in the interest of the public welfare, to\r\ntake the initiative, in the endeavor to find such a successor.\r\n\r\n\"It is the desire of the District Attorney as speedily as possible to\r\nconfine the operations of his office entirely to those duties ordinarily\r\nincumbent upon it. The next election for city officers takes place in\r\nNovember of this year, but the situation of the city government, and the\r\nmaterial conditions obtaining in the city with regard to necessary\r\npublic improvements, render it absolutely indispensable that we proceed\r\nwith the utmost energy to obtain for the office of Mayor a man of\r\nunblemished integrity and great executive ability.\r\n\r\n\"The District Attorney and his associates, realizing that the selection\r\nof a Mayor to fill the unexpired term in question should be made by as\r\nrepresentative a body of the people as possible, have deemed it wise to\r\ncall together a convention that will be, as nearly as circumstances and\r\nthe time at our disposal permit, fairly representative of the community\r\nat large. For that purpose they have decided to call together a\r\nconvention composed of thirty delegates, fifteen of whom shall represent\r\nlabor, and the remaining fifteen shall represent employers generally.\r\n\r\n\"It is, of course, impossible on account of the limited time at our\r\ndisposal to accord representation to all the organized bodies in the\r\ncity entitled to the same. All that we can reasonably be expected to do\r\nis to make a sincere and earnest effort to have the convention composed\r\nof delegates from such well-known organized bodies, large and varied in\r\nmembership, that the people generally will be satisfied that the plan of\r\nselection is fair, reasonable and democratic.\r\n\r\n\"The prosecution in the graft cases feels that it is highly desirable to\r\nkeep politics out of the organization of the city government as much as\r\npossible until the people, in the manner ordained by law, have an\r\nopportunity at the ballot-box again to express their will directly.\r\n\r\n\"We address this communication and invitation to the following bodies,\r\nto wit: The San Francisco Labor Council, the Merchants' Association, the\r\nBuilding Trades Council, the Chamber of Commerce, the Board of Trade,\r\nthe Real Estate Board and the Merchants' Exchange. We respectfully\r\nrequest the foregoing associations to send delegates to the proposed\r\nconvention on the following basis of apportionment, that is to say, that\r\nthe two bodies representing labor shall select fifteen delegates, eight\r\nof whom shall be selected by the San Francisco Labor Council and seven\r\nby the Building Trades Council, and the remaining fifteen members of the\r\nconvention shall be selected, three each, by the remaining five bodies\r\nabove mentioned.\r\n\r\n\"It will be appreciated that it is necessary to impose a time limit\r\nwithin which the selection of delegates shall be made, and the\r\nsubsequent nomination of a Mayor by the convention shall be\r\naccomplished. In that view we ask that a response to this invitation,\r\ncontaining the names of the delegates selected, be delivered to the\r\nDistrict Attorney's office, 2181 Fillmore street, on or before Saturday,\r\nJuly 13, 1907, and that the Mayor be nominated within five days\r\nthereafter. The success of this plan, in our judgment, depends\r\nabsolutely upon the harmonious co-operation of all sections of our\r\npeople, who, we believe, are fairly represented by one or more of the\r\nforegoing associations. Consequently we deem it essential to prescribe\r\nas a condition for the assembling of the proposed convention that this\r\ninvitation shall be accepted by all of these bodies.\r\n\r\n\"This plan for the selection of a Mayor is the result of most patient,\r\nthorough and anxious deliberation on the part of those associated in the\r\ngraft prosecution, and its single purpose is to satisfy, so far as in\r\nour power, the desire of all good citizens to sink factional and\r\npolitical differences and choose for Mayor a man who will be generally\r\nrecognized and accepted as representative of the whole people, who will\r\nbring to all industrial disputes a spirit of conciliation and harmony,\r\nand who will be possessed of the capacity, energy and honesty needed in\r\nthe great work of rehabilitating our city and restoring it to normal\r\nconditions. We desire that perfect freedom and independence of action\r\nshall govern the convention from its inception to its close, and\r\naccordingly the District Attorney and his associates will wholly refrain\r\nfrom any participation after the convention has assembled. I have the\r\nhonor to be,\r\n\r\n                                    \"Yours very truly,\r\n                              \"W. H.

There is no form\r\nof slander and wicked falsehood which will not as a matter of course be\r\nemployed against all men engaged in such a struggle, and this not only\r\non the part of men and papers representing the lowest type of demagogy,\r\nbut, I am sorry to say, also on the part of men and papers representing\r\nthe interests that call themselves pre-eminently conservative,\r\npre-eminently cultured.\r\n\r\n\"In such a struggle it is too often true that the feeling against those\r\nengaged in it becomes peculiarly bitter, not merely in the business\r\nhouses of the great financiers who directly profit by the wrongdoing,\r\nbut also in the clubs, in certain newspaper offices where business\r\ninterests exercise an unhealthy control and, I regret to add, in other\r\nnewspaper offices which like to be considered as to a marked degree the\r\nrepresentatives of the cultivation and high social standing of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I do hope that you and your colleagues will treat all this\r\nbitterness with entire disregard. It is of small consequence to you, or\r\nto any of us who are engaged in this work, whether men think well or ill\r\nof us personally; but it is of very great consequence that we should do\r\nthe work without flinching, on the one hand, and on the other hand,\r\nwithout losing our good-humored common sense, without becoming angered\r\nand irritated to a degree that will in any way cause us to lose our\r\nheads.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, I hope that you and Heney and your associates will keep\r\nreasonably good-natured; but that above all things you will not lose\r\nheart. You must battle on valiantly, no matter what the biggest business\r\nmen may say, no matter what the mob may say, no matter what may be said\r\nby that element which may be regarded as socially the highest element.\r\nYou must steadfastly oppose those foolish or wicked men who would\r\nsubstitute class consciousness and loyalty to class interest, for\r\nloyalty to American citizenship as a whole, for loyalty to the immutable\r\nlaws of righteousness, of just and fair dealing as between man and man.\r\n\r\n\"It is just as bad to be ruled by a plutocracy as by a mob. It is\r\nprofoundly un-American and, in a social sense, profoundly immoral, to\r\nstand for or against a given man, not because he is or is not a brave,\r\nupright and able man, but because he does or does not belong to a labor\r\nunion or does or does not represent the big business interests. In their\r\nessence, down at the foundation of things, the ties that are\r\nall-important are those that knit honest men, brave men, square-dealing\r\nmen, together, and it is a mighty poor substitute if we replace these\r\nties by those that bind men together, whether they are good or bad,\r\nsimply because they follow a particular business, have a given social\r\nstanding or belong to a particular organization. It is an evil and a\r\ndreadful thing for laboring men to endeavor to secure the political\r\ndominance of labor unions by conniving at crookedness or violence, by\r\nbeing 'loyal' to crooked labor leaders, for to be 'loyal' to the fancied\r\ninterests of the unions when they are against the laws of morality and\r\nthe interests of the whole people means ultimately the destruction of\r\nthe unions themselves, as an incident to the destruction of all good\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\n\"But it is, if anything, an even more evil and dreadful thing to have\r\nthe merchants, the business men, the captains of industry accessories to\r\ncrime and shielders and supporters of criminals; it is an even more\r\ndreadful thing to see the power of men high in State politics, high in\r\nfinance, high in the social life of the rich and fashionable, united to\r\nstifle the prosecution of offenders against civic integrity if these\r\noffenders happen to be their friends and associates; and most evil of\r\nall is it when we see crooks of a labor party in offensive and defensive\r\nalliance with the crooks of a corporation party. Labor unions and\r\ncorporations alike should be heartily supported when they do good work,\r\nand fearlessly opposed when they stand for what is evil. The best kind\r\nof wage worker, the best kind of laboring man, must stand shoulder to\r\nshoulder with the best kind of professional man, with the best kind of\r\nbusiness man, in putting a stop to the undermining of civic decency, and\r\nthis without any regard to whether it is a labor union or a corporation\r\nwhich is undermining it, without any regard to whether the offender is a\r\nrich man or a poor man.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, if there can be any degrees in the contemptuous abhorrence with\r\nwhich right thinking citizens should regard corruption, it must be felt\r\nin its most extreme form for the so-called 'best citizens,' the men high\r\nin business and social life, who by backing up or by preventing the\r\npunishment of wealthy criminals set the seal of their approval on crime\r\nand give honor to rich felons. The most powerful ally of lawlessness and\r\nmob violence is the man, whoever he may be, politician or business man,\r\njudge or lawyer, capitalist or editor, who in any way or shape works so\r\nas to shield wealthy and powerful wrongdoers from the consequences of\r\ntheir misconduct.\r\n\r\n\"You have heart-breaking difficulties with which to contend. You have to\r\nfight not only the banded powers of evil, but, alas, that it should be\r\nsaid, the supineness and indifference of many good men upon whose\r\nzealous support you had a right to feel that you could rely. Do not be\r\ndiscouraged; do not flinch. You are in a fight for plain decency, for\r\nthe plain democracy of the plain people, who believe in honesty and in\r\nfair dealing as between man and man. Do not become disheartened. Keep up\r\nthe fight.\r\n\r\n                                       \"Very sincerely yours,\r\n                                                 \"THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n  \"Rudolph Spreckels, Esq.,\r\n    \"San Francisco, Cal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n      GOVERNOR JOHNSON'S STATEMENT REGARDING RUEF'S IMPRISONMENT.\r\n\r\n                =(See Chapter XXIX, page 453.)=\r\n\r\nEver since Abraham Ruef was taken to San Quentin an organized and\r\nsystematic agitation has been carried on to effect his release, and all\r\nthat power, influence and money and favorable publicity could do to\r\nmanufacture public sentiment for him has been done. His case has ever\r\nbeen before the people, and never since his confinement at San Quentin\r\nhas he been permitted to be in the category of the ordinary prisoner.\r\n\r\nPurposely have I heretofore refrained from any public utterance upon the\r\nsubject, and this for reasons that may be obvious. Ruef's partisans now\r\ncharge his failure to obtain his release to me.\r\n\r\nIn so far as I have expressed my views to certain members of the Prison\r\nDirectors, and their views accord with mine, I accept the\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that Ruef should be paroled at this time. I insist that\r\nhe shall be treated just like any ordinary prisoner, neither more\r\nharshly nor more leniently.\r\n\r\nAs vigorously as I am able, I demand that there shall be no special\r\nprivilege in the prisons of the State of California, and that when\r\nspecial privilege has been banished from every department of government,\r\nit shall not be permitted, no matter what the power or threats, to creep\r\ninto our penitentiary.\r\n\r\nThe grossest injustice that could be committed against the other 3,300\r\nmen confined in our State prisons would be to single out the one rich,\r\npowerful and conspicuous offender and, because of his riches and his\r\ninfluence, grant him what is denied to the humble and friendless\r\nprisoner. If prisons are to be maintained, and the system in vogue\r\ncontinued, all prisoners most be treated exactly alike.\r\n\r\nSince the parole law went into effect, the Prison Directors have\r\ncontinuously acted under a rule which required, save in exceptional\r\ncases, the service of half of the net sentence before an application can\r\nbe heard. In the Roberts case, recently decided, the Supreme Court held\r\nthis rule to be illegal, but also held that paroles rested in the\r\nabsolute discretion of the Prison Directors, and that in determining\r\nwhether or not parole shall be granted, it was the right and duty of the\r\nBoard to take into account the length of sentence, the time served, etc.\r\n\r\nAs I understand the attitude of the Directors, they insist that in the\r\nmatter of granting paroles, although applications may be made after one\r\nyear, it is neither unjust nor unfair nor illegal that prisoners be\r\nrequired, save in exceptional cases, to serve half the net sentence.\r\n\r\nThis rule is applicable to 3,300 prisoners, most of them unknown and\r\nunheard of. It is demanded that another rule be made for Ruef.\r\n\r\nRuef's sentence was fourteen years. His net sentence will be eight years\r\nand ten months. Half of the net sentence will be four years and five\r\nmonths. He was received in San Quentin about March, 1911. If required to\r\nserve half his net sentence, presumably he will be paroled about August,\r\n1915. Purposely, apparently, misapprehension has been created about the\r\nrecent parole of Dalton. Dalton desired to be liberated before half his\r\nnet sentence had been served, and was not. He was granted a parole at\r\nthe last meeting of the Prison Directors, which takes effect some months\r\nafter the completion of half of his net sentence.\r\n\r\n              The Recent Action of the Prison Board.\r\n\r\nIn behalf of the parole of Ruef it is insisted that any man is entitled\r\nas a matter of right to a parole after one year's imprisonment. I will\r\nnot subscribe to this doctrine. It has been asserted that the Supreme\r\nCourt has so decided. This is not true. The Supreme Court simply\r\ndetermined that after one year the prisoner had the right to make his\r\napplication, but that his parole rested absolutely thereafter in the\r\ndiscretion of the Prison Board.\r\n\r\nAt the last meeting of the Prison Directors 78 men applied for parole,\r\nRuef among them. None of these had served half his net time and this\r\nfact was known to all the members of the Prison Board. To four members\r\nof the Prison Board before that time every application had been\r\npresented with the history of the case, and with all the facts that had\r\nbeen filed concerning it. Every man, prison director or other, knows the\r\nfacts of the Ruef case. The 78 were all denied parole. When the Ruef\r\npeople assert he had no hearing, they mean he had no such hearing as\r\nRuef desired. When they shout that his case was not considered, they\r\nmean not considered as Ruef demanded. If the hearing had been as Ruef\r\nand his partisans had staged it; if Ruef had delivered an oration, taken\r\ndown by the shorthand reporter, brought for the purpose; if Ruef had\r\ndominated the entire situation, and the Directors had yielded to his\r\npower and his influence; if Ruef had been paroled, what a virtuous and\r\nglorious Prison Board it would have been! But the hearing being\r\notherwise than had been staged, the determination being other than what\r\nthe power of Ruef demanded, the Prison Board is abused and denounced;\r\nnot denounced or abused because 77 other men were not paroled (they are\r\nunknown, poor, helpless, without friends), but abused and denounced\r\nbecause one man, Ruef, was not paroled; because one man, Ruef, was\r\ntreated exactly as all others were treated.\r\n\r\n             The Charge of Bitterness and Vengeance.\r\n\r\nI resent any imputation of bitterness or revenge on my part toward Ruef.\r\nI have neither. More than two years ago I expressed what I write\r\nto-day--that for the sake of society and the unfortunates confined in\r\nprison, Ruef must be treated like all others similarly situated. To\r\nyield because of fear to the persuasion, cajolery or the threats of a\r\npowerful prisoner, is to cause the iron to enter the soul of every\r\nobscure and friendless prisoner, and to make every other one of the\r\n3,300 men in our jails know that even in prisons class distinctions\r\nprevail, and to add to the bitterness and the hopelessness of men\r\nconfined.\r\n\r\nThe bitterness and revenge are on the other side of this controversy. It\r\nhas become necessary to make this statement because of the unmerited\r\nabuse of the Prison Board, and because some individuals, while begging\r\nmercy for Ruef, have without mercy sought Ruef's release by threats of\r\nannihilation and destruction of all opposed.\r\n\r\n                  The Plea That the Past Be Forgotten.\r\n\r\nOften we hear that Ruef is the only one who has been punished of those\r\nguilty of the particular crimes of which he was a part, and that for\r\nthis reason should be liberated.\r\n\r\nIf three men committed a murder, two escape and are never found, and the\r\nthird is convicted, ought he to be released because he is the only one\r\npunished?\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary, however, to discuss this phase of the case. After\r\nconviction and imprisonment, if clemency be asked, ordinarily the only\r\nquestion that can be considered is whether the prisoner is guilty or\r\ninnocent. Does any person claim Ruef to be innocent? If guilty, then to\r\nhim must apply the usual prison discipline and rules.\r\n\r\nThere is to-day in the same prison with Ruef a poor, uneducated,\r\nfriendless Greek, the product of the graft prosecution just as Ruef is.\r\nClaudianes is serving a life sentence for dynamiting Gallagher's\r\nresidence and almost murdering seven people. Claudianes was paid to do\r\nthe dynamiting that Gallagher might be put out of the way. He was the\r\nignorant, sodden instrument of men who would not stop even at murder;\r\nbut he was only the miserable tool after all. No appeal has been made to\r\nme for Claudianes. No petitions have been presented in his behalf, no\r\norganized effort for his release, no threats of political annihilation\r\nunless clemency be extended to him. Why? Is it because Claudianes is\r\nunknown, ignorant, friendless, moneyless?\r\n\r\n                The Unjust Charge of Racial Prejudice.\r\n\r\nEvery cheap politician has been quick to seize upon the Ruef case and\r\nendeavor to make political capital for himself or create hostility to me\r\nout of it. Among the baseless and outrageous things that have been\r\npublished is that Ruef is not granted special privileges and immunities\r\nbecause of racial prejudice. When Ruef was denied parole, denied with\r\nhim were men of many races. No one has claimed that these were denied\r\nparole because of race prejudice.\r\n\r\nIn San Quentin to-day are thirty-one Jews. Thirteen of these, for one\r\nreason or another, have at times lost their privileges. Is it possible\r\nthat Ruef is the only man to be considered? No complaint is made for the\r\nthirty-one, or for the thirteen. Since February 1, 1912, twenty-seven\r\nJews have been paroled from San Quentin. Six of these have been returned\r\nfor violations of parole. In relation to the twenty-seven or the six\r\nthere has been neither outcry nor protest nor publicity nor effort of\r\nany sort. Why the astounding, organized effort and publicity campaign\r\nfor Ruef alone?\r\n\r\nThe appointments that have been made by this administration include\r\nRabbi Meyer, H. Weinstock, Paul Sinsheimer, Simon Lubin, Miss Steinhart,\r\nJulius Jacobs, E. Franklin, Louis Frankenheimer, A. Sapiro, Jacob\r\nAlexander, A. Bonnheim, Miss Peixotto, Judge Cerf and many others. No\r\nlist of more able and patriotic men and women in the service of any\r\nState could be furnished than this.\r\n\r\nIs Ruef the sole test of every question?\r\n\r\nTo two young men of Jewish faith lately have been granted pardons. No\r\ntremendous petitions loaded down with the names of politicians, no\r\nextraordinary publicity was presented in their behalf.\r\n\r\nIs there no man in the list of appointees to whom in pride we may all\r\nyield our praise? Is there no man among the 3,300 prisoners in San\r\nQuentin and Folsom who justly can arouse efforts in his behalf? Or is\r\nthe sole test of official action by the Prison Directors of California\r\nor the Chief Executive of the State to be the disregard of every other\r\nman's rights and the granting to Ruef alone of a privilege that none\r\nother enjoys?\r\n\r\n                    California Prisons To-day.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion that has ensued from the Ruef case and because of the\r\nRuef case, the prisons have been said to be the one part of the present\r\nadministration that is not progressive, and that they are yet a relic of\r\nthe Herrin machine. Nothing could be further from the fact. I challenge\r\ncontradiction of the following statements:\r\n\r\nCalifornia is in the forefront of all the States in the management of\r\nher prisons. In matters of food, shelter, clothing, employment,\r\nrecreation, medical attention, opportunities for education, general\r\nfreedom consistent with discipline, encouragement of decent tendencies,\r\nand =in the number of paroles= (although these have been granted under the\r\nhalf term rule), no State has gone further.\r\n\r\nWithin the past three years the strait-jacket, the water-cure and the\r\nhooks, once so freely used, have not been tolerated. Every form of\r\ncorporal punishment has been abolished. When prisoners are received the\r\neffort is made to get the history of the crime and possible cause of it,\r\nand then to apply corrective measures intelligently. As soon as\r\nreceived, every newcomer is given a thorough physical examination and\r\nhis teeth are looked after by a dentist. It not infrequently happens\r\nthat the first place a man is quartered in is the hospital. Special\r\nattention is given to tuberculars, alcoholics and dope fiends.\r\nWassermann tests are made for the slightest indication of blood taint,\r\nand the best treatment afforded. After the physician and dentist\r\nconclude their examinations, the newcomer is turned over to the Director\r\nof Education, who endeavors to take the man's mental measurement and get\r\nat his moral status. There are now 200 pupils in the day school at San\r\nQuentin, and three rooms of thirty each in the night school. The\r\neducational facilities are being constantly increased. Two hundred and\r\ntwenty-six are enrolled in the academic courses with the University of\r\nCalifornia and by correspondence are receiving their training from our\r\ngreat institutions of learning. The State Use system, which was enacted\r\nin 1911, furnishes work in industries for the State. In the matter of\r\nfood the State purchases the best and the rations issued are abundant.\r\nSanitary conditions are a model in the newly constructed portions of the\r\nprison and the best possible in the old construction.\r\n\r\nIn the last three years 1372 paroles have been granted by this harsh,\r\ncruel and outrageous Prison Board, as against 1132 granted in all the\r\nyears from 1893 to 1910 inclusive. The paroles have been granted,\r\nhowever, justly. Because one was not granted unjustly and unfairly, the\r\nrecord of the Prison Board counts for naught.\r\n\r\nI have purposely refrained from discussing the character of Ruef's\r\ncrimes or any matters extraneous to the one issue presented. I have\r\ntried to make clear that I believe Ruef should be treated just as the\r\nleast known prisoner is treated. That his advocates wish him to be\r\ntreated otherwise because he is Ruef will be clear to any who will\r\nreflect that had Ruef been paroled and the other 77 denied parole there\r\nwould have been no agitation; if Ruef were granted what others were\r\ndenied, there would be no fulminations against the Prison Board and\r\npetty politicians would not have seized upon recent events to bow and\r\nscrape and bend and crawl to the organized power of Ruef.\r\n\r\n\r\n      SCHMITZ'S ATTEMPT TO CONTROL SAN FRANCISCO RELIEF FUNDS.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of June, 1906, it was agreed that a committee\r\nconsisting of Benjamin Ide Wheeler, Judge W. W. Morrow and James D.\r\nPhelan should go to Washington, in order to interest Congress in some\r\nproject for financing the rebuilding of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nBefore their departure, Mayor Schmitz invited them and other members of\r\nthe Committee of Fifty to his residence, where a luncheon was served.\r\nDuring the luncheon he stated that the Board of Supervisors were about\r\nto resume their public functions for which they were elected by the\r\npeople, and the private persons who were administering the affairs of\r\nthe city doubtless would employ their abilities for the rehabilitation\r\nof their own business, and he suggested that the relief fund be turned\r\nover to the Board of Supervisors for distribution. Judge Morrow, Mr.\r\nPhelan and others protested that it was not the function of the\r\nSupervisors to distribute relief, and that there was a trust\r\nrelationship existing between the donors and the finance committee of\r\nthe Relief and Red Cross Funds. After the luncheon, the Mayor handed Mr.\r\nPhelan his transportation, but later in the afternoon Mr. Phelan,\r\nsuspicious of his purpose, sent word to the Mayor that he had decided to\r\nremain in the city. He remained behind to protect the funds.\r\n\r\nAs subsequently developed in the graft investigations, the Supervisors\r\nhad accused the Mayor of abandoning the city government to his enemies,\r\nand insisted upon the enjoyment of all the rights and privileges of\r\ntheir office, and that the work of distributing relief at that time was\r\nthe principal business of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n          RECEIPTS AND DISBURSEMENTS OF PROSECUTION FROM\r\n                 JUNE, 1906, TO MAY 17, 1909\r\n\r\n      (As shown by testimony taken at trial of Patrick Calhoun.)\r\n\r\n                           RECEIPTS.\r\n\r\n     Subscription account                            $ 73,384.75\r\n     Subscription account R.

Footnote 427 refers to \"Chapter\r\nXV 'The Ford Trials'.\" Chapter XX is entitled \"The Ford Trials and\r\nAcquittals\". The apparent reference, however, may be to a separate\r\nvolume, so it has been retained.\r\n\r\nSome words are spelled multiple ways (e.g. 'indorse'/'endorse',\r\n'employe'/'employee', 'Beaney'/'Beany'). These variants are retained.\r\nSome words (e.g. 'increditably' for 'incredibly') are likely mistakes\r\nand are corrected and noted. The author regularly elides the second 'l'\r\nin words like 'wilfully' and 'skilfully'. Where the word (e.g.,\r\n'subpoenaes') appears in quoted material, it appears as printed.\r\n\r\n'Pittsburg' (PA), without the ending 'h' is left as printed, since the\r\nletter had been officially removed in 1890, but was restored only in\r\n1911 as this text was being written.\r\n\r\nHyphenation is also somewhat irregular. Occurrences of hyphens at line\r\nbreaks are resolved according to other instances in the text, or if\r\nthere are none, in accordance with modern usage.\r\n\r\nThe following list includes apparent errors found in the original text.\r\nWhere there is an obvious typographical error, as opposed to a spelling\r\nvariant, the correction has been made and appear in the text as like\r\nthis. Where the error occurs in a note, the page referred to is the\r\nlocation of the page where the note begins, though the error may appear\r\nin a continuation on a following page. The [] brackets are used to\r\ndenote the error, either by changing, omitting, adding or reversing\r\ncharacters. A slash (/) denotes the change required to gain a correct\r\nusage.\r\n\r\na[c]count (33 n30); proper[t]y-owners (39, n28); fi[r]st (103, n108);\r\nany felony or [or/of] any misdemeanors (107, n113); Commis[s]ioner (112\r\nn120); el[e]cting (127 n140); intere[r/s]ts (182 n204); convi[n]ction\r\n(221 n239); bri[k/b]e-taking (231 n251); incredi[ta]bly (256);\r\nassoc[i]ates (273); seriou[t/s] (276); I though[t] it was (291);\r\nsta[u]nchly (305); dum[b]founded (326); hundr[e]d (351, n354);\r\noffer[i]ng (338 n360); dir[e]ct (342 n368); kidnap[p]ing (379 n415);\r\nadvan[at/ta]ge (390 n424); embar[r]assment (426 n458); an[n]ouncement\r\n(428 n461); parol[l]ed (441); poli[ti]cal (459); testimo[u/n]y (xxxiv);\r\nstation[a/e]ry (xxxv); [a/A] uto Livery (xxxv)\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of punctuation corrections, where the printed\r\nimage is ambiguous, or simply wrong, in favor of correct usage.
