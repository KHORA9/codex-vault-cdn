Notes\r\nby Dr. James A. Robertson (Librarian of the Philippine Library and\r\nco-editor of the 55-volume series of historical reprints well called\r\nThe Philippine Islands 1493-1898, so comprehensive are they) show\r\nthe breadth of Rizal's historical scholarship, and that the only error\r\nmentioned is due to using a faulty reprint where the original was\r\nnot available indicates the conscientiousness of the pioneer worker.\r\n\r\nAn appropriate setting has been attempted by page decorations whose\r\nscenes are taken from Philippine textbooks of the World Book Company\r\nand whose borders were made in the Drawing Department of the Philippine\r\nSchool of Arts and Trades.\r\n\r\nThe frontispiece shows a hurried pencil sketch of himself which\r\nRizal made in Berlin in the Spring of 1887 that Prof. Blumentritt,\r\nwhom then he knew only through correspondence, might recognize him at\r\nthe Leitmeritz railway station when he should arrive for a proposed\r\nvisit. The photograph from which the engraving was reproduced came\r\none year ago with the Christmas greetings of the Austrian professor\r\nwhose recent death the Philippine Islands, who knew him as their\r\nfriend and Rizal's, is mourning.\r\n\r\nThe picture perhaps deserves a couple of comments. As a child Rizal\r\nhad been trained to rapid work, an expertness kept up by practice, and\r\nthe copying of his own countenance from a convenient near-by mirror\r\nwas but a moment's task. Yet the incident suggests that he did not\r\nkeep photographs of himself about, and that he had the Cromwellian\r\ndesire to see himself as he really was, for the Filipino features\r\nare more prominent than in any photograph of his extant.\r\n\r\nThe essay itself originally appeared in the Filipino forthrightly\r\nreview, La Solidaridad, of Madrid, in five installments, running\r\nfrom July 15 to September 15, 1890. It was a continuation of Rizal's\r\ncampaign of education in which he sought by blunt truths to awaken his\r\ncountrymen to their own faults at the same time that he was arousing\r\nthe Spaniards to the defects in Spain's colonial system that caused\r\nand continued such shortcomings.\r\n\r\nTo-day there seems a place in Manila for just suets, missionary work\r\nas The Indolence of the Filipino aimed at. It may help on the present\r\nimproving understanding between Continental Americans and their\r\ncountrymen of these \"Far Off Eden Isles\", for the writer submits as\r\nhis mature opinion, based on ten years' acquaintance among Filipinos\r\nthrough studies which enlisted their interest, that the political\r\nproblem would have been greatly simplified had it been understood\r\nin Dewey's day that among intelligent Americans the much-talked-of\r\nlack of \"capacity\" referred to the mass of the people's want of\r\npolitical experience and not to any alleged racial inferiority. To\r\nwounded pride has the discontent been due rather than to withholding\r\nof political privileges.\r\n\r\nSpanish Philippine history has curiously repeated itself during the\r\nfifteen years of America's administration of this archipelago.\r\n\r\nJust as some colonial Spaniards seemed to the Filipinos less\r\ncreditable representatives of the metropolis than the average of\r\nthose who remained in the Peninsula, so not all who now pass for\r\nAmericans in the Philippines are believed here to measure up to the\r\nhighest homestandard.\r\n\r\nSitters in swivel-chairs underneath electric fans hold hopeless the\r\nfuture of the land where men do not desire to be drudges just as did\r\ntheir predecessors who in wide armed lazy seats, beneath punkahs,\r\ntalked of Filipino indolence.\r\n\r\nIngratitude, to-day as then, is the regular rejoinder to the\r\nprogressing people's protest against paternalism, and altruistic\r\nregard for their real welfare is still represented as the reason why\r\nspecial legislation should be provided when Filipinos prefer the same\r\nlaws as govern the sovereign people.\r\n\r\nThough those who claim to champion the Philippines' cause apparently\r\nare unaware of it, these Islands have a population strangely alike in\r\nits make up to the people of America; their history is full of American\r\nassociations; Americans developed their leading resources, and American\r\nideas have inspired their political aspirations. It betrays blindness\r\nsomewhere that ever since 1898 Filipinos have been trying to get loose\r\nfrom America in order to set up here an American form of government,\r\n\r\nThere seems now a, prospect that insular legislation may make available\r\nto the individual the guarantees of personal liberty upon which America\r\nat home prides itself, that municipal self-government and provincial\r\nautonomy may become realities in the Philippines, and possibly even\r\nthat both Filipinos and Americans may realize before it is too late\r\nhow our elastic territorial government could be made to exact from\r\nthem much less of their independence than the sacrifice of sovereignty\r\nnecessary in Neutralization or internationalization.\r\n\r\nUnwillingness to work when there is nothing in it for them\r\nis common to Filipinos and Americans, for Thomas Jefferson\r\nadmitted that extravagance and indolence were the chief faults\r\nof his countrymen. Labor-saving machinery has made the fruits of\r\nAmericans' labors in their land of abundance afford a luxury in\r\nliving not elsewhere existing. But the Filipino, in his rich and not\r\nover-populated home, shutting out, as we do, oriental cheap labor,\r\nmay employ American machinery and attain the same standard. The\r\npossibilities for the prosperity of the population put the Philippines\r\nin the New World, just as their discovery and their history group\r\nthem with the Western Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nAustin Craig,\r\n\r\nUniversity of the Philippines,\r\n\r\nManila, December 20th, 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nDOCTOR Sancianco, in his Progreso de Filipinas, (1), has taken up\r\nthis question, agitated, as he calls it, and, relying upon facts and\r\nreports furnished by the very same Spanish authorities that rule the\r\nPhilippines, has demonstrated that such indolence does not exist, and\r\nthat all said about it does not deserve reply or even passing notice.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as discussion of it has been continued, not only\r\nby government employees who make it responsible for their own\r\nshortcomings, not only by the friars who regard it as necessary in\r\norder that they may continue to represent, themselves as indispensable,\r\nbut also by serious and disinterested persons; and as evidence\r\nof greater or less weight may be adduced in opposition to that\r\nwhich Dr. Sancianco cites, it seems expedient, to us to study this\r\nquestion thoroughly, without superciliousness or sensitiveness,\r\nwithout prejudice, without pessimism. And as we can only serve our\r\ncountry by telling the truth, however bit, tee it be, just as a\r\nflat and skilful negation cannot refute a real and positive fact,\r\nin spite of the brilliance of the arguments; as a mere affirmation is\r\nnot sufficient to create something impossible, let us calmly examine\r\nthe facts, using on our part all the impartiality of which a man\r\nis capable who is convinced that there is no redemption except upon\r\nsolid bases of virtue.\r\n\r\nThe word indolence has been greatly misused in the sense of little\r\nlove for work and lack of energy, while ridicule has concealed the\r\nmisuse. This much-discussed question has met with the same fate as\r\ncertain panaceas and specifies of the quacks who by ascribing to them\r\nimpossible virtues have discredited them. In the Middle Ages, and even\r\nin some Catholic countries now, the devil is blamed for everything that\r\nsuperstitious folk cannot understand or the perversity of mankind is\r\nloath to confess. In the Philippines one's own and another's faults,\r\nthe shortcomings of one, the misdeeds of another, are attributed to\r\nindolence. And just as in the Middle Ages he who sought the explanation\r\nof phenomena outside of infernal influences was persecuted, so in the\r\nPhilippines worse happens to him who seeks the origin of the trouble\r\noutside of accepted beliefs.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of this misuse is that there are some who are\r\ninterested in stating it as a dogma and others in combating it as a\r\nridiculous superstition, if not a punishable delusion. Yet it is not\r\nto be inferred from the misuse of a thing that it does not exist.\r\n\r\nWe think that there must be something behind all this outcry, for it\r\nis incredible that so many should err, among whom we have said there\r\nare a lot of serious and disinterested persons. Some act in bad faith,\r\nthrough levity, through want of sound judgment, through limitation\r\nin reasoning power, ignorance of the past, or other cause. Some repeat\r\nwhat they have heard, without, examination or reflection; others speak\r\nthrough pessimism or are impelled by that human characteristic which\r\npaints as perfect everything that belongs to oneself and defective\r\nwhatever belongs to another. But it cannot be denied that there are\r\nsome who worship truth, or if not truth itself at least the semblance\r\nthereof, which is truth in the mind of the crowd.\r\n\r\nExamining well, then, all the scenes and all the men that we have\r\nknown from Childhood, and the life of our country, we believe that\r\nindolence does exist there. The Filipinos, who can measure up with the\r\nmost active peoples in the world, will doubtless not repudiate this\r\nadmission, for it is true that there one works and struggles against\r\nthe climate, against nature and against men. But we must not take the\r\nexception for the general rule, and should rather seek the good of our\r\ncountry by stating what we believe to be true. We must confess that\r\nindolence does actually and positively exist there; only that, instead\r\nof holding it to be the cause of the backwardness and the trouble,\r\nwe regard it as the effect of the trouble and the backwardness,\r\nby fostering the development of a lamentable predisposition.\r\n\r\nThose who have as yet treated of indolence, with the exception of\r\nDr. Sancianco, have been content to deny or affirm it. We know of no\r\none who has studied its causes. Nevertheless, those who admit its\r\nexistence and exaggerate it more or less have not therefore failed\r\nto advise remedies taken from here and there, from Java, from India,\r\nfrom other English or Dutch colonies, like the quack who saw a fever\r\ncured with a dozen sardines and afterwards always prescribed these\r\nfish at every rise in temperature that he discovered in his patients.\r\n\r\nWe shall proceed otherwise. Before proposing a remedy we shall examine\r\nthe causes, and even though strictly speaking a predisposition is not\r\na cause, let us, however, study at its true value this predisposition\r\ndue to nature.\r\n\r\nThe predisposition exists? Why shouldn't it?\r\n\r\nA hot, climate requires of the individual quiet and rest, just as\r\ncold incites to labor and action. For this reason the Spaniard is\r\nmore indolent than the Frenchman; the Frenchman more so than the\r\nGerman. The Europeans themselves who reproach the residents of the\r\ncolonies so much (and I am not now speaking of the Spaniards but of\r\nthe Germans and English themselves), how do they live in tropical\r\ncountries? Surrounded by a numerous train of servants, never going\r\nafoot but riding in a carriage, needing servants not only to take\r\noff their shoes for them but even to fan them! And yet they live and\r\neat better, they work for themselves to get rich, with the hope of\r\na future, free and respected, while the poor colonist, the indolent\r\ncolonist, is badly nourished, has no hope, toils for others, and\r\nworks under force and compulsion! Perhaps the reply to this will be\r\nthat white men are not made to stand the severity of the climate. A\r\nmistake! A man can live in any climate, if he will only adapt himself\r\nto its requirements and conditions. What kills the European in hot\r\ncountries is the abuse of liquors, the attempt to live according to\r\nthe nature of his own country under another sky and another sun. We\r\ninhabitants of hot countries live well in northern Europe whenever\r\nwe take the precautions the people there do. Europeans can also stand\r\nthe torrid zone, if only they would get rid of their prejudices. (2)\r\nThe fact is that in tropical countries violent work is not a good\r\nthing as it is in cold countries, there it is death, destruction,\r\nannihilation. Nature knows this and like a just mother has therefore\r\nmade the earth more fertile, more productive, as a compensation. An\r\nhour's work under that burning sun, in the midst of pernicious\r\ninfluences springing from nature in activity, is equal to a day's\r\nwork in a temperate climate; it is, then, just that the earth yield\r\na hundred fold! Moreover, do we not see the active European, who has\r\ngained strength during the winter, who feels the fresh blood of spring\r\nboil in his veins, do we not see him abandon his labors during the\r\nfew days of his variable summer, close his office--where the work\r\nis not violent and amounts for many to talking and gesticulating in\r\nthe shade and beside a lunch-stand,--flee to watering  places, sit\r\nin the cafés or stroll about? What wonder then that the inhabitant\r\nof tropical countries, worm out and with his blood thinned by the\r\ncontinuous and excessive heat, is reduced to inaction? Who is the\r\nindolent one in the Manila offices? Is it the poor clerk who comes\r\nin at eight in the morning and leaves at, one in the afternoon with\r\nonly his parasol, who copies and writes and works for himself and\r\nfor his chief, or is it the chief, who comes in a carriage at ten\r\no'clock, leaves before twelve, reads his newspaper while smoking and\r\nwith is feet cocked up on a chair or a table, or gossiping about all\r\nhis friends? Which is indolent, the native coadjutor, poorly paid\r\nand badly treated, who has to visit all the indigent sick living in\r\nthe country, or the friar curate who gets fabulously rich, goes about\r\nin a carriage, eats and drinks well, and does not put himself to any\r\ntrouble without collecting excessive fees? [3]\r\n\r\nWithout speaking further of the Europeans, in what violent labor does\r\nthe Chinaman engage in tropical countries, the industrious Chinaman,\r\nwho flees from his own country driven by hunger and want, and whose\r\nwhole ambition is to amass a small fortune? With the exception of some\r\nporters, an occupation that the natives also follow, he nearly always\r\nengages in trade, in commerce; so rarely does he take up agriculture\r\nthat we do not know of a single case. The Chinaman who in other\r\ncolonies cultivates the soil does so only for a certain number of\r\nyears and then retires. [4]\r\n\r\nWe find, then, the tendency to indolence very natural, and have to\r\nadmit and bless it, for we cannot alter natural laws, and without\r\nit the race would have disappeared. Man is not a brute, he is not\r\na, machine; his object is not merely to produce, in spite of the\r\npretensions of some Christian whites who would make of the colored\r\nChristian a kind of motive power somewhat more intelligent and less\r\ncostly than steam. Man's object is not to satisfy tile passions of\r\nanother man, his object is to seek happiness for himself and his kind\r\nby traveling along the road of progress and perfection.\r\n\r\nThe evil is not that indolence exists more or less latently but that\r\nit is fostered and magnified. Among men, as well as among nations,\r\nthere exist not only aptitudes but also tendencies toward good and\r\nevil. To foster the good ones and aid them, as well as correct the\r\nevil and repress them, would be the duty of society and governments,\r\nif less noble thoughts did not occupy their attention. The evil is\r\nthat the indolence in the Philippines is a magnified indolence, an\r\nindolence of the snowball type, if we may be permitted the expression,\r\nan evil that increases in direct proportion to the square of the\r\nperiods of time, an effect of misgovernment and of backwardness,\r\nas we said, and not a cause thereof. Others will hold the contrary\r\nopinion, especially those who have a hand in the misgovernment, but\r\nwe do not care; we have made an assertion and are going to prove it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWhen in consequence of a long chronic illness the condition of the\r\npatient is examined, the question may arise whether the weakening\r\nof the fibers and the debility of the organs are the cause of the\r\nmalady's continuing or the effect of the bad treatment that prolongs\r\nits action. The attending physician attributes the entire failure of\r\nhis skill to the poor constitution of the patient, to the climate, to\r\nthe surroundings, and so on. On the other hand, the patient attributes\r\nthe aggravation of the evil to the system of treatment followed. Only\r\nthe common crowd, the inquisitive populace, shakes its head and cannot\r\nreach a decision.\r\n\r\nSomething like this happens in the case of the Philippines. Instead of\r\nphysician, read government, that is, friars, employees, etc. Instead\r\nof patient, Philippines; instead of malady, indolence.\r\n\r\nAnd, just as happens in similar cases then the patient gets worse,\r\neverybody loses his head, each one dodges the responsibility to place\r\nit upon somebody else, and instead of seeking the causes in order\r\nto combat the evil in them, devotes himself at best to attacking\r\nthe symptoms: here a blood-letting, a tax; there a plaster, forced\r\nlabor; further on a sedative, a trifling reform. Every new arrival\r\nproposes a new remedy: one, seasons of prayer, the relics of a saint,\r\nthe viaticum, the friars; another, a shower-bath; still another, with\r\npretensions to modern ideas, a transfusion of blood. \"It's nothing,\r\nonly the patient has eight million indolent red corpuscles: some few\r\nwhite corpuscles in the form of an agricultural colony will get us\r\nout of the trouble.\"\r\n\r\nSo, on all sides there are groans, gnawing of lips, clenching of fists,\r\nmany hollow words, great ignorance, a deal of talk, a lot of fear. The\r\npatient is near his finish!\r\n\r\nYes, transfusion of blood, transfusion of blood! New life, new\r\nvitality! Yes, the new white corpuscles that you are going to\r\ninject into its veins, the new white corpuscles that were a cancer\r\nin another organism will withstand all the depravity of the system,\r\nwill withstand the blood-lettings that it suffers every day, will\r\nhave more stamina than all the eight million red corpuscles, will\r\ncure all the disorders, all the degeneration, all the trouble in the\r\nprincipal organs. Be thankful if they do not become coagulations and\r\nproduce gangrene, be thankful if they do not reproduce the cancer!\r\n\r\nWhile the patient breathes, we must not lose hope, and however late we\r\nbe, a judicious examination is never superfluous; at least the cause\r\nof death may be known. We are not trying to put all the blame on the\r\nphysician, and still less on the patient, for we have already spoken\r\nof a predisposition due to the climate, a reasonable and natural\r\npredisposition, in the absence of which the race would disappear,\r\nsacrificed to excessive labor in a tropical country.\r\n\r\nIndolence in the Philippines is a chronic malady, but not a hereditary\r\none. The Filipinos have not always been what they are, witnesses\r\nwhereto are all the historians of the first years after the discovery\r\nof the Islands.\r\n\r\nBefore the arrival of the Europeans, the Malayan Filipinos carried\r\non an active trade, not only among themselves but also with all the\r\nneighboring countries. A Chinese manuscript of the 13th century,\r\ntranslated by Dr. Hirth (Globus, Sept. 1889), which we will take\r\nup at another time, speaks of China's relations with the islands,\r\nrelations purely commercial, in which mention is made of the activity\r\nand honesty of the traders of Luzon, who took the Chinese products\r\nand distributed them throughout all the islands, traveling for nine\r\nmonths, and then returned to pay religiously even for the merchandise\r\nthat the Chinamen did not remember to have given them. The products\r\nwhich they in exchange exported from the islands were crude wax,\r\ncotton, pearls, tortoise-shell, betel-nuts, dry-goods, etc. [5]\r\n\r\nThe first thing noticed by Pigafetta, who came with Magellan in 1521,\r\non arriving at the first island of the Philippines, Samar, was the\r\ncourtesy and kindness of the inhabitants and their commerce. \"To honor\r\nour captain,\" he says, \"they conducted him to their boats where they\r\nhad their merchandise, which consisted of cloves, cinnamon, pepper,\r\nnutmegs, mace, gold and other things; and they made us understand by\r\ngestures that such articles were to be found in the islands to which\r\nwe were going.\" [6]\r\n\r\nFurther on he speaks of the vessels and utensils of solid gold that he\r\nfound in Butuan, where the people worked mines. He describes the silk\r\ndresses, the daggers with long gold hilts and scabbards of carved wood,\r\nthe gold, sets of teeth, etc. Among cereals and fruits he mentions\r\nrice, millet, oranges, lemons, panicum, etc.\r\n\r\nThat the islands maintained relations with neighboring countries and\r\neven with distant ones is proven by the ships from Siam, laden with\r\ngold and slaves, that Magellan found in Cebu. These ships paid certain\r\nduties to the King of the island. In the same year, 1521, the survivors\r\nof Magellan's expedition met the son of the Rajah of Luzon, who,\r\nas captain-general of the Sultan of Borneo and admiral of his fleet,\r\nhad conquered for him the great city of Lave (Sarawak?). Might this\r\ncaptain, who was greatly feared by all his foes, have been the Rajah\r\nMatanda whom the Spaniards afterwards encountered in Tondo in 1570?\r\n\r\nIn 1539 the warriors of Luzon took part in the formidable contests\r\nof Sumatra, and under the orders of Angi Siry Timor, Rajah of Batta,\r\nconquered and overthrew the terrible Alzadin, Sultan of Atchin,\r\nrenowned in the historical annals of the Far East. (Marsden, Hist. of\r\nSumatra, Chap. XX.) (7)\r\n\r\nAt that time, that sea where float the islands like a set of emeralds\r\non a paten of bright glass, that sea was everywhere traversed by junks,\r\nparaus, barangays, vintas, vessels swift as shuttles, so large that\r\nthey could maintain a hundred rowers on a side (Morga;) that sea\r\nbore everywhere commerce, industry, agriculture, by the force of the\r\noars moved to the sound of warlike songs (8) of the genealogies and\r\nachievements of the Philippine divinities. (Colin, Chap. XV.) (9)\r\n\r\nWealth abounded in the islands. Pigafetta tells us of the abundance\r\nof foodstuffs in Paragua and of its inhabitants, who nearly all\r\ntilled their own fields. At this island the survivors of Magellan's\r\nexpedition were well received and provisioned. A little later, these\r\nsame survivors captured a vessel, plundered and sacked it, add took\r\nprisoner in it the chief of the Island of Paragua (!) with his son\r\nand brother. (10)\r\n\r\nIn this same vessel they captured bronze lombards, and this is the\r\nfirst mention of artillery of the Filipinos, for these lombards were\r\nuseful to the chief of Paragua against the savages of the interior.\r\n\r\nThey let him ransom himself within seven days, demanding 400 measures\r\n(cavanes?) of rice, 20 pigs, 20 goats, and 450 chickens. This is the\r\nfirst act of piracy recorded in Philippine history. The chief of\r\nParagua paid everything, and moreover voluntarily added coconuts,\r\nbananas, and sugar-cane jars filled with palm-wine. When Caesar\r\nwas taken prisoner by the corsairs and required to pay twenty five\r\ntalents ransom, he replied; \"I'll give you fifty, but later I'll\r\nhave you all crucified!\" The chief of Paragua was more generous: he\r\nforgot. His conduct, while it may reveal weakness, also demonstrates\r\nthat the islands were abundantly provisioned. This chief was named\r\nTuan Mahamud; his brother, Guantil, and his son, Tuan Mahamed. (Martin\r\nMendez, Purser of the ship Victoria: Archivos de Indias.)\r\n\r\nA very extraordinary thing, and one that shows the facility with\r\nwhich the natives learned Spanish, is that fifty years before the\r\narrival of the Spaniards in Luzon, in that very year 1521 when they\r\nfirst came to the islands, there were already natives of Luzon who\r\nunderstood Castilian. In the treaties of peace that the survivors\r\nof Magellan's expedition made with the chief of Paragua, when the\r\nservant-interpreter died they communicated with one another through\r\na Moro who had been captured in the island of the King of Luzon and\r\nwho understood some Spanish. (Martin Mendez, op, cit ) Where did\r\nthis extemporaneous interpreter learn Castilian? In the Moluccas? In\r\nMalacca, with the Portuguese? Spaniards did not reach Luzon until 1571.\r\n\r\nLegazpi's expedition met in Butuan various traders of Luzon with\r\ntheir boats laden with iron, wax cloths, porcelain, etc. (Gaspar de\r\nSan Agustin,) plenty of provisions, activity, trade, movement in all\r\nthe southern islands. (11)\r\n\r\nThey arrived at the Island of Cebu, \"abounding in provisions, with\r\nmines and washings of gold, and peopled with natives,\" as Morga says;\r\n\"very populous, and at a port frequented by many ships that came\r\nfrom the islands and kingdoms near India,\" as Colin says; and even\r\nthough they were peacefully received discord soon arose. The city was\r\ntaken by force and burned. The fire destroyed the food supplies and\r\nnaturally famine broke out in that town of a hundred thousand people,\r\n(12) as the historians say, and among the members of the expedition,\r\nbut the neighboring islands quickly relieved the need, thanks to the\r\nabundance they enjoyed.\r\n\r\nAll the histories of those first years, in short, abound in long\r\naccounts about the industry and agriculture of the natives: mines,\r\ngold-washings, looms, farms, barter, naval construction, raising\r\nof poultry and stock, weaving of silk and cotton, distilleries,\r\nmanufactures of arms, pearl fisheries, the civet industry, the horn\r\nand hide industry, etc., are things encountered at every step, and,\r\nconsidering the time and the conditions in the islands, prove that\r\nthere was life, there was activity, there was movement.\r\n\r\nAnd if this, which is deduction, does not convince any minds imbued\r\nwith unfair prejudices, perhaps of some avail may be the testimony of\r\nthe oft-quoted Dr. Morga, who was Lieutenant-Governor of Manila for\r\nseven years and after rendering great service in the Archipelago was\r\nappointed criminal judge of the Audiencia of Mexico and Counsellor\r\nof the Inquisition. His testimony, we say, is highly credible, not\r\nonly because all his contemporaries have spoken of him in terms that\r\nborder on veneration but also because his work, from which we take\r\nthese citations, is written with great circumspection and care, as well\r\nwith reference to the authorities in the Philippines as to the errors\r\nthey committed. \"The natives,\" says Morga, in chapter VII, speaking of\r\nthe occupations of the Chinese, \"are very far from exercising those\r\ntrades and have even forgotten much about farming, raising poultry,\r\nstock and cotton, and weaving cloth AS THEY USED TO DO IN THEIR\r\nPAGANISM AND FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THE COUNTRY WAS CONQUERED.\" (13)\r\n\r\nThe whole of chapter VIII of his work deals with this moribund\r\nactivity, this much-forgotten industry, and yet in spite of that,\r\nhow long is his eighth chapter!\r\n\r\nAnd not only Morga, not only Chirino, Colin, Argensola, Gaspar de San\r\nAgustin and others agree in this matter, but modern travelers, after\r\ntwo hundred and fifty years, examining the decadence and misery,\r\nassert the same thing. Dr. Hans Meyer, when he saw the unsubdued\r\ntribes cultivating beautiful fields and working energetically, asked\r\nif they would not become indolent when they in turn should accept\r\nChristianity and a paternal government.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Filipinos, in spite of the climate, in spite of\r\ntheir few needs (they were less then than now), were not the indolent\r\ncreatures of our time, and, as we shall see later on, their ethics\r\nand their mode of life were not what is now complacently attributed\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nHow then, and in what way, was that active and enterprising infidel\r\nnative of ancient times converted into the lazy and indolent Christian,\r\nas our contemporary writer's say?\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken of the more or less latent predisposition\r\nwhich exists in the Philippines toward indolence, and which must\r\nexist everywhere, in the whole world, in all men, because we all\r\nhate work more or less, as it may be more or less hard, more or less\r\nunproductive. The dolce far niente of the Italian, the rascarse la\r\nbarriga of the Spaniard, the supreme aspiration of the bourgeois to\r\nlive on his income in peace and tranquility, attest this.\r\n\r\nWhat causes operated to awake this terrible predisposition from its\r\nlethargy? How is it that the Filipino people, so fond of its customs\r\nas to border on routine, has given up its ancient habits of work,\r\nof trade, of navigation, etc., even to the extent of completely\r\nforgetting its past?\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nA fatal combination of circumstances, some independent of the will\r\nin spite of men's efforts, others the offspring of stupidity and\r\nignorance, others the inevitable corollaries of false principles, and\r\nstill others the result of more or less base passions has induced the\r\ndecline of labor, an evil which instead of being remedied by prudence,\r\nmature reflection and recognition of the mistakes made, through\r\ndeplorable policy, through regret, table blindness and obstinacy,\r\nhas gone from bad to worse until it has reached the condition in\r\nwhich we now see it. (14).\r\n\r\nFirst came the wars, the internal disorders which the new change\r\nof affairs naturally brought with it. It was necessary to subject\r\nthe people either by cajolery or force; there were fights, there was\r\nslaughter; those who had submitted peacefully seemed to repent of it;\r\ninsurrections were suspected, and some occurred; naturally there\r\nwere executions, and many capable laborers perished. Add to this\r\ncondition of disorder the invasion of Limahong, add the continual\r\nwars into which the inhabitants of the Philippines were plunged\r\nto maintain the honor of Spain, to extend the sway of her flag in\r\nBorneo, in the Moluccas and in Indo-China; to repel the Dutch foe:\r\ncostly wars, fruitless expeditions, in which each time thousands and\r\nthousands of native archers and rowers were recorded to have embarked,\r\nbut whether they returned to their homes was never stated. Like the\r\ntribute that once upon a time Greece sent to the Minotaur of Crete,\r\nthe Philippine youth embarked for the expedition, saying good-by to\r\ntheir country forever: on their horizon were the stormy sea, the\r\ninterminable wars, the rash expeditions. Wherefore, Gaspar de San\r\nAgustin says: \"Although anciently there were in this town of Dumangas\r\nmany people, in the course of time they have very greatly diminished\r\nbecause the natives are the best sailors and most skillful rowers\r\non the whole coast, and so the governors in the port of Iloilo take\r\nmost of the people from this town for the ships that they send abroad\r\n............. When the Spaniards reached this island (Panay) it is\r\nsaid that there were on it more than fifty thousand families; but\r\nthese diminished greatly; ........... and at present they may amount\r\nto some fourteen thousand tributaries.\" From fifty thousand families\r\nto fourteen thousand tributaries in little over half a century!\r\n\r\nWe would never get through, had we to quote all the evidence of the\r\nauthors regarding the frightful diminution of the inhabitants of the\r\nPhilippines in the first years after the discovery. In the time of\r\ntheir first bishop, that is, ten years after Legazpi, Philip II said\r\nthat they had been reduced to less than two thirds.\r\n\r\nAdd to these fatal expeditions that wasted all the moral and material\r\nenergies of the country, the frightful inroads of the terrible pirates\r\nfrom the south, instigated and encouraged by the government, first in\r\norder to get complaint and afterwards disarm the islands subjected to\r\nit, inroads that reached the very shores of Manila, even Malate itself,\r\nand during which were seen to set out for captivity and slavery,\r\nin the baleful glow of burning villages, strings of wretches who had\r\nbeen unable to defend themselves, leaving behind them the ashes of\r\ntheir homes and the corpses of their parents and children. Morga,\r\nwho recounts the first piratical invasion, says: \"The boldness of\r\nthese people of Mindanao did great damage to the Visayan Islands,\r\nas much by what they did in them as by the fear and fright which the\r\nnative acquired, because the latter were in the power of the Spaniards,\r\nwho held them subject and tributary and unarmed, in such manner that\r\nthey did not protect them from their enemies or leave them means with\r\nwhich to defend themselves, AS THEY DID WHEN THERE WERE NO SPANIARDS\r\nIN THE COUNTRY.\" These piratical attacks continually reduced the\r\nnumber of the inhabitants of the Philippines, since the independent\r\nMalays were especially notorious for their atrocities and murders,\r\nsometimes because they believed that to preserve their independence\r\nit was necessary to weaken the Spaniard by reducing the number of his\r\nsubjects, sometimes because a greater hatred and a deeper resentment\r\ninspired them against the Christian Filipinos who, being of the their\r\nown race, served the stranger in order to deprive them of their\r\nprecious liberty. These expeditions lasted about three centuries,\r\nbeing repeated five and ten times a year, and each expedition cost\r\nthe islands over eight hundred prisoners.\r\n\r\n\"With the invasions of the pirates from Sulu and Mindanao,\" says\r\nPadre Gaspar de San Agustin, [the island of Bantayan, near Cebu]\r\n\"has been greatly reduced, because they easily captured the people\r\nthere, since the latter had no place to fortify themselves and were\r\nfar from help from Cebu. The hostile Sulu did great damage in this\r\nisland in 1608, leaving it almost depopulated.\" (Page 380).\r\n\r\nThese rough attacks, coming from without, produced a counter effect,\r\nin the interior, which, carrying out medical comparisons, was like\r\na purge or diet in an individual who has just lost a great deal\r\nof blood. In order to make headway against so many calamities, to\r\nsecure their sovereignty and take the offensive in these disastrous\r\ncontests, to isolate the warlike Sulus from their neighbors in the\r\nsouth, to care for the needs of the empire of the Indies (for one of\r\nthe reasons why the Philippines were kept, as contemporary documents\r\nprove, was their strategic position between New Spain and the Indies),\r\nto wrest from the Dutch their growing colonies of the Moluccas and\r\nget rid of some troublesome neighbors, to maintain, in short, the\r\ntrade of China with New Spain. it was necessary to construct new\r\nand large ships which, as we have seen, costly as they were to the\r\ncountry for their equipment and the rowers they required, were not\r\nless so because of the manner in which they were constructed. (16)\r\nFernando de los Rios Coronel, who fought in these wars and later\r\nturned priest, speaking of these King's ships, said: \"As they were\r\nso large, the timber needed was scarcely to be found in the forests\r\n(of the Philippines!), and thus it was necessary to seek it with great\r\ndifficulty in the most remote of them, where, once found, in order\r\nto haul and convey it to the shipyard the towns of the surrounding\r\ncountry had to be depopulated of natives, who get it out with immense\r\nlabor, damage, and cost to them. The natives furnished the masts for\r\na galleon, according to the assertion of the Franciscans, and I heard\r\nthe governor of the province where they were cut, which is Lacuna de\r\nBay, say that to haul them seven leagues over very broken mountains\r\n6,000 natives were engaged three months, without furnishing them food,\r\nwhich the wretched native had to seek for himself!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Gaspar de San Agustin says: \"In those times (1690), Bacolor has\r\nnot the people that it had in the past, because of the uprising in\r\nthat province when Don Sabiniano Manrique de Lava was Governor of\r\nthese islands and because of the continual labor of cutting timber\r\nfor his Majesty's shipyards, WHICH HINDERS THEM FROM CULTIVATING THE\r\nVERY FERTILE PLAIN THEY HAVE.\" (17)\r\n\r\nIf this is not sufficient to explain the depopulation of the islands\r\nand the abandonment of industry, agriculture and commerce, then\r\nadd \"the natives who wore executed, those who loft their wives and\r\nchildren and fled in disgust to the mountains, those who were sold\r\ninto slavery to pay the taxes levied upon them,\" as Fernando de los\r\nRios Coronel says; add to all this what Philip II said in reprimanding\r\nBishos Salazar about \"natives sold by some encomendoros to others,\r\nthose flogged to death, the women who are crushed to death by their\r\nheavy burdens, those who sleep in the fields and there bear and nurse\r\ntheir children and die bitten by poisonous vermin, the many who are\r\nexecuted and left to die of hunger and those who eat poisonous herbs\r\n............ and the mothers who kill their children in bearing them,\"\r\nand you will understand how in less than thirty years the population\r\nof the Philippines was reduced one-third. We are not saying this:\r\nit was said by Gaspar de San Agustin, the preeminently anti-Filipino\r\nAugustinian, and he confirms it throughout the rest of his work by\r\nspeaking every moment of the state of neglect in which lay the farms\r\nand fields once so flourishing and so well cultivated, the towns\r\nthinned that had formerly been inhabited by many leading families!\r\n\r\nHow is it strange, then, that discouragement may have been infused\r\ninto the spirit of the inhabitants of the Philippines, when in the\r\nmidst of so many calamities they did not know whether they would see\r\nsprout the seed they were planting, whether their field was going to\r\nbe their grave or their crop would go to feed their executioner? What\r\nis there strange in it, when we see the pious but impotent friars of\r\nthat time trying to free their poor parishioners from the tyranny\r\nof the encomenderos by advising them to stop work in the mines,\r\nto abandon their commerce, to break up their looms, pointing out to\r\nthem heaven for their whole hope, preparing them for death as their\r\nonly consolation? (18)\r\n\r\nMan works for an object. Remove the object and you reduce him to\r\ninaction The most active man in the world will fold his arms from\r\nthe instant he understands that it is madness to bestir himself, that\r\nthis work will be the cause of his trouble, that for him it will be\r\nthe cause of vexations at home and of the pirate's greed abroad. It\r\nseems that these thoughts have never entered the minds of those who\r\ncry out against the indolence of the Filipinos.\r\n\r\nEven were the Filipino not a man like the rest; even were we to suppose\r\nthat zeal in him for work was as essential as the movement of a wheel\r\ncaught in the gearing of others in motion; even were we to deny him\r\nforesight and the judgment that the past and the present form, there\r\nwould still be left us another reason to explain the attack of the\r\nevil. The abandonment of the fields by their cultivators, whom the\r\nwars and piratical attacks dragged from their homes was sufficient\r\nto reduce to nothing the hard labor of so many generations. In the\r\nPhilippines abandon for a year the land most beautifully tended and\r\nyou will see how you will have to begin all over again: the rain will\r\nwipe out the furrows, the floods will drown the seeds, plants and\r\nbushes will grow up everywhere, and on seeing so much useless labor\r\nthe hand will drop the hoe, the laborer will desert his plow. Isn't\r\nthere left the fine life of the pirate?\r\n\r\nThus is understood that sad discouragement which we find in the friar\r\nwriters of the 17th century, speaking of once very fertile plains\r\nsubmerged, of provinces and towns depopulated, of products that\r\nhave disappeared from trade, of leading families exterminated. These\r\npages resemble a sad and monotonous scene in the night after a lively\r\nday. Of Cagayan Padre San Agustin speaks with mournful brevity: \"A\r\ngreat deal of cotton, of which they made good cloth that the Chinese\r\nand Japanese every year bought and carried away.\" In the historian's\r\ntime, the industry and the trade had come to an end!\r\n\r\nIt seems that these are causes more thorn sufficient to breed indolence\r\neven in the midst of beehive. Thus is explained why, after thirty-two\r\nyears of the system, the circumspect and prudent Morga said that the\r\nnatives \"have forgotten much about farming, raising poultry, stock\r\nand cotton, and weaving cloth, as they used to do in their paganism\r\nand FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THE COUNTRY HAD BEEN CONQUERED!\"\r\n\r\nStill they struggled a long time against indolence, yes: but their\r\nenemies were so numerous that at last they gave up!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nWe recognize the causes that, awoke the predisposition and provoked the\r\nevil: now let us see what foster and sustain it. In this connection,\r\ngovernment and governed have to bow our heads and say: we deserve\r\nour fate.\r\n\r\nWe have already truly said that when a house becomes disturbed and\r\ndisordered, we should not accuse the youngest, child or the servants,\r\nbut the head of it, especially if his authority is unlimited, he\r\nwho does not act freely is not responsible for his actions; and the\r\nFilipino people, not being master of its liberty, is not responsible\r\nfor either its misfortunes or its woes. We says this, it is true,\r\nbut, as will be seen later on, we also have a large part, in the\r\ncontinuation of such a disorder.\r\n\r\nThe following, among other causes, contributed to foster the evil\r\nand aggravate it: the constantly lessening encouragement that labor\r\nhas met with in the Philippines. Fearing to have the Filipinos deal\r\nfrequently with other individuals of their own race, who were free\r\nand independent, as the Borneans, the Siamese, the Cambodians, and\r\nthe Japanese, people who in their customs and feeling's differ greatly\r\nfrom the Chinese, the Government acted toward these others with great\r\nmistrust and great severity, as Morga testifies in the last pages of\r\nhis work, until they finally ceased to come to the country. In fact,\r\nit seems that once an uprising' planned by the Borneans was suspected:\r\nwe say suspected, for there was not even an attempt, although there\r\nwere many executions. (19) And, as these nations were the very ones\r\nthat, consumed Philippine products, when all communication with them\r\nhad been cut off, consumption of these products also ceased. The only\r\ntwo countries with which the Philippines continued to have relations\r\nwere China and Mexico, or New Spain, and from this trade only China\r\nand a few private individuals in Manila got any benefit. It, fact,\r\nthe Celestial Empire sent, her junks laden with merchandise, that\r\nmerchandise which shut down the factories of Seville and ruined the\r\nSpanish industry, and returned laden in exchange with the silver that\r\nwas every year sent from Mexico. Nothing from the Philippines at that\r\ntime went to China, not even gold, for in those years the Chinese\r\ntraders would accept no payment but silver coin. (20) To Mexico went\r\nlittle more: some cloth and dry goods which the encomendoros took\r\nby force or bought from the natives at, a paltry price, wax, amber,\r\ngold, civet, etc, but nothing more, and not even in great quantity,\r\nas is stated by Admiral Don Jerónimo de Bañuelos y Carrillo, when\r\nhe begged the King that \"the inhabitants of the Manilas be permitted\r\n(!) to load as many ships as they could with native products, such\r\nas wax, gold, perfumes, ivory, cotton cloths, which they would have\r\nto buy from the natives of the country ............... Thus the\r\nfriendship of those peoples would be gained, they would furnish New\r\nSpain with their merchandise and the money that is brought to Manila,\r\nwould not leave this place,\" (21)\r\n\r\nThe coastwise trade, so active in other times, had to die out, thanks\r\nto the piratical attacks of the Malays of the south; and trade in\r\nthe interior of the islands almost entirely disappeared, owing to\r\nrestrictions, passports and other administrative requirements.\r\n\r\nOf no little importance were the hindrances and obstacles that from\r\nthe beginning were thrown in the farmers's way by the rulers, who were\r\ninfluenced by childish fear and saw everywhere signs of conspiracies\r\nand uprisings. The natives were not allowed to go to their labors,\r\nthat is, their farms, without permission of the governor, or of his\r\nagents and officers, and even of the priests as Morga says. Those who\r\nknow the administrative slackness and confusion in a country where the\r\nofficials work scarcely two hours a day; those who know the cost of\r\ngoing to and returning from the capital to obtain a permit; those who\r\nare aware of the petty retaliations of the little tyrants will well\r\nunderstand how with this crude arrangement it is possible to have the\r\nmost absurd agriculture. True it is that for some time this absurdity,\r\nwhich would be ludicrous had it not been so serious, has disappeared;\r\nbut even if the words have gone out of use other facts and other\r\nprovisions have replaced them. The Moro pirate has disappeared but\r\nthere remains the outlaw who infests the fields and waylays the farmer\r\nto hold him for ransom. Now then, the government, which has a constant\r\nfear of the people, denies to the farmers even the use of a shotgun,\r\nor if it does allow it does so very grudgingly and withdraws it at\r\npleasure; whence it results with the laborer, who, thanks to his means\r\nof defense, plants his crops and invests his meager fortune in the\r\nfurrows that he has so laboriously opened, that when his crop matures,\r\nit occurs to the government, which is impotent to suppress brigandage,\r\nto deprive him of his weapon; and then, without defense and without\r\nsecurity he is reduced to inaction and abandons his field, his work,\r\nand takes to gambling as the best means of securing a livelihood. The\r\ngreen cloth is under the protection of the government, it is safer! A\r\nmournful counselor is fear, for it not only causes weakness but also\r\nin casting aside the weapons strengthens the very persecutor!\r\n\r\nThe sordid return the native gets from his work has the effect of\r\ndiscouraging him. We know from history that the encomenderos, after\r\nreducing many to slavery and forcing them to work for their benefit,\r\nmade others give up their merchandise for a trifle or nothing at all,\r\nor cheated them with false measures.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Ipion, in Panay, Padre Gaspar de San Agustin says:\r\n\"It was in ancient times very rich in gold, ............... but\r\nprovoked by the annoyances they suffered from some governors they have\r\nceased to get it out, preferring to live in poverty than to suffer\r\nsuch hardships.\" (Page 378). Further on, speaking of other towns,\r\nhe says: \"Goaded by the ill treatment of the encomenderos who in\r\nadministering justice have treated the natives as their slaves and\r\nnot as their children, and have only looked after their own interests\r\nat the expense of the wretched fortunes and lives of their charges\r\n...............\" (Page 422) Further on: \"In Leyte, where they tried\r\nto kill an encomendero of the town of Dagami on account of the great\r\nhardships he made them suffer by exacting tribute of wax from them\r\nwith a steelyard which he had made twice as long as the others\"\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs lasted a long time and still lasts, in spite of\r\nthe fact, that the breed of encomenderos has become extinct. A term\r\npasses away but the evil and the passions engendered do not pass away\r\nso long as reforms are devoted solely to changing the names.\r\n\r\nThe wars with the Dutch, the inroads and piratical attacks of the\r\npeople of Sulu and Mindanao disappeared; the people have been\r\ntransformed; new towns have grown up while others have become\r\nimpoverished; but the frauds subsist as much as or worse than they\r\ndid in those early years. We will not cite our own experiences, for\r\naside from the fact that, we do not know which to select, critical\r\npersons may reproach us with partiality; neither will we cite those\r\nof other Filipinos who write in the newspapers; but we shall confine\r\nourselves to translating the words of a modern French traveler who\r\nwas in the Philippines for a long time:\r\n\r\n\"The good curate,\" he says with reference to the rosy picture a friar\r\nhad given him of the Philippines, \"had not told me about the governor,\r\nthe foremost official of the district, who was too much taken up\r\nwith the ideal of getting rich to have time to tyrannize over his\r\ndocile subjects; the governor, charged with ruling the country and\r\ncollecting the various taxes in the government's name, devoted himself\r\nalmost wholly to trade; in his hands the high and noble functions he\r\nperforms are nothing more than instruments of gain. He monopolizes\r\nall the business and instead of developing on his part the love\r\nof work, instead of stimulating the too natural indolence of the\r\nnatives, he with abuse of his powers thinks only of destroying all\r\ncompetition that may trouble him or attempt to participate in his\r\nprofits. It matters little to him that the country is impoverished,\r\nwithout cultivation, without commerce, without, industry, just so\r\nthe governor is quickly enriched!\"\r\n\r\nYet the traveler has been unfair in picking out the governor\r\nespecially: Why only the governor?\r\n\r\nWe do not cite passages from other authors, because we have not their\r\nworks at hand and do not wish to quote from memory.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty that every enterprise encountered with the\r\nadministration contributed not a little to kill off all commercial\r\nand industrial movement. All the Filipinos, as well as all those who\r\nhave tried to engage in business in the Philippines, know how many\r\ndocuments, what comings, how many stamped papers, how much patience is\r\nneeded to secure from the government a permit for an enterprise. One\r\nmust count upon the good will of this one, on the influence of that\r\none, on a good bribe to another in order that the application be not\r\npigeonholed, a present to the one further on so that he may pass it on\r\nto his chief; one must pray to God to give him good humor and time to\r\nsee and examine it; to another, talent to recognize its expediency; to\r\none further on sufficient stupidity not to scent behind the enterprise\r\nan insurrectionary purpose; and that they may not all spend the time\r\ntaking baths, hunting or playing cards with the reverend friars in\r\ntheir convents or country houses. And above all, great patience,\r\ngreat knowledge of how to get along, plenty of money, a great deal of\r\npolitics, many salutations, great influence, plenty of presents and\r\ncomplete resignation! How is it strange that, the Philippines remain\r\npoor in spite of their very fertile soil, when history tells us that\r\nthe countries now the most flourishing date their development from\r\nthe day of their liberty and civil rights? The most commercial and\r\nmost industrious countries have been the freest countries: France,\r\nEngland and the United States prove this. Hongkong, which is not worth\r\nthe most insignificant of the Philippines, has more commercial movement\r\nthan all the islands together, because it is free and is well governed.\r\n\r\nThe trade with China, which was the whole occupation of the colonizers\r\nof the Philippines, was not only prejudicial to Spain but also to\r\nthe life of her colonies; in fact, when the officials and private\r\npersons at Manila found an easy method of getting rich they neglected\r\neverything. They paid no attention either to cultivating the soil\r\nor to fostering industry; and wherefore? China furnished the trade,\r\nand they had only to take advantage of it and pick up the gold that\r\ndropped out on its way from Mexico toward the interior of China,\r\nthe gulf whence it never returned.\r\n\r\nThe pernicious example of the dominators in surrounding themselves\r\nwith servants and despising manual or corporal labor as a thing\r\nunbecoming the nobility and chivalrous pride of the heroes of so many\r\ncenturies; those lordly airs, which the natives have translated into\r\ntila ka castila, and the desire of the dominated to be the equal of the\r\ndominators, if not essentially, at least in their manners: all this had\r\nnaturally to produce aversion to activity and fear or hatred of work.\r\n\r\nMoreover, 'Why work?' asked many natives. The curate says that the rich\r\nman will not go to heaven The rich man on earth is liable to all kinds\r\nof trouble, to be appointed a cabeza de barangay, to be deported if\r\nan uprising occurs, to be forced banker of the military chief of the\r\ntown, who to reward him for favors received seizes his laborers and\r\nhis stock, in order to force him to beg for mercy, and thus easily\r\npays up. Why be rich? So that all the officers of justice may have\r\na lynx eye on your actions, so that at the least slip enemies may be\r\nraised up against you, you may be indicted, a whole complicated and\r\nlabyrinthine story may be concocted against you, for which you can\r\nonly get away, not by the thread of Ariadne but by Danae's shower\r\nof gold, and still give thanks that you are not kept in reserve for\r\nsome needy occasion? The native, whom they pretend to regard as an\r\nimbecile, is not so much so that he does not understand that it is\r\nridiculous to work himself to death to become worse off. A proverb\r\nof his says that the pig is cooked in its own lard, and as among\r\nhis bad qualities he has the good one of applying to himself all the\r\ncriticisms and censures he prefers to live miserable and indolent,\r\nrather than play the part of the wretched beast of burden.\r\n\r\nAdd to this the introduction of gambling. We do not mean to san that\r\nbefore the coming of the Spaniards the natives did not gamble: the\r\npassion for grumbling is innate in adventuresome and excitable races,\r\nand such is the Malay. Pigafetta tells us of cock-fights and of bets\r\nin the Island of Paragua. Cock-fighting must also have existed in\r\nLuzon and in all the islands, for in the terminology of the game\r\nare two Tagalog words: sabong, and tari (cockpit and gaff). But\r\nthere is not the least doubt that the fostering of this game is\r\ndue to the government, as well as the perfecting of it. Although\r\nPigafetta tells us of it, he mentions it only in Paragua, and not\r\nin Cebu nor in any other island of the south, where he stayed long\r\ntime. Morga does not speak of it, in spite of his having spent\r\nseven years in Manila, and yet he does describe the kinds of fowl,\r\nthe jungle hens and cocks. Neither does Morga, speak of gambling,\r\nwhen he talks about vices and other defects, more or less concealed,\r\nmore or less insignificant. Moreover, excepting the two Tagalog words\r\nsabong and tari, the others are of Spanish origin, as soltada (setting\r\nthe cocks to fight, then the fight itself), presto, (apuesta, bet),\r\nlogro (winnings), pago (payment), sentenciador (referee), case (to\r\ncover the bets), etc. We say the same about gambling: the word sugal\r\n(jugar, to gamble), like kumpisal (confesar, to confess to a priest),\r\nindicates that gambling was unknown in the Philippines before the\r\nSpaniards. The word laró (Tagalog, to play) is not the equivalent of\r\nthe word sunni. The word balasa (baraja, playing-card) proves that the\r\nintroduction of playing-cards was not due to the Chinese, who have a\r\nkind of playing-cards also, because in that case they would have taken\r\nthe Chinese name. Is not this enough? The word tayá (taltar, to bet),\r\nparis-paris (Spanish pares, pairs of cards), politana (napolitana,\r\na winning sequence of cards), sapore (to stack the cards), kapote\r\n(to slam), monte, and so on, all prove the foreign origin of this\r\nterrible plant, which only produces vice, and which has found in the\r\ncharacter of the native a fit soil, cultivated by circumstances.\r\n\r\nAlong with gambling, which breeds dislike for steady and difficult toil\r\nby its promise of sudden wealth and its appeal to the emotions, with\r\nthe lotteries, with the prodigality and hospitality of the Filipinos,\r\nwent also, to swell this train of misfortunes, the religious functions,\r\nthe great number of fiestas, the long masses for the women to spend\r\ntheir mornings and the novenaries to spend their afternoons, and\r\nthe night, for the processions and rosaries. Remember that lack of\r\ncapital and absence of means paralyze all movement, and you will see\r\nhow the native has perforce to be indolent for if any money might\r\nremain to him from the trials, imposts and exactions, he would have\r\nto give it to the curate for bulls, scapularies, candles, novenaries,\r\netc. And if this does not suffice to form an indolent character,\r\nif the climate and nature are not enough in themselves to daze him\r\nand deprive him of all energy, recall then that the doctrines of his\r\nreligion teach him to irrigate his fields in the dry season, not by\r\nmeans of canals but with masses and prayers; to preserve his stock\r\nduring an epizootic with holy water, exorcisms and benedictions that\r\ncost five dollars an animal; to drive away the locusts by a procession\r\nwith the image of St. Augustine, etc. It is well, undoubtedly, to\r\ntrust greatly in God; but it is better to do what one can and not\r\ntrouble the Creator every moment, even when these appeals redound\r\nto the benefit of His ministers. We have noticed that the countries\r\nwhich believe most in miracles are the laziest, just, as spoiled\r\nchildren are the most ill-mannered. Whether they believe in miracles\r\nto palliate their laziness or they are lazy because they believe in\r\nmiracles, we cannot say; but the fact is the Filipinos were much less\r\nlazy before the word miracle was introduced into their language.\r\n\r\nThe facility with which individual liberty is curtailed, that continual\r\nalarm of all from the knowledge that they are liable to secret report,\r\na governmental ukase, and to the accusation of rebel or suspect,\r\nan accusation which, to be effective, does not need proof or the\r\nproduction of the accuser. With that lack of confidence in the future,\r\nthat uncertainty of reaping the reward of labor, as in a city stricken\r\nwith the plague, everybody yields to fate, shuts himself in his house\r\nor goes about amusing himself in the attempt to spend the few days\r\nthat remain to him in the least disagreeable way possible.\r\n\r\nThe apathy of the government itself toward everything in commerce\r\nand agriculture contributes not a little to foster indolence. There\r\nis no encouragement, at all for the manufacturer or for the farmer;\r\nthe government furnishes no aid either when poor crop comes, when\r\nthe locusts (23) sweep over the fields, or when a cyclone destroys\r\nin its passage the wealth of the soil; nor does it take any trouble\r\nto seek a market for the products of its colonies. Why should it do\r\nso when these same products are burdened with taxes and imposts and\r\nhave not free entry into the ports, of the mother country, nor is\r\ntheir consumption there encouraged? While we see all the walls of\r\nLondon covered with advertisements of the products of its colonies,\r\nwhile the English make heroic efforts to substitute Ceylon for Chinese\r\ntea, beginning with the sacrifice of their taste and their stomach,\r\nin Spain, with the exception of tobacco, nothing from the Philippines\r\nis known: neither its sugar, coffee, hemp, fine cloths, nor its Ilocano\r\nblankets. The name of Manila is known only from those cloths of China\r\nor Indo-China which at one time reached Spain by way of Manila, heavy\r\nsilk shawls, fantastically but coarsely embroidered, which no one has\r\nthought of imitating in Manila, since they are so easily made; but the\r\ngovernment has other cares, and the Filipinos do not know that such\r\nobjects are more highly esteemed in the Peninsula than their delicate\r\npiña, embroideries and their very fine jusi fabrics. Thus disappeared\r\nour trade in indigo, thanks to the trickery of the Chinese, which\r\nthe government could not guard against, occupied as it was with other\r\nthoughts; thus die now the other industries; the fine manufactures of\r\nthe Visayas are gradually disappearing from trade and even from use;\r\nthe people, continually getting poorer, cannot afford the costly cloths\r\nand have to be content with calico or the imitations of the Germans,\r\nwho produce imitations even of the work of our silversmiths.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the best plantations, the best tracts of land in some\r\nprovinces, those that from their easy access are more profitable\r\nthan others, are in the hands of the religious corporations, whose\r\ndesideratum is ignorance and a condition of semi-starvation for the\r\nnative, so that they may continue to govern him and make themselves\r\nnecessary to his wretched existence, is one of the reasons why many\r\ntowns do not progress in spite of the efforts of their inhabitants. We\r\nwill be met with the objections, as an argument on the other side,\r\nthat the towns which belong to the friars are comparatively richer\r\nthan those which do not belong to them. They surely are! Just as their\r\nbrethren in Europe, in founding their convents, knew how to select\r\nthe best valleys, the best uplands for the cultivation of the vine or\r\nthe production of beer, so also the Philippine monks (25) have known\r\nhow to select the best towns, the beautiful plains, the well-watered\r\nfields, to make of them rich plantations. For some time the friars\r\nhave deceived many by making them believe that if these plantations\r\nwere prospering, it was because they were under their care, and the\r\nindolence of the native was thus emphasized; but they forget that in\r\nsame provinces where they have not been able for some reason to get\r\npossession of the best tracts of land, their plantations, like Baurand\r\nand Liang, are inferior to Taal, Balayan and Lipa, regions cultivated\r\nentirely by the natives without any monkish interference whatsoever.\r\n\r\nAdd to this lack of material inducement the absentee of moral stimulus,\r\nand you will see how he who is not indolent in that country must\r\nneeds be a madman or at least a fool. What future awaits him who\r\ndistinguishes himself, him who studies, who rises above the crowd? At\r\nthe cost of study and sacrifice a young man becomes a great chemist,\r\nand after a long course of training, wherein neither the government\r\nnor anybody has given him the least help, he concludes his long\r\nstay in the University. A competitive examination is held to fill\r\na certain position. The young man wins this through knowledge and\r\nperseverance, and after he has won it, it is abolished, because\r\n......... we do not care to give the reason, but when a municipal\r\nlaboratory is closed in order to abolish the position of director,\r\nwho got his place by competitive examination, while other officers,\r\nsuch as the press censor, are preserved, it is because the belief\r\nexists that the light of progress may injure the people more than all\r\nthe adulterated foods (26). In the same way, another young man won a\r\nprize in a literary competition, and as long as his origin was unknown\r\nhis work was discussed, the newspapers praised it and it was regarded\r\nas a masterpiece, but the sealed envelopes were opened, the winner\r\nproved to be a native, while among the losers there were Peninsulars;\r\nthen all the newspapers hastened to extol the losers! Not one word\r\nfrom the government, nor from anybody, to encourage the native who\r\nwith so much affection was cultivating the language and letters of\r\nthe mother country! (27)\r\n\r\nFinally, passing over many other more or less insignificant reasons,\r\nthe enumeration of which would be interminable, let us close this\r\ndreary list with the principal and most terrible of all: the education\r\nof the native.\r\n\r\nFrom his birth until he sinks into his grave, the training of the\r\nnative is brutalizing, depressive and antihuman (the word 'inhuman'\r\nis not sufficiently explanatory: whether or not the Academy admit it,\r\nlet it go). There is no doubt that the government, some priests like\r\nthe Jesuits and some Dominicans like Padre Benavides, have done a\r\ngreat deal by founding colleges, schools of primary instruction, and\r\nthe like. But this is not enough; their effect is neutralized. They\r\namount to five or ten years (years of a hundred and fifty days at most)\r\nduring which the youth comes in contact with books selected by those\r\nvery priests who boldly proclaim that it is an evil for the natives\r\nto know Castilian, that the native should not be separated from his\r\ncarabao, that he should not have any further aspirations, and so on;\r\nfive to ten years during which the majority of the students have\r\ngrasped nothing more than that no one understands what the books\r\nsay, not even the professors themselves perhaps; and these five to\r\nten years have to offset the daily preachment of the whole life,\r\nthat preachment which lowers the dignity of man, which by degrees\r\nbrutally deprives him of the sentiment of self-esteem, that eternal,\r\nstubborn, constant labor to bow the native's neck, to make him accept\r\nthe yoke, to place him on a level with the beast--a labor aided by\r\nsome persons, with or without the ability to write, which if it does\r\nnot produce in some individuals the desired effect, in others it has\r\nthe opposite effect, like the breaking of a cord that is stretched\r\ntoo tightly. Thus, while they attempt to make of the native a kind of\r\nanimal, vet in exchange they demand of him divine actions. And we say\r\ndivine actions, because he must be a god who does not become indolent\r\nin that climate, surrounded by the circumstances mentioned. Deprive a\r\nman, then, of his dignity, and you not only deprive him of his moral\r\nstrength but you also make him useless even for those who wish to\r\nmake use of him. Every creature has its stimulus, its mainspring:\r\nman's is his self-esteem. Take it away from him and he is a corpse,\r\nand he who seeks activity in a corpse will encounter only worms.\r\n\r\nThus is explained how the natives of the present time are no longer\r\nthe same as those of the time of the discovery, neither morally\r\nnor physically.\r\n\r\nThe ancient writers, like Chirino, Morga and Colin, take pleasure\r\nin describing them as well-featured, with good aptitudes for any\r\nthing they take up, keen and susceptible and of resolute will,\r\nvery clean and neat in their persons and clothing, and of good\r\nmien and bearing. (Morga). Others delight in minute accounts of\r\ntheir intelligence and pleasant manners, of their aptitude for\r\nmusic, the drama, dancing and singing; of the facility with which\r\nthey learned, not only Spanish but also Latin, which they acquired\r\nalmost by themselves (Colin); others, of their exquisite politeness\r\nin their dealings and in their social life; others, like the first\r\nAugustinians, whose accounts Gaspar de San Augustin copies, found\r\nthem more gallant and better mannered than the inhabitants of the\r\nMoluccas. \"All live off their husbandry,\" adds Morga, \"their farms,\r\nfisheries and enterprises, for they travel from island to island by\r\nsea and from province to province by land.\"\r\n\r\nIn exchange, the writers of the present time, without being better than\r\nthose of former times, neither as men nor as historians, without being\r\nmore gallant than Hernan Cortez and Salcedo, nor more prudent than\r\nLegazpi, nor more manly than Morga, nor more studious than Colin and\r\nGaspar de San Agustin, our contemporary writers, we say, find that the\r\nnative is a creature something more than a monkey but much less than\r\na man, an anthropoid, dull-witted, stupid, timid, dirty, cringing,\r\ngrinning, ill-clothed, indolent, lazy, brainless, immoral, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nTo what is this retrogression due? Is it the delectable civilization,\r\nthe religion of salvation of the friars, called of Jesus Christ by\r\na euphemism, that has produced this miracle, that has atrophied his\r\nbrain, paralyzed his heart and made of the man this sort of vicious\r\nanimal that the writers depict?\r\n\r\nAlas! The whole misfortune of the present Filipinos consists in that\r\nthey have become only half-way brutes. The Filipino is convinced that\r\nto get happiness it is necessary for him to lay aside his dignity\r\nas a rational creature, to attend mass, to believe what is told him,\r\nto pay what is demanded of him, to pay and forever to pay; to work,\r\nsuffer and be silent, without aspiring to anything, without aspiring to\r\nknow or even to understand Spanish, without separating himself from his\r\ncarabao, as the priests shamelessly say, without protesting against\r\nany injustice, against any arbitrary action, against an assault,\r\nagainst an insult; that is, not to have heart, brain or spirit:\r\na creature with arms and a purse full of gold ............ there's\r\nthe ideal native! Unfortunately, or because the brutalization is not\r\nyet complete and because the nature of man is inherent in his being in\r\nspite of his condition, the native protests; he still has aspirations,\r\nhe thinks and strives to rise, and there's the trouble!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter we set forth the causes that proceed\r\nfrom the government in fostering and maintaining the evil we are\r\ndiscussing. Now it falls to us to analyze those that emanate from\r\nthe people. Peoples and governments are correlated and complementary:\r\na fatuous government would be an anomaly among righteous people, just\r\nas a corrupt people cannot exist under just rulers and wise laws. Like\r\npeople, like government, we will say in paraphrase of a popular adage.\r\n\r\nWe can reduce all these causes to two classes: to defects of training\r\nand lack of national sentiment.\r\n\r\nOf the influence of climate we spoke at the beginning, so we will\r\nnot treat of the effects arising from it.\r\n\r\nThe very limited training in the home, the tyrannical and sterile\r\neducation of the rare centers of learning, that blind subordination of\r\nthe youth to one of greater age, influence the mind so that a man may\r\nnot aspire to excel those who preceded him but must merely be content\r\nto go along with or march behind them. Stagnation forcibly results\r\nfrom this, and as he who devotes himself merely to copying divests\r\nhimself of other qualities suited to his own nature, he naturally\r\nbecomes sterile; hence decadence. Indolence is a corollary derived\r\nfrom the lack of stimulus and of vitality.\r\n\r\nThat modesty infused into the convictions of every one, or, to\r\nspeak more clearly, that insinuated inferiority, a sort of daily and\r\nconstant depreciation of the mind so that, it may not be raised to\r\nthe regions of light, deadens the energies, paralyzes all tendency\r\ntoward advancement, and at the least struggle a man gives up without\r\nfighting. If by one of those rare accidents, some wild spirit, that\r\nis, some active one, excels, instead of his example stimulating, it\r\nonly causes others to persist in their inaction. 'There's one who will\r\nwork for us: let's sleep on!' say his relatives and friends. True it\r\nis that the spirit of rivalry is sometimes awakened, only that then\r\nit awakens with bad humor in the guise of envy, and instead of being\r\na lever for helping, it is an obstacle that produces discouragement.\r\n\r\nNurtured by the example of anchorites of a contemplative and lazy\r\nlife, the natives spend theirs in giving their gold to the Church\r\nin the hope of miracles and other wonderful things. Their will is\r\nhypnotized: from childhood they learn to act mechanically, without\r\nknowledge of the object, thanks to the exercises imposed upon them\r\nfrom the tenderest years of praying for whole hours in an unknown\r\ntongue, of venerating things that they do not understand, of accepting\r\nbeliefs that are not explained to them to having absurdities imposed\r\nupon them, while the protests of reason are repressed. Is it any\r\nwonder that with this vicious dressage of intelligence and will the\r\nnative, of old logical and consistent--as the analysis of his\r\npast and of his language demonstrates--should now be a mass of\r\ndismal contradictions? That continual struggle between reason and\r\nduty, between his organism and his new ideals, that civil war which\r\ndisturbs the peace of his conscience all his life, has the result, of\r\nparalyzing all his energies, and aided by the severity of the climate,\r\nmakes of that eternal vacillation, of the doubts in his brain, the\r\norigin of his indolent disposition.\r\n\r\n\"You can't know more than this or that old man!\" \"Don't aspire to\r\nbe greater than the curate!\" \"You belong to an inferior race!\" \"You\r\nhaven't any energy!\" This is what they tell the child, and as they\r\nrepeat it so often, it has perforce to become engraved on his mind\r\nand thence mould and pervade all his actions. The child or youth\r\nwho tries to be anything else is blamed with vanity and presumption;\r\nthe curate ridicules him with cruel sarcasm, his relatives look upon\r\nhim with fear, strangers regard him with great compassion. No forward\r\nmovement! Get back in the ranks and keep in line!\r\n\r\nWith his spirit thus moulded the native falls into the most pernicious\r\nof all routines: routine not planned, but imposed and forced. Note\r\nthat the native himself is not, naturally inclined to routine, but\r\nhis mind is disposed to accept all truths, just as his house is open\r\nto all strangers. The good and the beautiful attract him, seduce and\r\ncaptivate him, although, like the Japanese, he often exchanges the good\r\nfor the evil, if it appears to him garnished and gilded. What he lacks\r\nis in the first place liberty to allow expansion to his adventuresome\r\nspirit, and good examples, beautiful prospects for the future. It is\r\nnecessary that his spirit, although it may be dismayed and cowed by\r\nthe elements and the fearful manifestation of their mighty forces,\r\nstore up energy, seek high purposes, in order to struggle against\r\nobstacles in the midst of unfavorable natural conditions. In order\r\nthat he may progress it is necessary that a revolutionary spirit,\r\nso to speak, should boil in his veins, since progress necessarily\r\nrequires change; it implies the overthrow of the past, there deified,\r\nby the present; the victory of new ideas over the ancient and accepted\r\nones. It will not be sufficient to speak to his fancy, to talk nicely\r\nto him, nor that the light illuminate him like the ignis fatuus that\r\nleads travelers astray at night; all the flattering promises of the\r\nfairest hopes will not suffice, so long as his spirit is not free,\r\nhis intelligence not respected.\r\n\r\nThe reasons that originate in the lack of national sentiment are\r\nstill more lamentable and more transcendental.\r\n\r\nConvinced by the insinuation of his inferiority, his spirit harassed\r\nby his education, if that brutalization of which we spoke above can\r\nbe called education, in that exchange of usages and sentiments among\r\ndifferent nations, the Filipino, to whom remain only his susceptibility\r\nand his poetical imagination, allows himself to be guided by his fancy\r\nand his self-love. It is sufficient that the foreigner praise to him\r\nthe imported merchandise and run down the native product for him to\r\nhasten to make the change, without reflecting that everything has its\r\nweak side and the most sensible custom is ridiculous in the eyes\r\nof those who do not follow it. They have dazzled him with tinsel,\r\nwith strings, of colored glass beads, with noisy rattles, shining\r\nmirrors and other trinkets, and he has given in return his gold,\r\nhis conscience, and even his liberty. He changed his religion for the\r\nexternal practices of another cult; the convictions and usages derived\r\nfrom his climate and needs, for other usages and other convictions\r\nthat developed under another sky and another inspiration. His spirit,\r\nwell-disposed toward everything that looks good to him, was then\r\ntransformed, at the pleasure of the nation that forced upon him\r\nits God and its laws, and as the trader with whom he dealt did not\r\nbring a cargo of useful implements of iron, hoes to till the fields,\r\nbut stamped papers, crucifixes, bulls and prayer-books; as he did\r\nnot have for ideal and prototype the tanned and vigorous laborer,\r\nbut the aristocratic lord, carried in a luxurious litter, the result\r\nwas that the imitative people became bookish, devout, prayerful; it\r\nacquired ideas of luxury and ostentation, without thereby improving\r\nthe means of its subsistence to a corresponding degree.\r\n\r\nThe lack of national sentiment brings another evil, moreover, which is\r\nthe absence of all opposition to measures prejudicial to the people and\r\nthe absence of any initiative in whatever may redound to its good. A\r\nman in the Philippines is only an individual, he is not a member\r\nof a nation. He is forbidden and denied the right of association,\r\nand is therefore weak and sluggish. The Philippines are an organism\r\nwhose cells seem to have no arterial system to irrigate it or nervous\r\nsystem to communicate its impressions; these cells must, nevertheless,\r\nyield their product, get it where they can: if they perish, let them\r\nperish. In the view of some this is expedient so that a colony may\r\nbe a colony; perhaps they are right, but not to the effect that a\r\ncolony may flourish.\r\n\r\nThe result of this is that if a prejudicial measure is ordered,\r\nno one protests; all goes well apparently until later the evils are\r\nfelt. Another blood-letting, and as the organism has neither nerves\r\nnor voice the physician proceeds in the belief that the treatment\r\nis not injuring it. It needs a reform, but as it must not speak, it\r\nkeeps silent and remains with the need. The patient wants to eat,\r\nit wants to breathe the fresh air, but as such desires may offend\r\nthe susceptibility of the physician who thinks that he has already\r\nprovided everything necessary, it suffers and pines away from fear of\r\nreceiving scolding, of getting another plaster and a new blood-letting,\r\nand so on indefinitely.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, love of peace and the horror many have of\r\naccepting the few administrative positions which fall to the Filipinos\r\non account of the trouble and annoyance these cause them places at the\r\nhead of the people the most stupid and incapable men, those who submit\r\nto everything, those who can endure all the caprices and exactions of\r\nthe curate and of the officials. With this inefficiency in the lower\r\nspheres of power and ignorance and indifference in the upper, with the\r\nfrequent changes and the eternal apprenticeships, with great fear and\r\nmany administrative obstacles, with a voiceless people that has neither\r\ninitiative nor cohesion, with employees who nearly all strive to\r\namass a fortune and return home, with inhabit, ants who live in great\r\nhardship from the instant they begin to breathe, create prosperity,\r\nagriculture and industry, found enterprises and companies, things\r\nthat still hardly prosper in free and well-organized communities.\r\n\r\nYes, all attempt is useless that does not spring from a profound\r\nstudy of the evil that afflicts us. To combat this indolence,\r\nsome have proposed increasing the native's needs and raising the\r\ntaxes. What has happened? Criminals have multiplied, penury has been\r\naggravated. Why? Because the native already has enough needs with his\r\nfunctions of the Church, with his fiestas, with the public offices\r\nforced on him, the donations and bribes that he has to make so that\r\nhe may drag out his wretched existence. The cord is already too taut.\r\n\r\nWe have heard many complaints, and every day we read in the papers\r\nabout the efforts the government is making to rescue the country\r\nfrom its condition of indolence. Weighing its plans, its illusions\r\nand its difficulties, we are reminded of the gardener who tried to\r\nraise a tree planted in a small flower-pot. The gardener spent his\r\ndays tending and watering the handful of earth, he trimmed the plant\r\nfrequently, he pulled at it to lengthen it and hasten its growth,\r\nhe grafted on it cedars and oaks, until one day the little tree died,\r\nleaving the man convinced that it belonged to a degenerate species,\r\nattributing the failure of his experiment to everything except the\r\nlack of soil and his own ineffable folly.\r\n\r\nWithout education and liberty, that soil and that sun of mankind,\r\nno reform is possible, no measure can give the result desired. This\r\ndoes not mean that we should ask first for the native the instruction\r\nof a sage and all imaginable liberties, in order then to put a hoe\r\nin his hand or place him in a workshop; such a pretension would be\r\nan absurdity and vain folly. What we wish is that obstacles be not\r\nput in his way, that the many his climate and the situation of the\r\nislands afford be not augmented, that instruction be not begrudged\r\nhim for fear that when he becomes intelligent he may separate from\r\nthe colonizing nation or ask for the rights of which he makes himself\r\nworthy. Since some day or other he will become enlightened, whether\r\nthe government wishes it or not, let his enlightenment be as a gift\r\nreceived and not as conquered plunder. We desire that the policy be\r\nat once frank and consistent, that is, highly civilizing, without\r\nsordid reservations, without distrust, without fear or jealousy,\r\nwishing the good for the sake of the good, civilization for the sake of\r\ncivilization, without ulterior thoughts of gratitude, or else boldly\r\nexploiting, tyrannical and selfish without hypocrisy or deception,\r\nwith a whole system well-planned and studied out for dominating by\r\ncompelling obedience, for commanding to get rich, for getting rich\r\nto be happy. If the former, the government may act with the security\r\nthat some day or other it will reap the harvest and will find a\r\npeople its own in heart and interest; there is nothing like a favor\r\nfor securing the friendship or enmity of man, according to whether\r\nit be conferred with good will or hurled into his face and bestowed\r\nupon him in spite of himself. If the logical and regulated system of\r\nexploitation be chosen, stifling with the jingle of gold and the sheen\r\nof opulence the sentiments of independence in the colonies, paying\r\nwith its wealth for its lack of liberty, as the English do in India,\r\nwho moreover leave the government to native rulers, then build roads,\r\nlay out highways, foster the freedom of trade; let the government heed\r\nmaterial interests more than the interests of four orders of friars;\r\nlet it send out intelligent employees to foster industry; just judges,\r\nall well paid, so that they be not venal pilferers, and lay aside all\r\nreligious pretext. This policy has the advantage in that while it may\r\nnot lull the instincts of liberty wholly to sleep, yet the day when\r\nthe mother country loses her colonies she will at least have the gold\r\namassed and not the regret of having reared ungrateful children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Sancianco y Goson, Gregorio: El progreso de Filipinas. Estudios\r\neconómicos, administrativos y políticos. Parte económica. Madrid,\r\nImp. de la Vda. de J M. Perez, 1881 Pp XIV-260.\r\n\r\nAn eminent student of Philippine life and history, James A. LeRoy in\r\nhis \"The Philippines, 1860-1898--Some comment and bibliographical\r\nnotes\" published in volume 52 of Blair and Robertson, Philippine\r\nIslands 1493-1898, praises this book (p. 141) as \"especially\r\nvaluable on administrative matters just prior to the revision of\r\nthe fiscal regime in connection with the abolition of the government\r\ntobacco monopoly\", and for its \"data on land, commerce, and industry\"\r\n\r\n2. Before 1590, one of the Spanish officers in the Philippines,\r\ncommenting on the climate of the Islands, declared, with considerable\r\nacumen, that Europeans could stand life and work here if they observed\r\ncontinence in regard to the use of alcoholic beverages.\r\n\r\n3. See Morga's \"Report of conditions in the Philippines (June 8,\r\n1598)\" in Blair and Robertson vol. 10. pp. 75-80, in which various\r\nabuses of the friars are set forth. This should be compared with the\r\nfollowing pages of the same relation (pp. 89-90) on secular affairs,\r\nfrom which it will be recognized that the condition was not so much\r\nthe resultant of one class as of Spanish national character. Cf. also,\r\nAnda y Salazar B. and R, vol. 50, pp. 137-190; and Le Gentil, Voyage\r\n(Paris, 1779-81), vol. 1, pp. 183-191. It would be hardly fair\r\nnot to call to mind that the Filipinos are debtors to the friars in\r\nmany ways, and the Filipinos themselves should be the last to forget\r\nthis. For a good exposition from the friar point of view, see Zamora,\r\nLas Corporaciones-Religiosas en Filipinas: Valladolid, 1901.\r\n\r\nSee also Mallat, Les Philippines (Paris, 1846), vol. 1, pp. 374-389.\r\n\r\n4. The history of the Philippines is full of references to Chinese\r\nwho came here for the reasons assigned by Rizal. The antiquarian\r\nwill be interested in consulting a small work entitled Notes on\r\nthe Malay Archipelago and Malacca, compiled from Chinese sources,\r\nby W. P. Groeneveldt.\r\n\r\n5 See B. and R., vol 34, pp. 183-191 for a description of the\r\nearly Chinese trade in the Philippines, also translated by Hirth from\r\nChinese sources, but evidently not the same as referred to by Rizal,\r\n\r\n6. This citation is translated directly from the original Italian\r\nMs. Rizal's account is seen to be slightly different and arises from\r\nthe fact that he made use of Amoretti's printed version of the Ms.,\r\nwhich is wrong in many particulars. Amoretti attempted to change\r\nthe original Ms. into modern Italian, with disastrous result. It is\r\nto be regretted that Walls y Merino followed the same garbled text,\r\nin his Primer viaje alrededor del Mundo (Madrid, 1899).\r\n\r\nDr. Antonio de Morga's book is perhaps the most famous of all the\r\nearly books treating of the Philippines. Its full title is as follows:\r\n\"Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas: Dirigido á Don Cristoval Gomez de\r\nSandoval y Rojas, Duque de Cea, Mexico, En casa de Geronymo Balli,\r\n1609.\" The original edition is very rare, and is worth almost its\r\nweight in gold. The manuscript circulated for some years before the\r\ndate of publication.\r\n\r\nThe second Spanish edition of the work was published by Rizal himself,\r\nwho was always a sincere admirer of the book. It bears the following\r\ntitle-page: \"Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas por el Doctor Antonio de\r\nMorga. Obra publicada en Mejico el año de 1609 nuevamente sacada á luz\r\ny anotada por José Rizal y precedida de un prólogo del Prof. Fernando\r\nBlumentritt. Paris, Libreria de Garnier Hermanos, 1890.\" Shortly\r\nbefore Rizal began work on his edition, a Spanish scholar, Justo\r\nZaragoza, began the publication of a new edition of Morga. The book\r\nwas reprinted, but the notes, prologue, and life of Morga which\r\nZargoza had intended to insert, were never completed because of that\r\neditor's death. Only two copies of this edition, so far as known, were\r\never bound, one of which belongs to the Ayer collection in Chicago,\r\nand the other by the Tabacalera purchase to the Philippine Library,\r\nin Manila. Still one other Spanish edition has appeared, namely:\r\n\"Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas por el Dr. Antonio de Morga. Nueva\r\nedición enriquecida con los escritos inéditos del mismo autor ilustrada\r\ncon numerosas notas que amplian el texto y prologada extensamente por\r\nW. E. Retana, Madrid, Libreria General de Victoriano Suarez, Editor,\r\n1909.\" Retana adds a life of Morga and numerous documents written by\r\nhim. An English edition was published as follows: \"The Philippine\r\nIslands, Moluccas, Siam, Cambodia, Japan, and China. at the close\r\nof the sixteenth century. By Antonio de Morga. Translated from the\r\nSpanish, with notes and a preface, and a letter from Luis Vaez de\r\nTorres, describing his voyage through the Torres Straits, by the\r\nHen. Henry E. J. Stanley, London, Printed for the Hakluyt Society,\r\n1868\". However, Stanley's translation is poor, and parts of passages\r\nare not translated at all. [It was this edition then in preparation by\r\nthe Hakluyt Society, which Sir John Bowring, a director of the society,\r\nmentioned on his visit to Rizal's uncle in Biñan, so that to make the\r\nbook available to Spaniards and Filipinos became an ambition from\r\nchildhood with Rizal.-C.] A second English translation appears in\r\nB. and R. vols. 15 and 16. A separate copy of this translation was\r\nalso published in a very limited edition, with the title: \"History\r\nof the Philippine Islands from their discovery by Magellan in 1521 to\r\nthe beginning of the XVII century; with descriptions of Japan, China\r\nand adjacent countries, by Dr. Antonio de Morga, alcalde of criminal\r\ncauses, in the Royal Audiencia of Nueva España, and counsel for the\r\nHoly Office of the inquisition. Completely translated into English,\r\nedited and annotated by E. H. Blair and J. A. Robertson. Cleveland,\r\nOhio, The Arthur H. Clark Company, 1907.\" See B. and R. vols. 9-12\r\nfor other documents by Morga, and vol. 53 (or Robertson's Bibliography\r\nof the Philippine Islands, Cleveland, 1908), for bibliographical\r\ndetails regarding Morga and titles to documents. Perhaps the most\r\nfamous of all his writings outside of his book is his relation\r\nmentioned ante, note 3.\r\n\r\n7. Published at London in 1783. See p. 346.\r\n\r\n8. See B. and R., vol. 4, pp. 221, 222, for an old boatsong.\r\n\r\n9. Colin's Labor evangelica, published in Madrid, 1663; a new edition,\r\nin three volumes, and greatly enriched by notes and was published by\r\nPablo Pastells, S. J. (Barcelona, 1900-1902).\r\n\r\n10. See B. and R., vol. 33, pp. 233-235. The original says the\r\nransom included 150 chickens; hence 450, an error due again to\r\nAmoretti.\r\n\r\n11, Conquistas do las Islas Fillpinas (Madrid, 1698). There is no\r\ndoubt of the frequency of inter-island trade among the peoples of the\r\nPhilippines at an early period. Trade was stimulated by the very fact\r\nthat the Malay peoples, except those who have been driven into the\r\nmountainous interiors, are by their very nature a seafaring people. The\r\nfact of an inter-island traffic is indicative of a culture above that\r\npossessed by a people in the barbarian stage of culture. Of course,\r\nthere was considerable Chinese trade as well throughout the islands.\r\n\r\n12. This estimate is somewhat high. A writer in speaking of the\r\npopulation of Manila, the metropolis of the Philippines then as now,\r\nabout 1570 says that its population scarcely reached 80,000, instead\r\nof the 200,000 reported.\r\n\r\n13 Licentiate Pedro de Rojas, of the Manila Audiencia, in a letter\r\nto Felipe II, June 30, 1586--Vol.6, pp. 265-274 says (p. 270):\r\n\"If there were no trade with China, the citizens of these islands,\r\nwould be richer; for the natives if they had not so many tostons,\r\nwould pay their tributes in the articles which they produce, and\r\nwhich are current, that is, cloths, lampotes, cotton, and gold.--all\r\nof which have great value in Nueva España. These they cease to\r\nproduce because of the abundance of silver; and what is worse and\r\nentails more loss upon your Majesty, is that they do not, as formerly,\r\nwork the mines and take out gold\". The old records contains numerous\r\nreferences to the decline of the native industries of the Philippines\r\nafter the arrival of the Spaniards and the increase of Chinese trade.\r\n\r\n14. See ante, note 13.\r\n\r\n15. The decrease of population among native people in the Philippines\r\nafter the arrival of the Spaniards compares in no degree with what\r\noccurred in America. A most distressing picture of conditions in the\r\nPhilippines is given by Bishop Domingo de Salazar in his relation\r\nwritten about 1583 (see B. & R., vol 5, pp. 210-255. See especially\r\np. 212.) It is well to balance Salazar's account with those of others\r\n\r\n(A \"tributary\" was generally reckoned as five persons, one \"tribute\"\r\nbeing required for each adult male. Hence \"tributaries\" and \"families\"\r\nmay here be taken to mean about the same number,--D.)\r\n\r\n16. The forced labor required by the Spaniards in shipbuilding formed\r\none of the legitimate causes of complaint among the people almost\r\nfrom the beginning.\r\n\r\n17. See ante, note 15, also note 16.\r\n\r\n18. The early friars, although many of them fell into some of the very\r\nfaults which they condemned, inveighed boldly against the cruelty of\r\nthe Spaniards. Doubtless their attitude did encourage their converts\r\nto withdraw from industry to a certain degree.\r\n\r\n19. See B. & R, vol. 4, pp. 148-303.\r\n\r\n20 See B & R., vol. 6, for early accounts of Chinese trade and Spanish\r\nmeasures affecting it The hostility between Spaniards and Portuguese\r\nenters largely into the question. The effects of the deplorably\r\nbad economics of Spain in its trade relations are still felt in\r\nthe Peninsula.\r\n\r\n21. See ante, note 20.\r\n\r\n22. See ante, note 20. The arrival and departure of the annual galleon\r\nwere times of activity, but otherwise Manila was a dull town, with\r\nlittle industry. The Chinese usurped all the petty trade.\r\n\r\n23 It is to the credit, of the Sociedad Económica de Amigos del Pais de\r\nFilipinas, founded by the energetic governor Basco y Vargas in 1781,\r\nthat it extended its many-sided interests to the destruction of the\r\ndevastating hordes of locusts that visit the Philippines so frequently.\r\n\r\n24 The Spanish policy remained to the end one of exclusion, and\r\nthe privileges granted were almost all because of coercion, and the\r\npenetrating force of modern ideas.\r\n\r\n25. A loose use of the word \"monk\", which is properly used of a\r\ncloistered ecclesiastic who does not leave his convent. \"Friar\" would\r\nbe a more exact term. The Benedictines are monks; the Augustinians,\r\nDominicans, Franciscans, and Recollects, are friars.\r\n\r\n26. This was the Filipino chemist Anacleto del Rosario, whom Rizal\r\nrightly praises.\r\n\r\n27. This refers doubtless to Rizal himself, who competed in an open\r\ncontest for Spaniards and Indians, of the Liceo Artistico-Literario\r\nde Manila, and of whom such an occurrence is related. He was awarded\r\nfirst prose prize for a production entitled \"El Consejo de los Dioses\",\r\nwhich see in the \"Revista del Liceo Artistico-Literario de Manila,\r\nNo. 4, 1880, pd. 45. This production, which bears neither signature\r\nnor sign of authorship, is dated April 13, 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Indolence of the Filipino, by Jose Rizal",
