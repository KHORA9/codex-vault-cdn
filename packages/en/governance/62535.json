He pictures the great historical events as though they were\r\n  happening before your eyes; he carries you with him to see the battles\r\n  of old; to meet kings and queens and warriors; to sit in the Roman\r\n  Senate; to march against Saladin and his dark-skinned followers; to\r\n  sail the southern seas with Drake; to circumnavigate the globe with\r\n  Magellan; to watch that this line of Greek spearmen work havoc with\r\n  the Persian hordes on the field of Marathon; to know Napoleon as you\r\n  know Roosevelt. He combines absorbing interest with supreme\r\n  reliability, and makes the heroes of history real living men and\r\n  women, and about them he weaves the rise and fall of empires in such a\r\n  fascinating style that history becomes as absorbingly interesting as\r\n  the greatest of fiction.\r\n\r\n  =Ridpath’s= History is strongly endorsed by Presidents Harrison,\r\n  Cleveland, and McKinley, Jefferson Davis, Lew Wallace, John L.\r\n  Stoddard, Bishop Vincent, Dr. Cuyler, Rabbi Hirsch, Presidents of Ann\r\n  Harbor, Amherst, Brown, Dartmouth, Tufts, Trinity, Bates, Colby,\r\n  Smith, Vassar, Yale, and other Colleges, and by the Great American\r\n  People, 200,000 of whom own and love it.\r\n\r\n  =Ridpath= is generally conceded the Greatest History ever written.\r\n\r\n  =$1 Brings the Complete Set.

We\r\n  are careful as to the character of the advertisements which we carry,\r\n  which necessarily restricts our revenue from this source, so in your\r\n  appreciation of this fact we ask you as our friends to so far as\r\n  possible patronize our advertising friends and in doing so, be careful\r\n  to mention this Magazine so they may know our people and know they are\r\n  appreciative.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Since the time of President Jefferson’s Administration, it has\r\n  been sufficient guarantee of the quality of an article to\r\n  know it was bought at GALT’S :  :  :  :  :  :  :  :  :  :  :\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  GALT & BRO.\r\n\r\n  ESTABLISHED OVER A CENTURY\r\n\r\n  Jewellers, Silversmiths, Stationers\r\n\r\n  1107 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, D.

GLENN STOVALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A Request.\r\n\r\n  WATSON’S JEFFERSONIAN MAGAZINE stands for all that is best in the life\r\n  of the people and the future of the republic. It will advocate those\r\n  principles for which its editor has so long fought. It is Mr. Watson’s\r\n  unselfish ambition to establish this Magazine in the minds, hearts and\r\n  thoughts of our people; to make it a power for the right against the\r\n  wrong and to make it a factor in moulding the minds of our young\r\n  manhood and womanhood for the future.\r\n\r\n  _OUR REQUEST._\r\n\r\n  If you believe in the principles which this Magazine represents. If\r\n  you would see it succeed, First, read it, every department. Then talk\r\n  WATSON’S JEFFERSONIAN MAGAZINE enthusiastically with every one with\r\n  whom you come in contact, make up your mind to send at least five (5)\r\n  yearly subscriptions before our next issue is out, and send them. You\r\n  will find this an easy task if you will make it a point to call on\r\n  those whom you know to believe in justice and freedom.\r\n\r\n  It is impossible to portray in words our appreciation to the many\r\n  hundreds who have more than granted this request already. We can only\r\n  predict greater results from them in the near future, which bespeaks\r\n  our absolute confidence in their unselfish devotion to a cause which\r\n  has had more than one martyr.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The National Sanitary Felt Mattress\r\n\r\n  Is Superior to the Best Hair Mattress.

Mann formed a new company, seized the Magazine under legal\r\n  forms, and are now running it for themselves.\r\n\r\n  =Col. Mann of Town Topics is Editor-in-Chief.=\r\n\r\n  C. Q.

Mann’s name is not even mentioned in this circular.=\r\n\r\n  Almost every statement made about me in that circular is a base,\r\n  malicious falsehood. They are simply =trying to hide their own guilt\r\n  in a cloud of slanderous fabrications=.\r\n\r\n  In the November number of “Watson’s Magazine” appeared an article with\r\n  the title of “=Explanatory=.” It should have been labelled\r\n  “=Defamatory=.”\r\n\r\n  It reeks with venom and lies. =Col. Mann wrote part of it=, and\r\n  DeFrance wrote the balance.\r\n\r\n  These publications of theirs do me the rankest injustice.\r\n\r\n  =I have no mailing list of the magazine which bears my name, and never\r\n  had one.=\r\n\r\n  =Consequently, I am at present powerless to reach the subscribers and\r\n  readers of “Watson’s Magazine.” I have no way of letting them know the\r\n  real state of the case.=\r\n\r\n  =On account of this very serious disadvantage, I make this appeal to\r\n  you:=\r\n\r\n  =Pray, inform your readers that I am now publishing the genuine\r\n  Watson’s Jeffersonian Magazine in Atlanta, Ga., of which this is the\r\n  first number.=\r\n\r\n  And that in the “Foreword” of this number is given =a full history of\r\n  my connection with the New York Magazine, together with my reasons for\r\n  quitting.=\r\n\r\n  In the interest of =Fair Play=, I beg that you do me this favor.\r\n\r\n  It is one which, under similar circumstances =you would not ask of me\r\n  in vain=.\r\n\r\n  THOS.

WATSON,\r\n  Editor and Proprietor.\r\n\r\n  VOL. I.\r\n\r\n  JANUARY, 1907\r\n\r\n  NO. 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForeword.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore me lies a Thing, bearing on its cover the legend,\r\n\r\n“WATSON’S MAGAZINE.”\r\n\r\nThe familiar emblem, the Liberty Bell, is in the center of the space,\r\nand below is the address of\r\n\r\n  “Watson’s Magazine Company,”\r\n      121 West 42nd Street, New York.\r\n\r\nOpening this Thing and scanning the Table of Contents, I note the\r\nabsence of the name of Mr. Watson, former Editor-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nHe’s out.\r\n\r\nNor do I see the name of the former Managing Editor, Mr. Duffy.\r\n\r\nHe’s out, also.\r\n\r\nC. Q. DeFrance is still on deck, however, and Ted Flaacke is still\r\nAdvertising Manager--with no advertisements to manage.\r\n\r\nThen comes a statement of the Contents of the November number. First the\r\nold familiar word, “EDITORIALS,” meets my eyes. But the name of the\r\nwriter is not given.\r\n\r\nIt used to be Mr. Watson. WHO IS IT NOW?\r\n\r\nThe Table of Contents does not state.\r\n\r\nThe Editor is a Man of Mystery. Was he ashamed of his Editorials, or\r\nwere the Editorials ashamed of _him_? Deponent sayeth not--because he\r\ndoesn’t know.\r\n\r\nEverybody else’s name is given, save that of the only man whose name\r\nthere was any special reason for giving--to wit, THE EDITOR.\r\n\r\nIs THIS the way they send you into the world, MY CHILD? Offspring of my\r\nhand, my heart and my soul--Benjamin of my old age! Is THIS the\r\norphanage upon which you have fallen?\r\n\r\nGlancing down the list of writers who have contributed to this November\r\nnumber, I am startled to find the name of Thos. E. Watson.\r\n\r\nWho is _he_, anyhow? Isn’t he the man whom Colonel Mann and DeFrance\r\nhave been slandering through the newspapers? Why put _his_ name into\r\n_this_ pot?\r\n\r\nCurious to see what Mr. Watson may have written for the Thing, I follow\r\nthe page reference (103) and find the familiar headline “EDUCATIONAL\r\nDEPARTMENT.” This department was my own creation, primarily intended for\r\nthe instruction of the younger members of the family. Under the headline\r\nof “Educational Department,” the Thing puts a list of books.\r\n\r\nSome boy wrote to me last winter asking me to name one hundred books\r\nwhich would be useful to the general reader. I made out the list, last\r\nFebruary, and mailed it to New York.\r\n\r\nIn their quandary of dismissing Watson, the man, and holding on to\r\nWatson, the Reputation, _they fished that list of books out of the\r\nwaste-basket_ and published it. _They_ signed my name to it.\r\n\r\nThat’s the only item in the Thing’s “Educational Department.”\r\n\r\nPitiful!\r\n\r\nAt the very time when they are slandering me in the newspapers, and\r\ndenying to me any share in the Magazine which my unpaid labor built up,\r\nMann and DeFrance have the cynical indecency to continue to use my name\r\nas a writer for _their_ magazine.\r\n\r\nTurning to “LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE,” a Department which owes its\r\ncreation to me, I find letters praising “Watson’s Magazine.”\r\n\r\nThe dates are not given. These would have disclosed the fact that the\r\nletters were written before the severance of my connection with the\r\nMagazine. The writers were _my friends_, and by their letters _they had\r\nmeant to encourage me in my work_.\r\n\r\nThe cover of the Magazine bears the name\r\n\r\n  “WATSON’S MAGAZINE COMPANY.”\r\n\r\nThe two individuals who compose this “Company” are Col. W. D. Mann and\r\nC. Q. DeFrance--a very precious “Company.”\r\n\r\nOf my Magazine, Mann took half, and DeFrance took half.\r\n\r\nBy what right?\r\n\r\nConcede that Col. Mann was entitled to grab half of the Magazine because\r\nof the money which he had lost through the stupid mismanagement of the\r\nBusiness Department--where did DeFrance get _his_ right to _the other\r\nhalf_? HE HAS NEVER DONE A LICK OF WORK FOR THE MAGAZINE THAT WASN’T\r\nPAID FOR AT FULL PRICE.\r\n\r\nWhere, then, was HIS right to seize, under legal form, one half of the\r\nMagazine?\r\n\r\nI called him from a very modest position in Nebraska, and put him in the\r\noffice as my personal and political representative. Starting him at $40\r\nper week, I soon advanced him to $60 per week--a higher salary than he\r\nhad ever been paid, by far. I trusted him, implicitly. To the last\r\nmoment, I relied upon him, absolutely.\r\n\r\n_And he betrayed me._ Often have I, like other men, experienced\r\ningratitude; sometimes perfidy--but never have I been stung by such\r\nvenomous and unexpected treachery as that of DeFrance.\r\n\r\nLet it pass.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is another deceptive inscription upon the cover of the November\r\nnumber of the spurious “Watson’s Magazine.” It is the address,\r\n\r\n121 WEST 42 STREET.\r\n\r\nThat is NOT the true address which should be used now. Colonel Mann has\r\ntaken the spurious “Watson’s” into the quarters of his TOWN TOPICS AND\r\nSMART SET. You have perhaps heard of TOWN TOPICS. Also of SMART SET. And\r\na _mighty_ smart set it is, too.\r\n\r\nHereafter, you might as well address all communications intended for the\r\n_spurious_ “Watson’s” IN CARE OF COL. MANN’S TOWN TOPICS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FAKIR AND THE MANIKIN. COL. MANN AND DEFRANCE\r\nVENTRILOQUISING THE BOGUS “WATSON’S MAGAZINE,” NEW YORK.]\r\n\r\nOr, if you prefer, IN CARE OF COL. MANN’S SMART SET.\r\n\r\nLast March the blustering old scamp who rolls around beneath the name of\r\nColonel W. D. Mann, wanted to remove the genuine “Watson’s Magazine”\r\nfrom 42nd Street over to the Smart Set den.\r\n\r\nI declined to let him do it. At that time, DeFrance was still true to\r\nme, and he took the same view of the matter. So anxious was he not to\r\nget mired up in Town Topics mud that he telegraphed me to stand out\r\nagainst Col. Mann and _not_ allow him to make the removal.\r\n\r\nTray, _the faithful_, wanted to keep out of bad company. Tray, the\r\nunfaithful, has now, of his own free will, got into the bad company\r\nwhich he _then_ avoided.\r\n\r\nWatch out, Tray.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first article in the November number of the spurious “Watson’s” is\r\nentitled “EXPLANATORY.” Most of it had already appeared in Colonel\r\nMann’s TOWN TOPICS. The rest of it bears the earmark of DeFrance.\r\n\r\n“EXPLANATORY” was prepared by THE PRESENT EDITORS of the New York\r\n“Watson’s Magazine”--COL. MANN AND DEFRANCE. Well aware of the fact that\r\nthe Public would not patronize _a Reform magazine_ edited by such a\r\ncreature as himself, Col. Mann has rushed into the newspapers with a\r\ndeclaration _that he never saw or heard of_ “EXPLANATORY” _until after\r\nits appearance in the November “Watson’s.”_\r\n\r\nWhat a shameless falsehood!\r\n\r\nCol. Mann and DeFrance fixed up that “EXPLANATORY” mess, and _Mr. Gordon\r\nNye, the artist, was commissioned to take the “Proofs” to Col. Mann for\r\ncorrection_.\r\n\r\nMR. NYE, who is now living with me, ASSURES ME THAT HE CARRIED THESE\r\n“PROOFS” TO COL. MANN’S HOUSE ON 72ND STREET, THAT COL. MANN READ AND\r\nCORRECTED THE “PROOFS,” AND THAT HE MADE CERTAIN ALTERATIONS IN THE\r\nARTICLE.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Nye took the Proofs of “EXPLANATORY” _back to DeFrance_, and\r\ndelivered to that person _the orders of_ THE REAL EDITOR-IN-CHIEF of the\r\nNew York “Watson’s Magazine.”\r\n\r\nFor THE REAL EDITOR-IN-CHIEF of the bogus “Watson’s Magazine” IS COL.\r\nMANN, EDITOR OF TOWN TOPICS AND SMART SET.\r\n\r\nNice Editor-in-Chief _for a reform magazine_, isn’t he?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am going to give, once for all, a simple statement of the whole\r\ntransaction, and then I will try to forget it, in higher, nobler work.\r\nNothing is a more thankless task than the narration of the events\r\nleading to such a climax as this.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the national election of 1904, I went to New York to hold a\r\nconference with our National Chairman, Mr. Ferriss, and with other men\r\nwho had been prominently identified with our side of the campaign. The\r\nconference was held at the office of Mr. Palliser who had been acting\r\nmanager of the campaign in New York. I also wished to confer with Mr.\r\nBrisbane, who had long been urging me to join him in editing the Hearst\r\npapers. He had repeatedly written and telegraphed. A definite offer of\r\n$10,000 to edit Mr. Hearst’s morning paper, the American, had been made.\r\nIf I had been ready to accept a thousand dollars per month, there is no\r\ndoubt that it would have been paid. But while I was powerfully inclined\r\nto cooperate with Brisbane, I did not like to be swallowed up in Hearst.\r\nBesides, to edit a daily paper necessitated my residence in New York,\r\nwhereas my interests, as well as local attachments, were too great to\r\nmake the removal one to which I could readily gain my own consent.\r\n\r\nWhile in this uncertain state of mind, Colonel Mann burst in upon me, at\r\nmy hotel, in all the glory and pomposity of white whiskers, white hair,\r\nwine-colored face, spotted waistcoat, gold-headed cane, baywindow belly,\r\neyes that looked like hard boiled eggs, and a voice thick with\r\nhigh-living and constant use.\r\n\r\nAs I may have remarked before, he looked just like a picture taken out\r\nof a child’s colored picture book.\r\n\r\nWhile he talked to me, I sat there trying to make up my mind as to which\r\nhe resembled most, an idealized portrayal of Santa Claus, or of John\r\nBull, or of John Barlycorn. I finally decided that he would do for a\r\ncomposite photograph of all three.\r\n\r\nThis funny looking old chap I had never heard of before. His Town Topics\r\nI had never seen--didn’t know of its existence.\r\n\r\nHe introduced the purpose of his visit by saying that he had heard of\r\nMr. Hearst’s proposition to me. If I had committed myself to Mr. Hearst,\r\nhe had no more to say; otherwise he had a proposition to submit. Told\r\nthat I was free, he outlined his project.\r\n\r\nHe would finance a great national magazine, if I would edit the same.\r\n\r\nCasually and lightly, he mentioned $100,000 as the amount he would risk\r\non the venture.\r\n\r\nWith that amount he had made _Smart Set_ “go,” and he did not doubt that\r\na like amount would make another magazine “go.”\r\n\r\nEverything must be in my name--corporation, magazine, signboard,\r\ntail-piece and all. Not being particularly ashamed of my name, I had no\r\nobjection to this.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as I belonged to a political party which had just demonstrated\r\nto its own satisfaction that it was the most unpopular political\r\nconglomeration on the face of the earth, I imagined that such a fine\r\nlooking old personage as Col. Mann--calling himself a Democrat--was\r\nafraid he would deface his own reputation by associating with a\r\npolitical outcast, like me, and that, therefore, while willing to\r\npocket all the money the magazine might earn, he didn’t want his name to\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nConsiderate old buck, he wouldn’t hurt my feelings by using the plebeian\r\nword “salary.” The word “compensation” was likewise too vulgar to be\r\napplied to my monthly and yearly stipend. With a rich roll in his deep\r\nbass voice, he mentioned the “_honorarium_” which I was to receive for\r\nmy work. My “_honorarium_” was to be $500 per month. Besides, my\r\ntraveling expenses to and from New York were to be paid.\r\n\r\nHe emphasized the fact that, under his proposition, I would not have to\r\nlive in New York. A monthly visit was contemplated, but never made\r\ncompulsory, save upon the summons of the Board of Directors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EVEN IF THEY COULD BEND THE BOW, THEY HAVE NOT THE\r\nARROWS.]\r\n\r\nFor several reasons, Col. Mann’s proposition impressed me favorably.\r\nFirst, it preserved my identity. Second, it left me free to say just\r\nwhat I pleased. Third, it did not take me away from my home--to which I\r\nam tenderly attached. My ancestors helped to clear the primeval forest\r\noff these old red hills of Georgia, and I love them, as I could love no\r\nother land under the sun.\r\n\r\nFor these several reasons, I practically decided, then and there, to\r\naccept Col. Mann’s proposition. He saw this--being a shrewd old\r\nfellow--and did his utmost to get me to his office, in order that the\r\ncontract might be drawn up and signed before I left New York.\r\n\r\nBut I was not _quite_ so much of a greenhorn as all that. I refused to\r\nclose the deal, then, but asked him to send his proposition, in writing,\r\nto me in Georgia.\r\n\r\nReturning home, I fell sick. Overwork, mental strain, sleeplessness,\r\nworry, etc., stretched me out. Unable to return to New York after Col.\r\nMann had mailed me the proposed contract, I decided to place myself in\r\nthe hands of a friend.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. John H. Girdner, a native of Greenville, Tenn., had been one of my\r\nmost prominent and active supporters in New York during the campaign of\r\n1904. Previously he had been widely known as the political lieutenant\r\nand confidential friend of Mr. Bryan. Previous to that, he was well\r\nknown as the family physician and political follower of Mr. Cleveland.\r\n\r\nHaving long been a resident of New York, Dr. Girdner seemed to me the\r\nideal man to represent me in the negotiations with Col. Mann.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor accepted the trust, and finally sent me the contract for\r\nsignature. Some alterations in it had been made. One of these, and the\r\nmost important, was the creation of the office of Associate Editor, at a\r\nsalary of “_not exceeding_” $4,000 per year. This office was to be\r\npersonal to me. That is, I could make and unmake Associate Editors at\r\nwill, _provided_ Col. Mann did not have to pay them _more_ than $4,000\r\nper year.\r\n\r\nIn communicating this feature of the contract to me, Dr. Girdner\r\nsignified his willingness to fill that position. It gave me great\r\npleasure to appoint him. Nothing was ever said by the Doctor or myself\r\nconcerning the amount that he was to receive, but he assumed, quite\r\ncorrectly, that it would be proper for him to draw the full $4,000, and\r\nhe began to do so.\r\n\r\nNot once did Dr. Girdner intimate to me that a business connection with\r\nCol. Mann would disgrace me. How could I suppose that such a connection\r\nwas undesirable when Dr. Girdner himself was willing to make it? I am\r\nsure that the Doctor did not know what all the world now knows.\r\n\r\nIt cost the Colliers $75,000 and months of hard work, to gather up the\r\nevidence which proved what kind of a person Col. Mann is. How could Dr.\r\nGirdner know, IN 1904, those facts which it cost Collier $75,000 to\r\nprove IN 1905? The Doctor knew no more about it than I did--or he would\r\nhave warned me to keep out, and would have kept out himself.\r\n\r\nWhen I went to New York in the mid-winter of 1904-5 to organize the\r\nCompany, Col. Mann opened another leaf in his book.\r\n\r\nHe presented a paper containing stock subscriptions to his Syndicate,\r\nand asked me to “come in.” I was fool enough to sign for $2,500.\r\n\r\nHad the old scamp not over-reached himself, he would have got me for\r\n$2,500, _besides the $9,000 hereinafter mentioned_. But he _did\r\noverreach_ himself. He had his man, Daniels, to present _another paper_\r\nfor me to sign. It was the lease of the house we were to occupy, 121\r\nWest 42nd Street. The amount was $1,200.\r\n\r\nTHEN, I smelt the rat. I not only refused to sign the lease, but, acting\r\nunder a natural revulsion of feeling, I cancelled my subscription to the\r\nSyndicate. Had Col. Mann said a single word against my doing so, _I\r\nwould have cancelled the whole contract_--for the suspicion had then\r\ncrept into my mind that he was--what I now know him to be--A GRAND OLD\r\nRASCAL.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhy, then, did I go on with the Magazine?\r\n\r\nBecause I was fastened. Because I had publicly pledged my word. Because\r\nthe contract gave me complete control of the Magazine, therefore Col.\r\nMann could not hurt it. Me he _could_ hurt; me he _did_ hurt, but the\r\nMAGAZINE WAS, IS NOW, AND EVER SHALL BE, ABOVE AND BEYOND HIS REACH.\r\nThank God!\r\n\r\nThe soul of the Magazine was the breath of life which Jehovah breathed\r\ninto _me_; and Col. Mann can no more defile it by his touch than he can\r\ndefile me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI commenced working industriously for the Magazine in December 1904.\r\nHundreds of letters were mailed from my house every month. Hundreds of\r\nsubscribers enrolled themselves and paid their money in advance of the\r\npublication. I paid my own assistants, paid the postage, worked for\r\nnothing. _It wasn’t the money that I was after._ Col. Mann saw that,\r\n_and took every advantage of it_.\r\n\r\nNot a cent of the small sum that was paid me came out of _his_ pocket. I\r\nam glad to be able to say so.\r\n\r\nBut while money-making was not my purpose, I could not contemplate with\r\nany satisfaction the prospect of _never_ being able to get anything for\r\nmy labor. The Magazine was bearing upon me heavily. The contract only\r\nasked 3,000 words per month of me. After the first few numbers, my task\r\nwas never less than about 20,000 words\r\n\r\nAll this work I did with my own hand. Mr. Duffy, the Managing Editor,\r\nhad a stenographer. Mr. Flaacke, Advertising Manager, had a\r\nstenographer; Mr. DeFrance, Business Manager, had a stenographer. I am\r\nnot sure about Mr. Hoffman and the office boy, Robert, but I guess they\r\nhad one too. _The Editor-in-Chief was the only member of the staff who\r\nhad to do his own work._\r\n\r\nFinally, the toil became so irksome--especially during the Georgia\r\ncampaign of 1906, when Everybody and his Uncle and his Aunt were jumping\r\non me--that _I begged DeFrance to allow me six dollars per week for a\r\nstenographer_. He did so for several weeks and then quit. In ceasing to\r\nhelp me to this pitiful extent, he gave me neither excuse nor\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nHe himself was all the while drawing his $60 per week, for dictating to\r\na fifteen-dollar-per-week stenographer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“EXPLANATORY” alleges that I usurped authority, and began to discharge\r\nemployes as though the Magazine were my personal property.\r\n\r\n“EXPLANATORY” says that, unfortunately, I was allowed to have my way in\r\na great many business matters.\r\n\r\nThe new Editors, Mann and DeFrance, give _no specifications_.\r\n\r\nI WILL GIVE SOME.\r\n\r\nInto _the very first number of the Magazine_, Col. Mann inserted a full\r\npage _advertisement of some of his nasty_ “SMART SET” _books_. When I\r\nsaw that advertisement, which _had been slipped into the magazine\r\nwithout my knowledge_, Ted Flaacke, Advertising Manager, was summoned to\r\nmy room, and _told that there wasn’t money enough in New York to buy\r\nspace in my Magazine for prurient literature of that sort_.\r\n\r\nI peremptorily demanded that the filthy thing be kept out, and _it was\r\nkept out_. It is due Mr. Flaacke to say, that _he, himself, had known\r\nnothing of the ad. until the magazine was out_.\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of Col. Mann’s displeasure. He realized that he\r\ncould _never make a tool of me_--as he is now making of DeFrance.\r\n\r\nThe _Titles_ of some of those books are as follows:\r\n\r\n“An Eclipse of Virtue,”\r\n\r\n“Margaret’s Misadventure,”\r\n\r\n“Naughty Elizabeth,”\r\n\r\n“Sweet Sin,”\r\n\r\n“The Ashes of Desire,”\r\n\r\n“An Unspeakable Siren,” etc., etc.\r\n\r\nNow, it may be that these books are not so bad as their names would\r\nindicate--I have never read them--_but Col. Mann meant_ by these titles,\r\n_to cater to the diseased taste for erotic literature_. Hence HE SLIPPED\r\nTHE AD. IN, without notice to me or to Ted Flaacke. THAT AD., IN OUR\r\nVERY FIRST NUMBER, HURT THE MAGAZINE SERIOUSLY. I felt that Col. Mann\r\nhad no right to degrade the Magazine by making it a distributor of vile\r\nbooks, hence my positive instructions to Mr. Flaacke. In justice to this\r\ngentleman, I should say that he agreed with me fully.\r\n\r\nAgain: Col. Mann placed the Business Management in the hands of a young\r\ncoal-dealer who knew nothing whatever about Circulation Management, nor\r\nabout Business Management of that kind. He was a most amiable young\r\ngentleman and perfectly honest. I liked him personally, very much. But,\r\nunfortunately, he was addicted to the use of intoxicating liquors--even\r\nduring business hours--and frequently attempted to perform the duties\r\nwhen too much inebriated to do so. Dr. Girdner first called my attention\r\nto this, and then DeFrance. Our business affairs soon suffered so much\r\nfrom the young man’s infirmity, that both Dr. Girdner and DeFrance\r\nsuggested that we make a change. I took the matter up with Col. Mann,\r\n_who had himself began to find fault with the young man_, and the result\r\nwas that he was requested to resign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROCKETT MANN AND THE SOCIETY COONS.]\r\n\r\nDeFrance had wanted the young man’s place, and he got it, _with an\r\nincrease of salary_. It was at my instance that DeFrance was thus\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEvery change made by me was made in the interest of economy, and\r\nresulted in benefit.\r\n\r\nI wanted to make other changes, for the same reason.\r\n\r\nWe paid Mr. Flaacke in salary and expense account, about $5,000 per\r\nyear, and never got advertising enough to pay the bill. I wanted to stop\r\nthat nonsense, and to put Mr. Flaacke on the commission basis.\r\n\r\n_I shouldn’t wonder if Col. Mann has, himself, now made that very\r\nchange._\r\n\r\nThe Managing Editor was getting $50 per week for doing work which his\r\nassistant, Mr. Hoffman, could, as I thought, do as well. I wanted to put\r\nthe work on Mr. Hoffman, and save the larger salary.\r\n\r\n_I note with interest that Col. Mann has, himself, made that very\r\nchange._\r\n\r\nThus THEY, THEMSELVES, VINDICATE ME, unintentionally, from the\r\naccusations they make.\r\n\r\n_Col. Mann approved every change I made while I was in charge, and he\r\nnow makes the other changes for which I contended._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Edgerton went out, it had been demonstrated that the Magazine was\r\nnot going to “boom” as Colonel Mann had expected, and that _economy_\r\nwould be the law of its life.\r\n\r\nSeeing that two offices could be combined, at a saving of $45 per week,\r\nI made the change, _after full consultation with Col. Mann at Col.\r\nMann’s house_.\r\n\r\nAs to Dr. Girdner, Col. Mann had kicked at that from the beginning.\r\n\r\nFrom what others told me, I know that Col. Mann vigorously objected to\r\nDr. Girdner as Associate Editor.\r\n\r\nI know that from time to time Col. Mann would inquire, “_Does Watson\r\nstill want that fellow Girdner?_” I myself heard Col. Mann find fault\r\nwith the Doctor for putting two signed articles in one number of the\r\nMagazine.\r\n\r\nAnd I MYSELF HEARD COL. MANN SAY, to me and others, in his own office,\r\n“_I don’t believe Dr. Girdner could ever write a good article._”\r\n\r\nWhen Col. Mann asked me whether Dr. Girdner were INDISPENSABLE TO ME, I\r\nfrankly and truthfully said that he was not. THE COLONEL WANTED TO STOP\r\nTHAT SALARY. The Doctor was not willing to let his “_honorarium_”\r\naccumulate on the books. Like a sensible man, he was insisting upon\r\ndrawing what was due him.\r\n\r\nThis was HURTING COL. MANN. Hurting him very much. Therefore, AFTER\r\nFIRST ASCERTAINING THAT I WOULD REMAIN IN OFFICE, he put Girdner out,\r\nhimself. As between an Editor who cashed in his “_honorarium_,” and one\r\nthat allowed _his_ to accumulate on the books, who could doubt which the\r\nColonel would prefer?\r\n\r\nIt was I who INSISTED THAT COLONEL MANN PAY DR. GIRDNER A SUM WHICH THE\r\nDOCTOR NATURALLY CLAIMED AS COMPENSATION FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT.\r\n\r\nDr. Girdner himself should know best why he quit us, and the Doctor has\r\nwritten me a letter in which he says,\r\n\r\n  “I resigned the position of associate editor because my salary had not\r\n  been paid for several months, and from the methods of the company and\r\n  the report of its treasurer I did not think it was likely to be paid\r\n  in future.\r\n\r\n  Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n  JOHN H. GIRDNER.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“EXPLANATORY” has much to say about my son.\r\n\r\nThe facts are these:\r\n\r\nMy son had been under Dr. Girdner’s professional treatment. He soon\r\nbegan to show a marked improvement, and I realized the helpfulness to my\r\nboy of _giving him something to do_. He was naturally eager to work with\r\nhis father. I, therefore, went to the Business Manager and sought work\r\nfor my son, just as I would have done for a stranger.\r\n\r\nI said, both to Mr. Green and Col. Mann, “I don’t know _how_ he will do,\r\nor _what_ he will be worth, but please _give him a trial_. If he makes\r\ngood, pay him what the work is worth. If he does not make good, I will\r\nnot expect you to keep him, and you can charge his salary up to me\r\nduring the time he will have been here.”\r\n\r\nThat’s exactly the way it was. My son commenced work, and when I next\r\nwent to New York all of them told me--and were apparently delighted to\r\ntell me--that he had made good.\r\n\r\nFrom Dr. Girdner down, they all spoke affectionately of him, and\r\ndeclared that he was one of the steadiest, quietest employes at the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nAs his strength returned, his usefulness increased and I advanced him to\r\nmore important and responsible duties than had at first been put upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nTo encourage my boy, and bring out what was best in him, I _did_ advance\r\nhim from time to time. WHO WILL BLAME ME FOR WANTING TO MAKE A MAN OUT\r\nOF MY ONLY SON?\r\n\r\nIt was my most earnest desire to train my son in journalism, so that he\r\ncould take my place when I should have served out my time and passed\r\naway:--to that purpose I _still_ cling with a resolution that nothing\r\ncan break.\r\n\r\nAt the time DeFrance and Col. Mann kicked him out, he was doing the\r\n“News Record” and “The Say of Other Editors.” He was doing it well, as\r\nthe Magazine will show for itself.\r\n\r\nHe was being paid $40 per week. This was $10 per week _less_ than\r\nEdgerton had received for the same work.\r\n\r\nWhen I gave my son the place, another position which he had filled\r\nacceptably to the Business Manager, at $15 per week, was abolished.\r\n_Thus, even at the highest salary ever paid my son, he saved the Company\r\n$25 per week._\r\n\r\nI am accused of having mistreated Mr. Edgerton. The facts are these: _he\r\nwas already working in New York_ when he applied to me for a job on the\r\nMagazine. I personally requested Col. Mann to take him on. After much\r\nhesitation and seeming reluctance, Col. Mann consented. When reductions\r\nof expenses became necessary, Mr. Edgerton’s _weekly salary_ was reduced\r\nto $40. He told me that he would hold the job _until he could get\r\nanother_. I did not think he could render us very good service _in that\r\nstate of mind_, and I therefore relieved him of duty. _He had already\r\nmade $1,200 out of the job_--probably THE EASIEST MONEY THAT HE HAD EVER\r\nEARNED.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“EXPLANATORY” says that at a meeting of the Board of Directors in\r\nNovember 1905, I agreed to contribute $5,000 to a fund of $25,000, and\r\nthen broke my word.\r\n\r\nThe facts are these:\r\n\r\nAfter repeated efforts to get some satisfaction out of Col. Mann, I was\r\ndrawn to New York in November 1905 by a most positive written promise of\r\nhis to settle with me if I would come to see him.\r\n\r\nI went.\r\n\r\nAt Col. Mann’s house on 72nd Street, there was a gathering of the\r\nleading stockholders and leading employes. As each reported for his own\r\ndepartment the employes were excused, and they went away. Mr. Flaacke\r\nspoke his piece and departed. Mr. Duffy, ditto. Finally the assemblage\r\ndwindled down to just me and the Colonel.\r\n\r\nBut, _before this_, Col. Mann had suggested that we raise some money,\r\nand asked me IF I DID NOT HAVE SOME FRIENDS THAT I COULD PREVAIL ON TO\r\n“COME IN.” The suggestion was put out of business immediately. I was in\r\nthe trap all right enough, and I DIDN’T INTEND TO BE USED AS A BAIT.\r\nThen he asked if I would not continue to work for the Magazine without\r\npay to the amount of $5,000.\r\n\r\nI ANSWERED, “YES.”\r\n\r\nIn that very connection, however, he had stated, again, his intention to\r\npay me the amount already due, and which he had promised to pay if I\r\nwould come to New York.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TOWN TOPICS DEN INTO WHICH COL. MANN HAS MOVED THE\r\nBOGUS WATSON’S MAGAZINE.]\r\n\r\nBut to my amazement he had stated it this way:\r\n\r\n“I WILL PAY IT, BUT NOT NOW.”\r\n\r\nEvery one who was present must remember these words.\r\n\r\nI said nothing at all in reply, but after all the others had retired, _I\r\nremained behind and I reminded the Colonel courteously, of his pledge_\r\nto pay me when I came to New York. I asked that he pay me at least HALF\r\nTHE AMOUNT DUE.\r\n\r\nHe hung his head, for an instant only, and then, raising a flushed face,\r\ntold me he would see what he could do, and give me a reply next day.\r\n\r\nHe complained of the heavy expense of his recent litigation, alluding of\r\ncourse to the celebrated Collier-Hapgood Libel Case and the subsequent\r\nprosecution of himself for perjury.\r\n\r\nNext day he wrote me a long, sweet, persuasive letter begging me to WAIT\r\nON HIM UNTIL JULY, 1906, at which time he would most assuredly pay. It\r\nwas _then_ that I did what I should have done at first--consulted a New\r\nYork lawyer.\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser advised me to make an end of the matter _then_, and I\r\nshould have taken his advice; but I loved my work and my Magazine, and\r\nat the last moment I yielded and let Col. Mann have his own way.\r\n\r\nFrom motives that he is unable to understand or appreciate, I WOULD HAVE\r\nCONTINUED THE UNPAID SLAVE OF THE MAGAZINE, INDEFINITELY, HAD NOT HE AND\r\nDEFRANCE MADE THE SITUATION INTOLERABLE. I felt my obligations to the\r\nsubscribers: my pride in the success of the Magazine which bore my name\r\nwas deeply involved. This was well known both to Col. Mann and DeFrance,\r\n_and they presumed, upon it--once too often_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt may be asked why I did not cut loose from THE TOWN TOPICS GANG\r\n_after_ the exposures in the Collier-Hapgood Case. Simply because Col.\r\nMann had nothing on earth to do with what I regarded as the Magazine, to\r\nwit--its policy, its purpose, its message. _That_ was the life of the\r\nMagazine. THAT, in my eyes, WAS THE MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nI did not want to leave the subscribers in the lurch, nor did I want to\r\nabandon a field of labor in which I seemed to be doing a good work.\r\n\r\nEvery man who has a purpose in life and who loves his work, will\r\nunderstand me.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when Clark Howell and others jumped on me for being connected\r\nwith a person who was being denounced throughout the land as a\r\nblackmailer, I put the case on the strongest ground by saying, “I AM THE\r\nMAGAZINE.” That was true. DeFrance and Mann _were glad enough to have me\r\ncheck defection_ from the Magazine by saying it THEN.\r\n\r\nIn a very short while _they will_ WISH THAT THEY HAD ANOTHER METHOD,\r\nEQUALLY GOOD, OF CHECKING DEFECTION. The subscribers to the magazine\r\nthat was mine are not going to endorse what Col. Mann has done, nor\r\nremain with a magazine which HE controls--_never in the world_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf Colonel Mann had not lost his senses, in his haste to grab the\r\nMagazine, name and all, he would have foreseen _the utter folly of\r\ntrying to run the thing in my name_ AFTER I HAD GONE OUT. A _new_\r\nMagazine, under a _new_ name, he could establish at LESS EXPENSE THAN HE\r\nWILL INCUR IN THE VAIN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN A WATSON’S MAGAZINE WITHOUT\r\nWATSON. A child ought to be able to see that. What possible good will\r\n_my name_ be to him when he himself publishes the statement that _I_ am\r\nout?\r\n\r\nTHE NAME WITHOUT THE MAN WILL BE A DEAD WEIGHT TO THE MAGAZINE, as Col.\r\nMann has, doubtless, begun to find out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THEY HAVE A CORPSE ON THEIR HANDS; THE SPIRIT ESCAPED\r\nTHEIR CLUTCH.]\r\n\r\nHONESTY, in THIS case at least, should have been his POLICY. It would\r\nhave paid him better in the long run.\r\n\r\nCol. Mann rushed into court, got a judgment against the Magazine for\r\n$60,000; _and sold it_, at Sheriff’s sale, _to himself_.\r\n\r\nHe actually _had the Sheriff to sell my name, and was ass enough to buy\r\nit_.\r\n\r\nBut he didn’t buy _me_, along with the name, and he didn’t buy _the\r\nspirit of the Magazine_ when he bought the desks, the iron-safe and the\r\ntrade name.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable asset, he could not, and _cannot_ reach.\r\n\r\nThat’s the Good Will, the Reputation, the Demand!\r\n\r\nThis is the _real asset_--THE ONLY ASSET WORTH HAVING.\r\n\r\nThis asset, in equity and good conscience, _belongs to me, by the most\r\nsacred of all titles_--THE WORKMAN’S RIGHT TO THE PRODUCT OF HIS LABOR.\r\n\r\nSince it is mine, I mean to have it--in spite of all that Col. Mann may\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“EXPLANATORY” will seek in vain to convince any considerable number of\r\npeople that I quit the Magazine on a mere question of salary.\r\n\r\n_That is the very thing that I always subordinated to other and higher\r\nconsiderations._\r\n\r\nIn some directions Col. Mann lavished money like a prince; in others, he\r\ndoled it out like a miser.\r\n\r\nThus he squandered $12,000 in advertisements in daily newspapers, where\r\nthey were not worth a hill of beans, and REFUSED TO FURNISH MONEY TO PAY\r\nABSOLUTELY NECESSARY POSTAGE on sample copies.\r\n\r\nHe wasted $5,000 trying to run the advertising department on a fancy\r\nschedule, and REFUSED TO PAY THE AUTHORS WHO SUPPLIED US WITH THE\r\nNECESSARIES OF LIFE. Sometimes the writers who had been so badly treated\r\nhad to threaten attachments, before they could get their money; and upon\r\none occasion DEFRANCE HAD TO SNEAK OUT OF THE OFFICE TO AVOID AN IRATE\r\nAUTHOR WHO HAD COME UPON THE SCENE WITH THE RIOT ACT IN HIS HAND.\r\n\r\nTalk about _me_ as the man who acted as if I wanted to “wreck” my\r\nnamesake? What could damage the Magazine more surely and seriously than\r\nsuch management as _this_? We got a bad name among _writers_, because we\r\ntook their MSS. and then failed to pay. We got a bad name among\r\n_advertisers_, because ads were inserted upon almost any terms. We got a\r\nbad name among _subscribers_, because DeFrance allowed business letters\r\nto go unanswered, and because Wm. Green, the Publisher, dribbled the\r\nmailing of every issue through TWO FULL WEEKS.\r\n\r\nThese were the difficulties with which I had to contend. The country is\r\nfull of people who wanted to patronize us and befriend us and help us,\r\nbut who became so disgusted at not getting their magazines, and not\r\ngetting answers to their letters, that they simply quit us in despair.\r\n\r\n_Would DeFrance like to see a list of their names?_\r\n\r\nI can furnish him with a good long one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn one occasion Col. Mann was eager to have me send a cablegram, through\r\nour State Department, to our Minister at St. Petersburg, offering a\r\nthousand dollars to Maxim Gorky--then in prison--for an article for the\r\nMagazine.\r\n\r\nTHAT VERY WEEK I HAD TO TAKE THE MONEY OUT OF MY POCKET TO PAY THE GIRLS\r\nWHO WORKED IN THE OFFICE.\r\n\r\nUpon another occasion, he ordered the sale, AS JUNK, of 60,000 copies of\r\nthe Magazine WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN WRAPPED AND ADDRESSED AND MADE READY\r\nFOR MAILING AS SAMPLE COPIES. They were SOLD AS WASTE PAPER BECAUSE HE\r\nREFUSED TO FURNISH MONEY TO PAY POSTAGE.\r\n\r\nColonel Mann’s business was the publishing of magazines. Naturally, I\r\nassumed that _he was an expert at that business_. It never occurred to\r\nme that I could be of any service in the business management until his\r\nabsurd mistakes forced themselves upon my attention.\r\n\r\nTHE COLLIER TRIAL SEEMED TO ESTABLISH THE FACT THAT HIS WAY OF MAKING\r\nMONEY OUT OF HIS OTHER MAGAZINES WAS THE SYSTEMATIC BLACKMAILING OF\r\nSOCIETY SWELLS AND WALL STREET THIEVES.\r\n\r\nWhen he stands his trial for Perjury in the case now pending, the world\r\nwill doubtless learn other peculiarities which characterize his\r\nmanagement of magazines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI wanted the Magazine to be a success, and I knew that it could _not_\r\nsucceed as then managed. Hence, my offer to continue, indefinitely, to\r\nwork without compensation provided I were allowed to make those changes\r\nwhich I knew to be absolutely essential to final success.\r\n\r\nTo this effect I wrote to the Managing Editor, and to DeFrance. No reply\r\nwas made by the management.\r\n\r\nThen I overcame my repugnance to Col. Mann, and wrote _him_--telling him\r\nwhat ailed the Magazine, how it could be put on its feet and offering to\r\nmake a success, of it--without salary in the meanwhile--if he would let\r\nme do it.\r\n\r\nTo my original conditions, however, I added another, namely, THAT\r\nDEFRANCE MUST GO. After the way in which he had acted, and after the two\r\ninsulting letters which he had written me, it was no longer possible for\r\nus to work together.\r\n\r\nCol. Mann did not answer my letter at all.\r\n\r\nHe had _DeFrance_ to telegraph me _a request_ that I send the\r\nEditorials, and _a promise_ that they would treat me right.\r\n\r\nBy having DeFrance send the message, I knew that he meant to keep\r\nDeFrance--and that let me out.\r\n\r\nDeFrance had already notified me that half of my magazine belonged to\r\n_him_, and half to Col. Mann, and there was no arrangement that could be\r\nmade on that basis.\r\n\r\nBesides, Col. Mann, after my letter was written and before its receipt,\r\nby him, had rushed into the New York _World_ with an interview which\r\nlibelled me basely and cruelly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet me say, in justice to a most estimable gentleman, that I had no\r\nquarrel with Mr. Richard Duffy. He is peculiarly well fitted to make a\r\nfirst-class editor of a literary magazine. His standards are high and\r\nhis judgment sound. He was not, however, particularly suited to a\r\npolitical magazine--never having devoted any special study to Political\r\nEconomy and Governmental questions. In my contemplated change in the\r\nEditorial Staff, I was not actuated by any dislike of Mr. Duffy. My\r\nmotive was simply that of the mariner who sacrifices a portion of his\r\ncargo to save his ship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“EXPLANATORY” makes as much as possible out of the weekly cheque of\r\n$125, sent to me “during the busy part of the subscription season.”\r\n\r\nYes, they sent me cheques to the amount of one thousand dollars, at a\r\ntime when _subscriptions were pouring in at the rate of two and three\r\nthousand per week_.\r\n\r\nBut “EXPLANATORY” does not state the fact that NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS\r\nREPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF UNPAID HONEST, HARD WORK DONE BY ME ON THE\r\nMAGAZINE and that Col. Mann told the newspaper reporters, brazenly, that\r\nHE NEVER INTENDED TO PAY A RED CENT OF IT.\r\n\r\n_Perhaps_, the sum-total paid me during the two years _would cover my\r\nactual expense-account in working for the Magazine_. It certainly would\r\nnot do more than that.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“EXPLANATORY” dwells upon my ceasing to visit New York, once a month.\r\n\r\nDrawing no salary, paying my own traveling expenses, and being made more\r\nor less ill by each of these long trips, I discontinued them. Editorials\r\nfor a monthly magazine can be written down here in Georgia just about as\r\nwell as in New York, and postage stamps cost less than railroad tickets.\r\n\r\nEverything that I was allowed to do for the Magazine could be done just\r\nas well by mail as by personal presence.\r\n\r\nAs to refusing to make a final trip to seek “an amicable adjustment,” I\r\nwrote to DeFrance that the proposition referred to already WAS MY LAST\r\nWORD, and that there was no use in my coming to New York to say it\r\nagain. Col. Mann could accept or reject--I was not going there to listen\r\nto any more of his coaxing, bluffing and lies.\r\n\r\nBesides, to tell the whole truth, I was not sorry that THE TIME HAD COME\r\nWHEN I COULD CUT LOOSE FROM THIS FAT RASCAL. _After_ I had worked on and\r\non; _after_ he had broken promise upon promise; _after_ he had sued the\r\nMagazine for $60,000 and got an execution against it; _after_ he had\r\nshown that he wanted me to continue indefinitely to do ten times as much\r\nwork as the contract called for, and to _never have any share in the\r\nreward that might be reaped from my labors_; _after_ he had broken the\r\ncontract by dismissing my son from a position which was my personal\r\nappointment; _after_ he had rushed into the newspapers and confirmed my\r\nsuspicion of his villainous purpose by revealing his utter and shameless\r\ndisregard for his contracts, THEN my conscience and my judgment\r\nconcurred in the decision to cut loose from the New York concern and\r\nSTART A MAGAZINE OF MY OWN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot a second thought have I given to the loss of the $9,000. But THAT\r\nwasn’t all. Col. Mann assailed me. The odium of a catastrophe which was\r\nthe result of his own folly, faithlessness and lack of honor, he tried\r\nto cast upon me. In his efforts to escape universal contempt, he lied\r\nlike a bulletin.\r\n\r\nBetrayed by one whom I selected as my personal representative in the\r\noffice and whom I advanced from Circulation Clerk to Business Manager;\r\naccused of a mismanagement which I endeavored in vain to correct; held\r\nup to public criticism for mistreatment of employes when I had never\r\nuttered an unkind word to a single one of them, high or low, during the\r\nwhole time of my service, and when I had never made a change in the\r\nforce that was not sanctioned in advance, by Colonel Mann himself, I now\r\nfeel that burning sense of the injustice and outrage which any other man\r\nof spirit would feel under the same circumstances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith an effrontery which nothing could surpass, the two men who have\r\nseized my magazine on the half and half plan _are mailing out a circular\r\nletter begging Reformers to take shares in the stock of the new\r\nCompany_.\r\n\r\nThis circular carries Deception on its very face. It purports to hail\r\nfrom “_2 West 40th Street_.”\r\n\r\nWhat is “2 West 40th Street”?\r\n\r\nWhy, IT IS THE SIDE-DOOR TO THE NOTORIOUS TOWN TOPICS DEN INTO WHICH\r\nDEFRANCE AND COL. MANN HAVE DRAGGED THE CORPSE OF “WATSON’S MAGAZINE.”\r\n\r\nThe FRONT of Col. Mann’s trap is on FIFTH AVENUE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARCADES AMBO!]\r\n\r\nNow DeFrance and Mann _knew very well that there wasn’t a decent man in\r\nAmerica who would knowingly send a dollar to buy stock of Col. Mann at\r\nthe Town Topics address_. Hence in their efforts to lure pigeons into\r\nthe net, they use _the side-door address which no one who is not\r\nfamiliar with the building would ever know to be the same building_.\r\n\r\nOH, THE SHAME OF IT, DEFRANCE! And YOU were the man whom I selected AS\r\nMY PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE IN THE OFFICE, and who TELEGRAPHED ME TO FORT\r\nLAUDERDALE LAST WINTER URGING ME TO RESIST COL. MANN’S REMOVAL OF THE\r\nMAGAZINE TO THE TOWN TOPICS BUILDING!\r\n\r\nWith pathetic insistence, they are sending out this circular letter from\r\nthis Town Topics Side-Entrance addressed,\r\n\r\n“_Dear Friend._”\r\n\r\nI wonder how many dear friends Col. Mann imagines himself to possess.\r\n\r\n_I wonder how many of DeFrance’s dear friends will follow him into_ THAT\r\nMANN-HOLE.\r\n\r\nThe letter makes the modest request that a few thousand ardent admirers\r\nof DeFrance buy stock in the Side-Door concern at $10 per share.\r\n\r\nDeFrance tearfully ejaculates, “_I don’t ask you to donate the Money.\r\nFar from it._”\r\n\r\n_How_ far from it, he doesn’t say. _The confiding individual who bites\r\nat that bait, and pours ten dollars into that Mann-hole will see a good\r\ndeal of ice in August before he will ever see his money again._\r\n\r\nThink of the impudent falsehood of the assertion made in this circular\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n“The magazine, while not yet profitable, has nearly reached that point.”\r\nTherefore, send your money to the Side-Door concern right away. Yet, in\r\nthe next breath, he claims that Col. Mann lost $180,000 in less than two\r\nyears on the Magazine.\r\n\r\nTo cap the climax of his wrong-doing, DeFrance actually signs the\r\nBegging Letter as _Secretary of the People’s Party National Committee_.\r\n\r\nBy what right?\r\n\r\nUnder whose authority does he act _when he thus prostitutes that office\r\nto the service of Col. W. D. Mann_?\r\n\r\nWhat will our National Committee think of it when they _behold their\r\nSecretary standing at the Side Door of the Town Topics building and hear\r\nhim calling for Populists to walk up and enter the Mann-hole, to the\r\ntune of_ “TEN DOLLARS ADMISSION FEE, PLEASE”?\r\n\r\nDeFrance has now stooped _to do the very thing that Col. Mann tried\r\nvainly to get me to do_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI wonder if those New York rascals really thought that I would quietly\r\nsit down and twiddle my thumbs while they were making off with “Watson’s\r\nMagazine”? I wonder if it never entered into those heads, which were\r\nbent together to plot and to scheme, that the consequence of their\r\npretty little game MIGHT be a Revolt of Watson and HIS FRIENDS.\r\n\r\nUnless I am greatly mistaken, _the subscribers_ to “Watson’s Magazine”\r\n_are Mr. Watson’s friends_, and THEY ARE GOING TO STAND BY HIM. We shall\r\nsee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter all, why worry over it? Life is too short to waste many of its\r\nprecious hours upon such a theme. Looked at in one way, those who\r\nthought to crush me have done me a service.\r\n\r\nThey have put into me, once more, that intensity of energy and purpose\r\nwhich, otherwise, might never have been mine again. What the spur is to\r\nthe thoroughbred, what the bugle-call is to the cavalier, the recent\r\nattempts of my enemies to compass my ruin has been to me.\r\n\r\nBy the living God! HERE is no thought of surrender, no weakness of doubt\r\nor hesitation, but a resolution, fixed as hardened steel, to MARCH ON.\r\n\r\nWhat! Be a quitter NOW? Falter or flicker NOW? Lower the flag and stack\r\narms, NOW?\r\n\r\nRather, would I die.\r\n\r\nThe ear of the world is at last inclined to us, and the heart of mankind\r\nis at length being touched by our message.\r\n\r\nThe long march of the despised Reformer is nearing its end. His final\r\ntriumph no sane observer, no watchman upon the tower, can longer doubt.\r\n\r\nHalt NOW? Never in the world.\r\n\r\nDesert NOW? Heaven forbid!\r\n\r\nWhy, for fifteen years we have walked amid the shadows of social and\r\npolitical ostracism, never swerving an inch from the rocky road of\r\nDuty--do they think we shall walk less firmly _now_, when the sunlight\r\nis falling upon the path?\r\n\r\nTimes have changed. Men have changed. The principles for which we fought\r\nhave _not_ changed. THEY HAVE CONQUERED.\r\n\r\nThe strong man and shrewd politician at the White House laid his\r\nattentive ear to the ground, quite a while ago, and heard distant\r\nrumblings that taught him useful lessons.\r\n\r\nThe strong man and shrewd politician at Fair View, Nebraska, has had his\r\nattentive ear to the ground and he, likewise, has learned his lesson.\r\n\r\nThe next time Mr. Watson of Georgia goes to Nebraska for the purpose of\r\nhelping Mr. Bryan to carry his home State for Reform, I venture the\r\nprediction that Mr. Bryan will not leave Nebraska to avoid contact with\r\nMr. Watson--as he did in 1896.\r\n\r\nThe battle-flag of a great people, inspired by a resistless purpose to\r\nassert the right of THE INDIVIDUAL to wrest the government of the\r\ncountry out of the hands of the MONSTER CORPORATION will, beyond all\r\npossible doubt, be inscribed with those mottoes which for fifteen years\r\nhave been our watchwords in the fight and our solace in defeat.\r\n\r\nCourage, Comrades--COURAGE! And FORWARD MARCH!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn this mellow, radiant, opulent day of Indian Summer--when the golden\r\nhours step quietly by, leading November into the dim realms which we\r\ncall the Past--I write these lines; and, having done so, cast behind me\r\nthat ugly dream, my New York experience.\r\n\r\nBetrayed, _I will trust again_, AND GO ON. Better ten thousand\r\ntreacheries _than loss of faith_ in my fellow man. Repulsed, I will\r\nrally, re-form, and CHARGE AGAIN. Better a hundred defeats than one\r\ncapitulation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn March 1898, the Populists nominated me for Governor of Georgia. In\r\ndeclining to make the race, my decision was controlled by the fact that\r\nour organization had been wrecked by the Traitors who controlled our\r\nNational Committee, that I myself was exhausted--mentally, physically,\r\nfinancially--and that Populism must henceforth do its work as A LEAVEN\r\nTO THE LOAF.\r\n\r\nThe fatal Fusion of 1896 had done our organization deadly damage, and\r\nthe Spanish War finished us.\r\n\r\nThe blare of the bugle drowned the voice of the Reformer. With the\r\nCannon-boom shaking the world, men had no ear for Political economy--or\r\neconomy of any other sort.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt rushed into war paint, and leaped into fame.\r\n\r\nBryan stuck a feather in his cap, and vowed that he, too, would become a\r\nsoldier in spite of those vile guns.\r\n\r\nHearst, also, went as close to the enemy as McKinley would let him.\r\n\r\nHOW COULD I TALK ECONOMICS WITH ANY PROSPECT OF SUCCESS AT SUCH A TIME?\r\n\r\nLoathing the war, foreseeing many of the evil consequences that it has\r\nbrought upon us, I quit the active agitation of Populism, and shut\r\nmyself up in my library to write books. _But if any soldier of the\r\nSouthern Confederacy carried away from Appomattox a heavier heart than I\r\ntook with me into my enforced retirement_, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MERCIFUL\r\nDISPENSATION OF PROVIDENCE HAD THE ETERNAL SLEEP TAKEN THAT SOLDIER INTO\r\nHER COLD, WHITE ARMS.\r\n\r\nWhat I suffered during those awful years is known to none but the wife\r\nwho shared my lot and the God who gave me strength to endure it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo continue a hopeless fight with a broken-down organization was not the\r\npart of wisdom. The thing to do was to wait, educate the people, let\r\nevents demonstrate that we had been right, and let the Spirit of\r\nPopulism enter into and inspire the leaders of other parties.\r\n\r\nI knew that OUR PRINCIPLES would finally triumph--as to THE PARTY, that\r\nwas a secondary consideration.\r\n\r\nIn taking leave of my comrades in 1898, before quitting the field to go\r\nback into the court-house to earn money to pay pressing debts, here is\r\nwhat my letter said to them:\r\n\r\n“Let no man believe that I despair of your principles, for I do not. You\r\nstand for the yearning, upward-tendency, of the middle and lower\r\nclasses. You stand where the reformer has always stood; for improvement,\r\nfor beneficial changes, for recognition of human brotherhood in its\r\nhighest sense, for equality before the law, and for an industrial system\r\nwhich is not based upon the right of the strong to pillage the weak. You\r\nstand as sworn foes of monopoly--not monopoly in the narrow sense of the\r\nword--but monopoly of power, of place, of privilege, of wealth, of\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n“You stand knocking at the closed door of privilege, as the reformer has\r\never done, and saying to those within, ‘Open wide the doors! Let all who\r\nare worthy, enter. Let all who deserve, enjoy. Form no conspiracy\r\nagainst the unborn. Shut out no generations that are to be. God made it\r\nall for all. Put no barrier around the good things of life, around the\r\nhigh places of church or state. Make no laws which foster inequality.\r\nEstablish no Caste. Legalize no robbery under the name of taxes. Give to\r\nno person natural or artificial sovereign powers over his fellow men.\r\nOpen, open wide the doors! Keep the avenues of honor free. Close no\r\nentrance to the poorest, the weakest, the humblest. Say to ambition\r\neverywhere, the field is clear, the contest fair, come and win your\r\nshare if you can!’\r\n\r\n“Such is Populism. Such is its glorious Gospel. As such, I have loved it\r\nwith boundless reverence. As its disciples, I have loved _you_, fought\r\nfor you, toiled for you, _never for one moment doubting that you were\r\nright_, and that your creed was the same immortal creed which in all\r\nages has challenged wrong, and defied oppression.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTrample the Truth as rudely as you may, even in her death struggle her\r\nvoice is heard to say:\r\n\r\n“I WILL COME AGAIN.”\r\n\r\nIn the darkest hours of the past, when all seemed lost and the\r\nweaklings, the timeservers, the fickle minded and the mercenaries were\r\nfleeing to cover, I used to say, constantly, confidently, “_Courage_,\r\nfriends. Be _firm_. DON’T LOSE HEART. It will all come right.\r\n\r\n“Populism, as a party, may seem to be dead, but the Spirit is immortal.\r\nIt cannot die. As sure as God lives,\r\n\r\n“IT WILL COME AGAIN.”\r\n\r\nAnd now, after many days, in God’s own time, it HAS come again. From the\r\nbottom of my heart and from yours, come _thanks to the Lord of the\r\nUniverse who spared our lives to see this day_.\r\n\r\nAnd the purpose to which every energy I possess shall be devoted,\r\nhenceforth, is TO HELP THOSE WHOM THE PEOPLE COMMISSION TO BRING ABOUT\r\nREFORM.\r\n\r\nAs to Reward, I seek none, expect none, save that of the _Inner Voice_\r\nwhich says,\r\n\r\nWELL DONE.\r\n\r\nWith this glance into the Past, necessary to _you_, as well as to _me_,\r\nlet us turn our backs to it, and face the Future--and let us WORK, as we\r\nnever worked before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “HE CERTAINLY WAS GOOD TO ME.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEditorials.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The New Year]\r\n\r\nLead us gently, Father Time, as you take us to the portals of the New\r\nYear.\r\n\r\nWe know not _what may be within_; and our souls are burdened with fear\r\nas we _stand here at the door_.\r\n\r\nLost, forever lost, is _the Confidence_ with which we _used_ to go\r\nbounding into the New Year--as revellers hasten to the feast.\r\n\r\nWe have met the Unforeseen so often, have mourned where we thought to\r\nrejoice, been trampled upon amid the horrors of panic and defeat where\r\nwe had so stoutly fought for victory and reward, that _our hearts are\r\nsadly subdued_, Father Time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe did not SEEK this awful life-woe, Father Time.\r\n\r\n_Thrust_, from some great outer darkness, into the hurly burly called\r\nLife, we gaze upward at the stars in helpless ignorance of what it all\r\nmay mean; and some Irresistable Force pushes us, _pushes us_, swiftly,\r\n_inexorably_, onward _to another outer_ darkness that _fills us with\r\nspeechless awe_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHave mercy on us, Father Time.

When Mr. Bryan reached the State of Georgia, during his\r\nrecent tour of the South, I wrote him a note which he gave to the press,\r\nand which our readers have doubtless seen.\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards the following personal acknowledgement was received:\r\n\r\n  September 22nd, 1906.\r\n\r\n  Hon. Thos. E. Watson.\r\n\r\n  My Dear Mr. Watson:\r\n\r\n  I received your letter at Augusta and thank you very much for your\r\n  cordial greeting.\r\n\r\n  I am sorry that it was impossible for us to stop over with you. It is\r\n  gratifying to know from what I have learned that we are going to be\r\n  able to act together in the coming contest. There has been a\r\n  remarkable change in public sentiment, so that things that were\r\n  formerly denounced as radical are now regarded as not only quite\r\n  reasonable, but even necessary. If you come our way, we shall be glad\r\n  again to see you, only hoping that you may have more time than when\r\n  you last visited us. Mrs. Bryan joins me in best wishes.\r\n\r\n  Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n  W. J. BRYAN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Bryan says: “_It is gratifying to know from what I have learned\r\nthat we are going to be able to act together in the coming contest._”\r\n\r\nNothing would give me greater pleasure than to see the National\r\nDemocratic party undergo a general casting out of the unclean spirits\r\nthat have taken possession of it. If it should become truly Democratic,\r\nif it should return to the principles of the fathers, if it should\r\nrenounce Hamilton and all his works, if it should rebaptize itself in\r\nthe creed of Jefferson, if its National organization should expel every\r\ntool of the Trusts, every agent of Wall street, every beneficiary of\r\nspecial Privilege--_then the Democratic party would stand for\r\nsubstantially the same things as The People’s Party_.\r\n\r\nThat being so, why should we not be able “to act together?”\r\n\r\nParty _names_ are nothing. _Principles_ are everything. True reformers\r\nthink more of _having the work done_ than of _getting the credit_. Many\r\nPopulists condemned me in 1905 for advising them to support Hoke Smith\r\nfor Governor of Georgia. _No Populist condemns me now._ EVERYBODY\r\nREALIZES THAT THERE ARE MORE POPULISTS IN GEORGIA TODAY THAN THERE EVER\r\nWERE BEFORE.\r\n\r\nRead once more the strong, manly letter which Hoke Smith wrote for the\r\nfirst issue of the Weekly Jeffersonian, and then remember that thirteen\r\nyears ago the writer was a member of Cleveland’s Cabinet--_then_ you\r\nwill realize how immensely _the man has grown_.\r\n\r\nWell, his Democratic followers have grown with him, and we Jeffersonians\r\nvastly outnumber the moss-backs throughout the State of Georgia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Bryan says, _a great change is coming over the people_. Doctrines\r\nwhich were scouted a few years ago are shouted now. Radicals who were\r\nhooted, howled down and rotten-egged a few years ago are getting\r\nbouquets now. _The Hearst editorials and speeches read like Populist\r\nharangues of 1892._ THE BRYAN PLATFORM OF 1906 EMBRACES WHAT WAS\r\nCONSIDERED THE WILDEST PLANK OF THE PEOPLE’S PARTY PLATFORM OF 1891.\r\n\r\n“Act together,” William? Why not--_if you take our principles for your\r\ncreed and reorganize your old party to fit your new faith?_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat all true reformers may find a way to “act together” is a\r\nconsummation devoutly to be wished. A conference between Bryan, Hearst\r\nand myself for that purpose was suggested immediately after the election\r\nof 1904, but neither Mr. Bryan nor Mr. Hearst seemed to approve.\r\n\r\nWhat may happen between now and 1908 no one can foretell, but I am\r\n_still hoping that some honorable plan may be hit upon which will enable\r\nall true-hearted reformers to_ “_act_ TOGETHER” _and overthrow this\r\nfearful system which enables the privileged few to plunder the\r\nunprivileged many_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSocialism at War with Love of Home and Country.\r\n\r\nIn a recent issue of a leading Socialist paper the following gem of\r\nthought is to be found:\r\n\r\n“‘PATRIOTISM’ _is a nickname for_ ‘PREJUDICE.’”\r\n\r\nDo you know why the Socialist flouts _patriotism_ and calls it\r\n_prejudice_?\r\n\r\nThink a little, and you will see. You love your _country_ because your\r\n_home_ is a part of it; and you love your _home_ because it is _your\r\nindividual haven of refuge from the storms of life_--the individual\r\nkingdom in which you are lord and master and in which you enjoy, with\r\nyour wife, your children, and your friends, whatever happiness life can\r\ngive.\r\n\r\n_The man never lived who would_ NOT _fight for his home_--HOWEVER\r\nHUMBLE.\r\n\r\nThe man never lived who _would_ fight for the tenement house in which he\r\nchances to be a lodger. THE HOME IS EVER SACRED--the _hotel_ never is.\r\nThe reason is plain enough. The home is yours, _individually_; the hotel\r\nis everybody’s _generally_. Now, the Socialist strikes at\r\n_individualism_. He doesn’t want to own your home by any title that\r\ngives you individual control of it. _He wants everybody’s home to belong\r\nto you, and your home to belong to everybody._ In other words, the homes\r\nof the people are to be owned collectively. If society sees fit to say\r\nto you “MOVE ON,” out you go. Society will substitute _its_ title for\r\n_your_ title, _its_ will for _your_ will, _its_ control for _your_\r\ncontrol. The home that Socialism will permit you to use this year may be\r\nallotted to some one else another year.\r\n\r\n_Under these conditions no man would love his home any more than he\r\nwould love his room in a hotel._ Under these conditions, the citizen\r\nwould have _no greater inducement to make permanent improvements upon\r\nhis home, than he would have to make improvements upon the hotel_.\r\n\r\nLove of home being destroyed, love of country would also be destroyed.\r\nPatriotism, being founded upon love of home, would perish under\r\nSocialism, for the simple reason that the foundations would be gone.\r\n_Under Socialism, the most beautiful feature of civilized life would\r\ndisappear._ Home life, as we know it, would be impossible. The song of\r\n“Home, Sweet Home,” would thrill no responsive chords in the human\r\nheart. The tender pathos of Burns’ “Cotter’s Saturday Night,” would not\r\nbe felt. Socialism would answer with a universal YES, Sir Walter Scott’s\r\nringing challenge,\r\n\r\n  “Lives there A MAN WITH SOUL SO DEAD,\r\n   Who never to himself hath said,\r\n     THIS IS MY OWN, MY NATIVE LAND?”\r\n\r\n\r\nNational Finance Run Mad.\r\n\r\nTHE WASHINGTON POST is authority for the statement that the President\r\nwill, in his next Message, _again_ urge upon Congress the necessity for\r\nCurrency Reform.\r\n\r\nThe MONEY QUESTION, as you will remember IS SETTLED; it is only THE\r\nCURRENCY that needs REFORM.\r\n\r\nBryan says THE MONEY QUESTION IS SETTLED; ditto Roosevelt; ditto\r\nSecretary Shaw; _ditto the big bugs of_ BOTH _the dear old political\r\nparties_.\r\n\r\nYet, with equal unanimity and fervor, they all say that THE NEED OF\r\nCURRENCY REFORM is something fierce.\r\n\r\nPeculiar, isn’t it?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen _the people_ want financial legislation that will _restore the\r\nsystem of The Fathers_, it is THE MONEY QUESTION, and it’s SETTLED. The\r\nold party leaders, one and all, agree upon THAT.\r\n\r\nPolitically, therefore, THAT question is RES ADJUDICATA, and must not be\r\nspoken of any more.\r\n\r\nBut when _the corporations_ want financial legislation _which will tend\r\nstill further to make our National Treasury a huge Reservoir from which\r\nthe National Banks and their allies can draw strength, support and\r\nprofit_--why, THEN, it is a matter of CURRENCY REFORM, and if Congress\r\ndoesn’t give the Money Power everything it demands, the Country will go\r\nto the “demnition bow-wows.”\r\n\r\nThat’s how it is, my son.\r\n\r\nTHE MOGULS OF HIGH FINANCE declare that what our currency system needs\r\nis greater “_elasticity_.” The India rubber quality is wanting, it\r\nseems. The present system doesn’t _stretch_ readily enough. The Moguls\r\ndeclare that the “_rigidity_” of the currency system threatens us with\r\ncalamitous conditions at the prospect of which the imagination becomes\r\nexhausted and quits business.\r\n\r\nThose two words, “_elasticity_” and “_rigidity_” are being featured in\r\nall the Mogul talk, all the Mogul papers--and are being dutifully\r\nrepeated by all the Mogul Senators and Representatives.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYET, THERE ISN’T A PARTICLE OF SOUND COMMON SENSE in all this cant about\r\n_elasticity_ and _rigidity_.\r\n\r\nWhen the currency system of the body-politic is healthy and normal,\r\nthere can be no question of elasticity and rigidity. Like the\r\ncirculation of the blood in the human body, the circulation of money\r\nwill take care of itself.\r\n\r\nONCE GET THE SYSTEM RIGHT, AND NATURE WILL DO THE REST.\r\n\r\nIf the Physician tells you that YOUR CIRCULATION IS BAD--you KNOW what\r\nthat means.\r\n\r\nYour system is out of order. The blood goes about its business, without\r\nany help from YOU, PROVIDED YOUR SYSTEM IS KEPT IN ORDER.\r\n\r\nYOU don’t have to pump blood away from center to the extremities; THE\r\nBLOOD WILL GO THERE, OF ITSELF, IF YOUR BODILY SYSTEM IS IN THE PROPER,\r\nNORMAL, SOUND CONDITION.\r\n\r\nIt is just so with, the circulation of money in the body politic; if the\r\nsystem is RIGHT, THE MONEY CIRCULATION WILL REGULATE ITSELF BY NATURAL\r\nLAWS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nELASTICITY--RIGIDITY--two words that are cunningly employed to disguise\r\nthe purpose of the Moguls of National finance. _Those conspirators mean\r\nto drive the Government still further away from the Constitutional\r\nsystem of the Fathers._ They mean to push still further _the usurped\r\npower of the National Banks to create and control the supply and\r\ndistribution of the Currency_.\r\n\r\n“Currency Reform” means nothing more nor less than that.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT LOANS TO THE COMMON PEOPLE, at four per cent, or even at two\r\nper cent, would seem to be _more statesmanlike_, in all respects, than\r\n_this eternal lending of government money to Wall Street without any\r\ninterest at all_.\r\n\r\nWHY SHOULD UNCLE SAM FURNISH GAMBLERS MONEY TO SPECULATE WITH? Can any\r\ngood reason be given for it? Does it seem to be fair to legitimate\r\nbusiness men? Is it just to the taxpayers? Can it be RIGHT?\r\n\r\nYet the Wall Street gamblers got nearly ($30,000,000) thirty million\r\ndollars from the U. S. Treasury in one lump. Upon this huge sum of\r\npublic money, the speculators will pay no interest at all.\r\n\r\nIs it right?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL STATEMENT for Nov. 12th, 1906, THE GOVERNMENT\r\nhas now increased ITS LOANS TO THE NATIONAL BANKS to the stupendous\r\nTOTAL of $147,000,000.\r\n\r\nNever before has the gratuitous loan been so large. Who can defend such\r\na policy? Who would not BE ASHAMED to appear before an audience of\r\nintelligent voters to advocate the wisdom and the propriety of such\r\nGOVERNMENTAL FAVORITISM as this?\r\n\r\nYou laughed at the Farmers’ Alliance when it favored government loans to\r\nthe people, on the best of security, at two per cent interest. Yet you\r\nsay _nothing_ against government _loans to a few pet National Banks_\r\nFREE OF INTEREST, and upon DOUBTFUL SECURITY.\r\n\r\nPart of that LOAN OF ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY-SEVEN MILLIONS is secured by\r\nChicago Municipal Bonds, called, I believe, the Sanitary Bonds. Would\r\nyou not prefer to lend YOUR Money upon a good farm, or _upon warehouse\r\ncertificates for cotton_?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE FARMERS would be only too glad to pay the Government FOUR PER CENT\r\nfor that money which THE PET BANKS GET FOR NOTHING. Four per cent\r\ninterest upon one hundred and forty-seven million dollars is a tidy sum.\r\nFigure it out and you will see, that it is about SIX MILLION DOLLARS.\r\nThat’s a neat sum to be GIVEN AWAY EVERY YEAR, isn’t it?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCONSIDER THIS ALSO: You, the Common People, are the taxpayers who put\r\nthat money into the U. S. Treasury. THE PET NATIONAL BANKS PAY,\r\nPRACTICALLY, NONE OF IT.\r\n\r\nYet THEY have the use of YOUR money FREE. If YOU get the use of a dollar\r\nof it, YOU MUST GO TO THEM FOR TERMS.\r\n\r\n_Tough_, isn’t it?\r\n\r\nNO WONDER THE MONEY SUPPLY IS CONGESTED. So long as the Government TAXES\r\nIT OUT OF THE POCKETS OF THE MANY, and delivers it over TO THE FEW,\r\nthere is _bound_ to be congestion.\r\n\r\nYet, the Pet National Banks are moving heaven and earth, RIGHT NOW, to\r\nhave CONGRESS LEGISLATE IN FAVOR OF GREATER CONGESTION. The power of the\r\nFew over the Many must be increased by additional legislation.\r\nOtherwise, the bottom will drop out and Perdition will have us by the\r\nnape of the neck. When eminently respectable cabinet officers,\r\ncongressmen, editors, etc., tell you that THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF RUNNING\r\nTHE FINANCES IN FAVOR OF WALL STREET SPECULATORS AND PET BANKS is safe\r\nand sane, and that all we need is to make it a little more so, BELIEVE\r\nEVERY WORD OF IT AND VOTE ACCORDINGLY.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, when some discredited crank tells you that _it is an\r\ninfernal shame_ to use the law-making machinery in that manner, _howl\r\nhim down_, at once.\r\n\r\nDON’T LEND TO THE TAXPAYER HIS OWN MONEY AT FOUR PER CENT. THAT’S\r\nPATERNALISM--and it STINKS.\r\n\r\nTake the taxpayers’ money and LEND IT TO THE PET BANKS without any\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nTHAT’S STATESMANSHIP--and it SMELLS LIKE ATTAR OF ROSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to Hearst.\r\n\r\nThe case against Plutocracy gained an advance upon the Docket by the New\r\nYork gubernatorial contest, but, unless I am much mistaken, two national\r\nfigures came out of it with mud on their boots.\r\n\r\nOne of these is W. R. Hearst.\r\n\r\nThe other is W. J. Bryan.\r\n\r\nWhen Max Ihmsen advised Mr. Hearst to come to terms with Murphy, the\r\nstriped Tammany Boss, he disgusted thousands of sincere Hearstites, not\r\nonly in New York but throughout the Union.\r\n\r\nThe deal was _too_ bad.\r\n\r\nIt took Hearst out of the class of Reformers and put him into that of\r\nself-seeking Politicians.\r\n\r\nIt created in the minds of his disinterested friends the suspicion that\r\nhe posed as a Reformer to serve the purpose of a personal ambition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBoss Murphy is a rich specimen of the Boss--the man who is in politics\r\nfor Money, who cares nothing for Principle, who has no conception of\r\nDuty, who would not understand what you meant if you talked to him about\r\nMoral Obligation, who amasses wealth by screening from adverse\r\nlegislation the rascals that rob the Public under corporate names, who\r\nmakes it possible for invaluable public franchises to be stolen with\r\nimpunity, and who renders it easy for the robbers that grabbed the\r\nproperty to use it to oppress and exploit the people from whom it was\r\nstolen.\r\n\r\nI _know_ that Murphy is the worst representative of _that class of\r\nBosses_ because the Hearst newspapers told me so.\r\n\r\nI _know_ that he has used his power, as Tammany Chief, to protect such\r\nrobbers of the Public as Belmont, Morgan, Rogers and Ryan, because Mr.\r\nHearst has told me so with “damnable iteration” and convincing emphasis\r\nthese many years.\r\n\r\nAt the breakfast table, he reminded me of it in his morning paper, _The\r\nAmerican_.\r\n\r\nAt the supper table, he recalled the fact to my memory in his evening\r\npaper, _The Journal_.\r\n\r\nIn fact, he gave me no chance to forget it.\r\n\r\nMurphy, a protector of Crime, Murphy, a tool of the Plunderbund; Murphy,\r\nthe stuffer of ballot-boxes; Murphy, the ally of Murderers and thieves;\r\nMurphy, the inciter to assassination; Murphy, who robbed New York in the\r\ninterest of Ryan and Belmont; Murphy, who ought to be in the\r\nPenitentiary garbed in convict stripes--THIS Murphy became so familiar\r\nto me in the Hearst newspapers that I would have felt the loss of\r\nsomething habitual, and therefore necessary, had my friend Hearst ceased\r\nto grind the coffee-mill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DREAMING OF 1908.]\r\n\r\nYet Max Ihmsen deliberately planned a coalition between denouncer and\r\ndenounced, between the Angel of Reform and the Devil of Plutocracy,\r\nbetween the Champion of the “Common People” and the hireling of the\r\nPlunderbund, between the man who cried “Stop thief” and the rogue who\r\nwas making off with the stolen goods.\r\n\r\nIT WAS TOO BAD.\r\n\r\nIt shocked the _Sense of Right_ of ten thousands of enthusiastic\r\nHearstites who had believed in him as an _honest_ leader.  *  *  *\r\n\r\nSee _the Consequences_ of this foul and fatal deal:\r\n\r\nFirst--the loss of that most valuable asset, the real reformers of The\r\nIndependence League;\r\n\r\nSecond--the revulsion of feeling among disinterested Democrats and\r\nRepublicans who were supporting Hearst _on principle_;\r\n\r\nThird--the calling back to robust life of the almost defunct Boss,\r\nMurphy;\r\n\r\nFourth--the complete rehabilitation of Tammany;\r\n\r\nFifth--the surrender to the Plunderbund of the State Supreme Court _for\r\nfourteen years_;\r\n\r\nSixth--the restoration to his place of power and hurtfulness of Thomas\r\nGrady, the most debauched legislative corruptionist in America.\r\n\r\nI _know_ that Grady is that kind of man, because the Hearst papers have\r\nassured me of it so often that no doubt upon the subject disturbs the\r\nabsolute serenity of my fixed opinion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs these _net results_ of the New York election loom up clearly above\r\nthe dust and noise of the conflict, it is natural that Mr. Hearst will\r\nbe seen to have dimmed his halo very considerably; and _the fact that\r\nMurphy_, after securing to himself and his gang all the benefits of the\r\ncoalition, _turned upon Hearst at the last moment and put the knife into\r\nhim_, will cause no tears ANYWHERE.\r\n\r\nThat’s just what Hearst ought to have known would happen--for he had\r\nsaid things about Murphy which _no man_, born of woman, _could possibly\r\nforgive_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut Bryan put a shadow upon _his_ radiance, also.\r\n\r\nHe swallowed the Hearst programme all the way through--from soup and\r\nfish to cheese and coffee. _His stomach balked at nothing._ The ousting\r\nof Democratic delegations which had been elected to the Buffalo\r\nConvention; the packing of that Convention with delegations which had\r\nnot been elected; the throw down of The Independence League; the\r\nguillotining of the Independent candidates; the repudiation of the\r\nhonest labor-champion, Thomas Rock, and the endorsement of the\r\nPlunderbund corruptionist, Thomas Grady; the fix-up of the Judiciary\r\nticket in which three Judges were allotted to Hearst while Murphy calmly\r\npocketed seven--Bryan’s gorge rose at none of these things. One and all,\r\nthey slid down his gullet like rain-water down a tin valley.\r\n\r\nJust think if it!\r\n\r\nIn 1904, Bryan was making 60 speeches a day for Parker--Judge Alton B.\r\nParker--whom he described as “the Moses of Democracy.”\r\n\r\nIn 1906, he was writing, telegraphing, telephoning and so forth for W.\r\nR. Hearst, _the exact_ CONTRAST _to Parker_.\r\n\r\nHeavens, what a leap!\r\n\r\nFrom Parker to Hearst--from Greenland’s icy mountains to India’s coral\r\nstrand.\r\n\r\nNEVER saw such a jump before in my life.\r\n\r\nAnd Bryan is going to find that it will require considerable dexterity\r\nto fit his crown on straight, after _that_ trouser-splitting leap.\r\n\r\nHEARST has not changed _in principle_; PARKER has not changed _in\r\nprinciple_; yet within two short years MR. BRYAN _has advocated_ EACH OF\r\nTHEM _with equal fervor_.\r\n\r\nQuit playing Politician, William, or you will do yourself irreparable\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\n_Fly your flag_ AS REFORMER and hold your sword _straight before you_.\r\n\r\nDon’t again call such a man as Parker “the Moses of Democracy.”\r\n\r\nDon’t endorse Hearst, _when he is_ WRONG!\r\n\r\n_Condemn the wrong_, and thus encourage Hearst to mend his ways, to\r\nretire Max Ihmsen, and THUS MAKE his powerful newspapers, MORE USEFUL,\r\nMORE EFFECTIVE IN THE GRAND CAUSE OF REFORM.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrnamental Flag Poles--Eastern Insurance Companies.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania politicians decided that the state needed a new\r\nCapitol. The people were told that unless a better state house were\r\nerected Pennsylvania would be pointed at with scorn, viewed with alarm,\r\nand otherwise treated in a disrespectful and uncomfortable manner.\r\n\r\nSo, the politicians, contractors, material men, jobbers, lobbyists,\r\ndead-beats, plain thieves and so forth, went forward and in due time a\r\nnew capitol for Pennsylvania was evolved.\r\n\r\nCosting how much?\r\n\r\nTHIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS, MY SON.\r\n\r\nThe house, itself, cost only $4,000,000.\r\n\r\nBut, then, you see, it had to be furnished.\r\n\r\nThe “furnishings” of the new state house cost the tax payers of\r\nPennsylvania $9,000,000.\r\n\r\nAs a sample of said furnishings, consider the one item of flag staff.\r\n\r\nWhat would such a magnificent new capitol be without a flag flying above\r\nit?\r\n\r\n_Of course_, the state house must be surmounted by the flag.\r\n\r\nAnd how can the flag do itself credit, away up there in the heavens,\r\nwithout a pole to fly from?\r\n\r\n_Of course_, there must be a flag pole.\r\n\r\nSo, the pole was put in place, and the flag was braced to the pole.\r\n\r\nAt what cost, please?\r\n\r\nWhy, the flag pole cost $850. Not $8.50, but $850.\r\n\r\nSo, at least, it appears upon the expense-account.\r\n\r\nWhat was the flag pole made of?\r\n\r\nWhy, _it was just the round body of a large pine tree_.\r\n\r\nNothing else, my son.\r\n\r\nThe probability is that any sawmill in the country would have furnished\r\nsuch a tree for $25.\r\n\r\nThe labor of preparing the tree for use as a flag pole might have cost\r\nanother $25.\r\n\r\nFifty dollars ought to have covered the entire cost.\r\n\r\nBut then, you see, the gang that was bossing the job needed money;\r\ntherefore, the State of Pennsylvania was supplied with a fifty-dollar\r\nflag pole for the moderate sum of $850.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the country is adorned with numerous _other flag poles of the same\r\nvariety_.\r\n\r\nOne of them is PAUL MORTON, President of THE EQUITABLE ASSURANCE\r\nSOCIETY.\r\n\r\nNo institution in this land of the free has a flag pole that is more\r\nexpensive.\r\n\r\nPaul Morton costs the policy holders of the Equitable $80,000 per year.\r\nNot $8,000--which would be a fair price--but $80,000--which is a gouge.\r\n\r\nJust how many men, equally capable, could be found to fill his place at\r\n$10,000 per year, it would be impossible to say; but there is no doubt\r\nwhatever that Paul himself would have served the Society just as well\r\nupon a salary of $25,000.\r\n\r\nBut then, you see, he wanted more. So he took it.\r\n\r\nFlag poles come high--under certain circumstances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLife Insurance, properly done, is of vast benefit to the Insured. Life\r\nInsurance, improperly done, is of vast benefit,--to the Insurer. Those\r\nEastern Companies got too gay. Their higher officers became corrupt.\r\nUnder various flimsy pretexts, they began to plunder the Insured. _Local\r\nagents, who did the hard work, got small pay._ State agents and National\r\nofficers drew princely salaries,--and did little to show for it.\r\n\r\nSome of those Eastern Companies have been building Insurance Business on\r\nthe same principle that gave an exhibition of itself in the building of\r\nthe new State House of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows that the taxpayers of Pennsylvania have been robbed.\r\nEverybody knows, equally well, that the Policy-holders of those Eastern\r\nCompanies have been plundered.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of such rascals as the McCurdy gang, the\r\nPolicy-holder resembled an Irish potato, in that _he had eyes yet saw\r\nnot_.\r\n\r\nThe blind Policy-holder, _who could never see that he was being robbed_,\r\nbecame a jest among the thieves who spent his money in riotous living.\r\n\r\nLife Insurance is all right--_when the Insurer is_.\r\n\r\nBEFORE you allow the Insurance Company to examine YOU, _examine the\r\nInsurance Company_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln’s Silly Biographers.\r\n\r\nThe process of making a saint out of Abraham Lincoln goes bravely on.\r\nHis latest biographer, Mr. Hill, clears him of the charge of “telling\r\nstories just to amuse people.” Mr. Hill--a sober and worthy man, no\r\ndoubt--produces a witness by the name of Ewing, who being duly sworn,\r\ndeposes and says:\r\n\r\n“I never heard Mr. Lincoln tell a story for its own sake or simply to\r\nraise a laugh. He used stories to illustrate a point, but the idea that\r\nhe sat around and matched yarns like a commercial traveller is utterly\r\nfalse.”\r\n\r\nWhy should the Lincoln biographers strive and strain to establish the\r\nfact that HE NEVER “SAT AROUND AND MATCHED YARNS LIKE A COMMERCIAL\r\nTRAVELLER?”\r\n\r\nIs it any disgrace to sit around, occasionally, and swap yarns, “like a\r\ncommercial traveller?”\r\n\r\nIf so, the men who are TRULY RESPECTABLE are the dull fellows who can\r\nneither tell a joke, nor enjoy one. Some of the best and brightest men\r\nthat ever lived have prided themselves upon their gifts in that very\r\nline. To be a good story-teller is to possess the golden key that\r\nunlocks almost every social door.\r\n\r\nDaniel Webster revelled in a good story; so did Clay; so did Tom Corwin;\r\nso did Robert Toombs, and Alexander H. Stephens.\r\n\r\nAs a mental relaxation and recreation, there are, in fact, few things\r\nthat serve better than “to sit around and match yarns like a commercial\r\ntraveller.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT LINCOLN is that he was a man, and _a great man, but no\r\nsaint_.\r\n\r\nThe last time I was in New York (November, 1905), my friend, Hon. T. H.\r\nTibbles, of Nebraska, was there, also, and we talked of Lincoln, whom\r\nMr. Tibbles had known.\r\n\r\nAnd _one of the very things which Mr. Tibbles had seen and heard Mr.\r\nLincoln do was “to sit around and match yarns like a commercial\r\ntraveller.”_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. TIBBLES TOLD ME how, being at a certain place, his attention was\r\nattracted by repeated bursts of loud laughter, coming from a certain\r\nroom. His youthful curiosity being excited, he followed the sound to the\r\nroom from which it came. The sight that met his eyes was this: Abraham\r\nLincoln was sitting in a chair, with his big feet upon a table in front\r\nof him; around him were grouped a number of men, to whom Mr. Lincoln was\r\ntelling side-splitting yarns.\r\n\r\nTibbles joined the audience and got his share of the fun.\r\n\r\nWhat of it?\r\n\r\nDoes that lower Lincoln in any sensible man’s eyes?\r\n\r\nNo. Let the Miss Nancy brigade go off to one side and talk about the\r\nnebular hypothesis, or some other nice, well-bred subject. For my part,\r\nI would prefer, _occasionally_, “to sit around and match yarns like a\r\ncommercial traveller.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI asked Mr. Tibbles whether the stories that he heard Mr. Lincoln\r\ntelling were smutty.\r\n\r\nAt some future time, when I find, after a careful field-glass scrutiny\r\nof the horizon, that I have no other row on hand, and am feeling the\r\nneed of one _very_ badly, _I am going to tell you Tibbles’ answer_.\r\n\r\n\r\nShoot, Luke, or Give Up the Gun.\r\n\r\nMost men are presumed to have sense enough to know when the sun is up,\r\nand when it is down.\r\n\r\nTo no mortal on this earth is it a matter of vital importance to know\r\nthe exact moment it rises and sets.\r\n\r\nEven if any inquisitive lunatic wanted to know, he couldn’t find out,\r\nfor the simple reason that the hour of sunrise and sunset varies with\r\nevery mile of the earth’s surface, and is earlier to the man at the foot\r\nof the mountain than to the man on top.\r\n\r\nIn the military establishments of the world, however, it is considered\r\nto be a matter of life and death to know just when the sun rises and\r\njust when he sets. So extremely indispensable is this piece of daily\r\ninformation that a gun, a cannon we mean, _must_ be fired to proclaim\r\nthe tidings.\r\n\r\n“Boom!”--the sun is up.\r\n\r\n“Boom!”--he’s down.\r\n\r\nWhereupon, your true soldier can sleep with a conscience childlike in\r\nits freedom from care.\r\n\r\nOtherwise not.\r\n\r\nIf that gun (mind you, a _cannon_) was _not_ fired, solemnly and\r\nformally fired, every time the sun rose and every time he set, the\r\nmilitary breast would be racked with rude alarms, and the military mind\r\nwould be tossed to and fro with dread forebodings.\r\n\r\nTo fire off a musket wouldn’t do; wouldn’t _begin_ to do.\r\n\r\nIt would be unconstitutional, if not actually anarchistic and\r\nrevolutionary.\r\n\r\nTo start the day without firing a cannon--why the military establishment\r\ncould no more perform its traditionary functions without a cannon salute\r\nto the coming and going of the sun than one of the old parties could\r\nexist without stuffed ballot boxes.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the custom is fixed--rooted, as it were, in the soil of our\r\ncivilization. It is one of the greatest advantages we have over our\r\nuntutored ancestors.\r\n\r\nHowever much _they_ may have yearned to shoot the sun up and shoot it\r\ndown, they couldn’t do it. They had nothing to shoot with. They were so\r\ncompletely engulfed in the currents of stupidity and barbarism that they\r\njust had to trust to their eyes to know when the sun was up, or was\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nYou might ask how the soldiers do _on cloudy days_. You might ask, with\r\nunseasonable levity, if the army doesn’t have to go by the clock _when\r\nthe sun is not to be seen_. And you might, out of your desire to be\r\nsmart and show yourself off, ask whether the army couldn’t go by the\r\nclock as well on fair days as on foul ones.\r\n\r\nBut such questions as these will do you no good, and they would cause\r\nyou to lose friends. They are irrelevant impertinences.\r\n\r\nFor, you see, when anything has been done a long time, the presumption\r\nis that there is sense in doing it that way.\r\n\r\nTherefore, all nice and respectable people put salt in the fire when the\r\nscreech owl twitters, and make a cross mark and spit in it, whenever\r\nthey turn back in their tracks. We all do this because the custom has\r\nage and good sense on its side.\r\n\r\nIf you think you can prance through the world smashing steady old\r\ncustoms which have been handed down to us from time immemorial, you are\r\nin a fair way to get yourself into trouble.\r\n\r\nConsequently, if you don’t like the way the armies of the world spend\r\nthe people’s money shooting for the sun, you had just as well make up\r\nyour mind to the wisdom of laying low, and paying your share of the\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\nEvery two years, your chosen representatives in Congress approve the\r\nitem in the Military Appropriation Bill which gives $20,600 to the army\r\nto shoot the sun-shoots with.\r\n\r\nNow, if you don’t like it what are you going to do about it?\r\n\r\nThe soldiers are not going to go by clocks or by eyes--they are going to\r\nshoot those cannon, at all the military posts, every time the sun rises\r\nand every time he sets.\r\n\r\nAnd you will continue to pay the expenses, as formerly.\r\n\r\nWhat else are you here for?\r\n\r\n“Boom!”--the sun’s up.\r\n\r\n“Boom!”--he’s down.\r\n\r\nAnd it only costs $20,600.\r\n\r\nSee how great a thing it is to be civilized.\r\n\r\nWe shouldn’t be surprised if the sun had lots of amusement watching us\r\nfools down here.\r\n\r\nBOOM!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dismissal of Those Negro Troops.\r\n\r\nWhat else could the President have done?\r\n\r\nHe is Commander-in-Chief of the Army: certain members of a certain\r\nbattalion “shoot up” a certain town destroying property, terrorizing a\r\npeaceful community and committing murder.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief endeavors to discover the identity of the guilty\r\nparties. He fails. He then _appeals to the honor of the battalion_,\r\nasking that the innocent point out the guilty. By no other method can\r\nthe red-handed rioters and murderers be identified and brought to\r\nJustice.\r\n\r\n_The battalion is deaf to the appeal._\r\n\r\nThe innocent refuse to point out the guilty.\r\n\r\n_The innocent elect to make a common cause with the guilty._\r\n\r\nTherefore, THEY, THEMSELVES, BECOME GUILTY of the highest crimes, as\r\nACCESSORIES AFTER THE FACT.\r\n\r\nIn law and morals, there is _not an innocent man left in that\r\nbattalion_, whose every member deliberately conceals the murderers, aids\r\nand abets them after full knowledge of the crime.\r\n\r\nConsidering them all as guilty, the President ordered their dishonorable\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\n_Why not?_\r\n\r\nThey had committed crimes involving turpitude, degrading the uniform.\r\n\r\nThey had sullenly defied the President’s appeal to their honor, and\r\nhence his notice to disband them.\r\n\r\nThe innocent had elected to share the guilt of the guilty, and thus _the\r\nwhole battalion was guilty_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFanatical friends of the blacks say that the President _should not have\r\npunished the innocent_.\r\n\r\nNor did he.\r\n\r\nHe who conceals a murderer giving him aid and comfort, is himself a\r\nparty to the crime.\r\n\r\nWhat legal principle is older and sounder than that?\r\n\r\nThe fanatics overlook it.\r\n\r\nThe President did not.\r\n\r\nNor will those who consider the facts without passion and seek to judge\r\nthe case without prejudice.\r\n\r\nApparently, the fanatics intend to convulse the Congress and the country\r\nover this matter of the Negro Troops.\r\n\r\nLet it not be forgotten that _even now the fanatics do not propose that\r\nthe originally innocent negroes shall be required to point out those\r\noriginally guilty_.\r\n\r\nThe fanatics demand that the President back down, and that the order for\r\nthe dismissal of the negroes be countermanded.\r\n\r\nThus, the originally guilty will be forever screened, and the crimes\r\nthey committed will forever go unwhipt of Justice.\r\n\r\nThe President has been right and should be sustained.\r\n\r\nTo allow these fanatics and these negroes to triumph over the President,\r\nWOULD BE TO EXALT THE CRIMINAL AND TO DEGRADE THE JUST JUDGE.\r\n\r\nIf that had been a battalion of white men, nothing would have been said\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nBut it was a lot of negroes--consequently the fanatics got busy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Proposed Ship Subsidy\r\n\r\nA FAT MAN who was talking loud enough to disturb his fellow-passengers\r\non the train, said:\r\n\r\n“What we need now is the Ship Subsidy, and the Panama Canal and”--the\r\nrest was of the same sort. He had read something like this in a\r\nnewspaper, and had SEEN IT THERE SO OFTEN that he had come to the\r\nconclusion it must necessarily be true.\r\n\r\nIN THIS WAY SOME MEN GET WHAT THEY CALL THEIR OPINIONS.\r\n\r\nNot YOU, of course. You get yours BY THINKING FOR YOURSELF. I KNOW that\r\nthis is so, because YOU TOLD ME SO YOURSELF.\r\n\r\n“We need a Ship Subsidy,” declared the fat man, with emphasis and\r\ndecision. So “WE” do--but who are the “WE?”\r\n\r\nThe WE who need a Ship Subsidy are the Privileged, the beneficiaries of\r\nClass Legislation, the Trusts which gorge themselves upon unjust\r\nadvantages.\r\n\r\nIn order that we may enable the Manufacturing Class _to enjoy a\r\nMonopoly at home while they undersell the foreign Manufacturer in the\r\nforeign market_, we have put a fictitious, UNNATURAL VALUE TO THE\r\nMATERIALS OUT OF WHICH SHIPS ARE BUILT.\r\n\r\nConsequently it costs MORE to build a ship in the United States than\r\nanywhere else in the world.\r\n\r\nNow, our Navigation laws will not allow the national flag to protect an\r\nAmerican vessel UNLESS THAT VESSEL IS BUILT IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nRESULT:\r\n\r\nThe foreigner has come WITH HIS CHEAPER VESSEL and borne off our\r\ncarrying trade.\r\n\r\nOur infernal Tariff and Navigation laws have driven our flag from the\r\nseas, by making it IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE AMERICAN MERCHANT TO BUY HIS SHIP\r\nABROAD, OR TO BUILD ONE AT HOME ON SUCH TERMS AS WILL ENABLE HIM TO\r\nCOMPETE WITH THE FOREIGN-BUILT SHIP.\r\n\r\nIsn’t that plain enough, WHEN YOU STOP TO THINK IT OVER?\r\n\r\nBUT THE FAT MAN declared that what WE need is the Ship Subsidy Bill.\r\n\r\nWhat IS the Ship Subsidy Bill?\r\n\r\nWhy, it is a proposition that the Government shall, in effect, take\r\nmoney out of the National Treasury TO MAKE GOOD TO THE SEA MERCHANT THE\r\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FOREIGN AND HOME PRICE OF THE SHIP.\r\n\r\nThat’s the GIST of it, my son.\r\n\r\nAT YOUR EXPENSE, the government has created the Trust which makes it\r\n_impossible for an American to build a ship that can compete for\r\nocean-going freight_.\r\n\r\nAT YOUR EXPENSE, that impossibility is to be abolished. THE DIFFERENCE\r\nIN PRICE between the cheap foreign-built ship and the dear home-built\r\nship IS TO BE MADE UP OUT OF YOUR MONEY.\r\n\r\nAT YOUR EXPENSE, the Trust will therefore be ABLE TO COMPETE for the\r\nocean business.\r\n\r\nAT YOUR EXPENSE, the Trusts themselves will scoop the Carriers’ profit\r\nupon the transportation of the Trust-made goods which ARE SOLD ABROAD\r\nCHEAPER THAN THEY ARE SOLD AT HOME.\r\n\r\nYou catch it all around, don’t you, son?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYES, THE FAT MAN was right.\r\n\r\nWe DO need a Ship Subsidy--we Trusts.\r\n\r\nWe want to maintain our monopoly at home, and we will do it. We want to\r\ncontinue to undersell the foreigner in the market and we will do it. We\r\nwant, furthermore, to rake into our own coffers the profits now reaped\r\nby the foreigner who controls ocean transportation.\r\n\r\nWe COULD do this _by lowering the Tariff_, but that would derange our\r\nentire Class-law fabric. THAT WOULD ENDANGER OUR MONOPOLY OF THE HOME\r\nMARKET.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the only way for us to get what WE want, is to have the\r\nGovernment grant us a Subsidy which will make good to us THAT DIFFERENCE\r\nIN PRICE between home-made and foreign-made vessels WHICH OUR\r\nTRUST-CREATING TARIFF HAS CAUSED.\r\n\r\nThus we, the Privileged, will unload upon the Unprivileged BOTH\r\nLOADS,--that of the Trust, and that of OUR escape from THE ONE\r\nCONSEQUENCE of the trust WHICH HURTS US.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHERE IS ONLY ONE incident to the Protective system which is a drawback\r\nto the Trusts.\r\n\r\nThat is THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF CONTROLLING OCEAN TRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nEvery OTHER incident to the Protective System HELPS THE TRUSTS AND HURTS\r\nTHE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nThe one incident which HURTS THE TRUSTS AND HELPS THE PEOPLE must be\r\ndealt with.\r\n\r\nWe must so manage that ocean transportation shall likewise belong to the\r\nTrusts.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOW YOU SEE WHY YOU DON’T GET THE PARCELS POST.]\r\n\r\nBY GIVING TO THE MERCHANT MARINE A SUM OF MONEY OUT OF THE PUBLIC\r\nTREASURY, OVER AND ABOVE THE FREIGHT WHICH IS EARNED.\r\n\r\nThen, indeed, every incident of the Protective System will present a\r\nharmonious color-scheme, for THE TRUSTS WILL HAVE HOGGED THE WHOLE\r\nBUSINESS.\r\n\r\nAnd that donation out of your tax money, which is intended to save the\r\nTrusts from the injurious burden of their own damnable Tariff System is\r\nthe Ship Subsidy which the fat man said we need.\r\n\r\nSo long as the Protective System hurts the Common People it is a\r\nnational blessing and must be gratefully sustained: _but the moment the\r\nsame_ system pinches the Protected Interests, they must _rob you_ under\r\nthe form of Ship Subsidy to get back what they lose by their own\r\ntariff.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Appeal to Patriotism.\r\n\r\nSigns are plentiful that tens of thousands of honest Democrats and\r\nRepublicans are profoundly dissatisfied with the trend of recent events.\r\n\r\nWe look to the State, and no beacon light gives us confidence.\r\n\r\nThe time was when our rulers loved the people, trusted the people,\r\nworked for the people. Those were the times when there was light on the\r\nhearth, plenty on the board, and hope in the hearts of the people.\r\n\r\nThose were the times when our rulers _remembered that our forefathers\r\ncame here to build a temple, a government_, DIFFERING IN ALL VITAL\r\nRESPECTS FROM THE HATEFUL SYSTEMS OF THE OLD WORLD.\r\n\r\nFor this very purpose--that of establishing a system entirely different\r\nfrom that of Europe--our forefathers braved the perils of the deep;\r\nfought hunger and faced death; battled with the wilderness and the\r\nsavages it held; determined to die free, rather than live slaves.\r\n\r\nIn Europe they were fettered by class laws, class privileges, class\r\ntyrannies.\r\n\r\nThey were crowded out from a fair competition for a share of nature’s\r\nbounties by monopolies, chartered wrongs, statutory abuses, legalized\r\nspoliations.\r\n\r\nBraver than we, their degenerate sons, they counted life worth nothing\r\nunless freedom went with it, and THEIR COMING HERE WAS A SUBLIME PROTEST\r\nAGAINST THE OLD WORLD SYSTEM OF CLASS-LAW AND SPECIAL PRIVILEGE.\r\n\r\nWhat have we, today, _as the result of all their heroism, and suffering\r\nand success_?\r\n\r\nWe have our rulers aping everything Europe does, and fitting upon us,\r\nforever, the abominable system our forefathers fled to escape.\r\n\r\n_Where are class laws more insolently dominant than here?_\r\n\r\nWhere is Special Privilege more tyranically exacting than here?\r\n\r\nWhere are monopolies more contemptuous of law and public welfare than\r\nhere?\r\n\r\nWhat people are greater slaves to misgovernment than you whose\r\nlow-priced products must bear the strain of untaxed bonds, useless\r\noffices, and a steady growth of ever increasing salaries?\r\n\r\nWho pay _nine-tenths of all the taxes_?\r\n\r\nTHE MANY WHO TOIL.\r\n\r\nWho gets _the lion’s share of all the wealth produced_?\r\n\r\nTHE FEW WHO DO NOT TOIL.\r\n\r\nIn what country do the laborers, in shop and mine and mill and field,\r\nproduce more of the good things of life than ours?\r\n\r\nIt cannot be named.\r\n\r\nIn what country has nature opened her royal hands with a more regal\r\nbounty?\r\n\r\nIt cannot be named.\r\n\r\nHas there been any failure of harvest?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nHas there been pestilence, invasion, or civil strife?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nThen why is it that the signal guns of distress sound all along the\r\ncommercial seas, telling of brave ships going down?\r\n\r\nWhy is it that the feet of the homeless and the unemployed beat the\r\npavements of our great cities with a never-ending march?\r\n\r\nOh, brothers! why are so many hearths chill and dark, so many hungry\r\nmouths unfed, so many despairing souls weighed down with the nameless\r\ndread of the unknown future?\r\n\r\nWe have left the beaten track of our fathers. We have let the old\r\nlandmarks be forgotten. We have gone after strange gods.\r\n\r\nWe have foresworn the faith upon which our republic was founded, and are\r\nbeing led back to the system our ancestors came here to shun. Why can’t\r\nwe all see it? Why can’t we all act together? Why can’t we lay down\r\nprejudice, pride and passion, and devote our noblest efforts to the\r\nsalvation of our country?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ABSURD PROPOSITION.]\r\n\r\nHow can the Republican party cut loose from its Morgan-isms, its\r\nMcKinley-isms, its Carnegie-isms, its John Sherman-isms, its Standard\r\nOil-isms, its Steel Trust-isms.\r\n\r\nHow can the Democratic party cut loose from its Cleveland-isms, its\r\nCarlisle-isms, its Wall Street-isms, its Whiskey Trust-isms, its Sugar\r\nTrust-isms?\r\n\r\nNeither will ever cut loose.\r\n\r\nIn the coils of the serpents of the sea, Laocoon may struggle, but will\r\nnevertheless be powerless to escape.\r\n\r\nWhy cannot WE cut loose from these corrupt and class ruled\r\norganizations, as Jefferson cut loose from Federalism, as Jackson cut\r\nloose from National Republicanism?\r\n\r\nWhile we dispute as to names and organizations, the State suffers. While\r\nwe quibble over technicalities of political practice, liberty asks in\r\nvain for help.\r\n\r\nWould it were not so!\r\n\r\nWould that we could agree where we differ, unite where we divide, and\r\nlove where we hate.\r\n\r\nWould that some divine touch of duty could lift us all to the summits of\r\npatriotism where the only rivalry would be that of service--the only\r\npurpose that of redeeming the land from those who despoil it.\r\n\r\nCall the party what you please--names are nothing--but let us have a\r\nUnion of all patriots who believe in equal and exact justice to all men,\r\nwithout special privilege to any.

When it comes to claiming credit for _not_ cussing, I could\r\nname several things that dwarf the proportions of the Speakership of the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nMr. Roosevelt went down to Panama to take a look at that big ditch which\r\nnobody seems to be digging very fast. Thus far the trench appears to be\r\njust large enough to hold the millions of dollars that the taxpayers are\r\npouring into it.\r\n\r\nWhile he was down there it is to be hoped that Mr. Roosevelt gave close\r\nscrutiny to the place where the administration of Jules Grevy, President\r\nof the Republic of France, slid into that same ditch.

BAYNE.\r\n\r\nThe close of the old year and the beginning of the new finds the\r\ncivilized world in a state of parliamentary deliberation, with the\r\nestablishment of additional parliaments in various dependencies as one\r\nof the leading subjects of deliberation. The lawmakers of practically\r\nevery nation in the two hemispheres are now in session, so the\r\ndiscussion of budgets and the agitation of reforms furnish ever-changing\r\nsubjects of public interest.\r\n\r\nThe American mind has been moving forward from its varied and\r\nconflicting analyses of the recent elections to the concrete measures\r\nwhich will be introduced in Congress, and still it is unable to fix its\r\nattention definitely on serious subjects while the holiday spirit is in\r\nthe air. Members of Congress themselves feel that they are merely in\r\nWashington for a few days to outline a program for a later date.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: New York _Globe_\r\n\r\n“NOW TO BUSINESS.”]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President’s Message.\r\n\r\nCongress convened on the first Monday in December, and on the following\r\nday the President’s message was transmitted to that body. It is\r\ngenerally agreed that Mr. Roosevelt’s communications to the federal\r\nlaw-makers are increasingly partaking of the nature of open letters to\r\nthe American people rather than being definite suggestions to the House\r\nand Senate of the measures which should be enacted at the current\r\nsession into law. The present document is no exception to that rule. It\r\nis largely made up of homilies which recall the waggish comment of Tom\r\nReed about “Roosevelt’s delightful enthusiasm over his discovery of the\r\nTen Commandments.” Such is practically the view of The Washington\r\n_Herald_, for instance, which says that “Congress will regard the\r\ncounsels of the President as the obiter dicta of a distinguished\r\npublicist, awakening the public conscience, but without special bearing\r\non the work of the present session.”\r\n\r\nThe forces of reform were delighted to find him advocating a law\r\nprohibiting corporations from contributing to campaign funds, the\r\nfailure to pass which during the first session of the present Congress,\r\nwhen reform was in the air, was the subject of considerable criticism.\r\nIt is pointed out that he does not now go so far as to advise that all\r\ncontributions shall be made public. He is quoted, since the transmission\r\nof his message, as favoring a return to the large insurance companies of\r\nthe funds they contributed to the last Republican campaign, and this has\r\nbrought forth the question from his critics: Why disgorge only the\r\ncontributions of the insurance companies, when the funds belonging to\r\nstock-holders, as well as to policy-holders, have been used by various\r\ncorporations to influence elections?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Race Question.\r\n\r\nOne of those homilies to which reference has been made is the\r\nPresident’s discussion of lynching and the race question. No one will\r\ntake issue with him on what he says on the subject--unless it be on the\r\nstatement that two thirds of the lynchings are for crimes other than\r\nrape. He quotes Ex-Gov. Candler as saying that he had, within one month,\r\nsaved a dozen innocent negroes from lynching. After still further\r\ndiscussion of the question, the President advocates the infliction of\r\nthe death penalty for rape and urges that assault with intent to commit\r\nthis crime be made a capital offense, “at least in the discretion of the\r\ncourt.”\r\n\r\nAll this is, of course, a matter with which the states alone can deal,\r\nexcept in the territories under the exclusive jurisdiction of the\r\nfederal government. On the general subject of lynching, The Brooklyn\r\n_Eagle_ says that “the President is right in his preachment, but would\r\nbe tempted to ignore it if he were in private life, and a citizen of a\r\nSouthern state.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLabor Legislation.\r\n\r\nThe relations of labor and capital come in for considerable discussion,\r\nand the cause of labor is well sustained. The President advocates a\r\nrigid enforcement of the eight-hour law, where practicable, a\r\nconservative use of injunctions, and an investigation of the conditions\r\nof the labor of children and women.\r\n\r\nSenator Beveridge is already primed with a bill which will reach the\r\nchild labor question, through the elastic Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, by prohibiting the interstate transportation of commodities\r\non which child labor has been employed.\r\n\r\nThe President favors the enlargement of the Employers’ Liability bill,\r\npassed at the last session of Congress, so as to place the “entire risk\r\nof the trade” upon the employer, and he favors federal investigation of\r\ncontroversies between labor and capital.\r\n\r\nHe advocates an enlargement of the meat inspection bill, so as to\r\nprovide for placing the date of inspection on the label and throwing the\r\ncost of inspection on the packers.\r\n\r\nHe urges the more complete control of corporations in general, “by a\r\nnational license law, or in other fashion,” which is one of the\r\nutterances anticipated with the keenest interest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Washington _Post_\r\n\r\nTEDDY’S ONLY TARIFF REFORM.]\r\n\r\nHe comes out for an inheritance tax, an income tax, and mildly urges a\r\nship subsidy and currency reform.\r\n\r\nA bill providing for free trade with the Philippines passed the House in\r\nthe last session, but it met its death in the Senate at the hands of\r\nmembers who feared that it would seriously affect the beet sugar\r\nindustry. The President again recommends the adoption of this measure,\r\nor at least a reduction in the Philippine tariff; and, as one result of\r\nhis visit to Porto Rico, he asks that the inhabitants be granted United\r\nStates citizenship. A special message on this subject, it is said, will\r\ngo to Congress later.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Question.\r\n\r\nHis utterances on the Japanese question are perhaps the most sensational\r\nin the entire document. At least they have proven so, from two points of\r\nview. After paying a splendid tribute to the “little brown men” of the\r\nOrient, and advocating the adoption of naturalization laws in their\r\nbehalf, he makes an attack upon the principle of state rights which has\r\nattracted more than ordinary attention. The exclusion of Japanese\r\nchildren from the public schools of San Francisco, which is discussed\r\nmore at length elsewhere, has occupied a foremost place in the public\r\nmind for some time, and it is generally conceded to have largely\r\nresolved itself into a question of state rights, and the power of the\r\nfederal government to force an observance of international treaties on\r\nthe individual states, particularly where state laws alone are involved.\r\nThe President demands that the civil and criminal laws of the federal\r\ngovernment be so amended as to “enable the President to enforce the\r\nrights of aliens under treaties.”\r\n\r\nFurther along he made some nebulous threats about employing all the\r\nforce of the army and navy in behalf of the Japanese, if necessary, and\r\nat once the California representatives were, themselves, up in arms. The\r\nPresident hastened to explain that he had been misunderstood--that he\r\nonly meant to say that he would protect the Japanese from mob violence,\r\nby aid of the army and navy, if necessary, so the members from the\r\nPacific slope are satisfied.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the President has instructed the department of justice\r\nin California to make a test case of the state law segregating “the\r\nchildren of Mongolian parentage” from the whites in public schools, and\r\nit is believed that the matter will thus be settled.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the message is devoted to the Rio conference, the\r\nsituation in Cuba, Central America and Alaska, the maintenance of the\r\nnavy at its present efficiency, and the approaching session of the\r\nsecond peace conference at the Hague.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Watson’s Views.\r\n\r\nWhile various public men have selected a variety of sentences from the\r\nPresidential Message as being particularly striking, our readers may\r\nhave a natural curiosity to know what sentence in the message of the\r\nPresident most impressed our Editor-in-Chief. His section of the\r\nMagazine had been closed before the President’s message was made public,\r\nbut in a private letter to me, Mr. Watson remarks that the finest\r\nsentence to be found in Mr. Roosevelt’s recent message to Congress, is\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n“_Neither a nation, nor an individual, can surrender conscience to\r\nanother’s keeping. A just war is far better for the soul of a nation\r\nthan the most prosperous peace obtained by acquiescence to any wrong or\r\ninjustice._”\r\n\r\nMr. Watson thinks that the manner in which the President emphasizes the\r\nfact that a nation, like an individual, _should not consent to live_\r\nunder dishonorable conditions, was very fine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn addition to the editorial expressions which have been incidentally\r\nquoted in the foregoing summary of the message, The New York _World_\r\nsays that “if Roosevelt would advocate tariff reform and if Mr. Bryan\r\nwould stop advocating government ownership of railroads, they would be\r\nsubstantially in accord.” The New York _Tribune_ says “the message is\r\ncharacterized throughout by that courage with which the President\r\nhabitually faces public questions.” The New York _Press_ thinks the\r\nreading of it must have given the trust-owners “a night of restless\r\nslumbers.” The New York _American_ calls it “the most ambitious state\r\npaper of his career.” The New York _Times_ thinks the wisest counsel the\r\nPresident gives Congress is to “obviate the evil of prohibiting all\r\ncombinations of capital, whether good or bad.” The New York _Sun_\r\ndevotes its criticisms chiefly to those matters affecting the judiciary.\r\n\r\n\r\nCabinet Changes.\r\n\r\nThe echoes of the Presidential message had scarcely died away, when the\r\nPresident communicated to the Senate a long list of nominations which\r\nincluded many changes in his Cabinet. Root, Taft and Wilson will remain\r\nwhere they are. Charles Jerome Bonaparte, will become Attorney General;\r\nSecretary Victor H. Metcalf, Secretary of the Navy; Oscar S. Straus, of\r\nNew York, Secretary of Commerce and Labor; George B. Cortelyou,\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, in place of Leslie M. Shaw, who is to resign,\r\nand Mr. Cortelyou will be succeeded in the Post Office by Mr. George V.\r\nL. Meyer; James R. Garfield, Secretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Attorney General Moody to a position on the Supreme\r\nCourt Bench has brought forth considerable criticism. Before him, in\r\nthat capacity, must come for review much of the litigation in which he,\r\nas prosecuting attorney for the government, has been interested. Nearly\r\nforty million dollars in various suits are being held up for a hearing\r\nbefore a full bench. According to established precedent, Mr. Moody\r\nshould not pass upon them, after having been identified with them in the\r\nDepartment of Justice. No definite opposition to his confirmation is\r\nmanifested, however.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General Elections.\r\n\r\nThe general elections are receding farther and farther into the past,\r\nand public interest in the matter is abating. The returns in the state\r\nof New York, showing the election of the entire Democratic ticket with\r\nthe exception of the head, have been interpreted according to the\r\npersonal views of the interpreters, but the truth seems to be that there\r\nwas a general uprising in favor of reform, brought largely to the\r\nforefront by Hearst, but that the personality of Hearst himself, coupled\r\nwith his adhesion to Boss Murphy, was something that the people would\r\nnot stand for, and hence his defeat. Representative Jas. W. Wadsworth\r\npaid the penalty of his opposition to the meat inspection bill, and will\r\nnot be in the Sixtieth Congress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHEN THE SIXTIETH CONGRESS CONVENES\r\n\r\nWashington _Herald_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Brooklyn _Eagle_\r\n\r\n“DON’T DISTRACT HIS ATTENTION.”]\r\n\r\nA survey of the elections as a whole shows that the Republican majority\r\nin the Sixtieth Congress will drop from 112 to 58. The Republicans\r\ncarried every Northern state by reduced majorities, and the Democrats\r\ncarried every Southern state, in many instances by increased majorities,\r\nat the same time redeeming Missouri from the Republican ranks into which\r\nshe passed for the first time with the Roosevelt tidal wave. In the\r\nlower house of the Sixtieth Congress there will be an even hundred new\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans of the Senate, will probably make a gain of four\r\nmembers. The terms of thirty senators will expire on March 4, 1907,\r\nfifteen of them being Democrats and fifteen Republicans. Patterson, of\r\nColorado, Guerin, of Oregon--appointed to succeed the late Senator\r\nMitchell, who died in disgrace--Dubois, of Idaho, and Clark, of Montana,\r\nare the four Democrats who will probably be succeeded by Republicans.\r\nThen the Republicans in the Senate will have more than a two-thirds\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SENATOR JOHN F. DRYDEN.]\r\n\r\nSenator Dryden, the life insurance president of New Jersey, doesn’t know\r\nwhether the legislature in January is going to re-elect him or not--and\r\nno one else seems to know any more than he does. The Republican majority\r\nis very close, and there is considerable defection in the ranks. He may\r\nbe opposed by Gov. Edward S. Stokes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chicago _Inter-Ocean_\r\n\r\n“HUGHES WILL PUT IT OUT.”]\r\n\r\nPennsylvania went Republican all right, but it was not exactly as “Maine\r\nwent for Governor Kent.” Edwin S. Stuart--the first bachelor in a\r\ngeneration, by the way, to occupy the Keystone White House--is conceded\r\nto be “a very nice man,” so the Republicans elected him over the fusion\r\ncandidate, Emery. It is charged in some quarters that his election\r\nindicates that Pennsylvania has recovered from her spasm of\r\nrighteousness and reform, but the fact remains that Boss Penrose is now\r\nasking that things be done instead of demanding them, as he formerly\r\ndid, after the manner of the Quay school in which he was educated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: New York _Mail_\r\n\r\nTHE MAN THAT BEAT HEARST.]\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire has a peculiar election system. If no candidate receives a\r\nmajority over all, the election is thrown into the legislature. Hon.\r\nCharles M. Floyd, Republican, received a plurality, but not a majority.\r\nHis election by the legislature is assured, however.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. BRYAN--“ALAS, POOR HEARST! I KNEW HIM WELL!”\r\n\r\n--Chicago Tribune.]\r\n\r\nThe election of James O. Davidson as governor of Wisconsin was hailed\r\nas a victory for the anti-Follette forces, since they had opposed his\r\nnomination, but the junior senator made his influence felt in no\r\nuncertain way elsewhere, notably in the defeat of Representative\r\nBabcock, who has served seven terms in the house, and for a long period\r\nwas the official fat-fryer of the Republican Congressional Campaign\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spokane _Spokesman_\r\n\r\n“SHOVED OUT.”]\r\n\r\nThe new state of Oklahoma selected Democratic members of the\r\nconstitutional convention and will stand by Jeffersonian principles.\r\nSome effort is being made to embody white supremacy provisions in the\r\norganic law which is being framed, and this has started a discussion as\r\nto whether the President, under those circumstances, would issue the\r\nproclamation admitting the new state to the Union. It is recalled that\r\nunder somewhat similar circumstances the statehood of Missouri was held\r\nup for fifteen months.\r\n\r\nSuch is a running review of the results of the elections, but, as\r\npreviously indicated, the measures to which Congress will devote its\r\nattention after the Christmas holidays are the center of interest.\r\n\r\nA concerted effort is being made to force the administration to take up\r\nthe subject of tariff reform, notwithstanding the fact that the\r\nPresident ignored the subject in his message.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Divorce Congress.\r\n\r\nOne of the notable conventions of the year was that of the National\r\nDivorce Congress which assembled in Philadelphia on Nov. 19 and 20 for\r\nthe purpose of formulating a uniform divorce law which, it is hoped,\r\nwould be enacted by all the states of the Union. It was the legislature\r\nof Pennsylvania which took the initiative in this matter, not only by\r\ncodifying and examining its own laws, but by arranging a conference,\r\nthrough Governor Pennypacker, to discuss the matter of uniform divorce\r\nlaws. This conference was held in Washington last February and a\r\ncommittee was appointed to draw up a model bill to present to all the\r\nstates. Thirty states and territories were represented at the Congress\r\nin Philadelphia and the grounds for absolute divorce, as presented by\r\nthe committee and adopted by the Congress were:\r\n\r\n1. Adultery.\r\n\r\n2. Bigamy, at the suit of the innocent and injured party to the first\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n3. Conviction and sentence for crime, followed by continuous\r\nimprisonment for at least two years, or under indeterminate sentence for\r\nat least one year.\r\n\r\n4. Extreme cruelty, endangering life or health.\r\n\r\n5. Wilful desertion for two years.\r\n\r\n6. Habitual drunkenness for two years.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Situation in ’Frisco.\r\n\r\nAbout the least pacific section of our united country just at present is\r\nthe Pacific slope. The action of the Board of Education of San Francisco\r\nin excluding Japanese children from the regular public schools of the\r\ncity, and requiring that they be segregated in schools set aside\r\nexclusively for them, has aroused the deepest interest all over the\r\ncountry, and its echoes are reverberating on the shores of the\r\nChrysanthemum kingdom. It is becoming increasingly evident that the\r\nmatter of excluding the Japanese from the public schools is not the crux\r\nof the matter. It is but a symptom of a very general condition of\r\ndislike and distrust. The people of California frankly declare that the\r\nmore they see of the Japanese the less they like them and that since the\r\nRusso-Japanese war, as one resident of the state puts it, “the Japs are\r\ngetting too blamed cockey.” The Californians assert that they have the\r\nsympathy and support of the entire Pacific slope in their determination\r\nto hold the Japanese in check. They point to the fact that the little\r\nbrown men practically dominate the labor situation in Hawaii, and that\r\nthey are making that territory merely a half-way house to California,\r\nwhich they will likewise over-run. The labor unions, which are\r\nparticularly strong on the slope are strong in their antagonism to the\r\nJapanese.\r\n\r\nIt is boldly declared by many representative citizens of California that\r\nthey will not stop short of introducing a bill in this or the Sixtieth\r\nCongress excluding the Japanese from the United States on practically\r\nthe same terms as are now applied to the Chinese, who are held in some\r\nquarters to be more desirable.\r\n\r\nMany interesting questions of national and international law are\r\ninvolved in the present situation.\r\n\r\nThose who advocate a federal law excluding the Japanese are reminded\r\nthat the existing treaty, which was negotiated by Mr. Gresham in Mr.\r\nCleveland’s second administration, provides that “this treaty shall go\r\ninto operation on the 17th day of July, 1899 and shall remain in force\r\nfor a period of twelve years from that date.” Twelve months’ notice,\r\nfrom the time of expiration, must also be given by either party, if such\r\nparty desires to terminate the agreement. Notice of termination cannot\r\nbe given, therefore, until July 19, 1911, and until July 1912, it must\r\ncontinue as the supreme law of the land. Consequently the adoption of a\r\nJapanese exclusion law cannot become effective for five years and a\r\nhalf. The President’s advocacy of naturalization for the Japanese is not\r\nreceived kindly on the slope. In addition to all this Mayor Schmitz and\r\nAbe Ruef, the political “boss,” have been indicted for extortion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _TREED!_\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia _North American_]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Increase in Wages.\r\n\r\nThe month of November was marked by the announcement of the most general\r\nincrease in the wages of employes ever recorded in this country during\r\nso short a period. This increase was made, for the most part, by the\r\nrailroads and other large corporate interests and chiefly affects\r\nemployes whose salaries are less than $200 a month. In many instances\r\nthe advance began with the first of December, while in others it becomes\r\neffective with the new year.\r\n\r\nIt would be a difficult matter to make anything like an approximate\r\nestimate of this golden harvest which is to go into the pockets of the\r\nlaboring men. It is said by those who are in a position to know, that\r\nthe advance in wages announced by the railroads during the month of\r\nNovember would alone amount to $20,000,000 annually, affecting 200,000\r\nemployes. Even so conservative an authority as The Chicago _Evening\r\nPost_ thinks it entirely probable that the advance in the wages of\r\nrailroad employes becoming effective on the first of the year will reach\r\nsomething like $100,000,000 a year, while others place it still higher.\r\nThe Steel Trust and the street railroads have also advanced wages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDWARD H. HARRIMAN.]\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to say, in dwelling upon this general advance in the\r\nwages of labor in so many departments of industry, that, according to\r\nthe mercantile agencies, the cost of living is higher now than it has\r\nbeen at any time in twenty years, and the continuance of agitation and\r\ndiscontent in certain quarters is held to be justifiable for the reason\r\nthat the purchasing power of a dollar is so much less than formerly that\r\nit is no more than off-set by an increase of ten per cent in wages.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Harriman-Fish Embroglio.\r\n\r\nThe final triumph of Edward H. Harriman over President Stuyvesant Fish,\r\nof the Illinois Central, after a long and bitter feud extending over\r\nmany years, is still a topic of absorbing interest in the railroad world\r\nand to the public in general. At a special meeting of the directors of\r\nthe road held in New York early in November Mr. Fish was defeated for\r\nre-election by a vote of eight to four, the thirteenth director,\r\nVice-President Welling, being confined to his bed from an illness of\r\nwhich he died a few days later. The formal complaint made against\r\nPresident Fish was that he had not observed the “harmony” agreement of\r\nlast July, when it was at one time proposed that a special committee\r\nshould solicit proxies, and not Mr. Fish personally. He was charged with\r\narrogating to himself alone “the duty and function resting upon the\r\nentire board,” and not being able to “distinguish between the powers and\r\nduties of the president and those of the directors of the corporation.”\r\nThe purpose of the board was known before-hand and it was no surprise\r\nwhen James T. Harahan, one of the vice-presidents, was chosen to succeed\r\nMr. Fish.\r\n\r\nThe nomination was seconded by Charles A. Peabody, President of the\r\nMutual Life Insurance Company, which was one of the many reasons\r\nsustaining the belief on the part of Mr. Fish’s friends that his refusal\r\nto take part in the “white-washing” of the Mutual officials was really\r\nresponsible for his overthrow. It is recalled that Harriman made\r\nthreats at the time that he would make reprisal on Fish for his refusal\r\nto knuckle under.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STUYVESANT FISH.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Mr. Fish announced his intention of carrying the matter\r\ninto the courts. The constitution of the state of Illinois provides that\r\n“no railroad corporation shall consolidate its stock, property or\r\nfranchises with any other railroad corporation owning a parallel or\r\ncompeting line. A majority of the directors of any railroad corporation\r\nnow incorporated, or hereafter to be incorporated by the laws of this\r\nstate, shall be citizens and residents of this state.” Of the directors\r\nof the Illinois Central only three, at the time of the recent election,\r\nwere residents of the state of Illinois. They were Gov. Deneen, who is\r\nan ex-officio director by reason of his office as governor, James T.\r\nHarahan, the new president, and John C. Welling, who has since died. It\r\nis not denied that for thirteen years a majority of the directors have\r\nnot been “citizens and residents of Illinois,” and the scope of the\r\nimmediate issue is enlarged by the fact that if the courts hold the\r\npresent board to be illegal, so also will be the work of every board for\r\nthe past thirteen years, including issues of stocks, bonds, etc.\r\n\r\nHarriman’s control of so vast a system of railroads is naturally\r\nregarded as a menace. The Union Pacific and the Southern Pacific, of\r\nwhich he is absolute master, aggregate 15,000 miles, with an outstanding\r\ncapitalization of $1,031,000,000. The Chicago & Alton and the Illinois\r\nCentral, which he practically controls, have a mileage of 6,668, with a\r\ncapitalization of over $380,728,223. He is largely in control of the\r\nBaltimore & Ohio, the Reading and the Central of New Jersey railroads,\r\nwith a mileage of 7,255 and a capitalization of practically\r\n$770,000,000. He is a stockholder and director in Erie, which has a\r\nmileage of 2,553 and a capitalization of $382,900,000. Thus he is a\r\nmoving spirit and to a large extent the dominant figure in 31,000 miles\r\nof railroad, with a capitalization of more than two billions and a half\r\nof dollars. It is not surprising that an investigation on the part of\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission is now announced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS F. RYAN.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRyan’s Vast Interests.\r\n\r\nOne of the recent surprises in Wall street was the resignation of Thomas\r\nF. Ryan as a director from more than twenty railroads and industrial\r\ncorporations, including the leading trusts of the country. Coincident\r\nwith his retirement came the announcement that he was one of a number of\r\nAmerican capitalists who had secured from King Leopold of Belgium\r\ncertain rights in 8,400,000 acres of land in the Congo Free State, for\r\nthe purpose of developing the rubber and mineral resources, building\r\nrailroads and otherwise exploiting that vast territory.\r\n\r\nAn effort is being made in Congress to have this government join in an\r\ninvestigation of conditions in the Congo and several of Leopold’s\r\nlobbyists are in hot water.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lesson of Spencer’s Death.\r\n\r\nNo event in recent years has created a more profound sensation than the\r\ntragic death of President Samuel Spencer, of the Southern railroad, who\r\nwas killed in a rear-end collision on his own road on the morning of\r\nThanksgiving day. Mr. Spencer was a native Georgian, and worked his way\r\nthrough all the grades of his calling to the presidency he held at the\r\ntime of his death. Many personal tributes have been paid to Mr. Spencer,\r\nbut the fact that he was a victim to the inefficiency of his own\r\nrailroad system has been commented upon with decided emphasis. Readers\r\nof THE JEFFERSONIAN MAGAZINE will recall the heated controversy last\r\nsummer between Mr. Watson and the editor of The Macon _Telegraph_. The\r\nlatter criticised Mr. Watson for making the point that Mr. Spencer, as a\r\nrailroad manager, squeezed too much money out of the South into the\r\npockets of Wall street millionaires, allowing his road to become\r\ndangerous, allowing employes to be overworked, allowing bridges to\r\nbecome decayed, refusing to double-track where double tracking was\r\nneeded and refusing to employ a sufficient number of men to do the\r\namount of work necessary in the proper operation of the property. The\r\ntext from which Mr. Watson preached was the official commendation of Mr.\r\nSpencer by the voting trustees of the Southern Railway Holding Company.\r\nThey praised him because he had, during the last thirteen years, doubled\r\ntheir property, trebled the gross earnings, and increased the net\r\nearnings, over and above all operating expenses, more than 525 per cent.\r\nHe took this report and proved that instead of being something for Mr.\r\nSpencer to be proud of, it was something to make him ashamed, since it\r\nproved conclusively that the road was being run simply from the\r\nstandpoint of those who wanted dividends and who did not care how\r\nunsatisfactory was the service, nor how many lives were lost because of\r\nthe failure to adopt safety appliances, double tracks, and by failure to\r\nabolish the deadly grade crossings. Mr. Watson feels that the fate which\r\nhas overtaken Mr. Spencer is the most appalling proof that could be\r\nfurnished that he was right in his contentions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “HE WAS DEAF TO ALL WARNINGS, AND AT LENGTH HIS OWN TURN\r\nCAME.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT\r\n\r\nThe hand of the law will get old John D. himself yet.\r\n\r\n--Minneapolis Journal.]\r\n\r\nThe press of this country and England view the matter in the same light.\r\nThe Brooklyn _Eagle_, in discussing the matter, says, “We can only\r\ndeplore this very able man’s loss. We can only hope that his sacrifice\r\nmay result in no further disregard of the precautions that would have\r\naverted it, had those precautions been observed. Until that time,”\r\ncontinues the _Eagle_, “we may expect preventable ‘accidents’ which wear\r\nevery quality of murder except its intent.” _The Pall Mall Gazette_, of\r\nLondon, founded by W. T. Stead, expresses the hope that Mr. Spencer’s\r\ndeath “will arouse those responsible for the management of American\r\nrailroads to a feeling that it is desirable to make them safer.” The\r\nstatistics of accidental deaths in America, says _The Gazette_, “are\r\nappalling to the English mind, but seem to have little effect in\r\nAmerica. But the inclusion of directors among the victims is almost\r\nproverbial as the surest route to reform.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of these solemn warnings another fatal rear-end collision\r\noccurred on the Southern within ten days, a short distance from the\r\nscene of the former accident.\r\n\r\nMr. Spencer has been succeeded, as President of the Southern, by Mr. W.\r\nW. Finley, formerly second vice-president of the road.\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard Oil Before the Bar.\r\n\r\nThe most definite and concrete form which the agitation against trusts\r\nand combines has ever assumed in this country, and the most interesting\r\nlegal step the government has taken in a generation, was the filing of a\r\nbill in equity, by United States Attorney General Moody, on Nov. 15, in\r\nthe Eighth Judicial Circuit, in St. Louis, Mo., against the Standard Oil\r\nCompany, of New Jersey, and seventy of its subsidiary corporations and\r\nlimited partnerships, as well as against seven of the leading officers\r\nand directors of the big trust, to have the combination dissolved under\r\nthe Sherman Anti-Trust law, as being in restraint of trade and commerce.\r\nThe government, for nearly two years, has been gathering information on\r\nwhich to base some such action. But last June the attorney general\r\nappointed two assistants, Messrs. F. B. Kellogg and C. B. Morrison, to\r\nact with Assistant Attorney General Purdy in gathering information as to\r\nthe transgressions of the Oil Trust in the business of refining,\r\ntransporting, distributing and selling oil throughout the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STRIPES MAY GO ON YET, IF YOU DON’T WATCH OUT.]\r\n\r\nTheir report was such as to justify legal action on the part of the\r\nDepartment of Justice, and after the information had been carefully\r\nexamined by the President and the Cabinet, the bill in equity was\r\nfiled. The recital of alleged facts in this petition, is virtually a\r\nhistory of the Standard Oil Company from its infancy to the present\r\ntime. It sets forth that the Standard Oil Company, of New Jersey, with\r\nits seventy allied corporations and limited partnerships, produces,\r\ntransports and sells about 90 per cent of the refined oil products used\r\nin this country and about the same proportion of the refined oil\r\nexported from the United States; that this practical monopoly has been\r\nprocured by a course of action which, beginning in 1870, has continued,\r\nin the main, under the same persons down to the present time; that these\r\npersons now surviving are John D. Rockefeller. William Rockefeller,\r\nHenry H. Rogers, Henry M. Flagler, John A. Archbold, Oliver H. Payne and\r\nChas. M. Pratt; that their design throughout has been the suppression of\r\ncompetition in the production, transportation and sale of refined oil\r\nand to obtain a monopoly therein; that between 1870 and 1882 the purpose\r\nwas effected by agreements between many persons and corporations engaged\r\nin this business; that in the latter year the business was made certain\r\nby vesting in nine trustees, including five of the persons named above,\r\nsufficient stock in the thirty-nine corporations then concerned to\r\nsuppress competition among themselves; that this plan was acted upon\r\nuntil it was declared illegal by the Supreme Court of Ohio, in an action\r\nagainst the Standard Oil Company of Ohio, one of said corporations, in\r\n1892; that during the seven years following, the same individual\r\ndefendants, as a majority of the liquidating trustees, were pretending\r\nto liquidate the trust, but as a matter of fact were managing all the\r\ncorporations in the same old way and were exercising the same control\r\nover them; that in 1899 the individual defendants increased the capital\r\nstock of the Standard Oil Company, of New Jersey, from $10,000,000 to\r\n$110,000,000; that the company was then a producing and selling\r\ncorporation, and that they added to its functions the power of\r\npurchasing stock in other companies, and practically all the powers\r\nexercised by the trustees under the unlawful agreement of 1882; that the\r\nStandard Oil Company, of New Jersey, then taking the place of the\r\ntrustees, acquired all the stock of the corporations theretofore held\r\nand controlled by the trusts, paying therefor by the issue of its own\r\nshares in exchange; that the President of the Board of Trustees became\r\nthe president of the Standard Oil Company, of New Jersey, that the trust\r\nassumed the direction of the business of the Standard Oil Company, of\r\nNew Jersey, and has continued it ever since.\r\n\r\nAfter this summary of Standard Oil history, the petition goes on to say\r\nthat the purpose and effect of the corporation as a holding company was\r\nprecisely the same as the purpose and effect of the appointment of the\r\ntrustees previously referred to, namely: to suppress competition between\r\nthe corporations and limited partnerships, whose stock was first held by\r\nthe trusts and then by the Standard Oil Company, of New Jersey; that by\r\nthe foregoing methods, and by securing railroad rates which\r\ndiscriminated in favor of the corporations whose stock was held by the\r\nholding company, the latter was enabled to secure a monopoly in large\r\nsections of the country, with the result that prices to consumers are\r\nmuch higher in those sections than in sections where competition, to\r\nsome extent, prevails.\r\n\r\nThe bill further sets forth that from 1882 to 1895 the Standard paid\r\ndividends amounting to $512,000,000 on a professed valuation of a trifle\r\nless than $70,000,000, besides accumulating a surplus “of unknown\r\nmagnitude,” and that for the last nine years the dividends have run from\r\n33 to 48 per cent.\r\n\r\nAlmost on the very day that this bill was filed the Standard declared a\r\nquarterly dividend which aggregated $10,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn filing this bill Attorney General Moody said that the question of\r\ncriminal prosecution would be left “for future consideration.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCriminal Prosecution.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the disposition of the Attorney General of the United\r\nStates in regard to the criminal prosecution of Standard Oil officers\r\nand directors, there seems to be no doubt as to the attitude of\r\nProsecutor David, of the state of Ohio. The grand jury of Hancock county\r\nhas returned an indictment against the Standard Oil Company, of Ohio,\r\nand against John D. Rockefeller, president of the Standard Oil Company,\r\nof New Jersey, as well as three directors of the subsidiary corporation\r\nin the Buckeye state. Previous proceedings against the same defendants,\r\ntaken on an information brought before the Probate Court of that state,\r\nare now being held up, pending the decision of the higher court as to\r\nthe jurisdiction of the court below. The present indictments by the\r\ngrand jury are based on the evidence adduced in the previous trial.\r\nConviction would subject the defendant company to a maximum fine of five\r\nthousand dollars, which, however, it is believed, may be imposed for\r\never day covered in the indictments. Mr. Rockefeller and the directors\r\nof the subsidiary company would be subject to the same fine and to\r\nimprisonment for a period of from six months to one year. More recently\r\nProsecutor David is quoted as expressing the belief that he has\r\nsufficient evidence to bring not only Mr. Rockefeller, but all the\r\nhighest officials of the controlling company before the Ohio courts.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime he has taken steps to secure an alternative writ of\r\nmandamus against the Buckeye Pipe Line Company, said to be owned by the\r\nStandard Oil Company and operated in such a manner as to stifle\r\ncompetition, requiring that the defendant provide for the public equal\r\nand just facilities and demanding that they fix a schedule of rates.\r\n\r\nIn St. Louis the Federal grand jury has brought in two indictments, with\r\na total of seventy-two counts, against the Waters-Pierce Oil Company for\r\nviolation of the Elkins Anti-Rebate law. If convicted on all the counts\r\nthe maximum penalties would exceed a million and a half dollars.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings taken by the attorney general of Texas to oust the same\r\ncompany from that state have developed a collateral sensation of great\r\nsize. Attorney General Davidson demands of the defendant company certain\r\nvouchers which, it is alleged, will show that Senator Joseph W. Bailey\r\nwas paid various sums of money by the Waters-Pierce Company to secure\r\nits readmission to the state, and gives out that if this evidence is not\r\nforthcoming, secondary evidence will be offered to establish the alleged\r\nfact. Senator Bailey indignantly denies that he received any such sums,\r\nand announces that he will prosecute for perjury anyone who swears to\r\nthe existence of such evidence. Senator Bailey has already been\r\nnominated by primary, but his re-election will come before the\r\nlegislature which convenes in January.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the New York Central Railroad and the Sugar Trust have\r\nbeen fined heavily for, respectively, giving and receiving rebates.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Insurance Situation.\r\n\r\nOne of the results of the investigation conducted by the Armstrong\r\ncommittee into the affairs of the New York and the Mutual Life insurance\r\ncompanies was the enactment of legislation providing that the affairs of\r\nthe two companies should be taken out of the hands of the existing\r\nboards of trustees, that all outstanding proxies should be invalidated\r\nand that the policy holders should be given an opportunity to choose the\r\nmen who should thereafter manage the affairs of the two companies. In\r\npursuance of this law the policy holders began voting on Nov. 18 and\r\ncontinued to cast their ballots for or against the administration\r\ntickets until Dec. 18. In the New York Life the administration ticket\r\nconsisted of “the best of the old trustees,” together with some new\r\nblood, while an opposition ticket was presented by the International\r\nPolicy-Holders Committee, of which the Hon. Richard Olney was chairman.\r\nIn the Mutual contest there were three tickets: an administration\r\nticket, the United Committee’s ticket and a fusion ticket. The second of\r\nthese was so called because it was the product of the united efforts of\r\nthe Mutual Policy Holders’ committee and the International Policy\r\nHolders’ committee of which Mr. Samuel Untermyer was the chief organizer\r\nand sponsor. The fusion ticket was made up of candidates from the\r\nadministration and the Mutual Policy Holders’ respective rosters. At the\r\ntime we go to press the result of the elections is not known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT E. PEARY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFarthest North.\r\n\r\nCommander Robert E.

This was within 203 miles of the coveted\r\ngoal and thirty-four miles farther than the point reached by the Duke of\r\nAbruzzi expedition, which had hitherto held the record.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanadian Affairs.\r\n\r\nUp in Canada they are still telling the story of the _habitant_ who,\r\nwhen told that the Queen was dead, asked, “Who is Queen now?” He was\r\ntold that there was no Queen, but a King had ascended the throne,\r\nwhereupon the admiring peasant exclaimed, “My, what a pull he must have\r\nwith Laurier!”\r\n\r\nThe Canadian parliament assembled at Ottawa on Nov. 22--four months\r\nearlier than usual--with its Liberal majority practically unimpaired,\r\nand the Premier continues to hold the pre-eminence in Canadian affairs\r\nindicated by the artless tribute of the _habitant_.\r\n\r\nThe Dominion has not escaped the muck-rakers, and the Conservatives are\r\nbringing wholesale charges of corruption at the polls.\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 29 Minister of Finance Fielding introduced his long anticipated\r\ntariff bill. Briefly stated, this measure provides for an intermediate\r\ntariff, the rates of which shall be between the preferential rates\r\nconceded to the mother country and the general tariff which applies to\r\nother countries. This intermediate tariff may be held out as a basis of\r\nreciprocity negotiations with such countries as show a disposition to\r\nmeet the Canadian government half way.\r\n\r\n\r\nCuba and South America.\r\n\r\nThe situation in Central and South America is unusually quiet. As a\r\nresult of the President’s visit, the working forces on the Panama Canal\r\nhave been completely reorganized. It has been definitely decided not to\r\nappoint a governor of the Canal Zone to succeed Magoon, and an order has\r\nbeen promulgated to give Chairman Shonts more complete control over the\r\nadministration portion of canal construction, while Chief Engineer\r\nStevens is placed in absolute control over Panama. Bids for the contract\r\nto complete the canal will be opened Jan. 12.\r\n\r\nCipriano Castro, the fire-eating President of Venezuela, may not be\r\ndead, but he will soon work himself to death denying the charge unless\r\nhe does something definite before long. It is evident that he is in a\r\nvery low state of health, and the end may come at any time.\r\n\r\nAlfonso Penna was inaugurated President of Brazil on Nov. 16. He is in\r\nthorough accord with the efforts to establish closer trade relations\r\nbetween his country and the United States.\r\n\r\nArgentina holds her own as the most prosperous and progressive of South\r\nAmerican states, and Chili is rapidly recovering from the disastrous\r\nearthquake which visited her last fall.\r\n\r\nThe youth of the land, and even the children of larger growth, will be\r\nglad to know that according to recent investigations the Island of Juan\r\nFernandez, so dear to the hearts of every boy who has grown up on\r\nRobinson Crusoe, was not sunk into the sea by the disaster, as at first\r\nannounced, but remains intact.\r\n\r\nGov. Magoon has declared vacant the seats of the senators and\r\nrepresentatives elected to the Cuban Congress in 1905, and another\r\nelection will be held. The rivalry of Moderates and Liberals continues,\r\nwhile the Liberals, particularly, are divided among themselves. It is\r\nevident that American occupation of the island must continue for some\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeparation of Church and State.\r\n\r\nThat order of history which is “philosophy teaching by example” has been\r\nmoving steadily and persistently over the face of Europe toward a policy\r\nwhich the fathers of our own republic foresaw and adopted a hundred and\r\ntwenty years ago. Perhaps the most pronounced feature of Liberalism in\r\nthe Old World today is the conviction that the separation of church and\r\nstate must become an accomplished fact. A movement so vast could not be\r\ncarried forward without being complicated in some measure with bigotry\r\nand fanaticism, but on the whole it may be said that it is inspired and\r\nsustained by the highest motives of state policy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a Drawing by “Spy.”_\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY.]\r\n\r\nThe present Liberal ministry in England, which succeeded the Balfour\r\ngovernment, appealed to the country on the issue of free trade and was\r\noverwhelmingly sustained. But since that time it is safe to say that the\r\nEducation bill, introduced by Augustine Birrell, President of the Board\r\nof Education--and whimsically called the “Birreligious bill”--has been\r\nthe measure most discussed by the British people and the world at large.\r\nBriefly stated, this bill provides that, beginning with January of next\r\nyear, only such schools as are provided by the local educational\r\nauthorities throughout England shall be recognized as public schools,\r\nand after that date no public funds can legally be spent on any other\r\nschools. In other words, if the present denominational voluntary schools\r\nwish to receive government support they must become public schools, and\r\nas such must be content with the same undenominational teaching that is\r\ngiven in other public schools. The bill provides, further, that\r\nattendance shall not be compulsory, and that there shall be no religious\r\ntest for teachers chosen by the local authorities. In those schools\r\nwhich are taken over by the educational authorities from the religious\r\norganizations--by the consent of the latter, of course--religious\r\ninstruction may be given two mornings a week, but not by the regular\r\nstaff of teachers, and not at the public expense. The bill further\r\nprovides that $5,000,000 shall be appropriated for educational purposes\r\nby the government.\r\n\r\nThis measure, which has set all England in a ferment, was passed by the\r\nHouse of Commons, but in the House of Lords it met vigorous opposition,\r\nparticularly from the spiritual peers, headed by the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury. On Dec. 6 it passed the upper house, so mutilated as to be\r\nunacceptable to the Commons. The agitation in favor of mending or ending\r\nthe chamber of peers has been coming prominently forward. No basis of\r\ncompromise between the upper and lower house has yet been found. Since\r\nthe Education bill is sent back to the House of Commons with its most\r\nvital features stricken out, the Liberal Government will probably go on\r\nto other legislation, equally unacceptable to the peers, and thus force\r\nthem to reject a number of measures which are demanded by the people.\r\nThey will then appeal to the country, and the ending of a system of\r\nhereditary legislators may be involved in the popular mandate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREMIER GEORGES CLEMENCEAU.]\r\n\r\nOn the Liberal program is a bill abolishing plural voting. Under the\r\npresent system of property qualification a large landowner may not only\r\nvote where he resides but in every other place where he has property,\r\nand as the elections do not occur in England, as they do in this\r\ncountry, on one and the same day, it is entirely practicable for such a\r\nlandowner actually to vote for half a dozen parliamentary candidates. Of\r\ncourse the peers will oppose any reform of the present system of plural\r\nvoting, and thereby will come in collision with popular sentiment again.\r\nThe land tenure bill, by which a tenant may secure greater permanency\r\nin his lease or compensation for improvements in case he is\r\ndispossessed, and the trades unions bill, exempting the funds of labor\r\nunions from damage suits against members of such unions who may commit a\r\ntort, are also in the Liberal program, and both will be resisted by the\r\nupper house, thereby contributing to its own undoing.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisestablishment in France.\r\n\r\nWhile in England there are issues which dispute the first place with the\r\nEducation bill, there can be no doubt as to the pre-eminence, just at\r\nthis time, of the administration of the law providing for separation of\r\nChurch and State in France. It was early in December, 1905, that the\r\nFrench Senate adopted a measure which abrogated the Concordat, signed in\r\n1801 by the First Napoleon and Pope Pius VII. This measure had already\r\npassed the Chamber of Deputies in July. In France the churches are owned\r\nby the state and the clergy, regardless of denomination, are supported\r\nby the government, a member of the cabinet known as the Minister of\r\nPublic Worship, having supervision of ecclesiastical affairs. According\r\nto the terms of the new bill, no newly made clergyman of any\r\ndenomination is to receive support from the government of the republic.\r\nThose now getting it from the state will continue to do so, but the\r\nappropriations are to be decreased as the pensions and salaries of the\r\nclergyman now in office expire or are withdrawn. The churches and other\r\nplaces of religious worship will continue to belong to the state, but\r\nthey are to be leased to congregations of the churches or denominations\r\nnow worshipping in them. The Vatican is bitterly opposing the separation\r\nact, and there has been considerable delay in forming the associations\r\nto take over the church property under the terms of the law. Originally\r\nit was provided that the period during which these associations should\r\nbe formed would expire on December 11, 1906, but there is no intention\r\non the part of the Clemenceau ministry, which came into power late in\r\nOctober, to persecute the church. M. Briand, Minister of Public Worship\r\nand the author of the bill, announced in the Chamber of Deputies on Nov.\r\n10, that church property not claimed by the “cultural associations” by\r\nDec. 11 would pass under control of the state and finally go to the\r\ncommunes at the end of the ensuing year, but that in the meantime the\r\nchurches will remain at the disposition of the clergy. The way is thus\r\nleft open to the Vatican by the admission of the possibility that church\r\nproperty can be granted by state decree to associations formed before\r\nDecember 11, 1907.\r\n\r\nThe government’s inventories of church property were completed without\r\narousing as much hostility as they did in the beginning but as we go to\r\npress great excitement prevails.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Abolish Capital Punishment.\r\n\r\nNot only is the French government pursuing a peaceful policy toward the\r\nchurch, as far as possible, but a humane measure is now pending which is\r\nwell worthy of an era of civilization and enlightenment. A parliamentary\r\ncommission, to which the matter was referred, has, by a vote of eight to\r\ntwo, reported in favor of abolishing the death penalty, and substituting\r\nlife imprisonment. In extreme cases, solitary confinement is\r\nrecommended. It is not generally known, perhaps, that many of the\r\nleading countries of Europe have long since abolished the death penalty,\r\nexcept in trials by court martial. It seems a mockery that Russia should\r\nbe no exception to this rule, but in point of fact it was the Empress\r\nCatherine the Great who took the initiative in abolishing capital\r\npunishment. That the law is apparently disregarded is due to the fact\r\nthat the greater part of Russia is subjected to what is known as “the\r\nminor state of siege,” which admits of the application of military law\r\nto the trial of political prisoners. Capital punishment was abolished in\r\nGreece forty odd years ago, and since that time Roumania, Portugal, and\r\nthe Netherlands in the order named, have followed suit. It has been in\r\ncomparatively recent years that Italy, Switzerland and Norway adopted\r\nthe same measure of clemency, on the other side of the water, and Brazil\r\nand Venezuela in the southern part of our own hemisphere. So the\r\ncivilized countries which still retain capital punishment are the United\r\nStates, Great Britain, Germany, Sweden, Austria and Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiberalism in Spain.\r\n\r\nThe leaven of Liberalism has been working mightily in the direction of\r\nthe severance of church and state in the land of the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nThe weak and capricious youngster who occupies the throne of Spain sent\r\nassurances to the Pope, late in October, of his filial attachment, and\r\nall that sort of thing. Six days later he signed the Associations bill,\r\nwhich had just passed the Chamber of Deputies, restricting the power and\r\ninfluence of the church in a degree but slightly less than in France.\r\nThen he made a little speech. There is an old Spanish custom that the\r\npremier should give a banquet at the end of each year that he and his\r\ncolleagues in the ministry have been continuously in office. In view of\r\nthe fact, as the young king recalled, that one hundred and twelve\r\nministers had taken the oath before him during the four years and a half\r\nsince his coronation, there had been no banquets at the expense of an\r\nincumbent premier. Alfonso, in signing the Associations bill, expressed\r\nthe hope that Gen. Lopez Dominguez, who was then at the head of the\r\nLiberal ministry, with a large Liberal majority behind him in the\r\nCortes, “would be able to reintroduce so pleasant a custom.”\r\n\r\nAnd the premier said he hoped so, too.\r\n\r\nHaving passed the lower house and received the signature of the king,\r\nthe reform measure which is agitating all Spain went back to the Senate.\r\nIt must pass that body, and again receive the signature of the king, to\r\nbecome the law of the land.\r\n\r\nSince 1876, when the Roman Catholic Church was reestablished as the\r\nstate religion of Spain, after a period of seven years of freedom of\r\nthought, of education, of burial, etc., the Liberals have been slowly\r\nregaining the liberties secured by the revolution of 1868. The church\r\nhas made strenuous resistance and has pursued a reactionary policy which\r\nhas finally aroused all the liberal and progressive forces. The state\r\nalready provided that marriages between Roman Catholics must be recorded\r\nin the civil register in order to have legal validity, but the church\r\ncontends that civil unions are valid only when they are performed\r\naccording to canon law. The church has also arrayed itself against the\r\nmunicipal control of cemeteries, and demands that the custom of setting\r\napart certain sections of such cemeteries for the burial of foreigners\r\nand non-Catholic Spaniards shall be discontinued. Now the Liberals, who\r\nare in power, have taken the bit in their teeth, so to speak. It is\r\nproposed to emancipate the schools from monastic teaching, and to\r\nrequire a state registration of all the monastic orders in Spain, of\r\nwhich there is a large and increasing number since the agitation began\r\nin France. In short the state will insist upon the absolute control of\r\ncivil marriages, the municipal control of the cemeteries, and a strict\r\nregulation of the monastic orders.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Gen. Dominguez will not give that dinner. One faction in\r\nthe Cortes thought that some time should be devoted to a consideration\r\nof the budget, as well as to the separation act, and he was forced to\r\nresign. A new cabinet was formed which lasted just three days--including\r\na Sunday--and resigned. The Marquis de Armijo has succeeded in forming\r\nanother cabinet, with old Gen. Weyler, by the way, as minister of war,\r\nand he is endeavoring to go on--with what success remains to be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nGermany’s Isolation.\r\n\r\nIt is becoming very evident that the Triple Alliance, consisting of\r\nItaly, Germany and Austria, is becoming weaker every year. The\r\nfeebleness with which Italy supported Germany’s pretentions in the\r\nAlgeciras conference aroused the resentment of the Kaiser, who made it a\r\npoint to telegraph his thanks to Austria for the part she took on that\r\nsame occasion, thereby administering a silent rebuke to the kingdom\r\nbeyond the Alps. This luke-warmness on the part of Italy is but one of\r\nmany elements which go to establish the isolation of Germany among\r\nEuropean powers. Prince von Buelow, the German chancellor, in an address\r\nat the opening of the Reichstag, did the best he could to convince the\r\nworld that his imperial master had no sinister designs against anybody,\r\nbut the powers still look upon the Kaiser with suspicion, and it is very\r\napparent that he feels it keenly.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime France and England are drawing closer and closer\r\ntogether. The Anglo-Russian “understanding” is said to be very\r\nsatisfactory at present. The rumor went that the basis of this\r\nunderstanding between the Czar and King Edward was that both governments\r\nshould keep out of Tibet, that lower Persia should be given over to\r\nEngland as her sphere of influence, while Russia confined herself to the\r\nnorthern part, and finally that England should consent to the opening of\r\nthe Dardanelles to the Russian Black Sea fleet. The last item discredits\r\nthe whole program.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe rumor runs that the Shah of Persia is practically dying and his son\r\nhas been called to assume the regency. The Shah, before he was taken\r\nill, granted a national parliament to his people, of which, however,\r\nlittle has been heard of late. What the policy of his son would be if he\r\nshould succeed permanently to the throne is problematical, but behind\r\nthe occupant of the Persian throne and the policy he may adopt, there is\r\nalways the shadow of what is called, by acknowledged pre-eminence, “the\r\nEastern question,” which will continue to exist until Russia can get\r\nsome satisfactory port where her fleets will not be frozen up in winter\r\nand she may be free to sail the seas with her men-of-war and her\r\nmerchant-men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe elections for the Russian duma have not yet been held, but the\r\nassembly is expected to convene by March 1. The government is improving\r\nthe time disfranchising everybody who is likely to be hostile to the\r\ndivine right of kings, is executing or exiling political prisoners,\r\nwhile the peasants are being systematically robbed of the relief sent to\r\nprevent them from starving during the prevailing famine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe lower house of the Austrian parliament, after a stormy agitation of\r\nmore than a year, has passed a bill granting the franchise to every male\r\nAustrian over twenty-four years of age who is able to read and write,\r\nand has been a resident for at least a year in the place where an\r\nelection is held. The upper house is not inclined to accept the bill,\r\ndemanding two votes for married men over 35 years of age, but it is\r\nhoped that a compromise may be effected.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Far East, China is becoming more and more suspicious of Japan’s\r\nintentions in Manchuria, and is discouraging the attendance of Chinese\r\nstudents upon Japanese schools and colleges. Strong measures have been\r\ntaken to suppress the use of opium within ten years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAustralia is still gasping at the decision of Western Australia to\r\nwithdraw from the commonwealth and set up a government of its own.\r\n\r\nIn this movement, the Western section probably has the entire sympathy\r\nof Ex-Governor Bill Stone, of Pennsylvania, who is busy just now\r\nadvocating the separation of the Western half of his own state from the\r\nEastern half, so contaminated by wicked Philadelphia!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “I RECKON YOU’VE GOT SOMETHING TO TELL ME.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnn Boyd.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Will N. Harben.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nAnn Boyd stood at the open door of her corn-house, a square, one-storied\r\nhut made of the trunks of young pine-trees, the bark of which, being\r\nworm-eaten, was crumbling from the smooth hard-wood. She had a tin pail\r\non her arm, and was selecting “nubbins” for her cow from the great heap\r\nof husked corn which, like a mound of golden nuggets, lay within. The\r\nstrong-jawed animal could crunch the dwarfed ears, grain and corn\r\ntogether, when they were stirred into a mush made of wheat-bran and\r\ndish-water.\r\n\r\nMrs. Boyd, although past fifty, showed certain signs of having been a\r\ngood-looking woman. Her features were regular, but her once slight and\r\nerect figure was now heavy, and bent as if from toil. Her hair, which in\r\nher youth had been a luxuriant golden brown, was now thinner and\r\nliberally streaked with gray. From her eyes deep wrinkles diverged, and\r\nthe corners of her firm mouth were drawn downward. Her face, even in\r\nrepose, wore an almost constant frown, and this habit had deeply gashed\r\nher forehead with lines that deepened when she was angry.\r\n\r\nWith her pail on her arm, she was turning back towards her cottage,\r\nwhich stood about a hundred yards to the right, beneath the shade of\r\ntwo giant oaks, when she heard her name called from the main-travelled\r\nroad, which led past her farm, on to Darley, ten miles away.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it’s you, Mrs. Waycroft!” she exclaimed, without change of\r\ncountenance, as the head and shoulders of a neighbor appeared above the\r\nrail-fence. “I couldn’t imagine who it was calling me.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it was me,” the woman said, as Mrs. Boyd reached the fence and\r\nrested her pail on the top rail. “I hain’t seed you since I seed you at\r\nchurch, Sunday. I tried to get over yesterday, but was too busy with one\r\nthing and another.”\r\n\r\n“I reckon you have had your hands full planting cotton,” said Mrs. Boyd.\r\n“I didn’t expect you; besides, I’ve had all I could do in my own field.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my boys have been hard at it,” said Mrs. Waycroft. “I don’t go to\r\nthe field myself, like you do. I reckon I ain’t hardy enough, but\r\nkeeping things for them to eat and the house in order takes all my\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“I reckon,” said Mrs. Boyd, studying the woman’s face closely under the\r\nfaded black poke-bonnet--“I reckon you’ve got something to tell me. You\r\ngenerally have. I wish I could not care a snap of the finger what folks\r\nsay, but I’m only a natural woman. I want to hear things sometimes when\r\nI know they will make me so mad that I won’t eat a bite for days.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Waycroft looked down at the ground. “Well,” she began, “I reckon\r\nyou know thar would be considerable talk after what happened at meeting\r\nSunday. You know a thing like that naturally _would_ stir up a quiet\r\ncommunity like this.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, when I think of it I can see there would be enough said, but I’m\r\nused to being the chief subject of idle talk. I’ve had twenty odd years\r\nof it, Mary Waycroft, though this public row was rather unexpected. I\r\ndidn’t look for abuse from the very pulpit in God’s house, if it _is_\r\nHis. I didn’t know you were there. I didn’t know a friendly soul was\r\nnigh.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I was there clean through from the opening hymn. A bolt from\r\nheaven on a sunny day couldn’t have astonished me more than I was when\r\nyou come in and walked straight up the middle aisle, and sat down just\r\nas if you’d been coming there regular for all them years. I reckon you\r\nhad your own private reasons for making the break.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did.” The wrinkled mouth of the speaker twitched nervously. “I’d\r\nbeen thinking it out, Mrs. Waycroft, for a long time and trying to pray\r\nover it, and at last I come to the conclusion that if I didn’t go to\r\nchurch like the rest, it was an open admission that I acknowledged\r\nmyself worse than others, and so I determined to go--I determined to go\r\nif it killed me.”\r\n\r\n“And to think you was rewarded that way!” answered Mrs. Waycroft; “it’s\r\na shame! Ann Boyd, it’s a dirty shame!”\r\n\r\n“It will be a long time before I darken a church door again,” said Mrs.\r\nBoyd. “If I’m ever seen there it will be after I’m dead and they take me\r\nthere feet foremost to preach over my body. I didn’t look around, but I\r\nknew they were all whispering about me.”\r\n\r\n“You never saw the like in your life, Ann,” the visitor said. “Heads\r\nwere bumping together to the damagement of new spring hats, and\r\neverybody was asking what it meant. Some said that, after meeting, you\r\nwas going up and give your hand to Brother Bazemore and ask him to take\r\nyou back, as a member, but he evidently didn’t think you had a purpose\r\nlike that, or he wouldn’t have opened up on you as he did. Of course,\r\neverybody thar knowed he was hitting at you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, they all knew, and he had no reason for thinking I wanted to\r\nask any favor, for he knows too well what I think of him. He hates the\r\nground I walk on. He has been openly against me ever since he come to my\r\nhouse and asked me to let the Sunday-school picnic at my spring and in\r\nmy grove. I reckon I gave it to him pretty heavy that day, for all I’d\r\nbeen hearing about what he had to say of me had made me mad. I let him\r\nget out his proposal as politely as such a sneaking man could, and then\r\nI showed him where I stood. Here Mrs. Waycroft, I’ve been treated like a\r\ndog and an outcast by every member of his church for the last twenty\r\nyears, called the vilest names a woman ever bore by his so-called\r\nChristian gang, and then, when they want something I’ve got--something\r\nthat nobody else can furnish quite as suitable for their purpose--why he\r\nsaunters over to my house holding the skirts of his long coat as if\r\nafraid of contamination, and calmly demands the use of my\r\nproperty--property that I’ve slaved in the hot sun and sleet and rain to\r\npay for with hard work. Oh, I was mad! You see, that was too much, and I\r\nreckon he never in all his life got such a tongue-lashing. When I came\r\nin last Sunday and sat down, I saw his eyes flash, and knew if he got\r\nhalf an excuse he would let out on me. I was sorry I’d come then, but\r\nthere was no backing out after I’d got there.”\r\n\r\n“When he took his text I knew he meant it for you,” said the other\r\nwoman. “I have never seen a madder man in the pulpit, never in my life.\r\nWhile he was talking, he never once looked at you, though he knew\r\neverybody else was doing nothing else. Then I seed you rise to your\r\nfeet. He stopped to take a drink from his goblet, and you could ’a’\r\nheard a pin fall, it was so still. I reckon the rest thought like I did,\r\nthat you was going right up to him and pull his hair or slap his jaws.\r\nYou looked like you hardly knowed what you was doing, and, for one, I\r\ntuck a free breath when you walked straight out of the house. What you\r\ndid was exactly right, as most fair-minded folks will admit, though I’m\r\nhere to tell you, my friend, that you won’t find fair-minded folks very\r\nplentiful hereabouts. The fair-minded ones are over there in that\r\ngraveyard.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Boyd stroked her quivering lips with her hard, brown hand, and\r\nsaid, softly: “I wasn’t going to sit there and listen to any more of it.\r\nI’d thrown aside pride and principle and gone to do my duty to my\r\nreligion, as I saw it, and thought maybe some of them--one or two, at\r\nleast--would meet me part of the way, but I couldn’t listen to a two\r\nhours’ tirade about me and my--my misfortune. If I’d stayed any longer,\r\nI’d have spoken back to him, and that would have been exactly what he\r\nand some of the rest would have wanted, for then they could have made a\r\ncase against me in court for disturbing public worship, and imposed a\r\nheavy fine. They can’t bear to think that, in spite of all their\r\npersecution, I’ve gone ahead and paid my debts and prospered in a way\r\nthat they never could do with all their sanctimony.”\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment. A gentle breeze stirred the leaves of\r\nthe trees and the blades of long grass beside the road. There was a\r\nfar-away tinkling of cow and sheep bells in the lush-green pastures\r\nwhich stretched out towards the frowning mountain against which the\r\nsetting sun was levelling its rays.\r\n\r\n“You say you haven’t seen anybody since Sunday,” remarked the loitering\r\nwoman, in restrained, tentative tones.\r\n\r\n“No, I’ve been right here. Why did you ask me that?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you see, Ann,” was the slow answer, “talking at the rate Bazemore\r\nwas to your face, don’t you think it would be natural for him to--to\r\nsort o’ rub it on even heavier behind your back, after you got up that\r\nway and went out so sudden.”\r\n\r\n“I never thought of it, but I can see now that it would be just like\r\nhim.” Mrs. Boyd took a deep breath and lowered her pail to the ground.\r\n“Yes,” she went on, reflectively, as she drew herself up again and\r\nleaned on the fence, “I reckon he got good and mad when I got up and\r\nleft.”\r\n\r\n“Huh!” The other woman smiled. “He was so mad he could hardly speak. He\r\nfairly gulped, his eyes flashed, and he was as white as a bunch of\r\ncotton. He poured out another goblet of water that he had no idea of\r\ndrinking, and his hand shook so much that the glass tinkled like a bell\r\nagainst the mouth of the pitcher. You must have got as far as the\r\nhitching-rack before his fury busted out. I reckon what he said was the\r\nmost unbecoming thing that a stout, able-bodied man ever hurled at a\r\ndefenseless woman’s back.”\r\n\r\nThere was another pause. Mrs. Boyd’s expectant face was as hard as\r\nstone; her dark-gray eyes were two burning fires in their shadowy\r\norbits.\r\n\r\n“What did he say?” she asked. “You might as well tell me.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Waycroft avoided her companion’s fierce stare. “He looked down at\r\nthe place where you sat, Ann. right steady for a minute, then he said:\r\n‘I’m glad that woman had the common decency to sit on a seat by herself\r\nwhile she was here; but I hope when meeting is over that some of you\r\nbrethren will take the bench out in the woods and burn it. I’ll pay for\r\na new one out of my own pocket.’”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” The exclamation seemed wrung from her when off her guard, and Mrs.\r\nBoyd clutched the rail of the fence so tightly that her strong nails\r\nsunk into the soft wood. “He said _that_! He said that _about me_!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and he ought to have been ashamed of himself,” said Mrs. Waycroft;\r\n“and if he had been anything else than a preacher, surely some of the\r\nmen there--men you have befriended--would not have set still and let it\r\npass.”\r\n\r\n“But they _did_ let it pass,” said Mrs. Boyd, bitterly; “they did let it\r\npass, one and all.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, nobody would dare, in this section, to criticise a preacher,”\r\nsaid the other. “What any little, spindle-legged parson says goes the\r\nsame as the word of God out here in the backwoods. I’d have left the\r\nchurch myself, but I knowed you’d want to hear what was said; besides,\r\nthey all know I’m your friend.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, they all know you are the only white woman that ever comes near\r\nme. But what else did he say?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he had lots to say. He said he hadn’t mentioned no names, but it\r\nwas always the hit dog that yelped, and that you had made yourself a\r\ntarget by leaving as you did. He went on to say that, in his opinion,\r\nall that was proved at court against you away back there was just. He\r\nsaid some folks misunderstood Scripture when it come to deal with your\r\nsort and stripe. He said some argued that a church door ought always to\r\nbe wide open to any sinner whatsoever, but that in your daily conduct of\r\nholding every coin so tight that the eagle on it squeals, and in giving\r\nnothing to send the Bible to the heathens, and being eternally at strife\r\nwith your neighbors, you had showed, he said, that no good influence\r\ncould be brought to bear on you, and that people who was really trying\r\nto live upright lives ought to shun you like they would a catching\r\ndisease. He ’lowed you’d had the same Christian chance in your\r\nbringing-up, and a better education than most gals, and had deliberately\r\nthrowed it all up and gone your headstrong way. In his opinion, it would\r\nbe wrong to condone your past, and tell folks you stood an equal chance\r\nwith the rising generation fetched up under the rod and Biblical\r\ninjunction by parents who knowed what lasting scars the fires of sin\r\ncould burn in a living soul. He said the community had treated you\r\nright, in sloughing away from you, ever since you was found out, because\r\nyou had never showed a minutes’ open repentance. You’d helt your head,\r\nhe thought, if possible, higher than ever, and in not receiving the\r\nsocial sanction of your neighbors, it looked like you was determined to\r\nbecome the richest woman in the state for no other reason than to prove\r\nthat wrong prospered.”\r\n\r\nThe speaker paused in her recital. The listener, her face set and dark\r\nwith fury, glanced towards the cottage. “Come in,” she said, huskily;\r\n“people might pass along and know what we are talking about, and,\r\nsomehow, I don’t want to give them that satisfaction.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a fact,” said Mrs. Waycroft; “they say I fetch you every bit of\r\ngossip, anyway. A few have quit speaking to me. Bazemore would himself,\r\nif he didn’t look to me once a month for my contribution. I hope what\r\nI’ve told you won’t upset you, Ann, but you always say you want to know\r\nwhat’s going on. It struck me that the whole congregation was about the\r\nmost heartless body of human beings I ever saw packed together in one\r\nbunch.”\r\n\r\n“I want you to tell me one other thing,” said Mrs. Boyd, tensely, as\r\nthey were entering the front doorway of the cottage--“was Jane Hemingway\r\nthere?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, by a large majority. I forgot to tell you about her. I had my\r\neyes on her, too, for I knowed it would tickle her nigh to death, and\r\nit did. When you left she actually giggled out loud and turned back an’\r\nwhispered to the Mayfield girls. Her old, yellow face fairly shone, she\r\nwas that glad, and when Bazemore went on talking about you and burning\r\nthat bench, she fairly doubled up, with her handkerchief clapped over\r\nher mouth.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Boyd drew a stiff-backed chair from beneath the dining-table and\r\npushed it towards her guest. “There is not in hell itself, Mary\r\nWaycroft, a hatred stronger than I feel right now for that woman. She is\r\na fiend in human shape. That miserable creature has hounded me every\r\nminute since we were girls together. As God is my judge, I believe I\r\ncould kill her and not suffer remorse. There was a time when my\r\ndisposition was as sweet and gentle as any girl’s, but she changed it.\r\nShe has made me what I am. She is responsible for it all. I might have\r\ngone on--after my--my misfortune, and lived in some sort of harmony with\r\nmy kind if it hadn’t been for her.”\r\n\r\n“I know that,” said the other woman, as she sat down and folded her\r\ncloth bonnet in her thin hands. “I really believe you’d have been a\r\ndifferent woman, as you say, after--after your trouble if she had let\r\nyou alone.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Boyd seated herself in another chair near the open door, and looked\r\nout at a flock of chickens and ducks which had gathered at the step and\r\nwere noisily clamoring for food.\r\n\r\n“I saw two things that made my blood boil as I was leaving the church,”\r\nsaid she. “I saw Abe Longley, who has been using my pasture for his\r\ncattle free of charge for the last ten years. I caught sight of his\r\nface, and it made me mad to think he’d sit there and never say a word in\r\ndefence of the woman he’d been using all that time; and then I saw\r\nGeorge Wilson, just as indifferent, near the door, when I’ve been\r\nfavoring him and his shabby store with all my trade when I could have\r\ndone better by going on to Darley. I reckon neither of those two men\r\nsaid the slightest thing when Bazemore advised the--burning of the bench\r\nI’d sat on.”\r\n\r\n“Oh no, of course not!” said Mrs. Waycroft, “nobody said a word. They\r\nwouldn’t have dared, Ann.”\r\n\r\n“Well, they will both hear from me,” said Mrs. Boyd, “and in a way that\r\nthey won’t forget soon. I tell you, Mary Waycroft, this thing has\r\nreached a climax. That burning bench is going to be my war-torch. They\r\nsay I’ve been at strife with my neighbors all along; well, they’ll see\r\nnow. I struggled and struggled with pride to get up to the point of\r\ngoing to church again, and that’s the reception I got.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a pity to entertain hard feelings, but I don’t blame you a single\r\nbit,” said Mrs. Waycroft, sympathetically. “As I look at it, you have\r\ndone all you can to live in harmony, and they simply won’t have it. They\r\nmight be different if it wasn’t for that meddlesome old Jane Hemingway.\r\nShe keeps them stirred up. She and her daughter is half starving to\r\ndeath, while you--” Mrs. Waycroft glanced round the room at the warm rag\r\ncarpet of many colors, at the neat fire-screen made of newspaper\r\npictures pasted on a crude frame of wood, and, higher, to the\r\nmantel-piece, whose sole ornament was a Seth Thomas clock, with the\r\nTower of London in glaring colors on the glass door--“while you don’t\r\nask anybody any odds. Instead of starving, gold dollars seem to roll up\r\nto your door of their own accord and fall in a heap. They tell me even\r\nthat cotton factory which you invested in, and which Mrs. Hemingway said\r\nhad busted and gone up the spout, is really doing well.”\r\n\r\n“The stock has doubled in value,” said Mrs. Boyd, simply. “I don’t know\r\nhow to account for my making money. I reckon it’s simply good judgment\r\nand a habit of throwing nothing away. The factory got to a pretty low\r\nebb, and the people lost faith in it, and were offering their stock at\r\nhalf price. My judgment told me it would pull through as soon as times\r\nimproved, and I bought an interest in it at a low figure. I was right;\r\nit proved to be a fine investment.”\r\n\r\n“I was sorter sorry for Virginia Hemingway, Sunday,” said Mrs. Waycroft.\r\n“When her mother was making such an exhibition of herself in gloating\r\nover the way you was treated, the poor girl looked like she was ashamed,\r\nand pulled Jane’s apron like she was trying to keep her quiet. I reckon\r\nyou hain’t got nothing against the girl, Ann?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing except that she is that devilish woman’s offspring,” said Mrs.\r\nBoyd. “It’s hard to dislike her; she’s pretty--by all odds the prettiest\r\nand sweetest-looking young woman in this county. Her mother in her prime\r\nnever saw the day she was anything like her. They say Virginia isn’t\r\nmuch of a hand to gossip and abuse folks. I reckon her mother’s ways\r\nhave disgusted her.”\r\n\r\n“I reckon that’s it,” said the other woman, as she rose to go. “I know I\r\nlove to look at her; she does my old eyes good. At meeting I sometimes\r\ngaze steady at her for several minutes on a stretch. Sitting beside that\r\nhard, crabbed old thing, the girl certainly does look out of place. She\r\ndeserves a better fate than to be tied to such a woman. I reckon she’ll\r\nbe picked up pretty soon by some of these young men--that is, if Jane\r\nwill give her any sort of showing. Jane is so suspicious of folks that\r\nshe hardly lets Virginia out of her sight. Well, I must be going. Since\r\nmy husband’s death I’ve had my hands full on the farm; he did a lots to\r\nhelp out, even about the kitchen. Good-bye. I can see what I’ve said has\r\nmade a change in you, Ann. I never saw you look quite so different.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the whole thing has kind o’ jerked me round,” replied Mrs. Boyd.\r\n“I’ve taken entirely too much off of these people--let them run over me\r\ndry-shod; but I’ll show them a thing or two. They won’t let me live in\r\npeace, and now they can try the other thing.” And Ann Boyd stood in the\r\ndoorway and watched the visitor trudge slowly away.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she mused, as she looked out into the falling dusk, “they are\r\ntrying to drive me to the wall with their sneers and lashing tongues.\r\nBut I’ll show then that a worm can turn.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, after a frugal breakfast of milk and cornmeal pancake,\r\nprepared over an open fireplace on live coals, which reddened her cheeks\r\nand bare arms, Mrs. Boyd pinned up her skirts till their edges hung on a\r\nlevel with the tops of her coarse, calf-skin shoes. She then climbed\r\nover the brier-grown rail-fence with the agility of a hunter and waded\r\nthrough the high, dew-soaked weeds and grass in the direction of the\r\nrising sun. The meadow was like a rolling green sea settling down to\r\ncalmness after a storm. Here and there a tuft of dewy broom-sedge held\r\nup to her vision a sheaf of green hung with sparkling diamonds,\r\nemeralds, and rubies, and far ahead ran a crystal creek in and out among\r\ngracefully drooping willows and erect young reeds.\r\n\r\n“That’s his brindle heifer now,” the trudging woman said, harshly. “And\r\nover beyond the hay-stack and cotton-shed is his muley cow and calf.\r\nHuh, I reckon I’ll make them strike a lively trot! It will be some time\r\nbefore they get grass as rich as mine inside of them to furnish milk and\r\nbutter for Abe Longley and his sanctimonious lay-out.”\r\n\r\nSlowly walking around the animals, she finally got them together and\r\ndrove them from her pasture to the small road which ran along the foot\r\nof the mountain towards their owner’s farm-house, the gray roof of\r\nwhich rose above the leafy trees in the distance. To drive the animals\r\nout, she had found it necessary to lower a panel of her fence, and she\r\nwas replacing the rails laboriously, one by one, when she heard a voice\r\nfrom the woodland on the mountain-side, a tract of unproductive land\r\nowned by the man whose cows she was ejecting. It was Abe Longley\r\nhimself, and in some surprise he hurried down the rugged steep, a\r\nwoodman’s axe on his shoulder. He was a gaunt, slender man, gray and\r\ngrizzled, past sixty years of age, with a tuft of stiff beard on his\r\nchin, which gave his otherwise smooth-shaven face a forbidding\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n“Hold on thar, Sister Boyd!” he called out, cheerily, though he seemed\r\nevidently to be trying to keep from betraying the impatience he\r\nevidently felt. “You must be getting nigh-sighted in yore old age. As\r\nshore as you are a foot high them’s my cattle, an’ not yourn. Why, I\r\nknowed my brindle from clean up at my woodpile, a full quarter from\r\nhere. I seed yore mistake an’ hollered then, but I reckon you are\r\ngettin’ deef as well as blind. I driv’ ’em in not twenty minutes ago, as\r\nI come on to do my cuttin’.”\r\n\r\n“I know you did, Abe Longley,” and Mrs. Boyd stooped to grasp and raise\r\nthe last rail and carefully put it in place; “I know they are yours. My\r\neyesight’s good enough. I know good and well they are yours, and that is\r\nthe very reason I made them hump themselves to get off my property.”\r\n\r\n“But--but,” and the farmer, thoroughly puzzled, lowered his glittering\r\naxe and stared wonderingly--“but you know, Sister Boyd, that you told me\r\nwith your own mouth that, being as I’d traded off my own pasture-land to\r\nDixon for my strip o’ wheat in the bottom, that I was at liberty to use\r\nyourn how and when I liked, and, now--why, I’ll be dad-blamed if I\r\nunderstand you one bit.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I understand what I’m about, Abe Longley, if you don’t!” retorted\r\nthe owner of the land. “I _did_ say you could pasture on it, but I\r\ndidn’t say you could for all time and eternity; and I now give you due\r\nnotice if I ever see any four-footed animal of yours inside of my fences\r\nI’ll run them out with an ounce of buckshot in their hides.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well, well!” Longley cried, at the end of his resources, as he\r\nleaned on his smooth axe-handle with one hand and clutched his beard\r\nwith the other. “I don’t know what to make of yore conduct. I can’t do\r\nwithout the use of your land. There hain’t a bit that I could rent or\r\nbuy for love or money on either side of me for miles around. When folks\r\nfind a man’s in need of land, they stick the price up clean out of\r\nsight. I was tellin’ Sue the other day that we was in luck havin’ sech a\r\nneighbor--one that would do so much to help a body in a plight.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’m very good and kind,” sneered Mrs. Boyd, her sharp eyes ablaze\r\nwith indignation, “and last Sunday in meeting you and a lot of other\r\nable-bodied men sat still and let that foul-mouthed Bazemore say that\r\neven the wooden bench I sat on ought to be taken out and burned for the\r\npublic good. You sat there and listened to _that_, and when he was\r\nthrough you got up and sung the doxology and bowed your head while that\r\nmakeshift of a preacher called down God’s benediction on you. If you\r\nthink I’m going to keep a pasture for such a man as you to fatten your\r\nstock on, you need a guardian to look after you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I see,” Longley exclaimed, a crestfallen look on him. “You are\r\ngoin’ to blame us all for what he said, and you are mad at everybody\r\nthat heard it. But you are dead wrong, Ann Boyd--dead wrong. You can’t\r\nmake over public opinion, and you’d ’a’ been better off years ago if you\r\nhadn’t been so busy trying to do it, whether or no. Folks would let you\r\nalone if you’d ’a’ showed a more repentant sperit, and not held your\r\nhead so high and been so spiteful. I reckon the most o’ your\r\ntrouble--that is, the reason it’s lasted so long, is due to the\r\nwomen-folks more than the men of the community, anyhow. You see, it\r\nsorter rubs women’s wool the wrong way to see about the only prosperity\r\na body can see in the entire county falling at the feet of the\r\none--well, the one least expected to have sech things--the one, I mought\r\nsay, who hadn’t lived exactly up to the _best_ precepts.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t go to men like you for my precepts,” the woman hurled at him,\r\n“and I haven’t got any time for palavering. All I want to do is to give\r\nyou due notice not to trespass on my land, and I’ve done that plain\r\nenough, I reckon.”\r\n\r\nAbe Longley’s thin face showed anger that was even stronger than his\r\navarice; he stepped nearer to her, his eyes flashing, his wide upper-lip\r\ntwitching nervously. “Do you know,” he said, “that it’s purty foolhardy\r\nof you to take up a fight like that agin a whole community. You know you\r\nhain’t agoin’ to make a softer bed to lie on. You know, if you find\r\nfault with me for not denouncin’ Bazemore, you may as well find fault\r\nwith every living soul that was under reach o’ his voice, fer nobody\r\nbudged or said a word in yore defence.”\r\n\r\n“I’m taking up a fight with no one,” the woman said, firmly. “They can\r\nlisten to what they want to listen to. The only thing I’m going to do in\r\nfuture is to see that no person uses me for profit and then willingly\r\nsees me spat upon. That’s all I’ve got to say to you.” And, turning, she\r\nwalked away, leaving him standing as if rooted among his trees on the\r\nbrown mountain-side.\r\n\r\n“He’ll go home and tell his wife, and she’ll gad about and fire the\r\nwhole community against me,” Mrs. Boyd mused; “but I don’t care. I’ll\r\nhave my rights if I die for it.”\r\n\r\nAn hour later, in another dress and a freshly washed and ironed gingham\r\nbonnet, she fed her chickens from a pan of wet cornmeal dough, locked up\r\nher house carefully, fastened down the window-sashes on the inside by\r\nplacing sticks above the movable ones, and trudged down the road to\r\nGeorge Wilson’s country-store at the crossing of the roads which led\r\nrespectively to Springtown, hard-by on one side, and Darley, farther\r\naway on the other.\r\n\r\nThe store was a long, frame building which had once been whitewashed,\r\nbut was now only a fuzzy, weather-beaten gray. As was usual in such\r\nstructures, the front walls of planks rose higher than the pointed roof,\r\nand held large and elaborate lettering which might be read quite a\r\ndistance away. Thereon the young storekeeper made the questionable\r\nstatement that a better price for produce was given at his establishment\r\nthan at Darley, where high rent, taxes, and clerk-hire had to be paid,\r\nand, moreover, that his goods were sold cheaper because, unlike the town\r\ndealers, he lived on the products from his own farm and employed no\r\nhelp. In front of the store, convenient alike to both roads, stood a\r\nrustic hitching-rack made of unbarked oaken poles into which railway\r\nspikes had been driven, and on which horseshoes had been nailed to hold\r\nthe reins of any customer’s mount. On the ample porch of the store stood\r\na new machine for the hulling of peas, several ploughs, and a\r\nred-painted device for the dropping and covering of seed-corn. On the\r\nwalls within hung various pieces of tinware and harnesses and saddles,\r\nand the two rows of shelving held a good assortment of general\r\nmerchandise.\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Boyd entered the store, Wilson, a blond young man with an ample\r\nmustache, stood behind the counter talking to an Atlanta drummer who\r\nhad driven out from Darley to sell the storekeeper some dry-goods and\r\nnotions, and he did not come to her at once, but delayed to see the\r\ndrummer make an entry in his order-book; then he advanced to her.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, Mrs. Boyd,” he smiled, “I am ordering some new prints for\r\nyou ladies, and I wanted to see that he got the number of bolts down\r\nright. This is early for you to be out, isn’t it? It’s been many a day\r\nsince I’ve seen you pass this way before dinner. I took a sort of\r\nliberty with you yesterday, knowing how good-natured you are. Dave\r\nPrixon was going your way with his empty wagon, and, as I was about to\r\nrun low on your favorite brand of flour, I sent you a barrel and put it\r\non your account at the old price. I thought you’d keep it. You may have\r\nsome yet on hand, but this will come handy when you get out.”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t intend to keep it,” replied the woman, under her bonnet,\r\nand her voice sounded harsh and crisp. “I haven’t touched it. It’s out\r\nin the yard where Prixon dumped it. If it was to rain on it I reckon it\r\nwould mildew. It wouldn’t be my loss. I didn’t order it put there.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Mrs. Boyd!” and Wilson’s tone and surprised glance at the drummer\r\ncaused that dapper young man to prick up his ears and move nearer; “why,\r\nit’s the best brand I handle, and you said the last gave you particular\r\nsatisfaction, so I naturally--”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t want it; I didn’t order it, and I don’t intend to have\r\nyou nor no one else unloading stuff in my front yard whenever you take a\r\nnotion and want to make money by the transaction. Deduct that from my\r\nbill, and tell me what I owe you. I want to settle in full.”\r\n\r\n“But--but--” Wilson had never seemed to the commercial traveller to be\r\nso much disturbed; he was actually pale, and his long hands, which\r\nrested on the smooth surface of the counter, were trembling--“but I\r\ndon’t understand,” he floundered. “It’s only the middle of the month,\r\nMrs. Boyd, and I never run up accounts till the end. You are not going\r\n_off_, are you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh no,” and the woman pushed back her bonnet and eyed him almost\r\nfiercely, “you needn’t any of you think that. I’m going to stay right on\r\nhere; but I’ll tell you what I am going to do, George Wilson--I’m going\r\nto buy my supplies in the future at Darley. You see, since this talk of\r\nburning the very bench I sit on in the house of God, which you and your\r\nilk set and listen to, why--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mrs. Boyd,” he broke in, “now don’t go and blame me for what\r\nBrother Bazemore said when he was--”\r\n\r\n“_Brother_ Bazemore!” The woman flared up and brought her clinched hand\r\ndown on the counter. “I’ll never as long as I live let another dollar of\r\nmy money pass into the hands of a man who calls that man brother. You\r\nsat still and raised no protest against what he said, and that ends\r\nbusiness between us for all time. There is no use talking about it. Make\r\nout my account, and don’t keep me standing here to be stared at like I\r\nwas a curiosity in a side-show.”\r\n\r\n“All right, Mrs. Boyd; I’m sorry,” faltered Wilson, with a glance at the\r\ndrummer, who, feeling that he had been alluded to, moved discreetly\r\nacross the room and leaned against the opposite counter. “I’ll go back\r\nto the desk and make it out.”\r\n\r\nShe stood motionless where he had left her till he came back with her\r\naccount in his hand, then from a leather bag she counted out the money\r\nand paid it to him. The further faint, half-fearful apologies which\r\nWilson ventured on making seemed to fall on closed ears, and, with the\r\nreceipted bill in her bag, she strode from the house. He followed her to\r\nthe door and stood looking after her as she angrily trudged back towards\r\nher farm.\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” he sighed, as the drummer came to his elbow and stared at\r\nhim wonderingly, “there goes the best and most profitable customer I’ve\r\nhad since I began selling goods. It’s made me sick at heart, Masters. I\r\ndon’t see how I can do without her, and yet I don’t blame her one\r\nbit--not a bit, so help me God.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nWilson turned, and with a frown went moodily back to his desk and sat\r\ndown on the high stool gloomily eyeing the page in a ledger which he had\r\njust consulted.\r\n\r\n“By George, that woman’s a corker,” said the drummer, sociably, as he\r\ncame back and stood near the long wood-stove. “Of course, I don’t know\r\nwhat it’s all about, but she’s her own boss, I’ll stake good money on\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\n“She’s about the sharpest and in many ways the strongest woman in the\r\nstate,” said the storekeeper, with a sigh. “Good Lord, Masters, she’s\r\nbeen my main-stay ever since I opened this shack, and now to think\r\nbecause that loud-mouthed Bazemore, who expects me to pay a good part of\r\nhis salary, takes a notion to rip her up the back in meeting, why--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I see!” cried the drummer--“I understand it now. I heard about that\r\nat Darley. So _she’s_ the woman! Well, I’m glad I got a good look at\r\nher. I see a lot of queer things in going about over the country, but I\r\ndon’t think I ever ran across just her sort.”\r\n\r\n“She’s had a devil of a life, Masters, from the time she was a blooming,\r\npretty young girl till now that she is at war with everybody within\r\nmiles of her. She’s always been a study to me. She’s treated me more\r\nlike a son than anything else--doing everything in her power to help me\r\nalong, buying, by George, things sometimes that I knew she didn’t need\r\nbecause it would help me out, and now, because I didn’t get up in\r\nmeeting last Sunday and call that man down she holds me accountable. I\r\ndon’t know but what she’s right. Why should I take her hard-earned money\r\nand sit still and allow her to be abused? She’s simply got pride, and,\r\nlots of it, and it’s bad hurt.”\r\n\r\n“But what was it all about?” the drummer inquired.\r\n\r\n“The start of it was away back when she was a girl, as I said,” began\r\nthe storekeeper. “You’ve heard of Colonel Preston Chester, our biggest\r\nplanter, who lives a mile from here--old-time chap, fighter of duels,\r\nofficer in the army, and all that?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, I’ve seen him; in fact, I was at college at the State\r\nUniversity with his son Langdon. He was a terrible fellow--very wild and\r\nreckless, full half the time, and playing poker every night. He was\r\nnever known to pay a debt, even to his best friends.”\r\n\r\n“Langdon is a chip off of the old block,” said Wilson. “His father was\r\njust like him when he was a young man. Between you and me, the Colonel\r\nnever had a conscience; old as he now is, he will sit and laugh about\r\nhis pranks right in the presence of his son. It’s no wonder the boy\r\nturned out like he did. Well, away back when this Mrs. Boyd was a young\r\nand pretty girl, the daughter of honest, hard-working people, who owned\r\na little farm back of his place, he took an idle fancy to her. I’m\r\ntelling you now what has gradually leaked out in one way and another\r\nsince. He evidently won her entire confidence, made her believe he was\r\ngoing to marry her, and, as he was a dashing young fellow, she must have\r\nfallen in love with him. Nobody knows how that was, but one thing is\r\nsure, and that is that he was seen about with her almost constantly for\r\na whole year, and then he stopped off suddenly. The report went out that\r\nhe’d made up his mind to get married to a young woman in Alabama who had\r\na lot of money, and he did go off and bring home the present Mrs.\r\nChester, Langdon’s mother. Well, old-timers say young Ann Boyd took it\r\nhard, stayed close in at home and wasn’t seen out for a couple of years.\r\nThen she came out again, and they say she was better-looking than ever\r\nand a great deal more serious and sensible. Joe Boyd was a young farmer\r\nthose days, and a sort of dandy, and he fell in love with her and hung\r\nabout her day and night, never seeming willing to let her out of his\r\nsight. Several other fellows, they say, was after her, but she seemed to\r\nlike Joe the best, but nothing he’d do or say would make her accept him.\r\nI can see through it now, looking back on what has since leaked out, but\r\nnobody understood it then, for she had evidently got over her attachment\r\nfor Colonel Chester, and Joe was a promising fellow, strong,\r\ngood-looking, and a great beau and flirt among women, half a dozen being\r\nin love with him, but Ann simply wouldn’t take him, and it was the talk\r\nof the whole county. He was simply desperate, folks say, going about\r\nboring everybody he met with his love affair. Finally her mother and\r\nfather and all her friends got after her to marry Joe, and she gave in.\r\nAnd then folks wondered more than ever why she’d delayed for she was\r\nmore in love with her husband than anybody had any reason to expect.\r\nThey were happy, too. A child was born, a little girl, and that seemed\r\nto make them happier. Then Mrs. Boyd’s mother and father died, and she\r\ncame into the farm, and the Boyds were comfortable in every way. Then\r\nwhat do you think happened?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been wondering all along,” the drummer laughed. “I can see you’re\r\nholding something up your sleeve.”\r\n\r\n“Well, this happened. Colonel Chester’s wife was, even then, a homely\r\nwoman, about as old as he was, and not at all attractive aside from her\r\nmoney, and marrying hadn’t made him any the less devilish. They say he\r\nsaw Mrs. Boyd at meeting one day and hardly took his eyes off of her\r\nduring preaching. She had developed into about the most stunning-looking\r\nwoman anywhere about, and knew how to dress, which was something Mrs.\r\nChester, with all her chances, had never seemed to get onto. Well, that\r\nwas the start of it, and from that day on Chester seemed to have nothing\r\non his mind but the good looks of his old sweetheart. Folks saw him on\r\nhis horse riding about where he could get to meet her, and then it got\r\nreported that he was actually forcing himself on her to such an extent\r\nthat Joe Boyd was worked up over it, aided by the eternal gab of all the\r\nwomen in the section.”\r\n\r\n“Did Colonel Chester’s wife get onto it?” the drummer wanted to know.\r\n\r\n“It don’t seem like she did,” answered Wilson. “She was away visiting\r\nher folks in the South most of the time, with Langdon, who was a baby\r\nthen, and it may be that she didn’t care. Some folks thought she was\r\nweak-minded; she never seemed to have any will of her own, but left the\r\nColonel to manage her affairs without a word.”\r\n\r\n“Well, go on with your story,” urged the drummer.\r\n\r\n“There isn’t much more to tell about the poor woman,” continued Wilson.\r\n“As I said, Chester got to forcing himself on her, and I reckon she\r\ndidn’t want to tell her husband what she was trying to forget for fear\r\nof a shooting scrape, in which Joe would get the worst of it; but this\r\nhappened: Joe was off at court in Darley and sent word home to his wife\r\nthat he was to be held all night on a jury. The man that took the\r\nmessage rode home alongside of Chester and told him about it. Well, I\r\nreckon, all hell broke out in Chester that night. He was a drinking man,\r\nand he tanked up, and, as his wife was away, he had plenty of liberty.\r\nWell, he simply went over to Joe Boyd’s house and went in. It was about\r\nten o’clock. My honest conviction is, no matter what others think, that\r\nshe tried her level best to make him leave without rousing the\r\nneighborhood, but he wouldn’t go, but sat there in the dark with his\r\ncoat off, telling her he loved her more than her husband did, and that\r\nhe never had loved his wife and that he was crazy for her, and the like.\r\nHow long this went on with her imploring and praying to him to go, I\r\ndon’t know; but, at any rate, they both heard the gate-latch click and\r\nJoe Boyd come right up the gravel-walk. I reckon the poor woman was\r\nscared clean out of her senses, for she made no outcry, and Chester went\r\nto a window, his coat on his arm, and was climbing out when Joe, who\r\ncouldn’t get in at the front door was making for the one in the rear,\r\nmet him face to face.”\r\n\r\n“Great goodness!” ejaculated the commercial traveller.\r\n\r\n“Well, you bet, the devil was to pay,” went on the storekeeper grimly.\r\n“Chester was mad and reckless, and, being hot with liquor, and regarding\r\nBoyd as far beneath him socially, instead of making satisfactory\r\nexplanations, they say he simply swore at Boyd and stalked away.\r\nDumfounded, Boyd went inside to his miserable wife and demanded an\r\nexplanation. She has since learned how to use her wits with the best in\r\nthe land, but she was young then, and so, by her silence, she made\r\nmatters worse for herself. He forced her to explain, and, seeing no\r\nother way out of the affair, she decided to throw herself on his mercy\r\nand make a clean breast of things she and her family had kept back all\r\nthe time. Well, sir, she confessed to what had happened away back before\r\nChester had deserted her, no doubt telling a straight story of her\r\nabsolute purity and faithfulness to Boyd after marriage. Poor old Joe!\r\nHe wasn’t a fighting man, and, instead of following Chester and\r\ndemanding satisfaction, he stayed at home that night, no doubt suffering\r\nthe agony of the damned and trying to make up his mind to believe in\r\nhis wife and to stand by her. As it looks now, he evidently decided to\r\nmake the best of it, and might have succeeded, but somehow it got out\r\nabout Chester being caught there, and that started gossip so hot that\r\nher life and his became almost unbearable. It might have died a natural\r\ndeath in time, but Mrs. Boyd had an enemy, Mrs. Jane Hemingway, who had\r\nbeen one of the girls who was in love with Joe Boyd. It seems that she\r\nhad never got over Joe’s marrying another woman, and when she heard this\r\nscandal she nagged and teased Joe about his babyishness in being willing\r\nto believe his wife, and told him so many lies that Boyd finally quit\r\nstaying at home, sulking about in the mountains, and making trips away\r\ntill he finally applied for a divorce. Ignorant and inexperienced as she\r\nwas, and proud, Mrs. Boyd made no defence, and the whole thing went his\r\nway with very little publicity. But the hardest part for her to bear was\r\nwhen, having the court’s decree to take charge of his child, Boyd came\r\nand took it away.”\r\n\r\n“Good gracious! that was tough, wasn’t it?” exclaimed the drummer.\r\n\r\n“That’s what it was, and they say it fairly upset her mind. They\r\nexpected her to fight like a tiger for her young, but at the time they\r\ncame for it she only seemed stupefied. The little girl was only three\r\nyears old, but they say Ann came in the room and said she was going to\r\nask the child if it was willing to leave her, and they say she calmly\r\nput the question, and the baby, not knowing what she meant, said, ‘Yes.’\r\nThen they say Ann talked to it as if it were a grown person, and told\r\nher to go, that she’d never give her a thought in the future, and never\r\nwanted to lay eyes on her again.”\r\n\r\n“That was pitiful, wasn’t it?” said Masters. “By George, we don’t dream\r\nof what is going on in the hearts of men and women we meet face to face\r\nevery day. And that’s what started her in the life she’s since led.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, she lived in her house like a hermit, never going out unless she\r\nabsolutely had to. She had an old-fashioned loom in a shed-room\r\nadjoining her house, and night and day people passing along the road\r\ncould hear her thumping away on it. She kept a lot of fine sheep,\r\nfeeding and shearing them herself, and out of the wool she wove a\r\ncertain kind of jean cloth which she sold at a fancy figure. I’ve seen\r\nwagon loads of it pass along the road billed to a big house in Atlanta.\r\nThis went on for several years, and then it was noticed that she was\r\naccumulating money. She was buying all the land she could around her\r\nhouse, as if to force folks as far from her as possible, and she turned\r\nthe soil to good purpose, for she knew how to work it. She hired negroes\r\nfor cash, when others were paying in old clothes and scraps, and, as she\r\nwent to the field with them and worked in the sun and rain like a man,\r\nshe got more out of her planting than the average farmer.”\r\n\r\n“So she’s really well off?” said the drummer.\r\n\r\n“Got more than almost anybody else in the county,” said Wilson. “She’s\r\ngot stocks in all sorts of things, and owns houses on the main street in\r\nDarley, which she keeps well rented. It seems like, not having anything\r\nelse to amuse her, she turned her big brain to economy and money-making,\r\nand I’ve always thought she did it to hit back at the community. You\r\nsee, the more she makes, the more her less fortunate neighbors dislike\r\nher, and she loves to get even as far as possible.”\r\n\r\n“And has she had no associates at all?” Masters wanted to know.\r\n\r\n“Well, yes, there is one woman, a Mrs. Waycroft, who has always been\r\nintimate with her. She is the only--I started to say she was the only\r\none, but there was a poor mountain fellow, Luke King, a barefoot boy who\r\nhad a fine character, a big brain on him, and no education. His parents\r\nwere poor, and did little for him. They say Mrs. Boyd sort of took pity\r\non him and used to buy books and papers for him, and that she really\r\ntaught him to read and write. She sent him off to school, and got him on\r\nhis feet till he was able to find work in a newspaper office over at\r\nCanton, where he became a boss typesetter. I’ve always thought that her\r\nmisfortune had never quite killed her natural impulses, for she\r\ncertainly got fond of that fellow. I had an exhibition of both his\r\nregard and hers right here at the store. He’d come in to buy something\r\nor other, and was waiting about the stove one cold winter day, when a\r\nbig mountain chap made a light remark about Mrs. Boyd. He was a head\r\ntaller than Luke King was, but the boy sprang at him like a panther and\r\nknocked the fellow down. They had the bloodiest fight I ever saw, and it\r\nwas several minutes before they could be separated. Luke had damaged the\r\nchap pretty badly, but he was able to stand, while the boy keeled over\r\nin a dead faint on the floor, bruised inside some way. The big fellow,\r\nfearing arrest, mounted his horse and went away, and several of us were\r\ndoing what we could with cold water and whiskey to bring the boy around\r\nwhen who should come in but Ann herself. She was passing the store, and\r\nsome one told her about it. People who think she has no heart and is as\r\ncold as stone ought to have seen her that day. In all my life I never\r\nsaw such a terrible face on a human being. I was actually afraid of her.\r\nShe was all fury and all tenderness combined. She looked down at him in\r\nall his blood and bruises and white face, and got down on her knees by\r\nhim. I saw a great big sob rise up in her, although her back was to me,\r\nand shake her from head to foot, and then she was still, simply stroking\r\nback his damp, tangled hair. ‘My poor boy,’ I heard her say, ‘you can’t\r\nfight my battles. God Himself has failed to do that, but I won’t forget\r\nthis--never--never!’”\r\n\r\n“Lord, that was strong!” said Masters. “She must be wonderful!”\r\n\r\n“She is more wonderful than her narrow-minded enemies dream of,”\r\nreturned the storekeeper. “You see, its her pride that keeps her from\r\nshowing her fine feelings, and it’s her secluded life that makes them\r\nmisunderstand her. Well, she brought her wagon and took the boy away.\r\nThat was another queer thing,” Wilson added. “She evidently had started\r\nto take him to her house, for she drove as far as the gate and then\r\nstopped there to study a moment, and finally turned round and drove him\r\nto the poor cabin his folks lived in. You see, she was afraid that even\r\nthat would cause talk, and it would. Old Jane Hemingway would have fed\r\non that morsel for months, as unreasonable as it would have been. Ann\r\nsent a doctor, though, and every delicacy the market afforded, and the\r\nboy was soon out. It wasn’t long afterward that Luke King went to\r\ncollege at Knoxville, and now he’s away in the West somewhere. His\r\nmother, after his father’s death, married a trifling fellow, Mark Bruce,\r\nand that brought on some dispute between her and her son, who had tried\r\nto keep her from marrying such a man. They say Luke told her if she did\r\nmarry Bruce he’d go away and never even write home, and so far, they\r\nsay, he has kept his word. Nobody knows where he is or what he’s doing\r\nunless it is Mrs. Boyd, and she never talks. I can’t keep from thinking\r\nhe’s done well, though, for he had a big head on him and a lot of\r\ndetermination.”\r\n\r\n“And this Mrs. Hemingway, her enemy,” said the drummer tentatively, “you\r\nsay she was evidently the woman’s rival at one time. But it seems she\r\nmarried some one else.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, she suddenly accepted Tom Hemingway, an old bachelor, who had\r\nbeen trying to marry her for a long time. Most people thought she did\r\nit to hide her feelings when Joe Boyd got married. She treated Tom like\r\na dog, making him do everything she wanted, and he was daft about her\r\ntill he died, just a couple of weeks after his child was born, who,\r\nby-the-way, has grown up to be the prettiest girl in all the country,\r\nand that’s another feature in the story,” the storekeeper smiled. “You\r\nsee, Mrs. Boyd looks upon old Jane as the prime cause of her losing her\r\n_own_ child, and I understand she hates the girl as much as she does her\r\nmother.”\r\n\r\nA man had come into the store and stood leaning against a show-case on\r\nthe side devoted to groceries.\r\n\r\n“There’s a customer,” said the drummer; “don’t let me keep you, old man;\r\nyou know you’ve got to look at my samples some time to-day.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll go see what he wants,” said Wilson, “and then I’ll look\r\nthrough your line, though I don’t feel a bit like it, after losing the\r\nbest regular customer I have.”\r\n\r\nThe drummer had opened his sample-case on the desk when Wilson came\r\nback.\r\n\r\n“You say the woman’s husband took the child away,” remarked the drummer;\r\n“did he go far?”\r\n\r\n“They first settled away out in Texas,” replied Wilson, “but Joe Boyd,\r\nnot having his wife’s wonderful head to guide him, failed at farming\r\nthere, and only about three years ago he came back to this country and\r\nbought a little piece of land over in Gilmer--the county that joins this\r\none.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, so near as that! Then perhaps she has seen her daughter and--”\r\n\r\n“Oh no, they’ve never met,” said Wilson, as he took a sample pair of\r\nmen’s suspenders from the case and tested the elastic by stretching it\r\nbetween his hands. “I know that for certain. She was in here one morning\r\nwaiting for one of her teams to pass to take her to Darley, when a\r\npeddler opened his pack of tin-ware and tried to sell her some pieces I\r\nwas out of. He heard me call her by name, and, to be agreeable, he asked\r\nher if she was any kin to Joe Boyd and his daughter, over in Gilmer. I\r\ncould have choked the fool for his stupidity. I tried to catch his eye\r\nto warn him, but he was intent on selling her a bill, and took no notice\r\nof anything else. I saw her stare at him steady for a second or two,\r\nthen she seemed to swallow something, and said, ‘No, they are no kin of\r\nmine.’ And then what did the skunk do but try to make capital out of\r\nthat. ‘Well, you may be glad,’ he said, ‘that they are no kin, for they\r\nare as near the ragged edge as any folks I ever ran across.’ He went on\r\nto say he stayed overnight at Boyd’s cabin and that they had hardly\r\nanything but streak-o’-lean-streak-o’-fat meat and corn-bread to offer\r\nhim, and that the girl had the worst temper he’d ever seen. Mrs. Boyd, I\r\nreckon to hide her face, was looking at some of the fellow’s pans, and\r\nhe seemed to think he was on the right line, and so he kept talking. Old\r\nJoe, he said, had struck him as a good-natured, lazy sort of\r\ncome-easy-go-easy mountaineer, but the girl looked stuck up, like she\r\nthought she was some better than appearances would indicate. He said she\r\nwas a tall, gawky sort of girl, with no good looks to brag of, and he\r\ncouldn’t for the life of him see what she had to make her so proud.\r\n\r\n“I wondered what Mrs. Boyd was going to do, but she was equal to that\r\nemergency, as she always has been in everything. She held one of his\r\npans up in the light and tilted her bonnet back on her head, I thought,\r\nto let me see she wasn’t hiding anything, and said, as unconcerned as if\r\nhe’d never mentioned a delicate subject. ‘Look here,’ she said, thumping\r\nthe bottom of the pan with her finger, ‘if you expect to do any business\r\nwith _me_, you’ll have to bring copper-bottom ware to me. I don’t buy\r\nshoddy stuff from any one. These pans will rust through in two months.\r\nI’ll take half a dozen, but I’m only doing it to pay you for the time\r\nspent on me. It is a bad investment for any one to buy cheap, stamped\r\nware.’”\r\n\r\n  (To be Continued.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWELFTH NIGHT.\r\n\r\n_From Painting by Jan Steen._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwelfth Night.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES J.

E WATSON.\r\n\r\nAndrew Jackson was born on March 15, 1767.\r\n\r\nThere has been a hot dispute over the place of his birth, but the weight\r\nof the legal evidence favors South Carolina.\r\n\r\nHis parents were immigrants from the northern part of Ireland, where the\r\npeople are mainly Presbyterians in religion, and where there is an\r\ninter-mixture of Scotch blood; but there seems to be no positive proof\r\nthat the Jacksons belonged to the over-worked family of Scotch-Irish.\r\n\r\nThey were poor people, living at Carrickfergus, linen weavers by trade,\r\nand, if any one of them had ever been prominent in any way, the story is\r\nlost. The most painstaking researches made by enthusiastic\r\nhero-worshipers have failed to trace the Jackson lineage to a single\r\ncattle-lifting lord, or to any other member of that upper world into\r\nwhich the biographical snob is so eager to cast his anchor.\r\n\r\nThe Jacksons were plain, common, industrious, honest folks, who held a\r\nrespectable, independent place in their own community, but who were not\r\nso prosperous as to resist the temptation to try their fortunes in the\r\nNew World.\r\n\r\nHugh Jackson, brother to Andrew’s father, had been a soldier in a\r\nBritish regiment, and had served in America. He was present at\r\nBraddock’s defeat, and may have known Fausett, the Virginia scout, who\r\nis said to have given the rash British general the wound of which he\r\ndied. (_See note._)\r\n\r\n  _Note_:\r\n\r\n  “The Virginia provincials, under Washington, by their knowledge of\r\n  border warfare, and cool courage, alone saved the day.\r\n\r\n  “Braddock was himself mortally wounded by a provincial named Fausett.\r\n  A brother of the latter had disobeyed the silly orders of the General,\r\n  that the troops should not take position behind the trees, when\r\n  Braddock rode up and struck him down. Fausett who saw the whole\r\n  transaction, immediately drew up his rifle and shot him through the\r\n  lungs.”\r\n\r\n  _“The Great West,” Howe._\r\n\r\nApparently, Hugh Jackson became interested in the efforts of the Catawba\r\nLand Company to colonize its holdings in the Carolinas, for upon his\r\nreturn to Ireland he began to get together a band of kinspeople,\r\nneighbors and friends, for the purpose of emigrating to America.\r\n\r\nAmong those whom Hugh Jackson persuaded was his brother, Andrew. But,\r\nbefore everything could be got ready for the voyage, Hugh Jackson fell\r\nin love with the daughter of well-to-do parents, and married her; and\r\nthe wife of Hugh was so satisfactory in herself and her surroundings\r\nthat the happy husband decided to remain in the old country--his wife\r\nhaving vetoed his emigration scheme.\r\n\r\nHis brother Andrew, however, had probably already made his arrangements\r\nto go to America, and, having got unsettled, found it not so easy to\r\nsink back into his former life; therefore, after some hesitation, he and\r\nthe three Crawfords, one of whom was the husband of his wife’s sister,\r\ntook ship for Charleston.\r\n\r\nUpon his coming to North Carolina, it seems that Andrew Jackson was too\r\npoor to buy land. Instead, therefore, of locating in the Waxhaws\r\nSettlement, where most of the immigrants from Carrickfergus had bought\r\nhomes, he went to Twelve-mile Creek, a branch of the Catawba.\r\n\r\nHere he was seven miles distant from the Waxhaws Settlement, and was\r\nface to face with the gigantic task of carving out a farm from the\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nThe historian, the orator, the painter, have been eager in the duty of\r\nblazoning the deeds of our pioneer missionaries, law-makers and\r\nsoldiers. The names of these heroes live, and deserve to live, in\r\nletters of light upon the records of our country. But, to our pioneer\r\nfarmers, justice has never been done. Theirs was a combat calling for\r\nevery soldierly trait of John Smith and Miles Standish. The patient\r\ncourage which swung the axe, in the depths of primeval woods, was no\r\nless heroic than the bravery which made the musket conquer. The toil of\r\nthe warrior’s march was slight by comparison with the homely, but\r\nexhausting, work of preparing the soil for the sowing of seed. The\r\narrows of the red men were not more deadly to the soldier than were the\r\nfevers which rose from the swamps and pulled down the settler as he\r\nstruggled to open out his farm.\r\n\r\nIn the South, in the East, in the West, the story of the pioneer plowman\r\nof America is one of dauntless courage, of quiet heroism. He found the\r\nNew World a wilderness and he has well-nigh made it a garden. His axe,\r\nhis spade, his hoe, his plow, his muscle, his brain, his very heart and\r\nsoul have all been enlisted in the work; and never once have his lips\r\nuttered the craven’s plea for “Protection.” Never once has he gone to\r\nthe doors of legislation begging special favors. Never once has he lied\r\nto government and people for the purpose of securing a selfish advantage\r\nat the expense of his fellowman.\r\n\r\nNo. He has not only not demanded of the government either Protection or\r\nPrivilege, but he has submitted--yes, for one hundred years he has\r\nsubmitted!--to be robbed of a portion of his annual produce in order\r\nthat our Infant Industry Capitalists should be able to build up the\r\ncorporate power which now, in the form of Trusts, dominates the Republic\r\nand secures the lion’s share of all the wealth created in every field of\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nLike many another pioneer of the American wilderness, Andrew Jackson\r\nfound the task too hard. He died under the strain. The impression which\r\nhis famous son had as to the immediate cause of his death was that he\r\nruptured a blood vessel in the handling of a heavy log.\r\n\r\nThe body of the hero who had fallen in the fight for his wife and little\r\nones--the fight to make a home for them in the wilderness--was buried in\r\nthe graveyard of the Waxhaw Settlement church. In after years, when\r\nefforts were made to identify the spot it could not be done.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAccording to local tradition, there was held at the cabin-home of the\r\ndead man the grewsome “wake” which was customary among the Irish in the\r\nOld Country. Relatives from the Waxhaw settlement came out to Jackson’s\r\n“clearing,” when they learned that he was no more; and, after preparing\r\nthe body for burial, their grief gradually wore itself out, and the\r\nwhiskey-jug became the ruling factor of the occasion. As lamentation\r\ngave place to revelry, it is said that “the corpse came in for his share\r\nof the refreshments.” What this may mean, each reader shall judge for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe same tradition claims that the body was hauled from the cabin to the\r\ngraveyard upon a rough wooden frame or sled, and that such was the\r\ndisorder of the journey that the corpse was jolted off the sled and\r\n“tumbled on its face in a little bottom,” on the banks of Waxhaw Creek,\r\nnear the crossing.\r\n\r\nThe man who was riding the horse, which was hitched to the sled, had not\r\nknown that he had lost his load until one of the funeral party in\r\nadvance, happening to look back, saw “the sled bouncing up and down, in\r\na very light way.”\r\n\r\nThey had to go back miles before they came to the spot where the body\r\nhad rolled off the sled.\r\n\r\nThe numerous biographers of Andrew Jackson have shunned this local\r\ntradition as something entirely too horrible to put in print; yet books\r\nare only valuable to the extent that they tell the truth. The story is\r\nuseful as an illustration of the extreme roughness of frontier\r\nconditions at that time; the poverty of the Jacksons, and the rude\r\nsimplicity of border funerals.\r\n\r\nThe immigrant had gone into the unbroken wilderness to build his log\r\ncabin; and apparently there was no wagon road from his “clearing” to the\r\nWaxhaw Settlement.\r\n\r\nThe use of the wooden frame or sled to carry the body on, would indicate\r\nmore strongly the lack of a road than the lack of a wagon, for, even\r\nthough the Jacksons had no such vehicle, the Waxhaw relatives would have\r\nbrought one if there had been a passable road. The corpse, tumbling off\r\nthe sled and being left behind on its face in the little bottom, is\r\nuncanny, but to the dead the uncanny is not the uncommon.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant soldier--son of the Emperor Charles V--Don John of\r\nAustria, who broke the sea-power of the Turks in the battle of Lepanto,\r\ndied dismally in the Netherlands; and his body was carried on horse-back\r\nto Spain, in two sacks--half of the body in one sack and half in the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nWhen Abraham Lincoln died, his face discolored so rapidly that those in\r\ncharge, to save the feelings of the people who would want to gaze upon\r\nthe revered features, painted out the shocking discoloration; and, thus\r\nartificially masked, the martyred President was borne to his tomb.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe widow Jackson and her two little boys did not go back to the\r\ndistant, lonely cabin on Twelve Mile Creek. From the church-ground where\r\nthe husband and father had been buried, they went to the home of George\r\nMcCamie, who had married Mrs. Jackson’s sister. Here, within a fortnight\r\nof the funeral, a son was born to the widow; and this son she named\r\nAndrew, after his father.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was able to travel, the widow Jackson left the McCamie\r\nhome and went to live with James Crawford, her brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nMrs. Crawford was an invalid, and Mrs. Jackson took charge of the\r\nCrawford housekeeping. Thus she and two of her boys lived for several\r\nyears, the oldest son, Hugh, remaining with George McCamie.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDREW JACKSON.]\r\n\r\nThe family name of Andrew Jackson’s mother was Hutchinson. She had, at\r\nleast, a primary English education, for it was she who taught Andrew to\r\nread. That she was a woman of strong, lovable traits, is proven by the\r\nsound advice she impressed upon the mind of her great son, and by the\r\npassionate attachment to her which he carried throughout his life.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of New Orleans, when the victor had been crowned with\r\nlaurel in the Cathedral and acclaimed like a demi-god through the\r\nstreets, it was of his mother that he spoke to the officers whom he was\r\nabout to disband--their glorious work being done.\r\n\r\n“_Gentlemen, if only_ SHE _could have lived to see this day!_”\r\n\r\nAs you follow the narrative of Andrew Jackson’s career, you will hear\r\nhim say many things that you will not approve, will see him do many\r\nthings which you cannot applaud, but when you recall that at the very\r\ntop-notch of his success and his pride, his heart stayed in the right\r\nplace, and was sore because his mother could not be there to gladden her\r\nold eyes with the glory of her son--you will forgive him much in his\r\nlife that was harsh and cruel and utterly wrong.\r\n\r\nDuring each Winter, for two or three years, after he had reached the age\r\nof seven, Andrew Jackson was sent to the old-field school of a Mr.\r\nBranch. After this, he attended the select school which a Presbyterian\r\npreacher, Dr. David Humphreys, taught in the Waxhaw settlement. He\r\nappears to have been going to this higher school in the spring of 1780,\r\nwhen the inroad of Tarleton created a panic in that portion of the\r\nCarolinas. At some later period of his youth, he is said to have\r\nattended the old Queen College or Seminary at Charlotte a couple of\r\nterms, but the time is not definitely known.\r\n\r\nAs to education, therefore, it may be safely stated that Andrew Jackson\r\nenjoyed much more than the ordinary advantage of a back-woods boy of his\r\ntime. At the age of ten, he had become so good a reader that he was\r\noften chosen to read the newspaper to the assembled neighbors; and he\r\nremembered with pride, in after years, that he had thus had the honor of\r\n“reading out loud” the Declaration of Independence upon its arrival in\r\nthe Waxhaws. For a lad of ten this was, indeed, something to remember\r\nwith honest pride.\r\n\r\nHe also learned to write “a good hand,” which can be easily read even to\r\nthis day: he was well up in arithmetic, and was fond of geography:\r\ngrammar he detested, as most of us did. While yet a school-boy he wrote\r\na composition which was in the nature of a patriotic proclamation,\r\nreminding his countrymen that they must expect occasional defeats and\r\nthat they could hope to win only by steady effort and resolute courage.\r\n\r\nFrom the advent of Tarleton, in 1780, and the Buford Massacre, until the\r\nsurrender of Cornwallis, the widow Jackson and her boys were tossed\r\nhither and thither in the whirlwind of the Revolutionary War. The people\r\nof the Carolinas were divided, as they were in other states, some being\r\nTories and in favor of remaining as subjects of Great Britain, while the\r\nmajority were Whigs, and in favor of Independence.\r\n\r\nThe feud between the two local factions waxed bitter, splitting into\r\nsavage groups almost every neighborhood, and often setting in hostile\r\narray, the one against the other, members of the same family.\r\n\r\nThe troops sent over to this country by King George committed many\r\natrocities, some of which historians have shrunk from recording, but it\r\nis also true that many a nameless horror was perpetrated by our own\r\npeople upon each other. In the later stages of the conflict, almost no\r\nmercy was shown by Tory to Whig, or by Whig to Tory.\r\n\r\nAfter Gates’ disastrous defeat at Camden, Andrew Jackson made his home\r\nfor a while at the house of Mrs. Wilson, a distant connection of Mrs.\r\nJackson. This lady lived a few miles from Charlotte. During his stay\r\nwith her, Andrew made himself useful pulling fodder, going to mill,\r\ndriving the cows to pasture, gathering vegetables for the table,\r\ncarrying in the wood, and taking farm tools to the blacksmith shop to be\r\nmended.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilson had a son who became Andrew Jackson’s playmate and friend;\r\nand this son, who was afterward a prominent minister of the Gospel, used\r\nto relate that whenever young Jackson went to the blacksmith shop he\r\nwould bring back with him some new weapon, spear, club, tomahawk, or\r\ngrass blade with which to kill the British.\r\n\r\nDr. Wilson remembered having told his mother one day, when speaking of\r\nJackson, “Mother, Andy will fight his way in the world.”\r\n\r\nA girl of the neighborhood, who became in due time Mrs. Smart, happened\r\nto see Andrew Jackson as he passed along the road, on his way to the\r\nhome of Mrs. Wilson.\r\n\r\nShe described the lad as being almost a scarecrow. He was riding a\r\nlittle grass-fed pony or colt, which was so small that the long thin\r\nlegs of “the gangling fellow,” Jackson, could almost meet under the\r\nhorse’s belly. The rider wore a wide-brimmed hat which flapped down over\r\nhis face, which was yellow and worn. His figure was covered with dust,\r\nand as this Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance galloped along the road,\r\nhe and his shabby little horse presented the forlornest spectacle that\r\nhad ever greeted the laughing eyes of the girl who was to become known\r\nin Jacksonian annals as Mrs. Susan Smart.\r\n\r\nHugh Jackson, the oldest of the three boys, joined the band of patriots\r\nwhich was raised and equipped, at his own expense, by that noble leader,\r\nColonel William R. Davie, of South Carolina. Only sixteen years of age,\r\nHugh Jackson left the field hospital, where he had been suffering from\r\nfever, and joined in the assault upon Stono Ferry. The excitement, the\r\nexertion, the heat of the day (June 20, 1779), brought on a relapse, and\r\nthe gallant youth died.\r\n\r\nAs to Andrew Jackson, he himself said,\r\n\r\n“Take it altogether, I saw and heard a good deal of war in those days,\r\nbut did nothing toward it myself worth mention.”\r\n\r\nHowever, he further stated that he acted for Colonel Davie as mounted\r\norderly, or messenger, “being a good rider and familiar with all the\r\nroads in those regions.”\r\n\r\nHe witnessed the battles of Hanging Rock and Hobkirk’s Mill, and took\r\npart in a skirmish with the Tories at the house of Captain Sands.\r\n\r\nAndrew and Robert Jackson were taken prisoners, and it was while so held\r\nthat the boys were ordered, Robert first and then Andrew, to clean the\r\nboots of one of Tarleton’s lieutenants. Both refused, and to each was\r\ndealt a savage sabre-cut which had much to do with Robert’s death soon\r\nafterward, and which gave to Andrew a scar and a hatred which he bore to\r\nhis grave.\r\n\r\nTo the rescue of her boys, came Mother Jackson, she who was “as gentle\r\nas a dove and as brave as a lioness.”\r\n\r\nThe lads were so young, and were in such a desperate plight with\r\nsmallpox, that the British officers were perhaps glad to get rid of such\r\nan encumbrance; at any rate they were released or exchanged, and the\r\nforlorn group, the mother and her sick boys, journeyed back to their\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nBut Robert was already so far gone that he died; and when the smallpox\r\nleft Andrew he was a mere skeleton. “It took me all the rest of the year\r\n(1781) to recover my strength and get flesh enough to hide my bones.”\r\n\r\nTo the sacred cause of liberty, Elizabeth Jackson had already given two\r\nof her sons. The third had barely escaped a like fate. But the\r\ngolden-hearted woman was not to be cast down, or taught cowardly\r\nprudence. No sooner was Andrew out of danger, than she sent him to the\r\nhome of Joseph White, another brother-in-law, and set out, herself, to\r\ncarry food and medicine to the sick and wounded patriots who were\r\nconfined in the British hulks in Charleston Harbor.\r\n\r\nBraver, it may be, than the soldier himself is the battlefield nurse who\r\nbrings water to his parched lips, bandages to his bleeding wound, tender\r\nministrations to his dying hours.\r\n\r\nMay it yet come to pass that some time, SOME TIME, in the unfolding of\r\nhigher and better things, these angels of Mercy, the Good Women of the\r\nChristian Nations, may be able to rush in between the lines, as _once_\r\nhappened in the days of old, and stay the hands lifted to shed human\r\nblood!\r\n\r\nElizabeth Jackson, in the spirit of consecration, went to what seemed to\r\nher the post of duty, thinking nothing of the cost to herself.\r\n\r\nThey were in prison--her neighbors, friends, compatriots--and she did\r\nvisit them. She brought to the suffering prisoners words of comfort;\r\nmessages from home; the motherly sympathy which heals like a balsam; the\r\nkind word which is sweeter than myrrh.\r\n\r\nThen the ministering angel, the best of all created things, a good\r\nwoman, passed out of the ship, carrying with her the deadly fever which\r\nknew no difference betwixt the good and the bad. After a brief illness\r\nshe died, and she was buried near Charleston; but, like her husband, her\r\ndust lies in a grave that cannot be found.\r\n\r\nAfter the loss of his mother (in the fall of 1781), Andrew Jackson\r\nremained with Joseph White, a saddler by trade, helping him in his shop,\r\nin the making and mending of saddles and harness. At the same time, he\r\nread everything he could lay his hands on--books, pamphlets and\r\nnewspapers. His uncle’s father was a local magistrate, possessed of a\r\nbook of law forms and rules of common practice. Most young men would lay\r\nsuch a book underneath a volume of Sermons, and then spread a layer of\r\ndust over both; but Andrew Jackson afterward said that he read and\r\nre-read the law book until he knew it by heart.\r\n\r\nBut at this period in his growth an unfortunate thing happened. The\r\ndeath of his father and his brothers had left Andrew Jackson the\r\nheir-at-law to a considerable part of the estate of Hugh Jackson, of\r\nCarrickfergus, his grandfather.\r\n\r\nThe amount, some fifteen hundred or two thousand dollars, was just about\r\nenough to unsettle the average young man, jostling him out of the\r\nroutine of dull, monotonous industry--saddle-mending, for example.\r\n\r\nThe legal representative of the Hugh Jackson estate, in America, was the\r\nWilliam Barton, of Charleston, at whose house Elizabeth Jackson had\r\ndied. Why it was that he turned over the money to the young man before\r\nhe became of age is not explained. Perhaps Andrew wanted the money, and\r\nhad made up his mind to get it. If so, the conduct of Barton is\r\ncomprehensible. Whenever Andrew Jackson wanted a thing and made up his\r\nmind to get it, he could become a most troublesome customer. At all\r\nevents, Mr. Barton paid over the money to the boy, and the boy sowed\r\nwild oats with it.\r\n\r\nHe bought a fine horse, and fine equipments for the horse; he bought\r\nfine raiment for his own person, including a gold watch; he bought a\r\nfine pair of pistols, so that he would be ready in case it became\r\ndesirable to shoot somebody. In short, he went to going all the gaits of\r\na fast young man, until his money was gone.\r\n\r\nAt the last, he made a bet which would have swept away even his horse,\r\nhad he lost; but luck favored him; he won; and it is a convincing proof\r\nof his inborn good sense that he immediately paid up his debts, and rode\r\nhis fine horse away from Charleston and its allurements.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSTUDYING LAW!\r\n\r\nTo that stage had Andrew Jackson came, in 1785, steered by the unseen\r\nforces which govern the world. It is doubtful whether he himself could\r\nhave explained how he happened to drift into that profession rather than\r\nsome other.\r\n\r\nIn the finding of one’s life-work there is much more of feeling around\r\nin the dark than is generally supposed. Cervantes did not begin to write\r\nDon Quixote until he had tried success by many routes, and had landed on\r\nthe wrong side of a prison door. Bacon’s best work was done after his\r\ndisgrace as an officer of state and after Queen Elizabeth had expressed\r\nthe weighty opinion that he didn’t know much law.\r\n\r\nOliver Goldsmith, the neglected physician, wrote “The Deserted Village”\r\nand “The Vicar of Wakefield” after he had waited in vain for patients\r\nbringing fees.\r\n\r\nHad Napoleon been a success as an author, he might never have meddled\r\nwith politics.\r\n\r\nHad General Lew Wallace been a success as a soldier, he might never have\r\nwritten “Ben Hur.”\r\n\r\nHad U. S. Grant been a money-maker at the outbreak of the Civil War, he\r\nmight never have commanded on the winning side at Appomattox.\r\n\r\nHad Sam Houston been able to wear with credit the harness of social and\r\npolitical existence in Tennessee, he might never have thrown himself\r\namid the wilder men of the Southwest and won fame as a builder of\r\nempire!\r\n\r\nPatrick Henry’s failure in other fields shunted him into the legal\r\nprofession; and Jefferson’s partial failure as a lawyer became a\r\nstepping-stone into the higher calling of practical statesmanship.\r\n\r\nHappy is the man who can find out, early in life, the work which he is\r\nbest fitted to do. Among the most pitiable of the wretched is he who\r\ngrows old at a task which, too late, he learns was not set for _him_.\r\n\r\nThe gray-haired school-teacher or commonplace preacher, who realizes\r\nthat he should have been a merchant, lawyer, doctor or civil engineer,\r\nis pathetic. To know what to try to do is the great problem, and it may\r\nbe that even the men who succeed in their chosen calling could have\r\nrendered mankind better service in some other field.\r\n\r\nHenry Brougham’s shrewd old mother bewailed his quitting the House of\r\nCommons to don the robes of Lord Chancellor: Dr. Samuel Johnson lamented\r\nthe fate which never gave him a chance to try his hand in Parliament:\r\nEdmund Burke writhed under Goldsmith’s famous lashing of him “who to\r\nparty gave up what was meant for mankind.”\r\n\r\nWhat is it that draws the most ambitious men of modern times into “the\r\nstudy of law”?\r\n\r\nThe reward, of course. All things considered, no other profession offers\r\nso great a return upon the investment of time, talent and industry.\r\n\r\nWhile the nations are standing in arms, clothed in steel from head to\r\nfoot, the purpose is not so much to fight as to discourage attack from\r\nwithout and insurrection from within. The standing army gives the\r\neducation whose watchword is “_Obey!_” It cultivates the class-pride and\r\nprejudice upon which caste rule is built. It interests millions of\r\ncitizens in the maintenance of “Law and Order”--the law which imposes\r\nthe yoke of the ruling caste and the order which restrains its victims\r\nfrom revolt.\r\n\r\nThe military profession, therefore, is one which irresistibly attracts\r\nvery many aspirants to influence, to position, to power; but even the\r\nmilitary profession does not win over so many ambitious young men as\r\ndoes “the study of the law.”\r\n\r\nIn the building up of our civilization we have complicated matters to\r\nsuch an extent that the lawyer is indispensable, almost omnipotent.\r\n\r\nDoes the layman know anything about his own rights as a citizen? Very\r\nlittle. Upon the simplest things only is he informed. At every turn he\r\nfinds himself under the necessity of getting help from the lawyer. Great\r\nis the corporation--the bank, the railroad, the trust--but the\r\ncorporation dares not move a step without a lawyer in the pilot-house.\r\n\r\nFrom the Justice’s Court in the rural district and the Mayor’s Court in\r\nthe village, all the way up to Presidential policies and Governmental\r\nproblems, the lawyer is the doctor who must be called in to look at the\r\ntongue of the difficulty, and to write out a prescription.\r\n\r\nIn the business world the lawyer levies his tribute upon the great and\r\nthe small, the rich and the poor, the hayseed farmer and the silk-hat\r\nfinancier.\r\n\r\nOur Wall Street Money-Kings would no more think of organizing a rascally\r\nscheme of High Finance without the help of lawyers than the buccaneers\r\nof old would have thought of flying the pirate flag without guns on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nIn the political world the lawyer is omnipresent, indispensable.\r\n\r\nWho organizes the Machine and steers the Boss on his cruise, keeping him\r\noff the reefs and bars of the Criminal Code?\r\n\r\nThe lawyer.\r\n\r\nWho maps out the campaign, devises a fraud upon the people which the\r\nstatute cannot quite reach, and then, after the election has been stolen\r\nfrom the people, shows the Boss how to keep the stolen goods in defiance\r\nof right and in spite of the legal proceedings?\r\n\r\nThe lawyer.\r\n\r\nWho is it that the beneficiaries of class-legislation naturally select\r\nto advance their claims, voice their demands, guard their interests in\r\nthe legislatures of states, in the Congress of the United States, in the\r\nCabinet of the President?\r\n\r\nThe lawyer.\r\n\r\nUnder our system, so complex has it become, the man who wants to do\r\nright doesn’t know how. Except in the simplest transactions, a lawyer\r\nmust show him how. If, on the contrary, a bad man wants to do wrong, but\r\nwants to escape punishment, he needs, and can generally get, a lawyer to\r\nshow him the way.\r\n\r\nThe innocent man, accused of crime, needs a lawyer; is not safe without\r\none, and may be convicted, even then, if he happens to employ a sorry\r\none, who can be outwitted by the prosecution.\r\n\r\nThe guilty man, accused of crime, needs a lawyer; is not safe without\r\none; and if he employs a good one, while the prosecution is managed by a\r\nsorry one, the jury may be forced to turn him loose, although they feel\r\nthat he is “as guilty as a dog.”\r\n\r\nThus, looked at from the standpoint of mere ambition, sordid\r\nselfishness, the “study of law” powerfully attracts young men who want\r\nto get on in the world.\r\n\r\nBut there is another point of view--thank God!\r\n\r\nIt is not every student of Blackstone or Coke who licks his chops, by\r\nanticipation, over the sweets of mental prostitution.\r\n\r\nIt is not every student of the law who means to become the jackal to the\r\nlion, the doer of dirty work for hire, the seller of divinely fashioned\r\ngenius to the highest bidder--with the morals of a harlot, without that\r\nexcuse of dire necessity which the harlot can often give.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the boy who comes to the study of the law is actuated by\r\nnobler motives, a higher purpose. A generous ambition to gain knowledge,\r\nto fit himself for a leader’s place among men, to arm himself with the\r\nweapons which enable him to fight the battles of the weak and to defend\r\nthe right against the wrong, find place in his mind and heart, just as\r\nthey do in the beautiful language of the oath which he must take.\r\n\r\nAlmost in the very words--and quite in the identical spirit--that\r\nancient Chivalry solemnly swore the Knight-Errant to his duty, pledging\r\nhim to champion the cause of the weak and the oppressed, the oath of\r\noffice consecrates the young lawyer to his work by the same holy vows.\r\nFor it must be remembered that no profession has a more glorious\r\ntradition and heritage than that of the law.\r\n\r\nThe Crusaders who have in modern times gone forth to redeem the Holy\r\nSepulchre of Truth from the Infidel have been led, by whom?\r\n\r\nThe lawyer.\r\n\r\nThe Knight-Errant who rode forth, panoplied in burnished steel, to break\r\nthe chains, lift the yoke, batter down the prison door of the captive,\r\nthe weak, the oppressed, has been, whom?\r\n\r\nThe lawyer.\r\n\r\nGreat was Mirabeau, but he dreamt only of changing France into a\r\nconstitutional monarchy, leaving Divine Right on the throne and\r\nhereditary Privilege in force.\r\n\r\nIt was Danton, the lawyer, who led _the Revolution_, and sketched the\r\nDemocratic state, in which all the people should rule for the benefit of\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIt was the lawyer who led in the long, hard fight for Civil liberty in\r\nEngland; the lawyer who slew the monsters of her Criminal Code; the\r\nlawyer who armed the private citizen with school-book and ballot.\r\n\r\nIt was the lawyer who pleaded Ireland’s cause at the bar of Public\r\nOpinion, wrung from British intolerance Religious Freedom, compelled the\r\nrecognition of the Irishman’s rights in Irish land, and so won upon the\r\nconscience and the fear of the ruling caste that the triumph of the\r\nCause of Ireland has become a question of time rather than a matter of\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nIn our own history, whose record is better than that of the lawyer?\r\n\r\nWould our forefathers ever have gone to war with Great Britain had they\r\nawaited the lead of Benjamin Franklin, John Dickinson and George\r\nWashington?\r\n\r\n_Never in the world._\r\n\r\nNot until Patrick Henry and Dabney Carr and Thomas Jefferson and James\r\nOtis and John Adams and Alexander Hamilton, _the hot-headed young\r\nlawyers_, had fired the woods, and the flames were leaping onward with a\r\nrush which none could stop, did those more cautious and conservative\r\ncitizens, Franklin, Dickinson and Washington, commit themselves to the\r\nmovement of the Colonies against the Mother Country.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer lit the signal fires of that Revolution, the lawyer wrote the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, the lawyer framed the Constitution, the\r\nlawyer organized the Government. The lawyer struck down Feudalism in\r\nAmerica, wrote the statute for Religious Liberty, swung wide the doors\r\nof individual opportunity, and forged, ready for use, every weapon\r\nagainst tyranny which a free people need to protect themselves from\r\noppression.\r\n\r\nEven at that early period there was another side to the shield, not so\r\nbright as that which I have presented, but, throughout the Revolutionary\r\nEra, the patriotic service of the lawyer was so splendidly conspicuous\r\nthat the reverse side of the shield was as the spot on the sun.\r\n\r\nWhen Andrew Jackson rode into Salisbury, N. C. (1785), and put up at the\r\nRowan House, the old-fashioned tavern, he was eighteen years old, and\r\nhad already gone to the school of experience, to an extent which few of\r\nhis future competitors for national honor had equaled.\r\n\r\nHis boyhood had breathed in the hot atmosphere of war. The sound of\r\nmusketry, of rifle fire, of cannon play, had been familiar to his ear.\r\nThe sight of bloodshed, scenes of carnage, the ruthless deeds of Tory\r\nhate and Whig revenge had burnt their impressions upon mind and heart.\r\nThe dangers amid which he had lived, the hardships which he had endured,\r\nthe lust of victory and the panic of defeat, the sudden flight from the\r\ndeadly attack, the narrow escape from awful death, the loss of his\r\nbrothers and mother, the imprisonment and maltreatment of himself, the\r\nwild disorders and appalling cruelties of foreign invasion added to\r\nCivil strife--all these things were factors in the molding of Andrew\r\nJackson.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered the office of Spruce McCay to read law under that\r\ninfluential attorney, he had already given evidence of the traits of\r\ncharacter which afterward made him one of the best loved and best hated\r\nmen that ever lived.\r\n\r\nIt had already been shown that he would fight at the drop of a hat; that\r\nhe was headstrong, impatient of contradiction, and overbearing. Weaker\r\nboys who turned to him for protection got it. He would “take up” for the\r\nsmall boy, and, if need were, wage his battle. He was high-tempered,\r\nquick as powder, hard to get along with--and the boy who laughed at him\r\nbecause he had what was called “a slobber mouth” had to run or fight.\r\n\r\nHe had shown that he was fond of outdoor life, outdoor sport games, and\r\nrecreations. He loved to hunt, was a good shot, an expert horseman and\r\nrode admirably, excelled in running and jumping. Some say that even when\r\nthrown by a stronger man he “wouldn’t stay throwed”; others relate that\r\nJohn Lewis could out-jump him and throw him down; and that when John\r\nLewis threw him, Andy _did_ “stay throwed.” That he was believed to have\r\na generous nature is proven by the fact that he is said to have been a\r\ngreat friend to this same John Lewis.\r\n\r\nThe eighteen-year old Jackson had already shown his fondness for\r\ngambling at cards, on chicken fights and horse races, on the throw of a\r\ndicebox, on almost any sort of game or contest. He was known also as a\r\nwild young fellow who would drink too much whisky, indulge in too many\r\ncoarse practical jokes, and who, when inflamed by anger, could out-curse\r\nanybody in all the regions round about.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay of two years in Salisbury Jackson’s character continued\r\nto unfold itself along those lines. He was not much of a student; it is\r\nnot recorded that he did any office work for Spruce McCay; nor does any\r\nbiographer explain how it was that he paid for his board and lodging.\r\n\r\nIt seems that he kept his horse, and that he was active in horse-racing,\r\ncock-fighting, card-playing circles; but it is not probable that he\r\nrelied upon his winnings to pay his way.\r\n\r\nHow, then, did he do it?\r\n\r\nPerhaps his work as school-teacher should be assigned to this period of\r\nhis life, and it is possible that some remnant of his legacy may have\r\ntided him over.\r\n\r\nIllustrative of the rougher side of his character is the practical joke\r\nwhich he played upon the eminent respectabilities of Salisbury by\r\nsending cards of invitation to the Christmas ball to two notorious\r\nstrumpets of the town. The unclean birds came to the ball, as per Andrew\r\nJackson’s cards, and the uproar in the fowl-house was considerable. But\r\nAndy was a great favorite with the ladies--as “wild” young men have ever\r\nbeen--and he succeeded in getting rid of the disturbers and at the same\r\ntime holding the admiration of the eminently respectable.\r\n\r\nAnother anecdote of the period represents him engaged with boon\r\ncompanions in a carousal, which lasted throughout the night and wound up\r\nwith a general smashing of all the furniture in the room.\r\n\r\nA flood of light is poured upon his standing with the “unco’ good and\r\nrigidly righteous” at this time by the exclamation of the old lady of\r\nSalisbury, who, on being told, forty years later, that Andrew Jackson\r\nwas a candidate for President, cried out:\r\n\r\n“What! Jackson up for President? _Jackson?_ _Andrew_ Jackson? The\r\nJackson that used to live in Salisbury? Why, when he was here, he was\r\nsuch a rake that my husband would not bring him into the house! It is\r\ntrue, he _might_ have taken him out to the stable to weigh horses for a\r\nrace, and might drink a glass of whisky with him _there_. Well, if\r\nAndrew Jackson can be President, anybody can.”\r\n\r\nFrom the office of Judge Spruce McCay Jackson went to that of Colonel\r\nJohn Stokes, where he continued his studies until he thought himself\r\nready for admission to the Bar. In the spring of 1787 he applied for and\r\nreceived his license to practice law.\r\n\r\nFor a year after his admission to the Bar he appears to have lived at a\r\nvillage in Martinsville, N. C., where two friends of his kept a store.\r\nTradition says that he helped them in running the business, and that he\r\naccepted a local position as constable or deputy-sheriff. At any rate,\r\nhe realized soon that he was gaining no foothold in North Carolina, and\r\nhe made up his mind to try his fortune in the new country beyond the\r\nmountains, where Robertson and Donelson and Sevier were planting the\r\nbeginning of another state on the Cumberland.\r\n\r\nBefore we follow Jackson into Tennessee, let us pause “to take his\r\npicture.”\r\n\r\nHe was tall and slender--standing six feet and one inch in height.\r\nCarrying himself straight as a ramrod, and stepping with a quick,\r\nspringing clearlift walk, he made the impression upon the observer that\r\nhe was as active as a cat--lithe, sinewy, tough, and with not a lazy\r\nbone in his body.\r\n\r\nHe had a shock of red hair, and a pair of fine blue eyes, which rested\r\nunwinkingly upon one in conversation, and which blazed when he was\r\naroused. His face was sallow, freckled, long, thin, angular, with a\r\nfighting jaw.\r\n\r\nHis bearing toward men was open, frank, confident, self-assertive.\r\n\r\nToward women he was deferential, most attentive and polite. Surprising\r\nas it may seem, there is no room for doubt that Andrew Jackson’s manner\r\ntoward ladies was from the first, captivating to a marked degree. By the\r\ntime he reached the age of eighteen he had developed a taste for good\r\ndressing. The same trait which led him to want the finest-looking horse,\r\nthe richest caparison, the best pistols and guns, the best dogs and game\r\nchickens, led him to choose for himself a style of wearing apparel, both\r\nin the material and the make, which was far above the average of the\r\nbackwoods.\r\n\r\nSome of his lady friends went to the courthouse the day he was examined\r\nfor admission to the Bar, and one of these has left a description of him\r\nas he then appeared.\r\n\r\nThose who recall Albert Gallatin’s statement that Jackson, when in\r\nCongress, looked and dressed like an uncouth backwoodsman may not be\r\nable to reconcile his testimony with that of Mrs. Anne Rutherford, who\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n“He always dressed neat and tidy, and carried himself as if he was a\r\nrich man’s son.\r\n\r\n“The day he was licensed he had on a new suit, with a broadcloth coat,\r\nruffled shirt, and other garments in the best of fashion.”\r\n\r\nThere is no disputing about taste; and the reader is left to the\r\nconclusion that a style of dressing which appeared to be the best of\r\nfashion to a country girl of North Carolina may have seemed “irregular”\r\nto such a cosmopolitan gentleman as Gallatin.\r\n\r\nThe red breeches of Thomas Jefferson had been “the best of fashion” in\r\nParis, but when he wore them in New York, as a member of Washington’s\r\nCabinet, social rumblings were heard and social upheavals feared.\r\n\r\n  (To be Continued.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Blue Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY PROSPER MERIMEE.\r\n\r\nA young man was walking up and down the waiting room of a railway\r\nstation, in an agitated condition. He wore blue spectacles, and,\r\nalthough he had not a cold, he used his pocket-handkerchief incessantly.\r\nHe held a little black bag in his left hand which, as I learned later,\r\ncontained a silk dressing-gown and a pair of Turkish pantaloons.\r\n\r\nEvery now and again he went to the door and looked into the street, then\r\nhe drew out his watch and consulted the station clock. The train did not\r\nleave for an hour; but there are people who always imagine they will be\r\nlate. This train was not for people in a pressing hurry; there were very\r\nfew first-class carriages in it. It was not an hour at which\r\nstock-brokers left, after business was finished, to go to their country\r\nhomes for dinner. When travellers began to appear, a Parisian would have\r\nrecognized from their bearing that they were either farmers, or small\r\nsuburban tradesmen. Nevertheless, every time anyone came into the\r\nstation, or a carriage drew up at the door, the heart of the young man\r\nwith the blue spectacles became inflated like a balloon, his knees\r\ntrembled, his bag almost fell from his hands, and his glasses off his\r\nnose, where, we may mention in passing, they were seated crookedly.\r\n\r\nHis agitation increased when, after a long wait, a woman appeared by a\r\nside door, from precisely the direction in which he had kept a constant\r\nlookout. She was dressed in black with a thick veil over her face, and\r\nshe held a brown morocco leather bag in her hand, containing, as I\r\nsubsequently discovered, a wondrous morning-gown and blue satin\r\nslippers. The woman and the young man advanced towards each other\r\nlooking to right and left, but never in front of them. They came up to\r\none another, shook hands, and stood several minutes without speaking a\r\nword, trembling and gasping, a prey to one of those intense emotions for\r\nwhich I would give in exchange a hundred years of a philosopher’s life.\r\n\r\n“Leon,” said the young woman, when she had summoned up courage to speak\r\n(I had forgotten to mention that she was young and pretty)--“Leon, what\r\na happy thought! I should never have recognized you with those blue\r\nspectacles.”\r\n\r\n“What a happy thought!” said Leon. “I should never have known you under\r\nthat black veil.”\r\n\r\n“What a happy thought!” she repeated. “Let us be quick to take our\r\nseats; suppose the train were to start without us!...” (and she squeezed\r\nhis arm tightly). “No one will suspect us. I am now with Clara and her\r\nhusband, on the way to their country house, where, _tomorrow_, I must\r\nsay good-bye to her; ... and,” she added, laughing and lowering her\r\nhead, “she left an hour ago; and tomorrow, ... after passing _the last\r\nevening_ with her, ... (again she pressed his arm), tomorrow in the\r\nmorning, she will leave me at the station, where I shall meet Ursula,\r\nwhom I sent on ahead to my aunt’s.... Oh! I have arranged everything.\r\nLet us take our tickets.... They cannot possibly guess who we are. Oh!\r\nsuppose they ask our names at the inn? I have forgotten them\r\nalready....”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur and Madame Duru.”\r\n\r\n“Oh no! Not Duru. There was a shoemaker called that at the pension.”\r\n\r\n“Dumont, then?”\r\n\r\n“Daumont.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. But no one will ask us.”\r\n\r\nThe bell rang, the door of the waiting-room opened, and the carefully\r\nveiled young woman rushed into a carriage with her youthful companion.\r\nThe bell rang a second time, and the door of their compartment was\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\n“We are alone!” they exclaimed delightedly.\r\n\r\nBut, almost at the same moment, a man of about fifty, dressed completely\r\nin black, with a grave and bored expression, entered the carriage and\r\nsettled himself in a corner. The engine whistled, and the train began to\r\nmove. The two young people drew back as far as they could from their\r\nunwelcome neighbor and began to whisper in English as an additional\r\nprecaution.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said the other traveller, in the same tongue, and with a\r\nmuch purer British accent, “if you have secrets to tell each other, you\r\nhad better not tell them in English before me, for I am an Englishman. I\r\nam extremely sorry to annoy you; but there was only a single man in the\r\nother compartment, and I make it a rule never to travel alone with one\r\nman only.... He had the face of a Judas and this might have tempted\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nHe pointed to his travelling-bag, which he had thrown before him on the\r\ncushion.\r\n\r\n“But I shall read if I do not go to sleep.”\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, he did make a gallant effort to sleep. He opened his bag,\r\ndrew out a comfortable cap, put it on his head, and kept his eyes shut\r\nfor several minutes; then he reopened them with a gesture of impatience,\r\nsearched in his bag for his spectacles, then for a Greek book. At length\r\nhe settled himself to read, with an air of deep attention. While getting\r\nhis book out of the bag he displaced many things piled up hap-hazard.\r\nAmong others, he drew out of the depths of the bag a large bundle of\r\nBank of England notes, placed it on the seat opposite him, and, before\r\nputting it back in the bag, he showed it to the young man, and asked him\r\nif there was a place in N---- where he could change banknotes.\r\n\r\n“Probably, as it is on the route to England.”\r\n\r\nN---- was the place to which the young people were going. There is quite\r\na tidy little hotel at N----, where people seldom stop except on\r\nSaturday evenings. It is held out that the rooms are good, but the host\r\nand his helpers are far enough away from Paris to indulge in this\r\nprovincial vice. The young man whom I have already called by the name of\r\nLeon, had been recommended to this hotel some time previously, when he\r\nwas minus blue spectacles, and, upon his recommendation, his companion\r\nand friend had seemed desirous of visiting it.\r\n\r\nShe was, moreover, at that time in such a condition of mind that the\r\nwalls of a prison would have seemed delightful, if they had enclosed\r\nLeon with her.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the train journeyed on; the Englishman read his Greek\r\nbook, without looking towards his companions, who conversed in that low\r\ntone that only lovers can hear. Perhaps I shall not astonish my readers\r\nwhen I tell them that these two were lovers in the fullest acceptation\r\nof the term, and what was still more deplorable, they were not married,\r\nbecause there were reasons which placed an obstacle in the way of their\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nThey reached N----, and the Englishman got out first. Whilst Leon helped\r\nhis friend to descend from the carriage without showing her legs, a man\r\njumped on to the platform from the next compartment. He was pale, even\r\nsallow; his eyes were sunken and bloodshot, and his beard unkempt, a\r\nsign by which great criminals are often detected. His dress was clean,\r\nbut worn almost threadbare. His coat, once black, but now grey at the\r\nback and by the elbows, was buttoned up to his chin, probably to hide a\r\nwaistcoat still more shabby. He went up to the Englishman and put on a\r\ndeferential tone.\r\n\r\n“Uncle!” he said.\r\n\r\n“Leave me alone, you wretch!” cried the Englishman, whose grey eyes\r\nflashed with anger; and he took a step forward to leave the station.\r\n\r\n“Don’t drive me to despair,” replied the other, with a piteous and yet\r\nat the same time menacing accent.\r\n\r\n“Will you be good enough to hold my bag for a moment?” said the old\r\nEnglishman, throwing his travelling-bag at Leon’s feet.\r\n\r\nHe then took the man who had accosted him by the arm, and led, or rather\r\npushed, him into a corner, where he hoped they would not be overheard,\r\nand there he seemed to address him roughly for a moment. He then drew\r\nsome papers from his pocket, crumpled them up, and put them in the hand\r\nof the man who had called him uncle. The latter took the papers without\r\noffering any thanks, and almost immediately took himself off and\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nAs there is but one hotel in N---- it was not surprising that, after a\r\nshort interval, all the characters of this veracious story met together\r\nthere. In France every traveller who has the good fortune to have a\r\nwell-dressed wife on his arm is certain to obtain the best room in any\r\nhotel; so firmly is it believed that we are the politest nation in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIf the bedroom that was assigned to Leon was the best, it would be rash\r\nto conclude that it was perfect. It had a great walnut bedstead, with\r\nchintz curtains, on which was printed in violet the magic story of\r\nPyramis and Thisbe. The walls were covered with a colored paper\r\nrepresenting a view of Naples and a multitude of people; unfortunately,\r\nidle and impertinent visitors had drawn moustaches and pipes to all the\r\nfigures, both male and female, and many silly things had been scribbled\r\nin lead-pencil in rhyme and prose on the sky and ocean. Upon this\r\nbackground hung several engravings: “Louis Philippe taking the Oath of\r\nthe Charter of 1830,” “The first Interview between Julia and\r\nSaint-Preux,” “Waiting for Happiness,” and “Regrets,” after M. Dubuffe.\r\nThis room was called the Blue Chamber, because the two arm-chairs to\r\nleft and right of the fireplace were upholstered in Utrecht velvet of\r\nthat color; but for a number of years they had been covered with\r\nwrappers of grey glazed calico edged with red braid.\r\n\r\nWhilst the hotel servants crowded round the new arrival and offered\r\ntheir services, Leon, who, although in love, was not destitute of common\r\nsense, went to order dinner. It required all his eloquence and various\r\nkinds of bribes to extract the promise of a dinner by themselves alone.\r\nGreat was his dismay when he learnt that in the principal dining-room,\r\nwhich was next his room, the officers of the 3rd Hussars, who were about\r\nto relieve the officers of the 3rd Chasseurs at N----, were going to\r\njoin at a farewell dinner that very day, which would be a lively affair.\r\nThe host swore by all his gods that, except a certain amount of gaiety\r\nwhich was natural to every French soldier, the officers of the Hussars\r\nand Chasseurs were known throughout the town for their gentlemanly and\r\ndiscreet behavior, and that their proximity would not inconvenience\r\nmadam in the least; the officers were in the habit of rising from table\r\nbefore midnight.\r\n\r\nAs Leon went back to the Blue Chamber but slightly reassured, he noticed\r\nthat the Englishman occupied the other room next his. The door was open,\r\nand the Englishman sat at a table upon which were a glass and a bottle.\r\nHe was looking at the ceiling with profound attention, as though he were\r\ncounting the flies walking on it.\r\n\r\n“What matter if they are so near,” said Leon to himself. “The Englishman\r\nwill soon be tipsy, and the Hussars will leave before midnight.”\r\n\r\nOn entering the Blue Chamber his first care was to make sure that the\r\ncommunicating doors were tightly locked, and that they had bolts to\r\nthem. There were double doors on the Englishman’s side, and the walls\r\nwere thick. The partition was thinner on the Hussars’ side, but the door\r\nhad a lock and a bolt. After all, this was a more effectual barrier to\r\ncuriosity than the blinds of a carriage, and how many people think they\r\nare hidden from the world in a hackney carriage!\r\n\r\nAssuredly the most opulent imagination could certainly never have\r\npictured a more complete state of happiness than that of these two young\r\nlovers, who, after waiting so long, found themselves alone and far away\r\nfrom jealous and prying eyes, preparing to relate their past sufferings\r\nat their ease and to taste the delights of a perfect reunion. But the\r\ndevil always finds out a way to pour his drop of wormwood into the cup\r\nof happiness.\r\n\r\nJohnson was not the first who wrote--he took it from a Greek\r\nwriter--that no man could say, “Today I shall be happy.” This truth was\r\nrecognized at a very remote period by the greatest philosophers, and\r\nyet is ignored by a certain number of mortals, and especially by most\r\nlovers.\r\n\r\nWhilst taking a poorly served dinner in the Blue Chamber from some\r\ndishes filched from the Hussars’ and the Chasseurs’ banquet, Leon and\r\nhis lover were much disturbed by the conversation in which the gentlemen\r\nin the neighboring room were engaged. They held forth on abstruse\r\nsubjects concerning strategy and tactics, which I shall refrain from\r\nrepeating.\r\n\r\nThere were a succession of wild stories--nearly all of them broad and\r\naccompanied by shrieks of laughter, in which it was often difficult for\r\nour lovers not to join. Leon’s friend was no prude; but there are things\r\none prefers not to hear, particularly during a tete-a-tete with the man\r\none loves. The situation became more and more embarrassing, and when\r\nthey were taking in the officers’ dessert, Leon felt he must go\r\ndownstairs to beg the host to tell the gentlemen that he had an invalid\r\nwife in the room adjoining theirs, and they would deem it a matter of\r\ncourtesy if a little less noise were made.\r\n\r\nThe noise was nothing out of the way for a regimental dinner, and the\r\nhost was taken aback and did not know what to reply. Just when Leon gave\r\nhis message for the officers, a waiter asked for champagne for the\r\nHussars, and a maidservant for port wine for the Englishman.\r\n\r\n“I told him there was none,” she added.\r\n\r\n“You are a fool. I have every kind of wine. I will go and find him some.\r\nPort is it? Bring me the bottle of ratafia, a bottle of quince and a\r\nsmall decanter of brandy.”\r\n\r\nWhen the host had concocted the port in a trice, he went into the large\r\ndining-room to execute Leon’s commission, which at first roused a\r\nfurious storm.\r\n\r\nThen a deep voice, which dominated all the others, asked what kind of a\r\nwoman their neighbor was. There was a brief silence before the host\r\nreplied--\r\n\r\n“Really, gentlemen, I do not know how to answer you. She is very pretty\r\nand very shy. Marie-Jeanne says she has a wedding ring on her finger.\r\nShe is probably a bride come here on her honeymoon, as so many others\r\ncome here.”\r\n\r\n“A bride?” exclaimed forty voices. “She must come and clink glasses with\r\nus! We will drink to her health and teach the husband his conjugal\r\nduties!”\r\n\r\nAt these words there was a great jingling of spurs, and our lovers\r\ntrembled, fearing that their room was about to be taken by storm. All at\r\nonce a voice was raised which stopped the manœuvre. It evidently\r\nbelonged to a commanding officer. He reproached the officers with their\r\nwant of politeness, ordered them to sit down again and to talk decently,\r\nwithout shouting. Then he added some words too low to be heard in the\r\nBlue Chamber. He was listened to with deference, but, nevertheless, not\r\nwithout exciting a certain amount of covert hilarity. From that moment\r\nthere was comparative quiet in the officers’ room; and our lovers,\r\nblessing the salutary reign of discipline, began to talk together with\r\nmore freedom.... But after such confusion it was a little time before\r\nthey regained that peace of mind which anxiety, the worries of\r\ntravelling, and, worse than all, the loud merriment of their neighbors,\r\nhad so greatly agitated. This was not very difficult to accomplish,\r\nhowever, at their age, and they had very soon forgotten all the troubles\r\nof their adventurous expedition in thinking of its more important\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nThey thought peace was declared with the Hussars. Alas! it was but a\r\ntruce. Just when they expected it least, when they were a thousand\r\nleagues away from this sublunary world, twenty-four trumpets, supported\r\nby several trombones, struck up the air well known to French soldiers,\r\n“La victoire est nous!” How could anyone withstand such a tempest? The\r\npoor lovers might well complain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut they had not much longer to complain, for at the end the officers\r\nleft the dining-room, filed past the door of the Blue Chamber with a\r\ngreat clattering of spurs and sabres, and shouted one after the other--\r\n\r\n“Good night, madam bride!”\r\n\r\nThen all noise ceased. No, I am mistaken; the Englishman came out into\r\nthe passage and cried out--\r\n\r\n“Waiter! bring me another bottle of the same port.”\r\n\r\nQuiet was restored in the hotel of N----. The night was fine and the\r\nmoon at the full. From time immemorial lovers have been pleased to gaze\r\nat our satellite. Leon and his lover opened their window, which looked\r\non a small garden, and breathed with delight the fresh air, which was\r\nfilled with the scent of a bower of clematis.\r\n\r\nThey had not looked long, however, before a man came to walk in the\r\ngarden. His head was bowed, his arms crossed, and he had a cigar in his\r\nmouth, Leon thought he recognized the nephew of the Englishman who was\r\nfond of good port wine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI dislike useless details, and besides, I do not feel called upon to\r\ntell the reader things he can readily imagine, nor to relate all that\r\nhappened hour by hour in the inn at N----. I will merely say that the\r\ncandle which burned on the fireless mantle-piece of the Blue Chamber was\r\nmore than half consumed when a strange sound issued from the\r\nEnglishman’s room, in which there had been silence until now; it was\r\nlike the fall of a heavy body. To this noise was added a kind of\r\ncracking, quite as odd, followed by a smothered cry and several\r\ninarticulate words like an oath. The two young occupants of the Blue\r\nChamber shuddered. Perhaps they had been waked up suddenly by it. The\r\nnoise seemed a sinister one to both of them, for they could not explain\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Our friend the Englishman is dreaming,” said Leon, trying to force a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nBut although he wanted to reassure his companion, he shivered\r\ninvoluntarily. Two or three minutes afterwards a door in the corridor\r\nopened cautiously, as it seemed, then closed very quietly. They heard a\r\nslow and unsteady footstep which appeared to be trying to disguise its\r\ngait.\r\n\r\n“What a cursed inn!” exclaimed Leon.\r\n\r\n“Ah, it is a paradise!” replied the young woman, letting her head fall\r\non Leon’s shoulder. “I am dead with sleep....”\r\n\r\nShe sighed, and was very soon fast asleep again.\r\n\r\nA famous moralist has said that men are never garrulous when they have\r\nall their heart’s desire. It is not surprising, therefore, that Leon\r\nmade no further attempt to renew the conversation or to discourse upon\r\nthe noises in the hotel at N----. Nevertheless, he was preoccupied, and\r\nhis imagination pieced together many events to which in another mood he\r\nwould have paid no attention. The evil countenance of the Englishman’s\r\nnephew returned to his memory. There was hatred in the look that he\r\nthrew at his uncle even while he spoke humbly to him, doubtless because\r\nhe was asking for money.\r\n\r\nWhat would be easier than for a man, still young and vigorous, and\r\ndesperate besides, to climb from the garden to the window of the next\r\nroom? Moreover, he was staying at the hotel, and would walk in the\r\ngarden after dark, perhaps ... quite possibly ... undoubtedly, he knew\r\nthat his uncle’s black bag contained a thick bundle of bank-notes....\r\nAnd that heavy blow, like the blow of a club on a bald head! ... that\r\nstifled cry! ... that fearful oath! and those steps afterwards! That\r\nnephew looked like an assassin.... But people do not assassinate in a\r\nhotel full of officers. Surely the Englishman, like a wise man, had\r\nlocked himself in, specially knowing the rogue was about.... He\r\nevidently mistrusted him, since he had not wished to accost him bag in\r\nhand.... But why allow such hideous thoughts when one is so happy?\r\n\r\nThus did Leon cogitate to himself. In the midst of his thoughts, which I\r\nwill refrain from analyzing at greater length, and which passed in his\r\nmind like so many confused dreams, he fixed his eyes mechanically on the\r\ndoor of communication between the Blue Chamber and the Englishman’s\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nIn France, doors fit badly. Between this one and the floor there was a\r\nspace of nearly an inch. Suddenly, from this space, which was hardly\r\nlighted by the reflection from the polished floor, there appeared\r\nsomething blackish and flat, like a knife blade, for the edge which the\r\ncandlelight caught showed a thin line which shone brightly. It moved\r\nslowly in the direction of a little blue-satin slipper, which had been\r\ncarelessly thrown close to this door. Was it some insect like a\r\ncentipede?... No, it was no insect. It had no definite shape.... Two or\r\nthree brown streams, each with its line of light on its edges, had come\r\nthrough into the room. Their pace quickened, for the floor was a\r\nsloaping one.... They came on rapidly and touched the little slipper.\r\nThere was no longer any doubt! It was a liquid, and that liquid, the\r\ncolor of which could now be distinctly seen by the candlelight, was\r\nblood! While Leon, paralyzed with horror, watched these frightful\r\nstreams, the young woman slept on peacefully, her regular breathing\r\nwarming her lover’s neck and shoulder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe care which Leon had taken in ordering the dinner on their arrival\r\nat the inn of N---- adequately proved that he had a pretty level head, a\r\nhigh degree of intelligence and that he could look ahead. He did not in\r\nthis emergency belie the character we have already indicated. He did not\r\nstir, and the whole strength of his mind was strained to keep this\r\nresolve in the presence of the frightful disaster which threatened him.\r\n\r\nI can imagine that most of my readers, and, above all, my lady readers,\r\nfilled with heroic sentiments, will blame the conduct of Leon on this\r\noccasion for remaining motionless. They will tell me he ought to have\r\nrushed to the Englishman’s room and arrested the murderer, or, at least,\r\nto have pulled his bell and rung up the people of the hotel. To this I\r\nreply that, in the first case, the bells in French inns are only room\r\nornaments, and their cords do not correspond to any metallic apparatus.\r\nI would add respectfully, but decidedly, that, if it is wrong to leave\r\nan Englishman to die close by one, it is not praiseworthy to sacrifice\r\nfor him a woman who is sleeping with her head on your shoulder. What\r\nwould have happened if Leon had made an uproar and roused the hotel? The\r\npolice, the inspector and his assistant would have come at once. These\r\ngentlemen are by profession so curious, that, before asking him what he\r\nhad seen or heard, they would have questioned him as follows:--\r\n\r\n“What is your name? Where are your papers? And what about Madame? What\r\nwere you doing together in the Blue Chamber? You will have to appear at\r\nthe Assizes to explain the exact month, at what hour in the night, you\r\nwere witnesses of this deed.”\r\n\r\nNow it was precisely this thought of the inspector and officers of the\r\nlaw which first occurred to Leon’s mind. Everywhere throughout life\r\nthere are questions of conscience difficult to solve. Is it better to\r\nallow an unknown traveller to have his throat cut, or to disgrace and\r\nlose the woman one loves?\r\n\r\nIt is unpleasant to have to propose such a problem. I defy the cleverest\r\nperson to solve it.\r\n\r\nLeon did then what probably most would have done in his place. He never\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\nHe remained fascinated for a long time with his eyes fixed upon the blue\r\nslipper and the little red stream which touched it. A cold sweat\r\nmoistened his temples, and his heart beat in his breast as though it\r\nwould burst.\r\n\r\nA host of thoughts and strange and horrible fancies took possession of\r\nhim, and an inward voice cried out all the time, “In an hour all will be\r\nknown, and it is your own fault!” Nevertheless, by dint of repeating to\r\nhimself “Qu’allais-je faire dens cette galere?” he finished up by\r\nperceiving some few rays of hope. “If we leave this accursed hotel,” he\r\nsaid to himself at last, “before the discovery of what has happened in\r\nthe adjoining room, perhaps they may lose trace of us. No one knows us\r\nhere. I have only been seen in blue spectacles, and she has only been\r\nseen in a veil. We are only two steps from the station, and should be\r\nfar away from it in an hour.”\r\n\r\nThen, as he had studied the time-table at great length to make out his\r\njourney, he recollected that the train for Paris stopped at eight\r\no’clock. Very soon afterward they would be lost in the vastness of that\r\ntown, where so many guilty persons are concealed. Who could discover two\r\ninnocent people there? But would they not go into the Englishman’s room\r\nbefore eight o’clock? That was the vital question.\r\n\r\nQuite convinced that there was no other course before him, he made a\r\ndesperate effort to shake off the torpor which had taken possession of\r\nhim for so long, but at the first movement he made his young companion\r\nwoke up and kissed him half-consciously. At the touch of his icy cheek\r\nshe uttered a little cry.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” she said to him anxiously. “Your forehead is as\r\ncold as marble.”\r\n\r\n“It is nothing,” he replied in a voice which belied his words. “I heard\r\na noise in the next room....”\r\n\r\nHe freed himself from her arms, then he moved the blue slipper and put\r\nan armchair in front of the door of communication, so as to hide the\r\nhorrid liquid from his lover’s eyes. It had stopped flowing, and had now\r\ncollected into quite a big pool on the floor. Then he half opened the\r\ndoor which led to the passage, and listened attentively. He even\r\nventured to go up to the Englishman’s door, which was closed. There were\r\nalready stirrings in the hotel, for day had begun. The stablemen were\r\ngrooming the horses in the yard, and an officer came downstairs from the\r\nsecond story, clinking his spurs. He was on his way to preside at that\r\ninteresting piece of work, more agreeable to horses than to men, which\r\nis technically known as _la botte_.\r\n\r\nLeon re-entered the Blue Chamber, and, with every precaution that love\r\ncould invent, with the help of much circumlocution and many euphemisms\r\nhe revealed their situation to his friend.\r\n\r\nIt was dangerous to stay and dangerous to leave too precipitately; still\r\nmuch more dangerous to wait at the hotel until the catastrophe in the\r\nnext room was discovered.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to describe the terror caused by this communication, or\r\nthe tears which followed it, the senseless suggestions which were\r\nadvanced, or how many times the two unhappy young people flung\r\nthemselves into each other’s arms, saying, “Forgive me! forgive me!”\r\nEach took the blame. They voiced to die together, for the young woman\r\ndid not doubt that the law would find them guilty of the murder of the\r\nEnglishman, and as they were not sure that they would be allowed to\r\nembrace each other again on the scaffold they did it now to suffocation,\r\nand vied with each other in watering themselves with tears. At length,\r\nafter having talked much rubbish and exchanged many tender and harrowing\r\nwords, they decided, in the midst of a thousand kisses, that the plan\r\nthought out by Leon, to leave by the eight o’clock train, was really the\r\nonly one practicable, and the best to follow. But there were still two\r\nmortal hours to get through. At each step in the corridor they trembled\r\nin every limb. Each creak of boots proclaimed the arrival of the\r\ninspector.\r\n\r\nTheir small packing was done in a flash. The young woman wanted to burn\r\nthe blue slipper in the fireplace; but Leon picked it up and, after\r\nwiping it by the bedside, he kissed it and put it in his pocket. He was\r\nastonished to find that it smelt of vanilla, though his lover’s perfume\r\nwas “Bouquet de l’Imperatrice Eugenie.”\r\n\r\nEverybody in the hotel was now awake. They heard the laughing of\r\nwaiters, servant-girls singing at their work, and soldiers brushing\r\ntheir officers’ clothes. Seven o’clock had just struck. Leon wanted to\r\nmake his friend drink a cup of coffee, but she declared that her throat\r\nwas so choked up that she should die if she tried to drink anything.\r\n\r\nLeon, armed with the blue spectacles, went down to pay the bill. The\r\nhost begged his pardon for the noise that had been made; he could not at\r\nall understand it, for the officers were always so quiet! Leon assured\r\nhim that he had heard nothing, but had slept profoundly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think your neighbor on the other side would inconvenience you,”\r\ncontinued the landlord; “he did not make much noise. I bet he is still\r\nsleeping soundly.”\r\n\r\nLeon leant hard against the desk to keep from falling, and the young\r\nwoman, who had followed him closely, clutched at his arm and tightened\r\nthe veil over her face.\r\n\r\n“He is a swell,” added the pitiless host. “He will have the best of\r\neverything. Ah! he is a good sort. But all the English are not like him.\r\nThere was one here who is a skinflint. He thought everything too dear;\r\nhis room, his dinner. He wanted me to take a five-pound Bank of England\r\nnote in settlement of his bill for one hundred and eighty-five francs,\r\n... and to risk whether it was a good one! But stop, Monsieur; perhaps\r\nyou will know, for I heard you talking English with Madam.... Is it a\r\ngood one?”\r\n\r\nWith these words he showed Leon a five-pound bank-note. On one of its\r\ncorners there was a little spot of red which Leon could readily explain\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\n“I think it is quite good,” he said in a stifled voice.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you have plenty of time,” replied the host; “the train is not due\r\nhere till eight o’clock, and it is always late. Will you not sit down,\r\nMadam? You seem tired.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment a fat servant-girl came up.\r\n\r\n“Hot water, quick,” she said, “for milord’s tea. Give me a sponge, too.\r\nHe has broken a bottle of wine and the whole room is flooded.”\r\n\r\nAt these words Leon fell into a chair, and his companion did the same An\r\nintense desire to laugh overtook them both, and they had the greatest\r\ndifficulty in restraining themselves. The young woman squeezed his hand\r\njoyfully.\r\n\r\n“I think we will not go until the two o’clock train,” said Leon to the\r\nlandlord. “Let us have a good meal at midday.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lake of The Dismal Swamp.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY JEANNETTE HOLLY.\r\n\r\nAt an early day in the history of our Nation, there had emigrated to the\r\nSoutheastern shore of the Old Dominion, an English gentleman, whose\r\nmanners and carriage bespoke aristocratic lineage, and whose free use of\r\nmoney made it evident to those in the same locality, that he must have\r\nbeen a man of parts in the country whence he had come.\r\n\r\nHe had bought up acres and acres of the land lying contiguous to the\r\nDismal Swamp, but occupied a hewn log house some miles distant from that\r\nplace of ill repute. The report gained credence that he had left the Old\r\nCountry “for the good of his health,” in other words, his knowledge of\r\nand participation in the plots and counter-plots against the government,\r\nmade it safer for both himself and some, whose fingers had ever held the\r\npulse of the Nation, that he should live elsewhere; and we find him\r\nmaking himself a home across the waters, with stint of nothing, for a\r\nvessel never made harbor, that it did not bring a large consignment to\r\nTheodore Stanton.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time he erected for himself and family a commodious\r\nhouse, many of the necessary materials coming from abroad, and he was\r\never ready to welcome to his board any wayfarer with whom he came in\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\nIt was during the time that his house was building, and he had been\r\nscouring the country for help for the work, when one day, a young Indian\r\nboy presented himself at his door asking, “Work for me do?” He spoke\r\nvery indifferent English, but Mr. Stanton understood he had come in\r\nresponse to his inquiries for hands, and he asked, “What can you do?”\r\n\r\n“Ride horse, shoot gun, hunt deer.”\r\n\r\nHis appearance appealed to Mr. Stanton, and he nodded his head saying,\r\n“You can hunt deer and bear for me, eat.”\r\n\r\nThat seemed satisfactory and from that time on, he called Mr. Stanton’s,\r\nhome, and sure enough supplied the family with all the game they could\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nBut his especial attention seemed to be paid to Mr. Stanton’s little\r\ngirl, Alice, to whom he was devoted, and who never seemed so happy or\r\ncontented, as when perched on Powhatan’s shoulders and scouring the\r\ncountry for flowers, nuts or berries. He had been at his chosen home\r\nnow, for a long time, and had learned to speak and understand our tongue\r\nvery well. He said he was descended from old Chief Powhatan and that\r\nlittle Pocahontas was his kin, but that his father had been badly\r\ntreated and set aside and would not go with his tribe of Indians; but if\r\nany questions were asked, as to where his father was, a stolid look\r\nwould settle over his countenance, and he would make no reply;\r\noccasionally he would disappear, and be gone for a day or two, but\r\nalways came back, ready for his appointed duty, to hunt the meat for Mr.\r\nStanton. He was as straight as an arrow, and it required little\r\nimagination to believe he might be descended from a line of kings, his\r\nbearing was so dignified and regal. To no one was he communicative or\r\nunbending, save little Alice, over whom he watched with jealous care.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton, Alice’s mother, had never liked him, and often expressed\r\nuneasiness at the feeling that seemed to exist between her ewe lamb, and\r\nthis dusky son of the forest, and she begged her husband to consign her\r\nto her sister’s care, in England, in that way breaking up the\r\nassociation, and giving Alice, at the same time, opportunities for\r\neducation that she would lack in the States.\r\n\r\n“No, wife, don’t ask me that; I have made sacrifices enough, God knows.\r\nI cannot stand to be parted from my little one; send for tutors,\r\ngovernesses or any other sort of SSS, that you want, I will bear all\r\nexpense, but let me see my dear daughter every day, that’s a dear.” Mrs.\r\nStanton said no more, but she watched with ever growing sorrow; the glow\r\nof pride that came to Powhatan’s dark countenance, when gazing at\r\n“Laughing Water,” as he called Alice.\r\n\r\nThe gentle girl was now turning sixteen, and had developed into great\r\nloveliness, but seemed wholly unconscious of her charms, and really I\r\nbelieve, that was the one thing that drew so many worshippers to her\r\nshrine.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a party of gentlemen had arrived from old England,\r\nlooking at lands for the settlement of some emigrants who were anxious\r\nto throw in their fate with the new settled country, and among them were\r\nthe sons of some of Mr. Stanton’s early and close friends.\r\n\r\nFrank Berkley, nephew of the ex-governor, was among the number, and\r\nsoon won his way to the hearts of old and young alike, by his kindliness\r\nand sprightliness.\r\n\r\nAlice seemed unusually lively, when he was regaling her with his\r\nexploits at college or his tilts with the fair sex at home, and her\r\nmerry laugh would ring out at his bright wit or mirthful sallies.\r\n\r\nNone seemed to observe the vengeful scowls Powhatan would throw at the\r\njolly crowd, as he crossed and recrossed the Hall, but would never enter\r\nthe parlor, nor join in any of the sports. I said none--none save the\r\nanxious mother, who ever had her eye on her darling and when as a great\r\nsecret Alice confided to her, that Frank wanted to take her across the\r\nwater with him as his bride, she assented cheerfully, for she felt that\r\nto be the only way to save her child from some direful fate.\r\n\r\nThe party was going farther West, making explorations, and would return\r\nabout Christmas time, to enjoy the festivities of that season under Mr.\r\nStanton’s hospitable roof, and would then take shipping for home.\r\nFarewells were said, and all were well on their way, but Frank lingered.\r\n“Stay with us, Frank,” Alice said tearfully, “we will be so lonely when\r\nyou are gone,” and Frank felt he would willingly tear his heart out, if\r\nit would comfort the little girl he had grown to love so much in two\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n“But,” he said, “my darling, then I would be accounted a laggard in\r\nduty, for don’t you know I was put in charge of this expedition; and\r\nwill be held strictly accountable for its failure?”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she said, “Frank, forgive me. I will not be such a baby. I know\r\nyou will soon be back, and I will try to scare away the blues and bid\r\nyou a cheerful good-bye,” and he never forgot to his dying day, how she\r\nput her arms around his neck and kissed him a fond farewell. The last\r\necho brought to him her parting words, “back soon.” They did not know\r\nthat an eye had watched their parting, and the owner of that orb, had\r\ntrembled with rage when he witnessed the caress.\r\n\r\nPowhatan tried to coax her to ride or row, and had made and painted pure\r\nwhite, a little canoe for her, but she told him it made her tired to use\r\nthe oars. “Come and see what a beauty your boat is, Minnehaha; you care\r\nno more for your poor Powhatan,” he said sadly.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, I do,” she replied, “but I worked so hard entertaining papa’s\r\nfriends, I must rest up, but I will see the boat,” and taking his hand\r\nshe ran lightly to the barn, to see and admire the little white canoe,\r\nwith places all around the top for lights to be inserted, when the\r\ncandles were lit at night; it certainly made a beautiful show. But his\r\ncoaxing could not induce her to go on the water in it, and the craft was\r\nonly rigged up to show to her friends, and still remained in Powhatan’s\r\nworkshop. The mornings were beginning to be frosty and the air to show\r\nthat the weeks had passed along and soon now, they might look for the\r\nreturn of the friends. Wild turkeys were killed and dressed, venison\r\nhams were baked and boiled, and the array of cakes and pies in the\r\npantry, looked most tempting. On the afternoon of the 23d of December,\r\nMr. Stanton was decorating the rooms, under the supervision of his good\r\nwife, and calling to Alice, said, “Daughter, we do need some holly so\r\nmuch, could you not take one of the boys, and get some from the wood on\r\nthe swamp road? I must hie me to the postoffice or would get it myself.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, Pop, I will take my pony and John and soon be back.”\r\n\r\nAs she went out Powhatan met her, and having heard what Mr. Stanton\r\nsaid, begged to be allowed to accompany her, saying, “I will take care\r\nof you, Minnehaha.” So she could not well refuse, and when he had\r\nsaddled her pony and old Thunder for himself, they mounted and rode\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThe father returned with the mail, the mother dressed for the evening\r\nmeal, but Alice came not.\r\n\r\n“Oh father,” she cried, “where can she be?” and the mother grew restless\r\nand uneasy. Presently seeing John approaching, Mr. Stanton called out,\r\n\r\n“John, where is Miss Alice, boy?”\r\n\r\n“Sir, I didn’t go with her; she went long that Injun, he say he take\r\ngood care of her.” Mrs. Stanton was almost beside herself. Wringing her\r\nhands, she begged her husband for “God’s sake,” to take some of the men\r\nand seek the child, ere she was lost in the dreadful swamps. Searching\r\nparties scoured the country all that night, and when the next morning,\r\nMr. Berkeley and his friends arrived, they, too, joined in the hunt,\r\nwhich was kept up for a whole week, but nothing was ever discovered,\r\nsave Alice’s little pony, quietly grazing on the edge of the swamp.\r\n\r\nA rumor came, that from the highest point overlooking the Lake in the\r\nDismal Swamp, a huge black horse, with two riders, was seen to jump\r\ndirectly into the lake and never rose again. From the same fisherman,\r\nwho dwelt on some high knoll in the swamp the report was scattered far\r\nand wide, that at 10 o’clock every bright night was seen a little white\r\ncanoe, lit with firefly lamps, pushed swiftly through the waters of the\r\nlake by a beautiful girl with fair locks floating over her shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe story was that she crossed the lake and then disappeared in the dark\r\nwoods beyond. But nothing was ever seen or heard of Alice or her dusky\r\nlover again. Mrs. Stanton took to her bed and died of a broken heart,\r\nleaving young Berkley to care for the stricken old man, who was soon\r\nlaid beside her in the garden that had been sweet Alice’s playground.\r\nMr. Stanton left everything he had to Frank Berkley who mourned\r\nsincerely for his lost love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEducational Department.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDUCTED BY THOS. E. WATSON.\r\n\r\nVarious Phases of the Money Question.\r\n\r\n  _Hon. Thomas E. Watson, Thomson, Ga._:\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Your logical editorial in your October magazine under the\r\ncaption of “The Money Changer and the Politician” hit the bull’s eye and\r\nwent straight to the heart of the subject. I heartily endorse the\r\neditorial. Hon. A. S. J. S----, a very able and conservative gentleman\r\nand also a gold bug as we sometimes denominate them, takes issue with\r\nyou, as to some of your assertions, and as the Doctor is a subscriber to\r\nyour magazine and very much open to conviction I am led, as a result of\r\na pleasant discussion with him to ask you some questions on said\r\neditorial for the purpose of drawing you out more fully on the subject\r\nfor the Doctor’s special benefit and for general light on the money\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe questions that I propound embody the objections of the Doctor to\r\nwhat he otherwise concedes to be an able elaboration of the question\r\nunder discussion.\r\n\r\nYou say, “Sparta rose to be a state of the first class on a currency of\r\niron; Rome became Mistress of the World on legal tender copper; coined\r\nsilver did not come into use until the Northern barbarian beat down her\r\nfrontiers; gold held no place in the coinage till the imperialism of the\r\nCaesars had taken its lead in her decline.”\r\n\r\n(1) Do you mean to say, that gold and silver did not exist as currency,\r\nprior to that period referred to in the passage just quoted?\r\n\r\nThe Doctor says you are all wrong here and asks that your authority for\r\nthe declaration be given.\r\n\r\n(2) He wants you to give more explicitly your authority for contending\r\nthat paper money is Constitutional; he combats the idea of the\r\nConstitutionality of a paper currency, asserting that gold and silver is\r\nthe money of the Constitution and not paper.\r\n\r\n(3) What is your authority for saying that Mr. Cleveland ruled that\r\nGovernmental notes which were payable _in coin_ should be redeemed in\r\n_gold only_? He disputes this.\r\n\r\n(4) In your glowing description of the effects of paper currency, during\r\nthe wars referred to by you, how it fed and clothed the soldier and kept\r\nstarvation from those the soldiers left at home--he asserts that the\r\ngold and silver currency in circulation during the times you allude to\r\ncould have accomplished all you claim; independent of a paper currency.\r\n\r\n(5) Was the paper money issued by the Confederate Government during the\r\nCivil War as good at any time, during said war, as the paper money\r\nissued by the Federal Government during the same war? If not, why not?\r\n\r\nUnderstand me, I am perfectly in accord with you. I am asking these\r\nquestions in order that you may have an opportunity to knock the\r\nsophisticated props from under the gold bug delusions and the people\r\ngiven the plain facts.\r\n\r\n  Respectfully,\r\n\r\n  W. M. HAIRSTON.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nANSWER.\r\n\r\n(1) Yes. Gold and silver were used in commerce and commodities, even as\r\nprecious metals, _but not as legal tender money_. The legal tender money\r\nof Sparta was of iron. Lycurgus made it so, for a special purpose. See\r\nPlutarch’s “Lives,” or Aristotle on “Government.”\r\n\r\nThe legal tender money of Rome was copper during all the long and bloody\r\nyears of her relentless and resistless march to world-power.\r\n\r\nGold and silver were used in commerce _on the basis of barter_--but not\r\non any other.\r\n\r\nNeither gold nor silver were coined _into legal tender money_, until\r\n_after_ Rome had become Mistress of the World.\r\n\r\nSee any standard History of Rome--Mommsen’s for instance; and see, also,\r\nDel Mar’s “Money and Civilization.”\r\n\r\n(2) Paper money _is_ Constitutional, for the reason that the\r\nConstitution, itself, gives to Congress the right to coin legal tender\r\nmoney, and the Supreme Court of the United States, in a case brought to\r\ntest that very question, decided, in effect, that the word coin, as used\r\nin the Constitution, has the sense of “create,” and that Congress can\r\ncreate legal tender money out of paper, if it sees fit to do so.\r\n\r\nCongress _had_ seen fit to do so, for the good and sufficient reason\r\nthat the expenses of the Government had increased to more than a million\r\ndollars per day, and there was no specie money in the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe Government made money out of paper because it had nothing else to\r\nmake it out of.\r\n\r\nGround hog case, Doctor.\r\n\r\n(3) The facts in the case. The Contracts were payable in coin, just as\r\nin France. The _option_, of payment in silver or in gold, belonged to\r\nthe Government _under the words and in the spirit of the contract_.\r\n\r\nIn France, it was the same. The creditors claimed payment in gold, both\r\nin this country and in France.\r\n\r\nThe French Government calmly bossed the situation _as any real\r\nGovernment should_, and paid the contracts as _it_ pleased _in either_\r\n“coin.” When the French Government felt like paying gold coin, gold was\r\npaid. When the Government felt like paying silver coin, silver was paid.\r\n\r\nIn either case, the creditor got what his contract entitled him to\r\nget--COIN.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Cleveland’s “Government” was not so robust. He took it into his\r\nhead that “the bankers had the country by the leg.” In fact, he told Mr.\r\nOates of Alabama that such was the case.\r\n\r\nAbsurd!\r\n\r\nNo _real Government_ would ever get into that kind of blue funk.\r\n\r\nMr. Cleveland should have shown some of the “back bone” that we have\r\nheard so much about. He should have said to those Wall Street Raiders,\r\n“I’ll give you COIN--get anything else if you can.”\r\n\r\nWhen the Government had the gold, the yellow metal should have been\r\nhanded out. When the Government did not have the gold, it should have\r\nhanded out silver--saying to the Raiders, “Take it, or leave it. Your\r\ncontract says COIN. There is coin. We make you _the legal tender_ of it.\r\nIf you don’t take it when so tendered, _your claim against the\r\nGovernment is as dead as Julius Caesar_.”\r\n\r\nTHEN the Government would have had _the Bankers_ “by the leg.”\r\n\r\nBut, you see, Cleveland was standing in with the Wall Street crowd--and\r\nthat makes all the difference.\r\n\r\nSuppose our friend, the Doctor referred to by Mr. Hairston, owed ten\r\ndifferent notes of ten dollars each, every one of them containing the\r\nplain statement that they are payable in “_coin_.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “THE CONUNDRUM IS: WHAT WOULD BE LEFT TO UNCLE SAM, IN\r\nTHE MATTER OF NATIONAL FINANCE, AFTER THE BANKERS SHALL HAVE GOT ALL\r\nTHAT THEY WANT?”]\r\n\r\nSuppose that they fall due and are presented for payment. Suppose the\r\nDoctor has half the money in gold coin and the balance in silver coin.\r\nSuppose he offers the entire $100 in coin, in satisfaction of the debt.\r\n\r\nSuppose the holder of the notes rejects the silver “coin,” and demands\r\nthe entire debt in gold coin.\r\n\r\nWhat would the Doctor do?\r\n\r\nWould he hurry and scurry about, hunting for gold to satisfy the\r\nexacting creditor? I’ll bet a medium sized mouse-colored mule that he\r\nwouldn’t.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor _knows_ that silver coin is legal tender, and _was\r\ncontemplated as one of the coins of payment at the time the contract was\r\nmade_.\r\n\r\nConsequently, he would tender the silver, and if the _offer to pay_ in\r\nthat “coin” were refused, the Doctor would simply let the creditor do\r\nwhat the heathen does when Christian Civilization gets after him--RAGE.\r\n\r\n(4) Let the Doctor peruse the Life of Chase, who was Secretary of the\r\nTreasury under Mr. Lincoln, and he will realize how much he is in error.\r\n\r\nMany other authorities might be cited.\r\n\r\nGold and silver had disappeared. Specie payments had ceased. The\r\nGovernment was about “broke.”\r\n\r\n_The daily expense account was approaching the two million dollar mark._\r\n\r\nSpaulding, Salmon P. Chase, Thaddeus Stevens and others realized that\r\nunless the Government could float a paper currency the jig was up.\r\n\r\nIt was just about then that _Lincoln expressed the opinion that some of\r\nthe Wall Street bankers ought to be shot_. They were manifesting every\r\ndisposition to take advantage of the distress of the Government. They\r\nwere showing that they meant to get rich off the war. And they\r\naccomplished their purpose.\r\n\r\nThey failed to obstruct the plan to issue paper money, but they\r\nsucceeded in having Congress virtually say that while the Greenback was\r\ngood enough for the soldier who was shedding his blood for his country,\r\nit was not good enough for the Bondholder who was sitting at ease in the\r\nfinancial Zion of Wall Street.\r\n\r\n(5) My understanding is that the first paper money issued by the\r\nConfederate Government circulated at par _when first issued_.\r\n\r\nThe legal tender currency of any Government must depend, in any case,\r\nupon the strength, resources and credit of the Government.\r\n\r\nEven the coin-currency _sinks to the mere commodity-value of the coin_,\r\nwhen the Government sinks.\r\n\r\nEven now there is an _artificial value in gold coin, put there by law_.\r\n\r\nNo pile of a million dollars in gold coin would sell for a million\r\ndollars _as metal_.\r\n\r\nIn such a heap of gold you must allow for “wear and tear.”\r\n\r\nThe law _does allow_ for that very thing. If the gold coin is worn away\r\nto a greater extent than ten per cent, the Government will not receive\r\nit as legal tender--nor will the metropolitan banks receive it.\r\n\r\nBut anything _less_ than ten per cent loss in weight, _the law makes\r\ngood_, by declaring that _such_ coins are _legal tender_.\r\n\r\nFew people stop to think of that.\r\n\r\nTherefore, every kind of money is fiat money; that is, THE LAW MAKES IT.\r\n\r\nNow, it must be self-evident that _the value which law puts into\r\ncurrency_ SINKS, WHEN THE LAW-MAKING POWER SINKS.\r\n\r\nIf one can conceive of such a thing as the annihilation of the United\r\nStates we must know that our gold coins would at once go into the scales\r\nto be weighed and priced _as metal_; our silver dollars would do\r\nprecisely the same thing, and each of them would be worth less than 70\r\ncents.\r\n\r\nAs for our paper money, it would be waste paper, and nothing else.\r\n\r\nUnited States greenbacks would amuse the collectors of fifty years\r\nhence, just as Confederate bills do those of the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\nFour Pertinent Questions Answered.\r\n\r\n  Enterprise, Ala.\r\n\r\n  _Hon. Thomas Watson, Thomson, Ga._:\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--1. What are the fundamental principles of the four parties,\r\nPopulist, Socialist, Democratic and Republican?\r\n\r\n2. Do you favor the way the United States allows the banks to use\r\nnational currency without interest and then charge the people 12 per\r\ncent? If not, why not?\r\n\r\n3. Do you think there is any likelihood of the Rural Free Delivery ever\r\nbeing discontinued and if so on what grounds?\r\n\r\n4. What does the Parcels Post Bill advocate?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nANSWER\r\n\r\n(1) The Populists believe in the Public Ownership of Public\r\nUtilities--such as Railroads, Telegraph and Telephone Lines, and Express\r\nCompanies.\r\n\r\nThey look upon the iron highway as a Public Road that should belong to\r\nthe Public. They believe that the tremendous power which private\r\nownership gives to the private corporations now owning the railroads is\r\ntoo great, _too ruinous when improperly used_, to be exercised by those\r\nwhose sole aim is to extract the utmost possible dollar of profit out of\r\nthe franchise.\r\n\r\nThe Populists believe, also, that there should be _a return to the\r\nmoney-system of the Constitution_.\r\n\r\nThe National Banks have USURPED the function of supplying the country\r\nwith a proper currency.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, when the Government has but $353,000,000 of its own\r\npaper notes circulating as money, the National Banks have the enormous\r\nsum of $583,000,000 of _their_ paper notes in circulation _as money_.\r\n\r\nPopulists contend that it is the prerogative and THE DUTY of the\r\ngovernment to create ALL THE MONEY THAT CIRCULATES, and to hold unto\r\nitself the power of _regulating the supply_.\r\n\r\nPopulists believe in the Tax upon Incomes, and contend that this tax\r\nshould progressively increase as the Income increases. They believe also\r\nin a tax upon Inheritance.\r\n\r\nPopulists lay particular stress upon THE GREAT PRINCIPLE OF DIRECT\r\nLEGISLATION. They believe in allowing the people to compel the\r\nlaw-making power to act when they, the people, want certain laws. They\r\ncontend that it is no more than right _to compel_ the law-makers _to\r\nrefer proposed legislation to those who are affected by it_. This\r\nprinciple has worked happily wherever given a fair trial, and is usually\r\ncalled the _Initiative and Referendum_.\r\n\r\nPopulists contend, also, that all officers should be elected by direct\r\nvote of the people, and that the people should have the right at any\r\ntime _to retire an officer who has forfeited their confidence_.\r\n\r\nThis principle is usually referred to as the _Right of Recall_.\r\n\r\nIn practice it proves a most excellent method of MAKING THE\r\nOFFICE-HOLDER “WALK THE CHALK.”\r\n\r\nPopulists also believe that we should have a system of Postal Savings\r\nBanks. These would furnish to the people _convenient_ and _safe_ places\r\nof deposit for their savings; and the system would go far to lessen the\r\ndangerous power of the metropolitan banks.\r\n\r\nPopulists are opposed to land monopoly, favor the eight-hour day in\r\nfactories and similar industries, and believe that the employment of\r\nchildren of tender age in manufacturing establishments, mines,\r\nsweatshops, etc., should be watched with hawk-like vigilance _and\r\nregulated with a parental care which puts the_ WELL-BEING OF THE CHILD\r\n_above every other consideration in the case_.\r\n\r\nPopulists believe in UNTAXED NECESSARIES OF LIFE, and contend that\r\nwhatever tariff duties are imposed should be laid upon luxuries.\r\n\r\nIn brief, Populists strive for the adoption of those principles which\r\nwould make this A REAL REPUBLIC, instead of an Aristocracy ruled by a\r\nClass, or a Plutocracy in which Dollars dominate.\r\n\r\nAnd during the whole time that the Politicians and Sages and Powers have\r\nbeen laughing at us, WE HAVE BEEN QUIETLY FURNISHING WITH OUR GARMENTS\r\nTHE WARDROBES OF SUCH EMINENT POLITICIANS, SAGES AND POWERS AS\r\nROOSEVELT, BRYAN AND HEARST.\r\n\r\nBryan accuses Roosevelt of stealing the very clothes _that Bryan himself\r\nstole from us_.\r\n\r\nAs for Hearst--before he fell down on that Murphy deal--his editorials\r\nand speeches were nothing in the world but the echo of James B. Weaver,\r\nJerry Simpson and Mary Ellen Lease!\r\n\r\nHad he kept up the lick, and not gone into that deal with Murphy, HE\r\nWOULD HAVE BEEN ELECTED GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK. He parted with his most\r\nvaluable asset when he ceased to be an Independent.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists _think_ they believe in the collective ownership of those\r\nthings necessary to the production and distribution of wealth, _but what\r\nthey are actually driving at_ IS THE CONFISCATION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY\r\nand a jolly good division of the same, in order that THE HAVE NOTS WILL\r\nBE UPON AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH THE HAVES.\r\n\r\nThat’s the inner meaning of practical Socialism, and that’s why it\r\nassumes so savage a character in our great cities.\r\n\r\nIn the hearts of the rank and file Socialists, _are burning the same\r\nfierce fires as animated_ THE GOTHS AND THE HUNS WHEN THEY BORE DOWN\r\nUPON OPULENT ROME.\r\n\r\nI have heard these people talk and I _know_ what it is _they really\r\nmean_.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Party, at present, hasn’t got any principles capable of\r\nproof.\r\n\r\nThey are waiting for the next National Convention to hand out a new suit\r\nof clothes.\r\n\r\nThey are awful sick and tired of that Parker platform, which is _almost_\r\nthe same as the Republican platform--as poor old Gassaway Davis said.\r\n\r\nBut they cannot “point with pride” to any other platform until the\r\nNational Convention meets. Just what will _then_ be done, it would take\r\nan able-bodied prophet to tell. My own opinion is that they will adopt\r\nthe leading principles of Populism and put Bryan to running for the\r\nPresidency again.\r\n\r\nThe Republican Party is doing just what Alexander Hamilton thought ought\r\nto be done--running the Government in partnership with the rich, for the\r\nbenefit of the rich.\r\n\r\nThe Republican rule is a Plutocracy, tempered by an occasional spasm of\r\nRooseveltism.\r\n\r\n(2) No. Because I do not believe in Special Privilege, nor in the\r\nconfiscation of $134,000,000 of money that belongs to the taxpayers. To\r\ntake away the people’s money on the pretext that the Government needs it\r\nto pay expenses, and then _to deliver it over to a few Pet Banks to be\r\nused without interest_, IS CONFISCATION. And it’s a burning NATIONAL\r\nINJUSTICE AND SHAME!\r\n\r\n(3) No. Because Congress dare not do it. The people would not stand it.\r\n\r\n(4) The transportation by the Government, through the mails, of small\r\npackages--say one, two, three, four, five, ten, fifteen pounds--at a\r\nmoderate cost, thus protecting the people from the robber Express\r\nCompanies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook Reviews.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDUCTED BY THOS. E. WATSON.\r\n\r\n  ANN BOYD. By Will N. Harben. Harper & Bros., New York City,\r\n  Publishers. Price $1.50.\r\n\r\nAmong the lads whose parents belonged to that great, wholesome class\r\nwhich Lincoln used to call “the plain people,” you would have found the\r\ncreator of Abner Daniel, Pole Baker, and Ann Boyd had you gone to the\r\nlittle North Georgia town of Dalton, soon after the Civil War.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILL N. HARBEN.]\r\n\r\nTwo years old at the time that the deliberate treachery of William H.\r\nSeward provoked the rash Confederates into firing upon Fort Sumter,--the\r\ncostly folly against which Bob Toombs protested in vain,--Mr. Harben\r\nheard and saw much of the actual marching and countermarching of the\r\nensuing four years of THE MOST UTTERLY INSANE WAR RECORDED IN HISTORY.\r\n\r\nHaving been given a private education, the young man embarked in\r\nbusiness enterprises, and it was not until after 1886 that a mediocre\r\nbusiness man was offered up, a willing sacrifice, to a first-class\r\nliterary artist. Harben, the business man, means nothing to anybody, but\r\nHarben, the literary genius, means a vast deal to everybody--for he is,\r\ntoday, the most distinctly _original and creative literary genius in\r\nAmerica_.\r\n\r\n_David Harum_ took the world by storm because of its unique portrayal of\r\na typical American business-man--shrewd, strong, persistent, humorous,\r\nrough in most places and soft in spots. Banker and horse-trader, David\r\nHarum knew human nature like a book, and was chock full of that rare\r\narticle called common sense.\r\n\r\nAbner Daniel was in all respects the equal of David Harum, without being\r\nan imitation; Pole Baker was superior, in some respects, to Abner\r\nDaniel, and Ann Boyd enters a different class altogether.\r\n\r\nThe creations of Dickens and Thackeray offer nothing better, nothing\r\nmore human, nothing more symmetrically natural and fascinating, than\r\nthis heroic woman--tender-hearted, pure, brave and true--whose husband\r\nforsakes her, whose child is taken away from her, whose enemies\r\npersecute her, whose friends drop away from her, but who, standing at\r\nbay and battling with the whole array, CONQUERS.\r\n\r\nIt is pathetic and it is grand.\r\n\r\nHow the proud woman covers her wounds and complains not; how the strong\r\nsoul finds itself _sustained from within_; how she brings a stupidly\r\nnarrow, prejudiced and malicious neighborhood to confusion and utter\r\ndefeat, is a story that makes one thrill with sympathy and admiration.\r\n\r\nThis number of the JEFFERSONIAN MAGAZINE begins the serial publication\r\nof Mr. Harben’s greatest book.\r\n\r\nREAD IT CAREFULLY.\r\n\r\nFew better books have been written.\r\n\r\n\r\nBooks Received.\r\n\r\n  BUFF.

Our cotton\r\nbuyers have hundreds of bales of cotton stored here in every conceivable\r\nplace because they can’t get cars to ship it away.\r\n\r\nOur merchants have goods on the road which were shipped to them days,\r\nweeks and almost months ago, and are losing sales daily because they\r\ncan’t get the goods delivered on time.\r\n\r\nSometimes there is no freight train to arrive here for two days at a\r\ntime. Whose fault this is _The Record_ doesn’t know, but it must be the\r\n“Big Guns” who own the road.\r\n\r\nNot a freight train has arrived here on time in two months. Thousands of\r\ndollars have been lost to the merchants and farmers of this section\r\nthrough the criminal neglect of those who are at the head of this greedy\r\noctopus, better known as the Southern Railway, which has Georgia in its\r\npower as strongly as ever a boa constrictor of South Africa encircled\r\nits victim.\r\n\r\nHow long? Oh Lord! How long, will this thing last?\r\n\r\nHasn’t Georgia’s Railroad Commission some power to do something for the\r\npeople of Georgia in this matter? If they haven’t they might as well\r\nclose up shop and go home and try and find some calling more suitable to\r\ntheir respective talents, provided the members of that representative\r\n(?) body have any.\r\n\r\nThe depot agent at this place is as painstaking and gentlemanly as any\r\nrailroad official in Georgia, but is helpless. He is worked to death for\r\nwant of sufficient help. He is doing the work of two men.\r\n\r\nFrom the section boss to the highest official on the line in\r\nquestion--the Elberton Air Line--that’s the road we’re talking\r\nabout--the pay is less by one third than it should be and not half\r\nenough help is employed in any of the departments.\r\n\r\nIf the crew on the freight train that runs on this road were animals, we\r\ncould indict the authorities for cruelty to animals, but as they are\r\nonly human beings there is no law to cover the case. More’s the pity.\r\nThere’s something wrong with the law when it allows a greedy corporation\r\nto work its men to death.\r\n\r\nWhy not put on two freight trains per day, having them to leave Elberton\r\nand Toccoa early in the morning and returning in the afternoon? _The\r\nRecord_ believes this would solve the problem and stop the congestion of\r\nfreight on this line, at least.\r\n\r\nThe people of this section are broad minded and generous, and only want\r\nwhat is due them from any standpoint, but propose to get what is coming\r\nto them if it is gettable.\r\n\r\nAs we said in the beginning, we tried to keep still about this matter,\r\nbut our hammer has begun to knock and we propose to keep it up until\r\nsomething is done.\r\n\r\n_The Record_ will begin, next week, to circulate a petition among our\r\nbusiness men regarding this matter and proposes to send said petition to\r\nVice-President Andrews, of the Southern, in Charlotte, N. C., to Mr.\r\nMcMannus, in Greenville, S. C., and to the great and only Georgia\r\nRailroad Commission, in the city of Atlanta.\r\n\r\nWill our sister cities along the Southern, from Toccoa to Elberton, do\r\nthe same thing?\r\n\r\n_The Record_ will wait and see.--_Royston (Ga.) Record._\r\n\r\n\r\nPaid Dear for Their Titles.\r\n\r\nThe girls of these United States have always borne the name of being the\r\nmost vivacious, intelligent and common sense mortals of any other\r\nnation, but as is the case in all other things, there are exceptions to\r\nthe rule, and when they do depart from the record they can make the very\r\nworse breaks of any. Just think of as intelligent, cultivated girls as\r\nAnna Gould and Consuelo Vanderbilt allowing such broken down old foreign\r\nsports, gamblers and roues as Count Boni de Castellane and the Duke of\r\nMarlborough, persuading them that they were loved, not for their riches\r\nbut themselves, and marrying such cattle when they could have secured\r\ngood, honest, sober, loving husbands at home. One is now suing for\r\ndivorce in Paris after her Frenchman has spent eight millions of her\r\nmoney, and the other is applying for a separation in London. If it was\r\nforeign titles these girls were seeking, they have paid dear for their\r\nlittle toy and really deserve no sympathy, but if they sought the men\r\nmerely for their supposed merits, the two women ought to have guardians\r\nappointed over them for the remainder of their lives, for they have no\r\nidea of how to take care of themselves.--_Gainesville (Fla.) Elevator._\r\n\r\n\r\nHonesty and Honor.\r\n\r\nPope says that an honest man is the noblest work of God and Paul says to\r\nprovide things honest in the sight of all men.\r\n\r\nWebster says that honor is esteem due or paid to worth. Bacon says that\r\nsome in their actions do woo, and affect honor and reputation.\r\n\r\nIn common parlance we call a man honest, if he pays his just and true\r\ndebts. Is that true? If a person pays debts with money secured by\r\nextorting the widows and orphans, by pressing the poor, by selling hell\r\nand damnation to youths, is he to be called honest? Certainly not. He is\r\nneither honest nor honorable.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of folk, who think themselves honest and would\r\nresent with their strong arms even an insinuation of dishonesty on their\r\npart, that fall as far short of being honest and honorable men as\r\nthieves do of being angels. They are an ingenious sort of people, whose\r\nheads are full of tricks and schemes, and their greatest joy consists of\r\nworking them upon the public. They had rather make money dishonestly\r\nthan honestly. To enlist them in any cause only the whisper of the word\r\nscheme is necessary. Yet, they pay their debts and they seem to think\r\nthat this alone will carry them to “heaven on flowery beds of ease.”\r\n\r\n_The honest and honorable men in a community are those, with characters\r\nso well known, as to never be approached secretly or otherwise, in\r\nbehalf of screening any evil, upholding any wrong, fostering any unholy\r\nscheme. They stand boldly for right living and everybody knows it._\r\n\r\nThe clever, popular men of a community are not always the honorable and\r\nthe honest. Their popularity often results from their closed lips and\r\nsilent hands. They are polite, generous and liberal, but are\r\napproachable and ready participants in any sort of secret deal for a\r\nlittle cash. Money in their eyes looks brighter than honesty and they\r\nare neither honest nor honorable, although very clever fellows.\r\n\r\nBut there is in every community persons, possessed of righteous\r\nconsciences, with so high ideals of the right and so much hatred for the\r\nwrong, as to be unable to restrain themselves in taking brave, bold\r\nstands in every civic and religious reform.\r\n\r\n_Boys, the object of this article is to elevate manhood in Gwinnett\r\ncounty and the latter are the characters for your patterns.

Journal._\r\n\r\n\r\nSacred Prosperity.\r\n\r\nDivine right is still to be discovered in high finance, although not so\r\nusual as a few years ago it was. A group of minority stockholders,\r\nclamoring for an accounting from Mr. HARRIMAN, were consoled by his\r\nlawyer with the assurance that “Mr. Harriman moves in a higher world,\r\nwhere stockholders may not hope to enter.” The president of the Union\r\nPacific Railroad may continue to keep stockholders beyond the\r\nbattlements of his personal paradise; but the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, by virtue of the Railroad Rate bill, have the right to make\r\ninquisitorial entry. The rate bill became a law on August 28. The\r\nraising of the Union Pacific dividend from six to ten per cent. was\r\neffected by Mr. Harriman on August 16. If the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission have been under embarrassment about picking a railroad which\r\nshall be compelled to lower its freight rates, the juxtaposition of\r\ndates should make them easy. A road which at once pays exorbitant\r\ndividends and charges exorbitant rates seems to need their services. It\r\nis not for the purpose of paying higher wages to his conductors and\r\nengineers that Mr. Harriman charges high rates. His operating expenses\r\nare but 52.51 per cent. of his gross receipts; whereas the average of\r\nall our railroads is 67.79 per cent. When a shipper pays Mr. Harriman\r\none dollar, fifty-three cents goes to pay the trainmen and for the\r\nother purposes embraced under operating expenses; about two cents\r\ngoes for taxes, and forty-five cents goes to paying the interest on\r\nbonds and to meeting the necessities of Mr. Harriman’s ten per cent.\r\nrequirements.--_Collier’s Weekly._\r\n\r\n\r\nTrial for Murder.\r\n\r\nOur system of criminal jurisprudence is better than most, and as good as\r\nany with the possible exception of the English. But no one denies that\r\nit has monstrous faults. In New York recently one man shot another over\r\na woman. Both men were rich and the woman beautiful--a combination that\r\nwill instantly wreck the essential purpose of criminal law anywhere in\r\nthe United States. Already the newspapers abundantly foreshadow what\r\nwill happen. The material facts in the case--so far as concerns the\r\npurpose of the law to protect human life--were brought out by the\r\ncoroner in about half an hour. Hereafter we shall hear very little of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nPress reports assure us that a fine array of legal talent on either\r\nside is preparing to play a splendid game of chess. If it can be shown\r\nthat one of the men led a life more vicious than the other that will\r\nscore ten for the side that shows it. The sorry muck-heap of the woman’s\r\ncareer will be raked fore and aft until it has yielded every point that\r\nwill count on one side or the other. The lawyers will construct a great\r\nmelodrama, with the villain, heroine and hero, to be presented to the\r\njury. The verdict--the very life of the accused--will depend upon the\r\nskill with which the game is played and the success with which the\r\nmelodrama is “put on.”\r\n\r\n“Thou shalt not kill,” says the commandment. One can imagine a\r\ncompletely civilized state, in noble dignity, requiring the one man to\r\nanswer whether he did kill and murder the other, contrary to its\r\nstatute. It is merely an imagining, however. Our famous murder trials,\r\nwith their tawdry tricks in the face of death and their rotten plays to\r\nsentiment, are pretty exclusively barbarous.--_Saturday Evening Post._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Negroes.\r\n\r\nSenator Bailey talks, as there is no law against his utterances. “The\r\nfree negro,” he declares, in his amiable attempt to induce in his\r\nhearers a calm and rational mode of thought, “is a more serious menace\r\nto the South than the negro in slavery.” In Alabama, a couple of weeks\r\nago, at a Republican convention, there was not a negro present--one of\r\nthe details indicating a general drift of the Republicans toward leaving\r\nthe negroes out of their politics. Meantime, the negroes themselves are\r\ndivided sharply in their meeting of the situation. The so-called\r\n“Niagara Movement” puts out an address to the country which observes:\r\n“We claim for ourselves every single right that belongs to a free-born\r\nAmerican, political, civil, and social.” The whole address is a mass of\r\nalmost bombastic rhetoric on this theme. Meantime, another leader\r\nspeaks: “Let constructive progress be the dominant note among us in\r\nevery section of America. An inch of progress is worth more than a yard\r\nof fault-finding. The races that have grown strong and useful have not\r\ndone so by depending upon finding fault with others, but by presenting\r\nto the world evidences of progress in agriculture, industrial and\r\nbusiness life, as well as through religious, educational, and civic\r\ngrowth.” Without failing to make it clear that he wishes the equal\r\nprotection of the law, Mr. Washington refuses to complain, to whine\r\nabout social rights and aspirations, and prefers to tell his fellows the\r\nmost useful things to do. He leaves white faults to white men and warns\r\nnegroes against negro weaknesses. Which leader will the negroes follow,\r\nand which speaks with wisdom and with strength?--_Collier’s Weekly._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Labor Famine.\r\n\r\nWhat has become of all our laborers is a question which no one seems\r\nable to answer just at present, but that they are not to be had is too\r\nwell known. In the cotton belt of Texas, churches and Sunday schools are\r\norganizing parties and going into the fields to save the crop; in other\r\nof the cotton growing states the women are helping the men gather the\r\nstaple; immigrants are offered work almost before they have put a foot\r\non American soil; out West two great rival railroads are scouring the\r\nwoods for men; factories where child labor has been legislated out are\r\nrunning short-handed, and it would appear that if our prosperity did not\r\nabate a bit from other causes it would do so from lack of labor with\r\nwhich to carry it on. Meanwhile communities are learning the gentle art\r\nof smiling, trade is booming and not even an approaching election can\r\noffer an opening to the pessimist.--_Pensacola News._\r\n\r\n\r\nCotton and the Negro.\r\n\r\nOur Statesmen tell us in one breath that the salvation of the South is\r\nin the planting of less cotton and getting more for it and, in the very\r\nnext breath, they say that immigration will save us. They invite the\r\nyankee to come, and the German, and the Irish, and the Scandinavian and\r\neven the Italian.\r\n\r\nIf it be true that we are planting enough cotton, even too much, and it\r\nis true, wherein will the South be benefited by having thousands of the\r\nforeigners settle here to raise more cotton? There is but one answer. We\r\ndon’t need any more cotton planters.\r\n\r\nBut it is contended that foreign immigration will settle the race\r\nquestion. Maybe it will. Maybe it won’t. The cotton patch negro hasn’t\r\ngiven us any trouble, nor will he, and he isn’t going to leave either.\r\nHe is satisfied, his landlord is satisfied, and a German or a\r\nScandinavian upon the scene will mean two cotton patches instead of one,\r\none for him and one for the negro.\r\n\r\nTrue, there are many of our ambitious farmers who can’t secure enough\r\nlaborers to make enough cotton to get rich as fast as they would, but\r\nthey’ll get rich quick enough in using our present available labor,\r\nthereby raising less cotton, getting more for it, and, at the same time,\r\neither resting their lands or sowing it in small grain. And when these\r\nwealthy farmers plant less cotton, they benefit every poor fellow,\r\nstanding between the plow handles, in the entire South.\r\n\r\nAnd this one or two horse farmer is the ideal citizen, anyway. The best\r\ncommunities are those made up of small farmers. The churches, schools\r\nand social conditions in a community, in which one man owns all the land\r\nand runs forty plows, are not as good as one with forty land owners.\r\nOglethorpe county would, no doubt, be a better county today, if Jim\r\nSmith had never been born, and this is not said with the spirit of\r\ncriticising a single act of his life, either.\r\n\r\nIt’s all right for immigrants to build our cities, our railroads, our\r\nmanufacturing enterprises or to labor in the cities, on the railroads,\r\nin the factories or even take servants’ places, but the South doesn’t\r\nneed any more cotton raisers.--_Gwinnett (Ga.) Journal._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Railroad Power.\r\n\r\nThe railroad magnates have divided up the lines in this country among\r\nnine families of plutocrats, who by controlling transportation of\r\npassengers and freight, can control the Government. They are divided as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Harriman            22,276\r\n  Vanderbilt          20,493\r\n  Pennsylvania        20,138\r\n  Hill                19,407\r\n  Morgan              18,789\r\n  Gould               13,789\r\n  Moore               13,028\r\n  Rockefeller         10,293\r\n  Santa Fe             7,809\r\n                     -------\r\n      Total          146,112\r\n\r\nThat is three-fourths of the mileage of the country and the control of\r\nthe main lines in every state and territory. It puts into the hands of\r\nthese men a greater power than was ever exercised by any group of kings,\r\nlords and dukes who ever formed a community of interests. In all past\r\nhistory, to overthrow such a power as that, a resort to long and bloody\r\nwars was the only recourse. It remains to be seen whether the great\r\npeace movements of the last few years, for which Andrew Carnegie has\r\nbuilt a temple at The Hague, will produce a sentiment strong enough to\r\nsettle this question peaceably. Would Andrew Carnegie encourage\r\nanarchistic disorders if he thought there was a danger of a reduction\r\nof the tariff on steel? Railroad combination and robber tariffs are only\r\nanother manifestation of what we once called the “money power.”--_Omaha\r\n(Neb.,) Investigator._\r\n\r\n\r\nPopulism Forever.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the future of the People’s party, whether it is doomed\r\nto pass away and give place to some other party that will present its\r\nprinciples, or whether it may yet rise as it deserves to do and get\r\ncontrol of the Government, remains yet to be seen.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain. It has already accomplished more in this\r\nGovernment in the last fifteen years in the way of creating public\r\nsentiment and political conviction than both of the old parties.\r\n\r\nFifteen years ago the two old parties were discussing nothing but\r\nTariff. The Money question, the Railroad question and the Trust question\r\nwere entirely ignored by them. Not because the leaders of the two old\r\nparties did not know the magnitude and importance of these questions;\r\nbut they got their campaign boodle from these rich corporations and they\r\nwere willing to accept the money and let the common people perish.\r\n\r\nWhen the Populists came on the scene they began to “cry aloud and spare\r\nnot.”\r\n\r\nThey showed that the same laws of supply and demand that regulated the\r\nprices of other commodities, also regulated the price of money, that\r\nwhen money was plentiful, prices were high, all kinds of business\r\nprosperous and labor fully employed and well paid. While on the other\r\nhand when money was scarce it was high; all industries paralized, men\r\nout of work and their families suffering for bread.\r\n\r\nThey showed that the great railroad corporations had secured the public\r\nfranchises and were taxing the people without their consent and without\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\nThey showed that their great corporations, growing enormously rich were\r\ncombining together and forming “Trusts” and that they will eventually\r\ncontrol all prices, and as completely own and control the country as did\r\nthe Barons under the Feudal system.\r\n\r\nTheir cry and their plea was invincible.\r\n\r\nTheir arguments could not be answered.\r\n\r\nRidicule and abuse might serve to keep them down for awhile, but the\r\njust indictment against the two old parties was destined some day to be\r\nsustained.\r\n\r\nToday the Populist looks on with pleasure and sees his principles\r\ngrowing in public favor every day.\r\n\r\nThe Republican president and the Democratic leader are endorsing the\r\nvery doctrines that were fifteen years ago considered the most radical.\r\n\r\nAll honor to the Populists.--_Nevada County (Ark.) Picayune._\r\n\r\n\r\nSense.\r\n\r\nCan there be such a thing as a radical conservative? John Temple Graves\r\nthinks Col. Pleasant Stovall, of the _Savannah Press_, fits that kind of\r\na job. We believe that a trimmer--if that is what Col. Graves means to\r\ncall Col. Stovall--is the most decent citizen that afflicts human\r\nsociety. He stops rushing things when a sense of the proprieties tells\r\nhim that a thing has been rushed far enough to make it coarse or common\r\n(use which word you prefer), and the result is that his hair does not\r\ngrow too long, nor his ears too puritanically short.\r\n\r\nYes, sir, the medium grade takes the cake. Except in an occasional\r\nstorm, the radicals may overrun all opposition; but it don’t last, and\r\nthe fellow that wins on an extravagant moral issue may be found in the\r\nditch dead drunk as soon as public sentiment gets normal and resorts\r\nfor a season to common sense arrangements of its ethics and politics.\r\n\r\nYes, the men who make an over-display of honesty for the season always\r\nget left as soon as the folks get back to their normal qualities. Common\r\nsense controls when the excitement has passed.--_Cordele Rambler._\r\n\r\n\r\nA Lesson in Fusion.\r\n\r\nHearst got beat for Governor of New York while the balance of the State\r\nticket he was on got elected. A few of the successful candidates are\r\nIndependence League men, but most of them are straight Democrats. Thus\r\nHearst’s reform work was turned to the benefit of corrupt and foul\r\nTammany. We hope this lesson in fusion will be enough for the League.\r\nHearst was defeated by about 60,000, while the other State candidates on\r\nthe League-Democratic fusion ticket were elected by small pluralities.\r\nTammany scratched Hearst. The Wall Street element of the Democratic\r\nparty either scratched him or voted the Republican ticket. We are\r\ninclined to think well of Hearst because of those who scratched him.\r\nHearst says the fight for the rights of the people is still on. With his\r\ngreat daily papers he can do a vast work toward overthrowing the rule of\r\nthe money power, if he gets into the middle of the road and stays there.\r\nBut if he endeavors to work within the old party he will do more to\r\nprevent the success of the people than forty Clevelands could do. Maybe\r\nthe thing wasn’t hardly ripe and he had to back out, which he did by\r\nfusing with the Democrats after the League had nominated a straight\r\nticket. We are guessing that Hearst will be in the middle of the road\r\nsupporting Tom Watson for President in 1908.--_Missouri World._\r\n\r\n\r\nA Significant Vote.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said of W. R. Hearst’s individual sincerity and\r\nintegrity of purpose, the vote which almost landed him in the governor’s\r\nchair of New York State--a position which is next to the presidency--is\r\nthe vote which is dissatisfied with corporation conditions. It is a\r\nsignificant vote. And the strong anti-Hearst sentiment among the “upper\r\nten” all over the South is also significant. Everywhere men are,\r\nconsciously or unconsciously, taking their positions along lines of\r\neconomics.--_Farmers’ Journal, Abilene, Texas._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere He Belongs.\r\n\r\nTom Watson is back in Georgia, where he belongs. He is too warm, too\r\nimpulsive, too frank and too honest for New York--cold, calculating,\r\ndeceitful, hateful New York.--_Farmers’ Journal, Abilene, Tex._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters From the People.\r\n\r\n\r\nHalf Jackal and Half Hyena.\r\n\r\n  _Lucian L. Knight, Los Angeles, Cal._\r\n\r\nI cannot silence without gratifying the impulse which prompts me to\r\nwrite you at once after reading what you have to say about that\r\nsuperlative scoundrel, Mann. As a friend who holds you in loyal and\r\naffectionate admiration, I resent with all my heart the treatment which\r\nyou have received at the hands of one who is man in name only and who in\r\nnature is half jackal and half hyena. I am aware how true it is that the\r\nmost insignificant of insects may vex even the noble lion. Mann may be a\r\nmillionaire, but I warrant his shillings are dirty. How miserably poor\r\nthe wretch is when the only assets he has in the world are the millions\r\nwhich lie in the bank!\r\n\r\nI know how little things have annoyed me at times and I know how much I\r\nhave appreciated an impulsive word of sympathy, even from “the least of\r\nthese.”\r\n\r\nI am sorry I could not get the extracts you were to send me in time for\r\nVol. I of the Reminiscences which will be ready for publication within\r\nthe next few weeks; but I hope to get them in time for Vol. II. The work\r\nwill require two volumes. I have met with so much encouragement that I\r\nam warranted in beginning at once upon Vol. II. Disappointed in other\r\ncherished plans and prospects, I am now putting my life’s ambition into\r\nthis work which I trust to be able to make of literary and historic\r\nvalue to Georgia.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Anonymous Slander Rebuked.\r\n\r\n  _W. H. Eddy, Los Angeles, Cal._\r\n\r\nCan you explain what quality there is in human nature, that prompts some\r\nspecimens of the race to the doing of things which are admirably adapted\r\nto the hindrance of all that they profess to be in earnest support of?\r\nNow, for instance: in _The Appeal to Reason_ of October 27th, is an\r\nunsigned article headed, “Populism and the Pap.” Being unsigned would\r\nindicate that it came from the pen of J. A. Wayland, or that of F. D.\r\nWarren, the present Managing Editor. Now, both of these men have been\r\nearnest workers for several years, or at least for what they conceive to\r\nbe the cause of socialism. It would seem as though, when two men are\r\nassociated in a work which each of them has advocated and written signed\r\narticles in favor of, lauding it as a movement opposed to dishonesty,\r\ndeceit and all the baser tendencies of the depraved mind, that when he\r\ntakes a notion to stultify himself, descend to the lowest practices of\r\nthe gutter blackguard, he would have consideration enough for his\r\nassociate to sign his name, so that decent people who may be so\r\nunfortunate as to peruse it, and such of the patrons of the paper as\r\nhave both decency and brains enough to resent it, might not blame the\r\ninnocent party inadvertently.\r\n\r\nIf socialism is anything, or is to be anything in human history which is\r\nto make for the betterment of humanity, then it must rest upon the\r\nfundamental principles of honesty, justice and truth. All those who\r\nwould not be cursed by its adoption to-morrow, by reason of their lack\r\nof development and their consequent lack of capacity to appreciate its\r\nmeaning and the obligations inherent in it, assert that brotherly love,\r\nthe golden rule, and the Sermon on the Mount, are also corner-stones in\r\nthe foundation of its most noble structure.\r\n\r\nBut let us leave the latter out of consideration for the present. It is\r\nnot conceivable that there can be dug up in the office of the _Appeal_\r\none individual so low in the scale of human development as not to\r\nconcede honor, truth and justice as being the beginning, the very A B C\r\nof socialism. What must we think, then, of the estimate that the one who\r\npenned the abominable article referred to, places upon the intelligence\r\nof his readers, to say nothing of the hundreds who have drawn from the\r\nlittle stock of their earnings which are really needed for the comfort\r\nof themselves and family, to assist this poor degenerate in distributing\r\nhis venom and flaunting his idiocy in the faces of a nation of\r\nintelligent people, to the disheartenment of thousands of advocates of\r\nsocialism, and the great glee of those who aver that the animus of\r\nsocialism and of all socialists is such as “Breathes the hot breath of\r\nbrutal hate, and riots as it runs” through the two columns of the\r\n“Appeal?” To those who have not been unfortunate enough to read it,\r\nsuffice it to say that it is a wholly uncalled for, unsocialistic, and,\r\nfrom every point of view, rascally, assault upon Hon. Thomas E. Watson,\r\nand to make it, if possible, more pusillanimous, it is given publicity\r\njust at a time when, on account of Mr. Watson’s having been grievously\r\nmisused by his former business associates in the _Watson’s Magazine_\r\nenterprise, Mr. Watson is deserving of the sympathy of every person who\r\npossesses a spark of decency. It is cowardly in the extreme to strike a\r\nperson when he is down or crippled.\r\n\r\nMr. Watson’s life history is now an open book to anyone, not an absolute\r\nignoramus, in this broad country. He has his prejudices. He has his own\r\npolitical ideas, which, at the test of the ballot box, have been shown\r\nto be largely in the minority, but, to his honor be it said, the fact\r\nthat they were not the winning card, has never caused him for one moment\r\nto falter in devoting time, money and energy in their advocacy, a fact\r\nwhich of itself would give the lie to the baseless, senseless and\r\nhypocritical charge of treachery and double dealing, which, by their own\r\nstatements, finds 250,000 duplications in this issue of the Appeal.\r\n\r\nIt is doing too much honor to quote from it, but the readers of progress\r\nwill excuse the presentation of some short samples. “Tom appears to have\r\na grudge against whatever tends toward progress.” Think of that in\r\nreference to the father of the rural free delivery postal system which\r\ncarries tens of thousands of copies of this very diatribe of lies to the\r\nfarmers of the country, in whose interest Watson succeeded in having\r\nthis system established, as the _Congressional Record_ will bear\r\nwitness. Again, “But he has been repudiated by the respectable\r\ndemocratic press of his state--as witness the merciless exposure of his\r\nmethods by the _Atlanta Constitution_ and the _Macon Telegraph_!”\r\nRespectable! The _Atlanta Constitution_ and the _Macon Telegraph_!\r\nSocialists of intelligence, what have you to say of the creature so lost\r\nto decency as to, in the columns of the leading socialist weekly paper\r\nof America, if not of the world, so far as circulation goes, laud the\r\n_Atlanta Constitution_ and the _Macon Telegraph_, notoriously the most\r\nmercenary and most thoroughly corporation-serving papers of the entire\r\nSouth, and for no other reason--for he can plead no other--than because\r\nthey are fighting Tom Watson, who happens to be under the ban of his\r\ndispleasure?\r\n\r\nAnd why are the ultra corporation journals fighting Tom Watson? Because\r\nhonest Tom Watson is sacrificing his private interests in a determined\r\neffort to defeat the machinations of the Walter Parkers, the Herrins and\r\nthe Abe Ruefs of his beloved state.\r\n\r\nAgain: “That Watson received the price for his perfidy is not for a\r\nmoment to be doubted.” Whoever penned those lines either knew that he\r\nwas penning a most villainous lie or he is too ignorant to be worthy of\r\nthe contempt of a chimpanzee. There isn’t a person with intelligence\r\nenough to write connectedly on truth, or any part of the scurrilous rot\r\nthis creature did, but knows perfectly well that if Tom Watson had been\r\ncorruptible, he could have received ten times more to have sold himself\r\nto the very forces this creature is supposed to be fighting, than it has\r\never been claimed he did get. That is just as true of Tom Watson as it\r\nis of ’Gene V. Debs. Everyone, including the writer of that malicious\r\nscreed, _knows_ that they both could be rolling luxuriously in wealth if\r\nthey had but followed the course of these very papers which he is\r\npleased to declare “respectable.”\r\n\r\nBut the last quotation is manly as compared with this one: “It is said\r\nthat he has been up for sale before, and was knocked down to the highest\r\nbidder,” etc., “It is said!” The language of the conscienceless gossip,\r\nthe method of the footpad, with the sand-bag, or the gas-pipe who\r\nstrikes you out of the dark. Again: “John M. Barnes, a man for whose\r\nveracity many stand ready to vouch, etc.” Very good, Mr. No-name. Mr.\r\nBarnes is good enough authority to use in an effort to injure your\r\nbrother man, Mr. Thos. Watson. Would you accept Mr. John M. Barnes’\r\nstatement as to the offices you, your associates and the _Appeal to\r\nReason_ are performing in America, and would you abide by and endorse\r\nthem in your own case? Never! And that very fact impeaches your honesty\r\nin quoting, as against Tom Watson, the slanders of corporation hirelings\r\nand political hacks, whom you know are fighting him for what there is in\r\nit. No! no! When you go straining a point, you always _prove too much_.\r\n\r\nBe something like a man, and bid him God speed in his task of awakening\r\nthe people to their dangers, even if he does leave them short of being\r\nfull-fledged socialists.\r\n\r\nTom Watson’s opinions are not in all respects mine. In fact, there are\r\nmany points on which we do not agree. But if I have outgrown the tenets\r\nof Populism, and he has not, or if he sees so many falling away from the\r\nmere party organization of populism as to be heart-sore and discouraged,\r\nand chooses to advocate _the same principles_ under the name of\r\nJeffersonian Democracy, he is still entitled to the respect of friend\r\nand foe alike, until he sacrifices principle to greed or puerile hatred.\r\n\r\n\r\nWants to Follow Watson’s Pen.\r\n\r\n  _L. A. Benson, Clay Center, Kan._\r\n\r\nI write to inquire as to the truth or falsity of the rumor that you have\r\nsevered your connection with the Magazine which bears your name. I have\r\nbeen a voting Prohibitionist since 1885. I bought the first issue of\r\n“_Tom Watson’s_” and read it, and have hungered for its appearance ever\r\nsince. I have read every line of Editorial and other matter which came\r\nfrom your pen. I was beginning to think myself so much of a Populist\r\nthat I could “keep step.” From 1894 until 1901 I lived in Philadelphia,\r\nPa., and judging the Populists from the caricatures appearing in Eastern\r\npapers I felt surprised to find that I have all along possessed just\r\nsuch views as constitute the essence of Populism. I find myself\r\nunwilling to give up the opportunity to follow your pen. I will regard\r\nit as a matter of genuine kindness to me if you will put me in\r\nconnection with the Magazine which takes your copy and spreads it among\r\nyour many disciples and admirers. I regard the work which you are doing\r\nas _fundamental_, and I am aware that you, like all leaders in reforms\r\nwhich touch the money-king, will suffer. If it be in the power of “Old\r\nPlute” to crucify you, he will not be too tender. He will not be lacking\r\nin heartless cruelty. But while you are bidding high for the hate and\r\nvengeance of “Old Plute” you are winning the glorious title of “friend”\r\nand “brother” to those who are crushed ’neath the heel of this\r\nheartless, greedy foe. To _oppose_ him and to _stand the loving helper_\r\nof men, is to trace the footsteps of the Man of Galilee, up a modern\r\nCalvary. In plain language, it is the essence of pure and undefiled\r\nreligion. Here’s my hand, brother, and may God bless and prosper you.\r\n\r\n\r\nHedging on Human Life.\r\n\r\n  _N. B. McDowell, Ronceverte, W. Va._\r\n\r\nIn reply to your question in _Watson’s Magazine_ of August: “Is it true\r\nthat railroad corporations insure the lives of the railroad mail\r\nclerks?” I cannot speak for the railroad corporations, but it was\r\ndeveloped in court here that the St. Lawrence Broom & Manufacturing Co.,\r\nthe largest corporation in this section, has the lives of its employes\r\ninsured for its benefit. This company employs a large number of men and\r\nboys and has never made any provisions for their protection against the\r\ninclemency of the weather, or the many dangers of machinery that might\r\nbe averted.\r\n\r\nI was an employe of this company for fifteen years and have seen a\r\nnumber of men and boys mangled and maimed for life, but it was not known\r\nuntil quite recently that the corporation received insurance for every\r\nemploye that got crippled. A boy got his hand cut off and sued the\r\ncompany for damages and it was clearly proven that the employes were\r\ninsured for the benefit of the company.\r\n\r\n\r\nMust Have the “Jeffersonian.”\r\n\r\n  _D. H. Chamberlain, Harriston, Miss._\r\n\r\nA few days ago I saw in the Memphis _Commercial-Appeal_ that you had\r\nsevered your connection with _Watson’s Magazine_. I am a subscriber and\r\nhave taken the Magazine solely on account of your Editorials, which I\r\nregard as the finest and most forceful I ever read in any Magazine. My\r\nsubscription is about run out and if you are no longer connected with\r\nthe publication I do not care to renew. This is my reason for making\r\nthis inquiry, and I will be glad to hear the report is untrue. If it is\r\ncorrect let me know if it will be your purpose to edit a similar\r\nperiodical. In that event you can count on me as a subscriber, even if\r\nthe subscription price should be increased to $5.00 per annum.\r\n\r\nI think you are doing a great and necessary work in your attempts to\r\narouse the people to the dangers that now menace the liberties of this\r\nunhappy land, “to hastening ills a prey.”\r\n\r\nThere is one point on which I am constrained to criticise you and that\r\nis your ill-advised attacks on W. J. Bryan, which is something I am\r\nutterly unable to understand.\r\n\r\nWhy do you do this when you both stand for the same things? It seems to\r\nme unfortunate, to say the least, that soldiers of the hosts of Reform\r\nshould turn their artillery upon each other when so much ammunition is\r\nneeded to fight the cohorts of Plutocracy, and in this connection\r\nnothing will ever be accomplished in the way of bringing this Government\r\nagain into the possession of the people if any such suicidal policy is\r\npursued. The reformers must get together if this Republic is to be\r\npreserved, if it is not even now too late to save it. Of this I am\r\ncertain: we have no time left us for internal dissensions, and I hope\r\nthat so splendid a soldier of the common good as yourself, will, in the\r\nfuture, refrain from stirring up discord in the ranks of Reform, and\r\nreserve your ammunition entirely for our enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to Gins.\r\n\r\n  _R. W. Barkley, New York City._\r\n\r\n  November 12, 1906.\r\n\r\nI note that you are proposed as President of the Cotton Association. I\r\nhave read your Magazine from the first number until Mann got it, and I\r\nknow your desire to benefit the South. I control the patent rights on a\r\ncotton gin which works on a new principle and which leaves the cotton in\r\nnatural lengths, thereby enhancing the price to the planter by one to\r\nfive cents per pound. The gin can be run by hand, or by power, and a few\r\nfarmers can own one in common and thereby earn money by ginning their\r\nown cotton. The gin consists of “mechanism for gradually opening and\r\nloosening the cotton fibres while still attached to the seeds, with\r\nmeans for thereafter removing the seeds.” Just take a little cotton and\r\ngradually pull the fibres apart, without, however, separating them from\r\nthe seed, until you have a large puff ball and then see how easily they\r\ncome off at the seed. Well, that is what this machine does. No “gin cut”\r\ncotton in it. Seed practically unhurt, also. Am looking for money\r\nwherewith to build a large machine, (the inventor made the working model\r\nby hand himself); it does the work fairly well, but it is getting to be\r\nram-shackle for demonstration purposes, and then for capital wherewith\r\nto work the gin commercially. Such a gin ought to interest you and also\r\nthe Cotton Association.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.--Having just been run through one new and improved\r\ngin--known as _Town Topics_--and having been badly “gin cut” myself,\r\nhave but slight inclination for new inventions of the gin variety.\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting Used to It.\r\n\r\n  _S.

Sikes, Ocilla, Georgia._\r\n\r\nI have your card of November 10th, advising me of your withdrawal from\r\n_Watson’s Magazine_, and of your intention of publishing in the near\r\nfuture WATSON’S JEFFERSONIAN. I desire to express my sympathy for you in\r\nyour recent trouble with the New York publication, and to assure you of\r\nmy friendship and best wishes for you in your new enterprise, “THE\r\nJEFFERSONIAN.”\r\n\r\nI feel sure that you have been treated very unfairly by those New York\r\npeople, and I feel a spirit of resentment for you, and I am to-day\r\nwriting them to discontinue mailing _Watson’s Magazine_ to me, and to\r\nerase my name from their list of subscribers. (Copy of letter enclosed.)\r\n\r\nI would feel worse for you over this transaction than I do if it were\r\nnot for the fact you have been unfairly treated and falsely accused so\r\nmany times during the last ten or fifteen years, until I suppose you\r\nhave to some extent become toughened so that you can stand such\r\ntreatment better than the average man, and I see very plainly now, and\r\nhave seen for quite a while past, that the current of public sentiment\r\nis rapidly drifting your way. I desire to offer you all the\r\nencouragement I possibly can in the noble work you are doing--educating\r\nthe common people of the country on the public issues that are now\r\nfacing the American people, and in this connection I will state to you\r\nthat I have been with you, so far as my ability extends, in this battle,\r\nand on some occasions have been severely criticised for taking your part\r\nand standing by the principles of original democracy in the days when\r\nthe Democratic Party was seeking to destroy the principles upon which\r\nour government was founded. Of course I will subscribe for the\r\nJEFFERSONIAN. I want the first copy that is printed and each succeeding\r\nissue. Mail me a few sample copies, and I think I can induce some others\r\nto subscribe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  (Copy.)\r\n\r\n  November 14, 1906.\r\n\r\n  Editor Watson’s Magazine, New York.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:--After reading and carefully considering the recent\r\ndifferences between you and the Honorable Thos. E. Watson, I wish to say\r\nto you that I think Mr. Watson has been treated very unfairly. I am a\r\ngreat admirer of Mr. Watson and his writings, and this led me to\r\nsubscribe to the Magazine in its beginning. I have been highly pleased\r\nwith it, and especially so with Mr. Watson’s editorials, but as he has\r\nbeen forced to sever his connection with the Magazine, and as his\r\nwritings were the principle things which induced me to subscribe to the\r\nMagazine, I write to request that you erase my name from your list of\r\nsubscribers. If I remember correctly, my subscription is paid up to\r\nMarch 1st, 1907, but under the circumstances I do not wish another copy\r\nmailed to my address.\r\n\r\n  Very respectfully,\r\n\r\n  S. R. SIKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWatson Was Its Strength.\r\n\r\n  _V. L. Anthony, Jr., Hurtsboro, Ala._\r\n\r\nI subscribed for _Watson’s Magazine_ on account of your connection with\r\nit. Now, as you are no longer with it, I wish your new Magazine when you\r\nstart it.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The Gang” Insults the Readers.\r\n\r\n  _D. J. Henderson, Sr., Ocilla, Ga._\r\n\r\nWhen the stockholders of the _Watson’s Magazine_ attempted to restrict\r\nyou as Editor and Manager, causing you to sever your connection with it,\r\nthey struck, what I call, a death blow to the Magazine. All of its\r\nreaders who believe in pure Jeffersonian Democracy felt the insult as\r\nkeenly as you. I enclose you copy of a letter I sent last week to\r\nDeFrance, ordering mine discontinued. I am a subscriber to the Weekly\r\n_Jeffersonian_ and will be to the Magazine you contemplate starting in\r\nAtlanta as soon as the first issue is out.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the _Ocilla Star_, whom I asked you some time back to\r\nexchange your Magazine with, has, since that time, “passed over the\r\nRiver to rest in the shade.” The paper will be continued by his two\r\nyoung sons, who, I know, if not doing so, will be pleased to exchange\r\nwith _The Jeffersonian_.\r\n\r\nMay the blessings of Heaven be upon you and yours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  (Copy.)\r\n\r\n  Ocilla, Ga., Oct. 24, 1906.\r\n\r\n  Mr. C. Q. DeFrance, New York City.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:--Please strike my name from the list of subscribers to the\r\n_Watson Magazine_. I learn the stockholders endeavored to place\r\nrestrictions on Mr. Watson as Editor and Manager, and he, for that\r\nreason, severed his connection with it. Thank God for that. I am glad to\r\nknow he had so much manhood about him. Tom Watson is one among the\r\ngreatest statesmen the United States has. It is a source of satisfaction\r\nto know that he will neither speak nor write with a corporation muzzle\r\non. When the stockholders attempted to restrict Mr. Watson in his\r\nEditorials for the Magazine, they didn’t only insult him, but they\r\ninsulted every reader of it who believes in the pure Jeffersonian\r\nprinciples which Mr. Watson so ably advocates and defends. I would be\r\nproud of Tom Watson were he from any other section of the Union. He\r\nbeing a Southern man and a Georgian at that, I am exceedingly proud of\r\nhim. I fear somebody has been taken upon the Mount and shown the\r\nglorious things the railroads will do if they will only fall down and\r\nworship them. If _no Watson_ is with the Magazine then _no Magazine for\r\nme_.\r\n\r\n  Respectfully,\r\n\r\n  D. J. HENDERSON, SR.\r\n\r\n\r\n“It Would Be a Noble Charity.”\r\n\r\n  _Chas. D. Hunt, Gueydan, La._\r\n\r\nReading with interest your valuable editorials in the October number and\r\nthe most striking and interesting subject, “It Would be a Noble\r\nCharity”--here you have treated a subject in a light that any person\r\ncould not help from shielding with an honest heart, with a strong desire\r\nin mind to spread the cause of charity, but you have almost been selfish\r\nwith your subject. What of the territory bordering along the Gulf of\r\nMexico? That is, the extreme portion.\r\n\r\nHere we have settlers of almost ancient times. They are not altogether\r\nuncivilized, but are not able to meet the demands of our educated\r\nrequirements. Hence are we to still keep them back or are we to give\r\nthem a helping hand? These people know nothing of education and its help\r\nin life, but toil with an earnest heart to maintain _merely_ a _scant\r\nliving_ and to bring the younger class up in their own path.\r\n\r\nI think if the Humane Society would stop and think deeply in regard to\r\nthe young boys and girls that spend their school days in hard labor out\r\nof school there would be something done to protect them and give them a\r\nchance for a better future than is now before them.\r\n\r\nIt would be surprising to anyone who has had the advantages of education\r\nand _really_ felt its _real value_ in life to stroll along the prairies\r\nand see just how many bright young boys and girls are out of touch with\r\nthe educated world. Why? Their parents are not able to aid them to\r\nsecure an education, but are more than willing.\r\n\r\nDo you not think much could be done in both mountain and prairie\r\nterritories?\r\n\r\n\r\nWants Only the Real Thing.\r\n\r\n  _Burton H. Jeffers, Rose, N. Y._\r\n\r\nHaving read in the _Missouri World_ that you had ceased writing for\r\n_Watson’s Magazine_, I was greatly surprised. I had supposed that you\r\nowned the Magazine, and had taken great pleasure in securing\r\nsubscriptions for it in this vicinity. Some of those subscriptions have\r\njust expired, and the subscribers say they don’t want it again if you\r\nare not going to write for it. That would seem to sound the death knell\r\nof the now so-called _Watson’s Magazine_.\r\n\r\nWhen you start your new magazine send me a sample copy, and I will\r\nendeavor to give your subscription list a little boost. I would also\r\nlike a few sample copies of your weekly paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou Shall Hear Again.\r\n\r\n  _J. J. Hunt, El Paso, Tex._\r\n\r\nLooking forward and hoping to get the November number of your Magazine,\r\nI hear, verbally, that you have severed your connection with that\r\nperiodical, and I don’t care now whether it ever appears again, for what\r\nI read in it was what you wrote, little else. I know you quit your\r\nassociation there for good cause and that your work will not end, and\r\nbelieve I shall hear from you again. I dare say two thirds of the\r\nreaders of _Watson’s Magazine_, like myself, will care little for it\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nWhile I’m traveling, please know that I’m still a citizen of good old\r\nGeorgia, living at 257 South Pryor Street, Atlanta.\r\n\r\n\r\nSamples of the Replies DeFrance May Expect to Get to Begging Letters.\r\n\r\n(Copy.)\r\n\r\n  Boaz, Ala., Nov. 16, 1906.\r\n\r\n  C. Q. DeFrance.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:--In this paragraph you say too much to get my help; you say\r\nthat Mr. Watson’s backers cared nothing for Mr. Watson’s “ideas.” But\r\nthe money which you hoped to get out of those who do care for Mr. Watson\r\nand his “ideas” was the object in view. Had it not been for Mr. Watson\r\nand the principles he advocated I would not have been a subscriber. This\r\nand the fact that Mr. Watson was forced to resign because of non-payment\r\nof his salary and what you say in the fourth paragraph forever settles\r\nit with me. When Mr. Watson betrays the people’s cause or trust for any\r\ncause I am done, for I would never confide in another man as I have in\r\nhim, but he will never forsake the people.\r\n\r\n  Yours truly,\r\n\r\n  T. B. MOSLEY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(Copy.)\r\n\r\n  Mr. C. Q. DeFrance, Business Manager, New York City, N. Y.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:--I received the November number of the _Watson’s Magazine_ a\r\nfew days ago, and your circular letter and subscription blanks today,\r\nand in reply would say that I am one of those who much prefer the play\r\nof Hamlet with the Prince of Denmark left in.\r\n\r\nFurther comments are unnecessary. My subscription expires February,\r\n1907. Please discontinue same with the November number received.\r\n\r\n  Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n  A. A. DELONG.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(Copy.)\r\n\r\n  _Watson’s Magazine, 121 W. 42nd Street, New York, N. Y._\r\n\r\nGentlemen:--You will please discontinue my subscription to _Watson’s\r\nMagazine_.\r\n\r\nI subscribed to this periodical in order to read Mr. Watson’s\r\neditorials; and, inasmuch as he is no longer identified with this\r\npublication, it is useless to send it to me any longer.\r\n\r\n  Very truly,\r\n\r\n  BURGESS SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWants the Jeffersonian.\r\n\r\n  _Chas. E. Harris, Alton, Ill._\r\n\r\nI was very much surprised on buying _Watson’s Magazine_ for November to\r\nfind that you were no longer connected with it as editor. Of course I\r\nwill have no further use for the Magazine as I only bought it in the\r\nfirst place for your writings.\r\n\r\nI saw in one of the St. Louis papers that you intended to start another\r\nMagazine and call it WATSON’S JEFFERSONIAN. Please advise me if this is\r\ntrue and when it will be ready for publication, as I want you to put me\r\ndown on your subscription list.\r\n\r\nI hope to cast my first vote for you and Bryan in 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Sham for Him.\r\n\r\n  _Benjamin H. Hill, West Point, Ga._\r\n\r\nSome time ago I subscribed for your splendid Magazine solely and only to\r\nget to read your articles therein and I notice to-day’s number, with one\r\nexception, contains nothing from your able pen. Without your articles I\r\nwould not give ten cents a year for it, in fact don’t want it at any\r\nprice. I desire to read after you, but don’t want this other trash.\r\n\r\nI regret your trouble and hope it will yet prove for your benefit and\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Jeffersonian is the Answer.\r\n\r\n  _Chas. Buttlar, Oakland, Cal._\r\n\r\nI have been a regular purchaser of your Magazine from its beginning, and\r\nit is with the deepest regret that I learn that you have withdrawn from\r\nthe Magazine. I presume that the enemies of truth have destroyed its\r\npublication as they have done heretofore with others.\r\n\r\nWill you kindly inform me, also, whether you will start a new Magazine\r\nor paper by which we may enjoy the education that you have given us? I\r\nwish you success and strength to overcome all opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nHamlet Without the Dane.\r\n\r\n  _H. G. Sumner, Passaic, N. J._\r\n\r\n_Watson’s Magazine_ without Watson is of course no longer _Watson’s\r\nMagazine_. I haven’t seen the November number, but it must be like\r\n“Hamlet” with Hamlet left out.\r\n\r\nI am proud of having been one of the faithful in 1904, when I heard you\r\nspeak at Jersey City and again in that matchless “old fashioned stump\r\nspeech” at the Grand Central Palace in New York, where I managed to jam\r\nmyself through the crowd on the platform and get hold of your hand for a\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nThe monthly visits of your Magazine were like those of a dear friend\r\ndropping in for an evening to discuss matters which should be of the\r\ngravest concern to every true American. I have the numbers all bound in\r\nvolumes, but now my set is complete much sooner than I had anticipated.\r\n\r\nA few minutes ago I took up a copy of _The Public_, in which I saw a\r\nparagraph to the effect that you would soon start a new Magazine. I hope\r\nthis may be true, and I want to be one of the first subscribers, for I\r\nam anxious for the continuation of the “Life of Jackson” and for more of\r\nyour Editorials.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a Constant Reader.\r\n\r\n  _Jas. E. Dillon, Otwell, Ind._\r\n\r\nToo late I learned the sad story of _Watson’s Magazine_. I have been a\r\nsubscriber to it from the first number, and I did not want to miss a\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nI sent a long list of names to it a few days before I found it out, for\r\nsample copies. But it has lost its attraction to me and I hope such men\r\nas DeFrance and Mann will soon be relegated.\r\n\r\nI have enclosed a few names that might subscribe to the new JEFFERSONIAN\r\nMAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nI hope you will have success in spreading the truth and nothing but the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n\r\nWants a “Watson’s” With a Watson in It\r\n\r\n  _H. C. Britt, Sparta, Ga._\r\n\r\nI have been informed that you would send to the present subscribers to\r\n_Watson’s Magazine_, if they so desired, your new publication, free of\r\ncost, for the time for which they had paid their subscriptions to the\r\nMagazine. I am a subscriber to the Magazine, and have been from the date\r\nof its very first issue, and my subscription is paid to the\r\ncorresponding date in 1907.\r\n\r\nI took the Magazine because of your connection with it. I would\r\nappreciate the opportunity of getting acquainted with your new\r\nMagazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReturning Thanks to My Friends\r\n\r\n\r\nShouldering the responsibilities and the financial burden of a new\r\nmagazine, is a serious matter. As nearly everybody will understand, it\r\ninvolves tens of thousands of dollars in the way of necessary expense,\r\nand whether you will ever see that money again depends entirely upon\r\ncircumstances over which you yourself have nothing like _absolute_\r\ncontrol. There are already so many brilliant and beautiful magazines\r\ncirculating throughout the Union, that establishing another is a venture\r\nthat borders upon temerity.\r\n\r\nBut in my case there was no alternative. _It had to be done._ Flesh and\r\nblood could not bear the infamous treatment which was being handed out\r\nto me by that fat rascal, Col. W. D. Mann, and that lean sneak, C. Q.\r\nDeFrance. _Out of consideration for the subscribers_, as well as in\r\njustice to myself, it was absolutely necessary that I should establish a\r\nmagazine of my own, which should extend to the subscribers of the New\r\nYork Magazine the privilege of securing the remainder of their terms\r\nfrom a magazine which was, _in fact_, what the _name_ of the New York\r\nMagazine had led subscribers _to believe it to be_.\r\n\r\nTo have Mann and DeFrance publishing, in New York, a _Watson’s\r\nMagazine_, and securing money from thousands of innocent people, _who\r\nwould subscribe upon the faith of my name, and would then be told\r\nfalsehoods as to why I was no longer writing for it_, WOULD HAVE BEEN AN\r\nINTOLERABLE SITUATION.\r\n\r\nTo remain silent and acquiescent under those circumstances, would have\r\nbeen to make myself a party to the fraud. I understand that Col. Mann\r\nand C. Q. DeFrance are using, for themselves, the money sent to the\r\n_Watson’s Magazine_ by those who are not aware of the fact that there is\r\nno Watson connected with THAT Magazine. _If they do not extend to the\r\nsubscriber the option of getting his money back, or of having it sent to\r\nthe genuine Watson’s Magazine_, they will be cheats and swindlers; and\r\nthey ought to be made to plead on the criminal side of the Court, _where\r\nthe appearance of Col. Mann would not be considered extraordinary_.\r\n\r\nNot wanting to be a party to a fraud by making no effort to defeat it,\r\nand not having a disposition to lie down quietly while those two rascals\r\ntrampled upon me, I announced the purpose of establishing WATSON’S\r\nJEFFERSONIAN MAGAZINE. Of course it was hoped that my friends would\r\nstand by me. It was hoped that those subscribers who had gone to the\r\nMagazine in New York would follow my Magazine in Atlanta.\r\n\r\nDid the subscribers of the New York Magazine want a _real_ Watsonian\r\nMagazine, or was it _just any old magazine_ that they were after? Were\r\nthose subscribers men and women who had faith in me, and who were\r\nattached to myself, my work and my message? _Would they have sufficient\r\ninterest in the matter to sympathize with me, and follow me?_ These were\r\nthe questions. They could not be answered until the opportunity was\r\noffered _for the subscribers themselves to act_.\r\n\r\nWith grateful heart, I hereby return profound thanks to those steadfast\r\nand earnest comrades who have already enrolled themselves with WATSON’S\r\nJEFFERSONIAN MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nThese friends did not wait for a sample copy; they did not wait for the\r\nday of publication. _They had faith._ They knew in advance what my\r\nMagazine would be. THEY HAD CONFIDENCE. They knew perfectly well that\r\ntheir money would be safe in my hands. Therefore, from California to\r\nNorth Carolina and from Florida to Michigan, they have poured in upon me\r\ntheir letters of sympathy and encouragement. And together with these\r\nletters they sent remittances to cover their subscriptions in advance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom so great a number it is difficult, and perhaps not quite fair, to\r\nsingle out individuals, but as it is my intention to carry in the\r\nMagazine from month to month, a Department in which those who are most\r\nactive in their support of the Magazine will be mentioned by name, a few\r\nwill be mentioned now. Others will be mentioned later.\r\n\r\nI want every one of my friends who have written me, to feel that their\r\nencouragement and support is profoundly appreciated.\r\n\r\nYou naturally inquire, _who was the very first subscriber to_ WATSON’S\r\nJEFFERSONIAN MAGAZINE?\r\n\r\nDR. CICERO GIBSON, THOMSON, GA.\r\n\r\nFollowing closely after Dr. Gibson, came a good many others who arrived\r\nso nearly together that it would perhaps be unjust to some to say which\r\nwas literally the first-comer, yet I cannot refrain from selecting a few\r\nfor special mention.\r\n\r\nThere was my gallant and loyal friend of LaGrange, Ga., Dr. Frank\r\nRidley, whose letter I am going to print in full:\r\n\r\n“Please know that I am in thorough sympathy with you in the matter of\r\nthe Magazine contention, and all other matters.\r\n\r\n“I have written to the New York office of the _Watson’s Magazine_,\r\ninstructing them to discontinue sending me their paper. I am enclosing\r\ncheck for $1.50 for WATSON’S JEFFERSONIAN MAGAZINE. With sentiments of\r\nmy continued warm regard and friendship.\r\n\r\n“P. S. Please see that my subscription begins with the first issue.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen there was the very warm-hearted H. J. Mullins, Franklin, Tenn.;\r\nthere was J. J. Gordy of Richland, Ga., who had rendered such faithful\r\nservice for the New York Magazine, and who transferred his zeal and\r\ninfluence immediately to the JEFFERSONIAN; there was whole-souled Frank\r\nBurkett, of Okolona, Miss.; and there was that gray-haired but\r\nwarm-hearted veteran, Thos. H. Tibbles, of Nebraska.\r\n\r\nFrom the Empire State, Texas, came the cheering response of sturdy\r\nMilton Park. From Salem, Va., W. H. Tinsley spoke words of\r\nencouragement. And my good old friend, Allison W. Smith, of North\r\nGeorgia, went to work as earnestly and as promptly for the new Magazine\r\nas he had done for the old.\r\n\r\nAnd how can I fail to mention Paul Dixon of Chilicothe, Mo? _A truer man\r\ndoes not live._ Of the many who have stood by me at this juncture and\r\nshown a willingness to co-operate, none has been more emphatic than\r\nDixon & Lankford, who enjoy the distinction of publishing one of the\r\nthree Mid-Road Populist papers which stood the storm, and did not go\r\ndown in consequence of the awful mistake and of Fusion.\r\n\r\nFrom Los Angeles, Cal., came a heart-warming letter from Lucian L.\r\nKnight, which you will find elsewhere in this number of the Magazine.\r\nFrom Athens, Ga., came a most welcome letter from A. D. Cheney; and his\r\nbright boy, Jean Cheney, took up the work of canvassing his community,\r\nwith results so extremely helpful to me that I mention his name in\r\ngrateful recognition of his service.\r\n\r\nFrom A. G. Thurman Zabel, of Petersburg, Mich., comes the following:\r\n\r\n“I saw a notice in the _Missouri World_, that you were about to publish\r\na new Magazine. Enclosed find remittance for which send me your Magazine\r\nas long as that pays for, and then let me know, and I will remit for it\r\nfor a longer term. I am glad to learn that you will continue your good\r\nwork.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom Kentucky comes a cordial word from that veteran editor and gifted\r\ngentleman, Hon. Henry Watterson, who, on the eve of his departure for\r\nEurope, drops a line to the Atlanta management of the Magazine to say:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Watson has few greater admirers or better friends than I am and\r\nwhenever the _Courier-Journal_ can do anything to advance his personal\r\ninterests, it is always at his hands.”\r\n\r\nJudge John J. Hunt, one of those level-headed Democratic leaders who did\r\nhis best to prevent the awful mistake that was made by the Men in\r\nControl, in 1896, was swift with his assurances of hearty co-operation\r\nand support. And my old college friend. Alex. Keese, of Atlanta, _was\r\nnot behind anybody_ in the warmth and vigor of his protestations against\r\nthe wrong which had been done me by those knaves in New York.\r\n\r\nNor should I forget stanch W. S. Morgan, of Hardy, Ark., nor J. M.\r\nMallett of Cleburne, Tex., both of whom were emphatic in their\r\ndenunciation of the New York outrage:--Nor yet sturdy Jo. A. Parker.\r\n\r\nFrom far-off Seattle, State of Washington, the voice of _The Patriarch_,\r\nwas heard in scathing condemnation of what had been done by Col. Mann\r\nand DeFrance; and from New Jersey, Dr. Geo. H. Cromie was equally\r\nemphatic.\r\n\r\nMy good friend, C. E. Parker, of Bainbridge, not only enlisted under my\r\nbanner, turning his back upon those New York knaves, but he _remitted\r\nthe largest individual check that was sent_--$13.80--and the largest\r\nnumber of subscribers received in any one remittance.\r\n\r\n_From the Hawaiian Islands_, came a cordial hand-shake from that veteran\r\nof the Reform Wars, JOHN M. HORNER. From Paris, France, spoke the\r\nsympathetic voice of JOHN ADAMS THAYER--the brainy, nervy man who\r\nachieved such a wonderful success for _Everybody’s Magazine_.\r\n\r\nNor must I omit from the Roll of Honor the name of PROF. M. W. PARKS,\r\nPresident of the Georgia Normal and Industrial School, and President\r\nalso of the Georgia Educational Association. His letter was a noble\r\ntribute which I highly value.\r\n\r\nTaylor J. Shields, of Vineland, Ala., has my sincere thanks for his\r\ngenerous words.\r\n\r\nBay City, Michigan, is the home of an ardent, personally unknown friend\r\nwhose hand I hope some day to shake--his name is Francis F. McGinniss.\r\n\r\nAnd I must find room to mention my untiring friend, Col. W. A. Huff, of\r\nMacon; R. E. Thompson, of Toomsuber, Miss.; J. S. Ward, Jr., of\r\nThomasville; Ben Hill, of West Point, Ga., and Clarence Cunningham, of\r\nWaterloo, S. C.; Rev. R. L. Benson, Clay Center, Kan.; H. G. Sumner,\r\nPassaic, N. J.; Chas. Butler, Oakland, Cal.; Theron Fisk, Sioux Falls,\r\nS. D.; and Prof. Z. I. Fitzpatrick, of Madison, Ga.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is W. F. Smith, of Flovilla, Ga., who has never flickered\r\nin his loyal comradeship any more than has that noble old Roman, Gen.\r\nWilliam Phillips, of Marietta.\r\n\r\nHere is a specimen of the way they are writing to me and below it a\r\nsample of how they are writing to the bogus _Watson’s Magazine_:\r\n\r\n  Dixie, Ga., Nov. 23, 1906.\r\n\r\n  Hon. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:--I am writing the New York office today cancelling my\r\nsubscription to the counterfeit _Watson’s Magazine_. Old man Mann, and\r\nDeFrance are a set of fools, if for one moment they entertained the\r\nthought that they could detain the followers of the _real_ Tom Watson on\r\ntheir subscription list. The thing can’t be done. When the readers of\r\nthe New York _Watson’s Magazine_ find out the truth about the manner in\r\nwhich they treated the genuine Tom Watson, you will see them leaving\r\nlike rats leaving a sinking ship. The idea of _Watson’s Magazine_ with\r\nWatson left out! Might as well try to run a locomotive steam engine\r\nwithout steam. Tom Watson was the steam--the electricity--the\r\nspirit--yes, the very life of the Magazine, and without him its name is\r\nDennis. It is a burning shame, the way they have treated you.\r\n\r\nI am sending my check for $1.50 for your JEFFERSONIAN MAGAZINE, and wish\r\nfor it the success that you so justly deserve. I hope to be able to get\r\nothers interested in the new publication. You have thousands and\r\nthousands of true and tried friends in old Georgia, and in fact, in\r\nevery State in the United States, and the numbers are growing all the\r\ntime, and every effort of the enemies of truth to put you in the\r\nbackground only brings you more prominently before the masses as the\r\nfriend of Good Government.\r\n\r\nMay God abundantly bless and prosper you and yours, is the sincere\r\nprayer of your friend and brother,\r\n\r\n  (Signed) G.

I do not care to\r\nread your slanderous vaporing about Tom Watson. You will soon find out\r\nthat, bad as you try to make him out to be, he was really the Magazine,\r\nand without him it will sink in the cesspool of public contempt--as it\r\nshould do.\r\n\r\n  Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n  (Signed) G.

As\r\nMr. Watson is no longer _the Magazine_, will you please discontinue my\r\nsubscription and return to me the three month’s unexpired subscription\r\nprice, and oblige,\r\n\r\n  Yours truly,\r\n\r\n  J.

I\r\n  noticed your proposition to make good the subscription to the _Watson\r\n  Magazine_. I think mine will be out in June, but I got it at club\r\n  rates and _don’t want to be a burden to you_, but I don’t want a\r\n  _Watson’s_ without a Watson in it, so you send me the WATSON’S\r\n  JEFFERSONIAN MAGAZINE, and I’ll see you and pay for six months at\r\n  least, as I have great confidence in you as a reform leader and want\r\n  to help what little I can.\r\n\r\n  Yours truly,\r\n\r\n  J.

Stembridge, of Milledgeville, is good enough to say, in\r\nsubscribing, “you are doing more for the Reform cause than any other man\r\nin the United States.” “If ever anybody wants to whip you,” writes\r\nfriend M. S. Chiles, of Macon, in remitting his subscription, “I will\r\nbe pleased to push you aside and say, ‘Whip me first.’” “I would not\r\ncarry the New York publication from the postoffice,” says W. W.\r\nShamhart, of Newton, Ill. Dr. R. R. Smith, of Burtons, Miss., doesn’t\r\n“like the jingle of the editorials” of the bogus _Watson’s Magazine_ for\r\nNovember and would like to see any response that I may make. Verily, he\r\nshall see it. J. K. Sears, of McCoy, Oregon, wants a Magazine “published\r\nat Atlanta by Tom Watson and not by Col. Mann at New York.” “Please\r\nenter my name from now till doomsday,” writes Prof. J. H. Camp, of\r\nChicago, who at the same time cancels his subscription to what he calls\r\n“the New York dummy.” Dr. J. D. Allen, of Milledgeville, enrolls himself\r\nand says, “send me the first copy.” “I shall always be a subscriber,”\r\nwrites W. W. Bennett, Esq., of Baxley. “The reason I subscribed to the\r\nother Magazine,” says W. W. Arendell, of Gause, Tex., “was that you were\r\nthe editor,” so of course he wants the genuine WATSON’S JEFFERSONIAN. B.\r\nL. Milling, of Neal, Ga., was a subscriber to _Watson’s Magazine_ of New\r\nYork from the first issue, “and would continue to be, had it not been\r\nthat ‘the gang’ tried to impose upon you,” he writes. Likewise C. W.\r\nKing, of Rome, Ga., “only subscribed to the New York publication on\r\naccount of your colors flying at the mast-head, so”--he writes--“of\r\ncourse I wish to enter my name as a subscriber to your new venture.” H.\r\nGillabaugh, of Missoula, Montana, thinks the bogus _Watson’s Magazine_\r\nas at present conducted, is “like a church with the devil as pastor.”\r\n“No more of C. Q. DeFrance for me,” writes J. T. Melbone, of Huntingdon,\r\nTenn. A cordial message greets me from Captain Jack Crawford, the\r\npoet-scout. A. Benoit, of Shreveport, La., sends $10, with the request\r\nthat $1.50 be credited to him for subscription, and the balance be used\r\n“for the cause.” From the little city of Flippen, Ga., a list of 25\r\nsubscribers to the bogus _Watson’s Magazine_ goes forward to DeFrance. A\r\ncopy of the letter is sent me with the request that they be enrolled on\r\nthe JEFFERSONIAN.\r\n\r\nAnd so they go.\r\n\r\nIt is something to have lived and worked in such a way as to have won\r\ntrue hearts in every part of the Union.\r\n\r\nGod knows how much I appreciate these stanch friends, many of whom I\r\nhave never seen and will never personally know.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy lady friends--God bless them!--have been just as prompt and just as\r\nearnest in taking my side in this struggle against a rascally New York\r\nmillionaire and a treacherous sneak who are trying to make off with\r\n_Watson’s Magazine_.\r\n\r\nShall I ever forget the warm-hearted letter of MISS SALLIE T. PARRISH,\r\nof Adel, Ga?\r\n\r\nOr that of MISS MATTIE V. MITCHELL, of St. Louis, Mo?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVarious subscription agencies, as well as newspapers and magazines, had\r\nmade clubbing rates with _Watson’s Magazine_ while I was with it. Of\r\ncourse Col. Mann and DeFrance would like to have these clubbing rates\r\nstand, and would like to have the revenue coming from those who are\r\nstill subscribing to _Watson’s Magazine in ignorance of the fact that it\r\nnow has no Watson connected with it_. The managers of these subscription\r\nagencies, and the managers of those newspapers are necessarily\r\ncompelled, _as men of honor_, to hold up all subscription money coming\r\nfrom those who wish a _Watson’s Magazine_, until the managers of the\r\nclubbing rates shall have notified the subscriber that Mr. Watson is no\r\nlonger with the New York Magazine that bears his name, but is now\r\npublishing in Atlanta, the JEFFERSONIAN MAGAZINE. In other words, as a\r\nmatter of common honesty, the subscribers should be put on notice that\r\nthe New York Magazine which bears my name, has been taken away from me\r\nby Col. Mann and DeFrance, and the subscriber should therefore have the\r\noption of sending his money directly to the JEFFERSONIAN MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nTHE UNION LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, of New York, promptly assured me that\r\nthis would be its attitude in the matter. They will hold the money until\r\nthe subscriber shall have elected which of the two magazines he really\r\nwanted. This was very honorable in the Union Library Association of New\r\nYork, and the promptness with which the manager took that position, is\r\nhighly appreciated by me. I give Mr. Bowman’s letter in full:\r\n\r\n  New York, Nov. 26, 1906.\r\n\r\n  Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:--Yours of the 23rd inst. is at hand. You evidently did not\r\nreceive our letter, although we have an acknowledgment of receipt of\r\nsame from your manager.\r\n\r\nWe wrote you voluntarily that we would be glad to do just what you now\r\nask us to do. That is, endeavor to switch subscriptions for _Watson’s\r\nMagazine_ to WATSON’S JEFFERSONIAN MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nIt seems to us that if anyone wants your Magazine they will not be\r\nsatisfied with Colonel Mann’s continuation of the original. It is a\r\nrather unfortunate state of affairs, but no doubt in time it will get\r\nstraightened out and everyone know the true facts in the case.\r\n\r\nWe can assure you of our interest in the matter, and will be glad to do\r\nwhat we can to throw business your way.\r\n\r\n  Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n  CHAS.

In fact, I cannot see how the\r\nmanagers of those various clubbing arrangements, which are now standing\r\nin the name of _Watson’s Magazine_, can, as a matter of common justice\r\nto me, _as well as to the subscriber_, turn over the money to Col.

It has good river\r\n  connection, and is reached by two railroads; while three more are in\r\n  the course of construction; which goes to show that the present\r\n  development and future prospect of the city affords a rare opportunity\r\n  for investments in real estate.\r\n\r\n  One 65-foot lot on Shotwell street sold thirty days ago for $1,500,\r\n  will now bring over $2,000.\r\n\r\n  Some of the greatest fortunes in the South were made by prompt,\r\n  discriminating investors in this line; and we feel certain that the\r\n  investor has never been afforded an opportunity more golden in\r\n  prospect than is afforded in this sale of choice building lots. We are\r\n  offering on easy monthly payments\r\n\r\n  300 Choice Building Lots at $50.00 each.\r\n\r\n  These lots are conveniently located in the eastern section of the\r\n  city, on Planters, Water, Broughton and Shotwell streets; and within a\r\n  short distance from Circle Drive, Bainbridge’s most popular driveway.\r\n  An ideal place for a home.\r\n\r\n  Some Facts About Bainbridge.\r\n\r\n  Bainbridge is located on Flint river, deep water short channel to port\r\n  on Gulf, and enjoys the same freight advantages as Columbus, and is\r\n  entitled to Port rates, for which Atlanta has striven in vain. As a\r\n  commercial center, Bainbridge enjoys marked success. Within the past\r\n  five years have been added such industries as a large Oil Mill, two\r\n  Barrel Factories, Sash, Door and Blind Factory, Ice Factory, Hardwood\r\n  Plant, Corn Mill, Foundry and Machine Works, Canning Factory, two\r\n  Brick Factories, Syrup Refinery, Machine Shops and Car\r\n  Works--representing an invested capital of nearly half a million\r\n  dollars. All these industries came to Bainbridge because of its\r\n  natural advantages, and not because of money inducement by Bainbridge\r\n  people.\r\n\r\n  Its location on the river, railroad facilities, new roads, rich\r\n  farming section, etc., are bound to make Bainbridge the largest town\r\n  in South Georgia. It is surrounded by the richest farming lands in\r\n  Georgia--the foundation of the wealth of any town--a fine cotton\r\n  country; and the home of the famous Georgia Cane Syrup and Sumatra\r\n  tobacco. The climate is mild and healthy, and truck crops mature early\r\n  enough for fancy prices ahead of the main crop.\r\n\r\n  It is the Only Spot in the United States Which Successfully Grows\r\n  Sumatra Tobacco.\r\n\r\n  Farmers obtain $500 per acre for their tobacco crops. One New York\r\n  firm, A. Cohn & Co., has a million dollars invested in their plant to\r\n  grow and handle this product. Less than one-third of this land is now\r\n  cultivated. There is room for 10 times the present population, and\r\n  these great opportunities are certain to attract farmers to this\r\n  section.\r\n\r\n  Waiman Hotel, Bainbridge, Ga., Nov. 26, ’06.\r\n\r\n  MR. F. R. GRAHAM, City.\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir:--Before leaving town on the early A. M. train, I wish to\r\n  request that you reserve ten lots adjoining those I bought of you\r\n  today, as I think I can place them with some of my friends in New York\r\n  who are looking for a “dead sure thing” as an investment. My personal\r\n  inspection of the property today and that adjoining it, which you\r\n  showed me, leads me to believe that your section is ideally located\r\n  and that it has a brilliant future. I have covered this southern\r\n  territory for six years and have seen many sections grow rapidly, but\r\n  I can honestly say that I regard Bainbridge as the best part of South\r\n  Georgia, both as a natural business center and residential section,\r\n  saying nothing of its agricultural qualifications; and I see no reason\r\n  why you should not soon have a greater Bainbridge, as we have a\r\n  greater New York. Thanking you again for that delightful ride, I am,\r\n\r\n  Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n  (Signed) THOS. H. HEARD,\r\n\r\n  New York.\r\n\r\n  For Further Information, Address\r\n\r\n  F. R. GRAHAM, Dept. A., Bainbridge, Ga.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BLUE RIBBON\r\n  BED SPRINGS\r\n\r\n  The Proper Foundation\r\n\r\n  for a comfortable bed is as necessary as a good foundation for a\r\n  building. No matter what kind of mattress you are using, it will be\r\n  uncomfortable without the right spring bed.\r\n\r\n  The cone shape all-wire is the logical construction for the highest\r\n  comfort. When made of a high class wire, properly tempered, it retains\r\n  its resiliency and lasting qualities; and combined with the superior\r\n  construction it conforms to the body, aiding a good mattress to\r\n  produce perfect repose.\r\n\r\n  In the BLUE RIBBON Spring we are using the finest pattern known to the\r\n  scientific world. The construction is so superior that it has been\r\n  adopted by the U. S. Government as a basis for all of its fine\r\n  upholstered work, in chairs, couches, and steamer fittings.\r\n\r\n  The BLUE RIBBON Spring is made of an especially prepared steel wire of\r\n  the highest quality, depending for its strength like the Damascus\r\n  Blade, upon the fineness of its temper.\r\n\r\n  It is not too light for the heaviest person, and not too heavy for the\r\n  lightest person, conforming absolutely to the shape. The Spirals are\r\n  so joined and constructed that they act independently, supporting the\r\n  body at every point. This independent action of each spiral makes it\r\n  the only practical construction where two persons of different weights\r\n  occupy the same bed. It entirely eliminates the tendency to roll\r\n  towards the center of the bed. Each person achieves the maximum of\r\n  comfort to be derived from individual beds.\r\n\r\n  As a test of its flexibility and the independent action of each cone,\r\n  lie on your back on the bare spring, stretching at full length, and\r\n  you cannot slip your hands between the small of the back and the\r\n  spring, neither will any part of the spring be affected except the\r\n  cones in direct contact with the body, so perfect is its construction.\r\n\r\n  The BLUE RIBBON Spring has a smooth and even surface supporting the\r\n  mattress at all points. It is bedbug proof, and has no cracks or\r\n  crevices in which vermin can collect.\r\n\r\n  We guarantee the BLUE RIBBON absolutely. On each spring is attached a\r\n  two-color tin tag guaranteeing the spring against sagging or breaking\r\n  for\r\n\r\n  FIVE YEARS.\r\n\r\n  We also give a thirty night trial as to general comfort.\r\n\r\n  The spring represented below is designed for wood beds or for iron\r\n  beds when wood slats are used.\r\n\r\n  We also manufacture the same spring with heavy iron slats--a slat\r\n  under each row of springs, for use on iron or brass beds.\r\n\r\n  For additional smoothness and beauty a woven wire top can be stretched\r\n  over the top of spring.\r\n\r\n  PRICES:\r\n\r\n  No. 2 Blue Ribbon Springs, as illustrated          $5.00\r\n  No. 2 Blue Ribbon Springs, with woven wire top      6.50\r\n  No. 5 Blue Ribbon Springs, for iron or brass beds   7.00\r\n  No. 5 Blue Ribbon Springs, woven wire top           8.50\r\n\r\n  Regular size for wood bed is 4 ft. 4 in. x 6 ft. 0 in. For iron bed, 4\r\n  ft. 6 in. x 6 ft. 1 in.\r\n\r\n  Prices quoted for special sizes on application.\r\n\r\n  If your dealer does not handle the BLUE RIBBON write to us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  Southern\r\n  Spring Bed Co.\r\n  ATLANTA, GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Right Mattress\r\n  Is Rarely Found by Accident.\r\n\r\n  Knowledge of the methods of mattress making, of the integrity of the\r\n  manufacturer, and the sincerity of the salesmen are essential to\r\n  correct buying. As a clean coat sometimes hides a dirty shirt so often\r\n  does a nice tick hide an inferior filling, dirty and unsanitary.\r\n\r\n  In the RED CROSS SANITARY FELT MATTRESS we have achieved the acme of\r\n  mattress making. Money cannot buy its superior. It is far more\r\n  comfortable and enduring than a hair mattress costing you fifty\r\n  dollars or more.\r\n\r\n  THE RED CROSS MATTRESS\r\n  IS BUILT TO STAND.\r\n\r\n  The RED CROSS is built of eight great layers of hand selected sheets\r\n  of Pure Staple Cotton. It is soft and elastic. It is non-absorbent and\r\n  vermin proof, and will outwear any mattress made, giving thorough\r\n  satisfaction and comfort. An occasional sun bath makes it everlasting.\r\n  It has a smooth even surface conforming to the body’s form, insuring\r\n  comfortable rest. The workmanship is skilled and thorough.

B. O. FLOWER, to the\r\n  many readers who enjoyed this great review in the early nineties when\r\n  under MR. FLOWER’S management it was the first leading magazine to\r\n  take up and aggressively carry forward the question of fundamental\r\n  Democracy, Social Justice and Civic Righteousness, _we will send\r\n  absolutely free a copy of a recent issue of The Arena to any reader\r\n  of_ WATSON’S JEFFERSONIAN MAGAZINE who sends his name and address,\r\n  together with that of some thoughtful friend who might also be\r\n  interested in seeing the Magazine.\r\n\r\n  THE ARENA FOR 1907\r\n\r\n  THE ARENA for 1907 will contain in addition to papers from the\r\n  strongest, ablest and most thoughtful fundamental thinkers who stand\r\n  for free institutions, just government and civic righteousness, a\r\n  number of highly important contributions, prepared especially for its\r\n  pages by the greatest living authors of foreign lands.\r\n\r\n  Among the early papers of these series, will be contributions by\r\n  ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE, D. C. L., L. L. D., the greatest living\r\n  evolutionary philosopher and one of the most authoritative writers in\r\n  the cause of Progressive Democratic advancement; the HON. J. HENNIKER\r\n  HEATON, M. P., the foremost living author on cheap postage, the\r\n  parcels-post, postal savings-banks and international postal and cable\r\n  service; and the HON. EDWARD TREGEAR, Secretary for Labor for New\r\n  Zealand, one of the master statesmen whose constructive work in\r\n  framing many of the important advanced, progressive and Democratic\r\n  statutes of New Zealand has placed him in a commanding position in New\r\n  Zealand among the foremost constructive, liberal statesmen of\r\n  Australasia.\r\n\r\n  The first of these important foreign papers appears in the January\r\n  ARENA from the pen of DR. ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE, and deals with the\r\n  railroad systems of the United States, and how and why the people\r\n  should take over the railroads. It will be followed by a paper from\r\n  MR. TREGEAR on “New Zealand’s Progressive Attitude.” MR. HENNIKER\r\n  HEATON’S first paper will deal with the Telegraph Cables of the world\r\n  and how they should be made of service to the millions instead of\r\n  merely the convenience of the millionaire.\r\n\r\n  Other papers from equally important and authoritative writers will be\r\n  a marked feature of the Arena for 1907, and will help to make this\r\n  Magazine the one absolutely indispensable review of opinion for all\r\n  thoughtful men and women interested in vital discussions of the larger\r\n  problems of the day from the view-point of progressive democracy and\r\n  social justice.\r\n\r\n  SUBSCRIPTION PRICE OF THE ARENA IS $2.50\r\n\r\n  SINGLE COPY, 25 CENTS.\r\n\r\n  Published by ALBERT BRANDT, Trenton, N.

Largely through its activity the good\r\n  work of our great organization has been spread into the remotest\r\n  sections, not only Georgia but throughout the south.\r\n\r\n  We have crossed the 11 cent line of cotton and in this the union has\r\n  won its great victory of the year. Throughout the contest, the\r\n  Constitution has been a tower of strength in giving us the support of\r\n  their strong right arm.\r\n\r\n  Your editorials in behalf of the Income Tax and the Inheritance Tax,\r\n  with your splendid fight for the R. F. D. Service, and the observance\r\n  of railroad schedules to enable the farmers to get their mails on\r\n  time, and to be deprived 24 hours by bad railroad connections, is\r\n  eliciting the universal approval of our people.\r\n\r\n  We glory in your good work and we are with you.\r\n\r\n  R.

Griffin, of Conway, Arkansas, and the other by Campbell\r\n  Russell, of Russell, I. T.” The character of these two gentlemen, and\r\n  the unanimity of opinion expressed by them without consultation,\r\n  indicates that the Constitution has really done a service to the\r\n  Farmers’ Union that is being appreciated.\r\n\r\n  The resolutions were practically of the same tenor expressing thanks\r\n  for the Constitution’s energy displayed and for the interest\r\n  manifested in the farmers’ organization and co-operative movements,\r\n  and for placing its power and influence back of these efforts now\r\n  being intelligently made for the solution of the farmers’ problems.\r\n\r\n  The Tri-Weekly Constitution will be delivered at your door by the R.\r\n  F.

Why buy advertising space\r\n  as you _must_ choose a salesman, why trust to intuition or snap\r\n  judgment, when you can work with figures?\r\n\r\n  Simply be sure of the answers to these questions and you’ll never buy\r\n  space in the wrong medium:\r\n\r\n  (1) What is a publication’s circulation? How is it distributed? Who\r\n  are the people that buy it? How enthusiastically do they read it? How\r\n  long do they treasure it? To what degree do they believe in and are\r\n  they influenced by it?\r\n\r\n  (2) What is the cost per page per thousand of space in this\r\n  publication?\r\n\r\n  (3) What does it cost you to reach these enthusiastic readers in other\r\n  ways?\r\n\r\n  (4) What would it cost you to reach our vast audience with one cent\r\n  post cards?\r\n\r\n  (5) How do these facts and figures (seemingly conclusive) really work\r\n  out? What results does the publication quote to make it impossible\r\n  that these figures lie?\r\n\r\n  If you do not already know the answer to all these questions\r\n  concerning WATSON’S JEFFERSONIAN MAGAZINE, that it goes into the homes\r\n  and is read by 100,000; that its readers are of the 35 cent magazine\r\n  sort in point of quality; _that they are the most enthusiastic body of\r\n  men and women reached by any publication_; that they believe in\r\n  WATSON’S JEFFERSONIAN MAGAZINE, and its editor, and know that our\r\n  advertisers are trustworthy; that every copy of WATSON’S JEFFERSONIAN\r\n  MAGAZINE is read and re-read; that the advertising rate is the lowest\r\n  quoted by any high-grade publication--about sixty cents per page per\r\n  thousand readers, then write us and let us tell you more about it.\r\n\r\n  THIS COUPON SAVES YOU 10%\r\n\r\n  ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT            SEND COPY BEFORE JANUARY 1st.\r\n  Watson’s Jeffersonian Magazine      FOR THE FEBRUARY NUMBER\r\n\r\n  ATLANTA, GA. ............... 190....\r\n\r\n  Kindly enter my order for ................. lines, six times, in the\r\n  classified columns of Watson’s Jeffersonian Magazine.

JONES\r\n\r\n  By MRS. JONES.\r\n\r\n  Why Sam Jones Appealed to the Masses With Whom He\r\n  Came in Contact.\r\n\r\n  1. He hated the sin, but he helped the sinner.\r\n\r\n  2. He thought an ounce of mirth was worth a pound of sighs in any\r\n  market place.\r\n\r\n  3. He had no mercy for the Pecksniffs of this world, and punctured\r\n  sham and hypocrisy with his keen wit.\r\n\r\n  4. He was himself a living exemplar of the truths he preached. From a\r\n  member of the “Down-and-Out Club” he raised himself to a prophet of\r\n  light.\r\n\r\n  5. He preached and proved the optimistic lesson that life is livable;\r\n  for he foresaw the day when Death, the slayer, shall himself lie\r\n  slain.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  6. He never forgot that Christianity was a religion of joy and\r\n  laughter, not one of tears and sorrow; a living help for this earth,\r\n  now and here, and not a bundle of dried and moldy dogmas.\r\n\r\n  7. He was a man of and for the people.\r\n\r\n  8. He was a humanitarian in every sense that the word implies.\r\n\r\n  9. With all his firmness and steadfastness of purpose and conviction\r\n  he was gentle, tender and kind in the truest sense.\r\n\r\n  10. Above all, he was a man.\r\n\r\n  Only Authorized Edition.\r\n\r\n  AGENTS COIN MONEY.
