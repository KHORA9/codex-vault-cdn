For more\r\nthan twenty years he has been a leading member of the bar in Lahore, the\r\ncapital city of the large province of the Punjab, and has long been\r\nprominent in public affairs both local and national.\r\n\r\nFrom almost the beginning of the National Indian Congress he has been an\r\nactive leader in that body, which is the most important political\r\norganization in the country. The last time I was in India (two and a\r\nhalf years ago) I found that he was being widely talked of for the\r\nPresidency of the Congress at its approaching yearly meeting.\r\n\r\nConspicuous in Indian educational work and a founder of the large and\r\nflourishing Anglo-Vedic College in Lahore, he has for a dozen years or\r\nmore held the position of either Vice-President or Honourary Secretary\r\nof the College, and also that of Lecturer in History.\r\n\r\nHe started _The Punjabee_, a leading paper in the province, published in\r\nEnglish, and has edited a monthly magazine and a weekly paper printed in\r\nthe vernacular, besides writing for other Indian periodicals and for\r\nreviews in London.\r\n\r\nThe Arya Samaj, an important, fast growing and influential movement of\r\nreligious reform in India, which rejects idolatry and caste and is\r\nactive in promoting education, social reforms and the elevation of\r\nwoman, counts Mr. Rai among its honoured leaders.\r\n\r\nHe has organized relief work during periods of famine in India, and has\r\nfor some years led in an extensive movement for the elevation of the\r\n“Depressed Classes,” that is, the forty millions of “outcasts” or\r\n“untouchables” whose condition is so miserable. Several years ago I\r\nattended a National Conference to promote this work, at which he\r\npresided and delivered a powerful address.\r\n\r\nMr. Lajpat Rai has made three or four extended visits to England and\r\nthree to America. In England he has spoken in many cities as a delegate\r\nfrom the National Indian Congress, for the purpose of acquainting the\r\nBritish public with the real condition of things in India, and to urge\r\nupon the British Government the granting to the Indian people of certain\r\nimportant political reforms. In America he has made a careful study of\r\nour history and institutions, our industrial and social movements, our\r\npolitical and religious life, and especially our schools and\r\nuniversities, and our educational systems and methods. He is impressed\r\nwith the leadership which the United States is attaining in the world of\r\neducation, particularly education in scientific, industrial,\r\ntechnological and agricultural directions, and he finds much here which\r\nhe desires to see introduced into his own country.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the New National Movement in India, Mr. Rai has\r\nbeen one of its most prominent leaders. He is an ardent patriot, is\r\nproud of his country, her civilization, her literature and her great\r\nplace in the world’s history, and he believes she is destined to have a\r\ngreat future, commensurate with her great past. But now she is a subject\r\nland, ruled by a foreign power, her own people having practically no\r\nvoice in the direction of their own national affairs or the shaping of\r\ntheir future destiny. This deeply grieves and galls him, as it does a\r\nlarge part of the Indian people. The Nationalist Movement, of which he\r\ngives an account in this book, is a protest against present political\r\nconditions, and a demand for larger freedom and independence. Indeed,\r\nits aim is self-rule; not necessarily severance of connection with the\r\nBritish Empire, but partnership in the Empire,--home rule inside the\r\nEmpire like that enjoyed by Canada, Australia and South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe British Government of India frowns upon this Nationalist Movement,\r\ntries to suppress it, and places its leaders under ban. This is the way\r\ndespotic governments always treat subject peoples as soon as they grow\r\nrestive in their bonds and try to loosen them or throw them off. Mr.\r\nLajpat Rai has had to pay heavily for his patriotism. In 1907 he was\r\nseized by the Government and, without trial or even being told what was\r\nhis offence, was secretly sent away to prison in Burmah, and kept there\r\nsix months. He was suspected of disloyalty and sedition, but not the\r\nslightest evidence was found against him. His only crime was that he was\r\na Nationalist, and was working in perfectly open and legal ways to\r\nsecure greater liberty for his country. After his release from prison,\r\nhe brought legal suits against two newspapers, one in India and one in\r\nLondon, that had published charges of sedition against him; and,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that the powerful influence of the Government\r\nwas on the side of the papers, he won both suits,--so clear was his\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nFor a full dozen years India has been seething with unrest, seething\r\nwith dissatisfaction over present political conditions. During the past\r\nten years there has been not a little bomb throwing and not a few signs\r\nof revolution. When the present European war broke out there were at\r\nonce increased outward expressions of loyalty; but the unrest has\r\nremained. When the war is over what will happen? That will depend, Mr.\r\nLajpat Rai believes, upon the course pursued by the British Government.\r\nIf the Government in a generous spirit meets India’s just demands, there\r\nwill be no revolution. If the Government blindly and obstinately\r\nrefuses, the worst may happen.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Rai is an ardent and uncompromising advocate of the\r\nNationalist Cause, he has always counselled procedure by evolutionary\r\nand not by revolutionary measures, by vigorous and determined agitation\r\nand not by bomb throwing. Throughout his entire career he has striven by\r\nevery means, through speech and the press, in India and in England, to\r\nmove the British Government to prevent revolution, in what he believes\r\nis the only possible way, namely, by inaugurating and carrying out\r\nhonestly a policy of justice to the Indian people.\r\n\r\nThere is in sight an Indian _Renaissance_. There is a “New India in the\r\nMaking.” Indeed the stirrings of new life in India are hardly less\r\nmarked, less profound or less revolutionary, than in Japan or China. Of\r\nthis the book gives a vivid and reliable picture,--and, what is of great\r\nimportance, a picture from the inside.\r\n\r\nWe have many books which portray Indian conditions as foreigners see\r\nthem,--particularly as they are seen by Christian missionaries and by\r\nthe British rulers of the country. At last we have a book which gives us\r\nthe life, the experiences, the wrongs, the sufferings, the hopes, the\r\naims, the motives, and, what at the present time is most important of\r\nall, the political ideals and ambitions of the Indian people themselves,\r\nportrayed by one of their own number, a leader who has been in the very\r\nheart of the struggle from the beginning, and who has felt it all in his\r\nown life and his own soul.\r\n\r\nIt is a message to every man and woman in America, and in Great Britain,\r\ntoo, who loves justice and hates oppression, and who wants to know about\r\none of the most heroic struggles for liberty now going on in the world.\r\n\r\nMy own intimate acquaintance with India for many years gives me a\r\ngreatly increased sense of the value of Mr. Rai’s book. Perhaps nothing\r\nin the volume will be found more surprising or more interesting to\r\nAmericans than the overwhelming evidence of the dissatisfaction of India\r\nwith her present political condition, and the fact that the Indian\r\npeople want home rule, want it more earnestly than they want anything\r\nelse, and that probably nothing less than this will keep them loyal to\r\nGreat Britain. This feeling, which had been growing fast for years\r\nbefore the war broke out, has since sprung into a passion. And we may be\r\nsure that the flame will not burn with less intensity when the soldiers\r\nreturn who have been risking their lives for Great Britain in Turkey and\r\nEgypt and France, and who have been learning new lessons of\r\nself-reliance, freedom and independence from their contact with the\r\ngreat world.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly possible today to take up an Indian periodical of any kind,\r\nHindu or Mohammedan, secular or religious (I myself regularly subscribe\r\nfor and read nine, two of the number making a specialty of a monthly\r\nsummary of Indian press opinion), without being brought upon some\r\nexpression of this universal desire for self-rule. The people are\r\ndisposed to be patient and considerate, and make no demands upon the\r\nGovernment that will be embarrassing so long as the war lasts. But\r\neverything indicates that when peace comes they will be in no mood to be\r\ntreated like children and put off with the usual vague and meaningless\r\npromises.\r\n\r\nSince India has borne faithfully and loyally her part in the war, one of\r\nthe distinct stipulations in the treaty of peace at the end should be\r\nthe granting to her of home rule. This is as much her right as is\r\nautonomy the right of Belgium or Poland. This right is recognized by not\r\na few Englishmen; it should be recognized by the whole nation, and put\r\ninto effect generously, freely, without waiting for struggle and\r\nbloodshed. The advantage to Great Britain would be incalculable. It\r\nwould remove from her as a nation her most threatening danger, and it\r\nwould give to her Empire a solidity and permanent strength such as it\r\ncannot otherwise secure.\r\n\r\nWhile India wants freedom to shape her own affairs, her wisest minds do\r\nnot desire separation from England. They recognize many strong ties\r\nbetween the two countries which they would not see broken. While they\r\nare determined not much longer to lie prostrate beneath England’s feet,\r\nthey would gladly stand by her side, arm in arm with her, firmly united\r\nfor great ends of mutual welfare and mutual strength. An Anglo-Indian\r\nEmpire is one of the splendid possibilities of the future, binding\r\nBritain and her colonies and her great Asiatic possession together into\r\na powerful world-spanning federation of free peoples. Something like\r\nthis is the dream of India’s greatest leaders, as it is also the dream\r\nof not a few of Britain’s most far-seeing minds.\r\n\r\nWhen this world-revolutionizing war is over, Great Britain must reshape\r\nafter a larger and more adequate pattern her whole scheme of Imperial\r\nGovernment. She must become a Federated Empire. There must be\r\nself-government at home, not only for Ireland but also for Scotland,\r\nWales and England. And there must be self-government abroad, not only\r\nfor Canada, Australasia and South Africa, but, as not less imperative\r\nand not less wise, for India also, to be followed in time, as conditions\r\ncan be made favourable, by self-rule more or less complete for all of\r\nBritain’s more important dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe danger is that Britain may forget India or thrust her aside, as in\r\nthe past, to the position of a mere dependency. If she does this she\r\nwill plant a cancer in the heart of her Empire, she will create a\r\nvolcano under her throne. It will take courage and large statesmanship\r\nto give India home rule, as it took large statesmanship and courage to\r\ngive home rule to South Africa. But the splendid venture must be made.\r\nAnd, made in the right spirit, it will succeed as perfectly as it did in\r\nSouth Africa.\r\n\r\nHas Great Britain statesmen sufficiently far-sighted, with adequate\r\ngenius and courage, to do to India the splendid justice of giving her\r\nthe home rule which is her right, and then to create a world-circling\r\nfederation of free peoples with India a partner in it,--a real\r\nAnglo-Indian Empire? It would be the most brilliant, constructive and\r\nnoble work of statesmanship known to the modern world.\r\n\r\nNow that Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans as\r\nwell as Englishmen, Scotchmen, Welshmen and Irishmen have fought side by\r\nside with the soldiers of India, shedding their blood in a common cause,\r\nwhy should they not all gladly welcome those heroic and loyal men of the\r\nEast to a place by their side in the Empire which they have helped to\r\nsave?\r\n\r\nNeed England shrink from the risk? This is her path of least risk. Under\r\npresent conditions India is her peril. The one thing that will transform\r\nIndia from a source of ever-increasing danger to a bulwark of strength,\r\nis to trust her as South Africa has been trusted. She is certainly as\r\nworthy of trust as South Africa was. Thus to trust her, and to lift her\r\nup to a responsible place in the Empire, will appeal to India’s pride as\r\nit has never been appealed to, will create in her an enthusiasm of\r\nloyalty equal to anything seen in any of the self-ruling colonies, will\r\nbind her to Great Britain with bands of steel.\r\n\r\nIs it said that India is incapable of ruling herself? That was said of\r\nSouth Africa; that was said of Canada; that was said of the American\r\nColonies when they broke off from Great Britain and set up a Government\r\nof their own; that is what England has long been saying of Ireland. That\r\nis what every nation that loves power always says of every section of\r\nits people that wants more liberty.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the safest Government in the world for every people of any\r\nintellectual and moral development at all (and India is advanced, both\r\nintellectually and morally) is self-government. No rule so completely\r\ndestroys the fibre of a nation as rule by a foreign power. India can\r\nrule herself far better than any foreign nation can rule her.\r\n\r\nIf India is incapable of self-government today, what an indictment is\r\nthat against England! She was not thus incapable before England came.\r\nHas one hundred and fifty years of British tutelage produced such\r\ndeterioration? India was possessed of a high civilization and of\r\ndeveloped Governments long before England or any part of Central,\r\nWestern or Northern Europe had emerged from barbarism. For three\r\nthousand years before England’s arrival in the Orient, Indian Kingdoms\r\nand Empires had held leading places in Asia, and that means in the\r\nworld. Some of the ablest rulers, statesmen, generals and financiers\r\nknown to history, as well as many of the greatest thinkers and writers\r\nof mankind, have been of India’s production. How is it, then, that she\r\nsuddenly becomes imbecile and unable to stand on her own feet or conduct\r\nher own affairs as soon as England appears on the scene?\r\n\r\nTo be sure, at the time when England came, India was in a peculiarly\r\ndisorganized and unsettled state; for it should be remembered that the\r\nMogul Empire was just breaking up and new political adjustments were\r\neverywhere just being made,--a fact which accounts for England’s being\r\nable to gain political power in India at all. But everything indicates\r\nthat if India had not been interfered with by European nations, she\r\nwould soon have been under competent Governments of her own again.\r\n\r\nA further answer to the assertion that India cannot govern\r\nherself--surely one that should be conclusive--is the fact that, in\r\nparts, she is governing herself now, and governing herself well. It is\r\nnotorious that the very best Government in India to-day is not that\r\ncarried on by the British, but that of several of the Native States,\r\nnotably Baroda and Mysore. In these States, particularly Baroda, the\r\npeople are more free, more prosperous, more contented, and are making\r\nmore progress, than in any other part of India. Note the superiority of\r\nboth these States in the important matter of popular education. Mysore\r\nis spending on education more than three times as much per capita as is\r\nBritish India, while Baroda has made her education free and compulsory.\r\nBoth of these States, but especially Baroda, which has thus placed\r\nherself in line with the leading nations of Europe and America by making\r\nprovisions for the education of all her children, may well be contrasted\r\nwith British India, which provides education, even of the poorest kind,\r\nfor only one boy in ten and one girl in one hundred and forty-four.\r\n\r\nThe only ground at all that exists for the claim that the Indian people\r\nare not able to govern themselves lies in the fact that the British\r\nGovernment during all its history in the land has deprived them, and\r\nstill continues to deprive them, against their constant protest, of\r\npractical experience in Government management. They had such experience\r\nbefore the British came, but since that time they have been robbed of it\r\nto their great injury. Of course, under present conditions, if the\r\nBritish should leave India in a day, with no body of men trained to take\r\ntheir places, for a time there would be confusion, just as there would\r\nbe confusion in England if everybody there accustomed to Government\r\nmanagement should leave that country in a day.\r\n\r\nBut the Indian people do not ask England to leave India in a day, or to\r\nleave at all; what they ask is for England to associate with herself the\r\ncompetent men of India in the government of their own country, and thus\r\ngive them the experience in self-rule which is their right and of which\r\nthey never ought to have been deprived. With such opportunities for\r\npractical experience extended to them for twenty years, or even for ten\r\nyears, they would be ready for the full responsibilities of home rule.\r\n\r\nAmong the tens of thousands of India’s educated men, and men of natural\r\ncapacity for leadership, there is no lack of material to fill, and fill\r\nwell as soon as they are given experience, every kind of official\r\nposition. Many of the highest judgeships are now filled with great\r\nefficiency by Indians. In no department of the Government where Indians\r\nhave been adequately tried have they been found wanting.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, not one single fact can be cited to show that India cannot\r\ngovern herself well if given a chance. It would not be difficult to form\r\nan Indian Parliament today, composed of men as able and of as high\r\ncharacter as those that constitute the fine Parliament of Japan. India\r\nhas public men who, if they lived in England and belonged to the English\r\nrace, would unhesitatingly be adjudged not only of Parliamentary but of\r\nCabinet rank. For twenty years before his recent lamented death Mr.\r\nGokhale was confessedly the equal in intellectual ability and in moral\r\nworth of any Englishman in India, not excepting the three Viceroys under\r\nwhom he served. It is no exaggeration to declare that Mr. Justice Renade\r\nhad qualifications fully fitting him for the position of Viceroy, or if\r\nhe had lived in England, fitting him for the position of Premier.\r\n\r\nThis is only another way of saying that among the leaders of the various\r\nStates and Provinces of India there is abundant material to form\r\nNational and Provincial Governments little, if at all, inferior in\r\nability and in moral character to the Governments of the Western world.\r\n\r\nJ.

The fact can only be\r\nexplained by the broad-minded sympathy of the American public for the\r\n“under dog.” I had a story to tell which the American public decided was\r\nworthy of being heard. So they heard it and now that they have heard it\r\nthey want more of it.\r\n\r\nIn launching a second edition I take the opportunity of thanking the\r\nAmerican press for their most generous and kindly appreciation of my\r\nlittle work. To the London Liberal press represented by the _Nation_ and\r\nthe _New Statesman_ also I pay my acknowledgments. Their kindly\r\nreception shows the genuineness of their liberalism which, by the by, is\r\nthe most valuable asset of English public life. Compare with this the\r\ntreatment that has been accorded to me and my book by the British Indian\r\nGovernment. The first thing they did to injure me was to get the High\r\nCourt at Lahore to cancel my license as a lawyer in the Punjab, India,\r\non the ground of my being the author of a pamphlet called “Some\r\nReflections on the Political Situation in India,” to which they\r\nobjected and which they barred from entry into British India. This order\r\nis of course illegal; but the High Court of the Punjab has not a high\r\nreputation for its legal attainments and is always a willing instrument\r\nof the Executive. Then came the order barring this book. This by itself\r\nought to be sufficient to show off the amount of political freedom we\r\nenjoy in India, but the year 1916 has been made memorable in the\r\npolitical history of India by other events of even a more significant\r\ncharacter. Throughout the year, the Government in India continued to\r\nprosecute an English lady of world-wide fame, for the simple reason that\r\nthat lady had the audacity of identifying herself with the “Home Rule of\r\nIndia” movement. Mrs. Annie Besant is an English woman of international\r\nfame. She is one of the most accomplished and eloquent platform speakers\r\nwhich the English speaking nations possess. She is a distinguished\r\nauthor and the revered head of the Theosophical Society which has\r\nramifications all over the world. In addition to her religious and\r\nsocial and literary activities Mrs. Annie Besant has for some years been\r\ntaking an active interest in the Indian Nationalist movement. She owns\r\nand edits two papers, one a daily and the other a weekly, both written\r\nin English and published at Madras, India, in the interests of Indian\r\nNationalism. She is the founder and President of an Indian Home Rule\r\nLeague. She is an outspoken critic of the Russian methods of repression,\r\nsuppression and confiscation that are in vogue in the Indian\r\nAdministration. During Lord Hardinge’s viceroyalty her criticism was\r\ntolerated, as the Head of the Government was known to be friendly to\r\nher. As soon, however, as Lord Hardinge turned his back on India, Mrs.\r\nBesant’s good luck abandoned her and down came the hand of the Madras\r\nGovernment. The first order against her demanded security for her daily\r\npaper, _New India_. This security was duly furnished and has since been\r\nconfiscated and a new security of a much larger sum has been demanded.\r\nMrs. Besant has complied with these orders also, though under protest\r\nand is contesting them in the courts. One court has rejected her appeal,\r\nholding that though the order of the Government was illegal, the\r\nstatutes gave them no power to give relief. She is now appealing to the\r\nJudicial Committee of the Privy Council, in London, and the matter rests\r\nthere. Two other Provincial Governments, those of Bombay and the Central\r\nProvinces, took action to restrict her liberty of movement, by\r\nprohibiting her entry into their respective jurisdictions, under the\r\nDefence of India Act. All this has made a sensation and Mrs. Annie\r\nBesant is one of the most popular persons in India at the present\r\nmoment. She is considered a heroine and the Nationalist party is backing\r\nher up fully. Her financial losses have been made up to her and her\r\npapers are flourishing. Her Home Rule League is spreading.\r\n\r\nMrs. Annie Besant has not, however, been the only recipient of\r\nGovernment attention during the course of the year. The Nationalist\r\nleader, Bal Ganga Dhar Tilak, has been persecuted in various ways. A\r\nMagistrate was found to adjudge some of his speeches in favour of Home\r\nRule as seditious and on the basis of that adjudication, Mr. Tilak was\r\nordered to deposit security of over $13,000 for good behaviour for a\r\nyear, the object being to gag him. On Mr. Tilak appealing to the High\r\nCourt the Judges quashed the order, holding that the speeches, read as a\r\nwhole, did not violate the law. He is, however, still being followed and\r\npersecuted otherwise.\r\n\r\n_Press Act._ The following resolution passed by the Council of the\r\nBombay Presidency Association in connection with the proceedings taken\r\nby the Government against Mrs. Besant’s _New India_ speaks for itself:\r\n\r\n     “Having regard to the arbitrary character of the provisions of the\r\n     Press Act of 1910 and the manner in which it has been enforced in\r\n     the case of several newspapers, and recently in the case of _New\r\n     India_, thereby causing public dissatisfaction and discontent, this\r\n     Council is of opinion that a representation should be submitted to\r\n     the Government by the Association pointing out the oppressive\r\n     character of the Act and its administration and asking for its\r\n     appeal. The Council, therefore, resolves, that a committee\r\n     consisting of Sir Narayan Chandavarkar, Messrs. B. G. Horniman, D.\r\n     N. Bahadurji, A. M. Jinnah and the Honorary Secretaries be\r\n     appointed to draft a memorial for the purpose and submit it to the\r\n     Council within a fortnight.”\r\n\r\n_Political Crime in Bengal._ In Bengal there has been no falling off in\r\nthe activities of the Revolutionary party in spite of the fact that the\r\npowers taken by the Government under the Defence of India Act have been\r\nruthlessly exercised. The following extracts taken from a press comment\r\non the Resolution of the Government of Bengal relating to the working of\r\nthe Police Department in 1915 may be of some interest in this\r\nconnection:\r\n\r\n     “The Resolution of the Bengal Government on the Report of the\r\n     Police administration in the Presidency for 1915 says that the\r\n     criminal record of the year was a black one. Serious crime of all\r\n     kinds except rioting showed considerable increase, which was most\r\n     marked in the case of offences against property. True cases of\r\n     dacoity increased from 289 in 1914 to 643 in 1915, burglary cases\r\n     from 30,294 to 39,812 and theft cases from 17,730 to 31,552. The\r\n     increase in theft and burglary may be ascribed mainly to the\r\n     unfavourable economic conditions caused by partial crop failures in\r\n     many districts of the province and by a heavy fall in the price of\r\n     jute. In the case of dacoity, however, there appears to be good\r\n     reason for attributing the increase almost entirely to the state of\r\n     unrest caused by the war.\r\n\r\n     “Referring to revolutionary crime in Bengal the resolution says:\r\n     The outbreak of revolutionary crime in the early part of the year\r\n     was followed by a lull after the introduction of the Defence of\r\n     India Act in April. The latter part of the year was, however,\r\n     marked by renewed activity on the part of the revolutionary party\r\n     and the total number of cases believed to be connected with the\r\n     movement was 36 as compared with 12 in the previous year. These\r\n     cases included 34 dacoities, 2 attempted dacoities, 9 murders and\r\n     one attempted bomb outrage.\r\n\r\n     “With regard to the circulation of seditious literature, the report\r\n     of the Inspector General of Police says: Increased activity in the\r\n     circulation of seditious leaflets came to notice about June and\r\n     continued throughout the year. Under the existing law mere\r\n     possession of seditious matter is not an offence and consequently\r\n     there are no means of checking the serious evil at the fountain\r\n     head. It is only after the seditious and inflammatory matter has\r\n     been circulated and mischief done that the law can be put in\r\n     motion. There is convincing evidence that the revolutionary party\r\n     in Bengal depend largely upon seditious literature to recruit their\r\n     ranks and several youths have confessed that they were drawn into\r\n     the movement through reading leaflets issued by the revolutionists.\r\n     Penalising the possession of seditious matter may not be a complete\r\n     cure for the evil, but it will materially assist to check it.”\r\n\r\nAs recently as December 11, 1916, the Governor laid renewed emphasis\r\nupon the continued existence of serious political crime in Bengal and of\r\ntheir failure to check or extirpate it.\r\n\r\nSince then a new ordinance has been promulgated making the mere\r\npossession of seditious literature penal.\r\n\r\n_In the Punjab_ the Government prosecuted a third batch of persons on\r\ncharges of political conspiracy, six of whom have since been sentenced\r\nto death and the others to varying terms of imprisonment and\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\n_The united demand for autonomy._ The most significant political event\r\nof the year, however, is the presentation to the Viceroy of a joint\r\nmemorandum of post-war reforms signed by nineteen out of twenty-two\r\nelected members of the Viceroy’s Legislative Council. In the opinion of\r\nthe signatories this is the minimum which will satisfy Indian public\r\nopinion _for the present_. The demands are not far-reaching enough on\r\nthe way to autonomy but the document is remarkable as a symbol of unity\r\nbetween the different religious communities and castes of the Indian\r\npopulation, on the so-called lack of which the British Imperialist so\r\nmuch relies, in justification of denying self-government to India.\r\nComing from men of varying shades of political opinion, pledged by their\r\noath of allegiance to loyalty to the British Government and by their\r\nconnection with the latter, the document is the most conclusive and\r\nscathing condemnation of the existing system of Government in India. We\r\nmake no apology for giving the document in full.\r\n\r\n     MEMORANDUM submitted to H. E., the Viceroy, by the undersigned\r\n     elected Additional Members of the Imperial Legislative Council with\r\n     regard to Post-War reforms.\r\n\r\n     There is no doubt that the termination of the war will see a great\r\n     advance in the ideals of government all over the civilised world\r\n     and especially in the British Empire, which entered into the\r\n     struggle in defence of the liberties of weak and small\r\n     nationalities and is pouring forth its richest blood and treasure\r\n     in upholding the cause of justice and humanity in the international\r\n     relations of the world. India has borne her part in this struggle\r\n     and cannot remain unaffected by the new spirit of change for a\r\n     better state of things. Expectations have been raised in this\r\n     country and hopes held out that, after the war, the problems of\r\n     Indian Administration will be looked at from a new angle of vision.\r\n     The people of India have good reasons to be grateful to England for\r\n     the great progress in her material resources and the widening of\r\n     her intellectual and political outlook under British rule, and for\r\n     the steady, if slow, advance in her national life commencing with\r\n     the Charter Act of India of 1833. Up to 1909, the Government of\r\n     India was conducted by a bureaucracy almost entirely non-Indian in\r\n     its composition and not responsible to the people of India. The\r\n     reforms of 1909 for the first time introduced an Indian element in\r\n     the direction of affairs in the administration of India. This\r\n     element was of a very limited character. The Indian people accepted\r\n     it as an indication on the part of the Government of a desire to\r\n     admit the Indians into the inner counsels of the Indian Empire. So\r\n     far as the Legislative Councils are concerned, the number of\r\n     non-official members was merely enlarged with increased facilities\r\n     for debate and interpellation. The Supreme Legislative Council\r\n     retained an absolute official majority, and in the Provincial\r\n     Legislative Councils, where a non-official majority was allowed,\r\n     such majority included nominated members and the European\r\n     representatives. In measures largely affecting the people, whether\r\n     of legislation or taxation, by which Europeans were not directly\r\n     affected, the European members would naturally support the\r\n     Government, and the nominated members, being nominees of\r\n     Government, would be inclined to take the same side. Past\r\n     experience has shown that this has actually happened on various\r\n     occasions. The non-official majorities, therefore, in the\r\n     Provincial Councils have proved largely illusory and give no real\r\n     power to the representatives of the people. The Legislative\r\n     Councils, whether Supreme or Provincial, are at present nothing but\r\n     advisory bodies without any power of effective control over the\r\n     Government, Imperial or Provincial. The people or their\r\n     representatives are practically as little associated with the real\r\n     government of the country as they were before the reforms, except\r\n     for the introduction of the Indian element in the Executive\r\n     Councils, where again the nomination rests entirely with the\r\n     Government, the people having no voice in the selection of the\r\n     Indian members.\r\n\r\n     The object which the Government had in view in introducing the\r\n     reforms of 1909 was, as expressed by the Prime Minister in his\r\n     speech in the House of Commons on the second reading of the Indian\r\n     Councils Bill (1st April, 1909), that “it was most desirable in the\r\n     circumstances to give to the people of India the feeling that these\r\n     Legislative Councils are not mere automatons the wires of which are\r\n     pulled by the official hierarchy.” This object, it is submitted,\r\n     has not been attained. Apart from this question of the Constitution\r\n     of the Legislative and Executive Councils, the people labour under\r\n     certain grave disabilities, which not only prevent the utilisation,\r\n     but also lead to the wastage, of what is best in them, and are\r\n     positively derogatory to their sense of national self-respect. The\r\n     Arms Act which excludes from its operation Europeans and\r\n     Anglo-Indians and applies only to the pure natives of the country,\r\n     the disqualification of Indians for forming or joining Volunteer\r\n     corps, and their exclusion from the commissioned ranks of the Army,\r\n     are disabilities which are looked upon with an irritating sense of\r\n     racial differentiation. It would be bad enough if these were mere\r\n     disabilities. Restrictions and prohibitions regarding the\r\n     possession and use of arms have tended to emasculate the civil\r\n     populations in India and expose them to serious danger. The\r\n     position of Indians in India is practically this, that they have no\r\n     real part or share in the direction of the government of the\r\n     country, and are placed under very great and galling disabilities\r\n     from which the other members of the British Empire are exempt and\r\n     which have reduced them to a state of utter helplessness. The\r\n     existence, moreover, of the system of indentured emigration gives\r\n     to the British Colonies and the outside world the impression that\r\n     Indians, as a whole, are no better than indentured coolies, who are\r\n     looked upon as very little, if at all, above the slave. The present\r\n     state of things makes the Indians feel that, though theoretically\r\n     they are equal subjects of the King, they hold a very inferior\r\n     position in the British Empire. Other Asiatic races also hold the\r\n     same, if not a worse, view about India and her status in the\r\n     Empire. Humiliating as this position of inferiority is to the\r\n     Indian mind, it is almost unbearable to the youth of India whose\r\n     outlook is broadened by education and travel in foreign parts where\r\n     they come in contact with other free races.\r\n\r\n     In the face of these grievances and disabilities, what has\r\n     sustained the people is the hope and faith inspired by promises and\r\n     assurances of fair and equal treatment which have been held out\r\n     from time to time by our Sovereigns and British statesmen of high\r\n     standing. In the crisis we are now going through, the Indian people\r\n     have sunk domestic differences between themselves and the\r\n     Government and have faithfully and loyally stood by the Empire. The\r\n     Indian soldiers were eager to go to the battlefields of Europe, not\r\n     as mercenary troops but as free citizens of the British Empire\r\n     which required their services, and her civilian population was\r\n     animated by one desire, namely, to stand by England in the hour of\r\n     her need. Peace and tranquillity reigned throughout India when she\r\n     was practically denuded of British and Indian troops. The Prime\r\n     Minister of England, while voicing the sentiments of the English\r\n     people in regard to India’s part in this great war, spoke of\r\n     Indians as “the joint and equal custodians of one common interest\r\n     and future.” India does not claim any reward for her loyalty, but\r\n     she has a right to expect that the want of confidence on the part\r\n     of the Government, to which she not unnaturally ascribes her\r\n     present state, should now be a thing of the past and that she\r\n     should no longer occupy a position of subordination but one of\r\n     comradeship. This would assure the Indian people that England is\r\n     ready and willing to help them to attain self-government under the\r\n     ægis of the British Crown, and thus discharge the noble mission\r\n     which she has undertaken and to which she has so often given\r\n     voluntary expression through her rulers and statesmen. What is\r\n     wanted is not merely good government or efficient administration,\r\n     but government that is acceptable to the people because it is\r\n     responsible to them. This is what India understands would\r\n     constitute the changed angle of vision.\r\n\r\n     If, after the termination of the war, the position of India\r\n     practically remains what it was before, and there is no material\r\n     change in it, it will undoubtedly cause bitter disappointment and\r\n     great discontent in the country, and the beneficent effects of\r\n     participation in common danger, overcome by common effort will soon\r\n     disappear, leaving no record behind save the painful memory of\r\n     unrealised expectations. We feel sure that the Government is also\r\n     alive to the situation and is contemplating measures of reform in\r\n     the administration of the country. We feel that we should avail\r\n     ourselves of this opportunity to respectfully offer to Government\r\n     our humble suggestions as to the lines on which reforms should\r\n     proceed. They must, in our opinion, go to the root of the matter.\r\n     They must give to the people real and effective participation in\r\n     the government of the country, and also remove those irritating\r\n     disabilities as regards the possession of arms and a military\r\n     career, which indicate want of confidence in the people and place\r\n     them in a position of inferiority and helplessness. With this view,\r\n     we would take the liberty to suggest the following measures for\r\n     consideration and adoption:\r\n\r\n     1. In all the Executive Councils, Provincial and Imperial, half the\r\n     number of members should be Indians; the European element in the\r\n     Executive Councils should, as far as possible, be nominated from\r\n     the ranks of men trained and educated in the public life of\r\n     England, so that India may have the benefit of a wider outlook and\r\n     larger experience of the outside world. It is not absolutely\r\n     essential that the members of the Executive Councils, Indians or\r\n     Europeans, should have experience of actual administration, for, as\r\n     in the case of Ministers in England, the assistance of the\r\n     permanent officials of the departments is always available to them.\r\n     As regards Indians, we venture to say that a sufficient number of\r\n     qualified Indians, who can worthily fill the office of members of\r\n     the Executive Council and hold portfolios, is always available. Our\r\n     short experience in this direction has shown how Indians like Sir\r\n     S. P. Sinha, Sir Syed Ali Imam, the late Mr. Krishnaswami Iyer, Sir\r\n     Shams-ul-Huda and Sir Sankaran Nair have maintained a high level of\r\n     administrative ability in the discharge of their duties. Moreover,\r\n     it is well known that the Native States, where Indians have\r\n     opportunities, have produced renowned administrators like Sir Salar\r\n     Jang, Sir T. Madhava Rao, Sir Sheshadri Ayer, Dewan Bahadur\r\n     Raghunath Rao, not to mention the present administrators in the\r\n     various Native States of India. The statutory obligation, now\r\n     existing, that three of the members of the Supreme Executive\r\n     Council shall be selected from the public services in India and\r\n     similar provisions with regard to Provincial Councils should be\r\n     removed. The elected representatives of the people should have a\r\n     voice in the selection of the Indian members of the Executive\r\n     Councils and for that purpose a principle of election should be\r\n     adopted.\r\n\r\n     2. All the Legislative Councils in India should have a substantial\r\n     majority of elected representatives. These representatives, we feel\r\n     sure, will watch and safeguard the interests of the masses and the\r\n     agricultural population, with whom they are in closer touch than\r\n     any European officer, however sympathetic, can possibly be. The\r\n     proceedings of the various Legislative Councils and the Indian\r\n     National Congress and the Moslem League bear ample testimony to the\r\n     solicitude of the educated Indians for the welfare of the masses\r\n     and their acquaintance with their wants and wishes. The franchise\r\n     should be broadened and extended directly to the people,\r\n     Mohammedans or Hindus, wherever they are in a minority, being given\r\n     proper and adequate representation, having regard to their\r\n     numerical strength and position.\r\n\r\n     3. The total number of the members of the Supreme Council should be\r\n     not less than 150, and of the Provincial Councils not less than 100\r\n     for the major provinces, and not less than 60 to 75 for the minor\r\n     provinces.\r\n\r\n     4. The Budget should be passed in the shape of money bills, fiscal\r\n     autonomy being conceded to India.\r\n\r\n     5. The Imperial Legislative Council should have power to legislate\r\n     on, and discuss and pass resolutions relating to, all matters of\r\n     Indian administration, and the Provincial Councils should have\r\n     similar powers with regard to Provincial administrations, save and\r\n     except that the direction of military affairs, of foreign\r\n     relations, declarations of war, the making of peace, and the\r\n     entering into treaties, other than commercial, should be vested in\r\n     the Government of India. As a safeguard, the\r\n     Governor-General-in-Council or the Governor-in-Council, as the case\r\n     may be, should have the right of veto, which, however, should be\r\n     exercised subject to certain conditions and limitations.\r\n\r\n     6. The Council of the Secretary of State should be abolished. The\r\n     Secretary of State should, as far as possible, hold in relation to\r\n     the Government of India a position similar to that which the\r\n     Secretary of State for the Colonies holds in relation to the\r\n     Colonies. The Secretary of State should be assisted by two\r\n     permanent Under-Secretaries, one of whom should be an Indian. The\r\n     salaries of the Secretary and the Under-Secretaries should be\r\n     placed on the British estimates.\r\n\r\n     7. In any scheme of Imperial Federation, India should be given\r\n     through her chosen representatives a place similar to that of the\r\n     self-governing dominions.\r\n\r\n     8. The Provincial Governments should be made autonomous, as stated\r\n     in the Government of India’s despatch dated 25th August, 1911.\r\n\r\n     9. The United Provinces, as well as the other major provinces\r\n     should have a Governor brought from the United Kingdom and should\r\n     have an Executive Council.\r\n\r\n     10. A full measure of local self-government should be immediately\r\n     granted.\r\n\r\n     11. The right to carry arms should be granted to Indians on the\r\n     same conditions as to Europeans.\r\n\r\n     12. Indians should be allowed to enlist as volunteers and units of\r\n     a territorial army established in India.\r\n\r\n     13. Commissions in the Army should be given to Indian youths under\r\n     conditions similar to those applicable to Europeans.\r\n\r\n  MANINDRA CHANDRA NANDY OF KASIMBAZAR.\r\n  D.E.

They proceed from a body of professed loyalists.\r\nThey have received wide support from representative organisations of\r\nHindus and Mahommedans as well as from representative men of all\r\nclasses, castes and denominations.\r\n\r\n_India in England._ In England the exigencies of the war have left no\r\ntime for the British Parliament to devote to the meagre discussions of\r\nIndian affairs that followed the presentation of East India accounts\r\nonce a year. The requirements of the law in this respect have been\r\nconveniently ignored. In the press too, while every expression of\r\nloyalty is lauded to the skies and even cabled to America, the demands\r\nfor rights and reforms are silently ignored or hooted with contempt. The\r\nreactionary Lord Sydenham has, however, sounded a note of alarm urging\r\nthe “immediate and final” rejection of the demands made by the nineteen\r\nmembers of the Viceroy’s Legislative Council. The London _Nation_ and\r\nthe _New Statesman_ have come out with sympathetic articles.\r\n\r\n_India in America._ Here in the United States of America the attention\r\npaid to Indian affairs by the American press, has elicited long\r\nstatements by British statesmen in connection with their rule in India.\r\nThe Secretary of State for India, the Under Secretary of State for\r\nIndia, the Viceroy, the Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab, the Finance\r\nMinister have all granted interviews to American correspondents,\r\nassuring the latter of the marvellous progress India is making under\r\nBritish rule, of the prosperity and loyalty of India and of the extreme\r\nunimportance of the Nationalist party. Judged from these interviews\r\nIndia must be a very paradise on earth--a garden of Eden. Most of the\r\nstatements are vague and misleading, containing half truths and\r\nsuppressing important facts. I will pick up one statement for purposes\r\nof illustration. The Finance Minister of India is reported to have\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     “So far from the people of India groaning under an enormous burden\r\n     of taxation India is one of the most lightly taxed countries on the\r\n     face of the earth.... The total Revenue, Imperial and Provincial,\r\n     for the current year amounted to £86,500,000 and this sum\r\n     distributed among the 244,000,000 people of British India gave a\r\n     resultant contribution per capita of only seven shillings.”\r\n\r\nNow at best this is only a half truth. The Finance Minister should have\r\nadded that the total income of India is about £600,000,000 a year,\r\nbringing the average per capita to £2 a year. Seven shillings out of £2\r\na year is perhaps the heaviest tax paid by any country on the face of\r\nthe earth. Equally misleading are other statements about land tax, etc.,\r\nwhich I am noticing in my new book dealing with Economic Effects of\r\nBritish Rule in India which is going to the press soon.\r\n\r\nThe writer is also establishing a kind of Bureau in New York, where all\r\nkinds of information, political, economic, legal, commercial, etc.,\r\nrelating to India will be supplied to the American public.\r\n\r\nLAJPAT RAI.\r\n\r\nNew York,\r\n\r\n19th January, 1917.\r\n\r\nP. S. Since the above was written the newspapers have reported that the\r\nBritish Government have decided to raise a war loan of $500,000,000 in\r\nIndia as a “free gift” to Great Britain. Free gift, indeed! Where the\r\ndonor and the donee are the same--a free gift by a people vast numbers\r\nof whom do not get two meals a day and have an average income of ten\r\ndollars a year. Imperialism, wonderful are thy feats!!!\r\n\r\n     NOTE: The _Manchester Guardian_, March 13, 1917, comments as\r\n     follows upon the war loan mentioned in the above P. S., the italics\r\n     being mine:\r\n\r\n     “Why was this question of a financial contribution from India\r\n     raised now? _For our own part we have the gravest doubt as to the\r\n     wisdom or justice of taking any financial contribution from India._\r\n     We believe that this is not the best way for India and for the\r\n     Empire, in which India can serve the common cause, and _that the\r\n     loss it represents to an extremely poor population like that of\r\n     India is very much greater than the gain it represents to England_.\r\n     If we really are seriously concerned that India ‘should develop in\r\n     every way the vast potentialities of her indigenous products’ it\r\n     would be better to spend 100 millions [£] on developing her\r\n     resources than to take that money from India and in exchange give\r\n     Bombay a tariff.”\r\n\r\nLAJPAT RAI.\r\n\r\n18th March, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nDuring my travels in the world, the one point that has struck me most\r\nforcibly and most painfully, is the lack of true knowledge about the\r\naffairs of India among the “civilised” nations of the globe. Even the\r\nbest educated among them know very little about India and what little\r\nthey know is not always right. The sources from which the ordinary\r\nstay-at-home Westerner derives his knowledge about India are the\r\nfollowing: (a) missionaries who have been to India, (b) English writers\r\nof the class of Rudyard Kipling and Sir Valentine Chirol, (c) British\r\nofficials, (d) serious students of Indian history or Indian literature\r\nlike the late Professor Max Müller, the late Miss Noble, and the late\r\nProfessor Goldstucker.\r\n\r\nNow unfortunately for India most of these people, except those coming\r\nunder the last heading, have generally an axe to grind and can not be\r\naccepted as disinterested, well-informed, impartial authorities. Their\r\nreading of Indian history is often perverted and their observations of\r\nIndian life partial and distorted. They go to India with definite aims,\r\nlook at persons and things from their own particular angle, and pose as\r\nauthorities on matters far beyond the scope of their observations and\r\nstudies. With rare exceptions most of the Westerners who go to India go\r\nwith the presumption that the people of India belong to an inferior\r\nlevel of society; that they are heathens, worshippers of stocks and\r\nstones; that they are hopelessly divided into castes and classes; that\r\nthese castes and classes are always at each other’s throats; that they\r\nhave never had a settled or civilised form of government; that the\r\nBritish have for the first time in their history given them a settled\r\ngovernment; and that India would go to pieces if British government were\r\nto withdraw.\r\n\r\nWriters about India may again be broadly subdivided into two classes:\r\n(a) those of British origin, (b) those of non-British origin. Those of\r\nBritish origin are in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred tainted with\r\nthe imperial bias. They can only look at things from the imperial or\r\nBritish point of view. Even the best and the most fair-minded of them do\r\nnot altogether succeed in freeing themselves from this bias. The bias\r\nacts even against their will. The second class of writers are affected\r\nby the racial and the colour bias. Moreover, nine out of ten amongst\r\nthem are made to look at things from the British point of view. As soon\r\nas they land at an Indian port, they are taken in hand by the British\r\nresidents, officials and non-officials, and practically the whole of\r\ntheir trip is arranged for them by the latter. They only see things\r\nwhich the ruling community want them to see and they only hear and know\r\nwhat these allow them to hear or know. The few who resolutely refuse to\r\nbe thus “programmed” do sometimes see things in their true light, as\r\nthe late Mr. Keir Hardie, M.P., and Mr. H. W. Nevinson did.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I think the following remarks of the latest American\r\nwriter on India, Professor Pratt of Williams College, Massachusetts, in\r\nhis book on “India and Its Faiths” are very pertinent. Professor Pratt\r\nbegins by warning the reader against “the point of view of the native”\r\nhimself, as well as against “those European writers who seek to give an\r\nultra ‘sympathetic’ picture of India.” But his observations about the\r\nother two of the four sources of information mentioned by him are\r\nextremely interesting. He says:\r\n\r\n“Much greater is the danger that we, with our Western ideals and customs\r\nso different from those of India, should go to the other extreme and\r\ntake one of the two remaining points of view that I referred to above.\r\nOne of these is that which characterises a certain type (now happily\r\ndecreasing) of earnest but narrow-minded missionary.” The fourth source\r\nof information, which, according to Professor Pratt, “one should regard\r\nwith distrust,” comprises “the superficial tourist or the non-missionary\r\nEuropean resident in India.” In his opinion this source is particularly\r\ndangerous, for “it is so natural to suppose that one of our own race who\r\nhas travelled in India (and especially one who has lived there\r\n‘twenty-two years’) will be in a position to know all about it.... The\r\ntourist’s ignorance is not surprising, but it is not easy to understand\r\nthe ignorance of the average European resident in India.” Professor\r\nPratt’s remarks about the “average European resident,” who has been\r\n“twenty-two years” in India, are prefaced by an eulogistic tribute to\r\nthe British administration of justice in India, which may be accepted\r\nwith a little salt. The administration of justice in India is impartial\r\nand as fair as it can be under the circumstances, except when one party\r\nis a native and the other a Britisher. What concerns us here, is\r\nProfessor Pratt’s opinion about the resident Englishman’s knowledge of\r\nIndia. In his opinion “most of the Englishmen” whom he met seemed to him\r\n“singularly lacking in curiosity or interest” about “Indian thought,\r\nreligion, traditions and ways of viewing things.” “The Anglo-Indian,”\r\nadds he, “is surprisingly indifferent towards almost everything native.”\r\nProfessor Pratt illustrates his conclusions by actual facts which came\r\nunder his observation. One English gentleman who had lived in Calcutta\r\nand other parts of the East for many years, said to the professor: “The\r\nnatives are all just a lot of animals, don’t you think so?” No wonder\r\nthat the professor had to say that his impression was quite different.\r\nFor him it was hard to conceive how one “could stay any time among them\r\nwithout finding them a truly lovable people, and without imbibing\r\ngenuine respect and admiration for the simple dignity of their lives,\r\nthe quiet courtesy of their manners, their uncomplaining endurance of\r\nhardships, their unbounded hospitality, and the feeling for spiritual\r\nvalue, which in spite of gross superstitions is unmistakable in the\r\nIndian atmosphere.” Professor Pratt’s “Englishman” had never heard of a\r\nDr. Bose, “one of the greatest botanists living,” and he did “not think\r\nmuch” of Tagore’s poetry. “This lack of interest in native life as\r\nsuch,” continues Mr. Pratt, “and the proud manifestation of conscious\r\nsuperiority that goes with it, shows itself in the coarser natures _in a\r\ncontempt for the ‘black man’_ and ‘a constant swagger of putting him in\r\nhis place.’ As a result of this indifference to and _contempt for the\r\nnatives_, most of the Anglo-Indians that I know anything about are very\r\nignorant concerning the religions of India, and _decidedly prejudiced\r\nagainst them_. Personally I think that the opinions of nine Englishmen\r\nout of ten on the subject of Indian religions are _entirely\r\nuntrustworthy_.”[1]\r\n\r\nProfessor Pratt only speaks of the English residents’ ignorance of\r\nIndian religion, but I am disposed to add that the opinions of\r\nninety-nine out of every hundred Anglo-Indians on the nature and effects\r\nof British rule in India and the capacity of Indians to manage their own\r\naffairs are equally “_untrustworthy_.” Hence the colossal ignorance\r\nwhich prevails in the West about what is happening in India politically\r\nand economically. Just think of an honest, fair-minded British writer,\r\nlike Lowes Dickinson, presuming to write about political life in India\r\nwithout discussing the economic effects of British rule.\r\n\r\nIndia being only a dependency, her affairs do not attract that attention\r\nwhich they would if she were a self-governing country. The British\r\nParliament disposes of the Indian affairs by an annual discussion of a\r\nfew hours in an extremely thin house. The last time the British House of\r\nCommons discussed an important measure affecting India, viz.: one by\r\nwhich it was proposed to suspend the Indian Civil Service examination\r\npending the war and to authorise the Secretary of State in Council to\r\nmake appointments by nomination, the maximum attendance, it is said,\r\nnever exceeded 28. This measure was condemned by the unanimous voice of\r\nthe Indian native press, yet there was nobody in the House to give\r\nexpression to their views in the matter. The author, himself, has\r\nattended the sittings of the House in different years, when the India\r\nbudget was under _discussion_ and can testify from personal knowledge\r\nthat the attendance was _always_ very scanty and the speeches, often,\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nYet the fact that India is inhabited by about one-fifth of the whole\r\nhuman race and that her trading capacity is simply unlimited, entitles\r\nher to a fuller consideration at the hands of the civilised world.\r\nLeaving aside her past, it can not be doubted that she is destined to\r\nplay a great part in the development of the near future. As such, the\r\nwriter has presumed that the following brief account of the rise and\r\ndevelopment of the Indian Nationalist Movement may not be devoid of\r\ninterest to British and American readers. The book is of course open to\r\nthe objection that it is written by a “native,” but in the eyes of\r\nimpartial investigators that should be its merit. The writer has been\r\nclosely associated with the movement for the last thirty-three years of\r\nhis life, in almost all its phases, religious, social, educational,\r\nindustrial and political. It was in 1888 that he joined the Indian\r\nNational Congress, the official organisation of the “constitutional”\r\nnationalists, i.e., only four years after it was started.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages he has tried to give as faithful an account of\r\nthe origin and progress of the movement as is possible under the\r\ncircumstances. The one fact which qualifies him to interpret the Indian\r\nNationalist Movement is that his position has always been more or less\r\ndetached. He has generally had the confidence of all sections as far as\r\nthe broad outlines of their policy were concerned, without identifying\r\nhimself with each and every item of their respective programmes.\r\nWhenever occasionally or incidentally he has happened to know of any\r\nprojected violence, without exception he has used his influence toward\r\nrestraint. By a timely exercise of his influence he once (1908)\r\nsucceeded in saving the lives of one Lieutenant Governor and one College\r\nPrincipal. The conduct of the British in India and their denial of the\r\nfundamental rights of the people, however, continue to add fuel to the\r\nfire and make it impossible for the friends of the constitutional\r\nmovement to stop or effectually check the employment of physical force.\r\nPersonally the writer is disposed to agree with the Lieutenant Governor\r\nof the Punjab, who said the other day, that open rebellion was morally\r\nless heinous than a campaign of underhand violence by bombs and\r\nrevolvers; but what the Lieutenant Governor forgot to notice was that\r\nopen rebellion by a subject people must always, in the nature of things,\r\nbe preceded by secret propaganda and secret preparations. Secret\r\npreparations in a country like India, access to which is on all sides\r\ncontrolled by the British, are bound to bring in the use of explosives\r\nand the taking of measures which might paralyse the administration and\r\nweaken its hold on the people. If a Government muzzles its people, shuts\r\nout all open avenues of political propaganda, denies them the use of\r\nfirearms and otherwise stands in the way of a free agitation for\r\npolitical changes, it is doubtful if it can reasonably complain of\r\nsecret plots and secret propaganda as distinguished from open rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe American press has of late been giving out different versions of the\r\npolitical situation in India. One version affirms that India is on the\r\npoint of rebellion; the other that India is devotedly loyal. Both\r\nstatements are partially true and both are partially false. India is not\r\ndevotedly loyal, yet to all appearances she is so. Nor is India on the\r\nverge of rebellion, though she is full of rebellious spirit. It is\r\npreposterous to contend that her expressions of loyalty on the outbreak\r\nof the war are proof that she is satisfied with British rule as it is.\r\nThe anti-British movement is spreading and gaining strength every day,\r\nand it is impossible for the British Government without the aid of the\r\nIndian people to uproot what the British are pleased to characterise as\r\n“Anarchism.”\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAmong other criticisms, to which this book may be subjected, I\r\nanticipate one or two on historical grounds which I would like to answer\r\nbeforehand. It may be said that I have painted the early history of\r\nIndia as “a golden age”; that my references to Chandra Gupta and Asoka\r\nshow only the bright side of the shield and that I have throughout\r\nassumed that India is, and has always been, a political unity. Now in\r\nconsidering this criticism, it should be borne in mind that my sole\r\nobject in referring to the past history of India is to show to my reader\r\nthat India was not a barbarous country when the British obtained\r\npossession of her, that she has had a long and in some respects a\r\nglorious history; that she was never before governed by foreigners from\r\nwithout in the political and economic interests of a nation not living\r\nwithin her territorial limits, as she has been and is being governed\r\nunder the British. Whatever may be my personal opinions about ancient\r\nIndia and her civilisation, I have sufficient knowledge of the Occident\r\nto understand that the Western reader is liable to have some hesitancy\r\nabout accepting them in all cases as historical truths. I have therefore\r\ncarefully avoided making any statements for which I can not cite good\r\nauthority. The statements made may be roughly divided into three kinds:\r\n(1) those relating to pre-Buddhist India, (2) those relating to India of\r\n500 B. C. to about 1000 A. D., (3) those relating to India of Mohammedan\r\ndomination.\r\n\r\nNow, as regards the first, we have no strictly historical data and the\r\nstatements are based on the contents of the literature of the period,\r\nviz., the religious treatises, the law books of the Hindus, and the\r\nepics. There is enough in this mass of literature to justify the modest\r\nstatements made in the first chapter of this book about that period of\r\nIndian history, and, if necessary, I would be able to quote good\r\nauthority for every statement made by me. Coming to the next period,\r\nviz., from 500 B. C. to 1000 A. D., we have enough historical data in\r\nthe writings of the Greeks, the Chinese and the Mohammedans to justify\r\nthe general statements made. It may be that my statements about this\r\nperiod are not complete, but that is because I am not writing a history\r\nof the period. I am only making an incidental reference for the purposes\r\nof this volume. For these purposes it is not necessary to trace the\r\norigin of Chandra Gupta’s rule, or to state his motives for instituting\r\na department of commerce or a department of vital statistics. Chandra\r\nGupta himself may have been a “villain,” but there is ample historical\r\ndata for an historian like Vincent Smith[2]--a retired Indian Civil\r\nServant by no means partial to India[3]--to conclude that “the foregoing\r\nreview of the civil and the military system of government during the\r\nreign of Chandra Gupta proves clearly that Northern India in the time of\r\nAlexander the Great had attained to a high degree of civilisation\r\n_which must have been the product of evolution continued through many\r\ncenturies_.”[4]\r\n\r\nAs for Asoka, Vincent Smith has discredited the stories of his having\r\nbeen guilty of excesses ascribed to his early career by other\r\nhistorians. In any case, all historians are unanimous about the\r\nexcellence of his administration. “The lofty moral tone of these edicts”\r\n(_i.e._, Asoka’s edicts), says Rawlinson (page 27 of “Indian Historical\r\nStudies”), “indicates clearly enough that India in the third century B.\r\nC. was a highly civilised country; it must, indeed, have compared\r\nfavourably with the rest of the world of the time; for Greece was\r\nsinking fast into a state of corrupt decadence, and Rome, in the throes\r\nof her struggle with Carthage, had scarcely yet emerged from barbarism.”\r\nNo Indian need make any higher claim than this for the India of the\r\nthird century B. C. Finally, as about the political unity of India in\r\nthe past, let it be noted that I do not claim that India was _always_\r\nunited under one political authority or even under one political system.\r\nAt the same time it is equally untrue that India was never a political\r\nunity. Most of the British writers are disposed to deny that there has\r\nbeen or is any kind of unity in India. This may be disposed of by the\r\nfollowing quotation from Vincent Smith’s “Early History of India” (page\r\n5): “India, encircled as she is by seas and mountains, is indisputably a\r\ngeographical unit, and, as such, is rightly designated by one name. Her\r\ntype of civilisation, too, has many features which differentiate it\r\nfrom that of all other regions of the world, while they are common to\r\nthe whole country, or rather sub-continent, in a degree sufficient to\r\njustify its treatment as a unity in the history of the social, religious\r\nand intellectual development of mankind.”[5] He adds, however, that “the\r\n_complete_ political unity of India under the control of a permanent\r\npower, wielding unquestioned authority, is a thing of yesterday, barely\r\na century old. The most notable of her rulers in the olden time\r\ncherished the ambition of universal Indian dominion, and severally\r\nattained it in a greater or lesser degree; not one of them, however,\r\nattained it completely.” The point admits of great controversy and\r\nanything like a proper discussion would add to the bulk of this book so\r\nmuch as would be out of proportion to its bearing on the main subject.\r\nMr. Vincent Smith admits that Asoka’s Empire included the whole of India\r\nproper except a tiny bit of the Southern peninsula lying between Nellore\r\nand Cape Comorin. (See map of Asoka’s Empire in his history, between\r\npages 162-163.) The exclusion of this bit is based not on any positive\r\nevidence that this part was not included within his empire, but on the\r\nabsence of positive evidence to the contrary. It is as if men living two\r\nthousand years after our day should expect it to be proved to their\r\nsatisfaction by positive documentary evidence that every bit of India\r\nwas included in the British Empire under Queen Victoria. Again, the fact\r\nthat Asoka’s Empire did not include the Southernmost part of the Indian\r\nPeninsula was more than compensated by the inclusion of almost the whole\r\nof Afghanistan and Beluchistan and Nepal in his dominions. The\r\nterritories comprising the kingdom of Nepal are not included in the\r\nBritish Empire, although they constitute a necessary part of India. Yet\r\neven Vincent Smith does not doubt that India is a political unity\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nThen again it is only very recently that he and other historians have\r\nfound out the data for a history of the Gupta Empire from 320 to 455 A.\r\nD., about the extent of which he says:\r\n\r\n“The dominions under the direct government of Samundra Gupta in the\r\nmiddle of the fourth century thus comprised all the populous and fertile\r\ncountries of Northern India.... Beyond those wide limits the frontier\r\nkingdoms of Assam and the Gangetic delta as well as those on the\r\nsouthern slopes of the Himalayas and the free tribes of Malwa and\r\nRajputana were attached to the Empire by bonds of subordinate alliance;\r\nwhile almost all the kingdoms of the South had been overrun by the\r\nEmperor’s armies and compelled to acknowledge his irresistible might.\r\n\r\n“Whatever may have been the exact degree of skill attained by Samundra\r\nGupta in the practice of the arts which graced his scanty leisure, it is\r\nclear that he was endowed with no ordinary powers; and that he was in\r\nfact a man of genius, who may fairly claim the title of the Indian\r\nNapoleon.\r\n\r\n“By a strange irony of fate this great king--warrior, poet, and\r\nmusician--who conquered nearly all India, and whose alliances extended\r\nfrom the Oxus to Ceylon--was unknown even by name to the historians\r\nuntil the publication of this work.[6] His lost fame has been slowly\r\nrecovered by the minute and laborious study of inscriptions and coins\r\nduring the last eighty years.”\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned, in passing, that monarchs of the Samundra Gupta\r\ntype, who may be compared easily with a Charlemagne, a Frederick or a\r\nPeter the Great, have flourished in India almost every second\r\ngeneration. Hindu folk-lore has known them as Vikramadityas (Suns of\r\nPower) and has invested their names with “the halo of Arthurian\r\nromance.” And this was a time in the history of the world when Egypt and\r\nBabylon had already passed away, when China was in a state of “anarchy,”\r\nwhen the Roman Empire was under the heels of the barbarians, and when\r\nthe Saracenic Empire (Caliphate) had not yet come into existence.\r\nEngland, France and Germany were simply _non est_.\r\n\r\nNow, the history of India before 1000 A. D. has not yet been completely\r\nconstructed, and who knows but that by future researches some other\r\nSamundra Guptas may be discovered? But in any case, the point is not so\r\nvery important. In that sense even now, India may not be called a\r\ncomplete political unity. It was not so in 1830 A. D. Up till 1849 the\r\nPunjab was independent and so were the other provinces annexed by Lord\r\nDalhousie. So Vincent Smith’s claim, that it has been so since 1818 A.\r\nD.[7] is not well founded. What is more important for our purpose is the\r\npresent and the future. It is claimed that under the British, India is a\r\npolitical unity though Nepal is still independent.\r\n\r\nThe critics of Indian aspirations are very unfair, when they compare the\r\nIndia of the seventeenth or the eighteenth or even of the nineteenth\r\ncentury with Great Britain, Germany, France and United States of the\r\ntwentieth. They forget that the political nations known by these names\r\nare only the growth of yesterday. India is as big as the whole of Europe\r\nexcluding Russia. Yet what was Europe before the nineteenth century? It\r\nwas a big camp of warring nations and warring religions, engaged in\r\nexterminating and persecuting each other alternately. India was more or\r\nless a political unity when Great Britain was smarting under the heels\r\nof the Romans. It took the British over 1600 years to establish their\r\npresent political unity. Compare the following account of “England under\r\nforeign rule” (1013-1204), given by Green in his “Short History of the\r\nEnglish People,” with the condition of things in India from the time of\r\nSamundra Gupta onwards.\r\n\r\n“Britain had become England in the five hundred years that followed the\r\nlanding of Hengest, and its conquest had ended in the settlement of its\r\nconquerors.... But whatever titles kings might assume, or however\r\nimposing their rule might appear, Northumbrian remained apart from West\r\nSaxon, Dane from Englishman.\r\n\r\n“Through the two hundred years that lie between the flight of Aethelred\r\nfrom England to Normandy and that of John from Normandy to England our\r\nstory is a story of foreign rule. Kings from Denmark were succeeded by\r\nkings from Normandy, and these by kings from Anjou. Under Dane, Norman,\r\nor Angevin, Englishmen were a subject race, conquered and ruled by\r\nforeign masters; and yet it was in these years of subjection that\r\nEngland first became really England.... The English Lords themselves\r\nsank into a middle class as they were pushed from their place by a\r\nforeign baronage who settled on English soil.”\r\n\r\n“In 800 A. D.,” says Mr. West, in his modern history, revised edition,\r\npage 4, “Europe was still sunk deep in the barbarism that followed the\r\nlong anarchy of the invasions, and the brief revival of Charlemagne had\r\nnot gone far toward restoring civilisation. Schools and learning were\r\nalmost extinct; commerce hardly existed; communication between district\r\nand district was almost impossible; money was so scarce that revenue had\r\nto be collected in produce; and manners and morals were alike\r\ndeplorable.” There has been hardly any period in the history of India\r\nabout which anything so disparaging can be said. Again says Mr. West,\r\n“From 814 to about 1100, Europe had three centuries of ‘Dark Ages,’\r\ncaused by a new series of barbarian invasions and continued by ‘feudal’\r\nviolence of the local military organisation that society adopted to ward\r\noff these invasions.” In fact Europe was in constant war right up to\r\n1870, and the idea of nationhood had not developed till late in the\r\nnineteenth century. It is then not right to taunt the Indians with the\r\nabsence of a perfected nationality in their country. Yet it can not be\r\ndenied that the idea of nationhood is being developed pretty fast in\r\nIndia, even on modern lines. In fact I maintain that fundamentally India\r\nhas been a nation for the last 2000 years, in spite of the fact that at\r\ntimes it has been divided into several kingdoms and principalities,\r\nsometimes under a common empire and in other times independent of each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nBut even if the worst happens and India is split up into a number of\r\npolitical units, what then? To me this does not appear to be so\r\nappalling as it may seem to others. Some Indians think that in any case\r\nit is better to be _men_ fighting their own battles than to be mere\r\n_creatures_ always in the leading strings of others. They have no faith\r\nin “peace at any price” or in “peace under any circumstances.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThis book was written when I was travelling in the United States from\r\nJanuary to May, 1915. It was ready for the press in June, 1915. Its\r\npublication has been delayed by causes which need not be stated.\r\n\r\nSince then much has happened in India which bears upon the subject and\r\nmight briefly be referred to here.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1915 something like organised anarchy and disorder broke out in\r\nthe Southwestern districts of the Punjab, resulting in the free looting\r\nof many villages in several districts. This lawlessness was due to war.\r\nIt is said that the police and the officers were overtaken by panic and\r\norder was not restored until strong measures were taken from the\r\nheadquarters. About 4000 persons were arrested in connection with these\r\ndisturbances and some 800 of them were sentenced to different terms of\r\nimprisonment, the rest being acquitted for want of evidence.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1914 and in the first few months of 1915 the Punjab\r\nwas the scene of many dacoities and murders, committed by and under the\r\ninspiration of Indians who had returned to India from abroad to take\r\nadvantage of the war situation for political purposes. Some of these\r\npersons had gone from Canada; some from China; and some from the Pacific\r\nCoast of the United States. Amongst them were a large number of those\r\nwho had been refused admission into Canada by the Canadian authorities\r\nand who had suffered enormously by their trip to Canada and back. The\r\nfirst clash between the latter and the Government took place at Budge\r\nBudge,[8] in Bengal, where the returned emigrants from Canada landed in\r\norder to proceed to their homes in the Punjab. The Government wanted to\r\nrestrict their freedom of movement and would not let them go to\r\nCalcutta, whither a number of them wanted to proceed. These persons had\r\nconcealed arms in their possession, and it appears that there was a free\r\nfight between them and the police, resulting in fatal casualties on both\r\nsides. About this time or a little later, the Government of India passed\r\na special law, authorising officials to intern or imprison any person or\r\npersons in British India without trial, on mere suspicion of his or\r\ntheir being dangerous to the tranquillity of the country. Under this law\r\nthey began to intern a large number of those who had returned from\r\nCanada and the United States and other places outside India, until the\r\nnumber reached to thousands. Most of them, perhaps, were kept only under\r\nsurveillance. Yet a good many of them managed to put themselves into\r\ncommunication with the revolutionary party in India and eventually\r\norganised a “widespread conspiracy” to subvert British rule. The\r\nGovernment discovered this conspiracy by means of spies, who entered\r\ninto the designs of the conspirators as “_agents provocateurs_.” It\r\nappears from the evidence subsequently given before the special tribunal\r\nappointed to try those who were arrested in connection with this\r\nconspiracy, that their plans were laid out on a comprehensive scale,\r\nwith everything organised in a perfect way; that full provision had been\r\nmade for finances as well as arms, and that the army had been approached\r\nwith more or less success at different places in Northern India. At\r\nfirst a batch of about 65 were placed for trial before the special\r\ntribunal consisting of two English judges and one Indian. This tribunal\r\nwas formed under the special law referred to above, and its decision was\r\nto be final in the sense that no appeal could be made from it to any\r\nother superior court. The tribunal eventually found that the conspiracy\r\nwas seditious in its nature, and but for its timely discovery would have\r\nresulted in “widespread disaster.” The proceedings of the tribunal were\r\nnot open to the public nor to the press. A brief report of the\r\nproceedings was issued from day to day under the authority of the\r\ntribunal. Some of the accused could not be found. Out of the 61 charged,\r\nonly 4 were acquitted, 6 were sentenced to various terms of\r\nimprisonment, 27 to transportation for life,[9] and 24 to death.[10]\r\nCommenting on this trial, the Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab observed\r\nin the course of a speech made in the Punjab Legislative Council held on\r\nSeptember 25, 1915, that “these crimes did all over the Central Punjab\r\nfrom November, 1914, to July, 1915, create a state not only of alarm and\r\ninsecurity, but of terror and even panic, and if they had not been\r\npromptly checked by the firm hand of authority and the active\r\nco-operation of the people, would have produced in the province as was\r\nintended by the conspirators a state of affairs similar to that of\r\nHindustan in the mutiny[11]--paralysis of authority, widespread\r\nterrorism and murder not only of the officers of the Government but of\r\nloyal and well disposed subjects.” What is significant is, that the\r\nleader, Rash Behari Bose, a Bengalee, who had organised several such\r\nconspiracies, escaped. Commenting upon the same trial, the _Times of\r\nIndia_, an influential Anglo-Indian paper published in Bombay, remarked:\r\n\r\n“If this conspiracy had been disclosed in ordinary times there might\r\nhave been a tendency to regard the members as representative of a\r\nconsiderable class of India ... but, as it is, the revolutionary party\r\nstands out a mere fraction of the population, a dangerous and determined\r\nsection of the population perhaps, yet so small that it can not command\r\nany chance of success while the sentiment of the country remains what it\r\nhas been so splendidly proved to be.”\r\n\r\nCommenting upon the severity of the sentences inflicted, the Indian\r\npress took occasion to point out the grievous wrongs under which the\r\ncountry suffered at the hands of the British. After the conclusion of\r\nthis case, over 100 persons more were indicted at Lahore[12] and a large\r\nnumber at Benares, in connection with the same conspiracy. Besides, a\r\nnumber of men belonging to the military were tried and convicted in\r\ndifferent stations in Northern India.\r\n\r\nIn Bengal political crime was rampant in a virulent form throughout\r\n1915. The Bengalee revolutionaries have kept the Government pretty busy\r\nall along the line, murdering police officials, looting treasuries, and\r\ncommitting dacoities, sometimes under the very nose of the police in the\r\nheart of the metropolis, resulting occasionally in so-called pitched\r\nbattles between the police and the revolutionaries. Numberless trials\r\nhave been going on in special tribunals constituted under the Defense of\r\nIndia Act, as well as in the ordinary courts. Large numbers of persons\r\nhave been punished and equally large numbers are still undergoing trial.\r\n\r\nThere was a serious rising in Singapore, which was eventually put down\r\nwith the help of the Japanese and French troops, and in connection with\r\nwhich a good many European lives were lost. Similarly, men smuggling\r\narms and seditious literature, or attempting to smuggle arms, or\r\notherwise carrying on anti-British propaganda, have been discovered,\r\narrested and held in Burma, Singapore, Hongkong, Shanghai and Ceylon. A\r\nlarge number of Indians are in internment in Hongkong. Two Indian\r\nrevolutionaries were deported from Japan, at the instance of the British\r\nGovernment, and several have been, I hear, interned in Java by the\r\norders of the Dutch Government. Har Dayal and several others have been\r\nactive in Europe and Asia Minor. The Hindu revolutionaries in the United\r\nStates have also been busy in their propaganda. It is said that the\r\nGermans have been helping the Indians with funds and arms. How far they\r\ndid render any substantial help in this matter is not known, but the\r\nconclusion of the Lahore Special Tribunal, that it was known to the\r\nleaders of the “Gadar” party in San Francisco in 1914, that a war\r\nbetween the British and Germans was on the _tapis_ in August of that\r\nyear, appears to be without foundation. The Indians who left the United\r\nStates in 1914 to organise a rebellion in India, were neither financed\r\nnor otherwise inspired by the Germans. They went of their own accord,\r\nwith their own money and on their own hook. Some of them were men of\r\nmeans. It may be true, however, that the Germans have helped the Indian\r\nrevolutionaries with money and arms since. So much about the\r\nrevolutionaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nNow something about the activity of the other wing of the Indian\r\nnationalists. When the war started, all of them declared for England,\r\nsome sincerely, others for reasons of expediency. All were influenced by\r\nhopes of advancing their cause. For a time the appreciation in\r\nEngland--in and out of Parliament--amply justified their expectations.\r\nThe first shock came when the British War Office refused to accept the\r\noffers of the Indian students in British universities to enlist in the\r\narmy or as volunteers. The same fate met the offers of educated Indians\r\nin India. The offers made by some native princes and in a few cases by\r\nother members of the aristocracy for personal service were accepted,\r\notherwise no relaxation in favour of any Indian was made in the rules\r\nfor enlistment in the regular army or in the volunteers. The following\r\nextracts from the two leading Indian dailies of Calcutta and Allahabad\r\nwill explain what I mean. The _Bengalee_ of Calcutta said:\r\n\r\n“When the war suddenly broke out in Europe there was a great outburst of\r\nfeeling in India to serve the Empire in any capacity. There was a\r\nwidespread desire among the more ardent spirits in this country to fight\r\nin defence of the Empire, and in Bengal, at any rate, there was an eager\r\nrush to enlist as volunteers. These young men were willing to cast aside\r\ntheir attitude of aloofness from what was primarily England’s concern.\r\nThey set before themselves a new ideal, the ideal of national\r\nself-realisation. By their participation in this struggle they felt they\r\nwould be fighting the battles of their own freedom. It was the highest\r\ntribute the Government could expect from the people of this country of\r\ntheir loyalty and devotion to the throne. But the chill air of official\r\nscepticism nipped the scheme in the bud. We were told at the time not to\r\nembarrass the Government in any way; but we still lived in hopes that\r\nsome means might be devised which would enable our young men to\r\nparticipate in this struggle so that from comradeship in arms there\r\nmight arise comradeship in life leading to the necessary elevation of\r\nour status in the Empire. But a bureaucracy, with its instinctive\r\ndisregard of others’ feelings and interests, not only threw cold water\r\non this salutary scheme but applied its mind to forging new fetters of\r\nrepression. Thus the Defense of the Realm Act came to be passed, which\r\nis far more drastic and stringent than the similar statute in England.\r\nInternments have since become the order of the day. The whole thing\r\noffers a painful illustration of the psychology of the bureaucratic mind\r\nin its endeavour to breed loyalty and prevent disaffection. For while\r\nthe spontaneous offer of our people, which was the outcome of a generous\r\nimpulse and of genuine sentiments of loyalty and devotion, has been\r\nrefused, fresh doses of repression are being applied to the wound thus\r\ninflicted on the minds of the people. But the crisis is not yet over,\r\nnor has the rising tide of feeling in this country completely subsided.\r\nThere is a demand for men, always for more men, at the front. It seems\r\nwe can not have too many men or too much of munitions if we desire a\r\ncrushing victory. All the factories of England--and every available\r\nfactory has been utilised for the manufacture of munitions of war--are\r\nworking at top speed for the production of powder and shells for cannon.\r\nAs regards men, volunteers are pouring forth from Canada, Australia, New\r\nZealand and the mother country itself, in fact from all parts of the\r\nBritish Empire, except India. Can any one say why this invidious\r\ndistinction is yet maintained? Why, while gifts of every sort from us\r\nare gladly accepted, the most precious gift of all, that of personal\r\nservice with all the attendant risk that it implies, continues to be so\r\nunwelcome? Lord Kitchener is still calling for men. Mr. Bonar Law’s\r\nrecent speech at Shrewsbury indicates that even conscription may have to\r\nbe resorted to. Why not then accept the offers of our men? The regular\r\ntroops in the fighting line have earned no end of praise from the\r\nhighest authorities for the display of their martial qualities. The\r\nAmbulance Corps shows the latest potentialities in our young men that\r\nare capable of development under proper guidance and training. We have\r\nnot the slightest doubt that our volunteers would prove themselves\r\nequally fit and capable, no matter what the duties they are called upon\r\nto discharge. This war is said to be a war of democracy against\r\nmilitarism and autocracy, a holy war of justice and righteousness\r\nagainst the violation of international morality and the independence of\r\nsmall nations. Are these assertions strictly consistent with the refusal\r\nof our loyal offer, which also amounts to a denial of our equality of\r\nstatus with the rest of the Empire? If, during the heat of the war and\r\nin the midst of the crisis, there be yet observed and maintained this\r\npatent inequality of treatment and this assertion of racial superiority,\r\nhow can we expect that they will be altogether forgotten or cast aside\r\nafter the war when the readjustment comes to be made? Repression, we\r\nrepeat for the hundredth time, is a disintegrating force. It alienates\r\nsympathies, destroys union and throws people into camps. Co-operation on\r\nthe other hand is a healing and a cementing principle. But without\r\nequality of treatment there can not be any co-operation, and without\r\nco-operation there can not be any prospect of permanent peace. By\r\naccepting our offer the Government may give an earnest of future reforms\r\nand concessions. It will sensibly ease and improve the situation both\r\nhere and at the front. But bureaucracy has so far failed to realise the\r\nsituation and avail itself of the opportunity. Let not the words ‘too\r\nlate’ be written by the future historian, regarding the action of the\r\nbureaucracy in this chapter of the history of India.... India wants\r\nequality of status with the rest of the Empire, and as a means to this\r\nend her sons want to fight as volunteers in this war; and if what Burke\r\nhas said be true of Englishmen, neither the one nor the other of India’s\r\nclaims can be justly denied to her.”\r\n\r\nIn its issue of September 8, 1915, the _Leader_, of Allahabad, said:\r\n\r\n“The not unkindly critics of John Bull have often remarked that he has\r\ngot a stolid temperament and an unemotional nature. The occasions are\r\nfew and far between when he allows himself to be swayed by any strong\r\noutburst of passion. One such exception to this general course of\r\nconduct was furnished last year at the outbreak of the war.... When Lord\r\nHardinge wired to England the message of India, her ungrudging and\r\nwhole-hearted response to the call of the hour, its announcement in the\r\nHouse of Commons touched the deepest chords in the hearts of Englishmen.\r\nThen, for once, they let themselves go. There was almost a storm of\r\nEnglish emotion. Even the _Times_ thought that it foreshadowed a great\r\nchange in the relations of India and England. ‘Asiaticus’ joined the\r\nchorus and swelled the pæan of the praise of Indian loyalty. He recanted\r\nhis words of former days. He even praised Mr. Tilak. Mr. Roberts spoke\r\nof a change in the angle of vision. Other statesmen and other papers\r\nuttered the same language of joy and hope. All this naturally raised the\r\nhopes of India. Some, more imaginative than others, conjured up visions\r\nof glory. They imagined they could see the distant gleam of\r\nself-government. Others again, with a less imaginative nature, thought\r\nthat even if self-government was still a far-off dream, they might yet\r\nsee better days. The landing of Indian troops on the European soil was\r\nthe signal for the outburst of another demonstration of feeling. Their\r\nheroic deeds, their unquestioning devotion to duty, formed the theme of\r\nsketch writers and leader writers in the English press. And yet to any\r\none who has closely followed the course of events during the last six or\r\nseven months and studied the writings of the English press and the\r\nutterances of notable Englishmen in England and India, nothing is more\r\nclear than that an ominous reserve has again overtaken the English mind.\r\nMr. Bonar Law talks of a consultation with the colonies, and forgets the\r\nvery existence of India. Mr. Austen Chamberlain, since the day he\r\nassumed his office, has put a seal on his lips, and, whatever may flow\r\nbeneath the surface from Downing Street to Delhi or Simla, nothing has\r\nfallen from his lips that can inspire confidence or kindle hope. The\r\nHouse of Lords have already given their reply to a sympathetic Viceroy,\r\nwhen, in the name of avoiding controversial issues, they shelved the\r\nquestion of an Executive Council for these provinces, which is another\r\nway of saying that they strangled it. Lord Curzon, Lord MacDonnel and\r\nLord Sydenham are not likely to learn the wisdom which the force of\r\nevents would teach to more plastic minds. If Indian students in England\r\napproach the higher authorities with a prayer that they may be admitted\r\nto the Officer’s Training Corps, they are told to wait--indefinitely. If\r\nSir George Scott Robertson, with imprudent enthusiasm, suggests the\r\ncreation of an Indian guard, he is roundly told that he is impatient.\r\n‘Asiaticus’ has again frankly gone back upon his short-lived liberalism,\r\nand Sir Valentine Chirol is no better. Convenience suggests the\r\npostponement of discussion of the Indian Budget, and the statute allows\r\nit. Out here in India the doctrine of unconditional loyalty is held up\r\nto us. We are told that it is a folly, if not a crime, to talk of what\r\nmay come to India when the time for readjustment comes. Meanwhile Indian\r\nspeculation, so natural to a nation of speculators, is roaming free.\r\nHopes spring up only to give place to fears....\r\n\r\n“There are not wanting men among us also who have only one counsel to\r\ngive, and that is, wait and see. No doubt the virtues of patience are\r\ngreat, but we think that so far as patience alone is concerned India may\r\neasily throw out a challenge to any nation in the world. If India will\r\nnot help herself she will have little reason to grumble if others will\r\nnot help her. Let us distinctly tell England that the time for half\r\nmeasures and gingerly reform has gone and that for bold and courageous\r\nsteps has come.”\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe Indian National Congress, the official organisation of the\r\nconstitutional party, held its annual session at Madras in December,\r\n1914. In the course of his speech, the President remarked:\r\n\r\n“If English rule in India meant the canonisation of a bureaucracy, if it\r\nmeant perpetual domination and perpetual tutelage, and increasing\r\ndead-weight on the soul of India, it would be a curse to civilisation\r\nand a blot on humanity.”\r\n\r\nAgain he asks complainingly:\r\n\r\n“The right to carry arms, the right to bear commissions in the Army and\r\nlead our men in the cause of the Empire, the right to form volunteer\r\ncorps in the defence of hearth and home, how long will these be denied\r\nto the Indian people? How long will India toddle on her feet, tied to\r\nthe apron-strings of England? It is time she stood on her own legs. If\r\nEngland were obliged, as was Imperial Rome in her day, to abandon India\r\nin the hour of some great danger, what could be more humiliating to\r\nEngland and to India alike, than for India to be left unarmed and\r\nuntrained in the use of arms, as her civil population now is, a prey to\r\ninternal anarchy and external aggression? What a commentary would it be,\r\non 150 years of British rule in India, that England found the people\r\nstrong though disunited and left them helpless and emasculated?”\r\n\r\nAt Christmas, 1915, the Congress again met under the presidency of Sir\r\nS. P. Sinha, who was in 1908 the first Indian appointed to be a member\r\nof the Governor General’s Executive Council, the British Cabinet in\r\nIndia. In the words of an Indian magazine, the speech delivered by him\r\nas coming from a man who has obtained “wealth, high position and honour”\r\nfrom the British connection and who has been “in the inner Councils of\r\nthe Government,” is most significant in its ideals as well as demands.\r\nHis ideal of a government for India has been borrowed from Abraham\r\nLincoln of the United States, viz., “Government of the people, _by the\r\npeople_, for the people.” He says:\r\n\r\n“What I do say is that there should be a frank and full statement of the\r\npolicy of Government as regards the future of India, so that hope may\r\ncome where despair holds sway and faith where doubt spreads its\r\ndarkening shadow, and that steps should be taken towards self-government\r\nby the gradual development of popular control over all departments of\r\nGovernment and by removal of disabilities and restrictions under which\r\nwe labour both in our own country and in other parts of the British\r\nEmpire.”\r\n\r\nAmong the definite reforms and remedial and progressive measures which\r\nhe demands are:\r\n\r\n“Firstly--The grant of commissions in the army and military training for\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n“Secondly--The extension of local self-government.\r\n\r\n“Thirdly--The development of our commerce, industries and agriculture.”\r\n\r\nRegarding the first he goes into details as follows:\r\n\r\n“1st. We ask for the right to enlist in the regular army, irrespective\r\nof race or province or origin, but subject only to prescribed tests of\r\nphysical fitness.\r\n\r\n“2nd. We ask that the commissioned ranks of the Indian army should be\r\nthrown open to all classes of His Majesty’s subjects, subject to fair,\r\nreasonable and adequate physical and educational tests, and that a\r\nmilitary college or colleges should be established in India where proper\r\nmilitary training can be received by those of our countrymen who may\r\nhave the good fortune to receive His Majesty’s commission.\r\n\r\n“3rd. We ask that all classes of His Majesty’s subjects should be\r\nallowed to join as volunteers, subject of course to such rules and\r\nregulations as will ensure proper control and discipline, and\r\n\r\n“4th. That the invidious distinctions under the Arms Act should be\r\nremoved. This has no real connection with the three claims, but I deal\r\nwith it together with the others as all these disabilities are justified\r\non the same ground of political expediency.”\r\n\r\nAs to the reasons why we should have self-government, he said:\r\n\r\n“A British Premier early in this century very truly observed, ‘Good\r\ngovernment can not be a substitute for self-government.’ Says a recent\r\nwriter in a well-known British periodical, ‘Every Englishman is aware\r\nthat on no account, not if he were to be governed by an angel from\r\nheaven, would he surrender that most sacred of all his rights, the right\r\nof making his own laws.... He would not be an Englishman, he would not\r\nbe able to look English fields and trees in the face, if he had parted\r\nwith that right. Laws in themselves, have never counted for much. _There\r\nhave been beneficent despots and wise law-givers in all ages who have\r\nincreased the prosperity and probably the contentment and happiness of\r\ntheir subjects but yet their government has not stimulated the moral and\r\nintellectual capacity latent in citizenship or fortified its character\r\nor enlarged its understanding. There is more hope for the future of\r\nmankind in the least and faintest impulse towards self-help,\r\nself-realisation, self-redemption, than in any of the laws that\r\nAristotle ever dreamt of._[13] The ideal, therefore, of self-government\r\nis one that is not based merely on emotion and sentiment, but on the\r\nlessons of history.”\r\n\r\nWhat is, however, most significant, is his reply to the criticism often\r\nmade by ignorant and prejudiced Englishmen and others as to what would\r\nbe the fate of India if England were to withdraw from India and as to\r\nthe Indians’ fitness to manage their affairs or to fight their battles.\r\nHe observes:\r\n\r\n“I take leave to point out, therefore, that it is not correct, at any\r\nrate at the present time, to assert of any sections of the Indian people\r\nthat they are wanting in such physical courage and manly virtues as to\r\nrender them incapable of bearing arms. But even if it were so, is it not\r\nthe obvious duty of England so to train them as to remove this\r\nincapacity, especially if it be the case, as there is some reason to\r\nbelieve, _that it is English rule which has brought them to such a\r\npass_? England has ruled this country for considerably over 150 years\r\nnow, and surely it cannot be a matter of pride to her at the end of this\r\nperiod that the withdrawal of her rule would mean chaos and anarchy and\r\nwould leave the country an easy prey to any foreign adventurers. There\r\nare some of our critics who never fail to remind us that if the English\r\nwere to leave the country to-day, we would have to wire to them to come\r\nback before they got to Aden. Some even enjoy the grim joke that were\r\nthe English to withdraw now, there would be neither a rupee nor a virgin\r\nleft in some parts of the country. I can conceive of no more scathing\r\nindictment of the results of British rule. A superman might gloat over\r\nthe spectacle of the conquest of might over justice and righteousness,\r\nbut I am much mistaken if the British nation, fighting now as ever for\r\nthe cause of justice and freedom and liberty, will consider it as other\r\nthan discreditable to itself _that after nearly two centuries of British\r\nrule India has been brought to-day to the same emasculated condition as\r\nthat of the Britons in the beginning of the fifth century_[14] when the\r\nRoman legions left the English shores in order to defend their own\r\ncountry against the Huns, Goths and other barbarian hordes.”\r\n\r\nThe reader may well compare this with the following observation made by\r\nthe present writer in a pamphlet[15] recently issued by him on the\r\npolitical situation in India.\r\n\r\n“The whole world is free to keep arms and use arms. Every civilised\r\nnation is interested in giving a military training to her boys and\r\ncitizens and in teaching them the use of arms and other military\r\ntactics. Some countries do this by conscription, others do it on a\r\nvoluntary basis. No government entitled to be called sane thinks of\r\ndenying arms to such of its people as want to use them for legitimate\r\npurposes. The free possession of arms and free training in military\r\ntactics for purposes of individual and national defence is the\r\nbirthright of every son of a mother. Even the Amir of Kabul does not\r\ndeny that to his people. Nations are vying with each other in their\r\nmilitary preparations and in giving military training to their citizens.\r\nEven China is thinking of introducing conscription. In Japan military\r\ntraining is compulsory. In some places even the girls learn the use of\r\narms and practise fencing. In the United States as well as in the other\r\nStates of America the negroes and the American Indians can keep arms and\r\nreceive military training. But the Indians of India can not keep arms.\r\nEvery nation is interested in the manufacture of arms and ammunition and\r\nin inventing effective methods of dealing with their enemies.\r\nGovernments give every encouragement to those who invent new arms or\r\nimprove old ones. All this is denied to the Indians.[16] Why? Because\r\nthey are a subject people. Their government cannot trust them. The\r\nstrength of the native army in India cannot exceed a certain proportion\r\nof the British army; they cannot handle the artillery; and numerous\r\nother restrictions are imposed upon the possession and use of arms by\r\nthem. Why? Are they not fit to handle arms? Are they not brave? Are they\r\nintemperate? None of these things can be said of them. Yet no Indian can\r\nget a commissioned rank, however high by birth or social position,\r\nhowever fit by education. No Indian can be admitted into a military\r\ncollege in India or in Great Britain. Why? Are they unfit, or\r\nintellectually and physically imbeciles? The truth is that the\r\nGovernment of India, not being their _own_ government, they cannot be\r\ntrusted. They can be enrolled as mere soldiers and that only in certain\r\nnumbers. Beyond that they cannot get any military training or military\r\nrank. Nor can the civil population be trusted to keep arms, much less\r\nto manufacture them. Much fuss has been made over the Indians having\r\nbeen allowed to participate in the European War. The Indians have gone\r\nmad over the incident, as if that were the greatest boon that could be\r\nconferred on them. The truth is that the step was actuated by and taken\r\npurely in British interests. Without the Indian contingent Great Britain\r\ncould not send a decent expeditionary force to France. The whole of the\r\nwhite army could not be removed from India. In removing large numbers of\r\nthem, it was necessary to remove proportionately large numbers of the\r\nnative army also. The British Government is always distrustful of the\r\nnative army. No amount of false statements and fallacious reasoning can\r\nconceal the fact that the British in India cannot allow the Indians to\r\nmanufacture or carry arms, cannot give them a military training, cannot\r\neven keep a large native army (more than double the strength of the\r\npermanent British garrison) because, being foreigners, they cannot trust\r\nthem. They fear that some day the arms or military training given them\r\nmay be used against themselves. Looking at it from their point of view,\r\nperhaps, it cannot be said that they may not be right. But then, why ask\r\nthe Indians to accept the pretence that the Government is national, and\r\nthat they are the equal subjects of the crown; why hide the truth and\r\nmake false and hypocritical declarations to the contrary? The British\r\nknow the weakness of their rule in India, and in the disarming of the\r\npeople they see the best guarantee of the continuance of their own rule\r\nand power. In the matter of arms, the present situation in India is\r\nthis. One may steal arms; one may smuggle them; one may illicitly\r\npurchase them, from those who have the freedom of possessing, for the\r\npurpose of committing crime, but one cannot have them for defending his\r\nlife and property, or the life and honour of his family (wife, mother,\r\nsisters, and daughters).[17]\r\n\r\n“It is this which gives awful power to the lawless portions of society\r\nand which explains the losses and hardships of those who have suffered\r\nfrom the depredations of the latter and are suffering from dacoities and\r\nrobberies and murders in Bengal and Punjab and elsewhere. There are\r\nplenty of arms in the country for the criminal, but none for the\r\npeace-loving (who only want them for defensive purposes). All this\r\nbecause the Government of India is a foreign government which cannot\r\ntrust its subjects and which does not believe in their loyalty. In the\r\nlight of this fact, all talk about the extraordinary outburst of loyalty\r\nbecomes stale. So long as this state of things continues, it is useless\r\nfor the Government to expect that the people can accept it and treat it\r\nas if it was their own national government. Never before, since the\r\nintroduction of British rule in India, was the sense of helplessness,\r\nthat arises out of the consciousness of being a disarmed people,\r\nbrought home to the people of India so vividly and strongly as during\r\nthe war. A new fear has dawned on the public mind. Suppose the British\r\nlose, we are lost, says the Indian. The Germans may come or the Russians\r\nor even the Amir of Kabul, we cannot even make a show of resistance. A\r\npeople so helpless and dependent deserve to be despised by the world.\r\nThe war has made the Indian feel that, as a British subject, he is\r\nreally a despicable creature entitled to no consideration at the hands\r\nof the other people of the world. Even the negroes (whether in Africa or\r\nAmerica) are much better placed than he is. The prayers of Indian C. I.\r\nE.’s and Rai Bahadurs and Khan Bahadurs notwithstanding, the British\r\ncannot be invincible forever. The time is to come when their prowess in\r\narms will decay. What will then be the fate of India and Indians? Will\r\nthey be transferred like sheep? If they are not actually transferred by\r\nagreement, the nation replacing the English as the world power will take\r\npossession of India. The very idea is disquieting and crushingly\r\nhumiliating. But this is not the only circumstance which constantly\r\nreminds the Indian people that their Government is an alien Government,\r\nwhose interest in them is only secondary.”\r\n\r\nI will give one more quotation on this subject, and this time from the\r\nspeech of a Parsi gentleman of extremely moderate views. Says Mr. Wacha:\r\n\r\n“In connection with this war there is one serious disappointment to\r\nwhich I cannot refrain from making reference in this place. Many an\r\nenlightened and intelligent person, irrespective of caste and creed, in\r\nevery province of the Indian Empire, has applied, from the very date of\r\nthe declaration of war, to go to the front and fight side by side with\r\nthe soldiers of the regular Indian army. Even to-day thousands on\r\nthousands are willing and ready to take up arms in the great cause for\r\nwhich the Allies are fighting. But unfortunately, the permanent\r\nbureaucracy of the land has sternly, if politely, refused those\r\napplications, the why and the wherefore of which has never been made\r\nknown. It is this attitude of the Government, in the midst of the great\r\ntragic crisis, that has caused the bitterest disappointment to which\r\nmany a leading organ of public opinion has given full expression.\r\nRussia, which has millions of population but less numerous than that of\r\nIndia, has already raised and is still raising a popular army full of\r\nardour and patriotism to overcome the forces of the modern Vandals who\r\nare such enemies of liberty and freedom. The British Colonies are\r\nsimilarly raising corps after corps to give succour to the mother\r\ncountry, but strange to say, that while millions in India are on the qui\r\nvive to offer their services, a kind of proscription has gone forth from\r\nthe governing authorities that they shall not be enrolled. This is\r\nindeed an un-English attitude which is unreconcilable with the entire\r\npolicy of British administration in every other part of the Empire. I am\r\nonly echoing the universal sentiments and feelings of my countrymen when\r\nI venture to say in this place that the Rulers of India still seem to\r\nmistrust the people.”\r\n\r\nComparing the policy of the British with Imperial Rome, Mr. Wacha\r\nconcludes:\r\n\r\n“We all devoutly hope that profiting by this great achievement, Great\r\nBritain will not deny any further to the Indian people the exercise of\r\narms, _the want of which for so many years has led to their\r\nemasculation_.”[18]\r\n\r\nThis word “emasculation” affords the key to the situation in India from\r\nthe purely Indian point of view. Political, physical and economic\r\n“emasculation” is the keynote of British rule there, and however they\r\nmay cloak it with wrappings of pleasant and golden words, and however\r\nthey may conceal it in finely woven sentences, like the cloven feet it\r\nemerges at almost every step. The _Modern Review_ puts it well when it\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n“Under bureaucratic rule, India is the poorest, the most unhealthy and\r\nthe most ignorant among civilised countries, and her poverty and\r\nunhealthiness are not diminishing, and education is spreading at a\r\nslower pace than that of the snail. The remedy is Home Rule.”\r\n\r\nThere is another brief quotation which I will give, from the speech of\r\nthe President of the last session of the Indian National Congress, viz.,\r\nthe one relating to the poverty of India. He says: “Whatever differences\r\nof opinion may exist as to whether India is growing richer or poorer\r\nunder the British rule, there is none with regard to her extreme\r\npoverty. And there can never be political contentment without material\r\nprosperity, shared in by all classes of the people. What the District\r\nAdministration Committee of Bengal quotes with approval as regards\r\nBengal, that our industrial backwardness is a great political danger,\r\napplies in reality to the whole of India.\r\n\r\n“No one will be disposed to question the fact of this amazing\r\nbackwardness. _Rich in all the resources of nature, India continues to\r\nbe the poorest country in the civilised world._”[19]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nI do not propose to burden this preface with other complaints which the\r\nIndian politicians make against the British Government, but I can not\r\nrefrain from giving one more quotation from my own pamphlet on the\r\nquestion of Education:\r\n\r\n“Let us look at education in India. India has been under British rule\r\nnow for a century and a half in some parts, for over a century in\r\nothers, and for at least 65 years in the Punjab. Yet the percentage of\r\nilliteracy is well nigh 95 per cent., taking the whole of India.\r\nGreatest ignorance prevails among the peasantry and the military\r\nclasses, the two great bulwarks of British rule in India. What has the\r\nGovernment done to educate these classes? Nothing. Some maintain that\r\nthey have been deliberately kept out of education because, once\r\neducated, they may no longer be such willing tools as they are now.\r\n\r\n“Agriculture in India, as elsewhere, is the least paying of industries,\r\nand it is not at all strange that large numbers of sturdy Punjabees\r\nprefer to labour in other countries rather than rot on their farms in\r\nthe Punjab. In the early years of British rule the educated and the\r\ntrading classes flourished and became prosperous, but now they are\r\nthoroughly discontented. The native traders are no longer happy under\r\nBritish rule, (1) because the railways and foreign import and export\r\noffices dealing directly with the producer and the consumer have ruined\r\ntheir business, (2) because the facilities available to them in the\r\nearly days of British rule have disappeared, (3) because the bureaucracy\r\nis always inciting the agricultural and military classes against them\r\nand heaping insults on their devoted heads both by word and deed. In\r\nalmost every province, special legislation has been enacted professedly\r\nin the interests of the agricultural classes but really directed against\r\nthe Indian trader or money lender. On the other hand, what has the\r\nGovernment done to open non-agricultural pursuits to them? Nothing. In\r\nthe whole length and breadth of the country there is not a single\r\ntechnological institute. The private or aided technological institutes\r\nare called by that name only by courtesy. In these days of international\r\ntrade there is no provision in any of the Indian universities for the\r\nteaching of modern languages. While Germans, Austrians, Italians,\r\nAmericans and Japanese can learn Hindustanee and English in their own\r\ncountries in order to further their trade with India, the Government of\r\nIndia has never given a thought to the necessity of making a provision\r\nfor the teaching of German, French, Japanese, &c., to the Indians and of\r\nencouraging Indians to learn these languages. The best part of a boy’s\r\nstudent life is compulsorily spent in acquiring excellence in the use of\r\nthe English language. Indians are not supposed to know other languages\r\nor to trade with other countries, because the English do it for them. It\r\nis not the concern of the British to encourage the native to have direct\r\ncommercial transactions with foreign countries. There is not a single\r\nplace in India where an Indian student can do research work in chemistry\r\nor other sciences. While the country is full of mines, there is no place\r\nto learn mining. Hundreds of steamers come and go from Indian ports, but\r\nthere is no place in India where an Indian youth can qualify himself\r\neven for the merchant marine, not to speak of the navy. In the whole of\r\nIndia with its splendid resources, there is not a single place where\r\nships can be built. The Indian Government has never given a thought to\r\nthese questions because they do not concern them, because they are not\r\ninterested in the development of the indigenous industries and in\r\nraising the status of the people. They have done a lot to encourage the\r\nproduce of raw materials necessary for their industries or for their\r\nfood (cotton, wheat, oil, seeds, etc.), but almost nothing to encourage\r\nmanufacturing industries. Originally they wanted to preserve the Indian\r\nmarkets for themselves only, but their policy of free trade stood in\r\nthe way, and latterly the Germans and now the Japanese are sharing that\r\nmarket with them. But to teach the Indian to manufacture for his own\r\nconsumption has never entered the thought of those responsible for the\r\nadministration of India. Perhaps it is not right to say that it never\r\nentered their thought. They are too intelligent and shrewd not to know\r\nthat they had not done their duty to India in these matters, but the\r\ninterest of their own people was paramount and that they could not set\r\naside.\r\n\r\n“The British Government in India can not go in for universal elementary\r\neducation, as there is danger of even greater disaffection resulting\r\ntherefrom; they can not give technical education of a high order, as\r\nthat might interfere with British industries; they can not protect\r\nIndian industries for the same reason; they can not provide for real\r\nhigh class commercial education with a teaching of foreign languages and\r\na knowledge of seafaring and navigation, as they do not want the Indians\r\nto directly engage in oversea trade and contract relations with other\r\nnations. They can not protect and subsidise Indian industries, as that\r\nis opposed to free trade and detrimental to British industries. Yet they\r\nwant the Indians to believe that the British Government in India is\r\nprimarily conducted in the interests of India.\r\n\r\n“The people of India must remain ignorant, illiterate and industrially\r\nand commercially dependent because that benefits England and is for the\r\nadvantage of her people.\r\n\r\n“But that is not all. The Government of India can not even provide for\r\nhigh class education in sciences, in engineering, and in medicine, for\r\nthe simple reason that the higher positions in these professions they\r\nwant to reserve for their own people. Of late the number of Indians,\r\neducated and trained in these departments of knowledge in British and\r\nother foreign universities, has so increased as to become rather\r\nembarrassing to the Government of India. They can not utilise them\r\nwithout reducing the number of Britishers in these services. This they\r\ndo not desire. The result is that there are numbers of trained Indians\r\nin India with high class British and European qualifications who have to\r\nbe contented with subordinate positions under Britishers of lesser\r\nqualifications, and perhaps, at times, of no qualifications. The\r\ncompetitive examinations for higher services are held in England, which\r\nin itself is a great injustice; but this year on account of the war,\r\nthere being fewer qualified Britishers to compete for these services,\r\nthe Government has resolved to discontinue[20] some of the examinations,\r\nfor fear lest a larger number of Indians than is desirable might get\r\ninto them. Can they still say that the Government of India is as good as\r\nor perhaps better than a national government? The truth is that they do\r\nnot want a larger number of Indians in the higher services because they\r\ncan not trust them. For the same reason they distrust private\r\neducational institutions and insist upon the employment of Britishers as\r\ninspectors of schools and as professors in the educational service. They\r\nwill allow a certain number of Indians in the higher offices but that\r\nnumber must not be so large as to make it even remotely possible for\r\nthem to create trouble for the Government. The same fear underlies the\r\nadministration of local bodies and the constitution and powers of the\r\nCouncils. It is simply begging the question to argue that Indians are\r\nnot yet ready or fit for representative institutions. The real question\r\nis the dread of power passing from the Britishers into Indian hands.[21]\r\nIt is this dread that is the dominating influence in the policy of the\r\nBritish Government in India. India is a possession and a dependency and\r\nmust be administered in the best interests of the master. Many credulous\r\nIndians talk of the liberty-loving traditions of the British democracy,\r\nbut they forget that the application of these traditions to India would\r\nmake such big holes in their safes, purses, and incomes, that they as\r\nmen swayed by self-interest and love of power and glory, can never think\r\nof enforcing these principles in India. The British are good people. In\r\nall personal dealings they are honest, frank, and reliable. But when\r\nnational interests are at stake and when the interests of the nation\r\ndictate a different line of policy, they can not help following the\r\nlatter, however much injustice and hardship they may inflict upon others\r\nin doing so. The English political moralist and thinker believes and\r\npreaches that the state exists for the people, that state and people are\r\nreally interchangeable words, and that the teachings of Treitschke, that\r\nthe state is greater than the people and that the latter exists for the\r\nformer, is immoral and vicious. In Great Britain and the Colonies the\r\nBritish act as they believe, but in India they follow the doctrines of\r\nthe German professor. The state in India is an authority imposed from\r\nwithout and is therefore distinct from and independent of the\r\npeople.[22] The state in India is the British people, and therefore the\r\ninterests of the latter must override those of the Indian people.\r\nEverything in India is judged by that standard. The English may be good,\r\nbenevolent, just, kind, and fair-minded, but all these virtues are\r\ndominated by the supreme test mentioned above. All the real troubles of\r\nIndia arise from this circumstance. Everything connected with India is\r\nlooked at from this angle. Unless this angle changes there is no\r\npossibility of any such changes taking place in the system and the\r\npolicy of the Government of India as are likely to satisfy the\r\nself-respect of the Indian or to remove the disadvantages from which the\r\ncountry suffers.”\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThe most significant development of Nationalism, however, that has taken\r\nplace in the last year, is the unity between the Hindus and the\r\nMohammedans on the question of self-government. It is remarkable how the\r\nwar has united the Hindus and the Mohammedans, not only in their\r\nexpressions of loyalty to the Government, but also in their demand for\r\nHome Rule and in their dissatisfaction with the prevailing political\r\nconditions in India. For the first time in the history of Indian\r\nNationalism, the Indian National Congress and the All-India Muslim\r\nLeague have met in the same city. This was opposed with the whole of\r\ntheir might by the Ultra-Loyalists among the Mohammedans under the\r\ninspiration of their Anglo-Indian masters. The younger generation of the\r\nMohammedans, however, is so thoroughly filled with the idea of\r\nNationalism that they carried the day and succeeded in holding a very\r\nsuccessful session of their league at Bombay in the same week in which\r\nthe Indian National Congress was holding its session in that city. The\r\nresult was that the members of both organisations met, compared notes,\r\nexchanged civilities, and found out that there was practical unity among\r\nthem on all the important questions bearing upon their relations with\r\nthe Government. The Muslim League President made pronouncements\r\ndemanding self-government, free compulsory education, governmental help\r\nin industrial development, removal of restrictions against the progress\r\nof Indian industries, in almost the same terms and with the same\r\nemphasis, if not even greater, than the Indian National Congress did.\r\nBoth the organisations appointed a joint committee to draw up a scheme\r\nof Home Rule which would meet the needs and the approval of both the\r\ngreat religious communities inhabiting that great country.\r\n\r\nDuring the last year a scheme has been floated by Mrs. Annie Besant, the\r\npresident of the Theosophical Society, a woman of great ability and of\r\nworld-wide fame, who has adopted India as her home, but who at the same\r\ntime is a patriotic Englishwoman, to organise a Home Rule League for\r\nIndia, separate from and independent of both the Indian National\r\nCongress and the All-India Muslim League. This proposal has met with the\r\napproval of the advanced members of both the Hindu and Mohammedan\r\ncommunities. Some leaders of the Indian National Congress, however, see\r\na danger to their Congress in the growth and development of the Home\r\nRule League. But it is wonderful how the idea has caught hold of the\r\npublic mind. Practically the whole of the Nationalist press and the\r\nNationalist platform, with a few minor exceptions, have declared in\r\nfavour of the proposal. The supporters of the Home Rule League met at\r\nBombay to formally decide the question of giving practical effect to the\r\nidea which has received the joint support of both the Hindus and the\r\nMohammedans. Mrs. Besant, however, herself, has shrunk from organising\r\nit just now, out of deference to the opinions of some of the leaders of\r\nthe Indian National Congress, pending the report of the joint committee\r\nformed to formulate a scheme of Home Rule suited to India. Indian\r\nNationalism has thus advanced very much during the last year. We have\r\nthe two movements--one representing force, the other peaceful\r\nagitation--side by side, as has been the case in the history of similar\r\nmovements in other countries. One movement represents the more virile\r\nsection of the population who believe in force, violence and terrorism;\r\nthe other, those who depend upon appeal to reason, justice and\r\nconscience. The combined force of both, however, produces a momentum\r\nwhich is sure to become irresistible in the course of time. What is\r\nextremely hopeful is the entirely changed attitude of the Mohammedan\r\ncommunity. The British wished for and tried to create an _Ulster_ among\r\nthe Mohammedans of India. They had well nigh succeeded, but the last\r\nthree or four years have brought about a complete change. The Mohammedan\r\nmasses had really never joined the educated Mohammedan Separatists, but\r\neven the latter have now found out that the policy of separation from\r\nthe Hindus which was in their minds for some time, can not eventually\r\nbring any lasting good to their community. With their Hindu countrymen\r\nthey feel that India must occupy the first place in their affections and\r\nthoughts, and that it was not inconsistent for them to be Mohammedans in\r\nreligion and Indians in politics. Similarly, the Hindu sentiment, that\r\nwas growing somewhat anti-Mohammedan on account of the Mohammedan\r\nsentiment of separation, has been greatly softened. The Mohammedans\r\nhave begun to feel that they can share in the ancient glory of India\r\nwithout an outrage to their Mohammedanism. The Hindus have come to\r\nrealise that after all the Mohammedan rule in India was not so bad or\r\ntyrannical and oppressive as they were told it was by interested\r\nhistorians. The Mohammedans feel that they can be as proud of the Hindu\r\nheroes, Rama and Krishna, of the Hindu Epics, the Ramayana and the\r\nMahabharta, of Hindu science and Hindu philosophy, as the Hindus\r\nthemselves are, without being false to their religion or to their\r\ncommunity. Similarly the Hindus feel that they can be as proud of a Sher\r\nShah and an Akbar and a Shah Jahan, of Alberuni, of Ibn Batuta, of Abul\r\nFazal, Faizi and Gálib, as the Mohammedans can be. Nay, they can go a\r\nstep further and say that even Aurangzeb was not, after all, so bad as\r\nthey had supposed him to be. The Hindus and Mohammedans have discovered\r\nthat they can take part in their respective festivals and take pride in\r\ntheir respective past, without in any way being traitors to their\r\nrespective religions and communities.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nThat the above statements are not mere creations of my own brain, but\r\nare based on fact, will be easily seen from the following extracts which\r\nI make from the speech of the President of the last session of the\r\nAll-India Muslim League held at Bombay in December, 1915.\r\n\r\nFirst, about the representative character of the assembly, Mr.\r\nMazhar-ul-Haq remarked:\r\n\r\n“Please accept my sincere and heartfelt thanks for the great honour you\r\nhave done me by electing me the President of the All-India Muslim League\r\nthis year. It is a proud privilege to preside over and guide the\r\ndeliberations of this distinguished gathering, where representatives of\r\nseventy millions of his Britannic Majesty’s Indian Muslim subjects are\r\nassembled in conference for the betterment of their condition, and for\r\ncounsel and consultation together on the affairs of their country.”\r\n\r\nAbout the difficulties of the times he says:\r\n\r\n“Times are most unpropitious for expressing views and convictions which,\r\nin normal times of peace, there would have been no harm in frankly and\r\nunreservedly putting _before our community and our Government_. The\r\npresent terrible conflict of nations enjoins upon us the paramount duty\r\nof saying or doing nothing which would embarrass or weaken the hands of\r\nour Government by producing undesirable excitement in the people, or\r\nlead to any impression upon foreign nations that we are in any way\r\ninimical or even indifferent to the best interests of the Empire.”\r\n\r\nAs to how Islam established itself in India, how it spread and what is\r\nthe present position of the Mohammedans of India, he speaks as follows:\r\n\r\n“The first advent of the Muslims in India was along these very\r\ncoasts[23] in the form of a naval expedition sent by the third Khalif in\r\nthe year 636 A. D. This was more than four hundred years before William\r\nthe Conqueror defeated the Saxons at the battle of Hastings. After many\r\nvicissitudes, into the details of which it is unnecessary to go, the\r\nMuslim Empire was firmly established in India. These invaders made India\r\ntheir home and did not consider it a land of regrets. They lived amongst\r\nthe people of the country, mixed with them freely and became true\r\ncitizens of India. As a matter of fact they had no other home but India.\r\nFrom time to time their number was strengthened by fresh blood from\r\nArabia, Persia and other Muslim lands, but their ranks were swollen\r\nmainly by additions from the people of the country themselves. It is\r\nmost interesting to know that out of the present seventy millions of the\r\nMuslim population, those who have claimed their descent from remote\r\nnon-Indian ancestors amount only to eight millions. Whence have the\r\nremaining millions come, if not from Indian ranks? The Muslims enriched\r\nthe hoary civilisation of India with their own literature and art,\r\nevolved and developed by their creative and versatile genius. From the\r\nHimalayas to Cape Comorin the entire country is studded with those gems\r\nof art which remind one of the glorious period of Muslim rule. The\r\nresult was a new civilisation which was the outcome of the combined\r\nefforts of all the peoples of India and the product of the two great\r\ncivilisations in the history of the world. During Muslim times all\r\noffices were equally opened to all, without any distinction of class,\r\ncreed or colour. The only conditions were fitness and efficiency.\r\nSo we have the spectacle of a Hindu prime minister, a Hindu\r\ncommander-in-chief, a Hindu finance minister, and a Hindu governor of\r\nKabul. Ethnology and folklore of India speak eloquently of manners and\r\ncustoms showing the influence of one people upon the other. The only\r\nlink which the Muslims kept with the countries outside India was the\r\nspiritual link of their religion. This was under the circumstances\r\ninevitable. This short historical retrospect may be succinctly expressed\r\nin two words which fully and clearly describe the elements and\r\nconditions of our existence in India. We are Indian Muslims. These\r\nwords, ‘Indian Muslims,’ convey the idea of our nationality and of our\r\nreligion, and as long as we keep our duties and responsibilities arising\r\nfrom these factors before our eyes, we can hardly go wrong.\r\n\r\n“Indian Muslims are Indians first!\r\n\r\n“About what we owe to our non-Muslim fellow subjects I have never\r\nconcealed my opinion, and I can only repeat here what I have often said.\r\nI am one of those who have never taken a narrow and sectarian view of\r\nIndian politics. When a question concerning the welfare of India and of\r\njustice to Indians arises I am not only an Indian first, but an Indian\r\nnext and an Indian to the last, an Indian and an Indian alone, favouring\r\nno community and no individual, but on the side of those who desire the\r\nadvancement of India as a whole without prejudice to the rights and\r\ninterests of any individual, much less of any community, whether my own\r\nor another.\r\n\r\n“Policies and principles of a nobler kind may be laid down by higher\r\nauthorities, but their value is determined by those who have to carry\r\nthem out. Thus it has often been the case in India that noble intentions\r\nhave degenerated into pious wishes and even into harmful actions. If the\r\nIndian people were real partners in the actual governance of the\r\ncountry, the Indian point of view would have prevailed, much that is now\r\nadmitted to have been mistaken would have been avoided, the country\r\nwould have progressed and the ruling classes would have been spared the\r\nbitter and sometimes undeserved criticisms hurled against them. Unless\r\nand until India has got a national government and is governed for the\r\ngreatest good of the Indian people, I do not see how she can be\r\ncontented. India does not demand ‘a place in the sun’ in any aggressive\r\nsense, but she does require the light of the Indian sun for her own\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, let us descend a little from the generalities into details\r\nand see how the policy of the past has worked not only to our detriment,\r\nbut to the positive weakening of the British rule itself. Let us see\r\nwhat small share we have in the larger life of the Empire. I have\r\nalready said that we have no share in laying down the policy upon which\r\nIndia is ruled. Have we any share even in the different Services of the\r\ncountry? Are we allowed to serve our own land and the Empire to the best\r\nof our capacity and ability? In every country the three premier Services\r\nare considered to be the Military, the Naval and the Diplomatic.\r\n\r\n“Let us begin with the Military. In spite of the numerous martial races\r\nwho inhabit India in millions, no Indian can rise above the\r\nnon-commissioned ranks. We can not hope to gain a higher position than\r\nthat of a Subadar-Major or a Risaldar-Major. Every position that would\r\ngive us an independent command is closed to us. The regular army is\r\nlimited in number, no volunteers are taken from our ranks and the\r\ngeneral population is rigorously disarmed. The Arms Act perpetuates\r\ninvidious distinctions on grounds of colour and creed--distinctions most\r\nhumiliating to the people of the country. Going about their ordinary\r\ndaily occupations our people may be attacked by dacoits and evilly\r\ndisposed persons or even by wild beasts, but they can not defend\r\nthemselves. Even _lathis_[24] have been held by some judicial\r\nauthorities to be dangerous weapons. Newspapers and official communiques\r\ntell us that ordinary Naiks of our Indian Army have on the battlefield\r\nconducted themselves most bravely and have led their companies with\r\nconspicuous gallantry and ability at times when all the English officers\r\nwere either killed or disabled. If our men are capable of such\r\ninitiative and valiant deeds on the actual field of battle, why, Indians\r\nnaturally ask, should they not be trusted in the piping times of peace?\r\nHad they only been trained and allowed to serve, millions and millions\r\nwould have sprung to the side of England at her slightest call in this,\r\nthe hour of her need. Indeed, no other nation of the world has such an\r\ninexhaustible source of strength as Great Britain has in the teeming\r\nmasses of India, but India has been so maimed and crippled in her\r\nmanhood that she can help neither herself nor Great Britain. The idea is\r\ngalling and humiliating that, if a time came when India was in danger,\r\nher own sons would not be able to save their hearths and homes, or the\r\nhonour and lives of their wives and children, but would have to look to\r\nforeign nations like Japan and Russia for help and succour. Peace and\r\norder are the first requisites of a settled government and without them\r\nthere would be mere chaos; but unlimited and long-continued peace has a\r\ntendency to enervate and emasculate people. To make a living nation,\r\nhigher qualities are required. A spirit which will not bow before any\r\nadverse wind, an internal strength which will bear all toils and\r\ntroubles, a determination which will flinch from no task, however\r\nimpossible it may appear, a discipline which will love and be happy in\r\nthe service of the country and the Empire, are qualities necessary for\r\nthe attainment of that life which I call a full life. These moral forces\r\ncan only come into play when people are free and unrestricted in the\r\nexercise of all their faculties. The profession of arms is perhaps one\r\nwhich breeds this spirit and brings out these potential forces more than\r\nany other. To close it to any portion of humanity is to turn them into\r\nlifeless machines.\r\n\r\n“In the Navy, we cannot rise above the rank of a lascar. Attempts are\r\noften made to keep us out even of this lowly position. India has a vast\r\nseaboard, peopled by seafaring nations. To refuse them their birthright\r\nis to waste so much good material which would have gone to increase the\r\nstrength of the Empire. Why not have a few Indian dreadnaughts and\r\ncruisers manned by Indians and commanded by their own countrymen? It is\r\nsaid that the Indians are not fit for the Navy. Having not trained and\r\ntried them, it is not just or fair to say so. Try them first and, if\r\nfound wanting, then you have a right to reject them. The history of\r\nancient India proves that naval capacity is here; but it lies dormant\r\nfor want of sufficient opportunity.\r\n\r\n“Now I pass on to the Diplomatic Service. Here we are conspicuous by our\r\nentire absence from it. What prevents the Government from utilising the\r\nintellect, the ability and the energy of our people in this direction, I\r\nfail to understand. Why should not some of the numerous posts of\r\nPolitical Residents and Agents of India be opened to them?\r\n\r\n“In India, the Civil Service is considered to be the premier public\r\nservice of the country. Here, too, we are circumscribed and hedged in by\r\nrules and regulations which make it for our people, if not altogether\r\nimpossible, at least very difficult to enter. The examination which is\r\nthe only possible way of entry for an Indian is held in London, 7,000\r\nmiles away from his home. Those educated youths who can not bear the\r\ncost and expenses of such a journey, are entirely debarred from it,\r\nhowever brilliant they may be. The fortunate few, who can afford to\r\ncompete with Englishmen, have to do so in a language absolutely foreign\r\nto them. Why the examinations should not be held both in England and\r\nIndia to give the youths of both countries equal chances is an anomaly\r\nwhich passes my comprehension. For a number of years the country has\r\nbeen loudly demanding this much delayed justice, but instead, we get the\r\nrecent Indian Civil Service Act which has entirely abolished the\r\ncompetitive system. No doubt the operation of the Act is temporary, but\r\na wrong precedent has been created, and no one knows to what further\r\ndevelopments it will lead.\r\n\r\n“In the minor services of the country, such as Police, Forest,\r\nEducation, the higher places have been reserved for Europeans and the\r\nchildren of the soil have been told that the doors have been shut\r\nagainst them. One would have expected that at least in these minor\r\nplaces Indians would not have failed, but all our protests and\r\nentreaties have been of no avail so far.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, I pass on now to the economical development of the country.\r\nLet us see what progress we have made in this direction. Admittedly\r\nIndia is an agricultural country and its real life and strength is in\r\nthe teeming millions of humanity who live in the villages, principally\r\nby agriculture. Has anything really been done to raise them from their\r\npoverty-ridden and helpless condition? In spite of the jugglery of\r\nfigures in which the hearts of statisticians delight, what is the state\r\nof the country and its peasantry? Statistics are supposed to prove every\r\ntheory advanced by men anxious to prove their case, but our eyes are\r\nour best witnesses and can not deceive us. India is a country rich in\r\nnatural resources--resources which are not inferior to any other country\r\nin this wide, wide world. Her land bears every variety of crops from\r\ncotton and jute to wheat and mustard. Her mines produce every kind of\r\nmetal from gold and iron ores down to the best coal, and not excluding\r\nnumerous precious stones. She has a climate ranging from the bitterest\r\ncold to the intensest heat. Her rivers and forests are full of life and\r\nmaterials useful to man. In short, India is a self-contained, miniature\r\nworld. In such a country what is the condition of her inhabitants? No\r\ntoil or trouble is spared for the cultivation of their fields by the\r\nwretched and over-worked peasantry. All that manual labour can do is\r\ndone, but because of the want of scientific methods and other causes\r\nbeyond their control, the profits which ought to have been theirs are\r\nlost to them. Side by side with green, minutely and industriously\r\ncultivated fields, we find tiny and dilapidated mud hovels thatched with\r\nold and rotten straw. In these hovels there are neither windows nor\r\nfloor-cloths, and the only furniture that they boast of is a few earthen\r\nvessels and perhaps a _chatai_.[25] Human beings and cattle herd\r\ntogether with no arrangements for sanitation. Such are the conditions in\r\nwhich the great majority of our people pass their miserable existence.\r\n\r\n“In commerce and industry we are no better off. Our old indigenous\r\nindustries have been killed by foreign competition and new attempts are\r\ncrippled in the interests of other peoples than those of India. The\r\ninstance of the cotton excise duties is before us--duties which have\r\nbeen imposed in the interests of Manchester and Lancashire.\r\n\r\n“I now pass on to two of the recent repressive measures, the Press Act\r\nand the Defence of India Act. These acts have worked harshly and told\r\nheavily upon the persons and the properties of some leaders of our\r\ncommunity. Musalmans are intensely agitated, and I should be grossly\r\nnegligent in the discharge of my duties as the spokesman of Muslim\r\nIndia, if I failed to give voice to their feelings on the subject. On\r\nprinciple and by sentiment I object to repression and coercion, be it\r\nfrom the Government or from any section of a disaffected people.\r\n\r\n“I remember well, how and under what conditions the Press Act was\r\npassed. The members of the Imperial Council gave their consent to the\r\npassing of the bill on the express understanding that the law was\r\nintended for the anarchists and would never be applied in the case of\r\npeaceful citizens anxious to enlighten Government officers as to the\r\nsentiments and feeling of the people. But what is the result? _All the\r\nindependent Muslim papers have either been wiped out or are dragging on\r\na lifeless and miserable existence._[26] The _Comrade_ is gone, _The\r\nHamdard_ has been strangled to death, the _Muslim Gazette_ ceased to\r\nexist long ago, _Al-Hilal_ is no more, the _Zamindar_ is carrying on its\r\ncolourless existence with a sword of Damocles always hanging over its\r\nhead. Whoever thought that the Press Act would be applied in this\r\nfashion? Is it possible for the people not to resent such treatment and\r\nare their feelings to be treated so lightly?”\r\n\r\nThe reader will notice that there is nothing in this book which is in\r\nany way stronger either in language or in sentiments than what the\r\nPresident of the All-India Muslim League has said in the quotations\r\ngiven above. Along with these expressions of discontent are also found\r\nin his address very strong declarations of loyalty to the Government and\r\nof appreciation of what they have done for India. The task of appraising\r\nthe exact value of both kinds of statements may better be left to the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nThis is the dawn of a new day in India which the British will have to\r\nreckon with. We know that they are very skilful in _divide et impera_,\r\nbut the Indian people are now awake and that policy may not succeed so\r\nwell in the future as it has in the past.\r\n\r\nThe Indians have no desire to do anything which might in any way injure\r\nor harm the position of Great Britain as a world power. They would much\r\nrather gain Home Rule in India by peaceful means and remain a part of\r\nthe British Empire than subvert British authority in India by force or\r\nseek the assistance of any other foreign power to gain their end. But in\r\ncase the British continue to trample upon their rights and to humiliate\r\nthem and to exploit them as they have done in the past, then there is no\r\nknowing what they might not be tempted or forced to do. What is clear\r\nis this, that the number of such Indians is growing larger and larger\r\nevery day who are willing and ready to sacrifice their careers, their\r\nprospects, their happiness and their life at the altar of what they\r\nconsider to be their duty to their country.\r\n\r\nThere are others who think that their patience has been well nigh\r\nexhausted; who can not wait and would strike for their liberty at once,\r\nsaying “Our trust is in God.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this introductory part of my study of the Nationalist\r\nMovement in India, I desire to tender my heartfelt thanks to Professor\r\nA. U. Pope, of the University of California, for the encouragement and\r\nadvice he has given me in the preparation of this book, and to Dr. J. T.\r\nSunderland, of New York, for having read my manuscript and written a\r\nForeword for me.\r\n\r\nThe reader will, I hope, excuse me for certain repetitions. They are\r\nunavoidable in a book of this kind, where it is desirable to show that\r\nthe different communities and classes of the Indian population think on\r\nthe same lines in national affairs.\r\n\r\nLastly, I have to beg the pardon of the reader for certain personal\r\nreferences which may seem to be self-laudatory. I have indulged in this\r\nweakness only when it was absolutely necessary for the continuance of\r\nthe thread of the narrative. In one chapter I have retained the third\r\nperson singular so as to avoid being understood that I was speaking of\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nI am also conscious of the meagreness of certain chapters. The book is\r\ntoo short to be called a History of the National Movement. It is written\r\nmore with the object of drawing the attention of the civilised world to\r\nwhat is happening in India, than to prepare a complete record of the\r\nmovement. The foreign reader can not be expected to be interested in\r\ndetails. Moreover, he may never read a long and expensive book. Hence\r\nthe studied brevity kept in view all through. Nor do I propose to\r\ndiscuss the fitness of Indians for immediate self-government as that\r\nwould largely add to the bulk of the book, but for a brief and able\r\ndiscussion of the matter I may refer the reader to an article by the\r\nEditor in the _Modern Review_ of Calcutta for February, 1916.\r\n\r\nThen again it is to be regretted that the illustrations are so few. I\r\nwould have liked to add many more. Many prominent Nationalists find no\r\nplace for the simple reason that at the time of sending the book to the\r\npress I have not been able to get their pictures. Originally there was\r\nno idea of having any illustrations. It is too late now to delay the\r\npublication of the book pending the receipt of pictures from India.\r\nIndeed the mail facilities, just now, are so dubious that one can not be\r\ncertain of getting them at all so long as the war lasts.\r\n\r\nLAJPAT RAI.\r\n\r\nBerkeley, California, U. S.

Much of it is still enveloped in mystery. What little is known has\r\nbeen discovered and put in shape within the last hundred years. The\r\nmaterials, from which the early History of India has been prepared, have\r\nlong been in existence, but little of them were known to the Western\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIt can not be said that a complete history of Ancient India has been\r\nfully and finally constructed. What is known has been discovered bit by\r\nbit. Much yet remains to be found and put in order. It is quite unsafe,\r\ntherefore, to dogmatise about the deficiencies of Ancient Indian\r\ncivilisation. Yet this much can be said with certainty, that centuries\r\nbefore the birth of Christ India possessed a marvellous civilisation, a\r\nwonderful literature, a well organised social system, a conception of\r\ngovernment based on law and on the legal rights of subjects _inter se_,\r\nas well as against the ruling monarch.[27]\r\n\r\nWe have, besides, ample evidences in the ancient literature of India, as\r\ntranslated and interpreted by Western scholars, to the effect that\r\ndemocratic institutions were not unknown to Ancient India.[28] Nor can\r\nit be said that the idea of universal sovereignty over the whole of\r\nIndia under one permanent power was unknown to the Hindus. How often it\r\nwas realised and for how long, can not be said with any certainty.[29]\r\n\r\n_First Invasion of India_. The first political and military invasion of\r\nIndia known to history was that of Alexander the Great in 326 B. C.\r\nAlexander was no doubt victorious up to a certain point, but he never\r\nconquered India, nor did he occupy it. He did not reach even so far into\r\nthe interior as Delhi on the Jumna. He is said to have left behind him\r\nsome officers to administer the affairs of the conquered province, but\r\nit is a well established historical fact that in the conflict between\r\nChandra Gupta, the Hindu, and Seleucus, the Greek, who was the chief\r\nruling authority in Babylon after the death of Alexander, Seleucus was\r\npractically worsted and a peace was concluded by which the independence\r\nof India was fully realised. Chandra Gupta ruled over the whole of India\r\nnorth of Vindhyachal. Bengal as far east as Assam, and the Punjab as\r\nfar west as Afghanistan, were among his provinces. Fortunately for us,\r\nwe have enough independent testimony in the writings of Megasthenes, the\r\nGreek Ambassador at the court of Chandra Gupta, and other\r\ncontemporaneous Greek writers, as to the state of India at that time.\r\n\r\n_Chandra Gupta and Asoka._ Megasthenes’ account of the Government of\r\nChandra Gupta and of the details of the administration under him, is\r\nenough to fill every Indian with pride. Chandra Gupta’s organisation[30]\r\nincluded almost every form of governmental activity known to modern\r\nEurope. There was a separate department of labour under him, a separate\r\nregistrar of births, deaths and marriages, a minister who looked after\r\npublic charities, another in charge of trade and commerce, one in charge\r\nof agriculture, and so on. He had a great army, a currency and a navy.\r\nEven then the system of commercial papers was well known to Indians, who\r\nhad a great name for honesty and truthfulness. Their word was better\r\nthan a bond. Chandra Gupta was followed by Asoka, perhaps the greatest\r\nand noblest Emperor India has had during the historical period. Under\r\nhim the whole country was consolidated under one imperial sway. He ruled\r\nnot by force, but by love. His love extended even to animals. He is\r\nknown to have organised hospitals for the treatment of animals. All this\r\nhappened before Christ was born. Between 326 B. C. and the middle of\r\nthe eighth century A. D., India knew no foreign masters, in the sense\r\nthat it was never ruled for any length of time from without. A few of\r\nthe nomadic tribes of Central Asia did penetrate into India, only to be\r\nabsorbed and assimilated by the mass of the Aryans already settled and\r\nin power there.\r\n\r\nThe next foreign invasion of India, which was to leave a permanent mark\r\non the history and institutions of India and with which starts an\r\naltogether separate epoch in Indian history, was by Abul Qasim in the\r\nmiddle of the eighth century. For full 400 years the Mohammedans knocked\r\nat the door of India before they could establish a kingdom there. The\r\nfirst Mohammedan King of Delhi was Kutb-ud-din Aibak, who established a\r\ndynasty in 1206 A. D. The Mohammedans were in possession of some parts\r\nof Sindh and the Punjab between the eighth and the twelfth centuries,\r\nbut India was not conquered nor the Hindus beaten until Prithvi Raj, the\r\nlast Rajput King of Delhi, was defeated by the treachery of a brother\r\nRajput chief in the year 1193 A. D.\r\n\r\n_India Practically Independent up to the Twelfth Century._ It will be\r\nthus seen that India was practically independent up to the beginning of\r\nthe thirteenth century A. D. By independent, I mean that no foreign rule\r\nhad been imposed upon it from without. Some parts of the northwestern\r\nprovinces of the Punjab and Sindh had been for some time under Muslim\r\ndomination, but the main territory was under native rulers and native\r\nlaws. As said before, the tribes that overran the northwestern parts of\r\nIndia between the invasion of Alexander the Great and that of Abul\r\nQasim, came to settle. Once settled there, they adopted the religion and\r\nthe social life of the country and were merged with the natives.\r\nThenceforth there was no distinction between them and the other Indian\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n_Muslim Rule._ The Mohammedan rule over India lasted for six centuries\r\nwith varying vicissitudes of fortune. For three centuries, from the\r\nthirteenth to the beginning of the sixteenth century, their rule was\r\npractically confined to Northern India. Deccan, Rajputana and Central\r\nIndia were always more or less independent until Akbar consolidated the\r\nwhole country under his flag; though even he failed to vanquish Partap,\r\nthe invincible Rana of Udeypore (Rajputana).[31] Partap was defeated,\r\nwas driven out of his capital, was pursued and harassed, but he did not\r\nmake his submission to the Mogul. Akbar won over to his side almost all\r\nthe other Rajput chiefs, some by his prowess, others by friendship, but\r\nthe Sessodia[32] chief would not bend his knee. His countrymen simply\r\nworshipped him. So strong was the feeling of patriotism and the love of\r\nindependence among the Hindus, even then, that when Akbar one day\r\nannounced in the Durbar that he had received a petition of submission\r\nfrom Partap, the Rajputs present in the Durbar refused to believe him.\r\nIt is well known how one of them, Prithvi Raj, a poet, wrote to Partap\r\nof the indescribable grief the report had caused them, and telling him\r\nthat the Hindu sun would set forever if Partap would yield; and how he\r\nreceived an answer that the report was wrong and that Partap would never\r\nyield and would keep the flag flying. That shows how a Hindu servant of\r\nAkbar, who had made his submission and accepted the service of the\r\nMogul, felt in the matter. Although beaten himself, he would not\r\nacknowledge that the Hindus had been finally beaten so long as Partap\r\nwas resisting the Mogul arms. It speaks very highly of the\r\nbroad-mindedness of Akbar that, so far back as the sixteenth century, he\r\nallowed one of his Hindu captives and servants to speak out so boldly\r\nand plainly of his love of Hindu independence. Akbar, we must remember,\r\nhad succeeded in making alliances with almost all the other important\r\nRajput houses. The proud Rahtores[33] had given him a daughter for a\r\nbride, and the _Kutchwahas_,[33] Bikanir[33] and Boondi[33] had also\r\nsubmitted. So Partap had to fight the combined forces of Akbar and his\r\nown brother-Rajput chiefs, some of whom were related to him by the\r\ndearest ties of blood and marriage. Yet single-handed, for a quarter of\r\na century, did he withstand the efforts of the mighty empire over which\r\nAkbar ruled to force his submission. In the words of Colonel Tod, it is\r\nworthy “the attention of those who influence the destinies of states in\r\nmore favoured climes to estimate the intensity of feeling which could\r\narm Partap to oppose the resources of a small principality against the\r\nthen most powerful empire in the world, whose armies were more numerous\r\nand far more efficient than any ever led by the Persians against the\r\nliberties of Greece.”\r\n\r\nOn his deathbed Partap made his successor swear to eternal conflict\r\nagainst “the foes of his country’s independence.” This was in the\r\nsixteenth century, four hundred years after the first Muslim king had\r\nascended the throne of Delhi. But a hundred years had hardly gone by\r\nafter the event when the Hindus again questioned Muslim supremacy. The\r\nSikhs in the Punjab, the Rajputs in Central India, and the Mahrattas in\r\nthe Deccan, had started their campaigns before Aurangzeb died in 1707 A.\r\nD. The Muslim supremacy was destroyed by the Hindus and not by the\r\nBritish.\r\n\r\n_Muslim Rule in India not Foreign._ Yet it is not right to say that the\r\nMuslim rule in India was a “foreign rule.” The Muslim invaders were no\r\ndoubt foreign in their origin, just as the Normans and Danes were when\r\nthey came to England, but as soon as they settled in India, adopted the\r\ncountry, made it their home, married and raised children there, they\r\nbecame the sons of the soil. Akbar and Aurangzeb were as much Indians as\r\nare to-day the Moguls and Pathans in Delhi or elsewhere. Sher Shah and\r\nIbrahim Lodi were no more foreigners in India than were the descendants\r\nof William the Conqueror or the successors of William of Orange in Great\r\nBritain. When Timur and Nadir Shah and Ahmad Shah Abdali attacked India,\r\nthey attacked a kingdom which was ruled by Indian Muslims. They were as\r\nmuch the enemies of the Mohammedan rulers of India as of the Hindus.\r\n\r\nThe Muslims, who exercised political sovereignty in India from the\r\nthirteenth up to the middle of the nineteenth century A. D., were\r\nIndians by birth, Indians by marriage, and Indians by death. They were\r\nborn in India, they married there, there they died, and there they were\r\nburied. Every penny of the revenues they raised in India was spent in\r\nIndia. Their army was wholly Indian. They allowed new families from\r\nbeyond the borders of Hindustan to come and settle in India, but they\r\nvery rarely, if at all, employed people who were not willing to stay in\r\nIndia for good and to make it their home. Their bias, if any, against\r\nthe Hindus was religious, not political. The converts to Islam were\r\nsometimes treated even with greater consideration than the original\r\nMuslims. Akbar, of course, did away with that distinction, but even the\r\nmost bigoted and the most orthodox Mohammedan ruler of India was not\r\npossessed of that kind of social pride and social exclusiveness which\r\ndistinguishes the British ruler of India to-day. If the racial question\r\never came into prominence during Mohammedan supremacy in India, it was\r\nnot between Hindus and Mohammedans, but between Mohammedans and\r\nMohammedans, as for instance between _Tuglaks_ and _Pathans_, or between\r\n_Moguls_ and _Lodis_.[34]\r\n\r\nIn the reign of rulers like Sher Shah, Akbar, Jehangir, and Shah Jahan,\r\nthe Hindus were eligible for the highest offices under the crown next\r\nafter the princes of royal blood. They were governors of provinces,\r\ngenerals of armies, and rulers of districts and divisions. In short, the\r\ndistinctions between the Hindus and Muslims were neither political nor\r\nsocial. Looked at from the political and the economic point of view, the\r\nGovernment was as much indigenous as under Hindu rule. The Muslims never\r\nattempted to disarm the population; nor did they prohibit the\r\nmanufacture or import of arms. They did not recruit their servants from\r\nArabia, or Persia, or Afghanistan. They had no Lancashire industries to\r\nprotect, and were under no necessity of imposing excise duties on\r\nIndian-made goods. They brought their own language and literature with\r\nthem. For a time, perhaps, they transacted all government business\r\nthrough that language, but eventually they evolved a language which is\r\nas much Indian as any other vernacular spoken in India to-day. The\r\ngroundwork of this language, which is now called Urdu or Hindustani, is\r\npurely Indian. The Muslim rulers of India had no anxiety for, and were\r\nin no way concerned with, the prosperity of the labouring classes of\r\nPersia or Afghanistan. If any one sought their patronage, he had to come\r\nto and settle in India. So their government was an Indian government\r\nand not a foreign government.\r\n\r\nHistory does not record a single instance of India being ruled from\r\nwithout, by a people of purely non-Indian blood and in the interests of\r\nanother country and another people, before the British.[35] India was\r\nalways an empire by herself. She was never a part of another empire,\r\nmuch less a dependency. She had her own army, her own navy, her own\r\nflag. Her revenues were spent for her own benefit. She had her\r\nindustries and manufactured the goods she consumed. Any one wanting the\r\nprivilege of trading with India under special terms had to obtain the\r\nsanction of her government, as the East India Company did. There was no\r\nIndia Office in Arabia or in Persia or in Kabul, to which the people of\r\nIndia looked for initiative in the affairs of their native land.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIA UNDER THE BRITISH\r\n\r\nIndia under the British is, however, entirely different.[36] For the\r\nfirst time in history she becomes a part of another empire. India\r\nto-day is not an empire by herself, but a part of the British Empire, as\r\nBritain once was a part of the Roman Empire. For the first time in\r\nhistory she has been reduced to the position of a dependency. For the\r\nfirst time in her history she is ruled from the outside. For the first\r\ntime the Indians have been reduced to the position of a subject people,\r\ngoverned by an alien race residing in a different and far-off country.\r\nFor the first time she is ruled by a sovereign who does not live in\r\nIndia, who sends out every five years a viceroy to administer the\r\naffairs of the country under the authority of a minister in a foreign\r\nland. For the first time her affairs are managed by people who come and\r\ngo, under laws made outside of India.[37] All the chief offices of\r\nstate, the direction and control of armies, the administration of\r\nrevenues, of divisions, of districts, the coining of money, the\r\nadministration of justice, the imposing of taxes, etc., are generally in\r\nthe hands of foreigners who have absolutely no interest in the country\r\nexcept as servants of the crown, persons whose interests in the country\r\ncease with the expiration of their term of service. These servants are\r\nrecruited and appointed out of India. Indians as such are virtually\r\nineligible for many of these offices. During the 150 years of British\r\nrule in India, no Indian has been appointed to the governorship of any\r\nprovince. Indians are ineligible for commissions in the army; they\r\ncannot be enrolled as volunteers. In order to qualify for the Civil\r\nservice of their own country, they have to travel six thousand miles, to\r\ntake the chance of succeeding once in a while.\r\n\r\n_Political Disqualification of the Indians._ For the first time in the\r\npolitical history of India it has become a political disqualification to\r\nbe an Indian. The offspring of an Englishman, domiciled in India and\r\nmarried to an Indian lady, loses in rank and status by that fact; nor\r\ndoes the issue of an Indian gentleman from an Englishwoman gain anything\r\nthereby. So the inferiority in both ways lies in Indian blood and Indian\r\norigin. The Muslim who married in India, or the Indian who married a\r\nPersian or Afghan, were not affected thereby in their political\r\nprivileges in the Mohammedan régime. An Indian convert to Christianity\r\nis in no better position in India than a Hindu or a Muslim. Thus it is\r\nnot a religious inferiority or a religious distinction, upon which the\r\npolitical disabilities of an Indian are based, but the fact of his being\r\nan Indian by blood and by birth. Never before was India governed by a\r\nhandful of officers, military and civil, who came to rule for a period,\r\ngoing away when that period was over, only to be replaced by another set\r\nequally temporary. India thus loses all or most of what these receive in\r\nthe shape of money; she loses all the experience which they gain in the\r\ndifferent spheres of activity that engages them during the period of\r\ntheir service in India; last but not least, she is deprived of the\r\nsatisfaction and pride of claiming these men as her sons, who would in\r\ntheir turn take pride in her and feel as sons should for their mother.\r\nThey come as her rulers, and till the end remain the same. Their sons\r\nand grandsons also may in their turn come as rulers, but never as sons.\r\nThe sons of India, who gain the rank of officials, are only servants of\r\nthe British. Their position in the Indian services is generally that of\r\ndrawers of water and hewers of wood for their British masters.\r\n\r\n_All Europeans, Eurasians including Armenians and Jews can carry arms\r\nfree of license; not so the Indians._ In India, the Indians only are\r\nforbidden to carry arms except by special permission of their masters;\r\nand permission is of course granted very sparingly and as a matter of\r\nfavour, as a special concession and not as a right. The highest, the\r\nnoblest, and the purest among the Indians has to be _excepted_ from the\r\noperation of the Arms Act, as an act of mercy on the part of his foreign\r\nrulers. In the hills of his own native country, where his parents,\r\ngrandparents, and great grandparents before him were born, where they\r\nperhaps ruled or held positions of trust, where they died, where they\r\nfertilised the soil with their blood, and where within less than a\r\ncentury they enjoyed absolute freedom, he, their immediate descendant,\r\nmust not carry an umbrella over his head to give him shelter from rain\r\nor sun without the risk of being kicked to death or being insulted by\r\nthe lowest among the foreign masters of his country.[38] The hoary\r\nHimalayas, the beloved abode of his most respected divinities, are in\r\nsome places virtually shut against him because the “white gods” have\r\ndeveloped a fancy for them.\r\n\r\nBut that is not all. Even outside India he carries the badge of\r\npolitical subjection with him. The British colonies, more than any other\r\ncountry, bang their doors on him. He is a pariah all over the world.\r\nConsidering that this is his position in his home, he could hardly be\r\nanything else outside. The British Government does not like his going\r\nabroad except as an indentured coolie to the British colonies. He may go\r\nto England on a pleasure trip, but they do not want Indians there in any\r\nnumbers. They particularly dislike his going to America and settling\r\nthere. The reason is obvious. Travelling abroad gives him opportunities\r\nof comparing British rule in India with the forms of government\r\nprevailing in other countries. Free atmosphere and free environment\r\nraise aspirations which are dangerous, at any rate inconvenient to\r\nBritish supremacy in India. Moreover, they effectively break down the\r\nhypnotism which has so far enthralled the Indian mind in its judgments\r\nregarding British character. On his return to India, a travelled Indian\r\nbecomes a centre of discontent. In the course of their travels some\r\nIndians meet the free-thinkers and revolutionaries of Europe and learn\r\ntheir methods. All this is naturally disliked by the British.\r\n\r\nTherefore, of late, the British have been taking steps to discourage\r\nforeign travelling on the part of Indians. They have been trying to keep\r\nIndian students out of Great Britain by imposing conditions which are\r\nrepellent. They have raised the educational standards which had formerly\r\nsecured them admission into British universities and British Inns of\r\nCourt. They have organised an official bureau in London which,\r\nostensibly acting as their guardian and adviser, discourages them from\r\nentering British universities, keeps a vigilant eye on their movements,\r\nreports on their conduct to the authorities at home, and insists upon\r\ntheir seeking admission to British educational institutions through\r\nit.[39] At all Indian ports there are police officers present, who note\r\ndown the names of, and particulars relating to, every Indian who leaves\r\nIndian shores. Thenceforth two eyes are almost always watching him, go\r\nwherever he may.\r\n\r\nTo him, the British embassies in the different countries of the world\r\nmean nothing. He is afraid of seeking their help, first for fear of\r\ngetting a rebuff and being insulted, second because he is afraid of\r\ncircumstances being created which might force his early departure from\r\nthat country. His wrongs are nobody’s wrongs. He may be assaulted, nay,\r\neven killed, or insulted, or robbed, or ill-treated, yet he has no\r\ngovernment to look to his interests. The British Government does not\r\nresent other countries’ excluding him; they are rather happy at it and\r\nin some cases are understood to have exercised their influence against\r\nhis entry into foreign countries. The self-governing dominions of the\r\nBritish Empire have built a solid wall of most revolting and inhuman\r\nlaws and regulations against his entry into those dominions. He cannot\r\ngo there, even on a pleasure trip or for study, except by submitting to\r\nimpossible tests or most revolting conditions.\r\n\r\nIn this respect he is much better treated by non-British countries. Till\r\nrecently he could come and go there quite freely. No European country\r\nbars his visits. Of late the United States, it is said, at the instance\r\nof the British Government, has been following a policy of exclusion. But\r\nonce in the country, all universities and institutions receive him,\r\nprovided he fulfils their conditions and complies with their\r\nregulations. That much, however, cannot be said of Great Britain. It is\r\ntrue that Great Britain imposes no restrictions on his coming and going,\r\nas she imposes no restrictions on any one else’s coming and going, but\r\nthere are British institutions which would not admit him as a student,\r\nhowever high his social position or status may be. Even those\r\ninstitutions which admit him for study, discriminate against him in the\r\nmatter of military drill. They would not admit him into their volunteer\r\ncorps; nor would they take him as a boy scout. A great many of the\r\nBritish clubs would have nothing to do with him. The only British club\r\nof note, which has a fairly good number of Indians on its rolls and\r\nwhich accords them a welcome, is the National Liberal Club. This club is\r\na noble exception.\r\n\r\nNow the British must be an extremely unimaginative people, if they think\r\nthat all this does not make the Indian feel the inferiority of his\r\nposition. The latter, naturally, ascribes all this to the fact of his\r\ncountry’s having no national government of her own to protect him and to\r\nadvance his interests. All this reminds him most forcibly of the fact\r\nthat he belongs to a subject race, that his country does not count in\r\nthe world because she is not free and has no embassies, that she has no\r\nflag of her own, nor consular representatives to back her sons, and that\r\nin the great mass of civilised humanity he is a mere cypher. All this\r\nnaturally tells on his nerves and he becomes an extremist. He feels that\r\nanything would be preferable to this life of shame and dishonor.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for people who have never been placed in a similar\r\nposition to realise the sense of humiliation and shame involved in this\r\ncondition of things. Let the British for a moment imagine themselves\r\nunder similar circumstances, and they may then be in a position to\r\nappreciate the point of view of an Indian nationalist. Let us suppose\r\nfor a moment that the Germans conquer England and impose their rule on\r\nthe British race. How would the British like their country being\r\nadministered by a viceroy of the Kaiser selected by the German\r\nChancellor, with the help of a council consisting of Germans and of a\r\nbureaucracy recruited almost exclusively from Prussia, with only a\r\nsprinkling of native Britishers? No one can question the efficiency of\r\nthe German system. The strong hand of Germany might keep Ireland in\r\npeace and prevent the suffragists and the socialists and the Roman\r\nCatholics disturbing public tranquillity. They might even employ a whole\r\narmy of Britishers in the subordinate posts, might pay them handsomely\r\nfor military and police duty, might confer decorations and titles on\r\nthem, might build even greater engineering works for them than they had\r\never done, and might let them retain their language for elementary\r\neducation or for religious or domestic purposes. Would the English be\r\nsatisfied and would they be contented? Would they consider German rule\r\nto be a blessing and judge it by trade returns? Never![40] Why then,\r\nshould they question the patriotism or good sense of the Indians who\r\nwant self-government for India? Did not Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman say\r\nthat good government could never be a substitute for self-government?\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that it is impossible for a free-born citizen of a free\r\ncountry to put himself in the position of a political subject and\r\nrealise fully and properly the sense of humiliation and shame involved\r\ntherein. The feeling is unknown to him, and he has not sufficient\r\nimagination to place himself in that position. Why cannot a Britisher\r\nsee that every Indian, visiting foreign countries, has to hang his head\r\nin shame?\r\n\r\nBritish statesmen, politicians, publicists and journalists all talk of\r\nthe blessings of British rule in India, of what the British have done\r\nthere in establishing peace and order, in making railways and canals, in\r\nimparting education, in stimulating trade, in administering impartial\r\njustice, in fostering industries, in organising the postal and the\r\ntelegraph systems, and in opening the country to the world. They cannot\r\nsee why the Indian should wish to get rid of the British. The British\r\nhave done so much for him, have brought civilisation to his door, have\r\nraised him from “obscurity,” have given him their language and their\r\ninstitutions, have opened to him the gates of knowledge, have provided\r\nfor him security from both domestic and foreign dangers, and have put\r\nhim on the road to ever-increasing prosperity and “_happiness_.” Let us\r\nassume for the moment that all this is wholly true, but can it\r\ncompensate for the loss of manhood which is involved in political\r\nbondage? Chains are chains, no matter if gilded. Can the wealth of the\r\nwhole world be put in the scales over against liberty and honour? What\r\nwould it avail if one were to get the sovereignty of the world but lose\r\nhis own soul? A subject people has no soul, just as a slave can have\r\nnone. Subjects and slaves are not even the masters of their bodies.\r\n\r\nAn Indian leader, a high-class Bengali lawyer, who is now one of His\r\nMajesty’s judges in the High Court of Calcutta, once said, while\r\npresiding over a conference in Bengal before he became a judge, that a\r\nsubject people could have no politics. A people who have no politics\r\nhave no soul. A man without a soul is a mere animal. A nation without a\r\nsoul is only a herd of “dumb driven cattle,” and such are the Indians of\r\nthe present day. It is a base calumny, and a mean falsehood to say in\r\nreply, that they have been so from time immemorial, that they have\r\nnever been free, that they have never cared who ruled over them, that\r\nthey have never been patriotic, or that patriotism and a feeling of\r\nnationality are new growths due to contact with the West, and that the\r\nIndian people do not sympathise with the aspirations of the\r\nnationalists. Of course, there are some people in India, as elsewhere,\r\nwho, through rolling in wealth, living in purple, inheriting long\r\npedigrees, carrying high titles, bearing proud names, seem to be happy\r\nand contented under the existing conditions. For them, the security from\r\nmolestation they have, the freedom of enjoyment they possess, the\r\ncomforts and luxuries which they command, the pleasure which is born of\r\ninactive, lazy, parasitic, debauched lives, is all in all. Any change\r\nmay bring all this edifice down; it may spell ruin to them and their\r\nchildren. The immunity from work, which they at present enjoy, may all\r\ndisappear by a change of political conditions. The British Government\r\nhas guaranteed them not only their possessions, but also their right to\r\nlive and thrive on the ignorance, the superstitions, and the mental and\r\nmoral slavery of their followers and subjects.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the Nabobs and Maharajas of India. Many of them might\r\nhave to cut stones and make roads to earn their living, if they were not\r\nprotected by British bayonets. Their harems consisting of numerous\r\ninnocent women doomed to life-long imprisonment, to lives of barrenness\r\nand shame and emptiness, their big cellars full of the choicest and the\r\noldest of whiskies, brandies, and champagnes, their stables full of the\r\nswiftest and the noblest of race horses, their drawing rooms decorated\r\nwith gold, silver, silk and velvet, all that money can buy and art can\r\nembellish, their dining tables laden with all inviting dishes and\r\ndelicacies which the best paid _cuisine_ in the world can produce, their\r\nability to travel in special trains and gorgeous saloons, and to command\r\na new woman and a new wine every day of the year, and to move in the\r\nmost fashionable circles,--all depend on the continuance of the existing\r\nconditions. For them, this is life. They do not know what honour is. For\r\nthem, struggle, strife, duty, political change, mean a dislocation of\r\neverything dear to them. It would be practical death to them. Yes, it\r\nmay be true that such people do not care for political liberty, for\r\nfreedom, for independence, for patriotism. For them, their present life\r\nis bliss and they do not want to be molested either by the politician or\r\nby the patriot.\r\n\r\nBut their number is not large. Some of the ruling chiefs may not speak\r\nout, but in their heart of hearts many of them feel the humiliation of\r\nthe situation. A Maharana of Udeypore may not be in a position to assert\r\nhis independence and take the chance of losing his State, but even _he_\r\nmay not consent to walk behind a Curzon in a coronation procession in\r\nhonour of the King of England and the foreign Emperor of India. A\r\nGaekwar of Baroda may be powerless as against the British army and\r\nBritish navy, but even he, in a moment of exalted self-respect, may\r\nforget to make an abject obeisance to the King of England. Such men and\r\neven many of less worth and nobility, cannot put up with a Lord Curzon.\r\nIt is good for their sense of self-respect and also for the country at\r\nlarge to have a Curzon for a viceroy. It reminds them, as nothing else\r\nperhaps would, of their degradation and fall.\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to observe how the Indian Chiefs writhe and fret\r\nand foam when a Curzon threatens their privileges, tries to limit their\r\nfreedom, and otherwise trespasses upon their rights. It is then that a\r\nwave of shame sweeps over them and touches some lingering sense of\r\nself-respect and pride in their hearts. But the infamous, lazy,\r\ndebauched lives which some of them have led make it impossible for them\r\nto maintain this indignation long enough for it to goad them to any\r\nsustained effort to throw away their thraldom and assert their manhood.\r\nThe injecting of an electric current may temporarily revive a dead body,\r\nmay produce some kind of activity even in a parasite, but it cannot put\r\n_life_ into it.\r\n\r\nBut after all, as compared with the number of people who are alive to\r\nthe sense of self-respect and honour, the parasitical crowned heads or\r\npriests or noblemen (Nabobs, Rajas, and Maharajas) are only a few. They\r\nare a mere drop in the ocean, though they possess the means of keeping\r\nthemselves in the public eye and of having their trumpets blown and\r\npraises sung by the press and from the platform both in India and in\r\nEngland. The British too are interested in keeping them at the front, in\r\nparading their loyalty and devotion to the empire, and in magnifying\r\ntheir importance and greatness.\r\n\r\nThere are few among the nobility of India who command any real respect\r\neither from the educated section of their countrymen in general, or even\r\nfrom their own subjects and dependents. Of course there are noble\r\nexceptions to this statement. And yet it is true that a large number of\r\nruling chiefs are mere figureheads in their states. Their policy is\r\neither dictated or guided or controlled by the British Resident or the\r\nBritish Political Agent through his creatures or through persons, who,\r\nthough not quite his creatures, are afraid of his displeasure. In some\r\nstates, the Resident interferes in almost everything, and all the\r\ndetails of administration pass through his fingers either directly or\r\nindirectly. In others, the Resident watches the administration from a\r\ndistance and lays down the broad outlines of policy. There are few\r\nnative states, their number may be counted on one’s fingers, where the\r\nruling chief has a will or capacity to really assert himself, to stand\r\non his dignity, and to maintain his independence. Even the most\r\nenlightened and the most independent Prince is compelled to consult the\r\nwishes of the Resident and the wishes of the Government of India as\r\nexpressed by him.\r\n\r\n_Loyalty of Ruling Chiefs_. It would be quite wrong to conclude, as some\r\npeople do, that all the ruling chiefs are sincerely loyal to the British\r\nsupremacy, or that their acts displaying loyalty are free and\r\nindependent expressions of their minds or their will.[41] Some of them\r\nare devoid of any real sense of honour, or are lost to it by habitual\r\nsubmission or habitual debauchery. They are quite contented to be left\r\nalone to enjoy. There are others, however, who would be only too glad to\r\nthrow away the British yoke, if they could only see a way of\r\nsuccessfully doing so. They are not prepared to take their chances. It\r\nshould be distinctly understood, therefore, that the Nationalist Party\r\ndoes not count upon their help or sympathy. A good many perhaps\r\nsympathise with the party of violence, and chuckle at their successes,\r\nbut none of them dare do anything to help them in any shape. A few\r\nopenly sympathise with the “constitutional” party, but even they cannot\r\nand would not give them any monetary or other kind of help as it might\r\neasily be construed into an act of unfriendliness towards the Paramount\r\nPower, and might mar their relations with that.\r\n\r\nThe smaller fry, the wealthy banker, the great landlord, the Bengal\r\nZemindar, and the Oudh Talukdar, are almost completely in the hands of\r\nthe British officials. The sympathy of the British officials benefits\r\nthem materially. Their antipathy or dislike or aversion would ruin them\r\nfinancially. The British collector or magistrate holds complete sway\r\nover their souls. They would rather go out of their way to propitiate\r\nhim and win his pleasure, than risk the slightest suspicion of an\r\nindependent attitude, or of any conduct which even by stretch of\r\nimagination could be construed into independence. Yet there are some,\r\nin Bengal at least, who do sympathise with, and give active help to, the\r\nRevolutionary Party. There are others who sympathise with, and give\r\noccasional monetary assistance to, the Constitutional Party. The latter\r\nclass does not count for much in Indian politics, and anything said or\r\ndone by them cannot be said to represent the attitude of any very large\r\nsection of the Indian community.\r\n\r\nMen of wealth and men of means have nowhere led the revolutionary or the\r\npolitical movements in the history of freedom in this world of ours.\r\nTheir interests as a class are opposed to change. Sometimes there does\r\narise from among their ranks a man of courage, a man endowed with an\r\nadventurous nature or fired by ambition, who leads the movement for\r\nchange, in the hope of either establishing a dynasty, or otherwise\r\nleaving a name in history; and sometimes one comes across a wealthy man\r\nwho, out of regard for principle, and from conviction, is a patriot, and\r\njoins the patriotic party deliberately, and risks his possessions and\r\nposition; but such instances are always few and far between in all\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n_Middle Class Desires Political Freedom._ The desire for political\r\nindependence, the sense of shame and humiliation born of being a subject\r\nrace, of being a political pariah, must from the nature of things be\r\nconfined largely to the educated middle class. Even the masses could not\r\nbe expected to take a very deep interest in the movement for political\r\nindependence. Their ignorance, their illiteracy, but most of all the\r\nhard struggle they have to carry on for barest existence, prevents them\r\nfrom devoting time or thought to the question. Their time and thought\r\nare given to the fight against hunger and want, against disease and\r\ndistress, against misery and wretchedness. They are easy to please. A\r\nslight act of kindness or of charity or of consideration makes them\r\nhappy. They are easily confused on fundamental issues. This is true even\r\nin Europe and America, where the common people have received the\r\nbenefits of school education, and where they have had a training in\r\ndemocratic thought for a century or more. The masses are easily led\r\nastray by governments or by classes in league with governments. In every\r\ncountry it is the educated middle class that leads the movement for\r\npolitical independence or for political progress. It is the strength of\r\ntheir convictions, their earnestness, their capacity to suffer for their\r\nconvictions, their willingness to sacrifice themselves for principles\r\nand for truth, coupled with the extent and amount of their influence\r\nover the masses, which determines the fate of the movement for liberty.\r\n\r\nA movement of that nature never dies. “The battle of freedom once begun\r\nis carried on from father to son,” is as good to-day as it ever was. Yet\r\nthe movement may be delayed, or its issue may be confused, or the\r\ncontrary, according to the wisdom or the folly of its advocates, or the\r\namount of earnestness they put in it, or the amount of influence they\r\nhave over the masses, as well as by the wisdom or shortsightedness or\r\ncunning of those who oppose it. All the world over, progressive\r\npolitical movements have had vicissitudes of fortune, stages of\r\ndevelopment, times of reactions, defeats and reverses. Governments\r\nalways begin by ignoring such movements. Then comes a period of\r\nridicule, followed by repression. But their efforts are futile. The food\r\non which the tender plant of liberty thrives is the blood of the martyr.\r\nThe rope of the hangman, the axe of the executioner, or the shot of the\r\ngunner, extinguishes individual life, only to make the desire for\r\ncorporate life keener and stronger. Banishments, deportations,\r\nimprisonments, tortures and confiscations, are the usual weapons of the\r\ntyrant to strangle liberty, to extirpate those that are after it, but\r\nthey have so far proved ineffectual to kill it. Conciliation is\r\nsometimes more successful than repression, but conciliation delayed or\r\nconcessions forced have been proved to be worse than useless. The\r\nNationalist Movement in India has passed through some of these stages,\r\nand is passing through the rest. We presume it will be of some interest\r\nand use to trace its development, and to make a retrospective review of\r\nits successes and failures so far.[42]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nINDIA FROM 1757 TO 1857 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nAurangzeb, the 6th Mogul Emperor of India, died in 1707 A. D. Within\r\nfifty years of his death, the Mogul sovereignty in India was reduced to\r\nits last gasp. The seeds sown by his bigotry, fanaticism, and suspicious\r\nnature were ripening and bringing to his successors a harvest of\r\ndissensions and discords, of rebellions and revolts. In the North as\r\nwell as the South, forces had been generated which threatened the end of\r\nthe Mogul rule. The martyrdom of Guru Teg Bahadur, the Sikh Guru, who\r\nwas foully murdered at Delhi, where he had gone on a mission of peace,\r\nhad sunk deep into the hearts of his followers, and his son, Guru Govind\r\nSingh, was organising forces which were destined to supplant Mogul rule\r\nin the Land of the Five Rivers.[43] In the Deccan, Sivaji’s[44] standard\r\nand throne had become the rallying point of the fighting forces of\r\nSouthern India.\r\n\r\nBy 1757 A. D., the Sikhs in the Punjab and the Mahrattas in the Deccan\r\nhad succeeded in undermining the foundations of the Mogul rule, which\r\nwas now steadily disintegrating. The Nizam of Hyderabad, and the Nawab\r\nof Mysore had asserted their independence and were disputing the\r\nmastery of the Deccan with the Mahrattas. Similarly the Nabobs of Bengal\r\nand Oudh owed only nominal allegiance to the King of Delhi. The greater\r\npart of the peninsula, Central India, was under the Mahrattas.\r\n\r\n_Conflict of French and English in India._ The political fate of India\r\nwas hanging in the balance, when a power arose to take advantage of the\r\ndisturbed conditions of things. The French and the English both entered\r\nthe arena, taking different sides, and began to shuffle their cards.\r\nThey sold their help to the highest bidder, and at the conclusion of\r\nevery game, or even in the midst of it, changed partners as often as\r\nthey could in the interest of their respective masters. The first\r\nmilitary achievement of note, which gave decisive advantage to the\r\nBritish, was at the battle of Plassey in 1757. That practically gave\r\nthem the key to the sovereignty of India. From 1757 to 1857 was the\r\ncentury of struggle, both military and diplomatic. The one end kept in\r\nview was the making of the Empire and the amassing of wealth.\r\n\r\n_How British Rule in India was Established._ Hindus were played against\r\nthe Mohammedans, and vice versa, states and principalities against\r\nstates and principalities, Jats against Rajputs, and Rajputs against\r\nJats, Mahrattas against both, Rohillas against Bundelas, and Bundelas\r\nagainst Pathans, and so on. Treaties were made and broken without the\r\nleast scruple, sides were taken and changed and again changed without\r\nthe least consideration of honour or faith. Thrones were purchased and\r\nsold to the highest bidder. Military support was purchased and given\r\nlike merchandise. Servants were induced to betray their masters,\r\nsoldiers to desert flags, without any regard to the morality of the\r\nsteps taken. Pretences were invented and occasions sought for involving\r\nstates and principalities in wars and trouble. Laws of all kinds,\r\nnational and international, moral and religious, were all for the time\r\nthrown into the discard. Neither minors nor widows received any\r\nconsideration; the young and the old were treated alike. The one object\r\nin view was to loot, to plunder, and to make an empire. Everything was\r\nsubordinated to that end. One has only to read Mill and Wilson’s\r\n“History of British India,” Burke’s “Impeachment of Warren Hastings,”\r\nTorrens’ “Our Empire in Asia,” Wilson’s “Sword and Ledger,” Bell’s\r\n“Annexation of the Punjab” to find out that the above is a bare and\r\nmoderate statement of truth.\r\n\r\n_Methods of Consolidation of British India._ Policies (fiscal,\r\nindustrial, religious, educational) were all discussed and formulated\r\nfrom one point of view, viz., the establishing of British authority, the\r\nconsolidation of British rule, and pecuniary gain to the East India\r\nCompany. If one were to pile up “scraps of paper” which the British\r\ndestroyed or disregarded in the making of their Indian empire, one could\r\nfill a decent sized box therewith. The administrations of Wellesley and\r\nDalhousie alone would furnish sufficient material for the purpose. We\r\ndo not know of anything in Indian history which could be compared with\r\nthe deeds of this century. It was a century of consistent, prolonged,\r\nand deliberate spoliation, subtle and scientific sometimes, in the\r\npursuance of which all laws of morality, humanity, and fairness were\r\ntossed aside, and the object in view was persistently and doggedly kept\r\nin view and achieved. It was not the doing of this man or that man, but,\r\nwith some noble exceptions, of the whole body of Administrators sent by\r\nthe East India Company to manage their affairs in the East. The policies\r\nand doings of the various rulers that were sent from England to\r\nadminister the affairs of India differed in degree only.\r\n\r\n_British Public Ignorant of Facts._ It is true that the British people\r\nas a whole had no notion of what was going on in India. They were as\r\nignorant of it, then, as they are to-day of the doings of their\r\ncountrymen in that vast “continent.” It sufficed for them to know that\r\ntheir countrymen were carving an empire there, conquering provinces and\r\nbringing millions of alien people under British rule; as it suffices for\r\nthem to know to-day that they have an empire in India. India brought\r\nthem wealth and material prosperity. Individuals became fabulously rich\r\nand their wealth filtered downward and filled the whole British nation.\r\nThe nation became rich by the dividends of the East India Company, and\r\nby the enormous profits which British manufacturers and British traders\r\nmade by the fact of British supremacy in India. That was enough for the\r\nnation. Even when their moral sense was at times shocked by certain\r\ndisclosures, which by chance found their way into the press or into the\r\nliterature of the country, it was soon calmed and set at rest by the\r\nspeeches made by the statesmen at the helm of affairs, who explained\r\nthem away, excused their authors on political grounds, and laid down in\r\nhigh, grandiloquent terms that the general aim of British rule in India\r\nwas beneficent, and that this aim was steadily being pursued. The\r\nimpeachment of Warren Hastings by Burke should have opened the eyes of\r\nthe British public as to what was happening in India; but the eventual\r\nacquittal of that famous pro-consul set matters at rest. And Warren\r\nHastings was by no means the worst offender. What happened then is\r\nhappening every day in India, only in a different way and on a different\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nYet I am not disposed to criticise the British public. Democracies have\r\nno time for the critical examination of the affairs of other countries\r\nand other people. They have their own trouble, enough and to spare. They\r\nlook to material benefits, and their imagination is fired and their mind\r\nis thrilled by the fact of so many millions being under their rule. In\r\nthe case of the British, both combined make them proud of their\r\ncountrymen, who rule and administer India in their name. They have no\r\nreason to be critical. Human nature is human nature after all. Ordinary\r\nhuman nature is not inclined to be critical at gains, especially when it\r\ndoes not directly feel the iniquity of the methods by which those gains\r\nare made. But this is only by the way.\r\n\r\nTo continue the thread of my narrative: the history of British\r\n“conquest” of India from 1757 to 1857 A. D. is a continuous record of\r\npolitical charlatanry, political faithlessness, and political\r\nimmorality. It was a triumph of British “diplomacy.” The British\r\nfounders of the Indian empire had the true imperial instincts of\r\nempire-builders. They cared little for the means which they employed.\r\nMoral theorists cannot make empires. Empires can only be built by\r\nunscrupulous men of genius, men of daring and dash, making the best of\r\nopportunities that come to their hands, caring little for the wrongs\r\nwhich they thereby inflict on others, or the dishonesties or treacheries\r\nor breaches of faith involved therein. Empires can only be conceived by\r\nNapoleons, Bismarcks, Disraelis, Richelieus, and Machiavellis. They can\r\nonly be built by Clives, Hastings, Wellesleys, and Dalhousies. Burkes\r\nand Gladstones cannot do that work, nor can Morleys, though they may\r\nconnive at others doing it, and might accept it as _fait accompli_.\r\n\r\n_Conquest of India Diplomatic, not Military._ The British conquest of\r\nIndia was not a military conquest in any sense of the term. They could\r\nnot conquer India except by playing on the fears of some and the hopes\r\nof others, and by seeking and getting the help of Indians, both moral\r\nand material. The record is as black as it could be; but nothing\r\nsucceeds like success, and all that is largely a forgotten page so far\r\nas the present generation of Indians is concerned. Only one feels\r\ndisposed to smile when one hears of Indian nationalists being charged in\r\nBritish-Indian courts with attempting to subvert “the government\r\nestablished by law.” One is inclined to ask “By what law?” and “Who made\r\nthat law?”\r\n\r\n_The Great Indian Mutiny of 1857._ We have, however, referred to this\r\nstory in these few words only to introduce the great Indian mutiny of\r\n1857, as the first Indian political movement of the nineteenth century.\r\n_The movement was national as well as political. The underlying causes\r\nand the contributory forces were many._ The union of the Hindus and\r\nMohammedans, the thoroughness of the organisation which preceded the\r\nmutiny, the stubbornness with which the mutineers fought, and the\r\ncomparatively few treacheries that characterised the mutinous campaign,\r\nall point to the same conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe mutiny, however, failed because the people on the whole had no faith\r\nin the constructive capacity of the mutineers. The mutineers had no\r\ndoubt agreed to postpone the question of the constructive ends in view,\r\nuntil after they had turned out the British, but the people could not.\r\nThe people’s patience had been exhausted by the military activities of\r\nthe preceding century and the accompanying disorder and anarchy, and\r\nthey saw before them the possibility of a recurrence of the same in the\r\ncase of success attending the arms of the mutineers. They hated the\r\nBritish; the Indian nobility and aristocracy, as well as the Indian\r\npeople, hated them. They sympathised with the mutineers; but they\r\nhelped them only half-heartedly. They had no faith in them. The ruling\r\nfamilies of India, the aristocracy and the nobility, were perhaps more\r\ndreaded and hated by the people than were the British. There was no one\r\nto rally them to one standard.\r\n\r\n_How the Mutiny was Put Down._ Here again it was British “diplomacy”\r\nthat saved the British situation. The British rallied to their support\r\nthe newly born aristocracy of the Punjab,--the Sikhs. The Sikhs had been\r\npersecuted and oppressed by the Mohammedans. They were not in a mood to\r\nlook favourably at the chance of Mohammedan supremacy being\r\nre-established in India. They had had enough of the “Turk,” as they\r\ncalled every Mohammedan; and they threw the whole weight of their\r\nrecently gathered virility on the side of the British. They were told\r\nand they believed, that in crushing the Mohammedan power, they were\r\nrevenging themselves on the slayers of Guru Teg Bahadur, the oppressors\r\nof Guru Govind Singh, and the murderers of his sons. It was the thought\r\nof Sirhind and the incidents associated with the name of that cursed\r\nplace,[45] that goaded them to the destruction of the last chance of\r\nMohammedan supremacy in India.\r\n\r\nThe mutiny failed, but its course showed with what intensity the\r\nmutineers hated the British. The Indians are a very kind-hearted\r\npeople; they would not injure even an ant, much less a human being, if\r\nthey could help it, but some of them were guilty of the most cruel\r\nexcesses during the mutiny. The British, too, in their turn did not\r\nspare the Indians in any way either during the mutiny or after it.\r\nInnocent and guilty alike were placed before the cannon and shot in\r\nlots.[46] In their marches through the country, British soldiers\r\ntortured men, women, and children,[47] and sometimes hung their heads\r\nor carcasses on the trees.[48] Both sides vied with each other in their\r\ncruelties.\r\n\r\nThe victors have immortalised the reprisals (or say, the iniquities) of\r\nthe vanquished by building permanent memorials on the spots where they\r\nwere perpetrated; their own, they have forgotten, and so have perhaps\r\nthe descendants of those who were the objects thereof, though they are\r\nrecorded in history.\r\n\r\nThe impression which a visit to these memorials leaves on the mind of an\r\nEnglish visitor can be better realised by the following extract from an\r\naccount published in _The Outlook_ (the English journal) on the 3rd of\r\nApril, 1915, over the signature of one F. G. A. Speaking of the mutiny\r\nmemories and monuments of Lucknow and Cawnpore, the writer remarks:\r\n\r\n“Their mutiny memories are quite distinct, as are the impressions they\r\nleave on the pilgrim to these shrines of heroism and devilry. The\r\nbattered ruins of Lucknow, testifying to a heroism so splendid as to rob\r\neven death of its sting, bring an inspiration that is almost joyous.\r\nEvery crumbling gateway and every gloomy cellar has its tale of heroic\r\nendurance and magnificent defence, and the final relief of the\r\nbeleaguered garrison wrote such a finis to the story as erased much of\r\nits earlier bitterness....\r\n\r\n“None of this forgiveness is conceivable in those who visit Cawnpore.\r\nEven the sculptured angel over the unspeakable Well bears, on one\r\nprofile at any rate, an expression of stern condemnation that holds out\r\nno promise of pardon. The atmosphere of historic Cawnpore is one of\r\nhaunting horror and a sadness that will not pass with the years. Time\r\nseems powerless to heal this rancour. I care not whether the pilgrim\r\nwanders through the beautiful Memorial Gardens (in which, significantly,\r\nno native is allowed to enter), feasting his eyes on the _blaze\r\nBougainvillæa_, or resting them in the shade of the peepul and the\r\nbanyan, or whether he lingers in the strangely Italian-looking Memorial\r\nChurch and reads the roll of honour that fills a series of mural\r\ntablets; everywhere his soul will be filled with gloom and will cry for\r\neternal vengeance on the authors of the massacre and on those who threw\r\nthe dying with the dead into the awful blackness of the pit. These\r\nmemories hold nothing but hate and horror, without one redeeming chapter\r\nto leaven them with comfort or forgiveness.”[49]\r\n\r\nThe English are mistaken if they think that a reading of the history of\r\nthe mutiny and the excesses and cruelties indulged in by the British\r\ndoes not excite similar feeling in the minds of the Indians. The\r\nBritish can express their feelings freely. The Indians cannot; their\r\nfeelings must be repressed.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be better for both parties to try to wipe off the\r\npast in a spirit of mutual trust and mutual good will, which is only\r\npossible if England were to cease to pursue a policy of exploiting India\r\nand to establish her connection with India on a basis of equality,\r\nhonesty and justice. That can only be done by treating her as a partner\r\nin the Empire and not as a mere “dependency” or “possession.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nINDIA FROM 1857 TO 1905\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I--FROM 1857 TO 1885\r\n\r\nThe mutiny was quelled. The ringleaders among the mutineers were killed,\r\nhanged or shot, and with them a lot of those who were innocent. Many of\r\nthe rank and file were pardoned, as no government could shoot or hang\r\nall those who had taken part in the mutiny. Their number was legion. The\r\nBritish Empire in India was saved, but the East India Company was gone.\r\nThe system of open pillage was ended. The crown assumed the direct\r\ngovernment of India. The Queen’s Proclamation and the policy of “mercy\r\nand reconciliation” inaugurated by Canning calmed the country.\r\n\r\n_The Bengalee Babu._ The only parts of the country which had received\r\nsome education on modern lines were the provinces of Bengal, Bombay and\r\nMadras. The number of educated men even in these provinces was small. In\r\nthe work of settlement that followed the mutiny, these educated men\r\nfound ample scope for their ambition. Men who knew English had the\r\nadvantage over those who did not. Men with a knowledge of English were\r\nfew. The posts requiring a knowledge of that language were many.\r\nConsequently, the English-knowing Indians were in great demand and\r\nsecured ample salaries to make them “happy and loyal.” The\r\nEnglish-knowing Bengalees spread over the whole of Northern India,\r\nlately the scene of mutiny, and materially helped in bringing about\r\nsettled conditions of life. They were the pioneers in every department\r\nof governmental activity and were looked to, both by the rulers and the\r\npeople, for advice and guidance. The Bengalee is a sentimental being.\r\nHis position under the Government filled him with pride and his\r\ngratitude and loyalty were overflowing. The British also liked him\r\nbecause he was useful, intelligent, keen, shrewd, ready to serve, and\r\nwilling to be of use. He relieved the British officer of much of his\r\nintellectual work, and left him ample time for play and rest. Many a\r\ndepartmental head ruled the country with the brain of the “Bengalee\r\nBabu.” The Bengalee Babu worshipped the Feringhee[50] as _Mai Bap_,[51]\r\nand began to imitate him in his tastes. He began to live as the\r\nBritisher lived; English life, English manners and customs, became his\r\nideal. Gradually he became very fond of English literature and began to\r\nthink as an Englishman thought. The Bengalees were the first to send\r\ntheir sons to England for their education and to compete for the I. C.\r\nS. (Indian Civil Service) and the I. M. S. (Indian Medical Service).\r\nThey with the Parsees were the first to qualify for the English bar. In\r\nEngland they lived in an atmosphere of freedom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAM MOHAN ROY]\r\n\r\nWith freedom in drinking and eating they also learned freedom of thought\r\nand expression.\r\n\r\nThe first generation of the Bengalees was thus Anglicised through and\r\nthrough. They looked down upon their own religion; they thought poorly\r\nof Indian society. They knew nothing of their own past history, and they\r\nglorified in being “Sahibs.”[52] Some of them became Christians. Alarmed\r\nat this transformation, Ram Mohan Roy and a few others resolved to stem\r\nthe tide. For a time they succeeded, but only partially. Be it said to\r\nthe credit of the Bengalees that a fairly good number refused to be\r\ncarried down-stream, and in spite of their English education stuck to\r\ntheir own religion and their own customs. They saw a good deal in their\r\nsociety which needed reform; but they declined to make sweeping changes\r\nand would not imitate. These veterans laid the foundations of the modern\r\nBengalee literature. They wanted to pour their knowledge, derived from a\r\nstudy of English language and literature, into their own mother tongue,\r\nand in order to enlarge the vocabulary of the latter for their work,\r\nthey had to study Sanskrit. Thus in spite of the Anglification of the\r\nfirst generation of Bengalees, there grew up a class of men imbued with\r\nnationalistic tendencies. Ram Mohan Roy, the founder of Brahmo Samaj,\r\nwas the first nation-builder of Modern India.\r\n\r\nFor a time the field that was opened for the employment of\r\nEnglish-educated Bengalees in Upper India (in the then N. W. Provinces,\r\nin the Punjab, in Behar, in Central India, in Rajputana, even in Sindh)\r\nchecked the growth of these tendencies. The feeling of gratitude and\r\ncontentment was supreme. The Bengalee was indispensable in almost every\r\ndepartment. The reins of practical management were mostly in Bengalee\r\nhands, whether it was a court of justice, or a Revenue Commissioner’s\r\noffice, or a commissariat depot, of an adjutant’s camp, or the\r\ndepartment of land survey, or education. The heads of departments were\r\nalways English, but the heads of ministerial establishments were\r\ngenerally Bengalees. The English could not do without them. The former\r\ndid not know the language of the country, nor did they know the\r\ncharacter of the people. The Bengalees were thus an absolute necessity.\r\nWith the spread of a knowledge of the English language, the first\r\ngeneration of English-knowing Indians in every province came to occupy\r\nan important position. While the old-fashioned Pandit or Moulvie sulked,\r\nthe English-knowing Hindu or Mohammedan basked in sunshine and\r\nflourished. The British laid down policies and gave orders; the\r\nEnglish-knowing Indian saw that they were carried out. They thus came to\r\nenjoy the confidence of their masters and imitated their vices.\r\n\r\nBut what was most important was that they began to think like their\r\nEnglish masters. The English read their newspapers; so the Indians\r\nstarted their newspapers. The English met in clubs and churches. So the\r\nIndians started Samajes and Sabhas and debating clubs. For a time the\r\nEnglish-knowing Indian prided himself in imitating his master. He took\r\nhis dress, he took his cheroot and pipe, and also his cup and beefsteak.\r\nHe began to live in houses built and furnished in the English way. He\r\ndetested Indian life and took pride in being Anglicised. Everything\r\nIndian was odious in his eyes. The Indians were barbarians; their\r\nreligion was a bundle of superstitions; they were dirty people; their\r\ncustoms and manners were uncivilised; they were a set of narrow-minded\r\nbigots who did not know that man was born free. So the English set the\r\nfashion for them in everything. If their English masters went to church\r\nand read the Bible, they did the same. If the English masters indulged\r\nin free-thinking, they did the same. They wanted to be like their\r\nEnglish masters in every way. Their ambition, however, soon met a check.\r\nThey could equal the British in drinking and in free-thinking, but they\r\ncould not aspire to his position and place in the government of the\r\ncountry. Some of them decided to try this in the case of their sons.\r\nThey sent them to England. A few passed the Indian Civil Service and the\r\nIndian Medical Service examinations, others became barristers. Both\r\nfound out by bitter experience that, however able and clever they might\r\nbe, whatever their intellectual acquirements, no matter if they were\r\nChristians, or semi-Christians, or free-thinkers, there was a limit to\r\ntheir aspirations both in service and out of it. That was the first\r\neye-opener.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the thoughtful among the Indians, who had not taken to\r\nEnglish manners, were anxiously watching the flow of the current. They\r\nsaw the disintegrating and denationalising forces that were at work;\r\nthey saw that their national edifice was crumbling down brick by brick;\r\neverything which they had valued and held sacred was being devastated\r\nand treated with contempt and reduced to ashes. Their own children were\r\ndeserting the old banners to which innumerable generations before them\r\nhad clung with love and reverence. They saw all this; they were sorry;\r\nthey wept tears of blood; but they could do nothing. They were powerless\r\nbefore the tide. They tried palliatives, but failed. What was fatal to\r\ntheir pious wishes was that they could not themselves resist the fruits\r\nwhich English education brought in the shape of emoluments and rank and\r\nposition. They wanted these fruits without the thorns. They soon found\r\nthat that was impossible, and so they gave up the struggle in despair\r\nand became reconciled to the inevitable. What they failed to achieve\r\nwas, however, brought about by a combination of circumstances which we\r\nwill briefly enumerate below.\r\n\r\n_Forces Resisting Denationalisation._ 1. The English education imparted\r\nin schools and colleges established by the British, and the Christian\r\nmissions (in some instances supplemented by Indian agencies), opened the\r\ngates of Western thought and Western literature to the mass of educated\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\n2. Some of the British teachers and professors who taught in the schools\r\nand colleges consciously and unconsciously inspired their pupils with\r\nideas of freedom as well as nationalism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SWAMI VIVEKANANDA]\r\n\r\n3. The over-zeal of the missionaries in their attacks upon Indian\r\nreligions and Indian thought suggested to Indian minds a closer and\r\ndeeper study of their own religion and thought.\r\n\r\n4. In this they were materially helped by the awakening of Europeans to\r\nthe thought of the East. The labours of the European savants and their\r\nappreciation of Eastern thought kindled a fresh fire in the bosom of\r\nHindus and Mohammedans.\r\n\r\n5. The writings of Ram Mohan Roy, Debendra Nath Tagore, Rajendra Lal\r\nMitra, in Bengal, those of Ranade, Vishnu Pandit and others in\r\nMahrashtra, of Swami Dayanand and Sir Syed Ahmad Khan in Upper India, of\r\nMadam Blavatsky and the other Theosophists in Madras, brought about a\r\nnew awakening, which afterwards received an even stronger impetus from\r\nthe writings and speeches of Mrs. Annie Besant and Swami Vivekananda.\r\nThis was on the religious and social side mainly, but its national\r\ncharacter was unmistakable.\r\n\r\n_Political Disappointments._ The current produced by these causes met\r\nanother current, which was generated by political disappointments. The\r\naspirations of the educated Indian had met a check. The few successes\r\ngained by Indians in the Indian Civil Service examinations alarmed the\r\nBritish, and they sought for means of keeping them out. One of the means\r\nadopted was to require that the candidates should not be more than 19 to\r\n21 years of age at the time of examination, an age so young as made it\r\nimpossible for Indians to come over to England and successfully compete.\r\nThis raised a howl and cry in Bengal, and the rest of the country\r\nfollowed Bengal. Then came other measures like the Vernacular Press Act\r\nof Lord Lytton, and the remission of cotton duties,[53] and so on. The\r\ngeneration educated in England had some experience of the methods of\r\npolitical agitation in that country, and they soon began to organise on\r\nthose lines. Political agitation on modern lines thus became a fact of\r\nIndian life, and English-educated Indians began to talk of liberty and\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nThus were laid the foundations of the national awakening, of which so\r\nmuch has been heard of late. The methods of the English Government in\r\nIndia, their educational system, their press, their laws, their courts,\r\ntheir railways, their telegraphs, their post-offices, their steamers,\r\nhad as much to do with it as the native love of country, of religion and\r\nnation, which had received a temporary check by the crushing defeat of\r\nthe mutineers in 1857, and by the Indian people’s too ready acquiescence\r\nin the political and social domination of the foreigner which ensued.\r\n\r\nThis time, however, the movement was brought into existence by those who\r\nhad received their inspiration from Europe. Within less than twenty\r\nyears after the great mutiny, the Nationalist Movement of India was\r\nborn, almost at the same time and place at which Lord Lytton was\r\npresiding at the great Imperial Durbar, and announcing that the great\r\nQueen of England was assuming the title of Empress of India. The Durbar\r\nreduced the chiefs of India from the position of allies to that of\r\nfeudatories, but it quite unconsciously and against the intentions of\r\nits authors raised in theory the status of the Indian subjects of the\r\nQueen to that of citizens of the British Empire. Little did the authors\r\nof that Durbar realise the inner significance of the move they were\r\nmaking. That Durbar, we may say, marked the beginning of the movement\r\nwhich filled the educated Indian with the idea of obtaining his rightful\r\nplace in the Empire. He became articulate and began to assert himself.\r\nHe was no longer satisfied with the minor positions which he held in the\r\nGovernment of India. He claimed his country as his own, and raised the\r\ncry of “India for the Indians.” His cry gained strength when he found\r\nthat the India which he looked down upon in the fifties or sixties, the\r\nsystem of thought and life which he considered barbarous, primitive and\r\nold fashioned, and the past which he despised, were after all not so bad\r\nas he had thought.\r\n\r\nThe latter was the contribution of the Brahmo Samaj, the Theosophical\r\nSociety, the Society for the Resuscitation of Sanskrit Literature, the\r\nBengal Sahitya Parishad, the Maharastra Sabha, the Arya Samaj, the\r\nSanatan Sabhas and other societies of a similar nature. The Bengali and\r\nthe Mahratta writers, who had carried on researches in Indian history\r\nand unearthed valuable documents and written in their respective\r\nvernaculars, contributed materially to the growth of this feeling. The\r\nTheosophical Society began to praise and justify every Hindu institution\r\nand to find science in every custom. In fact, for a time, the\r\nthoughtful began to fear lest the pendulum was swinging the other way\r\nand we were in the midst of a wave of reaction.\r\n\r\n_Lord Ripon._ India was in this state of fermentation, religious, social\r\nand political, when Lord Ripon was appointed to the viceroyalty of\r\nIndia. Lord Ripon was an exceedingly kind man and commanded a broad\r\noutlook. He was very lucky in having come on the heels of an exceedingly\r\nunpopular Viceroy like Lord Lytton. Lord Lytton was a Tory of pronounced\r\nimperial tendencies. Under the inspiration of Disraeli, he had by an\r\nunworthy trick on the ruling chiefs of India changed their position from\r\nthat of allies to that of feudatories; he had gagged the vernacular\r\npress by his press legislation; he had blundered into a bloody Afghan\r\nwar and was responsible for several other reactionary measures. Lord\r\nRipon started by undoing most of what Lord Lytton had done. He repealed\r\nthe Vernacular Press Act, which at once set the seal of popular approval\r\non his administration. The most important of his achievements were,\r\nhowever, constructive. He formulated a policy of local government, and\r\nthus laid the foundations of representative institutions in India; he\r\nsubstituted merit for patronage and jobbery in filling public services,\r\nby organising competitive examinations for filling a certain number of\r\nposts in the higher branches of the subordinate services; last but not\r\nleast, he resolved to so alter the criminal law as to place the European\r\nand the Indian on an equal footing in the matter of trials.\r\n\r\nAll this aroused the bitterest anger of the Anglo-Indian officialdom.\r\nThe Anglo-Indians opposed every one of these measures. They ridiculed\r\nthe idea of introducing any measure of local self-government in India,\r\nand predicted that that must be the beginning of the end. They called\r\nthe measure rash and ill-advised and impracticable. The natives were\r\nincapable of self-government, they said. Their religious and social\r\ndifferences made it impossible. Officialdom was equally opposed to the\r\nfilling of any posts in government service by open competition. This\r\nwould bring in the “Babu,” and the “Babu” they had now begun to hate and\r\nlook down upon. The “Babu” was a “low-caste hybrid,” who wrote bad\r\nEnglish and talked of liberty and equality, who lacked in qualities of\r\ndocility and submissiveness, which had so far characterised persons\r\nappointed by selection. This interfered materially with the prestige of\r\nthe Lord of the District, as people could now get “high” appointments\r\nunder the Government independently of him. Why should the people respect\r\nhim any more? His was a government by prestige, and measures like these\r\nof Lord Ripon would destroy it. So prophesied the heaven-born “white\r\nBrahmins.” But the worst offence of Lord Ripon was the “Ilbert\r\nBill,”[54] which aimed at placing the European and the Indian on an\r\nequal footing in the eyes of the law, and would remove the disabilities\r\nof the Indian Magistrate in the matter of the trial of the white men.\r\n“Shall we be judged by the Nigger?” “shall he send us to jail?” “shall\r\nhe be put in authority over us? Never! It is impossible! Better that\r\nBritish rule in India should end than that we be obliged to submit to\r\nsuch humiliating laws.” The whole tribe of the Anglo-Indians (official\r\nand non-official) opposed the measure most vehemently, and attacked Lord\r\nRipon as never viceroy was attacked before by his own countrymen in\r\nIndia. They called him insulting names, passed resolutions condemning\r\nhis administration wholesale, proposed his recall before the expiration\r\nof his period of office, and did everything possible to make him feel\r\nthat they hated him.\r\n\r\nHis unpopularity among the Anglo-Indians made him popular among the\r\nIndians. The press and the platform sang his praise. The country was\r\nablaze with excitement. Never before under British rule had the country\r\nbeen so enthusiastic in political matters. In Lord Ripon, they thought,\r\nthey had found a political Messiah. They gave him addresses, unharnessed\r\nthe horses from his carriage, in many places, and otherwise showed their\r\nlove and regard for him, which exasperated the European community beyond\r\nmeasure. The Europeans saw in all this a menace to their power, and the\r\nbeginning of the end of imperial despotism in India. They thought they\r\nwere on the verge of losing India. In Lord Ripon the Indians recognised\r\nthe first British viceroy who was prepared to make an honest attempt at\r\ngiving effect to the pledges given and the promises made by Queen\r\nVictoria in her famous proclamation of 1858, when the administration of\r\nIndia passed into the hands of the regular British Government. Lord\r\nRipon lost the battle on the particular measure which had aroused the\r\nanger of the European community more than anything else, viz., his\r\nproposed amendment of the Criminal Procedure Code. A compromise was made\r\nby which the principle of the bill was really abandoned. But he had\r\nraised hopes and aspiration which were, so to say, the beginning of\r\npolitical life in India. On the expiration of his term of office, the\r\nIndians agitated for an extension of his term, which was not granted.\r\nHowever, they gave him a farewell which still rings in the ears of the\r\nolder generation of Indians who took part in it, in Calcutta, in Bombay,\r\nin Benares, and other places.\r\n\r\nLord Ripon left a permanent impression on the minds of the Indians. Lord\r\nHardinge has won a great deal of popularity, but it is doubtful if he is\r\nso universally loved and honoured as Lord Ripon was.\r\n\r\n_Lord Dufferin._ However, the point of the story is, that when Lord\r\nRipon left India, the country was in a state of perturbation. There was\r\na great deal of tension still lingering between the Indian and the\r\nEuropean communities. The fire was still smouldering when Lord Dufferin\r\ntook charge of the office of viceroyalty. He had been brought up in\r\ndiplomacy. To him diplomacy was like mother’s milk. He was a diplomat by\r\nbirth as well as by training. His mission was to appease the anger of\r\nthe governing class and in a quiet way to undo what Lord Ripon had done.\r\nBut he thought that perhaps it might be dangerous to go at it straight.\r\nThe cry of political liberty and political equality had been raised. It\r\nwas impossible to satisfy it; yet it might be dangerous to strangle it\r\nby force. It was impossible to revive the Vernacular Press Act of Lord\r\nLytton. It was impossible to stifle political life which had sprung up\r\nin the atmosphere created by Lord Ripon’s policy, and which was making a\r\nrather precocious growth. The more it was opposed, ridiculed and\r\ndespised, the more it thrived. So he decided to guide it and to make it\r\nas innocuous as it could be without rousing the suspicions of those who\r\nwere to be the tools.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II. THE BIRTH OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS\r\n\r\n_Indian National Congress an English Product._ It is an undisputed\r\nhistorical fact, that the idea of the Indian National Congress was a\r\nproduct of Lord Dufferin’s brain; that he suggested it to Mr. Hume,[55]\r\nand that the latter undertook to work it out. We have no means of\r\nknowing whether Mr. Hume communicated the fact to all the Indian leaders\r\nwho joined hands with him in organising it, but in all probability he\r\ntold some of them. It leaked out, however, in Lord Dufferin’s lifetime,\r\nwas published in the press, brought to his notice and never denied by\r\nhim. Nor did Mr. Hume, who died only in 1912, ever deny it. It has since\r\nbeen admitted to be true by his biographer, another veteran Congress\r\nleader, Sir William Wedderburn.[56] Sir William says on page 59 of his\r\nlife of Mr. Hume: “_Indeed in initiating the National Movement, Mr. Hume\r\ntook counsel with the viceroy, Lord Dufferin; and whereas he was himself\r\ndisposed to begin his reform propaganda on the social side, it was\r\napparently by Lord Dufferin’s advice that he took up the work of\r\npolitical organisation as the first matter to be dealt with._” We have\r\nno hesitation in accepting the accuracy of the statement made by Sir\r\nWilliam Wedderburn as to what Lord Dufferin told Mr. Hume, because we\r\nhave no doubt of Mr. Hume’s sincerity of purpose. Lord Dufferin did\r\nevidently tell Mr. Hume that “as head of the Government, he had found\r\nthe greatest difficulty in ascertaining the real wishes of the people;\r\nand that for purposes of administration it would be a public benefit, if\r\nthere existed some responsible organisation through which the Government\r\nmight be kept informed regarding the best Indian public opinion.” Sir\r\nWilliam Wedderburn assures us that “these kindly counsels (_i. e._,\r\nthose given by Lord Dufferin) were received with grateful appreciation\r\nby all concerned,” and “indeed so cordial were the relations” between\r\nthe officials and the Congress leaders that “Lord Dufferin was\r\napproached with a view to the first Congress being held under the\r\npresidency of Lord Reay, then Governor of Bombay.” We are told that Lord\r\nDufferin welcomed the proposal as showing the desire of the Congress to\r\nwork in complete harmony with the Government, but he saw many\r\ndifficulties in accepting the proposal, and so the idea was abandoned.\r\n“None the less the first Congress was opened with the friendly sympathy\r\nof the highest authorities.”\r\n\r\nSo this is the genesis of the Congress, and this alone is sufficient to\r\ncondemn it in the eyes of the advanced Nationalists. There is no\r\nparallel to this in the history of the world. Who has ever heard of a\r\nmovement for political liberty being initiated by a despotic government,\r\nwhich is foreign in its agency and foreign in its methods?\r\n\r\n_Hume, a Lover of Liberty._ It is obvious that when Lord Dufferin\r\nexpected a political organisation to represent the best Indian opinion,\r\nit was far from his mind to suggest an organisation that would demand\r\nparliamentary government for India, or self-government even on colonial\r\nlines. What he evidently aimed at was a sort of an innocuous association\r\nwhich should serve more as a “safety valve” than as a genuine\r\nNationalist organisation for national purposes. Mr. Hume may have meant\r\nmore. He was a lover of liberty and wanted political liberty for India\r\nunder the _ægis_ of the British crown. He was an English patriot and as\r\nsuch he wanted the continuance of British connection with India. He saw\r\ndanger to British rule in discontent going underground, and one of his\r\nobjects in establishing the Congress was to save British rule in India\r\nfrom an impending calamity of the gravest kind which he thought was\r\nthreatening it at that time. In his reply to Sir Auckland Colvin,[57] he\r\nadmitted that “a safety valve for the escape of great and growing\r\nforces generated by” British “connection, was urgently needed, and no\r\nmore efficacious safety valve than” the “Congress movement could\r\npossibly be devised.” This correspondence between Sir Auckland Colvin,\r\nthen Lieutenant Governor of the United Provinces, and Mr. Hume, reveals\r\nthe whole genesis of the Congress movement, and is so clear and\r\nilluminating that no student of Indian politics can afford to neglect\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt leaves no doubt whatsoever that the immediate motive which underlay\r\nthe idea of starting the Congress was to save the Empire from “the\r\ndanger” that loomed ahead “tremendous in the immediate future,” “the\r\nmisery of the masses acted on by the bitter resentment of individuals\r\namong the educated class.” In the words of Mr. Hume, “no choice was left\r\nto those who gave the primary impetus to the movement. The ferment, the\r\ncreation of Western ideas, education, invention, and appliances, was at\r\nwork with a rapidly increasing intensity, and it became of paramount\r\nimportance to find for its products an overt and constitutional channel\r\nfor discharge, instead of leaving them to fester as they had already\r\ncommenced to do, under the surface.” Mr. Hume further adds that though\r\n“in certain provinces and from certain points of view the movement was\r\npremature, _yet from the most important point of view, the future\r\nmaintenance of the integrity of the British Empire_, the real question\r\nwhen the Congress started, was, not is it premature, but is it too late?\r\nwill the country now accept it?” Indeed, by that test, the events have\r\nproved that the Indian National Congress has been a great success, and\r\nthat either Mr. Hume’s reading of the political situation was\r\nexaggerated, or that his remedy has been amply justified.\r\n\r\n_Congress to Save British Empire from Danger._ But one thing is clear,\r\nthat the Congress was started more with the object of saving the British\r\nEmpire from danger than with that of winning political liberty for\r\nIndia. The interests of the British Empire were primary and those of\r\nIndia only secondary, and no one can say that the Congress has not been\r\ntrue to that ideal. It might be said with justice and reason that the\r\nfounders of the Indian National Congress considered the maintenance of\r\nBritish rule in India of vital importance to India herself, and\r\ntherefore were anxious to do everything in their power, not only to save\r\nthat rule from any danger that threatened it, but even to strengthen it;\r\nthat with them the redress of political grievances and the political\r\nadvance of India was only a by-product and of secondary importance. If\r\nso, the Congress has been true to its ideal, and no one can find fault\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nOn the strength of an illuminating memorandum found among his papers,\r\nHume’s biographer has stated the nature of the evidence that “convinced”\r\nMr. Hume at the time (_i.e._, about 15 months before Lord Lytton left\r\nIndia) that the British were “in immediate danger of a terrible\r\noutbreak.” We will give it in Mr. Hume’s own words.\r\n\r\n“I was shown seven large volumes (corresponding to a certain mode of\r\ndividing the country, excluding Burmah, Assam, and some minor tracts)\r\ncontaining a vast number of entries; English abstracts or\r\ntranslations--longer or shorter--of vernacular reports or communications\r\nof one kind or another, all arranged according to districts (not\r\nidentical with ours), sub-districts, sub-divisions, and the cities,\r\ntowns and villages included in these. The number of these entries was\r\nenormous; there were said, at the time, to be communications from over\r\nthirty thousand different reporters. I did not count them, they seemed\r\ncountless; but in regard to the towns and villages of one district of\r\nthe Northwest Provinces with which I possess a peculiarly intimate\r\nacquaintance--a troublesome part of the country, no doubt--there were\r\nnearly three hundred entries, a good number of which I could partially\r\nverify, as to the names of the people, etc.” He mentions that he had the\r\nvolumes in his possession only for about a week; into six of them he\r\nonly dipped; but he closely examined one covering the greater portion of\r\nthe Northwest Provinces, Oudh, Behar, parts of Bundelkund and parts of\r\nthe Punjab; and so far as possible verified the entries referring to\r\nthose districts with which he had special personal acquaintance. Many of\r\nthe entries reported conversations between men of the lowest\r\nclasses,[58] “all going to show that these poor men were pervaded with a\r\nsense of the hopelessness of the existing state of affairs; that they\r\nwere convinced that they would starve and die, and that they wanted to\r\ndo _something_, and stand by each other, _and that something meant\r\nviolence_,” (for innumerable entries referred to the secretion of old\r\nswords, spears and matchlocks, which would be ready when required. It\r\nwas not supposed that the immediate result, in its initial stages, would\r\nbe a revolt against the Government, or a revolt at all in the proper\r\nsense of the word. What was predicted was a sudden violent outbreak of\r\nsporadic crimes, murders of obnoxious persons, robbery of bankers,\r\nlooting of bazaars). “In the existing state of the lowest half-starving\r\nclasses, it was considered that the first few crimes would be the signal\r\nfor hundreds of similar ones, and for a general development of\r\nlawlessness, paralysing the authorities and the respectable classes. It\r\nwas considered also, that everywhere the small bands would begin to\r\ncoalesce into large ones, like drops of water on a leaf; that all the\r\nbad characters in the country would join, and that very soon after the\r\nbands obtained formidable proportions, a certain small number of the\r\neducated classes, at the time desperately, perhaps, unreasonably, bitter\r\nagainst the Government, would join the movement, assume here and there\r\nthe lead, give the outbreak cohesion, and direct it as a national\r\nrevolt.”\r\n\r\nTo this, Sir William Wedderburn adds further from his own personal\r\nknowledge:\r\n\r\n“The forecast of trouble throughout India was in exact accordance with\r\nwhat actually occurred, under my own observation, in the Bombay\r\nPresidency, in connection with the Agrarian rising known as the Deccan\r\nriots. These began with sporadic gang robberies and attacks on the\r\nmoney lenders, until the bands of dacoits, combining together, became\r\ntoo strong for the police; and the whole military force at Poona, horse,\r\nfoot, and artillery, had to take the field against them. Roaming through\r\nthe jungle tracts of the Western Ghauts, these bands dispersed in the\r\npresence of military forces, only to reunite immediately at some\r\nconvenient point; and from the hill stations of Mahableshwar and\r\nMatheran we could at night see the light of their campfires in all\r\ndirections. A leader from the more instructed class was found, calling\r\nhimself Sivaji, the Second, who addressed challenges to the Government,\r\noffered a reward of 500 rupees for the head of H. E. Sir Richard Temple\r\n(then Governor of Bombay), and claimed to lead a national revolt upon\r\nthe lines on which the Mahratta power had originally been founded.”\r\n\r\nSo in the words of these two leaders, the immediate motive of the\r\nCongress was to save the British Empire from this danger. There is,\r\nhowever, one difficulty in believing outright that this was the\r\nimmediate reason of the birth of the Congress. Mr. Hume is said to have\r\nseen this evidence at the time he was in the service of the Government,\r\nviz., fifteen months before Lord Lytton left India. Between then and the\r\nfirst meeting of the Congress in 1885 intervened a period of about seven\r\nyears. During this time Lord Ripon was viceroy for five years. The idea\r\nof starting a political organisation on the lines of the Congress is\r\nsaid to have originated with Lord Dufferin.\r\n\r\nThis is a little inconsistent with the theory that the Congress was\r\nfounded out of fear of a political outbreak and only in the nature of a\r\nsafety valve. Nor is the latter theory consistent with Mr. Hume’s first\r\npolitical manifesto addressed to the graduates of the Calcutta\r\nUniversity in March, 1883. This document is so manly in its\r\noutspokenness, so true in its principles, that we will quote the whole\r\nof it (or at least as much of it as is given in Mr. Hume’s biography).\r\nAddressing the graduates of the university, Mr. Hume said:\r\n\r\n“Constituting, as you do, a large body of the most highly educated\r\nIndians, you should, in the natural order of things, constitute also the\r\nmost important source of all mental, moral, social, and political\r\nprogress in India. _Whether in the individual or the nation, all vital\r\nprogress must spring from within, and it is to you, her most cultured\r\nand enlightened minds, her most favoured sons, that your country must\r\nlook for the initiative._ In vain may aliens, like myself, love India\r\nand her children, as well as the most loving of these; in vain may they,\r\nfor her and their good, give time and trouble, money and thought; in\r\nvain may they struggle and sacrifice; they may assist with advice and\r\nsuggestions; they may place their experience, abilities and knowledge at\r\nthe disposal of the workers, but they lack the essential of nationality,\r\nand the real work must ever be done by the people of the country\r\nthemselves.” “Scattered individuals, however capable and however well\r\nmeaning, are powerless singly. What is needed is union, organisation and\r\na well defined line of action; and to secure these an association is\r\nrequired, armed and organised with unusual care, having for its object\r\nto promote the mental, moral, social and political regeneration of the\r\npeople of India. Our little army must be _sui generis_ in discipline and\r\nequipment, and the question simply is, how many of you will prove to\r\npossess, in addition to your high scholastic attainments, the\r\nunselfishness, moral courage, self-control, and active spirit of\r\nbenevolence which are essential in all who should enlist?”\r\n\r\nEven truer and nobler are the sentiments in the final appeal which ended\r\nthis letter and which runs thus:\r\n\r\n“As I said before, you are the salt of the land. _And if amongst even\r\nyou, the élite, fifty men can not be found with sufficient power of\r\nself-sacrifice, sufficient love for and pride in their country,\r\nsufficient genuine and unselfish heartfelt patriotism to take the\r\ninitiative, and if needs be, devote the rest of their lives to the\r\ncause, then there is no hope for India._ Her sons must and will remain\r\nmere humble and helpless instruments in the hands of foreign rulers, for\r\n‘_they who would be free, themselves must strike the blow_.’ And if even\r\nthe leaders of thought are all either such poor creatures, or so\r\nselfishly wedded to personal concerns, that they dare not or will not\r\nstrike a blow for their country’s sake, then justly and rightly are they\r\nkept down and trampled on, for they deserve nothing better. _Every\r\nnation secures precisely as good a government as it merits._ If you, the\r\npicked men, the most highly educated of the nation, can not, scorning\r\npersonal ease and selfish ends, _make a resolute struggle to secure\r\nfreedom for yourselves and your country_, a more impartial\r\nadministration, a larger share in the management of your own affairs,\r\nthen we, your friends, are wrong, and our adversaries right; then are\r\nLord Ripon’s aspirations for your good, fruitless and visionary; then,\r\nat present, at any rate, all hopes of progress are at an end, and India\r\ntruly neither lacks nor deserves any better government than she now\r\nenjoys. Only, if this be so, let us hear no more factious, peevish\r\ncomplaints that you are kept in leading strings, and treated like\r\nchildren, for you will have proved yourselves such. _Men know how to\r\nact._ Let there be no more complaints of Englishmen being preferred to\r\nyou in all important offices, for if you lack that public spirit, that\r\nhighest form of altruistic devotion that leads men to subordinate\r\nprivate ease to the public weal, that true patriotism that has made\r\nEnglishmen what they are, then rightly are these preferred to you, and\r\nrightly and inevitably have they become your rulers. And rulers and\r\ntaskmasters they must continue, let the yoke gall your shoulders ever so\r\nsorely, until you realise and stand prepared to act upon the eternal\r\ntruth, _whether in the case of individuals or nations, self-sacrifice\r\nand unselfishness are the only unfailing guides to freedom and\r\nhappiness_.”\r\n\r\nThe capitals and italics are, except in two cases, ours. In the original\r\nthere are only two italics, (1) the word _themselves_ in the sentence\r\n“they who would be free, _themselves_ must strike the blow,” and, (2)\r\n“_Men_ know how to act.” Now these are not the words of a diplomat, much\r\nless those of a hypocrite. Mr. Hume was too noble not to mean what he\r\nsaid, and the present writer has no doubt but that Mr. Hume was\r\nabsolutely sincere in what he said. He had a passion for liberty. His\r\nheart bled at the sight of so much misery and poverty as prevailed in\r\nIndia, and which according to him was preventable by good government. He\r\nburned with indignation at the “cowardly” behaviour of his countrymen\r\ntowards Indians, and he could not help feeling ashamed at the way in\r\nwhich pledges given and promises made were being ignored. He was an\r\nardent student of history and knew full well that no government, whether\r\nnational or foreign, had conceded to popular demands without pressure\r\nfrom below. In the case of an alien government, the chances were even\r\nstill more meagre. He therefore wanted the Indians “to strike” for their\r\nliberty if they wanted it. The first step was to organise. So he advised\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\nNor are we prepared to believe that men like Ranade, Tilak, Naoroji, W.\r\nC. Bonnerjea, Ajudhia Nath, and Tyabji, were only tools in the hands of\r\nthe Britishers. No, we do not think so. They were all true and good\r\npatriots. They loved their country and they started the Congress with\r\nthe best of motives. It is possible that with some British sympathisers,\r\nthe interests of the British Empire were primary, and they sided with\r\nthe Congress because they believed that thereby they could best secure\r\nthe Empire; but the writer of this book knows from personal experience\r\nhow deeply the love of humanity and liberty is embedded in the hearts of\r\nsome Britishers, and he is compelled to believe that at least some of\r\nthose who showed their sympathy with the Congress were of that kind.\r\n\r\nThe Imperialist Junker and Jingo calls such men “Little Englanders,” but\r\nthe truth is that their hearts are too big to be imperial. They believe\r\nin humanity, and in liberty being the birthright of every human being.\r\nIn their eyes a tyrant, one who robs others of their liberty, one who\r\nbases his greatness on the exploitation of others, or deprives them of\r\ntheir rights by might or clever diplomacy, does not cease to be so by\r\nthe fact of his being their countryman. They are patriots themselves and\r\nwill shed the last drop of their blood in the defence of their liberty,\r\nand in the defence of their country’s liberty and independence, but\r\ntheir patriotism does not extend to the point of _applauding_ their\r\ncountry’s robbing others of theirs. Yes, there are Britons who are\r\nsincere friends of the cause of liberty all over the globe. They deplore\r\nthat their country should be ruling India at all, and if it were in\r\ntheir power, they would at once withdraw from India. Some of these\r\nsympathise with the Indian Nationalists in all sincerity, and have done\r\nso ever since the Indian National Congress was started, or even from\r\nbefore that time. It is no fault of theirs, if the Indian Nationalist\r\nMovement has not been such a success as they would have wished it to be,\r\nand if it has not been able to achieve anything very tangible. The\r\nfault is purely that of the Indians, and of the Indians alone, or of the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nMr. Hume was quite sincere in his motives, but he forgot that a\r\npolitical organisation started at the instance or even with the approval\r\nof the rulers whose power and emoluments it proposed to curtail, whose\r\ndespotism and principles it questioned, in short, whom it proposed to\r\ndisplace and dethrone, was an anomaly; it was unnatural. In their desire\r\nto have an easy and unopposed start, the Indian founders of the National\r\nCongress forgot their history, and consequently ignored the truth that\r\n“those who wanted to be free must themselves strike the blow,” and that\r\nit was monstrous to expect those against whom the blow was aimed to\r\nbless the striker and the striking. We do not agree with Mr. Gokhale\r\nthat “no Indian could have started the Indian National Congress” and\r\nthat “if the founder of the Congress had not been a great Englishman and\r\na distinguished ex-official, such was the official distrust of political\r\nagitation in those days that the authorities would have at once found\r\nsome way or other to suppress the movement.”\r\n\r\nFirst, political agitation did not start with the Congress. It had been\r\nstarted before and no attempt to suppress it had succeeded. Second, the\r\ndistrust of political agitation in India was not greater in those days\r\nthan it is now and has been during the life of the Congress. But if it\r\nbe true that the movement could not have been started by an Indian or by\r\nthe combined efforts of many Indians, all we can say is that that itself\r\nwould be proof of its having been started before time and on wrong\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\nHad not Mr. Hume said that “whether in the individual or the nation, all\r\nvital progress must spring from within,” and that it was “to her own\r\nsons that the country must look for the initiative?” Did not Mr. Hume\r\nsay in his manifesto of 1883 that “in vain may aliens like myself love\r\nIndia ... in vain may they struggle and sacrifice ... they may assist\r\nwith advice and suggestion, but they lack the _essential_ of\r\nnationality, and the real work must ever be done by the people of the\r\ncountry themselves?”\r\n\r\nThese may be only truisms, but they are fundamental and any political\r\neffort made in defiance of them must be futile and impotent. The Indian\r\nleaders of the Congress have never fully realised the absolute truth of\r\nthese principles and the result is the comparatively poor record of the\r\nCongress. In his original manifesto issued in 1883, Mr. Hume wanted\r\nfifty Indians “with sufficient power of self-sacrifice, sufficient love\r\nfor and pride in their country, sufficient genuine and unselfish\r\nheartfelt patriotism to take the initiative and if needs be to devote\r\nthe rest of their lives to the cause.”\r\n\r\nOf course there were many times fifty men of that kind in the country,\r\neven then, who were devoting their lives to the service of their\r\ncountry, but not in the political line. It took the Congress and the\r\ncountry, by working on Congress lines, more than twenty years to produce\r\nfifty, many times fifty, such men to devote their lives to the political\r\ncause. But unfortunately these are neither in the Congress, nor of the\r\nCongress. Barring Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji and the late Mr. Gokhale, who\r\namong the living Congress leaders can be said to have devoted their\r\nlives, in the way Mr. Hume wanted them to do, to the Congress cause?\r\nWithin the last thirty years India has produced many noble sons who have\r\ngiven their all in the service of the Motherland. They come from all\r\nprovinces, all religions, all denominations, and all castes. But very\r\nfew of them have ever been active in the Congress or for the Congress.\r\nWithin the same period many Indians have given away many hundreds of\r\nthousands of rupees, some the whole earnings of a lifetime, in aid of\r\neducation or for other public or charitable purposes; but the Congress\r\nwork has always languished for want of funds. The British Committee of\r\nthe Indian National Congress, located in London, have never had\r\nsufficient money to do their work decently. The expenses of the British\r\nCommittee have largely fallen on Sir William Wedderburn. He and Mr. Hume\r\nbetween them spent quite a fortune on the movement. No single Indian is\r\nsaid to have spent even a fraction of that. The question naturally\r\narises,--why has it been so? The answer is obvious. The movement did not\r\nappeal to the nation. The leaders lacked that faith which alone makes it\r\npossible to make great sacrifices for it.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of the Congress there was a great deal of enthusiasm\r\nfor it among the English educated Indians. So long as no attempts were\r\nmade to reach the masses and carry on the propaganda among the people,\r\nthe officials expressed their sympathy with the movement. Lord Dufferin\r\neven invited the members as “distinguished visitors” to a garden party\r\nat Government House, Calcutta, when the Congress held its second session\r\nin that city in 1886. In 1887 the Governor of Madras paid a similar\r\ncompliment to them at Madras,[59] but in 1888 when Mr. Hume adopted the\r\nmethods and tactics of the Corn-Law Leaguers of England, down came the\r\nhand of the Government; and then the Congress movement at once adopted\r\nan apologetic tone and abandoned the only method by which it could make\r\nitself heard with effect. Why? Because, in the words of Mr. Hume, there\r\nwere no “_men_ who could act.”\r\n\r\n_The Congress Lacked Essentials of a National Movement._ Ever since then\r\nthe Congress has cared more for the opinion of the Government and the\r\nofficials than for truth or for the interests of the country. Again the\r\nquestion arises, why? And the reply is, because the leaders had neither\r\nsufficient political consciousness nor faith. They had certain political\r\nopinions, but not beliefs for which they were willing to suffer. They\r\nwere prepared to urge the desirability of certain reforms in the\r\ngovernment of the country, even at the risk of a certain amount of\r\nofficial displeasure, but they were not prepared to bear persecutions,\r\nor suffer for their cause. Either they did not know they had a cause,\r\nor they were wanting in that earnestness which makes men suffer for a\r\ncause. Or, to be charitable, they thought that the country was not\r\nprepared for an intense movement and considered it better to have\r\nsomething than nothing. They perhaps wanted to educate the country in\r\npolitical methods and bring about a political consolidation of all the\r\nnational forces, before undertaking an intensified movement. But with\r\nthe greatest possible respect for the founders of the Indian National\r\nCongress, or for those who a few years ago took up the control of the\r\nmovement, we cannot help remarking that by their own conduct they showed\r\nthat their movement lacked the essentials of a national movement.\r\n\r\nA movement does not become national by the mere desire of its founders\r\nto make it so. In the opinion of the writer it is a mistake to start a\r\n_national political movement_ unless those who start it are prepared to\r\nmake great sacrifices for it. A halting, half-hearted political movement\r\ndepending on the sympathy and good will of the very class against whom\r\nit is directed, consulting their wishes at every step, with its founders\r\nor leaders trembling for their safety and keeping their purse strings\r\ntight, only doing as much as the authorities would allow and as would\r\nnot interfere in any way with their own personal interests and comforts\r\nand incomes, is from its very nature detrimental to real national\r\ninterests. A political movement is mischievous in its effects if its\r\nleaders do not put a sufficient amount of earnestness into it to evoke\r\ngreat enthusiasm among their followers, such as would prepare them for\r\ngreat sacrifices for the cause on the one hand, and on the other,\r\nproduce a certain amount of fear of unpleasant consequences in those\r\nagainst whom it is directed. For this it is necessary that the leaders\r\nshould be prepared to suffer for the cause. The sacrifice of money is\r\nthe least proof of earnestness which a believer in any cause can give.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that the English friends of the movement showed more\r\nearnestness than many of the Indian leaders. They spent their own money\r\nover it and they incurred the displeasure of their countrymen and the\r\nodium of being called traitors to their own country. Mr. Hume was “in\r\ndeadly earnest.” He started the movement with the good will of the\r\nauthorities and waited for results for two years. When, however, he\r\nfound that “the platonic expressions of sympathy by the authorities were\r\na mockery,” that nothing was done to lessen the “misery of the masses”\r\nand to relieve their sufferings and redress their grievances, he decided\r\nto put more intensity into the movement. He undertook to instruct the\r\nIndian nation and rouse them to a sense of their right and to a sense of\r\nthe wrong that was being done to them. In his opinion, “the case was one\r\nof extreme urgency, for the deaths by famine and pestilence were counted\r\nnot by tens of thousands or by hundreds of thousands, but by\r\nmillions.”[60] He concluded that “in order to _constrain the Government_\r\nto move, the leaders of the Indian people must adopt measures of\r\nexceptional vigour, following the drastic methods pursued in England by\r\nBright and Cobden in their great campaign on behalf of the people’s\r\nfood.” So, like Cobden, Hume decided that since the attempt of the\r\nCongress leaders to instruct the Government had failed and since the\r\nGovernment had refused to be instructed by them, the next step was “to\r\ninstruct the nations, the great English nation in its island home, _and\r\nalso the far greater nation_ of this vast Indian continent, so that\r\nevery Indian that breathes upon the sacred soil of this our motherland,\r\nshall become our comrade and coadjutor, our supporter and if need be\r\n_our soldier, in the great war that we, like Cobden and his noble band,\r\nwill wage for justice, for our liberties and our rights_.”[61]\r\n\r\n_Hume’s Political Movement._ Now these were noble words, pointing out\r\nthe only political weapon that ever succeeds against autocratic\r\ngovernments. We are told by Mr. Hume’s biographer that “in pursuance of\r\nsuch a propaganda in India, Mr. Hume set to work with his wonted energy,\r\nappealing for funds to all classes of the Indian community, distributing\r\ntracts, leaflets and pamphlets, sending out lecturers and calling\r\nmeetings both in large towns and in country districts. Throughout the\r\ncountry over one thousand meetings were held, at many of which over five\r\nthousand persons were present, and arrangements were made for the\r\ndistribution of half a million pamphlets, translations into twelve\r\nIndian languages being circulated of two remarkable pamphlets, showing\r\nby a parable the necessary evils of absentee state landlordism, however\r\nbenevolent the intention.”[62]\r\n\r\nThat was true political work, done with a real political insight. If it\r\nhad been persevered in, the history of the Congress would have been\r\ndifferent and perhaps the revolutionary party would never have been born\r\nor would have been born earlier. In either case the country would have\r\nbeen farther ahead in politics than it is now. What, however, actually\r\nhappened was that the Government was at once moved to hostility. Lord\r\nDufferin spoke of the Congress in terms of contempt “as the\r\ninfinitesimal minority,” at a Calcutta dinner. Sir Auckland Colvin\r\nstirred up the Mohammedans, organised an Anti-Congress Association and\r\ndenounced the Congress in no measured terms, as mischievous, disloyal,\r\nand much before the time.\r\n\r\n_Congress Overawed._ Mr. Hume started to explain in an apologetic tone.\r\nIt was at this time that he came out with the “safety valve” theory. The\r\npropaganda was at once abandoned, never to be resumed in the history of\r\nthe movement. The movement in England failed for want of funds. The\r\nmovement in India collapsed for want of perseverance, vigour and\r\nearnestness. Here again we are disposed to think that Mr. Hume’s\r\nsubsequent conduct was influenced more by the fears and half-heartedness\r\nof the Indian leaders than by his own judgment. If the Indian leaders\r\nhad stuck to their guns and pushed on their propaganda, the country\r\nwould have supplied funds and would have rallied round them. Perhaps\r\nthere might have been a few riots and a few prosecutions. But that would\r\nhave drawn the attention of the British public to Indian conditions more\r\neffectively than their twenty-eight years of half-hearted propaganda in\r\nEngland did. The political education of the people would have been more\r\nrapid and the movement would have gained such a strength as to make\r\nitself irresistible. It is possible, nay, probable, that the Government\r\nwould have suppressed the movement. But that itself would have been a\r\nvictory and a decided and effective step in the political education of\r\nthe people. The revolutionary movement would have come earlier and the\r\nGovernment would have seen the wisdom of conciliating the moderates much\r\nearlier than 1909. What was given to us in 1909 might have been given\r\ntwenty years earlier. The Mohammedans would have been happy to get in\r\n1889 what they got in 1909. The Indian leaders, however, thought that\r\nthey were not sufficiently strong and that the movement stood the chance\r\nof being suppressed. They gave in and abandoned the only effective\r\nweapon they had forged to get redress of political grievances.\r\n\r\nNo nation and no political party can ever be strong enough to make their\r\nvoice effective, unless and until they put forward a sufficient amount\r\nof _earnestness_ (not bluff) to convince their opponents that in case\r\ntheir demands are trifled with, the consequences might be serious to\r\nboth parties. The history of political advance in self-governed\r\ncountries like England, Germany, France, etc., amply proves this. No\r\npolitical agitation need be started unless those who are engaged in it\r\nare prepared to back it by the power of the purse and the power of\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\n_Congress Agitation in England._ The Congress overawed in 1888 and 1889,\r\nfailed in both respects. So far as the first is concerned, why, that has\r\nbeen a theme of lamentation, appeals, and wailings from year to year.\r\nFriends in England, whether in or outside the British Committee, have\r\nlamented it in pathetic terms. The Congress agitation in England has\r\nnever been effective. The Congress has had precious little influence on\r\nEnglish public opinion, and although the British Committee of the\r\nCongress have had an office and an organ in London for the last 25 years\r\nor more, their influence in English politics has been almost nil. But\r\nfor the generosity of Mr. Hume and Sir William Wedderburn, the Congress\r\noffice in London might have been long ago closed. The leaders of the\r\nCongress have talked very much of their implicit faith in the English\r\nnation; they have held out hopes of our getting a redress of our wrongs\r\nif we could only inform the British people of the condition of things\r\nprevalent in India; yet the efforts they have put forward to achieve\r\nthat end have been puerile and paltry. There is a party of Indian\r\npoliticians who do not believe in agitation in England, but the leaders\r\nof the Congress and those who have controlled the organisation in the\r\nlast 30 years do not profess to belong to that party. We shall now try\r\nto explain why this has been so.\r\n\r\n_Causes of Failure of the Congress._ (1). The movement was neither\r\ninspired by the people nor devised or planned by them. It was a movement\r\nnot _from within_. No section of the Indian people identified themselves\r\nwith it so completely as to feel that their existence as honourable men\r\ndepended on its successful management. The movement was started by an\r\nEnglishman, at the suggestion of an English pro-consul. The Indians, who\r\nprofessed to lead it, were either actually in government service or in\r\nprofessions allied to government service and created by the Government.\r\nA good many of the latter aspired to offices under the Government or to\r\na recognition of their merit and public spirit by the Government. They\r\nwere patriotic enough to give a part of their time and energy to the\r\nmovement, so long as it did not clash with their own interests, so long\r\nas they were not required to mar their careers for it, or so long as it\r\ndid not demand heavy sacrifices from them. We do not question either\r\ntheir motives or their patriotism, but it was not sufficiently intense\r\nto induce them to stake their _all_ on it.\r\n\r\n(2). The movement lacked the essentials of a popular movement. The\r\nleaders were not in touch with the people. Perhaps they did not even\r\nwant to come in touch with them. Their propaganda was confined to a few\r\nEnglish-educated persons, was carried on in English and was meant for\r\nthe ears of the authorities rather than for the people. The leaders\r\nalways felt shy of the masses, made no efforts to reach them, and\r\nsystematically discouraged the younger men from doing the same. Some of\r\nthem have openly opposed efforts in this direction.\r\n\r\n(3). The leaders failed to inspire enthusiasm among the people, either\r\nby their own failure to make sacrifices, or by the triviality of their\r\nsacrifices. Their ordinary life, their income, their prosperity, and\r\ntheir luxuries were in no way affected by the movement. There were only\r\ntwo exceptions to this, viz., Dadabhai Naoroji and Gokhale. The\r\nsacrifices of Messrs. Hume and Wedderburn shamed the people, but failed\r\nto appeal to their imagination. In fact, they roused the anger of the\r\npeople against the leaders and created distrust. The spectacle of\r\nleaders accepting high offices they were offered under the Government\r\nadded to this distrust.\r\n\r\n(4). The movement was neither confined to a select few, nor open to all.\r\nWhile the people were expected to add to the spectacular side of the\r\nshow by their presence in large numbers, by crowded meetings, by cheers\r\nand applause, they were never given a hand in the movement. Differences\r\nof opinion were always discouraged and free discussion was never\r\nallowed. It was neither a public forum, nor a private meeting of the\r\nselect few. In the latter case it would have been less expensive and\r\nwould have saved money for work in England. In the former case it would\r\nhave been more effective.\r\n\r\n(5). A national movement, demanding only a few concessions and not\r\nspeaking of the liberties of the nation and of its ideals, is never an\r\neffective movement. It is at best an opportunist movement. It is\r\nmischievous in so far as it diverts attention from substantial _nation\r\nbuilding_ and _character making_. It brings fame without sacrifice. It\r\nopens opportunities for treacheries and hypocrisies. It enables some\r\npeople to trade in the name of patriotism. No political movement can be\r\nentirely free from these disadvantages, but the greatest mischief which\r\na political movement lightly handled and led does, is that it delays the\r\ndevelopment of the people on normal lines by raising hopes which are\r\nbaseless and can never be realised by means recommended and methods\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III. THE BIRTH OF THE NEW NATIONALIST MOVEMENT\r\n\r\nThe National Movement in India continued on its placid and humdrum\r\ncourse until Lord Curzon’s ridicule of the movement convinced the people\r\nthat the political methods of the Congress were quite powerless to bring\r\nthem any relief against the despotism that trampled upon all their\r\nrights and sensibilities. This led to a deeper and a closer study of the\r\npolitical problem on the part of men who had convictions as\r\ndistinguished from opinions, who had faith as against opportunism, who\r\nwanted a soul for their people, rather than a few more posts under the\r\nGovernment. They discovered that the movement had suffered not only by\r\nthe adoption of wrong methods and by want of sacrifice on the part of\r\nleaders, but by their failure to grasp principles and to formulate\r\nideals. Hence the cry of _Swadeshi_ and _Swaraj_.[63]\r\n\r\n_Swadeshi and Swaraj._ No sooner was the cry raised than the country was\r\nswept by a wave of political activity which deeply and intimately\r\ninfluenced the proceedings of the Congress in 1905 and 1906. Calcutta\r\nmight have witnessed in 1906 what Surat did in 1907, but for the\r\nsagacity and patriotism of Dadabhai, who rose equal to the occasion and\r\nblessed the cry for self-government. He declared in the words of Sir\r\nHenry Campbell-Bannerman, the British Premier, that good government\r\ncould never be a substitute for self-government. So far good government\r\nhad been the ideal of the Congress. At the Calcutta session of 1906 it\r\nwas changed to self-government,--and from the mouth of a man who had\r\ndevoted his whole life to the political cause. That is the date of the\r\nbirth of the real National Movement in India.\r\n\r\nThe _Surat Fiasco_[64] was, among other causes, brought about by the\r\nfear that the so-called moderate leaders wanted to go back past what had\r\nbeen done in 1906. There is no doubt that they had gone back in spirit,\r\nthough perhaps not in letter. The enthusiasm, created by popular\r\npropaganda of the Congress in 1888, was killed by the reaction that\r\nfollowed in subsequent years. The same thing would have happened in 1907\r\nbut for the fact that this time the movement was sufficiently intense\r\nto claim its martyrs.\r\n\r\nThe high ideals embodied in Swadeshi and Swaraj were the ideals worked\r\nout by the sons of India: the miseries of the motherland had given an\r\nimpetus to the idea, but the idea itself stood on higher ground. It was\r\nnot the redress of grievances that filled the mind of the people, but\r\nthe desire for liberty. It was not concessions they wanted, but liberty.\r\nLiberty is not a thing of the earth, and therefore it can neither be\r\ngiven nor accepted as a gift. It has to be won. People felt that, and\r\nwere prepared to realise that in their lives.\r\n\r\nAfter more than twenty years of more or less futile agitation for\r\nconcessions and redress of grievances, they had received stones in place\r\nof bread. Lord Ripon was succeeded by a Curzon. People saw that a sort\r\nof mist, a deep, covering fog, had prevented them from seeing ahead.\r\nThey had been wandering in pursuit of vain things. The haven had been\r\nconcealed from their vision and the result was that their tiny bark had\r\nbeen following a wrong course. The waters were stormy and the sea was\r\nheavy, but no ship could reach its destination unless the mariners and\r\nsailors in charge knew what their goal was, and unless they were\r\nprepared to put forth all they had in them to carry the bark through. So\r\nfar, the bark had been sailing under misleading stars, without a compass\r\nto guide the captain. Now the compass was found and with the finding of\r\nthe compass the aspect changed. Ideas inspire men. Ideals prepare them\r\nto breast martyrdom. The ideal of Swaraj found men ready to suffer for\r\nit, to meet death like martyrs. The new movement has inspired a class of\r\nmen whose life is filled with that idea and that idea alone. They are\r\nthe worshippers of Swaraj; they love their motherland above everything\r\nelse. They do not want office, or incomes, or recognition, or applause.\r\nWhat they want is liberty, not for themselves, because that they might\r\nget perhaps by settling in other countries, but for their beloved\r\ncountry. High Court Judgeships, Civil Service, Councils, mean nothing to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe founders of the Indian National Congress began their movement under\r\ninspiration of government and under the shadow of the high offices they\r\nheld or aspired to under that government, but the founders and inspirers\r\nof the National Movement started their propaganda by boycotting\r\ngovernment and government patronage. The former wanted high offices, the\r\nlatter despised those who held them. The former asked for concessions,\r\nthe latter rejected them. The former wanted Councils, the latter would\r\nhave nothing to do with them. The former appealed to the British\r\nGovernment and the British nation, the latter appealed to their own\r\npeople and to their own patriotism and to their God. The former were led\r\nby the British, the latter by pure Indians. The former would not do\r\nanything which would mar their careers, the latter threw away their\r\nchances like poisoned bread. The former lived in bungalows, revelled in\r\ndrawing rooms, velvet-covered chairs, were attended by liveried\r\nservants, ate at well-furnished tables, entertained governors and\r\nmagistrates; the latter gave up even the little comforts they had,\r\nchanged trousers for _dhotis_, coats for _chapkans_ or _kurtas_\r\n(shirts), overcoats for blankets, and boots for ordinary Swadeshi shoes.\r\nThe former owed their prosperity in life, their positions, and their\r\ncomforts, to the British system, and were therefore under obligation to\r\nthe British; but the latter chose the path of poverty and destitution to\r\navoid obligations. They threw away their chances deliberately and with\r\nthe conviction that that was the right thing to do. The former cared for\r\nwines, for children, and for home. The latter gave up all, to devote\r\nthemselves completely to the cause and to the motherland. The former had\r\nproduced only two full time workers for the cause in the course of 22\r\nyears, the latter produced virtually hundreds and thousands in less than\r\ntwo years. The former worked under the best auspices, the latter started\r\ntheir work under overhanging clouds, which soon burst and swept away\r\nmany of them into prisons.\r\n\r\nIs it any wonder that under such inspiration the movement spread like\r\nwildfire and assumed wide proportions? Life met life. Forces met forces.\r\nConflict and clash resulted in fatal accidents to either party. The\r\ncasualties on the side of the Nationalists have been tremendously heavy\r\nand out of all proportion to their number, but judging the conflict by\r\nthe resources, no one need hesitate in saying that the moral victory\r\nlies with the Nationalists. Within less than five years of their\r\npropaganda, they forced the hand of the Government to make concessions\r\nwhich could not be even thought of in 1905. The Congress leaders claim\r\ncredit for themselves and so does the Government; but the verdict of\r\nimpartial and unbiased historians will be otherwise.\r\n\r\nLord Morley would rally the moderates because there were extremists in\r\nthe land. In the absence of the so-called extremists, the moderates were\r\nextremists and the Government and its agents looked down upon them. The\r\nAnglo-Indian statesman and his confidant, the moderate Congress leader,\r\nsay that the extremists are few, that most of them are those\r\ngood-for-nothings, who could do nothing at the universities, or with\r\ntheir lives; that they are maniacs and men who have lost all sense of\r\nright and wrong.\r\n\r\n_Men who have Inspired the Movement._ But look at the men who have\r\ninspired the movement, some of whom are leading it even to-day. Is\r\nArabinda Ghosh a failure? Is Har Dayal a failure? Were the nine\r\ndeportees from Bengal failures? How many high-class graduates have been\r\nhanged; how many are in jail! Look at their university records and look\r\nat their prospects, and then say if you can call them “malcontents” or\r\nmen who have arisen against the Government because they could not\r\nprosper under it. Their propaganda has compelled the Government to adopt\r\nthe severest repressive measures open to a foreign government. The penal\r\ncode has been amended to make the definition of sedition more\r\ncomprehensive. The criminal procedure code has been amended to\r\nfacilitate convictions and to accelerate trials. Provisions have been\r\nadded to enable magistrates to award summary imprisonment for failure to\r\ngive security for good behaviour asked for on political grounds. A\r\nSeditious Meetings Act has been enacted to make open propaganda\r\nimpossible. An Explosives Act has been placed on the statute book. A\r\nPress Law has been passed to muzzle the press. Spies and detectives have\r\nbeen employed out of number. Teachers, professors, friends, pupils,\r\nclass-fellows, parents, have all been requisitioned to crush the\r\nmovement. The number of publications confiscated under the Press Act,\r\nthe convictions for sedition, for seditious murders, for dacoities and\r\nfor keeping arms, the sentences for failure to find securities for good\r\nbehaviour, all continue to grow. The cry is, “Still they come!” In\r\nprisons the political prisoner has been subjected to horrible treatment;\r\none committed suicide and another lost his senses in the Andamans. Many\r\na tale of misery and wretchedness, of torture and of insults comes from\r\nthe prisons in India, but still the movement is far from being crushed.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence that new recruits join the secret propaganda every\r\nyear and take the place of those hanged or imprisoned. A number has\r\nexiled themselves and are carrying on their propaganda in distant lands\r\nunder very discouraging and depressing circumstances. The man who says\r\nthat the movement is dead or dying must be a liar or a fool. The\r\nmovement is alive and possibly as vigorous as it ever was. It has\r\ncaptured the imagination of the younger generation. And at least 75 per\r\ncent. of the students in India and in England sympathise with this\r\nparty. Almost all are Anti-Congress. Even those who are not Nationalists\r\ndo not like the Congress and feel no obligation towards it, because the\r\nCongress failed to communicate high principles and lay down high ideals,\r\nand because it failed to create that spirit of self-sacrifice, that\r\nwillingness to suffer, without which no national movement can grow,\r\nprosper, and inspire.\r\n\r\nThe failures of the Congress evolved the Nationalist Movement. The\r\nCongress did its work that way. It brought conviction home that no\r\namount of prayers, resolutions, protests, memorials, could move the\r\nautocratic bureaucracy in India, and no amount of petitions were likely\r\nto make any impression upon the people in England. The fact that the\r\nCongress leaders would not make sacrifices for the Congress cause,\r\nthough they would give large amounts of money for educational purposes\r\nand other charities, forced people to think that they themselves had no\r\nfaith in the Congress propaganda or in the Congress methods, though they\r\nlacked the courage to say so or to change their methods. It was perhaps\r\nunreasonable to expect that of the kind of men that led the Congress.\r\nMost of them loved their country and were public spirited; they had\r\ngiven proof of it, good and sufficient, in other sides of national\r\nactivity, in the cause of social reform, in the cause of public\r\neducation, in industrial propaganda. Outside the Congress they have done\r\nenough to create an atmosphere which was bound to bring about the\r\ndevelopment of the political movement along the lines on which it\r\neventually did develop in 1905.\r\n\r\nThe Nationalist child was, so to say, brought up on the lap of the old\r\nCongress man and fed on the food provided by him; though, strange\r\nenough, this bringing up and this feeding produced results for which the\r\nCongressman was not prepared and which shocked him a bit. The first\r\nshock over, some of them were happy to have lived to see the day, and\r\nblessed the movement. Some made up their minds to throttle it, but soon\r\nfound that it was not in their power to do so. The worst they could do\r\nwas to condemn it and to denounce it. All they could achieve was to cut\r\nthe new movement, shake off all responsibility for it, and thus secure\r\ntheir own safety. We do not say that they did it to save their skins.\r\nBut fortunately for them their convictions led them the way their safety\r\nlay. In their heart of hearts they blessed the new movement and were\r\nheartily glad that it came. It acted and reacted on their own movement.\r\nIt made it possible for them to put strength and force into their\r\ndemands for concessions. Whenever an extremist leader recanted or used\r\ncompromising language, they were sorry. They wanted the movement to\r\ncontinue and to live, though they would not join it and though they\r\nbelieved that it was harmful to the country in some respects. They\r\ndeplore the lack of enthusiasm and sacrifice in their own ranks, but\r\nthey admire the selflessness of the extremists and respect their real\r\nleaders. An Arabinda Ghosh and a Tilak simply compel their admiration\r\nand respect. Whatever the shortcomings of Har Dayal may be, he is a\r\nunique personality.\r\n\r\nWe have stated wherein the new movement differed from the old, and we\r\nhave also stated what its dominant note is. We would now like to examine\r\nhow it intended to proceed and how its hands were forced to do the\r\nthings it has done since.\r\n\r\n_Lord Curzon and Indian Education._ We have already hinted that Lord\r\nCurzon’s policy and his utterances helped a great deal in the birth of\r\nthe new movement. When Lord Curzon came to India, he formulated a rather\r\nambitious programme of reforms to be introduced into the administration\r\nof the country. One of these reforms related to education.\r\n\r\nEvery one in the country, who has had anything to do with education in\r\nIndia, was of opinion that the country was very backward in education\r\nand that the system of education there in vogue was defective. It laid\r\ntoo great stress on the literary side and did not fit people for the\r\nbattle of life; it gave undue importance to the English language and\r\nWestern modes of thought, at the cost of the vernaculars and the\r\nindigenous civilisation of the country; it encouraged “cram” at the cost\r\nof real merit; it produced a class of imitators and left little scope or\r\nnone for originality; it invited third class men from England to fill\r\nthe highest positions in the educational service of the country, and\r\nplaced the best native intellect and talent under them to starve and rot\r\nfor want of opportunities; it did not recognise the duty of the\r\nGovernment to look after the education of the child from the beginning\r\nuntil he was fit to fight his own way in the world.\r\n\r\nThe educational system of the country required radical changes, but what\r\nwas most needed was that the Government should be prepared to spend\r\nadequate sums of money for its spread and in order to make it efficient.\r\nLord Curzon’s pronouncements and programme therefore raised great hopes\r\nin the minds of the people. His University Commission was simply flooded\r\nwith suggestions and statements from Indians and Anglo-Indians. The two\r\nclasses, however, discussed the matter from entirely different\r\nstandpoints: The Indians wanted greater facilities for education, more\r\nschools, more colleges, more masters, more stipends, an extension of\r\nprimary school education, abler and better-paid teachers, freedom of\r\nprivate enterprise, ample provision for technical and industrial\r\neducation; but what they wanted most and cared for most was that\r\neducation should be more nationalised and humanised. The Anglo-Indians\r\nwanted a curtailment of the educational opportunities, a greater and\r\nstricter control of private enterprise, a raising of university\r\nstandards, and a system of education which would curb the rising\r\ngeneration and make them more easily amenable to discipline and\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\nLord Curzon did go into all these questions, but the decision arrived at\r\nconvinced the educated Indians that the motive which underlay Lord\r\nCurzon’s policy was the tightening of government control, the strangling\r\nof all independence in matters educational, and the eventual weakening\r\nof all national movement and national sentiment.\r\n\r\n_Lord Curzon’s Secret Educational Conference._ The fact that he admitted\r\nno Indian to the meeting of the Secret Educational Conference held at\r\nSimla, when he formulated the government policy, strengthened that idea.\r\nHis University Legislation shocked the country beyond measure and left\r\nno doubt whatsoever that what he aimed at was a complete official\r\ncontrol of all education in India. Educated Indians read between the\r\nlines and concluded that it was a mistake to look to the Government to\r\ndo things or to follow a policy which might quicken the national pulse,\r\nstrengthen the Nationalist sentiment, or add to the efficiency of the\r\npeople so as to fit them to stand on their legs and desire to get rid of\r\nthe leading strings in which they were held by the British.\r\n\r\n_Indians and Lord Curzon at Cross Purposes._ Indians saw that they and\r\nLord Curzon were at cross-purposes. They aimed at self-government and\r\nfreedom; Lord Curzon aimed at prolongation of the period of their\r\nbondage and the permanence of the existing political conditions. We\r\nwanted independence; he wanted us to be dependent on the British. We\r\nwanted to quicken the pace of national advance; he wanted to slacken it.\r\nWe wanted to be assertive and self-reliant; he wanted us to be\r\nsubmissive and in permanent control and tutelage. We wanted to go\r\nforward, he mistrusted us. We wanted a policy of honest confidence;\r\ninstead of that he inaugurated a policy of suspicion. We wanted unity,\r\nhe proceeded to bring into existence fresh causes of friction between\r\ncommunity and community. We wanted the marshalling of our forces in the\r\ncommon cause, he proceeded to divide us and to keep us apart. We wanted\r\nconsolidation, and he started active disintegration. We wanted an\r\nextension of representative government, Lord Curzon did his best to\r\ndiscredit the institutions that had been granted and to set back the\r\nhands of the clock.\r\n\r\n_The Congress Deputation to England in 1905._ The leaders of the Indian\r\nNational Congress saw all this; they resisted Lord Curzon’s policy\r\nrather boldly; they spoke with courage; they sought his patronage and\r\nsent their president to wait on him. Lord Curzon refused to see him and\r\nthus slapped the Congress in the face. He characterised their activities\r\nas the letting off of “gas.” Their resolutions he looked upon with\r\ncontempt because, as he said, nothing had ever come out of them. The\r\nleaders felt offended, they fretted and foamed. But all they resolved to\r\ndo was to appeal to the British public. So a deputation was sent to\r\nEngland in 1905 to place the grievances of India before the British\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nThis deputation was composed of Messrs. Gokhale and the writer of this\r\nbook. They addressed a large number of meetings in Great Britain, made\r\nmany friends, saw some politicians; but they were not very hopeful as to\r\nthe results. One of them on his return (the present writer) struck an\r\nunmistakable note of despondency. He frankly told his people that the\r\nBritish democracy was too busy with their own affairs to do anything for\r\nthem, that the British press was not willing to champion Indian\r\naspirations, that it was hard to get a hearing in England, and that the\r\ninfluence and the credit of the Anglo-Indians was too strong to be met\r\nsuccessfully by the necessarily inadequate agitation which the Congress\r\ncould set up in England. On his return to India the message which he\r\nbrought to his people was, that if they really cared for their country,\r\nthey would have to strike the blow for freedom themselves, and that they\r\nwould have to furnish unmistakable proofs of their earnestness.\r\n\r\nHis message was in no way different from what Mr. Hume had told the\r\ngraduates of the Calcutta University in 1883, or in his pamphlets “The\r\nStar in the East” and the “Old Man’s Hope.”\r\n\r\n_The Congress of 1905._ This was the first time that an Indian publicist\r\nhad spoken in that strain. The _swadeshi_ and _boycott_ had already been\r\nstarted in Bengal during his absence from India. Even Mr. Gokhale\r\napproved of the boycott as a political weapon. So the message which he\r\nbrought fell on willing and sympathetic ears. The country was in a mood\r\nto listen to it, and it did listen. The Congress Session of 1905, held\r\nat Benares,[65] gave an opportunity for comparing notes and for settling\r\na programme. The reception accorded to Mr. Gokhale and the rather\r\nuproarious meetings of the Subjects Committee afforded ample evidence of\r\nthe temper of the people. Gokhale was cautious, careful, but\r\nenthusiastic. His presidential address was inspiring, though strictly\r\nmoderate. His Bombay friends, however, would not let him go sufficiently\r\nfar. The very first night the Subjects Committee sat, it appeared that a\r\nsplit was inevitable and the proceedings could not be as unanimous and\r\nharmonious as was customary. The old Congress leaders were accustomed to\r\nunanimity, but the younger generation soon convinced them that unanimity\r\non the old lines was impossible.\r\n\r\nWhen the meeting of the Subjects Committee broke up after its\r\ndeliberation on the first night, no unanimity had been reached with\r\nregard to a resolution welcoming the visit of the Prince of Wales (the\r\npresent King) to India. The dissentionists threatened to oppose it in\r\nthe Congress. The reception committee and the older leaders were all\r\nfurious, threatened all sorts of retributions, and predicted all sorts\r\nof evil consequences, but the younger men would not listen. The whole of\r\nthe morning was spent in efforts to induce them to withdraw their\r\nopposition, but young Bengal refused to agree. The meeting was delayed;\r\nGokhale then made a personal appeal to the Mahratta and the Punjab\r\nleaders, and they prevailed on their Bengalee friends to absent\r\nthemselves from the meeting and let the resolution be passed in their\r\nabsence. The resolution relating to Swadeshi,[66] boycott, and national\r\neducation, again evoked lively discussion resulting in compromise,\r\nwherein the principles for which the Nationalists stood were conceded.\r\n\r\nIn the Congress camp, the younger generation had met in open conference\r\nto discuss their future programme. It was then that Mr. Tilak gave out\r\nthe idea of passive resistance. No formal resolutions were passed, but\r\nthe better mind of the people present decided to inaugurate an era of\r\nself-help and self-reliance based on an active boycott of government\r\nservice and of the semi-government institutions.\r\n\r\n_Object of the Passive Resistance Movement._ The object was two-fold.\r\n(1). To destroy the hypnotism that had caused the people and the country\r\nto have faith not only in the omnipotence of their rulers, but also in\r\ntheir altruism. In the words of one of the leaders of the Nationalist\r\nthought (Babu B. C. Pal,[67] “The Spirit of Indian Nationalism,” page\r\n42), the people had been hypnotised to believe in the altruism of their\r\nforeign rulers:\r\n\r\n“Untrained in the crooked ways of civilised diplomacy, they had believed\r\nwhat their rulers had said, either of themselves or of their subjects,\r\nas gospel truth. They had been told that the people of India were\r\nunfitted to manage their own affairs, and they believed it to be true.\r\nThey had been told that the people were weak and the Government was\r\nstrong. They had been told that India stood on a lower plane of humanity\r\nand England’s mission was to civilise ‘the semi-barbarous native.’ The\r\nNationalist school took it upon themselves to expose the hollowness of\r\nall these pretensions. They commenced to make what are called\r\ncounter-passes in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAL GANGA DHAR TILAK]\r\n\r\nhypnotism, and at once awoke the people to a sense of their own\r\nstrength, an appreciation of their own culture.”\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the object was to create a passionate love of\r\nliberty, accompanied by a spirit of sacrifice and readiness to suffer\r\nfor the cause of the country. This was to be done more by example than\r\nprecept. What the programme was may better be stated in the words of the\r\nleader whom we have quoted above:\r\n\r\n“Boycott both economic and political, boycott of foreign and especially\r\nBritish goods, and of all honorary associations with the administration,\r\nnational education implying a withdrawal of the youths of the nation\r\nfrom the officialised universities and government-controlled schools and\r\ncolleges, and training them up in institutions conducted on _national_\r\nlines subject to _national_ control and calculated to help the\r\nrealisation of the _national_ destiny, national civic volunteering,\r\naiming at imparting a healthy civic training to the people by the\r\nvoluntary assumption of as much of the civic duties, at present\r\ndischarged by official or semi-official agencies, as could be done\r\nwithout any violation of the existing laws of the country,--duties, for\r\ninstance, in regard to rural sanitation, economic and medical relief,\r\npopular education, preventive police duties, regulation of fair and\r\npilgrim gathering,--settlement of civil and non-cognisable, criminal\r\ndisputes by means of arbitration committees:--these were the proclaimed\r\nmethods of the Nationalist school.”\r\n\r\nAs to the objects of this scheme, we will again quote the same writer:\r\n\r\n“The evident object was to create in the first place a strong civic\r\nsentiment in the people with the help of co-operative organisations for\r\nthe furtherance of the common good, and thus to train them gradually for\r\nthe larger and heavier responsibilities of free citizenship, and in the\r\nnext place, to cover the whole country with a net-work of active,\r\npolitical organisations which would place the leaders in direct and\r\nliving touch with the people, and enable them to bring, from time to\r\ntime, the irresistible pressure of organised public opinion to bear upon\r\nthe Government, helping thereby the gradual expansion of popular\r\nrights.”\r\n\r\nNow it should be noted here in passing, that with the exception of\r\nboycott and volunteering, every other item in the above propaganda had\r\nbeen more or less tried and with varying success in all parts of the\r\ncountry, but more particularly in the Punjab and Maharashtra before\r\nthis. The Deccan education Society and the Poona Fergusson College were\r\nthe offshoots of the desire to further the cause of education by\r\nself-imposed sacrifices, with the underlying motives of quickening the\r\npatriotic impulse and the Nationalist spirit. Similarly Swadeshi,\r\nco-operative organisations, and private arbitration courts had been\r\nthought of and tried. The motives underlying these attempts were\r\nabsolutely patriotic, combining an element of philanthropy in them. The\r\nprivate colleges in Bengal, started by Vidyasagar and others, were also\r\ndue to the same impulse, and so was the Pachaipiya College at Madras.\r\nBombay had its own schemes and was ahead of the rest of India in purely\r\nIndian industrial and trade organisations. Similarly in the Punjab the\r\nidea of swadeshi had been started as early as 1877. The motives were\r\neconomic and patriotic. The idea of national education had found\r\nexpression in the D. A. V. (Dayanand Anglo-Vedic) College, and that of\r\nnational co-operative organisations in the “Punjab National Bank,” the\r\n“Bharat Insurance Company” and other joint stock concerns. Religious and\r\nphilanthropic motives had brought into existence the Hindu orphan\r\nmovement, the famine relief movement, and so on. A little volunteering\r\nhad also been attempted in connection with the famine relief movement\r\nand the Kangra earthquake relief movement. Long before 1905, the Punjab\r\nhad a network of privately organised, privately financed, unaided\r\nschools and other charitable institutions, over which the Government had\r\nlittle effective control. Patriotism and philanthropy were the\r\nunderlying motives of these institutions, but _not politics_.[68]\r\n\r\nThe ruling bureaucracy did not quite like these activities, but they\r\ncould not suppress them. Individual officers sometimes sympathised and\r\neven helped these movements. So far Bengal had been rather backward in\r\nthe matter of national development on these lines. So, when Lord Curzon\r\nproclaimed the partition of Bengal, attacked the veracity of the\r\norientals in his Calcutta University convocation speech, and on other\r\noccasions called them cowards, windbags, unpractical talkers, and mere\r\nfrothy patriots, the Bengalees awoke to a consciousness of their\r\nweaknesses, and resolved to revenge themselves upon Lord Curzon, and\r\nprove to the world at large that Lord Curzon was a liar. What followed\r\nmay be briefly stated in a separate chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST YEARS OF THE NATIONALIST MOVEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n_Partition of Bengal._ It was on the 16th of October, 1905, that the old\r\nProvince of Bengal was partitioned by Lord Curzon. On that day “immense\r\nnumbers of people in the two divisions of the partitioned province\r\nabstained from lighting their kitchen fire, went about barefooted,\r\nperformed ceremonial baths in rivers or sacred tanks,[69] and tied on\r\none another’s wrist the sacred _rakhi_, a piece of silk or cotton\r\nthread, as a symbol of fraternal or national unity.” On the 7th of\r\nAugust, 1905, the leaders of Bengal, in public meeting assembled, in the\r\nCalcutta Town Hall, under the presidency of Maharaja Mannidra Chandra\r\nNundy of Cossimbazar,[70] had already declared “a general boycott of\r\nBritish goods as a practical protest against the proposed partition.”\r\n\r\n_Boycott of British Goods._ The original idea was to resort to boycott\r\nas a temporary measure, and therefore in the pledges drawn up in the\r\nearly days, a time limit was put in. The boycott was to last until “the\r\npartition was withdrawn.” In the words of a Bengalee politician, the\r\nidea was to cause pecuniary loss to the British manufacturer and thus\r\nenlist his sympathy and help for the purpose of getting the measure\r\ncancelled. But it was soon discovered that the boycott might be an\r\neffective economic weapon, to be used as a measure of protection against\r\nthe economic exploitation of the country by the foreigner.\r\n\r\nTo quote the same writer, “The pledges sent from Calcutta came back,\r\nduly signed by large numbers of people, but with the conditional\r\nsentence, ‘until Partition is withdrawn,’ scored through. The boycott\r\nwas a great success for some time. ‘The Lucky Day’ of October, 1905, on\r\nwhich generally a very large number of forward contracts in Manchester\r\ngoods are made at Calcutta, passed without any business being done.\r\nSimultaneously with this decline in foreign goods, many indigenous\r\nindustries began to revive. There was a boom in handlooms all over\r\nIndia. Provinces outside of Bengal did not adopt a policy of active\r\nboycott, but the cry of Swadeshi[71] was taken up by all the country,\r\nwhereby a great impetus was given to indigenous manufacturers. The\r\nsignificance of the movement in Bengal, where it was rigorously pursued,\r\nlay in the fact that prince and peasant, capitalist and labourer,\r\nliterate and illiterate, educated and uneducated, all joined hands.” For\r\nsome time the boycott was so effective that _The Englishman_, an\r\nAnglo-Indian newspaper published in Calcutta, declared: “It is\r\nabsolutely true that Calcutta warehouses are full of fabrics that can\r\nnot be sold. In the earlier days of the boycott it was the fashion to\r\nassert that depression in piece goods trade was due to this or the other\r\neconomic cause.\r\n\r\n“Many prominent Marwari[72] Firms have been absolutely ruined and a\r\nnumber of the biggest European import houses have had either to close\r\ndown their piece goods branch or to put up with a very small business,\r\nwhere they previously had a large one. As for stocks in warehouses, they\r\ntend to grow larger, as Marwari and Indian buyers who had given forward\r\norders, now state that they can not afford to take delivery. These facts\r\nare now so well known that it is idle to attempt to hide them. Indeed\r\nthe time has come when all injuries inflicted on trade by boycott should\r\nbe made fully known. There is no question of encouraging the boycotters,\r\nas they need no encouragement. But there is the question of thoroughly\r\nawakening the public at home and the Government of India to the fact\r\nthat in boycott the enemies of the Ráj have found a most effective\r\nweapon for injuring British interests in the country.”\r\n\r\nThe triumph of the boycotters was testified to by the following remarks\r\nof _The Englishman_, with which the article ended: “The question however\r\nis, what is the Government going to do about it? _Boycott must not be\r\nacquiesced in, or it will more surely ruin British connection with India\r\nthan an armed revolution._” [The italics are ours.]\r\n\r\n_Government’s Reply._ In reply to this move on the part of the Bengalee\r\nleaders,--a move in which all Bengal was united, including the present\r\nmoderates,--the Government started a crusade against the students whom\r\nthe boycotters had enlisted in their service. The bureaucracy thought\r\nthat the more active part of the propaganda was carried on by them.\r\nAccording to Mr. B. C. Pal, “the success of the boycott, especially in\r\nthe earlier stages before the sentiment had time to settle down into the\r\nconscience and consciousness of the people, depended almost entirely\r\nupon picketing.” Mr. Pal assures us that “their method was uniformly\r\nintellectual and moral,” and that “there was no intimidation, no\r\nviolence, no appeal to physical fear, none of the things that\r\ncharacterise picketing among the robuster people of the West.”\r\n\r\nThe British, of course, do not accept this statement as true. But\r\nwhatever its nature, the Government did not like picketing. They thought\r\nthey could not stand by and let a movement of that kind gain strength.\r\n“Their first move was to make it penal for the young student population\r\nto participate in any way in the nationalist activities. Students who\r\nattended public meetings were threatened with various punishments to the\r\nextent even of expulsion from school, college, or university.”\r\n\r\n_The Second Move of the Bengalees: The National University._ The\r\nBengalee leaders then put their heads together and resolved to start a\r\nNational University, wherein education would be given independent of\r\ngovernment control. The educational policy of Lord Curzon had already\r\nset people to thinking along that line. The measures now adopted to\r\nstrike at the boycott movement by punishing the students who\r\nparticipated therein “accentuated the need and called forth actual\r\nmeasures to meet it.” This movement also, like the boycott, met the\r\nuniversal support of United Bengal. The actual leadership of it fell on\r\nSir Gurdas Bannerjea, late Judge of the Calcutta High Court, who had\r\nbeen vice-chancellor of the Calcutta University for some time and whose\r\nloyalty and moderation had never been questioned by friend or foe.\r\nBesides, he had sat on the University Commission appointed by Lord\r\nCurzon and had written a note of dissent from the policy recommended by\r\nthe majority of its members. “Under his guidance, the Bengal Council of\r\nNational Education proposed to work, independent of, but by no means in\r\nopposition to, the Government Education Department. And this independent\r\nactivity was justified on the ground that the education hitherto\r\nimparted under official supervision lacked a vital reference to the\r\nthoughts, the sentiments, the traditions, the religions, and even the\r\nouter physical and biological environments of the people. The object of\r\nthe new movement was to organise a thoroughly national system of\r\neducation, both scientific and literary, as well as technical, on\r\n_national lines_ and under _national control_.”\r\n\r\nBesides making an ample provision for literary, scientific, and\r\ntechnical education, the National Council of Education at once reduced\r\nEnglish to the status of a secondary language, the first place being\r\ngiven to Bengalee and Sanskrit, and in the case of Mohammedans to Urdu,\r\nPersian, and Arabic.\r\n\r\nThe National Education Movement in Bengal was in no way an\r\nanti-government movement. Though it owed its “initiation to the threats\r\nof the Government to close the doors of the official schools and\r\ncolleges and universities against those who would take any part in, even\r\nto the extent of simply attending, any political meeting or\r\ndemonstration, the National Education Movement in Bengal sought to avoid\r\nall open causes of friction with the authorities and proposed to work\r\n_independent of_, but not in _opposition to_, the Government. Political\r\nin its origin, it tried to avoid all conflicts with the authorities by\r\nassuming an absolutely non-political attitude.”\r\n\r\n_Arabinda Ghosh._ To this movement, Indian Nationalism owes the emerging\r\ninto prominence of a quiet, unostentatious, young Hindu, who was till\r\nthen comparatively obscure, holding his soul in patience and waiting for\r\nopportunities to send currents of the greatest strength into the\r\nnation’s system. He was gathering energy. His name was Arabinda Ghosh.\r\nArabinda had received first class education in England. The headmaster\r\nof the school, where he studied before joining the university, is\r\nreported to have said that during the 25 to 30 years he had been in\r\ncharge of the school, Arabinda Ghosh was by far the most richly endowed\r\nin intellectual capacity of any of the students that had come under his\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nAt Cambridge he distinguished himself in European classics and took\r\nfirst class honours. He\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARABINDA GHOSH]\r\n\r\npassed the Indian Civil Service examinations with credit, but failed in\r\nthe test for horsemanship. Never did a failure prove more a blessing\r\nthan in his case.\r\n\r\nHe was in the service of His Highness, the Maharaja of Baroda,[73]\r\ndrawing a salary of about 500 pounds sterling, when his country’s call\r\ncame to him. He listened to it readily, gave up his post and agreed to\r\nbe the principal of the National College on ten pounds a month. We are\r\ntold by one who worked with him for some time that he did not support\r\nthe “declaration of the National Council of Education” about their\r\nnon-political attitude. He could not appreciate this needless dread, as\r\nthey thought, of offending official susceptibilities. He, however,\r\naccepted the verdict of the majority and began his work. But his\r\nposition as “the nominal head of the National College, controlled by\r\nmen” who “differed from him in their political views and opinions,\r\nbecame almost from the very beginning anomalous.” This was rather\r\nunfortunate. Arabinda Ghosh had received the best modern education that\r\nany man of his country and generation could expect to have. He had for\r\nsome years been a teacher of youth in Baroda and had acquired\r\nconsiderable experience in his art. He had clearly realised the spirit\r\nand actualities of the life of his nation, and knew how the most\r\nadvanced principles of pedagogy could be successfully worked into a\r\nthoroughly national system of education in India. He knew that the\r\nfoundations of national independence and national greatness must be\r\nlaid in a strong and advanced system of national education. He had a\r\npolitical ideal, no doubt; but politics meant to him much more than is\r\nordinarily understood by the term. It was not a game of expediency, but\r\na “school of human character” which acted and reacted on the life of the\r\nnation. “Education could no more be divorced from politics,” in his\r\nopinion, “than it could be divorced from religion and morals. Any system\r\nof education that helps such isolation and division between the various\r\norganic relations of life is mediæval and not modern.”[74]\r\n\r\nThe monied leaders of the National Council of Education movement,\r\nhowever, could not accept Arabinda’s principles. “They were not free\r\nfrom the fear of possible official opposition, which, if once aroused,\r\nwould make their work, they thought, absolutely impossible. They had a\r\nreal dread of the bureaucracy” whom they were not prepared to defy.\r\nExperience has shown that they were quite mistaken if they thought they\r\ncould develop their scheme of education without rousing the fears and\r\nthe bitterest opposition of the bureaucracy, even after declaring the\r\nnon-political character of their scheme.\r\n\r\nNever before in the history of the human race was it so well realised as\r\nnow that the school is the nursery of the man and the citizen. Lord\r\nCurzon realised it in full and it was his aim to curtail or, if\r\npossible, crush the nationalist influences in the schools and colleges\r\nmanaged and conducted by Indian agencies. It was his desire to introduce\r\nthe English element in all these institutions and to put them under\r\nEnglish control. He had invited European missionaries to the Secret\r\nEducational Conference at Simla, but not a single Indian, Hindu or\r\nMohammedan. He could not trust them (_i. e._, the Indians) with his\r\nideas. Hence the need of secrecy. The National Council of Education was\r\nsupposed to be working against the spirit of his policy. He was gone,\r\nbut the bureaucracy who were identified with his wishes, views and\r\nschemes, were there. It was impossible that they would let the\r\nBengalees, whoever they might be, build up a system of education and a\r\nnetwork of educational institutions, that not only would owe nothing to\r\nthe Government but were also to be quite free of official or English\r\ncontrol and of English influence.\r\n\r\nThen, the very circumstances under which the National College was born\r\nand the National Schools affiliated to it were opened, gave them a\r\npolitical character. The Government and the bureaucracy were opposed to\r\nthe students taking any part in the boycott movement; the Bengalee\r\nleaders wanted them to do so, and hence the National College and the\r\nNational Schools. It was an open challenge--a revolt. Arabinda Ghosh was\r\nidentified with this revolt, and with him were associated a whole group\r\nof powerful writers and speakers, all men of high individuality and\r\nlofty ideals and of pure character. They accepted the decision of the\r\nmajority about the non-political character of the college, but no one\r\ncould deprive them of the use of their pen and tongue. Any attempt to do\r\nthat might have been fatal to the scheme. They started journals and\r\npreached the gospel of political and economic and educational\r\nindependence in the clearest language. They were all men of education\r\nand knew their history well. They fully realised what the consequences\r\nwere likely to be, and they were prepared for it. They were prepared to\r\nsuffer for their propaganda, but they were not yet prepared for\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n_The Nationalist Press._ They started a number of papers in Bengalee and\r\nalso in English, in which they gave their ideas to the people. The\r\n_Sandhya_ and the _Bande Mátaran_, as two of the new papers were called,\r\nbecame their classrooms. In a few months the face and the spirit of\r\nBengal was changed. The press, the pulpit, the platform, the writers of\r\nprose and poetry, composers of music and playwrights, all were filled\r\nwith the spirit of nationalism. Bande Mataram (Hail Motherland) was the\r\ncry of the day. It was chanted in schools, in colleges, in streets, in\r\nhouses, in public squares, almost everywhere. Even the government\r\noffices and the compounds of the private residences of European\r\nofficials resounded with it.\r\n\r\n_Sabhas_ and _Samitis_ and _Akharas_[75] leaped into existence by\r\nhundreds, where the Bengalee young men began to take lessons in fencing\r\nand other games. This was their reply to those who taunted them as\r\ncowards; for the famous, or rather infamous, remarks of Macaulay about\r\nBengalees were often hurled at their heads by the Anglo-Indians, or new\r\nlanguage was used to express the same thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe boycott had created an unheard of situation in some of the districts\r\nin Eastern Bengal. In one district--Barisal--the Superintendent of\r\nPolice and the Collector had both failed to be able to buy a piece of\r\nManchester shirting for one of their friends, as no trader would sell it\r\nexcept by permission of the gentleman who was the leader of the\r\nboycotters. This leader happened to be a man who had made his influence\r\nby his character and by service. He was, so to say, the uncrowned king\r\nof his district. That was a crusher to the bureaucracy. No foreign\r\nbureaucracy could tolerate it. Sir William Bamfylde Fuller, on whom had\r\nfallen the first Lieutenant Governorship of Eastern Bengal, was\r\nbewildered by the strength of the movement and the new character which\r\nthe Bengalees were developing. The people refused to show him the\r\ncustomary honours. Even the presence of the Lieutenant Governor in the\r\ntown did not prevent the people from giving ovations to anti-partition\r\npropagandists and making anti-partition demonstrations. At one place it\r\nis said that even the railway porters refused to touch his baggage,\r\nwhich had to be carried by police constables. This was more than he\r\ncould bear.\r\n\r\n_Military Measures against Boycotters._ After consultation with Lord\r\nCurzon, he resolved to use force. The first step taken was the despatch\r\nof a hundred Gurkha troops to Barisal, followed by a demand for the\r\nwithdrawal of a circular issued by the local leaders advising the people\r\nof the legality of a peaceful boycott of British goods. It was evident\r\nthat a refusal meant a physical conflict, which the leaders were yet\r\nanxious to avoid. So the leaders decided to withdraw and the governor\r\nwas mollified. The Gurkhas are said to have committed numerous outrages\r\non the people, but the leaders kept the latter under control, as they\r\ndid not want the Government to get a handle to crush the movement by\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1906, the Provincial Conference, which was attended by the\r\nmost prominent leaders of the two Bengals, was broken up by order of the\r\nMagistrate “almost at the point of the bayonet.” A procession of some\r\n800 or 900 delegates from the different districts of the two provinces,\r\n“including almost every prominent leader in the country, was dispersed\r\nby the police, who made a free use of their quarterstaffs and broke more\r\nthan one head under the very eyes of the District Superintendent of\r\nPolice.” The people, however, did not retaliate. So far, they were\r\ndetermined not to use force even against force. With every display of\r\nforce on the side of the Government, the nationalist movement gained\r\nground in popularity and in strength, until the masses, the women and\r\nchildren, all were saturated with it.\r\n\r\nThis was the birth of a new life in Bengal, which found its reflection\r\nin every phase of public activity, religious, social, economic,\r\neducational, or political. What was done in Bengal found its echo in\r\nthe rest of the country. So far the Nationalist party was united. The\r\nelder people, who had been born and bred and had lived in a different\r\natmosphere, were not in full accord with the younger party and\r\nremonstrated with the latter, when they indulged in intemperate\r\nlanguage. Some people in other provinces did not quite approve of the\r\nwholesale boycott, inaugurated and declared by the Bengalees, but\r\notherwise the nation was united, and the best mind of the nation was\r\nrather gratified at the turn things had taken.\r\n\r\n_Lord Minto._ With the advent of Lord Minto (in 1905), however, things\r\nbegan to assume a different shape. The first serious difference in the\r\nNationalist party occurred over the presidentship of the Indian National\r\nCongress at Calcutta in 1906, but an actual split was avoided by a\r\nclever and diplomatic move of the leaders of the new moderate party, who\r\nobtained the consent of Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji[76] to accept the\r\npresidentship, if offered to him. The Congress session of 1906 was\r\nrather an uproarious session, but eventually the spirit of compromise\r\nand conciliation prevailed and the so-called extremists practically\r\ngained all their points so far as the principle of them was concerned.\r\n\r\nBut it was clear, even to a superficial observer, that a split was\r\ninevitable; Lord Minto had succeeded Lord Curzon as Viceroy, and a\r\nvisible change was coming in the policy of the Government. Lord Curzon\r\nwas for a policy of repression; Minto inaugurated a reign of\r\nconciliation with repression. The movement might have succumbed if the\r\nGovernment had been courageous enough to annul or modify the Partition\r\nof Bengal, as they subsequently did in 1912. But that was not to be. On\r\nthat point the Government would not yield, though otherwise they were in\r\nfavour of making concessions.\r\n\r\n_Indian Press Gagged._ The years 1905, 1906, and 1907 were years of\r\npassive resistance. The nationalists indulged in strong language,\r\ncarried on a vigorous anti-British propaganda by means of the press and\r\nthe platform, used their pen and tongue rather freely, but did not think\r\nof using force. Editor after editor, and publisher after publisher was\r\nsent to prison without any diminution of the campaign. The years 1906\r\nand 1907 saw a regular “tug of war” between the Government on the one\r\nside and the nationalists on the other. A large number of prosecutions\r\nwere launched against the members of the press in Bengal and Bombay,\r\nPunjab and the United Provinces, Madras and the Central Provinces, and\r\nmany persons were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. A complete\r\nboycott, economic, political and social, was openly preached, and\r\npicketing was again resorted to. Some of the judicial trials were only\r\nfarcical, the judges being influenced by political considerations, and\r\nconvictions and sentences being foregone conclusions. Yet such was the\r\npeople’s regard for law, that so long as the procedure of an open trial\r\nwas not attacked, they did not think of employing\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAJPAT RAI\r\n\r\n_From a painting by Mrs. Rieber, Berkeley, Cal._]\r\n\r\nforce for purposes of revenge. Even ill-treatment, either in lock-ups,\r\nduring trial, or in prisons, after conviction, failed to incite the\r\npeople to force. Political prisoners were applauded, glorified, and\r\notherwise supported and backed, but no thought of revenge entered\r\nanybody’s head.\r\n\r\n_Deportation of Lajpat Rai._ The sudden deportation of Lajpat Rai,\r\nhowever, in May, 1907, changed the whole current of thought and action.\r\nThe nationalists concluded that the movement for passive resistance\r\nrequired to be supported by secret propaganda as well as the use of\r\nforce against force. In the words of the Honourable Mr. G. K. Gokhale,\r\nin a speech delivered in the Council of the Governor General after the\r\ndeportation of Lajpat Rai, the latter was a religious, social, and\r\neducational reformer and was loved and respected by large classes of his\r\ncountrymen all over the country. He was one of the persons whom the\r\nextreme Nationalists claimed as their own, whom the moderate\r\nNationalists also respected, and whom the populace “liked for his\r\nphilanthropic and educational activities.” The sudden capture of this\r\nman, without trial, without charge, and without notice, drove the young\r\nNationalists to frenzy.[77] Even the sober and the thoughtful among the\r\nNationalists were in despair.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Indian press all over the country, however, was in jubilation.\r\nThe leading semi-official daily published at Lahore, the headquarters\r\nof Lajpat Rai, described him as the leader of a deep-laid revolutionary\r\nmovement, every detail of which passed through his fingers. He was said\r\nto have a following of “100,000 desperadoes.” _The Englishman_, at\r\nCalcutta, charged him with having tampered with the loyalty of the\r\nIndian army, and having incited the King of Afghanistan to invade India.\r\nAs a result of adding, as they did, insult to the injury of deportation,\r\nthe country was ablaze with indignation. The step was condemned by the\r\nunanimous voice of the people. All differences of opinion were forgotten\r\nand the whole country joined in protest. The extreme wing of the\r\nnationalists, however, decided to take the next step. They decided to\r\nuse force and began to think of bomb and revolver and of a guerilla\r\nwarfare against the established despotism. The older people, though they\r\nsympathised, would not agree to take any part in the movement using\r\nphysical force, nor would they give their sanction to such a course.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that some sort of secret organisation existed in Bengal\r\nin 1906, but force did not enter into their programme till after May,\r\n1907, i.e., until after the deportation of Lajpat Rai. The deportation\r\ndecided them. Yet the first shot was not fired until December, 1907, and\r\nthe first bomb was not thrown until April or May, 1908. The split[78] at\r\nSurat in December, 1907, irrevocably divided the Nationalists into two\r\nparties, and confirmed the younger party in their programme of force.\r\nThe extremists saw the hand of the Government in the split. Within a\r\nfew months almost all the leaders were seized and thrown into prison. At\r\nSurat, Lajpat Rai, having thrown in his lot with the moderates, was for\r\na time left alone, but Bal Ganga Dhar Tilak, the Mahratta leader, was\r\nprosecuted and sentenced to six years’ transportation. Arabinda Ghosh\r\nwas also seized and prosecuted for conspiracy to wage war against the\r\nKing, though he was afterwards acquitted for want of evidence. Bepin\r\nChandra Pal was also seized and sentenced to six months’ imprisonment;\r\nChidambaran Pillai, a Madras leader, to six years; a Mohammedan leader\r\nof the United Provinces, Abul Hasan Hasrat Mohani, to one year. In\r\nDecember, 1908, nine of the Bengal leaders were seized in their homes\r\nand imprisoned by an administrative order without trial and without\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n_Disaffection Driven Underground._ These persecutions and sentences\r\nexasperated the younger party and drove disaffection underground.\r\nUndaunted by the loss of leaders, they continued their propaganda and\r\nmade several attempts on the lives of high officials. The life of the\r\nLieutenant Governor of Bengal was attempted no less than three times,\r\nonce in open daylight, when he was presiding at a certain state\r\nfunction. The life of the viceroy, Lord Minto, was also attempted, at\r\nAhmedabad. The political secretary of Lord Morley, then Secretary of\r\nState, was shot in London; a collector was murdered at Nasik, and many\r\nother “outrages” were committed. Publications suppressed and condemned\r\nwere published and circulated secretly; arms were smuggled and stolen;\r\nand attempts were made to wreck railways and otherwise terrorise the\r\nGovernment. Throughout the year 1908 and 1909 the movement was kept up\r\nat high pressure. Then in 1910 there was a comparative lull, though the\r\nrevolutionary activities did come up to the surface occasionally.\r\n\r\nThe year 1911 was perhaps the dullest year from the revolutionary point\r\nof view. That was the year of the King’s visit to India. The King\r\nmodified the Partition of Bengal and ordered the transfer of the capital\r\nto Delhi. For a time there was a great rejoicing in the country, not so\r\nmuch because the Partition had been annulled, but because it was a\r\nvirtual triumph of the Nationalist agitation.\r\n\r\n_Lord Hardinge Bombed._ In December, 1912, again, the revolutionary\r\nparty gave conclusive evidence of their existence and strength. A bomb\r\nwas thrown at Lord Hardinge, the Viceroy, when he was passing in\r\nprocession midst thousands of troops and hundreds of thousands of\r\nspectators, making his first state entry into the new capital of British\r\nIndia, the Delhi of the Moguls. Lord Hardinge was wounded, members of\r\nhis entourage killed and the procession broken up. The culprit escaped,\r\nand in spite of offers of huge rewards[79] and unprecedented police\r\nactivity has remained undetected up to the present time. This is\r\nconsidered to be the supreme achievement of the revolutionaries.\r\nThroughout 1913 and 1914 the revolutionaries were active, and the scanty\r\nnews that has filtered but from India during the war gives ample reason\r\nto think that they are very active now.\r\n\r\nWithin the last seven or eight years, the Government has tried every\r\nform of repression, and has also planned a programme of partial\r\nreconciliation, but they have so far failed to crush the extreme wing of\r\nthe Nationalist party, the wing that believes in force and that has\r\ntaken to all the methods of guerilla warfare against a foreign\r\ngovernment based on force.\r\n\r\nThe country is in such circumstances now that every step which the\r\nGovernment takes to repress and crush the movement or to punish the\r\noffenders, strengthens the spirit of revolt, adds to the volume and\r\nintensity of the desire for revenge, adds to the number of those who are\r\nprepared to suffer or even die for the cause. From the classes, the\r\nmovement has spread to the masses; from the non-fighting masses it is\r\nnow gaining ground and winning adherents among the fighting classes. In\r\n1907 the charge of tampering with the army, laid at the door of Lajpat\r\nRai, was ridiculous. Perhaps there was a certain amount of disaffection\r\namong the Punjab regiments due to the Agrarian legislation undertaken by\r\nthe Punjab Government, which deeply and detrimentally affected the\r\nclasses from which the army was recruited. When the legislation objected\r\nto was vetoed, that cause of disaffection was removed; but since then\r\nfresh causes have affected at least certain sections of the army also,\r\nso that it cannot be said that the whole army is free from disaffection.\r\nThe riot at Singapore, caused by the revolt of one of the Indian\r\nregiments stationed there, and certain happenings in the Punjab, amply\r\nprove this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTYPES OF NATIONALISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now see how many types of Nationalists there are in India. From\r\nwhat follows in the chapter, the reader should not conclude that the\r\nIndian Nationalists are disunited. So far as the goal is concerned there\r\nis practical unanimity in all ranks. Even those who stand for complete\r\nindependence would be glad to have self-government within the Empire, if\r\nthat were promised in the near future. As to methods, there is the usual\r\ncleavage to be found in all struggles for freedom in all countries. One\r\nparty stands for the use of physical force, the other for peaceful\r\nmeans. The Indian Nationalists, too, are divided into two parties, the\r\nphysical force party and the moderate party. The following account of\r\nthe types is intended to show the different lines of their thinking.\r\nComplete unanimity in principles and methods can only be expected of a\r\ncollection of machine-made clogs of wood.\r\n\r\n_The Extremists._ (1) To take up the extremists first: There are some\r\nwho do not recognise the British Government at all. They think that the\r\nGovernment of the British in India is founded on force and fraud. They\r\nhave therefore no scruples to use force as well as fraud against the\r\nGovernment. In their eyes every one who is helping the Government in\r\nIndia either by accepting their service or otherwise by willing\r\nco-operation, abets the crime of which the Britishers are guilty. They\r\ndo not recognise British laws nor their courts. They have no respect or\r\nuse for either. They believe that their nationalism gives them the right\r\nof removing every one who stands in the way of their propaganda, whether\r\nby force or fraud. In their heart of hearts they are against every one\r\nwho supports the British Government in India, but in the prosecution of\r\ntheir object they do not desire to strike at all of them. But if need be\r\nthey are prepared to strike at any one. They have declared war against\r\nthe British Government. Their leaders have assumed the right of passing\r\nsentences against those who are of the enemy. They judge and deal\r\nseverely with those whom they think guilty of treason against them. They\r\nalso consider themselves entitled to collect taxes as they call them,\r\nand make impositions on people in India. Acting on the principle that\r\nthe safety of the state is the first consideration for all those who\r\nform the state, and that in case of necessity the state has a right to\r\nuse the property of every private individual who is included in the body\r\npolitic, they are prepared to exact their impositions by force. The fact\r\nthat the British Government is the enemy against whom they have declared\r\nwar, gives them the right to loot British treasuries and injure their\r\nproperty wherever and whenever they can.\r\n\r\nThe other principle stated above justifies in their eyes the taking by\r\nforce of the property or wealth of those who would not give it willingly\r\nor voluntarily for the safety of the state as conceived by them. Hence\r\nthe “dacoities.”\r\n\r\n_A few Nihilists._ The men engaged in those dacoities are of two kinds:\r\nThere are those who have no moral or religious scruples. They are\r\n“_nihilists_.” But their number is exceedingly small. They are not\r\nimmoral people. For their own self or for private persons, they would\r\nnot do anything which in any way contravenes the prevailing code of\r\nmorality; they would neither steal nor rob, nor kill nor injure any\r\nperson. But for the purpose of their movement they would do anything.\r\nTheir number however is, as we said above, exceedingly small. Then there\r\nare those who are extremely religious and spiritual. Some of them are\r\nthe followers of the “_Kali_”[80] cult as it is understood in Bengal;\r\nothers are Vedantists. There are some who are deists or theists.\r\n\r\n_Religious Extremists._ In every case, however, they believe that the\r\nBritish are the enemies of their Motherland and also of their religion.\r\nThey would not touch one hair of any one simply because that person\r\nbelonged to a religion different from theirs; but they would not scruple\r\nto kill any one who interferes with their religion. They believe that\r\nthey owe their lives to the Motherland, whom they worship as the means\r\nof enabling them to be worthy of the worship of the Supreme Mother of\r\nthe Universe. We will once more quote Mr. Pal[81] to explain what we\r\nmean, or rather how he puts the idea:\r\n\r\n_The Mother Worshippers._ “The so-called idolatry of Hinduism,” he says,\r\n“is also passing through a mighty transfiguration. The process started\r\nreally with Bankim Chandra,[82] who interpreted the most popular of the\r\nHindu goddesses as symbolic of the different stages of national\r\nevolution. _Jagatdhatri_--riding a lion which has the prostrate body of\r\nan elephant under its paw, represented the motherland in the early\r\njungle-clearing stage. This is, says Bankim Chandra, the mother as she\r\nwas. _Kali_, the grim goddess, dark and naked, bearing a garland of\r\nhuman heads around her neck,--heads from which blood is dripping,--and\r\ndancing on the prostrate form of Shiva, the God--this, says Bankim\r\nChandra, is the mother as she is, dark, because ignorant of herself; the\r\nheads with dripping blood are those of her own children, destroyed by\r\nfamine and pestilence; the jackals[83] licking these drippings are the\r\nsymbol of desolation and decadence of social life, and the prostrate\r\nform of Shiva means that she is trampling her own God under her feet.\r\n_Durga_, the ten-headed goddess, armed with swords and spears in some\r\nhands, holding wheat-sheaves in some, offering courage and peace with\r\nothers, riding a lion, fighting with demons; with Sarasvati, or the\r\ngoddess of Knowledge and Arts, supported by Ganapati, the god of\r\nWisdom, on her one side, and Lakshmi, the goddess of Wealth, protected\r\nby Kartikeya, the leader of the Heavenly army, on the other side--this,\r\nsays Bankim Chandra, is the mother as she will be. This interpretation\r\nof the old images of gods and goddesses has imparted a new meaning to\r\nthe current ceremonialism of the country, and multitudes, while\r\nworshipping either _Jagatdhatri_, or _Kali_, or _Durga_, accost them\r\nwith devotion and enthusiasm, with the inspiring cry of Bande Mataram.\r\nAll these are the popular objects of worship of the Indian Hindus,\r\nespecially in Bengal. And the transfiguration of these symbols is at\r\nonce the cause and the evidence of the depth and the strength of the\r\npresent movement. This wonderful transfiguration of the old gods and\r\ngoddesses is carrying the message of new nationalism to the women and\r\nthe masses of the country.”\r\n\r\n_Vedantists._ “Behind this mighty transfiguration of the old religious\r\nideas and symbols of the country stands, however, a new philosophy of\r\nlife. Strictly speaking, it is not a new philosophy either, but rather a\r\nsomewhat new application of the dominant philosophical speculations of\r\nthe race. Behind the new nationalism in India stands the old Vedantism\r\nof the Hindus. This ancient Indian philosophy, divided into many\r\nschools, has one general idea running through it from end to end. It is\r\nthe idea of the essential unity of man and God. According to this\r\nphilosophy, Substance is one though expressed through many forms.\r\nReality is one though appearances are multitudinous. Matter, in the eye\r\nof this philosophy, is not material, but essentially spiritual, the\r\nthought of God concretised. Man is the spirit of God incarnated. The\r\nmeaning of cosmic evolution is to be found, not in itself, but in the\r\nthought of the Absolute. It is, to adopt the Hegelian dictum, the\r\nmovement of the Self away from itself, to return to itself, to be\r\nitself. The Absolute, or Brahman, is the beginning, the middle, and the\r\nend of this evolutionary process. He is the Regulative idea. He is\r\ncosmic evolution. He is progressively revealing himself through the\r\nworld process. In man, the Divine idea, or the Logos, comes slowly to\r\nconsciousness of itself. The end of human evolution is the fullest\r\nrealisation of man’s unity with God. Long, especially in what may be\r\ncalled the middle ages in India, this essential unity between God and\r\nman was sought to be realised through metaphysical abstractions, by\r\nnegation of the social and civic life. There was an undue emphasis on\r\nthe Subjective and the Universal to the neglect of the realities\r\n(however relative they might be) of the Objective and the Particular.\r\nProtests had, however, been made from time to time against these monkish\r\nabstractions, but in spite of these abstractions the dominant note\r\ncontinued to be that of Abstract Monism. Neo-Vedantism, which forms the\r\nvery soul and essence of what may be called Neo-Hinduism, has been\r\nseeking to realise the old spiritual ideals of the race, not through\r\nmonkish negations or mediæval abstractions, but by the idealisation and\r\nthe spiritualisation of the concrete contents and actual relations of\r\nlife. It demands, consequently, a social, an economic, and a political\r\nreconstruction, such as will be helpful to the highest spiritual life of\r\nevery individual member of the community. The spiritual note of the\r\npresent Nationalist Movement in India is entirely derived from this\r\nVedantic thought.\r\n\r\n“Under the influence of this Neo-Vedantism, associated to a large extent\r\nwith the name of the late Swami Vivekananda, there has been at work a\r\nslow and silent process of the liberalisation of the old social ideas.\r\nThe old bigotry that anathematised the least deviation from the rules of\r\ncaste, or the authority of custom, is openly giving way to a spirit of\r\nnew tolerance. The imperious necessities of national struggle and\r\nnational life are slowly breaking down, except in purely ceremonial\r\naffairs, the old restrictions of caste. In the new movement, old and\r\northodox Brahmins are rendering open obeisance to the heterodox and\r\nnon-Brahmin teachers. There is an evident anxiety to discover spiritual\r\nand traditional authority for even the outrages that some of these have\r\ncommitted against the old social and sacerdotal order. And where no such\r\nauthority could be found, their personal freedom of thought and action\r\nis being condoned on the principle that those who are to be the saviours\r\nof their nation stand, like the mendicant and the holy man, above all\r\nlaw. And all this is a proof of the strange hold that the new\r\nnationalist propaganda has got on the real mind and soul of the people.”\r\n\r\nTo these two classes, the Mother worshippers, and the Vedantists, belong\r\nthe great bulk of the Bengal Nationalists. They are neither “nihilists”\r\nnor “anarchists.” They are patriots who have raised their patriotism to\r\nthe pitch of a religion. Their religion remarkably fits in with their\r\npatriotism and makes the latter indescribably intense and alive. Their\r\nwhole life is permeated with it. They realise their “duty” every moment\r\nof their life and they are prepared to do anything and take any and\r\nevery risk in the performance of that duty. They live on little; their\r\nfood is abstemious; they scrupulously avoid liquor; they clothe\r\nthemselves scantily; luxury they do not know. They can fast for days and\r\ngo without sleep for days. Generally they are men of their word, men of\r\nhonour, imbued with a strong idea of self-respect, true to their vows;\r\nmen who are not swayed by lust or passion.\r\n\r\nTo this class belonged most of the Maniktolah party, Barendra and his\r\nfriends. But it is evident that there are some theists among them,\r\n_i.e._, theists in the Western sense of the term. The man who shot\r\nGossain, the first _approver_[84] in Bengal, was a\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAR DAYAL]\r\n\r\nBrahmo (member of the Brahmo Samaj). They have some Mohammedans and some\r\nChristians, too, among them. _Brahm Bhandu Bandhopadhyai_[85] was a\r\nChristian at one time. These people have followers and adherents\r\nthroughout India, in the Punjab, in the United Provinces, in Maharastra,\r\nin Gujrat, in Behar, in Rajputana, even in Madras.\r\n\r\n_Advocates of Organised Rebellion._ (2) Next in order come those who\r\ndiffer from the first in so far as they do not believe in individual\r\nmurders or dacoities. For traitors and approvers even they have no\r\nmercy, but they would not murder individual British officers or Indians\r\nin the service of the Government; nor would they rob private persons.\r\nThey are for organised rebellion, for tampering with the army, for\r\nraising the standard of revolt, and for carrying on a guerilla war. For\r\nthe purposes of this rebellion or war they may do and will do anything\r\nthat is necessary to be done; but otherwise they would neither murder\r\nnor loot.\r\n\r\n_Har Dayal._ To this class, I think, belongs Har Dayal. It is very\r\ninteresting to note the development of this man. He comes from a\r\nKayastha family of Delhi and received his education in a mission school\r\nand a mission college under Christian influence. He was a member of the\r\nYoung Men’s Christian Association when he graduated. Then he came to\r\nLahore and joined the government college there, as a stipend holder,\r\nwhere he took his Master of Arts degree in 1903, standing at the top of\r\nthe list. His subject was “English language and literature” and so\r\nthorough was his mastery of the language that in some papers he obtained\r\nfull marks. He continued there for another year and took his M.A. degree\r\na second time in History. All this time he was a cosmopolitan, more of a\r\nBrahmo than a Hindu or a Nationalist. Then he left for England, having\r\nsecured a Government of India scholarship, and joined the St. John’s\r\nCollege at Oxford. It is needless to say that even here he maintained\r\nhis reputation for brilliant scholarship, but what is remarkable is,\r\nthat it was here that he became a Nationalist. He is a man of strong\r\nimpulses. For him, to believe is to act. It appears that within a short\r\ntime he developed ideas of a rather extreme type. He came to believe\r\nthat the English were undermining Hindu character; that their\r\neducational policy and methods had been designed to destroy Hinduism and\r\nto perpetuate the political bondage of the Hindus, by destroying their\r\nsocial consciousness and their national individuality. He studied the\r\nhistory of the British rule and British institutions in India from\r\noriginal documents, parliamentary blue books and varied other sources,\r\nand came to the conclusion that the British were deliberately\r\nAnglicising the Indians with a view to destroying their nationalism and\r\nto impressing them with the inferiority of their institutions, so that\r\nthey might value the British connection and become Britishers. He\r\nthought it wrong to study in their institutions, take their degrees, and\r\notherwise benefit from anything which they did as rulers of India. As we\r\nhave said above, for him to believe was to act. As soon as he formed\r\nthe above opinions, he made up his mind to resign his stipend, give up\r\nhis studies, and return to India, which he did towards the end of 1907.\r\nEven before he reached India, he gave up English dress and began to\r\neschew all the peculiarities of English life. He took to Indian shoes,\r\nIndian cap, Indian Kurta (shirt), Indian Pajama (trousers) and wrapped\r\nhimself in an Indian shawl. He would not even mix with Mohammedans and\r\nChristians. For a time he was a strict Hindu in form, though not in\r\nreligion. When his old master, Principal Rudra of the Delhi St.\r\nStephen’s College, called on him at Lahore, he would not shake hands\r\nwith him nor offer him a seat on his mat, because he was a Christian (he\r\nhad no chairs). His cult at that time was a wholesale and complete\r\nboycott of British government and British institutions. He aimed to\r\nestablish an order of Hindu ascetics to preach his ideas and to spread\r\nhis propaganda. With that view he collected about half a dozen young men\r\nabout him, who, under his inspiration, left their studies as well as\r\ntheir homes and showed their readiness to do as he would wish them to\r\ndo. He lived a life of purity and wanted others to do the same. At that\r\ntime he did not believe in or preach violence. He discussed, argued,\r\npreached, and wrote for the press. His writings began to attract\r\nattention, and so did his activities, and it was feared that the\r\nGovernment would soon find some means of putting him out of the way. So\r\nhe decided to leave the country, and in the beginning of the second half\r\nof the year 1908 left India for good. He went to England, with the idea\r\nof preaching his gospel among the Indian students in England. He stayed\r\nthere for some time and found out that there was not much scope for his\r\ntype of nationalism. He also feared that the British Government might\r\narrest him. So he left England and for about two years travelled, to and\r\nfro, to find a place where he could live very cheaply and without fear\r\nof molestation from the British Government and carry on his propaganda.\r\nHe was for over a year in France, where he came in contact with the best\r\npolitical thought of Europe. Here he made friends with Egyptian\r\nnationalists and Russian revolutionists. His knowledge of the French\r\nlanguage was good. He could not only speak that language fluently, but\r\ncould compose in it. He used to write occasionally for the French press.\r\nHe can use the German language also. Eventually he came to America and\r\nsettled here. The contributions that he made to the Indian press during\r\nthe first year of his sojourn in the United States did not indicate any\r\nvery great change in his views on Nationalism, but a year after he was\r\nquite a different man. His political nationalism remained the same, but\r\nhis views on social questions, on morality, on Hindu literature and\r\nHindu institutions, underwent a complete metamorphosis. He began to look\r\ndown upon everything Hindu and developed a great admiration for\r\nOccidental ideas of freedom. There is, however, one thing about him that\r\nhas stuck fast, and that is his hatred of British rule in India. His\r\npresent cult is to dissuade Indians from engaging in any work except\r\nthat of political propaganda. We are told by him (that was what he said\r\nto American journalists at the time of his arrest in San Francisco as an\r\nundesirable alien) that he is not an anarchist and that he does not\r\nadvocate the use of bomb and of revolver for private murders or for the\r\nmurders of individuals. We have no reason to disbelieve him. Nobody,\r\nhowever, knows what changes are yet to take place in his views. He is a\r\nquite uncertain item. He is an idealist of a strange type. He is simple\r\nin his life and apparently quite indifferent to the opinions of others\r\nabout him. He does not court favour at the hands of any one and would go\r\nout of his way to help others. He is loved and respected by hundreds and\r\nthousands of his countrymen, including those who do not agree with his\r\nviews or his propaganda or his programme. Even the late Mr. Gokhale\r\nadmired him.\r\n\r\n_Hardayalism._ Har Dayal is an advocate of open rebellion; he does not\r\nadvocate the use of the bomb or the revolver for killing individuals,\r\nbut he admires and glorifies those who have risked their lives using the\r\nsame.[86]\r\n\r\nNeither of these classes is prepared to make any compromise with the\r\nBritish. They stand for absolute independence; full _Swaraj_. They know,\r\nperhaps, that they have a very difficult task before them, but they have\r\nconfidence in themselves and believe that the difficulties are not\r\ninsuperable. They do not believe that in order to gain Swaraj, India\r\nshould have more widespread education, or that social reform and social\r\nconsolidation must precede political freedom. They consider that these\r\nare all fads, ideas with which the British have inoculated the Indians\r\nin order to keep them busy with non-political activities and to keep\r\ndown their manhood. It is a part of the imperial game that the rulers\r\nshould manage to fill the ruled with the idea of their own incompetence\r\nto manage their affairs, of their inability to unite, of many\r\ndifferences and divisions among them, and of their incapacity to win\r\ntheir freedom. These nationalists deprecate communal or sectional\r\nactivities. They do not countenance the organisations engaged in\r\nreligious and social reform. In their opinion all these so-called reform\r\norganisations are doing positive mischief in keeping the nation engaged\r\nin less important matters and in directing the nation’s mind from the\r\nall important question of national freedom. They want to concentrate the\r\nnation’s mind on this one point.\r\n\r\n_Political Freedom the First Condition of Life._ According to them life\r\nin political bondage or in political subjection is a negation of life.\r\nLife signifies power and capacity to grow and progress. A slave, a\r\nbondsman, is not free to grow. His interests are always subordinate to\r\nthose of his master. He must give the best in him to the service of the\r\nlatter. His will must always be under his master’s will, who is\r\npractically his conscience’s keeper. No man can grow to the full stature\r\nof his manhood; no man can rise to the best in him; no man can make the\r\nbest use of his faculties and opportunities; no man can develop either\r\nhis body or his soul according to his liking, under these circumstances.\r\nWhatever he does, he does for his master, in his name and in his\r\ninterest. The credit and the glory and the benefit of it, all accrue to\r\nhim.[87] If this is true of an individual slave, it is equally true of a\r\nnation in political bondage.\r\n\r\nAs a proof of the truth of their statements, they point to the history\r\nand activities of the Indian National Congress. The Congress people ask\r\nfor Universal Primary Education; the Government says no. They can not\r\nfind money for it; “the country is not prepared for it; nor is it good\r\nfor the people at large.” If the masses are educated, they might become\r\ndiscontented and create trouble for the Government. The Congress wants a\r\nrepeal of the Arms Act; the Government says no. The people might use the\r\narms against the Government, and that is a calamity to be avoided. The\r\nCongress desires that Indians be enrolled as volunteers; the Government\r\nsays no. It is not desirable to give military training to the Indians.\r\nThey might use it against the Government. It is not desirable to have\r\ncompanies of volunteers composed of Indians only, as they might conspire\r\nagainst the reigning power. It is equally undesirable to force them on\r\nEuropean and Eurasian companies against their wishes, as that would\r\nwound their social and imperial susceptibilities. The Congress\r\npolitician wants to protect Indian industries; the Government says no.\r\nThat will injure Lancashire. The Congress wants more of technical\r\neducation; the Government says, the country does not need it and they\r\ncan not spare funds for it. The Congress wants national schools and\r\nnational universities; the Government says no, “you may misuse them.”\r\nThe keynote of the situation is, that India must exist in the interests\r\nof England and Englishmen; or at any rate England and English\r\npoliticians know what is good and useful for India, how much she should\r\nand how much she should not have; in what line she should advance and in\r\nwhat she should not. India and Indians have no right to think for\r\nthemselves. Anything they think or decide to do must be tested by\r\nEnglishmen according to their standards and in the way they think it is\r\nlikely to further the interests of their empire.\r\n\r\nThese nationalists therefore maintain that the first condition of\r\nlife,--life with respect and honour, life for profit and advantage, life\r\nfor progress and advancement,--is political freedom. Life without that\r\nis no life. It is idle therefore to think of matters which are\r\nmanifestations or developments or embellishments of life.\r\n\r\nEducation can only profit a living being. A human being instructed on\r\nthe lines on which certain beasts or animals are instructed, can, like\r\nthe latter, only respond to the calls of his master. The master wants\r\nthem to salute; they salute. The master wants them to dance; they dance.\r\nThe master wants them to do any other job for him; they do it. Their\r\nwill and intellect are always subordinate to the master. Independent of\r\nthe master, they have neither will nor intellect. Education under these\r\ncircumstances, they maintain, is a degrading of human faculties, and a\r\ntravesty. In their opinion it would be best for their people to remain\r\nuneducated, rather than be educated only for the benefit and use of\r\ntheir masters.\r\n\r\nSimilarly they think that all the schemes for social reform, for\r\nsectarian advancement, for commercial interests, are nothing more than\r\nso many devices for dividing the nation and keeping them engaged in\r\nnever-ending internecine quarrels. They consider this to be a misplaced\r\ndissipation of energies and a misuse of opportunities. They wish that\r\nevery man and woman in India should for the present think of nothing\r\nelse but political freedom. The first thing is to get rid of the\r\nforeigner. Who will rule India and how, what shape will the government\r\nof the country take, how will the different religions and different\r\ninterests be represented therein?--these and other cognate questions do\r\nnot trouble them. They believe that as soon as England leaves India,\r\nsome one will rise sphinxlike who will establish some form of national\r\ngovernment. The time will produce the man. It would be then time to\r\nthink and discuss how to improve it. They do not mind if the Hindus or\r\nthe Mohammedans or the Sikhs or the Gurkhas rule India; nor whether it\r\nis the Maharaja of Nepal or that of Odeypore, or that of Baroda, or that\r\nof Patiala, or the Nawab of Hyderabad, or that of Bhawalpore, who\r\nbecomes supreme; nor whether the form of government is monarchical or\r\noligarchic, or republican. These questions do not trouble them. They do\r\nnot, of course, want any foreign government, but if the way of eventual\r\nnational freedom lies that way, they do not mind even that. Anything\r\nwould be better than the present government. The British Government is\r\nslowly dissolving the nation. If they have to die, they would rather die\r\nof plague or cholera, than of typhoid or consumption. The apprehensions\r\nof disturbances of peace do not frighten them. They are sick of peace.\r\nPeace under existing conditions has unmanned the nation; it has\r\nemasculated the people and sapped their manhood. Anything rather than\r\npeace at such price. The desire for peace on any terms, has been the\r\ncurse of British rule. It has done them more harm than disorder or\r\nanarchy ever did. Blessed was the disorder that preceded the rise of the\r\nMahratta power or the establishment of the Sikh commonwealth. Blessed\r\nwere the conditions of life that produced a Partap, a Sivaji, a Durga\r\nDass, and a Govind Singh.[88] Cursed are the conditions of peace that\r\ncan only produce Daffadars and Jamadars or at the most Risaldars[89] or\r\nKaiser-Hind-medallists.\r\n\r\nThis is Hardayalism. Most of the Nationalists of the two classes\r\ndescribed above belong to this school, but there are some among them who\r\ndo not wholly fall in with this view. They are prepared to agree that\r\nthe political question must always be in the forefront, and that nothing\r\nshould be done which may in any way overshadow this or relegate it to a\r\nsecondary position; but they do not believe that politics alone should\r\nusurp the whole thought and life of the nation. It would not be right to\r\nconclude from the above description that the Indian Nationalists have no\r\n_constructive_ programme for the future, but it is obvious that in the\r\nabsence of freedom and opportunities to discuss it openly, opinions on\r\nthe subject can not be crystallised.\r\n\r\n_Arabinda Ghosh--Vedantist and Swarajist._ It is difficult to say to\r\nwhich of these classes, if to either at all, Arabinda Ghosh belonged or\r\nstill belongs. At one time it was believed that he belonged to the first\r\nclass, to which most of the other Bengalee extremists belonged, but\r\nwhether that belief was right and whether he still thinks on the same\r\nlines, it is difficult to say. One thing is certain, that he was and is\r\nquite unlike Har Dayal in his line of thought. In intellectual acumen\r\nand in scholastic accomplishments he is perhaps superior to Har Dayal,\r\nbut above all he is deeply religious and spiritual. He is a worshipper\r\nof Krishna and is a high-souled Vedantist. Even simpler and more ascetic\r\nin his life and habits than Har Dayal, he is for an all-around\r\ndevelopment of Indian Nationalism. His notions of life and morality are\r\npre-eminently Hindu and he believes in the spiritual mission of his\r\npeople. His views may better be gathered from an interview, which he\r\nrecently gave to a correspondent of _The Hindu_, of Madras. We quote the\r\ninterview almost bodily and in the words of the interviewer.\r\n\r\n“But what do you think of the 1914 Congress and Conferences?” I\r\ninsisted.\r\n\r\nHe spoke almost with reluctance but in clear and firm accents. He said:\r\n“I do not find the proceedings of the Christmas Conferences very\r\ninteresting and inspiring. They seem to me to be mere repetitions of the\r\npetty and lifeless formulas of the past and hardly to show any sense of\r\nthe great breath of the future that is blowing upon us. I make an\r\nexception of the speech of the Congress President which struck me as far\r\nabove the ordinary level. Some people, apparently, found it visionary\r\nand unpractical. It seems to me to be the one practical and vital thing\r\nthat has been said in India for some time past.”\r\n\r\nHe continued: “The old, petty forms and little narrow, make-believe\r\nactivities are getting out of date. The world is changing rapidly around\r\nus and preparing for more colossal changes in the future. We must rise\r\nto the greatness of thought and action which it will demand from the\r\nnations who hope to live. No, it is not in any of the old formal\r\nactivities, but deeper down that I find signs of progress and hope. The\r\nlast few years have been a period of silence and compression, in which\r\nthe awakened _Virya_[90] and _Tejas_ of the nation have been\r\nconcentrating for a greater outburst of a better directed energy in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n“We are a nation of three hundred millions,” added Mr. Ghosh,\r\n“inhabiting a great country in which many civilisations have met, full\r\nof rich material and unused capacities. We must cease to think and act\r\nlike the inhabitants of an obscure and petty village.”\r\n\r\n“If you don’t like our political methods, what would you advise us to do\r\nfor the realisation of our destiny?”\r\n\r\nHe quickly replied: “Only by a general intellectual and spiritual\r\nawakening can this nation fulfil its destiny. Our limited information,\r\nour secondhand intellectual activities, our bounded interests, our\r\nnarrow life of little family aims and small money getting have prevented\r\nus from entering into the broad life of the world. Fortunately, there\r\nare ever-increasing signs of a widened outlook, a richer intellectual\r\noutput and numerous sparks of liberal genius which show that the\r\nnecessary change is coming. No nation in modern times can grow great by\r\npolitics alone. A rich and varied life, energetic in all its parts, is\r\nthe condition of a sound, vigorous national existence. From this point\r\nof view also the last five years have been a great benefit to the\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\nI then asked what he thought of the vastly improved relations that now\r\nexist between the Briton and the Indian in our own country and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n“It is a very good thing,” he said, and he explained himself in the\r\nfollowing manner: “The realisation of our nationhood separate from the\r\nrest of humanity was the governing idea of our activities from 1905 to\r\n1910. That movement has served its purpose. It has laid a good\r\nfoundation for the future. Whatever excesses and errors of speech and\r\naction were then disclosed, came because our energy, though admirably\r\ninspired, lacked practical experience and knowledge.\r\n\r\n“The idea of Indian nationhood is now not only rooted in the public\r\nmind, as all recent utterances go to show, but accepted in Europe and\r\nacknowledged by the Government and the governing race. The new idea that\r\nshould now lead us is the realisation of our nationhood not separate\r\nfrom, but in, the future scheme of humanity. When it has realised its\r\nown national life and unity, India will still have a part to play in\r\nhelping to bring about the unity of the nations.”\r\n\r\nI naturally put in a remark about the Under-Secretary’s “Angle of\r\nVision.”\r\n\r\n“It is well indeed,” observed Mr. Ghosh, “that British statesmen should\r\nbe thinking of India’s proper place in the Councils of the Empire, and\r\nit is obviously a thought which, if put into effect, must automatically\r\nalter the attitude of even the greatest extremists towards the\r\nGovernment and change for the better all existing political relations.\r\n\r\n“But it is equally necessary that we, Indians, should begin to think\r\nseriously what part Indian thought, Indian intellect, Indian nationhood,\r\nIndian spirituality, Indian culture have to fulfil in the general life\r\nof humanity. The humanity is bound to grow increasingly on. We must\r\nnecessarily be in it and of it. Not a spirit of aloofness or of jealous\r\nself-defence, but of generous emulation and brotherhood with all men and\r\nall nations, justified by a sense of conscious strength, a great\r\ndestiny, a large place in the human future--this should be the Indian\r\nspirit.”\r\n\r\nThe oneness of humanity is a topic dear to the heart of Babu Arabinda\r\nGhosh and when I (_i.e._, the interviewer) suggested to him that\r\nVedantic ideas would be a good basis for unity, his reply was full of\r\nenthusiasm:\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” he said, “I am convinced and have long been convinced that a\r\nspiritual awakening, a reawakening to the true self of a nation is the\r\nmost important condition of our national greatness. The supreme Indian\r\nidea of the oneness of all men in God and its realisation inwardly and\r\noutwardly, increasingly even in social relations and the structure of\r\nsociety is destined, I believe, to govern the progress of the human\r\nrace. India, if it chooses, can guide the world.”\r\n\r\nAnd here I said something about our “four thousand” castes, our\r\ndifferences in dress and in “caste marks,” our vulgar sectarian\r\nantipathies and so on.\r\n\r\n“Not so hard, if you please,” said Mr. Ghosh with a smile. “I quite\r\nagree with you that our social fabric will have to be considerably\r\naltered before long. We shall have, of course, to enlarge our family and\r\nsocial life, not in the petty spirit of present day Social Reform,\r\nhammering at small details and belittling our immediate past, but with a\r\nlarger idea and more generous impulses. Our past with all its faults and\r\ndefects should be sacred to us. But the claims of our future with its\r\nimmediate possibilities should be still more sacred.”\r\n\r\nHis concluding words were spoken in a very solemn mood:\r\n\r\n“It is more important,” he said, “that the thought of India should come\r\nout of the philosophical school and renew its contact with life, and the\r\nspiritual life of India issue out of the cave and the temple and,\r\nadapting itself to new forms, lay its hand upon the world. I believe\r\nalso that humanity is about to enlarge its scope by new knowledge, new\r\npowers and capacities, which will create as great a revolution in human\r\nlife as the physical science of the nineteenth century. Here, too, India\r\nholds in her past, a little rusted and put out of use, the key of\r\nhumanity’s future.\r\n\r\n“It is in these directions that I have been for some time impelled to\r\nturn my energies rather than to the petty political activities which are\r\nalone open to us at the present moment. This is the reason of my\r\ncontinued retirement and detachment from action. I believe in the\r\nnecessity at such times and for such great objects, of _Tapasya_,[91] in\r\nsilence for self-training, for self-knowledge and storage of spiritual\r\nforce. Our forefathers used that means, though in different forms. And\r\nit is the best means for becoming an efficient worker in the great days\r\nof the world.”\r\n\r\n_Ganesh Vináyak Savarkar._ At this stage we might mention the name of\r\nanother Nationalist, who exercised a vast influence on young Indians in\r\nEngland for a number of years and is now serving a life-term in the\r\nAndamans. We mean Ganesh Vináyak Savarkar. In the simplicity of his life\r\nhe was of the same class as Arabinda Ghosh and Har Dayal. In the purity\r\nof his life he was as high as either. In politics he fell in the first\r\ncategory minus their religious fervour. In his general views he was more\r\nor less what Har Dayal is, minus his denunciation of those who are\r\nengaged in non-political activities. Savarkar had extremely fine\r\nqualities of a leader. He has been caught because he was reckless; he\r\nnever cared about his personal safety; he had the dash of the old\r\nwarrior who always put himself in the post of danger. Har Dayal keeps\r\nhimself in the background and avoids danger. Arabinda stands midway\r\nbetween the two.\r\n\r\n_The Terrorists._ (3) The third class of Nationalists consists of those\r\nwho would like absolute independence, but who do not believe that it is\r\npossible in the near future. They approve of the occasional use of bomb\r\nand revolver for terrorist purposes; especially now when no other method\r\nhas been left of carrying on a propaganda of freedom. The press has been\r\ngagged; the platform has been dismantled. Any vigorous political\r\npropaganda, including strong criticism of the Government and its\r\nmethods, is out of the question. No one can point out the political and\r\neconomic disasters of foreign rule, much less discuss it with reference\r\nto actual facts and figures. There is no other way of reminding the\r\npeople at home and abroad of the standing and colossal wrong which the\r\nBritish Government is guilty of in keeping India under her yoke. In\r\ntheir opinion, the occasional use of the bomb and the revolver is the\r\nonly way to assert their manhood and their desire for freedom, and to\r\nannounce their dissatisfaction and discontent. It attracts attention all\r\nover the world. It makes people think of India. At home it reminds\r\npeople of the wrongs they have suffered and are suffering at the hands\r\nof the Government. At first it shocks the people, but then it stirs them\r\nto think. The bomb has entered Indian life, perhaps never to leave it.\r\nThey abhor it, but they are getting accustomed to it. They do not now\r\nthink so badly of those who use the bomb as they once used to.\r\n\r\n_Advocates of Constructive Nationalisation._ (4) In the fourth class are\r\ncomprised those who want independence, but not _at once_. They would\r\nrather consolidate the nation, raise its intellectual and moral tone,\r\nincrease its economic efficiency, before they raise the standard of\r\nrevolt. They do not believe that England will ever free them or give\r\nthem even Colonial Self-Government except under very great pressure.\r\nThey do not believe that nations let things go out of their grip or hold\r\nif they can help it, and unless their own safety demands it. In their\r\nopinion the Congress as well as the bomb have come rather early. They\r\nwould have the nation apply herself wholeheartedly to the work of\r\neducation and consolidation.\r\n\r\n_Independence, but not at once._ They do not want the British to go\r\nuntil the people of India are sufficiently strong to turn them out by\r\nforce, and are able to protect themselves and to maintain their\r\nindependence and their liberties against the outside world. They\r\nrecognise the force of the argument that the British may never allow\r\nthem to grow so strong as to be able to win their liberty, and by\r\nwaiting they might lose all conscious desire for political freedom and\r\nmight become permanent parasites. They, however, think that they can\r\nguard against such possibilities by keeping their nationalism alive and\r\nby occasionally suffering for it. Driven to this corner, they admit that\r\nnow that the Congress and the bomb have come, they might stay. In the\r\nopinion of some both are useful in their own way. They would not\r\nadvocate the use of the bomb and the revolver; in fact they might in all\r\nseriousness dissuade people from using them, but when they are used,\r\nthey would not give up the offenders even if they knew who they were.\r\nThey would approve the use of the bomb and the revolver against\r\nindividual tyrants or against people who insult Indian manhood and\r\nwomanhood, as in the present state of racial and political feeling in\r\nIndia no other way is open to bring them to book and get justice against\r\nEnglishmen, but they do not like the use of the bomb and the revolver\r\nfor general political purposes or for terrorising. These people believe\r\nin a propaganda of selfless social service. The people must be\r\napproached and won over by service and love, before any political\r\nupheaval is attempted.\r\n\r\n_Preparing the Nation for Freedom._ Nothing can be achieved without the\r\nhelp of the people. “We must have the people with us,” say they. “And in\r\norder to win the people to our side, we must show them conclusively\r\nthat we have their interests at heart, that we love them perhaps more\r\nthan we love ourselves, that we are disinterested and public spirited\r\nand that we are in every respect better and more honourable than the\r\nforeign rulers. Our moral superiority over the agents of the foreign\r\ngovernment must be ever present in the minds of the people in order to\r\nenable them to support us and back us in the coming political struggle.”\r\nIn their eyes the Congress propaganda has no other value but\r\neducational. They have no faith in the benevolence of British statesmen\r\nand they do not believe that the Congress would achieve anything\r\nsubstantial. They are very uncertain about the future, and therefore to\r\nthem, the best course open is to engage in educational and social work.\r\nThey are neither dreamers nor idealists, but practical patriots, who are\r\ncontent to do the spade work and sow the seed. They confess that they\r\ncan not see far ahead and are therefore afraid of the demoralising\r\ninfluences of the bomb and the revolver. Nor can they justify political\r\nrobberies and dacoities. They think that, this time, independence should\r\ncome never to be lost again, and in their judgment that is only possible\r\nif independence is not won by a few but by the whole united nation. In\r\nthe meantime they would wait and build up their nation.\r\n\r\n_Preparatory Work from Below._ The Congress has failed, they say,\r\nbecause it has been trying to get political concessions from above. The\r\nright policy is to work from below. They do not believe in “mendicancy”;\r\nnor do they place any reliance in “benevolence and philanthropy in\r\npolitics.” On the other hand, they differ from the extremists in their\r\nmethods, as they believe in a steady development of the national mind\r\nand the national will and have no faith in heroic remedies. They do not\r\ncare to run the risk of “relapses.” They contain in their number some of\r\nthe noblest sons of India, whose life is a record of continuous selfless\r\nservice in the field of social work. They should not be confounded with\r\nthe “resolution” patriots of the Social Conferences or other\r\nconferences; nor should they be judged by the length of their speeches\r\nor their fluency or capacity to deliver long orations in English. They\r\nare generally modest people who do not claim erudite scholarship or\r\ngreat statesmanship. They do not go in for any recognition, whether from\r\nthe Government or from the people. The satisfaction of their own\r\nconscience and undisturbed work are the only rewards they seek.\r\n\r\n_Brahmo Samaj, Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna Mission._ They are to be found in\r\nall sections of the great Indian nation, in all religions, and in all\r\ncommunities. They live simply on simple fare, in simple and scanty\r\ngarments and in simple houses. They earn in order to give. They live in\r\norder to serve. To this class belong _some_ of the Bengalee deportees,\r\nand to this class belong a great many members of the Brahmo Samaj, the\r\nArya Samaj, and the Ramakrishna Mission. They have large followings, but\r\nyet their number is by no means great. They are well known in their\r\nrespective circles, but are not so well known outside, as the\r\n“extremists” and “moderates” are. The C. I. D. (Criminal Investigation\r\nDepartment) of the Government keeps a close watch over them; the\r\ngovernment officers keep themselves informed of their movements and\r\ndoings. They want to be left alone and allowed to do their work quietly\r\nand unostentatiously, but the Government will not leave them alone and\r\nsuspects them of deep designs and secret propaganda.\r\n\r\n_The Moderates._ (5) We now come to the moderates. There are some who\r\nwould not advocate the use of the bomb or the revolver, but who do not\r\ndesire the total disappearance of the extremist party; and the\r\noccasional use of the bomb and the revolver gives a point to their\r\norganisation which they would not lose. Lacking the intelligent support\r\nof the masses in their propaganda, being too lazy to court it by\r\nlegitimate means, or too self-centred to run the risk involved therein,\r\nthey are heartily glad of the existence of a party in the country which\r\nhas raised their importance in the eyes of the Government and the\r\nBritish public. Of course they do not say so and their abhorrence and\r\ndetestation of the bomb and the revolver is quite genuine, yet they\r\nwould be very sorry if the extremist party were extirpated altogether.\r\n\r\n_Gokhale._ The noblest and the best of the Congress type from the\r\nNationalist point of view was represented by Mr. Gokhale. Mr. Gokhale\r\nloved his country quite sincerely and lived and worked for it. With the\r\nexception of Dadabhai Naoroji, he was the only Congressman of reputation\r\nand name that\r\n\r\n[Illustration: G. K. GOKHALE]\r\n\r\nlived for his country only and gave his all to her service. His life was\r\nfairly simple; his patriotism was of the highest type; yet he was not\r\nthe type of man fitted to be a hero. He had the qualities of\r\nstatesmanship, but lacked those of generalship. He objected to people\r\ndesignating his policy as one of mendicancy, or questioning his\r\npolitical ideals. He used to remonstrate and say in the most touching\r\nway: “Do you think, my friend, we are so devoid of self-respect and so\r\nbase as to be happy at our country being under foreign domination; do\r\nyou think we wish that it should always remain under foreign yoke? No,\r\nyou do us great injustice if you think so. I would have my country be\r\nfree to-day if that were possible. But is it possible? Can we work on\r\nthat basis? In politics you must consider what is practical and what is\r\nunpractical. We can in no way bind the future generations. Who are we to\r\nbind them irrevocably? We are doing what we in our own times consider\r\nbest and practicable. We are not beggars and our policy is not that of\r\nmendicancy. We are ambassadors of our people at a foreign court, to\r\nwatch and guard the interests of our country and get as much for her as\r\nwe can. That is our position.” Mr. Gokhale believed in the work of\r\nconsolidation and in the work for increasing the social efficiency of\r\nthe people of India regardless of caste, creed, or colour. He had a\r\ngreat deal in common with class number (4). But he had great faith in\r\npolitical agitation on moderate lines. He was fully conscious of the\r\nweakness of the Congress methods and extremely disliked the behaviour\r\nof some of the leaders. He quite bemoaned their lack of enthusiasm,\r\ntheir want of self-sacrifice, their intolerance, the lack of spirit of\r\ntrue comradeship in them, their self-sufficiency and, last but not\r\nleast, their luxurious lives. He often compared the type of human\r\nmaterial which found its way into the Congress with those who joined the\r\nranks of the extremists. He admired the spirit of the latter, their\r\ndevotion to the cause, their asceticism and their selflessness. He\r\nwished he had some of that stuff to work for the Congress. He admired\r\nArabinda and Har Dayal. He used to say that he could not see very far\r\nahead and therefore he preferred to work for the immediate future. A few\r\ndays before his departure from England he said to two of his most\r\nintimate friends (husband and wife) that India would be free in 25\r\nyears. What he meant by freedom we do not know. Probably he meant “as\r\nfree as the self-governed colonies.” Of late he was losing faith in\r\nEnglish liberalism. He noticed the lack of great minds among the\r\nliberals, but he said they were the only people with whom we could work.\r\nHis experiences on the Royal Commission for Public Services saddened the\r\nlast days of his life. He could not bear the insults that witness after\r\nwitness (from among the Anglo-Indians) heaped on his countrymen, their\r\ncharacter, their honesty, and their capacity. He objected to the\r\nextremists calling themselves nationalists to the exclusion of the\r\npeople of his ways of thinking. He said we were all nationalists. He was\r\nby far the noblest of the moderates. There is no one who is even half\r\nso good and noble as he was.\r\n\r\n_Congress Leaders._ A great many Congress leaders are true patriots, but\r\nthey have such an abnormal love of peace and luxury, that they can not\r\neven think of methods which might even remotely result in disturbances\r\nof peace, in riots, and in disasters. Hence their detestation of the\r\nextremist methods and their distrust of carrying on a propaganda among\r\nthe masses. They would proceed very, very slowly. Of course, there are\r\nsome among them who are cowards, some who are self-seekers, who hanker\r\nafter judgeships, memberships, knighthoods, and so on, but we do not\r\ncount them as nationalists, and history knows of no political party\r\nwhich was absolutely free from such weaknesses. There are some among the\r\nCongressmen who are moderates by profession, but extremists in their\r\nways of thinking, lacking the courage of identifying themselves with the\r\nlatter; just as there are some who are Congressmen in name, but are\r\nreally out and out loyalists seeking opportunities of advancing their\r\nown interests. Then there are some who favour constitutional agitation,\r\nbut want to make the Congress more self-assertive and self-sufficient.\r\nThey would pass resolutions on current topics but would have no\r\npetitioning or praying or memorialising.\r\n\r\n_Passive Resisters._ There are others who would go even farther and\r\ninaugurate a campaign of passive resistance and boycott. The Congress\r\nthus claims as many types of nationalists as the extremists. The Passive\r\nResisters are likely to come to the front if Mr. Gandhi, the great\r\nHindu Passive Resister, undertakes to organise them.\r\n\r\nFor obvious reasons we can not classify the living Indian Nationalists\r\nin India by name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nINDIAN NATIONALISM AND THE WORLD-FORCES\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inspiration through European Nationalism._ There can be no doubt that\r\nIndian nationalism is receiving a great deal of support from the\r\nworld-forces operating outside of India. On the political side it has\r\nbeen inspired and strengthened by the forces of European\r\nnationalism--the struggles and successes of the English proletariat, the\r\nsufferings and the eventual triumph of the French revolutionists, the\r\nefforts and victories of the Italians, the continued struggle of\r\nRussians, Poles, Finns, Hungarians, and others. The Indian nationalist\r\nis an ardent student of the history of Modern Europe, of England,\r\nFrance, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, Russia, Austria, and last but not\r\nleast, of Turkey and the Balkan States. The Nationalist Calendar of\r\ngreat men followed by young India contains such names as those of\r\nWashington, Cavour, Mazzini, Bismarck, Kossuth, Emmet, Parnell, by the\r\nside of Partap, Ram Das, Guru Govind Singh, Sivaji, Tipú Sultan, and the\r\nRani of Jhansi.\r\n\r\n_History of Modern Europe tabooed in Universities._ The Indian\r\nGovernment is conscious of this, and some people think this is what is\r\ninfluencing the policy of the Indian universities in tabooing the\r\nhistory of Modern Europe from the courses of studies.\r\n\r\nAmerican literature and American events are also playing their own part\r\nin the influences that are feeding Indian nationalism. The leaders are\r\nand have ever been close students of American literature and the history\r\nof the American Federation. Asia, however, is playing a greater part in\r\nmoulding and influencing Indian nationalism. The Russo-Japanese War\r\nthrilled India to its core. The recognition of Japan as a great power by\r\nthe Concert of Europe is regarded by Young India as the potent factor in\r\nIndian Nationalism. An awakening current passed through the country\r\nelectrifying the most inert, inarticulate and otherwise unapproachable\r\nsections of the populations. Then came the events in Turkey, in Russia,\r\nand in China.\r\n\r\n_Italian-Turko War._ Turkey’s war with Italy, followed by her struggle\r\nwith the Balkan States, has done wonders in nationalising the Indian\r\nMohammedans. At the present moment the Mohammedans perhaps feel even\r\nmore intensely than the Hindus.\r\n\r\nIndian patriots travelling abroad study the current problems of the\r\nvarious countries through which they pass, and note their bearing on\r\ntheir own national problems. But what is most important is, that they\r\nseek and get opportunities of meeting and conversing with the\r\nnationalists of other countries. Some of them are in close touch with\r\nthe Egyptian and Irish nationalists, others with Persians, and so on.\r\nIndian nationalism is thus entering on an international phase which is\r\nbound to strengthen it and bring it into the arena of world forces.\r\n\r\n_Interpretation of India to Western World._ Indian thought, Indian\r\nhistory, and Indian culture are receiving a great deal more attention\r\nnow than they ever did before. There is hardly an important contribution\r\nto the thought of the world which does not notice and consider the\r\nIndian view of the matter under discussion. But India is seen by the\r\nworld only through Western spectacles. Some Indians are doing valuable\r\nwork in interpreting India to the Western world, and their work is\r\nattracting notice; but a great deal yet remains to be done and Indian\r\nscholars should make it an item of their programme to open India and\r\nIndian thought to the outsiders and thus bring India into the vortex of\r\nworld forces.\r\n\r\n_Tagorism._ While Rabindra Nath Tagore is to some degree losing in the\r\nestimation and affection of his own countrymen by somewhat sacrificing\r\nnationalism to art, he is gaining in world reputation. Tagorism is\r\nbecoming a cult and he is at the present moment perhaps the most popular\r\nand most widely read and widely admired literary man in the world. It\r\nwas a mere chance that his work attracted the notice of the trustees of\r\nthe Nobel prize trust. He himself did nothing to attract their notice.\r\n\r\nThe Indian publicist has so far lived in a world of his own. He has\r\nignored or paid very scanty attention to the forces operating in the\r\nworld for progress, for liberty, and for advance in democratic ways. The\r\nleaders of the National Congress have never tried to enlist sympathy\r\nfor their cause anywhere outside England. They have never realised the\r\nvalue of the world forces and the great sensitiveness of the English as\r\nto what the world thinks and says of them.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Nationalist would do well to note this. He should begin to\r\nthink and act internationally. It is impossible to separate India\r\naltogether from the rest of the world, however the British might try and\r\nwhatever they might do. For her sons to try to do that is to strengthen\r\ntheir chains and add to the weight which is crushing their country.\r\nNothing could be more suicidal or more short-sighted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE RELIGIOUS AND THE COMMUNAL ELEMENTS IN INDIAN NATIONALISM\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a time the Mohammedan minority was the hope of the British\r\nGovernment in India. As far back as 1888, Lord Dufferin[92] and Sir\r\nAuckland Colvin had successfully appealed to their fears, and won them\r\nover by promises of preferential treatment. That policy has been\r\nconsistently followed since then, and so far has been a great success.\r\nThe bulk of the educated Mohammedans has opposed the Congress, in order\r\nto please the Government and win their gratitude; they also opposed the\r\n_Swadeshi_ Movement, although the success of the _Swadeshi_ was likely\r\nto benefit them very materially, since the handloom industry was\r\nprincipally in their hands. In return, they received substantial\r\nbenefits in the shape of large grants of money for educational purposes,\r\na larger percentage of posts in government service, a larger number of\r\ntitles and honours, a separate and larger representation in the\r\ncouncils, and so on. Lord Morley confirmed this policy of preference by\r\nmaking it a special feature of his Reform scheme in 1908. So the\r\nMohammedans were in very high spirits in 1908. The Nationalist party in\r\nBengal had a large number of friends and sympathisers among the\r\nMohammedans, but as compared with the Separatist party, their number was\r\nvery small and meagre. In its inception and for some time thereafter the\r\nNationalist movement in India was thus a pre-eminently Hindu movement.\r\n\r\n_Mohammedan Revulsion of Feeling against the British._ The world events\r\nof the last four years, however, have changed the whole aspect of\r\naffairs in India. The events in Turkey, in Tripoli, in Egypt and in\r\nPersia have affected the Mohammedans deeply and have brought about a\r\nrevulsion of feeling against the British. The Muslims are a virile and\r\nproud people. The attitude of Britain towards Turkey has offended their\r\ndeepest susceptibilities and they have begun to think that the British\r\nin India wanted to bribe them into silent acquiescence in what was\r\nhappening to the Muslim people in the other parts of the globe. For the\r\nlast four years the Muslim press has been carrying on a strong, vigorous\r\npan-Islamic propaganda. The Mohammedan classes as well as masses are\r\nfull of veiled and subdued hatred of the British. Sometimes this finds\r\nexpression on the platform, in the press, and in permanent literature\r\nalso. In the last Balkan war and during Turkey’s conflict with Italy\r\nabout Tripoli, the Mohammedan mosques rang with loud prayers for the\r\nvictory of Turkey, and with strong and open denunciation of their\r\nChristian enemies. There is a perceptible and clear change in the\r\npolitical pronouncements of the Muslim League,[93] but the political\r\ninfluence of the Muslim League among the people was, so far, little as\r\ncompared with the influence of the Pan-Islamic party. This Pan-Islamic\r\nparty is the extreme wing of the Mohammedan Nationalists.\r\n\r\nThe number of forfeitures of the Moslem papers and publications under\r\nthe Press Act, the nature of those publications and the continued\r\nsupport given to the papers that have been more than once forfeited and\r\npunished by the Government, the change in the tone of the Moslem papers\r\nin their comments on government measures, and the newly born _entente_\r\nbetween the Hindus and Mohammedans, of which there is unmistakable proof\r\nin the press as well as in actual life, all point in the same direction.\r\nThere is every chance of the Hindu extremists and Muslim extremists\r\nmaking an alliance and joining hands, while even the Mohammedan\r\nmoderates are coming nearer the Hindu moderates.[94] The former may not\r\nactually join the Congress in large numbers, but they are thinking and\r\nacting the same way. The Mohammedan moderates are wiser than the Hindu\r\nmoderates. They use their extreme party as a trump card in their\r\nnegotiations with the Government more effectively than the Hindus do or\r\nhave ever done. The Mohammedan extremist receives more substantial\r\nsupport and sympathy from his moderate co-religionist than the Hindu\r\nextremist does from the Hindu moderates. The Mohammedan moderate is\r\nmore outspoken in his criticism of government measures that injuriously\r\naffect the Mohammedans; he is less lavish in his praises of the British\r\nRaj; he is a more skilful negotiator and a decidedly better and more\r\nsuccessful diplomat.\r\n\r\nThe educated Mohammedans, outside India, are almost to a man identified\r\nwith Indian Nationalism. So the Indian Mohammedan’s changed sentiments\r\ntowards the British are likely to be a source of great strength to the\r\nnational cause and make the situation more hopeful from the point of\r\nview of Indian Nationalism.\r\n\r\n_Disaffection among the Sikhs._ But the Mohammedans were not the only\r\npeople whom the Britishers had succeeded in keeping aloof from the Hindu\r\nNationalists. The Sikhs had also so far kept aloof. The treatment of the\r\nSikhs in Canada, the _Komagata Maru_[95] incident and the influence of\r\nHar Dayal and the Gadar party on the Pacific Coast of America formed by\r\nhim, have affected a great change of feeling among the Sikhs also. The\r\nGovernment may try to win them back by making concessions and conferring\r\npreferments, but a move like the one recently made in giving Mr. K. G.\r\nGupta’s seat on the Secretary of State’s Council in London to Sirdar\r\nDaljit Singh, a Sikh nobleman, is likely to make them look even more\r\nridiculous than before. The Britisher’s lack of imagination is\r\ncolossal, but we did not know that the war was likely to affect even his\r\nsense of humour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is both difficult and risky to predict, especially concerning a\r\ncountry situated as India is to-day. It is always the unexpected that\r\nhappens in human affairs. This is particularly true where human affairs\r\nare so complicated and complex as in India. It is perhaps easier to\r\npredict the future of America or England, than that of India. The Indian\r\nnationalists of the nineties, or even of the early days of the new\r\ncentury, could hardly have imagined the developments of the last fifteen\r\nyears. It is true that India is rather immobile; its masses are rather\r\ninert; and perhaps of all peoples the least affected by changes in the\r\noutside world. They have been under the benumbing influence of a\r\nphilosophy of life which keeps them contented even under adverse\r\ncircumstances, even when they are starving and have no clothes to hide\r\ntheir nakedness.\r\n\r\n_Change in Indian Life and Depth of Nationalism._ But this is only\r\npartially true of modern India. There is a great deal of exaggeration\r\nabout the immobility of Indian people. There may be millions in India\r\nwho are as unaffected by modern conditions of life and modern ideas as\r\nthey were fifty years ago, but then there are millions who have\r\nconsciously awakened. Their strength is not to be judged by the\r\nattendance at Congresses and conferences or other public meetings or\r\ndemonstrations, nor by the circulation of newspapers or books. Popular\r\ndemonstrations organised in honour of popular leaders, and the increase\r\nin the circulation of newspapers give indications of a great change in\r\nIndian life, but the actual change is even much greater. Read the poetry\r\nof the country or its prose, read the rough versifyings of the\r\nhalf-educated or even uneducated men and women (including some who are\r\neven illiterate), listen to the talk in the village park or square or\r\nother meeting places, see the games which the children of rustics and\r\nthe poorest classes play, attend to the patterings of children, examine\r\nthe popular songs or the music that is now in demand, then you will see\r\nhow deeply nationalism has pervaded Indian life and what a strong hold\r\nit has gained in the thoughts of the people. No foreigner can realise\r\nthat; only an Indian can properly understand it. Examine the vernacular\r\npress--the most sober and the most loyal papers, and underlying the\r\nexpressions of deepest loyalty, you would assuredly come across genuine\r\ntears of blood, shed for the misfortune of the country, its decline, its\r\npresent wretched and miserable condition. From the Indian press we hear\r\na never-ceasing lamentation. Listen to the utterances of the most wanton\r\nchief, and the most callous millionaire, bring him out from his\r\nisolation or retirement, put him on the public platform, and you will\r\nnotice a vein of nationalism in his thoughts and in his words. But if\r\nyou can know what he talks in private to friends from whom he keeps no\r\nsecrets, you will see and notice a great deal more. The writer has not\r\nso far met a single Indian of any class--he has met Indians of all\r\nclasses and of all shades of opinions, educated, uneducated, prince and\r\npeasant, moderate and extremist, loyalist and seditionist,--who was\r\ngenuinely sorry at the outbreak of this war. A number of Indians are\r\nfighting at the front. They are sincerely loyal and true to their oath\r\nof allegiance. They would leave nothing undone to win, but in their\r\nheart of hearts lurks something which in moments of reflection or when\r\nthey are off duty, reminds them of the wrongs which they and their\r\ncountrymen are suffering at the hands of England. Nationalism is no\r\nlonger confined to the classes. It promises to become a universal cult.\r\nIt is permeating the masses. Only those Indians realise it who mix with\r\nthe people and do not derive their knowledge from works written by\r\nEnglishmen or by other arm-chair politicians. No foreigner, however kind\r\nand sympathetic, however great his knowledge of the language of the\r\ncountry, can ever realise it fully. Even the dancing girls are affected\r\nby it. They will sing political or national songs if you so wish. Even\r\nthe wandering minstrel with his rude, one-stringed instrument, knows the\r\nsong that is likely to bring him help.\r\n\r\n_Nationalism Fertilised by Blood of Martyrs._ No amount of repression or\r\nespionage can stop it. No amount of official terrorism and no devices,\r\ninvented or followed to inculcate loyalty, can stop or check the flow\r\nof the new feeling of patriotism and nationalism which is being\r\nconstantly fed by the sentences of death and transportation that the\r\nBritish courts are passing on beardless youths. The Government can not\r\nhelp it. They must punish the offender and the criminal. They must hunt\r\nup the seditionist. They would not be a government if they would do\r\notherwise, but India is now in that stage and Indian nationalism is in\r\nthat condition when repression, death sentences, and imprisonments are\r\nmore beneficial to it than otherwise. The more it is repressed and\r\nsuppressed, the more this spirit grows and spreads. It is a seed that is\r\nrichly fertilised by the blood of martyrs. The people do not argue, they\r\ndo not reason, they do not analyse; they feel that good, well-connected,\r\nhealthy, beautiful boys are dying in the country’s cause and to get a\r\nredress of the country’s wrongs. When a bomb is thrown, the people\r\ngenuinely condemn the bomb thrower, are sincere in their detestation,\r\nbut when he is hanged or transported, they are sorry for him. Their\r\noriginal abhorrence changes into sympathy and then into love. They are\r\nmartyrs of the national cause. They may be misguided, even mad, but they\r\nare martyrs all the same. The moralist and the legalist and the loyalist\r\nand the constitutionalist, all condemn their deeds, but the doers\r\nthemselves, they adore, and their names they enshrine in their hearts.\r\n\r\n_Wave of Indian Nationalism is on._ Such is human psychology, and such\r\nis the psychology of nations in the making. The Indian mind has entered\r\non that phase. No amount of sweet speeches by the Viceroy or by the\r\nLieutenant Governors or by the commissioners or deputy commissioners, no\r\namount of honours and titles or rewards to individuals, no amount of\r\npreferment of one community as against another, no amount of\r\ncanal-making or railway-developing, can change the tide that has begun\r\nto flow, or retard the sweep, much less turn it to ebb.\r\n\r\n_Propitiation and Petty Concessions Futile._ This is the supreme fact of\r\nIndian life which every one who has anything to do with India, official\r\nor non-official, statesman or layman, politician or publicist, must\r\nrecognise and face. Nations and individuals, filled with their own\r\nimportance, drunk with power and resources, accustomed to mould things\r\nand forces in their own way, determined to keep what they have got, may\r\nnot see things which are unpleasant to look at or to think about. But\r\nfacts are facts and do not wait for their action on the pleasure of\r\nthose who do not like them. Canute-like they may command the waves, but\r\nthe waves will not listen to them. The wave of Indian nationalism is on\r\nand no amount of tinkering with Indian administration, or sweet phrases,\r\nor promises can check it. “We are the subjects of the same sovereign,”\r\n“citizens of the same empire,” “brothers in arms,” “comrades,” and so\r\non,--these are kind words spoken by people who perhaps mean well. But in\r\nthe light of past experience they do not carry much weight; they may\r\nbefool some soft-hearted people, but they would not affect the general\r\nmind of the nation so long as they remain unaccompanied by deeds. An\r\nExecutive Council for the United Provinces, a High Court for the Punjab,\r\na High Court and a University for Behar, a Charter to the Hindu\r\nUniversity, liberal grants to Islamic schools and colleges, may please\r\nsome barristers and pleaders, but they will not satisfy the nation, so\r\nlong as the Arms Act is on the statute book, so long as the Indian\r\nCouncils are a farce, so long as the fiscal policy is laid down in the\r\ninterests of Lancashire, and so long as hundreds and thousands of Indian\r\nboys fail to earn a decent living, while the country is being ruled and\r\nexploited by the few fortunate foreigners. Indians want to go to Canada,\r\nto South Africa, to the United States of America, because the wages to\r\nbe earned in India are so low, because the life at home is so miserable,\r\nso helpless and so hard and so humiliating. Even abroad the Indian is\r\nkicked and insulted at almost every step, but then that is more easily\r\nborne than the kicks and insults of Englishmen in India.\r\n\r\n_Internal Division no Valid Plea._ India has and can produce enough to\r\nfeed her own children,[96] nay to spare, provided she were free to make\r\nher own laws, spend her own revenues, and protect her industries. Those\r\nwho plead that Indians are too hopelessly divided into religions,\r\ncommunities, sects, castes, and languages, to be able to form a\r\ngovernment of their own, forget that the English have been in India only\r\nfor the last century and a half and that before that India governed\r\nherself. The India of to-day is in no way happier than it was before\r\npre-British days. The India of Akbar was happier than the England of\r\nElizabeth and even more prosperous. The India of Asoka was infinitely\r\nhappier and more prosperous than the England of Alfred the Great. The\r\nIndia of Aurangzeb may perhaps have been miserable, but surely not more\r\nmiserable than the England of Henry VIII, or the England of James I, or\r\nthe Scotland of Mary, or the Ireland of Cromwell, or the France of Henry\r\nIV, or the Holland of Philip. We have the testimony of English\r\nhistorians and observers that subjects of the East India Company were in\r\nno way happier or more prosperous than when they were under Native\r\nrule,[97] and the subjects of Native States in India governed by Natives\r\nare on the whole in no way worse off than British subjects under the\r\ndirect rule of the British.\r\n\r\nLook at the United States, how the varied races, sects, religions, and\r\ncommunities have merged their differences and live under one national\r\ngovernment; look at the number of languages spoken in the United\r\nStates--in their schools and in their factories. Look at Switzerland,\r\nwhat a tiny little country it is! How many languages are spoken and\r\ntaught in its schools and how many languages are spoken and used in its\r\ncouncils, and how many religions are professed by the people of the\r\ncountry!\r\n\r\nThe same remarks may be made about the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary,\r\nwhere the form of government is largely representative in spite of the\r\ndiversity of races, sects and languages.\r\n\r\nThe number of religions, sects and languages in India has been grossly\r\nexaggerated. With every census the number goes up by hundreds, though\r\nthe country and the people are the same.\r\n\r\n_Illiteracy the Fault of the British and no Bar to Self-government._\r\nAgain it is sometimes said that India cannot be self-ruling because of\r\nits illiteracy. This argument does not come with good grace from the\r\nBritishers because it is they who are responsible for the appalling\r\nilliteracy of the Indian population. In Japan, where the work of\r\neducation was begun late in the last century, 28 per cent. of the\r\nchildren of school age were at school in 1873; by 1902-1903 the\r\npercentage had risen to 90. In India, after 150 years of British rule,\r\nthe percentage is 19.6. The Indian Nationalists have for a number of\r\nyears been asking for compulsory universal education, but the Government\r\nwould not listen. The late Mr. Gokhale’s Compulsory Elementary Education\r\nBill was strongly opposed by the Government and thrown out. But what is\r\neven worse is that the Government would not let the people open their\r\nown schools and colleges because of the unreasonably high standard set\r\nup by the Department for their recognition as public schools.\r\n\r\nHowever, universal literacy of the people is not an indispensable\r\npre-requisite of self-rule. In Japan, where 50 years ago representative\r\ngovernment was set up, only the _Samurai_ were literate. In India, too,\r\nthe higher classes are educated to a considerable extent.\r\n\r\nEngland has enjoyed parliamentary government for centuries, but\r\nuniversal education was only introduced in 1870.\r\n\r\n_Internal Troubles._ As for internal troubles following the withdrawal\r\nof the British or the grant of self-government we ask, “Is there any\r\ncountry on the face of the earth which is free from internal troubles?”\r\nEven Great Britain is not; much less are the self-governing colonies.\r\nYet nobody questions their right to govern themselves. Only the other\r\nday President Wilson considered the existence of internal disorder in\r\nMexico to be no justification for the United States interfering in its\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n_Unfitness of Orientals for Representative Institutions._ As for the\r\nunfitness of Orientals for democratic institutions, why the ancient\r\nhistory of India refutes it almost conclusively. India was the home of\r\ndemocratic institutions long before England and France had any notion of\r\nwhat democracy implied. But if any further proof of the absurdity of\r\nthis plea was needed that has been furnished by Japan.\r\n\r\n_Nationalism has come to Stay._ Let England try an experiment by\r\nrepealing the Arms Act and giving a parliamentary government to India\r\nand see if these considerations effectively stand in the way of\r\nprogress. Be that as it may, however, one thing seems to be assured and\r\ncertain, that Indian nationalism can neither be killed nor suppressed\r\nby repression, nor by minor concessions. Nationalism has come to stay\r\nand will stay. What will be the upshot is only known to the Gods.\r\nEngland may win or lose in the great war in which she is engaged. Indian\r\nnationalism will gain in either case. We need not consider how India\r\nwill fare if England loses. She may come under Mohammedan domination, or\r\nthe Germans may take possession of her; the English would be gone and\r\nthen India would enter upon a new life. India does not want it. She will\r\nresist it with all her strength. But if it comes she can’t help it and\r\nGreat Britain would be responsible for having brought it. In case,\r\nhowever, England wins, as she is likely to, the Indian nationalism will\r\nstill gain. There will be a demand for political advance, for a change\r\nin the political status of the country and in its relations towards\r\nEngland and her colonies. From what we know of English temper, of\r\nEnglish political machinery, of English political methods, of English\r\nways and of English history, that demand is sure to be refused. Some\r\nminor, petty concessions may be made, but they would be disproportionate\r\nto the sacrifices of men and money that India is making in the war. They\r\nwill not satisfy the country. Disaffection and discontent will grow and\r\nthat is the kind of food on which nationalism thrives and prospers. So\r\nlong as there are Curzons, Macdonnels, and Sydenhams in the English\r\nParliament, Indian nationalism will not starve for want of congenial\r\nfood. And we have no reason to think that these dignitaries of the\r\nBritish Government are likely to disappear.\r\n\r\n_Curzons, Macdonnels, Sydenhams, responsible for Bombs and Revolvers._\r\nThese persons are directly responsible for the appearance of bombs and\r\nrevolvers in Indian political life. The young men who use them are mere\r\ntools of circumstances. If any persons deserve to be hanged for the use\r\nof these destructive machines by Indian nationalists, it is they. It is\r\na pity that while the latter are dying by tens on the scaffold, the\r\nformer should be free to carry on their propaganda of racial\r\ndiscrimination, racial hatred, and social preferment. But the ways of\r\nProvidence are inscrutable. It is perhaps some higher dispensation that\r\nis using these miserable Junkers for its own purposes. Indians have\r\nfaith in Providence and they believe that what is happening is for the\r\nbest. The Indians are a chivalrous people; they will not disturb England\r\nas long as she is engaged with Germany. The struggle after the war\r\nmight, however, be even more bitter and more sustained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    A SHORT BIBLIOGRAPHY OF BOOKS IN ENGLISH\r\n\r\n             BOOKS BY ENGLISHMEN\r\n\r\n\r\n     “New Spirit in India” by H.

They are powerless to protect themselves. There is\r\nno judicial authority to which they can appeal. There is no public\r\nopinion to watch their interests. Technically independent under the\r\nsuzerainty of the Empire, they are practically held in complete\r\nsubjection. Their rank and honours depend on the pleasure of a British\r\nResident at their Court, and on the secret and irresponsible mandates of\r\na Foreign Office at Simla” (page 34).\r\n\r\n_Gross Insults to Indians._ “That intense Anglo-Saxon spirit of\r\nself-approbation which is unpleasantly perceptible in England itself,\r\nand is so often offensive among vulgar Englishmen on the Continent, very\r\nsoon becomes rampant in India.\r\n\r\n“There are innumerable instances in which pedestrians have been abused\r\nand struck because they have not lowered their umbrellas at the sight of\r\na sahib on the highway. There are few Indian gentlemen even of the\r\nhighest rank who have not had experience of gross insults when\r\ntravelling by railway, because Englishmen object to sit in the same\r\ncarriage with a native” (pages 68-69).\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSOME OPINIONS ABOUT BRITISH INDIA\r\n\r\n_Industrial Ruin of India. Gokhale._ “When we come to this question of\r\nIndia’s Industrial domination by England, we come to what may be\r\ndescribed as the most deplorable result of British rule in this country.\r\nIn other matters there are things on the credit side and things on the\r\ndebit side.... But when you come to the industrial field, you will find\r\nthat the results have been disastrous. You find very little here on the\r\ncredit side and nearly all the entries on the debit side. Now this is a\r\nserious statement to make, but I think it can be substantiated.”\r\n\r\n_India a Mere Possession. Gokhale._ “India formed the largest part of\r\nthe Empire, but was governed as a mere possession of the British people.\r\nThree features showed that it had no part or lot in the Empire. In the\r\nfirst place, the people were kept disarmed; it was thought to be\r\ndangerous to allow them to carry arms. Secondly, they had absolutely no\r\nvoice in the government of their own country; they were expressly\r\ndisqualified from holding certain high offices, and practically excluded\r\nfrom others. Lastly, they were not allowed a share in the privileges of\r\nthe Empire in any portion outside British India, except a limited one in\r\nthe United Kingdom itself.”--MR. GOKHALE.\r\n\r\n_Masses Starved. Sir C. A. Elliott._ “I do not hesitate to say that half\r\nour agricultural population never know from year’s end to year’s end\r\nwhat it is to have their hunger fully satisfied.”--SIR C. A. ELLIOTT,\r\none-time Lieut.-Governor of Bengal.\r\n\r\n_Sir W. W. Hunter._ In 1880. “There remain forty millions of people who\r\ngo through life on insufficient food.”--SIR W. W. HUNTER.\r\n\r\n_William Digby._ In 1893. The _Pioneer_ sums up Mr. Grierson’s facts\r\nregarding the various sections of the population in Gaya: “Briefly, it\r\nis that all the persons of the labouring classes, and ten per cent. of\r\nthe cultivating and artisan classes, or forty-five per cent. of the\r\ntotal population, are insufficiently clothed, or insufficiently fed, or\r\nboth. In Gaya district this would give about a million persons without\r\nsufficient means of support. If we assume that the circumstances of Gaya\r\nare not exceptional,--and there is no reason for thinking otherwise--it\r\nfollows that nearly one hundred millions of people in British India are\r\nliving in extreme poverty.”\r\n\r\nIn 1901. “The poverty and suffering of the people are such as to defy\r\ndescription. In fact, for nearly fifteen years there has been _a\r\ncontinuous famine in India_ owing to high prices.”\r\n\r\n70,000,000 _Continually Hungry People in British India. W. Digby._\r\n“Since Sir William Hunter’s remarks were made the population has\r\nincreased (or is alleged to have increased) by nearly thirty millions.\r\nMeanwhile the income of the Empire has greatly decreased during this\r\nperiod. Wherefore this follows: that is, if with the same income, in\r\n1880 forty millions were insufficiently fed, the additional millions\r\ncannot have had, cannot now have, enough to eat; this, again, ensues:--\r\n\r\n40,000,000 plus, say, 30,000,000, make 70,000,000; and _there are this\r\nnumber of continually hungry people in British India at the beginning of\r\nthe Twentieth Century_.”--WILLIAM DIGBY, C. I. E.\r\n\r\n_Deaths from Famine or Consequent Diseases, 1891 to 1900 alone_:\r\nestimated by a correspondent of the _Lancet_, 19,000,000.\r\n\r\n_Total area under cultivation._ In the year 1911-12, the _total area_\r\nunder _food grains_ was over 195 _million acres_, plus 7.5, _i.e._ over\r\n202½ _million acres_. In 1912-13, India _exported foodstuffs_ of the\r\nvalue of over 260 million dollars.\r\n\r\nIn 1913-14 she exported about 216 million dollars’ worth of foodstuffs.\r\n\r\n_Famines of Money, not Food. Lord G. Hamilton._ “The recent famines are\r\nfamines of money, and not of food.”--LORD G. HAMILTON, former Secretary\r\nof State.\r\n\r\n_Causes of Famines._ 1. National industries deliberately crushed by the\r\nEast India Co. cannot revive under existing conditions.\r\n\r\n2. Annual drain of India.\r\n\r\n3. Lack of such education as will enable people to develop their\r\nresources.\r\n\r\n_Drain. Montgomery Martin._ “The annual drain of £3,000,000 from British\r\nIndia has mounted in thirty years, at 12 per cent. (the usual Indian\r\nrate) compound interest, to the enormous sum of £723,900,000\r\nsterling.”--MONTGOMERY MARTIN. (In 1830.)\r\n\r\n_Digby._ “During the last thirty years of the century the average drain\r\ncannot have been far short of £30,000,000 per year, or, in the thirty\r\nyears, £900,000,000, not reckoning interest!”--SIR WILLIAM DIGBY.\r\n\r\n_Enormous Foreign Tribute. Rev. J. T. Sunderland._ Rev. J. T. Sunderland\r\nin his work “The Causes of Famine in India,” like all impartial writers,\r\nhas conclusively proved that neither “failure of rains” nor “over\r\npopulation” is the cause of famines in India. He has stated that the\r\nreal cause of famine is the extreme, the abject, the awful poverty of\r\nthe Indian people caused by “_Enormous Foreign Tribute_,” “British\r\nIndian Imperialism” and the destruction of Indian industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Government assessment too high. Sir W. Hunter._ “The government\r\nassessment does not leave enough food to the cultivator to support\r\nhimself and his family throughout the year.”--SIR WILLIAM HUNTER, K. C.\r\nS. I., in the Viceroy’s Council, 1883.\r\n\r\n_The Ryot. Herbert Compton._ “There is no more pathetic figure in the\r\nBritish Empire than the Indian peasant. His masters have ever been\r\nunjust to him. He is ground until everything has been expressed, except\r\nthe marrow of his bones.”--MR. HERBERT COMPTON in “Indian Life,” 1904.\r\n\r\nHindustan is an extensive agricultural country and the average land\r\nproduces two crops a year, and in Bengal there are lands which produce\r\nthrice a year. Bengal alone produces such large crops that they are\r\nquite sufficient to provide _all the population of Hindustan for two\r\nyears_.\r\n\r\n_Indian Plunder. Adam Brooks._ Adam Brooks says, (“Laws of Civilization\r\nand Decay,” page 259-246) “Very soon after the Battle of Plassey (fought\r\nin 1757) the Bengal Plunder began to arrive in London and the effect\r\nappears to have been almost instantaneous. Probably since the world\r\nbegan, no investment has yielded the profit reaped from the Indian\r\nplunder. The amount of treasure wrung from the conquered people and\r\ntransferred from India to English banks between Plassey and Waterloo (57\r\nyears) has been variously estimated at from $2,500,000,000 to\r\n$5,000,000,000. The methods of plunder and embezzlement, by which every\r\nBriton in India enriched himself during the earlier history of the East\r\nIndia Company, gradually passed away, but the drain did not pass away.\r\nThe difference between that earlier day and the present is, that India’s\r\ntribute to England is obtained by “indirect methods,” under forms of\r\nlaw. It is estimated by Mr. Hyndman that at least $175,000,000 is\r\ndrained away every year from India, without a cent’s return.”\r\n\r\n_Swami Abhedananda._ “India pays interest on England’s debt, which in\r\n1900 amounted to 244 millions sterling, and which annually increases.\r\nBesides this, she pays for all the officers, civil and military, and a\r\nhuge standing army, pensions of officers, and even the cost of the India\r\nBuilding in London, as well as the salary of every menial servant of\r\nthat house. For 1901-2 the total expenditure charged against revenue was\r\n$356,971,410.00, out of which $84,795,515.00 was spent in England as\r\nHome Charges, not including the pay of European officers in India, saved\r\nand remitted to England.--SWAMI ABHEDANANDA (“India and Her People”).\r\n\r\n_Alfred Webb_ (late M.P.): “In charges for the India Office (in\r\nLondon); for recruiting (in Great Britain, for soldiers to serve in\r\nIndia); for civil and military pensions (to men now living in England,\r\nwho were formerly in the Indian service); for pay and allowances on\r\nfurloughs (to men on visits to England); for private remittances and\r\nconsignments (for India to England); for interest on Indian debt (paid\r\nto parties in England); and for interest on railways and other works\r\n(paid to shareholders in England), there is annually drawn from India\r\nand spent in the United Kingdom, a sum calculated at from £25,000,000 to\r\n£30,000,000 (Between $125,000,000 and $150,000,000).”\r\n\r\n“_Narrow and Shortsighted Imperial Policy._” _Sir Archibald R.\r\nColquehoun._ “The present condition of affairs undoubtedly renders the\r\nstruggle for existence a hard one, as may be realized when it is\r\nconsidered that a vast population of India not only from the inevitable\r\ndroughts which so frequently occur, _but also from a narrow and\r\nshortsighted imperial policy which places every obstacle in the way of\r\nIndustrial development and imposes heavy taxes on the struggling\r\npeople_. According to various authorities, Russia’s demand upon\r\nlandowners in her Central Asian possession are not so exacting as ours\r\nin India, _for the British Government insists on a fifth of the produce,\r\nmaking no allowance for good or bad years; while Russia is said to ask\r\nonly a tenth and allow for variation of production_.” (Pages 135-6,\r\n“Russia Against India,” by SIR ARCHIBALD R. COLQUEHOUN, Gold Medalist,\r\nRoyal Geographical Society.)\r\n\r\n_Taxation. Lord Salisbury._ The British policy of bleeding Indian\r\npeople. “The injury is exaggerated in the case of India where so much of\r\nthe revenue is exported without a direct equivalent. As India must be\r\nbled, the lancet should be directed to the parts where the blood is\r\ncongested or at least sufficient, not to those already feeble for the\r\nwant of it.”--LORD SALISBURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nFACTS AND FIGURES\r\n\r\n_Plague, Deaths from._ Plague[98] deaths from 1897-1913: 7,251,257.\r\n\r\n_Death Rate._ Death rate was: 34.28 for the year 1907-11; 32 for the\r\nyear 1911, and 29.71 for the year 1912.\r\n\r\nRural from 41.8 to 23.5.\r\n\r\nUrban from 47.6 to 22.7.\r\n\r\n_Indian Finance._ The budget figures of the government of India for\r\n1914-15 show the total estimated income for the year to be slightly over\r\n85 millions sterling, of which more than 17 millions are given out as\r\nrailway receipts and about 4½ millions for irrigation work, thus leaving\r\nthe pure revenue to be about 63 millions.\r\n\r\n_Land Tax._ The principal source of revenue is the land tax, which alone\r\nfurnishes a little over 21½ millions of pounds, of which, if we deduct 9\r\nmillions shown as the “direct demand on the revenues” only 12½ millions\r\nare left for general purposes.\r\n\r\nThe military expenses alone are estimated at about 22 millions, which is\r\neven in excess of the gross total receipts from the land tax, and is\r\nmore than one-third of the total revenues from all sources.\r\n\r\nThe figures for income are a little misleading, because out of a total\r\nof about 17 millions (17 millions and 33 thousand) shown as railway\r\nreceipts about 13 millions (13,409,000) shown as paid for interest and\r\nother miscellaneous charges on the expenditure side, should be deducted.\r\nSimilarly about 4½ millions are shown as receipts under the head of\r\nirrigation, and over 3½ millions are shown against that head as\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\nAmong the other heads of income, excise brings slightly over 9\r\nmillions. Income tax is included under “Other Heads,” which show a total\r\nfigure of slightly over 5 millions.\r\n\r\n_Income Tax._ The income tax, which is levied on incomes other than\r\nthose derived from agriculture, is only 6½d. in a pound on incomes of\r\n£133 or more, a year, and almost 5d. a pound on incomes below that\r\nfigure. The minimum taxable income is £66 a year, which shows that all\r\nincomes of between 5-6 pounds a month, or between 25-30 dollars a month,\r\nare taxed. The large fortunes made by Europeans and Indians by trade,\r\nspeculation, manufacture, and unearned increments of valuation, are thus\r\neasily let off. The principle burden of taxation falls on the poor\r\n_ryot_.\r\n\r\nIncome from agriculture is supposed to be taxed at the rate of 50 per\r\ncent. of the net income of the landlord, or at the rate of 20 per cent.\r\nof the gross produce of the ryot, under the ryotwari system. In some\r\ncases it exceeds these proportions and is as high as 65 per cent. (See\r\nLord Morley’s reply to C. T. O’Donnell.)\r\n\r\n_Customs._ Customs, which furnish the principal source of revenue in the\r\nUnited States and Germany, in India only yield about less than 7½\r\nmillions. The imports are charged _ad valorem_ duty of 5 per cent. with\r\nspecial conditions as to textiles, and “a large free list.” The textile\r\nwoven goods pay a duty of 3½ per cent. and Lancashire is protected by a\r\ncorresponding excise duty on textile goods produced in the country. Iron\r\nand steel pay only a nominal duty of one per cent.\r\n\r\nThe other principal source of revenue is the drink traffic, from which\r\nthe government of India makes an income of about _nine millions_\r\nsterling. How much loss in morals it inflicts thereby on the country may\r\nbetter be imagined. That however is another story.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRADE FIGURES FOR 1913 to 1914\r\n\r\n  Imports (manufactured articles forming\r\n  80 per cent. of the total):                 £127 millions\r\n\r\n  _Treasure_:                                   29 millions\r\n                                              -------------\r\n                                              £156 millions\r\n\r\n  _Exports_ (chiefly raw produce and articles\r\n  of food):                                   £163 millions\r\n\r\nThe shipping is entirely in European hands and it would be interesting\r\nto enquire how much does India pay for the shipping of its imports and\r\nexports, and how much do the foreigners make by way of insurance and\r\nother charges. The exact gain to Great Britain and other European\r\ncountries from Indian trade is simply incalculable. The great bulk of\r\nthe foreign trade on both sides is in the hands of foreigners.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONNEL OF THE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n     SECRETARY OF STATE and all Under Secretaries, as well as Assistant\r\n     Under Secretaries:\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _British_\r\n  COUNCIL:  _British_  _Indians_  _Total_\r\n                8          2         10\r\n\r\nAll Office Establishment and Secretaries: _British_.\r\n\r\nAll salaries and other expenses paid by India.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR GENERAL AND COUNCIL _and staff_ (i.e., the British Indian\r\nCabinet).\r\n\r\n     Members of the _Executive Council_: British 7; one only is an\r\n     Indian.\r\n\r\n     REVENUE AND AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT: All Secretaries down to the\r\n     Superintendent of the Office: British.

Mr. Macleod, the city magistrate of Nagpur, has sentenced him\r\nto an additional six months of rigorous imprisonment after his sentence\r\nhas expired for ‘refusing to work.’ Our readers will remember the case.\r\nThis unfortunate political prisoner--whose analogues in foreign\r\ncountries have been welcomed and protected on British soil--under-going\r\na sentence of imprisonment, was so brutally flogged for refusing to do\r\nwork, which he says was more than he could do, that the prison doctor\r\nadmits that he would have been unable to work for four days after the\r\nflogging, and six weeks after it the skin was still discoloured and two\r\nserious scars remained. Now he has a heavy sentence of six months’\r\nadditional imprisonment. Is this British treatment of a political\r\nprisoner? Why did Britons protest against the use of the knout on\r\npolitical prisoners in Russia? Is there no one in the House of Commons\r\nwho will ask a question on this case, and demand an enquiry into the\r\ntreatment of political prisoners in India?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nAbul Fazal, 52\r\n\r\nAbul Qasim, 70\r\n\r\nAhmad Khan (Sir Syed), 115\r\n\r\nAkbar, 71, 72, 73, 74\r\n\r\nAlberuni, 52\r\n\r\nAlexander the Great, 68\r\n\r\nAl-Hilal, 62\r\n\r\nAsoka, 9, 11, 12, 69\r\n\r\nAurangzeb, 52, 73, 95\r\n\r\n\r\nB\r\n\r\nBall, Charles (Indian Mutiny), 105\r\n\r\nBankim, Chandra, 190, 191\r\n\r\nBannerjea (Sir G.), 171\r\n\r\nBonnerjea, W.

They are so instinct with passion of a consuming\r\nemotion, so fired with the force of a national conviction, that it is\r\nimpossible to believe they can fail to impress all to whom liberty is\r\nmore than a name and country more than a mere geographical expression.\r\nOf the facts and aspirations they so vividly record, few are more\r\ncompetent to speak than their author, for Lajpat Rai has long been in\r\nthe forefront of the Indian Nationalist movement, and has suffered as\r\nwell as striven in the promotion of its cause.”\r\n\r\nTHE NEW STATESMAN (London):\r\n\r\n“This is emphatically a book to be read by the Secretary of State for\r\nIndia himself, as well as by the members of the Council and the clerks\r\nin the India Office. It ought to be pondered over by every Indian\r\ncivilian. It is not that it brings any new indictment against British\r\nrule in India, though much that Mr. Lajpat Rai says is very\r\nuncomfortable reading; but it reveals, alike to the Indian bureaucracy\r\nand to the British public, how unexpectedly acute and well-informed is\r\nthe criticism to which our somewhat slow and stupid Administration is\r\nsubjected, how completely it is out of touch with the thought of\r\neducated ‘Young India;’ how far we are from getting into sympathetic\r\naccord with the feelings and aspirations of the educated classes,\r\nMussulman as well as Hindoo.... Those who read Mr. Lajpat Rai’s very\r\nsignificant volume (Will the Indian Government even allow it to enter\r\nIndia?) will not agree with all his statements or proposals. But they\r\ndeserve to be widely read and carefully weighed. Every Briton would be\r\nthe better for reading them. And they deserve an answer--not merely a\r\nreasoned refutation by the India Office of that which it thinks\r\nerroneous or perverse, but, what is much more important, a prompt reform\r\nof all that the India Office does not venture to defend.”\r\n\r\nREEDY’S MIRROR (St. Louis):\r\n\r\n“The book is profoundly interesting as showing what the native thinks of\r\nBritish rule in India. Heretofore we have seen almost wholly through\r\nCaucasian eyes--mostly the eyes, of Englishmen, members of the\r\ngovernment bureaucracy or missionaries, who have represented England as\r\nthe great benefactor of India. Through the eyes of Mr. Rai we see an\r\nentirely different India--an India under a perfect despotism, in the\r\nmain a benevolent despotism, but which does not hesitate to use the\r\nmailed hand when opposed.”\r\n\r\nTHE NATION (London):\r\n\r\n“The whole book is a definite and we believe an accurate statement of\r\nthe present feeling among a rapidly increasing body of young and\r\neducated Indians who have learnt the value of political freedom and the\r\ndifficulty of winning or retaining it.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                _WORKS BY THE SAME AUTHOR (IN ENGLISH)_\r\n\r\nTHE ARYA SAMAJ\r\n\r\nAn account of its origin, doctrines and activities, with a Biographical\r\nSketch of the Founder.

Since then the organization which\r\nDayananda founded has increased enormously, and numbered 243,000 members\r\nin 1911, having more than doubled since 1901.\r\n\r\nThe Arya Samaj aims at a thorough reformation of the religion of\r\nHinduism. It advocates the abolition of the worship of Idols and desires\r\nthat the Hindu religion should be restored to the pure and lofty\r\nMonotheism of the Vedas which it believes to be the sole source of\r\nreligious truth. Mr. Blunt, I.C.S., in the census report for the United\r\nProvince for 1911 calls it “the greatest religious movement in India of\r\nthe past half century.”\r\n\r\n     _New York Times_:--It is quite impossible for any one possessed of\r\n     imagination to close this book without feeling that it has\r\n     introduced him to a movement of very great importance ...

On the 8th of August last the child was\r\n playing with it but could not explode the paper caps. A thirteen year\r\n lad showed him how to do it. The boy was at once arrested by a beat\r\n constable and marched off to the Wat Ganjthana with the fire arm. The\r\n boy was eventually sent up for trial at Alipur and the Court fined him\r\n three rupees.”\r\n\r\n [17] Commenting on the annual report of the issue of licenses the\r\n Indian press have made similar statements. The _Punjabee_ says “while\r\n the ruffians bent on crime have been able to secure fire arms by foul\r\n means, the law abiding section of the community have for the most part\r\n continued helpless owing to the difficulties of obtaining licenses for\r\n fire arms.” See also _Bengalee_ of the 6th Oct. 1915.\r\n\r\n [18] The italics are mine.\r\n\r\n [19] The italics are mine.\r\n\r\n [20] The examinations have not been discontinued but statutory\r\n provision has been made for a large proportion of the appointments\r\n formerly filled by examination to be now filled by nomination.\r\n\r\n [21] Mr. Lowes Dickinson, an English Professor who has largely\r\n travelled in India, has practically admitted the truth of this remark.\r\n (P. 23, An Essay on the Civilisation of India, China, and Japan.

They rose or fell with the\r\n rise and fall of the territory they lived in. Fathers there deposited\r\n the hopes of their posterity; the children there beheld the monuments\r\n of their fathers. Here their lot was finally cast; and it is the\r\n normal wish of all that their lot should not be cast in bad land.\r\n Poverty, sterility, and desolation are not a recreating prospect to\r\n the eye of man, and there are very few who can bear to grow old among\r\n the curses of a whole people. If their passion or avarice drove the\r\n Tartar hordes to acts of rapacity or tyranny, there was time enough,\r\n even in the short life of man, to bring round the ill effects of the\r\n abuse of power upon the power itself. If hoards were made by violence\r\n and tyranny, they were still domestic hoards, and domestic profusion,\r\n or the rapine of a more powerful and prodigal hand, restored them to\r\n the people. With many disorders and with few political checks upon\r\n power, nature had still fair play, the sources of acquisition were\r\n not dried up, and therefore the trade, the manufactures, and the\r\n commerce of the country flourished. Even avarice and usury itself\r\n operated both for the preservation and the employment of national\r\n wealth. The husbandman and manufacturer paid heavy interest, but then\r\n they augmented the fund from whence they were again to borrow. Their\r\n resources were dearly bought, but they were sure, and the general\r\n stock of the community grew by the general effect.\r\n\r\n “But under the English Government all this order is reversed. The\r\n Tartar invasion was mischievous, but it is our protection that\r\n destroys India. It was their enmity, but it is our friendship. Our\r\n conquest there, after twenty years, is as crude as it was the first\r\n day. The natives scarcely know what it is to see the grey head of an\r\n Englishman; young men, boys almost, govern there, without society, and\r\n without sympathy with the natives. They have no more social habits\r\n with the people than if they still resided in England; nor, indeed,\r\n any species of intercourse but that which is necessary to making a\r\n sudden fortune, with a view to a remote settlement. Animated with all\r\n the avarice of age, and all the impetuosity of youth, they roll in\r\n one after another, wave after wave, and there is nothing before the\r\n eyes of the natives but an endless, hopeless prospect of new flights\r\n of birds of prey and passage, with appetites continually renewing for\r\n a food that is continually wasting. Every rupee of profit made by an\r\n Englishman is lost forever to India.” (Edmund Burke in a speech made\r\n in the House of Commons in 1783 A. D. The reflections\r\n are as good, to-day, as they were then.)\r\n\r\n [37] The constitution of the Government of India is settled by laws\r\n made by the Parliament of Great Britain, in which India is not\r\n represented.\r\n\r\n [38] See Sir Henry Cotton’s New India (1907), pp. 68, 69 and 70.\r\n\r\n [39] In England this is the view of the bulk of the Indian student\r\n community. The Government, of course, repudiates that view.\r\n\r\n [40] In this connection we may refer the reader to an excellent\r\n article published in the _New Statesman_ (London) dated April 1, 1916,\r\n called, “If the Germans conquered England.” With the alteration of\r\n England for Germany and India for England the article would make an\r\n excellent exposition of the position of the Indian Nationalist.\r\n\r\n [41] See New India by Sir Henry Cotton, 1907, p. 34.\r\n\r\n [42] It should be noted that the evils complained of in this chapter\r\n are the evils of the system which, in the words of John Stuart Mill,\r\n is unnatural, and the unnaturalness of which is recognised in full by\r\n many fair-minded Britishers. It was recognised so far back as 1835 by\r\n the British historian Wilson in his concluding remarks in the last\r\n chapter of his monumental History of British India.\r\n\r\n [43] The Punjab.\r\n\r\n [44] Sivaji was the founder of the Mahratta Empire in India.\r\n\r\n [45] Sirhind is a small town on the road to Delhi, where the Muslim\r\n governor of the time tortured the two minor sons of Guru Govind Singh\r\n to death by placing them between two brick walls.\r\n\r\n [46] See Kaye and Malleson, vol. II, p. 367. “In respect to the\r\n mutineers of the 55th, they were taken fighting against us, and so\r\n far deserve little mercy. But, on full reflection, I would not put\r\n them all to death. I do not think that we should be justified in the\r\n eyes of the Almighty in doing so. A hundred and twenty men are a large\r\n number to put to death. Our object is to make an example to terrify\r\n others. I think this object would be effectually gained by destroying\r\n from a quarter to a third of them. I would select all of those against\r\n whom anything bad can be shown--such as general bad character,\r\n turbulence, prominence in disaffection or in the fight, disrespectful\r\n demeanor to their officers during the few days before the 26th, and\r\n the like. If these did not make up the required number, I would then\r\n add to them the oldest soldiers. All these should be shot or blown\r\n away from the guns, as may be most expedient. The rest I would divide\r\n into patches: some to be imprisoned ten years, some seven, some five,\r\n some three.”\r\n\r\n [47] History of Indian Mutiny, Kaye and Malleson, vol. II, p. 203.\r\n “Martial law had been proclaimed; those terrible Acts passed by\r\n the Legislative Council in May and June were in full operation;\r\n and soldiers and civilians alike were holding Bloody Assize, or\r\n slaying natives without any Assize at all, regardless of sex or age.\r\n Afterwards the thirst for blood grew stronger still. It is on the\r\n records of our British Parliament, in papers sent home by the Governor\r\n General of India in Council, that the aged, women, and children,\r\n are sacrificed, as well as those guilty of rebellion. They were not\r\n deliberately hanged, but burnt to death in their villages--perhaps now\r\n and then accidently shot. Englishmen did not hesitate to boast, or to\r\n record their boastings in writings, that they had ‘spared no one,’ and\r\n that ‘peppering away at niggers’ was very pleasant pastime, ‘enjoyed\r\n amazingly,’ It has been stated in a book patronised by high class\r\n authorities, that ‘for three months eight dead-carts daily went their\r\n rounds from sunrise to sunset to take down the corpses which hung at\r\n the cross-roads and market-places,’ and that ‘six thousand beings’ had\r\n been thus summarily disposed of and launched into eternity.”\r\n\r\n [48] See Kaye and Malleson’s History of the Mutiny, vol. II, p. 177.\r\n “Already our military officers were hunting down the criminals of\r\n all kinds, and hanging them up with as little compunction as though\r\n they had been pariah-dogs, or jackals, or vermin of a baser kind. One\r\n contemporary writer has recorded that, on the morning of disarming\r\n parade, the first thing he saw from the Mint was a ‘row of gallowses.’\r\n A few days afterwards the military courts or commissions were sitting\r\n daily, and sentencing old and young to be hanged with indiscriminate\r\n ferocity. On one occasion, some young boys, who, seemingly in mere\r\n sport, had flaunted rebel colours and gone about beating tom-toms,\r\n were tried and sentenced to death. One of the officers composing the\r\n court, a man unsparing before an enemy under arms, but compassionate,\r\n as all brave men are, towards the weak and the helpless, went with\r\n tears in his eyes to the commanding officer, imploring him to remit\r\n the sentence passed against these juvenile offenders, but with little\r\n effect on the side of mercy. And what was done with some show of\r\n formality either of military or of criminal law, was as nothing, I\r\n fear, weighed against what was done without any formality at all.\r\n Volunteer hanging parties went out into the districts, and amateur\r\n executioners were not wanting to the occasion. One gentleman boasted\r\n of the numbers he had finished off quite ‘in an artistic manner,’ with\r\n mango-trees for gibbets and elephants for drops, the victims of this\r\n wild justice being strung up, as though for pastime, in ‘the form of a\r\n figure of eight.’”\r\n\r\n On mock trials see Holmes’ History of the Sepoy War, p. 124.\r\n “Officers, as they went to sit on the court martial, swore that they\r\n would hang their prisoners, guilty or innocent.... Prisoners condemned\r\n to death after a hasty trial were mocked at and tortured by ignorant\r\n privates before their execution, while educated officers looked on and\r\n approved.” “Old men who had done us no harm, and helpless women with\r\n sucking infants at their breasts felt the weight of our vengeance, no\r\n less than the vilest malefactors.” Again see History of the Siege of\r\n Delhi quoted by Savarkar in his “War of Indian Independence,” p. 111,\r\n by an officer who served there, how, on the way from Umbala to Delhi,\r\n thousands were placed before a court martial in rows after rows and\r\n condemned to be hanged or shot. In some places cow’s flesh was forced\r\n by spears and bayonets into the mouths of the condemned. (All Hindus\r\n abhor cow’s flesh and would rather die than eat it.)\r\n\r\n See Charles Ball’s Indian Mutiny, vol. I, p. 257. “One trip I enjoyed\r\n amazingly; we got on board a steamer with a gun, while the Sikhs and\r\n the fusiliers marched up to the city. We steamed up throwing shots\r\n right and left till we got up to the bad places, when we went on the\r\n shore and peppered away with our guns, my old double-barrel bringing\r\n down several niggers. So thirsty for vengeance I was. We fired the\r\n places right and left and the flames shot up to the heavens as they\r\n spread, fanned by the breeze, showing that the day of vengeance had\r\n fallen on the treacherous villains. Every day we had expeditions to\r\n burn and destroy disaffected villages and we had taken our revenge.\r\n I have been appointed the chief of a commission for the trial of all\r\n natives charged with offences against the Government and persons. Day\r\n by day, we have strung up eight or ten men. We have the power of life\r\n in our hands and, I assure you, we spare not. A very summary trial is\r\n all that takes place. The condemned culprit is placed under a tree,\r\n with a rope around his neck, on the top of a carriage, and when it is\r\n pulled off he swings.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n “In the Punjab, near Ajnala, in a small island, many a Sepoy who\r\n had simply fled away from a regiment which was working under the\r\n reasonable fear of being disarmed and shot by the Government for\r\n suspicion, was hiding himself. Cooper with a loyal body of troops\r\n took them prisoner. The entire number, amounting to two hundred\r\n and eighty-two, were then conveyed by Cooper to Ajnala. Then came\r\n the question what was to be done with them. There was no means of\r\n transporting them to a place where they could be tried formally. On\r\n the other hand, if they were summarily executed, other regiments\r\n and intending rebels might take warning by their fate, and thus,\r\n further bloodshed might be prevented. For these reasons, Cooper,\r\n fully conscious as he was of the enormous responsibility which he\r\n was undertaking, resolved to put them all to death. Next morning,\r\n accordingly, he brought them out in tens and made some Sikhs shoot\r\n them. In this way, two hundred and sixteen perished. But, there still\r\n remained sixty-six others who had been confined in one of the bastions\r\n of the Tahsil. Expecting resistance, Cooper ordered the door to be\r\n opened. But not a sound issued from the room; forty-five of them were\r\n dead bodies lying on the floor. For, unknown to Cooper, the windows\r\n had been closely shut and the wretched prisoners had found in the\r\n bastion a second Black-Hole. The remaining twenty-one were shot, like\r\n their comrades. 1--8--’57. For this splendid assumption of authority,\r\n Cooper was assailed by the hysterical cries of ignorant humanitarians.\r\n But Robert Montgomery unanswerably vindicated his character by proving\r\n that he had saved the Lahore division.”--Holmes’s History of the\r\n Indian Mutiny, p. 363.\r\n\r\n “It is related that, in the absence of tangible enemies, some of our\r\n soldiery, who turned out on this occasion, butchered a number of\r\n unoffending camp-followers, servants, and others who were huddling\r\n together in vague alarm, near the Christian church-yard. No loyalty,\r\n no fidelity, no patient good service on the part of these good people\r\n could extinguish, for a moment, the fierce hatred which possessed\r\n our white soldiers against all who wore the dusky livery of the\r\n East.”--Kaye and Malleson’s Indian Mutiny, vol. II, p. 438.\r\n\r\n [49] It should be noted that this visit took place during the present\r\n war and the observations recorded above were penned after the “unique”\r\n outburst of loyalty on the part of the Indians in connection with the\r\n Great War.\r\n\r\n [50] A native term equivalent for Europeans.\r\n\r\n [51] This is a native expression signifying the highest respect of the\r\n speaker towards one whom he considers his superior. Literally it means\r\n mother and father.\r\n\r\n [52] _I. e._, like the English.\r\n\r\n [53] In the interests of Lancashire goods.\r\n\r\n [54] Mr. Ilbert was the Law member of the Council of the Governor\r\n General and the bill came to be named after him.\r\n\r\n [55] Mr. Hume was an ex-secretary-of the Government of India who had\r\n retired from service.\r\n\r\n [56] Sir William Wedderburn is also a retired member of the Government\r\n of Bombay, India.\r\n\r\n [57] Sir Auckland Colvin was the Lieutenant Governor of the then North\r\n Western Provinces (now the United Province of Agra and Oudh).\r\n\r\n [58] The quotations from Hume are taken out of W. Wedderburn’s Allan\r\n Octavian Hume, the parts enclosed in parenthesis are Wedderburn’s.\r\n\r\n [59] These compliments have been renewed of late. The Congress held at\r\n Madras in 1914 was attended by the British Governor of the Presidency.\r\n\r\n [60] Mr. Hume’s biography by Sir William Wedderburn, p. 62.\r\n\r\n [61] Mr. Hume’s biography by Sir W. W., p. 63.\r\n\r\n [62] Biography, p. 63.\r\n\r\n [63] Swadeshi means country-made, and Swaraj means self-government or\r\n self-rule.\r\n\r\n [64] The Congress session held at Surat in December, 1907, ended in a\r\n split preceded by a disorderly meeting.\r\n\r\n [65] Presided over by the Honourable Mr. G. K. Gokhale, a member of\r\n the Viceroy’s Council.\r\n\r\n [66] Swadeshi means the cult of home industries, _i.e._, the use of\r\n the articles made in the country.\r\n\r\n [67] An eminent Bengalee writer.\r\n\r\n [68] Moreover the keynote of these organisations was association and\r\n co-operation with Government, and not independent self-assertion.\r\n\r\n [69] These are signs of mourning in India.\r\n\r\n [70] An eminent nobleman and landlord of Bengal.\r\n\r\n [71] India made goods.\r\n\r\n [72] Wholesale piece goods merchants belonging to Upper India are\r\n known in Calcutta by that name.\r\n\r\n [73] A ruling chief in the Bombay Presidency.\r\n\r\n [74] In my opinion there has never been any time in human history when\r\n religion and morals were successfully divorced from politics, either\r\n in Ancient India or anywhere else.\r\n\r\n [75] Societies, Associations and Gymnasiums.\r\n\r\n [76] A leader universally respected and loved by all classes of people\r\n throughout India. See frontispiece.\r\n\r\n [77] See Mr. H. W. Nevinson’s New Spirit in India, p. 295; also pp.\r\n 133, 233, etc.; see also Mr. J. Ramsay Macdonald’s Awakening of India.\r\n\r\n [78] For an account of this split see H. W. Nevinson’s New Spirit in\r\n India, Chap. XIII.\r\n\r\n [79] A reward of one hundred thousand Rupees equal to 33,000 dollars\r\n was offered for information leading to the arrest of the culprit or\r\n culprits.\r\n\r\n [80] Name of a religious sect. See Pratts’ India and Its Faiths, p. 13.\r\n\r\n [81] The Spirit of Indian Nationalism, by Mr. B. C. Pal. p. 36.\r\n\r\n [82] A great Bengalee writer of fiction who composed the well-known\r\n nationalist song, “Bande Mataram” or Hail Motherland.\r\n\r\n [83] Or the foreign exploiters.\r\n\r\n [84] It was in the first half of the year 1908 that the first bomb\r\n was thrown at Muzaffarpur, Behar. It was meant for a Magistrate who\r\n had been passing sentences of whipping on nationalist youths, but by\r\n mistake it struck a quite innocent person. The investigation of this\r\n case resulted in the discovery of a big conspiracy. The trial of this\r\n conspiracy is known by the name “Maniktolah Bomb Case” from the fact\r\n that the headquarters of this conspiracy were alleged to have been in\r\n the Maniktolah gardens, Calcutta. One of the conspirators Narendra\r\n Nath Gossain became an approver. After the case had been committed\r\n for trial before the Sessions Court and when the approver and the\r\n accused were both lodged in jail at Alipore, one of the leaders of the\r\n conspiracy shot the approver dead with a rifle which had been smuggled\r\n into the jail premises by their friends.\r\n\r\n [85] A great Nationalist leader of Bengal, now dead.\r\n\r\n [86] One of his followers in San Francisco has told me that this\r\n description of him, viz., that he does not advocate the use of the\r\n bomb or the revolver is not correct.\r\n\r\n [87] This is illustrated in Indian official life day in and day out.\r\n It is not a rare occurrence that the British heads of the Departments\r\n get credit for what has been achieved by the genius, intelligence and\r\n labour of their Indian subordinates.\r\n\r\n [88] Indian heroes.\r\n\r\n [89] Non-commissioned officers of the native Indian army.\r\n\r\n [90] Force, energy and vitality.\r\n\r\n [91] Life of meditation and self-denial.\r\n\r\n [92] Lord Dufferin was the Governor General of India and Sir A.\r\n Colvin was the Lieutenant Governor of what were then the Northwestern\r\n Provinces, now the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh.\r\n\r\n [93] The organisation of the Pro-British Muslims.\r\n\r\n [94] See the Introduction.\r\n\r\n [95] Komagata Maru is the name of a Japanese steamer, which a number\r\n of Sikh emigrants chartered in Hong Kong in 1914 a. d. in order to\r\n take them to Canada. They were not allowed to land and were forced\r\n to return to India, under circumstances which have created a bitter\r\n anti-British feeling among the Indians all over the world.\r\n\r\n [96] During her most dreadful famines hundreds of thousands of tons of\r\n foodstuffs were shipped out of India.\r\n\r\n [97] See Mill’s History of British India, Vol. VI, pp. 149, 150, Vol.\r\n VII, p. 388, and p. 393, Vol. IX, pp. 207, 209. See Bishop Heber’s\r\n description of India in 1824 quoted in Mill and Wilson’s History of\r\n India, Vol. IX, p. 376. Also that of Mr. Shore in 1833.\r\n\r\n [98] We do not mean to say that British Rule in India is responsible\r\n for the plague, but with better management of resources, i.e., better\r\n sanitation, the plague could have been prevented or eradicated sooner\r\n than has been attempted.",
