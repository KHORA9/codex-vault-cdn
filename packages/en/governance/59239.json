She had a reason for\r\nlooking instinctively out at the sea-line; a reason that many young\r\nwomen have had in the history of the world. But there was no sail in\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nOn the beach below the parade were a succession of small crowds,\r\nsurrounding the usual orators of the seaside; whether niggers or\r\nsocialists, whether clowns or clergymen. Here would stand a man doing\r\nsomething or other with paper boxes; and the holiday makers would watch\r\nhim for hours in the hope of some time knowing what it was that he was\r\ndoing with them. Next to him would be a man in a top hat with a very big\r\nBible and a very small wife, who stood silently beside him, while he\r\nfought with his clenched fist against the heresy of Milnian\r\nSublapsarianism so wide-spread in fashionable watering-places. It was\r\nnot easy to follow him, he was so very much excited; but every now and\r\nthen the words “our Sublapsarian friends” would recur with a kind of\r\nwailing sneer. Next was a young man talking of nobody knew what (least\r\nof all himself), but apparently relying for public favour mainly on\r\nhaving a ring of carrots round his hat. He had more money lying in front\r\nof him than the others. Next were niggers. Next was a children’s service\r\nconducted by a man with a long neck who beat time with a little wooden\r\nspade. Farther along there was an atheist, in a towering rage, who\r\npointed every now and then at the children’s service and spoke of\r\nNature’s fairest things being corrupted with the secrets of the Spanish\r\nInquisition—by the man with the little spade, of course. The atheist\r\n(who wore a red rosette) was very withering to his own audience as well.\r\n“Hypocrites!” he would say; and then they would throw him money. “Dupes\r\nand dastards!” and then they would throw him more money. But between the\r\natheist and the children’s service was a little owlish man in a red fez,\r\nweakly waving a green gamp umbrella. His face was brown and wrinkled\r\nlike a walnut, his nose was of the sort we associate with Judæa, his\r\nbeard was the sort of black wedge we associate rather with Persia. The\r\nyoung woman had never seen him before; he was a new exhibit in the now\r\nfamiliar museum of cranks and quacks. The young woman was one of those\r\npeople in whom a real sense of humour is always at issue with a certain\r\ntemperamental tendency to boredom or melancholia; and she lingered a\r\nmoment, and leaned on the rail to listen.\r\n\r\nIt was fully four minutes before she could understand a word the man was\r\nsaying; he spoke English with so extraordinary an accent that she\r\nsupposed at first that he was talking in his own oriental tongue. All\r\nthe noises of that articulation were odd; the most marked was an extreme\r\nprolongation of the short “u” into “oo”; as in “poo-oot” for “put.”\r\nGradually the girl got used to the dialect, and began to understand the\r\nwords; though some time elapsed even then before she could form any\r\nconjecture of their subject matter. Eventually it appeared to her that\r\nhe had some fad about English civilisation having been founded by the\r\nTurks; or, perhaps by the Saracens after their victory in the Crusades.\r\nHe also seemed to think that Englishmen would soon return to this way of\r\nthinking; and seemed to be urging the spread of teetotalism as an\r\nevidence of it. The girl was the only person listening to him.\r\n\r\n“Loo-ook,” he said, wagging a curled brown finger, “loo-ook at your own\r\ninns” (which he pronounced as “ince”). “Your inns of which you write in\r\nyour boo-ooks! Those inns were not poo-oot up in the beginning to sell\r\nze alcoholic Christian drink. They were put up to sell ze non-alcoholic\r\nIslamic drinks. You can see this in the names of your inns. They are\r\neastern names, Asiatic names. You have a famous public house to which\r\nyour omnibuses go on the pilgrimage. It is called the Elephant and\r\nCastle. That is not an English name. It is an Asiatic name. You will say\r\nthere are castles in England, and I will agree with you. There is the\r\nWindsor Castle. But where,” he cried sternly, shaking his green umbrella\r\nat the girl in an angry oratorical triumph, “where is the Windsor\r\nElephant? I have searched all Windsor Park. No elephants.”\r\n\r\nThe girl with the dark hair smiled, and began to think that this man was\r\nbetter than any of the others. In accordance with the strange system of\r\nconcurrent religious endowment which prevails at watering-places, she\r\ndropped a two shilling piece into the round copper tray beside him. With\r\nhonourable and disinterested eagerness, the old gentleman in the red fez\r\ntook no notice of this, but went on warmly, if obscurely, with his\r\nargument.\r\n\r\n“Then you have a place of drink in this town which you call The Bool!”\r\n\r\n“We generally call it The Bull,” said the interested young lady, with a\r\nvery melodious voice.\r\n\r\n“You have a place of drink, which you call The Bool,” he reiterated in a\r\nsort of abstract fury, “and surely you see that this is all vary\r\nridiculous!”\r\n\r\n“No, no!” said the girl, softly, and in deprecation.\r\n\r\n“Why should there be a Bull?” he cried, prolonging the word in his own\r\nway. “Why should there be a Bull in connection with a festive locality?\r\nWho thinks about a Bull in gardens of delight? What need is there of a\r\nBull when we watch the tulip-tinted maidens dance or pour the sparkling\r\nsherbert? You yourselves, my friends?” And he looked around radiantly,\r\nas if addressing an enormous mob. “You yourselves have a proverb, ‘It is\r\nnot calculated to promote prosperity to have a Bull in a china shop.’\r\nEqually, my friends, it would not be calculated to promote prosperity to\r\nhave a Bull in a wine shop. All this is clear.”\r\n\r\nHe stuck his umbrella upright in the sand and struck one finger against\r\nanother, like a man getting to business at last.\r\n\r\n“It iss as clear as the sun at noon,” he said solemnly. “It iss as clear\r\nas the sun at noon that this word Bull, which is devoid of restful and\r\npleasurable associations, is but the corruption of another word, which\r\npossesses restful and pleasurable associations. The word is not Bull; it\r\nis the Bul-Bul!” His voice rose suddenly like a trumpet and he spread\r\nabroad his hands like the fans of a tropic palm-tree.\r\n\r\nAfter this great effect he was a little more subdued and leaned gravely\r\non his umbrella. “You will find the same trace of Asiatic nomenclature\r\nin the names of all your English inns,” he went on. “Nay, you will find\r\nit, I am almost certain, in all your terms in any way connected with\r\nyour revelries and your reposes. Why, my good friends, the very name of\r\nthat insidious spirit by which you make strong your drinks is an Arabic\r\nword: alcohol. It is obvious, is it not, that this is the Arabic article\r\n‘Al,’ as in Alhambra, as in Algebra; and we need not pause here to\r\npursue its many appearances in connection with your festive\r\ninstitutions, as in your Alsop’s beer, your Ally Sloper, and your partly\r\njoyous institution of the Albert Memorial. Above all, in your greatest\r\nfeasting day—your Christmas day—which you so erroneously suppose to be\r\nconnected with your religion, what do you say then? Do you say the names\r\nof the Christian Nations? Do you say, ‘I will have a little France. I\r\nwill have a little Ireland. I will have a little Scotland. I will have a\r\nlittle Spain?’ No—o.” And the noise of the negative seemed to waggle as\r\ndoes the bleating of a sheep. “You say, ‘I will have a little Turkey,’\r\nwhich is your name for the Country of the Servant of the Prophet!”\r\n\r\nAnd once more he stretched out his arms sublimely to the east and west\r\nand appealed to earth and heaven. The young lady, looking at the\r\nsea-green horizon with a smile, clapped her grey gloved hands softly\r\ntogether as if at a peroration. But the little old man with the fez was\r\nfar from exhausted yet.\r\n\r\n“In reply to this you will object—” he began.\r\n\r\n“O no, no,” breathed the young lady in a sort of dreamy rapture. “I\r\ndon’t object. I don’t object the littlest bit!”\r\n\r\n“In reply to this you will object—” proceeded her preceptor, “that some\r\ninns are actually named after the symbols of your national\r\nsuperstitions. You will hasten to point out to me that the Golden Cross\r\nis situated opposite Charing Cross, and you will expatiate at length on\r\nKing’s Cross, Gerrard’s Cross and the many crosses that are to be found\r\nin or near London. But you must not forget,” and here he wagged his\r\ngreen umbrella roguishly at the girl, as if he was going to poke her\r\nwith it, “none of you, my friends, must forget what a large number of\r\nCrescents there are in London! Denmark Crescent; Mornington Crescent!\r\nSt. Mark’s Crescent! St. George’s Crescent! Grosvenor Crescent! Regent’s\r\nPark Crescent! Nay, Royal Crescent! And why should we forget Pelham\r\nCrescent? Why, indeed? Everywhere, I say, homage paid to the holy symbol\r\nof the religion of the Prophet! Compare with this network and pattern of\r\ncrescents, this city almost consisting of crescents, the meagre array of\r\ncrosses, which remain to attest the ephemeral superstition to which you\r\nwere, for one weak moment, inclined.”\r\n\r\nThe crowds on the beach were rapidly thinning as tea-time drew nearer.\r\nThe west grew clearer and clearer with the evening, till the sunshine\r\nseemed to have got behind the pale green sea and be shining through, as\r\nthrough a wall of thin green glass. The very transparency of sky and sea\r\nmight have to this girl, for whom the sea was the romance and the\r\ntragedy, the hint of a sort of radiant hopelessness. The flood made of a\r\nmillion emeralds was ebbing as slowly as the sun was sinking: but the\r\nriver of human nonsense flowed on for ever.\r\n\r\n“I will not for one moment maintain,” said the old gentleman, “that\r\nthere are no difficulties in my case; or that all the examples are as\r\nobviously true as those that I have just demonstrated. No-o. It is\r\nobvious, let us say, that the ‘Saracen’s Head’ is a corruption of the\r\nhistoric truth ‘The Saracen is Ahead’—I am far from saying it is equally\r\nobvious that the ‘Green Dragon’ was originally ‘the Agreeing Dragoman’;\r\nthough I hope to prove in my book that it is so. I will only say here\r\nthat it is su-urely more probable that one poo-ooting himself forward to\r\nattract the wayfarer in the desert, would compare himself to a friendly\r\nand persuadable guide or courier, rather than to a voracious monster.\r\nSometimes the true origin is very hard to trace; as in the inn that\r\ncommemorates our great Moslem Warrior, Amir Ali Ben Bhoze, whom you have\r\nso quaintly abbreviated into Admiral Benbow. Sometimes it is even more\r\ndifficult for the seeker after truth. There is a place of drink near to\r\nhere called ‘The Old Ship’—”\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the girl remained on the ring of the horizon as rigid as the\r\nring itself; but her whole face had coloured and altered. The sands were\r\nalmost emptied by now: the atheist was as non-existent as his God; and\r\nthose who had hoped to know what was being done to the paper boxes had\r\ngone away to their tea without knowing it. But the young woman still\r\nleaned on the railing. Her face was suddenly alive; and it looked as if\r\nher body could not move.\r\n\r\n“It shood be admitted—” bleated the old man with the green umbrella,\r\n“that there is no literally self-evident trace of the Asiatic\r\nnomenclature in the words ‘the old ship.’ But even here the see-eeker\r\nafter Truth can poot himself in touch with facts. I questioned the\r\nproprietor of ‘The Old Ship’ who is, according to such notes as I have\r\nkept, a Mr. Pumph.”\r\n\r\nThe girl’s lip trembled.\r\n\r\n“Poor old Hump!” she said. “Why, I’d forgotten about him. He must be\r\nvery nearly as worried as I am! I hope this man won’t be too silly about\r\nthis! I’d rather it weren’t about this!”\r\n\r\n“And Mr. Pumph to-old me the inn was named by a vary intimate friend of\r\nhis, an Irishman who had been a Captain in the Britannic Royal Navy, but\r\nhad resigned his po-ost in anger at the treatment of Ireland. Though\r\nquitting the service, he retained joost enough of the superstition of\r\nyour western sailors, to wish his friend’s inn to be named after his old\r\nship. But as the name of the ship was ‘The United Kingdom—’”\r\n\r\nHis female pupil, if she could not exactly be said to be sitting at his\r\nfeet, was undoubtedly leaning out very eagerly above his head. Amid the\r\nsolitude of the sands she called out in a loud and clear voice, “Can you\r\ntell me the Captain’s name?”\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman jumped, blinked and stared like a startled owl. Having\r\nbeen talking for hours as if he had an audience of thousands, he seemed\r\nsuddenly very much embarrassed to find that he had even an audience of\r\none. By this time they seemed to be almost the only human creatures\r\nalong the shore; almost the only living creatures, except the seagulls.\r\nThe sun, in dropping finally, seemed to have broken as a blood orange\r\nmight break; and lines of blood-red light were spilt along the split,\r\nlow, level skies. This abrupt and belated brilliance took all the colour\r\nout of the man’s red cap and green umbrella; but his dark figure,\r\ndistinct against the sea and the sunset, remained the same, save that it\r\nwas more agitated than before.\r\n\r\n“The name,” he said, “the Captain’s name. I—I understood it was Dalroy.\r\nBut what I wish to indicate, what I wish to expound, is that here again\r\nthe seeker after truth can find the connection of his ideas. It was\r\nexplained to me by Mr. Pumph that he was rearranging the place of\r\nfestivity, in no inconsiderable proportion because of the anticipated\r\nreturn of the Captain in question, who had, as it appeared, taken\r\nservice in some not very large Navy, but had left it and was coming\r\nhome. Now, mark all of you, my friends,” he said to the seagulls “that\r\neven here the chain of logic holds.”\r\n\r\nHe said it to the seagulls because the young lady, after staring at him\r\nwith starry eyes for a moment and leaning heavily on the railing, had\r\nturned her back and disappeared rapidly into the twilight. After her\r\nhasty steps had fallen silent there was no other noise than the faint\r\nbut powerful purring of the now distant sea, the occasional shriek of a\r\nsea-bird, and the continuous sound of a soliloquy.\r\n\r\n“Mark, all of you,” continued the man flourishing his green umbrella so\r\nfuriously that it almost flew open like a green flag unfurled, and then\r\nstriking it deep in the sand, in the sand in which his fighting fathers\r\nhad so often struck their tents, “mark all of you this marvellous fact!\r\nThat when, being for a time, for a time, astonished—embarrassed—brought\r\nup as you would say short—by the absence of any absolute evidence of\r\nEastern influence in the phrase ‘the old ship,’ I inquired from what\r\ncountry the Captain was returning, Mr. Pumph said to me in solemnity,\r\n‘From Turkey.’ From Turkey! From the nearest country of the Religion! I\r\nknow men say it is not our country; that no man knows where we come\r\nfrom, of what is our country. What does it matter where we come from if\r\nwe carry a message from Paradise? With a great galloping of horses we\r\ncarry it, and have no time to stop in places. But what we bring is the\r\nonly creed that has regarded what you will call in your great words the\r\nvirginity of a man’s reason, that has put no man higher than a prophet,\r\nand has respected the solitude of God.”\r\n\r\nAnd again he spread his arms out, as if addressing a mass meeting of\r\nmillions, all alone on the dark seashore.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                        THE END OF OLIVE ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE great sea-dragon of the changing colours that wriggles round the\r\nworld like a chameleon, was pale green as it washed on Pebblewick, but\r\nstrong blue where it broke on the Ionian Isles. One of the innumerable\r\nislets, hardly more than a flat white rock in the azure expanse, was\r\ncelebrated as the Isle of Olives; not because it was rich in such\r\nvegetation, but because, by some freak of soil or climate, two or three\r\nlittle olives grew there to an unparalleled height. Even in the full\r\nheat of the South it is very unusual for an olive tree to grow any\r\ntaller than a small pear tree; but the three olives that stood up as\r\nsignals on this sterile place might well be mistaken, except for the\r\nshape, for moderate sized pines or larches of the north. It was also\r\nconnected with some ancient Greek legend about Pallas the patroness of\r\nthe olive; for all that sea was alive with the first fairyland of\r\nHellas; and from the platform of marble under the olive trees could be\r\nseen the grey outline of Ithaca.\r\n\r\nOn the island and under the trees was a table set in the open air and\r\ncovered with papers and inkstands. At the table were sitting four men,\r\ntwo in uniform and two in plain black clothes. Aides-de-camps, equerries\r\nand such persons stood in a group in the background; and behind them a\r\nstring of two or three silent battle-ships lay along the sea. For peace\r\nwas being given to Europe.\r\n\r\nThere had just come to an end the long agony of one of the many\r\nunsuccessful efforts to break the strength of Turkey and save the small\r\nChristian tribes. There had been many other such meetings in the later\r\nphases of the matter as, one after another, the smaller nations gave up\r\nthe struggle, or the greater nations came in to coerce them. But the\r\ninterested parties had now dwindled to these four. For the Powers of\r\nEurope being entirely agreed on the necessity for peace on a Turkish\r\nbasis, were content to leave the last negotiations to England and\r\nGermany, who could be trusted to enforce it; there was a representative\r\nof the Sultan, of course; and there was a representative of the only\r\nenemy of the Sultan who had not hitherto come to terms.\r\n\r\nFor one tiny power had alone carried on the war month after month, and\r\nwith a tenacity and temporary success that was a new nine-days marvel\r\nevery morning. An obscure and scarcely recognized prince calling himself\r\nthe King of Ithaca had filled the Eastern Mediterranean with exploits\r\nthat were not unworthy of the audacious parallel that the name of his\r\nisland suggested. Poets could not help asking if it were Odysseus come\r\nagain; patriotic Greeks, even if they themselves had been forced to lay\r\ndown their arms, could not help feeling curious as to what Greek race or\r\nname was boasted by the new and heroic royal house. It was, therefore,\r\nwith some amusement that the world at last discovered that the\r\ndescendant of Ulysses was a cheeky Irish adventurer named Patrick\r\nDalroy; who had once been in the English Navy, had got into a quarrel\r\nthrough his Fenian sympathies and resigned his commission. Since then he\r\nhad seen many adventures in many uniforms; and always got himself or\r\nsome one else into hot water with an extraordinary mixture of cynicism\r\nand quixotry. In his fantastic little kingdom, of course, he had been\r\nhis own General, his own Admiral, his own Foreign Secretary and his own\r\nAmbassador; but he was always careful to follow the wishes of his people\r\nin the essentials of peace and war; and it was at their direction that\r\nhe had come to lay down his sword at last. Besides his professional\r\nskill, he was chiefly famous for his enormous bodily strength and\r\nstature. It is the custom in newspapers nowadays to say that mere\r\nbarbaric muscular power is valueless in modern military actions, but\r\nthis view may be as much exaggerated as its opposite. In such wars as\r\nthese of the Near East, where whole populations are slightly armed and\r\npersonal assault is common, a leader who can defend his head often has a\r\nreal advantage; and it is not true, even in a general way, that strength\r\nis of no use. This was admitted by Lord Ivywood, the English Minister,\r\nwho was pointing out in detail to King Patrick the hopeless superiority\r\nof the light pattern of Turkish field gun; and the King of Ithaca,\r\nremarking that he was quite convinced, said he would take it with him,\r\nand ran away with it under his arm. It would be conceded by the greatest\r\nof the Turkish warriors, the terrifying Oman Pasha, equally famous for\r\nhis courage in war and his cruelty in peace; but who carried on his brow\r\na scar from Patrick’s sword, taken after three hours’ mortal combat—and\r\ntaken without spite or shame, be it said, for the Turk is always at his\r\nbest in that game. Nor would the quality be doubted by Mr. Hart, a\r\nfinancial friend of the German Minister, whom Patrick Dalroy, after\r\nasking him which of his front windows he would prefer to be thrown into,\r\nthrew into his bedroom window on the first floor with so considerate an\r\nexactitude that he alighted on the bed, where he was in a position to\r\nreceive any medical attention. But, when all is said, one muscular Irish\r\ngentleman on an island cannot fight all Europe for ever, and he came,\r\nwith a kind of gloomy good humour, to offer the terms now dictated to\r\nhim by his adopted country. He could not even knock all the diplomatists\r\ndown (for which he possessed both the power and the inclination), for he\r\nrealised, with the juster part of his mind, that they were only obeying\r\norders, as he was. So he sat heavily and sleepily at the little table,\r\nin the green and white uniform of the Navy of Ithaca (invented by\r\nhimself); a big bull of a man, monstrously young for his size, with a\r\nbull neck and two blue bull’s eyes for eyes, and red hair rising so\r\nsteadily off his scalp that it looked as if his head had caught fire: as\r\nsome said it had.\r\n\r\nThe most dominant person present was the great Oman Pasha himself, with\r\nhis strong face starved by the asceticism of war, his hair and mustache\r\nseeming rather blasted with lightning than blanched with age; a red fez\r\non his head, and between the red fez and mustache, a scar at which the\r\nKing of Ithaca did not look. His eyes had an awful lack of expression.\r\n\r\nLord Ivywood, the English Minister, was probably the handsomest man in\r\nEngland, save that he was almost colourless both in hair and complexion.\r\nAgainst that blue marble sea he might almost have been one of its old\r\nmarble statues that are faultless in line but show nothing but shades of\r\ngrey or white. It seemed a mere matter of the luck of lighting whether\r\nhis hair looked dull silver or pale brown; and his splendid mask never\r\nchanged in colour or expression. He was one of the last of the old\r\nParliamentary orators; and yet he was probably a comparatively young\r\nman; he could make anything he had to mention blossom into verbal\r\nbeauty; yet his face remained dead while his lips were alive. He had\r\nlittle old-fashioned ways, as out of old Parliaments; for instance, he\r\nwould always stand up, as in a senate, to speak to those three other\r\nmen, alone on a rock in the ocean.\r\n\r\nIn all this he perhaps appeared more personal in contrast to the man\r\nsitting next to him, who never spoke at all but whose face seemed to\r\nspeak for him. He was Dr. Gluck, the German Minister, whose face had\r\nnothing German about it; neither the German vision nor the German sleep.\r\nHis face was as vivid as a highly coloured photograph and altered like a\r\ncinema: but his scarlet lips never moved in speech. His almond eyes\r\nseemed to shine with all the shifting fires of the opal; his small,\r\ncurled black mustache seemed sometimes almost to hoist itself afresh,\r\nlike a live, black snake; but there came from him no sound. He put a\r\npaper in front of Lord Ivywood. Lord Ivywood took a pair of eyeglasses\r\nto read it, and looked ten years older by the act.\r\n\r\nIt was merely a statement of agenda; of the few last things to be\r\nsettled at this last conference. The first item ran:\r\n\r\n“The Ithacan Ambassador asks that the girls taken to harems after the\r\ncapture of Pylos be restored to their families. This cannot be granted.”\r\nLord Ivywood rose. The mere beauty of his voice startled everyone who\r\nhad not heard it before.\r\n\r\n“Your Excellencies and gentlemen,” he said, “a statement to whose policy\r\nI by no means assent, but to whose historic status I could not\r\nconceivably aspire, has familiarised you with a phrase about peace with\r\nhonour. But when we have to celebrate a peace between such historic\r\nsoldiers as Oman Pasha and His Majesty the King of Ithaca, I think we\r\nmay say that it is peace with glory.”\r\n\r\nHe paused for half an instant; yet even the silence of sea and rock\r\nseemed full of multitudinous applause, so perfectly had the words been\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\n“I think there is but one thought among us, whatever our many just\r\nobjections through these long and harassing months of negotiations—I\r\nthink there is but one thought now. That the peace may be as full as the\r\nwar—that the peace may be as fearless as the war.”\r\n\r\nOnce more he paused an instant; and felt a phantom clapping, as it were,\r\nnot from the hands but the heads of the men. He went on.\r\n\r\n“If we are to leave off fighting, we may surely leave off haggling. A\r\nstatute of limitations or, if you will, an amnesty, is surely proper\r\nwhen so sublime a peace seals so sublime a struggle. And if there be\r\nanything in which an old diplomatist may advise you, I would most\r\nstrongly say this: that there should be no new disturbance of whatever\r\namicable or domestic ties have been formed during this disturbed time. I\r\nwill admit I am sufficiently old-fashioned to think any interference\r\nwith the interior life of the family a precedent of no little peril. Nor\r\nwill I be so illiberal as not to extend to the ancient customs of Islam\r\nwhat I would extend to the ancient customs of Christianity. A suggestion\r\nhas been brought before us that we should enter into a renewed war of\r\nrecrimination as to whether certain women have left their homes with or\r\nwithout their own consent. I can conceive no controversy more perilous\r\nto begin or more impossible to conclude. I will venture to say that I\r\nexpress all your thoughts, when I say that, whatever wrongs may have\r\nbeen wrought on either side, the homes, the marriages, the family\r\narrangements of this great Ottoman Empire, shall remain as they are\r\ntoday.”\r\n\r\nNo one moved except Patrick Dalroy, who put his hand on his sword-hilt\r\nfor a moment and looked at them all with bursting eyes; then his hand\r\nfell and he laughed out loud and sudden.\r\n\r\nLord Ivywood took no notice, but picked up the agenda paper again, and\r\nagain fitted on the glasses that made him look older. He read the second\r\nitem—needless to say, not aloud. The German Minister with the far from\r\nGerman face, had written this note for him:\r\n\r\n“Both Coote and the Bernsteins insist there must be Chinese for the\r\nmarble. Greeks cannot be trusted in the quarries just now.”\r\n\r\n“But while,” continued Lord Ivywood, “we desire these fundamental\r\ninstitutions, such as the Moslem family, to remain as they are even at\r\nthis moment, we do not assent to social stagnation. Nor do we say for\r\none moment that the great tradition of Islam is capable alone of\r\nsustaining the necessities of the Near East. But I would seriously ask\r\nyour Excellencies, why should we be so vain as to suppose that the only\r\ncure for the Near East is of necessity the Near West? If new ideas are\r\nneeded, if new blood is needed, would it not be more natural to appeal\r\nto those most living, those most laborious civilisations which form the\r\nvast reserve of the Orient? Asia in Europe, if my friend Oman Pasha will\r\nallow me the criticism, has hitherto been Asia in arms. May we not yet\r\nsee Asia in Europe and yet Asia in peace? These at least are the reasons\r\nwhich lead me to consent to a scheme of colonisation.”\r\n\r\nPatrick Dalroy sprang erect, pulling himself out of his seat by\r\nclutching at an olive-branch above his head. He steadied himself by\r\nputting one hand on the trunk of the tree, and simply stared at them\r\nall. There fell on him the huge helplessness of mere physical power. He\r\ncould throw them into the sea; but what good would that do? More men on\r\nthe wrong side would be accredited to the diplomatic campaign; and the\r\nonly man on the right side would be discredited for anything. He shook\r\nthe branching olive tree above him in his fury. But he did not for one\r\nmoment disturb Lord Ivywood, who had just read the third item on his\r\nprivate agenda (“Oman Pasha insists on the destruction of the\r\nvineyards”) and was by this time engaged in a peroration which\r\nafterwards became famous and may be found in many rhetorical text books\r\nand primers. He was well into the middle of it before Dalroy’s rage and\r\nwonder allowed him to follow the words.\r\n\r\n“... do we indeed owe nothing,” the diplomatist was saying “to that\r\ngesture of high refusal in which so many centuries ago the great Arabian\r\nmystic put the wine-cup from his lips? Do we owe nothing to the long\r\nvigil of a valiant race, the long fast by which they have testified\r\nagainst the venomous beauty of the Vine? Ours is an age when men come\r\nmore and more to see that the creeds hold treasures for each other, that\r\neach religion has a secret for its neighbour, that faith unto faith\r\nuttereth speech, and church unto church showeth knowledge. If it be\r\ntrue, and I claim again the indulgence of Oman Pasha when I say I think\r\nit is true, that we of the West have brought some light to Islam in the\r\nmatter of the preciousness of peace and of civil order, may we not say\r\nthat Islam in answer shall give us peace in a thousand homes, and\r\nencourage us to cut down that curse that has done so much to thwart and\r\nmadden the virtues of Western Christendom. Already in my own country the\r\norgies that made horrible the nights of the noblest families are no\r\nmore. Already the legislature takes more and more sweeping action to\r\ndeliver the populace from the bondage of the all-destroying drug. Surely\r\nthe prophet of Mecca is reaping his harvest; the cession of the disputed\r\nvineyards to the greatest of his champions is of all acts the most\r\nappropriate to this day; to this happy day that may yet deliver the East\r\nfrom the curse of war and the West from the curse of wine. The gallant\r\nprince who meets us here at last, to offer an olive branch even more\r\nglorious than his sword, may well have our sympathy if he himself views\r\nthe cession with some sentimental regret; but I have little doubt that\r\nhe also will live to rejoice in it at last. And I would remind you that\r\nit is not the vine alone that has been the sign of the glory of the\r\nSouth. There is another sacred tree unstained by loose and violent\r\nmemories, guiltless of the blood of Pentheus or of Orpheus and the\r\nbroken lyre. We shall pass from this place in a little while as all\r\nthings pass and perish:\r\n\r\n                 Far called, our navies melt away.\r\n                   On dune and headland sinks the fire,\r\n                 And all our pomp of yesterday\r\n                   Is one with Nineveh and Tyre.\r\n\r\nBut so long as sun can shine and soil can nourish, happier men and women\r\nafter us shall look on this lovely islet and it shall tell its own\r\nstory; for they shall see these three holy olive trees lifted in\r\neverlasting benediction, over the humble spot out of which came the\r\npeace of the world.”\r\n\r\nThe other two men were staring at Patrick Dalroy; his hand had tightened\r\non the tree, and a giant billow of effort went over his broad breast. A\r\nsmall stone jerked itself out of the ground at the foot of the tree as\r\nif it were a grasshopper jumping; and then the coiled roots of the olive\r\ntree rose very slowly out of the earth like the limbs of a dragon\r\nlifting itself from sleep.\r\n\r\n“I offer an olive branch,” said the King of Ithaca, totteringly leaning\r\nthe loose tree so that its vast shadow, much larger than itself, fell\r\nacross the whole council. “An olive branch,” he gasped, “more glorious\r\nthan my sword. Also heavier.”\r\n\r\nThen he made another effort and tossed it into the sea below.\r\n\r\nThe German, who was no German, had put up his arm in apprehension when\r\nthe shadow fell across him. Now he got up and edged away from the table;\r\nseeing that the wild Irishman was tearing up the second tree. This one\r\ncame out more easily; and before he flung it after the first, he stood\r\nwith it a moment; looking like a man juggling with a tower.\r\n\r\nLord Ivywood showed more firmness; but he rose in tremendous\r\nremonstrance. Only the Turkish Pasha still sat with blank eyes,\r\nimmovable. Dalroy rent out the last tree and hurled it, leaving the\r\nisland bare.\r\n\r\n“There!” said Dalroy, when the third and last olive had splashed in the\r\ntide. “Now I will go. I have seen something today that is worse than\r\ndeath: and the name of it is Peace.”\r\n\r\nOman Pasha rose and held out his hand.\r\n\r\n“You are right,” he said in French, “and I hope we meet again in the\r\nonly life that is a good life. Where are you going now?”\r\n\r\n“I am going,” said Dalroy, dreamily, “to ‘The Old Ship.’”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean?” asked the Turk, “that you are going back to the warships\r\nof the English King?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the other, “I am going back to ‘The Old Ship’ that is\r\nbehind the apple trees by Pebblewick; where the Ule flows among the\r\ntrees. I fear I shall never see you there.”\r\n\r\nAfter an instant’s hesitation he wrung the red hand of the great tyrant\r\nand walked to his boat without a glance at the diplomatists.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                       THE SIGN OF “THE OLD SHIP”\r\n\r\n\r\nUPON few of the children of men has the surname of Pump fallen, and of\r\nthese few have been maddened into naming a child Humphrey in addition to\r\nit. To such extremity, however, had the parents of the innkeeper at “The\r\nOld Ship” proceeded, that their son might come at last to be called\r\n“Hump” by his dearest friends, and “Pumph” by an aged Turk with a green\r\numbrella. All this, or all he knew of it, he endured with a sour smile;\r\nfor he was of a stoical temper.\r\n\r\nMr. Humphrey Pump stood outside his inn, which stood almost on the\r\nseashore, screened only by one line of apple trees, dwarfed, twisted and\r\nsalted by the sea air; but in front of it was a highly banked bowling\r\ngreen, and behind it the land sank abruptly; so that one very steep\r\nsweeping road vanished into the depth and mystery of taller trees. Mr.\r\nPump was standing immediately under his trim sign, which stood erect in\r\nthe turf; a wooden pole painted white and suspending a square white\r\nboard, also painted white but further decorated with a highly grotesque\r\nblue ship, such as a child might draw, but into which Mr. Pump’s\r\npatriotism had insinuated a disproportionately large red St. George’s\r\ncross.\r\n\r\nMr. Humphrey Pump was a man of middle size, with very broad shoulders,\r\nwearing a sort of shooting suit with gaiters. Indeed, he was engaged at\r\nthe moment in cleaning and reloading a double-barrelled gun, a short but\r\npowerful weapon which he had invented, or at least improved, himself;\r\nand which, though eccentric enough as compared with latest scientific\r\narms, was neither clumsy nor necessarily out of date. For Pump was one\r\nof those handy men who seem to have a hundred hands like Briareus; he\r\nmade nearly everything for himself and everything in his house was\r\nslightly different from the same thing in anyone else’s house. He was\r\nalso as cunning as Pan or a poacher in everything affecting every bird\r\nor dish, every leaf or berry in the woods. His mind was a rich soil of\r\nsubconscious memories and traditions; and he had a curious kind of\r\ngossip so allusive as to almost amount to reticence; for he always took\r\nit for granted that everyone knew his county and its tales as intimately\r\nas he did; so he would mention the most mysterious and amazing things\r\nwithout relaxing a muscle on his face, which seemed to be made of\r\nknotted wood. His dark brown hair ended in two rudimentary side\r\nwhiskers, giving him a slightly horsey look, but in the old-fashioned\r\nsportsman’s style. His smile was rather wry and crabbed; but his brown\r\neyes were kindly and soft. He was very English.\r\n\r\nAs a rule his movements, though quick, were cool; but on this occasion\r\nhe put down the gun on the table outside the inn in a rather hurried\r\nmanner and came forward dusting his hands in an unusual degree of\r\nanimation and even defiance. Beyond the goblin green apple trees and\r\nagainst the sea had appeared the tall, slight figure of a girl, in a\r\ndress about the colour of copper and a large shady hat. Under the hat\r\nher face was grave and beautiful though rather swarthy. She shook hands\r\nwith Mr. Pump; then he very ceremoniously put a chair for her and called\r\nher “Lady Joan.”\r\n\r\n“I thought I would like a look at the old place,” she said. “We have had\r\nsome happy times here when we were boys and girls. I suppose you hardly\r\nsee any of your old friends now.”\r\n\r\n“Very little,” answered Pump, rubbing his short whisker reflectively.\r\n“Lord Ivywood’s become quite a Methody parson, you know, since he took\r\nthe place; he’s pulling down beer-shops right and left. And Mr. Charles\r\nwas sent to Australia for lying down flat at the funeral. Pretty stiff I\r\ncall it; but the old lady was a terror.”\r\n\r\n“Do you ever hear,” asked Lady Joan Brett, carelessly, “of that\r\nIrishman, Captain Dalroy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, more often than from the rest,” answered the innkeeper. “He seems\r\nto have done wonders in this Greek business. Ah! He was a sad loss to\r\nthe Navy!”\r\n\r\n“They insulted his country,” said the girl, looking at the sea with a\r\nheightened colour. “After all, Ireland was his country; and he had a\r\nright to resent it being spoken of like that.”\r\n\r\n“And when they found he’d painted him green,” went on Mr. Pump.\r\n\r\n“Painted him what?” asked Lady Joan.\r\n\r\n“Painted Captain Dawson green,” continued Mr. Pump in colourless tones.\r\n“Captain Dawson said green was the colour of Irish traitors, so Dalroy\r\npainted him green. It was a great temptation, no doubt, with this fence\r\nbeing painted at the time and the pail of stuff there; but, of course,\r\nit had a very prejudicial effect on his professional career.”\r\n\r\n“What an extraordinary story!” said the staring Lady Joan, breaking into\r\na rather joyless laugh. “It must go down among your county legends. I\r\nnever heard that version before. Why, it might be the origin of the\r\n‘Green Man’ over there by the town.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” said Pump, simply, “that’s been there since before Waterloo\r\ntimes. Poor old Noyle had it until they put him away. You remember old\r\nNoyle, Lady Joan. Still alive, I hear, and still writing love-letters to\r\nQueen Victoria. Only of course they aren’t posted now.”\r\n\r\n“Have you heard from your Irish friend lately?” asked the girl, keeping\r\na steady eye on the sky-line.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I had a letter last week,” answered the innkeeper. “It seems not\r\nimpossible that he may return to England. He’s been acting for one of\r\nthese Greek places, and the negotiations seem to be concluded. It’s a\r\nqueer thing that his lordship himself was the English minister in charge\r\nof them.”\r\n\r\n“You mean Lord Ivywood,” said Lady Joan, rather coldly. “Yes, he has a\r\ngreat career before him, evidently.”\r\n\r\n“I wish he hadn’t got his knife into us so much,” chuckled Pump. “I\r\ndon’t believe there’ll be an inn left in England. But the Ivywoods were\r\nalways cranky. It’s only fair to him to remember his grandfather.”\r\n\r\n“I think it’s very ungallant on your part,” said Lady Joan, with a\r\nmournful smile, “to ask a lady to remember his grandfather.”\r\n\r\n“You know what I mean, Lady Joan,” said her host, good humouredly. “And\r\nI never was hard on the case myself; we all have our little ways. I\r\nshouldn’t like it done to my pig; but I don’t see why a man shouldn’t\r\nhave his own pig in his own pew with him if he likes it. It wasn’t a\r\nfree seat. It was the family pew.”\r\n\r\nLady Joan broke out laughing again. “What horrible things you do seem to\r\nhave heard of,” she said. “Well, I must be going, Mr. Hump—I mean Mr.\r\nPump—I used to call you Hump ... oh, Hump, do you think any of us will\r\never be happy again?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose it rests with Providence,” he said, looking at the sea.\r\n\r\n“Oh, do say Providence again!” cried the girl. “It’s as good as\r\n‘Masterman Ready.’”\r\n\r\nWith which inconsequent words she betook herself again to the path by\r\nthe apple trees and walked back by the sea front to Pebblewick.\r\n\r\nThe inn of “The Old Ship” lay a little beyond the old fishing village of\r\nPebblewick; and that again was separated by an empty half-mile or so\r\nfrom the new watering-place of Pebblewick-on-Sea. But the dark-haired\r\nlady walked steadily along the sea-front, on a sort of parade which had\r\nbeen stretched out to east and west in the insane optimism of\r\nwatering-places, and, as she approached the more crowded part, looked\r\nmore and more carefully at the groups on the beach. Most of them were\r\nmuch the same as she had seen them more than a month before. The seekers\r\nafter truth (as the man in the fez would say) who assembled daily to\r\nfind out what the man was doing with the paper-boxes, had not found out\r\nyet; neither had they wearied of their intellectual pilgrimage. Pennies\r\nwere still thrown to the thundering atheist in acknowledgment of his\r\nincessant abuse; and this was all the more mysterious because the crowd\r\nwas obviously indifferent, and the atheist was obviously sincere. The\r\nman with the long neck who led Low Church hymns with a little wooden\r\nspade had indeed disappeared; for children’s services of this kind are\r\ngenerally a moving feast; but the man whose only claim consisted of\r\ncarrots round his hat was still there; and seemed to have even more\r\nmoney than before. But Lady Joan could see no sign of the little old man\r\nin the fez. She could only suppose that he had failed entirely; and,\r\nbeing in a bitter mood, she told herself bitterly that he had sunk out\r\nof sight precisely because there was in his rubbish a touch of unearthly\r\nand insane clear-headedness of which all these vulgar idiots were\r\nincapable. She did not confess to herself consciously that what had made\r\nboth the man in the fez and the man at the inn interesting was the\r\nsubject of which they had spoken.\r\n\r\nAs she walked on rather wearily along the parade she caught sight of a\r\ngirl in black with faint fair hair and a tremulous, intelligent face\r\nwhich she was sure she had seen before. Pulling together all her\r\naristocratic training for the remembering of middle class people, she\r\nmanaged to remember that this was a Miss Browning who had done\r\ntypewriting work for her a year or two before; and immediately went\r\nforward to greet her, partly out of genuine good nature and partly as a\r\nrelief from her own rather dreary thoughts. Her tone was so seriously\r\nfrank and friendly that the lady in black summoned the social courage to\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n“I’ve so often wanted to introduce you to my sister who’s much cleverer\r\nthan I am, though she does live at home; which I suppose is very\r\nold-fashioned. She knows all sorts of intellectual people. She is\r\ntalking to one of them now; this Prophet of the Moon that everyone’s\r\ntalking about. Do let me introduce you.”\r\n\r\nLady Joan Brett had met many prophets of the moon and of other things.\r\nBut she had the spontaneous courtesy which redeems the vices of her\r\nclass, and she followed Miss Browning to a seat on the parade. She\r\ngreeted Miss Browning’s sister with glowing politeness; and this may\r\nreally be counted to her credit; for she had great difficulty in looking\r\nat Miss Browning’s sister at all. For on the seat beside her, still in a\r\nred fez but in a brilliantly new black frock coat and every appearance\r\nof prosperity, sat the old gentleman who had lectured on the sands about\r\nthe inns of England.\r\n\r\n“He lectured at our Ethical Society,” whispered Miss Browning, “on the\r\nword Alcohol. Just on the word Alcohol. He was perfectly thrilling. All\r\nabout Arabia and Algebra, you know, and how everything comes from the\r\nEast. You really would be interested.”\r\n\r\n“I am interested,” said Lady Joan.\r\n\r\n“Poot it to yourselfs,” the man in the fez was saying to Miss Browning’s\r\nsister, “joost what sort of meaning the names of your ince can have if\r\nthey do not commemorate the unlimitable influence of Islam. There is a\r\nvary populous Inn in London, one of the most distinguished, one of the\r\nmost of the Centre, and it is called the Horseshoe? Now, my friendss,\r\nwhy should anyone commemorate a horse-shoe? It iss but an appendage to a\r\ncreature more interesting than itself. I have already demonstrated to\r\nyou that the very fact that you have in your town a place of drink\r\ncalled the Bool—”\r\n\r\n“I should like to ask—” began Lady Joan, suddenly.\r\n\r\n“A place of drink called the Bool,” went on the man in the fez, deaf to\r\nall distractions, “and I have urged that the Bool is a disturbing\r\nthought, while the BulBul is a reassuring thought. But even you my\r\nfriends, would not name a place after a ring in a Bool’s nose and not\r\nafter the Bool? Why then name an equivalent place after the shoo, the\r\nmere shoo, upon a horse’s hoof, and not after the noble horse? Surely it\r\nis clear, surely it is evident that the term ‘horse-shoe’ is a cryptic\r\nterm, an esoteric term, a term made during the days when the ancient\r\nMoslem faith of this English country was oppressed by the passing\r\nsuperstition of the Galileans. That bent shape, that duplex curving\r\nshape, which you call horse-shoe, is it not clearly the Crescent?” and\r\nhe cast his arms wide as he had done on the sands, “the Crescent of the\r\nProphet of the only God?”\r\n\r\n“I should like to ask,” began Lady Joan, again, “how you would explain\r\nthe name of the inn called ‘The Green Man,’ just behind that row of\r\nhouses.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly! exactly!” cried the Prophet of the Moon, in almost insane\r\nexcitement. “The seeker after truth could not at all probably find a\r\nmore perfect example of these principles. My friendss, how could there\r\nbe a green man? You are acquainted with green grass, with green leaves,\r\nwith green cheese, with green chartreuse. I ask if any one of you,\r\nhowever wide her social circle, has ever been acquainted with a green\r\nman. Surely, surely, it is evident, my friendss, that this is an\r\nimperfect version, an abbreviated version, of the original words. What\r\ncan be clearer than that the original expression, was ‘the\r\ngreen-turban’d man,’ in allusion to the well-known uniform of the\r\ndescendants of the Prophet? ‘Turban’d’ surely is just the sort of word,\r\nexactly the sort of foreign and unfamiliar word, that might easily be\r\nslurred over and ultimately suppressed.”\r\n\r\n“There is a legend in these parts,” said Lady Joan, steadily, “that a\r\ngreat hero, hearing the colour that was sacred to his holy island\r\ninsulted, really poured it over his enemy for a reply.”\r\n\r\n“A legend! a fable!” cried the man in the fez, with another radiant and\r\nrational expansion of the hands. “Is it not evident that no such thing\r\ncan have really happened?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes—it really happened,” said the young lady, softly. “There is not\r\nmuch to comfort one in this world; but there are some things. Oh, it\r\nreally happened.”\r\n\r\nAnd taking a graceful farewell of the group, she resumed her rather\r\nlistless walk along the parade.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                          THE INN FINDS WINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. HUMPHREY PUMP stood in front of his inn once more, the cleaned and\r\nloaded gun still lay on the table, and the white sign of The Ship still\r\nswung in the slight sea breeze over his head; but his leatherish\r\nfeatures were knotted over a new problem. He held two letters in his\r\nhand, letters of a very different sort, but letters that pointed to the\r\nsame difficult problem. The first ran:\r\n\r\n    “DEAR HUMP—\r\n\r\n    “I’m so bothered that I simply must call you by the old name\r\n    again. You understand I’ve got to keep in with my people. Lord\r\n    Ivywood is a sort of cousin of mine, and for that and some other\r\n    reasons, my poor old mother would just die if I offended him.\r\n    You know her heart is weak; you know everything there is to know\r\n    in this county. Well, I only write to warn you that something is\r\n    going to be done against your dear old inn. I don’t know what\r\n    this Country’s coming to. Only a month or two ago I saw a shabby\r\n    old pantaloon on the beach with a green gamp, talking the\r\n    craziest stuff you ever heard in your life. Three weeks ago I\r\n    heard he was lecturing at Ethical Societies—whatever they\r\n    are—for a handsome salary. Well, when I was last at Ivywood—I\r\n    must go because Mamma likes it—there was the living lunatic\r\n    again, in evening dress, and talked about by people who really\r\n    _know_. I mean who know better.\r\n\r\n    “Lord Ivywood is entirely under his influence and thinks him the\r\n    greatest prophet the world has ever seen. And Lord Ivywood is\r\n    not a fool; one can’t help admiring him. Mamma, I think, wants\r\n    me to do more than admire him. I am telling you everything,\r\n    Hump, because I think perhaps this is the last honest letter I\r\n    shall ever write in the world. And I warn you seriously that\r\n    Lord Ivywood is _sincere_, which is perfectly terrible. He will\r\n    be the biggest English statesman, and he does really mean to\r\n    ruin—the old ships. If ever you see me here again taking part in\r\n    such work, I hope you may forgive me.\r\n\r\n    “Somebody we mentioned, whom I shall never see again, I leave to\r\n    your friendship. It is the second best thing I can give, and I\r\n    am not sure it may not be better than the first would have been.\r\n    Goodbye.\r\n\r\n                                                              J. B.”\r\n\r\nThis letter seemed to distress Mr. Pump rather than puzzle him. It ran\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    “SIR—\r\n\r\n    “The Committee of the Imperial Commission of Liquor Control is\r\n    directed to draw your attention to the fact that you have\r\n    disregarded the Committee’s communications under section 5A of\r\n    the Act for the Regulation of Places of Public Entertainment;\r\n    and that you are now under Section 47C of the Act amending the\r\n    Act for the Regulation of Places of Public Entertainment\r\n    aforesaid. The charges on which prosecution will be founded are\r\n    as follows:\r\n\r\n        (1) Violation of sub-section 23_f_ of the Act, which enacts\r\n           that no pictorial signs shall be exhibited before\r\n           premises of less than the ratable value of £2000 per\r\n           annum.\r\n\r\n        (2) Violation of sub-section 113_d_ of the Act, which enacts\r\n           that no liquor containing alcohol shall be sold in any\r\n           inn, hotel, tavern or public-house, except when demanded\r\n           under a medical certificate from one of the doctors\r\n           licensed by the State Medical Council, or in the\r\n           specially excepted cases of Claridge’s Hotel and the\r\n           Criterion Bar, where urgency has already been proved.\r\n\r\n    “As you have failed to acknowledge previous communications on\r\n    this subject, this is to warn you that legal steps will be taken\r\n    immediately,\r\n\r\n              “We are yours truly,\r\n\r\n         IVYWOOD, _President_.\r\n\r\n         J. LEVESON, _Secretary_.”\r\n\r\nMr. Humphrey Pump sat down at the table outside his inn and whistled in\r\na way which, combined with his little whiskers made him for the moment\r\nseem literally like an ostler. Then, the very real wit and learning he\r\nhad returned slowly into his face and with his warm, brown eyes he\r\nconsidered the cold, grey sea. There was not much to be got out of the\r\nsea. Humphrey Pump might drown himself in the sea; which would be better\r\nfor Humphrey Pump than being finally separated from “The Old Ship.”\r\nEngland might be sunk under the sea; which would be better for England\r\nthan never again having such places as “The Old Ship.” But these were\r\nnot serious remedies nor rationally attainable; and Pump could only feel\r\nthat the sea had simply warped him as it had warped his apple trees. The\r\nsea was a dreary business altogether. There was only one figure walking\r\non the sands. It was only when the figure drew nearer and nearer and\r\ngrew to more than human size, that he sprang to his feet with a cry.\r\nAlso the level light of morning lit the man’s hair, and it was red.\r\n\r\nThe late King of Ithaca came casually and slowly up the slope of the\r\nbeach that led to “The Old Ship.” He had landed in a boat from a\r\nbattleship that could still be seen near the horizon, and he still wore\r\nthe astounding uniform of apple-green and silver which he had himself\r\ninvented as that of a navy that had never existed very much, and which\r\nnow did not exist at all. He had a straight naval sword at his side; for\r\nthe terms of his capitulation had never required him to surrender it;\r\nand inside the uniform and beside the sword there was what there always\r\nhad been, a big and rather bewildered man with rough red hair, whose\r\nmisfortune was that he had good brains, but that his bodily strength and\r\nbodily passions were a little too strong for his brains.\r\n\r\nHe had flung his crashing weight on the chair outside the inn before the\r\ninnkeeper could find words to express his astounded pleasure in seeing\r\nhim. His first words were “have you got any rum?”\r\n\r\nThen, as if feeling that his attitude needed explanation, he added, “I\r\nsuppose I shall never be a sailor again after tonight. So I must have\r\nrum.”\r\n\r\nHumphrey Pump had a talent for friendship, and understood his old\r\nfriend. He went into the inn without a word; and came back idly pushing\r\nor rolling with an alternate foot (as if he were playing football with\r\ntwo footballs at once) two objects that rolled very easily. One was a\r\nbig keg or barrel of rum and the other a great solid drum of a cheese.\r\nAmong his thousand other technical tricks he had a way of tapping a cask\r\nwithout a tap, or anything that could impair its revolutionary or\r\nrevolving qualities. He was feeling in his pocket for the instrument\r\nwith which he solved such questions, when his Irish friend suddenly sat\r\nbolt upright, as one startled out of sleep, and spoke with his strongest\r\nand most unusual brogue.\r\n\r\n“Oh thank ye, Hump, a thousand times; and I don’t think I really want\r\nsomething to drink at arl. Now I know I can have it, I don’t seem to\r\nwant it at arl. But hwhat I do want—” and he suddenly dashed his big\r\nfist on the little table so that one of its legs leapt and nearly\r\nsnapped—“hwhat I do want is some sort of account of what’s happening in\r\nthis England of yours that shan’t be just obviously rubbish.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Pump, fingering the two letters thoughtfully. “And what do\r\nyou mean by rubbish?”\r\n\r\n“I carl it rubbish” cried Patrick Dalroy, “when ye put the Koran into\r\nthe Bible and not the Apocrypha; and I carl it rubbish when a mad\r\nparson’s allowed to propose to put a crescent on St. Paul’s Cathedral. I\r\nknow the Turks are our allies now, but they often were before, and I\r\nnever heard that Palmerston or Colin Campbell had any truck with such\r\ntrash.”\r\n\r\n“Lord Ivywood is very enthusiastic, I know,” said Pump, with a\r\nrestrained amusement. “He was saying only the other day at the Flower\r\nShow here that the time had come for a full unity between Christianity\r\nand Islam.”\r\n\r\n“Something called Chrislam perhaps,” said the Irishman, with a moody\r\neye. He was gazing across the grey and purple woodlands that stretched\r\nbelow them at the back of the inn; and into which the steep, white road\r\nswept downwards and disappeared. The steep road looked like the\r\nbeginning of an adventure; and he was an adventurer.\r\n\r\n“But you exaggerate, you know,” went on Pump, polishing his gun, “about\r\nthe crescent on St. Paul’s. It wasn’t exactly that. What Dr. Moole\r\nsuggested, I think, was some sort of double emblem, you know, combining\r\ncross and crescent.”\r\n\r\n“And called the Crescent,” muttered Dalroy.\r\n\r\n“And you can’t call Dr. Moole a parson either,” went on Mr. Humphrey\r\nPump, polishing industriously. “Why, they say he’s a sort of atheist, or\r\nwhat they call an agnostic, like Squire Brunton who used to bite elm\r\ntrees by Marley. The grand folks have these fashions, Captain, but\r\nthey’ve never lasted long that I know of.”\r\n\r\n“I think it’s serious this time,” said his friend, shaking his big red\r\nhead. “This is the last inn on this coast, and will soon be the last inn\r\nin England. Do you remember the ‘Saracen’s Head’ in Plumsea, along the\r\nshore there?”\r\n\r\n“I know,” assented the innkeeper. “My aunt was there when he hanged his\r\nmother; but it’s a charming place.”\r\n\r\n“I passed there just now; and it has been destroyed,” said Dalroy.\r\n\r\n“Destroyed by fire?” asked Pump, pausing in his gun-scrubbing.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Dalroy, “destroyed by lemonade. They’ve taken away its\r\nlicense or whatever you call it. I made a song about it, which I’ll sing\r\nto you now!” And with an astounding air of suddenly revived spirits, he\r\nroared in a voice like thunder the following verses, to a simple but\r\nspirited tune of his own invention:\r\n\r\n          “The Saracen’s Head looks down the lane,\r\n           Where we shall never drink wine again;\r\n           For the wicked old Women who feel well-bred\r\n           Have turned to a tea-shop the Saracen’s Head.\r\n\r\n          “The Saracen’s Head out of Araby came,\r\n           King Richard riding in arms like flame,\r\n           And where he established his folk to be fed\r\n           He set up his spear—and the Saracen’s Head.\r\n\r\n          “But the Saracen’s Head outlived the Kings,\r\n           It thought and it thought of most horrible things;\r\n           Of Health and of Soap and of Standard Bread,\r\n           And of Saracen drinks at the Saracen’s Head.”\r\n\r\n“Hullo!” cried Pump, with another low whistle. “Why here comes his\r\nlordship. And I suppose that young man in the goggles is a Committee or\r\nsomething.”\r\n\r\n“Let him come,” said Dalroy, and continued in a yet more earthquake\r\nbellow:\r\n\r\n              “So the Saracen’s Head fulfils its name,\r\n               They drink no wine—a ridiculous game—\r\n               And I shall wonder until I’m dead,\r\n               How it ever came into the Saracen’s Head.”\r\n\r\nAs the last echo of this lyrical roar rolled away among the apple-trees,\r\nand down the steep, white road into the woods, Captain Dalroy leaned\r\nback in his chair and nodded good humouredly to Lord Ivywood, who was\r\nstanding on the lawn with his usual cold air, but with slightly\r\ncompressed lips. Behind him was a dark young man with double eyeglasses\r\nand a number of printed papers in his hand; presumably J. Leveson,\r\nSecretary. In the road outside stood a group of three which struck Pump\r\nas strangely incongruous, like a group in a three act farce. The first\r\nwas a police inspector in uniform; the second was a workman in a leather\r\napron, more or less like a carpenter, and the third was an old man in a\r\nscarlet Turkish fez, but otherwise dressed in very fashionable English\r\nclothes in which he did not seem very comfortable. He was explaining\r\nsomething about the inn to the policeman and the carpenter, who appeared\r\nto be restraining their amusement.\r\n\r\n“Fine song that, my lord,” said Dalroy, with cheerful egotism. “I’ll\r\nsing you another,” and he cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Pump,” said Lord Ivywood, in his bell-like and beautiful voice, “I\r\nthought I would come in person, if only to make it clear that every\r\nindulgence has been shown you. The mere date of this inn brings it\r\nwithin the statute of 1909; it was erected when my great grandfather was\r\nLord of the Manor here, though I believe it then bore a different name,\r\nand——”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my lord,” broke in Pump with a sigh, “I’d rather deal with your\r\ngreat grandfather, I would, though he married a hundred negresses\r\ninstead of one, than see a gentleman of your family taking away a poor\r\nman’s livelihood.”\r\n\r\n“The act is specially designed in the interests of the relief of\r\npoverty,” proceeded Lord Ivywood, in an unruffled manner, “and its final\r\nadvantages will accrue to all citizens alike.” He turned for an instant\r\nto the dark secretary, saying, “You have that second report?” and\r\nreceived a folded paper in answer.\r\n\r\n“It is here fully explained,” said Lord Ivywood, putting on his elderly\r\neyeglasses, “that the purpose of the Act is largely to protect the\r\nsavings of the more humble and necessitous classes. I find in paragraph\r\nthree, ‘we strongly advise that the deleterious element of alcohol be\r\nmade illegal save in such few places as the Government may specially\r\nexempt for Parliamentary or other public reasons, and that the\r\nprovocative and demoralising display on inn signs be strictly forbidden\r\nexcept in the cases thus specially exempted: the absence of such\r\ntemptations will, in our opinion, do much to improve the precarious\r\nfinancial conditions of the working class.’ That disposes, I think, of\r\nany such suggestion as Mr. Pump’s, that our inevitable acts of social\r\nreform are in any sense oppressive. To Mr. Pump’s prejudice it may\r\nappear for the moment to bear hardly upon him; but” (and here Lord\r\nIvywood’s voice took one of its moving oratorical turns), “what better\r\nproof could we desire of the insidiousness of the sleepy poison we\r\ndenounce, what better evidence could we offer of the civic corruption\r\nthat we seek to cure, than the very fact that good and worthy men of\r\nestablished repute in the county can, by living in such places as these,\r\nbecome so stagnant and sodden and unsocial, whether through the fumes of\r\nwine or through meditations as maudlin about the past, that they\r\nconsider the case solely as their own case, and laugh at the long agony\r\nof the poor.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Dalroy had been studying Ivywood with a very bright blue eye;\r\nand he spoke now much more quietly than he generally did.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me one moment, my lord,” he said. “But there was one point in\r\nyour important explanation which I am not sure I have got right. Do I\r\nunderstand you to say that, though sign-boards are to be generally\r\nabolished, yet where, if anywhere, they are retained, the right to sell\r\nfermented liquor will be retained also? In other words, though an\r\nEnglishman may at last find only one inn-sign left in England, yet if\r\nthe place has an inn-sign, it will also have your gracious permission to\r\nbe really an inn?”\r\n\r\nLord Ivywood had an admirable command of temper, which had helped him\r\nmuch in his career as a statesman. He did not waste time in wrangling\r\nabout the Captain’s _locus standi_ in the matter. He replied quite\r\nsimply,\r\n\r\n“Yes, Your statement of the facts is correct.”\r\n\r\n“Whenever I find an inn-sign permitted by the police, I may go in and\r\nask for a glass of beer—also permitted by the police.”\r\n\r\n“If you find any such, yes,” answered Ivywood, quite temperately. “But\r\nwe hope soon to have removed them altogether.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Patrick Dalroy rose enormously from his seat with a sort of\r\nstretch and yawn.\r\n\r\n“Well, Hump,” he said to his friend, “the best thing, it seems to me, is\r\nto take the important things with us.”\r\n\r\nWith two sight-staggering kicks he sent the keg of rum and the round\r\ncheese flying over the fence, in such a direction that they bounded on\r\nthe descending road and rolled more and more rapidly down toward the\r\ndark woods into which the path disappeared. Then he gripped the pole of\r\nthe inn-sign, shook it twice and plucked it out of the turf like a tuft\r\nof grass.\r\n\r\nIt had all happened before anyone could move, but as he strode out into\r\nthe road the policeman ran forward. Dalroy smote him flat across face\r\nand chest with the wooden sign-board, so as to send him flying into the\r\nditch on the other side of the road. Then turning on the man in the fez\r\nhe poked him with the end of the pole so sharply in his new white\r\nwaistcoat and watch-chain as to cause him to sit down suddenly in the\r\nroad, looking very serious and thoughtful.\r\n\r\nThe dark secretary made a movement of rescue, but Humphrey Pump, with a\r\ncry, caught up his gun from the table and pointed it at him, which so\r\nalarmed J. Leveson, Secretary, as to cause him almost to double up with\r\nhis emotions. The next moment Pump, with his gun under his arm, was\r\nscampering down the hill after the Captain, who was scampering after the\r\nbarrel and the cheese.\r\n\r\nBefore the policeman had struggled out of the ditch, they had all\r\ndisappeared into the darkness of the forest. Lord Ivywood who had\r\nremained firm through the scene, without a sign of fear or impatience\r\n(or, I will add, amusement), held up his hand and stopped the policeman\r\nin his pursuit.\r\n\r\n“We should only make ourselves and the law ridiculous,” he said, “by\r\npursuing those ludicrous rowdies now. They can’t escape or do any real\r\nharm in the state of modern communications. What is far more important,\r\ngentlemen, is to destroy their stores and their base. Under the Act of\r\n1911 we have a right to confiscate and destroy any property in an inn\r\nwhere the law has been violated.”\r\n\r\nAnd he stood for hours on the lawn, watching the smashing of bottles and\r\nthe breaking up of casks and feeding on fanatical pleasure: the pleasure\r\nhis strange, cold, courageous nature could not get from food or wine or\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                     THE ASTONISHMENT OF THE AGENT\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD IVYWOOD shared the mental weakness of most men who have fed on\r\nbooks; he ignored, not the value but the very existence of other forms\r\nof information. Thus Humphrey Pump was perfectly aware that Lord Ivywood\r\nconsidered him an ignorant man who carried a volume of Pickwick and\r\ncould not be got to read any other book. But Lord Ivywood was quite\r\nunaware that Humphrey never looked at him without thinking that he could\r\nbe most successfully hidden in a wood of small beeches, as his\r\ngrey-brown hair and sallow, ashen face exactly reproduced the three\r\npredominant tints of such a sylvan twilight. Mr. Pump, I fear, had\r\nsometimes partaken of partridge or pheasant, in his early youth, under\r\ncircumstances in which Lord Ivywood was not only unconscious of the\r\nhospitality he was dispensing, but would have sworn that it was\r\nphysically impossible for anyone to elude the vigilance of his efficient\r\nsystem of game-keeping. But it is very unwise in one who counts himself\r\nsuperior to physical things to talk about physical impossibility.\r\n\r\nLord Ivywood was in error, therefore, when he said that the fugitives\r\ncould not possibly escape in modern England. You can do a great many\r\nthings in modern England if you have noticed; some things, in fact,\r\nwhich others know by pictures or current speech; if you know, for\r\ninstance, that most roadside hedges are taller and denser than they\r\nlook, and that even the largest man lying just behind them, takes up far\r\nless room than you would suppose; if you know that many natural sounds\r\nare much more like each other than the enlightened ear can believe, as\r\nin the case of wind in leaves and of the sea; if you know that it is\r\neasier to walk in socks than in boots, if you know how to take hold of\r\nthe ground; if you know that the proportion of dogs who will bite a man\r\nunder any circumstances is rather less than the proportion of men who\r\nwill murder you in a railway carriage; if you know that you need not be\r\ndrowned even in a river, unless the tide is very strong, and unless you\r\npractise putting yourself into the special attitudes of a suicide; if\r\nyou know that country stations have objectless, extra waiting rooms that\r\nnobody ever goes into; and if you know that county folk will forget you\r\nif you speak to them, but talk about you all day if you don’t.\r\n\r\nBy the exercise of these and other arts and sciences Humphrey Pump was\r\nable to guide his friend across country, mostly in the character of\r\ntrespasser and occasionally in that of something like housebreaker, and\r\neventually, with sign, keg, cheese and all to step out of a black\r\npinewood onto a white road in a part of the county where they would not\r\nbe sought for the present.\r\n\r\nOpposite them was a cornfield and on their right, in the shades of the\r\npine trees, a cottage, a very tumbledown cottage that seemed to have\r\ncollapsed under its own thatch. The red-haired Irishman’s face wore a\r\ncurious smile. He stuck the inn-sign erect in the road and went and\r\nhammered on the door.\r\n\r\nIt was opened tremulously by an old man with a face so wrinkled that the\r\nwrinkles seemed more distinctly graven than the features themselves,\r\nwhich seemed lost in the labyrinth of them. He might have crawled out of\r\nthe hole in a gnarled tree and he might have been a thousand years old.\r\n\r\nHe did not seem to notice the sign-board, which stood rather to the left\r\nof the door; and what life remained in his eyes seemed to awake in\r\nwonder at Dalroy’s stature and strange uniform and the sword at his\r\nside. “I beg your pardon,” said the Captain, courteously. “I fear my\r\nuniform startles you. It is Lord Ivywood’s livery. All his servants are\r\nto dress like this. In fact, I understand the tenants also and even\r\nyourself, perhaps ... excuse my sword. Lord Ivywood is very particular\r\nthat every man should have a sword. You know his beautiful, eloquent way\r\nof putting his views. ‘How can we profess,’ he was saying to me\r\nyesterday, while I was brushing his trousers. ‘How can we profess that\r\nall men are brothers while we refuse to them the symbol of manhood; or\r\nwith what assurance can we claim it as a movement of modern emancipation\r\nto deny the citizen that which has in all ages marked the difference\r\nbetween the free man and the slave. Nor need we anticipate any such\r\nbarbaric abuses as my honourable friend who is cleaning the knives has\r\nprophesied, for this gift is a sublime act of confidence in your\r\nuniversal passion for the severe splendours of Peace; and he that has\r\nthe right to strike is he who has learnt to spare.’”\r\n\r\nTalking all this nonsense with extreme rapidity and vast oratorical\r\nflourishes of the hand, Captain Dalroy proceeded to trundle both the big\r\ncheese and the cask of rum into the house of the astonished cottager:\r\nMr. Pump following with a grim placidity and his gun under his arm.\r\n\r\n“Lord Ivywood,” said Dalroy, setting the rum cask with a bump on the\r\nplain deal table, “wishes to take wine with you. Or, more strictly\r\nspeaking, rum. Don’t you run away, my friend, with any of these stories\r\nabout Lord Ivywood being opposed to drink. Three-bottle Ivywood, we call\r\nhim in the kitchen. But it must be rum; nothing but rum for the\r\nIvywoods. ‘Wine may be a mocker,’ he was saying the other day (and I\r\nparticularly noted the phrasing, which seemed to be very happy even for\r\nhis lordship; he was standing at the top of the steps, and I stopped\r\ncleaning them to make a note of it), ‘wine may be a mocker; strong drink\r\nmay be raging, but nowhere in the sacred pages will you find one word of\r\ncensure of the sweeter spirit sacred to them that go down to the sea in\r\nships; no tongue of priest and prophet was ever lifted to break the\r\nsacred silence of Holy Writ about Rum.’ He then explained to me,” went\r\non Dalroy, signing to Pump to tap the cask according to his own\r\ntechnical secret, “that the great tip for avoiding any bad results that\r\na bottle or two of rum might have on young and inexperienced people was\r\nto eat cheese with it, particularly this kind of cheese that I have\r\nhere. I’ve forgotten its name.”\r\n\r\n“Cheddar,” said Pump, quite gravely.\r\n\r\n“But mind you!” continued the Captain almost ferociously, shaking his\r\nbig finger in warning at the aged man. “Mind you ‘no _bread_ with the\r\ncheese. All the devastating ruin wrought by cheese and the once happy\r\nhomes of this country, has been due to the reckless and insane\r\nexperiment of eating bread with it.’ You’ll get no bread from me, my\r\nfriend. Indeed, Lord Ivywood has given directions that the allusion to\r\nthis ignorant and depraved habit shall be eliminated from the Lord’s\r\nPrayer. Have a drink.”\r\n\r\nHe had already poured out a little of the spirit into two thick tumblers\r\nand a broken teacup, which he had induced the aged man to produce; and\r\nnow solemnly pledged him.\r\n\r\n“Thank ye kindly, sir,” said the old man, using his cracked voice for\r\nthe first time. Then he drank; and his old face changed as if it were an\r\nold horn lantern in which the flame began to rise.\r\n\r\n“Ar,” he said. “My son he be a sailor.”\r\n\r\n“I wish him a happy voyage,” said the Captain. “And I’ll sing you a song\r\nabout the first sailor there ever was in the world; and who (as Lord\r\nIvywood acutely observes) lived before the time of rum.”\r\n\r\nHe sat down on a wooden chair and lifted his loud voice once more,\r\nbeating on the table with the broken tea-cup.\r\n\r\n “Old Noah, he had an ostrich farm, and fowls on the greatest scale;\r\n  He ate his egg with a ladle in an egg-cup big as a pail,\r\n  And the soup he took was Elephant Soup and the fish he took was Whale;\r\n  But they all were small to the cellar he took when he set out to sail;\r\n  And Noah, he often said to his wife when he sat down to dine,\r\n  ‘I don’t care where the water goes if it doesn’t get into the wine.’\r\n\r\n “The cataract of the cliff of heaven fell blinding off the brink,\r\n  As if it would wash the stars away as suds go down a sink,\r\n  The seven heavens came roaring down for the throats of hell to drink,\r\n  And Noah, he cocked his eye and said, ‘It looks like rain, I think,\r\n  The water has drowned the Matterhorn as deep as a Mendip mine,\r\n  But I don’t care where the water goes if it doesn’t get into the wine.’\r\n\r\n “But Noah he sinned, and we have sinned; on tipsy feet we trod,\r\n  Till a great big black teetotaller was sent to us for a rod,\r\n  And you can’t get wine at a P.S.A. or chapel or Eisteddfod;\r\n  For the Curse of Water has come again because of the wrath of God,\r\n  And water is on the Bishop’s board and the Higher Thinker’s shrine,\r\n  But I don’t care where the water goes if it doesn’t get into the wine.”\r\n\r\n“Lord Ivywood’s favorite song,” concluded Mr. Patrick Dalroy, drinking.\r\n“Sing us a song yourself.”\r\n\r\nRather to the surprise of the two humourists, the old gentleman actually\r\nbegan in a quavering voice to chant,\r\n\r\n                “King George that lives in London Town,\r\n                 I hope they will defend his crown,\r\n                 And Bonyparte be quite put down\r\n                     On Christmas Day in the morning.\r\n\r\n                “Old Squire is gone to the Meet today\r\n                 All in his——”\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps fortunate for the rapidity of this narrative that the old\r\ngentleman’s favourite song, which consists of forty-seven verses, was\r\ninterrupted by a curious incident. The door of the cottage opened and a\r\nsheepish-looking man in corduroys stood silently in the room for a few\r\nseconds and then said, without preface or further explanation,\r\n\r\n“Four ale.”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon?” inquired the polite Captain.\r\n\r\n“Four ale,” said the man with solidity; then catching sight of Humphrey\r\nseemed to find a few more words in his vocabulary.\r\n\r\n“Morning, Mr. Pump. Didn’t know as how you’d moved ‘The Old Ship.’”\r\n\r\nMr. Pump, with a twist of a smile, pointed to the old man whose song had\r\nbeen interrupted.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Marne’s seeing after it now, Mr. Gowl,” said Pump with the strict\r\netiquette of the country side. “But he’s got nothing but this rum in\r\nstock as yet.”\r\n\r\n“Better’nowt,” said the laconic Mr. Gowl; and put down some money in\r\nfront of the aged Marne, who eyed it wonderingly. As he was turning with\r\na farewell and wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, the door once\r\nmore moved, letting in white sunlight and a man in a red neckerchief.\r\n\r\n“Morning, Mr. Marne; Morning, Mr. Pump; Morning, Mr. Gowl,” said the man\r\nin the red neckerchief.\r\n\r\n“Morning, Mr. Coote,” said the other three, one after another.\r\n\r\n“Have some rum, Mr. Coote?” asked Humphrey Pump, genially. “That’s all\r\nMr. Marne’s got just now.”\r\n\r\nMr. Coote also had a little rum; and also laid a little money under the\r\nrather vague gaze of the venerable cottager. Mr. Coote was just\r\nproceeding to explain that these were bad times, but if you saw a sign\r\nyou were all right still; a lawyer up at Grunton Abbot had told him so;\r\nwhen the company was increased and greatly excited by the arrival of a\r\nboisterous and popular tinker, who ordered glasses all round and said he\r\nhad his donkey and cart outside. A prolonged, rich and confused\r\nconversation about the donkey and cart then ensued, in which the most\r\nvaried views were taken of their merits; and it gradually began to dawn\r\non Dalroy that the tinker was trying to sell them.\r\n\r\nAn idea, suited to the romantic opportunism of his present absurd\r\ncareer, suddenly swept over his mind, and he rushed out to look at the\r\ncart and donkey. The next moment he was back again, asking the tinker\r\nwhat his price was, and almost in the same breath offering a much bigger\r\nprice than the tinker would have dreamed of asking. This was considered,\r\nhowever, as a lunacy specially allowed to gentlemen; the tinker had some\r\nmore rum on the strength of the payment, and then Dalroy, offering his\r\nexcuses, sealed up the cask and took it and the cheese to be stowed in\r\nthe bottom of the cart. The money, however, he still left lying in\r\nshining silver and copper before the silver beard of old Marne.\r\n\r\nNo one acquainted with the quaint and often wordless camaraderie of the\r\nEnglish poor will require to be told that they all went out and stared\r\nat him as he loaded the cart and saw to the harness of the donkey—all\r\nexcept the old cottager, who sat as if hypnotised by the sight of the\r\nmoney. While they were standing there they saw coming down the white,\r\nhot road, where it curled over the hill, a figure that gave them no\r\npleasure, even when it was a mere marching black spot in the distance.\r\nIt was a Mr. Bullrose, the agent of Lord Ivywood’s estates.\r\n\r\nMr. Bullrose was a short, square man with a broad, square head with\r\nridges of close, black curls on it, with a heavy, froglike face and\r\nstarting, suspicious eyes; a man with a good silk hat but a square\r\nbusiness jacket. Mr. Bullrose was not a nice man. The agent on that sort\r\nof estate hardly ever is a nice man. The landlord often is; and even\r\nLord Ivywood had an arctic magnanimity of his own, which made most\r\npeople want, if possible, to see him personally. But Mr. Bullrose was\r\npetty. Every really practical tyrant must be petty.\r\n\r\nHe evidently failed to understand the commotion in front of Mr. Marne’s\r\npartly collapsed cottage, but he felt there must be something wrong\r\nabout it. He wanted to get rid of the cottage altogether, and had not,\r\nof course, the faintest intention of giving the cottager any\r\ncompensation for it. He hoped the old man would die; but in any case he\r\ncould easily clear him out if it became suddenly necessary, for he could\r\nnot possibly pay the rent for this week. The rent was not very much; but\r\nit was immeasurably too much for the old man who had no conceivable way\r\nof borrowing or earning it. That is where the chivalry of our\r\naristocratic land system comes in.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, my friends,” the enormous man in the fantastic uniform was\r\nsaying, “all roads lead to rum, as Lord Ivywood said in one of his gayer\r\nmoments, and we hope to be back soon, establishing a first class hotel\r\nhere, of which prospectuses will soon be sent out.”\r\n\r\nThe heavy froglike face of Mr. Bullrose, the agent, grew uglier with\r\nastonishment; and the eyes stood out more like a snail’s than a frog’s.\r\nThe indefensible allusion to Lord Ivywood would in any case have caused\r\na choleric intervention, if it had not been swallowed up in the\r\nearthquake suggestion of an unlicensed hotel on the estate. This again\r\nwould have effected the explosion, if that and everything else had not\r\nbeen struck still and rigid by the sight of a solid, wooden sign-post\r\nalready erected outside old Marne’s miserable cottage.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got him now,” muttered Mr. Bullrose. “He can’t possibly pay; and\r\nout he shall go.” And he walked swiftly towards the door of the cottage,\r\nalmost at the same moment that Dalroy went to the donkey’s head, as if\r\nto lead it off along the road.\r\n\r\n“Look here, my man,” burst out Bullrose, the instant he was inside the\r\ncottage. “You’ve cooked yourself this time. His lordship has been a\r\ngreat deal too indulgent with you; but this is going to be the end of\r\nit. The insolence of what you’ve done outside, especially when you know\r\nhis lordship’s wishes in such things, has just put the lid on.” He\r\nstopped a moment and sneered. “So unless you happen to have the exact\r\nrent down to a farthing or two about you, out you go. We’re sick of your\r\nsort.”\r\n\r\nIn a very awkward and fumbling manner, the old man pushed a heap of\r\ncoins across the table. Mr. Bullrose sat down suddenly on the wooden\r\nchair with his silk hat on, and began counting them furiously. He\r\ncounted them once; he counted them twice; and he counted them again.\r\nThen he stared at them more steadily than the cottager had done.\r\n\r\n“Where did you get this money?” he asked in a thick, gross voice. “Did\r\nyou steal it?”\r\n\r\n“I ain’t very spry for stealin’,” said the old man in quavering comedy.\r\n\r\nBullrose looked at him and then at the money; and remembered with fury\r\nthat Ivywood was a just though cold magistrate on the bench.\r\n\r\n“Well, anyhow,” he cried, in a hot, heady way, “we’ve got enough against\r\nyou to turn you out of this. Haven’t you broken the law, my man, to say\r\nnothing of the regulations for tenants, in sticking up that fancy sign\r\nof yours outside the cottage? Eh?”\r\n\r\nThe tenant was silent.\r\n\r\n“Eh?” reiterated the agent.\r\n\r\n“Ar,” replied the tenant.\r\n\r\n“Have you or have you not a sign-board outside this house?” shouted\r\nBullrose, hammering the table.\r\n\r\nThe tenant looked at him for a long time with a patient and venerable\r\nface, and then said: “Mubbe, yes. Mubbe, no.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll mubbe you,” cried Mr. Bullrose, springing up and sticking his silk\r\nhat on the back of his head. “I don’t know whether you people are too\r\ndrunk to see anything, but I saw the thing with my own eyes out in the\r\nroad. Come out, and deny it if you dare!”\r\n\r\n“Ar,” said Mr. Marne, dubiously.\r\n\r\nHe tottered after the agent, who flung open the door with a businesslike\r\nfury and stood outside on the threshold. He stood there quite a long\r\ntime, and he did not speak. Deep in the hardened mud of his\r\nmaterialistic mind there had stirred two things that were its ancient\r\nenemies; the old fairy tale in which every thing can be believed; the\r\nnew scepticism in which nothing can be believed—not even one’s own eyes.\r\nThere was no sign, nor sign of a sign, in the landscape.\r\n\r\nOn the withered face of the old man Marne there was a faint renewal of\r\nthat laughter that has slept since the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                           THE HOLE IN HEAVEN\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT delicate ruby light which is one of the rarest but one of the most\r\nexquisite of evening effects warmed the land, sky and seas as if the\r\nwhole world were washed in wine; and dyed almost scarlet the strong red\r\nhead of Patrick Dalroy as he stood on the waste of furze and bracken,\r\nwhere he and his friends had halted. One of his friends was re-examining\r\na short gun, rather like a double-barrelled carbine, the other was\r\neating thistles.\r\n\r\nDalroy himself was idle and ruminant, with his hands in his pockets and\r\nhis eye on the horizon. Landwards the hills, plains and woods lay bathed\r\nin the rose-red light; but it changed somewhat to purple, to cloud and\r\nsomething like storm over the distant violet strip of sea. It was\r\ntowards the sea that he was staring.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he woke up; and seemed almost to rub his eyes, or at any rate,\r\nto rub his red eyebrow.\r\n\r\n“Why, we’re on the road back of Pebblewick,” he said. “That’s the damned\r\nlittle tin chapel by the beach.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” answered his friend and guide. “We’ve done the old hare trick;\r\ndoubled, you know. Nine times out of ten it’s the best. Parson Whitelady\r\nused to do it when they were after him for dog-stealing. I’ve pretty\r\nmuch followed his trail; you can’t do better than stick to the best\r\nexamples. They tell you in London that Dick Turpin rode to York. Well, I\r\nknow he didn’t; for my old grandfather up at Cobble’s End knew the\r\nTurpins intimately—threw one of them into the river on a Christmas day;\r\nbut I think I can guess what he did do and how the tale got about. If\r\nDick was wise, he went flying up the old North Road, shouting ‘York!\r\nYork!’ or what not, before people recognised him; then if he did the\r\nthing properly, he might half an hour afterwards walk down the Strand\r\nwith a pipe in his mouth. They say old Boney said, ‘Go where you aren’t\r\nexpected,’ and I suppose as a soldier he was right. But for a gentleman\r\ndodging the police like yourself, it isn’t exactly the right way of\r\nputting it. I should say, ‘Go where you ought to be expected’—and you’ll\r\ngenerally find your fellow creatures don’t do what they ought about\r\nexpecting any more than about anything else.”\r\n\r\n“Well, this bit between here and the sea,” said the Captain, in a brown\r\nstudy, “I know it so well—so well that—that I rather wish I’d never seen\r\nit again. Do you know,” he asked, suddenly pointing to a patch and pit\r\nof sand that showed white in the dusky heath a hundred yards away, “do\r\nyou know what makes that spot so famous in history?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Mr. Pump, “that’s where old Mother Grouch shot the\r\nMethodist.”\r\n\r\n“You are in error,” said the Captain. “Such an incident as you describe\r\nwould in no case call for special comment or regret. No, that spot is\r\nfamous because a very badly brought up girl once lost a ribbon off a\r\nplait of black hair and somebody helped her to find it.”\r\n\r\n“Has the other person been well brought up?” asked Pump, with a faint\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Dalroy, staring at the sea. “He has been brought down.” Then,\r\nrousing himself again, he made a gesture toward a further part of the\r\nheath. “Do you know the remarkable history of that old wall, the one\r\nbeyond the last gorge over there?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the other, “unless you mean Dead Man’s Circus, and that\r\nhappened further along.”\r\n\r\n“I do not mean Dead Man’s Circus,” said the Captain. “The remarkable\r\nhistory of that wall is that somebody’s shadow once fell on it; and that\r\nshadow was more desirable than the substance of all other living things.\r\nIt is _this_,” he cried, almost violently, resuming his flippant tone,\r\n“it is this circumstance, Hump, and not the trivial and everyday\r\nincident of a dead man going to a circus to which you have presumed to\r\ncompare it, it is _this_ historical event which Lord Ivywood is about to\r\ncommemorate by rebuilding the wall with solid gold and Greek marbles\r\nstolen by the Turks from the grave of Socrates, enclosing a column of\r\nsolid gold four hundred feet high and surmounted by a colossal\r\nequestrian statue of a bankrupt Irishman riding backwards on a donkey.”\r\n\r\nHe lifted one of his long legs over the animal, as if about to pose for\r\nthe group; then swung back on both feet again, and again looked at the\r\npurple limit of the sea.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, Hump,” he said, “I think modern people have somehow got\r\ntheir minds all wrong about human life. They seem to expect what Nature\r\nhas never promised; and then try to ruin all that Nature has really\r\ngiven. At all those atheist chapels of Ivywood’s they’re always talking\r\nof Peace, Perfect Peace, and Utter Peace, and Universal Joy and souls\r\nthat beat as one. But they don’t look any more cheerful than anyone\r\nelse; and the next thing they do is to start smashing a thousand good\r\njokes and good stories and good songs and good friendships by pulling\r\ndown ‘The Old Ship.’” He gave a glance at the loose signpost lying on\r\nthe heath beside him, almost as if to reassure himself that it was not\r\nstolen. “Now it seems to me,” he went on, “that this is asking for too\r\nmuch and getting too little. I don’t know whether God means a man to\r\nhave happiness in that All in All and Utterly Utter sense of happiness.\r\nBut God does mean a man to have a little Fun; and I mean to go on having\r\nit. If I mustn’t satisfy my heart, I can gratify my humour. The cynical\r\nfellows who think themselves so damned clever have a sort of saying, ‘Be\r\ngood and you will be happy; but you will not have a jolly time.’ The\r\ncynical fellows are quite wrong, as they generally are. They have got\r\nhold of the exact opposite of the truth. God knows I don’t set up to be\r\ngood; but even a rascal sometimes has to fight the world in the same way\r\nas a saint. I think I have fought the world; _et militavi non\r\nsine_—what’s the Latin for having a lark? I can’t pretend to Peace and\r\nJoy, and all the rest of it, particularly in this original briar-patch.\r\nI haven’t been happy, Hump, but I have had a jolly time.”\r\n\r\nThe sunset stillness settled down again, save for the cropping of the\r\ndonkey in the undergrowth; and Pump said nothing sympathetically; and it\r\nwas Dalroy once more who took up his parable.\r\n\r\n“So I think there’s too much of this playing on our emotions, Hump; as\r\nthis place is certainly playing the cat and banjo with mine. Damn it\r\nall, there are other things to do with the rest of one’s life! I don’t\r\nlike all this fuss about feeling things—it only makes people miserable.\r\nIn my present frame of mind I’m in favour of doing things. All of which,\r\nHump,” he said with a sudden lift of the voice that always went in him\r\nwith a rushing, irrational return of merely animal spirits—“All of which\r\nI have put into a Song Against Songs, that I will now sing you.”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t sing it here,” said Humphrey Pump, picking up his gun and\r\nputting it under his arm. “You look large in this open place; and you\r\nsound large. But I’ll take you to the Hole in Heaven you’ve been talking\r\nabout so much, and hide you as I used to hide you from that tutor—I\r\ncouldn’t catch his name—man who could only get drunk on Greek wine at\r\nSquire Wimpole’s.”\r\n\r\n“Hump!” cried the Captain, “I abdicate the throne of Ithaca. You are far\r\nwiser than Ulysses. Here I have had my heart torn with temptations to\r\nten thousand things between suicide and abduction, and all by the mere\r\nsight of that hole in the heath, where we used to have picnics. And all\r\nthat time I’d forgotten we used to call it the Hole in Heaven. And, by\r\nGod, what a good name—in both senses.”\r\n\r\n“I thought you’d have remembered it, Captain,” said the innkeeper, “from\r\nthe joke young Mr. Matthews made.”\r\n\r\n“In the heat of some savage hand to hand struggle in Albania,” said Mr.\r\nDalroy, sadly, passing his palm across his brow, “I must have forgotten\r\nfor one fatal instant the joke young Mr. Matthews made.”\r\n\r\n“It wasn’t very good,” said Mr. Pump, simply. “Ah, his aunt was the one\r\nfor things like that. She went too far with old Gudgeon, though.”\r\n\r\nWith these words he jumped and seemed to be swallowed up by the earth.\r\nBut they had merely strolled the few yards needed to bring them to the\r\nedge of the sand-pit on the heath of which they had been speaking. And\r\nit is one of the truths concealed by Heaven from Lord Ivywood, and\r\nrevealed by Heaven to Mr. Pump, that a hiding-place can be covered when\r\nyou are close to it; and yet be open and visible from some spot of\r\nvantage far off. From the side by which they approached it, the sudden\r\nhollow of sand, a kind of collapsed chamber in the heath, seemed covered\r\nwith a natural curve of fern and furze, and flashed out of sight like a\r\nfairy.\r\n\r\n“It’s all right,” he called out from under a floor or roof of leaves.\r\n“You’ll remember it all when you get here. This is the place to sing\r\nyour song, Captain. Lord bless me, Captain, don’t I remember your\r\nsinging that Irish song you made up at college—bellowing it like a bull\r\nof Bashan—all about hearts and sleeves or some such things—and her\r\nladyship and the tutor never heard a breath, because that bank of sand\r\nbreaks everything. It’s worth knowing all this, you know. It’s a pity\r\nit’s not part of a young gentleman’s education. Now you shall sing me\r\nthe song in favour of having no feelings, or whatever you call it.”\r\n\r\nDalroy was staring about him at the cavern of his old picnics, so\r\nforgotten and so startlingly familiar. He seemed to have lost all\r\nthought of singing anything, and simply to be groping in the dark house\r\nof his own boyhood. There was a slight trickle from a natural spring in\r\nsandstone just under the ferns, and he remembered they used to try to\r\nboil the water in a kettle. He remembered a quarrel about who had upset\r\nthe kettle which, in the morbidity of first love, had given him for days\r\nthe tortures of the damned. When the energetic Pump broke once more\r\nthrough the rather thorny roof, on an impulse to accumulate their other\r\neccentric possessions, Patrick remembered about a thorn in a finger,\r\nthat made his heart stop with something that was pain and perfect music.\r\nWhen Pump returned with the rum-keg and the cheese and rolled them with\r\na kick down the shelving sandy side of the hole, he remembered, with\r\nalmost wrathful laughter, that in the old days he had rolled down that\r\nslope himself, and thought it a rather fine thing to do. He felt then as\r\nif he were rolling down a smooth side of the Matterhorn. He observed now\r\nthat the height was rather less than that of the second storey of one of\r\nthe stunted cottages he had noted on his return. He suddenly understood\r\nhe had grown bigger; bigger in a bodily sense. He had doubts about any\r\nother.\r\n\r\n“The Hole in Heaven!” he said. “What a good name! What a good poet I was\r\nin those days! The Hole in Heaven. But does it let one in, or let one\r\nout?”\r\n\r\nIn the last level shafts of the fallen sun the fantastic shadow of the\r\nlong-eared quadruped, whom Pump had now tethered to a new and nearer\r\npasture, fell across the last sunlit scrap of sand. Dalroy looked at the\r\nlong exaggerated shadow of the ass; and laughed that short explosive\r\nlaugh he had uttered when the doors of the harems had been closed after\r\nthe Turkish war. He was normally a man much too loquacious; but he never\r\nexplained those laughs.\r\n\r\nHumphrey Pump plunged down again into the sunken nest, and began to\r\nbroach the cask of rum in his own secret style, saying—\r\n\r\n“We can get something else somehow tomorrow. For tonight we can eat\r\ncheese and drink rum, especially as there’s water on tap, so to speak.\r\nAnd now, Captain, sing us the Song Against Songs.”\r\n\r\nPatrick Dalroy drank a little rum out of a small medicine glass which\r\nthe generally unaccountable Mr. Pump unaccountably produced from his\r\nwaistcoat pocket; but Patrick’s colour had risen, his brow was almost as\r\nred as his hair; and he was evidently reluctant.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see why I should sing all the songs,” he said. “Why the divil\r\ndon’t you sing a song yourself? And now I come to think of it,” he\r\ncried, with an accumulating brogue, not, perhaps, wholly unaffected by\r\nthe rum, which he had not, in fact, drunk for years, “and now I come to\r\nthink of it, what about that song of yours? All me youth’s coming back\r\nin this blest and cursed place; and I remember that song of yours, that\r\nnever existed nor ever will. Don’t ye remember now, Humphrey Pump, that\r\nnight when I sang ye no less than seventeen songs of me own\r\ncomposition?”\r\n\r\n“I remember it very well,” answered the Englishman, with restraint.\r\n\r\n“And don’t ye remember,” went on the exhilarated Irishman, with\r\nsolemnity, “that unless ye could produce a poetic lyric of your own,\r\nwritten and sung by yourself, I threatened to....”\r\n\r\n“To sing again,” said the impenetrable Pump. “Yes, I know.”\r\n\r\nHe calmly proceeded to take out of his pockets, which were, alas, more\r\nlike those of a poacher than an innkeeper, a folded and faded piece of\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n“I wrote it when you asked me,” he said simply. “I have never tried to\r\nsing it. But I’ll sing it myself, when you’ve sung your song, against\r\nanybody singing at all.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” cried the somewhat excited Captain, “to hear a song from\r\nyou—why, I’ll sing anything. This is the Song Against Songs, Hump.”\r\n\r\nAnd again he let his voice out like a bellow against the evening\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n “The song of the sorrow of Melisande is a weary song and a dreary song,\r\n    The glory of Mariana’s grange had got into great decay,\r\n  The song of the Raven Never More has never been called a cheery song,\r\n    And the brightest things in Baudelaire are anything else but gay.\r\n     But who will write us a riding song,\r\n     Or a hunting song or a drinking song,\r\n     Fit for them that arose and rode,\r\n     When day and the wine were red?\r\n     But bring me a quart of claret out,\r\n     And I will write you a clinking song,\r\n     A song of war and a song of wine,\r\n     And a song to wake the dead.\r\n\r\n “The song of the fury of Fragolette is a florid song and a torrid song,\r\n    The song of the sorrow of Tara is sung to a harp unstrung,\r\n  The song of the cheerful Shropshire Kid I consider a perfectly horrid\r\n     song,\r\n    And the song of the happy Futurist is a song that can’t be sung.\r\n     But who will write us a riding song,\r\n     Or a fighting song or a drinking song,\r\n     Fit for the fathers of you and me,\r\n     That knew how to think and thrive?\r\n     But the song of Beauty and Art and Love\r\n     Is simply an utterly stinking song,\r\n     To double you up and drag you down.\r\n     And damn your soul alive.”\r\n\r\n“Take some more rum,” concluded the Irish officer, affably, “and let’s\r\nhear your song at last.”\r\n\r\nWith the gravity inseparable from the deep conventionality of country\r\npeople, Mr. Pump unfolded the paper on which he had recorded the only\r\nantagonistic emotion that was strong enough in him to screw his infinite\r\nEnglish tolerance to the pitch of song. He read out the title very\r\ncarefully and in full.\r\n\r\n“Song Against Grocers, by Humphrey Pump, sole proprietor of ‘The Old\r\nShip,’ Pebblewick. Good Accommodation for Man and Beast. Celebrated as\r\nthe House at which both Queen Charlotte and Jonathan Wilde put up on\r\ndifferent occasions; and where the Ice-cream man was mistaken for\r\nBonaparte. This song is written against Grocers.”\r\n\r\n               “God made the wicked Grocer,\r\n                  For a mystery and a sign,\r\n                That men might shun the awful shops,\r\n                  And go to inns to dine;\r\n                Where the bacon’s on the rafter\r\n                  And the wine is in the wood,\r\n                And God that made good laughter\r\n                  Has seen that they are good.\r\n\r\n               “The evil-hearted Grocer\r\n                  Would call his mother ‘Ma’am,’\r\n                And bow at her and bob at her,\r\n                  Her aged soul to damn;\r\n                And rub his horrid hands and ask,\r\n                  What article was next;\r\n                Though _mortis in articulo_,\r\n                  Should be her proper text.\r\n\r\n               “His props are not his children\r\n                  But pert lads underpaid,\r\n                Who call out ‘Cash!’ and bang about,\r\n                  To work his wicked trade;\r\n                He keeps a lady in a cage,\r\n                  Most cruelly all day,\r\n                And makes her count and calls her ‘Miss,’\r\n                  Until she fades away.\r\n\r\n               “The righteous minds of inn-keepers\r\n                  Induce them now and then\r\n                To crack a bottle with a friend,\r\n                  Or treat unmoneyed men;\r\n                But who hath seen the Grocer\r\n                  Treat housemaids to his teas,\r\n                Or crack a bottle of fish-sauce,\r\n                  Or stand a man a cheese?\r\n\r\n               “He sells us sands of Araby\r\n                  As sugar for cash down,\r\n                He sweeps his shop and sells the dust,\r\n                  The purest salt in town;\r\n                He crams with cans of poisoned meat\r\n                  Poor subjects of the King,\r\n                And when they die by thousands\r\n                  Why, he laughs like anything.\r\n\r\n               “The Wicked Grocer groces\r\n                  In spirits and in wine,\r\n                Not frankly and in fellowship,\r\n                  As men in inns do dine;\r\n                But packed with soap and sardines\r\n                  And carried off by grooms,\r\n                For to be snatched by Duchesses,\r\n                  And drunk in dressing-rooms.\r\n\r\n               “The hell-instructed Grocer\r\n                  Has a temple made of tin,\r\n                And the ruin of good inn-keepers\r\n                  Is loudly urged therein;\r\n                But now the sands are running out\r\n                  From sugar of a sort,\r\n                The Grocer trembles; for his time\r\n                  Just like his weight is short.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Dalroy was getting considerably heated with his nautical liquor,\r\nand his appreciation of Pump’s song was not merely noisy but active. He\r\nleapt to his feet and waved his glass. “Ye ought to be Poet Laureate,\r\nHump—ye’re right, ye’re right; we’ll stand all this no longer!”\r\n\r\nHe dashed wildly up the sand slope and pointed with the sign-post\r\ntowards the darkening shore, where the low shed of corrugated iron stood\r\nalmost isolated.\r\n\r\n“There’s your tin temple!” he said. “Let’s burn it!”\r\n\r\nThey were some way along the coast from the large watering-place of\r\nPebblewick and between the gathering twilight and the rolling country it\r\ncould not be clearly seen. Nothing was now in sight but the corrugated\r\niron hall by the beach and three half-built red brick villas.\r\n\r\nDalroy appeared to regard the hall and the empty houses with great\r\nmalevolence.\r\n\r\n“Look at it!” he said. “Babylon!”\r\n\r\nHe brandished the inn-sign in the air like a banner, and began to stride\r\ntowards the place, showering curses.\r\n\r\n“In forty days,” he cried, “shall Pebblewick be destroyed. Dogs shall\r\nlap the blood of J. Leveson, Secretary, and Unicorns—”\r\n\r\n“Come back Pat,” cried Humphrey, “you’ve had too much rum.”\r\n\r\n“Lions shall howl in its high places,” vociferated the Captain.\r\n\r\n“Donkeys will howl, anyhow,” said Pump. “But I suppose the other donkey\r\nmust follow.”\r\n\r\nAnd loading and untethering the quadruped, he began to lead him along.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                      THE SOCIETY OF SIMPLE SOULS\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDER sunset, at once softer and more sombre, under which the leaden sea\r\ntook on a Lenten purple, a tint appropriate to tragedy, Lady Joan Brett\r\nwas once more drifting moodily along the sea-front. The evening had been\r\nrainy and lowering; the watering-place season was nearly over; and she\r\nwas almost alone on the shore; but she had fallen into the habit of\r\nrestlessly pacing the place, and it seemed to satisfy some subconscious\r\nhunger in her rather mixed psychology. Through all her brooding her\r\nanimal senses always remained abnormally active: she could _smell_ the\r\nsea when it had ebbed almost to the horizon, and in the same way she\r\nheard, through every whisper of waves or wind, the swish or flutter of\r\nanother woman’s skirt behind her. There is, she felt, something\r\nunmistakable about the movements of a lady who is generally very\r\ndignified and rather slow, and who happens to be in a hurry.\r\n\r\nShe turned to look at the lady who was thus hastening to overtake her;\r\nlifted her eyebrows a little and held out her hand. The interruption was\r\nknown to her as Lady Enid Wimpole, cousin of Lord Ivywood; a tall and\r\ngraceful lady who unbalanced her own elegance by a fashionable costume\r\nthat was at once funereal and fantastic; her fair hair was pale but\r\nplentiful; her face was not only handsome and fastidious in the aquiline\r\nstyle, but when considered seriously was sensitive, modest, and even\r\npathetic, but her wan blue eyes seemed slightly prominent, with that\r\nexpression of cold eagerness that is seen in the eyes of ladies who ask\r\nquestions at public meetings.\r\n\r\nJoan Brett was herself, as she had said, a connection of the Ivywood\r\nfamily; but Lady Enid was Ivywood’s first cousin, and for all practical\r\npurposes his sister. For she kept house for him and his mother, who was\r\nnow so incredibly old that she only survived to satisfy conventional\r\nopinion in the character of a speechless and useless _chaperon_. And\r\nIvywood was not the sort who would be likely to call out any activity in\r\nan old lady exercising that office. Nor, for that matter, was Lady Enid\r\nWimpole; there seemed to shine on her face the same kind of inhuman,\r\nabsent-minded common sense that shone on her cousin’s.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m so glad I’ve caught you up,” she said to Joan. “Lady Ivywood\r\nwants you _so_ much to come to us for the week-end or so, while Philip\r\nis still there. He always admired your sonnet on Cyprus so much, and he\r\nwants to talk to you about this policy of his in Turkey. Of course he’s\r\nawfully busy, but I shall be seeing him tonight after the meeting.”\r\n\r\n“No living creature,” said Lady Joan, with a smile, “ever saw him except\r\nbefore or after a meeting.”\r\n\r\n“Are you a Simple Soul?” asked Lady Enid, carelessly.\r\n\r\n“Am I a simple soul?” asked Joan, drawing her black brows together.\r\n“Merciful Heavens, no! What can you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Their meeting’s on tonight at the small Universal Hall, and Philip’s\r\ntaking the chair,” explained the other lady. “He’s very annoyed that he\r\nhas to leave early to get up to the House, but Mr. Leveson can take the\r\nchair for the last bit. They’ve got Misysra Ammon.”\r\n\r\n“Got Mrs. Who?” asked Joan, in honest doubt.\r\n\r\n“You make game of everything,” said Lady Enid, in cheerless amiability.\r\n“It’s the man everyone’s talking about—_you_ know as well as I do. It’s\r\nreally his influence that has _made_ the Simple Souls.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Lady Joan Brett.\r\n\r\nThen after a long silence, she added: “Who are the Simple Souls? I\r\nshould be interested in them, if I could meet any.” And she turned her\r\ndark, brooding face on the darkening purple sea.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say, my dear,” asked Lady Enid Wimpole, “that you\r\nhaven’t met any of them yet?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Joan, looking at the last dark line of sea. “I never met but\r\none simple soul in my life.”\r\n\r\n“But you must come to the meeting!” cried Lady Enid, with frosty and\r\nsparkling gaity. “You must come at once! Philip is certain to be\r\neloquent on a subject like this, and of course Misysra Ammon is _always_\r\nso wonderful.”\r\n\r\nWithout any very distinct idea of where she was going or why she was\r\ngoing there, Joan allowed herself to be piloted to a low lead or tin\r\nshed, beyond the last straggling hotels, out of the echoing shell of\r\nwhich she could prematurely hear a voice that she thought she\r\nrecognised. When she came in Lord Ivywood was on his feet, in exquisite\r\nevening dress, but with a light overcoat thrown over the seat behind\r\nhim. Beside him, in less tasteful but more obvious evening dress, was\r\nthe little old man she had heard on the beach.\r\n\r\nNo one else was on the platform, but just under it, rather to Joan’s\r\nsurprise, sat Miss Browning, her old typewriting friend in her old black\r\ndress, industriously taking down Lord Ivywood’s words in shorthand. A\r\nyard or two off, even more to her surprise, sat Miss Browning’s more\r\ndomestic sister, also taking down the same words in shorthand.\r\n\r\n“That is Misysra Ammon,” whispered Lady Enid, earnestly, pointing a\r\ndelicate finger at the little old man beside the chairman.\r\n\r\n“I know him,” said Joan. “Where’s the umbrella?”\r\n\r\n“... at least evident,” Lord Ivywood was saying, “that one of those\r\nancestral impossibilities is no longer impossible. The East and the West\r\nare one. The East is no longer East nor the West West; for a small\r\nisthmus has been broken, and the Atlantic and Pacific are a single sea.\r\nNo man assuredly has done more of this mighty work of unity than the\r\nbrilliant and distinguished philosopher to whom you will have the\r\npleasure of listening tonight; and I profoundly wish that affairs more\r\npractical, for I will not call them more important, did not prevent my\r\nremaining to enjoy his eloquence, as I have so often enjoyed it before.\r\nMr. Leveson has kindly consented to take my place, and I can do no more\r\nthan express my deep sympathy with the aims and ideals which will be\r\ndeveloped before you tonight. I have long been increasingly convinced\r\nthat underneath a certain mask of stiffness which the Mahomedan religion\r\nhas worn through certain centuries, as a somewhat similar mask has been\r\nworn by the religion of the Jews, Islam has in it the potentialities of\r\nbeing the most progressive of all religions; so that a century or two to\r\ncome we may see the cause of peace, of science and of reform everywhere\r\nsupported by Islam as it is everywhere supported by Israel. Not in vain,\r\nI think, is the symbol of that faith the Crescent, the growing thing.\r\nWhile other creeds carry emblems implying more or less of finality, for\r\nthis great creed of hope its very imperfection is its pride, and men\r\nshall walk fearlessly in new and wonderful paths, following the\r\nincreasing curve which contains and holds up before them the eternal\r\npromises of the orb.”\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of Lord Ivywood that, though he was really in a\r\nhurry, he sat down slowly and gravely amid the outburst of applause. The\r\nquiet resumption of the speaker’s seat, like the applause itself, was an\r\nartistic part of the peroration. When the last clap or stamp had\r\nsubsided, he sprang up alertly, his light great-coat over his arm, shook\r\nhands with the lecturer, bowed to the audience and slid quickly out of\r\nthe hall. Mr. Leveson, the swarthy young man with the drooping\r\ndouble-eyeglass rather bashfully to the front, took the empty seat on\r\nthe platform, and in a few words presented the eminent Turkish mystic\r\nMisysra Ammon, sometimes called the Prophet of the Moon.\r\n\r\nLady Joan found the Prophet’s English accent somewhat improved by good\r\nsociety, but he still elongated the letter “u” in the same bleating\r\nmanner, and his remarks had exactly the same rabidly wrong-headed\r\ningenuity as his lecture upon English inns. It appeared that he was\r\nspeaking on the higher Polygamy; but he began with a sort of general\r\ndefence of the Moslem civilisation, especially against the charge of\r\nsterility and worldly ineffectiveness.\r\n\r\n“It iss joost in the practical tings,” he was saying, “it iss joost in\r\nthe practical tings, if you could come to consider them in a manner\r\nquite equal, that our methods are better than your methods. My ancestors\r\ninvented the curved swords, because one cuts better with a curved sword.\r\nYour ancestors possessed the straight swords out of some romantic fancy\r\nof being what you call straight; or, I will take a more plain example,\r\nof which I have myself experience. When I first had the honour of\r\nmeeting Lord Ivywood, I was unused to your various ceremonies and had a\r\nlittle difficulty, joost a little difficulty, in entering Mr. Claridge’s\r\nhotel, where his lordship had invited me. A servant of the hotel was\r\nstanding joost beside me on the doorstep. I stoo-ooped down to take off\r\nmy boo-oots, and he asked me what I was dooing. I said to him: ‘My\r\nfriend, I am taking off my boo-oots.’”\r\n\r\nA smothered sound came from Lady Joan Brett, but the lecturer did not\r\nnotice it and went on with a beautiful simplicity.\r\n\r\n“I told him that in my country, when showing respect for any spot, we do\r\nnot take off our hats; we take off our boo-oots. And because I would\r\nkeep on my hat and take off my boo-oots, he suggested to me that I had\r\nbeen afflicted by Allah, in the head. Now was not that foony?”\r\n\r\n“Very,” said Lady Joan, inside her handkerchief, for she was choking\r\nwith laughter. Something like a faint smile passed over the earnest\r\nfaces of the two or three most intelligent of the Simple Souls, but for\r\nthe most part the Souls seemed very simple indeed, helpless looking\r\npeople with limp hair and gowns like green curtains, and their dry faces\r\nwere as dry as ever.\r\n\r\n“But I explained to him. I explained to him for a long time, for a\r\ncarefully occupied time, that it was more practical, more business-like,\r\nmore altogether for utility, to take off the boo-oots than to remove the\r\nhat. ‘Let us,’ I said to him ‘consider what many complaints are made\r\nagainst the footwear, what few complaints against the headwear. You\r\ncomplain if in your drawing-rooms is the marching about of muddy\r\nboo-oots. Are any of your drawing-rooms marked thus with the marching\r\nabout of muddy hats? How very many of your husbands kick you with the\r\nboo-oot! Yet how few of your husbands on any occasion butt you with the\r\nhat?’”\r\n\r\nHe looked round with a radiant seriousness, which made Lady Joan almost\r\nas speechless for sympathy as she was for amusement. With all that was\r\nmost sound in his too complicated soul she realized the presence of a\r\nman really convinced.\r\n\r\n“The man on the doorstep, he would not listen to me,” went on Misysra\r\nAmmon, pathetically. “He said there would be a crowd if I stood on the\r\ndoorstep, holding in my hand my boo-oots. Well, I do not know why, in\r\nyour country you always send the young males to be the first of your\r\ncrowds. They certainly were making a number of noises, the young males.”\r\n\r\nLady Joan Brett stood up suddenly and displayed enormous interest in the\r\nrest of the audience in the back parts of the hall. She felt that if she\r\nlooked for one moment more at the serious face with the Jewish nose and\r\nthe Persian beard, she would publicly disgrace herself; or, what was\r\nquite as bad (for she was the generous sort of aristocrat) publicly\r\ninsult the lecturer. She had a feeling that the sight of all the Simple\r\nSouls in bulk might have a soothing effect. It had. It had what might\r\nhave been mistaken for a depressing effect. Lady Joan resumed her seat\r\nwith a controlled countenance.\r\n\r\n“Now, why,” asked the Eastern philosopher, “do I tell so simple a little\r\nstory of your London streets—a thing happening any day? The little\r\nmistake had no preju-udicial effect. Lord Ivywood came out, at the end.\r\nHe made no attempt to explain the true view of so important matters to\r\nMr. Claridge’s servant, though Mr. Claridge’s servant remained on the\r\ndoorstep. But he commanded Mr. Claridge’s servant to restore to me one\r\nof my boo-oots, which had fallen down the front steps, while I was\r\nexplaining this harmlessness of the hat in the home. So all was, for me,\r\nvery well. But why do I tell such little tales?”\r\n\r\nHe spread out his hands again, in his fanlike eastern style. Then he\r\nclapped them together, so suddenly that Joan jumped, and looked\r\ninstinctively for the entrance of five hundred negro slaves, laden with\r\njewels. But it was only his emphatic gesture of eloquence. He went on\r\nwith an excited thickening of the accent.\r\n\r\n“Because, my friends, this is the best example I could give of the wrong\r\nand slanderous character of the charge that we fail in our\r\ndomesticities. That we fail especially in our treatment of the\r\nwomenkind. I appeal to any lady, to any Christian lady. Is not the\r\nboo-oot more devastating, more dreaded in the home than the hat? The\r\nboot jumps, he bound, he run about, he break things, he leave on the\r\ncarpet the earths of the garden. The hat, he remain quiet on his\r\nhat-peg. Look at him on his hat-peg; how quiet and good he remain! Why\r\nnot let him remain quiet also on his head?”\r\n\r\nLady Joan applauded warmly, as did several other ladies, and the sage\r\nwent on, encouraged.\r\n\r\n“Can you not therefore trust, dear ladies, this great religion to\r\nunderstand you concerning other things, as it understands you regarding\r\nboo-oots? What is the common objection our worthy enemies make against\r\nour polygamy? That it is disdainful of the womanhood. But how can this\r\nbe so, my friends, when it allows the womanhood to be present in so\r\nlarge numbers? When in your House of Commons you put a hundred English\r\nmembers and joost one little Welsh member, you do not say ‘The Welshman\r\nis on top; he is our Sultan; may he live for ever!’ If your jury\r\ncontained eleven great large ladies and one leetle man you would not say\r\n‘this is unfair to the great large ladies.’ Why should you shrink, then,\r\nladies, from this great polygamical experiment which Lord Ivywood\r\nhimself—”\r\n\r\nJoan’s dark eyes were still fixed on the wrinkled, patient face of the\r\nlecturer, but every word of the rest of the lecture was lost to her.\r\nUnder her glowing Spanish tint she had turned pale with extraordinary\r\nemotions, but she did not stir a hair.\r\n\r\nThe door of the hall stood open, and occasional sounds came even from\r\nthat deserted end of the town. Two men seemed to be passing along the\r\ndistant parade; one of them was singing. It was common enough for\r\nworkmen to sing going home at night, and the voice, though a loud one,\r\nwould have been too far off for Joan to hear the words. Only Joan\r\nhappened to know the words. She could almost see them before her,\r\nwritten in a round swaggering hand on the pink page of an old\r\nschool-girl album at home. She knew the words and the voice.\r\n\r\n      “I come from Castlepatrick and my heart is on my sleeve,\r\n       And any sword or pistol boy can hit ut with me leave,\r\n       It shines there for an epaulette, as golden as a flame,\r\n       As naked as me ancestors, as noble as me name.\r\n       For I come from Castlepatrick and my heart is on my sleeve,\r\n       But a lady stole it from me on St. Gallowglass’s Eve.”\r\n\r\nStartlingly and with strong pain there sprang up before Joan’s eyes a\r\npatch of broken heath with a very deep hollow of white sand, blinding in\r\nthe sun. No words, no name, only the place.\r\n\r\n “The folks that live in Liverpool, their heart is in their boots;\r\n  They go to Hell like lambs, they do, because the hooter hoots.\r\n  Where men may not be dancin’, though the wheels may dance all day;\r\n  And men may not be smokin’, but only chimneys may.\r\n  But I come from Castlepatrick and my heart is on my sleeve,\r\n  But a lady stole it from me on St. Poleyander’s Eve.\r\n\r\n “The folks that live in black Belfast, their heart is in their mouth;\r\n  They see us making murders in the meadows of the South;\r\n  They think a plough’s a rack they do, and cattle-calls are creeds,\r\n  And they think we’re burnin’ witches when we’re only burnin’ weeds.\r\n  But I come from Castlepatrick, and me heart is on me sleeve;\r\n  But a lady stole it from me on St. Barnabas’s Eve.”\r\n\r\nThe voice had stopped suddenly, but the last lines were so much more\r\ndistinct that it was certain the singer had come nearer, and was not\r\nmarching away.\r\n\r\nIt was only after all this, and through a sort of cloud, that Lady Joan\r\nheard the indomitable Oriental bringing his whole eloquent address to a\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n“... And if you do not refu-use the sun that returns and rises in the\r\nEast with every morning, you will not refu-use either this great social\r\nexperiment, this great polygamical method which also arose out of the\r\nEast, and always returns. For this is that Higher Polygamy which always\r\ncomes, like the sun itself, out of the orient, but is only at its\r\nnoontide splendour when the sun is high in heaven.”\r\n\r\nShe was but vaguely conscious of Mr. Leveson, the man with the dark face\r\nand the eyeglasses, acknowledging the entrancing lecture in suitable\r\nterms, and calling on any of the Simple Souls who might have questions\r\nto ask, to ask them. It was only when the Simple Souls had displayed\r\ntheir simplicity with the usual parade of well-bred reluctance and fussy\r\nself-effacement, that anyone addressed the chair. And it was only after\r\nsomebody had been addressing the chair for some time that Joan gradually\r\nawoke to the fact that the address was somewhat unusual.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                           VOX POPULI VOX DEI\r\n\r\n\r\n“I AM SURE,” Mr. Leveson, the Secretary, had said, with a somewhat\r\nconstrained smile, “that after the eloquent and epoch-making speech to\r\nwhich we have listened there will be some questions asked, and we hope\r\nto have a debate afterwards. I am sure somebody will ask a question.”\r\nThen he looked interrogatively at one weary looking gentleman in the\r\nfourth row and said, “Mr. Hinch?”\r\n\r\nMr. Hinch shook his head with a pallid passion of refusal, wonderful to\r\nwatch, and said, “I couldn’t! I really couldn’t!”\r\n\r\n“We should be very pleased,” said Mr. Leveson, “if any lady would ask a\r\nquestion.”\r\n\r\nIn the silence that followed it was somehow psychologically borne in on\r\nthe whole audience that one particular great large lady (as the lecturer\r\nwould say) sitting at the end of the second row was expected to ask a\r\nquestion. Her own wax-work immobility was witness both to the\r\nexpectation and its disappointment. “Are there any other questions?”\r\nasked Mr. Leveson—as if there had been any yet. He seemed to speak with\r\na slight air of relief.\r\n\r\nThere was a sort of stir at the back of the hall and half way down one\r\nside of it. Choked whispers could be heard of “Now then, Garge!”—“Go it\r\nGarge! Is there any questions! Gor!”\r\n\r\nMr. Leveson looked up with an alertness somewhat akin to alarm. He\r\nrealised for the first time that a few quite common men in coarse,\r\nunclean clothes, had somehow strolled in through the open door. They\r\nwere not true rustics, but the semi-rustic labourers that linger about\r\nthe limits of the large watering-places. There was no “Mr.” among them.\r\nThere was a general tendency to call everybody George.\r\n\r\nMr. Leveson saw the situation and yielded to it. He modelled himself on\r\nLord Ivywood and did much what he would have done in all cases, but with\r\na timidity Lord Ivywood would not have shown. And the same social\r\ntraining that made him ashamed to be with such men, made him ashamed to\r\nown his shame. The same modern spirit that taught him to loathe such\r\nrags, also taught him to lie about his loathing.\r\n\r\n“I am sure we should be very glad,” he said, nervously, “if any friends\r\nfrom outside care to join in our inquiry. Of course, we’re all\r\nDemocrats,” and he looked round at the grand ladies with a ghastly\r\nsmile, “and believe in the Voice of the People and so on. If our friend\r\nat the back of the hall will put his question briefly, we need not\r\ninsist, I think, on his putting it in writing?”\r\n\r\nThere were renewed hoarse encouragements to George (that rightly\r\nchristened champion) and he wavered forward on legs tied in the middle\r\nwith string. He did not appear to have had any seat since his arrival,\r\nand made his remarks standing half way down what we may call the central\r\naisle.\r\n\r\n“Well, I want to ask the proprietor,” he began.\r\n\r\n“Questions,” said Mr. Leveson, swiftly seizing a chance for that\r\nconstruction of debate which is the main business of a modern chairman,\r\n“must be asked of the chair, if they are points of order. If they\r\nconcern the address, they should be asked of the lecturer.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I ask the lecturer,” said the patient Garge, “whether it ain’t\r\nright that when you ’ave the thing outside you should ’ave the thing\r\ninside.” (Hoarse applause at the back.)\r\n\r\nMr. Leveson was evidently puzzled and already suspicious that something\r\nwas quite wrong. But the enthusiasm of the Prophet of the Moon sprang up\r\ninstantly at any sort of question and swept the Chairman along with it.\r\n\r\n“But it iss the essence of our who-ole message,” he cried, spreading out\r\nhis arms to embrace the world, “that the outer manifestation should be\r\none with the inner manifestation. My friendss, it iss this very tru-uth\r\nour friend has stated, that iss responsible for our apparent lack of\r\nsymbolism in Islam! We appear to neglect the symbol because we insist on\r\nthe satisfactory symbol. My friend in the middle will walk round all our\r\nmosques and say loudly, ‘Where is the statue of Allah?’ But can my\r\nfriend in the middle really execute a complete and generally approved\r\nstatue of Allah?”\r\n\r\nMisysra Ammon sat down greatly satisfied with his answer, but it was\r\ndoubted by many whether he had conveyed the satisfaction to his friend\r\nin the middle. That seeker after truth wiped his mouth with the back of\r\nhis hand with an unsatisfied air and said:\r\n\r\n“No offence, sir. But ain’t it the Law, sir, that if you ’ave that\r\noutside we’re all right? I came in ’ere as natural as could be. But\r\nGorlumme, I never see a place like this afore.” (Hoarse laughter\r\nbehind.)\r\n\r\n“No apology is needed, my friend,” cried the Eastern sage, eagerly, “I\r\ncan conceive you are not perhaps du-uly conversant with such schools of\r\ntruth. But the Law is All. The Law is Allah. The inmost u-unity of—”\r\n\r\n“Well, ain’t it the Law?” repeated the dogged George, and every time he\r\nmentioned the Law the poor men who are its chief victims applauded\r\nloudly. “I’m not one to make a fuss. I never was one to make a fuss. I’m\r\na law-abidin’ man, I am. (More applause.) Ain’t it the Law that if so be\r\nsuch is your sign and such is your profession, you ought to serve us?”\r\n\r\n“I fear I not quite follow,” cried the eager Turk. “I ought?”\r\n\r\n“To serve us,” shouted a throng of thick voices from the back of the\r\nhall, which was already much more crowded than before.\r\n\r\n“Serve you!” cried Misysra, leaping up like a spring released, “The Holy\r\nProphet came from Heaven to serve you! The virtue and valour of a\r\nthousand years, my friends, has had no hunger but to serve you! We are\r\nof all faiths, the most the faith of service. Our highest prophet is no\r\nmore than the servant of God, as I am, as you all are. Even for our\r\nsymbol we choose a satellite, and honour the Moon because it only serves\r\nthe Earth, and does not pretend to be the Sun.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure,” cried Mr. Leveson, jumping up with a tactful grin, “that the\r\nlecturer has answered this last point in a most eloquent and effective\r\nway, and the motor cars are waiting for some of the ladies who have come\r\nfrom some distance, and I really think the proceedings—”\r\n\r\nAll the artistic ladies were already getting on their wraps, with faces\r\nvarying from bewilderment to blank terror. Only Lady Joan lingered,\r\ntrembling with unexplained excitement. The hitherto speechless Hinch had\r\nslid up to the Chairman’s seat and whispered to him:\r\n\r\n“You must get all the ladies away. I can’t imagine what’s up, but\r\nsomething’s up.”\r\n\r\n“Well?” repeated the patient George. “So be it’s the Law, where is it?”\r\n\r\n“Ladies and Gentlemen,” said Mr. Leveson, in his most ingratiating\r\nmanner, “I think we have had a most delightful evening, and—”\r\n\r\n“No, we ain’t,” cried a new and nastier voice from a corner of the room.\r\n“Where is it?”\r\n\r\n“That’s what we got a right to know,” said the law-abiding George.\r\n“Where is it?”\r\n\r\n“Where is what?” cried the nearly demented secretary in the chair. “What\r\ndo you want?”\r\n\r\nThe law-abiding Mr. George made a half turn and a gesture towards the\r\nman in the corner and said:\r\n\r\n“What’s yours, Jim?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll ’ave a drop of Scotch,” said the man in the corner.\r\n\r\nLady Enid Wimpole, who had lingered a little in loyalty to Joan, the\r\nonly other lady still left, caught both her wrists and cried in a\r\nthrilling whisper,\r\n\r\n“Oh, we must go to the car, dear! They’re using the most awful\r\nlanguage!”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAway on the wettest edge of the sands by the sea the prints of two\r\nwheels and four hoofs were being slowly washed away by a slowly rising\r\ntide; which was, indeed, the only motive of the man Humphrey Pump,\r\nleading the donkey cart, in leading it almost ankle deep in water.\r\n\r\n“I hope you’re sober again now,” he said with some seriousness to his\r\ncompanion, a huge man walking heavily and even humbly with a straight\r\nsword swinging to and fro at his hip—“for honestly it was a mug’s game\r\nto go and stick up the old sign before that tin place. I haven’t often\r\nspoken to you like this, Captain, but I don’t believe any other man in\r\nthe county could get you out of the hole as I can. But to go down there\r\nand frighten the ladies—why there’s been nothing so silly here since\r\nBishop’s Folly. You could hear the ladies screaming before we left.”\r\n\r\n“I heard worse than that long before we left,” said the large man,\r\nwithout lifting his head. “I heard one of them laugh.... Christ, do you\r\nthink I shouldn’t hear her laugh?”\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. “I didn’t mean to speak sharp,” said Humphrey Pump\r\nwith that incorruptible kindliness which was the root of his Englishry,\r\nand may yet save the soul of the English. “But it’s the truth I was\r\npretty well bothered about how to get out of this business. You’re\r\nbraver than I am, you see, and I own I was frightened about both of us.\r\nIf I hadn’t known my way to the lost tunnel, I should be fairly\r\nfrightened still.”\r\n\r\n“Known your way to what?” asked the Captain, lifting his red head for\r\nthe first time.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you know all about No More Ivywood’s lost tunnel,” said Pump,\r\ncarelessly. “Why, we all used to look for it when we were boys. Only I\r\nhappened to find it.”\r\n\r\n“Have mercy on an exile,” said Dalroy, humbly. “I don’t know which hurt\r\nhim most, the things he forgets or the things he remembers.”\r\n\r\nMr. Pump was silent for a little while and then said, more seriously\r\nthan usual, “Well, the people from London say you must put up placards\r\nand statues and subscriptions and epitaphs and the Lord knows what, to\r\nthe people who’ve found some new trick and made it come off. But only a\r\nman that knows his own land for forty miles round, knows what a lot of\r\npeople, and clever people too, there were who found new tricks, and had\r\nto hide them because they didn’t come off. There was Dr. Boone, up by\r\nGill-in-Hugby, who held out against Dr. Collison and the vaccination.\r\nHis treatment saved sixty patients who had got small-pox; and Dr.\r\nCollison’s killed ninety-two patients who hadn’t got anything. But Boone\r\nhad to keep it dark; naturally, because all his lady patients grew\r\nmustaches. It was a result of the treatment. But it wasn’t a result he\r\nwishes to dwell on. Then there was old Dean Arthur, who discovered\r\nballoons if ever a man did. He discovered them long before they were\r\ndiscovered. But people were suspicious about such things just then—there\r\nwas a revival of the witch business in spite of all the parsons—and he\r\nhad to sign a paper saying where he’d got the notion. Well, it stands to\r\nreason, you wouldn’t like to sign a paper saying you’d got it from the\r\nvillage idiot when you were both blowing soap-bubbles; and that’s all he\r\ncould have signed, for he was an honest gentleman, the poor old Dean.\r\nThen there was Jack Arlingham and the diving bell—but you remember all\r\nabout that. Well, it was just the same with the man that made this\r\ntunnel—one of the mad Ivywoods. There’s many a man, Captain, that has a\r\nstatue in the great London squares for helping to make the\r\nrailway-trains. There’s many a man has his name in Westminster Abbey for\r\ndoing something in discovering steamboats. Poor old Ivywood discovered\r\nboth at once; and had to be put under control. He had a notion that a\r\nrailway train might be made to rush right into the sea and turn into a\r\nsteamboat; and it seemed all right, according as he worked it out. But\r\nhis family were so ashamed of the thing, that they didn’t like the\r\ntunnel even mentioned. I don’t think anybody knows where it is but me\r\nand Bunchy Robinson. We shall be there in a minute or two. They’ve\r\nthrown the rocks about at this end; and let the thick plantation grow at\r\nthe other, but I’ve got a race horse through before now, to save it from\r\nColonel Chepstow’s little games, and I think I can manage this donkey.\r\nHonestly, I think it’s the only place we’ll be safe in after what we’ve\r\nleft behind us at Pebblewick. But it’s the best place in the world,\r\nthere’s no doubt, for lying low and starting afresh. Here we are. You\r\nthink you can’t get behind that rock, but you can. In fact, you have.”\r\n\r\nDalroy found himself, with some bewilderment, round the corner of a rock\r\nand in a long bore or barrel of blackness that ended in a very dim spot\r\nof green. Hearing the hoofs of the ass and the feet of his friend behind\r\nhim, he turned his head, but could see nothing but the pitch darkness of\r\na closed coal cellar. He turned again to the dim green speck, and\r\nmarching forward was glad to see it grow larger and brighter, like a big\r\nemerald, till he came out on a throng of trees, mostly thin, but growing\r\nso thickly and so close to the cavernous entrance of the tunnel that it\r\nwas quite clear the place was meant to be choked up by forests and\r\nforgotten. The light that came glimmering through the trees was so\r\nbroken and tremulous that it was hard to tell whether it was daybreak or\r\nmoonrise.\r\n\r\n“I know there’s water here,” said Pump. “They couldn’t keep it out of\r\nthe stone-work when they made the tunnel, and old Ivywood hit the\r\nhydraulic engineer with a spirit level. With the bit of covert here and\r\nthe sea behind us we ought to be able to get food of one kind or\r\nanother, when the cheese has given out, and donkeys can eat anything. By\r\nthe way,” he added with some embarrassment, “you don’t mind my saying\r\nit, Captain, but I think we’d better keep that rum for rare occasions.\r\nIt’s the best rum in England, and may be the last, if these mad games\r\nare going on. It’ll do us good to feel it’s there, so we can have it\r\nwhen we want it. The cask’s still nearly full.”\r\n\r\nDalroy put out his hand and shook the other’s. “Hump,” he said,\r\nseriously, “you’re right. It’s a sacred trust for Humanity; and we’ll\r\nonly drink it ourselves to celebrate great victories. In token of which\r\nI will take a glass now, to celebrate our glorious victory over Leveson\r\nand his tin tabernacle.”\r\n\r\nHe drained one glass and then sat down on the cask, as if to put\r\ntemptation behind him. His blue ruminant bull’s eye seemed to plunge\r\ndeeper and deeper into the emerald twilight of the trees in front of\r\nhim, and it was long before he spoke again.\r\n\r\nAt last he observed, “I think you said, Hump, that a friend of yours—a\r\ngentleman named Bunchy Robinson, I think—was also a _habitué_ here.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he knew the way,” answered Pump, leading the donkey to the most\r\nsuitable patch of pasturage.\r\n\r\n“May we, do you think, have the pleasure of a visit from Mr. Robinson?”\r\ninquired the Captain.\r\n\r\n“Not unless they’re jolly careless up in Blackstone Gaol,” replied Pump.\r\nAnd he moved the cheese well into the arch of the tunnel. Dalroy still\r\nsat with his square chin on his hand, staring at the mystery of the\r\nlittle wood.\r\n\r\n“You seem absent-minded, Captain,” remarked Humphrey.\r\n\r\n“The deepest thoughts are all commonplaces,” said Dalroy. “That is why I\r\nbelieve in Democracy, which is more than you do, you foul blood-stained\r\nold British Tory. And the deepest commonplace of all is that Vanitas\r\nVanitatem, which is not pessimism but is really the opposite of\r\npessimism. It is man’s futility that makes us feel he must be a god. And\r\nI think of this tunnel, and how the poor old lunatic walked about on\r\nthis grass, watching it being built, the soul in him on fire with the\r\nfuture. And he saw the whole world changed and the seas thronged with\r\nhis new shipping; and now,” and Dalroy’s voice changed and broke, “now\r\nthere is good pasture for the donkey and it is very quiet here.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Pump, in some way that conveyed his knowledge that the\r\nCaptain was thinking of other things also. The Captain went on dreamily:\r\n\r\n“And I think about another Lord Ivywood recorded in history who also had\r\na great vision. For it is a great vision after all, and though the man\r\nis a prig, he is brave. He also wants to drive a tunnel—between East and\r\nWest—to make the Indian Empire more British; to effect what he calls the\r\norientation of England, and I call the ruin of Christendom. And I am\r\nwondering just now whether the clear intellect and courageous will of a\r\nmadman will be strong enough to burst and drive that tunnel, as\r\neverything seems to show at this moment that it will. Or whether there\r\nbe indeed enough life and growth in your England to leave it at last as\r\nthis is left, buried in English forests and wasted by an English sea.”\r\n\r\nThe silence fell between them again, and again there was only the slight\r\nsound the animal made in eating. As Dalroy had said, it was very quiet\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nBut it was not quiet in Pebblewick that night; when the Riot Act was\r\nread, and all the people who had seen the sign-board outside fought all\r\nthe people who hadn’t seen the sign-board outside; or when babies and\r\nscientists next morning, seeking for shells and other common objects of\r\nthe sea-shore, found that their study included fragments of the outer\r\nclothing of Leveson and scraps of corrugated iron.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                   THE HIGHER CRITICISM AND MR. HIBBS\r\n\r\n\r\nPEBBLEWICK boasted an enterprising evening paper of its own, called “The\r\nPebblewick Globe,” and it was the great vaunt of the editor’s life that\r\nhe had got out an edition announcing the mystery of the vanishing\r\nsign-board, almost simultaneously with its vanishing. In the rows that\r\nfollowed sandwich men found no little protection from the blows\r\nindiscriminately given them behind and before, in the large wooden\r\nboards they carried inscribed:\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE VANISHING PUB\r\n                        PEBBLEWICK’S FAIRY TALE\r\n                                SPECIAL\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the paper contained a categorical and mainly correct account of what\r\nhad happened, or what seemed to have happened, to the eyes of the amazed\r\nGarge and his crowd of sympathisers. “George Burn, carpenter of this\r\ntown, with Samuel Gripes, drayman in the service of Messrs. Jay and\r\nGubbins, brewers, together with a number of other well-known residents,\r\npassed by the new building erected on the West Beach for various forms\r\nof entertainment and popularly called the small Universal Hall. Seeing\r\noutside it one of the old inn-signs now so rare, they drew the quite\r\nproper inference that the place retained the license to sell alcoholic\r\nliquors, which so many other places in this neighborhood have recently\r\nlost. The persons inside, however, appear to have denied all knowledge\r\nof the fact, and when the party (after some regrettable scenes in which\r\nno life was lost) came out on the beach again, it was found that the\r\ninn-sign had been destroyed or stolen. All parties were quite sober, and\r\nhad indeed obtained no opportunity to be anything else. The mystery is\r\nunderlying inquiry.”\r\n\r\nBut this comparatively realistic record was local and spontaneous, and\r\nowed not a little to the accidental honesty of the editor. Moreover,\r\nevening papers are often more honest than morning papers, because they\r\nare written by ill-paid and hardworked underlings in a great hurry, and\r\nthere is no time for more timid people to correct them. By the time the\r\nmorning papers came out next day a faint but perceptible change had\r\npassed over the story of the vanishing sign-board. In the daily paper\r\nwhich had the largest circulation and the most influence in that part of\r\nthe world, the problem was committed to a gentleman known by what seemed\r\nto the non-journalistic world the singular name of Hibbs However. It had\r\nbeen affixed to him in jest in connection with the almost complicated\r\ncaution with which all his public criticisms were qualified at every\r\nturn; so that everything came to depend upon the conjunctions; upon\r\n“but” and “yet” and “though” and similar words. As his salary grew\r\nlarger (for editors and proprietors like that sort of thing) and his old\r\nfriends fewer (for the most generous of friends cannot but feel faintly\r\nacid at a success which has in it nothing of the infectious flavour of\r\nglory) he grew more and more to value himself as a diplomatist; a man\r\nwho always said the right thing. But he was not without his intellectual\r\nnemesis; for at last he became so very diplomatic as to be darkly and\r\ndensely unintelligible. People who knew him had no difficulty in\r\nbelieving that what he had said was the right thing, the tactful thing,\r\nthe thing that should save the situation; but they had great difficulty\r\nin discovering what it was. In his early days he had had a great talent\r\nfor one of the worst tricks of modern journalism, the trick of\r\ndismissing the important part of a question as if it could wait, and\r\nappearing to get to business on the unimportant part of it. Thus, he\r\nwould say, “Whatever we may think of the rights and wrongs of the\r\nvivisection of pauper children, we shall all agree that it should only\r\nbe done, in any event, by fully qualified practitioners.” But in the\r\nlater and darker days of his diplomacy, he seemed rather to dismiss the\r\nimportant part of a subject, and get to grips with some totally\r\ndifferent subject, following some timid and elusive train of\r\nassociations of his own. In his late bad manner, as they say of\r\npainters, he was just as likely to say, “Whatever we may think of the\r\nrights and wrongs of the vivisection of pauper children, no progressive\r\nmind can doubt that the influence of the Vatican is on the decline.” His\r\nnickname had stuck to him in honour of a paragraph he was alleged to\r\nhave written when the American President was wounded by a bullet fired\r\nby a lunatic in New Orleans, and which was said to have run, “The\r\nPresident passed a good night and his condition is greatly improved. The\r\nassassin is not, however, a German, as was at first supposed.” Men\r\nstared at that mysterious conjunction till they wanted to go mad and to\r\nshoot somebody themselves.\r\n\r\nHibbs However was a long, lank man, with straight, yellowish hair and a\r\nmanner that was externally soft and mild but secretly supercilious. He\r\nhad been, when at Cambridge, a friend of Leveson, and they had both\r\nprided themselves on being moderate politicians. But if you have had\r\nyour hat smashed over your nose by one who has very recently described\r\nhimself as a “law-abidin’ man,” and if you have had to run for your life\r\nwith one coat-tail, and encouraged to further bodily activity by having\r\nirregular pieces of a corrugated iron roof thrown after you by men more\r\nenergetic than yourself, you will find you emerge with emotions which\r\nare not solely those of a moderate politician. Hibbs However had already\r\ncomposed a leaderette on the Pebblewick incident, which rather pointed\r\nto the truth of the story, so far as his articles ever pointed to\r\nanything. His motives for veering vaguely in this direction were, as\r\nusual, complex. He knew the millionaire who owned the paper had a hobby\r\nof Spiritualism, and something might always come out of not suppressing\r\na marvellous story. He knew that two at least of the prosperous artisans\r\nor small tradesmen who had attested the tale were staunch supporters of\r\nThe Party. He knew that Lord Ivywood must be mildly but not effectually\r\nchecked; for Lord Ivywood was of The Other Party. And there could be no\r\nmilder or less effectual way of checking him than by allowing the paper\r\nto lend at least a temporary credit to a well-supported story that came\r\nfrom outside, and certainly had not been (like so many stories) created\r\nin the office. Amid all these considerations had Hibbs However steered\r\nhis way to a more or less confirmatory article, when the sudden\r\napparition of J. Leveson, Secretary, in the sub-editor’s room with a\r\nburst collar and broken eye-glasses, led Mr. Hibbs into a long, private\r\nconversation with him and a comparative reversal of his plans. But of\r\ncourse he did not write a new article; he was not of that divine order\r\nwho make all things new. He chopped and changed his original article in\r\nsuch a way that it was something quite beyond the most bewildering\r\narticle he had written in the past; and is still prized by those highly\r\ncultured persons who collect the worst literature of the world.\r\n\r\nIt began, indeed, with the comparatively familiar formula, “Whether we\r\ntake the more lax or the more advanced view of the old disputed problem\r\nof the morality or immorality of the wooden sign-board as such, we shall\r\nall agree that the scenes enacted at Pebblewick were very discreditable,\r\nto most, though not all, concerned.” After that, tact degenerated into a\r\nriot of irrelevance. It was a wonderful article. The reader could get\r\nfrom it a faint glimpse of Mr. Hibbs’s opinion on almost every other\r\nsubject except the subject of the article. The first half of the next\r\nsentence made it quite clear that Mr. Hibbs (had he been present) would\r\nnot have lent his active assistance to the Massacre of St. Bartholomew\r\nor the Massacres of September. But the second half of the sentence\r\nsuggested with equal clearness that, since these two acts were no\r\nlonger, as it were, in contemplation, and all attempts to prevent them\r\nwould probably arrive a little late, he felt the warmest friendship for\r\nthe French nation. He merely insisted that his friendship should never\r\nbe mentioned except in the French language. It must be called an\r\n“entente” in the language taught to tourists by waiters. It must on no\r\naccount be called an “understanding,” in a language understanded of the\r\npeople. From the first half of the sentence following it might safely be\r\ninferred that Mr. Hibbs had read Milton, or at least the passage about\r\nsons of Belial; from the second half that he knew nothing about bad\r\nwine, let alone good. The next sentence began with the corruption of the\r\nRoman Empire and contrived to end with Dr. Clifford. Then there was a\r\nweak plea for Eugenics; and a warm plea against Conscription, which was\r\nnot True Eugenics. That was all; and it was headed “The Riot at\r\nPebblewick.”\r\n\r\nYet some injustice would be done to Hibbs However if we concealed the\r\nfact that this chaotic leader was followed by quite a considerable mass\r\nof public correspondence. The people who write to newspapers are, it may\r\nbe supposed, a small, eccentric body, like most of those that sway a\r\nmodern state. But at least, unlike the lawyers, or the financiers, or\r\nthe members of Parliament, or the men of science, they are people of all\r\nkinds scattered all over the country, of all classes, counties, ages,\r\nsects, sexes, and stages of insanity. The letters that followed Hibbs’s\r\narticle are still worth looking up in the dusty old files of his paper.\r\n\r\nA dear old lady in the densest part of the Midlands wrote to suggest\r\nthat there might really have been an old ship wrecked on the shore,\r\nduring the proceedings. “Mr. Leveson may have omitted to notice it, or,\r\nat that late hour of the evening, it may have been mistaken for a\r\nsign-board, especially by a person of defective sight. My own sight has\r\nbeen failing for some time; but I am still a diligent reader of your\r\npaper.” If Mr. Hibbs’s diplomacy had left one nerve in his soul\r\nundrugged, he would have laughed, or burst into tears, or got drunk, or\r\ngone into a monastery over a letter like that. As it was, he measured it\r\nwith a pencil, and decided that it was just too long to get into the\r\ncolumn.\r\n\r\nThen there was a letter from a theorist, and a theorist of the worst\r\nsort. There is no great harm in the theorist who makes up a new theory\r\nto fit a new event. But the theorist who starts with a false theory and\r\nthen sees everything as making it come true is the most dangerous enemy\r\nof human reason. The letter began like a bullet let loose by the\r\ntrigger. “Is not the whole question met by Ex. iv. 3? I enclose\r\npamphlets in which I have proved the point quite plainly, and which none\r\nof the Bishops or the so-called Free Church Ministers have attempted to\r\nanswer. The connection between the rod or pole and the snake so clearly\r\nindicated in Scripture is no less clear in this case. It is well known\r\nthat those who follow after strong drink often announce themselves as\r\nhaving seen a snake. Is it not clear that those unhappy revellers beheld\r\nit in its transformed state as a pole; see also Deut. xviii. 2. If our\r\nso-called religious leaders,” etc. The letter went on for thirty-three\r\npages and Hibbs was perhaps justified in this case in thinking the\r\nletter rather too long.\r\n\r\nThen there was the scientific correspondent who said—Might it not be due\r\nto the acoustic qualities of the hall? He had never believed in the\r\ncorrugated iron hall. The very word “hall” itself (he added playfully)\r\nwas often so sharpened and shortened by the abrupt echoes of those\r\nrepeated metallic curves, that it had every appearance of being the word\r\n“hell,” and had caused many theological entanglements, and some police\r\nprosecutions. In the light of these facts, he wished to draw the\r\neditor’s attention to some very curious details about this supposed\r\npresence or absence of an inn-sign. It would be noted that many of the\r\nwitnesses, and especially the most respectable of them, constantly refer\r\nto something that is supposed to be outside. The word “outside” occurs\r\nat least five times in the depositions of the complaining persons.\r\nSurely by all scientific analogy we may infer that the unusual phrase\r\n“inn-sign” is an acoustic error for “inside.” The word “inside” would so\r\nnaturally occur in any discussion either about the building or the\r\nindividual, when the debate was of a hygienic character. This letter was\r\nsigned “Medical Student,” and the less intelligent parts of it were\r\nselected for publication in the paper.\r\n\r\nThen there was a really humorous man, who wrote and said there was\r\nnothing at all inexplicable or unusual about the case. He himself (he\r\nsaid) had often seen a sign-board outside a pub when he went into it,\r\nand been quite unable to see it when he came out. This letter (the only\r\none that had any quality of literature) was sternly set aside by Mr.\r\nHibbs.\r\n\r\nThen came a cultured gentleman with a light touch, who merely made a\r\nsuggestion. Had anyone read H. G. Wells’s story about the kink in space?\r\nHe contrived, indescribably, to suggest that no one had even heard of it\r\nexcept himself; or, perhaps, of Mr. Wells either. The story indicated\r\nthat men’s feet might be in one part of the world and their eyes in\r\nanother. He offered the suggestion for what it was worth. The particular\r\npile of letters on which Hibbs However threw it, showed only too clearly\r\nwhat it was worth.\r\n\r\nThen there was a man, of course, who called it all a plot of frenzied\r\nforeigners against Britain’s shore. But as he did not make it quite\r\nclear whether the chief wickedness of these aliens had lain in sticking\r\nthe sign up or in pulling it down, his remarks (the remainder of which\r\nreferred exclusively to the conversational misconduct of an Italian\r\nice-cream man, whose side of the case seemed insufficiently represented)\r\ncarried the less weight.\r\n\r\nAnd then, last but the reverse of least, there plunged in all the people\r\nwho think they can solve a problem they cannot understand by abolishing\r\neverything that has contributed to it. We all know these people. If a\r\nbarber has cut his customer’s throat because the girl has changed her\r\npartner for a dance or donkey ride on Hampstead Heath, there are always\r\npeople to protest against the mere institutions that led up to it. This\r\nwould not have happened if barbers were abolished, or if cutlery were\r\nabolished, or if the objection felt by girls to imperfectly grown beards\r\nwere abolished, or if the girls were abolished, or if heaths and open\r\nspaces were abolished, or if dancing were abolished, or if donkeys were\r\nabolished. But donkeys, I fear, will never be abolished.\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of such donkeys in the common land of this particular\r\ncontroversy. Some made it an argument against democracy, because poor\r\nGarge was a carpenter. Some made it an argument against Alien\r\nImmigration, because Misysra Ammon was a Turk. Some proposed that ladies\r\nshould no longer be admitted to any lectures anywhere, because they had\r\nconstituted a slight and temporary difficulty at this one, without the\r\nfaintest fault of their own. Some urged that all holiday resorts should\r\nbe abolished; some urged that all holidays should be abolished. Some\r\nvaguely denounced the sea-side; some, still more vaguely, proposed to\r\nremove the sea. All said that if this or that, stones or sea-weed or\r\nstrange visitors or bad weather or bathing machines were swept away with\r\na strong hand, this which had happened would not have happened. They\r\nonly had one slight weakness, all of them; that they did not seem to\r\nhave the faintest notion of what _had_ happened. And in this they were\r\nnot inexcusable. Nobody did know what had happened; nobody knows it to\r\nthis day, of course, or it would be unnecessary to write this story. No\r\none can suppose this story is written from any motive save that of\r\ntelling the plain, humdrum truth.\r\n\r\nThat queer confused cunning which was the only definable quality\r\npossessed by Hibbs However had certainly scored a victory so far, for\r\nthe tone of the weekly papers followed him, with more intelligence and\r\nless trepidation; but they followed him. It seemed more and more clear\r\nthat some kind of light and sceptical explanation was to be given of the\r\nwhole business, and that the whole business was to be dropped.\r\n\r\nThe story of the sign-board and the ethical chapel of corrugated iron\r\nwas discussed and somewhat disparaged in all the more serious and\r\nespecially in the religious weeklies, though the Low Church papers\r\nseemed to reserve their distaste chiefly for the sign-board; and the\r\nHigh Church papers chiefly for the Chapel. All agreed that the\r\ncombination was incongruous, and most treated it as fabulous. The only\r\nintellectual organs which seemed to think it might have happened were\r\nthe Spiritualist papers, and their interpretation had not that solidity\r\nwhich would have satisfied Mr. George.\r\n\r\nIt was not until almost a year after that it was felt in philosophical\r\ncircles that the last word had been said on the matter. An estimate of\r\nthe incident and of its bearing on natural and supernatural history\r\noccurred in Professor Widge’s celebrated “Historicity of the\r\nPetro-Piscatorial Phenomena”; which so profoundly affected modern\r\nthought when it came out in parts in the _Hibbert Journal_. Everyone\r\nremembers Professor Widge’s main contention, that the modern critic must\r\napply to the thaumaturgics of the Lake of Tiberias the same principle of\r\ncriticism which Dr. Bunk and others have so successfully applied to the\r\nthaumaturgics of the Cana narrative: “Authorities as final as Pink and\r\nToscher,” wrote the Professor, “have now shown with an emphasis that no\r\nemancipated mind is entitled to question, that the Aqua-Vinic\r\nthaumaturgy at Cana is wholly inconsistent with the psychology of the\r\n‘master of the feast,’ as modern research has analysed it; and indeed\r\nwith the whole Judæo-Aramaic psychology at that stage of its\r\ndevelopment, as well as being painfully incongruous with the elevated\r\nideals of the ethical teacher in question. But as we rise to higher\r\nlevels of moral achievement, it will probably be found necessary to\r\napply the Canaic principle to other and later events in the narrative.\r\nThis principle has, of course, been mainly expounded by Huscher in the\r\nsense that the whole episode is unhistorical, while the alternative\r\ntheory, that the wine was non-alcoholic and was naturally infused into\r\nthe water, can claim on its side the impressive name of Minns. It is\r\nclear that if we apply the same alternative to the so-called Miraculous\r\nDraught of Fishes we must either hold with Gilp, that the fishes were\r\nstuffed representations of fishes artificially placed in the lake (see\r\nthe Rev. Y. Wyse’s “Christo-Vegetarianism as a World-System,” where this\r\nposition is forcibly set forth), or we must, on the Huscherian\r\nhypothesis, deprive the Piscatorial narrative of all claim to\r\nhistoricity whatever.\r\n\r\n“The difficulty felt by the most daring critics (even Pooke) in adopting\r\nthis entirely destructive attitude, is the alleged improbability of so\r\ndetailed a narrative being founded on so slight a phrase as the\r\nanti-historical critics refer it to. It is urged by Pooke, with\r\ncharacteristic relentless reasoning, that according to Huscher’s theory\r\na metaphorical but at least noticeable remark, such as, ‘I will make you\r\nfishers of men,’ was expanded into a realistic chronicle of events which\r\ncontains no mention, even in the passages evidently interpolated, of any\r\nmen actually found in the nets when they were hauled up out of the sea;\r\nor, more properly, lagoon.\r\n\r\n“It must appear presumptuous or even bad taste for anyone in the modern\r\nworld to differ on any subject from Pooke; but I would venture to\r\nsuggest that the very academic splendour and unique standing of the\r\nvenerable professor (whose ninety-seventh birthday was so beautifully\r\ncelebrated in Chicago last year), may have forbidden him all but\r\nintuitive knowledge of how errors arise among the vulgar. I crave pardon\r\nfor mentioning a modern case known to myself (not indeed by personal\r\npresence, but by careful study of all the reports) which presents a\r\ncurious parallel to such ancient expansions of a text into an incident,\r\nin accordance with Huscher’s law.\r\n\r\n“It occurred at Pebblewick, in the south of England. The town had long\r\nbeen in a state of dangerous religious excitement. The great religious\r\ngenius who has since so much altered our whole attitude to the religions\r\nof the world, Misysra Ammon, had been lecturing on the sands to\r\nthousands of enthusiastic hearers. Their meetings were often\r\ninterrupted, both by children’s services run on the most ruthless lines\r\nof orthodoxy and by the League of the Red Rosette, the formidable\r\natheist and anarchist organization. As if this were not enough to swell\r\nthe whirlpool of fanaticism, the old popular controversy between the\r\nMilnian and the Complete Sublapsarians broke out again on the fated\r\nbeach. It is natural to conjecture that in the thickening atmosphere of\r\ntheology in Pebblewick, some controversialist quoted the text ‘An evil\r\nand adulterous generation _seek for a sign_. But no sign shall be given\r\nit save the sign of the prophet Jonas.’\r\n\r\n“A mind like that of Pooke will find it hard to credit, but it seems\r\ncertain that the effect of this text on the ignorant peasantry of\r\nsouthern England was actually to make them go about looking for a sign,\r\nin the sense of those old tavern signs now so happily disappearing. The\r\n‘sign of the Prophet Jonas,’ they somehow translated in their stunted\r\nminds into a sign-board of the ship out of which Jonah was thrown. They\r\nwent about literally looking for ‘The Sign of the Ship,’ and there are\r\nsome cases of their suffering Smail’s Hallucination and actually seeing\r\nit. The whole incident is a curious parallel to the Gospel narrative and\r\na triumphant vindication of Huscher’s law.”\r\n\r\nLord Ivywood paid a public compliment to Professor Widge, saying that he\r\nhad rolled back from his country what might have been an ocean of\r\nsuperstitions. But, indeed, poor Hibbs had struck the first and stunning\r\nblow that scattered the brains of all men.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                        THE CHARACTER OF QUOODLE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE lay about in Lord Ivywood’s numerous gardens, terraces, outhouses,\r\nstable yards and similar places, a dog that came to be called by the\r\nname of Quoodle. Lord Ivywood did not call him Quoodle. Lord Ivywood was\r\nalmost physically incapable of articulating such sounds. Lord Ivywood\r\ndid not care for dogs. He cared for the Cause of dogs, of course; and he\r\ncared still more for his own intellectual self-respect and consistency.\r\nHe would never have permitted a dog in his house to be physically\r\nill-treated; nor, for that matter, a rat; nor, for that matter, even a\r\nman. But if Quoodle was not physically ill-treated, he was at least\r\nsocially neglected, and Quoodle did not like it. For dogs care for\r\ncompanionship more than for kindness itself.\r\n\r\nLord Ivywood would probably have sold the dog, but he consulted experts\r\n(as he did on everything he didn’t understand and many things that he\r\ndid), and the impression he gathered from them was that the dog,\r\ntechnically considered, would fetch very little; mostly, it seemed,\r\nbecause of the mixture of qualities that it possessed. It was a sort of\r\nmongrel bull-terrier, but with rather too much of the bull-dog; and this\r\nfact seemed to weaken its price as much as it strengthened its jaw. His\r\nLordship also gained a hazy impression that the dog might have been\r\nvaluable as a watch-dog if it had not been able to follow game like a\r\npointer; and that even in the latter walk of life it would always be\r\ndiscredited by an unfortunate talent for swimming as well as a\r\nretriever. But Lord Ivywood’s impressions may very well have been\r\nslightly confused, as he was probably thinking about the Black stone of\r\nMecca, or some such subject at the moment. The victim of this\r\nentanglement of virtues, therefore, still lay about in the sunlight of\r\nIvywood, exhibiting no general result of that entanglement except the\r\nmost appalling ugliness.\r\n\r\nNow Lady Joan Brett did appreciate dogs. It was the whole of her type\r\nand a great deal of her tragedy that all that was natural in her was\r\nstill alive under all that was artificial; and she could smell hawthorn\r\nor the sea as far off as a dog can smell his dinner. Like most\r\naristocrats she would carry cynicism almost to the suburbs of the city\r\nof Satan; she was quite as irreligious as Lord Ivywood, or rather more.\r\nShe could be quite equally frigid or supercilious when she felt\r\ninclined. And in the great social talent of being tired, she could beat\r\nhim any day of the week. But the difference remained in spite of her\r\nsophistries and ambitions; that her elemental communications were not\r\ncut, and his were. For her the sunrise was still the rising of a sun,\r\nand not the turning on of a light by a convenient cosmic servant. For\r\nher the Spring was really the Season in the country, and not merely the\r\nSeason in town. For her cocks and hens were natural appendages to an\r\nEnglish house; and not (as Lord Ivywood had proved to her from an\r\nencyclopædia) animals of Indian origin, recently imported by Alexander\r\nthe Great. And so for her a dog was a dog, and not one of the higher\r\nanimals, nor one of the lower animals, nor something that had the\r\nsacredness of life, nor something that ought to be muzzled, nor\r\nsomething that ought not to be vivisected. She knew that in every\r\npractical sense proper provision would be made for the dog; as, indeed,\r\nprovision was made for the yellow dogs in Constantinople by Abdul Hamid,\r\nwhose life Lord Ivywood was writing for the _Progressive Potentates_\r\nseries. Nor was she in the least sentimental about the dog or anxious to\r\nturn him into a pet. It simply came natural to her in passing to rub all\r\nhis hair the wrong way and call him something which she instantly\r\nforgot.\r\n\r\nThe man who was mowing the garden lawn looked up for a moment, for he\r\nhad never seen the dog behave in exactly that way before. Quoodle arose,\r\nshook himself, and trotted on in front of the lady, leading her up an\r\niron side staircase, of which, as it happened, she had never made use\r\nbefore. It was then, most probably, that she first took any special\r\nnotice of him; and her pleasure, like that which she took in the sublime\r\nprophet from Turkey, was of a humorous character. For the complex\r\nquadruped had retained the bow legs of the bull-dog; and, seen from\r\nbehind, reminded her ridiculously of a swaggering little Major waddling\r\ndown to his Club.\r\n\r\nThe dog and the iron stairway between them led her into a series of long\r\nrooms, one opening into the other. They formed part of what she had\r\nknown in earlier days as the disused Wing of Ivywood House, which had\r\nbeen neglected or shut up, probably because it bore some defacements\r\nfrom the fancies of the mad ancestor, the memory of whom the present\r\nLord Ivywood did not think helpful to his own political career. But it\r\nseemed to Joan that there were indications of a recent attempt to\r\nrehabilitate the place. There was a pail of whitewash in one of the\r\nempty rooms, a step-ladder in another, here and there a curtain rod, and\r\nat last, in the fourth room a curtain. It hung all alone on the old\r\nwoodwork, but it was a very gorgeous curtain, being a kind of\r\norange-gold relieved with wavy bars of crimson, which somehow seemed to\r\nsuggest the very spirit and presence of serpents, though they had\r\nneither eyes nor mouths among them.\r\n\r\nIn the next of the endless series of rooms she came upon a kind of\r\nottoman, striped with green and silver standing alone on the bare floor.\r\nShe sat down on it from a mixed motive of fatigue and of impudence, for\r\nshe dimly remembered a story which she had always thought one of the\r\nfunniest in the world, about a lady only partly initiated in Theosophy\r\nwho had been in the habit of resting on a similar object, only to\r\ndiscover afterward that it was a Mahatma, covered with his eastern\r\ngarment and prostrate and rigid in ecstasy. She had no hopes of sitting\r\non a Mahatma herself, but the very thought of it made her laugh, because\r\nit would make Lord Ivywood look such a fool. She was not sure whether\r\nshe liked or disliked Lord Ivywood, but she felt quite certain that it\r\nwould gratify her to make him look a fool. The moment she had sat down\r\non the ottoman, the dog, who had been trotting beside her, sat down\r\nalso, and on the edge of her skirt.\r\n\r\nAfter a minute or two she rose (and the dog rose), and she looked yet\r\nfarther down that long perspective of large rooms, in which men like\r\nPhillip Ivywood forget that they are only men. The next was more ornate\r\nand the next yet more so; it was plain that the scheme of decoration\r\nthat was in progress had been started at the other end. She could now\r\nsee that the long lane ended in rooms that from afar off looked like the\r\nend of a kaleidoscope, rooms like nests made only from humming birds or\r\npalaces built of fixed fireworks. Out of this furnace of fragmentary\r\ncolours she saw Ivywood advancing toward her, with his black suit and\r\nhis white face accented by the contrast. His lips were moving, for he\r\nwas talking to himself, as many orators do. He did not seem to see her,\r\nand she had to strangle a subconscious and utterly senseless cry, “He is\r\nblind!”\r\n\r\nThe next moment he was welcoming her intrusion with the well-bred\r\nsurprise and rather worldly simplicity suitable to such a case, and Joan\r\nfancied she understood why his face had seemed a little bleaker and\r\nblinder than usual. It was by contrast. He was carrying clutched to his\r\nforefinger, as his ancestors might have carried a falcon clutched to the\r\nwrist, a small bright coloured semi-tropical bird, the expression of\r\nwhose head, neck and eye was the very opposite of his own. Joan thought\r\nshe had never seen a living creature with a head so lively and\r\ninsulting. Its provocative eye and pointed crest seemed to be offering\r\nto fight fifty game-cocks. It was no wonder (she told herself) that by\r\nthe side of this gaudy gutter-snipe with feathers Ivywood’s\r\nfaint-coloured hair and frigid face looked like the hair and face of a\r\ncorpse walking.\r\n\r\n“You’ll never know what this is,” said Ivywood, in his most charming\r\nmanner. “You’ve heard of him a hundred times and never had a notion of\r\nwhat he was. This is the Bulbul.”\r\n\r\n“I never knew,” replied Joan. “I am afraid I never cared. I always\r\nthought it was something like a nightingale.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes,” answered Ivywood, “but this is the real Bulbul peculiar to\r\nthe East, _Pycnonotus Hæmorrhous_. You are thinking of _Daulias\r\nGolzii_.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose I am,” replied Lady Joan with a faint smile. “It is an\r\nobsession. When shall I not be thinking of Daulias Galsworthy? Was it\r\nGalsworthy?” Then feeling quite touched by the soft austerity of her\r\ncompanion’s face, she caressed the gaudy and pugnacious bird with one\r\nfinger and said, “It’s a dear little thing.”\r\n\r\nThe quadruped intimately called Quoodle did not approve of all this at\r\nall. Like most dogs, he liked to be with human beings when they were\r\nsilent, and he extended a magnificent toleration to them as long as they\r\nwere talking to each other. But conversational attention paid to any\r\nother animal at all remote from a mongrel bull-terrier wounded Mr.\r\nQuoodle in his most sensitive and gentlemanly feelings. He emitted a\r\nfaint growl. Joan, with all the instincts that were in her, bent down\r\nand pulled his hair about once more, and felt the instant necessity of\r\ndiverting the general admiration from _Pycnonotus Hæmorrhous_. She\r\nturned it to the decoration at the end of the refurnished wing; for they\r\nhad already come to the last of the long suite of rooms, which ended in\r\nsome unfinished but exquisite panelling in white and coloured woods,\r\ninlaid in the oriental manner. At one corner the whole corridor ended by\r\ncurving into a round turret chamber overlooking the landscape; and which\r\nJoan, who had known the house in childhood, was sure was an innovation.\r\nOn the other hand a black gap, still left in the lower left-hand corner\r\nof the oriental woodwork, suddenly reminded her of something she had\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n“Surely,” she said (after much mere æsthetic ecstasy), “there used to be\r\na staircase there, leading to the old kitchen garden, or the old chapel\r\nor something.”\r\n\r\nIvywood nodded gravely. “Yes,” he said, “it did lead to the ruins of a\r\nMediæval Chapel, as you say. The truth is it led to several things that\r\nI cannot altogether consider a credit to the family in these days. All\r\nthat scandal and joking about the unsuccessful tunnel (your mother may\r\nhave told you of it), well, it did us no good in the County, I’m afraid;\r\nso as it’s a mere scrap of land bordering on the sea, I’ve fenced it off\r\nand let it grow wild. But I’m boarding up the end of the room here for\r\nquite another reason. I want you to come and see it.”\r\n\r\nHe led her into the round corner turret in which the new architecture\r\nended, and Joan, with her thirst for the beautiful, could not stifle a\r\ncertain thrill of beatitude at the prospect. Five open windows of a\r\nlight and exquisite Saracenic outline looked out over the bronze and\r\ncopper and purple of the Autumn parks and forests to the peacock colours\r\nof the sea. There was neither house nor living thing in sight, and,\r\nfamiliar as she had been with that coast, she knew she was looking out\r\nfrom a new angle of vision on a new landscape of Ivywood.\r\n\r\n“You can write sonnets?” said Ivywood with something more like emotion\r\nin his voice than she had ever heard in it. “What comes first into your\r\nmind with these open windows?”\r\n\r\n“I know what you mean,” said Joan after a silence. “The same hath\r\noft....”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said. “That is how I felt ... of perilous seas in fairy lands\r\nforlorn.”\r\n\r\nThere was another silence and the dog sniffed round and round the\r\ncircular turret chamber.\r\n\r\n“I want it to be like that,” said Ivywood in a low and singularly moved\r\nintonation. “I want this to be the end of the house. I want this to be\r\nthe end of the world. Don’t you feel that is the real beauty of all this\r\neastern art; that it is coloured like the edges of things, like the\r\nlittle clouds of morning and the islands of the blest? Do you know,” and\r\nhe lowered his voice yet more, “it has the power over me of making me\r\nfeel as if I were myself absent and distant; some oriental traveller who\r\nwas lost and for whom men were looking. When I see that greenish lemon\r\nyellow enamel there let into the white, I feel that I am standing\r\nthousands of leagues from where I stand.”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” said Joan, looking at him with some wonder, “I have\r\nfelt like that myself.”\r\n\r\n“This art,” went on Ivywood as in a dream, “does indeed take the wings\r\nof the morning and abide in the uttermost parts of the sea. They say it\r\ncontains no form of life, but surely we can read its alphabet as easily\r\nas the red hieroglyphics of sunrise and sunset which are on the fringes\r\nof the robe of God.”\r\n\r\n“I never heard you talk like that before,” said the lady, and again\r\nstroked the vivid violet feathers of the small eastern bird.\r\n\r\nMr. Quoodle could stand it no longer. He had evidently formed a very low\r\nopinion of the turret chamber and of oriental art generally, but seeing\r\nJoan’s attention once more transferred to his rival, he trotted out into\r\nthe longer room, and finding the gap in the woodwork which was soon to\r\nbe boarded up, but which still opened on an old dark staircase, he went\r\n“galumphing” down the stairs.\r\n\r\nLord Ivywood gently placed the bird on the girl’s own finger, and went\r\nto one of the open windows, leaning out a little.\r\n\r\n“Look here,” he said, “doesn’t this express what we both feel? Isn’t\r\nthis the sort of fairy-tale house that ought to hang on the last wall of\r\nthe world?”\r\n\r\nAnd he motioned her to the window-sill, just outside which hung the\r\nbird’s empty cage, beautifully wrought in brass or some of the yellow\r\nmetals.\r\n\r\n“Why that is the best of all!” cried Lady Joan. “It makes one feel as if\r\nit really were the Arabian Nights. As if this were a tower of the\r\ngigantic Genii with turrets up to the moon; and this were an enchanted\r\nPrince caged in a golden palace suspended by the evening star.”\r\n\r\nSomething stirred in her dim but teeming subconsciousness, something\r\nlike a chill or change like that by which we half know that weather has\r\naltered, or distant and unnoticed music suddenly ceased.\r\n\r\n“Where is the dog?” she asked suddenly.\r\n\r\nIvywood turned with a mild, grey eye.\r\n\r\n“Was there a dog here?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Lady Joan Brett, and gave him back the bird, which he\r\nrestored carefully to its cage.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe dog after whom she inquired had in truth trundled down a dark,\r\nwinding staircase and turned into the daylight, into a part of the\r\ngarden he had never seen before; nor, indeed, had anybody else for some\r\ntime past. It was altogether tangled and overgrown with weeds, and the\r\nonly trace of human handiwork, the wreck of an old Gothic Chapel, stood\r\nwaist high in numberless nettles and soiled with crawling fungoids. Most\r\nof these merely discoloured the grey crumbling stone with shades of\r\nbronze or brown; but some of them, particularly on the side farthest\r\nfrom the house, were of orange or purple tints almost bright enough for\r\nLord Ivywood’s oriental decoration. Some fanciful eyes that fell on the\r\nplace afterward found something like an allegory in those graven and\r\nbroken saints or archangels feeding such fiery and ephemeral parasites\r\nas those toadstools like blood or gold. But Mr. Quoodle had never set\r\nhimself up as an allegorist, and he merely trotted deeper and deeper\r\ninto the grey-green English jungle. He grumbled very much at the\r\nthistles and nettles, much as a city man will grumble at the jostling of\r\na crowd. But he continued to press forward, with his nose near the\r\nground, as if he had already smelt something that interested him. And,\r\nindeed, he had smelt something in which a dog, except on special\r\noccasions, is much more interested than he is in dogs. Breaking through\r\na last barrier of high and hoary purple thistles he came out on a\r\nsemicircle of somewhat clearer ground, dotted with slender trees, and\r\nhaving, by way of back scene, the brown brick arch of an old tunnel. The\r\ntunnel was boarded up with a very irregular fence or mask made of motley\r\nwooden lathes, and looked, somehow, rather like a pantomime cottage. In\r\nfront of this a sturdy man in very shabby shooting clothes was standing\r\nattending to a battered old frying-pan which he held over a rather\r\nirregular flame which, small as it was, smelt strongly of burnt rum. In\r\nthe frying-pan, and also on the top of a cask or barrel that served for\r\na table hard by, were a number of the grey, brown, and even orange fungi\r\nwhich were plastered over the stone angels and dragons of the fallen\r\nchapel.\r\n\r\n“Hullo, old man,” said the person in the shooting jacket with\r\ntranquillity and without looking up from his cooking. “Come to pay us a\r\nvisit? Come along then.” He flashed one glance at the dog and returned\r\nto the frying pan. “If your tail were two inches shorter, you’d be worth\r\na hundred pounds. Had any breakfast?”\r\n\r\nThe dog trotted across to him and began nosing and sniffing round his\r\ndilapidated leather gaiters. The man did not interrupt his cookery, on\r\nwhich his eyes were fixed and both his hands were busy; but he crooked\r\nhis knee and foot so as to caress the quadruped in a nerve under the\r\nangle of the jaw, the stimulation of which (as some men of science have\r\nheld) is for a dog what a good cigar is for a man. At the same moment a\r\nhuge voice like on ogre’s came from within the masked tunnel, calling\r\nout, “And who are ye talking to?”\r\n\r\nA very crooked kind of window in the upper part of the pantomime cottage\r\nburst open and an enormous head, with erect, startling, and almost\r\nscarlet hair and blue eyes as big as a bullfrog’s, was thrust out above\r\nthe scene.\r\n\r\n“Hump,” cried the ogre. “Me moral counsels have been thrown away. In the\r\nlast week I’ve sung you fourteen and a half songs of me own composition;\r\ninstead of which you go about stealing dogs. You’re following in the\r\npath of Parson Whats-his-name in every way, I’m afraid.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the man with the frying pan, impartially, “Parson Whitelady\r\nstruck a very good path for doubling on Pebblewick, that I was glad to\r\nfollow. But I think he was quite silly to steal dogs. He was young and\r\nbrought up pious. I know too much about dogs to steal one.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” asked the large red-haired man, “and how do you get a dog like\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\n“I let him steal me,” said the person stirring the pan. And indeed the\r\ndog was sitting erect and even arrogant at his feet, as if he was a\r\nwatch-dog at a high salary, and had been there before the building of\r\nthe tunnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                   VEGETARIANISM IN THE DRAWING-ROOM\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Company that assembled to listen to the Prophet of the Moon, on the\r\nnext occasion of his delivering any formal address, was much more select\r\nthan the comparatively mixed and middle-class society of the Simple\r\nSouls. Miss Browning and her sister, Mrs. Mackintosh, were indeed\r\npresent; for Lord Ivywood had practically engaged them both as private\r\nsecretaries, and kept them pretty busy, too. There was also Mr. Leveson,\r\nbecause Lord Ivywood believed in his organizing power; and also Mr.\r\nHibbs, because Mr. Leveson believed in his political judgment, whenever\r\nhe could discover what it was. Mr. Leveson had straight, dark hair, and\r\nlooked nervous. Mr. Hibbs had straight, fair hair, and also looked\r\nnervous. But the rest of the company were more of Ivywood’s own world,\r\nor the world of high finance with which it mixes both here and on the\r\ncontinent. Lord Ivywood welcomed, with something approaching to warmth,\r\na distinguished foreign diplomatist, who was, indeed, none other than\r\nthat silent German representative who had sat beside him in that last\r\nconference on the Island of the Olives. Dr. Gluck was no longer in his\r\nquiet, black suit, but wore an ornate, diplomatic uniform with a sword\r\nand Prussian, Austrian or Turkish Orders; for he was going on from\r\nIvywood to a function at Court. But his curl of red lips, his screw of\r\nblack mustache, and his unanswering almond eyes had no more changed than\r\nthe face of a wax figure in a barber’s shop window.\r\n\r\nThe Prophet had also effected an improvement in his dress. When he had\r\norated on the sands his costume, except for the fez, was the shabby but\r\nrespectable costume of any rather unsuccessful English clerk. But now\r\nthat he had come among aristocrats who petted their souls as they did\r\ntheir senses, there must be no such incongruity. He must be a proper,\r\nfresh-picked oriental tulip or lotus. So—he wore long, flowing robes of\r\nwhite, relieved here and there by flame-coloured threads of tracery, and\r\nround his head was a turban of a kind of pale golden green. He had to\r\nlook as if he had come flying across Europe on the magic carpet, or\r\nfallen a moment before from his paradise in the moon.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of Lord Ivywood’s world were much as we have already found\r\nthem. Lady Enid Wimpole still overwhelmed her earnest and timid face\r\nwith a tremendous costume, that was more like a procession than a dress.\r\nIt looked rather like the funeral procession of Aubrey Beardsley. Lady\r\nJoan Brett still looked like a very beautiful Spaniard with no illusions\r\nleft about her castle in Spain. The large and resolute lady who had\r\nrefused to ask any questions at Misysra’s earlier lecture, and who was\r\nknown as Lady Crump, the distinguished Feminist, still had the air of\r\nbeing so full and bursting with questions fatal to Man as to have passed\r\nthe speaking and reached the speechless stage of hostility. Throughout\r\nthe proceedings she contributed nothing but bursting silence and a\r\nmalevolent eye. And old Lady Ivywood, under the oldest and finest lace\r\nand the oldest and finest manners, had a look like death on her, which\r\ncan often be seen in the parents of pure intellectuals. She had that\r\nface of a lost mother that is more pathetic than the face of a lost\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n“And what are you going to delight us with today?” Lady Enid was asking\r\nof the Prophet.\r\n\r\n“My lecture,” answered Misysra, gravely, “is on the Pig.”\r\n\r\nIt was part of a simplicity really respectable in him that he never saw\r\nany incongruity in the arbitrary and isolated texts or symbols out of\r\nwhich he spun his thousand insane theories. Lady Enid endured the impact\r\nof this singular subject for debate without losing that expression of\r\nwistful sweetness which she wore on principle when talking to such\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n“The Pig, he is a large subject,” continued the Prophet, making curves\r\nin the air, as if embracing some particularly prize specimen. “He\r\nincludes many subjects. It is to me very strange that the Christians\r\nshould so laugh and be surprised because we hold ourselves to be defiled\r\nby pork; we and also another of the Peoples of the Book. But, surely,\r\nyou Christians yourselves consider the pig as a manner of pollution;\r\nsince it is your most usual expression of your despising, of your very\r\ngreat dislike. You say ‘swine,’ my dear lady; you do not say animals far\r\nmore unpopular, such as the alligator.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said the lady, “how wonderful!”\r\n\r\n“If you are annoyed,” went on the encouraged and excited gentleman, “if\r\nyou are annoyed with anyone, with a—what you say?—a lady’s maid, you do\r\nnot say to her ‘Horse.’ You do not say to her ‘Camel.’”\r\n\r\n“Ah, no,” said Lady Enid, earnestly.\r\n\r\n“‘Pig of a lady’s maid,’ you say in your colloquial English,” continued\r\nthe Prophet, triumphantly. “And yet this great and awful Pig, this\r\nmonster whose very name, when whispered, you think will wither all your\r\nenemies, you allow, my dear lady, to approach yet closer to you. You\r\nincorporate this great Pig in the substance of your own person.”\r\n\r\nLady Enid Wimpole was looking a little dazed at last, at this\r\ndescription of her habits, and Joan gave Lord Ivywood a hint that the\r\nlecturer had better be transferred to his legitimate sphere of\r\nlecturing. Ivywood led the way into a larger room that was full of\r\nranked chairs, with a sort of lectern at the other end, and flanked on\r\nall four sides with tables laden with all kinds of refreshments. It was\r\ntypical of the strange, half-fictitious enthusiasm and curiosity of that\r\nworld, that one long table was set out entirely with vegetarian foods,\r\nespecially of an eastern sort (like a table spread in the desert for a\r\nrather fastidious Indian hermit); but that tables covered with game\r\npatties, lobster and champagne were equally provided, and very much more\r\nfrequented. Even Mr. Hibbs, who would honestly have thought entering a\r\npublichouse more disgraceful than entering a brothel, could not connect\r\nany conception of disgrace with Lord Ivywood’s champagne.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of the lecture was not wholly devoted to the great and\r\nawful Pig, and the purpose of the meeting even less. Lord Ivywood, the\r\nwhite furnace of whose mind was always full of new fancies hardening\r\ninto ambitions, wanted to have a debate on the diet of East and West,\r\nand felt that Misysra might very appropriately open with an account of\r\nthe Moslem veto on pork or other coarse forms of flesh food. He reserved\r\nit to himself to speak second.\r\n\r\nThe Prophet began, indeed, with some of his dizziest flights. He\r\ninformed the Company that they, the English, had always gone in hidden\r\nterror and loathing of the Pig, as a sacred symbol of evil. He proved it\r\nby the common English custom of drawing a pig with one’s eyes shut. Lady\r\nJoan smiled, and yet she asked herself (in a doubt that had been\r\ndarkening round her about many modern things lately) whether it was\r\nreally much more fanciful than many things the scientists told her: as,\r\nthe traces of Marriage by Capture which they found in that ornamental\r\nand even frivolous being, the Best Man.\r\n\r\nHe said that the dawn of greater enlightenment is shown in the use of\r\nthe word “gammon,” which still expresses disgust at “the porcine image,”\r\nbut no longer fear of it, but rather a rational disdain and disbelief.\r\n“Rowley,” said the Prophet, solemnly, and then after a long pause,\r\n“Powley, _Gammon_ and Spinach.”\r\n\r\nLady Joan smiled again, but again asked herself if it was much more\r\nfarfetched than a history book she had read, which proved the\r\nunpopularity of Catholicism in Tudor times from the word “hocus pocus.”\r\n\r\nHe got into a most amazing labyrinth of philology between the red\r\nprimeval sins of the first pages of Genesis and the Common English word\r\n“ham.” But, again, Joan wondered whether it was much wilder than the\r\nother things she had heard said about Primitive Man by people who had\r\nnever seen him.\r\n\r\nHe suggested that the Irish were set to keep pigs because they were a\r\nlow and defiled caste, and the serfs of the pig-scorning Saxon; and Joan\r\nthought it was about as sensible as what the dear old Archdeacon had\r\nsaid about Ireland years ago; which had caused an Irishman of her\r\nacquaintance to play “the Shan Van Voght” and then smash the piano.\r\n\r\nJoan Brett had been thoughtful for the last few days. It was partly due\r\nto the scene in the turret, where she had struck a sensitive and\r\nartistic side of Phillip Ivywood she had never seen before, and partly\r\nto disturbing news of her mother’s health, which, though not menacing,\r\nmade her feel hypothetically how isolated she was in the world. On all\r\nprevious occasions she had merely enjoyed the mad lecturer now at the\r\nreading-desk. Today she felt a strange desire to analyse him, and\r\nimagine how a man could be so connected and so convinced and yet so\r\nwildly wide of the mark. As she listened carefully, looking at the hands\r\nin her lap, she began to think she understood.\r\n\r\nThe lecturer did really try to prove that the “porcine image” had never\r\nbeen used in English history or literature, except in contempt. And the\r\nlecturer really did know a very great deal about English history and\r\nliterature: much more than she did; much more than the aristocrats round\r\nher did. But she noted that in every case what he knew was a fragmentary\r\nfact. In every case what he did not know was the truth behind the fact.\r\nWhat he did not know was the atmosphere. What he did not know was the\r\ntradition. She found herself ticking off the cases like counts in an\r\nindictment.\r\n\r\nMisysra Ammon knew, what next to none of the English present knew, that\r\nRichard III was called a “boar” by an eighteenth century poet and a\r\n“hog” by a fifteenth century poet. What he did not know was the habit of\r\nsport and of heraldry. He did not know (what Joan knew instantly, though\r\nshe had never thought of it before in her life) that beasts courageous\r\nand hard to kill are noble beasts, by the law of chivalry. Therefore,\r\nthe boar was a noble beast, and a common crest for great captains.\r\nMisysra tried to show that Richard had only been called a pig after he\r\nwas cold pork at Bosworth.\r\n\r\nMisysra Ammon knew, what next to none of the English present knew, that\r\nthere never was such a person as Lord Bacon. The phrase is a\r\nfalsification of what should be Lord Verulam or Lord St. Albans. What he\r\ndid not know was exactly what Joan did know (though it had never crossed\r\nher mind till that moment) that when all is said and done, a title is a\r\nsort of joke, while a surname is a serious thing. Bacon was a gentleman,\r\nand his name was Bacon; whatever titles he took. But Misysra seriously\r\ntried to prove that “Bacon” was a term of abuse applied to him during\r\nhis unpopularity or after his fall.\r\n\r\nMisysra Ammon knew, what next to none of the English present knew, that\r\nthe poet Shelley had a friend called Hogg, who treated him on one\r\noccasion with grave treachery. He instantly tried to prove that the man\r\nwas only called “Hogg” because he had treated Shelley with grave\r\ntreachery. And he actually adduced the fact that another poet,\r\npractically contemporary, was called “Hogg” as completing the connection\r\nwith Shelley. What he did not know was just what Joan had always known\r\nwithout knowing it: the kind of people concerned, the traditions of\r\naristocrats like the Shelleys or of Borderers like the Ettrick Shepherd.\r\n\r\nThe lecturer concluded with a passage of inpenetrable darkness about\r\npig-iron and pigs of lead, which Joan did not even venture to\r\nunderstand. She could only say that if it did not mean that some day our\r\ndiet might become so refined that we ate lead and iron, she could form\r\nno fancy of what it did mean.\r\n\r\n“Can Phillip Ivywood believe this kind of thing?” she asked herself; and\r\neven as she did so, Phillip Ivywood rose.\r\n\r\nHe had, as Pitt and Gladstone had, an impromptu classicism of diction,\r\nhis words wheeling and deploying into their proper places like a\r\nwell-disciplined army in its swiftest advance. And it was not long\r\nbefore Joan perceived that the last phase of the picture, obscure and\r\nmonstrous as it seemed, gave Ivywood exactly the opening he wanted.\r\nIndeed, she felt, no doubt, that he had arranged for it beforehand.\r\n\r\n“It is within my memory,” said Lord Ivywood, “though it need in no case\r\nhave encumbered yours, that when it was my duty to precede the admired\r\nlecturer whom I now feel it a privilege even to follow, I submitted a\r\nsuggestion which, however simple, would appear to many paradoxical. I\r\naffirmed or implied the view that the religion of Mahomet was, in a\r\npeculiar sense, a religion of progress. This is so contrary, not only to\r\nhistorical convention but to common platitude, that I shall find no\r\nground either of surprise or censure if it takes a perceptible time\r\nbefore it sinks into the mind of the English public. But I think, ladies\r\nand gentlemen, that this period is notably abbreviated by the remarkable\r\nexposition which we have heard today. For this question of the attitude\r\nof Islam toward food affords as excellent an example of its special mode\r\nof progressive purification as the more popular example of its attitude\r\ntoward drink. For it illustrates that principle which I have ventured to\r\ncall the principle of the Crescent: the principle of perpetual growth\r\ntoward an implied and infinite perfection.\r\n\r\n“The great religion of Islam does not of itself forbid the eating of\r\nflesh foods. But, in accordance with that principle of growth which is\r\nits life, it has pointed the way to a perfection not yet perhaps fully\r\nattainable by our nature; it has taken a plain and strong example of the\r\ndangers of meat-eating; and hung up the repellent carcass as a warning\r\nand a sign. In the gradual emergence of mankind from a gross and\r\nsanguinary mode of sustenance, the Semite has led the way. He has laid,\r\nas it were, a symbolic embargo upon the beast typical, the beast of\r\nbeasts. With the instinct of the true mystic, he selected for exemption\r\nfrom such cannibal feasts the creature which appeals to both sides of\r\nthe higher vegetarian ethic. The pig is at once the creature whose\r\nhelplessness most moves our pity and whose ugliness most repels our\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n“It would be foolish to affirm that no difficulty arises out of the\r\ndifferent stages of moral evolution in which the different races find\r\nthemselves. Thus it is constantly said, and such things are not said\r\nwithout some excuse in document or incident, that followers of the\r\nProphet have specialised in the arts of war and have come into a\r\ncontact, not invariably friendly, with those Hindoos of India who have\r\nspecialised in the arts of Peace. In the same way the Hindoos, it must\r\nbe confessed, have been almost as much in advance of Islam in the\r\nquestion of meat as Islam is in advance of Christianity in the matter of\r\ndrink. It must be remembered again and again, ladies and gentlemen, that\r\nevery allegation we have of any difference between Hindoo and Moslem\r\ncomes through a Christian channel, and is therefore tainted evidence.\r\nBut in this matter, even, can we not see the perils of disregarding such\r\nplain danger signals as the veto on pork? Did not an Empire nearly slip\r\nout of our hands because our hands were greased with cow-fat? And did\r\nnot the well of Cawnpore brim with blood instead of water because we\r\nwould not listen to the instinct of the Oriental about the shedding of\r\nsacred blood?\r\n\r\n“But if it be proposed, with whatever graduation, to approach that\r\nrepudiation of flesh food which Buddhism mainly and Islam partly\r\nrecommends, it will always be asked by those who hate the very vision of\r\nProgress—‘Where do you draw the line? May I eat oysters? May I eat eggs?\r\nMay I drink milk?’ You may. You may eat or drink anything essential to\r\nyour stage of evolution, so long as you are evolving toward a clearer\r\nand cleaner ideal of bodily life. If,” he said gravely, “I may employ a\r\nphrase of flippancy, I would say that you may eat six dozen oysters\r\ntoday, but I should strongly advise five dozen oysters tomorrow. For how\r\nelse has all progress in public or private manners been achieved? Would\r\nnot the primitive cannibals be surprised at the strange distinction we\r\ndraw between men and beasts? All historians pay high honour to the\r\nHuguenots, and the great Huguenot Prince, Henri Quatre. None need deny\r\nthat his aspiration that every Frenchman should have a chicken in his\r\npot was, for his period, a high aspiration. It is no disrespect to him\r\nthat we, mounting to higher levels, and looking down longer\r\nperspectives, consider the chicken. And this august march of discovery\r\npasses figures higher than that of Henry of Navarre. I shall always give\r\na high place, as Islam has always given a high place, to that figure,\r\nmythical or no, which we find presiding over the foundations of\r\nChristianity. I cannot doubt that the fable, incredible and revolting\r\notherwise, which records the rush of swine into the sea, was an allegory\r\nof his early realisation that a spirit, evil indeed, does reside in all\r\nanimals in so far as they tempt us to devour them. I cannot doubt that\r\nthe Prodigal leaving his sins among the swine is another illustration of\r\nthe great thesis of the Prophet of the Moon. But here, also, progress\r\nand relativity are relentless in their advance; and not a few of us may\r\nhave risen today to the point of regretting that the joyful sounds\r\naround the return of the Prodigal should be marred by the moaning of a\r\ncalf.\r\n\r\n“For the rest, he who asks us whither we go knows not the meaning of\r\nProgress. If we come at last to live on light, as men said of the\r\nchameleon, if some cosmic magic closed to us now, as radium was but\r\nrecently closed, allows us to transmute the very metals into flesh\r\nwithout breaking into the bloody house of life, we shall know these\r\nthings when we have achieved them. It is enough for us now if we have\r\nreached a spiritual station, in which at least the living head we lop\r\nhas not eyes to reproach us; and the herbs we gather cannot cry against\r\nour cruelty like the mandrake.”\r\n\r\nLord Ivywood resumed his seat, his colourless lips still moving. By some\r\nprevious arrangement, probably, Mr. Leveson rose to move a motion about\r\nVegetarianism. Mr. Leveson was of opinion that the Jewish and Moslem\r\nveto on pork had been the origin of Vegetarianism. He thought it was a\r\ngreat step, and showed how progressive the creed could be. He thought\r\nthe persecution of the Hindoos by Moslems had probably been much\r\nexaggerated; he thought our experience in the Indian Mutiny showed we\r\nconsidered the feeling of Easterners too little in such matters. He\r\nthought Vegetarianism in some ways an advance on orthodox Christianity.\r\nHe thought we must be ready for yet further advances; and he sat down.\r\nAnd as he had said precisely, clause by clause, everything that Lord\r\nIvywood had said, it is needless to say that that nobleman afterward\r\ncongratulated him on the boldness and originality of his brilliant\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nAt a similar sort of preconcerted signal, Hibbs However rose rather\r\nvaguely to his feet to second the motion. He rather prided himself on\r\nbeing a man of few words, in the vocal sense; he was no orator, as\r\nBrutus was. It was only with pen in hand, in an office lined with works\r\nof reference, that he could feel that sense of confused responsibility\r\nthat was the one pleasure of his life. But on this occasion he was\r\nbrighter than usual; partly because he liked being in a lord’s house;\r\npartly because he had never tasted champagne before, and he felt as if\r\nit agreed with him; partly because he saw in the subject of Progress an\r\ninfinite opportunity of splitting hairs.\r\n\r\n“Whatever,” said Hibbs, with a solemn cough, “whatever we may think of\r\nthe old belief that Moslems have differed from Buddhism in a regrettable\r\nway, there can be no doubt the responsibility lay with the Christian\r\nChurches. Had the Free Churches put their foot down and met Messrs.\r\nOpalstein’s demand, we should have heard nothing of these old\r\ndifferences between one belief and another.” As it was, it reminded him\r\nof Napoleon. He gave his own opinion for what it was worth, but he was\r\nnot afraid to say at any cost, even there and in that company, that this\r\nbusiness of Asiatic vegetation had occupied less of the time of the\r\nWesleyan Conference than it should have done. He would be the last to\r\nsay, of course, that anyone was in any sense to blame. They all knew Dr.\r\nCoon’s qualifications. They all knew as well as he did, that a more\r\nstrenuous social worker than Charles Chadder had never rallied the\r\nforces of progress. But that which was not really an indiscretion might\r\nbe represented as an indiscretion, and perhaps we had had enough of that\r\njust lately. It was all very well to talk about Coffe but it should be\r\nremembered, with no disrespect to those in Canada to whom we owe so\r\nmuch, that all that happened before 1891. No one had less desire to\r\noffend our Ritualistic friends than he did, but he had no hesitation in\r\nsaying that the question was a question that could be asked, and though\r\nno doubt, from one point of view the goat’s—\r\n\r\nLady Joan moved sharply in her chair, as if gripped by sudden pain. And,\r\nindeed, she had suddenly felt the chronic and recurrent pain of her\r\nlife. She was brave about bodily pain, as are most women, even luxurious\r\nwomen: but the torment that from time to time returned and tore her was\r\none to which many philosophical names have been given, but no name so\r\nphilosophical as Boredom.\r\n\r\nShe felt she could not stand a minute more of Mr. Hibbs. She felt she\r\nwould die if she heard about the goats—from one or any point of view.\r\nShe slipped from her chair and somehow slid round the corner, in\r\npretence of seeking one of the tables of refreshment in the new wing.\r\nShe was soon among the new oriental apartments, now almost completed;\r\nbut she took no refreshments, though attenuated tables could still be\r\nfound here and there. She threw herself on an ottoman and stared toward\r\nthe empty and elfin turret chamber, in which Ivywood had made her\r\nunderstand that he, also, could thirst for beauty and desire to be at\r\npeace. He certainly had a poetry of his own, after all; a poetry that\r\nnever touched earth; the poetry of Shelley rather than Shakespeare. His\r\nphrase about the fairy turret was true: it did look like the end of the\r\nworld. It did seem to teach her that there is always some serene limit\r\nat last.\r\n\r\nShe started and half rose on her elbow with a small laugh. A dog of\r\nludicrous but familiar appearance came shuffling toward her and she\r\nlifted herself in the act of lifting him. She also lifted her head, and\r\nsaw something that seemed to her, in a sense more Christian and\r\ncatastrophic, very like the end of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                      VEGETARIANISM IN THE FOREST\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMPHREY PUMP’S cooking of a fungus in an old frying-pan (which he had\r\nfound on the beach) was extremely typical of him. He was, indeed,\r\nwithout any pretence of book-learning, a certain kind of scientific man\r\nthat science has really been unfortunate in losing. He was the\r\nold-fashioned English Naturalist like Gilbert White or even Isaac\r\nWalton, who learned things not academically like an American Professor,\r\nbut actually, like an American Indian. And every truth a man has found\r\nout as a man of science is always subtly different from any truth he has\r\nfound out as a man, because a man’s family, friends, habits and social\r\ntype have always got well under way before he has thoroughly learned the\r\ntheory of anything. For instance, any eminent botanist at a _Soirée_ of\r\nthe Royal Society could tell you, of course, that other edible fungi\r\nexist, as well as mushrooms and truffles. But long before he was a\r\nbotanist, still less an eminent botanist, he had begun, so to speak, on\r\na basis of mushrooms and truffles. He felt, in a vague way, that these\r\nwere really edible, that mushrooms were a moderate luxury, proper to the\r\nmiddle classes, while truffles were a much more expensive luxury, more\r\nsuitable to the Smart Set. But the old English Naturalists, of whom\r\nIsaac Walton was perhaps the first, and Humphrey Pump perhaps the last,\r\nhad in many cases really begun at the other end, and found by experience\r\n(often most disastrous experience) that some fungi are wholesome and\r\nsome are not; but the wholesome ones are, on a whole, the majority. So a\r\nman like Pump was no more afraid of a fungus as such than he was of an\r\nanimal as such. He no more started with the supposition that a grey or\r\npurple growth on a stone must be a poisonous growth than he started with\r\nthe supposition that the dog who came to him out of the wood must be a\r\nmad dog. Most of them he knew; those he did not know he treated with\r\nrational caution, but to him, as a whole race, these weird-hued and\r\none-legged goblins of the forests were creatures friendly to man.\r\n\r\n“You see,” he said to his friend the Captain, “eating vegetables isn’t\r\nhalf bad, so long as you know what vegetables there are and eat all of\r\nthem that you can. But there are two ways where it goes wrong among the\r\ngentry. First, they’ve never had to eat a carrot or a potato because it\r\nwas all there was in the house; so they’ve never learnt how to be really\r\nhungry for carrots, as that donkey might be. They only know the\r\nvegetables that are meant to help the meat. They know you take duck and\r\npeas; and when they turn vegetarian they can only think of the peas\r\nwithout the duck. They know you take lobster in a salad; and when they\r\nturn vegetarian they can only think of the salad without the lobster.\r\nBut the other reason is worse. There’s plenty of good people even round\r\nhere, and still more in the north, who get meat very seldom. But then,\r\nwhen they do get it, they gobble it up like good ’uns. But the trouble\r\nwith the gentry is different. The trouble is, the same sort of gentry\r\nthat don’t want to eat meat don’t really want to eat anything. The man\r\ncalled a Vegetarian who goes to Ivywood House is generally like a cow\r\ntrying to live on a blade of grass a day. You and I, Captain, have\r\npretty well been vegetarians for some time, so as not to break into the\r\ncheese, and we haven’t found it so difficult, because we eat as much as\r\nwe can.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not so difficult as being teetotallers,” answered Dalroy, “so as\r\nnot to break into the cask. But I’ll never deny that I feel the better\r\nfor that, too, on the whole. But only because I could leave off being\r\none whenever I chose. And, now I come to think of it,” he cried, with\r\none of his odd returns of animal energy, “if I’m to be a vegetarian why\r\nshouldn’t I drink? Why shouldn’t I have a purely vegetarian drink? Why\r\nshouldn’t I take vegetables in their highest form, so to speak? The\r\nmodest vegetarians ought obviously to stick to wine or beer, plain\r\nvegetarian drinks, instead of filling their goblets with the blood of\r\nbulls and elephants, as all conventional meat-eaters do, I suppose. What\r\nis the matter?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” answered Pump. “I was looking out for somebody who generally\r\nturns up about this time. But I think I’m fast.”\r\n\r\n“I should never have thought so from the look of you,” answered the\r\nCaptain, “but what I’m saying is that the drinking of decent fermented\r\nliquor is just simply the triumph of vegetarianism. Why, it’s an\r\ninspiring idea! I could write a sort of song about it. As, for instance—\r\n\r\n           “You will find me drinking rum\r\n            Like a sailor in a slum,\r\n              You will find me drinking beer like a Bavarian;\r\n            You will find me drinking gin\r\n            In the lowest kind of inn,\r\n              Because I am a rigid Vegetarian.”\r\n\r\nWhy, it’s a vista of verbal felicity and spiritual edification! It has I\r\ndon’t know how many hundred aspects! Let’s see; how could the second\r\nverse go? Something like—\r\n\r\n           “So I cleared the inn of wine,\r\n            And I tried to climb the Sign;\r\n              And I tried to hail the constable as ‘Marion’;\r\n            But he said I couldn’t speak,\r\n             And he bowled me to the Beak,\r\n            Because I was a Happy Vegetarian.”\r\n\r\nI really think something instructive to the human race may come out of\r\nall this.... Hullo! Is that what you were looking for?”\r\n\r\nThe quadruped Quoodle came in out of the woods a whole minute later than\r\nthe usual time and took his seat beside Humphrey’s left foot with a\r\npreoccupied air.\r\n\r\n“Good old boy,” said the Captain. “You seem to have taken quite a fancy\r\nto us. I doubt, Hump, if he’s properly looked after up at the house. I\r\nparticularly don’t want to talk against Ivywood, Hump. I don’t want his\r\nsoul to be able in all eternity to accuse my soul of a mean detraction.\r\nI want to be fair to him, because I hate him like hell, and he has taken\r\nfrom me all for which I lived. But I don’t think, with all this in my\r\nmind, I don’t think I say anything beyond what he would own himself (for\r\nhis brain is clear) when I say that he could never understand an animal.\r\nAnd so he could never understand the animal side of a man. He doesn’t\r\nknow to this day, Hump, that your sight and hearing are sixty times\r\nquicker than his. He doesn’t know that I have a better circulation. That\r\nexplains the extraordinary people he picks up and acts with; he never\r\nlooks at them as you and I look at that dog. There was a fellow calling\r\nhimself Gluck who was (mainly by Ivywood’s influence, I believe) his\r\ncolleague on the Turkish Conferences, being supposed to represent\r\nGermany. My dear Hump, he was a man that a great gentleman like Ivywood\r\nought not to have touched with a barge-pole. It’s not the race he was—if\r\nit was one race—it’s the Sort he was. A coarse, common, Levantine nark\r\nand eavesdropper—but you mustn’t lose your temper, Hump. I implore you,\r\nHump, to control this tendency to lose your temper when talking at any\r\nlength about such people. Have recourse, Hump, to that consoling system\r\nof versification which I have already explained to you.\r\n\r\n             “Oh I knew a Doctor Gluck,\r\n              And his nose it had a hook,\r\n                And his attitudes were anything but Aryan;\r\n              So I gave him all the pork\r\n              That I had, upon a fork;\r\n                Because I am myself a Vegetarian.”\r\n\r\n“If you are,” said Humphrey Pump, “you’d better come and eat some\r\nvegetables. The White Hat can be eaten cold—or raw, for that matter. But\r\nBloodspots wants some cooking.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, Hump,” said Dalroy, seating himself with every\r\nappearance of speechless greed. “I will be silent. As the poet says—\r\n\r\n               “I am silent in the Club,\r\n                I am silent in the pub,\r\n                  I am silent on a bally peak in Darien;\r\n                For I stuff away for life,\r\n                Shoving peas in with a knife,\r\n                  Because I am at heart a Vegetarian.”\r\n\r\nHe fell to his food with great gusto, dispatched a good deal of it in a\r\nvery short time, threw a glance of gloomy envy at the cask, and then\r\nsprang to his feet again. He caught up the inn-sign from where it leant\r\nagainst the Pantomime Cottage, and planted it like a pike in the ground\r\nbeside him. Then he began to sing again, in an even louder voice than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n              “O, Lord Ivywood may lop,\r\n                 And his privilege is sylvan and riparian;\r\n               And is also free to top,\r\n               But——.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know,” said Hump, also finishing his lunch, “that I’m rather\r\ntired of that particular tune?”\r\n\r\n“Tired, is it?” said the indignant Irishman, “then I’ll sing you a\r\nlonger song, to an even worse tune, about more and more vegetarians, and\r\nyou shall see me dance as well; and I will dance till you burst into\r\ntears and offer me the half of your kingdom; and I shall ask for Mr.\r\nLeveson’s head on the frying-pan. For this, let me tell you, is a song\r\nof oriental origin, celebrating the caprices of an ancient Babylonian\r\nSultan and should be performed in palaces of ivory with palm trees and a\r\nbulbul accompaniment.”\r\n\r\nAnd he began to bellow another and older lyric of his own on\r\nvegetarianism.\r\n\r\n           “Nebuchadnezzar, the King of the Jews,\r\n            Suffered from new and original views,\r\n            He crawled on his hands and knees it’s said,\r\n            With grass in his mouth and a crown on his head,\r\n                 With a wowtyiddly, etc.\r\n\r\n           “Those in traditional paths that trod,\r\n            Thought the thing was a curse from God;\r\n            But a Pioneer men always abuse,\r\n            Like Nebuchadnezzar the King of the Jews.”\r\n\r\nDalroy, as he sang this, actually began to dance about like a ballet\r\ngirl, an enormous and ridiculous figure in the sunlight, waving the\r\nwooden sign around his head. Quoodle opened his eyes and pricked up his\r\nears and seemed much interested in these extraordinary evolutions.\r\nSuddenly, with one of those startling changes that will transfigure the\r\nmost sedentary dogs, Quoodle decided that the dance was a game, and\r\nbegan to bark and bound round the performer, sometimes leaping so far\r\ninto the air as almost to threaten the man’s throat. But, though the\r\nsailor naturally knew less about dogs than the countryman, he knew\r\nenough about them (as about many other things) not to be afraid, and the\r\nvoice he sang with might have drowned the baying of a pack.\r\n\r\n      “Black Lord Foulon the Frenchmen slew,\r\n        Thought it a Futurist thing to do;\r\n       He offered them grass instead of bread,\r\n       So they stuffed him with grass when they cut off his head.\r\n            With a wowtyiddly, etc.\r\n\r\n      “For the pride of his soul he perished then,\r\n       But of course it is always of Pride that men\r\n       A Man in Advance of his Age accuse\r\n       Like Nebuchadnezzar the King of the Jews.\r\n\r\n      “Simeon Scudder of Styx, in Maine,\r\n       Thought of the thing and was at it again;\r\n       He gave good grass and water in pails\r\n       To a thousand Irishmen hammering rails,\r\n            With a wowtyiddly, etc.\r\n\r\n      “Appetites differ, and tied to a stake,\r\n       He was tarred and feathered for Conscience Sake;\r\n       But stoning the prophets is ancient news,\r\n       Like Nebuchadnezzar the King of the Jews.”\r\n\r\nIn an abandon, unusual even for him, he had danced his way down through\r\nthe thistles into the jungle of weeds risen round the sunken Chapel. And\r\nthe dog, now fully convinced that it was not only a game but an\r\nexpedition, perhaps a hunting expedition, ran barking in front of him,\r\nalong the path that his own dog’s paws had already burst through the\r\ntangle. Before Patrick Dalroy well knew what he was doing, or even\r\nremembered that he still carried the ridiculous signboard in his hand,\r\nhe found himself outside the open porch of a sort of narrow tower at the\r\nangle of a building which, to the best of his recollection, he had never\r\nseen before. Quoodle instantly ran up four or five steps in the dark\r\nstaircase inside, and then, lifting his ears again, looked back for his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, such a thing as asking too much of a man. If there\r\nis, it was asking too much of Patrick Dalroy to ask him not to accept so\r\neccentric an invitation. Hurriedly plunging his unwieldy wooden ensign\r\nupright in the thick of thistles and grass, he bent his gigantic neck\r\nand shoulders to enter the porch, and proceeded to climb the stairs. It\r\nwas quite dark, and it was only after at least two twists of the stone\r\nspiral that he saw light ahead of him, and then it was a sort of rent in\r\nthe wall that seemed to him as ragged as the mouth of a Cornish cave. It\r\nwas also so low that he had some difficulty in squeezing his bulk\r\nthrough it, but the dog had jumped through with an air of familiarity,\r\nand once more looked back to see him follow.\r\n\r\nIf he had found himself inside any ordinary domestic interior, he would\r\ninstantly have repented his escapade and gone back. But he found himself\r\nin surroundings which he had never seen before, or even, in one sense,\r\nbelieved possible.\r\n\r\nHis first feeling was that he was walking in the most sealed and secret\r\nsuite of apartments in the castle of a dream. All the chambers had that\r\nair of perpetually opening inwards which is the soul of the Arabian\r\nNights. And the ornament was of the same tradition; gorgeous and\r\nflamboyant, yet featureless and stiff. A purple mansion seemed to be\r\nbuilt inside a green mansion and a golden mansion inside that. And the\r\nquaintly cut doorways or fretted lattices all had wavy lines like a\r\ndancing sea, and for some reason (sea-sickness for all he knew) this\r\ngave him a feeling as if the place were beautiful but faintly evil: as\r\nif it were bored and twisted for the fallen palace of the Worm.\r\n\r\nBut he had also another sensation which he could not analyze; for it\r\nreminded him of being a fly on the ceiling or the wall. Was it the\r\nHanging Gardens of Babylon coming back to his imagination; or the Castle\r\nEast of the Sun and West of the Moon? Then he remembered that in some\r\nboyish illness he had stared at a rather Moorish sort of wall paper,\r\nwhich was like rows and rows of brightly coloured corridors, empty and\r\ngoing on forever. And he remembered that a fly was walking along one of\r\nthe parallel lines; and it seemed to his childish fancy that the\r\ncorridors were all dead in front of the fly, but all came to life as he\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n“By George!” he cried, “I wonder whether that’s the real truth about\r\nEast and West! That the gorgeous East offers everything needed for\r\nadventures except the man to enjoy them. It would explain the tradition\r\nof the Crusades uncommonly well. Perhaps that’s what God meant by Europe\r\nand Asia. We dress the characters and they paint the scenery. Well,\r\nanyhow, three of the least Asiatic things in the world are lost in this\r\nendless Asiatic palace—a good dog, a straight sword, and an Irishman.”\r\n\r\nBut as he went down this telescope of tropical colours he really felt\r\nsomething of that hard fatalistic freedom of the heroes (or should we\r\nsay villains?) in the Arabian Nights. He was prepared for any\r\nimpossibility. He would hardly have been surprised if from under the lid\r\nof one of the porcelain pots standing in a corner had come a serpentine\r\nstring of blue or yellow smoke, as if some wizard’s oil were within. He\r\nwould hardly have been surprised if from under the curtains or closed\r\ndoors had crawled out a snakey track of blood, or if a dumb negro\r\ndressed in white had come out with a bow string, having done his work.\r\nHe would not have been surprised if he had walked suddenly into the\r\nstill chamber of some Sultan asleep, whom to wake was a death in\r\ntorments. And yet he was very much more surprised by what he did see,\r\nand when he saw it, he was certain at last that he was only wandering in\r\nthe labyrinth of his own brain. For what he saw was what was really in\r\nthe core of all his dreams.\r\n\r\nWhat he saw, indeed, was more appropriate to that inmost eastern chamber\r\nthan anything he had imagined. On a divan of blood-red and orange\r\ncushions lay a startlingly beautiful woman, with a skin almost swarthy\r\nenough for an Arab’s, and who might well have been the Princess proper\r\nto such an Arabian tale. But in truth it was not her appropriateness to\r\nthe scene, but rather her inappropriateness, that made his heart bound.\r\nIt was not her strangeness but her familiarity that made his big feet\r\nsuddenly stop.\r\n\r\nThe dog ran on yet more rapidly, and the princess on the sofa welcomed\r\nhim warmly, lifting him on his short hind legs. Then she looked up, and\r\nseemed turned to stone.\r\n\r\n“Bismillah,” said the oriental traveller, affably, “may your shadow\r\nnever grow less—or more, as the ladies would say. The Commander of the\r\nFaithful has deputed his least competent slave to bring you back a dog.\r\nOwing to temporary delay in collecting the fifteen largest diamonds in\r\nthe moon, he has been compelled to send the animal without any collar.\r\nThose responsible for the delay will instantly be beaten to death with\r\nthe tails of dragons—”\r\n\r\nThe frightful shock, which had not yet left the lady’s face, brought him\r\nback to responsible speech.\r\n\r\n“In short,” he said, “in the name of the Prophet, dog. I say, Joan, I\r\nwish this wasn’t a dream.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t,” said the girl, speaking for the first time, “and I don’t\r\nknow yet whether I wish it was.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” argued the dreamer, rationally, “what are you, anytime, if\r\nyou’re not a dream—or a vision? And what are all these rooms, if they\r\naren’t a dream—or rather a nightmare?”\r\n\r\n“This is the new wing of Ivywood House,” said the lady addressed as\r\nJoan, speaking with great difficulty. “Lord Ivywood has fitted them up\r\nin the eastern style; he is inside conducting a most interesting debate\r\nin defence of Eastern Vegetarianism. I only came out because the room\r\nwas rather hot.”\r\n\r\n“Vegetarian!” cried Dalroy, with abrupt and rather unreasonable\r\nexasperation. “That table seems to fall a bit short of Vegetarianism.”\r\nAnd he pointed to one of the long, narrow tables, laid somewhere in\r\nalmost all the central rooms, and loaded with elaborate cold meats and\r\nexpensive wines.\r\n\r\n“He must be liberal-minded,” cried Joan, who seemed to be on the verge\r\nof something, possibly temper. “He can’t expect people suddenly to begin\r\nbeing Vegetarians when they’ve never been before.”\r\n\r\n“It has been done,” said Dalroy, tranquilly, walking across to look at\r\nthe table. “I say, your ascetical friends seem to have made a pretty\r\ngood hole in the champagne. You may not believe it, Joan, but I haven’t\r\ntouched what you call alcohol for a month.”\r\n\r\nWith which words he filled with champagne a large tumbler intended for\r\nclaret cup and swallowed it at a draught.\r\n\r\nLady Joan Brett stood up straight but trembling.\r\n\r\n“Now that’s really wrong, Pat,” she cried. “Oh, don’t be silly—you know\r\nI don’t care about the alcohol or all that. But you’re in the man’s\r\nhouse, uninvited, and he doesn’t know. That wasn’t like you.”\r\n\r\n“He shall know, all right,” said the large man, quietly. “I know the\r\nexact price of a tumbler of that champagne.”\r\n\r\nAnd he scribbled some words in pencil on the back of a bill of fare on\r\nthe table, and then carefully laid three shillings on top of it.\r\n\r\n“And there you do Phillip the worst wrong of all,” cried Lady Joan,\r\nflaming white. “You know as well as I do, anyhow, that he would not take\r\nyour money.”\r\n\r\nPatrick Dalroy stood looking at her for some seconds with an expression\r\non his broad and unusually open face which she found utterly puzzling.\r\n\r\n“Curiously enough,” he observed, at last, and with absolutely even\r\ntemper, “curiously enough, it is you who are doing Phillip Ivywood a\r\nwrong. I think him quite capable of breaking England or Creation. But I\r\ndo honestly think he would never break his word. And what is more, I\r\nthink the more arbitrary and literal his word had been, the more he\r\nwould keep it. You will never understand a man like that, till you\r\nunderstand that he can have devotion to a definition; even a new\r\ndefinition. He can really feel about an amendment to an Act of\r\nParliament, inserted at the last moment, as you feel about England or\r\nyour mother.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t philosophise,” cried Joan suddenly. “Can’t you see this has\r\nbeen a shock?”\r\n\r\n“I only want you to see the point,” he replied. “Lord Ivywood clearly\r\ntold me, with his own careful lips, that I might go in and pay for\r\nfermented liquor in any place displaying a public sign outside. And he\r\nwon’t go back on that definition or on any definition. If he finds me\r\nhere, he may quite possibly put me in prison on some other charge, as a\r\nthief or a vagabond, or what not. But he will not grudge the champagne.\r\nAnd he will accept the three shillings. And I shall honour him for his\r\nglorious consistency.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand,” said Joan, “one word of what you are talking\r\nabout. Which way did you come? How can I get you away? You don’t seem to\r\ngrasp that you’re in Ivywood House.”\r\n\r\n“You see there’s a new name outside the gate,” observed Patrick,\r\nconversationally, and led the lady to the end of the corridor by which\r\nhe had entered and into its ultimate turret chamber.\r\n\r\nFollowing his indications, Lady Joan peered a little over the edge of\r\nthe window where hung the brilliant purple bird in its brilliant golden\r\ncage. Almost immediately below, outside the entrance to the half-closed\r\nstairway, stood a wooden tavern sign, as solid and still as if it had\r\nbeen there for centuries.\r\n\r\n“All back at the sign of ‘The Old Ship,’ you see,” said the Captain.\r\n“Can I offer you anything in a ladylike way?”\r\n\r\nThere was a vast impudence in the slight, hospitable movement of his\r\nhand, that disturbed Lady Joan’s features with an emotion other than any\r\nthat she desired to show.\r\n\r\n“Well!” cried Patrick, with a wild geniality, “I’ve made you laugh\r\nagain, my dear.”\r\n\r\nHe caught her to him as in a whirlwind, and then vanished from the fairy\r\nturret like a blast, leaving her standing with her hand up to her wild\r\nblack hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                        THE BATTLE OF THE TUNNEL\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT Joan Brett really felt, as she went back from the second\r\ntête-à-tête she had experienced in the turret, it is doubtful if anyone\r\nwill ever know. But she was full of the pungent feminine instinct to\r\n“drive at practice,” and what she did clearly realise was the pencil\r\nwriting Dalroy had left on the back of Lord Ivywood’s _menu_. Heaven\r\nalone knew what it was, and (as it pleased her profane temper to tell\r\nherself) she was not satisfied with Heaven alone knowing. She went\r\nswiftly back, with swishing skirts, to the table where it had been left.\r\nBut her skirts fell more softly and her feet trailed slower and more in\r\nher usual manner as she came near the table. For standing at it was Lord\r\nIvywood, reading the card with tranquil lowered eyelids, that set off\r\nperfectly the long and perfect oval of his face. He put down the card\r\nwith a quite natural action; and, seeing Joan, smiled at her in his most\r\nsympathetic way.\r\n\r\n“So you’ve come out too,” he said. “So have I; it’s really too hot for\r\nanything. Dr. Gluck is making an uncommonly good speech, but I couldn’t\r\nstop even for that. Don’t you think my eastern decorations are rather a\r\nsuccess after all? A sort of Vegetarianism in design, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\nHe led her up and down the corridors, pointing out lemon-coloured\r\ncrescents or crimson pomegranates in the scheme of ornament, with such\r\nutter detachment that they twice passed the open mouth of the hall of\r\ndebate, and Joan could distinctly hear the voice of the diplomatic Gluck\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n“Indeed, we owe our knowledge of the pollution of the pork primarily to\r\nthe Jewth and not the Mothlemth. I do not thare that prejudithe against\r\nthe Jewth, which ith too common in my family and all the arithtocratic\r\nand military Prutthian familieth. I think we Prutthian arithocrats owe\r\neverything to the Jewth. The Jewth have given to our old Teutonic rugged\r\nvirtueth, jutht that touch of refinement, jutht that intellectual\r\nthuperiority which——.”\r\n\r\nAnd then the voice would die away behind, as Lord Ivywood lectured\r\nluxuriantly, and very well, on the peacock tail in decoration, or some\r\nmore extravagant eastern version of the Greek Key. But the third time\r\nthey turned, they heard the noise of subdued applause and the breaking\r\nup the meeting; and people came pouring forth.\r\n\r\nWith stillness and swiftness, Ivywood pitched on the people he wanted\r\nand held them. He button-holed Leveson and was evidently asking him to\r\ndo something which neither of the two liked doing.\r\n\r\n“If your lordship insists,” she heard Leveson whispering, “of course I\r\nwill go myself; but there is a great deal to be done here with your\r\nlordship’s immediate matters. And if there were anyone else——.”\r\n\r\nIf Phillip, Lord Ivywood, had ever looked at a human being in his life,\r\nhe would have seen that J. Leveson, Secretary, was suffering from a very\r\nancient human malady, excusable in all men and rather more excusable in\r\none who has had his top-hat smashed over his eyes and has run for his\r\nlife. As it was, he saw nothing, but merely said, “Oh, well, get someone\r\nelse. What about your friend Hibbs?”\r\n\r\nLeveson ran across to Hibbs, who was drinking another glass of champagne\r\nat one of the innumerable buffets.\r\n\r\n“Hibbs,” said Leveson, rather nervously, “will you do Lord Ivywood a\r\nfavour? He says you have so much tact. It seems possible that a man may\r\nbe hanging about the grounds just below that turret there. He is a man\r\nit would certainly be Lord Ivywood’s public duty to put into the hands\r\nof the police, if he is there. But then, again, he is quite capable of\r\nnot being there at all—I mean of having sent his message from somewhere\r\nelse and in some other way. Naturally, Lord Ivywood doesn’t want to\r\nalarm the ladies and perhaps turn the laugh against himself, by getting\r\nup a sort of police raid about nothing. He wants some sensible, tactful\r\nfriend of his to go down and look round the place—it’s a sort of disused\r\ngarden—and report if there’s anyone about. I’d go myself, but I’m wanted\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nHibbs nodded, and filled another glass.\r\n\r\n“But there’s a further difficulty,” went on Leveson. “He’s a clever\r\nbrute, it seems, a ‘remarkable and a dangerous man,’ were his lordship’s\r\nwords; and it looks as if he’d spotted a very good hiding-place, a\r\ndisused tunnel leading to the sands, just beyond the disused garden and\r\nchapel. It’s a smart choice, you see, for he can bolt into the woods if\r\nanyone comes from the shore, or on to the shore if anyone comes from the\r\nwoods. But it would take a good time even to get the police here, and it\r\nwould take ten times longer to get ’em round to the sea end of the\r\ntunnel, especially as the sea comes up to the cliffs once or twice\r\nbetween here and Pebblewick. So we mustn’t frighten him away, or he’ll\r\nget a start. If you meet anyone down there talk to him quite naturally,\r\nand come back with the news. We won’t send for the police till you come.\r\nTalk as if you were just wandering like himself. His lordship wishes\r\nyour presence to appear quite accidental.”\r\n\r\n“Wishes my presence to appear quite accidental,” repeated Hibbs,\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\nWhen the feverish Leveson had flashed off satisfied, Hibbs took a glass\r\nor two more of wine; feeling that he was going on a great diplomatic\r\nmission to please a lord. Then he went through the opening, picked his\r\nway down the stair, and somehow found his way out into the neglected\r\ngarden and shrubbery.\r\n\r\nIt was already evening, and an early moon was brightening over the\r\nsunken chapel with its dragon-coloured scales of fungus. The night\r\nbreeze was very fresh and had a marked effect on Mr. Hibbs. He found\r\nhimself taking a meaningless pleasure in the scene; especially in one\r\nfungus that was white with brown spots. He laughed shortly, to think\r\nthat it should be white with brown spots. Then he said, with carefully\r\naccurate articulation, “His lordship wishes my presence to appear quite\r\naccidental.” Then he tried to remember something else that Leveson had\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHe began to wade through the waves of weed and thorn past the Chapel,\r\nbut he found the soil much more uneven and obstructive than he had\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nHe slipped, and sought to save himself by throwing one arm round a\r\nbroken stone angel at a corner of the heap of Gothic fragments; but it\r\nwas loose and rocked in its socket.\r\n\r\nMr. Hibbs presented for a moment the appearance of waltzing with the\r\nAngel in the moonlight, in a very amorous and irreverent manner. Then\r\nthe statue rolled over one way and he rolled over the other, and lay on\r\nhis face in the grass, making inaudible remarks. He might have lain\r\nthere for some time, or at least found some difficulty in rising, but\r\nfor another circumstance. The dog Quoodle, with characteristic\r\nofficiousness, had followed him down the dark stairs and out of the\r\ndoorway, and, finding him in this unusual posture, began to bark as if\r\nthe house were on fire.\r\n\r\nThis brought a heavy human footstep from the more hidden parts of the\r\ncopse; and in a minute or two the large man with the red hair was\r\nlooking down at him in undisguised wonder. Hibbs said, in a muffled\r\nvoice which came obscurely from under his hidden face, “Wish my presence\r\nto appear quite accidental.”\r\n\r\n“It does,” said the Captain, “can I help you up? Are you hurt?”\r\n\r\nHe gently set the prostrate gentleman on his feet, and looked genuinely\r\nconcerned. The fall had somewhat sobered Lord Ivywood’s representative;\r\nand he really had a red graze on the left cheek that looked more ugly\r\nthan it was.\r\n\r\n“I am so sorry,” said Patrick Dalroy, cordially, “come and sit down in\r\nour camp. My friend Pump will be back presently, and he’s a capital\r\ndoctor.”\r\n\r\nHis friend Pump may or may not have been a capital doctor, but the\r\nCaptain himself was certainly a most inefficient one. So small was his\r\ntalent for diagnosing the nature of a disease at sight, that having\r\ngiven Mr. Hibbs a seat on a fallen tree by the tunnel, he proceeded to\r\ngive him (in mere automatic hospitality) a glass of rum.\r\n\r\nMr. Hibbs’s eyes awoke again, when he had sipped it, but they awoke to a\r\nnew world.\r\n\r\n“Wharever may be our invidual pinions,” he said, and looked into space\r\nwith an expression of humorous sagacity.\r\n\r\nHe then put his hand hazily in his pocket, as if to find some letter he\r\nhad to deliver. He found nothing but his old journalistic note book,\r\nwhich he often carried when there was a chance of interviewing anybody.\r\nThe feel of it under his fingers changed the whole attitude of his mind.\r\nHe took it out and said:\r\n\r\n“And wha’ would you say of Vegetarianism, Colonel Pump?”\r\n\r\n“I think it palls,” replied the recipient of this complex title,\r\nstaring.\r\n\r\n“Sha’ we say,” asked Hibbs brightly, turning a leaf in his note book,\r\n“sha’ we say long been strong vegetarian by conviction?”\r\n\r\n“No; I have only once been convicted,” answered Dalroy, with restraint,\r\n“and I hope to lead a better life when I come out.”\r\n\r\n“Hopes lead better life,” murmured Hibbs, writing eagerly, with the\r\nwrong end of his pencil. “And wha’ would you shay was best vegable food\r\nfor really strong veg’tarian by conviction?”\r\n\r\n“Thistles,” said the Captain, wearily. “But I don’t know much about it,\r\nyou know.”\r\n\r\n“Lord Ivywoo’ strong veg’tarian by conviction,” said Mr. Hibbs, shaking\r\nhis head with unction. “Lord Ivywoo’ says tact. Talk to him naturally.\r\nAnd so I do. That’s what I do. Talk to him naturally.”\r\n\r\nHumphrey Pump came through the clearer part of the wood, leading the\r\ndonkey, who had just partaken of the diet recommended to a vegetarian by\r\nconviction; the dog sprang up and ran to them. Pump was, perhaps, the\r\nmost naturally polite man in the world, and said nothing. But his eyes\r\nhad accepted, with one snap of surprise, the other fact, also not\r\nunconnected with diet, which had escaped Dalroy’s notice when he\r\nadministered rum as a restorative.\r\n\r\n“Lord Ivywoo’ says,” murmured the journalistic diplomatist. “Lord\r\nIvywoo’ says, ‘talk as if you were just wandering.’ That’s it. That’s\r\ntact. That’s what I’ve got to do—talk as if I was just wandering. Long\r\nway round to other end tunnel; sea and cliffs. Don’ sphose they can\r\nswim.” He seized his note book again and looked in vain for his pencil.\r\n“Good subjec’ correspondence. Can policem’n swim?”\r\n\r\n“Policemen?” said Dalroy, in a dead silence. The dog looked up, and the\r\ninnkeeper did not.\r\n\r\n“Get to Ivywoo’ one thing,” reasoned the diplomatist. “Get policemen\r\nbeach other end other thing. No good do one thing no’ do other thing, no\r\ngoo’ do other thing no’ do other thing. Wish my presence appear quite\r\naccidental. Haw!”\r\n\r\n“I’ll harness the donkey,” said Pump.\r\n\r\n“Will he go through that door?” asked Dalroy, with a gesture toward the\r\nentrance of the rough boarding with which they had faced the tunnel, “or\r\nshall I smash it all at once?”\r\n\r\n“He’ll go through all right,” answered Pump. “I saw to that when I made\r\nit. And I think I’ll get him to the safe end of the tunnel before I load\r\nhim up. The best thing you can do is to pull up one of those saplings to\r\nbar the door with. That’ll delay them a minute or two; though I think\r\nwe’ve got warning in pretty easy time.”\r\n\r\nHe led his donkey to the cart, and carefully harnessed the donkey; like\r\nall men cunning in the old healthy sense he knew that the last chance of\r\nleisure ought to be leisurely, in order that it may be lucid. Then he\r\nled the whole equipment through the temporary wooden door of the tunnel,\r\nthe inquisitive Quoodle, of course, following at his heels.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me if I take a tree,” said Dalroy, politely, to his guest, like\r\na man reaching across another man for a match. And with that he rent up\r\na young tree by its roots, as he had done in the Island of the Olives,\r\nand carried it on his shoulder, like the club of Hercules.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUp in Ivywood House Lord Ivywood had telephoned twice to Pebblewick. It\r\nwas a delay he seldom suffered; and, though he never expressed\r\nimpatience in unnecessary words he expressed it in unnecessary walking.\r\nHe would not yet send for the police without news from his Ambassador,\r\nbut he thought a preliminary conversation with some police authorities\r\nhe knew well, might advance matters. Seeing Leveson rather shrunk in a\r\ncorner, he wheeled round in his walk and said abruptly:\r\n\r\n“You must go and see what has happened to Hibbs. If you have any other\r\nduties here, I authorize you to neglect them. Otherwise, I can only\r\nsay——”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the telephone rang, and the impatient nobleman rushed for\r\nhis delayed call with a rapidity he seldom showed. There was simply\r\nnothing for Leveson to do except to do as he was told, or be sacked. He\r\nwalked swiftly toward the staircase, and only stopped once at the table\r\nwhere Hibbs had stood and gulped down two goblets of the same wine. But\r\nlet no man attribute to Mr. Leveson the loose and luxurious social\r\nmotives of Mr. Hibbs. Mr. Leveson did not drink for pleasure; in fact,\r\nhe hardly knew what he was drinking. His motive was something far more\r\nsimple and sincere; a sentiment forcibly described in legal phraseology\r\nas going in bodily fear.\r\n\r\nHe was partly nerved, but by no means reconciled to his adventure, when\r\nhe crept carefully down the stairs and peered about the thicket for any\r\nsigns of his diplomatic friend. He could find neither sight nor sound to\r\nguide him, except a sort of distant singing, which greatly increased in\r\nvolume of sound as he pursued it. The first words he heard seemed to run\r\nsomething like—\r\n\r\n           “No more the milk of cows\r\n            Shall pollute my private house,\r\n            Than the milk of the wild mares of the Barbarian;\r\n            I will stick to port and sherry,\r\n            For they are so very, very,\r\n            So very, very, very Vegetarian.\r\n\r\nLeveson did not know the huge and horrible voice in which these words\r\nwere shouted, but he had a most strange and even sickening suspicion\r\nthat he did know the voice, however altered, the quavering and rather\r\nrefined voice that joined in the chorus and sang,\r\n\r\n                   “Because they are so vegy,\r\n                    So vegy, vegy, vegy Vegetarian.”\r\n\r\nTerror lit up his wits, and he made a wild guess at what had happened.\r\nWith a gasp of relief he realised that he had now good excuse for\r\nreturning to the house with the warning. He ran there like a hare, still\r\nhearing the great voice from the woods like the roaring of a lion in his\r\near.\r\n\r\nHe found Lord Ivywood in consultation with Dr. Gluck, and also with Mr.\r\nBullrose the Agent, whose froglike eyes hardly seemed to have recovered\r\nyet from the fairy-tale of the flying sign-board in the English lane;\r\nbut who, to do him justice, was more plucky and practical than most of\r\nLord Ivywood’s present advisers.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid Mr. Hibbs has inadvertently,” stammered Leveson. “I’m afraid\r\nhe has—I’m afraid the man is making his escape, my lord. You had better\r\nsend for the police.”\r\n\r\nIvywood turned to the agent. “You go and see what’s happening,” he said\r\nsimply. “I will come myself when I’ve rung them up. And get some of the\r\nservants up with sticks and things. Fortunately the ladies have gone to\r\nbed. Hullo! Is that the Police Station?”\r\n\r\nBullrose went down into the shrubbery and had, for many reasons, less\r\ndifficulty in crossing it than the hilarious Hibbs. The moon had\r\nincreased to an almost unnatural brilliancy, so that the whole scene was\r\nlike a rather silver daylight; and in this clear medium he beheld a very\r\ntall man with erect, red hair and a colossal cylinder of cheese carried\r\nunder one arm, while he employed the other to wag a big forefinger at a\r\ndog with whom he was conversing.\r\n\r\nIt was the Agent’s duty and desire to hold the man, whom he recognised\r\nfrom the sign-board mystery, in play and conversation, and prevent his\r\nfinal escape. But there are some people who really cannot be courteous,\r\neven when they want to be, and Mr. Bullrose was one of them.\r\n\r\n“Lord Ivywood,” he said abruptly, “wants to know what you want.”\r\n\r\n“Do not, however, fall into the common error, Quoodle,” Dalroy was\r\nsaying to the dog, whose unfathomable eyes were fixed on his face, “of\r\nsupposing that the phrase ‘good dog’ is used in its absolute sense. A\r\ndog is good or bad negatively to a limited scheme of duties created by\r\nhuman civilization——”\r\n\r\n“What are you doing here?” asked Mr. Bullrose.\r\n\r\n“A dog, my dear Quoodle,” continued the Captain, “cannot be either so\r\ngood or bad as a man. Nay, I should go farther. I would almost say a dog\r\ncannot be so stupid as a man. He cannot be utterly wanting as a dog—as\r\nsome men are as men.”\r\n\r\n“Answer me, you there!” roared the Agent.\r\n\r\n“It is all the more pathetic,” continued the Captain, to whose monologue\r\nQuoodle seemed to listen with magnetized attention. “It is all the more\r\npathetic because this mental insufficiency is sometimes found in the\r\ngood; though there are, I should imagine, at least an equal number of\r\nopposite examples. The person standing a few feet off us, for example,\r\nis both stupid and wicked. But be very careful, Quoodle, to remember\r\nthat any disadvantage under which we place him should be based on the\r\n_moral_ and not his _mental_ defects. Should I say to you at any time,\r\n‘Go for him, Quoodle,’ or ‘Hold him, Quoodle,’ be certain in your own\r\nmind, please, that it is solely because he is _wicked_ and not because\r\nhe is _stupid_, that I am entitled to do so. The fact that he is\r\n_stupid_ would not justify me in saying ‘hold him, Quoodle,’ with the\r\nrealistic intonation I now employ——”\r\n\r\n“Curse you, call him off!” cried Mr. Bullrose, retreating, for Quoodle\r\nwas coming toward him with the bulldog part of his pedigree very\r\nprominently displayed, like a pennon. “Should Mr. Bullrose find it\r\nexpedient to climb a tree, or even a sign-post,” proceeded Dalroy, for\r\nindeed the Agent had already clasped the pole of “The Old Ship,” which\r\nwas stouter than the slender trees standing just around it, “you will\r\nkeep an eye on him, Quoodle, and, I doubt not, constantly remind him\r\nthat it is his _wickedness_, and not, as he might hastily be inclined to\r\nsuppose, _stupidity_ that has placed him on so conspicuous an\r\nelevation——”\r\n\r\n“Some of you’ll wish yourself dead for this,” said the Agent; who was by\r\nthis time clinging to the wooden sign like a monkey on a stick, while\r\nQuoodle watched him from below with an unsated interest. “Some of you’ll\r\nsee something. Here comes his lordship and the police, I reckon.”\r\n\r\n“Good morning, my lord,” said Dalroy, as Ivywood, paler than ever in the\r\nstrong moonshine, came through the thicket toward them. It seemed to be\r\nhis fate that his faultless and hueless face should always be contrasted\r\nwith richer colours; and even now it was thrown up by the gorgeous\r\ndiplomatic uniform of Dr. Gluck, who walked just behind him.\r\n\r\n“I am glad to see you, my lord,” said Dalroy, in a stately manner, “it\r\nis always so awkward doing business with an Agent. Especially for the\r\nAgent.”\r\n\r\n“Captain Dalroy,” said Lord Ivywood, with a more serious dignity, “I am\r\nsorry we meet again like this, and such things are not of my seeking. It\r\nis only right to tell you that the police will be here in a moment.”\r\n\r\n“Quite time, too!” said Dalroy, shaking his head. “I never saw anything\r\nso disgraceful in my life. Of course, I am sorry it’s a friend of yours;\r\nand I hope the police will keep Ivywood House out of the papers. But I\r\nwon’t be a party to one law for the rich and another for the poor, and\r\nit would be a great shame if a man in that state got off altogether\r\nmerely because he had got the stuff at your house.”\r\n\r\n“I do not understand you,” said Ivywood. “What are you talking of?”\r\n\r\n“Why of him,” replied the Captain, with a genial gesture toward a fallen\r\ntree trunk that lay a yard or two from the tunnel wall, “the poor chap\r\nthe police are coming for.”\r\n\r\nLord Ivywood looked at the forest log by the tunnel which he had not\r\nglanced at before, and in his pale eyes, perhaps for the first time,\r\nstood a simple astonishment.\r\n\r\nAbove the log appeared two duplicate objects, which, after a prolonged\r\nstare, he identified as the soles of a pair of patent leather shoes,\r\noffered to his gaze, as if demanding his opinion in the matter of\r\nresoling. They were all that was visible of Mr. Hibbs who had fallen\r\nbackward off his woodland seat and seemed contented with his new\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nHis lordship put up the pince-nez that made him look ten years older,\r\nand said with a sharp, steely accent, “What is all this?”\r\n\r\nThe only effect of his voice upon the faithful Hibbs was to cause him to\r\nfeebly wave his legs in the air in recognition of a feudal superior. He\r\nclearly considered it hopeless to attempt to get up, so Dalroy, striding\r\nacross to him, lugged him up by his shirt collar and exhibited him, limp\r\nand wild-eyed to the company.\r\n\r\n“You won’t want many policemen to take him to the station,” said the\r\nCaptain. “I’m sorry, Lord Ivywood, I’m afraid it’s no use your asking me\r\nto overlook it again. We can’t afford it,” and he shook his head\r\nimplacably. “We’ve always kept a respectable house, Mr. Pump and I. ‘The\r\nOld Ship’ has a reputation all over the country—in quite a lot of\r\ndifferent parts, in fact. People in the oddest places have found it a\r\nquiet, family house. Nothing gadabout in ‘The Old Ship.’ And if you\r\nthink you can send all your staggering revellers——”\r\n\r\n“Captain Dalroy,” said Ivywood, simply, “you seem to be under a\r\nmisapprehension, which I think it would be hardly honourable to leave\r\nundisturbed. Whatever these extraordinary events may mean and whatever\r\nbe fitting in the case of this gentleman, when I spoke of the police\r\ncoming, I meant they were coming for you and your confederate.”\r\n\r\n“For me!” cried the Captain, with a stupendous air of surprise. “Why, I\r\nhave never done anything naughty in my life.”\r\n\r\n“You have been selling alcohol contrary to Clause V. of the Act of——”\r\n\r\n“But I’ve got a sign,” cried Dalroy, excitedly, “you told me yourself it\r\nwas all right if I’d got a sign. Oh, do look at our new sign! The ‘Sign\r\nof the Agile Agent.’”\r\n\r\nMr. Bullrose had remained silent, feeling his position none of the most\r\ndignified, and hoping his employer would go away. But Lord Ivywood\r\nlooked up at him, and thought he had wandered into a planet of monsters.\r\n\r\nAs he slowly recovered himself Patrick Dalroy said briskly, “All quite\r\ncorrect and conventional, you see. You can’t run us in for not having a\r\nsign; we’ve rather an extra life-like one. And you can’t run us in as\r\nrogues and vagabonds either. Visible means of subsistence,” and he\r\nslapped the huge cheese under his arm with his great flat hand, so that\r\nit reverberated like a drum. “Quite visible. Perceptible,” he added,\r\nholding it out suddenly almost under Lord Ivywood’s nose. “Perceptible\r\nto the naked eye through your lordship’s eyeglasses.”\r\n\r\nHe turned abruptly, burst open the pantomime door behind him and bowled\r\nthe big cheese down the tunnel with a noise like thunder, which ended in\r\na cry of acceptation in the distant voice of Mr. Humphrey Pump. It was\r\nthe last of their belongings left at this end of the tunnel, and Dalroy\r\nturned again, a man totally transfigured.\r\n\r\n“And now, Ivywood,” he said, “what can I be charged with? Well, I have a\r\nsuggestion to make. I will surrender to the police quite quietly when\r\nthey come, if you will do me one favour. Let me choose my crime.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand you,” answered the other coolly, “what crime? What\r\nfavour?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Dalroy unsheathed the straight sword that still hung on his now\r\nshabby uniform. The slender blade sparkled splendidly in the moonlight\r\nas he pointed it straight at Dr. Gluck.\r\n\r\n“Take away his sword from the little pawnbroker,” he said. “It’s about\r\nthe length of mine; or we’ll change if you like. Give me ten minutes on\r\nthat strip of turf. And then it may be, Ivywood, that I shall be removed\r\nfrom your public path in a way a little worthier of enemies who have\r\nonce been friends, than if you tripped me up with Bow Street runners, of\r\nwhose help every ancestor you have would have been ashamed. Or, on the\r\nother hand, it may be—that when the police come there will be something\r\nto arrest me for.”\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, and the elf of irresponsibility peeped out\r\nagain for an instant in Dalroy’s mind.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bullrose will see fair play for you, from a throne above the\r\nlists,” he said. “I have already put my honour in the hands of Mr.\r\nHibbs.”\r\n\r\n“I must decline Captain Dalroy’s invitation,” said Ivywood at last, in a\r\ncurious tone. “Not so much because——”\r\n\r\nBefore he could proceed, Leveson came racing across the copse,\r\nhallooing, “The police are here!”\r\n\r\nDalroy, who loved leaving everything to the last instant, tore up the\r\nsign, with Bullrose literally hanging to it, shook him off like a ripe\r\nfruit, and then plunged into the tunnel, the clamorous Quoodle at his\r\nheels. Before even Ivywood (the promptest of his party) could reach the\r\nspot, he had clashed to the wood door and bolted it across with his\r\nwooden staple. He had not had time even to sheath his sword.\r\n\r\n“Break down this door,” said Lord Ivywood, calmly. “I noticed they\r\nhaven’t finished loading their cart.”\r\n\r\nUnder his directions, and vastly against their will, Bullrose and\r\nLeveson lifted the tree-trunk vacated by Hibbs, and swinging it thrice\r\nas a battering-ram, burst in the door. Lord Ivywood instantly sprang\r\ninto the entrance.\r\n\r\nA voice called out to him quietly from the other end of the tunnel.\r\nThere was something touching and yet terrible about a voice so human\r\ncoming out of that inhuman darkness. If Phillip Ivywood had been really\r\na poet, and not rather its opposite, an æsthete, he would have known\r\nthat all the past and people of England were uttering their oracle out\r\nof the cavern. As it was, he only heard a publican wanted by the\r\npolice.—Yet even he paused, and indeed seemed spellbound.\r\n\r\n“My lord, I would like a word. I learned my catechism and never was with\r\nthe Radicals. I want you to look at what you’ve done to me. You’ve\r\nstolen a house that was mine as that one’s yours. You’ve made me a dirty\r\ntramp, that was a man respected in church and market. Now you send me\r\nwhere I might have cells or the Cat. If I might make so bold, what do\r\nyou suppose I think of you? Do you think because you go up to London and\r\nsettle it with lords in Parliament and bring back a lot of papers and\r\nlong words, that makes any difference to the man you do it to? By what I\r\ncan see, you’re just a bad and cruel master, like those God punished in\r\nthe old days; like Squire Varney the weasels killed in Holy Wood. Well,\r\nparson always said one might shoot at robbers, and I want to tell your\r\nlordship,” he ended respectfully, “that I have a gun.”\r\n\r\nIvywood instantly stepped into the darkness, and spoke in a voice shaken\r\nwith some emotion, the nature of which was never certainly known.\r\n\r\n“The police are here,” he said, “but I’ll arrest you myself.”\r\n\r\nA shot shrieked and rattled through the thousand echoes of the tunnel.\r\nLord Ivywood’s legs doubled and twisted under him, and he collapsed on\r\nthe earth with a bullet above his knee.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same instant a shout and a bark announced that the cart\r\nhad started as a complete equipage. It was even more than complete, for\r\nthe instant before it moved Mr. Quoodle had sprung into it, and, as it\r\nwas driven off, sat erect in it, looking solemn.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                     THE CREATURE THAT MAN FORGETS\r\n\r\n\r\nDESPITE the natural hubbub round the wound of Lord Ivywood and the\r\ndifficulties of the police in finding their way to the shore, the\r\nfugitives of the Flying Inn must almost certainly have been captured but\r\nfor a curious accident, which also flowed, as it happened, from the\r\ngreat Ivywood debate on Vegetarianism.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively late hour at which Lord Ivywood had made his discovery\r\nhad been largely due to a very long speech which Joan had not heard, and\r\nwhich was delivered immediately before the few concluding observations\r\nshe had heard from Dr. Gluck. The speech was made by an eccentric, of\r\ncourse. Most of those who attended, and nearly all of those who talked,\r\nwere eccentric in one way or another. But he was an eccentric of great\r\nwealth and good family, an M.P., a J.P., a relation of Lady Enid, a man\r\nwell known in art and letters; in short, a personality who could not be\r\nprevented from being anything he chose, from a revolutionist to a bore.\r\nDorian Wimpole had first become famous outside his own class under the\r\nfanciful title of the Poet of the Birds. A volume of verse, expanding\r\nthe several notes or cries of separate song-birds into fantastic\r\nsoliloquies of these feathered philosophers, had really contained a\r\ngreat deal of ingenuity and elegance. Unfortunately, he was one of those\r\nwho always tend to take their own fancies seriously, and in whose\r\notherwise legitimate extravagance there is too little of the juice of\r\njest. Hence, in his later works, when he explained “The Fable of the\r\nAngel,” by trying to prove that the fowls of the air were creatures\r\nhigher than man or the anthropoids, his manner was felt to be too\r\naustere; and when he moved an amendment to Lord Ivywood’s scheme for the\r\nmodel village called Peaceways, urging that its houses should all follow\r\nthe more hygienic architecture of nests hung in trees, many regretted\r\nthat he had lost his light touch. But, when he went beyond birds and\r\nfilled his poems with conjectural psychology about all the Zoological\r\nGardens, his meaning became obscure; and Lady Susan had even described\r\nit as his bad period. It was all the more uncomfortable reading because\r\nhe poured forth the imaginary hymns, love-songs and war-songs of the\r\nlower animals, without a word of previous explanation. Thus, if someone\r\nseeking for an ordinary drawing-room song came on lines that were headed\r\n“A Desert Love Song,” and which began—\r\n\r\n                  “Her head is high against the stars,\r\n                   Her hump is heaved in pride,”\r\n\r\nthe compliment to the lady would at first seem startling, until the\r\nreader realised that all the characters in the idyll were camels. Or, if\r\nhe began a poem simply entitled, “The March of Democracy,” and found in\r\nthe first lines—\r\n\r\n                  “Comrades, marching evermore,\r\n                   Fix your teeth in floor and door,”\r\n\r\nhe might be doubtful about such a policy for the masses; until he\r\ndiscovered that it was supposed to be addressed by an eloquent and\r\naspiring rat to the social solidarity of his race. Lord Ivywood had\r\nnearly quarrelled with his poetic relative over the uproarious realism\r\nof the verses called “A Drinking Song,” until it was carefully explained\r\nto him that the drink was water, and that the festive company consisted\r\nof bisons. His vision of the perfect husband, as it exists in the\r\nfeelings of the young female walrus, is thoughtful and suggestive; but\r\nwould doubtless receive many emendations from anyone who had experienced\r\nthose feelings. And in his sonnet called “Motherhood” he has made the\r\nyoung scorpion consistent and convincing, yet somehow not wholly\r\nlovable. In justice to him, however, it should be remembered that he\r\nattacked the most difficult cases on principle, declaring that there was\r\nno earthly creature that a poet should forget.\r\n\r\nHe was of the blond type of his cousin, with flowing fair hair and\r\nmustache, and a bright blue, absent-minded eye; he was very well dressed\r\nin the carefully careless manner, with a brown velvet jacket and the\r\nimage on his ring of one of those beasts men worshipped in Egypt.\r\n\r\nHis speech was graceful and well worded and enormously long, and it was\r\nall about an oyster. He passionately protested against the suggestion of\r\nsome humanitarians who were vegetarians in other respects, but\r\nmaintained that organisms so simple might fairly be counted as\r\nexceptions. Man, he said, even at his miserable best, was always trying\r\nto excommunicate some one citizen of the cosmos, to forget some one\r\ncreature that he should remember. Now, it seemed that creature was the\r\noyster. He gave a long account of the tragedy of the oyster, a really\r\nimaginative and picturesque account; full of fantastic fishes, and coral\r\ncrags crawling and climbing, and bearded creatures streaking the\r\nseashore and the green darkness in the cellars of the sea.\r\n\r\n“What a horrid irony it is,” he cried, “that this is the only one of the\r\nlower creatures whom we call a Native! We speak of him, and of him alone\r\nas if he were a native of the country. Whereas, indeed, he is an exile\r\nin the universe. What can be conceived more pitiful than the eternal\r\nfrenzy of the impotent amphibian? What is more terrible than the tear of\r\nan oyster? Nature herself has sealed it with the hard seal of eternity.\r\nThe creature man forgets bears against him a testimony that cannot be\r\nforgotten. For the tears of widows and of captives are wiped away at\r\nlast like the tears of children. They vanish like the mists of morning\r\nor the small pools after a flood. But the tear of the oyster is a\r\npearl.”\r\n\r\nThe Poet of the Birds was so excited with his own speech that, after the\r\nmeeting, he walked out with a wild eye to the motor car, which had been\r\nlong awaiting him, the chauffeur giving some faint signs of relief.\r\n\r\n“Toward home, for the present,” said the poet, and stared at the moon\r\nwith an inspired face.\r\n\r\nHe was very fond of motoring, finding it fed him with inspirations; and\r\nhe had been doing it from an early hour that morning, having enjoyed a\r\nslightly lessened sleep. He had scarcely spoken to anybody until he\r\nspoke to the cultured crowd at Ivywood. He did not wish to speak to\r\nanyone for many hours yet. His ideas were racing. He had thrown on a fur\r\ncoat over his velvet jacket, but he let it fly open, having long\r\nforgotten the coldness in the splendour of the moonstruck night. He\r\nrealised only two things: the swiftness of his car and the swiftness of\r\nhis thoughts. He felt, as it were, a fury of omniscience; he seemed\r\nflying with every bird that sped or spun above the woods, with every\r\nsquirrel that had leapt and tumbled within them, with every tree that\r\nhad swung under and sustained the blast.\r\n\r\nYet in a few moments he leaned forward and tapped the glass frontage of\r\nthe car, and the chauffeur suddenly squaring his shoulders, jarringly\r\nstopped the wheels. Dorian Wimpole had just seen something in the clear\r\nmoonlight by the roadside, which appealed both to this and to the other\r\nside of his tradition; something that appealed to Wimpole as well as to\r\nDorian.\r\n\r\nTwo shabby looking men, one in tattered gaiters and the other in what\r\nlooked like the remains of fancy dress with the addition of hair, of so\r\nwild a red that it looked like a wig, were halted under the hedge,\r\napparently loading a donkey cart. At least two rounded, rudely\r\ncylindrical objects, looking more or less like tubs, stood out in the\r\nroad beside the wheels, along with a sort of loose wooden post that lay\r\nalong the road beside them. As a matter of fact, the man in the old\r\ngaiters had just been feeding and watering the donkey, and was now\r\nadjusting its harness more easily. But Dorian Wimpole naturally did not\r\nexpect that sort of thing from that sort of man. There swelled up in him\r\nthe sense that his omnipotence went beyond the poetical; that he was a\r\ngentleman, a magistrate, an M.P. and J.P., and so on. This callousness\r\nor ignorance about animals should not go on while he was a J.P.;\r\nespecially since Ivywood’s last Act. He simply strode across to the\r\nstationary cart and said:\r\n\r\n“You are overloading that animal, and it is forfeited. And you must come\r\nwith me to the police station.”\r\n\r\nHumphrey Pump, who was very considerate to animals, and had always tried\r\nto be considerate to gentlemen, in spite of having put a bullet into one\r\nof their legs, was simply too astounded and distressed to make any\r\nanswer at all. He moved a step or two backward and stared with brown,\r\nblinking eyes at the poet, the donkey, the cask, the cheese, and the\r\nsign-board lying in the road.\r\n\r\nBut Captain Dalroy, with the quicker recovery of his national\r\ntemperament, swept the poet and magistrate a vast fantastic bow and said\r\nwith agreeable impudence, “interested in donkeys, no doubt?”\r\n\r\n“I am interested in all things men forget,” answered the poet, with a\r\nfine touch of pride, “but mostly in those like this, that are most\r\neasily forgotten.”\r\n\r\nSomehow from those two first sentences Pump realised that these two\r\neccentric aristocrats had unconsciously recognised each other. The fact\r\nthat it was unconscious seemed, somehow, to exclude him all the more. He\r\nstirred a little the moonlit dust of the road with his rather\r\ndilapidated boots and eventually strolled across to speak to the\r\nchauffeur.\r\n\r\n“Is the next police station far from here?” he asked.\r\n\r\nThe chauffeur answered with one syllable of which the nearest literal\r\nrendering is “dno.” Other spellings have been attempted, but the\r\nsentiment expressed is that of agnosticism.\r\n\r\nBut something of special brutality of abbreviation made the shrewd, and\r\ntherefore sensitive, Mr. Pump look at the man’s face. And he saw it was\r\nnot only the moonlight that made it white.\r\n\r\nWith that dumb delicacy that was so English in him, Pump looked at the\r\nman again, and saw he was leaning heavily on the car with one arm, and\r\nsaw that the arm was shaking. He understood his countrymen enough to\r\nknow that whatever he said he must say in a careless manner.\r\n\r\n“I hope it’s nearer to your place. You must be a bit done up.”\r\n\r\n“Oh hell!” said the driver and spat on the road.\r\n\r\nPump was sympathetically silent, and Mr. Wimpole’s chauffeur broke out\r\nincoherently, as if in another place.\r\n\r\n“Blarsted beauties o’ dibrike and no breakfast. Blarsted lunch Hivywood\r\nand no lunch. Blarsted black everlastin’ hours artside while ’e ’as ’is\r\ncike an’ champine. And then it’s a dornkey.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean to say,” said Pump in a very serious voice, “that you’ve\r\nhad no food today?”\r\n\r\n“Ow no!” replied the cockney, with the irony of the deathbed. “Ow, of\r\ncourse not.”\r\n\r\nPump strolled back into the road again, picked up the cheese in his left\r\nhand, and landed it on the seat beside the driver. Then his right hand\r\nwent to one of his large loose equivocal pockets, and the blade of a big\r\njack-knife caught and recaught the steady splendours of the moon.\r\n\r\nThe driver stared for several instants at the cheese, with the knife\r\nshaking in his hand. Then he began to hack it, and in that white\r\nwitchlike light the happiness of his face was almost horrible.\r\n\r\nPump was wise in all such things, and knew that just as a little food\r\nwill sometimes prevent sheer intoxication, so a little stimulant will\r\nsometimes prevent sudden and dangerous indigestion. It was practically\r\nimpossible to make the man stop eating cheese. It was far better to give\r\nhim a very little of the rum, especially as it was very good rum, and\r\nbetter than anything he could find in any of the public-houses that were\r\nstill permitted. He walked across the road again and picked up the small\r\ncask, which he put on the other side of the cheese and from which he\r\nfilled, in his own manner, the little cup he carried in his pocket.\r\n\r\nBut at the sight of this the cockney’s eyes lit at once with terror and\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n“But yer cawnt do it,” he whispered hoarsely, “its the pleece. It’s gile\r\nfor that, with no doctor’s letter nor sign-board nor nothink.”\r\n\r\nMr. Humphrey Pump made yet another march back into the road. When he got\r\nthere he hesitated for the first time, but it was quite clear from the\r\nattitude of the two insane aristocrats who were arguing and posturing in\r\nthe road that they would notice nothing except each other. He picked the\r\nloose post off the road and brought it to the car, humorously propping\r\nit erect in the aperture between keg and cheese.\r\n\r\nThe little glass of rum was wavering in the poor chauffeur’s hand\r\nexactly as the big knife had done, but when he looked up and actually\r\nsaw the wooden sign above him, he seemed not so much to pluck up his\r\ncourage, but rather to drag up some forgotten courage from the\r\nfoundations of some unfathomable sea. It was indeed the forgotten\r\ncourage of the people.\r\n\r\nHe looked once at the bleak, black pinewoods around him and took the\r\nmouthful of golden liquid at a gulp, as if it were a fairy potion. He\r\nsat silent; and then, very slowly, a sort of stony glitter began to come\r\ninto his eyes. The brown and vigilant eyes of Humphrey Pump were\r\nstudying him with some anxiety or even fear. He did look rather like a\r\nman enchanted or turned to stone. But he spoke very suddenly.\r\n\r\n“The blighter!” he said. “I’ll give ’im ’ell. I’ll give ’im bleeding\r\n’ell. I’ll give ’im somethink wot ’e don’t expect.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” asked the inn-keeper.\r\n\r\n“Why,” answered the chauffeur, with abrupt composure, “I’ll give ’im a\r\nlittle dornkey.”\r\n\r\nMr. Pump looked troubled. “Do you think,” he observed, affecting to\r\nspeak lightly, “that he’s fit to be trusted even with a little donkey?”\r\n\r\n“Ow, yes,” said the man. “He’s very amiable with donkeys, and donkeys we\r\nis to be amiable with ’im.”\r\n\r\nPump still looked at him doubtfully, appearing or affecting not to\r\nfollow his meaning. Then he looked equally anxiously across at the other\r\ntwo men; but they were still talking. Different as they were in every\r\nother way, they were of the sort who forget everything, class, quarrel,\r\ntime, place and physical facts in front of them, in the lust of lucid\r\nexplanation and equal argument.\r\n\r\nThus, when the Captain began by lightly alluding to the fact that after\r\nall it was his donkey, since he had bought it from a tinker for a just\r\nprice, the police station practically vanished from Wimpole’s mind—and I\r\nfear the donkey-cart also. Nothing remained but the necessity of\r\ndissipating the superstition of personal property.\r\n\r\n“I own nothing,” said the poet, waving his hands outward, “I own nothing\r\nsave in the sense that I own everything. All depends whether wealth or\r\npower be used for or against the higher purposes of the cosmos.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” replied Dalroy, “and how does your motor car serve the higher\r\npurposes of the cosmos?”\r\n\r\n“It helps me,” said Mr. Wimpole, with honourable simplicity, “to produce\r\nmy poems.”\r\n\r\n“And if it could be used for some higher purpose (if such a thing could\r\nbe), if some new purpose had come into the cosmos’s head by accident,”\r\ninquired the other, “I suppose it would cease to be your property.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” replied the dignified Dorian. “I should not complain. Nor\r\nhave you any title to complain when the donkey ceases to be yours when\r\nyou depress it in the cosmic scale.”\r\n\r\n“What makes you think,” asked Dalroy, “that I wanted to depress it?”\r\n\r\n“It is my firm belief,” replied Dorian Wimpole, sternly, “that you\r\nwanted to ride on it” (for indeed the Captain had once repeated his\r\nplayful gesture of putting his large leg across). “Is not that so?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the Captain, innocently, “I never ride on a donkey. I’m\r\nafraid of it.”\r\n\r\n“Afraid of a donkey!” cried Wimpole, incredulously.\r\n\r\n“Afraid of an historical comparison,” said Dalroy.\r\n\r\nThere was a short pause, and Wimpole said coolly enough, “Oh, well,\r\nwe’ve outlived those comparisons.”\r\n\r\n“Easily,” answered the Irish Captain. “It is wonderful how easily one\r\noutlives someone else’s crucifixion.”\r\n\r\n“In this case,” said the other grimly, “I think it is the donkey’s\r\ncrucifixion.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you must have drawn that old Roman caricature of the crucified\r\ndonkey,” said Patrick Dalroy, with an air of some wonder. “How well you\r\nhave worn; why, you look quite young! Well, of course, if this donkey is\r\ncrucified, he must be uncrucified. But are you quite sure,” he added,\r\nvery gravely, “that you know how to uncrucify a donkey? I assure you\r\nit’s one of the rarest of human arts. All a matter of knack. It’s like\r\nthe doctors with the rare diseases, you know; the necessity so seldom\r\narises. Granted that, by the higher purposes of the cosmos, I am unfit\r\nto look after this donkey, I must still feel a faint shiver of\r\nresponsibility in passing him on to you. Will you understand this\r\ndonkey? He is a delicate-minded donkey. He is a complex donkey. How can\r\nI be certain that, on so short an acquaintance, you will understand\r\nevery shade of his little likes and dislikes?”\r\n\r\nThe dog Quoodle, who had been sitting as still as the sphinx under the\r\nshadow of the pine trees, waddled out for an instant into the middle of\r\nthe road and then returned. He ran out when a slight noise as of\r\nrotatory grinding was heard; and ran back when it had ceased. But Dorian\r\nWimpole was much too keen on his philosophical discovery to notice\r\neither dog or wheel.\r\n\r\n“I shall not sit on its back, anyhow,” he said proudly, “but if that\r\nwere all it would be a small matter. It is enough for you that you have\r\nleft it in the hands of the only person who could really understand it;\r\none who searches the skies and seas so as not to neglect the smallest\r\ncreature.”\r\n\r\n“This is a very curious creature,” said the Captain, anxiously, “he has\r\nall sorts of odd antipathies. He can’t stand a motor-car, for instance,\r\nespecially one that throbs like that while it’s standing still. He\r\ndoesn’t mind a fur coat so much, but if you wear a brown velvet jacket\r\nunder it, he bites you. And you must keep him out of the way of a\r\ncertain kind of people. I don’t suppose you’ve met them; but they always\r\nthink that anybody with less than two hundred a year is drunk and very\r\ncruel, and that anybody with more than two thousand a year is conducting\r\nthe Day of Judgment. If you will keep our dear donkey from the society\r\nof such persons—Hullo! Hullo! Hullo!”\r\n\r\nHe turned in genuine disturbance, and dashed after the dog, who had\r\ndashed after the motor-car and jumped inside. The Captain jumped in\r\nafter the dog, to pull him out again. But before he could do so, he\r\nfound the car was flying along too fast for any such leap. He looked up\r\nand saw the sign of “The Old Ship” erect in the front like a rigid\r\nbanner; and Pump, with his cask and cheese, sitting solidly beside the\r\ndriver.\r\n\r\nThe thing was more of an earthquake and transformation to him even than\r\nto any of the others; but he rose waveringly to his feet and shouted out\r\nto Wimpole.\r\n\r\n“You’ve left it in the right hands. I’ve never been cruel to a motor.”\r\n\r\nIn the moonlight of the magic pine-wood far behind, Dorian and the\r\ndonkey were left looking at each other.\r\n\r\nTo the mystical mind, when it is a mind at all (which is by no means\r\nalways the case), there are no two things more impressive and symbolical\r\nthan a poet and a donkey. And the donkey was a very genuine donkey, and\r\nthe poet was a very genuine poet; however lawfully he might be mistaken\r\nfor the other animal at times. The interest of the donkey in the poet\r\nwill never be known. The interest of the poet in the donkey was\r\nperfectly genuine; and survived even that appalling private interview in\r\nthe owlish secrecy of the woods.\r\n\r\nBut I think even the poet would have been enlightened if he had seen the\r\nwhite, set, frantic face of the man on the driver’s seat of his\r\nvanishing motor. If he had seen it he might have remembered the name,\r\nor, perhaps, even begun to understand the nature of a certain animal\r\nwhich is neither the donkey nor the oyster; but the creature whom man\r\nhas always found it easiest to forget, since the hour he forgot God in a\r\nGarden.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                       THE SONGS OF THE CAR CLUB\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE than once as the car flew through black and silver fairylands of\r\nfir wood and pine wood, Dalroy put his head out of the side window and\r\nremonstrated with the chauffeur without effect. He was reduced at last\r\nto asking him where he was going.\r\n\r\n“I’m goin’ ’ome,” said the driver in an undecipherable voice. “I’m a\r\ngoin’ ’ome to my mar.”\r\n\r\n“And where does she live?” asked Dalroy, with something more like\r\ndiffidence than he had ever shown before in his life.\r\n\r\n“Wiles,” said the man, “but I ain’t seen ’er since I was born. But\r\nshe’ll do.”\r\n\r\n“You must realise,” said Dalroy, with difficulty, “that you may be\r\narrested—it’s the man’s own car; and he’s left behind with nothing to\r\neat, so to speak.”\r\n\r\n“’E’s got ’is dornkey,” grunted the man. “Let the stinker eat ’is\r\ndornkey, with thistle sauce. ’E would if ’e was as ’ollow as I was.”\r\n\r\nHumphrey Pump opened the glass window that separated him from the rear\r\npart of the car, and turned to speak to his friend over his square elbow\r\nand shoulder.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid,” he said, “he won’t stop for anything just yet. He’s as mad\r\nas Moody’s aunt, as they say.”\r\n\r\n“Do they say it?” asked the Captain, with a sort of anxiety. “They never\r\nsaid it in Ithaca.”\r\n\r\n“Honestly, I think you’d better leave him alone,” answered Pump, with\r\nhis sagacious face. “He’d just run us into a Scotch Express like Dandy\r\nMutton did, when they said he was driving carelessly. We can send the\r\ncar back to Ivywood somehow later on, and really, I don’t think it’ll do\r\nthe gentleman any harm to spend a night with a donkey. The donkey might\r\nteach him something, I tell you.”\r\n\r\n“It’s true he denied the Principle of Private Property,” said Dalroy,\r\nreflectively, “but I fancy he was thinking of a plain house fixed on the\r\nground. A house on wheels, such as this, he might perhaps think a more\r\npermanent possession. But I never understand it;” and again he passed a\r\nweary palm across his open forehead. “Have you ever noticed, Hump, what\r\nis really odd about those people?”\r\n\r\nThe car shot on amid the comfortable silence of Pump, and then the\r\nIrishman said again:\r\n\r\n“That poet in the pussy-cat clothes wasn’t half bad. Lord Ivywood isn’t\r\ncruel; but he’s inhuman. But that man wasn’t inhuman. He was ignorant,\r\nlike most cultured fellows. But what’s odd about them is that they try\r\nto be simple and never clear away a single thing that’s complicated. If\r\nthey have to choose between beef and pickles, they always abolish the\r\nbeef. If they have to choose between a meadow and a motor, they forbid\r\nthe meadow. Shall I tell you the secret? These men only surrender the\r\nthings that bind them to other men. Go and dine with a temperance\r\nmillionaire and you won’t find he’s abolished the _hors d’œuvres_ or the\r\nfive courses or even the coffee. What he’s abolished is the port and\r\nsherry, because poor men like that as well as rich. Go a step farther,\r\nand you won’t find he’s abolished the fine silver forks and spoons, but\r\nhe’s abolished the meat, because poor men like meat—when they can get\r\nit. Go a step farther, and you won’t find he goes without gardens or\r\ngorgeous rooms, which poor men can’t enjoy at all. But you will find he\r\nboasts of early rising, because sleep is a thing poor men can still\r\nenjoy. About the only thing they can still enjoy. Nobody ever heard of a\r\nmodern philanthropist giving up petrol or typewriting or troops of\r\nservants. No, no! What he gives up must be some simple and universal\r\nthing. He will give up beef or beer or sleep—because these pleasures\r\nremind him that he is only a man.”\r\n\r\nHumphrey Pump nodded, but still answered nothing; and the voice of the\r\nsprawling Dalroy took one of its upward turns of a sort of soaring\r\nflippancy; which commonly embodied itself in remembering some song he\r\nhad composed.\r\n\r\n“Such,” he said, “was the case of the late Mr. Mandragon, so long\r\npopular in English aristocratic society as a bluff and simple democrat\r\nfrom the West, until he was unfortunately sand-bagged by six men whose\r\nwives he had had shot by private detectives, on his incautiously landing\r\non American soil.\r\n\r\n “Mr. Mandragon the Millionaire, he wouldn’t have wine or wife,\r\n  He couldn’t endure complexity; he lived the simple life;\r\n  He ordered his lunch by megaphone in manly, simple tones,\r\n  And used all his motors for canvassing voters, and twenty telephones;\r\n      Besides a dandy little machine,\r\n      Cunning and neat as ever was seen,\r\n      With a hundred pulleys and cranks between,\r\n      Made of iron and kept quite clean,\r\n  To hoist him out of his healthful bed on every day of his life,\r\n  And wash him and brush him and shave him and dress him to live the\r\n     Simple Life.\r\n\r\n “Mr. Mandragon was most refined and quietly, neatly dressed,\r\n  Say all the American newspapers that know refinement best;\r\n  Quiet and neat the hair and hat, and the coat quiet and neat,\r\n  A trouser worn upon either leg, while boots adorned the feet;\r\n       And not, as anyone might expect,\r\n       A Tiger Skin, all striped and specked,\r\n       And a Peacock Hat with the tail erect,\r\n       A scarlet tunic with sunflowers decked—\r\n  That might have had a more marked effect,\r\n  And pleased the pride of a weaker man that yearned for wine or wife;\r\n  But fame and the flagon for Mr. Mandragon obscured the Simple Life.\r\n\r\n “Mr. Mandragon the Millionaire, I am happy to say, is dead.\r\n  He enjoyed a quiet funeral in a crematorium shed,\r\n  And he lies there fluffy and soft and grey and certainly quite refined,\r\n  When he might have rotted to flowers and fruit with Adam and all\r\n     mankind.\r\n      Or been eaten by bears that fancy blood,\r\n      Or burnt on a big tall tower of wood,\r\n      In a towering flame as a heathen should,\r\n      Or even sat with us here at food,\r\n  Merrily taking twopenny rum and cheese with a pocket knife,\r\n  But these were luxuries lost for him that lived for the Simple Life.”\r\n\r\nMr. Pump had made many attempts to arrest this song, but they were as\r\nvain as all attempts to arrest the car. The angry chauffeur seemed,\r\nindeed, rather inspired to further energy by the violent vocal noises\r\nbehind; and Pump again found it best to fall back on conversation.\r\n\r\n“Well, Captain,” he said, amicably. “I can’t quite agree with you about\r\nthose things. Of course, you can trust foreigners too much as poor\r\nThompson did; but then you can go too far the other way. Aunt Sarah lost\r\na thousand pounds that way. I told her again and again he wasn’t a\r\nnigger, but she wouldn’t believe me. And, of course, that was just the\r\nkind of thing to offend an ambassador if he was an Austrian. It seems to\r\nme, Captain, you aren’t quite fair to these foreign chaps. Take these\r\nAmericans, now! There were many Americans went by Pebblewick, you may\r\nsuppose. But in all the lot there was never a bad lot; never a nasty\r\nAmerican, nor a stupid American—nor, well, never an American that I\r\ndidn’t rather like.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” said Dalroy, “you mean there was never an American who did not\r\nappreciate ‘The Old Ship.’”\r\n\r\n“I suppose I do mean that,” answered the inn-keeper, “and somehow, I\r\nfeel ‘The Old Ship’ might appreciate the American too.”\r\n\r\n“You English are an extraordinary lot,” said the Irishman, with a sudden\r\nand sombre quietude. “I sometimes feel you may pull through after all.”\r\n\r\nAfter another silence he said, “You’re always right, Hump, and one\r\noughtn’t to think of Yankees like that. The rich are the scum of the\r\nearth in every country. And a vast proportion of the real Americans are\r\namong the most courteous, intelligent, self-respecting people in the\r\nworld. Some attribute this to the fact that a vast proportion of the\r\nreal Americans are Irishmen.”\r\n\r\nPump was still silent, and the Captain resumed in a moment.\r\n\r\n“All the same,” he said, “it’s very hard for a man, especially a man of\r\na small country like me, to understand how it must feel to be an\r\nAmerican; especially in the matter of nationality. I shouldn’t like to\r\nhave to write the American National Anthem, but fortunately there is no\r\ngreat probability of the commission being given. The shameful secret of\r\nmy inability to write an American patriotic song is one that will die\r\nwith me.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what about an English one,” said Pump, sturdily. “You might do\r\nworse, Captain.”\r\n\r\n“English, you bloody tyrant,” said Patrick, indignantly. “I could no\r\nmore fancy a song by an Englishman than you could one by that dog.”\r\n\r\nMr. Humphrey Pump gravely took the paper from his pocket, on which he\r\nhad previously inscribed the sin and desolation of grocers, and felt in\r\nanother of his innumerable pockets for a pencil.\r\n\r\n“Hullo,” cried Dalroy. “Are you going to have a shy at the Ballad of\r\nQuoodle?”\r\n\r\nQuoodle lifted his ears at his name. Mr. Pump smiled a slight and\r\nembarrassed smile. He was secretly proud of Dalroy’s admiration for his\r\nprevious literary attempts and he had some natural knack for verse as a\r\ngame, as he had for all games; and his reading, though desultory, had\r\nnot been merely rustic or low.\r\n\r\n“On condition,” he said, deprecatingly, “that you write a song for the\r\nEnglish.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, very well,” said Patrick, with a huge sigh that really indicated\r\nthe very opposite of reluctance. “We must do something till the thing\r\nstops, I suppose, and this seems a blameless parlour game. ‘Songs of the\r\nCar Club.’ Sounds quite aristocratic.”\r\n\r\nAnd he began to make marks with a pencil on the fly-leaf of a little\r\nbook he had in his pocket—Wilson’s _Noctes Ambrosianæ_. Every now and\r\nthen, however, he looked up and delayed his own composition by watching\r\nPump and the dog, whose proceedings amused him very much. For the owner\r\nof “The Old Ship” sat sucking his pencil and looking at Mr. Quoodle with\r\neyes of fathomless attention. Every now and then he slightly scratched\r\nhis brown hair with the pencil, and wrote down a word. And the dog\r\nQuoodle, with that curious canine power of either understanding or most\r\nbrazenly pretending to understand what is going on, sat erect with his\r\nhead at an angle, as if he were sitting for his portrait.\r\n\r\nHence it happened that though Pump’s poem was a little long, as are\r\noften the poems of inexperienced poets, and though Dalroy’s poem was\r\nvery short (being much hurried toward the end) the long poem was\r\nfinished some time before the short one.\r\n\r\nTherefore it was that there was first produced for the world the song\r\nmore familiarly known as “No Noses,” or more correctly called “The Song\r\nof Quoodle.” Part of it ran eventually thus:—\r\n\r\n                   “They haven’t got no noses\r\n                      The fallen sons of Eve,\r\n                    Even the smell of roses\r\n                    Is not what they supposes,\r\n                    But more than mind discloses,\r\n                      And more than men believe.\r\n\r\n                   “They haven’t got no noses,\r\n                      They cannot even tell\r\n                    When door and darkness closes\r\n                    The park a Jew encloses,\r\n                    Where even the Law of Moses\r\n                      Will let you steal a smell;\r\n\r\n                   “The brilliant smell of water,\r\n                      The brave smell of a stone,\r\n                    The smell of dew and thunder\r\n                    And old bones buried under,\r\n                    Are things in which they blunder\r\n                      And err, if left alone.\r\n\r\n                   “The wind from winter forests,\r\n                      The scent of scentless flowers,\r\n                     The breath of bride’s adorning,\r\n                    The smell of snare and warning,\r\n                    The smell of Sunday morning,\r\n                      God gave to us for ours.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                    “And Quoodle here discloses\r\n                       All things that Quoodle can;\r\n                     They haven’t got no noses,\r\n                     They haven’t got no noses,\r\n                     And goodness only knowses\r\n                       The Noselessness of Man.”\r\n\r\nThis poem also shows traces of haste in its termination, and the present\r\neditor (who has no aim save truth) is bound to confess that parts of it\r\nwere supplied in the criticisms of the Captain, and even enriched (in\r\nlater and livelier circumstances) by the Poet of the Birds himself. At\r\nthe actual moment the chief features of this realistic song about dogs\r\nwas a crashing chorus of “Bow-wow, wow,” begun by Mr. Patrick Dalroy;\r\nbut immediately imitated (much more successfully) by Mr. Quoodle. In the\r\nface of all this Dalroy suffered some real difficulty in fulfilling the\r\nbargain by reading out his much shorter poem about what he imagined an\r\nEnglishman might feel. Indeed there was something very rough and vague\r\nin his very voice as he read it out; as of one who had not found the key\r\nto his problem. The present compiler (who has no aim save truth) must\r\nconfess that the verses ran as follows:—\r\n\r\n                 “St. George he was for England,\r\n                    And before he killed the dragon\r\n                  He drank a pint of English ale\r\n                    Out of an English flagon.\r\n                  For though he fast right readily\r\n                    In hair-shirt or in mail,\r\n                  It isn’t safe to give him cakes\r\n                    Unless you give him ale.\r\n\r\n                  St. George he was for England,\r\n                    And right gallantly set free\r\n                  The lady left for dragon’s meat\r\n                    And tied up to a tree;\r\n                  But since he stood for England\r\n                    And knew what England means,\r\n                  Unless you give him bacon,\r\n                    You mustn’t give him beans.\r\n\r\n                 “St. George he was for England,\r\n                     And shall wear the shield he wore\r\n                  When we go out in armour,\r\n                    With the battle-cross before;\r\n                  But though he is jolly company\r\n                    And very pleased to dine,\r\n                  It isn’t safe to give him nuts\r\n                    Unless you give him wine.”\r\n\r\n“Very philosophical song that,” said Dalroy, shaking his head solemnly,\r\n“full of deep thought. I really think that is about the truth of the\r\nmatter, in the case of the Englishman. Your enemies say you’re stupid,\r\nand you boast of being illogical—which is about the only thing you do\r\nthat really _is_ stupid. As if anybody ever made an Empire or anything\r\nelse by saying that two and two make five. Or as if anyone was ever the\r\nstronger for _not_ understanding anything—if it were only tip-cat or\r\nchemistry. But this _is_ true about you Hump. You English are supremely\r\nan artistic people, and therefore you go by associations, as I said in\r\nmy song. You won’t have one thing without the other thing that goes with\r\nit. And as you can’t imagine a village without a squire and parson, or a\r\ncollege without port and old oak, you get the reputation of a\r\nConservative people. But it’s because you’re sensitive, Hump, not\r\nbecause you’re stupid, that you won’t part with things. It’s lies, lies\r\nand flattery they tell you, Hump, when they tell you you’re fond of\r\ncompromise. I tell ye, Hump, every real revolution is a compromise. D’ye\r\nthink Wolfe Tone or Charles Stuart Parnell never compromised? But it’s\r\njust because you’re afraid of a compromise that you won’t have a\r\nrevolution. If you really overhauled ‘The Old Ship’—or Oxford—you’d have\r\nto make up your mind what to take and what to leave, and it would break\r\nyour heart, Humphrey Pump.”\r\n\r\nHe stared in front of him with a red and ruminant face, and at length\r\nadded, somewhat more gloomily.\r\n\r\n“This æsthetic way we have, Hump, has only two little disadvantages\r\nwhich I will now explain to you. The first is exactly what has sent us\r\nflying in this contraption. When the beautiful, smooth, harmonious thing\r\nyou’ve made is worked by a new type, in a new spirit, then I tell you it\r\nwould be better for you a thousand times to be living under the thousand\r\npaper constitutions of Condorcet and Sieyès. When the English oligarchy\r\nis run by an Englishman who hasn’t got an English mind—then you have\r\nLord Ivywood and all this nightmare, of which God could only guess the\r\nend.”\r\n\r\nThe car had beaten some roods of dust behind it, and he ended still more\r\ndarkly:\r\n\r\n“And the other disadvantage, my amiable æsthete, is this. If ever, in\r\nblundering about the planet, you come on an island in the\r\nAtlantic—Atlantis, let us say—which won’t accept _all_ your pretty\r\npicture—to which you can’t give everything—_why_ you will probably\r\ndecide to give nothing. You will say in your hearts: ‘Perhaps they will\r\nstarve soon’; and you will become, for that island, the deafest and the\r\nmost evil of all the princes of the earth.”\r\n\r\nIt was already daybreak, and Pump, who knew the English boundaries\r\nalmost by intuition, could tell even through the twilight that the tail\r\nof the little town they were leaving behind was of a new sort, the sort\r\nto be seen in the western border. The chauffeur’s phrase about his\r\nmother might merely have been a music-hall joke; but certainly he had\r\ndriven darkly in that direction.\r\n\r\nWhite morning lay about the grey stoney streets like spilt milk. A few\r\nproletarian early risers, wearier at morning than most men at night,\r\nseemed merely of opinion that it was no use crying over it. The two or\r\nthree last houses, which looked almost too tired to stand upright,\r\nseemed to have moved the Captain into another sleepy explosion.\r\n\r\n“There are two kinds of idealists, as everybody knows—or must have\r\nthought of. There are those who idealize the real and those who\r\n(precious seldom) realize the ideal. Artistic and poetical people like\r\nthe English generally idealize the real. This I have expressed in a\r\nsong, which—”\r\n\r\n“No, really,” protested the innkeeper, “really now, Captain—”\r\n\r\n“This I have expressed in a song,” repeated Dalroy, in an adamantine\r\nmanner, “which I will now sing with every circumstance of leisure,\r\nloudness, or any other—”\r\n\r\nHe stopped because the flying universe seemed to stop. Charging\r\nhedgerows came to a halt, as if challenged by the bugle. The racing\r\nforests stood rigid. The last few tottering houses stood suddenly at\r\nattention. For a noise like a pistol-shot from the car itself had\r\nstopped all that race, as a pistol-shot might start any other.\r\n\r\nThe driver clambered out very slowly, and stood about in various tragic\r\nattitudes round the car. He opened an unsuspected number of doors and\r\nwindows in the car, and touched things and twisted things and felt\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n“I must back as best I can to that there garrige, sir,” he said, in a\r\nheavy and husky tone they had not heard from him before.\r\n\r\nThen he looked round on the long woods and the last houses, and seemed\r\nto gnaw his lip, like a great general who has made a great mistake. His\r\nbrow seemed as black as ever, yet his voice, when he spoke again, had\r\nfallen many further degrees toward its dull and daily tone.\r\n\r\n“Yer see, this is a bit bad,” he said. “It’ll be a beastly job even at\r\nthe best plices, if I’m gettin’ back at all.”\r\n\r\n“Getting back,” repeated Dalroy, opening the blue eyes of a bull. “Back\r\nwhere?”\r\n\r\n“Well, yer see,” said the chauffeur, reasonably, “I was bloody keen to\r\nshow ’im it was me drove the car and not ’im. By a bit o’ bad luck, I\r\ndone damage to ’is car. Well—if _you_ can stick in ’is car—”\r\n\r\nCaptain Patrick Dalroy sprang out of the car so rapidly that he almost\r\nreeled and slipped upon the road. The dog sprang after him, barking\r\nfuriously.\r\n\r\n“Hump,” said Patrick, quietly. “I’ve found out everything about you. I\r\nknow what always bothered me about the Englishman.”\r\n\r\nThen, after an instant’s silence, he said, “That Frenchman was right who\r\nsaid (I forget how he put it) that you march to Trafalgar Square to rid\r\nyourself of your temper; not to rid yourself of your tyrant. Our friend\r\nwas quite ready to rebel, rushing away. To rebel sitting still was too\r\nmuch for him. Do you read _Punch_? I am sure you do. Pump and _Punch_\r\nmust be almost the only survivors of the Victorian Age. Do you remember\r\nan old joke in an excellent picture, representing two ragged Irishmen\r\nwith guns, waiting behind a stone wall to shoot a landlord? One of the\r\nIrishmen says the landlord is late, and adds, ‘I hope no accident’s\r\nhappened to the poor gintleman.’ Well, it’s all perfectly true; I knew\r\nthat Irishman intimately, but I want to tell you a secret about him. He\r\nwas an Englishman.”\r\n\r\nThe chauffeur had backed with breathless care to the entrance of the\r\ngarage, which was next door to a milkman’s or merely separated from it\r\nby a black and lean lane, looking no larger than the crack of a door. It\r\nmust, however, have been larger than it looked, because Captain Dalroy\r\ndisappeared down it.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to have beckoned the driver after him; at any rate that\r\nfunctionary instantly followed. The functionary came out again in an\r\nalmost guilty haste, touching his cap and stuffing loose papers into his\r\npocket. Then the functionary returned yet again from what he called the\r\n“garrige,” carrying larger and looser things over his arm.\r\n\r\nAll this did Mr. Humphrey Pump observe, not without interest. The place,\r\nremote as it was, was evidently a _rendez-vous_ for motorists. Otherwise\r\na very tall motorist, throttled and masked in the most impenetrable\r\ndegree, would hardly have strolled up to speak to him. Still less would\r\nthe tall motorist have handed him a similar horrid disguise of wraps and\r\ngoggles, in a bundle over his arm. Least of all would any motorist,\r\nhowever tall, have said to him from behind the cap and goggles, “Put on\r\nthese things, Hump, and then we’ll go into the milk shop. I’m waiting\r\nfor the car. Which car, my seeker after truth? Why the car I’m going to\r\nbuy for you to drive.”\r\n\r\nThe remorseful chauffeur, after many adventures, did actually find his\r\nway back to the little moonlit wood where he had left his master and the\r\ndonkey. But his master and the donkey had vanished.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                       THE SEVEN MOODS OF DORIAN\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT timeless clock of all lunatics, which was so bright in the sky that\r\nnight, may really have had some elfin luck about it, like a silver\r\npenny. Not only had it initiated Mr. Hibbs into the mysteries of\r\nDionysius, and Mr. Bullrose into the arboreal habits of his ancestors,\r\nbut one night of it made a very considerable and rather valuable change\r\nin Mr. Dorian Wimpole, the Poet of the Birds. He was a man neither\r\nfoolish nor evil, any more than Shelley; only a man made sterile by\r\nliving in a world of indirectness and insincerity, with words rather\r\nthan with things. He had not had the smallest intention of starving his\r\nchauffeur; he did not realize that there was worse spiritual murder in\r\nmerely forgetting him. But as hour after hour passed over him, alone\r\nwith the donkey and the moon, he went through a raging and shifting\r\nseries of frames of mind, such as his cultured friends would have\r\ndescribed as moods.\r\n\r\nThe First Mood, I regret to say, was one of black and grinding hatred.\r\nHe had no notion of the chauffeur’s grievance, and could only suppose he\r\nhad been bribed or intimidated by the demonic donkey-torturers. But Mr.\r\nWimpole was much more capable at that moment of torturing a chauffeur\r\nthan Mr. Pump had ever been of torturing a donkey; for no sane man can\r\nhate an animal. He kicked the stones in the road, sending them flying\r\ninto the forest, and wished that each one of them was a chauffeur. The\r\nbracken by the roadside he tore up by the roots, as representing the\r\nhair of the chauffeur, to which it bore no resemblance. He hit with his\r\nfist such trees, as, I suppose, seemed in form and expression most\r\nreminiscent of the chauffeur; but desisted from this, finding that in\r\nthis apparently one-sided contest the tree had rather the best of it.\r\nBut the whole wood and the whole world had become a kind of omnipresent\r\nand pantheistic chauffeur, and he hit at him everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe thoughtful reader will realise that Mr. Wimpole had already taken a\r\nconsiderable upward stride in what he would have called the cosmic\r\nscale. The next best thing to really loving a fellow creature is really\r\nhating him: especially when he is a poorer man separated from you\r\notherwise by mere social stiffness. The desire to murder him is at least\r\nan acknowledgment that he is alive. Many a man has owed the first white\r\ngleams of the dawn of Democracy in his soul to a desire to find a stick\r\nand beat the butler. And we have it on the unimpeachable local authority\r\nof Mr. Humphrey Pump that Squire Merriman chased his librarian through\r\nthree villages with a horse-pistol; and was a Radical ever after.\r\n\r\nHis rage also did him good merely as a relief, and he soon passed into a\r\nsecond and more positive mood of meditation.\r\n\r\n“The damnable monkeys go on like this,” he muttered, “and then they call\r\na donkey one of the Lower Animals. Ride on a donkey would he? I’d like\r\nto see the donkey riding on him for a bit. Good old man.”\r\n\r\nThe patient ass turned mild eyes on him when he patted it, and Dorian\r\nWimpole discovered, with a sort of subconscious surprise, that he really\r\nwas fond of the donkey. Deeper still in his subliminal self he knew that\r\nhe had never been fond of an animal before. His poems about fantastic\r\ncreatures had been quite sincere, and quite cold. When he said he loved\r\na shark, he meant he saw no reason for hating a shark, which was right\r\nenough. There is no reason for hating a shark, however much reason there\r\nmay be for avoiding one. There is no harm in a craken if you keep it in\r\na tank—or in a sonnet.\r\n\r\nBut he also realised that his love of creatures had been turned round\r\nand was working from the other end. The donkey was a companion, and not\r\na monstrosity. It was dear because it was near, not because it was\r\ndistant. The oyster had attracted him because it was utterly unlike a\r\nman; unless it be counted a touch of masculine vanity to grow a beard.\r\nThe fancy is no idler than that he had himself used, in suggesting a\r\nsort of feminine vanity in the permanence of a pearl. But in that\r\nmaddening vigil among the mystic pines, he found himself more and more\r\ndrawn toward the donkey, because it was more like a man than anything\r\nelse around him; because it had eyes to see, and ears to hear—and the\r\nlatter even unduly developed.\r\n\r\n“He that hath ears to hear, let him hear,” he said, scratching those\r\ngrey hairy flappers with affection. “Haven’t you lifted your ears toward\r\nHeaven? And will you be the first to hear the Last Trumpet?”\r\n\r\nThe ass rubbed his nose against him with what seemed almost like a human\r\ncaress. And Dorian caught himself wondering how a caress from an oyster\r\ncould be managed. Everything else around him was beautiful, but inhuman.\r\nOnly in the first glory of anger could he really trace in a tall\r\npine-tree the features of an ex-taxi-cabman from Kennington. Trees and\r\nferns had no living ears that they could wag nor mild eyes that they\r\ncould move. He patted the donkey again.\r\n\r\nBut the donkey had reconciled him to the landscape, and in his third\r\nmood he began to realize how beautiful it was. On a second study, he was\r\nnot sure it was so inhuman. Rather he felt that its beauty at least was\r\nhalf human; that the aureole of the sinking moon behind the woods was\r\nchiefly lovely because it was like the tender-coloured aureole of an\r\nearly saint; and that the young trees were, after all, noble because\r\nthey held up their heads like virgins. Cloudily there crowded into his\r\nmind ideas with which it was imperfectly familiar, especially an idea\r\nwhich he had heard called “The Image of God.” It seemed to him more and\r\nmore that all these things, from the donkey to the very docks and ferns\r\nby the roadside, were dignified and sanctified by their partial\r\nresemblance to something else. It was as if they were baby drawings: the\r\nwild, crude sketches of Nature in her first sketch-books of stone.\r\n\r\nHe had flung himself on a pile of pine-needles to enjoy the gathering\r\ndarkness of the pinewoods as the moon sank behind them. There is nothing\r\nmore deep and wonderful than really impenetrable pinewoods where the\r\nnearer trees show against the more shadowy; a tracery of silver upon\r\ngrey and of grey upon black.\r\n\r\nIt was, by this time, in pure pleasure and idleness that he picked up a\r\npine-needle to philosophise about it.\r\n\r\n“Think of sitting on needles!” he said. “Yet, I suppose this is the sort\r\nof needle that Eve, in the old legend, used in Eden. Aye, and the old\r\nlegend was right, too! Think of sitting on all the needles in London!\r\nThink of sitting on all the needles in Sheffield! Think of sitting on\r\nany needles, except on all the needles of Paradise! Oh, yes, the old\r\nlegend was right enough. The very needles of God are softer than the\r\ncarpets of men.”\r\n\r\nHe took a pleasure in watching the weird little forest animals creeping\r\nout from under the green curtains of the wood. He reminded himself that\r\nin the old legend they had been as tame as the ass, as well as being as\r\ncomic. He thought of Adam naming the animals, and said to a beetle, “I\r\nshould call _you_ Budger.”\r\n\r\nThe slugs gave him great entertainment, and so did the worms. He felt a\r\nnew and realistic interest in them which he had not known before; it\r\nwas, indeed, the interest that a man feels in a mouse in a dungeon; the\r\ninterest of any man tied by the leg and forced to see the fascination of\r\nsmall things. Creatures of the wormy kind, especially, crept out at very\r\nlong intervals; yet he found himself waiting patiently for hours for the\r\npleasure of their acquaintance. One of them rather specially arrested\r\nhis eye, because it was a little longer than most worms and seemed to be\r\nturning its head in the direction of the donkey’s left foreleg. Also, it\r\nhad a head to turn, which most worms have not.\r\n\r\nDorian Wimpole did not know much about exact Natural History, except\r\nwhat he had once got up very thoroughly from an encyclopedia for the\r\npurposes of a sympathetic _vilanelle_. But as this information was\r\nentirely concerned with the conjectural causes of laughter in the Hyena,\r\nit was not directly helpful in this case. But though he did not know\r\nmuch Natural History, he knew some. He knew enough to know that a worm\r\nought not to have a head, and especially not a squared and flattened\r\nhead, shaped like a spade or a chisel. He knew enough to know that a\r\ncreeping thing with a head of that pattern survives in the English\r\ncountry sides, though it is not common. In short, he knew enough to step\r\nacross the road and set a sharp and savage boot-heel on the neck and\r\nspine of the creature, breaking it into three black bits that writhed\r\nonce more before they stiffened.\r\n\r\nThen he gave out a great explosive sigh. The donkey, whose leg had been\r\nin such danger, looked at the dead adder with eyes that had never lost\r\ntheir moony mildness. Even Dorian, himself, looked at it for a long\r\ntime, and with feelings he could neither arrest nor understand, before\r\nhe remembered that he had been comparing the little wood to Eden.\r\n\r\n“And even in Eden,” he said at last; and then the words of Fitzgerald\r\nfailed upon his lips.\r\n\r\nAnd while he was warring with such words and thoughts, something\r\nhappened about him and behind him; something he had written about a\r\nhundred times and read about a thousand; something he had never seen in\r\nhis life. It flung faintly across the broad foliage a wan and pearly\r\nlight far more mysterious than the lost moonshine. It seemed to enter\r\nthrough all the doors and windows of the woodland, pale and silent but\r\nconfident, like men that keep a tryst; soon its white robes had threads\r\nof gold and scarlet: and the name of it was morning.\r\n\r\nFor some time past, loud and in vain, all the birds had been singing to\r\nthe Poet of the Birds. But when that minstrel actually saw broad\r\ndaylight breaking over wood and road, the effect on him was somewhat\r\ncurious. He stood staring at it in gaping astonishment, until it had\r\nfulfilled the fulness of its shining fate; and the pine-cones and the\r\ncurling ferns and the live donkey and the dead viper were almost as\r\ndistinct as they could be at noon, or in a Preraphaelite picture. And\r\nthen the Fourth Mood fell upon him like a bolt from the blue, and he\r\nstrode across and took the donkey’s bridle, as if to lead it along.\r\n\r\n“Damn it all,” he cried, in a voice as cheerful as the cockcrow that\r\nrang recently from the remote village, “it’s not everybody who’s killed\r\na snake.” Then he added, reflectively, “I bet Dr. Gluck never did. Come\r\nalong, donkey, let’s have some adventures.”\r\n\r\nThe finding and fighting of positive evil is the beginning of all\r\nfun—and even of all farce. All the wild woodland looked jolly now the\r\nsnake was killed. It was one of the fallacies of his literary clique to\r\nrefer all natural emotions to literary names, but it might not untruly\r\nbe said that he had passed out of the mood of Maeterlinck into the mood\r\nof Whitman, and out of the mood of Whitman into the mood of Stevenson.\r\nHe had not been a hypocrite when he asked for gilded birds of Asia or\r\npurple polypi out of the Southern Seas; he was not a hypocrite now, when\r\nhe asked for mere comic adventures along a common English road. It was\r\nhis misfortune and not his fault if his first adventure was his last;\r\nand was much too comic to laugh at.\r\n\r\nAlready the wan morning had warmed into a pale blue and was spotted with\r\nthose little plump pink clouds which must surely have been the origin of\r\nthe story that pigs might fly. The insects of the grass chattered so\r\ncheerfully that every green tongue seemed to be talking. The skyline on\r\nevery side was broken only by objects that encouraged such\r\nswashbucklering comedy. There was a windmill that Chaucer’s Miller might\r\nhave inhabited or Cervantes’ champion charged. There was an old leaden\r\nchurch spire that might have been climbed by Robert Clive. Away toward\r\nPebblewick and the sea, there were the two broken stumps of wood which\r\nHumphrey Pump declares to this day to have been the stands for an\r\nunsuccessful children’s swing; but which tourists always accept as the\r\nremains of the antique gallows. In the gaiety of such surroundings, it\r\nis small wonder if Dorian and the donkey stepped briskly along the road.\r\nThe very donkey reminded him of Sancho Panza.\r\n\r\nHe did not wake out of this boisterous reverie of the white road and the\r\nwind till a motor horn had first hooted and then howled, till the ground\r\nhad shaken with the shock of a stoppage, and till a human hand fell\r\nheavily and tightly on his shoulder. He looked up and saw the complete\r\ncostume of a Police Inspector. He did not worry about the face. And\r\nthere fell on him the Fifth, or Unexpected Mood, which is called by the\r\nvulgar Astonishment.\r\n\r\nIn despair he looked at the motor car itself that had anchored so\r\nabruptly under the opposite hedge. The man at the steering wheel was so\r\nerect and unresponsive that Dorian felt sure he was feasting his eyes on\r\nyet another policeman. But on the seat behind was a very different\r\nfigure, a figure that baffled him all the more because he felt certain\r\nhe had seen it somewhere. The figure was long and slim, with sloping\r\nshoulders, and the costume, which was untidy, yet contrived to give the\r\nimpression that it was tidy on other occasions. The individual had\r\nbright yellow hair, one lock of which stuck straight up and was exalted,\r\nlike the little horn in his favorite scriptures. Another tuft of it, in\r\na bright but blinding manner, fell across and obscured the left optic,\r\nas in literal fulfilment of the parable of a beam in the eye. The eyes,\r\nwith or without beams in them, looked a little bewildered, and the\r\nindividual was always nervously resettling his necktie. For the\r\nindividual went by the name of Hibbs, and had only recently recovered\r\nfrom experiences wholly new to him.\r\n\r\n“What on earth do you want?” asked Wimpole of the policeman.\r\n\r\nHis innocent and startled face, and perhaps other things about his\r\nappearance, evidently caused the Inspector to waver.\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s about this ’ere donkey, sir,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Do you think I stole it?” cried the indignant aristocrat. “Well, of all\r\nthe mad worlds! A pack of thieves steal my Limousine, I save their\r\ndamned donkey’s life at the risk of my own—and _I’m_ run in for\r\nstealing.”\r\n\r\nThe clothes of the indignant aristocrat probably spoke louder than his\r\ntongue; the officer dropped his hand, and after consulting some papers\r\nin his hand, walked across to consult with the unkempt gentleman in the\r\ncar.\r\n\r\n“That seems to be a similar cart and donkey,” Dorian heard him saying,\r\n“but the clothes don’t seem to fit your description of the men you saw.”\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Hibbs had extremely vague and wild recollections of the men he\r\nsaw; he could not even tell what he had done and what he had merely\r\ndreamed. If he had spoken sincerely, he would have described a sort of\r\ngreen nightmare of forests, in which he found himself in the power of an\r\nogre about twelve feet high, with scarlet flames for hair and dressed\r\nrather like Robin Hood. But a long course of what is known as “keeping\r\nthe party together” had made it as unnatural to him to tell anyone (even\r\nhimself) what he really thought about anything, as it would have been to\r\nspit—or to sing. He had at present only three motives and strong\r\nresolves: (1) not to admit that he had been drunk; (2) not to let anyone\r\nescape whom Lord Ivywood might possibly want to question; and (3) not to\r\nlose his reputation for sagacity and tact.\r\n\r\n“This party has a brown velvet suit, you see, and a fur overcoat,” the\r\nInspector continued, “and in the notes I have from you, you say the man\r\nwore a uniform.”\r\n\r\n“When we say uniform,” said Mr. Hibbs, frowning intellectually, “when we\r\nsay _uniform_, of course—we must distinguish some of our friends who\r\ndon’t quite see eye to eye with us, you know,” and he smiled with tender\r\nleniency, “some of our friends wouldn’t like it called a _uniform_\r\nperhaps. But—of course—well, it wasn’t a police uniform, for instance.\r\nHa! Ha!”\r\n\r\n“I should hope not,” said the official, shortly.\r\n\r\n“So—in a way—however,” said Hibbs, clutching his verbal talisman at\r\nlast, “it might be brown velvet in the dark.”\r\n\r\nThe Inspector replied to this helpful suggestion with some wonder. “But\r\nit was a moon, like limelight,” he protested.\r\n\r\n“Yars, yars,” cried Hibbs, in a high tone that can only be described as\r\na hasty drawl. “Yars—discolours everything of course. The flowers and\r\nthings—”\r\n\r\n“But look here,” said the Inspector, “you said the principal man’s hair\r\nwas red.”\r\n\r\n“A blond type! A blond type!” said Hibbs, waving his hand with a solemn\r\nlightness. “Reddish, yellowish, brownish sort of hair, you know.” Then\r\nhe shook his head and said with the heaviest solemnity the word was\r\ncapable of carrying, “Teutonic, purely Teutonic.”\r\n\r\nThe Inspector began to feel some wonder that, even in the confusion\r\nfollowing on Lord Ivywood’s fall, he had been put under the guidance of\r\nthis particular guide. The truth was that Leveson, once more masking his\r\nown fears under his usual parade of hurry, had found Hibbs at a table by\r\nan open window, with wild hair and sleepy eyes, picking himself up with\r\nsome sort of medicine. Finding him already fairly clear-headed in a\r\ndreary way, he had not scrupled to use the remains of his bewilderment\r\nto despatch him with the police in the first pursuit. Even the mind of a\r\nsemi-recovered drunkard, he thought, could be trusted to recognise\r\nanyone so unmistakable as the Captain.\r\n\r\nBut, though the diplomatist’s debauch was barely over, his strange, soft\r\nfear and cunning were awake. He felt fairly certain the man in the fur\r\ncoat had something to do with the mystery, as men with fur coats do not\r\ncommonly wander about with donkeys. He was afraid of offending Lord\r\nIvywood, and at the same time, afraid of exposing himself to a\r\npoliceman.\r\n\r\n“You have large discretion,” he said, gravely. “Very right you should\r\nhave large discretion in the interests of the public. I think you would\r\nbe quite authorised, for the present, in preventing the man’s escape.”\r\n\r\n“And the other man?” inquired the officer, with knitted brow. “Do you\r\nsuppose he has escaped?”\r\n\r\n“The _other_ man,” repeated Hibbs. However, regarding the distant\r\nwindmill through half-closed lids, as if this were a new fine shade\r\nintroduced into an already delicate question.\r\n\r\n“Well, hang it all,” said the police officer, “you must know whether\r\nthere were two men or one.”\r\n\r\nGradually it dawned, in a grey dawn of horror, over the brain of Hibbs\r\nthat this was what he specially couldn’t know. He had always heard, and\r\nread in comic papers, that a drunken man “sees double” and beholds two\r\nlamp-posts, one of which is (as the Higher Critic would have said)\r\npurely subjective. For all he knew (being a mere novice) inebriation\r\nmight produce the impression of the two men of his dream-like adventure,\r\nwhen in truth there had only been one.\r\n\r\n“Two men, you know—one man,” he said with a sort of moody carelessness.\r\n“Well we can go into their numbers later; they can’t have a very large\r\nfollowing.” Here he shook his head very firmly. “Quite impossible. And\r\nas the late Lord Goschen used to say, ‘You can prove anything by\r\nstatistics.’”\r\n\r\nAnd here came an interruption from the other side of the road.\r\n\r\n“And how long am I to wait here for you and your Goschens, you silly\r\ngoat,” were the intemperate wood-notes issuing from the Poet of the\r\nBirds. “I’m shot if I’ll stand this! Come along, donkey, and let’s pray\r\nfor a better adventure next time. These are very inferior specimens of\r\nyour own race.”\r\n\r\nAnd seizing the bridle of the ass again, he strode past them swiftly,\r\nand almost as if urging the animal to a gallop.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this disdainful dash for liberty was precisely what was\r\nwanting to weigh down the rocking intelligence of the Inspector on the\r\nwrong side. If Wimpole had stood still a minute or two longer, the\r\nofficial, who was no fool, might have ended in disbelieving Hibbs’s\r\nstory altogether. As it was, there was a scuffle, not without blows on\r\nboth sides, and eventually the Honourable Dorian Wimpole, donkey and\r\nall, was marched off to the village, in which there was a Police\r\nStation; in which was a temporary cell; in which a Sixth Mood was\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\nHis complaints, however, were at once so clamorous and so convincing,\r\nand his coat was so unquestionably covered with fur, that after some\r\nquestioning and cross purposes they agreed to take him in the afternoon\r\nto Ivywood House, where there was a magistrate incapacitated by a shot\r\nonly recently extracted from his leg.\r\n\r\nThey found Lord Ivywood lying on a purple ottoman, in the midst of his\r\nChinese puzzle of oriental apartments. He continued to look away as they\r\nentered, as if expecting, with Roman calm, the entrance of a recognised\r\nenemy. But Lady Enid Wimpole, who was attending to the wants of the\r\ninvalid, gave a sharp cry of astonishment; and the next moment the three\r\ncousins were looking at each other. One could almost have guessed they\r\nwere cousins, all being (as Mr. Hibbs subtly put it) a blond type. But\r\ntwo of the blond types expressed amazement, and one blond type merely\r\nrage.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry, Dorian,” said Ivywood, when he had heard the whole story.\r\n“These fanatics are capable of anything, I fear, and you very rightly\r\nresent their stealing your car—”\r\n\r\n“You are wrong, Phillip,” answered the poet, emphatically. “I do not\r\neven faintly resent their stealing my car. What I do resent is the\r\ncontinued existence on God’s earth of this Fool” (pointing to the\r\nserious Hibbs) “and of that Fool” (pointing to the Inspector) “and—yes,\r\nby thunder, of _that_ Fool, too” (and he pointed straight at Lord\r\nIvywood). “And I tell you frankly, Phillip, if there really are, as you\r\nsay, two men who are bent on smashing your schemes and making your life\r\na hell—I am very happy to put my car at their disposal. And now I’m\r\noff.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll stop to dinner?” inquired Ivywood, with frigid forgiveness.\r\n\r\n“No, thanks,” said the disappearing bard, “I’m going up to town.”\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Mood of Dorian Wimpole had a grand finale at the Café Royal,\r\nand consisted largely of oysters.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                         THE POET IN PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nDURING the singular entrance and exit of Dorian Wimpole, M.P., J.P.,\r\netc., Lady Joan was looking out of the magic casements of that turret\r\nroom which was now literally, and not only poetically, the last limit of\r\nIvywood House. The old broken hole and black staircase up which the lost\r\ndog Quoodle used to come and go, had long ago been sealed up and\r\ncemented with a wall of exquisite Eastern workmanship. All through the\r\npatterns Lord Ivywood had preserved and repeated the principle that no\r\nanimal shape must appear. But, like all lucid dogmatists, he perceived\r\nall the liberties his dogma allowed him. And he had irradiated this\r\nremote end of Ivywood with sun and moon and solar and starry systems,\r\nwith the Milky Way for a dado and a few comets for comic relief. The\r\nthing was well done of its kind (as were all the things that Phillip\r\nIvywood got done for him); and if all the windows of the turret were\r\nclosed with their peacock curtains, a poet with anything like a Hibbsian\r\nappreciation of the family champagne might almost fancy he was looking\r\nout across the sea on a night crowded with stars. And (what was yet more\r\nimportant) even Misysra (that exact thinker) could not call the moon a\r\nlive animal without falling into idolatry.\r\n\r\nBut Joan, looking out of real windows on a real sky and sea, thought no\r\nmore about the astronomical wall-paper than about any other wall-paper.\r\nShe was asking herself in sullen emotionalism, and for the thousandth\r\ntime, a question she had never been able to decide. It was the final\r\nchoice between an ambition and a memory. And there was this heavy weight\r\nin the scale: that the ambition would probably materialise, and the\r\nmemory probably wouldn’t. It has been the same weight in the same scale\r\na million times, since Satan became the prince of this world. But the\r\nevening stars were strengthening over the old sea-shore, and they also\r\nwanted weighing like diamonds.\r\n\r\nAs once before at the same stage of brooding, she heard behind her the\r\nswish of Lady Enid’s skirts, that never came so fast save for serious\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n“Joan! Please do come! Nobody but you, I do believe, could move him.”\r\nJoan looked at Lady Enid and realised that the lady was close on crying.\r\nShe turned a trifle pale and asked quietly for the question. “Phillip\r\nsays he’s going to London now, with that leg and all,” cried Enid, “and\r\nhe won’t let us say a word.”\r\n\r\n“But how did it all happen?” asked Joan.\r\n\r\nLady Enid Wimpole was quite incapable of explaining how it all happened,\r\nso the task must for the moment devolve on the author. The simple fact\r\nwas that Ivywood in the course of turning over magazines on his sofa,\r\nhappened to look at a paper from the Midlands.\r\n\r\n“The Turkish news,” said Mr. Leveson, rather nervously, “is on the other\r\nside of the page.”\r\n\r\nBut Lord Ivywood continued to look at the side of the paper that did not\r\ncontain the Turkish news, with the same dignity of lowered eyelids and\r\nunconscious brow with which he had looked at the Captain’s message when\r\nJoan found him by the turret.\r\n\r\nOn the page covered merely with casual, provincial happenings was a\r\nparagraph, “Echo of Pebblewick Mystery. Reported Reappearance of the\r\nVanishing Inn.” Underneath was printed, in smaller letters:\r\n\r\n    “An almost incredible report from Wyddington announces that the\r\n    mysterious ‘Sign of the Old Ship’ has once more been seen in\r\n    this country; though it has long been relegated by scientific\r\n    investigators to the limbo of old rustic superstitions.\r\n    According to the local version, Mr. Simmons, a dairyman of\r\n    Wyddington, was serving in his shop when two motorists entered,\r\n    one of them asking for a glass of milk. They were in the most\r\n    impenetrable motoring panoply, with darkened goggles and\r\n    waterproof collars turned up, so that nothing can be recalled of\r\n    them personally, except that one was a person of unusual\r\n    stature. In a few moments, this latter individual went out of\r\n    the shop again and returned with a miserable specimen out of the\r\n    street, one of the tattered loafers that linger about our most\r\n    prosperous towns, tramping the streets all night and even\r\n    begging in defiance of the police. The filth and disease of the\r\n    creature were so squalid that Mr. Simmons at first refused to\r\n    serve him with the glass of milk which the taller motorist\r\n    wished to provide for him. At length, however, Mr. Simmons\r\n    consented, and was immediately astonished by an incident against\r\n    which he certainly had a more assured right to protest.\r\n\r\n    “The taller motorist, saying to the loafer, ‘but, man, you’re\r\n    blue in the face,’ made a species of signs to the smaller\r\n    motorist, who thereupon appears to have pierced a sort of\r\n    cylindrical trunk or chest that seemed to be his only luggage,\r\n    and drawn from it a few drops of a yellow liquid which he\r\n    deliberately dropped into the ragged creature’s milk. It was\r\n    afterward discovered to be rum, and the protests of Mr. Simmons\r\n    may be imagined. The tall motorist, however, warmly defended his\r\n    action, having apparently some wild idea that he was doing an\r\n    act of kindness. ‘Why, I found the man nearly fainting,’ he\r\n    said. ‘If you’d picked him off a raft, he couldn’t be more\r\n    collapsed with cold and sickness; and if you’d picked him off a\r\n    raft you’d have given him rum—yes, by St. Patrick, if you were a\r\n    bloody pirate and made him walk the plank afterward.’ Mr.\r\n    Simmons replied with dignity, that he did not know how it was\r\n    with rafts, and could not permit such language in his shop. He\r\n    added that he would lay himself open to a police prosecution if\r\n    he permitted the consumption of alcohol in his shop; since he\r\n    did not display a sign. The motorist then made the amazing\r\n    reply, ‘But you _do_ display a sign, you jolly old man. Did you\r\n    think I couldn’t find my way to the sign of The Old Ship, you\r\n    sly boots?’ Mr. Simmons was now fully convinced of the\r\n    intoxication of his visitors, and refusing a glass of rum rather\r\n    boisterously offered him, went outside his shop to look round\r\n    for a policeman. To his surprise he found the officer engaged in\r\n    dispersing a considerable crowd, which was staring up at some\r\n    object behind him. On looking round (he states in his\r\n    deposition) he ‘saw what was undoubtedly one of the low tavern\r\n    signs at one time common in England.’ He was wholly unable to\r\n    explain its presence outside his premises, and as it undoubtedly\r\n    legalised the motorist’s action, the police declined to move in\r\n    the matter.\r\n\r\n    “Later. The two motorists have apparently left the town,\r\n    unmolested, in a small second-hand two-seater. There is no clue\r\n    to their destination, except it be indicated by a single\r\n    incident. It appears that when they were waiting for the second\r\n    glass of milk, one of them drew attention to a milk-can of a\r\n    shape seemingly unfamiliar to him, which was, of course, the\r\n    Mountain Milk now so much recommended by doctors. The taller\r\n    motorist (who seemed in every way strangely ignorant of modern\r\n    science and social life) asked his companion where it came from,\r\n    receiving, of course, the reply that it is manufactured in the\r\n    model village of Peaceways, under the personal superintendence\r\n    of its distinguished and philanthropic inventor, Dr. Meadows.\r\n    Upon this the taller person, who appeared highly irresponsible,\r\n    actually bought the whole can; observing, as he tucked it under\r\n    his arm, that it would help him to remember the address.\r\n\r\n    “Later. Our readers will be glad to hear that the legend of ‘The\r\n    Old Ship’ sign has once more yielded to the wholesome scepticism\r\n    of science. Our representative reached Wyddington after the\r\n    practical jokers, or whatever they were, had left; but he\r\n    searched the whole frontage of Mr. Simmons’s shop, and we are in\r\n    a position to assure the public that there is no trace of the\r\n    alleged sign.”\r\n\r\nLord Ivywood laid down the newspaper and looked at the rich and\r\nserpentine embroideries on the wall with the expression that a great\r\ngeneral might have if he saw a chance of really ruining his enemy, if he\r\nwould also ruin all his previous plan of campaign. His pallid and\r\nclassic profile was as immovable as a cameo; but anyone who had known\r\nhim at all would have known that his brain was going like a motor car\r\nthat has broken the speed limit long ago.\r\n\r\nThen he turned his head and said, “Please tell Hicks to bring round the\r\nlong blue car in half an hour; it can be fitted up for a sofa. And ask\r\nthe gardener to cut a pole of about four feet nine inches, and put a\r\ncross-piece for a crutch. I’m going up to London tonight.”\r\n\r\nMr. Leveson’s lower jaw literally fell with astonishment.\r\n\r\n“The Doctor said three weeks,” he said. “If I may ask it, where are you\r\ngoing?”\r\n\r\n“St. Stephens, Westminster,” answered Ivywood.\r\n\r\n“Surely,” said Mr. Leveson, “I could take a message.”\r\n\r\n“You could take a message,” assented Ivywood, “I’m afraid they would not\r\nallow you to make a speech.”\r\n\r\nIt was a moment or two afterward that Enid Wimpole had come into the\r\nroom, and striven in vain to shake his decision. Then it was that Joan\r\nhad been brought out of the turret and saw Phillip standing, sustained\r\nupon a crutch of garden timber; and admired him as she had never admired\r\nhim before. While he was being helped downstairs, while he was being\r\npropped in the car with such limited comfort as was possible, she did\r\nreally feel in him something worthy of his ancient roots, worthy of such\r\nhills and of such a sea. For she felt God’s wind from nowhere which is\r\ncalled the Will; and is man’s only excuse upon this earth. In the small\r\ntoot of the starting motor she could hear a hundred trumpets, such as\r\nmight have called her ancestors and his to the glories of the Third\r\nCrusade.\r\n\r\nSuch imaginary military honours were not, at least in the strategic\r\nsense, undeserved. Lord Ivywood really had seen the whole map of the\r\nsituation in front of him, and swiftly formed a plan to meet it, in a\r\nmanner not unworthy of Napoleon. The realities of the situation unrolled\r\nthemselves before him, and his mind was marking them one by one as with\r\na pencil.\r\n\r\nFirst, he knew that Dalroy would probably go to the Model Village. It\r\nwas just the sort of place he would go to. He knew Dalroy was almost\r\nconstitutionally incapable of not kicking up some kind of row in a place\r\nof that kind.\r\n\r\nSecond, he knew that if he missed Dalroy at this address, it was very\r\nlikely to be his last address; he and Mr. Pump were quite clever enough\r\nto leave no more hints behind.\r\n\r\nThird, he guessed, by careful consideration of map and clock, that they\r\ncould not get to so remote a region in so cheap a car under something\r\nlike two days, nor do anything very conclusive in less than three. Thus,\r\nhe had just time to turn round in.\r\n\r\nFourth, he realised that ever since that day when Dalroy swung round the\r\nsign-board and smote the policeman into the ditch, Dalroy had swung\r\nround the Ivywood Act on Lord Ivywood. He (Lord Ivywood) had thought,\r\nand might well have thought rightly, that by restricting the old\r\nsign-posts to a few places so select that they can afford to be\r\neccentric, and forbidding such artistic symbols to all other places, he\r\ncould sweep fermented liquor for all practical purposes out of the land.\r\nThe arrangement was exactly that at which all such legislation is\r\nconsciously or unconsciously aiming. A sign-board could be a favour\r\ngranted by the governing class to itself. If a gentleman wished to claim\r\nthe liberties of a Bohemian, the path would be open. If a Bohemian\r\nwished to claim the liberties of a gentleman, the path would be shut.\r\nSo, gradually, Lord Ivywood had thought, the old signs which can alone\r\nsell alcohol, will dwindle down to mere curiosities, like Audit Ale or\r\nthe Mead that may still be found in the New Forest. The calculation was\r\nby no means unstatesmanlike. But, like many other statesmanlike\r\ncalculations, it did not take into account the idea of dead wood walking\r\nabout. So long as his flying foes might set up their sign anywhere, it\r\nmattered little whether the result was enjoyment or disappointment for\r\nthe populace. In either case it must mean constant scandal or riot. If\r\nthere was one thing worse than the appearance of “The Old Ship” it was\r\nits disappearance.\r\n\r\nHe realised that his own law was letting them loose every time; for the\r\nlocal authorities hesitated to act on the spot, in defiance of a symbol\r\nnow so exclusive and therefore impressive. He realised that the law must\r\nbe altered. Must be altered at once. Must be altered, if possible,\r\nbefore the fugitives broke away from the Model Village of Peaceways.\r\n\r\nHe realised that it was Thursday. This was the day on which any private\r\nmember of Parliament could introduce any private bill of the kind called\r\n“non-contentious,” and pass it without a division, so long as no\r\nparticular member made any particular fuss. He realised that it was\r\nimprobable that any particular member would make any particular fuss\r\nabout Lord Ivywood’s own improvement on Lord Ivywood’s own Act.\r\n\r\nFinally, he realised that the whole case could be met by so slight an\r\nimprovement as this. Change the words of the Act (which he knew by\r\nheart, as happier men might know a song): “If such sign be present\r\nliquids containing alcohol can be sold on the premises,” to these other\r\nwords: “Liquids containing alcohol can be sold, if previously preserved\r\nfor three days on the premises”; it was mate in a few moves. Parliament\r\ncould never reject or even examine so slight an emendation. And the\r\nrevolution of “The Old Ship” and the late King of Ithaca would be\r\ncrushed for ever.\r\n\r\nIt does undoubtedly show, as we have said, something Napoleonic in the\r\nman’s mind that the whole of this excellent and even successful plan was\r\ncomplete long before he saw the great glowing clock on the towers of\r\nWestminster; and knew he was in time.\r\n\r\nIt was unfortunate, perhaps, that about the same time, or not long\r\nafter, another gentleman of the same rank, and indirectly of the same\r\nfamily, having left the restaurant in Regent Street and the tangle of\r\nPiccadilly, had drifted serenely down Whitehall, and had seen the same\r\ngreat golden goblin’s eye on the tall tower of St. Stephen.\r\n\r\nThe Poet of the Birds, like most æsthetes, had known as little of the\r\nreal town as he had of the real country. But he had remembered a good\r\nplace for supper; and as he passed certain great cold clubs, built of\r\nstone and looking like Assyrian Sarcophagi, he remembered that he\r\nbelonged to many of them. And so when he saw afar off, sitting above the\r\nriver, what has been very erroneously described as the best club in\r\nLondon, he suddenly remembered that he belonged to that too. He could\r\nnot at the moment recall what constituency in South England it was that\r\nhe sat for; but he knew he could walk into the place if he wanted to. He\r\nmight not so have expressed the matter, but he knew that in an oligarchy\r\nthings go by respect for persons and not for claims; by visiting cards\r\nand not by voting cards. He had not been near the place for years, being\r\npermanently paired against a famous Patriot who had accepted an\r\nimportant government appointment in a private madhouse. Even in his\r\nsilliest days, he had never pretended to feel any respect for modern\r\npolitics, and made all haste to put his “leaders” and the mad patriot’s\r\n“leaders” on the well selected list of the creatures whom man forgets.\r\nHe had made one really eloquent speech in the House (on the subject of\r\ngorillas), and then found he was speaking against his party. It was an\r\nindescribable sort of place, anyhow. Even Lord Ivywood did not go to it\r\nexcept to do some business that could be done nowhere else; as was the\r\ncase that night.\r\n\r\nIvywood was what is called a peer by courtesy; his place was in the\r\nCommons, and for the time being on the Opposition side. But, though he\r\nvisited the House but seldom, he knew far too much about it to go into\r\nthe Chamber itself. He limped into the Smoking Room (though he did not\r\nsmoke), procured a needless cigarette and a much-needed sheet of\r\nnote-paper, and composed a curt but careful note to the one member of\r\nthe government whom he knew must be in the House. Having sent it up to\r\nhim, he waited.\r\n\r\nOutside, Mr. Dorian Wimpole also waited, leaning on the parapet of\r\nWestminster Bridge and looking down the river. He was becoming one with\r\nthe oysters in a more solemn and solid sense than he had hitherto\r\nconceived possible, and also with a strictly Vegetarian beverage which\r\nbears the noble and starry name of Nuits. He felt at peace with all\r\nthings, even in a manner with politics. It was one of those magic hours\r\nof evening when the red and golden lights of men are already lit along\r\nthe river, and look like the lights of goblins, but daylight still\r\nlingers in a cold and delicate green. He felt about the river something\r\nof that smiling and glorious sadness which two Englishmen have expressed\r\nunder the figure of the white wood of an old ship fading like a phantom;\r\nTurner, in painting, and Henry Newbolt, in poetry. He had come back to\r\nearth like a man fallen from the moon; he was at bottom not only a poet\r\nbut a patriot, and a patriot is always a little sad. Yet his melancholy\r\nwas mixed up with that immutable yet meaningless faith which few\r\nEnglishmen, even in modern times, fail to feel at the unexpected sight\r\neither of Westminster or of that height on which stands the temple of\r\nSt. Paul.\r\n\r\n                    “While flows the sacred river,\r\n                     While stands the sacred hill,”\r\n\r\nhe murmured in some schoolboy echo of the ballad of Lake Regillus,\r\n\r\n            “While flows the sacred river,\r\n             While stands the sacred hill,\r\n             The proud old pantaloons and nincompoops,\r\n             Who yawn at the very length of their own lies\r\n             in that accursed sanhedrim where\r\n             people put each other’s hats on in a poisonous\r\n             room with no more windows than hell\r\n             Shall have such honour still.”\r\n\r\nRelieved by this rendering of Macaulay in the style known among his\r\ncultured friends as _vers libre_, or poesy set free from the shackles of\r\nformal metre, he strolled toward the members’ entrance and went in.\r\n\r\nLacking Lord Ivywood’s experience, he strolled into the Common’s Chamber\r\nitself and sat down on a green bench, under the impression that the\r\nHouse was not sitting. He was, however, gradually able to distinguish\r\nsome six or eight drowsy human forms from the seats on which they sat;\r\nand to hear a senile voice with an Essex accent, saying, all on one\r\nnote, and without beginning or end, in a manner which it is quite\r\nimpossible to punctuate,\r\n\r\n    “... no wish at all that this proposal should be regarded except\r\n    in the right way and have tried to put it in the right way and\r\n    cannot think the honourable member was altogether adding to his\r\n    reputation in putting it in what those who think with me must of\r\n    course consider the wrong way and I for one am free to say that\r\n    if in his desire to settle this great question he takes this\r\n    hasty course and this revolutionary course about slate pencils\r\n    he may not be able to prevent the extremists behind him from\r\n    applying it to lead pencils and while I should be the last to\r\n    increase the heat and the excitement and the personalities of\r\n    this debate if I could possibly help it I must confess that in\r\n    my opinion the honourable gentleman has himself encouraged that\r\n    heat and personality in a manner that he now doubtless regrets I\r\n    have no desire to use abusive terms indeed you Mr. Speaker would\r\n    not allow me of course to use abusive terms but I must tell the\r\n    honourable member face to face that the perambulators with which\r\n    he has twitted me cannot be germane to this discussion I should\r\n    be the last person....”\r\n\r\nDorian Wimpole had softly risen to go, when he was arrested by the sight\r\nof someone sliding into the House and handing a note to the solitary\r\nyoung man with heavy eyelids who was at that moment governing all\r\nEngland from the Treasury Bench. Seeing him go out, Dorian had a\r\nsickening sweetness of hope (as he might have said in his earlier\r\npoems), that something intelligible might happen after all, and followed\r\nhim out almost with alacrity.\r\n\r\nThe solitary and sleepy governor of Great Britain went down into the\r\nlower crypts of its temple of freedom and turned into an apartment where\r\nWimpole was astonished to see his cousin Ivywood sitting at a little\r\ntable with a large crutch leaning beside him, as serene as Long John\r\nSilver. The young man with the heavy eyelids sat down opposite him and\r\nthey had a conversation which Wimpole, of course, did not hear. He\r\nwithdrew into an adjoining room where he managed to procure coffee and a\r\nliqueur; an excellent liqueur which he had forgotten and of which he had\r\nmore than one glass.\r\n\r\nBut he had so posted himself that Ivywood could not come out without\r\npassing him, and he waited for what might happen with exquisite\r\npatience. The only thing that seemed to him queer was that every now and\r\nthen a bell rang in several rooms at once. And whenever the bell rang,\r\nLord Ivywood nodded, as if he were part of the electrical machinery. And\r\nwhenever Lord Ivywood nodded the young man turned and sped upstairs like\r\na mountaineer, returning in a short time to resume the conversation. On\r\nthe third occasion the poet began to observe that many others from the\r\nother rooms could be heard running upstairs at the sound of this bell,\r\nand returning with the slightly less rapid step which expresses relief\r\nafter a duty done. Yet did he not know that this duty was Representative\r\nGovernment; and that it is thus that the cry of Cumberland or Cornwall\r\ncan come to the ears of an English King.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the sleepy young man sprang erect, uninspired by any bell, and\r\nstrode out once more. The poet could not help hearing him say as he left\r\nthe table, jotting down something with a pencil: “Alcohol can be sold if\r\npreviously preserved for three days on the premises. I think we can do\r\nit, but you can’t come on for half an hour.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he darted upstairs again, and when Dorian saw Ivywood come\r\nout laboriously, afterward, on his large country crutch, he had exactly\r\nthe same revulsion in his favour that Joan had had. Jumping up from his\r\ntable, which was in one of the private dining-rooms, he touched the\r\nother on the elbow and said:\r\n\r\n“I want to apologise to you, Phillip, for my rudeness this afternoon.\r\nHonestly, I am sorry. Pinewoods and prison-cells try a man’s temper, but\r\nI had no rag of excuse for not seeing that for neither of them were you\r\nto blame. I’d no notion you were coming up to town tonight; with your\r\nleg and all. You mustn’t knock yourself up like this. Do sit down a\r\nminute.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him that the bleak face of Phillip softened a little; how\r\nfar he really softened will never be known until such men as he are\r\nunderstood by their fellows. It is certain that he carefully unhooked\r\nhimself from his crutch and sat down opposite his cousin. Whereupon his\r\ncousin struck the table so that it rang like a dinner-bell and called\r\nout, “Waiter!” as if he were in a crowded restaurant. Then, before Lord\r\nIvywood could protest, he said:\r\n\r\n“It’s awfully jolly that we’ve met. I suppose you’ve come up to make a\r\nspeech. I _should_ like to hear it. We haven’t always agreed; but, by\r\nGod, if there’s anything good left in literature it’s your speeches\r\nreported in a newspaper. That thing of yours that ended, ‘death and the\r\nlast shutting of the iron doors of defeat’—Why you must go back to\r\nStrafford’s last speech for such English. Do let me hear your speech!\r\nI’ve got a seat upstairs, you know.”\r\n\r\n“If you wish it,” said Ivywood hurriedly, “but I shan’t make much of a\r\nspeech tonight.” And he looked at the wall behind Wimpole’s head with\r\nthunderous wrinkles thickening on his brow. It was essential to his\r\nbrilliant and rapid scheme, of course, that the Commons should make no\r\ncomment at all on his little alteration in the law.\r\n\r\nAn attendant hovered near in response to the demand for a waiter, and\r\nwas much impressed by the presence and condition of Lord Ivywood. But as\r\nthat exalted cripple resolutely refused anything in the way of liquor,\r\nhis cousin was so kind as to have a little more himself, and resumed his\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\n“It’s about this public-house affair of yours, I suppose. I’d like to\r\nhear you speak on that. P’raps I’ll speak myself. I’ve been thinking\r\nabout it a good deal all day, and a good deal of last night, too. Now,\r\nhere’s what I should say to the House, if I were you. To begin with, can\r\nyou abolish the public-house? Are you _important_ enough now to abolish\r\nthe public-house? Whether it’s right or wrong, can you in the long run\r\nprevent haymakers having ale any more than you can prevent me having\r\nthis glass of Chartreuse?”\r\n\r\nThe attendant, hearing the word, once more drew near; but heard no\r\nfurther order; or, rather, the orders he heard were such as he was less\r\nable to cope with.\r\n\r\n“Remember the curate!” said Dorian, abstractedly shaking his head at the\r\nfunctionary, “remember the sensible little High-Church curate, who when\r\nasked for a Temperance Sermon preached on the text ‘Suffer us not to be\r\noverwhelmed in the water-floods.’ Indeed, indeed, Phillip, you are in\r\ndeeper waters than you know. _You_ will abolish ale! _You_ will make\r\nKent forget hop-poles, and Devonshire forget cider! The fate of the Inn\r\nis to be settled in that hot little room upstairs! Take care its fate\r\nand yours are not settled in the Inn. Take care Englishmen don’t sit in\r\njudgment on you as they do on many another corpse at an inquest—at a\r\ncommon public-house! Take care that the one tavern that is really\r\nneglected and shut up and passed like a house of pestilence is not the\r\ntavern in which I drink tonight, and that merely because it is the worst\r\ntavern on the King’s highway. Take care this place where we sit does not\r\nget a name like any pub where sailors are hocussed or girls debauched.\r\nThat is what I shall say to them,” said he, rising cheerfully, “that’s\r\nwhat I shall say. See you to it,” he cried with sudden passion and\r\napparently to the waiter, “see you to it if the sign that is destroyed\r\nis not the sign of ‘The Old Ship’ but the sign of the Mace and Bauble,\r\nand, in the words of a highly historical brewer, if we see a dog bark at\r\nyour going.”\r\n\r\nLord Ivywood was observing him with a deathly quietude; another idea had\r\ncome into his fertile mind. He knew his cousin, though excited, was not\r\nin the least intoxicated; he knew he was quite capable of making a\r\nspeech and even a good one. He knew that any speech, good or bad, would\r\nwreck his whole plan and send the wild inn flying again. But the orator\r\nhad resumed his seat and drained his glass, passing a hand across his\r\nbrow. And he remembered that a man who keeps a vigil in a wood all night\r\nand drinks wine on the following evening is liable to an accident that\r\nis not drunkenness, but something much healthier.\r\n\r\n“I suppose your speech will come on pretty soon,” said Dorian, looking\r\nat the table. “You’ll let me know when it does, of course. Really and\r\ntruly, I don’t want to miss it. And I’ve forgotten all the ways here,\r\nand feel pretty tired. You’ll let me know?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Lord Ivywood.\r\n\r\nStillness fell along all the rooms until Lord Ivywood broke it by\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n“Debate is a most necessary thing; but there are times when it rather\r\nimpedes than assists parliamentary government.”\r\n\r\nHe received no reply. Dorian still sat as if looking at the table, but\r\nhis eyelids had lightly fallen; he was asleep. Almost at the same moment\r\nthe Member of Government, who was nearly asleep, appeared at the\r\nentrance of the long room and made some sort of weary signal.\r\n\r\nPhillip Ivywood raised himself on his crutch and stood for a moment\r\nlooking at the sleeping man. Then he and his crutch trailed out of the\r\nlong room, leaving the sleeping man behind. Nor was that the only thing\r\nthat he left behind. He also left behind an unlighted cigarette and his\r\nhonour and all the England of his father’s; everything that could really\r\ndistinguish that high house beside the river from any tavern for the\r\nhocussing of sailors. He went upstairs and did his business in twenty\r\nminutes in the only speech he had ever delivered without any trace of\r\neloquence. And from that hour forth he was the naked fanatic; and could\r\nfeed on nothing but the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n                       THE REPUBLIC OF PEACEWAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nIN a hamlet round about Windermere, let us say, or somewhere in\r\nWordsworth’s country, there could be found a cottage, in which could be\r\nfound a cottager. So far all is as it should be; and the visitor would\r\nfirst be conscious of a hearty and even noisy elderly man, with an apple\r\nface and a short white beard. This person would then loudly proffer to\r\nthe visitor the opportunity of seeing his father, a somewhat more\r\nelderly man, with a somewhat longer white beard, but still “up and\r\nabout.” And these two together would then initiate the neophyte into the\r\njoys of the society of a grandfather, who was more than a hundred years\r\nold, and still very proud of the fact.\r\n\r\nThis miracle, it seemed, had been worked entirely on milk. The subject\r\nof this diet the oldest of the three men continued to discuss in\r\nenormous detail. For the rest, it might be said that his pleasures were\r\npurely arithmetical. Some men count their years with dismay, and he\r\ncounted his with a juvenile vanity. Some men collect stamps or coins,\r\nand he collected days. Newspaper men interviewed him about the historic\r\ntimes through which he had lived, without eliciting anything whatever;\r\nexcept that he had apparently taken to an exclusive milk diet at about\r\nthe age when most of us leave it off. Asked if he was alive in 1815, he\r\nsaid that was the very year he found it wasn’t any milk, but must be\r\nMountain Milk, like Dr. Meadows says. Nor would his calculating creed of\r\nlife have allowed him to understand you if you had said that in a\r\nmeadowland oversea that lies before the city of Brussels, boys of his\r\nold school in that year gained the love of the gods and died young.\r\n\r\nIt was the philanthropic Dr. Meadows, of course, who discovered this\r\ndeathless tribe, and erected on it the whole of his great dietetic\r\nphilosophy, to say nothing of the houses and dairies of Peaceways. He\r\nattracted many pupils and backers among the wealthy and influential;\r\nyoung men who were, so to speak, training for extreme old age, infant\r\nold men, embryo nonagenarians. It would be an exaggeration to say that\r\nthey watched joyfully for the first white hair as Fascination Fledgeby\r\nwatched for his first whisker; but it is quite true to say that they\r\nseemed to have scorned the beauty of woman and the feasting of friends\r\nand, above all, the old idea of death with glory; in comparison with\r\nthis vision of the sports of second childhood.\r\n\r\nPeaceways was in its essential plan much like what we call a Garden\r\nCity; a ring of buildings where the work people did their work, with a\r\npretty ornamental town in the centre, where they lived in the open\r\ncountry outside. This was no doubt much healthier than the factory\r\nsystem in the great towns and may have partly accounted for the serene\r\nexpression of Dr. Meadows and his friends, if any part of the credit can\r\nbe spared from the splendours of Mountain Milk. The place lay far from\r\nthe common highways of England, and its inhabitants were enabled to\r\nenjoy their quiet skies and level woods almost undisturbed, and fully\r\nabsorb whatever may be valuable in the Meadows method and view; until\r\none day a small and very dirty motor drove into the middle of their\r\ntown. It stopped beside one of those triangular islets of grass that are\r\ncommon at forked roads, and two men in goggles, one tall and the other\r\nshort, got out and stood on the central space of grass, as if they were\r\nbuffoons about to do tricks. As, indeed, they were.\r\n\r\nBefore entering the town they had stopped by a splendid mountain stream\r\nquickening and thickening rapidly into a river; unhelmed and otherwise\r\neased themselves, eaten a little bread bought at Wyddington and drank\r\nthe water of the widening current which opened on the valley of\r\nPeaceways.\r\n\r\n“I’m beginning quite to like water,” said the taller of the two knights.\r\n“I used to think it a most dangerous drink. In theory, of course, it\r\nought only to be given to people who are fainting. It’s really good for\r\nthem, much better than brandy. Besides, think of wasting good brandy on\r\npeople who are fainting! But I don’t go so far as I did; I shouldn’t\r\ninsist on a doctor’s prescription before I allow people water. That was\r\nthe too severe morality of youth; that was my innocence and goodness. I\r\nthought that if I fell once, water-drinking might become a habit. But I\r\ndo see the good side of water now. How good it is when you’re really\r\nthirsty, how it glitters and gurgles! How alive it is! After all, it’s\r\nthe best of drinks, after the other. As it says in the song:\r\n\r\n                “Feast on wine or fast on water,\r\n                   And your honour shall stand sure;\r\n                 God Almighty’s son and daughter,\r\n                   He the valiant, she the pure.\r\n                 If an angel out of heaven\r\n                   Brings you other things to drink,\r\n                 Thank him for his kind intentions,\r\n                   Go and pour them down the sink.\r\n\r\n                “Tea is like the East he grows in,\r\n                   A great yellow Mandarin,\r\n                 With urbanity of manner,\r\n                   And unconsciousness of sin;\r\n                 All the women, like a harem,\r\n                   At his pig-tail troop along,\r\n                 And, like all the East he grows in,\r\n                   He is Poison when he’s strong.\r\n\r\n                “Tea, although an Oriental,\r\n                   Is a gentleman at least;\r\n                 Cocoa is a cad and coward,\r\n                   Cocoa is a vulgar beast;\r\n                 Cocoa is a dull, disloyal,\r\n                   Lying, crawling cad and clown,\r\n                 And may very well be grateful\r\n                   To the fool that takes him down.\r\n\r\n                “As for all the windy waters,\r\n                   They were rained like trumpets down,\r\n                 When good drink had been dishonoured\r\n                   By the tipplers of the town.\r\n                 When red wine had brought red ruin,\r\n                   And the death-dance of our times,\r\n                 Heaven sent us Soda Water\r\n                   As a torment for our crimes.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my soul, this water tastes quite nice. I wonder what vintage now?”\r\nand he smacked his lips with solemnity. “It tastes just like the year\r\n1881 tasted.”\r\n\r\n“You can fancy anything in the tasting way,” returned his shorter\r\ncompanion. “Mr. Jack, who was always up to his tricks, did serve plain\r\nwater in those little glasses they drink liqueurs out of, and everyone\r\nswore it was a delicious liqueur, and wanted to know where they could\r\nget it—all except old Admiral Guffin, who said it tasted too strong of\r\nolives. But water’s much the best for our game, certainly.”\r\n\r\nPatrick nodded, and then said:\r\n\r\n“I doubt if I could do it, if it weren’t for the comfort of looking at\r\nthat,” and he kicked the rum-keg, “and feeling we shall have a good swig\r\nat it some day. It feels like a fairy-tale, carrying that about—as if\r\nrum were a pirate’s treasure, as if it were molten gold. Besides, we can\r\nhave such fun with it with other people—what was that joke I thought of\r\nthis morning? Oh, I remember! Where’s that milk-can of mine?”\r\n\r\nFor the next twenty minutes he was industriously occupied with his\r\nmilk-can and the cask; Pump watching him with an interest amounting to\r\nanxiety. Lifting his head, however, at the end of that time, he knotted\r\nhis red brows and said, “What’s that?”\r\n\r\n“What’s what?” asked the other traveller.\r\n\r\n“That!” said Captain Patrick Dalroy, and pointed to a figure approaching\r\non the road parallel to the river, “I mean, what’s it for?”\r\n\r\nThe figure had a longish beard and very long hair falling far below its\r\nshoulders. It had a serious and steadfast expression. It was dressed in\r\nwhat the inexperienced Mr. Pump at first took to be its night-gown; but\r\nafterward learned to be its complete goats’ hair tunic, unmixed even\r\nwith a thread of the destructive and deadly wool of the sheep. It had no\r\nboots on its feet. It walked very swiftly to a particular turn of the\r\nstream and then turned very sharply (since it had accomplished its\r\nconstitutional), and walked back toward the perfect town of Peaceways.\r\n\r\n“I suppose it’s somebody from that milk place,” said Humphrey Pump,\r\nindulgently. “They seem to be pretty mad.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t mind that so much,” said Dalroy, “I’m mad myself sometimes. But\r\na madman has only one merit and last link with God. A madman is always\r\nlogical. Now what is the logical connection between living on milk and\r\nwearing your hair long? Most of us lived on milk when we had no hair at\r\nall. How do they connect it up? Are there any heads even for a synopsis?\r\nIs it, say, ‘milk—water—shaving-water—shaving—hair?’ Is it\r\n‘milk—kindness—unkindness—convicts—hair?’ What is the logical connection\r\nbetween having too much hair and having far too few boots? What _can_ it\r\nbe? Is it ‘hair—hair-trunk—leather-trunk—leather-boots?’ Is it\r\n‘hair—beard—oysters—seaside—paddling—no boots?’ Man is liable to\r\nerr—especially when every mistake he makes is called a movement—but why\r\nshould all the lunacies live together?”\r\n\r\n“Because all the lunatics should live together,” said Humphrey, “and if\r\nyou’d seen what happened up at Crampton, with the farming-out idea,\r\nyou’d know. It’s all very well, Captain; but if people can prevent a\r\nguest of great importance being buried up to the neck in farm manure,\r\nthey will. They will, really.” He coughed almost apologetically. He was\r\nabout to attempt a resumption of the conversation, when he saw his\r\ncompanion slap the milk-can and keg back into the car, and get into it\r\nhimself. “You drive,” he said, “drive me where those things live; you\r\nknow, Hump.”\r\n\r\nThey did not, however, arrive in the civic centre of such things without\r\nyet another delay. They left the river and followed the man with the\r\nlong hair and the goatskin frock; and he stopped as it happened at a\r\nhouse on the outskirts of the village. The adventurers stopped also, out\r\nof curiosity, and were at first relieved to see the man almost instantly\r\nreappear, having transacted his business with a quickness that seemed\r\nincredible. A second glance showed them it was not the man, but another\r\nman dressed exactly like him. A few minutes more of inquisitive delay,\r\nshowed them many of the kilty and goatish sect going in and out of this\r\nparticular place, each clad in his innocent uniform.\r\n\r\n“This must be the temple and chapel,” muttered Patrick, “it must be here\r\nthey sacrifice a glass of milk to a cow, or whatever it is they do.\r\nWell, the joke is pretty obvious, but we must wait for a lull in the\r\ncrowding of the congregation.”\r\n\r\nWhen the last long-haired phantom had faded up the road, Dalroy sprang\r\nfrom the car and drove the sign-board deep into the earth with savage\r\nviolence, and then very quietly knocked at the door.\r\n\r\nThe apparent owner of the place, of whom the two last of the long-haired\r\nand bare-footed idealists were taking a rather hurried farewell, was a\r\nman curiously ill-fitted for the part he seemed cast for in the only\r\npossible plot.\r\n\r\nBoth Pump and Dalroy thought they had never seen a man look so sullen.\r\nHis face was of the rubicund sort that does not suggest jollity, but\r\nmerely a stagnant indigestion in the head. His mustache hung heavy and\r\ndark, his brows yet heavier and darker. Dalroy had seen something of the\r\nsort on the faces of defeated people disgracefully forced into\r\nsubmission, but he could not make head or tail of it in connection with\r\nthe priggish perfections of Peaceways. It was all the odder because he\r\nwas manifestly prosperous; his clothes were smartly cut in something of\r\nthe sporting manner, and the inside of his house was at least four times\r\ngrander than the outside.\r\n\r\nBut what mystified them most was this, that he did not so much exhibit\r\nthe natural curiosity of a gentleman whose private house is entered by\r\nstrangers, but rather an embarrassed and restless expectation. During\r\nDalroy’s eager apologies and courteous inquiries about the direction and\r\naccommodations of Peaceways, his eye (which was of the boiled gooseberry\r\norder) perpetually wandered from them to the cupboard and then again to\r\nthe window, and at last he got up and went to look out into the road.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, sir; very healthy place, Peaceways,” he said, peering through\r\nthe lattice. “Very ... dash it, what do they mean?... Very healthy\r\nplace. Of course they have their little ways.”\r\n\r\n“Only drink pure milk, don’t they?” asked Dalroy.\r\n\r\nThe householder looked at him with a rather wild eye and grunted.\r\n\r\n“Yes; so they say,” and he went again to the window.\r\n\r\n“I’ve bought some of it,” said Patrick, patting his pet milk-can, which\r\nhe carried under his arm, as if unable to be separated from Dr.\r\nMeadows’s discovery. “Have a glass of milk, sir.”\r\n\r\nThe man’s boiled eye began to bulge in anger—or some other emotion.\r\n\r\n“What do you want?” he muttered, “are you ’tecs or what?”\r\n\r\n“Agents and Distributors of the Meadows’ Mountain Milk,” said the\r\nCaptain, with simple pride, “taste it?”\r\n\r\nThe dazed householder took a glass of the blameless liquid and sipped\r\nit; and the change on his face was extraordinary.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m jiggered,” he said, with a broad and rather coarse grin.\r\n“That’s a queer dodge. You’re in the joke, I see.” Then he went again\r\nrestlessly to the window; and added, “but if we’re all friends, why the\r\nblazes don’t the others come in? I’ve never known trade so slow before.”\r\n\r\n“Who are the others?” asked Mr. Pump.\r\n\r\n“Oh, the usual Peaceways people,” said the other. “They generally come\r\nhere before work. Dr. Meadows don’t work them for very long hours, that\r\nwouldn’t be healthy or whatever he calls it; but he’s particular about\r\ntheir being punctual. I’ve seen ’em running, with all their pure-minded\r\ntogs on, when the hooter gave the last call.”\r\n\r\nThen he abruptly opened the front door and called out impatiently, but\r\nnot loudly:\r\n\r\n“Come along in if you’re coming. You’ll give the show away if you play\r\nthe fool out there.”\r\n\r\nPatrick looked out also and the view of the road outside was certainly\r\nrather singular. He was used to crowds, large and small, collecting\r\noutside houses which he had honoured with the sign of “The Old Ship,”\r\nbut they generally stared up at it in unaffected wonder and amusement.\r\nBut outside this open door, some twenty or thirty persons in what Pump\r\nhad called their night-gowns were moving to and fro like somnambulists,\r\napparently blind to the presence of the sign; looking at the other side\r\nof the road, looking at the horizon, looking at the clouds of morning;\r\nand only occasionally stopping to whisper to each other. But when the\r\nowner of the house called to one of these ostentatiously abstracted\r\nbeings and asked him hoarsely what the devil was the matter, it was\r\nnatural for the milk-fed one to turn his feeble eye toward the sign. The\r\ngooseberry eyes followed his, and the face to which they belonged was a\r\nstudy in apoplectic astonishment.\r\n\r\n“What the hell have you done to my house?” he demanded. “Of course they\r\ncan’t come in if this thing’s here.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll take it down, if you like,” said Dalroy, stepping out and picking\r\nit up like a flower from the front garden (to the amazement of the men\r\nin the road, who thought they had strayed into a nursery fairy-tale),\r\n“but I wish, in return, you’d give me some idea of what the blazes all\r\nthis means.”\r\n\r\n“Wait till I’ve served these men,” replied his host.\r\n\r\nThe goat-garbed persons went very sheepishly (or goatishly) into the now\r\nsignless building, and were rapidly served with raw spirits, which Mr.\r\nPump suspected to be of no very superior quality. When the last goat was\r\ngone, Captain Dalroy said:\r\n\r\n“I mean that all this seems to me topsy-turvy. I understood that as the\r\nlaw stands now, if there’s a sign they are allowed to drink and if there\r\nisn’t they aren’t.”\r\n\r\n“The Law!” said the man, in a voice thick with scorn. “Do you think\r\nthese poor brutes are afraid of the Law as they are of the Doctor?”\r\n\r\n“Why should they be afraid of the Doctor?” asked Dalroy, innocently. “I\r\nalways heard that Peaceways was a self-governing republic.”\r\n\r\n“Self-governing be damned,” was the illiberal reply. “Don’t he own all\r\nthe houses and could turn ’em out in a snow storm? Don’t ’e pay all the\r\nwages and could starve ’em stiff in a month? The Law!” And he snorted. A\r\nmoment after he squared his elbows on the table and began to explain\r\nmore fully.\r\n\r\n“I was a brewer about here and had the biggest brewery in these parts.\r\nThere were only two houses which didn’t belong to me, and the\r\nmagistrates took away their licenses after a time. Ten years ago you\r\ncould see Hugby’s Ales written beside every sign in the county. Then\r\ncame these cursed Radicals, and our leader, Lord Ivywood, must go over\r\nto their side about it, and let this Doctor buy all the land under some\r\nnew law that there shan’t be any pubs at all. And so my business is\r\nruined so that he can sell his milk. Luckily I’d done pretty well before\r\nand had some compensation, of course; and I still do a fair trade on the\r\nQ.T., as you see. But of course that don’t amount to half the old one,\r\nfor they’re afraid of old Meadows finding out. Snuffling old blighter!”\r\n\r\nAnd the gentleman with the good clothes spat on the carpet.\r\n\r\n“I am a Radical myself,” said the Irishman, rather coldly, “for all\r\ninformation on the Conservative party I must refer you to my friend, Mr.\r\nPump, who is, of course, in the inmost secrets of his leaders. But it\r\nseems to me a very rum sort of Radicalism to eat and drink at the orders\r\nof a master who is a madman, merely because he’s also a millionaire. O\r\nLiberty, what very complicated and even unsatisfactory social\r\ndevelopments are committed in thy name! Why don’t they kick the old ass\r\nround the town a bit? No boots? Is that why they’re allowed no boots?\r\nOh, roll him down hill in a milk can: he can’t object to that.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Pump, in his ruminant way, “Master Christian’s aunt\r\ndid, but ladies are more particular, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Look here!” cried Dalroy, in some excitement, “if I stick up that sign\r\noutside, and stay here to help, will you defy them? You’d be strictly\r\nwithin the law, and any private coercion I can promise you they shall\r\nrepent. Plant the sign and sell the stuff openly like a man, and you may\r\nstand in English history like a deliverer.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hugby, of Hugby’s Ales, only looked gloomily at the table. His was\r\nnot the sort of drinking nor the sort of drink-selling on which the\r\nrevolutionary sentiment flourishes.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the Captain, “will you come with me and say ‘Hear, hear!’\r\nand ‘How true!’—‘What matchless eloquence!’ if I make a speech in the\r\nmarketplace? Come along! There’s room in our car.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll come with you, if you like,” replied Mr. Hugby, heavily.\r\n“It’s true if yours is allowed we might get our trade back, too.” And\r\nputting on a silk hat he followed the Captain and the innkeeper out to\r\ntheir little car. The model village was not an appropriate background\r\nfor Mr. Hugby’s silk hat. Indeed, the hat somehow seemed to bring out by\r\ncontrast all that was fantastic in the place.\r\n\r\nIt was a superb morning, some hours after sunrise. The edges of the sky\r\ntouching the ring of dim woods and distant hills were still jewelled\r\nwith the tiny transparent clouds of daybreak, delicate red and green or\r\nyellow. But above the vault of Heaven rose through turquoise into a\r\ntorrid and solid blue in which the other clouds, the colossal cumuli,\r\ntumbled about like a celestial pillow-fight. The bulk of the houses were\r\nas white as the clouds, so that it looked (to use another simile) as if\r\nsome of the whitewashed cottages were flying and falling about the sky.\r\nBut most of the white houses were picked out here and there with bright\r\ncolours, here an ornament in orange or there a stripe of lemon yellow,\r\nas if by the brush of a baby giant. The houses had no thatching\r\n(thatching is not hygienic) but were mostly covered with a sort of\r\npeacock green tiles bought cheap at a Preraphaelite Bazaar; or, less\r\nfrequently, by some still more esoteric sort of terra cotta bricks. The\r\nhouses were not English, nor homelike, nor suited to the landscape; for\r\nthe houses had not been built by free men for themselves, but at the\r\nfancy of a whimsical lord. But considered as a sort of elfin city in a\r\npantomime it was a really picturesque background for pantomimic\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nI fear Mr. Dalroy’s proceedings from the first rather deserved that\r\nname. To begin with, he left the sign, the cask, and the keg all wrapped\r\nand concealed in the car, but removed all the wraps of his own disguise,\r\nand stood on the central patch of grass in that green uniform that\r\nlooked all the more insolent for being as ragged as the grass. Even that\r\nwas less ragged than his red hair, which no red jungle of the East could\r\nimitate. Then he took out, almost tenderly, the large milk-can, and\r\ndeposited it, almost reverently, on the island of turf. Then he stood\r\nbeside it, like Napoleon beside a gun, with an expression of tremendous\r\nseriousness and even severity. Then he drew his sword, and with that\r\nflashing weapon, as with a flail, lashed and thrashed the echoing metal\r\ncan till the din was deafening, and Mr. Hugby hastily got out of the car\r\nand withdrew to a slight distance, stopping his ears. Mr. Pump sat\r\nsolidly at the steering wheel, well knowing it might be necessary to\r\nstart in some haste.\r\n\r\n“Gather, gather, gather, Peaceways,” shouted Patrick, still banging on\r\nthe can and lamenting the difficulties of adapting “Macgregor’s\r\nGathering” to the name and occasion, “We’re landless, _landless_,\r\nlandless, Peaceways!”\r\n\r\nTwo or three of the goat-clad, recognising Mr. Hugby with a guilty look,\r\ndrew near with great caution, and the Captain shouted at them as if they\r\nwere an army covering Salisbury Plain.\r\n\r\n“Citizens,” he roared, saying anything that came into his head, “try the\r\nonly original unadulterated Mountain Milk, for which alone Mahomet came\r\nto the mountain. The original milk of the land flowing with milk and\r\nhoney; the high quality of which could alone have popularised so\r\nunappetising a combination. Try our milk! None others are genuine! Who\r\ncan do without milk. Even whales can’t do without milk. If any lady or\r\ngentleman keeps a favourite whale at home, now’s their chance! The early\r\nwhale catches the milk. Just look at our milk! If you say you can’t look\r\nat the milk, because it’s in the can—well, look at the can! You must\r\nlook at the can! You simply must! When Duty whispers low ‘Thou Must!’”\r\nhe bellowed at the top of his voice in a highly impromptu peroration,\r\n“When Duty whispers low ‘Thou Must,’ the Youth replies, ‘I can!’” And\r\nwith the word “Can” he hit the can with a shocking and shattering noise,\r\nlike a peal of demoniac bells of steel.\r\n\r\nThis introductory speech is open to criticism from those who regard it\r\nas intended for the study rather than the stage. The present chronicler\r\n(who has no aim save truth) is bound to record that for its own\r\nunscrupulous purpose it was extremely successful: a great mass of the\r\ncitizens of Peaceways having been attracted by the noise of one man\r\nshouting like a crowd. There are crowds who do not care to revolt; but\r\nthere are no crowds who do not like someone else to do it for them; a\r\nfact which the safest oligarchs may be wise to learn.\r\n\r\nBut Dalroy’s ultimate triumph (I regret to say) consisted in actually\r\nhanding to a few of the foremost of his audience some samples of his\r\nblameless beverage. The fact was certainly striking. Some were paralysed\r\nwith surprise. Some were abruptly broken double with laughter. Many\r\nchuckled. Some cheered. All looked radiantly toward the eccentric\r\norator.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the radiance died quietly and suddenly from their faces. And\r\nonly because one little old man had joined the group; a little old man\r\nin white linen with a white pointed beard and a white powder-puff of\r\nhair like thistledown: a man whom almost every man present could have\r\nkilled with the left arm.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n                     THE HOSPITALITY OF THE CAPTAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. MOSES MEADOWS, whether that was his name or an Anglicised version of\r\nit, had certainly come in the first instance from a little town in\r\nGermany and his first two books were written in German. His first two\r\nbooks were his best, for he began with a genuine enthusiasm for physical\r\nscience, and this was adulterated with nothing worse than a hatred of\r\nwhat he thought was superstition, and what many of us think is the soul\r\nof the state. The first enthusiasm was most notable in the first book,\r\nwhich was concerned to show that “in the female not upsprouting of the\r\nwhiskers was from the therewith increasing arrested mentality derived.”\r\nIn his second book he came more to grips with delusions, and for some\r\ntime he was held to have proved (to everyone who agreed with him\r\nalready) that the Time Ghost had been walking particularly “rapidly,\r\nlately; and that the Christus Mythus was by the alcoholic mind’s trouble\r\nexplained.” Then, unfortunately, he came across the institution called\r\nDeath, and began to argue with it. Not seeing any rational explanation\r\nof this custom of dying, so prevalent among his fellow-citizens, he\r\nconcluded that it was merely traditional (which he thought meant\r\n“effete”), and began to think of nothing but ways of evading or delaying\r\nit. This had a rather narrowing effect on him, and he lost much of that\r\nacrid ardour which had humanised the atheism of his youth, when he would\r\nalmost have committed suicide for the pleasure of taunting God with not\r\nbeing there. His later idealism grew more and more into materialism and\r\nconsisted of his changing hypotheses and discoveries about the\r\nhealthiest foods. There is no need to detain the reader over what has\r\nbeen called his Oil Period; his Sea-weed Period has been authoritatively\r\nexpounded in Professor Nym’s valuable little work; and on the events of\r\nhis Glue Period it is, perhaps, not very generous to dwell. It was\r\nduring his prolonged stay in England that he chanced on the instance of\r\nthe longevity of milk consumers, and built on it a theory which was, at\r\nthe beginning at least, sincere. Unfortunately it was also successful:\r\nwealth flowed in to the inventor and proprietor of Mountain Milk, and he\r\nbegan to feel a fourth and last enthusiasm, which, also, can come late\r\nin life and have a narrowing effect on the mind.\r\n\r\nIn the altercation which naturally followed on his discovery of the\r\nantics of Mr. Patrick Dalroy, he was very dignified, but naturally not\r\nvery tolerant; for he was quite unused to anything happening in spite of\r\nhim, or anything important even happening without him, in the land that\r\nlay around. At first he hinted severely that the Captain had stolen the\r\nmilk-can from the milk-producing premises, and sent several workmen to\r\ncount the cans in each shed; but Dalroy soon put him right about that.\r\n\r\n“I bought it in a shop at Wyddington,” he said, “and since then I have\r\nused no other. You’ll hardly believe me,” he said, with some truth, “but\r\nwhen I went into that shop I was quite a little man. I had one glass of\r\nyour Mountain Milk; and look at me now.”\r\n\r\n“You have no right to sell the milk here,” said Dr. Meadows, with the\r\nfaintest trace of a German accent. “You are not in my employment; I am\r\nnot responsible for your methods. You are not a representative of the\r\nbusiness.”\r\n\r\n“I’m an Advertisement,” said the Captain. “We advertise you all over\r\nEngland. You see that lean, skimpy, little man over there,” pointing to\r\nthe indignant Mr. Pump, “He’s Before Taking Meadows’s Mountain Milk. I’m\r\nAfter,” added Mr. Dalroy, with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“You shall laugh at the magistrate,” said the other, with a thickening\r\naccent.\r\n\r\n“I shall,” agreed Patrick. “Well, I’ll make a clean breast of it, sir.\r\nThe truth is it isn’t your milk at all. It has quite a different taste.\r\nThese gentlemen will tell you so.”\r\n\r\nA smothered giggle sent all the blood to the eminent capitalist’s face.\r\n\r\n“Then, either you have stolen my can and are a thief,” he said,\r\nstamping, “or you have introduced inferior substances into my discovery\r\nand are an adulterer—er—”\r\n\r\n“Try adulteratist,” said Dalroy, kindly. “Prince Albert always said\r\n‘adulteratarian.’ Dear old Albert! It seems like yesterday! But it is,\r\nof course, today. And it’s as true as daylight that this stuff tastes\r\ndifferent. I can’t tell you what the taste is” (subdued guffaws from the\r\noutskirts of the crowd). “It’s something between the taste of your first\r\nsugar-stick and the fag-end of your father’s cigar. It’s as innocent as\r\nHeaven and as hot as hell. It tastes like a paradox. It tastes like a\r\nprehistoric inconsistency—I trust I make myself clear. The men who taste\r\nit most are the simplest men that God has made, and it always reminds\r\nthem of the salt, because it is made out of sugar. Have some!”\r\n\r\nAnd with a gesture of staggering hospitality, he shot out his long arm\r\nwith the little glass at the end of it. The despotic curiosity in the\r\nPrussian overcame even his despotic dignity. He took a sip of the\r\nliquid, and his eyes stood out from his face.\r\n\r\n“You’ve been mixing something with the milk,” were the first words that\r\ncame to him.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Dalroy, “and so have you, unless you’re a swindler. Why\r\nis your milk advertised as different from everyone else’s milk, if you\r\nhaven’t made the difference? Why does a glass of your milk cost\r\nthreepence, and a glass of ordinary milk, a penny, if you haven’t put\r\ntwopennorth of something into it? Now, look here, Dr. Meadows. The\r\nPublic Analyst who would judge this, happens to be an honest man. I have\r\na list of the twenty-one and a half honest men still employed in such\r\nposts. I make you a fair offer. He shall decide what it is I add to the\r\nmilk, if you let him decide what it is you add to the milk. You must add\r\nsomething to the milk, or what can all these wheels and pumps and\r\npulleys be for? Will you tell me, here and now, what you add to the milk\r\nwhich makes it so exceedingly Mountain?”\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, full of the same sense of submerged mirth in\r\nthe mob. But the philanthropist had fallen into a naked frenzy in the\r\nsunlight, and shaking his fists aloft in a way unknown to all the\r\nEnglish around him, he cried out:\r\n\r\n“Ach! but I know what you add! I know what you add! It is the Alcohol!\r\nAnd you have no sign and you shall laugh at a magistrate.”\r\n\r\nDalroy, with a bow, retired to the car, removed a number of wrappings\r\nand produced the prodigious wooden sign-post of “The Old Ship,” with its\r\nblue three-decker and red St. George’s cross conspicuously displayed.\r\nThis he planted on his narrow territory of turf and looked round\r\nserenely.\r\n\r\n“In this old oak-panelled inn of mine,” he said, “I will laugh at a\r\nmillion magistrates. Not that there’s anything unhygienic about this\r\ninn. No low ceilings or stuffiness here. Windows open everywhere, except\r\nin the floor. And as I hear some are saying there ought always to be\r\nfood sold with fermented liquor, why, my dear Dr. Meadows, I’ve got a\r\ncheese here that will make another man of you. At least, we’ll hope so.\r\nWe can but try.”\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Meadows was long past being merely angry. The exhibition of the\r\nsign had put him into a serious difficulty. Like most sceptics, like\r\neven the most genuine sceptics such as Bradlaugh, he was as legal as he\r\nwas sceptical. He had a profound fear, which also had in it something\r\nbetter than fear, of being ultimately found in the wrong in a police\r\ncourt or a public inquiry. And he also suffered the tragedy of all such\r\nmen living in modern England; that he must always be certain to respect\r\nthe law, while never being certain of what it was. He could only\r\nremember generally that Lord Ivywood, when introducing or defending the\r\ngreat Ivywood Act on this matter, had dwelt very strongly on the unique\r\nand significant nature of the sign. And he could not be certain that if\r\nhe disregarded it altogether, he might not eventually be cast in heavy\r\ndamages—or even go to prison, in spite of his success in business. Of\r\ncourse he knew quite well that he had a thousand answers to such\r\nnonsense: that a patch of grass in the road couldn’t be an inn; that the\r\nsign wasn’t even produced when the Captain began to hand round the rum.\r\nBut he also knew quite well that in the black peril we call British law,\r\nthat is not the point. He had heard points quite as obvious urged to a\r\njudge and urged in vain. At the bottom of his mind he found this fact:\r\nrich as he was, Lord Ivywood had made him—and on which side would Lord\r\nIvywood be?\r\n\r\n“Captain,” said Humphrey Pump, speaking for the first time, “we’d better\r\nbe getting away. I feel it in my bones.”\r\n\r\n“Inhospitable innkeeper!” cried the Captain, indignantly. “And after I\r\nhave gone out of the way to license your premises! Why, this is the dawn\r\nof peace in the great city of Peaceways. I don’t despair of Dr. Meadows\r\ntossing off another bumper before we’ve done. For the moment, Brother\r\nHugby will engage.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he served out milk and rum at random; and still the Doctor\r\nhad too much terror of our legal technicalities to make a final\r\ninterference. But when Mr. Hugby, of Hugby’s Ales, heard his name\r\ncalled, he first of all jumped so as almost to dislodge the silk hat,\r\nthen he stood quite still. Then he accepted a glass of the new Mountain\r\nMilk; and then his very face became full of speech, before he had spoken\r\na word.\r\n\r\n“There’s a motor coming along the road from the far hills,” said\r\nHumphrey, quietly. “It’ll be across the last bridge down stream in ten\r\nminutes and come up on this side.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the Captain, impatiently, “I suppose you’ve seen a motor\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\n“Not in this valley all this morning,” answered Pump.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Chairman,” said Mr. Hugby, feeling a dim disposition to say “Mr.\r\nVice,” in memory of old commercial banquets, “I’m sure we’re all\r\nlaw-abiding people here, and wish to remain friends, especially with our\r\ngood friend the Doctor; may he never want a friend or a bottle—that is\r\nin short, anything he wants, as we go up the hill of prosperity, and so\r\non. But, as our friend here with the sign-board seems to be within his\r\nrights, well, I think the time’s come when we can look at these things\r\nmore broadly, so to speak. Now I know it’s quite true those dirty little\r\npubs do a lot of harm to a property, and you get a lot of ignorant\r\npeople there who are just like pigs; and I don’t say our friend the\r\nDoctor hasn’t done good by clearing ’em away. But a big, well-managed\r\nbusiness with plenty of capital behind it is quite another thing. Well,\r\nfriends, you all know that I was originally in the Trade; though I have,\r\nof course, left off selling under the new regulations.” Here the goats\r\nlooked rather guiltily at their cloven hoofs. “But I’ve got my little\r\nbit and I wouldn’t mind putting it into this ‘Old Ship’ here, if our\r\nfriend would allow it to be run on business lines. And especially if\r\nhe’d enlarge the premises a bit. Ha! ha! And if our good friend, the\r\nDoctor—”\r\n\r\n“You rascal fellow!” spluttered Meadows, “your goot friend the doctor\r\nwill make you dance before a magistrate.”\r\n\r\n“Now, don’t be unbusinesslike,” reasoned the brewer. “It won’t hurt your\r\nsales. It’s quite a different public, don’t you see? Do talk like a\r\nbusiness man.”\r\n\r\n“I am not a business man,” said the scientist, with fiery eyes, “I am a\r\nservant of humanity.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Dalroy, “why do you never do what your master tells you?”\r\n\r\n“The motor has crossed the river,” said Humphrey Pump.\r\n\r\n“You would undo all my works,” cried the Doctor, with sincere passion.\r\n“When I have built this town myself, when I have made it sober and\r\nhealthful myself, when I am awake and about before anyone in the town\r\nmyself, watching over its interests—you would ruin all to sell your\r\nbarbaric and fundamentally beastly beer. And then you call me a goot\r\nfriend. I am not a goot friend!”\r\n\r\n“That I can’t say,” growled Hugby, “but if it comes to that—aren’t you\r\ntrying to sell—”\r\n\r\nA motor car drove up with a white explosion of dust, and about six very\r\ndusty people got out of it. Even through the densest disguise of the\r\nswift motorist, Pump perceived in many of them the peculiar style and\r\nbodily carriage of the police. The most evident exception was a long and\r\nmore slender figure, which, on removing its cap and goggles, disclosed\r\nthe dark and drooping features of J. Leveson, Secretary. He walked\r\nacross to the little, old millionaire, who instantly recognized him and\r\nshook hands. They confabulated for some little time, turning over some\r\nofficial documents. Dr. Meadows cleared his throat and said to the whole\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\n“I am very glad to be able to announce to you all that this\r\nextraordinary outrage has been too late attempted. Lord Ivywood, with\r\nthe promptitude he so invariably shows, has immediately communicated to\r\nplaces of importance such as this a most just and right alteration of\r\nthe law, which exactly meets the present case.”\r\n\r\n“We shall sleep in jail tonight,” said Humphrey Pump. “I know it in my\r\nbones.”\r\n\r\n“It is enough to say,” proceeded the millionaire, “that by the law as it\r\nnow stands, any innkeeper, even if he display a sign, is subject to\r\nimprisonment if he sells alcohol on premises where it has not been\r\npreviously kept for three days.”\r\n\r\n“I thought it would be something like that,” muttered Pump. “Shall we\r\ngive up, Captain, or shall we try a bolt for it?”\r\n\r\nEven the impudence of Dalroy appeared for the instant dazed and stilled.\r\nHe was staring forlornly up into the abyss of sky above him, as if, like\r\nShelley, he could get inspiration from the last and purest clouds and\r\nthe perfect hues of the ends of Heaven.\r\n\r\nAt last he said, in a soft and meditative voice, the single syllable,\r\n\r\n“Sells!”\r\n\r\nPump looked at him sharply with a remarkable expression growing on his\r\ngrim face. But the Doctor was far too rabidly rejoicing in his triumph\r\nto understand the Captain’s meaning.\r\n\r\n“Sells alcohol, are the exact words,” he insisted, brandishing the blue\r\noblong of the new Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\n“So far as I am concerned they are inexact words,” said Captain Dalroy,\r\nwith polite indifference. “I have not been selling alcohol, I have been\r\ngiving it away. Has anybody here paid me money? Has anybody here seen\r\nanybody else pay me money? I’m a philanthropist just like Dr. Meadows.\r\nI’m his living image!”\r\n\r\nMr. Leveson and Dr. Meadows looked across at each other, and on the face\r\nof the first was consternation, and on the second a full return of all\r\nhis terrors of the complicated law.\r\n\r\n“I shall remain here for several weeks,” continued the Captain, leaning\r\nelegantly on the can, “and shall give away, gratis, such supplies of\r\nthis excellent drink as may be demanded by the citizens. It appears that\r\nthere is no such supply at present in this district, and I feel sure\r\nthat no person present can object to so strictly legal and highly\r\ncharitable an arrangement.”\r\n\r\nIn this he was apparently in error; for several persons present seemed\r\nto object to it. But curiously enough it was not the withered and\r\nfanatical face of the philanthropist Meadows, nor the dark and equine\r\nface of the official Leveson, which stood out most vividly as a picture\r\nof protest. The face most strangely unsympathetic with this form of\r\ncharity was that of the ex-proprietor of Hugby’s Ales. His gooseberry\r\neyes were almost dropping from his head and his words sprang from his\r\nlips before he could stop them.\r\n\r\n“And you blooming well think you can come here like a big buffoon, you\r\nbeast, and take away all my trade—”\r\n\r\nOld Meadows turned on him with the swiftness of an adder.\r\n\r\n“And what is your trade, Mr. Hugby?” he asked.\r\n\r\nThe brewer bubbled with a sort of bursting anger. The goats all looked\r\nat the ground as is, according to a Roman poet, the habit of the lower\r\nanimals. Man (in the character of Mr. Patrick Dalroy) taking advantage\r\nof a free but fine translation of the Latin passage, “looked aloft, and\r\nwith uplifted eyes beheld his own hereditary skies.”\r\n\r\n“Well, all I can say is,” roared Mr. Hugby, “if the police come all this\r\nway and can’t lock up a dirty loafer whose coat’s all in rags, there’s\r\nan end of me paying these fat infernal taxes and—”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Dalroy, in a voice that fell like an axe, “there is an end\r\nof you, please God. It’s brewers like you that have made the inns stink\r\nwith poison, till even good men asked for no inns at all. And you are\r\nworse than the teetotalers, for you prevented what they never knew. And\r\nas for you, eminent man of science, great philanthropist, idealist and\r\ndestroyer of inns, let me give one cold fact for your information. You\r\nare not respected. You are obeyed. Why should I or anyone respect you\r\nparticularly? You say you built this town and get up at daybreak to\r\nwatch this town. You built it for money and you watch it for more money.\r\nWhy should I respect you because you are fastidious about food, that\r\nyour poor old digestion may outlive the hearts of better men? Why should\r\nyou be the god of this valley, whose god is your belly, merely because\r\nyou do not even love your god, but only fear him? Go home to your\r\nprayers, old man; for all men shall die. Read the Bible, if you like, as\r\nthey do in your German home; and I suppose you once read it to pick\r\ntexts as you now read it to pick holes. I don’t read it myself, I’m\r\nafraid, but I remember some words in old Mulligan’s translation; and I\r\nleave them with you. ‘Unless God,’” and he made a movement with his arm,\r\nso natural and yet so vast that for an instant the town really looked\r\nlike a toy of bright coloured cardboard at the feet of the giant;\r\n“‘unless God build the city, their labour is but lost that build it;\r\nunless God keep the city, the watchman watcheth in vain. It is lost\r\nlabour that you rise up early in the morning and eat the bread of\r\ncarefulness; while He giveth His beloved sleep.’ Try and understand what\r\nthat means, and never mind whether it’s Elohistic. And now, Hump, we’ll\r\naway and away. I’m tired of the green tiles over there. Come, fill up my\r\ncup,” and he banged down the cask in the car, “come saddle my horses and\r\ncall out my men. And tremble, gay goats, in the midst of your glee; for\r\nyou’ve no’ seen the last of my milk-can and me.”\r\n\r\nThis song was joyously borne away with Mr. Dalroy in the disappearing\r\ncar; and the motorists were miles beyond pursuit from Peaceways before\r\nthey thought of halting again. But they were still beside the bank of\r\nthat noble and enlarging river; and in a place of deep fern and\r\nfairy-ribboned birches with the glowing and gleaming water behind them,\r\nPatrick asked his friend to stop the car.\r\n\r\n“By the way,” said Humphrey, suddenly, “there was one thing I didn’t\r\nunderstand. Why was he so afraid of the Public Analyst? What poison and\r\nchemicals does he put in the milk?”\r\n\r\n“H_{2}O,” answered the Captain, “I take it without milk myself.”\r\n\r\nAnd he bent over as if to drink of the stream, as he had done at\r\ndaybreak.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n                       THE TURK AND THE FUTURISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. ADRIAN CROOKE was a successful chemist whose shop was in the\r\nneighbourhood of Victoria, but his face expressed more than is generally\r\nrequired in a successful chemist. It was a curious face, prematurely old\r\nand like parchment, but acute and decisive, with real headwork in every\r\nline of it. Nor was his conversation, when he did converse, out of\r\nkeeping with this: he had lived in many countries, and had a rich store\r\nof anecdote about the more quaint and sometimes the more sinister side\r\nof his work, visions of the vapour of eastern drugs or guesses at the\r\ningredients of Renascence poisons. He himself, it need hardly be said,\r\nwas a most respectable and reliable apothecary, or he would not have had\r\nthe custom of families, especially among the upper classes; but he\r\nenjoyed as a hobby, the study of the dark days and lands where his\r\nscience had lain sometimes on the borders of magic and sometimes upon\r\nthe borders of murder. Hence it often happened that persons, who in\r\ntheir serious senses were well aware of his harmless and useful habits,\r\nwould leave his shop on some murky and foggy night, with their heads so\r\nfull of wild tales of the eating of hemp or the poisoning of roses, they\r\ncould hardly help fancying that the shop, with its glowing moon of\r\ncrimson or saffron, like bowls of blood and sulphur, was really a house\r\nof the Black Art.\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless for such conversational pleasures, in part, that Hibbs\r\nHowever entered the shop; as well as for a small glass of the same\r\nrestorative medicine which he had been taking when Leveson found him by\r\nthe open window. But this did not prevent Hibbs from expressing\r\nconsiderable surprise and some embarrassment when Leveson entered the\r\nsame chemist’s and asked for the same chemical. Indeed, Leveson looked\r\nharassed and weary enough to want it.\r\n\r\n“You’ve been out of town, haven’t you?” said Leveson. “No luck. They got\r\naway again on some quibble. The police wouldn’t make the arrest; and\r\neven old Meadows thought it might be illegal. I’m sick of it. Where are\r\nyou going?”\r\n\r\n“I thought,” said Mr. Hibbs, “of dropping in at this Post-Futurist\r\nexhibition. I believe Lord Ivywood will be there; he is showing it to\r\nthe Prophet. I don’t pretend to know much about art, but I hear it’s\r\nvery fine.”\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence and Mr. Leveson said, “People always prejudiced\r\nagainst new ideas.”\r\n\r\nThen there was another long silence and Mr. Hibbs said, “After all, they\r\nsaid the same of Whistler.”\r\n\r\nRefreshed by this ritual, Mr. Leveson became conscious of the existence\r\nof Crooke, and said to him, cheerfully, “That’s so in your department,\r\ntoo, isn’t it? I suppose the greatest pioneers in chemistry were\r\nunpopular in their own time.”\r\n\r\n“Look at the Borgias,” said Mr. Crooke. “They got themselves quite\r\ndisliked.”\r\n\r\n“You’re very flippant, you know,” said Leveson, in a fatigued way.\r\n“Well, so long. Are you coming, Hibbs?”\r\n\r\nAnd the two gentlemen, who were both attired in high hats and afternoon\r\ncallers’ coats, betook themselves down the street. It was a fine, sunny\r\nday, the twin of the day before that had shone so brightly on the white\r\ntown of Peaceways; and their walk was a pleasant one, along a handsome\r\nstreet with high houses and small trees that overlooked the river all\r\nthe way. For the pictures were exhibited in a small but famous gallery,\r\na rather rococo building of which the entrance steps almost descended\r\nupon the Thames. The building was girt on both sides and behind with\r\ngaudy flower-beds, and on the top of the steps, in front of the\r\nByzantine doorway, stood their old friend, Misysra Ammon, smiling\r\nbroadly, and in an unusually sumptuous costume. But even the sight of\r\nthat fragrant eastern flower did not seem to revive altogether the\r\nspirits of the drooping Secretary.\r\n\r\n“You have coome,” said the beaming Prophet, “to see the decoration? It\r\nis approo-ooved. I haf approo-ooved it.”\r\n\r\n“We came to see the Post-Futurist pictures,” began Hibbs; but Leveson\r\nwas silent.\r\n\r\n“There are no pictures,” said the Turk, simply, “if there had been I\r\ncould not haf approo-ooved. For those of our Religion pictures are not\r\ngoo-ood; they are Idols, my friendss. Loo-ook in there,” and he turned\r\nand darted a solemn forefinger just under his nose toward the gates of\r\nthe gallery; “Loo-ook in there and you will find no Idols. No Idols at\r\nall. I have most carefully loo-ooked into every one of the frames. Every\r\none I have approo-ooved. No trace of ze Man form. No trace of ze Animal\r\nform. All decoration as goo-ood as the goo-oodest of carpets; it harms\r\nnot. Lord Ivywood smile of happiness; for I tell him Islam indeed\r\nprogresses. Ze old Moslems allow to draw the picture of the vegetable.\r\nHere I hunt even for the vegetable. And there is no vegetable.”\r\n\r\nHibbs, whose trade was tact, naturally did not think it wise that the\r\neminent Misysra should go on lecturing from a tall flight of steps to\r\nthe whole street and river, so he had slipped past with a general\r\nproposal to go in and see. The Prophet and the Secretary followed; and\r\nall entered the outer hall where Lord Ivywood stood with the white face\r\nof a statue. He was the only statue the New Moslems were allowed to\r\nworship.\r\n\r\nOn a sofa like a purple island in the middle of the sea of floor sat\r\nEnid Wimpole, talking eagerly to her cousin, Dorian; doing, in fact, her\r\nbest to prevent the family quarrel, which threatened to follow hard on\r\nthe incident at Westminster. In the deeper perspective of the rooms Lady\r\nJoan Brett was floating about. And if her attitude before the\r\nPost-Futurist pictures could not be called humble, or even inquiring, it\r\nis but just to that school to say that she seemed to be quite as bored\r\nwith the floor that she walked on, and the parasol she held. Bit by bit\r\nother figures or groups of that world drifted through the Exhibition of\r\nthe Post-Futurists. It is a very small world, but it is just big enough\r\nand just small enough to govern a country—that is, a country with no\r\nreligion. And it has all the vanity of a mob; and all the reticence of a\r\nsecret society.\r\n\r\nLeveson instantly went up to Lord Ivywood, pulled papers from his pocket\r\nand was plainly telling him of the escape from Peaceways. Ivywood’s face\r\nhardly changed; he was, or felt, above some things; and one of them was\r\nblaming a servant before the servant’s social superiors. But no one\r\ncould say he looked less like cold marble than before.\r\n\r\n“I made all possible inquiries about their subsequent route,” the\r\nSecretary was heard saying, “and the most serious feature is that they\r\nseem to have taken the road for London.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” replied the statue, “they will be easier to capture here.”\r\n\r\nLady Enid, by a series of assurances (most of which were, I regret to\r\nsay, lies) had succeeded in preventing the scandal of her cousin,\r\nDorian, actually cutting her cousin, Phillip. But she knew very little\r\nof the masculine temper if she really thought she had prevented the\r\nprofound intellectual revolt of the poet against the politician. Ever\r\nsince he heard Mr. Hibbs say, “Yars! Yars!”, and order his arrest by a\r\ncommon policeman, the feelings of Dorian Wimpole had flowed for some\r\nfour days and nights in a direction highly contrary to the ideals of Mr.\r\nHibbs, and the sudden appearance of that blameless diplomatist quickened\r\nthe mental current to a cataract. But as he could not insult Hibbs, whom\r\nsocially he did not even know; and could not insult Ivywood, with whom\r\nhe had just had a formal reconciliation, it was absolutely necessary\r\nthat he should insult something else instead. All watchers for the Dawn\r\nwill be deeply distressed to know that the Post-Futurist School of\r\nPainting received the full effects of this perverted wrath. In vain did\r\nMr. Leveson affirm from time to time, “People always prejudiced against\r\nnew ideas.” Vainly did Mr. Hibbs say at the proper intervals, “After\r\nall, they said the same of Whistler.” Not by such decent formalities was\r\nthe frenzy of Dorian to be appeased.\r\n\r\n“That little Turk has more sense than you have,” he said, “he passes it\r\nas a good wall-paper. I should say it was a bad wall-paper; the sort of\r\nwall-paper that gives a sick man fever when he hasn’t got it. But to\r\ncall it pictures—you might as well call it seats for the Lord Mayor’s\r\nShow. A seat isn’t a seat if you can’t see the Lord Mayor’s Show. A\r\npicture isn’t a picture if you can’t see any picture. You can sit down\r\nat home more comfortably than you can at a procession. And you can walk\r\nabout at home more comfortably than you can at a picture gallery.\r\nThere’s only one thing to be said for a street show or a picture\r\nshow—and that is whether there is anything to be shown. Now, then! Show\r\nme something!”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Lord Ivywood, good humouredly, motioning toward the wall in\r\nfront of him, “let me show you the ‘Portrait of an Old Lady.’”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Dorian, stolidly, “which is it?”\r\n\r\nMr. Hibbs made a hasty gesture of identification, but was so unfortunate\r\nas to point to the picture of “Rain in the Apennines,” instead of the\r\n“Portrait of an Old Lady,” and his intervention increased the irritation\r\nof Dorian Wimpole. Most probably, as Mr. Hibbs afterward explained, it\r\nwas because a vivacious movement of the elbow of Mr. Wimpole interfered\r\nwith the exact pointing of the forefinger of Mr. Hibbs. In any case, Mr.\r\nHibbs was sharply and horridly fixed by embarrassment; so that he had to\r\ngo away to the refreshment bar and eat three lobster-patties, and even\r\ndrink a glass of that champagne that had once been his ruin. But on this\r\noccasion he stopped at one glass, and returned with a full diplomatic\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nHe returned to find that Dorian Wimpole had forgotten all the facts of\r\ntime, place, and personal pride, in an argument with Lord Ivywood,\r\nexactly as he had forgotten such facts in an argument with Patrick\r\nDalroy, in a dark wood with a donkey-cart. And Phillip Ivywood was\r\ninterested also; his cold eyes even shone; for though his pleasure was\r\nalmost purely intellectual, it was utterly sincere.\r\n\r\n“And I do trust the untried; I do follow the inexperienced,” he was\r\nsaying quietly, with his fine inflections of voice. “You say this is\r\nchanging the very nature of Art. I want to change the very nature of\r\nArt. Everything lives by turning into something else. Exaggeration is\r\ngrowth.”\r\n\r\n“But exaggeration of what?” demanded Dorian. “I cannot see a trace of\r\nexaggeration in these pictures; because I cannot find a hint of what it\r\nis they want to exaggerate. You can’t exaggerate the feathers of a cow\r\nor the legs of a whale. You can draw a cow with feathers or a whale with\r\nlegs for a joke—though I hardly think such jokes are in your line. But\r\ndon’t you see, my good Phillip, that even then the joke depends on its\r\nlooking like a cow and not only like a thing with feathers. Even then\r\nthe joke depends on the whale as well as the legs. You can combine up to\r\na certain point; you can distort up to a certain point; after that you\r\nlose the identity; and with that you lose everything. A Centaur is so\r\nmuch of a man with so much of a horse. The Centaur must not be hastily\r\nidentified with the Horsey Man. And the Mermaid must be maidenly; even\r\nif there is something fishy about her social conduct.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Lord Ivywood, in the same quiet way, “I understand what you\r\nmean, and I don’t agree. I should like the Centaur to turn into\r\nsomething else, that is neither man nor horse.”\r\n\r\n“But not something that has nothing of either?” asked the poet.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Ivywood, with the same queer, quiet gleam in his\r\ncolourless eyes, “something that has nothing of either.”\r\n\r\n“But what’s the good?” argued Dorian. “A thing that has changed entirely\r\nhas not changed at all. It has no bridge of crisis. It can remember no\r\nchange. If you wake up tomorrow and you simply _are_ Mrs. Dope, an old\r\nwoman who lets lodgings at Broadstairs—well, I don’t doubt Mrs. Dope is\r\na saner and happier person than you are. But in what way have _you_\r\nprogressed? What part of _you_ is better? Don’t you see this prime fact\r\nof identity is the limit set on all living things?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Phillip, with suppressed but sudden violence, “I deny that\r\nany limit is set upon living things.”\r\n\r\n“Why, then I understand,” said Dorian, “why, though you make such good\r\nspeeches, you have never written any poetry.”\r\n\r\nLady Joan, who was looking with tedium at a rich pattern of purple and\r\ngreen in which Misysra attempted to interest her (imploring her to\r\ndisregard the mere title, which idolatrously stated it as “First\r\nCommunion in the Snow”), abruptly turned her full face to Dorian. It was\r\na face to which few men could feel indifferent, especially when thus\r\nsuddenly shown them.\r\n\r\n“Why can’t he write poetry?” she asked. “Do you mean he would resent the\r\nlimits of metre and rhyme and so on?”\r\n\r\nThe poet reflected for a moment and then said, “Well, partly; but I mean\r\nmore than that too. As one can be candid in the family, I may say that\r\nwhat everyone says about him is that he has no humour. But that’s not my\r\ncomplaint at all. I think my complaint is that he has no pathos. That\r\nis, he does not feel human limitations. That is, he will not write\r\npoetry.”\r\n\r\nLord Ivywood was looking with his cold, unconscious profile into a\r\nlittle black and yellow picture called “Enthusiasm”; but Joan Brett\r\nleaned across to him with swarthy eagerness and cried quite\r\nprovocatively,\r\n\r\n“Dorian says you’ve no pathos. Have you any pathos? He says it’s a sense\r\nof human limitations.”\r\n\r\nIvywood did not remove his gaze from the picture of “Enthusiasm,” but\r\nsimply said “No; I have no sense of human limitations.” Then he put up\r\nhis elderly eyeglass to examine the picture better. Then he dropped it\r\nagain and confronted Joan with a face paler than usual.\r\n\r\n“Joan,” he said, “I would walk where no man has walked; and find\r\nsomething beyond tears and laughter. My road shall be my road indeed;\r\nfor I will make it, like the Romans. And my adventures shall not be in\r\nthe hedges and the gutters, but in the borders of the ever advancing\r\nbrain. I will think what was unthinkable until I thought it; I will love\r\nwhat never lived until I loved it—I will be as lonely as the First Man.”\r\n\r\n“They say,” she said, after a silence, “that the first man fell.”\r\n\r\n“You mean the priests?” he answered. “Yes, but even they admit that he\r\ndiscovered good and evil. So are these artists trying to discover some\r\ndistinction that is still dark to us.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Joan, looking at him with a real and unusual interest, “then\r\nyou don’t _see_ anything in the pictures, yourself?”\r\n\r\n“I see the breaking of the barriers,” he answered, “beyond that I see\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at the floor for a little time and traced patterns with her\r\nparasol, like one who has really received food for thought. Then she\r\nsaid, suddenly,\r\n\r\n“But perhaps the breaking of barriers might be the breaking of\r\neverything.”\r\n\r\nThe clear and colourless eyes looked at her quite steadily.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” said Lord Ivywood.\r\n\r\nDorian Wimpole made a sudden movement a few yards off, where he was\r\nlooking at a picture, and said, “Hullo! What’s this?” Mr. Hibbs was\r\nliterally gaping in the direction of the entrance.\r\n\r\nFramed in that fine Byzantine archway stood a great big, boney man in\r\nthreadbare but careful clothes, with a harsh, high-featured, intelligent\r\nface, to which a dark beard under the chin gave something of the\r\nPuritanic cast. Somehow his whole personality seemed to be pulled\r\ntogether and explained when he spoke with a North Country accent.\r\n\r\n“Weel, lards,” he said, genially, “t’hoose be main great on t’pictures.\r\nBut I coom for suthin’ in a moog. Haw! Haw!”\r\n\r\nLeveson and Hibbs looked at each other. Then Leveson rushed from the\r\nroom. Lord Ivywood did not move a finger; but Mr. Wimpole, with a sort\r\nof poetic curiosity, drew nearer to the stranger, and studied him.\r\n\r\n“It’s perfectly awful,” cried Enid Wimpole, in a loud whisper, “the man\r\nmust be drunk.”\r\n\r\n“Na, lass,” said the man with gallantry, “a’ve not been droonk, nobbut\r\nat Hurley Fair, these years and all; a’m a decent lad and workin’ ma way\r\nback t’Wharfdale. No harm in a moog of ale, lass.”\r\n\r\n“Are you quite sure,” asked Dorian Wimpole, with a singular sort of\r\ndelicate curiosity, “are you quite _sure_ you’re not drunk.”\r\n\r\n“A’m not droonk,” said the man, jovially.\r\n\r\n“Even if these were licensed premises,” began Dorian, in the same\r\ndiplomatic manner.\r\n\r\n“There’s t’sign on t’hoose,” said the stranger.\r\n\r\nThe black, bewildered look on the face of Joan Brett suddenly altered.\r\nShe took four steps toward the doorway, and then went back and sat on\r\nthe purple ottoman. But Dorian seemed fascinated with his inquiry into\r\nthe alleged decency of the lad who was working his way to Wharfdale.\r\n\r\n“Even if these were licensed premises,” he repeated, “drink could be\r\nrefused you if you were drunk. Now, are you _really_ sure you’re not\r\ndrunk. Would you know if it was raining, say?”\r\n\r\n“Aye,” said the man, with conviction.\r\n\r\n“Would you know any common object of your countryside,” inquired Dorian,\r\nscientifically, “a woman—let us say an old woman.”\r\n\r\n“Aye,” said the man, with good humour.\r\n\r\n“What on earth are you doing with the creature?” whispered Enid,\r\nfeverishly.\r\n\r\n“I am trying,” answered the poet, “to prevent a very sensible man from\r\nsmashing a very silly shop. I beg your pardon, sir. As I was saying,\r\nwould you know these things in a picture, now? Do you know what a\r\nlandscape is and what a portrait is? Forgive my asking; you see we are\r\nresponsible while we keep the place going.”\r\n\r\nThere soared up into the sky like a cloud of rooks the eager vanity of\r\nthe North.\r\n\r\n“We collier lads are none so badly educated, lad,” he said. “In the town\r\na’ was born in there was a gallery of pictures as fine as Lunnon. Aye,\r\nand a’ knew ’em, too.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Wimpole, pointing suddenly at the wall. “Would you be\r\nso kind, for instance, as to look at those two pictures. One represents\r\nan old woman and the other rain in the hills. It’s a mere formality. You\r\nshall have your drink when you’ve said which is which.”\r\n\r\nThe northerner bowed his huge body before the two frames and peered into\r\nthem patiently. The long stillness that followed seemed to be something\r\nof a strain on Joan, who rose in a restless manner, first went to look\r\nout of a window and then went out of the front door.\r\n\r\nAt length the art-critic lifted a large, puzzled but still philosophical\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“Soomehow or other,” he said, “a’ mun be droonk after all.”\r\n\r\n“You have testified,” cried Dorian with animation. “You have all but\r\nsaved civilization. And by God, you shall have your drink.”\r\n\r\nAnd he brought from the refreshment table a huge bumper of the Hibbsian\r\nchampagne, and declined payment by the rapid method of running out of\r\nthe gallery on to the steps outside.\r\n\r\nJoan was already standing there. Out the little side window she had seen\r\nthe incredible thing she expected to see; which explained the ludicrous\r\nscene inside. She saw the red and blue wooden flag of Mr. Pump standing\r\nup in the flower-beds in the sun, as serenely as if it were a tall and\r\ntropical flower; and yet, in the brief interval between the window and\r\nthe door it had vanished, as if to remind her it was a flying dream. But\r\ntwo men were in a little motor outside, which was in the very act of\r\nstarting. They were in motoring disguise, but she knew who they were.\r\nAll that was deep in her, all that was sceptical, all that was stoical,\r\nall that was noble, made her stand as still as one of the pillars of the\r\nporch; but a dog, bearing the name of Quoodle, sprang up in the moving\r\ncar, and barked with joy at the mere sight of her, and though she had\r\nborne all else, something in that bestial innocence of an animal\r\nsuddenly blinded her with tears.\r\n\r\nIt could not, however, blind her to the extraordinary fact that\r\nfollowed. Mr. Dorian Wimpole, attired in anything but motoring costume,\r\ndressed in that compromise between fashion and art which seems proper to\r\nthe visiting of picture-galleries, did not by any means stand as still\r\nas one of the pillars of the porch. He rushed down the steps, ran after\r\nthe car and actually sprang into it, without disarranging his\r\nWhistlerian silk hat.\r\n\r\n“Good afternoon,” he said to Dalroy, pleasantly. “You owe me a\r\nmotor-ride, you know.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n                         THE ROAD TO ROUNDABOUT\r\n\r\n\r\nPATRICK DALROY looked at the invader with a heavy and yet humourous\r\nexpression, and merely said, “I didn’t steal your car; really, I\r\ndidn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” answered Dorian, “I’ve heard all about it since, and as you’re\r\nrather the persecuted party, so to speak, it wouldn’t be fair not to\r\ntell you that I don’t agree much with Ivywood about all this. I disagree\r\nwith him; or rather, to speak medically, he disagrees with me. He has,\r\never since I woke up after an oyster supper and found myself in the\r\nHouse of Commons with policemen calling out, ‘Who goes home?’”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” inquired Dalroy, drawing his red bushy eyebrows together. “Do\r\nthe officials in Parliament say, ‘Who goes home?’”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Wimpole, indifferently, “it’s a part of some old custom\r\nin the days when Members of Parliament might be attacked in the street.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” inquired Patrick, in a rational tone, “why aren’t they attacked\r\nin the street?”\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. “It is a holy mystery,” said the Captain at last.\r\n“But, ‘Who goes home?’—that is uncommonly good.”\r\n\r\nThe Captain had received the poet into the car with all possible\r\nexpressions of affability and satisfaction, but the poet, who was\r\nkeen-sighted enough about people of his own sort, could not help\r\nthinking that the Captain was a little absent-minded. As they flew\r\nthundering through the mazes of South London (for Pump had crossed\r\nWestminster Bridge and was making for the Surrey hills), the big blue\r\neyes of the big red-haired man rolled perpetually up and down the\r\nstreets; and, after longer and longer silences, he found expression for\r\nhis thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Doesn’t it strike you that there are a very large number of chemists in\r\nLondon nowadays?”\r\n\r\n“Are there?” asked Wimpole, carelessly. “Well, there certainly are two\r\nvery close to each other just over there.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and both the same name,” replied Dalroy, “Crooke. And I saw the\r\nsame Mr. Crooke chemicalizing round the corner. He seems to be a highly\r\nomnipresent deity.”\r\n\r\n“A large business, I suppose,” observed Dorian Wimpole.\r\n\r\n“Too large for its profits, I should say,” said Dalroy. “What can people\r\nwant with two chemists of the same sort within a few yards of each\r\nother? Do they put one leg into one shop and one into the other and have\r\ntheir corns done in both at once? Or, do they take an acid in one shop\r\nand an alkali in the next, and wait for the fizz? Or, do they take the\r\npoison in the first shop and the emetic in the second shop? It seems\r\nlike carrying delicacy too far. It almost amounts to living a double\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“But, perhaps,” said Dorian, “he is an uproariously popular chemist,\r\nthis Mr. Crooke. Perhaps there’s a rush on some specialty of his.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” said the Captain, “that there are certain limitations\r\nto such popularity in the case of a chemist. If a man sells very good\r\ntobacco, people may smoke more and more of it from sheer\r\nself-indulgence. But I never heard of anybody exceeding in cod-liver\r\noil. Even castor-oil, I should say, is regarded with respect rather than\r\ntrue affection.”\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes of silence, he said, “Is it safe to stop here for an\r\ninstant, Pump?”\r\n\r\n“I think so,” replied Humphrey, “if you’ll promise me not to have any\r\nadventures in the shop.”\r\n\r\nThe motor car stopped before yet a fourth arsenal of Mr. Crooke and his\r\npharmacy, and Dalroy went in. Before Pump and his companion could\r\nexchange a word, the Captain came out again, with a curious expression\r\non his countenance, especially round the mouth.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Wimpole,” said Dalroy, “will you give us the pleasure of dining\r\nwith us this evening? Many would consider it an unceremonious invitation\r\nto an unconventional meal; and it may be necessary to eat it under a\r\nhedge or even up a tree; but you are a man of taste, and one does not\r\napologise for Hump’s rum or Hump’s cheese to persons of taste. We will\r\neat and drink of our best tonight. It is a banquet. I am not very\r\ncertain whether you and I are friends or enemies, but at least there\r\nshall be peace tonight.”\r\n\r\n“Friends, I hope,” said the poet, smiling, “but why peace especially\r\ntonight?”\r\n\r\n“Because there will be war tomorrow,” answered Patrick Dalroy,\r\n“whichever side of it you may be on. I have just made a singular\r\ndiscovery.”\r\n\r\nAnd he relapsed into his silence as they flew out of the fringe of\r\nLondon into the woods and hills beyond Croydon. Dalroy remained in the\r\nsame mood of brooding, Dorian was brushed by the butterfly wing of that\r\nfleeting slumber that will come on a man hurried, through the air, after\r\nlong lounging in hot drawing rooms; even the dog Quoodle was asleep at\r\nthe bottom of the car. As for Humphrey Pump, he very seldom talked when\r\nhe had anything else to do. Thus it happened that long landscapes and\r\nperspectives were shot past them like suddenly shifted slides, and long\r\nstretches of time elapsed before any of them spoke again. The sky was\r\nchanging from the pale golds and greens of evening to the burning blue\r\nof a strong summer night, a night of strong stars. The walls of woodland\r\nthat flew past them like long assegais, were mostly, at first, of the\r\nfenced and park-like sort; endless oblong blocks of black pinewood shut\r\nin by boxes of thin grey wood. But soon fences began to sink, and\r\npinewoods to straggle, and roads to split and even to sprawl. Half an\r\nhour later Dalroy had begun to realise something romantic and even\r\nfaintly reminiscent in the roll of the country, and Humphrey Pump had\r\nlong known he was on the marches of his native land.\r\n\r\nSo far as the difference could be defined by a detail, it seemed to\r\nconsist not so much in the road rising as in the road perpetually\r\nwinding. It was more like a path; and even where it was abrupt or\r\naimless, it seemed the more alive. They appeared to be ascending a big,\r\ndim hill that was built of a crowd of little hills with rounded tops; it\r\nwas like a cluster of domes. Among these domes the road climbed and\r\ncurled in multitudinous curves and angles. It was almost impossible to\r\nbelieve that it could turn itself and round on itself so often without\r\ntying itself in a knot and choking.\r\n\r\n“I say,” said Dalroy, breaking the silence suddenly, “this car will get\r\ngiddy and fall down.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” said Dorian, beaming at him, “my car, as you may have\r\nnoticed, was much steadier.”\r\n\r\nPatrick laughed, but not without a shade of confusion. “I hope you got\r\nback your car all right,” he said. “This is really nothing for speed;\r\nbut it’s an uncommonly good little climber, and it seems to have some\r\nclimbing to do just now. And even more wandering.”\r\n\r\n“The roads certainly seem to be very irregular,” said Dorian,\r\nreflectively.\r\n\r\n“Well,” cried Patrick, with a queer kind of impatience, “you’re English\r\nand I’m not. You ought to know why the road winds about like this. Why,\r\nthe Saints deliver us!” he cried, “it’s one of the wrongs of Ireland\r\nthat she can’t understand England. England won’t understand herself,\r\nEngland won’t tell us why these roads go wriggling about. Englishmen\r\nwon’t tell us! You won’t tell us!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be too sure,” said Dorian, with a quiet irony.\r\n\r\nDalroy, with an irony far from quiet, emitted a loud yell of victory.\r\n\r\n“Right,” he shouted. “More songs of the car club! We’re all poets here,\r\nI hope. Each shall write something about why the road jerks about so\r\nmuch. So much as this, for example,” he added, as the whole vehicle\r\nnearly rolled over in a ditch.\r\n\r\nFor, indeed, Pump appeared to be attacking such inclines as are more\r\nsuitable for a goat than a small motor-car. This may have been\r\nexaggerated in the emotions of his companions, who had both, for\r\ndifferent reasons, seen much of mere flat country lately. The sensation\r\nwas like a combination of trying to get into the middle of the maze at\r\nHampton Court, and climbing the spiral staircase to the Belfry at\r\nBruges.\r\n\r\n“This is the right way to Roundabout,” said Dalroy, cheerfully,\r\n“charming place; salubrious spot. You can’t miss it. First to the left\r\nand right and straight on round the corner and back again. That’ll do\r\nfor my poem. Get on, you slackers; why aren’t you writing your poems?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll try one if you like,” said Dorian, treating his flattered egotism\r\nlightly. “But it’s too dark to write; and getting darker.”\r\n\r\nIndeed they had come under a shadow between them and the stars, like the\r\nbrim of a giant’s hat; only through the holes and rents in which the\r\nsummer stars could now look down on them. The hill, like a cluster of\r\ndomes, though smooth and even bare in its lower contours was topped with\r\na tangle of spanning trees that sat above them like a bird brooding over\r\nits nest. The wood was larger and vaguer than the clump that is the\r\ncrown of the hill at Chanctonbury, but was rather like it and held much\r\nthe same high and romantic position. The next moment they were in the\r\nwood itself, and winding in and out among the trees by a ribbon of\r\npaths. The emerald twilight between the stems, combined with the\r\ndragon-like contortions of the great grey roots of the beeches, had a\r\nsuggestion of monsters and the deep sea; especially as a long litter of\r\ncrimson and copper-coloured fungi, which might well have been the more\r\ngorgeous types of anemone or jelly-fish, reddened the ground like a\r\nsunset dropped from the sky. And yet, contradictorily enough, they had\r\nalso a strong sense of being high up; and even near to heaven; and the\r\nbrilliant summer stars that stared through the chinks of the leafy roof\r\nmight almost have been white starry blossoms on the trees of the wood.\r\n\r\nBut though they had entered the wood as if it were a house, their\r\nstrongest sensation still was the rotatory; it seemed as if that high\r\ngreen house went round and round like a revolving lighthouse or the\r\nwhiz-gig temple in the old pantomimes. The stars seemed to circle over\r\ntheir heads; and Dorian felt almost certain he had seen the same\r\nbeech-tree twice.\r\n\r\nAt length they came to a central place where the hill rose in a sort of\r\ncone in the thick of its trees, lifting its trees with it. Here Pump\r\nstopped the car, and clambering up the slope, came to the crawling\r\ncolossal roots of a very large but very low beech-tree. It spread out to\r\nthe four quarters of heaven more in the manner of an octopus than a\r\ntree, and within its low crown of branches there was a kind of hollow,\r\nlike a cup, into which Mr. Humphrey Pump, of “The Old Ship,” Pebblewick,\r\nsuddenly and entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nWhen he appeared it was with a kind of rope ladder, which he politely\r\nhung over the side for his companions to ascend by, but the Captain\r\npreferred to swing himself onto one of the octopine branches with a\r\nwhirl of large wild legs worthy of a chimpanzee. When they were\r\nestablished there, each propped in the hollow against a branch, almost\r\nas comfortably as in an arm chair, Humphrey himself descended once more\r\nand began to take out their simple stores. The dog was still asleep in\r\nthe car.\r\n\r\n“An old haunt of yours, Hump, I suppose,” said the Captain. “You seem\r\nquite at home.”\r\n\r\n“I am at home,” answered Pump, with gravity, “at the sign of ‘The Old\r\nShip.’” And he stuck the old blue and red sign-board erect among the\r\ntoadstools, as if inviting the passer-by to climb the trees for a drink.\r\n\r\nThe tree just topped the mound or clump of trees, and from it they could\r\nsee the whole champaign of the country they had passed, with the silver\r\nroads roaming about in it like rivers. They were so exalted they could\r\nalmost fancy the stars would burn them.\r\n\r\n“Those roads remind me of the songs you’ve all promised,” said Dalroy at\r\nlast. “Let’s have some supper, Hump, and then recite.”\r\n\r\nHumphrey had hung one of the motor lanterns onto a branch above him, and\r\nproceeded by the light of it to tap the keg of rum and hand round the\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\n“What an extraordinary thing,” exclaimed Dorian Wimpole, suddenly. “Why,\r\nI’m quite comfortable! Such a thing has never happened before, I should\r\nimagine. And how holy this cheese tastes.”\r\n\r\n“It has gone on a pilgrimage,” answered Dalroy, “or rather a Crusade.\r\nIt’s a heroic, a fighting cheese. ‘Cheese of all Cheeses, Cheeses of all\r\nthe world,’ as my compatriot, Mr. Yeats, says to the Something-or-other\r\nof Battle. It’s almost impossible that this cheese can have come out of\r\nsuch a coward as a cow. I suppose,” he added, wistfully, “I suppose it\r\nwouldn’t do to explain that in this case Hump had milked the bull. That\r\nwould be classed by scientists among Irish legends—those that have the\r\nCeltic glamour and all that. No, I think this cheese must have come from\r\nthat Dun Cow of Dunsmore Heath, who had horns bigger than elephant’s\r\ntusks, and who was so ferocious that one of the greatest of the old\r\nheroes of chivalry was required to do battle with it. The rum’s good,\r\ntoo. I’ve earned this glass of rum—earned it by Christian humility. For\r\nnearly a month I’ve lowered myself to the beasts of the field, and gone\r\nabout on all fours like a teetotaler. Hump, circulate the bottle—I mean\r\nthe cask—and let us have some of this poetry you’re so keen about. Each\r\npoem must have the same title, you know; it’s a rattling good title.\r\nIt’s called “An Inquiry into the Causes geological, historical,\r\nagricultural, psychological, psychical, moral, spiritual and theological\r\nof the alleged cases of double, treble, quadruple and other curvature in\r\nthe English Road, conducted by a specially appointed secret commission\r\nin a hole in a tree, by admittedly judicious and academic authorities\r\nspecially appointed by themselves to report to the Dog Quoodle, having\r\npower to add to their number and also to take away the number they first\r\nthought of; God save the King.” Having delivered this formula with\r\nblinding rapidity, he added rather breathlessly, “that’s the note to\r\nstrike, the lyric note.”\r\n\r\nFor all his rather formless hilarity, Dalroy still impressed the poet as\r\nbeing more _distrait_ than the others, as if his mind were labouring\r\nwith some bigger thing in the background. He was in a sort of creative\r\ntrance; and Humphrey Pump, who knew him like his own soul, knew well\r\nthat it was not mere literary creation. Rather it was a kind of creation\r\nwhich many modern moralists would call destruction. For Patrick Dalroy\r\nwas, not a little to his misfortune, what is called a man of action; as\r\nCaptain Dawson realised when he found his entire person a bright\r\npea-green. Fond as he was of jokes and rhymes, nothing he could write or\r\neven sing ever satisfied him like something he could do.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that his contribution to the metrical inquiry into the\r\ncrooked roads was avowedly hasty and flippant. While Dorian who was of\r\nthe opposite temper, the temper that receives impressions instead of\r\npushing out to make them, found his artist’s love of beauty fulfilled as\r\nit had never been before in that noble nest; and was far more serious\r\nand human than usual. Patrick’s verses ran:\r\n\r\n              “Some say that Guy of Warwick,\r\n                 The man that killed the Cow,\r\n               And brake the mighty Boar alive,\r\n                 Beyond the Bridge at Slough,\r\n               Went up against a Loathly Worm\r\n                 That wasted all the Downs,\r\n               And so the roads they twist and squirm\r\n                 (If I may be allowed the term)\r\n               From the writhing of the stricken Worm\r\n                 That died in seven towns.\r\n                   I see no scientific proof\r\n                   That this idea is sound,\r\n                   And I should say they wound about\r\n                   To find the town of Roundabout,\r\n                   The merry town of Roundabout\r\n                   That makes the world go round.\r\n\r\n              “Some say that Robin Goodfellow,\r\n                 Whose lantern lights the meads,\r\n               (To steal a phrase Sir Walter Scott\r\n                 In heaven no longer needs)\r\n               Such dance around the trysting-place\r\n                 The moonstruck lover leads;\r\n               Which superstition I should scout;\r\n                 There is more faith in honest doubt,\r\n               (As Tennyson has pointed out)\r\n                 Than in those nasty creeds.\r\n                   But peace and righteousness (St. John)\r\n                   In Roundabout can kiss,\r\n                   And since that’s all that’s found about\r\n                   The pleasant town of Roundabout,\r\n                   The roads they simply bound about\r\n                   To find out where it is.\r\n\r\n              “Some say that when Sir Lancelot\r\n                 Went forth to find the Grail,\r\n               Grey Merlin wrinkled up the roads\r\n                 For hope that he should fail;\r\n               All roads led back to Lyonesse\r\n                 And Camelot in the Vale;\r\n               I cannot yield assent to this\r\n                 Extravagant hypothesis,\r\n               The plain, shrewd Briton will dismiss\r\n                 Such rumours (Daily Mail).\r\n                   But in the streets of Roundabout\r\n                   Are no such factions found,\r\n                   Or theories to expound about\r\n                   Or roll upon the ground about,\r\n                   In the happy town of Roundabout\r\n                   That makes the world go round.”\r\n\r\nPatrick Dalroy relieved his feelings by finishing with a shout, draining\r\na stiff glass of his sailor’s wine, turning restlessly on his elbow and\r\nlooking across the landscape toward London.\r\n\r\nDorian Wimpole had been drinking golden rum and strong starlight and the\r\nfragrance of forests; and, though his verses, too, were burlesque, he\r\nread them more emotionally than was his wont.\r\n\r\n “Before the Roman came to Rye or out to Severn strode,\r\n  The rolling English drunkard made the rolling English road.\r\n  A reeling road, a rolling road, that rambles round the shire,\r\n  And after him the parson ran, the sexton and the squire.\r\n  A merry road, a mazy road, and such as we did tread\r\n  That night we went to Birmingham by way of Beachy Head.\r\n\r\n “I knew no harm of Bonaparte and plenty of the Squire,\r\n  And for to fight the Frenchmen I did not much desire;\r\n  But I did bash their baggonets because they came arrayed\r\n  To straighten out the crooked road an English drunkard made,\r\n  Where you and I went down the lane with ale-mugs in our hands\r\n  The night we went to Glastonbury by way of Goodwin Sands.\r\n\r\n “His sins they were forgiven him; or why do flowers run\r\n  Behind him; and the hedges all strengthening in the sun?\r\n  The wild thing went from left to right and knew not which was which,\r\n  But the wild rose was above him when they found him in the ditch.\r\n  God pardon us, nor harden us; we did not see so clear\r\n  The night we went to Bannockburn by way of Brighton Pier.\r\n\r\n “My friends, we will not go again or ape an ancient rage,\r\n  Or stretch the folly of our youth to be the shame of age,\r\n  But walk with clearer eyes and ears this path that wandereth,\r\n  And see undrugged in evening light the decent inn of death;\r\n  For there is good news yet to hear and fine things to be seen\r\n  Before we go to Paradise by way of Kensal Green.”\r\n\r\n“Have you written one, Hump?” asked Dalroy. Humphrey, who had been\r\nscribbling hard under the lamp, looked up with a dismal face.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said. “But I write under a great disadvantage. You see, I know\r\nwhy the road curves about.” And he read very rapidly, all on one note:\r\n\r\n               “The road turned first toward the left\r\n                Where Pinker’s quarry made the cleft;\r\n                The path turned next toward the right\r\n                Because the mastiff used to bite;\r\n                Then left, because of Slippery Height,\r\n                And then again toward the right.\r\n                We could not take the left because\r\n                It would have been against the laws;\r\n                Squire closed it in King William’s day\r\n                Because it was a Right of Way.\r\n                Still right; to dodge the ridge of chalk\r\n                Where Parson’s Ghost it used to walk,\r\n                Till someone Parson used to know\r\n                Met him blind drunk in Callao.\r\n                Then left, a long way round, to skirt\r\n                The good land where old Doggy Burt\r\n                Was owner of the Crown and Cup,\r\n                And would not give his freehold up;\r\n                Right, missing the old river-bed,\r\n                They tried to make him take instead\r\n                Right, since they say Sir Gregory\r\n                Went mad and let the Gypsies be,\r\n                And so they have their camp secure.\r\n                And, though not honest, they are poor,\r\n                And that is something; then along\r\n                And first to right—no, I am wrong!\r\n                Second to right, of course; the first\r\n                Is what the holy sisters cursed,\r\n                And none defy their awful oaths\r\n                Since the policeman lost his clothes\r\n                Because of fairies; right again,\r\n                What used to be High Toby Lane,\r\n                Left by the double larch and right\r\n                Until the milestone is in sight,\r\n                Because the road is firm and good\r\n                From past the milestone to the wood;\r\n                And I was told by Dr. Lowe\r\n                Whom Mr. Wimpole’s aunt would know,\r\n                Who lives at Oxford writing books,\r\n                And ain’t so silly as he looks;\r\n                The Romans did that little bit\r\n                And we’ve done all the rest of it;\r\n                By which we hardly seem to score;\r\n                Left, and then forward as before\r\n                To where they nearly hanged Miss Browne,\r\n                Who told them not to cut her down,\r\n                But loose the rope or let her swing,\r\n                Because it was a waste of string;\r\n                Left once again by Hunker’s Cleft,\r\n                And right beyond the elm, and left,\r\n                By Pill’s right by Nineteen Nicks\r\n                And left——”\r\n\r\n“No! No! No! Hump! Hump! Hump!” cried Dalroy in a sort of terror. “Don’t\r\nbe exhaustive! Don’t be a scientist, Hump, and lay waste fairyland! How\r\nlong does it go on? Is there a lot more of it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Pump, in a stony manner. “There is a lot more of it.”\r\n\r\n“And it’s all true?” inquired Dorian Wimpole, with interest.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Pump with a smile, “it’s all true.”\r\n\r\n“My complaint, exactly,” said the Captain. “What you want is legends.\r\nWhat you want is lies, especially at this time of night, and on rum like\r\nthis, and on our first and our last holiday. What do you think about\r\nrum?” he asked Wimpole.\r\n\r\n“About this particular rum, in this particular tree, at this particular\r\nmoment,” answered Wimpole, “I think it is the nectar of the younger\r\ngods. If you ask me in a general, synthetic sense what I think of\r\nrum—well, I think it’s rather rum.”\r\n\r\n“You find it a trifle sweet, I suppose,” said Dalroy, with some\r\nbitterness. “Sybarite! By the way,” he said abruptly, “what a silly word\r\nthat word ‘Hedonist’ is! The really self-indulgent people generally like\r\nsour things and not sweet; bitter things like caviare and curries or\r\nwhat not. It’s the Saints who like the sweets. At least I’ve known at\r\nleast five women who were practically saints, and they all preferred\r\nsweet champagne. Look here, Wimpole! Shall I tell you the ancient oral\r\nlegend about the origin of rum? I told you what you wanted was legends.\r\nBe careful to preserve this one, and hand it on to your children; for,\r\nunfortunately, my parents carelessly neglected the duty of handing it on\r\nto me. After the words ‘A Farmer had three sons ...’ all that I owe to\r\ntradition ceases. But when the three boys last met in the village\r\nmarket-place, they were all sucking sugar-sticks. Nevertheless, they\r\nwere all discontented, and on that day parted for ever. One remained on\r\nhis father’s farm, hungering for his inheritance. One went up to London\r\nto seek his fortune, as fortunes are found today in that town forgotten\r\nof God. The third ran away to sea. And the first two flung away their\r\nsugar-sticks in shame; and he on the farm was always drinking smaller\r\nand sourer beer for the love of money; and he that was in town was\r\nalways drinking richer and richer wines, that men might see that he was\r\nrich. But he who ran away to sea actually ran on board with the\r\nsugar-stick in his mouth; and St. Peter or St. Andrew, or whoever is the\r\npatron of men in boats, touched it and turned it into a fountain for the\r\ncomfort of men upon the sea. That is the sailor’s theory of the origin\r\nof rum. Inquiry addressed to any busy Captain with a new crew in the act\r\nof shipping an unprecedented cargo, will elicit a sympathetic\r\nagreement.”\r\n\r\n“Your rum at least,” said Dorian, good-humouredly, “may well produce a\r\nfairy-tale. But, indeed, I think all this would have been a fairy-tale\r\nwithout it.”\r\n\r\nPatrick raised himself from his arboreal throne, and leaned against his\r\nbranch with a curious and sincere sense of being rebuked.\r\n\r\n“Yours was a good poem,” he said, with seeming irrelevance, “and mine\r\nwas a bad one. Mine was bad, partly because I’m not a poet as you are;\r\nbut almost as much because I was trying to make up another song at the\r\nsame time. And it went to another tune, you see.”\r\n\r\nHe looked out over the rolling roads and said almost to himself:\r\n\r\n         “In the city set upon slime and loam\r\n          They cry in their parliament ‘Who goes home?’\r\n          And there is no answer in arch or dome,\r\n          For none in the city of graves goes home.\r\n          Yet these shall perish and understand,\r\n          For God has pity on this great land.\r\n          Men that are men again; who goes home?\r\n          Tocsin and trumpeter! Who goes home?\r\n          For there’s blood on the field and blood on the foam,\r\n          And blood on the body when man goes home.\r\n          And a voice valedictory—Who is for Victory?\r\n          Who is for Liberty? Who goes home?”\r\n\r\nSoftly and idly as he had said this second rhyme, there were\r\ncircumstances about his attitude that must have troubled or interested\r\nanyone who did not know him well.\r\n\r\n“May I ask,” asked Dorian, laughing, “why it is necessary to draw your\r\nsword at this stage of the affair?”\r\n\r\n“Because we have left the place called Roundabout,” answered Patrick,\r\n“and we have come to a place called Rightabout.”\r\n\r\nAnd he lifted his sword toward London, and the grey glint upon it came\r\nfrom a low, grey light in the east.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n                      THE CHEMISTRY OF MR. CROOKE\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN the celebrated Hibbs next visited the shop of Crooke, that mystic\r\nand criminologist chemist, he found the premises were impressively and\r\neven amazingly enlarged with decorations in the eastern style. Indeed,\r\nit would not have been too much to say that Mr. Crooke’s shop occupied\r\nthe whole of one side of a showy street in the West End; the other side\r\nbeing a blank façade of public buildings. It would be no exaggeration to\r\nsay that Mr. Crooke was the only shopkeeper for some distance round. Mr.\r\nCrooke still served in his shop, however; and politely hastened to serve\r\nhis customer with the medicine that was customary. Unfortunately, for\r\nsome reason or other, history was, in connection with this shop, only\r\ntoo prone to repeat itself. And after a vague but soothing conversation\r\nwith the chemist (on the subject of vitriol and its effects on human\r\nhappiness), Mr. Hibbs experienced the acute annoyance of once more\r\nbeholding his most intimate friend, Mr. Joseph Leveson, enter the same\r\nfashionable emporium. But, indeed, Leveson’s own annoyance was much too\r\nacute for him to notice any on the part of Hibbs.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, stopping dead in the middle of the shop, “here is a\r\nfine confounded kettle of fish!”\r\n\r\nIt is one of the tragedies of the diplomatic that they are not allowed\r\nto admit either knowledge or ignorance; so Hibbs looked gloomily wise;\r\nand said, pursing his lips, “you mean the _general_ situation.”\r\n\r\n“I mean the situation about this everlasting business of the inn-signs,”\r\nsaid Leveson, impatiently. “Lord Ivywood went up specially, when his leg\r\nwas really bad, to get it settled in the House in a small\r\nnon-contentious bill, providing that the sign shouldn’t be enough if the\r\nliquor hadn’t been on the spot three days.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but,” said Hibbs, sinking his voice to a soft solemnity, as being\r\none of the initiate, “a thing like _that_ can be managed, don’t you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“Of course it can,” said the other, still with the same slightly\r\nirritable air. “It was. But it doesn’t seem to occur to you, any more\r\nthan it did to his lordship, that there is rather a weak point after all\r\nin this business of passing acts quietly because they’re un-popular. Has\r\nit ever occurred to you that if a law is really kept too quiet to be\r\nopposed, it may also be kept too quiet to be obeyed. It’s not so easy to\r\nhush it up from a big politician without running the risk of hushing it\r\nup even from a common policeman.”\r\n\r\n“But surely that can’t happen, by the nature of things?”\r\n\r\n“Can’t it, by God,” said J. Leveson, appealing to a less pantheistic\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nHe unfolded a number of papers from his pocket, chiefly cheap local\r\nnewspapers, but some of them letters and telegrams.\r\n\r\n“Listen to this!” he said. “A curious incident occurred in the village\r\nof Poltwell in Surrey yesterday morning. The baker’s shop of Mr.\r\nWhiteman was suddenly besieged by a knot of the looser types of the\r\nlocality, who appear to have demanded beer instead of bread; basing\r\ntheir claim on some ornamental object erected outside the shop; which\r\nobject they asserted to be a sign-board within the meaning of the act.\r\nThere, you see, they haven’t even heard of the new act! What do you\r\nthink of this, from the _Clapton Conservator_. ‘The contempt of\r\nSocialists for the law was well illustrated yesterday, when a crowd,\r\ncollected round some wooden ensign of Socialism set up before Mr.\r\nDugdale’s Drapery Stores, refused to disperse, though told that their\r\naction was contrary to the law. Eventually the malcontents joined the\r\nprocession following the wooden emblem.’ And what do you say to this?\r\n‘Stop-press news. A chemist in Pimlico has been invaded by a huge crowd,\r\ndemanding beer; and asserting the provision of it to be among his\r\nduties. The chemist is, of course, well acquainted with his immunities\r\nin the matter, especially under the new act; but the old notion of the\r\nimportance of the sign seems still to possess the populace and even, to\r\na certain extent, to paralyze the police.’ What do you say to that?\r\nIsn’t it as plain as Monday morning that this Flying Inn has flown a day\r\nin front of us, as all such lies do?” There was a diplomatic silence.\r\n\r\n“Well,” asked the still angry Leveson of the still dubious Hibbs, “what\r\ndo you make of all that?”\r\n\r\nOne ill-acquainted with that relativity essential to all modern minds,\r\nmight possibly have fancied that Mr. Hibbs could not make much of it.\r\nHowever that may be, his explanations or incapacity for explanations,\r\nwere soon tested with a fairly positive test. For Lord Ivywood actually\r\nwalked into the shop of Mr. Crooke.\r\n\r\n“Good day, gentlemen,” he said, looking at them with an expression which\r\nthey both thought baffling and even a little disconcerting. “Good\r\nmorning, Mr. Crooke. I have a celebrated visitor for you.” And he\r\nintroduced the smiling Misysra. The Prophet had fallen back on a\r\ncomparatively quiet costume this morning, a mere matter of purple and\r\norange or what not; but his aged face was now perennially festive.\r\n\r\n“The Cause progresses,” he said. “Everywhere the Cause progresses. You\r\nheard his lordship’s beau-uti-ful speech?”\r\n\r\n“I have heard many,” said Hibbs, gracefully, “that can be so described.”\r\n\r\n“The Prophet means what I was saying about the Ballot Paper Amendment\r\nAct,” said Ivywood, casually. “It seems to be the alphabet of\r\nstatesmanship to recognise now that the great oriental British Empire\r\nhas become one corporate whole with the occidental one. Look at our\r\nuniversities, with their Mohammedan students; soon they may be a\r\nmajority. Now are we,” he went on, still more quietly, “are we to rule\r\nthis country under the forms of representative government? I do not\r\npretend to believe in democracy, as you know, but I think it would be\r\nextremely unsettling and incalculable to destroy representative\r\ngovernment. If we are to give Moslem Britain representative government,\r\nwe must not make the mistake we made about the Hindoos and military\r\norganization—which led to the Mutiny. We must not ask them to make a\r\ncross on their ballot papers; for though it seems a small thing, it may\r\noffend them. So I brought in a little bill to make it optional between\r\nthe old-fashioned cross and an upward curved mark that might stand for a\r\ncrescent—and as it’s rather easier to make, I believe it will be\r\ngenerally adopted.”\r\n\r\n“And so,” said the radiant old Turk, “the little, light, easily made,\r\ncurly mark is substituted for the hard, difficult, double-made, cutting\r\nboth ways mark. It is the more good for hygi-e-ene. For you must know,\r\nand indeed our good and wise Chemist will tell you, that the Saracenic\r\nand the Arabian and the Turkish physicians were the first of all\r\nphysicians; and taught all medicals to the barbarians of the Frankish\r\nterritories. And many of the moost modern, the moost fashionable\r\nremedies, are thus of the oriental origin.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is quite true,” said Crooke, in his rather cryptic and\r\nunsympathetic way, “the powder called Arenine, lately popularised by Mr.\r\nBoze, now Lord Helvellyn, who tried it first on birds, is made of plain\r\ndesert sand. And what you see in prescriptions as _Cannabis Indiensis_\r\nis what our lively neighbours of Asia describe more energetically as\r\nbhang.”\r\n\r\n“And so-o—in the sa-ame way,” said Misysra, making soothing passes with\r\nhis brown hand like a mesmerist, “in the sa-ame way the making of the\r\ncrescent is hy-gienic; the making of the cross is non-hygienic. The\r\ncrescent was a little wave, as a leaf, as a little curling feather,” and\r\nhe waved his hand with real artistic enthusiasm toward the capering\r\ncurves of the new Turkish decoration which Ivywood had made fashionable\r\nin many of the fashionable shops. “But when you make the cross you must\r\nmake the one line _so-o_,” and he swept the horizon with the brown hand,\r\n“and then you must go back and make the other line so-o,” and he made an\r\nupward gesture suggestive of one constrained to lift a pine-tree. “And\r\nthen you become very ill.”\r\n\r\n“As a matter of fact, Mr. Crooke,” said Ivywood, in his polite manner,\r\n“I brought the Prophet here to consult you as the best authority on the\r\nvery point you have just mentioned—the use of hashish or the hemp-plant.\r\nI have it on my conscience to decide whether these oriental stimulants\r\nor sedatives shall come under the general veto we are attempting to\r\nimpose on the vulgar intoxicants. Of course one has heard of the\r\nhorrible and voluptuous visions, and a kind of insanity attributed to\r\nthe Assassins and the Old Man of the Mountain. But, on the one hand, we\r\nmust clearly discount much for the illimitable pro-Christian bias with\r\nwhich the history of these eastern tribes is told in this country. Would\r\nyou say the effect of hashish was extremely bad?” And he turned first to\r\nthe Prophet.\r\n\r\n“You will see mosques,” said that seer with candour, “many mosques—more\r\nmosques—taller and taller mosques till they reach the moon and you hear\r\na dreadful voice in the very high mosque calling the muezzin; and you\r\nwill think it is Allah. Then you will see wives—many, many wives—more\r\nwives than you yet have. Then you will be rolled over and over in a\r\ngreat pink and purple sea—which is still wives. Then you will go to\r\nsleep. I have only done it once,” he concluded mildly.\r\n\r\n“And what do you think about hashish, Mr. Crooke?” asked Ivywood,\r\nthoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“I think it’s hemp at both ends,” said the Chemist.\r\n\r\n“I fear,” said Lord Ivywood, “I don’t quite understand you.”\r\n\r\n“A hempen drink, a murder, and a hempen rope. That’s my experience in\r\nIndia,” said Mr. Crooke.\r\n\r\n“It is true,” said Ivywood, yet more reflectively, “that the thing is\r\nnot Moslem in any sense in its origin. There is that against the\r\nAssassins always. And, of course,” he added, with a simplicity that had\r\nsomething noble about it, “their connection with St. Louis discredits\r\nthem rather.”\r\n\r\nAfter a space of silence, he said suddenly, looking at Crooke, “So it\r\nisn’t the sort of thing you chiefly sell?”\r\n\r\n“No, my lord, it isn’t what I chiefly sell,” said the Chemist. He also\r\nlooked steadily, and the wrinkles of his young-old face were like\r\nhieroglyphics.\r\n\r\n“The Cause progress! Everywhere it progress!” cried Misysra, spreading\r\nhis arms and relieving a momentary tension of which he was totally\r\nunaware. “The hygienic curve of the crescent will soon superimpose\r\nhimself for your plus sign. You already use him for the short syllables\r\nin your dactyl; which is doubtless of oriental origin. You see the new\r\ngame?”\r\n\r\nHe said this so suddenly that everyone turned round, to see him produce\r\nfrom his purple clothing a brightly coloured and highly polished\r\napparatus from one of the grand toy-shops; which, on examination, seemed\r\nto consist of a kind of blue slate in a red and yellow frame; a number\r\nof divisions being already marked on the slate, about seventeen slate\r\npencils with covers of different colours, and a vast number of printed\r\ninstructions, stating that it was but recently introduced from the\r\nremote East, and was called Naughts and Crescents.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, Lord Ivywood, with all his enthusiasm, seemed almost\r\nannoyed at the emergence of this Asiatic discovery; more especially as\r\nhe really wanted to look at Mr. Crooke, as hard as Mr. Crooke was\r\nlooking at him.\r\n\r\nHibbs coughed considerately and said, “Of course all our things came\r\nfrom the East, and”—and he paused, being suddenly unable to remember\r\nanything but curry; to which he was very rightly attached. He then\r\nremembered Christianity, and mentioned that too. “Everything from the\r\nEast is good, of course,” he ended, with an air of light omniscience.\r\n\r\nThose who in later ages and other fashions failed to understand how\r\nMisysra had ever got a mental hold on men like Lord Ivywood, left out\r\ntwo elements in the man, which are very attractive, especially to other\r\nmen. One was that there was _no_ subject on which the little Turk could\r\nnot instantly produce a theory. The other was that though the theories\r\nwere crowded, they were consistent. He was never known to accept an\r\nillogical compliment.\r\n\r\n“You are in error,” he said, solemnly, to Hibbs, “because you say all\r\nthings from the East are good. There is the east wind. I do not like\r\nhim. He is not good. And I think very much that all the warmth and all\r\nthe wealthiness and the colours and the poems and the religiousness that\r\nthe East was meant to give you have been much poisoned by this accident,\r\nthis east wind. When you see the green flag of the Prophet, you do not\r\nthink of a green field in Summer, you think of a green wave in your seas\r\nof Winter; for you think it blown by the east wind. When you read of the\r\nmoon-faced houris you think not of our moons like oranges but of your\r\nmoons like snowballs—”\r\n\r\nHere a new voice contributed to the conversation. Its contribution,\r\nthough imperfectly understood, appeared to be “Nar! Why sh’d I wite for\r\na little Jew in ’is dressin’ gown? Little Jews in their dressin’ gowns\r\n’as their drinks, and we ’as our drinks. Bitter, miss.”\r\n\r\nThe speaker, who appeared to be a powerful person of the plastering\r\noccupation, looked round for the unmarried female he had ceremonially\r\naddressed; and seemed honestly abashed that she was not present.\r\n\r\nIvywood looked at the man with that expression of one turned to stone,\r\nwhich his physique made so effective in him. But J. Leveson, Secretary,\r\ncould summon no such powers of self-petrification. Upon his soul the\r\nslaughter red of that unhallowed eve arose when first the Ship and he\r\nwere foes; when he discovered that the poor are human beings, and\r\ntherefore are polite and brutal within a comparatively short space of\r\ntime. He saw that two other men were standing behind the plastering\r\nperson, one of them apparently urging him to counsels of moderation;\r\nwhich was an ominous sign. And then he lifted his eyes and saw something\r\nworse than any omen.\r\n\r\nAll the glass frontage of the shop was a cloud of crowding faces. They\r\ncould not be clearly seen, since night was closing in on the street; and\r\nthe dazzling fires of ruby and amethyst which the lighted shop gave to\r\nits great globes of liquid, rather veiled than revealed them. But the\r\nforemost actually flattened and whitened their noses on the glass, and\r\nthe most distant were nearer than Mr. Leveson wanted them. Also he saw a\r\nshape erect outside the shop; the shape of an upright staff and a square\r\nboard. He could not see what was on the board. He did not need to see.\r\n\r\nThose who saw Lord Ivywood at such moments understood why he stood out\r\nso strongly in the history of his time, in spite of his frozen face and\r\nhis fanciful dogmas. He had all the negative nobility that is possible\r\nto man. Unlike Nelson and most of the great heroes, he knew not fear.\r\nThus he was never conquered by a surprise, but was cold and collected\r\nwhen other men had lost their heads even if they had not lost their\r\nnerve.\r\n\r\n“I will not conceal from you, gentlemen,” said Lord Ivywood, “that I\r\nhave been expecting this. I will not even conceal from you that I have\r\nbeen occupying Mr. Crooke’s time until it occurred. So far from\r\nexcluding the crowd, I suggest it would be an excellent thing if Mr.\r\nCrooke could accommodate them all in this shop. I want to tell, as soon\r\nas possible, as large a crowd as possible that the law is altered and\r\nthis folly about the Flying Inn has ceased. Come in, all of you! Come in\r\nand listen!”\r\n\r\n“Thank yer,” said a man connected in some way with motor buses, who\r\nlurched in behind the plasterer.\r\n\r\n“Thanky, sir,” said a bright little clock-mender from Croydon, who\r\nimmediately followed him.\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” said a rather bewildered clerk from Camberwell, who came next\r\nin the rather bewildered procession.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Mr. Dorian Wimpole, who entered, carrying a large\r\nround cheese.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Captain Dalroy, who entered carrying a large cask of\r\nrum.\r\n\r\n“Thank you very much,” said Mr. Humphrey Pump, who entered the shop\r\ncarrying the sign of “The Old Ship.”\r\n\r\nI fear it must be recorded that the crowd which followed them dispensed\r\nwith all expressions of gratitude. But though the crowd filled the shop\r\nso that there was no standing room to spare, Leveson still lifted his\r\ngloomy eyes and beheld his gloomy omen. For, though there were very many\r\nmore people standing in the shop, there seemed to be no less people\r\nlooking in at the window.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Ivywood, “all jokes come to an end. This one has gone\r\nso far as to be serious; and it might have become impossible to correct\r\npublic opinion, and expound to law-abiding citizens the true state of\r\nthe law, had I not been able to meet so representative an assembly in so\r\ncentral a place. It is not pertinent to my purpose to indicate what I\r\nthink of the jest which Captain Dalroy and his friends have been playing\r\nupon you for the last few weeks. But I think Captain Dalroy will himself\r\nconcede that I am not jesting.”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart,” said Dalroy, in a manner that was unusually serious\r\nand even sad. Then he added with a sigh, “And as you truly say, my jest\r\nhas come to an end.”\r\n\r\n“That wooden sign,” said Ivywood, pointing at the queer blue ship, “can\r\nbe cut up for firewood. It shall lead decent citizens a devil’s dance no\r\nmore. Understand it once and for all, before you learn it from policemen\r\nor prison warders. You are under a new law. That sign is the sign of\r\nnothing. You can no more buy and sell alcohol by having that outside\r\nyour house, than if it were a lamp-post.”\r\n\r\n“D’you meanter say, guv’ner,” said the plasterer, with a dawn of\r\nintelligence on his large face which was almost awful to watch, “that I\r\nain’t to ’ave a glass o’ bitter?”\r\n\r\n“Try a glass of rum,” said Patrick.\r\n\r\n“Captain Dalroy,” said Lord Ivywood, “if you give one drop from that\r\ncask to that man, you are breaking the law and you shall sleep in jail.”\r\n\r\n“Are you quite sure?” asked Dalroy, with a strange sort of anxiety. “I\r\nmight escape.”\r\n\r\n“I am quite sure,” said Ivywood. “I have posted the police with full\r\npowers for the purpose, as you will find. I mean that this business\r\nshall end here tonight.”\r\n\r\n“If I find that pleeceman what told me I could ’ave a drink just now,\r\nI’ll knock ’is ’elmet into a fancy necktie, I will,” said the plasterer.\r\n“Why ain’t people allowed to know the law?”\r\n\r\n“They ain’t got no right to alter the law in the dark like that,” said\r\nthe clock-mender. “Damn the new law.”\r\n\r\n“What is the new law?” asked the clerk.\r\n\r\n“The words inserted by the recent Act,” said Lord Ivywood, with the cold\r\ncourtesy of the Conqueror, “are to the effect that alcohol cannot be\r\nsold, even under a lawful sign, unless alcoholic liquors have been kept\r\nfor three days on the premises. Captain Dalroy, that cask of yours has\r\nnot, I think, been three days on these premises. I command you to seal\r\nit up and take it away.”\r\n\r\n“Surely,” said Patrick, with an innocent air, “the best remedy would be\r\nto wait till it _has been three days_ on the premises. We might all get\r\nto know each other better.” And he looked round at the ever-increasing\r\nmultitude with hazy benevolence.\r\n\r\n“You shall do nothing of the kind,” said his lordship, with sudden\r\nfierceness.\r\n\r\n“Well,” answered Patrick, wearily, “now I come to think of it, perhaps I\r\nwon’t. I’ll have one drink here and go home to bed like a good little\r\nboy.”\r\n\r\n“And the constables shall arrest you,” thundered Ivywood.\r\n\r\n“Why, nothing seems to suit you,” said the surprised Dalroy. “Thank you,\r\nhowever, for explaining the new law so clearly—‘unless alcoholic liquors\r\nhave been three days on the premises’ I shall remember it now. You\r\nalways explain such things so clearly. You only made one legal slip. The\r\nconstables will not arrest me.”\r\n\r\n“And why not?” demanded the nobleman, white with passion.\r\n\r\n“Because,” cried Patrick Dalroy; and his voice lifted itself like a\r\nlonely trumpet before the charge, “because I shall not have broken the\r\nlaw. Because alcoholic liquors _have_ been three days on these premises.\r\nThree months more likely. Because this is a common grog-shop, Phillip\r\nIvywood. Because that man behind the counter lives by selling spirits to\r\nall the cowards and hypocrites who are rich enough to bribe a bad\r\ndoctor.”\r\n\r\nAnd he pointed suddenly at the small medicine glass on the counter by\r\nHibbs and Leveson.\r\n\r\n“What is that man drinking?” he demanded.\r\n\r\nHibbs put out his hand hastily for his glass, but the indignant\r\nclock-mender had snatched it first and drained it at a gulp.\r\n\r\n“Scortch,” he said, and dashed the glass to atoms on the floor. “Right\r\nyou are too,” roared the plasterer, seizing a big medicine bottle in\r\neach hand. “We’re goin’ to ’ave a little of the fun now, we are. What’s\r\nin that big red bowl up there—I reckon it’s port. Fetch it down, Bill.”\r\n\r\nIvywood turned to Crooke and said, scarcely moving his lips of marble,\r\n“This is a lie.”\r\n\r\n“It is the truth,” answered Crooke, looking back at him with equal\r\nsteadiness. “Do you think you made the world, that you should make it\r\nover again so easily?”\r\n\r\n“The world was made badly,” said Phillip, with a terrible note in his\r\nvoice, “and _I will make it over again_.”\r\n\r\nAlmost as he spoke the glass front of the shop fell inward, shattered,\r\nand there was wreckage among the moonlike, coloured bowls; almost as if\r\nspheres of celestial crystal cracked at his blasphemy. Through the\r\nbroken windows came the roar of that confused tongue that is more\r\nterrible than the elements; the cry that the deaf kings have heard at\r\nlast; the terrible voice of mankind. All the way down the long,\r\nfashionable street, lined with the Crooke plate-glass, that glass was\r\ncrashing amid the cries of a crowd. Rivers of gold and purple wines\r\nsprawled about the pavement.\r\n\r\n“Out in the open!” shouted Dalroy, rushing out of the shop, sign-board\r\nin hand, the dog Quoodle barking furiously at his heels, while Dorian\r\nwith the cheese and Humphrey with the keg followed as rapidly as they\r\ncould. “Goodnight, my lord.\r\n\r\n                  “Perhaps our meeting next may fall,\r\n                     At Tomworth in your castle hall.\r\n\r\nCome along, friends, and form up. Don’t waste time destroying property.\r\nWe’re all to start now.”\r\n\r\n“Where are we all going to?” asked the plasterer.\r\n\r\n“We’re all going into Parliament,” answered the Captain, as he went to\r\nthe head of the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe marching crowd turned two or three corners, and at the end of the\r\nnext long street, Dorian Wimpole, who was toward the tail of the\r\nprocession, saw again the grey Cyclops tower of St. Stephens, with its\r\none great golden eye, as he had seen it against that pale green sunset\r\nthat was at once quiet and volcanic on the night he was betrayed by\r\nsleep and by a friend. Almost as far off, at the head of the procession,\r\nhe could see the sign with the ship and the cross going before them like\r\nan ensign, and hear a great voice singing—\r\n\r\n               “Men that are men again, Who goes home?\r\n                Tocsin and trumpeter! Who goes home?\r\n                The voice valedictory—who is for Victory?\r\n                Who is for Liberty? Who goes home?”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n                          THE MARCH ON IVYWOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT storm-spirit, or eagle of liberty, which is the sudden soul in a\r\ncrowd, had descended upon London after a foreign tour of some centuries\r\nin which it had commonly alighted upon other capitals. It is always\r\nimpossible to define the instant and the turn of mood which makes the\r\nwhole difference between danger being worse than endurance and endurance\r\nbeing worse than danger. The actual outbreak generally has a symbolic or\r\nartistic, or, what some would call whimsical cause. Somebody fires off a\r\npistol or appears in an unpopular uniform, or refers in a loud voice to\r\na scandal that is never mentioned in the newspapers; somebody takes off\r\nhis hat, or somebody doesn’t take off his hat; and a city is sacked\r\nbefore midnight. When the ever-swelling army of revolt smashed a whole\r\nstreet full of the shops of Mr. Crooke, the chemist, and then went on to\r\nParliament, the Tower of London and the road to the sea, the\r\nsociologists hiding in their coal-cellars could think (in that\r\nclarifying darkness) of many material and spiritual explanations of such\r\na storm in human souls; but of none that explained it quite enough.\r\nDoubtless there was a great deal of sheer drunkenness when the urns and\r\ngoblets of Æsculapius were reclaimed as belonging to Bacchus: and many\r\nwho went roaring down that road were merely stored with rich wines and\r\nliqueurs which are more comfortably and quietly digested at a City\r\nbanquet or a West End restaurant. But many of these had been blind drunk\r\ntwenty times without a thought of rebellion; you could not stretch the\r\nmaterial explanation to cover a corner of the case. Much more general\r\nwas a savage sense of the meanness of Crooke’s wealthy patrons, in\r\nkeeping a door open for themselves which they had wantonly shut on less\r\nhappy people. But no explanation can explain it; and no man can say when\r\nit will come.\r\n\r\nDorian Wimpole was at the tail of the procession, which grew more and\r\nmore crowded every moment. For one space of the march he even had the\r\nmisfortune to lose it altogether; owing to the startling activity which\r\nthe rotund cheese when it escaped from his hands showed, in descending a\r\nsomewhat steep road toward the river. But in recent days he had gained a\r\npleasure in practical events which was like a second youth. He managed\r\nto find a stray taxi-cab; and had little difficulty in picking up again\r\nthe trail of the extraordinary cortège. Inquiries addressed to a\r\npoliceman with a black eye outside the House of Commons informed him\r\nsufficiently of the rebels’ line of retreat or advance, or whatever it\r\nwas; and in a very short time he beheld the unmistakable legion once\r\nmore. It was unmistakable, because in front of it there walked a\r\nred-headed giant, apparently carrying with him a wooden portion of some\r\npublic building; and also because so big a crowd had never followed any\r\nman in England for a long time past. But except for such things the\r\nunmistakable crowd might well have been mistaken for another one. Its\r\naspect had been altered almost as much as if it had grown horns or\r\ntusks; for many of the company walked with outlandish weapons like iron\r\nteeth or horns, bills and pole axes, and spears with strangely shaped\r\nheads. What was stranger still, whole rows and rows of them had rifles,\r\nand even marched with a certain discipline; and yet again, others seemed\r\nto have snatched up household or workshop tools, meat axes, pick axes,\r\nhammers and even carving knives. Such things need be none the less\r\ndeadly because they are domestic. They have figured in millions of\r\nprivate murders before they appeared in any public war.\r\n\r\nDorian was so fortunate as to meet the flame-haired Captain almost face\r\nto face, and easily fell into step with him at the head of the march.\r\nHumphrey Pump walked on the other side, with the celebrated cask\r\nsuspended round his neck by something resembling braces, as if it were a\r\ndrum. Mr. Wimpole had himself taken the opportunity of his brief\r\nestrangement to carry the cheese somewhat more easily in a very large,\r\nloose, waterproof knapsack on his shoulders. The effect in both cases\r\nwas to suggest dreadful deformities in two persons who happened to be\r\nexceptionally cleanly built. The Captain, who seemed to be in tearing\r\nand towering spirits, gained great pleasure from this. But Dorian had\r\nhis sources of amusement too.\r\n\r\n“What have you been doing with yourselves since you lost my judicious\r\nguidance?” he asked, laughing, “and why are parts of you a dull review\r\nand parts of you a fancy dress ball? What have you been up to?”\r\n\r\n“We’ve been shopping,” said Mr. Patrick Dalroy, with some pride. “We are\r\ncountry cousins. I know all about shopping; let us see, what are the\r\nphrases about it? Look at those rifles now! We got them quite at a\r\nbargain. We went to all the best gunsmiths in London, and we didn’t pay\r\nmuch. In fact, we didn’t pay anything. That’s what is called a bargain,\r\nisn’t it? Surely, I’ve seen in those things they send to ladies\r\nsomething about ‘giving them away.’ Then we went to a remnant sale. At\r\nleast, it was a remnant sale when we left. And we bought that piece of\r\nstuff we’ve tied round the sign. Surely, it must be what ladies called\r\nchiffon?”\r\n\r\nDorian lifted his eyes and perceived that a very coarse strip of red\r\nrag, possibly collected from a dustbin, had been tied round the wooden\r\nsign-post by way of a red flag of revolution.\r\n\r\n“Not what ladies call chiffon?” inquired the Captain with anxiety.\r\n“Well, anyhow, it is what _chiffoniers_ call it. But as I’m going to\r\ncall on a lady shortly, I’ll try to remember the distinction.”\r\n\r\n“Is your shopping over, may I ask?” asked Mr. Wimpole.\r\n\r\n“All but one thing,” answered the other. “I must find a music shop—you\r\nknow what I mean. Place where they sell pianos and things of that sort.”\r\n\r\n“Look here,” said Dorian, “this cheese is pretty heavy as it is. Have I\r\ngot to carry a piano, too?”\r\n\r\n“You misunderstand me,” said the Captain, calmly. And as he had never\r\nthought of music shops until his eye had caught one an instant before,\r\nhe darted into the doorway. Returning almost immediately with a long\r\nparcel under his arm, he resumed the conversation.\r\n\r\n“Did you go anywhere else,” asked Dorian, “except to shops?”\r\n\r\n“Anywhere else!” cried Patrick, indignantly, “haven’t you got any\r\ncountry cousins? Of course we went to all the right places. We went to\r\nthe Houses of Parliament. But Parliament isn’t sitting; so there are no\r\neggs of the quality suitable for elections. We went to the Tower of\r\nLondon—you can’t tire country cousins like us. We took away some\r\ncuriosities of steel and iron. We even took away the halberds from the\r\nBeef-eaters. We pointed out that for the purpose of eating beef (their\r\nonly avowed public object) knives and forks had always been found more\r\nconvenient. To tell the truth, they seemed rather relieved to be\r\nrelieved of them.”\r\n\r\n“And may I ask,” said the other with a smile, “where you are off to\r\nnow?”\r\n\r\n“Another beauty spot!” cried the Captain, boisterously, “no tiring the\r\ncountry cousin! I am going to show my young friends from the provinces\r\nwhat is perhaps the finest old country house in England. We are going to\r\nIvywood, not far from that big watering place they call Pebblewick.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Dorian; and for the first time looked back with\r\nintelligent trouble on his face, on the marching ranks behind him.\r\n\r\n“Captain Dalroy,” said Dorian Wimpole, in a slightly altered tone,\r\n“there is one thing that puzzles me. Ivywood talked about having set the\r\npolice to catch us; and though this is a pretty big crowd, I simply\r\ncannot believe that the police, as I knew them in my youth, could not\r\ncatch us. But where are the police? You seem to have marched through\r\nhalf London with much (if you’ll excuse me) of the appearance of\r\ncarrying murderous weapons. Lord Ivywood threatened that the police\r\nwould stop us. Well, why didn’t they stop us?”\r\n\r\n“Your subject,” said Patrick, cheerfully, “divides itself into three\r\nheads.”\r\n\r\n“I hope not,” said Dorian.\r\n\r\n“There really are three reasons why the police should not be prominent\r\nin this business; as their worst enemy cannot say that they were.”\r\n\r\nHe began ticking off the three on his own huge fingers; and seemed to be\r\nquite serious about it.\r\n\r\n“First,” he said, “you have been a long time away from town. Probably\r\nyou do not know a policeman when you see him. They do not wear helmets,\r\nas our line regiments did after the Prussians had won. They wear fezzes,\r\nbecause the Turks have won. Shortly, I have little doubt, they will wear\r\npigtails, because the Chinese have won. It is a very interesting branch\r\nof moral science. It is called Efficiency.\r\n\r\n“Second,” explained the Captain, “you have, perhaps, omitted to notice\r\nthat a very considerable number of those wearing such fezzes are walking\r\njust behind us. Oh, yes, it’s quite true. Don’t you remember that the\r\nwhole French Revolution really began because a sort of City Militia\r\nrefused to fire on their own fathers and wives; and even showed some\r\nslight traces of a taste for firing on the other side? You’ll see lots\r\nof them behind; and you can tell them by their revolver belts and their\r\nwalking in step; but don’t look back on them too much. It makes them\r\nnervous.”\r\n\r\n“And the third reason?” asked Dorian.\r\n\r\n“For the real reason,” answered Patrick, “I am not fighting a hopeless\r\nfight. People who have fought in real fights don’t, as a rule. But I\r\nnoticed something singular about the very point you mention. Why are\r\nthere no more police? Why are there no more soldiers? I will tell you.\r\nThere really are very few policemen or soldiers left in England today.”\r\n\r\n“Surely, that,” said Wimpole, “is an unusual complaint.”\r\n\r\n“But very clear,” said the Captain, gravely, “to anyone who has ever\r\nseen sailors or soldiers. I will tell you the truth. Our rulers have\r\ncome to count on the bare bodily cowardice of a mass of Englishmen, as a\r\nsheep dog counts on the cowardice of a flock of sheep. Now, look here,\r\nMr. Wimpole, wouldn’t a shepherd be wise to limit the number of his dogs\r\nif he could make his sheep pay by it? At the end you might find millions\r\nof sheep managed by a solitary dog. But that is because they are sheep.\r\nSuppose the sheep were turned by a miracle into wolves. There are very\r\nfew dogs they could not tear in pieces. But, what is my practical point,\r\nthere are really very few dogs to tear.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean,” said Dorian, “that the British Army is practically\r\ndisbanded?”\r\n\r\n“There are the sentinels outside Whitehall,” replied Patrick, in a low\r\nvoice. “But, indeed, your question puts me in a difficulty. No; the army\r\nis not entirely disbanded, of course. But the _British_ army—. Did you\r\never hear, Wimpole, of the great destiny of the Empire?”\r\n\r\n“I seem to have heard the phrase,” replied his companion.\r\n\r\n“It is in four acts,” said Dalroy. “Victory over barbarians. Employment\r\nof barbarians. Alliance with barbarians. Conquest by barbarians. That is\r\nthe great destiny of Empire.”\r\n\r\n“I think I begin to see what you mean,” returned Dorian Wimpole. “Of\r\ncourse Ivywood and the authorities do seem very prone to rely on the\r\nsepoy troops.”\r\n\r\n“And other troops as well,” said Patrick. “I think you will be surprised\r\nwhen you see them.”\r\n\r\nHe tramped on for a while in silence and then said, with some air of\r\nabruptness, which yet did not seem to be entirely a changing of the\r\nsubject,\r\n\r\n“Do you know the man who lives now on the estate next to Ivywood?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Dorian, “I am told he keeps himself very much to himself.”\r\n\r\n“And his estate, too,” said Patrick, rather gloomily. “If you would\r\nclimb his garden-wall, Wimpole, I think you would find an answer to a\r\ngood many of your questions. Oh, yes, the right honourable gentlemen are\r\nmaking full provision for public order and national defence—in a way.”\r\n\r\nHe fell into an almost sullen silence again; and several villages had\r\nbeen passed before he spoke again.\r\n\r\nThey tramped through the darkness; and dawn surprised them somewhere in\r\nthe wilder and more wooded parts where the roads began to rise and roam.\r\nDalroy gave an exclamation of pleasure and pointed ahead, drawing the\r\nattention of Dorian to the distance. Against the silver and scarlet bars\r\nof the daybreak could be seen afar a dark purple dome, with a crown of\r\ndark green leaves; the place they had called Roundabout.\r\n\r\nDalroy’s spirit seemed to revive at the sight, with the customary\r\naccompaniment of the threat of vocalism.\r\n\r\n“Been making any poems lately?” he asked of Wimpole.\r\n\r\n“Nothing particular,” replied the poet.\r\n\r\n“Then,” said the Captain, portentously, clearing his throat, “you shall\r\nlisten to one of mine, whether you like it or not—nay, the more you\r\ndislike it the longer and longer it will be. I begin to understand why\r\nsoldiers want to sing when on the march; and also why they put up with\r\nsuch rotten songs.\r\n\r\n               “The Druids waved their golden knives\r\n                And danced around the Oak,\r\n                When they had sacrificed a man;\r\n                But though the learnèd search and scan\r\n                No single modern person can\r\n                Entirely see the joke;\r\n                But though they cut the throats of men\r\n                They cut not down the tree,\r\n                And from the blood the saplings sprang\r\n                Of oak-woods yet to be.\r\n                  But Ivywood, Lord Ivywood,\r\n                  He rots the tree as ivy would,\r\n                  He clings and crawls as ivy would\r\n                  About the sacred tree.\r\n\r\n               “King Charles he fled from Worcester fight\r\n                And hid him in an Oak;\r\n                In convent schools no man of tact\r\n                Would trace and praise his every act,\r\n                Or argue that he was in fact\r\n                A strict and sainted bloke;\r\n                But not by him the sacred woods\r\n                Have lost their fancies free,\r\n                And though he was extremely big,\r\n                He did not break the tree.\r\n                  But Ivywood, Lord Ivywood,\r\n                  He breaks the tree as ivy would\r\n                  And eats the woods as ivy would\r\n                  Between us and the sea.\r\n\r\n               “Great Collingwood walked down the glade\r\n                And flung the acorns free,\r\n                That oaks might still be in the grove\r\n                As oaken as the beams above\r\n                When the great Lover sailors love\r\n                Was kissed by Death at sea.\r\n                But though for him the oak-trees fell\r\n                To build the oaken ships,\r\n                The woodman worshipped what he smote\r\n                And honoured even the chips.\r\n                   But Ivywood, Lord Ivywood,\r\n                   He hates the tree as ivy would,\r\n                   As the dragon of the ivy would,\r\n                   That has us in his grips.”\r\n\r\nThey were ascending a sloping road, walled in on both sides by solemn\r\nwoods, which somehow seemed as watchful as owls awake. Though daybreak\r\nwas going over them with banners, scrolls of scarlet and gold, and with\r\na wind like trumpets of triumph, the dark woods seemed to hold their\r\nsecret like dark, cool cellars; nor was the strong sunlight seen in\r\nthem, save in one or two brilliant shafts, that looked like splintered\r\nemeralds.\r\n\r\n“I should not wonder,” said Dorian, “if the ivy does not find the tree\r\nknows a thing or two also.”\r\n\r\n“The tree does,” assented the Captain. “The trouble was that until a\r\nlittle while ago the tree did not know that it knew.”\r\n\r\nThere was a silence; and as they went up the incline grew steeper and\r\nsteeper, and the tall trees seemed more and more to be guarding\r\nsomething from sight, as with the grey shields of giants.\r\n\r\n“Do you remember this road, Hump?” asked Dalroy of the innkeeper.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Humphrey Pump, and said no more; but few have ever heard\r\nsuch fulness in an affirmative.\r\n\r\nThey marched on in silence and about two hours afterward, toward eleven\r\no’clock, Dalroy called a halt in the forest, and said that everybody had\r\nbetter have a few hours’ sleep. The impenetrable quality in the woods\r\nand the comparative softness of the carpet of beech-mast, made the spot\r\nas appropriate as the time was inappropriate. And if anyone thinks that\r\ncommon people, casually picked up in a street, could not follow a random\r\nleader on such a journey or sleep at his command in such a spot, given\r\nthe state of the soul, then someone knows no history.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid,” said Dalroy, “you’ll have to have your supper for\r\nbreakfast. I know an excellent place for having breakfast, but it’s too\r\nexposed for sleep. And sleep you must have; so we won’t unpack the\r\nstores just now. We’ll lie down like Babes in the Wood, and any bird of\r\nan industrious disposition is free to start covering me with leaves.\r\nReally, there are things coming, before which you will want sleep.”\r\n\r\nWhen they resumed the march it was nearly the middle of the afternoon;\r\nand the meal which Dalroy insisted buoyantly on describing as breakfast\r\nwas taken about that mysterious hour when ladies die without tea. The\r\nsteep road had consistently grown steeper and steeper; and steeper; and\r\nat last, Dalroy said to Dorian Wimpole,\r\n\r\n“Don’t drop that cheese again just here, or it will roll right away down\r\ninto the woods. I know it will. No scientific calculations of grades and\r\nangles are necessary; because I have seen it do so myself. In fact, I\r\nhave run after it.”\r\n\r\nWimpole realised they were mounting to the sharp edge of a ridge, and in\r\na few moments he knew by the oddness in the shape of the trees what it\r\nhad been that the trees were hiding.\r\n\r\nThey had been walking along a swelling, woodland path beside the sea. On\r\na particular high plateau, projecting above the shore, stood some\r\ndwarfed and crippled apple-trees, of whose apples no man alive would\r\nhave eaten, so sour and salt they must be. All the rest of the plateau\r\nwas bald and featureless, but Pump looked at every inch of it, as if at\r\nan inhabited place.\r\n\r\n“This is where we’ll have breakfast,” he said, pointing to the naked\r\ngrassy waste. “It’s the best inn in England.”\r\n\r\nSome of his audience began to laugh, but somehow suddenly ceased doing\r\nso, as Dalroy strode forward and planted the sign of “The Old Ship” on\r\nthe desolate sea-shore.\r\n\r\n“And now,” he said, “you have charge of the stores we brought, Hump, and\r\nwe will picnic. As it said in a song I once sang,\r\n\r\n             “The Saracen’s Head out of Araby came,\r\n              King Richard riding in arms like flame,\r\n              And where he established his folk to be fed\r\n              He set up his spear, and the Saracen’s Head.”\r\n\r\nIt was nearly dusk before the mob, much swelled by the many discontented\r\non the Ivywood estates, reached the gates of Ivywood House.\r\nStrategically, and for the purposes of a night surprise, this might have\r\ndone credit to the Captain’s military capacity. But the use to which he\r\nput it actually was what some might call eccentric. When he had disposed\r\nhis forces, with strict injunctions of silence for the first few\r\nminutes, he turned to Pump, and said,\r\n\r\n“And now, before we do anything else, I’m going to make a noise.”\r\n\r\nAnd he produced from under brown paper what appeared to be a musical\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n“A summons to parley?” inquired Dorian, with interest, “a trumpet of\r\ndefiance, or something of that kind?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Patrick, “a serenade.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n                        THE ENIGMAS OF LADY JOAN\r\n\r\n\r\nON an evening when the sky was clear and only its fringes embroidered\r\nwith the purple arabesques of the sunset, Joan Brett was walking on the\r\nupper lawn of the terraced garden at Ivywood, where the peacocks trail\r\nthemselves about. She was not unlike one of the peacocks herself in\r\nbeauty, and some might have said, in inutility; she had the proud head\r\nand the sweeping train; nor was she, in these days, devoid of the\r\noccasional disposition to scream. For, indeed, for some time past she\r\nhad felt her existence closing round her with an incomprehensible\r\nquietude; and that is harder for the patience than an incomprehensible\r\nnoise. Whenever she looked at the old yew hedges of the garden they\r\nseemed to be higher than when she saw them last; as if those living\r\nwalls could still grow to shut her in. Whenever from the turret windows\r\nshe had a sight of the sea, it seemed to be farther away. Indeed, the\r\nwhole closing of the end of the turret wing with the new wall of eastern\r\nwoodwork seemed to symbolise all her shapeless sensations. In her\r\nchildhood the wing had ended with a broken-down door and a disused\r\nstaircase. They led to an uncultivated copse and an abandoned railway\r\ntunnel, to which neither she nor anyone else ever wanted to go. Still,\r\nshe knew what they led to. Now it seemed that this scrap of land had\r\nbeen sold and added to the adjoining estate; and about the adjoining\r\nestate nobody seemed to know anything in particular. The sense of things\r\nclosing in increased upon her. All sorts of silly little details\r\nmagnified the sensation. She could discover nothing about this new\r\nlandlord next door, so to speak, since he was, it seemed, an elderly man\r\nwho preferred to live in the greatest privacy. Miss Browning, Lord\r\nIvywood’s secretary, could give her no further information than that he\r\nwas a gentleman from the Mediterranean coast; which singular form of\r\nwords seemed to have been put into her mouth. As a Mediterranean\r\ngentleman might mean anything from an American gentleman living in\r\nVenice to a black African on the edge of the Atlas, the description did\r\nnot illuminate; and probably was not intended to do so. She occasionally\r\nsaw his liveried servants going about; and their liveries were not like\r\nEnglish liveries. She was also, in her somewhat morbid state, annoyed by\r\nthe fact that the uniforms of the old Pebblewick militia had been\r\nchanged, under the influence of the Turkish _prestige_ in the recent\r\nwar. They wore fezzes like the French Zouaves, which were certainly much\r\nmore practical than the heavy helmets they used to wear. It was a small\r\nmatter, but it annoyed Lady Joan, who was, like so many clever women, at\r\nonce subtle and conservative. It made her feel as if the whole world was\r\nbeing altered outside, and she was not allowed to know about it.\r\n\r\nBut she had deeper spiritual troubles also, while, under the pathetic\r\nentreaties of old Lady Ivywood and her own sick mother, she stayed on\r\nweek after week at Ivywood House. If the matter be stated cynically (as\r\nshe herself was quite capable of stating it) she was engaged in the\r\nestablished feminine occupation of trying to like a man. But the\r\ncynicism would have been false; as cynicism nearly always is; for during\r\nthe most crucial days of that period, she had really liked the man.\r\n\r\nShe had liked him when he was brought in with Pump’s bullet in his\r\nleg; and was still the strongest and calmest man in the room. She had\r\nliked him when the hurt took a dangerous turn, and when he bore pain\r\nto admiration. She had liked him when he showed no malice against the\r\nangry Dorian; she had liked him with something like enthusiasm on the\r\nnight he rose rigid on his rude crutch, and, crushing all\r\nremonstrance, made his rash and swift rush to London. But, despite the\r\nqueer closing-in-sensations of which we have spoken, she never liked\r\nhim better than that evening when he lifted himself laboriously on his\r\ncrutch up the terraces of the old garden and came to speak to her as\r\nshe stood among the peacocks. He even tried to pat a peacock in a hazy\r\nway, as if it were a dog. He told her that these beautiful birds were,\r\nof course, imported from the East—by the semi-eastern empire of\r\nMacedonia. But, all the same, Joan had a dim suspicion that he had\r\nnever noticed before that there were any peacocks at Ivywood. His\r\ngreatest fault was a pride in the faultlessness of his mental and\r\nmoral strength; but, if he had only known, something faintly comic in\r\nthe unconscious side of him did him more good with the woman than all\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\n“They were said to be the birds of Juno,” he said, “but I have little\r\ndoubt that Juno, like so much else of the Homeric mythology, has also an\r\nAsiatic origin.”\r\n\r\n“I always thought,” said Joan, “that Juno was rather too stately for the\r\nseraglio.”\r\n\r\n“You ought to know,” replied Ivywood, with a courteous gesture, “for I\r\n_never_ saw anyone who looked so like Juno as you do. But, indeed, there\r\nis a great deal of misunderstanding about the Arabian or Indian view of\r\nwomen. It is, somehow, too simple and solid for our paradoxical\r\nChristendom to comprehend. Even the vulgar joke against the Turks, that\r\nthey like their brides fat, has in it a sort of distorted shadow of what\r\nI mean. They do not look so much at the individual, as at Womanhood and\r\nthe power of Nature.”\r\n\r\n“I sometimes think,” said Joan, “that these fascinating theories are a\r\nlittle strained. Your friend Misysra told me the other day that women\r\nhad the highest freedom in Turkey; as they were allowed to wear\r\ntrousers.”\r\n\r\nIvywood smiled his rare and dry smile. “The Prophet has something of a\r\nsimplicity often found with genius,” he answered. “I will not deny that\r\nsome of the arguments he has employed have seemed to me crude and even\r\nfanciful. But he is right at the root. There is a kind of freedom that\r\nconsists in never rebelling against Nature; and I think they understand\r\nit in the Orient better than we do in the West. You see, Joan, it is all\r\nvery well to talk about love in our narrow, personal, romantic way; but\r\nthere is something higher than the love of a lover or the love of love.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?” asked Joan, looking down.\r\n\r\n“The love of Fate,” said Lord Ivywood, with something like spiritual\r\npassion in his eyes. “Doesn’t Nietzsche say somewhere that the delight\r\nin destiny is the mark of the hero? We are mistaken if we think that the\r\nheroes and saints of Islam say ‘Kismet’ with bowed heads and in sorrow.\r\nThey say ‘Kismet’ with a shout of joy. That which is fitting—that is\r\nwhat they really mean. In the Arabian tales, the most perfect prince is\r\nwedded to the most perfect princess—because it is fitting. The spiritual\r\ngiants, the Genii, achieve it—that is, the purposes of Nature. In the\r\nselfish, sentimental European novels, the loveliest princess on earth\r\nmight have run away with her middle-aged drawing-master. These things\r\nare not in the Path. The Turk rides out to wed the fairest queen of the\r\nearth; he conquers empires to do it; and he is not ashamed of his\r\nlaurels.”\r\n\r\nThe crumpled violet clouds around the edge of the silver evening looked\r\nto Lady Joan more and more like vivid violet embroideries hemming some\r\nsilver curtain in the closed corridor at Ivywood. The peacocks looked\r\nmore lustrous and beautiful than they ever had before; but for the first\r\ntime she really felt they came out of the land of the Arabian Nights.\r\n\r\n“Joan,” said Phillip Ivywood, very softly, in the twilight, “I am not\r\nashamed of my laurels. I see no meaning in what these Christians call\r\nhumility. I will be the greatest man in the world if I can; and I think\r\nI can. Therefore, something that is higher than love itself, Fate and\r\nwhat is fitting, make it right that I should wed the most beautiful\r\nwoman in the world. And she stands among the peacocks and is more\r\nbeautiful and more proud than they.”\r\n\r\nJoan’s troubled eyes were on the violet horizon and her troubled lips\r\ncould utter nothing but something like “don’t.”\r\n\r\n“Joan,” said Phillip, again, “I have told you, you are the woman one of\r\nthe great heroes could have desired. Let me now tell you something I\r\ncould have told no one to whom I had not thus spoken of love and\r\nbetrothal. When I was twenty years old in a town in Germany, pursuing my\r\neducation, I did what the West calls falling in love. She was a\r\nfisher-girl from the coast; for this town was near the sea. My story\r\nmight have ended there. I could not have entered diplomacy with such a\r\nwife, but I should not have minded then. But a little while after, I\r\nwandered into the edges of Flanders, and found myself standing above\r\nsome of the last grand reaches of the Rhine. And things came over me but\r\nfor which I might be crying stinking fish to this day. I thought how\r\nmany holy or lovely nooks that river had left behind, and gone on. It\r\nmight anywhere in Switzerland have spent its weak youth in a spirit over\r\na high crag, or anywhere in the Rhinelands lost itself in a marsh\r\ncovered with flowers. But it went on to the perfect sea, which is the\r\nfulfilment of a river.”\r\n\r\nAgain, Joan could not speak; and again it was Phillip who went on.\r\n\r\n“Here is yet another thing that could not be said, till the hand of the\r\nprince had been offered to the princess. It may be that in the East they\r\ncarry too far this matter of infant marriages. But look round on the mad\r\nyoung marriages that go to pieces everywhere! And ask yourself whether\r\nyou don’t wish they had been infant marriages! People talk in the\r\nnewspapers of the heartlessness of royal marriages. But you and I do not\r\nbelieve the newspapers, I suppose. We know there is no King in England;\r\nnor has been since his head fell before Whitehall. You know that you and\r\nI and the families are the Kings of England; and our marriages are royal\r\nmarriages. Let the suburbs call them heartless. Let us say they need the\r\nbrave heart that is the only badge of aristocracy. Joan,” he said, very\r\ngently, “perhaps you have been near a crag in Switzerland, or a marsh\r\ncovered with flowers. Perhaps you have known—a fisher-girl. But there is\r\nsomething greater and simpler than all that; something you find in the\r\ngreat epics of the East—the beautiful woman, and the great man, and\r\nFate.”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” said Joan, using the formal phrase by an unfathomable\r\ninstinct, “will you allow me a little more time to think of this? And\r\nlet there be no notion of disloyalty, if my decision is one way or the\r\nother?”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course,” said Ivywood, bowing over his crutch; and he limped\r\noff, picking his way among the peacocks.\r\n\r\nFor days afterward Joan tried to build the foundations of her earthly\r\ndestiny. She was still quite young, but she felt as if she had lived\r\nthousands of years, worrying over the same question. She told herself\r\nagain and again, and truly, that many a better woman than she had taken\r\na second-best which was not so first-class a second-best. But there was\r\nsomething complicated in the very atmosphere. She liked listening to\r\nPhillip Ivywood at his best, as anyone likes listening to a man who can\r\nreally play the violin; but the great trouble always is that at certain\r\nawful moments you cannot be certain whether it is the violin or the man.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there was a curious tone and spirit in the Ivywood household,\r\nespecially after the wound and convalescence of Ivywood, about which she\r\ncould say nothing except that it annoyed her somehow. There was\r\nsomething in it glorious—but also languorous. By an impulse by no means\r\nuncommon among intelligent, fashionable people, she felt a desire to\r\ntalk to a sensible woman of the middle or lower classes; and almost\r\nthrew herself on the bosom of Miss Browning for sympathy.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Browning, with her curling, reddish hair and white, very clever\r\nface, struck the same indescribable note. Lord Ivywood was assumed as a\r\nfirst principle; as if he were Father Time, or the Clerk of the Weather.\r\nHe was called “He.” The fifth time he was called “He,” Joan could not\r\nunderstand why she seemed to smell the plants in the hot conservatory.\r\n\r\n“You see,” said Miss Browning, “we mustn’t interfere with his career;\r\nthat is the important thing. And, really, I think the quieter we keep\r\nabout everything the better. I am sure he is maturing very big plans.\r\nYou heard what the Prophet said the other night?”\r\n\r\n“The last thing the Prophet said to me,” said the darker lady, in a\r\ndogged manner, “was that when we English see the English youth, we cry\r\nout ‘He is crescent!’ But when we see the English aged man, we cry out\r\n‘He is cross!’”\r\n\r\nA lady with so clever a face could not but laugh faintly; but she\r\ncontinued on a determined theme, “The Prophet said, you know, that all\r\nreal love had in it an element of fate. And I am sure that is his view,\r\ntoo. People cluster round a centre as little stars do round a star;\r\nbecause a star is a magnet. You are never wrong when destiny blows\r\nbehind you like a great big wind; and I think many things have been\r\njudged unfairly that way. It’s all very well to talk about the infant\r\nmarriages in India.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Browning,” said Joan, “are you interested in the infant marriages\r\nin India?”\r\n\r\n“Well—” said Miss Browning.\r\n\r\n“Is your sister interested in them? I’ll run and ask her,” cried Joan,\r\nplunging across the room to where Mrs. Mackintosh was sitting at a table\r\nscribbling secretarial notes.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mrs. Mackintosh, turning up a rich-haired, resolute head,\r\nmore handsome than her sister’s, “I believe the Indian way is the best.\r\nWhen people are left to themselves in early youth, any of them might\r\nmarry anything. We might have married a nigger or a fish-wife or—a\r\ncriminal.”\r\n\r\n“Now, Mrs. Mackintosh,” said Joan, with black-browed severity, “you well\r\nknow you would never have married a fish-wife. Where is Enid?” she ended\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n“Lady Enid,” said Miss Browning, “is looking out music in the music\r\nroom, I think.”\r\n\r\nJoan walked swiftly through several long salons, and found her\r\nfair-haired and pallid relative actually at the piano.\r\n\r\n“Enid,” cried Joan, “you know I’ve always been fond of you. For God’s\r\nsake tell me what is the matter with this house? I admire Phillip as\r\neverybody does. But what is the matter with the house? Why do all these\r\nrooms and gardens seem to be shutting me in and in and in? Why does\r\neverything look more and more the same? Why does everybody say the same\r\nthing? Oh, I don’t often talk metaphysics; but there is a purpose in\r\nthis. That’s the only way of putting it; there is a purpose. And I don’t\r\nknow what it is.”\r\n\r\nLady Enid Wimpole played a preliminary bar or two on the piano. Then she\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n“Nor do I, Joan. I don’t indeed. I know exactly what you mean. But it’s\r\njust because there is a purpose that I have faith in him and trust him.”\r\nShe began softly to play a ballad tune of the Rhineland; and perhaps the\r\nmusic suggested her next remark. “Suppose you were looking at some of\r\nthe last reaches of the Rhine, where it flows—”\r\n\r\n“Enid!” cried Joan, “if you say ‘into the North Sea,’ I shall scream.\r\nScream, do you hear, louder than all the peacocks together.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” expostulated Lady Enid, looking up rather wildly, “The Rhine\r\n_does_ flow into the North Sea, doesn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“I dare say,” said Joan, recklessly, “but the Rhine might have flowed\r\ninto the Round Pond, before you would have known or cared, until—”\r\n\r\n“Until what?” asked Enid; and her music suddenly ceased. “Until\r\nsomething happened that I cannot understand,” said Joan, moving away.\r\n\r\n“_You_ are something I cannot understand,” said Enid Wimpole. “But I\r\nwill play something else, if this annoys you.” And she fingered the\r\nmusic again with an eye to choice.\r\n\r\nJoan walked back through the corridor of the music room, and restlessly\r\nresumed her seat in the room with the two lady secretaries.\r\n\r\n“Well,” asked the red-haired and good-humoured Mrs. Mackintosh, without\r\nlooking up from her work of scribbling, “have you discovered anything?”\r\n\r\nFor some moments Joan appeared to be in a blacker state of brooding than\r\nusual; then she said, in a candid and friendly tone, which somehow\r\ncontrasted with her knit and swarthy brows—\r\n\r\n“No, really. At least I think I’ve only found out two things; and they\r\nare only things about myself. I’ve discovered that I do like heroism,\r\nbut I don’t like hero worship.”\r\n\r\n“Surely,” said Miss Browning, in the Girton manner, “the one always\r\nflows from the other.”\r\n\r\n“I hope not,” said Joan.\r\n\r\n“But what else can you do with the hero?” asked Mrs. Mackintosh, still\r\nwithout looking up from her writing, “except worship him?”\r\n\r\n“You might crucify him,” said Joan, with a sudden return of savage\r\nrestlessness, as she rose from her chair. “Things seem to happen then.”\r\n\r\n“Aren’t you tired?” asked the Miss Browning who had the clever face.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Joan, “and the worst sort of tiredness; when you don’t even\r\nknow what you’re tired of. To tell the honest truth, I think I’m tired\r\nof this house.”\r\n\r\n“It’s very old, of course, and parts of it are still dismal,” said Miss\r\nBrowning, “but he has enormously improved it. The decoration, with the\r\nmoon and stars, down in the wing with the turret is really—”\r\n\r\nAway in the distant music room, Lady Enid, having found the music she\r\npreferred, was fingering its prelude on the piano. At the first few\r\nnotes of it, Joan Brett stood up, like a tigress.\r\n\r\n“Thanks—” she said, with a hoarse softness, “that’s it, of course! and\r\nthat’s just what we all are! She’s found the right tune now.”\r\n\r\n“What tune is it?” asked the wondering secretary.\r\n\r\n“The tune of harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer and all kinds of music,”\r\nsaid Joan, softly and fiercely, “when we shall bow down and worship the\r\nGolden Image that Nebuchadnezzar the King has set up. Girls! Women! Do\r\nyou know what this place is? Do you know why it is all doors within\r\ndoors and lattice behind lattice; and everything is curtained and\r\ncushioned; and why the flowers that are so fragrant here are not the\r\nflowers of our hills?”\r\n\r\nFrom the distant and slowly darkening music room, Enid Wimpole’s song\r\ncame thin and clear:\r\n\r\n           “Less than the dust beneath thy chariot wheel,\r\n            Less than the rust that never stained thy sword—”\r\n\r\n“Do you know what we are?” demanded Joan Brett, again. “We are a Harem.”\r\n\r\n“Why, what can you mean?” cried the younger girl, in great agitation.\r\n“Why, Lord Ivywood has never—”\r\n\r\n“I know he has never. I am not sure,” said Joan, “even whether he would\r\never. I shall never understand that man, nor will anybody else. But I\r\ntell you that is the spirit. That is what we _are_. And this room stinks\r\nof polygamy as certainly as it smells of tube-roses.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Joan,” cried Lady Enid, entering the room like a well-bred ghost,\r\n“what on earth is the matter with you. You all look as white as sheets.”\r\n\r\nJoan took no heed of her but went on with her own obstinate argument.\r\n\r\n“And, besides,” she said, “if there’s one thing we do know about him it\r\nis that he believes on principle in doing things slowly. He calls it\r\nevolution and relativity and the expanding of an idea into larger ideas.\r\nHow do we know he isn’t doing that slowly; getting us accustomed to\r\nliving like this, so that it may be the less shock when he goes\r\nfurther—steeping us in the atmosphere before he actually introduces,”\r\nand she shuddered, “the institution. Is it any more calmly outrageous a\r\nscheme than any other of Ivywood’s schemes; than a sepoy\r\ncommander-in-chief, or Misysra preaching in Westminster Abbey, or the\r\ndestruction of all the inns in England? I will not wait and expand. I\r\nwill not be evolved. I will not develop into something that is not me.\r\nMy feet shall be outside these walls if I walk the roads for it\r\nafterward; or I will scream as I would scream trapped in any den by the\r\nDocks.”\r\n\r\nShe swept down the rooms toward the turret, with a sudden passion for\r\nsolitude; but as she passed the astronomical wood-carving that had\r\nclosed up the end of the old wing, Enid saw her strike it with her\r\nclinched hand.\r\n\r\nIt was in the turret that she had a strange experience. She was again,\r\nlater on, using its isolation to worry out the best way of having it out\r\nwith Phillip, when he should return from his visit to London; for to\r\ntell old Lady Ivywood what was on her mind would be about as kind and\r\nuseful as describing Chinese tortures to a baby. The evening was very\r\nquiet, of the pale grey sort, and all that side of Ivywood lay before\r\nher eyes, undisturbed. She was the more surprised when her dreaming took\r\nnote of a sort of stirring in the grey-purple dusk of the bushes; of\r\nwhisperings; and of many footsteps. Then the silence settled down again;\r\nand then it was startlingly broken by a big voice singing in the dark\r\ndistance. It was accompanied by faint sounds that might have been from\r\nthe fingering of some lute or viol:\r\n\r\n “Lady, the light is dying in the skies,\r\n  Lady, and let us die when honour dies,\r\n  Your dear, dropped glove was like a gauntlet flung,\r\n       When you and I were young.\r\n  For something more than splendour stood; and ease was not the only good\r\n  About the woods in Ivywood when you and I were young.\r\n\r\n “Lady, the stars are falling pale and small,\r\n  Lady, we will not live if life be all\r\n  Forgetting those good stars in heaven hung\r\n       When all the world was young,\r\n  For more than gold was in a ring, and love was not a little thing\r\n  Between the trees in Ivywood when all the world was young.”\r\n\r\nThe singing ceased; and the bustle in the bushes could hardly be called\r\nmore than a whisper. But sounds of the same sort and somewhat louder\r\nseemed wafted round corners from other sides of the house; and the whole\r\nnight seemed full of something that was alive, but was more than a\r\nsingle man.\r\n\r\nShe heard a cry behind her, and Enid rushed into the room as white as\r\none of the lilies.\r\n\r\n“What awful thing is happening?” she cried. “The courtyard is full of\r\nmen shouting, and there are torches everywhere and—”\r\n\r\nJoan heard a tramp of men marching and heard, afar off, another song,\r\nsung on a more derisive note, something like—\r\n\r\n                    “But Ivywood, Lord Ivywood,\r\n                     He rots the tree as ivy would.”\r\n\r\n“I think,” said Joan, thoughtfully, “it is the End of the World.”\r\n\r\n“But where are the police?” wailed her cousin. “They don’t seem to be\r\nanywhere about since they wore those fezzes. We shall be murdered or—”\r\n\r\nThree thundering and measured blows shook the decorative wood panelling\r\nat the end of the wing; as if admittance were demanded with the club of\r\na giant. Enid remembered that she had thought Joan’s little blow\r\nenergetic, and shuddered. Both the girls stared at the stars and moons\r\nand suns blazoned on that sacred wall that leapt and shuddered under the\r\nstrokes of the doom.\r\n\r\nThen the sun fell from Heaven, and the moon and stars dropped down and\r\nwere scattered about the Persian carpet; and by the opening of the end\r\nof the world, Patrick Dalroy came in, carrying a mandolin.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n                      THE FINDING OF THE SUPERMAN\r\n\r\n\r\n“I’VE brought you a little dog,” said Mr. Dalroy, introducing the\r\nrampant Quoodle. “I had him brought down here in a large hamper labelled\r\n‘Explosives,’ a title which appears to have been well selected.”\r\n\r\nHe had bowed to Lady Enid on entering and taken Joan’s hand with the\r\nleast suggestion that he wanted to do something else with it; but he\r\nresolutely resumed his conversation, which was on the subject of dogs.\r\n\r\n“People who bring back dogs,” he said, “are always under a cloud of\r\nsuspicion. Sometimes it is hideously hinted that the citizen who brings\r\nthe dog back with him is identical with the citizen who took the dog\r\naway with him. In my case, of course, such conduct is inconceivable. But\r\nthe returners of dogs, that prosperous and increasing class, are also\r\naccused,” he went on, looking straight at Joan, with blank blue eyes,\r\n“of coming back for a Reward. There is more truth in this charge.”\r\n\r\nThen, with a change of manner more extraordinary than any revolution,\r\neven the revolution that was roaring round the house, he took her hand\r\nagain and kissed it, saying, with a confounding seriousness,\r\n\r\n“I know at least that you will pray for my soul.”\r\n\r\n“You had better pray for mine, if I have one,” answered Joan, “but why\r\nnow?”\r\n\r\n“Because,” said Patrick, “you will hear from outside, you may even see\r\nfrom that turret window something which in brute fact has never been\r\nseen in England since Poor Monmouth’s army went down. In spirit and in\r\ntruth it has not happened since Saladin and Cœur de Lion crashed\r\ntogether. I only add one thing, and that you know already. I have lived\r\nloving you and I shall die loving you. It is the only dimension of the\r\nUniverse in which I have not wandered and gone astray. I leave the dog\r\nto guard you;” and he disappeared down the old broken staircase.\r\n\r\nLady Enid was much mystified that no popular pursuit assailed this stair\r\nor invaded the house. But Lady Joan knew better. She had gone, on the\r\nsuggestion she most cared about, into the turret room and looked out of\r\nits many windows on to the abandoned copse and tunnel, which were now\r\nfenced off with high walls, the boundary of the mysterious property next\r\ndoor. Across that high barrier she could not even see the tunnel, and\r\nbarely the tops of the tallest trees which hid its entrance from sight.\r\nBut in an instant she knew that Dalroy was not hurling his forces on\r\nIvywood at all, but on the house and estate beyond it.\r\n\r\nAnd then followed a sight that was not an experience but rather a\r\nrevolving vision. She could never describe it afterward, nor could any\r\nof those involved in so violent and mystical a wheel. She had seen a\r\nhuge wall of a breaker wash all over the parade at Pebblewick; and\r\nwondered that so huge a hammer could be made merely of water. She had\r\nnever had a notion of what it is like when it is made of men.\r\n\r\nThe palisade, put up by the new landlord in front of the old tangled\r\nground by the tunnel, she had long regarded as something as settled and\r\nordinary as one of the walls of the drawing room. It swung and split and\r\nsprang into a thousand pieces under the mere blow of human bodies\r\nbursting with rage; and the great wave crested the obstacle more clearly\r\nthan she had ever seen any great wave crest the parade. Only, when the\r\nfence was broken, she saw behind it something that robbed her of reason;\r\nso that she seemed to be living in all ages and all lands at once. She\r\nnever could describe the vision afterward; but she always denied it was\r\na dream. She said it was worse; it was something more real than reality.\r\nIt was a line of real soldiers, which is always a magnificent sight. But\r\nthey might have been the soldiers of Hannibal or of Attila, they might\r\nhave been dug up from the cemeteries of Sidon and Babylon, for all Joan\r\nhad to do with them. There, encamped in English meadows, with a\r\nhawthorn-tree in front of them and three beeches behind, was something\r\nthat has never been in camp nearer than some leagues south of Paris,\r\nsince that Carolus called The Hammer broke it backward at Tours.\r\n\r\nThere flew the green standard of that great faith and strong\r\ncivilization which has so often almost entered the great cities of the\r\nWest; which long encircled Vienna, which was barely barred from Paris;\r\nbut which had never before been seen in arms on the soil of England. At\r\none end of the line stood Phillip Ivywood, in a uniform of his own\r\nspecial creation, a compromise between the Sepoy and the Turkish\r\nuniform. The compromise worked more and more wildly in Joan’s mind. If\r\nany impression remained it was merely that England had conquered India\r\nand Turkey had conquered England. Then she saw that Ivywood, for all his\r\nuniform, was not the Commander of these forces, for an old man, with a\r\ngreat scar on his face, which was not a European face, set himself in\r\nthe front of the battle, as if it had been a battle in the old epics,\r\nand crossed swords with Patrick Dalroy. He had come to return the scar\r\nupon his forehead; and he returned it with many wounds, though at last\r\nit was he who sank under the sword thrust. He fell on his face; and\r\nDalroy looked at him with something that is much more great than pity.\r\nBlood was flowing from Patrick’s wrist and forehead, but he made a\r\nsalute with his sword. As he was doing so, the corpse, as it appeared,\r\nlaboriously lifted a face, with feeble eyelids. And, seeming to\r\nunderstand the quarters of the sky by instinct, Oman Pasha dragged\r\nhimself a foot or so to the left; and fell with his face toward Mecca.\r\n\r\nAfter that the turret turned round and round about Joan and she knew not\r\nwhether the things she saw were history or prophecy. Something in that\r\nlast fact of being crushed by the weapons of brown men and yellow,\r\nsecretly entrenched in English meadows, had made the English what they\r\nhad not been for centuries. The hawthorn-tree was twisted and broken, as\r\nit was at the Battle of Ashdown, when Alfred led his first charge\r\nagainst the Danes. The beech-trees were splashed up to their lowest\r\nbranches with the mingling of brave heathen and brave Christian blood.\r\nShe knew no more than that when a column of the Christian rebels, led by\r\nHumphrey of the Sign of the Ship, burst through the choked and forgotten\r\ntunnel and took the Turkish regiment in the rear, it was the end.\r\n\r\nThat violent and revolving vision became something beyond the human\r\nvoice or human ear. She could not intelligently hear even the shots and\r\nshouts round the last magnificent rally of the Turks. It was natural,\r\ntherefore, that she should not hear the words Lord Ivywood addressed to\r\nhis next-door neighbour, a Turkish officer, or rather to himself. But\r\nhis words were:\r\n\r\n“I have gone where God has never dared to go. I am above the silly\r\nsupermen as they are above mere men. Where I walk in the Heavens, no man\r\nhas walked before me; and I am alone in a garden. All this passing about\r\nme is like the lonely plucking of garden flowers. I will have this\r\nblossom, I will have that.”\r\n\r\nThe sentence ended so suddenly that the officer looked at him, as if\r\nexpecting him to speak. But he did not speak.\r\n\r\nBut Patrick and Joan, wandering together in a world made warm and fresh\r\nagain, as it can be for few in a world that calls courage frenzy and\r\nlove superstition, feeling every branching tree as a friend with arms\r\nopen for the man, or every sweeping slope as a great train trailing\r\nbehind the woman, did one day climb up to the little white cottage that\r\nwas now the home of the Superman.\r\n\r\nHe sat playing with a pale, reposeful face, with scraps of flower and\r\nweed put before him on a wooden table. He did not notice them, nor\r\nanything else around him; scarcely even Enid Wimpole, who attended to\r\nall his wants.\r\n\r\n“He is perfectly happy,” she said quietly.\r\n\r\nJoan, with the glow on her dark face, could not prevent herself from\r\nreplying, “And we are so happy.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Enid, “but his happiness will last,” and she wept.\r\n\r\n“I understand,” said Joan, and kissed her cousin, not without tears of\r\nher own.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ● Transcriber’s Notes:\r\n    ○ Missing or obscured punctuation was silently corrected.\r\n    ○ Typographical errors were silently corrected.\r\n    ○ The notation “H_{2}O” uses the underscore and braces to mean a\r\n      subscripted\r\n\r\n      character.
