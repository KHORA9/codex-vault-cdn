LECKY,\r\n\r\n\r\nI DEDICATE ALL IN THIS BOOK\r\nTHAT IS WORTHY OF THE FRIENDSHIP\r\nWITH WHICH HE HONOURED ME,\r\nAND OF THE COUNSEL WHICH HE GAVE ME\r\nFOR MY GUIDANCE IN IRISH PUBLIC LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nThose who have known Ireland for the last dozen years cannot have failed\r\nto notice the advent of a wholly new spirit, clearly based upon\r\nconstructive thought, and expressing itself in a wide range of fresh\r\npractical activities. The movement for the organisation of agriculture\r\nand rural credit on co-operative lines, efforts of various kinds to\r\nrevive old or initiate new industries, and, lastly, the creation of a\r\ndepartment of Government to foster all that was healthy in the voluntary\r\neffort of the people to build up the economic side of their life, are\r\neach interesting in themselves. When taken together, and in conjunction\r\nwith the literary and artistic movements, and viewed in their relation\r\nto history, politics, religion, education, and the other past and\r\npresent influences operating upon the Irish mind and character, these\r\nmovements appear to me to be worthy of the most thoughtful consideration\r\nby all who are responsible for, or desire the well-being of the Irish\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nI should not, however, in days when my whole time and energies belong to\r\nthe public service, have undertaken the task of writing a book on a\r\nsubject so complex and apparently so inseparable from heated\r\ncontroversy, were I not convinced that the expression of certain\r\nthoughts which have come to me from practical contact with Irish\r\nproblems, was the best contribution I could make to the work on which I\r\nwas engaged. I wished, if I could, to bring into clearer light the\r\nessential unity of the various progressive movements in Ireland, and to\r\ndo something towards promoting a greater definiteness of aim and method,\r\nand a better understanding of each other's work, among those who are in\r\nvarious ways striving for the upbuilding of a worthy national life in\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nSo far the task, if difficult, was congenial and free from\r\nembarrassment. Unhappily, it had been borne in upon me, in the course of\r\na long study of Irish life, that our failure to rise to our\r\nopportunities and to give practical evidence of the intellectual\r\nqualities with which the race is admittedly gifted, was due to certain\r\ndefects of character, not ethically grave, but economically paralysing.\r\nI need hardly say I refer to the lack of moral courage, initiative,\r\nindependence and self-reliance--defects which, however they may be\r\naccounted for, it is the first duty of modern Ireland to recognise and\r\novercome. I believe in the new movements in Ireland, principally because\r\nthey seem to me to exert a stimulating influence upon our moral fibre.\r\n\r\nHolding such an opinion, I had to decide between preserving a discreet\r\nsilence and speaking my full mind. The former course would, it appeared\r\nto me, be a poor example of the moral courage which I hold to be\r\nIreland's sorest need. Moreover, while I am full of hope for the future\r\nof my country, its present condition does not, in my view, admit of any\r\ndelay in arriving at the truth as to the essential principles which\r\nshould guide all who wish to take a part, however humble, in the work of\r\nnational regeneration.\r\n\r\nI desire to state definitely that I have not written in any\r\nrepresentative capacity except where I say so explicitly. I write on my\r\nown responsibility, with the full knowledge that there is much in the\r\nbook with which many of those with whom I work do not agree.\r\n\r\n_December_,

politics grow on one stem\r\n     in Ireland, an eternal trefoil.\"--_Lady Gregory_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH MISUNDERSTANDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the ultimate verdict of history upon the long struggle\r\nof the majority of the Irish people for self-government, the picture of\r\na small country with large aspirations giving of its best unstintingly\r\nto the world, while gaining for itself little beyond sympathy, will\r\nappeal to the imagination of future ages long after the Irish Question,\r\nas we know it, has been buried. It may then, perhaps, be seen that the\r\naspirations came to nought because they were opposed to the manifest\r\ndestiny of the race, and that it should never have been expected or\r\ndesired that the Dark Rosaleen should 'reign and reign alone.'\r\nNevertheless, the fidelity and fortitude with which the national ideal\r\nhad been pursued would command admiration, even if the ideal itself were\r\nto be altogether abandoned, or if it were to be ultimately realised in a\r\nmanner which showed that the methods by which its attainment had been\r\nsought were the cause of its long postponement. Whatever the future may\r\nhave in store for the remnant of the Irish people at home, the continued\r\npursuit of a separate national existence by a nation which is rapidly\r\ndisappearing from the land of all its hopes, and the cherishing of\r\nthese hopes, not only by those who stay but also by those who go, will\r\nstand as a monument to human constancy.\r\n\r\nThe picture will be all the more remarkable when emphasised by a\r\ncontrast which the historian will not fail to draw. Across a narrow\r\nstreak of sea another people, during the same period, increased and\r\nmultiplied and prospered mightily, spread their laws and institutions,\r\nand achieved in every portion of the globe material success which they\r\ncan call their own. Yet, although Irishmen have done much to win that\r\nsuccess for the English people to enjoy, and are to-day foremost in\r\nmaintaining the great empire which their brain and muscle were ever\r\nready to augment, Ireland makes no claim for herself in respect of the\r\nachievement. It is to her but a proof of what her sons will do for her\r\nin the coming time; it does not bring her nearer to her heart's desire.\r\n\r\nAlthough the nineteenth century, with all its marvellous contributions\r\nto human progress, left Ireland with her hopes unfulfilled; although its\r\nsun went down upon the British people with their greatest failure still\r\nstaring them in the face, its last decade witnessed at first a change in\r\nthe attitude of England towards Ireland, and afterwards a profound\r\nrevolution in the thoughts of Ireland about herself. The strangest and\r\nmost interesting feature of these developments was that in practical\r\nEngland the Irish Question became the great political issue, while in\r\nsentimental Ireland there set in a reaction from politics and an\r\ninclination to the practical. The twentieth century has already brought\r\nto birth the new Ireland upon whose problems I shall write. If the human\r\ninterest of these problems is to be realized, if their significance is\r\nnot to be as wholly misunderstood as that of every other Irish movement\r\nwhich has perplexed the statesmen who have managed our affairs, they\r\nmust be studied in their relation to the English and Irish events of the\r\nperiod in which the new Ireland was conceived.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 Gladstone, appealing to an electorate with a large accession of\r\nnewly enfranchised voters, transferred the struggle over the Irish\r\nQuestion from Ireland to Great Britain. The position taken up by the\r\naverage English Home Ruler was, it will be remembered, simple and\r\nintelligible. The Irish had stated in the proper constitutional way what\r\nthey wanted, and that, in the first flush of a victorious democracy,\r\nwhen counting heads irrespective of contents was the popular method of\r\narriving at political truth, was assumed to be precisely what they ought\r\nto have. A long but inconclusive contest ensued. At times it looked as\r\nif the Liberal-Irish alliance might snatch a victory for their policy.\r\nBut when Gladstone was forced to break with the Irish Leader, and\r\nParnellism without Parnell became obviously impossible, the English\r\nrealised that the working of representative institutions in Ireland had\r\nproduced not a democracy but a dictatorship, and they began to attach a\r\nlesser significance to the verdict of the Irish polls. Their faith in\r\ndemocracy was unimpaired, but, in their opinion, the Irish had not yet\r\nrisen to its dignity. So most English Radicals came round to a view\r\nwhich they had always reprobated when advanced by the English\r\nConservatives, and political inferiority was added to the other moral\r\nand intellectual defects which made the Irish an inferior race!\r\n\r\nThe anti-climax to the Gladstone crusade was reached when Lord Rosebery\r\nin 1894 took over the premiership from the greatest English advocate of\r\nthe Irish cause. The position of the new leader was very simple. In\r\neffect, he told the Irish Nationalists that the English party he was\r\nabout to lead had done its best for them. They must now regard\r\nthemselves as partners in the United Kingdom, with the British as the\r\npredominant partner. Until the predominant partner could be brought to\r\ntake the Irish view of the partnership, the relations between them must\r\nremain substantially as they were. And not only must the concession of\r\nHome Rule await the conversion of the British electorate, but before the\r\ndemand could be effectively preferred, another leader must rise up among\r\nthe Irish; and he, for all Lord Rosebery knew, was at the moment being\r\nwheeled in a perambulator. This apparently cynical avowal of the new\r\npremier's own attitude towards Home Rule accurately stated the facts of\r\nthe situation, and fairly reflected the mind of the British electorate,\r\nafter Irish obstruction had given them an opportunity of studying the\r\nbearing of the Irish Question on English politics.\r\n\r\nIf the logic of events was thus making for the removal of Home Rule from\r\nthe region of practical politics in England, an even more momentous\r\nchange was taking place in Ireland. Whilst the Home Rule controversy was\r\nat its height in the 'eighties and early 'nineties, some Irish\r\ngrievances were incidentally dealt with--not always under the best\r\nimpulses or in the best way. The concentration of all the available\r\nthought and energy of Irish public men upon an appeal to the passions\r\nand prejudices of English parties had led to the further postponement of\r\nall Irish endeavour to deal rationally and practically with her own\r\nproblems at home. But during the welter of contention which prevailed\r\nafter the fall of Parnell, there grew up in Ireland a wholly new spirit,\r\nborn of the bitter lesson which was at last being learned. The Irish\r\nstill clung undaunted to their political ideal, but its pursuit to the\r\nexclusion of all other national aims had received a wholesome check.\r\nThought upon the problems of national progress broadened and deepened,\r\nin a manner little understood by those who knew Ireland from without,\r\nand, indeed, by many of those accounted wise among the observers from\r\nwithin. Was the realisation of a distinctive national existence, many\r\nbegan to ask themselves, to be for ever dependent upon the fortunes of a\r\npolitical campaign? In any scheme of a reconstructed national life to\r\nwhich the Irish would give of their best, there must be\r\ndistinctiveness--that much every man who is in touch with Irish life is\r\nfully aware of--but the question of existence must not be altogether\r\nignored. At the rate the people were leaving the sinking ship, the Irish\r\nQuestion would be settled in the not distant future by the disappearance\r\nof the Irish. Had we not better look around and see how other countries\r\nwith more or less analogous conditions fared? Could we not--Unionists\r\nand Nationalists alike--do something towards material progress without\r\nabandoning our ideals? Could we not learn something from a study of what\r\nour people were doing abroad? One seemed to hear the voice of Bishop\r\nBerkeley, the biting pertinence of whose _Queries_ is ever fresh, asking\r\nfrom the grave in which he had been laid to rest nearly a century and a\r\nhalf ago 'whether it would not be more reasonable to mend our state than\r\ncomplain of it; and how far this may be in our own power?'\r\n\r\nThese questionings, though not generally heard on the platform or even\r\nin the street, were none the less working in the depths of the Irish\r\nmind, and found expression not so much in words as in deeds. Yet though\r\nthe downfall of Parnell released many minds from the obsession of\r\npolitics, the influence of that event was of a negative character, and\r\nit took time to produce a beneficial effect. That fruitful last decade\r\nof the nineteenth century saw the foundation of what will some day be\r\nrecognised as a new philosophy of Irish progress. Certain new principles\r\nwere then promulgated in Ireland, and gradually found acceptance; and\r\nupon those principles a new movement was built. It is partly, indeed, to\r\nexpound and justify some, at any rate, of the principles and to give an\r\nintelligible account of the practical achievement and future\r\npossibilities of this movement that I write these pages.\r\n\r\nFor English readers, to whom this introductory chapter is chiefly\r\naddressed, I may here reiterate the opinion, which I have always held\r\nand often expressed, that there is no real conflict of interest between\r\nthe two peoples and the two countries, and that the mutual\r\nmisunderstanding which we may now hope to see removed is due to a wide\r\ndifference of temperament and mental outlook. The English mind has never\r\nunderstood the Irish mind--least of all during the period of the 'Union\r\nof Hearts.' It is equally true that the Irish have largely misunderstood\r\nboth the English character and their own responsibility. The result has\r\nbeen that their leaders, despite the brilliant capacity they have shown\r\nin presenting the unhappy case of their country to the rest of the\r\nworld, have rarely presented it in the right way to the English people.\r\nThere have been many occasions during the last quarter of a century when\r\na calm, well-reasoned statement of the economic disadvantages under\r\nwhich Ireland labours would, I am convinced, have successfully appealed\r\nto British public opinion. It could have been shown that the development\r\nof Ireland--the development not only of the resources of her soil but of\r\nthe far greater wealth which lies in the latent capacities of her\r\npeople--was demanded quite as much in the interest of one country as in\r\nthat of the other.\r\n\r\nHere, indeed, is an untilled field for those to whom the Irish Question\r\nis yet a living one. If I could think that each country fully realised\r\nits own responsibility in the matter, if I could think that the\r\nlong-continued misunderstanding was at an end, nothing would induce me\r\nto trouble the waters at this auspicious hour, when a better feeling\r\ntowards Ireland prevails in Great Britain, and when the Irish people are\r\nfully appreciative of the obviously sincere desire of England to be\r\ngenerous to Ireland. But an examination of the events upon which the\r\nprevailing optimism is based will show that, unhappily,\r\nmisunderstanding, though of another sort, still exists, and that Ireland\r\nis as much as ever a riddle to the English mind.\r\n\r\nNow this new optimism in the English view of Ireland seems to be based,\r\nnot upon a recognition of the development of what I have ventured to\r\ndignify with the title of a new philosophy of Irish progress, but upon a\r\nbelief that the spirit of moderation and conciliation displayed by so\r\nmany Irishmen in connection with the Land Act is due to the fact that my\r\nincomprehensible countrymen have, under a sudden emotion, put away\r\nchildish things and learned to behave like grown-up Englishmen.\r\nThroughout the press comments upon the Dunraven Conference and in public\r\nspeeches both inside and outside Parliament there has run a sense that a\r\nsort of portent, a transformation scene, a sudden and magical\r\nalteration in the whole spirit and outlook of the Irish people, has come\r\nto pass.\r\n\r\nI feel some hesitation in asking the reader to believe that a great and\r\nlasting revolution in Irish thought has been brought about in such a\r\nmoment in the life of a people as twelve short years. But a lesser\r\nnumber of months seemed to the English mind adequate for the\r\naccomplishment of the change. And what a change it was that they\r\nconceived! To them, less than a year ago, the Irish Question was not\r\nmerely unsolved, but in its essential features appeared unaltered. After\r\nseven centuries of experimental statecraft--so varied that the English\r\ncould not believe any expedient had yet to be tried--the vast majority\r\nof the Irish people regarded the Government as alien, disputed the\r\nvalidity of its laws, and felt no responsibility for administration, no\r\nrespect for the legislature, or for those who executed its decrees. And\r\nthis in a country forming an integral part of the United Kingdom, where\r\nthe fundamental basis of government is assumed to be the consent of the\r\ngoverned! Nor were any hopes entertained that the cloud would quickly\r\npass. During the Boer war the prophets of evil, in predicting the\r\ncalamity which was to fall upon the British Empire, took as their text\r\nthe failure of English government in Ireland. When they wanted to paint\r\nin the darkest colours the coming heritage of woe, they wrote upon the\r\nwall, 'Another Ireland in South Africa'; and if any exception was taken\r\nto the appropriateness of the phrase, it was certainly not on the\r\nground that Ireland had ceased to be a warning to British statesmen.\r\n\r\nI believe, quite as strongly as the most optimistic Englishman, that\r\nthere has been a great change from this state of things in Irish\r\nsentiment, and my explanation of that change, if less dramatic than the\r\ntransformation theory, affords more solid ground for optimism. This\r\nchange in the sentiment of Irishmen towards England is due, not to a\r\nsudden emotion of the incomprehensible Celt, but really to the\r\nopinion--rapidly growing for the last dozen years--that great as is the\r\nresponsibility of England for the state of Ireland, still greater is the\r\nresponsibility of Irishmen. The conviction has been more and more borne\r\nin upon the Irish mind that the most important part of the work of\r\nregenerating Ireland must necessarily be done by Irishmen in Ireland.\r\nThe result has been that many Irishmen, both Unionists and Nationalists,\r\nwithout in any way abandoning their opposition to, or support of, the\r\nattempt to solve the political problem from without, have been\r\ntrying--not without success--to solve some part of the Irish Question\r\nfrom within. The Report of the Recess Committee, on which I shall dwell\r\nlater, was the first great fruit of this movement, and the Dunraven\r\nTreaty, which paved the way for Mr. Wyndham's Land Act, was a further\r\nfruit, and not the result of an inexplicable transformation scene.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I dwell on the true nature of the undoubted change in\r\nthe Irish situation is not in order to exaggerate the importance of the\r\npart played by the new movement in bringing it about, nor to detract\r\nfrom the importance of Parliamentary action, but because a mistaken view\r\nof the change would inevitably postpone the firm establishment of an\r\nimproved mutual understanding between the two countries, which I regard\r\nas an essential of Irish progress. I confess that my apprehension of a\r\nnew misunderstanding was aroused by the debates on the Land Bill in the\r\nHouse of Commons. As regards the spirit of conciliation and moderation\r\ndisplayed by the Irish, and the sincere desire exhibited by the British\r\nto heal the chief Irish economic sore, the speeches were, if not\r\nepoch-making, at any rate epoch-marking; but they showed little sense of\r\nperspective or proportion in viewing the Irish Question, and little\r\ngrasp or appreciation of the large social and economic problems which\r\nthe Land Act will bring to the front. Temporary phenomena and\r\nlegislative machinery have been endowed with an importance they do not\r\npossess, and miracles, it is supposed, are about to be worked in Ireland\r\nby processes which, whatever rich good may be in them, have never worked\r\nmiracles, though they have not seldom excited very similar enthusiasms\r\nin the economic history of other European lands.\r\n\r\nI agree, then, with most Englishmen in thinking, though for a different\r\nreason, that the passing of the Land Act marked a new era in Ireland.\r\nThey regard it as productive of, or co-incident in time with, the dawn\r\nof the practical in Ireland. I antedate that event by some dozen years,\r\nand regard the Land Act rather as marking a new era, because it removes\r\nthe great obstacle which obscured the dawn of the practical for so many,\r\nand hindered it for all.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the expectations upon which this great measure\r\nwas based, I, in common with most Irish observers, watched its progress\r\nwith unfeigned delight. The vast majority regarded the hundred millions\r\nof credit and the twelve millions of 'bonus' as a generous concession to\r\nIreland; and I sympathised with those who deprecated the mischievous\r\nsuggestion, not infrequently heard in English political circles, that\r\nthis munificence was the 'price of peace.' On one point all were agreed:\r\nthe Bill could never have become law had not Mr. Wyndham handled the\r\nParliamentary situation with masterly tact, temper, and ability. To him\r\nis chiefly due the credit for the fact that the Land Question, in its\r\nold form at any rate, no longer blocks the way, and that the large\r\nproblems which remain to be solved, and, above all, the spirit in which\r\nthey will have to be approached by those who wish the existing peace to\r\nbe the forerunner of material and social progress, can be freely and\r\nfrankly discussed.\r\n\r\nIt is true, as I have said, that Ireland is becoming more and more\r\npractical, and that England is becoming more anxious than ever to do her\r\nsubstantial justice. But still the manner of the doing will continue to\r\nbe as important as the thing which is done. Of the Irish qualities none\r\nis stronger than the craving to be understood. If the English had only\r\nknown this secret we should have been the most easily governed people in\r\nthe world. For it is characteristic of the conduct of our most important\r\naffairs that we care too little about the substance and too much about\r\nthe shadow. It is for this reason that I have discussed the real nature\r\nof one phase of Irish sentiment which has been largely misunderstood,\r\nand it is for the same reason that I propose to preface my examination\r\nof the Irish Question with some reference to the cause and nature of the\r\nanti-English sentiment, for the long continuance of which I can find no\r\nother explanation than the failure of the English to see into the Irish\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nI am well acquainted with this sentiment because, in my practical work\r\nin Ireland, it has ever been the main current of the stream against\r\nwhich I have had to swim. Years spent in the United States had made me\r\nfamiliar with its full and true significance, for there it can be\r\nstudied in an atmosphere not dominated by any present Irish\r\ncontroversies or struggles. I have found this sentiment of hatred deeply\r\nrooted in the minds of Irishmen who had themselves never known Ireland,\r\nwho had no connection, other than a sentimental one, with that country,\r\nwho were living quiet business lives in the United States, but who were\r\never ready to testify with their dollars, and genuinely believed that\r\nthey only lacked opportunity to demonstrate in a more enterprising way,\r\ntheir \"undying hatred of the English name.\"[1]\r\n\r\nWith such men I have reasoned, and sometimes not in vain, upon the\r\ninjustice and unreason of their attitude. I have not attempted to\r\ncontrovert the main facts of Ireland's grievances, which they frequently\r\ntold me they had gleaned from Froude and Lecky. I used to deprecate the\r\nunqualified application of modern standards to the policies of other\r\ndays, and to protest against the injustice of punishing one set of\r\npersons for the misdoings of another set of persons, who have long since\r\npassed beyond the reach of any earthly tribunal. I have given them my\r\nreasons for believing that, even if such a course were morally\r\nadmissible, the wit of man could not devise any means of inflicting a\r\nblow upon England which would not react injuriously with tenfold force\r\nupon Ireland. I have gone on to show that the sentiment itself, largely\r\nthe accident of untoward circumstances, is alien to the character and\r\ntemperament of the Irish people. In short, I have urged that the policy\r\nof revenge is un-Christian and unintelligent, and, that, as the Irish\r\npeople are neither irreligious nor stupid, it is un-Irish. I well\r\nremember taking up this position in conversation with some very advanced\r\nIrish-Americans in the Far West and the reply which one of them made.\r\n\"Wal,\" said my half-persuaded friend, \"mebbe you're right. I have two\r\nsons, whom I have raised in the expectation that they will one day\r\nstrike a blow for old Ireland. Mebbe they won't. I'm too old to change.\"\r\n\r\nI have chosen this incident from a long series of similar reminiscences\r\nof my study of Irish life, to illustrate an attitude of mind, the\r\nhistorical explanation of which would seem to the practical Englishman\r\nas academic as a psychological exposition of the effect of a red rag\r\nupon a bull. The English are not much to be blamed for resenting the\r\nsurvival of the feeling, but it appears to me to argue a singular lack\r\nof political imagination that they should still fail to appreciate the\r\nreality, the significance, and the abiding force of a sentiment which\r\nhas so far successfully resisted the influence of those governing\r\nqualities which have played a foremost part in the civilisation of the\r\nmodern world. The _Spectator_ some time ago came out bluntly with a\r\ntruth which an Irishman may, I presume, quote without offence from so\r\nhigh an English authority:--\"The one blunder of average Englishmen in\r\nconsidering foreign questions is that with white men they make too\r\nlittle allowance for sentiment, and with coloured men they make none at\r\nall.\"[2] I am afraid it must be added that 'average Englishmen' make\r\nexactly the same blunder in under-estimating the force of sentiment when\r\nconsidering Irish questions, with the not unnatural consequence that\r\nthe Irish regard them as foreigners, and that, as those foreigners\r\nhappen to govern them, the sentiment of nationality becomes political\r\nand anti-English.\r\n\r\nThere is one reason why this sentiment is not allowed to die which\r\nshould always be remembered by those who wish to grasp the inner\r\nworkings of the Irish mind. Briefly stated, the view prevails in Ireland\r\nthat in dealing with questions affecting our material well-being, the\r\ngovernment of our country by the English was, in the past, characterised\r\nby an unenlightened self-interest. Thoughtful Englishmen admit this\r\ncharge, but they say that the past referred to is beyond living memory\r\nand should now be buried. The Irish mind replies that the life of a\r\nnation is not to be measured by the life of individuals, and that a\r\nwrong inflicted by a Government upon a community entitles those who\r\ninherit the consequences of the injury to claim reparation at the hands\r\nof those who inherit the government. With this attitude on the part of\r\nthe Irish mind I am not only most heartily in sympathy, but I find every\r\nEnglishman who understands the situation equally so. In the later\r\nportions of this book it will be shown that practical recognition, in no\r\nsmall measure, has been given by England to the righteousness of this\r\npart of the Irish case, and that if the effect thus produced has not\r\nfound as full an outward expression as might have been expected, the\r\nIrish people have at any rate responded to the new treatment in a manner\r\nwhich must, in no distant future, bring about a better understanding.\r\n\r\nThe only historical causes of our present discontents to which I need\r\nnow particularly refer, are the commercial restrictions and the land\r\nsystem of the past, which stand out from the long list of Irish\r\ngrievances as those for which their victims were the least responsible.\r\nNo one can be more anxious than I am that we should cease to be for ever\r\nseeking in the past excuses for our present failures. But it is\r\nessential to a correct estimation of Irish agricultural and industrial\r\npossibilities that we should notice the true bearings of these\r\nhistorical grievances upon existing conditions.\r\n\r\nIn this connection there arises a question which is very pertinent to\r\nthe present inquiry and which must therefore be considered. I have seen\r\nit argued by English economists that the industrial revolution which\r\ntook place at the end of the eighteenth and commencement of the\r\nnineteenth century would in any case have destroyed, by force of open\r\ncompetition, industries which, it is admitted, were previously\r\nlegislated away. They point out that the change from the order of small\r\nscattered home industries to the factory system would have suited\r\nneither the temperament nor the industrial habits of the Irish. They\r\ntell us that with the industrial revolution the juxtaposition of coal\r\nand iron became an all-important factor in the problem, and they recall\r\nhow the north and west of England captured the industrial supremacy from\r\nthe south and east. Incidentally they point out that the people of the\r\nEnglish counties which suffered by these economic causes braced\r\nthemselves to meet the changes, and it is suggested that if the people\r\nof Ireland had shown the same resourcefulness, they, too, might have\r\nweathered the storm. And, finally, we are reminded that England, by her\r\nstupid Irish policy, punished her own supporters, and even herself,\r\nquite as much as the 'mere Irish.'\r\n\r\nMuch of this may be true, but this line of argument only shows that\r\nthese English economists do not thoroughly understand the real grievance\r\nwhich the Irish people still harbour against the English for past\r\nmisgovernment. The commercial restraints sapped the industrial instinct\r\nof the people--an evil which was intensified in the case of the\r\nCatholics by the working of the penal laws. When these legislative\r\nrestrictions upon industry had been removed, the Irish, not being\r\ntrained in industrial habits, were unable to adapt themselves to the\r\naltered conditions produced by the Industrial Revolution, as did the\r\npeople in England. And as for commerce, the restrictions, which had as\r\nlittle moral sanction as the penal laws, and which invested smuggling\r\nwith a halo of patriotism, had prevented the development of commercial\r\nmorality, without which there can be no commercial success. It is not,\r\ntherefore, the destruction of specific industries, or even the sweeping\r\nof our commerce from the seas, about which most complaint is now made.\r\nThe real grievance lies in the fact that something had been taken from\r\nour industrial character which could not be remedied by the mere removal\r\nof the restrictions. Not only had the tree been stripped, but the roots\r\nhad been destroyed. If ever there was a case where President Kruger's\r\n'moral and intellectual damages' might fairly be claimed by an injured\r\nnation, it is to be found in the industrial and commercial history of\r\nIreland during the period of the building up of England's commercial\r\nsupremacy.\r\n\r\nThe English mind quite failed, until the very end of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, to grasp the real needs of the situation which had thus been\r\ncreated in Ireland The industrial revolution, as I have indicated, found\r\nthe Irish people fettered by an industrial past for which they\r\nthemselves were not chiefly responsible. They needed exceptional\r\ntreatment of a kind which was not conceded. They were, instead, still\r\nfurther handicapped, towards the middle of the century, by the adoption\r\nof Free Trade, which was imposed upon them when they were not only\r\nunable to take advantage of its benefits, but were so situated as to\r\nsuffer to the utmost from its inconveniences.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that the long-continued misunderstanding of the\r\nconditions and needs of this country, the withholding, for so long, of\r\nnecessary concessions, was due not to heartlessness or contempt so much\r\nas to a lack of imagination, a defect for which the English cannot be\r\nblamed. They had, to use a modern term, 'standardised' their qualities,\r\nand it was impossible to get out of their minds the belief that a\r\ndivergence, in another race, from their standard of character was\r\nsynonymous with inferiority. This attitude is not yet a thing of the\r\npast, but it is fast disappearing; and thoughtful Englishmen now\r\nrecognise the righteousness of the claim for reparation, and are willing\r\nliberally to apply any stimulus to our industrial life which may place\r\nus, so far as this is possible, on the level we might have occupied had\r\nwe been left to work out our own economic salvation. Unfortunately, all\r\nEnglishmen are not thoughtful, and hence I emphasise the fact that\r\nEngland is largely responsible for our industrial defects, and must not\r\nhesitate to face the financial results of that responsibility.\r\n\r\nWhen we pass from the domain of commerce, where we have seen that\r\ncircumstances reduced to the minimum Ireland's participation in the\r\nindustrial supremacy of England, and come to examine the historical\r\ndevelopment of Irish agrarian life, we find a situation closely related\r\nto, and indeed, largely created by, that which we have been discussing.\r\n'Debarred from every other trade and industry,' wrote the late Lord\r\nDufferin, 'the entire nation flung itself back upon the land, with as\r\nfatal an impulse as when a river, whose current is suddenly impeded,\r\nrolls back and drowns the valley which it once fertilised.' The\r\nenergies, the hopes, nay, the very existence of the race, became thus\r\nintimately bound up with agriculture. This industry, their last resort\r\nand sole dependence, had to be conducted by a people who in every other\r\navocation had been unfitted for material success. And this industry,\r\ntoo, was crippled from without, for a system of land tenure had been\r\nimposed upon Ireland that was probably the most effective that could\r\nhave been devised for the purpose of perpetuating and accentuating every\r\ndisability to which other causes had given rise.\r\n\r\nThe Irish land system suffered from the same ills as we all know the\r\npolitical institutions to have suffered from--a partial and intermittent\r\nconquest. Land holding in Ireland remained largely based on the tribal\r\nsystem of open fields and common tillage for nearly eight hundred years\r\nafter collective ownership had begun to pass away in England. The sudden\r\nimposition upon the Irish, early in the seventeenth century, of a land\r\nsystem which was no part of the natural development of the country,\r\nignored, though it could not destroy, the old feeling of communistic\r\nownership, and, when this vanished, it did not vanish as it did in\r\ncountries where more normal conditions prevailed. It did not perish like\r\na piece of outworn tissue pushed off by a new growth from within: on the\r\ncontrary, it was arbitrarily cut away while yet fresh and vital, with\r\nthe result that where a bud should have been there was a scar.\r\n\r\nThis sudden change in the system of land-holding was followed by a\r\ncentury of reprisals and confiscations, and what war began the law\r\ncontinued. The Celtic race, for the most part impoverished in mind and\r\nestate by the penal laws, became rooted to the soil, for, as we have\r\nseen, they had, on account of the repression of industries, no\r\nalternative occupation, and so became, in fact, if not in law,\r\n_adscripti glebae_. Upon the productiveness of their labour the\r\nlandlord depended for his revenues, but he did little to develop that\r\nproductiveness, and the system which was introduced did everything to\r\nlessen it.[3] The wound produced by the original confiscation of the\r\nland was kept from healing by the way in which the tenants' improvements\r\nwere somewhat similarly treated. I do not mean that they were\r\nsystematically confiscated--the Devon and Bessborough Commissions, as\r\nwell as Gladstone, bore witness to the contrary--but the right and the\r\noccasional exercise of the right to confiscate operated in the same way.\r\nIn the Irish tenant's mind dispossession was nine-tenths of the law.\r\n\r\nAn enlightened system of land tenure might have made prosperity and\r\ncontentment the lot of the native race, and, perhaps, have rendered\r\npossible such a solution of the Irish problem as was effected between\r\nEngland and Scotland two centuries ago. What was chiefly required for\r\nagrarian peace was a recognition of that sense of partnership in the\r\nland--a relic of the tribal days--to which the Irish mind tenaciously\r\nadhered. But, like most English concessions, it was not granted until\r\ntoo late, and then granted in the wrong way. The natural result was\r\nthat, when at last the recognition of partnership was enacted, it became\r\na lever for a demand for complete ownership. But this was the aftermath,\r\nfor in the meantime, from the seed sown by English blundering,\r\nIreland--native population and English garrison alike--had reaped the\r\nawful harvest of the Irish famine, which was followed by a long dark\r\nwinter of discontent. Upon the England that sowed the wind there was\r\nvisited a whirlwind of hostility from the Irish race scattered\r\nthroughout the globe.\r\n\r\nIt would be altogether outside the scope or purpose of this chapter to\r\npresent a complete history of the remedial legislation applied to Irish\r\nland tenure. That history, however, illustrates so vividly the English\r\nmisunderstanding, that a short survey of one phase of it may help to\r\npoint the moral. The English intellect at long last began to grasp the\r\nagrarian, though not the industrial side of the wrong that had been done\r\nto Ireland, and the English conscience was moved; there came the era of\r\nconcessions to which I have alluded, and for over a quarter of a century\r\nattempts, often generous, if not very discriminating, were made to deal\r\nwith the situation. In 1870, dispossession was made very costly to the\r\nlandlord. In 1881, it became impossible, except on the tenant's default,\r\nand the partnership was fully recognised, the tenant's share being made\r\nhis own to sell, and being preserved for his profitable use by a right\r\nto have the rent payable to his sleeping partner, the landlord, fixed by\r\na judicial tribunal. These rights were the famous three F's--fixity of\r\ntenure, free sale, and fair rent--of the Magna Charta of the Irish\r\npeasant. If these concessions had only been made in time, they would\r\nprobably have led to a strengthening of the economic position and\r\ncharacter of the Irish tenantry, which would have enabled them to take\r\nfull advantage of their new status, and meet any condition which might\r\narise; and it is just possible that the system might have worked well,\r\neven at the eleventh hour, had it been launched on a rising market.\r\nUnhappily, it fell upon evil days. The prosperous times of Irish\r\nagriculture, which culminated a few years before the passing of the\r\n'Tenants' Charter,' were followed by a serious reaction, the result of\r\ncauses which, though long operative, were only then beginning to make\r\nthemselves felt, and some of which, though the fact was not then\r\ngenerally recognised, were destined to be of no temporary character. The\r\nagricultural depression which has continued ever since was due, as is\r\nnow well known, to foreign competition, or, in other words, to the\r\nopening up of vast areas in the Far West to the plough and herd, and the\r\nbringing of the products of distant countries into the home markets in\r\never-increasing quantity, in ever fresher condition, and at an\r\never-decreasing cost of transportation. Great changes were taking place\r\nin the market which the Irish farmer supplied, and no two men could\r\nagree as to the relative influence of the new factors of the problem, or\r\nas to their probable duration.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said in disparagement of the great experiment commenced\r\nin 1881, there can be no doubt that it enormously improved the legal\r\nposition of the Irish tenantry, and I, for one, regard it as a\r\nnecessary contribution to the events whose logic was finally to bring\r\nabout the abolition of dual ownership. But what a curious instance of\r\nthe irony of fate is afforded by this genuine attempt to heal an Irish\r\nsore, what a commentary it is upon the English misunderstanding of the\r\nIrish mind! Mr. Gladstone found the land system intolerable to one\r\nparty; he made it intolerable to the other also. For half a century\r\n_laissez-faire_ was pedantically applied to Irish agriculture, then\r\nsuddenly the other extreme was adopted; nothing was left alone, and\r\npolitical economy was sent on its famous planetary excursion.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Gladstone was attempting to settle the land question on the\r\nbasis of dual ownership, the seed of a new kind of single\r\nownership--peasant proprietorship--was sown through the influence of\r\nJohn Bright. The operations of the land purchase clauses in the Church\r\nDisestablishment Act of 1869, and the Land Acts of 1870 and 1881, were\r\nenormously extended by the Land Purchase Acts introduced by the\r\nConservative Party in 1885 and in 1891, and the success which attended\r\nthese Acts accentuated the defects and sealed the fate of dual\r\nownership, which all parties recently united to destroy. In other words,\r\nParliament has been undoing a generation's legislative work upon the\r\nIrish land question.\r\n\r\nThis is all I need say about that stage of the Irish agrarian situation\r\nat which we have now arrived. What I wish my readers to bear in mind is\r\nthat the effect of a bad system of land tenure upon the other aspects of\r\nthe Irish Question reaches much further back than the struggles,\r\nagitations, and reforms in connection with Irish land which this\r\ngeneration has witnessed. The same may be said with regard to the other\r\neconomic grievances. No one can be more anxious than I am to fasten the\r\nmind of my countrymen upon the practical things of to-day, and to wean\r\ntheir sad souls from idle regrets over the sorrows of the past. If I\r\nrevive these dead issues, it is because I have learned that no man can\r\nmove the Irish mind to action unless he can see its point of view, which\r\nis largely retrospective. I cannot ignore the fact that the attitude of\r\nmind which causes the Irish people to put too much faith in legislative\r\ncures for economic ills is mainly due to the belief that their ancestors\r\nwere the victims of a long series of laws by which every industry that\r\nmight have made the country prosperous was jealously repressed or\r\nruthlessly destroyed. Those who are not too much appalled by the\r\nquantity to examine into the quality of popular oratory in Ireland are\r\nfamiliar with the subordination of present economic issues to the dreary\r\nreiteration of this old tale of woe. Personally I have always held that\r\nto foster resentment in respect of these old wrongs is as stupid as was\r\nthe policy which gave them birth; and, even if it were possible to\r\ndistribute the blame among our ancestors, I am sure we should do\r\nourselves much harm, and no living soul any good, in the reckoning. In\r\nmy view, Anglo-Irish history is for Englishmen to remember, for Irishmen\r\nto forget.\r\n\r\nI may now conclude my appeal to outside observers for a broader and more\r\nphilosophic view of my country and my countrymen with a suggestion born\r\nof my own early mistakes, and with a word of warning which is called for\r\nby my later observation of the mistakes of others. The difficulty of the\r\noutside observer in understanding the Irish Question is, no doubt,\r\nlargely due to the fact that those in intimate touch with the actual\r\nconditions are so dominated by vehement and passionate conviction that\r\nreason is not only at a discount but is fatal to the acquisition of\r\npopular influence. Of course the power of knowledge and thought, though\r\nkept in the background, is not really eliminated. But it is in the\r\ncircumstances not unnatural that most of us should fall into the error\r\nof attributing to the influence of prominent individuals or\r\norganisations the events and conditions which the superficial observer\r\nregards as the creation of the hour, but which are in reality the\r\noutcome of a slow and continuous process of evolution. I remember as a\r\nboy being captivated by that charming corrective to this view of\r\nhistorical development, Buckle's _History of Civilization_, which in\r\nrecent years has often recurred to my mind, despite the fact that many\r\nof his theories are now somewhat discredited. Buckle, if I remember\r\nright, almost eliminates the personal factor in the life of nations.\r\nAccording to his theory, it would not have made much difference to\r\nmodern civilisation if Napoleon had happened, as was so near being the\r\ncase, to be born a British instead of a French subject. It would also\r\nhave followed that if O'Connell had limited his activities to his\r\nprofessional work, or if Parnell had chanced to hate Ireland as bitterly\r\nas he hated England, we should have been, politically, very much where\r\nwe are to-day. The student of Irish affairs should, of course, avoid the\r\nextreme views of historical causation; but in the search for the truth\r\nhe will, I think, be well advised to attach less significance to the\r\ninfluence of prominent personality than is the practice of the ordinary\r\nobserver in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe warning I have to offer, I think, will be justified by a reflection\r\nupon the history of the panaceas which we have been offered, and upon\r\nour present state. To those of my British readers who honestly desire to\r\nunderstand the Irish Question, I would say, let them eschew the sweeping\r\ngeneralisations by which Irish intelligence is commonly outraged. I may\r\npass by the explanation which rests upon the cheap attribution of racial\r\ninferiority with the simple reply that our inferior race has much of the\r\nsuperior blood in its veins; yet the Irish problem is just as acute in\r\ndistricts where the English blood predominates as where the people are\r\n'mere Irish.' If this view be disputed, the matter is not worth arguing\r\nabout, because we cannot be born again. But there are three other common\r\nexplanations of the Irish difficulty, any one of which taken by itself\r\nonly leads away from the truth. I refer, I need hardly say, to the\r\nfamiliar assertions that the origin of the evil is political, that it is\r\nreligious, or that it is neither one nor the other, but economic. In\r\nIrish history, no doubt, we may find, under any of these heads, cause\r\nenough for much of our present wrong-goings. But I am profoundly\r\nconvinced that each of the simple explanations to which I have just\r\nalluded--the racial, the political, the religious, the economic--is\r\nbased upon reasoning from imperfect knowledge of the facts of Irish\r\nlife. The cause and cure of Irish ills are not chiefly political,\r\nbroaden or narrow our conception of politics as we will; they are not\r\nchiefly religious, whatever be the effect of Roman Catholic influence\r\nupon the practical side of the people's life; they are not chiefly\r\neconomic, be the actual poverty of the people and the potential wealth\r\nof the country what they may. The Irish Question is a broad and deeply\r\ninteresting human problem which has baffled generation after generation\r\nof a great and virile race, who complacently attribute their incapacity\r\nto master it to Irish perversity, and pass on, leaving it unsolved by\r\nAnglo-Saxons, and therefore insoluble!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] My own experience confirms Mr. Lecky's view of the chief cause of\r\nthis extraordinary feeling. \"It is probable,\" he writes, \"that the true\r\nsource of the savage hatred of England that animates great bodies of\r\nIrishmen on either side of the Atlantic has very little real connection\r\nwith the penal laws, or the rebellion, or the Union. It is far more due\r\nto the great clearances and the vast unaided emigrations that followed\r\nthe famine.\"--_Leaders of Public Opinion in Ireland_, Vol. II., p, 177.\r\n\r\n[2] _Spectator_, 6th September, 1902.\r\n\r\n[3] The title to the greater part of Irish land is based on\r\nconfiscation. This is true of many other countries, but what was\r\nexceptional in the Irish confiscations was that the grantees for the\r\nmost part did not settle on the lands themselves, drive away the\r\ndispossessed, or come to any rational working agreement with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE IRISH QUESTION IN IRELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst attributing the long continued failure of English rule in Ireland\r\nlargely to a misunderstanding of the Irish mind, I have given\r\nEngland--at least modern England--credit for good intentions towards us.\r\nI now come to the case of the misunderstood, and shall from henceforth\r\nbe concerned with the immeasurably greater responsibility of the Irish\r\npeople themselves for their own welfare. The most characteristic, and by\r\nfar the most hopeful feature of the change in the Anglo-Irish situation\r\nwhich took place in the last decade of the nineteenth century, and upon\r\nthe meaning of which I dwelt in the preceding chapter, is the growing\r\nsense amongst us that the English misunderstanding of Ireland is of far\r\nless importance, and perhaps less inexcusable, than our own\r\nmisunderstanding of ourselves.\r\n\r\nWhen I first came into practical touch with the extraordinarily complex\r\nproblems of Irish life, nothing impressed me so much as the universal\r\nbelief among my countrymen that Providence had endowed them with\r\ncapacities of a high order, and their country with resources of\r\nunbounded richness, but that both the capacities and the resources\r\nremained undeveloped owing to the stupidity--or worse--of British rule.\r\nIt was asserted, and generally taken for granted, that the exiles of\r\nErin sprang to the front in every walk of life throughout the world, in\r\nevery country but their own--though I notice that in quite recent times\r\nendeavours have been made to cool the emigration fever by painting the\r\nfortunes of the Irish in America in the darkest colours. To suggest that\r\nthere was any use in trying at home to make the best of things as they\r\nwere was indicative of a leaning towards British rule; and to attempt to\r\ngive practical effect to such a heresy was to draw a red herring across\r\nthe path of true Nationalism.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to account for the long continuance of this attitude of\r\nthe Irish mind towards Irish problems, which seems unworthy of the\r\nnative intelligence of the people. The truth probably is that while we\r\nhave not allowed our intellectual gifts to decay, they have been of\r\nlittle use to us because we have neglected the second part of the old\r\nScholastic rule of life, and have failed to develop the moral qualities\r\nin which we are deficient. Hence we have developed our critical\r\nfaculties, not, unhappily, along constructive lines. We have been\r\nthroughout alive to the muddling of our affairs by the English, and have\r\naccurately gauged the incapacity of our governors to appreciate our\r\nneeds and possibilities. But we recognised their incapacity more readily\r\nthan our own deficiencies, and we estimated the failure of the English\r\nfar more justly than we apportioned the responsibility between our\r\nrulers and ourselves. The sense of the duty and dignity of labour has\r\nbeen lost in the contemplation of circumstances over which it was\r\nassumed that we have no control.\r\n\r\nIt is a peculiarity of destructive criticism that, unlike charity, it\r\ngenerally begins and ends abroad; and those who cultivate the gentle art\r\nare seldom given to morbid introspection. Our prodigious ignorance about\r\nourselves has not been blissful. Mistaking self-assertion for\r\nself-knowledge, we have presented the pathetic spectacle of a people\r\ncasting the blame for their shortcomings on another people, yet bearing\r\nthe consequences themselves. The national habit of living in the past\r\nseems to give us a present without achievement, a future without hope.\r\nThe conclusion was long ago forced upon me that whatever may have been\r\ntrue of the past, the chief responsibility for the remoulding of our\r\nnational life rests now with ourselves, and that in the last analysis\r\nthe problem of Irish ineffectiveness at home is in the main a problem of\r\ncharacter--and of Irish character.\r\n\r\nI am quite aware that such a diagnosis of our mind disease--from which\r\nIreland is, in my belief, slowly but surely recovering--will not pass\r\nunchallenged, but I would ask any reader who dissents from this view to\r\ntake a glance at the picture of our national life as it might unfold\r\nitself to an unprejudiced but sympathetic outsider who came to Ireland\r\nnot on a political tour but with a sincere desire to get at the truth of\r\nthe Irish Question, and to inquire into the conditions about which all\r\nthe controversy continues to rage.\r\n\r\nThis hypothetical traveller would discover that our resources are but\r\nhalf developed, and yet hundreds of thousands of our workers have gone,\r\nand are still going, to produce wealth where it is less urgently needed.\r\nThe remnant of the race who still cling to the old country are not only\r\nnumerically weak, but in many other ways they show the physical and\r\nmoral effects of the drain which emigration has made on the youth,\r\nstrength, and energy of the community. Our four and a quarter millions\r\nof people, mainly agricultural, have, speaking generally, a very low\r\nstandard of comfort, which they like to attribute to some five or six\r\nmillions sterling paid as agricultural rent, and three millions of\r\nalleged over-taxation. They face the situation bravely--and,\r\nincidentally, swell the over-taxation--with the help of the thirteen or\r\nfourteen millions worth of alcoholic stimulants which they annually\r\nconsume. The still larger consumption in Great Britain may seem to lend\r\nat least a respectability to this apparent over-indulgence, but it looks\r\nodd. The people are endowed with intellectual capacities of a high\r\norder. They have literary gifts and an artistic sense. Yet, with a few\r\nbrilliant exceptions, they contribute nothing to invention and create\r\nnothing in literature or in art. One would say that there must be\r\nsomething wrong with the education of the country; and most people\r\ndeclare that it is too literary, though the Census returns show that\r\nthere are still large numbers who escape the tyranny of books. The\r\npeople have an extraordinary belief in political remedies for economic\r\nills; and their political leaders, who are not as a rule themselves\r\nactively engaged in business life, tell the people, pointing to ruined\r\nmills and unused water power, that the country once had diversified\r\nindustries, and that if they were allowed to apply their panacea,\r\nIreland would quickly rebuild her industrial life. If our hypothetical\r\ntraveller were to ask whether there are no other leaders in the country\r\nbesides the eloquent gentlemen who proclaim her helplessness, he would\r\nbe told that among the professional classes, the landlords, and the\r\ncaptains of industry, are to be found as competent popular advisers as\r\nare possessed by any other country of similar economic standing. But\r\nthese men take only a dilettante part in politics, and no value is set\r\non industrial, commercial or professional success in the choice of\r\npublic men. Can it be that to the Irish mind politics are, what Bulwer\r\nLytton declared love to be, \"the business of the idle, and the idleness\r\nof the busy\"?\r\n\r\nThese, though only a few of the strange ironies of Irish life, are so\r\nparadoxical and so anomalous that they are not unnaturally attributed to\r\nthe intrusion of an alien and unfriendly power; and this furnishes the\r\nreason why everything which goes wrong is used to nourish the\r\nanti-English sentiment. At the same time they give emphasis to the\r\ngrowing doubt as to the wisdom of those to whom the Irish Question\r\npresents itself only as a single and simple issue--namely, whether the\r\nlaws which are to put all these things right shall be made at St.\r\nStephen's by the collective wisdom of the United Kingdom, aided by the\r\nvoice of Ireland--which is adequately represented--or whether these laws\r\nshall be made by Irishmen alone in a Parliament in College Green.\r\n\r\nIt is obviously necessary that, in presenting a comprehensive scheme for\r\ndealing with the conditions I have roughly indicated. I should make some\r\nreference to the attitude towards Home Rule of both the Nationalists and\r\nthe Unionists who have joined in work which, whatever be its\r\nirregularity from the standpoint of party discipline as enforced in\r\nIreland, has succeeded in some degree in directing the energies of our\r\ncountrymen to the development of the resources of our country. Many of\r\nmy fellow-workers were Nationalists who, while stoutly adhering to the\r\nprime necessity for constitutional changes, took the broad view, which\r\nwas unpopular among the Irish Party, that much could be done, even under\r\npresent conditions, to build up our national life on its social,\r\nintellectual, and economic sides. The well-known constitutional changes\r\nwhich were advocated in the political party to which they belonged would\r\nthen, they believed, be more effectively demanded by Ireland, and more\r\nreadily conceded by England. Unionists who worked with me were similarly\r\naffected by the changing mental outlook of the country. They, too, had\r\nto break loose from the traditions of an Irish party, for they felt that\r\nthe exclusively political opposition to Home Rule was not less\r\ndemoralising than the exclusively political pursuit of Home Rule. Just\r\nas the Nationalists who joined the movement believed that all progress\r\nmust make for self-government, so my Unionist fellow-workers believed\r\nit would ultimately strengthen the Union. Each view was thoroughly sound\r\nfrom the standpoint of those who held it, and could be regarded with\r\nrespect by those who did not. We were all convinced that the way to\r\nachieve what is best for Ireland was to develop what is best in\r\nIrishmen. And it was the conviction that this can be done by Irishmen in\r\nIreland that brought together those whose thought and work supplies\r\nwhatever there may be of interest in this book.\r\n\r\nIf I have fairly stated the attitude towards each other of the workers\r\nto whose coming together must be attributed as much of the change in the\r\nIrish situation as is due to Irish initiation, it will be seen that what\r\nhad so long kept them apart in public affairs, outside politics, was a\r\ndifference of opinion, not so much as to the conditions to be dealt\r\nwith, nor, indeed, as to the end to be sought, but rather as to the\r\nmeans most effective for the attainment of that end. I naturally regard\r\nthe view which I am putting forward as being broader than that which has\r\nhitherto prevailed. Some Nationalists may, however, contend that it is\r\nessential to progress that the thoughts and energies of the nation\r\nshould be focussed upon a single movement, and not dissipated in the\r\npursuit of a multiplicity of ideals. I quite admit the importance of\r\nconcentration. But I strongly hold that any movement which is closely\r\nrelated to the main currents of the people's life and subservient to\r\ntheir urgent economic necessities, and which gives free play to the\r\nintellectual qualities, while strengthening the moral or industrial\r\ncharacter, cannot be held to conflict with any national programme of\r\nwork, without raising a strong presumption that there is something wrong\r\nwith the programme. The exclusively political remedy I shall discuss in\r\nthe next chapter, but here I propose to consider some of the problems\r\nwhich the new movement seeks to solve without waiting for the political\r\nmillenium.\r\n\r\nIt is a commonplace that there are two Irelands, differing in race, in\r\ncreed, in political aspiration, and in what I regard as a more potent\r\nfactor than all the others put together--economic interest and\r\nindustrial pursuit. In the mutual misunderstanding of these two\r\nIrelands, still more than in the misunderstanding of Ireland by England,\r\nis to be found the chief cause of the still unsettled state of the Irish\r\nQuestion. I shall not seek to apportion the blame between the two\r\nsections of the population; but as the mists clear away and we can begin\r\nto construct a united and contented Ireland, it is not only legitimate,\r\nbut helpful in the extreme, to assign to the two sections of our\r\nwealth-producers their respective parts in repairing the fortunes of\r\ntheir country. In such a discussion of future developments chief\r\nprominence must necessarily be given to the problems affecting the life\r\nof the majority of the people, who depend directly on the land, and\r\nconduct the industry which produces by far the greater portion of the\r\nwealth of the country. It is, of course, essential to the prosperity of\r\nthe whole community that the North should pursue and further develop\r\nits own industrial and commercial life. That section of the community\r\nhas also, no doubt, economic and educational problems to face, but these\r\nare much the same problems as those of industrial communities in other\r\nparts of the United Kingdom[4]; and if they do not receive, vitally\r\nimportant as is their solution to the welfare of Ireland, any large\r\nshare of attention in this book, it is because they are no part of what\r\nis ordinarily understood by the Irish Question.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the interest of the manufacturing population of Ulster in\r\nthe welfare of the Roman Catholic agricultural majority is not merely\r\nthat of an onlooker, nor even that of the other parts of the United\r\nKingdom, but something more. It is obvious that the internal trade of\r\nthe country depends mainly upon the demand of the rural population for\r\nthe output of the manufacturing towns, and that this demand must depend\r\non the volume of agricultural production. I think the importance of\r\ndeveloping the home market has not been sufficiently appreciated, even\r\nby Belfast. The best contribution the Ulster Protestant population can\r\nmake to the solution of this question is to do what they can to bring\r\nabout cordial co-operation between the two great sections of the\r\nwealth-producers of Ireland. They should, I would suggest, learn to take\r\na broader and more patriotic view of the problems of the Roman Catholic\r\nand agricultural majority, upon the true nature of which I hope to be\r\nable to throw some new light. My purpose will be doubly served if I\r\nhave, to some extent, brought home to the minds of my Northern friends\r\nthat there is in Ireland an unsettled question in which they are largely\r\nconcerned, a rightly unsatisfied people by helping whom they can best\r\nhelp themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Question is, then, in that aspect which must be to Irishmen of\r\nparamount importance, the problem of a national existence, chiefly an\r\nagricultural existence, in Ireland. To outside observers it is the\r\nquestion of rural life, a question which is assuming a social and\r\neconomic importance and interest of the most intense character, not only\r\nfor Ireland North and South, but for almost the whole civilised world.\r\nIt is becoming increasingly difficult in many parts of the world to keep\r\nthe people on the land, owing to the enormously improved industrial\r\nopportunities and enhanced social and intellectual advantages of urban\r\nlife. The problem can be better examined in Ireland than elsewhere, for\r\nwith us it can, to a large extent, be isolated, since we have little\r\nhighly developed town life. Our rural exodus takes our people, for the\r\nmost part, not into Irish or even into British towns, but into those of\r\nthe United States. What is migration in other countries is emigration\r\nwith us, and the mind of the country, brooding over the dreary\r\nstatistics of this perennial drain, naturally and longingly turns to\r\nschemes for the rehabilitation of rural life--the only life it knows.\r\n\r\nWe cannot exercise much direct influence upon the desire to emigrate\r\nbeyond spreading knowledge as to the real conditions of life in America,\r\nfor which home life in Ireland is often ignorantly bartered.[5] We\r\ncannot isolate the phenomenon of emigration and find a cure for it apart\r\nfrom the rest of the Irish Question. We must recognise that emigration\r\nis but the chief symptom of a low national vitality, and that the first\r\nresult of our efforts to stay the tide may increase the outflow. We\r\ncannot fit the people to stay without fitting them to go. Before we can\r\nkeep the people at home we have got to construct a national life with,\r\nin the first place, a secure basis of physical comfort and decency. This\r\nlife must have a character, a dignity, an outlook of its own. A\r\ncomfortable Boeotia will never develop into a real Hibernia Pacata. The\r\nstandard of living may in some ways be lower than the English standard:\r\nin some ways it may be higher. But even if statesmanship and all the\r\nforces of philanthropy and patriotism combined can construct a contented\r\nrural Ireland for the people, it can only be maintained by the people.\r\nIt will have to accord with the national sentiment and be distinctively\r\nIrish. It is this national aspiration, and the remarkable promise of the\r\nmovements making for its fruition, which give to the work of Irish\r\nsocial and economic reform the fascination which those who do not know\r\nthe Ireland of to-day cannot understand. This work of reform must, of\r\ncourse, be primarily economic, but economic remedies cannot be applied\r\nto Irish ills without the spiritual aids which are required to move to\r\naction the latent forces of Irish reason and emotion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe task which we have to face is, then, a two-sided one, but its\r\neconomic and its purely practical aspects first demand consideration.\r\nMany even of the agrarian aspects of the question have, so far, been\r\nsomewhat neglected in Ireland owing to a cause which is not far to seek.\r\nIt has often been asserted that the Irish Question is, at bottom, the\r\nLand Question. There is a great deal of truth in this view, but almost\r\nall those who hold it have fallen into the grave error of tacitly\r\nidentifying the land question with the tenure question--an error which\r\nvitiates a great deal of current theorising about Ireland. It was,\r\nindeed, inevitable that Irish agriculturists, with such an economic\r\nhistory behind them as I have outlined in the previous chapter, should\r\nhave concentrated their attention during the latter half of the\r\nnineteenth century upon obtaining a legislative cure for the ills\r\nproduced by legislation, to the comparative neglect of those equally\r\ndifficult, if less obvious economic questions, which have been brought\r\ninto special prominence by the agricultural depression of the last\r\nquarter of a century. Now, however, that the Land Act of 1903 has been\r\npassed and the solution of the tenure question is in sight, we in\r\nIreland are more free to direct our attention to what is at present the\r\nmost important aspect of the agrarian situation--the necessity for\r\ndetermining the social and economic conditions essential to the\r\nwell-being of the peasant proprietary, which, though it is to be started\r\nwith as bright an outlook as the law can give, must stand or fall by its\r\nown inherent merits or defects. Not only are we now free to give\r\nadequate consideration to this question, but it is also imperative that\r\nwe should do so, for whilst I am hopeful that the Land Act will settle\r\nthe question of tenure, it will obviously not merely leave the other\r\nproblems of agricultural existence--problems some of which are not\r\nunknown in other parts of the United Kingdom--still unsolved, but will\r\nalso increase the necessity for their solution, and will, moreover,\r\nbring in its train complex difficulties of its own.\r\n\r\nThe main features of the depressing outlook of rural life in the United\r\nKingdom are well known. The land steadily passes from under the plough\r\nand is given over to stock raising. As the kine increase the men decay.\r\nIn Ireland the rural exodus takes, as I have already said, the shape,\r\nmainly, not of migration to Irish urban centres, but rather the uglier\r\nform of an emigration which not only depletes our population but drains\r\nit of the very elements which can least be spared.\r\n\r\nThe reason generally given for the widespread resort to the lotus-eating\r\noccupation of opening and shutting gates, in preference to tilling the\r\nsoil, is that in the existing state of agricultural organisation, and\r\nwhile urban life is ever drawing away labour from the fields, the\r\nsubstitution of pasturage for tillage is the readiest way to meet the\r\nruinous competition of Eastern Europe, the Western Hemisphere, and\r\nAustralasia. Yet upon the economic merits of this process I have heard\r\nthe most diverse opinions stated with equal conviction by men thoroughly\r\nwell informed as to the conditions. One of the largest graziers in\r\nIreland recently gave me a picture of what he considered to be an ideal\r\neconomic state for the country. If two more Belfasts could be\r\nestablished on the east coast, and the rest of the country divided into\r\nfive hundred acre farms, grazing being adopted wherever permanent grass\r\nwould grow, the limits of Irish productivity would be reached. On the\r\nother hand, Dr. O'Donnell, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Raphoe, who may\r\nbe taken as an authoritative exponent of the trend of popular thought in\r\nthe country, not long ago advocated ploughing the grazing lands of\r\nLeinster right up to the slopes of Tara.[6] Moreover, many theories have\r\nbeen advanced to show that the decline of tillage, whatever be its\r\ncause, involves an enormous waste of national resources. But of\r\npractical suggestion, making for a remedy, there is very little\r\nforthcoming.\r\n\r\nThe solution of all such problems largely depends upon certain\r\ndevelopments which, for many reasons, I regard as absolutely essential\r\nto the success of the new agrarian order. One of these developments is\r\nthe spread of agricultural co-operation through voluntary associations.\r\nWithout this agency of social and economic progress, small landholders\r\nin Ireland will be but a body of isolated units, having all the\r\ndrawbacks of individualism, and none of its virtues, unorganised and\r\nsingularly ill-equipped for that great international struggle of our\r\ntime, which we know as agricultural competition. Moreover, there is\r\nanother equally important, if less obvious, consideration which renders\r\nurgent the organisation of our rural communities. From Russia, with its\r\nhalf-communistic Mir to France with its modern village commune, there is\r\nno country in Europe except the United Kingdom where the peasant\r\nland-holders have not some form of corporate existence. In Ireland the\r\ntransition from landlordism to a peasant proprietary not only does not\r\ncreate any corporate existence among the occupying peasantry but rather\r\ndeprives them of the slight social coherence which they formerly\r\npossessed as tenants of the same landlord. The estate office has its\r\nuses as well as its disadvantages, and the landlord or agent is by no\r\nmeans without his value as a business adviser to those from whom he\r\ncollects the rent.\r\n\r\nThe organisation of the peasantry by an extension of voluntary\r\nassociations, which is a condition precedent of social and economic\r\nprogress, will not, however, suffice to enable them to face and solve\r\nthe problems with which they are confronted, and whose solution has now\r\nbecome a matter of very serious concern to the British taxpayer. The\r\ncondition of our agrarian life clearly indicates the necessity for\r\nsupplementing voluntary effort with a sound system of State aid to\r\nagriculture and industry--a necessity fully recognised by the\r\ngovernments of every progressive continental country and of our own\r\ncolonies. An altogether hopeful beginning of combined self-help and\r\nState assistance has been already made. Those who have been studying\r\nthese problems, and practically preparing the way for the proper care of\r\na peasant proprietary, have overcome the chief obstacles which lay in\r\ntheir path. They have gained popular acceptance for the principle that\r\nState aid should not be resorted to until organised voluntary effort has\r\nfirst been set in motion, and that any departure from this principle\r\nwould be an unwarrantable interference with the business of the people,\r\na fatal blow to private enterprise.[7]\r\n\r\nThe task before the people, and before the State, of placing the new\r\nagrarian order upon a permanent basis of decency and comfort is no light\r\none. Indeed, I doubt whether Parliament realises one-tenth of the\r\nproblems which the latest land legislation--by far the best we have yet\r\nhad--leaves unsolved. This becomes only too clear the moment we consider\r\nseriously the fundamental question of the relation of population to area\r\nin rural Ireland, or, in other words, when we inquire how many people\r\nthe agricultural land will support under existing circumstances, or\r\nunder any attainable improvement of the conditions in our rural life.\r\nRoughly speaking, the surface area of the island is 20,000,000 acres, of\r\nwhich 5,000,000 are described in the official returns as 'barren\r\nmountain, bog and waste.' This leaves us with some 15,000,000 acres\r\navailable for agriculture and grazing, which area is now divided into\r\nsome 500,000 holdings. Thus we have an average of thirty acres in extent\r\nfor the Irish agricultural holding. But, unhappily, the returns show\r\nthat some 200,000 of these holdings are from one to fifteen acres in\r\nextent. Nor do the mere figures show the case at its worst. For it\r\nhappens that the small holdings in Ireland, unlike those on the\r\nContinent, are generally on the poorest land, and the majority of them\r\ncannot come within any of the definitions of an 'economic holding.'\r\n\r\nThese 200,000 holdings, the homes of nearly a million persons, threaten\r\nto prove the greatest danger to the future of agricultural Ireland. As\r\nthe majority of them, as at present constituted, do not provide the\r\nphysical basis of a decent standard of living, the question arises, how\r\nare they to be improved? Putting aside emigration, which at one period\r\nwas necessary and ought to have been aided and controlled by the State,\r\nbut which is now no longer a statesman's remedy, there is obviously no\r\nsolution except by the migration of a portion of the occupiers, and the\r\nutilisation of the vacated holdings in order to enable the peasants who\r\nremain to prosper--much as a forest is thinned to promote the growth of\r\ntrees. In typical congested districts this operation will have to be\r\ncarried out on a much larger scale than is generally realised, for a\r\nconsiderable majority of families will have to be removed, in order to\r\nallow a sufficient margin for the provision of adequate holdings for\r\nthose who remain. In some cases, there are large grazing tracts in close\r\nproximity to the congested area which might be utilised for the\r\nre-settlement, but where this is not so and the occupiers of the vacated\r\nholdings have to migrate a considerable distance, the problem becomes\r\nfar more difficult. I need not dwell upon the administrative\r\ndifficulties of the operation, which are not light. I may assume, also,\r\nthat there will be no difficulty in obtaining suitable land somewhere. I\r\ndo not myself attach much weight to the unwillingness of the people to\r\nleave their old holdings for better ones, or to the alleged objection of\r\nthe clergy to allow their parishioners to go to another parish. More\r\nserious is the possible opposition of those who live in the vicinity of\r\nthe unoccupied land about to be distributed, and who feel that they have\r\nthe first claim upon the State in any scheme for its redistribution with\r\nthe help of public credit. Mr. Parnell promoted a company with the sole\r\nobject of practically demonstrating how this problem could be solved. A\r\nlarge capital was raised, and a large estate purchased; but the company\r\ndid not effect the migration of a single family. Still these are minor\r\nconsiderations compared with the larger one, to which I must briefly\r\nrefer.\r\n\r\nUnder the Land Act of 1903 much has been done to facilitate the transfer\r\nof peasants to new farms, but it is obvious that land cannot be handed\r\nover as a gift from the State to the families which migrate. They will\r\nbecome debtors for the value of the land itself, less perhaps a small\r\nsum which may be credited to them in respect of the tenant's interest in\r\nthe holdings they have abandoned. This deduction will, however, be lost\r\nin the expenditure required upon houses, buildings, fences, and other\r\nimprovements which would have to be effected before the land could be\r\nprofitably occupied. Speaking generally they will have no money or\r\nagricultural implements, and their live stock will in many cases be\r\nmortgaged to the local shopkeeper who has always financed them. It will\r\nbe necessary for the future welfare of the country to give them land\r\nwhich admits of cultivation upon the ordinary principles of modern\r\nagriculture; but without working capital, and bringing with them neither\r\nthe skill nor the habits necessary for the successful conduct of their\r\nindustry under the new conditions, it will be no easy task to place them\r\nin a position to discharge their obligations to the State. It is all\r\nvery easy to talk about the obvious necessity of giving more land to\r\ncultivators who have not enough to live upon; and there is, no doubt, a\r\npoetic justice in the Utopian agrarianism which dangles before the eyes\r\nof the Connaught peasantry the alternative of Heaven or Leinster. But\r\nwhen we come down to practical economics, and face the task of giving to\r\na certain number of human beings, in an extremely backward industrial\r\ncondition, the opportunity of placing themselves and their families on a\r\nbasis of permanent well-being, it will be evident that, so far, at any\r\nrate, as this particular community is concerned, the mere provision of\r\nan economic holding is after all but a part of an economic existence.\r\n\r\nI have touched upon this question of migration from uneconomic to\r\neconomic holdings because it signally illustrates the importance of the\r\nhuman, in contradistinction to the merely material considerations\r\ninvolved in the solution of the many-sided Irish Question. I must now\r\nreturn to the wider question of the relation of population to area in\r\nrural Ireland, as it affects the general scheme of agricultural and\r\nindustrial development.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that there must be a limit to the number of individuals\r\nthat the land can support. Allowing an average of five members for each\r\nfamily, and allowing for a considerable number of landless labourers, it\r\nseems that the land at present directly supports about 2,500,000\r\npersons--a view which, I may add, is fully borne out by the figures of\r\nthe recent census; and it is hard to see how a population living by\r\nagriculture can be much increased beyond this number. Even if all the\r\nland in Ireland were available for re-distribution in equal shares, the\r\nhigher standard of comfort to which it is essential that the condition\r\nof our people should be raised would forbid the existence of much more\r\nthan half a million peasant proprietors.[8] Hence the evergreen query,\r\n'What shall we do with our boys?' remains to be answered; for while the\r\nabolition of dual ownership will enable the present generation to bring\r\nup their children according to a higher standard of living, the change\r\nwill not of itself provide a career for the children when they have been\r\nbrought up. The next generation will have to face this problem:--the\r\naverage farm can support only one of the children and his family, what\r\nis to become of the others? The law forbids sub-division for two\r\ngenerations, and after that, _ex hypothesi_, the then prevailing\r\nconditions of life will also prevent such partition. A few of the next\r\ngeneration may become agricultural labourers, but this involves\r\ndescending to the lowest standard of living of to-day, and in any case\r\nthe demand for agricultural labourers is not capable of much extension\r\nin a country of small peasant proprietors.\r\n\r\nAgainst this view I know it is pointed out that in the earlier part of\r\nthe nineteenth century the agricultural population of Ireland was as\r\nlarge as is the total population of to-day; but we know the sequel.\r\nInstances are also cited of peasant proprietaries in foreign countries\r\nwhich maintain a high standard of living upon small, sometimes\r\ndiminutive, and highly-rented holdings. We must remember, however, that\r\nin these foreign countries State intervention has undoubtedly done much\r\nto render possible a prosperous peasant proprietary by, for example, the\r\ndissemination of useful information, admirable systems of technical\r\neducation in agriculture, cheap and expeditious transport, and even\r\nState attention to the distribution of agricultural produce in distant\r\nmarkets. Again, in many of these countries rural life is balanced by a\r\nhighly industrial town life, as, for instance, in the case of Belgium;\r\nor is itself highly industrialised by the existence of rural industries,\r\nas in the case of Switzerland; while in one notable instance--that of\r\nWürttemberg--both these conditions prevail.\r\n\r\nThe true lesson to be drawn from these foreign analogies is that not by\r\nagriculture alone is Ireland to be saved. The solution of the rural\r\nproblem embraces many spheres of national activity. It involves, as I\r\nhave already said, the further development of manufactures in Irish\r\ntowns. One of the best ways to stimulate our industries is to develop\r\nthe home market by means of an increased agricultural production, and a\r\nhigher standard of comfort among the peasant producers. We shall thus\r\nbe, so to speak, operating on consumption as well as on production, and\r\nso increasing the home demand for Irish manufactures. Perhaps more\r\nurgent than the creation or extension of manufactures on a larger scale\r\nis the development of industries subsidiary to agriculture in the\r\ncountry. This is generally admitted, and most people have a fair\r\nknowledge of the wide and varied range of peasant industries in all\r\nEuropean countries where a prosperous peasantry exists. Nor is there\r\nmuch difficulty in agreeing upon the main conditions to be satisfied in\r\nthe selection of the industries to meet the requirements of our case.\r\nThe men and boys require employment in the winter months, or they will\r\nnot stay, and the rural industries promoted should, as far as possible,\r\nbe those which allow of intermittent attention. The female members of\r\nthe family must have profitable and congenial employment. The\r\nhandicrafts to be promoted must be those which will give scope to the\r\nnative genius and aesthetic sense. But unless we can thus supply the\r\ndemand of the peasant-industry market with products of merit or\r\ndistinctiveness, we shall fail in competition with the hereditary skill\r\nand old established trade of peasant proprietors which have solved this\r\npart of the problem generations ago. This involves the vigorous\r\napplication of a class of instruction of which something will be said\r\nin the proper place.\r\n\r\nSo far the rural industry problem, and the direction in which its\r\nsolution is to be found, are fairly clear. But there is one disadvantage\r\nwith which we have to reckon, and which for many other reasons besides\r\nthe one I am now immediately concerned with, we must seek to remove. A\r\ncommunity does not naturally or easily produce for export that for which\r\nit has itself no use, taste, or desire. Whatever latent capacity for\r\nartistic handicrafts the Irish peasant may possess, it is very rarely\r\nthat one finds any spontaneous attempt to give outward expression to the\r\ninward aesthetic sense. And this brings me to a strange aspect of Irish\r\nlife to which I have often wished, on the proper occasion, to draw\r\npublic attention. The matter arises now in the form of a peculiar\r\ndifficulty which lies in the path of those who endeavour to solve the\r\nproblem of rural life in Ireland, and which, in my belief, has\r\nprofoundly affected the fortunes of the race both at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nTo a sympathetic insight there is a singular and significant void in the\r\nIrish conception of a home--I mean the lack of appreciation for the\r\ncomforts of a home, which might never have been apparent to me had it\r\nnot obtruded itself in the form of a hindrance to social and economic\r\nprogress.[9] In the Irish love of home, as in the larger national\r\naspirations, the ideal has but a meagre material basis, its appeal being\r\nessentially to the social and intellectual instincts. It is not the\r\nphysical environment and comfort of an orderly home that enchain and\r\nattract minds still dominated, more or less unconsciously, by the\r\nassociations and common interests of the primitive clan, but rather the\r\nsense of human neighbourhood and kinship which the individual finds in\r\nthe community. Indeed the Irish peasant scarcely seems to have a home in\r\nthe sense in which an Englishman understands the word. If he love the\r\nplace of his habitation he does not endeavour to improve or to adorn it,\r\nor indeed to make it in any sense a reflection of his own mind and\r\ntaste. He treats life as if he were a mere sojourner upon earth whose\r\ntrue home is somewhere else, a fact often attributed to his intense\r\nfaith in the unseen, but which I regard as not merely due to this cause,\r\nbut also, and in a large measure, as the natural outcome of historical\r\nconditions, to which I shall presently refer.\r\n\r\nWhat the Irishman is really attached to in Ireland is not a home but a\r\nsocial order. The pleasant amenities, the courtesies, the leisureliness,\r\nthe associations of religion, and the familiar faces of the neighbours,\r\nwhose ways and minds are like his and very unlike those of any other\r\npeople; these are the things to which he clings in Ireland and which he\r\nremembers in exile. And the rawness and eagerness of America, the lust\r\nof the eye and the pride of life that meet him, though with no welcoming\r\naspect, at every turn, the sense of being harshly appraised by new\r\nstandards of the nature of which he has but the dimmest conception, his\r\nhelplessness in the fierce current of industrial life in which he is\r\nplunged, the climatic extremes of heat and cold, the early hours and few\r\nholidays: all these experiences act as a rude shock upon the\r\nill-balanced refinement of the Irish immigrant. Not seldom, he or she\r\nloses heart and hope and returns to Ireland mentally and physically a\r\nwreck, a sad disillusionment to those who had been comforted in the\r\nagony of the leave-taking by the assurance that to emigrate was to\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar Irish conception of a home has probably a good deal to do\r\nwith the history of the Irish in the United States. It is well known\r\nthat whatever measure of success the Irish emigrant has there achieved\r\nis pre-eminently in the American city, and not where, according to all\r\nthe usual commonplaces about the Irish race, they ought to have\r\nsucceeded, in American rural life. There they were afforded, and there\r\nthey missed, the greatest opportunity which ever fell to the lot of a\r\npeople agriculturally inclined. During the days of the great emigrations\r\nfrom Ireland, a veritable Promised Land, rich beyond the dreams of\r\nagricultural avarice, was gradually opened up between the Alleghanies\r\nand the Rocky Mountains, which the Irish had only to occupy in order to\r\npossess. Making all allowances for the depressing influences which had\r\nbeen brought to bear upon the spirit of enterprise, and for their\r\nimpoverished condition, I am convinced that a prime cause of the failure\r\nof almost every effort to settle them upon the land was the fact that\r\nthe tenement house, with all its domestic abominations, provided the\r\nsocial order which they brought with them from Ireland, and the lack of\r\nwhich on the western prairie no immediate or prospective physical\r\ncomfort could make good.\r\n\r\nRecently a daughter of a small farmer in County Galway with a family too\r\n'long' for the means of subsistence available, was offered a comfortable\r\nhome on a farm owned by some better-off relatives, only thirty miles\r\naway, though probably twenty miles beyond the limits of her utmost\r\nperegrinations. She elected in preference to go to New York, and being\r\nasked her reason by a friend of mine, replied in so many words, 'because\r\nit is nearer.' She felt she would be less of a stranger in a New York\r\ntenement house, among her relatives and friends who had already\r\nemigrated, than in another part of County Galway. Educational science in\r\nIreland has always ignored the life history of the subject with which it\r\ndealt. In no respect has this neglect been so unconsciously cruel as in\r\nits failure to implant in the Irish mind that appreciation of the\r\nmaterial aspects of the home which the people so badly need both in\r\nIreland and in America If the Irishman abroad became 'a rootless\r\ncolonist of alien earth,' the lot of the Irishman in Ireland has been\r\nnot less melancholy. Sadness there is, indeed, in the story of 'the\r\nsea-divided Gael,' but, to me, it is incomparably less pathetic than\r\ntheir homelessness at home.\r\n\r\nThere are, as I have said, historic reasons for the Celtic view of home\r\nto which my personal observation and experience has induced me to devote\r\nso much space. The Irish people have never had the opportunity of\r\ndeveloping that strong and salutary individualism which, amongst other\r\nthings, imperiously demands, as a condition of its growth, a home that\r\nshall be a man's castle as well as his abiding place. In this, as in so\r\nmuch else, a healthy evolution was constantly thwarted by the clash of\r\ntwo peoples and two civilisations. The Irish had hardly emerged from the\r\nnomad pastoral stage, when the first of that series of invasions, which\r\nhad all the ferocity, without the finality of conquest, made settled\r\nlife impossible over the greater part of the island. An old chronicle\r\nthrows some vivid light upon the way in which the idea of home life\r\npresented itself to the mind of the clan chiefs as late as the days of\r\nthe Tudors. \"Con O'Neal,\" we are told, \"was so right Irish that he\r\ncursed all his posterity in case they either learnt English, sowed wheat\r\nor built them houses; lest the first should breed conversation, the\r\nsecond commerce, and with the last they should speed as the crow that\r\nbuildeth her nest to be beaten out by the hawk.\"[10] The penal laws,\r\nagain, acted as a disintegrant of the home and the family; and,\r\nfinally, the paralysing effect of the abuses of a system of land tenure,\r\nunder which evidences of thrift and comfort might at any time become\r\ndetermining factors in the calculation of rent, completed a series of\r\ncauses which, in unison or isolation, were calculated to destroy at its\r\nsource the growth of a wholesome domesticity. These causes happily, no\r\nlonger exist, and powerful forces are arising to overcome the defects\r\nand disadvantages which they have bequeathed to us; and I have little\r\ndoubt that it will be possible to deal successfully with this obstacle\r\nwhich adds so peculiar a feature to the problem of rural life in\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nIf I have dwelt at what may appear to be a disproportionate length upon\r\nthe Irishman's peculiar conception of a home, it is because this\r\ndifficulty, which Irish social and economic reformers still encounter,\r\nand with which they must deal sympathetically if they are to succeed in\r\nthe work of national regeneration, strikingly illustrates the two-sided\r\ncharacter of the Irish Question and the never-to-be-forgotten\r\ninter-dependence of the sentimental and the practical in Ireland. I\r\nadmit that this condition which adds to the interest of the problem, and\r\nperhaps makes it more amenable to rapid solution, is an indication of a\r\nweakness of moral fibre to which must be largely attributed our failure\r\nto be master of our circumstances. Indeed, as I come into closer touch\r\nwith the efforts which are now being made to raise the material\r\ncondition of the people, the more convinced I become, much as my\r\npractical training has made me resist the conviction, that the Irish\r\nQuestion is, in its most difficult and most important aspects, the\r\nproblem of the Irish mind, and that the solution of this problem is to\r\nbe found in the strengthening of Irish character.\r\n\r\nWith this enunciation of the main proposition of my book, I may now\r\nindicate the order in which I shall endeavour to establish its truth. I\r\nhave said enough to show that I do not ignore the historical causes of\r\nour present state; but with so many facts with which we can deal\r\nconfronting us, I propose to review the chief living influences to which\r\nthe Irish mind and character are still subjected. These influences fall\r\nnaturally into three distinct categories and will be treated in the\r\nthree succeeding chapters. The first will show the effect upon the Irish\r\nmind of its obsession by politics. The next will deal with the influence\r\nof religious systems upon the secular life of the people. I shall then\r\nshow how education, which should not only have been the most potent of\r\nall the three influences in bringing our national life into line with\r\nthe progress of the age, but should also have modified the operation of\r\nthe other two causes, has aggravated rather than cured the malady.\r\n\r\nWhatever impression I may succeed in making upon others, I may here\r\nstate that, as the result of observation and reflection, the conclusion\r\nhas been forced upon me that the Irish mind is suffering from\r\nconsiderable functional derangement, but not, so far as I can discern,\r\nfrom any organic disease. This is the basis of my optimism. I shall\r\nsubmit in another chapter, which will conclude the first, the critical\r\npart of my book, certain new principles of treatment which are indicated\r\nby the diagnosis; and I would ask the reader, before he rejects the\r\nopinions which are there expressed, to persevere through the narrative\r\ncontained in the second part of the book. There he will find in process\r\nof solution some of the problems which I have indicated, and the\r\nprinciples for which a theoretical approval has been asked, in practical\r\noperation, and already passing out of the experimental stage. The story\r\nof the Self-help Movement will strike the note of Ireland's economic\r\nhopes. The action of the Recess Committee will be explained, and the\r\nconcession of their demand by the establishment of a 'Department of\r\nAgriculture and other rural industries and for Technical Instruction for\r\nIreland,' will be described. This will complete the story of a quiet,\r\nunostentatious movement which will some day be seen to have made the\r\nlast decade of the nineteenth century a fit prelude to a future\r\ncommensurate with the potentialities of the Irish people.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] I speak from personal knowledge when I say that the leaders of Irish\r\nindustry and commerce are fully alive to the practical consideration\r\nwhich they have now to devote to the new conditions by which they are\r\nsurrounded. They recognise that the intensified foreign competition\r\nwhich harasses them is due chiefly to German education and American\r\nenterprise. They are deep in the consideration of the form which\r\ntechnical education should take to meet their peculiar needs; and I am\r\nconfident that Ulster will make a sound and useful contribution to the\r\nsolution of the commercial and industrial problems which confront the\r\nmanufacturers of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n[5] That such a knowledge is still required, though the need is becoming\r\nless urgent, is shown by an incident which illustrates the pathos of the\r\nIrish exodus. A poor woman once asked me to help her son to emigrate to\r\nAmerica, and I agreed to pay his passage. Early in the negotiations,\r\nfinding that she was somewhat vague as to her boy's prospects, I asked\r\nher whether he wanted to go to North or South America. This detail she\r\nseemed to consider immaterial. \"Ach, glory be to God, I lave that to yer\r\nhonner. Why wouldn't I?\" Had I shipped him to Peru she would have been\r\nquite satisfied. Why wouldn't she?\r\n\r\n[6] Yet another view which seems to uproot most agrarian ideas in\r\nIreland has been put forward by Dr. O'Gara in _The Green Republic_\r\n(Fisher Unwin, 1902). His main conclusion is that the present disastrous\r\nstate of our rural economy is due to our treating land as an object of\r\nproperty and not of industry. He advocates the cultivation of the land\r\nby syndicates holding farms of 20,000 acres and tilling them by the\r\nlavish application of modern machinery as the only way to meet American\r\ncompetition. His book is able and suggestive, but it is perhaps, a work\r\nof supererogation to discuss a theory the whole moral of which is the\r\nexpediency of absolutely divorcing the functions of the proprietor and\r\nthe manager of land at a time when the consensus of opinion in Ireland\r\nis in favour of uniting them, and in view of the fact that under the new\r\nLand Act the future of the country seems inevitably to lie for a long\r\ntime in the hands of a peasant proprietary.\r\n\r\n[7] The reader may wonder why I touch so lightly upon a fact of such\r\nprofound significance as the Irishman's acceptance of self-help as a\r\ncondition precedent of State aid in the development of agriculture and\r\nindustry. But such a cursory treatment, in the early chapters, of this\r\nand of other equally important aspects of the Irish situation is\r\nnecessitated by the plan I have adopted. I am attempting to give in the\r\nfirst part of the book a philosophic insight into the chief Irish\r\nproblems, and then, in the second part of the book, to present the facts\r\nwhich appear to me to illustrate these problems in process of solution.\r\n\r\n[8] The best expert agricultural opinion tells me that under present\r\nconditions a family cannot live in any decent standard of comfort--such\r\nas I hope to see prevail in Ireland--on less than 30 acres of Irish\r\nland, taking the bad land with the good.\r\n\r\n[9] It is, of course, unnecessary for me to dwell upon the part played\r\nby the home in the standard of living, especially amongst a rural\r\ncommunity. But it may not be irrelevant to note that M. Desmolins, who,\r\nin his remarkable book, _A quoi tient la superiorité des Anglo-saxons_?\r\nhands over the future of civilisation to the Anglo-Saxons, ascribes to\r\nthe English rural home much of the success of the race.\r\n\r\n[10] Speed's Chronicle, quoted in _Calendar of State Papers, Ireland,_\r\n1611-14, p. xix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCE OF POLITICS UPON THE IRISH MIND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the humours of the Home Rule struggle, the story was current in\r\nEngland that a peasant in Connemara ceased planting his potatoes when\r\nthe news of the introduction of the Home Rule Bill in 1886 seemed to\r\nbring the millenium into the region of practical politics. Those who\r\nused the story were not slow to suggest that, had the Bill become law,\r\nthe failure of spontaneous generation in the Connemara potato patch\r\nmight have been typical of much analogous disillusionment elsewhere.\r\nEven to those who are familiar with our history, the faith of the Irish\r\npeople in the potentialities of government, which this little tale\r\nillustrates by caricature, will give cause for reflection of another and\r\nmore serious kind. The moral to be drawn by Irish politicians is that we\r\nin Ireland have yet to free ourselves from one of the worst legacies of\r\npast misgovernment, the belief that any legislation or any legislature\r\ncan provide an escape from the physical and mental toil imposed through\r\nour first parents upon all nations for all time.\r\n\r\n'The more business in politics, and the less politics in business, the\r\nbetter for both,' is a maxim which I brought home from the Far West and\r\nventured to advocate publicly some years ago. Being still of the same\r\nmind, I regret that I am compelled to introduce a whole chapter of\r\npolitics into this book, which is a study of Irish affairs mainly from a\r\nsocial and economic point of view. But to ignore, either in the\r\ndiagnosis or in the treatment of the 'mind diseased,' the political\r\nobsession of our national life would be about as wise as to discuss and\r\nplan a Polar expedition without taking account of the climatic\r\nconditions to be encountered.\r\n\r\nIn such an examination of Irish politics as thus becomes necessary I\r\nshall have to devote the greater part of my criticism to the influence\r\nof the Nationalist party upon the Irish mind. But it will be seen that\r\nthis course is not taken with a view to making party capital for my own\r\nside. As I read Irish history, neither party need expect very much\r\ncredit for more than good intentions. Whichever proves to be right in\r\nits main contention, each will have to bear its share of the\r\nresponsibility for the long continuance of the barren controversy. Each\r\nhas neglected to concern itself with the settlement of vitally important\r\nquestions the consideration of which need not have been postponed\r\nbecause the constitutional question still remained in dispute.\r\nTherefore, though I seem to throw upon the Nationalist party the chief\r\nblame for our present political backwardness, and, so far as politics\r\naffect other spheres of national activity, for our industrial\r\ndepression, candour compels me to admit that Irish Unionism has failed\r\nto recognise its obligation--an obligation recognised by the Unionist\r\nparty in Great Britain--to supplement opposition to Home Rule with a\r\npositive and progressive policy which could have been expected to\r\ncommend itself to the majority of the Irish people--the Irish of the\r\nIrish Question.\r\n\r\nTo my own party in Ireland then, I would first direct the reader's\r\nattention. I have already referred to the deplorable effects produced\r\nupon national life by the exclusion of representatives of the landlord\r\nand the industrial classes from positions of leadership and trust over\r\nfour-fifths of the country. I cannot conceive of a prosperous Ireland in\r\nwhich the influence of these leaders is restricted within its present\r\nbounds. It has been so restricted because the Irish Unionist party has\r\nfailed to produce a policy which could attract, at any rate, moderate\r\nmen from the other side, and we have, therefore, to consider why we have\r\nso failed. Until this is done, we shall continue to share the blame for\r\nthe miserable state of our political life which, at the end of the\r\nnineteenth century, appeared to have made but little advance from the\r\ntime when Bishop Berkeley asked 'Whether our parties are not a burlesque\r\nupon politics.'\r\n\r\nThe Irish Unionist party is supposed to unite all who, like the author,\r\nare opposed to the plunge into what is called Home Rule. But its\r\npropagandist activities in Ireland are confined to preaching the\r\ndoctrine of the _status quo_, and preaching it only to its own side.\r\nFrom the beginning the party has been intimately connected with the\r\nlandlord class; yet even upon the land question it has thrown but few\r\ngleams of the constructive thought which that question so urgently\r\ndemanded, and which it might have been expected to apply to it. Now and\r\nagain an individual tries to broaden the basis of Irish Unionism and to\r\nbring himself into touch with the life of the people. But the nearer he\r\ngets to the people the farther he gets from the Irish Unionist leaders.\r\nThe lot of such an individual is not a happy one: he is regarded as a\r\nmere intruder who does not know the rules of the game, and he is treated\r\nby the leading players on both sides like a dog in a tennis court.\r\n\r\nTwo main causes appear to me to account for the failure of the Irish\r\nUnionist party to make itself an effective force in Irish national life.\r\nThe great misunderstanding to which I have attributed the unhappy state\r\nof Anglo-Irish relations kept the country in a condition of turmoil\r\nwhich enabled the Unionist party to declare itself the party of law and\r\norder. Adopting Lord Salisbury's famous prescription, 'twenty years of\r\nresolute government,' they made it what its author would have been the\r\nlast man to consider it, a sufficient justification for a purely\r\nnegative and repressive policy. Such an attitude was open to somewhat\r\nobvious objections. No one will dispute the proposition that the\r\ngovernment of Ireland, or of any other country, should be resolute, but\r\ntwenty years of resolute government, in the narrow sense in which it\r\ncame to be interpreted, needed for its success, what cannot be had under\r\nparty government, twenty years of consistency. It may be better to be\r\nfeared than to be loved, but Machiavelli would have been the first to\r\nadmit that his principle did not apply where the Government which sought\r\nto establish fear had to reckon with an Opposition which was making\r\ncapital out of love. Moreover, the suggestion that the Irish Question is\r\nnot a matter of policy but of police, while by no means without\r\ninfluential adherents, is altogether vicious. You cannot physically\r\nintimidate Irishmen, and the last thing you want to do is morally to\r\nintimidate a people whose greatest need at the moment is moral courage.\r\n\r\nThe second cause which determined the character of Irish Unionism was\r\nthe linking of the agrarian with the political question; the one being,\r\nin effect, a practical, the other a sentimental issue. The same thing\r\nhappened in the Nationalist party; but on their side it was intentional\r\nand led to an immense accession of strength, while on the Unionist side\r\nit made for weakness. If the influence of Irish Unionists was to be even\r\nmaintained, it was of vital importance that the interest of a class\r\nshould not be allowed to dominate the policy of the party. But the\r\norganisation which ought to have rallied every force that Ireland could\r\ncontribute to the cause of imperial unity came to be too closely\r\nidentified with the landlord class. That class is admittedly essential\r\nto the construction of any real national life. But there is another\r\nelement equally essential, to which the political leaders of Irish\r\nUnionism have not given the prominence which is its due. The Irish\r\nQuestion has been so successfully narrowed down to two simple policies,\r\none positive but vague, the other negative but definite, that to suggest\r\nthat there are three distinct forces--three distinct interests--to be\r\ntaken into account seems like confusing the issue. It is a fact,\r\nnevertheless, that a very important element on the Unionist side, the\r\nindustrial element, has been practically left out of the calculation by\r\nboth sides. Yet the only expression of real political thought which I\r\nhave observed in Ireland, since I have been in touch with Irish life,\r\nhas emanated from the Ulster Liberal-Unionist Association, whose weighty\r\npronouncements, published from time to time, are worthy of deep\r\nconsideration by all interested in the welfare of Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that when the Home Rule controversy was at its\r\nheight, the chief strength of the Irish opposition to Mr. Gladstone's\r\npolicy, and the consideration which most weighed with the British\r\nelectorate, lay in the business objection of the industrial population\r\nof Ulster; though on the platform religious and political arguments were\r\nmore often heard. The intensely practical nature of the objection which\r\ncame from the commercial and industrial classes of the North who opposed\r\nHome Rule was never properly recognised in Ireland. It was, and is still\r\nunanswered. Briefly stated, the position taken up by their spokesmen was\r\nas follows:--'We have come,' they said in effect, 'into Ireland, and not\r\nthe richest portion of the island, and have gradually built up an\r\nindustry and commerce with which we are able to hold our own in\r\ncompetition with the most progressive nations in the world. Our success\r\nhas been achieved under a system and a polity in which we believe. Its\r\nnon-interference with the business of the people gave play to that\r\nself-reliance with which we strove to emulate the industrial qualities\r\nof the people of Great Britain. It is now proposed to place the\r\nmanufactures and commerce of the country at the mercy of a majority\r\nwhich will have no real concern in the interests vitally affected, and\r\nwho have no knowledge of the science of government. The mere shadow of\r\nthese changes has so depressed the stocks which represent the\r\naccumulations of our past enterprise and labour that we are already\r\ncommercially poorer than we were.'[11]\r\n\r\nMy sole criticism of those leaders of commerce and industry in Belfast,\r\nwho, whenever they turn their attention from their various\r\npre-occupations, import into Irish politics the valuable qualities which\r\nthey display in the conduct of their private affairs, is that they do\r\nnot go further and take the necessary steps to give practical effect to\r\ntheir views outside the ranks of their immediate associates and\r\nfollowers. Had the industrial section made its voice heard in the\r\ncouncils of the Irish Unionist party, the Government which that party\r\nsupports might have had less advice and assistance in the maintenance of\r\nlaw and order, but it would have had invaluable aid in its constructive\r\npolicy. For the lack of the wise guidance which our captains of industry\r\nshould have provided, Irish Unionism has, by too close adherence to the\r\ntraditions of the landlord section, been the creed of a social caste\r\nrather than a policy in Ireland. The result has been injurious alike for\r\nthe landlords, the leaders of industry, and the people. The policy of\r\nthe Unionist party in Ireland has been to uphold the Union by force\r\nrather than by a reconciliation of the people to it. It has held aloof\r\nfrom the masses, who, bereft of the guidance of their natural leaders,\r\nhave clung the more closely to the chiefs of the Nationalist party; and\r\nthese in their turn have not, as I shall show presently, risen to their\r\nresponsibility, but have retarded rather than advanced the march of\r\ndemocracy in Ireland. If there is to be any future for Unionism in\r\nIreland, there must be a combination of the best thought of the country\r\naristocracy and that of the captains of industry. Then, and not till\r\nthen, shall we Unionists as a party exercise a healthful and stimulating\r\ninfluence on the thought and action of the people.\r\n\r\nI cannot, therefore, escape from the conclusion that whilst the Irish\r\nsection of the party to which I belong is, in my opinion, right on the\r\nmain political question, its influence is now for the most part\r\nnegative. Hence I direct attention mainly to the Home Rule party, as the\r\nmore forceful element in Irish political life; and if it receives the\r\nmore criticism it is because it is more closely in touch with the\r\npeople, and because any reform in its principles or methods would more\r\ngenerally and more rapidly prove beneficial to the country than would\r\nany change in Unionist policy.\r\n\r\nIn examining the policy of the Nationalist party my chief concern will\r\nbe to arrive at a correct estimate of the effect which is produced upon\r\nthe thought and action of the Irish people by the methods employed for\r\nthe attainment of Home Rule. I propose to show that these methods have\r\nbeen in the past, and must, so long as they are employed, continue to be\r\ninjurious to the political and industrial character of the people, and\r\nconsequently a barrier to progress. I know that most of the Nationalist\r\nleaders justify the employment of these methods on the ground that, in\r\ntheir opinion, the constitutional reforms they advocate are a condition\r\nprecedent to industrial progress. I believe, on the contrary, and I\r\nshall give my reasons for believing, that their tactics have been not\r\nonly a hindrance to industrial progress, but destructive even to the\r\nulterior purpose they were intended to fulfil.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly believed--a belief very naturally fostered by their\r\nleaders--that, if there is one thing the Irish do understand, it is\r\npolitics. Politics is a term obviously capable of wide interpretation,\r\nand I fear that those who say that my countrymen are pre-eminently\r\npoliticians use the term in a sense more applicable to the conceptions\r\nof Mr. Richard Croker than of Aristotle. In intellectual capacity for\r\ndiscrimination upon political issues the average Irish elector is, I\r\nbelieve, far superior to the average English elector. But there is as\r\nyet something wanting in the character of our people which seems to\r\nprohibit the exercise by them of any independent political thought and,\r\nconsequently, of any effective or permanent political influence.\r\n\r\nThe assumption that Irishmen are singularly good politicians seems to\r\nstand seriously in the way of their becoming so; and yet it is a matter\r\nof the greatest importance that they should become good politicians in a\r\nreal sense, for in no country would sound political thought exercise a\r\nmore beneficial influence upon the life of the people than in Ireland.\r\nIndeed I would go further and give it as my strong conviction that,\r\nproperly developed and freed from the narrowing influences of the party\r\nsquabbles by which it has been warped and sterilised, the political\r\nthought of the Irish people would contribute a factor of vital\r\nimportance to the life of the British empire. But at the moment I am\r\ndealing only with the influence of politics on Irish social and economic\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nI am aware that any political deficiencies which the Irish may display\r\nat home, are commonly attributed to the political system which has been\r\nimposed upon Ireland from without. If you want to see Irish genius in\r\nits highest political manifestation, it must be studied, we are told, in\r\nthe United States, the widest and freest arena which has ever been\r\noffered to the race. This view is not in accordance with the facts as I\r\nhave observed them. These facts are somewhat obscured by the natural,\r\nbut misleading habit of reckoning to the account of Ireland at large\r\nachievements really due to the Scotch-Irish, who helped to colonise\r\nPennsylvania, and who undoubtedly played a dominant part in developing\r\nthe characteristic features of the American political system. The\r\nScotch-Irish, however, do not belong to the Ireland of the Irish\r\nQuestion Descended, largely, as their names so often testify, from the\r\nearly Irish colonists of western Scotland, they came back as a distinct\r\nrace, dissociating themselves from the Irish Celts by refusing to adopt\r\ntheir national traditions, or intermarry with them, and both here and in\r\nAmerica disclaiming the appellation of Irish.[12]\r\n\r\nLeaving, then, out of consideration the political achievements of the\r\nScotch-Irish, it appears to me that the part played in politics by the\r\nIrish in America does not testify to any high political genius. They\r\nhave shown there an extraordinary aptitude for political organisation,\r\nwhich, if it had been guided by anything approaching to political\r\nthought, would have placed them in a far higher position in American\r\npublic life than that which they now occupy. But the fact is that it\r\nwould be much easier to find evidence of high political capacity and\r\nsuccess in the history of the Irish in British colonies; and the reason\r\nfor this fact is not only very germane to the purpose of this book, but\r\nhas a strong practical interest for Americans as well. Irishmen when\r\nthey go to America find themselves united by a bond which does not and\r\ncould not exist in the Colonies--though it does exist in Ireland--the\r\nbond of anti-English feeling, and by the hope of giving practical effect\r\nto this feeling through the policy of their adopted country. Imbued with\r\nthis common sentiment, and influenced by their inherited clannishness,\r\nthe Irish in America readily lend themselves to the system of political\r\ngroups, a system which the 'boss' for his own ends seeks to perpetuate.\r\nThe result is a sort of political paradox--it has made the Irish in\r\nAmerica both stronger and weaker than they ought to be. They suffer\r\npolitically from the defects of their political qualities: they are\r\nstrong as a voting machine, but the secret of their collective strength\r\nis also the secret of their individual weakness. This organisation into\r\ngroups is much commoner among the Irish than among other American\r\nimmigrants, for the anti-English feeling with which so many of the Irish\r\nland in America is carefully kept alive by the 'boss,' whose sedulous\r\nfostering of the instinctive clannishness and inherited leader-following\r\nhabits of the Irish saps their independence of thought and prevents them\r\nfrom ceasing to be mere political agents and developing a citizenship\r\nwhich would furnish its due quota of statesmen to the service of the\r\nRepublic. They lack in the United States just what they lack at home,\r\nthe capacity, or at any rate the inclination, to use their undoubted\r\nabilities in a large and foreseeing manner, and so are becoming less and\r\nless powerful as a force in American politics.\r\n\r\nThe fallacious views about the nature and sphere of politics, which the\r\nIrish bring with them from Ireland, and which are perpetuated in\r\nAmerica, have the effect not only of debarring the Irish from real\r\npolitical progress, but also, as at home, from gaining success in\r\nindustrial pursuits which their talents would otherwise win for them.\r\nThey succeed as journalists owing to their quick intelligence and\r\nversatility, and as contractors mainly owing to their capacity for\r\norganising gangs of workmen--a faculty which seems to be the only good\r\nthing resulting from their political education. They are as brilliant\r\nsoldiers in the service of the United States as they are in that of\r\nBritain--more it would be impossible to say--and they have produced\r\ntypes of daring, endurance, and shrewdness like the 'Silver Kings' of\r\nNevada which testify to the exceptional powers always developed by the\r\nIrish in exceptional circumstances. But in the humdrum business of\r\neveryday life in the United States they suffer from defects which are\r\nthe outcome of their devotion to mistaken political ideals and of their\r\nsubordination of industry to politics, which are not always purely\r\nAmerican, but are often influenced by considerations of the country of\r\ntheir birth. On the whole, a quarter of a century of not unsympathetic\r\nobservation of the Irish in the United States has convinced me that the\r\nposition they occupy there is not one which either they or the American\r\npeople can look on with entire satisfaction. The Irish immigrants are\r\nfelt to belong to a kind of _imperium in imperio_, and to carry into\r\nAmerican politics ideas which are not American, and which might easily\r\nbecome an embarrassment if not a danger to America. Hence the powerful\r\ninterest which America shares with England, though of course in a less\r\ndegree, in understanding and helping to settle the complex difficulty\r\ncalled the Irish Question. The Irish remember Ireland long after they\r\nhave left it. They are not in the same position as the German or English\r\nimmigrants who have no cause at home which they wish to forward. Every\r\necho in the States of political or social disturbance in Ireland rouses\r\nthe immigrant and he becomes an Irishman once more, and not a citizen of\r\nthe country of his adoption. His views and votes on international\r\nquestions, in so far as they affect these Islands, are thus often\r\ndictated more by a passionate sympathy for and remembrance of the land\r\nhe no longer lives in, than by any right understanding of the interests\r\nof the new country in which he and his children must live.\r\n\r\nThe only reason why I have examined the assumption that Irishmen display\r\nmarked political capacity in the United States is to make it clear that\r\nthe political deficiencies they manifest at home are to be attributed\r\nmainly to defects of character, and to a conception of politics for\r\nwhich modern English government is very slightly responsible. I admit\r\nthat English government in the past had no small share in producing the\r\nresults we deplore to-day, but the motives and manner of its action\r\nhave, it seems to me, been very imperfectly understood.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the difficulties of English government in Ireland,\r\nuntil a complete military conquest had been effected, were of a\r\npeculiarly complex character. Before the English could impose upon\r\nIreland their own political organisation--and the idea that any other\r\nsystem could work better among the Irish never entered the English\r\nmind--it was obviously necessary that the very antithesis of that\r\norganisation, the clan system, should be abolished. But there were\r\nmilitary and financial objections to carrying out this policy. Irish\r\ncampaigns were very costly, and England was in those days by no means\r\nwealthy. English armies in Ireland, after a short period spent in\r\ndesultory warfare with light armed kernes in the fever-stricken Munster\r\nforests, began to melt away. For many generations, therefore, England,\r\nadopting a policy of _divide et impera_, set clan against clan. Later\r\non, statecraft may be said to have supervened upon military tactics. It\r\nconsisted of attempts made by alternate threats and bribes to induce the\r\nchiefs to transform the clan organisation by the acceptance of English\r\ninstitutions. But any systematic endeavours to complete the\r\ntransformation were soon rendered abortive by being coupled with huge\r\nconfiscations of land. The policy of converting the members of the clans\r\ninto freeholders was subordinated to the policy of planting British\r\ncolonists. After this there was no question of fusion of races or\r\ninstitutions. Plantations on a large scale, self-supporting,\r\nself-protecting, became the policy alike of the soldier and the\r\nstatesman.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable result of these methods was that it was not until a\r\ncomparatively late date that a political conception of an Irish nation\r\nfirst began to emerge out of the congeries of clans. In the State Papers\r\nof the sixteenth century the clans are frequently spoken of as\r\n'nations.' Even as late as the eighteenth century a Gaelic poet, in a\r\ntypical lament, thus identifies his country with the fortunes of her\r\ngreat families:--\r\n\r\n    The O'Doherty is not holding sway, nor his noble race;\r\n    The O'Moores are not strong, that once were brave--\r\n    O'Flaherty is not in power, nor his kinsfolk;\r\n    And sooth to say, the O'Briens have long since become English.\r\n\r\n    Of O'Rourke there is no mention--my sharp wounding!\r\n    Nor yet of O'Donnell in Erin;\r\n    The Geraldines they are without vigour--without a nod,\r\n    And the Burkes, the Barrys, the Walshes of the slender ships.[13]\r\n\r\nThe modern political idea of Irish nationality at length asserted itself\r\nas the result of three main causes. The bond of a common grievance\r\nagainst the English foe was created by the gradual abandonment of the\r\npolicy of setting clan against clan in favour of impartial confiscation\r\nof land from friendly as well as from hostile chiefs. Secondly, when the\r\nEnglish had destroyed the natural leaders, the clan chiefs, and\r\nattempted to proselytise their adherents, the political leadership\r\nlargely passed to the Roman Catholic Church, which very naturally\r\ndefended the religion common to the members of all the clans, by trying\r\nto unite them against the English enemy. Nationality, in this sense, of\r\ncourse applied only to Celtic Roman Catholic Ireland. The first real\r\nidea of a United Ireland arose out of the third cause, the religious\r\ngrievances of the Protestant dissenters and the commercial grievances of\r\nthe Protestant manufacturers and artisans in the eighteenth century, who\r\nsuffered under a common disability with the Roman Catholics, and many of\r\nwhom came in the end to make common cause with them. But even long after\r\nthis conception had become firmly established, the local representative\r\ninstitutions corresponding to those which formed the political training\r\nof the English in law and administration either did not exist in Ireland\r\nor were altogether in the hands of a small aristocracy, mostly of\r\nnon-Irish origin, and wholly non-Catholic. O'Connell's great work in\r\nfreeing Roman Catholic Ireland from the domination of the Protestant\r\noligarchy showed the people the power of combination, but his methods\r\ncan hardly be said to have fostered political thought. The efforts in\r\nthis direction of men like Gavan Duffy, Davis, and Lucas were\r\nneutralised by the Famine, the after effects of which also did much to\r\nthwart Butt's attempts to develop serious public opinion amongst a\r\npeople whose political education had been so long delayed. The prospect\r\nof any early fruition of such efforts vanished with the revolutionary\r\nagrarian propaganda, and independent thinking--so necessary in the\r\nmodern democratic state--never replaced the old leader-following habit\r\nwhich continued until the climax was reached under Parnell.\r\n\r\nThe political backwardness of the Irish people revealed itself\r\ncharacteristically when, in 1884, the English and Irish democracies were\r\nsimultaneously endowed with a greatly extended franchise. In theory this\r\nconcession should have developed political thought in the people and\r\nshould have enhanced their sense of political responsibility. In England\r\nno doubt this theory was proved by the event to be based on fact; but in\r\nIreland it was otherwise. Parnell was at the zenith of his power. The\r\nIrish had the man, what mattered the principles? The new suffrages\r\nsimply became the figures upon the cheques handed over to the Chief by\r\neach constituency, with the request that he would fill in the name of\r\nthe payee. On one or two occasions a constituency did protest against\r\nthe payee, but all that was required to settle the matter was a personal\r\nvisit from the Chief. Generally speaking, the electorate were quite\r\ndocile, and instances were not wanting of men discovering that they had\r\nfound favour with electors to whom their faces and even their names were\r\npreviously unknown.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, the one-man system had a tactical value, of which the English\r\nthemselves were ever ready to make use. \"If all Ireland cannot rule this\r\nman, then let this man rule all Ireland,\" said Henry VII. of the Earl of\r\nKildare; and the echo of these words was heard when the Kilmainham\r\nTreaty was negotiated with the last man who wore the mantle of the\r\nchief. But whatever may be said for the one-man system as a means of\r\npolitical organisation, it lacked every element of political education.\r\nIt left the people weaker, if possible, and less capable than it found\r\nthem; and assuredly it was no fit training for Home Rule. While\r\nParnell's genius was in the ascendant, all was well--outwardly. When a\r\ntragic and painful disclosure brought about a crisis in his fate, it\r\nwill hardly be contended by the most devoted admirer of the Irish people\r\nthat the situation was met with even moderate ability and foresight. But\r\nthe logic of events began to take effect. The decade of dissension which\r\nfollowed the fall of Parnell will, perhaps, some day be recognised as a\r\nmost fruitful epoch in modern Irish history. The reaction from the\r\none-man system set in as soon as the one man had passed away. The\r\nindependence which Parnell's former lieutenants began to assert when the\r\nlaurels faded upon the brow of the uncrowned King communicated itself to\r\nsome extent to the rank and file. The mere weighing of the merits of\r\nseveral possible successors led to some wholesome questioning as to the\r\nmerits of the policies, such as they were, which they respectively\r\nrepresented The critical spirit which was now called forth, did not, at\r\nfirst, go very far; but it was at least constructive and marked a\r\ndistinct advance towards real political thought. I believe the day will\r\ncome, and come soon, when Nationalist leaders themselves will recognise\r\nthat while bemoaning faction and dissension and preaching the cause of\r\n'unity' they often mistook the wheat for the tares. They will, I feel\r\nsure, come to realise that the passing of the dictatorship, which to\r\noutward appearances left the people as \"sheep without a shepherd, when\r\nthe snow shuts out the sky,\" in fact turned the thoughts of Ireland in\r\nsome measure away from England into her own bosom, and gave birth there\r\nto the idea of a national life to which the Irish people of all classes,\r\ncreeds, and politics could contribute of their best.\r\n\r\nI sometimes wonder whether the leaders of the Nationalist party really\r\nunderstand the full effect of their tactics upon the political character\r\nof the Irish people, and whether their vision is not as much obscured by\r\na too near, as is the vision of the Unionist leaders by a too distant,\r\nview of the people's life. Everyone who seeks to provide practical\r\nopportunities for Irish intellect to express-itself worthily in active\r\nlife--and this, I take it, is part of what the Nationalist leaders wish\r\nto achieve--meets with the same difficulty. The lack of initiative and\r\nshrinking from responsibility, the moral timidity in glaring contrast\r\nwith the physical courage--which has its worst manifestation in the\r\nintense dread of public opinion, especially when the unknown terrors of\r\neditorial power lurk behind an unfavourable mention 'on the paper,'\r\nare, no doubt, qualities inherited from a primitive social state in\r\nwhich the individual was nothing and the community everything. These\r\ndefects were intensified in past generations by British statecraft,\r\nwhich seemed unable to appreciate or use the higher instincts of the\r\nrace; they remain to-day a prominent factor in the great human problem\r\nknown as the Irish Question--a factor to which, in my belief, may be\r\nattributed the greatest of its difficulties.\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear that education should have been the remedy for the\r\ndefects of character upon which I am forced to dwell so much; and I\r\ncannot absolve any body of Irishmen, possessed of actual or potential\r\ninfluence, of failure to recognise this truth. But here I am dealing\r\nonly with the political leaders, and trying to bring home to them the\r\nresponsibility which their power imposes upon them, not only for the\r\npolitical development but also for the industrial progress of their\r\nfollowers. They ought to have known that the weakness of character which\r\nrenders the task of political leadership in Ireland comparatively easy\r\nis in reality the quicksand of Irish life, and that neither\r\nself-government nor any other institution can be enduringly built upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the Nationalist party are, of course, entitled to hold\r\nthat, in existing political conditions, any non-political movement\r\ntowards national advancement, which in its nature cannot be linked, as\r\nthe land question was linked, to the Home Rule movement constitutes an\r\nunwarrantable sacrifice of ends to means. And so holding, they are\r\nfurther entitled to subject any proposal to elevate popular thought, or\r\nto direct popular activities, to a strict censorship as to its remote as\r\nwell as to its immediate effect upon the electorate. I know, too, that\r\nit is held by some thinking Nationalists who take no active part in\r\npolitics that the politicians are justified on tactical grounds in this\r\nexclusive pursuit of their political aims, and in the methods by which\r\nthey pursue them. They consider the present system of government too\r\nradically wrong to mend, and they can undoubtedly point to agrarian\r\nlegislation as evidence of the effectiveness of the means they employ to\r\ngain their end.\r\n\r\nThis view of things has sunk very deep into the Irish mind. The policy\r\nof 'giving trouble' to the Government is looked upon as the one road to\r\nreform and is believed in so fervently that, except for religion, which\r\nsometimes conflicts with it, there is scarcely any capacity left for\r\nbelief in anything else. I am far from denying that the past offers much\r\njustification for the belief that nothing can be gained by Ireland from\r\nEngland except through violent agitation. Until recently, I admit,\r\nIreland's opportunity had to wait for England's difficulty. But, as\r\npractised in the present day, I believe this doctrine to be mischievous\r\nand false. For one thing, there is a new England to deal with. The\r\nEngland which, certainly not in deference to violent agitation,\r\nestablished the Congested Districts Board, gave Local Government to\r\nIreland, and accepted the recommendations of the Recess Committee for\r\nfar-reaching administrative changes, as well as those of the Land\r\nConference which involved great financial concessions, is not the\r\nEngland of fifty years ago, still less the England of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Moreover, in riveting the mind of the country on what is to be\r\nobtained from England, this doctrine of 'giving trouble,' the whole\r\ngospel of the agitator, has blinded the Irish people to the many things\r\nwhich Ireland can do for herself. Whatever may be said of what is called\r\n'agitation' in Ireland as an engine for extorting legislation from the\r\nImperial Parliament, it is unquestionably bad for the much greater end\r\nof building up Irish character and developing Irish industry and\r\ncommerce. 'Agitation,' as Thomas Davis said, 'is one means of redress,\r\nbut it leads to much disorganisation, great unhappiness, wounds upon the\r\nsoul of a country which sometimes are worse than the thinning of a\r\npeople by war.'[14] If Irish politicians had at all realised this truth,\r\nit is difficult to believe that the popular movement of the last quarter\r\nof a century would not have been conducted in a manner far less\r\ninjurious to the soul of Ireland and equally or more effective for\r\nlegislative reform as well as all other material interests.\r\n\r\nNow, modern Nationalism in Ireland is open to damaging criticism not\r\nonly from my Unionist point of view, which was also, in many respects,\r\nthe view of so strong a Nationalist as Thomas Davis; it is also open to\r\ngrave objection from the point of view of the effectiveness of the\r\ntactics employed for the attainment of its end--the winning of Home\r\nRule.\r\n\r\nBefore examining the effect of these tactics I may point out that this\r\nconception of Nationalist policy, even if justifiable from a practical\r\npoint of view, does not relieve the leaders from the obligation of\r\ngiving some assurance that they are ready with a consistent scheme of\r\nre-construction, and are prepared to build when the ground has been\r\ncleared. In this connection I might make a good deal of Unionist\r\ncapital, and some points in support of my condemnation of the political\r\nabsorption of the Irish mind, out of the total failure of the\r\nNationalist party to solve certain all-important constitutional and\r\nfinancial problems which months of Parliamentary debate in 1893 tended\r\nrather to obscure than to elucidate. I am, however, willing for\r\nargument's sake to postpone all such questions, vital as they are, to\r\nthe time when they can be practically dealt with. I am ready to assume\r\nthat the wit of man can devise a settlement of many points which seemed\r\ninsoluble in Mr. Gladstone's day. But even granting all this, I think it\r\ncan easily be shown that the means which the political thought\r\navailable on the Nationalist side has evolved for the attainment of\r\ntheir end, and which _ex hypothesi_ are only to be justified on tactical\r\ngrounds, are the least likely to succeed; and that, consequently, they\r\nshould be abandoned in favour of a constructive policy which, to say the\r\nleast, would not be less effective towards advancing the Home Rule\r\ncause, if that cause be sound, and which would at the same time help the\r\nadvancement of Ireland in other than political directions.\r\n\r\nTactics form but a part of generalship, and half the success of\r\ngeneralship lies in making a correct estimate of the opposing forces.\r\nThis is as true of political as it is of military operations. Now, of\r\nwhat do the forces opposed to Home Rule consist? The Unionists, it may\r\nbe admitted, are numerically but a small minority of the population of\r\nIreland--probably not more than one-fourth. But what do they represent?\r\nFirst, there are the landed gentry. Let us again make a concession for\r\nthe sake of argument and accept the view that this class so wantonly\r\nkept itself aloof from the life of the majority of the people that the\r\nNationalists could not be expected to count them among the elements of a\r\nHome Rule Ireland. I note, in passing, with extreme gratification that\r\nat the recent Land Conference it was declared by the tenants'\r\nrepresentatives that it was desirable, in the interests of Ireland, that\r\nthe present owners of land should not be expatriated, and that\r\ninducements should be afforded to selling owners to continue to reside\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\nBut I may ignore this as I wish here to recall attention to that other\r\nelement, which was, as I have already said, the real force which turned\r\nthe British democracy against Home Rule--I mean the commercial and\r\nindustrial community in Belfast and other hives of industry in the\r\nnorth-east corner of the country, and in scattered localities elsewhere.\r\nI have already admitted that the political importance of the industrial\r\nelement was not appreciated in Irish Unionist circles. No less\r\nremarkable is the way in which it has been ignored by the Nationalists.\r\nThe question which the Nationalists had to answer in 1886 and 1893, and\r\nwhich they have to answer to-day, is this:--In the Ireland of their\r\nconception is the Unionist part of Ulster to be coerced or persuaded to\r\ncome under the new regime? To those who adopt the former alternative my\r\nreply is simply that, if England is to do the coercion, the idea is\r\npolitically absurd. If we were left to fight it out among ourselves, it\r\nis physically absurd. The task of the Empire in South Africa was light\r\ncompared with that which the Nationalists would have on hands. I am\r\naware that, at the time when we were all talking at concert pitch on the\r\nIrish Question, a good deal was said about dying in the last ditch by\r\nmen who at the threat of any real trouble would be found more discreetly\r\nperched upon the first fence. But those who know the temper and fighting\r\nqualities of the working-men opponents of Home Rule in the North are\r\nunder no illusion as to the account they would give of themselves if\r\ncalled upon to defend the cause of Protestantism, liberty, and imperial\r\nunity as they understand it. Let us, however, dismiss this alternative\r\nand give Nationalists credit for the desire to persuade the industrial\r\nNorth to come in by showing it that it will be to its advantage to join\r\ncordially in the building up of a united Ireland under a separate\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in the way of producing this conviction are very\r\nobvious. The North has prospered under the Act of Union--why should it\r\nbe ready to enter upon a new 'variety of untried being'? What that state\r\nof being will be like, it naturally gauges from the forces which are\r\nworking for Home Rule at present. Looking at these simply from the\r\nindustrial standpoint and leaving out of account all the powerful\r\nelements of religious and race prejudice, the man of the North sees two\r\nsalient facts which have dominated all the political activity of the\r\nNationalist campaign. One is a voluble and aggressive disloyalty, not\r\nmerely to 'England' and to the present system of government, but to the\r\nCrown which represents the unity of the three kingdoms, and the other is\r\nthe introduction of politics into business in the very virulent and\r\ndestructive form known as boycotting.\r\n\r\nNow, hostility to the Crown, if it means anything, means a struggle for\r\nseparation as soon as Home Rule has given to the Irish people the power\r\nto organise and arm. And (still keeping to the sternly practical point\r\nof view) that would, for the time being at least, spell absolute ruin to\r\nthe industrial North. The practice of boycotting, again, is the very\r\nantithesis of industry--it creates an atmosphere in which industry and\r\nenterprise simply cannot live. The North has seen this practice condoned\r\nas a desperate remedy for a desperate ill, but it has seen it continued\r\nlong after the ill had passed away, used as a weapon by one Nationalist\r\nsection against another, and revived when anything like a really\r\noppressive or arbitrary eviction had become impossible. There seems to\r\nhave been in Nationalist circles, since the time of O'Connell, but\r\nlittle appreciation of the deadly character of this social curse; and\r\nthe prospect of a Government which would tolerate it naturally fills the\r\nmind of the Northern commercial man with alarm and aversion.\r\n\r\nAgain, the democratisation of local government which gave the\r\nNationalist leaders a unique opportunity of showing the value, has but\r\nserved to demonstrate the ineffectiveness, of their political tactics.\r\nNorth of Ireland opinion was deeply interested in this reform, and\r\nappreciated its far-reaching importance. Elsewhere, I think it will be\r\nsafe to say, people generally were indifferent to it until it came, and\r\nthe leaders seemed to see in it only a weapon to be used for political\r\npurposes. To the great vista of useful and patriotic work opened out by\r\nthe Act of 1898, to the impression that a proper use of that Act might\r\nmake on Northern opinion, they were blind. It is true that the Councils\r\nwhen left to themselves did admirably, and fully justified the trust\r\nreposed in them. But at the inauguration of local government it was\r\nnaturally not the work of the Councils but the attitude of the party\r\nleaders which appeared to stamp the reception of the Act by the Irish\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIt is true, of course, that many thoughtful men among the Nationalist\r\nparty repudiate the idea that the methods of to-day would be continued\r\nin a self-governed Ireland. I fail to see any reason why they should\r\nnot. Under any system of limited Home Rule questions would arise which\r\nwould afford much the same sort of justification for the employment of\r\nsuch methods, and they could hardly be worse for the welfare of the\r\ncountry then than they are now. There is abundant need and abundant work\r\nin the present day for thoughtful and far-seeing men in a party\r\nconstitutionally so strong as that of the Irish Nationalists. If those\r\namong them who possess, or at any rate can make effective use of\r\nqualities of constructive statesmanship are as few as the history of\r\nrecent years would lead us to suppose, what assurance can Ulster\r\nUnionists feel that such men would spring up spontaneously in an Ireland\r\nunder Home Rule? I admit, indeed, that a considerable measure of such\r\nassurance might be derived from the attitude of the leaders of the party\r\nat and since the Land Conference. But this adoption of statesmanlike\r\nmethods which cannot be too widely understood or too warmly commended is\r\na matter of very recent history; and though we may hope that the success\r\nattending it will help materially in the political education of the\r\nIrish people, that will not, by itself, undo the effect of a quarter of\r\na century of political agitation governed by ideas the very reverse of\r\nthose which are now happily beginning to find favour.\r\n\r\nI have thought it necessary to examine at some length the defence on the\r\nground of tactics which is often made for Nationalist politics, because\r\nit is the only defence ever made by those apologists who admit the\r\ndisturbing influence upon our economic and social life of Nationalist\r\nmethods. A broader and saner view of political tactics than prevailed\r\nten years ago is now possible, for circumstances are becoming friendly\r\nand helpful to the development of political thought. Though the United\r\nIrish League apparently restored 'unity' to the ranks of the\r\nNationalists, the country is, I believe, getting restless under the\r\npolitical bondage, and is seething with a wholesome discontent. In this\r\nvery matter of political education, the stir of corporate life, the\r\nsense of corporate responsibility which in every parish of Ireland are\r\nnow being fostered by the reformed system of local government, must make\r\ntheir influence felt in wider spheres. Even now I believe that the field\r\nis ready for the work of those who would bid the old leader-following\r\nhabit, the product partly of the dead clan system, partly of dying\r\nnational animosities, depart as a thing that has had its day, and who\r\nwould endeavour to train up a race of free, self-reliant, and\r\nindependent citizens in a free state.\r\n\r\nIn this work the very men whose mistaken conception of a united Ireland\r\nI have criticised will, I doubt not, take a leading part. In many\r\nrespects, and these not the least important, no one could desire a\r\nbetter instrument for the achievement of great reforms than the Irish\r\nparty. They are far beyond any similar group of English members in\r\nrhetorical skill and quickness of intelligence and decision, qualities\r\nwhich no doubt belong to the mechanism rather than the soul of politics,\r\nbut which the practical worker in public life will not despise. But even\r\nwhen tried by a higher standard the Irish members need not fear the\r\njudgment of history. They have often, in my opinion, misconceived the\r\ntrue interests of their country, but they have been faithful to those\r\ninterests as they understood them, and have proved themselves notably\r\nsuperior to sordid personal aims. These gifts and virtues are not\r\ncommon, but still rarer is it to see such gifts and virtues cursed with\r\nthe doom of futility. The influence of the Irish political leaders has\r\nneither advanced the nation's march through the wilderness nor taught\r\nthe people how they are to dispense with manna from above when they\r\nreach the Promised Land. With all their brilliancy, they have thrown but\r\nlittle helpful light on any Irish problem. In this want of political and\r\neconomic foresight Irish Nationalist politicians, with some exceptions\r\nwhom it would be invidious to name, have fallen lamentably short of what\r\nmight be expected of Irish intellect. For the eight years during which I\r\nrepresented an Irish constituency I always felt that an Irish night in\r\nthe House of Commons was one of the strangest and most pathetic of\r\nspectacles. There were the veterans of the Irish party hardened by a\r\nhundred fights, ranging from Venezuela to the Soudan in search of\r\nbattlefields, making allies of every kind of foreign potentate, from\r\nPresident Cleveland to the Mahdi, from Mr. Kruger to the Akhoom of Swat,\r\nbut looking with suspicion on every symptom of an independent national\r\nmovement in Ireland; masters of the language of hate and scorn, yet\r\nmocked by inevitable and eternal failure; winners of victories that turn\r\nto dust and ashes; devoted to their country, yet, from ignorance of the\r\nreal source of its malady, ever widening the gaping wound through which\r\nits life-blood flows. While I recall these scenes, there rises before my\r\nmind the picture vividly drawn by Miss Lawless of their prototypes, the\r\n'Wild Geese,' who carried their swords into foreign service after the\r\nfinal defeat of the Stuarts:--\r\n\r\n    War-battered dogs are we,\r\n    Fighters in every clime,\r\n    Fillers of trench and of grave,\r\n    Mockers, bemocked by Time;\r\n    War-dogs, hungry and grey,\r\n    Gnawing a naked bone,\r\n    Fighting in every clime\r\n    Every cause but our own.[15]\r\n\r\nIrishmen have been long in realising that the days of the 'Wild Geese'\r\nare over, and that there are battles for Ireland to be fought and won in\r\nIreland--battles in which England is not the enemy she was in the days\r\nof Fontenoy, but a friend and helper. But there will be little gain in\r\nreplacing the traditional conception of England as the inexorable foe by\r\nthe more modern conception, which threatened to become traditional in\r\nits turn, of England as the source of all prosperity and her favour as\r\nthe condition of all progress in Ireland. In the recent Land Conference\r\nI recognise something more valuable even than the financial and\r\nlegislative results which flowed from it, for it showed that the\r\nconception of reliance upon Irishmen in Ireland, not under some future\r\nand problematical conditions, but here and now, for the solution of\r\nIrish questions, is gaining ground among us. If this conception once\r\ntakes firm hold, as I think it is beginning to do, of the Nationalist\r\nparty in Ireland, much of the criticism of this chapter will lose its\r\nmeaning. The mere substitution of a positive Irish policy for a negative\r\nanti-English policy will elevate the whole range of Nationalist\r\npolitical activity in and out of Ireland. And I am certain that if the\r\nultimate goal of Nationalist politics be desirable, and continue to be\r\ndesired, it will not be rendered more difficult, but on the contrary\r\nvery much easier of attainment if those who seek it take possession of\r\nthe great field of work which, without waiting for any concessions from\r\nWestminster, is offered by the Ireland of to-day.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] This view of the case was powerfully stated by the deputation from\r\nthe Belfast Chamber of Commerce which waited on Mr. Gladstone in the\r\nspring of 1893. They pointed out _inter alia_ that the members of the\r\ndeputation were poorer by thousands of pounds owing to the fall in Irish\r\nstocks consequent upon the introduction of the Home Rule Bill in that\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n[12] The term 'Scotch-Irish' does not mean an amalgam of Scotch and\r\nIrish, but a race of Scottish immigrants who settled in north-east\r\nIreland. I may point out that in these criticisms of Irish-American\r\npolitics I refer, of course, mainly to the Irish-born immigrants and not\r\nto the Irish, Scotch-Irish or other, who are American-born. Nobody can\r\nhave a higher appreciation than I of the great part played by the\r\nAmerican-Irish once they have assimilated the full spirit of American\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n[13] _Poems of Egan O'Rahilly._ Edited, with translation, by the Rev.\r\nP.S.

By the way, there is a preface by Mr.\r\nStopford Brooke, which is singularly interesting and informing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCE OF RELIGION UPON SECULAR LIFE IN IRELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter I attempted to estimate the influence of our\r\npolitical leaders as a potential and as an actual force. I come now to\r\nthe second great influence upon the thought and action of the Irish\r\npeople, the influence of religion, especially the power exercised by the\r\npriests and by the unrivalled organisation of the Roman Catholic Church.\r\nI do not share the pessimism which sees in this potent influence nothing\r\nbut the shackles of mediævalism restraining its adherents from falling\r\ninto line with the progress of the age. I shall, indeed, have to admit\r\nmuch of what is charged against the clerical leaders of popular thought\r\nin Ireland, but I shall be able to show, I hope, that these leaders are\r\nlargely the product of a situation which they themselves did not create,\r\nand that not only are they as susceptible as are the political leaders\r\nto the influences of progressive movements, but that they can be more\r\nreadily induced to take part in their promotion. In no other country in\r\nthe world, probably, is religion so dominant an element in the daily\r\nlife of the people as in Ireland, and certainly nowhere else has the\r\nminister of religion so wide and undisputed an authority. It is obvious,\r\ntherefore, that, however foreign such a theme may _prima facie_ appear\r\nto the scope and aim of the present volume, I have no choice but to\r\nanalyse frankly and as fully as my personal experience justifies, what I\r\nconceive to be the true nature, the salutary limits, and the actual\r\nscope of clerical influence in this country.\r\n\r\nBut before I can discuss what I may call the religious situation, there\r\nis one fundamental question--a question which will appear somewhat\r\nstrange to anyone not in touch with Irish life--which I must, with a\r\nview to a general agreement on essentials, submit to some of my\r\nco-religionists. In all seriousness I would ask, whether in their\r\nopinion the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland is to be tolerated. If the\r\nanswer be in the negative, I can only reply that any efforts to stamp\r\nout the Roman Catholic faith would fail as they did in the past; and the\r\npractical minds among those I am now addressing must admit that in\r\ntoleration alone is to be found the solution of that part of the Irish\r\ndifficulty which is due to sectarian animosities.\r\n\r\nThis brings us face to face with the question, What is religious\r\ntoleration--I do not mean as a pious sentiment which we are all\r\nconscious of ourselves possessing in a truer sense than that in which it\r\nis possessed by others, but rather toleration as an essential of the\r\nliberty which we Protestants enjoy under the British Constitution, and\r\nboast that all other creeds equally enjoy? Perhaps I had better state\r\nsimply how I answer this question in my own mind. Toleration by the\r\nIrish minority, in regard to the religious faith and ecclesiastical\r\nsystem of the Irish majority, implies that we admit the right of Rome to\r\nsay what Roman Catholics shall believe and what outward forms they shall\r\nobserve, and that they shall not suffer before the State for these\r\nbeliefs and observances. I do not think exception can be taken to the\r\nstatement that toleration in this narrow sense cannot be refused\r\nconsistently with the fundamental principles of British government.\r\n\r\nNow, however, comes a less obvious, but, as I think, no less essential\r\ncondition of toleration in the sense above indicated. The Roman Catholic\r\nHierarchy claim the right to exercise such supervision and control over\r\nthe education of their flock as will enable them to safe-guard faith and\r\nmorals as preached and practised by their Church. I concede this second\r\nclaim as a necessary corollary of the first. Having lived most of my\r\nlife among Roman Catholics--two branches of my own family belonging to\r\nthat religion--I am aware that this control is an essential part of the\r\nwhole fabric of Roman Catholicism. Whether the basis of authority upon\r\nwhich that system is founded be in its origin divine or human is beside\r\nthe point. If we profess to tolerate the faith and religious system of\r\nthe majority of our countrymen we must at least concede the conditions\r\nessential to the maintenance of both the one and the other, unless our\r\ntolerance is to be a sham.\r\n\r\nSo far all liberal-minded Protestants, who know what Roman Catholicism\r\nis, will be with me; and for the main purposes of the argument contained\r\nin this chapter it is not necessary to interpret toleration in any wider\r\nsense than that which I have indicated. Many Protestants, among whom I\r\nam one, do, it is true, make a further concession to the claim of our\r\nRoman Catholic fellow-countrymen. We would give them in Ireland\r\nfacilities for higher education which we would not give them in England,\r\nand we would advocate liberal endowment by the State to this end. But\r\nthis attitude is, I admit, based upon something more than tolerance, and\r\nthose who would withhold this concession need not be accused of bigotry\r\nor intolerance for so doing. They may be, and often are, actuated by the\r\nmost liberal motives, by a perfectly legitimate conception of\r\neducational principles, or by other considerations which are neither of\r\na narrow nor sectarian character.\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that in criticising religious systems and their\r\nministers I have not the faintest intention of entering on the\r\ndiscussion of doctrinal issues. I am, of course, here concerned with\r\nonly those aspects of the religious situation which bear directly on\r\nsecular life. I am endeavouring, it must be remembered, to arrive at a\r\ncomprehensive and accurate appreciation of the chief influences which\r\nmould the character, guide the thought, and, therefore, direct the\r\naction of the Irish people as citizens of this world and of their own\r\ncountry. From this standpoint let us try to make a dispassionate survey\r\nof Protestantism and Roman Catholicism in Ireland, and see wherein\r\ntheir votaries fulfil, or fail to fulfil, their mission in advancing our\r\ncommon civilisation. Let us examine, in a word, not merely the direct\r\ninfluence which the creed of each of the two sections of Irishmen\r\nproduces on the industrial character of its adherents, but also its\r\nindirect effects upon the mutual relations and regard for each other of\r\nProtestants and Roman Catholics.\r\n\r\nProtestantism has its stronghold in the great industrial centres of the\r\nNorth and among the Presbyterian farmers of five or six Ulster counties.\r\nThese communities, it is significant to note, have developed the\r\nessentially strenuous qualities which, no doubt, they brought from\r\nEngland and Scotland. In city life their thrift, industry, and\r\nenterprise, unsurpassed in the United Kingdom, have built up a\r\nworld-wide commerce. In rural life they have drawn the largest yield\r\nfrom relatively infertile soil. Such, in brief, is the achievement of\r\nUlster Protestantism in the realm of industry. It is a story of which,\r\nwhen a united Ireland becomes more than a dream, all Irishmen will be\r\nproud.\r\n\r\nBut there is, unhappily, another side to the picture. This industrial\r\nlife, otherwise so worthily cultivated, is disturbed by manifestations\r\nof religious bigotry which sadly tarnish the glory of the really heroic\r\ndeeds they are intended to commemorate. It is impossible for any close\r\nobserver of these deplorable exhibitions to avoid the conclusion that\r\nthe embers of the old fires are too often fanned by men who are\r\nactuated by motives, which, when not other than religious, are certainly\r\nbased upon an unworthy conception of religion. I am quite aware that it\r\nis only a small and decreasing minority of my co-religionists who are\r\nopen to the charge of intolerance, and that the geographical limits of\r\nthe July orgy are now strictly circumscribed. But this bigotry is so\r\nnotorious, as for instance in the exclusion of Roman Catholics from many\r\nresponsible positions, that it unquestionably reacts most unfavourably\r\nupon the general relations between the two creeds throughout the whole\r\nof Ireland. The existence of such a spirit of suspicion and hatred, from\r\nwhatever motive it emanates, is bound to retard our progress as a people\r\ntowards the development of a healthy and balanced national life.\r\n\r\nMany causes have recently contributed to the unhappy continuance of\r\nsectarian animosities in Ireland. The Ritualistic movement and the\r\nstruggle over the Education Bill in England, the renewed controversy on\r\nthe University Question in Ireland, instances of bigotry towards\r\nProtestants displayed by County, District, and Urban Councils in the\r\nthree southern provinces of Ireland, the formation of the Catholic\r\nAssociation, the question of the form of the King's oath, and, more\r\nremotely, the protest against clericalism in such Roman Catholic\r\ncountries as France and Austria, have one and all helped to keep alive\r\nthe flame of anti-Roman feeling among Irish Protestants.[16]\r\n\r\nThere are, happily, other influences now at work in a contrary\r\ndirection. Among the industrial leaders a better spirit prevails. A\r\nwell-known Ulster manufacturer told me recently that only a few years\r\nago, when an applicant for employment appeared at certain Northern\r\nfactories, which my friend named, the first question always put was,\r\n'Are you a Protestant or Roman Catholic?' Now, he said, it is not what a\r\nman believes, but what he can do, which is considered when engaging\r\nworkers. And outside the cities there are most gratifying signs of\r\nbetter relations between the two creeds. We are on the eve of the\r\ncreation of a peasant proprietary, involving the rehabilitation of rural\r\nlife, and one essential condition of the successful inauguration of the\r\nnew agrarian order is the elimination of anything approaching to\r\nsectarian bitterness in communities which will require every advantage\r\nderivable from joint deliberation and common effort to enable them to\r\nhold their own against foreign competition. I recall a trivial but\r\nsignificant incident in the course of my Irish work which left a deep\r\nimpression on my mind. After attending a meeting of farmers in a very\r\nbackward district in the extreme west of Mayo, I arrived one winter's\r\nevening at the Roman Catholic priest's house. Before the meeting I had\r\nbeen promised a cup of tea, which, after a long, cold drive, was more\r\nthan acceptable. When I presented myself at the priest's house, what was\r\nmy astonishment at finding the Protestant clergyman presiding over a\r\nsteaming urn and a plate of home-made cakes, having been requested to do\r\nthe honours by his fellow-minister, who had been called away to a sick\r\nbed. A cycle of homilies on the virtue of tolerance could add nothing to\r\nthe simple lesson which these two clergymen gave to the adherents of\r\nboth their creeds. I felt as I went on my way that night that I had had\r\na glimpse into the kind of future for Ireland towards which my\r\nfellow-workers are striving.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, with the religion of the majority of the Irish people\r\nand with its influence upon the industrial character of its adherents\r\nthat I am chiefly concerned. Roman Catholicism strikes an outsider as\r\nbeing in some of its tendencies non-economic, if not actually\r\nanti-economic. These tendencies have, of course, much fuller play when\r\nthey act on a people whose education has (through no fault of their own)\r\nbeen retarded or stunted. The fact is not in dispute, but the difficulty\r\narises when we come to apportion the blame between ignorance on the part\r\nof the people and a somewhat one-sided religious zeal on the part of\r\nlarge numbers of their clergy. I do not seek to do so with any precision\r\nhere. I am simply adverting to what has appeared to me, in the course of\r\nmy experience in Ireland, to be a defect in the industrial character of\r\nRoman Catholics which, however caused, seems to me to have been\r\nintensified by their religion. The reliance of that religion on\r\nauthority, its repression of individuality, and its complete shifting of\r\nwhat I may call the moral centre of gravity to a future existence--to\r\nmention no other characteristics--appear to me calculated, unless\r\nsupplemented by other influences, to check the growth of the qualities\r\nof initiative and self-reliance, especially amongst a people whose lack\r\nof education unfits them for resisting the influence of what may present\r\nitself to such minds as a kind of fatalism with resignation as its\r\nparamount virtue.\r\n\r\nIt is true that one cannot expect of any church or religion, as a\r\ncondition of its acceptance, that it will furnish an economic theory;\r\nand it is also true that Roman Catholicism has, at different periods of\r\nhistory, advantageously affected economic conditions, even if it did not\r\nact from distinctively economic motives--for example, by its direct\r\ninfluence in the suppression of slavery[17] and its creation of the\r\nmediæval craft guilds. It may, too, be admitted that during the Middle\r\nAges, when Roman Catholicism was freer than now to manifest its\r\ninfluence in many directions, owing to its practically unchallenged\r\nsupremacy, it favoured, when it did not originate, many forms of sound\r\neconomic activity, and was, to say the least, abreast of the time in its\r\nconception of the working of economic causes. But from the time when\r\nthe Reformation, by its demand for what we Protestants conceive to be a\r\nsimpler Christianity, drove Roman Catholicism back, if I may use the\r\nexpression, on its first line of defence, and constrained it to look to\r\nits distinctively spiritual heritage, down to the present day, it has\r\nseemed to stand strangely aloof from any contact with industrial and\r\neconomic issues. When we consider that in this period Adam Smith lived\r\nand died, the industrial revolution was effected, and the world-market\r\nopened, it is not surprising that we do not find Roman Catholic\r\ncountries in the van of economic progress, or even the Roman Catholic\r\nelement in Protestant countries, as a rule, abreast of their\r\nfellow-countrymen. It would, however, be an error to ignore some notable\r\nexceptions to this generalisation. In Belgium, in France, in parts of\r\nGermany and Austria, and in the north of Italy economic thought is\r\nmaking headway amongst Roman Catholics, and the solution of social\r\nproblems is being advanced by Roman Catholic laymen and clergymen. Even\r\nin these countries, however, much remains to be done. The revolution in\r\nthe industrial order, and its consequences, such as the concentration of\r\nimmense populations within restricted areas, have brought with them\r\nsocial and moral evils that must be met with new weapons. In the\r\ninterests of religion itself, principles first expounded to a Syrian\r\ncommunity with the most elementary physical needs and the simplest of\r\navocations, have to be taught in their application to the conditions of\r\nthe most complex social organisation and economic life. Taking people\r\nas we find them, it may be said with truth that their lives must be\r\nwholesome before they can be holy, and while a voluntary asceticism may\r\nhave its justification, it behoves a Church to see that its members,\r\nwhile fully acknowledging the claims of another life, should develop the\r\nqualities which make for well-being in this life. In fact, I believe\r\nthat the influence of Christianity upon social progress will be best\r\nmaintained by co-ordinating these spiritual and economic ideals in a\r\nphilosophy of life broader and truer than any to which the nations have\r\nyet attained.\r\n\r\nWhat I have just been saying with regard to Roman Catholicism generally,\r\nin relation to economic doctrines and industrial progress, applies, of\r\ncourse, with a hundred fold pertinence to the case of Ireland. Between\r\nthe enactment of the first Penal Laws and the date of Roman Catholic\r\nEmancipation, Irish Roman Catholics were, to put it mildly, afforded\r\nscant opportunity, in their own country, of developing economic virtues\r\nor achieving industrial success. Ruthlessly deprived of education, are\r\nthey to be blamed if they did not use the newly acquired facilities to\r\nthe best advantage? With their religion looked on as the badge of legal\r\nand social inferiority, was it any wonder that priests and people alike,\r\nwhile clinging with unexampled fidelity to their creed, remained\r\naltogether cut off from the current of material prosperity? Excluded, as\r\nthey were, not merely from social and political privileges, but from the\r\nmost ordinary civil rights, denied altogether the right of ownership of\r\nreal property, and restricted in the possession of personalty, is it\r\nany wonder that they are not to-day in the van of industrial and\r\ncommercial progress? Nay, more, was it to have been expected that the\r\ncharacter of a people so persecuted and ostracised should have come out\r\nof the ordeal of centuries with its adaptability and elasticity\r\nunimpaired? That would have been impossible. Those who are intimate with\r\nthe Roman Catholic people of Ireland, and at the same time familiar with\r\ntheir history, will recognise in their character and mental outlook many\r\nan inheritance of that epoch of serfdom. I speak, of course, of the\r\nmass, for I am not unmindful of many exceptions to this generalisation.\r\n\r\nBut I must now pass on to a more definite consideration of the present\r\naction and attitude of the Irish Roman Catholic clergy towards the\r\neconomic, educational, and other issues discussed in this book. The\r\nreasons which render such a consideration necessary are obvious. Even if\r\nwe include Ulster, three quarters of the Irish people are Roman\r\nCatholics, while, excluding the Northern province, quite nine-tenths of\r\nthe population belong to that religion. Again, the three thousand\r\nclergymen of that denomination exercise an influence over their flocks\r\nnot merely in regard to religious matters, but in almost every phase of\r\ntheir lives and conduct, which is, in its extent and character, quite\r\nunique, even, I should say, amongst Roman Catholic communities. To a\r\nProtestant, this authority seems to be carried very far beyond what the\r\nlegitimate influence of any clergy over the lay members of their\r\ncongregation should be. We are, however, dealing with a national life\r\nexplicable only by reference to a very exceptional and gloomy history of\r\nreligious persecution. What I may call the secular shortcomings of the\r\nRoman Catholics in Ireland cannot be fairly judged except as the results\r\nof a series of enactments by which they were successively denied almost\r\nall means of succeeding as citizens of this world.\r\n\r\nFrom such study as I have been able to give to the history of their\r\nChurch, I have come to the conclusion that the immense power of the\r\nIrish Roman Catholic clergy has been singularly little abused. I think\r\nit must be admitted that they have not exhibited in any marked degree\r\nbigotry towards Protestants. They have not put obstacles in the way of\r\nthe Roman Catholic majority choosing Protestants for political leaders,\r\nand it is significant that refugees, such as the Palatines, from\r\nCatholic persecutions in Europe, found at different times a home amongst\r\nthe Roman Catholic people of Ireland. My own experience, too, if I may\r\nagain refer to that, distinctly proves that it is no disadvantage to a\r\nman to be a Protestant in Irish political life, and that where\r\nopposition is shown to him by Roman Catholics it is almost invariably on\r\npolitical, social, or agrarian, but not on religious grounds.\r\n\r\nA charge of another kind has of late been often brought against the\r\nRoman Catholic clergy, which has a direct bearing upon the economic\r\naspect of this question. Although, as I read Irish history, the Roman\r\nCatholic priesthood have, in the main, used their authority with\r\npersonal disinterestedness, if not always with prudence or discretion,\r\ntheir undoubted zeal for religion has, on occasion, assumed forms which\r\nenlightened Roman Catholics, including high dignitaries of that Church,\r\nthink unjustifiable on economic grounds, and discourage even from a\r\nreligious standpoint. Excessive and extravagant church-building in the\r\nheart and at the expense of poor communities is a recent and notorious\r\nexample of this misdirected zeal. It has been, I believe, too often\r\nforgotten that the best monument of any clergyman's influence and\r\nearnestness must always be found in the moral character and the\r\nspiritual fibre of his flock, and not in the marbles and mosaics of a\r\ngaudy edifice. And without doubt a good many motives which have but a\r\nremote connection with religion are, unfortunately, at work in the\r\nchurch-building movement. It may, however, to some extent, be regarded\r\nas an extreme re-action from the penal times, when the hunted _soggarth_\r\nhad to celebrate the Mass in cabins and caves on the mountain side--a\r\nre-action the converse of which was witnessed in Protestant England when\r\nPuritanism rose up against Anglicanism in the seventeenth century. This\r\nexpenditure, however, has been incurred; and, no one, I take it, would\r\nadvocate the demolition of existing religious edifices on the ground\r\nthat their erection had been unduly costly! The moral is for the present\r\nand the future, and applies not merely to economy in new buildings, but\r\nalso in the decoration of existing churches.[18]\r\n\r\nBut it is not alone extravagant church building which in a country so\r\nbackward as Ireland, shocks the economic sense. The multiplication--in\r\ninverse ratio to a declining population--of costly and elaborate\r\nmonastic and conventual institutions, involving what in the aggregate\r\nmust be an enormous annual expenditure for maintenance, is difficult to\r\nreconcile with the known conditions of the country. Most of these\r\ninstitutions, it is true, carry on educational work, often, as in the\r\ncase of the Christian Brothers and some colleges and convents, of an\r\nexcellent kind. Many of them render great services to the poor, and\r\nespecially to the sick poor. But, none the less, it seems to me, their\r\ngrowth in number and size is anomalous. I cannot believe that so large\r\nan addition to the 'unproductive' classes is economically sound, and I\r\nhave no doubt at all that the competition with lay teachers of celibates\r\n'living in community' is excessive and educationally injurious. Strongly\r\nas I hold the importance of religion in education, I personally do not\r\nthink that teachers who have renounced the world and withdrawn from\r\ncontact with its stress and strain are the best moulders of the\r\ncharacters of youths who will have to come into direct conflict with the\r\ntrials and temptations of life. But here again we must accept the\r\nsituation and work with the instruments ready to hand. The practical and\r\nstatesmanlike action for all those concerned is to endeavour to render\r\nthese institutions as efficient educational agencies as may be possible.\r\nThey owe their existence largely to the gaps in the educational system\r\nof this country which religious and political strife have produced and\r\nmaintained, and they deserve the utmost credit for endeavouring to\r\nsupply missing steps in our educational ladder.[19] If they now fully\r\nrespond to the spirit of the new movements and meet the demand for\r\ntechnical education by the employment of the most approved methods and\r\nequipment, and by the thorough training on sound lines of their staffs,\r\nit is impossible that their influence on the young generation should not\r\nbe as salutary as it will be wide-reaching.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, these criticisms are, for the purposes of my argument,\r\nof minor relevance and importance. The real matter in which the direct\r\nand personal responsibility of the Roman Catholic clergy seems to me to\r\nbe involved, is the character and _morale_ of the people of this\r\ncountry. No reader of this book will accuse me of attaching too little\r\nweight to the influence of historical causes on the present state,\r\nsocial, economic and political, of Ireland, but even when I have given\r\nfull consideration to all such influences I still think that, with their\r\nunquestioned authority in religion, and their almost equally undisputed\r\ninfluence in education, the Roman Catholic clergy cannot be exonerated\r\nfrom some responsibility in regard to Irish character as we find it\r\nto-day. Are they, I would ask, satisfied with that character? I cannot\r\nthink so. The impartial observer will, I fear, find amongst a majority\r\nof our people a striking absence of self-reliance and moral courage; an\r\nentire lack of serious thought on public questions; a listlessness and\r\napathy in regard to economic improvement which amount to a form of\r\nfatalism; and, in backward districts, a survival of superstition, which\r\nsaps all strength of will and purpose--and all this, too, amongst a\r\npeople singularly gifted by nature with good qualities of mind and\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nNor can the Roman Catholic clergy altogether console themselves with the\r\nthought that religious faith, even when free from superstition, is\r\nstrong in the breasts of the people. So long, no doubt, as Irish Roman\r\nCatholics remain at home, in a country of sharply defined religious\r\nclasses, and with a social environment and a public opinion so\r\npreponderatingly stamped with their creed, open defections from Roman\r\nCatholicism are rare. But we have only to look at the extent of the\r\n'leakage' from Roman Catholicism amongst the Irish emigrants in the\r\nUnited States and in Great Britain, to realise how largely emotional and\r\nformal must be the religion of those who lapse so quickly in a\r\nnon-Catholic atmosphere.[20]\r\n\r\nIt is not, of course, to the causes of the defections from a creed to\r\nwhich I do not subscribe that my criticism is directed. I refer to the\r\nmatter only in order to emphasise the large share of responsibility\r\nwhich belongs to the Roman Catholic clergy for what I strongly believe\r\nto be the chief part in the work of national regeneration, the part\r\ncompared with which all legislative, administrative, educational or\r\nindustrial achievements are of minor importance. Holding, as I do, that\r\nthe building of character is the condition precedent to material, social\r\nand intellectual advancement, indeed to all national progress, I may,\r\nperhaps, as a lay citizen, more properly criticise, from this point of\r\nview, what I conceive to be the great defect in the methods of clerical\r\ninfluence. For this purpose no better illustration could be afforded\r\nthan a brief analysis of the results of the efforts made by the Roman\r\nCatholic clergy to inculcate temperance.\r\n\r\nAmong temperance advocates--the most earnest of all reformers--the Roman\r\nCatholic clergy have an honourable record. An Irish priest was the\r\ngreatest, and, for a brief spell, the most successful temperance apostle\r\nof the last century, and statistics, it is only fair to say, show that\r\nwe Irish drink rather less than people in other parts of the United\r\nKingdom. But the real question is whether we more often drink to\r\nintoxication, and police statistics as well as common experience seem to\r\ndisclose that we do. Many a temperate man drinks more in his life than\r\nmany a village drunkard. Again, the test of the average consumption of\r\nman, woman and child is somewhat misleading, especially in Ireland\r\nwhere, owing to the excessive emigration of adults, there is a\r\ndisproportionately large number of very young and old. Moreover, we\r\nIrish drink more in proportion to our means than the English, Scotch,\r\nand Welsh, whose consumption is absolutely larger. Anyone who attempts\r\nto deal practically with the problems of industrial development in\r\nIreland realises what a terribly depressing influence the drink evil\r\nexercises upon the industrial capacity of the people. 'Ireland sober is\r\nIreland free,' is nearer the truth, than much that is thought and most\r\nof what is said about liberty in this country.\r\n\r\nNow, the drink habit in Ireland differs from that of the other parts of\r\nthe United Kingdom. The Irishman is, in my belief, physiologically less\r\nsubject to the craving for alcohol than the Englishman, a fact which is\r\npartially attributable, I should say, to the less animal dietary to\r\nwhich he is accustomed. By far the greater proportion of the drinking\r\nwhich retards our progress is of a festive character. It takes place at\r\nfairs and markets, sometimes, even yet, at 'wakes,' those ghastly\r\nparodies on the blessed consolation of religion in bereavement. It is\r\nintensified by the almost universal sale of liquor in the country shops\r\n'for consumption on the premises,' an evil the demoralising effects of\r\nwhich are an hundredfold greater than those of the 'grocer's licences'\r\nwhich temperance reformers so strenuously denounce. It is an evil in\r\ndefence of which nothing can be said, but it has somehow escaped the\r\neffective censure of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe indiscriminate granting of licences in Ireland, which has resulted\r\nin the provision of liquor shops in a proportion to the population\r\nlarger than is found in any other country, is in itself due mainly to\r\nthe moral cowardice of magistrates, who do not care to incur local\r\nunpopularity by refusing licences for which there is no pretence of any\r\nneed beyond that of the applicant and his relatives. Not long ago the\r\nmagistrates of Ireland met in Dublin in order to inaugurate common\r\naction in dealing with this scandal. Appropriate resolutions were\r\npassed, and much good has already resulted from the meeting, but had the\r\nunvarnished truth been admissible, the first and indeed the only\r\nnecessary resolution should have run, \"Resolved that in future we be\r\ncollectively as brave as we have been individually timid, and that we\r\ntake heart of grace and carry away from this meeting sufficient strength\r\nto do, in the exercise of our functions as the licensing authority, what\r\nwe have always known to be our plain duty to our country and our God.\"\r\nNo such resolution was proposed, for though patriotism is becoming real\r\nin Ireland, it is not yet very robust.\r\n\r\nI do not think it unfair to insist upon the large responsibility of the\r\nclergy for the state of public opinion in this matter, to which the few\r\nfacts I have cited bear testimony. But I attribute their failure to deal\r\nwith a moral evil of which they are fully cognisant to the fact that\r\nthey do not recognise the chief defect in the character of the people,\r\nand to a misunderstanding of the means by which that character can be\r\nstrengthened. There are, however, exceptions to this general statement.\r\nIt is of happy augury for the future of Ireland that many of the clergy\r\nare now leading a temperance movement which shows a real knowledge of\r\nthe _causa causans_ of Irish intemperance. The Anti-Treating League, as\r\nit is called, administers a novel pledge which must have been conceived\r\nin a very understanding mind. Those enlisted undertake neither to treat\r\nnor to be treated. They may drink, so far as the pledge is concerned, as\r\nmuch as they like; but they must drink at their own expense; and others\r\nmust not drink at their expense. The good nature and sociability of\r\nIrishmen, too often the mere result of inability to say 'no,' need not\r\nbe sacrificed. But even if they were, the loss of these social graces\r\nwould be far more than compensated by a self-respect and seriousness of\r\nlife out of which something permanent might be built. Still, even this\r\nLeague makes no direct appeal to character, and so acts rather as a cure\r\nfor than as a preventive of our moral weakness.\r\n\r\nThe methods by which clerical influence is wielded in the inculcation of\r\nchastity may be criticised from exactly the same standpoint as that from\r\nwhich I have found it necessary to deal with the question of temperance.\r\nHere the success of the Irish priesthood is, considering the conditions\r\nof peasant life, and the fire of the Celtic temperament, absolutely\r\nunique. No one can deny that almost the entire credit of this moral\r\nachievement belongs to the Roman Catholic clergy. It may be said that\r\nthe practice of a virtue, even if the motive be of an emotional kind,\r\nbecomes a habit, and that habit proverbially develops into a second\r\nnature. With this view of moral evolution I am in entire accord; but I\r\nwould ask whether the evolution has not reached a stage where a gradual\r\nrelaxation of the disciplinary measures by which chastity is insured\r\nmight be safely allowed without any danger of lowering the high standard\r\nof continence which is general in Ireland and which of course it is of\r\nsupreme importance to maintain.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, many parishes where in this matter the strictest\r\ndiscipline is rigorously enforced Amusements, not necessarily or even\r\noften vicious, are objected to as being fraught with dangers which would\r\nnever occur to any but the rigidly ascetic or the puritanical mind. In\r\nmany parishes the Sunday cyclist will observe the strange phenomenon of\r\na normally light-hearted peasantry marshalled in male and female groups\r\nalong the road, eyeing one another in dull wonderment across the\r\nforbidden space through the long summer day. This kind of discipline,\r\nunless when really necessary, is open to the objection that it\r\neliminates from the education of life, especially during the formative\r\nyears, an essential of culture--the mutual understanding of the sexes.\r\nThe evil of grafting upon secular life a quasi-monasticism which, not\r\nbeing voluntary, has no real effect upon the character, may perhaps\r\ninvolve moral consequences little dreamed of by the spiritual guardians\r\nof the people. A study of the pathology of the emotions might throw\r\ndoubt upon the safety of enforced asceticism when unaccompanied by the\r\ntraining which the Church wisely prescribes for those who take the vow\r\nof celibacy. But of my own knowledge I can speak only of another aspect\r\nof the effect upon our national life of the restrictions to which I\r\nrefer. No Irishmen are more sincerely desirous of staying the tide of\r\nemigration than the Roman Catholic clergy, and while, wisely as I think,\r\nthey do not dream of a wealthy Ireland, they earnestly work for the\r\nphysical and material as well as the spiritual well-being of their\r\nflocks. And yet no man can get into the confidence of the emigrating\r\nclasses without being told by them that the exodus is largely due to a\r\nfeeling that the clergy are, no doubt from an excellent motive, taking\r\njoy--innocent joy--from the social side of the home life.\r\n\r\nTo go more fully into these subjects might carry me beyond the proper\r\nlimits of lay criticism. But, clearly, large questions of clerical\r\ntraining must suggest themselves to those to whom their discussion\r\nproperly belongs--whether, for example, there is not in the instances\r\nwhich I have cited evidence of a failure to understand that mere\r\nauthority in the regions of moral conduct cannot have any abiding\r\neffect, except in the rarest combination of circumstances, and with a\r\nvery primitive people. Do not many of these clergy ignore the vast\r\ndifference between the ephemeral nature of moral compulsion and the\r\nenduring force of a real moral training?\r\n\r\nI have dealt with the exercise of clerical influence in these matters as\r\nbeing, at any rate in relation to the subject matter of this book, far\r\nmore important than the evil commonly described as \"The Priest in\r\nPolitics.\" That evil is, in my opinion, greatly misrepresented. The\r\ncases of priests who take an improper part in politics are cited without\r\nreference to the vastly greater number who take no part at all, except\r\nwhen genuinely assured that a definite moral issue is at stake. I also\r\nhave in my mind the question of how we should have fared if the control\r\nof the different Irish agitations had been confined to laymen, and if\r\nthe clergy had not consistently condemned secret associations. But\r\nwhatever may be said in defence of the priest in politics in the past,\r\nthere are the strongest grounds for deprecating a continuance of their\r\npolitical activity in the future. As I gauge the several forces now\r\noperating in Ireland, I am convinced that if an anti-clerical movement\r\nsimilar to that which other Roman Catholic countries have witnessed,\r\nwere to succeed in discrediting the priesthood and lowering them in\r\npublic estimation, it would be followed by a moral, social, and\r\npolitical degradation which would blight, or at least postpone, our\r\nhopes of a national regeneration. From this point of view I hold that\r\nthose clergymen who are predominantly politicians endanger the moral\r\ninfluence which it is their solemn duty to uphold. I believe however,\r\nthat the over-active part hitherto taken in politics by the priests is\r\nlargely the outcome of the way in which Roman Catholics were treated in\r\nthe past, and that this undesirable feature in Irish life will yield,\r\nand is already yielding to the removal of the evils to which it owed its\r\norigin and in some measure its justification.[21]\r\n\r\nOne has only to turn to the spirit and temper of such representative\r\nRoman Catholics as Archbishop Healy and Dr. Kelly, Bishop of Ross--to\r\ntheir words and to their deeds--in order to catch the inspiration of a\r\nnew movement amongst our Roman Catholic fellow-countrymen at once\r\nreligious and patriotic. And if my optimism ever wavers, I have but to\r\nthink of the noble work that many priests are to my own knowledge\r\ndoing, often in remote and obscure parishes, in the teeth of innumerable\r\nobstacles. I call to mind at such times, as pioneers in a great\r\nawakening, men like the eminent Jesuit, Father Thomas Finlay, Father\r\nHegarty of Erris, Father O'Donovan of Loughrea, and many others--men\r\nwith whom I have worked and taken counsel, and who represent, I believe,\r\nan ever increasing number of their fellow priests.[22]\r\n\r\nMy position, then, towards the influence of the Roman Catholic\r\nclergy--and this influence is a matter of vital importance to the\r\nunderstanding of Irish problems--- may now be clearly defined. While\r\nrecognising to the full that large numbers of the Irish Roman Catholic\r\nclergy have in the past exercised undue influence in purely political\r\nquestions, and, in many other matters, social, educational, and\r\neconomic, have not, as I see things, been on the side of progress, I\r\nhold that their influence is now, more than ever before, essential for\r\nimproving the condition of the most backward section of the population.\r\nTherefore I feel it to be both the duty and the strong interest of my\r\nProtestant fellow-countrymen to think much less of the religious\r\ndifferences which divide them from Roman Catholics, and much more of\r\ntheir common citizenship and their common cause. I also hold with equal\r\nstrength and sincerity to the belief, which I have already expressed,\r\nthat the shortcomings of the Roman Catholic clergy are largely to be\r\naccounted for, not by any innate tendency on their part towards\r\nobscurantism, but by the sad history of Ireland in the past. I would\r\nappeal to those of my co-religionists who think otherwise to suspend\r\ntheir judgment for a time. That Roman Catholicism is firmly established\r\nin Ireland is a fact of the situation which they must admit, and as this\r\ninvolves the continued powerful influence of the priesthood upon the\r\ncharacter of the people, it is surely good policy by liberality and fair\r\ndealing, especially in the matter of education, to turn this influence\r\ntowards the upbuilding of our national life.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the influence of religion and religious controversy in\r\nIreland, as it presents itself from the only standpoint from which I\r\nhave approached the matter in this chapter, namely, that of material,\r\nsocial, and intellectual progress, I find that while the Protestants\r\nhave given, and continue to give, a fine example of thrift and industry\r\nto the rest of the nation, the attitude of a section of them towards the\r\nmajority of their fellow-countrymen has been a bigoted and unintelligent\r\none. On the other hand, I have learned from practical experience amongst\r\nthe Roman Catholic people of Ireland that, while more free from bigotry,\r\nin the sense in which that word is usually applied, they are apathetic,\r\nthriftless, and almost non-industrial, and that they especially require\r\nthe exercise of strengthening influences on their moral fibre. I have\r\ndealt with their shortcomings at much greater length than with those of\r\nProtestants, because they have much more bearing on the subject matter\r\nof this book. North and South have each virtues which the other lacks;\r\neach has much to learn from the other; but the home of the strictly\r\ncivic virtues and efficiencies is in Protestant Ireland. The work of the\r\nfuture in Ireland will be to break down in social intercourse the\r\nbarriers of creed as well as those of race, politics, and class, and\r\nthus to promote the fruitful contact of North and South, and the\r\nconcentration of both on the welfare of their common country. In the\r\ncase of those of us, of whatever religious belief, who look to a future\r\nfor our country commensurate with the promise of her undeveloped\r\nresources both of intellect and soil, it is of the essence of our hope\r\nthat the qualities which are in great measure accountable for the actual\r\neconomic and educational backwardness of so many of our\r\nfellow-countrymen, and for the intolerance of too many who are not\r\nbackward in either respect, are not purely racial or sectarian, but are\r\nthe transitory growth of days and deeds which we must all try to forget\r\nif our work for Ireland is to endure.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] The reproach which is brought upon Irish Christianity mainly by the\r\nextravagances of a section of my co-religionists, to which I have been\r\nobliged to refer, came home to me not long ago in a very forcible way. I\r\nhappened to remark to a friend that it was a disgrace to Christianity\r\nthat Mussulman soldiery were employed at the Holy Sepulchre to keep the\r\npeace between the Latin and Greek Christians. He reminded me that the\r\nprosperous and progressive municipality of Belfast, with a population\r\neminently industrious, and predominantly Protestant, has to be policed\r\nby an Imperial force in order to restrain two sections of Irish\r\nChristians from assaulting each other in the name of religion.\r\n\r\n[17] '_Pro salute animae meae_' was, I am reminded, the consideration\r\nusually expressed in the old charters of manumission.\r\n\r\n[18] One of the unfortunate effects of this passion for building costly\r\nchurches is the importation of quantities of foreign art-work in the\r\nshape of woodcarvings, stained glass, mosaics, and metal work. To good\r\nforeign art, indeed, one could not, within certain limits, object. It\r\nmight prove a valuable example and stimulus. But the articles which have\r\nactually been imported, in the impulse to get everything finished as\r\nsoon as possible, generally consist of the stock pieces produced in a\r\nspirit of mere commercialism in the workshops of Continental firms which\r\nmake it their business to cater for a public who do not know the\r\ndifference between good art and bad. Much of the decoration of\r\necclesiastical buildings, whether Roman Catholic or Protestant, might\r\nfittingly be postponed until religion in Ireland has got into closer\r\nrelation with the native artistic sense and industrial spirit now\r\nbeginning to seek creative expression.\r\n\r\n[19] The following extract from a statement of the Most Rev. Dr. O'Dea,\r\nthe newly elected Bishop of Clonfert, is pertinent:--'There is another\r\ncause also--i.e. in addition to the absence of university education for\r\nRoman Catholic laymen--which has hindered the employment of the laity in\r\nthe past. Till very recently, the secondary Catholic schools received no\r\nassistance whatever from the State, and their endowment from private\r\nsources was utterly inadequate to supply suitable remuneration for lay\r\nteachers. It is evident that a celibate clergy _can_ live on a lower\r\nwage than the laity, and they are now charged with having monopolized\r\nthe schools, because they chose to work for a minimum allowance rather\r\nthan suffer the country to remain without any secondary education\r\nwhatever. Two causes, then, operated in the past, and in a large measure\r\nstill operate, to exclude the laity from the secondary schools,--first,\r\nthese schools were so poverty-stricken that they could not afford to pay\r\nlay teachers at such a rate as would attract them to the teaching\r\nprofession, and, next, the Catholic laity as a body were uneducated,\r\nand, therefore, unfit to teach in the schools.'--_Maynooth and the\r\nUniversity Question_, p. 109 (footnote).\r\n\r\n[20] See, _inter alia_, an article \"Ireland and America,\" by Rev. Mr.\r\nShinnors, O.M., in the _Irish Ecclesiastical Record_, February, 1902.\r\n'Has the Church,' asks Father Shinnors, 'increased her membership in the\r\nratio that the population of the United States has increased? No. There\r\nare many converts, but there are many more apostates. Large numbers\r\nlapse into indifferentism and irreligion. There should be in America\r\nabout 20,000,000 Catholics; there are scarcely 10,000,000. There are\r\nreasons to fear that the great majority of the apostates are of Irish\r\nextraction, and not a few of them of Irish birth.'\r\n\r\n[21] This view seems to be taken by the most influential spokesmen of\r\nthe Roman Catholic Hierarchy. See Evidence, _Royal Commission on\r\nUniversity Education in Ireland_, vol. iii., p. 238, Questions 8702-6.\r\n\r\n[22] I may mention that of the co-operative societies organised by the\r\nIrish Agricultural Organisation Society there are no fewer than 331\r\nsocieties of which the local priests are the Chairmen, while to my own\r\nknowledge during the summer and autumn of 1902, as many as 50,000\r\npersons from all parts of Ireland were personally conducted over the\r\nexhibit of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction at\r\nthe Cork Exhibition by their local clergy. The educational purpose of\r\nthese visits is explained in Chap. x. Again, in a great number of cases\r\nthe village libraries which have been recently started in Ireland with\r\nthe assistance of the Department (the books consisting largely of\r\nindustrial, economic, and technical works on agriculture), have been\r\norganised and assisted by the Roman Catholic clergy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nA PRACTICAL VIEW OF IRISH EDUCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nA little learning, we are told, is a dangerous thing; and in their\r\ndealings with Irish education the English should have discovered that\r\nthis danger is accentuated when the little learning is combined with\r\nmuch native wit. In the days when religious persecution was\r\nuniversal--only, be it remembered, a few generations ago--it was the\r\npolicy of England to avert this danger by prohibiting, as far as\r\npossible, the acquisition by Irish Roman Catholics of any learning at\r\nall. After the Union, Englishmen began to feel their responsibility for\r\nthe state of Ireland, a state of poverty and distress which culminated\r\nin the Famine. Knowledge was then no longer withheld: indeed the English\r\nsincerely desired to dispel our darkness and enable us to share in the\r\nwisdom, and so in the prosperity, of the predominant partner. In their\r\nattempts to educate us they dealt with what they saw on the surface, and\r\nmoulded their educational principles upon what they knew; but they did\r\nnot know Ireland. Even if we excuse them for paying scant attention to\r\nwhat they were told by Irishmen, they should have given more heed to the\r\nreports of their own Royal Commissions.\r\n\r\nWe have so far seen that the Irish mind has been in regard to\r\neconomics, politics, and even some phases of religious influence, a mind\r\nwarped and diseased, deprived of good nutrition and fed on fancies or\r\nfictions, out of which no genuine growth, industrial or other, was\r\npossible. The one thing that might have strengthened and saved a people\r\nwith such a political, social, and religious history, and such racial\r\ncharacteristics, was an educational system which would have had special\r\nregard to that history, and which would have been a just expression of\r\nthe better mind of the people whom it was intended to serve.\r\n\r\nNow this is exactly what was denied to Ireland. Not merely has all\r\neducational legislation come from England, in the sense of being based\r\non English models and thought out by Englishmen largely out of touch and\r\nsympathy with the peculiar needs of Ireland, but whenever there has been\r\ngenuine native thought on Irish educational problems, it has been either\r\nignored altogether or distorted till its value and significance were\r\nlost. And in this matter we can claim for Ireland that there was in the\r\ncountry during the first half of the nineteenth century, when England\r\nwas trying her best to provide us with a sound English education, a\r\ncomparatively advanced stage of home-grown Irish thought upon the\r\neducational needs of the people. Take, for example, the Society for\r\nPromoting Elementary Education among the Irish Poor, know as the Kildare\r\nStreet Society, which was founded as early as the year 1811. The first\r\nresolution passed by this body, which was composed of prominent Dublin\r\ncitizens of all religious beliefs, was set out as follows:--\r\n\r\n     (1.) Resolved--That promoting the education of the poor of Ireland\r\n     is a grand object which every Irishman anxious for the welfare and\r\n     prosperity of his country ought to have in view as the basis upon\r\n     which the morals and true happiness of the country can be best\r\n     secured.\r\n\r\nThis Society, it is true, did not see or foresee that any system of\r\nmixed religious education was doomed to failure in Ireland, but they\r\ntook a wide view of the place of education in a nation's development,\r\nand the character of the education which their schools actually\r\ndispensed was admirable. This hopeful and enterprising educational\r\nmovement is described by Mr. Lecky in a passage from which I take a few\r\nextracts:--\r\n\r\n     The \"Kildare Street Society\" which received an endowment from\r\n     Government, and directed National education from 1812 to 1831, was\r\n     not proselytising, and it was for some time largely patronized by\r\n     Roman Catholics. It is certainly by no means deserving of the\r\n     contempt which some writers have bestowed on it, and if measured by\r\n     the spirit of the time in which it was founded it will appear both\r\n     liberal and useful.... The object of the schools was stated to be\r\n     united education, \"taking common Christian ground for the\r\n     foundation, and excluding all sectarian distinctions from every\r\n     part of the arrangement;\" \"drawing the attention of both\r\n     denominations to the many leading truths of Christianity in which\r\n     they agree.\" To carry out this principle it was a fundamental rule\r\n     that the Bible must be read without note or comment in all the\r\n     schools. It might be read either in the Authorized or in the Douay\r\n     version.... In 1825 there were 1,490 schools connected with the\r\n     Society, containing about 100,000 pupils. The improvements\r\n     introduced into education by Bell, Lancaster, and Pestalozzi were\r\n     largely adopted. Great attention was paid to needlework.... A great\r\n     number of useful publications were printed by the Society, and we\r\n     have the high authority of Dr. Doyle for stating that he never\r\n     found anything objectionable [to Catholics] in them.[23]\r\n\r\nTake, again, as an evidence of the progressive spirit of the Irish\r\nthinkers on education, the remarkable scheme of national education\r\nwhich, after the passing of the Catholic Emancipation Act, was\r\nformulated by Mr. Thomas Wyse, of Waterford. In addition to elementary\r\nschools, Mr. Wyse proposed to establish in every county, 'an academy for\r\nthe education of the middle class of society in those departments of\r\nknowledge most necessary to those classes, and over those a College in\r\neach of the four provinces, managed by a Committee representative of the\r\ninterests of the several counties of the provinces.' 'It is a matter of\r\nimportance,' wrote Mr. Wyse, 'for the simple and efficient working of\r\nthe whole system of national education, that each part should as much as\r\npossible be brought into co-operation and accord with the others.' He\r\nforesaw, too, that one of the needs of the Irish temperament was a\r\ntraining in science which would cultivate the habits of 'education,\r\nobservation, and reasoning,' and he pointed out that the peculiar\r\nmanufactures, trades, and occupations of the several localities would\r\ndetermine the course of studies. Mr. Wyse's memorandum on education led,\r\nas is well known, to the creation of the Board of National Education,\r\nbut, to quote Dr. Starkie,[24] the present Resident Commissioner of the\r\nBoard, 'the more important part of the scheme, dealing with a university\r\nand secondary education, was shelved, in spite of Mr. Wyse's warnings\r\nthat it was imprudent, dangerous, and pernicious to the social condition\r\nof the country, and to its future tranquillity, that so much\r\nencouragement should be given to the education of the lower classes,\r\nwithout at the same time due provision being made for the education of\r\nthe middle and upper classes.'\r\n\r\nAs still another evidence of the sound thought on educational problems\r\nwhich came from Irishmen who knew the actual conditions of their own\r\ncountry and people, the case of the agricultural instruction\r\nadministered by the National Board is pertinent. The late Sir Patrick\r\nKeenan has told us that landlords and others who on political and\r\nreligious grounds distrusted the National system, turned to this feature\r\nof the operations of the National Board with the greatest fervour. A\r\nscheme of itinerant instruction in agriculture, which had a curious\r\nresemblance to that which the Department of Agriculture is now\r\norganising, was developed, and was likely to have worked with the\r\ngreatest advantage to the country at large. Sir Patrick Keenan, who\r\nknew Ireland and the Irish people well, speaks of this part of the\r\nscheme as 'the most fruitful experiment in the material interests of the\r\ncountry that was ever attempted. It was,' he adds, 'through the agency\r\nof this corps of practical instructors that green cropping as a\r\nsystematic feature in farming was introduced into the South and West,\r\nand even into the central parts of Ireland.' But all the hopes thus\r\nraised went down, not before any intrinsic difficulties in the scheme\r\nitself, or before any adverse opinion to it in Ireland, but before the\r\nopposition of the Liverpool Financial Reform Association, who had their\r\nown views as to the limits of State interference with agriculture. These\r\nexamples, drawn from different stages of Irish educational history,\r\nmight easily be multiplied, but they will serve as typical instances of\r\nthat want of recognition by English statesmen of Irish thought on Irish\r\nproblems, and that ignoring of Irish sentiment--as distinguished from\r\nIrish sentimentality--which I insist is the basal element in the\r\nmisunderstandings of Irish problems.\r\n\r\nI now come to a brief consideration of some facts of the present\r\neducational situation, and I shall indicate, for those readers who are\r\nnot familiar with current events in Ireland, the significant evolution,\r\nor revolution, through which Irish education is passing. Within the last\r\neight years we have had in Ireland three very remarkable reports--in\r\nthemselves symptoms of a widespread unrest and dissatisfaction--on the\r\neducational systems of the country. I allude to the reports of two\r\nViceregal Commissions, one on Manual and Practical Instruction in our\r\nPrimary Schools, and the other on our Intermediate Education; and to the\r\nrecent report by a Royal Commission on University Education. These\r\nreports cover the three grades of our educational system, and each of\r\nthem contains a strong denunciation and a scathing criticism of the\r\nexisting provision and methods of instruction in elementary, secondary,\r\nand university education (outside Dublin University), respectively. One\r\nand all showed that the education to be had in our primary and secondary\r\nschools, as well as in the examining body known as the Royal University,\r\nhad little regard to the industrial or economic conditions of the\r\ncountry. We find, for example, agriculture taught out of a text book in\r\nthe primary schools, with the result that the _gamins_ of the Belfast\r\nstreets secured the highest marks in the subject. In the Intermediate\r\nsystem are to be found anomalies of a similar kind, which could not long\r\nhave survived if there had been a living opinion on educational matters\r\nin Ireland. No careful reader of the evidence given before the\r\nCommissions can fail to see that under our educational system the\r\nschools were practically bribed to fall in with a stereotyped course of\r\nstudies which left scant room for elasticity and adaptation to local\r\nneeds; that the teacher was, to all intents and purposes, deprived of\r\nhealthy initiative; and that the Irish parents must as a body have been\r\nin the dark as to the bearing of their children's studies on their\r\nprobable careers in life. A deep and wholesome impression was made in\r\nIreland by the exposure of the intrinsic evils of a system calculated in\r\nmy opinion to turn our youth into a generation of second-rate clerks,\r\nwith a distinct distaste for any industrial or productive occupation in\r\nwhich such qualities as initiative, self-reliance, or judgment were\r\ncalled for.\r\n\r\nI am told by competent authorities that there is not a single\r\neducational principle laid down in either the report on Manual\r\nInstruction or on Intermediate Education, which was not known and\r\napplied at least half a century ago in continental countries. In fact,\r\nin the Recess Committee investigations, as any reader of the report of\r\nthat body can see for himself, the Committee, guided by foreign\r\nexperience, foreshadowed practically every reform now being put into\r\noperation. It is better, of course, that we should reform late than\r\nnever, but it is well to bear in mind also, so far as the problems of\r\nthis book are concerned, how far the education of the country has fallen\r\nshort of any sound standard, and how little could have been expected\r\nfrom the working of our system. The curve of Irish illiteracy has indeed\r\nfallen continuously with each succeeding census, but true education as\r\nopposed to mere instruction has languished sadly.\r\n\r\nTogether with my friends and fellow-workers in the self-help movement, I\r\nbelieve that the problem of Irish education, like all other Irish\r\nproblems, must be reconsidered from the standpoint of its relation to\r\nthe practical affairs and everyday life of the people of Ireland. The\r\nneeds and opportunities of the industrial struggle must, in fact, mould\r\ninto shape our educational policy and programmes. We are convinced that\r\nthere is little hope of any real solution of the more general problem of\r\nnational education, unless and until those in direct contact with the\r\nspecific industries of the country succeed in bringing to the notice of\r\nthose engaged in the framing of our educational system the kind and\r\ndegree of the defects in the industrial character of our people which\r\ndebar them from successful competition with other countries. Education\r\nin Ireland has been too long a thing apart from the economic realities\r\nof the country--with what result we know. In the work of the Department\r\nof Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland, an attempt is\r\nbeing made to establish a vital relation between industrial education\r\nand industrial life. It is desired to try, at this critical stage of our\r\ndevelopment, the experiment--I call it an experiment only because it\r\ndoes not seem to have been tried before in Ireland--of directing our\r\ninstruction with a conscious and careful regard to the probable future\r\ncareers of those we are educating.\r\n\r\nThis attempt touches, of course, only one department of the whole\r\neducational problem, much of which it would be quite outside my present\r\npurpose to discuss. But I must guard against the supposition that in our\r\ninsistence upon the importance of the practical side of education we\r\nare under any doubt as to the great importance of the literary side. My\r\nfriends and I have been deeply impressed by the educational experience\r\nof Denmark, where the people, who are as much dependent on agriculture\r\nas are the Irish, have brought it by means of organisation to a more\r\ngenuine success than it has attained anywhere else in Europe. Yet an\r\ninquirer will at once discover that it is to the \"High Schools\" founded\r\nby Bishop Grundtvig, and not to the agricultural schools, which are also\r\nexcellent, that the extraordinary national progress is mainly due. A\r\nfriend of mine who was studying the Danish system of State aid to\r\nagriculture, found this to be the opinion of the Danes of all classes,\r\nand was astounded at the achievements of the associations of farmers,\r\nnot only in the manufacture of butter, but in a far more difficult\r\nundertaking, the manufacture of bacon in large factories equipped with\r\nall the most modern machinery and appliances which science had devised\r\nfor the production of the finished article. He at first concluded that\r\nthis success in a highly technical industry by bodies of farmers\r\nindicated a very perfect system of technical education. But he soon\r\nfound another cause. As one of the leading educators and agriculturists\r\nof the country put it to him: 'It's not technical instruction, it's the\r\nhumanities.' I would like to add that it is also, if I may coin a term,\r\nthe 'nationalities,' for nothing is more evident to the student of\r\nDanish education or, I might add, of the excellent system of the\r\nChristian Brothers in Ireland, than that one of the secrets of their\r\nsuccess is to be found in their national basis and their foundation\r\nupon the history and literature of the country.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the educational situation in Ireland, it is not too much to\r\nsay that all our forms of education, technical and general, hang loose.\r\nWe lack a body of trained teachers; we have no alert and informed public\r\nopinion on education and its function in regard to life; and there is no\r\nproper provision for research work in all branches, a deficiency, which,\r\nI am told by those who have given deep thought and long study to these\r\nproblems, inevitably reacts most disastrously on the general educational\r\nsystem of the country. This state of things appears not unnatural when\r\nwe remember that the Penal Laws were not repealed till almost the close\r\nof the eighteenth century, and that a large majority of the Irish people\r\nhad not full and free access to even primary and secondary education\r\nuntil the passing of the Emancipation Act in 1829. At the present day,\r\nthe absence of any provision for higher education of which Roman\r\nCatholics will avail themselves is not merely an enormous loss in\r\nitself, but it reacts most adversely upon the whole educational\r\nmachinery, and consequently upon the whole public life and thought of\r\nthat section of the nation.\r\n\r\nOne of the very first things I had to learn when I came into direct\r\ntouch with educational problems, was that the education of a country\r\ncannot be divided into water-tight compartments, and each part\r\nlegislated for or discussed solely on its merits and without reference\r\nto the other parts. I see now very clearly that the educational system\r\nof a country is an organic whole, the working of any part of which\r\nnecessarily has an influence on the working of the rest. I had always\r\nlooked upon the lower, secondary, and higher grades as the first,\r\nsecond, and third storeys of the educational house, and I am not quite\r\nsure that I attached sufficient importance to the staircase. My view has\r\nnow changed, and I find myself regarding the University as a foundation\r\nand support of the primary and secondary school.\r\n\r\nIt was not on purely pedagogic grounds that I added to my other\r\npolitical irregularities the earnest advocacy of such a provision for\r\nhigher education as Roman Catholics will avail themselves of. This great\r\nneed was revealed to me in my study of the Irish mind and of the\r\ndirection in which it could look for its higher development. My belief\r\nis based on practical experience; my point of view is that of the\r\neconomist. When the new economic mission in Ireland began now fourteen\r\nyears ago, we had to undertake, in addition to our practical programme,\r\na kind of University extension work with the important omission of the\r\nUniversity. We had to bring home to adult farmers whose general\r\neducation was singularly poor, though their native intelligence was keen\r\nand receptive, a large number of general ideas bearing on the productive\r\nand distributive side of their industry. Our chief obstacles arose from\r\nthe lack of trained economic thought among all classes, and especially\r\namong those to whom the majority looked for guidance. The air was thick\r\nwith economic fallacies or half-truths. We were, it is true, successful\r\nbeyond our expectations in planting in apparently uncongenial soil sound\r\neconomic principles. But our success was mainly due, as I shall show\r\nlater, to our having used the associative instincts of the Irish peasant\r\nto help out the working of our theories; and we became convinced that if\r\na tithe of our priests, public men, national school teachers, and\r\nmembers of our local bodies had received a university education, we\r\nshould have made much more rapid progress.\r\n\r\nI hardly know how to describe the mental atmosphere in which we were\r\nworking. It would be no libel upon the public opinion upon which we\r\nsought to make an impression to say that it really allowed no question\r\nto be discussed on its merits. Public opinion on social and economic\r\nquestions is changing now, but I cannot associate the change with any\r\ninfluence emanating from institutions of higher education. In other\r\ncountries, so far as my investigations have extended, the universities\r\ndo guide economic thought and have a distinct though wholly unofficial\r\nfunction as a court of appeal upon questions relating to the material\r\nprogress of the communities amongst which they are situated. Of such\r\ninstitutions there are in Ireland only two which could be expected to\r\ndirect in any large way the thought of the country upon economic and\r\nother important national questions--Maynooth, and Trinity College,\r\nDublin. Whether in their widely different spheres of influence these two\r\ninstitutions could, under conditions other than those prevailing, have\r\nso met the requirements of the country as to have obviated what is at\r\npresent an urgent necessity for a complete reorganisation of higher\r\neducation need not be discussed; but it is essential to my argument that\r\nI should set forth clearly the results of my own observation upon their\r\ninfluence, or rather lack of influence, upon the people among whom I\r\nhave worked.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Maynooth, actual and potential, can hardly be\r\nexaggerated, but it is exercised indirectly upon the secular thought of\r\nthe country. It is not its function to make a direct impression. It is\r\nin fact only a professional--I had almost said a technical--school. It\r\ntrains its students, most admirably I am told, in theology, philosophy,\r\nand the studies subsidiary to these sciences, but always, for the vast\r\nmajority of its students, with a distinctly practical and definite\r\nmissionary end in view. There is, I believe, an arts course of modest\r\nscope, designed rather to meet the deficiencies of students whose\r\ngeneral education has been neglected than to serve as anything in the\r\nnature of a university arts course. I am quite aware of the value of a\r\nsound training in mental science if given in connection with a full\r\nuniversity course, but I am equally convinced that the Maynooth\r\neducation, on the whole, is no substitute for a university course, and\r\nthat while its chief end of turning out a large number of trained\r\npriests has been fulfilled, it has not given, and could not be expected\r\nto have given, that broader and more humane culture which only a\r\nuniversity, as distinguished from a professional school, can adequately\r\nprovide.\r\n\r\nMoreover, under the Maynooth system young clerics are constantly called\r\nupon to take a part in the life of a lay community, towards which, when\r\nthey entered college, they were in no position of responsibility, and\r\nupon which, so far as secular matters are concerned, when they emerge\r\nfrom their theological training, they are no better adapted to exercise\r\na helpful influence. In my experience of priests I have met with many in\r\nwhom I recognised a sincere desire to attend to the material and social\r\nwell-being of their flocks, but who certainly had not that breadth of\r\nview and understanding of human nature which perhaps contact with the\r\nlaity during the years in which they were passing from discipline to\r\nauthority might have given to them. However this may be, it is clear and\r\nit is admitted that education as opposed to professional training of a\r\nhigh order is still, generally speaking, a want among the priests of\r\nIreland, and I look forward to no greater boon from a University or\r\nUniversity College for Roman Catholics than its influence, direct and\r\nindirect, on a body of men whose prestige and authority are necessarily\r\nso unique.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, to Trinity College, or the University of Dublin, that\r\none would naturally turn as to a great centre of thought in Ireland for\r\nhelp in the theoretic aspects, at least, of the practical problems upon\r\nwhose successful solution our national well-being depends. Judged by\r\nthe not unimportant test of the men it has supplied to the service of\r\nthe State and country during its three centuries of educational\r\nactivity, by the part it took in one of the brightest epochs of these\r\nthree centuries--the days when it gave Grattan to Grattan's Parliament,\r\nby the work and reputation of the _alumni_ it could muster to-day within\r\nand without its walls, our venerable seat of learning need not fear\r\ncomparison with any similar institutions in Great Britain. It may also,\r\nof course, be said that many men who have passed through Trinity College\r\nhave impressed the thought of Ireland, and, indeed, of the world, in one\r\nway or another--such men as, to take two very different examples, Burke\r\nand Thomas Davis--but on some of the very best spirits amongst these men\r\nTrinity College and its atmosphere have exerted influence rather by\r\nrepulsion than by attraction; and certainly their characteristics of\r\ntemper or thought have not been of a kind which those best acquainted\r\nwith the atmosphere of Trinity College associate with that institution.\r\nStill nothing can detract from the credit of having educated such men.\r\nBut these tests and standards are, for my present purpose, irrelevant. I\r\nam not writing a book on Irish educational history, or even a record of\r\npresent-day Irish educational achievement. I am rather trying, from the\r\nstandpoint of a practical worker for national progress, to measure the\r\nreality and strength of the educational and other influences which are\r\nactually and actively operating on the character and intellect of the\r\nmajority of the Irish people, moulding their thought and directing\r\ntheir action towards the upbuilding of our national life.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view I am bound to say that Trinity College, so far\r\nas I have seen, has had but little influence upon the minds or the lives\r\nof the people. Nor can I find that at any period of the extraordinarily\r\ninteresting economic and social revolution, which has been in progress\r\nin Ireland since the great catastrophe of the Famine period, Dublin\r\nUniversity has departed from its academic isolation and its aloofness\r\nfrom the great national problems that were being worked out. The more\r\none thinks of it, indeed, and the more one realises the opportunities of\r\nan institution like Trinity College in a country like Ireland, the more\r\none must recognise how small, in recent times, has been its positive\r\ninfluence on the mind of the country, and how little it has contributed\r\ntowards the solution of any of those problems, educational, economic, or\r\nsocial, that were clamant for solution, and which in any other country\r\nwould have naturally secured the attention of men who ought to have been\r\nleaders of thought.\r\n\r\nWhatever the causes, and many may be assigned, this unfortunate lack of\r\ninfluence on the part of Trinity College, has always seemed to me a\r\nstrong supplementary argument for the creation of another University or\r\nUniversity College on a more popular basis, to which the Roman Catholic\r\npeople of Ireland would have recourse. From the fact that Maynooth by\r\nits constitution could never have developed into a great national\r\nUniversity,[25] and that Trinity College has never, as a matter of fact,\r\ndone so, and has thus, in my opinion, missed a unique opportunity, it\r\nhas come about that Ireland has been without any great centre of thought\r\nwhose influence would have tended to leaven the mass of mental\r\ninactivity or random-thinking so prevalent in Ireland, and would have\r\ncreated a body of educated public opinion sufficiently informed and\r\npotent to secure the study and discussion on their merits of questions\r\nof vital interest to the country. The demoralising atmosphere of\r\npartisanship which hangs over Ireland would, I am convinced, gradually\r\ngive way before an organised system of education with a thoroughly\r\ndemocratic University at its head, which would diffuse amongst the\r\npeople at large a sense of the value of a balanced judgment on, and a\r\ntrue appreciation of, the real forces with which Ireland has to deal in\r\nbuilding up her fortunes.\r\n\r\nTo discuss the merits of the different solutions which have been\r\nproposed for the vexed problem of higher education in Ireland would be\r\nbeyond the scope of this book. The question will have to be faced, and\r\nall I need do here is to state the conditions which the solution will\r\nhave to fulfil if it is to deal with the aspects of the Irish Question\r\nwith which the new movement is practically concerned. What is most\r\nneeded is a University that will reach down to the rural population,\r\nmuch in the same way as the Scottish Universities do, and a lower scale\r\nof fees will be required than Trinity College, with its diminished\r\nrevenues, could establish. Already I can see that the work of the new\r\nDepartment, acting in conjunction with local bodies, urban and rural,\r\nthroughout the country, will provide a considerable number of\r\nscholarships, bursaries, and exhibitions for young men who are being\r\nprepared to take part in the very real, but rather hazily understood,\r\nindustrial revival which is imminent. Leaving sectarian controversies\r\nout of the question, the type of institution which is required in order\r\nto provide adequately for the classes now left outside the influence of\r\nhigher education is an institution pre-eminently national in its aims,\r\nand one intimately associated with the new movements making for the\r\ndevelopment of our national resources.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, in Ireland, and indeed in England too, there is\r\na tendency to regard educational institutions almost solely as they will\r\naffect religion. At least it is difficult to arouse any serious interest\r\nin them except from this point of view. I welcome, therefore, the\r\nstriking answers given to the queries of Lord Robertson, Chairman of the\r\nUniversity Commission, by Dr. O'Dwyer, the Roman Catholic Bishop of\r\nLimerick, who boldly and wisely placed the question before the country\r\nin the light in which cleric and layman should alike regard it:--\r\n\r\n     _The Chairman_.--(413): \"I suppose you believe a Catholic\r\n     University, such as you propose, will strengthen Roman Catholicism\r\n     in Ireland?\"--\"It is not easy to answer that; not so easy as it\r\n     looks.\" (414):--\"But it won't weaken it, or you would not be\r\n     here?\"--\"It would educate Catholics in Ireland very largely, and,\r\n     of course, a religious denomination composed of a body of educated\r\n     men is stronger than a religious denomination composed of ignorant\r\n     men. In that sense it would strengthen Roman Catholicism.\"\r\n     (415):--\"Is there any sense in which it won't?\"--\"As far as\r\n     religion is concerned, I do not know how a University would work\r\n     out. If you ask me now whether I think that that University in a\r\n     certain number of years would become a centre of thought,\r\n     strengthening the Catholic faith in Ireland, I cannot tell you. It\r\n     is a leap in the dark.\" (416):--\"But it is in the hope that it will\r\n     strengthen your own Church that you propose it?\"--\"No, it is not,\r\n     by any means. We are Bishops, but we are Irishmen, also, and we\r\n     want to serve our country.\"[26]\r\n\r\nEqually significant were the statements of Dr. O'Dea, the official\r\nspokesman of Maynooth, when he said,\r\n\r\n     I regard the interest of the laity in the settlement of the\r\n     University Question as supreme. The clergy are but a small, however\r\n     important, part of the nation, and the laity have never had an\r\n     institution of higher education comparable to Maynooth in magnitude\r\n     or resources. I recognise, therefore, that the educational\r\n     grievances of the laity are much more pressing than those of the\r\n     clergy ... It is generally admitted that Irish priests hold a\r\n     position of exceptional influence, due to historical causes, the\r\n     intensely religious character of the people, and the want of\r\n     Catholic laymen qualified by education and position for social and\r\n     political leadership. What Bishop Berkeley said of them in 1749, in\r\n     his letter, _A Word to the Wise_, still holds true, 'That no set of\r\n     men on earth have it in their power to do good on easier terms,\r\n     with more advantage to others, and less pains or loss to\r\n     themselves.' It would be folly to expect that in a mixed community\r\n     the State should do anything to strengthen or perpetuate this\r\n     power; but this result will certainly not follow from the more\r\n     liberal education of the clergy, provided equal advantages are\r\n     extended to the laity. On the contrary, I am convinced that if the\r\n     void in the lay leadership of the country be filled up by higher\r\n     education of the better classes among the Catholic laity, the power\r\n     of the priests, so far as it is abnormal or unnecessary will pass\r\n     away; and, further, if I believed, with many who are opposed to the\r\n     better education of the priesthood, that their power is based on\r\n     falsehood or superstition, I would unhesitatingly advocate the\r\n     spread of higher education among the laity and clergy alike, as the\r\n     best means of effectually sapping and disintegrating it.[27]\r\n\r\nI had for long indulged a hope that a university of the type which\r\nIreland requires would have been the outcome of a great national\r\neducational movement emanating from Trinity College, which might, at\r\nthis auspicious hour, have surpassed all the proud achievements of its\r\nthree hundred years. That hope was dispelled when the cry of 'Hands off\r\nTrinity' was applied to the profane hands of the Royal Commission.\r\nPerhaps that attitude may be reconsidered yet. There is one hopeful\r\nsentiment which is often heard coming from that institution. An opinion\r\nhas been strongly expressed that nothing ought to be done to separate in\r\nsecular life two sections of Irishmen who happen to belong to different\r\ncreeds. Whatever may be the logical outcome of the position taken up\r\ntowards the University problem by those who give expression to this\r\npious opinion, I do not for a moment doubt their sincerity. But I often\r\nthink that too much importance is attached to the danger of building new\r\nwalls, and that there is too little appreciation of the wide and deep\r\nfoundation of the already existing walls between the two sections of\r\nIrishmen who are so unhappily kept apart. In dealing with this, as with\r\nall large Irish problems, it had better be frankly recognised that there\r\nare in the country two races, two creeds, and, what is too little\r\nconsidered, two separate spheres of economic interest and pursuit.\r\nSocially two separate classes have naturally, nay inevitably, arisen out\r\nof these distinctions. One class has superior advantages in many ways of\r\ngreat importance. The other class is far more numerous, produces far the\r\ngreater proportion of the nation's wealth, and is, therefore, from the\r\nnational point of view, of greater importance. But both are necessary.\r\nBoth must be adequately provided for in the supreme matter of higher\r\neducation. Above all, the two classes must be educated to regard\r\nthemselves as united by the bond of a common country--a sentiment which,\r\nif genuine, would treat differences arising from whatever cause, not as\r\na difficulty in the way of national progress, but rather as affording a\r\nvariety of opportunities for national expansion.\r\n\r\nI do not concern myself as to the exact form which the new institution\r\nor institutions which are to give us the absolutely essential advantage\r\nof higher education should take. If in view of the difference in the\r\nrequirements to which I have alluded, and the complicated pedagogic and\r\nadministrative considerations which have to be taken into account,\r\nschemes of co-education of Protestants and Roman Catholics are difficult\r\nof immediate accomplishment, let that ideal be postponed. The two creeds\r\ncan meet in the playground now: they can meet everywhere in after life.\r\nIreland will bring them together soon enough if Ireland is given a\r\nchance, and when the time is ripe for their coming together in higher\r\neducation they will come together. If the time is not now ripe for this\r\nideal there is no justification for postponing educational reform until\r\nthe relations between the two creeds have been elevated to a plane\r\nwhich, in my opinion, they will never reach except through the aid of\r\nthat culture which a widely diffused higher education alone can afford.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I was beginning to write this chapter I chanced to pick up the\r\n_Chesterfield Letters_. I opened the book at the two hundredth epistle,\r\nand, curiously enough, almost the first sentence which caught my eye\r\nran: 'Education more than nature is the cause of that difference you see\r\nin the character of men.' I felt myself at first in strong disagreement\r\nwith this aphorism. But when I came to reflect how much the nature of\r\none generation must be the outcome of the education of those which went\r\nbefore it, I gradually came to see the truth in Lord Chesterfield's\r\nwords. I must leave it to experts to define the exact steps which ought\r\nto be taken to make the general education of this country capable of\r\ncultivating the judgment, strengthening the will, and so of building up\r\nthe character. But every day, every thought, I give to the problems of\r\nIrish progress convinces me more firmly that this is the real task of\r\neducational reform, a task that must be accomplished before we can prove\r\nto those who brand us with racial inferiority that, in Ireland, it was\r\nnot nature that has been unkind in causing the difference we find in the\r\ncharacter of men.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[23] _Leaders of Public Opinion in Ireland_, II., 122-4.\r\n\r\n[24] _Recent Reforms in Irish Education_, p. 7.\r\n\r\n[25] It was not authorised to give degrees to lay students; and even the\r\nadmission of lay students to an Arts course was prohibited by\r\nGovernment, lest Catholic students should be drawn away from Trinity\r\nCollege.

The task has been one of great\r\ndifficulty, as it was necessary to tell, not only the truth--for that\r\neven an official person may be excused--but also the whole truth, which,\r\nunless made compulsory by the kissing of the book, is regarded as a\r\ngratuitous kissing of the rod. From the frying pan of political dispute,\r\nI have passed into the fire of sectarian controversy. I have not\r\nhesitated to poach on the preserves of historians and economists, and\r\nhave even bearded the pedagogues in their dens. Before my stock of\r\nmetaphors is exhausted, let me say that I have one hope of escape from\r\nthe cross-fire of denunciation which independent speaking about Ireland\r\nis apt to provoke. I once witnessed a football match between two\r\nvillages, one of which favoured a political party called by the name of\r\na leader, with an 'ism' added to indicate a policy, the other adopting\r\nthe same name, still further elongated by the prefix 'anti.' When I\r\narrived on the scene the game had begun in deadly earnest, but I noticed\r\nthe ball lying unmolested in another quarter of the field. In Irish\r\npublic life I have often had reason to envy that ball, and perhaps now\r\nits lot may be mine, while the game goes on and the critics pay\r\nattention to each other.\r\n\r\nTo my friendly critics a word of explanation is due. The opinions to\r\nwhich I have given expression are based upon personal observation and\r\nexperience extending over a quarter of a century during which I have\r\nbeen in close touch with Irish life at home, and not unfamiliar with it\r\nabroad. I have referred to history only when I could not otherwise\r\naccount for social and economic conditions with which I came into\r\ncontact, or with which I desired practically to deal. Whether looking\r\nback over the dreary wastes of Anglo-Irish history, or studying the men\r\nand things of to-day, I came to conclusions which differed widely from\r\nwhat I had been taught to believe by those whose theories of Irish\r\ndevelopment had not been subjected to any practical test. Deeply as I\r\nhave felt for the past sufferings of the Irish people and their heritage\r\nof disability and distress, I could not bring myself to believe that,\r\nwhere misgovernment had continued so long, and in such an immense\r\nvariety of circumstances and conditions, the governors could have been\r\nalone to blame. I envied those leaders of popular thought whose\r\nconfidence in themselves and in their followers was shaken by no such\r\nreflections. But the more I listened to them the more the conviction was\r\nborne in upon me that they were seeking to build an impossible future\r\nupon an imaginary past.\r\n\r\nThose who know Ireland from within are aware that Irish thought upon\r\nIrish problems has been undergoing a silent, and therefore too lightly\r\nregarded revolution. The surface of Irish life, often so inexplicably\r\nruffled, and sometimes so inexplicably calm, has just now become smooth\r\nto a degree which has led to hasty conclusions as to the real cause and\r\nthe inward significance of the change. To chime in with the thoughtless\r\noptimism of the hour will do no good; but a real understanding of the\r\nforces which have created the existing situation will reveal an\r\nunprecedented opportunity for those who would give to the Irish mind\r\nthat full and free development which has been so long and, as I have\r\ntried to show, so unnaturally delayed.\r\n\r\nAmong these new forces in Irish life there is one which has been greatly\r\nmisunderstood; and yet to its influence during the last few years much\r\nof the 'transformation scene' in the drama of the Irish Question is\r\nreally due. It deserves more than a passing notice here, because, while\r\nits aims as formulated appear somewhat restricted, it unquestionably\r\ntends in practice towards that national object of paramount importance,\r\nthe strengthening of character. I refer to the movement known as the\r\nGaelic Revival. Of this movement I am myself but an outside observer,\r\nhaving been forced to devote nearly all my time and energies to a\r\nvariety of attempts which aim at the doing in the industrial sphere of\r\nvery much the same work as that which the Gaelic movement attempts in\r\nthe intellectual sphere--the rehabilitation of Ireland from within. But\r\nin the course of my work of agricultural and industrial development I\r\nnaturally came across this new intellectual force and found that when it\r\nbegan to take effect, so far from diverting the minds of the peasantry\r\nfrom the practical affairs of life, it made them distinctly more\r\namenable to the teaching of the dry economic doctrine of which I was an\r\napostle. The reason for this is plain enough to me now, though, like all\r\nmy theories about Ireland, the truth came to me from observation and\r\npractical experience rather than as the result of philosophic\r\nspeculation. For the co-operative movement depended for its success upon\r\na two-fold achievement. In order to get it started at all, its\r\nprinciples and working details had to be grasped by the Irish peasant\r\nmind and commended to his intelligence. Its further development and its\r\nhopes of permanence depend upon the strengthening of character, which, I\r\nmust repeat, is the foundation of all Irish progress.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Agricultural Organisation Society[28] exerts its influence--a\r\nnow established and rapidly-growing influence--mainly through the medium\r\nof associations. The Gaelic movement, on the other hand, acts more\r\ndirectly upon the individual, and the two forces are therefore in a\r\nsense complementary to each other. Both will be seen to be playing an\r\nimportant part--I should say a necessary part--in the reconstruction of\r\nour national life. At any rate, I feel that it is necessary to my\r\nargument that I should explain to those who are as ill-informed about\r\nthe Gaelic revival as I was myself until its practical usefulness was\r\ndemonstrated to me, what exactly seems to be the most important outcome\r\nof the work of that movement.\r\n\r\nThe Gaelic League, which defines its objects as 'The preservation of\r\nIrish as the national language of Ireland and the extension of its use\r\nas a spoken tongue; the study and publication of existing Irish\r\nliterature and the cultivation of a modern literature in Irish,' was\r\nformed in 1893. Like the Agricultural Organisation Society, the Gaelic\r\nLeague is declared by its constitution to be 'strictly non-political and\r\nnon-sectarian,' and, like it, has been the object of much suspicion,\r\nbecause severance from politics in Ireland has always seemed to the\r\npolitician the most active form of enmity. Its constitution, too, is\r\nsomewhat similar, being democratically guided in its policy by the\r\nelected representatives of its affiliated branches. It is interesting to\r\nnote that the funds with which it carries on an extensive propaganda are\r\nmainly supplied from the small contributions of the poor. It publishes\r\ntwo periodicals, one weekly and another monthly. It administers an\r\nincome of some £6,000 a year, not reckoning what is spent by local\r\nbranches, and has a paid staff of eleven officers, a secretary,\r\ntreasurer, and nine organisers, together with a large number of\r\nvoluntary workers. It resembled the agricultural movement also in the\r\nfact that it made very little headway during the first few years of its\r\nexistence. But it had a nucleus of workers with new ideas for the\r\nintellectual regeneration of Ireland. In face of much apathy they\r\npersisted with their propaganda, and they have at last succeeded in\r\nmaking their ideas understood. So much is evident from the\r\nrapidly-increasing number of affiliated branches of the League, which in\r\nMarch, 1903, amounted to 600, almost treble the number registered two\r\nyears before. But even this does not convey any idea of the influence\r\nwhich the movement exerts. Within the past year the teaching of the\r\nIrish language has been introduced into no less than 1,300 National\r\nSchools. In 1900 the number of schools in which Irish was taught was\r\nonly about 140. The statement that our people do not read books is\r\ngenerally accepted as true, yet the sale of the League publications\r\nduring one year reached nearly a quarter of a million copies. These\r\nresults cannot be left unconsidered by anybody who wishes to understand\r\nthe psychology of the Irish mind. The movement can truly claim to have\r\neffected the conversion of a large amount of intellectual apathy into\r\ngenuine intellectual activity.\r\n\r\nThe declared objects of the League--- the popularising of the national\r\nlanguage and literature--do not convey, perhaps, an adequate conception\r\nof its actual work, or of the causes of its popularity. It seeks to\r\ndevelop the intellectual, moral, and social life of the Irish people\r\nfrom within, and it is doing excellent work in the cause of temperance.\r\nIts president, Dr. Douglas Hyde, in his evidence given before the\r\nUniversity Commission,[29] pointed out that the success of the League\r\nwas due to its meeting the people half way; that it educated them by\r\ngiving them something which they could appreciate and assimilate; and\r\nthat it afforded a proof that people who would not respond to alien\r\neducational systems, will respond with eagerness to something they can\r\ncall their own. The national factor in Ireland has been studiously\r\neliminated from national education, and Ireland is perhaps the only\r\ncountry in Europe where it was part of the settled policy of those, who\r\nhad the guidance of education to ignore the literature, history, arts,\r\nand traditions of the people. It was a fatal policy, for it obviously\r\ntended to stamp their native country in the eyes of Irishmen with the\r\nbadge of inferiority and to extinguish the sense of healthy self-respect\r\nwhich comes from the consciousness of high national ancestry and\r\ntraditions. This policy, rigidly adhered to for many years, almost\r\nextinguished native culture among Irishmen, but it did not succeed in\r\nmaking another form of culture acceptable to them. It dulled the\r\nintelligence of the people, impaired their interest in their own\r\nsurroundings, stimulated emigration by teaching them to look on other\r\ncountries as more agreeable places to live in, and made Ireland almost a\r\nsocial desert. Men and women without culture or knowledge of literature\r\nor of music have succeeded a former generation who were passionately\r\ninterested in these things, an interest which extended down even to the\r\nwayside cabin. The loss of these elevating influences in Irish society\r\nprobably accounts for much of the arid nature of Irish controversies,\r\nwhile the reaction against their suppression has given rise to those\r\ndisplays of rhetorical patriotism for which the Irish language has found\r\nthe expressive term _raimeis_, and which (thanks largely to the Gaelic\r\nmovement) most people now listen to with a painful and half-ashamed\r\nsense of their unreality.\r\n\r\nThe Gaelic movement has brought to the surface sentiments and thoughts\r\nwhich had been developed in Gaelic Ireland through hundreds of years,\r\nand which no repression had been able to obliterate altogether, but\r\nwhich still remained as a latent spiritual inheritance in the mind. And\r\nnow this stream, which has long run underground, has again emerged even\r\nstronger than before, because an element of national self-consciousness\r\nhas been added at its re-emergence. A passionate conviction is gaining\r\nground that if Irish traditions, literature, language, art, music, and\r\nculture are allowed to disappear, it will mean the disappearance of the\r\nrace; and that the education of the country must be nationalised if our\r\nsocial, intellectual, or even our economic position is to be permanently\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nWith this view of the Gaelic movement my own thoughts are in complete\r\naccord. It is undeniable that the pride in country justly felt by\r\nEnglishmen, a pride developed by education and a knowledge of their\r\nhistory, has had much to do with the industrial pre-eminence of England;\r\nfor the pioneers of its commerce have been often actuated as much by\r\npatriotic motives as by the desire for gain. The education of the Irish\r\npeople has ignored the need for any such historical basis for pride or\r\nlove of country, and, for my part, I feel sure that the Gaelic League is\r\nacting wisely in seeking to arouse such a sentiment, and to found it\r\nmainly upon the ages of Ireland's story when Ireland was most Irish.\r\n\r\nIt is this expansion of the sentiment of nationality outside the domain\r\nof party politics--the distinction, so to speak, between nationality and\r\nnationalism--which is the chief characteristic of the Gaelic movement.\r\nNationality had come to have no meaning other than a political one, any\r\nbroader national sentiment having had little or nothing to feed upon.\r\nDuring the last century the spirit of nationality has found no unworthy\r\nexpression in literature, in the writings of Ferguson, Standish O'Grady\r\nand Yeats, which, however, have not been even remotely comparable in\r\npopularity with the political journalism in prose and rhyme in which the\r\nage has been so fruitful. It has never expressed itself in the arts, and\r\nnot only has Ireland no representative names in the higher regions of\r\nart, but the national deficiency has been felt in every department of\r\nindustry into which design enters, and where national\r\nart-characteristics have a commercial value. The national customs,\r\nculture, and recreations which made the country a pleasant place to live\r\nin, have almost disappeared, and with them one of the strongest ties\r\nwhich bind people to the country of their birth. The Gaelic revival, as\r\nI understand it, is an attempt to supply these deficiencies, to give to\r\nIrish people a culture of their own; and I believe that by awakening the\r\nfeelings of pride, self-respect, and love of country, based on\r\nknowledge, every department of Irish life will be invigorated.\r\n\r\nThus it is that the elevating influence upon the individual is exerted.\r\nPolitics have never awakened initiative among the mass of the people,\r\nbecause there was no programme of action for the individual. Perhaps it\r\nis as well for Ireland that such should have been the case, for, as it\r\nhas been shown, we have had little of the political thought which should\r\nbe at the back of political action. Political action under present\r\nconditions must necessarily be deputed to a few representatives, and\r\nafter the vote is given or the cheering at a meeting has ceased, the\r\nindividual can do nothing but wait, and his lethargy tends to become\r\nstill deeper. In the Gaelic revival there is a programme of work for the\r\nindividual; his mind is engaged, thought begets energy, and this energy\r\nvitalises every part of his nature. This makes for the strengthening of\r\ncharacter, and so far from any harm being done to the practical\r\nmovement, to which I have so often referred, the testimony of my\r\nfellow-workers, as well as my own observation, is unanimous in affirming\r\nthat the influence of the branches of the Gaelic League is distinctly\r\nuseful whenever it is sought to move the people to industrial or\r\ncommercial activity.\r\n\r\nMany of my political friends cannot believe--and I am afraid that\r\nnothing that I can say will make them believe--that the movement is not\r\nnecessarily, in the political sense, separatist in its sentiment. This\r\nimpression is, in my opinion, founded on a complete misunderstanding of\r\nAnglo-Irish history. Those who look askance at the rise of the Gaelic\r\nmovement ignore the important fact that there has never been any\r\nessential opposition between the English connection and Irish\r\nnationality. The Elizabethan chiefs of the sixteenth and the Gaelic\r\npoets of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when the relations\r\nbetween the two countries were far worse than they are to-day, knew\r\nnothing of this opposition. The true sentiment of nationality is a\r\npriceless heritage of every small nation which has done great things,\r\nand had it not largely perished in Ireland, separatist sentiment, the\r\noffspring, not of Irish nationality, but of Irish political nationalism,\r\ncould hardly have survived until to-day.\r\n\r\nBut undoubtedly we strike here on a danger to the Gaelic movement, so\r\nfar at least as that movement is bound up with the future of the Gaelic\r\nLeague; a danger which cannot be left out of account in any estimate of\r\nthis new force in Irish life. The continuance of the League as a\r\nbeneficent force, or indeed a force at all, seems to me, as in the case\r\nof the co-operative organisation to which I have compared it, to be\r\nvitally dependent on a scrupulous observance of that part of its\r\nconstitution which keeps the door open to Irishmen of every creed or\r\npolitical party. Only thus can the League remain a truly national body,\r\nand attract from all classes Irishmen who are capable of forwarding its\r\ntrue policy. I do not think there is much danger of a spirit of\r\nsectarian exclusiveness developing itself in a body mainly composed of\r\nRoman Catholics whose President is a Protestant. But it cannot be denied\r\nthat there has been an occasional tendency to interpret the 'no\r\npolitics' clause of the constitution in a manner which seems hardly fair\r\nto Unionists or even to constitutional Home Rulers who may have joined\r\nthe organisation on the strength of its declaration of political\r\nneutrality. If this is not a mere transitory phenomenon its effect will\r\nbe serious. As a political body the League would immediately sink into\r\ninsignificance and probably disappear amid a crowd of contending\r\nfactions. It would certainly cease to fulfil its great function of\r\ncreating a nationality of the thought and spirit, in which all Irishmen\r\nwho wish to be anything else than English colonists might aspire to\r\nshare. Its early successes in bringing together men of different\r\npolitical views were remarkable. At the very outset of its career it\r\nenlisted the support of so militant a politician as the late Rev. R.R.\r\nKane, who declared that though a Unionist and an Orangeman he had no\r\ndesire to forget that he was an O'Cahan. On this basis it is difficult\r\nto set a limit to the fruitfulness of the work which this organisation\r\nmight do for Ireland, and I cannot regard any who would depart from the\r\nletter and spirit of its constitution as sincere, or if sincere as wise,\r\nfriends of the movement with which they are associated.\r\n\r\nOf minor importance are certain extravagances in the conduct of the\r\nmovement which time and practical experience can hardly fail to correct.\r\nI have borne witness to the value of the cultivation of the language\r\neven from my own practical standpoint, but I cannot think that to sign\r\ncheques in Irish, and get angry when those who cannot understand will\r\nnot honour them, is a good way of demonstrating that value. I should,\r\nspeaking generally, regard it as a mistake, supposing it were\r\npracticable, to substitute Irish for English in the conduct of business.\r\nIf any large development of the trade in pampooties, turf and potheen\r\nbetween the Aran Islands and the mainland were in contemplation, this\r\nattempt might be justified. But on behalf of those Philistines who\r\nattach paramount importance to the development of Irish industry, trade\r\nand commerce on a large and comprehensive scale, I should regret a\r\ncourse which, from a business point of view, would be about as wise as\r\nthe advocacy of distinctive Irish currency, weights and measures. And I\r\nprotest more strongly against the reasons which have been given to me\r\nfor this policy. I have been told that, in order to generate sufficient\r\nenthusiasm, a young movement of the kind must adopt a rigorous\r\ndiscipline and an aggressive policy. Not only are we thus confronted\r\nwith a false issue, but by giving countenance to the outward acceptance\r\nof what the better sense rejects, these over-zealous leaguers are\r\nadministering to the Irish character the very poison which all Irish\r\nmovements should combine to eliminate from the national life.\r\n\r\nThe position which I have given to the Gaelic Revival among the new\r\ninfluences at work and making for progress in Ireland will hardly be\r\nunderstood by those who have never embraced the idea of combining all\r\nsuch forces in a constructive and comprehensive scheme of national\r\nadvancement. One instance of the potential utility of the Gaelic League\r\nwill appeal to those of my readers who attach as much importance as I do\r\nto the improvement of the peasant home. Concerted action to this end is\r\nbeing planned while I write. It is proposed to take a few districts\r\nwhere the peasants are members of one of the new co-operative societies,\r\nand where the clergy have taken a keen interest in the economic and\r\nsocial advancement of the members of the Society, but where the cottages\r\nare in the normal condition. The new Department will lend the services\r\nof its domestic economy teachers. The Organisation Society, the clergy,\r\nand the Department thus working together will, I hope, be able to get\r\nthe people of the selected districts to effect an improvement in their\r\ndomestic surroundings which will act as an invaluable example for other\r\ndistricts to follow. But in order that this much needed contribution to\r\nthe well-being of the peasant proprietary, upon which all our thoughts\r\nare just now concentrated, may be assisted with the enthusiasm which\r\nbelongs in Ireland to a consciously national effort, it is hoped that\r\ncommon action with the Gaelic League may be possible, so that this force\r\nalso may be enlisted in the solution of this part of our central\r\nproblem, the rehabilitation of rural life in Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, on more general grounds that I have, albeit as an\r\noutside observer, watched with some anxiety and much gratification the\r\nprogress of the Gaelic Revival. In the historical evolution of the Irish\r\nmind we find certain qualities atrophied, so to speak, by disuse; and to\r\nthis cause I attribute the past failures of the race in practical life\r\nat home. I have shown how politics, religion, and our systems of\r\neducation have all, in their respective influences upon the people,\r\nmissed to a large extent, the effect upon character which they should\r\nhave made it their paramount duty to produce. Nevertheless, whenever the\r\nintellect of the people is appealed to by those who know its past, a\r\nrecuperative power is manifested which shows that its vitality has not\r\nbeen irredeemably impaired. It is because I believe that, on the whole,\r\na right appeal has been made by the Gaelic League that I have borne\r\ntestimony to its patriotic endeavours.\r\n\r\nThe question of the Gaelic Revival seems to be really a form of the\r\neternal question of the interdependence of the practical and the ideal\r\nin Ireland. Their true relation to each other is one of the hardest\r\nlessons the student of our problems has to learn. I recall an incident\r\nin the course of my own studies which I will here recount, as it appears\r\nto me to furnish an admirable illustration of this difficulty as it\r\npresented itself to a very interesting mind. During the years covering\r\nthe rise and fall of Parnell, when interest in the Irish Question was at\r\nits zenith, the newspapers of the United States kept in London a corps\r\nof very able correspondents, who watched and reported to their\r\ntransatlantic readers every move in the Home Rule campaign. An American\r\npublic, by no means limited to the American-Irish, devoured every morsel\r\nof this intelligence with an avidity which could not have been surpassed\r\nif the United States had been engaged in a war with Great Britain. Among\r\nthese correspondents perhaps the most brilliant was the late Harold\r\nFrederic. Not many months before he died I received a letter from him,\r\nin which he said that, although we were unknown to each other, he\r\nthought, from some public utterances of mine, that we must have many\r\nviews in common. He had often intended to get an introduction to me, and\r\nnow suggested that we should 'waive things and meet.' We met and spent\r\nan evening together, which left some deep impressions on my mind. He\r\ntold me that the Irish Question possessed for him a fascination for\r\nwhich he could give no rational explanation. He had absolutely no tie of\r\nblood or material interest with Ireland, and his friendship for it had\r\nbrought him the only quarrels in which he had ever been engaged.\r\n\r\nWhat chiefly interested me in Harold Frederic's philosophy of the Irish\r\nQuestion was that he had arrived at a diagnosis of the Irish mind not\r\nsubstantially different from my own. Since that evening I have come\r\nacross a passage in one of his novels, which clothes in delightful\r\nlanguage his view of the chaotic psychology of the Celt:\r\n\r\n     There, in Ireland, you get a strange mixture of elementary early\r\n     peoples, walled off from the outer world by the four seas, and\r\n     free to work out their own racial amalgam on their own lines. They\r\n     brought with them at the outset a great inheritance of Eastern\r\n     mysticism. Others lost it, but the Irish, all alone on their\r\n     island, kept it alive and brooded on it, and rooted their whole\r\n     spiritual side in it. Their religion is full of it; their blood is\r\n     full of it.... The Ireland of two thousand years ago is incarnated\r\n     in her. They are the merriest people and the saddest, the most\r\n     turbulent and the most docile, the most talented and the most\r\n     unproductive, the most practical and the most visionary, the most\r\n     devout and the most pagan. These impossible contradictions war\r\n     ceaselessly in their blood.[30]\r\n\r\nIn our conversation what struck me most was the influence which politics\r\nhad exercised even on his philosophic mind, notwithstanding a low\r\nestimate of our political leaders. In one of a series of three notable\r\narticles upon the Irish Question, which appeared anonymously in the\r\n_Fortnightly Review_[31] in the winter of 1893-4, and of which he told\r\nme he was the writer, he had given a character sketch of what he called\r\n'The Rhetoricians.' Their performances since the Union were summarised\r\nin the phrase 'a century of unremitting gabble,' and he regarded it as a\r\nsad commentary on Irish life that such brilliant talents so largely ran\r\nto waste in destructive criticism.\r\n\r\nI naturally turned the conversation on to my own line of thought, and\r\ndiscussed the practical conclusions to which his studies had led him. I\r\ntried to elicit from him exactly what he had in his mind when, in one of\r\nthe articles to which I have referred, he advocated 'a reconstruction of\r\nIreland on distinctive national lines.' I hoped to find that his\r\npsychological study of my countrymen would enable him to throw some\r\nlight upon the means by which play could be given at home to the latent\r\ncapacities of the race. I found that he was in entire accord with my\r\nview, that the chief difficulty in the way of constructive statesmanship\r\nwas the defect in the Irish character about which I have said so much. I\r\nwas prepared for that conclusion, for I had already seen the lack of\r\ninitiative admirably appreciated in the following illuminating sentence\r\nof his:--'The Celt will help someone else to do the thing that other has\r\nin mind, and will help him with great zeal and devotion; but he will not\r\nstart to do the thing he himself has thought of.'[32] But I was\r\ndisappointed when he bade me his first and last good-bye that I had not\r\nconvinced him that there was any way out of the Irish difficulty other\r\nthan political changes, for which, at the same time, he appeared to\r\nthink the people singularly unfitted.\r\n\r\nThe fact is we had arrived at the point where the student of Irish life\r\nusually finds himself in a _cul de sac_. If he has accurately observed\r\nthe conditions, he is face to face with a problem which appears to be in\r\nits nature insoluble. For at every turn he finds things being done wrong\r\nwhich might so easily be done right, only that nobody is concerned that\r\nthey should be done right. And what is worse, when he has learned, in\r\nthe course of his investigations, to discount the picturesque\r\nexplanation of our unsuccess in practical life which in Ireland veils\r\nthe unpleasant truth, he will find that the people are quite aware of\r\ntheir defects, although they attribute them to causes beyond their power\r\nto remove. Then, too, the sympathetic inquirer is shocked by the lack of\r\nseriousness in it all. With all their past griefs and their high\r\naspirations, the Irish people seem to be play-acting before the world.\r\nThe inquirer does not, perhaps, reflect that, if play-acting be\r\ninconsistent with the deepest emotions, and with the pursuit of high\r\nideals, then he condemns a little over one half of the human race.[33]\r\nHe probably comes to the main conclusion adopted in these pages, and\r\nrealises that the Irish Question is a problem of character. And as Irish\r\ncharacter is the product of Irish history, which cannot be re-enacted,\r\nhe leaves the problem there. Harold Frederic left it there, and there it\r\nhas been taken up by those whose endeavour forms the story which I have\r\nto tell.\r\n\r\nI now come to the principles which, it appears to me, must underlie the\r\nsolution of this problem. The narrative contained in the second part of\r\nthis book is a record of the efforts made during the last decade of the\r\nnineteenth and the first two years of the twentieth century by a small,\r\nbut now rapidly augmenting group of Irishmen, to pluck the brand of\r\nIrish intellect from the burning of the Irish Question. The problem\r\nbefore us was, my readers will now understand, how to make headway in\r\nview of the weakness of character to which I have had to attribute the\r\nparalysis of our activities in the past. We were quite aware that our\r\nprogress would at first be slow. But as we were satisfied that the\r\ndefects of character which stood in the way of economic advancement were\r\ndue to causes which need no longer be operative, and that the intellect\r\nof the people was unimpaired, we faced the problem with confidence.\r\n\r\nThe practical form which our work took was the launching upon Irish life\r\nof a movement of organised self-help, and the subsequent grafting upon\r\nthis movement of a system of State-aid to the agriculture and industries\r\nof the country. I need not here further elaborate this programme, for\r\nthe steps by which it has been and is being adopted will be presently\r\ndescribed in detail. But there is one aspect of the new movement in\r\nIreland which must be understood by those who would grasp the true\r\nsignificance and the human interest of an evolution in our national\r\nlife, the only recent parallel for which, as far as I am aware, is to be\r\nfound in Japan: though to my mind the conscious attempt of the Irish\r\npeople to develop a civilisation of their own is far more interesting\r\nthan the recent efforts of the Japanese to westernise their\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe problem of mind and character with which we had to deal in Ireland\r\npresented this central and somewhat discouraging fact. In practical life\r\nthe Irish had failed where the English had succeeded, and this was\r\nattributed to the lack of certain English qualities which have been\r\nundoubtedly essential to success in commerce and in industry from the\r\ndays of the industrial revolution until a comparatively recent date. It\r\nwas the individualism of the English economic system during this period\r\nwhich made these qualities indispensable. The lack of these qualities in\r\nIrishmen to-day may be admitted, and the cause of the deficiency has\r\nbeen adequately explained. But those who regard the Irish situation as\r\nindustrially hopeless probably ignore the fact that there are other\r\nqualities, of great and growing importance under modern economic\r\nconditions, which can be developed in Irishmen and may form the basis of\r\nan industrial system. I refer to the range of qualities which come into\r\nplay rather in association than in the individual, and to which the term\r\n'associative' is applied.[34] So that although much disparaging\r\ncriticism of Irish character is based upon the survival in the Celt of\r\nthe tribal instincts, it is gratifying to be able to show that even from\r\nthe practical English point of view, our preference for thinking and\r\nworking in groups may not be altogether a _damnosa hereditas_. If, owing\r\nto our deficiency in the individualistic qualities of the English, we\r\ncannot at this stage hope to produce many types of the 'economic man' of\r\nthe economists, we think we see our way to provide, as a substitute, the\r\neconomic association. If the association succeeds, and by virtue of its\r\nfinancial success becomes permanent, a great change will, in our\r\nopinion, be produced on the character of its members. The reflex action\r\nupon the individual mind of the habit of doing, in association with\r\nothers, things which were formerly left undone, or badly done, may be\r\nrelied upon to have a tonic effect upon the character of the individual.\r\nThis is, I suppose, the secret of discipline, which, though apparently\r\neliminating volition, seems in weak characters to strengthen the will.\r\n\r\nThere is, too, as we have learned, in the association a strange\r\ninfluence which develops qualities and capacities that one would not\r\nexpect on a mere consideration of the character of its members. This\r\npsychological phenomenon has been admirably and most entertainingly\r\ndiscussed by the French psychologist, Le Bon,[35] who, in the attractive\r\npursuit of paradox, almost goes to the length of the proposition that\r\nthe association inherently possesses qualities the opposite of those\r\npossessed by its members. My own experience--and I have had\r\nopportunities of observing hundreds of associations formed by my friends\r\nupon the principles above laid down--does not carry me quite so far.\r\nBut, unquestionably, the association in Ireland does often become an\r\nentity as distinct from the individualities of which it is composed, as\r\nis a new chemical compound from its constituent elements.\r\n\r\nAssociations of the kind we had in our minds, which were to be primarily\r\nfor purely business purposes, were bound to have many collateral\r\neffects. They would open up outside of politics and religion, but not in\r\nconflict with either, a sphere of action where an independence new to\r\nthe country would have to be exercised. In Ireland public opinion is\r\nunder an obsession which, whether political, religious, historical, or\r\nall three combined, is probably unique among civilised peoples. Until\r\nthe last few years, for example, it was our habit--one which immensely\r\nweakened the influence of Ireland in the Imperial Parliament--to form\r\nextravagant estimates of men, exalting and abasing them with irrational\r\ncaprice, not according to their qualities so much as by their attitude\r\ntowards the passion of the hour. The ups and downs of the reputations of\r\nLord Spencer and Mr. Arthur Balfour in Ireland are a sufficient\r\nillustration of our disregard of the old Latin proverb which tells us\r\nthat no man ever became suddenly altogether bad. Even now public opinion\r\nis too prone to attach excessive value to projects of vague and\r\nvisionary development, and to underrate the importance of serious\r\nthought and quiet work, which can be the only solid foundation of our\r\nnational progress. In these new associations--humble indeed in their\r\norigin, but destined to play a large part in the people's\r\nlives--projects, professing to be fraught with economic benefit, have to\r\nbe judged by the cruel precision of audited balance sheets, and the\r\nworth of men is measured by the solid contribution they have made to the\r\nwelfare of the community.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have now accomplished one long stage of my journey towards the\r\nconclusion of this discussion of the needs of modern Ireland. Were I to\r\nstop here, probably most of those who had been induced to open yet\r\nanother book upon the Irish Question would accuse me, and not without\r\njustice, of being responsible for a barren graft upon a barren\r\ncontroversy. I fear no such criticism, whatever other shortcomings may\r\nbe detected, from those who have the patience to read on. For when I\r\npass from my own reflections to record the work to which many thousands\r\nof my countrymen have addressed themselves in building up the Ireland of\r\nthe twentieth century, I shall have a story to tell which must inspire\r\nhope in all who can be persuaded that Ireland in the past has not often\r\nbeen treated fairly and has never been understood. I have shown--and it\r\nwas necessary to show, if a repetition of misunderstanding was to be\r\navoided--that the Irish people themselves are gravely responsible for\r\nthe ills of their country, and that the forces which have mainly\r\ngoverned their action hitherto are rapidly bringing about their\r\ndisappearance as a distinct nationality. But I shall now have to tell of\r\nthe widespread and growing adoption of certain new principles of action\r\nwhich I believe to be consonant with the genius and traditions of the\r\nrace, and the acceptance of which seems to me vitally necessary if the\r\nIrish people are to play a worthy part in the future history of the\r\nworld. That part is a far greater one than they could ever hope to play\r\nas an independent and separate State, yet their success in playing it\r\nmust closely depend upon their remaining a distinct nationality, in the\r\nsense so clearly and wisely indicated by his Majesty when, in his reply\r\nto the address of the Belfast Corporation, he spoke of the 'national\r\ncharacteristics and ideals' which he desired his kingdoms to cherish in\r\nthe midst of their imperial unity.[36] The great experiment which I am\r\nabout to relate is, in its own province, one of the many applications\r\nwhich we see around us of the conception here put forward. And I believe\r\nthat a few more years of quiet work by those who are taking part in this\r\nmovement, with its appeal to Irish intellect, and its reliance upon\r\nIrish patriotism, is all that is needed to prove that by developing the\r\nindustrial qualities of the Celt on associative lines we can in politics\r\nas well as in economics, add strength to the Irish character without\r\nmaking it less Irish or less attractive than of old.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[28] This body is fully described in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n[29] See Appendix to Third Report, p. 311.\r\n\r\n[30] _The Damnation of Theron Ware_. This was the title of the book I\r\nread in the United States. I am told he published it in England under\r\nthe title of _Illuminations_--a nice discrimination!\r\n\r\n[31] They appeared under the signature of 'X.' in Nov. and Dec., 1893,\r\nand Jan., 1894.\r\n\r\n[32] _Fortnightly Review_, Jan. 1894, pp. 11, 12.\r\n\r\n[33] The difficulties of the writer who is not a writer are great. I\r\nsent this chapter to two literary friends, one of whom, with the help of\r\na globe, disputed my accuracy in a learned ethnological disquisition\r\nwith which he favoured me. The other warned me to be even more obscure\r\nand sent me the following verses, addressed by 'Cynicus' (J.K. Stephen)\r\nto Shakespeare,\r\n\r\n\"You wrote a line too much, my sage, Of seers the first, the first of\r\nsayers; For only half the world's a stage, And only all the women\r\nplayers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[34] These qualities, as will be explained later, happen to have a\r\nspecial economic value in the farming industry, and so are available for\r\nthe elevation of rural life, with whose problems we are now so deeply\r\nconcerned in Ireland. Their applicability to urban life need not be\r\ndiscussed here. But my study of the co-operative movement in England has\r\nconvinced me that, if the English had the associative instincts of the\r\nIrish, that movement would play a part in English life more commensurate\r\nwith its numerical strength and the volume of its commercial\r\ntransactions, than can be claimed for it so far.\r\n\r\n[35] _La Psychologie de la Foule_.\r\n\r\n[36] July 27th, 1903,--His Majesty thus confirmed the striking utterance\r\nof imperial policy contained in Lord Dudley's speech to the Incorporated\r\nLaw Society, on the 20th of November, 1902.

I shall eagerly await the fulfilment of\r\nthis hope. Its realisation will, under Divine Providence, depend largely\r\nupon the steady development of self-reliance and co-operation, upon\r\nbetter and more practical education, upon the growth of industrial and\r\ncommercial enterprise, and upon that increase of mutual toleration and\r\nrespect which the responsibility my Irish people now enjoy in the public\r\nadministration of their local affairs is well-fitted to\r\nteach.\"--_Message of the King to the Irish People_, 1st August, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW MOVEMENT: ITS FOUNDATION ON SELF-HELP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe movement for the reorganisation of Irish agricultural and industrial\r\nlife, to which I have already frequently referred, must now be described\r\nin practical operation. Before I do this, however, there are two lines\r\nof criticism which the very mention of a new movement may suggest, and\r\nwhich I must anticipate. Every year has its tale of new movements,\r\nlaunched by estimable persons whose philanthropic zeal is not balanced\r\nby the judgment required to discriminate between schemes which possess\r\nthe elements of permanence, and those which depend upon the enthusiasm\r\nor financial support of their promoters, and are in their nature\r\nephemeral. There is, consequently, a widespread and well justified\r\nmistrust of novel schemes for the industrial regeneration of Ireland. I\r\nconfess to having had my ingenuity severely taxed on some occasions to\r\nfind a sympathetic circumlocution wherewith to show cause for declining\r\nto join a new movement, my real reason being an inward conviction that\r\nnothing except resolutions would be moved. In the complex problem of\r\nbuilding up the economic and social life of a people with such a\r\nhistory as ours, we must resist the temptation to multiply schemes\r\nwhich, however well intended, are but devices for enabling individuals\r\nto devolve their responsibilities upon the community or upon the\r\nGovernment, and which owe their bubble reputation and brief popularity\r\nto this unconscious humouring of our chief national defect. On the\r\ncontrary, we must seek to instil into the mind of each individual the\r\ntoo little recognised importance of his own contribution to the sum of\r\nnational achievement. The building of character must be our paramount\r\nobject, as it is the condition precedent of all social and economic\r\nreform in Ireland. To explain the principles by the observance of which\r\nthe agency of the association may be utilised as an economic force,\r\nwhile at the same time the industrial character of the individual may be\r\ndeveloped, was one of the chief aims I had in view in the foregoing\r\nanalysis of the Irish mind and character, as they have emerged from\r\nhistory and are stunted in their growth by present influences. The facts\r\nabout to be recited will, I hope, suffice to prove that the reformer in\r\nIreland, if he has a true insight into the great human problem with\r\nwhich he is dealing, may find in the association not only a healthy\r\nstimulus to national activities, but also a means whereby the assistance\r\nof the State may be so invoked and applied that it will concentrate, and\r\nnot dissipate, the energies of the people.\r\n\r\nThe other criticism which I think it necessary to anticipate would, if\r\nignored, leave room for a wrong impression as to much of the work which\r\nis being done both on the self-help and on the State-aid sides of the\r\nnew movement. Education, it will be said, is the only real solvent to\r\nthe range of problems discussed in this book, most other agencies of\r\nsocial and economic reform being of doubtful efficacy and, if they tend\r\nto postpone educational effort, positively harmful. There is much truth\r\nin this view. But it must be remembered that the backward condition of\r\nour economic life is due mainly to the fact that our educational systems\r\nhave had little regard to our history or economic circumstances. We\r\nmust, therefore, at this stage in our national development give to\r\neducation a much wider interpretation than that which is usually applied\r\nto the term. We cannot wait for a generation to grow up which has been\r\ngiven an education calculated to fit it for the modern economic\r\nstruggle, even if there were any probability that the necessary reforms\r\nwould soon be carried against the prejudices which are aroused by any\r\nproposal to train the minds, or even the hands and eyes, of the rising\r\ngeneration. In the meantime much of the work, both voluntary and\r\nState-aided, now initiated in Ireland, must consist of educating adults\r\nto introduce into their business concerns the more advanced economic and\r\nscientific methods which the superior education of our rivals in\r\nagriculture and industry abroad has enabled them to adopt, and which my\r\nexperience of Irish work convinces me our people would have adopted long\r\nago if they had had similar educational advantages. And I would further\r\npoint out that there is no better way of promoting the reform of\r\neducation in the ordinary, the pedagogic, sense, than by bringing to\r\nbear upon the minds of parents those educational influences which are\r\ncalculated to convince them of the advantage of improved practical\r\neducation for their children. So to the economist and to the\r\neducationist alike I would submit that the new work of economic and\r\nsocial reform should be judged as a whole, and not prejudged by that\r\nhypercriticism of details which ignores the fact that the conditions\r\nwith which it is attempted to deal are wholly unprecedented. I am quite\r\ncontent that the movement which I am about to describe should be\r\nultimately known and judged by its fruits. Meanwhile, I think that to\r\nthe intelligent critic it will sufficiently justify its existence if it\r\ncontinues to exist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe story of the new movement, which must now be told, begins in the\r\nyear 1889, when a few Irishmen, the writer of these pages among them,\r\nset themselves the task of bringing home to the rural population of\r\nIreland the fact that their prosperity was in their own hands much more\r\nthan they were generally led to believe. I have already pointed out that\r\nin order to direct the Irish mind towards practical affairs and in order\r\neffectively to arouse and apply the latent capacities of the Irish\r\npeople to their chief industry, agriculture, we must rely upon\r\nassociative, as distinct from individual effort; or, in other words, we\r\nmust get the people to do their business together rather than\r\nseparately as the English do. Fortunately for us, it happened that this\r\ncourse, which was clearly indicated by the character and temperament of\r\nthe people, was equally prescribed by economic considerations. The\r\npopulation and wealth of Ireland are, I need hardly say, so\r\npredominantly agricultural that the welfare of the country must depend\r\nupon the welfare of the farming classes. It is notorious that the\r\nindustry by which these classes live has for the last quarter of a\r\ncentury become less and less profitable. It is also recognised that the\r\nprime cause of agricultural depression, foreign competition, is not\r\nlikely to be removed, while that from the colonies is likely to\r\nincrease. The extraordinary development of rapid and cheap transit,\r\ntogether with recently invented processes of preservation, have enabled\r\nthe more favoured producers in the newly developed countries of both\r\nhemispheres successfully to enter into competition in the British\r\nmarkets with the farmers of these islands. The agricultural producers in\r\nother European countries, although to some extent protected by tariffs,\r\nhave had to face similar conditions; but in most of these countries,\r\nthough not in the United Kingdom, the farmers have so changed their\r\nmethods, to meet the altered circumstances, that they seem to have\r\ngained by improvement at home as much as they have lost by competition\r\nfrom abroad Thus our farmers find themselves harassed first by the\r\ncheaper production from vast tracts of virgin soil in the uttermost\r\nparts of the earth, and secondly by a nearer and keener competition\r\nfrom the better organised and better educated producers of the\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nWhile the opening up of what the economists call the 'world market,' has\r\nnecessitated, as a condition of successful competition, improved methods\r\nof production for, and carriage to, the market, a third and less obvious\r\nforce has effected an important change in the method of distribution in\r\nthe market. The swarming populations, which the factory system has\r\nbrought together in industrial centres, have to be supplied with food by\r\na system of distribution which must above all things be expeditious.\r\nThis requirement can only be met by the regular consignment of food in\r\nlarge quantities, of such uniform quality that the sample can be relied\r\nupon to be truly indicative of the quality of the bulk. Thus the rapid\r\ndistribution of produce in the markets becomes as important a factor in\r\nagricultural economy as improved methods of production or cheap and\r\nexpeditious carriage.\r\n\r\nNow this new market condition is being met in two ways. In the United\r\nStates, and, in a less marked degree, at home, an army of middlemen\r\nbetween the producer and the consumer attends to this business for a\r\nshare of the profits accruing from it, whilst in many parts of the\r\nContinent the farmers themselves attend, partially at any rate, to the\r\nbusiness side of their industry instead of paying others to do it all\r\nfor them. I say all, for middlemen are necessary at the distributive\r\nend: but it is absolutely essential, in a country like Ireland, that at\r\nthe producing end the farmers should be so organised that they\r\nthemselves can manage the first stages of distribution, and exercise\r\nsome control over the middlemen who do the rest. The foreign\r\nagricultural producers have long been alive to this necessity, for their\r\nsuperior education enabled them to grasp the economic situation and even\r\nto realise that the matter is not one of acute political controversy.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was a definite practical problem to the solution of which\r\nthe promoters of the new movement could apply their principle of\r\nco-operative effort. The more we studied the question the more apparent\r\nit became that the enormous advantage which the Continental farmers had\r\nover the Irish farmers, both in production and in distribution, was due\r\nto superior organisation combined with better education. State-aid had\r\nno doubt done a great deal abroad, but in every case it was manifest\r\nthat it had been preceded, or at least accompanied, by the organised\r\nvoluntary effort without which the interference of the Government with\r\nthe business of the people is simply demoralising.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the task before us in Ireland was the adaptation to\r\nthe special circumstances of our country of methods successfully pursued\r\nby communities similarly situated in foreign countries. We had to urge\r\nupon farmers that combination was just as necessary to their economic\r\nsalvation as it was recognised to be by their own class, and by those\r\nengaged in other industries, elsewhere. They must combine, so we urged\r\non them, for example, to buy their agricultural requirements at the\r\ncheapest rate and of the best quality in order to produce more\r\nefficiently and more economically; they must combine to avail themselves\r\nof improved appliances beyond the reach of individual producers, whether\r\nit be by the erection of creameries, for which there was urgent need, or\r\nof cheese factories and jam factories which might come later; or in\r\nordinary farm operations, to secure the use of the latest agricultural\r\nmachinery and the most suitable pure-bred stock; they must combine--not\r\nto abolish middle profits in distribution, whether those of the carrying\r\ncompanies or those of the dealers in agricultural produce--but to keep\r\nthose profits within reasonable limits, and to collect in bulk and\r\nregularise consignments so that they could be carried and marketed at a\r\nmoderate cost; they must combine, as we afterwards learned, for the\r\npurpose of creating, by mutual support, the credit required to bring in\r\nthe fresh working capital which each new development of their industry\r\nwould demand and justify. In short, whenever and wherever the\r\nindividuals in a farming community could be brought to see that they\r\nmight advantageously substitute associated for isolated production or\r\ndistribution, they must be taught to form themselves into associations\r\nin order to reap the anticipated advantages.\r\n\r\nThis brief statement of our general aims will furnish a rough idea of\r\nthe economic propaganda which we initiated, and if I give a few\r\nillustrations of the practical application of the new principle to the\r\nfarming industry, I shall have done all that will be required to leave\r\non the reader's mind a true though perhaps an incomplete impression of\r\nthe character and scope of the self-help side of the new movement. I\r\nshall first give a sketch of the unrecorded struggles of its pioneers,\r\nbecause these struggles prove to those engaged in social and economic\r\nwork in Ireland that, in the wholly abnormal condition of our national\r\nlife, no project which is theoretically sound need be rejected because\r\neverybody says it is impracticable. The work of the morrow will largely\r\nconsist of the impossible of to-day. If this adds to the difficulty, it\r\nalso adds to the fun.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the conclusion that the introduction of the principle\r\nof agricultural co-operation was a vital necessity, the first practical\r\nquestion which had to be decided was how the industrial army, which was\r\nto do battle for Ireland's position in the world market, should be\r\norganised and disciplined for the task. It is evident that before a body\r\nof men who have never worked together can form a successful commercial\r\ncombination, they must be provided with a constitution and set of rules\r\nand regulations for the conduct of their business. These must be so\r\nskilfully contrived that they will harmonise all the interests involved.\r\nAnd when an arrangement has been come to which is, not only in fact but\r\nalso obviously, equitable, it remains as part of the process of\r\norganisation to teach the participants in the new project the meaning,\r\nand to imbue them with the spirit, of the joint enterprise into which\r\nthey have been persuaded to enter with perhaps no very clear\r\nunderstanding of all that is involved. There were in Ireland no\r\nprecedents to guide us and no examples to follow, but the co-operative\r\nmovement in England appeared to furnish most of the principles involved\r\nand a perfect machinery for their application.[37] So Lord Monteagle and\r\nMr. R.A. Anderson, my first two associates in the New Movement, joined\r\nme as regular attendants at the annual Co-operative congresses. We were\r\nassiduous seekers after information at the head-quarters of the\r\nCo-operative Union in Manchester. We had the good fortune to fall in\r\nwith Vansittart Neale, and Tom Hughes, both of whom have passed away,\r\nand with Mr. Holyoake, who, with the exception of Mr. Ludlow, is now the\r\nsole survivor of that noble group of practical philanthropists, the\r\nChristian Socialists. Mr. J.C. Gray, who succeeded Mr. Vansittart Neale\r\nas the General Secretary of the Co-operative Union, gave us invaluable\r\nhelp and continues to do so to this day. The leaders of the English\r\nmovement sympathised with our efforts. The Union paid us the compliment\r\nof constituting our first converts its Irish Section. Liberal support\r\nwas given out of the central English funds towards the cost of the\r\nmissionary work which was to spread co-operative light in the sister\r\nisle. We can never forget the generosity of the workingmen in England in\r\ngiving their aid to the Irish farmers, especially when it is remembered\r\nthat they had no sanguine anticipations for the success of our efforts\r\nand no prospect of advantages to themselves if we did succeed.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the outlook was not altogether rosy.\r\nAgricultural co-operation had never succeeded in England, where it\r\nseemed to be accepted as one of the disappointing limitations of the\r\nco-operative movement that it did not apply to rural communities in\r\nthese islands. There were also in Ireland the peculiar difficulties\r\narising from ceaseless political and agrarian agitation. It was\r\nnaturally asked--did Irish farmers possess the qualities out of which\r\nco-operators are made? Had they commercial experience or business\r\neducation? Had they business capacity? Would they display that\r\nconfidence in each other which is essential to successful association,\r\nor indeed that confidence in themselves without which there can be no\r\nbusiness enterprise? Could they ever be induced to form themselves into\r\nsocieties, and to adopt, and loyally adhere to those rules and\r\nregulations by which alone equitable distribution of the responsibility\r\nand profit among the participants in the joint undertaking can be\r\nassured, and harmony and successful working be rendered possible? Then,\r\nour best-informed Irish critics assured us that voluntary association\r\nfor humdrum business purposes, devoid of some religious or political\r\nincentive, was alien to the Celtic temperament and that we should wear\r\nourselves out crying in the wilderness. We were told that Irishmen can\r\nconspire but cannot combine. Economists assured us that even if we\r\nsucceeded in getting farmers to embark on the projected enterprises,\r\nfinancial disaster would be the inevitable result of our attempts to\r\nsubstitute in industrial undertakings, ever becoming more technical and\r\nrequiring more and more commercial knowledge and experience, democratic\r\nmanagement for one-man control.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand there were some favouring conditions, the importance\r\nof which our studies of the human problems already discussed will have\r\nmade my readers realise. Isolated, the Irish farmer is conservative,\r\nsceptical of innovations, a believer in routine and tradition. In union\r\nwith his fellows, he is progressive, open to ideas, and wonderfully keen\r\nat grasping the essential features of any new proposal for his\r\nadvancement. He was, then, himself eminently a subject for co-operative\r\ntreatment, and his circumstances were equally so. The smallness of his\r\nholding, the lack of capital, and the backwardness of his methods made\r\nhim helpless in competition with his rivals abroad. The process of\r\norganisation was also, to some extent, facilitated by the insight the\r\npeople had been given by the Land League into the power of combination,\r\nand by the education they had received in the conduct of meetings. It\r\nwas a great advantage that there was a machinery ready at hand for\r\ngetting people together, and a procedure fully understood for giving\r\nexpression to the sense of the meeting. On the other hand, the\r\ndomination of a powerful central body, which was held to be essential to\r\nthe success of the political and agrarian movement, had exercised an\r\ninfluence which added enormously to the difficulty of getting the people\r\nto act on their own initiative.\r\n\r\nThough the economic conditions of the Irish farmer clearly indicated a\r\nneed for the application of co-operative effort to all branches of his\r\nindustry, it was necessary at the beginning to embrace a more limited\r\naim. It happened at the time we commenced our Irish work that one branch\r\nof farming, the dairying industry, presented features admirably adapted\r\nto our methods. This industry was, so to speak, ripe for its industrial\r\ndevelopment, for its change from a home to a factory industry. New\r\nmachinery, costly but highly efficient, had enabled the factory product,\r\nnotably that of Denmark and Sweden, to compete successfully with the\r\nhome-made article, both in quality and cost of production. Here, it will\r\nbe observed, was an opportunity for an experiment in co-operative\r\nproduction, under modern industrial conditions, which would put the\r\nassociative qualities of the Irish farmer to a test which the British\r\nartisan had not stood quite as well as the founders of the co-operative\r\nmovement had anticipated. To add to the interest of the situation,\r\ncapitalists had seized upon the material advantages which the abundant\r\nsupply of Irish milk afforded, and the green pastures of the \"Golden\r\nVein\" were studded with snow white creameries which proclaimed the\r\ntransfer of this great Irish industry from the tiller of the soil to the\r\nman of commerce. The new-comers secured the milk of the district by\r\ngiving the farmer much more for his milk than it was worth to him, so\r\nlong as he pursued the old methods of home manufacture. This induced\r\nfarmers to go out of the butter-making business. After a while the price\r\nwas reduced, and the proprietor, finding it necessary to give the\r\nsuppliers only what they could make out of their milk without his modern\r\nequipment, realised profits altogether out of proportion to his share of\r\nthe capital embarked or the labour involved in the production of the\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\nThe economic position was ideal for our purpose, and we had no\r\ndifficulty in explaining it to the farmers themselves. The social\r\nproblem was the real difficulty. To all suggestions of co-operative\r\naction they at first opposed a hopeless _non possumus_. Their objections\r\nmay be summed up thus:--They had never combined for any business\r\npurpose. How could they trust the Committee they were asked to elect\r\nfrom amongst themselves to expend their money and conduct their\r\nbusiness? It was all very well for the proprietor with his ample\r\ncapital, free hand, and business experience, to work with complicated\r\nmachinery and to consign his butter out of the reach of the local butter\r\nbuyer, and to save the waste and delay of the local butter market. But\r\nthey knew nothing of the business and would only make fools of\r\nthemselves. The promoters--they were not putting anything into the\r\nscheme--how much did they intend to take out?[38]\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in this attitude of mind which we had not fully\r\nanticipated. We were confident that, as we were on sound economic\r\nground, no matter what difficulties might confront us it was only a\r\nquestion of time for the attainment of our ends. All that was required\r\nwas that we should keep pegging away. My own experience was not\r\nencouraging at first. I was, and am, a poor speaker, and in Ireland a\r\nman who cannot express his thoughts with facility, whether he has got\r\nthem or not, accentuates the difficulties under which a prophet labours\r\nin his own country. I made up for my deficiencies in the first essential\r\nof Irish public life by engaging a very eloquent political speaker, the\r\nlate Mr. Mulhallen Marum, M.P., to stump the country. He gave to the\r\npropaganda a relish which my prosaic economics altogether lacked. The\r\nnationalist band sometimes came out to meet him. We all know the\r\nefficiency of the drum in politics and religion, but it seemed to me a\r\nlittle out of place in economics. However, he created an excellent\r\nimpression, but unhappily he died of heart disease before he had\r\nattended more than three or four meetings. This was a severe blow to us,\r\nand we toiled away under some temporary discouragement. My own diary\r\nrecords attendance at fifty meetings before a single society had\r\nresulted therefrom. It was weary work for a long time. These gatherings\r\nwere miserable affairs compared with those which greeted our political\r\nspeakers. On one occasion the agricultural community was represented by\r\nthe Dispensary Doctor, the Schoolmaster, and the Sergeant of Police.\r\nSometimes, in spite of copious advertising of the meeting, the prosaic\r\nnature of the objects had got abroad, and nobody met.\r\n\r\nMr. Anderson, who sometimes accompanied me and sometimes went his rounds\r\nalone, had similar experiences. I may quote a passage from some of his\r\nreminiscences, recently published in the _Irish Homestead_, the organ of\r\nthe co-operative movement in Ireland.\r\n\r\n     It was hard and thankless work. There was the apathy of the people\r\n     and the active opposition of the Press and the politicians. It\r\n     would be hard to say now whether the abuse of the Conservative\r\n     _Cork Constitution_ or that of the Nationalist _Eagle_, of\r\n     Skibbereen, was the louder. We were \"killing the calves,\" we were\r\n     \"forcing the young women to emigrate,\" we were \"destroying the\r\n     industry.\" Mr. Plunkett was described as a \"monster in human\r\n     shape,\" and was adjured to \"cease his hellish work.\" I was\r\n     described as his \"Man Friday\" and as \"Rough-rider Anderson.\" Once,\r\n     when I thought I had planted a Creamery within the precincts of the\r\n     town of Rathkeale, my co-operative apple-cart was upset by a local\r\n     solicitor who, having elicited the fact that our movement\r\n     recognised neither political nor religious differences--that the\r\n     Unionist-Protestant cow was as dear to us as her\r\n     Nationalist-Catholic sister--gravely informed me that our programme\r\n     would not suit Rathkeale. \"Rathkeale,\" said he, pompously, \"is a\r\n     Nationalist town--Nationalist to the backbone--and every pound of\r\n     butter made in this Creamery must be made on Nationalist\r\n     principles, or it shan't be made at all.\" This sentiment was\r\n     applauded loudly, and the proceedings terminated.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion a similar project was abandoned because the flow of\r\nwater to the disused mill which it was proposed to convert into a\r\ncreamery, passed through a conduit lined with cement originally\r\npurchased from a man who now occupied a farm from which another had been\r\nevicted. To some minds these little complications would have spelled\r\nfailure. To my associates they but accentuated the need for the movement\r\nwhich they had so laboriously thought out, and the very nature of the\r\ndifficulties confirmed them in their belief that the economic doctrine\r\nthey were preaching was adapted to meet the requirements of the case.\r\nAnd so the event proved.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1894 the movement had gathered volume to such an\r\nextent--although the societies then numbered but one for every twenty\r\nthat are in existence to-day--that it became beyond the power of a few\r\nindividuals to direct its further progress. In April of that year a\r\nmeeting was held in Dublin to inaugurate the Irish Agricultural\r\nOrganisation Society, Ltd. (now commonly known as the I.A.O.S.), which\r\nwas to be the analogue of the Co-operative Union in England. In the\r\nfirst instance it was to consist of philanthropic persons, but its\r\nconstitution provided for the inclusion in its membership of the\r\nsocieties which had already been created and those which it would itself\r\ncreate as time went on. It had, and has to-day, a thoroughly\r\nrepresentative Committee. I was elected the first President, a position\r\nwhich I held until I entered official life, when Lord Monteagle, a\r\npractical philanthropist if ever there was one, became my successor.\r\nFather Finlay, who joined the movement in 1892, and who has devoted the\r\nextraordinary influence which he possesses over the rural population of\r\nIreland to the dissemination of our economic principles, became\r\nVice-President. Both he and Lord Monteagle have been annually re-elected\r\never since.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the movement in the last nine years under the fostering\r\ncare of the I.A.O.S. is highly satisfactory. By the autumn of this year\r\n(1903) considerably over eight hundred societies had been established,\r\nand the number is ever growing; of these 360 were dairy, and 140\r\nagricultural societies, nearly 200 agricultural banks, 50 home\r\nindustries societies, 40 poultry societies, while there were 40 others\r\nwith miscellaneous objects. The membership may be estimated--I am\r\nwriting towards the end of the Society's statistical year--at about\r\n80,000, representing some 400,000 persons. The combined trade turnover\r\nof these societies during the present year will reach approximately\r\n£2,000,000, a figure the meaning of which can only be appreciated when\r\nit is remembered that the great majority of the associated farmers are\r\nin so small a way of business that in England they would hardly be\r\nclassed as farmers at all.\r\n\r\nThese societies consist, as has been explained, of groups of farmers who\r\nhave been taught by organisers that certain branches of their business\r\ncan be more profitably conducted in association than by individuals\r\nacting separately. The principle of agricultural co-operation with its\r\neconomic advantages will, as time goes on, be further extended by the\r\ncombined action of societies. With this end in view federations are\r\nconstantly being formed with a constitution similar to that of the\r\nsocieties, the only difference being that the members of the federation\r\nare not individuals but societies, the government of the central body\r\nbeing carried on by delegates from its constituent associations. The two\r\nlargest of these federations, one for the sale of butter, and another\r\nfor the combined purchase by societies of their agricultural\r\nrequirements, have been working successfully for several years.\r\nFederations, too, are being formed, as societies find that their\r\nbusiness can be conducted more economically, for example, in dairying by\r\ncentralising the manufacture of butter, or in the egg export trade by\r\nthe alliance of many districts to enable large contracts to be\r\nundertaken. In the near future a further development of federation will\r\nbe required to complete a scheme now under consideration for the mutual\r\ninsurance of live stock. Such a scheme involves the existence of two\r\nprime conditions, a local organisation for the purpose of effective\r\nsupervision, and the spreading of the risk over a large area.\r\n\r\nIn all such enterprises and economic changes the Organisation Society is\r\neither the initiator, or is called in for advice, and its continued\r\nexistence in a purely advisory capacity as a link between the societies\r\nwhere concerted action is required, will be necessary even when the\r\norganisation of farmers into societies is completed. The economic life\r\nof rural communities is in continual need of adjustment. Now it is an\r\ninvention like a steam separator which revolutionises an industry. At\r\nanother time the crisis created by a change in the tariff of a foreign\r\ncountry forces the producer either to find a new outlet for his wares,\r\nor to abandon a hitherto profitable employment. A striking instance of\r\nthe value of organisation and connection with a central advisory body\r\noccurred in 1887, when swine fever broke out in Denmark, and the exports\r\nof live swine fell from 230,000 in one year to 16,000 in the next. The\r\norganisation of the farmers, however, enabled them easily to consult\r\ntogether how best to meet the emergency, and their decision to start\r\nco-operative bacon-curing factories was the foundation of their present\r\ngreat export trade in manufactured bacon.\r\n\r\nI must not overburden with details a narrative intended for readers to\r\nwhom I merely wish to give a deeper and wider understanding of Irish\r\nlife than most of them probably possess. But there is just one form of\r\nagricultural co-operation to which I can usefully devote a few\r\nparagraphs, because it throws much light upon the associative qualities\r\nof the people and also upon the educational and social value of the\r\nmovement. I refer to the Agricultural Banks, more properly called Credit\r\nAssociations, which have been organised upon the Raiffeisen system.\r\nBefore the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society was formed we had\r\nread of these institutions, and of the marvellously beneficial effect\r\nthey had produced upon the most depressed rural communities abroad. But\r\nonly in the last few years have we fully realised that they are even\r\nmore required and are likely to do more good in Ireland than in any\r\nother country; for on the psychological side of our work we formerly but\r\ndimly saw things which we now see clearly.\r\n\r\nThe exact purpose of these organisations is to create credit as a means\r\nof introducing capital into the agricultural industry. They perform the\r\napparent miracle of giving solvency to a community composed almost\r\nentirely of insolvent individuals. The constitution of these bodies,\r\nwhich can, of course, be described only in broad outline here, is\r\nsomewhat startling. They have no subscribed capital, but every member is\r\nliable for the entire debts of the association. Consequently the\r\nassociation takes good care to admit men of approved character and\r\ncapacity only. It starts by borrowing a sum of money on the joint and\r\nseveral security of its members. A member wishing to borrow from the\r\nassociation is not required to give tangible security, but must bring\r\ntwo sureties. He fills up an application form which states, among other\r\nthings, what he wants the money for. The rules provide--and this is the\r\nsalient feature of the system--that a loan shall be made for a\r\nproductive purpose only, that is, a purpose which, in the judgment of\r\nthe other members of the association as represented by a committee\r\ndemocratically elected from among themselves, will enable the borrower\r\nto repay the loan out of the results of the use made of the money lent.\r\n\r\nRaiffeisen held, and our experience in Ireland has fully confirmed his\r\nopinion, that in the poorest communities there is a perfectly safe basis\r\nof security in the honesty and industry of its members. This security is\r\nnot valuable to the ordinary commercial lender, such as the local joint\r\nstock bank. Even if such lenders had the intimate knowledge possessed by\r\nthe committee of one of these associations as to the character and\r\ncapacity of the borrower, they would not be able to satisfy themselves\r\nthat the loan was required for a really productive purpose, nor would\r\nthey be able to see that it was properly applied to the stipulated\r\nobject. One of the rules of the co-operative banks provides for the\r\nexpulsion of a member who does not apply the money to the agreed\r\nproductive purpose. But although these \"Banks\" are almost invariably\r\nsituated in very poor districts, there has been no necessity to put this\r\nrule in force in a single instance. Social influences seem to be quite\r\nsufficient to secure obedience to the association's laws.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage conferred by the association is that the term for\r\nwhich money is advanced is a matter of agreement between the borrower\r\nand the bank. The hard and fast term of three months which prevails in\r\nIreland for small loans is unsuited to the requirements of the\r\nagricultural industry--as for instance, when a man borrows money to sow\r\na crop, and has to repay it before harvest. The society borrows at four\r\nor five per cent, and lends at five or six per cent. In some cases the\r\nCongested Districts Board or the Department of Agriculture have made\r\nloans to these banks at three per cent. This enables the societies to\r\nlend at the popular rate of one penny for the use of one pound for a\r\nmonth. The expenses of administration are very small. As the credit of\r\nthese associations develops, they will become a depository for the\r\nsavings of the community, to the great advantage of both lender and\r\nborrower. The latter generally makes an enormous profit out of these\r\nloans, which have accordingly gained the name of 'the lucky money,' and\r\nwe find, in practice, that he always repays the association and almost\r\ninvariably with punctuality.\r\n\r\nThe sketch I have given of the agricultural banks will, perhaps, be\r\nsufficient to show what an immense educational and economic benefit they\r\nare likely to confer when they are widely extended throughout Ireland,\r\nas I hope they will be in the near future. Under this system, which, to\r\nquote the report of the Indian Famine Commission, 1901, 'separates the\r\nworking bees from the drones,' the industrious men of the community who\r\nhad no clear idea before of the meaning or functions of capital or\r\ncredit, and who were generally unable to get capital into their industry\r\nexcept at exorbitant rates of interest and upon unsuitable terms, are\r\nnow able to get, not always, indeed, all the money they want, but all\r\nthe money they can well employ for the improvement of their industry.\r\nThere is no fear of rash investment of capital in enterprises believed\r\nto be, but not in reality productive--the committee take good care of\r\nthat. The whole community is taught the difference between borrowing to\r\nspend and borrowing to make. You have the collective wisdom of the best\r\nmen in the association helping the borrower to decide whether he ought\r\nto borrow or not, and then assisting him, if only from motives of\r\nself-interest, to make the loan fulfil the purpose for which it was\r\nmade. I was delighted to find when I was making an enquiry into the\r\nworking of the system that, whereas the debt-laden peasants had formerly\r\nconcealed their indebtedness, of which they were ashamed, those who were\r\nin debt to the new banks were proud of the fact, as it was the best\r\ntestimonial to their character for honesty and industry.[39]\r\n\r\nOne other sphere of activity worked by the co-operative associations\r\nneeds a passing notice. The desire that, together with material\r\namelioration, there should be a corresponding intellectual advancement\r\nand a greater beauty in life has prompted many of the farmers' societies\r\nto use their organisation for higher ends. A considerable number of them\r\nhave started Village Libraries, and by an admirable selection of books\r\nhave brought to their members, not only the means of educating\r\nthemselves in the more difficult technical problems of their industry,\r\nbut also a means of access to that enchanted world of Irish thought\r\nwhich inspires the Gaelic Revival to which I have already referred.\r\nSocial gatherings of every kind, dances, lectures, concerts, and such\r\nlike entertainments, which have the two-fold effect of brightening rural\r\nlife and increasing the attachment of the members to their society, are\r\nbecoming a common feature in the movement, and this more human aspect\r\nhas attracted to it the attention of many who do not understand its\r\neconomic side. We have gratifying evidence from many of the clergy that\r\nthe movement thus developed has kept at home young people who would\r\notherwise have fled from the continued hardship and intellectual\r\nemptiness of rural life at home.\r\n\r\nThese results are in no small measure due to the zeal and devotion of\r\nthe governing body and staff of the I.A.O.S. The general policy of the\r\nsociety is guided by a committee of twenty-four members, one-half of\r\nwhom are elected by the individual subscribers and the other half by the\r\naffiliated societies. It is representative in the best sense and\r\ninfluential accordingly. The success of the Committee is no doubt mainly\r\ndue to the wisdom which they have displayed in the selection of the\r\nstaff. In the most important post, that of Secretary, they have kept on\r\nmy chief fellow-worker in the early struggle, Mr. R.A. Anderson, who has\r\ndevoted himself to the cause with all the energy of a nature at once\r\nenthusiastic, unselfish, and practical, and who has succeeded in\r\ninspiring his staff of organisers and experts with his own spirit. Among\r\nthese, two deserve special mention, Mr. George W. Russell, one of the\r\nAssistant Secretaries, who has, under the _nom de plume_ \"A.E.,\"\r\nattained fame for a poetry of rare distinction of thought and diction,\r\nand Mr. P.J. Hannon, the other Assistant Secretary, who has proved\r\nhimself a splendid propagandist. Each of these gentlemen has brought to\r\nthe movement a zeal and ability which could only come of a devotion to\r\nhigh ideals of patriotism, curiously combined with a shrewd practical\r\ninstinct for carrying on varied and responsible business undertakings.\r\n\r\nWith the growing work the staff has been repeatedly augmented to enable\r\nthe central society to keep pace with the demand made by groups of\r\nfarmers to be initiated into the principles of co-operative\r\norganisation and the details of its application to the particular\r\nbranches of farming carried on in their several districts. At the same\r\ntime the societies which have been established need, during their\r\nearlier years, and with each extension of their operations, constant\r\nadvice and supervision. Hence skilled organisers have to be kept to form\r\nco-operative dairy societies, inspect creameries, and give technical\r\nadvice upon the manufacture and sale of butter, the care of machinery,\r\nthe adequacy of the water supply, the drainage system, and many similar\r\ntechnical questions. Others are employed to start poultry societies,\r\nwhich when organised have still to be instructed by a Danish expert in\r\nthe proper method of packing, selecting, and grading the eggs for\r\nexport. In tillage districts there is a constant demand for organisers\r\nof purely agricultural societies, which aim at the joint purchase of\r\nseeds and manures, of implements and other farm requisites, and at the\r\nbetter disposal of produce; while the growing importance of an improved\r\nsystem of agricultural credit keeps four organisers of agricultural\r\nbanks constantly at work Home industries, bee-keeping, and horticulture,\r\nmay be added to the objects for which societies have been formed and\r\nwhich require separate expert organisers. And in addition to all this\r\nwork, the central association has found it necessary to keep a staff of\r\naccountants, versed in the principles of co-operative organisation, to\r\ninstruct these miscellaneous societies in simple and efficient systems\r\nof bookkeeping, and in the general principles of conducting business.\r\nTo complete the description of the propagandist activities of the\r\ncentral body, there is a ceaseless flow of leaflets and circulars\r\ncontaining advice and direction to bodies of farmers who, for the first\r\ntime in their lives, have combined for business purposes; while a little\r\nweekly paper, the _Irish Homestead_, acts as the organ of the movement,\r\npromotes the exchange of ideas between societies scattered throughout\r\nthe country, furnishes useful information upon all matters connected\r\nwith their business operations, and keeps constantly before the\r\nassociated farmers the economic principles which must be observed, and,\r\nabove all, the spirit in which the work must be approached, if the\r\nmovement is to fulfil its mission.[40]\r\n\r\nOne of the difficulties incidental to a movement of this kind, which,\r\nfor the reasons already set forth, had to be rapidly and widely\r\nextended, was the enormous cost to its supporters. It is needless to say\r\nthat such a staff as I have described could not be kept continuously\r\ntravelling by rail and road for so many years without the provision of a\r\nlarge fund. These officers must obviously be men with exceptional\r\nqualifications, if they are not only to impress the thought of their\r\nagricultural audiences, but also to move them to action, and to sustain\r\nthe newly organised societies through the initial difficulties of their\r\nunfamiliar enterprise. Such men are not to be found idle, and if they\r\npreach this gospel, they are entitled to live by it. They are not by any\r\nmeans overpaid, but their salaries in the aggregate amount to a large\r\nannual sum. Before the creation of the Department of Agriculture and\r\nTechnical Instruction in 1900 large sums were spent by the I.A.O.S. not\r\nonly in its proper work of organisation, but also in giving technical\r\ninstruction, which was found to be essential to commercial success. When\r\nthe Society was relieved of this educational work many of its supporters\r\nwithdrew their subscriptions under the impression that there was now no\r\nlonger any need for its continued existence. But so far from the\r\nSociety's usefulness having ceased, it has now become more important\r\nthan ever that the doctrine of organised self-help, which must be the\r\nfoundation of any sound Irish economic policy, should be insisted upon\r\nand put into practical operation as widely as possible. All those who\r\nare devoting their lives to the firm establishment of this self-help\r\nmovement among the chief wealth-producers of the country are agreed that\r\nno better educational work can be done at the moment than that which is\r\nbringing about so salutary a change in the economic attitude of the\r\nIrish mind.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at that the greater part of the necessary funds\r\nshould have been drawn from a very limited circle of public-spirited men\r\ncapable of grasping the significance of a movement the practical effect\r\nof which would appear to be permanent only to those who had a deep\r\ninsight into Irish problems.[41] The difficulty of a successful appeal\r\nto a wider public has been the impossibility of giving in brief form an\r\nadequate explanation, such as that which it is hoped these pages will\r\nafford, of the part the movement was to play in Irish life. We were\r\nasked whether our scheme was business or philanthropy. If philanthropy,\r\nit would probably do more harm than good. If business, why was it not\r\nself-supporting? I remember hearing the movement ridiculed in the House\r\nof Commons by a prominent Irish member on the ground that the accounts\r\nof the I.A.O.S. showed that £20,000 (£40,000 would be nearer the mark\r\nnow) had been put into the 'business,' and that this large capital had\r\nbeen entirely lost! When we proved that agricultural co-operation\r\nbrought a large profit to the members of the societies we formed, it was\r\nsuggested that a small part of this profit would give us all we required\r\nfor our organising work. So it will in time, but if instead of merely\r\nrefusing financial assistance to our converts, we were, on the other\r\nhand, to demand it from them, we certainly should not lessen the\r\ndifficulty of launching our movement among the farmers of Ireland. Some\r\nof our critics denounced the expenditure of so much money for which, in\r\ntheir opinion, there was nothing to show, and said that the time had\r\ncome to stop this 'spoon-feeding.' When those for whose exclusive\r\nbenefit the costly work had been undertaken learned that all we had to\r\noffer was the cold advice that they should help themselves, they not\r\ninfrequently raised a wholly different objection to our economic\r\ndoctrine. Spoonfeeding they might have tolerated, but there was nothing\r\nin the spoon! The movement has survived all these criticisms. The lack\r\nof moral and of financial support which retarded its progress in the\r\nearly years, has been so far surmounted The movement may now, I think,\r\nappeal for further help as one that has justified its existence. The\r\nopinion that it has done so is not held only by those who are engaged in\r\npromoting it, nor by Irish observers alone. The efforts of the Irish\r\nfarmers so to reorganise their industry that they may hopefully approach\r\nthe solution of the problems of rural life are being watched by\r\neconomists and administrators abroad. Enquirers have come to Ireland\r\nduring the last two years from Germany, France, Canada, the United\r\nStates, India, South Africa, Cyprus and the West Indies, having been\r\ndrawn here by the desire to understand the combination of economic and\r\nhuman reform. It was not alone the economic advantages of the movement\r\nwhich interested them, but the way in which the organisation at the same\r\ntime acted upon the character and awoke those forces of self-help and\r\ncomradeship in which lies the surety of any enduring national\r\nprosperity. A native governor from a famine district in the Madras\r\nPresidency, who, perhaps, better than any one realised the importance\r\nof these human factors, because the lethargy of his own people had\r\nforced it on his notice, said, when he was referred to the Department of\r\nAgriculture and Technical Instruction for information, \"Oh, don't speak\r\nto me about Government Departments. They are the same all over the\r\nworld. I come here to learn what the Irish people are doing to help\r\nthemselves and how you awaken the will and the initiative.\" I hope to\r\nshow later that State assistance properly applied is not necessarily\r\ndemoralising but very much the reverse. It is consoling, too, to our\r\nnational pride, long wounded by contemptuous references to our\r\nindustrial incapacity as compared with our neighbours, to find that our\r\nlatest efforts are regarded by them as worthy of imitation. From the\r\nother side of the Channel no less than five County Councils have sent\r\ndeputations of farmers to Ireland to study the progress of the movement,\r\nand already an English Organisation Society, expressly modelled upon its\r\nIrish namesake, has been established and is endeavouring to carry out\r\nthe same work.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that the facts which I have cited should be\r\ninteresting to the honest inquirer. A summary of actual achievement will\r\nshow that this movement has spread all over Ireland, that its principle\r\nof organised self-help has been universally accepted, and that nothing\r\nbut time and the necessary funds are required by its promoters to give\r\nit, within the range of its applicability, general effect. It is no\r\nexaggeration to say that there has been set in motion and carried\r\nbeyond the experimental stage a revolution in agricultural methods which\r\nwill enable our farmers to compete with their rivals abroad, both in\r\nproduction and in distribution, under far more favourable conditions\r\nthan before. Alike in its material and in its moral achievements this\r\nmovement has provided an effective means whereby the peasant proprietary\r\nabout to be created will be able to face and solve the vital problems\r\nbefore it, problems for which no improvement in land tenure, no rent\r\nreductions actual or prospective, could otherwise provide an adequate\r\nsolution. Furthermore, nothing could be more evident to any close\r\nobserver of Irish life than the fact that had it not been for the new\r\nspirit which the workers in this movement, mostly humble unknown men,\r\nhad generated, the attitude of the Irish democracy towards England's\r\nlatest concession to Ireland would have been very different from what it\r\nis. In the last dozen years hundreds and thousands of meetings have been\r\nheld to discuss matters of business importance to our rural communities.\r\nAt these meetings landlord and tenant-farmer have often met each other\r\nfor the first time on a footing of friendly equality, as fellow-members\r\nof co-operative societies. It is significant that all through the\r\nnegotiations which culminated in the Dunraven Treaty, landlords who had\r\ncome into the life of the people in connection with the co-operative\r\nmovement took a prominent part in favour of conciliation.\r\n\r\nI would further give it as my opinion, whatever it may be worth, that\r\nthe movement has exercised a profound influence in those departments of\r\nour national life where, as I have shown in previous chapters, new\r\nforces must be not only recognised but accepted as essential to national\r\nwell-being, if we are to cherish what is good and free ourselves from\r\nwhat is bad in the historical evolution of our national life. In the\r\ndomain of politics it is hard to estimate even the political value of\r\nthe exclusion of politics from deliberations and activities where they\r\nhave no proper place. In our religious life, where intolerance has\r\nperpetuated anti-industrial tendencies, the new movement is seen to be\r\nbringing together for business purposes men who had previously no\r\ndealings with each other, but who have now learned that the doctrine of\r\nself-help by mutual help involves no danger to faith and no sacrifice of\r\nhope, while it engenders a genuinely Christian interpretation of\r\ncharity.[42]\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude the story of this movement without paying a brief\r\ntribute of respect and gratitude to those true patriots who have borne\r\nthe daily burden of the work. I hope the picture I have given of their\r\naims and achievements will lead to a just appreciation of their services\r\nto their country. By these men and women applause or even recognition\r\nwas not expected or desired: they knew that it was to those who had the\r\nadvantages of leisure, and what the world calls position, that the\r\ncredit for their work would be given. But it is of national importance\r\nthat altruistic service should be understood and given freedom of\r\nexpansion. I have, therefore, presented as faithfully as I could the\r\norigin and development of one of the least understood, but in my\r\nopinion, most fruitful movements which has ever been undertaken by a\r\nbody of social and economic reformers. As Irish leaders they have\r\npreferred to remain obscure, conscious that the most damaging criticism\r\nwhich could be applied to their work would be that it depended on their\r\nown personal qualities or acts for its permanent utility. But most\r\nassuredly the real conquerors of the world are those who found upon\r\nhuman character their hopes of human progress.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[37] The story of the conversion of some of the tenants on the Vandeleur\r\nestate into a co-operative community in 1831 by Mr. E.T. Craig, a\r\nScotchman who took up the agency of the property, told in the _History\r\nof Ralahine_ (London, Trübner & Co., 1893) is worth reading. The\r\nexperiment, most hopeful as far as it went, was only two years in\r\nexistence when the landlord gambled away his property at cards in a\r\nDublin club and the Utopia was sold up. But in the co-operative world\r\nMr. Craig, who died as recently as 1894, is revered as the author of the\r\nmost advanced experiment in the realisation of co-operative ideals. The\r\neconomic significance of the narrative is obviously not important, and I\r\ndoubt whether joint ownership of land, except for the purpose of common\r\ngrazing, is a practical ideal. The ready response, however, of the Irish\r\npeasants to Mr. Craig's enthusiasm and the way in which they took up the\r\nidea form an interesting study of the Irish character.\r\n\r\n[38] The late Canon Bagot had done good service in explaining the value\r\nof the new machinery; but unhappily the vital importance of co-operative\r\norganisation was not then understood. He formed some joint stock\r\ncompanies with the result that, having no co-operative spirit to offset\r\ntheir commercial inexperience, they all proved, instead of co-operative\r\nsuccesses, competitive failures. This fact added to our early\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n[39] It should be noted that this form of association for credit\r\npurposes, owing to its peculiar constitution, applies only to a grade of\r\nthe community whose members all live on about the same scale and that a\r\nfairly low one. It is obvious that unlimited liability would lose its\r\nefficacy in developing the sense of responsibility if some members of\r\nthe association were so substantial that its creditors would make them\r\nprimarily responsible in the event of failure. The fact, however, that\r\nthe scheme has worked with unvarying success among the poorest of the\r\npoor, and the most Irish of the Irish, renders it as good an\r\nillustration as can be found of what may be done by sympathetic and\r\nintelligent treatment of Irish economic problems. Mr. Henry W. Wolff,\r\nthe foremost authority on People's Banks in these islands, and Mr. R.A.\r\nYerburgh, M.P., a generous subscriber to the Irish Agricultural\r\nOrganisation Society, have taken great interest in this part of the\r\nmovement and have rendered much assistance.\r\n\r\n[40] Those who wish to go more fully into the details of the\r\nco-operative agricultural movement in Ireland should write to the\r\nSecretary Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, 22 Lincoln-place,\r\nDublin. The publications of the Society are somewhat voluminous, and the\r\ninquirer should intimate any particular branches of the subject in which\r\nhe is especially interested. Those wishing to keep _au courant_ with the\r\nfurther development of the movement would do well to take in the _Irish\r\nHomestead_, post free _6s. 6d._ per annum.\r\n\r\n[41] The chief donors belong to the class of philanthropists who do not\r\ncare to advertise their beneficence. I, therefore, respect their wishes\r\nand withhold their names.\r\n\r\n[42] I recall an occasion when the Vice-President of the I.A.O.S. (a\r\nNationalist in politics and a Jesuit priest), who has been ever ready to\r\nlend a hand as volunteer organiser when the prior claims of his\r\nreligious and educational duties allowed, found himself before an\r\naudience which he was informed, when he came to the meeting, consisted\r\nmainly of Orangemen. He began his address by referring to the new and\r\nsomewhat strange environment into which he had drifted. He did not,\r\nhowever, see why this circumstance should lead to any misunderstanding\r\nbetween himself and his audience. He had never been able to understand\r\nwhat a battle fought upon a famous Irish river two centuries ago had got\r\nto do with the practical issues of to-day which he had come to discuss.\r\nThe dispute in question was, after all, between a Scotchman and a\r\nDutchman, and if it had not yet been decided, they might be left to\r\nsettle it themselves--that is if too great a gulf did not separate them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE RECESS COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new movement, six years after its initiation, had succeeded beyond\r\nthe most sanguine expectations of its promoters. All over the country\r\nthe idea of self-help was taking firm hold of the imagination of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nCo-operation had got, so to speak, into the air to such an extent that,\r\nwhereas at the beginning, as I well remember, our chief difficulty had\r\nbeen to popularise a principle to which one section of the community was\r\nstrongly opposed, and in which no section believed, it was now no longer\r\nnecessary to explain or support the theory, but only to show how it\r\ncould be advantageously applied to some branch of the farmer's industry.\r\nIt was not, strange to say, the economic advantage which had chiefly\r\nappealed to the quick intelligence of the Irish farmer, but rather the\r\nnovel sensation that he was thinking for himself, and that while\r\nimproving his own condition he was working for others. This attitude was\r\nessential to the success of the movement, because had it not been for a\r\nvein of altruism, the \"strong\" farmers would have held aloof, and the\r\nsmall men would have been discouraged by the abstention of the\r\nbetter-off and presumably more enlightened of their class.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, too, we owed something to the recognition on the part of the\r\nworking farmers of Ireland that they were showing a capacity to grasp an\r\nidea which had so far failed to penetrate the bucolic intelligence of\r\nthe predominant partner. Whatever the causes to which the success of the\r\nmovement was attributable, those who were responsible for its promotion\r\nfelt in the year 1895 that it had reached a stage in its development\r\nwhen it was but a question of time to complete the projected revolution\r\nin the farming industry, the substitution of combined for isolated\r\nmethods of production and distribution. It was then further brought home\r\nto them that the principle of self-help was destined to obtain general\r\nacceptance in rural Ireland, and that the time had come when a sound\r\nsystem of State aid to agriculture might be fruitfully grafted on to\r\nthis native growth of local effort and self-reliance.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time our public men had included in the list of Irish\r\ngrievances the fact that England enjoyed a Board of Agriculture while\r\nIreland had no similar institution. As a matter of fact a mere replica\r\nof the English Board would not have fulfilled a tithe of the objects we\r\nhad in view. That much at least we knew, but beyond that our information\r\nwas vague. What, having regard to Irish rural conditions, should be the\r\ncharacter and constitution of any Department called into being to\r\nadminister the aid required? Here indeed was a vital and difficult\r\nproblem. Even those of us who had given the closest thought to the\r\nmatter did not know exactly what was wanted; nor, if we had known our\r\nown minds, could we have formulated our demand in such a way as to have\r\nobtained a backing from representative public bodies, associations, and\r\nindividuals sufficient to secure its concession. Instead, therefore, of\r\nagitating in the conventional manner we determined to try to direct the\r\nbest thought of the country to the problem in hand, with a view to\r\nsatisfying the Government, and also ourselves, as to what was wanted. We\r\nhad confidence that a demand presented to Parliament, based upon calm\r\nand deliberate debate among the most competent of Irishmen, would be\r\nconceded. The story of this agitation, its initiation, its conduct, and\r\nits final success will, I am sure, be of interest to all who feel any\r\nconcern for the welfare of Ireland.\r\n\r\nI have accepted the common characterisation of the Irish as a\r\nleader-following people. When we come to analyse the human material out\r\nof which a strong national life may be constructed, we find that there\r\nare in Ireland--in this connection I exclude the influence of the\r\nclergy, with which I have dealt specifically in another chapter--two\r\nelements of leadership, the political and the industrial. The political\r\nleaders are seen to enjoy an influence over the great majority of the\r\npeople which is probably as powerful as that of any political leaders in\r\nancient or modern times; but as a class they certainly do not take a\r\nprominent, or even an active part in business life. This fact is not\r\nintroduced with any controversial purpose, and I freely acknowledge can\r\nbe interpreted in a sense altogether creditable to the Nationalist\r\nmembers. The other element of leadership contains all that is prominent\r\nin industrial and commercial life, and few countries could produce\r\nbetter types of such leaders than can be found in the northern capital\r\nof the country. But, unhappily, these men are debarred from all\r\ninfluence upon the thought and action of the great majority of the\r\npeople, who are under the domination of the political leaders. This is\r\none of the strange anomalies of Irish life to which I have already\r\nreferred. Its recognition, and the desire to utilise the knowledge of\r\nbusiness men as well as politicians, took practical effect in the\r\nformation of the Recess Committee.\r\n\r\nThe idea underlying this project was the combination of these two forces\r\nof leadership--the force with political influence and that of proved\r\nindustrial and commercial capacity--in order to concentrate public\r\nopinion, which was believed to be inclining in this direction, on the\r\nmaterial needs of the country. The General Election of 1895 had, by\r\nuniversal admission, postponed, for some years at any rate, any\r\npossibility of Home Rule, and the cessation of the bitter feelings\r\naroused when Home Rule seemed imminent provided the opportunity for an\r\nappeal to the Irish people in behalf of the views which I have\r\nadumbrated. The appeal took the form of a letter, dated August 27th,\r\n1895, by the author to the Irish Press, under the quite sincere, if\r\nsomewhat grandiloquent, title, \"A proposal affecting the general welfare\r\nof Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter set out the general scope and purpose of the scheme. After a\r\nconfession of the writer's continued opposition to Home Rule, the\r\nadmission was made that if the average Irish elector, who is more\r\nintelligent than the average British elector, were also as prosperous,\r\nas industrious, and as well educated, his continued demand, in the\r\nproper constitutional way, for Home Rule would very likely result in the\r\nexperiment being one day tried. On the other hand, the opinion was\r\nexpressed that if the material conditions of the great body of our\r\ncountrymen were advanced, if they were encouraged in industrial\r\nenterprise, and were provided with practical education in proportion to\r\ntheir natural intelligence, they would see that a political development\r\non lines similar to those adopted in England was, considering the\r\nnecessary relations between the two countries, best for Ireland; and\r\nthen they would cease to desire what is ordinarily understood as Home\r\nRule. A basis for united action between politicians on both sides of the\r\nIrish controversy was then suggested. Finding ourselves still opposed\r\nupon the main question, but all anxious to promote the welfare of the\r\ncountry, and confident that, as this was advanced, our respective\r\npolicies would be confirmed, it would appear, it was suggested, to be\r\nalike good patriotism and good policy to work for the material and\r\nsocial advancement of the people. Why then, it was asked, should any\r\nIrishman hesitate to enter at once upon that united action between men\r\nof both parties which alone, under existing conditions, could enable\r\neither party to do any real and lasting good to the country?\r\n\r\nThe letter proceeded to indicate economic legislation which, though\r\nsorely needed by Ireland, was hopelessly unattainable unless it could be\r\nremoved from the region of controversy. The _modus co-operandi_\r\nsuggested was as follows:--a committee sitting in the Parliamentary\r\nrecess, whence it came to be known as the Recess Committee, was to be\r\nformed, consisting in the first instance, of Irish Members of Parliament\r\nnominated by the leaders of the different sections. These nominees were\r\nto invite to join them any Irishmen whose capacity, knowledge, or\r\nexperience might be of service to the Committee, irrespective of the\r\npolitical party or religious persuasion to which they might belong. The\r\nday had come, the letter went on to say, when \"we Unionists, without\r\nabating one jot of our Unionism, and Nationalists, without abating one\r\njot of their Nationalism, can each show our faith in the cause for which\r\nwe have fought so bitterly and so long, by sinking our party differences\r\nfor our country's good, and leaving our respective policies for the\r\njustification of time.\"\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, few were sanguine enough to hope that such a committee\r\nwould ever be brought together. If that were accomplished some\r\nprophesied that its members would but emulate the fame of the Kilkenny\r\ncats. A severe blow was dealt to the project at the outset by the\r\nrefusal of Mr. Justin McCarthy, who then spoke for the largest section\r\nof the Nationalist representatives, to have anything to do with it. His\r\nreply to the letter must be given in full:--\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MR. PLUNKETT,\r\n\r\n     I am sure I need not say that any effort to promote the general\r\n     welfare of Ireland has my fullest sympathy. I readily acknowledge\r\n     and entirely believe in the sincerity and good purpose of your\r\n     effort, but I cannot see my way to associate myself with it. Your\r\n     frank avowal in your letter of August 27th is the expression of a\r\n     belief that if your policy could be successfully carried out the\r\n     Irish people \"would cease to desire Home Rule.\" Now, I do not\r\n     believe that anything in the way of material improvement conferred\r\n     by the Parliament at Westminster, or by Dublin Castle, could\r\n     extinguish the national desire for Home Rule. Still, I do not feel\r\n     that I could possibly take part in any organisation which had for\r\n     its object the seeking of a substitute for that which I believe to\r\n     be Ireland's greatest need--Home Rule.\r\n\r\n     Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n     JUSTIN MCCARTHY.\r\n\r\n     73, Eaton-terrace, S.W., October 22nd, 1895.\r\n\r\nI had not much hope that I could influence Mr. McCarthy's decision; but\r\nit was so serious an obstacle to further action that I made one more\r\nappeal. I wrote to my respected and courteous correspondent, pointing\r\nout the misconception of my proposal, which had arisen from the use made\r\nof the six words quoted by him, which were hardly intelligible without\r\nthe context. I asked him to reconsider his refusal to join in the\r\nproposal for promoting the material improvement of our country, on\r\naccount of a contingency which he confidently declared could not arise.\r\nBut in those days economic seed fell upon stony political ground.\r\n\r\nThe position was rendered still more difficult by the action of Colonel\r\nSaunderson, the leader of the Irish Unionist party, who wrote to the\r\nnewspapers declaring that he would not sit on a Committee with Mr. John\r\nRedmond. On the other hand, Mr. Redmond, speaking then for the\r\n\"Independent\" party, consisting of less than a dozen members, but\r\ncontaining some men who agreed with Mr. Field's admission in the House\r\nof Commons that \"man cannot live on politics alone,\" joined the\r\nCommittee and acted throughout in a manner which was broad,\r\nstatesmanlike, conciliatory, and as generous as it was courageous. His\r\nletter of acceptance ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n     DEAR MR. PLUNKETT,\r\n\r\n     I received your letter, in which you ask me to co-operate with you\r\n     in bringing together a small Committee of Members of Parliament to\r\n     discuss certain measures to be proposed next Session for the\r\n     benefit of Ireland. While I cannot take as sanguine a view as you\r\n     do of the benefits likely to flow from such a proceeding, I am\r\n     unwilling to take the responsibility of declining to aid in any\r\n     effort to promote useful legislation for Ireland.\r\n\r\n     I will, under the circumstances, co-operate with you in bringing\r\n     such a Committee as you suggest together. Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n     J.E. REDMOND.\r\n\r\n     October 21st, 1895.\r\n\r\nBefore these decisions were officially announced the idea had \"caught\r\non.\" Public bodies throughout the country endorsed the scheme. The\r\nparliamentarians, who formed the nucleus of the Committee, came\r\ntogether and invited prominent men from all quarters to join them. A\r\ncommittee which, though informal and self-appointed, might fairly claim\r\nto be representative in every material respect, was thus constituted on\r\nthe lines laid down.\r\n\r\nTruly, it was a strange council over which I had the honour to preside.\r\nAll shades of politics were there--Lords Mayo and Monteagle, Mr. Dane\r\nand Sir Thomas Lea (Tories and Liberal Unionist Peers and Members of\r\nParliament) sitting down beside Mr. John Redmond and his parliamentary\r\nfollowers. It was found possible, in framing proposals fraught with\r\nmoral, social, and educational results, to secure the cordial agreement\r\nof the late Rev. Dr. Kane, Grand Master of the Belfast Orangemen, and of\r\nthe eminent Jesuit educationist, Father Thomas Finlay, of the Royal\r\nUniversity. The O'Conor Don, the able Chairman of the Financial\r\nRelations Commission, and Mr. John Ross, M.P., now one of His Majesty's\r\nJudges, both Unionists, were balanced by the Lord Mayor of Dublin, and\r\nMr. T.C. Harrington, M.P., who now occupies that post, both\r\nNationalists. The late Sir John Arnott fitly represented the commercial\r\nenterprise of the South, while such men as Mr. Thomas Sinclair,\r\nuniversally regarded as one of the wisest of Irish public men, Sir\r\nWilliam Ewart, head of the leading linen concern in the North, Sir\r\nDaniel Dixon, now Lord Mayor of Belfast, Sir James Musgrave, Chairman of\r\nthe Belfast Harbour Board, and Mr. Thomas Andrews, a well-known\r\nflax-spinner and Chairman of the Belfast and County Down Railway, would\r\nbe universally accepted as the highest authorities upon the needs of the\r\nbusiness community which has made Ulster famous in the industrial world.\r\nMr. T.P. Gill, besides undertaking investigation of the utmost value\r\ninto State aid to agriculture in France and Denmark, acted as Hon.\r\nSecretary to the Committee, of which he was a member.\r\n\r\nThe story of our deliberations and ultimate conclusions cannot be set\r\nforth here except in the barest outline. We instituted an inquiry into\r\nthe means by which the Government could best promote the development of\r\nour agricultural and industrial resources, and despatched commissioners\r\nto countries of Europe whose conditions and progress might afford some\r\nlessons for Ireland. Most of this work was done for us by the late\r\neminent statistician, Mr. Michael Mulhall. Our funds did not admit of an\r\ninquiry in the United States or the Colonies. However, we obtained\r\ninvaluable information as to the methods by which countries which were\r\nour chief rivals in agricultural and industrial production have been\r\nenabled to compete successfully with our producers even in our own\r\nmarkets. Our commissioners were instructed in each case to collect the\r\nfacts necessary to enable us to differentiate between the parts played\r\nrespectively by State aid and the efforts of the people themselves in\r\nproducing these results. With this information before us, after long and\r\nearnest deliberation we came to a unanimous agreement upon the main\r\nfacts of the situation with which we had to deal, and upon the\r\nrecommendations for remedial legislation which we should make to the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe substance of our recommendations was that a Department of Government\r\nshould be specially created, with a minister directly responsible to\r\nParliament at its head. The central body was to be assisted by a\r\nConsultative Council representative of the interests concerned. The\r\nDepartment was to be adequately endowed from the Imperial Treasury, and\r\nwas to administer State aid to agriculture and industries in Ireland\r\nupon principles which were fully described. The proposal to amalgamate\r\nagriculture and industries under one Department was adopted largely on\r\naccount of the opinion expressed by M. Tisserand, late Director-General\r\nof Agriculture in France, one of the highest authorities in Europe upon\r\nthe administration of State aid to agriculture.[43] The creation of a\r\nnew minister directly responsible to Parliament was considered a\r\nnecessary provision. Ireland is governed by a number of Boards, all,\r\nwith the exception of the Board of Works (which is really a branch of\r\nthe Treasury), responsible to the Chief Secretary--practically a whole\r\ncabinet under one hat--who is supposed to be responsible for them to\r\nParliament and to the Lord Lieutenant. The bearers of this burden are\r\ngenerally men of great ability. But no Chief Secretary could possibly\r\ntake under his wing yet another department with the entirely new and\r\nimportant functions now to be discharged. What these functions were to\r\nbe need not here be described, as the Department thus 'agitated' for has\r\nnow been three years at work and will form the subject of the next two\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\nOn August 1st, 1896, less than a year from the issue of the invitation\r\nto the political leaders, the Report was forwarded to the Chief\r\nSecretary to the Lord Lieutenant for Ireland, with a covering letter,\r\nsetting out the considerations upon which the Committee relied for the\r\njustification of its course of action. Attention was drawn to the terms\r\nof the original proposal, its exceptional nature and essential\r\ninformality, the political conditions which appeared to make it\r\nopportune, the spirit in which it was responded to by those who were\r\ninvited to join, and the degree of public approval which had been\r\naccorded to our action. We were able to claim for the Committee that it\r\nwas thoroughly representative of those agricultural and industrial\r\ninterests, North and South, with which the Report was concerned.\r\n\r\nThere were two special features in the brief history of this unique\r\ncoming together of Irishmen which will strike any man familiar with the\r\nconditions of Irish public life. The first was the way in which the\r\nbusiness element, consisting of men already deeply engaged in their\r\nvarious callings--and, indeed, selected for that very reason--devoted\r\ntime and labour to the service of their country. Still more significant\r\nwas the fact that the political element on the Committee should have\r\ncome to an absolutely unanimous agreement upon a policy which, though\r\nnot intended to influence the trend of politics, was yet bound to have\r\nfar-reaching consequences upon the political thought of the country, and\r\nupon the positions of parties and leaders. It was thought only fair to\r\nthe Nationalist members of the Committee that every precaution should be\r\ntaken to prevent their being placed in a false position. 'To avoid any\r\npossible misconception,' the covering letter ran, 'as to the attitude of\r\nthose members of the Committee who are not supporters of the present\r\nGovernment, it is right here to state that, while under existing\r\npolitical conditions they agreed in recommending a certain course to the\r\nGovernment, they wish it to be understood that their political\r\nprinciples remain unaltered, and that, were it immediately possible,\r\nthey would prefer that the suggested reforms should be preceded by the\r\nconstitutional changes of which they are the well-known advocates.'\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the Committee claimed favourable\r\nconsideration for their proposals on the ground that they sought to act\r\nas 'a channel of communication between the Irish Government and Irish\r\npublic opinion.' Little interest, they pointed out, had been hitherto\r\naroused in those economic problems for which the Report suggested some\r\nsolution. They expressed the hope that their action would do something\r\nto remedy this defect, especially in view of the importance which\r\nforeign Governments had found it necessary to attach to public opinion\r\nin working out their various systems of State aid to agriculture and\r\nindustries. At the same time the Committee emphasised, in the covering\r\nletter, their reliance on individual and combined effort rather than on\r\nState aid. They were able to point out that, in asking for the latter,\r\nthey had throughout attached the utmost importance to its being granted\r\nin such a manner as to evoke and supplement, and in no way be a\r\nsubstitute for self-help. If they appeared to give undue prominence to\r\nthe capabilities of State initiation, it was to be remembered that they\r\nwere dealing with economic conditions which had been artificially\r\nproduced, and which, therefore, might require exceptional treatment of a\r\ntemporary nature to bring about a permanent remedy.\r\n\r\nI fear those most intimately connected with the above occurrences will\r\nregard this chapter as a very inadequate description of events so\r\nunprecedented and so full of hope for the future. My purpose is,\r\nhowever, to limit myself, in dealing with the past, to such details as\r\nare necessary to enable the reader to understand the present facts of\r\nIrish life, and to build upon them his own conclusions as to the most\r\nhopeful line of future development. I shall, therefore, pass rapidly in\r\nreview the events which led to the fruition of the labours of the Recess\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion in favour of the new proposals grew rapidly. Before the\r\nend of the year (1896) a deputation, representing all the leading\r\nagricultural and industrial interests of the country, waited upon the\r\nIrish Government, in order to press upon them the urgent need for the\r\nnew department. The Lord Lieutenant, after describing the gathering as\r\n'one of the most notable deputations which had ever come to lay its case\r\nbefore the Irish Government,' and noting the 'remarkable growth of\r\npublic opinion' in favour of the policy they were advocating, expressed\r\nhis heartfelt sympathy with the case which had been presented, and his\r\nearnest desire--which was well known--to proceed with legislation for\r\nthe agricultural and industrial development of the country at the\r\nearliest moment. The demand made upon the Government was,\r\nargumentatively, already irresistible. But economic agitation of this\r\nkind takes time to acquire dynamic force. Mr. Gerald Balfour introduced\r\na Bill the following year, but it had to be withdrawn to leave the way\r\nclear for the other great Irish measure which revolutionised local\r\ngovernment. The unconventional agitation went on upon the original\r\nlines, appealing to that latent public opinion which we were striving to\r\ndevelop. In 1899 another Bill was introduced, and, owing to its masterly\r\nhandling by the Chief Secretary in the House of Commons, ably seconded\r\nby the strong support given by Lord Cadogan, who was in the Cabinet, it\r\nbecame law.\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude this chapter without a word upon the extraordinary\r\nmisunderstanding of Mr. Gerald Balfour's policy to which the obscuring\r\natmosphere surrounding all Irish questions gave rise. In one respect\r\nthat policy was a new departure of the utmost importance. He proved\r\nhimself ready to take a measure from Ireland and carry it through,\r\ninstead of insisting upon a purely English scheme which he could call\r\nhis own. These pre-digested foods had already done much to destroy our\r\npolitical digestion, and it was time we were given something to grow, to\r\ncook, and to assimilate for ourselves. It will be seen, too, in the next\r\nchapter, that he had realised the potentiality for good of the new\r\nforces in Irish life to which he gave play in his two great linked\r\nActs--one of them popularising local government, and the other creating\r\na new Department which was to bring the government and the people\r\ntogether in an attempt to develop the resources of the country. Yet his\r\neminently sane and far-seeing policy was regarded in many quarters as a\r\nsacrifice of Unionist interests in Ireland. Its real effect was to endow\r\nUnionism with a positive as well as a negative policy. But all reformers\r\nknow that the further ahead they look, the longer they have to wait for\r\ntheir justification. Meanwhile, we may leave out of consideration the\r\ndivision of honour or of blame for what has been done. The only matter\r\nof historic interest is to arrive at a correct measure of the progress\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe new movement had thus completed the first and second stages of its\r\nmission. The idea of self-help had become a growing reality, and upon\r\nthis foundation an edifice of State aid had been erected. When a\r\nNationalist member met a Tory member of the Recess Committee he laughed\r\nover the success with which they had wheedled a measure of industrial\r\nHome Rule out of a Unionist Government. None the less they cordially\r\nagreed that the people would rise to their economic responsibility. The\r\npromoters of the movement had faith that this new departure in English\r\ngovernment would be more than justified by the English test, and that in\r\nthe new sphere of administration the government would be accorded,\r\nwithout prejudice, of course, to the ultimate views either of Unionists\r\nor Home Rulers, not only the consent, but the whole-hearted co-operation\r\nof the governed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[43] The memorandum which he kindly contributed to the Recess Committee\r\nwas copied into the Annual Report of the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture for 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nA NEW DEPARTURE IN IRISH ADMINISTRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the average English Member of Parliament, the passing of an Act \"for\r\nestablishing a Department of Agriculture and other Industries and\r\nTechnical Instruction in Ireland and for other purposes connected\r\ntherewith,\" probably signified little more than the removal of another\r\nIrish grievance, which might not be imaginary, by the concession to\r\nIreland of an equivalent to the Board of Agriculture in England. In\r\nreality the difference between the two institutions is as wide as the\r\ndifference between the two islands. The chief interest of the new\r\nDepartment consists in the free play which it gives to the pent-up\r\nforces of a re-awakening life. A new institution is at best but a new\r\nopportunity, but the Department starts with the unique advantage that,\r\nunlike most Irish institutions, it is one which we Irishmen planned\r\nourselves and for which we have worked. For this reason the opportunity\r\nis one to which we may hope to rise.\r\n\r\nBefore I can convey any clear impression of the part which the\r\nDepartment is, I believe, destined to play on the stage of Irish public\r\nlife, it will be necessary for me to give a somewhat detailed\r\ndescription of its functions and constitution. The subject is perhaps\r\ndull and technical; but readers cannot understand the Ireland of to-day\r\nunless they have in their minds not only an accurate conception of the\r\nnew moral forces in Irish life and of the movements to which these\r\nforces have given rise, but also a knowledge of the administrative\r\nmachinery and methods by which the people and the Government are now,\r\nfor the first time since the Union, working together towards the\r\nbuilding up of the Ireland of to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThe Department consists of the President (who is the Chief Secretary for\r\nthe time being) and the Vice-President. The staff is composed of a\r\nSecretary, two Assistant Secretaries (one in respect of Agriculture and\r\none in respect of Technical Instruction), as well as certain heads of\r\nBranches and a number of inspectors, instructors, officers and servants.\r\nThe Recess Committee, it will be remembered, had laid stress upon the\r\nimportance of having at the head of the Department a new Minister who\r\nshould be directly responsible to Parliament; and, accordingly, it was\r\narranged that the Vice-President should be its direct Ministerial head.\r\nThe Act provided that the Department should be assisted in its work by a\r\nCouncil of Agriculture and two Boards, and also by a Consultative\r\nCommittee to advise upon educational questions. But before discussing\r\nthe constitution of these bodies, it is necessary to explain the nature\r\nof the task assigned to the new Department which began work in April,\r\n1900. It was created to fulfil two main purposes. In the first place,\r\nit was to consolidate in one authority certain inter-related functions\r\nof government in connection with the business concerns of the people\r\nwhich, until the creation of the Department, were scattered over some\r\nhalf-dozen Boards, and to place these functions under the direct control\r\nand responsibility of the new Minister. The second purpose was to\r\nprovide means by which the Government and the people might work together\r\nin developing the resources of the country so far as State intervention\r\ncould be legitimately applied to this end.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish the first object, two distinct Government departments, the\r\nVeterinary Department of the Privy Council and the Office of the\r\nInspectors of Irish Fisheries, were merged in the new Department. The\r\nimportance to the economic life of the country of having the laws for\r\nsafeguarding our flocks and herds from disease, our crops from insect\r\npests, our farmers from fraud in the supply of fertilisers and feeding\r\nstuffs and in the adulteration of foods (which compete with their\r\nproducts), administered by a Department generally concerned for the\r\nfarming industry need not be laboured. Similarly, it was well that the\r\nlaws for the protection of both sea and inland fisheries should be\r\nadministered by the authority whose function it was to develop these\r\nindustries. There was also transferred from South Kensington the\r\nadministration of the Science and Arts grants and the grant in aid of\r\ntechnical instruction, together with the control of several national\r\ninstitutions, the most important being the Royal College of Science and\r\nthe Metropolitan School of Art; for they, in a sense, would stand at the\r\nhead of much of the new work which would be required for the\r\ncontemplated agricultural and industrial developments. The Albert\r\nInstitute at Glasnevin and the Munster Institute in Cork, both\r\ninstitutions for teaching practical agriculture, were, as a matter of\r\ncourse, handed over from the Board of National Education.\r\n\r\nThe desirability of bringing order and simplicity into these branches of\r\nadministration, where co-related action was not provided for before, was\r\nobvious. A few years ago, to take a somewhat extreme case, when a\r\nvirulent attack of potato disease broke out which demanded prompt and\r\nactive Governmental intervention, the task of instructing farmers how to\r\nspray their potatoes was shared by no fewer than six official or\r\nsemi-official bodies. The consolidation of administration effected by\r\nthe Act, in addition to being a real step towards efficiency and\r\neconomy, relieved the Chief Secretary of an immense amount of detailed\r\nwork to which he could not possibly give adequate personal attention,\r\nand made it possible for him to devote a greater share of his time to\r\nthe larger problems of general Irish legislation and finance.\r\n\r\nThe newly created powers of the Department, which were added to and\r\nco-ordinated with the various pre-existing functions of the several\r\ndepartments whose consolidation I have mentioned above, fairly fulfilled\r\nthe recommendation of the Recess Committee that the Department should\r\nhave 'a wide reference and a free hand.' These powers include the\r\naiding, improving, and developing of agriculture in all its branches;\r\nhorticulture, forestry, home and cottage industries; sea and inland\r\nfisheries; the aiding and facilitating of the transit of produce; and\r\nthe organisation of a system of education in science and art, and in\r\ntechnology as applied to these various subjects. The provision of\r\ntechnical instruction suitable to the needs of the few manufacturing\r\ncentres in Ireland was included, but need not be dealt with in any\r\ndetail in these pages, since, as I have said before, the questions\r\nconnected therewith are more or less common to all such centres and have\r\nno specially Irish significance.\r\n\r\nFor all the administrative functions transferred to the new Department\r\nmoneys are, as before, annually voted by Parliament. Towards the\r\nfulfilment of the second purpose mentioned above--the development of the\r\nresources of the country upon the principles of the Recess Committee--an\r\nannual income of £166,000, which was derived in about equal parts from\r\nIrish and imperial sources, and is called the Department's Endowment,\r\ntogether with a capital sum of about £200,000, were provided.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that a very wide sphere of usefulness was thus opened\r\nout for the new Department in two distinct ways. The consolidation,\r\nunder one authority, of many scattered but co-related functions was\r\nclearly a move in the right direction. Upon this part of its\r\nrecommendations the Recess Committee had no difficulty in coming to a\r\nquick decision. But the real importance of their Report lay in the\r\ndirection of the new work which was to be assigned to the Department.\r\nUnder the new order of things, if the Department, acting with as well as\r\nfor the people, succeeds in doing well what legitimately may and ought\r\nto be done by the Government towards the development of the resources of\r\nthe country, and, at the same time, as far as possible confines its\r\ninterference to helping the Irish people to help themselves, a wholly\r\nnew spirit will be imported into the industrial life of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe very nature of the work which the Department was called into\r\nexistence to accomplish made it absolutely essential that it should keep\r\nin touch with the classes whom its work would most immediately affect,\r\nand without whose active co-operation no lasting good could be achieved.\r\nThe machinery for this purpose was provided by the establishment of a\r\nCouncil of Agriculture and two Boards, one of the latter being concerned\r\nwith agriculture, rural industries, and inland fisheries, the other with\r\ntechnical instruction. These representative bodies, whose constitution\r\nis interesting as a new departure in administration, were adapted from\r\nsimilar continental councils which have been found by experience, in\r\nthose foreign countries which are Ireland's economic rivals, to be the\r\nmost valuable of all means whereby the administration keeps in touch\r\nwith the agricultural and industrial classes, and becomes truly\r\nresponsive to their needs and wishes.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Agriculture consists of two members appointed by each\r\nCounty Council (Cork being regarded as two counties and returning four\r\nmembers), making in all sixty-eight persons. The Department also appoint\r\none half this number of persons, observing in their nomination the same\r\nprovincial proportions as obtained in the appointments by the popular\r\nbodies. This adds thirty-four members, and makes in all one hundred and\r\ntwo Councillors, in addition to the President and Vice-President of the\r\nDepartment, who are _ex-officio_ members. Thus, if all the members\r\nattended a Council meeting, the Vice-President would find himself\r\npresiding over a body as truly representative of the interests concerned\r\nas could be brought together, consisting, by a strange coincidence, of\r\nexactly the same number as the Irish representatives in Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Council, which is appointed for a term of three years, the first\r\nterm dating from the 1st April, 1900, has a two-fold function. It is, in\r\nthe first place, a deliberative assembly which must be convened by the\r\nDepartment at least once a year. The domain over which its deliberations\r\nmay travel is certainly not restricted, as the Act defines its function\r\nas that of \"discussing matters of public interest in connection with any\r\nof the purposes of this Act.\" The view Mr. Gerald Balfour took was that\r\nnothing but the new spirit he laboured to evoke would make his machine\r\nwork. Although he gave the Vice-President statutory powers to make\r\nrules for the proper ordering of the Council debates, I have been well\r\ncontent to rely upon the usual privileges of a chairman. I have\r\nestimated beforehand the time required for the discussion of matters of\r\ninquiry: the speakers have condensed their speeches accordingly, the\r\nbusiness has been expeditiously transacted, and in the mere exchange of\r\nideas invaluable assistance has been given to the Department.\r\n\r\nThe second function of the Council is exercised only at its first\r\nmeeting, and consequently but once in three years. At this first\r\ntriennial meeting it becomes an Electoral College. It divides itself\r\ninto four Provincial Committees, each of which elects two members to\r\nrepresent its province on the Agricultural Board and one member to\r\nrepresent it on the Board of Technical Instruction. The Agricultural\r\nBoard, which controls a sum of over £100,000 a year, consists of twelve\r\nmembers, and as eight out of the twelve are elected by the four\r\nProvincial Committees--the remaining four being appointed by the\r\nDepartment, one from each province--it will be seen that the Council of\r\nAgriculture exercises an influence upon the administration commensurate\r\nwith its own representative character. The Board of Technical\r\nInstruction, consisting of twenty-one members, together with the\r\nPresident and Vice-President of the Department, has a less simple\r\nconstitution, owing to the fact that it is concerned with the more\r\ncomplex life of the urban districts of the country. As I have said, the\r\nCouncil of Agriculture elects only four members--one for each province.\r\nThe Department appoints four others; each of the County Boroughs of\r\nDublin and Belfast appoints three members; the remaining four County\r\nBoroughs appoint one member each; a joint Committee of the Councils of\r\nthe large urban districts surrounding Dublin appoint one member; one\r\nmember is appointed by the Commissioners of National Education, and one\r\nmember by the Intermediate Board of Education.\r\n\r\nThe two Boards have to advise upon all matters submitted to them by the\r\nDepartment in connection, in the one case, with agriculture and other\r\nrural industries and inland fisheries, and, in the other case, in\r\nconnection with Technical Instruction. The advisory powers of the Boards\r\nare very real, for the expenditure of all moneys out of the Endowment\r\nfunds is subject to their concurrence. Hence, while they have not\r\nspecific administrative powers and apparently have only the right of\r\nveto, it is obvious that, if they wished, they might largely force their\r\nown views upon the Department by refusing to sanction the expenditure of\r\nmoney upon any of the Department's proposals, until these were so\r\nmodified as practically to be their own proposals. It is, therefore,\r\nclear that the machinery can only work harmoniously and efficiently so\r\nlong as it is moved by a right spirit. Above all it is necessary that\r\nthe central administrative body should gain such a measure of popular\r\nconfidence as to enable it, without loss of influence, to resist\r\nproposals for expenditure upon schemes which might ensure great\r\npopularity at the moment, but would do permanent harm to the industrial\r\ncharacter we are all trying to build up. I need not fear contradiction\r\nat the hands of a single member of either Board when I say that up to\r\nthe present perfect harmony has reigned throughout. The utmost\r\nconsideration has been shown by the Boards for the difficulties which\r\nthe Department have to overcome; and I think I may add that due regard\r\nhas been paid by the administrative authority to the representative\r\ncharacter and the legitimate wishes of the bodies which advise and\r\nlargely control it.\r\n\r\nThe other statutory body attached to the Department has a significance\r\nand potential importance in strange contrast to the humble place it\r\noccupies in the statute book. The Agriculture and Technical Instruction\r\n(Ireland) Act, 1899, has, like many other Acts, a part entitled\r\n'Miscellaneous,' in which the draughtsman's skill has attended to\r\nmultifarious practical details, and made provision for all manner of\r\ncontingencies, many of which the layman might never have thought of or\r\nforeseen. Travelling expenses for Council, Boards, and Committees,\r\ncasual vacancies thereon, a short title for the Act, and a seal for the\r\nDepartment, definitions, which show how little we know of our own\r\nlanguage, and a host of kindred matters are included. In this miscellany\r\nappears the following little clause:--\r\n\r\n     For the purpose of co-ordinating educational administration there\r\n     shall be established a Consultative Committee consisting of the\r\n     following members:--\r\n\r\n     (a.) The Vice-President of the Department, who shall be chairman\r\n     thereof;\r\n\r\n     (b.) One person to be appointed by the Commissioners of National\r\n     Education;\r\n\r\n     (c.) One person to be appointed by the Intermediate Education\r\n     Board;\r\n\r\n     (d.) One person to be appointed by the Agricultural Board; and\r\n\r\n     (e.) One person to be appointed by the Board of Technical\r\n     Instruction.\r\n\r\nNow the real value of this clause, and in this I think it shows a\r\nconsumate statesmanship, lies not in what it says, but in what it\r\nsuggests. The Committee, it will be observed, has an immensely important\r\nfunction, but no power beyond such authority as its representative\r\ncharacter may afford. Any attempt to deal with a large educational\r\nproblem by a clause in a measure of this kind would have alarmed the\r\nwhole force of unco-ordinated pedagogy, and perhaps have wrecked the\r\nBill. The clause as it stands is in harmony with the whole spirit of the\r\nnew movement and of the legislation provided for its advancement. The\r\nCommittee may be very useful in suggesting improvements in educational\r\nadministration which will prevent unnecessary overlapping and lead to\r\nco-operation between the systems concerned. Indeed it has already made\r\nsuggestions of far-reaching importance, which have been acted upon by\r\nthe educational authorities represented upon it. As I have said in an\r\nearlier chapter when discussing Irish education from the practical\r\npoint of view, I have great faith in the efficacy of the economic factor\r\nin educational controversy, and this Committee is certainly in a\r\nposition to watch and pronounce on any defects in our educational system\r\nwhich the new efforts to deal practically with our industrial and\r\ncommercial problems may disclose.\r\n\r\nThere remains to be explained only one feature of the new administrative\r\nmachinery, and it is a very important one. The Recess Committee had\r\nrecommended the adaptation to Ireland of a type of central institution\r\nwhich it had found in successful operation on the Continent wherever it\r\nhad pursued its investigations. So far as schemes applicable to the\r\nwhole country were concerned, the central Department, assuming that it\r\ngained the confidence of the Council and Boards, might easily justify\r\nits existence. But the greater part of its work, the Recess Committee\r\nsaw, would relate to special localities, and could not succeed without\r\nthe cordial co-operation of the people immediately concerned. This fact\r\nbrought Mr. Gerald Balfour face to face with a problem which the Recess\r\nCommittee could not solve in its day, because, when it sat, there still\r\nexisted the old grand jury system, though its early abolition had been\r\npromised. It was extremely fortunate that to the same minister fell the\r\ntask of framing both the Act of 1898, which revolutionised local\r\ngovernment, and the Act of 1899, now under review. The success with\r\nwhich these two Acts were linked together by the provisions of the\r\nlatter forms an interesting lesson in constructive statesmanship. Time\r\nwill, I believe, thoroughly discredit the hostile criticism which\r\nwithheld its due mead of praise from the most fruitful policy which any\r\nadministration had up to that time ever devised for the better\r\ngovernment of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe local authorities created by the Act of 1898 provided the machinery\r\nfor enabling the representatives of the people to decide themselves, to\r\na large extent, upon the nature of the particular measures to be adopted\r\nin each locality and to carry out the schemes when formulated. The Act\r\ncreating the new Department empowered the council of any county or of\r\nany urban district, or any two or more public bodies jointly, to appoint\r\ncommittees, composed partly of members of the local bodies and partly of\r\nco-opted persons, for the purpose of carrying out such of the\r\nDepartment's schemes as are of local, and not of general importance.\r\nTrue to the underlying principle of the new movement--the principle of\r\nself-reliance and local effort--the Act lays it down that 'the\r\nDepartment shall not, in the absence of any special considerations,\r\napply or approve of the application of money ... to schemes in respect\r\nof which aid is not given out of money provided by local authorities or\r\nfrom other local sources.' To meet this requirement the local\r\nauthorities are given the power of raising a limited rate for the\r\npurposes of the Act. By these two simple provisions for local\r\nadministration and local combination, the people of each district were\r\nmade voluntarily contributory both in effort and in money, towards the\r\nnew practical developments, and given an interest in, and\r\nresponsibility for their success. It was of the utmost importance that\r\nthese new local authorities should be practically interested in the\r\nbusiness concerns of the country which the Department was to serve. Mr.\r\nGerald Balfour himself, in introducing the Local Government Bill, had\r\nshown that he was under no illusion as to the possible disappointment to\r\nwhich his great democratic experiment might at first give rise. He\r\nanticipated that it would \"work through failure to success.\" To put it\r\nplainly, the new bodies might devote a great deal of attention to\r\npolitics and very little to business. I am told by those best qualified\r\nto form an opinion (some of my informants having been, to say the least,\r\nsceptical as to the wisdom of the experiment), that notwithstanding some\r\nextravagances in particular instances, it can already be stated\r\npositively that local government in Ireland, taken as a whole, has not\r\nsuffered in efficiency by the revolution which it has undergone. This is\r\nthe opinion of officials of the Local Government Board,[44] and refers\r\nmainly to the transaction of the fiscal business of the new local\r\nauthorities. From a different point of observation I shall presently\r\nbear witness to a display of administrative capacity on the part of the\r\nmany statutory committees, appointed by County, Borough, and District\r\nCouncils to co-operate with the Department, which is most creditable to\r\nthe thought and feeling of the people.\r\n\r\nIt would be quite unfair to a large body of farmers in Ireland if, in\r\ndescribing the administrative machinery for carrying out an economic\r\npolicy based upon self-help and dependent for its success upon the\r\nconciliatory spirit abroad in the country, I were to ignore the part\r\nplayed by the large number of co-operative associations, the\r\norganisation, work and multiplication of which have been described in a\r\nformer chapter. The Recess Committee, in their enquiries, found that, in\r\nthe countries whose competition Ireland feels most keenly, Departments\r\nof Agriculture had come to recognise it as an axiom of their policy that\r\nwithout organisation for economic purposes amongst the agricultural\r\nclasses, State aid to agriculture must be largely ineffectual, and even\r\nmischievous. Such Departments devote a considerable part of their\r\nefforts to promoting agricultural organisation. Short a time as this\r\nDepartment has been in existence it has had some striking evidence of\r\nthe justice of these views. As will be seen from the First Annual Report\r\nof the Department, it was only where the farmers were organised in\r\nproperly representative societies that many of the lessons the\r\nDepartment had to teach could effectually reach the farming classes, or\r\nthat many of the agricultural experiments intended for their guidance\r\ncould be profitably carried out. Although these experiment schemes were\r\nissued to the County Councils and the agricultural public generally, it\r\nwas only the farmers organised in societies who were really in a\r\nposition to take part in them. Some of these experiments, indeed, could\r\nnot be carried out at all except through such societies.\r\n\r\nBoth for the sake of efficiency in its educational work, and of economy\r\nin administration, the Department would be obliged to lay stress on the\r\nvalue of organisation.[45] But there are other reasons for its doing so:\r\nindustrial, moral, and social. In an able critique upon Bodley's\r\n_France_ Madame Darmesteter, writing in the _Contemporary Review_, July,\r\n1898, points out that even so well informed an observer of French life\r\nas the author of that remarkable book failed to appreciate the steadying\r\ninfluence exercised upon the French body politic by the network of\r\nvoluntary associations, the _syndicats agricoles_, which are the\r\nanalogues and, to some extent, the prototypes, in France of our\r\nagricultural societies in Ireland. The late Mr. Hanbury, during his too\r\nbrief career as President of the Board of Agriculture, frequently dwelt\r\nupon the importance of organising similar associations in England as a\r\nnecessary step in the development of the new agricultural policy which\r\nhe foreshadowed. His successor, Lord Onslow, has fully endorsed his\r\nviews, and in his speeches is to be found the same appreciation of the\r\nexemplary self-reliance of the Irish farmers. I have already referred to\r\nthe keen interest which both agricultural reformers and English and\r\nWelsh County Councils have been taking in the unexpectedly progressive\r\nefforts of the Irish farmers to reorganise their industry and place\r\nthemselves in a position to take advantage of State assistance. I\r\nbelieve that our farmers are going to the root of things, and that due\r\nweight should be given to the silent force of organised self-help by\r\nthose who would estimate the degree in which the aims and sanguine\r\nanticipations of the new movement in Ireland are likely to be realised.\r\n\r\nAnd it is not only for its foundation upon self-reliance that the latest\r\ndevelopment of Irish Government will have a living interest for\r\neconomists and students of political philosophy. They will see in the\r\nfacts under review a rapid and altogether healthy evolution of the Irish\r\npolicy so honourably associated with the name of Mr. Arthur Balfour. His\r\nChief Secretaryship, when all its storm and stress have been forgotten,\r\nwill be remembered for the opening up of the desolate, poverty-stricken\r\nwestern seaboard by light railways, and for the creation of the\r\nCongested Districts Board. The latter institution has gained so wide\r\nand, as I think, well merited popularity, that many thought its\r\nextension to other parts of Ireland would have been a simpler and safer\r\nmethod of procedure than that actually recommended by the Recess\r\nCommittee, and adopted by Mr. Gerald Balfour. The Land Act of 1891\r\napplied a treatment to the problem of the congested districts--a problem\r\nof economic depression and industrial backwardness, differing rather in\r\ndegree than in kind from the economic problem of the greater part of\r\nrural Ireland--as simple as it was new. A large capital sum of Irish\r\nmoneys was handed over to an unpaid commission consisting of Irishmen\r\nwho were acquainted with the local circumstances, and who were in a\r\nposition to give their services to a public philanthropic purpose. They\r\nwere given the widest discretion in the expenditure of the interest of\r\nthis capital sum, and from time to time their income has been augmented\r\nfrom annually voted moneys. They were restricted only to measures\r\ncalculated permanently to improve the condition of the people, as\r\ndistinct from measures affording temporary relief.\r\n\r\nI agree with those who hold that Mr. Arthur Balfour's plan was the best\r\nthat could be adopted at the moment. But events have marched rapidly\r\nsince 1891, and wholly new possibilities in the sphere of Irish economic\r\nlegislation and administration have been revealed. A new Irish mind has\r\nnow to be taken into account, and to be made part of any ameliorative\r\nIrish policy. Hence it was not only possible, but desirable, to\r\nadminister State help more democratically in 1899 than in 1891. The\r\npolicy of the Congested Districts Board was a notable advance upon the\r\ninaction of the State in the pre-famine times, and upon the system of\r\ndoles and somewhat objectless relief works of the latter half of the\r\nnineteenth century; but the policy of the new departure now under review\r\nwas no less notable a departure from the paternalism of the Congested\r\nDistricts Board. When that body was called into existence it was thought\r\nnecessary to rely on persons nominated by the Government. When the\r\nDepartment was created eight years later it was found possible, owing to\r\nthe broadening of the basis of local government and to the moral and\r\nsocial effect of the new movement, to rely largely on the advice and\r\nassistance of persons selected by the people themselves.\r\n\r\nThe two departments are in constant consultation as to the co-ordination\r\nof their work, so as to avoid conflict of administrative system and\r\nsociological principle in adjoining districts; and much has already been\r\ndone in this direction. My own experience has not only made me a firm\r\nbeliever in the principle of self-help, but I carry my belief to the\r\nextreme length of holding that the poorer a community is the more\r\nessential is it to throw it as much as possible on its own resources, in\r\norder to develop self-reliance. I recognise, however, the undesirability\r\nof too sudden changes of system in these matters. Meanwhile, I may add\r\nin this connection that the Wyndham Land Act enormously increases the\r\nimportance of the Congested Districts Board in regard to its main\r\nfunction--that of dealing directly with congestion, by the purchase and\r\nresettlement of estates, the migration of families, and the enlargement\r\nof holdings.[46]\r\n\r\nI have now said enough about the aims and objects, the constitution and\r\npowers, and the relations with other Governmental institutions, of the\r\nnew Department, to enable the reader to form a fairly accurate estimate\r\nof its general character, scope and purpose. From what it is I shall\r\npass in the next chapter to what it does, and there I must describe its\r\neveryday work in some detail. But I wish I could also give the reader an\r\nadequate picture of the surge of activities raised by the first plunge\r\nof the Department into Irish life and thought. After a time the torrent\r\nof business made channels for itself and went on in a more orderly\r\nfashion; practical ideas and promising openings were sifted out at an\r\nearly stage of their approach to the Department from those which were\r\nneither one nor the other; time was economised, work distributed, and\r\nthe functions of demand and supply in relation to the Department's work\r\nthroughout Ireland were brought into proper adjustment with each other.\r\nYet, even at first, to a sympathetic and understanding view, the waste\r\nof time and thought involved in dealing with impossible projects and\r\ndispelling false hopes was compensated for by the evidence forced upon\r\nus that the Irish people had no notion of regarding the Department as an\r\nalien institution with which they need concern themselves but little,\r\nhowever much it might concern itself with them. They were never for a\r\nmoment in doubt as to its real meaning and purpose. They meant to make\r\nit their own and to utilise it in the uplifting of their country. No\r\ndescription of the machinery of the institution could explain the real\r\nplace which it took in the life of the country from the very beginning.\r\nBut perhaps it may give the reader a more living interest in this part\r\nof the story, and a more living picture of the situation, if I try to\r\nconvey to his mind some of the impressions left on my own, by my\r\nexperiences during the period immediately following the projection of\r\nthis new phenomenon into Irish consciousness.\r\n\r\nWhen in Upper Merrion-street, Dublin, opposite to the Land Commission,\r\nbig brass plates appeared upon the doors of a row of houses announcing\r\nthat there was domiciled the Department of Agriculture and Technical\r\nInstruction, the average man in the street might have been expected to\r\nmurmur, 'Another Castle Board,' and pass on. It was not long, however,\r\nbefore our visiting list became somewhat embarrassing. We have since got\r\ndown, as I have said, to a more humdrum, though no less interesting,\r\nofficial life inside the Department. But let the reader imagine himself\r\nto have been concealed behind a screen in my office on a day when some\r\nevent, like the Dublin Horse Show, brought crowds in from the country to\r\nthe Irish capital. Such an experience would certainly have given him a\r\nnew understanding of some then neglected men and things. While I was\r\nopening the morning's letters and dealing with \"Files\" marked \"urgent,\"\r\nhe would see nothing to distinguish my day's work from that of other\r\nministers, who act as a link between the permanent officials of a\r\nspending Department and the Government of the day. But presently a\r\nstream of callers would set in, and he would begin to realise that the\r\nminister is, in this case, a human link of another kind--a link between\r\nthe people and the Government. A courteous and discreet Private\r\nSecretary, having attended to those who have come to the wrong\r\ndepartment, and to those who are satisfied with an interview with him or\r\nwith the officer who would have to attend to their particular business,\r\nbrings into my not august presence a procession of all sorts and\r\nconditions of men. Some know me personally, some bring letters of\r\nintroduction or want to see me on questions of policy. Others--for these\r\nthe human link is most needed--must see the ultimate source of\r\nresponsibility, which, in Ireland, whether it be head of a family or of\r\na Department, is reduced from the abstract to the concrete by the\r\npregnant pronoun 'himself.' I cannot reveal confidences, but I may give\r\na few typical instances of, let us say, callers who might have called.\r\n\r\nFirst comes a visitor, who turns out to be a 'man with an idea,' just\r\nhome from an unpronounceable address in Scandinavia. He has come to tell\r\nme that we have in Ireland a perfect gold mine, if we only knew it--in\r\nextent never was there such a gold field--no illusory pockets--good\r\npayable stuff in sight for centuries to come--and so on for five\r\nprecious minutes, which seem like half a day, during which I have\r\nrealised that he is an inventor, and that it is no good asking him to\r\ncome to the point. But I keep my eye riveted on his leather bag which is\r\nfilled to bursting point, and manifest an intelligent interest and\r\nburning curiosity. The suggestion works, and out of the bag come black\r\nbars and balls, samples of fabrics ranging from sack-cloth to fine\r\nlinen, buttons, combs, papers for packing and for polite correspondence,\r\nbottles of queer black fluid, and a host of other miscellaneous wares. I\r\nrealise that the particular solution of the Irish Question which is\r\nabout to be unfolded is the utilisation of our bogs. Well, this _is_\r\none of the problems with which we have to deal. It is physically\r\npossible to make almost anything out of this Irish asset, from moss\r\nlitter to billiard balls, and though one would not think it, aeons of\r\nenergy have been stored in these inert looking wastes by the apparently\r\nunsympathetic sun, energy which some think may, before long, be\r\nconverted into electricity to work all the smokeless factories which the\r\nrising generation are to see. Indeed, the vista of possibilities is\r\nendless, the only serious problem that remains to be solved being 'how\r\nto make it pay,' and upon that aspect of the question, unhappily, my\r\nvisitor had no light to throw.\r\n\r\nThe next visitor, who brings with him a son and a daughter, is himself\r\nthe product of an Irish bog in the wildest of the wilds. His Parish\r\nPriest had sent him to me. A little awkwardness, which is soon\r\ndispelled, and the point is reached. This fine specimen of the 'bone and\r\nsinew' has had a hard struggle to bring up his 'long family'; but, with\r\na capable wife, who makes the most of the _res angusta domi_--of the\r\npig, the poultry, and even of the butter from the little black cows on\r\nthe mountain--he has risen to the extent of his opportunities. The\r\nchildren are all doing something. Lace and crochet come out of the\r\ncabin, the yarn from the wool of the 'mountainy' sheep, carded and spun\r\nat home, is feeding the latest type of hosiery knitting machine and the\r\nhereditary handloom. The story of this man's life which was written to\r\nme by the priest cannot find space here. The immediate object of his\r\nvisit is to get his eldest daughter trained as a poultry instructress to\r\ntake part in some of the 'County Schemes' under the Department, and to\r\nobtain for his eldest son, who has distinguished himself under the\r\ntuition of the Christian Brothers, a travelling scholarship. For this he\r\nhas been recommended by his teachers. They had marked this bright boy\r\nout as an ideal agricultural instructor, and if I could give the reader\r\nall the particulars of the case it would be a rare illustration of the\r\nlatent human resources we mean to develop in the Ireland that is to be.\r\nI explain that the young man must pass a qualifying examination, but am\r\nglad to be able to admit that the circumstances of his life, which would\r\nhave to be taken into account in deciding between the qualified, are in\r\nhis case of a kind likely to secure favourable consideration.\r\n\r\nAnd now enters a sporting friend of mine, a 'practical angler,' who\r\ncomes with a very familiar tale of woe. The state of the salmon\r\nfisheries is deplorable: if the Department does not fulfil its obvious\r\nduties there will not be a salmon in Ireland outside a museum in ten\r\nyears more. He has lived for forty-five years on the banks of a salmon\r\nriver, and he knows that I don't fish. But this much the conversation\r\nreveals: his own knowledge of the subject is confined to the piece of\r\nriver he happens to own, the gossip he hears at his club, and the ideas\r\nof the particular poacher he employs as his gillie. His suggested remedy\r\nis the abolition of all netting. But I have to tell him that only the\r\nday before I had a deputation from the net fishermen in the estuary of\r\nthis very river, whose bitter complaint was that this 'poor man's\r\nindustry' was being destroyed by the mackerel and herring nets round the\r\ncoast, and--I thought my friend would have a fit--by the way in which\r\nthe gentlemen on the upper waters neglect their duty of protecting the\r\nspawning fish! Some belonging to the lower water interest carried their\r\nscepticism as to the efficacy of artificial propagation to the length of\r\nbelieving that hatcheries are partially responsible for the decrease. As\r\nso often happens, the opposing interests, disagreeing on all else, find\r\nthat best of peacemakers, a common enemy, in the Government. The\r\nDepartment is responsible--for two opposite reasons, it is true, but\r\nsomehow they seem to confirm each other. We must labour to find some\r\nother common ground, starting from the recognition that the salmon\r\nfisheries are a national asset which must be made to subserve the\r\ngeneral public interest. I assure my friend that when all parties make\r\ntheir proper contribution in effort and in cash, the Department will not\r\nbe backward in doing their part.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this interview a messenger brings a telegram for 'himself'\r\nfrom a stockowner in a remote district.[47] 'My pigs,' runs one of the\r\nmost businesslike communications I ever received, 'are all spotted.\r\nWhat shall I do?' I send it to the Veterinary Branch, which, with the\r\nBoard of Agriculture in England, is engaged in a scheme for staying the\r\nravages of swine fever, a scheme into which the late Mr. Hanbury threw\r\nhimself with his characteristic energy. The problem is of immense\r\nimportance, and the difficulty is not mainly quadrupedal. Unless the\r\npolice 'spot' the spotted pigs, we too often hear nothing about them. I\r\nam sure it must be daily brought home to the English Board, as it is to\r\nthe Irish Department, that an enormous addition might be made to the\r\nwealth of the country if our veterinary officers were intelligently and\r\nactively aided, in their difficult duties for the protection of our\r\nflocks and herds, by those most immediately concerned.\r\n\r\nSo far it has been an interesting morning bright with the activities out\r\nof which the future is to be made. The element of hope has predominated,\r\nbut now comes a visitor who wishes to see me upon the one part of my\r\nduties and responsibilities which is distasteful to me--the exercise of\r\npatronage. He has been unloaded upon me by an influential person, upon\r\nwhom he has more legitimate claims than upon the Department. He has\r\nprepared the way for a favourable reception by getting his friends to\r\nwrite to my friends, many of whom have already fulfilled a promise to\r\ninterview me in his behalf. His mother and two maiden aunts have written\r\nletters which have drawn from my poor Private Secretary, who has to read\r\nthem all, the dry quotation, 'there's such a thing as being so good as\r\nto be good for nothing.' The young hopeful quickly puts an end to my\r\nspeculations as to the exact capacity in which he means to serve the\r\nDepartment by applying for an inspectorship. I ask him what he proposes\r\nto inspect, and the sum and substance of his reply is that he is not\r\nparticular, but would not mind beginning at a moderate salary, say £200\r\na year. As for his qualifications, they are a sadly minus quantity, his\r\nblighted career having included failure for the army, and a clerkship in\r\na bank, which only lasted a week when he proved to be deficient in the\r\nsecond and dangerous in the third of the three R's. His case reminds me\r\nof a story of my ranching days, which the exercise of patronage has so\r\noften recalled to my mind that I must out with it. Riding into camp one\r\nevening, I turned my horse loose and got some supper, which was a vilely\r\ncooked meal even for a cow camp. Recognising in the cook a cowboy I had\r\nformerly employed, I said to him, 'You were a way up cow hand, but as\r\ncook you are no account. Why did you give up riding and take to cooking?\r\nWhat are your qualifications as a cook any way?' 'Qualifications!' he\r\nreplied, 'why, don't you know I've got varicose veins?' My caller's\r\nqualifications are of an equally negative description, though not of a\r\nphysical kind. He is one of the young Micawbers, to whom the Department\r\nfrom its first inception has been the something which was to turn up. He\r\nhad, of course, testimonials which in any other country would have\r\ncommanded success by their terms and the position of the signatories,\r\nbut which in Ireland only illustrate the charity with which we condone\r\nour moral cowardice under the name of good nature. I am glad when this\r\ninterview closes.\r\n\r\nOne more type--a Nationalist Member of Parliament! He does not often\r\ndarken the door of a Government office--they all have the same\r\nstructural defect, no front stairs--he never has asked and never thought\r\nhe would ask anything from the Government. But he is interested in some\r\npoor fishermen of County Clare who pursue their calling under cruel\r\ndisadvantages for want of the protection from the Atlantic rollers which\r\na small breakwater would afford. It is true that they were the worst\r\nconstituents he had--- went against him in 'The Split,'--but if I saw\r\nhow they lived, and so on. I knew all about the case. A breakwater to be\r\nof any use would cost a very large sum, and the local authority, though\r\nsympathetic, did not see their way to contribute their proportion, and\r\nwithout a local contribution, I explained, the Department could not,\r\nconsistently with its principles, unless in most exceptional--Here he\r\nbreaks in: 'Oh! that red tape. You're as bad as the rest--exceptional,\r\nindeed! Why, everything is exceptional in my constituency. I am a bit\r\nthat way myself. But, seriously, the condition of these poor people\r\nwould move even a Government official. Besides, you remember the night I\r\nmade thirteen speeches on the Naval Estimates--the Government wanted a\r\nlittle matter of twenty millions--and you met me in the Lobby and told\r\nme you wished to go to bed, and asked me what I really wanted, and--I\r\nam always reasonable--I said I would pass the whole Naval Programme if I\r\ngot the Government to give them a boat-slip at Ballyduck.--\"Done!\" you\r\nsaid, and we both went home.--I believe you knew that I had got\r\nconstituency matters mixed up, that Ballyduck was inland, and that it\r\nwas Ballycrow that I meant to say.--But you won't deny that you are\r\nunder a moral obligation.'\r\n\r\nWell, I would go into the matter again very carefully--for I thought we\r\nmight help these fishermen in some other way--and write to him. He\r\nleaves me; and, while outside the door he travels over the main points\r\nwith my Private Secretary, the lights and shades in the picture which\r\nthis strange personality has left on my mind throw me back behind the\r\npractical things of to-day. In Parliament facing the Sassanach, in\r\nIreland facing their police, he has for years--the best years of his\r\nlife--displayed the same love of fighting for fighting's sake. In the\r\nriots he has provoked, and they are not a few, he is ever regardless of\r\nhis own skin, and would be truly miserable if he inflicted any serious\r\nbodily harm on a human being--even a landlord. It is impossible not to\r\nlike this very human anachronism, who, within the limitations imposed by\r\nthe convenience of a citizenship to which he unwillingly belongs, does\r\nbattle\r\n\r\n    For Faith, and Fame, and Honour, and the ruined hearths of Clare.\r\n\r\nThe reader may take all this as fiction. I am sure no one will annoy me\r\nby trying on any of the caps I have displayed on the counter of my\r\nshop. What I do fear is that the picture of some of my duties which I\r\nhave given may have made a wrong impression of the Department's work\r\nupon the reader's mind. He may have come to the conclusion that,\r\ncontrary to all the principles laid down, an attempt was being made to\r\ndo for the people things which the new movement was to induce the people\r\nto do for themselves. The Department may appear to be using its official\r\nposition and Government funds to constitute itself a sort of Universal\r\nProvidence, exercising an authority and a discretion over matters upon\r\nwhich in any progressive community the people must decide for\r\nthemselves. However near to the appearances such an impression might be,\r\nnothing could be further from the facts. If I have helped the reader to\r\nunravel the tangled skein of our national life, if I have sufficiently\r\nrevealed the mind of the new movement to show that there is in it 'a\r\nscheme of things entire,' it should be quite clear that the deliberate\r\nintentions both of Mr. Gerald Balfour and of those Irishmen whom he took\r\ninto his confidence are being fulfilled in letter and in spirit. It only\r\nremains for me to attempt an adequate description of the work of the\r\nDepartment created by that Chief Secretary, and, above all, of the way\r\nin which the people themselves are playing the part which his\r\nstatesmanship assigned to them.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[44] See Report of the Local Government Board, 1901-2.\r\n\r\n[45] See Annual General Report of the Department 1900-1901, pp. 25-27.\r\n\r\n[46] _Cf. ante_, pp. 46-49.\r\n\r\n[47] No fiction about this, nor about the following letter to the\r\nSecretary:--\r\n\r\n'The Scratatory, Vitny Dept.\r\n\r\n'Honord Sir,\r\n\r\n'I want to let ye know the terible state we're in now. Al the pigs about\r\nhere is dyin in showers. Send down a Vit at oncet.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT WITH THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter I attempted to give to the reader a rough\r\nimpression of the general purpose and miscellaneous functions of the new\r\nDepartment. I described in some detail the constitution and powers of\r\nthe Council of Agriculture--a sort of Business Parliament--which\r\ncriticises our doings and elects representatives on our Boards; and of\r\nthe two Boards which, in addition to their advisory functions, possess\r\nthe power of the purse. I laid special stress upon the important part\r\nthese instruments of the popular will were intended to play as a link\r\nbetween the people and the Department. I gave a similar description and\r\nexplanation of the Committees of Agriculture and Technical Instruction,\r\nappointed by local representative bodies, by means of which the people\r\nwere brought into touch with the local as distinct from the central\r\nwork, and made responsible for its success. The details were necessarily\r\ndull; and so also must be those which will now be required in order to\r\nindicate the general nature and scope of the work for the accomplishment\r\nof which all this machinery was designed. Yet I am not without hope\r\nthat even the general reader may find a deep human interest in the\r\npractical endeavour of the humbler classes of my fellow-countrymen to\r\nreconstruct their national life upon the solid foundation of honest\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe Department has at the time of writing been in existence for three\r\nyears, the term of office, it will be remembered, of the Council of\r\nAgriculture and of the two Boards. It would be unreasonable to expect in\r\nso short a time any great achievement; but the understanding critic will\r\nattach importance rather to the spirit in which the work was approached\r\nthan to the actual amount of work which was accomplished. He may say\r\nthat no true estimate of its value can be formed until the enthusiasm\r\naroused by its novelty has had time to wear off. Those of us who know\r\nthe real character of the work are quite satisfied that the interest\r\nwhich it aroused during the period in which the people had yet to grasp\r\nits meaning and utility is not likely to become less real as the blossom\r\nfades and the fruit begins to swell. The attitude of the Irish people\r\ntowards the Department and its work has not been that of a child towards\r\na new toy, but of a full-grown man towards a piece of his life's work,\r\nupon which he feels that he entered all too late. Indeed, so quickly\r\nhave the people grasped the significance of the new opportunities for\r\nmaterial advancement now placed within their reach, that the Department\r\nhas had to carry out, and to assist the statutory local committees in\r\ncarrying out, a number and variety of schemes which, at any rate, proved\r\nthat public opinion did not regard it as a transitory experiment; but\r\nas a much-needed institution which, if properly utilised, might do much\r\nto make up for lost time, and which, in any case, had come to stay. The\r\namount of the work which we were thus constrained to undertake was\r\nsomewhat embarrassing; but so general and so genuine was the desire to\r\nmake a start that we have done our best to keep pace with the local\r\ndemands for immediate action. The staff of the Department caught the\r\nspirit in which the task had been set by the country, and showed a keen\r\nanxiety to get to work; and I am glad to have an opportunity of\r\nacknowledging that both the indoor and outdoor support it has received\r\nleaves the Department without excuse if it has not already justified its\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nI shall deal as mercifully as I can with my readers in helping them\r\ntowards an understanding of what has been actually done in the three\r\nyears under review. I am aware that if I were to attempt a description\r\nof all the schemes which the variety of local needs suggested, and in\r\nthe execution of which the assistance of the many-sided Department was\r\nsought and obtained, I should lose the patient readers, who have not\r\nalready fainted by the way, in a jungle where they could not see the\r\nwood for the trees. These things can be studied by those\r\ninterested,--and they I hope, in Ireland at any rate, are not few--in\r\nthe Annual Reports and other official publications of the Department.\r\nFor the general reader I must try to indicate in broad outline the\r\nnature and scope of that side of the new movement which seeks to\r\nsupplement organised self-help and open the way for individual\r\nenterprise by a well considered measure of State assistance. I shall be\r\nmore than satisfied if I succeed in giving him a clear insight into the\r\nmanner in which the delicate task of making State interference with the\r\nbusiness of the people not only harmless but beneficial has been set\r\nabout. It is obvious that the fulfilment of this object must depend upon\r\nthe soundness of the economic policy pursued, and upon the establishment\r\nand maintenance of mutual confidence between the central authority and\r\nthe popular representative bodies through which the people utilise the\r\nnew facilities afforded by the State.\r\n\r\nI think the best way of giving the information which is required for an\r\nunderstanding of our somewhat complicated scheme for agricultural and\r\nindustrial development under democratic control is first to explain the\r\nline of demarcation which we have drawn between the respective functions\r\nof the Department and the people's committees throughout the country;\r\nand then I must give a rapid description of some of the most important\r\nfeatures of the Department's policy and programme. I shall add a\r\nsufficiency of detail from the actual work accomplished in these\r\norganising and experimental years, to illustrate both the difficulties\r\nwhich are incidental to such a policy, and the manner in which these\r\ndifficulties may be surmounted.\r\n\r\nWhen it became manifest that both the country and the Department were\r\nanxious to drive ahead, the first thing to do was to lay down a _modus\r\noperandi_ which would assign to the local and central bodies their\r\nproper shares in the work and responsibilities and secure some degree of\r\norder and uniformity in administration. This was quickly done, and the\r\nplan adopted works smoothly. The Department gives the local committee\r\ngeneral information as to the kind of purpose to which it can legally\r\nand properly apply the funds jointly contributed from the rates and the\r\ncentral exchequer. The committee, after full consideration of the\r\nconditions, needs and industrial environment of the community for which\r\nit acts, selects certain definite projects which it considers most\r\napplicable to its district, allocates the amount required to each\r\nproject, and sends the scheme to the Department for its approval. When\r\nthe scheme is formally approved, it becomes the official scheme in the\r\nlocality for the current year; and the local committee has to carry it\r\nout.\r\n\r\nAlthough harmony now usually exists between the local and central\r\nauthorities to the advantage and comfort of both, a considerable amount\r\nof friction was inevitable until they got to understand each other. The\r\noccasional over-riding of local desires by the 'autocratic' Department,\r\nwhich in the first rush of its work had to act in a somewhat peremptory\r\nfashion, was, no doubt, irritating. Now, however, it is generally\r\nrecognised that the central body, having not only the advice of its\r\nexperts and access to information from similar Departments in other\r\ncountries to guide it, but also being in a position to profit by the\r\nexchange of ideas which is constantly going on between it and all the\r\nlocal committees in Ireland, is in a position of special advantage for\r\ndeciding as to the bearing of local schemes upon national interests, and\r\nsometimes even as to their soundness from a purely local point of view.\r\n\r\nPassing now from the conditions under which the Department's work is\r\ndone, we come to review some typical portions of the work itself so far\r\nas it has proceeded. This falls naturally, both as regards that which is\r\ndone by the central authority for the country at large and that which is\r\nlocally administered, into two divisions. The first consists of direct\r\naid to agriculture and other rural industries, and to sea and inland\r\nfisheries. The second consists of indirect aid given to these objects,\r\nand also to town manufactures and commerce, through education--a term\r\nwhich must be interpreted in its widest sense. Needless to say, direct\r\naids, being tangible and immediately beneficial, are the more popular: a\r\nbull, a boat, or a hand-loom is more readily appreciated than a lecture,\r\na leaflet, or an idea. Yet in the Department we all realise--and, what\r\nis more important, the people are coming to realise--that by far the\r\nmost important work we have to do is that which belongs to the sphere of\r\neducation, especially education which has a distinctly practical aim. To\r\nthis branch of the subject I shall, therefore, first direct the reader's\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that, for reasons fully set out in the earlier\r\nportions of the book, I am treating the Irish Question as being, in its\r\nmost important economic and social aspects, the problem of rural life.\r\nThe Department's scheme of technical instruction, therefore, need not\r\nhere be detailed in its application to the needs of our few\r\nmanufacturing towns, but only in its application to agriculture and the\r\nsubsidiary industries. I do not suggest that the questions relating to\r\nthe revival of industry in our large manufacturing centres and\r\nprovincial towns are not of the first importance. The local authorities\r\nin these places have eagerly come into the movement, and the Department\r\nhas already taken part in founding, in our cities and larger towns,\r\ncomprehensive schemes of technical education, as to the outcome of which\r\nwe have every reason to be hopeful. Not only that, but it is highly\r\nnecessary for the Department to consider these schemes in close relation\r\nto its work upon the more specially rural problems, for, as I have said\r\nelsewhere,[48] the interdependence of town and country, and the\r\nestablishment of proper relations between their systems of industry and\r\neducation, is a prime factor in Irish prosperity. But the rural problem,\r\nas I have so often reiterated, is the core of the Irish Question; and to\r\ndeal at all adequately with technical education, so far as we carry it\r\non upon lines common both to Great Britain and Ireland, would lead us\r\ntoo far afield on the present occasion. I must, therefore, content\r\nmyself with indicating my reasons for leaving it rather on one side, and\r\npass on to a brief description of the Department's educational work in\r\nrespect of its two-fold aim of developing agriculture and the subsidiary\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nIn the case of agriculture our task is perfectly plain. We know pretty\r\nwell what we want to do, for we are dealing with an existing industry,\r\nand with known conditions. The productivity of the soil, the demand of\r\nthe market, the means of transport from the one to the other, are all\r\neasily ascertainable. What most needs to be provided in Ireland is a\r\nmuch higher technical skill, a more advanced scientific and commercial\r\nknowledge, as applied to agricultural production and distribution.[49]\r\nThis, in our belief, depends, more than upon any other agency, upon the\r\nsoundness of the education which is provided to develop the capacities\r\nof those in charge of these operations. Our chief difficulty is that of\r\nco-ordinating our teaching of technical agriculture with the general\r\neducational systems of the country--a difficulty which the other\r\neducational authorities are all united with us in seeking to remove.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the other hand, education--again, I believe, the chief agency\r\nfor the purpose--is considered as a means for the creation of new\r\nindustries, we come face to face with a wholly different problem. We\r\nhave no longer an industry which we are seeking to foster and develop\r\ngoing on under our eyes, steadying us in our theorising, and in our\r\nexperimenting upon the mind of the worker, by bringing us into close\r\ntouch with the actual conditions of his work. Our chief aim must be to\r\ndevelop his adaptability for the ever-changing and, we hope, improving\r\neconomic industrial conditions amidst which he will have to work. But\r\nunless we can satisfy parents that the schemes of development in which\r\ntheir children are being educated to take their place have an assured\r\nprospect of practical realisation, they will naturally prefer an\r\ninferior teaching which seems to them to offer a better prospect of an\r\nimmediate wage or salary. The teachers in the secondary schools of the\r\ncountry, who, so far, have shown a desire to assist us in giving an\r\nindustrial and commercial direction to our educational policy, would\r\nalso in that event have to meet the wishes of the parents; and thus\r\neducation would fall back into the old rut with its cramming, its\r\nexaminations and result fees--all leading to the multiplication of\r\nclerks and professional men, and preventing us from turning the thoughts\r\nand energies of the people towards productive occupations.\r\n\r\nThe natural trend of our educational policy will now be clear. Leaving\r\nout of account large towns, where our problem is, as I have said, the\r\nsame as that which confronts the industrial classes in the manufacturing\r\ncentres of Great Britain, we are chiefly concerned with the application\r\nof science to the cultivation of the soil and the improvement of live\r\nstock, and of business principles to the commercial side of farming;\r\nwith the teaching of dairying, horticulture, apiculture, and what has\r\nbeen called farm-yard lore, outside the rural home, and with domestic\r\neconomy inside. On the industrial as distinct from the agricultural side\r\nof the work in rural localities, technical instruction must be directed\r\ntowards the development of subsidiary rural industries.\r\n\r\nWe early came to the conclusion that we could not expect to find a\r\nsystem which we could simply transplant from some other country. The\r\nsystem adopted in Great Britain, where each county or group of counties\r\nmaintains an agricultural college and an experimental farm, and many\r\nmore elaborate systems on the continent, were all found on examination\r\nto be inapplicable to our own rural conditions, unsuitable to the\r\nnational character, and unrelated to the history of our agriculture.\r\nMany of these schemes might have turned out a few highly qualified\r\nauthorities on the theory of agriculture, and even good practical\r\ndirectors for those who farm on a large scale. But we are dealing with a\r\ncountry with great possibilities from an agricultural point of view, but\r\nwhere, nevertheless, agriculture in many parts is in a very backward\r\ncondition, and where it is probably safe to say that three-fifths of the\r\nfarms are crowded on one-fourth of the land. We are dealing with a\r\ncommunity with whom the systems of elementary, secondary and higher\r\neducation have not tended to prepare the student for agricultural\r\npursuits. A system of agricultural and domestic education suited to the\r\nwants of those who are to farm the land must recognise and foster the\r\nnew spirit of self-help and hope which is springing up in the country,\r\nand must be made so interesting as to become a serious rival to the race\r\nmeeting and the public-house. The daily drudgery of farm work must be\r\ncounteracted by the ambition to possess the best stock, the neatest\r\nhomestead and fences, the cleanest and the best tilled fields. The\r\nunsolved problem of agricultural education is to devise a system which\r\nwill reach down to the small working farmers who form the great bulk of\r\nthe wealth producers of Ireland, to give them new hope, a new interest,\r\nnew knowledge and, I might add, a new industrial character.\r\n\r\nWe were met at the outset by the difficulty which would apply to any\r\nsystem--that of finding trained teachers. This deficiency was felt in\r\ntwo directions--first, in the secondary school, in which the preliminary\r\nscientific studies should be undertaken, which are necessary to enable a\r\nlad to profit by more advanced instruction later on; and, secondly, in\r\nthe special training of technical agriculture. It would not have been\r\ndesirable to overcome these difficulties by any very extensive\r\nimportation of teachers from without. I certainly hold the occasional\r\nimportation of teachers with outside experience to be most desirable,\r\nbut these should not form more than a leaven of the pedagogic lump; for\r\nit is a serious hindrance when to the task of familiarising students\r\nwith a new system of education there is added that of familiarising a\r\nlarge body of teachers with the intellectual, social and economic\r\nconditions of the people among whom they are to work.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the teacher difficulty was surmounted may be briefly\r\nstated, first, as regards the school, and, secondly, as regards the\r\nteaching of agriculture. Those already engaged in the teaching\r\nprofession could not be relegated again to the _status pupillaris_.\r\nThere was only one way in which they could assist us to overcome the\r\ndifficulty, and that involved a great sacrifice on their part, the\r\nsacrifice of their well-earned vacation, but a sacrifice which they\r\nwillingly made. The teachers most urgently needed were those of\r\npractical science, with knowledge of experimental work; and about five\r\nhundred teachers from secondary schools, in order to qualify themselves,\r\nhave attended summer courses specially organised by the Department at\r\nseveral centres in Ireland, while about four hundred have availed\r\nthemselves of special summer courses in such subjects as drawing, manual\r\ninstruction, domestic economy, building construction, wood-carving and\r\nmodelling.\r\n\r\nFor the provision of a future supply of thoroughly trained teachers of\r\nscience and of technology, including agriculture, the Royal College of\r\nScience has been re-organised. Although this institution was brought\r\nunder the new conditions little more than three years ago, it will be\r\nseen that no time has been lost when I state that the first batch of men\r\nwho have received a three years' course of training under the new\r\nprogramme are already at work under County Committees. For the training\r\nof these teachers, scholarships had to be provided, and new professors\r\nand teachers, particularly in agriculture, had to be appointed.\r\n\r\nIn regard to agricultural instruction we had to begin by carefully\r\nconsidering what, among many alternative plans, should be our immediate\r\nas well as our more remote aims. The Department's officers had studied\r\nContinental systems, and some of them had taken part in establishing\r\nsystems of agricultural education in Great Britain. But it was not until\r\nthe summer of 1901 that we had sufficiently studied the question in\r\nIreland itself, with direct reference to the history, the environment,\r\nand the ideals of the people, to justify us in initiating a policy or\r\nformulating a definite programme for its execution.[50] The main object\r\nwas to secure for the youth of the present generation who will later be\r\nconcerned with agriculture, sound and thorough instruction in its\r\nprinciples and practice. Everyone who has given any thought to the\r\nsubject knows how difficult it is to teach technical agriculture unless\r\nprovision has been made in the general education of the country for\r\ninstruction in those fundamental principles of science which, recognised\r\nor unrecognised, lie at the root of, and profoundly influence\r\nagricultural practice. This foundation, as I have shown, is now being\r\nlaid in Ireland. In our scheme the boy who has managed to avail himself\r\nof a two or three years' course of practical science in one of the\r\nsecondary schools is then prepared to take full advantage of courses of\r\ntechnology, and will have to make up his mind as to the career he is to\r\nfollow. We are now considering the case of a boy who is going to become\r\na farmer, the class to which we chiefly look for the future well-being\r\nof Ireland. It is necessary that he should be taught the practical as\r\nwell as the technical side of agriculture. The practical work he can\r\nlearn upon his father's farm during spring and summer, and the technical\r\nby continuing his studies during the winter months in a school of\r\nagriculture. The establishment of such winter schools is in\r\ncontemplation. But, in the meanwhile, to bring home to farmers the\r\nadvantages of a first-class agricultural education for their sons, and\r\nat the same time to teach these farmers the more practical application\r\nof science to agriculture, the Department decided on a preliminary\r\nperiod of Itinerant Instruction.\r\n\r\nThe teacher difficulty, experienced on all sides of our work, was\r\nprobably felt more acutely in regard to the specialised teachers of\r\nagriculture than in any other connection. Here it was necessary to take\r\nthe young men brought up upon farms and possessed of the normal\r\nqualifications of the Irish practical farmer. We then had to make them\r\ninto teachers by adding to their inherited and home-manufactured\r\ncapacities a scientific training. In the training of agricultural\r\nteachers the Albert Institute, Glasnevin, has been utilised by the\r\nDepartment. This school has also been re-organised to meet the new\r\nprogramme, and it will probably form in future a link between the winter\r\nschools of agriculture and the Royal College of Science in the training\r\nof our agricultural teachers.\r\n\r\nPartly by these methods, partly by the temporary engagement of lecturers\r\non special subjects, and partly by the appointment of trained teachers\r\nfrom England or Scotland, the system of itinerant instruction has been\r\nbrought into operation as fully as could be expected in the time.\r\nAlready half the County Committees have been provided with County\r\ninstructors, while the remainder have nearly all drafted schemes and\r\nallocated funds for a similar purpose, ready to go to work as soon as\r\nmore teachers have been trained.\r\n\r\nThe Itinerant Instruction scheme, it may be pointed out, besides one\r\nobvious, has another less immediately recognisable purpose. The direct\r\nbusiness of the itinerant instructor is, by the aid of experimental\r\nplots, simple lectures, and demonstrations, to teach the farmers of his\r\ndistrict as much as they can take in without the scientific preparation\r\nin which, as adults who have grown up under the old system of education,\r\nthey are still lacking. But he does more than that. He not only conducts\r\na school for adults, but in the very process of instruction he\r\nnecessarily makes them aware of the vital necessity of a school for the\r\nyoung; and they begin, as parents, to understand and to desire the kind\r\nof instruction in the schools of the country which will prepare their\r\nchildren to take more advantage of the advanced teaching in agriculture\r\nthan they themselves can ever hope to do.\r\n\r\nThis preparation is provided for as follows. To the Department, as has\r\nalready been explained, was handed over the administration of the\r\nScience and Art Grants formerly administered by South Kensington. The\r\nDepartment accordingly drew up a programme of experimental science and\r\ndrawing, carrying capitation grants, for day secondary schools. The\r\nIntermediate Education Board, acting on the suggestion of the\r\nConsultative Committee for Co-ordinating Education,[51] adopted this\r\nprogramme and at the same time undertook to accept the reports of the\r\nDepartment's inspectors as the basis of their awards in the new\r\n\"subject.\" These steps insured the rapid and general introduction of\r\nthis practical teaching in secondary schools, and, owing particularly to\r\nthe spirit in which their authorities and teaching staffs accepted the\r\ninnovation, the work has been carried out with the happiest results.\r\n\r\nI now come to the subjects grouped together under the classification of\r\n'domestic economy.' These differ only in detail in their application to\r\ntown and country. To these subjects the Department attaches great\r\nimportance. In the industrial life of manufacturing towns I am persuaded\r\nthat far too little thought has been given to this element of industrial\r\nefficiency. From a purely economic point of view a saving in the\r\nworker's income due to superior housewifery is equivalent to an increase\r\nin his earnings; but, morally, the superior thrift is, of course,\r\nimmensely more important. \"Without economy,\" says Dr. Johnson, \"none can\r\nbe rich, and with it few can be poor,\" and the education which only\r\nincreases the productiveness of labour and neglects the principles of\r\nwise spending will place us at a disadvantage in the great industrial\r\nstruggle. When we come to consider domestic economy as an agency for\r\nimproving the conditions of the peasant home, not only by thrift, but by\r\nincreasing the general attractiveness of home life, the introduction of\r\na sound system of domestic economy teaching becomes not only important,\r\nbut vital.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of such a system and the task of making it operative\r\nand effective in the country is beset with difficulties. The teacher\r\ndifficulty confronts us again, and also that of making pupils and their\r\nparents understand that there are other objects in domestic training\r\nthan that of qualifying for domestic service. A corps of instructresses\r\nin domestic economy is, however, already abroad throughout the country,\r\nnearly all the County Councils having already appointed them. Some of\r\nthese teachers, who have made the best contributions towards the as yet\r\nonly partially determined question of the ultimate aim and present\r\npossibilities of a course of instruction in hygiene, laundry work,\r\ncookery, the management of children, sewing, and so forth, have told me\r\nthat the demand in rural districts seems to be chiefly for the class of\r\ninstruction which may lead to success in town life. I have heard of a\r\nclass of girls in a Connaught village who would not be content with\r\nknowing the accomplishments of a farmer's wife until they had learned\r\nhow to make asparagus soup and cook sweetbreads. No doubt they had read\r\nof the way things are done in the kitchens of the great. This tendency\r\nshould never be encouraged, but neither can it always be inflexibly\r\nrepressed without endangering the main objects of the class.\r\n\r\nWomen teachers of poultry-keeping, dairying, domestic science and\r\nkindred subjects are trained at the Munster Institute, Cork, and the\r\nSchool of Domestic Economy, Kildare Street, Dublin, both of which have\r\nbeen equipped to meet the needs of the new programme. The want of\r\nteachers, and not any lack of interest on the part of the country, has\r\nalone prevented all the counties from adopting schemes for encouraging\r\nimprovement in all these branches of work. I may add that more than one\r\nhundred and fifty of these qualified teachers are now at work under\r\nCounty Committees.\r\n\r\nI have already, in this chapter, indicated that outside large industrial\r\ncentres, our educational policy is, broadly speaking, twofold. We seek,\r\nin the first place, through our programme in Experimental Science and\r\nits allied subjects, now so generally adopted by secondary schools in\r\nIreland, to give that fundamental training in science and scientific\r\nmethod which, most thinkers are agreed, constitutes a condition\r\nprecedent to sound specialised teaching of agriculture as well as other\r\nforms of industry. We seek further, by methods less academic in\r\ncharacter--for example, by itinerant instruction which is of value\r\nchiefly to those with whom 'school' is a thing of the past--to teach not\r\nonly improved agricultural methods but also simple industries, and to\r\npromote the cultivation of industrial habits which are as essential to\r\nthe success of farming as to that of every other occupation. Classes in\r\nmanual work of various kinds--woodwork, carpentry, applied drawing and\r\nbuilding construction, lace and crochet making, needlework, dressmaking\r\nand embroidery, sprigging, hosiery and other such subjects, have been\r\nnumerously and steadily attended.\r\n\r\nI do not ignore the argument that such home industries must in time give\r\nway before the competition of highly-organised factory industries. The\r\nsimple answer is that it is desirable, and indeed necessary, to employ\r\nthe energy now running to waste in our rural districts--energy which\r\ncannot in the nature of things be employed in highly-organised\r\nindustries. To the small farmer and his family, time is a realisable,\r\nthough too often unrealised, asset, and it is part of our aim to aid the\r\nfamily income by employing their waste time. Even if we can only cause\r\nthem to do at home what they now pay someone else to do, we shall not\r\nonly have improved their budget but shall have contributed to the\r\nelevation of the standard of home life, and thus, in no small measure,\r\nto the solution of the difficult problem of rural life in Ireland.\r\n\r\nI think the reader will now understand the general character of the\r\nproblem with which we were confronted and the means by which its\r\nsolution is being sought. Our policy was not one which was likely to\r\ncommend itself to the \"man in the street.\" Indeed, to be quite candid,\r\nit was a little disappointing even to myself that I could not\r\nimmortalise my appointment by erecting monuments both to my constructive\r\nability and to my educational zeal in the shape of stately edifices at\r\nconvenient railway centres, preferably along the tourist routes. We have\r\nhad to stand the fire of the critic fresh from his holiday on the\r\nContinent where he had seen agricultural and technological institutions,\r\nmagnificently housed and lavishly equipped, fitting generations of young\r\nmen and young women for competition with our less fortunate countrymen.\r\nIt is hard to prevail in argument against the man who has gone and seen\r\nfor himself. It is useless to point out to the man with a kodak that the\r\nCorinthian façade and the marble columns of the _aula maxima_ which\r\naroused his patriotic envy are but a small part of the educational\r\nstructure which he saw and thought he understood. If he would read the\r\nhistory of the systems and trace the successive stages by which the need\r\nfor these great institutions was established, he would have a little\r\nmore sympathy with the difficulties of the Department, a little more\r\npatience with its Fabian policy.\r\n\r\nI must not, however, utter a word which suggests that the Department has\r\nany ground of complaint against the country for the spirit in which it\r\nhas been met; especially as there was one factor to be taken into\r\naccount which made it difficult for public opinion to approve of our\r\npolicy. As I have already explained, a large capital sum of a little\r\nover £200,000 was handed over to the Department at its creation. During\r\nthe first year, what with the organisation of the staff, the thinking\r\nout of a policy on every side of the Department's work, the constitution\r\nof the statutory committees to administer its local schemes in town and\r\ncountry, the agreement, after long discussion, between the central body\r\nand these committees upon the local schemes, and all the other\r\npreparatory steps which had to be taken before money could wisely be\r\napplied, it is obvious that the Department could not have spent its\r\nincome. In the second year, and even the third year, savings were\r\neffected, and the original capital sum has been largely increased. What\r\nmore natural than that in a poor country a spending Department which was\r\nbackward in spending should appear to be lacking in enterprise, if not\r\nin administrative capacity? But whether the policy was right or wrong it\r\nhas unquestionably been approved by the best thought in the country, a\r\nfact which throws a very interesting light upon the constitutional\r\naspects of the Department. At each successive stage the policy was\r\ndiscussed at the Council of Agriculture and its practical operation was\r\ndependent upon the consent of the Boards which have the power of the\r\npurse. A Vice-President who had not these bodies at his back would be\r\npowerless, in fact would have to resign. Thoughtless criticism has now\r\nand again condemned not only the parsimonious action of the Department,\r\nbut the invertebrate conduct of the Council of Agriculture and the\r\nBoards in tolerating it. The time will soon come when the service\r\nrendered to their country by the members of the first Council and\r\nBoards, who gave their representative backing to a slow but sure\r\neducational policy, and scorned to seek popularity in showy projects and\r\nlocal doles, will be gratefully remembered to them.\r\n\r\nAlready we have had some gratifying evidences that the country is with\r\nus in the paramount importance we attach to education as the real need\r\nof the hour. Most readers will be surprised to hear that in the short\r\ntime the Department has been at work it has aided in the equipment of\r\nnearly two hundred science laboratories and of about fifty manual\r\ninstruction workshops, while the many-sided programme involved in the\r\nmovement as a whole is in operation in some four hundred schools\r\nattended by thirty-six thousand pupils.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more gratifying than the unanimous testimony of the\r\nofficers of the Department to the increasing practical intelligence and\r\nreasonableness of the numerous Committees responsible for the local\r\nadministration of the schemes which the Department has to approve of and\r\nsupervise. The demand for visible money's worth has largely given place\r\nto a genuine desire for schemes having a practical educational value for\r\nthe industry of the district. County Clare is not generally considered\r\nthe most advanced part of Ireland, nor can Kilrush be very far distant\r\nfrom 'the back of Godspeed'; yet even from that storm-battered outpost\r\nof Irish ideas I was memorialised a year ago to induce the County\r\nCouncil to pay less attention to the improvement of cattle and more to\r\nthe technical education of the peasantry.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading of direct aids to agriculture, rural industries, and\r\nsea and inland fisheries, there is much important and useful work which\r\nthe Department has set in motion, partly by the use of its funds and\r\npartly by suggestion and the organisation of local effort. The most\r\nobvious, popular and easily understood schemes were those directed to\r\nthe improvement of live stock. The Department exercised its supervision\r\nand control with the help of advisory committees composed of the best\r\nexperts it could get to volunteer advice upon the various classes of\r\nlive stock. It is unnecessary to give any details of these schemes. The\r\nDepartment profited by the experience of, and received considerable\r\nassistance from the Royal Dublin Society, which had for many years\r\nadministered a Government grant for the improvement of horses and\r\ncattle. The broad principle adopted by the Department was that its\r\nefforts and its available resources should be devoted rather to\r\nimproving the quality, than to increasing the quantity, of the stock in\r\nthe country, the latter function being regarded as belonging to the\r\nregion of private enterprise.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to over-estimate the importance to the country of\r\nhaving a widespread interest aroused and discussion stimulated on\r\nproblems of breeding which affect a trade of vast importance to the\r\neconomic standing of the country--a trade which now reaches in horned\r\ncattle alone an annual export of nearly three quarters of a million\r\nanimals. All manner of practical discussions were set on foot, ranging\r\nfrom the production of the ideal, the general purposes cow, to that\r\ncontroversy which competes, in the virulence with which it is waged,\r\nwith the political, the educational, and the fiscal questions--the\r\nquestion whether the hackney strain will bring a new era of prosperity\r\nto Ireland, or whether it will irretrievably destroy the reputation of\r\nthe Irish hunter. The discussion of these problems has been accompanied\r\nby much practical work which, in due time, cannot fail to produce a\r\nconsiderable improvement upon the breed of different classes of live\r\nstock. In one year over one thousand sires have been selected by the\r\nexperts of the Department for admission to the stock improvement\r\nschemes. Probably an equal number of breeding animals offered for\r\ninspection have been rejected. Many a _cause celèbre_ has not\r\nunnaturally arisen over the decisions of the equestrian tribunal, and\r\nthere have not been wanting threats that the attention of Parliament\r\nshould be called to the gross partiality of the Department which has\r\ncast a reflection upon the form of stallion A or upon the constitutional\r\nsoundness of stallion B. On the whole, as far as I can gather, the best\r\nauthorities in the country are agreed that since the Department has\r\nbeen at work there has been established a higher standard of excellence\r\nin the bucolic mind as regards that vastly important national asset, our\r\nflocks and herds.\r\n\r\nAgain for details I must refer the reader to official documents. There\r\nhe will find as much information as he can digest about the vast variety\r\nof agricultural activities which originate sometimes with the\r\nDepartment's officers or with its _Journal_ and leaflets, the\r\ncirculation of which has no longer to be stimulated from our Statistics\r\nand Intelligence bureau, and sometimes emanate from the local\r\ncommittees, whose growing interest in the work naturally leads to the\r\ndiscovery of fresh needs and hitherto unthought of possibilities of\r\nagricultural and industrial improvement. I may, however, indicate a few\r\nof the subjects which have been gone into even in these years while the\r\nnew Department has been trying so far as it might, without sacrifice of\r\nefficiency and sound economic principle, to keep pace with the feverish\r\nanxiety of a genuinely interested people to get to work upon schemes\r\nwhich they believe to be practical, sound, and of permanent utility.\r\n\r\nA question which has troubled administrators of State aid to every\r\nprogressive agricultural community, and which each country must settle\r\nfor itself, is by what form of object lesson in ordinary agriculture\r\nintelligent local interest can best be aroused We have advocated widely\r\ndiffused small experimental plots, and they have done much good.\r\nProbably the most useful of our crop improvement schemes have been\r\nthose which have demonstrated the profitableness of artificial manures,\r\nthe use of which has been enormously increased. The profits derivable in\r\nmany parts of Ireland from the cultivation of early potatoes has been\r\ndemonstrated in the most convincing manner. To what may be called the\r\nindustrial crops, notably flax and barley, a great deal of time and\r\nthought has been applied and much information disseminated and\r\nillustrated by practical experiments. In many quarters interest has been\r\naroused in the possibilities of profitable tobacco culture. Many\r\nnegative and some positive results have been attained by the Department\r\nin the as yet incomplete experiments upon this crop. Much has been\r\nlearned about the functions of central and local agricultural and small\r\nindustry shows, those occasional aids to the year's work which\r\ndisseminate knowledge and stimulate interest and friendly rivalry among\r\nthe different producers. The reduction in the death-rate among young\r\nstock, due to preventible causes such as white scour and blackleg, is\r\nwell worthy of the attention of those who wish to study the more\r\npractical work of the Department.\r\n\r\nThe branch of the Department's work which deals with the Sea-fisheries\r\ncan only be very briefly touched on. It falls into two main heads which\r\nmay roughly be termed the administrative and the scientific; the latter,\r\nof course, having economic developments as its ultimate object. The\r\nissue of loans to fishermen for the purchase of boats and gear,\r\ncontributing to the cost of fishery slips and piers, circulating\r\ntelegraphic intelligence, the making of by-laws for the regulation of\r\nthe fisheries, the patrolling of the Irish fishing grounds to prevent\r\nillegalities, and the attempts which are being made to develop the\r\nvaluable Irish oyster fishery by the introduction, with modifications\r\nsuited to our own seaboard, of a system of culture comparable to those\r\nwhich are pursued with success in France and Norway, may be mentioned as\r\nfalling under the more directly economic branch of our activities. Irish\r\noysters are already attaining considerable celebrity, owing to the\r\ndistance of our oyster beds from contaminating influences; and it is\r\nhoped that when the Department's experiments are complete the Irish\r\noyster will be made subject to direct control for all its life, until it\r\nis despatched to market. Attention is also being given to the relative\r\nvalue of seed oysters, other than native, for relaying on Irish beds.\r\n\r\nOn the more directly scientific side, the Department has undertaken the\r\nsurvey of the trawling grounds around the coast to obtain an exact\r\nknowledge of the movements of the marketable fish at different times of\r\ntheir life, so that we may be guided in making by-laws and regulations\r\nby a full knowledge of the times and places at which protection is\r\nnecessary. The biological and physical conditions of the western seas\r\nare also being studied in special reference to the mackerel fishery,\r\nwith the object of correlating certain readily observable phenomena with\r\nthe movements of the fish, and so of predicting the probable success of\r\na fishery in a particular season. The routine observations of the\r\nDepartment's fishery cruiser have been so arranged as to synchronise\r\nwith those of other nations, in order to assist the international scheme\r\nof investigation now in progress, wherever its objects and those of the\r\nDepartment are the same. While these various practical projects have\r\nbeen in operation, we have done our best to keep abreast of the times by\r\nsending missions to other countries, consisting of an expert accompanied\r\nby practical Irishmen who would bring home information which was\r\napplicable to the conditions of our own country. The first batch of\r\nitinerant instructors in agriculture, whose training for the important\r\nwork of laying the foundations for our whole scheme of agricultural\r\ninstruction I have referred to, were taken on a continental tour by the\r\nProfessor of Agriculture at the Royal College of Science, in order to\r\ngive special advantages to a portion of our outdoor staff upon the\r\nsuccess of whose work the rate of our progress in agricultural\r\ndevelopment might largely depend. And not only have we in our first\r\nthree years gleaned as much information as possible by sending qualified\r\nIrishmen to study abroad the industries in which we were particularly\r\ninterested, but we also took steps to give the mass of our people at\r\nhome an opportunity of studying these industries for themselves. With\r\nthe somewhat unique experiment carried out for this object, I will\r\nconclude the story of the new Department's activities in its early\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe part we took at the Cork Exhibition of 1902 was well understood in\r\nIreland, but not perhaps elsewhere. We secured a large space both in the\r\nmain Industrial Hall and in the grounds, and gave an illustration not of\r\nwhat Ireland had done, but of what, in our opinion, the country might\r\nachieve in the way of agricultural and industrial development in the\r\nnear future. Exhibiting on the one hand our available resources in the\r\nway of raw material, we gave, on the other hand, demonstrations of a\r\nlarge number of industries in actual operation. These exhibits, imported\r\nwith their workers, machinery and tools, from several European countries\r\nand from Great Britain, all belonged to some class of industry which, in\r\nour belief, was capable of successful development in Ireland. In the\r\nindoor part of the exhibit there was nothing very original, except\r\nperhaps in its close relation to the work of a government department.\r\nBut what attracted by far the greatest interest and attention was a\r\nseries of object lessons in many phases of farm activities, where, in\r\nour opinion, great and immediate improvements might be made. Here were\r\nto be seen varieties of crops under various systems of treatment,\r\ndemonstrations of sheep-dipping, calf-rearing on different foods,\r\nillustrations of the different breeds of fowl and systems of poultry\r\nmanagement, model buildings and gardens for farmer and labourer; while\r\nin separate buildings the drying and pressing of fruit and vegetables,\r\nthe manufacture of butter and cheese, and a very comprehensive forestry\r\nexhibit enabled our visitors to combine profitable suggestion with, if I\r\nmay judge from my frequent opportunities of observing the sightseers in\r\nwhom I was particularly interested, the keenest enjoyment.\r\n\r\nWe kept at the Exhibition, for six months, a staff of competent experts,\r\nwhose instructions were to give to all-comers this simple lesson. They\r\nwere to bring home to our people that, here in Ireland before their very\r\neyes, there were industries being carried on by foreigners, by\r\nEnglishmen, by Scotchmen, and in some instances by Irishmen, but in all\r\ncases by men and women who had no advantage over our workers except that\r\nthey had the technical training which it was the desire of the\r\nDepartment to give to the workers of Ireland. The officials of the\r\nDepartment entered into the spirit of this scheme enthusiastically and\r\ncheerfully, some of them, in addition to their ordinary work, turning\r\nthe office into a tourist agency for these busy months. With the\r\ngenerous help of the railway companies they organised parties of\r\nfarmers, artisans, school teachers, members of the statutory committees,\r\nand, in fact, of all to whom it was of importance to give this object\r\nlesson upon the relations between practical education and the promotion\r\nof industry. Nearly 100,000 persons were thus moved to Cork and back\r\nbefore the Exhibition closed--an achievement largely due to the\r\nassistance given by the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society and the\r\nclergy throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThis experiment, both in its conception and in its results, was perhaps\r\nunique. There were not wanting critics of the new Department who stood\r\naghast at so large an expenditure upon temporary edifices and a passing\r\nshow; but those who are in touch with its educational work know that\r\nthis novel application of State assistance fulfilled its purpose. It\r\nhelped substantially to generate a belief in, and stimulate a demand\r\nfor, technical instruction which it will take us many years adequately\r\nto supply.\r\n\r\nAn American visitor who, as I afterwards learned, takes an active part\r\nin the discussion of the rural problems of his own country, disembarked\r\nat Queenstown in order to 'take in' the Cork Exhibition. In his rush\r\nthrough Dublin he 'took in' the Department and the writer. 'Mr.\r\nVice-President,' he said, before the hand-shaking was completed, 'I have\r\nvisited all the great Expositions held in my time. I have been to the\r\nCork Exposition. I often saw more things, but never more ideas.'\r\n\r\nWith this characteristically rapid appreciation of a movement which\r\nseeks to turn Irish thought to action, my strange visitor vanished as\r\nsuddenly as he came.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThose whose sympathy with Ireland has induced them to persevere through\r\nthe mass of details with which this story of small beginnings is pieced\r\ntogether may wonder why the bearing of hopeful efforts for bringing\r\nprosperity and contentment to Ireland upon the mental attitude of\r\nmillions of Irishmen scattered throughout the British Empire and the\r\nUnited States, and so upon the lives of the countries in which they have\r\nmade their homes, is apparently ignored. I fully recognise the vast\r\nimportance of the subject. A book dealing comprehensively with the\r\nactual and potential influence of Irish intellect upon English politics\r\nat home, and upon the politics of the United States, a carefully\r\nreasoned estimate of the part which Irish intellect is qualified, and\r\nwhich I firmly believe it is destined, to play wherever the civilisation\r\nof the world is to be under the control of the English-speaking\r\npeoples--more especially where these peoples govern races which speak\r\nother tongues and see through other eyes--a clear and striking\r\nexposition of the true relation between the small affairs of the small\r\nisland and that greater Ireland which takes its inspiration from the\r\nsorrows, the passions, the endeavours, and the hopes of those who stick\r\nto the old home--such a book would possess a deep human interest, and\r\nwould make a high and wide appeal. Nevertheless, I feel that at the\r\npresent time the most urgent need, from every point of view on which I\r\nhave touched, is to focus the thought available for the Irish Question\r\nupon the definite work of a reconstruction of Irish life.\r\n\r\nSuch is the purpose of this book. I do not wish to attach any\r\nexaggerated importance to the scheme of social and economic reform of\r\nwhich I have attempted to give a faithful account; nor is it in their\r\npractical achievement, be it great or small, that the initiators and\r\norganisers of the new movement take most pride. What these Irishmen are\r\nproud of is the manner in which the people have responded to their\r\nefforts to bring Irish sentiment into an intimate and helpful relation\r\nwith Irish economic problems. They had to reckon with that greatest of\r\nhindrances to the spirit of enterprise, a rooted belief in the\r\npotentiality of government to bring material prosperity to our doors. As\r\nI have pointed out, the practical demonstration which Ireland had\r\nreceived of the power of government to inflict lasting economic injury\r\ngave rise to this belief; and I have noted the present influences to\r\nwhich it seems to owe its continuance until to-day. I believe that, if\r\nany enduring interest attaches to the story which I have told, it will\r\nconsist in the successive steps by which this initial difficulty has\r\nbeen overcome.\r\n\r\nLet me summarise in a few words what has been, so far, actually\r\naccomplished. Those who did the work of which I have written first\r\nlaunched upon Irish life a scheme of organised self-help which, perhaps\r\nmore by good luck than design, proved to be in accordance with the\r\ninherited instincts of the people, and, therefore, moved them to action.\r\nNext they called for, and in due season obtained, a department of\r\ngovernment with adequate powers and means to aid in developing the\r\nresources of the country, so far as this end could be attained without\r\ntransgressing the limits of beneficial State interference with the\r\nbusiness of the people. In its constitution this department was so\r\nlinked with the representative institutions of the country that the\r\npeople soon began to feel that they largely controlled its policy and\r\nwere responsible for its success. Meanwhile, the progress of economic\r\nthought in the country had made such rapid strides that, in the\r\nadministration of State assistance, the principle of self-help could be\r\nrigidly insisted upon and was willingly submitted to. The result is that\r\na situation has been created which is as gratifying as it may appear to\r\nbe paradoxical. Within the scope and sphere of the movement the Irish\r\npeople are now, without any sacrifice of industrial character, combining\r\nreliance upon government with reliance upon themselves.\r\n\r\nThat a movement thus conceived should so rapidly have overcome its\r\ninitial difficulties and should, I might almost add, have passed beyond\r\nthe experimental stage, will suggest to any thoughtful reader that above\r\nand beyond the removal by legislation of obstacles to progress--and much\r\nhas been accomplished in this way of recent years--there must have been\r\nnew, positive influences at work upon the national mind. These will be\r\nfound in the growing recognition of the fact that the path of progress\r\nlies along distinctively Irish lines, and that otherwise it will not be\r\ntrodden by the Irish people. Much good in the same direction has been\r\ndone, too, by the generous and authoritative admission by England that\r\nthe future development of Ireland should be assisted and promoted 'with\r\na full and constant regard to the special traditions of the\r\ncountry.'[52] But after all, while these concessions to Irish\r\nsentiment, vitally important though they be, may speed us on our road to\r\nnational regeneration, they will not take us far. It remains for us\r\nIrishmen to realise--and the chief value of all the work I have\r\ndescribed consists in the degree in which it forces us to realise--the\r\nresponsibility which now rests with ourselves. We have been too long a\r\nprey to that deep delusion, which, because the ills of the country we\r\nlove were in past days largely caused from without, bids us look to the\r\nsame source for their cure. The true remedies are to be sought\r\nelsewhere; for, however disastrous may have been the past, the injury\r\nwas moral rather than material, and the opportunity has now arrived for\r\nthe patient building up again of Irish character in those qualities\r\nwhich win in the modern struggle for existence. The field for that great\r\nwork is clear of at least the worst of its many historic encumbrances.\r\nIreland must be re-created from within. The main work must be done in\r\nIreland, and the centre of interest must be Ireland. When Irishmen\r\nrealise this truth, the splendid human power of their country, so much\r\nof which now runs idly or disastrously to waste, will be utilised; and\r\nwe may then look with confidence for the foundation of a fabric of Irish\r\nprosperity, framed in constructive thought, and laid enduringly in human\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[48] Pages 38, 39.\r\n\r\n[49] It must be borne in mind that the Department is not officially\r\nconcerned with the question of the economic distribution of land\r\nreferred to on pp. 46-49.\r\n\r\n[50] For a full description of the Department's scheme of agricultural\r\neducation I may refer to a _Memorandum on Agricultural Education in\r\nIreland,_ written by the author and published by the Department, July,\r\n1901.\r\n\r\n[51] See _ante_, pp. 236-238.\r\n\r\n[52] Speech of the Lord Lieutenant to the Incorporated Law Society,\r\nNovember 20th, 1902.
