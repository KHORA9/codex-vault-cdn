O.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nMy book, _Young India_, was written during the first year of the war and\r\nwas finally revised and sent to the press before the war was two years\r\nold. It concluded with the following observation:\r\n\r\n    \"The Indians are a chivalrous people; they will not disturb\r\n    England as long as she is engaged with Germany. The struggle after\r\n    the war might, however, be even more bitter and sustained.\"\r\n\r\nThe events that have happened since have amply justified the above\r\nconclusion. India not only refrained from disturbing England while she\r\nwas engaged in war with Germany, but actively helped in defeating\r\nGermany and winning the war. She raised an army of over a million\r\ncombatants and supplied a large number of war workers, and made huge\r\ncontributions in money and materials. She denied herself the necessities\r\nof life in order to feed and equip the armies in the field though within\r\nthe last months of the war, when scarcity and epidemic overtook her, she\r\nlost six millions of her sons and daughters from one disease\r\nalone--influenza. This was more than chivalry. This was self-effacement\r\nin the interests of an Empire which, in the past, had treated her\r\nchildren as helots. How much of this effort was voluntary and how much\r\nof it was forced it is difficult to appraise. Great Britain, however,\r\nhas unequivocally accepted it as voluntary and has attributed it to\r\nIndia's satisfaction with her rule. That India was not satisfied with\r\nher rule she has spared no pains to impress upon the British people as\r\nwell as the rest of the world. Reading between the lines of the report\r\nof the Secretary of State for India and the Viceroy has established the\r\nfact of that dissatisfaction beyond the possibility of doubt, but if any\r\ndoubt still remained it has been dispelled by the writings and\r\nutterances of her representative spokesman in India, in Great Britain\r\nand abroad. The prince and the peasant, the landlord and the ryot, the\r\nprofessor and the student, the politician and the layman--all have\r\nspoken. They differ in their estimates of the \"blessings\" of British\r\nrule, they differ in the manner of their profession of loyalty to the\r\nBritish Empire, they sometimes differ in shaping their schemes for the\r\nfuture Government of India but they are all agreed:\r\n\r\n(1) That the present constitution of the Government of India is\r\nviciously autocratic, bureaucratic, antiquated and unsatisfying.\r\n\r\n(2) That India has, in the past, been governed more in the interests of,\r\nand by the British merchant and the British aristocrat than in the\r\ninterests of her own peoples.\r\n\r\n(3) That the neglect of India's education and industries has been\r\nculpably tragic and\r\n\r\n(4) That the only real and effectual remedy is to introduce an element\r\nof responsibility in the Government of India.\r\n\r\nIn the report of the Secretary of State and the Viceroy, so often quoted\r\nand referred to in these pages, the truth of (1), (3), and (4) is\r\nsubstantially admitted and point (2) indirectly conceded. In the\r\nfollowing pages an attempt is made to prove this by extracts from the\r\nreport itself. Ever since the report was published in July, 1918, India\r\nhas been in a state of ferment,--a ferment of enthusiasm and criticism,\r\nof hope and disappointment. While the country has freely acknowledged\r\nthe unique value of the report, the politicians have differed in their\r\nestimates of the value of the scheme embodied therein. Yet there is a\r\ncomplete unanimity on one point, that nothing _less_ than what is\r\nplanned in the report will be accepted, even as the first step towards\r\neventual complete responsible Government. This is the minimum. Even the\r\nultra-moderates have expressed themselves quite strongly on that point.\r\nSpeaking at the Conference of the Moderates held at Bombay on November\r\n1, 1918, the President, Mr. Surendranath Banerjea, is reported to have\r\nsaid: \"our creed is co-operation with the Government wherever\r\npracticable, and opposition to its policy and measures when the supreme\r\ninterests of the mother-land require it.... I have a word to say ... to\r\nthe British Government. I have a warning note to sound.... If the\r\nenactment of the Reform proposals is unduly postponed, if they are\r\nwhittled down _in any way_ ... there will be grave public discontent and\r\nagitation.\" A little further in the same speech he asked if \"by the\r\nunwisdom of our rulers\" India was \"to be converted into a greater\r\nIreland.\" In less than six months from the date of this pronouncement,\r\nthe rulers of India gave ample proof of their \"unwisdom\" by actually\r\nconverting India into a \"greater Ireland\" and in establishing the\r\nabsolute correctness of the prognostication made by the present writer\r\nin the concluding sentence of his book _Young India_. The manifesto of\r\nthe Moderate Party issued over the signatures of the Moderate leaders\r\nall over the country contained the following warning: \"We must equally\r\nprotest against every attempt, by whomever made and in whatever manner,\r\nat any mutilation of the Montagu-Chelmsford proposals. We are\r\nconstrained to utter a grave warning against the inevitable disastrous\r\neffects of such a grievous mistake on the future relations of the\r\nBritish Government and the Indian people which will result in discontent\r\nand agitation followed by repression on the one side and suffering on\r\nthe other side.\" Little did they know when they uttered the warning that\r\nrepression would come even before the Reform Scheme was discussed in\r\nParliament and \"mutilated\" there. British rule in Ireland has been for\r\nthe last twenty years a wearisome record of mixed concessions and\r\ncoercions. Every time a concession was made it was either preceded or\r\naccompanied by strong doses of coercion. One would have thought that\r\nBritish statesmen were wiser by their experience of Ireland, but it\r\nseems that they have learnt nothing and that they have no intention of\r\ndoing in India anything different from what they have been doing in\r\nIreland. The history of British statesmanship in relation to Irish\r\naffairs is repeating itself almost item by item in India.\r\n\r\nLord Morley's reforms were both preceded and followed by strong measures\r\nof repression and suppression. As if to prove that British statesmanship\r\ncan never in this respect set aside precedent even for once, Mr.\r\nMontagu's proposals have been followed by a measure of coercion unique\r\neven for India. Mr. Montagu's proposals for the reconstruction of\r\nGovernment in India are yet in the air. They are being criticised and\r\nexamined minutely by numerous British agencies both in India and in\r\nEngland as to how and in what respects they can be made innocuous.\r\nCertain other reforms promised by the report, such as the scheme for\r\nLocal Self Government and the policy in relation to the Arms Act, have\r\nalready been disposed of in the usual masterly way of giving with one\r\nhand and taking back with the other. Similarly the \"great\" scheme of\r\nopening the commissioned ranks of the Army to the native Indians has\r\npractically (for the present at least) ended in fiasco. But the policy\r\nunderlying the Rowlatt laws has surpassed all. In the chapters of this\r\nbook dealing with the Revolutionary movement the reader will find a\r\ngenesis of the Rowlatt laws of coercion.\r\n\r\nOn the sixteenth of January in the _Gazette of India_ was published a\r\ndraft of two bills that were proposed to be brought before the\r\nLegislative Council of India (which has a standing majority of\r\nGovernment officials). These bills were to give effect to the\r\nrecommendations of the committee presided over by Mr. Justice Rowlatt of\r\nthe High Court of England, for the prevention, detection and punishment\r\nof sedition in India. Their introduction into the Legislative Council\r\nwas at once protested against by all classes of Indians with a unanimity\r\nnever before witnessed in the history of India. All sections of the\r\ngreat Indian population from the Prince to the peasant, including all\r\nraces, religions, sects, castes, creeds and professions joined in the\r\nprotest. Hindus, Mohammedans, Indian Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists,\r\nParsees--all stood up, to a man, to oppose the measure. All the\r\npolitical parties, Conservatives, Liberals, Moderates and Extremists\r\nexpressed themselves against it. The measure was opposed by all the\r\nnon-official Indian members of the Legislative Council. All methods of\r\nagitation were resorted to in order to make the opinion of the country\r\nknown to the Government and to warn the latter against the danger of\r\ndefying the united will of the people. The press, the pulpit and the\r\nplatform all joined in denouncing the measures, meetings of protest were\r\nheld in all parts of the country and resolutions wired to the\r\nGovernment. A few days before the final meeting at which these bills\r\nwere to be passed into law a number of prominent citizens, male and\r\nfemale, pledged themselves to passive resistance in case the measures\r\nwere enacted. The passive resistance movement was inaugurated and led by\r\nMr. M. K. Gandhi, a man of saintly character, universally respected and\r\nrevered in India, the same who stood for the Government during the war\r\nand rendered material help in recruiting soldiers, raising loans and\r\nprocuring other help for its prosecution. The following is the text of\r\nthe pledge that was signed by hundreds and thousands of Indians\r\nbelonging to all races and religions and hailing from all parts of the\r\ncontinent:\r\n\r\n    \"Being conscientiously of opinion that the bills known as the\r\n    Indian Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill No. 1 of 1919 and No. 2 of\r\n    1919 are unjust, subversive of the principle of liberty and\r\n    justice and destructive of the elementary rights of individuals on\r\n    which the safety of the community as a whole and the State itself\r\n    is based, we solemnly affirm that, in the event of these bills\r\n    becoming law, we shall refuse civilly to obey these laws and such\r\n    other laws as a committee to be hereafter appointed may think fit\r\n    and we further affirm that in this struggle we will faithfully\r\n    follow truth and refrain from violence of life, person or\r\n    property.\"\r\n\r\nThe passive resistance movement was not approved by the country as a\r\nwhole, and influential voices were raised against it even in its early\r\nstages but the fact that Mr. Gandhi had taken the responsibility of\r\ninitiating and leading it and that many women had signed the pledge\r\nshould have opened the eyes of the Government as to the intensity of the\r\nfeeling behind it. Besides this threat of passive resistance the Indian\r\nmembers of the Council showed their solid opposition to the measure by\r\nusing all the historic obstructive methods so well known to the student\r\nof Parliamentary debates in the House of Commons as associated with the\r\nIrish Nationalist party under the leadership of Parnell. The debates in\r\nthe Legislative Council of India do not ordinarily last for more than\r\none day, consisting, at the most, of eight hours. The debate on this\r\nbill lasted for three days; one sitting lasted \"from 11 o'clock in the\r\nmorning ... until nearly half past one the following day with\r\nadjournments for luncheon and dinner.\" The officials were determined to\r\npass the bill at that sitting and so they refused to rise until the\r\namendments on the agenda had been disposed of and the bill passed into\r\nlaw. The non-officials proposed no less than 160 amendments but by the\r\napplication of closure methods they were all disposed of in three days\r\nand the bill passed (on the 18th of March). The Government made a few\r\nminor concessions but on the whole the bill remained as it had been\r\ndrafted, a monument of Governmental shortsightedness and stupidity. The\r\nconsideration of the other bill was postponed. As soon as the news\r\nreached Bombay that the first bill had become law \"the market was closed\r\nas a protest\" and \"posters in English and the vernacular, were displayed\r\nthroughout the city urging the non-payment of taxes and asking the\r\npeople to resist the order of a tyrannical Government.\" (London _Times_,\r\nApril 2.) Similar manifestations of anger were made throughout the\r\ncountry and the movement for passive resistance was definitely\r\ninaugurated. It spread like wild fire. Thousands joined it and the\r\nrelations between the people and the Government became very strained.\r\nHowever, no violence was resorted to, nor was any harm done to life and\r\nproperty. Several members of the Legislative Council resigned their\r\noffices. One of them a Mohammedan leader, wrote the following letter to\r\nHis Excellency the Viceroy:\r\n\r\n    \"Your Excellency, the passing of the Rowlatt Bill by the\r\n    Government of India and the assent given to it by your Excellency\r\n    as Governor-General against the will of the people has severely\r\n    shaken the trust reposed by them in British justice. Further, it\r\n    has clearly demonstrated the constitution of the Imperial\r\n    Legislative Council which is a legislature but in name, a machine\r\n    propelled by a foreign executive. Neither the unanimous opinion of\r\n    the non-official Indian members, nor the entire public opinion and\r\n    feeling outside has met with the least respect. The Government of\r\n    India and your Excellency, however, have thought it fit to place\r\n    on the statute-book a measure admittedly obnoxious and decidedly\r\n    coercive at a time of peace, thereby substituting executive for\r\n    judicial discretion. Besides, by passing this Bill, your\r\n    Excellency's Government have actively negatived every argument\r\n    they advanced but a year ago when they appealed to India for help\r\n    at the War Conference, and have ruthlessly trampled upon the\r\n    principles for which Great Britain avowedly fought the war.\r\n\r\n    \"The fundamental principles of justice have been uprooted and the\r\n    constitutional rights of the people have been violated, at a time\r\n    when there is no real danger to the state, by an overfearful and\r\n    incompetent bureaucracy which is neither responsible to the\r\n    people, nor in touch with real public opinion and their whole plea\r\n    is that 'powers when they are assumed will not be abused.'\r\n\r\n    \"I, therefore, as a protest against the passing of the Bill and\r\n    the manner in which it was passed, tender my resignation as a\r\n    member of the Imperial Legislative Council, for I feel that, under\r\n    the prevailing conditions, I can be of no use to my people in the\r\n    Council, nor, consistently with one's self respect, is coöperation\r\n    possible with a Government that shows such utter disregard for the\r\n    opinion of the representatives of the people in the Council\r\n    Chamber and the feelings and sentiments of the people outside.\r\n\r\n    \"In my opinion, a Government that passes or sanctions such law in\r\n    times of peace forfeits its claim to be called a civilized\r\n    Government and I still hope that the Secretary of State for India,\r\n    Mr. Montagu, will advise his Majesty to signify his disallowance\r\n    to this Black Act.\r\n\r\n                                              \"Yours truly,\r\n                                                       \"M. A. Jinnah.\"\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the passive resistance movement declared 30th March as\r\n\"the National protest day.\" The protest was to be made by all the\r\ntraditional methods known to India for ages, viz., by fasting, stopping\r\nbusiness, praying, and meeting in congregations in their respective\r\nplaces of worship. The only Western method contemplated was passing\r\nresolutions and sending telegrams to the authorities in India and\r\nEngland. The 30th of March was thus observed as a national protest day\r\nthroughout India and there was only one clash between the people and the\r\nGovernment, viz., at Delhi, the national capital.\r\n\r\nDelhi has been the national capital of India from times immemorial. It\r\nwas the chief capital city of the Moguls. It has a mixed population of\r\nHindus and Mohammedans, almost evenly divided. The European population\r\nthere is not very large. There is a British garrison stationed in the\r\nMogul fort. Besides being the capital of British India, Delhi is a very\r\nimportant trade center and the terminus of several railway lines. All\r\nbusiness was stopped, shops closed and the city gave an appearance of a\r\ngeneral strike. A mass meeting attended by 40,000 people, according to\r\nBritish estimates, and presided over by a religious ascetic, passed\r\nresolutions of protest and cabled them to the Secretary of State for\r\nIndia in London. It was at Delhi and on this day as already stated that\r\nthe first clash occurred between the authorities and the people. It is\r\nimmaterial how it came about but it may be noted that rifles and machine\r\nguns were freely used in dispersing the mobs at the railway station and\r\nother places. According to official estimates fourteen persons were\r\nkilled and about sixty wounded. The non-official estimates give larger\r\nfigures. Evidently nothing serious happened between March 30th and April\r\n6th which last was observed as a day of mourning throughout British\r\nIndia from Peshawar to Cape Comorin and from Calcutta to Karachi and\r\nBombay. People held meetings, made speeches, marched in processions,\r\ntook pledges of passive resistance, closed shops, suspended business,\r\nbathed in the sea, joined in prayer and fasted. No violence of any kind\r\nwas reported. In the words of a correspondent of the London _Times_,\r\n\"the distinguishing feature of many of these demonstrations [meaning\r\nthereby passive resistance demonstrations] made on the 6th of April,\r\nspecially at Delhi, Agra, Bombay and Calcutta, is the Hindu and Moslem\r\nfraternization, Hindus being freely admitted to the mosques, on\r\noccasions occupying the Mihrab (the niche indicating the direction of\r\nMecca).\" In a message dated April 7th the same correspondent cabled \"an\r\nunprecedented event in the shape of a joint Moslem-Hindu service at the\r\nfamous Juma Masjed at Delhi, at which a Hindu[1] delivered a sermon.\"\r\nThe Juma Masjed is one of the jewels of Mogul architecture and probably\r\nthe biggest mosque in India.\r\n\r\nOn April 9th Sir Michael O'Dwyer, the Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab,\r\ndwelt with pride on the fact that the province ruled by him with an iron\r\nhand for the last five years \"had raised 360,000 combatants during the\r\nwar.\" \"Dealing with the political situation he declared that the\r\nGovernment of the province was determined that public order which was\r\nmaintained during the war, should not be disturbed during peace. Action\r\nhad therefore been taken under the Defence Act against certain\r\nindividuals who were openly endeavoring to arouse public feeling against\r\nthe Government.\" It was this action, viz., the summary arrest of\r\nleaders at Amritsar and the order of prohibition against Mr. Gandhi's\r\ncontemplated visit to the Punjab, that set fire to the accumulated\r\nmagazine. It exasperated the people and in a moment of despair the\r\nintense strain of the last few weeks found relief in attacks on\r\nGovernment buildings and stray persons of European extraction. What\r\nactually happened in different places no one can definitely tell just at\r\nthis stage but it is clear that at places so widely distant as Amritsar\r\nand Lahore in the Punjab and Viramgam in the Gujerat (Western\r\nPresidency) railway stations, telegraph offices and some other public\r\nbuildings were burned, railway traffic interrupted, tram cars stopped\r\nand some Europeans killed and attacked. At Amritsar three banks were\r\nburnt down and their managers killed. Telegraphing on April 15th and\r\nagain on the 16th of April, the correspondent of the London _Times_\r\nremarked that \"the Punjab continued to be the principal seat of trouble\"\r\nwhich was probably due to the extremely brutal methods which the Punjab\r\nGovernment had followed in repressing and suppressing not only the\r\npresent 'riots' but also all kinds of political activity in the\r\npreceding six years. It appears that in about a week's time almost the\r\nwhole province was ablaze. The Government used machine guns in\r\ndispersing meetings, showered bombs from aeroplanes and declared martial\r\nlaw in several towns, extended the seditious meetings prevention Act and\r\nother emergency laws in districts, marched flying military columns from\r\none end to the other, accompanied by travelling courts martial to try\r\nand punish on the spot all arrested for offences committed in connection\r\nwith the passive resistence movement. Leaders were arrested and\r\ndeported without trial of any kind; papers were suppressed and all kinds\r\nof demonstrations prohibited.\r\n\r\nAmong the leaders arrested are the names of some of the most\r\nconservative and moderate of the Punjab public men--men whose whole life\r\nis opposed to extremism of any kind. Those men were subjected to various\r\nindignities, handcuffed and marched to jail. They have been held in\r\nordinary prison cells and all comforts have been denied to them as if\r\nthey were criminals. Counsel engaged for them from outside the Province\r\nhave been refused admission into the Province. Machine guns and\r\naeroplanes have been used in dispersing unarmed mobs and crowds were\r\nfired at in many places. At Lahore the General Officer Commanding gave\r\nnotice \"that unless all the shops were re-opened within 48 hours all\r\ngoods in the shops not opened will be sold by public auction.\" As to the\r\ncauses of the upheaval, the Anglo-Indian view is contained in a\r\ntelegraphic message to the London _Times_ bearing date April 20th. Below\r\nwe give a verbatim copy of this message:\r\n\r\n    CAUSES OF THE UPHEAVAL.\r\n\r\n    \"Bombay, April 20.--We have passed through the most anxious ten\r\n    days that India has known for half a century. We have further\r\n    anxious days in store, for although in Bombay conditions are\r\n    improving and Mr. Gandhi has publicly abandoned the passive\r\n    resistance movement, while men of weight are rallying to the\r\n    support of the Government, the situation in Northern India is\r\n    disquieting.\r\n\r\n    \"We may pause to enquire into this widespread manifestation of\r\n    violence. How came it that passive resistance to the Rowlatt\r\n    Act--never likely to be applied to the greater part of India,\r\n    especially to Bombay, and nominally confined to the sale of\r\n    proscribed literature of doubtful legality, which was\r\n    waning--suddenly flamed into riot, arson, and murder at Delhi,\r\n    Ahmedabad, Viramgam, Amritsar, and other parts of the Punjab on\r\n    the prevention of Mr. Gandhi's entry into Delhi? All day on April\r\n    11 Bombay stood on the brink of a bloody riot, averted only by the\r\n    Governor, Sir George Lloyd's prudent statesmanship and the great\r\n    restraint of the police and military in face of grave provocation.\r\n\r\n    \"The movement seems to have been twofold. In part it was the\r\n    expression of the prevailing ferment. India is no less affected\r\n    than other parts of the world by the social and intellectual\r\n    revolution of the war, by expectations based on the destruction of\r\n    German materialism and by ambitions for fuller partnership in the\r\n    British Empire.\r\n\r\n    PROFITEERING AND TRICKERY.\r\n\r\n    \"The disruptive effect of these ideals is accentuated by\r\n    prevailing conditions. The prices of food are exceedingly high,\r\n    supplies are scanty, while efforts to control prices are hampered\r\n    by the profiteering and trade trickery unfortunately never absent\r\n    from this country. [As if it was absent from other countries.]\r\n\r\n    \"India having been swept bare of foodstuffs, to meet the\r\n    exigencies of the war, the people feel that the home Government is\r\n    lukewarm in releasing supplies from outside, and resent\r\n    particularly that the Shipping Controller is maintaining high\r\n    freights on fat and rice from Burma. These severe sufferings are\r\n    superimposed on the devastating influenza and cholera epidemics.\r\n    So much for the social and economic situation.\r\n\r\n    \"Then the activities of the Indo-British Association created grave\r\n    doubts whether Parliament will deal fairly with India when the\r\n    reform scheme is considered. The Rowlatt Act was precipitated into\r\n    this surcharged atmosphere.\r\n\r\n    \"The Act was wickedly perverted by the Extremists until among the\r\n    common people it became the general belief that it gave plenary\r\n    powers to a police which was feared and distrusted. Among educated\r\n    people, few of whom studied the report or the Act, it was bitterly\r\n    resented as a badge of India's subjection after loyal\r\n    participation in the war, at a time when the strongest feeling in\r\n    the country was craving for its self-respect in the eyes of the\r\n    nations. Further, it was regarded as prejudicing the cause of\r\n    political reform.\r\n\r\n    \"Another powerful contributory cause was the ferment amongst the\r\n    Moslem community. Everywhere the Moslems believe that the Peace\r\n    Conference is bent on the destruction of Islam. There is no\r\n    confidence in British protection after our declared policy in\r\n    regard to Turkey and the undoing of the settled fact in Eastern\r\n    Bengal in 1911.\r\n\r\n    \"This feeling is the more dangerous because it is inchoate. Moslem\r\n    officers returned from Palestine and Arabia, and acquainted with\r\n    the realities of Turkish rule, have expressed astonishment at the\r\n    strength of this feeling among their co-religionists here.\r\n    Mohamedans have been foremost in the work of riot and destruction\r\n    in Ahmedabad and Delhi, and the lower elements were ripe for\r\n    trouble in Bombay. I am unable to say how far this ferment\r\n    affected the outbreaks in the Punjab.\r\n\r\n    \"This seething Moslem unrest is the most menacing feature of\r\n    Indian politics to-day. It explains the unprecedented admission of\r\n    Hindus to the Mosques of Delhi and Aligarh....\r\n\r\n    REVOLUTIONARY INSPIRATION\r\n\r\n    \"So much for the general situation. In Northern India the\r\n    outbreaks were nakedly revolutionary. They are unconnected with\r\n    the Rowlatt Act or with passive resistance, which probably\r\n    precipitated a movement long concerted. There is abundant evidence\r\n    of the organized revolutionary character of the disturbances in\r\n    the systematic attacks on railways, telegraphs, and all means of\r\n    communication, and its definitely anti-British character is\r\n    apparent from the efforts to plunge the railways into a general\r\n    strike.\r\n\r\n    \"There are signs of the inter-connection of the Punjab\r\n    revolutionaries with the Bombay revolutionaries who organized\r\n    attacks on communications at Ahmedabad and Viramgam, derailed\r\n    trains, cut telegraphs, and sent rowdies from Kaira to take part\r\n    in the work of destruction. There is evidence also of some outside\r\n    inspiration, but whether Bolshevist or otherwise is obscure.\r\n\r\n    \"Whilst in the Punjab the soil was fruitful, owing to economic\r\n    conditions, the ravages of influenza, and the pressure of last\r\n    year's recruiting campaign, the revolutionary origin of the\r\n    disturbances is unquestioned....\"\r\n\r\nAs usual the message is a mixture of truth and imagination. At most it\r\nis a partisan view. Be the causes what they may, the events in our\r\njudgment amply justify the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n(_a_) That India is politically united in demanding a far reaching\r\nmeasure of self-determination.\r\n\r\n(_b_) That she will not be satisfied with paltry measures of political\r\nreform which do not give her power to shape her fiscal policy in her own\r\ninterests, independent of control from London.\r\n\r\n(_c_) That it is useless to further harp on the \"cleavages\" of race,\r\nreligion and language, in dealing with the problem of India.\r\n\r\n(_d_) That the country is no longer prepared to let measures of coercion\r\npass and take effect without making their protest and dislike known to\r\nthe authorities in a manner, the significance of which may not be open\r\nto misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThe Indian members of the Legislative Council while opposing the Rowlatt\r\nBills spoke in sufficiently clear and strong language of the grave\r\nsituation the Government was creating by its ill-considered policy. They\r\nknew their people. The bureaucracy evidently dismissed it as bluff or,\r\nif it knew what was likely to happen, encouraged it in the hope that the\r\noutbreak might justify their opposition to, and dislike of, the\r\nMontagu-Chelmsford scheme. In doing that they have had to hatch the eggs\r\nthey themselves laid. These events have, besides, proved (_a_) that the\r\nlead of the country has passed from the hands of the so called \"natural\r\nleaders,\" the aristocracy of land, money and birth; (_b_) that even the\r\nmoderate leaders have considerably lost in prestige and influence; (_c_)\r\nthat the lead has definitely passed into hands that openly and frankly\r\nstand for self-determination and self-government within the Empire and\r\nare prepared for _any sacrifice_ to achieve that end; (_d_) that the old\r\nmethods of governing India must now be discarded once for all and the\r\ncharge of provinces taken away from sun-dried bureaucrats of the type of\r\nSir Michael O'Dwyer and Sir Reginald Craddock.\r\n\r\nThe bloodshed in the Punjab, which outdid all other Provinces in sending\r\nhelp during the war both in men and money, pointed to the administration\r\nor mal-administration of Sir Michael O'Dwyer as responsible for the\r\nnature and intensity of the outbreak. If ever there was a British ruler\r\nof India who deserved impeachment it is Sir Michael O'Dwyer. He was not\r\nonly a tyrant and a snob of the worst order but he was incompetent also.\r\nOne of the two things must have happened: Either he was out of touch\r\nwith public feeling in the province or he deliberately provoked this\r\ndisaster by a policy of strength. In either case he deserves to be\r\npublicly impeached and condemned for incompetence or brutality or\r\npossibly for both.\r\n\r\nThe following Summary of the orders passed by the officer commanding\r\nshows the nature of the martial law administered in the \"most loyal\"\r\nprovince in India, a province which has so far been considered to be the\r\nright arm of British Ráj in India.\r\n\r\nI have italicised some words and sentences for special attention. The\r\nreader I hope will note the exceptions in favor of the Europeans and the\r\nIndian servants in the employ of the Europeans and also the\r\nreasonableness of the other orders, threatening punishment upon the\r\nowners of certain properties and requiring \"all students,\" and all male\r\npersons belonging to private Colleges in Lahore to attend four times a\r\nday at a particular place for roll call. Order No. 14 is a gem of great\r\nbrilliance.\r\n\r\nI have omitted order No. 6 as unimportant. Orders from 8 to 12 inclusive\r\nare not available. What has been given above, however, is quite\r\nsufficient to show the nature of the martial law that has been applied\r\nto the Punjab, after five years of unquestioned and unrivalled loyalty\r\nto the British Empire, in the period of greatest danger that had\r\novertaken it. Such is the reward of \"loyalty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    NO. 1\r\n\r\n    Whereas the Government of India has for good reasons proclaimed\r\n    Martial Law in the districts of Lahore and Amritsar; and\r\n\r\n    Whereas superior military authority has appointed me to command\r\n    troops and administer Martial Law in a portion of the Lahore\r\n    district, ... and whereas Martial Law may be briefly described as\r\n    the will of the Military Commander in enforcing law, order and\r\n    public safety:\r\n\r\n    I make known to all concerned that until further orders by me the\r\n    following will be strictly carried out:\r\n\r\n    1. At 20·00 hours (8 o'clock) each evening a gun will be fired\r\n    from the Fort, and from that signal till 05·00 hours (5 o'clock)\r\n    on the following morning no person _other than a European_ or a\r\n    person in possession of a military permit signed by me or on my\r\n    behalf will be permitted to leave his or her house or compound or\r\n    the building in which he or she may be at 20 hours. During these\r\n    prohibited hours no person other than those excepted above will be\r\n    permitted to use the streets or roads, and any person found\r\n    disobeying this order will be arrested, and if any attempt is made\r\n    to evade or resist that person will be liable to be shot.\r\n\r\n    This and all other orders which from time to time I may deem\r\n    necessary to make will be issued on my behalf from the water-works\r\n    station in the city, whither every ward will keep at least four\r\n    representatives from 6 A.M., till 17·00 hours (5 P.M.) daily to\r\n    learn what orders, if any, are issued and to convey such orders to\r\n    the inhabitants of their respective wards. _The onus of\r\n    ascertaining the orders issued by me will rest on the people\r\n    through their representatives._\r\n\r\n    2. Loyal and law-abiding persons have nothing to fear from the\r\n    exercise of Martial Law.\r\n\r\n    3. In order to protect the lives of his Majesty's soldiers and\r\n    police under my command, I make known that if any firearm is\r\n    discharged or bombs thrown at them the most drastic reprisals will\r\n    instantly be made _against property surrounding the scene of the\r\n    outrage_. Therefore it behooves all loyal inhabitants to see to it\r\n    that no evil-disposed agitator is allowed on his premises.\r\n\r\n    4. During the period of Martial Law I prohibit all processions,\r\n    meetings or other gatherings of more than 10 persons without my\r\n    written authority, and any such meetings, gatherings or\r\n    processions held in disobedience of this order will be broken up\r\n    by force without warning.\r\n\r\n    5. I forbid any person to offer violence or cause obstruction to\r\n    any person desirous of opening his shop or conducting his business\r\n    or proceeding to his work or business. Any person contravening\r\n    this order will be arrested, tried by a summary court and be\r\n    liable to be shot.\r\n\r\n    6. At present the city of Lahore enjoys the advantage of electric\r\n    lights and a water-supply; but the continuance of these supplies\r\n    will depend on the good behaviour of the inhabitants and their\r\n    prompt obedience to my orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NO. 2\r\n\r\n    All tongas and tum-tums, (horse carriages) whether licensed for\r\n    hire or otherwise, will be delivered up to the Military Officer\r\n    appointed for that purpose at the Punjab Light Horse ground by\r\n    17·00 (5 P.M.) to-day--Tuesday, 15th April. Drivers will receive\r\n    pay and horses be rationed.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NO. 3\r\n\r\n    All motor-cars or vehicles of any descriptions will be delivered\r\n    to the Military Officer appointed for that purpose at the Punjab\r\n    club by 17·00 (5 P.M.) this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NO. 4\r\n\r\n    By virtue of the powers vested in me I have prohibited the issue\r\n    of third or intermediate class tickets at all railway stations in\r\n    the Lahore Civil Command, _except only in the case of servants\r\n    travelling with their European masters or servants or others in\r\n    the employ of the Government_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NO. 5\r\n\r\n    Whereas, from information received by me, it would appear that\r\n    shops, generally known as Langars, for the sale of cooked food,\r\n    are used for the purpose of illegal meetings, and for the\r\n    dissemination of seditious _propaganda_, and whereas I notice that\r\n    all other shops (particularly in Lahore city) have been closed as\r\n    part of an organized demonstration against his Majesty's\r\n    Government, now, therefore, by virtue of the powers vested in me\r\n    under Martial Law, I order that all such Langars or shops for the\r\n    sale of cooked food in the Lahore civil area, except such as may\r\n    be granted an exemption in writing by me shall close and cease to\r\n    trade by 10·00 hours (10 A.M.) tomorrow, Wednesday, the 16th\r\n    April, 1919.\r\n\r\n    Disobedience to this order will result in the confiscation of the\r\n    contents of such shop and the arrest and trial by summary\r\n    procedure of the owner or owners.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    NO. 7\r\n\r\n    Whereas I have reason to believe that certain students of the D.\r\n    A. V. College in Lahore are engaged in spreading seditious\r\n    _propaganda_ directed against his Majesty's Government, and\r\n    whereas I deem it expedient in the interests of the preservation\r\n    of law and order to restrict the activities of such students, I\r\n    make the following order:--\r\n\r\n    _All students of the said college_ now in this Command area will\r\n    report themselves to the Officer Commanding Troops at the\r\n    Bradlaugh Hall daily at the hours specified below and remain there\r\n    until the roll of such students has been called by the principal\r\n    or some other officer approved by me acting on his behalf, and\r\n    until they have been dismissed by the Officer Commanding Troops at\r\n    Bradlaugh Hall.\r\n\r\n      07·00 hours. (7 A.M.)\r\n      11·00 hours. (11 A.M.)\r\n      15·00 hours. (3 P.M.)\r\n      19·30 hours. (7.30 P.M.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    NO. 8\r\n\r\n    Whereas some evilly-disposed persons have torn down or defaced\r\n    notices and orders which I have caused to be exhibited for\r\n    information and good government of the people in the Lahore\r\n    (Civil) Command.\r\n\r\n    In future all orders that I have to issue under Martial Law _will\r\n    be handed to such owners of property as I may select and it will\r\n    be the duty of such owners of property to exhibit and keep\r\n    exhibited and undamaged in the position on their property selected\r\n    by me all such orders_.\r\n\r\n    The duty of protecting such orders will therefore devolve on the\r\n    owners of property and failure to ensure the proper protection and\r\n    continued exhibition of my orders will result in severe\r\n    punishment.\r\n\r\n    _Similarly, I hold responsible the owner of any property on which\r\n    seditious or any other notices, proclamations or writing not\r\n    authorized by me are exhibited._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    NO. 13\r\n\r\n    Whereas information laid before me shows that a martial law notice\r\n    issued by me and posted by my orders on a property known as the\r\n    Sanatan Dharam College Hostel on Bahawalpur road, has been torn or\r\n    otherwise defaced, in contravention of my Martial Law Notice No. 8.\r\n\r\n    Now, therefore, by virtue of the powers vested in me under martial\r\n    law, I order the immediate arrest of _all male persons domiciled\r\n    in the said hostel and their internment in the Lahore Fort_\r\n    pending my further orders as to their trial or other disposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NO. 14\r\n\r\n    Whereas practically every shop and business establishment in the\r\n    area under my command has been closed in accordance with the\r\n    _hartal_ or organized closure of business directed against his\r\n    Majesty's Government.\r\n\r\n    And whereas the continuance or resumption of such _hartal_ is\r\n    detrimental to the good order and governance of the said area.\r\n\r\n    And whereas I deem it expedient to cause the said _hartal_ to\r\n    entirely cease:\r\n\r\n    Now therefore by virtue of the powers vested in me by martial law\r\n    I make the following order, namely:--\r\n\r\n    By 10·00 hours (10 A.M.) tomorrow (Friday), the 18th day of April,\r\n    1919, every shop and business establishment (except only _langare_\r\n    referred to in martial law notice No. 5, dated 15th April, 1919)\r\n    in the area under my command, shall open and carry on its business\r\n    _and thereafter daily shall continue to keep open and carry on its\r\n    business_ during the usual hours up to 20·00 hours (8 P.M.) in\r\n    exactly the same manner as before the creation of the said\r\n    _hartal_.\r\n\r\n    And likewise I order that every skilled or other worker will from\r\n    10·30 hours (10.30 A.M.) tomorrow, resume and continue during the\r\n    usual hours his ordinary trade, work or calling.\r\n\r\n    And I warn all concerned that if at 10·00 hours (10 A.M.)\r\n    tomorrow, or at any subsequent time I find this order has been\r\n    without good and valid reason disobeyed, the persons concerned\r\n    will be arrested and tried under the summary procedure of martial\r\n    law, and shops so closed will be opened and kept open by force,\r\n    any resultant loss arising from such forcible opening will rest on\r\n    the owners and on occupiers concerned.\r\n\r\n    And I further warn all concerned that this order must be strictly\r\n    obeyed in spirit as well as in letter, that is to say, that to\r\n    open a shop and then refuse to sell goods and to charge an\r\n    exorbitant or prohibitive rate, will be deemed a contravention of\r\n    this order.\r\n\r\n    [Note: Shops had evidently remained closed for seven days.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    NO. 15\r\n\r\n    Whereas it has come to my knowledge that the present state of\r\n    unrest is being added to and encouraged by the spreading of false,\r\n    inaccurate or exaggerated reports or rumours:\r\n\r\n    Now, therefore, by virtue of the powers vested in me by martial\r\n    law I give notice that _any person_ found guilty of publishing,\r\n    spreading or repeating, false, inaccurate or exaggerated reports\r\n    in connection with the military or political situation, will be\r\n    arrested and summarily dealt with under martial law.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NO. 16\r\n\r\n    Whereas I have reason to believe that certain students of the Dyal\r\n    Singh College in Lahore are engaged in spreading seditious\r\n    propaganda directed against his Majesty's Government and whereas I\r\n    deem it expedient in the interest of the preservation of law and\r\n    order to restrict the activities of such students, I make the\r\n    following order:--\r\n\r\n    _All students of the said college_ now in this command area will\r\n    report themselves to the officer commanding troops at the\r\n    telegraph office daily at the hours specified below and remain\r\n    there until the roll of such students has been called by the\r\n    principal or some other officer approved by me acting on his\r\n    behalf, and until they have been dismissed by the Officer\r\n    Commanding Troops at the telegraph office:--\r\n\r\n      07·00 hours. (7 A.M.)\r\n      11·00 hours. (11 A.M.)\r\n      15·00 hours. (3 P.M.)\r\n      19·00 hours. (7 P.M.)\r\n\r\n    First parade at 11·00 hours (11 A.M.) on the (?)

Disobedience\r\n    to this order will be punished by special powers under martial\r\n    law. It shall also be illegal for any male person to carry or be\r\n    found in possession of an instrument known as a _lathi_. All\r\n    persons disobeying this order will be arrested and tried by\r\n    summary proceedings under martial law.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    NO. 24\r\n\r\n    Whereas I deem it expedient to make provision for the preservation\r\n    of health and the greater comfort of British troops stationed in\r\n    the area under my command,\r\n\r\n    And whereas a number of electric fans and lights are required in\r\n    the buildings in which some of such troops are quartered,\r\n\r\n    Now therefore by virtue of the powers vested in me by martial law\r\n    I authorize any officer appointed by me for that purpose to enter\r\n    any college, public building, hostel, hotel, private or other\r\n    residence or building and remove such number of electric lights\r\n    and fans required for the purpose aforesaid,\r\n\r\n    And any attempt to obstruct such removal, or to hide, or to damage\r\n    or to impair the immediate efficiency of any such fans or lights,\r\n    will be summarily dealt with under martial law,\r\n\r\n    But nothing in this order shall authorize the removal of any fan\r\n    or light from a room usually inhabited by a woman.\r\n\r\n    These are only a few of the orders we have been able to obtain.\r\n\r\n    For weeks the Punjab was in a state of terror. Almost all of the\r\n    Native papers were either directly or indirectly suppressed or\r\n    terrorized into silence. Numerous persons were arrested and placed\r\n    for trial before military commissioners. Among them were a large\r\n    number of the most honored men in the province. Legal counsel from\r\n    outside the province was denied to them, and admission of\r\n    newspapermen into the province barred. In punishing the persons\r\n    found guilty the military commissioners have awarded sentences,\r\n    the parallel of which can only be found in the history of Czarism\r\n    in Russia. Flogging in the public was resorted to in more than one\r\n    place. In short, a complete reign of terror was established. So\r\n    great was the terrorism that the whole country was thrown into\r\n    such a paroxysm of rage, anger and despair as to make the people\r\n    forget the desire for a political constitution at this terrible\r\n    price.\r\n\r\nJust as I am writing these lines I learn from the London _Times_ that\r\nthe reports of the two committees that were sent to India to inquire\r\ninto (_a_) questions connected with the franchise and (_b_) the division\r\nof functions between the Government of India and local governments, and\r\nbetween the official and the popular elements in the local governments,\r\nhave been published in Great Britain. In one of the Appendices is given\r\na rather brief and inadequate summary of the recommendations of these\r\ncommittees published by the London _Times_. At this stage it is\r\nimpossible to make any comments except that the franchise is by no\r\nmeans as broad as it could have been, the restriction of local residence\r\non candidates for the provincial Legislative Councils extremely\r\nunreasonable, and the strength of the Provincial Councils very meagre.\r\nThe recommendations are unsatisfactory in other respects also, specially\r\nthe power granted to the Governor to dismiss ministers.\r\n\r\nThe question, however, is, \"Will the Cabinet stand by these\r\nrecommendations or will they allow them to be whittled down?\" Mr.\r\nMontagu's bill, which is promised to be introduced in the House of\r\nCommons early in June, will answer the question.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I have to tender my thanks to my friend Dr. J. T.\r\nSunderland for having read my proofs.\r\n\r\n  _June 2, 1919._\r\n\r\n                                                          LAJPAT RAI\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This Hindu happened to be the leader of a section of the Arya\r\nSamaj--an organization known for its bitter attitude towards\r\nMohammedanism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n        PREFACE, v\r\n      I INTRODUCTORY, 1\r\n     II DEMOCRACY IN INDIA, 16\r\n    III THE PRESENT IDEALS, 30\r\n     IV THE STAGES, 36\r\n      V THE CONDITIONS OF THE PROBLEM, 39\r\n     VI THE PUBLIC SERVICES IN INDIA, 62\r\n    VII THE INDIAN ARMY AND NAVY, 84\r\n   VIII THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY IN INDIA, 91\r\n     IX THE NATIVE STATES, 98\r\n      X THE PROPOSALS, 110\r\n     XI INDIA'S CLAIM TO FISCAL AUTONOMY, 136\r\n    XII THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT, 146\r\n   XIII THE PUNJAB, 164\r\n    XIV RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REPRESSIVE LEGISLATION, 175\r\n     XV THE REVOLUTIONARY PARTY, 181\r\n    XVI EDUCATION, 190\r\n   XVII THE PROBLEM, 197\r\n  XVIII THE INTERNATIONAL ASPECT, 205\r\n        APPENDIX A, 209\r\n        APPENDIX B, 225\r\n        APPENDIX C, 231\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Political Future of India\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\n    Now we are faced with the greatest and the grimmest struggle of\r\n    all. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, not amongst men, but amongst\r\n    nations--great and small, powerful and weak, exalted and\r\n    humble,--equality, fraternity, amongst peoples as well as amongst\r\n    men--that is the challenge which has been thrown to us.... My\r\n    appeal to the people of this country, and, if my appeal can reach\r\n    beyond it, is this, that we should continue to fight for the great\r\n    goal of international right and international justice, so that\r\n    never again shall brute force sit on the throne of justice, nor\r\n    barbaric strength wield the sceptre of right.\r\n\r\n                                              DAVID LLOYD GEORGE\r\n\r\n                        \"Causes and Aims of the War.\" Speech delivered\r\n                        at Glasgow, on being presented with the freedom\r\n                        of that city, June 29, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are told that the world is going to be reconstructed on entirely new\r\nlines; that all nations, big or small, shall be allowed the right of\r\nself-determination; that the weaker and backward peoples will no longer\r\nbe permitted to be exploited and dominated by the stronger and the more\r\nadvanced nations of the earth; and that justice will be done to all.\r\n\"What we seek,\" says President Wilson, \"is the reign of law, based upon\r\nthe consent of the governed and sustained by the organized opinion of\r\nmankind.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indian people also form a part of the world that needs\r\nreconstructing. They constitute one-fifth of the human race, and inhabit\r\nabout two million square miles of very fertile and productive territory.\r\nThey have been a civilized people for thousands of years, though their\r\ncivilization is a bit different from that of the West. We advisedly say\r\n\"a bit different,\" because in fundamentals that civilization has the\r\nsame basic origin as that of Greece and Rome, the three peoples having\r\noriginally sprung from the same stock and their languages, also, being\r\nof common descent. For the last 150 years, or (even) more, India has\r\nbeen ruled by Great Britain. Her people have been denied any determining\r\nvoice in the management of their own affairs. For over thirty years or\r\nmore they have carried on an organized agitation for an autonomous form\r\nof Government within the British Empire. This movement received almost\r\nno response from the responsible statesmen of the Empire until late in\r\nthe war. In the meantime some of the leaders grew sullen and\r\ndownhearted, and, under the influence of bitter disappointment and\r\nalmost of despair, took to revolutionary forms. The bulk of the people,\r\nhowever, have kept their balance and have never faltered in their faith\r\nin peaceful methods. When the war broke out the people of India at once\r\nrealized the world significance of this titanic struggle and in no\r\nuncertain voice declared their allegiance to the cause of the Allies.\r\nOur masters, however, while gratefully accepting our economic\r\ncontributions and utilizing the standing Indian army, spurned our offers\r\nfor further military contributions. In the military development of the\r\nIndians they saw a menace to their supremacy in India.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Revolution first, and then the entry of the United States\r\ninto the War, brought about a change in the point of view of the British\r\nstatesmen. For the first time they realized that they could not win the\r\nwar without the fullest coöperation of the people of India, both in the\r\nmilitary and the economic sense and that the fullest coöperation of the\r\nUnited States also required as a condition precedent, quite a radical\r\nrevision of their war aims. President Wilson's political idealism, his\r\nshort, pithy and epigrammatic formulas compelled similar declarations by\r\nAllied statesmen. The British statesmen, at the helm of affairs, found\r\nit necessary to affirm their faith in President Wilson's principles and\r\nformulas if they would not let the morale of their own people at home\r\nsuffer in comparison. In the meantime the situation in India was\r\nbecoming uncomfortable. The Nationalists and the Home Rulers insisted on\r\na clear and unequivocal declaration of policy on the lines of President\r\nWilson's principles. The British statesmen in charge of Indian affairs,\r\nat Whitehall, were still temporizing when the report of the Royal\r\nCommission on the causes of the Mesopotamia disaster burst out on the\r\nhalf-dazed British mind like a bombshell. To the awakening caused by the\r\nreport and its disclosures a material contribution was made by the\r\noutspoken, candid and clear-cut speech of a younger statesman, whose\r\nknowledge of the working of the Indian Government could not be\r\nquestioned. When the Parliament, press and platform were all ablaze with\r\nindignation and shame at the supposed incompetence of the Indian\r\nGovernment, to whose inefficiency and culpable neglect of duty were\r\nascribed the series of disasters that ended with the surrender of a\r\nBritish force at Kut-el-amara, Mr. Edwin Samuel Montagu, who had been an\r\nUnder Secretary for India under Lord Morley and was at the time of the\r\nMesopotamia disaster Minister of Munitions, came out with a strong and\r\nemphatic condemnation of the system and the form of Government under\r\nwhich the \"myriads\" of India lived and had their affairs managed. Mr.\r\nMontagu's opinion of the machinery of the Indian Government was\r\nexpressed as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"The machinery of Government in this country with its unwritten\r\n    constitution, and the machinery of Government in our Dominions has\r\n    proved itself sufficiently elastic, sufficiently capable of\r\n    modification, to turn a peace-pursuing instrument into a\r\n    war-making instrument. It is the Government of India alone which\r\n    does not seem capable of transformation, and I regard that as\r\n    based upon the fact that the machinery is statute-ridden\r\n    machinery. The Government of India is too wooden, too iron, too\r\n    inelastic, too antediluvian, to be any use for the modern purposes\r\n    we have in view. I do not believe that anybody could ever support\r\n    the Government of India from the point of view of modern\r\n    requirements. But it would do. Nothing serious had happened since\r\n    the Indian mutiny, the public was not interested in Indian\r\n    affairs, and it required a crisis to direct attention to the fact\r\n    that the Indian Government is an indefensible system of\r\n    Government.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding the Indian Budget Debates in Parliament, he said:\r\n\r\n    \"Does anybody remember the Indian Budget Debates before the War?\r\n    Upon that day the House was always empty. India did not matter,\r\n    and the Debates were left to people on the one side whom their\r\n    enemies sometimes called \"bureaucrats,\" and on the other side to\r\n    people whom their enemies sometimes called \"seditionists,\" until\r\n    it almost came to be disreputable to take part in Indian Debates.\r\n    It required a crisis of this kind to realise how important Indian\r\n    affairs were. After all, is the House of Commons to be blamed for\r\n    that? What was the Indian Budget Debate? It was a purely academic\r\n    discussion which had no effect whatever upon events in India,\r\n    conducted after the events that were being discussed, had taken\r\n    place.\"\r\n\r\nHe held that the salary of the Indian Secretary of State should be paid\r\nfrom the British Treasury, and then there would be real debates:\r\n\r\n    \"How can you defend the fact that the Secretaries of State for\r\n    India alone of all the occupants of the Front Bench, with the\r\n    possible exception of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,\r\n    are not responsible to this House for their salaries, and do not\r\n    come here with their Estimates in order that the House of Commons\r\n    may express its opinion....\r\n\r\n    \"What I am saying now is in the light of these revelations of this\r\n    inelasticity of Indian government. However much you could gloss\r\n    over those indefensible proceedings in the past, the time has now\r\n    come to alter them.\r\n\r\n    \"The tone of those Debates is unreal, unsubstantial and\r\n    ineffective. If Estimates for India, like Estimates for the\r\n    Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and the Colonial Secretary\r\n    were to be discussed on the floor of the House of Commons, the\r\n    Debates on India would be as good as the Debates on foreign\r\n    affairs. After all, what is the difference? Has it even been\r\n    suggested to the people of Australia that they should pay the\r\n    salary of the Secretary of State for the Colony? Why should the\r\n    whole cost of that building in Charles Street, including the\r\n    building itself, be an item of the Indian taxpayer's burden rather\r\n    than of this House of Commons and the people of the country?\"\r\n\r\nCan and does the House of Commons control the India Office? Here is Mr.\r\nMontagu's answer.\r\n\r\n    \"It has been sometimes questioned whether a democracy can rule an\r\n    Empire. I say that in this instance the democracy has never had\r\n    the opportunity of trying. But even if the House of Commons were\r\n    to give orders to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State\r\n    is not his own master. In matters vitally affecting India, he can\r\n    be overruled by a majority of his Council. I may be told that the\r\n    cases are very rare in which the Council has differed from the\r\n    Secretary of State for India. I know one case anyhow, where it was\r\n    a very near thing, and where the action of the Council might\r\n    without remedy have involved the Government of India in a policy\r\n    out of harmony with the declared policy of the House of Commons\r\n    and the Cabinet. And these gentlemen are appointed for seven\r\n    years, and can only be controlled from the Houses of Parliament by\r\n    a resolution carried in both Houses calling on them for their\r\n    resignations. The whole system of the India Office is designed to\r\n    prevent control by the House of Commons for fear that there might\r\n    be too advanced a Secretary of State. I do not say that it is\r\n    possible to govern India through the intervention of the Secretary\r\n    of State with no expert advice, but what I do say is that in this\r\n    epoch now after the Mesopotamia Report, he must get his expert\r\n    advice in some other way than by this Council of men, great men\r\n    though, no doubt, they always are, who come home after lengthy\r\n    service in India to spend the first years of their retirement as\r\n    members of the Council of India.\r\n\r\n    \"Does any Member of this House know much about procedure in the\r\n    India Office? I have been to the India Office and to other\r\n    offices. I tell this House that the statutory organization of the\r\n    India Office produces an apotheosis of circumlocution and red tape\r\n    beyond the dreams of any ordinary citizen.\"\r\n\r\nHis own idea of what should be done at that juncture was thus expressed:\r\n\r\n    \"But whatever be the object of your rule in India, the universal\r\n    demand of those Indians whom I have met and corresponded with, is\r\n    that you should state it. Having stated it, you should give some\r\n    instalment to show that you are in real earnest, some beginning of\r\n    the new plan which you intend to pursue, that gives you the\r\n    opportunity of giving greater representative institutions in some\r\n    form or other to the people of India....\r\n\r\n    \"But I am positive of this, that your great claim to continue the\r\n    illogical system of Government by which we have governed India in\r\n    the past is that it was efficient. It has been proved to be not\r\n    efficient. It has been proved to be not sufficiently elastic to\r\n    express the will of the Indian people; to make them into a warring\r\n    Nation as they wanted to be. The history of this War shows that\r\n    you can rely upon the loyalty of the Indian people to the British\r\n    Empire--if you ever before doubted it! If you want to use that\r\n    loyalty, you must take advantage of that love of country which is\r\n    a religion in India, and you must give them that bigger\r\n    opportunity of controlling their own destinies, not merely by\r\n    Councils which cannot act, but by control, by growing control, of\r\n    the Executive itself. Then in your next War--if we ever have\r\n    War--in your next crisis, through times of peace, you will have a\r\n    contented India, an India equipped to help. Believe me, Mr.\r\n    Speaker, it is not a question of expediency, it is not a question\r\n    of desirability. Unless you are prepared to remodel, in the light\r\n    of modern experience, this century-old and cumberous machine,\r\n    then, I believe, I verily believe, that you will lose your right\r\n    to control the destinies of the Indian Empire.\"\r\n\r\nThe quick and resourceful mind of Premier Lloyd George at once grasped\r\nthe situation. He lost no time in deciding what was needed. Probably\r\nover the head of his Tory colleagues, possibly with their consent, he\r\ngave the Indian portfolio to Mr. Montagu, and told him quietly to set to\r\nbusiness. Mr. Montagu's first step was the announcement of August 20,\r\n1917. On that date he made in the House of Commons the following\r\nmemorable statement:\r\n\r\n    \"The policy of His Majesty's Government, with which the Government\r\n    of India are in complete accord, is that of the increasing\r\n    association of Indians in every branch of the administration and\r\n    the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view\r\n    to the progressive realisation of responsible government in India\r\n    as an integral part of the British Empire. They have decided that\r\n    substantial steps in this direction should be taken as soon as\r\n    possible, and that it is of the highest importance as a\r\n    preliminary to considering what these steps should be that there\r\n    should be a free and informal exchange of opinion between those in\r\n    authority at home and in India. His Majesty's Government have\r\n    accordingly decided, with His Majesty's approval, that I should\r\n    accept the Viceroy's invitation to proceed to India to discuss\r\n    these matters with the Viceroy and the Government of India, to\r\n    consider with the Viceroy the views of local Governments, and to\r\n    receive with him the suggestions of representative bodies and\r\n    others.\r\n\r\n    \"I would add that progress in this policy can only be achieved by\r\n    successive stages. The British Government and the Government of\r\n    India, on whom the responsibility lies for the welfare and\r\n    advancement of the Indian peoples, must be judges of the time and\r\n    measure of each advance, and they must be guided by the\r\n    co-operation received from those upon whom new opportunities of\r\n    service will thus be conferred and by the extent to which it is\r\n    found that confidence can be reposed in their sense of\r\n    responsibility.\r\n\r\n    \"Ample opportunity will be afforded for public discussion of the\r\n    proposals which will be submitted in due course to Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the content of the second sentence of paragraph two\r\nin the above announcement is in fundamental opposition to the right of\r\nevery nation to self-determination, a principle now admitted to be of\r\ngeneral application (including, according to the British Premier, even\r\nthe black races inhabiting the Colonies that were occupied by Germany\r\nbefore the War, within its purview). The people of India are not on the\r\nlevel of these races. Even if it be assumed that they are not yet in a\r\nposition to exercise that right, fully and properly, it is neither right\r\nnor just to assume that they shall never be in that position even\r\nhereafter. The qualifications implied in that sentence are, besides,\r\nquite needless and superfluous. As long as India remains \"an integral\r\npart of the British Empire\" she cannot draft a constitution which does\r\nnot meet with the approval of the British Parliament and the British\r\nSovereign. It is to be regretted that the British statesmen could not\r\nrise equal to the spirit of the times and make an announcement free from\r\nthat spirit of autocratic bluster and racial swagger which was entirely\r\nout of place at a time when they were making impassioned appeals\r\nto Indian manhood to share the burdens of Empire by contributing\r\nungrudgingly in men and money for its defence. This attitude is\r\nsomewhat inconsistent with the statements in paragraph 179 of the\r\nMontagu-Chelmsford Report, wherein, after referring to the natural\r\nevolution of \"the desire for self-determination,\" the distinguished\r\nauthors of the Report concede that \"the demand that now meets us from\r\nthe educated classes of India is no more than the right and natural\r\noutcome of the work of a hundred years.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of this uncalled for reservation in the announcement, it is\r\nperfectly true that \"the announcement marks the end of one epoch and the\r\nbeginning of a new one.\" What makes the announcement \"momentous,\"\r\nhowever, is not the language used, as even more high-sounding phrases\r\nhave been used before by eminent British statesmen of the position of\r\nWarren Hastings, Macaulay, Munroe, Metcalf and others, but the fact that\r\nthe statement has been made by the Secretary of State for India, as\r\nrepresenting the Crown and the Cabinet who, in their turn, are the\r\nconstitutional representatives of the people of Great Britain and\r\nIreland. The statement is thus both morally and legally binding on the\r\nBritish people, though it will not acquire that character so far as the\r\npeople of India are concerned, unless it is embodied in a Statute of\r\nParliament. Is it too much to hope that when that stage comes the second\r\nsentence of the second paragraph might be omitted or so modified as to\r\nremove the inconsistency pointed out above?\r\n\r\nWe have no doubt, however, that the language of the announcement\r\nnotwithstanding, the destiny of India remains ultimately in the hands of\r\nthe Indians themselves. It will be determined, favorably or unfavorably,\r\nby the solidity of their public life, by the purity and idealism of the\r\nIndian public men to be hereafter entrusted with the task of\r\nadministration, by the honesty and intensity of their endeavor to uplift\r\nthe masses, both intellectually and economically, by the extent to which\r\nthey reduce the religious and communal excuses that are being put forth\r\nas reasons for half-hearted advance, and by the amount of political\r\nunity they generate in the nation. The well known maxim that those who\r\nwill must by themselves be free, is as good today as ever. They will\r\nhave to do all this in order to persuade the British Parliament to\r\ndeclare them fit for responsible Government. Once they show their\r\nfitness by deeds and by actual conduct, no one can keep them in\r\nleading-strings.\r\n\r\nComing back to the announcement itself, would it not be well to bear in\r\nmind that what differentiates this announcement from the statutory\r\ndeclarations of the Act of 1833 and the Royal proclamation of 1858 is\r\nnot the language used but the step or steps taken to ascertain Indian\r\nopinion, to understand and interpret it in accordance with the spirit of\r\nthe times and the frankness and fairness with which the whole problem is\r\nstated in the joint report of the two statesmen, who are the present\r\nofficial heads of the Government of India. Nor can it be denied that the\r\nannouncement and the report have received the cordial appreciation of\r\nthe Indian leaders.\r\n\r\nWe, that is, the Indian Nationalists, have heretofore concerned\r\nourselves more with criticism of the British administration than with\r\nthe problem of construction, though our criticism has never been merely\r\ndestructive. We have always ended with constructive suggestions.\r\nHenceforth, if the spirit of the announcement is translated into deeds\r\nit will be our duty to coöperate actively in constructive thought. Not\r\nthat we refused coöperation in the past, but the conditions and the\r\nterms on which we were asked to coöperate made it impossible for us to\r\nmake an effective response.\r\n\r\nSeveral British critics of the Indian Nationalists have from time to\r\ntime charged them with lack of constructive ability. They ignore the\r\nfact that political conditions in India were an effective bar to any\r\ndisplay of ability.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt at constitution making was made by the Congress in\r\n1915, and as such was bound to be rather timid and half-hearted. The\r\nsituation since then has considerably improved and the discussions of\r\nthe last twelve months have enabled the Secretary for India and the\r\nViceroy to claim that, in certain respects, at least, their scheme is a\r\nmore effective step towards responsible Government than the scheme\r\npromulgated jointly by the Congress and the Muslim League. How far that\r\nclaim can be substantiated remains to be seen. This much is, however,\r\nclear: come what may, along with the rest of the world, India cannot go\r\nback to the pre-war conditions of life. The high functionaries of the\r\nBritish Government in India are also conscious of that fact, as one of\r\nthem, the present Lieutenant Governor of the United Provinces of Agra\r\nand Oudh, a member of the Indian bureaucracy, remarked only recently in\r\na speech at Allahabad:\r\n\r\n\"Nothing will ever be the same,\" said Sir Harcourt Butler; \"this much is\r\ncertain, that we shall have to shake up all our old ideals and begin\r\nafresh ... we have crossed the watershed and are looking down on new\r\nplains. The old oracles are dumb. The old shibboleths are no more heard.\r\nIdeals, constitutions, rooted ideas are being shovelled away without\r\nargument or comment or memorial.... Our administrative machine belongs\r\nto another age. It is top-heavy. Its movements are cumbrous, slow,\r\ndeliberate. It rejoices in delay. It grew up when time was not the\r\nobject, when no one wanted change, when financial economy was the ruling\r\npassion of Governments, imperial and provincial. Now there are the\r\nstirrings of young national life, and economic springtime, a calling for\r\ndespatch, quick response, bold experiment. Secretariats with enormous\r\noffices overhang the administration. An eminent ecclesiastic once told\r\nme that Rome had, by centuries of experience, reduced delay to a\r\nscience; he used to think her mistress of postponement and\r\nprocrastination, but the Government of India beat Rome every time. Only\r\necclesiatics could dare so to speak of the Government of India. I, for\r\none, will not lay audacious hands on the chariot of the sun.\"\r\n\r\nComing, as it does, from a member of the Anglo-Indian bureaucracy, this\r\nstatement means much more to the Indian people than even the words of\r\nthe British Premier. If this statement is not mere camouflage, but\r\nrepresents a genuine change of heart on the part of the British\r\nbureaucracy in India, then it is all the more inexplicable to us why the\r\nnew scheme of the Secretary for India and the Viceroy should breathe so\r\nmuch distrust of the educated classes of India. Any way, we have nothing\r\nbut praise for the spirit of frankness and fairness which generally\r\ncharacterizes the report. However we might disagree with the conclusions\r\narrived at, it is but right to acknowledge that the analysis of the\r\nproblem and its constituting elements is quite masterly and the attempt\r\nto find a solution which will meet the needs of the situation _as\r\nunderstood by them_ absolutely sincere and genuine. This fact makes it\r\nall the more necessary that Indian Nationalists of all classes and all\r\nshades of opinion should give their best thought to the consideration of\r\nthe problem in a spirit of construction and coöperation, as\r\ndistinguished from mere fault-finding. Nor should it be forgotten for a\r\nmoment that Mr. Montagu and Lord Chelmsford were all the time, when\r\ndrawing their scheme, influenced by considerations of what, under the\r\ncircumstances, is practicable and likely to be accepted, not only in\r\nIndia by the Anglo-Indian bureaucracy and the non-official European\r\ncommunity, but by the _conservative_ British opinion at home. It is the\r\nlatter we have to convince and win over before the scheme has a ghost of\r\na chance of being improved upon. When we say _conservative_ opinion we\r\ninclude in that expression the Liberal and Labour Imperialists also. We\r\nshould never forget that it is hard to part with power, however\r\nidealistic the individual vested with power may be, and it is still\r\nharder to throw away the chances of profit which one (and those in whom\r\none is interested) have gained by efforts extending over a century and a\r\nhalf, and in the exercise of which one sees no immediate danger. I am of\r\nthe opinion that hitherto Indian representation in England has been\r\nextremely meagre, spasmodic and inadequate to the needs of the\r\nsituation. Outside England, India's voice has been altogether unheard.\r\nWe have so far displayed an almost unpardonable simplicity in failing to\r\nrecognise that the world is so situated these days that public opinion\r\nin one country sometimes reacts quite effectively on public opinion in\r\nanother. It is our duty, therefore, to increase our representation in\r\nEngland and to keep our case before the world with fresh energy and\r\nrenewed vigour, not in a spirit of carping denunciation of the British\r\nGovernment of India, but with a desire to educate and enlist liberal and\r\nright-minded opinion all over the world in our favor. In the following\r\npages an attempt is made to examine the Montagu-Chelmsford report in a\r\nspirit of absolute candour and fairness, with practical suggestions for\r\nthe improvement of the scheme in the light of Indian and British\r\ncriticism thereupon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nDEMOCRACY IN INDIA\r\n\r\n    A nation that can sing about its defeat is a nation which is\r\n    immortal.\r\n\r\n                                              DAVID LLOYD GEORGE\r\n\r\n                        \"Serbia.\" Speech delivered at the Serbian\r\n                        Lunch (Savoy Hotel), August 8, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we take up the report of the Secretary for India and the Viceroy\r\nwe intend to clear the ground by briefly meeting the almost universal\r\nimpression that prevails in educated circles in the West, that\r\ndemocratic institutions are foreign to the genius of the Asiatic peoples\r\nand have never been known in India before. The latest statement to this\r\neffect was made by Mr. Reginald Coupland of the _Round Table Quarterly_,\r\nin an article he contributed to the _New Republic_ (September 7, 1918)\r\non \"Responsible Government in India.\" We have neither the time nor the\r\ndesire to go into the question as it relates to other Asiatic countries,\r\nthough we might state, in general terms, that an impartial study of\r\nAsiatic history will disclose that in the centuries preceding the\r\nReformation in Europe, Asia was as democratic or undemocratic as Europe.\r\nSince then democracy has developed on modern lines in Europe. While Asia\r\nhas gradually disintegrated and fallen under foreign domination, Europe\r\nhas progressed towards democracy. As regards India, however, we intend\r\nto refer briefly to what historical evidence is available.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we wish to make clear what we understand by \"democracy.\" There\r\nis no desire to enter into an academic discussion of the subject nor to\r\nburden this book with quotations from eminent thinkers and writers. In\r\nour judgment, the best definition of democracy so far has been furnished\r\nby Abraham Lincoln, viz., \"the government of the people, by the people\r\nand for the people,\" regardless of the process or processes by which\r\nthat government is constituted. One must, however, be clear minded as to\r\nwhat is meant by \"the people.\" Does the expression include all the\r\npeople that inhabit the particular territory to which the expression\r\napplies, regardless of sex, creed, color and race, or does it not? If it\r\ndoes, we are afraid there is little democracy even in Europe and America\r\ntoday. Until recently half of the population was denied all political\r\npower in the State by virtue of sex. Of the other half a substantial\r\npart was denied that right by virtue of economic status or, to be more\r\naccurate, by lack of economic status considered necessary for the\r\nexercise of political power. Even now the Southern States of the United\r\nStates, Amendment XV to the American Constitution notwithstanding,\r\neffectively bar the colored people from the exercise of the franchise\r\nsupposed to have been accorded to them by the amendment. In Europe,\r\nreligious and social bars still exist in the constitutions of the\r\ndifferent states. As Great Britain is supposed to be the most democratic\r\ncountry in Europe, we cannot do better than take the history of the\r\ngrowth of public franchise in that country as the best illustration of\r\nthe growth of democracy in the terms of President Lincoln's formula.\r\n\r\nTravelling backwards, the earliest democratic institutions known to\r\nEurope were those of Greece and Rome. In applying the term \"democratic\"\r\nto the city republics of Greece and Rome it is ignored that these\r\n\"republics\" were in no sense democratic. \"Liberty,\" says Putnam Weale,\r\n\"as it was understood in those two celebrated republics of Athens and\r\nSparta meant abject slavery to the vast mass of the population, slavery\r\nevery whit as cruel as any in the Southern States of the American Union\r\nbefore the war of Liberation.... In neither of these two republics did\r\nthe freemen ever exceed twenty thousand, whilst the slaves ran into\r\nhundreds of thousands, and were used just as the slaves of Asiatics were\r\nused.[1] Thus the Greek republics were simply cities in which a certain\r\nportion of the inhabitants, little qualified to exercise them, had\r\nacquired exclusive privileges, while they kept the great body of their\r\nbrethren in a state of abject slavery.\"[2] Discussing the nature of\r\nRoman citizenship Putnam Weale remarks (p. 25) that \"in spite of the\r\npolite fiction of citizenship, the destinies of scores of millions were\r\neffectively disposed of by a few thousands.\" This was true not only with\r\nregard to the outlying parts of the Empire but even as to Italy itself.\r\n\"Roman liberty,\" continues Putnam Weale, \"though an improvement on Greek\r\nconceptions, was like all liberty of antiquity confined really to those\r\nwho, being present in the capital, could take an active part in the\r\npublic deliberations. It was the liberty of city and not of a land. It\r\nwas therefore exactly similar in practise, if not in theory, to the kind\r\nof liberty, which has always been understood in advanced Asiatic\r\nstates--the system of Government by equipoise and nothing else. The idea\r\nof giving those who lived at a distance from the capital any means of\r\nrepresenting themselves was never considered at all; and so, it was the\r\npopulace of the capital (or only a part of it), aided by such force as\r\nmight be introduced by the contesting generals or leaders, which held\r\nall the actual political power. _Representative Government_--the only\r\neffective guarantee of liberty of any sort--_had therefore not yet been\r\ndreamt of_.\" [The italics are ours.]\r\n\r\nAlison in his _History of Europe_, Vol. I, says: \"The states of\r\nFlorence, Genoa, Venice and Pisa were not in reality free; they were\r\ncommunities _in which a few individuals had usurped_ the rights, and\r\ndisposed of the fortunes, of the great bulk _of their fellow citizens,\r\nwhom they governed as subjects or indeed as slaves_. During the most\r\nflourishing period of their history, the citizens of all Italian\r\nrepublics did not amount to 20,000, and these privileged classes held as\r\nmany million in subjection. The citizens of Venice were 2500 and those\r\nof Genoa 4500, those of Pisa, Siena, Lucca and Florence taken together,\r\nnot above 6000.\" [Italics ours.] Coming to more modern times we find it\r\nstated by Morse Stephens in his _History of Revolutionary Europe_ that\r\n\"the period which preceded the French Revolution and the era of war from\r\nthe troubles of which Modern Europe was to be born may be characterised\r\nas that of the benevolent despots. The State was everything, the nation\r\nnothing.\" Speaking of the eighteenth-century conditions in Europe,\r\nStephens remarks that \"the great majority of the peasants of Europe were\r\nthroughout that century absolute serfs\"; also that \"the mass of the\r\npopulation of Central and Eastern Europe was purely agricultural and in\r\nits poverty expected naught but the bare necessaries of existence. The\r\ncities and consequently the middle classes formed but an insignificant\r\nfactor in the population.\" These quotations reveal the real character of\r\nthe European democracy in ancient and mediæval and even in early modern\r\nEurope up to the end of the eighteenth century, or, to be more accurate,\r\nto the time of the French Revolution. Compare this with the following\r\nfacts about the political institutions of India, during the ancient and\r\nmediæval times:\r\n\r\n(1) First we have the testimony of ancient Brahmanic and Buddhistic\r\nliterature, preserved in their sacred books, about the right of the\r\npeople to elect their rulers; the duty of the rulers to obey _the law_\r\nand their obligation to consult their ministers as well as the\r\nrepresentatives of the public in all important affairs of State.\r\n\r\nThe Vedic literature contains references to non-monarchial forms of\r\nGovernment,[3] makes mention of elected rulers and of assemblies of\r\npeople, though the normal as distinguished from universal form of\r\nGovernment according to Professor Macdonald was by Kings, \"a situation\r\nwhich, as in the case of the Aryan invaders of Greece and of the German\r\ninvaders of England, resulted almost necessarily in strengthening the\r\nmonarchic element of the constitution.\"[4]\r\n\r\nIn the _Aitreya Brahmana_ occur terms which are translated by some as\r\nrepresenting the existence of \"self-governed\" and \"kingless\" states.\r\nThese authorities have been collected, translated and explained by K. P.\r\nJayas Wal and Narendranath Law in a series of articles published in the\r\n_Modern Review_ of Calcutta.\r\n\r\nThe _Mahabharata_, the great Hindu epic, makes mention of kingless\r\nstates or oligarchies. \"In fact,\" says Mr. Banerjea, \"all the Indian\r\nnations of these times possessed popular institutions of some type or\r\nother.\"[5]\r\n\r\nProfessor Rhys Davids has said, in his _Buddhist India_, that \"the\r\nearliest Buddhist records reveal the survival side by side with more or\r\nless powerful monarchies, of republics with either complete or modified\r\nindependence.\" He names ten such republics in Northern India alone. In\r\nregard to the system of Government effective within one of the tribes\r\nthat constituted a republic of their own, the same scholar observes:\r\n\"The administrative and judicial business of the clan was carried out in\r\npublic assembly, at which young and old were alike present in their\r\ncommon Mote Hall. A single chief--how and for what period chosen we do\r\nnot know--was elected an officeholder, presiding over the sessions, or,\r\nif there were no sessions, over the State. He bore the title of _Raja_,\r\nwhich must have meant something like the Roman Consul or the Greek\r\nArchon.\"[6] There is no evidence of the existence of slaves or serfs in\r\nthese communities. Evidently all were freemen.\r\n\r\n(2) We have the evidence of Greek historians of the period who\r\naccompanied Alexander in his Asiatic Campaign, or who, after Alexander's\r\ndeath, represented Greek monarchs at the courts of Indian rulers. \"Even\r\nas late as the date of Alexander's invasion,\" says Mr. Banerjea, \"many\r\nof the nations of the Punjab lived under democratic institutions.\"\r\nSpeaking of one of them called Ambasthas (Sambastai), the Greek author\r\nof _Ancient India_ says: \"They lived in cities in which the democratic\r\nform of Government prevailed.\" \"Curtius,\" adds Mr. Banerjea, \"mentions a\r\npowerful Indian tribe, where the form of Government was democratic, and\r\nnot regal.\"[7] Similarly Arrian, another Greek writer, is quoted as\r\nmentioning several other independent, self-governing tribal communities\r\nwho lived under democratic forms of government and bravely resisted the\r\nadvance of Alexander. One of them, when making submission to Alexander,\r\ntold him that \"they were attached more than any others to freedom and\r\nautonomy, and that their freedom they had preserved intact from the time\r\nDionysos came to India until Alexander's invasion.\"[8] There were some\r\nothers which had an aristocratic form of Government. In one of them\r\nmentioned in _Ancient India_, \"the administration was in the hands of\r\nthree hundred wise men.\"\r\n\r\nAnother Greek writer, Diodoros, speaks of _Patala_ as \"a City of great\r\nnote with a political constitution drawn on the same lines as the\r\nSpartan.\" It may safely be presumed that the Greek meant what he said.\r\nChanakya, the author of a great treatise on political science, mentions\r\nmany powerful oligarchies that existed down to the fourth century A. D.\r\nIn one of the inscriptions, said to be of the sixth century A. D., the\r\n_Malavas_ are referred to as living under a republican form of\r\nGovernment.[9]\r\n\r\n(3) Even when kingship became an established institution the idea that\r\nthe King was only a servant of the people survived for a long time. His\r\n\"remuneration\" was fixed at one-sixth of the produce. His subjects had\r\nthe right to depose him or to turn him out if he failed in his duty. The\r\nauthorities on these points are collected by Mr. Banerjea on pp. 72 and\r\n73 of his book.\r\n\r\n(4) Similarly many authorities are quoted by Mr. Banerjea on pp. 74 and\r\n75 of his learned work showing that, according to Hindu ideals practised\r\nin ancient times, the king was not above the law. He was not an\r\nautocrat. He was as much bound by the law as his subjects. Laws were not\r\nmade by kings. \"Legislation was not among the powers entrusted to a\r\nking,\" says Mr. Banerjea. \"There is no reference in early Vedic\r\nliterature to the exercise of legislative authority by the king, though\r\nlater it is an essential part of his duties,\" says Prof. Macdonell.[10]\r\n\r\n(5) Assemblies and councils are quite frequently mentioned both in the\r\nRig and the Atharva Vedas. \"The popular assembly was a regular\r\ninstitution in the early years of the Buddhistic age (500 to 300 B.C.)\"\r\nChanakya mentions that in the King's Council the decision of the\r\nmajority should prevail.[11] Sukraniti lays down elaborate rules of\r\nprocedure for the conduct of business in these assemblies. \"The Council\r\nwas the chief administrative authority in the kingdom. The King was\r\nsupposed not to do anything without the consent of the Council.\"[12] In\r\n_Kerala_ State, South India, during the first and second centuries of\r\nthe Christian Era, there were five assemblies one of which consisted of\r\n\"representatives of the people summoned from various parts of the\r\nState.\"[13] \"From the Ceylon inscriptions we learn that in that island\r\nall measures were enacted by the King in Council, and all orders were\r\nissued by and under the authority of the Council.\"\r\n\r\nWhile all this is true of Ancient India, we cannot claim the existence\r\nof the same system of Government for mediæval India. Even as regards\r\nAncient India, all that is claimed is that it possessed as much\r\ndemocracy, if not more, as Ancient Greece or Ancient Rome. The\r\nnon-existence of slavery in Northern India gives it therefore a superior\r\ncharacter to that of the Ancient republics of Greece and Rome. In the\r\nSouth, it is believed slavery did exist. Coming to mediæval times\r\ngenerally known as the Mohammedan period of Indian History consisting of\r\ntwo epochs, from 400 to 1200 A.D. and from 1200 to 1800 A.D., we notice\r\nthat the country enjoyed a durable kind of government, cities under\r\nabsolute rule, and villages, as before, self-governed. The absolute rule\r\nwas a benevolent or malevolent despotism according to the character of\r\nthe Hindu or Moslem sovereign who reigned. But in the villages India\r\nmaintained a democratic form of government right up to the beginning of\r\nBritish rule; and though under British rule, it has been practically\r\nsuperseded by the rule of the officials, yet in some parts of the\r\ncountry the spirit is still alive, as will appear from the following\r\ntestimony recorded by Mr. Sidney Webb in his Preface to Mr. John\r\nMatthai's volume, _Village Government in British India_:\r\n\r\n    \"One able collector of long service in Central India informed me\r\n    that he had been, until a few months before, totally unaware that\r\n    anything of the sort existed in any of the villages over which he\r\n    ruled. But being led to make specific inquiries on the subject, he\r\n    had just discovered, in _village after village, a distinctly\r\n    effective if somewhat shadowy, local organization, in one or other\r\n    form of panchayat, which was, in fact, now and then giving\r\n    decisions on matters of communal concern, adjudicating civil\r\n    disputes, and even condemning offenders to reparation and fine_.\r\n    Such a Local Government organization is, of course, 'extra-legal'\r\n    and has no statutory warrant, and, in the eyes of the British\r\n    tribunals, possesses no authority whatever. But it has gone on\r\n    silently existing, possibly for longer than the British Empire\r\n    itself, and is still effectively functioning, merely by common\r\n    consent and with the very real sanction of the local public\r\n    opinion.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Matthai has also made a similar remark in Paragraph 22 of his book\r\n(Introductory).\r\n\r\nVillage councils ordinarily called village _panchayats_ have often been\r\nconfounded with caste panchayats and that fact has been emphasised to\r\nprove that these Indian _panchayats_ were or are anything but\r\ndemocratic. Mr. Sidney Webb and Mr. John Matthai both have controverted\r\nthat position and upon good evidence. Says Mr. Webb:\r\n\r\n    \"One suggestion that these fragments of indigenous Indian Local\r\n    Government seem to afford is that we sometimes tend to exaggerate\r\n    the extent to which the cleavages of caste have prevailed over the\r\n    community of neighbourhood. How often is one informed, 'with\r\n    authority,' that the _panchayat_ of which we catch glimpses must\r\n    be only a caste _panchayat_! It is plain, on the evidence, that\r\n    however frequent and potent may be the _panchayat_ of a caste,\r\n    there have been and still are _panchayats_ of men of different\r\n    castes, exercising the functions of a Village Council over\r\n    villagers of different castes. How widely prevalent these may be\r\n    not even the Government of India can yet inform us. But if people\r\n    would only look for traces of Village Government, instead of\r\n    mainly for evidences of caste dominance, we might learn more on\r\n    the subject.\"\r\n\r\nLater on in the same paragraph Mr. Webb remarks that, even where caste\r\nexists it has, in fact, permitted a great deal of common life, and that\r\nit is compatible with active village councils.\r\n\r\nBesides the evidence furnished by the texts of Hindu codes, law books\r\nand political treatises (like the _Arthasastra_ of _Kautalaya_), and\r\nNítí Shástrá, etc., other good evidence has been produced by Mr. Matthai\r\nin support of the above-mentioned proposition.\r\n\r\nIn Paragraph 23 he refers to the _Madras Epigraphic Report_, 1912-13, in\r\nsupport of the statement that \"there were village assemblies in South\r\nIndia in the tenth century A.D., which 'appear to have consisted of all\r\nthe residents of a village including cultivators, professionals and\r\nmerchants.'\"\r\n\r\n    \"In the _Private Diary of Anandaranga Pillay_, who served as agent\r\n    to Dupleix, the French Governor in South India in the middle of\r\n    the eighteenth century, there is an entry referring to a village\r\n    meeting to consider a case of desecrating the village temple 'in\r\n    which people of all castes--from the Brahman to the Pariah--took\r\n    part.'\"\r\n\r\nIn Paragraph 24, he points out that a village council (_Panchayat_)\r\nmight either be an assembly of all the inhabitants of the village or\r\nonly a select committee consisting of representatives selected on some\r\nrecognized principle. The first are common among less developed\r\ncommunities like those of the aboriginal tribes and the latter in more\r\nhighly organized communities.\r\n\r\nEvidences of bigger assemblies consisting of representatives of more\r\nthan one village, sometimes of more than one district, to decide cases\r\nof importance or dispute between whole villages are also cited in\r\nParagraphs 26 and 27 and 32. On the strength of certain South Indian\r\nInscriptions relating to the Tamil Kingdoms of the 10th century A.D., it\r\nis stated that the administration of the village was carried on by no\r\nless than five or six committees, each vested with jurisdiction relating\r\nto certain definite departments of village life, though there was no\r\nfixed rule on the point. In Paragraphs 33 and 34 the mode of election to\r\nthe committees and the qualifications for membership are set down in\r\ndetail. The procedure seems to have been quite elaborate, though suited\r\nto the level of intelligence of the people concerned. These village\r\ncouncils and committees looked after education, sanitation, poor relief,\r\npublic works, watch and ward, and the administration of justice. To\r\ndescribe the methods by which these departments of village life were\r\nadministered by the village councils requires too much space, but we\r\ngive two excerpts from Chapter II on education:\r\n\r\n    \"The history of village education in India goes back perhaps to\r\n    the beginnings of the village community. The schoolmaster had a\r\n    definite place assigned to him in the village economy, in the same\r\n    manner as the headman, the accountant, the watchman, and the\r\n    artisans. He was an officer of the village community, paid either\r\n    by rent-free lands or by assignments of grain out of the village\r\n    harvest.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The outstanding characteristics of the schools of the Hindu\r\n    village community were: (1) that they were democratic, and (2)\r\n    that they were more secular than spiritual in their instruction\r\n    and their general character.... Nevertheless, when we speak of the\r\n    democratic character of these early Hindu schools, it is to be\r\n    understood that they were democratic only in this sense, that they\r\n    were open not merely to the priestly caste but to all the four\r\n    superior castes alike. There was never any question of admitting\r\n    into the schools those who lay outside the regular caste system\r\n    whose touch would have meant pollution, nor to the great\r\n    aboriginal populations of the country.\"\r\n\r\n    \"This is very similar to the public schools in the Southern\r\n    States, in the United States, where schools for the white children\r\n    are closed to coloured children and vice versa.\"\r\n\r\nFrom what has been stated above it appears that the general impression\r\nthat democratic institutions are _entirely_ foreign to India is nothing\r\nbut the survival of a prejudice originally due to ignorance of Indian\r\nhistory. In collecting his evidence Mr. Matthai has principally drawn\r\nupon South Indian sources. There can be no doubt that abundant evidence\r\nof a similar kind is available as regards North India and is waiting to\r\nbe collected, collated and sifted by other Matthais. We do not contend\r\nthat India had the same kind of representative institutions as Modern\r\nEurope has. In fact no part of the world had. They are all recent\r\ndevelopments. The democratic nature of an institution does not depend on\r\nthe methods of election but on the people's right to express their will,\r\ndirectly, or through their representatives, in the management of their\r\npublic affairs. It is clear that that idea was never altogether absent\r\nfrom Indian life either in theory or in practise. Even under the most\r\nabsolute autocracies, the bulk of the people managed their collective\r\naffairs themselves. They organised and maintained schools; arranged and\r\npaid for sanitation; built public works; provided for watch and ward;\r\nadministered justice, and for all these purposes raised revenues and\r\nspent them in a democratic way. They did so, not only as regards the\r\ninternal affairs of a village, but applied the same principles in the\r\nlarger life of their district or districts. Such a people cannot be said\r\nto have _always_ lived a life dictated and held together by force. Nor\r\ncan it be said with justice that the introduction of modern democratic\r\nmethods in such a country, among such a people, would be the\r\nintroduction of an exotic plant, with the spirit and working of which it\r\nwill take them centuries to be familiar.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] It is extremely doubtful if there were any slaves in India in the\r\ncorresponding period of Indian history. At least, Megasthenes, the Greek\r\nambassador at the Court of Chandra Gupta, did not find any in northern\r\nIndia, though his opinion is not accepted as quite correct. It is said\r\nthat slavery did exist in a mild form in the southern peninsula.\r\n\r\n[2] _The Conflict of Colour_, by PUTNAM WEALE, The Macmillan Co., New\r\nYork, 1910, pp. 20-21.\r\n\r\n[3] _Public Administration in Ancient India_, by P.

Any interference with this right by individuals or nations\r\nof foreign origin is unnatural and unjust. The consent of the governed\r\nis the only logical and just basis of governments. These principles have\r\nbeen reiterated with added force and masterly eloquence by President\r\nWilson in his addresses during the War. They have been accepted and\r\nadopted by the Allied statesmen. No statesman or publicist of standing\r\nin any of the Allied countries can dare question the principles. The\r\ndifficulty, however, arises when we come to apply them practically. At\r\nthis point the practical politician's genius for diplomacy discovers\r\nflaws that provide excuses for the non-application of those principles\r\nif such course seems helpful to his nation or his sovereign.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson has asseverated that \"the day of conquest and\r\naggrandisement is gone,\" which, in plain language, means that the day of\r\nImperialism is over. And, in conformity with the principle stated in the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, that \"All nations have the right to assume\r\namong the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which\r\nthe laws of nature and nature's God entitle them,\" President Wilson has\r\nalso said that \"every people have a right to choose the sovereignty\r\nunder which they shall live\"; that \"national aspirations must be\r\nrespected, and that 'self determination' is not a mere phrase; it is an\r\nimperative principle of action, which statesmen will henceforth ignore\r\nat their peril.\" Yet as _practical men_ we must not ignore the facts of\r\nlife. The world is not at once going to be an ideal place to live in\r\neven if it may become one. It may be that the advanced nations of the\r\nearth which just now divide the political and economic control of the\r\nworld between themselves may accept the underlying policy of the\r\nfollowing statement (of President Wilson) that\r\n\r\n    \"This war had its roots in the disregard of the rights of small\r\n    nations and of nationalities which lacked the union and the force\r\n    to make good their claim to determine their own allegiance and\r\n    their own forms of political life.\"\r\n\r\nand the proposed League of Nations might see that a continuance of the\r\ninjustice thus far done to small or backward nations is no longer\r\npermitted. Being practical men, however, we cannot build on the\r\nassumption that at the end of this war the world is at once to be\r\ntransformed into a paradise and that full justice will be done to all\r\nnations and all peoples alike. We already notice a tendency to restrict\r\nthe application and the enforcement of these principles to the nations\r\nof Europe by the more frequent use of the term \"free nations.\" \"Free\r\nnations\" do not need to be freed. It will be wise, therefore not to be\r\ncarried off our feet by these declarations and statements. Mr. Montagu\r\nand Lord Chelmsford have pointedly reminded us of the Indian saying,\r\n\"hanoz Delhi Dúr Ast\" (i.e. \"Delhi is yet far away\"). But even if they\r\nhad not done so we were not so simple as to be swept away by the mere\r\nlanguage of the war declarations. The wording of the announcement of\r\nAugust 20, 1917, itself did not leave us in doubt about the truth of the\r\nsaying quoted by Mr. Montagu and Lord Chelmsford. We have, therefore, to\r\ntest our ideals and aspirations by the touchstone of practicability and\r\nexpediency. Happily for us there is, in theory, at least, a full\r\nagreement between the political goal set up by the Indian Nationalists\r\nof the Congress school (since endorsed by the Home Rulers) and that set\r\nup by the authors of the announcement of August 20th. This goal is\r\n\"Self-Government within the Empire on terms of equality with the other\r\nparts of it,\" in the language of the Congress school or, \"Responsible\r\nGovernment as an integral part of the British Empire,\" in the language\r\nof the announcement. There is a party of Indian politicians who want\r\ncomplete independence, but at present their number is so limited that we\r\nneed not take serious consideration of their position in the matter. The\r\nvast bulk of the educated classes are agreed:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) That they are content to remain within the British Empire if\r\n    they are allowed a status of equality with the self-governing\r\n    dominions of the Empire.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) That what they want is an autonomous Government on the lines\r\n    of Canada, Australia and the South African Union.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) That they do not want any affiliation with any other Foreign\r\n    Government.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written and said about the loyalty of the people of India\r\nto the British Government. Opinions, however, differ as to its nature.\r\nSome say it is the loyalty of a helpless people or, in other words, a\r\nloyalty dictated by fear or force. Others say it is the loyalty of\r\nopportunism. The British maintain that the loyalty is the outcome of a\r\ngenuine and sincere appreciation of the blessings of the British Empire.\r\nBe that as it may, it is in the interest of both to bring about\r\ncircumstances and conditions which would transform this loyalty whatever\r\nits nature into one of genuine affection and interest. The announcement\r\nof August 20, 1917, may be considered as a first step towards the\r\ncreation of such loyalty, but much will depend on the steps that are\r\ntaken to give practical effect to the policy embodied in the said\r\nannouncement and on the spirit in which the proposed reforms are carried\r\nout. Mr. Montagu and Lord Chelmsford's conception of the \"eventual\r\nfuture of India is a sisterhood of states, self-governing in all matters\r\nof purely local or provincial interest, in some cases corresponding to\r\nexisting provinces, in others perhaps modified in area according to the\r\ncharacter and economic interests of their people. Over this congeries\r\nof States should preside a Central Government increasingly\r\nrepresentative of and responsible to the people of all of them; dealing\r\nwith matters, both internal and external, of common interest to the\r\nwhole of India; acting as arbiter in interstate relations and\r\nrepresenting the interests of all India on equal terms with the\r\nself-governing units of the British Empire.\"[1] The only changes that we\r\nwould propose in the language of this statement are (i) the omission of\r\nthe word \"increasingly\" which is rather misplaced in the conception of\r\nan ideal, and (ii) the substitution of the word \"Commonwealth\" in place\r\nof \"Empire.\" His Highness the Aga Khan considers the use of the term\r\n\"responsible\" government instead of \"self-government\" in the\r\nannouncement as unfortunate because it carries the technical meaning of\r\na government responsible for its existence to an assembly elected by the\r\npeople. On the other hand, self-government can comprise many and varied\r\nforms of expression of the popular will. Further, he is convinced that\r\nthe words \"responsible government\" were used in order to carry with the\r\nSecretary of State and the Prime Minister some more conservative members\r\nof the small war cabinet. It was camouflaged so that the Executive\r\ngovernment hereafter might contain Englishmen, while at the same time\r\nthe administration became sufficiently liberal to be responsible to the\r\npeople. With due respect to the Aga Khan we do not see the logical\r\nconnection between the two. Responsible government may or may not\r\ninvolve the necessary inclusion of Englishmen in the Cabinet. Although\r\nwe may not approve of the interpretation of the expression\r\n\"responsible\" government given to it by the authors of the report, in\r\nour judgment its use as an ideal to be attained expresses more forcibly\r\nthe right of the people to choose their government than the use of the\r\ngeneral term \"self government\" would.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Paragraph 349 of the _Report_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE STAGES\r\n\r\n    There is no protection for life, property, or money in a State\r\n    where the criminal is more powerful than the law. The law of\r\n    nations is no exception, and, until it has been vindicated, the\r\n    peace of the world will always be at the mercy of any nation whose\r\n    professors have assiduously taught it to believe that no crime is\r\n    wrong so long as it leads to the aggrandisement and enrichment of\r\n    the country to which they owe allegiance.\r\n\r\n                                              DAVID LLOYD GEORGE\r\n\r\n                        \"No Halfway House.\" Speech delivered at Gray's\r\n                        Inn, December 14, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on ideals we have shown that there is almost complete\r\nagreement between the bulk of Indian educated men and the British\r\nauthorities as to the immediate goal of Government in India. There is no\r\nsuch agreement, however, as regards the stages by which that goal is to\r\nbe reached, nor on the steps which should be immediately taken to carry\r\nus to the first stage. The four formulas by which Mr. Montagu and Lord\r\nChelmsford profess to be guided in their recommendations are not\r\naccepted in their entirety by the spokesmen of the Indian people. These\r\nformulas are:\r\n\r\n    (1) There should be as far as possible complete popular control in\r\n    local bodies and the largest possible independence for them of\r\n    outside control. (Paragraph 188.)\r\n\r\n    (2) The provinces are the domain in which the earlier steps\r\n    towards the progressive realization of responsible government\r\n    should be taken. Some measure of responsibility should be given at\r\n    once, and our aim is to give complete responsibility as soon as\r\n    conditions permit. This involves at once giving the provinces the\r\n    largest measure of independence, legislative, administrative, and\r\n    financial, of the Government of India which is compatible with the\r\n    due discharge by the latter of its own responsibilities.\r\n    (Paragraph 189.)\r\n\r\n    (3) The Government of India must remain wholly responsible to\r\n    Parliament, and saving such responsibility, its authority in\r\n    essential matters must remain indisputable pending experience of\r\n    the effect of the changes now to be introduced in the provinces.\r\n    In the meantime the Indian Legislative Council should be enlarged\r\n    and made more representative and its opportunities of influencing\r\n    government increased. (Paragraph 190.)\r\n\r\n    (4) In proportion as the foregoing changes take effect, the\r\n    control of Parliament and the Secretary of State over the\r\n    Government of India and provincial Governments must be relaxed.\r\n    (Paragraph 191.)\r\n\r\nThere is no difficulty in accepting the first and the fourth formulas.\r\nThere is some complaint that the actual steps recommended for immediate\r\nadoption to give effect to the policy of the first formula are not in\r\nkeeping with the spirit of the formula and are inadequate. But this we\r\ncan reserve for future consideration.\r\n\r\nNo objection can be taken to the first and the last sentences of the\r\nsecond formula; though there is a great divergence of opinion as regards\r\nthe content of the second. It is maintained by some, and their number\r\nis by no means small,[1] that full responsibility should be conceded to\r\nthe provinces at once and that there is nothing in the conditions\r\nmentioned in the report which justifies the postponement thereof.\r\n\r\nThe third formula, however, is the one about which there is not even a\r\nsemblance of agreement. All political parties and all qualified persons\r\nin India (we mean, of course, Indians of Indian origin) are agreed that\r\nthe assumptions and presumptions upon which this formula is based are\r\nwrong and unacceptable. Native Indian opinion is fairly unanimous on the\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nThere are some who claim full autonomy at once. There are others who\r\nclaim full autonomy except as regards foreign relations, the control of\r\nnative States, the Army and the Navy. All insist that a beginning of\r\nresponsible Government must be made in the Central Government also, and\r\npoint out the absolute necessity of conceding some measure, even if not\r\nfull, of fiscal autonomy. They can see no reason why \"the Government of\r\nIndia must remain wholly responsible to Parliament\" and why \"its\r\nauthority must remain indisputable.\" On these matters Indian opinion\r\njoins issue with the distinguished authors of the report. We will revert\r\nto the subject in another chapter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The non-official members of Bengal, Bombay and the United Provinces\r\nhave made that demand, which has been endorsed by the Indian National\r\nCongress and the All-Indian Muslim League.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE CONDITIONS OF THE PROBLEM\r\n\r\n    Let us, at any rate, make victory so complete that national\r\n    liberty, whether for great nations or for small nations, can never\r\n    be challenged. That is the ordinary law. The small man, the poor\r\n    man, has the same protection as the powerful man. So the little\r\n    nation must be as well guarded and protected as the big nation.\r\n\r\n                                              DAVID LLOYD GEORGE\r\n\r\n                        \"The Pan-German Dream,\" Speech delivered at\r\n                        Queen's Hall on the third anniversary of the\r\n                        Declaration of War, August 4, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eminent authors of the report have devoted an entire chapter to a\r\nconsideration of what they call the \"conditions of the problem.\" These\r\nmay be considered under two different heads: (a) those that necessitate\r\na rather radical reorganisation of the Government of India; (b) those\r\nthat prevent the authors from recommending immediate responsible\r\ngovernment and justify the limitations of their scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMMENSITY OF THE PROBLEM AND THE GRAVITY OF THE TASK\r\n\r\nBefore we take up the two sets of facts relied upon by them in support\r\nof either position we may express our general agreement with them as\r\nregards the gravity of the task and the immensity of the problem. The\r\nsize of the country and the vastness of its population are the measure\r\nof the extent of the problem. The existence of powerful vested interests\r\nat present possessed by the ruling race which may be interfered with by\r\nextended changes in the system of Government are the measure of its\r\ngravity. \"The welfare and happiness of hundreds of millions of people,\"\r\nwhich the authors say are in issue cannot be adequately provided for by\r\nany autocratic system of Government however benevolent its purpose, and\r\nhowever magnificent its organisation. An \"absolute government\" is an\r\nanachronism, but when it is foreign it is doubly so. To bring out \"the\r\nbest in the people\" for their own \"welfare and happiness\" as well as for\r\nthat of mankind in general, it is necessary that the people should be\r\nfree to develop on their own lines, manage their own affairs, evolve\r\ntheir own life, subject only to such restrictions as the general\r\ninterests of humanity demand; and subject to such guidance as the better\r\nplaced and more experienced people of the earth can furnish.\r\n\r\nThe people of India are willing to be guided in their development\r\ntowards modern democracy by the people of Great Britain and they would\r\nbe grateful for their coöperation in this difficult task, but they must\r\nbe made to realize that the task is their own and that they should\r\nundertake it in a spirit of courageous faith--faith in their destiny,\r\nfaith in their ability to achieve it, and faith in the friendship of the\r\ngreat British nation. The test of all measures in relation to the\r\nGovernment of India in future should be, not how far the people of\r\nIndia can coöperate, how far they can be entrusted with responsibility,\r\nbut how far it is necessary _in their interests_ to control and check\r\nthem. The difference between the two points of view is fundamental and\r\nimportant. Mr. Montagu and Lord Chelmsford have looked at the problem\r\nfrom the former point of view; the Indian leaders want them to look at\r\nit from the latter. They want the great British nation to recognise the\r\njustice of India's claim to manage her own affairs, and to keep in their\r\nhands in future only such control as is absolutely necessary (a) to\r\nenable the Indian people to conduct their business efficiently and\r\nsuccessfully, (b) to make them fulfill their obligations to the great\r\nCommonwealth of nations of which they hope soon to be a component part.\r\nAs long as British statesmen insist on looking at the problem from the\r\nformer point of view, they will make mistakes and raise a not entirely\r\nunreasonable suspicion of their motives. The moment they adopt the other\r\npoint of view, they remove all grounds of distrust and create an\r\natmosphere of friendliness in which they can deal with the problem in a\r\nspirit of mutual trust, absolute frankness and candid perspicacity.\r\nThere are many contentions of the British statesmen which the educated\r\nIndians would gladly admit to be valid and necessary were they sure that\r\ntheir admission would not be used against them by the power whom they\r\nhabitually regard as their adversary. There is much in this report which\r\ncould at once be struck out if both parties were actuated by feelings of\r\nmutual trust and friendliness. It cannot be denied that many of the\r\nproposed restrictions on the power of the popular assemblies and the\r\nwould-be Indian Administrators are the outcome of distrust. It is no\r\nwonder then that the Indian leaders in their turn are not quite sure of\r\nthe face value of the many professions of good will that characterise\r\nthe scheme. It is for the removal of this distrust that we appeal as\r\nearnestly as we can to the better mind of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn looking at the conditions of the problem, there is another fallacy\r\nwhich underlies the oft-exaggerated estimates of the blessings of\r\nBritish rule in India by British statesmen and British publicists. They\r\ncompare the India of today with the India of 1757 and at once jump to\r\nthe conclusion that \"the moral and material civilisation of the Indian\r\npeople has made more progress in the last fifty years than during all\r\nthe preceding centuries of their history.\" The proper comparison is of\r\nthe Great Britain, the France, the United States, the Germany, the Italy\r\nand the Japan of 1757, with the India of that year and of India's\r\nprogress within the last century and a half, or even within the last 50\r\nyears, with the progress of these countries in the same period. We have\r\nno desire to withhold credit for what Great Britain has done in India,\r\nbut what she has misdone or could have done but failed to do, by virtue\r\nof her rule in India being absolute and thus necessarily conditioned by\r\nlimitations inevitable in a system of absolute rule, should not be\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nThe Indian critics of British rule in India have repeatedly pointed out\r\nthat what they condemned and criticised was the _system_ and not the\r\npersonnel of the Government, and the distinguished authors of the Report\r\n\"very frankly recognise that the character of political institutions\r\nreacts upon the character of the people\" and that the exercise of\r\nresponsibilities calls forth capacity for it (Paragraph 130), which\r\nmainly accounts for the conditions that serve as reasons for withholding\r\nresponsible government from the Indian people. In discussing \"the basis\r\nof responsibility\" Mr. Montagu and Lord Chelmsford very properly point\r\nout that the qualities necessary for it are only developed by exercise\r\nand that though \"they are greatly affected by education, occupation and\r\nsocial organisation\" \"they ultimately rest on the traditions and habits\r\nof the people.\" \"We cannot go simply to statistics for the measure of\r\nthese things.\" Yet, unfortunately, it is exactly these statistics that\r\nseem to have influenced them largely in the framing of their\r\nhalf-hearted measures. The two dominating conditions which obsess them\r\nare (1) that the immense masses of the people are poor, ignorant and\r\nhelpless far beyond the standards of Europe; and (2) that there runs\r\nthrough Indian society a series of cleavages--of religion, race and\r\ncaste--which constantly threaten its solidarity.\r\n\r\nWe admit the existence of these conditions, but we do not admit that\r\nthey are an effective bar to the beginnings of responsible government\r\neven on that scale on which European countries had it when the\r\nconditions of life in those countries were no better than they are now\r\nin India.\r\n\r\nIt is said that 226 of 244 millions of people in British India live a\r\nrural life: \"agriculture is the one great occupation of the people\" and\r\n\"the proportion of these who even give a thought to matters beyond the\r\nhorizon of their villages is very small.\" We ask did not similar\r\nconditions exist in Great Britain, France and Germany before the\r\ninauguration of the Industrial Revolution, and if they did, did they\r\nstand in the way of their people getting responsible government or\r\nparliamentary institutions? Everyone knows what the conditions in France\r\nwere in years immediately preceding the Revolution. Italy was no better\r\noff in the middle of the nineteenth century. Perhaps it is not much\r\nbetter even today. The masses of the people in these and other countries\r\nof Europe, including Great Britain, were far more ignorant, poor and\r\nhelpless when these countries obtained parliamentary government than\r\nthey are in India today. And the authors of the report are not unaware\r\nthat similar concerns are perhaps the main interests of the population\r\nof some country districts in the United Kingdom even today. In several\r\nof the Balkan States, Roumania, Serbia and Bulgaria--in Italy and in the\r\ncomponent parts of Russia--the conditions are no better, yet their right\r\nto autonomous government, nay, even to absolute independence, is hardly\r\nquestioned. Moreover, as has been pointed out by Mr. Sidney Webb,\r\n\r\n    \"It is a mistake to assume that a land of villages necessarily\r\n    means what is usually implied by the phrase, a people of\r\n    villagers. In truth, India, for all its villages, has been also,\r\n    at all known periods, and to-day still is, perhaps, to a greater\r\n    extent than ever before, what Anglo-Saxon England, for instance\r\n    was _not_ or the South African Republic in the days before gold\r\n    had been discovered, and what the Balkan peninsula even at the\r\n    present time may perhaps not be, namely a land of flourishing\r\n    cities, of a distinctly urban civilization, exhibiting not only\r\n    splendid architecture, and the high development of the\r\n    manufacturing arts made possible by the concentration of\r\n    population and wealth, but likewise--what is much more\r\n    important--a secretion of thought, an accumulation of knowledge,\r\n    and a development of literature and philosophy which are not in\r\n    the least like the characteristic products of villages as we know\r\n    them in Europe or America. And to-day, although the teeming crowds\r\n    who throng the narrow lanes of Calcutta or Benares, Bombay or\r\n    Poona, Madras or Hyderabad, or even the millions who temporarily\r\n    swarm at Hardwar or Allahabad or Puri may include only a small\r\n    percentage of the whole population, yet the Indian social order\r\n    does not seem to be, in the European understanding of the phrase,\r\n    either on its good or on its bad side, essentially one of the\r\n    villagers. The distinction may be of importance, because the Local\r\n    Government developed by peoples of villages, as we know of them in\r\n    Anglo-Saxon England, in the early days of the South African\r\n    Republic, and in the Balkan States, is of a very different type\r\n    from that which takes root and develops, even in the villages, in\r\n    those nations which have also a City life, centers of religious\r\n    activity, colleges and universities, and other 'nodal points,'\r\n    from which emanate, through popular literature, pilgrimages, and\r\n    the newspaper press, slow but far-spreading waves of thought and\r\n    feeling, and aspirations which it is fatal to ignore.\"[1]\r\n\r\nWe have also quoted, in the chapter on \"Democracy in India,\" the\r\nstatement of Morse Stephens, about the condition of the people of Europe\r\nin the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATIONAL BACKWARDNESS\r\n\r\n\"The Educational returns,\" remark the authors of the Report, \"tell us\r\nmuch the same story,\" viz., the appalling dissimilarity of conditions\r\nin Europe and in India. While it is painfully true that the percentage\r\nof illiteracy in India is greater than in any of the countries of\r\nEurope, we cannot admit that that fact is a fatal bar to the beginnings\r\nof responsible government in India or to the granting of a democratic\r\nconstitution to the country. Literacy is, no doubt, a convenient, but by\r\nno means a sure index of the intelligence of the people, even much less\r\nof their character. The political status of a country is determined more\r\nby intelligence and character than by literacy. In these the people of\r\nIndia are inferior to none. By that we do not mean that they are\r\npossessed of the same kind of political responsibility as the people of\r\nthe United Kingdom or of France or of Germany or of the United States,\r\nbut only that by intelligence and character they are quite fitted to\r\nstart on the road to responsible government, at least to such kind as\r\nwas conceded for the first time to Canada, Australia, Italy, the Balkan\r\nStates, Austria, Hungary, etc. The illiteracy of the masses may be a\r\ngood reason for not introducing universal suffrage, but it is hardly a\r\nvalid reason for refusing a kind of constitution which may place India\r\nin the same position, in the matter of responsible Government, as Great\r\nBritain, France, Austria-Hungary, Italy and the United States were when\r\nthose countries showed the same percentage of illiteracy. Literacy has\r\nnowhere been the test of political power. Burma had almost no illiteracy\r\nwhen the British took possession of it; its population was absolutely\r\nhomogeneous and the solidarity of the nation ran no risk from \"cleavages\r\nof religion, race and caste.\" Even today Burma has the highest figures\r\nof literacy in the whole of British India. In that respect it occupies\r\na higher position than Roumania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, many of the\r\nRussian States and perhaps even Italy and Hungary and possibly some of\r\nthe South American Republics. In the matter of race and religion, too,\r\nits position is better than that of the countries mentioned, yet the\r\nauthors of the Report do not propose to concede to it even such\r\nbeginnings of responsible government as they are prepared to grant to\r\nthe other provinces of India. The fact is that mere literacy does not\r\nplay an important part in the awakening of political consciousness in a\r\npeople. It is a useful ingredient of character required for the exercise\r\nof political power but by no means essential.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOVERTY\r\n\r\nThe argument based on poverty is of still less force. On the other hand,\r\nit is the best reason why the people of India should have the power to\r\ndetermine and carry out their fiscal policy. We hope the admissions made\r\nin Paragraph 135 of the Report which we bodily reproduce[2] will once\r\nfor all dispose of the silly statement, so often repeated even by men\r\nwho ought to know better, that materially India has been highly\r\nprosperous under British rule. If so, how is it that in the language of\r\nthe Secretary of State for India and the Viceroy \"enormous masses of the\r\npopulation have little to spare for more than the necessaries of life\"?\r\nWhat about the prosperity of a province, one of the biggest in India\r\n(the United Provinces), in which the number of landlords (not tenants\r\nand farmers) whose income derived from their proprietary holdings\r\nexceeds £20 ($100 a year, which comes to 30 cents a day for the whole\r\nfamily), is about 126,000 out of a population of 48 millions!\r\n\r\nAcceptance of the argument of poverty as sufficient to deprive people of\r\npolitical right is putting a premium on it which is hardly creditable to\r\nthe political ethics of the twentieth century. It is the poorest and the\r\nmost ignorant in the community who most egregiously suffer at the hands\r\nof autocracy. It is they who require protection from it. The wealthy and\r\nthe educated know how to placate the bureaucrat and get what they want.\r\nIt is the poor who pay the penalty of political helplessness, yet,\r\ncuriously, it is for them and in their interest that the English\r\nGovernment in India proposes to withhold the power of the purse from the\r\nproposed Indian Councils and insists on denying the Indian people even\r\nthe elements of responsible government. While we admit the general\r\njustice and accuracy of the observations made under the head of \"extent\r\nof interest in political questions,\" \"political capacity of the rural\r\npopulation,\" we fail to see anything in them which justifies the\r\nconclusion that the interests of the classes not politically minded will\r\nbe safer in the hands of the British officer, and on the whole better\r\nprotected by him than by his educated countrymen who are likely to get\r\nthe power in case of responsible government being conceded now. In our\r\njudgment no greater argument for the immediate grant of a substantial\r\nstep in the direction of complete responsible government throughout\r\nIndia and in all spheres of government, could be advanced than what is\r\ninvolved in the following observation of the authors of the joint\r\nReport:\r\n\r\n    \"The rural classes have the greatest stake in the country because\r\n    they contribute most to its revenues; but they are poorly equipped\r\n    for politics and do not at present wish to take part in them.\r\n    Among them are a few great landlords and a larger number of yeoman\r\n    farmers. They are not ill-fitted to play a part in affairs, but\r\n    with few exceptions they have not yet done so. But what is perhaps\r\n    more important to appreciate than the mere content of political\r\n    life in India is its rate of growth. No one who has observed\r\n    Indian life during even the past five years can doubt that the\r\n    growth is rapid and is real. It is beginning to affect the large\r\n    landholders: here and there are signs of its beginning to affect\r\n    even the villages. But recent events, and above all the war, have\r\n    given it a new earnestness and a more practical character. Men are\r\n    coming to realise more clearly that India's political future is\r\n    not to be won merely by fine phrases: and that it depends on the\r\n    capacity of her people themselves to face difficulties and to\r\n    dispose of them. Hence comes the demand for compulsory education,\r\n    for industries, for tariffs, for social reform, for social, public\r\n    and even military service.\"\r\n\r\nIn the next paragraph, the authors approvingly give an extract from an\r\nofficial report in which it is frankly admitted that the rural\r\npopulation \"may not be vocal, but they are certainly not voiceless.\" The\r\nlast meeting of the Indian Congress was attended by 700 farmer\r\ndelegates. Thousands of farmers have joined the Home Rule Leagues. The\r\nstatement that \"hitherto they have regarded the official as their\r\nrepresentative in the Councils of the Government\" is entirely devoid of\r\nany truth. In their eyes the official is the Government itself. Some of\r\nthem may think that the official _represents_ the Government, but to say\r\nthat they regard the official as \"_their representative_ in the Councils\r\nof the Government\" is a mere travesty of truth. The paragraph on the\r\n\"interests of the ryot\" bristles with so many unwarranted assumptions\r\nthat we must enter an emphatic protest against its misleading nature.\r\n\r\nBut it gives us pleasure to accord our whole-hearted support to the\r\nfollowing statement with which the paragraph opens:\r\n\r\n    \"It is just because the Indian ryot is inarticulate and has not\r\n    been directly represented in our deliberations that we feel bound\r\n    to emphasise the great claim he has upon our consideration. The\r\n    figure of the individual cultivator does not often catch the eye\r\n    of the Governments in Simla and Whitehall. It is chiefly in the\r\n    mass that they deal with him, as a consumer of salt or of\r\n    piece-goods, or unhappily too often as the victim of scarcity or\r\n    disease.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true that \"the district officer and his lieutenants\" are in a\r\nposition to know the difficulties that beset the ryot and his very human\r\nneeds. But of what good is this knowledge of the district officer and\r\nhis lieutenants to him if it has neither provided for the education of\r\nhis children nor made any provision for his employment in occupations\r\nother than agriculture; nor saved him from the intricacies of the law;\r\nnor protected him from the ubiquitous salt tax; nor raised his wages\r\nproportionately to the increase of prices; nor yet put him in a position\r\nto assert his human rights and to obtain redress for his human, too\r\nhuman, wrongs. If we examine a little more carefully the merits of what\r\nis claimed to have been done for him so far by \"an official Government,\"\r\nwe will find that the claim is by no means established.\r\n\r\nWe have no desire to deny that among the foreign officers of the British\r\nGovernment in India there are and have been a great many who were\r\ngenuinely anxious to help the ryot and do all which is claimed to have\r\nbeen done for him in this paragraph, but that they have been unable to\r\ndo anything worth mentioning will be admitted by every right-minded\r\nofficial.[3] The reasons for their failure were not of their making. The\r\nlaws of the land made by the British legislators fresh from the Inns of\r\nCourt, the spirit of the administration and the system of land taxation\r\nhave effectively prevented them from doing many of the things which they\r\nmight otherwise have liked to do. We are sorry that the eminent\r\nstatesmen responsible for the report should have been the unconscious\r\ninstruments of producing an entirely wrong impression by the statements\r\nin this paragraph. If the statements are true, India must be a veritable\r\nparadise and the lot of the Indian ryot enviable. But we know, and the\r\nauthors of the Report knew it as well, and they have stated in so many\r\nwords that it is not so. We can quote any number of authorities to show\r\nthat the Indian ryot is the most pitiable figure in the whole length\r\nand breadth of India, if not in the whole world. This is not the place\r\nto quote the easily accessible opinions of eminently qualified and\r\nhighly trustworthy British writers and administrators on the subject.[4]\r\nThe English official Government has no doubt _professed_ to do all it\r\nclaims to have done for the ryot, but how far it has benefited him in\r\nthese directions is another story. To ask credit for having provided him\r\nwith a system of law \"simple, cheap and certain,\" or for having\r\nestablished schools and dispensaries within reasonable distance of his\r\nresidence; or for even having looked after his cattle, by the provision\r\nof grazing lands; or for having supplied wood for his implements is to\r\nrun violently in the face of facts to the contrary. These are verily his\r\nprincipal complaints against British rule. The official Government is\r\ncertainly entitled to some credit for having started the coöperative\r\ncredit societies and a few coöperative rural banks for the benefit of\r\nthe peasantry, but the reform is so belated and at present plays such an\r\ninsignificant part in the rural economy of India that it seems hardly\r\nworth mentioning or discussing.[5]\r\n\r\nBut even assuming that the official Government has so far done all that\r\nfor the ryot, what reason is there to insinuate that the Government of\r\nthe people will fail to do it for him in the future or will not do it so\r\nwell as or even better, than has been heretofore done by the\r\nbureaucracy? It is quite a gratuitous assumption that in future he will\r\nbe required to do all these things for himself. Even in the most\r\nadvanced democracies in the world the peasantry or the masses of the\r\npeople do not do these things for themselves. Most of these things are\r\ndone by officials. The only difference is that in a responsible\r\ngovernment the officials are the servants of the people while in an\r\nabsolute government they are their masters. We are really surprised at\r\nthe presumption of the British bureaucrat, in posing as the special\r\nfriend of the Indian masses as against their own educated countrymen.\r\nThe experience of the past does not support the claim and there is\r\nabsolutely no reason to assume that it will be different in the future.\r\nA mere cursory glance at the resolutions of the Indian National Congress\r\npassed continuously for a period of thirty years, will show how\r\npersistently and earnestly the educated classes have been pleading\r\n_inter alia_ for (a) compulsory and free education, (b) for technical\r\ninstruction in vocations, (c) for the reduction of the salt tax and the\r\nland tax, (d) for the raising of the minimum incomes liable to income\r\ntax, (e) for the provision of pasture lands, (f) for the comforts of the\r\nthird-class railway travelling public, (g) for the milder administration\r\nof the forest laws, (h) for the reform of the Police, etc. All these\r\nyears the bureaucracy did nothing for the ryot and now they pose as his\r\nspecial friends, whose continuance in power and in office is necessary\r\nfor his protection from the politically minded middle classes. We are a\r\nfriend neither of the landlord nor of the capitalist. We believe that\r\nthe ryot and the working men in India as elsewhere are being exploited\r\nand robbed by the classes in possession of the means of production and\r\ndistribution. We would wholeheartedly support any scheme which would\r\nopen a way to a just and righteous distribution of wealth and land in\r\nIndia and which would insure the ryot and the working man his rightful\r\nplace in the body politic. We would not mind the aid of the foreign\r\nbureaucracy toward that end if we could be sure that the bureaucracy\r\nwould or could do it. But we have no doubts in the matter that it cannot\r\nbe done. The bureaucracy has so far played into the hands of the\r\nplutocrat. They have served first their own capitalists and then the\r\ncapitalists and landlords of India. Some among them have tried to do a\r\nlittle for the submerged classes, the poor ryot and the ill-paid sweated\r\nlaborer, but their efforts were of no consequence. They have failed and\r\ntheir failure is writ large on the face of the ryot. We are not sanguine\r\nthat the politically minded classes when they get power will immediately\r\nrehabilitate the ryot and give him his due. We have no hope of that\r\nkind. Yet we unhesitatingly support the demand of the politically minded\r\nclasses for a responsible government in India. In our judgment, that is\r\nthe only way to raise the masses to a consciousness of their rights and\r\nresponsibilities. The experience of the West tells us that in that way\r\nand in that way alone lies salvation. Political consciousness must\r\ntravel from the classes to the masses and the longer the inauguration of\r\npopular Government is delayed, the greater the delay in the awakening of\r\nthe ryot and the working man. Absolutism must first give way and\r\ntransfer its power to the politically minded classes, then will come the\r\nturn of the masses to demand their rights and compel compliance. We can\r\nsee no risk of a greater harm or injury to the masses of India from the\r\ntransference of power from the hands of a close bureaucracy of\r\nforeigners into the hands of the educated and propertied oligarchy of\r\ntheir own countrymen. Even in countries like Great Britain, America and\r\nFrance it is the educated and the propertied classes who rule. Why then\r\nthis hubbub about the impropriety and danger of giving power to the same\r\nclasses in India? Why are the representatives of landlordism and\r\ncapitalism in the British House of Lords and among the ranks of Imperial\r\nAnglo-Indians so solicitous of the welfare of the Indian masses, when\r\nthey have for so long persistently denied justice to the proletariat of\r\ntheir own country? It is a strange phenomenon to see the champions of\r\nprivilege and status, the defenders of capitalism and landlordism, the\r\nadvocates of the rights of property, the upholders of caste in Great\r\nBritain, spending so much powder and shot to _protect_ the Indian ryot\r\nfrom the prospective exploitation of him by the Indian Brahmin and the\r\nIndian Banya[6] (the priest and the capitalist). Let the British Brahmin\r\nand the British Banya first begin by doing justice to the proletariat of\r\ntheir own country and then it will be time for them to convince the\r\nIndian of their altruism and honesty of purpose in obstructing the\r\ninauguration of responsible government in India in the interests of the\r\nIndian proletariat. In this connection the authors of the Report make\r\nsome pertinent observations which deserve to be quoted. After speaking\r\nof \"religious animosities and social cleavages\" and the duty of\r\ndiscouraging them the authors say:\r\n\r\n    \"Nor are we without hope that the reforms will themselves help to\r\n    provide the remedy. We would not be misunderstood. Representative\r\n    institutions in the West, where all are equal at the ballot box,\r\n    have checked but not abolished social exclusiveness. We do not\r\n    make a higher claim for similar institutions in India than that\r\n    they will help to soften the rigidity of the caste-system. But we\r\n    hope that these incidents of it which lead to the permanent\r\n    degradation and ostracism of the lowest castes will tend to\r\n    disappear in proportion to the acceptance of the ideas on which\r\n    the new constitution rests. There is a further point. An\r\n    autocratic administration, which does not share the religious\r\n    ideas of the people, obviously finds its sole safe ground in\r\n    leaving the whole department of traditional social usage severely\r\n    alone. In such matters as child-marriage, it is possible that\r\n    through excess of caution proper to the regime under which it\r\n    works, it may be actually perpetuating and stereotyping customs\r\n    which the better mind of India might be brought, after the\r\n    necessary period of struggle, to modify. A government, in which\r\n    Indians themselves participate, invigorated by a closer touch with\r\n    a more enlightened popular opinion, may be able with all due\r\n    caution to effect with the free assent or acquiescence of the\r\n    Indians themselves, what under the present system has to be\r\n    rigorously set aside.\"\r\n\r\nNor are the authors unmindful of the effect of free institutions on the\r\ncharacter of the people as they themselves over and over again\r\nrecognise.\r\n\r\n    \"Free institutions have, as we have said, the faculty of reacting\r\n    on the adverse conditions in which the start has to be made. The\r\n    backwardness of education may embarrass the experiment at the\r\n    outset; but it certainly ought not to stop it, because popular\r\n    government in India as elsewhere is sure to promote the\r\n    progressive spread of education and so a widening circle of\r\n    improvement will be set up.\"[7]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the authors' reasons for what they call a gradual advance they\r\nstate the following also: (a) \"We find it freely and widely admitted\r\nthat they (i.e. the Indians) are not yet ready.\" This admission may\r\nlegitimately be used against the total withdrawal of all control of\r\nIndian affairs by the Parliament. Firstly, it is questionable whether\r\nany such admission is really \"freely and widely\" made. Secondly, the\r\nadmission justifies the retention of the powers of vital, general\r\nsupervision and general control and also the retention of some Europeans\r\nin the higher services, but not the total denial of all responsibility\r\nfor maintaining law and order and of all power to control the central\r\nExecutive. (b) That the responsibility of India's defence is the\r\nultimate burden which rests on the Government of India; and this duty is\r\nthe last which can be intrusted to inexperienced or unskilful hands.\r\n\r\n    \"So long as India depends for her internal and external security\r\n    upon the army and navy of the United Kingdom, the measure of\r\n    self-determination which she enjoys must be inevitably limited. We\r\n    cannot think that Parliament would consent to the employment of\r\n    British arms in support of a policy over which it had no control\r\n    and of which it might disapprove. The defence of India is an\r\n    Imperial question: and for this reason the Government of India\r\n    must retain both the power and the means of discharging its\r\n    responsibilities for the defence of the country and to the Empire\r\n    as a whole.\"\r\n\r\nThe defence of India involves, (a) men for the army and the navy, (b)\r\nofficers, (c) war materials and war ships, (d) experts in strategy, (e)\r\nmoney. That India pays for her defense and also contributes towards the\r\ndefence of the Empire are facts which cannot be questioned. That she\r\nshall continue to do so in the future may also be assumed. That it is\r\nextremely desirable that in the matter of war supplies she should be\r\nself-dependent has been freely admitted. The permanent Indian army as\r\nconstituted in pre-war days contained two-thirds Indians and one-third\r\nBritish. If the present strength of the Indian army be examined it will\r\nbe found that the proportion of British troops is still smaller. There\r\nis absolutely no need of British soldiers in India for the purposes of\r\ndefence, but if the British Government wants to keep them as safeguards\r\nagainst mutiny among the purely Indian army or against the spirit of\r\nrebellion that at any time may exhibit itself among the Indian people,\r\nthen the British exchequer must pay for them as it did in the case of\r\nBritish garrison in South Africa or as the United States does in the\r\ncase of American troops in the Philippines. It is adding insult to\r\ninjury to argue that we should not only pay for British troops but that\r\nthe fact that British troops form a constituent element of the Indian\r\narmy should be used against us for denying us full responsibility even\r\nin civil affairs. The armies of the various Asiatic Governments\r\nsurrounding India have no European elements in them and the Indian\r\nsoldier is as efficient a fighter as is needed as a protection. That the\r\nIndian army should be almost exclusively officered by the British is a\r\nsurvival of the policy of mistrust, jealousy and racial discrimination\r\nwhich has hitherto prevailed. It is time that the Indian army should in\r\nfuture be mainly officered by the Indians. Until that is achieved it\r\nmust continue as a tentative measure to be officered by the British,\r\nand the Indian Revenues must bear the burden. But that is hardly any\r\nreason for denying us full responsible government even on the civil\r\nside. The Indians do not desire nor demand the transfer of the control\r\nover the Army or the Navy until the Army is principally officered by the\r\nIndians and an Indian Navy has been built to supplement the Imperial\r\nNavy. From this criticism of the reasons advanced by the authors for a\r\nvery mild \"advance\" (called \"gradual\") it is with pleasure that we turn\r\nto the brighter side of the picture showing the favorable features of\r\nthe situation. The position of the educated Indian is described fairly\r\nand squarely in Paragraph 140.\r\n\r\n    \"The old assumption that the interests of the ryot must be\r\n    confided to official hands is strenuously denied by modern\r\n    educated Indians. They claim that the European official must by\r\n    his lack of imagination and comparative lack of skill in tongues\r\n    be gravely handicapped in interpreting the thoughts and desires of\r\n    an Asiatic people.... Our educational policy in the past aimed at\r\n    satisfying the few, who sought after English education, without\r\n    sufficient thought of the consequences which might ensue from not\r\n    taking care to extend instruction to the many. We have in fact\r\n    created a limited _intelligentsia_, who desire advance; and we\r\n    cannot stay their progress entirely until education has been\r\n    extended to the masses. It has been made a reproach to the\r\n    educated classes that they have followed too exclusively after one\r\n    or two pursuits, the law, journalism or school teaching: and that\r\n    these are all callings which make men inclined to overrate the\r\n    importance of words and phrases. But even if there is substance in\r\n    the count, we must take note also how far the past policy of\r\n    Government is responsible. We have not succeeded in making\r\n    education practical. It is only now, when the war has revealed\r\n    the importance of industry, that we have deliberately set about\r\n    encouraging Indians to undertake the creation of wealth by\r\n    industrial enterprise, and have thereby offered the educated\r\n    classes any tangible inducement to overcome their traditional\r\n    inclination to look down on practical forms of energy. We must\r\n    admit that the educated Indian is a creation peculiarly of our\r\n    own; and if we take the credit that is due to us for his strong\r\n    points we must admit a similar liability for his weak ones. Let us\r\n    note also in justice to him that the progressive Indian appears to\r\n    realise the narrow basis of his position and is beginning to\r\n    broaden it. In municipal and university work he has taken a useful\r\n    and creditable share. We find him organising effort not for\r\n    political ends alone, but for various forms of public and social\r\n    service. He has come forward and done valuable work in relieving\r\n    famine and distress by floods, in keeping order at fairs, in\r\n    helping pilgrims, and in promoting co-operative credit. Although\r\n    his ventures in the fields of commerce have not been always\r\n    fortunate, he is beginning to turn his attention more to the\r\n    improvement of agriculture and industry. Above all, he is active\r\n    in promoting education and sanitation; and every increase in the\r\n    number of educated people adds to his influence and authority.\"\r\n\r\nThe authors also say:\r\n\r\n    \"We must remember, too, that the educated Indian has come to the\r\n    front by hard work; he has seized the education which we offered\r\n    him because he first saw its advantages; and it is he who has\r\n    advocated and worked for political progress. All this stands to\r\n    his credit. For thirty years he has developed in his Congress and\r\n    latterly in the Muslim League free popular convocations which\r\n    express his ideals. We owe him sympathy because he has conceived\r\n    and pursued the idea of managing his own affairs, an aim which no\r\n    Englishman can fail to respect. He has made a skilful, and on the\r\n    whole a moderate, use of the opportunities which we have given him\r\n    in the legislative councils of influencing Government and\r\n    affecting the course of public business, and of recent years, he\r\n    has by speeches and in the press done much to spread the idea of a\r\n    united and self-respecting India among thousands who had no such\r\n    conception in their minds. Helped by the inability of the other\r\n    classes in India to play a prominent part he has assumed the place\r\n    of leader; but his authority is by no means universally\r\n    acknowledged and may in an emergency prove weak.\"\r\n\r\nIn face of these observations about the politically minded classes of\r\nIndia it is rather unkind of the authors to insinuate later on that in\r\nthe interests of the foreign merchant, the foreign missionary and the\r\nEuropean servants of the state it is necessary that the Government of\r\nIndia should yet remain absolute and that, in the provinces as well,\r\nimportant branches of the administration should be excluded from the\r\njurisdiction of the popular assemblies.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, while we are prepared to concede that the conditions of the\r\nproblem may justify the withholding of absolute autonomy,--political,\r\nfiscal, and military,--for some time, there is nothing in them which can\r\nin any way be deemed sufficient to deny full political, and, if not\r\ncomplete, at least substantial fiscal autonomy to the Indian people at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Village Government in British India_, by JOHN MATTHAI. Preface by\r\nSIDNEY WEBB, p. xv.\r\n\r\n[2] \"The Indian Government compiles no statistics showing the\r\ndistribution of wealth, but such incomplete figures as we have obtained\r\nshow that the number of persons enjoying a substantial income is very\r\nsmall. In one province the total number of persons who enjoy an income\r\nof £66 a year derived from other sources than land is 30,000; in another\r\nprovince 20,000. The revenue and rent returns also show how small the\r\naverage agricultural holding is. According to one estimate, the number\r\nof landlords whose income derived from their proprietary holdings\r\nexceeds £20 a year in the United Provinces is about 126,000, out of a\r\npopulation of forty-eight millions. It is evident that the curve of\r\nwealth descends very steeply, and that enormous masses of the population\r\nhave little to spare for more than the necessaries of life.\"\r\n\r\n[3] See _Punjab in Peace and War_, by S.

The powers delegated to and the discretion\r\nvested in them have been so large that they could do almost anything\r\nthey liked. They could make or mar the fortunes of millions; they could\r\nfurther their happiness or add to their misery by the simple fiat of\r\ntheir will. The only limitation on their power was their own sense of\r\nduty and justice. That some of them did let themselves go is no wonder.\r\nThe wonder is that the instances of unbridled oppression and tyranny\r\nwere not more numerous than they have actually been. Speaking of the\r\nEuropean services generally, we have nothing but admiration for their\r\ngeneral character. The particular branch of the Public Services that has\r\nbeen all along entrusted with the general administration of the country\r\nis known as the Indian Civil Service. It is recruited in England and is\r\noverwhelmingly European in personnel. On April 1, 1913, only forty-six\r\nof the 1319 civilians on the _cadre_ were natives of India.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the executive organizations that have so far ruled India,\r\nthe eminent authors of the Report for the reorganization of the\r\nGovernment of India remark that it may \"well be likened to a mere system\r\nof official posts, actuated _till_ now by impulses of its own, but\r\naffected by the popular ideas which impinge on it from three\r\nsources--the British Parliament, the legislative councils and the local\r\nboards.\" The sentence would have been correct if in place of \"but\r\naffected\" the authors had said \"and affected but little.\" \"The system,\"\r\nthey add, \"has in the main depended for its effectiveness on the\r\nexperience, wisdom and energy of the services themselves. It has, for\r\nthe most part, been represented by the Indian Civil Service which,\r\nthough having little to do with the technical departments of government,\r\n_has for over 100 years in practice had the administration entrusted to\r\nits hands, because, with the exception of the offices of the Governor\r\nGeneral, Governors, and some members of the executive councils, it has\r\nheld practically all the places involving superior control_. It has been\r\nin effect much more of a government corporation than of a purely civil\r\nservice in the English sense. It has been made a reproach to the Indian\r\nCivil Service that it regards itself as the Government; but a view\r\nwhich strikes the critic familiar with parliamentary government as\r\narrogant is little more than a condensed truth.\" [The italics are ours.]\r\n\r\nThe Indian Civil Service has thus developed all the characteristics,\r\ngood and bad, of a caste. It has been a powerful bureaucracy, as\r\nexclusive, proud, arrogant and self-sufficient,--if not even more\r\nso,--as the original Brahmin oligarchy of the land, except that while\r\nthe Brahmin oligarchy had ties of race, religion and culture with the\r\nrest of the population, the Indian Civil Service is almost entirely\r\ncomposed of aliens. The ancient Brahmins were, however, kept in check by\r\nthe military caste. The mutual jealousies of these two castes afforded\r\nsome kind of protection to the people in general. But in the case of the\r\nBritish Indian Civil Service, the military have given entire support to\r\ntheir civilian fellow-countrymen and have been completely under their\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nThe Brahmins of India have left a monumental record of their labors.\r\nThey produced great thinkers, writers, legislators, administrators and\r\norganizers. In their own time they were as wise, energetic and\r\nresourceful as any bureaucracy in the world has ever been or will ever\r\nbe. Yet the system of life they devised cut at the roots of national\r\nvitality. It dried almost all the springs of corporate national life. It\r\nreduced the bulk of the population to a position of complete\r\nsubservience to their will, of blind faith in their wisdom, of absolute\r\ndependence on their initiative. It deprived the common people of all\r\nopportunities of independent thought and independent action. It brought\r\nabout a kind of national atrophy. And this, in spite of the fact that\r\nthey began by imposing a rigorous code of self-denial on themselves and\r\ntheir class. For themselves they wanted nothing but a life of poverty\r\nand asceticism. Their economic interests were never in theory or in\r\npractice in conflict with those of the rest of the body politic.\r\n\r\nA Brahmin was forbidden to engage in trade or otherwise accumulate\r\nwealth. His life was a life of strict self-abnegation. This cannot be\r\nsaid of the Indian Civil Servant. He receives a handsome salary for his\r\nservices, expects and receives periodic promotion until he reaches a\r\nposition which, from an economic point of view, is not unenviable. After\r\nretirement he is free to engage in trade and otherwise accumulate\r\nwealth. But over and above this, what distinguishes an Indian Civil\r\nServant from an old Brahmin bureaucrat is the fact that in India he\r\nrepresents a nation whose economic interest may not always be in harmony\r\nwith those of the people of India. He is thus supposed to be the\r\nguardian of the interests of his countrymen, and is expected to further\r\nthem as much as he can without altogether endangering the safety of\r\nBritish rule in India. Looked at from this angle, we have no hesitation\r\nin saying that the work of the Indian Civil Service, too, has in its\r\nway, been monumental. As a rule, they have proved capable\r\nadministrators, individually honest, hardworking and alert. They have\r\norganized and tabulated India in a way, perhaps, never done before. But\r\nafter all has been said in their praise, it cannot be denied that they\r\nhave done India even more harm than the Brahmin oligarchy in its time,\r\ndid, by the support they lent to economic exploitation of the country by\r\nmen of their own race and religion. Now, in this latter respect, we\r\nwant to guard against being misunderstood. The Indian Civil Service has,\r\nin the course of about a century, produced a fairly good number of men\r\nwho have honestly and fearlessly stood for the protection of Indian\r\ninterests against those of people of their own race and religion. In\r\ndoing so they have sometimes ruined their own prospects of promotion and\r\nadvancement. Whenever they failed in their self-imposed task, and more\r\noften they failed than not, they failed because the authorities at the\r\ntop were forced by considerations of domestic and imperial policy to do\r\notherwise. On the whole, the defects of the bureaucratic administration\r\nwere more the defects of the system than of the individuals composing\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Civil Servant, like the old Brahmin, is autocratic and\r\ndictatorial. He dislikes any display of independence by the people put\r\nunder his charge. He discourages initiative. He likes to be called and\r\nconsidered the _Mai bap_ (mother and father) of his subjects. On those\r\nwho literally consider him such he showers his favors. The others he\r\ndenounces and represses. This has, in the course of time, led to\r\nnational emasculation. That is our chief complaint against the Indian\r\nCivil Service. Of the other services we would rather not speak. They\r\nhave by no means been so pure and high-minded as the I. C. S., nor\r\nperhaps so autocratic and dictatorial. The number of men who misused\r\ntheir powers and opportunities to their own advantage has been much\r\nlarger in services other than the I. C. S. Yet they all have done a\r\ncertain amount of good work for India; whether one looks at the\r\nengineering works designed and executed by them, or the researches they\r\nhave made in the science of healing and preventing disease, or the\r\nrisks they have run in preserving order or maintaining peace one cannot\r\nbut admire their efficiency and ability. The grievances of the Indian\r\nNationalists against the Public Services in India may be thus\r\nsummarized:\r\n\r\n(_a_) That the services monopolize too much power and are practically\r\nuncontrolled by and irresponsible to the people of the country.\r\n\r\n(_b_) That the higher branches of the services contain too many\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\n(_c_) That these are recruited in England, and from some of them the\r\nIndians are altogether barred.\r\n\r\n(_d_) That even when doing the same work Indians are not paid on the\r\nsame scale as the Europeans.\r\n\r\n(_e_) That the Government has often kept on men of proved inefficiency\r\nand of inferior qualities.\r\n\r\n(_f_) That, considering the economic conditions of India, the higher\r\nservants of the Government are paid on a scale unparalleled in the\r\nhistory of public administration in the world.\r\n\r\n(_g_) That the interests of the services often supersede those of the\r\ncountry and the Government.\r\n\r\n(_h_) And last, but not least, that by the gathering of all powers of\r\ninitiative and execution in their hands they have emasculated India.\r\n\r\nAs regards (_a_) we have already quoted the opinion of the eminent\r\nauthors of the report. The principle laid down in the announcement of\r\nAugust 20, and the scheme proposed are supposed to do away with the\r\nelement of irresponsibility. It is obvious that with the introduction of\r\nthe principle of popular control into the Government, the power of\r\nindividual servants of the executive will not remain what it is now, or\r\nhas been in the past. Much that is vested in and done by the service\r\nwill be transferred to public bodies elected by popular vote. This will\r\nnaturally affect (_b_) and (_c_) also. We will here stop to quote again\r\nfrom the Report:\r\n\r\n    \"In the forefront of the announcement of August 20 the policy of\r\n    the increasing association of Indians in every branch of the\r\n    administration was definitely placed. It has not been necessary\r\n    for us, nor indeed would it have been possible, to go into this\r\n    large question in detail in the time available for our inquiry. We\r\n    have already seen that Lord Hardinge's Government was anxious to\r\n    increase the number of Indians in the public services, and that a\r\n    Royal Commission was appointed in 1912 to examine and report on\r\n    the existing limitations in the employment of Indians.... The\r\n    report was signed only a few months after the outbreak of war, and\r\n    its publication was deferred in the hope that the war would not be\r\n    prolonged. When written, it might have satisfied moderate Indian\r\n    opinion, but when published two years later it was criticised as\r\n    wholly disappointing. Our inquiry has since given us ample\r\n    opportunity of judging the importance which Indian opinion\r\n    attaches to this question. While we take account of this attitude,\r\n    a factor which carries more weight with us is that since the\r\n    report was signed an entirely new policy toward Indian government\r\n    has been adopted, which must be very largely dependent for success\r\n    on the extent to which it is found possible to introduce Indians\r\n    into every branch of the administration.\"\r\n\r\nThe authors of the Report then proceed to state the limitations of the\r\nprocess, subject to the general remark that at the present moment there\r\nare few Indians (we do not admit this) trained in public life, who can\r\nreplace the Europeans, and thus to alter the personnel of a service\r\nmust be a long and steady process. They admit that:\r\n\r\n    \"If responsible government is to be established in India there\r\n    will be a far greater need than is even dreamt of at present for\r\n    persons to take part in public affairs in the legislative\r\n    assemblies and elsewhere; and for this reason the more Indians we\r\n    can employ in the public services the better. Moreover, it would\r\n    lessen the burden of Imperial responsibilities if a body of\r\n    capable Indian administrators could be produced. We regard it as\r\n    necessary, therefore, that recruitment of a largely increased\r\n    proportion of Indians should be begun at once.\"\r\n\r\nIn the next paragraph they state why, in their judgment, it is necessary\r\nthat a substantial portion of the services must continue to be European.\r\nTheir reasons may be gathered from the following:\r\n\r\n    \"The characteristics which we have learned to associate with the\r\n    Indian public services must as far as possible be maintained and\r\n    the leaven of officers possessed of them should be strong enough\r\n    to assure and develop them in the service as a whole. The\r\n    qualities of courage, leadership, decision, fixity of purpose,\r\n    detached judgment and integrity in her public servants will be as\r\n    necessary as ever to India. There must be no such sudden swamping\r\n    of any service with any new element that its whole character\r\n    suffers a rapid alteration.\"\r\n\r\nOn these grounds they make the following recommendations:\r\n\r\n    \"I. That all distinctions based on race be removed, and that\r\n    appointments to all branches of the public service be made without\r\n    racial discrimination\" (Paragraph 315).\r\n\r\n    \"II. That for all the public services, for which there is\r\n    recruitment in England open to Europeans and Indians alike, there\r\n    must be a system of appointment in India, ... and we propose to\r\n    supplement it by fixing a definite percentage of recruitment to be\r\n    made in India.\"\r\n\r\n    \"III. We have not been able to examine the question of the\r\n    percentage of recruitment to be made in India for any service\r\n    other than the Indian Civil Service. The Commission recommended\r\n    that 25 per cent. of the superior posts of that service should be\r\n    recruited for in India. We consider that changed conditions\r\n    warrant some increase in that proportion, and we suggest that 33\r\n    per cent. of the superior posts should be recruited for in India,\r\n    and that this percentage should be increased by 1-1/2 per cent.\r\n    annually until the periodic commission is appointed which will\r\n    re-examine the whole subject.... We have dealt only with the\r\n    Indian Civil Service, but our intention is that there should be in\r\n    all other services now recruited from England a fixed percentage\r\n    of recruitment in India, increasing annually.\"\r\n\r\nNow we must admit that this is certainly a distinct and marked advance\r\non the existing situation. The Indian Constitutional party, however,\r\nwants to have the percentage of recruitment in India fixed at 50 per\r\ncent., retaining at the same time the annual increase suggested. In our\r\nopinion, this difference is not material, provided the number of posts\r\nto which the rule of percentage is to be applied is substantially\r\nreduced. We may state our position briefly.\r\n\r\nWe are of the opinion that the system of administration in India is much\r\nmore costly than it should be, considering the sources and the amounts\r\nof Indian revenues. Unless the industries of the country are developed\r\nwe can see no new sources of increased taxation. Consequently, to us,\r\nit seems essential that some economy should be effected in the various\r\ndepartments of the administration. The only way to effect that economy\r\nis to substantially reduce the number of posts on which it is considered\r\nnecessary to retain a certain percentage of Europeans. In speaking of\r\nthe machinery of the Government of India, the authors of the Report say:\r\n\r\n    \"_We think we have reason for saying that in some respects the\r\n    machinery is no longer equal to the needs of the time._ The normal\r\n    work of the departments is heavy. The collective responsibility of\r\n    the Government is weighty, especially in time of war. There is\r\n    little time or energy left for those activities of a political\r\n    nature which the new situation in the country demands. A\r\n    legislative session of the Government of India imposes a serious\r\n    strain upon the departments, and especially on the members in\r\n    charge of them. But apart from the inevitable complexities of the\r\n    moment, the growing burden of business, which results from the\r\n    changing political conditions of the country, is leading to an\r\n    accumulation of questions which cannot be disposed of as quickly\r\n    as they present themselves. We find the necessity for reforms\r\n    admitted, principles agreed upon, and decisions taken, and then\r\n    long delays in giving effect to them. Difficulties are realized,\r\n    enquiries are started, commissions report, and then there is a\r\n    pause. There is a belief abroad that assurances given in public\r\n    pronouncement of policy are sometimes not fulfilled. On this\r\n    occasion, therefore, we have taken steps to guard against such\r\n    imputations, and to provide means for ensuring the ordered\r\n    development of our plans.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENT CAUSES OF DELAY\r\n\r\n    \"267. The main fault for the clogging of the machine does not, we\r\n    think, lie altogether with its highly trained engineers. What is\r\n    chiefly wanted is some change of system in the directions of\r\n    simplicity and speed. _How does it happen that announcements are\r\n    made that arouse expectations only to defeat them?_ We know that\r\n    it is not from any intention of deluding the public. We suggest\r\n    that it is because the wheels move too slowly for the times; the\r\n    need for change is realized, but because an examination of details\r\n    would take too long, promises are made in general terms, which on\r\n    examination it becomes necessary so to qualify with reservations\r\n    as to disappoint anticipations, and even to lead to charges of\r\n    breach of faith. We suspect that a root-cause of some political\r\n    discontent lies in such delays. Now, so far as the provinces are\r\n    concerned, we believe that our proposals _for freeing them to a\r\n    great extent from the control of the Government of India and the\r\n    Secretary of State will improve matters. But the Government of\r\n    India are in the worst case_.\" [The italics are ours.]\r\n\r\nThese observations raise an apprehension in our mind that it is proposed\r\nto add to the strength of the services under the Government of India.\r\nWe, for ourselves, do not see how it can be otherwise. With the steady\r\nadmission of the popular element into the Government of India the\r\nactivities of the latter are likely to increase rather than diminish;\r\nthe secretarial work of the different departments will expand rather\r\nthan contract. The question of questions is how to meet the increased\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nThe remedy is the same as was suggested many years ago by Sir William\r\nHunter, the official historian of India. He said:\r\n\r\n\"If we are to give a really efficient administration to India, many\r\nservices must be paid for at lower rates even at present. For those\r\nrates are regulated in the higher branches of the administration by the\r\ncost of officers brought from England. You cannot work with imported\r\nlabor as cheaply as you can with native labor, and I regard the more\r\nextended employment of the natives, not only as an act of justice, but\r\nas a financial necessity. If we are to govern the Indian people\r\nefficiently and cheaply, we must govern them by means of themselves, and\r\npay for the administration at the market rates for native labor.\"\r\n\r\nNow, whatever may be said about the necessity of maintaining a strong\r\nEuropean element in the departments which require initiative, courage,\r\nresourcefulness and all the other qualities of \"leadership\" they are\r\ncertainly not a _sine qua non_ for efficiency in secretarial work. We\r\ncan see no reason why, then, the different secretariats of the\r\nGovernment of India cannot be manned mainly, if not exclusively, by\r\nIndians. Their salaries need not be the same as those now paid to the\r\nEuropeans engaged in these departments. May we ask if there is any\r\ncountry on earth where such high salaries are paid to the secretarial\r\nheads of departments as in India? Secretaries to the Government of India\r\nin the Army and Public works and Legislative departments receive 42,000\r\nRs. each ($14,000, or £2800 a year); Secretaries to the Government of\r\nIndia in the Finance, Foreign, Home, Revenue, Agriculture, Commerce and\r\nIndustry and Education departments get Rs. 48,000 a year each ($16,000\r\nor £3,200); Educational Commissioners from 30 to 36,000 Rs. ($10,000 to\r\n$12,000).\r\n\r\nThese secretarial officers are not of Cabinet rank. Besides their\r\nsalaries they get various allowances, and the purchasing value of the\r\nrupee in India is much higher than that of 33 cents in the United States\r\nor of 16d. in the United Kingdom, the exchange equivalents of an Indian\r\nrupee. The same remarks may be made about Provincial Secretariats. We do\r\nnot ignore the fact that a European who cuts himself away from his\r\ncountry and people for the best part of his life cannot be expected to\r\ngive his time, energy and talents for the compensation he might accept\r\nin his own country, nor that, if the best kind of European talent is\r\ndesired for India, the compensation must be sufficiently attractive to\r\ntempt competent men to accept it. In Paragraphs 318 to 322, both\r\ninclusive, the Secretary of India and the Viceroy have put forward a\r\nforceful plea for improvement in the conditions of the European Services\r\nby (_a_) increment in their salaries, (_b_) expediting promotions, and\r\n(_c_) grant of additional allowances, and also by bettering the\r\nprospects of pensions and leave. We are afraid the only way to obtain\r\nthe concurrence of Indian public opinion in this matter, if at all, is\r\nby restricting the number of posts which _must_ be held by Europeans.\r\nThe _cadre_ of services to which the rule of percentage is to apply must\r\nbe reduced in strength, and if Europeans are required for posts outside\r\nthese they should be employed for short periods and from an open market.\r\nFor example, it seems inconceivable to us why professional men like\r\ndoctors, engineers and professors should be recruited for permanent\r\nservice. Nor is there any reason why the recruitment should be confined\r\nto persons of British domicile. The Government of India must be run on\r\nbusiness principles. With the exception, perhaps, of the higher posts in\r\nthe I. C. S. and in the Army, all other offices should be filled by\r\ntaking the supply on the best available terms for short periods and from\r\nopen market. By reducing the number of higher posts to which the rule of\r\npercentage should apply, the Government would be reducing the number of\r\nIndian officers who could claim the same salary as is given to their\r\nEuropean colleagues. In our humble opinion, the latter claim is purely\r\nsentimental, and the best interests of the country require that the\r\nadministration should be as economical as is compatible with efficiency.\r\nThe strength of the different permanent services should be reduced as\r\nmuch as possible and the deficiency made up by the appointment of the\r\nbest persons available at the price which the administration may be\r\nwilling to pay, whether such persons be European, Indian or American.\r\nTake the Indian Educational Service, for example. The members start with\r\na salary of 6000 Rs. a year ($2000 or £400) and rise to about 24,000 Rs.\r\na year ($8000 or £1600). In the United States, to the best of our\r\nknowledge, few professors, if any, get a salary higher than $7000 or\r\n21,000 Rs. a year. High-class graduates of Harvard, Yale and Columbia\r\nstart their tutorial careers at $2000 to $3000 a year, many at $1500 a\r\nyear. These men would refuse to go to India on a similar salary. On the\r\nother hand, if a salary of $4000 to $10,000 were offered to a select\r\nfew, the services of _the men at the top_ might be had for a short\r\nperiod. Surely, in the best interests of education, it is much better to\r\nget first-class men on high salaries for short periods than permanently\r\nto have third-class men beginning with smaller salaries and eventually\r\nrising to high salaries and ensuring to themselves life long pensions.\r\nWhat is true of the Educational Service is similarly, if not equally,\r\ntrue of the Medical, the Engineering and other scientific services. At\r\nthe present time we have men in these technical services who received\r\ntheir education about twenty or twenty-five years ago and whose\r\nknowledge of their respective sciences is antiquated and rusty.\r\nApothecaries, absolutely innocent of any knowledge of modern surgery,\r\nare often appointed to the post of Civil Surgeons. No sensible Indian\r\ndesires that the present incumbents should be interfered with, except\r\nwhere it is possible to retire them under the terms of their service.\r\nAll engagements should be met honorably. What is needed is that in\r\nfuture there should be a radical departure in the practice of appointing\r\nnon-Indians to responsible posts in India. We do not want to deprive\r\nourselves of the privilege of being guided in our work by European\r\ntalent, nor should we grudge them adequate compensation for their\r\nservices. What we object to is (1) racial discrimination; (2) excessive\r\npower being vested in individual officers; (3) the employment of more\r\nthan a necessary number of persons of alien origin; (4) the crippling of\r\nthe country's resources by burdening its finances with unnecessary\r\npensions and leave allowances; (5) the continuance of men on service\r\nlists long after their usefulness has disappeared; (6) the filling of\r\nappointments by jobbery, as is now done in the so-called non-regulation\r\nprovinces. We, in the Punjab, have been \"blessed\" by the rule of several\r\ngenerations of Smiths, Harrys and Jones. Those who failed to pass the I.\r\nC. S. joined the _cadre_ by the back door and received the same\r\nemoluments as those who entered it by competition. It is they who block\r\nthe avenues of promotions and not the sons of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOST OF ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the cost of administration it will be instructive to\r\ncompare the annual salaries allowed to the highest public servants in\r\nIndia, the United States and Japan.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States, who ranks with the great royalties\r\nof the world in position, gets a salary of $75,000, without any other\r\nallowance. The Prime Minister of Japan gets 12,000 yen, or $6000. The\r\nViceroy and the Governor General of India gets 250,000 rupees, or\r\n$83,000, besides a very large amount in the shape of various allowances.\r\nThe Cabinet Ministers of the United States get a salary of $12,000 each,\r\nthe Japanese 8000 yen or $4000, and the Members of the Viceroy's\r\nCouncil, $26,700 each.\r\n\r\nIn the whole Federal Government of the United States there are only\r\nthree offices which carry a salary of more than $8000. They are:\r\n\r\n  The President of the General Navy Board     $13,500\r\n  Solicitor General                           $10,000\r\n  Assistant Solicitor General                  $9,000\r\n\r\nAll the other salaries range from $2100 to $8000. In the State\r\nDepartment all offices, including those of the secretaries, carry\r\nsalaries of from $2100 to $5000. In the Treasury Department the\r\nTreasurer gets $8000, three other officers having $6000 each. All the\r\nremaining officials get from $2500 to $5000. In the War Department there\r\nare only two offices which have a salary of $8000 attached: that of\r\nChief of Staff and that of Quartermaster General. The rest get from\r\n$2000 to $6000. In the Navy Department, besides the President of the\r\nGeneral Board mentioned above, the President of the Naval Examination\r\nBoard gets $8000 and so does the Commandant of the Marine Corps. All the\r\nrest get from $6000 downwards. In the Department of Agriculture there is\r\nonly one office carrying a salary of $6000. All the rest get from $5000\r\ndownwards. The Chief of the Weather Bureau, an expert, gets $6000. In\r\nthe Commerce Department four experts get $6000 each, the rest from $5000\r\ndownwards.\r\n\r\nIn Japan the officials of the Imperial Household have salaries ranging\r\nfrom $2750 to $4000. Officials of the Higher Civil Service get from\r\n$1850 to $2100 a year; the Vice-Minister of State, $2500; Chief of the\r\nLegislative Bureau, $2500; the Chief Secretary of the Cabinet, $2500;\r\nand the Inspector General of the Metropolitan Police, $2500; President\r\nof the Administrative Litigation Court, $3000; President of the Railway\r\nBoard, $3750; President of the Privy Council, $3000; Vice-President of\r\nthe Privy Council, $2750, and so on.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to India we find that the President of the Railway Board\r\ngets from $20,000 to $24,000 and that two other members of the Railway\r\nBoard get $16,000. Secretaries in the Army, Public Works, and\r\nLegislative Departments get $14,000. Secretaries in Finance, Foreign,\r\nHome, Revenue, Agriculture, Commerce and Industry Departments get\r\n$16,000. The Secretary in the Education Department gets $12,000; Joint\r\nSecretary, $10,000; Controller and Auditor-General, $14,000;\r\nAccountant-General, from $9,000 to $11,000; Commissioner of Salt\r\nRevenue, $10,000; Director of Post and Telegraph, from $12,000 to\r\n$14,000.\r\n\r\nAmong the officers directly under the Government of India there are only\r\na few who get salaries below $7000. Most of the others get from that sum\r\nup to $12,000.\r\n\r\nThe United States includes forty-eight States and territories. Some of\r\nthem are as large in area, if not even larger, than the several\r\nprovinces of India. The Governors of these States are paid from $2500 to\r\n$12,000 a year. Illinois is the only State paying $12,000; five States,\r\nincluding New York and California, pay $10,000; two, Massachusetts and\r\nIndiana, pay $8000; one pays $7000, and three pay $6000. All the rest\r\npay $5000 or less. There is only one territory, the Philippines, which\r\npays a salary of $20,000 to its Governor-General.\r\n\r\nIn India the Governors of Madras, Bombay and Bengal each receive\r\n$40,000, besides a large amount for allowances. The Lieutenant-Governors\r\nof the Punjab, the United Provinces, Bihar and Burma get $33,000 each,\r\nbesides allowances. The Chief Commissioners receive $11,000 in Bihar,\r\n$18,700 in Assam, $20,700 in the Central Provinces, and $12,000 in\r\nDelhi. The Political Residents in the native States receive from $11,000\r\nto $16,000, besides allowances.\r\n\r\nIn Japan the governors of provinces are paid from $1850 to $2250 per\r\nyear, besides allowances varying from $200 to $300.\r\n\r\nThe Provincial services in India are paid on a more lavish scale than\r\nanywhere else in the world. In Bengal the salaries range from $1600 for\r\nAssistant Magistrate and Collector to $21,333 to Members of the\r\nCouncil, and this same extravagance is also true of the other provinces.\r\n\r\nComing to the Judiciary, we find that Justices of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States get a salary of $14,500 each, the Chief Justice\r\ngetting $15,000; the Circuit Judges get a salary of $7000 each; the\r\nDistrict Judges, $6000. In the State of New York the Judges of the\r\nSupreme Court, belonging to the General Sessions, get from $17,500 and\r\nthose of the Special Sessions from $9000 to $10,000 each. City\r\nMagistrates get from $7000 to $8000. In India the Chief Justice of\r\nBengal gets $24,000; the Chief Justices of Bombay, Madras and the United\r\nProvinces, $20,000 each. The Chief Judges of the Chief Court of the\r\nPunjab and Burma get $16,000 each and the Puisine Judges of the High\r\nCourts the same amounts.\r\n\r\nThe Puisine Judges of the Chief Courts receive $14,000. In the Province\r\nof Bengal the salaries of the District and Session Judges range from\r\n$8,000 to $12,000. District Judges of the other provinces get from about\r\n$7000 to $12,000. The Deputy Commissioners in India get a salary in the\r\ndifferent provinces ranging from $6000 to $9000 a year. The\r\nCommissioners get from $10,000 to $12,000.\r\n\r\nIn Japan the Appeal Court Judges and Procurators get from $900 to $2500\r\na year. Only one officer, the President of the Court of Causation, gets\r\nas much as $3000. The District Court Judges and Procurators are paid at\r\nthe rate of from $375 to $1850. It is needless to compare the salaries\r\nof minor officials in the three countries. Since the Indian taxpayer has\r\nto pay so heavily for the European services engaged in the work of\r\nadministration, it is necessary that even Indian officers should be paid\r\non a comparatively high scale, thus raising the cost of administration\r\nhugely and affecting most injuriously the condition of the men in the\r\nlower grades of the government service. The difference between the\r\nsalaries of the officers and the men forming the rank and file of the\r\ngovernment in the three countries shows clearly how the lowest ranks in\r\nIndia suffer from the fact that the highest governmental officials are\r\npaid at such high rates.\r\n\r\nIn New York City the Chief Inspector gets $3500 a year; Captains, $2750;\r\nLieutenants, $2250; Surgeons, $1,750; and Patrolmen, $1,400 each. In\r\nJapan the Inspector General of the Metropolitan Police gets $2500. The\r\nfigures of the lower officials are not available. But the minimum salary\r\nof a Constable is $6.50 a month, besides which he gets his equipment,\r\nuniform and boots free. In India the Inspectors General get from $8000\r\nto $12,000, the Deputy Inspectors General from $6000 to $7200, District\r\nSuperintendents of Police from $2666 to $4800, Assistants from $1200 to\r\n$2000, Inspectors from $600 to $1000, Sub-inspectors from $200 to $400,\r\nHead Constables from $60 to $80, Constables from $40 to $48.\r\n\r\nWe have taken these figures from the _Indian Year Book_, published by\r\nthe _Times of India_, Bombay. We know as a fact that the\r\nPolice-Constables in the Punjab are paid from $2.67 to $3.33 per\r\nmonth--that is, from $32 to $40 per year. The reader should mark the\r\ndifference between the grades of salaries from the highest to the lowest\r\nin India as compared with the United States and Japan. While in India\r\nthe lowest officials are frightfully underpaid, the highest grades are\r\npaid on a lavish scale. In the other countries of the world this is not\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATIONAL DEPARTMENT\r\n\r\nIn the United States (we quote the figures of New York) the lowest grade\r\nschool teachers get a salary of $720, rising to $1500 a year. In the\r\nupper grades salaries range from $1820 to $2260. Principals of\r\nelementary schools receive $3500 and assistants $2500. In the High\r\nSchools salaries range from $900 to $3150, in training schools from\r\n$1000 to $3250. Principals of High Schools and Training Schools receive\r\n$5000 and the same salary is paid to the District Superintendent. The\r\nCommissioner of Education in New York gets $7500.\r\n\r\nIn Japan the Minister of Education, who is a Cabinet Minister, gets\r\n$4000, and the lowest salaries paid to teachers range from $8 to $9 per\r\nmonth. In the United States College Professors make from $3000 to $5000\r\nper year, a few only getting higher sums. In Japan salaries range from\r\n$300 to $2000. Coming to India we find that while the Administrative\r\nofficials and even the College Professors get fairly high salaries, the\r\nteachers in the schools are miserably underpaid.\r\n\r\nEven the _Times of India_, an Anglo-Indian newspaper published in\r\nBombay, has recently commented on the colossal difference between the\r\nsalaries allowed at the top and those allowed at the bottom.

It is an\r\n    ideal of a world in which force and brutality reign supreme, as\r\n    against a world, an ideal of a world, peopled by free democracies,\r\n    united in an honourable league of peace.\r\n\r\n                                              DAVID LLOYD GEORGE\r\n\r\n                        \"The Destruction of a False Ideal.\" Speech\r\n                        delivered at the Albert Hall on the launching\r\n                        of the New War Economy Campaign, October 22,\r\n                        1917.\r\n\r\n    When the Indian troops first arrived in October, 1914, the\r\n    situation was of so drastic a nature that it was necessary to call\r\n    upon them at once to re-enforce the fighting front and help to stem\r\n    the great German thrust. Their fine fighting qualities, tenacity,\r\n    and endurance were well manifested during the first Battle of Ypres\r\n    before they had been able to completely reorganize after their\r\n    voyage from India.\r\n\r\n                                              LORD FRENCH, the First\r\n                                              Commander-in-Chief of\r\n                                              British forces on the\r\n                                              Western front.\r\n\r\n    The full story of the Palestine victory still remained to be told,\r\n    BUT WHEN THE RECORD OF THAT GLORIOUS CAMPAIGN WAS UNFOLDED, ACROSS\r\n    THE PAGE OF HISTORY WOULD BE WRIT LARGE THE NAME OF INDIA.\r\n\r\n                                              LORD CHELMSFORD, the\r\n                                              Governor-General of India,\r\n                                              on September 26, 1918.\r\n\r\n    As is usual in our history, we have triumphed after many sad\r\n    blunders and in the end we have defeated Turkey almost\r\n    single-handed, though our main forces have throughout the war been\r\n    engaged with another foe. In fact, IT IS TO INDIA THAT OUR RECENT\r\n    VICTORY IS DUE....\r\n\r\n                                              MAJOR GENERAL SIR\r\n                                              FREDERICK MAURICE in\r\n                                              _The New York Times_,\r\n                                              November 6, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present Governor of the Punjab (his precise designation is\r\nLieutenant Governor), who is the most reactionary, self-complacent and\r\nconceited of all the provincial rulers of India, has in the course of\r\nhis appeals for recruits for the present war said more than once that\r\nthe right of self-government carries with it the responsibility of\r\ndefending the country. The distinguished authors of the Report have also\r\nremarked in one place that so long as the duty of defending India rests\r\non Great Britain, the British Parliament must control the Government of\r\nIndia. Now let us see what the facts are.\r\n\r\n(1) The first thing to be remembered in this connection is that during\r\nthe whole period of British rule in India, not a penny has been spent by\r\nGreat Britain for Indian defence. The defence of India has been well\r\nprovided for by Indian Revenues. On the other hand India has paid\r\nmillions in helping Great Britain not only in defending the Empire, but\r\nin extending it.[1] Whatever protection has been afforded to India by\r\nthe British Navy--and that has by no means been small--has been more\r\nthan repaid by India's services to the Empire in China, Egypt, South\r\nAfrica and other parts of the world. As to the military forces of India,\r\nthey consist of two wings: (_a_) the British and (_b_) the Indian. The\r\npre-war Indian army consisted of 80,000 British and 160,000 Indians.\r\nIndian public opinion has for decades been protesting against the denial\r\nto Indians of officers' commissions in the Indian army, as also against\r\nthe strength of the British element therein. Every British unit of the\r\nIndian army from the Field Marshal to the Tommy is paid for his services\r\nby India. India pays for these services not only during the time they\r\nform part of the Indian army but also for their training and equipment.\r\nIt pays all their leave, transfer and pension charges. It even pays for\r\nwhatever provision is made in England for their medical relief, etc. In\r\nthe line of the military and naval defence of India, Great Britain has\r\nnot done as much for India as she has done for the dominions and\r\nself-governing colonies. Under the circumstances it is adding insult to\r\ninjury to insinuate that India has in any way shirked the duty of\r\nproviding for her defence. We will say nothing of India's services\r\nduring the war.\r\n\r\nIn the military defence of India, the contribution of the Punjab has\r\nalways been the greatest. If the British provinces are considered\r\nsingly, it will be found that the Punjab has been supplying the largest\r\nnumber of units for the Indian army, not only in the ranks of the\r\nfighters, but also in the ranks of auxiliaries. During this war, too,\r\nthe Punjab made the largest contribution of both combatants and\r\nnon-combatants. Yet, if we compare the civil status of the people of the\r\nPunjab with that of other provinces, we will find that they have been\r\npersistently denied equality of status with Bengal, Bombay and Madras.\r\nThe Punjab peasantry, which supplies the largest number of soldiers to\r\nthe army, is the most illiterate and ignorant of all the classes of\r\nIndian population. Their economic and legal position may better be\r\nstudied in Mr. Thorborn's _The Punjab in Peace and in War_. The\r\nMunicipal and Local Boards of the province do not possess as much\r\nindependence as has been conceded in the other provinces. The judicial\r\nadministration of the province is as antiquated as it could possibly be\r\nunder British rule. Instead of a High Court we have still a Chief\r\ncourt.[2] Captains and Majors and Colonels are still performing judicial\r\nfunctions as magistrates and judges. The trial by jury in the cases of\r\nIndians is unknown. Until lately the Punjab was stamped with the badge\r\nof inferiority by being called a non-Regulation province. Even in this\r\nreport the Secretary of State for India and the Viceroy have spoken of\r\nit as a backward province. It will thus be seen that the contribution of\r\nthe Punjab to the military strength of the Empire has in no way\r\nbenefited her population in getting better opportunities for civil\r\nprogress or greater civil liberties. But recently the President of the\r\nPunjab Provincial Conference uttered hard words against the Provincial\r\nadministration's policy of repression and coercion. He said that their\r\n\"cup of disappointment, discontent and misery, in the Punjab, at any\r\nrate, was full to overflowing.\"\r\n\r\nSo much about the discharge of obligations for military defence carrying\r\nwith it the right of self-government. The Indians have no desire to\r\nshirk their responsibility for the military defence of India; nor do\r\nthey want to balk their contribution to the Imperial defence. Their\r\ndemands in this respect may be thus summarised:\r\n\r\n    (1) That the Indian Army should be mainly officered by the\r\n    Indians.\r\n\r\n    (2) That as much as is possible of the arms and ammunition\r\n    equipment, and the military stores required for the Indian army be\r\n    produced in India.\r\n\r\n    (3) That the strength of the British element be considerably\r\n    reduced.\r\n\r\n    (4) That the nature of the Indian army, which is at present one of\r\n    hired soldiers, be converted into that of a National Militia with\r\n    a small standing army and a great reserve.\r\n\r\n    (5) That in order to do it, some kind of compulsory military\r\n    training be introduced. All young men between the ages of 17 and\r\n    21 may be required to undergo military training and put in at\r\n    least one year of military service.\r\n\r\n    (6) That as a preliminary step towards it the existing Arms Act be\r\n    repealed and, under proper safeguards, the people be allowed to\r\n    carry and possess arms in peace and war, so as to be familiar with\r\n    their use.\r\n\r\n    (7) That slowly and gradually, as funds can be spared from the\r\n    other demands more urgent and pressing, an Indian Navy be built.\r\n\r\nHaving explained the position of the Indian Nationalist in this matter,\r\nwe will now see what Mr. Montagu and Lord Chelmsford say on this matter\r\nin their report. In Paragraph 328 they state the \"Indian wishes\" and\r\npoint out that \"for some years Indian politicians have been urging the\r\nright of Indians in general to bear arms in defence of their country\";\r\nand that \"we have everywhere met a general demand from the political\r\nleaders for extended opportunities for military service,\" but that the\r\nsubject being more or less outside the scope of their enquiry and\r\n\"requirements of the future\" being dependent \"on the form of peace which\r\nis attained,\" they \"leave this question for consideration hereafter with\r\nthe note that it must be faced and settled.\"\r\n\r\nIn Paragraph 330 they deal with the question of \"British Commissions for\r\nIndians.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The announcement of his Majesty's Government that 'the bar which\r\n    has hitherto prevented the admission of Indians to commissioned\r\n    rank in His Majesty's Army should be removed' has established the\r\n    principle that the Indian soldier can earn the King's commission\r\n    by his military conduct. It is not enough merely to assert a\r\n    principle. We must act on it. The services of the Indian army in\r\n    the war and the great increase in its numbers make it necessary\r\n    that a considerable number of commissions should now be given. The\r\n    appointments made so far have been few. Other methods of\r\n    appointment have not yet been decided on, but we are impressed\r\n    with the necessity of grappling with the problem. We also wish to\r\n    establish the principle that if an Indian is enlisted as a private\r\n    in a British unit of His Majesty's Army its commissioned ranks\r\n    also should be open to him.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"other methods of appointment\" that have been announced since the\r\nreport was signed are far from satisfactory. It has been said that the\r\nresponsibility for this niggardly policy in the matter of admitting\r\nIndians to the Commissioned ranks of the army rests with the Home\r\nGovernment and that the Indian Government's recommendations were much\r\nmore liberal. Now, as practical men, we fully realize that for some time\r\nto come, at least until British suspicion of India's desire to get out\r\nof the Empire is completely removed by the grant of responsible\r\ngovernment to India, India's military policy and the Indian army must be\r\ncontrolled by the British executive. On that point all the parties in\r\nIndia are agreed. But it is absolutely necessary that some steps be at\r\nonce taken to remove the stigma of military helplessness from India's\r\nforehead. Let the British retain the control and the command, but let us\r\nshare the responsibility to some extent and let our young men be trained\r\nfor the future defence of their Motherland. To deprive them of all means\r\nof doing that, to charge them with neglect of that paramount duty and\r\nthen to urge it as a disqualification of civil liberties, is hardly\r\nfair.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] See chapter on \"How India has helped England make her Empire,\" in\r\n_England's Debt to India_, by the present author.\r\n\r\n[2] It has now been converted into a High Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY IN INDIA\r\n\r\n    The old world, at least, believed in ideals. It believed that\r\n    justice, fair play, liberty, righteousness must triumph in the\r\n    end; that is, however you interpret the phrase, the old world\r\n    believed in God, and it staked its existence on that belief.\r\n    Millions of gallant young men volunteered to die for that divine\r\n    faith. But if wrong emerged triumphant out of this conflict, the\r\n    new world would feel in its soul that brute force alone counted in\r\n    the government of man; and the hopelessness of the dark ages would\r\n    once more fall on the earth like a cloud.\r\n\r\n                                              DAVID LLOYD GEORGE\r\n\r\n                        \"No Halfway House.\" Speech delivered at Gray's\r\n                        Inn, December 14, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nA whole section of the Report has been devoted to a consideration of the\r\nclaims of the European Community in India. It is said:\r\n\r\n    \"We cannot conclude without taking into due account the presence\r\n    of a considerable community of non-official Europeans in India. In\r\n    the main they are engaged in commercial enterprises; but besides\r\n    these are the missions, European and American, which in furthering\r\n    education, building up character, and inculcating healthier\r\n    domestic habits have done work for which India should be grateful.\r\n    There are also an appreciable number of retired officers and\r\n    others whose working life has been given to India, settled in the\r\n    cooler parts of the country. When complaints are rife that\r\n    European commercial interests are selfish and drain the country of\r\n    wealth which it ought to retain, it _is well to remind ourselves\r\n    how much of India's material prosperity is due to European\r\n    commerce_.\" [The italics are ours].\r\n\r\nWe have no desire to raise a controversy over the assumption which\r\nunderlies the last statement in the above extract. The authors are\r\nthemselves cognizant of it when they remark, later on, that the\r\n\"benefit\" which India has received by her commercial development in\r\nEuropean hands is \"not less because it was incidental and not the\r\npurpose of the undertaking.\" These are matters on which the Indian\r\nNationalist may well hold his own opinion and yet endorse the spirit of\r\nthe following observations:\r\n\r\n    \"Clearly it is the duty of British Commerce in India to identify\r\n    itself with the interests of India, which are higher than the\r\n    interests of any community; to take part in political life; to use\r\n    its considerable wealth and opportunities to commend itself to\r\n    India; and having demonstrated both its value and its good\r\n    intentions, to be content to rest like other industries on the new\r\n    foundation of Government in the wishes of the people. No less is\r\n    it the wish of Indian politicians to respect the expectations\r\n    which have been implicitly held out; to remember how India has\r\n    profited by commercial development which only British capital and\r\n    enterprise achieved; to bethink themselves that though the capital\r\n    invested in private enterprises was not borrowed under any\r\n    assurance that the existing form of government would endure, yet\r\n    the favourable terms on which money was obtained for India's\r\n    development were undoubtedly affected by the fact of British rule;\r\n    and to abstain from advocating differential treatment aimed not so\r\n    much at promoting Indian as at injuring British commerce.\"\r\n\r\nWe must say that the last insinuation is perfectly gratuitous. Nor is it\r\ncorrect to say even by implication that the non-official European\r\ncommunity has hitherto abstained from taking part in politics. The fact\r\nis that Indian politics have hitherto been too greatly dominated by the\r\nBritish merchant both at home and in India. The British merchant doing\r\nbusiness in India had to submit to the prior claims of the British\r\nmanufacturers in Great Britain in matters in which their interests did\r\nnot coincide, but otherwise their interests received the greatest\r\npossible attention from the Government of India. In proportion to their\r\nincomes derived from India by the employment of Indian labour on terms\r\nmore or less guaranteed to them by the Indian Government's special\r\nlegislation they have made the smallest possible contribution to the\r\nIndian Revenues; yet they have been the greatest possible hindrance in\r\nthe development of Indian liberties. They have all the time owned a\r\npowerful press which has employed all the resources of education and\r\nenlightenment, all the powers of manipulating facts and figures in\r\nmaintaining and strengthening the rule of autocracy in the country. We\r\ndo not propose to open these wounds. But we cannot help remarking that\r\nso far they have exercised quite a disproportionate influence in the\r\ndecisions of the Government of India. Those of them who are domiciled in\r\nthe country are our brothers and no Indian has the least desire to do\r\nanything that will harm them in any way. Their importance must, in\r\nfuture, be determined not by their race or colour or creed but by their\r\nnumbers, their education and their position in the economic life of the\r\ncountry. They must no longer lord it over the Indians simply because\r\nthey are of European descent. They should claim no preferences or\r\nexemptions because of that fact. As an integral part of the Indian body\r\npolitic they are entitled to all the consideration which they deserve by\r\nvirtue of their intellectual or economic position. They should\r\nhenceforth be Indo-British both in spirit and in name. They will find\r\nthe Indians quite ready to forget the past and embrace them as brothers\r\nfor the common prosperity of their joint country.\r\n\r\nAs regards the other European merchants who are not domiciled in India\r\nbut are there just to make money and return to spend it in their native\r\nland, they are no more entitled to any place in the political machinery\r\nof the Indian Government than the Hindus who trade in the United States\r\nor in England. So far every European, of whatever nationality he might\r\nbe, has occupied a position of privilege in India. He was granted rights\r\nwhich were denied to the sons of the soil. Every German or Austrian or\r\nBulgarian could keep or carry any number and kind of arms he wanted\r\nwithout any license, while the natives of India, even of the highest\r\nposition, could not do so unless exempted either by virtue of their rank\r\nor by the favour of the Administration. Jews and Armenians, Turks and\r\nRussians, Scandinavians, Danes, Italians and Swiss all enjoyed the\r\nprivilege. When charged with any serious offence punishable by\r\nimprisonment for more than six months, they could claim trial by a jury\r\nhaving a majority of Europeans on it, while no Indian outside the\r\nPresidency towns of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras had that right. Even\r\nthere, the jury trying an Indian could include a majority of Europeans.\r\nIn the famous trial of Mr. B. G. Tilak in 1908, the jury was composed of\r\nseven Europeans and two Parsees. It is obvious that these\r\ndiscriminations in favour of the Europeans must cease and that no\r\nEuropean not domiciled in India should enjoy a position of special\r\nprivilege. Indians are noted for their hospitality and chivalry. Their\r\nown codes of honor effectively prevent them from doing any harm or\r\ninjury to a foreigner. Every European doing business in India or on any\r\nother errand is a guest of honor and entitled to that treatment,\r\nprovided he does not assume racial superiority and look down upon the\r\npeople of the country and take advantage of their being subjects of a\r\nEuropean power. No Indian will be so foolish as to injure the commercial\r\ndevelopment of his country by scaring the foreign trader or the foreign\r\ncapitalist. All that he wants is freedom to lay down the terms on which\r\nthat trade will be carried on consistently with the interests of India's\r\nmillions. What he stands for is equality and reciprocity. As other\r\npeoples are free to name the conditions on which the foreign trader may\r\ndo business in their countries, so must the Indians be. Nothing more and\r\nnothing less than this is demanded.\r\n\r\nAs regards the citizens of the British Empire also, the same right of\r\nreciprocity is demanded. We are glad that the representatives of the\r\nDominions have recognized the justice of that claim and expressed their\r\nwillingness to concede it.\r\n\r\nComing to the Missions, European and American, the advice given is\r\nrather gratuitous. The Indians have left nothing undone to show their\r\ngratitude to them for the good work done by them in spite of the fact\r\nthat they, too, in the past, have not hesitated to use the fact of their\r\nrace and colour for the benefit of their propaganda. The person of a\r\nreligious man is sacred in the eyes of an Indian, regardless of his\r\nparticular creed. The Christian missionary has so far enjoyed a unique\r\nposition of safety and freedom in the country even to a greater extent\r\nthan the Hindu or the Moslem priest. The latter have often quarrelled\r\namongst themselves, but the former they have always respected and\r\nhonored. There is absolutely no reason to think that this is likely to\r\nchange in any way by the grant of political liberty to the Indians.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, however, that, with the growth of free thought in India,\r\nreligious teachers of all denominations may not continue to be the\r\nrecipients of the same honour as has been paid to them in the past by\r\nvirtue of their religious office. Dogmatic religion, whether it be\r\nHinduism, Mohammedanism or Christianity is in a state of decay. In that\r\nrespect India is feeling the reaction of world forces and no amount of\r\npolitical coercion or repression can stop it. In my humble judgment the\r\naverage Indian has thus far been more tolerant of and more considerate\r\nto the Christian missionary than the latter has been to the Indian. Even\r\nin the matter of gratitude the Christian missionary may with advantage\r\nlearn from the Hindu. The instances are not rare in which all the\r\nhospitality, respect and honor which a Christian missionary has\r\nreceived during his stay in India have been repaid by the latter's\r\nfreely traducing the character of the Indians in his home land. To no\r\nsmall degree is the Christian missionary responsible for the feeling of\r\ncontempt with which the Indian is looked down upon in America and other\r\ncountries of the West. We do not object to his speaking the truth, but\r\nit is not the truth that he always speaks. Of gratitude, at least, he\r\ngives no evidence.\r\n\r\n    The European Community in India is divided into two classes: (a)\r\n    pure Europeans, who number a little less than 200,000 in the total\r\n    population of 315,000,000. (178,908 in the British provinces and\r\n    20,868 in the native States.)\r\n\r\n    (b) Anglo-Indians, hitherto called Eurasians, who number about\r\n    83,000 (68,612 in British territories and 15,045 in the Native\r\n    States). Thus the whole European community in India is less than\r\n    300,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE NATIVE STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Native States of India constitute one of the anomalies of Indian\r\npolitical life. They are the honored remnants of the old order of\r\nthings--an order in which personal bravery, resourcefulness and\r\nleadership with or without capacity for successful intrigue enabled\r\nindividuals to carve out kingdoms and principalities for themselves and\r\ntheir legal successors.\r\n\r\nIn the case of some of these Native States the genealogies of the ruling\r\nhouses go back to the early centuries of the Christian era by historical\r\nevidence and to pre-Christian times by tradition. Their origin is\r\nsomewhat shrouded in mystery. In popular belief they are the descendants\r\nof gods--gods of light and life, the Sun and the Moon. Next to the Royal\r\nfamily of Japan, they are perhaps the only houses among the rulers of\r\nthe earth which can claim such an ancient and unbroken lineage of\r\nroyalty with sovereignty of one kind or another always vested in them.\r\nThere have been times in their history when the royal heads of these\r\nstates had no house to live in and no bed to sleep on, much less a\r\nterritory to rule and an army to command. This was, however, a part of\r\ntheir royalty. In struggles against powerful enemies, sometimes of their\r\nown race and religion, but more often foreign aggressors of different\r\nblood and creed, they were many a time worsted and driven to extreme\r\nstraits of poverty and helplessness. In peace or in war, in prosperity\r\nor in misery, they never gave up the struggle. Their right to lead their\r\npeople and to rule their country they never yielded for a moment. It is\r\ntrue that sometimes they submitted to the superior power of the enemy\r\nand accepted a position of subordination, though in one case, at least,\r\neven this was done only for a short time under the Moguls. In the darker\r\ndays of Indian history, when the military devastation of foreign\r\ninvaders left nothing but tears and blood, ruin and ashes, defeat and\r\nmisery in their track, these houses kept the lamp of hope burning. For\r\nfull ten centuries they carried on a struggle of life and death,\r\nsometimes momentarily succumbing before the overwhelming force of their\r\nadversaries, but only to rise again in fresh vigor and life to reclaim\r\ntheir heritage and preserve their own and their country's independence.\r\n\r\nThe _Sessodias_ of Mewar called the _Ranas_ of Mewar (Udaipur) and the\r\nRahtores of Marwar (including Jodhpur, Bikaner, Rutlam, Kishangarh and\r\nAlwar) have written many a glorious page of Mediaeval Indian history and\r\ndyed it with their own blood as well as that of their adversaries. Not\r\nonly their men but their women have made themselves immortal by their\r\nbravery, chivalry, purity and self-immolation. The one thing which\r\ndistinguishes the Indian Rajput from the peoples of other lands is that\r\nhe has never waged war against the poor, the helpless and the\r\ndefenceless. Numberless men gave their lives freely and ungrudgingly not\r\nonly in protecting the lives of their own women and children but also in\r\ndoing the same service to the women and children of their enemies. The\r\nRajput never fought an unfair fight. He never took advantage of the\r\nhelplessness of his enemy and always gave him right of way and the use\r\nof his best weapons for a free and fair fight in the open. Anyone\r\ndesirous of knowing their deeds may read them in that poem in prose,\r\nknown as the Annals of Rajhasthan by Col. Todd. Col. Todd has drawn a\r\nmost faithful and thrilling picture of Rajput bravery and Rajput\r\nchivalry in a language worthy of the best traditions of English\r\nliterature. Here and there in matters of minor details his authority has\r\nbeen questioned; otherwise the results of his monumental labors still\r\nremain the best picture of Rajput India. The Rajput States of India are\r\nthus the objects of reverent honor to the 220 million Hindus of that\r\ncountry. Next to the Rajput States comes the native ruling family of\r\nMysore as the representative of a very ancient Hindu Kingdom. The\r\nMahratta States are the remnants of the Mahratta Empire and the Sikhs\r\nthose of the Sikh Commonwealth. The biggest of all the Indian Native\r\nStates, Hyderabad, arose out of the ruins of the Mogul Empire and is\r\nsupposed to be the most powerful guardian of Moslem culture and\r\ntradition. From this description the reader will at once see why the\r\nNative States are so dear to the peoples of India and why the Indian\r\neducated party has always stood by the Native States, whenever either\r\ntheir treaty rights or the personal dignity and status of their chiefs\r\nwas threatened by the British authorities. Lord Dalhousie's policy of\r\nannexation by lapse was so much resented by the people of India that it\r\nhad almost cost the British their Indian Empire. Only in the Native\r\nStates do the Indians see remaining traces of their former\r\nindependence. That fact alone covers all the defects of native rule or\r\nmisrule in the States, in their eyes. Some of these Native States have\r\nbeen so well administered that in education, social reform and\r\nindustrial advancement they are far ahead of the neighboring British\r\nterritories. But their chief merit lies in the fact that ordinarily the\r\npeople get enough food to eat and are seemingly happier than British\r\nsubjects. This fact has been noticed by several competent observers of\r\ncontemporary Indian life, among them the Right Honorable Mr. Fisher,\r\nPresident of the Board of Education in England. In his book _The Empire\r\nand the Future_ he has observed:\r\n\r\n    \"My impression is that the inhabitants of a well governed native\r\n    state are on the whole happier and more contented than the\r\n    inhabitants of British India. _They are more lightly taxed_; the\r\n    pace of the administration is less urgent and exacting; their\r\n    sentiment is gratified by the splendor of a native court and by\r\n    the dominion of an Indian government. They feel that they do\r\n    things for themselves instead of having everything done for them\r\n    by a cold and alien benevolence.\" (Italics are ours)\r\n\r\nBut after all that is favourable to the Native States of India has been\r\nsaid, their existence in their present form remains a political anomaly.\r\nAs at present situated, they are an effective hindrance to complete\r\nIndian unity. Although \"India is in fact as well as by legal definition,\r\none geographical whole,\" yet these Native States, occupying about\r\none-third of the total area of the country and with a population of\r\nabout 70 million will, for a long time, prevent its becoming a\r\nhomogeneous political whole. Thus a circumstance which was hitherto\r\nlooked upon as a piece of good luck will operate as a misfortune.\r\n\r\n    \"The Native States of India are about 700 in number. They embrace\r\n    the widest variety of country and jurisdiction. They vary in size\r\n    from petty States like Rewa, in Rajputana, with an area of 19\r\n    square miles, and the Simla Hill States, which are little more\r\n    than small holdings, to States like Hyderabad, as large as Italy,\r\n    with a population of thirteen millions.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe general position as regards the rights and obligations of the Native\r\nStates has been thus summed up by the distinguished authors of the joint\r\nReport (Lord Chelmsford and Mr. Montagu):\r\n\r\n    \"The States are guaranteed security from without; the paramount\r\n    power acts for them in relation to foreign powers and other\r\n    States, and it intervenes when the internal peace of their\r\n    territories is seriously threatened. On the other hand the States'\r\n    relations to foreign powers are those of the paramount power; they\r\n    share the obligation for the common defence; and they are under a\r\n    general responsibility for the good government and welfare of\r\n    their territories.\"\r\n\r\nAs regards the assimilation of the principles of modern life, it is\r\nremarked in the same document:\r\n\r\n    \"Many of them have adopted our civil and criminal codes. Some have\r\n    imitated and even further extended our educational system.... They\r\n    have not all been equally able to assimilate new principles. They\r\n    are in all stages of development, patriarchal, feudal or more\r\n    advanced, while in a few states are found the beginnings of\r\n    representative institutions. The characteristic features of all of\r\n    them, however, including the most advanced, are the personal rule\r\n    of the Prince and his control over legislation and the\r\n    administration of justice.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances the question of questions is how these\r\nterritories are going to fall into line with the British controlled area\r\nin the matter of the development of responsible Government. We will once\r\nmore quote the opinion of the Secretary of State for India and the\r\nViceroy, who say:\r\n\r\n    \"We know that the States cannot be unaffected by constitutional\r\n    development in adjoining provinces. Some of the more enlightened\r\n    and thoughtful of the Princes, among whom are included some of the\r\n    best known names, have realised this truth, and have themselves\r\n    raised the question of their own share in any scheme of reform.\r\n    Others of the Princes--again including some of the most honored\r\n    names--desire only to leave matters as they are. We feel the need\r\n    for caution in this matter. It would be a strange reward for\r\n    loyalty and devotion to force new ideas upon those who did not\r\n    desire them; but it would be no less strange, if out of\r\n    consideration for those who perhaps represent gradually vanishing\r\n    ideas, we were to refuse to consider the suggestions of others who\r\n    have been no less loyal and devoted. Looking ahead to the future\r\n    we can picture India to ourselves only as presenting the external\r\n    semblance to some form of 'federation.' The provinces will\r\n    ultimately become self-governing units, held together by the\r\n    central Government which will deal solely with matters of common\r\n    concern to all of them. But the matters common to the British\r\n    provinces are also to a great extent those in which the Native\r\n    States are interested--defence, tariffs, exchange, opium, salt,\r\n    railways and posts and telegraphs. The gradual concentration of\r\n    the Government of India upon such matters will therefore make it\r\n    easier for the States, while retaining the autonomy which they\r\n    cherish in internal matters, to enter into closer association with\r\n    the central Government if they wish to do so. But though we have\r\n    no hesitation in forecasting such a development as possible, the\r\n    last thing that we desire is to attempt to force the pace.\r\n    Influences are at work which need no artificial stimulation. All\r\n    that we need or can do is to open the door to the natural\r\n    developments of the future.\"\r\n\r\nIn Paragraphs 302 to 305 the authors of the Report state the process by\r\nwhich this development may be expedited. Disavowing any intention of\r\nforcibly altering treaty rights, they propose to classify the States\r\ninto (_a_) those that have \"full authority over their internal affairs,\"\r\n(_b_) those \"in which Government exercises through its Agents large\r\npowers of internal control,\" (_c_) those who are really no more \"than\r\nmere owners of a few acres of land.\" It is further pointed out that\r\nhitherto the\r\n\r\n    \"general clause which occurs in many of the treaties to the effect\r\n    that the Chief shall remain absolute Ruler of his country has not\r\n    in the past precluded and does not even now preclude 'interference\r\n    with the administration by Government through the agency of its\r\n    representatives at the Native Courts.' We need hardly say that\r\n    such interference has not been employed in wanton disregard of\r\n    treaty obligations. During the earlier days of our intimate\r\n    relations with the States British agents found themselves\r\n    compelled, often against their will, to assume responsibility for\r\n    the welfare of the people, to restore order out of chaos, to\r\n    prevent inhuman practices, and to guide the hands of a weak or\r\n    incompetent Ruler as the only alternative to the termination of\r\n    his rule. So too, at the present day, the Government of India\r\n    acknowledges as trustee, a responsibility (which the Princes\r\n    themselves desire to maintain) for the proper administration of\r\n    States during a minority, and also an obligation for the\r\n    prevention or correction of flagrant misgovernment.\"\r\n\r\nAnd also that:\r\n\r\n    \"the position hitherto taken up by Government has been that the\r\n    conditions under which some of the treaties were executed have\r\n    undergone material changes, and the literal fulfilment of\r\n    particular obligations which they impose has become impracticable.\r\n    Practice has been based on the theory that treaties must be read\r\n    as a whole, and that they must be interpreted in the light of the\r\n    relation established between the parties not only at the time when\r\n    a particular treaty was made, but subsequently.\"\r\n\r\nOn these grounds it is proposed to establish a Council of Princes to\r\nwhich questions which affect the States generally or are of concern to\r\nthe Empire as a whole, or to British India and the States in common, may\r\nbe referred for advice and opinion. So long as the Princes do not\r\nintervene either formally or informally in the internal affairs of\r\nBritish India, we have no objection to the scheme. On the other hand, we\r\ndo hope some method will be found by which, with the consent of the\r\nparties interested the smaller principalities scattered all over the\r\ncountry may, for administrative purposes, be merged either in the\r\nBritish area or in the bigger Native States which possess full power of\r\nautonomy over their internal affairs. In the long run it will be\r\ncomparatively easy to convert the latter to an acceptance of the modern\r\nprinciples of government if the number of Native States is reduced and\r\ntheir people achieve that solidarity which comes by community of\r\ninterests and ideas. In this connection it is a happy augury for the\r\nfuture that some of the highest Chiefs like those of Mysore, Baroda,\r\nGwaliar, Indore, Kashmir, Bikaner, Jodhpore, Alwar, and Patiala are\r\nalive to the importance of marching with the times. The people of\r\nBritish India owe them a great debt of gratitude for the moral support\r\nthey have given to their claim for responsible Government by coming out\r\nopenly and freely in favour of the proposed advance. We are sure that\r\nthese Princes will in due time take measures to bring their own\r\nterritories in line with the British provinces and thus strengthen the\r\nties that bind them to their own peoples as well as to the other people\r\nof India. After all, there can be no manner of doubt, as the authors of\r\nthe report predict,\r\n\r\n    \"that the processes at work in British India cannot leave the\r\n    States untouched and must in time affect even those whose ideas\r\n    and institutions are of the most conservative and feudal\r\n    character.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the path of wisdom and sagacity to recognise the world forces that\r\nare at work. No amount of ancient prestige can prevent the people from\r\ncoming into their own. The age of despotism is gone and the autocrats of\r\ntoday must sooner or later hand over their powers to the people. The\r\nmore they conciliate them the longer perhaps they may be able to lead\r\nthem. They may continue as leaders for a long time, but as autocratic\r\ndispensers of favours and fortunes they cannot remain, perhaps not even\r\nfor their life time.\r\n\r\nIn our judgment this part of the Montagu-Chelmsford Report is no less\r\nimportant for the future of Indian democracy than the others that\r\ndirectly deal with British India, and we hope that whatever might be\r\nthe policy as regards the existing States the new law will make it\r\nimpossible for the Government of India and the Secretary of State to\r\ncreate any new States in the future. It is monstrous to transfer\r\nmillions of human beings from one kind of political rule to another like\r\nso many cattle, as was done in 1911. The present rule of any Indian\r\nMaharaja may be as good or as bad as that of a British Governor or\r\nLieutenant Governor, but the latter has in it greater democratic\r\npotentialities than the former, for the mere fact, if for no other,\r\nthat, while the British are more or less amenable to world opinion, the\r\nrulers of Native States are not. It is inhuman, and not in accord with\r\nmodern ideas of right and wrong to reward somebody's loyalty by giving\r\nhim power of life and death over numerous fellow beings, otherwise than\r\nin due course of law. Even the mighty British Government is not the\r\nowner of the bodies and souls of its subjects in India. How, then, can\r\nit assume the right of abandoning them to the absolute rule of a single\r\nindividual, however worthy or loyal he may be? We hope this stupid way\r\nof rewarding loyal services may be ended by an express provision to that\r\neffect in the statute which will be passed relating to the\r\nreorganization of the Government of India.\r\n\r\nIn this connection the following observations made in a leading\r\neditorial of the _Servant of India_, Poona (February 16, 1919), are\r\nworthy of attention:\r\n\r\n\"A hundred years ago, it was decidedly in the interests of British rule,\r\nand probably also in the interests of the people of India generally,\r\nthat the small, ill-governed, and eternally fighting states of India\r\nshould come under the suzerainty of a single powerful power. It may be\r\nregarded as a historical misfortune that this power happened then to be\r\nforeign, though many regard this contact with a virile civilization as\r\nthe making of India. This suzerainty could then be established duly by\r\nentering into treaties with these states and guaranteeing them certain\r\nrights and privileges. But these treaties have now assumed in the eyes\r\nof the descendants of the original princes an air of inspiration; they\r\nhave become a kind of perpetuity. They always come in the way of any\r\nimprovement. When any new policy is proposed to them, they are always\r\nprepared to say, 'This is not in the bond.' One may be allowed to\r\nspeculate as to how many of these Highnesses would have survived to this\r\nday to put forward this claim in the absence of the suzerain power.\r\nThrones in ancient days were as unstable as they are becoming now in\r\nEurope. It is hardly possible that the present popular wave in Europe\r\nwould not have touched our Native States. The subjects of the states\r\nwould have clamoured for a recognition of their rights, and they would\r\nhave had their way. But now the princes feel quite secure. Have they not\r\ngot their treaties? As a result there is no political life at all in the\r\nNative States. The most ardent advocate of Home Rule would be most\r\nviolently against migration to a Native State. The real problem of the\r\nNative States is how to get over the treaties when they conflict with\r\nthe interests of their subjects. The questions discussed at the Chiefs'\r\nConference leave us comparatively cold, as they entirely neglect the\r\npeople most concerned. The questions of the rights of the chiefs and\r\ntheir salutes or precedence are in our opinion of a very secondary\r\nimportance. A renowned statesman in Europe gave at the utmost a life of\r\na dozen years to the most solemn treaty between two countries, for in\r\nthat period circumstances alter and the solid foundation for the treaty\r\ncracks. Is it not high time that the treaties with the chiefs should be\r\nrevised after over a hundred years? It would indeed redound to their\r\ncredit if the chiefs themselves come forward to submit to such\r\nreadjustment. Perhaps their autocratic and irresponsible power may have\r\nto suffer some diminution. But if they consent to that diminution so as\r\nto give it to their subjects in the modern democratic spirit, the real\r\npower and influence of the Native States will increase incalculably. It\r\nis in this direction we wish to see a solution of the problem of the\r\nNative States which are nowadays working as a brake on our national\r\nprogress.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The _Indian Year Book_ for 1918, p. 81.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTHE PROPOSALS\r\n\r\n    There are epochs in the history of the world when in a few raging\r\n    years the character, the destiny, of the whole race is determined\r\n    for unknown ages. This is one.\r\n\r\n                                              DAVID LLOYD GEORGE\r\n\r\n                        \"Sowing the Winter Wheat.\" Speech delivered\r\n                        at Carnarvon, to a meeting of constituents,\r\n                        after becoming Prime Minister, February 3,\r\n                        1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart II of the Report contains the scheme which Mr. Montagu and Lord\r\nChelmsford propose for the solution of the problem which they had set\r\nthemselves to solve in Part I. In giving their reasons for a new policy\r\nthey observe:\r\n\r\n    \"_No further development (on old lines) is possible unless we are\r\n    going to give the people of India some responsibility for their\r\n    own government._ But no one can imagine that no further\r\n    development is necessary. _It is evident that the present\r\n    machinery of government no longer meets the needs of the time; it\r\n    works slowly and it produces irritation_; there is a widespread\r\n    demand on the part of educated Indian opinion for its alteration;\r\n    and the need for advance is recognised by official opinion also.\"\r\n    [Italics are ours.]\r\n\r\nThe new policy sketched by them is, in their judgment, \"the logical\r\noutcome of the past. Indians must be enabled, in so far as they attain\r\nresponsibility, to determine for themselves what they want done\r\n\r\n    \"... such limitations on powers as we are now proposing are due\r\n    only to the obvious fact that time is necessary in order to train\r\n    both representatives and electorates for the work which we desire\r\n    them to undertake; and that we offer Indians opportunities at\r\n    short intervals to prove the progress they are making and to make\r\n    good their claim, not by the method of agitation but by positive\r\n    demonstration, to the further stages in self-government which we\r\n    have just indicated.\"\r\n\r\nThat is the only basis on which they maintain they can hope to see in\r\nIndia \"the growth of a conscious feeling of organic unity with the\r\nEmpire as a whole.\" With these and a few more prefatory remarks about\r\nthe educational problem and the attitude of the ryot and the enunciation\r\nof the general principles on which their proposals are based they\r\nproceed to formulate their scheme, starting first with the provinces.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe proposals relating to Provincial Government may be noticed under the\r\nfollowing heads:\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Financial devolution_: It is proposed that henceforth there\r\nshould be a complete separation of the provincial finances from those of\r\nthe Government of India; that, reserving certain sources of revenue for\r\nthe Government of India, all others should be made over to the\r\nProvincial Governments with the proviso that the first charge on all\r\nProvincial revenues will be a contribution towards the maintenance of\r\nthe Government of India, considered necessary and demanded by the\r\nlatter. A certain amount of power to impose fresh taxes and to raise\r\nloans is also conceded to the provincial Governments subject to the veto\r\nof the Government of India.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Legislative devolution_: \"It is our intention,\" say the authors\r\nof the report, \"to reserve to the Government of India a general\r\noverriding power of legislation for the discharge of all functions which\r\nit will have to perform. It should be enabled under this power to\r\nintervene in any province for the protection and enforcement of the\r\ninterests for which it is responsible; to legislate on any provincial\r\nmatter in respect of which uniformity of legislation is desirable,\r\neither for the whole of India or for any two or more provinces; and to\r\npass legislation which may be adopted either _simpliciter_ or with\r\nmodifications by any province which may wish to make use of it. We think\r\nthat the Government of India must be the sole judge of the propriety of\r\nany legislation which it may undertake under any one of these\r\ncategories, and that its competence so to legislate should not be open\r\nto challenge in the courts. Subject to these reservations we intend that\r\nwithin the field which may be marked off for provincial legislative\r\ncontrol the sole legislative power shall rest with the provincial\r\nlegislatures.\" It is not proposed to put a statutory limitation on the\r\npower of the Government of India to legislate for the provinces, but it\r\nis hoped that \"constitutional practice\" will prevent the central\r\nGovernment interfering in provincial matters unless the interests for\r\nwhich the latter is responsible are directly affected.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Provincial Executive_: Article 220 gives the Governor the power\r\nto appoint \"one or two additional members of his Government as members\r\nwithout portfolio for purposes of consultation and advice.\"\r\n\r\nThese, in substance, are the proposals of the Secretary of State and the\r\nGovernment of India for the future government of the provinces into\r\nwhich India is divided. Some of these latter and some other tracts are\r\nexpressly excluded from the operation of these recommendations. It will\r\nbe at once observed that this is neither autonomy nor home rule. It is a\r\nkind of hybrid system with final powers of veto and control vested in\r\nthe Government of India. The provision as to Provincial Legislatures\r\nmake it still more complicated.\r\n\r\n    \"Let us now explain how we contemplate in future that the\r\n    executive Governments of the provinces shall be constituted. As we\r\n    have seen, three provinces are now governed by a Governor and an\r\n    Executive Council of three members, of whom one is in practice an\r\n    Indian and two are usually appointed from the Indian Civil\r\n    Service, although the law says only that they must be qualified by\r\n    twelve years' service under the Crown in India. One province,\r\n    Bihar and Orissa, is administered by a Lieutenant-Governor with a\r\n    council of three constituted in the same way. The remaining five\r\n    provinces, that is to say, the three Lieutenant-Governorships of\r\n    the United Provinces, the Punjab and Burma and the Chief\r\n    Commissionerships of the Central Provinces and Assam are under the\r\n    administration of a single official Head. We find throughout India\r\n    a very general desire for the extension of Council government....\r\n    Our first proposition, therefore, is that in all these provinces\r\n    singleheaded administration must cease and be replaced by\r\n    collective administration.\r\n\r\n    \"In determining the structure of the Executive we have to bear in\r\n    mind the duties with which it will be charged. We start with the\r\n    two postulates; the complete responsibility for the government\r\n    cannot be given immediately without inviting a breakdown, and that\r\n    some responsibility must be given at once if our scheme is to have\r\n    any value. We have defined responsibility as consisting primarily\r\n    in amenability to constituents, and in the second place in\r\n    amenability to an assembly. We do not believe that there is any\r\n    way of satisfying these governing conditions other than by making\r\n    a division of the functions of the Government, between those which\r\n    may be made over to popular control and those which for the\r\n    present must remain in official hands.... We may call these the\r\n    'reserved' and 'transferred' subjects respectively. It then\r\n    follows that for the management of these two categories there must\r\n    be some form of executive body, with a legislative organ in\r\n    harmony with it....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"We propose therefore that in each province the executive\r\n    Government should consist of two parts. One part would comprise\r\n    the head of the province and an executive council of two members.\r\n    In all provinces the head of the Government would be known as\r\n    Governor.... One of the two Executive Councillors would in\r\n    practice be a European qualified by long official experience, and\r\n    the other would be an Indian. It has been urged that the latter\r\n    should be an elected member of the provincial legislative council.\r\n    It is unreasonable that choice should be so limited. It should be\r\n    open to the Governor to recommend whom he wishes.... The Governor\r\n    in council would have charge of the reserved subjects. The other\r\n    part of the government would consist of one member or more than\r\n    one member, according to the number and importance of the\r\n    transferred subjects, chosen by the Governor from the elected\r\n    members of the Legislative council. They would be known as\r\n    ministers. They would be members of the executive Government but\r\n    not members of the Executive Council; they would be appointed for\r\n    the life-time of the legislative council, and if reelected to that\r\n    body would be re-eligible for appointment as members of the\r\n    Executive. As we have said, they would not hold office at the will\r\n    of the legislature but at that of their constituents.\r\n\r\n    \"The portfolios dealing with the transferred subjects would be\r\n    committed to the ministers, and on these subjects the ministers\r\n    together with the Governor would form the administration. On such\r\n    subjects their decision would be final, subject only to the\r\n    Governor's advice and control. We do not contemplate that from the\r\n    outset the Governor should occupy the position of a purely\r\n    constitutional Governor who is bound to accept the decisions of\r\n    his ministers.\"\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Provincial Legislatures_: \"We propose there shall be in each\r\nprovince an enlarged legislative council, differing in size and\r\ncomposition from province to province, with a substantial elected\r\nmajority, elected by direct election on a broad franchise, with such\r\ncommunal and special representation as may be necessary.\"\r\n\r\nThe questions of franchise and special and communal representation have\r\nbeen entrusted to a special committee the report of which is shortly\r\nexpected. The same committee will also decide how many official members\r\nthere will be on each Legislative Council. It is provided that the\r\nGovernor shall be the President of the Council and will have the power\r\nto nominate a Vice-president from the official members. As to the effect\r\nof resolutions it is said that \"we do not propose that resolutions,\r\nwhether on reserved or transferred subjects should be binding.\"\r\n\r\nThe classification of the reserved and transferred subjects was also\r\nleft to a special committee which has since concluded its labours and\r\nwhose report is awaited with interest.\r\n\r\n_Legislation on reserved subjects_:\r\n\r\n    \"For the purpose of enabling the provincial Government to get\r\n    through its legislation on reserved subjects, we propose that the\r\n    head of the Government should have power to certify that a Bill\r\n    dealing with a reserved subject is a measure 'essential to the\r\n    discharge of his responsibility for the peace or tranquillity of\r\n    the province or of any part thereof, or for the discharge of his\r\n    responsibility for the reserved subjects.'... The Bill will be\r\n    read and its general principles discussed in the full legislative\r\n    council. It will at this stage be open to the council by a\r\n    majority vote to request the Governor to refer to the Government\r\n    of India, whose decision on the point shall be final, on the\r\n    question whether the certified Bill deals with a reserved subject.\r\n    If no such reference is made, or if the Government of India decide\r\n    that the certificate has been properly given, the Bill will then\r\n    be automatically referred to a Grand Committee of the council. Its\r\n    composition should reproduce as nearly as possible the proportion\r\n    of the various elements in the larger body ... the grand committee\r\n    in every council should be constituted so as to comprise from 40\r\n    to 50 per cent. of its strength. It should be chosen for each\r\n    Bill, partly by election by ballot, and partly by nomination. The\r\n    Governor should have power to nominate a bare majority exclusive\r\n    of himself. Of the members so nominated not more than two-thirds\r\n    should be officials, and the elected element should be elected _ad\r\n    hoc_ by the elected members of the council on the system of the\r\n    transferable vote.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"On reference to the grand committee, the Bill will be debated by\r\n    that body in the ordinary course, if necessary referred to a\r\n    select committee, to which body we think that the grand committee\r\n    should have power to appoint any member of the legislative council\r\n    whether a member of the grand committee or not. The select\r\n    committee will, as at present, have power to take evidence. Then,\r\n    after being debated in the grand committee and modified as may be\r\n    determined, the Bill will be reported to the whole council. The\r\n    council will have the right to discuss the Bill again generally,\r\n    but will not be able to reject it, or to amend it except on the\r\n    motion of a member of the executive council. The Governor will\r\n    then appoint a time limit within which the Bill may be debated in\r\n    the council, and on its expiry it will pass automatically. But\r\n    during such discussion the council will have the right to pass a\r\n    resolution recording any objection which refers to the principle\r\n    or details of the measure (but not, of course, to the certificate\r\n    of its character), and any such resolution will accompany the Act\r\n    when, after being signed by the Governor, it is submitted to the\r\n    Governor General and the Secretary of State.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Provincial Budget_: \"... the provincial budget should be framed\r\n    by the executive Government as a whole. The first charge on\r\n    provincial revenues will be the contribution to the Government of\r\n    India; and after that the supply for the reserved subjects will\r\n    have priority. The allocation of supply for the transferred\r\n    subjects will be decided by the ministers. If the revenue is\r\n    insufficient for their needs, the question of new taxation will be\r\n    decided by the Governor and the ministers. We are bound to\r\n    recognise that in time new taxation will be necessary, for no\r\n    conceivable economies can finance the new developments which are\r\n    to be anticipated. The budget will then be laid before the council\r\n    which will discuss it and vote by resolution upon the allotments.\r\n    If the legislative council rejects or modifies the proposed\r\n    allotment for reserved subjects, the Governor should have power to\r\n    insist on the whole or any part of the allotment originally\r\n    provided, if for reasons to be stated he certifies its necessity\r\n    in the terms which we have already suggested. We are emphatically\r\n    of opinion that the Governor in Council must be empowered to\r\n    obtain the supply which he declares to be necessary for the\r\n    discharge of his responsibilities. Except in so far as the\r\n    Governor exercises this power the budget would be altered in\r\n    accordance with the resolutions carried in council.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Modification of the Scheme by the Government of India._ \"After\r\n    five years' time from the first meeting of the reformed councils\r\n    we suggest that the Government of India should hear applications\r\n    from either the provincial Government or the provincial council\r\n    for the modification of the reserved and transferred lists of the\r\n    province; and that, after considering the evidence laid before\r\n    them, they should recommend for the approval of the Secretary of\r\n    State the transfer of such further subjects to the transferred\r\n    list as they think desirable. On the other hand, if it should be\r\n    made plain to them that certain functions have been seriously\r\n    maladministered, it will be open to them, with the sanction of the\r\n    Secretary of State, to retransfer subjects from the transferred to\r\n    the reserved list, or to place restrictions for the future on the\r\n    minister's powers in respect of certain transferred subjects....\r\n    But it is also desirable to complete the responsibility of the\r\n    ministers for the transferred subjects. This should come in one of\r\n    two ways, either at the initiative of the council if it desires\r\n    and is prepared to exercise greater control over the ministers, or\r\n    at the discretion of the Government of India, which may wish to\r\n    make this change as a condition of the grant of new, or of the\r\n    maintainance of existing, powers. We propose, therefore, that the\r\n    Government of India may, when hearing such applications, direct\r\n    that the ministers' salaries, instead of any longer being treated\r\n    as a reserved subject, and, therefore, protected in the last\r\n    resort by the Governor's order from interference should be\r\n    specifically voted each year by the legislative council; or,\r\n    failing such direction by the Government of India, it should be\r\n    open to the councils at that time or subsequently to demand by\r\n    resolution that such ministers' salaries should be so voted, and\r\n    the Government of India should thereupon give effect to such\r\n    request.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Periodic commissions_: ... Ten years after the first meeting of\r\n    the new councils established under the Statute a commission should\r\n    be appointed to review the position. Criticism has been expressed\r\n    in the past of the composition of Royal Commissions, and it is our\r\n    intention that the commission which we suggest should be regarded\r\n    as authoritative and should derive its authority from Parliament\r\n    itself. The names of the commissioners, therefore, should be\r\n    submitted by the Secretary of State to both Houses of Parliament\r\n    for approval by resolution. The commissioners' mandate should be\r\n    to consider whether by the end of the term of the legislature then\r\n    in existence it would be possible to establish complete\r\n    responsible government in any province or provinces, or how far it\r\n    would be possible to approximate it in others; to advise on the\r\n    continued reservation of any departments for the transfer of which\r\n    to popular control it has been proved to their satisfaction that\r\n    the time had not yet come; to recommend the retransfer of other\r\n    matters to the control of the Governor in Council if serious\r\n    maladministration were established; and to make any\r\n    recommendations for the working of responsible government or the\r\n    improvement of the constitutional machinery which experience of\r\n    the systems in operation may show to be desirable....\r\n\r\n    \"There are several other important matters, germane in greater or\r\n    less degree to our main purpose, which the commission should\r\n    review. They should investigate the progress made in admitting\r\n    Indians into the higher ranks of the public service. They should\r\n    examine the apportionment of the financial burden of India with a\r\n    view to adjusting it more fairly between the provinces. The\r\n    commission should also examine the development of education among\r\n    the people and the progress and working of local self-governing\r\n    bodies. Lastly the commission should consider the working of the\r\n    franchise and the constitution of electorates, including the\r\n    important matter of the retention of communal representation.\r\n    Indeed, we regard the development of a broad franchise as the arch\r\n    on which the edifice of self-government must be raised; for we\r\n    have no intention that our reforms should result merely in the\r\n    transfer of powers from a bureaucracy to an oligarchy....\"\r\n\r\n    \"In proposing the appointment of a commission ten years after the\r\n    new Act takes effect we wish to guard against possible\r\n    misunderstanding. We would not be taken as implying that there can\r\n    be established by that time complete responsible government in the\r\n    provinces. In many of the provinces no such consummation can\r\n    follow in the time named. The pace will be everywhere unequal,\r\n    though progress in one province will always stimulate progress\r\n    elsewhere; but undue expectations might be aroused, if we\r\n    indicated any opinion as to the degree of approximation to\r\n    complete self-government that might be reached even in one or two\r\n    of the most advanced provinces. The reasons that make complete\r\n    responsibility at present impossible are likely to continue\r\n    operative in some degree even after a decade.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe proposals regarding the Government of India called the Central\r\nGovernment may be thus summed up:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) _General_: \"We have already made our opinion clear that\r\n    pending the development of responsible government in the provinces\r\n    the Government of India must remain responsible only to\r\n    Parliament. In other words, in all matters which it judges to be\r\n    essential to the discharge of its responsibilities for peace,\r\n    order, and good government it must, saving only for its\r\n    accountability to Parliament, retain indisputable power.\"\r\n\r\n    (_b_) _The Governor General's Executive Council_: \"We would\r\n    therefore abolish such statutory restrictions as now exist in\r\n    respect of the appointment of Members of the Governor General's\r\n    Council, so as to give greater elasticity both in respect to the\r\n    size of the Government and the distribution of work.\"\r\n\r\nAt present there is one Indian member in the Viceroy's Executive Council\r\nconsisting of six ordinary members and one extraordinary besides the\r\nViceroy. This scheme recommends the appointment of another Indian.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) _The Indian Legislative Council_.\r\n\r\n    I. Legislative Assembly: \"We recommend therefore that the strength\r\n    of the legislative council, to be known in future as the\r\n    Legislative Assembly of India, should be raised to a total\r\n    strength of about 100 members, so as to be far more truly\r\n    representative of British India. We propose that two-thirds of\r\n    this total should be returned by election; and that one-third\r\n    should be nominated by the Governor General, of which third not\r\n    less than a third again should be non-officials selected with the\r\n    object of representing minority or special interests.... Some\r\n    special representation, we think, there must be, as for European\r\n    and Indian commerce, and also for the large landlords. There\r\n    should be also communal representation for Muhammadans in most\r\n    provinces and also for Sikhs in the Punjab.\"\r\n\r\n    II. The Council of State: \"We do not propose to institute a\r\n    complete bi-cameral system, but to create a second chamber, known\r\n    as the Council of State, which shall take its part in ordinary\r\n    legislative business and shall be the final legislative authority\r\n    in matters which the government regards as essential. The Council\r\n    of State will be composed of 50 members, exclusive of the Governor\r\n    General, who would be President, with power to appoint a\r\n    Vice-President who would normally take his place: not more than 25\r\n    will be officials, including the members of the executive council,\r\n    and 4 would be non-officials nominated by the Governor General.\r\n    Official members would be eligible for nomination to both the\r\n    Legislative Assembly and the Council of State. There would be 21\r\n    elected members of whom 15 will be returned by the non-official\r\n    members of the provincial legislative councils, each council\r\n    returning two members, other than those of Burma, the Central\r\n    Provinces and Assam which will return one member each....\r\n\r\n    \"Inasmuch as the Council of State will be the supreme legislative\r\n    authority for India on all crucial questions and also the revising\r\n    authority upon all Indian legislation, we desire to attract to it\r\n    the services of the best men available in the country. We desire\r\n    that the Council of State should develop something of the\r\n    experience and dignity of a body of Elder Statesmen; and we\r\n    suggest therefore that the Governor General in Council should make\r\n    regulations as to the qualification of candidates for election to\r\n    that body which will ensure that their status and position and\r\n    record of services will give to the Council a senatorial\r\n    character, and the qualities usually regarded as appropriate to a\r\n    revising chamber.\"\r\n\r\n    III. Legislative procedure: \"Let us now explain how this\r\n    legislative machinery will work. It will make for clearness to\r\n    deal separately with Government Bills and Bills introduced by\r\n    non-official members. A Government Bill will ordinarily be\r\n    introduced and carried through all the usual stages in the\r\n    Legislative Assembly. It will then go in the ordinary course to\r\n    the Council of State, and if there amended in any way which the\r\n    Assembly is not willing to accept, it will be submitted to a joint\r\n    session of both Houses, by whose decision its ultimate fate will\r\n    be decided. This will be the ordinary course of legislation. But\r\n    it might well happen that amendments made by the Council of State\r\n    were such as to be essential in the view of the Government if the\r\n    purpose with which the Bill was originally introduced was to be\r\n    achieved, and in this case the Governor General in Council would\r\n    certify that the amendments were essential to the interests of\r\n    peace, order, or good government. The assembly would then not have\r\n    power to reject or modify these amendments, nor would they be open\r\n    to revision in a joint session.\r\n\r\n    \"We have to provide for two other possibilities. Cases may occur\r\n    in which the Legislative Assembly refuses leave to the\r\n    introduction of a Bill or throws out a Bill which the Government\r\n    regarded as necessary. For such a contingency we would provide\r\n    that if leave to introduce a Government Bill is refused, or if the\r\n    Bill is thrown out at any stage, the Government should have the\r\n    power, on the certificate of the Governor General in Council that\r\n    the Bill is essential to the interests of peace, order, or good\r\n    government, to refer it _de novo_ to the Council of State; and if\r\n    the Bill, after being taken in all its stages through the Council\r\n    of State, was passed by that body, it would become law without\r\n    further reference to the Assembly. Further, there may be cases\r\n    when the consideration of a measure by both chambers would take\r\n    too long if the emergency which called for the measure is to be\r\n    met. Such a contingency should rarely arise; but we advise that in\r\n    cases of emergency, so certified by the Governor General in\r\n    Council, it should be open to the Government to introduce a Bill\r\n    in the Council of State, and upon its being passed there merely to\r\n    report it to the Assembly.\"\r\n\r\n    IV. Powers of dissolution, etc.: \"The Governor General should in\r\n    our opinion have power at any time to dissolve either the\r\n    Legislative Assembly or the Council of State or both these bodies.\r\n    It is perhaps unnecessary to add that the Governor General and\r\n    the Secretary of State should retain their existing powers of\r\n    assent, reservation, and disallowance to all Acts of the Indian\r\n    legislature. The present powers of the Governor General in Council\r\n    under section 71 of the Government of India Act. 1915, to make\r\n    regulations proposed by local Governments for the peace and good\r\n    government of backward tracts of territory should also be\r\n    preserved; with the modification that it will in future rest with\r\n    the Head of the province concerned to propose such regulations to\r\n    the Government of India.\"\r\n\r\n    V. Fiscal legislation: \"Fiscal legislation will, of course, be\r\n    subject to the procedure which we have recommended in respect of\r\n    Government Bills. The budget will be introduced in the Legislative\r\n    Assembly but the Assembly will not vote it. Resolutions upon\r\n    budget matters and upon all other questions, whether moved in the\r\n    Assembly or in the Council of State, will continue to be advisory\r\n    in character.\"\r\n\r\n    (d) Privy Council: \"We have a further recommendation to make. We\r\n    would ask that His Majesty may be graciously pleased to approve\r\n    the institution of a Privy Council for India.... The Privy\r\n    Council's office would be to advise the Governor General when he\r\n    saw fit to consult it on questions of policy and administration.\"\r\n\r\n    (e) Periodic commissions: \"At the end of the last chapter we\r\n    recommended that ten years after the institution of our reforms,\r\n    and again at intervals of twelve years thereafter, a commission\r\n    approved by Parliament should investigate the working of the\r\n    changes introduced into the provinces, and recommend as to their\r\n    further progress. It should be equally the duty of the commission\r\n    to examine and report upon the new constitution of the Government\r\n    of India, with particular reference to the working of the\r\n    machinery for representation, the procedure by certificate, and\r\n    the results of joint sessions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nINDIA OFFICE IN LONDON\r\n\r\nThe principal proposals under this head may be thus summarized;\r\n\r\n    \"We advise that the Secretary of State's salary, like that of all\r\n    other Ministers of the Crown, should be defrayed from home\r\n    revenues and voted annually by Parliament. This will enable any\r\n    live questions of Indian administration to be discussed by the\r\n    House of Commons in Committee of Supply.... It might be thought to\r\n    follow that the whole charges of the India Office establishment\r\n    should similarly be transferred to the home Exchequer; but this\r\n    matter is complicated by a series of past transactions, and by the\r\n    amount of agency work which the India Office does on behalf of the\r\n    Government of India; and we advise that our proposed committee\r\n    upon the India Office organization should examine it and taking\r\n    these factors into consideration, determine which of the various\r\n    India Office charges should be so transferred, and which can\r\n    legitimately be retained as a burden on Indian revenues.\r\n\r\n    \"But the transfer of charges which we propose, although it will\r\n    give reality to the debates on Indian affairs, will not ensure in\r\n    Parliament a better informed or a more sustained interest in\r\n    India. We feel that this result can only be accomplished by\r\n    appointing a Select Committee of Parliament on Indian affairs.\"\r\n\r\nThe above in substance is the proposed scheme. In India it has met with\r\nvaried response. The European community does not approve of it. They\r\nthink it is too radical. The European Services have struck a note of\r\nrebellion threatening to resign in case of its acceptance by Parliament.\r\nThe Indian politicians are divided into two camps. Their views are best\r\nrepresented by the following tabular statement which we reproduce from\r\nthe Indian newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\nA COMPARISON BETWEEN THE RESOLUTIONS RELATING TO THE REFORM PROPOSALS\r\nPASSED\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ordinary Rights of Citizens_\r\n\r\n    BY THE SPECIAL CONGRESS             BY THE MODERATE CONFERENCE\r\n\r\n  Resolution IV.

It will be easily seen that Indian\r\nopinion, of both Hindus and Mussulmans, is substantially in accord in\r\ntheir demands for the democratization of the Central government and in\r\ntheir criticism of the rest of the scheme. The Indians have thus\r\nexercised their right of self-determination through their popular bodies\r\nand are entitled to get what they demand. After all, what they ask for\r\nis only a modest instalment of autonomy under British control.\r\n\r\nIn the appendices the reader will find a comparative table showing (a)\r\nthe present Constitution of Government in India (b) the proposals of the\r\nSecretary of State and the Viceroy (c) and the Congress League Scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nINDIA'S CLAIM TO FISCAL AUTONOMY \"INDUSTRIES AND TARIFFS\"\r\n\r\n    ... for equality of right amongst nations, small as well as\r\n    great, is one of the fundamental issues this country and her\r\n    allies are fighting to establish in this war.\r\n\r\n                                              DAVID LLOYD GEORGE\r\n\r\n                        \"The War Aims of the Allies.\" Speech delivered\r\n                        to delegates of the Trade Unions, at the Central\r\n                        Hall, Westminster, January 5, 1918.\r\n\r\n    I beg to record my strong opinion that in the matter of Indian\r\n    industries we are bound to consider Indian interests firstly,\r\n    secondly, and thirdly. I mean by \"firstly\" that the local raw\r\n    products should be utilised, by secondly, that industries should be\r\n    introduced and by \"thirdly\" that the profits of such industry\r\n    should remain in the country.\r\n\r\n                                         SIR FREDERICK NICHOLSON\r\n\r\n                        Quoted on page 300, Report of the Indian\r\n                        Industrial Commission, 1916-1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic bondage is the worst of all bondages. Economic dependence, or\r\nthe lack of economic independence, is the source of all misery,\r\nindividual or national. A person economically dependent upon another is\r\na virtual slave, despite appearances. He who supplies food and raiment\r\nand the necessities of life is the real master.\r\n\r\nThe desire for gain dominates the world and all its activities. Even\r\nreligion, as ordinarily understood, interpreted and administered, is a\r\ngame of pounds and shillings, say what one may to the contrary. There\r\nare exceptions to this statement, but they are few and far between. The\r\nworld does not subsist by bread alone, but without bread it cannot exist\r\neven for a minute. The generality of the world cares more for bread than\r\nfor anything else, though there are individuals and groups of\r\nindividuals who would not stoop to obtain bread by dishonorable means\r\nand those also who would die rather than obtain bread by the violation\r\nof their soul.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous ways in which a subject nation feels the humiliation\r\nand helplessness of her position, but none is so telling and so\r\neffective as the subordination of her economic interests to those of the\r\ndominant power. This is especially true in these days of free and easy\r\ntransportation, of quick journeys, and of scientific warfare. In any\r\nstruggle between nations, the victory eventually must rest with the one\r\nin possession of the largest number of \"silver bullets.\" It is true that\r\nsilver bullets alone will not do unless there are brains and bodies to\r\nuse them, but the latter without the former are helpless.\r\n\r\nA nation may be the greatest producer of food; yet she may die of hunger\r\nfrom lack of ability to keep her own produce for herself. Food obeys the\r\nbehest of the silver bullets. The law of self-preservation, therefore,\r\nrequires only that nations be free to regulate their own household,\r\nsubject to the condition that thereby they do not violate the rules of\r\nhumanity or trample upon the rights of any human being.\r\n\r\nMr. Montagu and Lord Chelmsford have, in parts of their Report, been\r\nextremely candid. The value of their joint production lies in this\r\ncandidness. In no other part, perhaps, have they been so candid as in\r\nthe one dealing with \"Industries and Tariff.\" In Paragraph 331 they\r\nfrankly admit the truth of the following observation of the late Mr.\r\nRanade on the economic effects of British rule in India:\r\n\r\n    \"The political domination of one country by another attracts far\r\n    more attention than the more formidable, though more unfelt,\r\n    domination which the capital, enterprise and skill of one country\r\n    exercise over the trade and manufactures of another. This latter\r\n    domination has an insidious influence which paralyses the springs\r\n    of all the various activities which together make up the life of a\r\n    nation.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of a letter addressed to the _Westminster Gazette_ in\r\n1917, Lord Curzon said that \"the fiscal policy of India during the last\r\nthirty or forty years has been shaped far more in Manchester than in\r\nCalcutta.\" This candid admission about \"the subordination of Indian\r\nfiscal policy to the Secretary of State and a House of Commons\r\npowerfully affected by Lancashire influence,\" is the keynote of the\r\nIndian demand for Home Rule. The authors of the Montagu-Chelmsford\r\nReport say so quite frankly and fairly in Paragraphs 332 to 336 of their\r\nreport, from which we make the following extracts:\r\n\r\n    \"The people are poor; and their poverty raises the question\r\n    whether the general level of well-being could not be materially\r\n    raised by the development of industries. It is also clear that the\r\n    lack of outlet for educated youth is a serious misfortune which\r\n    has contributed not a little in the past to political unrest in\r\n    Bengal. But perhaps an even greater mischief is the discontent\r\n    aroused in the minds of those who are jealous for India by seeing\r\n    that she is so largely dependent on foreign countries for\r\n    manufactured goods. They noted that her foreign trade was always\r\n    growing, but they also saw that its leading feature continued to\r\n    be the barter of raw materials valued at relatively low prices for\r\n    imported manufactures, which obviously afforded profits and\r\n    prosperity to other countries industrially more advanced.\r\n    Patriotic Indians might well ask themselves why these profits\r\n    should not accrue to their country: and also why so large a\r\n    portion of the industries which flourished in the country was\r\n    financed by European capital and managed by European skill.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The fact that India's foreign trade was largely with the United\r\n    Kingdom gave rise to a suspicion that her industrial backwardness\r\n    was positively encouraged in the interests of British\r\n    manufactures, and the maintenance of the excise duty on locally\r\n    manufactured cotton goods in the alleged interests of Lancashire\r\n    is very widely accepted as a conclusive proof of such a purpose.\r\n    On a smaller scale, the maintenance of a Stores Department at the\r\n    India Office is looked upon as an encouragement to the Government\r\n    to patronize British at the expense of local manufacturers.\"\r\n\r\nThere can thus be no autonomy without fiscal autonomy. In fact, the\r\nlatter alone is the determining characteristic of an autonomous\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe one national trait which distinguishes the British from other\r\nnations of the world is their habit of truthfulness and frankness. When\r\nwe say that we do not thereby mean that all Britishers are equally\r\ntruthful--to the same extent and degree. But we do mean that on the\r\nwhole the British nation has a larger percentage of truthful and candid\r\npersons in her family than any other nation on the face of the earth.\r\nWhere their interests clash with those of others, they can be as hard,\r\nexacting and cruel as any one else in the world. But repentance\r\novertakes them sooner than it does the others. They have a queer but\r\nadmirable faculty of introspection which few other people possess to the\r\nsame extent and in the same numbers. This is what endears them even to\r\nthose who are never tired of cursing their snobbishness and masterful\r\nimperialism. The faculty of occasionally seeing themselves with the eyes\r\nof others, makes them the most successful _rulers of men_. They are as a\r\nnation lacking in imagination, but there are individuals amongst them\r\nwho can see, if they will, their own faults; who can and do speak out\r\ntheir minds honestly and truthfully, even though by so doing they may\r\ntemporarily earn odium and unpopularity.\r\n\r\nThe remarks and observations of the eminent authors of the Report\r\nrelating to the fiscal relations of India and England reflect the\r\nhonesty of their purpose and the sincerity of their mind as no other\r\npart of the Report does. They have entered upon the subject with great\r\ndiffidence and, though expressing themselves with marked candor and\r\nfairness, have refrained from making any definite recommendations.\r\n\r\nIn this respect it will be only fair to acknowledge the equally candid\r\nopinion of Mr. Austin Chamberlain, who, in 1917, made a most significant\r\nconfession by stating on an important occasion that \"India will not\r\nremain, and ought not to remain content to be a hewer of wood and a\r\ndrawer of water for the rest of the Empire.\"\r\n\r\nTo our simple minds, not accustomed to the anomalies of official life,\r\nit seems inexplicable how, after these candid admissions, the authors\r\ncould have any hesitation in recommending the only remedy by which\r\nIndia's wrong could be righted and her economic rights secured in the\r\nfuture--viz., fiscal autonomy.\r\n\r\nIn Paragraph 335 the authors of the report give the genesis of the\r\nSwadeshi boycott movement of 1905, and very pertinently observe that \"in\r\nJapanese progress and efficiency\" the educated Indians see \"an example\r\nof what could be effected by an Asiatic nation free of foreign control,\"\r\nor in other words, of what could be achieved by India, if she had a\r\nnational government of her own interested in her industrial advance. Mr.\r\nMontagu and Lord Chelmsford thus rightly observe that \"English theories\r\nto the appropriate limits of the State's activity are inapplicable in\r\nIndia\" and that if the resources of the country are to be developed the\r\nGovernment must take action.\r\n\r\n\"After the war,\" add the authors, \"the need for industrial development\r\nwill be all the greater unless India is to become a mere dumping-ground\r\nfor the manufactures of foreign nations which will then be competing all\r\nthe more keenly for the markets on which their political strength so\r\nperceptibly depends. India will certainly consider herself entitled to\r\nclaim all the help that her Government can give her to enable her to\r\ntake her place as a manufacturing country; and unless the claim is\r\nadmitted it will surely turn into an insistent request for a tariff\r\nwhich will penalize imported articles without respect of origin.\"\r\n\r\nFurther on the Report states:\r\n\r\n    \"We are agreed therefore that there must be a definite change of\r\n    view; and that the Government must admit and shoulder its\r\n    responsibility for furthering the industrial development of the\r\n    country. The difficulties by this time are well-known. In the\r\n    past, and partly as a result of recent _swadeshi_ experiences,\r\n    India's capital has not generally been readily available; among\r\n    some communities at least there is apparent distaste for practical\r\n    training, and a comparative weakness of mutual trust; _skilled\r\n    labour is lacking_, and although _labour is plentiful, education\r\n    is needed to inculcate a higher standard of living and so to\r\n    secure a continuous supply; there is a dearth of technical\r\n    institutions; there is also a want of practical information about\r\n    the commercial potentialities of India's war products_. Though\r\n    these are serious difficulties, they are not insuperable; but they\r\n    will be overcome only if the State comes forward boldly as guide\r\n    and helper. On the other hand, there are good grounds for hope.\r\n    India has great natural resources, mineral and vegetable. She has\r\n    furnished supplies of manganese, tungsten, mica, jute, copra, lac,\r\n    etc., for use in the war. She has abundant coal, even if its\r\n    geographical distribution is uneven; she has also in her large\r\n    rivers ample means of creating water-power. There is good reason\r\n    for believing that she will greatly increase her output of oil.\r\n    Her forest wealth is immense, and much of it only awaits the\r\n    introduction of modern means of transportation, a bolder\r\n    investment of capital, and the employment of extra staff; while\r\n    the patient and laborious work of conservation that has been\r\n    steadily proceeding joined with modern scientific methods of\r\n    improving supplies and increasing output, will yield a rich\r\n    harvest in the future. We have been assured that Indian capital\r\n    will be forthcoming once it is realized that it can be invested\r\n    with security and profit in India; a purpose that will be\r\n    furthered by the provision of increased facilities for banking and\r\n    credit. Labor, though abundant, is handicapped by still pursuing\r\n    uneconomical methods, and its output would be greatly increased by\r\n    the extended use of machinery. We have no doubt that there is an\r\n    immense scope for the application of scientific methods.\r\n    Conditions are ripe for the development of new and for the revival\r\n    of old industries, and the real enthusiasm for industries which is\r\n    not confined to the ambitions of a few individuals but rests on\r\n    the general desire to see Indian capital and labour applied\r\n    jointly to the good of the country, seem to us the happiest\r\n    augury.\"\r\n\r\nThe views of educated India about fiscal policy have been very\r\nfaithfully reproduced in Paragraphs 341 and 342, which also we reproduce\r\nalmost bodily:\r\n\r\n    \"Connected intimately with the matter of industries is the\r\n    question of the Indian tariff. This subject was excluded from the\r\n    deliberations of the Industrial Commission now sitting because it\r\n    was not desirable at that juncture to raise any question of the\r\n    modification of India's fiscal policy; but its exclusion was none\r\n    the less the object of some legitimate criticism in India. The\r\n    changes which we propose in the Government of India will still\r\n    leave the settlement of India's tariff in the hands of a\r\n    government amenable to Parliament and the Secretary of State; but\r\n    inasmuch as the tariff reacts on many matters which will\r\n    henceforth come more and more under Indian control, we think it\r\n    well that we should put forward for the information of His\r\n    Majesty's Government the views of educated Indians upon this\r\n    subject. We have no immediate proposals to make; we are anxious\r\n    merely that any decisions which may hereafter be taken should be\r\n    taken with full appreciation of educated Indian opinion.\r\n\r\n    \"The theoretical free trader, we believe, hardly exists in India\r\n    at present. As was shown by the debates in the Indian Legislative\r\n    Council in March, 1913, educated Indian opinion ardently desires a\r\n    tariff. It rightly wishes to find another substantial basis than\r\n    that of the land for Indian revenues, and it turns to a tariff to\r\n    provide one. Desiring industries which will give him Indian-made\r\n    clothes to wear and Indian-made articles to use, the educated\r\n    Indian looks to the example of other countries which have relied\r\n    on tariffs, and seizes on the admission of even free traders that\r\n    for the nourishment of nascent industries a tariff is permissible.\r\n    We do not know whether he pauses to reflect that these industries\r\n    will be largely financed by foreign capital attracted by the\r\n    tariff, although we have evidence that he has not learned to\r\n    appreciate the advantages of foreign capital. But whatever\r\n    economic fallacy underlies his reasoning, these are his firm\r\n    beliefs; and though he may be willing to concede the possibility\r\n    that he is wrong, he will not readily concede that it is our\r\n    business to decide the matter for him. He believes that as long as\r\n    we continue to decide for him we shall decide in the interests of\r\n    England and not according to his wishes; and he points to the\r\n    debate in the House of Commons on the differentiation of the\r\n    cotton excise in support of his contention. So long as the people\r\n    who refuse India protection are interested in manufactures with\r\n    which India might compete, Indian opinion cannot bring itself to\r\n    believe that the refusal is disinterested or dictated by care for\r\n    the best interests of India. This real and keen desire for fiscal\r\n    autonomy does not mean that educated opinion in India is unmindful\r\n    of Imperial obligations....\"\r\n\r\nThese admissions should put India's claims for fiscal autonomy beyond\r\nthe range of doubt and dispute, but so strange are the ways of modern\r\nstatesmanship that consistency and logic are not the necessary\r\naccompaniments thereof.\r\n\r\nThe authors have advanced another very strong argument for the economic\r\ndevelopment of India, viz., \"military value,\" which makes the case\r\nconclusive. This argument has been supplied by the Great War and is so\r\nwell known that we need not state it in their words.\r\n\r\nIf India is to prosper and take her legitimate place in the British\r\nCommonwealth, and in the great family of Nations of the World, it is\r\nabsolutely necessary that she should be given complete fiscal freedom to\r\nmanage her own affairs, develop her own industries and do her own\r\ntrading. Considering her size and resources, it wounds her self-respect\r\nand makes her feel exceedingly mean and small to go begging for alms and\r\ncharity every time there is a failure of rains and the cry of famine is\r\nraised.\r\n\r\nFor a nation of 315 millions of human beings living in a country which\r\nnature has endowed with all its choicest blessings, rich and fertile\r\nsoil, plenty of water and sun, an abundant supply of metals and coal,\r\nwilling labor, artistic skill and a power of manipulating for beauty and\r\nelegance unexcelled in the world--to exist in pitiful economic\r\ndependence is a condition most deplorable and most pathetic. We want no\r\ncharity, no concessions, no favors, no preference. What we most\r\nearnestly beg and ask for is an _opportunity_.\r\n\r\n    For a synopsis of the findings and recommendations of the\r\n    Industrial Commission mentioned in this chapter see appendix 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn December, 1917, the Government of India appointed a committee of\r\nthree Englishmen and two Indians (1) \"to investigate and report on the\r\nnature and extent of the criminal conspiracies connected with the\r\nrevolutionary movements in India, (2) to examine and consider the\r\ndifficulties that have arisen in dealing with such conspiracies and to\r\nadvise as to the legislation, if any, necessary to enable the government\r\nto deal effectively with them.\" Of the three English members, Mr.\r\nJustice Rowlatt of the King's Bench Division, England, was appointed as\r\npresident, and of the other two, one was a judge in the service of the\r\nGovernment and the other a member of a Board of Revenue in one of the\r\nIndian Provinces. Of the two Indians, one was a judge and the other a\r\npracticing lawyer.\r\n\r\nThis committee submitted its report in April, 1918, which was published\r\nby the Government of India in July of the same year. The president, Mr.\r\nJustice Rowlatt's letter covering the report gives the nature of the\r\nevidence upon which their report is based, which is as follows:\r\n\"Statements have been placed before us with documentary evidence by the\r\nGovernments of Bengal, Bombay, Bihar and Orissa, the Central Provinces,\r\nthe United Provinces, the Punjab and Burmah as well as by the\r\nGovernment of India. In every case, except that of Madras, we were\r\nfurther attended by officers of the government, presenting this\r\nstatement, who gave evidence before us. In the two provinces in which we\r\nheld sittings, namely, Bengal and Punjab, we further invited and secured\r\nthe attendance of individuals, or as deputed by associations, of\r\ngentlemen who we thought might give us information from various\r\nnon-official points of view.\"\r\n\r\nIt is clear from this statement that the investigation of the committee\r\nwas neither judicial nor even semi-judicial; it was a purely\r\nadministrative inquiry conducted behind the backs of the individuals\r\nconcerned, without the latter having any opportunity of cross-examining\r\nthe witnesses or giving their explanations of the evidence against them.\r\nWhile the different Governments in India were fully represented in each\r\ncase by the ablest of their servants, the individuals investigated were\r\nnot. We do not want to insinuate that either the Governments or the\r\nofficers deputed by them were unfair in their evidence. All that we want\r\nto point out is that the other side had no opportunity of putting their\r\ncase before the committee. Consequently, it is no wonder that one comes\r\nacross many traces of political and racial bias both in the introduction\r\nand the Report.\r\n\r\nThe very first paragraph of the introduction betrays either ignorance on\r\nthe part of the committee about the ancient history of India, or a\r\ndeliberate misrepresentation of the nature of the Hindu State. The\r\ncommittee says: \"Republican or Parliamentary forms of governments as at\r\npresent understood were neither desired nor known in India until after\r\nthe establishment of British rule. In the Hindu State the form of\r\ngovernment was an absolute monarchy, though the monarch was by the Hindu\r\nShastras hedged round by elaborate rules for securing the welfare of his\r\nsubjects and was assisted by a body of councillors, the chief of whom\r\nwere Brahmin members of the priestly class which derived authority from\r\na time when the priests were the sole repositories of knowledge and\r\ntherefore the natural instruments of administration.\" The statements\r\nmade in this paragraph do not represent the whole truth.\r\n\r\nThe committee ignores the fact that Republican or Parliamentary forms of\r\nGovernment \"_as at present understood_\" were neither desired nor known\r\nin any part of the world, except perhaps England itself until _after_\r\nthe establishment of British rule in India.[1] Then the committee has\r\naltogether ignored that, in the Hindu State, the form of government was\r\nnot an absolute monarchy _always and in all parts of India_. There is\r\nample historical evidence to prove that India had many Republican\r\nStates, along with oligarchies and monarchies at one and the same period\r\nof her history. The second part of the second sentence is also not\r\ncorrect, because the priestly class derived its authority from a time\r\nwhen the priests were not the sole repositories of knowledge. The\r\nseveral Hindu political treatises belong to a period when the whole\r\npopulace was highly educated and could take substantial part in the\r\ndetermination of the affairs of their country.\r\n\r\nEqually misleading is the last sentence of the introduction where the\r\ncommittee says that it is among the Chitpavan Brahmins of the Poona\r\ndistrict that they first find indications of a revolutionary movement.\r\nThis statement is incorrect, if it means that after the establishment of\r\nBritish rule in India no attempt had been made to overthrow it prior to\r\nthe Revolutionary movement inaugurated by the Poona Brahmins. The\r\nstatement ignores three such attempts which are known to history; viz.,\r\n(_a_) the great Mutiny of 1857, (_b_) the Wahábee Rebellion of Bengal,\r\nand (_c_) the Kúká Rebellion of the Punjab; not to mention other minor\r\nattempts made in other places by other people.\r\n\r\nYet we think that this report is a very valuable document, giving in one\r\nplace the history and the progress of the Revolutionary Movement in\r\nIndia. The findings and the recommendations of the committee may not be\r\nall correct, but the material collected and published for the first time\r\nis too valuable to be neglected by anyone who wants to have an\r\nintelligent grasp of the political situation in India, such as has\r\ndeveloped within the last twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe committee gives a summary of its conclusions as to the conspiracies\r\nin Chapter XV, which we copy verbatim:\r\n\r\n    \"In Bombay they have been purely Brahmin and mostly Chitpavan. In\r\n    Bengal the conspirators have been young men belonging to the\r\n    educated middle classes. Their propaganda has been elaborate,\r\n    persistent and ingenious. In their own province it has produced a\r\n    long series of murders and robberies. In Bihar and Orissa, the\r\n    United Provinces, the Central Provinces and Madras, it took no\r\n    root, but occasionally led to crime and disorder. In the Punjab\r\n    the return of emigrants from America, bent on revolution and\r\n    bloodshed, produced numerous outrages and the _Ghadr_ conspiracy\r\n    of 1915. In Burma, too, the _Ghadr_ movement was active, but was\r\n    arrested.\r\n\r\n    \"Finally came a Mohammedan conspiracy confined to a small clique\r\n    of fanatics and designed to overthrow British rule with foreign\r\n    aid.\r\n\r\n    \"All these plots have been directed towards one and the same\r\n    objective, the overthrow by force of British rule in India.\r\n    Sometimes they have been isolated; sometimes they have been\r\n    interconnected; sometimes they have been encouraged and supported\r\n    by German influence. All have been successfully encountered with\r\n    the support of Indian loyalty.\"\r\n\r\nIn this general summary the committee has made no attempt to trace out\r\nthe causes that led to the inauguration of the revolutionary movement\r\nand its subsequent progress. A chapter on that subject would have been\r\nmost illuminating.\r\n\r\nIn chapters dealing with provinces they have selected some individuals\r\nand classes on whom to lay blame for \"incitements\" to murders and\r\ncrimes, but have entirely failed to analyze the social, political and\r\neconomic conditions which made such incitements and their success\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIt is clear even from this summary that the only two provinces where the\r\nrevolutionary propaganda took root and resulted in more than occasional\r\noutrages were Bengal and the Punjab.\r\n\r\nIn the Bombay Presidency, revolutionary outrages did not exceed three\r\nwithin a period of 20 years (from 1897 to 1917), two murders and one\r\nbomb-throwing. Besides, three trials for conspiracies are mentioned all\r\nwithin a year (1909-1910), two in Native States and one in British\r\nterritory. Altogether 82 men were prosecuted for being involved in these\r\nconspiracies. The total result comes to this, that in the course of 20\r\nyears about 100 persons were found to be involved in a revolutionary\r\nmovement in a territory embracing an area of 186,923 square miles and a\r\npopulation of 27 million human beings. This is surely by no means a\r\nformidable record justifying extraordinary legislation such as is\r\nproposed.[2] The net loss of human life did not exceed three, though\r\nunfortunately all three victims were Europeans.\r\n\r\nBihar and Orissa formed part of the province of Bengal during most of\r\nthe period covered by the revolutionary movement of Bengal, viz., from\r\n1906 to 1917. It was in Bihar which was then a part of Bengal, that in\r\n1908, the first bomb was thrown. The only other revolutionary outrage\r\nthat took place in Bihar was one in 1913, resulting in the murder of two\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nIn the United Provinces of Agra and Oude, the only tangible evidence of\r\nrevolutionary activity recorded by the committee is the Benares\r\nConspiracy that came to light in 1915-1916. The only outrage noted is\r\nthat of the alleged murder of a fellow revolutionary by a member of the\r\nsame gang.\r\n\r\nTo the Central provinces the committee has given a practically clean\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nIn Madras the revolutionary outrages consisted of one murder (of a\r\nEuropean Magistrate) and one conspiracy involving nine persons.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracies and intrigues detected in Burma are ascribed to people\r\nof other provinces and not a single outrage from that province itself is\r\nreported.\r\n\r\nSo we find that in the period from 1906 to 1907, both inclusive,\r\noutside the provinces of Bengal and the Punjab, the revolutionary crime\r\nwas limited to three outrages and three conspiracies in the Bombay\r\nPresidency, one outrage in Bihar, one outrage and one conspiracy in the\r\nUnited Provinces, one outrage and one conspiracy in Madras and some\r\nintrigues and conspiracies during the war in Burma. Thus the only two\r\nprovinces in which the revolutionary movement established itself to any\r\nappreciable extent was Bengal and the Punjab.\r\n\r\nIn the Punjab, again, the first revolutionary crime took place in\r\nDecember, 1912, and the second in 1913 and the rest all during the War.\r\nCases of seditious utterances and writings are not included in the term\r\n\"revolutionary crime\" used in the above paragraphs. It was from Bengal,\r\nthen, that before the War revolutionary propaganda was carried on to any\r\nlarge extent, revolutionary movements organized and revolutionary crimes\r\ncommitted. About half of the Report deals with Bengal and the general\r\nfindings of the committee may be thus summarized:\r\n\r\n(1) That the object of the movement was the overturning of \"the British\r\ngovernment in India by violent means\" (p. 15 and also p. 19).\r\n\r\n(2) That the class among whom the movement spread was comprised of the\r\n_Bhadralok_ (the respectable middle class). The committee says:\r\n\r\n    \"The people among whom he (i.e., Barendra, the first Bengali\r\n    revolutionary propagandist) worked, the _bhadralok_ of Bengal,\r\n    have been for centuries peaceful and unwarlike, but, through the\r\n    influence of the great central city of Calcutta, were early in\r\n    appreciating the advantages of Western learning. They are mainly\r\n    Hindus and their leading castes are Brahmins, Kayasthas and\r\n    Vaidyas; but with the spread of English education some other\r\n    castes too have adopted _bhadralok_ ideals and modes of life.\r\n    _Bhadralok_ abound in villages as well as in towns, and are thus\r\n    more interwoven with the landed classes than are the literate\r\n    Indians of other provinces. Wherever they live or settle, they\r\n    earnestly desire and often provide English education for their\r\n    sons. The consequence is that a number of Anglo-vernacular\r\n    schools, largely maintained by private enterprise, have sprung up\r\n    throughout the towns and villages of Bengal. No other province of\r\n    India possesses a network of rural schools in which English is\r\n    taught. These schools are due to the enterprise of the _bhadralok_\r\n    and to the fact that, as British rule gradually spread from Bengal\r\n    over Northern India, the scope of employment for English-educated\r\n    Bengalis spread with it. Originally they predominated in all\r\n    offices and higher grade schools throughout Upper India. They were\r\n    also, with the Parsees, the first Indians to send their sons to\r\n    England for education, to qualify for the Bar, or to compete for\r\n    the higher grades of the Civil and Medical services. When,\r\n    however, similar classes in other provinces also acquired a\r\n    working knowledge of English, the field for Bengali enterprise\r\n    gradually shrank. In their own province _bhadralok_ still almost\r\n    monopolize the clerical and subordinate administrative services of\r\n    Government. They are prominent in medicine, in teaching and at the\r\n    Bar. But, in spite of these advantages, they have felt the\r\n    shrinkage of foreign employment; and as the education which they\r\n    receive is generally literary and ill-adapted to incline the\r\n    youthful mind to industrial, commercial or agricultural pursuits,\r\n    they have not succeeded in finding fresh outlets for their\r\n    energies. Their hold on land, too, has weakened, owing to\r\n    increasing pressure of population and excessive sub-infeudation.\r\n    _Altogether their economic prospects have narrowed, and the\r\n    increasing numbers who draw fixed incomes have felt the pinch of\r\n    rising prices. On the other hand, the memories and associations\r\n    of their earlier prosperity, combined with growing contact with\r\n    Western ideas and standards of comfort, have raised their\r\n    expectations of the pecuniary remuneration which should reward a\r\n    laborious and, to their minds, a costly education._ Thus as\r\n    _bhadralok_ learned in English have become more and more numerous,\r\n    a growing number have become less and less inclined to accept the\r\n    conditions of life in which they found themselves on reaching\r\n    manhood. _Bhadralok_ have always been prominent among the\r\n    supporters of Indian political movements; and their leaders have\r\n    watched with careful attention events in the world outside India.\r\n    The large majority of the people of Bengal are not _bhadralok_ but\r\n    cultivators, and in the eastern districts mainly Muhammadans; but\r\n    the cultivators of the province are absorbed in their own\r\n    pursuits, in litigation, and in religious and caste observances.\r\n    It was not to them but to his own class that Barendra appealed.\r\n    When he renewed his efforts in 1904, the thoughts of many members\r\n    of this class had been stirred by various powerful influences.\"\r\n    [The italics are ours.]\r\n\r\nWe have given this lengthy extract as it shows conclusively (_a_) that\r\nthe movement originated and spread among people who had received Western\r\neducation, most of the leaders having been educated in England and (_b_)\r\nthat the root cause of the movement was _economic_.\r\n\r\n(3) That various circumstances occasioned by certain Government measures\r\n\"specially favored the development\" of the movement (p. 16). Among the\r\nmeasures specially mentioned are (_a_) the University law of Lord Curzon\r\n\"which was interpreted by politicians as designed to limit the numbers\r\nof Indians educated in English and thus to retard national advance\";\r\n(_b_) the partition of Bengal by Lord Curzon. \"It was the agitation\r\nthat attended and followed on this measure that brought previous\r\ndiscontent to a climax.\"\r\n\r\n(4) That the revolutionary movement received a substantial impetus by\r\nthe failure of constitutional agitation for the reversal of the policy\r\nthat decided on partitioning Bengal into two divisions. This failure led\r\nto two different kinds of agitation, open and secret: (_a_) open\r\neconomic defiance by _Swadeshi_ and boycott--_Swadeshi_ was the\r\naffirmative and boycott the negative form of the same movement.\r\n_Swadeshi_ enjoined the use of country made articles; boycott was\r\ndirected against English imports, (_b_) open propaganda by a more\r\noutspoken and in some instances violent press, (_c_) open control of\r\neducational agencies by means of national institutions, (_d_) open\r\nstimulus to physical education and physical culture, (_e_) nationalistic\r\ninterpretation of religious dogma and forms (open), (_f_) organization\r\nof secret societies for more violent propaganda, for learning and\r\nteaching the use of firearms, for the manufacture of bombs, for illicit\r\npurchase and stealing of firearms, for assassination and murder, (_g_)\r\nsecret attempts to tamper with the army, (_h_) conspiracies for\r\nterroristic purposes and for obtaining sinews of war by theft, robbery\r\nand extortion.\r\n\r\nThe following two extracts which the committee has taken from one of the\r\npublications of the revolutionary party called _Mukti Kon Pathe_ (what\r\nis the path of salvation) will explain clauses (_f_) and (_g_) and\r\n(_h_).\r\n\r\n    \"The book further points out that not much muscle was required to\r\n    shoot Europeans, that arms could be procured by grim\r\n    determination, and that weapons could be prepared silently in\r\n    some secret place. Indians could be sent to foreign countries to\r\n    learn the art of making weapons. The assistance of Indian soldiers\r\n    must be obtained. They must be made to understand the misery and\r\n    wretchedness of the country. The heroism of Sivaji must be\r\n    remembered. As long as revolutionary work remained in its infancy,\r\n    expenses could be met by subscriptions. But as work advanced,\r\n    money must be extracted from society by the application of force.\r\n    If the revolution is being brought about for the welfare of\r\n    society, then it is perfectly just to collect money from society\r\n    for that purpose. It is admitted that theft and dacoity are crimes\r\n    because they violate the principle of good society. But the\r\n    political dacoit is aiming at the good of society, \"so no sin but\r\n    rather virtue attaches to the destruction of this small good for\r\n    the sake of some higher good. Therefore if revolutionaries extort\r\n    money from the miserly or luxurious members of society by the\r\n    application of force, their conduct is perfectly just.\"\r\n\r\n    _Mukti Kon Pathe_ further exhorts its readers to obtain the \"help\r\n    of the native soldiers.... Although these soldiers for the sake of\r\n    their stomach accept service in the Government of the ruling\r\n    power, still they are nothing but men made of flesh and blood.\r\n    They, too, know (how) to think; when therefore the revolutionaries\r\n    explain to them the woes and miseries of the country, they, in\r\n    proper time, swell the ranks of the revolutionaries with arms and\r\n    weapons given them by the ruling power.... Because it is possible\r\n    to persuade the soldiers in this way, the modern English Raj of\r\n    India does not allow the cunning Bengalis to enter into the ranks\r\n    of the army.... Aid in the shape of arms may be secretly obtained\r\n    by securing the help of the foreign ruling powers.\"\r\n\r\n(5) That except in five cases the idea of private gain never entered\r\ninto the activities of the revolutionaries and of the five persons\r\nreferred to three were taxi-cab drivers either hired or coerced to\r\ncoöperate in revolutionary enterprise (p. 20).\r\n\r\n(6) That \"the circumstances that robberies and murders are being\r\ncommitted by young men of respectable extraction, students at schools\r\nand colleges, is indeed an amazing phenomenon the occurrence of which in\r\nmost countries would be hardly credible.\"\r\n\r\n(7) That \"since the year 1906 revolutionary outrages in Bengal have\r\nnumbered 210 and attempts at committing such outrages have amounted to\r\n101. Definite information is in the hands of the police of the\r\ncomplicity of no less than 1038 persons in these offences. But of these,\r\nonly 84 persons have been convicted of specified crimes in 39\r\nprosecutions, and of these persons, 30 were tried by tribunals\r\nconstituted under the Defence of India Act. Ten attempts have been made\r\nto strike at revolutionary conspiracies by means of prosecutions\r\ndirected against groups or branches. In these prosecutions 192 persons\r\nwere involved, 63 of whom were convicted. Eighty-two revolutionaries\r\nhave rendered themselves liable to be bound over to be of good behaviour\r\nunder the preventive sections of the Criminal Procedure Code. In regard\r\nto 51 of these, there is direct evidence of complicity in outrages.\r\nThere have, moreover, been 59 prosecutions under the Arms and Explosives\r\nActs which have resulted in convictions of 58 persons.\"\r\n\r\nWe wish the committee had also supplemented this information by a\r\ncomplete record of the punishments that were imposed on persons\r\nconvicted of revolutionary crime in the ten years from 1906 to 1917. We\r\nare sure such a statement would have been most informing and\r\nilluminating. It would have conclusively established the soundness of\r\nthe half-hearted finding that \"the convictions ... did not have as much\r\neffect as might have been expected in repressing crime.\" In fact they\r\nhad no effect. They only added fuel to the fire.\r\n\r\n(8) That persons involved in revolutionary crime belonged to all castes\r\nand occupations and the vast bulk of them were non-Brahmins. They were\r\nof all ages, from 10-15 to over 45, the majority being under 25. The\r\ncommittee has in an appendix (p. 93) given three tables of statistics as\r\nto age, caste, occupation or profession of persons convicted in Bengal\r\nof revolutionary crimes or killed in commission of such crimes during\r\nthe years 1907-1917. This clause is based on these statistics.\r\n\r\nWe are afraid, however, that these statistics do not afford quite a\r\ncorrect index of the age, caste, occupation and position of all the\r\npeople in Bengal that were and are sympathetically interested in the\r\nrevolutionary movement of Bengal.\r\n\r\nIn investigating reasons for failure of ordinary machinery for the\r\nprevention, detection and punishment of crime in Bengal, the committee\r\nhas assigned six reasons: (_a_) want of evidence, (_b_) paucity of\r\npolice, (_c_) facilities enjoyed by criminals, (_d_) difficulty in proof\r\nof possession of arms, etc., (_e_) distrust of evidence, (_f_) the\r\nuselessness, in general, of confession made to the Police. These\r\nreasons, however, do not represent the whole truth. Some of the most\r\ndaring crimes were committed in broad daylight, in much frequented\r\nstreets of the metropolis and in the presence of numerous people.\r\nMoreover, the Government did not depend on ordinary law. Measure after\r\nmeasure was enacted to expedite and facilitate convictions.\r\nExtraordinary provisions were made to meet all the difficulties pointed\r\nout by the committee and extraordinary sentences were given in the case\r\nof conviction. Yet the Government failed either to extirpate the\r\nmovement or to check it effectively or to bring the majority of\r\noffenders to book.\r\n\r\nThe members of the committee have frankly admitted: \"That we do not\r\nexpect very much from punitive measures. The conviction of offenders\r\nwill never check such a movement as that which grew up in Bengal unless\r\nthe leaders can be convicted at the outset.\" They pin their faith on\r\n\"preventive\" measures recommended by them. It was perhaps not within\r\ntheir scope to say that the most effective preventive measure was the\r\nremoval of the political and economic causes that had generated the\r\nmovement. The committee has studiously avoided discussing that important\r\npoint, but now and then they have incidentally furnished the real clue\r\nto the situation. Discussing the \"accessibility of Bengal schools and\r\ncolleges to Revolutionary influences,\" they quote a passage from one of\r\nthe reports of the Director of Public Instruction in Bengal. We copy\r\nbelow the whole of this paragraph, as, to us, it seems to be very\r\npertinent to the issue.\r\n\r\n    \"_Accessibility of Bengal Schools and Colleges to Revolutionary\r\n    Influences._--Abundant evidence has compelled us to the conclusion\r\n    that the secondary English schools, and in a less degree the\r\n    colleges, of Bengal have been regarded by the revolutionaries as\r\n    their most fruitful recruiting centres. Dispersed as these\r\n    schools are far and wide throughout the Province, sometimes\r\n    clustering in a town, sometimes isolated in the far-away villages\r\n    of the eastern water-country, they form natural objects for\r\n    attack; and as is apparent from the reports of the Department of\r\n    Public Instruction, they have been attacked for years with no\r\n    small degree of success. In these reports the Director has from\r\n    time to time noticed such matters as the circulation of seditious\r\n    leaflets, the number of students implicated in conspiracy cases\r\n    and the apathy of parents and guardians. But perhaps his most\r\n    instructive passages are the following, in which he sets out the\r\n    whole situation in regard to secondary English schools. 'The\r\n    number of these schools,' he wrote, 'is rapidly increasing, and\r\n    the cry is for more and more. It is a demand for tickets in a\r\n    lottery, the prizes of which are posts in Government service and\r\n    employment in certain professions. _The bhadralok have nothing to\r\n    look to but these posts_, while those who desire to rise from a\r\n    lower social or economic station have their eyes on the same goal.\r\n    _The middle classes in Bengal are generally poor, and the\r\n    increased stress of competition and the tendency for the average\r\n    earnings of certain careers to decrease_--a tendency which is\r\n    bound to follow on the increased demand to enter them, _coupled\r\n    with the rise in the cost of living and the inevitable raising in\r\n    the standard of comfort--all these features continue to make the\r\n    struggle to exist in these classes keener_. Hence the need to\r\n    raise educational standards, to make school life a greater\r\n    influence for good and the course of instruction more thorough and\r\n    more comprehensive. A need which becomes more and more imperative\r\n    as life in India becomes more complicated and more exacting is\r\n    confronted by a determined though perfectly natural opposition to\r\n    the raising of fees.... _Probably the worst feature of the\r\n    situation is the low wages and the complete absence of prospects\r\n    which are the fate of teachers in the secondary schools...._ It is\r\n    easy to blame the parents for blindness to their sons' true good,\r\n    but the matriculation examination is the thing that seems to\r\n    matter, so that if his boy passes the annual promotion\r\n    examinations and is duly presented at that examination at the\r\n    earliest possible date, the average parent has no criticism to\r\n    offer. This is perfectly natural, but the future of Bengal depends\r\n    to a not inconsiderable extent on the work done in its secondary\r\n    schools, and more is required of these institutions than an\r\n    ability to pass a certain proportion of boys through the Calcutta\r\n    University Matriculation examination.... The present condition of\r\n    secondary schools is undoubtedly prejudicing the development of\r\n    the presidency and is by no means a negligible feature in the\r\n    existing state of general disturbance. It is customary to trace\r\n    the genesis of much sedition and crime to the back streets and\r\n    lanes of Calcutta and Dacca, where the organizers of anarchic\r\n    conspiracies seek their agents from among University students.\r\n    This view is correct as far as it goes, but it is in the high\r\n    schools, with their underpaid and discontented teachers, their\r\n    crowded, dark and ill-ventilated classrooms, and their\r\n    soul-destroying process of unceasing cram, that the seeds of\r\n    discontent and fanaticism are sown.\" [The italics are ours.]\r\n\r\nYet for years nothing was done to improve education, to make it\r\npractical and creative and productive. In fact nothing has been done up\r\ntill now.\r\n\r\nLet the reader read with this the report of the Indian Industrial\r\nCommission recently issued under the authority of the Government of\r\nIndia and he will at once find the true causes which underlie the\r\nrevolutionary movement in India. These causes are not in any way\r\npeculiar to Bengal or to the Punjab; they are common to the whole of\r\nIndia, but they have found a fruitful soil in these provinces on account\r\nof the rather intense natures of the people of these two provinces. The\r\nBengali is an intensely patriotic and emotional being, very sensitive\r\nand very resentful; the Punjabee is intensely virile, passionate and\r\nplucky, having developed a strong, forceful character by centuries of\r\nresistance to all kind of invasions and attacks. Of the Punjab, however,\r\nwe will speak later on. For the present we are concerned with Bengal\r\nonly. The amazing phenomenon mentioned by the committee on p. 20 and\r\nreferred to by us before is easily explained by the facts hinted in the\r\nDirectors' report quoted above. And this notwithstanding the fact that\r\nin the matter of Government patronage Bengal has been the most favored\r\nprovince in India, throughout the period of British rule. To the\r\nBengalis have gone all the first appointments to offices that were\r\nthrown open to the natives of the soil. They have been the recipients of\r\nthe highest honors from the Government. Bengal is virtually the only\r\nprovince permanently settled where the Government cannot add to the Land\r\ntax fixed in 1793. The Bengalis are the people who spread over India,\r\nwith every territorial extension of the British Raj. They have been the\r\npampered and favored children of the Government and for very good\r\nreasons, too. They are the best educated and the most intelligent of all\r\nthe Indian peoples. They know how to adapt themselves to all conditions\r\nand circumstances, they know how to enjoy and also how to suffer. They\r\nhave subtle brains and supple bodies. The British Government could not\r\ndo without them. It cannot do without them even now. Yet it was this\r\nmost loyal and most dutiful, this most westernized and the best educated\r\nclass which laid the foundations of the revolutionary movement and has\r\nbeen carrying it on _successfully_ in face of all the forces of such a\r\nmighty Government as that of the British in India. What is the reason?\r\nIt is the utter economic helplessness of the younger generation, aided\r\nby a sense of extreme humiliation and degradation. The Government never\r\nearnestly applied itself to the solution of the problem. They did\r\nnothing to reduce poverty and make education practical. Every time the\r\nbudget was discussed the Indian members pressed for increased\r\nexpenditure on education. All their proposals and motions were rejected\r\nby the standing official majorities backed by the whole force of\r\nnon-official Europeans including the missionaries. The Government thus\r\ndeliberately sowed the wind. Is there any wonder that it is now reaping\r\nthe whirlwind?\r\n\r\nThe cause is economic; the remedy must be economic. Make education\r\npractical, foster industries, open all Government careers to the sons of\r\nthe soil, reduce the cost on the military and civil services, let the\r\npeople determine the fiscal policy of the country and the revolutionary\r\nmovement will subside. Die it will not, so long as there is foreign\r\ndomination and foreign exploitation. Even after India has attained Home\r\nRule it will not die. It has come to stay. India is a part of the world\r\nand revolution is in the air all the world over. The effort to kill it\r\nby repression and suppression is futile, unwise and stupid.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The beginnings of British rule in India were made in 1757 A.D.\r\n\r\n[2] Since enacted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nTHE PUNJAB\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may now consider the case of the Punjab. Lord Morley's verdict\r\nnotwithstanding, it is abundantly clear that the troubles of 1907, with\r\nwhich the history of unrest in the Punjab begins, were principally\r\nagrarian in their origin. Lord Morley's speech in the House of Commons\r\n(in 1907) as to the root of the trouble was based on reports supplied to\r\nhim by the Government of the Punjab and we know from personal knowledge\r\nhow unreliable many of these reports are. We may here illustrate this\r\npoint by a few extracts from these documents.\r\n\r\n    (1) Lord Morley stated that: \"There were twenty-eight meetings\r\n    known to have been held by the leading agitators in the Punjab\r\n    between 1st March and 1st May. Of these five only related, even\r\n    ostensibly, to agricultural grievances; the remaining twenty-three\r\n    were all purely political.\"\r\n\r\nThe number of meetings held from March 1 to May 1, 1907 was, at the\r\nlowest calculation, at least double of 28, or perhaps treble, and _most\r\nof them_ related \"even ostensibly to agricultural grievances\"; the\r\nnumber of purely political meetings could not have exceeded ten or\r\ntwelve.\r\n\r\n(2) On p. 61 the committee writes that \"Chatarji's father too had\r\nordered him home on discovering that he was staying with Hardayal in the\r\nhouse of Lajpat Rai.\" The whole of this statement is absolutely false. I\r\nam prepared to swear and to prove that Chatarji did not stay in my house\r\neven for a single night. He came there a few times with Hardayal.\r\nHardayal was at that time living in a house he had rented for himself in\r\nthe native city about one mile from my place which is in the Civil\r\nStation on the Lower Mall.\r\n\r\nOn the same page the committee has approvingly quoted a sentence from\r\nthe judgment of the Sessions Judge in the Delhi Conspiracy Case.\r\nSpeaking of Amir Chand, one of the accused in that case who was\r\nsentenced to death, the Sessions Judge describes him as \"one who spent\r\nhis life in furthering murderous schemes which he was too timid to carry\r\nout himself.\" Now I happen to have known this man for about 20 years\r\nbefore his conviction. I have no doubt that he was rightly convicted in\r\nthis case but I have no doubt also that this description of him by the\r\nSessions Judge was absolutely wrong. Up till 1910 the man had led an\r\nabsolutely harmless life, helping students in their studies and\r\notherwise rendering assistance, according to his means, to other needy\r\npeople. No one ever credited him with violent views. His revolutionary\r\ncareer began in 1908. Before that he could not and would not have\r\ntolerated even the killing of an ant, much less that of human beings.\r\n\r\nIn governments by bureaucracies one of the standing formulas of official\r\netiquette is never to question the findings of facts arrived at by your\r\nsuperiors or predecessors. This naturally leads to the perpetuation of\r\nmistakes. A wrong conclusion once accepted continues to be good for all\r\ntimes to come. The Rowlatt Committee has studiously acted on that\r\nformula throughout its present inquiry. They have invariably accepted\r\nthe findings of executive and judicial authorities preceding them about\r\nthe incidents that happened since 1907, without making any independent\r\ninquiry of their own. Hence their opinion about the original or the\r\nprincipal cause of the unrest of 1907 in the Punjab is not entitled to\r\ngreater weight than that of the Punjab officials whose mishandling of\r\nthe affairs of the province produced the unrest. One ounce of fact,\r\nhowever, is of greater weight in the determination of issues than even a\r\nhundred theories. The fact that the Government of India _had_ to veto\r\nthe Punjab Government's Land Colonies Act in order to allay the unrest\r\nproves conclusively that the unrest was due to agrarian trouble.\r\n\r\nThe unrest of 1907 subsided after the repeal of the land legislation of\r\n1907, but the legacy it left is still operative.\r\n\r\nThe Sikhs and the Mussulmans of the Punjab, as well as the military\r\nclasses among the Hindus, the Rajputs and the Jats, are the most virile\r\nportions of the population. They have fought the battles of the Empire.\r\nIn the interests of the Empire they have travelled far and wide. Yet we\r\nfind that educationally, as well as economically, they have suffered\r\nmost. They have the largest numbers of illiterates among them. They are\r\nthe least developed and the least progressive of all the classes in the\r\nPunjab. They are heavily in debt. The Government has occasionally\r\nrecognised it and has tried to satisfy them by preferential treatment\r\nin the filling of Government posts, or in the bestowal of titles or in\r\nnominating their supposed leaders to Legislative Councils. These\r\nridiculous palliative measures, however, have failed in their objective.\r\nThe classes disaffected do not get any satisfaction by these palliative\r\nmeasures. They need opportunities of education and economic betterment.\r\nThese could not be provided without making education general and without\r\na more equitable distribution of land among the agricultural classes and\r\nthe inauguration of industries other than agriculture. This the\r\nGovernment never cared to do. The Sikhs and the Mussulmans naturally\r\ndirected their attention to emigration.\r\n\r\nThe opportunities they found in other parts of the Empire whetted their\r\nappetites. They compared the conditions abroad with conditions at home\r\nand drew their own conclusions. Having helped in the expansion and\r\ndevelopment of the Empire they thought they were entitled to benefit\r\ntherefrom. They demanded fair treatment. Instead they found the doors\r\nshut upon them. Even those that had been admitted were made to feel the\r\nhumiliation of their position. Deliberate, active, concerted measures\r\nwere taken to drive them away or to make life for them intolerable.\r\nTheir wives and children were refused admittance and various pretexts\r\nwere invented to keep them out or to drive them away. The revolutionary\r\nmovement in the Punjab amounted to nothing until it was reinforced by\r\nthe return of the Sikh members of the Ghadr party during the war. The\r\nCommittee has failed to answer the question: Why did the Sikhs of\r\nVancouver and California readily fall in with the schemes of Hardayal\r\nand Barkat Ullah, the alleged founders of the revolutionary party of\r\nCalifornia? These latter had nothing in common with the Sikhs. In\r\nlanguage and religion, by habits and associations, they were poles apart\r\nfrom each other. Why did then Hardayal's propaganda find such a ready\r\nsoil among the Sikhs of Vancouver B. C. We quote from the report:\r\n\r\n    \"The doctrines which he preached and circulated had reached the\r\n    Sikhs and other Indians resident in British Columbia. At a meeting\r\n    in Vancouver in December, 1913, a poem from the Ghadr newspaper\r\n    was read, in which the Hindus were urged to expel the British from\r\n    India. The main grievance of the Vancouver Indians was the\r\n    Canadian immigration law under which every intending Asiatic\r\n    immigrant, with a few particular exceptions, has to satisfy the\r\n    Canadian authorities that he is in possession of 200 dollars and\r\n    has travelled by a _continuous_[1] journey on a through ticket\r\n    from his native country to Canada. In 1913 three Sikh delegates\r\n    visited the Punjab. They had come from America and were members of\r\n    the Ghadr party who had come to reconnoitre the position. Their\r\n    real purpose was recognised after their departure. They addressed\r\n    meetings at various towns on the subject of the grievances of\r\n    Indians in Canada and caused resolutions of protest to be passed\r\n    in which all communities joined.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, tracing the origin of the Budge-Budge riot, the Committee\r\nremarks:\r\n\r\n    \"The central figure in the narrative is a certain Gurdit Singh, a\r\n    Sikh of the Amritsar district in the Punjab, who had emigrated\r\n    from India 15 years before, and had for some time carried on\r\n    business as a contractor in Singapore and the Malay States. There\r\n    is reason to believe that he returned to this country about 1909.\r\n    He was certainly absent from Singapore for a space; and when he\r\n    returned there, going on to Hong Kong, he interested himself in\r\n    chartering a ship for the conveyance of Punjabis to Canada.\r\n    Punjabis, and especially Sikhs, frequently seek employment in the\r\n    Far East, and have for some time been tempted by the higher wages\r\n    procurable in Canada. But their admission to that country is to\r\n    some extent impeded by the immigration laws which we have\r\n    described already.\r\n\r\n    \"There were already in Canada about 4,000 Indians, chiefly\r\n    Punjabis. Some of these were revolutionists of the Hardayal\r\n    school, some were loyal, and some had migrated from the United\r\n    States on account of labour differences there. The Committee of\r\n    Enquiry, which subsequently investigated the whole affair,\r\n    considered that Gurdit Singh's action had been much influenced by\r\n    advice and encouragement received from Indian residents in Canada.\r\n    At any rate, after failing to secure a ship at Calcutta, he\r\n    chartered a Japanese vessel named the _Komagata Maru_ through a\r\n    German agent at Hong Kong. He issued tickets and took in\r\n    passengers at that post, at Shanghai, at Moji and at Yokohama. He\r\n    certainly knew what the Canadian law was, but perhaps hoped to\r\n    evade it by means of some appeal to the courts or by exercising\r\n    political pressure. It is equally certain that many of his\r\n    passengers had no clear comprehension of their prospects. The\r\n    Tribunal that subsequently tried the first batch of Lahore\r\n    conspirators held that probably Gurdit Singh's main object was to\r\n    cause an inflammatory episode, as one of the witnesses stated that\r\n    Gurdit Singh told his followers that should they be refused\r\n    admission, they would return to India to expel the British. On\r\n    April the 4th, 1914, the _Komagata Maru_ sailed from Hong Kong. On\r\n    the 23rd of May the _Komagata Maru_ arrived at Vancouver with 351\r\n    Sikhs and 21 Punjabi Muhammadans on board. The local authorities\r\n    refused to allow landing except in a very few cases, as the\r\n    immigrants had not complied with the requirements of the law.\r\n    Protests were made, and, while negotiations were proceeding, a\r\n    balance of 22,000 dollars still due for the hire of the ship was\r\n    paid by Vancouver Indians, and the charter was transferred to two\r\n    prominent malcontents.... A body of police was sent to enforce the\r\n    orders of the Canadian Government that the vessel should leave;\r\n    but with the assistance of firearms, the police were beaten off,\r\n    and it was only when a Government vessel was requisitioned with\r\n    armed force that the _Komagata Maru_ passengers, who had prevented\r\n    their Captain from weighing anchor or getting up steam, were\r\n    brought to terms. On the 23rd of July they started on their return\r\n    journey with an ample stock of provisions allowed them by the\r\n    Canadian Government. _They were by this time in a very bad temper\r\n    as many had staked all their possessions on this venture, and had\r\n    started in the full belief that the British Government would\r\n    assure and guarantee their admission to a land of plenty._ This\r\n    temper had been greatly aggravated by direct revolutionary\r\n    influences....\r\n\r\n    \"During the return voyage the War broke out. On hearing at\r\n    Yokohama that his ship's company would not be allowed to land at\r\n    Hong Kong, Gurdit Singh replied that they were perfectly willing\r\n    to go to any port in India if provisions were supplied. The\r\n    British Consul at Yokohama declined to meet his demands, which\r\n    were exorbitant; but the consul at Kobe was more compliant, and\r\n    after telegraphic communication between Japan and India, the\r\n    _Komagata Maru_ started for Calcutta. At neither Hong Kong nor\r\n    Singapore were the passengers allowed to land. This added to their\r\n    annoyance, as, according to the findings of the Committee, many\r\n    had not wished to return to India at all.\"\r\n\r\n    The Committee found that most of the passengers were disposed to\r\n    blame the Government of India for all their misfortunes. \"It is\r\n    well known,\" states the Report, \"that the average Indian makes no\r\n    distinction between the Government of the United Kingdom, that of\r\n    Canada, and that of British India, or that of any colony. To him\r\n    these authorities are all one and the same. And this view of the\r\n    whole _Komagata Maru_ business was by no means confined to the\r\n    passengers on the ship. It inspired some Sikhs of the Punjab with\r\n    the idea that the Government was biased against them; and it\r\n    strengthened the hands of the Ghadr revolutionaries who were\r\n    urging Sikhs abroad to return to India and join the mutiny which,\r\n    they asserted, was about to begin. Numbers of emigrants listened\r\n    to such calls and hastened back to India from Canada, the United\r\n    States, the Philippines, Hong Kong and China.\" [The italics are\r\n    ours.]\r\n\r\nWe have given this extract to show the real cause of the growth of the\r\nrevolutionary movement among the Sikhs. Let the reader omit, if he can,\r\nfor a moment, all references to active revolutionary propaganda and he\r\nwill find that the underlying cause of this trouble was _economic_. Why\r\ndid the Sikhs want to emigrate to Canada? Why did they stake all their\r\npossessions on the venture? Why were they unwilling to return to India\r\nat all? Because the economic conditions at home were so bad and the\r\nprospects abroad so good. At home their lands were not sufficient to\r\nabsorb all their energies, the income was not sufficient to keep body\r\nand soul together and, in a majority of cases, what they made from land\r\nwas hardly more than sufficient to pay Land Revenue to the Government\r\nand interest to the money-lender. There was nothing to bind them to\r\ntheir homes except the love of home land and the domestic ties. These\r\nmelted away in the presence of dire necessity. In extreme need they\r\nleft their homes to make more money to be able to pay their debts, to\r\nredeem their lands, if possible to purchase more land and to make life\r\nbearable and tolerable. When they came in the open world they found\r\ninsurmountable barriers between them and plenty. They had helped in\r\nmaking the empire; the empire had enough land for all her sons and\r\ndaughters; men were urgently needed to bring land into cultivation and\r\notherwise to develop the empire; men of other races and colours were not\r\nonly welcome but were being induced to come and settle by offers of all\r\nkinds. They, and they alone, were unwelcome and barred.\r\n\r\nAdd to this the attitude and the record of the Punjab Government towards\r\npolitical agitation and political agitators, to use their own favorite\r\nexpressions. The Punjab Government was the first to resuscitate the old\r\nRegulation III of 1818 for the purpose of scotching a legitimate\r\nagitation against an obnoxious legislative measure. A wise and sagacious\r\nGovernment would have dropped the legislation which it was eventually\r\nfound necessary to veto to maintain peace. The deportations drove the\r\nseeds of unrest deeper. The other contributory causes may be thus summed\r\nup:\r\n\r\n(1) The Punjab Government has been the most relentless of all local\r\ngovernments in India in suppressing freedom of speech and press.\r\n\r\n(2) The Punjab Government at one time was very foolishly zealous in\r\npersecuting the Arya Samajists and in making a mountain out of a\r\nmolehill about the letters found in the possession of Parmanand.\r\n\r\n(3) The sentences which the Punjab Courts have passed in cases of\r\nseditious libel are marked by such brutality as to make them notably\r\nunique in the history of criminal administration in India.\r\n\r\n(4) The strangulation of all open political life by direct and indirect\r\nrepression led to the adoption of secret methods.\r\n\r\n(5) The sentences passed in the Delhi Conspiracy case were much more\r\nsevere than those given in Bengal in similar cases. In this case four\r\nmen were hanged, two of them only because of membership in the secret\r\nconspiracy and not for actual participation in the outrage that was the\r\nsubject of the charge, and two others were sentenced to seven years\r\nrigorous imprisonment each.\r\n\r\n(6) The Budge-Budge riot and the considerable loss of life that resulted\r\ntherefrom was another case of stupid management and utter incapacity to\r\nhandle a delicate situation.\r\n\r\n(7) For the Lahore Conspiracy 28 persons were hanged, and about 90\r\nsentenced to long terms of imprisonment and transportation for life. But\r\nfor the interference of Lord Hardinge the hangings would have exceeded\r\n50. In addition some mutinous soldiers of two regiments were tried by\r\nCourt Martial and a few murderous robbers and train-wreckers were dealt\r\nwith by the ordinary courts. The reader may well compare this with the\r\nrecord of convictions relating to Bengal.\r\n\r\nNow, we have not the slightest intention of justifying the conduct of\r\nthose who conspired to overthrow the Government by force, or who\r\ncommitted murders, robberies or other offences in the furtherance of\r\nthat design. In our judgment only madmen, ignorant of the conditions of\r\ntheir country, could have been guilty of such crimes. Nor are we\r\ninclined to blame the Government much for the sharp steps they took to\r\npreserve order and maintain their authority during the war. But, after\r\nall has been said, we must reiterate that the underlying causes were\r\neconomic and were the direct result of Government policy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] There never was a continuous steamer service between India and\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR REPRESSIVE LEGISLATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Committee has said all that it could against individual publicists,\r\nIndian public movements and the native press. They have found no fault\r\nwith the Anglo-Indian press and the Government. The whole force of their\r\njudicial acumen has been applied in recommending fresh measures of\r\nrepression and suppression which they have divided into two kinds:\r\n\r\n    Punitive Measures, Permanent, (_a_) Points of General Application.\r\n    The measures which we shall submit are of two kinds, viz.,\r\n    Punitive, by which term we mean measures better to secure the\r\n    conviction and punishment of offenders, and Preventive, i.e.,\r\n    measures to check the spread of conspiracy and the commission of\r\n    crime.\r\n\r\n    We may say at once that we do not expect very much from punitive\r\n    measures.[1] The conviction of offenders will never check such a\r\n    movement as that which grew up in Bengal unless all the leaders\r\n    can be convicted at the outset. Further, the real difficulties\r\n    have been the scarcity of evidence due to various causes and the\r\n    want of reliance whether justified or not, on such evidence as\r\n    there has been. The last difficulty is fundamental and cannot be\r\n    remedied. No law can direct a court to be convinced when it is\r\n    not.\r\n\r\n    Punitive Measures (Permanent).\r\n\r\n    Legislation directed better to secure the punishment of seditious\r\n    crime may take the shape either--\r\n\r\n    (_a_) of changes in the general law of evidence or procedure which\r\n    if sound would be advisable in regard to all crime, or\r\n\r\n    (_b_) changes in the substantive law of sedition or modifications\r\n    in the rules of evidence and procedure in such cases designed to\r\n    deal with the special features of that class of offence.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation under (_a_) does not amount to much and we will not\r\nmention it.\r\n\r\nUnder (_b_) they recommend:\r\n\r\n    In the first place we think that a permanent enactment on the\r\n    lines of Rule 25A under the Defence of India Act is required. That\r\n    rule provides for the punishment of persons having prohibited\r\n    documents (which may have to be defined anew) in their possession\r\n    or control with (as we read the effect of the words used) intent\r\n    to publish or circulate them....\r\n\r\n    We also recommend that the principle of section 565 of the Code of\r\n    Criminal Procedure (which provides for an order requiring\r\n    notification of residence after release in the case of persons\r\n    convicted a second time for certain offences) should be extended\r\n    to all persons convicted of offences under Chapter VI of the Penal\r\n    Code (offences against the State) whether previously convicted or\r\n    not. Such persons might be ordered to give security for a period\r\n    not exceeding two years for good behaviour so far as offences\r\n    under Chapter VI are concerned, and in default be directed to\r\n    notify their residence to Government, who should have power to\r\n    restrict their movements for the period of two years after their\r\n    release and prohibit them from addressing public meetings,--the\r\n    term \"public meetings\" including in its scope political subjects\r\n    as in section 4 of the Prevention of Seditious Meetings Act of\r\n    1907.\r\n\r\n    Lastly, we think that in all cases where there is a question of\r\n    seditious intent, evidence of previous conviction for seditious\r\n    crime or association (of an incriminating kind, of course) with\r\n    persons so convicted should be admissible upon written notice to\r\n    the accused with such particulars and at such a time before the\r\n    evidence is given as might be fair. What we have called seditious\r\n    crime would of course have to be accurately defined.\r\n\r\nNow it is evident that after such legislation all liberty of speech and\r\naction becomes extinct. These recommendations will we fear directly lead\r\nto secret propaganda and secret action.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of emergency punitive measures the committee recommends:\r\n\r\n    Emergency Provisions for Trials. Coming now to the measures\r\n    themselves, we are of opinion that provision should be made for\r\n    the trial of seditious crime by Benches of three Judges without\r\n    juries or assessors and without preliminary commitment proceedings\r\n    or appeal. In short, the procedure we recommend should follow the\r\n    lines laid down in sections 5-9 inclusive of the Defence of India\r\n    Act. It should be made clear that section 512 of the Code of\r\n    Criminal Procedure (relating to the giving in evidence under\r\n    certain circumstances of depositions taken in the absence of an\r\n    absconding accused) applies to these trials, it having, we\r\n    understand, been questioned whether section 7 of the Defence of\r\n    India Act has that effect.\r\n\r\n    We think it necessary to exclude juries and assessors mainly\r\n    because of the terrorism to which they are liable. But terrorism\r\n    apart, we do not think that they can be relied upon in this class\r\n    of cases. They are too much inclined to be affected by public\r\n    discussion.\r\n\r\nWe omit the detailed discussion of these provisions in which the\r\ncommittee has attempted to soften the sting of these recommendations by\r\ngiving their reasons and by suggesting certain safeguards against their\r\nabuse. The most startling of their recommendations are however made\r\nunder the head of emergency preventive measures.\r\n\r\n    Emergency Preventive Measures. We have been forced to the\r\n    conclusion that it is necessary, in order to keep the conspiracies\r\n    already described under control in the future, to provide for the\r\n    continuance after the expiry of the Defence of India Act (though\r\n    in the contingent form explained and under important limitations)\r\n    of some of the powers which that measure introduced in a temporary\r\n    form. By those means alone has the conspiracy been paralysed for\r\n    the present and we are unable to devise any expedient operating\r\n    according to strict judicial forms which can be relied upon to\r\n    prevent its reviving to check it if it does revive, or, in the\r\n    last resort, to suppress it anew. This will involve some\r\n    infringement of the rules normally safeguarding the liberty of the\r\n    subject. We have endeavored to make that infringement as small as\r\n    we think possible consistently with the production of an effective\r\n    scheme.\r\n\r\n    Existing Temporary Powers. The powers at present temporarily\r\n    possessed by the Government are so far as material for the present\r\n    purpose to be found in rules 3-7 inclusive and 12A under the\r\n    Defence of India Act, 1915. We do not refer for the present to\r\n    the Foreigners Ordinance, 1914, or the Ingress into India\r\n    Ordinance, 1914.... Shortly stated, their effect is to give power\r\n    to require persons by executive order to remain in any area to be\r\n    specified or not to enter or remain in any such area, with\r\n    penalties for breach of such requirements. These orders may be\r\n    made and served on the person affected, whereupon they become\r\n    binding upon him, or the person may be arrested without warrant\r\n    and detained for a period not exceeding in all one month, pending\r\n    an order of restriction. There is also a power of search under\r\n    search warrant. It will be observed there is no provision for an\r\n    examination of the cases of such persons. The decision lies solely\r\n    with the Local Government. There is also the power of confinement\r\n    under Regulation III of 1818.\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n    \"Two Grades of Powers Desirable.--We now proceed to elaborate ...\r\n    the scheme we suggest.\r\n\r\n    \"We think, as we have already indicated, that the powers to be\r\n    acquired should be of two grades capable of being called into\r\n    operation separately, possibly under different forms of\r\n    notification.\r\n\r\n    \"The first group of powers should be of the following nature:--\r\n\r\n    \"(i) to demand security with or without sureties;\r\n\r\n    \"(ii) to restrict residence or to require notification of change\r\n    of residence;\r\n\r\n    \"(iii) to require abstention from certain acts, such as engaging\r\n    in journalism, distributing leaflets or attending meetings;\r\n\r\n    \"(iv) to require that the person should periodically report to the\r\n    police.\r\n\r\n\"The second group of powers should be--\r\n\r\n    \"(i) to arrest;\r\n\r\n    \"(ii) to search under warrant;\r\n\r\n    \"(iii) to confine in non-penal custody.\r\n\r\n\"In Article 196 they provide \"that in respect of acts committed before\r\nthe Defence of India Act expires (or an earlier date if preferred) and\r\ndanger apprehended by reason of such acts in the future it should be\r\nlawful to proceed against any person under any of the provisions which\r\nwe have outlined without any notification. In other words, the new law\r\nis to be deemed to be operative for that purpose immediately.\"\r\n\r\nArticles 198 and 199 suggest measures for restricting \"Ingress into\r\nIndia\" and also for regulating and restricting \"Inter-Provincial\r\nMovements.\"\r\n\r\nNeed it be said that if these recommendations are accepted there will be\r\nno liberty of press or speech in India and the Reform will fail to\r\nsuppress the revolutionary movement at all. Indian opinion is unanimous\r\nin condemning these recommendations as has been proved by the unanimous\r\nopposition of all sections of Indians in the Viceroy's Legislative\r\nCouncil to the bills that have been introduced to give effect to them.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The Government of India have been on the inclined plane of\r\nrepression as a remedy of discontent, which sometimes leads to crime,\r\nfor now more than twenty years. They have in the interval placed on the\r\nStatute Book the Penal and Criminal Procedure Codes, the Post Office\r\nAmendment Acts, the Official Secrets Act, the Seditious Meetings Act,\r\nthe Incitement to Offences Act, the Criminal Law Amendment Act, the\r\nPress Act, the Conspiracy Act, and the Defence of India Act. Have they\r\nattained their object? The very introduction of the two new Bills ... is\r\nthe eloquent answer. What is it but a confession of failure?...\r\n_Leader_, Allahabad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTIONARY PARTY\r\n\r\n    Revolution is a fever brought about by the constant and reckless\r\n    disregard of the laws of health in the government of a country.\r\n\r\n                                              DAVID LLOYD GEORGE\r\n\r\n                        \"Causes and Aims of the War.\" Speech delivered\r\n                        at Glasgow, on being presented with the freedom\r\n                        of that city, June 29, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe authors of the report remark:\r\n\r\n    \"There exists a small revolutionary party deluded by hatred of\r\n    British rule and desire for the elimination of the Englishman into\r\n    the belief that the path to independence or constitutional liberty\r\n    lies through anarchical crime. Now it may be that such persons\r\n    will see for themselves the wisdom of abandoning methods which are\r\n    as futile as criminal; though if they do not, the powers of the\r\n    law are or can be made sufficient for the maintenance of order.\r\n    But the existence of such people is a warning against the possible\r\n    consequences of unrestrained agitation in India. We are justified\r\n    in calling on the political leaders, in the work of education that\r\n    they will undertake, to bear carefully in mind the political\r\n    inexperience of their hearers; and to look for further progress\r\n    not to fiery agitation which may have consequences quite beyond\r\n    their grasp, but to the machinery which we devise for the\r\n    purpose. In every country there will be persons who love agitation\r\n    for agitation's sake or to whom it appeals like an intoxicant. It\r\n    is the duty of the leaders of Indian opinion to remember the\r\n    effect on people not accustomed to weighing words of fiery and\r\n    heated speeches. Where ignorance is widespread and passions are so\r\n    easily aroused, nothing is easier than for political leaders to\r\n    excite a storm; nothing harder for them than to allay it. Breaches\r\n    of the peace or crimes of violence only put back the political\r\n    clock. Above all things, when the future of India depends upon\r\n    co-operation among all races, attacks upon one race or religion or\r\n    upon another jeopardise the whole experiment. Nor can the\r\n    condemnation of extremist and revolutionary action be left only to\r\n    the official classes. We call upon all those who claim to be\r\n    leaders to condemn with us and to support us in dealing with\r\n    methods of agitation which drive schoolboys to crime and lead to\r\n    religious and agrarian disturbance. Now that His Majesty's\r\n    Government have declared their policy, reasonable men have\r\n    something which they can oppose successfully to the excitement\r\n    created by attacks on Government and by abuse of Englishmen,\r\n    coupled with glowing and inaccurate accounts of India's golden\r\n    past and appeals to race hatred in the name of religion. Many\r\n    prominent Indians dislike and fear such methods. A new opportunity\r\n    is now being offered to combat them; and we expect them to take\r\n    it. Disorder must be prejudicial to the cause of progress and\r\n    especially disorder as a political weapon.\"\r\n\r\nWe are in general agreement with the sentiments expressed in this\r\nextract but we will be wanting in candour if we fail to point out that,\r\nthough the revolutionary movement in India is mainly political, it is\r\npartly economic and partly anarchic also. In the first two aspects it is\r\nat present the product of purely local (Indian) conditions. In the\r\nlast, it is the reaction of world forces. While we are hoping that the\r\nchange in the policy, now announced, will remove the political basis of\r\nit, we are not quite sure that that will ensure the extermination of the\r\nparty or the total destruction of the movement. The growth of democratic\r\npolitical institutions in India must inevitably be followed by a\r\nmovement for social democracy. The spirit of Revolution which is now fed\r\nby political inequalities will, when these are removed, find its\r\nsustenance in social inequalities. That movement may not be\r\nanti-British; perhaps it will not be, but that it will have some\r\nrevolutionary element in it may be assumed. The lessons of history make\r\nit clear that the most effective way to prevent its falling into\r\nchannels of violence is to have as little recourse to coercion as may be\r\nconsistent with the preservation of general order and peace. The\r\npreservation of order and the unhindered exercise of private rights by\r\nall citizens is the pre-requisite condition to good government. Every\r\ngovernment must see to it. It is their duty to use preventive as well as\r\npunitive methods. There are, however, ways of doing these things. One is\r\nthe British, the American and the French way.[1] The other is what was\r\nheretofore associated with the name of the late Czar. The third is the\r\nGerman way. We hope the lessons of Czarism will not be lost on either\r\nparty. The governments have as much to learn from it as the peoples. The\r\nbest guarantee against the abnormal growth of a revolutionary movement\r\nis to adopt and follow the British methods and to avoid scrupulously\r\nand without fail any approach to the discredited Russian or Prussian\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nThe Indian soil and the Indian atmosphere are not very congenial for\r\nrevolutionary ideas and revolutionary methods. The people are too\r\ndocile, gentle, law-abiding and spiritually inclined to take to them\r\nreadily. They are by nature and tradition neither vindictive nor\r\nrevengeful. Their general spirit is opposed to all kinds of violence.\r\nThey have little faith in the virtues of force. Unless they are\r\nprovoked, and that too terribly, and are face to face with serious\r\ndanger they do not like the use of force, even when recourse to it may\r\nbe legal and morally defensible.\r\n\r\nOne of the causes of the growth of the revolutionary movement in India\r\nhas been the insolence and the incivility of the European Community\r\ntowards the Indian Community. The charges of cowardice so often hurled\r\nagainst the Bengali have played no insignificant part in the genesis of\r\nthe Bengal revolutionary. The distinguished authors have put it rather\r\nmildly:\r\n\r\n    \"If there are Indians who really desire to see India leave the\r\n    empire, to get rid of English officers and English commerce, we\r\n    believe that among their springs of action will be found the\r\n    bitterness of feeling that has been nurtured out of some\r\n    manifestation that the Englishman does not think the Indian an\r\n    equal. Very small seeds casually thrown may result in great\r\n    harvests of political calamity. We feel that, particularly at the\r\n    present stage of India's progress, it is the plain duty of every\r\n    Englishman and woman, official and non-official, in India to avoid\r\n    the offence and the blunder of discourtesy: and none the less is\r\n    it incumbent on the educated Indian to cultivate patience and a\r\n    more generous view of what may very likely be no more than\r\n    heedlessness or difference of custom.\"\r\n\r\nWe admire the dignified way in which they have addressed their advice to\r\nthe educated Indian. But we hope they do not ignore that except in a few\r\nscattered instances heretofore the chief fault has lain with the ruling\r\nclass. The proceedings of the Royal Commission on the Public Services of\r\nIndia are full of that racial swagger which the authors of this report\r\nhave mildly condemned in the above extract and it is an open secret that\r\nthat spirit was one of the dearly cherished articles of faith with the\r\nbureaucracy. We hope the war has effected a great change in their temper\r\nand both parties will be disposed to profit from the advice given to\r\nthem in the report.\r\n\r\nAs to the duty of the educated leaders in the matter of suppressing the\r\ngrowth of the revolutionary movement in future, we beg to point out that\r\nall depends on how much faith the governing classes place in the\r\nprofessions of the popular leaders. Open public speeches and meetings\r\nappealing to racial or religious animosities have not played any\r\nimportant part in the development of the revolutionary spirit. It is not\r\nlikely that the educated leaders will in any way consciously and\r\nvoluntarily digress from the limits of reasonable criticism of\r\nGovernment policy, nor have they very often done so in the past. What\r\nhas so far prevented the educated leaders from exercising an effective\r\ncheck on the growth of the revolutionary movement is their inability to\r\nassociate on terms of friendship with the younger generation. This has\r\nbeen due partly to a false idea of dignity and partly to the fear that\r\nany association with hot-headed young men might bring discredit on them\r\nor might land them in hot water if, sometime or other, any one of their\r\nfriends might do anything violent. Public speeches denouncing the\r\nrevolutionary propaganda and the revolutionary activities or public\r\ncondemnation of the latter in the press are good in their own way, but\r\nthey are not quite effective. The revolutionist may ascribe it to fear,\r\ntimidity, or hypocrisy. What is needed is that educated leaders of\r\ninfluence should be free to mix, socially and otherwise, with the\r\nyounger generation so as to acquire an intimate knowledge of their trend\r\nof thought and bent of mind. It is in these intimate exchanges of views\r\nthat they can most effectively exercise their powers of argument and\r\npersuasion and use their influence effectively. They will not succeed\r\nalways, but in a good many cases they will. This cannot be done,\r\nhowever, unless the Executives and the Police relax their attentions\r\ntoward them.\r\n\r\nThe bureaucrats' want of confidence in any Indian leader reached its\r\nlimit in the attentions which the agents of the secret service bestowed\r\non such men as the late Mr. Gokhale. It is an open secret that the\r\nsecret service records have assigned a particular number to every public\r\nleader in India. Religious preachers and teachers of the type of Lala\r\nHansraj and Lala Mûnshi Rám receive as much attention in the records as\r\nthe writer of this book or Mr. B. G. Tilak or Mr. Bepin Chandra Pal. The\r\n\"Servants of India\" are as much the objects of solicitation on the part\r\nof the secret service men as the members of the Arya Samaj. Of course,\r\nagitators are agitators. All the great progressive souls of the world\r\nhave had to agitate at one time or another in their lives. Agitation is\r\nthe soul of democracy. There can be no progress in a democracy without\r\nagitation. Sir Denzil Ibbetson could pay no greater compliment to the\r\nArya Samaj than by his remark in 1907 that, according to his\r\ninformation, wherever there was an Arya Samaj it was a centre of unrest.\r\nWe hope the Governments are now convinced that the Arya Samaj has never\r\nbeen revolutionary. It is one of the most conservative, restraining\r\nforces in the social life of the country. Yet it cannot be denied that\r\nits propaganda has been and will continue to be one of the most\r\ndisturbing factors in the placid waters of Indian life. The bureaucracy\r\ncould not look upon it with kindness. Any attempt to persist in this\r\nkind of control or check or persecution will be fatal to the success of\r\nthe appeal which Mr. Montagu and Lord Chelmsford have addressed to the\r\npublic men of India in the extract given above.\r\n\r\nIn our judgment the most effective way to check the growth of the\r\nrevolutionary movement is by freeing the mind of the leaders of the fear\r\nof being misunderstood if they should mix freely with the younger\r\ngeneration and yet fail to prevent some of them from becoming\r\nrevolutionists. A revolutionary prospers on exclusiveness. Secrecy is\r\nhis great ally. Cut off a young man from open, healthy influences and he\r\nwill be attracted by the mystery of secrecy. Thenceforth he is doomed.\r\nAfter that he may be weaned only by kindness and friendliness and not by\r\nthreats or persecution. Most of the youths attracted by revolutionary\r\npropaganda have proved to be quite ignorant of the real conditions of\r\ntheir country. No attempt has been made to instruct them in politics.\r\nThey have been fed on unsound history and unsound politics. Reactionary\r\nImperialism has harmed them more than exaggerated nationalism. They have\r\nhad few opportunities of discussion with people who could look upon\r\nthings in right perspective. They could not open their minds to their\r\nEuropean teachers. In the few cases in which they did they repented.\r\nSomehow or other, the free confidential talks they had with their\r\nprofessors found an entry in the police records. It brought a black mark\r\nagainst their names, to stand and mar their careers forever. The Indian\r\nteacher and professor is afraid of discussing politics with them. So\r\nthey go on unrestrained until the glamour of prospective heroism, by a\r\ndeed of violence, fascinates one of them and he is led into paths of\r\ncrimes of a most detestable kind. Unscrupulous advisors lead him toward\r\nfalsehood, hypocrisy, treachery, treason and crime by dubious methods.\r\nOne of the things they preach is that morality has nothing to do with\r\npolitics. They insinuate that the violence of militarism and Imperialism\r\ncan be effectively met and checked only by violence. Poor misguided\r\nsouls! They enforce their advice by the diplomatic history of Europe.\r\nThey forget that once a youth is led into the ways of falsehood and\r\nunscrupulousness he may as easily use it against his friends as against\r\nhis enemies. If he has no scruples about killing an enemy he may have\r\nnone about killing a friend. If he has no scruples about betraying the\r\none, he may have none about betraying the other. Once a man starts\r\ntoward moral degeneration, even for desirable or patriotic ends, there\r\nis no knowing whither his course might take him. The most idealistic\r\nyoung men starting with the highest and purest conceptions of patriotism\r\nhave been known to fall into the most ignoble methods of attacking first\r\ntheir enemies and then their friends. When they reach that stage of\r\nmoral corruption they can trust no one, can believe in the honesty of no\r\none. Their one idea of cleverness and efficiency is to conceal their\r\nmotives from everyone, to give their confidence to no one, to suspect\r\nand distrust everyone and to aspire toward the success that consists in\r\nimposing upon all.\r\n\r\nThe remedy against this lies in encouraging an open and frank discussion\r\nof politics on the part of the younger generation, with such indulgences\r\nas are due to their youth and immaturity of judgment; a systematic\r\nteaching of political history in schools and colleges; a free and open\r\nintercourse with their teachers on the clearest understanding that\r\nnothing said in discussion or in confidence will ever be used either\r\nprivately or publicly against them, and an equally free and intimate\r\nintercourse with the leaders of thought and of public life in the\r\ncountry. These latter must be freed from the attentions of the secret\r\nservice if it is intended that they should effectually coöperate in\r\ncounteracting revolutionary propaganda. Besides, the younger generation\r\nmust be brought up in habits of manly and open encounter with their\r\nadversaries, in a spirit of sport and fair play. Repression,\r\nsuppression, and suspicion do not provide a congenial climate for the\r\ndevelopment of these habits and they should be subordinated as much as\r\npossible in the present condition of chaotic conflict between social\r\ninterests and social ideals.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] By this we do not mean those that were adopted during the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapters we have embodied and discussed the important\r\nparts of the Report of Mr. Montagu and Lord Chelmsford. In this chapter\r\nwe give a summary of what they say about education. The statements of\r\nfact made by the two distinguished statesmen are so lucid and fair that\r\nwe make no apology for copying the whole article embodying the same.\r\n\r\n    \"There is, however, one aspect of the general problem of political\r\n    advance which is so important as to require notice in some detail.\r\n    We have observed already that one of the greatest obstacles to\r\n    India's political development lies not only in the lack of\r\n    education among its peoples taken as a whole, but also in the\r\n    uneven distribution of educational advance. The educational policy\r\n    of Government has incurred much criticism from different points of\r\n    view. Government is charged with neglect, because after sixty\r\n    years of educational effort only 6 per cent. of the population is\r\n    literate, while under 4 per cent. of the total population is\r\n    undergoing instruction. It is charged, on the other hand, with\r\n    having given to those classes which welcomed instruction a system\r\n    which is divorced from their needs in being purely literary, in\r\n    admitting methods of unintelligent memorising and of cramming, and\r\n    in producing, far in excess of the actual demands of Indian\r\n    conditions, a body of educated young men whose training has\r\n    prepared them only for Government service or the practice of law.\r\n    The system of university education on Western lines is\r\n    represented as cutting off the students from the normal life of\r\n    the country, and the want of connection between primary education\r\n    in the vernaculars and higher education in English is regarded as\r\n    another radical defect.\"\r\n\r\nThe period of sixty years mentioned is evidently counted from 1858, the\r\nyear in which the rule of the East India Company ceased and the Crown\r\nassumed direct responsibility for the Government of India. British rule\r\nin India however began in 1757 A.D. and the foundation of public\r\neducation in India under the British might well be considered to have\r\nbeen laid by Warren Hastings in 1781, in which year the Calcutta\r\nMadrassa was established. For a period of almost 50 years the discussion\r\nwhether the Indians should be instructed in English or not went on until\r\nit was settled in 1835 by Lord Macaulay's famous minute in favour of\r\nEnglish and the European system. In 1824 there were 14 public\r\ninstitutions in Bengal imparting education on Western lines.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, i.e., in 1824, Monstuart Elphinstone formulated a\r\nsimilar policy for the Bombay presidency.\r\n\r\nTo the remarks made in the above quotation about the extent and kind of\r\neducation imparted in India till now, the distinguished authors of the\r\nreport add:\r\n\r\n    \"From the economic point of view India had been handicapped by the\r\n    want of professional and technical instruction: her colleges turn\r\n    out numbers of young men qualified for Government clerkships while\r\n    the real interests of the country require, for example, doctors\r\n    and engineers in excess of the existing supply. The charge that\r\n    Government has produced a large _intelligentsia_ which cannot find\r\n    employment has much substance in it: it is one of the facts that\r\n    lie at the root of recent political difficulties. But it is only\r\n    of late years and as part of the remarkable awakening of national\r\n    self-consciousness, that the complaint has been heard that the\r\n    system has failed to train Indians for practical work in\r\n    manufactures, commerce, and the application of science to\r\n    industrial life.\"\r\n\r\nAfter making a few general observations on the so called difficulties in\r\nthe way of a general spread of education \"the chief needs at present\"\r\nare thus pointed out:\r\n\r\n    \"Primary education, as we have seen, is already practically in the\r\n    hands of local bodies, but secondary education was deliberately\r\n    left at the outset almost entirely to private agencies. The\r\n    universities, despite their connection with Government, are\r\n    largely non-official bodies with extensive powers.[1] The main\r\n    defect of the system is probably the want of co-ordination between\r\n    primary and higher education, which in turn reacts upon the\r\n    efficiency of the secondary institutions and to a great extent\r\n    confines university colleges to the unsatisfactory function of\r\n    mere finishing schools. The universities have suffered from having\r\n    been allowed to drift into the position of institutions that are\r\n    expected not so much to educate in the true sense as to provide\r\n    the student with the means of entering an official or a\r\n    professional career. Thus a high percentage of failures seems to a\r\n    large body of Indian opinion not so much a proof of the faultiness\r\n    of the methods of teaching as an example of an almost capricious\r\n    refusal of the means of obtaining a living wage to boys who have\r\n    worked for years often at the cost of real hardship to secure an\r\n    independent livelihood. The educational wastage is everywhere\r\n    excessive; and analysis shows that it is largely due to\r\n    under-payment and want of proper training in the case of teachers.\r\n    The actual recruits for normal schools are too often ill-prepared,\r\n    and the teaching career, which in India used formerly to command\r\n    respect, does not now offer adequate inducements to men of ability\r\n    and force of character. The first need, therefore, is the\r\n    improvement of teaching. Until that is attained it is vain to\r\n    expect that the continuation of studies from the primary stage can\r\n    be made attractive. But while the improvement of primary and\r\n    middle schools is the first step to be taken, very much remains to\r\n    be done in reorganising the secondary teachers and ensuring for\r\n    the schoolmaster a career that will satisfy an intelligent man.\r\n    The improvement of ordinary secondary education is obviously a\r\n    necessary condition for the development of technical instruction\r\n    and the reform of the university system. It is clear that there is\r\n    much scope for an efficient and highly trained inspectorate in\r\n    stimulating the work of the secondary schools and in helping the\r\n    inspectorate of the primary schools maintained by the local\r\n    bodies. We believe that the best minds in India, while they feel\r\n    that the educational service has not in the past been widely\r\n    enough opened to Indians trained at British universities, value\r\n    the maintenance of a close connection with educationists from the\r\n    United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n    \"This survey of educational problems will show how much room there\r\n    is for advance and improvement, and also how real the difficulties\r\n    are. The defects of the present system have often been discussed\r\n    in the legislative councils, but, as was inevitable so long as the\r\n    councils had no responsibility, without due appreciation of\r\n    financial difficulties, or serious consideration of the question\r\n    how far fresh taxation for educational improvement would be\r\n    acceptable. As we shall show, it is part of the political advance\r\n    that we contemplate that the direction of Indian education should\r\n    be increasingly transferred to Indian hands. Only so, we believe,\r\n    can the stimulus be forthcoming which will enable the necessary\r\n    money to be found. The weak points are recognised. A real desire\r\n    for improvement exists. Educational extension and reform must\r\n    inevitably play an important part in the political progress of the\r\n    country. We have already made clear our conviction that political\r\n    capacity can come only through the exercise of political\r\n    responsibility; and that mere education without opportunities must\r\n    result in serious mischief. But there is another important\r\n    element. Progress must depend on the growth of electorates and the\r\n    intelligent exercise of their powers; and men will be immensely\r\n    helped to become competent electors by acquiring such education as\r\n    will enable them to judge candidates for their votes, and of the\r\n    business done in the councils. No one would propose to prescribe\r\n    an educational qualification for the vote; but no one can deny the\r\n    practical difficulties which make a very general extension of the\r\n    franchise impossible, until literacy is far more widely spread\r\n    than is the case at present. Progress was temporarily interrupted\r\n    by uncertainty as to the distribution of financial resources which\r\n    would result from the constitutional changes; but the imminence of\r\n    these has given a new importance to the question and its\r\n    consideration has been resumed. We trust that impetus will thus be\r\n    given to a widespread movement which will be taken up and carried\r\n    forward boldly by the reformed councils.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject has been so fairly dealt with, the defects of the present\r\nsystem so frankly recognised and the need of wider dissemination of\r\neducation so forcibly explained that we need add nothing.\r\n\r\nIn our judgment the circumstances and conditions under which it is\r\nproposed to transfer the direction of Indian education to Indian hands\r\nare extremely unfair. It is admitted that under the present economic\r\nconditions of the Indian people, there is little scope for further\r\ntaxation. If so, there are only two ways to find money for education,\r\n(_a_) by economy in the other departments of public administration,\r\n(_b_) by loans.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation made by the Secretary of State and the Viceroy for an\r\nincrease in the emoluments of the European services hardly leaves any\r\nroom for (_a_). We have discussed the matter at some length in another\r\nchapter. The only other source left, then, is by incurring debt.\r\nEducation is so important and so fundamental to the future progress of\r\nthe country that in our judgment the ministers should feel no hesitation\r\nin having recourse to it, but the problem is so gigantic that, lacking\r\nmaterial reduction in the cost of administration in other departments,\r\nit will be extremely difficult to meet the situation without an\r\nunreasonable increase in the public debt. Anyway, under the scheme\r\nrecommended, the Government cannot divest itself of the fullest\r\nresponsibility in the matter. The scheme gives no vital power to the\r\nelectorates or their representatives. The authority of the Executive in\r\nthe matter of appropriations remains unaffected and so long as it\r\nretains the final say in the making of the Budget, the Indian ministers\r\ncannot, handicapped by so many restrictions, be held responsible if the\r\nprogress is slow.\r\n\r\nOur views on the problem of education in India have been expressed in a\r\nseparate book to which interested readers are referred.[2] We hold that\r\nit is the duty of the Government to provide free and wholesome education\r\nto every child at public cost, that education should be compulsory up to\r\nthe age of 18. The policy of the English Education Act of 1918 ought to\r\nbe applied to India, and if it cannot be done from current funds, loans\r\nshould be raised for the purpose. It is a matter which brooks of no\r\ndelay. The whole future of India depends upon it. Nay, the future of\r\nhumanity as a whole is affected by it. The world cannot be safe for any\r\nkind of democracy, nor can the world make progress towards a better\r\norder without the active coöperation of three hundred and fifteen\r\nmillion Indians forming one-fifth of the human race. Not only is the\r\nworld poorer by reason of India's inability to coöperate in the work of\r\nprogress but its present educational backwardness is a serious handicap\r\nto the rest of humanity going forward.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] We do not accept this statement. The Government controls the policy\r\nof the universities to such an extent as virtually to make them official\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n[2] National Education in India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have so far discussed the Report and such remarks as we have made\r\nhave been by way of comment. In this chapter we propose to give in brief\r\noutline our own view of the problem.\r\n\r\nLet us first be clear about the exact nature of the Indian problem.\r\nPolitical institutions are, after all, only a reflection of the national\r\nmind and of national conditions. What is the end? The end is freedom to\r\nlive and to live according to our own conception of what life should be,\r\nto pursue our own ideals, to develop our own civilization and to secure\r\nthat unity of purpose which would distinguish us from the other nations\r\nof the world, insuring for us a position of independence and honor, of\r\nsecurity from within and non-interference from without. We have no\r\nambition to conquer and rule other peoples; we have no desire to exploit\r\nforeign markets; not even to impose our \"kultur\" and our \"civilization\"\r\non others. At present we are counted among the backward peoples of the\r\nearth mainly because we are a subject people, governed by a foreign\r\npower, protected by foreign bayonets and schooled by foreign teachers.\r\nThe condition of our masses is intellectually deplorable and\r\neconomically miserable; our women are still in bondage and do not enjoy\r\nthat freedom which their Western sisters have won; our domestic\r\nmasters, the prince and priest, are still in saddle; caste and privilege\r\nstill hold some sway, yet it is not true that, taken all in all, we are\r\nreally a backward people. Even in these matters we find that the\r\ndifference between us and the \"advanced\" nations of the world is one of\r\ndegree only. Caste and privilege rule in the United States as much as in\r\nIndia. There is nothing in our history which can be put on the same\r\nlevel as the lynching of Mr. Little, the deportation of Bisbee miners,\r\nthe lynching of the Negroes, and other incidents of a similar nature\r\nindicative of race hatred and deep rooted colour prejudice. No nation in\r\nthe world can claim an _ideal state of society_, in which everything is\r\nof the best. On the other hand, there are certain matters in which\r\ncomparison is to our advantage. Even with the advance of drunkenness\r\nunder British rule we are yet a sober nation; our _standards_ of\r\npersonal and domestic hygiene are much higher than those of the Western\r\npeople; our standards of life much simpler and nobler; our social ideals\r\nmore humane; and our spiritual aspirations infinitely superior. As a\r\nnation we do not believe in war or militarism or evangelism. We do not\r\nforce our views on others; we have greater toleration for other people's\r\nopinions and beliefs than has any other nation in the world; we have not\r\nyet acquired that craze for possessions and for sheer luxurious and\r\nriotous life which marks the modern Pharisee of the West. Our people,\r\naccording to their conceptions, means and opportunities are kindly,\r\nhospitable, gentle, law-abiding, mutually helpful, full of respect for\r\nothers, and peace loving. It is, in fact, the abnormal extent in which\r\nthese qualities exist that has contributed to our political and\r\neconomic exploitation by others. In India capitalism and landlordism\r\nhave not yet developed as fully as they have among the civilized nations\r\nof the West. The West is in revolt against capitalism and landlordism.\r\nWe do not claim that before the advent of the British there was no\r\ncapitalism or landlordism in India. But we do contend that, though there\r\nwas a certain amount of rivalry and competition between the different\r\ncastes, within the castes there was much more coöperation and\r\nfellow-feeling than there has ever been in the West. Our native\r\ngovernments and their underlings, the landlords, did exact a high price\r\nfrom the village communities for the privilege of cultivating their\r\nlands but within the village there was no _inter se_ competition either\r\nbetween the tillers of the soil or between the pursuers of crafts. The\r\ngulf between the rich and the poor was not so marked as it is to-day in\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\nUnder the British rule and since its introduction, however, things have\r\nchanged considerably. Without adopting the best features of modern life,\r\nwe have been forced by circumstances, political and economic, to give up\r\nthe best of our own. Village communities have been destroyed; joint and\r\ncorporate bargaining has given place to individual transactions; every\r\nbit of land has been separately measured, marked and taxed; common lands\r\nhave been divided; the price of land and rent has risen abnormally. The\r\nmoney-lender who, before the advent of British rule, held an extremely\r\nsubordinate position in the village community, has suddenly come to\r\noccupy the first place. He owns the best lands and the best houses and\r\nholds the bodies and souls of the agriculturalists in mortgage. The\r\nvillages which were generally homogeneous in population, bound to each\r\nother by ties of race, blood and religion, have become heterogeneous,\r\nwith nondescript people of all races and all religions who have acquired\r\nland by purchase. Competition has taken the place of coöperation. A\r\ncountry where social coöperation and social solidarity reigned at least\r\nwithin castes, within villages and within urban areas has been entirely\r\ndisrupted and disintegrated by unlimited and uncontrolled competition.\r\nIndia never knew any poor laws; she never needed any; nor orphan\r\nasylums, nor old age pensions and widow homes. She had no use for\r\norganized charity. Rarely did any man die for want of food or clothing,\r\nexcept in famines. Hospitality was open and was dispensed under a sense\r\nof duty and obligation and not by way of charity or kindness. The\r\nsurvival of the fittest had no hold on our minds. We had no factories or\r\nworkshops. People worked in their _own_ homes or shops either with their\r\nown money or with money borrowed from the money-lender. The artisans\r\nwere the masters of the goods they produced and, unless otherwise agreed\r\nwith the money-lender, sold them in the open market. The necessities of\r\nlife, being cheap and easily procurable the artisans cared more for\r\nquality than quantity. Their work was a source of pleasure and pride as\r\nwell as of profit to them. Now everything has gone, pleasure, pride, as\r\nwell as profit. Where profit has remained, pleasure and pride are gone.\r\nWe are on the high road to a \"distinctly industrial civilization.\" In\r\nfact, the principal complaint of our political reformers and free trade\r\neconomists is that the British Government has not let us proceed on\r\nthat road at a sufficiently rapid pace and that, in preventing us, they\r\nhave been dominated by their own national interests more than by our own\r\ngood. We saw that other nations were progressing by following the laws\r\nof industrial development, and quite naturally we also wanted to prosper\r\nby the same method. This war has opened our eyes as it has opened those\r\nof the rest of the world and we have begun to feel that the goal that we\r\nsought leads to perdition and not salvation. This makes it necessary for\r\nthe Indian politicians and economists to review their ideas of political\r\nprogress. What are we aiming at? Do we want to rise, in order to fall?\r\nDo we want to copy and emulate Europe even in its mistakes and blunders?\r\nDoes the road to heaven lie through hell? Must we make a wreck of our\r\nship and then try salvage? The civilization of Europe, as we have known\r\nit, is dying. It may take decades or perhaps a century or more to die.\r\nBut _die it must_. This War has prepared a death bed for it from which\r\nit will never rise. Upon its ruins is rising, or will rise, another\r\ncivilization which will reproduce much of what was valuable and precious\r\nin our own with much of what we never had. The question that we want to\r\nput to our compatriots is, shall we prepare ourselves for the coming\r\nera, or shall we bury ourselves in the débris of the expiring one. We\r\nhave no right to answer it for others, but our answer is clear and\r\nunequivocal. We will not be a party to any scheme which shall add to the\r\npowers of the capitalist and the landlord and will introduce and\r\naccentuate the evils of the expiring industrial civilization into our\r\nbeloved country.\r\n\r\nWe are not unaware that, according to the judgment of some thinkers,\r\namongst them Karl Marx, a country must pass through the capitalistic\r\nmill, before the proletariat comes to its own. We do not believe in the\r\ntruth of this theory, but even if it be true we will not consciously\r\nhelp in proving it to be true. The existing social order of Europe is\r\nvicious and immoral. It is worm eaten. It has the germs of plague,\r\ndisease, death and destitution in it. It is in a state of decomposition.\r\nIt is based on injustice, tyranny, oppression and class rule. Certain\r\nphases of it are inherent in our own system. Certain others we are\r\nborrowing from our masters in order to make a complete mess. Wisdom and\r\nforesight require that we be forewarned. What we want and what we need\r\nis not the power to implant in full force and in full vigour the\r\n_expiring_ European system, but power to keep out its development on\r\nvicious lines, with opportunities of gradually and slowly undoing the\r\nevil that has already been done.\r\n\r\nThe Government of India as at present constituted is a Government of\r\ncapitalists and landlords, of both England and India. Under the proposed\r\nscheme the power of the former will be reduced and that of the latter\r\nincreased. The Indo-British Association does not like it, not because it\r\nloves the masses of India for which it hypocritically and insincerely\r\nprofesses solicitude, but because in their judgment it reduces the\r\nprofits of the British governing classes. We doubt if the scheme really\r\ndoes affect even that. But if it does, it is good so far.\r\n\r\nThe ugly feature of the scheme is not its potentiality in transferring\r\nthe power into the hands of the Brahmins (the power of the Brahmin as\r\nsuch, is gone for good), but in the possibility of its giving too much\r\npower to the \"profiteering\" class, be they the landlords of Bengal and\r\nOudh, or the millionaires of Bombay. The scheme protects the European\r\nmerchants; it confers special privileges on the small European\r\nCommunity; it provides special representation for the landlords, the\r\nChambers of Commerce, the Mohammedans and the Sikhs. What is left for\r\nthe general tax-paying public is precious little. The authors of the\r\nscheme say that to withhold complete and immediate Home Rule is in the\r\ninterest of the general masses, the poor inarticulate ryot and the\r\nworkingman. We wish we could believe in it. We wish it were true.\r\nPerhaps they mean it, but our past experience does not justify our\r\naccepting it at its face value.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one thing we can do. We can ask them for proofs by\r\ninsisting on and agitating for the immediate legislative relief of the\r\nryot and the middle classes. We should adopt the aims of the British\r\nLabour Party as our own, start educating our people on those lines and\r\nformulate measures which will secure for them _real freedom_ and not the\r\ncounterfeit coin which passes for it. It will require years of education\r\nand agitation but it has to be done, no matter whether we are ruled by\r\nthe British or by our own property holders. We are not opposed to Home\r\nRule. Nay, we press for it. In our judgment the objections urged against\r\ngiving it at once are flimsy and intangible. The chief obstacles are\r\nsuch as have been created or perpetuated by the British themselves. The\r\ncaste does not prevent us from having _at least_ as much home rule as is\r\nenjoyed by the people of Italy, Hungary, the Balkan States and some of\r\nthe South American Republics. But if we cannot have it at once and if\r\nthe British must retain the power of final decision in their hands, we\r\nmust insist upon something being immediately done not only to educate\r\nthe ryot but to give him economic relief. So long as the British\r\ncontinue to refuse to do that we must hold them responsible for all the\r\nmisery that Indian humanity is suffering from.\r\n\r\nWe want political power in order to raise the intellectual and political\r\nstatus of our masses. We do not want to bolster up classes. Our goal is\r\nreal liberty, equality and opportunity for all. We want to avoid, if\r\npossible, the evils of the class struggle. We will pass through the mill\r\nif we must, but we should like to try to avoid it. For that reason we\r\nwant freedom to legislate and freedom to determine our fiscal\r\narrangements. That is our main purpose in our demand for Home Rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNATIONAL ASPECT\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far we have discussed the Indian question from the internal or\r\nnational point of view. But it has an international aspect also. It is\r\nsaid, and we hope that it is true, that the world is entering into an\r\nera of new internationalism and that the old exclusive chauvinistic\r\nnationalism is in its last gasps. This war was the greatest social\r\nmix-up known to history. It has brought about the downfall of many\r\nmonarchs and the destruction of four empires. The armies of the\r\nbelligerents on both sides contained the greatest assortment of races\r\nand nations, of religions and languages that were ever brought together\r\nfor mutual destruction. Primarily a fight between the European\r\nChristians, it drew into its arena Hindus, Mohammedans, Buddhists,\r\nShintos, Jews and Negroes of Africa and America.\r\n\r\nThe war has produced a revolution in Russia, the like of which has never\r\nbeen known. It is now said openly that the Russian Revolution had as\r\nmuch influence on the final _debacle_ of the Central Powers as the\r\nstrength of the Allies and the resources of America. The revolution has\r\nspread to Germany and Austria and threatens to engulf the whole of\r\nEurope. It has given birth to a new order of society, aglow with the\r\nspirit of a new and elevated kind of internationalism. This\r\ninternationalism must have for its foundation justice and\r\nself-determination for all peoples, regardless of race or religion,\r\ncreed or color. In the new understanding between nations coöperation\r\nmust be substituted for competition and mutual trust and helpfulness for\r\ndistrust and exploitation of the weaker by the stronger. The only\r\nalternatives are reaction, with the certainty of even greater war in the\r\nnear future, and Bolshevism.\r\n\r\nNow, nobody knows what Bolshevism represents. The Socialists themselves\r\nare divided over it. The advanced wing is enthusiastic, the moderates\r\nare denouncing it. The Liberals and Radicals are freely recognizing that\r\nit has brought into the affairs of men a new spirit which is going to\r\nstay and substantially influence the future of the world. The\r\nstand-patters denounce it in the strongest possible terms. They\r\ncalumniate it to their heart's content and move heaven and earth to\r\nexterminate it. But we feel that only radical changes in the existing\r\norder will stem its tide. The Socialists and Radicals want to make the\r\nmost of it, while the Imperialist Liberals and Conservatives want to\r\ngive as little as is compatible with the safety of the existing order in\r\nwhich they are supreme. The struggle will take some time, but that it\r\nwill end in favor of the new spirit no one doubts.\r\n\r\nThe only way to meet Bolshevism is to concede rights to the different\r\npeoples of the earth now being bled and exploited. Otherwise the\r\ndiscontented and exploited countries of the world will be the best\r\nbreeding centres for it. India must come into her own soon, else not\r\neven the Himalayas can effectually bar the entry of Bolshevism into\r\nIndia. A contented, self-governing India may be proof against it; a\r\ndiscontented, dissatisfied, oppressed India perhaps the most fertile\r\nfield. We hope the British statesmen are alive to the situation.\r\n\r\nBut that is not the only way to look at the international importance of\r\nIndia. By its geographical situation it is the connecting link between\r\nthe Near East and the Far East and the clearing house for the trade of\r\nthe world. Racially, it holds the balance between the European Aryan and\r\nthe yellow races. In any military conflict between the white and the\r\nyellow races, the people of India will be a decisive factor. In a\r\nconflict of peace they will be a harmonising element. Racially they are\r\nthe kin of the European. By religion and culture they are nearer the\r\nChinese and Japanese.\r\n\r\nWith 70 million Moslems India is the most important centre of Mohammedan\r\nsentiment. With Christians as their present rulers, the Hindus and\r\nMohammedans of India are coming to realise that their best interests\r\nrequire a closing up of their ranks. There is no doubt that, come what\r\nmay, their relations in future will be much more cordial, friendly and\r\nmutually sympathetic than they have been in the past. The Hindus will\r\nstand by their Mohammedan countrymen in all their efforts to revive the\r\nglory of Islam, and to regain political independence for it. There is no\r\nfear of a Pan-Islamic movement if the new spirit of internationalism\r\nprevails. If, however, it does not, the Pan-Islamic movement might find\r\na sympathetic soul in India. Islam is not dead. It cannot and will not\r\ndie. The only way to make it a force for harmony and peace is to\r\nrecognise its potentialities and to respect its susceptibilities. The\r\npolitical independence of Islamic countries is the basic foundation for\r\nsuch a state. We hope that the statesmen of the world will give their\r\nmost earnest thought to the question and sincerely put into practice the\r\nprinciples they have been enunciating during the war. The case of India\r\nwill be an acid test.\r\n\r\nA happy India will make a valuable contribution to the evolution of a\r\nbetter and more improved humanity. An unhappy India will clog the wheels\r\nof progress. It will not be easy for the masters of India to rule it on\r\nold lines. If not reconciled it might prove the pivot of the next war. A\r\nhappy India will be one of the brightest spots in the British\r\nCommonwealth. A discontented India will be a cause of standing shame and\r\na source of never ending trouble.\r\n\r\nWith a republican China in the northeast, a constitutional Persia in the\r\nnorthwest and a Bolshevist Russia in the not remote north, it will be\r\nextremely foolish to attempt to rule India despotically. Not even the\r\ngods can do it. It is not possible even if the legislature devotes all\r\nits sittings to the drafting and passing of one hundred coercion acts.\r\nThe peace of the world, international harmony and good-will, the good\r\nname of the British Commonwealth, the safety of the Empire as such,\r\ndemand the peaceful introduction and development of democracy in India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\n\r\nA SYNOPSIS OF THE INDIAN INDUSTRIAL COMMISSIONERS' REPORT\r\n\r\n\r\nA bureaucracy has the fatal tendency of perpetuating itself and of\r\nmaking itself indispensable. As a result, we find that the prospects and\r\npowers of the bureaucracy become more important than even the purposes\r\nfor which it exists. It is a commonplace of politics that a state exists\r\nfor the people comprising it, and that the servants of the state are the\r\nservants of the people. They are the tools which the body politic uses\r\nfor its corporate life. Even in self-governed countries the tendency of\r\nglorifying the state and the servants of the state at the cost of the\r\npeople is not uncommon, though the fact is not, or rarely, if at all,\r\nadmitted in so many words. In dependencies and countries governed by a\r\nforeign bureaucracy, however, this fact is undisguisedly kept before the\r\npeople and they are openly and frankly told that the powers and\r\nprospects of the servants of the government are of greater consequence\r\nand importance than the wishes and welfare of the people. This is amply\r\nillustrated by the extravagant scale on which the government of India\r\npays its European servants and goes on adding to their privileges under\r\nall sorts of pretences and excuses. People may live or they may die for\r\nwant of food, for lack of knowledge of the ordinary laws of hygiene, for\r\nlack of employment, but the bureaucrats must enjoy their princely\r\nsalaries, their hill allowances, their furlough, and travelling and\r\nleave perquisites, promotions and pensions. If the cost of living\r\nincreases, they must get a raise in their salaries, no matter how the\r\nincreased cost of living affects the general body of the people.\r\nBesides, they must have their pensions, as their children are infinitely\r\nmore important than those of the tax-payer.\r\n\r\nWe have already reproduced and discussed the recommendations of the\r\nSecretary of State for India and the Viceroy, about the European members\r\nof the Indian services. The Viceroy has only recently emphasized the\r\nimportance of a substantial increase in their salaries, although there\r\nis a deficit of 20 million dollars in the budget estimates for the next\r\nyear. That is an old story, however. What we are immediately concerned\r\nwith are the recommendations of the Indian Industrial Commission, in\r\nfavor of creating a new branch of public service divided into the\r\ninevitable Imperial and Provincial branches, for furthering the\r\nindustrial development of the country. Our meaning will be clear as we\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Industrial Commission was appointed by the Government of\r\nIndia \"to examine and report upon the possibilities of further\r\nindustrial development in India and to submit its recommendations with\r\nspecial references to the following questions:--\r\n\r\n  (_a_) whether new openings for the profitable employment of Indian\r\n  capital in commerce can be indicated.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) whether, and if so, in what manner, government can usefully\r\n  give direct encouragement to industrial development,\r\n\r\n    1. by rendering technical advice more freely available;\r\n\r\n    2. by the demonstration of the possibility, on a commercial scale,\r\n    of particular industries;\r\n\r\n    3. by affording, directly, or indirectly, financial assistance to\r\n    industrial enterprise; or\r\n\r\n    4. by any other means which are not incompatible with the existing\r\n    fiscal policy of the government of India.\"\r\n\r\nThe tariff question was excluded from the scope of the Commission's\r\ninquiries, though it was expressed that the \"building up of industries\r\nwhere the capital, control and management should be in the hands of the\r\nIndians\" was the \"special object\" which the government had in view. The\r\nGovernment spokesman in the meeting of the Legislative Council at which\r\nthe appointment of the Commission was announced further emphasized \"that\r\nit was of immense importance, alike to India herself and to the Empire\r\nas a whole, that Indians should take a larger share in the industrial\r\ndevelopment of their country.\" He \"deprecated the taking of any steps,\r\nif it might merely mean that the manufacturer who now competes with you\r\nfrom a distance would transfer his activities to India and compete with\r\nyou within your boundaries.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission has now submitted its report which has been published as\r\na Parliamentary blue book in a bulky volume of about 500 pages including\r\na separate lengthy note by one of the leading Indian members of the\r\nCommission. The note is, in our judgment, very valuable, as it gives the\r\nIndian point of view of the industrial problem in such a lucid and\r\nexhaustive way as to leave no room for doubt as to what articulate India\r\nthinks in the matter. The note does not express only the personal\r\nopinion of the author but the considered views of the Indian Nationalist\r\nParty.\r\n\r\nBoth the report and the note have been the source of much personal\r\ngratification to us as they corroborate and confirm to an extraordinary\r\nextent what the author said in his book \"England's Debt to India,\"\r\nthough the report is by no means free from fallacies and one-sided\r\nstatements of fact and opinions.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIn the words of the summary prefixed to the report:\r\n\r\n\"The first chapters of the report deal with India as an industrial\r\ncountry, her present position, and her potentialities. They show how\r\nlittle the march of modern industry has affected the great bulk of the\r\nIndian population, which remains engrossed in agriculture, winning a\r\nbare subsistence from the soil by antiquated methods of cultivation.\r\nSuch changes as have been wrought in rural areas are the effects of\r\neconomic rather than of industrial evolution. In certain centers the\r\nprogress of Western industrial methods is discernible; and a number of\r\nthese are described in order to present a picture of the conditions\r\nunder which industries are carried on, attention being drawn to the\r\nshortage and to the general inefficiency of Indian labor and to the lack\r\nof an indigenous supervising agency. Proposals are made for the better\r\nexploitation of the forests and fisheries. In discussing the industrial\r\ndeficiencies of India, the report shows how unequal the industrial\r\ndevelopment of our industries has been. Money has been invested in\r\ncommerce rather than industries, and only those industries have been\r\ntaken up which appeared to offer safe and easy profits. Previous to the\r\nwar, too ready reliance was placed on imports from overseas, and this\r\nhabit was fostered by the Government practice of purchasing stores in\r\nEngland. India produces nearly all the raw materials necessary for the\r\nrequirements of a modern community; but is unable to manufacture many of\r\nthe articles and materials necessary alike in times of peace and war.\r\nFor instance, her great textile industries are dependent upon supplies\r\nof imported machinery and would have to shut down if command of the seas\r\nwere lost. It is vital, therefore, for the Government to ensure the\r\nestablishment of those industries in India whose absence exposes us to\r\ngrave danger in event of war. The report advocates the introduction of\r\nmodern methods of agriculture and in particular of labor-saving devices.\r\nGreater efficiency in cultivation, and in the preparation of produce for\r\nthe market would follow; labor now wastefully employed would be set free\r\nfor industries and the establishment of shops for the manufacture and\r\nrepair of machinery would lead to the growth of a huge engineering\r\nindustry.\"\r\n\r\nThe summarized statements will be made more clear by the following\r\nextracts from Chapter I on rural India.\r\n\r\n\"Famine connotes not so much a scarcity or entire absence of food as\r\nhigh prices and a lack of employment in the affected areas.... The\r\ncapital in the hands of the country traders has proved insufficient to\r\nfinance the ordinary movements of crops and the seasonal calls for\r\naccommodations from the main financial centers are constantly\r\nincreasing. This lack of available capital is one cause of the high\r\nrates that the ryot has to pay for the ready money which he needs to buy\r\nseed and to meet the expenses of cultivation. On the other hand, money\r\nis largely invested in the purchase of landed property, the price of\r\nwhich has risen to very high figures in many parts of the country....\r\nBut the no less urgent necessity of relieving the ryot from the enormous\r\nload of debt with which he has been burdened by the dearness of\r\nagricultural capital, the necessity of meeting periodic demands for rent\r\nand his social habits, has hitherto been met only to a very small extent\r\nby co-operative organization. The farmer, owing partly to poverty and\r\npartly to the extreme sub-division of the land, is very often a producer\r\non so small a scale that it is practically impossible for him to take\r\nhis crops to the larger markets where he can sell at current rates to\r\nthe agents of the bigger firms.... A better market system, co-operative\r\nselling, and education are the promising remedies.\"\r\n\r\nComing to the industrial centers of the country apart from the rural\r\nareas, the report says:\r\n\r\n\"A characteristic feature of organised industry and commerce in all the\r\nchief Indian centers is the presence of large agency firms which, except\r\nin the case of Bombay, are mainly European. In addition to participating\r\nin the export and import trade, they finance and manage industrial\r\nventures all over the country, and often have several branches in the\r\nlarge towns. The importance of these agency houses may be gauged by the\r\nfact that they are in control of the majority of the cotton, jute and\r\nother mills as well as of the tea gardens and the coal mines.\"\r\n\r\nThe general remarks about the industrial deficiency of the country will\r\nbe better understood from the following extracts:\r\n\r\n\"We have already referred to the dependence of India on outside sources\r\nof sulphur and the necessity for insisting on the local smelting of her\r\nsulphide ores. In the absence of any means for producing from purely\r\nIndian sources sulphuric, nitric, and hydrochloric acids, and alkalis,\r\nour manufactures, actual or prospective, of paper, drugs, matches, oils,\r\nexplosives, disinfectants, dyes and textiles are dependent upon imports\r\nwhich under war conditions, might be cut off. Sources of raw materials\r\nfor heavy chemicals are deficient. The output of saltpeter could be\r\nraised to 40,000 tons per annum and supplementary supplies of nitrates\r\ncould be produced, if necessary, from atmospheric nitrogen; but for this\r\nagain, cheap electric power is needed. Salt occurs in abundance and the\r\nestablishment of caustic soda manufacture, preferably by an electric\r\nprocess, that would also yield chlorine, is a necessary part of our\r\nchemical programme. There are available in the country, in fair\r\nquantity, many other raw materials necessary for heavy chemical\r\nmanufacture, in addition to those referred to under other heads; among\r\nthem may be mentioned alum, salts, barytes, borax, gypsum, limestone,\r\nmagnesia, phosphates of lime and ochres. The installation of plants for\r\nthe recovery of by-products in coking has recently been undertaken, but\r\nfor the recovery of tar and ammonia only. The recovery of benzol and\r\nrelated products has so far not been attempted nor has anything been\r\ndone to utilise the tar by re-distillation or other chemical treatment.\r\n\r\n\"Although India exported raw rubber valued in 1917-1918 at 162 lakhs,\r\nrubber manufacture has not been started in the country and goods to the\r\nvalue of 116 lakhs were imported in 1917-1918. This industry is one of\r\nthose that are essential in the national interest and should be\r\ninaugurated, if necessary, by special measures.\r\n\r\n\"Though textile industries exist on a large scale, the range of goods\r\nproduced is still narrow, and we are dependent upon foreign sources for\r\nnearly all of our miscellaneous textile requirements. In addition to\r\nthese, the ordinary demands of Indian consumers necessitate the import\r\nof some Rs. 66 crores worth of cotton piece-goods, and interference with\r\nthis source of supply has caused serious hardship. Flax is not yet grown\r\nin appreciable quantities and the indigenous species of so-called hemp,\r\nthough abundantly grown, are not at present used in any organized Indian\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\"Our ability to produce and to preserve many of our foodstuffs in\r\ntransportable forms or to provide receptacles for mineral or vegetable\r\noils depends upon the supply of tin plates which India at present\r\nimports in the absence of local manufactures.\r\n\r\n\"Our few paper factories before the war stood on an uncertain basis and\r\nwe are still dependent upon foreign manufacture for most of the higher\r\nqualities.\"\r\n\r\nIndia produces enormous quantities of leather on a relatively small\r\nscale by modern processes; and the village tanner supplies the local\r\nneeds only, and with a very inferior material. To obtain the quantities\r\nand standards of finished leather which the country requires, it will be\r\nnecessary to stimulate industries by the institution of technical\r\ntraining and by the experimental work on a considerable scale.\r\n\r\n\"Large quantities of vegetable products are exported for the manufacture\r\nof drugs, dyes and essential oils, which in many cases are re-imported\r\ninto India.\r\n\r\n\"The blanks in our industrial catalog are of a kind most surprising to\r\none familiar only with the European conditions. We have already alluded\r\ngenerally to the basic deficiencies in our iron and steel industries\r\nand have explained how, as a result, the many engineering shops in India\r\nare mainly devoted to the repair or to the manufacture of, hitherto\r\nmainly from imported materials, comparatively simple structures, such as\r\nroofs, bridges, wagons and tanks. India can build a small marine engine\r\nand turn out a locomotive provided certain essential parts are obtained\r\nfrom abroad but _she has not a machine to make nails or screws, nor can\r\nshe manufacture some of the essential parts of electrical machinery_.[1]\r\n\r\n\"Electrical plant and equipment are still, therefore, imported, in spite\r\nof the fact that incandescent lamps are used by the millions and\r\nelectric fans by the tens of thousands. India relies on foreign supplies\r\nof steel springs and iron chains and for wire ropes, a vital necessity\r\nof her mining industry. We have already pointed out the absence of any\r\nmanufacture of textile mill accessories. The same may be said of the\r\nequipment of nearly all industrial concerns. The list of deficiencies\r\nincludes all kinds of machine tools, steam engines, boilers and gas and\r\noil engines, hydraulic presses and heavy cranes. Simple lathes, small\r\nsugar mills, small pumps, and a variety of odds and ends are made in\r\nsome shops, but the basis of their manufacture and the limited scale of\r\nproduction do not enable them to compete with imported goods of similar\r\ncharacter to the extent of excluding the latter. Agriculturists' and\r\nplanters' tools such as ploughs, _mamooties_, spades, shovels and\r\npickaxes are mainly imported as well as the hand tools of improved\r\ncharacter used in most cottage industries, including wood-working tools,\r\nhealds and reeds, shuttles and pickers. Bicycles, motor cycles and motor\r\ncars cannot at present be made in India though the imports under these\r\nheads were valued at Rs. 187 lakhs in 1913-1914. The manufacture of\r\ncommon glass is carried on in various localities, and some works have\r\nturned out ordinary domestic utensils and bottles of fair quality, but\r\nno attempt has been made to produce plate or sheet glass or indeed any\r\nof the harder kinds of commercial glass, while optical glass manufacture\r\nhas never even been mooted. The extent of our dependence on imported\r\nglass is evidenced by the fact that in 1913-1914 this was valued at Rs.\r\n164 lakhs. Porcelain insulators, good enough for low tension currents,\r\nare manufactured, but India does not produce the higher qualities of\r\neither porcelain or china....\r\n\r\n\"The list of industries which, though their products are essential alike\r\nin peace and war, are lacking in this country, _is lengthy and almost\r\nominous_.[2] Until they are brought into existence on an adequate scale,\r\nIndian capitalists will, in times of peace, be deprived of a number of\r\nprofitable enterprises; whilst in the event of war which renders the sea\r\ntransport impossible, India's all-important existing industries will be\r\nexposed to the risk of stoppage, her consumers to great hardship, and\r\nher armed forces to the gravest danger.\"\r\n\r\nIn discussing the part played by Indians of all classes in the\r\nindustrial development of the Country the Commission observes:\r\n\r\n\"It is obvious that the great obstacles are the lack of even vernacular\r\neducation and the low standard of comfort. The higher grade of worker,\r\nthe mechanical artisan, in the absence of adequate education has been\r\nprevented from attaining a greater degree of skill. He finds himself\r\nwhere he is, less by deliberate choice than by the accident of his\r\nobtaining work at some railway or other engineering shop, or by the\r\npossession of a somewhat more enterprising spirit than his fellows.\r\nThere is at present only very inadequate provision for any form of\r\ntechnical training to supplement the experience that he can gain by\r\nactual work in an engineering shop, while the generally admitted need\r\nfor a more trustworthy and skillful type of man is at present met by\r\nimporting charge-men and foremen from abroad.\"\r\n\r\nIn short, the industrial deficiencies of India are directly due to\r\n\r\n    (_a_) lack of education, general, scientific, and technical.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) lack of encouragement by the Government which has so far\r\n    deliberately purchased most kinds of stores needed for government\r\n    requirements from England.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural deficiencies are due to the same causes plus the\r\npoverty of the ryot and his inability to secure the capital necessary\r\nfor improvements on reasonable terms of interest. Yet, in spite of this\r\nwe find the Commission laying unwarranted emphasis upon the creation of\r\nnew posts divided into Imperial and Provincial branches for Industrial,\r\nAgricultural, and scientific experts. One should have thought that the\r\nfirst recommendation should be the immediate inauguration of general\r\neducation throughout the country with adequate provision for technical,\r\nscientific, agricultural and commercial instruction.\r\n\r\nThe industrial development of the country needs these things: (1)\r\ngeneral education, (2) cheap capital, (3) skilled labor, (4) protection\r\nagainst improper foreign competition. Expert advice and research are\r\nneeded very much, but no amount of research or expert advice will\r\nadvance the cause of industries unless the level of general intelligence\r\nhas been raised and some provision made for cheap capital and skilled\r\nlabor. Says the Honorable Malaviya in his separate note:\r\n\r\n\"If the industries of India are to develop, and Indians to have a fair\r\nchance in the competition to which they are exposed, it is essential\r\nthat a system of education at least as good as that of Japan should be\r\nintroduced in India. I am at one with my colleagues in urging the\r\nfundamental necessity of providing primary education for the artisan and\r\nlaboring population. No system of industrial and technical education can\r\nbe reared except on that basis. But the artisan and laboring population\r\ndo not stand apart from the rest of the community; and therefore if\r\nthis _sine qua non_ of industrial efficiency and economic progress is to\r\nbe established it is necessary that primary education should be made\r\nuniversal. I agree also in urging that drawing and manual training\r\nshould be introduced into primary schools as soon as possible. In my\r\nopinion, until primary education is made universal, if not compulsory,\r\nand until drawing is made a compulsory subject in all primary schools,\r\nthe foundation of a satisfactory system of industrial and technical\r\neducation will be wanting. Of course this will require time. But I think\r\nthat that is exactly why an earnest endeavor should be made in this\r\ndirection without any further avoidable delay.\"\r\n\r\nIn support of his opinion he quotes the following pertinent observation\r\nof Mr. Samuelson:\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion, I have to state my deep conviction that the people of\r\nIndia expect and demand of their government the design, organization and\r\nexecution of systematic technical education and there is urgent need for\r\nit to bestir itself, for other nations have already sixty years' start\r\nof us, and have produced several generations of educated workmen. Even\r\nif we begin to-morrow the technical education of all the youths of\r\ntwelve years of age, who have received sound elementary education, it\r\nwill take seven years before these young men can commence the practical\r\nbusiness of life and then they will form but an insignificant minority\r\nin an uneducated mass. It will take fifteen years before those children\r\nwho have not yet begun to receive an elementary education shall have\r\npassed from the age of 7 to 21 and represent a completely trained\r\ngeneration; and even then they will find less than half of their\r\ncomrades educated. In the race of nations, therefore, we shall find it\r\nhard to overtake the sixty years that we have lost. To-morrow, then let\r\nus undertake with all our energy our neglected task; the urgency is\r\ntwofold--a small proportion of our youth has received elementary\r\neducation, but no technical education: for that portion let us at once\r\norganize technical schools in every small town, technical colleges in\r\nevery large town and a technical university in the metropolis. The rest\r\nof the rising generation has received no education at all, and for them\r\nlet us at once organize elementary education, even if compulsory.\"\r\n\r\nTo provide for a new department of experts on a lavish scale before\r\nmaking an adequate provision for general education is putting the cart\r\nbefore the horse. This has been pointed out in a very able article by\r\none of our premier scientists (who has taken a leading part in the\r\ndevelopment of Indian industries) published in the _Modern Review_,\r\nCalcutta, for March, 1919.\r\n\r\nSays Sir P. C. Roy:\r\n\r\n\"We always begin at the wrong end. I should be the last person to\r\ndisparage the necessity for scientific research. The simple fact is,\r\nhowever, overlooked that our agricultural population, steeped in\r\nignorance and illiteracy and owning only small plots and scattered\r\nholdings, are not in a position to take advantage of or utilize the\r\nelaborate scientific researches which lie entombed in the bulletins and\r\ntransactions of these Institutes. Mr. Mackenna very rightly observes:\r\nThe Famine Commissioners, so long ago as 1880, expressed the view that\r\nno general advance in the agricultural system can be expected until the\r\nrural population had been so educated as to enable them to take a\r\npractical interest in agricultural progress and reform. These views were\r\nconfirmed by the Agricultural Conference of 1888. The most important and\r\nprobably the soundest proposition laid down by the Conference was that\r\nit was most desirable to extend primary education amongst agricultural\r\nclasses. Such small countries as Denmark, Holland and Belgium are in a\r\nposition to send immense supplies of cheese, butter, eggs, etc., to\r\nEngland, because the farmers there are highly advanced in general\r\nenlightenment and technical education and are thus in a position to\r\nprofit by the researches of experts. The peasant proprietors of France\r\nare equally fortunate in this respect; over and above the abundant\r\nharvest of cereals they grow vine and oranges and have been highly\r\nsuccessful in sericulture; while the silk industry, in its very cradle,\r\nso to speak, namely Murshidabad and Malda, is languishing and is in a\r\nmoribund condition.\r\n\r\n\"Various forms of cattle plague, e.g., render pest, foot and mouth\r\ndisease, make havoc of our cattle every year and the ignorant masses\r\nsteeped in superstitions, look helplessly on and ascribe the visitations\r\nto the wrath of the Goddess Sitala. It is useless to din Pasteur's\r\nresearches into their ears. As I have said before, our Government has\r\nthe happy knack of beginning at the wrong end. An ignorant people and a\r\ncostly machinery of scientific experts ill go together.\r\n\r\n\"The panacea recommended for the cure and treatment of all these ills is\r\nthe foundation or re-organization of costly bureaus and Scientific and\r\nTechnical services, the latter with the differentiation of \"Imperial\"\r\nand the 'Provincial' Services, which are in reality hotbeds for the\r\nbreeding of racial antipathies and sedition. For the recruitment of the\r\nScientific Services the Commissioners coolly propose that not only\r\nsenior and experienced men should be obtained at as early an age as\r\npossible, preferably not exceeding 25 years. What lamentable ignorance\r\nthe Commissioners betray and what poor conception they have of this\r\nvital question is further evident from what they say:\r\n\r\n\"'We should thus secure the University graduate, who had done one or\r\nperhaps two years' post-graduate work whether scientific or practical,\r\nbut would not yet be confirmed in specialization. We assume that the\r\nrequisite degree of specialization will be secured by adopting a system\r\nwhereby study leave will be granted at some suitable time after three\r\nyears' service, when a scientific officer should have developed the\r\ndistinct bent.' In other words, secure a dark horse and wait till he\r\ndevelops a distinct bent! The writer of this article naturally feels a\r\nlittle at home on this subject and it is only necessary to cite a few\r\ninstances to illustrate how, under the proposed scheme Indians will\r\nfare. At the present moment there are four young Indian Doctors of\r\nScience of British universities, three belonging to that of London. Two\r\nof them only have been able to secure Government appointments, but these\r\nonly temporary, drawing two-thirds of the grade pay. One has already\r\ngiven up his post in disgust because he could get no assurance that the\r\npost would be made permanent. In fact, both of them have been given\r\ndistinctly to understand that as soon as the war conditions are over,\r\npermanent incumbents for these posts will be recruited at \"home.\" In\r\nfilling up the posts of the so-called experts one very important factor\r\nis overlooked. As a rule, only third rate men care to come out to India.\r\nThe choice lies between the best brains of India and the mediocres of\r\nEngland and yet the former get but scant consideration and justice....\r\nThe creation of so many Scientific \"Imperial\" services means practically\r\nso many close preserves for Europeans.\"\r\n\r\nIn the chapter dealing with Industrial and Technical training the\r\nCommission observes:\r\n\r\n\"The system of education introduced by the Government was, at the\r\noutset, mainly intended to provide for the administrative needs of the\r\ncountry and encouraged literary and philosophic studies to the neglect\r\nof those of more practical character. In the result it created a\r\ndisproportionate number of persons possessing purely literary education,\r\nat a time when there was hardly any form of practical education in\r\nexistence. Naturally, the market value of the services of persons so\r\neducated began eventually to diminish. Throughout the nineteenth century\r\nthe policy of the Government was controlled by the doctrine of\r\n_laissez-faire_ in commercial and industrial matters, and its efforts to\r\ndevelop the resources of the country were largely limited to the\r\nprovision of improved methods of transport and the construction of\r\nirrigation works. Except in Bombay, the introduction of modern methods\r\nof manufacture was almost entirely confined to the European community.\r\nThe opportunities for gaining experience were not easy for Indians to\r\ncome by, and there was no attempt at technical training for industries\r\nuntil nearly the end of the century, and then only on an inadequate\r\nscale. The non-existence of a suitable education to qualify Indians for\r\nposts requiring industrial or technical knowledge was met by the\r\nimportation of men from Europe, who supervised and trained illiterate\r\nIndian labor in the mills and factories that were started. From this\r\nclass of labor it was impossible to obtain the higher type of artisan\r\ncapable of supervisory work.\"\r\n\r\nAfter pointing out the lamentable deficiency and comparative failure of\r\nthe half-hearted measures so far taken by the Government to provide some\r\nkind of technical education the Commission makes certain recommendations\r\nfor meeting the needs of the situation, which are supplemented by some\r\npertinent suggestions made by the Honorable Malaviya in his minority\r\nreport. The aforesaid summary concludes with the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"To sum up, the Commission finds that India is a country rich in raw\r\nmaterials and in industrial possibilities, but poor in manufacturing\r\naccomplishments. The deficiencies in her industrial system are such as\r\nto render her liable to foreign penetration in time of peace and to\r\nserious danger in time of war. Her labor is inefficient, but for this\r\nreason capable of vast improvement. She relies almost entirely on\r\nforeign sources for foremen and supervisors; and her intelligentsia have\r\nyet to develop the right tradition of industrialism. Her stores of money\r\nlie inert and idle.[3] The necessity of securing the economic safety of\r\nthe country and the inability of the people to secure it without the\r\nco-operation and stimulation of Government impose, therefore, on\r\nGovernment policy of energetic intervention in industrial affairs; and\r\nto discharge the multifarious activities which this policy demands,\r\nGovernment must be provided with a suitable industrial equipment in the\r\nform of imperial and provincial departments of Industries.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Italics are ours.\r\n\r\n[2] Italics are ours.\r\n\r\n[3] Are there any such stores? If so, where?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B\r\n\r\nA BRIEF COMPARATIVE STATEMENT OF THE PRESENT INDIAN CONSTITUTION, THE\r\nMONTAGU-CHELMSFORD SCHEME OF REFORMS AND THE CONGRESS-LEAGUE REFORM\r\nPROPOSALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT CONSTITUTION OF INDIA\r\n\r\n_Under the Government of India Act, 1915_ (5 & 6 Geo. 5, c. 61).\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE SECRETARY OF STATE IN COUNCIL\r\n\r\n(1) His Majesty's Secretary of State for India superintends, directs,\r\nand controls all acts relating to the government or revenues of India.\r\nHe is responsible to Parliament. He or his Council has no legislative\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n(2) The Council of India consists of 10 to 14 members, appointed by the\r\nSecretary of State for a term of seven years; and the majority of\r\nCouncil must sanction expenditure of revenue and certain other specified\r\nmatters. In practice two of the members have been Indians since 1907.\r\n\r\n(3) The salaries of the Secretary of State, the Under-Secretaries and\r\nthe Office establishment are paid out of Indian revenues.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA\r\n\r\n(1) _General._--The Governor-General of India is appointed by the Crown.\r\nHe has the absolute power of adopting, suspending or rejecting measures\r\naffecting safety, tranquillity and interest of India.\r\n\r\n(2) _Executive Council._--The Executive Council consists of five or six\r\nordinary members appointed by the Crown generally for five years, with\r\nthe Commander-in-chief as an extraordinary member. Governor-General in\r\nCouncil is the supreme autocratic authority in India in all\r\nadministrative matters, and it directly administers certain Imperial\r\nDepartments. One member of Council is now an Indian.\r\n\r\n(3) _Legislative Council._--For the purpose of legislation the Council\r\nconsists of all Executive members with 60 additional members, of whom\r\nonly 27 are elected by specified electorates by a method of indirect\r\nelection. There is separate representation for Mohammedans. The\r\nGovernor-General is the President of the Council.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Legislative Council can discuss the Budget, move\r\nresolutions or ask questions, but the Executive Government is not bound\r\nthereby. In other words the Legislative has no control over the purse or\r\nthe acts of the Executive.\r\n\r\nEvery act of the Legislative requires the assent of the\r\nGovernor-General, and the Crown may also disallow the same. Besides in\r\ncases of emergency the Governor-General has the power to promulgate laws\r\nin the shape of ordinances, without reference to the Legislative\r\nCouncil, on his own initiative or on the recommendation of Provincial\r\nGovernments. These ordinances to be in force for six months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTAGU-CHELMSFORD SCHEME OF REFORMS\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE SECRETARY OF STATE IN COUNCIL\r\n\r\n(1) His Majesty's Secretary of State to be retained, but his salary to\r\nbe transferred to British Estimates.\r\n\r\n(2 & 3) A Committee is appointed to examine and report on the present\r\nconstitution of the Council of India as well as the Office\r\nestablishment. (The report of the Committee is not yet made.)\r\n\r\n(4) The House of Commons to be asked to appoint a Select Committee for\r\nIndian affairs.\r\n\r\n(5) Control of Parliament and the Secretary of State to be modified.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA\r\n\r\n(1) _General._--The Government of India to preserve indisputable\r\nauthority on all matters relating to peace, order, and good Government.\r\nIt is to remain fully autocratic as at present.\r\n\r\nA Privy Council to be established in India.\r\n\r\n(2) _The Executive Council._--To continue as before with maximum limit\r\nremoved, but the Indian element is to be increased to two members.\r\n\r\nGovernment to be empowered to appoint a limited number of members (not\r\nnecessarily elected) of the Legislative Council as Under-Secretaries,\r\nsimilar to Parliamentary Under-Secretaries in England.\r\n\r\n(3) _Legislative Council._--There will be two legislative Bodies. One to\r\nbe called _Legislative Assembly_ (with elected majority), and the other\r\nthe _Council of State_ (with official majority).\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Assembly is to consist of 100 members, two-thirds of\r\nwhom would be elected. Of the nominated not less than one-third should\r\nbe non-officials. President to be nominated by the Governor-General.\r\n\r\nThe Council of State to consist of 50 members, of whom 21 are to be\r\nelected. The Governor-General is to be the President.\r\n\r\nBills passed by the Assembly must also be referred to the Council of\r\nState, the differences, if any, being settled by a joint session. But in\r\ncases where the interests of peace, order and good Government, including\r\nsound financial administration, are concerned, Governor-General shall\r\nhave powers to refer a Bill to the Council of State and it will become\r\nlaw in the form approved by the Council of State even though it is not\r\nacceptable to the Assembly.\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly and the Council of State may discuss the Budget,\r\nask questions, and pass resolutions, but they are not binding on the\r\nExecutive.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General to retain his power of assenting to Acts and\r\npromulgating ordinances on his own authority. The Crown may disallow any\r\nAct.\r\n\r\nThe Montagu-Chelmsford Scheme proposes periodical (decennial)\r\nParliamentary inquiries to revise the constitution, both for the Central\r\nand the Provincial Governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGRESS-LEAGUE REFORM PROPOSALS\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE SECRETARY OF STATE IN COUNCIL\r\n\r\n(1) The Secretary of State to be retained. But his salary to be\r\ntransferred to British Estimates.\r\n\r\n(2) The Council of India be abolished.\r\n\r\n(3) There should be two permanent Under-Secretaries, one of whom should\r\nbe an Indian. The charges of the Indian Office establishment should be\r\ntransferred to British Estimates.\r\n\r\n(4) The proposed Select Committee of the House of Commons is not\r\nobjected to.\r\n\r\n(5) The Secretary of State for India should eventually occupy the same\r\nposition as the Colonial Secretary. The control of Parliament and\r\nSecretary of State be modified only with the transfer of responsibility\r\nof the Government of India to the electorate.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA\r\n\r\n(1) _General._--The Government of India shall have undivided authority\r\nin matters concerning Peace, Tranquillity and Defence of the Country;\r\nbut _subject to a Statutory Declaration_ of the rights of the people of\r\nIndia as British citizens, viz., that all Indians are equal before law,\r\nequally entitled to a licence to bear arms and to have the freedom of\r\nspeech, writing, and meeting, and also the freedom of the Press, and\r\nthat no one be punished or deprived of his liberty except by a sentence\r\nof a Court of Justice.\r\n\r\nThat the principle of Responsible Government should be applied to the\r\nCentral Administration by dividing the subjects into (1) reserved (2)\r\ntransferred. The reserved subjects to be administered by Government\r\nwithout popular control. The reserved subjects shall be Foreign affairs\r\n(except relations with Colonies, and Dominions), Army, Navy, and\r\nrelations with Indian Ruling Princes, as well as matters affecting\r\npublic peace, tranquillity, defence of the country subject to the\r\nDeclarations of Rights mentioned above. All other subjects should be\r\ntransferred subjects--_i.e._, transferred to the popular control\r\nexercised by the enlarged Legislative Assembly.\r\n\r\nThere should be no Privy Council.\r\n\r\n(2) _Executive Council._--The Executive Council shall consist partly of\r\nMinisters, from the Elected members of tie Legislative Council, and in\r\ncharge of the transferred subjects; and other members nominated by the\r\nGovernment in charge of the reserved subjects. When there are two or\r\nmore members in charge of the reserved subjects, half the number shall\r\nbe Indians.\r\n\r\n(3) _Legislative Council._--There should be no Council of State, but only\r\none Legislative Assembly composed of 150 members, four-fifths of whom\r\nshould be elected directly by the people. The Franchise should be as\r\nbroad as possible without distinction of sex, but with a proportional\r\nand communal representation for Mohammedans as settled at Lucknow. The\r\nAssembly should have an elected President. (The Moslem League does not\r\nobject to the Council of State if at least half the members thereof\r\nwould be elected).\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Assembly should have the same measure of fiscal autonomy\r\nas Self-Governing Dominions, and should control the Budget, excepting\r\nthe reserved subjects, the allotment for which shall be a first charge\r\non the Revenues. All Bills must be introduced and passed in the\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nProvided that in the case of reserved subjects if the Legislative\r\nAssembly does not pass measures desired by Government, the\r\nGovernor-General in Council may provide for the same by regulations.\r\nSuch regulations will remain in force for one year, and shall not be\r\nrenewed unless 40 per cent (two-fifths of the members) of the\r\nLegislative Assembly present and voting are in favour of them.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General to retain his existing power of making ordinances\r\nand the Governor-General in Council the power of passing regulations.\r\nThe Governor-General and the Crown to have also power of assent,\r\nreservation or disallowance.\r\n\r\nThe Congress-League scheme objects to periodical Commissions for\r\nrevising the Constitution, and asks for a Statutory declaration that the\r\ntransfer of responsibility should be completed in a period not exceeding\r\n15 years, when India should be placed on a footing of equality with the\r\nother self-governing parts of the Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS\r\n\r\n(1) _General._--India, including Burma, is divided into 14 provinces,\r\neach of which has its own Provincial Government.\r\n\r\nBy a system of decentralisation, revenues are allotted to all these\r\nprovinces by the Government of India. The Provincial Governments\r\nadminister, under the general supervision of the Central Government,\r\nwithout being responsible to the Local Legislatures in any way.\r\n\r\n(2) _Executive._--Bombay, Bengal, and Madras have each a Governor sent\r\nfrom England and three (one of whom is, in practice, an Indian)\r\nExecutive Councillors appointed by the Crown, with a Legislative\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nBihar and Orissa governed by a Lieutenant-Governor with Legislative and\r\nExecutive Councils; United Provinces, Punjab and Burma by a\r\nLieutenant-Governor with only a Legislative Council; Central Provinces\r\nand Assam by a Chief Commissioner with only a Legislative Council, and\r\nthe remaining by Chief Commissioners without any Councils.\r\n\r\n(3) _Legislative._--The Provincial Legislative Councils enjoy limited\r\npowers for legislation in the provinces. The Governor is the President\r\nof the Council.\r\n\r\nThe elected members of the Legislative Council are elected by\r\nconstituencies formed of Municipal and Local Boards, and Landlords with\r\na separate constituency for Mohammedans. They are in a minority except\r\nin Bengal, where they have at present only a small majority. The\r\nLegislative Councils have no control over the Executive or the Budget.\r\n\r\nThe Acts of the Provincial Legislature must be assented to first by the\r\nGovernor, Lieutenant Governor, or the Commissioner as the case may be,\r\nand then by the Governor-General subject always to disallowance by the\r\nCrown.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC SERVICES\r\n\r\nRecruitment, examination, and other matters relating to Indian services\r\nare at present under the control of the Indian Government and the\r\nSecretary of State, with no statutory limit for recruitment in India.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nHalf the members of Municipalities and Local Boards are generally\r\nelected, but the bodies are under official control.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS\r\n\r\n(1) _General._--All Provinces having Legislative Councils at present\r\n(except Burma) should have a Governor with Executive and Legislative\r\nCouncils. A complete separation will be made between Indian and\r\nProvincial Revenues. Provincial Governments are to have certain powers\r\nof taxation and borrowing.\r\n\r\nResponsible Government is to be introduced in the Provinces by a\r\ndivision of departments into reserved (for Government) and transferred\r\n(to popular control) subject to a revision after five years. (A\r\nCommittee is appointed to settle which subjects should be transferred.\r\nThe report is not yet out.)\r\n\r\n(2) _The Executive_ would be a kind of Diarchy, consisting of the\r\nGovernor and two members (one of whom is to be an Indian) who will be in\r\ncharge of the reserved subjects, and responsible only to Government; and\r\na Minister or Ministers, nominated by the Governor from the elected\r\nmembers of the Council, who will be in charge of the transferred\r\nsubjects and responsible not to the Legislature, but to the electors who\r\nmay not elect him next time. There may also be additional members\r\nwithout Portfolios for the purpose of consultation.\r\n\r\nMinisters to have no voice in decisions concerning reserved subjects or\r\nabout the supply for them in the Budget.\r\n\r\nThere will be Under-Secretaries and Standing Committees from the members\r\nof the Legislative Councils to assist the Executive.\r\n\r\n(3) _Legislative Councils._--These would be practically two Provincial\r\nLegislative Bodies: (1) Legislative Council. (2) Grand Committee.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Council will have a substantial elected majority,\r\nelected on a broad franchise with Governor as President. (A Commission\r\nis appointed to inquire into the question of franchise and the\r\ncomposition of the Council, but the report is not yet out.)\r\n\r\nThe Grand Committee will comprise only from 40 to 50 per cent of\r\nLegislative Council, and its members will be partly elected by a ballot\r\nand partly appointed by nomination.\r\n\r\nAll Legislation and the Budget for transferred subjects only must be\r\npassed in the Legislative Councils.\r\n\r\nBut when the Governor certifies that a bill dealing with reserved\r\nsubjects is essential he may refer the Bill to the Grand Committee and\r\nhave it finally passed there.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Legislative Council can ask questions and pass\r\nresolutions, but the latter are not binding on the Executive, except\r\nresolutions on the Budget for the transferred subjects.\r\n\r\nAll Provincial Legislation requires the assent of the Governor and the\r\nGovernor-General, and is also subject to disallowance by His Majesty.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC SERVICE\r\n\r\nRacial bars should not exist. In addition to recruitment in England a\r\nsystem of appointment to all public services be established in India\r\nwith an increasing percentage of recruitment. In the case of Indian\r\nCivil Service the percentage should be 33 of the superior posts, with\r\nannual increment of 1-1/2 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nComplete popular control in Local Bodies to be established as far as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS\r\n\r\n(1) _General._--There should be a complete separation of the Provincial\r\nfrom the Imperial Revenues. All Provincial Governments should have\r\ncertain powers of taxation and borrowing.\r\n\r\n(2) _Executive._--Full responsible Government should be introduced into\r\nthe Provinces. The Executive will thus consist of the Governor and\r\nMinisters responsible to the Legislature. There should be no distinction\r\nof transferred or reserved subjects.\r\n\r\n(3) _Legislative._--There should be only one Legislative Council, having\r\nfour-fifths of its members elected on a broad franchise without\r\ndistinction of sex, but with a proportional and communal representation\r\nfor the Mohammedans. The Legislative Council should elect its own\r\nPresident, and must have control over the Budget. All Bills must be\r\nintroduced and passed in this Legislative Council.\r\n\r\nThe Governor to retain his power of assent, and the Governor-General and\r\nthe Crown the power of assent or disallowance.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC SERVICES\r\n\r\nServices should be recruited in India in a fixed and progressive\r\nproportion. The annual recruitment in India for the Indian Civil Service\r\nshould be 50 per cent to start with, and that Indians be granted at\r\nleast 25 per cent of the Commissions in Army and the proportion be\r\ngradually increased. There should be no racial distinctions.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nMunicipal and Local Bodies should be completely under popular control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORTS OF COMMITTEES ON FRANCHISES AND DIVISION OF FUNCTIONS\r\n\r\n(_London Times_ May 13, 1919)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The reports of the two Committees which sat in India from early in\r\n    November to the end of February last to fill out the framework of\r\n    the Montagu-Chelmsford Report published last July were issued last\r\n    night.\r\n\r\n    The Franchise Committee, of which Lord Southborough was chairman,\r\n    recommend a scheme of territorial constituencies, urban and rural,\r\n    the latter based on the existing land revenue districts, together\r\n    with communal representation for Mohammedans and Sikhs (as\r\n    contemplated in the original scheme) and for Indian Christians,\r\n    Europeans, and Anglo-Indians: and the representation of special\r\n    interests, including commerce and industry.\r\n\r\n    The other Committee, of which Mr. R. Feetham was chairman, make\r\n    detailed recommendations as to the division of functions between\r\n    the Government of India and the provincial Governments, and also\r\n    between \"reserved\" and \"transferred\" subjects in the provinces.\r\n    Proposals are made for the modification in some important respects\r\n    (notably in the powers conferred on the Governor) of the\r\n    \"diarchial\" system in the provinces set forth in what is\r\n    conveniently called the \"Joint Report.\"\r\n\r\nAs was indicated in _The Times_ on April 5, Lord Southborough's\r\nCommittee have not accepted the appeals addressed to them in the\r\ninterest of woman suffrage. They found it advocated \"rather on general\r\ngrounds than on considerations of practicability.\" They are satisfied\r\nthat the social conditions of India would make such a step now\r\npremature. They are of opinion, however, that at the revision of the\r\nconstitutions of the councils proposed in the Joint Report 10 years\r\nafter their reconstitution the matter should be reconsidered in the\r\nlight of the experience gained and of social conditions as they then\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCHISE QUALIFICATIONS\r\n\r\nThe general proposals for the franchise are based upon the principle of\r\nresidence and the possession of certain property qualifications. In\r\naddition the enfranchisement of all retired and pensioned officers of\r\nthe Indian Army, whether of commissioned or non-commissioned rank, is\r\nrecommended. This step was universally and strongly recommended in the\r\nPunjab, and it is to extend to all provinces. The property qualification\r\nis adapted to local conditions and is guided by the principle that the\r\nfranchise should be as broad as possible, consistently with the\r\navoidance of any such inordinate extension as might lead to a breakdown\r\nof the machinery of election through weight of numbers. The large\r\nproportion of illiterate voters, in the absence of a literary test, may\r\ncause difficulty, but it has already been faced successfully in\r\nmunicipal elections in India by the use of coloured ballot-boxes and\r\nother like devices.\r\n\r\nNo rigid uniformity of property qualification has been sought, but the\r\ncommittee have proposed the same qualification for all communities\r\nwithin the same area. A substantially higher proportion of the urban\r\nthan of the rural population will be enfranchised. At present the total\r\nnumber of electors for the provincial councils is 33,007, and of these\r\nno fewer than 17,448 are Mohammedans, since that community enjoys direct\r\nrepresentation on an individual basis. The number of voters will be\r\nraised under the scheme to 5,179,000, being 2.34 per cent of the total\r\npopulation in the eight provinces, which is nearly 220,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe long established administrative unit of the \"district\" is made the\r\nterritorial area for constituencies but the relatively few cities with\r\nlarge populations are to be separately represented. Occasionally towns\r\nare grouped into separate urban constituencies. Single-member\r\nconstituencies are the general rule, but latitude is left to the local\r\nGovernments. Plural voting is to be forbidden, but this does not apply\r\nto electors in constituencies formed for the representation of special\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL COMMUNITIES\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the recognition of the Joint Report that separate\r\nMohammedan representation cannot be abandoned, the scheme provides for\r\nMohammedan constituencies. The compact of the joint session of the\r\nNational Congress and the Moslem League at Lucknow in December, 1916, is\r\naccepted as a guide in allocating the proportion of Mohammedan seats. In\r\nthe Punjab this facility is to be extended to the Sikhs. Beyond this the\r\nframers of the Joint Report did not propose to go; but Lord\r\nSouthborough's Committee recommend separate electorates, where the\r\nnumbers justify that course, for Indian Christians, Europeans, and the\r\ndomiciled \"Anglo-Indians\"--_i.e._, country-born Europeans and Eurasians.\r\nIt is observed that candidates belonging to these communities would have\r\nno chance of being elected by general constituencies. The hope is\r\nexpressed that it will be possible \"at no very distant date to merge all\r\ncommunities into one general electorate.\"\r\n\r\nOther claims for separate electorates are not conceded. Regret is\r\nexpressed that the organized non-Brahmans of the Madras Presidency\r\nrefuse to appear before the Committee. It is pointed out that there the\r\nnon-Brahmans (omitting the depressed or \"untouchable\" classes) outnumber\r\nthe Brahmans by about 22 to one; and on the basis of enfranchisement\r\ntaken in Madras the non-Brahmans would be in the proportion of four to\r\none. It is held to be unreasonable to adopt the proposed expedient for a\r\ncommunity which has an overwhelming electoral strength.\r\n\r\nThe alternative of reserving a considerable number of seats for\r\nnon-Brahmans in plural member constituencies did not commend itself to a\r\nsection of the non-Brahmans, though evidence went to show that such a\r\nproposal might be accepted by the Brahmans \"if it were the price of an\r\nenduring peace.\" It is suggested that his Majesty's Government might\r\nafford the parties to the controversy an opportunity, before the\r\nelectoral machinery for the Presidency is completed, of agreeing upon\r\nsome solution--_e.g._, the provision of plural member constituencies and\r\nof a certain proportion of guaranteed non-Brahman seats.\r\n\r\nThe separate representation of zamindars and landholders granted under\r\nthe Morley-Minto scheme is extended and provision made for university\r\nseats. The election by accredited bodies of representatives of commerce\r\nand industry is also continued and amplified. There is to be nomination\r\nfor the representation of the \"depressed classes,\" for in no case was it\r\nfound possible to provide an electorate on any satisfactory system of\r\nfranchise. Labour is to be represented by nomination where the\r\nindustrial conditions seem likely to give rise to labour problems. The\r\nmajority of the Committee are of opinion that dismissal from Government\r\nservice should constitute a bar to candidature if it has taken place in\r\ncircumstances which, in the opinion of the Governor in Council, involve\r\nmoral turpitude; but Lord Southborough, Mr. S. N. Bannerjea, and Mr.\r\nSastri dissent, considering it improper to limit the choice of the\r\nelectorate by a disqualification based on the decision of an executive\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nThe size of the Provincial Legislatures will vary from 53 in Assam to\r\n125 in Bengal. The eight Councils will comprise 796 members, made up as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  Elected by general constituencies, 308.\r\n  By communities, 185.\r\n  By landholders, 35.\r\n  By universities, 8.\r\n  By commercial, industrial, and planting interests, 45.\r\n  The nominated representatives will number 47, and the officials, 128.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"ALL-INDIA\" BODY\r\n\r\nFor the Indian Legislative Assembly, the Committee propose 80 elected\r\nmembers, instead of the 68 suggested in the Joint Report. Fourteen\r\nrepresentatives appointed by nomination and 26 officials (including\r\nseven _ex-officio_ members) will bring up the total, exclusive of the\r\nGovernor-General, to 120, as compared with 68 at present. A statement of\r\nthe manifold difficulties in the way of direct election for this\r\nAll-India body leads to the conclusion that there must be indirect\r\nelection for all general and communal seats by the members of the\r\nProvincial Legislatures. \"We trust that, in progress of time, a growing\r\nsense of political organization will enable indirect election to be\r\nsuperseded by some direct method.\"\r\n\r\nA scheme for the creation of the \"Council of State\" on the lines of the\r\nJoint Report is set forth, on the basis of election thereto by\r\nnon-official members of the Provincial Councils. There would be 24\r\nelected and 32 _ex-officio_ or nominated members, exclusive of the\r\nGovernor-General. The electors should be left free to choose any person\r\nqualified to be a member of a Provincial Legislature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIVISION OF FUNCTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n    The first duty of Mr. Feetham's Committee was to consider what were\r\n    the services to be appropriated to the provinces, all others\r\n    remaining with the Government of India. The Committee proceeded on\r\n    the basis that there is to be no such statutory demarcation of\r\n    powers as to leave the validity of Acts passed to be challenged in\r\n    the Courts. In other words, no alteration is proposed in the system\r\n    under which the All-India Legislature as regards British India, and\r\n    each of the Provincial Legislatures as regards its own province,\r\n    have in theory concurrent jurisdiction over the whole legislative\r\n    field.\r\n\r\nIn framing the lists the Committee have treated as All-India subjects\r\ncertain large general heads, such, for instance, as commerce and laws\r\nregarding property, but have taken out of these and allotted to the\r\nprovinces important sections--_e.g._, in the case of the first Excise,\r\nand in the case of the second laws regarding land tenure. Any matter\r\nincluded in the provincial list is to be deemed to be excluded from any\r\nAll-India subject of which otherwise it would form part. Subjects not\r\nexpressly included in either list are regarded as All-India subjects,\r\nbut the Governor-General in Council may add to the provincial list\r\n\"matters of merely local or private interest within the province.\" It is\r\nclaimed that the scheme has been devised on such a basis as to leave the\r\nway open for the process of development.\r\n\r\nThe list of subjects to be transferred to Indian Ministers is on the\r\nwhole more extensive than the suggested list attached to the Joint\r\nReport. With certain reservations University education is to be\r\ntransferred, as well as primary, secondary, and technical, on the ground\r\nthat the educational system must be regarded as an organic whole. But\r\nEuropean and Anglo-Indian education, which is organized on a separate\r\nbasis is excluded from the transfer.\r\n\r\nThe decision of the functions of the Provincial Government, popularly\r\nknown as diarchy, has been criticized as likely to lead to friction, and\r\nsometimes to deadlock. To mitigate these difficulties, the Committee\r\npropose important changes in the relations of the Governor with both\r\nsections of the Government. It is to be the duty of the Governor in\r\nCouncil in the case of reserved departments, and of the Governor and\r\nMinisters in the case of transferred departments, to take care that the\r\nadministration is so conducted as not to prejudice or occasion undue\r\ninterference with the working of any department falling in the other\r\ncategory. The Governor has to decide whether a particular matter falls\r\nwithin the scope of a reserved or a transferred department, and to take\r\ncare that any order given by the Governor-General in Council is complied\r\nwith by the department concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR'S INCREASED POWERS\r\n\r\nIn the case of disagreement between the Executive Council and Ministers\r\nas to action which appears to the Governor to affect both a reserved and\r\na transferred department, the Governor is to give such decision as the\r\ninterests of good government may seem to require, provided that, in so\r\nfar as circumstances admit, before such decision is given the matter\r\nshould be considered by both sections of the Government sitting\r\ntogether. If the Minister remains obdurate, it will be for the Governor\r\nto dismiss and find another Minister.\r\n\r\nIf, owing to a vacancy, there is no Minister in charge of a transferred\r\ndepartment, the Governor will certify that such emergency exists and\r\nthat immediate action is necessary. On such certificate being given, the\r\nGovernor in Council will have authority to take action, subject to the\r\nobligation of reporting to the Governor-General in Council. In other\r\nwords there will be re-entry for a temporary and limited purpose during\r\nan interregnum. This is a considerable departure from the proposal of\r\nthe Joint Report that Ministers shall hold office for the lifetime of\r\nthe Legislative Council. The power of the Governor to dismiss a\r\nMinister, says the report, \"seems essential if deadlocks are to be\r\navoided.\" The over-ruling of a minister will depend in the last resort\r\non the Governor's personal judgment of the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINANCE\r\n\r\nThe Committee felt themselves precluded from considering any\r\nmodification of the proposals of the Joint Report for the separation of\r\nthe finances of the Government of India and of Provincial Governments.\r\nNo opinion is expressed on memoranda received at a late stage from Sir\r\nJames Meston making proposals for substantial departure from the plan of\r\ndealing with provincial finance set forth in the Joint Report.\r\n\r\nIt may be recalled that Mr. Montagu and Lord Chelmsford proposed that,\r\nif the residue of the provincial revenues is not sufficient, it should\r\nbe open to Ministers to suggest fresh taxation. The Committee take the\r\nview that when any new provincial tax or any proposed addition to an\r\nexisting tax requires legislation to give effect to it, the decision\r\nwhether that legislation should be undertaken must rest with the\r\nGovernor and Ministers. Since the whole balance of the revenues of the\r\nprovince will be at the disposal of the Ministers for the administration\r\nof the transferred departments, the Committee consider that when an\r\nexisting tax cannot be reduced or remitted without legislation, the\r\ndecision whether legislation should be undertaken must also rest with\r\nthe Governor and Ministers. To that extent taxation for provincial\r\npurposes should be regarded as a transferred subject.\r\n\r\nThe assessment or collection of the tax would be reserved or\r\ntransferred, according as the agency employed belonged to a reserved or\r\nto a transferred department. The view is also taken that, when\r\nalterations in taxation can be effected without any change in the law,\r\nthe decision whether any alteration should in fact be made must be\r\nrecognized as resting with the Governor in Council if the department is\r\nreserved, and with the Governor and Ministers if it is transferred.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the powers of borrowing on the sole credit of provincial\r\nrevenues which are to be conferred, the Committee propose that, if after\r\njoint deliberation there is a difference of opinion between the\r\nExecutive Council and the Ministers, the final decision whether a loan\r\nshould be raised and as to the amount of the loan must rest with the\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLIC SERVICES\r\n\r\nDetailed proposals are made in relation to the public services, to be\r\nclassified as Indian (All-India), provincial and subordinate, No service\r\nis to be included in the first of these categories without the sanction\r\nof the Secretary of State, while the demarcation between the provincial\r\nand subordinate services is to be left to the provincial Governments.\r\n\r\nGeneral approval is given to a scheme prepared by the Government of\r\nIndia providing that legislation should be undertaken in Parliament to\r\ndeclare the tenure and provide for the classification of the public\r\nservice. It should secure the pensions of the All-India services, and\r\nshould empower the Secretary of State to make rules for their conduct\r\nand rights and liabilities, and to fix their pay and regulate their\r\nallowances. Similar legislation should be passed by the Government of\r\nIndia in respect to the provincial services, and to empower the\r\nprovincial Governments to make rules for the subordinate services.
