In the division on the Civil War there has been substituted in\r\nthe new edition, for Mr. Schurz's speech on the Democratic War\r\nPolicy the spirited discussion between Breckenridge and Baker on the\r\nsuppression of insurrection. The scene in which these two speeches were\r\ndelivered in the United States Senate at the opening of the Civil war\r\nis full of historic and dramatic interest, while the speeches themselves\r\nare examples of superior oratory. Mr. Schurz appears to advantage in\r\nanother part of the volume in his address on Civil Service Reform.\r\n\r\nThe speeches of Thaddeus Stevens and Henry J. Raymond, delivered at the\r\nopening of the Reconstruction struggle under President Johnson, are\r\nalso new material in this edition. They are fairly representative of two\r\ndistinct views in that period of the controversy. These two speeches are\r\nsubstituted for the Garfield-Blackburn discussion over a \"rider\" to\r\nan appropriation bill designed to forbid federal control of elections\r\nwithin the States. This discussion was only incidental to the problem\r\nof reconstruction, and may be said to have occurred at a time (1879)\r\nsubsequent to the close of the Reconstruction period proper.\r\n\r\nThe material on Free Trade and Protection has been left unchanged\r\nfor the reason that it appears to the present editor quite useless to\r\nattempt to secure better material on the tariff discussion. There might\r\nbe added valuable similar material from later speeches on the tariff,\r\nbut the two speeches of Clay and Hurd may be said to contain the\r\nessential merits of the long-standing tariff debate.\r\n\r\nThe section of the volume devoted to Finance and Civil Service Reform\r\nis entirely new. The two speeches of Curtis and Schurz are deemed\r\nsufficient to set forth the merits of the movement for the reform of\r\nthe Civil Service. The magnitude of our financial controversies during a\r\ncentury of our history precludes the possibility of securing an adequate\r\nrepresentation of them in speeches which might come within the scope of\r\nsuch a volume as this. It has, therefore, seemed best to the editor to\r\nconfine the selections on Finance to the period since the Civil War, and\r\nto the subject of coinage, rather than to attempt to include also the\r\nkindred subjects of banking and paper currency. The four representative\r\nspeeches on the coinage will, however, bring into view the various\r\nprinciples of finance which have determined the differences and\r\ndivisions in party opinion on all phases of this great subject.\r\n\r\nJ. A. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--CIVIL WAR AND RECONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nTHE transformation of the original secession movement into a _de facto_\r\nnationality made war inevitable, but acts of war had already taken\r\nplace, with or without State authority. Seizures of forts, arsenals,\r\nmints, custom-houses, and navy yards, and captures of Federal troops,\r\nhad completely extinguished the authority of the United States in\r\nthe secession area, except at Fort Sumter in South Carolina, and Fort\r\nPickens and the forts at Key West in Florida; and active operations to\r\nreduce these had been begun. When an attempt was made, late in January,\r\n1861, to provision Fort Sumter, the provision steamer, Star of the\r\nWest, was fired on by the South Carolina batteries and driven back.\r\nNevertheless, the Buchanan administration succeeded in keeping the peace\r\nuntil its constitutional expiration in March, 1861, although the rival\r\nand irreconcilable administration at Montgomery was busily engaged in\r\nsecuring its exclusive authority in the seceding States.\r\n\r\nNeither of the two incompatible administrations was anxious to strike\r\nthe first blow. Mr. Lincoln's administration began with the policy\r\noutlined in his inaugural address, that of insisting on collection of\r\nthe duties on imports, and avoiding all other irritating measures. Mr.\r\nSeward, Secretary of State, even talked of compensating for the loss of\r\nthe seceding States by admissions from Canada and elsewhere. The urgent\r\nneeds of Fort Sumter, however, soon forced an attempt to provision\r\nit; and this brought on a general attack upon it by the Confederate\r\nbatteries around it. After a bombardment of two days, and a vigorous\r\ndefence by the fort, in which no one was killed on either side, the fort\r\nsurrendered, April 14, 1861. It was now impossible for the United States\r\nto ignore the Confederate States any longer. President Lincoln issued\r\na call for volunteers, and a proclamation announcing a blockade of the\r\ncoast of the seceding States. A similar call on the other side and the\r\nissue of letters of marque and reprisal against the commerce of the\r\nUnited States were followed by an act of the Confederate Congress\r\nformally recognizing the existence of war with the United States.\r\nThe two powers were thus locked in a struggle for life or death, the\r\nConfederate States fighting for existence and recognition, the United\r\nStates for the maintenance of recognized boundaries and jurisdiction;\r\nthe Confederate States claiming to be at war with a foreign power, the\r\nUnited States to be engaged in the suppression of individual resistance\r\nto the laws. The event was to decide between the opposing claims; and it\r\nwas certain that the event must be the absolute extinction of either the\r\nConfederate States or the United States within the area of secession.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln called Congress together in special session, July 4,\r\n1861; and Congress at once undertook to limit the scope of the war\r\nin regard to two most important points, slavery and State rights.\r\nResolutions passed both Houses, by overwhelming majorities, that slavery\r\nin the seceding States was not to be interfered with, that the autonomy\r\nof the States themselves was to be strictly maintained, and that, when\r\nthe Union was made secure, the war ought to cease. If the war had ended\r\nin that month, these resolutions would have been of some value; every\r\nmonth of the extension of the war made them of less value. They were\r\nrepeatedly offered afterward from the Democratic side, but were as\r\nregularly laid on the table. Their theory, however, continued to control\r\nthe Democratic policy to the end of the war.\r\n\r\nFor a time the original policy was to all appearance unaltered. The war\r\nwas against individuals only; and peace was to be made with individuals\r\nonly, the States remaining untouched, but the Confederate States being\r\nblotted out in the process. The only requisite to recognition of a\r\nseceding State was to be the discovery of enough loyal or pardoned\r\ncitizens to set its machinery going again. Thus the delegates from the\r\nforty western counties of Virginia were recognized as competent to\r\ngive the assent of Virginia to the erection of the new State of West\r\nVirginia; and the Senators and Representatives of the new State actually\r\nsat in judgment on the reconstruction of the parent State, although\r\nthe legality of the parent government was the evident measure of the\r\nconstitutional existence of the new State. Such inconsistencies were\r\nthe natural results of the changes forced upon the Federal policy by the\r\nevents of the war, as it grew wider and more desperate.\r\n\r\nThe first of these changes was the inevitable attack upon slavery.\r\nThe labor system of the seceding States was a mark so tempting that no\r\nbelligerent should have been seriously expected to have refrained from\r\naiming at it. January 1, 1863, after one hundred days' notice, President\r\nLincoln issued his Emancipation Proclamation, freeing the slaves within\r\nthe enemy's lines as rapidly as the Federal arms should advance. This\r\none break in the original policy involved, as possible consequences, all\r\nthe ultimate steps of reconstruction. Read-mission was no longer to be a\r\nsimple restoration; abolition of slavery was to be a condition-precedent\r\nwhich the government could never abandon. If the President could impose\r\nsuch a condition, who was to put bounds to the power of Congress to\r\nimpose limitations on its part? The President had practically declared,\r\ncontrary to the original policy, that the war should continue until\r\nslavery was abolished; what was to hinder Congress from declaring that\r\nthe war should continue until, in its judgment, the last remnants of the\r\nConfederate States were satisfactorily blotted out? This, in effect,\r\nwas the basis of reconstruction, as finally carried out. The steady\r\nopposition of the Democrats only made the final terms the harder.\r\n\r\nThe principle urged consistently from the beginning of the war by\r\nThaddeus Stevens, of Pennsylvania, was that serious resistance to the\r\nConstitution implied the suspension of the Constitution in the area\r\nof resistance. No one, he insisted, could truthfully assert that the\r\nConstitution of the United States was then in force in South Carolina;\r\nwhy should Congress be bound by the Constitution in matters connected\r\nwith South Carolina? If the resistance should be successful, the\r\nsuspension of the Constitution would evidently be perpetual; Congress\r\nalone could decide when the resistance had so far ceased that\r\nthe operations of the Constitution could be resumed. The terms of\r\nreadmission were thus to be laid down by Congress. To much the same\r\neffect was the different theory of Charles Sumner, of Massachusetts.\r\nWhile he held that the seceding States could not remove themselves from\r\nthe national jurisdiction, except by successful war, he maintained\r\nthat no Territory was obliged to become a State, and that no State was\r\nobliged to remain a State; that the seceding States had repudiated their\r\nState-hood, had committed suicide as States, and had become Territories;\r\nand that the powers of Congress to impose conditions on their\r\nreadmission were as absolute as in the case of other Territories.\r\nNeither of these theories was finally followed out in reconstruction,\r\nbut both had a strong influence on the final process.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln followed the plan subsequently completed by Johnson.\r\nThe original (Pierpont) government of Virginia was recognized and\r\nsupported. Similar governments were established in Tennessee, Louisiana,\r\nand Arkansas, and an unsuccessful attempt was made to do so in Florida.\r\nThe amnesty proclamation of December, 1863, offered to recognize any\r\nState government in the seceding States formed by one tenth of the\r\nformer voters who should take the oath of loyalty and support of the\r\nemancipation measures. At the following session of Congress, the first\r\nbill providing for congressional supervision of the readmission of\r\nthe seceding States was passed, but the President retained it without\r\nsigning it until Congress had adjourned. At the time of President\r\nLincoln's assassination Congress was not in session, and President\r\nJohnson had six months in which to complete the work. Provisional\r\ngovernors were appointed, conventions were called, the State\r\nconstitutions were amended by the abolition of slavery and the\r\nrepudiation of the war debt, and the ordinances of secession were either\r\nvoided or repealed. When Congress met in December, 1865, the work had\r\nbeen completed, the new State governments were in operation, and the\r\nXIIIth Amendment, abolishing slavery, had been ratified by aid of their\r\nvotes. Congress, however, still refused to admit their Senators or\r\nRepresentatives. The first action of many of the new governments had\r\nbeen to pass labor, contract, stay, and vagrant laws which looked much\r\nlike a re-establishment of slavery, and the majority in Congress felt\r\nthat further guarantees for the security of the freedmen were necessary\r\nbefore the war could be truly said to be over.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1866 President Johnson imprudently carried matters into an open\r\nquarrel with Congress, which united the two thirds Republican majority\r\nin both Houses against him. The elections of the autumn of 1866 showed\r\nthat the two thirds majorities were to be continued through the next\r\nCongress; and in March, 1867, the first Reconstruction Act was passed\r\nover the veto. It declared the existing governments in the seceding\r\nStates to be provisional only; put the States under military governors\r\nuntil State conventions, elected with negro suffrage and excluding\r\nthe classes named in the proposed XIVth Amendment, should form a State\r\ngovernment satisfactory to Congress, and the State government should\r\nratify the XIVth Amendment; and made this rule of suffrage imperative\r\nin all elections under the provisional governments until they should be\r\nreadmitted. This was a semi-voluntary reconstruction. In the same\r\nmonth the new Congress, which met immediately on the adjournment of\r\nits predecessor, passed a supplementary act. It directed the military\r\ngovernors to call the conventions before September 1st following, and\r\nthus enforced an involuntary reconstruction.\r\n\r\nTennessee had been readmitted in 1866. North Carolina, South Carolina,\r\nFlorida, Alabama, Louisiana, and Arkansas were reconstructed under the\r\nacts, and were readmitted in 1868. Georgia was also readmitted, but was\r\nremanded again for expelling negro members of her Legislature, and came\r\nin under the secondary terms. Virginia, Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas,\r\nwhich had refused or broken the first terms, were admitted in 1870, on\r\nthe additional terms of ratifying the XVth Amendment, which forbade the\r\nexclusion of the negroes from the elective franchise.\r\n\r\nIn Georgia the white voters held control of their State from the\r\nbeginning. In the other seceding States the government passed, at\r\nvarious times and by various methods during the next six years after\r\n1871, under control of the whites, who still retain control. One of the\r\navowed objects of reconstruction has thus failed; but, to one who does\r\nnot presume that all things will be accomplished at a single leap, the\r\nscheme, in spite of its manifest blunders and crudities, must seem to\r\nhave had a remarkable success. Whatever the political status of the\r\nnegro may now be in the seceding States, it may be confidently affirmed\r\nthat it is far better than it would have been in the same time under\r\nan unrestricted readmission. The whites, all whose energies have been\r\nstrained to secure control of their States, have been glad, in return\r\nfor this success to yield a measure of other civil rights to the\r\nfreedmen, which is already fuller than ought to have been hoped for in\r\n1867. And, as the general elective franchise is firmly imbedded in the\r\norganic law, its ultimate concession will come more easily and gently\r\nthan if it were then an entirely new step.\r\n\r\nDuring this long period of almost continuous exertion of national power\r\nthere were many subsidiary measures, such as the laws authorizing the\r\nappointment of supervisors for congressional elections, and the use of\r\nFederal troops as a _posse comitatus_ by Federal supervisors, which\r\nwere not at all in line with the earlier theory of the division between\r\nFederal and State powers. The Democratic party gradually abandoned\r\nits opposition to reconstruction, accepting it as a disagreeable but\r\naccomplished fact, but kept up and increased its opposition to the\r\nsubsidiary measures. About 1876-7 a reaction became evident, and with\r\nPresident Hayes' withdrawal of troops from South Carolina, Federal\r\ncontrol of affairs in the Southern States came to an end.\r\n\r\nForeign affairs are not strictly a part of our subject; but, as going to\r\nshow one of the dangerous features of the Civil War, the possibility\r\nof the success of the secession sentiment in England in obtaining the\r\nintervention of that country, the speech of Mr. Beecher in Liver-pool,\r\nwith the addenda of his audience, has been given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN,\r\n\r\nOF ILLINOIS. (BORN 1809, DIED 1865.)\r\n\r\nFIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS, MARCH 4, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nFELLOW CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a custom as old as the government itself, I appear\r\nbefore you to address you briefly, and to take in your presence the oath\r\nprescribed by the Constitution of the United States to be taken by the\r\nPresident \"before he enters on the execution of his office.\"\r\n\r\nI do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those\r\nmatters of administration about which there is no special anxiety or\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nApprehension seems to exist, among the people of the Southern States,\r\nthat by the accession of a Republican administration their property and\r\ntheir peace and personal security are to be endangered. There never has\r\nbeen any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample\r\nevidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to\r\ntheir inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of\r\nhim who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches\r\nwhen I declare that \"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to\r\ninterfere with the institution of slavery in the States where\r\nit exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no\r\ninclination to do so.\" Those who nominated and elected me did so with\r\nfull knowledge that I had made this and many similar declarations, and\r\nhad never recanted them. And more than this, they placed in the platform\r\nfor my acceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me, the clear and\r\nemphatic resolution which I now read:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the States,\r\nand especially the right of each State to order and control its\r\nown domestic institutions according to its judgment exclusively, is\r\nessential to the balance of power on which the perfection and endurance\r\nof our political fabric depend, and we denounce the lawless invasion by\r\narmed force of the soil of any State or Territory, no matter under what\r\npretext, as among the gravest of crimes.\"\r\n\r\nI now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, I only press upon\r\nthe public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is\r\nsusceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no section are\r\nto be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration. I add,\r\ntoo, that all the protection which, consistently with the Constitution\r\nand the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given to all the States,\r\nwhen lawfully demanded, for whatever cause, as cheerfully to one section\r\nas to another.\r\n\r\nThere is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from\r\nservice or labor. The clause I now read is as plainly written in the\r\nConstitution as any other of its provisions:\r\n\r\n\"No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws\r\nthereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or\r\nregulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall\r\nbe delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may\r\nbe due.\"\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who\r\nmade it for the re-claiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and the\r\nintention of the lawgiver is the law. All members of Congress swear\r\ntheir support to the whole Constitution--to this provision as much as\r\nany other. To the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come within\r\nthe terms of this clause, \"shall be delivered up,\" their oaths are\r\nunanimous. Now, if they would make the effort in good temper, could they\r\nnot, with nearly equal unanimity, frame and pass a law by means of which\r\nto keep good that unanimous oath?\r\n\r\nThere is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be\r\nenforced by National or by State authority; but surely that difference\r\nis not a very material one. If the slave is to be surrendered, it can be\r\nof but little consequence to him, or to others, by what authority it is\r\ndone. And should any one, in any case, be content that his oath should\r\ngo unkept, on a mere unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be\r\nkept?\r\n\r\nAgain, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of\r\nliberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced, so\r\nthat a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave? And might\r\nit not be well, at the same time, to provide by law for the enforcement\r\nof that clause of the Constitution which guarantees that \"the citizens\r\nof each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of\r\ncitizens in the several States\"?\r\n\r\nI take the official oath to-day with no mental reservation, and with no\r\npurpose to construe the Constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules.\r\nAnd while I do not choose now to specify particular acts of Congress as\r\nproper to be enforced, I do suggest that it will be much safer for all,\r\nboth in official and private stations, to conform to and abide by all\r\nthose acts which stand unrepealed, than to violate any of them, trusting\r\nto find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nIt is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President\r\nunder our National Constitution. During that period, fifteen different\r\nand greatly distinguished citizens have, in succession, administered the\r\nExecutive branch of the government. They have conducted it through many\r\nperils, and generally with great success. Yet, with all this scope for\r\nprecedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional\r\nterm of four years, under great and peculiar difficulty. A disruption of\r\nthe Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted.\r\n\r\nI hold that in contemplation of universal law, and of the Constitution,\r\nthe Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not\r\nexpressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments. It is\r\nsafe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its\r\norganic law for its own termination. Continue to execute all the\r\nexpress provisions of our National Government, and the Union will endure\r\nforever--it being impossible to destroy it, except by some action not\r\nprovided for in the instrument itself.\r\n\r\nAgain, if the United States be not a government proper, but an\r\nassociation of States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a\r\ncontract, be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?\r\nOne party to a contract may violate it--break it, so to speak; but does\r\nit not require all to lawfully rescind it?\r\n\r\nDescending from these general principles, we find the proposition that,\r\nin legal contemplation, the Union is perpetual, confirmed by the history\r\nof the Union itself. The Union is much older than the Constitution. It\r\nwas formed, in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774.\r\n\r\nIt was matured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776.\r\nIt was further matured, and the faith of all the then thirteen States\r\nexpressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the\r\nArticles of Confederation in 1778. And, finally, in 1787, one of the\r\ndeclared objects for ordaining and establishing the Constitution was \"to\r\nform a more perfect union.\"\r\n\r\nBut if destruction of the Union, by one, or by a part only, of the\r\nStates, be lawfully possible, the Union is less perfect than before, the\r\nConstitution having lost the vital element of perpetuity.\r\n\r\nIt follows, from these views, that no State, upon its own mere motion,\r\ncan lawfully get out of the Union; that resolves and ordinances to that\r\neffect are legally void; and that acts of violence within any State or\r\nStates, against the authority of the United States, are insurrectionary\r\nor revolutionary, according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nI therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws, the\r\nUnion is unbroken, and to the extent of my ability I shall take care, as\r\nthe Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of the\r\nUnion be faithfully executed in all the States. Doing this I deem to\r\nbe only a simple duty on my part; and I shall perform it, so far as\r\npracticable, unless my rightful masters, the American people, shall\r\nwithhold the requisite means, or, in some authoritative manner, direct\r\nthe contrary. I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as\r\nthe declared purpose of the Union that it will constitutionally defend\r\nand maintain itself. In doing this there need be no blood-shed or\r\nviolence; and there shall be none, unless it be forced upon the National\r\nauthority. The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and\r\npossess the property and places belonging to the government, and to\r\ncollect the duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for\r\nthese objects, there will be no invasion, no using of force against or\r\namong the people anywhere. Where hostility to the United States, in\r\nany interior locality, shall be so great and universal as to prevent\r\ncompetent resident citizens from holding the Federal offices, there will\r\nbe no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that\r\nobject. While the strict legal right may exist in the government to\r\nenforce the exercise of these offices, the attempt to do so would be so\r\nirritating, and so nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it better to\r\nforego, for the time, the uses of such offices.\r\n\r\nThe mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts\r\nof the Union. So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that\r\nsense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and\r\nreflection. The course here indicated will be followed, unless current\r\nevents and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper,\r\nand in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised,\r\naccording to circumstances actually existing, and with a view and a hope\r\nof a peaceful solution of the National troubles, and the restoration of\r\nfraternal sympathies and affections.\r\n\r\nThat there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy\r\nthe Union at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will\r\nneither affirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word to\r\nthem. To those, however, who really love the Union, may I not speak?\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our\r\nNational fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes,\r\nwould it not be wise to ascertain why we do it? Will you hazard so\r\ndesperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the\r\ncertain ills you fly from have no real existence? Will you, while the\r\ncertain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly\r\nfrom,--will you risk the omission of so fearful a mistake?\r\n\r\nAll profess to be content in the Union, if all constitutional rights can\r\nbe maintained. Is it true, then, that any right, plainly written in the\r\nConstitution, has been denied? I think not. Happily the human mind is\r\nso constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this.\r\nThink, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written\r\nprovision of the Constitution has ever been denied. If, by the mere\r\nforce of numbers, a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly\r\nwritten constitutional right, it might, in a moral point of view,\r\njustify revolution--certainly would if such right were a vital one.\r\nBut such is not our case. All the vital rights of minorities and\r\nof individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and\r\nnegations, guaranties and prohibitions in the Constitution, that\r\ncontroversies never arise concerning them. But no organic law can ever\r\nbe framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question\r\nwhich may occur in practical administration. No foresight can\r\nanticipate, nor any document of reasonable length contain, express\r\nprovisions for all possible questions. Shall fugitives from labor be\r\nsurrendered by National or State authority? The Constitution does not\r\nexpressly say. May Congress prohibit slavery in the Territories? The\r\nConstitution does not expressly say. Must Congress protect slavery in\r\nthe Territories? The Constitution does not expressly say.\r\n\r\nFrom questions of this class spring all our constitutional\r\ncontroversies, and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities.\r\nIf the minority will not acquiesce, the majority must, or the government\r\nmust cease. There is no other alternative; for continuing the government\r\nis acquiescence on one side or the other. If a minority in such case\r\nwill secede rather than acquiesce, they make a precedent which, in turn,\r\nwill divide and ruin them; for a minority of their own will secede from\r\nthem whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such a minority.\r\nFor instance, why may not any portion of a new confederacy, a year\r\nor two hence, arbitrarily secede again, precisely as portions of the\r\npresent Union now claim to secede from it? All who cherish disunion\r\nsentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this.\r\n\r\nIs there such perfect identity of interests among the States to compose\r\na new Union, as to produce harmony only, and prevent renewed secession?\r\n\r\nPlainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy. A\r\nmajority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and\r\nalways changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and\r\nsentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people. Whoever rejects\r\nit, does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity is\r\nimpossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement, is wholly\r\ninadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle, anarchy or\r\ndespotism, in some form, is all that is left. * * *\r\n\r\nPhysically speaking, we cannot separate. We cannot remove our respective\r\nsections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them. A\r\nhusband and wife may be divorced, and go out of the presence and beyond\r\nthe reach of each other; but the different parts of our country cannot\r\ndo this. They cannot but remain face to face, and intercourse, either\r\namicable or hostile, must continue between them. It is impossible, then,\r\nto make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after\r\nseparation than before. Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can\r\nmake laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than\r\nlaws can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always,\r\nand when after much loss on both sides and no gain on either you cease\r\nfighting, the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are\r\nagain upon you.\r\n\r\nThis country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit\r\nit. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they\r\ncan exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or their\r\nrevolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it. I cannot be ignorant\r\nof the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of\r\nhaving the National Constitution amended. * * * I understand a proposed\r\namendment to the Constitution--which amendment, however, I have not\r\nseen--has passed Congress, to the effect that the Federal Government\r\nshall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the States,\r\nincluding that of persons held to service. To avoid misconstruction of\r\nwhat I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particular\r\namendments, so far as to say that, holding such a provision now to\r\nbe implied constitutional law, I have no objections to its being made\r\nexpress and irrevocable.'\r\n\r\nThe Chief Magistrate derives all his authority from the people, and\r\nthey have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the\r\nStates. The people themselves can do this also if they choose, but the\r\nExecutive, as such, has nothing to do with it. His duty is to administer\r\nthe present government as it came to his hands, and to transmit it,\r\nunimpaired by him, to his successor. Why should there not be a patient\r\nconfidence in the ultimate justice of the people? Is there any better\r\nor equal hope in the world? In our present differences is either party\r\nwithout faith of being in the right? If the Almighty Ruler of Nations,\r\nwith his eternal truth and justice, be on your side of the North, or\r\nyours of the South, that truth and that justice will surely prevail, by\r\nthe judgment of this great tribunal of the American people. By the frame\r\nof the Government under which we live, the same people have wisely given\r\ntheir public servants but little power for mischief, and have with equal\r\nwisdom provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very\r\nshort intervals. While the people retain their virtue and vigilance,\r\nno administration, by any extreme of wickedness or folly, can very\r\nseriously injure the government in the short space of four years.\r\n\r\nMy countrymen, one and all, think calmly and well upon this whole\r\nsubject. Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time. If there be an\r\nobject to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never\r\ntake deliberately, that object will be frustrated by taking time; but no\r\ngood object can be frustrated by it. Such of you as are now dissatisfied\r\nstill have the old Constitution unimpaired, and on the sensitive point,\r\nthe laws of your own framing under it; while the new Administration\r\nwill have no immediate power, if it would, to change either. If it\r\nwere admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in this\r\ndispute there is still no single good reason for precipitate action.\r\nIntelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance on Him who\r\nhas never yet forsaken this favored land are still competent to\r\nadjust in the best way all our present difficulty. In your hands, my\r\ndissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in mine, are the momentous\r\nissues of civil war. The government will not assail you. You can have\r\nno conflict without being yourselves the aggressors. You have no oath\r\nregistered in Heaven to destroy the government, while I shall have the\r\nmost solemn one to \"preserve, protect, and defend\" it.\r\n\r\nI am loth to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be\r\nenemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break, our\r\nbonds of affection. The mystic cords of memory, stretching from every\r\nbattle-field and patriot grave to every living heart and hearth-stone\r\nall over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union when\r\nagain touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFERSON DAVIS,\r\n\r\nOF MISSISSIPPI.' (BORN 1808, DIED 1889.)\r\n\r\nINAUGURAL ADDRESS, MONTGOMERY, ALA., FEBRUARY 18, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, FRIENDS,\r\nAND FELLOW-CITIZENS:\r\n\r\nOur present condition, achieved in a manner unprecedented in the history\r\nof nations, illustrates the American idea that governments rest upon the\r\nconsent of the governed, and that it is the right of the people to alter\r\nand abolish governments whenever they become destructive to the ends\r\nfor which they were established. The declared compact of the Union\r\nfrom which we have withdrawn was to establish justice, ensure domestic\r\ntranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general\r\nwelfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our\r\nposterity; and when in the judgment of the sovereign States now\r\ncomposing this Confederacy it has been perverted from the purposes for\r\nwhich it was ordained, and ceased to answer the ends for which it was\r\nestablished, a peaceful appeal to the ballot-box declared that, so far\r\nas they were concerned, the government created by that compact should\r\ncease to exist. In this they merely asserted the right which the\r\nDeclaration of Independence of 1776 defined to be inalienable. Of the\r\ntime and occasion of this exercise they as sovereigns were the final\r\njudges, each for himself. The impartial, enlightened verdict of mankind\r\nwill vindicate the rectitude of our conduct; and He who knows the hearts\r\nof men will judge of the sincerity with which we labored to preserve the\r\ngovernment of our fathers in its spirit.\r\n\r\nThe right solemnly proclaimed at the birth of the States, and which\r\nhas been affirmed and reaffirmed in the bills of rights of the States\r\nsubsequently admitted into the Union of 1789, undeniably recognizes in\r\nthe people the power to resume the authority delegated for the purposes\r\nof government. Thus the sovereign States here represented proceeded to\r\nform this Confederacy; and it is by the abuse of language that their act\r\nhas been denominated revolution. They formed a new alliance, but\r\nwithin each State its government has remained. The rights of person\r\nand property have not been disturbed. The agent through whom they\r\ncommunicated with foreign nations is changed, but this does not\r\nnecessarily interrupt their international relations. Sustained by the\r\nconsciousness that the transition from the former Union to the present\r\nConfederacy has not proceeded from a disregard on our part of our just\r\nobligations or any failure to perform every constitutional duty, moved\r\nby no interest or passion to invade the rights of others, anxious to\r\ncultivate peace and commerce with all nations, if we may not hope to\r\navoid war, we may at least expect that posterity will acquit us of\r\nhaving needlessly engaged in it. Doubly justified by the absence of\r\nwrong on our part, and by wanton aggression on the part of others, there\r\ncan be no use to doubt the courage and patriotism of the people of the\r\nConfederate States will be found equal to any measure of defence which\r\nsoon their security may require.\r\n\r\nAn agricultural people, whose chief interest is the export of a\r\ncommodity required in every manufacturing country, our true policy is\r\npeace and the freest trade which our necessities will permit. It is\r\nalike our interest and that of all those to whom we would sell and\r\nfrom whom we would buy, that there should be the fewest practicable\r\nrestrictions upon the interchange of commodities. There can be but\r\nlittle rivalry between ours and any manufacturing or navigating\r\ncommunity, such as the northeastern States of the American Union. It\r\nmust follow, therefore, that mutual interest would invite good-will and\r\nkind offices. If, however, passion or lust of dominion should cloud the\r\njudgment or inflame the ambition of those States, we must prepare to\r\nmeet the emergency, and maintain by the final arbitrament of the sword\r\nthe position which we have assumed among the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\nWe have entered upon a career of independence, and it must be inflexibly\r\npursued through many years of controversy with our late associates of\r\nthe Northern States. We have vainly endeavored to secure tranquillity\r\nand obtain respect for the rights to which we were entitled. As a\r\nnecessity, not a choice, we have resorted to the remedy of separation,\r\nand henceforth our energies must be directed to the conduct of our own\r\naffairs, and the perpetuity of the Confederacy which we have formed. If\r\na just perception of mutual interest shall permit us peaceably to pursue\r\nour separate political career, my most earnest desire will have been\r\nfulfilled. But if this be denied us, and the integrity of our territory\r\nand jurisdiction be assailed, it will but remain for us with firm\r\nresolve to appeal to arms and invoke the blessing of Providence on a\r\njust cause. * * *\r\n\r\nActuated solely by a desire to preserve our own rights, and to promote\r\nour own welfare, the separation of the Confederate States has been\r\nmarked by no aggression upon others, and followed by no domestic\r\nconvulsion. Our industrial pursuits have received no check, the\r\ncultivation of our fields progresses as heretofore, and even should we\r\nbe involved in war, there would be no considerable diminution in the\r\nproduction of the staples which have constituted our exports, in which\r\nthe commercial world has an interest scarcely less than our own. This\r\ncommon interest of producer and consumer can only be intercepted by\r\nan exterior force which should obstruct its transmission to foreign\r\nmarkets, a course of conduct which would be detrimental to manufacturing\r\nand commercial interests abroad.\r\n\r\nShould reason guide the action of the government from which we have\r\nseparated, a policy so detrimental to the civilized world, the Northern\r\nStates included, could not be dictated by even a stronger desire\r\nto inflict injury upon us; but if it be otherwise, a terrible\r\nresponsibility will rest upon it, and the suffering of millions will\r\nbear testimony to the folly and wickedness of our aggressors. In the\r\nmeantime there will remain to us, besides the ordinary remedies before\r\nsuggested, the well-known resources for retaliation upon the commerce of\r\nan enemy. * * * We have changed the constituent parts but not the system\r\nof our government. The Constitution formed by our fathers is that of\r\nthese Confederate States. In their exposition of it, and in the judicial\r\nconstruction it has received, we have a light which reveals its\r\ntrue meaning. Thus instructed as to the just interpretation of that\r\ninstrument, and ever remembering that all offices are but trusts held\r\nfor the people, and that delegated powers are to be strictly construed,\r\nI will hope by due diligence in the performance of my duties, though I\r\nmay disappoint your expectation, yet to retain, when retiring, something\r\nof the good-will and confidence which will welcome my entrance into\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nIt is joyous in the midst of perilous times to look around upon a people\r\nunited in heart, when one purpose of high resolve animates and actuates\r\nthe whole, where the sacrifices to be made are not weighed in the\r\nbalance, against honor, right, liberty, and equality. Obstacles may\r\nretard, but they cannot long prevent, the progress of a movement\r\nsanctioned by its justice and sustained by a virtuous people. Reverently\r\nlet us invoke the God of our fathers to guide and protect us in our\r\nefforts to perpetuate the principles which by His blessing they were\r\nable to vindicate, establish, and transmit to their posterity; and\r\nwith a continuance of His favor, ever gratefully acknowledged, we may\r\nhopefully look forward to success, to peace, to prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER HAMILTON STEPHENS,\r\n\r\nOF GEORGIA. (BORN 1812, DIED 1884.)\r\n\r\nTHE \"CORNER-STONE\" ADDRESS;\r\n\r\nATHENAEUM, SAVANNAH, GA., MARCH 21, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. MAYOR AND GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nWe are in the midst of one of the greatest epochs in our history. The\r\nlast ninety days will mark one of the most interesting eras in the\r\nhistory of modern civilization. Seven States have in the last three\r\nmonths thrown off an old government and formed a new. This revolution\r\nhas been signally marked, up to this time, by the fact of its having\r\nbeen accomplished without the loss of a single drop of blood. This new\r\nconstitution, or form of government, constitutes the subject to which\r\nyour attention will be partly invited.\r\n\r\nIn reference to it, I make this first general remark: it amply secures\r\nall our ancient rights, franchises, and liberties. All the great\r\nprinciples of Magna Charta are retained in it. No citizen is deprived of\r\nlife, liberty, or property, but by the judgment of his peers under the\r\nlaws of the land. The great principle of religious liberty, which was\r\nthe honor and pride of the old Constitution, is still maintained and\r\nsecured. All the essentials of the old Constitution, which have endeared\r\nit to the hearts of the American people, have been preserved and\r\nperpetuated. Some changes have been made. Some of these I should prefer\r\nnot to have seen made; but other important changes do meet my cordial\r\napprobation. They form great improvements upon the old Constitution. So,\r\ntaking the whole new constitution, I have no hesitancy in giving it as\r\nmy judgment that it is decidedly better than the old.\r\n\r\nAllow me briefly to allude to some of these improvements. The question\r\nof building up class interests, or fostering one branch of industry to\r\nthe prejudice of another under the exercise of the revenue power, which\r\ngave us so much trouble under the old Constitution, is put at rest\r\nforever under the new. We allow the imposition of no duty with a view of\r\ngiving advantage to one class of persons, in any trade or business,\r\nover those of another. All, under our system, stand upon the same broad\r\nprinciples of perfect equality. Honest labor and enterprise are left\r\nfree and unrestricted in whatever pursuit they may be engaged. This old\r\nthorn of the tariff, which was the cause of so much irritation in the\r\nold body politic, is removed forever from the new.\r\n\r\nAgain, the subject of internal improvements, under the power of Congress\r\nto regulate commerce, is put at rest under our system. The power,\r\nclaimed by construction under the old Constitution, was at least a\r\ndoubtful one; it rested solely upon construction. We of the South,\r\ngenerally apart from considerations of constitutional principles,\r\nopposed its exercise upon grounds of its inexpediency and injustice. *\r\n* * Our opposition sprang from no hostility to commerce, or to all\r\nnecessary aids for facilitating it. With us it was simply a question\r\nupon whom the burden should fall. In Georgia, for instance, we have done\r\nas much for the cause of internal improvements as any other portion of\r\nthe country, according to population and means. We have stretched out\r\nlines of railroad from the seaboard to the mountains; dug down the\r\nhills, and filled up the valleys, at a cost of $25,000,000. * * * No\r\nState was in greater need of such facilities than Georgia, but we did\r\nnot ask that these works should be made by appropriations out of the\r\ncommon treasury. The cost of the grading, the superstructure, and the\r\nequipment of our roads was borne by those who had entered into the\r\nenterprise. Nay, more, not only the cost of the iron--no small item in\r\nthe general cost--was borne in the same way, but we were compelled\r\nto pay into the common treasury several millions of dollars for the\r\nprivilege of importing the iron, after the price was paid for it abroad.\r\nWhat justice was there in taking this money, which our people paid into\r\nthe common treasury on the importation of our iron, and applying it to\r\nthe improvement of rivers and harbors elsewhere? The true principle is\r\nto subject the commerce of every locality to whatever burdens may be\r\nnecessary to facilitate it. If Charleston harbor needs improvement, let\r\nthe commerce of Charleston bear the burden. * * * This, again, is the\r\nbroad principle of perfect equality and justice; and it is especially\r\nset forth and established in our new constitution.\r\n\r\nAnother feature to which I will allude is that the new constitution\r\nprovides that cabinet ministers and heads of departments may have\r\nthe privilege of seats upon the floor of the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives, may have the right to participate in the debates and\r\ndiscussions upon the various subjects of administration. I should have\r\npreferred that this provision should have gone further, and required\r\nthe President to select his constitutional advisers from the Senate\r\nand House of Representatives. That would have conformed entirely to the\r\npractice in the British Parliament, which, in my judgment, is one of the\r\nwisest provisions in the British constitution. It is the only feature\r\nthat saves that government. It is that which gives it stability in\r\nits facility to change its administration. Ours, as it is, is a great\r\napproximation to the right principle. * * *\r\n\r\nAnother change in the Constitution relates to the length of the tenure\r\nof the Presidential office. In the new constitution it is six years\r\ninstead of four, and the President is rendered ineligible for a\r\nre-election. This is certainly a decidedly conservative change. It will\r\nremove from the incumbent all temptation to use his office or exert the\r\npowers confided to him for any objects of personal ambition. The only\r\nincentive to that higher ambition which should move and actuate one\r\nholding such high trusts in his hands will be the good of the people,\r\nthe advancement, happiness, safety, honor, and true glory of the\r\nConfederacy.\r\n\r\nBut, not to be tedious in enumerating the numerous changes for the\r\nbetter, allow me to allude to one other--though last, not least. The\r\nnew constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions\r\nrelating to our peculiar institution, African slavery as it exists\r\namongst us, the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization.\r\nThis was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution.\r\nJefferson, in his forecast, had anticipated this as the \"rock upon which\r\nthe old Union would split.\" He was right. What was conjecture with him\r\nis now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great\r\ntruth upon which that rock stood and stands may be doubted. The\r\nprevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen\r\nat the time of the formation of the old Constitution were that the\r\nenslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that\r\nit was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and politically. It was an\r\nevil they knew not well how to deal with; but the general opinion of the\r\nmen of that day was that, somehow or other, in the order of Providence,\r\nthe institution would be evanescent and pass away. This idea, though not\r\nincorporated in the Constitution, was the prevailing idea at that time.\r\nThe Constitution, it is true, secured every essential guarantee to the\r\ninstitution while it should last, and hence no argument can be justly\r\nurged against the constitutional guaranties thus secured, because of the\r\ncommon sentiment of the day. Those ideas, however, were fundamentally\r\nwrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This\r\nwas an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the government built upon\r\nit fell when \"the storm came and the wind blew.\"\r\n\r\nOur new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its\r\nfoundations are laid, its corner-stone rests, upon the great truth that\r\nthe negro is not equal to the white man, that slavery--subordination to\r\nthe superior race--is his natural and normal condition.\r\n\r\nThis, our new government, is the first in the history of the world based\r\nupon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth. This truth has\r\nbeen slow in the process of its development, like all other truths in\r\nthe various departments of science. It has been so even amongst us.\r\nMany who hear me, perhaps, can recollect well that this truth was\r\nnot generally admitted, even within their day. The errors of the past\r\ngeneration still clung to many as late as twenty years ago. Those at the\r\nNorth who still cling to these errors, with a zeal above knowledge, we\r\njustly denominate fanatics. All fanaticism springs from an aberration of\r\nthe mind, from a defect in reasoning. It is a species of insanity. One\r\nof the most striking characteristics of insanity, in many instances, is\r\nforming correct conclusions from fancied or erroneous premises. So with\r\nthe antislavery fanatics; their conclusions are right, if their premises\r\nwere. They assume that the negro is equal, and hence conclude that he\r\nis entitled to equal rights and privileges with the white man. If their\r\npremises were correct, their conclusions would be logical and just; but,\r\ntheir premise being wrong, their whole argument fails. I recollect once\r\nhearing a gentleman from one of the Northern States, of great power and\r\nability, announce in the House of Representatives, with imposing effect,\r\nthat we of the South would be compelled ultimately to yield upon this\r\nsubject of slavery, that it was as impossible to war successfully\r\nagainst a principle in politics as it was in physics or mechanics; that\r\nthe principle would ultimately prevail; that we, in maintaining slavery\r\nas it exists with us, were warring against a principle, founded in\r\nnature, the principle of the equality of men. The reply I made to him\r\nwas that upon his own grounds we should ultimately succeed, and that\r\nhe and his associates in this crusade against our institutions would\r\nultimately fail. The truth announced, that it was as impossible to war\r\nsuccessfully against a principle in politics as it was in physics and\r\nmechanics, I admitted; but told him that it was he, and those acting\r\nwith him, who were warring against a principle. They were attempting to\r\nmake things equal which the Creator had made unequal.\r\n\r\nIn the conflict, thus far, success has been on our side, complete\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of the Confederate States. It is\r\nupon this, as I have stated, our social fabric is firmly planted; and I\r\ncannot permit myself to doubt the ultimate success of a full recognition\r\nof this principle throughout the civilized and enlightened world.\r\n\r\nAs I have stated, the truth of this principle may be slow in\r\ndevelopment, as all truths are and ever have been, in the various\r\nbranches of science. It was so with the principles announced by Galileo.\r\nIt was so with Adam Smith and his principles of political economy. It\r\nwas so with Harvey and his theory of the circulation of the blood; it\r\nis stated that not a single one of the medical profession, living at the\r\ntime of the announcement of the truths made by him, admitted them. Now\r\nthey are universally acknowledged. May we not, therefore, look with\r\nconfidence to the ultimate universal acknowledgment of the truths upon\r\nwhich our system rests? It is the first government ever instituted upon\r\nthe principles in strict conformity to nature and the ordination\r\nof Providence in furnishing the materials of human society. Many\r\ngovernments have been founded upon the principle of the subordination\r\nand serfdom of certain classes of the same race; such were and are in\r\nviolation of the laws of nature. Our system commits no such violation of\r\nnature's laws. With us, all the white race, however high or low, rich\r\nor poor, are equal in the eye of the law. Not so with the negro;\r\nsubordination is his place. He, by nature or by the curse against\r\nCanaan, is fitted for that condition which he occupies in our system.\r\nThe architect, in the construction of buildings, lays the foundation\r\nwith the proper material--the granite; then comes the brick or the\r\nmarble. The substratum of our society is made of the material fitted by\r\nnature for it; and by experience we know that it is best not only for\r\nthe superior race, but for the inferior race, that it should be so. It\r\nis, indeed, in conformity with the ordinance of the Creator. It is not\r\nfor us to inquire into the wisdom of His ordinances, or to question\r\nthem. For His own purposes He has made one race to differ from another,\r\nas He has made \"one star to differ from another star in glory.\" The\r\ngreat objects of humanity are best attained when there is conformity to\r\nHis laws and decrees, in the formation of governments as well as in\r\nall things else. Our Confederacy is founded upon principles in strict\r\nconformity with these views. This stone, which was rejected by the first\r\nbuilders, \"is become the chief of the corner,\" the real \"corner-stone\"\r\nin our new edifice. * * *\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson said in his inaugural, in 1801, after the heated contest\r\npreceding his election, that there might be differences of opinion\r\nwithout differences of principle, and that all, to some extent, had\r\nbeen Federalists, and all Republicans. So it may now be said of us\r\nthat, whatever differences of opinion as to the best policy in having\r\na cooperation with our border sister slave States, if the worst came\r\nto the worst, as we were all cooperationists, we are all now for\r\nindependence, whether they come or not. * * *\r\n\r\nWe are a young republic, just entering upon the arena of nations;\r\nwe will be the architects of our own fortunes. Our destiny,\r\nunder Providence, is in our own hands. With wisdom, prudence, and\r\nstatesmanship on the part of our public men, and intelligence, virtue,\r\nand patriotism on the part of the people, success to the full measure\r\nof our most sanguine hopes may be looked for. But, if unwise counsels\r\nprevail, if we become divided, if schisms arise, if dissensions spring\r\nup, if factions are engendered, if party spirit, nourished by unholy\r\npersonal ambition, shall rear its hydra head, I have no good to prophesy\r\nfor you. Without intelligence, virtue, integrity, and patriotism on\r\nthe part of the people, no republic or representative government can be\r\ndurable or stable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN C. BRECKENRIDGE, and EDWARD D. BAKER\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN C. BRECKENRIDGE, OF KENTUCKY, (BORN 1825, DIED 1875),\r\n\r\nEDWARD D. BAKER, OF OREGON, (BORN 1811, DIED 1861)\r\n\r\nON SUPPRESSION OF INSURRECTION,\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATE, AUGUST I, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BRECKENRIDGE. I do not know how the Senate may vote upon this\r\nquestion; and I have heard some remarks which have dropped from certain\r\nSenators which have struck me with so much surprise, that I desire to\r\nsay a few words in reply to them now.\r\n\r\nThis drama, sir, is beginning to open before us, and we begin to\r\ncatch some idea of its magnitude. Appalled by the extent of it, and\r\nembarrassed by what they see before them and around them, the Senators\r\nwho are themselves the most vehement in urging on this course of events,\r\nare beginning to quarrel among themselves as to the precise way in which\r\nto regulate it.\r\n\r\nThe Senator from Vermont objects to this bill because it puts a\r\nlimitation on what he considers already existing powers on the part of\r\nthe President. I wish to say a few words presently in regard to some\r\nprovisions of this bill, and then the Senate and the country may judge\r\nof the extent of those powers of which this bill is a limitation.\r\n\r\nI endeavored, Mr. President, to demonstrate a short time ago, that the\r\nwhole tendency of our proceedings was to trample the Constitution under\r\nour feet, and to conduct this contest without the slightest regard to\r\nits provisions. Everything that has occurred since, demonstrates that\r\nthe view I took of the conduct and tendency of public affairs was\r\ncorrect. Already both Houses of Congress have passed a bill virtually to\r\nconfiscate all the property in the States that have withdrawn, declaring\r\nin the bill to which I refer that all property of every description\r\nemployed in any way to promote or aid in the insurrection, as it is\r\ndenominated, shall be forfeited and confiscated. I need not say to\r\nyou, sir, that all property of every kind is employed in those States,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, in aid of the contest they are waging, and\r\nconsequently that bill is a general confiscation of all property there.\r\n\r\nAs if afraid, however, that this general term might not apply to slave\r\nproperty, it adds an additional section. Although they were covered by\r\nthe first section of the bill, to make sure of that, however, it adds\r\nanother section, declaring that all persons held to service or labor;\r\nwho shall be employed in any way to aid or promote the contest now\r\nwaging, shall be discharged from such service and become free: Nothing\r\ncan be more apparent than that that is a general act of emancipation;\r\nbecause all the slaves in that country are employed in furnishing the\r\nmeans of subsistence and life to those who are prosecuting the contest;\r\nand it is an indirect, but perfectly certain mode of carrying out the\r\npurposes contained in the bill introduced by the Senator from Kansas\r\n(Mr. Pomeroy). It is doing under cover and by indirection, but\r\ncertainly, what he proposes shall be done by direct proclamation of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nAgain, sir: to show that all these proceedings are characterized by an\r\nutter disregard of the Federal Constitution, what is happening around us\r\nevery day? In the State of New York, some young man has been imprisoned\r\nby executive authority upon no distinct charge, and the military officer\r\nhaving him in charge refused to obey the writ of _habeas corpus_ issued\r\nby a judge. What is the color of excuse for that action in the State\r\nof New York? As a Senator said, is New York in resistance to the\r\nGovernment? Is there any danger to the stability of the Government\r\nthere? Then, sir, what reason will any Senator rise and give on this\r\nfloor for the refusal to give to the civil authorities the body of a man\r\ntaken by a military commander in the State of New York?\r\n\r\nAgain: the police commissioners of Baltimore were arrested by military\r\nauthority without any charges whatever. In vain they have asked for\r\na specification. In vain they have sent a respectful protest to the\r\nCongress of the United States. In vain the House of Representatives, by\r\nresolution, requested the President to furnish the representatives of\r\nthe people with the grounds of their arrest. He answers the House of\r\nRepresentatives that, in his judgment, the public interest does not\r\npermit him to say why they were arrested, on what charges, or what he\r\nhas done with them--and you call this liberty and law and proceedings\r\nfor the preservation of the Constitution! They have been spirited off\r\nfrom one fortress to another, their locality unknown, and the President\r\nof the United States refuses, upon the application of the most numerous\r\nbranch of the national Legislature, to furnish them with the grounds of\r\ntheir arrest, or to inform them what he has done with them.\r\n\r\nSir, it was said the other day by the Senator from Illinois (Mr.\r\nBrowning) that I had assailed the conduct of the Executive with\r\nvehemence, if not with malignity. I am not aware that I have done so.\r\nI criticised, with the freedom that belongs to the representative of a\r\nsovereign State and the people, the conduct of the Executive. I shall\r\ncontinue to do so as long as I hold a seat upon this floor, when, in my\r\nopinion, that conduct deserves criticism. Sir, I need not say that, in\r\nthe midst of such events as surround us, I could not cherish personal\r\nanimosity towards any human being. Towards that distinguished officer, I\r\nnever did cherish it. Upon the contrary, I think more highly of him,\r\nas a man and an officer, than I do of many who are around him and who,\r\nperhaps guide his counsels. I deem him to be personally an honest man,\r\nand I believe that he is trampling upon the Constitution of his country\r\nevery day, with probably good motives, under the counsels of those who\r\ninfluence him. But, sir, I have nothing now to say about the President.\r\nThe proceedings of Congress have eclipsed the actions of the Executive;\r\nand if this bill shall become a law, the proceedings of the President\r\nwill sink into absolute nothingness in the presence of the outrages upon\r\npersonal and public liberty which have been perpetrated by the Congress\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMr. President, gentlemen talk about the Union as if it was an end\r\ninstead of a means. They talk about it as if it was the Union of these\r\nStates which alone had brought into life the principles of public and\r\nof personal liberty. Sir, they existed before, and they may survive it.\r\nTake care that in pursuing one idea you you do not destroy not only\r\nthe Constitution of your country, but sever what remains of the Federal\r\nUnion. These eternal and sacred principles of public men and of personal\r\nliberty, which lived before the Union and will live forever and ever\r\nsomewhere, must be respected; they cannot with impunity be overthrown;\r\nand if you force the people to the issue between any form of government\r\nand these priceless principles, that form of government will perish;\r\nthey will tear it asunder as the irrepressible forces of nature rend\r\nwhatever opposes them.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I shall not long detain the Senate. I shall not enter\r\nnow upon an elaborate discussion of all the principles involved in this\r\nbill, and all the consequences which, in my opinion, flow from it. A\r\nword in regard to what fell from the Senator from Vermont, the substance\r\nof which has been uttered by a great many Senators on this floor. What I\r\ntried to show some time ago has been substantially admitted. One Senator\r\nsays that the Constitution is put aside in a struggle like this. Another\r\nSenator says that the condition of affairs is altogether abnormal, and\r\nthat you cannot deal with them on constitutional principles, any more\r\nthan you can deal, by any of the regular operations of the laws of\r\nnature, with an earthquake. The Senator from Vermont says that all these\r\nproceedings are to be conducted according to the laws of war; and he\r\nadds that the laws of war require many things to be done which are\r\nabsolutely forbidden in the Constitution; which Congress is prohibited\r\nfrom doing, and all other departments of the Government are forbidden\r\nfrom doing by the Constitution; but that they are proper under the laws\r\nof war, which must alone be the measure of our action now. I desire the\r\ncountry, then, to know this fact; that it is openly avowed upon this\r\nfloor that constitutional limitations are no longer to be regarded;\r\nbut that you are acting just as if there were two nations upon this\r\ncontinent, one arrayed against the other; some eighteen or twenty\r\nmillion on one side, and some ten or twelve million on the other, as to\r\nwhom the Constitution is nought, and the laws of war alone apply.\r\n\r\nSir, let the people, already beginning to pause and reflect upon the\r\norigin and nature and the probable consequences of this unhappy strife,\r\nget this idea fairly lodged in their minds--and it is a true one--and\r\nI will venture to say that the brave words which we now hear every\r\nday about crushing, subjugating, treason, and traitors, will not be\r\nso uttered the next time the Representatives of the people and States\r\nassemble beneath the dome of this Capitol.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMr. President, we are on the wrong tack; we have been from the\r\nbeginning. The people begin to see it. Here we have been hurling gallant\r\nfellows on to death, and the blood of Americans has been shed--for what?\r\nThey have shown their prowess, respectively--that which belongs to\r\nthe race--and shown it like men. But for what have the United States\r\nsoldiers, according to the exposition we have heard here to-day, been\r\nshedding their blood, and displaying their dauntless courage? It has\r\nbeen to carry out principles that three fourths of them abhor; for the\r\nprinciples contained in this bill, and continually avowed on the floor\r\nof the Senate, are not shared, I venture to say, by one fourth of the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nI have said, sir, that we are on the wrong tack. Nothing but ruin, utter\r\nruin, to the North, to the South, to the East, to the West, will follow\r\nthe prosecution of this contest. You may look forward to countless\r\ntreasures all spent for the purpose of desolating and ravaging this\r\ncontinent; at the end leaving us just where we are now; or if the forces\r\nof the United States are successful in ravaging the whole South, what on\r\nearth will be done with it after that is accomplished? Are not gentlemen\r\nnow perfectly satisfied that they have mistaken a people for a faction?\r\nAre they not perfectly satisfied that, to accomplish their object, it\r\nis necessary to subjugate, to conquer--aye, to exterminate--nearly ten\r\nmillions of people? Do you not know it? Does not everybody know it? Does\r\nnot the world know it? Let us pause, and let the Congress of the United\r\nStates respond to the rising feeling all over this land in favor of\r\npeace. War is separation; in the language of an eminent gentleman now\r\nno more, it is disunion, eternal and final disunion. We have separation\r\nnow; it is only made worse by war, and an utter extinction of all\r\nthose sentiments of common interest and feeling which might lead to\r\na political reunion founded upon consent and upon a conviction of its\r\nadvantages. Let the war go on, however, and soon, in addition to the\r\nmoans of widows and orphans all over this land, you will hear the cry of\r\ndistress from those who want food and the comforts of life. The people\r\nwill be unable to pay the grinding taxes which a fanatical spirit\r\nwill attempt to impose upon them. Nay, more, sir; you will see further\r\nseparation. I hope it is not \"the sunset of life gives me mystical\r\nlore,\" but in my mind's eye I plainly see \"coming events cast their\r\nshadows before.\" The Pacific slope now, doubtless, is devoted to the\r\nunion of States. Let this war go on till they find the burdens of\r\ntaxation greater than the burdens of a separate condition, and they will\r\nassert it. Let the war go on until they see the beautiful features\r\nof the old Confederacy beaten out of shape and comeliness by the\r\nbrutalizing hand of war, and they will turn aside in disgust from the\r\nsickening spectacle, and become a separate nation. Fight twelve months\r\nlonger, and the already opening differences that you see between New\r\nEngland and the great Northwest will develop themselves. You have two\r\nconfederacies now. Fight twelve months, and you will have three; twelve\r\nmonths longer, and you will have four.\r\n\r\nI will not enlarge upon it, sir. I am quite aware that all I say is\r\nreceived with a sneer of incredulity by the gentlemen who represent the\r\nfar Northeast; but let the future determine who was right and who was\r\nwrong. We are making our record here; I, my humble one, amid the\r\nsneers and aversion of nearly all who surround me, giving my votes,\r\nand uttering my utterances according to my convictions, with but few\r\napproving voices, and surrounded by scowls. The time will soon come,\r\nSenators, when history will put her final seal upon these proceedings,\r\nand if my name shall be recorded there, going along with yours as an\r\nactor in these scenes, I am willing to abide, fearlessly, her final\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BAKER.\r\n\r\nMr. President, it has not been my fortune to participate in at any\r\nlength, indeed, not to hear very much of, the discussion which has been\r\ngoing on--more, I think, in the hands of the Senator from Kentucky than\r\nanybody else--upon all the propositions connected with this war; and, as\r\nI really feel as sincerely as he can an earnest desire to preserve the\r\nConstitution of the United States for everybody, South as well as North,\r\nI have listened for some little time past to what he has said with\r\nan earnest desire to apprehend the point of his objection to this\r\nparticular bill. And now--waiving what I think is the elegant but loose\r\ndeclamation in which he chooses to indulge--I would propose, with\r\nmy habitual respect for him, (for nobody is more courteous and more\r\ngentlemanly,) to ask him if he will be kind enough to tell me what\r\nsingle particular provision there is in this bill which is in violation\r\nof the Constitution of the United States, which I have sworn to\r\nsupport--one distinct, single proposition in the bill.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BRECKENRIDGE. I will state, in general terms, that every one of them\r\nis, in my opinion, flagrantly so, unless it may be the last. I will send\r\nthe Senator the bill, and he may comment on the sections.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BAKER. Pick out that one which is in your judgment most clearly so.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BRECKENRIDGE. They are all, in my opinion, so equally atrocious that\r\nI dislike to discriminate. I will send the Senator the bill, and I tell\r\nhim that every section, except the last, in my opinion, violates the\r\nConstitution of the United States; and of that last section, I express\r\nno opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BAKER. I had hoped that that respectful suggestion to the Senator\r\nwould enable him to point out to me one, in his judgment, most clearly\r\nso, for they are not all alike--they are not equally atrocious.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BRECKENRIDGE. Very nearly. There are ten of them. The Senator can\r\nselect which he pleases.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BAKER. Let me try then, if I must generalize as the Senator does,\r\nto see if I can get the scope and meaning of this bill. It is a bill\r\nproviding that the President of the United States may declare, by\r\nproclamation, in a certain given state of fact, certain territory within\r\nthe United States to be in a condition of insurrection and war; which\r\nproclamation shall be extensively published within the district to\r\nwhich it relates. That is the first proposition. I ask him if that is\r\nunconstitutional? That is a plain question. Is it unconstitutional to\r\ngive power to the President to declare a portion of the territory of the\r\nUnited States in a state of insurrection or rebellion? He will not dare\r\nto say it is.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BRECKENRIDGE. Mr. President, the Senator from Oregon is a very\r\nadroit debater, and he discovers, of course, the great advantage he\r\nwould have if I were to allow him, occupying the floor, to ask me a\r\nseries of questions, and then have his own criticisms made on them.\r\nWhen he has closed his speech, if I deem it necessary, I will make some\r\nreply. At present, however, I will answer that question. The State of\r\nIllinois, I believe, is a military district; the State of Kentucky is a\r\nmilitary district. In my judgment, the President has no authority,\r\nand, in my judgment, Congress has no right to confer upon the President\r\nauthority, to declare a State in a condition of insurrection or\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BAKER. In the first place, the bill does not say a word about\r\nStates. That is the first answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BRECKENRIDGE. Does not the Senator know, in fact, that those States\r\ncompose military districts? It might as well have said \"States\" as to\r\ndescribe what is a State.\r\n\r\nMR. BAKER. I do; and that is the reason why I suggest to the honorable\r\nSenator that this criticism about States does not mean anything at all.\r\nThat is the very point. The objection certainly ought not to be that he\r\ncan declare a part of a State in insurrection and not the whole of\r\nit. In point of fact, the Constitution of the United States, and the\r\nCongress of the United States acting upon it, are not treating of\r\nStates, but of the territory comprising the United States; and I submit\r\nonce more to his better judgment that it cannot be unconstitutional to\r\nallow the President to declare a county or a part of a county, or a town\r\nor a part of a town, or part of a State, or the whole of a State, or\r\ntwo States, or five States, in a condition of insurrection, if in his\r\njudgment that be the fact. That is not wrong.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, it provides that that being so, the military\r\ncommander in that district may make and publish such police rules and\r\nregulations as he may deem necessary to suppress the rebellion and\r\nrestore order and preserve the lives and property of citizens. I submit\r\nto him, if the President of the United States has power, or ought to\r\nhave power, to suppress insurrection and rebellion, is there any better\r\nway to do it, or is there any other? The gentleman says, do it by the\r\ncivil power. Look at the fact. The civil power is utterly overwhelmed;\r\nthe courts are closed; the judges banished. Is the President not\r\nto execute the law? Is he to do it in person, or by his military\r\ncommanders? Are they to do it with regulation, or without it? That is\r\nthe only question.\r\n\r\nMr. President, the honorable Senator says there is a state of war. The\r\nSenator from Vermont agrees with him; or rather, he agrees with the\r\nSenator from Vermont in that. What then? There is a state of public war;\r\nnone the less war because it is urged from the other side; not the\r\nless war because it is unjust; not the less war because it is a war of\r\ninsurrection and rebellion. It is still war; and I am willing to say it\r\nis public war,--public as contra-distinguished from private war. What\r\nthen? Shall we carry that war on? Is it his duty as a Senator to carry\r\nit on? If so, how? By armies under command; by military organization\r\nand authority, advancing to suppress insurrection and rebellion. Is that\r\nwrong? Is that unconstitutional? Are we not bound to do, with whomever\r\nlevies war against us, as we would do if he were a foreigner? There\r\nis no distinction as to the mode of carrying on war; we carry on war\r\nagainst an advancing army just the same, whether it be from Russia or\r\nfrom South Carolina. Will the honorable Senator tell me it is our duty\r\nto stay here, within fifteen miles of the enemy seeking to advance\r\nupon us every hour, and talk about nice questions of constitutional\r\nconstruction as to whether it is war or merely insurrection? No, sir. It\r\nis our duty to advance, if we can; to suppress insurrection; to put down\r\nrebellion; to dissipate the rising; to scatter the enemy; and when we\r\nhave done so, to preserve, in the terms of the bill, the liberty, lives,\r\nand property of the people of the country, by just and fair police\r\nregulations. I ask the Senator from Indiana, (Mr. Lane,) when we took\r\nMonterey, did we not do it there?\r\n\r\nWhen we took Mexico, did we not do it there? Is it not a part, a\r\nnecessary, an indispensable part of war itself, that there shall be\r\nmilitary regulations over the country conquered and held? Is that\r\nunconstitutional?\r\n\r\nI think it was a mere play of words that the Senator indulged in when he\r\nattempted to answer the Senator from New York. I did not understand the\r\nSenator from New York to mean anything else substantially but this, that\r\nthe Constitution deals generally with a state of peace, and that\r\nwhen war is declared it leaves the condition of public affairs to be\r\ndetermined by the law of war, in the country where the war exists. It is\r\ntrue that the Constitution of the United States does adopt the laws of\r\nwar as a part of the instrument itself, during the continuance of\r\nwar. The Constitution does not provide that spies shall be hung. Is it\r\nunconstitutional to hang a spy? There is no provision for it in terms in\r\nthe Constitution; but nobody denies the right, the power, the justice.\r\nWhy? Because it is part of the law of war. The Constitution does not\r\nprovide for the exchange of prisoners; yet it may be done under the law\r\nof war. Indeed the Constitution does not provide that a prisoner may be\r\ntaken at all; yet his captivity is perfectly just and constitutional.\r\nIt seems to me that the Senator does not, will not take that view of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nAgain, sir, when a military commander advances, as I trust, if there are\r\nno more unexpected great reverses, he will advance, through Virginia\r\nand occupies the country, there, perhaps, as here, the civil law may\r\nbe silent; there perhaps the civil officers may flee as ours have been\r\ncompelled to flee. What then? If the civil law is silent, who shall\r\ncontrol and regulate the conquered district, who but the military\r\ncommander? As the Senator from Illinois has well said, shall it be done\r\nby regulation or without regulation? Shall the general, or the colonel,\r\nor the captain, be supreme, or shall he be regulated and ordered by the\r\nPresident of the United States? That is the sole question. The Senator\r\nhas put it well.\r\n\r\nI agree that we ought to do all we can to limit, to restrain, to fetter\r\nthe abuse of military power. Bayonets are at best illogical arguments. I\r\nam not willing, except as a case of sheerest necessity, ever to permit\r\na military commander to exercise authority over life, liberty, and\r\nproperty. But, sir, it is part of the law of war; you cannot carry\r\nin the rear of your army your courts; you cannot organize juries; you\r\ncannot have trials according to the forms and ceremonial of the\r\ncommon law amid the clangor of arms, and somebody must enforce police\r\nregulations in a conquered or occupied district. I ask the Senator from\r\nKentucky again respectfully, is that unconstitutional; or if in the\r\nnature of war it must exist, even if there be no law passed by us to\r\nallow it, is it unconstitutional to regulate it? That is the question,\r\nto which I do not think he will make a clear and distinct reply.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, I have shown him two sections of the bill, which I do not\r\nthink he will repeat earnestly are unconstitutional. I do not think that\r\nhe will seriously deny that it is perfectly constitutional to limit, to\r\nregulate, to control, at the same time to confer and restrain authority\r\nin the hands of military commanders. I think it is wise and judicious\r\nto regulate it by virtue of powers to be placed in the hands of the\r\nPresident by law.\r\n\r\nNow, a few words, and a few only, as to the Senator's predictions. The\r\nSenator from Kentucky stands up here in a manly way in opposition to\r\nwhat he sees is the overwhelming sentiment of the Senate, and utters\r\nreproof,malediction, and prediction combined. Well, sir, it is not every\r\nprediction that is prophecy. It is the easiest thing in the world to do;\r\nthere is nothing easier, except to be mistaken when we have predicted. I\r\nconfess, Mr. President, that I would not have predicted three weeks ago\r\nthe disasters which have overtaken our arms; and I do not think (if I\r\nwere to predict now) that six months hence the Senator will indulge in\r\nthe same tone of prediction which is his favorite key now. I would ask\r\nhim what would you have us do now--a confederate army within twenty\r\nmiles of us, advancing, or threatening to advance, to overwhelm your\r\nGovernment; to shake the pillars of the Union; to bring it around your\r\nhead, if you stay here, in ruins? Are we to stop and talk about an\r\nuprising sentiment in the North against the war? Are we to predict evil,\r\nand retire from what we predict? Is it not the manly part to go on as\r\nwe have begun, to raise money, and levy armies, to organize them, to\r\nprepare to advance; when we do advance, to regulate that advance by all\r\nthe laws and regulations that civilization and humanity will allow in\r\ntime of battle? Can we do anything more? To talk to us about stopping,\r\nis idle; we will never stop. Will the Senator yield to rebellion? Will\r\nhe shrink from armed insurrection? Will his State justify it? Will its\r\nbetter public opinion allow it? Shall we send a flag of truce? What\r\nwould he have? Or would he conduct this war so feebly, that the whole\r\nworld would smile at us in derision? What would he have? These speeches\r\nof his, sown broadcast over the land, what clear distinct meaning have\r\nthey? Are they not intended for disorganization in our very midst? Are\r\nthey not intended to dull our weapons? Are they not intended to destroy\r\nour zeal? Are they not intended to animate our enemies? Sir, are they\r\nnot words of brilliant, polished treason, even in the very Capitol of\r\nthe Confederacy? (Manifestations of applause in the galleries.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Presiding Officer (Mr. Anthony in the chair). Order!\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BAKER. What would have been thought if, in another Capitol, in\r\nanother Republic, in a yet more martial age, a senator as grave, not\r\nmore eloquent or dignified than the Senator from Kentucky, yet with\r\nthe Roman purple flowing over his shoulders, had risen in his place,\r\nsurrounded by all the illustrations of Roman glory, and declared that\r\nadvancing Hannibal was just, and that Carthage ought to be dealt with\r\nin terms of peace? What would have been thought if, after the battle of\r\nCanne, a senator there had risen in his place and denounced every levy\r\nof the Roman people, every expenditure of its treasure, and every appeal\r\nto the old recollections and the old glories? Sir, a Senator, himself\r\nlearned far more than myself in such lore (Mr. Fessenden), tells me, in\r\na voice that I am glad is audible, that he would have been hurled\r\nfrom the Tarpeian rock. It is a grand commentary upon the American\r\nConstitution that we permit these words to be uttered. I ask the Senator\r\nto recollect, too, what, save to send aid and comfort to the enemy, do\r\nthese predictions of his amount to? Every word thus uttered falls as a\r\nnote of inspiration upon every confederate ear. Every sound thus uttered\r\nis a word (and falling from his lips, a mighty word) of kindling and\r\ntriumph to a foe that determines to advance. For me, I have no such\r\nword as a Senator to utter. For me, amid temporary defeat, disaster,\r\ndisgrace, it seems that my duty calls me to utter another word, and that\r\nword is, bold, sudden, forward, determined war, according to the laws\r\nof war, by armies, by military commanders clothed with full power,\r\nadvancing with all the past glories of the Republic urging them to\r\nconquest.\r\n\r\nI do not stop to consider whether it is subjugation or not. It is\r\ncompulsory obedience, not to my will; not to yours, sir; not to the\r\nwill of any one man; not to the will of any one State; but compulsory\r\nobedience to the Constitution of the whole country. The Senator chose\r\nthe other day again and again to animadvert on a single expression in\r\na little speech which I delivered before the Senate, in which I took\r\noccasion to say that if the people of the rebellious States would not\r\ngovern themselves as States, they ought to be governed as Territories.\r\nThe Senator knew full well then, for I explained it twice--he knows full\r\nwell now--that on this side of the Chamber; nay, in this whole Chamber;\r\nnay, in this whole North and West; nay, in all the loyal States in all\r\ntheir breadth, there is not a man among us all who dreams of causing any\r\nman in the South to submit to any rule, either as to life, liberty, or\r\nproperty, that we ourselves do not willingly agree to yield to. Did\r\nhe ever think of that? Subjugation for what? When we subjugate South\r\nCarolina, what shall we do? We shall compel its obedience to the\r\nConstitution of the United States; that is all. Why play upon words?\r\nWe do not mean, we have never said, any more. If it be slavery that men\r\nshould obey the Constitution their fathers fought for, let it be so. If\r\nit be freedom, it is freedom equally for them and for us. We propose to\r\nsubjugate rebellion into loyalty; we propose to subjugate insurrection\r\ninto peace; we propose to subjugate confederate anarchy into\r\nconstitutional Union liberty. The Senator well knows that we propose\r\nno more. I ask him, I appeal to his better judgment now, what does he\r\nimagine we intend to do, if fortunately we conquer Tennessee or South\r\nCarolina--call it \"conquer,\" if you will, sir--what do we propose to\r\ndo? They will have their courts still; they will have their ballot-boxes\r\nstill; they will have their elections still; they will have their\r\nrepresentatives upon this floor still; they will have taxation and\r\nrepresentation still; they will have the writ of _habeas corpus_ still;\r\nthey will have every privilege they ever had and all we desire. When the\r\nconfederate armies are scattered; when their leaders are banished from\r\npower; when the people return to a late repentant sense of the wrong\r\nthey have done to a Government they never felt but in benignancy and\r\nblessing, then the Constitution made for all will be felt by all,\r\nlike the descending rains from heaven which bless all alike. Is that\r\nsubjugation? To restore what was, as it was, for the benefit of the\r\nwhole country and of the whole human race, is all we desire and all we\r\ncan have.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI tell the Senator that his predictions, sometimes for the South,\r\nsometimes for the Middle States, sometimes for the Northeast, and then\r\nwandering away in airy visions out to the far Pacific, about the dread\r\nof our people, as for loss of blood and treasure, provoking them to\r\ndisloyalty, are false in sentiment, false in fact, and false in loyalty.\r\nThe Senator from Kentucky is mistaken in them all. Five hundred million\r\ndollars! What then? Great Britain gave more than two thousand million\r\nin the great battle for constitutional liberty which she led at one time\r\nalmost single-handed against the world. Five hundred thousand men! What\r\nthen? We have them; they are ours; they are the children of the country.\r\nThey belong to the whole country; they are our sons; our kinsmen; and\r\nthere are many of us who will give them all up before we will abate one\r\nword of our just demand, or will retreat one inch from the line which\r\ndivides right from wrong.\r\n\r\nSir, it is not a question of men or of money in that sense. All the\r\nmoney, all the men, are, in our judgment, well bestowed in such a cause.\r\nWhen we give them, we know their value. Knowing their value well, we\r\ngive them with the more pride and the more joy. Sir, how can we retreat?\r\nSir, how can we make peace? Who shall treat? What commissioners? Who\r\nwould go? Upon what terms? Where is to be your boundary line? Where\r\nthe end of the principles we shall have to give up? What will become of\r\nconstitutional government? What will become of public liberty? What\r\nof past glories? What of future hopes? Shall we sink into the\r\ninsignificance of the grave--a degraded, defeated, emasculated people,\r\nfrightened by the results of one battle, and scared at the visions\r\nraised by the imagination of the Senator from Kentucky upon this floor?\r\nNo, sir; a thousand times, no, sir! We will rally--if, indeed, our words\r\nbe necessary--we will rally the people, the loyal people, of the whole\r\ncountry. They will pour forth their treasure, their money, their men,\r\nwithout stint, without measure. The most peaceable man in this body may\r\nstamp his foot upon this Senate-Chamber floor, as of old a warrior and\r\na senator did, and from that single stamp there will spring forth armed\r\nlegions. Shall one battle determine the fate of an empire? or, the loss\r\nof one thousand men or twenty thousand, or $100,000,000 or $500,000,000?\r\nIn a year's peace, in ten years, at most, of peaceful progress, we can\r\nrestore them all. There will be some graves reeking with blood, watered\r\nby the tears of affection. There will be some privation; there will\r\nbe some loss of luxury; there will be somewhat more need for labor to\r\nprocure the necessaries of life. When that is said, all is said. If we\r\nhave the country, the whole country, the Union, the Constitution,\r\nfree government--with these there will return all the blessings of\r\nwell-ordered civilization; the path of the country will be a career of\r\ngreatness and of glory such as, in the olden time, our fathers saw in\r\nthe dim visions of years yet to come, and such as would have been ours\r\nnow, to-day, if it had not been for the treason for which the Senator\r\ntoo often seeks to apologize.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BRECKENRIDGE. Mr. President, I have tried on more than one occasion\r\nin the Senate, in parliamentary and respectful language, to express my\r\nopinions in regard to the character of our Federal system, the relations\r\nof the States to the Federal Government, to the Constitution, the\r\nbond of the Federal political system. They differ utterly from those\r\nentertained by the Senator from Oregon. Evidently, by his line of\r\nargument, he regards this as an original, not a delegated Government,\r\nand he regards it as clothed with all those powers which belong to an\r\noriginal nation, not only with those powers which are delegated by the\r\ndifferent political communities that compose it, and limited by the\r\nwritten Constitution that forms the bond of Union. I have tried to\r\nshow that, in the view that I take of our Government, this war is\r\nan unconstitutional war. I do not think the Senator from Oregon has\r\nanswered my argument. He asks, what must we do? As we progress southward\r\nand invade the country, must we not, said he, carry with us all the laws\r\nof war? I would not progress southward and invade the country.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States, as I again repeat, in my judgment\r\nonly has the power to call out the military to assist the civil\r\nauthority in executing the laws; and when the question assumes the\r\nmagnitude and takes the form of a great political severance, and nearly\r\nhalf the members of the Confederacy withdraw themselves from it, what\r\nthen? I have never held that one State or a number of States have a\r\nright without cause to break the compact of the Constitution. But what I\r\nmean to say is that you cannot then undertake to make war in the name of\r\nthe Constitution. In my opinion they are out. You may conquer them; but\r\ndo not attempt to do it under what I consider false political pretenses.\r\nHowever, sir, I will not enlarge upon that. I have developed these ideas\r\nagain and again, and I do not care to re-argue them. Hence the Senator\r\nand I start from entirely different stand-points, and his pretended\r\nreplies are no replies at all.\r\n\r\nThe Senator asks me, \"What would you have us do?\" I have already\r\nintimated what I would have us do. I would have us stop the war. We\r\ncan do it. I have tried to show that there is none of that inexorable\r\nnecessity to continue this war which the Senator seems to suppose. I do\r\nnot hold that constitutional liberty on this continent is bound up in\r\nthis fratricidal, devastating, horrible contest. Upon the contrary, I\r\nfear it will find its grave in it. The Senator is mistaken in supposing\r\nthat we can reunite these States by war. He is mistaken in supposing\r\nthat eighteen or twenty million upon the one side can subjugate ten or\r\ntwelve million upon the other; or, if they do subjugate them, that you\r\ncan restore constitutional government as our fathers made it. You will\r\nhave to govern them as Territories, as suggested by the Senator, if\r\never they are reduced to the dominion of the United States, or, as the\r\nSenator from Vermont called them, \"those rebellious provinces of this\r\nUnion,\" in his speech to-day. Sir, I would prefer to see these States\r\nall reunited upon true constitutional principles to any other object\r\nthat could be offered me in life; and to restore, upon the principles\r\nof of our fathers, the Union of these States, to me the sacrifice of one\r\nunimportant life would be nothing; nothing, sir. But I infinitely prefer\r\nto see a peaceful separation of these States, than to see endless,\r\naimless, devastating war, at the end of which I see the grave of public\r\nliberty and of personal freedom.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEMENT L. VALLANDIGHAM,\r\n\r\nOF OHIO. (BORN 1820, DIED 1871.)\r\n\r\nON THE WAR AND ITS CONDUCT;\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, JANUARY 14, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR, I am one of that number who have opposed abolitionism, or the\r\npolitical development of the antislavery sentiment of the North and\r\nWest, from the beginning. In school, at college, at the bar, in public\r\nassemblies, in the Legislature, in Congress, boy and man, in time of\r\npeace and in time of war, at all times and at every sacrifice, I have\r\nfought against it. It cost me ten years' exclusion from office and honor\r\nat that period of life when honors are sweetest. No matter; I learned\r\nearly to do right and to wait. Sir, it is but the development of the\r\nspirit of intermeddling, whose children are strife and murder. Cain\r\ntroubled himself about the sacrifices of Abel, and slew his brother.\r\nMost of the wars, contentions, litigation, and bloodshed, from the\r\nbeginning of time, have been its fruits. The spirit of non-intervention\r\nis the very spirit of peace and concord. * * *\r\n\r\nThe spirit of intervention assumed the form of abolitionism because\r\nslavery was odious in name and by association to the Northern mind,\r\nand because it was that which most obviously marks the different\r\ncivilizations of the two sections. The South herself, in her early and\r\nlater efforts to rid herself of it, had exposed the weak and offensive\r\nparts of slavery to the world. Abolition intermeddling taught her\r\nat last to search for and defend the assumed social, economic, and\r\npolitical merit and values of the institution. But there never was an\r\nhour from the beginning when it did not seem to me as clear as the sun\r\nat broad noon that the agitation in any form in the North and West of\r\nthe slavery question must sooner or later end in disunion and civil war.\r\nThis was the opinion and prediction for years of Whig and Democratic\r\nstatesmen alike; and, after the unfortunate dissolution of the Whig\r\nparty in 1854, and the organization of the present Republican party upon\r\nthe exclusive antislavery and sectional basis, the event was inevitable,\r\nbecause, in the then existing temper of the public mind, and after\r\nthe education through the press and the pulpit, the lecture and the\r\npolitical canvass, for twenty years, of a generation taught to hate\r\nslavery and the South, the success of that party, possessed as it was\r\nof every engine of political, business, social, and religious influence,\r\nwas certain. It was only a question of time, and short time. Such\r\nwas its strength, indeed, that I do not believe that the union of the\r\nDemocratic party in 1860 on any candidate, even though he had been\r\nsupported also by the entire so-called conservative or anti-Lincoln vote\r\nof the country, would have availed to defeat it; and, if it had, the\r\nsuccess of the Abolition party would only have been postponed four years\r\nlonger. The disease had fastened too strongly upon the system to be\r\nhealed until it had run its course. The doctrine of \"the irrepressible\r\nconflict\" had been taught too long, and accepted too widely and\r\nearnestly, to die out until it should culminate in secession and\r\ndisunion, and, if coercion were resorted to, then in civil war. I\r\nbelieved from the first that it was the purpose of some of the apostles\r\nof that doctrine to force a collision between the North and the South,\r\neither to bring about a separation or to find a vain but bloody pretext\r\nfor abolishing slavery in the States. In any event, I knew, or thought I\r\nknew, that the end was certain collision and death to the Union.\r\n\r\nBelieving thus, I have for years past denounced those who taught that\r\ndoctrine, with all the vehemence, the bitterness, if you choose--I\r\nthought it a righteous, a patriotic bitterness--of an earnest and\r\nimpassioned nature. * * * But the people did not believe me, nor those\r\nolder and wiser and greater than I. They rejected the prophecy, and\r\nstoned the prophets. The candidate of the Republican party was chosen\r\nPresident. Secession began. Civil war was imminent. It was no petty\r\ninsurrection, no temporary combination to obstruct the execution of\r\nthe laws in certain States, but a revolution, systematic, deliberate,\r\ndetermined, and with the consent of a majority of the people of each\r\nState which seceded. Causeless it may have been, wicked it may have\r\nbeen, but there it was--not to be railed at, still less to be laughed\r\nat, but to be dealt with by statesmen as a fact. No display of vigor or\r\nforce alone, however sudden or great, could have arrested it even at the\r\noutset. It was disunion at last. The wolf had come, but civil war had\r\nnot yet followed. In my deliberate and solemn judgment there was but\r\none wise and masterly mode of dealing with it. Non-coercion would avert\r\ncivil war, and compromise crush out both abolitionism and secession. The\r\nparent and the child would thus both perish. But a resort to force would\r\nat once precipitate war, hasten secession, extend disunion, and while it\r\nlasted utterly cut off all hope of compromise. I believed that war, if\r\nlong enough continued, would be final, eternal disunion. I said it; I\r\nmeant it; and accordingly, to the utmost of my ability and influence, I\r\nexerted myself in behalf of the policy of non-coercion. It was adopted\r\nby Mr. Buchanan's administration, with the almost unanimous consent of\r\nthe Democratic and Constitutional Union parties in and out of Congress;\r\nand in February, with the consent of a majority of the Republican party\r\nin the Senate and the House. But that party most disastrously for the\r\ncountry refused all compromise. How, indeed, could they accept any? That\r\nwhich the South demanded, and the Democratic and Conservative parties of\r\nthe North and West were willing to grant, and which alone could avail to\r\nkeep the peace and save the Union, implied a surrender of the sole vital\r\nelement of the party and its platform, of the very principle, in fact,\r\nupon which it had just won the contest for the Presidency, not, indeed,\r\nby a majority of the popular vote--the majority was nearly a million\r\nagainst it,--but under the forms of the Constitution. Sir, the crime,\r\nthe \"high crime,\" of the Republican party was not so much its refusal\r\nto compromise, as its original organization upon a basis and doctrine\r\nwholly inconsistent with the stability of the Constitution and the peace\r\nof the Union.\r\n\r\nThe President-elect was inaugurated; and now, if only the policy of\r\nnon-coercion could be maintained, and war thus averted, time would do\r\nits work in the North and the South, and final peaceable adjustment\r\nand reunion be secured. Some time in March it was announced that the\r\nPresident had resolved to continue the policy of his predecessor, and\r\neven go a step farther, and evacuate Sumter and the other Federal forts\r\nand arsenals in the seceded States. His own party acquiesced; the whole\r\ncountry rejoiced. The policy of non-coercion had triumphed, and for\r\nonce, sir, in my life, I found myself in an immense majority. No man\r\nthen pretended that a Union founded in consent could be cemented by\r\nforce. Nay, more, the President and the Secretary of State went farther.\r\nSaid Mr. Seward, in an official diplomatic letter to Mr. Adams: \"For\r\nthese reasons, he (the President) would not be disposed to reject a\r\ncardinal dogma of theirs (the secessionists), namely, that the Federal\r\nGovernment could not reduce the seceding States to obedience by\r\nconquest, although he were disposed to question that proposition. But\r\nin fact the President willingly accepts it as true. Only an imperial\r\nor despotic government could subjugate thoroughly disaffected and\r\ninsurrectionary members of the State.\" * * * This Federal republican\r\nsystem of ours is, of all forms of government, the very one which is\r\nmost unfitted for such a labor. This, sir, was on the 10th of April, and\r\nyet on that very day the fleet was under sail for Charleston. The\r\npolicy of peace had been abandoned. Collision followed; the militia were\r\nordered out; civil war began.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, on the 14th of April, I believed that coercion would bring on\r\nwar, and war disunion. More than that, I believed what you all believe\r\nin your hearts to-day, that the South could never be conquered--never.\r\nAnd not that only, but I was satisfied--and you of the Abolition party\r\nhave now proved it to the world--that the secret but real purpose\r\nof the war was to abolish slavery in the State. * * * These were my\r\nconvictions on the 14th of April. Had I changed them on the 15th, when I\r\nread the President's proclamation, * * *\r\n\r\nI would have changed my public conduct also. But my convictions did not\r\nchange. I thought that, if war was disunion on the 14th of April, it was\r\nequally disunion on the 15th, and at all times. Believing this, I\r\ncould not, as an honest man, a Union man, and a patriot, lend an active\r\nsupport to the war; and I did not. I had rather my right arm were\r\nplucked from its socket and cast into eternal burnings, than, with\r\nmy convictions, to have thus defiled my soul with the guilt of moral\r\nperjury. Sir, I was not taught in that school which proclaims that \"all\r\nis fair in politics.\" I loathe, abhor, and detest the execrable maxim.\r\n* * * Perish office, perish honors, perish life itself; but do the thing\r\nthat is right, and do it like a man.\r\n\r\nCertainly, sir; I could not doubt what he must suffer who dare defy the\r\nopinions and the passions, not to say the madness, of twenty millions of\r\npeople. * * * I did not support the war; and to-day I bless God that not\r\nthe smell of so much as one drop of its blood is upon my garments. Sir,\r\nI censure no brave man who rushed patriotically into this war; neither\r\nwill I quarrel with any one, here or elsewhere, who gave to it an honest\r\nsupport. Had their convictions been mine, I, too, would doubtless\r\nhave done as they did. With my convictions I could not. But I was a\r\nRepresentative. War existed--by whose act no matter--not by mine. The\r\nPresident, the Senate, the House, and the country all said that there\r\nshould be war. * * * I belonged to that school of politics which teaches\r\nthat, when we are at war, the government--I do not mean the Executive\r\nalone, but the government--is entitled to demand and have, without\r\nresistance, such number of men, and such amount of money and supplies\r\ngenerally, as may be necessary for the war, until an appeal can be had\r\nto the people. Before that tribunal alone, in the first instance,\r\nmust the question of the continuance of the war be tried. This was Mr.\r\nCalhoun's opinion * * * in the Mexican war. Speaking of that war in\r\n1847, he said: \"Every Senator knows that I was opposed to the war; but\r\nnone but myself knows the depth of that opposition. With my conception\r\nof its character and consequences, it was impossible for me to vote for\r\nit. * * * But, after war was declared, by authority of the government,\r\nI acquiesced in what I could not prevent, and what it was impossible for\r\nme to arrest; and I then felt it to be my duty to limit my efforts to\r\ngive such direction to the war as would, as far as possible, prevent\r\nthe evils and dangers with which it threatened the country and its\r\ninstitutions.\"\r\n\r\nSir, I adopt all this as my position and my defence, though, perhaps, in\r\na civil war, I might fairly go farther in opposition. I could not, with\r\nmy convictions, vote men and money for this war, and I would not, as a\r\nRepresentative, vote against them. I meant that, without opposition, the\r\nPresident might take all the men and all the money he should demand, and\r\nthen to hold him to a strict responsibility before the people for the\r\nresults. Not believing the soldiers responsible for the war or its\r\npurposes or its consequences, I have never withheld my vote where\r\ntheir separate interests were concerned. But I have denounced from the\r\nbeginning the usurpations and the infractions, one and all, of law and\r\nconstitution, by the President and those under him; their repeated and\r\npersistent arbitrary arrests, the suspension of _habeas corpus_, the\r\nviolation of freedom of the mails, of the private house, of the press,\r\nand of speech, and all the other multiplied wrongs and outrages upon\r\npublic liberty and private right, which have made this country one of\r\nthe worst despotisms on earth for the past twenty months, and I will\r\ncontinue to rebuke and denounce them to the end; and the people, thank\r\nGod, have at last heard and heeded, and rebuked them too. To the record\r\nand to time I appeal again for my justification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY WARD BEECHER,\r\n\r\nOF NEW YORK. (BORN 1813, DIED 1887.)\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT LIVERPOOL, OCTOBER 16, 1863\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more than twenty-five years I have been made perfectly familiar with\r\npopular assemblies in all parts of my country except the extreme South.\r\nThere has not for the whole of that time been a single day of my life\r\nwhen it would have been safe for me to go South of Mason's and Dixon's\r\nline in my own country, and all for one reason: my solemn, earnest,\r\npersistent testimony against that which I consider to be the most\r\natrocious thing under the sun--the system of American slavery in a great\r\nfree republic. [Cheers.] I have passed through that early period when\r\nright of free speech was denied to me. Again and again I have attempted\r\nto address audiences that, for no other crime than that of free speech,\r\nvisited me with all manner of contumelious epithets; and now since I\r\nhave been in England, although I have met with greater kindness and\r\ncourtesy on the part of most than I deserved, yet, on the other hand, I\r\nperceive that the Southern influence prevails to some extent in England.\r\n[Applause and uproar.] It is my old acquaintance; I understand it\r\nperfectly--[laughter]--and I have always held it to be an unfailing\r\ntruth that where a man had a cause that would bear examination he was\r\nperfectly willing to have it spoken about. [Applause.] And when\r\nin Manchester I saw those huge placards: \"Who is Henry Ward\r\nBeecher?\"--[laughter, cries of \"Quite right,\" and applause.]--and\r\nwhen in Liverpool I was told that there were those blood-red placards,\r\npurporting to say what Henry Ward Beecher had said, and calling upon\r\nEnglishmen to suppress free speech--I tell you what I thought. I thought\r\nsimply this: \"I am glad of it.\" [Laughter.] Why? Because if they had felt\r\nperfectly secure, that you are the minions of the South and the slaves\r\nof slavery, they would have been perfectly still. [Applause and uproar.]\r\nAnd, therefore, when I saw so much nervous apprehension that, if I were\r\npermitted to speak--[hisses and applause]--when I found they were afraid\r\nto have me speak [hisses, laughter, and \"No, no!\"]--when I found that\r\nthey considered my speaking damaging to their cause--[applause]--when I\r\nfound that they appealed from facts and reasonings to mob law--[applause\r\nand uproar]--I said, no man need tell me what the heart and secret\r\ncounsel of these men are. They tremble and are afraid. [Applause,\r\nlaughter, hisses, \"No, no!\" and a voice: \"New York mob.\"] Now,\r\npersonally, it is a matter of very little consequence to me whether I\r\nspeak here to-night or not. [Laughter and cheers.] But, one thing is\r\nvery certain, if you do permit me to speak here to-night you will\r\nhear very plain talking. [Applause and hisses.] You will not find a\r\nman--[interruption]--you will not find me to be a man that dared to\r\nspeak about Great Britain 3,000 miles off, and then is afraid to speak\r\nto Great Britain when he stands on her shores. [Immense applause and\r\nhisses.] And if I do not mistake the tone and temper of Englishmen, they\r\nhad rather have a man who opposes them in a manly way--[applause from\r\nall parts of the hall]--than a sneak that agrees with them in an unmanly\r\nway. [Applause and \"Bravo!\"] Now, if I can carry you with me by sound\r\nconvictions, I shall be immensely glad--[applause]; but if I cannot\r\ncarry you with me by facts and sound arguments, I do not wish you to go\r\nwith me at all; and all that I ask is simply FAIR PLAY. [Applause, and a\r\nvoice: \"You shall have it too.\"]\r\n\r\nThose of you who are kind enough to wish to favor my speaking--and you\r\nwill observe that my voice is slightly husky, from having spoken almost\r\nevery night in succession for some time past,--those who wish to hear\r\nme will do me the kindness simply to sit still, and to keep still; and I\r\nand my friends the Secessionists will make all the noise. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\nThere are two dominant races in modern history--the Germanic and the\r\nRomanic races. The Germanic races tend to personal liberty, to a sturdy\r\nindividualism, to civil and to political liberty. The Romanic race tends\r\nto absolutism in government; it is clannish; it loves chieftains; it\r\ndevelops a people that crave strong and showy governments to support and\r\nplan for them. The Anglo-Saxon race belongs to the great German family,\r\nand is a fair exponent of its peculiarities. The Anglo-Saxon carries\r\nself-government and self-development with him wherever he goes. He has\r\npopular GOVERNMENT and popular INDUSTRY; for the effects of a generous\r\ncivil liberty are not seen a whit more plain in the good order, in the\r\nintelligence, and in the virtue of a self-governing people, than in\r\ntheir amazing enterprise and the scope and power of their creative\r\nindustry. The power to create riches is just as much a part of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon virtues as the power to create good order and social safety.\r\nThe things required for prosperous labor, prosperous manufactures, and\r\nprosperous commerce are three. First, liberty; second, liberty; third,\r\nliberty. [Hear, hear!] Though these are not merely the same liberty, as\r\nI shall show you. First, there must be liberty to follow those laws of\r\nbusiness which experience has developed, without imposts or restrictions\r\nor governmental intrusions. Business simply wants to be let alone.\r\n[Hear, hear!] Then, secondly, there must be liberty to distribute and\r\nexchange products of industry in any market without burdensome tariffs,\r\nwithout imposts, and with-out vexatious regulations. There must be these\r\ntwo liberties--liberty to create wealth, as the makers of it think best,\r\naccording to the light and experience which business has given them; and\r\nthen liberty to distribute what they have created without unnecessary\r\nvexatious burdens.\r\n\r\nThe comprehensive law of the ideal industrial condition of the word\r\nis free manufacture and free trade. [Hear, hear! A voice: \"The Morrill\r\ntariff.\" Another voice: \"Monroe.\"] I have said there were three elements\r\nof liberty. The third is the necessity of an intelligent and free race\r\nof customers. There must be freedom among producers; there must\r\nbe freedom among the distributors; there must be freedom among the\r\ncustomers. It may not have occurred to you that it makes any difference\r\nwhat one's customers are, but it does in all regular and prolonged\r\nbusiness. The condition of the customer determines how much he will buy,\r\ndetermines of what sort he will buy. Poor and ignorant people buy little\r\nand that of the poorest kind. The richest and the intelligent, having\r\nthe more means to buy, buy the most, and always buy the best. Here,\r\nthen, are the three liberties: liberty of the producer, liberty of\r\nthe distributor, and liberty of the consumer. The first two need no\r\ndiscussion; they have been long thoroughly and brilliantly illustrated\r\nby the political economists of Great Britain and by her eminent\r\nstatesmen; but it seems to me that enough attention has not been\r\ndirected to the third; and, with your patience, I will dwell upon that\r\nfor a moment, before proceeding to other topics.\r\n\r\nIt is a necessity of every manufacturing and commercial people that\r\ntheir customers should be very wealthy and intelligent. Let us put the\r\nsubject before you in the familiar light of your own local experience.\r\nTo whom do the tradesmen of Liverpool sell the most goods at the highest\r\nprofit? To the ignorant and poor, or to the educated and prosperous? [A\r\nvoice: \"To the Southerners.\" Laughter.] The poor man buys simply for his\r\nbody; he buys food, he buys clothing, he buys fuel, he buys lodging. His\r\nrule is to buy the least and the cheapest that he can. He goes to the\r\nstore as seldom as he can; he brings away as little as he can; and he\r\nbuys for the least he can. [Much laughter.] Poverty is not a misfortune\r\nto the poor only who suffer it, but it is more or less a misfortune to\r\nall with whom he deals. On the other hand, a man well off--how is it\r\nwith him? He buys in far greater quantity. He can afford to do it; he\r\nhas the money to pay for it. He buys in far greater variety, because he\r\nseeks to gratify not merely physical wants, but also mental wants. He\r\nbuys for the satisfaction of sentiment and taste, as well as of sense.\r\nHe buys silk, wool, flax, cotton; he buys all metals--iron, silver,\r\ngold, platinum; in short he buys for all necessities and all substances.\r\nBut that is not all. He buys a better quality of goods. He buys richer\r\nsilks, finer cottons, higher grained wools. Now a rich silk means so\r\nmuch skill and care of somebody's that has been expended upon it to make\r\nit finer and richer; and so of cotton and so of wool. That is, the price\r\nof the finer goods runs back to the very beginning, and remunerates the\r\nworkman as well as the merchant. Now, the whole laboring community is\r\nas much interested and profited as the mere merchant, in this buying and\r\nselling of the higher grades in the greater varieties and quantities.\r\nThe law of price is the skill; and the amount of skill expended in the\r\nwork is as much for the market as are the goods. A man comes to market\r\nand says: \"I have a pair of hands,\" and he obtains the lowest wages.\r\nAnother man comes and says: \"I have something more than a pair of hands;\r\nI have truth and fidelity.\" He gets a higher price. Another man comes\r\nand says: \"I have something more; I have hands, and strength, and\r\nfidelity, and skill.\" He gets more than either of the others.\r\n\r\nThe next man comes and says: \"I have got hands, and strength, and skill,\r\nand fidelity; but my hands work more than that. They know how to create\r\nthings for the fancy, for the affections, for the moral sentiments\"; and\r\nhe gets more than either of the others. The last man comes and says: \"I\r\nhave all these qualities, and have them so highly that it is a peculiar\r\ngenius\"; and genius carries the whole market and gets the highest price.\r\n[Loud applause.] So that both the workman and the merchant are profited\r\nby having purchasers that demand quality, variety, and quantity. Now,\r\nif this be so in the town or the city, it can only be so because it is a\r\nlaw. This is the specific development of a general or universal law, and\r\ntherefore we should expect to find it as true of a nation as of a city\r\nlike Liverpool. I know that it is so, and you know that it is true of\r\nall the world; and it is just as important to have customers educated,\r\nIntelligent, moral, and rich out of Liverpool as it is in Liverpool.\r\n[Applause.] They are able to buy; they want variety, they want the very\r\nbest; and those are the customers you want. That nation is the best\r\ncustomer that is freest, because freedom works prosperity, industry,\r\nand wealth. Great Britain, then, aside from moral considerations, has a\r\ndirect commercial and pecuniary interest in the liberty, civilization,\r\nand wealth of every nation on the globe. [Loud applause.] You also have\r\nan interest in this, because you are a moral and religious people. [\"Oh,\r\noh!\" laughter and applause.] You desire it from the highest motives; and\r\ngodliness is profitable in all things, having the promise of the life\r\nthat now is, as well as of that which is to come; but if there were no\r\nhereafter, and if man had no progress in this life, and if there were no\r\nquestion of civilization at all, it would be worth your while to\r\nprotect civilization and liberty, merely as a commercial speculation. To\r\nevangelize has more than a moral and religious import--it comes back to\r\ntemporal relations. Wherever a nation that is crushed, cramped, degraded\r\nunder despotism is struggling to be free, you, Leeds, Sheffield,\r\nManchester, Paisley, all have an interest that that nation should be\r\nfree. When depressed and backward people demand that they may have a\r\nchance to rise--Hungary, Italy, Poland--it is a duty for humanity's\r\nsake, it is a duty for the highest moral motives, to sympathize with\r\nthem; but besides all these there is a material and an interested\r\nreason why you should sympathize with them. Pounds and pence join with\r\nconscience and with honor in this design. Now, Great Britain's chief\r\nwant is--what?\r\n\r\nThey have said that your chief want is cotton. I deny it. Your chief\r\nwant is consumers. [Applause and hisses.] You have got skill, you have\r\ngot capital, and you have got machinery enough to manufacture goods for\r\nthe whole population of the globe. You could turn out fourfold as much\r\nas you do, if you only had the market to sell in. It is not so much the\r\nwant, therefore, of fabric, though there may be a temporary obstruction\r\nof it; but the principal and increasing want--increasing from year to\r\nyear--is, where shall we find men to buy what we can manufacture so\r\nfast? [Interruption, and a voice, \"The Morrill tariff,\" and applause.]\r\nBefore the American war broke out, your warehouses were loaded\r\nwith goods that you could not sell. [Applause and hisses.] You had\r\nover-manufactured; what is the meaning of over-manufacturing but this:\r\nthat you had skill, capital, machinery, to create faster than you had\r\ncustomers to take goods off your hands? And you know that rich as Great\r\nBritain is, vast as are her manufactures, if she could have fourfold\r\nthe present demand, she could make fourfold riches to-morrow; and\r\nevery political economist will tell you that your want is not cotton\r\nprimarily, but customers. Therefore, the doctrine, how to make\r\ncustomers, is a great deal more important to Great Britain than the\r\ndoctrine how to raise cotton. It is to that doctrine I ask from you,\r\nbusiness men, practical men, men of fact, sagacious Englishmen--to\r\nthat point I ask a moment's attention. [Shouts of \"Oh, oh!\" hisses, and\r\napplause.] There are no more continents to be discovered. [Hear, hear!]\r\nThe market of the future must be found--how? There is very little hope\r\nof any more demand being created by new fields. If you are to have a\r\nbetter market there must be some kind of process invented to make the\r\nold fields better. [A voice, \"Tell us something new,\" shouts of order,\r\nand interruption.] Let us look at it, then. You must civilize the world\r\nin order to make a better class of purchasers. [Interruption.] If you\r\nwere to press Italy down again under the feet of despotism, Italy,\r\ndiscouraged, could draw but very few supplies from you. But give her\r\nliberty, kindle schools throughout her valleys, spur her industry, make\r\ntreaties with her by which she can exchange her wine, and her oil, and\r\nher silk for your manufactured goods; and for every effort that you\r\nmake in that direction there will come back profit to you by increased\r\ntraffic with her. [Loud applause.] If Hungary asks to be an unshackled\r\nnation--if by freedom she will rise in virtue and intelligence, then by\r\nfreedom she will acquire a more multifarious industry, which she will\r\nbe willing to exchange for your manufactures. Her liberty is to be\r\nfound--where? You will find it in the Word of God, you will find it\r\nin the code of history; but you will also find it in the Price Current\r\n[Hear, hear!]; and every free nation, every civilized people--every\r\npeople that rises from barbarism to industry and intelligence, becomes a\r\nbetter customer.\r\n\r\nA savage is a man of one story, and that one story a cellar. When a man\r\nbegins to be civilized, he raises another story. When you Christianize\r\nand civilize the man, you put story upon story, for you develop faculty\r\nafter faculty; and you have to supply every story with your productions.\r\nThe savage is a man one story deep; the civilized man is thirty stories\r\ndeep. [Applause.] Now, if you go to a lodging-house, where there are\r\nthree or four men, your sales to them may, no doubt, be worth something;\r\nbut if you go to a lodging-house like some of those which I saw in\r\nEdinburgh, which seemed to contain about twenty stories [\"Oh, oh!\" and\r\ninterruption], every story of which is full, and all who occupy buy of\r\nyou--which is the better customer, the man who is drawn out, or the man\r\nwho is pinched up? [Laughter.] Now, there is in this a great and sound\r\nprinciple of economy. [\"Yah, yah!\" from the passage outside the hall, and\r\nloud laughter.] If the South should be rendered independent--[at this\r\njuncture mingled cheering and hissing became immense; half the audience\r\nrose to their feet, waving hats and hand-kerchiefs, and in every part of\r\nthe hall there was the greatest commotion and uproar.] You have had your\r\nturn now; now let me have mine again. [Loud applause and laughter.] It\r\nis a little inconvenient to talk against the wind; but after all, if you\r\nwill just keep good-natured--I am not going to lose my temper; will you\r\nwatch yours? [Applause.] Besides all that, it rests me, and gives me a\r\nchance, you know, to get my breath. [Applause and hisses.] And I think\r\nthat the bark of those men is worse than their bite. They do not mean\r\nany harm--they don't know any better. [Loud laughter, applause, hisses,\r\nand continued up-roar.] I was saying, when these responses broke in,\r\nthat it was worth our while to consider both alternatives. What will be\r\nthe result if this present struggle shall eventuate in the separation\r\nof America, and making the South--[loud applause, hisses, hooting,\r\nand cries of \"Bravo!\"]--a slave territory exclusively,--[cries of \"No,\r\nno!\" and laughter]--and the North a free territory,--what will be\r\nthe final result? You will lay the foundation for carrying the slave\r\npopulation clear through to the Pacific Ocean. This is the first step.\r\nThere is not a man that has been a leader of the South any time within\r\nthese twenty years, that has not had this for a plan. It was for this\r\nthat Texas was invaded, first by colonists, next by marauders, until\r\nit was wrested from Mexico. It was for this that they engaged in the\r\nMexican War itself, by which the vast territory reaching to the Pacific\r\nwas added to the Union. Never for a moment have they given up the plan\r\nof spreading the American institutions, as they call them, straight\r\nthrough toward the West, until the slave, who has washed his feet in\r\nthe Atlantic, shall be carried to wash them in the Pacific. [Cries of\r\n\"Question,\" and up-roar.] There! I have got that statement out, and you\r\ncannot put it back. [Laughter and applause.] Now, let us consider the\r\nprospect. If the South becomes a slave empire, what relation will it\r\nhave to you as a customer? [A voice: \"Or any other man.\" Laughter.] It\r\nwould be an empire of 12,000,000 of people. Now, of these, 8,000,000 are\r\nwhite, and 4,000,000 black. [A voice: \"How many have you got?\" Applause\r\nand laughter. Another voice: \"Free your own slaves.\"] Consider that one\r\nthird of the whole are the miserably poor, unbuying blacks. [Cries of\r\n\"No, no!\" \"Yes, yes!\" and interruption.] You do not manufacture much for\r\nthem. [Hisses, \"Oh!\" \"No.\"] You have not got machinery coarse enough.\r\n[Laughter, and \"No.\"] Your labor is too skilled by far to manufacture\r\nbagging and linsey-woolsey. [A Southerner: \"We are going to free them,\r\nevery one.\"] Then you and I agree exactly. [Laughter.] One other third\r\nconsists of a poor, unskilled, degraded white population; and\r\nthe remaining one third, which is a large allowance, we will say,\r\nintelligent and rich.\r\n\r\nNow here are twelve million of people, and only one third of them are\r\ncustomers that can afford to buy the kind of goods that you bring to\r\nmarket. [Interruption and uproar.] My friends, I saw a man once, who was\r\na little late at a railway station, chase an express train. He did not\r\ncatch it. [Laughter.] If you are going to stop this meeting, you have\r\ngot to stop it before I speak; for after I have got the things out, you\r\nmay chase as long as you please--you would not catch them. [Laughter and\r\ninterruption.] But there is luck in leisure; I 'm going to take it easy.\r\n[Laughter.] Two thirds of the population of the Southern States to-day\r\nare non-purchasers of English goods. [A voice: \"No, they are not\"; \"No,\r\nno!\" and uproar.] Now you must recollect another fact--namely, that this\r\nis going on clear through to the Pacific Ocean; and if by sympathy or\r\nhelp you establish a slave empire, you sagacious Britons--[\"Oh, oh!\"\r\nand hooting]--if you like it better, then, I will leave the adjective\r\nout--[laughter, Hear! and applause]--are busy in favoring the\r\nestablishment of an empire from ocean to ocean that should have fewest\r\ncustomers and the largest non-buying population. [Applause, \"No, no!\"\r\nA voice: \"I thought it was the happy people that populated fastest.\"] `\r\n\r\nNow, what can England make for the poor white population of such a\r\nfuture empire, and for her slave population? What carpets, what linens,\r\nwhat cottons can you sell them? What machines, what looking-glasses,\r\nwhat combs, what leather, what books, what pictures, what engravings? [A\r\nvoice: \"We 'll sell them ships.\"] You may sell ships to a few, but what\r\nships can you sell to two thirds of the population of poor whites and\r\nblacks? [Applause.] A little bagging and a little linsey-woolsey, a\r\nfew whips and manacles, are all that you can sell for the slave. [Great\r\napplause and uproar.] This very day, in the slave States of America\r\nthere are eight millions out of twelve millions that are not, and cannot\r\nbe your customers from the very laws of trade. [A voice: \"Then how are\r\nthey clothed?\" and interruption.] * * *\r\n\r\nBut I know that you say, you cannot help sympathizing with a gallant\r\npeople. [Hear, hear!] They are the weaker people, the minority; and you\r\ncannot help going with the minority who are struggling for their rights\r\nagainst the majority. Nothing could be more generous, when a weak party\r\nstands for its own legitimate rights against imperious pride and power,\r\nthan to sympathize with the weak. But who ever sympathized with a weak\r\nthief, because three constables had got hold of him? [Hear, hear!] And\r\nyet the one thief in three policemen's hands is the weaker party.\r\nI suppose you would sympathize with him. [Hear, hear! laughter, and\r\napplause.] Why, when that infamous king of Naples--Bomba, was driven\r\ninto Gaeta by Garibaldi with his immortal band of patriots, and Cavour\r\nsent against him the army of Northern Italy, who was the weaker party\r\nthen? The tyrant and his minions; and the majority was with the noble\r\nItalian patriots, struggling for liberty. I never heard that Old England\r\nsent deputations to King Bomba, and yet his troops resisted bravely\r\nthere. [Laugh-ter and interruption.] To-day the majority of the people\r\nof Rome is with Italy. Nothing but French bayonets keeps her from going\r\nback to the kingdom of Italy, to which she belongs. Do you sympathize\r\nwith the minority in Rome or the majority in Italy? [A voice: \"With\r\nItaly.\"] To-day the South is the minority in America, and they are\r\nfighting for independence! For what? [Uproar. A voice: \"Three cheers\r\nfor independence!\" and hisses.] I could wish so much bravery had a better\r\ncause, and that so much self-denial had been less deluded; that the\r\npoisonous and venomous doctrine of State rights might have been kept\r\naloof; that so many gallant spirits, such as Jackson, might still have\r\nlived. [Great applause and loud cheers, again and again renewed.] The\r\nforce of these facts, historical and incontrovertible, cannot be broken,\r\nexcept by diverting attention by an attack upon the North. It is said\r\nthat the North is fighting for Union, and not for emancipation. The\r\nNorth is fighting for Union, for that ensures emancipation. [Loud\r\ncheers, \"Oh, oh!\" \"No, no!\" and cheers.] A great many men say to\r\nministers of the Gospel: \"You pretend to be preaching and working for\r\nthe love of the people. Why, you are all the time preaching for the\r\nsake of the Church.\" What does the minister say? \"It is by means of the\r\nChurch that we help the people,\" and when men say that we are fighting\r\nfor the Union, I too say we are fighting for the Union. [Hear, hear! and\r\na voice: \"That 's right.\"] But the motive determines the value; and\r\nwhy are we fighting for the Union? Because we never shall forget the\r\ntestimony of our enemies. They have gone off declaring that the Union in\r\nthe hands of the North was fatal to slavery. [Loud applause.] There is\r\ntestimony in court for you. [A voice: \"See that,\" and laughter.] * * *\r\n\r\nIn the first place I am ashamed to confess that such was the\r\nthoughtlessness--[interruption]--such was the stupor of the\r\nNorth--[renewed interruption]--you will get a word at a time; to-morrow\r\nwill let folks see what it is you don't want to hear--that for a period\r\nof twenty-five years she went to sleep, and permitted herself to be\r\ndrugged and poisoned with the Southern prejudice against black men.\r\n[Applause and uproar.] The evil was made worse, because, when any\r\nobject whatever has caused anger between political parties, a political\r\nanimosity arises against that object, no matter how innocent in itself;\r\nno matter what were the original influences which excited the quarrel.\r\nThus the colored man has been the football between the two parties in\r\nthe North, and has suffered accordingly. I confess it to my shame. But\r\nI am speaking now on my own ground, for I began twenty-five years ago,\r\nwith a small party, to combat the unjust dislike of the colored man.\r\n[Loud applause, dissension, and uproar. The interruption at this point\r\nbecame so violent that the friends of Mr. Beecher throughout the hall\r\nrose to their feet, waving hats and handkerchiefs, and renewing their\r\nshouts of applause. The interruption lasted some minutes.] Well, I have\r\nlived to see a total revolution in the Northern feeling--I stand here to\r\nbear solemn witness of that. It is not my opinion; it is my knowledge.\r\n[Great uproar.] Those men who undertook to stand up for the rights of\r\nall men--black as well as white--have increased in number; and now what\r\nparty in the North represents those men that resist the evil prejudices\r\nof past years? The Republicans are that party. [Loud applause.] And who\r\nare those men in the North that have oppressed the negro? They are\r\nthe Peace Democrats; and the prejudice for which in England you are\r\nattempting to punish me, is a prejudice raised by the men who have\r\nopposed me all my life. These pro-slavery Democrats abuse the negro.\r\nI defended him, and they mobbed me for doing it. Oh, justice! [Loud\r\nlaughter, applause, and hisses.] This is as if a man should commit an\r\nassault, maim and wound a neighbor, and a surgeon being called in should\r\nbegin to dress his wounds, and by and by a policeman should come and\r\ncollar the surgeon and haul him off to prison on account of the wounds\r\nwhich he was healing.\r\n\r\nNow, I told you I would not flinch from any thing. I am going to read\r\nyou some questions that were sent after me from Glasgow, purporting\r\nto be from a workingman. [Great interruption.] If those pro-slavery\r\ninterrupters think they will tire me out, they will do more than eight\r\nmillions in America could. [Applause and renewed interruption.] I was\r\nreading a question on your side too. \"Is it not a fact that in most of\r\nthe Northern States laws exist precluding negroes from equal civil and\r\npolitical rights with the whites? That in the State of New York the\r\nnegro has to be the possessor of at least two hundred and fifty dollars'\r\nworth of property to entitle him to the privileges of a white citizen?\r\nThat in some of the Northern States the colored man, whether bond or\r\nfree, is by law excluded altogether, and not suffered to enter the State\r\nlimits, under severe penalties? and is not Mr. Lincoln's own State one\r\nof them? and in view of the fact that the $20,000,000 compensation which\r\nwas promised to Missouri in aid of emancipation was defeated in the last\r\nCongress (the strongest Republican Congress that ever assembled), what\r\nhas the North done toward emancipation?\" Now, then, there 's a dose for\r\nyou. [A voice: \"Answer it.\"] And I will address myself to the answering\r\nof it. And first, the bill for emancipation in Missouri, to which\r\nthis money was denied, was a bill which was drawn by what we call\r\n\"log-rollers,\" who inserted in it an enormously disproportioned price\r\nfor the slaves. The Republicans offered to give them $10,000,000 for\r\nthe slaves in Missouri, and they outvoted it because they could not\r\nget $12,000,000. Already half the slave population had been \"run\" down\r\nSouth, and yet they came up to Congress to get $12,000,000 for what was\r\nnot worth ten millions, nor even eight millions. Now as to those States\r\nthat had passed \"black\" laws, as we call them; they are filled with\r\nSouthern emigrants. The southern parts of Ohio, the southern part of\r\nIndiana, where I myself lived for years, and which I knew like a\r\nbook, the southern part of Illinois, where Mr. Lincoln lives--[great\r\nuproar]--these parts are largely settled by emigrants from Kentucky,\r\nTennessee, Georgia, Virginia, and North Carolina, and it was their vote,\r\nor the Northern votes pandering for political reasons to theirs, that\r\npassed in those States the infamous \"black\" laws; and the Republicans\r\nin these States have a record, clean and white, as having opposed these\r\nlaws in every instance as \"infamous.\" Now as to the State of New York;\r\nit is asked whether a negro is not obliged to have a certain freehold\r\nproperty, or a certain amount of property, before he can vote. It is so\r\nstill in North Carolina and Rhode Island for white folks--it is so in\r\nNew York State. [Mr. Beecher's voice slightly failed him here, and\r\nhe was interrupted by a person who tried to imitate him. Cries of\r\n\"Shame!\" and \"Turn him out!\"] I am not undertaking to say that these\r\nfaults of the North, which were brought upon them by the bad example\r\nand influence of the South, are all cured; but I do say that they are\r\nin process of cure which promises, if unimpeded by foreign influence, to\r\nmake all such odious distinctions vanish.\r\n\r\nThere is another fact that I wish to allude to--not for the sake\r\nof reproach or blame, but by way of claiming your more lenient\r\nconsideration--and that is, that slavery was entailed upon us by your\r\naction. [Hear, hear!] Against the earnest protests of the colonists the\r\nthen government of Great Britain--I will concede not knowing what were\r\nthe mischiefs--ignorantly, but in point of fact, forced slave traffic\r\non the unwilling colonists. [Great uproar, in the midst of which one\r\nindividual was lifted up and carried out of the room amidst cheers and\r\nhisses.]\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN: If you would only sit down no disturbance would take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe disturbance having subsided,\r\n\r\nMR. BEECHER said: I was going to ask you, suppose a child is born with\r\nhereditary disease; suppose this disease was entailed upon him by\r\nparents who had contracted it by their own misconduct, would it be fair\r\nthat those parents that had brought into the world the diseased child,\r\nshould rail at that child because it was diseased. [\"No, no!\"] Would not\r\nthe child have a right to turn round and say: \"Father, it was your\r\nfault that I had it, and you ought to be pleased to be patient with\r\nmy deficiencies.\" [Applause and hisses, and cries of \"Order!\" Great\r\ninterruption and great disturbance here took place on the right of\r\nthe platform; and the chairman said that if the persons around the\r\nunfortunate individual who had caused the disturbance would allow him to\r\nspeak alone, but not assist him in making the disturbance, it might soon\r\nbe put an end to. The interruption continued until another person was\r\ncarried out of the hall.] Mr. Beecher continued: I do not ask that you\r\nshould justify slavery in us, because it was wrong in you two hundred\r\nyears ago; but having ignorantly been the means of fixing it upon us,\r\nnow that we are struggling with mortal struggles to free ourselves from\r\nit, we have a right to your tolerance, your patience, and charitable\r\nconstructions.\r\n\r\nNo man can unveil the future; no man can tell what revolutions are about\r\nto break upon the world; no man can tell what destiny belongs to France,\r\nnor to any of the European powers; but one thing is certain, that in the\r\nexigencies of the future there will be combinations and recombinations,\r\nand that those nations that are of the same faith, the same blood, and\r\nthe same substantial interests, ought not to be alienated from each\r\nother, but ought to stand together. [Immense cheering and hisses.] I\r\ndo not say that you ought not to be in the most friendly alliance\r\nwith France or with Germany; but I do say that your own children, the\r\noffspring of England, ought to be nearer to you than any people of\r\nstrange tongue. [A voice: \"Degenerate sons,\" applause and hisses;\r\nanother voice: \"What about the Trent?\"] If there had been any feelings\r\nof bitterness in America, let me tell you that they had been excited,\r\nrightly or wrongly, under the impression that Great Britain was going\r\nto intervene between us and our own lawful struggle. [A voice: \"No!\" and\r\napplause.] With the evidence that there is no such intention all bitter\r\nfeelings will pass away. [Applause.] We do not agree with the recent\r\ndoctrine of neutrality as a question of law. But it is past, and we are\r\nnot disposed to raise that question. We accept it now as a fact, and\r\nwe say that the utterance of Lord Russell at Blairgowrie--[Applause,\r\nhisses, and a voice: \"What about Lord Brougham?\"]--together with the\r\ndeclaration of the government in stopping war-steamers here--[great\r\nuproar, and applause]--has gone far toward quieting every fear and\r\nremoving every apprehension from our minds. [Uproar and shouts of\r\napplause.] And now in the future it is the work of every good man and\r\npatriot not to create divisions, but to do the things that will make for\r\npeace. [\"Oh, oh!\" and laughter.] On our part it shall be done. [Applause\r\nand hisses, and \"No, no!\"] On your part it ought to be done; and when\r\nin any of the convulsions that come upon the world, Great Britain finds\r\nherself struggling single-handed against the gigantic powers that spread\r\noppression and darkness--[applause, hisses, and uproar]--there ought to\r\nbe such cordiality that she can turn and say to her first-born and most\r\nillustrious child, \"Come!\" [Hear, hear! applause, tremendous cheers,\r\nand uproar.] I will not say that England cannot again, as hitherto,\r\nsingle-handed manage any power--[applause and uproar]--but I will say\r\nthat England and America together for religion and liberty--[A voice:\r\n\"Soap, soap,\" uproar, and great applause]--are a match for the world.\r\n[Applause; a voice: \"They don't want any more soft soap.\"] Now,\r\ngentlemen and ladies--[A voice: \"Sam Slick\"; and another voice: \"Ladies\r\nand gentlemen, if you please,\"]--when I came I was asked whether I would\r\nanswer questions, and I very readily consented to do so, as I had in\r\nother places; but I will tell you it was because I expected to have the\r\nopportunity of speaking with some sort of ease and quiet. [A voice: \"So\r\nyou have.\"] I have for an hour and a half spoken against a storm--[Hear,\r\nhear!]--and you yourselves are witnesses that, by the interruption, I\r\nhave been obliged to strive with my voice, so that I no longer have the\r\npower to control this assembly. [Applause.] And although I am in spirit\r\nperfectly willing to answer any question, and more than glad of\r\nthe chance, yet I am by this very unnecessary opposition to-night\r\nincapacitated physically from doing it. Ladies and gentlemen, I bid you\r\ngood-evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nTHE GETTYSBURGH ADDRESS,\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 19, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nFourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this\r\ncontinent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the\r\nproposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a\r\ngreat civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived\r\nand so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of\r\nthat war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final\r\nresting-place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might\r\nlive. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But\r\nin a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot\r\nhallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here,\r\nhave consecrated it far above our power to add or detract. The world\r\nwill little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can\r\nnever forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather to be\r\ndedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have\r\nthus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to\r\nthe great task remaining before us, that from these honored dead we\r\ntake increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full\r\nmeasure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall\r\nnot have died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall have a new\r\nbirth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, and\r\nfor the people, shall not perish from the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nSECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS,\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\nFELLOW-COUNTRYMEN:\r\n\r\nAt this second appearing to take the oath of the Presidential office,\r\nthere is less occasion for an extended address than there was at first.\r\nThen a statement, somewhat in detail, of a course to be pursued seemed\r\nvery fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four years, during\r\nwhich public declarations have been constantly called forth on every\r\npoint and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention\r\nand engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could be\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nThe progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as\r\nwell known to the public as to myself, and it is, I trust, reasonably\r\nsatisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the future, no\r\nprediction in regard to it is ventured.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughts were\r\nanxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought\r\nto avoid it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this\r\nplace, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent\r\nagents were in the city seeking to destroy it with war--seeking to\r\ndissolve the Union and divide the effects by negotiation. Both parties\r\ndeprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the\r\nnation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it\r\nperish, and the war came. One eighth of the whole population were\r\ncolored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized\r\nin the Southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and\r\npowerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause\r\nof the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the\r\nobject for which the insurgents would rend the Union by war, while the\r\ngovernment claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial\r\nenlargement of it.\r\n\r\nNeither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which\r\nit has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the\r\nconflict might cease when, or even before the conflict itself should\r\ncease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental\r\nand astounding. Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and\r\neach invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men\r\nshould dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from\r\nthe sweat of other men's faces, but let us judge not, that we be not\r\njudged. The prayer of both could not be answered. That of neither has\r\nbeen answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. Woe unto the\r\nworld because of offences, for it must needs be that offences come, but\r\nwoe to that man by whom the offence cometh. If we shall suppose that\r\nAmerican slavery is one of those offences which, in the providence of\r\nGod, must needs come, but which having continued through His appointed\r\ntime, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South\r\nthis terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offence came,\r\nshall we discern there any departure from those Divine attributes which\r\nthe believers in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope,\r\nfervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass\r\naway. Yet if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by\r\nthe bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be\r\nsunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by\r\nanother drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago,\r\nso still it must be said, that the judgments of the Lord are true and\r\nrighteous altogether.\r\n\r\nWith malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the\r\nright as God gives us to see the right, let us finish the work we are\r\nin, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have\r\nborne the battle, and for his widow and his orphans, to do all which may\r\nachieve and cherish a just and a lasting peace among ourselves and with\r\nall nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY WINTER DAVIS,\r\n\r\nOF MARYLAND. (BORN 1817, DIED 1865.)\r\n\r\nON RECONSTRUCTION; THE FIRST REPUBLICAN THEORY;\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, MARCH 22, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. SPEAKER:\r\n\r\nThe bill which I am directed by the committee on the rebellious States\r\nto report is one which provides for the restoration of civil government\r\nin States whose governments have been overthrown. It prescribes such\r\nconditions as will secure not only civil government to the people of\r\nthe rebellious States, but will also secure to the people of the United\r\nStates permanent peace after the suppression of the rebellion. The bill\r\nchallenges the support of all who consider slavery the cause of the\r\nrebellion, and that in it the embers of rebellion will always smoulder;\r\nof those who think that freedom and permanent peace are inseparable, and\r\nwho are determined, so far as their constitutional authority will\r\nallow them, to secure these fruits by adequate legislation. * * * It is\r\nentitled to the support of all gentlemen upon this side of the House,\r\nwhatever their views may be of the nature of the rebellion, and the\r\nrelation in which it has placed the people and States in rebellion\r\ntoward the United States; not less of those who think that the rebellion\r\nhas placed the citizens of the rebel States beyond the protection of the\r\nConstitution, and that Congress, therefore, has supreme power over them\r\nas conquered enemies, than of that other class who think that they\r\nhave not ceased to be citizens and States of the United States, though\r\nincapable of exercising political privileges under the Constitution, but\r\nthat Congress is charged with a high political power by the Constitution\r\nto guarantee republican governments in the States, and that this is the\r\nproper time and the proper mode of exercising it. It is also entitled\r\nto the favorable consideration of gentlemen upon the other side of the\r\nHouse who honestly and deliberately express their judgment that slavery\r\nis dead. To them it puts the question whether it is not advisable to\r\nbury it out of sight, that its ghost may no longer stalk abroad to\r\nfrighten us from our propriety. * * *\r\n\r\nWhat is the nature of this case with which we have to deal, the evil\r\nwe must remedy, the danger we must avert? In other words, what is that\r\nmonster of political wrong which is called secession? It is not, Mr.\r\nSpeaker, domestic violence, within the meaning of that clause of the\r\nConstitution, for the violence was the act of the people of those States\r\nthrough their governments, and was the offspring of their free and\r\nunforced will. It is not invasion, in the meaning of the Constitution,\r\nfor no State has been invaded against the will of the government of the\r\nState by any power except the United States marching to overthrow the\r\nusurpers of its territory. It is, therefore, the act of the people of\r\nthe States, carrying with it all the consequences of such an act.\r\nAnd therefore it must be either a legal revolution, which makes them\r\nindependent, and makes of the United States a foreign country, or it is\r\na usurpation against the authority of the United States, the erection\r\nof governments which do not recognize the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, which the Constitution does not recognize, and, therefore, not\r\nrepublican governments of the States in rebellion. The latter is\r\nthe view which all parties take of it. I do not understand that any\r\ngentleman on the other side of the House says that any rebel government\r\nwhich does not recognize the Constitution of the United States, and\r\nwhich is not recognized by Congress, is a State government within the\r\nmeaning of the Constitution. Still less can it be said that there is a\r\nState government, republican or unrepublican, in the State of Tennessee,\r\nwhere there is no government of any kind, no civil authority, no\r\norganized form of administration except that represented by the flag of\r\nthe United States, obeying the will and under the orders of the military\r\nofficer in command. * * *\r\n\r\nThose that are here represented are the only governments existing within\r\nthe limits of the United States. Those that are not here represented are\r\nnot governments of the States, republican under the Constitution. And\r\nif they be not, then they are military usurpations, inaugurated as the\r\npermanent governments of the States, contrary to the supreme law of the\r\nland, arrayed in arms against the Government of the United States;\r\nand it is the duty, the first and highest duty, of the government to\r\nsuppress and expel them. Congress must either expel or recognize and\r\nsupport them. If it do not guarantee them, it is bound to expel them;\r\nand they who are not ready to suppress are bound to recognize them.\r\n\r\nWe are now engaged in suppressing a military usurpation of the authority\r\nof the State governments. When that shall have been accomplished, there\r\nwill be no form of State authority in existence which Congress can\r\nrecognize. Our success will be the overthrow of all sent balance of\r\ngovernment in the rebel States. The Government of the United States is\r\nthen in fact the only government existing in those States, and it is\r\nthere charged to guarantee them republican governments.\r\n\r\nWhat jurisdiction does the duty of guaranteeing a republican government\r\nconfer under such circumstances upon Congress? What right does it give?\r\nWhat laws may it pass? What objects may it accomplish? What conditions\r\nmay it insist upon, and what judgment may it exercise in determining\r\nwhat it will do? The duty of guaranteeing carries with it the right\r\nto pass all laws necessary and proper to guarantee. The duty of\r\nguaranteeing means the duty to accomplish the result. It means that the\r\nrepublican government shall exist. It means that every opposition to\r\nrepublican government shall be put down. It means that every thing\r\ninconsistent with the permanent continuance of republican government\r\nshall be weeded out. It places in the hands of Congress to say what is\r\nand what is not, with all the light of experience and all the lessons of\r\nthe past, inconsistent, in its judgment, with the permanent continuance\r\nof republican government; and if, in its judgment, any form of policy\r\nis radically and inherently inconsistent with the permanent and enduring\r\npeace of the country, with the permanent supremacy of republican\r\ngovernment, and it have the manliness to say so, there is no power,\r\njudicial or executive, in the United States that can even question\r\nthis judgment but the people; and they can do it only by sending\r\nother Representatives here to undo our work. The very language of\r\nthe Constitution, and the necessary logic of the case, involve that\r\nconsequence. The denial of the right of secession means that all the\r\nterritory of the United States shall remain under the jurisdiction of\r\nthe Constitution. If there can be no State government which does not\r\nrecognize the Constitution, and which the authorities of the United\r\nStates do not recognize, then there are these alternatives, and these\r\nonly: the rebel States must be governed by Congress till they submit\r\nand form a State government under the Constitution; or Congress must\r\nrecognize State governments which do not recognize either Congress\r\nor the Constitution of the United States; or there must be an entire\r\nabsence of all government in the rebel States--and that is anarchy.\r\nTo recognize a government which does not recognize the Constitution is\r\nabsurd, for a government is not a constitution; and the recognition of\r\na State government means the acknowledgment of men as governors and\r\nlegislators and judges, actually invested with power to make laws, to\r\njudge of crimes, to convict the citizens of other States, to demand the\r\nsurrender of fugitives from justice, to arm and command the militia, to\r\nrequire the United States to repress all opposition to its authority,\r\nand to protect it against invasion--against our own armies; whose\r\nSenators and Representatives are entitled to seats in Congress, and\r\nwhose electoral votes must be counted in the election of the President\r\nof a government which they disown and defy. To accept the alternative\r\nof anarchy as the constitutional condition of a State is to assert the\r\nfailure of the Constitution and the end of republican government. Until,\r\ntherefore, Congress recognize a State government, organized under\r\nits auspices, there is no government in the rebel States except the\r\nauthority of Congress. * * * When military opposition shall have been\r\nsuppressed, not merely paralyzed, driven into a corner, pushed back, but\r\ngone, the horrid vision of civil war vanished from the South, then\r\ncall upon the people to reorganize in their own way, subject to the\r\nconditions that we think essential to our permanent peace, and to\r\nprevent the revival hereafter of the rebellion--a republican government\r\nin the form that the people of the United States can agree to.\r\n\r\nNow, for that purpose there are three modes indicated. One is to remove\r\nthe cause of the war by an alteration of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, prohibiting slavery everywhere within its limits. That, sir,\r\ngoes to the root of the matter, and should consecrate the nation's\r\ntriumph. But there are thirty-four States; three fourths of them would\r\nbe twenty-six. I believe there are twenty-five States represented in\r\nthis Congress; so that we on that basis can-not change the Constitution.\r\nIt is, therefore,a condition precedent in that view of the case that\r\nmore States shall have governments organized within them. If it be\r\nassumed that the basis of calculation shall be three fourths of the\r\nStates now represented in Congress, I agree to that construction of the\r\nConstitution. * * *\r\n\r\nBut, under any circumstances, even upon that basis it will be difficult\r\nto find three fourths of the States, with New Jersey, or Kentucky, or\r\nMaryland, or Delaware, or other States that might be mentioned,\r\nopposed to it, under existing auspices, to adopt such a clause of the\r\nConstitution after we shall have agreed to it. If adopted it still\r\nleaves all laws necessary to the ascertainment of the will of the\r\npeople, and all restrictions on the return to power of the leaders of\r\nthe rebellion, wholly unprovided for. The amendment of the Constitution\r\nmeets my hearty approval, but it is not a remedy for the evils we must\r\ndeal with.\r\n\r\nThe next plan is that inaugurated by the President of the United States,\r\nin the proclamation of the 8th December (1863), called the amnesty\r\nproclamation. That proposes no guardianship of the United States over\r\nthe reorganization of the governments, no law to prescribe who shall\r\nvote, no civil functionaries to see that the law is faithfully executed,\r\nno supervising authority to control and judge of the election. But if\r\nin any manner by the toleration of martial law, lately proclaimed the\r\nfundamental law, under the dictation of any military authority, or\r\nunder the prescription of a provost marshal, something in the form of a\r\ngovernment shall be presented, represented to rest on the votes of one\r\ntenth of the population, the President will recognize that, provided\r\nit does not contravene the proclamation of freedom and the laws of\r\nCongress; and to secure that an oath is exacted. There is no guaranty\r\nof law to watch over the organization of that government. It may be\r\nrecognized by the military power, and not recognized by the civil\r\npower, so that it would have a doubtful existence, half civil and half\r\nmilitary, neither a temporary government by law of Congress nor a\r\nState government, something as unknown to the Constitution as the rebel\r\ngovernment that refuses to recognize it. The only prescription is that\r\nit shall not contravene the provisions of the proclamation. Sir, if that\r\nproclamation be valid, then we are relieved from all trouble on that\r\nscore. But if that proclamation be not valid, then the oath to support\r\nit is without legal sanction, for the President can ask no man to\r\nbind himself by an oath to support an unfounded proclamation or an\r\nunconstitutional law even for a moment, still less after it shall have\r\nbeen declared void by the Supreme Court of the United States. * * *\r\n\r\nBy the bill we propose to preclude the judicial question by the solution\r\nof a political question. How so? By the paramount power of Congress to\r\nreorganize governments in those States, to impose such conditions as it\r\nthinks necessary to secure the permanence of republican government, to\r\nrefuse to recognize any governments there which do not prohibit slavery\r\nforever. Ay, gentlemen, take the responsibility to say in the face of\r\nthose who clamor for the speedy recognition of governments tolerating\r\nslavery, that the safety of the people of the United States is the\r\nsupreme law; that their will is the supreme rule of law, and that we\r\nare authorized to pronounce their will on this subject. Take the\r\nresponsibility to say that we will revise the judgments of our\r\nancestors; that we have experience written in blood which they had\r\nnot; that we find now what they darkly doubted, that slavery is really,\r\nradically inconsistent with the permanence of republican governments;\r\nand that being charged by the supreme law of the land on our conscience\r\nand judgment to guarantee, that is to continue, maintain and enforce,\r\nif it exist, to institute and restore, when overthrown, republican\r\ngovernment throughout the broad limits of the republic, we will weed\r\nout every element of their policy which we think incompatible with its\r\npermanence and endurance. The purpose of the bill is to preclude\r\nthe judicial question of the validity and effect of the President's\r\nproclamation by the decision of the political authority in reorganizing\r\nthe State governments. It makes the rule of decision the provisions\r\nof the State constitution, which, when recognized by Congress, can be\r\nquestioned in no court; and it adds to the authority of the proclamation\r\nthe sanction of Congress. If gentlemen say that the Constitution does\r\nnot bear that construction, we will go before the people of the United\r\nStates on that question, and by their judgment we will abide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE H. PENDLETON,\r\n\r\nOF OHIO. (BORN 1825, DIED 1889.)\r\n\r\nON RECONSTRUCTION; THE DEMOCRATIC THEORY;\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, MAY 4, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gentleman [Mr. H. W. Davis] maintains two propositions, which lie\r\nat the very basis of his views on this subject. He has explained them to\r\nthe House, and enforced them on other occasions. He maintains that, by\r\nreason of their secession, the seceded States and their citizens \"have\r\nnot ceased to be citizens and States of the United States, though\r\nincapable of exercising political privileges under the Constitution, but\r\nthat Congress is charged with a high political power by the Constitution\r\nto guarantee republican government in the States, and that this is\r\nthe proper time and the proper mode of exercising it.\" This act of\r\nrevolution on the part of the seceding States has evoked the most\r\nextraordinary theories upon the relations of the States to the Federal\r\nGovernment. This theory of the gentleman is one of them.\r\n\r\nThe ratification of the Constitution by Virginia established the\r\nrelation between herself and the Federal Government; it created the\r\nlink between her and all the States; it announced her assumption of\r\nthe duties, her title to the rights, of the confederating States; it\r\nproclaimed her interest in, her power over, her obedience to, the\r\ncommon agent of all the States. If Virginia had never ordained that\r\nratification, she would have been an independent State; the Constitution\r\nwould have been as perfect and the union between the ratifying States\r\nwould have been as complete as they now are. Virginia repeals that\r\nordinance, annuls that bond of union, breaks that link of confederation.\r\nShe repeals but a single law, repeals it by the action of a sovereign\r\nconvention, leaves her constitution, her laws, her political and social\r\npolity untouched. And the gentleman from Maryland tells us that the\r\neffect of this repeal is not to destroy the vigor of that law, but to\r\nsubvert the State government, and to render the citizens \"incapable of\r\nexercising political privileges\"; that the Union remains, but that one\r\nparty to it has thereby lost its corporate existence, and the other has\r\nadvanced to the control and government of it.\r\n\r\nSir, this cannot be. Gentlemen must not palter in a double sense. These\r\nacts of secession are either valid or invalid. If they are valid, they\r\nseparated the State from the Union. If they are invalid, they are void;\r\nthey have no effect; the State officers who act upon them are rebels\r\nto the Federal Government; the States are not destroyed; their\r\nconstitutions are not abrogated; their officers are committing illegal\r\nacts, for which they are liable to punishment; the States have never\r\nleft the Union, but, as soon as their officers shall perform their\r\nduties or other officers shall assume their places, will again perform\r\nthe duties imposed, and enjoy the privileges conferred, by the\r\nFederal compact, and this not by virtue of a new ratification of the\r\nConstitution, nor a new admission by the Federal Government, but by\r\nvirtue of the original ratification, and the constant, uninterrupted\r\nmaintenance of position in the Federal Union since that date.\r\n\r\nActs of secession are not invalid to destroy the Union, and valid to\r\ndestroy the State governments and the political privileges of their\r\ncitizens. We have heard much of the twofold relations which citizens of\r\nthe seceded States may hold to the Federal Government--that they may be\r\nat once belligerents and rebellious citizens. I believe there are some\r\njudicial decisions to that effect. Sir, it is impossible. The Federal\r\nGovernment may possibly have the right to elect in which relation\r\nit will deal with them; it cannot deal at one and the same time in\r\ninconsistent relations. Belligerents, being captured, are entitled to\r\nbe treated as prisoners of war; rebellious citizens are liable to be\r\nhanged. The private property of belligerents, according to the rules\r\nof modern war, shall not be taken without compensation; the property\r\nof rebellious citizens is liable to confiscation. Belligerents are\r\nnot amenable to the local criminal law, nor to the jurisdiction of the\r\ncourts which administer it; rebellious citizens are, and the officers\r\nare bound to enforce the law and exact the penalty of its infraction.\r\nThe seceded States are either in the Union or out of it. If in the\r\nUnion, their constitutions are untouched, their State governments are\r\nmaintained, their citizens are entitled to all political rights, except\r\nso far as they may be deprived of them by the criminal law which they\r\nhave infracted.\r\n\r\nThis seems incomprehensible to the gentleman from Maryland. In his view,\r\nthe whole State government centres in the men who administer it, so\r\nthat, when they administer it unwisely, or put it in antagonism to\r\nthe Federal Government, the State government is dissolved, the State\r\nconstitution is abrogated, and the State is left, in fact and in form,\r\n_de jure_ and _de facto_, in anarchy, except so far as the Federal\r\nGovernment may rightfully intervene. * * * I submit that these gentlemen\r\ndo not see with their usual clearness of vision. If, by a plague or\r\nother visitation of God, every officer of a State government should at\r\nthe same moment die, so that not a single person clothed with official\r\npower should remain, would the State government be destroyed? Not\r\nat all. For the moment it would not be administered; but as soon as\r\nofficers were elected, and assumed their respective duties, it would be\r\ninstantly in full force and vigor.\r\n\r\nIf these States are out of the Union, their State governments are still\r\nin force, unless otherwise changed; their citizens are to the Federal\r\nGovernment as foreigners, and it has in relation to them the same\r\nrights, and none other, as it had in relation to British subjects in\r\nthe war of 1812, or to the Mexicans in 1846. Whatever may be the true\r\nrelation of the seceding States, the Federal Government derives no\r\npower in relation to them or their citizens from the provision of the\r\nConstitution now under consideration, but, in the one case, derives all\r\nits power from the duty of enforcing the \"supreme law of the land,\" and\r\nin the other, from the power \"to declare war.\"\r\n\r\nThe second proposition of the gentleman from Maryland is this--I use\r\nhis language: \"That clause vests in the Congress of the United States\r\na plenary, supreme, unlimited political jurisdiction, paramount over\r\ncourts, subject only to the judgment of the people of the United States,\r\nembracing within its scope every legislative measure necessary and\r\nproper to make it effectual; and what is necessary and proper the\r\nConstitution refers in the first place to our judgment, subject to no\r\nrevision but that of the people.\"\r\n\r\nThe gentleman states his case too strongly. The duty imposed on Congress\r\nis doubtless important, but Congress has no right to use a means of\r\nperforming it forbidden by the Constitution, no matter how necessary or\r\nproper it might be thought to be. But, sir, this doctrine is monstrous.\r\nIt has no foundation in the Constitution. It subjects all the States\r\nto the will of Congress; it places their institutions at the feet of\r\nCongress. It creates in Congress an absolute, unqualified despotism. It\r\nasserts the power of Congress in changing the State governments to be\r\n\"plenary, supreme, unlimited,\" \"subject only to revision by the people\r\nof the United States.\" The rights of the people of the State are\r\nnothing; their will is nothing. Congress first decides; the people of\r\nthe whole Union revise. My own State of Ohio is liable at any moment to\r\nbe called in question for her constitution. She does not permit negroes\r\nto vote. If this doctrine be true, Congress may decide that this\r\nexclusion is anti-republican, and by force of arms abrogate that\r\nconstitution and set up another, permitting negroes to vote. From that\r\ndecision of Congress there is no appeal to the people of Ohio, but\r\nonly to the people of New York and Massachusetts and Wisconsin, at the\r\nelection of representatives, and, if a majority cannot be elected to\r\nreverse the decision, the people of Ohio must submit. Woe be to the\r\nday when that doctrine shall be established, for from its centralized\r\ndespotism we will appeal to the sword!\r\n\r\nSir, the rights of the States were the foundation corners of the\r\nconfederation. The Constitution recognized them, maintained them,\r\nprovided for their perpetuation. Our fathers thought them the safeguard\r\nof our liberties. They have proved so. They have reconciled liberty\r\nwith empire; they have reconciled the freedom of the individual with the\r\nincrease of our magnificent domain. They are the test, the touchstone,\r\nthe security of our liberties. This bill, and the avowed doctrine of its\r\nsupporters, sweeps them all instantly away. It substitutes despotism for\r\nself-government--despotism the more severe because vested in a numerous\r\nCongress elected by a people who may not feel the exercise of its power.\r\nIt subverts the government, destroys the confederation, and erects a\r\ntyranny on the ruins of republican governments. It creates unity--it\r\ndestroys liberty; it maintains integrity of territory, but destroys the\r\nrights of the citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHADDEUS STEVENS,\r\n\r\nOF PENNSYLVANIA. (BORN 1792, DIED 1868.)\r\n\r\nON RECONSTRUCTION; THE RADICAL REPUBLICAN THEORY;\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, DECEMBER 18, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\nA candid examination of the power and proper principles of\r\nreconstruction can be offensive to no one, and may possibly be\r\nprofitable by exciting inquiry. One of the suggestions of the message\r\nwhich we are now considering has special reference to this. Perhaps\r\nit is the principle most interesting to the people at this time. The\r\nPresident assumes, what no one doubts, that the late rebel States have\r\nlost their constitutional relations to the Union, and are incapable of\r\nrepresentation in Congress, except by permission of the Government. It\r\nmatters but little, with this admission, whether you call them States\r\nout of the Union, and now conquered territories, or assert that because\r\nthe Constitution forbids them to do what they did do, that they are\r\ntherefore only dead as to all national and political action, and will\r\nremain so until the Government shall breathe into them the breath of\r\nlife anew and permit them to occupy their former position. In other\r\nwords, that they are not out of the Union, but are only dead carcasses\r\nlying within the Union. In either case, it is very plain that it\r\nrequires the action of Congress to enable them to form a State\r\ngovernment and send representatives to Congress. Nobody, I believe,\r\npretends that with their old constitutions and frames of government they\r\ncan be permitted to claim their old rights under the Constitution. They\r\nhave torn their constitutional States into atoms, and built on their\r\nfoundations fabrics of a totally different character. Dead men cannot\r\nraise themselves. Dead States cannot restore their own existence \"as it\r\nwas.\" Whose especial duty is it to do it? In whom does the Constitution\r\nplace the power? Not in the judicial branch of Government, for it only\r\nadjudicates and does not prescribe laws. Not in the Executive, for he\r\nonly executes and cannot make laws. Not in the Commander-in-Chief of\r\nthe armies, for he can only hold them under military rule until the\r\nsovereign legislative power of the conqueror shall give them law.\r\n\r\nThere is fortunately no difficulty in solving the question. There are\r\ntwo provisions in the Constitution, under one of which the case must\r\nfall. The fourth article says:\r\n\r\n\"New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union.\"\r\n\r\nIn my judgment this is the controlling provision in this case.\r\nUnless the law of nations is a dead letter, the late war between two\r\nacknowledged belligerents severed their original compacts, and broke all\r\nthe ties that bound them together. The future condition of the conquered\r\npower depends on the will of the conqueror. They must come in as new\r\nStates or remain as conquered provinces. Congress--the Senate and House\r\nof Representatives, with the concurrence of the President--is the\r\nonly power that can act in the matter. But suppose, as some dreaming\r\ntheorists imagine, that these States have never been out of the Union,\r\nbut have only destroyed their State governments so as to be incapable of\r\npolitical action; then the fourth section of the fourth article applies,\r\nwhich says:\r\n\r\n\"The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a\r\nrepublican form of government.\"\r\n\r\nWho is the United States? Not the judiciary; not the President; but the\r\nsovereign power of the people, exercised through their representatives\r\nin Congress, with the concurrence of the Executive. It means the\r\npolitical Government--the concurrent action of both branches of Congress\r\nand the Executive. The separate action of each amounts to nothing,\r\neither in admitting new States or guaranteeing republican governments\r\nto lapsed or outlawed States. Whence springs the preposterous idea that\r\neither the President, or the Senate, or the House of Representatives,\r\nacting separately, can determine the right of States to send members or\r\nSenators to the Congress of the Union?\r\n\r\nTo prove that they are and for four years have been out of the Union for\r\nall legal purposes, and, being now conquered, subject to the absolute\r\ndisposal of Congress, I will suggest a few ideas and adduce a few\r\nauthorities. If the so-called \"confederate States of America\" were an\r\nindependent belligerent, and were so acknowledged by the United States\r\nand by Europe, or had assumed and maintained an attitude which entitled\r\nthem to be considered and treated as a belligerent, then, during such\r\ntime, they were precisely in the condition of a foreign nation with whom\r\nwe were at war; nor need their independence as a nation be acknowledged\r\nby us to produce that effect.\r\n\r\nAfter such clear and repeated decisions it is something worse than\r\nridiculous to hear men of respectable standing attempting to nullify the\r\nlaw of nations, and declare the Supreme Court of the United States in\r\nerror, because, as the Constitution forbids it, the States could not go\r\nout of the Union in fact. A respectable gentleman was lately reciting\r\nthis argument, when he suddenly stopped and said, \"Did you hear of that\r\natrocious murder committed in our town? A rebel deliberately murdered\r\na Government official.\" The person addressed said, \"I think you are\r\nmistaken.\" \"How so? I saw it myself.\" \"You are wrong, no murder was or\r\ncould be committed, for the law forbids it.\"\r\n\r\nThe theory that the rebel States, for four years a separate power and\r\nwithout representation in Congress, were all the time here in the Union,\r\nis a good deal less ingenious and respectable than the metaphysics of\r\nBerkeley, which proved that neither the world nor any human being was in\r\nexistence. If this theory were simply ridiculous it could be forgiven;\r\nbut its effect is deeply injurious to the stability of the nation. I\r\ncannot doubt that the late confederate States are out of the Union\r\nto all intents and purposes for which the conqueror may choose so to\r\nconsider them.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nBut suppose these powerful but now subdued belligerents, instead of\r\nbeing out of the Union, are merely destroyed, and are now lying about,\r\na dead corpse, or with animation so suspended as to be incapable of\r\naction, and wholly unable to heal themselves by any unaided movements of\r\ntheir own. Then they may fall under the provision of the Constitution,\r\nwhich says \"The United States shall guarantee to every State in the\r\nUnion a republican form of government.\" Under that power, can the\r\njudiciary, or the President, or the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, or\r\nthe Senate or House of Representatives, acting separately, restore them\r\nto life and readmit them into the Union? I insist that if each acted\r\nseparately, though the action of each was identical with all the others,\r\nit would amount to nothing. Nothing but the joint action of the two\r\nHouses of Congress and the concurrence of the President could do it.\r\nIf the Senate admitted their Senators, and the House their members,\r\nit would have no effect on the future action of Congress. The Fortieth\r\nCongress might reject both. Such is the ragged record of Congress for\r\nthe last four years.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nCongress alone can do it. But Congress does not mean the Senate, or the\r\nHouse of Representatives, and President, all acting severally. Their\r\njoint action constitutes Congress. Hence a law of Congress must be\r\npassed before any new State can be admitted, or any dead ones revived.\r\nUntil then no member can be lawfully admitted into either House. Hence\r\nit appears with how little knowledge of constitutional law each branch\r\nis urged to admit members separately from these destroyed States. The\r\nprovision that \"each House shall be the judge of the elections, returns,\r\nand qualifications of its own members,\" has not the most distant bearing\r\non this question. Congress must create States and declare when they\r\nare entitled to be represented. Then each House must judge whether\r\nthe members presenting themselves from a recognized State possess the\r\nrequisite qualifications of age, residence, and citizenship; and whether\r\nthe elections and returns are according to law. The Houses, separately,\r\ncan judge of nothing else. It seems amazing that any man of legal\r\neducation could give it any larger meaning.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious from all this that the first duty of Congress is to pass\r\na law declaring the condition of these outside or defunct States, and\r\nproviding proper civil governments for them. Since the conquest\r\nthey have been governed by martial law. Military rule is necessarily\r\ndespotic, and ought not to exist longer than is absolutely necessary.\r\nAs there are no symptoms that the people of these provinces will be\r\nprepared to participate in constitutional government for some years, I\r\nknow of no arrangement so proper for them as territorial governments.\r\nThere they can learn the principles of freedom and eat the fruit of\r\nfoul rebellion. Under such governments, while electing members to the\r\nterritorial Legislatures, they will necessarily mingle with those\r\nto whom Congress shall extend the right of suffrage. In Territories,\r\nCongress fixes the qualifications of electors; and I know of no better\r\nplace nor better occasion for the conquered rebels and the conqueror to\r\npractise justice to all men, and accustom themselves to make and to obey\r\nequal laws.\r\n\r\nAnd these fallen rebels cannot at their option reenter the heaven which\r\nthey have disturbed, the garden of Eden which they have deserted;\r\nas flaming swords are set at the gates to secure their exclusion, it\r\nbecomes important to the welfare of the nation to inquire when the doors\r\nshall be reopened for their admission.\r\n\r\nAccording to my judgment they ought never to be recognized as capable\r\nof acting in the Union, or of being counted as valid States, until the\r\nConstitution shall have been so amended as to make it what its framers\r\nintended, and so as to secure perpetual ascendency to the party of the\r\nUnion; and so as to render our republican Government firm and stable\r\nforever. The first of those amendments is to change the basis of\r\nrepresentation among the States from Federal members to actual voters.\r\n\r\nNow all the colored freemen in the slave States, and three fifths of the\r\nslaves, are represented, though none of them have votes. The States have\r\nnineteen representatives of colored slaves. If the slaves are now free\r\nthen they can add, for the other two fifths, thirteen more, making the\r\nslaves represented thirty-two. I suppose the free blacks in those States\r\nwill give at least five more, making the representation of non-voting\r\npeople of color about thirty-seven. The whole number of representatives\r\nnow from the slave States is seventy. Add the other two fifths and it\r\nwill be eighty-three.\r\n\r\nIf the amendment prevails, and those States withhold the right of\r\nsuffrage from persons of color, it will deduct about thirty-seven,\r\nleaving them but forty-six. With the basis unchanged, the eighty-three\r\nSouthern members, with the Democrats that will in the best times be\r\nelected from the North, will always give them a majority in Congress\r\nand in the Electoral College. They will at the very first election take\r\npossession of the White House and the halls of Congress. I need not\r\ndepict the ruin that would follow. Assumption of the rebel debt or\r\nrepudiation of the Federal debt would be sure to follow. The oppression\r\nof the freedmen, there--amendment of their State constitutions, and the\r\nreestablishment of slavery would be the inevitable result. That they\r\nwould scorn and disregard their present constitutions, forced upon them\r\nin the midst of martial law, would be both natural and just. No one who\r\nhas any regard for freedom of elections can look upon those governments,\r\nforced upon them in duress, with any favor. If they should grant the\r\nright of suffrage to persons of color, I think there would always be\r\nUnion white men enough in the South, aided by the blacks, to divide the\r\nrepresentation, and thus continue the Republican ascendency. If they\r\nshould refuse to thus alter their election laws it would reduce the\r\nrepresentatives of the late slave States to about forty-five and render\r\nthem powerless for evil.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that this amendment must be consummated before the defunct\r\nStates are admitted to be capable of State action, or it never can be.\r\n\r\nThe proposed amendment to allow Congress to lay a duty on exports\r\nis precisely in the same situation. Its importance cannot well be\r\noverstated. It is very obvious that for many years the South will not\r\npay much under our internal revenue laws. The only article on which we\r\ncan raise any considerable amount is cotton. It will be grown largely at\r\nonce. With ten cents a pound export duty it would be furnished cheaper\r\nto foreign markets than they could obtain it from any other part of the\r\nworld. The late war has shown that. Two million bales exported, at five\r\nhundred pounds to the bale, would yield $100,000,000. This seems to me\r\nthe chief revenue we shall ever derive from the South. Besides, it\r\nwould be a protection to that amount to our domestic manufactures.\r\nOther proposed amendments--to make all laws uniform; to prohibit the\r\nassumption of the rebel debt--are of vital importance, and the\r\nonly thing that can prevent the combined forces of copperheads and\r\nsecessionists from legislating against the interests of the Union\r\nwhenever they may obtain an accidental majority.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all that we ought to do before these inveterate rebels\r\nare invited to participate in our legislation. We have turned, or are\r\nabout to turn, loose four million of slaves without a hut to shelter\r\nthem, or a cent in their pockets. The infernal laws of slavery have\r\nprevented them from acquiring an education, understanding the commonest\r\nlaws of contract, or of managing the ordinary business of life. This\r\nCongress is bound to provide for them until they can take care of\r\nthemselves. If we do not furnish them with homesteads, and hedge them\r\naround with protective laws; if we leave them to the legislation of\r\ntheir late masters, we had better have left them in bondage. Their\r\ncondition would be worse than that of our prisoners at Andersonville. If\r\nwe fail in this great duty now, when we have the power, we shall deserve\r\nand receive the execration of history and of all future ages.\r\n\r\nTwo things are of vital importance.\r\n\r\n1. So to establish a principle that none of the rebel States shall be\r\ncounted in any of the amendments of the Constitution until they are\r\nduly admitted into the family of States by the law-making power of their\r\nconqueror. For more than six months the amendment of the Constitution\r\nabolishing slavery has been ratified by the Legislatures of three\r\nfourths of the States that acted on its passage by Congress, and which\r\nhad Legislatures, or which were States capable of acting, or required to\r\nact, on the question.\r\n\r\nI take no account of the aggregation of whitewashed rebels, who without\r\nany legal authority have assembled in the capitals of the late rebel\r\nStates and simulated legislative bodies. Nor do I regard with any\r\nrespect the cunning by-play into which they deluded the Secretary of\r\nState by frequent telegraphic announcements that \"South Carolina had\r\nadopted the amendment,\" \"Alabama has adopted the amendment, being the\r\ntwenty-seventh State,\" etc. This was intended to delude the people, and\r\naccustom Congress to hear repeated the names of these extinct States as\r\nif they were alive; when, in truth, they have no more existence than the\r\nrevolted cities of Latium, two thirds of whose people were colonized and\r\ntheir property confiscated, and their right of citizenship withdrawn by\r\nconquering and avenging Rome.\r\n\r\n2. It is equally important to the stability of this Republic that it\r\nshould now be solemnly decided what power can revive, recreate, and\r\nreinstate these provinces into the family of States, and invest them\r\nwith the rights of American citizens. It is time that Congress should\r\nassert its sovereignty, and assume something of the dignity of a Roman\r\nsenate. It is fortunate that the President invites Congress to take this\r\nmanly attitude. After stating with great frankness in his able message\r\nhis theory, which, however, is found to be impracticable, and which I\r\nbelieve very few now consider tenable, he refers the whole matter to\r\nthe judgment of Congress. If Congress should fail firmly and wisely to\r\ndischarge that high duty it is not the fault of the President.\r\n\r\nThis Congress owes it to its own character to set the seal of\r\nreprobation upon a doctrine which is becoming too fashionable, and\r\nunless rebuked will be the recognized principle of our Government.\r\nGovernor Perry and other provisional governors and orators proclaim\r\nthat \"this is the white man's Government.\" The whole copperhead party,\r\npandering to the lowest prejudices of the ignorant, repeat the cuckoo\r\ncry, \"This is the white man's Government.\" Demagogues of all parties,\r\neven some high in authority, gravely shout, \"This is the white man's\r\nGovernment.\" What is implied by this? That one race of men are to have\r\nthe exclusive right forever to rule this nation, and to exercise all\r\nacts of sovereignty, while all other races and nations and colors are to\r\nbe their subjects, and have no voice in making the laws and choosing the\r\nrulers by whom they are to be governed. Wherein does this differ from\r\nslavery except in degree? Does not this contradict all the distinctive\r\nprinciples of the Declaration of Independence? When the great and good\r\nmen promulgated that instrument, and pledged their lives and sacred\r\nhonors to defend it, it was supposed to form an epoch in civil\r\ngovernment. Before that time it was held that the right to rule was\r\nvested in families, dynasties, or races, not because of superior\r\nintelligence of virtue, but because of a divine right to enjoy exclusive\r\nprivileges.\r\n\r\nOur fathers repudiated the whole doctrine of the legal superiority of\r\nfamilies or races, and proclaimed the equality of men before the law.\r\nUpon that they created a revolution and built the Republic. They were\r\nprevented by slavery from perfecting the superstructure whose foundation\r\nthey had thus broadly laid. For the sake of the Union they consented to\r\nwait, but never relinquished the idea of its final completion. The time\r\nto which they looked forward with anxiety has come. It is our duty to\r\ncomplete their work. If this Republic is not now made to stand on their\r\ngreat principles, it has no honest foundation, and the Father of all men\r\nwill still shake it to its centre. If we have not yet been sufficiently\r\nscourged for our national sin to teach us to do justice to all God's\r\ncreatures, without distinction of race or color, we must expect the\r\nstill more heavy vengeance of an offended Father, still increasing his\r\ninflictions as he increased the severity of the plagues of Egypt until\r\nthe tyrant consented to do justice. And when that tyrant repented of\r\nhis reluctant consent, and attempted to re-enslave the people, as our\r\nsouthern tyrants are attempting to do now, he filled the Red Sea with\r\nbroken chariots and drowned horses, and strewed the shores with dead\r\ncarcasses.\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, I trust the Republican party will not be alarmed at what I\r\nam saying. I do not profess to speak their sentiments, nor must they\r\nbe held responsible for them. I speak for myself, and take the\r\nresponsibility, and will settle with my intelligent constituents.\r\n\r\nThis is not a \"white man's Government,\" in the exclusive sense in\r\nwhich it is used. To say so is political blasphemy, for it violates\r\nthe fundamental principles of our gospel of liberty. This is man's\r\nGovernment; the Government of all men alike; not that all men will have\r\nequal power and sway within it. Accidental circumstances, natural and\r\nacquired endowment and ability, will vary their fortunes. But equal\r\nrights to all the privileges of the Government is innate in every\r\nimmortal being, no matter what the shape or color of the tabernacle\r\nwhich it inhabits.\r\n\r\nIf equal privileges were granted to all, I should not expect any but\r\nwhite men to be elected to office for long ages to come. The prejudice\r\nengendered by slavery would not soon permit merit to be preferred\r\nto color. But it would still be beneficial to the weaker races. In a\r\ncountry where political divisions will always exist, their power,\r\njoined with just white men, would greatly modify, if it did not entirely\r\nprevent, the injustice of majorities. Without the right of suffrage in\r\nthe late slave States (I do not speak of the free States), I believe the\r\nslaves had far better been left in bondage. I see it stated that very\r\ndistinguished advocates of the right of suffrage lately declared in this\r\ncity that they do not expect to obtain it by congressional legislation,\r\nbut only by administrative action, because, as one gallant gentleman\r\nsaid, the States had not been out of the Union. Then they will never get\r\nit. The President is far sounder than they. He sees that administrative\r\naction has nothing to do with it. If it ever is to come, it must be by\r\nconstitutional amendments or congressional action in the Territories,\r\nand in enabling acts.\r\n\r\nHow shameful that men of influence should mislead and miseducate the\r\npublic mind! They proclaim, \"This is the white man's Government,\" and\r\nthe whole coil of copperheads echo the same sentiment, and upstart,\r\njealous Republicans join the cry. Is it any wonder ignorant foreigners\r\nand illiterate natives should learn this doctrine, and be led to despise\r\nand maltreat a whole race of their fellow-men?\r\n\r\nSir, this doctrine of a white man's Government is as atrocious as the\r\ninfamous sentiment that damned the late Chief-Justice to everlasting\r\nfame; and, I fear, to everlasting fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY J. RAYMOND,\r\n\r\nOF NEW YORK. (BORN 1820, DIED 1869.)\r\n\r\nON RECONSTRUCTION; CONSERVATIVE, OR ADMINISTRATION, REPUBLICAN OPINION;\r\n\r\nIN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, DECEMBER 21, 1865.\r\n\r\nI need not say that I have been gratified to hear many things which have\r\nfallen from the lips of the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Finck), who has\r\njust taken his seat. I have no party feeling, nor any other feeling,\r\nwhich would prevent me from rejoicing in the indications apparent on\r\nthat side of the House of a purpose to concur with the loyal people of\r\nthe country, and with the loyal administration of the Government, and\r\nwith the loyal majorities in both Houses of Congress, in restoring peace\r\nand order to our common country. I cannot, perhaps, help wishing,\r\nsir, that these indications of an interest in the preservation of our\r\nGovernment had come somewhat sooner. I cannot help feeling that such\r\nexpressions cannot now be of as much service to the country as they\r\nmight once have been. If we could have had from that side of the House\r\nsuch indications of an interest in the preservation of the Union,\r\nsuch heartfelt sympathy with the efforts of the Government for the\r\npreservation of that Union, such hearty denunciation of those who were\r\nseeking its destruction, while the war was raging, I am sure we might\r\nhave been spared some years of war, some millions of money, and rivers\r\nof blood and tears.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, I am not disposed to fight over again battles now happily\r\nended. I feel, and I am rejoiced to find that members on the other side\r\nof the House feel, that the great problem now before us is to restore\r\nthe Union to its old integrity, purified from everything that interfered\r\nwith the full development of the spirit of liberty which it was made\r\nto enshrine. I trust that we shall have a general concurrence of the\r\nmembers of this House and of this Congress in such measures as may be\r\ndeemed most fit and proper for the accomplishment of that result. I am\r\nglad to assume and to believe that there is not a member of this House,\r\nnor a man in this country, who does not wish, from the bottom of his\r\nheart, to see the day speedily come when we shall have this nation--the\r\ngreat American Republic--again united, more harmonious in its action\r\nthan it ever has been, and forever one and indivisible. We in this\r\nCongress are to devise the means to restore its union and its harmony,\r\nto perfect its institutions, and to make it in all its parts and in all\r\nits action, through all time to come, too strong, too wise, and too\r\nfree ever to invite or ever to permit the hand of rebellion again to be\r\nraised against it.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, in devising those ways and means to accomplish that great\r\nresult, the first thing we have to do is to know the point from which\r\nwe start, to understand the nature of the material with which we have\r\nto work--the condition of the territory and the States with which we are\r\nconcerned. I had supposed at the outset of this session that it was the\r\npurpose of this House to proceed to that work without discussion, and\r\nto commit it almost exclusively, if not entirely, to the joint committee\r\nraised by the two Houses for the consideration of that subject. But,\r\nsir, I must say that I was glad when I perceived the distinguished\r\ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Stevens), himself the chairman on the\r\npart of this House of that great committee on reconstruction, lead off\r\nin a discussion of this general subject, and thus invite all the rest of\r\nus who choose to follow him in the debate. In the remarks which he made\r\nin this body a few days since, he laid down, with the clearness and\r\nthe force which characterize everything he says and does, his point of\r\ndeparture in commencing this great work. I had hoped that the ground he\r\nwould lay down would be such that we could all of us stand upon it and\r\nco-operate with him in our common object. I feel constrained to say,\r\nsir--and do it without the slightest disposition to create or to\r\nexaggerate differences--that there were features in his exposition of\r\nthe condition of the country with which I cannot concur. I cannot for\r\nmyself start from precisely the point which he assumes.\r\n\r\nIn his remarks on that occasion he assumed that the States lately in\r\nrebellion were and are out of the Union. Throughout his speech--I will\r\nnot trouble you with reading passages from it--I find him speaking of\r\nthose States as \"outside of the Union,\" as \"dead States,\" as having\r\nforfeited all their rights and terminated their State existence. I find\r\nexpressions still more definite and distinct; I find him stating that\r\nthey \"are and for four years have been out of the Union for all legal\r\npurposes\"; as having been for four years a \"separate power,\" and \"a\r\nseparate nation.\"\r\n\r\nHis position therefore is that these States, having been in rebellion,\r\nare now out of the Union, and are simply within the jurisdiction of the\r\nConstitution of the United States as so much territory to be dealt with\r\nprecisely as the will of the conqueror, to use his own language, may\r\ndictate. Now, sir, if that position is correct, it prescribes for us one\r\nline of policy to be pursued very different from the one that will be\r\nproper if it is not correct. His belief is that what we have to do is to\r\ncreate new States out of this territory at the proper time--many\r\nyears distant--retaining them meantime in a territorial condition, and\r\nsubjecting them to precisely such a state of discipline and tutelage\r\nas Congress or the Government of the United States may see fit to\r\nprescribe. If I believed in the premises which he assumes, possibly,\r\nthough I do not think probably, I might agree with the conclusion he has\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, I cannot believe that this is our condition. I cannot believe\r\nthat these States have ever been out of the Union, or that they are now\r\nout of the Union. I cannot believe that they ever have been, or are now,\r\nin any sense a separate Power. If they were, sir, how and when did they\r\nbecome so? They were once States of this Union--that every one concedes;\r\nbound to the Union and made members of the Union by the Constitution\r\nof the United States. If they ever went out of the Union it was at some\r\nspecific time and by some specific act. I regret that the gentleman from\r\nPennsylvania (Mr. Stevens) is not now in his seat. I should have been\r\nglad to ask him by what specific act, and at what precise time, any one\r\nof those States took itself out of the American Union. Was it by the\r\nordinance of secession? I think we all agree that an ordinance of\r\nsecession passed by any State of this Union is simply a nullity, because\r\nit encounters in its practical operation the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, which is the supreme law of the land. It could have no legal,\r\nactual force or validity. It could not operate to effect any actual\r\nchange in the relations of the State adopting it to the national\r\nGovernment, still less to accomplish the removal of that State from the\r\nsovereign jurisdiction of the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nWell, sir, did the resolutions of the States, the declarations of\r\ntheir officials, the speeches of members of their Legislatures, or the\r\nutterances of their press accomplish the result? Certainly not. They\r\ncould not possibly work any change whatever in the relations of these\r\nStates to the General Government. All their ordinances and all their\r\nresolutions were simply declarations of a purpose to secede. Their\r\nsecession, if it ever took place, certainly could not date from the time\r\nwhen their intention to secede was first announced. After declaring\r\nthat intention, they proceeded to carry it into effect. How? By war.\r\nBy sustaining their purpose by arms against the force which the United\r\nStates brought to bear against it. Did they sustain it? Were their arms\r\nvictorious? If they were, then their secession was an accomplished\r\nfact. If not, it was nothing more than an abortive attempt--a purpose\r\nunfulfilled. This, then, is simply a question of fact, and we all know\r\nwhat the fact is. They did not succeed. They failed to maintain their\r\nground by force of arms--in other words, they failed to secede.\r\n\r\nBut the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Stevens) insists that they did\r\nsecede, and that this fact is not in the least affected by the other\r\nfact that the Constitution forbids secession. He says that the law\r\nforbids murder, but that murders are nevertheless committed. But there\r\nis no analogy between the two cases. If secession had been accomplished,\r\nif these States had gone out, and overcome the armies that tried to\r\nprevent their going out, then the prohibition of the Constitution could\r\nnot have altered the fact. In the case of murder the man is killed, and\r\nmurder is thus committed in spite of the law. The fact of killing is\r\nessential to the committal of the crime; and the fact of going out is\r\nessential to secession. But in this case there was no such fact. I think\r\nI need not argue any further the position that the rebel States\r\nhave never for one moment, by any ordinances of secession, or by any\r\nsuccessful war, carried themselves beyond the rightful jurisdiction of\r\nthe Constitution of the United States. They have interrupted for a\r\ntime the practical enforcement and exercise of that jurisdiction;\r\nthey rendered it impossible for a time for this Government to enforce\r\nobedience to its laws; but there has never been an hour when this\r\nGovernment, or this Congress, or this House, or the gentleman from\r\nPennsylvania himself, ever conceded that those States were beyond the\r\njurisdiction of the Constitution and laws of the United States.\r\n\r\nDuring all these four years of war Congress has been making laws for the\r\ngovernment of those very States, and the gentleman from Pennsylvania has\r\nvoted for them, and voted to raise armies to enforce them. Why was this\r\ndone if they were a separate nation? Why, if they were not part of the\r\nUnited States? Those laws were made for them as States. Members have\r\nvoted for laws imposing upon them direct taxes, which are apportioned,\r\naccording to the Constitution, only \"among the several States\" according\r\nto their population. In a variety of ways--to some of which the\r\ngentleman' who preceded me has referred--this Congress has, by its\r\naction, assumed and asserted that they were still States in the Union,\r\nthough in rebellion, and that it was with the rebellion that we were\r\nmaking war, and not with the States themselves as States, and still less\r\nas a separate, as a foreign Power.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWhy, sir, if there be no constitution of any sort in a State, no\r\nlaw, nothing but chaos, then that State would no longer exist as an\r\norganization. But that has not been the case, it never is the case\r\nin great communities, for they always have constitutions and forms of\r\ngovernment. It may not be a constitution or form of government adapted\r\nto its relation to the Government of the United States; and that would\r\nbe an evil to be remedied by the Government of the United States. That\r\nis what we have been trying to do for the last four years. The practical\r\nrelations of the governments of those States with the Government of\r\nthe United States were all wrong--were hostile to that Government. They\r\ndenied our jurisdiction, and they denied that they were States of the\r\nUnion, but their denial did not change the fact; and there was never any\r\ntime when their organizations as States were destroyed. A dead State is\r\na solecism, a contradiction in terms, an impossibility.\r\n\r\nThese are, I confess, rather metaphysical distinctions, but I did not\r\nraise them. Those who assert that a State is destroyed whenever its\r\nconstitution is changed, or whenever its practical relations with\r\nthis Government are changed, must be held responsible for whatever\r\nmetaphysical niceties may be necessarily involved in the discussion.\r\n\r\nI do not know, sir, that I have made my views on this point clear to the\r\ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelley), who has questioned me upon it,\r\nand I am still more doubtful whether, even if they are intelligible, he\r\nwill concur with me as to their justice. But I regard these States as\r\njust as truly within the jurisdiction of the Constitution, and therefore\r\njust as really and truly States of the American Union now as they were\r\nbefore the war. Their practical relations to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States have been disturbed, and we have been endeavoring, through\r\nfour years of war, to restore them and make them what they were before\r\nthe war. The victory in the field has given us the means of doing this;\r\nwe can now re-establish the practical relations of those States to\r\nthe Government. Our actual jurisdiction over them, which they vainly\r\nattempted to throw off, is already restored. The conquest we have\r\nachieved is a conquest over the rebellion, not a conquest over the\r\nStates whose authority the rebellion had for a time subverted.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I think the views submitted by the gentleman from\r\nPennsylvania (Mr. Stevens) upon this point are unsound. Let me next\r\ncite some of the consequences which, it seems to me, must follow the\r\nacceptance of his position. If, as he asserts, we have been waging war\r\nwith an independent Power, with a separate nation, I cannot see how we\r\ncan talk of treason in connection with our recent conflict, or demand\r\nthe execution of Davis or anybody else as a traitor. Certainly if we\r\nwere at war with any other foreign Power we should not talk of the\r\ntreason of those who were opposed to us in the field. If we were engaged\r\nin a war with France and should take as prisoner the Emperor Napoleon,\r\ncertainly we would not talk of him as a traitor or as liable to\r\nexecution. I think that by adopting any such assumption as that of the\r\nhonorable gentleman, we surrender the whole idea of treason and the\r\npunishment of traitors. I think, moreover, that we accept, virtually and\r\npractically, the doctrine of State sovereignty, the right of a State to\r\nwithdraw from the Union, and to break up the Union at its own will\r\nand pleasure. I do not see how upon those premises we can escape that\r\nconclusion. If the States that engaged in the late rebellion constituted\r\nthemselves, by their ordinances of secession or by any of the acts with\r\nwhich they followed those ordinances, a separate and independent Power,\r\nI do not see how we can deny the principles on which they professed\r\nto act, or refuse assent to their practical results. I have heard no\r\nclearer, no stronger statement of the doctrine of State sovereignty as\r\nparamount to the sovereignty of the nation than would be involved in\r\nsuch a concession. Whether he intended it or not, the gentleman from\r\nPennsylvania (Mr. Stevens) actually assents to the extreme doctrines of\r\nthe advocates of secession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHADDEUS STEVENS,\r\n\r\nOF PENNSYLVANIA. (BORN 1792, DIED 1868.)\r\n\r\nON THE FIRST RECONSTRUCTION BILL;\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, JANUARY 3, 1867\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. SPEAKER:\r\n\r\nWhat are the great questions which now divide the nation? In the midst\r\nof the political Babel which has been produced by the intermingling\r\nof secessionists, rebels, pardoned traitors, hissing Copperheads, and\r\napostate Republicans, such a confusion of tongues is heard that it\r\nis difficult to understand either the questions that are asked or the\r\nanswers that are given. Ask what is the \"President's policy,\" and it is\r\ndifficult to define it. Ask what is the \"policy of Congress,\" and the\r\nanswer is not always at hand. A few moments may be profitably spent in\r\nseeking the meaning of each of these terms.\r\n\r\nIn this country the whole sovereignty rests with the people, and is\r\nexercised through their Representatives in Congress assembled. The\r\nlegislative power is the sole guardian of that sovereignty. No other\r\nbranch of the government, no other department, no other officer of the\r\ngovernment, possesses one single particle of the sovereignty of the\r\nnation. No government official, from the President and Chief-Justice\r\ndown, can do any one act which is not prescribed and directed by the\r\nlegislative power. Suppose the government were now to be organized\r\nfor the first time under the Constitution, and the President had\r\nbeen elected, and the judiciary appointed; what could either do until\r\nCongress passed laws to regulate their proceedings? What power would\r\nthe President have over any one subject of government until Congress had\r\nlegislated on that subject? * * * The President could not even create\r\nbureaus or departments to facilitate his executive operations. He must\r\nask leave of Congress. Since, then, the President cannot enact, alter,\r\nor modify a single law; cannot even create a petty office within his\r\nown sphere of operations; if, in short, he is the mere servant of the\r\npeople, who issue their commands to him through Congress, whence does\r\nhe derive the constitutional power to create new States, to remodel old\r\nones, to dictate organic laws, to fix the qualifications of voters, to\r\ndeclare that States are republican and entitled to command Congress, to\r\nadmit their Representatives? To my mind it is either the most ignorant\r\nand shallow mistake of his duties, or the most brazen and impudent\r\nusurpation of power. It is claimed for him by some as commander-in-chief\r\nof the army and navy. How absurd that a mere executive officer should\r\nclaim creative powers. Though commander-in-chief by the Constitution,\r\nhe would have nothing to command, either by land or water until Congress\r\nraised both army and navy. Congress also prescribes the rules\r\nand regulations to govern the army; even that is not left to the\r\nCommander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nThough the President is commander-in-chief, Congress is his commander;\r\nand, God willing, he shall obey. He and his minions shall learn that\r\nthis is not a government of kings and satraps, but a government of\r\nthe people, and that Congress is the people. * * * To reconstruct the\r\nnation, to admit new States, to guarantee republican governments to\r\nold States, are all legislative acts. The President claims the right to\r\nexercise them. Congress denies it, and asserts the right to belong to\r\nthe legislative branch. They have determined to defend these rights\r\nagainst all usurpers. They have determined that, while in their keeping,\r\nthe Constitution shall not be violated with impunity. This I take to\r\nbe the great question between the President and Congress. He claims the\r\nright to reconstruct by his own power. Congress denies him all power in\r\nthe matter except that of advice, and has determined to maintain such\r\ndenial. \"My policy\" asserts full power in the Executive. The policy of\r\nCongress forbids him to exercise any power therein.\r\n\r\nBeyond this I do not agree that the \"policy\" of the parties is defined.\r\nTo be sure, many subordinate items of the policy of each may be easily\r\nsketched. The President * * * desires that the traitors (having sternly\r\nexecuted that most important leader Rickety Wirz, as a high example)\r\nshould be exempt from further fine, imprisonment, forfeiture, exile, or\r\ncapital punishment, and be declared entitled to all the rights of\r\nloyal citizens. He desires that the States created by him shall be\r\nacknowledged as valid States, while at the same time he inconsistently\r\ndeclares that the old rebel States are in full existence, and always\r\nhave been, and have equal rights with the loyal States. He opposes the\r\namendment to the Constitution which changes the basis of representation,\r\nand desires the old slave States to have the benefit of their increase\r\nof freemen without increasing the number of votes; in short, he desires\r\nto make the vote of one rebel in South Carolina equal to the votes of\r\nthree freemen in Pennsylvania or New York. He is determined to force\r\na solid rebel delegation into Congress from the South, which, together\r\nwith Northern Copperheads, could at once control Congress and elect all\r\nfuture Presidents.\r\n\r\nCongress refuses to treat the States created by him as of any validity,\r\nand denies that the old rebel States have any existence which gives\r\nthem any rights under the Constitution. Congress insists on changing the\r\nbasis of representation so as to put white voters on an equality in both\r\nsections, and that such change shall precede the admission of any\r\nState. * * * Congress denies that any State lately in rebellion has\r\nany government or constitution known to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, or which can be recognized as a part of the Union. How, then,\r\ncan such a State adopt the (XIIIth) amendment? To allow it would be\r\nyielding the whole question, and admitting the unimpaired rights of the\r\nseceded States. I know of no Republican who does not ridicule what\r\nMr. Seward thought a cunning movement, in counting Virginia and other\r\noutlawed States among those which had adopted the constitutional\r\namendment abolishing slavery.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that inconsiderate and incautious Republicans\r\nshould ever have supposed that the slight amendments already proposed\r\nto the Constitution, even when incorporated into that instrument, would\r\nsatisfy the reforms necessary for the security of the government. Unless\r\nthe rebel States, before admission, should be made republican in spirit,\r\nand placed under the guardianship of loyal men, all our blood and\r\ntreasure will have been spent in vain. * * *\r\n\r\nThe law of last session with regard to Territories settled the\r\nprinciples of such acts. Impartial suffrage, both in electing the\r\ndelegates and in ratifying their proceedings, is now the fixed rule.\r\nThere is more reason why colored voters should be admitted in the rebel\r\nStates than in the Territories. In the States they form the great mass\r\nof the loyal men. Possibly, with their aid, loyal governments may be\r\nestablished in most of those States. Without it all are sure to be ruled\r\nby traitors; and loyal men, black or white, will be oppressed, exiled,\r\nor murdered.\r\n\r\nThere are several good reasons for the passage of this bill. In the\r\nfirst place, it is just. I am now confining my argument to negro\r\nsuffrage in the rebel States. Have not loyal blacks quite as good a\r\nright to choose rulers and make laws as rebel whites? In the second\r\nplace, it is a necessity in order to protect the loyal white men in\r\nthe seceded States. With them the blacks would act in a body; and it is\r\nbelieved then, in each of said States, except one, the two united would\r\nform a majority, control the States, and protect themselves. Now they\r\nare the victims of daily murder. They must suffer constant persecution\r\nor be exiled.\r\n\r\nAnother good reason is that it would insure the ascendency of the Union\r\nparty. \"Do you avow the party purpose?\" exclaims some horror-stricken\r\ndemagogue. I do. For I believe, on my conscience, that on the continued\r\nascendency of that party depends the safety of this great nation. If\r\nimpartial suffrage is excluded in the rebel States, then every one of\r\nthem is sure to send a solid rebel representation to Congress, and cast\r\na solid rebel electoral vote. They, with their kindred Copperheads of\r\nthe North, would always elect the President and control Congress. While\r\nslavery sat upon her defiant throne, and insulted and intimidated the\r\ntrembling North, the South frequently divided on questions of policy\r\nbetween Whigs and Democrats, and gave victory alternately to the\r\nsections. Now, you must divide them between loyalists, without regard\r\nto color, and disloyalists, or you will be the perpetual vassals of the\r\nfree-trade, irritated, revengeful South. For these, among other reasons,\r\nI am for negro suffrage in every rebel State. If it be just, it should\r\nnot be denied; if it be necessary, it should be adopted; if it be a\r\npunishment to traitors, they deserve it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--FREE TRADE AND PROTECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE periods into which this series has been divided will furnish,\r\nperhaps, some key to the brief summary of tariff discussion in the\r\nUnited States which follows. For it is not at all true that tariff\r\ndiscussion or decision has been isolated; on the contrary, it has\r\ninfluenced, and been influenced by, every other phase of the national\r\ndevelopment of the country.\r\n\r\nBancroft has laid none too great stress on the influence of the English\r\nmercantile system in forcing the American Revolution, and on the\r\nattitude of the Revolution as an organized revolt against the English\r\nsystem. One of the first steps by which the Continental Congress\r\nasserted its claim to independent national action was the throwing\r\nopen of American ports to the commerce of all nations--that is, to free\r\ntrade. It should, however, be added that the extreme breadth of this\r\nliberality was due to the inability of Congress to impose any duties on\r\nimports; it had a choice only between absolute prohibition and absolute\r\nfree trade, and it chose the latter. The States were not so limited.\r\nBoth under the revolutionary Congress and under the Confederation they\r\nretained the entire duty power, and they showed no fondness for free\r\ntrade. Commerce in general was light, and tariff receipts, even in the\r\ncommercial States, were of no great importance; but, wherever it\r\nwas possible, commercial regulations were framed in disregard of the\r\nfree-trade principle. In order to retain the trade in firewood and\r\nvegetables within her own borders, New York, in 1787, even laid\r\nprohibitory duties on Connecticut and New Jersey boats; and retaliatory\r\nmeasures were begun by the two States attacked.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution gave to Congress, and forbade to the States, the power\r\nto regulate commerce. As soon as the Constitution came to be put into\r\noperation, the manner and objects of the regulation of commerce by\r\nCongress became a public question. Many other considerations were\r\ncomplicated with it. It was necessary for the United States to obtain\r\na revenue, and this could most easily be done by a tariff of duties on\r\nimports. It was necessary for the Federalist majority to consider the\r\nparty interests both in the agricultural States, which would object\r\nto protective duties, and in the States which demanded them. But the\r\nhighest consideration in the mind of Hamilton and the most influential\r\nleaders of the party seems to have been the maintenance of the\r\nUnion. The repulsive force of the States toward one another was still\r\nsufficiently strong to be an element of constant and recognized danger\r\nto the Union. One method of overcoming it, as a part of the whole\r\nHamiltonian policy, was to foster the growth of manufactures as an\r\ninterest entirely independent of State lines and dependent on the\r\nnational government, which would throw its whole influence for the\r\nmaintenance of the Union. This feeling runs through the speeches even of\r\nMadison, who prefaced his remarks by a declaration in favor of \"a trade\r\nas free as the policy of nations would allow.\" Protection, therefore,\r\nbegan in the United States as an instrument of national unity, without\r\nregard to national profit; and the argument in its favor would have been\r\nquite as strong as ever to the mind of a legislator who accepted every\r\ndeduction as to the economic disadvantages of protection. Arguments for\r\nits economic advantages are not wanting; but they have no such form and\r\nconsistency as those of subsequent periods. The result of the discussion\r\nwas the tariff act of July 4, 1789, whose preamble stated one of its\r\nobjects to be \"the encouragement and protection of manufactures.\" Its\r\naverage duty, however, was but about 8.5 per cent. It was followed by\r\nother acts, each increasing the rate of general duties, until, at the\r\noutbreak of the War of 1812, the general rate was about 21 per cent. The\r\nwar added about 6 per cent, to this rate.\r\n\r\nGrowth toward democracy very commonly brings a curious bias toward\r\nprotection, contrasted with the fundamental free-trade argument that a\r\nprotective system and a system of slave labor have identical bases. The\r\nbias toward a pronounced protective system in the United States makes\r\nits appearance with the rise of democracy; and, after the War of 1812,\r\nis complicated with party interests. New England was still the citadel\r\nof Federalism. The war and its blockade had fostered manufactures in New\r\nEngland; and the manufacturing interest, looking to the Democratic\r\nparty for protection, was a possible force to sap the foundations of the\r\ncitadel. Dallas, of Pennsylvania, Secretary of the Treasury, prepared,\r\nand Calhoun carried through Congress, the tariff of 1816. It introduced\r\nseveral protective features, the \"minimum\" feature, by which the\r\nimported article was assumed to have cost at least a certain amount in\r\ncalculating duties, and positive protection for cottons and woollens.\r\nThe duties paid under this tariff were about 30 per cent. on all\r\nimports, or 33 per cent. on dutiable goods. In 1824 and 1828, under the\r\nlead of Clay, tariffs were adopted which made the tariff of duties still\r\nhigher and more systematically protective; they touched high-water\r\nmark in 1830, being 40 per cent. on all imports, or 48.8 per cent. on\r\ndutiable goods. The influence of nullification in forcing through the\r\ncompromise tariff of 1833, with its regular decrease of duties for ten\r\nyears, has been stated in the first volume.\r\n\r\nUnder the workings of the compromise tariff there was a steady decrease\r\nin the rate on all imports, but not in the rate on dutiable goods, the\r\ncomparison being 22 per cent. on total to 32 per cent. on dutiable for\r\n1833, and 16 per cent. on total to 32 per cent. on dutiable for 1841.\r\nThe conjunction of the increase in non-dutiable imports and the approach\r\nof free trade, with general financial distress, gave the Whigs\r\nsuccess in the elections of 1840; and in 1841 they set about reviving\r\nprotection. Unluckily for them, their chosen President, Harrison, was\r\ndead, and his successor, Tyler, a Democrat by nature, taken up for\r\npolitical reasons by the Whigs, was deaf to Whig eloquence on the\r\nsubject of the tariff. After an unsuccessful effort to secure a\r\nhigh tariff and a distribution of the surplus among the States, the\r\nsemi-protective tariff of 1842 became law. Its result for the next four\r\nyears was that the rate on dutiable goods was altered very little, while\r\nthe rate on total imports rose from 16 per cent. to 26 per cent. The\r\nreturn of the Democrats to power was marked by the passage of the\r\nrevenue tariff of 1846, which lasted, with a slight further reduction\r\nof duties in 1857, until 1861. Under its operation the rates steadily\r\ndecreased until, in 1861, they were 18.14 per cent, on dutiable goods,\r\nand 11.79 per cent. on total imports.\r\n\r\nThe platform of the Republican party in the election of 1856 made no\r\ndeclaration for or against free trade or protection. The results of the\r\nelection showed that the electoral votes of Pennsylvania and Illinois\r\nwould have been sufficient to give the party a victory in 1856. Both\r\nparty policy and a natural regard to its strong Whig membership dictated\r\na return to the protective feature of the Whig policy. In March,\r\n1860, Mr. Morrill introduced a protective tariff bill in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and it passed that body; and, in June, the Republican\r\nNational Convention adopted, as one of its resolutions, a declaration\r\nin favor of a protective system. The Democratic Senate postponed the\r\nMorrill bill until the following session. When it came up again\r\nfor consideration, in February, 1861, conditions had changed very\r\nconsiderably. Seven States had seceded, taking off fourteen Senators\r\nopposed to the bill; and it was passed. It was signed by President\r\nBuchanan, March 2, 1861, and went into operation April 1, raising the\r\nrates to about 20 per cent. In August and in December, two other acts\r\nwere passed, raising the rates still higher. These were followed by\r\nother increases, which ran the maximum up, in 1868, to 48 per cent. on\r\ndutiable goods, the highest rate from 1860 to date. It may be noted,\r\nhowever, that the rate of 1830--48.8 per cent. on dutiable goods--still\r\nretains its rank as the highest in our history.\r\n\r\nThe controlling necessity for ready money, to prevent the over-issue of\r\nbonds and green-backs, undoubtedly gained votes in Congress sufficient\r\nto sustain the policy of protection, as a means of putting the capital\r\nof the country into positions where it could be easily reached by\r\ninternal-revenue taxation. This conjunction of internal revenue and\r\nprotection proved a mutual support until the payment of the war debt\r\nhad gone so far as to provoke the reaction. The Democratic National\r\nConvention of 1876 attacked the tariff system as a masterpiece of\r\niniquity, but no distinct issue was made between the parties on this\r\nquestion. In 1880 and 1884, the Republican party was the one to force\r\nthe issue of protection or free trade upon its opponent, but its\r\nopponent evaded it.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, both parties admit the necessity of a reduction in the rates\r\nof duties, if for no other reason, in order to reduce the surplus of\r\nGovernment receipts over expenditures, which is a constant stimulus\r\nto congressional extravagance. The Republican policy is in general\r\nto retain the principle of protection in the reduction; while the\r\nDemocratic policy, so far as it is defined, is to deal as tenderly as\r\npossible with interests which have become vested under a protective\r\nsystem. What influence will be exerted by the present over-production\r\nand depression in business cannot, of course, be foretold; but the\r\nreport of Mr. McCulloch, Secretary of the Treasury, in December, 1884,\r\nindicates an attempt to induce manufacturers to submit to an abandonment\r\nof protection, as a means of securing a decrease in cost of production,\r\nand a consequent foreign market for surplus product.\r\n\r\nIn taking Clay's speech in 1832 as the representative statement of the\r\nargument for protection, the editor has consulted Professor Thompson,\r\nof the University of Pennsylvania, and has been guided by his advice. On\r\nthe other side, the statement of Representative Hurd, in 1881, has been\r\ntaken as, on the whole, the best summary of the free-trade argument. In\r\nboth cases, the difficulty has been in the necessary exclusion of merely\r\nwritten arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY CLAY,\r\n\r\nOF KENTUCKY. (BORN 1777, DIED 1852.)\r\n\r\nON THE AMERICAN SYSTEM;\r\n\r\nIN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, FEBRUARY 2-6, 1832.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE question which we are now called upon to determine, is not, whether\r\nwe shall establish a new and doubtful system of policy, just proposed,\r\nand for the first time presented to our consideration, but whether we\r\nshall break down and destroy a long-established system, carefully and\r\npatiently built up and sanctioned, during a series of years, again and\r\nagain, by the nation and its highest and most revered authorities. And\r\nare we not bound deliberately to consider whether we can proceed to this\r\nwork of destruction without a violation of the public faith? The people\r\nof the United States have justly supposed that the policy of protecting\r\ntheir industry against foreign legislation and foreign industry was\r\nfully settled, not by a single act, but by repeated and deliberate acts\r\nof government, performed at distant and frequent intervals. In full\r\nconfidence that the policy was firmly and unchangeably fixed, thousands\r\nupon thousands have invested their capital, purchased a vast amount of\r\nreal and other estate, made permanent establishments, and accommodated\r\ntheir industry. Can we expose to utter and irretrievable ruin this\r\ncountless multitude, without justly incurring the reproach of violating\r\nthe national faith? * * *\r\n\r\nWhen gentlemen have succeeded in their design of an immediate or gradual\r\ndestruction of the American system, what is their substitute? Free\r\ntrade! The call for free trade is as unavailing, as the cry of a spoiled\r\nchild in its nurse's arms, for the moon, or the stars that glitter in\r\nthe firmament of heaven. It never has existed, it never will exist.\r\nTrade implies at least two parties. To be free, it should be fair,\r\nequal, and reciprocal. But if we throw our ports wide open to the\r\nadmission of foreign productions, free of all duty, what ports of any\r\nother foreign nation shall we find open to the free admission of our\r\nsurplus produce? We may break down all barriers to free trade on our\r\npart, but the work will not be complete until foreign powers shall have\r\nremoved theirs. There would be freedom on one side, and restrictions,\r\nprohibitions, and exclusions on the other. The bolts and the bars and\r\nthe chains of all other nations will remain undisturbed. It is, indeed,\r\npossible, that our industry and commerce would accommodate themselves to\r\nthis unequal and unjust state of things; for, such is the flexibility\r\nof our nature, that it bends itself to all circumstances. The wretched\r\nprisoner incarcerated in a jail, after a long time, becomes reconciled\r\nto his solitude, and regularly notches down the passing days of his\r\nconfinement.\r\n\r\nGentlemen deceive themselves. It is not free trade that they are\r\nrecommending to our acceptance. It is, in effect, the British colonial\r\nsystem that we are invited to adopt; and, if their policy prevails, it\r\nwill lead substantially to the recolonization of these States, under the\r\ncommercial dominion of Great Britain. * * *\r\n\r\nI dislike this resort to authority, and especially foreign and\r\ninterested authority, for the support of principles of public policy. I\r\nwould greatly prefer to meet gentlemen upon the broad ground of fact, of\r\nexperience, and of reason; but, since they will appeal to British names\r\nand authority, I feel myself compelled to imitate their bad example.\r\nAllow me to quote from the speech of a member of the British Parliament,\r\nbearing the same family name with my Lord Goderich, but whether or not\r\na relation of his, I do not know. The member alluded to was arguing\r\nagainst the violation of the treaty of Methuen--that treaty not less\r\nfatal to the interests of Portugal than would be the system of gentlemen\r\nto the best interests of America,--and he went on to say:\r\n\r\n\"It was idle for us to endeavor to persuade other nations to join with\r\nus in adopting the principles of what was called 'free trade.' Other\r\nnations knew, as well as the noble lord opposite, and those who acted\r\nwith him, what we meant by 'free trade' was nothing more nor less than,\r\nby means of the great advantages we enjoyed, to get a monopoly of all\r\ntheir markets for our manufactures, and to prevent them, one and all,\r\nfrom ever becoming manufacturing nations. When the system of reciprocity\r\nand free trade had been proposed to a French ambassador, his remark was,\r\nthat the plan was excellent in theory, but, to make it fair in practice,\r\nit would be necessary to defer the attempt to put it in execution for\r\nhalf a century, until France should be on the same footing with Great\r\nBritain, in marine, in manufactures, in capital, and the many other\r\npeculiar advantages which it now enjoyed. The policy that France acted\r\non was that of encouraging its native manufactures, and it was a wise\r\npolicy; because, if it were freely to admit our manufactures, it would\r\nspeedily be reduced to the rank of an agricultural nation, and therefore\r\na poor nation, as all must be that depend exclusively upon agriculture.\r\nAmerica acted, too, upon the same principle with France. America\r\nlegislated for futurity--legislated for an increasing population.\r\nAmerica, too, was prospering under this system. In twenty years, America\r\nwould be independent of England for manufactures altogether. * * * But\r\nsince the peace, France, Germany, America, and all the other countries\r\nof the world, had proceeded upon the principle of encouraging and\r\nprotecting native manufacturers.\" * * *\r\n\r\nI regret, Mr. President, that one topic has, I think, unnecessarily been\r\nintroduced into this, debate. I allude to the charge brought against the\r\nmanufacturing system, as favoring the growth of aristocracy. If it were\r\ntrue, would gentlemen prefer supporting foreign accumulations of wealth\r\nby that description of industry, rather than in their own country? But\r\nis it correct? The joint-stock companies of the North, as I understand\r\nthem, are nothing more than associations, sometimes of hundreds, by\r\nmeans of which the small earnings of many are brought into a common\r\nstock, and the associates, obtaining corporate privileges, are enabled\r\nto prosecute, under one superintending head, their business to better\r\nadvantage. Nothing can be more essentially democratic or better devised\r\nto counterpoise the influence of individual wealth. In Kentucky, almost\r\nevery manufactory known to me is in the hands of enterprising and\r\nself-made men, who have acquired whatever wealth they possess by patient\r\nand diligent labor. Comparisons are odious, and but in defence would\r\nnot be made by me. But is there more tendency to aristocracy in a\r\nmanufactory, supporting hundreds of freemen, or in a cotton plantation,\r\nwith its not less numerous slaves, sustaining perhaps only two white\r\nfamilies--that of the master and the overseer?\r\n\r\nI pass, with pleasure, from this disagreeable topic, to two general\r\npropositions which cover the entire ground of debate. The first is,\r\nthat, under the operation of the American system, the objects which it\r\nprotects and fosters are brought to the consumer at cheaper prices than\r\nthey commanded prior to its introduction, or, than they would command if\r\nit did not exist. If that be true, ought not the country to be contented\r\nand satisfied with the system, unless the second proposition, which I\r\nmean presently also to consider, is unfounded? And that is, that the\r\ntendency of the system is to sustain, and that it has upheld, the prices\r\nof all our agricultural and other produce, including cotton.\r\n\r\nAnd is the fact not indisputable that all essential objects of\r\nconsumption affected by the tariff are cheaper and better since the act\r\nof 1824 than they were for several years prior to that law? I appeal for\r\nits truth to common observation, and to all practical men. I appeal to\r\nthe farmer of the country whether he does not purchase on better\r\nterms his iron, salt, brown sugar, cotton goods, and woollens, for his\r\nlaboring people? And I ask the cotton-planter if he has not been better\r\nand more cheaply supplied with his cotton-bagging? In regard to this\r\nlatter article, the gentleman from South Carolina was mistaken in\r\nsupposing that I complained that, under the existing duty, the Kentucky\r\nmanufacturer could not compete with the Scotch. The Kentuckian furnishes\r\na more substantial and a cheaper article, and at a more uniform and\r\nregular price. But it was the frauds, the violations of law, of which I\r\ndid complain; not smuggling, in the common sense of that practice, which\r\nhas something bold, daring, and enterprising in it, but mean, barefaced\r\ncheating, by fraudulent invoices and false denominations.\r\n\r\nI plant myself upon this fact, of cheapness and superiority, as upon\r\nimpregnable ground. Gentlemen may tax their ingenuity, and produce a\r\nthousand speculative solutions of the fact, but the fact itself will\r\nremain undisturbed. Let us look into some particulars. The total\r\nconsumption of bar-iron in the United States is supposed to be about\r\n146,000 tons, of which 112,866 tons are made within the country, and\r\nthe residue imported. The number of men employed in the manufacture is\r\nestimated at 29,254, and the total number of persons subsisted by it at\r\n146,273. The measure of protection extended to this necessary article\r\nwas never fully adequate until the passage of the act of 1828; and what\r\nhas been the consequence? The annual increase of quantity since that\r\nperiod has been in a ratio of near twenty-five per centum, and the\r\nwholesale price of bar-iron in the Northern cities was, in 1828,\r\n$105 per ton; in 1829, $100; in 1830, $90; and in 1831, from $85 to\r\n$75--constantly diminishing. We import very little English iron, and\r\nthat which we do is very inferior, and only adapted to a few purposes.\r\nIn instituting a comparison between that inferior article and our\r\nsuperior iron, subjects entirely different are compared. They are made\r\nby different processes. The English cannot make iron of equal quality to\r\nours at a less price than we do. They have three classes, best-best,\r\nand best, and ordinary. It is the latter which is imported. Of the whole\r\namount imported there is only about 4,000 tons of foreign iron that\r\npays the high duty, the residue paying only a duty of about thirty per\r\ncentum, estimated on the prices of the importation of 1829. Our iron\r\nore is superior to that of Great Britain, yielding often from sixty to\r\neighty per centum, while theirs produces only about twenty-five. This\r\nfact is so well known that I have heard of recent exportations of iron\r\nore to England.\r\n\r\nIt has been alleged that bar-iron, being a raw material, ought to be\r\nadmitted free, or with low duties, for the sake of the manufacturers\r\nthemselves. But I take this to be the true principle: that if our\r\ncountry is producing a raw material of prime necessity, and with\r\nreasonable protection can produce it in sufficient quantity to supply\r\nour wants, that raw material ought to be protected, although it may be\r\nproper to protect the article also out of which it is manufactured.\r\nThe tailor will ask protection for himself, but wishes it denied to the\r\ngrower of wool and the manufacturer of broadcloth. The cotton-planter\r\nenjoys protection for the raw material, but does not desire it to\r\nbe extended to the cotton manufacturer. The ship-builder will ask\r\nprotection for navigation, but does not wish it extended to the\r\nessential articles which enter into the construction of his ship. Each\r\nin his proper vocation solicits protection, but would have it denied to\r\nall other interests which are supposed to come into collision with his.\r\n\r\nNow, the duty of the statesman is to elevate himself above these petty\r\nconflicts; calmly to survey all the various interests, and deliberately\r\nto proportion the measures of protection to each according to its nature\r\nand the general wants of society. It is quite possible that, in the\r\ndegree of protection which has been afforded to the various workers in\r\niron, there may be some error committed, although I have lately read an\r\nargument of much ability, proving that no injustice has really been done\r\nto them. If there be, it ought to be remedied.\r\n\r\nThe next article to which I would call the attention of the Senate, is\r\nthat of cotton fabrics. The success of our manufacture of coarse cottons\r\nis generally admitted. It is demonstrated by the fact that they meet\r\nthe cotton fabrics of other countries in foreign markets, and maintain\r\na successful competition with them. There has been a gradual increase\r\nof the exports of this article, which is sent to Mexico and the South\r\nAmerican republics, to the Mediterranean, and even to Asia. * * *\r\n\r\nI hold in my hand a statement, derived from the most authentic source,\r\nshowing that the identical description of cotton cloth, which sold\r\nin 1817 at twenty-nine cents per yard, was sold in 1819 at twenty-one\r\ncents, in 1821 at nine-teen and a half cents, in 1823 at seventeen\r\ncents, in 1825 at fourteen and a half cents, in 1827 at thirteen cents,\r\nin 1829 at nine cents, in 1830 at nine and a half cents, and in 1831\r\nat from ten and a half to eleven. Such is the wonderful effect of\r\nprotection, competition, and improvement in skill, combined. The year\r\n1829 was one of some suffering to this branch of industry, probably\r\nowing to the principle of competition being pushed too far. Hence\r\nwe observe a small rise of the article of the next two years. The\r\nintroduction of calico-printing into the United States, constitutes an\r\nimportant era in our manufacturing industry. It commenced about the\r\nyear 1825, and has since made such astonishing advances, that the whole\r\nquantity now annually printed is but little short of forty millions of\r\nyards--about two thirds of our whole consumption. * * *\r\n\r\nIn respect to woollens, every gentleman's own observation and experience\r\nwill enable him to judge of the great reduction of price which has taken\r\nplace in most of these articles since the tariff of 1824. It would have\r\nbeen still greater, but for the high duty on raw material, imposed for\r\nthe particular benefit of the farming interest. But, without going into\r\nparticular details, I shall limit myself to inviting the attention\r\nof the Senate to a single article of general and necessary use. The\r\nprotection given to flannels in 1828 was fully adequate. It has enabled\r\nthe American manufacturer to obtain complete possession of the American\r\nmarket; and now, let us look at the effect. I have before me a statement\r\nfrom a highly respectable mercantile house, showing the price of four\r\ndescriptions of flannels during six years. The average price of them, in\r\n1826, was thirty-eight and three quarter cents; in 1827, thirty-eight;\r\nin 1828 (the year of the tariff), forty-six; in 1829, thirty-six; in\r\n1830, (notwithstanding the advance in the price of wool), thirty-two;\r\nand in 1831, thirty-two and one quarter. These facts require no\r\ncomments. I have before me another statement of a practical and\r\nrespectable man, well versed in the flannel manufacture in America and\r\nEngland, demonstrating that the cost of manufacture is precisely the\r\nsame in both countries: and that, although a yard of flannel which would\r\nsell in England at fifteen cents would command here twenty-two, the\r\ndifference of seven cents is the exact difference between the cost\r\nin the two countries of the six ounces of wool contained in a yard of\r\nflannel.\r\n\r\nBrown sugar, during ten years, from 1792 to 1802, with a duty of one\r\nand a half cents per pound, averaged fourteen cents per pound. The\r\nsame article, during ten years, from 1820 to 1830, with a duty of three\r\ncents, has averaged only eight cents per pound. Nails, with a duty of\r\nfive cents per pound, are selling at six cents. Window-glass, eight by\r\nten, prior to the tariff of 1824, sold at twelve or thirteen dollars per\r\nhundred feet; it now sells for three dollars and seventy-five cents. * * *\r\n\r\nThis brings me to consider what I apprehend to have been the most\r\nefficient of all the causes in the reduction of the prices of\r\nmanufactured articles, and that is COMPETITION. By competition the\r\ntotal amount of the supply is increased, and by increase of the supply a\r\ncompetition in the sale ensues, and this enables the consumer to buy at\r\nlower rates. Of all human powers operating on the affairs of mankind,\r\nnone is greater than that of competition. It is action and reaction. It\r\noperates between individuals of the same nation, and between different\r\nnations. It resembles the meeting of the mountain torrent, grooving, by\r\nits precipitous motion, its own channel, and ocean's tide. Unopposed,\r\nit sweeps every thing before it; but, counterpoised, the waters become\r\ncalm, safe, and regular. It is like the segments of a circle or an arch:\r\ntaken separately, each is nothing; but in their combination they produce\r\nefficiency, symmetry, and perfection. By the American system this vast\r\npower has been excited in America, and brought into being to act in\r\ncooperation or collision with European industry. Europe acts within\r\nitself, and with America; and America acts within itself, and with\r\nEurope. The consequence is the reduction of prices in both hemispheres.\r\nNor is it fair to argue from the reduction of prices in Europe to her\r\nown presumed skill and labor exclusively. We affect her prices, and she\r\naffects ours. This must always be the case, at least in reference to any\r\narticles as to which there is not a total non-intercourse; and if our\r\nindustry, by diminishing the demand for her supplies, should produce a\r\ndiminution in the price of those supplies, it would be very unfair to\r\nascribe that reduction to her ingenuity, instead of placing it to the\r\ncredit of our own skill and excited industry.\r\n\r\nPractical men understand very well this state of the case, whether\r\nthey do or do not comprehend the causes which produce it. I have in my\r\npossession a letter from a respectable merchant, well known to me, in\r\nwhich he says, after complaining of the operation of the tariff of 1828,\r\non the articles to which it applies, some of which he had imported, and\r\nthat his purchases having been made in England before the passage of\r\nthat tariff was known, it produced such an effect upon the English\r\nmarket that the articles could not be resold without loss, and he adds:\r\n\"For it really appears that, when additional duties are laid upon\r\nan article, it then becomes lower instead of higher!\" This would not\r\nprobably happen where the supply of the foreign article did not exceed\r\nthe home demand, unless upon the supposition of the increased duty\r\nhaving excited or stimulated the measure of the home production.\r\n\r\nThe great law of price is determined by supply and demand. What affects\r\neither affects the price. If the supply is increased, the demand\r\nremaining the same, the price declines; if the demand is increased, the\r\nsupply remaining the same, the price advances; if both supply and demand\r\nare undiminished, the price is stationary, and the price is influenced\r\nexactly in proportion to the degree of disturbance to the demand or\r\nsupply. It is, therefore, a great error to suppose that an existing or\r\nnew duty necessarily becomes a component element to its exact amount of\r\nprice. If the proportions of demand and supply are varied by the duty,\r\neither in augmenting the supply or diminishing the demand, or vice\r\nversa, the price is affected to the extent of that variation. But\r\nthe duty never becomes an integral part of the price, except in the\r\ninstances where the demand and the supply remain after the duty is\r\nimposed precisely what they were before, or the demand is increased, and\r\nthe supply remains stationary.\r\n\r\nCompetition, therefore, wherever existing, whether at home or abroad,\r\nis the parent cause of cheapness. If a high duty excites production at\r\nhome, and the quantity of the domestic article exceeds the amount which\r\nhad been previously imported, the price will fall. * * *\r\n\r\nBut it is argued that if, by the skill, experience, and perfection which\r\nwe have acquired in certain branches of manufacture, they can be made as\r\ncheap as similar articles abroad, and enter fairly into competition with\r\nthem, why not repeal the duties as to those articles? And why should we?\r\nAssuming the truth of the supposition, the foreign article would not be\r\nintroduced in the regular course of trade, but would remain excluded\r\nby the possession of the home market, which the domestic article had\r\nobtained. The repeal, therefore, would have no legitimate effect. But\r\nmight not the foreign article be imported in vast quantities, to glut\r\nour markets, break down our establishments, and ultimately to enable the\r\nforeigner to monopolize the supply of our consumption? America is the\r\ngreatest foreign market for European manufactures. It is that to which\r\nEuropean attention is constantly directed. If a great house becomes\r\nbankrupt there, its storehouses are emptied, and the goods are shipped\r\nto America, where, in consequence of our auctions, and our custom-house\r\ncredits, the greatest facilities are afforded in the sale of them.\r\nCombinations among manufacturers might take place, or even the\r\noperations of foreign governments might be directed to the destruction\r\nof our establishments. A repeal, therefore, of one protecting duty,\r\nfrom some one or all of these causes, would be followed by flooding the\r\ncountry with the foreign fabric, surcharging the market, reducing the\r\nprice, and a complete prostration of our manufactories; after which\r\nthe foreigner would leisurely look about to indemnify himself in the\r\nincreased prices which he would be enabled to command by his monopoly\r\nof the supply of our consumption. What American citizen, after the\r\ngovernment had displayed this vacillating policy, would be again tempted\r\nto place the smallest confidence in the public faith, and adventure once\r\nmore into this branch of industry?\r\n\r\nGentlemen have allowed to the manufacturing portions of the community\r\nno peace; they have been constantly threatened with the overthrow of\r\nthe American system. From the year 1820, if not from 1816, down to\r\nthis time, they have been held in a condition of constant alarm and\r\ninsecurity. Nothing is more prejudicial to the great interests of a\r\nnation than an unsettled and varying policy. Although every appeal to\r\nthe National Legislature has been responded to in conformity with the\r\nwishes and sentiments of the great majority of the people, measures of\r\nprotection have only been carried by such small majorities as to excite\r\nhopes on the one hand, and fears on the other. Let the country breathe,\r\nlet its vast resources be developed, let its energies be fully put\r\nforth, let it have tranquillity, and, my word for it, the degree of\r\nperfection in the arts which it will exhibit will be greater than that\r\nwhich has been presented, astonishing as our progress has been. Although\r\nsome branches of our manufactures might, and in foreign markets now do,\r\nfearlessly contend with similar foreign fabrics, there are many others\r\nyet in their infancy, struggling with the difficulties which encompass\r\nthem. We should look at the whole system, and recollect that time, when\r\nwe contemplate the great movements of a nation, is very different from\r\nthe short period which is allotted for the duration of individual life.\r\nThe honorable gentleman from South Carolina well and eloquently said,\r\nin 1824: \"No great interest of any country ever grew up in a day; no new\r\nbranch of industry can become firmly and profitably established but in a\r\nlong course of years; every thing, indeed, great or good, is matured by\r\nslow degrees; that which attains a speedy maturity is of small value,\r\nand is destined to brief existence. It is the order of Providence,\r\nthat powers gradually developed, shall alone attain permanency and\r\nperfection. Thus must it be with our national institutions, and national\r\ncharacter itself.\"\r\n\r\nI feel most sensibly, Mr. President, how much I have trespassed upon the\r\nSenate. My apology is a deep and deliberate conviction, that the great\r\ncause under debate involves the prosperity and the destiny of the Union.\r\nBut the best requital I can make, for the friendly indulgence which has\r\nbeen extended to me by the Senate, and for which I shall ever retain\r\nsentiments of lasting gratitude, is to proceed with as little delay as\r\npracticable, to the conclusion of a discourse which has not been more\r\ntedious to the Senate than exhausting to me. I have now to consider the\r\nremaining of the two propositions which I have already announced. That\r\nis\r\n\r\nSecond, that under the operation of the American system, the products of\r\nour agriculture command a higher price than they would do without it,\r\nby the creation of a home market, and by the augmentation of wealth\r\nproduced by manufacturing industry, which enlarges our powers of\r\nconsumption both of domestic and foreign articles. The importance of\r\nthe home market is among the established maxims which are universally\r\nrecognized by all writers and all men. However some may differ as to the\r\nrelative advantages of the foreign and the home market, none deny to the\r\nlatter great value and high consideration. It is nearer to us;\r\nbeyond the control of foreign legislation; and undisturbed by those\r\nvicissitudes to which all inter-national intercourse is more or less\r\nexposed. The most stupid are sensible of the benefit of a residence\r\nin the vicinity of a large manufactory, or of a market-town, of a good\r\nroad, or of a navigable stream, which connects their farms with some\r\ngreat capital. If the pursuits of all men were perfectly the same,\r\nalthough they would be in possession of the greatest abundance of the\r\nparticular products of their industry, they might, at the same time, be\r\nin extreme want of other necessary articles of human subsistence. The\r\nuniformity of the general occupation would preclude all exchange, all\r\ncommerce. It is only in the diversity of the vocations of the members\r\nof a community that the means can be found for those salutary exchanges\r\nwhich conduce to the general prosperity. And the greater that diversity,\r\nthe more extensive and the more animating is the circle of exchange.\r\nEven if foreign markets were freely and widely open to the reception of\r\nour agricultural produce, from its bulky nature, and the distance of the\r\ninterior, and the dangers of the ocean, large portions of it could\r\nnever profitably reach the foreign market. But let us quit this field\r\nof theory, clear as it is, and look at the practical operation of the\r\nsystem of protection, beginning with the most valuable staple of our\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nIn considering this staple, the first circumstance that excites our\r\nsurprise is the rapidity with which the amount of it has annually\r\nincreased. Does not this fact, however, demonstrate that the cultivation\r\nof it could not have been so very unprofitable? If the business were\r\nruinous, would more and more have annually engaged in it? The quantity\r\nin 1816 was eighty-one millions of pounds; in 1826, two hundred and\r\nfour millions; and in 1830, near three hundred millions! The ground of\r\ngreatest surprise is that it has been able to sustain even its present\r\nprice with such an enormous augmentation of quantity. It could not have\r\nbeen done but for the combined operation of three causes, by which the\r\nconsumption of cotton fabrics has been greatly extended in consequence\r\nof their reduced prices: first, competition; second, the improvement of\r\nlabor-saving machinery; and thirdly, the low price of the raw material.\r\nThe crop of 1819, amounting to eighty-eight millions of pounds, produced\r\ntwenty-one millions of dollars; the crop of 1823, when the amount was\r\nswelled to one hundred and seventy-four millions (almost double of that\r\nof 1819), produced a less sum by more than half a million of dollars;\r\nand the crop of 1824, amounting to thirty millions of pounds less than\r\nthat of the preceding year, produced a million and a half of dollars\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nIf there be any foundation for the established law of price, supply,\r\nand demand, ought not the fact of this great increase of the supply to\r\naccount satisfactorily for the alleged low price of cotton? * * *\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that the home demand for cotton, which has been created\r\nby the American system, should cease, and that the two hundred thousand\r\nbales which the home market now absorbs were now thrown into the glutted\r\nmarkets of foreign countries; would not the effect inevitably be to\r\nproduce a further and great reduction in the price of the article?\r\nIf there be any truth in the facts and principles which I have before\r\nstated and endeavored to illustrate, it cannot be doubted that the\r\nexistence of American manufactures has tended to increase the demand\r\nand extend the consumption of the raw material; and that, but for this\r\nincreased demand, the price of the article would have fallen possibly\r\none half lower than it now is. The error of the opposite argument is\r\nin assuming one thing, which being denied, the whole fails--that is, it\r\nassumes that the whole labor of the United States would be profitably\r\nemployed without manufactures. Now, the truth is that the system excites\r\nand creates labor, and this labor creates wealth, and this new wealth\r\ncommunicates additional ability to consume, which acts on all the\r\nobjects contributing to human comfort and enjoyment. The amount of\r\ncotton imported into the two ports of Boston and Providence alone during\r\nthe last year (and it was imported exclusively for the home manufacture)\r\nwas 109,517 bales.\r\n\r\nOn passing from that article to others of our agricultural productions,\r\nwe shall find not less gratifying facts. The total quantity of flour\r\nimported into Boston, during the same year, was 284,504 barrels, and\r\n3,955 half barrels; of which, there were from Virginia, Georgetown, and\r\nAlexandria, 114,222 barrels; of Indian corn, 681,131 bushels; of oats,\r\n239,809 bushels; of rye, about 50,000 bushels; and of shorts, 63,489\r\nbushels; into the port of Providence, 71,369 barrels of flour; 216,662\r\nbushels of Indian corn, and 7,772 bushels of rye. And there were\r\ndischarged at the port of Philadelphia, 420,353 bushels of Indian corn,\r\n201,878 bushels of wheat, and 110,557 bushels of rye and barley.\r\nThere were slaughtered in Boston during the same year, 1831, (the only\r\nNorthern city from which I have obtained returns,) 33,922 beef cattle;\r\n15,400 calves; 84,453 sheep, and 26,871 swine. It is confidently\r\nbelieved that there is not a less quantity of Southern flour consumed\r\nat the North than eight hundred thousand barrels, a greater amount,\r\nprobably, than is shipped to all the foreign markets of the world\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the condition of the farming country of the United\r\nStates--of all that portion which lies north, east, and west of James\r\nRiver, including a large part of North Carolina--if a home market did\r\nnot exist for this immense amount of agricultural produce. Without that\r\nmarket, where could it be sold? In foreign markets? If their restrictive\r\nlaws did not exist, their capacity would not enable them to purchase\r\nand consume this vast addition to their present supplies, which must\r\nbe thrown in, or thrown away, but for the home market. But their laws\r\nexclude us from their markets. I shall content myself by calling the\r\nattention of the Senate to Great Britain only. The duties in the ports\r\nof the united kingdom on bread-stuffs are prohibitory, except in times\r\nof dearth. On rice, the duty is fifteen shillings sterling per hundred\r\nweight, being more than one hundred per centum. On manufactured tobacco\r\nit is nine shillings sterling per pound, or about two thousand per\r\ncentum. On leaf tobacco three shillings per pound, or one thousand two\r\nhundred per centum. On lumber, and some other articles, they are from\r\nfour hundred to fifteen hundred per centum more than on similar articles\r\nimported from British colonies. In the British West Indies the duty on\r\nbeef, pork, hams, and bacon, is twelve shillings sterling per hundred,\r\nmore than one hundred per centum on the first cost of beef and pork in\r\nthe Western States. And yet Great Britain is the power in whose behalf\r\nwe are called upon to legislate, so that we may enable her to purchase\r\nour cotton. Great Britain, that thinks only of herself in her own\r\nlegislation! When have we experienced justice, much less favor, at\r\nher hands? When did she shape her legislation with reference to the\r\ninterests of any foreign power? She is a great, opulent, and powerful\r\nnation; but haughty, arrogant, and supercilious; not more separated\r\nfrom the rest of the world by the sea that girts her island, than she\r\nis separated in feeling, sympathy, or friendly consideration of their\r\nwelfare. Gentlemen, in supposing it impracticable that we should\r\nsuccessfully compete with her in manufactures, do injustice to the\r\nskill and enterprise of their own country. Gallant as Great Britain\r\nundoubtedly is, we have gloriously contended with her, man to man, gun\r\nto gun, ship to ship, fleet to fleet, and army to army. And I have no\r\ndoubt we are destined to achieve equal success in the more useful, if\r\nnot nobler, contest for superiority in the arts of civil life.\r\n\r\nI could extend and dwell on the long list of articles--the hemp, iron,\r\nlead, coal, and other items--for which a demand is created in the home\r\nmarket by the operation of the American system; but I should exhaust\r\nthe patience of the Senate. Where, where should we find a market for all\r\nthese articles, if it did not exist at home? What would be the condition\r\nof the largest portion of our people, and of the territory, if this\r\nhome market were annihilated? How could they be supplied with objects of\r\nprime necessity? What would not be the certain and inevitable decline in\r\nthe price of all these articles, but for the home market? And allow me,\r\nMr. President, to say, that of all the agricultural parts of the United\r\nStates which are benefited by the operation of this system, none are\r\nequally so with those which border the Chesapeake Bay, the lower parts\r\nof North Carolina, Virginia, and the two shores of Mary-land. Their\r\nfacilities of transportation, and proximity to the North, give them\r\ndecided advantages.\r\n\r\nBut if all this reasoning were totally fallacious; if the price of\r\nmanufactured articles were really higher, under the American system,\r\nthan without it, I should still argue that high or low prices were\r\nthemselves relative--relative to the ability to pay them. It is in vain\r\nto tempt, to tantalize us with the lower prices of European fabrics than\r\nour own, if we have nothing wherewith to purchase them. If, by the home\r\nexchanges, we can be supplied with necessary, even if they are dearer\r\nand worse, articles of American production than the foreign, it is\r\nbetter than not to be supplied at all. And how would the large portion\r\nof our country, which I have described, be supplied, but for the\r\nhome exchanges? A poor people, destitute of wealth or of exchangeable\r\ncommodities, have nothing to purchase foreign fabrics with. To them\r\nthey are equally beyond their reach, whether their cost be a dollar or a\r\nguinea. It is in this view of the matter that Great Britain, by her vast\r\nwealth, her excited and protected industry, is enabled to bear a burden\r\nof taxation, which, when compared to that of other nations, appears\r\nenormous; but which, when her immense riches are compared to theirs, is\r\nlight and trivial. The gentleman from South Carolina has drawn a lively\r\nand flattering picture of our coasts, bays, rivers, and harbors; and he\r\nargues that these proclaimed the design of Providence that we should be\r\na commercial people. I agree with him. We differ only as to the means.\r\nHe would cherish the foreign, and neglect the internal, trade. I would\r\nfoster both. What is navigation without ships, or ships without cargoes?\r\nBy penetrating the bosoms of our mountains, and extracting from them\r\ntheir precious treasures; by cultivating the earth, and securing a home\r\nmarket for its rich and abundant products; by employing the water power\r\nwith which we are blessed; by stimulating and protecting our native\r\nindustry, in all its forms; we shall but nourish and promote the\r\nprosperity of commerce, foreign and domestic.\r\n\r\nI have hitherto considered the question in reference only to a state of\r\npeace; but who can tell when the storm of war shall again break forth?\r\nHave we forgotten so soon the privations to which not merely our brave\r\nsoldiers and our gallant tars were subjected, but the whole community,\r\nduring the last war, for the want of absolute necessaries? To what an\r\nenormous price they rose! And how inadequate the supply was, at any\r\nprice! The states-man who justly elevates his views will look behind\r\nas well as forward, and at the existing state of things; and he will\r\ngraduate the policy which he recommends to all the probable exigencies\r\nwhich may arise in the republic. Taking this comprehensive range, it\r\nwould be easy to show that the higher prices of peace, if prices were\r\nhigher in peace, were more than compensated by the lower prices of war,\r\nduring which supplies of all essential articles are indispensable to its\r\nvigorous, effectual, and glorious prosecution. I conclude this part\r\nof the argument with the hope that my humble exertions have not been\r\naltogether unsuccessful in showing:\r\n\r\nFirst, that the policy which we have been considering ought to continue\r\nto be regarded as the genuine American system.\r\n\r\nSecondly, that the free-trade system, which is proposed as its\r\nsubstitute, ought really to be considered as the British colonial\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThirdly, that the American system is beneficial to all parts of the\r\nUnion, and absolutely necessary to much the larger portion.\r\n\r\nFourthly, that the price of the great staple of cotton, and of all our\r\nchief productions of agriculture, has been sustained and upheld, and a\r\ndecline averted, by the protective system.\r\n\r\nFifthly, that if the foreign demand for cotton has been at all\r\ndiminished, the diminution has been more than compensated in the\r\nadditional demand created at home.\r\n\r\nSixthly, that the constant tendency of the system, by creating\r\ncompetition among ourselves, and between American and European industry,\r\nreciprocally acting upon each other, is to reduce prices of manufactured\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nSeventhly, that, in point of fact, objects within the scope of the\r\npolicy of protection have greatly fallen in price.\r\n\r\nEighthly, that if, in a season of peace, these benefits are experienced,\r\nin a season of war, when the foreign supply might be cut off, they would\r\nbe much more extensively felt.\r\n\r\nNinthly, and finally, that the substitution of the British colonial\r\nsystem for the American system, without benefiting any section of the\r\nUnion, by subjecting us to a foreign legislation, regulated by foreign\r\ninterests, would lead to the prostration of our manufactories, general\r\nimpoverishment, and ultimate ruin. * * * The danger of our Union does\r\nnot lie on the side of persistence in the American system, but on that\r\nof its abandonment. If, as I have supposed and believe, the inhabitants\r\nof all north and east of James River, and all west of the mountains,\r\nincluding Louisiana, are deeply interested in the preservation of that\r\nsystem, would they be reconciled to its overthrow? Can it be expected\r\nthat two thirds, if not three fourths, of the people of the United\r\nStates would consent to the destruction of a policy, believed to be\r\nindispensably necessary to their prosperity? When, too, the sacrifice\r\nis made at the instance of a single interest, which they verily believe\r\nwill not be promoted by it? In estimating the degree of peril which may\r\nbe incident to two opposite courses of human policy, the statesman would\r\nbe short-sighted who should content himself with viewing only the evils,\r\nreal or imaginary, which belong to that course which is in practical\r\noperation. He should lift himself up to the contemplation of those\r\ngreater and more certain dangers which might inevitably attend the\r\nadoption of the alternative course. What would be the condition of\r\nthis Union, if Pennsylvania and New York, those mammoth members of our\r\nConfederacy, were firmly persuaded that their industry was paralyzed,\r\nand their prosperity blighted, by the enforcement of the British\r\ncolonial system, under the delusive name of free trade? They are now\r\ntranquil and happy and contented, conscious of their welfare, and\r\nfeeling a salutary and rapid circulation of the products of home\r\nmanufactures and home industry, throughout all their great arteries.\r\nBut let that be checked, let them feel that a foreign system is to\r\npredominate, and the sources of their subsistence and comfort dried up;\r\nlet New England and the West, and the Middle States, all feel that they\r\ntoo are the victims of a mistaken policy, and let these vast portions\r\nof our country despair of any favorable change, and then indeed might we\r\ntremble for the continuance and safety of this Union!\r\n\r\nAnd need I remind you, sir, that this dereliction of the duty of\r\nprotecting our domestic industry, and abandonment of it to the fate\r\nof foreign legislation, would be directly at war with leading\r\nconsiderations which prompted the adoption of the present Constitution?\r\nThe States respectively surrendered to the general government the whole\r\npower of laying imposts on foreign goods. They stripped themselves of\r\nall power to protect their own manufactures by the most efficacious\r\nmeans of encouragement--the imposition of duties on rival foreign\r\nfabrics. Did they create that great trust, did they voluntarily subject\r\nthemselves to this self-restriction, that the power should remain in the\r\nFederal government inactive, unexecuted, and lifeless? Mr. Madison, at\r\nthe commencement of the government, told you otherwise. In discussing\r\nat that early period this very subject, he declared that a failure to\r\nexercise this power would be a \"fraud\" upon the Northern States, to\r\nwhich may now be added the Middle and Western States.\r\n\r\n[Governor Miller asked to what expression of Mr. Madison's opinion Mr.\r\nClay referred; and Mr. Clay replied, his opinion, expressed in the\r\nHouse of Representatives in 1789, as reported in Lloyd's Congressional\r\nDebates.]\r\n\r\nGentlemen are greatly deceived as to the hold which this system has in\r\nthe affections of the people of the United States. They represent that\r\nit is the policy of New England, and that she is most benefited by it.\r\nIf there be any part of this Union which has been most steady, most\r\nunanimous, and most determined in its support, it is Pennsylvania. Why\r\nis not that powerful State attacked? Why pass her over, and aim the blow\r\nat New England? New England came reluctantly into the policy. In 1824, a\r\nmajority of her delegation was opposed to it. From the largest State\r\nof New England there was but a solitary vote in favor of the bill. That\r\ninteresting people can readily accommodate their industry to any policy,\r\nprovided it be settled. They supposed this was fixed, and they submitted\r\nto the decrees of government. And the progress of public opinion has\r\nkept pace with the developments of the benefits of the system. Now, all\r\nNew England, at least in this House (with the exception of one small\r\nstill voice), is in favor of the system. In 1824, all Maryland was\r\nagainst it; now the majority is for it. Then, Louisiana, with one\r\nexception, was opposed to it; now, without any exception, she is in\r\nfavor of it. The march of public sentiment is to the South. Virginia\r\nwill be the next convert; and in less than seven years, if there be no\r\nobstacles from political causes, or prejudices industriously instilled,\r\nthe majority of Eastern Virginia will be, as the majority of Western\r\nVirginia now is, in favor of the American system. North Carolina will\r\nfollow later, but not less certainly. Eastern Tennessee is now in favor\r\nof the system. And, finally, its doctrines will pervade the whole Union,\r\nand the wonder will be, that they ever should have been opposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANK H. HURD,\r\n\r\nOF OHIO. (BORN 1841, DIED 1896.)\r\n\r\nA TARIFF FOR REVENUE ONLY;\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, FEBRUARY 18, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. CHAIRMAN:\r\n\r\nAt the very threshold it is proper to define the terms I shall use and\r\nstate the exact propositions I purpose to maintain. A tariff is a tax\r\nupon imported goods. Like other taxes which are levied, it should\r\nbe imposed only to raise revenue for the government. It is true that\r\nincidental protection to some industries will occur when the duty is\r\nplaced upon articles which may enter into competition with those\r\nof domestic manufacture. I do not propose to discuss now how this\r\nincidental protection shall be distributed. This will be a subsequent\r\nconsideration when the preliminary question has been settled as to what\r\nshall be the nature of the tariff itself. The present tariff imposes\r\nduties upon nearly four thousand articles, and was levied and is\r\ndefended upon the ground that American industries should be protected.\r\nThus protection has been made the object; revenue the incident. Indeed,\r\nin many cases the duty is so high that no revenue whatever is raised\r\nfor the government, and in nearly all so high that much less revenue is\r\ncollected than might be realized. So true is this that, if the present\r\ntariff were changed so as to make it thereby a revenue tariff, one fifth\r\nat least could be added to the receipts of the Treasury from imports.\r\nWhenever I use the phrase free trade or free trader, I mean either a\r\ntariff for revenue only or one who advocates it.\r\n\r\nSo far as a tariff for revenue is concerned, I do not oppose it, even\r\nthough it may contain some objectionable incidental protection. The\r\nnecessities of the government require large revenues, and it is not\r\nproposed to interfere with a tariff so long as it is levied to produce\r\nthem; but, to a tariff levied for protection in itself and for its own\r\nsake, I do object. I therefore oppose the present tariff, and the whole\r\ndoctrine by which it is attempted to be justified. I make war against\r\nall its protective features, and insist that the laws which contain them\r\nshall be amended, so that out of the importations upon which the duty is\r\nlevied the greatest possible revenue for the government may be obtained.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the theory of protection? It is based upon the idea that\r\nforeign produce imported into this country will enter into competition\r\nwith domestic products and undersell them in the home market, thus\r\ncrippling if not destroying domestic production. To prevent this, the\r\nprice of the foreign goods in the home market is increased so as to keep\r\nthem out of the country altogether, or to place the foreigner, in the\r\ncost of production, upon the same footing as the American producer. This\r\nis proposed to be done by levying a duty upon the foreign importation.\r\nIf it be so high that the importer cannot pay it and sell the goods at\r\na profit, the facilities of production between this and other countries\r\nare said to be equalized, and the American producer is said to be\r\nprotected. It will be seen, therefore, that protection means the\r\nincrease of price. Without it the fabric has no foundation on which to\r\nrest. If the foreign goods are still imported, the importer adds the\r\nduty paid to the selling price. If he cannot import with profit, the\r\nAmerican producer raises his price to a point always below that at which\r\nthe foreign goods could be profitably brought into the country, and\r\ncontrols the market. In either event, there is an increase of price of\r\nthe products sought to be protected. The bald proposition therefore is\r\nthat American industries can and ought to be protected by increasing the\r\nprices of the products of such industries.\r\n\r\nThere are three popular opinions, industriously cultivated and\r\nstrengthened by adroit advocates, upon which the whole system rests,\r\nand to which appeals are ever confidently made. These opinions are\r\nerroneous, and lead to false conclusions, and should be first considered\r\nin every discussion of this question.\r\n\r\nThe first is, that the balance of trade is in our favor when our\r\nexportations exceed our importations. Upon this theory it is argued that\r\nit cannot be unwise to put restrictions upon importations, for they say\r\nthat at one and the same time you give protection to our industries and\r\nkeep the balance of trade in our favor. But the slightest investigation\r\nwill show that this proposition cannot be maintained. A single\r\nillustration, often repeated, but never old in this discussion, will\r\ndemonstrate it. Let a ship set sail from Portland, Maine, with a cargo\r\nof staves registered at the port of departure as worth $5,000. They\r\nare carried to the West India Islands, where staves are in demand, and\r\nexchanged for sugar or molasses. The ship returns, and after duty paid\r\nthe owner sells his sugar and molasses at a profit of $5,000. Here more\r\nhas been imported than exported. Upon this transaction the protectionist\r\nwould say that the balance of trade was against us $5,000; the free\r\ntrader says that the sum represents the profit to the shipper upon his\r\ntraffic, and the true balance in our favor.\r\n\r\nSuppose that after it has set sail the vessel with its cargo had been\r\nlost. In such case five thousand dollars' worth of goods would have been\r\nexported, with no importation against it. The exportation has exceeded\r\nthe importation that sum. Is not the balance of trade, according to\r\nthe protection theory, to that amount in our favor? Then let the\r\nprotectionist turn pirate and scuttle and sink all the vessels laden\r\nwith our exports, and soon the balance of trade in our favor will be\r\nlarge enough to satisfy even most advocates of the American protective\r\nsystem. The true theory is that in commerce the overplus of the\r\nimportation above the exportation represents the profit accruing to the\r\ncountry. This overplus, deducting the expenses, is real wealth added to\r\nthe land. Push the two theories to their last position and the true one\r\nwill be clearly seen. Export every thing, import nothing, though the\r\nbalance of trade may be said to be overwhelmingly in our favor, there\r\nis poverty, scarcity, death. Import every thing, export nothing, we\r\nthen will have in addition to our own all the wealth of the world in our\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it is said that a nation should be independent of foreign\r\nnations, lest in time of war it might find itself helpless or\r\ndefenceless. Free trade, it is charged, makes a people dependent upon\r\nforeigners. But traffic is exchange. Foreign products do not come into a\r\ncountry unless domestic products go out. This dependence, therefore, is\r\nmutual. By trade with foreign nations they are as dependent upon us as\r\nwe upon them, and in the event of a disturbance of peace the nation with\r\nwhich we would be at war would lose just as much as we would lose, and\r\nboth as to the war would in that regard stand upon terms of equality. It\r\nmust not be forgotten that the obstruction of trade between nations\r\nis one of the greatest occasions of war. It frequently gives rise to\r\nmisunderstandings which result in serious conflicts. By removing these\r\nobstacles and making trade as free as possible, nations are brought\r\ncloser together, the interests of their people become intermingled,\r\nbusiness associations are formed between them, which go far to keep down\r\nnational dispute, and prevent the wars in which the dependent nation is\r\nsaid to be so helpless. Japan and China have for centuries practised the\r\nprotective theory of independence of foreigners, and yet, in a war with\r\nother nations, they would be the most helpless people in the world.\r\nThat nation is the most independent which knows most of, and trades most\r\nwith, the world, and by such knowledge and trade is able to avail itself\r\nof the products of the skill, intellect, and genius of all the nations\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nA third erroneous impression sought to be made upon the public mind is\r\nthat whatever increases the amount of labor in a country is a benefit\r\nto it. Protection, it is argued, will increase the amount of labor,\r\nand therefore will increase a country's prosperity. The error in this\r\nproposition lies in mistaking the true nature of labor. It regards it\r\nas the end, not as the means to an end. Men do not labor merely for the\r\nsake of labor, but that out of its products they may derive support\r\nand comfort for themselves and those dependent upon them. The result,\r\ntherefore, does not depend upon the amount of labor done, but upon the\r\nvalue of the product. That country, therefore, is the most prosperous\r\nwhich enables the laborer to obtain the greatest possible value for the\r\nproduct of his toil, not that which imposes the greatest labor upon him.\r\nIf this were not the case men were better off before the appliances of\r\nsteam as motive power were discovered, or railroads were built, or the\r\ntelegraph was invented. The man who invents a labor-saving machine is a\r\npublic enemy; and he would be a public benefactor who would restore\r\nthe good old times when the farmer never had a leisure day, and the\r\nsun never set on the toil of the mechanic. No, Mr. Chairman, it is the\r\ndesire of every laborer to get the maximum of result from the minimum\r\nof effort. That system, therefore, can be of no advantage to him which,\r\nwhile it gives him employment, robs him of its fruits. This, it will be\r\nseen, protection does, while free trade, giving him unrestricted control\r\nof the product of his labor, enables him to get the fullest value for it\r\nin markets of his own selection.\r\n\r\nThe protectionist, relying upon the propositions I have thus hurriedly\r\ndiscussed, urges many specious reasons for his system, to a few of which\r\nonly do I intend to call attention to-day.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is urged that protection will develop the\r\nresources of a country, which without it would remain undeveloped.\r\nOf course this, to be of advantage to a country, must be a general\r\naggregate increase of development, for if it be an increase of some\r\nresources as a result of diminution in others, the people as a whole can\r\nbe no better off after protection than before. But the general resources\r\ncannot be increased by a tariff. There can only be such an increase by\r\nan addition to the disposable capital of the country to be applied to\r\nthe development of resources. But legislation cannot make this. If it\r\ncould it would only be necessary to enact laws indefinitely to increase\r\ncapital indefinitely. But, if any legislation could accomplish this,\r\nit would not be protective legislation. As already shown, the theory\r\nof protection is to make prices higher, in order to make business\r\nprofitable. This necessarily increases the expense of production, which\r\nkeeps foreign capital away, because it can be employed in the protected\r\nindustries more profit-ably elsewhere. The domestic capital, therefore,\r\nmust be relied upon for the proposed development. As legislation cannot\r\nincrease that capital, if it be tempted by the higher prices to the\r\nbusiness protected, it must be taken from some other business or\r\ninvestment. If there are more workers in factories there will be\r\nfewer artisans. If there are more workers in shops there will be fewer\r\nfarmers. If there are more in the towns there will be fewer in the\r\ncountry. The only effect of protection, therefore, in this point\r\nof view, can be to take capital from some employment to put it into\r\nanother, that the aggregate disposable capital cannot be increased, nor\r\nthe aggregate development of the resources of a country be greater with\r\na tariff than without.\r\n\r\nBut, secondly, it is said that protection increases the number of\r\nindustries, thereby diversifying labor and making a variety in the\r\noccupations of a people who otherwise might be confined to a single\r\nbranch of employment. This argument proceeds upon the assumption that\r\nthere would be no diversification of labor without protection. In other\r\nwords, it is assumed that but for protection our people would devote\r\nthemselves to agriculture. This, however, is not true. Even if a\r\ncommunity were purely agricultural, the necessities of the situation\r\nwould make diversification of industry. There must be blacksmiths,\r\nand shoemakers, and millers, and merchants, and carpenters, and other\r\nartisans. To each one of these employments, as population increases,\r\nmore and more will devote themselves, and with each year new demands\r\nwill spring up, which will create new industries to supply them. I was\r\nborn in the midst of a splendid farming country. The business of nine\r\ntenths of the people of my native county was farming. My intelligent\r\nboyhood was spent there from 1850 to 1860, when there was no tariff for\r\nprotection. There were thriving towns for the general trading. There\r\nwere woollen mills and operatives. There were flouring mills and\r\nmillers. There were iron founders and their employes. There were\r\nartisans of every description. There were grocers and merchants, with\r\nevery variety of goods and wares for sale; there were banks and\r\nbankers; there was all the diversification of industry that a thriving,\r\nindustrious, and intelligent community required; not established by\r\nprotection nor by government aid, but growing naturally out of the\r\nwants and necessities of the people. Such a diversification is always\r\nhealthful, because it is natural, and will continue so long as the\r\npeople are industrious and thrifty. The diversification which protection\r\nmakes is forced and artificial. Suppose protection had come to my native\r\ncounty to further diversify industries. It would have begun by giving\r\nhigher prices to some industry already established, or profits greater\r\nthan the average rate to some new industry which it would have started.\r\nThis would have disturbed the natural order. It would necessarily have\r\nembarrassed some interests to help the protected ones. The loss in the\r\nmost favorable view would have been equal to the gain, and besides trade\r\nwould inevitably have been annoyed by the obstruction of its natural\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\nThe worst feature of this kind of diversified industry is that the\r\nprotected ones never willingly give up the government aid. They scare at\r\ncompetition as a child at a ghost. As soon as the markets seem against\r\nthem, they rush to Congress for further help. They are never content\r\nwith the protection they have; they are always eager for more. In this\r\ndependence upon the government bounty the persons protected learn to\r\ndistrust themselves; and protection therefore inevitably destroys that\r\nmanly, sturdy spirit of individuality and independence which should\r\ncharacterize the successful American business man.\r\n\r\nThirdly, it is said that protection gives increased employment to labor\r\nand enhances the wages of workingmen. For a long time no position was\r\nmore strenuously insisted upon by the advocates of the protective system\r\nthan that the wages of labor would be increased under it. At this point\r\nin the discussion I shall only undertake to show that it is impossible\r\nthat protection should produce this result. What determines the amount\r\nof wages paid? Some maintain that it is the amount of the wage fund\r\nexisting at the time that the labor is done. Under this theory it is\r\nclaimed that, at any given time, there is a certain amount of capital to\r\nbe applied to the payment of wages, as certain and fixed as though its\r\namount had been determined in advance. Others maintain that the amount\r\nof wages is fixed by what the laborer makes, or, in other words, by the\r\nproduct of his work, and that, therefore, his wage is determined by the\r\nefficiency of his labor alone. Both these views are partly true. The\r\nwages of the laborer are undoubtedly determined by the efficiency of his\r\nwork, but the aggregate amount paid for labor cannot exceed the\r\namount properly chargeable to the wage fund without in a little time\r\ndiminishing the profits of production and ultimately the quantity of\r\nlabor employed.'\r\n\r\nBut, whichever theory be true, it is clear that protection can add\r\nnothing to the amount of wages. It cannot increase the amount of capital\r\napplicable to the payment of wages, unless it can be shown that the\r\naggregate capital of a country can be increased by legislation; nor\r\ncan it add to the efficiency of labor, for that depends upon individual\r\neffort exclusively. A man who makes little in a day now may in a year\r\nmake much more in the same time; his labor has become more efficient.\r\nWhether this shalt be done depends on the taste, temperament,\r\napplication, aptitude, and skill of the individual. No one will pretend\r\nthat protection can increase the aggregate of these qualities in\r\nthe labor of the country. The result is that it is impossible for\r\nprotection, either by adding to the wage fund or by increasing the\r\nefficiency of labor, to enhance the wages of laboring men, a theory\r\nwhich I shall shortly show is incontrovertibly established by the facts.\r\n\r\nI will now, Mr. Chairman, briefly present a few of the principal\r\nobjections to a tariff for protection. As has been shown, the basis of\r\nprotection is an increase in the price of the protected products. Who\r\npays this increased price? I shall not stop now to consider the argument\r\noften urged that it is paid by the foreign producer, because it can be\r\neasily shown to the contrary by every one's experience. I shall for\r\nthis argument assume it as demonstrated that the increase of price which\r\nprotection makes is paid by the consumer. This suggests the first great\r\nobjection to protection, that it compels the consumer to pay more for\r\ngoods than they are really worth, ostensibly to help the business of a\r\nproducer. Now consumers constitute the vast majority of the people. The\r\nproducers of protected articles are few in comparison with them. It is\r\ntrue that most men are both producers and consumers. But, for the great\r\nmajority, there is little or no protection for what they produce, but\r\nlarge protection for what they consume. The tariff is principally levied\r\nupon woollen goods, lumber, furniture, stoves and other manufactured\r\narticles of iron, and upon sugar and salt. The necessities of life are\r\nweighted with the burden. It is out of the necessities of the people,\r\ntherefore, that the money is realized to support the protective system.\r\nI say, Mr. Chairman, that it is beyond the sphere of true governmental\r\npower to tax one man to help the business of another. It is, by power,\r\ntaking money from one to give it to another. This is robbery, nothing\r\nmore nor less. When a man earns a dollar it is his own; and no power of\r\nreasoning can justify the legislative power in taking it from him except\r\nfor the uses of the government.\r\n\r\nYet, Mr. Chairman, the present tariff takes hundreds of millions of\r\ndollars every year from the farmer, the laborer, and other consumers,\r\nunder the claim of enriching the manufacturer. It may not be much for\r\neach one to contribute, yet in the aggregate it is an enormous sum. For\r\nmany, too, it is very much. The statistics will show that every head of\r\na family who receives four hundred dollars a year in wages pays at least\r\none hundred dollars on account of protection. Put such a tax on all\r\nincomes and the country would be in a ferment of excitement until it was\r\nremoved. But it is upon the poor and lowly that the tax is placed,\r\nand their voices are not often heard in shaping the policies of tariff\r\nlegislation. I repeat, the product of one's labor is his own. It is his\r\nhighest right, subject only to the necessities of the government, to do\r\nwith it as he pleases. Protection invades, destroys that right. It ought\r\nto be destroyed, until every American freeman can spend his money where\r\nit will be of the most service to him.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the cost of protection to the consumer, consider its\r\noperation in increasing the price of two or three of the leading\r\narticles protected. Take paper for example. The duty on that commodity\r\nis twenty per cent. ad valorem. Most of the articles which enter\r\ninto its manufacture or are required in the process of making it are\r\nincreased in price by protection. The result is that the price of paper\r\nto the consumer is increased nearly fifteen per cent.; that is, if the\r\ntariff were taken off paper and the articles used in its manufacture,\r\npaper would be fifteen per cent. cheaper to the buyer. The paper-mills\r\nfor five years have produced nearly one hundred millions of dollars'\r\nworth of paper a year. The consumers have been compelled to pay fifteen\r\nmillions a year to the manufacturer more than the paper could have\r\nbeen bought for without the tariff. In five years this has amounted to\r\n$75,000,000, an immense sum paid to protection. It is a tax upon books\r\nand newspapers; it is a tax upon intelligence; it is a premium upon\r\nignorance. So heavy had the burden of this tax become that every\r\nnewspaper man in the district I have the honor to represent has appealed\r\nto Congress to take the duty off. The government has derived little\r\nrevenue from the paper duty. It has gone almost entirely to the\r\nmanufacturer, who himself has not been benefited as anticipated, as will\r\npresently be seen. These burdens have been imposed to protect the paper\r\nmanufacturer against the foreigner, in face of the confident prediction\r\nmade by one of the most experienced paper men in the country, that\r\nif all protection were taken off paper and the material used in its\r\nmanufacture, the manufacturer would be able to successfully compete with\r\nthe foreigner in nearly every desirable market in the world.\r\n\r\nTake blankets also for example. The tariff on coarse blankets is nearly\r\none hundred per cent. ad valorem. They can be bought in most of the\r\nmarkets of the world for two dollars a pair. Yet our poor, who use the\r\nmost of that grade of blankets, are compelled to pay about four\r\ndollars a pair. The government derives little revenue from it, as the\r\nimportation of these blankets for years has been trifling. This tax\r\nhas been a heavy burden upon the poor during this severe winter, a tax\r\nrunning into the millions to support protection. Heaven save a country\r\nfrom a system which begrudges to the shivering poor the blankets to make\r\nthem comfortable in the winter and the cold!\r\n\r\nSecondly, protection has diminished the income of the laborer from his\r\nwages. The first factor in the ascertainment of the value of wages is\r\ntheir purchasing power, or how much can be bought with them. If in one\r\ncountry the wages are five dollars a day and in another only one dollar,\r\nif the laborer can in the one country with the one dollar, purchase more\r\nof the necessary articles required in daily consumption, he, in fact,\r\nis better paid than the former in the other who gets five dollars a day.\r\nAdmit for a moment that protection raises the wages of the laborer, it\r\nalso raises the price of nearly all the necessaries of life, and what he\r\nmakes in wages he more than loses in the increase of prices of what he\r\nis obliged to buy. As already stated, a head of a family who earns $400\r\nper year is compelled to pay $100 more for what he needs, on account of\r\nprotection. What difference is it to him whether the $100 are taken out\r\nof his wages before they are paid, or taken from him afterward in the\r\nincreased price of articles he cannot get along without? In both cases\r\nhe really receives only $300 for his year's labor. The statistics show\r\nthat the average increased cost of twelve articles most required in\r\ndaily consumption in 1874 over 1860 was ninety-two per cent., while the\r\naverage increase of wages of eight artisans, cabinet-makers, coopers,\r\ncarpenters, painters, shoemakers, tail-ors, tanners, and tinsmiths, was\r\nonly sixty per cent., demonstrating that the purchasing power of labor\r\nhad under protection in thirteen years depreciated 19.5 per cent.\r\nBut protection has not even raised the nominal wages in most of the\r\nunprotected industries. I find that the wages of the farm hand, the day\r\nlaborer, and the ordinary artisan are in most places now no higher than\r\nthey were in 1860.\r\n\r\nBut it is confidently asserted that the wages of laborers in the\r\nprotected industries are higher because of protection. Admit it. I have\r\nnot the figures for 1880, but in 1870 there were not 500,000 of them;\r\nbut of the laborers in other industries there were 12,000,000, exclusive\r\nof those in agriculture, who were 6,000,000 more. Why should the wages\r\nof the half million be increased beyond their natural rate, while\r\nthose of the others remain unchanged? More--why should the wages of\r\nthe 18,000,000 be diminished that those of the half million may be\r\nincreased? For an increase cannot be made in the wage rate of one class\r\nwithout a proportionate decrease in that of others. But the wages\r\nof labor in protected industries are not permanently increased by\r\nprotection. Another very important factor in ascertaining the value\r\nof wages is the continuance or the steadiness of the employment. Two\r\ndollars a day for half the year is no more than a dollar a day for the\r\nwhole year. Employment in most protected industries is spasmodic. In the\r\nleading industries for the past ten years employment has not averaged\r\nmore than three fourths of the time, and not at very high wages. Within\r\nthe last year manufacturers of silk, carpets, nails and many other\r\narticles of iron, of various kinds of glassware and furniture, and coal\r\nproducers have shut down their works for a part of the time, or reduced\r\nthe hours of labor. Production has been too great. To stop this and\r\nprevent the reduction of profits through increasing competition, the\r\nfirst thing done is to diminish the production, thus turning employes\r\nout of employment. Wages are diminished or stopped until times are flush\r\nagain. With the time estimated in which the laborers are not at work,\r\nthe average rate of wages for the ten years preceding 1880 did not equal\r\nthe wages in similar industries for the ten years preceding 1860 under a\r\nrevenue tariff. Indeed, in many branches the wages have not been so high\r\nas those received by the pauper labor, so-called, in Europe. But it is\r\nmanifest that the wages in these industries cannot for any long period\r\nbe higher than the average rate in the community, for, if the wages be\r\nhigher, labor will crowd into the employments thus favored until the\r\nrate is brought down to the general level. So true is this, that it\r\nis admitted by many protectionists that wages are not higher in the\r\nprotected industries than in others.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the effect of protection is disastrous to most of the protected\r\nindustries themselves. We have seen that many of them have in recent\r\nyears been compelled to diminish production. The cause of this is\r\nmanifest. Production confines them to the American market. The high\r\nprices they are compelled to pay for protected materials which enter\r\ninto the manufacture of their products disable them from going into the\r\nforeign market. The profits which they make under the first impulse of\r\nprotection invite others into the same business. As a result, therefore,\r\nmore goods are made than the American market can consume. Prices go down\r\nto some extent through the competition, but rarely under the cost\r\nof production, increased, as we have seen, by the enhanced price of\r\nmaterial required. The losses threatened by such competition are sought\r\nto be averted by the diminution of production. Combinations of those\r\ninterested are formed to stop work or reduce it until the stock on hand\r\nhas been consumed. Production then begins again and continues until\r\nthe same necessity calls again for the same remedy. But this remedy is\r\narbitrary, capricious, and unsatisfactory. Some will not enter into the\r\ncombination at all. Others will secretly violate the agreement from the\r\nbeginning. Others still, when their surplus stock has been sold, and\r\nbefore the general price has risen, will begin to manufacture again.\r\nThere is no power to enforce any bargain they have made, and they find\r\nthe plan only imperfectly curing the difficulty. They remain uncertain\r\nwhat to do, embarrassed and doubtful as to the future. They have through\r\nprotection violated the natural laws of supply and demand, and human\r\nregulations are powerless to relieve them from the penalty.\r\n\r\nTake, as an illustration of the operation of the system, the article of\r\npaper. One of the first effects of the general tariff was to increase\r\nthe price of nearly every thing the manufacturer required to make the\r\npaper. Fifteen mil-lions of dollars a year through the protection are\r\ntaken from the consumer. The manufacturer himself is able to retain\r\nbut a small part of it, as he is obliged to pay to some other protected\r\nindustry for its products, they in turn to some others who furnished\r\nthem with protected articles for their use, and so on to the end. The\r\nresult is that nominal prices are raised all around; the consumers pay\r\nthe fifteen millions, while nobody receives any substantial benefit,\r\nbecause what one makes in the increased price of his product he loses\r\nin the increased price he is obliged to pay for the required products\r\nof others. The consumer is the loser, and though competition may\r\noccasionally reduce prices for him to a reasonable rate, it never to any\r\nappreciable extent compensates him for the losses he sustains through\r\nthe enhanced price which the protective system inevitably causes.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be disputed that many of the protected manufacturers have\r\ngrown rich. In very many cases I think it can be demonstrated that their\r\nwealth has resulted from some patent which has given them a monopoly in\r\nparticular branches of manufacturing, or from some other advantage which\r\nthey have employed exclusively in their business. In such cases they\r\nwould have prospered without protection as with it. I think there are\r\nfew, except in the very inception of a manufacturing enterprise, or in\r\nabnormal cases growing out of war or destruction of property, or the\r\ncombinations of large amounts of capital, where protection alone has\r\nenriched men. The result is the robbery of the consumer with no ultimate\r\ngood to most of the protective industries.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the textile manufacturers in Philadelphia the other\r\nday, one of the leading men in that interest said: \"The fact is that the\r\ntextile manufacturers of Philadelphia, the centre of the American trade,\r\nare fast approaching a crisis, and realize that something must be done,\r\nand that soon. Cotton and woollen mills are fast springing up over the\r\nSouth and West, and the prospects are that we will soon lose much of\r\nour trade in the coarse fabrics by reason of cheap competition. The\r\nonly thing we can do, therefore, is to turn our attention to the higher\r\nplane, and endeavor to make goods equal to those imported. We cannot do\r\nthis now, because we have not a sufficient supply either of the culture\r\nwhich begets designs, or of the skill which manipulates the fibres.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a commentary this upon protection, which has brought to such\r\na crisis one of the chief industries protected, and which is here\r\nconfessed to have failed, after twenty years, to enable it to compete\r\neven in our own markets with foreign goods of the finer quality! What\r\nis true of textile manufacturing is also true of many other industries.\r\nWhat remedy, then, will afford the American manufacturer relief? Not\r\nthe one here suggested of increasing the manufacture of goods of finer\r\nquality, for, aside from the impracticability of the plan, this will\r\nonly aggravate the difficulty by adding to the aggregate stock in the\r\nhome market. * * * The American demand cannot consume what they produce.\r\nThey must therefore enlarge their market or stop production. To adopt\r\nthe latter course is to invite ruin. The market cannot be increased in\r\nthis country. It must be found in other countries. Foreign markets must\r\nbe sought. But these cannot be opened as long as we close our markets\r\nto their products, with which alone, in most instances, they can buy; in\r\nother words, as long as we continue the protective system.\r\n\r\nI say, therefore, to the American manufacturer, sooner or later you\r\nmust choose between the alternatives of ruin or the abandonment of\r\nprotection. Why hesitate in the decision? Are not Canada and South\r\nAmerica and Mexico your natural markets? England now supplies them with\r\nalmost all the foreign goods they buy. Why should not you? Your coal\r\nand iron lie together in the mountain side, and can almost be dropped\r\nwithout carriage into your furnaces; while in England the miners must\r\ngo thousands of feet under the earth for those products. * * * The\r\nsituation is yours. Break down your protective barrier. All the world\r\nwill soon do the same. Their walls will disappear when ours fall. Open\r\nevery market of the world to your products; give steady employment to\r\nyour laborers. In a little while you will have the reward which nature\r\nalways gives to those who obey her laws, and will escape the ruin\r\nwhich many of your most intelligent opera-tors see impending over your\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nI have not time to-day to more than refer to the ruinous effect of\r\nprotection upon our carrying trade. In 1856, seventy-five per cent.\r\nof the total value of our imports and exports was carried in American\r\nvessels; while in 1879 but seventeen per cent. was carried in such\r\nvessels, and in 1880 the proportion was still less. In 1855, 381 ships\r\nand barks were built in the United States, while in 1879 there were\r\nonly 37. It is a question of very few years at this rate until American\r\nvessels and the American flag will disappear from the high seas.\r\nProtection has more than all else to do with the prostration of this\r\ntrade. It accomplishes this result (1) by enhancing the price of the\r\nmaterials which enter into the construction of vessels, so that our\r\nship-builders cannot compete with foreigners engaged in the same\r\nbusiness; (2) by increasing the cost of domestic production so that\r\nAmerican manufactured goods cannot profitably be exported; and (3) by\r\ndisabling our merchants from bringing back on their return trips foreign\r\ncargoes in exchange for our products.\r\n\r\nNor will I say any thing as to the increase of the crime of smuggling\r\nunder protection, a crime which has done incalculable harm to honest\r\ndealers, particularly on the border, and a crime out of which some of\r\nthe largest fortunes in the country have been made.\r\n\r\nThere are many who will admit the abstract justice of much that I have\r\nsaid who profess to believe that it will not do to disturb the\r\ntariff now. But for the protectionist that time never comes. When the\r\ndepression in business was universal, they said you must not disturb\r\nthe tariff now, because the times are so hard and there is so much\r\nsuffering. Now, when business has improved, they say you must not\r\ninterfere with the tariff, because times are good and you may bring\r\nsuffering again. When the present tariff was first levied it was\r\ndefended as a temporary expedient only, required as a necessity by war.\r\nNow that a quarter of a century nearly has passed by and peace has\r\nbeen restored for fifteen years, the advocates for protection are as\r\ndetermined to hold on to the government bounty as ever. If they are to\r\nbe consulted upon the subject as to when the people shall have relief,\r\nthe system will be perpetual.\r\n\r\nIt is said we must not disturb the tariff because we must raise so much\r\nrevenue. I do not propose to disturb it to diminish revenue, but to\r\nincrease it. The plan I propose will add one fifth at least to the\r\nrevenue of the country. It is protection I propose to get rid of, not\r\nrevenue. It has been well said that revenue ceases where protection\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that by taking away protection you will embarrass many\r\nindustries by compelling them to close up and discharge their employees.\r\nI do not believe that the changing of the present tariff to a\r\nrevenue tariff will produce this result. I believe that at once every\r\nmanufacturer will make more in the diminished cost of production than\r\nhe will lose in the taking away of protection. But if there should\r\nbe danger to any industry I would provide against it in the law which\r\nchanges the tariff so that if there should be any displacement of labor\r\nthere will be no loss in consequence.\r\n\r\nNo more perfect illustration of the effect of free trade has been shown\r\nthan in the history of the United States. Very much of our prosperity is\r\ndue to the fact that the productions of each State can be sold in every\r\nother State without restriction. During the war the most potent argument\r\nfor the cause of the Union was found in the apprehension that disunion\r\nmeant restriction of commerce, and particularly the placing of the mouth\r\nof the Mississippi River under foreign control. The war was fought,\r\ntherefore, to maintain free trade, and the victory was the triumph of\r\nfree trade. The Union every day exhibits the advantages of the system.\r\n\r\nAre these due to the accident of a State being a member of that Union\r\nor to the beneficent principle of the system itself? What would prevent\r\nsimilar results following if, subject only to the necessities of\r\ngovernment, it were extended to Mexico, to Canada, to South America, to\r\nthe world? In such extension the United States have everything to gain,\r\nnothing to lose. This country would soon become the supply house of the\r\nworld. We will soon have cattle and harvests enough for all nations.\r\nOur cotton is everywhere in demand. It is again king. Its crown has\r\nbeen restored, and in all the markets of the world it waves its royal\r\nsceptre. Out of our coal and minerals can be manufactured every thing\r\nwhich human ingenuity can devise. Our gold and silver mines will supply\r\nthe greater part of the precious metals for the use of the arts and\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nWith the opportunity of unrestricted exchange of these products, how\r\nlimitless the horizon of our possibilities! Let American adventurousness\r\nand genius be free upon the high seas, to go wherever they please and\r\nbring back whatever they please, and the oceans will swarm with American\r\nsails, and the land will laugh with the plenty within its borders. The\r\ntrade of Tyre and Sidon, the far extending commerce of the Venetian\r\nrepublic, the wealth-producing traffic of the Netherlands, will be as\r\ndreams in contrast with the stupendous reality which American enterprise\r\nwill develop in our own generation. Through the humanizing influence of\r\nthe trade thus encouraged, I see nations become the friends of nations,\r\nand the causes of war disappear. I see the influence of the great\r\nrepublic in the amelioration of the condition of the poor and the\r\noppressed in every land, and in the moderation of the arbitrariness of\r\npower. Upon the wings of free trade will be carried the seeds of free\r\ngovernment, to be scattered everywhere to grow and ripen into harvests\r\nof free peoples in every nation under the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--FINANCE AND CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the election of 1876 and the inauguration of President Hayes, March\r\n4, 1877, the Period of Reconstruction may be said to have closed. The\r\nlast formal act of that period was the withdrawal of the national troops\r\nfrom the South by President Hayes soon after his inauguration. During\r\nthe last two decades the \"Southern Question,\" while it has been\r\noccasionally prominent in political discussions,--especially in\r\nconnection with the Lodge Federal Elections Bill, 1889-91, has,\r\nnevertheless, occupied a subordinate place in public interest and\r\nattention. As an issue in serious political discussions and party\r\ndivisions the question has disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the subject of the Tariff, considered in the previous\r\nsection, public attention has been directed chiefly, during the last\r\nquarter of a century, to the two great subjects, Finance and Civil\r\nService Reform.\r\n\r\nThe Financial question has been like that of the Tariff,--it has\r\nbeen almost a constant factor in political controversies since the\r\norganization of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe financial measures of Hamilton were the chief subject of political\r\ncontroversy under our first administration, and they formed the basis\r\nof division for the first political parties under the Constitution. The\r\nfunding of the Revolutionary debt, its payment dollar for dollar\r\nwithout discrimination between the holders of the public securities,\r\nthe assumption of the State debts by the National Government, and\r\nthe establishment of the First United States Bank, these measures of\r\nHamilton were all stoutly combated by his opponents, but they were\r\nall carried to a successful conclusion. It was the discussion on the\r\nestablishment of the First United States Bank that brought from Hamilton\r\nand Jefferson their differing constructions of the Constitution. In\r\nhis argument to Washington in favor of the Bank, Hamilton presented\r\nhis famous theory of implied powers, while Jefferson contended that\r\nthe Constitution should be strictly construed, and that the \"sweeping\r\nclause\"--\"words subsidiary to limited powers\"--should not be so\r\nconstrued as to give unlimited powers. Madison and Giles in the House\r\npresented notable arguments in support of the Jeffersonian view. For\r\ntwenty years after 1791 our financial questions were chiefly questions\r\nof administration, not of legislation. In 1811 the attempt to recharter\r\nthe First United States Bank was defeated in the Senate by the casting\r\nvote of Vice-President Clinton. The financial embarrassments of the\r\nwar of 1812, however, led to the establishment, in 1812, of the second\r\nUnited States Bank,--by a law very similar in its provisions to the act\r\ncreating the First Bank in 1791. The bill chartering the Second United\r\nStates Bank was signed by Madison, who had strenuously opposed the\r\ncharter of the First Bank. The financial difficulties in which the\r\nwar had involved his administration had convinced Madison that such an\r\ninstitution as the Bank was a \"necessary and proper\" means of carrying\r\non the fiscal affairs of the Government. The Second Bank was, however,\r\nopposed on constitutional grounds, as the First had been; but in 1819 in\r\nthe famous case of McCulloch vs. Maryland, the Supreme Court sustained\r\nits constitutionality, Chief-Justice Marshall rendering the decision.\r\nThe Court held, in this notable decision, that the Federal Government\r\nwas a government of limited powers, and these powers are not to be\r\ntranscended; but wherein a power is specifically conferred Congress\r\nmight exercise a sovereign and unlimited discretion as to the means\r\nnecessary in carrying that power into operation.\r\n\r\nThe next important chapter in our financial history is the war upon the\r\nSecond United States Bank begun and conducted to a finish by President\r\nJackson. A bill rechartering the Bank was passed by Congress in 1832,\r\nfour years before its charter expired. Jackson vetoed this bill, chiefly\r\non constitutional grounds, in the face of Marshall's decision of 1819.\r\nThe political literature of Jackson's two administrations is full of\r\nthe Bank controversy, and this literature contains contributions from\r\nWebster, Clay, Calhoun, Benton, and other of the ablest public men of\r\nthe day. No subject of public discussion in that day more completely\r\nabsorbed the attention of the people.\r\n\r\nOn these important subjects, which engaged public attention during the\r\nfirst half-century of our national history, there may be found many\r\nvaluable speeches. These, however, are largely of a Constitutional\r\ncharacter. It has been since the opening of our civil war that\r\nour financial discussions have assumed their greatest interest and\r\nimportance. We can attempt here only a meagre outline of the financial\r\nhistory of the last thirty years,--a history which suggests an almost\r\ncontinuous financial struggle and debate.\r\n\r\nLeaving on one side the questions of taxation and banking, the financial\r\ndiscussion has presented itself under two aspects,--the issue and\r\nredemption of Government paper currency, and the Government policy\r\ntoward silver coinage. The issue, the funding, and the payment of\r\nGovernment bonds have been incidentally connected with these questions.\r\n\r\nThe first \"legal-tender\" Act was approved February 25, 1862. Mr. Blaine\r\nsays of this Act that it was \"the most momentous financial step ever\r\ntaken by Congress,\" and it was a step concerning which there has ever\r\nsince been the most pronounced difference of opinion. The Act provided\r\nfor the issue of $150,000,000 non-interest-bearing notes, payable\r\nto bearer, in denominations of not less than $5, and legal tender in\r\npayment of all debts, public and private, except duties on imports and\r\ninterest on the public debt. These notes were made exchangeable for 6\r\nper cent. bonds and receivable for loans that might thereafter be made\r\nby the Government. Supplementary acts of July 11, 1862, and January\r\n17, 1863, authorized additional issues of $150,000,000 each, in\r\ndenominations of not less than one dollar, and the time in which to\r\nexchange the notes for bonds was limited to July 1, 1863. It was under\r\nthese Acts that the legal-tender notes known as \"greenbacks,\" now\r\noutstanding, were issued.\r\n\r\nThe retirement of the greenbacks was begun soon after the war. On April\r\n12, 1866, an Act authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to retire and\r\ncancel not more than $10,000,000 of these notes within six months of the\r\npassage of the Act, and $4,000,000 per month thereafter. This policy of\r\ncontraction was carried out by Secretary McCulloch, who urged still more\r\nrapid contraction; but the policy was resisted by a large influence in\r\nthe country, and on February 4, 1868, an Act of Congress suspending the\r\nauthority of the Secretary of the Treasury to retire and cancel United\r\nStates notes, became a law without the signature of the President.\r\n\r\nOn March 18, 1869, an \"Act to strengthen the public credit\" was passed,\r\nwhich declared that the \"greenbacks\" were redeemable in coin. This Act\r\nconcluded as follows: \"And the United States also solemnly pledges\r\nits faith to make provision at the earliest practicable period for the\r\nredemption of the United States notes in coin.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 14, 1875, the \"Resumption Act\" was passed. It declared that\r\n\"on and after January 1, 1879, the Secretary of the Treasury shall\r\nredeem in coin the United States legal-tender notes then outstanding,\r\non their presentation for redemption at the office of the Assistant\r\nTreasurer of the United States in the city of New York, in sums of\r\nnot less than fifty dollars.\" The same Act provided that while the\r\nlegal-tender notes outstanding remained in excess of $300,000,000, the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury should redeem such notes to the amount of 80\r\nper cent. of the increase in National Bank notes issued.\r\n\r\nOn May 31, 1878, an Act was passed forbidding the further retirement of\r\nUnited States legal-tender notes, and providing that \"when any of said\r\nnotes may be redeemed or be received into the Treasury under any law\r\nfrom any source whatever and shall belong to the United States, they\r\nshall not be retired, cancelled, or destroyed, but they shall be\r\nre-issued and paid out again and kept in circulation.\" When this Act was\r\npassed there were $346,681,016 of United States notes outstanding, and\r\nthere has been no change in the amount since.\r\n\r\nAs to the silver policy of the Government since the war it is expected\r\nthat the purport of certain important acts of legislation should be\r\nunderstood by all who would have an intelligent conception of our\r\nfinancial controversies.\r\n\r\nThe Act of February 12, 1873, suspended the coinage of the standard\r\nsilver dollar of 412 and 1/2 grains. This Act authorized the coinage of\r\nthe trade dollar of 420 grains, making it a legal tender for $5. This\r\nis the Act which has been called the \"crime of 1873,\" on which tomes of\r\ncontroversy have been called forth. It is discussed at some length in\r\nthe speech of Mr. Morrill, found in our text.\r\n\r\nOn February 28, 1878, the Bland-Allison Act was passed over the veto of\r\nPresident Hayes. A bill providing for the free and unlimited coinage\r\nof silver, of 412 and 1/2 grains to the dollar, had passed the House\r\nin November, 1877, under a suspension of the rules. At this time the\r\nbullion in the silver dollar was worth about 92 cents. When the Bland\r\nfree-coinage Act came to the Senate, it was amended there on report\r\nof Senator Allison, of Iowa, Chairman of the Finance Committee of\r\nthe Senate, by a provision that the Government should purchase from\r\n$2,000,000 to $4,000,000 worth of silver bullion for coinage into\r\ndollars. Holders of the coin were authorized to deposit the same with\r\nthe United States Treasurer and to receive therefor certificates of\r\ndeposit, known as silver certificates. These certificates are not legal\r\ntender, although receivable for customs, taxes, and all public dues, and\r\nare redeemable only in silver. This Act called forth an exhaustive\r\nand able debate. Senator Morrill, of Vermont, opened the debate in\r\nopposition to silver coinage. Senator Beck, of Kentucky, was one of\r\nthe ablest advocates of silver coinage, while Mr. Blaine made a notable\r\ncontribution to the debate, in which he favored the unlimited coinage of\r\na silver dollar of 425 grains. Preceding the Congressional action there\r\nhad been much public discussion on the subject throughout the country.\r\nA Monetary Commission had been organized, by joint resolution of August\r\n15, 1875, for the purpose of making an examination into the silver\r\nquestion. This Commission made an exhaustive report to Congress on March\r\n2, 1877, the majority of the Commission recommending the resumption of\r\nsilver coinage. Also, previous to the discussion of the Bland-Allison\r\nAct in the Senate, the celebrated Matthews Resolution was passed by that\r\nbody. This asserted that \"all bonds of the United States are payable in\r\nsilver dollars of 412 and 1/2 grains, and that to restore such dollars\r\nas a full legal tender for that purpose, is not in violation of public\r\nfaith or the rights of the creditors.\" The de-bate on this resolution\r\nwas a notable one. It was chiefly under these aspects that the financial\r\nquestion was discussed in the years 1877-1878.\r\n\r\nThe Bland-Allison Act was in operation from 1878 to 1890, during which\r\ntime $2,000,000 in silver were coined per month, the minimum amount\r\nauthorized by law. On July 14, 1890, the so-called Sherman Act stopped\r\nthe coinage of silver dollars and provided for the purchase of silver\r\nbullion to the amount of 4,500,000 ounces per month. Against this\r\nbullion Treasury notes were to be issued, redeemable in gold or silver\r\ncoin at the option of the Secretary of the Treasury. These notes were\r\nmade a legal tender in payment of all debts, public and private, and\r\nreceivable for all customs, taxes, and all public dues. It was also\r\ndeclared in this Act to be the established policy of the United States\r\nto maintain the two metals on a parity with each other upon the present\r\nlegal ratio, or such ratio as may be provided by law. On account of this\r\nlanguage in the law the Secretary of the Treasury under Mr. Cleveland\r\nhas not deemed it advisable to exercise the discretion which the law\r\ngives him to redeem these notes in silver, and these new Treasury notes\r\nhave been treated as gold obligations. By November 1, 1893, when the\r\nsilver purchase clause of the Act of July 14, 1890, was repealed,\r\nTreasury notes to the amount of $155,000,000 had been issued, though\r\nsome of these have since been exchanged for silver dollars at the option\r\nof the holders. It has been by these Treasury notes and the outstanding\r\ngreenbacks that gold has been withdrawn from the Treasury, thus\r\ndepleting the gold reserve and making bond issues necessary. It has\r\nbeen deemed advisable by successive administrations of the Treasury\r\nDepartment to maintain a gold reserve of $100,000,000 against the\r\n$346,681,000 outstanding greenbacks, though no law requires that such\r\na reserve should be maintained further than that the Act of March 18,\r\n1869, pledges the faith of the United States that its outstanding notes\r\nshould be redeemed in coin.\r\n\r\nThe repeal of the silver purchase clause of the Sherman Act was\r\naccomplished in a special session of Congress, November 1, 1893. Since\r\nthis repeal, the silver policy of the Government has been as it\r\nwas before the Bland-Allison Act of 1878, which involves a complete\r\nsuspension of silver coinage. The Acts of 1878 and of 1890 were\r\ncompromise measures, agreed to by the opponents of silver coinage in\r\norder to prevent the passage of a bill providing for full unlimited\r\ncoinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1. Speaking in his\r\n_Recollections_ of the situation in 1890, Senator Sherman says: \"The\r\nsituation at that time was critical. A large majority of the Senate\r\nfavored free silver, and it was feared that the small majority against\r\nit in the other House might yield and agree to it. The silence of the\r\nPresident on the matter gave rise to an apprehension that if a free\r\ncoinage bill should pass both Houses he would not feel at liberty to\r\nveto it. Some action had to be taken to prevent a return to free silver\r\ncoinage, and the measure evolved was the best obtainable. I voted for\r\nit, but the day it became a law I was ready to repeal it, if repeal\r\ncould be had without substituting in its place absolute free coinage.\"\r\n\r\nSince 1893 the contention has been carried on by the silver men in a\r\npublic agitation in favor of free silver coinage, without compromise or\r\ninternational agreement, and this year (1896), by our form of political\r\nreferendum, the question has been referred to the people for decision.\r\n\r\nWe have attempted to include four representative orations on this\r\ncomplex subject, from four of our most prominent public men. The\r\nliterature of the subject is unlimited. Mr. Morrill is a representative\r\nadvocate of the gold standard. In the same discussion Mr. Blaine offers\r\na compromise position. Senator Sherman is an international bimetallist\r\nand a pronounced opponent of independent silver coinage. He has given\r\nmuch attention--probably no one has given more--to financial questions\r\nduring a long public life. Senator Jones is recognized as one of the\r\nablest advocates and one of the deepest students of monetary problems\r\non the free silver side of the controversy. The extracts from these\r\nspeeches will indicate the merits of the long debate on silver\r\ncoinage,--the greatest question in our financial history in a quarter of\r\na century.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reform of the Civil Service has been a subject of public attention\r\nespecially since 1867. The public service of the United States is\r\ndivided into three branches, the civil, military, and naval. By the\r\ncivil service we mean that which is neither military nor naval, and it\r\ncomprises all the offices by which the civil administration is carried\r\non. The struggle for Civil Service Reform has been an effort to\r\nsubstitute what is known as the \"Merit System\" for what is known as the\r\n\"Spoils System\"; to require that appointment to public office should\r\ndepend, not upon the applicant's having rendered a party service, but\r\nupon his fitness to render a public service. It would seem that the\r\nestablishment in public practice of so obvious a principle should\r\nrequire no contest or agitation; and that the civil service should ever\r\nhave been perverted and that a long struggle should be necessary to\r\nreform it, are to be explained only in connection with a modern party\r\norganization and a party machinery and usage which were entirely\r\nunforeseen by the framers of the Constitution. The practice of the\r\nearly administrations was reasonable and natural. Washington required of\r\napplicants for places in the civil service proofs of ability, integrity,\r\nand fitness. \"Beyond this,\" he said, \"nothing with me is necessary\r\nor will be of any avail.\" Washington did not dream that party service\r\nshould be considered as a reason for a public appointment. John Adams\r\nfollowed the example of Washington. Jefferson came into power at the\r\nhead of a victorious party which had displaced its opponent after a\r\nbitter struggle. The pressure for places was strong, but Jefferson\r\nresisted it, and he declared in a famous utterance that \"the only\r\nquestions concerning a candidate shall be, Is he honest? is he capable?\r\nis he faithful to the Constitution?\" Madison, Monroe, and John\r\nQuincy Adams followed in the same practice so faithfully that a joint\r\nCongressional Committee was led to say in 1868 that, having consulted\r\nall accessible means of information, they had not learned of a single\r\nremoval of a subordinate officer except for cause, from the beginning of\r\nWashington's administration to the close of that of John Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\nThe change came in 1829 with the accession of Jackson. The Spoils System\r\nwas formally proclaimed in 1832. In that year Martin Van Buren was\r\nnominated Minister to England, and, in advocating his confirmation,\r\nSenator Marcy, of New York, first used the famous phrase in reference to\r\nthe public officers, \"To the victors belong the spoils of the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nSince then every administration has succumbed, in whole or in part,\r\nto the Spoils System. The movement for the reform of the civil service\r\nbegan in 1867-68, in the 39th and 40th Congresses in investigations and\r\nreports of a Joint Committee on Retrenchment. The reports were made and\r\nthe movement led by Hon. Thomas A. Jenckes, a member of the House from\r\nRhode Island. These reports contained a mass of valuable information\r\nupon the evils of the spoils service. In 1871 an Act, a section of an\r\nappropriation bill, was passed authorizing the President to prescribe\r\nrules for admission to the civil service, to appoint suitable persons\r\nto make inquiries and to establish regulations for the conduct of\r\nappointees. Mr. George William Curtis was at the head of the Civil\r\nService Commission appointed by General Grant under this Act, and on\r\nDecember 18, 1871, the Commission made a notable report, written by Mr.\r\nCurtis, on the evils of the present system and the need of reform. In\r\nApril, 1872, a set of rules was promulgated by the Commission regulating\r\nappointments. These rules were suspended in March, 1875, by President\r\nGrant although personally friendly to the reform, because Congress had\r\nrefused appropriations for the expenses of the Commission. Appeal\r\nwas made to the people through the usual agencies of education and\r\nagitation. President Hayes revised the Civil Service Rules, and Mr.\r\nSchurz, Secretary of the Interior, made notable application of the\r\nprinciple of the reform in his department. President Garfield recognized\r\nthe need of reform, though he asserted that it could be brought about\r\nonly through Congressional action. Garfield's assassination by a\r\ndisappointed placeman added to the public demand for reform, and on\r\nJanuary, 18, 1883, the Pendleton Civil Service Law was passed. This\r\nAct, which had been pending in the Senate since 1880, provided for\r\nopen competitive examinations for admission to the public service in\r\nWashington and in all custom-houses and post-offices where the official\r\nforce numbered as many as fifty; for the appointment of a Civil Service\r\nCommission of three members, not more than two of whom shall be of\r\nthe same political party; and for the apportionment of appointments\r\naccording to the population of the States. Provision was made for a\r\nperiod of probation before permanent appointment should be made, and no\r\nrecommendations from a Senator or member of Congress, except as to\r\nthe character or residence of the applicant, should be received or\r\nconsidered by any person making an appointment or examination. The Act\r\nprohibited political assessments in a provision that \"no person shall,\r\nin any room occupied in the discharge of official duties by an officer\r\nor employee of the United States, solicit in any manner whatever any\r\ncontribution of money or anything of value, for any political purpose\r\nwhatever.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pendleton Act was a landmark in the history of the reform and\r\nindicated its certain triumph. The Act was faithfully executed by\r\nPresident Arthur in the appointment of a Commission friendly to the\r\ncause, and under the Act the Civil Service Rules have since been\r\nextended by Presidents Harrison and Cleveland until the operations of\r\nthe reform embrace the greater part of the service, including fully\r\n85,000 appointments. It is not probable that the nation will ever again\r\nreturn to the feudalism of the Spoils System.\r\n\r\nNo two men have done more for the cause of Civil Service Reform than\r\nGeorge William Curtis and Carl Schurz. When Mr. Curtis died, in 1892,\r\nthe presidency of the Civil Service Reform League, so long held by\r\nhim, worthily devolved upon Mr. Schurz. It may be said that in the last\r\ntwenty-five years of Mr. Curtis' life is written the history of\r\nthis reform. His orations on the subject have enriched our political\r\nliterature and they hold up before the young men of America the noblest\r\nideals of American citizenship. He gave unselfishly of his time and of\r\nhis exalted talents to this cause, and his services deserve from his\r\ncountrymen the reward due to high and devoted patriotism. Refusing high\r\nand honorable appointments which were held out to him, he preferred to\r\nserve his country by doing what he could to put her public service upon\r\na worthy plane. The oration from Mr. Curtis included in our text is one\r\namong many of his worthy productions.\r\n\r\nJ. A. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTIN S. MORRILL,\r\n\r\nOF VERMONT. (BORN 1810.)\r\n\r\nON THE REMONETIZATION OF SILVER\r\n\r\n--UNITED STATES SENATE, JANUARY 28, 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT, the bill now before the Senate provides for the\r\nresuscitation of the obsolete dollar of 412 and 1/2 grains of silver,\r\nwhich Congress entombed in 1834 by an Act which diminished the weight of\r\ngold coins to the extent of 6.6 per cent., and thus bade a long farewell\r\nto silver. It is to be a dollar made of metal worth now fifty-three and\r\nfive-eighths pence per ounce, or ten cents less in value than a\r\ngold dollar, and on January 23d, awkwardly enough, worth eight and\r\nthree-fourths cents less than a dollar in greenbacks, gold being only\r\nIf per cent. premium, but, nevertheless, to be a legal tender for all\r\ndebts, public and private, except where otherwise provided by contract.\r\nThe words seem to be aptly chosen to override and annul whatever now\r\nmay be otherwise provided by law. Beyond this, as the bill came from the\r\nHouse, the holders of silver bullion--not the Government or the whole\r\npeople--were to have all the profits of coinage and the Government all\r\nof the expense. This, but for the amendment proposed by the Committee on\r\nFinance, would have furnished the power to the enterprising operators in\r\nsilver, either at home or abroad, to inflate the currency without limit;\r\nand, even as amended, inflation will be secured to the full extent\r\nof all the silver which may be issued, for there is no provision for\r\nredeeming or retiring a single dollar of paper currency. Labor is\r\nthreatened with a continuation of the unequal struggle against a\r\ndepreciated and fluctuating standard of money.\r\n\r\nThe bill, if it becomes a law, must at the very threshold arrest the\r\nresumption of specie payments, for, were the holders of United States\r\nnotes suddenly willing to exchange them for much less than their present\r\nvalue, payment even in silver is to be postponed indefinitely. For years\r\nUnited States notes have been slowly climbing upward, but now they are\r\nto have a sudden plunge downward, and in every incompleted\r\ncontract, great and small, the robbery of Peter to pay Paul is to be\r\nfore-ordained. The whole measure looks to me like a fearful assault upon\r\nthe public credit. The losses it will inflict upon the holders of paper\r\nmoney and many others will be large, and if the bill, without further\r\nradical amendments, obtains the approval of the Senate, it will give\r\nthe death-blow to the cardinal policy of the country, which now seeks\r\na large reduction of the rate of interest upon our national debt.\r\nEven that portion now held abroad will come back in a stampede to be\r\nexchanged for gold at any sacrifice. The ultimate result would be,\r\nwhen the supply for customs shall have been coined and the first\r\neffervescence has passed away, the emission of silver far below the\r\nstandard of gold; and when the people become tired of it, disgusted or\r\nruined by its instability, as they soon would be, a fresh clamor may\r\nbe expected for the remonetization of gold, and another clipping or\r\ndebasing of gold coins may follow to bring them again into circulation\r\non the basis of silver equivalency. In this slippery descent there can\r\nbe no stopping place. The consoling philosophy of the silver commission\r\nmay then be repealed, that a fall in the value of either or both of the\r\nmetals is a \"benefaction to mankind.\" If that were true, then copper,\r\nbeing more abundant and of lower value, should be used in preference\r\nto either gold or silver. The gravity of these questions will not be\r\ndisputed.\r\n\r\nThe silver question in its various aspects, as involved in the bill\r\nbefore us, is one of admitted importance, possibly of difficult\r\nsolution; and it is further embarrassed by not only the conflicting\r\nviews of those entitled to some respect, but by the multifarious\r\nprescriptions intruded by a host of self-constituted experts and by all\r\nof the quack financiers of the land. Every crocheteer and pamphleteer,\r\ncocksure \"there's no two ways about it,\" generously contributes his\r\nadvice free of charge; but sound, trust-worthy advice does not roam like\r\ntramps and seldom comes uninvited. Many of the facts which surround\r\nthe subject are perhaps of too recent occurrence to justify hasty and\r\nirrevocable conclusions. The service of our own people, however, must\r\nbe our paramount concern. Their intercourse with themselves and with\r\nthe world should be placed upon the most solid foundation. If any have\r\nsilver to sell it is comparatively a small matter, and yet we earnestly\r\ndesire that they may obtain for it the highest as well as the most\r\nstable price; but not at the expense of corn, cotton, and wheat; and it\r\nis to be hoped, if any have debts to meet now or hereafter, that they\r\nmay meet them with the least inconvenience consistent with plain,\r\ndownright, integrity; but, from being led astray by the loud\r\ndeclamations of those who earn nothing themselves and know no trade but\r\nspoliation of the earnings of others, let them heartily say, \"Good Lord,\r\ndeliver us.\"\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nA stupid charge, heretofore, in the front of debate, has been made,\r\nand wickedly repeated in many places, that the Coinage Act of 1873 was\r\nsecretly and clandestinely engineered through Congress without proper\r\nconsideration or knowledge of its contents; but it is to be noted that\r\nthis charge had its birth and growth years after the passage of the Act,\r\nand not until after the fall of silver. Long ago it was declared by one\r\nof the old Greek dramatists that, \"No lie ever grows old.\" This one is\r\nas fresh and boneless now as at its birth, and is therefore swallowed\r\nwith avidity by those to whom such food is nutritious or by those who\r\nhave no appetite for searching the documents and records for facts.\r\nWhether the Act itself was right or wrong does not depend upon the\r\ndegradation of Congress implied in the original charge. Interested\r\noutsiders may glory in libelling Congress, but why should its own\r\nmembers? The Act may be good and Congress bad, and yet it is to be hoped\r\nthat the latter has not fallen to the level of its traducers. But there\r\nhas been no fall of Congress; only a fall of silver. To present the\r\nabundant evidence showing that few laws were ever more openly proposed,\r\nyear after year, and squarely understood than the Coinage Act of 1873,\r\nwill require but a moment. It had been for years elaborately considered\r\nand reported upon by the Deputy Comptroller of the Currency. The special\r\nattention of Congress was called to the bill and the report by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury in his annual re-ports for 1870, 1871, and\r\n1872, where the \"new features\" of the bill, \"discontinuing the\r\ncoinage of the silver dollar,\" were fully set forth. The extensive\r\ncorrespondence of the Department had been printed in relation to the\r\nproposed bill, and widely circulated. The bill was separately printed\r\neleven times, and twice in reports of the Deputy Comptroller of the\r\nCurrency,--thirteen times in all,--and so printed by order of Congress.\r\nA copy of the printed bill was many times on the table of every\r\nSenator, and I now have all of them here before me in large type. It was\r\nconsidered at much length by the appropriate committees of both Houses\r\nof Congress; and the debates at different times upon the bill in\r\nthe Senate filled sixty-six columns of the _Globe_, and in the House\r\nseventy-eight columns of the _Globe_. No argus-eyed debater objected by\r\nany amendment to the discontinuance of the silver dollar. In substance\r\nthe bill twice passed each House, and was finally agreed upon and\r\nreported by a very able and trustworthy committee of conference, where\r\nMr. Sherman, Mr. Scott, and Mr. Bayard appeared on the part of the\r\nSenate. No one who knows anything of those eminent Senators will charge\r\nthem with doing anything secretly or clandestinely. And yet more capital\r\nhas been made by the silver propagandists out of this groundless charge\r\nthan by all of their legitimate arguments.'\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe gold standard, it may confidently be asserted, is practically\r\nfar cheaper than that of silver. I do not insist upon having the gold\r\nstandard, but if we are to have but one, I think that the best. The\r\nexpense of maintaining a metallic currency is of course greater than\r\nthat of paper; but it must be borne in mind that a paper currency is\r\nonly tolerable when convertible at the will of the holder into coin--and\r\nno one asks for more than that. A metallic currency is also subject\r\nto considerable loss by abrasion or the annual wear; and it is quite\r\nimportant to know which metal--gold or silver--can be most cheaply\r\nsupported. A careful examination of the subject conclusively shows that\r\nthe loss is nearly in proportion to the length of time coins have been\r\nin circulation, and to the amount of surface exposed, although small\r\ncoins, being handled with less care, suffer most. The well-ascertained\r\nresult is that it costs from fifteen to twenty-five times more to keep\r\nsilver afloat than it does to maintain the same amount in gold. To\r\nsustain the silver standard would annually cost about one per cent. for\r\nabrasion; but that of gold would not exceed one-twentieth of one per\r\ncent. This is a trouble-some charge, forever to bristle up in the\r\npath-way of a silver standard. It must also be borne in mind that the\r\nmint cost of coining silver is many times greater than that of the same\r\namount in gold. More than sixteen tons of silver are required as the\r\nequivalent of one ton of gold. As a cold matter of fact, silver is\r\nneither the best nor the cheapest standard. It is far dearer to plant\r\nand forever dearer to maintain.\r\n\r\nA double standard put forth by us on the terms now proposed by the\r\ncommission or by the House bill would be so only in name. The perfect\r\ndual ideal of theorists, based upon an exact equilibrium of values,\r\ncannot be realized while the intrinsic value of either of the component\r\nparts is overrated or remains a debatable question and everywhere more\r\nor less open to suspicion. A standard of value linked to the changing\r\nfortunes of two metals instead of one, when combined with an existing\r\ndisjointed and all-pervading confusion in the ratio of value, must\r\nnecessarily be linked to the hazard of double perturbations and become\r\nan alternating standard in perpetual motion.\r\n\r\nThe bimetallic scheme, with silver predominant--largely everywhere else\r\nsuspended, if not repudiated--is pressed upon us now with a ratio that\r\nwill leave nothing in circulation but silver, as a profitable mode of\r\nproviding a new and cheaper way of pinching and paying the national\r\ndebt; but a mode which would leave even a possible cloud upon our\r\nnational credit should find neither favor nor tolerance among a proud\r\nand independent people.\r\n\r\nThe proposition is openly and squarely made to pay the public debt at\r\nour option in whichever metal, gold or silver, happens to be cheapest,\r\nand chiefly for the reason that silver already happens to be at 10 per\r\ncent. the cheapest. In 1873, to have paid the debt in silver would have\r\ncost 3 per cent. more than to have paid it in gold, and then there was\r\nno unwillingness on the part of the present non-contents to pay in gold.\r\nSilver was worth more then to sell than to pay on debts. No one then\r\npulled out the hair of his head to cure grief for the disappearance of\r\nthe nominal silver option. Since that time it has been and would be now\r\ncheaper nominally to pay in silver if we had it; and therefore we are\r\nurged to repudiate our former action and to claim the power to resume an\r\noption already once supposed to have been profitably exercised, of which\r\nthe world was called upon to take notice, and to pay in silver to-day\r\nor to let it alone to-morrow. I know that the detestable doctrine of\r\nMachiavelli was that \"a prudent prince ought not to keep his word except\r\nwhen he can do it without injury to himself;\" but the Bible teaches a\r\ndifferent doctrine, and honoreth him \"who sweareth to his own hurt and\r\nchangeth not.\" If we would not multiply examples of individual\r\nfinancial turpitude, already painfully numerous, we must not trample out\r\nconscience and sound morality from the monetary affairs of the nation.\r\nThe \"option\" about which we should be most solicitous was definitely\r\nexpressed by Washington when he said: \"There is an option left to\r\nthe United States whether they will be respectable and prosperous or\r\ncontemptible and miserable as a nation.\" Our national self-respect would\r\nnot be increased when Turkey, as a debt-paying nation, shall be held\r\nas our equal and Mexico as our superior. The credit of a great nation\r\ncannot even be discussed without some loss; it cannot even be tempted\r\nby the devious advantages of legal technicalities without bringing some\r\nsense of shame; but to live, it must go, like chastity, unchallenged and\r\nunsuspected. It cannot take refuge behind the fig-leaves of the law, and\r\nespecially not behind a law yet to be made to meet the case.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe argument relied upon in favor of a bimetallic standard as against\r\na monometallic seems to be that a single-metal standard leaves out\r\none-half of the world's resources; but the same thing must occur with a\r\nbimetallic standard unless the metals can be placed and kept in a state\r\nof exact equilibrium, or so that nothing can be gained by the exchange\r\nof one for the other. Hitherto this has been an unattainable perfection.\r\nA law fixing the ratio of 16 of silver to 1 of gold, as proposed by\r\ndifferent members of the Commission, would now be a gross over-valuation\r\nof silver and wholly exclude gold from circulation. It will hardly be\r\ndisputed that the two metals cannot circulate together unless they are\r\nmutually convertible without profit or loss at the ratio fixed at the\r\nmint. But it is here proposed to start silver with a large legal-tender\r\nadvantage above its market value, and with the probability, through\r\nfurther depreciation, of increasing that advantage by which the\r\nmonometallic standard of silver will be ordained and confirmed. The\r\nargument in behalf of a double standard is double-tongued, when in\r\nfact nothing is intended, or can be the outcome, but a single silver\r\nstandard. The argument would wed silver and gold, but the conditions\r\nwhich follow amount to a decree of perpetual divorcement. Enforce the\r\nmeasure by legislation, and gold would at once flee out of the country.\r\nLike liberty, gold never stays where it is undervalued.\r\n\r\nNo approach to a bimetallic currency of uniform and fixed value can be\r\npossible, as it appears to me, without the co-operation of the leading\r\ncommercial nations. Even with that co-operation its accomplishment and\r\npermanence may not be absolutely certain, unless the late transcendent\r\nfickleness of the supply and demand subsides, or unless the ratio of\r\nvalue can be adjusted with more consummate accuracy than has hitherto\r\nbeen found by any single nation to be practicable. One-tenth of one per\r\ncent. difference will always exclude from use one or the other metal;\r\nbut here a difference nearly one hundred times greater has been\r\nproposed. The double-standard nations and the differing single gold- or\r\nsilver-standard nations doubtless contributed something to the relative\r\nequalization of values so long as they furnished an available market for\r\nany surplus of either metal, but this they are doing no longer. Silver,\r\nthough not yet universally demonetized, is thrown upon the market in\r\nsuch masses and from so many prolific sources as to be governed by the\r\ninexorable laws of demand and supply. Its magic as coin, if it has not\r\nhopelessly departed, has been, like the retreating soldier, fearfully\r\n\"demoralized,\" and is passing to the rear.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIt cannot be for the interest or the honor of the United States, while\r\npossessed of any healthy national pride, to resort to any expedient of\r\nbankrupt governments to lower the money standard of the country. That\r\nstandard should keep us \"four square\" to the world and give us equal\r\nrank in the advanced civilization and industrial enterprise of all the\r\ngreat commercial nations.\r\n\r\nI have failed of my purpose if I have not shown that there has been\r\nso large an increase of the stock of silver as of itself to effect a\r\npositive reduction of its value; and that this result has been confirmed\r\nand made irreversible by the new and extensive European disuse of silver\r\ncoinage. I have indicated the advisability of obtaining the co-operation\r\nof other leading nations, in fixing upon a common ratio of value between\r\ngold and silver, before embarking upon a course of independent action\r\nfrom which there could be no retreat. I have also attempted to show\r\nthat, even in the lowest pecuniary sense of profit, the Government of\r\nthe United States could not be the gainer by proposing to pay either the\r\npublic debt or the United States notes in silver; that such a payment\r\nwould violate public pledges as to the whole, and violates existing\r\nstatutes as to all that part of the debt contracted since 1870, and for\r\nwhich gold has been received; that the remonetization of silver means\r\nthe banishment of gold and our degradation among nations to the second\r\nor third rank; that it would be a sweeping 10 per cent. reduction of\r\nall duties upon imports, requiring the imposition of new taxes to that\r\nextent; that it would prevent the further funding of the public debt at\r\na lower rate of interest and give to the present holders of our 6 per\r\ncent. bonds a great advantage; that, instead of aiding resumption, it\r\nwould only inflate a currency already too long depreciated, and consign\r\nit to a still lower deep; that, instead of being a tonic to spur idle\r\ncapital once more into activity, it would be its bane, destructive of\r\nall vitality; and that as a permanent silver standard it would not\r\nonly be void of all stability, and the dearest and clumsiest in its\r\nintroduction and maintenance, but that it would reduce the wages of\r\nlabor to the full extent of the difference there might be between its\r\npurchasing power and that of gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES G. BLAINE,\r\n\r\nOF MAINE. (BORN 1830, DIED 1893.)\r\n\r\nON THE REMONETIZATION OF SILVER,\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATE, FEBRUARY 7, 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discussion on the question of remonetizing silver, Mr. President,\r\nhas been prolonged, able, and exhaustive. I may not expect to add much\r\nto its value, but I promise not to add much to its length. I shall\r\nendeavor to consider facts rather than theories, to state conclusions\r\nrather than arguments:\r\n\r\nFirst. I believe gold and silver coin to be the money of the\r\nConstitution--indeed, the money of the American people anterior to\r\nthe Constitution, which that great organic law recognized as quite\r\nindependent of its own existence. No power was conferred on Congress to\r\ndeclare that either metal should not be money. Congress has therefore,\r\nin my judgment, no power to demonetize silver any more than to\r\ndemonetize gold; no power to demonetize either any more than to\r\ndemonetize both. In this statement I am but repeating the weighty dictum\r\nof the first of constitutional lawyers. \"I am certainly of opinion,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Webster, \"that gold and silver, at rates fixed by Congress,\r\nconstitute the legal standard of value in this country, and that neither\r\nCongress nor any State has authority to establish any other standard or\r\nto displace this standard.\" Few persons can be found, I apprehend, who\r\nwill maintain that Congress possesses the power to demonetize both\r\ngold and silver, or that Congress could be justified in prohibiting the\r\ncoinage of both; and yet in logic and legal construction it would be\r\ndifficult to show where and why the power of Congress over silver is\r\ngreater than over gold--greater over either than over the two. If,\r\ntherefore, silver has been demonetized, I am in favor of remonetizing\r\nit. If its coinage has been prohibited, I am in favor of ordering It\r\nto be resumed. If it has been restricted, I am in favor of having it\r\nenlarged.\r\n\r\nSecond. What power, then, has Congress over gold and silver? It has\r\nthe exclusive power to coin them; the exclusive power to regulate their\r\nvalue; very great, very wise, very necessary powers, for the discreet\r\nexercise of which a critical occasion has now arisen. However men may\r\ndiffer about causes and processes, all will admit that within a few\r\nyears a great disturbance has taken place in the relative values of gold\r\nand silver, and that silver is worth less or gold is worth more in\r\nthe money markets of the world in 1878 than in 1873, when the further\r\ncoinage of silver dollars was prohibited in this country. To remonetize\r\nit now as though the facts and circumstances of that day were\r\nsurrounding us, is to wilfully and blindly deceive ourselves. If our\r\ndemonetization were the only cause for the decline in the value of\r\nsilver, then remonetization would be its proper and effectual cure. But\r\nother causes, quite beyond our control, have been far more potentially\r\noperative than the simple fact of Congress prohibiting its further\r\ncoinage; and as legislators we are bound to take cognizance of these\r\ncauses. The demonetization of silver in the great German Empire and the\r\nconsequent partial, or well-nigh complete, suspension of coinage in the\r\ngovernments of the Latin Union, have been the leading dominant causes\r\nfor the rapid decline in the value of silver. I do not think the\r\nover-supply of silver has had, in comparison with these other causes,\r\nan appreciable influence in the decline of its value, because its\r\nover-supply with respect to gold in these later years, has not been\r\nnearly so great as was the over-supply of gold with respect to silver\r\nfor many years after the mines of California and Australia were opened;\r\nand the over-supply of gold from those rich sources did not effect the\r\nrelative positions and uses of the two metals in any European country.\r\n\r\nI believe then if Germany were to remonetize silver and the kingdoms and\r\nstates of the Latin Union were to reopen their mints, silver would at\r\nonce resume its former relation with gold. The European countries when\r\ndriven to full re-monetization, as I believe they will be, must of\r\nnecessity adopt their old ratio of fifteen and a half of silver to one\r\nof gold, and we shall then be compelled to adopt the same ratio instead\r\nof our former sixteen to one. For if we fail to do this we shall, as\r\nbefore, lose our silver, which like all things else seeks the highest\r\nmarket; and if fifteen and a half pounds of silver will buy as much gold\r\nin Europe as sixteen pounds will buy in America, the silver, of course,\r\nwill go to Europe. But our line of policy in a joint movement with other\r\nnations to remonetize is very simple and very direct. The difficult\r\nproblem is what we shall do when we aim to re-establish silver without\r\nthe co-operation of European powers, and really as an advance movement\r\nto coerce them there into the same policy. Evidently the first dictate\r\nof prudence is to coin such a dollar, as will not only do justice\r\namong our citizens at home, but will prove a protection--an absolute\r\nbarricade--against the gold monometallists of Europe, who, whenever the\r\nopportunity offers, will quickly draw from us the one hundred and sixty\r\nmillions of gold coin still in our midst. And if we coin a silver dollar\r\nof full legal tender, obviously below the current value of the gold\r\ndollar, we are opening wide our doors and inviting Europe to take our\r\ngold. And with our gold flowing out from us we are forced to the single\r\nsilver standard and our relations with the leading commercial countries\r\nof the world are at once embarrassed and crippled.\r\n\r\nThird. The question before Congress then--sharply defined in the pending\r\nHouse bill--is, whether it is now safe and expedient to offer free\r\ncoinage to the silver dollar of 412 1/2 grains, with the mints of the\r\nLatin Union closed and Germany not permitting silver to be coined\r\nas money. At current rates of silver, the free coinage of a dollar\r\ncontaining 412 1/2 grains, worth in gold about ninety-two cents, gives\r\nan illegitimate profit to the owner of the bullion, enabling him to take\r\nninety-two cents' worth of it to the mint and get it stamped as coin and\r\nforce his neighbor to take it for a full dollar. This is an undue and\r\nunfair advantage which the Government has no right to give to the owner\r\nof silver bullion, and which defrauds the man who is forced to take the\r\ndollar. And it assuredly follows that if we give free coinage to this\r\ndollar of inferior value and put it in circulation, we do so at the\r\nexpense of our better coinage in gold; and unless we expect the uniform\r\nand invariable experience of other nations to be in some mysterious way\r\nsuspended for our peculiar benefit, we inevitably lose our gold coin.\r\nIt will flow out from us with the certainty and resistless force of the\r\ntides. Gold has indeed remained with us in considerable amount during\r\nthe circulation of the inferior currency of the legal tender; but that\r\nwas because there were two great uses reserved by law for gold: the\r\ncollection of customs and the payment of interest on the public debt.\r\nBut if the inferior silver coin is also to be used for these two\r\nreserved purposes, then gold has no tie to bind it to us. What gain,\r\ntherefore, would we make for the circulating medium, if on opening the\r\ngate for silver to flow in, we open a still wider gate for gold to flow\r\nout? If I were to venture upon a dictum on the silver question, I would\r\ndeclare that until Europe remonetizes we cannot afford to coin a dollar\r\nas low as 412 1/2 grains. After Europe remonetizes on the old standard,\r\nwe cannot afford to coin a dollar above 400 grains. If we coin too low a\r\ndollar before general re-monetization our gold will flow out from us. If\r\nwe coin too high a dollar after general remonetization our silver will\r\nleave us. It is only an equated value both before and after general\r\nremonetization that will preserve both gold and silver to us.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nFifth. The responsibility of re-establishing silver in its ancient and\r\nhonorable place as money in Europe and America, devolves really on the\r\nCongress of the United States. If we act here with prudence, wisdom, and\r\nfirmness, we shall not only successfully remonetize silver and bring it\r\ninto general use as money in our own country, but the influence of our\r\nexample will be potential among all European nations, with the possible\r\nexception of England. Indeed, our annual indebtment to Europe is so\r\ngreat that if we have the right to pay it in silver we necessarily\r\ncoerce those nations by the strongest of all forces, self-interest, to\r\naid us in up-holding the value of silver as money. But if we attempt the\r\nremonetization on a basis which is obviously and notoriously below\r\nthe fair standard of value as it now exists, we incur all the evil\r\nconsequences of failure at home and the positive certainty of successful\r\nopposition abroad. We are and shall be the greatest producers of silver\r\nin the world, and we have a larger stake in its complete monetization\r\nthan any other country. The difference to the United States between the\r\ngeneral acceptance of silver as money in the commercial world and its\r\ndestruction as money, will possibly equal within the next half-century\r\nthe entire bonded debt of the nation. But to gain this advantage we must\r\nmake it actual money--the accepted equal of gold in the markets of the\r\nworld. Re-monetization here followed by general remonetization in Europe\r\nwill secure to the United States the most stable basis for its currency\r\nthat we have ever enjoyed, and will effectually aid in solving all the\r\nproblems by which our financial situation is surrounded.\r\n\r\nSixth. On the much-vexed and long-mooted question of a bi-metallic or\r\nmono-metallic standard my own views are sufficiently indicated in the\r\nremarks I have made. I believe the struggle now going on in this country\r\nand in other countries for a single gold standard would, if successful,\r\nproduce wide-spread disaster in the end throughout the commercial world.\r\nThe destruction of silver as money and establishing gold as the sole\r\nunit of value must have a ruinous effect on all forms of property except\r\nthose investments which yield a fixed return in money. These would be\r\nenormously enhanced in value, and would gain a disproportionate and\r\nunfair advantage over every other species of property. If, as the most\r\nreliable statistics affirm, there are nearly seven thousand millions of\r\ncoin or bullion in the world, not very unequally divided between gold\r\nand silver, it is impossible to strike silver out of existence as money\r\nwithout results which will prove distressing to millions and utterly\r\ndisastrous to tens of thousands. Alexander Hamilton, in his able and\r\ninvaluable report in 1791 on the establishment of a mint, declared that\r\n\"to annul the use of either gold or silver as money is to abridge the\r\nquantity of circulating medium, and is liable to all the objections\r\nwhich arise from a comparison of the benefits of a full circulation with\r\nthe evils of a scanty circulation.\" I take no risk in saying that the\r\nbenefits of a full circulation and the evils of a scanty circulation\r\nare both immeasurably greater to-day than they were when Mr. Hamilton\r\nuttered these weighty words, always provided that the circulation is one\r\nof actual money, and not of depreciated promises to pay.\r\n\r\nIn the report from which I have already quoted, Mr. Hamilton argues at\r\nlength in favor of a double standard, and all the subsequent experience\r\nof well-nigh ninety years has brought out no clearer statement of the\r\nwhole case nor developed a more complete comprehension of this subtle\r\nand difficult subject. \"On the whole,\" says Mr. Hamilton, \"it seems most\r\nadvisable not to attach the unit exclusively to either of the metals,\r\nbecause this cannot be done effectually without destroying the office\r\nand character of one of them as money and reducing it to the situation\r\nof mere merchandise.\" And then Mr. Hamilton wisely concludes that this\r\nreduction of either of the metals to mere merchandise (I again quote\r\nhis exact words) \"would probably be a greater evil than occasional\r\nvariations in the unit from the fluctuations in the relative value\r\nof the metals, especially if care be taken to regulate the proportion\r\nbetween them with an eye to their average commercial value.\" I do not\r\nthink that this country, holding so vast a proportion of the world's\r\nsupply of silver in its mountains and its mines, can afford to reduce\r\nthe metal to the \"situation of mere merchandise.\" If silver ceases to\r\nbe used as money in Europe and America, the great mines of the Pacific\r\nslope will be closed and dead. Mining enterprises of the gigantic scale\r\nexisting in this country cannot be carried on to provide backs for\r\nlooking-glasses and to manufacture cream-pitchers and sugar-bowls. A\r\nvast source of wealth to this entire country is destroyed the moment\r\nsilver is permanently disused as money. It is for us to check that\r\ntendency and bring the continent of Europe back to the full recognition\r\nof the value of the metal as a medium of exchange.\r\n\r\nSeventh. The question of beginning anew the coinage of silver dollars\r\nhas aroused much discussion as to its effect on the public credit; and\r\nthe Senator from Ohio (Mr. Matthews) placed this phase of the subject\r\nin the very forefront of the debate--insisting, prematurely and\r\nillogically, I think, on a sort of judicial construction in advance, by\r\nconcurrent resolution, of a certain law in case that law should happen\r\nto be passed by Congress. My own view on this question can be stated\r\nvery briefly. I believe the public creditor can afford to be paid in any\r\nsilver dollar that the United States can afford to coin and circulate.\r\nWe have forty thousand millions of property in this country, and a wise\r\nself-interest will not permit us to overturn its relations by seeking\r\nfor an inferior dollar wherewith to settle the dues and demands of\r\nany creditor. The question might be different from a merely selfish\r\nstand-point if, on paying the dollar to the public creditor, it would\r\ndisappear after performing that function. But the trouble is that the\r\ninferior dollar you pay the public creditor remains in circulation, to\r\nthe exclusion of the better dollar. That which you pay at home will stay\r\nthere; that which you send abroad will come back. The interest of the\r\npublic creditor is indissolubly bound up with the interest of the whole\r\npeople. Whatever affects him affects us all; and the evil that we might\r\ninflict upon him by paying an inferior dollar would recoil upon us\r\nwith a vengeance as manifold as the aggregate wealth of the Republic\r\ntranscends the comparatively small limits of our bonded debt. And\r\nremember that our aggregate wealth is always increasing, and our\r\nbonded debt steadily growing less! If paid in a good silver dollar, the\r\nbondholder has nothing to complain of. If paid in an inferior silver\r\ndollar, he has the same grievance that will be uttered still more\r\nplaintively by the holder of the legal-tender note and of the\r\nnational-bank bill, by the pensioner, by the day-laborer, and by the\r\ncountless host of the poor, whom we have with us always, and on whom\r\nthe most distressing effect of inferior money will be ultimately\r\nprecipitated.\r\n\r\nBut I must say, Mr. President, that the specific demand for the payment\r\nof our bonds in gold coin and in nothing else, comes with an ill grace\r\nfrom certain quarters. European criticism is levelled against us and\r\nhard names are hurled at us across the ocean, for simply daring to state\r\nthat the letter of our law declares the bonds to be payable in standard\r\ncoin of July 14, 1870; expressly and explicitly declared so, and\r\ndeclared so in the interest of the public creditor, and the declaration\r\ninserted in the very body of the eight hundred million of bonds that\r\nhave been issued since that date. Beyond all doubt the silver dollar was\r\nincluded in the standard coins of that public act. Payment at that time\r\nwould have been as acceptable and as undisputed in silver as in gold\r\ndollars, for both were equally valuable in the European as well as in\r\nthe American market. Seven-eighths of all our bonds, owned out of the\r\ncountry, are held in Germany and in Holland, and Germany has demonetized\r\nsilver and Holland has been forced thereby to suspend its coinage, since\r\nthe subjects of both powers purchased our securities. The German Empire,\r\nthe very year after we made our specific declaration for paying our\r\nbonds in coin, passed a law destroying so far as lay in their power the\r\nvalue of silver as money. I do not say that it was specially aimed at\r\nthis country, but it was passed regardless of its effect upon us, and\r\nwas followed, according to public and undenied statement, by a large\r\ninvestment on the part of the German Government in our bonds, with a\r\nview, it was understood, of holding them as a coin reserve for drawing\r\ngold from us to aid in establishing their gold standard at home. Thus,\r\nby one move the German Government destroyed, so far as lay in its power,\r\nthe then existing value of silver as money, enhanced consequently the\r\nvalue of gold, and then got into position to draw gold from us at the\r\nmoment of their need, which would also be the moment of our own sorest\r\ndistress. I do not say that the German Government in these successive\r\nsteps did a single thing which it had not a perfect right to do, but I\r\ndo say that the subjects of that Empire have no right to complain of our\r\nGovernment for the initial step which has impaired the value of one of\r\nour standard coins. And the German Government by joining with us in\r\nthe remonetization of silver, can place that standard coin in its\r\nold position and make it as easy for this Government to pay and as\r\nprofitable for their subjects to receive the one metal as the other.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe effect of paying the labor of this country in silver coin of full\r\nvalue, as compared with the irredeemable paper or as compared even with\r\nsilver of inferior value, will make itself felt in a single generation\r\nto the extent of tens of millions, perhaps hundreds of millions, in\r\nthe aggregate savings which represent consolidated capital. It is the\r\ninstinct of man from the savage to the scholar--developed in childhood\r\nand remaining with age--to value the metals which in all tongues are\r\ncalled precious. Excessive paper money leads to extravagance, to waste,\r\nand to want, as we painfully witness on all sides to-day. And in the\r\nmidst of the proof of its demoralizing and destructive effect, we hear\r\nit proclaimed in the Halls of Congress that \"the people demand\r\ncheap money.\" I deny it. I declare such a phrase to be a total\r\nmisapprehension, a total misinterpretation of the popular wish. The\r\npeople do not demand cheap money. They demand an abundance of good\r\nmoney, which is an entirely different thing. They do not want a single\r\ngold standard that will exclude silver and benefit those already rich.\r\nThey do not want an inferior silver standard that will drive out gold\r\nand not help those already poor. They want both metals, in full value,\r\nin equal honor, in what-ever abundance the bountiful earth will yield\r\nthem to the searching eye of science and to the hard hand of labor.\r\n\r\nThe two metals have existed side by side in harmonious, honorable\r\ncompanionship as money, ever since intelligent trade was known among\r\nmen. It is well-nigh forty centuries since \"Abraham weighed to Ephron\r\nthe silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth--four\r\nhundred shekels of silver--current money with the merchant.\" Since that\r\ntime nations have risen and fallen, races have disappeared, dialects\r\nand languages have been forgotten, arts have been lost, treasures have\r\nperished, continents have been discovered, islands have been sunk in the\r\nsea, and through all these ages and through all these changes, silver\r\nand gold have reigned supreme, as the representatives of value, as the\r\nmedia of exchange. The dethronement of each has been attempted in turn,\r\nand sometimes the dethronement of both; but always in vain. And we are\r\nhere to-day, deliberating anew over the problem which comes down to us\r\nfrom Abraham's time: the weight of the silver that shall be \"current\r\nmoney with the merchant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN SHERMAN,\r\n\r\nOF OHIO. (BORN 1823.)\r\n\r\nON SILVER COINAGE AND TREASURY NOTES;\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATE, JUNE 5, 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\nI approach the discussion of this bill and the kindred bills and\r\namendments pending in the two Houses with unaffected diffidence. No\r\nproblem is submitted to us of equal importance and difficulty. Our\r\naction will affect the value of all the property of the people of the\r\nUnited States, and the wages of labor of every kind, and our trade and\r\ncommerce with all the world. In the consideration of such a question\r\nwe should not be controlled by previous opinions or bound by local\r\ninterests, but with the lights of experience and full knowledge of all\r\nthe complicated facts involved, give to the subject the best judgment\r\nwhich imperfect human nature allows. With the wide diversity of opinion\r\nthat prevails, each of us must make concessions in order to secure such\r\na measure as will accomplish the objects sought for without impairing\r\nthe public credit or the general interests of our people. This is no\r\ntime for visionary theories of political economy. We must deal with\r\nfacts as we find them and not as we wish them. We must aim at results\r\nbased upon practical experience, for what has been probably will be. The\r\nbest prophet of the future is the past.\r\n\r\nTo know what measures ought to be adopted we should have a clear\r\nconception of what we wish to accomplish. I believe a majority of\r\nthe Senate desire, first, to provide an increase of money to meet the\r\nincreasing wants of our rapidly growing country and population, and\r\nto supply the reduction in our circulation caused by the retiring of\r\nnational-bank notes; second, to increase the market value of silver not\r\nonly in the United States but in the world, in the belief that this is\r\nessential to the success of any measure proposed, and in the hope that\r\nour efforts will advance silver to its legal ratio with gold, and induce\r\nthe great commercial nations to join with us in maintaining the legal\r\nparity of the two metals, or in agreeing with us in a new ratio of their\r\nrelative value; and third, to secure a genuine bimetallic standard, one\r\nthat will not demonetize gold or cause it to be hoarded or exported, but\r\nthat will establish both gold and silver as standards of value not only\r\nin the United States, but among all the civilized nations of the world.\r\n\r\nBelieving that these are the chief objects aimed at by us all, and that\r\nwe differ only as to the best means to obtain them, I will discuss\r\nthe pending propositions to test how far they tend, in my opinion, to\r\npromote or defeat these obtects.\r\n\r\nAnd, first, as to the amount of currency necessary to meet the wants of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that there has been a constant increase of currency. It is\r\na fact which must be constantly borne in mind. If any evils now exist\r\nsuch as have been so often stated, such as falling prices, increased\r\nmortgages, contentions between capital and labor, decreasing value of\r\nsilver, increased relative value of gold, they must be attributed to\r\nsome other cause than our insufficient supply of circulation, for not\r\nonly has the circulation increased in these twelve years 80 per cent.,\r\nwhile our population has only increased 36 per cent., but it has all\r\nbeen maintained at the gold standard, which, it is plain, has been\r\ngreatly advanced in purchasing power. If the value of money is tested by\r\nits amount, by numerals, according to the favorite theory of the Senator\r\nfrom Nevada (Mr. Jones), then surely we ought to be on the high road\r\nof prosperity, for these numerals have increased in twelve years from\r\n$805,000,-000 to $1,405,000,000 in October last, and to $1,420,000,000\r\non the 1st of this month. This single fact disposes of the claim that\r\ninsufficient currency is the cause of the woes, real and imaginary, that\r\nhave been depicted, and compel us to look to other causes for the evils\r\ncomplained of.\r\n\r\nI admit that prices for agricultural productions have been abnormally\r\nlow, and that the farmers of the United States have suffered greatly\r\nfrom this cause. But this depression of prices is easily accounted\r\nfor by the greatly increased amount of agricultural production, the\r\nwonderful development of agricultural implements, the opening of vast\r\nregions of new and fertile fields in the West, the reduced cost\r\nof transportation, the doubling of the miles of railroads, and the\r\nquadrupling capacity of railroads and steamboats for transportation, and\r\nthe new-fangled forms of trusts and combinations which monopolize nearly\r\nall the productions of the farms and workshops of our country, reducing\r\nthe price to the producer and in some cases increasing the cost to the\r\nconsumer. All these causes cooperate to reduce prices of farm products.\r\nNo one of them can be traced to an insufficient currency, now larger in\r\namount in proportion to population than ever before in our history.\r\n\r\nBut to these causes of a domestic character must be added others, over\r\nwhich we have no control. The same wonderful development of industry\r\nhas been going on in other parts of the globe. In Russia, especially in\r\nSouthern Russia, vast regions have been opened to the commerce of the\r\nworld. Railroads have been built, mines have been opened, exhaustless\r\nsupplies of petroleum have been found, and all these are competitors\r\nwith us in supplying the wants of Europe for food, metals, heat, and\r\nlight. India, with its teeming millions of poorly paid laborers, is\r\ncompeting with our farmers, and their products are transported to market\r\nover thousands of miles of railroads constructed by English capital,\r\nor by swift steamers through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, reaching\r\ndirectly the people of Europe whom we formerly supplied with food. No\r\nwonder, then, that our agriculture is depressed by low prices, caused by\r\ncompetition with new rivals and agencies.\r\n\r\nAny one who can overlook these causes and attribute low prices to a want\r\nof domestic currency, that has increased and is increasing continually,\r\nmust be blind to the great forces that in recent times throughout the\r\nworld are tending by improved methods and modern inventions to lessen\r\nthe prices of all commodities.\r\n\r\nThese fluctuations depend upon the law of supply and demand, involving\r\nfacts too numerous to state, but rarely depending on the volume of money\r\nin circulation. An increase of currency can have no effect to advance\r\nprices unless we cheapen and degrade it by making it less valuable; and\r\nif that is the intention now, the direct and honest way is to put\r\nfewer grains of gold or silver in our dollar. This was the old way, by\r\nclipping the coin, adding base metal.\r\n\r\nIf we want a cheaper dollar we have the clear constitutional right to put\r\nin it 15 grains of gold instead of 23, or 300 grains of silver instead\r\nof 412 1/2, but you have no power to say how many bushels of wheat the\r\nnew dollar shall buy. You can, if you choose, cheapen the dollar under\r\nyour power to coin money, and thus enable a debtor to pay his debts with\r\nfewer grains of silver or gold, under the pretext that gold or silver\r\nhas risen in value, but in this way you would destroy all forms of\r\ncredit and make it impossible for nations or individuals to borrow money\r\nfor a period of time. It is a species of repudiation.\r\n\r\nThe best standard of value is one that measures for the longest period\r\nits equivalent in other products. Its relative value may vary from time\r\nto time. If it falls, the creditor loses; if it increases, the debtor\r\nloses; and these changes are the chances of all trade and commerce and\r\nall loaning and borrowing. The duty of the Government is performed when\r\nit coins money and provides convenient credit representatives of\r\ncoin. The purchasing power of money for other commodities depends upon\r\nchanging conditions over which the Government has no control. Even its\r\npower to issue paper money has been denied until recently, but this may\r\nbe considered as settled by the recent decisions of the Supreme Court\r\nin the legal-tender cases. All that Congress ought to do is to provide\r\na sufficient amount of money, either of coin or its equivalent of paper\r\nmoney, to meet the current wants of business. This it has done in the\r\ntwelve years last passed at a ratio of increase far in excess of any in\r\nour previous history.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nUnder the law of February, 1878, the purchase of $2,000,000 worth of\r\nsilver bullion a month has by coinage produced annually an average of\r\nnearly $3,000,000 a month for a period of twelve years, but this amount,\r\nin view of the retirement of the bank notes, will not increase our\r\ncurrency in proportion to our increase in population. If our present\r\ncurrency is estimated at $1,400,000,000, and our population is\r\nincreasing at the ratio of 3 per cent. per annum, it would require\r\n$42,000,000 increased circulation each year to keep pace with the\r\nincrease of population; but as the increase of population is accompanied\r\nby a still greater ratio of increase of wealth and business, it was\r\nthought that an immediate increase of circulation might be obtained by\r\nlarger pur chases of silver bullion to an amount sufficient to make\r\ngood the retirement of bank notes, and keep pace with the growth of\r\npopulation. Assuming that $54,000,000 a year of additional circulation\r\nis needed upon this basis, that amount is provided for in this bill by\r\nthe issue of Treasury notes in exchange for bullion at the market price.\r\nI see no objection to this proposition, but believe that Treasury\r\nnotes based upon silver bullion purchased in this way will be as safe a\r\nfoundation for paper money as can be conceived.\r\n\r\nExperience shows that silver coin will not circulate to any considerable\r\namount. Only about one silver dollar to each inhabitant is maintained\r\nin circulation with all the efforts made by the Treasury Department,\r\nbut silver certificates, the representatives of this coin, pass current\r\nwithout question, and are maintained at par in gold by being received\r\nby the Government for all purposes and redeemed if called for. I do not\r\nfear to give to these notes every sanction and value that the United\r\nStates can confer. I do not object to their being made a legal tender\r\nfor all debts, public or private. I believe that if they are to be\r\nissued they ought to be issued as money, with all the sanction and\r\nauthority that the Government can possibly confer. While I believe the\r\namount to be issued is greater than is necessary, yet in view of the\r\nretirement of bank notes I yielded my objections to the increase beyond\r\n$4,000,000. As an expedient to provide increased circulation it is far\r\npreferable to free coinage of silver or any proposition that has been\r\nmade to provide some other security than United States bonds for bank\r\ncirculation. I believe it will accomplish the first object proposed, a\r\ngradual and steady increase of the current money of the country.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWhat then can we do to arrest the fall of silver and to advance its\r\nmarket value? I know of but two expedients. One is to purchase bullion\r\nin large quantities as the basis and security of Treasury notes, as\r\nproposed by this bill. The other is to adopt the single standard of\r\nsilver, and take the chances for its rise or fall in the markets of the\r\nworld. I have already stated the probable results of the hoarding of\r\nbullion. By purchasing in the open market our domestic production of\r\nsilver and hoarding it in the Treasury we withdraw so much from the\r\nsupply of the world, and thus maintain or increase the price of the\r\nremaining silver production of the world. It is not idle in our vaults,\r\nbut is represented by certificates in active circulation. Sixteen ounces\r\nof silver bullion may not be worth one ounce of gold, still one dollar's\r\nworth of silver bullion is worth one dollar of gold.\r\n\r\nWhat will be the effect of the free coinage of silver? It is said that\r\nit will at once advance silver to par with gold at the ratio of 16 to\r\n1. I deny it. The attempt will bring us to the single standard of the\r\ncheaper metal. When we advertise that we will buy all the silver of the\r\nworld at that ratio and pay in Treasury notes, our notes will have the\r\nprecise value of 371 1/2 grains of pure silver, but the silver will have\r\nno higher value in the markets of the world. If, now, that amount of\r\nsilver can be purchased at 80 cents, then gold will be worth $1.25 in\r\nthe new standard. All labor, property, and commodities will advance in\r\nnominal value, but their purchasing power in other commodities will not\r\nincrease. If you make the yard 30 inches long instead of 36 you must\r\npurchase more yards for a coat or a dress, but do not lessen the cost\r\nof the coat or the dress. You may by free coinage, by a species of\r\nconfiscation, reduce the burden of a debt, but you cannot change the\r\nrelative value of gold or silver, or any object of human desire. The\r\nonly result is to demonetize gold and to cause it to be hoarded or\r\nexported. The cheaper metal fills the channels of circulation and the\r\ndearer metal commands a premium.\r\n\r\nIf experience is needed to prove so plain an axiom we have it in our own\r\nhistory. At the beginning of our National Government we fixed the value\r\nof gold and silver as 1 to 15. Gold was undervalued and fled the country\r\nto where an ounce of gold was worth 151 ounces of silver. Congress, in\r\n1834, endeavored to rectify this by making the ratio 1 to 16, but by\r\nthis silver was undervalued. Sixteen ounces of silver were worth more\r\nthan 1 ounce of gold, and silver disappeared. Congress, in 1853, adopted\r\nanother expedient to secure the value of both metals as money. By\r\nthis expedient gold is the standard and silver the subsidiary coin,\r\ncontaining confessedly silver of less value in the market than the gold\r\ncoin, but maintained at the parity of gold coin by the Government.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nBut it is said that those of us who demand the gold standard, or\r\npaper money always equal to gold, are the representatives of capital,\r\nmoney-changers, bondholders, Shylocks, who want to grind and oppress the\r\npeople. This kind of argument I hoped would never find its way into the\r\nSenate Chamber. It is the cry of the demagogue, without the slightest\r\nfoundation. All these classes can take care of themselves. They are the\r\nmen who make their profits out of the depreciation of money. They can\r\nmark up the price of their property to meet changing standards. They can\r\nprotect themselves by gold contracts. In proportion to their wealth\r\nthey have less money on hand than any other class. They have already\r\nprotected themselves to a great extent by converting the great body of\r\nthe securities in which they deal into gold bonds, and they hold the\r\ngold of the country, which you cannot change in value. They are not, as\r\na rule, the creditors of the country.\r\n\r\nThe great creditors are savings-banks, insurance companies, widows and\r\norphans, and provident farmers, and business men on a small scale. The\r\ngreat operators are the great borrowers and owe more than is due them.\r\nTheir credit is their capital and they need not have even money enough\r\nto pay their rent.\r\n\r\nBut how will this change affect the great mass of our fellow-citizens\r\nwho depend upon their daily labor? A dollar to them means so much food,\r\nclothing, and rent. If you cheapen the dollar it will buy less of\r\nthese. You may say they will get more dollars for their labor, but all\r\nexperience shows that labor and land are the last to feel the change in\r\nmonetary standards, and the same resistance will be made to an advance\r\nof wages on the silver standard as on the gold standard, and when the\r\nadvance is won it will be found that the purchasing power of the new\r\ndollar is less than the old. No principle of political economy is better\r\nestablished than that the producing classes are the first to suffer and\r\nthe last to gain by monetary changes.\r\n\r\nI might apply this argument to the farmer, the merchant, the\r\nprofessional man, and to all classes except the speculator or the\r\ndebtor who wishes to lessen the burden of his obligations; but it is not\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said that all this is a false alarm, that our demand\r\nfor silver will absorb all that will be offered and bring it to par with\r\ngold at the old ratio. I have no faith in such a miracle. If they really\r\nthought so, many would lose their interest in the question. What they\r\nwant is a cheaper dollar that would pay debts easier. Others do not\r\nwant either silver or gold, but want numbers, numerals, the fruit of\r\nthe printing-press, to be fixed every year by Congress as we do an\r\nappropriation bill.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, I am willing to do all I can with safety even to taking great\r\nrisks to increase the value of silver to gold at the old ratio, and\r\nto supply paper substitutes for both for circulation, but there is\r\none immutable, unchangeable, ever-existing condition, that the paper\r\nsubstitute must always have the same purchasing power as gold and\r\nsilver coin, maintained at their legal ratio with each other. I feel a\r\nconviction, as strong as the human mind can have, that the free coinage\r\nof silver now by the United States will be a grave mistake and a\r\nmisfortune to all classes and conditions of our fellow-citizens. I\r\nalso have a hope and belief, but far from a certainty, that the measure\r\nproposed for the purchase of silver bullion to a limited amount, and the\r\nissue of Treasury notes for it, will bring silver and gold to the old\r\nratio, and will lead to an agreement with other commercial nations to\r\nmaintain the free coinage of both metals.\r\n\r\nAnd now, sir, I want to state in conclusion, without any purpose to\r\nbind myself to detail, that I will vote for any measure that will, in\r\nmy judgment, secure a genuine bimetallic standard--one that will\r\nnot demonetize gold or cause it to be hoarded or exported, but will\r\nestablish both silver and gold as common standards and maintain them at\r\na fixed ratio, not only in the United States but among all the nations\r\nof the world. The principles adopted by the Acts of 1853 and 1875 have\r\nbeen sustained by experience and should be adhered to. In pursuance of\r\nthem I would receive into the Treasury of the United States all the\r\ngold and silver produced in our country at their market value, not at\r\na speculative or forced value, but at their value in the markets of the\r\nworld. And for the convenience of our people I would represent them by\r\nTreasury notes to an amount not exceeding their cost. I would confer\r\nupon these notes all the use, qualities, and attributes that we can\r\nconfer within our constitutional power, and support and maintain them\r\nas money by coining the silver and gold as needed upon the present legal\r\nratios, and by a pledge of all the revenues of the Government and all\r\nthe wealth and credit of the United States.\r\n\r\nAnd I would proclaim to all our readiness, by international negotiations\r\nor treaties, to bring about an agreement among nations for common units\r\nof value and of weights and measures for all the productions of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThis hope of philosophers and statesmen is now nearer realization than\r\never before. If we could contribute to this result it would tend to\r\npromote commerce and intercourse, trade and travel, peace and harmony\r\namong nations. It would be in line with the civilization of our age.\r\nIt is by such measures statesmen may keep pace with the marvellous\r\ninventions, improvements, and discoveries which have quadrupled the\r\ncapacity of man for production, made lightning subservient to his will,\r\nrevealed to him new agencies of power hidden in the earth, and opened\r\nup to his enterprise all the dark places of the world. The people of\r\nthe United States boast that they have done their full share in all this\r\ndevelopment; that they have grown in population, wealth, and strength;\r\nthat they are the richest of nations, with untarnished credit, a model\r\nand example of self-government without kings or princes or lords. Surely\r\nthis is no time for a radical change of public policy which seems to\r\nhave no motive except to reduce the burden of obligations freely taken,\r\na change likely to impair our public credit and produce disorder and\r\nconfusion in all monetary transactions. Others may see reasons for this\r\nchange, but I prefer to stand by the standards of value that come to us\r\nwith the approval and sanction of every party that has administered the\r\nGovernment since its beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN P. JONES,\r\n\r\nOF NEVADA. (BORN 1830.)\r\n\r\nON TREASURY NOTES AND SILVER,\r\n\r\nIN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES, MAY 12, 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT, the question now about to be discussed by this body is\r\nin my judgment the most important that has attracted the attention of\r\nCongress or the country since the formation of the Constitution. It\r\naffects every interest, great and small, from the slightest concern of\r\nthe individual to the largest and most comprehensive interest of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThe measure under consideration was reported by me from the Committee on\r\nFinance. It is hardly necessary for me to say, however, that it does not\r\nfully reflect my individual views regarding the relation which silver\r\nshould bear to the monetary circulation of the country or of the world.\r\nI am, at all times and in all places, a firm and unwavering advocate of\r\nthe free and unlimited coinage of silver, not merely for the reason that\r\nsilver is as ancient and honorable a money metal as gold, and equally\r\nwell adapted for the money use, but for the further reason that, looking\r\nat the annual yield from the mines, the entire supply that can come to\r\nthe mints will at no time be more than is needed to maintain at a\r\nsteady level the prices of commodities among a constantly increasing\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nHistory gives evidence of no more prolific source of human misery than a\r\npersistent and long continued fall in the general range of prices.\r\nBut, although exercising so pernicious an influence, it is not itself a\r\ncause, but an effect.\r\n\r\nWhen a fall of prices is found operating, not on one article or class of\r\narticles alone, but on the products of all industries; when found to\r\nbe not confined to any one climate, country, or race of people, but to\r\ndiffuse itself over the civilized world; when it is found not to be a\r\ncharacteristic of any one year, but to go on progressively for a series\r\nof years, it becomes manifest that it does not and can not arise from\r\nlocal, temporary, or subordinate causes, but must have its genesis and\r\ndevelopment in some principle of universal application.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is it that produces a general decline of prices in any\r\ncountry? It is produced by a shrinkage in the volume of money relatively\r\nto population and business, which has never yet failed to cause an\r\nincrease in the value of the money unit, and a consequent decrease in\r\nthe price of the commodities for which such unit is exchanged. If the\r\nvolume of money in circulation be made to bear a direct and steady ratio\r\nto population and business, prices will be maintained at a steady level,\r\nand, what is of supreme importance, money will be kept of unchanging\r\nvalue. With an advancing civilization, in which a large volume of\r\nbusiness is conducted on a basis of credit extending over long periods,\r\nit is of the uttermost importance that money, which is the measure of\r\nall equities, should be kept unchanging in value through time.\r\n\r\nA reduction in the volume of money relatively to population and\r\nbusiness, or, (to state the proposition in another form) a volume which\r\nremains stationary while population and business are increasing, has the\r\neffect of increasing the value of each unit of money, by increasing its\r\npurchasing power.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWe have 22,000,000 workmen in this country. In order that they may be\r\nkept uninterruptedly employed it is absolutely necessary that business\r\ncontracts and obligations be made long in advance. Accordingly, we read\r\nalmost daily of the inception of industrial undertakings requiring years\r\nto fulfil. It is not too much to say that the suspension for one season\r\nof the making of time-contracts would close the factories, furnaces, and\r\nmachine-shops of all civilized countries.\r\n\r\nThe natural concomitant of such a system of industry is the elaborate\r\nsystem of debt and credit which has grown up with it, and is\r\nindispensable to it. Any serious enhancement in the value of the unit of\r\nmoney between the time of making a contract or incurring a debt and the\r\ndate of fulfilment or maturity always works hardship and frequently ruin\r\nto the contractor or debtor.\r\n\r\nThree fourths of the business enterprises of this country are conducted\r\non borrowed capital. Three fourths of the homes and farms that stand in\r\nthe name of the actual occupants have been bought on time, and a very\r\nlarge proportion of them are mortgaged for the payment of some part of\r\nthe purchase money.\r\n\r\nUnder the operation of a shrinkage in the volume of money this enormous\r\nmass of borrowers, at the maturity of their respective debts, though\r\nnominally paying no more than the amount borrowed, with interest, are,\r\nin reality, in the amount of the principal alone, returning a percentage\r\nof value greater than they received--more than in equity they contracted\r\nto pay, and oftentimes more, in substance, than they profited by the\r\nloan. To the man of business this percentage in many cases constitutes\r\nthe difference between success and failure. Thus a shrinkage in the\r\nvolume of money is the prolific source of bankruptcy and ruin. It is the\r\ncanker that, unperceived and unsuspected, is eating out the prosperity\r\nof our people. By reason of the almost universal inattention to the\r\nnature and functions of money this evil is permitted, unobserved, to\r\nwork widespread ruin and disaster. So subtle is it in its operations\r\nthat it eludes the vigilance of the most acute. It baffles all foresight\r\nand calculation; it sets at naught all industry, all energy, all\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe advocates of the single gold standard deem even silver money much\r\nbetter money than greenbacks. Does it then follow that when greenbacks\r\nwere our only money--good enough money to carry our nation through the\r\ngreatest war in all history--we were \"along-side\" or underneath the\r\nbarbarous nations of the world? It is not the form or material of a\r\nnation's money that fixes its status relatively to other nations. That\r\nis accomplished by the vitality, the energy, the intellectuality and\r\neffective force of its people. The United States can never be placed\r\n\"alongside\" any barbarous nation, except by compelling our people to\r\ncompete with barbarous peoples--compelling them to sell the products of\r\nAmerican labor at prices regulated by the cost of labor and manner of\r\nliving in barbarous countries. As well might it be said that we are\r\nalongside the barbarous people of India because we continue to produce\r\nwheat and cotton.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing feature of all barbarous nations is the squalor of\r\ntheir working classes. The reward of their hard toil is barely enough\r\nto maintain animal existence. A civilized people are placed alongside\r\na barbarous one when, in their means of livelihood, the foundation of\r\ntheir civilization, they are made to compete with the barbarians. That\r\nwas the result accomplished for the farmers and planters of the United\r\nStates when silver was demonetized.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable circumstance, Mr. President, that throughout the\r\nentire range of economic discussion in gold-standard circles, it seems\r\nto be taken for granted that a change in the value of the money unit is\r\na matter of no significance, and imports no mischief to society, so long\r\nas the change is in one direction. Who has ever heard from an Eastern\r\njournal any complaint against a contraction of our money volume; any\r\nadmonition that in a shrinking volume of money lurk evils of the utmost\r\nmagnitude? On the other hand, we have been treated to lengthy homilies\r\non the evils of \"inflation,\" whenever the slightest prospect presented\r\nitself to a decrease in the value of money--not with the view of giving\r\nthe debtor an advantage over the lender of money, but of preventing the\r\nunconscionable injustice of a further increasing value in the dollars\r\nwhich the debtor contracted to pay. Loud and re-sounding protests have\r\nbeen entered against the \"dishonesty\" of making payments in \"depreciated\r\ndollars.\" The debtors are characterized as dishonest for desiring to\r\nkeep money at a steady and unwavering value. If that object could be\r\nsecured, it would undoubtedly be to the interest of the debtor, and\r\ncould not possibly work any injustice to the creditor. It would simply\r\nassure to both debtor and creditor the exact measure for which they\r\nbargained. It would enable the debtor to pay his debt with exactly the\r\namount of sacrifice to which, on the making of the debt, he undertook to\r\nsubmit, in order to pay it.\r\n\r\nIn all discussions of the subject the creditors attempt to brush aside\r\nthe equities involved by sneering at the debtors. But, Mr. President,\r\ndebt is the distinguishing characteristic of modern society. It is\r\nthrough debt that the marvellous developments of the nineteenth-century\r\ncivilization have been effected. Who are the debtors in this country?\r\nWho are the borrowers of money? The men of enterprise, of energy, of\r\nskill, the men of industry, of fore-sight, of calculation, of daring.\r\nIn the ranks of the debtors will be found a large preponderance of the\r\nconstructive energy of every country. The debtors are the upbuilders of\r\nthe national wealth and prosperity; they are the men of initiative, the\r\nmen who conceive plans and set on foot enterprises. They are those who\r\nby borrowing money enrich the community. They are the dynamic force\r\namong the people. They are the busy, restless, moving throng whom you\r\nfind in all walks of life in this country--the active, the vigorous, the\r\nstrong, the undaunted.\r\n\r\nThese men are sustained in their efforts by the hope and belief that\r\ntheir labors will be crowned with success. Destroy that hope and you\r\ntake away from society the most powerful of all the incentives to\r\nmaterial development; you place in the pathway of progress an obstacle\r\nwhich it is impossible to surmount.\r\n\r\nThe men of whom I have spoken are undoubtedly the first who are likely\r\nto be affected by a shrinkage in the volume of money.\r\n\r\nThe highest prosperity of a nation is attained only when all its people\r\nare employed in avocations suited to their individual aptitudes, and\r\nwhen a just money system insures an equitable distribution of the\r\nproducts of their industry. With our present complex civilization, in\r\norder that men may have constant employment, it is indispensable that\r\nwork be planned and undertakings projected years in advance. Without\r\nan intelligent forecast of enterprises large numbers of workmen must\r\nperiodically be relegated to idleness. Enterprises that take years to\r\ncomplete must be contracted for in advance, and payments provided for.\r\n\r\nA constant but unperceived rise in the value of the dollar with which\r\nthose payments must be made, baffles all plans, thwarts all calculation,\r\nand destroys all equities between debtor and creditor. If we cannot\r\nintelligently regulate our money volume so as to maintain unchanging\r\nthe value of the money unit, if we cannot preserve our people from the\r\nblighting effects which an increase in the measuring power of the\r\nmoney unit entails upon all industry, to what purpose is our boasted\r\ncivilization?\r\n\r\nBy the increase of that measuring power all hopes are disappointed, all\r\npurposes baffled, all efforts thwarted, all calculations defied. This\r\nsubtle enlargement in the measuring power of the unit of money (the\r\ndollar) affects every class of the working community. Like a poisonous\r\ndrug in the human body, it permeates every vein, every artery, every\r\nfibre and filament of the industrial structure. The debtor is fighting\r\nfor his life against an enemy he does not see, against an influence\r\nhe does not understand. For, while his calculations were well and\r\nintelligently made, and the amount of his debts and the terms of his\r\ncontracts remain the same, the weight of all his obligations has been\r\nincreased by an insidious increase in the value of the money unit.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIn an ancient village there once stood a gold clock, which, ever since\r\nthe invention of clocks, had been the measure of time for the people\r\nof that village. They were proud of its beauty, its workmanship, its\r\nmusical stroke, and the unfailing regularity with which it heralded the\r\npassing hours. This clock had been endeared to all the inhabitants of\r\nthe village by the hallowed associations with which it was identified.\r\nGeneration after generation it had called the children from far and wide\r\nto attend the village school; its fresh morning peal had set the honest\r\nvillagers to labor; its noonday notes had called them to refreshment;\r\nits welcome evening chime had summoned them to rest.\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial, on all festive occasions, it had rung out its\r\nmerry tones to assemble the young people on the green; and on the\r\nSabbath it had advertised to all the countryside the hour of worship in\r\nthe village church. So perfect was its mechanism that it never needed\r\nrepair. So proud were the people of this wonderful clock that it became\r\nthe standard for all the country round about, and the time which it kept\r\ncame to be known as the gold standard of time, which was universally\r\nadmitted to be correct and unchanging.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time there wandered that way a queer character,\r\na clock-maker, who being fully instructed in the inner workings of\r\ntime-tellers, and not having inherited the traditions of that village,\r\ndid not regard this clock with the veneration accorded to it by the\r\nnatives. To their astonishment he denied that there was really any\r\nsuch thing as a gold standard of time; and in order to prove that the\r\nmaterial, gold, did not monopolize all the qualities characteristic of\r\nclocks, he placed alongside the gold clock, another clock, of silver,\r\nand set both clocks at 12 noon. For a long time the clocks ran along\r\nin almost perfect accord, their only disagreement being that of an\r\noccasional second or two, and even that disagreement only at rare\r\nintervals, such as might naturally occur with the best of clocks. But\r\nthe Council of the village, in their admiration for the gold clock,\r\npassed an ordinance requiring that all the weights (the motive power) of\r\nthe silver clock, except one, be removed from it, and attached to those\r\nof the gold clock. Instantly the clocks began to fall apart, and one\r\nday, as the sun was passing the meridian, the hands of the gold clock\r\nwere observed to indicate the hour of 1, while those of the silver clock\r\nindicated 12.15. At this everybody in the village ridiculed the\r\nsilver clock, derided the silver standard, and hurled epithets at the\r\nindividual who had had the temerity to doubt the infallibility of the\r\ngold standard.\r\n\r\nFinally, the divergence between the clocks went so far that it was noon\r\nby the gold standard when it was only 6 A.M. by the silver standard, so\r\nthat those who were guided by the gold standard, notwithstanding that it\r\nwas yet the gray of the morning, insisted on eating their mid-day meal,\r\nbecause the gold standard indicated that it must be noon. And when\r\nthe sun was high in the heavens, and its light was shining warm and\r\nrefulgent on the dusty streets of the village, those who observed the\r\ngold standard had already eaten supper and were preparing for bed.\r\n\r\nBut this state of things could not last. It was clear that the\r\ndifference between the standards must be reconciled, or all industry\r\nwould be disarranged and the village ruined.\r\n\r\nDiscussion was rife among the villagers as to the cause of the\r\ndifference. Some said the silver clock had lost time; others that both\r\nclocks had lost time, but the silver clock more than the gold; while\r\nothers again asserted that both clocks had gained time, but that the\r\ngold clock had gained more than the silver clock.\r\n\r\nWhile this discussion was at its height a philosopher came along and\r\nobserving the excitement on the subject remarked: \"By measuring two\r\nthings, one against the other, you can never arrive at any determination\r\nas to which has changed. Instead of disputing as to whether one clock\r\nhas lost or another gained would it not be well to consult the sun and\r\nthe stars and ascertain exactly what has happened?\"\r\n\r\nSome demurred to this because, as they asserted, the gold standard was\r\nunchanging and was always right no matter how much it might seem to be\r\nwrong; others agreed that the philosopher's advice should be taken.\r\nUpon consulting the sun and the stars it was discovered that what had\r\nhappened was that both clocks had gained in time but that the gain of\r\nthe silver clock had been very slight, while that of the gold clock had\r\nbeen so great as to disturb all industry and destroy all correct sense\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nNothwithstanding this demonstration, there were many who adhered to the\r\nbelief that the gold standard was correct and unchanging, and insisted\r\nthat what appeared to be its aberrations were not in reality due to any\r\nfault of the gold clock, but to some convulsion of nature by which\r\nthe solar system had been disarranged and the planets made to move\r\nirregularly in their orbits.\r\n\r\nSome of the people also remembered having heard at the village inn, from\r\ntravellers returning from the East, that silver clocks were the standard\r\nof time in India and other barbarous countries, while in countries of a\r\nmore advanced civilization gold clocks were the standard. They therefore\r\nfeared that the use of the silver clock might have the effect of\r\ndegrading the civilization of the village by placing it alongside India\r\nand other barbarous countries. And although the great mass of the people\r\nreally believed, from the demonstration made, that the silver standard\r\nof time was the better one, yet this objection was so momentous that\r\nthey were puzzled what course to pursue, and at last advices were\r\nconsulting the manufacturers of gold clocks as to what was best to be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nNow our gold standard men are in the position of those who first refuse\r\nto look at anything beyond the two things, gold and silver, to see what\r\nhas happened, and who, when it is finally demonstrated that all other\r\nthings retain their former relations to silver, still persist that the\r\nlaw which makes gold an unchanging standard of measure is more immutable\r\nthan that which holds the stars in their courses. If they will compare\r\ngold and silver with commodities in general, to see how the metals have\r\nmaintained their relations, not to one another but to all other things,\r\nthey will find that instead of a fall having taken place in the value of\r\nsilver, the change that has really taken place is a rise in the value of\r\nboth gold and silver, the rise in silver being relatively slight, while\r\nthat of gold has been ruinously great. And those who do not shut their\r\neyes to the truth must see that the change of relation between the\r\nmetals has been effected by depriving silver of its legal-tender\r\nfunction, as the want of accord between the clocks was brought about\r\nby depriving the silver clock of a portion of its motive power--the\r\nweights. The only thing that has prevented a greater divergency between\r\nthe metals is the limited coinage by the United States--the single\r\nweight that, withheld from the gold clock, prevented its more ruinous\r\ngain.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nEverybody admits that the value of all other things is regulated by the\r\nplay against each other of the forces of supply and demand. No reason\r\nhas been or can be given why the value of the unit of money is not\r\nsubject to this law.\r\n\r\nThe demand for money is equivalent to the sum of the demands for all\r\nother things whatsoever, for it is through a demand first made on\r\nmoney that all the wants of man are satisfied. The demand for money is\r\ninstant, constant, and unceasing, and is always at a maximum. If any man\r\nwants a pair of shoes, or a suit of clothes, he does not make his demand\r\nfirst on the shoemaker, or clothier. No man, except a beggar, makes a\r\ndemand directly for food, clothes, or any other article. Whether it be\r\nto obtain clothing, food, or shelter--whether the simplest necessity\r\nor the greatest luxury of life--it is on money that the demand is first\r\nmade. As this rule operates throughout the entire range of commodities\r\nit is manifest that the demand for money equals at least the united\r\ndemands for all other things.\r\n\r\nWhile population remains stationary, the demand for money will remain\r\nthe same. As the demand for one article becomes less, the demand for\r\nsome other which shall take its place becomes greater. The demand for\r\nmoney, therefore, must ever be as pressing and urgent as the needs of\r\nman are varied, incessant, and importunate.\r\n\r\nSuch being the demand for money, what is the supply? It is the total\r\nnumber of units of money in circulation (actual or potential) in any\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe force of the demand for money operating against the supply is\r\nrepresented by the earnest, incessant struggle to obtain it. All men, in\r\nall trades and occupations, are offering either property or services\r\nfor money. Each shoemaker in each locality is in competition with every\r\nother shoemaker in the same locality, each hatter is in competition\r\nwith every other hatter, each clothier with every other clothier, all\r\noffering their wares for units of money. In this universal and perpetual\r\ncompetition for money, that number of shoemakers that can supply the\r\ndemand for shoes at the smallest average price (excellence of quality\r\nbeing taken into account) will fix the market value of shoes in money;\r\nand conversely, will fix the value of money in shoes. So with the\r\nhatters as to hats, so with the tailors as to clothes, and so with those\r\nengaged in all other occupations as to the products respectively of\r\ntheir labor.\r\n\r\nThe transcendent importance of money, and the constant pressure of the\r\ndemand for it, may be realized by comparing its utility with that of any\r\nother force that contributes to human welfare.\r\n\r\nIn all the broad range of articles that in a state of civilization are\r\nneeded by man, the only absolutely indispensable thing is money. For\r\neverything else there is some substitute--some alternative; for money\r\nthere is none. Among articles of food, if beef rises in price, the\r\ndemand for it will diminish, as a certain proportion of the people will\r\nresort to other forms of food. If, by reason of its continued scarcity,\r\nbeef continues to rise, the demand will further diminish, until finally\r\nit may altogether cease and centre on something else. So in the matter\r\nof clothing. If any one fabric becomes scarce, and consequently dear,\r\nthe demand will diminish, and, if the price continue rising, it is only\r\na question of time for the demand to cease and be transferred to some\r\nalternative.\r\n\r\nBut this cannot be the case with money. It can never be driven out of\r\nuse. There is not, and there never can be, any substitute for it. It\r\nmay become so scarce that one dollar at the end of a decade may buy ten\r\ntimes as much as at the beginning; that is to say, it may cost in labor\r\nor commodities ten times as much to get it, but at whatever cost, the\r\npeople must have it. Without money the demands of civilization could not\r\nbe supplied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS,\r\n\r\nOF NEW YORK (BORN 1824, DIED 1892.)\r\n\r\nON THE SPOILS SYSTEM AND THE PROGRESS OF CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.\r\n\r\nAn Address delivered before the American Social Science Association at\r\nits Meeting in Saratoga, New York, September 8, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwelve years ago I read a paper before this association upon reform\r\nin the Civil Service. The subject was of very little interest. A few\r\nnewspapers which were thought to be visionary occasionally discussed\r\nit, but the press of both parties smiled with profound indifference.\r\nMr. Jenckes had pressed it upon an utterly listless Congress, and his\r\nproposition was regarded as the harmless hobby of an amiable man, from\r\nwhich a little knowledge of practical politics would soon dismount him.\r\nThe English reform, which was by far the most significant political\r\nevent in that country since the parliamentary reform bill of 1832,\r\nwas virtually unknown to us. To the general public it was necessary\r\nto explain what the Civil Service was, how it was recruited, what the\r\nabuses were, and how and why they were to be remedied. Old professional\r\npoliticians, who look upon reform as Dr. Johnson defined patriotism, as\r\nthe last refuge of a scoundrel, either laughed at what they called the\r\npolitics of idiocy and the moon, or sneered bitterly that reformers were\r\ncheap hypocrites who wanted other people's places and lamented other\r\npeople's sins.\r\n\r\nThis general public indifference was not surprising. The great reaction\r\nof feeling which followed the war, the relaxation of the long-strained\r\nanxiety of the nation for its own existence, the exhaustion of the vast\r\nexpenditure of life and money, and the satisfaction with the general\r\nsuccess, had left little disposition to do anything but secure in the\r\nnational polity the legitimate results of the great contest. To the\r\ncountry, reform was a proposition to reform evils of administration\r\nof which it knew little, and which, at most, seemed to it petty\r\nand impertinent in the midst of great affairs. To Congress, it was\r\napparently a proposal to deprive members of the patronage which to many\r\nof them was the real gratification of their position, the only way in\r\nwhich they felt their distinction and power. To such members reform was\r\na plot to deprive the bear of his honey, the dog of his bone, and they\r\nstared and growled incredulously.\r\n\r\nThis was a dozen years ago. To-day the demand for reform is imperative.\r\nThe drop has become a deluge. Leading journals of both parties eagerly\r\nproclaim its urgent necessity. From New England to California public\r\nopinion is organizing itself in reform associations. In the great\r\ncustom-house and the great post-office of the country--those in the city\r\nof New York--reform has been actually begun upon definite principles\r\nand with remarkable success, and the good example has been followed\r\nelsewhere with the same results. A bill carefully prepared and providing\r\nfor gradual and thorough reform has been introduced with an admirable\r\nreport in the Senate of the United States. Mr. Pendleton, the Democratic\r\nSenator from Ohio, declares that the Spoils System which has debauched\r\nthe Civil Service of fifty millions of people must be destroyed. Mr.\r\nDawes, the Republican Senator from Massachusetts, summons all good\r\ncitizens to unite to suppress this gigantic evil which threatens\r\nthe republic. Conspicuous reformers sit in the Cabinet; and in this\r\nsorrowful moment, at least, the national heart and mind and conscience,\r\nstricken and bowed by a calamity whose pathos penetrates every\r\nhouse-hold in Christendom, cries to these warning words, \"Amen! Amen!\"\r\nLike the slight sound amid the frozen silence of the Alps that loosens\r\nand brings down the avalanche, the solitary pistol-shot of the 2d of\r\nJuly has suddenly startled this vast accumulation of public opinion\r\ninto conviction, and on every side thunders the rush and roar of its\r\noverwhelming descent, which will sweep away the host of evils bred of\r\nthis monstrous abuse.\r\n\r\nThis is an extraordinary change for twelve years, but it shows the\r\nvigorous political health, the alert common-sense, and the essential\r\npatriotism of the country, which are the earnest of the success of\r\nany wise reform. The war which naturally produced the lassitude and\r\nindifference to the subject which were evident twelve years ago had\r\nmade reform, indeed, a vital necessity, but the necessity was not then\r\nperceived. The dangers that attend a vast system of administration based\r\nto its least detail upon personal patronage were not first exposed by\r\nMr. Jenckes in 1867, but before that time they had been mainly discussed\r\nas possibilities and inferences. Yet the history of the old New York\r\ncouncil of appointment had illustrated in that State the party fury and\r\ncorruption which patronage necessarily breeds, and Governor McKean in\r\nPennsylvania, at the close of the last century, had made \"a clean sweep\"\r\nof the places within his power. The spoils spirit struggled desperately\r\nto obtain possession of the national administration from the day of\r\nJefferson's inauguration to that of Jackson's, when it succeeded.\r\nIts first great but undesigned triumph was the decision of the First\r\nCongress in 1789, vesting the sole power of removal in the President,\r\na decision which placed almost every position in the Civil Service\r\nunconditionally at his pleasure. This decision was determined by\r\nthe weight of Madison's authority. But Webster, nearly fifty years\r\nafterwards, opposing his authority to that of Madison, while admitting\r\nthe decision to have been final, declared it to have been wrong. The\r\nyear 1820, which saw the great victory of slavery in the Missouri\r\nCompromise, was also the year in which the second great triumph of the\r\nspoils system was gained, by the passage of the law which, under the\r\nplea of securing greater responsibility in certain financial offices,\r\nlimited such offices to a term of four years. The decision of 1789,\r\nwhich gave the sole power of removal to the President, required positive\r\nexecutive action to effect removal; but this law of 1820 vacated all the\r\nchief financial offices, with all the places dependent upon them, during\r\nthe term of every President, who, without an order of removal, could\r\nfill them all at his pleasure.\r\n\r\nA little later a change in the method of nominating the President from\r\na congressional caucus to a national convention still further developed\r\nthe power of patronage as a party resource, and in the session of\r\n1825-26, when John Quincy Adams was President, Mr. Benton introduced his\r\nreport upon Mr. Macon's resolution declaring the necessity of reducing\r\nand regulating executive patronage; although Mr. Adams, the last of the\r\nRevolutionary line of Presidents, so scorned to misuse patronage that he\r\nleaned backward in standing erect. The pressure for the overthrow of the\r\nconstitutional system had grown steadily more angry and peremptory\r\nwith the progress of the country, the development of party spirit,\r\nthe increase of patronage, the unanticipated consequences of the sole\r\nexecutive power of removal, and the immense opportunity offered by the\r\nfour-years' law. It was a pressure against which Jefferson held the\r\ngates by main force, which was relaxed by the war under Madison and the\r\nfusion of parties under Monroe, but which swelled again into a furious\r\ntorrent as the later parties took form. John Quincy Adams adhered, with\r\nthe tough tenacity of his father's son, to the best principles of all\r\nhis predecessors. He followed Washington, and observed the spirit of\r\nthe Constitution in refusing to remove for any reason but official\r\nmisconduct or incapacity. But he knew well what was coming, and\r\nwith characteristically stinging sarcasm he called General Jackson's\r\ninaugural address \"a threat of re-form.\" With Jackson's administration\r\nin 1830 the deluge of the spoils system burst over our national\r\npolitics. Sixteen years later, Mr. Buchanan said in a public speech\r\nthat General Taylor would be faithless to the Whig party if he did not\r\nproscribe Democrats. So high the deluge had risen which has ravaged and\r\nwasted our politics ever since, and the danger will be stayed only\r\nwhen every President, leaning upon the law, shall stand fast where John\r\nQuincy Adams stood.\r\n\r\nBut the debate continued during the whole Jackson administration. In\r\nthe Senate and on the stump, in elaborate reports and popular speeches,\r\nWebster, Calhoun, and Clay, the great political chiefs of their time,\r\nsought to alarm the country with the dangers of patronage. Sargent S.\r\nPrentiss, in the House of Representatives, caught up and echoed the cry\r\nunder the administration of Van Buren. But the country refused to be\r\nalarmed. As the Yankee said of the Americans at the battle of\r\nWhite Plains, where they were beaten, \"The fact is, as far as I can\r\nunderstand, our folks did n't seem to take no sort of interest in that\r\nbattle.\" The reason that the country took no sort of interest in the\r\ndiscussion of the evils of patronage was evident. It believed the\r\ndenunciation to be a mere party cry, a scream of disappointment and\r\nimpotence from those who held no places and controlled no patronage.\r\nIt heard the leaders of the opposition fiercely arraigning the\r\nadministration for proscription and universal wrong-doing, but it was\r\naccustomed by its English tradition and descent always to hear the\r\nTories cry that the Constitution was in danger when the Whigs were in\r\npower, and the Whigs under a Tory administration to shout that all was\r\nlost. It heard the uproar like the old lady upon her first railroad\r\njourney, who sat serene amid the wreck of a collision, and when asked\r\nif she was much hurt, looked over her spectacles and answered,\r\nblandly, \"Hurt? Why, I supposed they always stopped so in this kind of\r\ntravelling.\" The feeling that the denunciation was only a part of the\r\ngame of politics, and no more to be accepted as a true statement than\r\nSnug the joiner as a true lion, was confirmed by the fact that when the\r\nWhig opposition came into power with President Harrison, it adopted the\r\nvery policy which under Democratic administration it had strenuously\r\ndenounced as fatal. The pressure for place was even greater than it had\r\nbeen ten years before, and although Mr. Webster as Secretary of State\r\nmaintained his consistency by putting his name to an executive order\r\nasserting sound principles, the order was swept away like a lamb by a\r\nlocomotive.\r\n\r\nNothing but a miracle, said General Harrison's attorney-general, can\r\nfeed the swarm of hungry office-seekers.\r\n\r\nAdopted by both parties, Mr. Marcy's doctrine that the places in the\r\npublic service are the proper spoils of a victorious party, was accepted\r\nas a necessary condition of popular government. One of the highest\r\nofficers of the government expounded this doctrine to me long\r\nafterwards. \"I believe,\" said he, \"that when the people vote to change\r\na party administration they vote to change every person of the opposite\r\nparty who holds a place, from the President of the United States to\r\nthe messenger at my door.\" It is this extraordinary but sincere\r\nmisconception of the function of party in a free government that leads\r\nto the serious defence of the spoils system. Now, a party is merely a\r\nvoluntary association of citizens to secure the enforcement of a\r\ncertain policy of administration upon which they are agreed. In a free\r\ngovernment this is done by the election of legislators and of certain\r\nexecutive officers who are friendly to that policy. But the duty of the\r\ngreat body of persons employed in the minor administrative places is in\r\nno sense political. It is wholly ministerial, and the political opinions\r\nof such persons affect the discharge of their duties no more than their\r\nreligious views or their literary preferences. All that can be justly\r\nrequired of such persons, in the interest of the public business, is\r\nhonesty, intelligence, capacity, industry, and due subordination; and to\r\nsay that, when the policy of the Government is changed by the result\r\nof an election from protection to free-trade, every book-keeper and\r\nletter-carrier and messenger and porter in the public offices ought to\r\nbe a free-trader, is as wise as to say that if a merchant is a Baptist\r\nevery clerk in his office ought to be a believer in total immersion. But\r\nthe officer of whom I spoke undoubtedly expressed the general feeling.\r\nThe necessarily evil consequences of the practice which he justified\r\nseemed to be still speculative and inferential, and to the national\r\nindifference which followed the war the demand of Mr. Jenckes for reform\r\nappeared to be a mere whimsical vagary most inopportunely introduced.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, soon evident that the war had made the necessity of\r\nreform imperative, and chiefly for two reasons: first, the enormous\r\nincrease of patronage, and second, the fact that circumstances had\r\nlargely identified a party name with patriotism. The great and radical\r\nevil of the spoils system was carefully fostered by the apparent\r\nabsolute necessity to the public welfare of making political opinion and\r\nsympathy a condition of appointment to the smallest place. It is since\r\nthe war, therefore, that the evil has run riot and that its consequences\r\nhave been fully revealed. Those consequences are now familiar, and\r\nI shall not describe them. It is enough that the most patriotic and\r\nintelligent Americans and the most competent foreign observers agree\r\nthat the direct and logical results of that system are the dangerous\r\nconfusion of the executive and legislative powers of the Government;\r\nthe conversion of politics into mere place-hunting; the extension of the\r\nmischief to State and county and city administration, and the consequent\r\ndegradation of the national character; the practical disfranchisement of\r\nthe people wherever the system is most powerful; and the perversion of a\r\nrepublic of equal citizens into a despotism of venal politicians. These\r\nare the greatest dangers that can threaten a republic, and they are due\r\nto the practice of treating the vast system of minor public places which\r\nare wholly ministerial, and whose duties are the same under every party\r\nadministration, not as public trusts, but as party perquisites. The\r\nEnglish-speaking race has a grim sense of humor, and the absurdity of\r\ntransacting the public business of a great nation in a way which would\r\nruin both the trade and the character of a small huckster, of proceeding\r\nupon the theory--for such is the theory of the spoils system--that a man\r\nshould be put in charge of a locomotive because he holds certain views\r\nof original sin, or because he polishes boots nimbly with his tongue--it\r\nis a folly so stupendous and grotesque that when it is fully perceived\r\nby the shrewd mother-wit of the Yankee it will be laughed indignantly\r\nand contemptuously away. But the laugh must have the method, and the\r\nindignation the form, of law; and now that the public mind is aroused\r\nto the true nature and tendency of the spoils system is the time to\r\nconsider the practicable legal remedy for them.\r\n\r\nThe whole system of appointments in the Civil Service proceeds from the\r\nPresident, and in regard to his action the intention of the Constitution\r\nis indisputable. It is that the President shall appoint solely upon\r\npublic considerations, and that the officer appointed shall serve\r\nas long as he discharges his duty faithfully. This is shown in Mr.\r\nJefferson's familiar phrase in his reply to the remonstrance of the\r\nmerchants of New Haven against the removal of the collector of that\r\nport. Mr. Jefferson asserted that Mr. Adams had purposely appointed in\r\nthe last moments of his administration officers whose designation he\r\nshould have left to his successor. Alluding to these appointments, he\r\nsays: \"I shall correct the procedure, and that done, return with joy to\r\nthat state of things when the only question concerning a candidate shall\r\nbe, Is he honest? Is he capable? Is he faithful to the Constitution?\"\r\nMr. Jefferson here recognizes that these had been the considerations\r\nwhich had usually determined appointments; and Mr. Madison, in the\r\ndebate upon the President's sole power of removal, declared that if a\r\nPresident should remove an officer for any reason not connected with\r\nefficient service he would be impeached. Reform, therefore, is merely\r\na return to the principle and purpose of the Constitution and to the\r\npractice of the early administrations.\r\n\r\nWhat more is necessary, then, for reform than that the President should\r\nreturn to that practice? As all places in the Civil Service are filled\r\neither by his direct nomination or by officers whom he appoints, why has\r\nnot any President ample constitutional authority to effect at any moment\r\na complete and thorough reform? The answer is simple. He has the power.\r\nHe has always had it. A President has only to do as Washington did,\r\nand all his successors have only to do likewise, and reform would be\r\ncomplete. Every President has but to refuse to remove non-political\r\nofficers for political or personal reasons; to appoint only those whom\r\nhe knows to be competent; to renominate, as Monroe and John Quincy Adams\r\ndid, every faithful officer whose commission expires, and to require the\r\nheads of departments and all inferior appointing officers to conform to\r\nthis practice, and the work would be done. This is apparently a short\r\nand easy and constitutional method of reform, requiring no further\r\nlegislation or scheme of procedure. But why has no President adopted it?\r\nFor the same reason that the best of Popes does not reform the abuses\r\nof his Church. For the same reason that a leaf goes over Niagara. It is\r\nbecause the opposing forces are overpowering. The same high officer of\r\nthe government to whom I have alluded said to me as we drove upon the\r\nHeights of Washington, \"Do you mean that I ought not to appoint my\r\nsubordinates for whom I am responsible?\" I answered: \"I mean that you do\r\nnot appoint them now; I mean that if, when we return to the capital,\r\nyou hear that your chief subordinate is dead, you will not appoint\r\nhis successor. You will have to choose among the men urged upon you by\r\ncertain powerful politicians. Undoubtedly you ought to appoint the man\r\nwhom you believe to be the most fit. But you do not and can not. If\r\nyou could or did appoint such men only, and that were the rule of your\r\ndepartment and of the service, there would be no need of reform.\" And he\r\ncould not deny it. There was no law to prevent his selection of the\r\nbest man. Indeed, the law assumed that he would do it. The Constitution\r\nintended that he should do it. But when I reminded him that there were\r\nforces beyond the law that paralyzed the intention of the Constitution,\r\nand which would inevitably compel him to accept the choice of others, he\r\nsaid no more.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to assert that the reform of the Civil Service is an\r\nexecutive reform. So it is. But the Executive alone cannot accomplish\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe abuses are now completely and aggressively organized, and the\r\nsturdiest President would quail before them. The President who\r\nshould undertake, single-handed, to deal with the complication of\r\nadministrative evils known as the Spoils System would find his party\r\nleaders in Congress and their retainers throughout the country arrayed\r\nagainst him; the proposal to disregard traditions and practices which\r\nare regarded as essential to the very existence and effectiveness of\r\nparty organization would be stigmatized as treachery, and the President\r\nhimself would be covered with odium as a traitor. The air would hum with\r\ndenunciation. The measures he should favor, the appointments he might\r\nmake, the recommendations of his secretaries, would be opposed and\r\nimperilled, and the success of his administration would be endangered. A\r\nPresident who should alone undertake thoroughly to reform the evil must\r\nfeel it to be the vital and paramount issue, and must be willing to\r\nhazard everything for its success. He must have the absolute faith and\r\nthe indomitable will of Luther. \"Here stand I; I can no other.\" How can\r\nwe expect a President whom this system elects to devote himself to its\r\ndestruction? General Grant, elected by a spontaneous patriotic impulse,\r\nfresh from the regulated order of military life and new to politics and\r\npoliticians, saw the reason and the necessity of reform. The hero of a\r\nvictorious war, at the height of his popularity, his party in undisputed\r\nand seemingly indisputable supremacy, made the attempt. Congress,\r\ngood-naturedly tolerating what it considered his whim of inexperience,\r\ngranted money to try an experiment. The adverse pressure was tremendous.\r\n\"I am used to pressure,\" said the soldier. So he was, but not to this\r\npressure. He was driven by unknown and incalculable currents. He was\r\nenveloped in whirlwinds of sophistry, scorn, and incredulity. He who\r\nupon his own line had fought it out all summer to victory, upon a line\r\nabsolutely new and unknown was naturally bewildered and dismayed. So\r\nWellington had drawn the lines of victory on the Spanish Peninsula and\r\nhad saved Europe at Waterloo. But even Wellington at Waterloo could\r\nnot be also Sir Robert Peel at Westminster. Even Wellington, who had\r\noverthrown Napoleon in the field, could not also be the parliamentary\r\nhero who for the welfare of his country would dare to risk the overthrow\r\nof his party.\r\n\r\nWhen at last President Grant said, \"If Congress adjourns without\r\npositive legislation on Civil Service reform, I shall regard such action\r\nas a disapproval of the system and shall abandon it,\" it was, indeed,\r\na surrender, but it was the surrender of a champion who had honestly\r\nmistaken both the nature and the strength of the adversary and his own\r\npower of endurance.\r\n\r\nIt is not, then, reasonable, under the conditions of our Government and\r\nin the actual situation, to expect a President to go much faster or\r\nmuch further than public opinion. But executive action can aid most\r\neffectively the development and movement of that opinion, and the most\r\ndecisive reform measures that the present administration might take\r\nwould be undoubtedly supported by a powerful public sentiment. The\r\neducative results of resolute executive action, however limited and\r\nincomplete in scope, have been shown in the two great public offices\r\nof which I have spoken, the New York custom-house and the New York\r\npost-office. For nearly three years the entire practicability of reform\r\nhas been demonstrated in those offices, and solely by the direction of\r\nthe President. The value of such demonstrations, due to the Executive\r\nwill alone, carried into effect by thoroughly trained and interested\r\nsubordinates, cannot be overestimated. But when they depend upon the\r\nwill of a transient officer and not upon a strong public conviction,\r\nthey are seeds that have no depth of soil. A vital and enduring\r\nreform in administrative methods, although it be but a return to the\r\nconstitutional intention, can be accomplished only by the commanding\r\nimpulse of public opinion. Permanence is secured by law, not by\r\nindividual pleasure. But in this country law is only formulated public\r\nopinion. Reform of the Civil Service does not contemplate an invasion of\r\nthe constitutional prerogative of the President and the Senate, nor does\r\nit propose to change the Constitution by statute. The whole system\r\nof the Civil Service proceeds, as I said, from the President, and the\r\nobject of the reform movement is to enable him to fulfil the intention\r\nof the Constitution by revealing to him the desire of the country\r\nthrough the action of its authorized representatives. When the\r\nground-swell of public opinion lifts Congress from the rocks, the\r\nPresident will gladly float with it into the deep water of wise and\r\npatriotic action. The President, indeed, has never been the chief\r\nsinner in the Spoils System, although he has been the chief agent.\r\nEven President Jackson yielded to party pressure as much as to his own\r\nconvictions. President Harrison sincerely wished to stay the flood, but\r\nit swept him away. President Grant doubtfully and with good intentions\r\ntested the pressure before yielding. President Hayes, with sturdy\r\nindependence, adhered inflexibly to a few points, but his party chiefs\r\ncursed and derided him. President Garfield,--God bless and restore\r\nhim!--frankly declares permanent and effective reform to be impossible\r\nwithout the consent of Congress. When, therefore, Congress obeys a\r\ncommanding public opinion, and reflects it in legislation, it will\r\nrestore to the President the untrammelled exercise of his ample\r\nconstitutional powers according to the constitutional intention; and the\r\npractical question of reform is, How shall this be brought about?\r\n\r\nNow, it is easy to kill weeds if we can destroy their roots, and it\r\nis not difficult to determine what the principle of reform legislation\r\nshould be if we can agree upon the source of the abuses to be reformed.\r\nMay they not have a common origin? In fact, are they not all bound\r\ntogether as parts of one system? The Representative in Congress, for\r\ninstance, does not ask whether the interests of the public service\r\nrequire this removal or that appointment, but whether, directly or\r\nindirectly, either will best serve his own interests. The Senator acts\r\nfrom the same motives. The President, in turn, balances between the\r\npersonal interests of leading politicians--President, Senators,\r\nand Representatives all wishing to pay for personal service and to\r\nconciliate personal influence. So also the party labor required of the\r\nplace-holder, the task of carrying caucuses, of defeating one man and\r\nelecting another, as may be ordered, the payment of the assessment\r\nlevied upon his salary--all these are the price of the place. They are\r\nthe taxes paid by him as conditions of receiving a personal favor. Thus\r\nthe abuses have a common source, whatever may be the plea for the system\r\nfrom which they spring. Whether it be urged that the system is essential\r\nto party organization, or that the desire for place is a laudable\r\npolitical ambition, or that the Spoils System is a logical development\r\nof our political philosophy, or that new brooms sweep clean, or that\r\nany other system is un-American--whatever the form of the plea for the\r\nabuse, the conclusion is always the same, that the minor places in the\r\nCivil Service are not public trusts, but rewards and prizes for personal\r\nand political favorites.\r\n\r\nThe root of the complex evil, then, is personal favoritism. This\r\nproduces congressional dictation, senatorial usurpation, arbitrary\r\nremovals, interference in elections, political assessments, and all\r\nthe consequent corruption, degradation, and danger that experience has\r\ndisclosed. The method of reform, therefore, must be a plan of selection\r\nfor appointment which makes favoritism impossible. The general feeling\r\nundoubtedly is that this can be accomplished by a fixed limited term.\r\nBut the terms of most of the offices to which the President and the\r\nSenate appoint, and upon which the myriad minor places in the service\r\ndepend, have been fixed and limited for sixty years, yet it is during\r\nthat very period that the chief evils of personal patronage have\r\nappeared. The law of 1820, which limited the term of important revenue\r\noffices to four years, and which was afterwards extended to other\r\noffices, was intended, as John Quincy Adams tells us, to promote the\r\nelection to the presidency of Mr. Crawford, who was then Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury. The law was drawn by Mr. Crawford himself, and it was\r\nintroduced into the Senate by one of his devoted partisans. It placed\r\nthe whole body of executive financial officers at the mercy of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury and of a majority of the Senate, and its\r\ndesign, as Mr. Adams says, \"was to secure for Mr. Crawford the influence\r\nof all the incumbents in office, at the peril of displacement, and of\r\nfive or ten times an equal number of ravenous office-seekers, eager\r\nto supplant them.\" This is the very substance of the Spoils System,\r\nintentionally introduced by a fixed limitation of term in place of the\r\nconstitutional tenure of efficient service; and it was so far successful\r\nthat it made the custom-house officers, district attorneys, marshals,\r\nregisters of the land-office, receivers of public money, and even\r\npaymasters in the army, notoriously active partisans of Mr. Crawford.\r\nMr. Benton says that the four-years' law merely made the dismissal\r\nof faithful officers easier, because the expiration of the term\r\nwas regarded as \"the creation of a vacancy to be filled by new\r\nappointments.\" A fixed limited term for the chief offices has not\r\ndestroyed or modified personal influence, but, on the contrary, it\r\nhas fostered universal servility and loss of self-respect, because\r\nreappointment depends, not upon official fidelity and efficiency, but\r\nupon personal influence and favor. To fix by law the terms of places\r\ndependent upon such offices would be like an attempt to cure hydrophobia\r\nby the bite of a mad dog. The incumbent would be always busy keeping his\r\ninfluence in repair to secure reappointment, and the applicant would be\r\nequally busy in seeking such influence to procure the place, and as the\r\nfixed terms would be constantly expiring, the eager and angry intrigue\r\nand contest of influence would be as endless as it is now. This\r\ncertainly would not be reform.\r\n\r\nBut would not reform be secured by adding to a fixed limited term the\r\nsafeguard of removal for cause only? Removal for cause alone means, of\r\ncourse, removal for legitimate cause, such as dishonesty, negligence,\r\nor incapacity. But who shall decide that such cause exists? This must be\r\ndetermined either by the responsible superior officer or by some other\r\nauthority. But if left to some other authority the right of counsel\r\nand the forms of a court would be invoked; the whole legal machinery of\r\nmandamuses, injunctions, _certioraris_, and the rules of evidence would\r\nbe put in play to keep an incompetent clerk at his desk or a sleepy\r\nwatchman on his beat. Cause for the removal of a letter-carrier in the\r\npost-office or of an accountant in the custom-house would be presented\r\nwith all the pomp of impeachment and established like a high crime\r\nand misdemeanor. Thus every clerk in every office would have a kind of\r\nvested interest in his place because, however careless, slovenly, or\r\ntroublesome he might be, he could be displaced only by an elaborate\r\nand doubtful legal process. Moreover, if the head of a bureau or\r\na collector, or a postmaster were obliged to prove negligence, or\r\ninsolence, or incompetency against a clerk as he would prove theft,\r\nthere would be no removals from the public service except for crimes\r\nof which the penal law takes cognizance. Consequently, removal would be\r\nalways and justly regarded as a stigma upon character, and a man removed\r\nfrom a position in a public office would be virtually branded as a\r\nconvicted criminal. Removal for cause, therefore, if the cause were\r\nto be decided by any authority but that of the responsible superior\r\nofficer, instead of improving, would swiftly and enormously enhance\r\nthe cost, and ruin the efficiency, of the public service, by destroying\r\nsubordination, and making every lazy and worthless member of it twice as\r\ncareless and incompetent as he is now.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the legitimate cause for removal ought to be determined in\r\npublic as in private business by the responsible appointing power, it is\r\nof the highest public necessity that the exercise of that power should\r\nbe made as absolutely honest and independent as possible. But how can\r\nit be made honest and independent if it is not protected so far as\r\npracticable from the constant bribery of selfish interest and the\r\nillicit solicitation of personal influence? The experience of our large\r\npatronage offices proves conclusively that the cause of the larger\r\nnumber of removals is not dishonesty or incompetency; it is the desire\r\nto make vacancies to fill. This is the actual cause, whatever cause may\r\nbe assigned. The removals would not be made except for the pressure of\r\npoliticians. But those politicians would not press for removals if they\r\ncould not secure the appointment of their favorites. Make it impossible\r\nfor them to secure appointment, and the pressure would instantly\r\ndisappear and arbitrary removal cease.\r\n\r\nSo long, therefore, as we permit minor appointments to be made by mere\r\npersonal influence and favor, a fixed limited term and removal during\r\nthat term for cause only would not remedy the evil, because the\r\nincumbents would still be seeking influence to secure re-appointment,\r\nand the aspirants doing the same to replace them. Removal under plea\r\nof good cause would be as wanton and arbitrary as it is now, unless the\r\npower to remove were intrusted to some other discretion than that of the\r\nsuperior officer, and in that case the struggle for reappointment and\r\nthe knowledge that removal for the term was practically impossible would\r\ntotally demoralize the service. To make sure, then, that removals shall\r\nbe made for legitimate cause only, we must provide that appointment\r\nshall be made only for legitimate cause.\r\n\r\nAll roads lead to Rome. Personal influence in appointments can be\r\nannulled only by free and open competition. By that bridge we can return\r\nto the practice of Washington and to the intention of the Constitution.\r\nThat is the shoe of swiftness and the magic sword by which the President\r\ncan pierce and outrun the protean enemy of sophistry and tradition which\r\nprevents him from asserting his power. If you say that success in\r\na competitive literary examination does not prove fitness to adjust\r\ncustoms duties, or to distribute letters, or to appraise linen, or to\r\nmeasure molasses, I answer that the reform does not propose that fitness\r\nshall be proved by a competitive literary examination. It proposes to\r\nannul personal influence and political favoritism by making appointment\r\ndepend upon proved capacity. To determine this it proposes first to test\r\nthe comparative general intelligence of all applicants and their special\r\nknowledge of the particular official duties required, and then to prove\r\nthe practical faculty of the most intelligent applicants by actual trial\r\nin the performance of the duties before they are appointed. If it be\r\nstill said that success in such a competition may not prove fitness, it\r\nis enough to reply that success in obtaining the favor of some kind of\r\nboss, which is the present system, presumptively proves unfitness.\r\n\r\nNor is it any objection to the reformed system that many efficient\r\nofficers in the service could not have entered it had it been necessary\r\nto pass an examination; it is no objection, because their efficiency is\r\na mere chance. They were not appointed because of efficiency, but either\r\nbecause they were diligent politicians or because they were recommended\r\nby diligent politicians. The chance of getting efficient men in any\r\nbusiness is certainly not diminished by inquiry and investigation. I\r\nhave heard an officer in the army say that he could select men from\r\nthe ranks for special duty much more satisfactorily than they could be\r\nselected by an examination. Undoubtedly he could, because he knows\r\nhis men, and he selects solely by his knowledge of their comparative\r\nfitness. If this were true of the Civil Service, if every appointing\r\nofficer chose the fittest person from those that he knew, there would\r\nbe no need of reform. It is because he cannot do this that the reform is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nIt is the same kind of objection which alleges that competition is a\r\ndroll plan by which to restore the conduct of the public business to\r\nbusiness principles and methods, since no private business selects\r\nits agents by competition. But the managers of private business are\r\nvirtually free from personal influence in selecting their subordinates,\r\nand they employ and promote and dismiss them solely for the interests\r\nof the business. Their choice, however, is determined by an actual,\r\nalthough not a formal, competition. Like the military officer, they\r\nselect those whom they know by experience to be the most competent. But\r\nif great business-houses and corporations were exposed to persistent,\r\ninsolent, and overpowering interference and solicitation for place\r\nsuch as obstructs great public departments and officers, they too would\r\nresort to the form of competition, as they now have its substance, and\r\nthey would resort to it to secure the very freedom which they now enjoy\r\nof selecting for fitness alone.\r\n\r\nMr. President, in the old Arabian story, from the little box upon the\r\nsea-shore, carelessly opened by the fisherman, arose the towering and\r\nhaughty demon, ever more monstrous and more threatening, who would not\r\ncrouch again. So from the small patronage of the earlier day, from a\r\nCivil Service dealing with a national revenue of only $2,000,000, and\r\nregulated upon sound business principles, has sprung the un-American,\r\nun-Democratic, un-Republican system which destroys political\r\nindependence, honor, and morality, and corrodes the national character\r\nitself. In the solemn anxiety of this hour the warning words of the\r\naustere Calhoun, uttered nearly half a century ago, echo in startled\r\nrecollection like words of doom: \"If you do not put this thing down it\r\nwill put you down.\" Happily it is the historic faith of the race from\r\nwhich we are chiefly sprung, that eternal vigilance is the price of\r\nliberty. It is that faith which has made our mother England the great\r\nparent of free States. The same faith has made America the political\r\nhope of the world. Fortunately removed by our position from the\r\nentanglements of European politics, and more united and peaceful at home\r\nthan at any time within the memory of living men, the moment is most\r\nauspicious for remedying that abuse in our political system whose\r\nnature, proportions, and perils the whole country begins clearly to\r\ndiscern. The will and the power to apply the remedy will be a test of\r\nthe sagacity and the energy of the people. The reform of which I have\r\nspoken is essentially the people's reform. With the instinct of robbers\r\nwho run with the crowd and lustily cry \"Stop thief!\" those who would\r\nmake the public service the monopoly of a few favorites denounce the\r\ndetermination to open that service to the whole people as a plan to\r\nestablish an aristocracy. The huge ogre of patronage, gnawing at the\r\ncharacter, the honor, and the life of the country, grimly sneers that\r\nthe people cannot help themselves and that nothing can be done. But much\r\ngreater things have been done. Slavery was the Giant Despair of many\r\ngood men of the last generation, but slavery was overthrown. If\r\nthe Spoils System, a monster only less threatening than slavery, be\r\nunconquerable, it is because the country has lost its convictions,\r\nits courage, and its common-sense. \"I expect,\" said the Yankee as he\r\nsurveyed a stout antagonist, \"I expect that you 're pretty ugly, but I\r\ncal'late I 'm a darned sight uglier.\" I know that patronage is strong,\r\nbut I believe that the American people are very much stronger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARL SCHURZ,\r\n\r\nOF NEW YORK. (BORN 1829.)\r\n\r\nTHE NECESSITY AND PROGRESS OF CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.\r\n\r\nAn Address delivered at the Annual Meeting of the National Civil Service\r\nReform League at Chicago, Ill., December 12, 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Civil Service reform demands, is simply that the business part of\r\nthe Government shall be carried on in a sound, business-like manner.\r\nThis seems so obviously reasonable that among people of common-sense\r\nthere should be no two opinions about it. And the condition of things\r\nto be reformed is so obviously unreasonable, so flagrantly absurd\r\nand vicious, that we should not believe it could possibly exist among\r\nsensible people, had we not become accustomed to its existence among\r\nourselves. In truth, we can hardly bring the whole exorbitance of that\r\nviciousness and absurdity home to our own minds unless we contemplate it\r\nas reflected in the mirror of a simile.\r\n\r\nImagine, then, a bank, the stockholders of which, many in number, are\r\ndivided into two factions--let us call them the Jones party and the\r\nSmith party--who quarrel about some question of business policy, as, for\r\ninstance, whether the bank is to issue currency or not. The Jones\r\nparty is in control, but the Smith men persuade over to their side a\r\nsufficient number of Jones men to give them--the Smith men--a majority\r\nat the next stockholders' meeting. Thus they succeed in getting the\r\nupper hand. They oust the old board of directors, and elect a new board\r\nconsisting of Smith men. The new Smith board at once remove all the\r\nofficers, president, cashier, tellers, book-keepers, and clerks, down to\r\nthe messenger boys--the good and the bad alike--simply because they are\r\nJones men, and fill their places forth-with with new persons who are\r\nselected, not on the ground that they have in any way proved their\r\nfitness for the positions so filled, but simply because they are Smith\r\nmen; and those of the Smith men who have shown the greatest zeal and\r\nskill in getting a majority of votes for the Smith party are held to\r\nhave the strongest claims for salaried places in the bank. The new men\r\nstruggle painfully with the duties novel to them until they acquire some\r\nexperience, but even then, it needs in many instances two men or more to\r\ndo the work of one.\r\n\r\nIn the course of events dissatisfaction spreads among the stockholders\r\nwith the Smith management, partly shared by ambitious Smith men who\r\nthought themselves entitled to reward in the shape of places and\r\nsalaries, but were \"left out in the cold.\" Now the time for a new\r\nstockholders' meeting arrives. After a hot fight the Jones party carries\r\nthe day. Its ticket of directors being elected, off go the heads of\r\nthe Smith president, the Smith cashier, the Smith tellers, the Smith\r\nbookkeepers, and clerks, to be replaced by true-blue Jones men, who have\r\ndone the work of the campaign and are expected to do more of it when\r\nthe next election comes. And so the career of the bank goes on with its\r\nperiodical changes of party in power at longer or shorter intervals, and\r\nits corresponding clean sweeps of the bank service, with mismanagement\r\nand occasional fraud and peculation as inevitable incidents.\r\n\r\nYou might watch the proceedings of such a banking concern with intense\r\ncuriosity and amusement. But I ask you, what prudent man among you would\r\ndeposit his money in it, or invest in its stock? And why would you not?\r\nBecause you would think that this is not sensible men's business, but\r\nfoolish boys' play; that such management would necessarily result in\r\nreckless waste and dishonesty, and tend to land many of the bank's\r\nofficers in Canada, and not a few of its depositors or investors in the\r\npoor-house. Such would be your judgment, and in pronouncing it you\r\nwould at the same time pronounce judgment upon the manner in which the\r\nbusiness part of our national Government, as well as of many if not most\r\nof our State and municipal governments, has been conducted for several\r\ngenerations. This is the spoils system. And I have by no means presented\r\nan exaggerated or even a complete picture of it; nay, rather a mild\r\nsketch, indicating only with faint touches the demoralizing influences\r\nexercised by that system with such baneful effect upon the whole\r\npolitical life of the nation.\r\n\r\nLooking at the financial side of the matter alone--it is certainly bad\r\nenough; it is indeed almost incomprehensible how the spoils system could\r\nbe permitted through scores of years to vitiate our business methods\r\nin the conduct of the national revenue service, the postal service, the\r\nIndian service, the public-land service, involving us in indescribable\r\nadministrative blunders, bringing about Indian wars, causing immense\r\nlosses in the revenue, breeding extravagant and plundering practices\r\nin all Departments, costing our people in the course of time untold\r\nhundreds of millions of money, and making our Government one of the\r\nmost wasteful in the world. All this, I say, is bad enough. It might be\r\ncalled discreditable enough to move any self-respecting people to shame.\r\nBut the spoils system has inflicted upon the American people injuries\r\nfar greater than these.\r\n\r\nThe spoils system, that practice which turns public offices, high\r\nand low, from public trusts into objects of prey and booty for the\r\nvictorious party, may without extravagance of language be called one of\r\nthe greatest criminals in our history, if not the greatest. In the whole\r\ncatalogue of our ills there is none more dangerous to the vitality of\r\nour free institutions.\r\n\r\nIt tends to divert our whole political life from its true aims. It\r\nteaches men to seek something else in politics than the public good.\r\n\r\nIt puts mercenary selfishness as the motive power for political action\r\nin the place of public spirit, and organizes that selfishness into a\r\ndominant political force.\r\n\r\nIt attracts to active party politics the worst elements of our\r\npopulation, and with them crowds out the best. It transforms political\r\nparties from associations of patriotic citizens, formed to serve a\r\npublic cause, into bands of mercenaries using a cause to serve them. It\r\nperverts party contests from contentions of opinion into scrambles for\r\nplunder. By stimulating the mercenary spirit it promotes the corrupt use\r\nof money in party contests and in elections.\r\n\r\nIt takes the leadership of political organizations out of the hands of\r\nmen fit to be leaders of opinion and workers for high aims, and turns it\r\nover to the organizers and leaders of bands of political marauders. It\r\ncreates the boss and the machine, putting the boss into the place of the\r\nstatesman, and the despotism of the machine in the place of an organized\r\npublic opinion.\r\n\r\nIt converts the public office-holder, who should be the servant of the\r\npeople, into the servant of a party or of an influential politician,\r\nextorting from him time and work which should belong to the public, and\r\nmoney which he receives from the public for public service. It corrupts\r\nhis sense of duty by making him understand that his obligation to his\r\nparty or his political patron is equal if not superior to his obligation\r\nto the public interest, and that his continuance in office does not\r\ndepend on his fidelity to duty. It debauches his honesty by seducing\r\nhim to use the opportunities of his office to indemnify himself for\r\nthe burdens forced upon him as a party slave. It undermines in all\r\ndirections the discipline of the public service.\r\n\r\nIt falsifies our constitutional system. It leads to the usurpation, in\r\na large measure, of the executive power of appointment by members of the\r\nlegislative branch, substituting their irresponsible views of personal\r\nor party interest for the judgment as to the public good and the sense\r\nof responsibility of the Executive. It subjects those who exercise the\r\nappointing power, from the President of the United States down, to the\r\nintrusion of hordes of office-hunters and their patrons, who rob them of\r\nthe time and strength they should devote to the public interest. It has\r\nalready killed two of our Presidents, one, the first Harrison, by worry,\r\nand the other, Garfield, by murder; and more recently it has killed a\r\nmayor in Chicago and a judge in Tennessee.\r\n\r\nIt degrades our Senators and Representatives in Congress to the\r\ncontemptible position of office-brokers, and even of mere agents of\r\noffice-brokers, making the business of dickering about spoils as weighty\r\nto them as their duties as legislators. It introduces the patronage\r\nas an agency of corrupt influence between the Executive and the\r\nLegislature. It serves to obscure the criminal character of bribery\r\nby treating bribery with offices as a legitimate practice. It thus\r\nreconciles the popular mind to practices essentially corrupt, and\r\nthereby debauches the popular sense of right and wrong in politics.\r\n\r\nIt keeps in high political places, to the exclusion of better men,\r\npersons whose only ability consists in holding a personal following\r\nby adroit manipulation of the patronage. It has thus sadly lowered the\r\nstandard of statesmanship in public position, compared with the high\r\norder of ability displayed in all other walks of life.\r\n\r\nIt does more than anything else to turn our large municipalities into\r\nsinks of corruption, to render Tammany Halls possible, and to make of\r\nthe police force here and there a protector of crime and a terror to\r\nthose whose safety it is to guard. It exposes us, by the scandalous\r\nspectacle of its periodical spoils carnivals, to the ridicule and\r\ncontempt of civilized mankind, promoting among our own people the growth\r\nof serious doubts as to the practicability of democratic institutions on\r\na great scale; and in an endless variety of ways it introduces into\r\nour political life more elements of demoralization, debasement, and\r\ndecadence than any other agency of evil I know of, aye, perhaps more\r\nthan all other agencies of evil combined.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the injuries the spoils system has been, and still\r\nis, inflicting upon this Republic--some, I say; not all, for it is\r\nimpossible to follow its subtle virus into all the channels through\r\nwhich it exercises its poisonous influence. But I have said enough to\r\nillustrate its pernicious effects; and what I have said is only the\r\nteaching of sober observation and long experience.\r\n\r\nAnd now, if such are the evils of the spoils system, what are, by way of\r\ncompensation, the virtues it possesses, and the benefits it confers?\r\nLet its defenders speak. They do not pretend that it gives us a very\r\nefficient public service; but they tell us that it is essentially\r\nAmerican; that it is necessary in order to keep alive among our people\r\nan active interest in public affairs; that frequent rotation in office\r\nserves to give the people an intelligent insight in the nature and\r\nworkings of their Government; that without it parties cannot be held\r\ntogether, and party government is impossible; and that all the officers\r\nand employees of the Government should be in political harmony with the\r\nparty in power. Let us pass the points of this defence in review one by\r\none.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, in what sense can the spoils system be called essentially\r\nAmerican? Certainly not as to its origin. At the beginning of our\r\nnational Government nothing like it was known here, or dreamed of. Had\r\nanything like it been proposed, the fathers of the Republic would have\r\nrepelled it with alarm and indignation. It did, indeed, prevail in\r\nEngland when the monarchy was much stronger than it is now, and when\r\nthe aristocracy could still be called a ruling class. But as the British\r\nGovernment grew more democratic, the patronage system, as a relic of\r\nfeudalism, had to yield to the forces of liberalism and enlightenment\r\nuntil it completely disappeared. When it invaded our national\r\nGovernment, forty years after its constitutional beginning, we merely\r\ntook what England was casting off as an abuse inconsistent with popular\r\ngovernment, and unworthy of a free and civilized nation. If not in\r\norigin, is the spoils system essentially American in any other sense?\r\nOnly in the sense in which murder is American, or small-pox, or highway\r\nrobbery, or Tammany Hall.\r\n\r\nAs to the spoils system being necessary to the end of keeping alive\r\namong our people an active interest in public affairs--where is the\r\nAmerican who does not blush to utter such an infamous calumny? Is there\r\nno patriotism in America without plunder in sight? Was there no public\r\nspirit before spoils systems and clean sweeps cursed us, none between\r\nthe battle of Lexington and Jackson's inauguration as President? Such\r\nan argument deserves as an answer only a kick from every honest American\r\nboot.\r\n\r\nI admit, however, that there are among us some persons whose interest\r\nin public affairs does need the stimulus of office to remain alive. I\r\nam far from denying that the ambition to serve one's country as a public\r\nofficer is in itself a perfectly legitimate and honorable ambition. It\r\ncertainly is. But when a man's interest in public affairs depends upon\r\nhis drawing an official salary, or having such a salary in prospect, the\r\nambition does not appear so honorable. There is too pungent a mercenary\r\nflavor about it. No doubt, even among the mercenaries may be found\r\nindividuals that are capable, faithful, and useful; but taking them as\r\na class, the men whose active public spirit is conditional upon the\r\npossession or prospect of official spoil are those whose interest in\r\npublic affairs the commonweal can most conveniently spare. Indeed, our\r\npolitical life would be in a much healthier condition if they did not\r\ntake any part in politics at all. There would be plenty of patriotic\r\nAmericans to devote themselves to the public good without such a\r\ncondition. In fact, there would be more of that class in regular\r\npolitical activity than there are now, for they would not be jostled out\r\nby the pushing hordes of spoils-hunters, whose real interest in public\r\naffairs is that of serving themselves. The spoils system is therefore\r\nnot only not a stimulus of true public spirit, but in spreading\r\nthe mercenary tendency among the people it has served to baffle and\r\ndiscourage true public spirit by the offensive infusion in political\r\nlife of the mercenary element.\r\n\r\nThe view that the spoils system with its frequent rotations in office is\r\nneeded to promote among the people a useful understanding of the nature\r\nand workings of the Government, finds, amazing as it may seem, still\r\nserious adherents among well-meaning citizens. It is based upon the\r\nassumption that the public service which is instituted to do certain\r\nbusiness for the people, should at the same time serve as a school in\r\nwhich ignorant persons are to learn something about the functions of\r\nthe Government. These two objects will hardly go together. If the public\r\nservice is to do its business with efficiency and economy, it must of\r\ncourse be manned with persons fit for the work. If on the other hand it\r\nis to be used as a school to instruct ignorant people in the functions\r\nof the Government--that is, in the duties of a postmaster, or a revenue\r\ncollector, or an Indian agent, or a Department clerk--then we should\r\nselect for such places persons who know least about them, for they have\r\nthe most to learn; and inasmuch as such persons, before having acquired\r\nthe necessary knowledge, skill, and experience, will inevitably do\r\nthe public business in a bungling manner, and therefore at much\r\ninconvenience and loss to the people, they should, in justice to\r\nthe taxpayers, instead of drawing salaries, pay something for the\r\ninstruction they receive. For as soon as they have learned enough really\r\nto earn a salary, they will have to be turned out to make room for\r\nothers, who are as ignorant and in as great need of instruction as the\r\noutgoing set had been before. Evidently this kindergarten theory of\r\nthe public service is hardly worth discussion. The school of the spoils\r\nsystem, as it has been in operation since 1829, has educated thousands\r\nof political loafers, but not one political sage.\r\n\r\nThat the Government will not work satisfactorily unless all its officers\r\nand employees are in political harmony with the ruling party, is also\r\none of those superstitions which some estimable people have not yet been\r\nable to shake off. While they sternly resist the argument that there is\r\nno Democratic and no Republican way of sorting letters, or of collecting\r\ntaxes, or of treating Indians, as theoretical moonshine, their belief\r\nmust, after all, have received a rude shock by the conduct of the last\r\nthree national Administrations, including the present one.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1885, after twenty-four years of Republican ascendency, the\r\nDemocrats came into power, President Cleveland determined that, as a\r\ngeneral rule, officers holding places covered by the four-years-term law\r\nshould, if they had conducted themselves irreproachably, be permitted to\r\nserve out their four-years terms. How strictly this rule was adhered to\r\nI will not now inquire. At any rate it was adhered to in a great many\r\ncases. Many Republican office-holders, under that four-years rule,\r\nremained in place one, or two, or three years under the Democratic\r\nAdministration. President Harrison, succeeding Mr. Cleveland, followed\r\na similar rule, although to a less extent. And now President Cleveland\r\nagain does the same. Not only did we have during his first term the\r\nstartling spectacle of the great post-office of New York City remaining\r\nin the hands of a postmaster who was not a Democrat, but recently of\r\nthe Collectorship of the port of New York, once considered the most\r\nimportant political office in the country, being left for a year or more\r\nin possession of a Republican.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, the Presidents who acted thus did not believe that the\r\npublic interest required all the officers of the Government to be in\r\nharmony with the party in power. On the contrary, they thought that\r\nthe public interest was served by keeping efficient officers in their\r\nplaces, for a considerable time at least, although they were not in such\r\nharmony. And no doubt all sensible people admit that the common weal did\r\nnot suffer therefrom. The theory of the necessity of political accord\r\nbetween the administrative officers of the Government and the party\r\nin power has thus been thoroughly exploded by actual practice and\r\nexperience. Being obliged to admit this, candid men, it is to be hoped,\r\nwill go a step further in their reasoning. If those two Presidents\r\nwere right in thinking that the public welfare was served by keeping\r\nmeritorious officers not belonging to the ruling party in place until\r\nthey had served four years, is it not wrong to deprive the country of\r\nthe services of such men, made especially valuable by their accumulated\r\nexperience and the training of their skill, by turning them out after\r\nthe lapse of the four years? If it was for the public interest to keep\r\nthem so long, is it not against the public interest not to keep them\r\nlonger?\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nBut all these evidences of progress I regard as of less importance than\r\nthe strength our cause has gained in public sentiment. Of this we had\r\na vivid illustration when a year ago, upon the motion of Mr. Richard\r\nWatson Gilder, the Anti-Spoils League was set on foot for the purpose\r\nof opening communication and facilitating correspondence and, in case\r\nof need, concert of action with the friends of Civil Service reform\r\nthroughout the country, and when, in a short space of time, about 10,000\r\ncitizens sent in their adhesion, representing nearly every State\r\nand Territory of the Union, and in them, the most enlightened and\r\ninfluential classes of society.\r\n\r\nMore encouraging still is the circumstance that now for the first time\r\nwe welcome at our annual meeting not only the familiar faces of\r\nold friends, but also representatives of other organizations--Good\r\nGovernment clubs, working for the purification of politics; municipal\r\nleagues, whose aim is the reform of municipal governments; and\r\ncommercial bodies, urging the reform of our consular service. We welcome\r\nthem with especial warmth, for their presence proves that at last\r\nthe true significance of Civil Service reform is being appreciated in\r\nconstantly widening circles. The Good Government Club understands that\r\nif the moral tone of our politics, national or local, is to be lifted\r\nup, the demoralizing element of party spoil must be done away with. The\r\nMunicipal League understands that if our large municipalities are to be\r\nno longer cesspools of corruption, if our municipal governments are to\r\nbe made honest and business-like, if our police forces are to be kept\r\nclear of thugs and thieves, the appointments to places in the municipal\r\nservice must be withdrawn from the influence of party bosses and\r\nward ruffians, and must be strictly governed by the merit system. The\r\nmerchants understand that if our consular service is to be an effective\r\nhelp to American commerce, and a credit to the American name, it must\r\nnot be subject to periodical partisan lootings, and our consuls must not\r\nbe appointed by way of favor to some influential politician, but upon\r\na methodical ascertainment of their qualifications for the consular\r\nbusiness; then to be promoted according to merit, and also to be\r\nsalaried as befits respectable agents and representatives of a great\r\nnation. With this understanding, every Good Government Club, every\r\nMunicipal League, every Chamber of Commerce or Board of Trade must be\r\nan active Civil Service Reform Association. But more than this. Every\r\nintelligent and unprejudiced citizen, when he candidly inquires into the\r\ndevelopments which have brought about the present state of things, will\r\nunderstand that of the evils which have so alarmingly demoralized our\r\npolitical life, and so sadly lowered this Republic in the respect of the\r\nworld, many, if not most, had their origin, and find their sustenance,\r\nin that practice which treats the public offices as the plunder of\r\nvictorious parties; that as, with the increase of our population, the\r\ngrowth of our wealth, and the multiplication of our public interests,\r\nthe functions of government expand and become more complicated, those\r\nevils will grow and eventually destroy the very vitality of our free\r\ninstitutions, unless their prolific source be stopped; that this force\r\ncan be effectually stopped not by mere occasional spasms of indignant\r\nvirtue, but only by a systematic, thorough, and permanent reform. Every\r\npatriotic citizen understanding this must be a Civil Service reformer.\r\n\r\nYou may ask how far this understanding has penetrated our population.\r\nPresident Cleveland answers this question in his recent message. Listen\r\nto what he says: \"The advantages to the public service of an adherence\r\nto the principles of Civil Service Reform are constantly more apparent,\r\nand nothing is so encouraging to those in official life who honestly\r\ndesire good government, as the increasing appreciation by our people of\r\nthese advantages. A vast majority of the voters of the land are ready to\r\ninsist that the time and attention of those they select to perform for\r\nthem important public duties should not be distracted by doling out\r\nminor offices, and they are growing to be unanimous in regarding party\r\norganization as something that should be used in establishing party\r\nprinciples instead of dictating the distribution of public places as\r\nrewards for partisan activity.\"\r\n\r\nWith gladness I welcome this cheering assurance, coming from so high an\r\nauthority. If such is the sense of \"a vast majority of the voters of the\r\nland, growing to be unanimous,\" it may justly be called the will of\r\nthe people. If it is the will of the people, what reason--nay, what\r\nexcuse--can there be for further hesitation? Let the will of the people\r\nbe done! Let it be done without needless delay, and let the people's\r\nPresident lead in doing it! Then no more spoils and plunder! No more\r\nremovals not required by public interest! No more appointments for\r\npartisan reasons! Continuance in office, regardless of any four-years\r\nrule, of meritorious public servants! Superior merit the only title to\r\npreferment! No longer can this be airily waved aside as a demand of a\r\nmere sect of political philosophers, for now it is recognized as the\r\npeople's demand. No longer can Civil Service reform be cried down by\r\nthe so-called practical politicians as the nebulous dream of unpractical\r\nvisionaries, for it has been grasped by the popular understanding as a\r\npractical necessity--not to enervate our political life, but to lift\r\nit to a higher moral plane; not to destroy political parties, but to\r\nrestore them to their legitimate functions; not to make party government\r\nimpossible, but to guard it against debasement, and to inspire it with\r\nhigher ambitions; not pretending to be in itself the consummation of all\r\nreforms, but being the Reform without which other reformatory efforts in\r\ngovernment cannot be permanently successful.\r\n\r\nNever, gentlemen, have we met under auspices more propitious. Let no\r\nexertion be spared to make the voice of the people heard. For when it is\r\nheard in its strength it will surely be obeyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's American Eloquence, Volume IV. (of 4), by Various",
